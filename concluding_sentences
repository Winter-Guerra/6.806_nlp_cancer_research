In conclusion, chrysin decreased hypoxic survival, inhibited STAT3 activation, and diminished VEGF expression in hypoxic cancer cells, leading to abrogation of hypoxia-induced angiogenesis and resulting in suppression of metastatic growth (Fig. 5). This study also suggests that chrysin is a potential chemopreventive as well as an adjuvant agent, that can be used in combination with other antimetastatic agents to control metastatic progression of tumors.

In conclusion, the anticancer effect of _A. syzygii_ strain secretions depends on the induction of apoptosis in cancer cells. However, several investigations should be conducted to precisely determine the effective compounds to be used as anticancer therapeutics in the future.
--

In conclusion, we showed that DATS suppresses the metastasis of the MDA-MB-231 and HS 578T breast cancer cell lines. We suggest that the anti-tumor properties of DATS may beneficial for the inhibition of metastasis by down-regulating the activities and expression of ERK/NF-κB /MMP-2/MMP-9. Garlic can be taken in large quantities in the human diet (2–10 g/day). Considering garlic has one to three percent of DATS and its derivatives,in our research, the concentration of DATS (i.e., 10 μM) should be achieved _in vivo_ and be helpful for preventing or treating breast cancer.

--

In conclusion, the toxicity might be explained by the pro-oxidative activity of components within the extract against proteins and/or DNA but it is not related to caspase 3-dependent apoptosis within cells.

In conclusion, our study showed that heat processing significantly reduced the concentration of phytochemicals and antioxidant parameters in green and red cultivars of curly kale and that the processing affected the two kale cultivars differently, with a greater loss of health-related phytochemicals in the green cultivar compared to the red kale cultivar. Furthermore, both green and red curly kale cultivars inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in colon cancer cells. Interestingly, the fresh curly kale extracts had a higher antiproliferative effect than the extracts from processed curly kale. To summarize, this study provides preliminary data about the ability of curly kale extracts to inhibit growth and induce apoptosis of different colon cancer cells in vitro. Further studies are required to clarify the link between results obtained in cell culture studies and the impact on human health before it can be determined that curly kale intake can affect colon cancer.

In conclusion, we found that ingested microbes impact the systemic immune system at the whole organism level and serve to counteract a genetic predisposition to cancer, even within the tumor micro-environment. Beneficial microbes may ultimately offer tractable population-based approaches to target cancer.

In conclusion, our results suggest that the combination of dietary bioactive supplements GTPs and SFN could enhance the possible novel treatment strategy for hormonal refractory breast tumors. Further, epigenetic regulation of ERα re-activation by combination of GTPs and SFN could help in designing novel therapeutic strategies. However, further studies with _in vivo_ transgenic models such as C3(1)/SV40 and Her2/neu are necessary to validate our observations during different stages of breast cancer progression. These _in vivo_ mouse models can produce ER-negative breast tumors which closely resemble the development, progression and morphology of human breast tumors [35], [36]. These _in vivo_ models can be manipulated to use for ER-reactivation studies by potential bioactive dietary supplements with more close resemblance to humans for the treatment of hormonal refractory breast cancer in combination with available SERMs.

--

In conclusion, these results confirm that the methodology proposed is a simple, selective, and a suitable alternative for obtaining both fucans and organic fractions from same plant material. The versatility and assurance to fully utilize biomass to screening and biological testing of organic extracts and fucans must be studied in detail in order to optimize the recovery of other useful products (alginates and/or solid residues) for possible application. Therefore, further studies are needed in order to evaluate the possibility of using up to 100 % of the biomass available of these or other abundant brown seaweeds in tropical coastal areas. Additionally, we propose a bio-guided isolation of the compounds responsible for the biological activity present, with the purpose of being used as pharmaceutical entities or for the standardization of herbal medicines.

In conclusion, our findings suggest that the inhibitory potential of blueberry extract against carbohydrate-hydrolyzing enzymes is shown to be attributed to low-molecular weight phenolics rather than PACs. Specifically phenolic acids and anthocyanins present in blueberries are considered to contribute to the bioactivity. Finally, we observed that blueberry extracts have shown higher inhibitory activity on sucrase, with much less on maltase. Our current findings provide a sound rationale for further fractionation, characterization, and evaluation of the low-molecular weight phenolic compounds present in blueberries, which will assist in better understanding the potential of blueberry bioactives for type 2 diabetes prevention. The ultimate goal of this work will be the development of the appropriate extraction and standardization procedures for the manufacture of a blueberry extract for type 2 diabetes prevention, to be used either in dietary supplements or food products.

In conclusion, AtNRAMP3 is able to transport both Fe and Cd ions, which means that its function consists in iron absorption under presence of Cd, which inhibits other Fe transporters (Thomine et al. 2000). _A. thaliana_ genome contains ten _AtPCR_ (plant cadmium resistance) genes, which are connected with cadmium resistance. _AtPCR1_ and _AtPCR2_ expression is induced by Cd exposition. Their expression is not connected with GSH. This fact has been verified by BSO application (Song et al. 2004).

In conclusion, this is the first study to standardize and characterize CP, using chrysin as the major index compound. Data suggest that chrysin has HDAC8i properties and is capable of disrupting chromatin remodeling in MDA-MB-231 cells to inhibit cancer cell proliferation. Orally administered chrysin potently inhibits tumor growth in mice. The mechanism by which chrysin exerts anticancer or antitumor activities might be the inhibition of HDAC8 enzymatic activity.

--

In conclusion, our meta-analysis suggests that coffee consumption is not related to overall risk of breast cancer. However, our data suggest that high coffee consumption may decrease risk of ER–negative breast cancer, but these findings may be due to chance and warrant further study.

--

In conclusion, we found no evidence that coffee consumption increases the overall risk of postmenopausal breast cancer. However, a high daily intake of coffee was found to be associated with a significant decrease in ER-negative breast cancer among postmenopausal women. Future studies are needed to confirm the effects of coffee consumption in the light of breast cancer subtypes.

--

In conclusion, the curcurbitacins have been shown to affect multiple cellular pathways and exhibit potent inhibitory activity against many cancer cell lines. Here we report the antiproliferative activity of cucurbitacin D and 3-_epi_-isocucurbitacin D is partly attributed to disruption of Hsp90 client protein maturation and cucurbitacin D destabilizes components of the Hsp90 heteroprotein complex, ultimately resulting in client degradation.

--

In conclusion, our study on the 12 cucurbitacins found that CuE was the most potent cytotoxic compound among five active compounds that were shown to exert anti-cancer effects on several different cancer cell lines. CuE decreased cell viability in multiple TNBC cell lines and also induced G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in MDA-MB-468 and SW527 TNBC cell lines. The mechanism by which CuE inhibits TNBC may potentially be caused by down-regulation of Cyclin D1, Survivin, XIAP, Bcl2, and Mcl-1, the inactivation of STAT3, AKT and ERK, and the activation of JNK. Given the possibilities underpinning these different results, there are many potential mechanisms or effects of CuE and the other active compounds we tested that must be examined further. Such investigations may yield new avenues in the development of novel cancer treatments. However, our findings strongly support CuE as one of the most promising target for further investigation and development of novel therapeutics, especially towards TNBC.

In conclusion, the results from this meta-analysis suggested that greater edible mushroom consumption may be associated with a lower risk of breast cancer. Our research provided a perspective that oral administration of mushrooms perhaps contribute to breast cancer primary prevention. Whereas available data are still sparse, the findings need to be updated and confirmed with well-designed prospective studies in future.

--

In conclusion, we found a trend toward increased breast cancer risk with increasing dietary ratio of total n-6 PUFA to marine-derived n-3 PUFAs. The relative amounts of n-6 PUFA to marine-derived n-3 PUFAs may influence breast cancer risk, with low intake of marine-derived n-3 PUFAs associated with an increased risk for breast cancer in the setting of high n-6 PUFA intake.

--

In conclusion, KRT1 is involved in the anti‑invasive activity of DHA in breast cancer cells.
--

In conclusion, DHA significantly inhibits VEGF-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and eNOS and cell migration via binding to GPR120 and induction of PP2A enzyme activity in HUVECs. Treatment with the NO donor SNAP reverses the DHA inhibition of VEGF-induced cell migration. Taken together, these results support an opposing role of DHA in cell migration, which is implicated in its anticancer and anti-wound-repair properties.

--

In conclusion, using a clonogenic assay, we have shown that berry extracts and compounds can increase the cell-death response of ICI-sensitive breast cancer lines to a sublethal dose of ICI (1 nM, &lt;IC50 dose). Further, we also show that this response is largely additive rather than synergistic. Additionally, berry extracts resensitize ICI-resistant cells to ICI treatment showing a synergistic response, especially at the higher dose (1 _μ_M). Finally, we found that extracts were more effective at lower, physiologically relevant doses than at higher experimental doses in some cell lines. These results indicate that berry extracts and compounds can potentially interact with ICI in breast epithelial cells to alter drug-response. Further _in vivo_ research is warranted regarding the implications of such food-drug interactions in response to ICI treatment and the development of drug resistance.

--

In conclusion, our data suggest that Class I HDACs and EZH2 play important roles in regulating TIMP-3 expression in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231. Elevated levels of transcriptionally repressive H3K27me3 and decreased active H3K9/18 Ac at the TIMP-3 promoter may contribute its repression independent of promoter DNA methylation in these cells.

In conclusion, we found that dietary intake was associated with breast cancer risk among Chinese women. In general, a plant-based diet was inversely related to breast cancer risk and a meat-based diet was associated with increased risk. The dietary associations we found did not vary significantly by ER/PR status, suggesting that the association between diet and breast cancer may be mediated through other mechanisms in addition to those related to estrogen.

--

In conclusion, with the continuing need for novel drug-like leading compounds against the breast cancer, the remarkable anticancer activity of the studied gingerol derivatives compared with the standard therapeutic regimen makes them potential leads for future antibreast cancer agents.

--

In conclusion, this study showed that GSE may differently affect different metastatic pathways, depending on the GSE concentration. High GSE concentration triggered proliferation arrest and apoptosis; on the contrary, low GSE concentration failed to induce growth inhibition or cell death, otherwise influencing migration and invasion processes.

In conclusion, which is the exact hepatotoxic agent in Saba Appetite Control and Energy (ACE) and whether a possible contamination with DMAA played a role in liver toxicity remain unclear.

--

In conclusion, CADPE represented a superior dose- and time-dependent cytotoxicity in high metastatic breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435. It can inhibit the growth of these cells in dose and time-dependent manner through inducing nucleus fragmentation, upregulating the ROS level and the expression of apoptosis precursor protein Bax, downregulating anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 expression, increasing the ratio of Bax and Bcl-2, decreasing mitochondrial membrane potential, triggering the caspase-3 cascade and inducing cell apoptosis of these breast cancer cells. Thus, results in the study suggest that CADPE could be utilized as a cancer treatment against breast cancer. This experiment provided a certain reference value for application of CADPE in the treatment of high metastatic breast cancer.

--

In conclusion, we identified luteolin, distributed widely in consumed fruits and vegetables, as a potent inhibitor of estrogen biosynthesis in human ovarian granulosa-like KGN cells by decreasing aromatase expression and promoting its degradation. We also showed that other daily consumed flavonoids, including isorhamnetin, quercetin, kaempferol, and myricetin, inhibited estrogen biosynthesis with differing potencies. Two widely consumed vegetables, onion and bird chili, also differed in their ability to inhibit estrogen biosynthesis in KGN cells and in aromatase-expressing HEK293A cells. The present study suggests that luteolin may exert its estrogen biosynthesis inhibitory effect through suppression of aromatase expression and promotion of aromatase degradation, and it warrants further investigation as a potential agent for the treatment of breast cancer. Consumption of fruits and vegetables rich in flavonoids will be helpful for reducing endogenous estrogen levels in the prevention of estrogen-dependent disease, such as breast cancer.

--

In conclusion, Fx and Fxol effectively induced cell viability reduction and apoptotic cell death of breast cancer cells. Thus, dietary Fx or Fxol could be potentially effective for the treatment and/or prevention of different types of cancers, including breast cancer. Indeed, most dietary Fx may be converted to Fxol, and Fxol may exert a suppressive effect on cancer cells more efficiently than Fx in vivo. However, although there is a correlation between increased apoptosis and decreased nuclear accumulations of p65, RelB, p50, and p52 in MDA-MB-231 cells, more research will be required to clearly establish a regulatory action of Fxol on members of NF-κB to activate apoptosis.

In conclusion, we observed that treatment with the low concentration of DIM induced breast cancer cell proliferation in the absence of E2, an effect mediated by ERα and the PKA signaling pathway.

--

In conclusion, luteolin effectively suppresses MDA-MB-231 ER-negative breast cancer cell growth, and its anticancer activity may be partly derived from inhibitory effects on EGFR-mediated cell survival.

In conclusion, our data based on fatty acids levels in breast adipose tissue suggest a protective effect of n-3 fatty acids on breast cancer risk and support the hypothesis that the balance between n-3 and n-6 fatty acids plays a role in breast cancer. (C) 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

--

In conclusion, our data based on fatty acid levels in breast adipose tissue suggest a protective effect of n-3 PUFA, somewhat moderate for alpha-linolenic acid, on breast cancer risk and support the hypothesis that the balance between n-3 and n-6 fatty acids plays a role in breast cancer. Further epidemiological and experimental studies are needed to evaluate the potential role of the interaction of n-3 fatty acids with anti- and pro-oxidative vitamins and n-6 PUFA in the development of breast cancer.

--

In conclusion, our findings demonstrated that OA induces MMP-9 secretion through a PKC, Src and EGFR-dependent pathway, whereas it induces invasion via an EGFR, Gi/Go proteins, MMPs, PKC and Src-dependent pathway in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. These findings strongly suggest that OA may have an important role in the invasion process and metastasis in breast cancer.

--

In conclusion, our study shows that olive oil intake during adult life does not reduce the risk of overall BC; however, it suggests a potentially beneficial effect in hormone receptor-negative tumors. Further prospective studies need to confirm these findings and to further investigate the role of virgin and extravirgin olive oil in reducing BC risk, as well as possible differences related to hormone receptor status.

In conclusion, higher consumption of red meat during adolescence was associated with premenopausal breast cancer. Substituting other dietary protein sources for red meat in adolescent diet may decrease premenopausal breast cancer risk.

--

In conclusion, we found that higher consumption of red meat during adolescence was associated with elevated rates of premenopausal breast cancer, but not postmenopausal breast cancer. In addition, poultry intake was associated with a lower risk of breast cancer overall. Replacement of red meat with combination of poultry, fish, legumes and nuts in adolescence may help to reduce the breast cancer risk, especially during the premenopausal years. As the data on diet and breast cancer during childhood remain limited, further investigation is needed to better understand the impact of timing of dietary exposures and cancer risk.

--

In conclusion, it would appear that berry extracts retain their biological activity after digestion and fermentation despite considerable structural modification and this strongly suggests that breakdown products and individual colonic metabolites, including, tyrosol and 4′–hydroxyphenylacetic acid, can modulate cellular processes associated with colon cancer. One can envisage that depending on their position in the colon, epithelial cells are likely to be exposed to varying concentrations of a mixture of phenolic components that have survived digestion in the upper gastrointestinal tract and their fermentation products and this study suggests that both sets of phenolic components can beneficially influence events relevant to the development of colon cancer.

In conclusion, Greek honeys are rich in phenolic acids, in particular protocatechuic and p-hydroxybenzoic acid and exhibit significant antioxidant, anticancer and antiatherogenic activities which may be attributed, at least in part, to their phenolic acid content.

--

In conclusion, our findings suggest that Greek honeys are particularly rich in phenolic acids and exhibit significant antioxidant, anticancer and antiatherogenic activity. Greek conifer tree honeys are a rich source of protocatechuic and caffeic acid, implicating their beneficial use in patients with diabetes mellitus.

--

In conclusion, as summarized in Figure 6, piperine inhibits platelet aggregation by inhibiting cPLA2 and TXA2 activities but does not affect COX-1. In contrast, piperine inhibits macrophage inflammatory response by inhibiting COX-2 activity without effects on cPLA2. This demonstrates that piperine inhibits both platelet aggregation and macrophage inflammatory response via regulation of the AA-metabolizing pathways, but by different inhibitory effects on the metabolic enzymes. Further studies are warranted to determine the exact mechanism of inhibition of the activities of AA-metabolizing enzymes of piperine, and to investigate how it can be used in anti-thrombotic and anti-inflammatory therapies.

--

In conclusion, those data suggest that PG may be used as an innovative alternative agent for the prevention of osteoporosis. However, further studies are now required to determine the detailed contribution of each nutrients, composing PG in mediating the observed bone-sparing effect, and to assess if those data, obtained in an animal model for the disease, can be extrapolated to the postmenopausal women. Nevertheless, further studies are required to fully determine the contribution of each PG parts properties on bone.

--

In conclusion, our findings suggest that coffee consumption and caffeine intake is negatively associated with the risk of breast cancer overall and ER+/PR− breast cancer, respectively, and tea consumption may be positively associated with risk of breast cancer overall and ER+/PR+ breast cancer. Our findings provide additional evidence to support the role of coffee in cancer prevention. More detailed mechanism studies are needed to verify the effects of coffee/tea/caffeine in breast cancer. The roles and mechanisms of coffee/tea/caffeine in breast cancers with different hormone receptor statuses need to be examined in future studies.

In conclusion our studies suggest that the quercetin inhibits the increased migration ability of TNBC. Quercetin is able to regulate EMT markers such as E-cadherin and vimentin in aggressive TNBC cells. Furthermore, quercetin is effective in regulating active β-catenin signaling. Also, the quercetin is capable of inhibiting TGF-β1 induced by higher concentration of doxorubicin. Further studies will be needed to learn more about whether the combination treatment of quercetin and doxorubicin would be a beneficial treatment for TNBC. Studies will also be planned to develop different quercetin analogues to enhance its bioavailability and the biological activity of these derivatives will be compared with parent molecule.

--

In conclusion, extensive data from many studies are available on the concentrations of bioaccumulative contaminants, including PCBs and DDE, both in Great Lakes fish and in Great Lakes fish consumers. In contrast, studies on Great Lakes fish consumers that include concurrent measures of omega-3 fatty acids, chemical contaminants, and health end points are lacking. Such studies would provide the strongest data to address the question as to whether the benefits of Great Lakes fish consumption outweigh the risks posed by ingestion of contaminants in the fish.

--

In conclusion, given the safety level of schizophyllan and its relative low cost, as well as its ability to inhibit mammary carcinomas similar to tamoxifen, and to suppress liver lesions associated with tamoxifen treatment, the present study provides the rationale for the use of schizophyllan in combination with tamoxifen in preclinical models and probably in clinical trials for oestrogen receptor-positive breast cancer therapy. The potential therapeutic value and mechanism of action of SCH deserve further investigation into other types of cancer including liver cancer.

In conclusion, we observed that selenium intake before breast cancer diagnosis may improve breast cancer–specific survival and overall survival. These findings may be limited to populations with low intakes of selenium.

--

In conclusion, our data indicate that sulforaphane or erucin, used at relatively low concentrations, potentiate anticancer activity of 4-hydroxytamoxifen. This effect is mediated by downregulation of anti-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2 and survivin and in consequence by induction of cell death. This strategy allows for using tamoxifen at lower doses, hence decreasing the level of its toxicity and improving the risk–benefit profile of this agent. Moreover, it might protect against acquisition by cancer cells the drug-resistant phenotypes during therapy.

--

In conclusion, results of our study suggest that high enterolactone levels are inversely associated with postmenopausal breast cancer risk in this Western population. The inverse association was stronger for ER−/PR− than for ER+/PR+ tumors, but did not appear to be different from further stratification according to expression of HER2. These findings may have important health implications for women in Western populations with very low phytoestrogen consumption. Further prospective studies in large populations with large range in intake levels of lignans are needed to define the association between circulating enterolactone levels and the subsequent risk of breast cancer according to menopausal status and ER/PR status of the tumor.

In conclusion, silibinin induces cell death through an AIF-dependent mechanism in MCF7 cells and a caspase-3–dependent mechanism in MDA-MB-231 cells, and ROS generation and Notch-1 signaling act upstream of the ERK and Akt pathway. These data suggest that silibinin may serve as a potential agent for induction of apoptosis in human breast cancer cells.

Food Sci. Biotechnol. 24(1): 347-351 (2015) DOI 10.1007/s10068-015-0046-7 RESEARCH NOTE Sulforaphane Inhibited Tumor Necrosis Factor-α Induced Migration and Invasion in Estrogen Receptor Negative Human Breast Cancer Cells Cheng Bao, Jiwon Ko, Hyun-Chang Park, Min Chae Kim, Jongkee Kim, Joong-Hyuck Auh, and Hong Jin Lee Received May 11, 2014; revised August 17, 2014; accepted September 1, 2014; published online February 28, 2015 © KoSFoST and Springer 2015 Abstract Sulforaphane significantly (p&lt;0.05) inhibited tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α induced cellular migration and invasion in MCF10DCIS.com human breast cancer cells, compared with controls. mRNA and protein expressions of MMPs, including MMP-2, MMP-9, and MMP-13, and the enzymatic activities of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were suppressed by sulforaphane treatments at 1, 5, and 10 µM concentration in MCF10DCIS.com cells. Sulforaphane should be considered as a potent agent for retardation of mammary tumorigenesis. Keywords: breast cancer, invasion, matrix metallo- proteinase, migration, sulforaphane Introduction Epidemiological studies have demonstrated that consumption of the cruciferous vegetables cabbage, cauliflower, and broccoli is associated with a reduced risk of cancers, including breast, lung, and pancreatic cancer (1). The protective effects of these cruciferous vegetables against cancer are thought to be derived from isothiocyanates (ITCs), the hydrolysis products of glucosinolates (2). Sulforaphane (1-isothiocyanate-4-methyl-sulfonylbutane) (Fig. 1A) is a major ITC present in broccoli and other cruciferous vegetables that has displayed anti-cancer properties against different cancer cell lines (3-6). Sulforaphane arrested cell cycle progression, induced apoptosis and autophagy in different prostate cancer cells, inhibited in vivo xenograft tumor growth of PC-3 human prostate cancer (3,4), and regulated cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in colon cancer cells (5). In breast cancer, it was recently reported that sulforaphane suppressed cellular invasion of MCF-7 estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer cells via inhibition of the NF-κB signaling pathway and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 expression (6). In addition, sulforaphane exerted suppressive activity against MMP-7 and -14 mRNA without affecting MMP-1, -3, and -9 in ER-negative MDA-MB-231 cells (7). However, the effect of sulforaphane on MMPs resulting in cellular migration and invasion in ER-negative breast cancer has not been clearly elucidated. Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer worldwide and is one of the leading causes of death in women (8). Despite successful treatment of primary malignancies, relapse and subsequent metastatic spread still occur through the bloodstream and lymphatic systems, which leads to metastasis to other organs, such as bones and lungs (9). This process requires degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in which matrix MMPs play critical roles. Elevated MMP-9 levels were reported to be linked with a higher degree of metastasis in many tumors (10), and MMP-9 deficient mice exhibited suppression of metastasis (11). Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) has been suggested as a pro-inflammatory cytokine that plays an important role in tumor invasion and metastasis (12). TNF-α induced cellular migration and invasion via enhancement of MMPs expression and enzymatic activity in breast cancer cells (13). In this study, the role of sulforaphane in modulation Cheng Bao, Jiwon Ko, Hyun-Chang Park, Min Chae Kim, Joong-Hyuck Auh, Hong Jin Lee ( ) Department of Food Science and Technology, Chung-Ang University, Anseong, Gyeonggi 456-756, Korea Tel: +82-31-670-3030; Fax: +82-31-675-4853 E-mail: hongjin@cau.ac.kr Jongkee Kim Department of Integrative Plant Science, Chung-Ang University, Anseong, Gyeonggi 456-756, Korea 348 Bao et al. of TNF-α induced migration and invasion of MCF10DCIS.com human breast cancer cells was investigated. Materials and Methods Reagents and cell culture Sulforaphane was purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA) and TNF-α was obtained from R&amp;D Systems (Minneapolis, MN, USA). MCF10DCIS.com human breast cancer cells were purchased from Asterand (Detroit, MI, USA) and cultured in DMEM/F12 (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA) supplemented with 5% horse serum, 1% HEPES, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies) at 37 oC and 5% CO 2. Cell proliferation assay MCF10DCIS.com cells were seeded (5,000 cells/well) in a 96-well plate overnight and treated with sulforaphane or TNF-α together with sulfora- phane at different concentrations for 24 h. A MTT (20 µL; Sigma) was added to each well 4 h before harvest. The supernatant was removed and the dark blue formazan crystals formed in intact cells were dissolved using dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), then the absorbance was measured at 570 nm using a microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Cell proliferation was described as a percentage of cell viability, compared to controls. RNA extraction and quantitative real-time PCR Total cellular RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies) and reverse-transcribed into cDNA using a RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo, Vilnius, Lithuania). cDNA was amplified using 5× HOT FIREPol EvaGreen qPCR mix Plus (Solis Biodyne, Tartu, Estonia). Using pre-designed Taqman primers, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was carried out using the ABI PRISM 7900 sequence detection system (Life Technologies). GAPDH was used as an internal control. Western blot analysis Western blot analysis was performed as described previously (13). Briefly, cell lysates were separated and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes (Milipore, Billerica, MA, USA). Primary antibodies against MMP-2, MMP-13, (Millipore), and MMP-9 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) and the secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used. The amount of protein was quantified using EZ capture MG and EZ west Lumi plus (ATTO, Tokyo, Japan). Wound-healing migration assay Wounds with a constant diameter were made using sterile tips, and cells were treated with different concentrations of TNF-α and sulforaphane. The wound area was analyzed and quantified using Image Pro-plus 6.0 software (Media Cybernetics, Rockville, MD, USA). The percentage of wound area was calculated by division of the non-recovered area at 24 h by the initial wound area at 0 h. Invasion assay Following manufacturer instructions, an invasion assay was performed using a BD Matrigel invasion chamber (BD Biosciences, Bedford, MA, USA). Briefly, a cell suspension (5×10 4) was inoculated into culture inserts and treated with different concentrations of TNF-α and sulforaphane. After incubation for 24 h, cells on the transwell plate were removed by scraping with cotton swab and the lower surface of the membrane was fixed using 100% methanol and stained using hematoxylin- eosin (Sigma). Invading cells were quantified under a microscope based on counts of cells from randomly selected fields (5 fields/treatment). Gelatin zymography assay The culture medium after 24 h treatment was loaded and separated by electrophoresis using a polyacrylamide gel containing 0.1% (w/v) gelatin. The gel was washed with 2.5% Triton X-100 to remove SDS, rinsed with a 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.6) containing 5 mM CaCl 2, 200 mM NaCl, and 0.02% Brij-35 (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), then incubated overnight at 37 oC. The following day, the gel was stained with a 0.5% Coomassie brilliant blue R-250 solution (Amresco, Solon, OH, USA) containing 10% acetic acid and 20% methanol for 30 min, then destained using a 7.5% acetic acid solution containing 10% methanol. The gelatinase activity was determined using EZ West Lumi plus (ATTO). Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was performed using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) with SPSS (version 21; IBM, New York, NY, USA). Data were presented as mean±standard deviation (SD). Significance was determined when p value is lower than 0.05.

In conclusion, our study demonstrates that combination of apigenin and paclitaxel possesses a more apparent anti-cancer activity _in vitro_ compared with each of them alone. Mechanically, apigenin suppresses the activity of SOD to lead cancer cells sensitive to cytotoxity of paclitaxel. Furthermore, ROS-induced activation of caspase-2 and depolarization of MMP participate in apigenin and paclitaxel induced cancer cell apoptosis. Therefore, this study indicates the synergistic anti-cancer effects of apigenin and paclitaxel in tumor chemotherapy.

In conclusion, the present study provides some evidence for a reduced postmenopausal breast cancer risk when consuming a diet rich in sunflower or pumpkin seeds and soybeans. However, not many studies investigated the association between soy foods and postmenopausal breast cancer risk in a Western population. Further studies using biomarkers of phytoestrogen intake will contribute to a better understanding of this subject. Large epidemiological studies are warranted to elucidate the association of the different classes of phytoestrogens with postmenopausal breast cancer risk, as well as experimental studies to unravel the underlying mechanisms.

In conclusion, kaempferol potently inhibits glucose uptake by MCF-7 cells, apparently by decreasing GLUT1-mediated glucose uptake. The antiproliferative and cytotoxic effect of kaempferol in these cells appears to be dependent on this effect.

In conclusion, our results show that a single application of α-tomatine has an antiproliferative effect on cancer cells within 24 h of incubation, but then the cells recover. Since α-tomatine is not biotransformed in the MCF-7 cell line via deglycosidation or oxidation during 72 h but the concentration of α-tomatine significantly decreases in solutions and media containing cholesterol, this effect is most probably related to the ability of α-tomatine to bind with cholesterol present in the culture medium. Our study is the first to describe this phenomenon, which should be taken into consideration when interpreting results from an in vitro assay with α-tomatine. α-Tomatine does not induce DNA damage or the activation of caspases; it does not change the levels of proteins p53 and p21 in the MCF-7 cell line but rather causes a decrease in the cellular ATP. These facts, along with the morphological changes observed, suggest that the decrease in viability of MCF-7 cells by α-tomatine is not due to apoptosis induction. A probable mechanism involved in the cytotoxicity is the membrane-disruptive effect due to its binding with membrane cholesterol.

In conclusion, the chemically characterized dietary mushroom extract GLE inhibits breast-to-lung cancer metastasis of highly invasive human breast cancer cells implanted in mouse mammary tissue. In addition, GLE suppresses the expression of genes involved in the invasive behavior of cancer cells. Further preclinical studies evaluating GLE activity in the prevention of breast cancer metastasis are warranted.

In conclusion, the results of this study indicate that high overall dietary antioxidant capacity is associated with a decreased risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal women. Individual antioxidants are not associated with overall breast cancer risk emphasizing the need of appraising antioxidant dietary levels and contribution as a whole rather than evaluating individual effects. Additional studies are needed to gain further insight into the influence of antioxidant capacity and dietary antioxidants and the risk of breast cancer in specific subgroups such as smokers and elderly aged 70 years and older.

In conclusion, consumption of vegetable protein, fat, peanut butter, or nuts by older girls may help reduce their risk of BBD as young women.

--

In conclusion, we assessed BBD risk in young women (in their 20s) in relation to their vegetable protein and vegetable fat intakes recorded during pre-adolescence and adolescence, periods previously demonstrated to be critical for the development of breast cancer [2–5] and other adult diseases. We found evidence that vegetable protein and fat intakes, and peanut butter and nuts in particular, may help reduce risk for BBD. Older girls may benefit by consuming a variety of foods that are high in vegetable protein and fat, including peanut butter, nuts, corn, beans, lentils, and soybeans. Because our number of cases was relatively small, and because certain dietary factors may require longer latency from exposure to development of disease, continued follow-up of this cohort will be critical to reassess these results as new cases of BBD are diagnosed. In addition, animal models may help refine understanding of pathways and mechanisms, and potential prevention strategies.

In conclusion, we found no clear associations between intake of different carbohydrates, total carbohydrate intake, glycemic index, or glycemic load and breast cancer incidence in postmenopausal women. Furthermore, when ER+ and ER− breast cancer cases were analyzed separately, no clear associations were observed.

In conclusion, our findings suggest that coffee consumption and caffeine intake is negatively associated with the risk of breast cancer overall and ER+/PR− breast cancer, respectively, and tea consumption may be positively associated with risk of breast cancer overall and ER+/PR+ breast cancer. Our findings provide additional evidence to support the role of coffee in cancer prevention. More detailed mechanism studies are needed to verify the effects of coffee/tea/caffeine in breast cancer. The roles and mechanisms of coffee/tea/caffeine in breast cancers with different hormone receptor statuses need to be examined in future studies.
