    Abnormal expression and  activity of many oncogenes and tumor suppressors, such
    as -catenin, C-myc, PTEN, and P53, play critical roles in the development of human
    cancers.1,2 Recent studies suggest that the anticancer ability of several natural
    products may be associated with regulation of these genes.3,4 For instance, metformin,
    which is usually prescribed as an oral antihyperglycemic agent, could reduce risk
    and improve prognosis of certain cancers.5,6 At the molecular level, metformin
    inhibits cancer cell proliferation and migration through repressing the insulin/insulin-like
    growth factor 1  signaling pathway and upregulation of p53 contents.7,8


    Cucurbitacins, which are widely distributed in plants, belong to a class of highly
    oxidized tetracyclic triterpenoids.9 They have attracted much attention for their
    promising anticancer activities, including antiproliferation, cell cycle arrest,
    and induction of apoptosis.10,11 It has been shown that cucurbitacin-B regulates
    immature myeloid cell differentiation and enhances antitumor immunity in patients
    with lung cancer.12 Besides, cucurbitacin-B enhances the radiation sensitivity
    of human breast cancer cells via G2/M cell cycle arrest.13 Moreover, cucurbitacin-D
    increases the proportion in the sub-G0/G1 phases and G2/M phases of the cell cycle,
    resulting in growth inhibition and apoptosis in human endometrial and ovarian
    cancer cells.14
