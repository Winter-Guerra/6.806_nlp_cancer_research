  Pork is a dietary source of iron and selenium. Pork fat has a high saturated fatty
  acid and cholesterol content. Diets high in pork have been linked in population
  studies to higher risks of esophageal, thyroid, lung, pancreatic, liver, bladder,
  colorectal, and prostate cancer, as well as non-Hodgkins lymphoma. In this article,
  we evaluate the potential impact on breast cancer risk of consuming pork products
  that are not salted, smoked or cured. Such pork products are covered under bacon.


  Breast cancer risk has been found to increase with increasing consumption of pork
  in several population studies. In addition, high red meat consumption during adolescence
  has been found to be associated with increased risk of premenopausal breast cancer.
  A small Brazilian study found that breast cancer risk was sharply higher for women
  who regularly consumed lard  and fatty red meat. However, a 2009 Swedish population
  study found no association between fresh red meat intake and overall breast cancer
  risk, while suggesting that fried red meat intake may increase the risk of estrogen
  receptor-positive/progesterone receptor-negative ER+/PR- breast cancer.


  Red meat intake has been shown reduce circulating melatonin. Melatonin protects
  against breast cancer in several ways, including by reducing aromatase activity
  within the breast, thereby reducing estrogen production.


  Relatively high levels of heterocyclic aromatic amines  have been found in pork
  dishes such as pork chops and other pan-fried pork, Chinese-style and Western-style
  roasted pork, pork ribs, and barbecued pork, as well as pork drippings. HCAs have
  been shown be associated with the development of various cancers, including breast
  cancer. Two of the HCAs found in pork cooked using high temperature methods, 2-amino-3-methylimidazopyridine
  and 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazopyridine, have also been shown to have potent
  estrogenic activity, inducing activation of estrogen-regulated genes, proliferation
  of estrogen-dependent cells and up-regulation of progesterone receptor.


  While iron deficiency anemia is a serious condition to be avoided, the contribution
  of significant iron in the diet as a result of regularly consuming pork could be
  detrimental for some women. Pork contains approximately 60 percent of the iron in
  beef. Iron depletion has been shown to lead to significant inhibition of breast
  cancer cell growth in the laboratory. Relatively high levels of iron in benign breast
  tissue was found in one prospective study to be associated with an increase in risk
  of subsequent breast cancer. Other studies have found high levels of iron in the
  blood to be associated with increased breast cancer risk. High intake of saturated
  fat from animal sources including pork has also been found to be associated with
  increased risk of breast cancer.


  Based on the available evidence, pork prepared using high temperature methods, pork
  drippings, charred pork, pork fat, and lard all should be avoided by breast cancer
  patients, survivors and those at high risk for breast cancer. In addition, consumption
  of lean pork dishes prepared using lower temperature methods should be limited.


  Pork should eaten fully cooked, not rare or raw, to minimize the risk of trichinosis
  and listeriosis infections.


  While most U.S. consumers avoid cooking with lard because of its known negative
  health profile, it is used in some processed foods such as baked goods, often in
  hydrogenated form.
