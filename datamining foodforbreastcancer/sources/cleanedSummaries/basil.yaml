  Basil contains numerous volatile compounds and other substances that have powerful
  antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and antifungal properties. Basil
  may help alleviate type 2 diabetes by improving insulin activity in the body. Carnosol,
  a component of basil, has been shown to inhibit carcinogenesis of human prostate
  cancer cells. While the evidence is mixed as to whether basil can retard liver tumor
  formation in experimental mice, it has been shown to inhibit liver cancer metastasis.
  Basil leaf extract has been found to be highly effective in inhibiting carcinogen-induced
  lung tumor incidence in experimental mice. Basil oil and its components have been
  shown to have significant anti-proliferative activity in the mouse leukemia and
  kidney cells. In addition, basil oil has been found to significantly inhibit carcinogen-induced
  squamous cell carcinoma in the stomachs of experimental mice.


  Basil extract has been shown to induce apoptosis  in both hormone receptor positive  and
  triple negative  breast cancer cells. Linalool, a component of basil, has been found
  to increase Adriamycin  induced cytotoxicity and pro-apoptotic effects in chemotherapy-resistant
  breast cancer cell lines.


  While they are closely related, basil, otherwise known as sweet basil, is not exactly
  the same plant as holy basil. Fresh or dried basil typically is used as a food ingredient,
  whereas holy basil normally is consumed as a herb in the U.S. When basil is used
  as a food ingredient, it is safe, but an essential oil from basil might cause cancer
  in extremely large quantities since it contains estragole. Estragole is an organic
  compound that acts as a rodent carcinogen in large doses. The percentage content
  of estragole in basil oil can be significant. Pesto sauce, which has basil as the
  primary ingredient, can also have a significant estragole component. Therefore,
  we recommend against consuming all but small amounts of basil essential oil or pesto.
