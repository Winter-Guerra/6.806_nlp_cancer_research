  Like herring, mackerel is a good source of vitamin D, vitamin B6, coenzyme Q10,
  selenium and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. Generally speaking, the benefits
  of consuming fatty fish are thought to outweigh the potentially detrimental effects
  of the toxins from pollution and other sources that tend to accumulate in their
  adipose tissue. Consumption of fatty fish or fish oil has been found to reduce the
  risk of coronary heart disease. Consumption of dried mackerel was shown in one study
  to improve the learning ability of laboratory mice, apparently by increasing the
  level of the marine omega-3 fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid  in their brains. Eating
  fatty fish such as mackerel has been found to be associated with reduced risks of
  leukemia, multiple myeloma, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, as well as renal cell, endometrial
  and prostate cancer.


  Like other fatty fish, mackerel contains the marine fatty acids DHA and eicosapentaenoic
  acid, which have chemopreventive properties. These marine fatty acids have been
  shown to inhibit proliferation of breast cancer cells in the laboratory. Relatively
  high fatty fish intake has been shown to be associated with reduced risk of breast
  cancer and improved survival. In one experiment, higher omega-3 to omega-6 fatty
  acid diets reduced mammary gland density in mice, which in turn reduced carcinogen-induced
  mammary tumor development. Fish oil has been shown to inhibit early stages of mammary
  tumor development in a mouse model of HER-2/neu overexpressing  breast cancer. DHA
  has been demonstrated to reduce bone metastasis in a mouse model of breast cancer.


  Many epidemiological studies have found convincing evidence of a negative association
  between DHA and EPS intake or fatty fish consumption and the risk of breast cancer,
  although not all are in agreement. One study concluded that higher intakes of fish
  were actually associated with higher incidence rates of ER+ breast cancer for postmenopausal
  women. Several studies have found that higher omega-3 to omega-6 fatty acid ratios
  are associated with reduced risk of breast cancer; consuming mackerel would tend
  to improve the ratio for most women.


  Marine fatty acids have also been found to enhance the therapeutic effects of tamoxifen
  and chemotherapy drugs such as Adriamycin and Taxol. However, note that recent research
  suggests that mackerel and similar fish should not be consumed the day before through
  the day after a chemotherapy treatment and in moderation during the remaining days
  of each cycle. Mackerel contains a fatty acid  that can induce resistance to a broad
  spectrum of chemotherapy drugs.


  Mackerel consumption should be reduced or eliminated by pregnant and nursing mothers
  since toxins from pollution and other sources might reduce birth weight and are
  secreted in breast milk. While mackerel is not generally considered a high mercury
  level fish, king mackerel and other mackerel from the Gulf of Mexico have been found
  to have high levels of mercury and should be avoided.


  We recommend against consuming all but modest amounts of smoked mackerel, dried
  mackerel, salted dried mackerel, or mackerel pt since such preserved fish foods
  have been associated with increased risks of gastric, colorectal and other cancers.


  Pan frying mackerel has been shown to release carcinogenic heterocyclic amines  in
  concentrations high enough to affect human health. Population studies have found
  that consumption of fried fish is associated with increased risk of breast cancer.
