  Artichokes, otherwise known as globe artichokes, are a member of the thistle family.
  Artichokes are a good dietary source of phosphorus, magnesium, iron, niacin, vitamin
  B1 and vitamin B2, and also include some folate, manganese, and zinc. Artichokes
  also contain apigenin, luteolin, silibinin, chlorogenic acid, cynarin, caffeic acid,
  ferulic acid, several anthocyanins, and oligofructose compounds such as inulin,
  most of which have been reported to have anti-cancer properties. Artichokes have
  been shown to have antioxidant, antifungal, antigenotoxic, liver-protective and
  hypoglycemic activities, as well as reducing cholesterol and ameliorating indigestion
  and irritable bowel syndrome.


  Artichoke extract has been shown to inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis  in
  triple negative  breast cancer cells in the laboratory. Flavone components of artichoke  have
  been shown to induce apoptosis across a variety of breast cancer cell lines. Silibinin
  has been shown to induce apoptosis in both triple negative and hormone receptor
  positive  breast cancer cells. Silibinin has also been shown to reduce the degree
  of stem cell-like properties of clusters of triple negative cells. In addition,
  silibinin has been shown to suppress ER+/PR+ breast cancer cell migration.


  An Italian population study found that the risk of breast cancer was reduced for
  increasing intake of apigenin and luteolin, among other flavones. However, no population
  studies have specifically evaluated the impact of consuming artichokes on the risk
  of breast cancer.


  Milk thistle, a herb related to the artichoke, traditionally has been used for its
  liver-protective properties, but increasingly is being used by cancer patients.
  Milk thistle is the best known source of the compound flavonoid silymarin, which
  contains silibinin, silybin, silicristin, silidianin and related compounds. Silibinin
  is the most biologically active component of silymarin. However, silybin has also
  been shown to inhibit growth and induce apoptosis in human breast cancer cells and
  HER2/neu overexpressing mammary tumors in a mouse model. Silymarin has been shown
  to have a synergistic effect with Adriamycin, increasing its treatment effects.


  However, one study found that treatment of human breast cancer tumor grafts in rodents
  with silymarin isolated from milk thistle stimulated tumor growth. Therefore, we
  caution breast cancer patients, survivors and those at high risk against taking
  concentrated milk thistle, artichoke or silymarin supplements.


  Cardoon, also known as artichoke thistle or wild artichoke, is an edible thistle-like
  plant native to the Mediterranean. Jerusalem artichokes  are part of the sunflower
  family and are not related to artichokes.
