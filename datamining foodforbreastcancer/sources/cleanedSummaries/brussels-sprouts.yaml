  Brussels sprouts have been shown to suppress inflammation and can reduce the risk
  of occurrence of multiple myeloma, as well as gallbladder, prostate, lung, ovarian,
  cervical and colorectal cancer.


  Brussels sprouts contain numerous substances with suspected or demonstrated cancer
  fighting properties, including beta-carotene, sulforaphane, indole-3-carbinol, 3,3-diindolylmethane,
  and several other glucosinolates. Brussels sprouts are also a good source of the
  lignan enterolactone. Brussels sprouts have been found to be promote apoptosis,
  suppress cell cycle progression and inhibit angiogenesis of human breast cancer
  cells. Futhermore, brussels sprouts can protect against cell DNA damage. Consumption
  of brassica vegetables has been shown to reduce the estrogen metabolite 16alpha-hydroxyestrone,
  which is a breast cancer promoter, and to be marginally inversely associated with
  breast cancer risk in a population of premenopausal women. Brussels sprouts components
  I3C and sulforaphane have both been shown increase the anti-cancer effects of the
  chemotherapy drug Taxol. The kaempferol in brussels sprouts might help protect against
  the cardiotoxicity of Adriamycin chemotherapy.


  We recommend consuming brussels sprouts and other brassica vegetables as food and
  against consuming broccoli pills that have been enhanced to boost the proportion
  of the presumed key anti-cancer chemicals in these vegetables. There is some evidence
  that concentrated cruciferous vegetable extracts can act as estrogen agonists and
  promote breast cancer cell proliferation. Also, the anticancer properties of broccoli
  are likely to be the result of synergistic interaction of its various chemical components
  - isolated components have successfully inhibited proliferation in the laboratory,
  but their efficacy and safety in humans needs to be evaluated in large scale clinical
  trials.


  Cruciferous vegetables contain thioglucoside compounds that can interfere with the
  formation of thyroid hormone.
