  Yogurt, or yoghurt, is made by adding bacterial cultures to milk, which ferments
  it. Fermentation of lactose  converts it into lactic acid, which gives yogurt its
  slightly sour taste. Yogurt is a good dietary source of calcium, phosphorus, iodine,
  vitamin B2, and vitamin B12. Consumption of yogurt has been shown to improve cholesterol
  profile. Intake of yogurt has been found to be associated with lower risks of colorectal
  and bladder cancer. On the other hand, some  studies have reported that yogurt consumption
  is associated with an increased risk of kidney cancer and squamous cell skin cancer.


  Yogurt is a good source of conjugated linoleic acid, which has been shown to inhibit
  the growth and migration of breast cancer cells. Case-control studies conducted
  in France and Uruguay have found that yogurt consumption is associated with a reduction
  in the risk of breast cancer.


  While yogurt appears to have some ability to protect against breast cancer, kefir  has
  been shown to have stronger effects at lower concentrations. Kefir is made using
  kefir grains, which consist of a complex living culture of yeasts and bacteria,
  whereas yogurt typically is made using only lactobacillus strains.


  Yogurt with added probiotics  is designed to improve intestinal functioning. Probiotics
  appear to act by reinforcing the intestinal mucosal barrier against deleterious
  agents. Other health claims have also been made for probiotic yogurt, however one
  study found that probiotic yogurt did not perform better than regular yogurt in
  stimulating cellular immune functions.


  Organic yogurt is preferable to non-organic yogurt because the milk used to produce
  it contains fewer hormones. Many flavored yogurts contain substantial amounts of
  sugar. Plain yogurt can be used successfully in many recipes that call for sour
  cream, milk or melted butter.
