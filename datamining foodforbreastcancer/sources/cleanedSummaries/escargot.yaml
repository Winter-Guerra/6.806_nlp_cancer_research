  Escargot  are land snails usually served as an appetizer. Escargot are a good source
  of protein, while having a low fat content, mostly consisting of unsaturated fatty
  acids, including alpha-linolenic acid and linoleic acid, which are present in proportions
  that depend on the snails diets. Obviously, escargot is a low saturated-fat food
  only if cooked and eaten without butter.


  The interest in escargot snails derives in part from its unique lectin, Helix pomatia
  agglutinin, that is used as a prognostic indicator for some cancers, including breast
  cancer. Lectins, a group of glycoproteins found in animal as well as plant cells,
  are used as differentiating markers to study cancers and metastatic cell lines.
  Changes in glycosylation of cell membranes play an important role in the metastatic
  behavior of tumor cells. Carbohydrate residues of the membrane glycoproteins can
  be detected using certain lectins due to the fact that the lectins bind specifically
  to these carbohydrates. HPA recognizes -D-N-acetylgalactosamine-containing epitopes  which
  are only present in cancer cell lines having a high likelihood to undergo metastasis.
  HPA fixation on histological preparations of breast cancer tissues is associated
  with an ominous prognosis. A 2015 study reported that HPA itself has the potential
  to promote breast cancer metastasis through increased vascular invasion and lymph
  node involvement.


  A different lectin from the giant African land snail  has been found to cause apoptosis  in
  human breast cancer cells. However, evidence concerning the giant African land snail
  and the fact that a component of escargot snails binds specifically to aggressive
  breast cancer cells does not mean that consuming escargot will help prevent breast
  cancer. No population studies have been performed to test the hypothesis that consuming
  escargot is associated with reduced breast cancer risk.


  Commercially farm-raised escargot snails typically are fed a diet of ground cereals,
  which results in a less favorable fatty acid profile than that of free range snails.
  Farm-raised snails are also said to be more rubbery and tasteless than snails that
  have been allowed to roam over a patch of grass and vegetables. However, since free
  range snails consume a variety of decayed matter, dead animals and insects, and
  a wide variety of leaves, their stomach contents can be harmful to humans and their
  digestive systems must be purged of such contents before cooking. Poisoning by snails
  that had consumed oleander leaves has been reported.


  Snails have been found to accumulate cadmium in their tissues from soil containing
  cadmium. Snails can also become contaminated with cadmium and other carcinogens
  by roadside car exhaust fumes. Cases of meningitis have been reported caused by
  people eating garden snails. Although customary in some areas of Europe, it appears
  unwise for inexperienced consumers to collect and consume garden snails or snails
  found in other natural settings. In addition, snails must not be eaten raw; there
  have been reports of parasitic infections resulting from consumption of raw snail
  meat. French restaurants and specialty stores typically are the best sources of
  escargot. Consumers preparing their own escargot or other snails should be aware
  of their source and assure themselves of their freshness and safety.


  Escargot are considered good protection against breast cancer for individuals with
  type A or type AB blood type by some alternative health practitioners. This theory
  appears to be based in part on the fact that the escargot lectin will recognize
  blood group A antigen. The assumption is that HPA can expose the cancerous cells,
  thereby making them more available and susceptible to attack by antibodies of the
  blood type. However, we have not found any scientific studies that support this
  theory.


  Note that while we are continually searching for new evidence specifically concerning
  this food, there is not much interest in it among breast cancer researchers, so
  few studies are available.
