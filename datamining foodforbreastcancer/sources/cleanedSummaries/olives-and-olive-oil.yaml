  Olive oil is a mostly unsaturated oil consisting primarily of oleic acid, linoleic
  acid, palmitic acid, and stearic acid. In addition, olive oil is a major source
  phytochemicals and also contains some melatonin. Olive oil has been shown to reduce
  oxidative DNA damage and improve coronary heart disease by reducing blood pressure,
  low-density lipoprotein  cholesterol, and inflammation. Olive oil consumption was
  shown to be significantly related to less cognitive decline in one study of 8,028
  French subjects aged 65 years and over, and has been shown to reduce pain and disability
  in those with arthritis.


  Olive extract has been shown to inhibit proliferation and induce cell death of gastric
  cancer, lung cancer, and leukemia cells. Olive oil consumption also has been associated
  with lower risks of colon and ovarian cancer. Oleic acid does not appear to account
  for its anti-cancer effects and in fact might promote breast cancer. While oleic
  acid has anti-inflammatory properties, it has also been shown to induce migration
  and proliferation of both hormone receptor positive  and triple negative breast
  cancer cells. These findings imply that the protective effect of olive oil are due
  to other components of the oil and not the direct effect of oleic acid. The findings
  also argue against using highly refined olive oil.


  Extra-virgin olive oil contains at least 30 phenolic compounds, a diverse group
  of aromatic compounds. Included are some familiar flavonoids  and phenolic acids.
  However, the most important phenolic compounds include the less familiar oleuropein,
  oleocanthal, hydroxytyrosol, and tyrosol. The phenolic compounds present in olive
  oil are strong antioxidants and free radical scavengers and have been shown to have
  anti-cancer effects in breast cancer cells. This again highlights the importance
  of using extra-virgin olive oil  rather than later pressings or more processed and
  refined olive oil, which tend to have less or very little phenolic content.


  A number of studies have found that olive oil consumption  is associated with a
  lower risk of breast cancer. For example, a prospective Swedish study found a lower
  risk of breast cancer for women after 50 with a high intake of monounsaturated fat
  compared to consumption of other types of fat. A study of women in the Canary Islands
  found a lower risk of breast cancer for women in the highest quintile of monounsaturated
  fat consumption and even lower for those consuming mostly olive oil. Italian and
  Greek studies have also found that olive oil consumption is associated with a lower
  risk of breast cancer. A 2011 meta-analysis of data from 19 previous case-control
  studies found that the highest level of olive oil consumption was associated with
  approximately half the risk of developing breast cancer compared with the lowest
  intake level of intake. On the other hand, a large 2012 prospective study among
  women in Spain, Italy and Greece reported that women in the highest third of olive
  oil consumption had essentially the same risk of breast cancer as those in the lowest
  third.


  Numerous studies have found that extra virgin olive oil inhibits proliferation of
  and induces apoptosis of HER2/neu overexpressing  breast cancer cells. These effects
  appear to be due to olive lignans and secoiridoids rather than olive phenols and
  phenolic acids. In fact, some observers have concluded that the protective effect
  of olive oil against breast cancer is mostly confined to the HER2+ breast cancer
  subtype, with no significant influence on the occurrence of HER2- disease.


  Consumption of olive oil reduces the aggressiveness of mammary tumors in animal
  models of breast cancer. One study compared induced tumors in rats that were fed
  high-fat diets  either olive oil or corn oil. The high corn oil diet clearly stimulated
  cancer development, resulting in the earliest appearance of tumors and the highest
  tumor incidence and yield, whereas the high extra-virgin olive oil diet appeared
  to have only a weak enhancing effect, primarily by increasing tumor yield compared
  to control animals fed a low-fat diet.


  Laboratory studies have documented specific olive oil-induced molecular changes
  in cancer cells and tumors, including changes in the composition of cell membranes,
  signaling proteins and gene expression. These changes are likely to result in lower
  proliferation and more apoptosis  of breast cancer cells, as well as enhanced protection
  against DNA damage.


  Extra-virgin olive oil potentiates the effects of aromatase inhibitors in ER+/PR+
  breast cancer cells by increasing programmed cell death. Oleic acid has been shown
  to increase the effect of the chemotherapy drug Taxol  against breast cancer. Olive
  oil has also been shown to increase Herceptins effectiveness in treating HER2+ breast
  cancer and may counteract resistance to Herceptin.


  Consumption of olive oil was associated with lower breast density, a strong breast
  cancer risk factor, in one study. Oleic acid has been shown to increase the bioavailability
  of beta-carotene in the diet, which may help explain why the high raw vegetable/high
  olive oil dietary pattern appears to be protective against breast cancer. Emphasizing
  monounsaturated fats in the diet is thought to have a positive effect on health
  in part because it will help reduce the relative proportions of saturated fats,
  trans fatty acids and omega-6 fatty acids in the diet. Adding extra-virgin olive
  oil to the typical American diet by using it to fry with or to make marinades or
  pasta sauces is unlikely to have as much positive impact on breast cancer risk as
  would using olive oil in salad dressings and to prepare dishes with a high proportion
  of vegetables.
