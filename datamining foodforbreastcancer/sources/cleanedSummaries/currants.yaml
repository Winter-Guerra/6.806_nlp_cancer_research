  Currants are small sour berries that are normally eaten in dried form  in the U.S.
  Black currants, red currents  and white currants  are the most common varieties.
  Currants, which are related to gooseberries, are good sources of vitamin C and fiber.
  Darker varieties are rich sources of anthocyanins, which have been reported to have
  anticancer properties. Currants also contain myricetin and quercetin, ellagic acid,
  and the isoflavone phytoestrogens genistein and daidzein. Currants have been shown
  to have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Currant roots and seeds are
  high in gamma-linolenic acid, which has been traditionally used to treat pre-menstrual
  syndrome and other female health problems.


  Currants share many of the properties of blueberries and cranberries and therefore
  would be expected to have similar chemopreventive effects against breast cancer.
  However, the few population studies that have been undertaken which have included
  currants have not attempted to isolate the effects of this berry.


  Black currant seed oil, evening primrose oil, and borage oil are all marketed as
  sources of GLA. GLA is an omega-6 unsaturated fatty acid with anti-inflammatory
  properties. GLA and its metabolites affect the expression of various genes, including
  ones that play a significant role in immune functions and cell death. Most people
  obtain abundant levels of GLA through their diets  and do not need supplementation.
  Black currant oil, evening primrose oil, and borage oil have numerous biologically
  active components  in addition to GLA and their health-related effects may be the
  result of these other components.


  Consumers should be aware that, like cranberry juice, currant juice may have high
  levels of sugar or other sweeteners.
