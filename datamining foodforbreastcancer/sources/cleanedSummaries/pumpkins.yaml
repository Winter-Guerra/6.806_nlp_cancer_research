  By pumpkins, we mean common large pumpkins, as well as smaller members of the pumpkin
  family with orange or deep yellow flesh such as butternut squash, acorn squash,
  winter squash, spaghetti squash, harlequin squash, Hokkaido pumpkins, red kuri squash,
  and other small orange squashes. Pumpkins contain hypoglycemic substances that may
  improve diabetes. Pumpkins and pumpkin seeds have components such as squalene, beta-carotene,
  alpha-carotene, and various tocopherols with suspected or demonstrated cancer fighting
  properties. Pumpkin polysaccharide has been shown to possess significant cytoprotective
  effect and antioxidative activity.


  Dietary intake of pumpkin was found to be protective against head and neck cancer
  in one Eastern European study. Studies have found that those with very low plasma
  levels of alpha-carotene and beta-carotene are at a higher risk of gastric cancer.
  Intake of orange and yellow vegetables may also be protective against prostate cancer
  and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. However, one Japanese study that found a reduced risk
  of lung cancer in males with frequent consumption of raw and green vegetables, fruit
  and milk, found an increased risk of lung cancer associated with the consumption
  of carrots, pumpkins, eggs and coffee.


  Most of the population-based breast cancer studies performed to date that specifically
  included pumpkins were conducted in Japan. One Japanese study found that consuming
  vegetables  reduced the risk of gastric, breast, lung and colorectal cancer, regardless
  of the family history of cancer. Another Japanese study found reductions in breast
  cancer risk associated with high intakes of green-yellow vegetables  among both
  premenopausal and postmenopausal women.


  Pumpkin flesh and seeds should be eaten cooked or roasted, not raw. One study found
  that raw pumpkin juice increased chromosomal damage in bone marrow cells of experimental
  rats treated with a carcinogen whereas boiled pumpkin juice significantly suppressed
  it.


  Pumpkin seeds and pumpkin seed oil are rich sources of phytoestrogens and cucurbitacin
  E. One study found that pumpkin seed oil supplementation prevented changes in plasma
  lipids and blood pressure associated with inadequate estrogen availability in experimental
  rats that had their ovaries removed. Cucurbitacin E has been shown to inhibit triple
  negative breast cancer metastasis in the laboratory by suppressing cell migration
  and invasion. On the other hand, pumpkin seeds also contains relatively high levels
  of copper, which has been shown to increase angiogenesis and metastasis of breast
  cancer.
