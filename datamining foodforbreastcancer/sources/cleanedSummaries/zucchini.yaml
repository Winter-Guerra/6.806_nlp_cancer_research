  Zucchini  or courgette, is a variety of summer squash. This category also includes
  yellow crookneck, pattypan, scallop and yellow summer squash. Yellow-fleshed winter
  squash such as acorn, butternut, or spaghetti squash are covered under pumpkins.
  Zucchini is a good source of vitamin C, vitamin A, vitamin B6, manganese and magnesium,
  and also contains vitamin K, folate, potassium, phosphorus and some copper. Zucchini
  also is a good dietary source of the lignan secoisolariciresinol, cucurbitacin E,
  and carotenoids such as lutein and zeaxanthin. Zucchini consumption has been found
  to be associated lower risk of gastric cancer.


  Numerous studies have found an inverse association between breast cancer risk and
  high dietary levels of carotenoids such as beta-carotene, lutein and zeaxanthin.
  Some, but not all, population studies have found that consumption of the lignan
  secoisolariciresinol is associated with lower risk of breast cancer. A Korean case-control
  study comparing the diets of breast cancer patients with a healthy control group
  found that the breast cancer patients consumed a significantly lower quantity of
  zucchini, among other foods, than the controls.


  Boiling or frying zucchini significantly reduces its antioxidant capacity.
