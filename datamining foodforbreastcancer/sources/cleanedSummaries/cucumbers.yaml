  Like watermelons, pumpkins, zucchini and other types of squash, cucumbers  belong
  to the cucurbitaceae  family. Cucumbers have a high water content and are low in
  calories and relatively low in nutrients compared to most other vegetables. The
  flesh of the cucumber contains some vitamin C and vitamin A. Cucumber components
  which have been shown to have some anticancer activities include fisetin, lutein,
  caffeic acid and cucurbitacins. The skin of the cucumber is a source of dietary
  fiber and contains minerals such as potassium, magnesium, and molybdenum. Cucumbers
  have been shown to have some antioxidant activities, but these are low compared
  to those of intensely colored vegetables and do not appear to be the source of its
  apparent anticancer properties. Cucumber consumption may help reduce cholesterol.
  Cucumber fruit and leaf extracts have been found to be useful in lightening and
  soothing the skin, and to treat inflammatory skin conditions such as rosacea.


  Cucumbers with excessive bitterness are typically rejected by the consumer and cultivated
  species have been selected for low bitterness. The bitterness is caused by a class
  of phytochemicals called cucurbitacins, which have been shown to have some anticancer
  properties, but which also can be highly toxic when ingested. Fisetin, a flavonoid
  found in cucumbers, has been shown to reduce the viability of postate cancer cells
  in the laboratory without harming normal prostate cancer cells. Consumption of cucumbers
  has been found to be associated with lower risk of lung cancer among tin miners
  in China.


  Caffeic acid has been shown to have antiproliferative and apoptotic effects on human
  breast cancer cells in the laboratory. A Korean case-control study comparing the
  diets of breast cancer patients with a healthy control group of women found that
  the breast cancer patients consumed a significantly lower quantity of vegetables,
  including cucumbers, than the control group. A Greek study also found that women
  with breast cancer consumed significantly less cucumber than those without breast
  cancer. A Swiss study found that consumption of cucumbers, among other fruits and
  vegetables, was associated with significant protection against breast cancer.


  Gherkins are a different cultivar of Cucumis sativus and have a similar nutritional
  profile as cucumbers. Seedless cucumbers typically are longer in length, have thinner
  skins, and are grown in greenhouses. The sodium content of commercial dill pickles,
  sweet pickles, bread and butter pickles, pickle relish and pickled gherkins can
  be high.


  Although cucumber skin is nutritious, waxed cucumbers should always be peeled before
  consumption since the wax can trap pesticide residue and other contaminants. Non-organic
  cucumbers must be washed very thoroughly to remove pesticides as much as possible
  before cutting or peeling even if not waxed. Non-organic greenhouse cucumbers were
  found to incorporate unacceptably high levels of cadmium, lead, and chromium in
  one 2009 study.


  Colocynth, also known as bitter apple or bitter cucumber, is related to cucumber,
  but contains a much higher fraction of cucurbitacins. Colocynth and other high-cucurbitacin
  cucurbits are sometimes sold as herbal remedies, including for cancer. However,
  while chemotherapy based on cucurbitacins may eventually be developed, these are
  toxic chemicals whose safety profiles and appropriate dosages have not been determined.
