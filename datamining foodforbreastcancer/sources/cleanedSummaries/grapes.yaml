  Grapes contain polyphenols  that can act as antioxidants, antiangiogenics, and selective
  estrogen receptor modifiers. Each of these polyphenols have been found to have chemopreventative
  properties. Grapes also contain lupeol, pterostilbene, and fisetin, which also have
  been shown to have anti-cancer properties. Green or white grapes have less powerful
  anticancer properties than red grapes since they contain fewer polyphenols. Note
  that grape seed oil and grape seed extract are covered in another web page.


  Red grapes and grape seeds are a good source of resveratrol, which has the ability
  to suppress proliferation of breast cancer cells and promote cell death. Resveratrol
  also can inhibit aromatase, which is important for reducing growth-stimulatory effects
  in estrogen-dependent breast cancer. Other grape polyphenols such as quercetin and
  catechin have also been shown to have chemopreventive effects and appear to act
  synergistically with resveratrol in inhibiting breast cancer growth. Several population
  studies have reported that grape consumption is associated with reduced risk of
  breast cancer.


  Resveratrol has also been shown to increase the effects of radiation treatment and
  the chemotherapy drug Taxol  against breast cancer.


  Non-organic  grapes must be washed very thoroughly to remove pesticide residue.
