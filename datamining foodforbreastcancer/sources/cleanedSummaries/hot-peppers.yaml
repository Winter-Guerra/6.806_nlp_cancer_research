  Hot peppers include peppers of many varieties in the genus Capsicum that are characterized
  by intense heat resulting from their capsaicinoid contents. Examples include cayenne
  chili peppers, hot chilli peppers, jalapeo peppers, and Sichuan peppers. Also included
  in this category are hot sauce, chili powder, red pepper flakes and red pepper paste.
  Not included are black pepper or bell peppers. By hot sauce, we mean supermarket
  sauces such as Tabasco Sauce and various Louisiana hot sauces, as well as specialty
  sauces advertised as fiery or hot in which the heat is derived from capsaicin-containing
  peppers. By chili powder, we mean the common supermarket spice mixture made primarily
  from the dried, ground fruit of red chili peppers, as well as specialty chili powders
  advertised as hot. Hot peppers have been shown to have anti-inflammatory, antioxidant,
  antiarthritic, analgesic, and antithrombotic properties and may improve cholesterol
  levels and glucose metabolism and assist in weight loss. Most peppers are good dietary
  sources of beta-carotene, lycopene  and vitamin C, as well as flavonoids such as
  apigenin and luteolin.


  Studies concerning hot peppers, capsaicin and cancer have produced mixed results.
  On the one hand, capsaicin has been shown to induce apoptosis in several different
  types of cancer cells and mechanisms have been proposed to explain its apparent
  anti-cancer activity. On the other hand, capsaicin also appears to act as a carcinogen
  in some parts of the body.


  As noted above, capsaicin has been shown to induce apoptosis or have chemoprotective
  actions in the laboratory in a variety of human cancer cells, including lung, pancreatic,
  bladder, colon, urothelial, and prostate cancer cells. Population studies have found
  hot pepper consumption to be associated with lower risks of lung and liver cancers.
  The population-based evidence with respect to colon cancer is inconsistent.


  Frequent consumption of hot peppers has been found to be associated with esophageal,
  gall bladder and gastric  cancers in multiple population studies. In Chileans, those
  with the highest intake of red chilli peppers and a history of gallstone disease
  have the highest risk of developing gall bladder cancer. One Mexican study found
  that intake of capsaicin was associated with increased risk of gastric cancer independent
  of H. pylori infection. Maternal consumption of chili peppers during pregnancy has
  also been found to be associated with subsequent higher risk for the child of medulloblastoma/primitive
  neuroectodermal tumor, a common childhood brain tumor.


  Capsaicin has been shown to inhibit growth and induce apoptosis in breast cancer
  cells, including HER2/Neu overexpressing  and epidermal growth factor receptor -overexpressing
  breast cancer. Several population studies have found an association between hot
  pepper consumption and lower incidence of breast cancer.


  There is some evidence that breast cancer survivors are at increased risk of developing
  stomach cancer. Lobular breast cancer survivors in particular are vulnerable to
  gastric metastases. Women with lobular breast cancer and those with gallstones,
  as well as pregnant women, should moderate their hot pepper consumption. On the
  other hand, hot pepper consumption may be beneficial for other women with breast
  cancer or those at risk. By this we mean modest amounts up to several times per
  week. Large or frequent meals that have been made very hot by the incorporation
  of one or more forms of hot peppers are to be avoided, as are capsaicin supplements.


  Despite the heat of red chilli peppers, aflatoxin contamination has been found in
  some samples. Aflatoxins, which are produced by various species of Aspergillus fungus,
  are mutagenic, carcinogenic and teratogenic and cause immuno-suppression in humans.
  Aflatoxin B1 has been shown to cause liver cancer, especially in hepatitis B-positive
  individuals. One study of aflatoxin in Indonesian foods found that peanut-chilli
  sauces had one of the highest percentages of aflatoxin contamination, indicating
  that the addition of chili peppers to peanut sauce did not neutralize the aflatoxin
  that probably came, in part, from the peanuts. Buyers of hot peppers, sauces containing
  hot peppers, or hot pepper paste from specialty markets should assure themselves
  of their safety and quality.


  Non-organic peppers must be washed very thoroughly to remove pesticide residue as
  much as possible.
