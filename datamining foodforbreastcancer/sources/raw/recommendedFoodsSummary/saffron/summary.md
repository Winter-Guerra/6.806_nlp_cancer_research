Saffron (Crocus sativus) contains bioactive compounds that are responsible for its color, flavor and aroma. Saffron contains numerous phytoactive components, including crocetin, various crocins (such as picrocrocin), kaempferol, beta-carotene, lycopene, zeaxanthin, and safranal (the main component of saffron's fragrant essential oil). Saffron components have been shown to have strong antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, radioprotective, anti-carcinogenic and anti-tumor properties, as well as reducing blood pressure, anxiety and depression.

Both saffron and crocin have been found to suppress DNA damage in a dose dependent manner in the livers, lungs, kidneys, and spleens of laboratory mice. Saffron has been shown to inhibit carcinogen-induced skin carcinoma in mice and to have cytotoxic action against human leukemia cell lines. Saffron also has been shown to cause cell death in HeLa and HepG2 liver cancer cells and TCC 5637 transitional cell carcinoma cells. Saffron extract and its constituent, crocin, have been shown to significantly inhibit the growth of colorectal cancer cells while not harming normal cells. Crocetin, a major carotenoid component of saffron, has been shown to have significant antiproliferative and proapoptic effects in pancreatic cancer cells in the laboratory and in laboratory mice.

## Breast cancer-related effects of eating saffron 

Saffron has been shown to have dose-dependent inhibitory effects on the proliferation of hormone receptor positive (ER+/PR+) and triple negative (ER-/PR-/HER2-) breast cancer cells. Saffron has also been shown to reduce angiogenesis (new blood vessel formation) in ER+/PR+ breast cancer cells.

Saffron has been found to greatly inhibit cellular DNA damage, including Adriamycin-induced heart damage. However, we do not recommend it during Adriamycin-based chemotherapy since it might also protect cancer cells from the treatment. One study reported that concurrent use of cyclophosphamide and saffron extract reduced toxic effect of cyclophosphamide and caused estrogen to be produced. Another study reported that pre-treatment with saffron significantly inhibited cellular DNA damage caused by cisplatin. On the other hand, extracts of saffron have been shown to considerably increase the cytotoxicity in breast cancer cells induced by Taxol (paclitaxel). Based on the available evidence, saffron should be limited or avoided during chemotherapy.

Saffron's radioprotective properties indicate that it should not be used during radiation treatment.

There is some evidence that saffron could be toxic at very high doses and we recommend consuming saffron as a spice and not taking saffron tablets.

## Additional comments

Saffron is hand picked and hand processed, which is one reason for its high market price. Saffron is grown primarily in Iran, but it is also grown in Spain, Portugal, Italy, Kashmir and some parts of North Africa. Much of the Iranian production is redistributed through Spain. Saffron grown in these regions generally is grown without using pesticides. China is also beginning to produce saffron.

Meadow saffron (Colchicum autumnale), also known as wild saffron, Autumn crocus, or colchicum, is an unrelated and poisonous plant that should not be confused with saffron and is to be avoided. It can cause thirst, pain, diarrhea, weakness, vomiting, kidney failure, coma, and death from respiratory failure. Diluted fractions of meadow saffron are sometimes used in herbal remedies for gout and arthritis.
