Like pears, apples are a member of the Rosaceae family. The most beneficial varieties have red, rosy or red streaked peels. The peel has the most micronutrients, however, nonorganic apple peels are likely to be contaminated with pesticides.

## Breast cancer-related effects of eating apples 

One study found that the consumption of apples was inversely related to the risk of breast cancer when the results were adjusted for factors such as age, education, body mass index (BMI), alcohol consumption, total energy intake, vegetable consumption and physical activity.

Apples have been shown to shrink the size of mammary tumors in rats and to induce breast cancer cell apoptosis. Apple peel contains chemicals that may be important for this effect. One study reported that an apple peel diet significantly inhibited the growth of mammary tumors in a mouse model of breast cancer. The same study reported that a triterpenoid found in apple peel induced apoptosis (programmed cell death) in triple negative breast cancer cells.

The apple flavonoid phloretin has been shown to increase the anti-cancer effects of the chemotherapy drug Taxol (paclitaxel).

## Additional comments

Red apples have more antioxidant and antiproliferative phytochemicals than green or yellow apples. Organic U.S. apples are the best choice. Non-organic apples must be washed very thoroughly to remove pesticide residue. Apple juice is not particularly beneficial compared to raw apples, however cloudy apple juice has more antioxidants than clear apple juice. There have been reports of meaningful levels of arsenic in apple juice produced from apples grown in countries that use certian pesticides no longer approved for use in the U.S.
