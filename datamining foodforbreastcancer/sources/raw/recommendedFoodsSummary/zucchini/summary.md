Zucchini (Cucurbita pepo Zucchini) or courgette, is a variety of summer squash. This category also includes yellow crookneck, pattypan, scallop and yellow summer squash. Yellow-fleshed winter squash such as acorn, butternut, or spaghetti squash are covered under pumpkins. Zucchini is a good source of vitamin C, vitamin A (through its beta-carotene content), vitamin B6, manganese and magnesium, and also contains vitamin K, folate, potassium, phosphorus and some copper. Zucchini also is a good dietary source of the lignan secoisolariciresinol (a precursor of enterolactone), cucurbitacin E, and carotenoids such as lutein and zeaxanthin (in addition to beta-carotene). Zucchini consumption has been found to be associated lower risk of gastric cancer.

## Breast cancer-related effects of eating zucchini 

Numerous studies have found an inverse association between breast cancer risk and high dietary levels of carotenoids such as beta-carotene, lutein and zeaxanthin. Some, but not all, population studies have found that consumption of the lignan secoisolariciresinol is associated with lower risk of breast cancer. A Korean case-control study comparing the diets of breast cancer patients with a healthy control group found that the breast cancer patients consumed a significantly lower quantity of zucchini, among other foods, than the controls.
