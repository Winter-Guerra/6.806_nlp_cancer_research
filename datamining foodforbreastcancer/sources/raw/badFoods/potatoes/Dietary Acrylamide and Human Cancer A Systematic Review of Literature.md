# Dietary Acrylamide and Human Cancer: A Systematic Review of Literature

## Abstract

Cancer remains the second leading cause of death in the United States, and the number of cases is expected to continue to rise worldwide. Cancer prevention strategies are crucial for reducing the cancer burden. The carcinogenic potential of dietary acrylamide exposure from cooked foods is unknown. Acrylamide is a by-product of the common Maillard reaction where reducing sugars (i.e., fructose and glucose) react with the amino acid, asparagine. Based on the evidence of acrylamide carcinogenicity in animals, the International Agency for Research on Cancer has classified acrylamide as a group 2A carcinogen for humans. Since the discovery of acrylamide in foods in 2002, a number of studies have explored its potential as a human carcinogen. This article outlines a systematic review of dietary acrylamide and human cancer, acrylamide exposure and internal dose, exposure assessment methods in the epidemiologic studies, existing data gaps, and future directions. A majority of the studies reported no statistically significant association between dietary acrylamide intake and various cancers, and few studies reported increased risk for renal, endometrial, and ovarian cancers; however, the exposure assessment has been inadequate leading to potential misclassification or underestimation of exposure. Future studies with improved dietary acrylamide exposure assessment are encouraged.

In 2002, the Swedish National Food Administration first reported the presence of acrylamide in foods (11\. Tareke E, Rydberg P, Karlsson P, Eriksson S, and Tornqvist M: Analysis of acrylamide, a carcinogen formed in heated foodstuffs. J Agric Food Chem 50, 4998–5006, 2002.  
View all references). Acrylamide is a byproduct of the cooking process and is formed when reducing sugars (glucose or fructose) react with the amino acid asparagine during the Maillard reaction (22\.

The levels of acrylamide in cooked foods are thus influenced by factors such as the cooking temperature, length of cooking time, moisture content, and the amount of reducing sugar and asparagine in raw foods (44\. Elmore JS, Koutsidis G, Dodson AT, Mottram DS, and Wedzicha BL: The effect of cooking on acrylamide and its precursors in potato, wheat and rye. Adv Exp Med Biol 561, 255–269, 2005.

For instance, the storage of potatoes at 2°C results in increased free sugar content that converts to higher acrylamide levels during cooking as compared with potatoes stored at 20°C (99\.

View all references). Variations of acrylamide content in various foods, and between batches of the same foods, have presented a challenge for estimating the actual intake by using the commonly used approach such as the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). These variations also present a major challenge of accurately classifying individuals with low or high acrylamide intake.

Since the discovery of acrylamide in foods of everyday consumption (11\. Tareke E, Rydberg P, Karlsson P, Eriksson S, and Tornqvist M: Analysis of acrylamide, a carcinogen formed in heated foodstuffs. J Agric Food Chem 50, 4998–5006, 2002.

View all references). Exposure to dietary acrylamide depends on the amount of acrylamide present in food, the portion size consumed, and the frequency of consumption, as well as cooking and storage methods. Therefore, the variations in global dietary patterns result in different food items contributing most significantly to dietary acrylamide intake. Nonetheless, coffee, fried/baked potatoes, and bakery goods remain among the most common sources in all countries (3131\. Mucci LA and Wilson KM: Acrylamide intake through diet and human cancer risk. J Agric Food Chem 56, 6013–6019, 2008.

Acrylamide is a multiorgan carcinogen in both male and female rodent models. Acrylamide carcinogenicity has been well established in a number of animal models such as rat and mouse; however, the study doses used are 1000–100,000 times higher than the usual amounts, on a weight basis, that humans are exposed to through dietary sources (3131\. Mucci LA and Wilson KM: Acrylamide intake through diet and human cancer risk. J Agric Food Chem 56, 6013–6019, 2008.

View all references) performed meta-analysis of 19 dietary, and 6 occupational studies of acrylamide exposure and cancer. We systematically reviewed evidence for dietary acrylamide exposure and internal dose, as well as the 11 prospective, 10 case-cohort, 6 population-based case-control, and 3 hospital-based case-control original epidemiologic studies published to date that evaluated dietary acrylamide association with various types of cancers. Major scientific literature databases were searched for epidemiological studies on acrylamide, including PubMed and Google, as well as the Joint Institute for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, World Health Organization, and FDA websites. The literature search was focused on articles published between 2002 and March of 2013. A combination of the following search terms was used: dietary acrylamide formation, food sources of acrylamide, acrylamide exposure, heat-formed compounds, cooking temperature, acrylamide metabolism, hemoglobin adducts, urinary metabolites, mercapturic acid, health effects, and cancer.

## ACRYLAMIDE EXPOSURE AND INTERNAL DOSE

### Jump to section

An individual's acrylamide exposure reflects the combined intake from diet, smoking, secondhand smoke, drinking water, occupational sources, toiletries, and household items. Acrylamide absorption through dermal exposure is much lower because the skin provides a barrier that reduces acrylamide uptake (3737\. Fennell TR, Sumner SC, Snyder RW, Burgess J, Spicer R, et al.: Metabolism and hemoglobin adduct formation of acrylamide in humans. Toxicol Sci 85, 447–459, 2005.  
View all references). However, oral exposure is critical in determining the amount of acrylamide and its metabolites that circulate in the body. After oral ingestion in humans, acrylamide is rapidly absorbed and eliminated in the urine, with a reported half-life of 3.1–3.5 h (3838\. Fennell TR, Sumner SC, Snyder RW, Burgess J, and Friedman MA: Kinetics of elimination of urinary metabolites of acrylamide in humans. Toxicol Sci 93, 256–267, 2006.  
View all references). Pathways of conjugation with glutathione play an important role in helping the body to excrete acrylamide as urinary metabolites (Fig. 1). The acrylamide can also undergo epoxidation to form the genotoxic metabolite glycidamide through cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) activity (3939\. Bergmark E, Calleman CJ, and Costa LG: Formation of hemoglobin adducts of acrylamide and its epoxide metabolite glycidamide in the rat. Toxicol Appl Pharmacol 111, 352–363, 1991.  
View all references–4141\. Sumner SC, Fennell TR, Moore TA, Chanas B, Gonzalez F, et al.: Role of cytochrome P450 2E1 in the metabolism of acrylamide and acrylonitrile in mice. Chem Res Toxicol 12, 1110–1116, 1999.  
View all references). Variation in exposure to glycidamide may result from polymorphisms in CYP2E1 that cause this enzyme to have different catalytic rates. In addition, compounds that can suppress CYP2E1 activity, such as allyl and diallyl sulfide, may suppress glycidamide formation in humans. Diallyl sulfide from garlic has been shown to inhibit CYP2E1 and suppress acrylamide metabolism to glycidamide in rat livers (4242\. Taubert D, Glockner R, Muller D, and Schomig E: The garlic ingredient diallyl sulfide inhibits cytochrome P450 2E1 dependent bioactivation of acrylamide to glycidamide. Toxicol Lett 164, 1–5, 2006.  
View all references). Moreover, CYP2E1 knockout mice, compared with the wild type, showed a 95% reduction in acrylamide bioconversion to glycidamide (4343\. Ghanayem BI, Witt KL, Kissling GE, Tice RR, and Recio L: Absence of acrylamide-induced genotoxicity in CYP2E1-null mice: evidence consistent with a glycidamide-mediated effect. Mutat Res 578, 284–297, 2005.  

Both acrylamide and glycidamide bind to hemoglobin in red blood cells, and the determination of the resulting adducts provides an estimation of the internal dose that accounts for both absorption and metabolism of these compounds over the life of the red blood cells (120 days) (4444\. Fennell TR, Sumner SC, and Walker VE: A model for the formation and removal of hemoglobin adducts. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev 1, 213–219, 1992.  
View all references). Smokers, on average, have 3 to 5 times higher hemoglobin adducts of acrylamide (HbAA) and glycidamide (HbGA) (4545\.

View all references) assessed the acrylamide and glycidamide exposure among general U.S. population from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2003–2004. The levels of HbAA and HbGA ranged between 3–910 and 4–756 pmol/g hemoglobin, respectively. In addition to the wide variation in the adduct levels, data also suggested the presence of racial and age disparities. The highest levels were found in Mexican Americans and the lowest in non-Hispanic blacks. Surprisingly, children between the ages of 3–11 yr had higher levels as compared with adults ≥60 yr (4747\. Vesper HW, Caudill SP, Osterloh JD, Meyers T, Scott D, et al.: Exposure of the U.S. population to acrylamide in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2003–2004. Environ Health Perspect 118, 278–283, 2010.  
View all references). Smokers had the highest levels for both HbAA and HbGA. In addition, participants with secondhand smoke exposure, compared with those with no smoke exposure, had higher HbAA and HbGA adducts. These results suggest that acrylamide exposure among nonsmokers may not only be through food consumption. The study by Vesper et al. estimated an average dietary acrylamide intake of 0.8 μg/kg/day in the nonsmoking U.S. population (4747\. Vesper HW, Caudill SP, Osterloh JD, Meyers T, Scott D, et al.: Exposure of the U.S. population to acrylamide in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2003–2004. Environ Health Perspect 118, 278–283, 2010.  
View all references). Children and adolescents have typically been reported to have higher exposure to dietary acrylamide, which could be explained in part by their higher consumption of acrylamide-containing foods (such as potato chips, French fries, and cookies) and lower mean body weight compared with adults (4848\. Dybing E, Farmer PB, Andersen M, Fennell TR, Lalljie SP, et al.: Human exposure and internal dose assessments of acrylamide in food. Food Chem Toxicol 43, 365–410, 2005.  

Svensson et al. conducted a study of dietary intake of acrylamide in Sweden in 2002. The authors used the 1997–1998 Swedish National Food Administration Food Survey consumption data (from a 77\.

View all references). The average daily intake of acrylamide was 0.5 μg/kg body weight/day in the study population. However, the average dietary exposure in this study did not include acrylamide exposure from smoking; hence, the average intake may be underestimated for smokers and those individuals exposed to secondhand smoke. Similarly, dietary acrylamide intake in the Dutch population (aged 1–97 yr) is estimated at 0.48 μg/kg body weight/day. Using the Dutch population data, acrylamide intake among children (aged 1–6 yr) is estimated at 1.04 μg/kg body weight/day, representing twice as much acrylamide intake compared with the total population (5050\. Konings EJ, Baars AJ, van Klaveren JD, Spanjer MC, Rensen PM, et al.: Acrylamide exposure from foods of the Dutch population and an assessment of the consequent risks. Food Chem Toxicol 41, 1569–1579, 2003.  

A pilot study of 11 pregnant women examined the trans-placental exposure of acrylamide to neonates. The levels of HbAA adducts in umbilical cord blood were approximately 50% of that of the mothers. Only 1 study participant was a smoker and the highest adduct levels were detected in the participant and her child (5151\. Schettgen T, Kutting B, Hornig M, Beckmann MW, Weiss T, et al.: Trans-placental exposure of neonates to acrylamide—a pilot study. Int Arch Occup Environ Health 77, 213–216, 2004.  
View all references). The ability of acrylamide to cross the placental barrier has raised concerns about its safety in infants and potential health effects. Studies from the Norwegian Mother and Child cohort (5252\. Magnus P, Irgens LM, Haug K, Nystad W, Skjaerven R, et al.: Cohort profile: the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa). Int J Epidemiol 35, 1146–1150, 2006.  
View all references), which recruited 100,000 pregnant women from 1999 to 2008, may provide such data on mothers and their children.

A number of epidemiologic studies have estimated acrylamide intake by using self-reported questionnaires and, occasionally, questionnaires administered by trained interviewers. It should be noted that such calculations, in the absence of measuring hemoglobin adduct biomarkers, will not reflect a biologically effective dose exposure. Batch-to-batch variation in the acrylamide content of foods, as well as reporting and recall biases may cause the estimate to be farther away from the true exposure level. Wilson et al. (3030\. Wilson KM, Balter K, Adami HO, Gronberg H, Vikstrom AC, et al.: Acrylamide exposure measured by food frequency questionnaire and hemoglobin adduct levels and prostate cancer risk in the Cancer of the Prostate in Sweden Study. Int J Cancer 124, 2384–2390, 2009.

Similarly, Kutting et al. (5353\. Kutting B, Uter W, and Drexler H: The association between self-reported acrylamide intake and hemoglobin adducts as biomarkers of exposure. Cancer Causes Control 19, 273–281, 2008.

View all references). The important points to consider while evaluating acrylamide intake through FFQ data include recall biases, exposures are estimated by capturing the previous year's dietary intakes, and variation in dietary patterns across different countries. In addition, for a given cooked food item, acrylamide levels can be influenced by free sugars and asparagine composition of the raw food, variations in cooking temperatures, varying lengths of cooking time, and different cooking methods used. Estimation of exposure to acrylamide from cigarette smoking as well as from other potential sources could differ depending on how detail the questions are structured to capture such exposures.

### TABLE 1 Prospective cohort studies of dietary acrylamide intake and cancer


### Cohort of Swedish Men

A prospective cohort study of Swedish men began in 1997, and 48,850 participants (aged 45–79 yr) were recruited. The baseline dietary intake was measured using a 96-item self-administered FFQ (1212\. Larsson SC, Akesson A, and Wolk A: Dietary acrylamide intake and prostate cancer risk in a prospective cohort of Swedish men. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev 18, 1939–1941, 2009.  
View all references). During the mean follow-up time of 9.1 yr; there were 1088 cases of localized prostate cancer and 951 cases of advanced prostate cancer. Information on the clinical stage and Gleason grade was available for the patients. The mean intake of dietary acrylamide estimated from the baseline FFQ was 36.1 ± 9.6 μg/day, and there was no statistically significant association between highest vs. lowest quintiles of dietary acrylamide exposure and prostate cancer [relative risk (RR) 0.88; 95% CI: 0.70–1.09] (1212\.

View all references), there were no statistically significant associations between dietary acrylamide intake and colorectal cancer (RR = 0.95; 95% CI: 0.74–1.20) (21). Given that cigarette smoke is an important source of acrylamide exposure, the authors further stratified participants according to smoking status, but this did not change the lack of associations between acrylamide and prostate or colorectal cancer (1212\. Larsson SC, Akesson A, and Wolk A: Dietary acrylamide intake and prostate cancer risk in a prospective cohort of Swedish men. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev 18, 1939–1941, 2009.

View all references). However, it is important to notice that for these analyses, acrylamide intake was assessed from the baseline FFQ only. The quality of these results is limited by the potential misclassifications resulting from any changes in acrylamide exposure over time, as well as lack of information on potentially new food items that might have contributed to acrylamide exposure in this population.

### Cohorts of Swedish Women

Two breast cancer cohort studies—the Swedish Mammography Cohort and the Women's Lifestyle and Health Cohort from Sweden—were included in this review. Larsson et al. (1313\. Larsson SC, Akesson A, and Wolk A: Long-term dietary acrylamide intake and breast cancer risk in a prospective cohort of Swedish women. Am J Epidemiol 169, 376–381, 2009.  
View all references) analyzed the association between dietary acrylamide intake and breast cancer from the Swedish Mammography Cohort (1313\. Larsson SC, Akesson A, and Wolk A: Long-term dietary acrylamide intake and breast cancer risk in a prospective cohort of Swedish women. Am J Epidemiol 169, 376–381, 2009.  
View all references). Dietary acrylamide was estimated using FFQs among 36,664 women (1313\. Larsson SC, Akesson A, and Wolk A: Long-term dietary acrylamide intake and breast cancer risk in a prospective cohort of Swedish women. Am J Epidemiol 169, 376–381, 2009.  
View all references). The FFQs were administered at the baseline during 1987–1990, and then at follow-up in 1997 (1313\. Larsson SC, Akesson A, and Wolk A: Long-term dietary acrylamide intake and breast cancer risk in a prospective cohort of Swedish women. Am J Epidemiol 169, 376–381, 2009.  
View all references). However, the mean daily acrylamide exposure 24.6 ± 7.6 μg was estimated from the baseline questionnaire only (1313\. Larsson SC, Akesson A, and Wolk A: Long-term dietary acrylamide intake and breast cancer risk in a prospective cohort of Swedish women. Am J Epidemiol 169, 376–381, 2009.  
View all references). There were no statistically significant associations between acrylamide exposure and all invasive tumors (RR = 0.91; 95% CI: 0.80–1.02) (13), or hormone receptor specific tumors [estrogen receptor positive/progesterone receptor positive (ER+PR+) RR = 0.89; 95% CI: 0.74–1.08, ER+/ progesterone receptor negative (PR-) RR = 1.17; 95% CI: 0.84–1.64, estrogen receptor negative (ER-)/PR- (RR = 0.91; 95% CI: 0.61–1.38)] (13); in addition, no significant effect modification were observed by smoking status (13). The second study by Mucci et al. (1616\. Mucci LA, Sandin S, Balter K, Adami HO, Magnusson C, et al.: Acrylamide intake and breast cancer risk in Swedish women. JAMA 293, 1326–1327, 2005.  
View all references), from the Women's Lifestyle and Health Cohort, was an 11-yr follow-up study (1991–2002) of 43,404 women (1616\. Mucci LA, Sandin S, Balter K, Adami HO, Magnusson C, et al.: Acrylamide intake and breast cancer risk in Swedish women. JAMA 293, 1326–1327, 2005.  
View all references). Dietary acrylamide exposure, measured using a semiquantitative questionnaire (1616\. Mucci LA, Sandin S, Balter K, Adami HO, Magnusson C, et al.: Acrylamide intake and breast cancer risk in Swedish women. JAMA 293, 1326–1327, 2005.  
View all references), showed a daily mean intake of 25.9 μg (16). There was no association between acrylamide exposure and breast cancer risk for the lowest vs. highest quintiles of dietary acrylamide intake (RR = 1.19; 95% CI: 0.91–1.55) (16).

Recently, Larsson et al. (1414\. Larsson SC, Akesson A, and Wolk A: Long-term dietary acrylamide intake and risk of epithelial ovarian cancer in a prospective cohort of Swedish women. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev 18, 994–997, 2009.  
View all references) reported lack of an association between long-term dietary acrylamide intake and ovarian cancer in a population of Swedish women. The study recruited 61,057 women, and measured dietary acrylamide intake at baseline (1987–1990) and again in 1997 with a follow-up questionnaire. The mean dietary acrylamide intake in this population was 24.6 ± 7.6 μg per day. After 17.5 yr of follow-up (1414\. Larsson SC, Akesson A, and Wolk A: Long-term dietary acrylamide intake and risk of epithelial ovarian cancer in a prospective cohort of Swedish women. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev 18, 994–997, 2009.  
View all references), a total of 368 histologically confirmed cases of invasive epithelial ovarian cancer were identified (1414\. Larsson SC, Akesson A, and Wolk A: Long-term dietary acrylamide intake and risk of epithelial ovarian cancer in a prospective cohort of Swedish women. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev 18, 994–997, 2009.  
View all references). These cases were further categorized according to pathological subtypes (1414\. Larsson SC, Akesson A, and Wolk A: Long-term dietary acrylamide intake and risk of epithelial ovarian cancer in a prospective cohort of Swedish women. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev 18, 994–997, 2009.  
View all references). No association was observed between dietary acrylamide intake and ovarian cancer (RR = 0.84; 95% CI: 0.62–1.14) (14). There was a lack of smoking data at baseline (1414\. Larsson SC, Akesson A, and Wolk A: Long-term dietary acrylamide intake and risk of epithelial ovarian cancer in a prospective cohort of Swedish women. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev 18, 994–997, 2009.  
View all references), but the smoking data were collected on the follow-up questionnaire (1414\. Larsson SC, Akesson A, and Wolk A: Long-term dietary acrylamide intake and risk of epithelial ovarian cancer in a prospective cohort of Swedish women. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev 18, 994–997, 2009.  
View all references). The effect of smoking status on the association between acrylamide and cancer were evaluated in stratified analyses for smoking status (1414\. Larsson SC, Akesson A, and Wolk A: Long-term dietary acrylamide intake and risk of epithelial ovarian cancer in a prospective cohort of Swedish women. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev 18, 994–997, 2009.  
View all references). Furthermore, separate analyses stratified for alcohol intake, postmenopausal hormone therapy, and oral contraceptive usages were also performed (1414\. Larsson SC, Akesson A, and Wolk A: Long-term dietary acrylamide intake and risk of epithelial ovarian cancer in a prospective cohort of Swedish women. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev 18, 994–997, 2009.  
View all references). However, these stratified analyses did not change the lack of an association between acrylamide exposure and cancer (1414\. Larsson SC, Akesson A, and Wolk A: Long-term dietary acrylamide intake and risk of epithelial ovarian cancer in a prospective cohort of Swedish women. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev 18, 994–997, 2009.  

Later, Larsson et al. (1515\. Larsson SC, Hakansson N, Akesson A, and Wolk A: Long-term dietary acrylamide intake and risk of endometrial cancer in a prospective cohort of Swedish women. Int J Cancer 124, 1196–1199, 2009.  
View all references) used the same cohort to analyze the association between dietary acrylamide and endometrial cancer (1515\. Larsson SC, Hakansson N, Akesson A, and Wolk A: Long-term dietary acrylamide intake and risk of endometrial cancer in a prospective cohort of Swedish women. Int J Cancer 124, 1196–1199, 2009.  
View all references). Data were analyzed from 36,369 women, a total of 687 incident cases of endometrial adenocarcinoma occurred during the mean follow-up time of 17.7 yr (15). The mean daily dietary acrylamide exposure was similar to that reported in the previous ovarian cancer study by Larsson et al. (14) (24.6 ± 7.6 μg). Subjects with hysterectomy or cancer diagnosis before the start of the study were excluded. The data stratification was similar to those previously described in the ovarian cancer study (14). The follow-up FFQs were analyzed for dietary acrylamide exposure and no associations were observed for endometrial cancer (RR = 0.96; 95% CI: 0.76–1.21) (15). Again, stratification by smoking status did not change this null association (1515\. Larsson SC, Hakansson N, Akesson A, and Wolk A: Long-term dietary acrylamide intake and risk of endometrial cancer in a prospective cohort of Swedish women. Int J Cancer 124, 1196–1199, 2009.  

### Nurses' Health Studies I and II

The Nurses’ Health Study Cohort I started in 1976 and expanded to Nurses’ Health Study II in 1989 and explored lifestyle and health follow-up questionnaires administered every 6 mo since the beginning of the study. A semiquantitative FFQ first administered in 1991, with a follow-up every 4 yr.

Wilson et al. (1919\. Wilson KM, Mucci LA, Cho E, Hunter DJ, Chen WY, et al.: Dietary acrylamide intake and risk of premenopausal breast cancer. Am J Epidemiol 169, 954–961.  
View all references) analyzed dietary acrylamide intake and breast cancer risk among 90,628 premenopausal women (1919\. Wilson KM, Mucci LA, Cho E, Hunter DJ, Chen WY, et al.: Dietary acrylamide intake and risk of premenopausal breast cancer. Am J Epidemiol 169, 954–961.  
View all references). Dietary acrylamide intake was estimated from multiple follow-up FFQs from 1991, 1995, 1999, and 2003 (19). Women with a cancer diagnosis prior to 1991 and those with extreme energy intake (&lt;800 or &gt;4200 kcal/day) or postmenopausal status at baseline were excluded from the analysis (1919\. Wilson KM, Mucci LA, Cho E, Hunter DJ, Chen WY, et al.: Dietary acrylamide intake and risk of premenopausal breast cancer. Am J Epidemiol 169, 954–961.  
View all references). There were 1179 invasive breast cancer cases documented during the 14-yr follow-up period (19). Separate analyses were performed according to smoking status and stratification of the study participants to a number of confounders. Similar to other prospective cohorts (1313\. Larsson SC, Akesson A, and Wolk A: Long-term dietary acrylamide intake and breast cancer risk in a prospective cohort of Swedish women. Am J Epidemiol 169, 376–381, 2009.

View all references), this study did not reveal any increased risk of breast cancer associated with dietary acrylamide intake (RR = 0.92; 95% CI: 0.76–1.11) (19).

Wilson et al. (5656\. Wilson KM, Mucci LA, Rosner BA, and Willett WC: A prospective study of dietary acrylamide intake and the risk of breast, endometrial, and ovarian cancers. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev 10, 2503–2515, 2010.  
View all references) analyzed dietary acrylamide intake and the risk of breast, endometrial, and ovarian cancers among U.S. women from the Nurses’ Health Study I cohort (56). There was lack of an association between dietary acrylamide exposure and overall breast cancer (RR = 0.95; 95% CI: 0.87–1.03), or hormone receptor specific cancer [ER+PR+ (RR = 0.99; 95% CI: 0.87–1.13), ER+PR (RR = 1.04; 95% CI: 0.80–1.34) (56), ER-PR+ (RR = 1.09; 95% CI: 0.63–1.87) (56), or ER-PR- (RR = 0.88; 95% CI: 0.70–1.11)] (56). The data showed an increased risk for endometrial cancer (RR = 1.41; 95% CI: 1.01–1.97) (56), but no associations were observed for overall ovarian cancer (RR = 1.25; 95% CI: 0.88–1.77) (56). There was a statistically significant increased risk for a serous subtype of ovarian cancer (RR = 1.58; 95% CI: 0.99–2.52) (56).

### Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention Study in Finland

The Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention (ATBC) study was a double-blind, placebo-controlled primary intervention study among Finnish smoker men between the ages 50–69 yr that smoked least 5 cigarettes per day. The purpose of the study was to determine whether certain vitamin supplements would prevent lung cancer and other cancers in a group of 29,133 male smokers in Finland. At baseline, dietary data were collected using a comprehensive 276 food items FFQ along with a booklet of 122 pictures of portions sizes of various foods. Hirvonen et al. (57) estimated dietary acrylamide exposure from the baseline FFQ among 27,111 participants (5757\. Hirvonen T, Kontto J, Jestoi M, Valsta L, Peltonen K, et al.: Dietary acrylamide intake and the risk of cancer among Finnish male smokers. Cancer Causes Control 21, 2223–2229, 2010.  
View all references). The dietary acrylamide exposure was divided into quintiles (lowest quintile 21.9 μg/day, and highest quintile 55.7 μg/day). Dietary acrylamide exposure was associated with increased lung cancer for those in the highest compared to the lowest quintile (RR = 1.18; 95% CI: 1.01–1.38) (57). No associations between dietary acrylamide and cancer of the prostate, urothelial, pancreatic, stomach, renal cell, or lymphomas were observed (57). Given that the acrylamide exposure estimated from the baseline FFQ only, the dietary patterns as well as food levels of acrylamide may have changed over time (5757\. Hirvonen T, Kontto J, Jestoi M, Valsta L, Peltonen K, et al.: Dietary acrylamide intake and the risk of cancer among Finnish male smokers. Cancer Causes Control 21, 2223–2229, 2010.  
View all references). In addition, the ATBC trial was an intervention trial and was not designed to evaluate dietary acrylamide associations with cancer, also the fact that the similar interventions among smokers has previously been shown to increase lung cancer risk (5858\. Satia JA, Littman A, Slatore CG, Galanko JA, and White E: Long-term use of beta-carotene, retinol, lycopene, and lutein supplements and lung cancer risk: results from the VITamins And Lifestyle (VITAL) study.

## THE HEALTH PROFESSIONALS FOLLOW-UP STUDY

### Jump to section

The Health Professionals Follow-up Study among U.S. men began in 1986 and recruited 51,529 male health professionals between the ages of 40–75 yr. The study administered first FFQ at the baseline in 1990 and a follow-up FFQ every 4 yr. Subjects with missing dietary information, extremely high energy intakes, and those with cancer diagnosis within the first year of study initiation were excluded, and data from 47,896 subjects were included in the analyses (6161\. Wilson KM, Giovannucci E, Stampfer MJ, and Mucci LA: Dietary acrylamide and risk of prostate cancer. Int J Cancer 131, 479–487, 2012.  
View all references). Dietary acrylamide exposure was estimated from the baseline as well as the follow-up FFQs. The mean acrylamide exposure values from baseline were assigned for the 1986–1990 follow-up, the mean values from the 1986 and 1990 FFQ were assigned for the 1990–1994 follow-up, and so on for the cumulative long-term acrylamide exposure (6161\. Wilson KM, Giovannucci E, Stampfer MJ, and Mucci LA: Dietary acrylamide and risk of prostate cancer. Int J Cancer 131, 479–487, 2012.  
View all references). From 1986 to 2006, a total of 5025 prostate cancer cases were diagnosed. The estimated mean dietary acrylamide exposure for the lowest vs. highest quintile was 10.1–40.5 μg/day. There were no statistically significant associations observed between highest vs. lowest quintile of dietary acrylamide exposure and total prostate cancer (RR = 1.02, 95% CI: 0.93–1.13) (61). Further, no associations were observed for smokers (RR = 1.01; 95% CI: 0.85–1.19). In addition, dietary acrylamide was not associated with subtypes of stages of prostate cancer (61).

### NLCSDC

The NLCSDC began in 1986 (6262\. van den Brandt PA, Goldbohm RA, van't Veer P, Volovics A, Hermus RJ, et al.: A large-scale prospective cohort study on diet and cancer in The Netherlands. J Clin Epidemiol43, 285–295, 1990.  
View all references) and recruited 58,279 men and 62,573 women (_N_ = 120,852 participants) between the ages of 55–69 yr (62). The baseline data on obesity, food habits, physical activity, smoking habits, occupational history, socioeconomic status, medical history, chronic drug use, and family history of cancer were collected using a self-administered questionnaire (6262\. van den Brandt PA, Goldbohm RA, van't Veer P, Volovics A, Hermus RJ, et al.: A large-scale prospective cohort study on diet and cancer in The Netherlands. J Clin Epidemiol43, 285–295, 1990.  
View all references). A subcohort of 5000 subjects was formed and followed to gather data on migration and vital statistics (6262\. van den Brandt PA, Goldbohm RA, van't Veer P, Volovics A, Hermus RJ, et al.: A large-scale prospective cohort study on diet and cancer in The Netherlands. J Clin Epidemiol43, 285–295, 1990.  
View all references). The dietary intakes were assessed using a 175 items FFQ, and were analyzed from 3500 subjects from the subcohort (6262\. van den Brandt PA, Goldbohm RA, van't Veer P, Volovics A, Hermus RJ, et al.: A large-scale prospective cohort study on diet and cancer in The Netherlands. J Clin Epidemiol43, 285–295, 1990.  
View all references). To assess changes in eating habits, the investigators administered the questionnaires annually to a sub-sample of 250 subjects (6262\. van den Brandt PA, Goldbohm RA, van't Veer P, Volovics A, Hermus RJ, et al.: A large-scale prospective cohort study on diet and cancer in The Netherlands. J Clin Epidemiol43, 285–295, 1990.  
View all references). However, no information about changes in dietary habits was reported in the case-cohort studies. It is unknown whether changes in dietary patterns were assessed for any potential changes in the acrylamide exposure during the follow-up period.

Pedersen et al. (1717\. Pedersen GS, Hogervorst JG, Schouten LJ, Konings EJ, Goldbohm RA, et al.: Dietary acrylamide intake and estrogen and progesterone receptor-defined postmenopausal breast cancer risk. Breast Cancer Res Treat 122, 199–210, 2010.  
View all references) analyzed NLCSDC data for acrylamide intake and risk of postmenopausal breast cancer stratified by receptor status. The acrylamide exposure was estimated from the baseline FFQs (1717\. Pedersen GS, Hogervorst JG, Schouten LJ, Konings EJ, Goldbohm RA, et al.: Dietary acrylamide intake and estrogen and progesterone receptor-defined postmenopausal breast cancer risk. Breast Cancer Res Treat 122, 199–210, 2010.  
View all references). There were no statistically significant associations between dietary acrylamide exposure and total postmenopausal breast cancer [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.15; 95% CI: 0.86–1.53] (17), ER+ (HR = 1.15; 95% CI: 0.86–1.53) (17), PR+ (HR = 1.47; 95% CI: 0.86–2.51) (17), or ER+PR+ (HR = 1.43; 95% CI: 0.83–2.46), ER- (HR = 0.95; 95% CI: 0.52–1.72) (17), PR- (HR = 0.84; 95% CI: 0.63–1.56) (17), or ER-PR- (HR = 0.90; 95% CI: 0.48–1.68) breast cancer (17). Data on smoking status, years of smoking, and number of cigarettes smoked per day were also included in the models (17).

Hogervorst et al. (20) analyzed a subcohort from NLCSDC for dietary acrylamide exposure and gastrointestinal cancer risk (20). No associations were observed for acrylamide exposure and colorectal (20), colonic (20), rectal (20), gastric (20), pancreatic (20), microscopically verified pancreatic (20), or esophageal cancers (20), or esophageal adenocarcinoma or esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (Fig. 2) (20). The mean acrylamide exposure among the subcohort was 21.7 ± 12.1 μg (0.17–0.47 μg/kg body weight/day) (20) and is lower than the average daily intake reported among the U.S. nonsmoking population (0.8 μg/kg body weight/day) (47). Hogervorst et al. evaluated the associations between dietary acrylamide exposure and the subsequent risk of endometrial, ovarian, and breast cancers in 2007 (11); and risk of renal cell bladder and prostate cancers in 2008 (2424\. Hogervorst JG, Schouten LJ, Konings EJ, Goldbohm RA, and van den Brandt PA: Dietary acrylamide intake and the risk of renal cell, bladder, and prostate cancer. Am J Clin Nutr 87, 1428–1438, 2008.  
View all references). Because cigarette smoke is an important source for acrylamide exposure, data on smoking status (both past and current), duration of smoking, and number of cigarettes smoked per day were included in the models (1111\. Hogervorst JG, Schouten LJ, Konings EJ, Goldbohm RA, and van den Brandt PA: A prospective study of dietary acrylamide intake and the risk of endometrial, ovarian, and breast cancer. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev 16, 2304–2313, 2007.

View all references). In addition, separate analyses were performed for a sub-group of never-smokers (1111\. Hogervorst JG, Schouten LJ, Konings EJ, Goldbohm RA, and van den Brandt PA: A prospective study of dietary acrylamide intake and the risk of endometrial, ovarian, and breast cancer. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev 16, 2304–2313, 2007.  
View all references). The analysis included 221 endometrial, 195 ovarian, and 1350 breast cancer cases (11). Highest vs. lowest quintiles of dietary acrylamide exposure was significantly associated with increased ovarian cancer risk (HR = 1.78; 95% CI: 1.10–2.88) (11), and the association among never-smokers was also statistically significant (HR = 2.22; 95% CI: 1.20–4.08) (11). In addition, increased risk for endometrial cancer was also observed among a sub-group of never-smokers (HR = 1.99; 95% CI: 1.12–3.52) (11).

Nevertheless, dietary acrylamide exposure (highest vs. lowest quintiles) was significantly associated with renal cell cancer (HR = 1.59; 95% CI: 1.09–2.30) (24), but not in never-smokers (24). The renal cell cancer association was significant in a model in which acrylamide exposure was used as a continuous variable for men and women, both combined and separately (24). This is the first study to report an increased risk of dietary acrylamide and renal cell cancer (24). Previously, studies by Mucci et al. (22,25) and Pelucchi et al. (26) did not observe such associations (Fig. 3A).

Dietary acrylamide exposure was not associated with breast, prostate, bladder, or endometrial cancers (11,24). Hogervorst et al. speculated that acrylamide might be responsible for hormonally driven cancers (2727\. Hogervorst JG, Schouten LJ, Konings EJ, Goldbohm RA, and van den Brandt PA. Lung cancer risk in relation to dietary acrylamide intake. J Natl Cancer Inst 101, 651–662, 2009.  
View all references). However, the lack of associations in breast cancer, the most prevalent type of cancer among women, and prostate cancer among men raises doubt for this theory (Fig. 4).

Smokers have been previously shown to have nearly five times more HbAA adducts as compared to nonsmokers (31). The important question to address would be the challenges of separating the effects of smoking from dietary exposures and the lack of such biomarkers that can distinguish acrylamide from dietary vs. smoking exposure remains an area for further research and exploration.

Hogervorst et al. (2828\. Hogervorst JG, Schouten LJ, Konings EJ, Goldbohm RA, and van den Brandt PA: Dietary acrylamide intake and brain cancer risk. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev 18, 1663–1666, 2009.

The authors reported a total of 259 cases of primary brain cancer (2828\. Hogervorst JG, Schouten LJ, Konings EJ, Goldbohm RA, and van den Brandt PA: Dietary acrylamide intake and brain cancer risk.

View all references), with 205 being microscopically identifiable after 16.3 yr of follow-up (28). Dietary acrylamide exposure was 21.8 ± 12.1 and 22.1 ± 12.9 (mean ± SD) μg/day among subcohort participants and cases, respectively (28). Dietary acrylamide analyzed as continuous, or tertiles, or quintiles was not associated with brain cancer (28). After exclusions for cancer diagnosis at baseline, a total of 216 cases were included in the analyses. Dietary acrylamide exposure was not associated with total brain cancer, histological subtypes of astrocytic glioma, or high-grade astrocytic glioma (2828\. Hogervorst JG, Schouten LJ, Konings EJ, Goldbohm RA, and van den Brandt PA: Dietary acrylamide intake and brain cancer risk. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev 18, 1663–1666, 2009.

In 2009, Schouten et al. (6363\. Schouten LJ, Hogervorst JG, Konings EJ, Goldbohm RA, and van den Brandt PA: Dietary acrylamide intake and the risk of head-neck and thyroid cancers: results from the Netherlands Cohort Study. Am J Epidemiol 170, 873–884, 2009.  
View all references) analyzed the NLCSDC subcohort data of the 2022 participants for evaluating associations between dietary acrylamide exposure and risk of head-neck and thyroid cancer (63). Mean dietary acrylamide intake estimated from baseline FFQ among subcohort was 22.5 ± 12.2 μ g/day. There were no significant associations between dietary acrylamide and overall head and neck or thyroid cancers (HR = 0.74; 95% CI: 0.4–1.15 among men, and HR = 1.01; 95% CI: 0.53–1.93 among women) (63). However, increased risk for oral cavity was observed for a sub-group of nonsmoker women (_n_ = 12) (HR = 1.28; 95% CI: 1.01–1.62 per 10 μg intake/day) (63).

Interestingly, a statistically significant decreased risk for head and neck cancer was observed among a sub-group of nonsmoker men (_n_ = 63) in the highest tertile of acrylamide exposure (HR = 0.45; 95% CI: 0.21–0.94) (63) (Fig. 3B). The authors reported these results as a possible chance finding because of small number of nonsmoker cases (63). Future prospective studies with substantial number of nonsmoker cases are needed to understand the influence of gender, and smoking status, on such associations.

Recently, Bongers et al. (6464\. Bongers ML, Hogervorst JG, Schouten LJ, Goldbohm RA, Schouten HC, et al. Dietary acrylamide intake and the risk of lymphatic malignancies: the Netherlands Cohort Study on diet and cancer. PLoS One7(62012.  
View all references) analyzed the associations between dietary acrylamide exposure and risk of lymphatic malignancies from the NLCSDC cohort. The baseline FFQ data was analyzed for estimating the mean dietary acrylamide exposure, and was 23 ± 12 μg/day among the subcohort, and ranged between 21± 11 μg/day to 26 ± 16 μg/day among the cases (64). There were 1233 microscopically confirmed lymphatic malignancies had occurred. Dietary acrylamide was not associated with diffuse large cell lymphoma. Dietary acrylamide exposure modeled as continuous variable, there were increased risk for multiple myeloma (HR = 1.14; 95% CI: 1.01–1.27) and follicular lymphoma (HR = 1.28; 95% CI: 1.38–2.85) among men per 10 μg acrylamide exposure per day (6464\.

PLoS One7(62012.  
View all references). In addition, among nonsmoking men there were significant interactions observed for increased associations between dietary acrylamide and multiple myeloma risk among men with highest alcohol intake (HR = 2.28; 95% CI: 1.28–4.06) (64). Among women, there were no statistically significant associations observed between dietary acrylamide exposure and lymphatic malignancies. Interesting, for dietary acrylamide as a continuous variable, a decreased risk for chronic lymphocytic leukemia was observed for both men and women (6464\. Bongers ML, Hogervorst JG, Schouten LJ, Goldbohm RA, Schouten HC, et al. Dietary acrylamide intake and the risk of lymphatic malignancies: the Netherlands Cohort Study on diet and cancer. PLoS One7(62012.  

Given that the baseline FFQ were analyzed to estimate the dietary acrylamide exposure, and the question of whether it would be the most relevant exposure after 11–13 yr of follow-up remains unanswered. It is possible that dietary changes were not same across the cohort members and any potential changes in dietary intakes that may have led to changes to acrylamide exposure might not have been accurately captured. Some subjects in the subcohort analyses might have been potentially misclassified. Therefore, the results obtained from the above reported cohort studies should be interpreted with caution.

### Case-Cohort Study from U.K. Women's Cohort

U.K. Women's Cohort is a large prospective study of 35,372 women with detailed baseline validated FFQ that comprised 217 food items (6565\. Cade JE, Burley VJ, and Greenwood DC: The UK Women's Cohort Study: comparison of vegetarians, fish-eaters and meat-eaters. Public Health Nutr 7, 871–878, 2004.  
View all references). A total of 1084 breast cancer incidences had occurred during the median follow-up time of 11 yr. Recently, Burley et al. (6666\. Burley VJ, Greenwood DC, Hepworth SJ, Fraser LK, de Kok TM, et al.: Dietary acrylamide intake and risk of breast cancer in the UK women's cohort. Br J Cancer 103, 1749–1754, 2010.

Burley VJ, Greenwood DC, Hepworth SJ, Fraser LK, de Kok TM, et al.: Dietary acrylamide intake and risk of breast cancer in the UK women's cohort. Br J Cancer 103, 1749–1754, 2010.  
View all references). Overall, dietary acrylamide exposure (highest vs. lowest quintile) was not associated with breast cancer risk (OR = 1.16; 95% CI: 0.88–1.52) (66), which is in agreement with other prospective cohort (13;16;19;56), and case-cohort (11;17) studies that have reported no associations for dietary acrylamide and increased risk of breast cancer. Stratified analysis by menopausal status revealed no significant associations for postmenopausal women (OR = 0.97; 95% CI: 0.68–1.39) (66), or premenopausal women (OR = 1.47; 95% CI: 0.96–2.27) (66). However, a significant increased risk for increasing acrylamide exposure per 10 μg/day among premenopausal women was observed (OR = 1.18; 95% CI: 1.05–1.34) (66). Further sub-group analyses among never-smokers showed no association between dietary acrylamide and overall breast cancer or by menopausal status (66).

Olesen et al. (29) analyzed the association between HbAA adducts and postmenopausal breast cancer among 374 breast cancer cases and matched 374 controls (2929\. Olesen PT, Olsen A, Frandsen H, Frederiksen K, Overvad K, et al.: Acrylamide exposure and incidence of breast cancer among postmenopausal women in the Danish Diet, Cancer and Health Study.

View all references) from the Danish Diet, Cancer and Health Cohort. The prospective cohort was designed to study etiologic role of diet on cancer risk among women ages between 50–64 yr from Denmark. At the baseline lifestyle and dietary data were collected using questionnaires, and blood samples were collected (6767\. Tjonneland A, Olsen A, Boll K, Stripp C, Christensen J, et al.: Study design, exposure variables, and socioeconomic determinants of participation in Diet, Cancer and Health: a population-based prospective cohort study of 57,053 men and women in Denmark. Scand J Public Health 35, 432–441, 2007.  
View all references). In the nested-case control study, tobacco smoke was the major source for acrylamide exposure, and smokers had elevated levels of HbAA (3.8 times higher) and HbGA (2.8 times higher) adduct compared to non-smokers (29). Overall, the incidence rate ratio for associations between the adducts levels and breast cancer was not statistically significant (IRR = 1.5; 95% CI: 0.8–3.0) (29). In addition, in a separate analyses of never-smokers (64 cases and 64 controls), no significant associations were observed for HbAA adduct levels and total breast cancer (IRR = 2.7; 95% CI: 0.3–24) (29). In the fully adjusted model, receptor specific analyses revealed significant increased risk for ER+ breast cancer among women with highest adduct levels as compared to the lowest adduct levels (IRR = 2.7; 95% CI: 1.1–6.6) (29). Future studies with follow-up blood samples drawn at multiple time-points to allow analyses for any seasonal variations, changes in the diet, and lifestyle factors that could potentially influence adduct levels are needed.

Recently, Xie et al. (68), analyzed the association between dietary acrylamide exposure measured as HbAA and HbGA and ovarian cancer risk among 263 cases and matched 526 controls from the Nurses’ Health Study and Nurses’ Health Study II. The median acrylamide and glycidamide (total acrylamide) adducts among cases and control was 112.6 and 113.9 pmol/g hemoglobin, respectively. There were no statistically significant associations for ovarian cancer when compared to women with total acrylamide adducts &lt;99 pmol/g hemoglobin to those with &gt;99–134.1 pmol/g hemoglobin (RR = 0.83; 95% CI: 0.56–1.24) or with those total acrylamide adducts levels ≥134.1 pmol/g hemoglobin (RR = 0.79; 95% CI: 0.50–1.24) (68). In addition, adduct levels were analyzed separately. No associations were observed for glycidmide adducts (_P_ trend = 0.19), but a borderline significant inverse association was observed for acrylamide adducts (_P_ trend = 0.05) (68).

## EVIDENCE FROM POPULATION-BASED CASE-CONTROL STUDIES

### Jump to section

From our literature search, we located three population-based case-control studies on acrylamide and cancer (Table 3). In a population-based Swedish case-control study, Mucci et al. (22) included 591 large bowel, 263 kidney, 133 bladder cancer cases, and 538 controls that were both age and gender matched (22). The study was a secondary analysis from a parent population-based case-control study of heterocyclic amines and cancer (69). Dietary data were collected by using a semiquantitative FFQ that comprised a total of 188 food items. The main focus of the questionnaire was to capture foods rich in heterocyclic amines; for example, 69 meat dishes were included, along with pictures that showed the browning of cooked food at different temperatures prepared by different cooking methods (frying, roasting, or broiling) (70). There were no associations between dietary acrylamide exposure and risk of large bowel (OR = 0.6; 95% CI: 0.4–1.0) (22), kidney (OR = 0.8; 95% CI: 0.5–1.5) (22), or bladder cancer (OR = 0.8; 95% CI: 0.4–1.7) (22). Given that the study was a secondary data analyses from the heterocyclic amines and cancer study, it is possible that foods that would account for most of the acrylamide load for this population were not included in the questionnaire. Hagmar (71) published a brief commentary about the results of the large bowel, kidney, and bladder cancer study by Mucci et al. (22), and urged readers to view the null results along with possible weaknesses of the case-control study design and possible exposure misclassification (71).

Mucci et al. (25) analyzed the data from the Diet and Renal Cell Cancer Population-Based Case-Control Study (7272\. Lindblad P, Wolk A, Bergstrom R, and Adami HO: Diet and risk of renal cell cancer: a population-based case-control study. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev 6, 215–223, 1997.

View all references). Trained interviewers assessed the dietary acrylamide exposure among 379 cases and 353 controls using a structured questionnaire, along with information on 11 food items with potentially higher acrylamide content (2525\. Mucci LA, Lindblad P, Steineck G, and Adami HO: Dietary acrylamide and risk of renal cell cancer. Int J Cancer 109, 774–776, 2004.

Wilson et al. (30) recruited cases of prostate cancer from the Cancer of the Prostate in Sweden study (73), to evaluate acrylamide intake and prostate cancer risk by measuring HbAA levels as a biomarker of exposure in addition to questionnaire-measured exposure (3030\. Wilson KM, Balter K, Adami HO, Gronberg H, Vikstrom AC, et al.: Acrylamide exposure measured by food frequency questionnaire and hemoglobin adduct levels and prostate cancer risk in the Cancer of the Prostate in Sweden Study. Int J Cancer 124, 2384–2390, 2009.  
View all references). The dietary questionnaire included 261 food items (3030\. Wilson KM, Balter K, Adami HO, Gronberg H, Vikstrom AC, et al.: Acrylamide exposure measured by food frequency questionnaire and hemoglobin adduct levels and prostate cancer risk in the Cancer of the Prostate in Sweden Study. Int J Cancer 124, 2384–2390, 2009.

Int J Cancer 124, 2384–2390, 2009.  
View all references). The final analysis included 1489 cases and 1111 controls, and the mean acrylamide exposure among cases and controls were 43.8 and 44.5 μg/day, respectively (30). Acrylamide exposure measured by FFQs or HbAA levels was not associated with overall or specific subtypes of prostate cancer (3030\. Wilson KM, Balter K, Adami HO, Gronberg H, Vikstrom AC, et al.: Acrylamide exposure measured by food frequency questionnaire and hemoglobin adduct levels and prostate cancer risk in the Cancer of the Prostate in Sweden Study. Int J Cancer 124, 2384–2390, 2009.  
View all references). The acrylamide exposures measured by FFQ was only moderately associated with the HbAA adduct (among controls r = 0.35; 95% CI: 0.21–0.45, and among cases r = 0.15; 95% CI: 0.00–0.30) (30), which questi-ons the usefulness of FFQ-based acrylamide exposure estimations (30).

Lin et al. (74) analyzed data from the Symptomatic Gastroesophageal Reflux as a Risk Factor for Esophageal Adenocarcinoma (75), a population-based case-control study from Sweden to evaluate the associations between dietary acrylamide exposure and esophageal cancer risk among 618 cases and 820 controls (7474\.

View all references). Data on dietary habits from the previous 20 yr were collected using FFQs, and acrylamide exposure was assessed by the consumption of nine food items: French fries, fried potatoes, baked potatoes, bread (soft, coarse, and crisp), biscuits, cookies, and coffee. Sub-group analyses were performed for overweight and obese subjects (7474\. Lin Y, Lagergren J, and Lu Y: Dietary acrylamide intake and risk of esophageal cancer in a population-based case-control study in Sweden. Int J Cancer 128, 676–681, 2011.  
View all references). Dietary acrylamide exposure was significantly associated with an increased risk for overall esophageal cancers (OR = 1.23; 95% CI: 1.02–1.75) (74), and the risk estimates increased among obese and overweight subjects (OR = 1.88; 95% CI: 1.06–3.34) (74).

Pelucchi C, Franceschi S, Levi F, Trichopoulos D, Bosetti C, et al.: Fried potatoes and human cancer. Int J Cancer 105, 558–560, 2003.  
View all references). Dietary data were collected using the same questionnaire and demographic information across these studies, and data on smoking and alcohol consumption were also collected (7676\. Pelucchi C, Franceschi S, Levi F, Trichopoulos D, Bosetti C, et al.: Fried potatoes and human cancer. Int J Cancer 105, 558–560, 2003.  
View all references). The combined analysis of all of these studies did not show any significant association between fried/baked potatoes intake and cancers of the oral cavity and pharyngeal (OR = 1.1; 95% CI: 0.9–1.4) (76), esophageal (OR = 1.0; 95% CI: 0.7–1.5) (76), laryngeal (OR = 1.1; 95% CI: 0.8–1.5) (76), colon (OR = 0.8; 95% CI: 0.7–1.0) (76), ovarian (OR = 1.1; 95% CI: 0.9–1.3) (76), or breast (OR = 0.9; 95% CI: 0.8–1.1) (76). An inverse association was observed between fried potato intake and large bowel cancer (OR = 0.8; 95% CI: 0.7–1.0) (76), and the authors reported that this finding was likely due to chance alone (76). Data were adjusted for smoking status. From 1992 to 2004, Pelucchi et al. conducted a similar hospital-based study of dietary acrylamide and renal cell cancer in four Italian regions among 767 histologically confirmed renal cancer cases and 1574 controls (26). Dietary acrylamide exposures were estimated by an interview-based 78-item FFQ, which included commonly consumed food items with higher acrylamide contents such as baked potatoes and other bakery products. Similar to the previous results (2525\. Mucci LA, Lindblad P, Steineck G, and Adami HO: Dietary acrylamide and risk of renal cell cancer. Int J Cancer 109, 774–776, 2004.  
View all references), no association was observed between highest vs. lowest quartile of dietary acrylamide exposure and renal cell cancer (OR = 1.20, 95% CI: 0.88–1.63) (26). 

Pelucchi et al. (83) evaluated the associations between dietary acrylamide exposure and pancreatic cancer risk in a hospital based case-control study among 326 cases and 652 age and sex matched controls in northern Italy. The acrylamide exposure estimated from the 78-item FFQ and was 33.52 ± 17.42 μg/day among cases, and 32.20 ± 19.80 μg/day among controls. There were no associations observed between dietary acrylamide exposure (highest vs. lowest quintile) and pancreatic cancer (OR = 1.49; 95% CI: 0.83–2.70) (83). In addition, there were no statistically significant associations when dietary acrylamide exposure was modeled as continuous variable (OR = 1.01; 95% CI: 0.92–1.10) (83).

## DATA GAPS

### Jump to section

Dietary patterns and different food sources of acrylamide contribute to varying dietary acrylamide exposure among different populations. Large variations have been reported in acrylamide content among different brands of similar food items, and such data is not being collected on the FFQ. Although, FFQs are a useful tool for assessing usual dietary pattern they were not designed for capturing chemical exposures. Information such as recipe information, browning of food, length of cooking, micronutrient composition of the raw food, storage of food, and so on is not being collected but is highly important for assessing acrylamide exposures. The measurement errors resulting from above discussed factors have potential for misclassification for ranking individuals for high vs. low acrylamide exposure. The subsequent lack of reproducibility of epidemiological results points toward the utmost need for developing better methods to capture true intake, which would include absorption and metabolism assessments and would be capable of separating dietary exposure from other sources. The studies that estimated acrylamide using FFQ as well as acrylamide adducts, reported a lack of strong correlation between FFQ and HbAA, suggesting that these measurements represent exposures over the different time interval lengths. The HbAA measures the exposure from the last 120 days, and even by assuming that the FFQ is adequately capturing long-term dietary acrylamide exposures, the correlation could be influenced by seasonality, recent exposures, and so on. For chronic disease endpoints such as cancer, the goal is to estimate long-term exposure as compared to recent ones. So, one could potentially estimate the HbAA pattern by measuring repeated HbAA adducts over a long period of time will be highly useful (one time point just gives us a snapshot, not the pattern).

In the absence of food-specific biomarkers, controlled feeding studies among healthy volunteers to evaluate the changes in the HbAA adduct levels by changing the dietary acrylamide intake doses are lacking. Such studies would provide the evidence about the maximal reduction of acrylamide that could be achieved by reducing the food-related acrylamide intake and would also provide evidence of the proportion of acrylamide exposure from other environmental sources.

Foods that are sources of acrylamide also contain a range of nutrients and most of these foods are high-energy sources, resulting in a high correlation between energy, nutrients, and acrylamide. High-energy intake itself is associated with obesity and the increased the risk of several cancers, as well as exposure to acrylamide. Most of the studies included in this review used several statistical approaches to reduce the effect of energy on the association between acrylamide and cancer. Future studies that compare people with balanced diet vs. more Western-type diet may provide additional insight into associations between dietary acrylamide and cancer. Because smoking is an established source of acrylamide exposure, the majority of the reviewed studies adjusted for smoking status and included separate models for never-smokers. Future studies of dietary acrylamide that accounts for secondhand smoke exposure and with large sample size of never-smokers are needed.

Although a number of studies have reported disparity in acrylamide intake, with children being at the highest exposure level, none of the studies to date has evaluated childhood exposure to acrylamide as a potential risk factor for cancer later in life. It is unknown if the magnitude of associations would be different for populations who are generally considered vulnerable such as older adults, and populations who are at higher risk for cancer due to weak immune response and other underlying diseases.

## CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS

### Jump to section

In the reviewed epidemiologic studies, the dietary acrylamide exposure assessment has been inadequate leading to potential misclassification. In addition, the case-control studies have reported nearly same magnitude of dietary acrylamide exposures among both cases and controls. For disease endpoint such as cancer, the exposure assessment methods that could capture the long-term exposures are highly recommended. However, majority of the reviewed epidemiologic studies have rather estimated one-time point exposures from the baseline FFQs with the huge assumption that the dietary acrylamide content as well as the individual exposures over time remained constant. This is especially worrisome since a number of new food items are introduced in the market each year. In addition, food consumption patterns can be influenced by factors such as seasonality, prices, sales, as well as social factors such as holidays resulting in potential changes in dietary acrylamide exposure.

The future studies with improved dietary acrylamide exposure assessment by including longitudinal HbAA adducts every 3 mo, along with improved tools of dietary assessment are highly encouraged (Fig. 5). Until we have the improved exposure assessment methods incorporated, the epidemiologic studies assessing relationship between dietary acrylamide and cancer will not have any meaningful interpretations.
