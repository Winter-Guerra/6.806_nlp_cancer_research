# Levels of perfluorinated compounds in raw and cooked Mediterranean finfish and shellfish

## Abstract

Perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) were analyzed in several species of small Mediterranean fish and shellfish, all of which are popular in Greek diet. Analysis was conducted in raw samples and in samples cooked by the two ways preferred in Greek cuisine, i.e. fried in olive oil and grilled. PFCs above the detection limit were found in all raw samples except sardine, mussel and squid. The predominant PFC was PFOS (perfluorooctane sulfonate), the highest concentration of which was measured in picarel (20.4 ng g−1 fresh weight). The PFOS values for the rest of the samples were between &lt;LOD and 5.66 ng g−1 fw. The concentrations of the detected PFCs were in most cases higher after frying or grilling, this increase being statistically significant. Based on these results, the Tolerable Daily Intake for PFOS and PFOA (perfluorooctanoic acid) through consumption of fish and seafood was well below the values proposed by EFSA.
