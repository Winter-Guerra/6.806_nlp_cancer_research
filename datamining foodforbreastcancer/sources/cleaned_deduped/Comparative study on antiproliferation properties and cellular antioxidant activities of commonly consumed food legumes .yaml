  The aims of this work were to compare health promoting effects of commonly consumed
  food legumes in terms of cancer cell proliferation inhibitory effects and cellular
  antioxidant activities. The CAA was evaluated by fluorescence microplate reader
  based on in vitro animal cell cultivation. Antiproliferative properties were assayed
  by MTT method using in vitro cell culture system. Phytochemicals  and chemical antioxidant
  activities ) were also determined for comparison purposes. The results showed that
  different types of legumes possessed considerable variations in their phytochemicals,
  as well as chemical and cellular antioxidant activities. Adzuki bean exhibited the
  strongest antiproliferative properties in a dose-dependent manner against all digestive
  system cancer cell lines, ovary cancer cell SK-OV-3 and breast cancer cell MCF-7
  among all legumes tested. Black soybean exhibited the highest saponin, phytic acid
  content, PRSC values, and the strongest CAA values. These results indicate that
  commonly consumed food legumes may serve as an excellent dietary source of natural
  antioxidants for health promotion and cancer prevention.'
