  Activities of an Anthocyanin-Rich Extract From Black Rice Against Breast Cancer
  Cells In Vitro and In Vivo.md
text: '


  Anthocyanins widely present in human diet and have a variety of health effects.
  This study investigates the anticancer effects of an anthocyanin-rich extract from
  black rice  on breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. AEBR reduced the viability
  of breast cancer cell lines MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, and MDA-MB-453  and induced apoptosis
  in MDA-MB-453 cells via the intrinsic pathway in vitro by activating caspase cascade,
  cleaving poly  polymerase, depolarizing mitochondrial membrane potential, and releasing
  cytochrome C. Oral administration of AEBR  to BALB/c nude mice bearing MDA-MB-453
  cell xenografts significantly suppressed tumor growth and angiogenesis by suppressing
  the expression of angiogenesis factors MMP-9, MMP-2, and uPA in tumor tissue. Altogether,
  this study suggests the anticancer effects of AEBR against human breast cancer cells
  in vitro and in vivo by inducing apoptosis and suppressing angiogenesis.'
