  inhibits tumour growth and metastases dissemination in ovariectomised nude mice

text: '


  Oleuropein, the precursor of olive oil secoiridoids, has been shown to possess a
  strong in vitro anti-cancer activity. The in vivo effect of OL on a BC animal model
  consisting of MCF-7 cells xenograft growth in ovariectomised nude mice was investigated.
  After subcutaneous implantation of 17- E2 pellet, BC xenografts were established
  by injection of MCF-7 cells into the mouse mammary fat pads. Animals, divided into
  two groups, were fed a basal diet  and an OL enriched diet. Animals in the BD group
  lost weight more consistent than those of the OLD group while the MCF-7 xenograft
  growth was faster in the BD group compared to the OLD group. Tumour volume reached
  about 1300 mm3 28 and 35 days after MCF-7 cells injection in the BD and OLD groups,
  respectively. At these times the animals were sacrificed for the evaluation of pulmonary
  metastases. OL prevented both peripulmonary and parenchyma lung metastases in a
  highly significant manner. These data demonstrate for the first time a strong in
  vivo chemopreventive activity of OL on BC.'
