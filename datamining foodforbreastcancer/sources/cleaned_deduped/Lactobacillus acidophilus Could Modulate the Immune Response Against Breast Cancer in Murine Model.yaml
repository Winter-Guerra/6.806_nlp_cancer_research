  acidophilus Could Modulate the Immune Response Against Breast Cancer in Murine Model.md
text: "\n\nCancer immune-therapy is an interesting avenue of studying the effects
  of deviating immune system responses to achieve the desired result. Lactobacilli
  are inhabitants of the GI tract which have shown beneficial health effects on various
  ailments including malignancies. Their mechanisms of action comprise a very intense
  area of research. In this study we evaluated the immunomodulatory effects of Lactobacillus
  acidophilus in in vivo model of breast cancer. Lactobacillus acidophilus  was isolated
  from traditional home-made yogurt and also from neonatal stool by aerobic overnight
  culture at 37C in MRS broth. Delayed Type Hypersensitivity  assay was performed
  to find the best immunostimulant dose. 4T1 tumour bearing mice were treated with
  2  108 cfu of isolated L. acidophilus and 20 mg/kg Cyclophosphamide for 15 consecutive
  days. Tumour volume was measured using a digital vernier calliper. Lymphocyte proliferation
  was done using MTT proliferation assay. Production of IFN, IL-4 and TGF- from cultured
  Splenocytes was assessed in the presence of purified tumour antigen. According to
  results administration of L.a induced a significant decrease in tumour growth pattern.
  Significant alterations in splenocyte production of IFN-, IL-4 and TGf-  and also
  lymphocyte proliferation in L.a treated animals was evident. This study indicated
  that oral administration of L.a is able to alter the cytokine production in tumour
  bearing mice into a Th1 protective pattern, favourable to anti tumour immunity.
  Reduced tumour growth rate and increased lymphocyte proliferation are also thus
  supportive. Further studies are required to elucidate the exact mechanism by which
  local actions of probiotics affect the systemic immune responses against transformed
  cells.\n\nLactobacillus acidophilus 4T1 breast cancer cell line immune modulation
  cyclophosphamide\n\nBreast cancer is one of the leading causes of death in women
  around the world with a very high degree of mortality and morbidity. Intensive researches
  in this area are being conducted. Still many aspects of this illness are obscure.
  Conventional treatments use cytotoxic drugs which have high levels of side effects,
  affecting the patients quality of life. Therefore todays pharmacology is looking
  into treatments with low side effects and maximum efficiency. Immune-therapy is
  an interesting avenue of studying the effects of deviating immune system responses
  to achieve the desired result. Many immune modulations have been carried out by
  numerous studies to shift the responses from a Th2 pattern to a Th1, which is believed
  to be the principle causative of impaired response to malignancies. Many clinical
  and experimental studies have focused on DC based vaccine strategies, adoptive transfer
  of effector T cells, DNA vaccines containing designer cytokines and antigens  and
  many more. All of these strategies are focusing on one thing that is built naturally
  through active immune responses. Many microorganisms initiate a strong Th1 response
  via various molecular patterns.\n\nProbiotics are inhabitants of the GI tract possessing
  numerous health benefits. An appropriate definition to human nutrition has been
  outlined by Salminen et al.  describing a probiotic as, a live microbial food ingredient
  that is beneficial to health. Many probiotics are members of the genera Lactobacillus
  and Bifidobacteria. Many studies have outlined the beneficial effects of probiotics
  on various ailments such as food allergy, inflammatory bowel disease  and Ulcerative
  Colitis. Probiotics exert their modulatory actions by different mechanisms. These
  include anti-genotoxicity and Inhibition of colonic enzyme activity which reduces
  the harmful effects of carcinogens which are activated via enzymatic actions in
  the colon, control of the growth of potentially harmful bacteria, interaction with
  colonocytes which results in enhanced homeostasis and the integrity of epithelial
  barrier through increasing the production of Zonula Occludens-2, immune system stimulation
  which is measured by increases in secretory and inflammatory responses in animals
  and man and production of physiologically active metabolites including short chain
  fatty acids which induce differentiation and apoptosis in vitro studies. The immunomodulatory
  actions of probiotic are a very intense area of research. Many studies have utilised
  this effect for deviating the responses of immune system into the pattern of choice.
  It has been shown that probiotics are able to attach to entrocytes and be up taken
  by dendritic cells  beneath the epithelial barrier and the M cells in Peyer Patches.
  In vitro, T cell interactions with Lactobacillus rhamnosus primed DCs show less
  proliferation and production of cytokines. This could be an indication for generation
  of regulatory DCs in the gut. How these mechanisms might affect systemic responses
  to cancer progression is to be investigated. With evidences at hand in their ability
  to shift the responses to Th1, it is postulated that the probiotics may aid the
  immune system against cancer. Therefore in this study we evaluated the immunomodulatory
  effects of probiotics in in vivo model of breast cancer.\n\n810 week old Balb/C
  inbred female mice  were used, housed five to a cage with access to autoclaved standard
  mouse chow at libitum.. All animals received humane care. The animal protocol was
  reviewed and approved by the Animal Care and Research Committee of the Tarbiat Modares
  University.\n\nLactobacillus acidophilus strain was used in this study as a probiotic
  that was isolated from traditional home-made yogurt as standard bacteria  and also
  from neonatal stool  as a normal flora of GI. Before administration, L. acidophilus
  strain was grown aerobically overnight at 37C in DeMan, Rogosa, Sharpe, Oxoid  broth.
  The next day, bacteria were harvested with centrifugation, washed twice in sterile
  phosphate buffered saline, and adjusted to a cell density of 2  108 colony-forming
  units  per millilitre.\n\nTwenty eight to ten week old mice were sensitised subcutaneously
  \ with109 sheep red blood cells  and divided randomly into 4 groups of five. 3 groups
  were treated daily with 0.1 mL of the L.a solution containing 108, 2  108 and 3
  \ 108 cfu via the orogastric route by a feeding canula for a 7 day period. The remaining
  group  were treated with phosphate buffer saline in the same route, volume, and
  time. On day 8 of sensitization, the sensitized animals were challenged with 108
  sRBCs injected subcutaneously on the left hind foot pad. The increase in the foot
  pad thickness was measured 24, 48, and 72 h after the antigen challenged by vernier
  calliper. Each measurement was repeated twice. The results were expressed as the
  mean percentage increase in the foot pad thickness. The results were calculated
  according to the following formula.\n\n$$ \\frac{{left\\,foot\\,pad\\,challenged\\,with\\,sRBC
  - right\\,foot\\,pad}}{{Right\\,foot\\,pad}} \\times 100 = \\% \\,increase\\,in\\,swelling
  $$\n\n46 week old Balb/c mice were transplanted in the left flank with 7  105106
  cells of 4T1 breast cancer cell line. The tumors developed on the 8th day, after
  which we started therapy at the 11th day. The animals were sacrificed at the 30th
  day. 4T1 breast cancer cell line develops in Balb/c mice. 4T1 mammary carcinoma
  derived from Balb/c mice shares many characteristics with naturally occurring human
  breast cancer. By the time the primary tumor is palpable, 4T1 tumor cells have spontaneously
  spread to various distant organs. Surgical removal of palpable primary tumors from
  the mammary glands does not affect the growth of distal metastases and pulmonary
  metastasis is the major cause of death in 4T1-bearing mice. For these reasons, 4T1
  in the immune-competent and syngeneic Balb/c mouse is recognized as a most challenging
  breast tumor model in which to evaluate the efficacy of novel immunotherapeutics.\n\nThe
  tumours grew for approximately 8 days, after which animals were divided into groups
  of 5 mice. Experimental groups were treated with 1) 2  108 cfu L. acidophilus isolated
  from yogurt and 2) neonatal stool and 3) injected intraperitoneally with 20 mg/kg
  Cyclophosphamide. PBS was used as control in a total volume of 0.2 ml. Treatment
  was carried out for 15 consecutive days.\n\nTumour volume was measured using a digital
  vernier calliper  and calculated using the following formula:\n\nAccording to the
  results from DTH, tumour-bearing mice were treated with 2  108 cfu L. acidophilus
  isolated from yogurt, stool and 20 mg/kg CYC and PBS as control for 15 consecutive
  days. On day 16 blood samples were drawn and mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation
  and spleen was resected. Spleen was removed under sterile conditions and suspended
  in PBS containing 2 % FBS. RBCs were lysed with lysis buffer. Single-cell suspension
  was prepared and adjusted to 3  106 cells/ml in RPMI 1640  supplemented with 5 %
  FCS, 4 mM L-glutamine, 25 mM HEPES, 0.1 mM non-essential amino acid, 1 mM sodium
  pyrovate, 50 m 2ME. The number of isolated cells from the spleen was in a similar
  range among different samples, and the viability of cells was an average of 95 %
  according to trypan blue staining.\n\nTumours cell line suspension was washed with
  saline and prepared. Tumour suspension was then subjected to three rounds of freezing
  \ and thawing. It was then sonicated with a power of 4 W for 30 s followed by a
  30-s incubation period for three consecutive times. In order to inhibit serine proteases,
  1 mMPhenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride  was added to the cell lysates. Finally, the extract
  was dialysed and filtered. Protein concentration of the extract was determined using
  micro Bradford method and then stored in 20 until use.\n\nSplenic MNCs were cultured
  in RPMI 1640. Proliferation assay was done using MTT proliferation assay protocol.
  Briefly, 100 l of cell suspensions was dispensed in96 well flat bottom micro plates.
  6 wells were considered for each sample. 20 l of tumour antigen was added to three
  wells of each sample. Plates were incubated in 37C. After 48 h at 37  C and 90 %
  humidity and 5 % CO2 cells were labeled with 5 l/ml MTT. Cells were reincubated
  for additional 4 h at 37C. Labeling medium was removed using 10 min centrifuge  at
  300 g. Cells were fixed using 100 l DMSO solution and stored at room temperature
  for 5 min. Absorbance of the samples was measured using ELISA reader at 540 nm.
  Results are presented as stimulation index, using the following formula:\n\n$$ {{{OD\\,of\\,splenocyte
  + tumour\\,Ag}} \\left/ {{OD\\,of\\,splenocyte - tumour\\,Ag}} \\right.} $$\n\nIsolated
  spleen MNCs were cultured in 24 well plates  as mentioned above. 20 l of purified
  tumour antigen was added to each and 72 h after plates were centrifuged  and supernatants
  were collected and were kept at 70C until use. IFN, IL-4 and TGF- concentrations
  were measured using R&amp;D DuoSet ELISA Development kit according to the manufacturers
  protocols. Each sample was analyzed in duplicates.\n\nEach experiment was performed
  in duplicate or triplicate. The results are expressed as mean  SE. The P-value of
  0.05 was considered the statistical significance of the results using SPSS software
  version 19.\n\nTreatment with L.a has shown that it has the ability to augment the
  cellular immune responses. Thus in this matter, to assess the overall effect of
  L.a on the cellular immune system, three doses were administered and compared. As
  seen in Fig. 1, it is evident that the three different doses of L.a showed distinct
  patterns of response. In 24 h intervals after left foot pad challenge, swelling
  was measured as in difference between left and right foot pad expressed in percentage.
  After 72 h, mice treated with 2  108 cfu of L. Acidophilus responded significantly
  to antigen challenge as compared to doses of 108 and 3  108.\n\nDelayed type responses
  in mice  pre-sensitized with sheep RBC is shown as the percentage of increased swelling
  in left foot pad compared to right food pad as control. Data is presented as mean
  \ SEM. Results clearly showed that 2  108 cfu of L.a has a greater influence on
  immune response  con = control\n\nThe volume of tumours was measured throughout
  the treatment using a digital vernier calliper. The pattern of tumour growth is
  shown in Fig. 2. CYC was used as an approved treatment and as positive control in
  this study. As expected, it showed significant control of tumour growth compared
  to control mice treated with PBS and other treatment groups. However efficient control
  of tumour growth was observed in administration of L.a \n\nTumour growth was measured
  every five days by digital calliper. Tumour volume was calculated using the formula
  described. Data represent the means  SEM for five animals per group. SD = standard
  strain CYC = cyclophosphmide, ST = stool, CON = control. The comparison indicated
  is between treatment groups and the negative control group. No significant difference
  was observed between groups treated with L. a and CYC\n\nThe results of the proliferation
  assays are shown in Fig. 3. The data reflect the mean values of triplicates after
  stimulation with specific tumour antigen. Comparing the results of both groups,
  the data clearly demonstrated significant difference between the treatment groups
  and with the control.\n\nComparing the proliferation of splenocyts among treated
  and control group showed a significant increase in proliferation in L. acidophilus
  treated mice  and stool derived bacteria  as indicated with ). Positive control
  was treated with PHA and showed significant deference with other groups both controls
  and treatment groups. Error bars represent 2 SEM. SD = standard strain, CYC = cyclophosphmide,
  ST = stool, CON = control. C + represents the SI for cells treated with Phytohemagglutinin
  \ as positive control. The comparison indicated is between treatment groups and
  the negative control group \n\nThe cytokine pattern of splenocytes in tumour-bearing
  animals treated with L. acidophilus was evaluated and compared to control. Results
  showed a reduced production of IL-4 and increased production of IFN-. Increased
  production of IFN- in groups treated with L.a was statistically significant and
  additionally no difference was observed between treatment groups, stool  and cyclophosphamide
  \ respectively). Lower production of IL-4 in L.a treated groups however not statistically
  significant. Decrease in IL-4 production in mice treated with CYC was significant
  with a p-value of 0.008 and also had a significant difference with mice treated
  with L.a. Significant lower production of TGF- in probiotic treated groups was observed
  with no significant differences between groups of treatment.\n\nMice  were treated
  with L. acidophilus extracted from standard yogurt, neonatal stool  and cyclophosphamide
  \ for 15 days which after spleen cells were isolated and the levels of IFN-, IL-4
  and TGF- produced from splenocytes stimulated by tumour antigen extract was evaluated.
  Data represents mean  SEM. The comparison indicated is between treatment groups
  and the negative control group\n\nIn the gut lactobacilli and other probiotics are
  responsible for homeostasis of gut epithelium via various mechanisms one of which
  includes their anti-inflammatory actions which prevents excessive inflammatory damage
  to epithelial tissues. Cell wall components of lactobacilli and other probiotics,
  such as peptidoglycans and lipoteichoic acid, induce maturation and activation of
  DCs via toll-like receptor  2, as well as producing various proinflammatory cytokines
  and chemokines. Specific probiotic strains, in particular Lactobacillus strains,
  have been shown to interact with DCs and to induce strain-specific effects. Their
  beneficial health effects have been studied in various disease and natural response
  settings. For instance they are capable of inducing production of IFN- in vivo and
  in vitro models.\n\nProliferation of lymphocytes is the first indication of immune
  system activation by antigen. In this study we have shown that mice treated with
  L.a had a greater increase in splenocyte proliferation in response to tumour antigen.
  This increased proliferation has been reported previously.\n\nNatural killer cells
  are major source of IFN- which studies have shown that L.a is able to activate NK
  cells. They are also active participants in anti-tumour immunity. Therefore one
  possible mechanism by which L.a could have impacts on tumour growth control is by
  activating these innate anti-cancer cells. Takagi et al. have demonstrated that
  administration of Lactobacillus casei Shirota  in mice is able to delay the onset
  of carcinogen induced tumor and reduced tumor incidence. They showed that these
  effects were attributed to enhanced NK activity. Other studies have shown similar
  results by using heat killed strains. Yasdi et al. in similar experimental setting
  have shown that L.a is able to increase the levels of IL-12 in cultured splenocytes.
  Murosaki et al. have also shown the increase in IL-12 production via daily consumption
  of lactobacilli in tumour-bearing mice is required to exert an anti-tumour effect
  at the late stage of tumour development when the IL-12 production is considerably
  impaired. This cytokine is responsible for production of IFN- from stimulated T
  cells and enhancing the shift to a protective Th1 pattern which favours anti tumour
  immunity. The balance between Th1 and Th2 cytokine production can determine the
  direction and outcome of an immune response. As expected, this study showed that
  administration of lactobacilli was able to augment the production of IFN- from splenocyte.
  Increased production of IFN- in turn has other anti-cancer effects including anti-angiogenesis
  and increased NK activity. Thereby a continuous cascade of cytokine production and
  cellular activation, by definition, are responsible for L.a anti cancer mechanisms.
  These speculations surely are subject to further investigations. Our results showed
  that lactobacilli did not affect the production of IL-4 in treated tumour bearing
  animals. This finding is confirmed in a previous study by Gill et al. in which implied
  that regular ingestion of Lactobacillus strains is able to enhance the capacity
  of murine splenic leukocytes to produce IFN- following mitogenic stimulation, while
  IL-4 or IL-5 production is unaffected.\n\nTGF- is Th2 cytokine with an anti-inflammatory
  property which induces the production of IL-10 from tumour associated macrophages
  \ and aid the shift to Th2 pattern in tumour microenvironment. TGF- produced from
  tumour cells acts on the surrounding stromal cells, immune cells, endothelial cells
  and smooth muscle cells, causing immunosuppression and angiogenesis in the microenvironment.
  TGF is a key enforcer of immune tolerance, and tumors that produce high levels of
  this cytokine may be shielded from immune surveillance and is involved inhibition
  of proliferation of T cells. This study showed that L.a is able to decrease the
  production of TGF- from splenocytes in culture. Taken together, our findings suggest
  that probiotics La may play a role in attenuating tumour growth by altering the
  cytokine milieu and anti-tumoural cell activation during 4T1 cell carcinogenesis.
  It is possible to speculate that lactobacilli or other genera of probiotics could
  be used as an adjuvant treatment during anticancer chemotherapy.\n"
