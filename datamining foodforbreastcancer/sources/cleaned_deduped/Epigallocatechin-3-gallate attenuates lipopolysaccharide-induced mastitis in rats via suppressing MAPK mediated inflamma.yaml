text: '


  Green tea  is an extremely popular beverage worldwide. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate  is
  one of the major catechins isolated from green tea and contributes to its beneficial
  therapeutic functions including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer effects.
  However, the effect of EGCG on mastitis is not yet known. This study was to investigate
  the protective potential of EGCG against mastitis in rats. The rat mastitis model
  was induced by injecting lipopolysaccharide  into the duct of mammary gland. The
  mammary gland was collected after the experimental period. The levels of mammary
  oxidative stress and inflammatory responses were assessed by measuring the local
  activities of antioxidant enzymes and the levels of inflammatory cytokines. The
  mammary expressions of mitogen-activated protein kinases, nuclear factor B-p65  and
  hypoxia-inducible factor-1  were evaluated by western blot analysis. It was found
  that EGCG obviously normalized LPS-induced low activities of antioxidant enzymes
  as well as decreased the high levels of inflammatory cytokines. Additionally, EGCG
  inhibited the mammary over-expression of MAPKs, NFB-p65 and HIF-1. These results
  indicated that EGCG was able to attenuate LPS-induced mastitis in rats by suppressing
  MAPK related oxidative stress and inflammatory responses.'
