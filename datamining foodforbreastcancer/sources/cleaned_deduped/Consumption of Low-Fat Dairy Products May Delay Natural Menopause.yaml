  Later menopause is a risk factor for breast and endometrial cancer, yet few studies
  have investigated dietary predictors of this potentially modifiable event. In particular,
  dairy contains hormones and growth factors that could potentially impact menopausal
  timing. We therefore assessed the association between regular consumption of dairy
  foods and related nutrients and age at natural menopause. We conducted a prospective
  analysis with up to 20 y of follow-up in 46,059 participants in the Nurses Health
  Study who were premenopausal in 1980. We observed 30,816 events of natural menopause
  over 401,754 person-years. In the total population, the estimated mean age at natural
  menopause was 51.5 y for women who consumed no low-fat dairy and 51.5, 51.6, 51.7,
  and 51.8 y for women who consumed 0.11.0, 1.12.0, 2.13.0, and &gt;3 servings of
  low-fat dairy daily, respectively. Premenopausal women ;51 y of age consuming &gt;3
  servings of low-fat dairy per day were 14% less likely  to report natural menopause
  in the next month relative to those consuming 0.11 servings/d. Similar results were
  obtained for skim milk  but not for total high-fat dairy or whole milk. Dairy foods
  were not associated with age at menopause among women 51 y of age. These findings
  support the growing body of literature on the hormonally active nature of milk and
  dairy foods. '
