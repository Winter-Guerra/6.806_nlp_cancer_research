  cytotoxicity between tamoxifen and the plant toxin persin in human breast cancer
  cells is dependent on Bim e.md
text: '


  Phytochemicals have provided an abundant source of novel therapeutics for the treatment
  of human cancers. We have previously described a novel plant toxin, persin, derived
  from avocado leaves, which has unique in vivo actions in the mammary epithelium
  and Bim-dependent, cytotoxic effects in human breast cancer cells in vitro. Compounds
  structurally similar to persin, such as the polyunsaturated fatty acid, conjugated
  linoleic acid, can attenuate steroid hormone receptor signaling and modulate the
  response of breast cancer cells to antiestrogens. Here, we provide evidence that
  persin may have similar effects by showing its potent proapoptotic synergy with
  the antiestrogen 4-hydroxytamoxifen. However, although persin transcriptionally
  down-regulates estrogen receptor  expression, unlike conjugated linoleic acid, it
  also shows efficacy in ER-negative breast cancer cells, both alone and in combination
  with 4-hydroxytamoxifen, whereas normal breast epithelial cells are unaffected,
  suggesting it may act via a distinct, ER-independent mechanism. These proapoptotic
  synergistic interactions are associated with increased de novo ceramide synthesis
  and are dependent on expression of the proapoptotic protein Bim. These data show
  that persin should be further investigated as a potential novel cancer therapeutic
  agent because it significantly enhances the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to
  the cytotoxic effects of tamoxifen, regardless of their ER status, while displaying
  apparent specificity for the malignant phenotype.  '
