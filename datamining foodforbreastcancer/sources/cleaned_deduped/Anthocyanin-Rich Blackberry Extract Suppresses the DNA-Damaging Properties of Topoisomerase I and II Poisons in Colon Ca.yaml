  Blackberry Extract Suppresses the DNA-Damaging Properties of Topoisomerase I and
  II Poisons in Colon Ca.md
text: "\n\nIn the present study, we addressed the question whether cyanidin-3-glucoside
  \ or complex C3G-rich blackberry extracts affect human topoisomerases with special
  emphasis on the contribution of the potential degradation products phloroglucinol
  aldehyde  and protocatechuic acid. In HT29 colon carcinoma cells a C3G-rich blackberry
  extract suppressed camptothecin-  or doxorubicin-  induced stabilization of the
  covalent DNAtopoisomerase intermediate, thus antagonizing the effects of these classical
  topoisomerase poisons on DNA integrity. As a single compound, C3G  decreased the
  DNA-damaging effects of CPT as well, but did not significantly affect those induced
  by DOX. At the highest applied concentration, cyanidin protected DNA from CPT- and
  DOX-induced damage. Earlier reports on DNA-damaging properties of cyanidin were
  found to result most likely from the formation of hydrogen peroxide as an artifact
  in the cell culture medium when the incubation was performed in the absence of catalase.
  The suppression of hydrogen peroxide accumulation, achieved by the addition of catalase,
  demonstrated that cyanidin does not exhibit DNA-damaging properties in HT29 cells.
  The observed effects on topoisomerase interference and DNA protection against CPT
  or DOX were clearly limited to the parent compound and were not observed for the
  potential cyanidin degradation products PGA and PCA.\n\nEpidemiological studies
  emphasize that a diet rich in fruits and vegetables is associated with a lower incidence
  of cancer. Anthocyanins represent a class of colored plant constituents comprising
  a color spectrum from red to blue that occur in many fruits and vegetables of the
  daily diet. In the United States, the consumption of anthocyanins has been estimated
  to be higher than that of other flavonoids such as quercetin. In addition, based
  on their proposed health benefits, anthocyanins are widely consumed with functional
  foods and food supplements.\n\nBerry anthocyanins have been reported to exhibit
  anticancer properties in vivo. In vitro studies have demonstrated that several overlapping
  mechanisms of action might contribute to their biological effects, including the
  inhibition of receptor tyrosine kinases, the induction of apoptosis, and the interference
  with human topoisomerases. We previously reported that the free aglycone delphinidin,
  a so-called anthocyanidin, acts as a catalytic topoisomerase inhibitor in human
  colon carcinoma cells and diminishes the DNA-damaging properties of classical topoisomerase
  poisons.\n\nThe bioavailability of anthocyanins is reported to be quite limited
  depending on the structure of the aglycone and the sugar moieties. Under in vitro
  conditions, limited chemical stability of the nonglycosylated anthocyanidins has
  been repeatedly reported. Several authors have confirmed that protocatechuic acid
  \ is the dominant degradation product of cyanidin in cell culture. In addition,
  anthocyanins as well as their respective aglycones, have been discussed to represent
  substrates for microbial degradation by human intestinal bacteria, also resulting
  in the formation of the respective benzoic acids and phloroglucinol aldehyde ).\n\nSo
  far, the cellular effects of the free aglycons, the anthocyanidins, have been part
  of numerous studies, whereas knowledge on the biological relevance of the glycosylated
  anthocyanins, as well as the formed degradation products, which have a higher chemical
  and microbial stabilities, is quite limited. Furthermore, several reports have discussed
  the question of whether the formation of hydrogen peroxide under cell culture conditions,
  resulting from the reaction of polyphenols with yet-unknown culture medium constituents,
  leads to in vitro artifacts, thereby interfering with the cellular effectiveness
  of the respective polyphenols.\n\nIn the present study, we addressed the question
  whether interference with topoisomerases is limited to the free anthocyanidins or
  whether the respective glycosides, exemplified for cyanidin-3-glucoside, or even
  complex C3G-rich blackberry extracts also affect human topoisomerases. The aim of
  the study was to elucidate whether C3G-rich blackberry extracts, already available
  as food supplements, are likely to suppress the DNA-damaging properties of topoisomerase
  poisons used clinically for cancer treatment with special emphasis on the potential
  contribution of C3G and its corresponding degradation products. For comparison,
  the aglycone cyanidin, which is not present in native blackberry extracts but might
  be liberated after bacterial deglycosylation, was included in the testing.\n\nCyanidin
  was purchased from Extrasynthse, whereas camptothecin, doxorubicine, protocatechuic
  acid, phloroglucinol aldehyde, and catalase were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Gmbh.
  Cyanidin-3-glucoside  was obtained from Carl Roth GmbH. For all assays, the compound
  solutions were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide  before the beginning of the experiment,
  without use of stored stock solutions.\n\nThe blackberry extract was an XAD-7-purified
  extract and was obtained from Prof. P. Winterhalter, University of Braunschweig.
  Anthocyanin measurements were carried out by high-performance liquid chromatography
  /diode array detector /tandem mass spectrometry. Analysis was performed on an HP
  1200 series instrument  equipped with a degaser, a binary HPLC pump, a DAD, an autoinjector,
  and a column oven. For HPLC conditions, please see ref 31. The eluent was recorded
  with diode array detection at 520 nm for quantification of the anthocyanins. For
  identification, the HPLC system was directly coupled to a hybrid triple-quadrupole
  linear ion-trap mass spectrometer, equipped with a TurboIonSpray source. The analytes
  were detected in positive-ion mode at a vaporizer temperature of 650 C and an ion-spray
  voltage of 5.5 kV. Nitrogen was used for both curtain gas and collision gas, at
  10 psi and medium, respectively. The collision energy and declustering potential
  were set to 10 V. Data acquisition was performed in full scan mode. Identification
  and quantification of further polyphenols  was performed as described previously.
  Quantification of all compounds  was performed by external calibration using commercially
  available reference compounds. Calibration curves for the different polyphenols
  were constructed in the range of 0.05100 M in which the response was linear. The
  quantification of those polyphenols that are not commercial available was based
  on a representative standard of the same polyphenol class. The limits of detection
  ranged between 200 fmol and 6 pmol.\n\nThe anthocyanin content in the blackberry
  extract was 100 mg/. C3G, cyanidin-3-dioxalyl glucoside, cyanidin-3-rutinoside,
  cyanidin pentoside, and two further cyanidin derivatives were identified, with C3G
  \ as the major compound.\n\nThe human colon carcinoma cell line HT29 was cultivated
  in Dulbeccos modified Eagles medium. Cell culture medium was supplemented with 10%
  fetal calf serum  and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. DMEM and the supplements were
  obtained from Invitrogen Life Technologies.\n\nBriefly, 5000 HT29 cells were seeded
  per well into 24-well plates and allowed to grow for 48 h before treatment. Thereafter,
  cells were incubated with the respective drug in the absence or presence of catalase
  \ for 72 h in serum-containing medium. Effects on cell growth were determined according
  to the method of Skehan et al. previously described by Kern et al.\n\nBriefly, 40000
  HT29 cells were seeded per well into 24-well plates and allowed to grow for 48 h
  before treatment. The incubation conditions were adjusted according to the SRB assay,
  with incubation in the presence of catalase  in serum-containing medium. The formation
  of hydrogen peroxide was measured after several time points  using the Amplex Red
  hydrogen peroxide assay kit from Sigma  following the manufacturers protocol.\n\nHT29
  cells  were spread into Petri dishes  and allowed to grow for 48 h prior to treatment
  with drugs. In the experiments with single compounds, HT29 cells were treated for
  1 h with the solvent control  or the test compounds in serum-free medium in the
  presence of catalase. For the coincubation experiments, HT29 cells were preincubated
  for 30 min with the solvent control  or the respective test compound and were then
  coincubated for 1 h with 100 M CPT or 10 M doxorubicin. The comet assay was performed
  according to the method of Gedik et al. previously reported by Esselen et al.\n\nThe
  ICE bioassay was performed with slight modifications as described previously by
  Esselen et al. According to this method, 1.2  106 HT29 cells were spread into Petri
  dishes  and allowed to grow for 48 h. Thereafter, the cells were incubated with
  the solvent control, CPT, DOX, or blackberry extract under serum-free conditions.
  For the coincubation experiments, HT29 cells were treated for 30 min with the solvent
  control  or blackberry extract and then coincubated for 1 h with 10 M CPT or 10
  M DOX. The medium was removed, and the cells were abraded at room temperature in
  3 mL of TE buffer. Cell lysates were layered onto a cesium chloride gradient in
  polyallomer tubes. One gradient consisted of four layers  of cesium chloride with
  a decreasing density from the bottom to the top. The tubes were centrifuged at 100,000g
  for 24 h at 20 C. The gradients were fractionated  from the bottom of the tubes.
  The DNA content in the single fractions was determined by measuring the absorbency
  at 260 nm using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer, and all fractions were blotted onto
  a nitrocellulose membrane using a slot blot apparatus. Topoisomerase was detected
  using a rabbit polyclonal antibody against topoisomerase I, topoisomerase II, or
  topoisomerase II. An antimouse IgG peroxidase conjugate  or an antirabbit IgG peroxidase
  conjugate  was used as secondary antibodies. All antibodies were purchased from
  Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The respective chemoluminescent signals  were analyzed
  using the LAS 3000 with the AIDA Image Analyzer 3.52 software for quantification.
  Arbitrary light units were plotted as the ratio of test to control.\n\nThe effects
  of blackberry extract, the major anthocyanin C3G, and the potential degradation
  products PCA and PGA on the growth of HT29 cells were determined using the SRB assay.
  The blackberry extract potently inhibited the growth of HT29 cells with a half-maximal
  inhibitory concentration  of 120  30 g/mL. The presence of catalase significantly
  diminished its growth inhibitory properties. In the absence of catalase, C3G exhibited
  marginal growth inhibitory properties without reaching an IC50 value of up to 300
  M in the cell culture medium. In the presence of catalase, no effect on tumor cell
  growth was observed. We reported previously that the aglycone cyanidin suppresses
  the growth of HT29 cells in micromolar concentrations, yet the present study revealed
  that the addition of catalase to the cell culture medium is associated with a complete
  loss of growth inhibitory properties in concentrations up to 300 M. Among the degradation
  products, PGA potently diminished the growth of HT29 cells. Of note, the presence
  of catalase did not affect its growth inhibitory properties. In contrast, growth
  inhibition mediated by PCA as previously described in ref 20 was slightly diminished
  in the presence of catalase.\n\nTable 2. Effects of the Test Compounds on the Growth
  of Human Colon Carcinoma Cells Using the Sulforhodamine B Assaya)  \n\nTo assess
  whether cyanidin leads to increased extracellular hydrogen peroxide formation in
  DMEM media, HT29 cells were incubated with cyanidin for 72 h. The hydrogen peroxide
  concentration in the cell culture medium was measured after 15 min, 45 min, 24 h,
  and 72 h. The short-time incubation of cyanidin  determined the concentration-dependent
  formation of hydrogen peroxide in the micromolar range, which was slightly enhanced
  after 45 min. Coincubation with catalase reduced the hydrogen peroxide concentration
  in the cell culture medium to the level of the solvent control. After both 24 and
  72 h, no hydrogen peroxide accumulation in the medium of HT29 cells was detected.\n\nFigure

  45 min. The data presented are the means  standard deviations of at least two independent
  experiments, each performed in duplicate.  Single-cell gel electrophoresis  with
  HT29 cells. Cells were treated under serum-free conditions with cyanidin in the
  presence or absence of catalase. The data presented are the means  standard deviations
  of at least three independent experiments, each performed in duplicate. Significances
  indicated refer to the significance level as compared to the respective control.\n\nThe
  impact of hydrogen peroxide formation on the DNA-damaging properties of cyanidin
  was investigated in the comet assay. To determine a possible contribution of hydrogen
  peroxide to the DNA-damaging properties of cyanidin, HT29 cells were incubated with
  cyanidin in either the absence or the presence of catalase. In line with earlier
  results, in the absence of catalase, cyanidin increased the amount of DNA strand
  breaks in HT29 cells in a concentration-dependent fashion. At concentrations of
  50 M cyanidin, a significant increase of DNA strand breakage was observed. In contrast,
  in the presence of catalase, cyanidin did not induce DNA damage in HT29 cells up
  to 100 M.\n\nFurthermore, the DNA-strand-breaking properties of the anthocyanin
  C3G  and the degradation products PGA and PCA  were investigated in the comet assay.
  In the presence of catalase, none of the test compounds induced DNA strand breakage
  in HT29 cells after 1 h of incubation.\n\nWe reported previously that hydroxylated
  anthocyanidins such as delphinidin act as a catalytic topoisomerase inhibitor, suppressing
  the stabilizing effect of the topoisomerase poisons CPT, etoposide, and DOX on the
  covalent topoisomeraseDNA intermediate, thus decreasing the DNA-damaging potential
  of these antineoplastic agents in human colon carcinoma cells. In the present study,
  we addressed the question whether these effects are limited to the free aglycon
  \ or whether a respective glycoside  or even a C3G-rich complex extract  affects
  the rate of topoisomerase poison-induced DNA strand breaks as well. Furthermore,
  we also addressed the question whether putative anthocyanin degradation products
  \ contribute to the potential DNA-protective effect of the extract.\n\nHT29 cells
  were pretreated for 30 min with the respective test compound and then coincubated
  with CPT  or DOX  for 1 h. As expected, treatment of HT29 cells with CPT or DOX
  as single compounds resulted in a significant increase of DNA strand breaks.\n\nFigure

  \ its aglycone cyanidin on the DNA-strand-breaking properties of camptothecin  or
  doxorubicin  in HT29 cells in the presence of catalase  tested in the comet assay.
  For the coincubation experiments, HT29 cells were preincubated for 30 min with the
  solvent control  or the respective test compound and then coincubated for 1 h with
  100 M CPT or 10 M DOX. DMSO  was included in the testing as the solvent control.
  All incubations were performed in the presence of catalase. The data presented are
  the means  standard deviations of at least three independent experiments, each performed
  in duplicate. Significances indicated refer the significance level compared to the
  respective control  or to the respective topoisomerase poison.\n\nIn the presence
  of blackberry extract, the DNA-damaging effects of CPT and DOX were diminished to
  a significant extent and in a concentration-dependent fashion. The major anthocyanin
  of the blackberry extract, C3G, significantly reduced the rate of DNA strand breaks
  induced by CPT at a concentration of 100 M. In the case of DOX, a slight but not
  significant decrease of DNA damage was observed. The treatment with the aglycone
  cyanidin resulted in a concentration-dependent decrease of the amount of CPT- and
  DOX-induced DNA strand breaks, with a significant effectiveness at 100 M cyanidin.
  In contrast, the potential degradation products PCA and PGA did not affect the DNA-strand-breaking
  properties of the topoisomerase poisons CPT and DOX.\n\nBlackberry Extract Diminishes
  Cleavable Complex Stabilization by Topoisomerase Poisons\n\nDelphinidin was characterized
  as a pure catalytic topoisomerase inhibitor within intact human colon carcinoma
  cells. However, so far, little is known about the impact of glycosylated anthocyanins
  and their degradation products on topoisomerase inhibition within intact tumor cells.
  In this study, we used the ICE bioassay to directly determine the amount of topoisomerase
  covalently linked to the DNA. After 1 h of incubation, CPT  potently enhanced the
  amount of topoisomerase I in the DNA-containing fractions, indicative of a cleavable
  complex  stabilization. The topoisomerase II poison DOX  highly elevated the level
  of topoisomerase II  and II  bound to DNA. In contrast, treatment of HT29 cells
  with the anthocyanin-rich blackberry extract  did not result in a stabilization
  of the topoisomerase/DNA intermediate, presented for topoisomerase I and II as examples
  in Figure 3A.\n\nFigure 3.  Detection of the covalent topoisomerase I and topoisomerase
  II/DNA intermediate in HT29 cells in the ICE assay. Cells were treated with the
  respective test compound for 1 h in the presence of catalase. A representative immunoblot
  of three independent experiments is shown. Impacts of  blackberry extract and  C3G
  and protocatechuic acid on the camptothecin- or doxorubicin-stabilized enzyme/DNA
  complexes in the ICE assay. HT29 cells were pretreated with blackberry extract,
  C3G, or protocatechuic acid for 30 min and then coincubated with blackberry extract,
  C3G, or protocatechuic acid and CPT  or DOX  for 1 h. The treatment was performed
  in the presence of catalase. A representative immunoblot is shown. The level of
  topoisomerase/DNA intermediate was calculated as the ratio of coincubated cells
  to control cells  with respect to DNA content  100%. The data presented are the
  means  standard deviations of three independent experiments. Significances indicated
  refer the significance level compared to the respective topoisomerase poison CPT
  or DOX.\n\nThe above-mentioned results indicate that blackberry anthocyanins target
  topoisomerases prior to their binding to the DNA. To extend this hypothesis, the
  ICE assay was used for competition studies in cultured HT29 cells. HT29 cells were
  pretreated with the blackberry extract, C3G, or the degradation product PCA for
  30 min and then coincubated with the extract, C3G or PCA, and CPT or DOX in combination
  for 1 h. Blackberry extract at a concentration of 10 g/mL significantly reduced
  the amount of topoisomerase I covalently bound to DNA stabilized by 10 M CPT. At
  a concentration of 50 g/mL blackberry extract, the DNAtopoisomerase I binding was
  diminished by up to 20% in comparison to the respective CPT-treated control cells.
  The levels of topoisomerase II and II in the DNA peak fractions stabilized by DOX
  \ were significantly decreased after pre- and coincubation with 50 g/mL blackberry
  extract, with a slightly more pronounced effect on the topoisomerase II isoform.
  In contrast, C3G in concentrations up to 250 M and the tested degradation product
  PCA at a concentration of 250 M did not modulate the amount of topoisomerase I/II
  covalently bound to DNA.\n\nWe reported previously that the anthocyanidin delphinidin
  acts as a catalytic topoisomerase inhibitor in human colon carcinoma cells and diminishes
  the DNA-damaging properties of classical topoisomerase poisons, indicating an additional
  molecular mechanism to be considered in the spectrum of bioactive features of this
  food constituent. These results raised the question whether high consumption of
  anthocyanidins in humans might compromise the outcome of respective cancer therapy.
  However, with respect to the potential relevance of these findings, it has to be
  taken into account that free anthocyanidins are rare in natural food items and rather
  are consumed predominantly in their glycosylated form within complex polyphenol
  mixtures. Further, it must be taken into account that intensive degradation might
  occur within the gastrointestinal tract, probably contributing to the bioactivity
  of these products. Thus, in the present study, we compared the effects of the free
  aglycon  with those of a respective glycoside, a complex blackberry extract containing
  C3G as the major anthocyanidin, and the potential cyanidin degradation products
  PCA and PGA.\n\nThe effects on tumor cell growth were determined. The blackberry
  extract was found to diminish cell growth of HT29 cells, although the presence of
  catalase significantly attenuated this effect. In accordance with earlier reports,
  the free aglycone cyanidin was found to exhibit potent growth inhibitory properties.
  The addition of catalase resulted in a loss of any growth inhibitory properties
  of cyanidin as well as the respective glycoside, suggesting that the formation of
  hydrogen peroxide acts as a major contributor to the observed growth inhibitory
  effects, thus generating experimental artifacts that are presumably limited to the
  conditions of the cell culture medium. Different authors have reported substantial
  hydrogen peroxide formation under cell culture conditions. Short-time incubation
  of HT29 cells with cyanidin  indeed demonstrated the concentration-dependent formation
  of hydrogen peroxide in the cell culture medium in the micromolar range, even being
  slightly enhanced after 45 min. Addition of catalase effectively diminished the
  hydrogen peroxide concentration in the cell culture medium down to the level of
  the solvent control. Yet, after long-time incubation, no enhanced hydrogen peroxide
  level was detected. The observation that hydrogen peroxide accumulation seems to
  be an early event, yet changing cell signaling constantly, is in line with earlier
  findings. Furthermore, the contribution of hydrogen peroxide to the detected growth
  inhibition of the test compounds in the absence of catalase can be assumed. Taken
  together, the data enforce the necessity of adding a H2O2-scavenging system to in
  vitro cell culture assays when effects of polyphenol structures are applied for
  testing.\n\nSeveral publications have discussed the possibility that biological
  effects might be mediated not by anthocyanins themselves but rather by the released
  aglycons or even respective degradation products such as PGA and PCA. Of note, only
  PGA displayed growth inhibition properties. In 2009, Woodward et al. investigated
  the degradation of C3G to PGA and PCA. In accordance with our results, concentrations
  where growth inhibitory effects of PGA were achieved were nearly 100-fold higher
  than the maximum concentrations that might arise from the degradation of C3G in
  the blackberry extract concentrations applied in the present study. Thus, the detected
  effects of PGA on cell growth appear not to be of relevance for the influence of
  the overall extract.\n\nTo investigate whether generated hydrogen peroxide might
  also contribute to the DNA-damaging properties of cyanidin, a comet assay was performed
  in both the presence and the absence of catalase. In line with earlier results,
  in the absence of catalase, cyanidin did increase the amount of DNA strand breaks
  in HT29 in a concentration-dependent fashion. Yet, the addition of catalase reduced
  this effect to the level of the solvent control. Furthermore, neither the blackberry
  extract nor the isolated constituent C3G nor the degradation products PGA and PCA
  induced DNA strand breaks in HT29 cells in the presence of catalase. In contrast,
  the blackberry extract, C3G, and cyanidin  were identified as protectors against
  DNA-damaging topoisomerase poisons. Because 76% of the blackberry anthocyanins within
  the tested extract represents C3G, the contribution of C3G to the detected DNA-protective
  properties of the blackberry extract from topoisomerase I poisons  can be assumed.
  Hence, the more potent protection from topoisomerase I poison-caused damage by C3G
  might also explain the stronger protective effects of the C3G-rich extract from
  DNA damage caused by CPT.\n\nThe high DNA-protective properties of cyanidin are
  in line with previously reported data, where we demonstrated that the anthocyanidin
  delphinidin acts as a catalytic topoisomerase inhibitor suppressing the DNA-strand-breaking
  effects of different topoisomerase poisons  etoposide, and DOX). Of note, the cyanidin
  degradation products PCA and PGA did not protect HT29 cells from the DNA-strand-breaking
  properties of the two topoisomerase poisons. Therefore, the potent DNA-protecting
  properties can be attributed to the parent compound, implying that degradation is
  expected to result in a loss of DNA-protective properties.\n\nInterestingly, the
  complex blackberry extract turned out to be more potent than expected based on the
  anthocyanin content, indicating the presence of further constituents with DNA-protective
  qualities.\n\nTo gain further information on the mode of action, the amount of topoisomerase
  covalently linked to the DNA in HT29 cells was determined by the use of the ICE
  bioassay. Different authors have reported that flavonoids suppress the activity
  of human topoisomerases and thereby alter DNA integrity. Anthocyanidins bearing
  vicinal hydroxyl groups at the B-ring, such as cyanidin or delphinidin, could be
  identified as pure catalytic topoisomerase inhibitors, lacking stabilizing effects
  on the covalent enzyme/DNA intermediate, whereas polyphenols such as genistein or
  -epigallocatechin-3-gallate seem to act as topoisomerase poisons thereby forming
  a covalent complex with the DNAtopoisomerase intermediate. In a recent study berry
  extracts, rich in glycosylated anthocyanins, potently diminish topoisomerase I and
  topoisomerase II activity with a preference to topoisomerase II.\n\nIn contrast
  to CPT, which induced cleavable complex stabilization of topoisomerase I, or DOX,
  which strongly elevated the levels of topoisomerase II  and II bound to DNA, the
  anthocyanin-rich blackberry extract  did not result in a stabilization of the topoisomeraseDNA
  intermediate  and thus appears not to act as a topoisomerase poison.\n\nTo evaluate
  whether the blackberry anthocyanins, C3G, or the cyanidin degradation product PCA
  might target topoisomerases prior to their binding to DNA, as reported previously
  for the free aglycone delphinidin, the ICE assay was used for competition studies.
  Pretreatment of HT29 cells with the blackberry extract  for 30 min before coincubation
  with CPT resulted in a significantly reduced amount of topoisomerase I covalently
  bound to DNA, already at low extract concentrations. Furthermore, the level of DOX-
  \ stabilized topoisomerase II and II in the DNA peak fractions was significantly
  decreased by coincubation with blackberry extract, with a slightly more pronounced
  effect on the topoisomerase II isoform. Thus, the blackberry extract again exhibited
  a slightly more potent capacity to prevent from topoisomerase I poison-  induced
  DNA damage, supporting the results detected in the comet assay. In contrast to the
  blackberry extract, C3G  and the degradation product PCA  did not modulate the stability
  of the DNA/topoisomerase complex I and II. Thus, a contribution of C3G or its degradation
  product PCA to the effects of the blackberry extract seems to be unlikely.\n\nTaken
  together, our data show that pretreatment of cells with blackberry extract diminishes
  the cleavable complex stabilizing effect of topoisomerase I and II poisons. In cell-free
  test systems, cyanidin was already identified as a potent inhibitor of topoisomerase
  activity. Taking into account the DNA-protective effects of C3G seen in the comet
  assay, a contribution of C3G to the DNA-protective properties of the blackberry
  extract seems to be conceivable, also presumably not mediated by decreasing the
  levels of covalent DNAtopoisomerase intermediates. Yet, earlier studies also identified
  complex polyphenolic extracts as even more potent modulators of topoisomerase activity
  than isolated constituents. Hence, synergistic effects and/or a contribution of
  yet-unknown constituents might have to be considered. Oligomeric and polymeric procyanidins,
  also present in berries and grapes, have already been identified as topoisomerase
  inhibitors; thus, a contribution of such structures to the effects seen here might
  also be of relevance.\n\nIn summary, our data identified a C3G-rich blackberry extract
  as a potent suppressor of topoisomerase activity in vitro, interfering with classical
  topoisomerase poisons thus leading to the protection of DNA. Furthermore, the blackberry
  extract suppresses DNA complex formation by topoisomerase poisons in HT29 cells.
  To estimate a possible relevance of the detected DNA-protecting properties of the
  C3G-rich blackberry under in vivo conditions, their bioavailability must be taken
  into account. Studies in 2006 by Kahle et al. on the bioavailability of a blueberry
  extract for ileostomy patients indicated that, depending on the sugar moiety of
  the anthocyanins, up to 85% could be determined in the ileostomy bags and, therefore,
  could reach the colon. Assuming a consumption of 200 g of blackberries with an anthocyanin
  content of 50 mg of total anthocyanins in 100 g, a local concentration in the gastrointestinal
  tract comparable to the bioactive concentrations applied here is achievable. Thus,
  a relevance of the biological activity of the blackberry extract detected here under
  in vivo conditions seems to be reasonable. In the case of coapplication with therapeutically
  applied topoisomerase poisons, as prescribed in several chemotherapeutic schemes,
  this could lead to a reduced effectiveness of the chemotherapeutics, at least locally
  in the gastrointestinal tract.  \n\n"
