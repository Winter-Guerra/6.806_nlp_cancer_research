  Effect of Quercetin On Doxorubicin Cytotoxicity in Human Breast Cancer Cells.md
text: '


  Multidrug resistance has became the major obstacle to cancer chemotherapy. Recent
  studies suggest that quercetin could enhance the response of tumors to chemotherapy
  although the mechanism by which quercetin enhances the sensitivity of tumor cells
  to chemical drugs remains elusive. Therefore, in this study, we examined the effects
  of quercetin on doxorubicin cytotoxicity in human breast cancer cells and investigated
  the underlying mechanisms. MCF-7 and MCF-7/ dox cells were exposed to doxorubicin,
  quercetin, or combination of both agents for 36 hours. Cell proliferation, cell
  invasion, intracellular doxorubicin concentration and expression of hypoxia-inducible
  factor-1 alpha  and P-glycoprotein  were then assessed. Quercetin had little effect
  on cell proliferation at concentrations less than 0.7 M. Compared to treatment with
  doxorubicin alone, combined treatment with doxorubicin and quercetin  significantly
  inhibited cell proliferation and invasion and suppressed the expression of HIF-1
  and P-gp. Quercetin  increased the intracellular doxorubicin concentration and enhanced
  doxorubicin cytotoxicity as 1.49-fold in MCF-7 cells and 1.98-fold in MCF-7/dox
  cells. These data suggest that quercetin can increase the chemosensitivity of breast
  cancer cells to doxorubicin.'
