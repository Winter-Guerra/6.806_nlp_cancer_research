  Alcohol intake has been associated to breast cancer in pre and postmenopausal women;
  however results are inconclusive regarding tumor hormonal receptor status, and potential
  modifying factors like age at start drinking. Therefore, we investigated the relation
  between alcohol intake and the risk of breast cancer using prospective observational
  data from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition. Up to
  334,850 women, aged 35-70 years at baseline, were recruited in ten European countries
  and followed up an average of 11 years. Alcohol intake at baseline and average lifetime
  alcohol intake were calculated from country-specific dietary and lifestyle questionnaires.
  The study outcomes were the Hazard ratios  of developing breast cancer according
  to hormonal receptor status. During 3,670,439 person-years, 11,576 incident breast
  cancer cases were diagnosed. Alcohol intake was significantly related to breast
  cancer risk, for each 10g/day increase in alcohol intake the HR increased by 4.2%.
  Taking 0 to 5g/day as reference, alcohol intake of &gt;5 to 15g/day was related
  to a 5.9% increase in breast cancer risk. Significant increasing trends were observed
  between alcohol intake and ER+/PR+, ER-/PR-, HER2- and ER-/PR-/HER2- tumors. Breast
  cancer risk was stronger among women who started drinking prior to first full-time
  pregnancy. Overall, our results confirm the association between alcohol intake and
  both hormone receptor positive and hormone receptor negative breast tumors, suggesting
  that timing of exposure to alcohol drinking may affect the risk. Therefore, women
  should be advised to control their alcohol consumption. This article is protected
