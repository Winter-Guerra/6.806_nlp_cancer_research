text: "\n\nOverexpressed Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2  drives the biology
  of 20% breast cancer and is a prediction of a poor prognosis for patients. HER2-targeted
  therapies significantly improve outcomes for HER2-positive patients. Traditional
  Chinese herbs/medicines have been used to treat breast cancer patients including
  HER2-positive patients in Asia for decades. Although the traditional medicines demonstrate
  efficacy in clinics for HER2-positive patients, the mechanism is largely unknown.
  In this article, we screened a 10,000 natural product library in 6 different cell
  lines representing breast cancer, and assessed the ability of each drug to cause
  cytotoxicity through a high-throughput screening approach. We have identified eight
  natural compounds that selectively inhibit the proliferation of HER2-positive cells.
  Two of the hit compounds, peonidin-3-glucoside and cyaniding-3-glucoside, are both
  extracts from black rice. They inhibit the phospho-HER2 and phospho-AKT and were
  confirmed to induce HER2-psotive breast cancer cells apoptosis both in vitro and
  in vivo. Peonidin-3-glucoside and cyaniding-3-glucoside treatments significantly
  reduced the tumor size and volume in vivo compared to the control group. There is
  no significant difference of antitumorgenic effects between peonidin-3-glucoside
  and cyaniding-3-glucoside treatments.\n\nCitation: Liu W, Xu J, Wu S, Liu Y, Yu

  cancer is a serious and sometimes life-threatening disease. An estimated 232,340
  new cases of invasive breast cancer are expected to be diagnosed among women in
  the US during 2013 according to American Cancer Society. Breast cancer has also
  become common to Chinese women in recent years possibly due to the change of environments,
  growth patterns, diet and aging. Based on the model generated by Linos et al., in
  2021, the estimated breast cancer incidence rate would be 85.3 to 87.8 per 100,000
  woman in China. Evidently, there is a clear need for the development of new therapeutic
  agents.\n\nHER2 overexpression occurs in ~20% of patients with breast cancer and
  is associated with aggressive disease and decreased survival. A number of therapeutic
  approaches have been developed against HER2 worldwide including tyrosine kinase
  inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies such as Trastuzumab. The mechanism has been largely
  studied and since then, the disease-free survival and overall survival of patients
  have all been improved significantly . In China, there are reports of successful
  novel therapeutic approaches using traditional medicine for breast cancer patients,
  7. Traditional Chinese Herbs/Medicines have developed into a mature system for more
  than three thousand years. Although thousands of Traditional Chinese Medicines have
  been proved to be effective clinically, the mechanisms of the drug actions are largely
  unclear. With the modern technology, researchers successfully purified and identified
  numerous extracts that have not been well defined before. With the rich prior human
  experiences, we proposed to screen a natural product library which contains 10,000
  extracts against representative breast cancer cells and tried to identify compounds
  that selectively inhibit HER2-positive breast cancer cells.\n\nThe natural product
  library contains 10,000 natural products with a minimum of 98% purity confirmed
  by NMR and HPLC. Briefly, compounds were extracted by supercritical CO2 extraction
  \ and the residues after SFE-CO2 extraction were then refluxed with 80% ethanol
  and the ethanol extracts were spray-dried to obtain the extracts. Then the extracts
  samples were compared to the reference chemical standards purchased from the National
  Institute for the Control of Pharmaceutical and Biological Products  by Pharmanic.
  The conditions of the solvent gradient elution were 8-20%  in 020 min, 2040%  in
  2530 min, 4070%  in 3045 min, 7090%  in 5560 min at a flow-rate of 1.0 ml/min. Detection
  was conducted with different wavelengths of 230, 240, 270, 262, and 420 nm with
  the reference wavelength of 550 nm at room temperature. Compounds were present at
  10 mmol/L in DMSO. Afatinib  was gifted from the Pharmacology department of Chengdu
  Medical College with a &gt;98% purity.\n\nAll cell lines were obtained from the
  American Type Culture Collection  except SUM190. SUM190 cells were gifted from Chengdu
  Medical College bio-core facility. MCF-7, MDA-MB-453 and MDA-MB-231 cells were maintained
  in DMEM supplemented with 2 mmol/L L-glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.
  BT474 cells were maintained in DMEM: Hams F12 medium  supplemented with 2 mmol/L
  L-glutamine, 5 g/ml insulin, 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.
  HCC1569 cells were maintained in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
  serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. All cells were maintained in a 5% CO2 atmosphere
  at 37C.\n\nTable 1.  Breast cancer cell lines used in HTS and their molecular classifications,.\n\nTo
  identify compounds that might have inhibitory effect on breast cancer cell proliferation,
  we used a high-throughput drug screen experimental approach to assess the activity
  of 10,000 natural compounds. Prior to the screen, the cell viability assay was miniaturized
  to a 96-well, low-volume, black, flat-bottom polystyrene microplates  format to
  accelerate assay throughput. Cells were grown to 80% confluence, harvested and aliquoted
  into 96-well plates at concentrations of 1,000 cells per well in a total volume
  of 90 L/well. The outer wells were inoculated with medium to minimize evaporation
  from the sample wells. Cells were allowed to attach overnight and 10 l culture medium
  that containing either vehicle or drug at a 100 mol/L concentration were added to
  give a final concentration of 10 mol/L. Cell proliferation was evaluated using 20
  L Alamar-Blue reagent per well according to manufacturers instructions after 72-h
  incubation. The plates were then incubated at 37C for an additional 4 h and the
  fluorescent signal was measured. Fluorescence was measured with an excitation at
  530 nm and emission at 590 nm on ZS-2 plate reader. After background subtraction,
  cell viability values were normalized to vehicle controls and expressed as percentage
  of the mean of the relative vehicle controls. Compounds which showed a percentage
  of inhibition against cell proliferation more than 50% are defined as hit compounds
  for each cell line. Vehicle only wells served as intra-plate controls on each plate
  were uniformly distributed throughout the screen. Background plates containing vehicle
  only served as inter-plate controls were inserted throughout the screen. The controls
  were used to calculate the background levels/noises of the assay and to evaluate
  assay response as well as performance. Performance of the assay was assessed using
  Z factors.\n\nCells were grown to 80% confluence, harvested and aliquoted into 96
  well plates at concentrations of 1,000 cells per well in a total volume of 90 L/well.
  Hit compounds or vehicle  were then loaded to each well to give a final doses range
  from 50 mol/L to 0.03 mol/L  in 100 L total volume. Cells were cultured for 72 hours
  at 37C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Aliquots of 20 L Alamar-Blue reagent were added directly
  to each well, the plates were incubated at 37C for 3 h and the fluorescent signal
  was measured with an excitation at 530 nm and emission at 590 nm on ZS-2 plate reader.
  Data were normalized as percentage inhibition relative to vehicle control. IC50
  values were estimated using a four parameter logistic curve model by SigmaPlot 12.0.\n\nCells
  were grown to 7080% confluence, harvested and aliquoted into 100 mm dishes. Media
  was removed and replaced by media supplied with different doses of compounds the
  next day. Dished were incubated for an additional 6 h. Cells were washed with PBS
  and cell lysates were prepared by scraping cells into RIPA buffer with protease
  inhibitor and phosphatase inhibitor. The homogenates were centrifuged. The supernatants
  were transferred to fresh tubes and protein concentrations were determined using
  the Bio-Rad protein assay  per manufacturers instructions. Equal amounts of total
  protein  were subjected to electrophoresis  and transferred to PVDF membranes. Membranes
  were blocked in TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20  and 5% nonfat milk or 5% BSA for
  1 hour at room temperature. Primary antibodies were diluted per manufacturers instructions
  and incubated in TBST/5% nonfat milk or TBST/5% BSA for 2 h at room temperature
  or overnight at 4C. Secondary antibodies were diluted  and incubated with PVDF membranes
  for 1 h at room temperature. Proteins were detected by ECL plus western blotting
  detection system. The following antibodies were used: anti-phospho-HER2, anti-HER2,
  anti-phospho-AKT, anti-AKT, anti-phospho-p42/44MAPK, anti-p42/44MAPK, and anti--actin
  antibodies.\n\nCells were treated with hit compounds for 48 h at 37C, pooled and
  washed with PBS for three times, and re-suspended in binding buffer. Cells were
  then stained with annexin-V-FITC antibody supplied by the Chengdu Medical College
  Flow-cytometry core facility. Propidium iodide   was added immediately prior to
  analysis. Bivariant analysis of FITC fluorescence and PI fluorescence gave different
  cell populations, where FITC  and PI  were designated as viable cells, FITC  and
  PI  as apoptotic cells, and FITC  and PI  as late apoptotic or necrotic cells.\n\nCells
  were grown to 7080% confluence, harvested and aliquoted into 96-well plates. Different
  doses of compounds were added to the plates the next day. Plates were incubated
  for an additional 48 h at 37C. Aliquots of Alamar-Blue reagent were added directly
  to each well, the plates were incubated at 37C for 3 h and the fluorescent signal
  was measured with an excitation at 530 nm and emission at 590 nm on ZS-2 plate reader.
  Then equal volume of caspase 3/7 activity assay reagent  was added to each well
  and the luminescence signal was measured on ZS-2 plate reader. Data were normalized
  as luminescence relative to fluorescence.\n\nIn vivo experiments were carried out
  under pathogen-free conditions at the animal facility in accordance with the institutional
  guidelines of the Chengdu Medical College Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
  All protocols were reviewed and approved by IACUC and HER2-positive breast cancer
  cell line MDA-MB-453 cells were resuspended to 2106 cells/100 l in PBS and implanted
  subcutaneously into the flank region of 67-week-old female nude mice weighing 18
  to 22 gram. When tumors reached 50 to 60 mm3 in volume, animals were randomly assigned
  to 3 groups, receiving either saline  or peonidin-3-glucoside  and cyaniding-3-glucoside
  \ as oral gavage 7 times a week for a total of 25 days. Tumors were measured every
  5 days with a caliper and tumor volume  was calculated using the following formula:
  V = 4/33, where V = volume, w = width, l = length. Once the control tumors reached
  1000 mm3, the animals were euthanized due to ethical requirements. After 25 days
  treatment, all animals were euthanized using overdosed CO2, and the tumor tissues
  were extracted for immunostaining and weighing. All values are expressed as the
  mean  SEM.\n\nIn vitro data were reported as mean  SD, each treatment performed
  in duplicate or triplicate. Data were log-transformed to stabilize variances for
  proliferation assays. In vivo data were reported as mean  SEM. Values were analyzed
  using the Students t test or with one-way ANOVA when three groups were present.
  Statistical significance was considered as p0.05.\n\nFor optimization of assay performance,
  the number of cells/well and the length of the incubation period, and the volume
  of Alamar-Blue reagent were empirically determined. To identify compounds that might
  have inhibitory effect against HER2 positive cell proliferation, we used a three-step
  screen experimental approach to assess the activity of 10,000 natural compound library.
  First step, a one dose  HTS was performed using three HER2-positive breast cancer
  cell liens including BT474, MDA-MB-453, and HCC1569. Compounds that exhibited precipitation
  were excluded from the following screen. We have identified 45 compounds that inhibited
  cell proliferation by more than 50% at 10 mol/L after a 72-hour incubation. Second
  step, a one dose  screen was performed using three HER2-negative breast cancer cell
  lines including MCF-7, SUM190, and MDA-MB-231 using hit compounds from first step.
  The assay steps were summarized in Table 3. Controls present in each assay plate
  consisted of 0.2% DMSO  or afatinib. Combined with the result from first two steps,
  we have identified 8 compounds that selectively inhibited HER2-positive breast cancer
  cell proliferation by more than 50% at 10 mol/L after a 72-hour incubation  compare
  to no anti-proliferation activity against HER2-negative breast cancer cells. The
  protocol of the preliminary screen study is summarized in Table 3. A total of 543
  plates were screened. The assay performed well over the entire course of the screen
  as demonstrated by the average of Z values.\n\nThird step, hit drugs that only inhibit
  HER2-positive cell line proliferation were chosen for a quantitative screening to
  generate IC50 values as described in the Materials and Methods section. The eight
  candidatess structure were summarized in Figure 1A and were verified and their IC50
  values were confirmed. All eight compounds showed a dose-dependent inhibition of
  BT474, HCC1569, and MDA-MB-453 cell proliferation with less than 10 mol/L IC50 values.
  Based on the activities and safety profiles of the hit compounds, we prioritized
  to validate the top two hits: peonidin-3-glucoside and cyaniding-3-glucoside.\n\nFigure

  Structures of hit compounds.  Effect of peonidin-3-glucoside and cyanidin-3-glucoside
  on HER2 and downstream signaling. BT474, MDA-MB-453, and HCC1569 cells were treated
  with or without peonidin-3-glucoside or cyanidin-3-glucoside for 6 h and whole-cell
  extracts were analyzed by western blotting with the indicated antibodies.  Peonidin-3-glucoside
  and cyanidin-3-glucoside treatments induce apoptosis in MDA-MB-453, BT474, and HCC1569
  cells. Cells were treated with or without peonidin-3-glucoside or cyanidin-3-glucoside
  for 48 h and annexin V positive cells were counted using flow cytometry.  Peonidin-3-glucoside
  and cyanidin-3-glucoside treatments increase caspase 3/7 activity in MDA-MB-453,
  BT474, and HCC1569 cells. Cells were treated with or without peonidin-3-glucoside
  or cyanidin-3-glucoside for 48 h and cell viability and caspase 3/7 activity was
  measured as per the manufacturers instructions. Data were normalized as caspase
  3/7 activity divided by cell viability. Data represent mean  SEM. p;0.05, p&lt;0.01.\n\nWe
  first determined the phosphorylation status of the HER2 protein and its downstream
  mediator AKT to further confirm the anti-proliferation activities of the hit drugs
  are due to selective inhibition of HER2 protein. To evaluate the response of the
  cell lines to hit drugs, BT474, MDA-MB-453 and HCC1569 cells were treated with drugs
  \ for 6 h. Western blotting show that both peonidin-3-glucoside and cyanidin-3-glucoside
  significantly reduce the phospho-HER2, phospho-AKTs, and phopspho-p44/42MAPK levels
  compared to control cells.\n\nTo further confirm the hit compounds activity, we
  performed an Annexin V staining assay and a caspase 3/7 activity assay to detect
  apoptosis events. Our result show in Figure 1C&amp;D supported the cell viability
  assay results. Three HER2-positive breast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-453, BT474,
  and HCC1569 were treated with or without hit compounds  for 48 h. Both peonidin-3-glucoside
  and cyaniding-3-glucoside significantly induced apoptosis in all tested lines compared
  to their controls.\n\nTo assess the antitumor effect of peonidin-3-glucoside and
  cyaniding-3-glucoside in a xenograft model of HER2-positive breast cancer, MDA-MB-453
  cells were used in female nude mice. After 25 days of peonidin-3-glucoside  and
  cyaniding-3-glucoside  treatment, animal weight stayed stable during the treatments
  in each group. Animals treated with drugs did not exhibit signs of organ damage.
  Tumor growth rates were significantly different from control group. Accordingly,
  final tumor volumes  and weights  were suppressed in the peonidin-3-glucoside  and
  cyaniding-3-glucoside groups compared to the control group. This suppression was
  accompanied by decreased phospo-HER2 levels and decreased proliferation marker Ki67
  levels.\n\nFigure 2.  Antitumorigenic activity of peonidin-3-glucoside or cyaniding-3-glucoside

  and characterization of new pharmacological activities from existing Chinese Traditional
  Medicines represents an effective way to accelerate the translation of discoveries
  at the bench to clinical applications partially due to the known clinical effects
  of the drugs. To date, a number of interesting hits have been identified.\n\nIn
  the present study, we performed a three-step screen for searching anti-HER2 positive
  breast cancer agents. In step 1, we screened the entire 10,000 Chinese Traditional
  Medicine extracts library against three HER2-positive cell lines. In step 2, we
  screened the hit compounds from step 1 against three HER2-negative cell lines. In
  step 3, we generated the IC50 values for the hit compounds which selectively inhibit
  HER2-positive cell proliferation.\n\nPeonidin-3-glucoside and cyaniding-3-glucoside
  are anthocyanin pigments in colored rice cultivars. They have been reported to have
  anti-cancer properties -. Anthocyanins have been used as medicine or supplements
  for many years and it has been reported that depending on the nutrition habits,
  the daily intake of anthocyanins in humans could be up to 150 mg/day. Catalpol is
  an iridoid glucoside and exhibits anti-inflammatory and anti-diabetes activities
  . Quercetin is a natural flavonoid widely distributed in plants that acts as a neuroprotective,
  anti-cancer, anti-ROS formation agent, . Methyl protodioscin is one of the main
  bioactive extracts from the Traditional Chinese Medicine Dioscorea collettii var
  hypoglauca. Studies show that methyl protodioscin has anti-proliferative effects
  on cancer cells due to the induction of cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis, . Leonurine
  exerted cardioprotective, antioxidant, and anti-inflammation properties . Digoxin
  is a purified cardiac glycoside extracted from Digitalis lanata. Digoxin is widely
  used in the treatment of various heart conditions including atrial fibrillation,
  atrial flutter and heart failure that cannot be controlled by other medication .
  Digoxin is a very potent Na+/K+ ATPase pump inhibitor with a very narrow therapeutic
  index. Therefore extra cautious is needed when use this drug,. Europinidin is a
  water soluble, bluish red plant dye derived from Plumbago zeylanica. There is no
  citable reference for this compound regarding its activities.\n\nWe prioritized
  to study peonidin-3-glucoside and cyaniding-3-glucoside and showed significant anti-tumor
  activity in vitro. To further evaluate the efficacy of these two compounds, we conducted
  in vivo anti-tumor experiments using immune-compromised mice model. It has been
  reported that depending on the nutrition habits, the daily intake of anthocyanins
  in humans could be up to 150 mg/day. We conservatively choose the safe human dose
  as 30 mg/day to convert the dosage to the mouse equivalent does using the recommended
  conversion of animal doses to human equivalent does based on body surface area by
  US Food and Drug Administration. We calculated the equivalent doses of human  is
  equal to 6 mg/kg/day to mouse assuming the human body weight is 60 kg and the mouse
  body weight is 0.020 kg. The formula listed below has been used:\n\nBoth peonidin-3-glucoside
  and cyaniding-3-glucoside showed significant anti-tumor activity in vivo, however,
  there is no significant difference between the two treatments.\n\nIn this study,
  we screened a 10,000 Chinese Medicine extracts library against three representative
  HER2-positive breast cancer cell lines for anti-proliferation drugs and identified
  45 hits in step 1. In step 2, the hits identified from step 1 were profiled against
  three representative HER2-negative breast cancer cell lines. We identified eight
  compounds as selective anti-proliferation agents of HER2-positive breast cancer
  cells. In step 3, those eight compounds have been validated to generate IC50 values.
  Very interestingly, there are two compounds, peonidin-3-glucoside and cyaniding-3-glucoside
  were extracted from the same source. To initiate the validation, we also tested
  the ability of these drugs to induce the early apoptosis and further confirmed the
  anti-proliferation abilities. Studies using nude mice bearing MDA-MB-453 cells confirmed
  the antitumorgenic effects of peonidin-3-glucoside and cyaniding-3-glucoside treatments
  in vivo. In conclusion, the discovery of HER2 selective anti-proliferation of breast
  cancer cells by Chinese Traditional Medicines have important implications in the
  development of these drugs as new anti-breast cancer agents.\n\nWe would like to
