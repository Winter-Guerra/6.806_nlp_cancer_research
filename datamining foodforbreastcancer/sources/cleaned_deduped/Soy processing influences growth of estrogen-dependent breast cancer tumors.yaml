  Soy-based products consumed in Asian countries are minimally processed whereas in
  the USA many of the soy foods and soy ingredients are highly processed. Soy foods
  contain complex mixtures of bioactive compounds, which may interact with one another.
  The objective of this study was to evaluate the ability of various soy products
  containing genistin, the glycoside form of genistein, to affect growth of MCF-7
  cells transplanted into ovariectomized athymic mice. Products investigated included
  soy flour, two crude extracts of soy, a mixture of isoflavones and genistin in pure
  form. Each of the soy flour-processed products was added to the diet to provide
  equivalent amounts of genistein aglycone equivalents. Tumors in the negative control
  animals regressed throughout the study while the tumors in the soy flour-fed animals
  remained basically the same size. In animals consuming soy molasses, Novasoy, mixed
  isoflavones or genistin alone, tumor growth was stimulated when compared with animals
  consuming a control diet devoid of soy. These same dietary treatments resulted in
  increased cellular proliferation. Changes in mRNA expression of gene targets  in
  tumors induced by the different diets were evaluated. The relative expression of
  pS2, progesterone receptor and cyclin D1 was increased in animals consuming the
  Novasoy, mixed isoflavones and genistin. Bcl2 mRNA expression was low in most of
  the dietary treatment groups compared with positive  controls. Aromatase expression
  was not affected in any of the treatment groups. The degree of soy flour processing
  affects the estrogenicity of products containing a constant amount of genistein.
  Collectively, these findings suggest that for postmenopausal women with estrogen-dependent
  breast cancer, the consumption of foods containing soy flour is more advisable than
  consuming isoflavones in more purified forms. '
