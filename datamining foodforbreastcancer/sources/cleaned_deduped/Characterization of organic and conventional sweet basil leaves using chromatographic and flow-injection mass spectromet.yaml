  Sweet basil, Ocimum basilicum, is one of the most important and wildly used spices
  and has been shown to have antioxidant, antibacterial, and anti-diarrheal activities.
  In this study, high performance liquid chromatographic  and flow-injection mass
  spectrometric  fingerprinting techniques were used to differentiate organic and
  conventional sweet basil leaf samples. Principal component analysis  of the fingerprints
  indicated that both HPLC and FIMS fingerprints could effectively detect the chemical
  differences in the organic and conventional sweet basil leaf samples. This study
  suggested that the organic basil sample contained greater concentrations of almost
  all the major compounds than its conventional counterpart on a per same botanical
  weight basis. The FIMS method was able to rapidly differentiate the organic and
  conventional sweet basil leaf samples, whereas the HPLC fingerprints provided more
  information about the chemical composition of the basil samples with a longer analytical
  time.'
