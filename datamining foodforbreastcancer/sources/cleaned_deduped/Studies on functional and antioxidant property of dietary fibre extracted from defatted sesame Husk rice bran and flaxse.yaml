  on functional and antioxidant property of dietary fibre extracted from defatted
  sesame Husk rice bran and flaxse.md
text: '


  The study describes the preparation of functional food ingredient from by-product
  of vegetable oil industry. Accumulating evidence favours the view that increased
  intake of dietary fibre in an otherwise low fibre diet can have beneficial effects
  in both human and experimental animals. These benefits include prevention or alleviation
  of maladies such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, diverticulosis and colon cancer.
  Studies have repeatedly shown that defatted oil bearing materials  give interesting
  health benefits. Compositional analysis reveals that sesame husk, rice bran and
  flaxseed consists of almost 68%, 27% and 39% dietary fibre respectively and has
  been reported to have positive health effects, such as in the form of a laxative
  and cholesterol-lowering agent. This suggests that sesame husk, rice bran and flaxseed
  are good fibre sources that can be added to various food products. This study examined
  the effectiveness of a dietary fibre preparation, derived from these sources, as
  a functional ingredient with potential of antioxidant activity. The observations
  established that dietary fibre from defatted flaxseed and rice bran had higher water
  binding, oil binding and emulsifying capacity compared to sesame husk dietary fibre.
  However, rice bran and sesame husk fibre were found to be less viscous than flaxseed
  fibre. Whereas in case of antioxidant activity rice bran fibre showed higher activity
  than flaxseed and sesame husk. The study confirms that the dietary fibre preparation
  from defatted sesame husk, rice bran and flaxseed have great potential in food applications,
  especially in development of functional foods.'
