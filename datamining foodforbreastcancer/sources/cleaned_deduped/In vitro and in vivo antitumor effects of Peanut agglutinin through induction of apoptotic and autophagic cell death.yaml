  vitro and in vivo antitumor effects of Peanut agglutinin through induction of apoptotic
  and autophagic cell death.md
text: '


  In this study we unravel the mechanism underlying the antitumorigenic effects of
  Peanut agglutinin  isolated from Arachis hypogea in Daltons lymphoma  bearing mice
  and elucidated the mechanism in vitro in HeLa cells. In vivo PNA administration
  at 1 and 2 mg/kg body weight reduced DL proliferation with increase in autophagic
  and apoptotic characteristics. In vitro data showed that PNA at 0.1-100 g/ml dose
  exhibit selective antiproliferative activity on various cancer cell lines without
  displaying cytotoxic effect on normal cells. However, heat denatured PNA failed
  to show any antiproliferative activity. Moreover, PNA was found to induce autophagic
  and apoptotic cell death in HeLa cells. Exponential increase in reactive oxygen
  species  was proved to be the master signal for promoting PNA induced cell death
  in HeLa cells. Interestingly, when HeLa cells were pre-exposed with N-acetylcysteine  and
  followed to PNA treatment, there was sharp decline in autophagy, apoptosis and a
  concomitant abrogation of antiproliferative potential. PNA at lower doses was also
  seen to inflict senescence. Hence, this common culinary item derived molecule whose
  discovery dates back to late 1970s was for the first time evaluated mechanistically
  in vivo and in vitro as a novel naturally occurring therapeutic agent against cancer.'
