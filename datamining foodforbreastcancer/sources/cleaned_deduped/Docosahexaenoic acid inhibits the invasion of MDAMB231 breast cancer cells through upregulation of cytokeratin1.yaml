text: '


  Docosahexaenoic acid, the main member of the omega-3 essential fatty acid family,
  has been shown to reduce the invasion of the triplenegative breast cancer cell line
  MDAMB231, but the mechanism involved remains unclear. In the present study, a proteomic
  approach was used to define changes in protein expression induced by DHA. Proteins
  from crude membrane preparations of MDAMB231 cells treated with 100 M DHA were separated
  by twodimensional electrophoresis  and differentially expressed proteins were identified
  using MALDITOF mass spectrometry. The main changes observed were the upregulation
  of Keratin, type  cytoskeletal 1, catalase and laminA/C. Immunocytochemistry analyses
  confirmed the increase in KRT1 induced by DHA. Furthermore, in vitro invasion assays
  showed that siRNA against KRT1 was able to reverse the DHAinduced inhibition of
  breast cancer cell invasion. In conclusion, KRT1 is involved in the antiinvasive
  activity of DHA in breast cancer cells.'
