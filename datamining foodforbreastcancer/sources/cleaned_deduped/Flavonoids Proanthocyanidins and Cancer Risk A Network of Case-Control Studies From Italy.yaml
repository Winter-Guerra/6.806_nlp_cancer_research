  Proanthocyanidins and Cancer Risk A Network of Case-Control Studies From Italy.md
text: '


  We considered flavonoids and proanthocyanidins in a network of multicentric Italian
  case-control studies including about 10,000 incident, histologically confirmed cases
  of selected cancers and over 16,000 controls. Odds ratios  for the highest vs. the
  lowest quintile of 6 classes of flavonoids and proanthocyanidins were estimated
  by multiple logistic regression models. Total flavonoids, flavanones, and flavonols
  were inversely related to oral and laryngeal cancers. Flavanols were also inversely
  related to laryngeal cancer, whereas flavanones were inversely related to esophageal
  cancer. A reduced risk of colorectal cancer was found for high intake of anthocyanidins,
  flavonols, flavones, and isoflavones. Inverse relations with breast cancer were
  found for flavones  and flavonols. Flavonols  and isoflavones  were inversely associated
  to ovarian cancer, whereas flavonols  and flavones  were inversely associated to
  renal cancer. No association between flavonoids and prostate cancer emerged. We
  found inverse associations between proanthocyanidins and colorectal cancer. These
  associations appeared stronger for proanthocyanidins with a higher degree of polymerization.'
