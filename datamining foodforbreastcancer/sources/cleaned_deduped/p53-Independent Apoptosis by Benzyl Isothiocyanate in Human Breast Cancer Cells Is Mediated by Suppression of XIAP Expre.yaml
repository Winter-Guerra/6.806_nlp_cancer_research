  Apoptosis by Benzyl Isothiocyanate in Human Breast Cancer Cells Is Mediated by Suppression
  of XIAP Expre.md

  We have shown previously that cruciferous vegetable constituent benzyl isothiocyanate  suppresses
  viability of cultured MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells and retards
  mammary cancer development in MMTV-neu mice by causing apoptosis, but the mechanism
  of cell death is not fully understood. We now show that whereas p53 is dispensable
  for BITC-induced cell death, proapoptotic response to this promising chemopreventive
  agent is mediated by suppression of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis  protein expression.
  The BITC treatment increased levels of total and Ser15-phosphorylated p53 protein
  in MCF-7 cells, but the proapoptotic response to this agent was maintained even
  after knockdown of the p53 protein level. Exposure of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells
  to BITC resulted in a marked decrease in protein level of XIAP as early as 8 hours
  after treatment. Ectopic expression of XIAP conferred statistically significant
  protection against BITC-mediated cytoplasmic histone-associated apoptotic DNA fragmentation
  in both cell lines. Moreover, inhibition of MDA-MB-231 cell growth in vivo in female
  athymic mice by BITC administration correlated with a modest but statistically significant
  decrease in XIAP protein level in the tumor xenograft. The BITC treatment also resulted
  in induction as well as nuclear translocation of survivin only in the MCF-7 cells.
  The BITC-induced apoptosis was modestly but statistically significantly augmented
  by RNA interference of survivin in MCF-7 cells. In conclusion, the present study
  provides novel insight into the molecular circuitry of BITC-induced apoptosis to
  indicate suppression of XIAP expression as a critical mediator of this process.
