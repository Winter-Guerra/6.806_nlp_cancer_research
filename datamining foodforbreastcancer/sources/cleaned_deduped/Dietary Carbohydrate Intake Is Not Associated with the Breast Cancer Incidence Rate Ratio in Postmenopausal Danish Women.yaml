  Carbohydrate Intake Is Not Associated with the Breast Cancer Incidence Rate Ratio
  in Postmenopausal Danish Women.md
text: '


  Although many case-control studies have suggested positive associations between
  carbohydrate intake and breast cancer incidence rates in both pre- and postmenopausal
  women, there is limited information available from cohort studies. We examined the
  effect of the intake of different carbohydrates, the glycemic index, and the glycemic
  load on breast cancer incidence in postmenopausal women taking into consideration
  tumor estrogen receptor status. Postmenopausal women  participated in the Diet,
  Cancer, and Health study, and provided information about diet and established risk
  factors for breast cancer. During follow-up, we identified 634 incidents of breast
  cancer. Associations between carbohydrate intake and breast cancer incidence were
  analyzed using Coxs regression models. There was no association for intake of glucose,
  fructose, sucrose, maltose, lactose, or starch and breast cancer incidence rate,
  and no association for glycemic index or glycemic load after adjusting for confounding
  factors. Intake of different carbohydrates was not associated with breast cancer
  incidence rates for either estrogen receptor positive  or  breast cancer. Similarly,
  glycemic index and glycemic load were not associated with ER+ breast cancer after
  adjusting for confounding factors. A borderline significant positive association
  between glycemic index and  breast cancer was observed. In conclusion, we found
  no clear associations between intake of different carbohydrates, total carbohydrate
  intake, glycemic index, or glycemic load and breast cancer incidence in postmenopausal
  women. Furthermore, when ER+ and ER breast cancer cases were analyzed separately,
  no clear associations were observed. '
