  Angiogenesis plays an important role in tumor progression. Piperine, a major alkaloid
  constituent of black pepper, has diverse physiological actions including killing
  of cancer cells; however, the effect of piperine on angiogenesis is not known. Here
  we show that piperine inhibited the proliferation and G1/S transition of human umbilical
  vein endothelial cells  without causing cell death. Piperine also inhibited HUVEC
  migration and tubule formation in vitro, as well as collagen-induced angiogenic
  activity by rat aorta explants and breast cancer cell-induced angiogenesis in chick
  embryos. Although piperine binds to and activates the cation channel transient receptor
  potential vanilloid 1, its effects on endothelial cells did not involve TRPV1 since
  the antiproliferative effect of piperine was not affected by TRPV1-selective antagonists,
  nor did HUVECs express detectable TRPV1 mRNA. Importantly, piperine inhibited phosphorylation
  of Ser 473 and Thr 308 residues of Akt, which is a key regulator of endothelial
  cell function and angiogenesis. Consistent with Akt inhibition as the basis of piperines
  action on HUVECs, inhibition of the phosphoinositide-3 kinase/Akt signaling pathway
  with LY-294002 also inhibited HUVEC proliferation and collagen-induced angiogenesis.
  Taken together, these data support the further investigation of piperine as an angiogenesis
  inhibitor for use in cancer treatment.'
