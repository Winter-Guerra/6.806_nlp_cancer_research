  Intakes in Older Girls and Risk of Benign Breast Disease in Young Women.md
text: '


  Previous investigations found high dairy intakes in girls associated with rapid
  height growth and excess weight gain, which had opposite relationships with benign
  breast disease  in young women. We use data from the longitudinal Growing Up Today
  Study  to investigate whether dairy intakes, in older children/adolescents, are
  associated with BBD risk in young women. GUTS includes 9,039 females, ages 915 years
  in 1996, who completed questionnaires annually through 2001, then in 2003, 2005,
  2007, and 2010. Dietary food frequencies  obtained milk, yogurt, and cheese intakes.
  On 20052010 surveys, 7,011 females  reported whether a health care provider ever
  diagnosed them with BBD  and if confirmed by breast biopsy. Logistic regression
  models estimated associations between prevalent biopsy-confirmed BBD and dairy intakes,
  adjusted for age and energy. Multivariable-adjusted models additionally included
  menarche age, childhood adiposity, adolescent alcohol consumption, and pregnancy.
  Further analyses stratified by family history. Age-energyadjusted models of dairy  intakes
  at 14 yr found no significant associations with BBD risk [milk: OR, 0.90/; 95% confidence
  interval, 0.761.05; dairy protein: OR, 0.98/; 95% CI, 0.821.17). Separate analyses
  of dairy intakes at 10 yr, intakes before the growth spurt, during the growth spurt,
  before menses-onset, and after menses-onset provided no significant associations
  with BBD. Multivariable adjustment, and family history stratification, did not alter
  the above findings. We conclude that dairy intakes by older girls have no strong
  relation with BBD risk in young women. Because of small number of cases, it is important
  to continue follow-up and re-examine later. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev; 22;
