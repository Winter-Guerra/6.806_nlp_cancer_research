text: '


  In breast cancer cells, overexpression of human epidermal growth factor receptor
  2  increases the translation of fatty acid synthase  by altering the activity of
  PI3K/Akt signaling pathways. Cancer chemotherapy causes major side effects and is
  not effective enough in slowing down the progression of the disease. Earlier studies
  showed a role for resveratrol in the inhibition of FASN, but the molecular mechanisms
  of resveratrol-induced inhibition are not known. In the present study, we examined
  the novel mechanism of resveratrol on Her2-overexpressed breast cancer cells.'
