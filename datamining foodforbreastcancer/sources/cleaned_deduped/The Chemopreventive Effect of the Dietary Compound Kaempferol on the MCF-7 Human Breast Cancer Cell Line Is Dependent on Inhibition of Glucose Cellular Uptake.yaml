  Cancer Cell Line Is Dependent on Inhibition of Glucose Cellular Uptake.md
text: '


  Our aim was to investigate the effect of several dietary polyphenols on glucose
  uptake by breast cancer cells. Uptake of 3H-deoxy-D-glucose  by MCF-7 cells was
  time-dependent, saturable, and inhibited by cytochalasin B plus phloridzin. In the
  short-term, myricetin, chrysin, genistein, resveratrol, kaempferol, and xanthohumol  inhibited
  3H-DG uptake. Kaempferol was found to be the most potent inhibitor of 3H-DG uptake,
  behaving as a mixed-type inhibitor. In the long-term, kaempferol  was also able
  to inhibit 3H-DG uptake, associated with a 40% decrease in GLUT1 mRNA levels. Interestingly
  enough, kaempferol  revealed antiproliferative  and cytotoxic  properties, which
  were mimicked by low extracellular  glucose conditions and reversed by high extracellular  glucose
  conditions. Finally, exposure of cells to kaempferol  induced an increase in extracellular
  lactate levels over time, due to inhibition of MCT1-mediated lactate cellular uptake.
  In conclusion, kaempferol potently inhibits glucose uptake by MCF-7 cells, apparently
  by decreasing GLUT1-mediated glucose uptake. The antiproliferative and cytotoxic
  effect of kaempferol in these cells appears to be dependent on this effect.'
