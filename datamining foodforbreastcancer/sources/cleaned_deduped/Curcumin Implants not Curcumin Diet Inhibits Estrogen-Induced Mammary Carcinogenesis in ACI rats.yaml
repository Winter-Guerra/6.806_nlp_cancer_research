  Implants not Curcumin Diet Inhibits Estrogen-Induced Mammary Carcinogenesis in ACI

  Curcumin is widely known for its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiproliferative
  activities in cell-culture studies. However, poor oral bioavailability limited its
  efficacy in animal and clinical studies. Recently, we developed polymeric curcumin
  implants that circumvent oral bioavailability issues, and tested their potential
  against 17-estradiol mediated mammary tumorigenesis. Female Augustus Copenhagen
  Irish  rats were administered curcumin either via diet  or via polymeric curcumin
  implants  4 days before grafting a subcutaneous E2 silastic implant. Curcumin implants
  were changed after 4.5 months to provide higher curcumin dose at the appearance
  of palpable tumors. The animals were euthanized after 3 weeks, 3 months, and after
  the tumor incidence reached &gt;80%  in control animals. The curcumin administered
  via implants resulted in significant reduction in both the tumor multiplicity  and
  tumor volume ; the dietary curcumin, however, was ineffective. Dietary curcumin
  increased hepatic CYP1A and CYP1B1 activities without any effect on CYP3A4 activity,
  whereas curcumin implants increased both CYP1A and CYP3A4 activities but decreased
  CYP1B1 activity in the presence of E2. Because CYP1A and CYP3A4 metabolize most
  of the E2 to its noncarcinogenic 2-OH metabolite, and CYP1B1 produces potentially
  carcinogenic 4-OH metabolite, favorable modulation of these CYPs via systemically
  delivered curcumin could be one of the potential mechanisms. The analysis of plasma
  and liver by high-performance liquid chromatography showed substantially higher
  curcumin levels via implants versus the dietary route despite substantially higher
  dose administered. Cancer Prev Res; 7; 45665. 2014 AACR. '
