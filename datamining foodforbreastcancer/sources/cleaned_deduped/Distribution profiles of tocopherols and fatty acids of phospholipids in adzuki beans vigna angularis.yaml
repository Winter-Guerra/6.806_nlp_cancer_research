  profiles of tocopherols and fatty acids of phospholipids in adzuki beans vigna angularis.md
text: "\n\nExtracted lipids from adzuki beans  were determined by high-performance
  liquid chromatography for tocopherol homologues. Fatty acid distributions of triacylglycerols
  \ and major phospholipids  were analyzed by gas chromatography, and their tocopherol
  contents were determined. -Tocopherol was present in highest concentration, and
  -tocopherol in small amounts. However, \\- and -tocopherols were not detected in
  adzuki beans. The major lipid components were PL  and TAG, while other components
  were also present in minor proportions. The major PL components were phosphatidylcholine,
  phosphatidylethanolamine  and phosphatidylinositol. The positional distribution
  of fatty acids in these PLs was evident in the beans: unsaturated fatty acids were
  predominantly located in the sn-2 position, while saturated fatty acids primary
  occupied the sn-1 position in these lipids.\n\nThis study describes the characteristics
  of lipid components, positional distribution of fatty acids in the major phospholipids
  as well as the tocopherol profiles of adzuki beans. These results were not similar
  to the positional fatty acid distributions in the oilseeds such as peanuts, soybeans
  and sesame seeds. The data obtained would be useful to both consumers and producers
  for manufacturing traditional adzuki confectionaries  in Japan and elsewhere.\n\nAdzuki
  or small red beans  are a popular ingredient in many confections in the orient.
  The consumption of adzuki is concentrated in Japan, where the bean has an important
  economic value. The predominant use of adzuki in traditional Japanese confections
  is wagashi such as youkan, manju and amanatoo. Adzuki beans serve as a rich source
  of carbohydrates, protein, fiber, vitamins and minerals. When adzuki beans are used
  for confectionaries, they are boiled in a cooker and yield a hot water extract as
  a by-product, which is known to contain active ingredients, but is washed. It has
  been reported that the 40% ethanol fraction of hot water extract from adzuki beans
  suppresses not only the proliferation of human stomach cancer cells in culture but
  also benzo  pyrene-induced tumorigenesis in the mouse forestomach. Wu et al.  have
  recently shown that a water-soluble extract of the adzuki bean could inhibit acetaminophen-induced
  liver damage. Han et al.  have reported the protective action of an adzuki extract
  against acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity via a hepatic GSH-mediated antioxidant/detoxification
  system in rat liver after 4 weeks of feeding.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, however,
  no data are available on the positional distribution of fatty acids in the major
  phospholipids  obtained from adzuki beans. The objective of the present study was
  to determine the lipid class compositions, the fatty acid profiles of PLs and the
  tocopherol contents of adzuki beans. The data obtained should be useful to both
  producers and consumers for manufacturing traditional adzuki confectionaries.\n\nThe
  commercially available mature adzuki beans  used in this study were harvested in
  Japan  during the summer of 2006. The cultivar  was selected for uniformity-based
  seed weight of 210-240 mg per bean. Beans were divided into groups and stored in
  separate stainless steel containers at 4C prior to the experiment.\n\nVitamin E
  homologues  were purchased from Eisai Co.. All tocopherols were of the D-form, and
  their purities were better than 98.5% as determined by high-performance liquid chromatography
  \ using 2,2,5,7,8-pentamethyl-6-hydroxychroman as internal standard, as described
  in a later section.\n\nAll chemicals and solvents used were of analytical grade.
  However, diethyl ether was further purified to remove peroxides. Thin-layer chromatography
  -precoated silica gel 60 plates  were purchased from Merck. The TLC standard mixture
  containing monoacylglycerols, diacylglycerols, free fatty acids, triacylglycerols,
  steryl esters  and hydrocarbons  was purchased from Nacalai Tesque. A PL kit from
  Serdary Research Laboratory  was used as PL standard. Phospholipase A2 was from
  a bee  venom and obtained from Sigma Chemical Co.. Methyl pentadecanoate  was dissolved
  in n-hexane  and used as internal standard. Boron trifluoride  in methanol  was
  used to prepare fatty acid methyl esters.\n\nThe AOAC  methods were used to determine
  the chemical composition of the adzuki beans. The beans were analyzed in triplicate
  for fat, protein and moisture contents according to the standard methods. Fat content
  was determined by solvent extraction, protein content by the Kjeldahl method  and
  moisture content by oven drying to constant weight at 105C.\n\nThe beans  were extracted
  using a Maxim homogenizer  at high speed for 10 min at 0C with 200 mL of chloroform/methanol
  \ fortified with butylated hydroxytoluene, which was added to inhibit the oxidative
  degradation of lipids during analysis. The homogenate was vacuum filtered through
  defatted filter paper  on a Buchner funnel, and the filter residue was rehomogenized
  with a second volume of chloroform/methanol. The filtrates were combined and dried
  in a rotary vacuum evaporator at 35C. The residue was dissolved in 100 mL of chloroform/methanol
  ; then, 20 mL aqueous potassium chloride  was added, and the phases were mixed vigorously.
  After phase separation, the chloroform layer was withdrawn, dried over anhydrous
  sodium sulfate and filtered, and the filtrate was concentrated under vacuum. The
  extracted lipids were weighed to determine the lipid content of the beans and then
  transferred to a 25-mL brown glass volumetric flask with chloroform/methanol.\n\nAnalysis
  of tocopherols in the oils was performed by HPLC as described earlier. A mixture
  of n-hexane/1,4-dioxane/ethanol  was used as the mobile phase at a flow rate of
  2.0 mL/min. A 0.2-mL portion of the sample, after removal of the extraction solvents,
  under a stream of nitrogen, was placed in a 5-mL brown volumetric flask and diluted
  with the mobile phase. An aliquot  from this sample solution was injected using
  the same method as described earlier, and the amount of each tocopherol was monitored
  with a fluorescence detector  set at 295 nm excitation wavelength and 320 nm emission
  wavelength, and were quantified as previously described.\n\nUsing previously described
  methods, the total lipids were fractionated by TLC into eight fractions. Bands corresponding
  to HC, SE, TAG, FFA, 1,3-DAG, 1,2-DAG, MAG and PL were scraped separately into test
  tubes. Methyl pentadecanoate  from a standard solution  was added to each tube as
  internal standard with a microsyringe. Part of the polar lipids was further separated
  by TLC into several zones with chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/deionized water  as
  the mobile phase. Each band was located by exposure to iodine vapor, and PL classes
  were identified not only by comparison with Rf values of standard PL similarly chromatographed,
  but also by specific reagents: Dragendorff reagent for choline lipids, 0.25% ninhydrin
  in acetone for amino-containing lipids and molybdate reagent for PL. Bands corresponding
  to phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine  and phosphatidylinositol  and
  others were scraped carefully into test tubes, respectively, and methyl pentadecanoate
  \ was added as described earlier.\n\nWith an exception of HC, FAMEs were prepared
  from the isolated lipids by heating with silica gel for 30 min at 80C in BF3-methanol
  on an aluminum block bath. After cooling, 5 mL of n-hexane was added to each tube
  and was washed several times with deionized water to remove BF3 and silica gel.
  The n-hexane layer containing the FAME was recovered and dried over anhydrous sodium
  sulfate. The solvent was then vaporized under a gentle stream of nitrogen, and the
  residue was quantified in a gas chromatograph   equipped with a hydrogen flame ionization
  detector and a capillary column  at a column temperature of 180C. The injection
  and detector temperatures were held at 220 and 250C, respectively. The initial oven
  temperature was 180C. This temperature was maintained for 5 min and then increased
  at a rate of 2C/min to 200C, which was held for 15 min. Helium was used as carrier
  gas at a flow rate of 1.5 mL/min, and the GC was operated under a constant pressure
  of 180 kPa. All samples were dissolved in n-hexane for injection.\n\nThe component
  peaks were identified and calibrated by comparison with those of standard FAMEs
  \ using an electronic integrator. The detection limit was 0.05 wt % of total fatty
  acids for each FAME in a FAME mixture, and the results were expressed as wt % of
  total FAMEs.\n\nThe positional distribution of fatty acids in each of the PE, PC
  and PI samples isolated by preparative TLC was determined by phospholipase A2 hydrolysis.
  Briefly, 3-7 mg of each PL was suspended in 0.5 mL of 0.25 M Tris buffer  containing
  0.01 M CaCl2 in a 10-mL Erlenmeyer flask. To this suspension, 5 mg of phospholipase
  A2 and 10 mL of diethyl ether were added. The reaction mixture was incubated at
  28C for up to 10 h with continuous shaking under a nitrogen atmosphere. The hydrolysis
  was almost complete  in this period, as judged from a preliminary experiment using
  a standard PL. Diethyl ether was evaporated under nitrogen, and samples were extracted
  with chloroform/methanol. To obtain the different products after this hydrolysis,
  the lipid extracts were subjected to one-dimensional TLC with chloroform/methanol/deionized
  water. The spots were visualized with iodine vapor, and the bands corresponding
  to the FFAs and lysophospholipids were separately scraped into test tubes. The constituent
  fatty acids were analyzed by GC after methylation as described earlier.\n\nAll preparations
  and measurements were carried out in triplicate, and the data were subjected to
  one-way analysis of variance. Duncans multiple range test was performed to determine
  any significant differences  among treatments.\n\nThe tocopherol contents in the
  oils prepared from adzuki beans are shown in Fig. 1. The major tocopherol was -tocopherol,
  and -tocopherol  was a minor component. -Tocopherol is a more potent antioxidant
  in oils than other tocopherols. However, \\- and -tocopherols were not detected
  in adzuki beans. This distribution pattern is a very unique one and differs from
  other plant seeds such as sunflower seeds  or peanuts  in which \\- and -tocopherols
  are usually detected.\n\nFigure 1\\. TOCOPHEROL CONTENTS IN ADZUKI BEANS Each value
  shows the average of three replicates. Horizontal bars depict the standard error
  of the replicates.\n\nThe major chemical components of adzuki beans were: moisture
  3.9%, fat 2.5% and protein 20.3%. Adzuki beans are high in complex carbohydrates,
  protein and fiber, yet are extremely low in fat. The compositional analyses carried
  out in this study included determination of the lipid classes and the fatty acid
  compositions of the oils. Profiles of different lipid classes in the beans are shown
  in Table 1. Predominant components were PL, followed by TAG  and SE, accompanied
  by very little amounts of HC, FFA, 1,3-DAG, 1,2-DAG  and MAG. Adzuki beans are not
  oilseeds but typical vegetable seeds. Therefore, PL content is quite significant,
  whereas glycolipids are present only in trace amounts, indicating that PLs form
  the principal components of the cell membranes in the beans. Adzuki beans contain
  considerable amounts of phenolic compounds  that possess varying degrees of antioxidant
  activity. Further investigation should be carried out to clarify the interrelation
  between the PL and phenolic compounds in adzuki beans.  \n\nTo clarify the distribution
  of major PL in the beans, further separation of the PL fraction into several fractions
  \ was carried out using TLC in the presence of authentic standards. Table 2 shows
  the profiles of PL components of the beans. The original amounts of each PL were
  approximately 408.1 mg, 680.2 mg  and 340.0 mg  per 100 g beans for PE, PC and PI,
  respectively. These PLs form the principal components of the cell membranes in the
  beans. Because membrane lipids are involved in such fundamental cell processes as
  ion transport, energy generation and biological reactions, they are highly conserved
  in terms of both quantity and quality. This may explain why the fatty acid composition
  in newly differentiated tissue was conserved regardless of genotype.  \n\nFatty
  acid distributions  of total lipids, TAG and PL in the beans are shown in Fig. 2.
  The principal fatty acid components of legumes are generally palmitic, stearic,
  oleic, linoleic  and -linolenic  acids, the distribution of which varies according
  to the three lipid classes. Moreover, long-chain saturated fatty acids  were also
  detected at low percentages  in the TAG. The samples had high amounts of total unsaturated
  fatty acids which consisted mainly of linoleic acid, followed by -linolenic  and
  oleic  acids, representing 71.2, 59.2 and 55.6% of total lipids, TAG and PL, respectively.
  Some differences  in fatty acid composition existed when comparing the three lipid
  classes. With a few exceptions, the percentage of palmitic acid  was higher  in
  the PL, while -linolenic acid  was higher  in the TAG. However, the percentage of
  linoleic acid  was less  in the TAG than that in the total lipids or PL. These profiles
  in the fatty acid distributions are not similar to the results reported in typical
  vegetable seeds such as kidney beans  or peas.\n\nFigure 2\\. FATTY ACID DISTRIBUTIONS

  value shows the average of three replicates. Vertical bars depict the standard error
  of the replicates. Other minor fatty acids include 14:0, 16:1, 20:0, 22:0 and 24:0.\n\nThe
  compositions of fatty acids in PE, PC and PI were compared. The major fatty acids
  in the three PLs were palmitic, stearic, oleic, linoleic and -linolenic acids. These
  distribution patterns were very similar to each other between PE and PC, whereas
  PI was unique in that it had the highest saturated fatty acid contents  among the
  three PLs. With a few exceptions, however, the positional distribution of fatty
  acids in PE, PC and PI was observed in these major PLs: saturated fatty acids were
  mostly located in the sn-1 position while unsaturated fatty acids predominantly
  occupied the sn-2 position of these molecules. The data are not necessarily identical
  with those of other plant seeds reported in the literature.\n\nFigure 3\\. POSITIONAL

  the average of three replicates. Vertical bars depict the standard error of the
  replicates. Other minor fatty acids include 14:0, 16:1, 2:0, 22:0 and 24:0.\n\nThe
  dominant components in adzuki beans were PL and TAG, whereas other lipid components
  were also present in minor proportions. -Tocopherol was present in the highest concentration,
  and -tocopherol was present in minor amounts. PC was detected as the dominant component,
  followed by PE  and PI. The principal characteristics of fatty acid distributions
  were evident in the major PL; unsaturated fatty acids, especially linoleic and -linolenic
  acids, were more concentrated in the sn-2 position, while saturated fatty acids,
  palmitic and stearic acids primarily occupied the sn-1 position in these lipids.
  These results would be useful to both producers and consumers for manufacturing
  traditional Japanese adzuki confectionaries.\n\nThe authors thank Prof. Bruce Holub
