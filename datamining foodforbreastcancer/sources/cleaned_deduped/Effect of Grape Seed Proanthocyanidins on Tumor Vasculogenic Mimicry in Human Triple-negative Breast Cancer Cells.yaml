  Vasculogenic mimicry  refers to the unique ability of highly aggressive tumor cells
  to mimic the pattern of embryonic vasculogenesis, which was associated with invasion
  and metastasis. The grape seed proanthocyanidins  had attracted much attention as
  a potential bioactive anti-carcinogenic agent. However, GSPs regulation of VM and
  its possible mechanisms in a triple-negative breast cancer cells  remain not clear.
  Therefore, we examined the effect of GSPs on VM information in HCC1937 cell model.
  In this study, we identified the VM structure via the three-dimensional  matrix
  in vitro. Cell viability was measured using the CCK8 assay. The effects of GSPs
  on human triple-negative breast cancer cells  HCC1937 in terms of related proteins
  of VM information were determined using western blot analysis. In vitro, the tubular
  networks were found in highly invasive HCC1937 cells but not in the non-invasive
  MCF-7 cells when plated on matrigel. The number of vascular channels was significantly
  reduced when cells were exposed in GSPs  and GSPs  groups. Furthermore, we found
  that treatment with GSPs promoted transition of the mesenchymal state to the epithelial
  state in HCC1937 cells as well as reducing the expression of Twist1 protein, a master
  EMT regulator.GSPs has the ability to inhibit VM information by the suppression
  of Twist1 protein that could be related to the reversal of epithelial-to-mesenchymal  process.
  It is firstly concluded that GSPs may be an potential anti-VM botanical agent for
  human TNBCs.'
