  Being Cordyceps militaris  Link recognized as a medicinal and edible mushroom, this
  work intends to reveal new interesting bioactive molecules that could be isolated
  from this species. Hydrophilic and lipophilic compounds were analyzed by chromatographic
  techniques coupled to different detectors. The methanolic extract of C. militaris
  was tested for its antioxidant, antibacterial, antifungal and anti-proliferative
  properties in different human tumor cell lines. Mannitol  and trehalose  were the
  free sugars found in C. militaris. Polyunsaturated fatty acids  predominated over
  saturated fatty acids  and -tocopherol was the only isoform of vitamin E detected.
  The organic acids found in this mushroom were oxalic, citric and fumaric acids.
  p-Hydroxybenzoic acid was the only phenolic acid quantified in this species ; although
  cinnamic acid was also found. The methanolic extract of C. militaris proved to inhibit
  lipid peroxidation, have reducing power and scavenge free radicals. This extract
  also revealed strong antibacterial and antifungal properties. Finally, the C. militaris
  extract was able to inhibit the proliferation of MCF-7, NCI-H460, HCT-15  and HeLa  human
  carcinoma cell lines.'
