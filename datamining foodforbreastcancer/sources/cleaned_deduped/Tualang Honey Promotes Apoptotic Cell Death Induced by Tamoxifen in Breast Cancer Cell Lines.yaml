  Honey Promotes Apoptotic Cell Death Induced by Tamoxifen in Breast Cancer Cell Lines.md
text: "\n\nTualang honey  is rich in flavonoids and phenolic acids and has significant
  anticancer activity against breast cancer cells comparable to the effect of tamoxifen,
  in vitro. The current study evaluated the effects of TH when used in combination
  with TAM on MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. We observed that TH promoted the anticancer
  activity of TAM in both the estrogen receptor-responsive and ER-nonresponsive human
  breast cancer cell lines. Flow cytometric analyses indicated accelerated apoptosis
  especially in MDA-MB-231 cells and with the involvement of caspase-3/7, -8 and -9
  activation as shown by fluorescence microscopy. Depolarization of the mitochondrial
  membrane was also increased in both cell lines when TH was used in combination with
  TAM compared to TAM treatment alone. TH may therefore be a potential adjuvant to
  be used with TAM for reducing the dose of TAM, hence, reducing TAM-induced adverse
  effects.\n\nChemotherapy is an important component of adjuvant treatment for breast
  cancer. However, the efficacy of chemotherapeutic drugs in cancer treatment is hampered
  by the development of drug resistance in cancer cells, contributed by various factors.
  These include individual metabolic variations, genetic and epigenetic heterogeneity
  in tumor cells, and acquired resistance due to expression of drug transporters which
  limit accumulation of drugs within cells. Administration of chemotherapeutic drugs
  to cancer patients also produces undesired side effects due to indiscriminate effects
  on normal and tumor cells in the patients body. It is reported that more than 70%
  of breast cancers are estrogen receptor  positive. Tamoxifen  is a widely used antiestrogen
  since 1973 as an adjuvant therapy for treatment of early stage, estrogen-sensitive
  breast cancer  and as a chemopreventive agent in high risk women. However, TAM is
  reported to increase the patients risk of developing endometrial cancer  due to
  genotoxic DNA damage. TAM-DNA adduct formation has been observed in leukocytes  and
  endometrial samples of breast cancer patients. In addition, growth of some tumours
  may initially be attenuated by TAM but become resistant to continued treatment and
  continue to grow. According to the report of Early Breast Cancer Triallists Collaborative
  Group, one-third of breast cancer patients treated with TAM for 5 years will have
  recurrent disease within 15 years.\n\nThe drawbacks of current chemotherapeutic
  drugs have further promoted the search for alternative drugs or adjuvants that confer
  maximum effect and are less harmful for cancer treatment. Natural products serve
  as an important source of therapeutic agents as they may contain potential lead
  compounds that are suitable for drug development. Compounds isolated from plants
  that have their long-term history of human use are likely to be safer than those
  with no prior history. Examples of natural product-based drugs used as a chemotherapy
  for breast cancer include the microbe-derived anthracycline doxorubicin isolated
  from Streptomyces peucetius  and the plant-derived microtubule stabilizing agent,
  paclitaxel, which was isolated from the bark of the Pacific yew tree, Taxus brevifolia.
  Unfortunately, cellular resistance also develops with the use of anthracyclines
  and taxanes. We have previously demonstrated the potential of the Malaysian Tualang
  honey  as an anticancer agent against breast and cervical cancer cells in vitro.
  TH was found to cause depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane and induce caspase-dependent
  apoptosis of these cells. In this paper we demonstrate the potential of TH in modulating
  the anticancer activities of TAM in ER -dependent MCF-7 and ER -independent MDA-MB-231
  breast cancer cell lines and to further understand the mechanism of the cell death
  involved. \n\nAll media and supplements for cell culture were purchased from Gibco,
  Invitrogen. Tamoxifen citrate was purchased from Sigma. 5,6,6-tetrachloro-1,1,3,3tetraethylbenzimidazolyl-carbocyanine
  iodide  dye was obtained from Invitrogen. Annexin V Fluorescence kit was purchased
  from Roche. Fluorochrome Inhibitor of caspases  Apoptosis Detection kits for caspase-3/7,
  caspase-8, and caspase-9  were purchased from ImmunoChemistry Technologies, LLC.
  Human breast adenocarcinoma cell lines, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231, were obtained from
  the American Type Culture Collection.\n\nMCF-7 &amp; MDA-MB-231 cells were propagated
  in Dulbeccos modified Eagles medium  supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and
  1 unit/mL penicillin/streptomycin. The cell lines were maintained at 37C in 5% CO2
  humidified atmosphere. For analysis, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded in appropriate
  culture vessels at a density of  cells/mL and allowed to adhere overnight. The medium
  was then replaced with fresh assay medium supplemented with 2 % fetal bovine serum
  containing TH, TAM, or their combination.\n\nTH  which was collected from the hives
  of the Asian giant bee  on the Tualang tree  in the Malaysian jungle was supplied
  by the Federal Agricultural Marketing Authority, Malaysia. TH was initially dissolved
  in serum-free culture medium at a concentration of 10%  and filter sterilized using
  0.22 m syringe filter unit. The honey mixture was freshly prepared before being
  added to cell cultures. \n\nCells cultured in 25 cm2 flasks were treated with 1%
  TH or in combination with TAM at various concentrations  or TAM alone. Cells were
  harvested at 6, 24, 48, and 72 h after treatment by trypsinization, washed with
  phosphate buffered saline, and incubated with annexin V fluorescent antibody and
  propidium iodide  for 15 min at room temperature. A minimum of 10,000 events were
  collected and analyzed using flow cytometry. \n\nFor evaluation of m, cells were
  cultured in 6-well plates in fresh assay medium containing TH, TAM, or TH + TAM
  for 24 h. Cells were then trypsinized, washed with PBS, and incubated with JC-1
  dye at a final concentration of 10 g/mL for 15-20 min. The cells were then washed
  with PBS, centrifuged to remove the supernatant, and resuspended with fresh medium
  for flow cytometric analysis. JC-1 dye accumulates within intact mitochondria to
  form multimer J-aggregates  while the colour of the dye changes from red to green
  in response to reduction in the mitochondrial membrane potential. The percentage
  of green fluorescence from JC-1 monomers was measured as mitochondrial depolarized
  \ cells. \n\nCells cultured in 2-well multichamber slides were treated with TH,
  TAM, or TH + TAM for 6 h. After treatment, the culture medium was discarded, and
  the cells were washed with PBS followed by incubation with 10 L of either caspase-3/7
  FLICA, caspase-8 FLICA, or caspase-9 FLICA for 1 h in 300 L of fresh culture medium.
  The green fluorescent labeled FLICA probe binds covalently to the reactive cysteine
  residue on the large subunit of active caspase. Cells were also counterstained with
  Hoechst  dye. The fluorescence images were then analysed using the fluorescence
  microscope.\n\nData were obtained from at least three independent experiments. The
  values were expressed as mean  standard deviation. Statistical evaluations were
  performed using Mann-Whitney U test, and  was considered significant.\n\nFlow cytometric
  analyses of cells stained with annexin V fluorescent antibody and PI showed that
  TH significantly increased the percentage of apoptotic cells in both the ER -positive
  and ER -negative breast cancer cells in a time-dependent manner compared to the
  untreated cells  and 1). Interestingly, the combination of TH and TAM significantly
  increased the percentage of apoptotic cells compared to single treatments. In MCF-7
  cells, the combination of TH with the lowest concentration of TAM  showed significantly
  higher induction of total apoptosis  compared to TAM alone  after 24 h posttreatment
  ). However, the percentages of apoptosis obtained were not significantly different
  from the MCF-7 cells treated with TH alone. Similarly, the combined TH and 15 M
  TAM resulted in significant increase in apoptotic cell death at 24 h  and 48 h.
  The effect of the combination treatments is more prominent in the ER -negative cells
  with more pronounced increases in apoptotic cell death observed with all four combinations
  compared to TH or TAM treatment alone ). The increase is mainly attributed to the
  promotion of late-stage apoptosis in both ER -positive and ER -negative cells compared
  to cells treated with TH or TAM alone  and 2). \n\nFigure 1: Total apoptosis induced

  using annexin-V-Fluos antibody and propidium iodide. Data are expressed as mean

  from TH alone.  significantly different from TAM alone.\n\nTo explore the cell death
  mechanism involved, changes in the m were first analysed. Figure 3 shows high levels
  of green fluorescence staining following treatments with TH alone and in combination
  with 5 M TAM indicating strong depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane of MCF-7
  cells with significant difference to TAM treatment alone ). Similarly, TH and TH
  + TAM produced more reduction in m in MDA-MB-231 cells compared to TAM alone  and
  4). \n\nFigure 3: Effect of TH, TAM, and TH + TAM on the mitochondrial membrane
  potential of MCF-7 cells. Cells treated with TH alone or in combination with TH
  \ for 24 h were stained with mitochondrial-selective JC-1 dye and analyzed by flow
  cytometry.  The dot plots represent the population of mitochondrial membrane-depolarized
  cells on the lower right  and mitochondrial membrane-polarized cells on the upper
  right.  Bar graphs represent the percentages of polarized and depolarized cells.

  cells on the lower right  and mitochondrial membrane-polarized cells on the upper

  \ significantly different from untreated control.\n\nActivation of caspase-3/7,
  -8, and -9 was then determined, in both cells. Results indicate that TAM strongly
  activated caspase-7 but caused no or very minimal activation of caspase-8 and-9
  in ER -positive MCF-7 cells. Activation of all three caspases was induced by TAM
  in ER -negative MDA-MB-231 cells. We have previously reported that TH activated
  caspase-3/7 and -9 in these cells. In the current study, significant activation
  of these caspases as well as caspase-8 was observed in both ER -positive and ER
  -negative cells. The combination of TH and TAM produced effects similar to those
  observed with TH alone in both types of cells. \n\nFigure 5: Effect of TH, TAM,
  and TH + TAM on caspase activation in MCF-7 cells. Treated  and untreated cells
  were stained for caspase-3/7 FLICA, caspase-8 FLICA, and caspase-9 FLICA  which
  is indicated by green fluorescence. Cell nuclei are stained blue.\n\nFigure 6: Effect
  of TH, TAM, and TH + TAM on caspase activation in MDA-MB-231 cells. Treated  and
  untreated cells were stained for caspase-3/7 FLICA, caspase-8 FLICA, and caspase-9
  FLICA  which is indicated by green fluorescence. Cell nuclei are stained blue.\n\nAntiproliferative
  effect of methanolic extracts of the Malaysian TH has been demonstrated on keloid
  fibroblasts, which has been suggested to be due to the presence of fatty acids such
  as palmitic acid, oleic acid, and linoleic acid. Other studies have also indicated
  that TH has high antioxidant capacity and free radical scavenging activity due to
  its high content of phenolic compounds, flavonoids, and ascorbic acids. We have
  previously shown that TH induced apoptosis of MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, and HeLa cells
  via a caspase-dependent pathway involving depolarization of the m. We further show
  in this paper that TH is more potent in inducing mitochondrial membrane depolarization
  than TAM. Apoptosis is an important mode of action of many anticancer agents including
  TAM. The antiestrogenic effects of TAM are thought to be responsible for its anticancer
  activities. This is accomplished via competitive inhibition of estrogen binding
  to ER, resulting in cellular apoptosis. However, the dosage of TAM needed to induce
  cytotoxicity and growth inhibition would depend on the types of cells studied. Petinari
  et al.  showed that various IC50 values  of TAM were obtained from different cell
  lines. Low concentrations of TAM  would result in only growth arrest, but induction
  of cell death would be observed at high concentrations. In this present study, different
  doses of TAM starting from 2.5 M to 15 M were tested, and apoptotic cell death induced
  by TAM was found to be concentration dependent in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells.
  \n\nThe problem of drug resistance, low efficacy, and adverse effects of chemotherapeutic
  agents such as TAM has necessitated studies into the effectiveness of drug combinations
  with the hope of producing more beneficial therapeutic outcomes and overcoming the
  associated problems of single drug treatments. As such, TAM or its active metabolite,
  4-hydroxy TAM, has been studied in combination with other drugs such as trastuzumab,
  mTOR inhibitor RAD001, troglitazone, nelfinavir, and IGF1R antagonists. Studies
  by Yu et al.  demonstrated that the combination of troglitazone with TAM led to
  higher induction of growth inhibition in MCF-7 cells compared to either troglitazone
  or TAM alone. The combination of IGF1R antagonists with TAM also induced high levels
  of apoptosis in BT474 and MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines. Nelfinavir, an HIV protease
  inhibitor, displayed antitumoral effects on breast cancer cells which were also
  enhanced by combined treatment with TAM. There is evidence that the combination
  of natural products with chemotherapeutic agents results in additive or synergistic
  effects on cancer cells. Wang et al.  reported on the synergistic effect of gambogic
  acid  and 5-fluororacil in inhibiting proliferation and inducing apoptosis of the
  gastric carcinoma cell line, BGC-823. Recently, the synergistic activity of a Chinese
  herbal product, Celastrol, with trastuzumab or lapatinib in inhibiting the growth
  of Erb2-overexpressing human breast cancer cells in a mouse xenograft model was
  reported. \n\nIn the current study, we observed that combination treatments of TH
  and TAM at concentrations of 2.5 M-10 M conferred a good apoptotic effect with minimal
  necrosis. Potentiation of the anticancer effects of TAM by TH was observed in both
  ER -positive MCF-7 cells and ER -negative MDA-MB-231 cells which were reflected
  mainly by the increase in total and late-stage cellular apoptosis. Similarly, a
  previous study demonstrated that the combination of TAM and green tea extract produced
  a synergistic inhibition of cellular proliferation of ER-positive breast cancer
  cells including MCF-7. Green tea was proven to inhibit breast cancer growth by direct
  antiproliferative effect on the tumor cells as well as by indirect suppressive effects
  on the tumor-associated endothelial cells. \n\nReduction of m is identified as an
  early event in the apoptosis pathway. Proapoptotic proteins from the mitochondrial
  intermembrane space are released following the opening of the permeability transition
  pore leading to apoptotic cell death. Induction of mitochondrial membrane permeabilization
  by therapeutic drugs can restore apoptosis in cancer cells. Lobaton and collegues
  \ reported that 10 M TAM inhibited mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake in HeLa cells without
  significant changes in the m. In contrast, our findings showed that treatment of
  5 M TAM alone or in combination with TH in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 caused a significant
  reduction in the m compared to untreated cells. As previously reported, TH itself
  potently depolarized the mitochondrial membrane. This is in agreement with the reported
  loss of mitochondrial membrane potential following treatment of colon cancer cells
  with an Indian honey. Although mitochondrial membrane depolarization was higher
  with TH + TAM compared to the effect of the antiestrogen alone, this seems to be
  attributed to the potent effect of TH itself. \n\nProteins released following mitochondrial
  membrane depolarization include cytochrome c which subsequently activates caspases
  leading to rapid loss of mitochondrial functions in apototic cell death, but cell
  death can also occur independent of caspases. We further found that TH activated
  initiator caspases-8 and -9 with subsequent activation of executioner caspase-3
  or -7 in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. The results therefore indicate the involvement
  of both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways of apoptosis. This mechanism also holds
  true for the combination effect of TH with TAM. In the instrinsic  apoptotic pathway,
  cytosolic cytochrome c will bind with procaspase-9 and Apaf-1 to form a complex
  known as apoptosome, which triggers the cleavage of procaspase-9 to an active caspase-9,
  the initiator caspase in mitochondrial apoptosis. Caspase-8 is activated via the
  extrinsic pathway, and it causes truncation of the proapoptotic protein, BID, to
  form tBID which induces mitochondrial membrane permeabilization, allowing the release
  of cytochrome c. Activation of caspase-9 or caspase-8 results in activation of downstream
  executioner caspases, such as caspase-3. Recently, the effect of TAM on another
  ER-positive breast cancer cells, T47D, was found to be potentiated by the presence
  of a substituted quinoline which acts as a gap junctional activator. The authors
  demonstrated that the combination treatment increased the number of apoptotic cells,
  BAX expression, DNA fragmentation, and caspase-3 activation compared with individual
  treatments.\n\nTo our knowledge, this is the first study that provides evidence
  of modulation of TAM activity by honey and that the combination of TH and TAM is
  more potent than either agent alone in inhibiting cell growth of both ER -positive
  and ER -negative breast cancer cells via direct induction of caspase-dependent apoptosis.
  Potentiation of TAM effect by TH may reduce the required effective dose of TAM with
  a resultant reduction in adverse effects of TAM. This would be an interesting research
  to further support the medicinal value of honey. The current findings offer a new
  approach in designing future preclinical and human trials againts breast cancer.\n\nThis
