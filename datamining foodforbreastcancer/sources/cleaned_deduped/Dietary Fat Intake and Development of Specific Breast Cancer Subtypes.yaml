  Fat Intake and Development of Specific Breast Cancer Subtypes.md
text: '


  We prospectively evaluated fat intake as predictor of developing breast cancer  subtypes
  defined by estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and human epidermal growth
  factor 2 receptor, in a large  heterogeneous cohort of women, with 10062 BC case
  patients after 11.5 years, estimating BC hazard ratios  by Cox proportional hazard
  modeling. High total and saturated fat were associated with greater risk of ER+PR+
  disease  but not ERPR disease. High saturated fat was statistically significantly
  associated with greater risk of HER2 disease. High saturated fat intake particularly
  increases risk of receptor-positive disease, suggesting saturated fat involvement
  in the etiology of this BC subtype. '
