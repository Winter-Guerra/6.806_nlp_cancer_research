  of growth inhibition and epigenetic modulation by combination of green tea polyphenol
  and 5-aza-2-deoxycyti.md
text: "\n\nEpigenetic therapy by DNA demethylating agent 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine  is
  clinically effective in acute myeloid leukemia; however, it has shown limited results
  in treatment of breast cancer and has significant toxicity to normal cells. Green
  tea polyphenol -epigallocatechin-3-gallate  has anti-cancer and DNA demethylating
  properties with no significant toxicity toward normal cells. Therefore, the objective
  of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of a combination of non-toxic,
  low dose of 5-aza 2 dC with EGCG, on growth inhibition of breast cancer cells. Human
  breast cancer cell lines  and non-tumorigenic MCF-10A breast epithelial cells were
  treated with either 5-aza 2 dC, EGCG, or their combination for 7 days. Cell growth
  inhibition was determined by cell count, cell viability, cell cycle, and soft agar
  assay, whereas genes expression changes were determined by quantitative real-time
  PCR and/or Western blot analysis. Histone modifications and global DNA methylation
  changes were determined by Western blot and RAPD-PCR, respectively. The results
  revealed significantly greater inhibition of growth of breast cancer cells by co-treatment
  with 5-aza 2 dC and EGCG compared to individual treatments, whereas it has no significant
  toxicity to MCF-10A cells. This was further confirmed by gene expression analysis.
  Changes in DNA methylation and histone modifications were also greater in cells
  with combination treatment. Findings of this study suggest that potentiation of
  growth inhibition of breast cancer cells by 5-aza 2 dC and EGCG combination treatment,
  at least in part, is mediated by epigenetic mechanism.\n\nBreast cancer is the second
  most commonly diagnosed cancer among women in the United States. Although tremendous
  progress has been made in breast cancer treatment, it is often hindered by de novo
  or acquired drug resistance. Current chemotherapeutic drugs used in breast cancer
  mainly encompass anthracyclines, taxanes, and platinum-based drugs. However, in
  addition to cancerous cells, these drugs can also kill normal cells and have adverse
  side effects like cardio-toxicity, neutropenia, neurotoxicity, muscle fatigue, and
  abnormal blood clotting. The inadequate clinical response and toxicity of anti-cancer
  drugs to normal cells  suggest a need for alternate targets and treatment strategies
  for breast cancer.\n\nAccumulating evidence suggests that in addition to the genetic
  alterations, the epigenetic changes play an important role in breast cancer development.
  Global DNA methylation, concurrent with loci-specific hypermethylation is a common
  hallmark of breast cancer. Global hypomethylation is linked to chromosomal instability
  and activation of oncogenes, whereas loci-specific hypermethylation leads to transcriptional
  silencing of tumor suppressor genes. For example, genes involved in pathways including
  cell cycle regulation, DNA repair, growth inhibitory signaling, cell adhesion, angiogenesis,
  carcinogen detoxification, hormone regulation, and apoptosis  are silenced by promoter
  hypermethylation in breast cancer. In contrast to genetic changes like mutations
  that are non-reversible, epigenetic changes can be reversed and therefore epigenetically
  silenced genes in cancer can be reactivated. It is because of this reversible nature
  of epigenetic alterations in target molecules, a new strategy known as epigenetic
  therapy has recently emerged for cancer therapy. Epigenetic alterations can also
  serve as biomarkers of cancer risk. A recent study has associated methylation of
  ATM gene in white blood cells with breast cancer risk.\n\nDecitabine or 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine
  \ is a nucleoside analog and well-established DNA demethylating agent. Evidence
  suggests that 5-aza 2dC demethylates DNA by various mechanisms, such as inhibiting
  the activity of DNA methyltransferase enzyme  and degradation of DNA methyltransferase
  1  by ubiquitination-dependent proteasomal pathway. Pharmacological action of 5-aza
  2 dC is mediated by its incorporation into DNA, leading to formation of irresolvable
  DNA-5-aza 2 dC complex. Interestingly, 5-aza 2 dC acts as demethylating agent only
  at low doses, and higher doses of this drug cause cell death due to cytotoxicity.
  Doses of 5-aza 2 dC that are currently used in the clinic have shown limited results
  in solid tumors when given as a single agent, and higher doses cause cytotoxicity
  to normal cells. To overcome this limitation of 5aza-2dC for its clinical use as
  a chemotherapeutic agent, it has been suggested that combination of epigenetic modifiers
  may be more successful in DNA demethylation-mediated re-expression of silenced genes
  in breast cancer.\n\n-epigallocatechin-3-gallate  is the major catechin among the
  polyphenols in green tea. Evidence suggests that EGCG can inhibit the growth of
  breast cancer cells in vitro and breast tumor in vivo. It has been reported that
  EGCG can induce cancer cell-specific apoptosis and cell cycle arrest and has no
  or minimal toxicity toward normal cells. Mechanistically, EGCG inhibits breast cancer
  growth by interfering with multiple signaling pathways including NF-B, MAPK, and
  EGFR. Additionally, EGCG is an epigenetic modifier, which can re-express epigenetically
  silenced tumor suppressor genes such as RAR, hMLH1, GSTP1, and p16 INK4a by downregulation
  of DNA methyltransferase and histone deacetylase activity in cancer cells. Treatment
  of human prostate cancer LNCaP cells with green tea polyphenols causes time-dependent
  inhibition of HDACs 1, 2, and 3 expressions and upregulation of histone acetylation.
  As EGCG selectively kills cancer cells and has shown great promise in growth inhibition
  of cancer cells, it presents a high potential for development as an effective and
  minimally cytotoxic cancer therapeutic. However, the concentrations of EGCG used
  in vitro studies for growth inhibition are unachievable through daily intake of
  tea in patients, thus limiting its potential as a monotherapeutic agent in cancer.\n\nWhile
  chemotherapeutic or epigenetic drugs have been used in combination with EGCG or
  5-aza 2 dC so as to synergize tumor suppression or sensitize cancer cells, the potential
  of combination treatment of 5-aza 2 dC and EGCG on growth inhibition of breast cancer
  cells is not known. Both compounds are established DNA methyltransferase inhibitors,
  therefore their combination may have greater effect on re-expression of genes that
  are silenced by promoter hypermethylation in breast cancer. In addition to the tumor
  growth suppression by restoration of epigenetically silenced tumor suppressor genes,
  EGCG-mediated cell cycle arrest and apoptosis through targeting cell signaling pathways
  can further add to inhibition of breast cancer growth. This suggests that extended
  co-treatment with non-toxic, low doses of 5-aza 2 dC and EGCG may potentiate growth
  inhibition of breast cancer through synergistically reactivating tumor suppressors
  as well as drug-specific mechanisms, while minimizing cytotoxicity to normal cells.
  Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of 5-aza 2 dC
  and EGCG co-treatment, at low concentrations as compared to their individual treatment
  on growth inhibition of breast cancer cells in vitro.\n\n5-Aza-2-deoxycytidine,
  -epigallocatechin-3-gallate, and dimethyl sulfoxide  were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
  TRizol for RNA isolation was purchased from Invitrogen, Inc..\n\nHuman breast cancer
  cell lines MCF-7  and MDA-MB 231  as well as the human normal breast epithelial
  cell line MCF 10A were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. MCF 10A is
  a non-tumorigenic human breast epithelial cell line and has been a widely accepted
  model for normal breast epithelium. MCF 10A cells were maintained in MEBM mammary
  epithelial cell growth media. MCF-7 and MDA-MB 231 cells were propagated in Dulbeccos
  modified eagle minimal medium  supplemented with 5 % fetal bovine serum  and 1 %
  antibioticantimycotic solution. Cell culture of all the three cell lines were maintained
  at 37 C in a 5 % CO2-containing humidified incubator. Cells were treated with either
  5-aza 2 dC, EGCG, combination of EGCG and 5-aza 2 dC or DMSO  as vehicle control
  for 7 days. Stock solutions for treatment were made in DMSO and diluted prior to
  use. Treatments were given in cell culture media specific for each cell line. Media
  were changed, and fresh treatment was given after every 48 h. All the three cell
  lines were used to evaluate the effect of treatments on cell growth. Since the observed
  effects of treatment on growth were greater in MCF-7 cells than MDA-MB231, only
  MCF-7 cells were used for subsequent molecular and mechanistic analysis.\n\nCell
  count analysis was performed to assess the effects of 5-aza 2 dC, EGCG, and their
  combination on the growth inhibition of MCF10A, MCF-7, and MDA-MB 231 cells. Briefly,
  100,000 cells were seeded in 6-well plates. After 24 h of seeding, cells were treated
  with either 5-aza 2 dC, EGCG, combination of EGCG and 5-aza 2 dC or DMSO  for 7
  days. Treatments were given in cell culture media specific for each cell lines.
  Media were changed, and fresh treatment was given after every 48 h. At day 7, cells
  were detached by trypsinization and suspended in cell culture media, and viable
  cells were counted with a Nexcelom Cellometer cell counter. Each treatment was run
  in triplicates and the experiment was repeated twice.\n\nMethyl thiazolyl tetrazolium
  \ assay was performed to determine the effects of EGCG and 5-aza2dC treatments on
  cell viability. Cells were seeded in triplicates in 96-well plates at a density
  of 2,500 cells per well. After 24 h of seeding, cells were treated with 5-aza2dC,
  EGCG, and their combination as mentioned above. Media were changed, and fresh treatment
  was given after every 48 h. MTT assay was performed at day 7 of the treatment. Briefly,
  media were removed, cells were washed with 1X PBS, fresh culture media with MTT
  \ were added to each well, and the plate was incubated at 37 C for 4 h. Media were
  removed, and formazan was solubilized by adding 200 L of DMSO in each well. The
  optical density  was measured at 570 and 650 nm. Each treatment was run in triplicates
  and the experiment was repeated twice. Cell viability was converted into percentage
  with respect to control as 100 %.\n\nCells were seeded in 25-cm2 flasks and treated
  as mentioned earlier. The optimum cell seeding density was chosen so as to maintain
  sub-confluency at the time of cell fixation. After 7 days of treatment, cells were
  fixed in 70 % cold ethanol and stored at 4 C for 24 h. Fixed cells were stained
  with Guava Cell Cycle Reagent, and cell cycle analysis was performed using Guava
  EasyCyteTM flow cytometer  as per manufacturers instructions. A total of 5,000 gated
  events were counted and data were acquired for each sample by Guava Incyte software.
  Each treatment was run in triplicates and the experiment was repeated twice.\n\nAnchorage-independent
  growth of MCF-7 cells was determined by soft agar assay. Briefly, a base layer of
  agar  in cell culture media was plated in six-well plates. MCF-7 cells were treated
  as mentioned earlier for 72 h, mixed in top layer agar solution  and then plated
  at a density of 5,000 cells per well. Each treatment group was plated in triplicates.
  Plates were incubated at 37 C in a 5 % CO2-containing humidified incubator. After
  plating, cells were treated with different drug regimes as mentioned previously
  after every 48 h. After 7 days of colony growth, cells were stained with 0.001 %
  crystal violet dye, and colonies were visualized and counted under a microscope.\n\nTotal
  RNA was isolated from control and treated MCF-7 cells by TRIzol method and one-step
  real-time PCR kit with SYBR green dye  was used for amplification of total RNA  as
  per manufacturers instructions. Quantitative real-time PCR  amplifications were
  performed in 96-well reaction plates using MyiQ2 real-time PCR detection system
  \ with the following PCR amplification conditions: Reverse transcription at 50 C
  for 10 min, RT enzyme inactivation at 95 C for 5 min, followed by 40 cycles each
  of 10 s denaturation at 95 C and 30 s annealing and extension at 60 C. Specificity
  of the PCR products was verified by melt curve analysis. Threshold cycle number
  \ was determined using iCycler IQ2 optical system software. The Ct value of each
  gene of interest was normalized to Ct value of GAPDH, and fold change in the gene
  expression was calculated using the deltadelta Ct method. Amplification reaction
  for each treatment was performed in triplicates, and the experiment was repeated
  twice. A non-template control was included in each experiment. Primer sequences
  used for qRT-PCR are given in Table 1.\n\nSequences of forward and reverse primers
  used in analysis of gene expression by real-time PCR  \n\nMethylation-sensitive
  random amplification of polymorphic DNA was carried out to study the effect of treatment
  on DNA methylation patterns. MS-RAPD is based on digestion of DNA by isoschizomeric
  restriction enzymes, methylation sensitive  and methylation insensitive. Both the
  enzymes recognize CCGG; however, Hpa II is unable to cut when internal cytosine
  residue is methylated, whereas MspI can cleave with internal cytosine methylated,
  and therefore can discriminate between methylated and unmethylated cytosine.\n\nTotal
  DNA was extracted from treated and control MCF-7 cells by SDS/proteinase K digestion
  and phenolchloroform extraction method as described before. DNA was quantified spectrophotometrically,
  and quality was verified by agarose gel electrophoresis. 2.5 g of DNA was used for
  single digestion with HpaII and MspI at 37 C overnight. RAPD-PCR was performed using
  digested and undigested DNA with random 10-mer primers. Reaction was carried out
  in a 25-L reaction mixture containing 100 M dNTPs, 100 nM primer, 0.5 U AmpliTaq
  DNA polymerase, 2.5 L enzyme assay buffer, 2.5 mM MgCl2, and 75 ng DNA. The PCR
  amplifications were performed in a DNA thermal cycler  programmed for 45 cycles
  as follows: one cycle of 3.5 min at 92 C, 1 min at 34 C, and 2 min at 72 C followed
  by 44 cycles of 1 min at 92 C, 1 min at 34 C and 2 min at 72 C, followed by a final
  extension cycle of 15 min at 72 C. PCR products were resolved on 1.5 % agarose gel
  and visualized by ethidium bromide staining.\n\nProtein lysates were prepared from
  7-day treated and control MCF-7 cells and resolved by SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis.
  After electrophoretic separation, the protein bands were transferred to a nitrocellulose
  membrane. The membrane was blocked with 5 % non-fat milk solution  for an hour at
  room temperature and then incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4 C. Dilutions
  of antibodies used are as follows: GAPDH 1:200, DNMT1 1:100, H3K27me3 1:200, MBD4
  1:100, HDAC1 1:100, p-Ac-H3  1:200. After incubation, membranes were given three
  washes, each of 10 min with 1X TBST washing buffer  and then incubated with appropriate
  horseradish peroxidase conjugated secondary antibodies at 1:1,000, 1:500  dilutions
  for an hour at room temperature. Membranes were washed three times, each for 10
  min with 1X TBST buffer. Protein bands were visualized with chemiluminescence detection
  system. Band intensity was quantified with ImageJ software. Intensity value for
  protein of interest was normalized to GAPDH and plotted as histogram.\n\nStudents
  t test  was performed to determine the significant difference between treatments.
  Values with p ; 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.\n\nTo determine
  the effect of 5-aza 2 dC, EGCG, and their co-treatment on breast cancer cell growth
  in vitro, cell count analysis and MTT assay were performed after treating cells
  for 7 days. The results of cell count analysis and MTT assay are given in Fig. 1.
  Treatment with 5-aza 2 dC alone resulted in statistically significant  growth inhibition
  of both MCF-7 and MDA-MB231 cells by 22.7 and 23.4 percent, respectively, as compared
  to vehicle-treated control cells. Treatment with EGCG alone significantly inhibited
  the growth of MCF-7 cells by 23.5 percent, whereas growth inhibition of MDA-MB 231
  cells by 18.5 % was statistically not significant. The combination of 5-aza 2 dC
  and EGCG, however, significantly inhibited the growth of both MCF-7 and MDA-MB 231
  cells by 46.5 and 39.5 percent, respectively, thereby suggesting a synergistic effect
  of co-treatment on growth inhibition of these breast cancer cells. There was no
  significant growth inhibition of MCF-10A cells after treatment with 5-aza 2 dC and
  EGCG both alone and in combination.\n\nBar graph representation of the effect of
  5-aza 2 dC, EGCG, and their combination treatments on growth inhibition of MCF-10A,
  MCF-7, and MDA-MB 231 cells as measured by cell count analysis  and cell viability
  by MTT assay. Cells were treated with 5-aza 2 dC, EGCG, 5-aza 2 dC, and EGCG combination
  or vehicle  control for 7 days, and cell count analysis and MTT assay were performed
  as described in Materials and Methods. Average value of cell counts and MTT assay
  from each treatment group was converted into percentage with vehicle control as
  100 % and bar graph was plotted. An asterisk indicates statistically significant
  difference as compared to vehicle control. Symbol hash indicates significant difference
  as compared to corresponding concentration of 5-aza 2 dC. Symbol infinity indicates
  significant difference as compared to corresponding concentration of EGCG\n\nTo
  further validate the result of cell count, MTT assay for cell viability was also
  performed. The result of MTT assay revealed that treatment of MCF-7 cells with 5-aza
  2 dC and EGCG alone for 7 days caused significant decrease in their viability by
  23.57 and 27.08 %, respectively, as compared to the vehicle-treated control cells.
  The combination of 5-aza 2 dC and EGCG, however, resulted in greater decrease in
  MCF-7 cell viability by 45.12 % as compared to cells treated with either 5-aza 2
  dC or EGCG alone. Similarly, treatment with 5-aza 2 dC and EGCG both alone resulted
  in 42.01 and 37.26 % decrease in viability of MDA-MB 231 cells, whereas their combination
  resulted in even greater decrease by 51.4 % in this cell line. Decreases in viability
  of MCF-7 and MDA-MB231 cells treated with 5-aza 2 dC and EGCG combination were statistically
  significant as compared to both vehicle-treated control cells and cells treated
  individually with either of these two compounds. There was no significant change
  in the viability of MCF-10A cells treated with either 5-aza 2 dC or EGCG alone as
  well as their combination. Therefore, the MTT data further confirmed the potentiation
  of growth inhibition in these two breast cancer cell lines by combination of 5-aza
  2 dC and EGCG as compared to cells treated alone with either of these two compounds.\n\nCell
  cycle analysis was performed to determine whether EGCG and 5-aza 2 dC decrease the
  growth of MCF-7 and MDA-MB 231 cells by induction of apoptosis and/or delayed cell
  cycle progression. The flow cytometry histograms are given in Fig. 2a, and the percentage
  of cells in pre-G1 is given as bar graph in Fig. 2b. As compared to vehicle control,
  an increase in pre-G1 sub-population  was observed in all the treated groups of
  both MCF-7 and MDA-MB 231 cells. Interestingly, the percentage of pre-G1 cell population
  was significantly higher in cells treated with the combination of EGCG and 5-aza
  2 dC than cells treated individually with either EGCG or 5-aza 2 dC. For example,
  treatment of MCF-7 cells with 5-aza 2 dC and EGCG alone resulted in 15.8 and 21.2
  percent cells, respectively, in pre-G1, whereas cells co-treated with 5-aza 2 dC
  and EGCG had 30.5 percent cells in pre-G1. Similarly, MDA-MB 231 cells treated with
  5-aza 2 dC and EGCG alone had 7.3 and 16.9 percent cells, respectively, in pre-G1,
  whereas their combination resulted in 24.2 percent cells in pre-G1. As compared
  to MCF-7 and MDA-MB 231 cells, the percentage of pre-G1 cells in MCF-10A was extremely
  low in both 5-aza 2 dC and EGCG alone and their combination treatment groups. Treatment
  of MCF-10A cells with 5-aza 2 dC and EGCG alone resulted in 0.1 and 0.6 percent
  cells, respectively, in pre-G1, whereas cells co-treated with 5-aza 2 dC and EGCG
  had 1.5 percent cells in pre-G1. Therefore, the cell cycle data suggest that apoptosis
  may be one of the mechanisms through which co-treatment of 5-aza 2 dC and EGCG potentiates
  the growth inhibition of breast cancer cells but had no adverse effect on the growth
  of normal breast epithelial cells.\n\na Representative flow cytometry histogram

  231 cells treated with 5-aza 2 dC, EGCG, EGCG and 5-aza 2 dC combination, or vehicle
  \ control for 7 days. Cells were treated, fixed, stained, and analyzed by flow cytometry
  as described in Materials and Methods. b Bar graph of percentage of cells in pre-G1

  asterisk indicates statistically significant difference as compared to vehicle control.
  Symbol hash indicates significant difference as compared to corresponding concentration
  of 5-aza 2 dC. Symbol infinity indicates significant difference as compared to corresponding
  concentration of EGCG\n\nSoft agar colony formation assay was performed in order
  to determine the effect of 5-aza 2 dC and EGCG on the colony formation of MCF-7
  cells. The result of soft agar assay showed that both, 5-aza 2 dC and EGCG, as well
  as their combination significantly reduced the anchorage-independent growth of MCF-7
  cells. As compared to control, there was a significant reduction in the number of
  soft agar grown colonies by 47.5, 58.4, and 90.5 % in 5-aza 2 dC, EGCG, and combination
  treatment, respectively. In addition to the decreased number of colonies, decrease
  in the size of colonies was also observed in all the treatment groups as compared
  to vehicle control. The combination treatment resulted in the maximum reduction
  in number as well as in size of colonies. Thus, the data of soft agar assay suggest
  that co-treatment resulted not only in greater reduction of breast cancer cell growth
  but also anchorage-independent growth, an indicator of cell tumorigenic potential,
  of MCF-7 cells as compared to control and individual treatments.\n\nRepresentative
  photographs of soft agar grown colonies of MCF-7 cells treated with DMSO as vehicle
  control, 5-aza 2 dC, EGCG, and combination of EGCG and 5-aza 2 dC. Cells were treated
  with these chemicals for 72 h and then grown in soft agar for 7 days. Details of
  cell treatments and seeding on soft agar are discussed in materials and methods
  section. The representative images for the number and size of cell colonies formed
  in each treatment as observed under 40 and 100 magnifications are given. The histogram
  represents the average number of colonies  in each treatment group. Data are represented
  as mean  SEM. An asterisk indicates statistically significant difference as compared
  to vehicle control. Symbol hash indicates significant difference as compared to
  corresponding concentration of 5-aza 2 dC. Symbol infinity indicates significant
  difference as compared to corresponding concentration of EGCG\n\nTo further understand
  the growth inhibitory effect of 5-aza 2 dC, EGCG, and their co-treatment at molecular
  level, the expression of genes involved in cell cycle, apoptosis, tumor suppression,
  and proliferation of breast cancer cells was analyzed at transcript level by quantitative
  real-time PCR. The changes in the expression of each category of genes are as follows:\n\nThe
  representative genes for cell cycle, cell survival, and growth signaling  were analyzed.
  Among the cell cycle-related genes, the expression of CCNE2 and CCNA1 was significantly
  downregulated in all the treatment groups as compared to control. Although there
  was no significant change in the G1 cyclin CCND1 in 5-aza 2 dC-treated cells, its
  expression was significantly downregulated in EGCG-treated cells. Co-treatment of
  5-aza 2 dC and EGCG leads to significantly greater downregulation in CCND1 expression
  \ as compared to individual treatments. Similarly, co-treatment leads to significantly
  greater downregulation of another G1 cyclin, CCNE2  as compared to the treatment
  with 5-aza 2 dC  and EGCG  alone. Decreased expression of CCNA1 was also observed
  in all the treated groups, however, co-treatment did not lead to greater decrease
  as compared to individual treatments. The expression of CCNG1 was significantly
  downregulated in 5-aza 2 dC-treated cells  as well as cells co-treated with 5-aza
  2 dC and EGCG, but not in those treated with EGCG  alone. The expression of another
  negative cell cycle regulatory gene, cyclin CCNG2 was significantly upregulated
  in EGCG-treated  and co-treated cells. However, no significant difference was observed
  in the expression of CCNG2 in 5-aza 2 dC-treated cells  as compared to control.
  The expression of pro-apoptotic gene, Bax was significantly increased in all the
  treated cells as compared to control, however, the expression of Bax in co-treated
  cells  was significantly increased as compared to 5-aza 2 dC  but not EGCG. The
  expression of anti-apoptotic gene, Bcl2 was significantly downregulated in 5-aza
  2 dC and EGCG-treated cells. Co-treated cells had significantly more downregulation
  in Bcl2  as compared to cells treated with either 5-aza 2 dC  or EGCG. Maximum alteration
  of Bax: Bcl2 ratio, in favor of apoptosis  was observed in co-treated cells  as
  compared to that in cells treated with either 5-aza 2 dC and EGCG. Similar trend
  of downregulation of pro-survival genes, Survivin and Wnt1, was also observed. Significantly
  greater downregulation of Wnt1 was observed in co-treated cells  as compared to
  cells treated with either 5-aza 2 dC  or EGCG. Expression of RASSF1A gene, known
  to have tumor suppressor properties was significantly upregulated in all treatments
  as compared to control. As compared to individually treated cells, significantly
  greater upregulation of RASSF1A, was observed in co-treated cells.\n\nQuantitative
  real-time PCR analysis of gene expression in MCF-7 cells treated with 5-aza 2 dC,
  EGCG, EGCG and 5-aza 2 dC combination and DMSO as vehicle control for 7 days. One-step
  RT-PCR with total cellular RNA was performed as described in Materials and Methods.
  Fold change in gene expression was determined by deltadelta Ct method and plotted
  as mean  SEM. An asterisk indicates statistically significant difference as compared
  to vehicle control. Symbol hash indicates significant difference as compared to
  corresponding concentration of 5-aza 2 dC. Symbol infinity indicates significant
  difference as compared to corresponding concentration of EGCG\n\nTo evaluate the
  role of epigenetic mechanism on the growth inhibitory effect of 5-aza 2 dC and EGCG,
  the expression of genes involved in DNA methylation, histone deacetylation, and
  methylated DNA recognition  was analyzed by real-time PCR. The expression of the
  three DNMTs  analyzed in this study was decreased in all treatments. Cells co-treated
  with EGCG and 5-aza 2 dC had significantly greater downregulation in DNMT1 and DNMT3b
  transcripts expression as compared to that in cells treated with either 5-aza 2
  dC or EGCG. A similar trend of maximum decrease in co-treated cells was not observed
  for DNMT3a. Expression of methyl-binding domain protein MBD4 was significantly downregulated
  by both EGCG and co-treatment, though no significant difference was seen between
  the two. No significant change in MBD4 was observed in 5-aza 2 dC-treated cells.
  Although there was a decrease in expression of HDAC1 in co-treated and EGCG-treated
  cells, it was statistically not significant.\n\nQuantitative real-time PCR analysis
  of gene expression in MCF-7 cells treated with 5-aza 2 dC, EGCG, EGCG, and 5-aza
  2 dC combination and DMSO for 7 days. One-step RT-PCR with total cellular RNA was
  performed as described in Materials and Methods. Fold change in gene expression
  was determined by Ct method  and plotted as mean  SEM. An asterisk indicates statistically
  significant difference as compared to vehicle control. Symbol hash indicates significant
  difference as compared to corresponding concentration of 5-aza 2 dC. A symbol infinity
  indicates significant difference as compared to corresponding concentration of EGCG\n\nWestern
  blot analysis was performed to further confirm the changes in the expression of
  some of the epigenetic regulatory genes  at protein level. The level of histone
  H3 modifications ) was also measured at protein level. The result  revealed that
  the expression of HDAC1, DNMT1, and MBD4 was significantly downregulated in cells
  treated with either 5-aza 2 dC, EGCG, or their co-treatment. As compared to cells
  treated with either 5-aza 2 dC or EGCG, co-treated cells had significantly greater
  downregulation of HDAC1 and MBD4. Interestingly, the expression of DNMT1 was undetectable
  in 5-aza 2 dC-treated cells, and co-treatment of 5-aza 2 dC and EGCG leads to significantly
  greater downregulation of DNMT1 as compared to EGCG alone. Co-treated cells had
  significantly greater decrease in methylated H3  when compared to 5-aza 2 dC and
  vehicle control-treated cells, but not in EGCG-treated cells. The level of histone
  H3 acetylation ) was significantly decreased in co-treated cells as compared to
  vehicle control and cells treated with either 5-aza 2 dC or EGCG.\n\nRepresentative
  Western blot images  and histograms representing their relative band intensity.
  Western blot analysis with total cellular protein lysates was performed as described
  in Materials and Methods. Relative amount of respective epigenetic regulatory proteins
  or histone modifications was determined by densitometry analysis. Band intensity
  of each protein was normalized by GAPDH intensity from the same sample and then
  plotted as mean  SEM. An asterisk indicates statistically significant difference
  as compared to vehicle control. Symbol hash indicates significant difference as
  compared to corresponding concentration of 5-aza 2 dC. A symbol infinity indicates
  significant difference as compared to corresponding concentration of EGCG\n\nThe
  effect of 5-aza 2 dC and EGCG treatments on genome-wide methylation pattern was
  evaluated by methylation-sensitive RAPD-PCR. As compared to control, there was no
  change in the RAPD fingerprint generated from undigested DNA. This indicates the
  absence of mutational changes due to 5-aza 2 dC and EGCG treatment. As compared
  to undigested DNA, the methylation-sensitive  RAPD-PCR from restriction-digested
  DNA revealed several changes in RAPD fingerprint. Comparison of DNA fingerprint
  generated from MspI-digested DNA revealed the presence of 500 and 300 bp bands in
  treated cells, whereas the intensity of these two bands was faint/hardly detectable
  in vehicle control, thereby suggesting that hypomethylation was induced at these
  loci by 5-aza 2 dC and EGCG. This was further confirmed by the presence of these
  bands in control and their loss in intensity in the treated group of cells from
  Hpa II-digested RAPD fingerprint. Similar pattern of 5-aza 2 dC- and EGCG-induced
  hypomethylation was observed in RAPD fingerprint generated from additional set of
  primers.\n\nRepresentative MS-RAPD fingerprint generated using the total DNA from
  cells treated with 5-aza 2 dC, EGCG, EGCG, and 5-aza 2 dC combination and DMSO as
  vehicle control for 7 days. Total DNA was digested with MspI and Hpa II restriction
  enzymes, and MS-RAPD-PCR was performed as described in Materials and Methods. Random
  primer sequence used to generate the RAPD fingerprint is 5-AAAGCTGCGG- 3. Treatments
  are represented as follows: M Marker; 1 DMSO; 2 5-aza 2 dC ; 3 EGCG ; 4 EGCG  and
  5-aza 2 dC. Changes in methylation pattern are indicated by arrows\n\nThe major
  finding of this study is that co-treatment with non-toxic, low concentrations of
  5-aza 2 dC and EGCG is more efficient in inhibiting growth of breast cancer cells
  as compared to individual treatments. Additionally, for the first time our data
  revealed that this potentiation of growth inhibition by co-treatment is, at least
  in part, mediated by their synergistic action on epigenetic modulators in breast
  cancer cells.\n\nBoth 5-aza 2 dC and EGCG inhibit growth of cancer cells by several
  mechanisms including apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. 5-aza 2 dC induces G2/M cell
  cycle arrest and apoptosis by altering expression of cyclins and aberrantly methylated
  apoptotic genes. Similarly, EGCG can regulate the expression of cell cycle regulatory
  and apoptotic genes to decrease cancer cell growth and proliferation by inducing
  cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. EGCG has been shown to inhibit the growth of cancer
  cells by regulating the cell surface growth factor receptors, such as epidermal
  growth factor receptor, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, insulin-like
  growth factor receptor  involved in receptor tyrosine kinase -dependent signaling
  pathways for cell proliferation, survival, and angiogenesis. Another mechanism for
  EGCGmediated growth inhibition of cancer cells involve inhibition of various transcription
  factors that are frequently upregulated in cancer cells, such as STAT1, STAT3, AP-1,
  NF-kB, Sp1, and FOXO1.\n\nThese reports suggest that both EGCG and 5-azadC have
  potential to inhibit growth of cancer cells by these two agent-specific mechanisms
  as described above. However, the efficacy of 5-azadC and EGCG is limited in solid
  tumors when given as single agent. It has been suggested that these compounds can
  be combined with other chemotherapeutic drugs or HDAC inhibitors to augment their
  effects. Therefore, in this study, we further investigated the mechanisms through
  which co-treatment of 5-aza 2 dC and EGCG resulted in greater growth inhibition
  of breast cancer cells. Significantly, greater downregulation of cyclin D1, cyclin
  E2, and Bcl2 mRNA in MCF-7 cells co-treated with EGCG and 5-aza 2 dC as compared
  to those treated with either compound alone suggests that these genes are the common
  target for these two compounds. Additionally, we also observed drug-specific changes
  in the expression of certain genes, such as cyclin G1, cyclin G2, and cyclin A1,
  thereby suggesting that these genes are uniquely targeted by either 5-azadC or EGCG.
  Therefore, the observed potentiation in growth inhibition by co-treatment may be
  due to alteration of common as well as drug-specific targets, which otherwise may
  not be possible to achieve by single-agent treatment.\n\nIn addition to these above-mentioned
  genetic targets, studies have shown that both 5-aza 2 dC and EGCG are epigenetic
  modifiers and inhibit DNMTs. Additionally, EGCG has HDAC inhibitory activity. Elevated
  levels of class 1 HDAC enzymes in breast cancer tissue suggest their role in breast
  cancer development. EGCG reduces the expression of HDAC 3 not only at transcript
  level but also by targeting this protein for degradation in HCT 116 cancer cells.
  These reports suggest that both EGCG and 5-aza 2 dC can synergistically act through
  epigenetic mechanism. Consistent with this theory, many genes including RASSF1A,
  Wnt1, CCND1, CCNA1, Bax, and survivin, that were synergistically either up or downregulated
  by co-treatment in our study, are known to be regulated by epigenetic mechanisms.
  Therefore, the epigenetic effect of EGCG and 5-aza 2 dC was also examined in this
  study. Our data indicate that co-treatment of EGCG and 5-aza 2 dC can synergistically
  target several epigenetic regulatory genes. For example, significantly greater downregulation
  of DNMT1, DNMT 3b transcripts, and HDAC1 and MBD4 proteins was observed in co-treated
  cells as compared to individually treated cells. Besides the change in expression
  of epigenetic regulatory genes, co-treatment also resulted in greater effects on
  DNA methylation and histone modifications as compared to the individual treatments.
  For example, methylation-sensitive RAPD results revealed increase in DNA hypomethylation
  in co-treated MCF-7 cells. Similarly, co-treatment resulted in decrease in histone
  H3K27 trimethylation and histone H3 acetylation ). The antibody used in this study
  for histone acetylation detects both phosphorylation of serine 11 and acetylation
  at lysine 15. Phosphorylation of serine 11 facilitates acetylation of H3 and is
  associated with mitogen-activated c-fos oncogene expression in a MAP kinase-dependent
  manner. The observed decrease in p-Ac-H3  by co-treatment of EGCG and 5-aza 2 dC
  suggests that these two compounds mediate growth inhibition by p-Ac-H3 -dependent
  inactivation of oncogenes in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Given the role of these
  epigenetic regulatory proteins and histone modifications in repression of critical
  genes such as tumor suppressors and DNA repair genes in cancer, the data of this
  study suggest that the observed potentiation of growth inhibition by co-treatment
  is, at least in part, mediated by epigenetic mechanisms, such as epigenetic reactivation
  of tumor suppressors and apoptotic pathways in breast cancer cells.\n\nAn important
  aspect of this study was the dose of 5-aza 2 dC and EGCG selected for treatment.
  5-aza 2 dC has a dual dose-dependent mechanism of action. High dose of 5-aza 2 dC
  leads to formation of cytotoxic DNA adducts, whereas low dose induces gene expression
  changes that favor reduced proliferation and apoptosis. EGCG has been reported to
  induce apoptosis in several cancer cell lines without affecting the normal cells.
  The result of this study from cell count, MTT assay for cell viability, and cell
  cycle analysis further confirmed that low dose 5-aza 2 dC and EGCG alone or their
  combination has no cytotoxic effect on MCF-10A normal breast epithelial cells, whereas
  these two compounds induce significant cytotoxicity to MCF-7 and MDA-MB 231 breast
  cancer cells. While the exact mechanism for this differential action is not known,
  pro-oxidative effect of EGCG has been attributed for its cancer cell-specific apoptosis.
  Studies have shown that, in general, normal cells have a better anti-oxidant system
  as compared to cancer cells, where the anti-oxidant system integrity is compromised,
  therefore normal cells are better suited to scavenge H2O2 produced by EGCG than
  cancer cells. This may be a potential reason for the cancer cell specificity of
  EGCG for inducing apoptosis. It is interesting to note that EGCG can induce apoptosis
  or necrosis based on its dose. Lower concentrations  M of EGCG have been reported
  to favor apoptosis, whereas higher concentrations  are associated with necrosis
  in MCF-7 cells. This dose-dependent effect has been attributed to apoptosis favoring
  changes in intracellular ROS, mitochondrial membrane potential, and ATP levels,
  which are induced by lower dose of EGCG. These previous reports and the result of
  this study suggests that cancer cell-specific cytotoxicity can be achieved by a
  combination of these two compounds at concentrations low enough to be safe for normal
  cells.\n\nRecent evidence suggests that combination of chemotherapeutic or naturally
  occurring compounds has advantages over single-agent treatments. For example, combination
  of EGCG with chemotherapeutic drugs such as tamoxifen or dietary phytochemicals
  like resveratrol can synergistically inhibit proliferation of breast cancer cells.
  Similarly, 5-aza 2 dC can be combined with HDAC inhibitors to synergistically decrease
  cancer cell proliferation and growth. Due to the reversible nature of epigenetic
  targets and the minimal toxicity of bioactive dietary compounds toward normal cells
  unlike conventional chemotherapeutic drugs, combination of EGCG and 5-aza 2 dC has
  great promise for clinical applications in breast cancer treatment. Therefore, these
  previous reports and the findings of this study further highlight the importance
  of combination treatment for efficient inhibition of cancer growth.\n\nIn summary,
  our data suggest that combination of 5-azadC and EGCG is more effective in terms
  of breast cancer cell growth inhibition as compared to individual treatments. Our
  study indicates that the combination of 5-aza 2 dC with green tea polyphenol EGCG
  can target cancer growth and proliferation by multiple mechanisms including modification
  of epigenetic machinery. \n\nThe authors hereby disclose that there are no financial
