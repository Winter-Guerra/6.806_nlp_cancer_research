text: "\n\nFlavones are abundant in parsley and celery and possess unique anti-inflammatory
  properties in vitro and in animal models. However, their bioavailability and bioactivity
  depend in part on the conjugation of sugars and other functional groups to the flavone
  core. The effects of juice extraction, acidification, thermal processing, and endogenous
  enzymes on flavone glycoside profile and concentration in both parsley and celery
  were investigated. Parsley yielded 72% juice with 64% of the total flavones extracted,
  whereas celery yielded 79% juice with 56% of flavones extracted. Fresh parsley juice
  averaged 281 mg flavones/100 g and fresh celery juice, 28.5 mg/100 g. Flavones in
  steamed parsley and celery were predominantly malonyl apiosylglucoside conjugates,
  whereas those in fresh samples were primarily apiosylglucoside conjugates; this
  was apparently the result of endogenous malonyl esterases. Acidification and thermal
  processing of celery converted flavone apiosylglucosides to flavone glucosides,
  which may affect the intestinal absorption and metabolism of these compounds.\n\nFlavones
  are a class of flavonoids found in a variety of fruits and vegetables and are most
  abundant in artichoke heads, kumquats, parsley, and celery. In their native forms
  they are conjugated to sugars, simple acids, and cinnamic acids  rather than existing
  as aglycones. In vitro studies demonstrate that the flavone apigenin inhibits human
  lung, colon, breast, prostate, brain, and skin cancer cells; tongue cancer; and
  leukemia. Apigenin and luteolin also reduce monocyte adhesion to LDL in vitro, showing
  potential to prevent one of the initial stages of atherosclerosis. In addition,
  animal studies with flavones demonstrate the ability to attenuate the inflammatory
  response.\n\nThe glycosylation of flavones in food is important because intestinal
  hydrolysis of flavonoid glycosides varies according to the sugars and other functional
  groups attached to the flavone core. Similar to other flavonoids, flavone glucosides
  can be hydrolyzed by -glucosidase in the small intestine to their respective aglycones,
  which can be absorbed in the small intestine and subsequently glucuronidated and
  sulfated by the small intestine and liver before reaching systemic circulation.
  In contrast, flavonoid glycosides with disaccharide and malonyl moieties are resistant
  to intestinal -glucosidase relative to their simple glucoside counterparts, potentially
  limiting their bioavailability. Therefore, determining the native glycosides is
  potentially useful when functional foods are developed.\n\nUsing a Caco-2 model,
  apigenin and luteolin aglycones were more readily absorbed into intestinal cells
  and 10 times more of the aglycone forms were transported across the intestinal epithelium
  than apigenin 6-C-glucoside or luteolin 7-O-glucoside. Experiments with isolated
  rat small intestine showed a similar pattern for isoflavones. Nearly twice as much
  genistein and daidzein  was absorbed and transported to the basolateral side than
  their 7-O-glucoside counterparts, and the malonyl glucoside conjugates were absorbed
  in only trace amounts.\n\nA review of the literature and a screening of a variety
  of fruits and vegetables revealed that parsley and celery were particularly rich
  in flavones occurring as their apiosylglucosides. On the basis of their flavone
  concentrations and the biological activity of flavones previously cited, parsley
  and celery can potentially be used in a food-based approach to the prevention of
  chronic disease. In the current study, the objective is to determine how juice processing,
  endogenous enzymes, acidification, and thermal processing affect the stability and
  glycosylation of flavones in parsley and celery. Flavone glycosides were first identified
  and quantified in fresh and steamed parsley and celery, in pomace, and in juice
  after extraction. Flavones were then quantified in juices after acidification and
  thermal processing. These processes were optimized to produce flavone derivatives
  that may have enhanced bioavailability and efficacy.\n\nChinese celery  and Italian
  parsley  were purchased from local grocery stores in Columbus, OH. Chrysoeriol and
  luteolin 7-O-glucoside were purchased from Extrasynthese ; apigenin, luteolin, and
  citric acid monohydrate from Sigma ; and diosmetin and apigenin 7-O-glucoside from
  Chromadex. All other reagents were from Fisher Scientific.\n\nTo test for endogenous
  enzymes and possible effects on flavones, celery leaves or parsley were steamed
  prior to maceration to inactivate enzymes and compared to unheated control samples.
  All samples were prepared by first rinsing and spin-drying 5 g of fresh celery leaves
  or parsley. Steamed samples were held in a sieve over 1 L of boiling water for 10
  min to inactivate endogenous enzymes. Steamed or untreated celery leaves and parsley
  were then ground in liquid nitrogen with a mortar and pestle and incubated at 37
  or 20 C for 3 h to allow any remaining endogenous enzymes to act on flavonoids in
  the samples. Experiments were done in triplicate and samples extracted as described
  below.\n\nJuicing experiments were carried out in triplicate, and the steps for
  processing are outlined in Figure 2. Celery and parsley stalks and leaves were used
  for juice extraction with an Omega 8006 masticating juicer. To determine the effects
  of pH and heat on flavones during processing, juice was divided into two lots with
  one left at its original pH  and the other acidified to pH 4.0 with citric acid.
  Each lot was then processed at 100 C for 2 or 30 min in a boiling water bath or
  at 121 C for 30 min in a Splendid pressure cooker. To further explore the effects
  of heat and pH on flavone stability and profiles, celery juices were acidified to
  pH 3.0, 4.0, or 5.0 and heated at 121 C for 15, 30, 45, or 60 min.\n\nFigure 2.
  Processes for juicing, acidification, and thermal processing of parsley and celery.\n\nSteamed
  and untreated samples were cooled on ice after incubation, and 0.5 g of each was
  extracted. To assess the mass balance of flavones in parsley and celery during processing,
  duplicate samples were lyophilized and 0.1 g of each was extracted. Acidified celery
  juices were processed at 121 C, and 1.0 g was extracted after processing and cooling.
  All samples were extracted three times with 2.5 mL of 70%  aqueous methanol, and
  the combined supernatants were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography.\n\nFlavone
  glycosides were tentatively identified by electrospray mass spectrometry  with a
  QTOF Premier  using accurate mass and fragmentation patterns in positive and negative
  ionization modes. Source parameters included the following: capillary voltage, 2.8
  kV in negative mode and 3.2 kV in positive mode; cone, 35 V; source block, 110 C,
  collision energy, 8 V. Desolvation gas was delivered at 600 L/h and 450 C, cone
  gas at 50 L/h, and collision-induced dissociation gas at 2.5  103 mBar. Sodium formate
  was used to calibrate and leucine-enkephalin as a lockspray reference. MSE experiments
  were applied where alternating low and high collision energies were used to view
  precursors and fragments in a single run. MS/MS scans were then used to confirm
  parentdaughter relationships.\n\nAnalysis of celery, parsley, and juice samples
  was conducted by HPLC. Apigenin, luteolin, chrysoeriol, diosmetin, apigenin 7-O-glucoside,
  and apigenin 7-O-apiosylglucoside standards were used to identify compounds by UV
  spectra and retention times. Other flavone glycosides were identified by ESI-MS
  as described above. For quantification, the HPLC system included a Waters 2695 separation
  module, a 2996 photodiode array detector, a Symmetry C18 column, and Empower software.
  The mobile phase consisted of 0.1% formic acid in water  and 0.1% formic acid in
  acetonitrile, and the column was maintained at 30 C. For fresh and steamed parsley
  and celery, the following gradient method was used: 01 min, 519% B; 16.5 min, 19%
  B; 6.57 min, 1920% B; 713 min, 20% B; 1315 min, 2055% B; 1518 min, 5580% B; 1820
  min, 80100% B; 2022 min, 100% B; 2225 min, 5% B. Juice samples were separated with
  the following gradient: 01 min, 518% B; 113 min, 18% B; 1315 min, 18100% B; 1517
  min, 100% B; 1720 min, 5% B. Peak areas were measured at 338 nm for apigenin and
  at 350 nm for luteolin, diosmetin, and chrysoeriol. Because the flavone glycosides
  in this study share the same chromophore as their aglycone counterparts, concentrations
  of all flavones were determined with aglycone standard curves.\n\nStatistical analysis
  was performed with R 2.11 for Windows  using one- or two-way analysis of variance
  \ blocking for different batches of celery or parsley. Post hoc comparisons were
  done with Tukeys HSD.\n\nRepresentative HPLC chromatograms for steamed celery, fresh
  celery, and acidified, thermally processed celery juice are provided in Figure 4.
  Peaks were identified by retention time, UVvisible absorbance, mass of parent ions
  in positive and negative modes, and mass of aglycone ions after fragmentation. Chlorogenic
  and coumaroylquinic acids were detected only as negative ions, and flavone malonyl
  glucosides were detected as acetyl glucosides in negative mode due to decarboxylation.
  The compounds identified in fresh and steamed celery and parsley have been previously
  reported, but apigenin 7-O-glucoside in acidified, thermally processed juice samples
  is newly identified.\n\nFigure 4. HPLC chromatograms of celery extracts:  celery
  steamed for 10 min, macerated, and incubated for 3 h at 37 C;  celery macerated
  and incubated for 3 h at 37 C;  celery juice acidified to pH 3.0 and processed for
  60 min at 121 C.\n\nTable 1. Tentative Peak Assignments for Chromatograms of Celery

  and coumaroylquinic acids were detected only in negative mode.\n\nMalonyl glycosides
  were detected as acetyl glycosides due to decarboxylation in negative mode.\n\nTo
  evaluate the effects of endogenous enzymes on flavone conjugation, celery leaves
  and parsley were steamed for 10 min prior to incubation and compared with fresh
  celery and parsley samples. When celery leaves or parsley were steamed before incubation
  at 37 or 20 C for 3 h, significantly greater amounts of flavone glycosides were
  present as malonyl apiosylglucosides and significantly less were present as apiosylglucosides
  compared to fresh samples. Fresh celery leaves and parsley contained predominantly
  flavone apiosylglucosides, and there were no significant differences associated
  with incubation temperature. There were no significant differences in total flavone
  concentrations between any of the treatments.\n\nTable 2. Concentrations of Flavone

  yielded 72% juice  with similar amounts of apigenin and diosmetin glycosides. Whereas
  the majority of apigenin, diosmetin, and total flavones were found in the juice
  after extraction, nearly one-third of the flavones were retained in the pomace.
  Celery yielded 79% juice, and slightly more apigenin, luteolin, and chrysoeriol
  were found in the juice than in the pomace. In fresh celery and juice, apigenin
  glycosides were the most abundant, accounting for over half of all flavones.\n\nFlavone
  quantities are expressed as aglycone equivalents. Data are the mean  SD, n = 3.\n\nTable

  of pH and Heat Processing on Flavone Conjugation in Parsley and Celery Juices\n\nTo
  determine the effects of pH and thermal processing on parsley and celery juices,
  untreated juices  were compared with acidified juices  and were heated at 100 or
  121 C for 230 min. In parsley juice apigenin concentrations averaged 116140 mg/100
  g fresh weight ; diosmetin, 130158 mg/100 g FW; and total flavones 247298 mg/100
  g FW. There were no significant differences associated with pH and thermal treatments
  in parsley juice. Celery juice acidified and heated to 121 C for 30 min had higher
  apigenin concentrations than those at their native pH, and juice heated to 100 C
  for 30 min had higher luteolin concentrations than nonacidified juice heated for
  only 2 min. Flavone apiosylglucosides were most abundant in all juices, followed
  by malonyl apiosylglucosides. Parsley and celery juices acidified to pH 4.0 and
  heated at 121 C for 30 min showed 1015% conversion of apiosylglucosides to simple
  glucosides, whereas flavone 7-O-glucosides were not detected in juices left at their
  native pH and heated at 121 C.\n\nAlthough parsley juice had higher flavone concentrations
  than celery juice, celery is more palatable and more economical for juicing. To
  further explore the effects of processing conditions on the stability of flavone
  glycosides, celery juice was acidified to pH 3.0, 4.0, or 5.0 and heated at 121
  C for 1560 min. After variation between lots of celery had been taken into consideration,
  the pH 3.0 and 4.0 juices had slightly higher total flavone concentrations than
  the pH 5.0 juices. There were no significant differences associated with heating
  times.\n\nAs apigenin glycosides were the most abundant flavones in celery, they
  were used to represent the change in profiles with acidification and thermal processing.
  The conversion of apiin to apigenin 7-O-glucoside in celery juice acidified to pH
  5.0 or 4.0 increased slightly with time, averaging 15% in pH 5.0 juice and 24% in
  pH 4.0 juice after 60 min. The most striking conversion of flavone glycosides occurred
  in juice acidified to pH 3.0. The conversion to apigenin 7-O-glucoside increased
  rapidly over time, from 38% after 15 min at 121 C to 83% after 60 min. There was
  no significant conversion of apigenin glycosides to aglycones and no loss of total
  apigenin derivatives after acidification and thermal processing.\n\nFigure 5. Conversion
  of apiin to apigenin 7-O-glucoside in celery juice. Juices were processed at pH
  3.0, 4.0, or 5.0 at 121 C for 1560 min. Data are the mean  SD, n = 3.\n\nFigure

  weight.\n\nIn all of the juice samples analyzed, flavone apiosylglucosides were
  the predominant flavonoids and malonyl apiosylglucosides were minor or undetectable.
  When celery leaves or parsley was steamed, significantly greater amounts of flavone
  glycosides were present as malonyl apiosylglucosides and significantly less were
  present as apiosylglucosides compared to fresh samples. Given the rapid loss of
  malonyl groups from the compounds in fresh juices and the preservation of these
  groups after steaming, this conversion of flavone glycosides is likely due to enzymatic
  activity. Malonyl esterase activity has previously been reported in parsley, but
  no reports of similar activity in celery were found after a review of the literature
  and the BRENDA enzyme database. Demalonylation of flavone glycosides can occur after
  oven-drying or after the extraction process, as has been noted with other flavonoid
  glycosides. Heating soy products can lead to demalonlyation  or decarboxylation
  \ of isoflavone malonyl glucosides, but the parsley and celery in our experiments
  retained this functional group after steaming.\n\nWith a masticating juicer, parsley
  yielded 72% juice yield  and celery yielded 79%. The majority of individual and
  total flavones were found in parsley and celery juices after extraction. However,
  pomace had higher flavone concentrations than juice, particularly from celery. This
  is similar to the retention of flavonoids in the pomace of other fruits and vegetables
  after juicing, including artichoke hearts and apples.\n\nAcidifying parsley and
  celery juices to pH 4.0 and heating at 100 or 121 C for up to 30 min did not significantly
  affect total flavone concentrations. These results were similar to those of most
  other studies on juices. Thermal processing at 95 C for up to 1 min had little effect
  on flavonoid concentrations in orange juice, and processing at 88 C for up to 30
  min had no effect on total flavonoids in tomato juice. Heating grape juice at 95
  C for 15 min did not degrade anthocyanins. In contrast, up to 49% of isoflavones
  were lost from soybeans when they were boiled for 20 min during tempeh production.\n\nAfter
  acidifying celery juice to pH 3.0, 4.0, or 5.0 and heating at 121 C for 1560 min,
  there was no effect of processing times on total flavone concentrations in this
  study. Few studies have compared the effects of extensive thermal processing on
  flavonoids in foods. Isoflavones in soy converted from glycosides to aglycone during
  extrusion at 110150 C, but no loss of total isoflavones was observed. Others have
  tested the effects of heat and pH treatments on pure flavonoid glycosides with varied
  results. Quercetin and quercetin rutinoside standards boiled at 100 C for up to
  5 h at pH 5 and 8 showed different stabilities, and both were more stable in the
  absence of oxygen. Both compounds were more stable at pH 5, and the quercetin glycoside
  was more stable than the aglycone. Daidzein and genistein  standards both degraded
  when heated at 120 C for 20 min, but the effect varied with pH. Daidzein was more
  stable at pH 9, whereas genistein was more stable at pH 7.\n\nAlthough the concentration
  of total flavones in celery juice was generally stable after heat processing, the
  conversion of apiin to apigenin 7-O-glucoside increased rapidly at 121 C over time
  at pH 3.0, reaching 83% after 60 min. Previous investigations suggested that this
  deconjugation to a simple flavonoid glucoside may improve absorption. In human subjects,
  converting hesperetin 7-O-rhamnosylglucoside to hesperetin 7-O-glucoside in orange
  juice increased peak hesperetin plasma concentrations 4-fold. The flavonoid apiosylglucosides
  in parsley and celery are similar to the flavonoid rhamnosylglucosides in orange
  juice in that they consist of a disaccharide group attached at the same position
  on the flavonoid core. Experiments with humans fed parsley and celery containing
  flavone apiosylglucosides resulted in tmax values of 78 h, compared to ;1 h for
  those fed simple flavone glucoside. These data support the hypothesis that flavone
  apiosylglucosides are absorbed in the colon, whereas simple glucosides such as apigenin
  7-O-glucoside are absorbed in the small intestine.\n\nThe bioavailability of flavones,
  particularly abundant in parsley and celery, depends on both the dose and the conjugation
  of these compounds to sugars and other functional groups. The current study shows
  that during juice processing, a substantial portion of the flavones from parsley
  and celery are retained in the pomace. Perhaps more importantly, total flavone concentrations
  changed little, but the profile of flavone glycosides in the resulting juices was
  modified by endogenous enzymes, pH, and thermal processing. Extended thermal processing
  at low pH resulted in the conversion of apigenin apiosylglucoside to apigenin glucoside,
  potentially modulating intestinal absorption and metabolism.  \n\n"
