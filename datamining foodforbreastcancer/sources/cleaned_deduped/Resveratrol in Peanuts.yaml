  Peanuts are important dietary food source of resveratrol with potent antioxidant
  properties implicated in reducing risk of cancer, cardiovascular and Alzheimers
  disease, and delaying aging. Resveratrol is a naturally occurring stilbene phytoalexin
  phenolic compound produced in response to a variety of biotic and abiotic stresses.
  This paper is a review of trans-resveratrol and related stilbenes from peanutstheir
  chemical structures, mechanisms for their biosynthesis, and concentrations in comparison
  with other major food sources. It will also discuss trans-resveratrols absorption,
  bioavailability, and major health benefits; processes to enhance their biosynthesis
  in peanuts by biotic and abiotic stresses; process optimization for enhanced levels
  in peanuts and their potential food applications; and methods used for its extraction
  and analysis.'
