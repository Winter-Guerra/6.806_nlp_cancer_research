  Safety of Cruciferous Plants in Humans A Systematic Review.md
text: "\n\nSome cruciferous plants may serve as preventive treatments for several
  medical conditions; our objective was to systematically investigate their safety
  in humans. Four electronic databases were searched, and, of 10,831 references identified,
  50 were included. Data were extracted by two independent reviewers, whereafter the
  association between interventions and adverse events was assessed. Adverse events
  in 53 subjects were identified through clinical trials; of these, altered drug metabolism
  was rated as certainly/likely caused by cruciferous plants. Adverse events in 1247
  subjects were identified through observational studies, of which none received high
  causality ratings. Adverse events in 35 subjects were identified through case reports,
  of which allergies and warfarin resistance were rated as certainly/likely caused
  by cruciferous plants. We conclude that cruciferous plants are safe in humans, with
  the exception of allergies. Individuals treated with warfarin should consult their
  physician. Further investigation of uses of cruciferous plants in preventative medicine
  is warranted.\n\nIn the last decade, a rapid rise in the demand for natural health
  products has become evident. This prominent trend stems from increasing awareness
  of the potential for significant adverse effects caused by pharmacologic interventions,
  along with a growing interest in preventive medicine strategies. \n\nA group of
  plants that has been shown to possess strong anti-inflammatory and antioxidative
  abilities is the cruciferous plants of the Brassica genus. Brassica is a genus of
  plants in the Brassicaceae family. Vegetables of the family Brassicaceae  are generally
  referred to as cruciferous vegetables. These vegetables are widely cultivated, with
  many genera, species, and cultivars being raised for food production. The most common
  Brassica vegetables eaten by people are in a single species, including kale, collard
  greens, cabbage, Brussels sprouts, kohlrabi, broccoli, and cauliflower. Numerous
  other species in the genus are also edible such as mustard, Chinese cabbage, and
  oilseed rape.\n\nSome members of this group have received wide acclaim as potential
  natural preventers or attenuators of several health conditions such as coronary
  artery disease, gastritis, and cancer. Recent studies reveal that these therapeutic
  effects may extend to the fetus as well: an international case-control study showed
  that maternal consumption of cruciferous vegetables during pregnancy decreases the
  risk of childhood anaplastic astrocarcinomas ; a study in rats found that offspring
  of spontaneously hypertensive rats that consumed broccoli sprouts during gestation
  had lower blood pressure and reduced markers of oxidative stress and inflammation,
  compared to controls.\n\nThe impetus for this systematic review stems from work
  done in our laboratory that has shown the potential benefit of supplementing the
  diet of pregnant dams with broccoli sprouts in preventing perinatal brain injury.
  In this regard, we have established a model of chronic placental insufficiency that
  results in fetal growth restriction and damage to the white matter of the brain,
  reminiscent of periventricular leukomalacia, the anatomic hallmark of cerebral palsy.
  Supplementing the maternal diet during the last trimester of pregnancy and first
  weeks of infant nutrition prevented the white matter injury and accompanying behavioural
  deficits in the offspring. These findings suggest, for the first time, a safe and
  efficacious approach to the prevention of developmental disability and cerebral
  palsy. In order to provide the background in which to determine whether this therapy
  would be acceptable for humans, a thorough determination of the safety of the cruciferous
  species of plants in humans is necessary.\n\nResearchers now believe that the key
  to the therapeutic abilities of cruciferous plants is their high content of phase-2
  enzyme inducers such as sulforaphane, which induce the transcription of genes found
  under the control of the antioxidant response element. This causes an upregulation
  of the endogenous antioxidant glutathione, crucial to the cells ability to withstand
  oxidative stress.\n\nSeveral reviews evaluated the safety and health benefits of
  some components of cruciferous plants, such as indole-3-carbinol and isothiocyanates,
  and found them safe for humans. However, to our knowledge, a systematic review evaluating
  the safety of cruciferous plants, namely, the degree of certainty that they would
  not cause any adverse effects, has not yet been published.\n\nThe purpose of this
  paper is to systematically collect and synthesize all published reports of human
  adverse events associated with exposure to cruciferous plants. This approach of
  analyzing safety of a multi-ingredient natural product is especially important when
  considering consumption of the whole plant as a therapeutic means, as opposed to
  treatment with an isolated component or metabolite of a plant.\n\nThis systematic
  paper was undertaken in line with the relevant criteria of the PRISMA  statement.
  The following methods used in the systematic review, including identification, screening,
  eligibility criteria, inclusion, and data extraction, were agreed upon by the authors
  a priori.\n\nReferences were identified through comprehensive search strategies,
  which were developed in conjunction with a research librarian. An electronic search
  of the following four databases was performed: Medline, Embase, Pascal, and IPA,
  from inception to July 2010, irrespective of language. The following search terms
  were used: isothiocyanate, Brassica, cruciferous, glucoraphanin, sulforaphane, broccoli,
  kale, cabbage, cauliflower, collard green, Brussels sprout. MESH headings and keywords
  were searched, and truncation was used as needed. A list of the search strategies
  is available as supplemental material available online at doi: 10.1155/2012/503241.\n\nThe
  research question and eligibility criteria were developed by using PICOS. The inclusion
  criteria were any studies reporting original data, addressing safety of cruciferous
  plants, their derivatives, or their constituents, to humans. Details of the eligibility
  criteria are reported in Table 1.\n\nThe references were imported into a bibliographic
  database. Titles and abstracts of identified studies were independently screened
  by two reviewers. Full texts for potentially relevant studies were obtained and
  reviewed for inclusion based on predetermined criteria. Disagreement was resolved
  by consensus, and if necessary a third party was consulted.\n\nData was extracted
  by two independent reviewers, using standardized forms. Disagreement was resolved
  by consensus. Data relating to the patient or group, the intervention, the comparator
  group, the outcomes measured, and the study design were extracted as detailed in
  Table 1.\n\nThe degree of association between the intervention and the adverse event
  was independently assessed by the two reviewers using the Causality Algorithm used
  by Health Canada and the WHO Collaborating Centre for International Drug Monitoring.
  Categories for assessment were certainly, likely, possibly, unlikely, conditional/unclassified,
  and Unassessible/Unclassifiable. Disagreement between reviewers was resolved by
  discussion. Guidelines used to assess causality are available as supplemental material.\n\nThe
  studies were finally categorized into 3 groups:  trials,  observational studies,
  and  case reports. Studies were classified as controlled clinical trials when involving
  one or more test treatments, at least one control treatment, specified outcome measures
  for evaluating the studied intervention, and when the method for assigning patients
  to the test treatment was not a mathematical randomization technique. Randomized
  controlled trials, on the other hand, were defined as studies in which randomization
  using mathematical techniques, such as the use of a random numbers table, is employed
  to assign patients to test or control treatments. Studies were classified as single-case
  experimental design trials when the subjects served as his/her own control, rather
  than using another individual or a group.\n\nWe did not perform a meta-analysis
  as the inclusion criteria for subjects, interventions, clinical outcomes, and study
  designs were very heterogeneous; conducting a meta-analysis using these data would
  not have been appropriate.\n\nSearches resulted in a total of 10,831 references.
  After screening of titles and abstracts, the full texts of 367 articles were obtained.
  Of these, 50 articles met all inclusion criteria. Of the total included publications,
  45 were published in English, 2 were published in German, and one each was published
  in Italian, French, and Spanish.\n\nArticles were excluded for the following reasons:
  not human subjects, not evaluating adverse effects or lack thereof, intervention
  or substance exposure does not include cruciferous plants, not presenting original
  data. Thirty-seven articles discussing toxic oil syndrome  were excluded post hoc
  for reasons presented below.\n\nOf the 50 included studies, 13 were trials ), 13
  were observational studies, and 24 were case reports.\n\nFigure 1: PRISMA  flow
  diagram of study identification, inclusion, and exclusion.\n\nThirteen trials were
  included, reporting adverse events in 53/496 patients. Three of them were randomized
  controlled trials, 4 were controlled clinical trials, and 6 were single-case experimental
  design  trials. Six of the trials were classified as safety trials, meaning that
  their stated primary aim was to assess safety of interventions, whereas 7 were nonsafety
  trials which evaluated efficacy of interventions but also reported adverse events.\n\nTable
  2: Trials of cruciferous plants, their derivatives, or their constituents in humans.\n\nThe
  safety trials  included 1 RCT, 1 controlled clinical trial, and 4 SCED trials. The
  only safety RCT was a double-blinded trial in 12 healthy subjects, ages 28-57, of
  whom 9 consumed daily doses of broccoli sprout extract combined with myrosinase
  \ over a period of 7 days. Extracts contained 25 mol glucosinolate, 100 mol glucosinolate,
  or 25 mol isothiocyanate. No adverse events were reported.\n\nThe second safety
  trial was a double-blind controlled clinical trial in 76 subjects, ages 3-39\\.
  Thirty-eight subjects had a reported mustard allergy, and 38 age- and gender-matched
  controls suffered from dust-mite allergy but had no mustard allergy. Both groups
  underwent food challenges with mustard and a variety of other allergens. Of the
  38 patients, 14 had a positive mustard challenge, of which 12 had oral allergy syndrome,
  1 had more severe angioedema with bronchial asthma, and 1 had systemic anaphylaxis.
  It is important to mention that of the 38 patients, 35 were atopic.\n\nThe last
  four safety trials were all single-case experimental design trials. The first was
  a trial in 10 healthy subjects, ages 21-30, which strived to determine the effect
  of cruciferous vegetables on phenacetin and antipyrine metabolism. Subjects started
  by consuming a control diet for 13 days, after which they were placed on a diet
  containing 300 g/day of Brussels sprouts and 200 g/day of cabbage over a period
  of 7 days, and finally returned to the control diet for the last 10 days. In parallel,
  every morning the subjects were given either 900 mg of phenacetin or 1.8 mg/kg of
  antipyrine. The mean plasma concentrations of either drug were measured at different
  intervals after administration. Researchers found that the cruciferous diet enhanced
  the phenacetin metabolism in the gastrointestinal tract and/or during its first
  pass in the liver, increasing its rate of elimination. No changes in antipyrine
  metabolism were noted. It is worth noting that the US Food and Drug Administration
  ordered the withdrawal of drugs containing phenacetin in November 1983, owing to
  its carcinogenic and kidney-damaging properties ).\n\nThe second SCED trial included
  10 healthy subjects, ages 23-35, and aimed to determine the effect of cruciferous
  vegetables on acetaminophen and oxazepam metabolism. Subjects started by consuming
  a control diet for 10 days, after which they were put on a diet containing 300 g/day
  of Brussels sprouts and 200 g/day of cabbage over a period of 10 days, and finally
  returned to the control diet for the last 10 days. In parallel, every morning the
  subjects were given either 45 mg of oxazepam or 1500 mg of acetaminophen. The mean
  plasma concentrations of either drug were measured at different intervals after
  administration, and a 24 h urinary recovery of conjugates was performed. Researchers
  found that the cruciferous diet enhanced the acetaminophen metabolism and glucuronide
  conjugation; however, they mention that the decreased levels of cysteine conjugate
  in urine actually indicate reduced toxicity. No changes in oxazepam metabolism were
  noted.\n\nThe third safety SCED trial included 10 healthy subjects, ages 22-40;
  the goal of this study was to determine the effect of a diet rich in Brussels sprouts
  on warfarin metabolism. Subjects consumed their customary diets for 3 days and were
  then instructed to consume 400 g/day of Brussels sprouts for the next 18 days. Warfarin
  administration  was provided twice on days 1 and 18. Mean plasma concentrations
  of warfarin were measured at different time periods, as well as prothrombin activity,
  and clearance rates were calculated. Researchers showed that the diet had resulted
  in accelerated warfarin metabolism and decreased anticoagulation.\n\nThe last safety
  SCED trial included 6 subjects, ages 20-38, with a history of recurrent allergic
  reactions to consumption of raw cabbage. This study aimed to determine the sensitivity
  profile of such patients to other cruciferous vegetables, as well as to cooked versus
  raw cabbage. Skin prick tests were performed for a variety of allergens; later,
  food challenges were performed with cooked cabbage, and levels of cabbage-specific
  IgE were measured in patients sera. All patients were found to be atopic ; all had
  positive skin prick tests to mugwort  pollen and other aeroallergens, and 5 had
  positive skin prick tests to hazelnuts, walnuts, and peanuts. Mustard sensitivity
  \ was detected in all patients. Patients demonstrated no allergic reaction to cooked
  cabbage. All patients were found to have cabbage-specific IgE antibodies in their
  sera.\n\nThe nonsafety trials  included 2 RCTs, 4 controlled clinical trials, and
  1 single-case experimental design trial, of which only one identified adverse events.\n\nThe
  trial which reported the adverse events was a controlled clinical trial in 18 subjects,
  ages 2.5-61, who suffered from recurrent respiratory papillomatosis and underwent
  complete surgical removal. All subjects received oral indole-3-carbinol supplementation
  for a period of 9-24 months in order to examine whether the supplements reduced
  the occurrence of the papillomas. Doses were 200 mg twice a day for adults, and
  individually calculated for pediatric patients based on body weight. Adverse events
  were reported in 3 patients: 1 adult, who was receiving a higher dose  for 10 days
  according to the researchers recommendation, suffered from imbalance and tremor
  and 2 girls, 2.5 and 12 years old, who took an overdose by mistake, suffered from
  unsteadiness and nausea. The symptoms in the adult resolved after returning to original
  dose and resolved spontaneously in the girls within a few hours to a day. According
  to the authors, the supplement did not cause any other side effects or complications
  \ and was generally well tolerated. It is unclear from this paper which other medications
  these specific individuals were taking, and whether they had any other acute health
  conditions which may have contributed to the adverse events described.\n\nAll other
  non-safety trials reported no adverse events with oral consumption of broccoli sprout
  infusion/homogenate, mustard oil, cauliflower leaves powder or indole-3-carbinol
  supplements, or with topical application of broccoli sprouts extract. These studies
  included both adult and pediatric populations, whose concurrent medical conditions
  included none, nutritional deficits, recurrent respiratory papillomatosis, and acute
  myocardial infarction.\n\nThirteen observational studies were included, reporting
  adverse events related to cruciferous plants in 1,247 patients. Seven of them were
  cohort studies, 3 were case-control studies, 2 were cross-sectional studies, and
  1 was a qualitative survey.\n\nTable 3: Observational studies of adverse events
  associated with human exposure to cruciferous plants, their derivatives or their
  constituents.\n\nThree cohort studies, one case-control study, and one cross-sectional
  survey examined prevalence of allergic reactions to oilseed rape. In the first cohort,
  7/1478 subjects who were naturally exposed to oilseed rape had either a positive
  skin test, a positive radio-allergosorbent test, or nasal sensitivity in response
  to oilseed rape exposure, whereas the proportion of such allergic reactions was
  14/37 in those who were occupationally exposed to oilseed rape.\n\nIn the second
  cohort, only 147/4468 subjects with suspected oilseed allergy showed positive skin
  prick test to oilseed rape; most of the subjects in this study were allergic to
  a variety of other antigens.\n\nIn the third cohort, 12/22 village residents reported
  increased allergic symptoms during a year when oilseed rape surrounded the village,
  compared with a year when another crop surrounded the village. However, authors
  mention that the symptoms reported did not correlate with oilseed rape pollen levels
  measured. They were therefore not sure what the true cause could be.\n\nIn a case-control
  study, 37 people complained of seasonal allergic symptoms and bronchial reactivity
  in response to an unknown allergen, of whom 23 were tested. However, only 2 were
  found to be allergic to oilseed rape and only 10  were found to be atopic. The authors
  concluded that the symptoms could not be attributed to oilseed rape in most of these
  cases of seasonal allergy.\n\nIn the cross-sectional survey, 683/869 of village
  residents who were exposed to oilseed rape complained of seasonal cough, wheeze,
  and headaches. However, the authors concluded that the proportion of people who
  suffered from such symptoms was not much higher in subjects living in close proximity
  to oilseed rape in comparison to control subjects who do not; this suggests that
  the seasonal symptoms in rural areas cannot be attributed to oilseed rape allergy
  alone.\n\nYet another observational study dealing with allergic reactions was a
  cohort in 259 individuals with suspected contact allergy to foods containing allyl-isothiocyanate.
  Of 259 subjects who underwent allergy skin tests, 43 had a questionable reaction,
  of whom 15 had irritation and 3 had follicular reaction. Only two showed a true
  positive reaction, but one was lost to followup.\n\nThree studies suggested a possible
  connection between cruciferous vegetables and cancer. The first was a cohort study
  in 64,327 women in Japan, ages 40-79, which examined the possible connection between
  dietary habits and risk of ovarian cancer death, based on food-frequency questionnaires.
  Whereas no adverse events were reported with consumption of cabbage or green leafy
  vegetables, a positive association was established between moderate-high consumption
  of Chinese cabbage and ovarian cancer. The authors suggest that this might be attributed
  to the fact, that, in many cases, Chinese cabbage is eaten pickled, as pickled food
  was proven to increase the risk of cancer. The researchers did not adjust for total
  energy consumption, or for comalignancies such as breast/endometrial cancer; the
  first is important as several studies found an association between total energy
  consumption and increased risk for various types of cancer. The latter is crucial,
  as many women with a history of such comalignancies are at a higher risk of developing
  ovarian cancer than the general population.\n\nThe second suggested a connection
  between cruciferous vegetables and cancer in a case-control study from Kuwait in
  which 313 thyroid cancer patients were paired with age- and gender-matched controls;
  the studys aim was to examine the relationship between different sociodemographic,
  medical or dietary factors and thyroid cancer, based on questionnaires. Whereas
  no adverse events were associated with broccoli consumption, a nonstatistically
  significant positive association was established between moderate-high consumption
  of cauliflower or cabbage and thyroid cancer. The authors conclude that no clear
  association between consumption of cruciferous vegetables and thyroid cancer could
  be established.\n\nThe last study bringing up a possible association between cruciferous
  vegetable consumption and cancer is a case-control study which paired 246 thyroid
  cancer patients from Sweden and Norway with 440 age- and gender-matched controls.
  The goal of the study was to evaluate the relationship between certain dietary habits
  and the risk of follicular and papillary thyroid carcinomas. With regard to cruciferous
  vegetables, researchers found that for people who, at any time, resided in areas
  of Sweden where goiter and iodine deficiency were endemic until the 1960s, there
  was an increased risk for thyroid cancer with consumption of cruciferous vegetables.
  These findings were not reproduced anywhere else in Sweden or Norway. Authors suggest
  that this dual effect might be related to interactions between cruciferous vegetables
  and other food components such as iodine. They also expressed surprise, as their
  findings stood in contradiction to those of many research groups that found a protective
  effect of cruciferous vegetables against thyroid cancer.\n\nThe next observational
  study included in our paper was a cross-sectional study which aimed to determine
  the association between broccoli consumption and chronic atrophic gastritis in 438
  men, ages 39-60 years. The authors found that consumption of broccoli once or more
  weekly increased the risk for chronic atrophic gastritis, based on serological tests
  for pepsinogen I and II. However, the authors acknowledge some major drawbacks to
  their work. First, H. Pylori infection, which increases the risk for chronic atrophic
  gastritis, was not measured. Second, serologic criteria were used for diagnosis,
  meaning that the results were prone to measurement errors. Moreover, it is unclear
  whether the changes in enzyme profiles were accompanied by any clinical manifestations.\n\nThe
  last observational study reporting adverse events was a qualitative survey which
  examined the relationship between consumption of certain foods by breast-feeding
  mothers, and the appearance of colic symptoms in their babies. The survey conductors
  found a positive association between consumption of cruciferous vegetables  and
  colic symptoms: abdominal pain, irritability, and intense crying. This study exhibited
  several major limitations: first, all determinants of colic symptoms, as defined
  by the authors  can be subjected to subjective interpretation; the diagnosis of
  infantile colic, as established over 50 years ago, requires a healthy baby to exhibit
  periods of intense, unexplained fussing/crying lasting more than 3 hours a day,
  more than 3 days a week for more than 3 weeks. In the study, however, no such objective
  temporal requirements were defined; any presentation of the symptoms, regardless
  of duration, was considered to constitute colic. Furthermore, since the questionnaire
  was administered over the course of one week only, instead of the 3 weeks which
  are required for diagnosis of colic, it is doubtful whether such diagnosis can be
  made at all. Moreover, since food intake and colic symptoms were reported only for
  a week, it is hard to establish proper temporal relationships between the two.\n\nTwo
  cohort studies included in our paper identified no adverse events with exposure
  to cruciferous plants or their constituents; the first study included 12 subjects
  who ingested 5-7 mg/kg/day of indole-3-carbinol. The second study, which followed
  27,111 male smokers over a period of 12 months, attempted to discover whether intakes
  of fruits, vegetables, carotenoids, or vitamins A, E, or C could be associated with
  risk of bladder cancer in these people. The study determined that no association
  between bladder cancer risk and chronic consumption of cruciferous vegetables could
  be established.\n\nTwenty-four case reports were included in the review, reporting
  adverse events in 35 individuals. The patients ranged from 17 to 70 years of age,
  whose concurrent medical conditions included allergies, both to cruciferous plants
  and to a variety of other allergens, asthma, bronchitis, atopy, cardiovascular diseases,
  and different skin conditions. The adverse events occurred after topical, respiratory,
  or oral exposure to different cruciferous plants, their constituents, or their derivatives.
  Twenty-one case reports reported allergic or hypersensitivity reactions in 31 individuals,
  including allergic contact dermatitis/contact urticaria, contact hypersensitivity,
  aggravation of eczema, cutaneous lesions similar to pityriasis rosea, asthma, rhinoconjunctivitis,
  aggravation of cough and chest pain, local swelling and itching, and anaphylaxis.
  The suspected agents triggering these reactions were turnip seeds, cabbage, broccoli,
  oilseed rape, cauliflower, mustard, isothiocyanates in paint, and Diplotaxis erucoides
  \ pollen. It is important to note that 18 of the individuals  had previous risk
  factors such as atopy, allergies to allergens unrelated to cruciferous plants, different
  skin conditions, or asthma. Furthermore, 12 of those people had been exposed to
  the allergens occupationally, for chronic periods of time, presumably leading to
  the adverse events.\n\nTable 4: Case reports of adverse events associated with human
  exposure to cruciferous plants, their derivatives or their constituents.\n\nTwo
  case reports documented warfarin resistance in 3 patients with cardiovascular diseases.
  The first patient had a prosthetic aortic valve and a history of myocardial infarctions
  with prolonged prothrombin time. The second had pulmonary embolism, and the third
  suffered from an unspecified cardiovascular disease. The adverse event in the first
  patient was attributed to excessive consumption of lettuce and greens ; the patient
  was a 35 years old woman who intended to lose weight by consuming only the above-mentioned
  foods, which led to a consumption of 6000 g/day of vitamin K. After 5 weeks of dieting,
  she felt substernal chest pain and was referred to the hospital, where a myocardial
  infarction was diagnosed. She was treated with heparin and nitroglycerine. The second
  and third cases were attributed to chronic consumption of up to 450 g/day of broccoli;
  one of them required treatment with Coumadin. All three cases ended up in full resolution
  of adverse events and a recommendation to restrict consumption of vitamin K-rich
  foods.\n\nThe last case report reported a suspected toxic irritative dermatitis
  \ in an individual who applied a home-made mustard wrap in order to relieve the
  symptoms of bronchitis; authors believe the wrap may have contained some toxic compounds
  and concluded that the reaction was not an allergic one. Hence, they advised against
  the use of home-made wraps. The patient was treated with corticosteroids with full
  resolution. This case was very brief and lacked a great deal of information regarding
  previous medical history and whether other medications had been used to treat the
  patients bronchitis. Moreover, no test was conducted to verify the cause of the
  adverse event.\n\nOf the 317 papers excluded, 280 did not fulfill the criteria for
  our systematic review. Another 37 articles were excluded since they dealt with toxic
  oil syndrome. In order to promote transparency in our decision-making process, we
  shall explain the rationale behind excluding this latter group of papers.\n\nToxic
  oil syndrome is the name given to a disease outbreak in Spain in 1981. Its first
  appearance was as an acute lung disease, which was followed by a range of other
  chronic symptoms affecting the lungs, the liver, the kidneys, the skin, the joints,
  the central nervous system, and the immune system. The cause for the disease was
  traced to the consumption of cheap, refined, rapeseed oil that had been intended
  for industrial use rather than for human consumption. It was sold as olive oil and
  was therefore used for cooking. According to the World Health Organization, toxic
  compounds derived during the refinement process, used to remove the aniline and
  to denature oils intended for industrial use, were responsible for causing the disease.
  Hence, toxic oil syndrome has come to be considered a chemical incident, rather
  than a side effect associated with consumption of rapeseed oil, since consumption
  of non-industrial rapeseed oil does not cause the disease. In fact, the specific
  refinement process of the oil that caused the disease was so unique that experimental
  studies performed in a variety of laboratory animals have hitherto failed to reproduce
  the symptoms of human toxic oil syndrome.\n\nResearch conducted in the last decade
  supports the notion that some cruciferous plants and their derivatives may serve
  to prevent or attenuate several medical conditions. To further this field of investigation,
  we conducted this systematic paper to determine the safety parameters surrounding
  the use of cruciferous plants. In this regard, our review identified adverse events
  in 1335 individuals, out of a total of 101,198 individuals who were included in
  all studies. Of these, 1292 adverse events were ranked as only possibly or unlikely
  to be caused by cruciferous plants. Only 43 were determined to have been certainly
  or likely caused by exposure to cruciferous plants. Adverse events, which could
  certainly or likely be attributed to members of the Brassica genus, included allergic
  reactions, changes in metabolism of acetaminophen, phenacetin and warfarin, and
  warfarin resistance. Most adverse events reported in our paper were allergic or
  hypersensitivity reactions; however, their significance for the general healthy
  population is hard to infer, due to confounding medical histories or low causality
  ratings. Adverse events from both allergy trials and case reports were mostly in
  individuals who suffered from atopy, allergies to cruciferous plants and/or other
  allergens, asthma, or a variety of skin conditions such as eczema, pruritus, erythema,
  dermatitis, dryness and scaling, or blisters. A possible conclusion from these case
  reports, however, is that occupational exposure to Brassica plants may predispose
  to develop an allergy to these plants. With regards to observational studies which
  investigated allergies to cruciferous plants or their derivatives, all concluded
  that the cases could not be attributed to the suspected culprits.\n\nA second category
  of adverse events included changes in metabolism of phenacetin, acetaminophen, and
  warfarin. While phenacetin has been banned for use by the FDA, acetaminophen and
  warfarin continue to be widely used. As such, it was important to understand if
  these changes in metabolism pose any risk to those who use these drugs. As for acetaminophen,
  the authors explain that the decreased levels of the cysteine conjugate of acetaminophen
  found in subjects urine actually indicate decreased toxicity; thus, cruciferous
  plants may not pose any risk to individuals who consume acetaminophen. With regards
  to warfarin, however, the finding that cruciferous vegetables alter its metabolism
  might bear greater clinical relevance. It has been suggested that foods high in
  vitamin K, such as cruciferous vegetables, may interact with warfarin and its anticoagulant
  activity. In all case reports describing warfarin resistance, the patients had consumed
  very large amounts of cruciferous vegetables, amounts not warranted for consumption
  by the general population. However, it is possible that lower doses would have some
  effects on anticoagulation as well. Similarly large amounts of cruciferous vegetables
  \ were given to subjects in the SCED trial which examined changes in warfarin resistance.
  As many foods interact with warfarin, among which are mango, avocado, fish oil,
  soy milk, and foods high in vitamin K, it is imperative for physicians to discuss
  the consumption of such foods  with their patients when starting treatment with
  anticoagulants.\n\nReports of other types of adverse events identified in our systematic
  review, including cancer, chronic atrophic gastritis, infantile colic, and toxicity-related
  events, could only be ranked as possibly or unlikely to be caused by exposure to
  cruciferous plants, as there was not enough evidence to establish a stronger causal
  relationship between the suspected culprits and the adverse events. Further research
  employing better methodology should be undertaken in order to establish whether
  positive association exists between consumption of Brassica vegetables and any of
  the above-mentioned adverse events.\n\nFinally, a number of studies did not find
  any adverse events associated with consumption of cruciferous plants or their derivatives
  in subjects with a variety of health conditions, including history of myocardial
  infarction, nutritional deficits, or recurrent respiratory papillomatosis, or in
  healthy individuals.\n\nIn summary, to date, adverse events presumably related to
  cruciferous plants have been reported in 1335 individuals, identified through 50
  studies which included a total of 101,198 individuals. However, the number of those
  which were certainly/likely caused by Brassica plants  was much lower: only 43 of
  all reported adverse events received such high causality rating. For comparison,
  the literature shows that the pooled prevalence of adverse drug reactions ranges
  from 4.2 to 6%. This frequency, if applied to cruciferous plants, would translate
  into 4250-6072 reports of adverse events out of the included 101,198 individuals,
  a value much higher than what was found in our current study.\n\nWhen analysing
  our findings, one must bear in mind that the total number of individuals included
  in all studies comprises both those who were definitely exposed to Brassica plants
  and those who were presumptively exposed as the degree of exposure could not be
  ascertained in all cases. This might cause the frequency of occurrence of adverse
  events to appear lower than the actual value. On the other hand, our study also
  included case reports of individuals, all of whom were exposed, and reported adverse
  events. In this regard, the frequency of adverse events tends to be an overestimation,
  since individuals who are exposed, but do not experience an adverse event, are likely
  not to report. Hence, the inclusion of these case report, in which essentially all
  individuals exposed report adverse events, may serve to balance this underestimation.
  We advise the reader to treat the broad pooled frequency presented in the previous
  paragraph  as merely gross estimations of the actual frequency, as conducting a
  meta-analysis per se was deemed inappropriate given the heterogeneity of study parameters.\n\nWe
  conclude that cruciferous plants are generally safe for human consumption and use.
  However, individuals with known allergies/hypersensitivities to a certain member
  of the Brassica genus, or those taking warfarin, should consult with their physician
  before consuming such vegetables. In the future, if cruciferous derivatives are
  to be investigated as potential therapeutic agents, we recommend that adverse events
  be monitored. As our findings reflect positively on the safety of Brassica plants
  in humans and evidence from the current experimental literature of their benefit
  in certain disease states, we would encourage further exploration of their potential
  use in the clinical setting. The use of brassica or similar food products may have
  the potential to provide a safer alternative for the treatment of disease in comparison
  to current pharmaceutical interventions.\n\nJYY initiated the research question;
