  Gingerol  is one of the most frequently and heavily consumed dietary condiments
  throughout the world. The oleoresin from rhizomes of ginger contains -gingerol  and
  its homologs which are pungent ingredients that have been found to possess many
  interesting pharmacological and physiological activities, such as anti-inflammatory,
  antihepatotoxic and cardiotonic effects. However, the effects of -gingerol on metastatic
  processes in breast cancer cells are not currently well known. Therefore, in this
  study, we examined the effects of -gingerol on adhesion, invasion, motility, activity
  and the amount of MMP-2 or -9 in the MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cell line. We
  cultured MDA-MB-231 cells in the presence of various concentrations of -gingerol.
  -Gingerol had no effect on cell adhesion up to 5 microM, but resulted in a 16% reduction
  at 10 microM. Treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with increasing concentrations of -gingerol
  led to a concentration-dependent decrease in cell migration and motility. The activities
  of MMP-2 or MMP-9 in MDA-MB-231 cells were decreased by treatment with -gingerol
  and occurred in a dose-dependent manner. The amount of MMP-2 protein was decreased
  in a dose-dependent manner, although there was no change in the MMP-9 protein levels
  following treatment with -gingerol. MMP-2 and MMP-9 mRNA expression were decreased
  by -gingerol treatment. In conclusion, we have shown that -gingerol inhibits cell
  adhesion, invasion, motility and activities of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in MDA-MB-231 human
  breast cancer cell lines.'
