  of Gal-GalNAc-containing glycans and the enzymes involved in their synthesis for
  invasion and survival in brea.md
text: "\n\nTo study the influence of glycosylation on breast cancer progression by
  analyses on glycan, mRNA, and protein level. For detection of glycan structures,
  we performed lectin histochemistry with five lectins of different specificity  on
  a tissue microarray with &gt;400 breast cancer samples. For comparison, mRNA expression
  of glycosylation enzymes involved in the synthesis of HPA and PNA binding glycostructures
  \ was analyzed in microarray data of 194 carcinomas. Additionally, C1GALT1 protein
  expression was analyzed by Western blot analysis in 106 tumors. Correlations with
  clinical and histological parameters including recurrence-free  and overall survival
  \ were calculated. Positive binding of four lectins  correlated significantly with
  parameters involved in tumor metastasis, namely lymphangiosis, vascular invasion,
  lymph node involvement, and presence of disseminated tumor cells in bone marrow.
  HPA and PNA binding also showed a negative prognostic impact in our cohort. Correspondingly,
  high expression of C1GALT1, GALNT1, GALNT8, or GALNT14 mRNA and C1GALT1 protein
  correlated significantly with shorter OAS. Notably, combined overexpression of C1GALT1/GALNT1
  or C1GALT1/GALNT8 mRNA was associated with a significantly reduced OAS  and RFS,
  pointing to an additive influence of these enzymes. This prognostic impact retained
  significance in multivariate analysis including classical prognostic markers. Our
  data indicate that glycan structures containing GalGalNAc residues and the enzymes
  involved in their synthesis play a role in breast cancer progression, at least partly
  by their promoting influence on haematogenic and lymphatic spread.\n\nThe online
  version of this article  contains supplementary material, which is available to
  authorized users.\n\nMany proteins involved in breast cancer progression, especially
  cell adhesion molecules and secreted proteins, are heavily glycosylated. Since glycosylation
  has deep impact on the function of these proteins, the study of glycans has come
  into focus recently, and understanding the role of glycan alterations in breast
  cancer cells might give the opportunity for new prognostic markers and therapeutic
  strategies.\n\nFour main groups of glycans can be differentiated: O-glycans, N-glycans,
  glycosaminoglycans, and glycolipids. In O-glycosylation, a GalNAc residue is added
  to OH-groups of serine or threonine, whereas in N-glycans, a GlcNAc is added to
  an asparagine residue within a consensus peptide sequence. In a recent study based
  on mRNA expression data from 194 breast cancer patients, we found 25 glycosylation
  genes with independent prognostic impact in this cohort. Some of them could be validated
  in a second cohort  and were predictive of specific metastatic patterns, i.e., bone
  or brain metastasis. This observation emphasizes the important role of glycosylation
  in breast cancer progression.\n\nIn contrast to the study of glycosylation genes,
  a comprehensive analysis of glycans themselves in cancer tissues is technically
  unfeasible at the current state, since antibodies directed against specific carbohydrate
  structures are rare. In order to obtain some information about the glycosylation
  pattern of tumor cells, we therefore applied the well-known method of lectin histochemistry
  on a tissue microarray  including &gt;400 breast cancer samples and 72 lymph node
  metastases. Lectins are carbohydrate-binding proteins of plant, microbial, or animal
  origin which bind to specific glycan structures. Using five lectins with different
  specificities, we examined if specific glycan structures play a role in breast cancer
  progression.\n\nBased on our finding which revealed a prognostic impact of PNA and
  HPA, we further analyzed whether enzymes involved in synthesis of their ligands,
  namely GALNT family members and C1GALT1, correlate with clinical and histological
  tumor parameters. Our results point to an influence of GalGalNAc -containing O-glycans
  on lymphatic invasion and metastasis in breast cancer, and a strong prognostic impact
  of enzymes involved in their synthesis.\n\nFor lectin staining, a TMA containing
  tissue samples from 411 breast cancer patients treated at University Medical Center
  Hamburg-Eppendorf between 1999 and 2006 as well as 72 corresponding lymph node metastases
  was investigated. The diagnosis including evaluation of vascular invasion and lymphangiosis
  had been performed by pathologists, and routine immunohistochemical determination
  of estrogen receptor  and progesterone receptor  status had been performed.\n\nFor
  TMA generation, 0.6 mm cores were taken from invasive tumors. All cases are well
  characterized regarding follow-up information, presence of DTCs in bone marrow  and
  lymph node involvement. Patient data and tumor characteristics are described in
  Table 1. Due to loss of tissue spots during the staining procedure or lack of tumor
  cells in the spot, the number of evaluable primary tumors differed for the five
  lectins, ranging from 182 to 293. As control, large overview sections of 26 carcinomas
  which had been positive for at least one lectin on the TMA were analyzed.\n\nCohort
  characteristics of breast cancer patients analyzed by lectin histochemistryb  \n\nInformed
  consent for the scientific use of tissue materials, which was approved by the local
  ethics committee, was obtained from all patients. The study was performed in accordance
  to the principles of the declaration of Helsinki and REMARK criteria.\n\nLectin
  histochemistry was performed as described  using the following biotinylated lectins:
  Phaseolus vulgaris leukoagglutinin, Arachis hypogaea, Galanthus nivalis, Helix pomatia,
  and Ulex europaeus.\n\nFormalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections were deparaffinized
  and treated with 0.1 % trypsin  for 15 min at 37 C. Then they were incubated with
  the biotinylated lectins at 0.1 g/ml1 for 60 min, followed by an avidin-alkaline
  phosphatase complex. Control sections were incubated in the same way, omitting the
  lectins.\n\nStained TMA sections were digitalized using a Mirax Midi slide scanner
  \ and evaluated using the Panoramic Viewer program. Staining intensity was evaluated
  by two investigators  using the following categories: 0: no staining in tumor cells;
  \ minimal staining in few tumor cells;  weak staining;  weak to moderate staining;
  \ moderate staining;  moderate to strong staining;  strong staining. No discrimination
  between membraneous and cytoplasmic staining was performed, and positive staining
  in stromal cells was not evaluated. For correlations with clinical and histological
  characteristics, two groups of negative and minimal staining  and weak to strong
  lectin binding  were compared.\n\nIn order to visualize vascular and lymphatic invasion,
  CD31 and podoplanin  immunohistochemistry in large paraffin sections of selected
  cases  was performed with the following antibodies: monoclonal mouse anti-human
  CD31, endothelial, clone JC70A, and anti-D2-40 monoclonal antibody. For antigen
  retrieval, sections were first incubated for 20 min in hot pH6 citrate buffer  or
  pH9 target retrieval solution  before overnight incubation at 4 C with the primary
  antibodies. Detection was performed with Vectastain Elite ABC KitPeroxidase  and
  the DAB Peroxidase Substrate Kit.\n\nIn order to investigate the mRNA expression
  of GalNT1-14 and C1GALT1, microarray data  from an independent cohort of 194 mammary
  carcinomas from our clinic were analyzed. The clinical and histological characteristics
  of this cohort as well as technical details have been described  and are given in
  Supplementary Table S1. All microarray data have been submitted to Gene Expression
  Omnibus  under the following accession numbers: GSE26971, GSE31519, GSE31519, and
  GSE46184 (samples GSM1125783-GSM112856.\n\nFor validation of C1GALT1 mRNA data,
  Western blot analysis with 106 tumors from the same cohort was performed. Tissue
  samples of around 100 mg were homogenized in RIPA buffer using a Precellys Homogenisator.
  Only samples with a tumor cell content of &gt;50 % as shown in H&amp;E-stained cryo-cut
  sections were used for protein extraction. SDS-PAGE of 20 g proteins per sample
  and transfer to Immobilon membranes were performed as described. C1GALT1 was detected
  by a monoclonal antibody  diluted 1:200, with MDA-MB231 cell extracts as positive
  control. As control for protein loading, the membranes were reprobed with anti-GAPDH
  antibody. Band intensities were quantified by densitometry  and calculated as percent
  intensity of the control sample.\n\nStatistical analysis was conducted by using
  SPSS software Version 21. Correlations between the lectin staining results were
  examined using two-sided Pearson tests. For further analysis, all tumors were divided
  into two groups representing negative/minimal  and low, moderate, and high staining
  intensity  for each lectin.  2-tests were used to examine correlations between lectin
  staining and clinicopathologic factors. Survival was analyzed by KaplanMeier analysis
  and Log-Rank Tests. Cox regression models were calculated for uni- and multivariate
  analysis. Probability values less than 0.05 were regarded as statistically significant.\n\nSince
  the results of our prior RNA analysis revealed a significant prognostic value of
  enzymes involved in O\\- and N-glycosylation, we performed lectin histochemistry
  using 5 lectins with different specificity  using TMA paraffin sections including
  411 breast cancer samples.\n\nCorrelations of UEA-I, HPA, GNA, PNA, and PHA-L lectin
  staining with clinical and histological parameters  \n\naFor Chi-square tests and
  log-rank analysis, the following groups were compared: UEA-I, negative/minimal  versus
  positive binding ; for HPA, negative/minimal  versus positive binding ; GNA, negative/minimal
  \ versus positive binding ; PNA, negative/minimal  versus positive binding, PHA-L,
  negative/minimal  versus positive binding \n\nbFor KaplanMeier analysis, the same
  groups were compared except for HPA: negative results  versus any positive binding.
  Significant results  are shown in bold\n\nRepresentative staining results and distribution
  of scoring values are shown in Fig. 1. Positive results were observed for UEA-1
  in 10.5 % of the samples, for HPA in 38.1 %, for GNA in 20.7 %, for PNA in 33.1
  %, and for PHA-L in 64.5 % of the tumors. The staining pattern was mostly membranous
  for HPA, UEA-I, and PHA-L, membranous and cytoplasmic for PNA, and mostly cytoplasmic
  with a granular pattern for GNA. By Pearson tests, significant associations  were
  found between the results for UEA-I and GNA, HPA and PNA, and GNA and PNA. Lectin
  staining in large sections of 26 tumors which had been positive for at least one
  lectin largely confirmed the TMA-based results indicating rather homogeneous staining
  patterns within the tumors.\n\nLectin histochemistry on breast cancer samples. Representative
  HPA, UEA-I, GNA, PNA, and PHA-L binding results showing examples with negative/minimal
  staining  or positive staining. On the right side, the distribution of IHC scoring
  results ranging from 0  to 6  is shown\n\nRegarding histological and clinical tumor
  parameters, we found significant positive correlations of GNA, PNA, and PHA-L binding
  to vascular invasion. In addition, HPA and PNA binding were associated with lymphangiosis,
  and HPA, PNA, and PHA-L binding correlated to lymph node involvement. In Fig. 2ag,
  some examples of lectin-positive tumors showing invasion into CD31-positive blood
  vessels and/or podoplanin-positive lymphatic vessels are shown. Regarding DTCs in
  bone marrow, only HPA binding showed a significant association. UEA-I and PHA-L
  correlated with advanced stage, and PHA-L positivity was significantly associated
  with high grading and a negative PR status. No significant correlation with age,
  histological subtype, and ER status was found.\n\nAssociation of lectin staining
  with vascular and lymphatic invasion of mammary carcinomas. ac, poorly differentiated
  carcinoma showing positive PNA binding, invasion into CD31-positive capillaries,
  and into Podoplanin -positive lymphatic vessels. de, poorly differentiated carcinoma
  showing PNA binding  and invasion into PDPN-positive lymphatic vessels. fg, poorly
  differentiated carcinoma showing positive HPA staining  and invasion into a larger
  lymphatic duct. hj, correlation of GNA and PNA positivity with vascular invasion
  \ and correlation of HPA and PNA staining with lymphangiosis  as documented in pathological
  reports. p values after Chi square tests are given\n\nUsing long-term follow-up
  information for our cohort, PNA binding was significantly associated with shorter
  OAS, whereas its association with RFS did not reach significance. In addition, HPA
  binding was weakly associated with shorter RFS, but not with OAS. The prognostic
  significance of HPA was more clear cut if completely negative tumors were compared
  to those showing any positivity. Here HPA staining correlated significantly with
  RFS, and was weakly associated with shorter OAS. This prognostic value retained
  its significance for RFS in multivariate Cox regression analysis, whereas PNA staining
  lost its statistical significance. For UEA-I, GNA, and PHA-L binding, no association
  with RFS or OAS was found.\n\nKaplanMeier analysis of RFS and OAS based on HPA and
  PNA lectin binding. a all primary tumors. b ER-negative carcinomas. For HPA staining,
  the dashed line represents lectin-negative tumors, the solid line lectin-positive
  cases. For PNA, negative/minimal binding  was compared to clearly positive staining
  results. p values after log-rank tests are shown\n\nIn order to compare different
  molecular subtypes, we performed a stratified analysis of ER-positive and ER-negative
  carcinomas. By this approach, PNA binding turned out as strong prognostic indicator
  in ER-negative, but not ER-positive tumors. PNA staining was associated with significantly
  reduced OAS  and RFS  in this subgroup. In contrast, HPA binding predominantly correlated
  with shorter RFS in ER-positive carcinomas. UEA-I, GNA, and PHA-L binding was not
  associated with survival in these subgroups.\n\nFor 72 carcinomas, the TMA included
  not only primary tumors, but also lymph node metastases. The number of evaluable
  metastases differed from 38  to 62. Compared to primary tumors, the percentage of
  lymph node metastases showing positive lectin binding  was slightly higher: 18 %
  \ versus 10 %  UEA-I-positive; 46 versus 38 % HPA-positive; 32 versus 21 % GNA-positive;
  35 versus 33 % PNA-positive; 84 versus 65 % PHA-L-positive. In several cases, primary
  tumors and corresponding lymph node metastases could be compared for lectin binding.
  After blinded evaluation, identical results  or a change of only one scoring category
  was found in most tumors. Thus, the glycan patterns of the tumors seem to be generally
  stable during metastatic progression.\n\nBased on the prognostic relevance of HPA
  and PNA, we investigated if a similar impact can be found for glycosylation enzymes
  involved in the synthesis of their corresponding ligand structures. HPA mainly recognizes
  terminal N-acetyl galactosaminyl  residues, and GalNAc binding to serine or threonine
  residues in the Golgi is performed by members of the UDP-GalNAc:polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase
  \ family of 14 enzymes  with different, but overlapping substrate specificities
  and patterns of expression. Addition of galactose to this GalNAc residue in beta
  1,3-linkage by a glycoprotein-N-acetylgalactosamine 3-beta-galactosyltransferase
  \ results in formation of a suitable PNA ligand  which can be further elongated
  by additional sugar residues.\n\nPrognostic influence of C1GALT1 and GALNT family
  members. a Representation of the first steps of O-glycan biosynthesis relevant to
  this study and the role of GALNT family members and C1GALT1 in generation of lectin
  ligands. b Correlation of C1GALT1 protein expression with recurrence-free survival
  and overall survival in breast cancer patients. On top, representative Western blot
  analysis of thirteen breast cancer patients  and the control cell line  are shown.
  c KaplanMeier analysis showing the prognostic value of C1GALT1 mRNA expression  as
  well as C1GALT1/GALNT1 and C1GALT1/GALNT8 combinations in breast cancer patients.
  For combination of two genes, four different groups were compared using the median
  expression levels as cut-off: low expression of both genes, C1GALT1low/GALNThigh,
  C1GALT1high/GALNTlow, and high expression of both genes. p values after Log-rank
  tests are shown \n\nIn order to study the prognostic impact of these enzymes, we
  analyzed cDNA microarray data from 194 patients. Table 3 shows the expression levels
  of all GALNT family members present on the Affymetrix chip  and C1GALT1. By Cox
  regression analysis, high expression  of GALNT1, GALNT8, GALNT14, and C1GALT1 was
  associated with a significantly reduced overall survival, whereas GALNT11 was associated
  with longer OAS. In addition, longer RFS was significantly associated with high
  GALNT8 and low GALNT11 expression.\n\nmRNA expression and prognostic value of GALNT
  family members and C1GALT1 in mammary carcinomas  \n\na p values after univariate
  Cox regression analysis are given. Significant results are shown in bold\n\nSince
  C1GALT1 was the most significant predictor of OAS, we verified its prognostic impact
  on protein level in 106 carcinomas from the same cohort. After Western blot analysis,
  the resulting C1GALT1 protein expression values correlated significantly with the
  corresponding mRNA data. In addition, high C1GALT1 protein expression was significantly
  associated with shorter RFS, whereas its correlation with OAS did not reach statistical
  significance.\n\nFurther analysis revealed correlations with histological or clinical
  tumor characteristics : Both C1GALT1 mRNA and protein overexpression were significantly
  associated with nodal involvement, and a negative estrogen receptor  and progesterone
  receptor status.\n\nSince PNA binding was an adverse prognostic indicator and PNA
  ligands arise from the activity of at least one GALNT family member and C1GALT1,
  we presumed that combined analysis of two relevant enzymes  might enhance their
  prognostic impact. Therefore, we combined C1GALT1 mRNA results with GALNT1, GALNT8,
  or GALNT14 data, leading to four groups for each combination. By survival analysis,
  it could be shown that high expression of two enzymes  had a strong adverse prognostic
  impact which exceeded the influence of only one enzyme. In contrast, combination
  with GALNT14 expression did not increase the prognostic significance of C1GALNT1.\n\nIn
  multivariate Cox regression analyses including stage, nodal involvement, histological
  grading, and ER status, the C1GALT1high/GALNT1high combination retained its prognostic
  significance for overall survival and recurrence-free survival with hazard ratios
  of 2.67 and 1.96, respectively. Similarly, the combination C1GALT1high/GALNT8high
  was an independent predictor of shorter OAS and RFS with hazard ratios of 2.36 and
  1.78.\n\nMultivariate Cox regression analysis including FIGO stage, nodal involvement,
  histological grading, ER status and C1GALT1/GALNT combinations   \n\nCell surface
  glycans are involved in various biological functions, e.g., cell proliferation,
  differentiation, adhesion, and signal-transduction. In cancer, alterations in glycosylation
  can provide invasiveness and the potential to metastasize. Due to technical limitations,
  experimental data exist for only few glycan structures: Lewis y antigen significantly
  enhanced the Human epididymis protein 4 -mediated invasion and metastasis of ovarian
  cancer cells. In addition, presence of sialyl-Lewis on colon cancer cells increased
  xenograft growth and angiogenesis, and removal of fucose moieties by fucosidase
  treatment of breast cancer cells decreased their invasive potential. The importance
  of glycosylation processes is also underlined by the high amount of genes involved
  in glycan synthesis and modification. In a recent study on glycosylation genes in
  breast cancer tissue, we identified 25 genes with independent prognostic value in
  this tumor entity.\n\nIn order to confirm the role of altered glycosylation for
  breast cancer progression, we performed lectin histochemistry with five lectins
  of different specificity in a large cohort of breast cancer patients. A special
  feature of this cohort was the availability of information regarding metastasis-related
  parameters, namely lymphatic invasion, lymph node involvement, vascular invasion,
  and the presence of DTCs in bone marrow. Unexpectedly, four of five lectins  correlated
  significantly with one or more of these parameters, suggesting that glycosylation
  promotes metastasis by its positive influence on vascular or lymphatic invasion.\n\nGlycosylation
  of adhesion proteins strongly influences their adhesive properties. Since cell adhesion
  to components of the extracellular matrix, endothelial and/or lymphendothelial cells
  is a prerequisite for cell migration, invasion, and haematogenic or lymphogenic
  spread, glycosylation might also influence the metastatic potential of tumor cells.
  The differences in results for the five lectins show that specific glycan structures
  play different roles in this process.\n\nUlex europaeus lectin  binding indicating
  -linked fucose residues has been shown to be associated with short RFS in a smaller
  breast cancer cohort, but not in our patients. In contrast, HPA staining correlated
  significantly with lymphangiosis, positive lymph node involvement, the presence
  of DTCs in bone marrow and shorter RFS in our cohort. HPA ligands  are carried by
  a number of important cell surface proteins, i.e., CD44, MUC1, or Integrin 6. In
  prior studies, HPA binding correlated with a metastatic phenotype of breast cancer
  cells  and inhibited tumor cell interactions with endothelial cells. Regarding the
  prognostic significance of HPA in breast cancer, conflicting results were reported
  \ which might be due to experimental details. In our cohort, the prognostic significance
  of HPA was dependent on the cut-off used for evaluation of the staining results.\n\nIn
  contrast to HPA, the role of GNA  binding to breast cancer cells has not been investigated
  so far. GNA detects a high-mannose tree of N-glycans, and GNA binding results in
  cell death and antitumor activity in vitro. In our breast cancer cohort, GNA binding
  showed significant correlations with vascular invasion and advanced FIGO stage,
  but was not associated with survival in these patients.\n\nSimilar to GNA, little
  is known about the role of PHA-L binding in cancer, although it was associated with
  advanced malignant potential in breast and colon tumours. -1,6-branched oligosaccharides
  as detected by PHA-L binding had an independent prognostic impact in colorectal
  carcinoma, and in our recent study, cytoplasmic PHA-L staining was associated with
  poor prognosis in prostate cancer patients. Our present results indicate that although
  total PHA-L binding correlates with vascular invasion and lymph node involvement,
  it did not show any prognostic impact in breast cancer, indicating that PHA-L binding
  structures are not sufficient for promotion of metastasis.\n\nThe most promising
  lectin was PNA that mainly recognizes GalGalNAc structures on glycoproteins. In
  lung adenocarcinoma, PNA staining correlated with nodal involvement. In our present
  cohort, PNA showed significant associations with lymphangiosis, vascular invasion,
  lymph node involvement, and shorter OAS. Interestingly, high expression of the TF
  antigen which represents a major PNA ligand has not only been shown in node-positive
  breast cancer, but also on DTCs in bone marrow, suggesting that it might be used
  as a target for antibody-based therapy. In stratified analysis, the negative prognostic
  impact of PNA binding in our cohort turned out to be due to a strong correlation
  with shorter RFS and OAS in ER-negative, but not in ER-positive patients. Similar
  to our study of glycosylation enzymes, these results point to molecular subtype-specific
  influences of glycosylation on breast cancer metastasis.\n\nFor comparison with
  lectin staining, we analyzed the expression of enzymes involved in the synthesis
  of HPA and PNA ligands, eleven GALNT family members and C1GALT1, in a second breast
  cancer cohort from our clinic. Interestingly, C1GALT1 and three GALNT enzymes  were
  associated with an unfavorable prognosis, and the highest risk for early recurrence
  or death was found for patients with high expression of both C1GALT1 and GALNT-1
  or -8, pointing to an additive effect of these enzymes. For C1GALT1, we could demonstrate
  a strong correlation of mRNA and protein expression levels indicating transcriptional
  regulation of this enzyme. Interestingly, these genes were not among those genes
  with prognostic significance identified in a prior study using the same dataset
  \ which obviously derives from different statistical approaches. Obviously, continuous
  increase of expression values for C1GALT1, GALNT1, GALNT8, and GALNT14 did not have
  a significant impact on mortality, whereas differentiation between low and high
  expression levels  of these genes resulted in significant differences in patient
  outcome, pointing to non-linear associations with recurrence or mortality.\n\nTo
  our knowledge, this is the first report of a prognostic influence of C1GALT1 in
  breast cancer. In experimental systems, activity of this enzyme showed an oncogenic
  effect: it enhanced proliferation and invasive potential of hepatocarcinoma cells
  via glycosylation of MET and integrin 1  and promoted invasion of colon carcinoma
  cells via FGFR2 glycosylation. Which C1GALT1 substrate proteins are responsible
  for the clear prognostic effect of this enzyme in breast cancer should be investigated
  in further studies.\n\nRegarding GALNT family members, GALNT14 increases proliferation,
  motility, and invasion of MCF7 breast cancer cells. In addition, GALNT6 was shown
  to transform mammary epithelial cells in vitro, but had no prognostic impact. GALNT1
  plays a role in bladder cancer through aberrant glycosylation of integrin 3. To
  date, no other studies concerning the prognostic influence of these enzymes in cancer
  patients have been published.\n\nIn contrast to PNA binding which is dependent on
  the activity of at least one GALNT and C1GALT1, the combined prognostic effect of
  these enzymes is more clear cut and not restricted to ER-negative tumors. Obviously,
  expression of these two glycosylation enzymes must not necessarily correlate with
  the presence of a PNA ligand. The activity of additional glycosylation enzymes  leading
  to larger, more complex O-glycans might alter these structures in a way that retains
  their biological properties but modifies lectin binding. Thus, the poor prognosis
  of GALNThigh/C1GALT1high tumors indicates that these genes are involved in the synthesis
  of glycan structures which play an important role in tumor progression, but are
  not always PNA binding. Unfortunately, a direct comparison of enzyme expression
  and lectin binding in the same tumors could not be performed in our study.\n\nTaken
  together, our data indicate that glycan structures containing GalGalNAc residues
  play a role in breast cancer progression, at least partly by their positive influence
  on vascular and lymphatic invasion. Therefore, these glycans and the enzymes involved
  in their synthesis might represent promising new targets for breast cancer therapy.\n\nWe
