text: "\n\nYerba mate is defined as the product constituted by the dried, slightly
  roasted, and milled leaves of Ilex paraguariensis. However, the fruits of this species
  are often found in the commercial product. Nowadays the fruits are considered a
  byproduct. The objective of this work was to obtain the preliminary data of minerals,
  lipids, methylxanthines and polyphenols in the ripe fruits of I. paraguariensis.
  The results showed a considerable amount of total dietary fiber  and nutritionally
  valuable minerals: potassium, iron, magnesium, calcium, copper, zinc, and sodium.
  The lipid content was 4.5 g/100 g. Oleic acid was the predominant unsaturated fatty
  acid. Linoleic acid  was also present. Methylxanthines were quantified: caffeine
  \ and theobromine  g/100 g. The total polyphenol content was  g/100 g. The results
  obtained in this work suggest the potential value of the fruits of I. paraguariensis
  for the development of novel products in the food and pharmaceutical industries.
  This paper aims to contribute to the scientific knowledge of a natural by-product
  from industry regarding the need of foods and medicines for the new millennium.\n\nIlex
  paraguariensis St. Hilaire  is a native tree from Northeastern Argentina, Southern
  Brazil, and Eastern Paraguay, where it is also cultivated. It is one of the most
  known and used species in South America since the product obtained from its industrialization,
  yerba mate, is used to prepare a tea-like beverage  that is appreciated for its
  peculiar flavour and stimulating, antioxidant, choleretic, and nutritional properties.
  The leaves are also used in folk medicine to treat arthritis, headache, constipation,
  rheumatism, obesity, fatigue, fluid retention, and liver disorders. This species
  is exported to Europe, US, Syria, and Japan where it is marketed as a milled plant
  or extracts used in herbal formulations and functional food products with stimulating,
  diuretic, antioxidant, and weight-reducing properties. Yerba mate is included in
  Codex Alimentarius, Argentine Food Code, Latin-American Food Code, and the main
  scientific acknowledgment Pharmacopoeias. Nowadays it is also considered a functional
  food. According to the Argentine Food Code, yerba mate is defined as the product
  constituted exclusively by the dried, slightly roasted, and milled leaves of I.
  paraguariensis which can contain fragments of young branches, pedicles, and floral
  peduncles. However and as a result of the elaboration process, the fruits of this
  species may be present in the final product which has been consumed over centuries.
  The fruit is in a nucule and can reach a diameter of approximately 7 mm; there are
  four or five single-seed pyrenes. Mate flowers from October to November and fruiting
  occurs from December to May. During the ripening process, the fruit color changes
  from green to white, reddish-brown, and finally black when it is fully ripe. There
  is a rudimentary embryo in many externally ripe seeds which causes a long period
  of germination. \n\nThe maximum allowed content of fruit or organic material in
  the final product is 1 g/100 g. The great quantity of fruits remaining after the
  yerba mate processing is discarded.\n\nArgentina is the main yerba mate producer
  country, with nearly 280000 tons per year followed by Brazil and Paraguay. The worldwide
  production of yerba mate has ascended to 874678 tons in 2002. Nonofficial data suggest
  that Argentina could generate about 560 tons per year of fruits, and the global
  annual production could exceed 1700 tons per year. Nowadays the fruits have no economic
  value and they are treated as waste and used as fertilizer. \n\nThe objective of
  this work was to assess the preliminary data on the nutritional valuable elements,
  the methylxanthines and total polyphenol content of the ripe fruits of I. paraguariensis
  in order to study their potential value as a source of ingredients to be used in
  the food and pharmaceutical industries. \n\nRipe fruits of I. paraguariensis were
  provided by a yerba mate factory located in Gobernador Valentn Virasoro in the province
  of Corrientes, Argentina. The production process of yerba mate involves the harvest
  of the green leaves and small stems of this species which contain fruits. They are
  cut manually, put into 100 kg sacks, and then carried to the factory. After harvesting,
  they were submitted to a roasting process named sapecado  and then to a drying process.
  \n\nThe fruits analyzed in this work were harvested in April 2009. They were dark
  reddish-brown in color, with a diameter of 4 to 6 mm. They were identified by PhD.
  Gustavo Gibeti, botanical specialist in Ilex spp. Comparison with voucher specimens
  of herbarium standards was done. A sample was deposited in the Herbarium Botany
  Unit of the Faculty of Pharmacy and Biochemistry of the University of Buenos Aires
  under number BACP: BAF 2. In our laboratory, the fruits were dried in a stove with
  hot air circulation and thermostatized at 40C  and then milled to fine powder with
  a cutter mill with 1 mm pore mesh.\n\nStandard solutions CertiPUR Merck Chemicals
  International were employed for the determination of the mineral content. A mixture
  of fatty acid methyl esters standards from SUPELCO FAME Mix NHI-C and FAME Mix C4C24
  were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Buenos Aires, Argentina. Standards of caffeine
  and theobromine were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Argentina. All solvents and reagents
  used in the experimental work were analytical-grade chemicals except those used
  in the high-resolution analytical methods which were HPLC grade and purchased from
  Merck Chemicals Argentina. \n\nThe recommended methods of the Association of Official
  Analytical Chemists  were adopted to determine the levels of moisture, ash, protein,
  crude fat, and total dietary fiber. The moisture content was determined by heating
  5.0 g of each sample to a constant weight in a crucible placed in an oven maintained
  at 70C under pressure. Ash was determined by calcinations of 3.0 g of each sample
  placed in muffle furnace maintained at 550C until constant weight. Protein  was
  determined by the Kjeldahl method using 1.0 g samples. Fat content was determined
  gravimetrically after petroleum ether extraction  of 5.0 g samples.\n\nTotal dietary
  fiber  was determined by the enzymatic-gravimetric method. The total carbohydrate
  content was defined as the residue, excluding protein, lipid, TDF, and ash, and
  was calculated as follows: \n\nTest samples  were digested in 15 mL HNO3/HCLO4  according
  to AOAC, and sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, copper, iron, and zinc were
  determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. \n\nMilled fruits  were homogenized
  and lipids were extracted with n-hexane by lixiviation until total extraction. The
  organic solvent was evaporated under vacuum and the oil obtained was esterified.
  Methyl esters were prepared by transmethylation according to the procedure of the
  International Organization for Standardization   and analyzed by gas chromatography.
  \n\nThe fatty acid methyl esters were analyzed using a Clarus 500 Perkin Elmer gas
  chromatography device equipped with a flame ionization detector  and the TotalChrom
  software. A fused silica capillary column SP 2560   was employed. The column temperature
  was programmed as follows: 150C, a gradient ranging from 150C to 210C for 20min
  at a rate of 5C/min. The injection port and detector were maintained at 240C and
  280C, respectively. As carrier gas nitrogen was employed at a gas linear speed of
  1.3 mL min1. The individual fatty acids were identified by comparison of retention
  times and peak areas with those of known mixtures of fatty acid methyl esters  standards.\n\nBriefly,
  500 mg of each sample were placed in a 250 mL round-bottom flask containing 50 mL
  of methanol and extracted during 30 minutes under a reflux condenser and then filtered.
  The residue was subjected to the same procedure twice. The filtrates were then combined
  and dried in a rotary evaporator. The extract obtained was solubilized in 20 mL
  of water: acetic acid  and transferred to a 25 mL flask. Methanol was added to reach
  a final volume. A 45 m filter  was used to filter the extract before HPLC analysis.
  \n\nA Varian series 9000 equipment with a Varian 9012 binary pump was used. Quantitation
  of methylxanthine was done using validated HPLC external standard methods. A reverse-phase
  IB-SIL RP 18  Phenomenex column and an elution gradient consisting of solvent A:
  water : acetic acid  and solvent B: methanol : acetic acid  were used. The elution
  gradient was: from 17% B to 20% B, 10 min; 20% B, 5 min; 20% B to 23% B, 10 min;
  23% B to 100% B, 5 min with a flow rate of 1.0 mLmin1. Identification and quantitation
  were carried out by simultaneous detection with an UV Varian 9050 UV detector and
  a Varian 9065 photodiode array detector operating at 273 nm. Samples were injected
  with a Rheodyne injector fitted with a 100 L loop.\n\nThe total polyphenol content
  was determined by spectrophotometry according to the Folin-Ciocalteu method  using
  gallic acid as standard. Exactly around 1.0 mg of methanolic extract was weighted
  and dissolved in 10 mL of deionized distilled water. Briefly, 1.0 mL of this sample
  extract was transferred in duplicate to separate tubes containing 7.0 mL distilled
  water, 0.5 mL of Folin-Ciocalteus reagent, and 1.5 mL of a 20% sodium carbonate
  anhydrous solution. The tubes were then allowed to stand at room temperature for
  60min and then the absorbance at 765 nm was measured by employing a UV-Vis spectrophotometer.
  The concentration of polyphenols in samples was derived from a standard curve of
  gallic acid ranging from 10 to 50 g/mL. \n\nData were expressed as means  standard
  error of the mean of three independent experiments of the same batch carried out
  by triplicate. \n\nThe results of moisture content, ash, lipids, proteins, carbohydrates,
  and fiber are presented in Table 1. The fruits presented considerable amounts of
  total dietary fiber   and carbohydrates. \n\nSince the mid- 1970s, the role of dietary
  fibers in health and nutrition has received considerable attention. The consumption
  of dietary and functional fibers has many potential health benefits, namely, the
  ability to lower the incidence of constipation  and irritable bowel syndrome, to
  lower cholesterol levels and diminish the incidence of coronary and cardiovascular
  heart diseases  to prevent obesity  and the development of diabetes, to avoid colon
  cancer, and to increase survival of patients with breast cancer. \n\nDietary fiber-rich
  products have gained popularity as food ingredients to obtain health benefits and
  have encouraged food scientists to search for new fiber sources as well as to develop
  high-fiber products. \n\nIn the agricultural byproducts of some fruits and greens,
  TDF content ranges from 10.2 to 87.9 g/100 g. In this work, the insoluble dietary
  fiber   was the predominant fiber fraction. Similar results were reported for pear
  pomace  and apple pomace. \n\nThe crude protein content was found to be 5.5 g/100
  g and the crude lipids 4.5 g/100 g dry matter. The lipid content is similar to that
  reported for the aerial parts of legumes, which is about 4-5g/100 g dry matter.
  \n\nThe mineral content  was determined. I. paraguariensis fruits contain significant
  amounts of essential minerals that are associated with improved health status when
  consumed at doses beyond those necessary for preventing a deficiency state. The
  results obtained in this work are presented in Table 2. As it is shown, the most
  abundant mineral elements were potassium, iron, and magnesium which represent the
  66%, 64%, and 48% of the daily allowances recommended for adults in the 2550 year
  age range. The high quantity of these elements together with the quantity of calcium
  and the content of the essential elements zinc and copper allow the fruits to be
  considered as excellent sources of bioelements. \n\nThe yield of fatty acids obtained
  from the fruits was  g/100 g, where oleic acid as the predominant unsaturated fatty
  acid reaching a 38.74 g/100 g. Linoleic acid, one of the most important polyunsaturated
  fatty acids in human food and was also present. Linoleic acid prevents cardiovascular
  disorders high blood pressure and is part of the structural components of the plasma
  membrane. Palmitic and stearic acids were also found at high levels in the lipidic
  fraction. \n\nCaffeine and theobromine were identified and quantified. Theophylline
  was not detected. Results are presented in Table 4. The presence of caffeine in
  the unripe fruits of this plant has been reported previously and was found to be
  0.04 g/100 g. The caffeine and theobromine content  and  found in this work were
  higher than those reported by other authors. For example, Schubert et al., who also
  investigated the unripe fruits, reported an amount of  mg/g of total methylxanthines,
  a value which is also lower than our results. These discrepancies could be due to
  the fact that our material consisted in the ripe fruits of I. paraguariensis and
  the results previously reported were obtained from the unripe ones. This is the
  first study on the methylxanthines content in the ripe fruits of I. paraguariensis.
  \n\nThe total polyphenol content found in this work was  g/100 g gallic acid equivalents,
  dry wet. The amount of polyphenols found here was higher than those reported by
  other authors who studied the unripe fruits. Schubert et al.  found  to  4 mg/g.
  Borr et al.  found 0.03% of chlorogenic acid. These differences could indicate that
  the ripe fruits contain higher amounts of polyphenols than the unripe ones. This
  is the first study on the polyphenol content in the ripe fruits of I. paraguariensis.\n\nThis
  paper aims to contribute to the scientific knowledge of a natural by-product from
  industry regarding the need of foods and medicines for the new millennium.\n\nThe
  results obtained in this work suggest the potential value of the fruits as a fiber
  and valuable mineral source. These fruits could also be a source of bioactive compounds
  such as methylxanthines and polyphenols. The utilization of this material could
  become profitable and at the same time help to minimize waste disposal problems.
  The results obtained in this work suggest the potential value of the fruits of Ilex
  paraguariensis for the development of novel products in the food and pharmaceutical
  industries. \n\nThis work was supported by Grant UBACYT 20020100100158 from the
  University of Buenos Aires.\n"
