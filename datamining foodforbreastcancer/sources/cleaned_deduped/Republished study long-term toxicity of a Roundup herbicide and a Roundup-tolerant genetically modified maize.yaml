  study long-term toxicity of a Roundup herbicide and a Roundup-tolerant genetically
  modified maize.md
text: "\n\nThe health effects of a Roundup-tolerant NK603 genetically modified  maize,
  cultivated with or without Roundup application and Roundup alone  in drinking water,
  were evaluated for 2 years in rats. This study constitutes a follow-up investigation
  of a 90-day feeding study conducted by Monsanto in order to obtain commercial release
  of this GMO, employing the same rat strain and analyzing biochemical parameters
  on the same number of animals per group as our investigation. Our research represents
  the first chronic study on these substances, in which all observations including
  tumors are reported chronologically. Thus, it was not designed as a carcinogenicity
  study. We report the major findings with 34 organs observed and 56 parameters analyzed
  at 11 time points for most organs. \n\nBiochemical analyses confirmed very significant
  chronic kidney deficiencies, for all treatments and both sexes; 76% of the altered
  parameters were kidney-related. In treated males, liver congestions and necrosis
  were 2.5 to 5.5 times higher. Marked and severe nephropathies were also generally
  1.3 to 2.3 times greater. In females, all treatment groups showed a two- to threefold
  increase in mortality, and deaths were earlier. This difference was also evident
  in three male groups fed with GM maize. All results were hormone- and sex-dependent,
  and the pathological profiles were comparable. Females developed large mammary tumors
  more frequently and before controls; the pituitary was the second most disabled
  organ; the sex hormonal balance was modified by consumption of GM maize and Roundup
  treatments. Males presented up to four times more large palpable tumors starting
  600 days earlier than in the control group, in which only one tumor was noted. These
  results may be explained by not only the non-linear endocrine-disrupting effects
  of Roundup but also by the overexpression of the EPSPS transgene or other mutational
  effects in the GM maize and their metabolic consequences. \n\nOur findings imply
  that long-term  feeding trials need to be conducted to thoroughly evaluate the safety
  of GM foods and pesticides in their full commercial formulations. \n\nGenetically

  natural and social sciences produce knowledge  which should describe and explain
  past and present phenomena and estimate their future development. To this end quantitative
  methods are used. Progress in science needs controversial debates aiming at the
  best methods as basis for objective, reliable and valid results approximating what
  could be the truth. Such methodological competition is the energy needed for scientific
  progress. In this sense, ESEU aims to enable rational discussions dealing with the
  article from G.-E. Sralini et al.  by re-publishing it. By doing so, any kind of
  appraisal of the papers content should not be connoted. The only aim is to enable
  scientific transparency and, based on this, a discussion which does not hide but
  aims to focus methodological controversies. -Winfried Schrder, Editor of the Thematic
  Series Implications for GMO-cultivation and monitoring in Environmental Sciences
  Europe.\n\nThere is an ongoing international debate as to the necessary length of
  mammalian toxicity studies, including metabolic analyses, in relation to the consumption
  of genetically modified  plants. Currently, no regulatory authority requires mandatory
  chronic animal feeding studies to be performed for edible genetically modified organisms,
  or even short-term studies with blood analyses for the full commercial formulations
  of pesticides as sold and used, but only for the declared active principle alone.
  However, several 90-day rat feeding trials have been conducted by the agricultural
  biotechnology industry. These investigations mostly concern GM soy and maize that
  are engineered either to be herbicide-tolerant  in 80% of cases), or to produce
  a modified Bt toxin insecticide, or both. As a result, these GM crops contain new
  pesticide residues for which new maximum residue levels  have been established in
  some countries. \n\nThough the petitioners conclude in general that no major physiological
  changes is attributable to the consumption of the GMO in subchronic toxicity studies,
  significant disturbances have been found and may be interpreted differently. A detailed
  analysis of the data in the subchronic toxicity studies  has revealed statistically
  significant alterations in kidney and liver function that may constitute signs of
  the early onset of chronic toxicity. This may be explained at least in part by pesticide
  residues in the GM feed. Indeed, it has been demonstrated that R concentrations
  in the range of 103 times below the MRL can induce endocrine disturbances in human
  cells  and toxic effects thereafter. This may explain toxic effects seen in experiments
  in rats in vivo as well as in farm animals. After several months of consumption
  of an R-tolerant soy, the liver and pancreas of mice were affected, as highlighted
  by disturbances in sub-nuclear structure. Furthermore, this toxic effect was reproduced
  by the application of R herbicide directly to hepatocytes in culture. \n\nMore recently,
  long-term and multi-generational animal feeding trials have been performed, with
  some possibly providing evidence of safety, while others conclude on the necessity
  of further investigation because of metabolic modifications. However, in contrast
  with the study we report here, none of these previous investigations have included
  a detailed follow-up of the animals, including multiple  blood and urine sampling
  over 2 years, and none has investigated either the GM NK603 R-tolerant maize or
  Roundup. \n\nFurthermore, evaluation of long-term toxicity of herbicides is generally
  performed on mammalian physiology employing only their active principle, rather
  than the complete formulations as used in agriculture. This was the case for glyphosate,
  the declared active chemical constituent of R. It is important to note that G is
  only able to efficiently penetrate target plant organisms with the help of adjuvants
  present in the various commercially used R formulations. Even if G has shown to
  interact directly with the active site of aromatase at high levels, at low contaminating
  levels, adjuvants may be better candidates than G to explain the toxicity or endocrine
  disruptive side effects of R on human cells  and also in vivo for acute toxicity.
  In this regard, it is noteworthy that the far greater toxicity of full agricultural
  formulations compared to declared supposed active principles alone has recently
  been demonstrated also for six other major pesticides tested in vitro. When G residues
  are found in tap water, food, or feed, they arise from the total herbicide formulation
  although little data is available as to the levels of the R adjuvants in either
  the environment or food chain. Indeed, adjuvants are rarely monitored in the environment,
  but some widely used adjuvants  such as nonylphenol ethoxylates, another ethoxylated
  surfactant like POEA present in R, are widely found in rivers in England and are
  linked with disruption of wildlife sexual reproduction. Adjuvants are found in groundwater.
  The half-life of POEA  is even longer than for G  in aquatic environments. As a
  result, the necessity of studying the potential toxic effects of total chemical
  mixtures rather than single components has been strongly emphasized. On this basis,
  the regular measurement of only G or other supposed active ingredients of pesticides
  in the environment constitute at best markers of full formulation residues. Thus,
  in the study of health effects, exposure to the diluted whole formulation may be
  more representative of environmental pollution than exposure to G alone. \n\nWith
  a view to address this lack of information, we performed a 2-year detailed rat feeding
  study. Our study was designed as a chronic toxicity study and as a direct follow-up
  to a previous investigation on the same NK603 GM maize conducted by the developer
  company, Monsanto. A detailed critical analysis of the raw data of this subchronic
  90-day rat feeding study revealed statistically significant differences in multiple
  organ function parameters, especially pertaining to the liver and kidneys, between
  the GM and non-GM maize-fed group. However, Monsantos authors dismissed the findings
  as not biologically meaningful, as was also the case with another GM corn. The European
  Food Safety Authority  accepted Monsantos interpretation on NK603 maize, like in
  all other cases. \n\nOur study is the first and to date the only attempt to follow
  up Monsantos investigation and to determine whether the differences found in the
  NK603 GM maize-fed rats, especially with respect to liver and kidney function, were
  not biologically meaningful, as claimed, or whether they developed into serious
  diseases over an extended period of time. \n\nThe Monsanto authors adapted Guideline
  408 of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development  for their experimental
  design. Our study design was based on that of the Monsanto investigation in order
  to make the two experiments comparable, but we extended the period of observation
  from Monsantos 90 days to 2 years. We also used three doses of GMOs  and Roundup
  to determine treatment dose response, including any possible non-linear as well
  as linear effects. This allowed us to follow in detail the potential health effects
  and their possible origins due to the direct or indirect consequences of the genetic
  modification itself in the NK603 GM maize, or due to the R herbicide formulation
  used on the GM maize, or both. Because of recent reviews on GM foods indicating
  no specific risk of cancer, but indicating signs of hepatorenal dysfunction within
  3 months, we had no reason to adopt a carcinogenesis protocol using 50 rats per
  group. However, we prolonged to 2 years the biochemical and hematological measurements
  and measurements of disease status, as allowed, for example, in OECD protocols 453
  \ and 452. Both OECD 452 and 453 specify 20 rats per sex per group but require only
  50%  to be analyzed for biochemical and hematological parameters. Thus, these protocols
  yield data from the same number of rats as our experiment. This remains the highest
  number of rats regularly measured in a standard GM diet study, as well as for a
  full formulated pesticide at very low environmentally relevant levels. \n\nWe used
  the Sprague-Dawley strain of rat, as recommended for chronic toxicology tests by
  the National Toxicology Program in the USA, and as used by Monsanto in its 90-day
  study. This choice is also consistent with the recommendation of the OECD that for
  a chronic toxicity test, rats of the same strain should be used as in studies on
  the same substance but of shorter duration. We then also tested for the first time
  three doses  of the R-tolerant NK603 GM maize alone, the GM maize treated with R,
  and R alone at very low environmentally relevant doses, starting below the range
  of levels permitted by regulatory authorities in drinking water and in GM feed.
  \n\nOverall, our study is the first in-depth life-long toxicology study on the full
  commercial Roundup formulation and NK603 GM maize, with observations on 34 organs
  and measurement of 56 parameters analyzed at 11 time points for most organs, and
  utilizing 3 doses. We report here the major toxicological findings on multiple organ
  systems. As there was no evidence in the literature on GM food safety evaluation
  to indicate anything to the contrary, this initial investigation was designed as
  a full chronic toxicity and not a carcinogenicity study. Thus, we monitored in details
  chronologically all behavioral and anatomical abnormalities including tumors. A
  full carcinogenicity study, which usually focuses only on observing incidence and
  type of cancers, would be a rational follow-up investigation to a chronic toxicity
  study in which there is a serious suspicion of carcinogenicity. Such indications
  had not been previously reported for GM foods. \n\nOur findings show that the differences
  in multiple organ functional parameters seen from the consumption of NK603 GM maize
  for 90 days  escalated over 2 years into severe organ damage in all types of test
  diets. This included the lowest dose of R administered  of R formulation administered,
  which is well below permitted MRLs in both the USA   and European Union. Surprisingly,
  there was also a clear trend in increased tumor incidence, especially mammary tumors
  in female animals, in a number of the treatment groups. Our data highlight the inadequacy
  of 90-day feeding studies and the need to conduct long-term  investigations to evaluate
  the life-long impact of GM food consumption and exposure to complete pesticide formulations.
  \n\nStandard biochemical compositional analysis revealed no particular differences
  between the different maize types and diets, the GM and non-GM maize being classified
  as substantially equivalent, except for transgene DNA quantification. For example,
  there was no difference in total isoflavones. In addition, we also assayed for other
  specific compounds, which are not always requested for establishing substantial
  equivalence. This analysis revealed a consistent and statistically significant  decrease
  in certain phenolic acids in treatment diets, namely ferulic and caffeic acids.
  Ferulic acid was decreased in both GM maize and GM maize \\+ R diets by 16% to 30%
  in comparison to the control diet  and caffeic acid in the same groups by 21% to
  53%. \n\nAll rats were carefully monitored during the experiment for behavior, appearance,
  palpable tumors, and infections. At least ten organs per animal were weighed and
  up to 34 analyzed postmortem, at the macroscopic and/or microscopic levels. Due
  to the large quantity of data collected, it cannot all be shown in one report, but
  we present here the most important findings. There was no rejection by the animals
  of the diet with or without GM maize, nor any major difference in body weight. \n\nTable
  1. Protocol used and comparison to existing assessment and to non-mandatory regulatory
  tests\n\nThe most affected organs in males were the liver, hepatodigestive tract,
  and kidneys. Liver abnormalities such as hepatic congestions and macroscopic and
  microscopic necrotic foci were 2.5 to 5.5 times more frequent in all treatments
  than in control groups, where only two rats out of ten were affected with one abnormality
  each. For instance, there were 5 abnormalities in total in the GMO 11% group  and
  11 in the GMO 22% group. In addition, by the end of the experiment, Gamma GT hepatic
  activity was increased, particularly in the GMO + R groups, this probably being
  reflective of liver dysfunction. Furthermore, cytochrome P450 activity generally
  increased in the presence of R  according to the dose and up to 5.7 times greater
  at the highest dose. \n\nFigure 1. Anatomopathological observations in rats fed
  GMO treated or not by Roundup and effects of Roundup alone. Macroscopic  and microscopic
  \ photographs show male left kidneys and livers  and female pituitaries, in accordance
  to Table 2. The number of each animal and its treatment is specified. Macroscopic
  pale spots  and microscopic necrotic foci in liver, and marked or severe chronic
  progressive nephropathies, are illustrated. In females, pituitary adenomas  are
  shown and compared to control. Apostrophes after letters indicate organs from the
  same rat. \n\nTransmission electron microscopic observations of liver samples confirmed
  changes for all treated groups in relation to glycogen dispersion or appearance
  in lakes, increase of residual bodies and enlargement of cristae in mitochondria.
  The GM maize-fed groups either with or without R application showed a higher heterochromatin
  content and decreased nucleolar dense fibrillar components, implying a reduced level
  of mRNA and rRNA transcription. In the GMO + R group, the smooth endoplasmic reticulum
  was drastically increased and nucleoli decreased in size, becoming more compact.
  In the R alone treatment groups, similar trends were observed, with a partial resumption
  of nucleolar activity at the highest dose. \n\nFigure 2. Ultrastructure of hepatocytes

  \n\nDegenerating kidneys with turgid inflammatory areas demonstrated the increased
  incidence of marked and severe chronic progressive nephropathies, which were up
  to two fold higher in the 33% GM maize or lowest dose R treatment groups. \n\nBiochemical
  measurements of blood and urine were focused on samples taken at the 15th month
  time point, as this was the last sampling time when most animals were still alive.
  Statistical analysis of results employed OPLS-DA 2-class models built between each
  treated group per sex and controls. Only models with an explained variance R2  80%,
  and a cross-validated predictive ability Q2  60%, were used for selection of the
  discriminant variables, when their regression coefficients were significant at a
  99% confidence level. Thus, in treated females, kidney failures appeared at the
  biochemical level. Levels of Na and Cl or urea increased in urine with a concomitant
  decrease of the same ions in serum, as did the levels of P, K, and Ca. Creatinine
  and creatinine clearance decreased in urine for all treatment groups in comparison
  to female controls. In GM maize-treated males, 87% of discriminant variables were
  kidney-related, but the disrupted profiles were less obvious because of advanced
  chronic nephropathies and deaths. In summary, for all treatments and both sexes,
  76% of the discriminant variables versus controls were kidney-related. \n\nFigure

  \n\nTable 3. Percentage variation of parameters indicating kidney failures of female
  animals\n\nFurthermore, in females, the androgen/estrogen balance in serum was modified
  by GM maize and R treatments. For male animals at the highest R treatment dose,
  levels of estrogens were more than doubled. \n\nTumors are reported in line with
  the requirements of OECD chronic toxicity protocols 452 and 453, which require all
  lesions  to be reported. These findings are summarized in Figure 4. The results
  are presented in the form of real-time cumulative curves. Only the growing largest
  palpable growths  are presented. These were found to be in 95% of cases non-regressive
  tumors  and were not infectious nodules. These arose from time to time; then, most
  often disappeared and were not different from controls after bacterial analyses.
  The real tumors were recorded independently of their grade, but dependent on their
  morbidity, since non-cancerous tumors can be more lethal than those of cancerous
  nature, due to internal hemorrhaging or compression and obstruction of function
  of vital organs, or toxins or hormone secretions. These tumors progressively increased
  in size and number, but not proportionally to the treatment dose, over the course
  of the experiment. As in the case of rates of mortality, this suggests that a threshold
  in effect was reached at the lower doses. Tumor numbers were rarely equal but almost
  always more than in controls for all treated groups, often with a two- to threefold
  increase for both sexes. Tumors began to reach a large size on average 94 days before
  controls in treated females and up to 600 days earlier in two male groups fed with
  GM maize. \n\nFigure 4. Largest non-regressive tumors in rats fed GMO treated or
  not by Roundup and effects of Roundup alone. Rats were fed with NK603 GM maize  at
  three different doses  compared to the substantially equivalent closest isogenic
  non-GM maize. Roundup was administered in drinking water at three increasing doses,
  same symbols, environmental, MRL in some agricultural GMOs, and half of minimal
  agricultural levels, see Methods). The largest tumors were palpable during the experiment
  and numbered from 20 mm in diameter for males and 17.5 mm for females. Above this
  size, 95% of growths were non-regressive tumors. Summary of all tumors are shown
  in the bar histograms: black, non-regressive large tumors; white, small internal
  tumors; grey, metastases. \n\nFigure 5. Examples of female mammary tumors observed.
  Mammary tumors are evidenced  and in Roundup and GMO + Roundup groups, two representative
  rats  are compared to controls. A normal representative rat in controls is not shown,
  only a minority of them having tumors up to 700 days, in contrast with the majority
  affected in all treated groups.  The histological control. \n\nFigure 6. Mortality

  of curves and treatments are explained in the caption of Figure 4. Lifespan during
  the experiment for the control group is represented by the vertical bar  SEM. In
  bar histograms, the causes of mortality before the grey area are detailed in comparison
  to the controls. In black are the necessary euthanasia because of suffering in accordance
  with ethical rules ; and in hatched areas, spontaneous mortality. \n\nIn female
  animals, the largest tumors were in total five times more frequent than in males
  after 2 years, with 93% of these being mammary tumors. Adenomas, fibroadenomas,
  and carcinomas were deleterious to health due to their very large size  rather than
  the grade of the tumor itself. Large tumor size caused impediments to either breathing
  or digestion and nutrition because of their thoracic or abdominal location and also
  resulted in hemorrhaging. In addition, one metastatic ovarian cystadenocarcinoma
  and two skin tumors were identified. Metastases were observed in only two cases;
  one in a group fed with 11% GM maize and another in the highest dose of R treatment
  group. \n\nUp to 14 months, no animals in the control groups showed any signs of
  palpable tumors, whilst 10% to 30% of treated females per group developed tumors,
  with the exception of one group. By the beginning of the 24th month, 50% to 80%
  of female animals had developed tumors in all treatment groups, with up to three
  tumors per animal, whereas only 30% of controls were affected. A summary of all
  mammary tumors at the end of the experiment, independent of size, is presented in
  Table 2. The same trend was observed in the groups receiving R in their drinking
  water. The R treatment groups showed the greatest rates of tumor incidence, with
  80% of animals affected, in each group. Using a non-parametric multiple comparison
  analysis, mammary tumor incidence was significantly increased at the lowest dose
  of R compared to controls. All females except one  presented in addition mammary
  hypertrophies and in some cases hyperplasia with atypia. \n\nThe second most affected
  organ in females was the pituitary gland, in general around two times more than
  in controls for most treatments. Again, at this level of examination, adenomas and/or
  hyperplasias and hypertrophies were noticed. For all R treatment groups, 70% to
  80% of animals presented 1.4 to 2.4 times more abnormalities in this organ than
  controls. \n\nThe large palpable tumors in males  were by the end of the experimental
  period on average twice as frequent as in controls, in which only one skin fibroma
  appeared during the 23rd month. At the end of the experiment, internal non-palpable
  tumors were added, and their sums were lower in males than in females. They were
  not significantly different from controls, although slightly increased in females.
  \n\nThe rates of mortality in the various control and treatment groups are shown
  as raw data in Figure 6. Control male animals survived on average 624  21 days,
  whilst females lived for 701  20 days during the experiment, plus in each case,
  a 5-week starting age at reception of animals and a 3-week housing stabilization
  period. After mean survival time had elapsed, any deaths that occurred were considered
  to be largely due to aging. Before this period, 30% control males  and 20% females
  \ died spontaneously, while up to 50% males and 70% females died in some groups
  on diets containing the GM maize. However, the rate of mortality was not proportional
  to the treatment dose, reaching a threshold at the lowest  or intermediate  amounts
  of GM maize in the equilibrated diet, with or without the R application on the crop.
  It is noteworthy that the first two male rats that died in both GM maize-treated
  groups had to be euthanized due to Wilms kidney tumors that had grown by this time
  to over 25% of body weight. This was approximately a year before the first control
  animal died. The first female death occurred in the 22% GM maize feeding group and
  resulted from a mammary fibroadenoma 246 days before the first control female death.
  The maximum difference in males was five times more deaths occurring by the 17th
  month in the group consuming 11% GM maize and in females six times greater mortality
  by the 21st month on the 22% GM maize diet with and without R. In the female cohorts,
  there were two to three times more deaths in all treated groups compared with controls
  by the end of the experiment and deaths occurred earlier in general. Females were
  more sensitive to the presence of R in drinking water than males, as evidenced by
  a shorter lifespan. The general causes of death represented in histogram format
  within each of the panels in Figure 6, are linked mostly to mammary tumors in females
  and to problems in other organ systems in males. \n\nAdditional file 2. List of
  blood and urine paramaters with sampling and unit detail\n\nThis report describes
  the first long-term  rodent  feeding study investigating possible toxic effects
  arising from consumption of an R-tolerant GM maize  and a complete commercial formulation
  of R herbicide. The aims of this investigation were essentially twofold. First,
  to evaluate whether the signs of toxicity, especially with respect to liver and
  kidney functions, seen after 90 days consumption of a diet containing NK603 R-tolerant
  GM maize  escalated into serious ill health or dissipated over an extended period
  of time. Second, to determine if low doses of full commercial R formulation at permitted
  levels were still toxic, as indicated by our previous in vitro studies. The previous
  toxicity study with NK603 maize employed only this GM crop that had been sprayed
  with R during cultivation. However, in our study presented here, in addition to
  extending the treatment period from 90 days to 2 years and in order to better ascertain
  the source of any ill health observed, we included additional test feeding groups.
  These consisted of NK603 maize grown without as well as with R application and R
  alone administered via drinking water. Furthermore, we used three levels of dosing
  in all cases rather than the two previously used, in order to highlight any dose
  response effects of a given treatment. It is also important to note that our study
  is the first to conduct blood, urine, and organ analyses from animals treated with
  the complete agricultural formulation of R and not just G alone, as measured by
  the manufacturer. \n\nOur data show that the signs of liver and kidney toxicity
  seen at 90 days from the consumption of NK603 GM maize  do indeed escalate into
  severe disease over an extended period. Furthermore, similar negative health effects
  were observed in all treatment groups. \n\nWhat is also evident from our data is
  that ill effects were not proportional to the dose of either the NK603 GM maize
  \ R or R alone. This suggests that the observed disease may result from endocrine
  disruptive effects, which are known to be non-monotonic. Similar degrees of pathological
  symptoms occurred from the lowest to the highest doses, suggesting a threshold effect.
  This corresponds to levels likely to arise from consumption or environmental exposure,
  such as either 11% GM maize in food, or 50 ng/L G equivalent of R-formulation, a
  level which can be found in some contaminated drinking tap waters and which falls
  within authorized limits. \n\nDeath in male rats was mostly due to the development
  of severe hepatorenal insufficiencies, confirming the first signs of toxicity observed
  in 90-day feeding trials with NK603 GM maize. In females, kidney ion leakage was
  evident at a biochemical level at month 15, when severe nephropathies were observed
  in dead male animals at postmortem, at the anatomopathological level. Early signs
  of toxicity at month 3 in kidney and liver were also observed for 19 edible GM crops
  containing pesticide residues. It is known that only elderly male rats are sensitive
  to chronic progressive nephropathies. Therefore, the disturbed kidney functional
  parameters may have been induced by the reduced levels of phenolic acids in the
  GM maize feed used in our study, since caffeic and ferulic acids are beneficial
  to the kidney as they prevent oxidative stress. This possibility is consistent with
  our previous observation that plant extracts containing ferulic and caffeic acids
  were able to promote detoxification of human embryonic kidney cells after culture
  in the presence of R. It is thus possible that NK603 GM maize consumption, with
  its reduced levels of these compounds, may have provoked the early aging of the
  kidney physiology, similarly to R exposure causing oxidative stress. Disturbances
  in global patterns of gene expression leading to disease via epigenetic effects
  cannot be excluded, since it has been demonstrated that numerous pesticides can
  cause changes in DNA methylation and histone modification, thereby altering chromatin
  compaction and thus gene expression profiles. \n\nDisturbances that we found to
  occur in the male liver are characteristic of chronic toxicity, confirmed by alterations
  in biochemical liver and kidney function parameters. The observation that liver
  function in female animals was less negatively affected may be due to the known
  protection from oxidative stress conferred by estrogen. Estrogen can induce expression
  of genes such as superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase via the MAP kinase-NF-kB
  signaling pathway, thus providing an antioxidant effect. Furthermore, liver enzymes
  have been clearly demonstrated as sex-specific in their expression patterns, including
  in a 90-day rat feeding trial of NK603 GM maize. However, in a long-term study,
  evidence of early liver aging was observed in female mice fed with R-tolerant GM
  soy. In the present investigation, deeper analysis at an ultrastructural level revealed
  evidence of impediments in transcription and other defects in cell nuclear structure
  that were comparable in both sexes and dose-dependent in hepatocytes in all treatments.
  This is consistent with the well-documented toxic effect of very low dilutions of
  R on apoptosis, mitochondrial function, and cell membrane degradation, inducing
  necrosis of hepatocytes, and in other cell lines. \n\nThe disruptions of at least
  the estrogen-related pathways and/or enhancement of oxidative stress by all treatments
  need further confirmation. This can be addressed through the application of transcriptomic,
  proteomic, and metabolomic methods to analyze the molecular profile of kidneys and
  livers, as well as the GM NK603 maize. Other possible causes of observed pathogenic
  effects may be due to disturbed gene expression resulting from the transgene insertional,
  general mutagenic, or metabolic effects  as has been shown for MON810 GM maize.
  A consequent disruption of general metabolism in the GMO cannot be excluded, which
  could lead, for example, to the production of other potentially active compounds
  such as miRNAs  or leukotoxin diols. \n\nThe lifespan of the control group of animals
  corresponded to the mean for the strain of rat used, but as is frequently the case
  with most mammals, including humans, males on average died before females, except
  for some female treatment groups. All treatments in both sexes enhanced large tumor
  incidence by two- to threefold in comparison to our controls and also the number
  of mammary tumors in comparison to the Harlan Sprague-Dawley strain  and overall
  around threefold in comparison to the largest study with 1,329 Sprague-Dawley female
  rats. This indicates that the use of historical data to compare our tumor numbers
  is not relevant, first, since we studied the difference with concurrent controls
  chronologically, and second, since the diets of historical reference animals may
  have been contaminated with several non-monitored compounds including GMOs and pesticides
  at levels used in our treatments. In our study, the tumors also developed considerably
  faster than in controls, even though the majority of tumors were observed after
  18 months. The first large detectable tumors occurred at 4 and 7 months into the
  study in males and females, respectively, further underlining the inadequacy of
  the standard 90-day feeding trials for evaluating GM crop and food toxicity. Future
  studies employing larger cohorts of animals providing appropriate statistical power
  are required to confirm or refute the clear trend in increased tumor incidence and
  mortality rates seen with some of the treatments tested in this study. As already
  stated, our study was not designed as a carcinogenicity study that would have required
  according to OECD the use of 50 rats per sex per group. However, we wish to emphasize
  that the need for more rats to provide sufficient statistical power may be biased
  by the presence of contaminants in the diets used in gathering historical control
  data, increasing artificially the background of tumors, which would inappropriately
  be called in this case spontaneous or due to the genetic strain. For instance, toxic,
  hormonal disrupting or carcinogenic levels of pesticides, PCBs, plasticizers, dioxins,
  or heavy metals may contaminate the diets or drinking water used for the establishment
  of spontaneous tumors in historical data. \n\nIn females, induced euthanasia due
  to suffering and deaths corresponded mostly to the development of large mammary
  tumors. This was observed independently of the cancer grade but according to impact
  on morbidity. These appeared to be related to the various treatments when compared
  to the control groups. These tumors are generally known to be mostly estrogen-dependent.
  We observed a strikingly marked induction of mammary tumors in groups administered
  R alone, even at the very lowest dose. At this concentration in vitro, G alone is
  known to induce human breast cancer cell growth via estrogen receptors. In addition,
  R with adjuvants has been shown to disrupt aromatase, which synthesizes estrogen,
  and to interfere with estrogen and androgen receptors in cells. Furthermore, R appears
  to be a sex endocrine disruptor in vivo in males. Sex steroid levels were also modified
  in treated rats in our study. These hormone-dependent phenomena are confirmed by
  enhanced pituitary dysfunction in treated females. An estrogen-modified feedback
  mechanism may act at this level. The similar pathological profiles provoked by the
  GM maize + R diet may thus be explained at least in part by R residues present in
  this feed. In this regard, it is noteworthy that the medium dose of the R treatment
  tested  corresponds to acceptable residue levels of this pesticide in some edible
  GMOs. \n\nInterestingly and perhaps surprisingly, in the groups of animals fed with
  the NK603 GM maize without R application, similar effects with respect to enhanced
  tumor incidence and mortality rates were observed. For instance, comparing the 11%
  GMO-treated female group to the controls, the assumption that the tumors are equally
  distributed is rejected with a level of significance of 0.54% with the Westlake
  exceedance test. The classical tests of Kolmogorov-Smirnov  and Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney
  reach  values of significance, which are respectively of 1.40% and 2.62%. \n\nA
  possible explanation for this finding is the production of specific compound in
  the GM feed that are either directly toxic and/or cause the inhibition of pathways,
  which in turn generates toxic effects. This is despite the fact that the variety
  of GM maize used in this study was judged by industry and regulators as being substantially
  equivalent to the corresponding non-GM closest isogenic line. As the total chemical
  composition of the GM maize has not been measured in detail, the use of substantial
  equivalence as a concept in risk assessment is insufficient to highlight potential
  unknown toxins and therefore cannot replace long-term animal feeding trials for
  GMOs. \n\nA cause of the ill effects resulting from NK603 GM maize alone observed
  in this study could be the fact that it is engineered to overexpress a modified
  version of the Agrobacterium tumefaciens 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase,
  which confers R tolerance. The modified EPSPS is not inhibited by G, in contrast
  to the wild-type enzyme in the crop. This enzyme is known to drive the first step
  of aromatic amino acid biosynthesis in the plant shikimate pathway. In addition,
  estrogenic isoflavones and their glycosides are also products of this pathway. A
  limited compositional analysis showed that these biochemical pathways were not disturbed
  in the GM maize used in our study. However, our analysis did reveal that the levels
  of caffeic and ferulic acids in the GM diet, which are also secondary metabolites
  of the plant shikimate pathway, but not always measured in regulatory tests, were
  significantly reduced. This may lower their protective effects against carcinogenesis
  and mammalian tumor formation. Moreover, these phenolic acids, and in particular
  ferulic acid, may modulate estrogen receptors or the estrogenic pathway in mammalian
  cells. This does not exclude the possibility of the action of other unknown metabolites.
  This explanation also corresponds to the fact that the observed effects of NK603
  GM maize and R were not additive but reached a threshold. This implies that both
  the NK603 maize and R may cause hormonal disturbances in the same biochemical and
  physiological pathways. \n\nIn conclusion, the consumption of NK603 GM maize with
  or without R application or R alone gave similar pathologies in male and female
  rats fed over a 2-year period. It was previously known that G consumption in water
  above authorized limits may provoke hepatic and kidney failure. The results of the
  study presented here clearly indicate that lower levels of complete agricultural
  G herbicide formulations, at concentrations well below officially set safety limits,
  can induce severe hormone-dependent mammary, hepatic, and kidney disturbances. Similarly,
  disruption of biosynthetic pathways that may result from overexpression of the EPSPS
  transgene in the GM NK603 maize can give rise to comparable pathologies that may
  be linked to abnormal or unbalanced phenolic acid metabolites or related compounds.
  Other mutagenic and metabolic effects of the edible GMO cannot be excluded. This
  will be the subject of future studies, including analyses of transgene, G and other
  R residue presence in rat tissues. Reproductive and multigenerational studies will
  also provide novel insight into these problems. This study represents the first
  detailed documentation of long-term deleterious effects arising from consumption
  of a GMO, specifically a R-tolerant maize, and of R, the most widely used herbicide
  worldwide. \n\nTaken together, the significant biochemical disturbances and physiological
  failures documented in this work reveal the pathological effects of these GMO and
  R treatments in both sexes, with different amplitudes. They also show that the conclusion
  of the Monsanto authors  that the initial indications of organ toxicity found in
  their 90-day experiment were not biologically meaningful is not justifiable. \n\nWe
  propose that agricultural edible GMOs and complete pesticide formulations must be
  evaluated thoroughly in long-term studies to measure their potential toxic effects.
  \n\nThe experimental protocol was conducted in an animal care unit authorized by
  the French Ministries of Agriculture and Research. Animal experiments were performed
  according to ethical guidelines of animal experimentations, including the necessary
  observations of all tumors, in line with the requirements for a long-term toxicological
  study, up to a size where euthanasia on ethical grounds was necessary. \n\nConcerning
  the cultivation of the maize used in this study, no specific permits were required.
  This is because the maize was grown  in Canada, where it is authorized for unconfined
  release into the environment and for use as a livestock feed by the Canadian Food
  Inspection Agency. We confirm that the cultivation did not involve endangered or
  protected species. The GM maize was authorized for import and consumption into the
  European Union. \n\nThe varieties of maize used in this study were the DKC 2678
  R-tolerant NK603, and its nearest isogenic non-transgenic control DKC 2675. These
  two types of maize were grown under similar normal conditions, in the same location,
  spaced at sufficient distance to avoid cross-contamination. The genetic nature,
  as well as the purity of the GM seeds and harvested material, was confirmed by qPCR
  analysis of DNA samples. One field of NK603 was treated with R at 3 L ha1, and another
  field of NK603 was not treated with R. Corn cobs were harvested when the moisture
  content was less than 30% and were dried at a temperature below 30C. From these
  three cultivations of maize, laboratory rat chow was made based on the standard
  diet A04. The dry rat feed was made to contain 11%, 22%, or 33% of GM maize, cultivated
  either with or without R, or 33% of the non-transgenic control line. The concentrations
  of the transgene were confirmed in the three doses of each diet by qPCR. All feed
  formulations consisted of balanced diets, chemically measured as substantially equivalent
  except for the transgene, with no contaminating pesticides over standard limits.
  All secondary metabolites cannot be known and measured in the composition. However,
  we measured isoflavones and phenolic acids including ferulic acid by standard HPLC-UV.
  All reagents used were of analytical grade. The herbicide diluted in the drinking
  water was the commercial formulation of R. Herbicide levels were assessed by G measurements
  in the different dilutions by mass spectrometry. \n\nVirgin albino Sprague-Dawley
  rats at 5 weeks of age were obtained from Harlan. All animals were kept in polycarbonate
  cages  with two animals of the same sex per cage. The litter  was replaced twice
  weekly. The animals were maintained at 22  3C under controlled humidity  and air
  purity with a 12 h-light/dark cycle, with free access to food and water. The location
  of each cage within the experimental room was regularly changed. This 2-year life-long
  experiment was conducted in a Good Laboratory Practice  accredited laboratory according
  to OECD guidelines. After 20 days of acclimatization, 100 male and 100 female animals
  were randomly assigned on a weight basis into ten equivalent groups. For each sex,
  one control group had access to plain water and standard diet from the closest isogenic
  non-transgenic maize control; six groups were fed with 11%, 22%, and 33% of GM NK603
  maize either treated or not treated with R. The final three groups were fed with
  the control diet and had access to water supplemented with respectively 1.1  108%
  of R, 0.09% of R, and 0.5% of R. This was changed weekly. Twice-weekly monitoring
  allowed careful observation and palpation of animals, recording of clinical signs,
  measurement of any tumors, food and water consumption, and individual body weights.
  \n\nAnimals were sacrificed during the course of the study only if necessary because
  of suffering according to ethical rules  and at the end of the study by exsanguination
  under isoflurane anesthesia. In each case, detailed observations and anatomopathology
  was performed and the following organs were collected: brain, colon, heart, kidneys,
  liver, lungs, ovaries, spleen, testes, adrenals, epididymis, prostate, thymus, uterus,
  aorta, bladder, bone, duodenum, esophagus, eyes, ileum, jejunum, lymph nodes, lymphoreticular
  system, mammary glands, pancreas, parathyroid glands, Peyers patches, pituitary,
  salivary glands, sciatic nerve, skin, spinal cord, stomach, thyroid, and trachea.
  The first 14 organs  were weighted, plus any tumors that arose. The first nine were
  divided into two parts and one half was immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen/carbonic
  ice. The remaining parts including other organs were rinsed in PBS and stored in
  4% formalin before anatomopathological study. These samples were used for further
  paraffin-embedding, slides, and HES histological staining. For transmission electron
  microscopy, the kidneys, livers, and tumors were cut into 1 mm3 fragments. Samples
  were fixed in pre-chilled 2% paraformaldehyde/2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M PBS pH
  7.4 at 4C for 3 h and processed as previously described. \n\nBlood samples were
  collected from the tail vein of each rat under short isoflurane anesthesia before
  treatment and after 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, and 24 months: 11 measurements
  were obtained for each animal alive at 2 years. It was first demonstrated that anesthesia
  did not impact animal health. Two aliquots of plasma and serum were prepared and
  stored at 80C. Then, 31 parameters were assessed  according to standard methods
  including hematology and coagulation parameters, albumin, globulin, total protein
  concentration, creatinine, urea, calcium, sodium, potassium, chloride, inorganic
  phosphorus, triglycerides, glucose, total cholesterol, alanine aminotransferase,
  aspartate aminotransferase, gamma glutamyl-transferase, estradiol, and testosterone.
  In addition, at months 12 and 24, the C-reactive protein was assayed. Urine samples
  were collected similarly 11 times, over 24 h in individual metabolic cages, and
  16 parameters were quantified including creatinine, phosphorus, potassium, chloride,
  sodium, calcium, pH, and clearance. Liver samples taken at the end made it possible
  to perform assays of CYP1A1, 1A2, 3A4, 2C9 activities in S9 fractions, with glutathione
  S-transferase and gamma-GT. \n\nIn this study, multivariate analyses were more appropriate
  than pairwise comparisons between groups because the parameters were very numerous,
  with samples of ten individuals. Kaplan-Meyer comparisons, for instance, were not
  used because these are better adapted to epidemiological studies. Differences in
  the numbers of mammary tumors were studied by a non-parametric multiple comparisons
  Kruskal-Wallis test, followed by a post hoc Dunns test with the GraphPad Prism 5
  software. \n\nBiochemical data were treated by multivariate analysis with the SIMCA-P
  \ software. The use of chemometrics tools, for example, principal component analysis,
  partial least squares to latent structures, and orthogonal PLS, are robust methods
  for modeling, analyzing, and interpreting complex chemical and biological data.
  OPLS is a recent modification of the PLS method. PLS is a regression method used
  in order to find the relationship between two data tables referred to as X and Y.
  PLS regression  analysis consists in calculating by means of successive iterations,
  linear combinations of the measured X-variables. These linear combinations of X-variables
  give PLS components. A PLS component can be thought of as a new variable - a latent
  variable - reflecting the information in the original X-variables that is of relevance
  for modeling and predicting the response Y-variable by means of the maximization
  of the square of covariance ). The number of components is determined by cross validation.
  SIMCA software uses the nonlinear iterative partial least squares algorithm  for
  the PLS regression. Orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis  was
  used in this study. \n\nThe purpose of discriminant analysis is to find a model
  that separates groups of observations on the basis of their X variables. The X matrix
  consists of the biochemical data. The Y matrix contains dummy variables which describe
  the group membership of each observation. Binary variables are used in order to
  encode a group identity. Discriminant analysis finds a discriminant plan in which
  the projected observations are well separated according to each group. The objective
  of OPLS is to divide the systematic variation in the X-block into two model parts,
  one linearly related to Y, and the other one unrelated  to Y. Components related
  to Y are called predictive, and those unrelated to Y are called orthogonal. This
  partitioning of the X data results in improved model transparency and interpretability.
  Prior to analysis, variables were mean-centered and unit variance scaled. \n\nThe

  regulatory assessments for GMOs and pesticides, they are independent from companies
