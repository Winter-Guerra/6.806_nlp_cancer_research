  The antioxidant properties and total phenolic of different extracting solvents of
  thyme, sage, and marjoram were examined using the stable 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl-hydrate  free
  radical scavenging method and Folin-Ciocalteu method, respectively. Methanol exhibited
  the highest extraction ability for such phenolic compound, where the total phenols
  were 8.10, 5.95, and 5.20  for thyme, sage, and marjoram, respectively and also
  exhibited the strongest antioxidant capacity. On the basis of the results obtained,
  thyme, sage, and marjoram have a potential use as natural antioxidants due to their
  significant antioxidant activity. HPLC analysis of methanolic extract showed the
  presence of: rosmarenic acid, methyl rosmarenate, caffeic acid, cinnamic acid, chlorogenic
  acid and quinic acid as phenolic acids, besides some flavonoids such as ferulic
  acid, apigenin, luteolin and quercetin. The results demonstrated that thyme methanol
  extract possessed the best antioxidative activity, which were better than those
  of other plants, -tocopherol and BHA.'
