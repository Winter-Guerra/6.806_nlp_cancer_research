  6-MethylsulfinylHexyl Isothiocyanate Induces Apoptosis in Human Breast Cancer by
  Possible Involvement of .md
text: '


  6-hexyl isothiocyanate  is a bioactive ingredient of wasabi, which is a popular
  spice in Japan. 6-MSITC has been reported to inhibit the proliferation of breast
  cancer and melanoma cell lines. We inoculated 30 female Balb-nu/nu mice with MDA-MB-231
  or -453 cells, and orally administered varying concentrations of 6-MSITC for 12
  days following tumor growth. The tumor volumes and tumor weights from mice inoculated
  with MDA-MB-231 cells, and the tumor volumes of MDA-MB-453 cells were significantly
  inhibited by 6-MSITC on Days 9 and 11 after drug administration. DNA fragmentation,
  DNA ladder, and caspase 3/7 activity performed in vitro revealed that 6-MSITC induced
  apoptosis of MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-453, and MCF-7 cells. Furthermore, nuclear factor-B  expression
  in the nuclei and phosphorylation of inhibitor B  was downregulated by 6-MSITC in
  a concentration-dependent manner; however, this activity was not observed in MCF-7
  cells. Moreover, this downregulation of phosphorylated IB by 6-MSITC in MDA-MB-231
  and -453 cells supports its inhibitory effects on NF-B activity. The expression
  of phosphorylated AKT  reduced by 6-MSITC was confirmed in MDA-MB-231 cells. Thus,
  we conclude that 6-MITC promotes apoptosis of breast cancer cells by inhibiting
  NF-kB and therefore releasing its control of the PI3K/AKT pathway.'
