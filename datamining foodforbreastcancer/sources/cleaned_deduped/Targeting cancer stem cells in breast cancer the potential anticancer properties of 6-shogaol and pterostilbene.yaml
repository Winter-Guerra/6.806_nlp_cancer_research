  cancer stem cells in breast cancer the potential anticancer properties of 6-shogaol
  and pterostilbene.md
text: '


  Breast cancer stem cells  constitute a small fraction of the primary tumor that
  can self-renew and become a drug-resistant cell population, thus limiting the treatment
  effects of chemotherapeutic drugs. The present study evaluated the cytotoxic effects
  of five phytochemicals including 6-gingerol, 6-shogaol, 5-hydroxy-3,6,7,8,3,4-hexamethoxyflavone,
  nobiletin, and pterostilbene  on MCF-7 breast cancer cells and BCSCs. The results
  showed that 6-G, 6-S, and PTE selectively killed BCSCs and had high sensitivity
  for BCSCs isolated from MCF-7 cells that expressed the surface antigen CD44+/CD24.
  6-S and PTE induced cell necrosis phenomena such as membrane injury and bleb formation
  in BCSCs and inhibited mammosphere formation. In addition, 6-S and PTE increased
  the sensitivity of isolated BCSCs to chemotherapeutic drugs and significantly increased
  the anticancer activity of paclitaxel. Analysis of the underlying mechanism showed
  that 6-S and PTE decreased the expression of the surface antigen CD44 on BCSCs and
  promoted -catenin phosphorylation through the inhibition of hedgehog/Akt/GSK3 signaling,
  thus decreasing the protein expression of downstream c-Myc and cyclin D1 and reducing
  BCSC stemness.


  The fifth most common cause of cancer death in the world, breast cancer is highly
  metastatic, easy to relapse, and difficult to cure, and it has a high mortality
  rate. It was first proposed by scholars in 1997 that a small portion of cancer cells
  could replicate in vitro to form colonies; these cells were called cancer stem cells.
  CSCs form tumors in immunodeficient mice at a density of 0.00010.1% of that required
  for general tumor cells; therefore, they are also known as tumorigenic cells or
  tumor-forming cells. Currently, the evolvement of breast cancer stem cells  into
  a drug-resistant cell population and their high metastatic capability have been
  considered the major reasons for breast cancer recurrence, which limits the effects
  of clinical treatment for breast cancer.


  The cancer stem cell hypothesis proposes that CSCs are the key factors for the promotion
  of abnormal proliferation, invasion, metastasis, drug resistance, and recurrence
  of tumor cells. Using acute myeloid leukemia as an example, leukemia stem cells,
  which also express the CD34+/CD38 surface antigen, similar to hematopoietic stem
  cells, have the feature of self-renewal and highly induce tumor formation in nonobese
  diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency  mice. Subsequent studies gradually confirmed
  the presence of CSCs in many types of tumors, such as breast cancer, brain cancer,
  lung cancer, prostate cancer, colon cancer, melanoma, and pancreatic cancer.


  A CSC can undergo asymmetric cell division to produce a differentiated daughter
  cell and a CSC; this biological feature can not only preserve the CSC stemness but
  also increase their differentiated cell populations. On this basis, it is known
  that CSCs can produce cancer cells that have gene polymorphisms to form tumors,
  which are also resistant to chemotherapeutic drugs. In addition, a branch of the
  population of CSCs, known as metastatic CSCs, can secrete pro-metastasis niche factors
  in the tumor microenvironment to promote the metastatic seeding of mCSCs in blood
  vessels, which plays important roles in the process of tumor metastasis. Studies
  have shown that chemotherapeutic drugs reactivate signals to stimulate cancer cell
  metastasis. Previous studies have also shown that the self-renewal ability of CSCs
  is associated with the regulatory pathways of hedgehog, Notch, PI3K/Akt, and Wnt/-catenin.
  These signaling pathways might also participate in the maintenance of the stemness
  of CD44+/CD24/low BCSCs.


  In vitro cultured CSCs aggregate into floating clumps to facilitate attachment and
  differentiation; these clumps are called spheroids and are specifically called mammospheres
  with regard to BCSCs. After long-term culture, mammospheres produce a functional
  mammary tree structure; similar findings have also been discovered in neurospheres
  and prostatospheres. Currently, there are many isolation methods for CSCs. For example,
  cell populations can be isolated from tumor tissues, cells can be collected after
  labeling the cell surface antigens CD44+ or CD133+, and CSCs that have survived
  chemotherapeutic drug treatment can be obtained using their drug-resistance feature.
  In addition, using the induction of epithelia to mesenchymal transition  in tumor
  cells, the specific tumor cell population that exhibits stemness after dedifferentiation
  can be obtained.


  Gupta et al. showed that salinomycin selectively kills CSCs and effectively inhibits
  BCSC survival and mammosphere formation. These results showed that specific inhibition
  of mammosphere formation might be regarded as an effective measure for breast cancer
  treatment. Because therapeutic drugs, such as paclitaxel, doxorubicin, docetaxel,
  and cyclophosphamide, are already used to target breast cancer, development of an
  adjuvant therapy to target CSCs from natural products that are highly safe, do not
  have side effects, and can strengthen the effect of chemotherapeutic drugs should
  be a feasible strategy for breast cancer treatment.


  6-Gingerol  is the most abundant polyphenolic compound in ginger ; after dehydration,
  6-G becomes 6-shogaol, which has higher physiological activities. 6-S is the source
  of the pungent constituent of ginger; it can attenuate neuroinflammation and cognitive
  deficits and induce colon cancer cell apoptosis through the induction of reactive
  oxygen species  production and activation of the caspase pathway. Weng et al. showed
  that 6-S and 6-G inhibit the invasive characteristics of liver cancer cells. Pterostilbene,
  which is extensively present in blueberries and grapes, is a dimethylated analogue
  of resveratrol and a natural antibacterial substance. Simoni et al. confirmed that
  PTE can effectively induce apoptosis in HL-60 leukemia cells and can inhibit the
  invasion and metastasis functions of HepG2 liver cancer cells through the inhibition
  of the expression of NF-B and AP-1 transcriptional factors and MMP-9. Nobiletin  and
  5-hydroxy-3,6,7,8,3,4-hexamethoxyflavone  are both flavonoids in citrus fruits;
  previous studies have confirmed that they have antitumor potentials, such as the
  inhibition of tumor cell invasion and promotion of apoptosis.


  Modern chemotherapies are designed to prevent the local recurrences of primary tumors
  and the distant metastases of tumor cells. However, the effective doses of many
  chemotherapeutics cause severe side effects. There is considerable interest in the
  discovery and investigation of more potent anticancer stemness compounds to prevent
  and delay cancer recurrence. Important attributes of an ideal inhibitor would be
  easy obtainment, absorption, and excretion, little or none toxicity, and the absence
  of serious side effects. Naturally occurring polyphenols such as 6-G, 6-S, 5-HF,
  NOL, and PTE should, therefore, be ideal candidates for reducing cancer stemness.
  Although previous paper have described the antitumor activities of the above phytochemicals,
  no studies have been made of their selective cytotoxic effects on CSCs and their
  parental cancer cells. In the field of CSC studies, BCSCs were discovered early
  and could be identified using cell surface antigens. Therefore, there are detailed
  reports on the isolation and identification of CSCs that can be referenced. On the
  basis of these reports, this study aimed to investigate the effects of 6-S, 6-G,
  PTE, NOL, and 5-HF on BCSC proliferation and clarify the underlying molecular mechanisms.


  6-G and 6-S were isolated and purified as previously described. 5-HF and NOL were
  synthesized according to the previous method. PTE was synthesized according to the
  method reported by Pettit et al. Epidermal growth factor, basic fibroblast growth
  factor, human leukemia inhibitory factor, insulin-transferrin-sodium selenite supplement,
  3--2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, fish gelatin, anti--actin antibody, HEPES buffer,
  Tween-20, and sodium bicarbonate were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co.. The protein
  assay kit and Tris-base were obtained from Bio-Rad. B27 supplement, Dulbeccos modified
  Eagles medium/Hams F-12  medium, Roswell Park Memorial Institute  1640 medium, fetal
  bovine serum, trypsin-EDTA, propidium iodide, and penicillinstreptomycin were purchased
  from Invitrogen. The nuclear/cytosol fractionation kit was purchased from BioVision.
  Dimethyl sulfoxide  was obtained from Merck Co.. Anti-phospho-GSK3, anti-notch,
  anti-STAT3, anti-phospho-STAT3, anti-survivin, and anti-Sonic-hedgehog antibodies
  were obtained from Millipore. Anti--catenin, anti-phospho--catenin, anti-mTOR, anti-phospho-mTOR,
  anti-Akt, and anti-phospho-Akt  antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology.
  Anti-cyclin D1, anti-c-Myc, and anti-GSK3 antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz
  Biotechnology Inc.. Anti-CD44-PE and anti-CD24-FITC antibodies were obtained from
  Biolegend, and the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody
  was obtained from Bethyl Laboratories Inc..


  The MCF-7 human breast adenocarcinoma cell line was obtained from the Bioresource
  Collection and Research Center  and was cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% v/v
  FBS in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. The medium was changed three
  times per week. The MCF-7 cells were estrogen receptor positive and characterized
  as having a low metastatic phenotype.


  MCF-7 cells were detached and resuspended in PBS containing 1% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.
  Combinations of fluorochrome-conjugated monoclonal antibodies against human CD44  and
  CD24  or their respective isotype controls were added to the cell suspension at
  concentrations recommended by the manufacturer and incubated at 4 C in the dark
  for 30 min. Cells were analyzed and sorted on an FACSAria Cell Sorter unit, using
  PI as a viable stain. BCSCs were gated on low side scatter, low-to-moderate forward
  scatter, and low PI. The CD44+/CD24/low phenotype was used to identify and isolate
  BCSCs, according to a previous study. For data acquisition, at least 10000 events
  were analyzed. The purity and viability of isolated cells were routinely &gt;98%,
  as determined by trypan blue dye exclusion. The sorted BCSCs were cultured in stem
  cell medium  without FBS.


  Sorted cells were plated on ultralow attachment plates  at a density of 20000 viable
  cells per milliliter and a density of 1000 cells per milliliter for subsequent passages.
  Cells were grown in SCM as described above. Mammospheres were collected by gentle
  centrifugation  after 710 days and were dissociated enzymatically  and mechanically,
  using a fire-polished Pasteur pipet. The cells obtained from dissociation were passed
  through a 40 m sieve and analyzed microscopically for single cellularity. Cells
  plated at low densities  were grown in conditioned medium from high-density sorted
  cultures in suspension.


  BCSCs were harvested and seeded in six-well plates  coated with 0.6% agarose. Anchorage-independent
  growth was assessed after incubation for 1014 days in culture medium with or without
  the tested phytochemicals, which was replaced every 2 days. The plates were stained
  with 0.005% crystal violet, and the colonies were counted manually under a microscope
  and imaged.


  BCSCs were treated with 6-S or PTE for 424 h. After treatment, the cell lysates
  and nuclear fractions were prepared using a nuclear/cytosol fractionation kit. The
  protein concentrations of the cell lysate and nuclear fractions were estimated with
  the Bio-Rad DC protein assay using BSA as the standard. Total proteins  were separated
  by SDS-PAGE using a 10% polyacrylamide gel and then transferred onto a nitrocellulose
  membrane. The membrane was blocked with 1% fish gelatin in PBS with 0.05% Tween
  20  for 1 h. The membranes were then incubated with primary antibodies  at 4 C overnight,
  followed by incubation with a horseradish peroxide-linked secondary antibody. The
  protein bands were visualized using the ChemiLucent ECL Detection System  and the
  Biospectrum AC Imaging System. The expression levels of the proteins of interest
  were normalized to the expression of -actin. The intensity of the chemiluminescence
  signal was quantified using the UVP VisionWorksLS Image Acquisition and Analysis
  software.


  Each experiment was performed in triplicate. The results are expressed as the mean  SD.
  The statistical analyses were performed using SAS software, and the variances were
  assessed using ANOVAs. Significant differences  between the means were identified
  by Duncans multiple-range tests.


  This study selected five phytochemicals, 6-G, 6-S, 5-HF, NOL, and PTE, to evaluate
  with regard to their cytotoxicity on MCF-7 BCSCs  and MCF-7 breast cancer cells
  using the trypan blue assay. The results showed that, of the above five phytochemicals
  tested at doses of 0.175 M, the IC50 values of 6-G, 6-S, and PTE on BCSCs were 50,
  25, and 25 M, respectively, which was more significant than their effects on MCF-7
  parental cells. Of note, none of these compounds had a cytotoxic effect on primary
  cultured rat hepatocytes at a concentration of 25 M for the same time frame. These
  results indicated that 6-S and PTE had potent selective toxic effects on BCSCs.
  Subsequent experiments evaluated the effects of 6-S and PTE on BCSC characteristics.

  MCF7 human breast cancer cells. MCF-7 cells or MCF7 CD44+/CD24 cells were treated

  6-S and PTE Induce Changes in Cell Morphology and Mammosphere-Forming Capacity of
  BCSCs


  The images of cell morphology in Figure 2A show that after a 6 h treatment with
  6-S or PTE, cell necrosis phenomena, such as membrane injury and bleb formation,
  were induced in BCSCs. Mammosphere formation is an important indicator of BCSC differentiation.
  After BCSCs were treated with 6-S or PTE for 72 h, robust mammosphere disruptions
  were induced, and the number of mammospheres was effectively reduced. In addition,
  this study further simulated a nutrient-deficient or -sufficient environment using
  SCM without FBS or RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS, respectively, to investigate
  the effects of 6-S and PTE on mammospheres under different FBS concentrations. The
  results showed that large BCSC mammospheres were easily induced in a nutrient-deficient
  environment, whereas mammospheres were at a dormant status in a nutrient-sufficient
  environment. Under culture conditions without FBS, PTE more effectively reduced
  the volume of mammospheres than 6-S and promoted their disintegration; however,
  in an environment containing FBS, neither compound had any influence on mammospheres.


  Figure 2. Effects of 6-G, 6-S, and PTE on BCSC morphology, mammosphere formation,
  and colony formation.  Images show the morphology of BCSCs treated with 100 M of
  the tested compounds for 6 h. The red arrows indicate blebs on the cell surface.  The
  left-side panels of the figure show mammosphere morphology changes for 0 and 72
  h. The right-side panels represent the number of mammospheres. The cells were treated
  with 25 or 50 M 6-S and PTE for 72 h. The boxes represent the 25th to 75th percentiles,
  and horizontal lines within the box represent mean  and median  values, respectively.

  assays.  Images show the morphology of mammospheres that were cultured in stem cell
  medium without FBS and in RPMI medium plus 10% FBS. The cells were grown in 0.3%

  differences from the control group. BCSCs, breast cancer stem cells.


  Effects of 6-S or PTE Combined with Paclitaxel on the Differentiated BCSC Population


  This study cultured BCSCs in RPMI medium containing 10% FBS to promote differentiation
  to observe the effects of the chemotherapeutic drug paclitaxel on the differentiated
  BCSC population when combined with either 6-S or PTE. Figure 3A shows that 10 nM
  paclitaxel had significant cytotoxic effects on the differentiated BCSC populations;
  however, this cytotoxicity was not increased when the dose was increased to 50 nM.
  It is worth noting that 6-S and PTE  already doubled the cytotoxicity of chemotherapeutic
  drugs on the differentiated BCSC populations at low doses ; therefore, they may
  increase the antitumor effects of chemotherapeutic drugs.


  Figure 3. Effects of paclitaxel with or without 6-S and PTE on cell morphology and
  viability of differentiated BCSCs. BCSCs were first cultured in RPMI medium plus
  10% FBS for 7 days to simulate differentiation. Cells were then treated with different
  concentrations of paclitaxel  and 10 nM paclitaxel plus 6-S or 10 nM paclitaxel
  plus PTE  for 72 h.  Quantified cell viability in groups A and B. The reported values
  are the mean  SD. Bars with different letters are significantly different from each
  other in individual assays.


  It is known that the degree of breast cancer cell malignancy is closely associated
  with the expression of CD44+/CD24 on stem cells. When the CD44 surface antigen is
  activated, breast cancer cell populations evolve into cell populations that have
  increased invasiveness. This study used flow cytometry to observe the effects of
  6-S or PTE on stem cell surface antigen expression in BCSCs. The cell population
  in the CD44+/CD24 quadrant was the BCSC population, whereas the cell population
  in the CD44/CD24 quadrant was the cell population that had lost stemness. Figure
  4 shows that after culture of 6-S or PTE  with BCSCs for 72 h, the number of BCSCs
  was inhibited, and the number of cells that did not have stemness was significantly
  increased. The maintenance of BCSC stemness was inhibited through a decrease in
  CD44 expression.

  BCSC population. Cells with CD44/CD24 represent a loss of stemness. , p &lt; 0.05,
  indicates significant differences compared with the control group.


  The hedgehog signal transduction pathway and -catenin transcription activity can
  regulate the differentiation and self-renewal of CSCs. Many studies have regarded
  the hedgehog pathway as an important indicator for the suppression of drug resistance
  in CSCs and tumor recurrence. This study cultured BCSCs in SCM with 6-S or PTE  for
  4, 8, and 24 h and analyzed the changes in the expression levels of hedgehog, phospho-Akt,
  Akt, phospho-GSK3, and GSK3. The results showed that 6-S  and PTE  effectively inhibited
  hedgehog protein expression and Akt and GSK3 phosphorylation.

  BCSCs. Cells were treated with 25 M of tested compounds for 4, 8, and 24 h, respectively.
  The relative density was compared with the control. All experiments were performed
  in duplicate and repeated at least three times. Quantitative data are expressed
  as the mean  standard deviation. Bars with different letters are significantly different
  from each other in individual assays.


  Effects of 6-S and PTE on -Catenin Phosphorylation and Downstream Protein Expression
  in BCSCs


  The Wnt/-catenin signaling transduction pathway is very important for the maintenance
  of CSC stemness. Studies have indicated that -catenin activation is an important
  target for regulation of CSC differentiation and inhibition of tumor recurrence.
  In this study, BCSCs were treated with 6-S or PTE  for 4, 8, and 24 h to analyze
  the changes in the expression of phospho--catenin, -catenin, cyclin D1, and c-Myc.
  The results showed that 6-S  and PTE, at a concentration of 25 M, significantly
  induced -catenin phosphorylation to increase its degradation and inhibit protein
  expression of cyclin D1 and c-Myc. Therefore, 6-S and PTE both effectively increased
  the level of -catenin phosphorylation and inhibited the expression of the downstream
  cyclin D1 and c-Myc proteins; the inhibitory effect of PTE was more significant.

  cyclin D1 in BCSCs. The cells were treated with 25 M of tested compounds for 4,
  8, and 24 h, respectively. The relative density was compared with the control. All
  experiments were performed in duplicate and repeated at least three times. Quantitative
  data are expressed as the mean  standard deviation. Bars with different letters
  are significantly different from each other in individual assays.


  General stem cells have the ability to differentiate into many different cells.
  However, abnormal stem cells will develop into abnormal cell populations. These
  abnormal stem cells are CSCs. Because CSCs can survive in a nutrient- and oxygen-deficient
  environment and have drug resistance, they are considered one reason that cancer
  cannot be completely cured.


  Phytochemicals have been discovered to have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and
  antitumor activities. Because their side effects can be milder than those of chemotherapeutic
  drugs, they have been extensively applied and investigated in clinical cancer studies.
  For example, citrus fruits are rich in NOL and 5-HF, which have been discovered
  in previous studies to have anti-invasion activity against cancer cells and can
  inhibit colon cancer proliferation and induce apoptosis. The study by Weng et al.
  showed that the active ingredients of ginger, 6-G and 6-S, and the component of
  berries, PTE, inhibit liver cancer cell metastasis. Our previous studies showed
  that 6-S and PTE inhibit invadopodia formation in breast cancer cells and inhibit
  invasive metastasis. Therefore, these two phytochemicals, 6-S and PTE, might have
  excellent antitumor potential. This study selected the above phytochemicals to investigate
  their effects on the suppression of BCSC survival and mammosphere formation as well
  as the effects of complementary chemotherapeutic drugs on BCSCs. The antitumor activity
  and the molecular mechanism of 6-S and PTE were also clarified.


  A review of the study by Gupta et al. and many other papers showed that because
  BCSCs have the feature of self-renewal and might produce drug resistance, during
  the screening of compounds that can inhibit BCSC survival, the culture time should
  be estimated to at least the third generation. Therefore, 72 h was selected as the
  culture time in this study to investigate the effects of these compounds. The MCF-7
  breast cancer cells and the human BCSCs isolated from MCF-7 cells using CD44+/CD24/low
  were treated with different concentrations  of 5-HF, 6-G, 6-S, NOL, and PTE to evaluate
  their effects on cell survival. 6-S and PTE demonstrated the highest cytotoxicity
  levels against BCSCs. After BCSCs were treated with 25 M 6-S or PTE for 72 h, the
  cell survival rate was reduced to &lt;50%. However, treatment of MCF-7 breast cancer
  cells with these two chemicals at 25 M  for 72 h showed that the cell survival rates
  were both maintained above 80%. Next, after BCSCs were treated with 6-G at 50 M
  for 72 h, the cell survival rate was also reduced to 50%, whereas under the same
  concentration and time, the survival rate of treated MCF-7 cells was maintained
  at 90%. Therefore, these three compounds might have the potential to specifically
  inhibit BCSCs. Further treatment of cells with these three compounds at a concentration
  of 25 or 100 M showed that 6-S and PTE promoted bleb formation on the surface of
  BCSCs within 36 h, whereas 6-G did not cause bleb formation under the same conditions.
  Therefore, it was speculated that 6-S and PTE had the most potential to inhibit
  BCSCs. Because their influences on the regulation of intracellular signaling proteins
  might start between 3 and 6 h, subsequent experiments selected 4, 8, and 24 h as
  controls.


  CSCs have self-renewal and high differentiation potentials. Their growth does not
  require serum, their number in cell populations is small, and they are present as
  an unstable suspension. In in vitro cultured BCSCs, they aggregate into floating
  clumps to facilitate attached differentiation. These clumps are called spheroids
  and are specifically called mammospheres in breast cancer cells. Mammospheres form
  a functional mammary tree after long-term culture. Studies have shown that treatment
  of sulforaphane  with BCSC-like cells isolated using ALDH for 7 days effectively
  reduced the size of mammospheres. Kakarala et al. treated mammospheres with curcumin
  or piperine and obtained similar results. The results of this study in Figure 2B,C
  confirmed that 6-S and PTE reduced the size and number of mammospheres.


  There are already several drugs in clinical use with excellent treatment effects
  on breast cancer such as cyclophosphamide, paclitaxel, doxorubicin, and docetaxel;
  therefore, current treatment strategies that target CSCs might supplement chemodrugs
  to achieve the goal of eliminating breast cancer. Therefore, the present study referenced
  the method of Lee et al. to add serum into the BCSC culture to promote cell differentiation
  to simulate the condition of tumor recurrence and growth. Next, 6-S, PTE, and paclitaxel
  were cultured with this cell population for 72 h to observe whether these two compounds
  and paclitaxel had a synergistic effect on the suppression of tumor growth. The
  results in Figure 3 show that although paclitaxel  had toxicity on the differentiated
  cell population of BCSCs, the effect was not dose dependent. Of note, 6-S and PTE
  had auxiliary effects on paclitaxel to reduce the survival of that cell population.
  Studies have shown that the combination of curcumin  and paclitaxel  significantly
  reduced tumor size in nude mice, decreased MMP-9 expression in tumor, and promoted
  breast cancer cell apoptosis. The study by Aggarwal et al. also indicated that curcumin,
  which is a polyphenolic compound similar to the samples used in this study, assists
  paclitaxel  in reducing the survival rate of breast cancer MDA-MB435 cells by 80%.


  The present study demonstrated that 6-S and PTE inhibit BCSCs from forming mammospheres
  and have synergistic effects with paclitaxel. To confirm the mechanism underlying
  the regulation of BCSC characteristics by these two compounds, further investigation
  was performed on whether the signaling pathway of BCSCs to maintain their self-renewal
  was affected by 6-S and PTE. CSCs are identified using different cell surface antigens;
  for example, BCSCs have been isolated using CD44+/CD24/low expression on the cell
  surface of MCF-7 cells. The decrease of CD44 expression reduced the tumorigenicity
  of BCSCs in vivo; thus, it was speculated that CD44 expression is associated with
  the maintenance of stemness. Therefore, this study cultured 6-S or PTE with BCSCs
  for 72 h to observe their influences on CD44 and CD24 cell surface antigens. Figure
  4 shows that 6-S and PTE effectively decreased the expression of CD44. This result
  was similar to the results of So et al., who used a novel Gemini vitamin D analogue,
  BXL0124. Recent studies also showed that caffeic acid phenethyl ester, a derivative
  of the natural polyphenolic compound caffeic acid, reduces the percentage of CSCs
  in the MDA-MB231 cell line to inhibit CSC proliferation. Studies have also shown
  that acetaminophen induces BCSC differentiation, decreases CD44 expression, and
  causes these cells to lose tumorigenicity in nude mice.


  It is known that hedgehog, Notch, PI3K/Akt, and Wnt/-catenin are associated with
  self-renewal of cells and stem cell survival in normal organs or embryonic stem
  cells. Studies have indicated that these signaling pathways might also participate
  in the maintenance of the stemness of CD44+/CD24/low BCSCs. CSCs play very important
  roles in the recurrence and growth of many tumors, whereas Wnt/-catenin is associated
  with CSC differentiation. In many antitumor  studies that have targeted CSCs, the
  inhibition of intracellular concentration and the transcription activity of -catenin
  were used as a target. Hope et al. used a low dose of resveratrol to regulate -catenin
  transcription activities and achieved the inhibition of the differentiation of many
  liver cancer cells to prevent the aggravation of liver cancer. Therefore, inhibition
  of the transcription activity of -catenin might successfully inhibit CSCs to produce
  drug resistance and promote tumor recurrence.


  Studies showed that the EMT pathway can induce tumor cells to produce CSCs with
  stemness; therefore, if EMT activation could be inhibited through the TGF- or Wnt
  signaling pathways, then CSC proliferation could be reduced. The EMT pathway is
  induced by the Twist and Snail proteins. Twist can inhibit the phosphorylation of
  the downstream -catenin and Snail proteins through the promotion of phosphorylation
  of Akt  and GSK3  to increase CD44 expression and achieve the goal of maintaining
  stemness. In addition, Twist can also inhibit E-cadherin activation and its ability
  to bind -catenin, which further inhibits cell invasion and metastasis. The regulation
  of Akt and GSK3 is also affected by the hedgehog signaling pathway. Sonic hedgehog
  interacts with its transmembrane receptor patched to release smoothed protein to
  further activate PI3K and Akt, thus promoting GSK3 phosphorylation and reducing
  its activity. When GSK3 activity decreased, -catenin phosphorylation is reduced,
  and its degradation pathway is suppressed; at the same time, CG44 expression is
  increased. Excess -catenin translocates into the nucleus to promote cell proliferation
  and differentiation and then interacts with the TCF/LEF complex to transcribe cyclin
  D1 and c-Myc. Furthermore, the levels of phosphorylated Akt, phosphorylated GSK3,
  and -catenin in mammospheres are all significantly higher than those in general
  attachment-type tumor cells. Introduction of the Akt inhibitor perifosine  into
  mammary stem cells or progenitor cells promotes -catenin phosphorylation. Therefore,
  this study focused on whether 6-S and PTE had inhibitory effects on the signaling
  pathways that maintained the above CSC characteristics.


  Results in this study showed that treatment of BCSCs with 6-S  for 8 h significantly
  decreased hedgehog expression and Akt phosphorylation. 6-S at a concentration of
  25 M significantly decreased hedgehog expression and Akt phosphorylation after 4
  h, and this effect was stably maintained for 24 h. Figure 6A shows that treatment
  of BCSCs with 6-S  for 8 h increased -catenin phosphorylation and caused its degradation.
  Further observation of the expression of downstream cyclin D1 and c-Myc proteins
  also showed that 6-S at a concentration of 25 M triggered down-regulation of cyclin
  D1 and c-Myc within 4 h. A previous study treated a polyphenolic compound, curcumin,
  with MDA-MB435 breast cancer cells and showed that the expression of cyclin D1 and
  c-Myc proteins was inhibited.


  The results in Figure 5B show that PTE cultured with BCSCs significantly inhibited
  hedgehog expression and Akt phosphorylation. In addition, with regard to GSK3 activity,
  PTE reduced the levels of GSK3 phosphorylation. At 25 M, PTE increased -catenin
  phosphorylation and promoted its degradation. Further observation of the downstream
  cyclin D1 and c-Myc protein expression showed that PTE also effectively reduced
  the expression of these two proteins. The study by Lepourcelet et al. also observed
  that the two natural compounds isolated from fungi, PKF115-584 and CGF049090, significantly
  inhibited the intracellular concentrations of -catenin and the expression of cyclin
  D1 and c-Myc proteins.


  In summary, the increased phosphorylation of -catenin by 6-S and PTE might be through
  the reduction of hedgehog protein expression and Akt and GSK3 phosphorylation, thus
  reducing the expression of downstream c-Myc and cyclin D1 proteins. Therefore, 6-S
  and PTE activated -catenin degradation to reduce CD44 activity and affect the maintenance
  of stemness of CSCs to further induce the loss of tumorigenicity of these BCSCs.


  Figure 7. Schematic representation of the mechanisms of action by 6-S and PTE in
  the inhibition of BCSC stemness. 6-S and PTE mediate CD44 expression through the
  reduction of hedgehog and -catenin in BCSCs. 6-S and PTE lead to reduced expression
  of hedgehog, inhibit the phosphorylation of Akt and GSK3, and decrease the translocation
  of -catenin, followed by the down-regulation of CD44, c-Myc, and cyclin D1 expression.
