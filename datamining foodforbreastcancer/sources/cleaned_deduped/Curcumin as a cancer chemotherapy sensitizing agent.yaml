  Introduction The burden of cancer is increasing worldwide. About 14.1 million new
  cancer cases and 8.2 million cancer deaths are estimated to have occurred based
  on GLOBOCAN 2012, the standard data set produced to estimate cancer incidence and
  mortality worldwide by the International Agency for Research on Cancer  for 2012.
  In spite of continuous cancer prevention efforts, cancer incidence increases globally
  with the growth of the elderly population. IARC also projected that deaths from
  cancer will substantially increase to over 19.3 million in 2025. Therefore, it is
  important to design better strategies for cancer treatment to increase the quality
  of life of growing cancer patients. Although local and regional tumors can be effectively
  treated by surgery and radiation therapy, chemotherapy is currently used for most
  cancer patients, because effective treatment requires reaching every organ in the
  body. Traditional chemotherapy is a drug treatment that uses chemicals to kill fast-growing
  cells such as cancer cells. The first widely used cancer drugs, nitrogen mustards
  and antifolate drugs, were discovered in the 1940s. It was decade later that the
  molecular actions of those drugs were identified as induction of DNA damage, leading
  development of many anticancer compounds that use the same principle to treat cancer
  cells. Those compounds include cisplatin, doxorubicin, and 5-fluorouracil, which
  are still used as the mainstay treatment of many types of cancer. The development
  of chemotherapeutic agents made a significant progress in systemic treatments -
  relieving cancer burden and improving quality of life of cancer patients. However,
  these traditional chemotherapeutic drugs often confront the limitation in their
  use. A major problem is intrinsic and/or acquired resistance of cancer cells to
  the drug. Another obstacle rises from their adverse effect to normal cells - particularly
  rapidly growing cells. These limitations led to new designs for chemotherapy such
  as modification of Y. Kwon  Department of Food Science and Engineering, Ewha Womans
  University, Seoul, Republic of Korea E-mail: Youngjoo.Kwon@ewha.ac.kr 274 J Korean
  Soc Appl Biol Chem  57, 273280 compounds to be more specific to cancer cells and/or
  development of new type of therapeutic drugs that target the processes of caner
  development specifically at the molecular level, namely molecular targeted therapy.
  Therefore, molecular targeted therapies are expected to be more selective than traditional
  chemotherapy and do less harm to normal cells. Progress in knowledge of cancer biology
  gave rise to development of many monoclonal antibodies and small molecules that
  interfere with a specific molecular target involved in tumor growth and progression.
  Transition from traditional chemotherapy to targeted therapy is obviously an important
  advance in cancer treatment. However, targeted therapy still faces the same limitation
  that traditional chemotherapy has - resistance to drug and drug- induced toxicity.
  Although these novel targeted therapies are highly selective, molecules that they
  target are also expressed in normal cells and potentially disrupt normal cellular
  function. Moreover, cancer is highly heterogeneous disease that displays diverse
  phenotypes and functions among cancer cells within the same tumor. This heterogeneity
  of cancer makes it difficult to be treated with the single targeted therapy. Therefore,
  more effective treatment can be achieved by combining existing cancer therapeutic
  drugs  together or using them with novel compounds. Understanding of molecular action
  of each compound is critical to designing combination therapy that act through synergistic
  or complementary mechanisms to overcome resistance to therapy and reduce toxicity
  derived from chemotherapy. Many food bioactive compounds have exhibited anticancer
  activity. Hence, they can be good candidates for combination therapy with either
  traditional or targeted chemotherapy to enhance efficacy of cancer treatment and
  reduce drug toxicity by lowering the dose of drug. However, a major obstacle to
  using food-derived bioactive compounds in combination therapy might be that their
  anticancer mechanisms are not well-defined. Curcumin is a polyphenolic compound
  that gives the strong yellow color to the spice turmeric, powdered rhizome of Curcuma
  longa. It is one of the compounds that have been extensively studied for its anticancer
  activity in many types of cancer. In addition, it has been extensively used for
  flavor and color in food preparation as well as treatment of inflammatory conditions
  and other diseases in East Asia. During its long history of usage in diet, almost
  no toxicity of curcumin yet has been reported, making it a good candidate for combination
  therapy. Many studies also demonstrated effectiveness of combinational use of curcumin
  to improve efficacy of TRAIL- mediated immunotherapy  and radiation therapy. This
  article will focus on curcumin use in combination with traditional chemotherapeutic
  drugs. In this article, the molecular mechanisms that are involved in resistance
  to the drug will be introduced, and studies that have evaluated curcumin effect
  on the drug efficacy will be summarized, leading to discussion on potential usefulness
  of combinational treatment of curcumin and traditional chemotherapeutic drugs. Cisplatin
  Cisplatin or cis-diamminedichloridoplatinum is the first platinum- based chemotherapeutic
  drug. The best understood mechanism of cisplatin action involves crosslinking of
  DNA base, often with guanine, and this DNA lesion triggers inhibition of DNA replication
  and induction of apoptosis, leading cell death upon unrepairable DNA damage. Carboplatin
  and oxaliplatin are also platinum-based analogs that act by forming DNA crosslinks
  as well. Cisplatin was first approved by FDA in 1978 for the treatment of testicular
  and bladder cancers and has been widely used for a broad spectrum of cancers including
  testicular, bladder, ovarian, cervical, lung, and head and neck cancers. Many tumors
  are initially responsive to cisplatin treatment; however, the majority of cancer
  patients eventually relapse as disease becomes refractory to cisplatin. Therefore,
  besides the known cytotoxicities of cisplatin in the kidney, ears, and peripheral
  nerves, the high incidence of developing resistance to cisplatin is the main challenge
  to the clinical use of cisplatin as an anticancer drug. Many mechanisms of cisplatin
  resistance have been proposed including alteration in cellular uptake and efflux
  of drug, increased metabolism of the drug, increased DNA repair, and inhibition
  of apoptosis. Cisplatin resistance also relates with the altered activation of signaling
  pathways that may lead to increase cell survival. Curcumin was treated in combination
  with cisplatin to reverse the cisplatin resistance and/or to enhance the efficacy
  of cisplatin in different types of cancer. Many molecular mechanisms of anticancer
  effect of curcumin have been reported, and they were implicated with chemosensitizing
  mechanisms of curcumin to cisplatin. One of the well-appreciated anticancer mechanisms
  of curcumin involves inhibition of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain- enhancer of
  activated B cells  activation. NF-B is a transcription factor that activates gene
  transcripts involving resistance to apoptosis, and cell cycle regulators  upon translocation
  to the nucleus. High activation of NF-B is reported in many cancer types. Thus,
  co-treatment of curcumin with the existing chemotherapeutic drugs becomes an attractive
  strategy to treat tumors with high expression of NF-B or IB kinase  that subsequently
  allows translocation of NF-B. J Korean Soc Appl Biol Chem  57, 273280 275 Hartojo
  et al.  reported that curcumin effectively reduced NF-B activity and increased apoptosis
  in esophageal adenocarcinoma cells. Curcumin  made an additive effect on induction
  of apoptosis in esophageal adenocarcinoma cell treated in combination with cisplatin,
  suggesting potential complementary mechanisms of activating apoptosis pathways by
  two compounds. In another study, it was demonstrated that curcumin and cisplatin
  induced apoptosis through different mechanisms - curcumin induced apoptosis through
  inhibition of IKKb expression and subsequent suppression of NF-B activation, whereas
  cisplatin enhanced apoptosis in p53-dependent pathway in head and squamous cell
  carcinoma  cells. In agreement with in vitro results, co-treatment of curcumin and
  subtherapeutic dose of cisplatin significantly inhibited tumor growth compared to
  treatment of individual agent alone. Potentiation of anticancer effect of cisplatin
  by curcumin could be also mediated through inhibition of signal transducer and activator
  of transcription-3  proteins, another important transcription factor that activates
  genes that increase cell survival. STAT family proteins are phosphorylated and activated
  by receptor- associated kinases in response to various cytokines and growth factors.
  Activated STAT proteins translocate to the cell nucleus, where they act as transcription
  activators and mediate the expression of a variety of genes. Among known seven STAT
  family proteins, STAT-3 is the most appreciated in the pathogenesis of cancer. Upon
  activation, STAT-3 transcriptionally activates genes that inhibit apoptosis, regulate
  cell cycle, and induces angiogenesis. In contrast to the transient nature of STAT-
  3 activation in normal cells, STAT-3 is constitutively activated in many cancers
  and therefore making a good target for anticancer agent. Treatment of curcumin-derived
  liposomal FLLL32 at IC 50 level  inhibited phosphorylation of STAT-3 in HNSCC cells.
  Combinational treatment of FLLL32 and cisplatin at near IC 50 of individual agent
  enhanced apoptosis compared to treatment of individual drug alone, allowing a similar
  or enhanced anticancer effect at lower dose of cisplatin. Curcumin analogue of HO-3867
  also reversed cisplatin resistance through down-regulation of STAT-3 signaling pathway
  in ovarian cancer. Interestingly, STAT-3 was highly activated in cisplatin-resistant
  cancer cells compared to sensitive parent lines. Combinational treatment of cisplatin
  \ and HO-3867  significantly inhibited constitutive activation of STAT-3 compared
  to cisplatin treatment alone in ovarian tumor xenografts. Activation of Akt and
  Notch is also known to mediate tumorigenesis and resistance to therapeutic drugs
  including platinum-based drugs by enhancing cell survival. Some studies also suggested
  that curcumin may resensitize cisplatin-resistant cells through suppression of Akt
  or Notch signaling. These studies indicated that co-treatment of curcumin may potentiate
  the effect of cisplatin or reverse the drug resistance by modulating transcription
  factor activities that increase cell survival and thereby, result in enhancement
  of apoptosis induced by cisplatin. However, these studies did not clearly demonstrate
  the cause and effect relationship between curcumin-induced suppression of cell survival
  pathways and chemosensitization of curcumin to cisplatin. Chanvorachote et al.  suggested
  mechanisms that curcumin directly regulates apoptosis rather than modulates activation
  of transcriptional factors. In their study, curcumin induced proteasomal degradation
  of Bcl-2, a major anti-apoptotic protein, resulting in down- regulation of Bcl-2
  and sensitizing Bcl-2 overexpressing non small cell lung cancer  cells to cisplatin-induced
  apoptosis. This novel mechanism of apoptosis regulation by curcumin may also mediate
  chemosensitizing effect of curcumin. Cisplatin-sensitizing effect of curcumin was
  also achieved by inhibiting DNA repair. DNA repair is an important mechanism for
  prevention of cancer by correcting damaged DNA in normal cells. However, high activation
  of DNA repair can interfere with the action of drugs that induce DNA damage. Therefore,
  it has been challenged to treat cancer cells with intact DNA damage response  and
  overexpression of DNA repair enzymes such as excision repair cross-complementary
  1. Treatment of curcumin at the range of 5-40 M down- regulated ERCC1 at mRNA and
  protein levels through inactivation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase1/2,
  extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2  signaling in NSCLC. Ogiwara et al.  reported
  that curcumin suppressed DDR response by inhibition of DNA damage checkpoint and
  DNA double-strand break repair. Therefore, curcumin can lower the dose of cisplatin
  with similar or enhanced cytotoxicity perhaps mainly through the ability of curcumin
  to suppress survival signaling pathways and cellular DNA repair, concordantly increasing
  apoptosis in the cisplatin-treated cells. Doxorubicin Doxorubicin also termed adriamycin
  is an anthracycline anticancer drug that has been used as first-line therapy for
  many types of cancer. Doxorubicin acts by interacting with DNA - intercalation between
  two base pairs of the DNA. Intercalation with DNA prevents the progression of topoisomerase
  II that relaxes supercoiled DNA, resulting in DNA double strand breaks. In response
  to double strand breaks, normally DDR is activated to repair the DNA damage but
  failure of repair triggers apoptosis. Doxorubicin-induced DNA damage more rapidly
  affects replicating cells such as cancer cells than normal cells as is the case
  with other traditional chemotherapeutic drugs. In addition, 276 J Korean Soc Appl
  Biol Chem  57, 273280 Pang et al.  demonstrated a novel mechanism of doxorubicin
  action. Doxorubicin induces histone eviction from chromatin that contributes to
  deregulation of DDR, making cancer cells more susceptible to DNA-damaging agents.
  Doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity is well recognized, although its mechanism remains
  unclear. Doxorubicin can produce fatal cardiac toxicity with increasing dose that
  results in dose limitation in the use of doxorubicin. In addition, intrinsic and
  acquired resistance to doxorubicin is common. The most common mechanism is overexpression
  of P- glycoprotein, a membrane pump responsible for drug efflux, reducing drug concentration
  inside the cell. Another member of membrane pump, breast cancer related protein,
  also contributes to resistance against doxorubicin. Other mechanisms involved in
  drug resistance are alterations in DNA damage-sensing, repair capability of cancer
  cells, and alteration in apoptosis signaling. Reduced topoisomerase II expression
  is another major factor that attributes to doxorubicin resistance. In addition,
  HuR, the RNA binding protein, has been suggested to be involved in resistance to
  doxorubicin. HuR acts as an mRNA stabilizer and/or a translational enhancer that
  binds to a large AU-rich element containing mRNAs. Upon exposure to doxorubicin,
  HuR translocates into the cytoplasm, which was necessary for the doxorubicin-induced
  apoptosis in a breast cancer cell line, MCF-7 cells. Doxorubicin-resistant cell
  presented lower expression of HuR and restoration of HuR expression sensitized to
  the drug. Cancer cells often exhibit multifactorial nature in drug resistance and
  this was reinforced in the study of AbuHammad and Zihlif. Analysis on gene expression
  change associated with the doxorubicin-resistant phenotype in a breast cancer cell
  line revealed alteration in a broad range of genes involved in drug metabolism,
  drug efflux, topoisomerase II expression, cell cycle, apoptosis, and DNA repair.
  High activation of NF-B was also implicated in resistance to doxorubicin although
  it remains controversial whether NF-B activation is required for doxorubicin-induced
  apoptosis or oppositely makes resistant to the drug-induced apoptosis. However,
  it seems to be consistent that cells exposed to doxorubicin elevate NF-B activation.
  Doxorubicin treatment induced transcriptional repression and degradation of IB that
  resulted in activation of NF-B and increase of Bcl-2 transcription to impart survival
  advantage to drug-resistant cells. Curcumin was evaluated for doxorubicin sensitizing
  potential primarily through its ability to suppress NF-B activation. Compared to
  doxorubicin treatment  alone, pretreatment of curcumin  effectively reduced cell
  viability in doxorubicin-resistant breast cancer cells. Curcumin inhibited NF-B
  activation in drug- resistant cells and this inhibition allowed p53-depenent activation
  of apoptosis, thereby sensitizing doxorubicin. Consistently, NF-B activation induced
  by doxorubicin was attenuated by curcumin co-treatment in hepatoma cell lines. In
  agreement with in vitro findings, curcumin and doxorubicin combinational treatment
  exhibited greater inhibitory effect on the growth of tumor bearing doxorubicin-
  resistant ovarian sarcoma cells compared to single treatment of doxorubicin. This
  study also demonstrated a simultaneous decrease in drug-induced systemic toxicity
  by curcumin, suggesting that reduction of adverse effect by curcumin might also
  contribute to enhancement of doxorubicin efficacy. Hence, previous studies suggested
  that curcumin may potentiate doxorubicin efficacy by altering NF-B activation and
  decreasing drug toxicity. Unfortunately, these studies did not elucidate cause and
  effect relationship between curcumin-induced suppression of NF-B activation and
  the enhancement of doxorubicin efficacy by curcumin. 5-Fluorouracil  Antimetabolites
  represent a class of anticancer drugs that mimic normal cellular molecules  and
  consequently interfere with DNA replication. 5-FU is a pyrimidine analog that also
  includes capecitabine, floxuridine, and gemcitabine. The incorporation of purine
  and pyrimidine analogs into DNA during S-phase of cell cycle prevents proper nucleotide
  addition, causing DNA replication failure. 5- FU can be incorporated into DNA or
  RNA in place of thymine or uracil, respectively, and prevents the addition of the
  next nucleotide due to a fluoride atom at the 5-carbon position on the ring, resulting
  in termination of chain elongation and consequently induction of apoptosis. 5-FU
  also initiates apoptosis by targeting thymidylate synthase, a rate- limiting enzyme
  in production of deoxythymidine triphosphate. 5-FU forms a covalent ternary complex
  with 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate and TS, resulting in inhibition of DNA synthesis.
  However, prolonged exposure to 5-FU appeared to increase the expression of TS, making
  free TS available for DNA synthesis. Not surprisingly, several studies have demonstrated
  strong association between increased TS expression and development of resistance
  to 5-FU. Yoo et al  reported that elevation of astrocyte elevated gene-1  was related
  with 5-FU resistance in hepatocellular carcinoma through its capability of inducing
  LSF transcription factor that regulates TS transcription. In addition, AEG-1 increased
  dihydrophyrimidine dehydrogenase that inactivates 5-FU by catalyzing conversion
  of 5-FU to inactive fluoro-5,6-dihyrouracil, augmenting 5-FU resistance. In contrast,
  Wang et al.  did not observe apparent increase of TS expression in 5-FU-resistant
  lines when they compared expression profiles of pairs of 5-FU resistant and drug-sensitive
  parental cancer cells. Cells resistant to J Korean Soc Appl Biol Chem  57, 273280
  277 5-FU exhibited phenotypes of slower growth, higher proportion of G 1, and lower
  proportion of S phase that may allow time to repair when 5-FU is incorporated into
  DNA chain and protect cells from death triggered by 5-FU-induced DNA damage. Cells
  irresponsive to 5-FU consistently exhibited high expression of p65  at both mRNA
  and protein levels. Furthermore, p65 in resistant cells had high DNA binding and
  transcriptional activities, suggesting that high activation of NF-B signaling pathway
  plays an important role in 5-FU resistance. Possible combinational use of curcumin
  with 5-FU have been studied in different cancers. In these studies, NF-B inhibitory
  effect of curcumin was implicated as a major molecular mechanism underlying chemosensitization
  of 5-FU by curcumin. Relatively high concentration of curcumin  effectively suppressed
  the constitutively active NF-B in esophageal squamous carcinoma cells through the
  inhibition of IB phosphorylation, subsequently down-regulating the NF-B-regulated
  genes, Bcl-2 and cyclin D1. The same group also reported that effect of curcumin
  \ was comparable or superior to p65 siRNA in inhibition of p65 expression and IB
  phosphorylation, leading reduction of cell viability and enhancement of apoptosis
  in esophageal squamous carcinoma cells. Curcumin also effectively sensitized colon
  cancer cells to 5-FU treatment with more physiologically achievable dose. Pretreatment
  of 5 M curcumin reduced the amount of 5-FU by 5-fold compared to IC 50 of 5-FU in
  order to achieve the same cytotoxicity in colon cancer cells. This synergistic effect
  of curcumin and 5-FU was related with collaborative alteration of apoptosis- regulatory
  proteins including caspase-8, caspase-9, caspase-3, Bax, and Bcl-xL in both colon
  cancer cells in vitro and their xenografts. Furthermore, this potentiation of anticancer
  effect of 5-FU in the presence of curcumin was associated with curcumin-induced
  suppression of NF-B and phosphoinositide 3-kinase signaling activated by 5-FU. More
  comprehensive mechanistic study that involves curcumin- mediated chemosensitization
  to 5-FU was conducted by Vinod et al.. Curcumin synergized cytotoxicity induced
  by 5-FU treatment in breast cancer cells regardless of their estrogen and progesterone
  receptor status. This synergizing effect of curcumin involves the ability of curcumin
  to inhibit NF- B activation and degradation of IB induced by 5-FU, subsequently
  enhancing 5-FU-induced apoptosis through caspase- dependent cleavage of poly ADP
  ribose polymerase. Interestingly, TS was upstream regulator of NF- B activation
  in breast cancer cells exposed to 5-FU. 5-FU treatment induced TS expression and
  curcumin pretreatment significantly down-regulated 5-FU-induced up- regulation of
  TS. Therefore, enhancement of 5-FU anticancer effect was also mainly through modulating
  NF- B activation. Gemcitabine Gemcitabine  is a fluorinated analog of deoxycytidine
  that can be incorporated into DNA during DNA replication, causing inhibition of
  DNA synthesis and apoptosis. It also inhibits ribonucleotide reductase  involved
  in deoxyribonucleotide synthesis required for DNA synthesis; thereby inhibiting
  RNR by gemcitabine induces apoptosis. Gemcitabine has been used as a first-line
  treatment for patients with advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer; however, the
  disease develops resistance to the drug. Cellular mechanisms responsible for resistance
  to gemcitabine are less understood. High activation of ERK appeared to be implicated
  in gemcitabine resistance, although studies did not demonstrate definitive causality.
  ERK was highly activated in pancreatic cancer cell lines that exhibit high degree
  of resistance to gemcitabine. Zheng et al.  also suggested that high ERK activity
  may protect pancreatic cancer cells from gemcitabine- induced apoptosis. Moreover,
  Skrypek et al.  demonstrated that the MUC4 mucin mediates gemcitabine resistance
  in pancreatic cancer cells, and MUC4 induced gemcitabine resistance by regulating
  the expression of nucleoside transporters  and ratio of apoptosis-related proteins,
  Bax/Bcl-xL. Interestingly, NF-B was shown to mediate the regulation of hCNT1 expression
  by MUC4. NF-B activation down-regulated the hCNT1 expression, resulting in decreased
  gemcitabine uptake and efficiency. In addition, regulation of Bax/Bcl-xL ratio by
  MUC4 was mediated through the NF-B. Furthermore, they reported that decreased expression
  of NF-B led to increased sensitivity to gemcitabine, suggesting potential improvement
  of gemcitabine efficacy by targeting the NF-B pathway with natural or chemical inhibitors.
  Curcumin was tested for potential combinational use to enhance the effect of gemcitabine
  or overcome chemoresistance to the drug. Curcumin  inhibited constitutive NF-B activation
  in pancreatic cancer cell lines. Co-treatment of curcumin  and gemcitabine  effectively
  enhanced cytotoxicity and apoptosis at the concentrations of individual compounds
  that were minimally effective. The same study also validated potentiation of gemcitabine
  effect by curcumin in orthotopic pancreatic tumor model. This synergistic effect
  of curcumin was related with inhibition of NF-B activation and subsequent down-regulation
  of NF-B-regulated proteins including VEGF, cyclooxygenase-2, cyclin D1, c-Myc, Bcl-2,
  Bcl-xL, and c-IAP-1. Similarly, difluorinated curcumin, a synthetic analogue of
  curcumin, synergized gemcitabine effect in pancreatic cancer but with lower concentration
  due to greater bioavailability of CDF compared to the parent compound. Combinational
  treatment of CDF  and gemcitabine  greatly decreased cell viability in consistence
  278 J Korean Soc Appl Biol Chem  57, 273280 with increased apoptosis and suppression
  of NF-B activation. They also reported that CDF either by itself or combined with
  gemcitabine significantly down-regulated miR-21 that is overexpressed in gemcitabine-resistant
  cells. Interestingly, down-regulation of miR-21 correlated with reactivation of
  phosphatase and tensin homolog  that induces the cell cycle arrest. Likewise, CDF
  restores PTEN expression in colon cancer cells through down-regulation of miR-21.
  Thus, curcumin increased gemcitabine efficacy by suppression of NF-B activation
  and reactivation of PTEN. Conclusions The development of cancer chemotherapy made
  a significant progress in cancer treatment. However, both traditional and targeted
  chemotherapeutic drugs are challenged by drug-induced toxicity and resistance to
  drug in spite of tremendous effort to improve therapy. Combination therapy has been
  suggested as a strategy to avoid therapeutic drug resistance while cutting down
  the drug-derived toxicity by lowering the dose of each drug. Many food bioactive
  compounds have exhibited anticancer activity and can be good candidates for combination
  therapy as well. For successful combination therapy, however, it is important to
  identify molecular mechanisms of each compound and combine two or more agents that
  work together in complementary or synergistic ways. Main obstacle of using food
  compounds in combination therapy might be that their mechanisms of anticancer actions
  are less understood, making difficult to establish strategies to combine with available
  therapeutic drugs or other bioactive food compounds. Curcumin is one of food compounds
  that exert anticancer activity in many types of cancer and has been extensively
  studied for its mechanisms of anticancer action. In addition, there are efforts
  to enhance bioavailability of curcumin by modifying curcumin structure and liposomal
  delivery. Combinational treatment of curcumin enhanced therapeutic efficacy of chemotherapeutic
  drugs, cisplatin, doxorubicin, 5-FU, and gemcitabine. NF-B is a major downstream
  effector that leads to chemoresistance of many therapeutic drugs. Down-regulation
  of NF-B by curcumin is an effective mechanism to sensitize to the drugs. Therefore,
  combinational use of curcumin and available anticancer drugs has great potential
  to enhance chemotherapy efficacy and improve clinical treatment of cancer. More
  studies will be required to elucidate cause effect relationship of curcumin-induced
  suppression of cell survival pathways and enhancement of drug efficacy by curcumin.
