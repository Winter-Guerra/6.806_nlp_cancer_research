  disparities in red meat and poultry intake and breast cancer risk.md
text: "\n\nResearch on the role of red meat and poultry consumption in breast carcinogenesis
  is inconclusive, but the evidence in African-American  women is lacking. The association
  between consuming meat and breast cancer risk was examined in the Womens Circle
  of Health Study involving 803 AA cases, 889 AA controls, 755 Caucasian cases, and
  701 Caucasian controls. \n\nDietary information was collected using a Food Frequency
  Questionnaire. Odds ratios  and 95 % confidence intervals  were obtained from logistic
  regression models adjusting for potential covariates.\n\nComparing the fourth versus
  the first quartiles, among Caucasian women, processed meat, unprocessed red meat,
  and poultry intakes  increased breast cancer risk. Risk associated with poultry
  intake was more dominant in premenopausal women  and for women with ER tumors  in
  the Caucasian group. Associations in AA women were mostly null except for a significant
  increased risk trend with processed meat consumption for ER+ tumors.\n\nOverall,
  associations between breast cancer risk and consumption of red meat and poultry
  were of different magnitude in AA and Caucasian women, with further differences
  noted by menopausal and hormone receptor status in Caucasian women. This is the
  first study to examine racial differences in meat and breast cancer risk and represents
  some of the first evidence in AA women.\n\nBreast cancer remains the most commonly
  diagnosed non-skin cancer in both Caucasian and African-American  women in the USA.
  Meat consumption in the USA has been rising, but the impact on breast cancer is
  inconclusive, although the evidence is largely based on data from Caucasian women.
  Nevertheless, due to strong evidence linking red and processed meats to other cancers
  such as colorectal cancer, the World Cancer Research Fund and American Institute
  for Cancer Research recommends limiting red meat intake to less than 500 g/week
  \ with very little if any to be processed.\n\nAlthough the overall incidence of
  breast cancer is higher in Caucasian women, AA women are more likely to be diagnosed
  at younger ages and present with tumors with more aggressive characteristics, with
  high grade, lack of expression of estrogen receptor, and basal-like phenotypes.
  Despite these disparities, a recent review  that summarized the evidence on food,
  nutrition, and physical activity and breast cancer risk in AA women found no studies
  on any foods of animal origin and breast cancer risk in AA women. In parallel, there
  are clear racial differences in red meat and poultry consumption patterns with NHANES
  data showing higher mean consumption of red meat and poultry in AA compared with
  Caucasian women. The relevance of red meat and poultry consumption to carcinogenesis
  involves cooking meat at high temperatures and the exposure to heterocyclic amines,
  nitrosamines, saturated fat, and heme iron.\n\nMost epidemiological evidence supports
  a positive association between degrees of meat doneness and risk of human cancers.
  A greater proportion of AA also report grilling or barbequing hamburgers and beefsteak
  than Caucasians in the USA based on data adapted from FDA/USDA Consumer Food Safety
  Surveys, which elevate the need to investigate the relationship between meat and
  breast cancer in a large sample of AA women. We evaluated the role of red meat and
  poultry intake and breast cancer risk in the Womens Circle of Health Study, a casecontrol
  study based in New Jersey  and New York. This is one of the first studies to examine
  this association in AA women, and the first study to report findings stratified
  by race.\n\nThe Womens Circle of Health Study  has been described in detail elsewhere.
  In brief, WCHS is a casecontrol study conducted in NY and NJ involving both Caucasian
  and AA women. In NY, cases were recruited through major hospitals with large referral
  patterns for AA women in four boroughs of the metropolitan NYC area. Controls were
  identified through random digit dialing  of residential telephone and cell phone
  numbers; recruitment in NYC ended in 2008. In NJ, data collection was based at The
  Cancer Institute of New Jersey. Newly diagnosed women with histologically confirmed
  invasive breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ  were identified through the
  NJ State Cancer Registry using rapid case ascertainment in seven NJ counties, including
  Bergen, Essex, Hudson, Mercer, Middlesex, Passaic, and Union. All AA women meeting
  the eligibility criteria and a random sample of eligible Caucasian women matched
  to AA cases by county were identified. Caucasian and AA controls were recruited
  through RDD supplemented by community recruitment efforts for AA women in the same
  counties  with the help of community partners and AA breast cancer advocates. Recruitment
  in NJ concluded in March 2012. The eligibility criteria for cases were as follows:
  self-identified AA and Caucasian women, 2075 years of age at diagnosis, no previous
  history of cancer except non-melanoma skin cancer, recently diagnosed with primary,
  histologically confirmed breast cancer or DCIS, and English speaking. Controls without
  a history of any cancer diagnosis other than non-melanoma skin cancer living in
  the same seven NJ counties as cases were frequency matched to cases by self-reported
  race and age.\n\nData collection for the WCHS took place during an in-person interview
  and included the main study questionnaire  that elicited information on demographics
  and known and potential risk factors for breast cancer such as physical activity,
  hormone use, reproductive history, alcohol consumption, and smoking. Measures of
  body composition were collected by bioelectrical impedance analyses using the Tanita
  scale, while height, waist, and hip circumferences were measured by the interviewers.\n\nThe
  GSEL-Food Frequency Questionnaire  developed by the Nutrition Assessment Shared
  Resource at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center  queried about both usual
  frequency and portion size for approximately 125 food items, including red meat
  and poultry, during the 12 months prior to reference date  to ensure comparability
  in recall period. For each food item, a medium serving size was specified, and participants
  were asked whether they consumed a small serving, the same quantity as the given
  medium serving size, or a large serving.\n\nThe GSEL-FFQ was based on questionnaires
  used in two large NIH-funded studies, the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention
  Trial  and the VITamins And Lifestyle study. Validation data for the FFQ used in
  WCHS also come from the Womens Health Initiative, the largest research study in
  the USA with a focus on diet and health also based at the FHCRC. A detailed validation
  study of the FFQ by Paterson et al.  demonstrated that the WHI FFQ which was compared
  to criterion such as the 24-h dietary recall and 7-day food record had similar or
  better measurement properties than other popular FFQs such as Block FFQ. Another
  validation study that specifically assessed the validity and reliability of the
  WHI FFQ in minority populations observed that when using self-administered FFQs
  in minority or poorly educated populations, there is a need for participant training.
  To address this concern in the WCHS, although the FFQ was generally self-administered,
  it was completed as part of the in-person appointment to allow the interviewer to
  educate all participants about how to respond to the FFQ.\n\nIn addition to querying
  red meat and poultry consumption, processed red meat items included lunch meats
  and items such as bacon, sausages, bratwursts, chorizo, salami, and hot dogs. Total
  red meat was computed as the sum of processed and unprocessed red meat. The poultry
  variable was created as the summation of two FFQ items: fried chicken, including
  nuggets and tenders and roasted, stewed, grilled, or broiled chicken and turkey,
  and hence does not include processed poultry. Total consumption of each food group
  in grams was calculated as a function of frequency and portion size of intake.\n\nOverall,
  the participation rate for those who were contacted and eligible was 78.7 and 48.2
  % in AA cases and controls, respectively, and 79 and 49 % in Caucasian cases and
  controls, respectively. Participation rates for the NJ site were higher  than those
  for NY, but the participation rates of cases and controls in each site for each
  race were similar. A total of 827 AA cases, 905 AA controls, 772 Caucasian cases,
  and 715 Caucasian controls participated in the study, and over 97 % of the participants
  completed the FFQ resulting in a total of 803 AA cases, 889 AA controls, 755 Caucasian
  cases, and 701 Caucasian controls available for analyses. Informed consent was obtained
  from all participants to collect and analyze data and to publish findings in aggregate.
  The study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards at the University of Medicine
  and Dentistry of New Jersey, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, and Roswell Park Cancer
  Institute.\n\nThe distribution of selected categorical variables  for AA and Caucasian
  cases and controls was summarized using frequencies and proportions. Chi-square
  tests were used to compare the differences in proportions between cases and controls
  for AA and Caucasian women separately. Red meat and poultry intakes were expressed
  as a density measure as grams per day for every 1,000 kcal of total energy intake
  for inclusion in the model that also adjusted for total energy intake as per the
  multivariate nutrient density method. The density measures for each food group were
  categorized into quartiles based on distribution among all controls with the fourth
  quartile representing the highest level of consumption. Using race-specific percentiles
  did not substantially change the casecontrol distribution for the food groups. Hence,
  to ease direct comparison of results across both races, we maintained the percentile
  cut-points computed based on distribution from all controls.\n\nUnconditional logistic
  regression analyses were used to compute odds ratios  and 95 % confidence intervals.
  Tests for linear trend were conducted by including the median intake in each quartile
  as a continuous variable in regression models. Subgroup analyses included further
  stratification by menopausal status. Polytomous logistic regression was used to
  simultaneously model risk of ER-positive and ER-negative tumors with controls as
  the reference. Tests of heterogeneity of odds ratios for stratified and polytomous
  models were computed using the Wald test. We also conducted case-only analyses to
  model risk of ER-negative tumors.\n\nPotential confounders of interest that were
  included in multivariable models were age, ethnicity, country of origin, education,
  age at menarche, age at menopause, menopausal status, parity, age at first birth,
  breast-feeding status, history of benign breast disease, family history of breast
  cancer, hormone replacement therapy  use, oral contraceptive use, body mass index,
  and total energy intake.\n\nIn sensitivity analyses, we repeated regression analyses
  after further adjustment for total fat intake  and alcohol. We also further evaluated
  whether associations differed when excluding AA community controls, noninvasive
  cases, HRT users, and participants with total energy intake of ;500 calories or
  more than 4,500 calories. Finally, we repeated analyses also adjusting for fruits
  and vegetables as potential confounders.\n\nThe distribution of demographic and
  socioeconomic characteristics, as well as potential risk factors for breast cancer
  in the entire study population, stratified by race is summarized in Table 1. Overall,
  Caucasian women tended to have higher education and were less likely to be obese
  than AA women. As compared to AA and Caucasian controls, both AA and Caucasian cases
  were more likely to have ever used HRT, have a history of benign breast disease,
  and family history of breast cancer. Consistent with the literature, a higher percentage
  of AA cases were diagnosed at stage 2 or higher and with ER-negative tumors. Unprocessed
  red meat intake was higher in Caucasian than in AA women, while the opposite was
  true for processed meat and poultry consumption.\n\nDistribution of selected characteristics
  for breast cancer among women participating in WCHS, n = 3148  \n\nTables 2 and
  3 show associations between meat consumption and breast cancer risk among Caucasian
  women, also stratified by menopausal status and ER status. Among Caucasian women
  overall, consuming processed meat appeared to increase breast cancer risk, when
  comparing the highest quartile to the lowest. Similar associations were noted for
  unprocessed red meat  and poultry consumption, although a significant linear trend
  was only noted for poultry intake. Associations with consumption of processed meat
  were stronger among postmenopausal Caucasian women, while among premenopausal women,
  risk was significantly increased with higher unprocessed red meat  and poultry intakes.
  However, significant heterogeneity in odds ratios across menopausal status was only
  observed for associations with poultry intake.\n\nRed meat and poultry intake, and
  breast cancer risk among Caucasian women by menopausal status  \n\nOdds ratios are
  adjusted for age, ethnicity, country of origin, education, age at menarche, menopausal
  status, age at menopause, parity, age at first birth, breast-feeding status, family
  history of breast cancer, OC use, history of benign breast disease, HRT use, total
  energy intake, BMI\n\nRed meat and poultry intake and breast cancer risk among Caucasian
  women by hormone receptor status  \n\nOdds ratios are adjusted for age, ethnicity,
  country of origin, education, age at menarche, menopausal status, parity, age at
  first birth, breast-feeding status, family history of breast cancer, OC use, history
  of benign breast disease, HRT use, total energy intake, BMI\n\nWhen stratifying
  by ER status among Caucasian women, there were no marked differences in risk associated
  with consumption of red meat although a significant association was observed for
  increased risk of ER-positive tumors, with a significant linear trend. The magnitude
  of associations with processed meat were stronger for ER-negative tumors  while
  consuming unprocessed red meat in the highest quartile increased risk of ER-positive
  tumors, but numbers in these cells were relatively small and tests for heterogeneity
  of odds ratios across the two ER groups were not significant. Although there were
  no associations between poultry intake and ER-positive breast cancer, higher consumption
  was significantly associated with risk of ER-negative tumors, with a statistically
  significant p for heterogeneity. In case-only analyses, the increased risk of ER-negative
  tumors associated with poultry intake in the highest quartile remained.\n\nSimilar
  analyses for AA women are shown in Tables 4 and 5. In contrast to results observed
  in Caucasian women, there was no clear evidence of an association between red meat,
  poultry, and breast cancer risk in AA women overall or when stratified by menopausal
  status. When evaluating by ER status  or in case-only analyses in AA women, there
  were no significant associations observed except for a borderline increase in risk
  of ER-positive tumors associated with consuming processed meat  and a significant
  linear trend. None of the tests for heterogeneity of odds ratios were statistically
  significant.\n\nRed meat and poultry intake, and breast cancer risk among AA women
  by menopausal status  \n\nOdds ratios are adjusted for age, ethnicity, country of
  origin, education, age at menarche, menopausal status, age at menopause, parity,
  age at first birth, breast- feeding status, family history of breast cancer, OC
  use, history of benign breast disease, HRT use, total energy intake, BMI\n\nRed
  meat and poultry intake and breast cancer risk among AA women by hormone receptor
  status  \n\nOdds ratios are adjusted for age, ethnicity, country of origin, education,
  age at menarche, menopausal status, parity, age at first birth, breast-feeding status,
  family history of breast cancer, OC use, history of benign breast disease, HRT use,
  total energy\n\nOverall tests for heterogeneity to assess difference in odds ratios
  by race resulted in p values of 0.11 for total red meat, 0.39 for processed meat,
  0.08 for unprocessed red meat, and 0.27 for poultry. Mutual adjustment of processed
  meat, unprocessed red meat, and poultry did not meaningfully change odds ratios.
  Adjusting for fruit and vegetable intake did not alter any of the associations observed
  or direction of OR, with the only notable change being an attenuation of OR for
  processed meat in Caucasian postmenopausal women, and for unprocessed red meat among
  all Caucasian women. None of the results from sensitivity analyses altered study
  conclusions.\n\nIn this casecontrol study involving a large sample of AA and Caucasian
  women, a positive association between intake of processed and unprocessed red meat,
  poultry and breast cancer risk was limited to Caucasian women. To our knowledge,
  this is the first investigation of these foods and breast cancer risk in a study
  of both AA and Caucasian women with evaluation by menopause as well as ER status.
  Consumption of processed meat in the highest quartile appeared to be more strongly
  associated with postmenopausal breast cancer, while unprocessed red meat and poultry
  were strongly associated with premenopausal breast cancer in Caucasian women, but
  odds ratios across menopausal status were significantly different only for poultry
  intake. Similarly, poultry consumption appeared particularly harmful for ER-negative
  tumors among Caucasian women. Red meat intake in both processed and unprocessed
  forms increased breast cancer risk in Caucasian women regardless of hormone receptor
  status, albeit not all risk estimates reached statistical significance. Among AA
  women, there was no strong evidence relating red meat and poultry intake to breast
  cancer risk except for a significant positive linear trend between consuming processed
  meat and ER-positive tumors.\n\nResults from past studies that have investigated
  the impact of red and processed meats on breast cancer risk are inconsistent and
  have largely involved only Caucasian women. No significant association between consumption
  of total meat and red meat and breast cancer risk was observed in the Pooling Project
  \ or in the EPIC cohort  for red and processed meat. In contrast, increased breast
  cancer risks associated with consumption of processed meat, red meat, or total red
  meat combining both processed and unprocessed meat  have been observed, similar
  to findings in Caucasian women in our study. Among AA women, the null findings are
  consistent with the only other study on this topic, the Black Womens Health Study,
  which also found no association between any meat type and breast cancer risk in
  AA women even when stratified by menopausal and hormone receptor status. However,
  in our study, a significant linear trend was observed for consumption of processed
  meat and ER-positive tumors among AA women, but the odds ratios were not significantly
  different by hormone receptor status.\n\nRacial differences in the association between
  diet and cancer risk have been observed for other cancer sites. For example, a high
  fat/meat/potatoes pattern appeared to increase risk of rectal cancer only in Caucasians
  and not in AA despite the pattern being observed in both race groups. A fruitvegetable
  pattern was significantly associated with reduced colon cancer risk only in Caucasians
  in the North Carolina Colon Cancer Study. In our study, the overall test for heterogeneity
  by race was borderline significant only for fresh red meat intake  despite stronger
  associations in Caucasian women for red meat and poultry consumption. Hence, further
  evaluation by menopausal and hormone receptor status was conducted.\n\nIt has been
  postulated that similar to risk factors such as adiposity, diet in early life may
  have a different impact on breast cancer risk than diet in later ages, thus indicating
  potential modification of risks by menopausal status. A meta-analysis  of 10 studies
  that investigated the impact of red meat consumption and breast cancer risk focusing
  on premenopausal women observed a summary relative risk of 1.24. In our study, although
  risk estimates for processed meat were stronger in postmenopausal Caucasian women,
  in general, associations for total red meat were similar in pre- and postmenopausal
  Caucasian women, which were also confirmed by tests of heterogeneity. This is consistent
  with findings from the UK Womens Cohort Study  that reported highest risk for highest
  red meat eaters  in both pre- and postmenopausal groups, with stronger estimates
  in postmenopausal women, in addition to a Canadian study reporting an elevated breast
  cancer risk among postmenopausal women with consumption of total meat and processed
  meat.\n\nFurther research has been proposed to also investigate the association
  between consumption of red meat and breast cancer specifically stratified by hormone
  receptor status. Previous studies that evaluated all red meat intake and breast
  cancer risk stratified by receptor status have observed stronger associations for
  hormone-receptor-positive tumors than for hormone-receptor-negative tumors. In our
  study, although total red meat was associated with increased risk of ER-positive
  tumors among Caucasian women, processed meat appeared to be more strongly related
  to increased risk of ER-negative tumors. However, tests for heterogeneity of odds
  ratios suggested no significant difference in the associations by hormone receptor
  status. Recent results from the Shanghai Breast Cancer Study reported elevated breast
  cancer risk for all types of meat regardless of hormone receptor status. These findings
  could indicate presence of both estrogenic and non-estrogenic pathways involving
  meat and carcinogenesis.\n\nThere are several potential mechanisms for the role
  of red meat in the carcinogenesis process. Nitrites that are used to preserve processed
  meats undergo chemical reactions endogenously to form nitrosamines, also a mutagen
  and probable carcinogen. Cooking red meat at high temperatures  lead to the production
  of heterocyclic amines  and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which are mutagens
  and suspected carcinogens. HCA content of cooked meat has shown to directly relate
  to increases in cooking temperature. A 4.6-fold increased risk of breast cancer
  was observed among postmenopausal women who consistently ate well-done red meat
  in the Iowa Womens Health Study. Results from the Nashville Breast Health Study
  also showed stronger risk for high intake of well-done red meat in both pre- and
  postmenopausal women. A past report  from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance
  System observed a much higher percentage of Caucasian respondents reporting consumption
  of pink hamburgers compared with AA respondents in both NY  and NJ, which could
  indicate increased susceptibility of carcinogens for AA women. However, there is
  also some evidence that the impact of well-done meat on breast cancer risk could
  be modified by certain polymorphisms in the NAT1, NAT2, GSTM1, GSTT1, and SULT1A1
  genes that encode enzymes involved in HCA activation or detoxification. In fact,
  a casecontrol study  nested in an Iowa cohort of postmenopausal women observed a
  3.4-fold greater breast cancer risk among women who consumed well-done or very well
  done meat compared to consuming meat that was rare or medium, and who carried a
  null GSTM1 or GSTT1 genotype. Interestingly, Caucasians appear to have a much higher
  frequency of a null GSTM1 or GSTT1 gene than AA. Hence, it is possible that there
  are potential racial differences in geneenvironment interactions, resulting in differences
  in the way animal foods and other potential carcinogens are metabolized and their
  consequential impact on breast tissue.\n\nOther plausible mechanisms include potential
  estrogenic effects of HCAs shown in animal studies, thus resulting in possible stimulation
  of ER and PR gene expression. Furthermore, heme iron present in red meat and responsible
  for its dark red color could have a catalytic effect on endogenous formation of
  nitrosamines  and has been shown to promote estrogen-induced tumors. Exposure to
  meat-derived mutagens has also been observed to be significantly correlated with
  DNA adducts in breast tissue, potentially leading to unrepaired DNA damage and carcinogenesis.
  A cross-sectional analysis found mean plasma concentrations of sex-hormone-binding
  globulin  to be lower with higher intakes of total and fresh red meat. Lower SHBG
  levels correspond with increased bioavailability of estradiol. Finally, there is
  evidence linking exogenous hormone treatment of beef cattle to increased risk of
  estrogen-related illnesses even with low levels of exposure in the long term.\n\nIn
  our study, there was also a positive association between poultry consumption and
  breast cancer risk in Caucasian women, with over twofold greater risk among premenopausal
  Caucasian women and among women with ER-negative tumors, most commonly seen among
  premenopausal women. Past evidence relating poultry intake and breast cancer risk
  is inconclusive. A recent cross-sectional study reported that intake of chicken,
  high-fat dairy products, and animal fat may be important determinants of oxidative
  stress in women with breast cancer, and increased breast cancer risk with high poultry
  consumption was also reported in the Shanghai Breast Cancer Study. The null findings
  in AA women related to poultry consumption are consistent with results from the
  Black Womens Health Study.\n\nBiological mechanisms for the role of white meat in
  the cancer process involve HCAs  and the potential influence of fat in the meat
  supplemented by meal preparation methods such as frying. Adjusting for fat did not
  have a major impact on study results. We also repeated analyses adjusting for red
  meat, but the findings for poultry intake remained unchanged. The largest proportion
  \ of mean dietary intake of total HCAs in the USA appears to be comprised of 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo
  \ pyridine, with AA consuming more than Caucasians, which has been attributed to
  higher intake of chicken and pan-fried meats. High PhIP concentrations in well-done
  chicken and beef have also been shown in other studies. However, results from the
  Nashville Breast Health Study on chicken consumption and breast cancer risk were
  null, and even when poultry consumption was high, there was no correlation between
  cooking poultry at high temperatures and formation of DNA adducts in breast tissue.
  The null findings in AA women in our study, despite higher poultry intake levels
  warrants further investigation into potential racial differences in biological pathways
  involving PhIP metabolism. Nevertheless, findings may have occurred due to chance
  and need replication in view of potential biases described herein.\n\nLimitations
  of this study include lack of information on meat doneness levels that precluded
  assessment of risks associated with different cooking methods. This study could
  have been affected by inherent limitations of the casecontrol study design such
  as recall and selection bias. For instance, cases could have changed their dietary
  habits as a result of the cancer diagnosis and report recent behavior instead of
  recalling behavior prior to diagnosis. To evaluate the extent of this bias, we evaluated
  behavioral change after diagnosis. A greater proportion of both AA and Caucasian
  cases reported that they had decreased meat intake and chicken intake since diagnosis
  than controls. However, this only suggests that we may be underestimating the association
  with meat and poultry consumption.\n\nTo further assess if there were racial differences
  in recall, we also compared the proportion of AA and Caucasian cases and controls
  who had increased or decreased meat and chicken intake since the reference date.
  Although a higher proportion of cases in both races had decreased meat intake and
  chicken intake since diagnosis as compared to controls, the differences in proportions
  were similar in AA and Caucasian women. Self-reported dietary data have also been
  used to assess racial differences in nutrition by other studies. The low response
  rates, especially among controls in our study, could result in potential selection
  bias, but response rates as low as 50 % are not uncommon in population studies.
  Finally, to evaluate selection bias resulting from possible differences by source
  of controls, we repeated analyses after excluding AA community controls, but results
  did not change.\n\nThe major strength of this study is the large sample of AA women
  that allowed subgroup analyses to further evaluate associations by menopausal status
  and hormone receptor status in each race. Extensive collection of all major and
  potential risk factors as well as in-person interviews to collect detailed dietary
  data enabled accounting for potential confounding to a large extent.\n\nThis study
  supports an association between processed and unprocessed red meat, poultry meat
  consumption and increased breast cancer risk in Caucasian women. Although heterogeneity
  tests across race, menopausal status, and hormone receptor status subgroups confirmed
  differences only for poultry intake, magnitude of associations appeared stronger
  in certain subgroups, which may be obscured if studies do not stratify but only
  adjust for these factors. As this is one of the first studies to examine red meat
  and poultry consumption and breast cancer risk in AA women, further research is
  needed to make more definitive conclusions in this minority population while taking
  into account cultural preferences for cooking methods and meat doneness levels.\n\nThis
