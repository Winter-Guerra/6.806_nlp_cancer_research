  Brazilian autumnal propolis shows anti-angiogenic activity An in vitro and in vivo
  study.md
text: '


  The present study focuses on the effects of a hydro-alcoholic propolis extract collected
  in autumn  in Santa Catarina State, on the angiogenesis, using in vitro and in vivo
  models. Cultures of human umbilical vein endothelial cells were used to assess the
  effects of propolis on viability, proliferation, and cell migration, as well as
  capillary tube formation. The propolis autumnal extracts significantly decreased
  the cell viability, based on CC50 values, which decreased  from 297 to 130 g/ml
  in 24 h and 72 h of treatment, respectively. The process of cell proliferation was
  decreased by 81.7 to 48.4% due to exposure  to 130-180 g/ml of propolis extract,
  as compared with control. In these same concentrations, the cell migration was also
  reduced by 39.6 to 12.6%, respectively. Furthermore, autumnal propolis extract  inhibited
  the tube-like structure formation  of endothelial cells on Matrigel. The treatments
  performed in vivo with administration of 450 mg propolis.kg 1 inhibited both angiogenesis
  and vasculogenesis by 82.3 and 66.5% in the chorioallantoic and yolk-sac membranes
  of chick embryos. Furthermore, by means of UV-vis-spectrophotometry, reverse phase-high
  performance liquid chromatography analysis and 1D and 2D-nuclear magnetic resonance
  experiments reveal higher contents of flavonoids and total phenolic compounds with
  predominance of the flavonol quercetin and the phenolic acids, e.g., gallic acid,
  protocatechuic acid and chlorogenic acid in the propolis hydro-alcoholic extract.
  Our findings related to the anti-proliferative, anti-migration, and anti-tubulogenic
  actions on human umbilical vein endothelial cell line agree with the inhibitory
  effects in the in vivo vessel formation exerted by propolis extract under study.
  The results also suggest that autumnal propolis extract might be potentially instrumental
  in providing alternative tools for angiogenic disease therapeutics.'
