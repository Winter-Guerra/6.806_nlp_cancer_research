  Activity of Selected Seaweeds Against HeLa K-562 and MDA-MB Cell Lines.md
text: "\n\nAnticancer activity of marine macro algae  Sargassum wightii, Ulva fasciata
  and Gracillaria corticata against HeLa, K-562 and MDA-MB cell lines was studied.
  During the present investigation crude extracts of seaweeds were prepared using
  soxhlet apparatus. Hexane, Butanol and Methanol were used as solvents. Crude extracts
  were dissolved in DMSO. In vitro anticancer activity of seaweeds at various concentrations
  \ was studied against the chosen cell lines using MTT assay -2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
  bromide, a yellow tetrazole). Butanolic extract of Gracillaria corticata  has shown
  greater anticancer activity than hexane and methanolic extracts of G. corticata
  and butanol, hexane and methanolic extracts of Sargassum wightii and Ulva fasciata.\n\nCancer
  is one of the most dreaded diseases accounting for death of more than 3,500 people
  per million population around the world. Although Chemotherapy is the best option
  available for the treatment of cancer, its severe side effects cannot be ignored.
  This has necessitated the search for alternative anticancer drugs having better
  efficacy with minimum side effects. This search turned the focus towards the marine
  macro algae which are tremendous reserve sources of pharmacologically efficient
  compounds.\n\nMarine macro algae, the seaweeds, constitute significant proportion
  of plant biomass of the marine ecosystem and reside at the intertidal zone, which
  is highly dynamic in nature. Till date, more than 2,400 marine bioactive compounds
  have been isolated from the seaweeds of subtropical and tropical populations. Recent
  studies reveal that they possess antiviral, antibacterial, antifungal and antitumor
  activity. Depending on the pigments seaweeds are broadly classified into chlorophyta,
  pheophyta and rhodophyta. The seaweeds Sargassum wightii, Ulva fasciata and Gracillaria
  corticata, belonging to the family pheophyceae, chlorophyceae and rhodophyceae respectively
  were tested for their anticancer activity. Crude extracts of the above three seaweeds
  prepared in hexane, butanol and methanol were used against HeLa-2, K-562  and MDA-MB-231
  \ cell lines using MTT assay during the investigation.\n\nRao and Sreeramulu  described
  the seaweeds of Visakhapatnam coast. Selected sea weeds were procured from the intertidal
  region of Bay of Bengal at Visakhapatnam, and the samples were identified by following
  the standard procedure. They were brought to the laboratory in polythene bags and
  thoroughly cleaned with sea water followed by distilled water to remove sand, salt
  and epiphytes. Samples were shade dried and coarse powdered.\n\nSample and the solvents
  were taken in 1:10 ratio and soxhaltion had been performed by using hexane, butanol
  and methanol. Crude extracts were concentrated by rotary evaporator at 4550 C. The
  resulting extracts were dissolved in Di Methyl Sulphoxide  and kept in freezer for
  further use.\n\nHeLa, K-562 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines were purchased from National
  Council for Cell Sciences  Pune. Cell lines were re-suspended in Minimum Essential
  Medium  medium and culture flasks were incubated in 5 % CO2 incubator at 37 C for
  23 days.\n\nAbove three cell lines were added into 96 wells plate at a concentration
  of 2  104 cells/ml and to each well 20 l of MEM was added. The plates were incubated
  over night in 5 % CO2 incubator at 37 C. Algal crude extracts of different concentrations
  of 12.5, 25, 50, 100, 200 g/ml were prepared in DMSO. The cell lines were treated
  with 50 l of the algal crude extracts of above different concentrations. Blank well
  had only media. Control cell lines were run without addition of crude extracts.
  All the plates were incubated for 24 h. After incubation 20 l of freshly prepared
  MTT solution  was added in each well and incubated for 4 h to allow the MTT to be
  metabolized. Media was discarded after incubation. Formozan  that was left in the
  well was re-suspended in 200 l DMSO. The plates were placed on a shaking table at
  150 rpm for 5 min for thorough mixing of Formozan into DMSO. The amount of MTT-Formozan
  that is directly proportional to the number of living cells was determined by reading
  the optical density  at 420 nm.\n\nResults of in vitro anticancer activity of hexane,
  butanol and methanolic extracts of S. wightii, U. fasciata and G. corticata against
  HeLa, K-562 and MDA-MB Cell Lines, are given in Tables 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3. The same
  are shown in Figs. 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3. Crude extracts showed increase in inhibition
  of cell lines  with increase of concentration. At minimal  concentration cell inhibition
  was observed to be below 10 %. At 50200 g/ml a 2050 % greater inhibition was noticed.
  Maximum inhibition was observed at 200 g/ml.\n\nPercentage of inhibition against
  HeLa cell lines by different concentrations of crude extracts of the three seaweeds
  \ \n\nPercentage of inhibition against MDA-MB 231 cell lines by different concentrations
  of crude extracts of the three seaweeds  \n\nPercentage of inhibition against K-562
  cell lines by different concentrations of crude extracts of the three seaweeds  \n\nButanolic,
  hexane and methanolic extracts of G. corticata and U. fasciata had shown more than
  50 % inhibition against MDA-MB 531. Butanol and hexane extracts of G. corticata
  have inhibited 50 % of K-562 and 40 % of HeLa cell line growth respectively. Effect
  of S. wightii and U. fasciata is below 30 %.\n\nMarine environment is a source of
  potential bioactive compound. The green algae are known for their antibacterial,
  antiviral, antioxidative, and antiproliferative properties. In our observation also
  U. fasciata has shown 50 % cell inhibition against K-562 and MDA-MB 531 cell lines
  where as the inhibitory effect against HeLa cell lines is very low. Our data reveals
  that butanolic and hexane extracts of U. fasciata are found to be more effective
  against K-562 while methanolic extract is effective against the MDA-MB 531 cell
  lines.\n\nBrown algae which possesses sulphated polysaccharides  and fucosidian
  are very good source of anticoagulant, antibacterial and antioxidant as well as
  antitumourogenic compounds. Different organic and aqueous extracts of Sargassum
  sp. were reported for their anticancer properties. Present data showed that Butanolic
  and methanolic extracts of S. wightii are effective against K-562 and MDA-MB 531
  cell lines. Hexane extract has shown the minimum cytotoxicity. The compounds which
  are responsible for biological activity might be moderate polar in nature.\n\nEarlier
  reports show that Gracillaria sp. ethanolic, chloroform and aqueous extracts inhibited
  cell viability. In our study G. corticata organic solvent extracts also inhibited
  more than 50 % of the cell proliferation of HeLa, K-562, and MDA-MB 531 cell lines.\n\nReactive
  oxygen species  may be one of the causative agents of cancer that damages DNA leading
  to mutagenesis. Antioxidants are the compounds which scavenge ROS. Previous literature
  suggests the presence of poly phenols, carotenoids, sulfated polysaccharides, terpenoids,
  flavonoids, phycocolloids, alkaloids, sterols  in marine algae which act as the
  potent source of antioxidants. In our studies Gracillaria corticata has been the
  most effective inhibitor of cancer cell lines. Therefore Gracillaria corticata may
  be containing the above substances which are nonpolar and moderate polar. Further
  investigation has to be done to identify, isolate, and evaluate the specific compounds
  which are responsible for anticancer activity and in vivo studies have to be carried
  out to check their cytotoxicity on normal cells.\n\nThe first author thanks the
