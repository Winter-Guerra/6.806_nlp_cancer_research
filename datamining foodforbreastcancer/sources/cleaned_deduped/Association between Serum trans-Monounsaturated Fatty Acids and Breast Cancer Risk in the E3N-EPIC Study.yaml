text: "\n\nThe authors assessed the association between serum phospholipid fatty acids
  as biomarkers of fatty acid intake and breast cancer risk among women in the E3N
  Study, the French component of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer
  and Nutrition. During an average of 7 years of follow-up, 363 cases of incident
  invasive breast cancer were documented among 19,934 women who, at baseline, had
  completed a diet history questionnaire and provided serum samples. Controls were
  randomly matched to cases by age, menopausal status at blood collection, fasting
  status at blood collection, date, and collection center. Serum phospholipid fatty
  acid composition was assessed by gas chromatography. Adjusted odds ratios for risk
  of breast cancer with increasing levels of fatty acids were calculated using conditional
  logistic regression. An increased risk of breast cancer was associated with increasing
  levels of the trans-monounsaturated fatty acids palmitoleic acid and elaidic acid.
  cis-Monounsaturated fatty acids were unrelated to breast cancer risk. A high serum
  level of trans-monounsaturated fatty acids, presumably reflecting a high intake
  of industrially processed foods, is probably one factor contributing to increased
  risk of invasive breast cancer in women. \n\nBreast cancer incidence is the highest
  among womens malignancies in Western Europe and North America, and incidence is
  rapidly increasing in Japan. Much controversy has surrounded the hypothesis that
  a high intake of fat increases the risk of breast cancer. Results of intervention
  trials have suggested a modest beneficial effect of a reduction in total fat intake
  on breast cancer incidence  and recurrence. Case-control studies have generally
  shown a positive association between total fat consumption and the incidence of
  breast cancer, while pooled cohort data have shown no relation. Nevertheless, some
  studies have suggested that a high intake of cis-monounsaturated oleic acid  or
  n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids   could reduce breast cancer risk. Conversely, a
  high intake of trans-unsaturated fatty acids  and n-6 PUFAs  could increase the
  risk of postmenopausal breast cancer. \n\nEpidemiologic studies are limited by their
  assessment of nutrition through food frequency questionnaires, a method shown to
  be prone to measurement error. Moreover, the conversion of quantities of food items
  consumed into their fatty acid content is exceptionally complex, for numerous reasons
  related to the imprecision of qualitative and quantitative estimates of fat in food.
  The fatty acid composition of a given food can vary according to cooking methods
  and industry supply, and food composition tables are incomplete. \n\nIn contrast,
  biomarkers of dietary fatty acids offer objective, qualitative measures of bioavailable
  amounts of these nutrients irrespective of the source and quality of food, particularly
  for fatty acids that are not endogenously synthesized. We investigated the relation
  between serum phospholipid fatty acid levels as biomarkers of past dietary fatty
  acid intake and breast cancer risk in a large French cohort study, the E3N Study.
  This cohort study is the French component of the European Prospective Investigation
  into Cancer and Nutrition. We hypothesized a negative association between oleic
  acid, n-3 PUFAs, and breast cancer risk and a positive association with n-6 PUFAs
  and trans-fatty acids. \n\nThe E3N Study is an ongoing prospective study that was
  designed to examine associations between cancer risk and dietary, lifestyle, and
  reproductive factors in women. The E3N cohort comprises female members of a national
  health insurance scheme covering teachers in the French education system and their
  spouses. Overall, 98,995 female volunteers aged 4065 years were enrolled between
  February 1989 and November 1991 after replying to a baseline questionnaire and giving
  their written informed consent. The study was approved by the French National Commission
  for Data Protection and Privacy. In the baseline questionnaire and subsequent self-administered
  questionnaires, participants provided information on anthropometric characteristics,
  reproductive history, health status, lifetime use of hormonal treatments, family
  history of breast cancer, and smoking status. Usual diet was assessed through a
  validated 208-item diet history questionnaire sent out between June 1993 and June
  1995. The response rate for the dietary questionnaire was 81 percent of the total
  cohort at baseline. Responders to the dietary questionnaire constituted the French
  component of EPIC. Following a common protocol, blood samples were collected, aliquotted
  into plasma, serum, lymphocytes, and erythrocytes, and stored in liquid nitrogen.
  In France, approximately 25,000 E3N participants volunteered for blood collection
  between 1995 and 1998. Along with blood samples, information on fasting, smoking,
  use of medication in the preceding 12 hours, and menopausal status was collected.
  Body mass index was calculated as measured weight  divided by the square of height.
  \n\nFollow-up questionnaires were sent biennially to ascertain whether participants
  had been diagnosed with any of various diseases and to update data on medication
  use, menopausal status, and lifestyle factors. When a diagnosis of breast cancer
  was reported, we examined the relevant medical records and obtained medical records
  from the attending physicians. \n\nFor this analysis, we designed a case-control
  study nested within the E3N-EPIC cohort among women who completed the dietary questionnaire
  and provided serum samples. Among them, we selected those with available information
  on age at blood collection, date of collection, center of collection, menopausal
  status at collection, and fasting status at collection, which left us with a subcohort
  of 17,540 subjects. During a follow-up period of up to 7 years from blood collection,
  until July 2002, we identified 384 cases of incident invasive breast cancer. Controls
  \ were randomly selected among subjects who were free of cancer until the date of
  diagnosis of their matched case. Two controls per case were matched on age, menopausal
  status  at blood collection, fasting status  at blood collection, study center,
  and date of blood collection. \n\nSerum samples were divided into batches of nine
  blinded samples corresponding to samples from three cases and their matched controls
  in random order. Total lipids were extracted from serum samples  with chloroform-methanol
  2:1  containing antioxidant butylated hydroxytoluene and L-A-phosphatidylcholine-dimyristoyl-d54
  \ as an internal standard. Phospholipids were purified by adsorption chromatography.
  Fatty acid methyl esters were formed by transmethylation with Methyl-Prep II. Analyses
  were carried out on a 6890N gas chromatograph. A BPX70 capillary column was used
  for separation of fatty acid methyl esters. The relative amount of each fatty acid,
  expressed as a percentage of total fatty acids, was quantified by integrating the
  area under the peak and dividing the result by the total area. Fatty acids were
  also expressed as absolute concentrations in serum  based on the quantity of the
  methyl deuterated internal standard. \n\nFor quality control, we added one aliquot
  of the same serum sample to each batch of nine samples analyzed over 77 days and
  assessed between-batch reproducibility. As expressed in percentage of total fatty
  acids, coefficients of variation for major fatty acids were 6.63 percent for 15:0,
  5.36 percent for 17:0, 0.75 percent for 16:0, 1.04 percent for 18:0, 0.67 percent
  for cis-18:1n-9, 8.98 percent for trans-monounsaturated fatty acids, 0.74 percent
  for 18:2n-6, 1.10 percent for 20:4n-6, 10.51 percent for 18:3n-3, 2.54 percent for
  20:5n-3, and 1.48 percent for 22:6n-3. \n\nOf the 1,152 selected participants, eight
  serum samples  could not be retrieved from the blood repository. Thirty samples
  were oxidized. We further excluded 10 cases for which we obtained later histologic
  reports indicating that they had in situ noninvasive breast cancer and one control
  who did not answer any questionnaire after her blood collection. As a consequence,
  some triplets of one case and the two corresponding controls were incomplete; we
  excluded those in which only the case  or only the two controls  remained. This
  left 363 cases and 702 matched controls. Moreover, the definition of menopausal
  status was revised after controls were selected; when we excluded controls who did
  not match their reference cases menopausal status at blood collection and/or cases
  for whom neither control was of the same menopausal status, the study population
  was restricted to 349 cases and 645 matched controls. Results for the larger population
  \ were similar to those for the restricted population, so we present results for
  the larger group. Baseline characteristics of cases and controls were compared using
  univariate logistic regression stratified by triplet. \n\nUsing values for the 40
  individual fatty acids, we calculated the serum content of the following seven groups
  of fatty acids: saturated fatty acids, total monounsaturated fatty acids, trans-MUFAs,
  long-chain n-6 PUFAs, total n-6 PUFAs, long-chain n-3 PUFAs, and total n-3 PUFAs.
  We calculated the ratios of 18:2n-6  to 18:3n-3, long-chain n-6 PUFAs to long-chain
  n-3 PUFAs, and total n-6 PUFAs to total n-3 PUFAs. We also determined the saturation
  index  as the ratio of stearic acid to oleic acid  and the ratio of palmitic acid
  to palmitoleic acid. The SI is an indicator of activity of the rate-limiting enzyme
  delta-9 desaturase, which transforms palmitic acid and stearic acid into the MUFAs
  palmitoleic acid and oleic acid, respectively. For analysis, serum phospholipid
  fatty acids and SIs were divided into quintiles based on the distribution among
  controls. \n\nOdds ratios and 95 percent confidence intervals were estimated using
  conditional logistic regression matched on the triplets constituted by a case and
  her two controls. We selected a parsimonious multivariate model by including variables
  which were statistically significantly associated with breast cancer risk  and which
  changed the risk estimates for at least one of the major fatty acids by 10 percent
  or more. The final parsimonious model was adjusted for years of education, body
  mass index at blood collection, adult height, menopausal hormone use before or at
  blood collection, alcohol consumption at the time the dietary questionnaire was
  completed, age at first birth and parity combined, family history of breast cancer
  in first-degree relatives, and personal history of benign breast disease. Tests
  for linear trend across quintiles of phospholipid fatty acids were performed using
  the median level in each quintile. SAS statistical software  was used for all analyses.
  All statistical tests were two-sided; p values of less than 0.05 were considered
  statistically significant. \n\nBody mass index, age at menarche, age at menopause,
  and smoking status did not differ between cases and controls. However, greater proportions
  of taller women, women with higher education, nulliparous women, women who first
  gave birth after age 30 years, postmenopausal women using menopausal hormones, and
  women with a personal history of benign breast disease or a familial history of
  breast cancer were found among cases than among controls. \n\nBaseline characteristics
  of control and case subjects in the E3N-EPIC Study, France, 19951998\n\nPalmitic
  acid was the prevailing saturated fatty acid in serum phospholipids, while oleic
  acid was the major MUFA. Among PUFAs, linoleic acid was the most common fatty acid,
  and it constituted approximately one fifth of the total. Our chromatographic method
  allowed us to distinguish the trans-MUFAs palmitoleic acid and elaidic acid from
  cis-palmitoleic acid and oleic acid without any overlapping. Other trans-MUFAs,
  such as vaccenic acid, were eluted with oleic acid. Trans-linoleic acid was clearly
  separated from cis-linoleic acid. \n\nMean serum concentrations of phospholipid
  fatty acids at baseline among control and case subjects in the E3N-EPIC Study, France,
  19951998 \n\nTable 3 shows odds ratios for breast cancer by quintile of serum phopholipid
  fatty acids, expressed as a percentage of total fatty acids. No statistically significant
  association with breast cancer risk was found for individual or total saturated
  fatty acids, individual or total MUFAs, linoleic acid, long-chain or total n-6 PUFAs,
  -linolenic acid, or long-chain or total n-3 PUFAs. The SIn-7that is, the ratio between
  palmitic acid and palmitoleic acid was inversely associated with breast cancer risk
  \ = 0.66, 95 percent confidence interval : 0.41, 1.05; p for trend = 0.031). The
  SIn-9 was also inversely associated  with breast cancer risk. Similar results were
  found with quintiles of serum fatty acids expressed as mol/liter. \n\nOdd ratios
  for breast cancer according to quintile of serum phospholipid fatty acids  in the
  E3N-EPIC Study, France, 19951998 \n\nTable 4 shows odds ratios for breast cancer
  by quintile of serum phopholipid trans\\- and cis-fatty acids, expressed as a percentage
  of total fatty acids. For total trans-MUFAs, the odds ratio for the highest quintile
  compared with the lowest was 1.75. We found an increased risk of breast cancer with
  increasing levels of trans-palmitoleic acid  and a trend with elaidic acid. Similar
  results were found when trans-MUFAs were expressed in mol/liter. We also observed
  a trend toward increased risk of breast cancer associated with increasing levels
  of trans-linoleic acid. No significant association was found with either cis-MUFAs,
  palmitoleic or oleic acids, or cis-linoleic acid. \n\nOdds ratios for breast cancer
  according to quintile of serum phospholipid cis\\- and trans-fatty acids  in the
  E3N-EPIC Study, France, 19951998 \n\nThe number of premenopausal breast cancer cases
  was too small  for separate examination of the association between serum phospholipid
  fatty acid levels and breast cancer risk. The results for postmenopausal breast
  cancer cases only were similar to those reported for the whole population. \n\nBased
  on this large analysis from the E3N-EPIC cohort, we found evidence that women with
  high serum levels of phospholipid trans-palmitoleic and elaidic acids had a risk
  of breast cancer that was increased 50 percent to twofold in comparison with women
  with low serum levels. As other cohort studies have found previously, we observed
  an inverse association between the saturation index and the risk of breast cancer,
  suggesting that a high ratio of saturated fat to monounsaturated fat may be associated
  with a reduced risk of breast cancer. \n\nTrans-fatty acids are unsaturated fatty
  acids with at least one double bond in the trans\\- configuration. Because humans
  do not synthesize trans-fatty acids, levels of these fatty acid isomers in serum
  depend on their availability in the diet. Trans-fatty acids occur naturally in fat
  from ruminant animal meat, milk, and dairy fat and unnaturally in industrially hardened
  vegetable oils. The prevailing isomer present in partially hydrogenated fats is
  elaidic acid, whereas the prevailing isomer in milk fat is vaccenic acid. Dietary
  exposure to partially hydrogenated vegetable oils occurs through consumption of
  margarine and such industrially processed foods as cakes, rolls, candies, cookies,
  chocolate, mayonnaise, potato chips, French fries, and fast foods. \n\nConcern about
  the adverse effects of trans-fatty acids from partially hydrogenated fats on cardiovascular
  disease risk has increased since the early 1990s. Limited data are available on
  the potential effect of trans-fatty acids on cancer risk. One of the major difficulties
  relates to the imprecision in estimating trans-fatty acid intake using dietary questionnaires
  and available nutrient databases. In addition to the limitations inherent in dietary
  assessment methods, nutrient databases are rather incomplete and of questionable
  accuracy with respect to the trans-fatty acid composition of foods. In particular,
  an average value may not adequately describe the trans-fatty acid content of a generic
  food item; indeed, there is evidence of wide variation in the trans-fatty acid content
  of individual foods within a single category. Thus, assessment of trans-fatty acid
  intakes by means of dietary questionnaires is likely to be hampered by substantial
  measurement error, which could mask relatively modest associations with cancer as
  compared with cardiovascular disease. \n\nIn this context, biomarkers may provide
  more reliable data on trans-MUFA levels in free-living populations. The fatty acid
  profile of serum, plasma, or erythrocyte membrane phospholipids has been described
  as reflecting medium-term  intakes of some fatty acids. In this population of E3N-EPIC
  women, despite a longer time lag between blood sampling and dietary assessments,
  serum levels of individual trans-palmitoleic and elaidic acids were significantly
  correlated with the consumption of manufactured foods   but were uncorrelated with
  dairy fat consumption  or meat intake. Moreover, our findings are consistent with
  an analysis of the different isomers of trans-MUFAs in processed foods containing
  partially hydrogenated vegetable oils commercialized in France in 19951996 and 1999,
  showing that elaidic acid was the major isomer present in industrially produced
  sandwiches, crackers, pizza, cakes, and pastries. In that study, formation of trans-palmitoleic
  acid has also been described to occur during the partial hydrogenation of vegetable
  oils, with a content in manufactured foods approximately 100 times lower than that
  of elaidic acid. Moreover, trans-palmitoleic acid has been shown to be present in
  beef tallow, so consumption of trans-palmitoleic acid may occur through exposure
  to foods containing beef tallow. Therefore, the correlation we observed is likely
  to reflect a contribution of manufactured foods to serum trans-palmitoleic and elaidic
  acids at the time of data collection. \n\nIn agreement with our finding of a direct
  relation between serum trans-MUFAs and breast cancer, an ecologic study  and a multicenter
  case-control study  previously showed that breast cancer incidence was positively
  associated with levels of trans-fatty acids in gluteal adipose tissue. Similarly,
  in another case-control study based on breast adipose tissue, an increased risk
  of breast cancer was associated with high levels of trans-palmitoleic acid and elaidic
  acid, while a decreased risk was associated with high levels of corresponding cis\\-
  isomers. In contrast, other biomarker-based case-control  or cohort  studies showed
  no evidence for a positive association between elaidic acid and breast cancer risk.
  This discrepancy may have resulted, in part, from the methods used for fatty acid
  analyses, which generally did not permit complete resolution of major trans-MUFAs.
  Our study had the advantage of combining wide dietary intake ranges and regional
  variability in the consumption of margarine, butter, and oil among French women
  \ with the use of chromatography permitting complete separation of trans-palmitoleic
  and elaidic acids resulting from industrial processes from trans\\- and cis-MUFAs
  obtained from alternative food sources. \n\nAlthough our study was limited by the
  inability to resolve vaccenic acid, the prevailing isomer in ruminant fat, we did
  not find an association between a high level of 15:0 in serum phospholipids, validated
  as a biomarker of dairy fat intake in our population study, and increased risk of
  breast cancer. These data might suggest that the source of trans-fatty acidsnatural
  foods versus processed foodsis a determinant of breast cancer risk. \n\nWe did not
  find any association between n-6 PUFAs and breast cancer risk as reported in most
  epidemiologic studies. Regarding putative protective fatty acids, we did not find
  any inverse association between n-3 long-chain PUFAs originating from fatty fish
  consumption and breast cancer risk. This finding is in agreement with most studies
  conducted in Western countries. In contrast, results from studies conducted in Asian
  populations have shown evidence of a protective effect of fish  and n-3 long-chain
  PUFAs against breast cancer risk. This discrepancy might be the consequence of higher
  dietary intakes of n-3 long-chain PUFAs in Asian populations as compared with Western
  populations. Specifically, in a prospective study conducted in Japan, the mean dietary
  intake of long-chain n-3 PUFAs in the highest quartile, associated with a halved
  risk, was estimated to reach 0.61 percent of energy. Similar high intakes were reported
  in a case-control study carried out in Japan, where the highest mean intake of long-chain
  n-3 PUFAs, associated with a halved risk, was estimated at more than 0.55 percent
  of energy. A substantially lower dietary intake of long-chain n-3 PUFAs was found
  in our French population, where the highest intake reached only 0.23 percent of
  energy. In this context, clear inverse associations may not have been observed in
  our population because n-3 PUFA intake was below the threshold for a protective
  effect against breast cancer risk. \n\nAlthough our findings share some consistency
  with those of previous studies, we cannot exclude the possibility of chance findings
  owing to the large number of tests performed. As in other observational studies,
  we cannot rule out the possibility that the associations we observed resulted from
  confounding bias, although we adjusted for known risk factors for breast cancer.
  In addition, cases and controls in this study came from a selected population of
  highly educated women who were willing to participate in both the dietary survey
  and blood collection. While this population was not representative of the general
  population, it is not clear how selection could have seriously affected the associations
  estimated in this study and other studies. \n\nOur findings show that trans-fatty
  acids presumably originating from industrial processes may increase the risk of
  invasive breast cancer. However, we might ask whether they are still relevant, because
  a decline in trans-fatty acid intake from margarines has occurred since 1996 in
  Europe. In Denmark, although the mean population intake of trans-fatty acids from
  hydrogenated fats fell to around 1 g per day in 2005, daily intakes exceeding 5
  g can still be easily reached by eating manufactured and fast-food products. Thus,
  our findings remain of topical interest, since the reduction in trans-fatty acids
  in margarines is likely to have been counterbalanced by increased consumption of
  readily available foods containing trans-fatty acids. For a comprehensive evaluation
  of the public health effect of trans-fatty acids, an assessment of trans-fatty acid
  levels in populations with diverse dietary practices is essential. Such a collaborative
  study will be undertaken in the large prospective EPIC cohort. \n\nThis study was
  based on data from the E3N cohort and was supported by grants from the Fondation
  de France and Fondation Carrefour. The E3N Study is being carried out with the financial
  support of the French League Against Cancer, the European Community, the 3M Company,
