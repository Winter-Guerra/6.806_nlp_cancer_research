  a bioactive flavonol attenuates allergic airway inflammation through negative regulation
  of NF-B.md
text: '


  Persistent activation of nuclear factor-B  has been associated with the development
  of asthma. Fisetin, a naturally occurring bioactive flavonol, has been shown to
  inhibit NF-B activity. We hypothesized that fisetin may attenuate allergic asthma
  via negative regulation of the NF-B activity. Female BALB/c mice sensitized and
  challenged with ovalbumin developed airway inflammation. Bronchoalveolar lavage
  fluid was assessed for total and differential cell counts, and cytokine and chemokine
  levels. Lung tissues were examined for cell infiltration and mucus hypersecretion,
  and the expression of inflammatory biomarkers. Airway hyperresponsiveness was monitored
  by direct airway resistance analysis. Fisetin dose-dependently inhibited ovalbumin-induced
  increases in total cell count, eosinophil count, and IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13 levels
  recovered in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. It attenuated ovalbumin-induced lung
  tissue eosinophilia and airway mucus production, mRNA expression of adhesion molecules,
  chitinase, IL-17, IL-33, Muc5ac and inducible nitric oxide synthase in lung tissues,
  and airway hyperresponsiveness to methacholine. Fisetin blocked NF-B subunit p65
  nuclear translocation and DNA-binding activity in the nuclear extracts from lung
  tissues of ovalbumin-challenged mice. In normal human bronchial epithelial cells,
  fisetin repressed TNF--induced NF-B-dependent reporter gene expression. Our findings
  implicate a potential therapeutic value of fisetin in the treatment of asthma through
  negative regulation of NF-B pathway.'
