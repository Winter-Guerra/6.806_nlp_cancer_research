  of metals Cd Cu Zn by the marine bivalves M galloprovincialis P radiata V verrucosa
  and C chione in Medi.md
text: "\n\nThe concentrations of Cd, Cu and Zn in both the whole soft tissue and separate
  organs  of wild bivalves  from three different coastal microenvironments of Greece
  were monitored from 2003 to 2004. In parallel, by employing appropriate analytical
  protocols for metal partitioning, the labile fraction of the metals was determined
  in the dissolved phase, suspended particulate matter and sediments. Differences
  in the metal levels were detected both among the study areas as well as among the
  bivalves examined. Significant bioaccumulation was demonstrated regarding Zn in
  M. galloprovincialis specimens from the highly industrialized Gulf of Elefsis and
  Cd in P. radiata and V. verrucosa from the Maliakos Gulf, which is influenced by
  extended agricultural activity occurring at the neighbouring area and a river outflow.
  Data of the metal levels in the various environmental phases were correlated with
  their concentrations in bivalves tissues. The clear relationships obtained in many
  cases among the labile metal concentrations and the bioaccumulated concentrations
  in bivalves point out that the labile fraction of a metal is the most bioavailable.
  The lack of positive correlation for C. chione confirms the occurrence of effective
  mechanisms of internal regulation of metal concentrations.\n\nAlthough their impact
  has no visible influence compared to other pollutants, heavy metals can cause long-term
  effects on ecosystems. The usefulness of bivalves as sentinel organisms in metal
  biomonitoring studies is widely recognized  as it is well known that they can accumulate
  ambient metals from the dissolved phase, their food and the ingestion of inorganic
  particulate material. In biomonitoring programmes, the primary objective is to relate
  the metal body contents of bivalves to the bioavailable levels found in the surrounding
  environment.\n\nDespite the numerous studies on bivalves, quantitative extrapolation
  of environmental exposures from body metal concentrations or vice versa still remains
  with lots of uncertainty. This is mainly due to several biological  and environmental
  factors  that influence the accumulation and concentrations of metals in bivalves
  tissues. Spatial heterogeneity with regard to the hydrogeochemical conditions and
  ecological factors precludes the generalization of metal uptake by organisms inhabiting
  even the neighbouring sites, permitting only few generalizations related to the
  studied element, the overall pollution of the location and the season.\n\nAlthough
  the total trace metal concentrations in the dissolved phase, the suspended particulate
  phase and the sediments provide a convenient measure of metal pollution, such measures
  do not necessarily predict the toxicity of these pollutants to aquatic animals.
  Within each phase, the organism is exposed to a variety of the physicochemical forms
  of each metal differing in their accessibility to the organism. Predicting the bioavailability
  of dissolved metals as a function of their speciation in the environment still remains
  an important goal in aquatic ecotoxicology. A key role is maintained by sediments
  which act as scavenging agents and an adsorptive sink for metals in aquatic environments.
  Bivalves exist either in direct contact with sediments or on rocks, exposed to fine
  sediments resuspended by wave action.\n\nThe accumulation of metals in specific
  organs of marine bivalves has been proposed as a sensitive and specific indicator
  of environmental contamination. The metal concentrations in specific organs of marine
  bivalves related to environmental exposure have only been examined in a few cases
  and rarely in native populations.\n\nHence, the aim of this paper was the simultaneous
  study of Cd, Cu and Zn concentrations in the tissues of four bivalves and of the
  partitioning of these metals in the dissolved phase, suspended particulate matter
  \ and sediments in order to seek out main patterns from the overall data set and
  specifically evaluate which species exhibits an association with environmental exposure.
  The metal content was measured in both the whole soft tissue and separate organs
  \ of wild specimens of the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis, the oyster Pinctada
  radiata and the clams Venus verrucosa and Callista chione, for the latest of which
  no data were found in the literature. The bivalves selected are among the most commonly
  marketed and frequently consumed in Greece and other Mediterranean countries. The
  work was carried out in three Mediterranean coastal systems constituting different
  typical microenvironments.\n\nSpecimens of the bivalves studied were obtained from
  five coastal sites located in three semi-enclosed gulfs of the Aegean Sea, selected
  to represent different physicochemical and geomorphological features and degrees
  of pollution:  The Gulf of Elefsis, which is an almost enclosed polluted area near
  Athens receiving industrial, commercial, transport and urban inputs. Two stations
  were sampled therein at the Loutropyrgos and Blue lagoon sites. These sites still
  sustain rich biodiversity and were selected to be far from direct discharges.  The
  Evoikos Gulf, which is an embayment influenced by strong tidal currents, a rare
  phenomenon in the Mediterranean. The two stations selected  are affected by the
  overall industrialization and urbanization of the northern  and the southern  sections
  of the gulf.  The Maliakos Gulf, which is an area receiving the runoff of an influenced
  agricultural area and the outflow of river Sperchios. Among the studied bivalves,
  specimens of M. galloprovincialis were not found at N. Artaki, of P. radiata at
  the Kalamos and Nea Artaki sites, of V. verrucosa at Blue lagoon and Kalamos, and
  of C. chione at the Blue lagoon and Molos sites. Bivalves and seawater samplings
  were performed by scuba diving in a total of four consecutive samplings. Sediment
  samples were collected in two samplings carried out in the winter and summer of
  2004. Seawater and sediment samplings are described in detail by Scoullos et al.
  \ and Sakellari et al., respectively.\n\nThe bivalves, with the size of mussels
  and clams being approximately 5 cm and that of oysters approximately 7 cm, were
  immediately transferred to the laboratory in plastic containers within a portable
  refrigerator. The bivalves were kept for 24 h in seawater taken from the same area
  in order to eliminate pseudofaeces.\n\nSoft tissues of five individuals of each
  species  were dissected, pooled, lyophilized, homogenized and stored in acid-washed
  glass vials at room temperature inside a desiccator until analysis. The length of
  each bivalve shell was measured to the nearest millimetre with Vernier calipers.
  The shells were dried for 48 h until constant weight was reached. Flesh condition
  index was calculated according to Lobel and Wright  as the dry flesh weight /dry
  shell weight.\n\nFor the determination of metals in four separate vital organs,
  20 specimens per site and sampling were collected, with the size of mussels and
  clams being approximately 5 cm and that of oysters approximately 7 cm. Dissection
  was performed directly after sampling in order to avoid redistribution of the metal
  content among individual organs. Pooled samples of soft tissues consisting of five
  individuals of each species  were treated as mentioned above.\n\nApproximately 0.5
  g of the dry sample accurately weighed was placed in Teflon holders especially designed
  for airtight sealing. A volume of 810 mL of nitric acid 65 % supra pure  was added
  and the samples digested overnight on a hot plate at 120 C and diluted with water
  of 18.2 M cm  to a final volume of 25 mL.\n\nDeterminations of the concentrations
  of both Cd and Cu were carried out using graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry
  \ with Zeeman background correction. Solutions of ammonium dihydrogen phosphate
  \ and magnesium nitrate 26H2O, 0.02 %, w/v; Merck) were used as matrix modifiers
  for cadmium, whereas palladium nitrate 2, 0.03 %, w/v; Merck) and magnesium nitrate
  26H2O, 0.02 %, w/v) were used for copper. The furnace operating conditions  employed
  were: for cadmium determinationsdrying: 85 C/5 s/0 s, 110 C/10 s/30 s, 130 C/5 s/5
  s; pyrolysis: 900 C/5 s/7 s; atomization: 1,800 C/0.8 s/4 s; cleaning: 2,200 C/2
  s/2 s; for copper determinationsdrying: 85 C/5 s/0 s, 95 C/40 s/0 s, 120 C/10 s/0
  s; pyrolysis: 800 C/5 s/6 s; atomization: 2,300 C/1.1 s/2.1 s; cleaning: 2,600 C/1
  s/4 s. Zn determinations were performed using flame atomic absorption spectrometry.\n\nQuality
  control measures included the use of laboratory reagent blanks, sample duplicates
  and the certified reference material BCR No. 278R, which was analysed for the evaluation
  of measurement accuracies, which were 348  7/347  14/99.7/4.0 for Cd, 9.45  0.13/9.43
  \ 0.28/99.8/3.0 for Cu  and 83.1  1.7/83.9  2.6/101/3.1 for Zn. For every batch
  of ten samples, a reagent blank and a certified reference material sample were run.
  In case metal concentrations in the reagent blank were detectable, the procedure
  for the whole batch was repeated. The calculation of the method limits of detection
  \ was made by multiplying the standard deviation of seven replicate spikes, prepared
  at an appropriate low concentration, by 3.14. The MLD values obtained were 2.6 ng/g
  for Cd, 0.1 g/g for Cu and 1 g/g for Zn.\n\nTotal dissolved metals were determined
  using the solvent extraction technique described by Danielsson et al., whereas the
  diffusive gradients in thin films  labile metals were measured in situ using the
  DGT assemblies proposed by Davison and Zhang. Cd and Cu concentrations were determined
  using GFAAS and Zn using FAAS.\n\nTotal metal concentrations in SPM were determined
  following filtration of 4 L of seawater through previously weighed 0.45-m filters
  of nitric cellulose  and further digestion of the filters with the addition of HNO3
  65 % supra pure, 6 N HCl  and HF 3840 % ; heating for 6 h at 100 C; and dilution
  to a final volume of 25 mL. The metal concentrations in the solutions obtained were
  determined using AAS as described above.\n\nIn order to characterize the solid-state
  fractionation of trace metals in SPM among a number of operationally defined host
  fractions, the dry filters containing particulate material  were leached or digested
  using a three-step procedure proposed by Lewis and Landing, slightly modified by
  Wen et al.. Leaching agents included:  4.5 N CH3COOH ;  2 N HCl and 1 N HNO3 ; and
  \ HNO3 65 %, 6 N HCl and HF 3840 %. The metal concentrations in particulate matter
  leachates were determined using AAS as described above.\n\nDetermination of the
  total metal content and of the weakly bound fraction of the sediments extracted
  with HCl 0.5 N is described analytically by Sakellari et al.. Cd concentrations
  were measured using GFAAS, and Cu and Zn using FAAS.\n\nThe metal/shell weight index
  \ was calculated according to Fischer. According to Soto et al., the metal/shell
  weight index provides a reliable tool for the assessment of metal bioavailability
  to sentinel mollusks in coastal waters. It is useful in eliminating part of the
  variability due to the inherent biology of sentinel mussels.\n\nThe statistical
  techniques used were one-way/two-way factorial ANOVA and Pearsons correlation test.
  Statistical analyses were performed using the software package PASW Statistics  18.0.
  A value of p ; 0.05  was considered to indicate a significant difference  or a significant
  correlation  in the statistical analysis of the data.\n\nThe concentrations of metals
  in the dissolved phase, the suspended particulate matter and the sediments are presented
  in Table 1. The labile forms of metals in the various phases are of particular importance,
  as being more bioavailable. Dissolved Zn was determined to be DGT labile to a great
  extent since its mean DGT labile fraction was found to represent 8394 % of its mean
  total dissolved concentration, whereas in the cases of Cd and Cu, the corresponding
  percentages were determined to vary from 34 to 52 % and from 24 to 38 %, respectively.
  Many researchers have shown that in marine systems, dissolved Cu is almost fully
  complexed by organic ligands, followed by Cd and Zn which demonstrate more labile
  behaviour considering their complexation with organic ligands. It is now widely
  recognized that organic complexation decreases the toxicity of the metal  by reducing
  the levels of free ions. The high percentage of Cu complexation with organic matter
  in seawater is attributed to its biogenic character since it is a required constituent
  in many enzyme systems, the most notable of which are the enzyme of cytochrome oxidase
  and the electron carrier plastocyanin.\n\nMean metal concentrations and standard
  deviations in the dissolved phase, SPM and sediments   \n\nMean metal concentrations:
  four samplings for the dissolved phase and SPM; two samplings for sediments\n\nIn
  the Elefsis Gulf, the highest DGT labile and total dissolved Cu and Zn concentrations
  were detected and, at Molos, the highest concentration of DGT labile Cd, showing
  a statistically significant difference from the rest of the areas studied. The highest
  concentrations of all the metals studied in the total SPM were detected at Molos
  site, attributed to the particularly fine-grained sediment of the specific site
  and its resuspension to overlying seawater. Regarding metal fractionation in SPM,
  the distributions of Cd, Cu and Zn in the three fractions examined demonstrate relatively
  small differences, excluding the Molos site. Cd is found mainly in the first fraction
  of the leaching procedure, which is the most labile, obtained with 4.5 N CH3COOH,
  with its concentration varying from 54 to 73 % of the total SPM metal. The corresponding
  values of the first fraction for Cu and Zn range between 30 and 68 % and between
  42 and 91 %, respectively. On the contrary, at the Molos area, the more inert forms
  of both Cu and Zn  seem to prevail.\n\nThe highest mean concentration of total metals
  in sediment was recorded at the Loutropyrgos site, with the single exception of
  Cu, the highest concentration of which was determined at the Molos area. The variation
  of the mean total metal concentrations in sediment greatly follows the same pattern
  as the weakly bound fraction of metals, obtained by extraction with 0.5 N HCl. Considering
  metal lability in sediment, the highest values of the weakly bound fraction of Zn
  are determined in the silt and clay fractions of sediments from the Loutropyrgos
  site, whereas for the rest of the locations investigated, the corresponding values
  range from 24 to 57 %. The study of metals in different environmental phases points
  out that in all cases examined, Zn appears to be more labile compared to Cd and
  Cu.\n\nExamination of the relationship among the metal concentrations in the dissolved
  phase, the suspended particulate matter and the sediments indicates a positive correlation
  of DGT labile Cu with the total dissolved Cu. Regarding Zn, a positive correlation
  was found between DGT labile Zn and both total dissolved Zn  and weakly bound Zn
  in the sediment. For both total dissolved Cu and Zn, there is a correlation with
  the weakly bound Cu and Zn in sediments. No significant correlation was shown for
  Cd in the various phases. Of particular interest is the correlation of Zn between
  the dissolved phase and its labile fraction in the sediment, which seems to be independent
  of SPM.\n\nThe range of metal concentrations measured in the whole soft tissues
  of the bivalves examined demonstrated that all the samples analysed were enriched
  with heavy metals at different levels. The metal concentrations  in M. galloprovincialis
  were determined as equal to 0.262/5.43/1.03 for Cd, 0.9/11/3.7 for Cu and 33/804/173
  for Zn; in P. radiata as equal to 1.41/17.7/6.46 for Cd, 2.8/18/6.3 for Cu and 1930/13716/4687
  for Zn; in V. verrucosa as equal to 0.330/11.2/2.26 for Cd, 3.4/29/11 for Cu and
  49/180/84 for Zn; and in C. chione as equal to 0.120/3.78/0.486 for Cd, 3.0/22/8.3
  for Cu and 38/67/50 for Zn.\n\nAccording to the US National Status and Trends Mussel
  Watch Program  following two decades of pollution monitoring in the US coastal zone,
  in order to assess the different degrees of pollution, three levels of concentration
  ranges of contaminants were assigned in milligrams per kilogram dry weight of mussel:
  low/medium/high. Based on the aforementioned levels of concentration ranges, the
  Elefsis Gulf appears particularly enriched in zinc since 11 mussel samples from
  the area of Loutropyrgos and 13 from the Blue lagoon were found in the class of
  high concentrations regarding Zn, whereas regarding Cd and Cu, all of the samples
  at all sampling stations are found in the class of low metal concentrations.\n\nThe
  significantly higher Cd, Cu and Zn levels detected in oysters in comparison to mussels,
  also recorded by other researchers, reflect their widely differentiated ability
  to accumulate metals.\n\nMetal/shell weight indices were used to characterize each
  site and season depending on metal bioavailability. It is evident that the bioaccumulated
  Zn in M. galloprovincialis specimens from the Gulf of Elefsis  and Cd in P. radiata
  and V. verrucosa species from the Maliakos Gulf, during both winter and summer,
  demonstrated the highest values among the total samples analysed.\n\nMean metal/shell
  weight indices  of bivalves \n\nAccording to Soto et al., the metal/shell weight
  index does not exhibit seasonal fluctuations in non-polluted sites, as could be
  expected by the absence of local inputs. On the contrary, at a polluted site, the
  metal/shell weight index changed seasonally in relation to the intensity of the
  industrial activity, indicating fluctuations in the metal bioavailability. Consequently,
  the metal/shell weight indices provide a method to detect differences and changes
  in the overall availability of cumulative metals, as Fischer  concluded from laboratory
  studies and Regoli and Orlando  as applied to the particular case of Pb-exposed
  mussels. Data of the present study showed higher mean Cd, Cu and Zn/shell weight
  indices in mussels in winter in comparison to summer. In oysters, higher mean Cd/shell
  weight indices were found in summer in all the examined areas, whereas no significant
  seasonal variation was observed regarding Cu and Zn. Concerning V. verrucosa and
  C. chione species, no specific seasonal trends were recorded. In oysters, the tendency
  characterizing Cd is different from that shown by the rest of the bivalves examined
  in the present study. This might be related to biological factors such as the increment
  of the feed rate of oysters due to the elevation of seawater temperature. Another
  factor which may possibly contribute to the increased values of metal/shell weight
  indices obtained during winter is the intense stratification observed, particularly
  in the Elefsis Gulf, during summer, followed by an abrupt vertical mixing of seawater
  layers towards the end of summer/autumn and the subsequent homogenization of the
  water column during winter. The area under the thermocline, where particles are
  scavenged during the summer period and hypoxic or anoxic conditions prevail, constitutes
  a secondary metal source through the remobilization of metals due to a series of
  complex mechanisms.\n\nThe metal/shell weight indices of the bivalves examined were
  found to correlate with the metal concentrations in the dissolved phase, the suspended
  particulate matter and the sediment. Regarding the mussel M. galloprovincialis,
  its Zn/shell weight indices are associated with Zn concentrations in the dissolved
  phase and in the weakly bound fraction of sediment. Since mussels live at some,
  even small, distance from the sea bottom, the impact of sediment to dissolved Zn
  levels seems indirect, through an intense resupply of zinc in pore water from sediment
  at the Loutropyrgos area, correlating with the highest value of the weakly bound
  fraction of Zn at this area, as shown by Sakellari et al.. The comparatively high
  Zn concentrations measured in the pore waters  exceed considerably those in the
  overlying seawater, resulting in the formation of a strong concentration gradient
  in the sedimentwater interface, and the potential Zn flux at the sedimentwater interface
  at Loutropyrgos was calculated as 0.8 mmol m2 day1. The correlation found between
  Zn/shell weight indices of M. galloprovincialis and the Zn concentrations in the
  dissolved phase is in accordance with Chong and Wang  who have observed that mussels
  uptake from the dissolved phase constitutes the determining factor in total Zn accumulation,
  whereas Fisher et al.  and Wang and Fisher  demonstrated that the uptake from the
  dissolved phase is important for metals such as Zn, which tend to be transported
  through a relatively simple procedure.\n\nPearson correlation coefficients  between
  metal levels in the dissolved phase ; in suspended particulate matter  in sediments
  ; and metal/shell weight indices in the bivalves studied  \n\nIn the oyster P. radiat,
  Zn was shown to correlate with the total quantity of Zn in the sediment. Cu correlated
  with its weakly bound fraction in sediment and Cd with DGT labile Cd and its quantity
  in total SPM. The correlation found among all metals in the oyster P. radiata with
  their concentrations in suspended particulate matter, which notably are not particularly
  low, is in accordance with Ke and Wang  who suggest that dissolved uptake contributes
  significantly to metal accumulation only when the metal concentration factor  in
  the particles is in the lower end of the range typically found in nature; otherwise,
  sediments become a significant source of metals. Sensitivity analysis indicates
  that the metal CF is a critical parameter in determining the exposure pathways of
  metals in oysters.\n\nThe intense correlation of Zn and Cu/shell weight indices
  in V. verrucosa species with their corresponding concentrations in the weakly bound
  fraction of sediment  confirms the impact of sediment to the specific organism living
  within the sediment, under the sea bottom surface, since in its filter-feeding mode
  it is exposed to the dissolved metals of its burrow water, which is a mixture of
  hypoxic/anoxic pore water and overlying  water. No significant correlations were
  observed for any of the studied metals in the case of C. chione.\n\nIn Fig. 4, the
  concentrations of Cd, Cu and Zn distributed among the different organs of the organisms
  studied are presented. In M. galloprovincialis, the highest Zn concentrations were
  detected in gills, whereas Cd and Cu accumulated at similar levels in both the gills
  and the digestive gland of mussels and at higher levels compared to muscle and mantle.
  According to Dimitriadis et al., gills and the digestive gland constitute mussels
  most important target organs. In the case of P. radiate, Cu and Zn are mainly accumulated
  in the digestive gland  whilst Cd in the muscle tissue. The gills of V. verrucosa
  specimens demonstrated significantly higher Cd concentrations in comparison to the
  rest of the soft tissues examined, whereas significantly higher values of Cu and
  Zn were found in its digestive gland and mantle compared to gills and muscle, respectively.
  Romeo and Gnassia-Barelli  support that the high Cd content of V. verrucosa compared
  to other species appears to be of natural origin. Regarding metal distribution among
  the soft tissues of C. chione specimens examined, the highest concentrations of
  Cd and Cu were detected in the gills and the digestive gland respectively, whilst
  Zn was almost evenly distributed among the gills, digestive gland and muscle. This
  pattern of Zn in C. chione species, which differs from the rest of the bivalves
  examined, constitutes an indication of an effective regulation of Zn concentrations
  within this organism.\n\nMean metal concentrations  among the different tissues
  of bivalves\n\nThe highest concentrations of Zn and Cu in the dissolved phase and
  sediments were determined in the Gulf of Elefsis, whereas those of all metals in
  SPM were at the area of Molos. Among the examined metals, Zn was more DGT labile
  in the dissolved phase, followed by Cd  and Cu. A significant percentage  of the
  weakly bound Zn in sediment was detected at the Loutropyrgos site, where an important
  flux of Zn in the sedimentwater interface occurs.\n\nIn mussels, a correlation of
  Zn/shell weight indices to the concentrations of dissolved Zn and the weakly bound
  Zn in sediments was shown. The highest values of bioaccumulated Zn determined at
  Loutropyrgos in comparison to the rest of the study areas, in combination with the
  highest Zn concentrations detected in mussel gills, enhance the view that at the
  specific area, Zn uptake by mussels is significantly affected by the continuous
  supply in Zn of overlying water by sediment.\n\nIn P. radiata and V. verrucosa,
  the high values of Cd/shell weight indices are correlated with the high concentrations
  of DGT labile Cd in the dissolved phase and Cd in the total SPM. These findings,
  combined with Cd accumulation mainly in the muscle tissue of P. radiata and in the
  gills of V. verrucosa, demonstrate the difference in Cd bioaccumulation mechanisms
  between these species.\n\nThe lack of positive correlation for C. chione confirms
  the occurrence of effective mechanisms of internal regulation of metal concentrations;
  consequently, this bivalve is not appropriate to be used as a bioindicator of the
  examined metals.\n\n"
