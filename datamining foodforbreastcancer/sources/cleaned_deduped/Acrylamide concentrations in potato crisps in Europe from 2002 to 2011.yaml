text: "\n\nA dataset of manufacturers measurements of acrylamide levels in 40,455
  samples of fresh sliced potato crisps from 20 European countries for years 2002
  to 2011 was compiled. This dataset is by far the largest ever compiled relating
  to acrylamide levels in potato crisps. Analysis of variance was applied to the data
  and showed a clear, significant downward trend for mean levels of acrylamide, from
  763  91.1 ng g1  in 2002 to 358  2.5 ng g1 in 2011; this was a decrease of 53%  13.5%.
  The yearly 95th quantile values were also subject to a clear downward trend. The
  effect of seasonality arising from the influence of potato storage on acrylamide
  levels was evident, with acrylamide in the first 6 months of the year being significantly
  higher than in the second 6 months. The proportion of samples containing acrylamide
  at a level above the indicative value of 1000 ng g1 for potato crisps introduced
  by the European Commission in 2011 fell from 23.8% in 2002 to 3.2% in 2011. Nevertheless,
  even in 2011, a small proportion of samples still contained high levels of acrylamide,
  with 0.2% exceeding 2000 ng g1.\n\nA dataset of manufacturers measurements of acrylamide

  high levels of acrylamide, with 0.2% exceeding 2000 ng g1.\n\nThe formation of acrylamide
  during the high-temperature cooking and processing of foods made from potatoes,
  cereals and other crops has become one of the most intractable problems facing the
  food industry since the discovery of acrylamide in food in 2002 (Tareke et al. 200229\\.

  a carcinogen formed in heated foodstuffs. J Agric Food Chem. 50: 49985006.  \nView
  all references). Acrylamide is classified by the World Health Organization and the
  International Agency for Research on Cancer as a Group 2a carcinogen, and it also
  has effects on neurological and reproductive systems at high doses (Friedman 200310\\.
  Friedman M. 2003. Chemistry, biochemistry and safety of acrylamide. A review. J
  Agric Food Chem. 51:45044526.  \n\nThe FAO/WHO Joint Expert Committee of Food Additives
  \ recently concluded that the margins of exposure for acrylamide indicate that dietary
  intake is a human health concern and that epidemiological studies using haemoglobin
  adducts of acrylamide itself or its primary epoxide metabolite, glycidamide, as
  a measure of exposure were required to estimate the risk. However, the JECFA conceded
  that to date the results of epidemiological studies have been inconsistent and that
  overall the epidemiological studies do not provide any consistent evidence that
  occupational exposure or dietary exposure to acrylamide is associated with cancer
  in humans, though it noted that some studies indicated an association with hormone-related
  cancers in women, which needed confirmation (Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee of Food
  Additives 201114\\. Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives. 2011. Safety
  evaluation of certain contaminants in food. WHO Food Additives Series: 63; FAO JECFA

  of the United Nations, Rome, 2011. Available from: http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2011/9789241660631eng.pdf
  \ \nView all references). Another review of the epidemiological data published in
  recent years concluded that the sporadically and slightly increased and decreased
  risk ratios seen in the studies suggested the pattern one would expect to find for
  a true null hypothesis (Lipworth et al. 201216\\. Lipworth L, Sonderman JS, Tarone
  RE, McLaughlin JK. 2012. Review of epidemiologic studies of dietary acrylamide intake
  and the risk of cancer. Eur J Cancer Prev. 21:375386.  \nView all references). However,
  more recently, a Danish study found a link between acrylamide exposure and breast
  cancerspecific mortality (Olsen et al. 201221\\. Olsen A, Christensen J, Outzen
  M, Olesen PT, Frandsen H, Overvad K, Halkjr J. 2012. Pre-diagnostic acrylamide exposure
  and survival after breast cancer among postmenopausal Danish women. Toxicology.

  adducts of acrylamide and glycidamide in umbilical cord blood  and low birth weight
  and head circumference in babies. Environ Health Perspect. 120:17391745.  \n\nGiven
  the low margins of exposure and the uncertainty regarding the human health risk
  from acrylamide in the diet, the JECFA and other risk assessment bodies have recommended
  that acrylamide levels in food be reduced as a matter of priority and the European
  Commission issued indicative levels for acrylamide in food in early 2011. Indicative
  values are not safety thresholds but are intended to indicate the need for an investigation
  into why the level has been exceeded. Fried potatoes  and potato crisps are important
  contributors to dietary intake across Europe (European Food Safety Authority 20118\\.

  monitoring years 20072009 and exposure assessment. EFSA J. 9:2133.  \nView all references),
  along with bread, coffee, biscuits and, in some countries, rye crisp-breads, and
  the manufacturers of these foods have devised many strategies for reducing acrylamide
  formation by modifying food processing. These strategies have been compiled in a
  Toolbox produced by FoodDrinkEurope ; they include modification of time/temperature
  conditions during processing, lowering the pH by addition of citric acid, pre-soaking
  in water, addition of antioxidants and addition of divalent cations, such as calcium
  chloride. The addition of asparaginase to reduce asparagine concentration prior
  to cooking has been successful in some products but is not applicable to all foods.
  Further progress may be possible by variety selection (Amrein et al. 20031\\. Amrein

  \ \n\nThe publication of European data on acrylamide levels in a variety of foods
  from 2007 to 2010 (European Food Safety Authority 20129\\. European Food Safety
  Authority. 2012. Update on acrylamide levels in food from monitoring years 20072010.
  EFSA J. 10:2938.  \nView all references) has been used as a measure of whether the
  strategies identified within the Toolbox approach have been successfully implemented
  by the European food industry. This study reported the analysis of 13,162 samples
  in 25 countries over the 4-year period, covering 10 different food categories. For
  potato crisps, only 293, 532, 414 and 242 samples were analysed in years 2007, 2008,
  2009 and 2010, respectively, making a total of 1481. However, the study reported
  no significant trend in acrylamide levels in these crisps. Evidence or lack of evidence
  of the efficacy of the Toolbox approach taken by the food industry is important
  because it will inform future European member state discussions on their approach
  to the acrylamide issue.\n\nIn the present study, we report the analysis of a much
  larger dataset for acrylamide concentrations in potato crisps from 2002 to 2011
  and show that, in contrast to previous findings, a general trend of decreasing acrylamide
  levels over time was sustained throughout that period.\n\nData on acrylamide levels
  in samples of potato crisps were supplied by the European Snacks Association. All
  analyses had been performed using procedures based on LC-MS/MS (Roach et al. 200325\\.
  Roach JAG, Andrzejewski D, Gay ML, Nortrup D, Musser SM. 2003. Rugged LC-MS/MS survey
  analysis for acrylamide in foods. J Agric Food Chem. 51:75477554.  \nView all references),
  and all of the laboratories that conducted the analyses had carried out validations
  on the methods used. The methods were compatible with the Comit Europen de Normalisation
  \ standard method, which is due to be published under Mandate M463 at the end of
  2013.\n\nThe GenStat  statistical package was used for the calculation of summary
  statistics, and analysis of variance  was used to test the overall significance
  \ of differences between years using all the data. The SigmaPlot  package was used
  for graphs except histograms for which GenStat was used. Excel  was used to store
  the data.\n\nData on acrylamide levels in samples of potato crisps were supplied
  to the European Snacks Association by European manufacturers, having been collected
  over 10 years from 2002 to 2011. The data concerned crisps made from fresh, sliced
  potatoes, rather than from potato dough. Only those data for which acrylamide analyses
  had been carried out following authenticated analytical procedures using LC-MS/MS
  were included in the study. The dataset comprised 40,455 observations from crisps
  produced in 20 countries, making it by far the largest dataset to be analysed to
  date, and the numbers of observations for each year are shown in Table 1. Note that
  the number of observations per year prior to 2006 was relatively low, with 2002
  having data only from May to November. \n\n\n\nTable 1.  Number of observations,
  mean, standard error of mean, variance, minimum, median, 95% quantile  and maximum
  values for acrylamide in samples of potato crisps from 2002 to 2011.\n\nThe mean,
  standard error of the mean, variance, median, 95% quantile  and minimum and maximum
  values for acrylamide for each year are given in Table 1. The data were subjected
  to ANOVA. On the  log  scale, the data were found to be distributed as Normal. Analysis
  of residuals  showed reasonable conformation to the assumptions of ANOVA. A statistical
  assessment was made of the year-to-year differences, based on the estimated standard
  error of the difference  between pairs of means, which was calculated from the residual
  variance in the data. Because the year-to-year replication was unequal, there was
  one SED for each comparison. Corresponding least significant difference  values
  were then calculated by multiplying the SED by the upper 97.5% critical value of
  a t-distribution on the residual degrees of freedom from the ANOVA. Pairs of means
  on the log  scale  that differ by more than the corresponding LSD  are significantly
  different at the 5%  level. \n\n\n\nFigure 1.  Distribution  of the loge values

  3.  Least significant difference  values on 40,445 degrees of freedom at the 5%
  \ level of significance, from analysis of variance of acrylamide in samples of potato
  crisps from 2002 to 2011.\n\nThe analysis revealed a highly significant effect of
  years, with a general trend of decreasing acrylamide levels from 763  91.1 ng g1
  in 2002 to 358  2.5 ng g1 in 2011, an overall significant  reduction of 53%  13.5%.
  The trend in the Q95 values was also downward, from 2080 ng g1 in 2002 to 870 ng
  g1 in 2011. 2011 was the first year in which the Q95 was below the 1000 ng g1 indicative
  level for potato crisps set by the European Commission. Nevertheless, the range
  of acrylamide levels in the samples was wide, as can be seen from the standard errors,
  minima, maxima and variances.\n\nThe overall trends are shown graphically in the
  plot of mean and Q95 acrylamide values over time in Figure 2. The first statistically
  significant  year-to-year reduction in acrylamide was for 20052006, but this may
  in part be due to the low sample number in years 20022005, and the lack of samples
  from early 2002. There were also significant  year-to-year reductions for 20072008,
  20092010 and 20102011. \n\n\n\nFigure 2.  Overall mean acrylamide levels  in samples
  of potato crisps shown over years from 2002 to 2011, with standard errors and with
  trend in 95%  quantiles.\n\nFigure 2.  Overall mean acrylamide levels  in samples
  of potato crisps shown over years from 2002 to 2011, with standard errors and with
  trend in 95%  quantiles.\n\nThe mean, median  and Q95 acrylamide levels for potato
  crisps produced each month showed clear seasonality. This was evident when the mean
  was plotted monthly over time  and when the overall mean and Q95 values for each
  month were plotted. Note that the lower standard errors on the monthly means from
  2006 onwards  arise from the greater numbers of observations that were taken in
  more recent years and the resulting greater precision. The data show the acrylamide
  level in potato crisps to be at its lowest in July when new season potatoes start
  to be used in production in most European countries. The level remains low in August
  and September before increasing from October until January, then remaining relatively
  high until the cycle starts again in July. \n\n\n\nFigure 3.  Seasonality in acrylamide

  \ values for acrylamide in samples of potato crisps for each month using data from
  2002 to 2011.\n\nThe number and percentage of observations that were greater than
  1000 or 2000 ng g1 in each year are given in Table 5, and the percentages are displayed
  in Figure 4 to show the trend. In 2002, 23.8% of the observations exceeded 1000
  ng g1, the indicative level set for potato crisps by the European Commission in
  2011, but the proportion had fallen to 5.2% by 2010 and 3.2% by 2011. Indeed, these
  last 2 years were clearly the best so far for meeting the criteria of reducing acrylamide
  in potato crisps to less than 1000 ng g1, although variability remained. The proportion
  of observations exceeding 2000 ng g1 also showed a fall, from 4.8% in 2002 to 0.2%
  in 2011. This included a small number of samples with very high levels of acrylamide,
  which resulted in the data being positively skewed on the raw scale, with the mean
  higher than the median. \n\n\n\nFigure 4.  Percentage of samples of potato crisps

  crisp samples containing more than 1000 or 2000 ng g1 acrylamide for each year from
  2002 to 2011.\n\nThis study shows a clear downward trend in acrylamide levels in
  potato crisps in Europe that predated both the introduction of European-wide monitoring
  and indicative values, and was sustained right up to 2011, with significant year-on-year
  reductions from 2005 to 2006, 2007 to 2008, 2009 to 2010 and 2010 to 2011. The decrease
  from 763 ng g1 in 2002 to 358 ng g1 in 2011 represented an overall significant  reduction
  of 53%. It is important to note that the study was European-wide and the situation
  may be different in some individual countries because acrylamide-forming potential
  in potato may be influenced by environmental factors. However, overall the study
  demonstrates the effectiveness of the approaches taken by potato crisp manufacturers
  to reduce acrylamide levels in their products, as compiled in the FoodDrinkEurope
  Acrylamide Toolbox.\n\nA continuation of the downward trend in acrylamide levels
  in potato crisps from 2007 onwards was not evident in data compiled by the EFSA
  for potato crisps. The EFSA reported a mean acrylamide level of 551 ng g1 in potato
  crisps in 2007, slightly lower than the 570 ng g1 reported here, but showed no significant
  trend from 2007 to 2010, the latest year for which data were included in their report.
  In fact, acrylamide levels in 2010 were reported as having risen slightly  to 675
  ng g1, whereas this study showed a continued reduction to 435 ng g1 in 2010 and
  358 ng g1 in 2011. The decrease from 570 ng g1 in 2007 to 358 ng g1 in 2011 represents
  a reduction of 37%. There is no obvious reason why the results of the two studies
  should differ except that the dataset compiled for the present study was very much
  larger than the EFSA dataset and therefore more likely to be representative of the
  real situation. For 2010, for example, the EFSA dataset included only 242 potato
  crisp samples, whereas the analysis reported here was based on 10,971 samples. It
  was notable from the EFSA report that the number of samples being analysed has declined
  in recent years, from a total for all food types of 3889 in 2008 to 2071 in 2010,
  and for potato crisps of 532 in 2008 to 242 in 2010, a decrease of 54%. The EFSA
  relies on national organisations to sample foods and submit data for inclusion in
  its analysis, and its report states that the decline may reflect the challenges
  that countries have had in submitting requested acrylamide data in a standardised
  way (European Food Safety Authority 20129\\. European Food Safety Authority. 2012.
  Update on acrylamide levels in food from monitoring years 20072010. EFSA J. 10:2938.
  \ \n\nThe range of acrylamide levels in the samples was wide, as can be seen from
  the minima, maxima and variances. The fact that the Q95 value was shown to be falling
  over time is therefore another important indicator of progress. However, even in
  2011, which was the first year in which the Q95 was below the European Commissions
  indicative value of 1000 ng g1 for potato crisps, 3.2% of the samples contained
  levels of acrylamide that exceeded the indicative value. The wide range of acrylamide
  levels probably reflects variability in the raw material and the difficulty of processing
  such a variable raw material to give a consistently low acrylamide level in the
  product. Potato tuber composition differs significantly between varieties (Amrein
  et al. 2003, 20042\\. Amrein TM, Schnbchler B, Rohner F, Lukac H, Schneider H, Keiser

  precursors for acrylamide, accumulate rapidly in stored potato tubers in response
  to the temperature falling below approximately 8C : CAB International.  \nView all
  references), to sprouting  and to extended storage beyond the normal storage window,
  which is different for each variety (Halford, Muttucumaru et al. 201213\\. Halford

  \ \nView all references). Potatoes are, therefore, usually stored at 810C to prevent
  cold sweetening, while sprouting, which would occur at this temperature, is controlled
  through the use of sprout suppressants such as chlorpropham. The problem of keeping
  potatoes stable during storage was reflected in the seasonality of acrylamide levels
  shown in the study, with levels being lowest in July to September when potatoes
  are being harvested and highest in the early months of the calendar year when potatoes
  have to be used from long-term storage.\n\nImproving the storage characteristics
  of potatoes, reducing the concentrations of free asparagine, the other precursor
  for acrylamide, and reducing sugars and making the concentrations of these metabolites
  less responsive to environmental factors is being addressed by potato breeders.
  Potato breeding is a slow process, however, and so food processors will have to
  be patient as they wait for improved varieties that will enable them to reduce acrylamide
  levels further without additional changes to processes. Nevertheless, it is important
  that potato breeders be encouraged to make reduced acrylamide-forming potential
  a priority and that they have sufficient information on how to achieve that target.\n\nAlthough
  some genetic investigation has been done (Shepherd et al. 201026\\. Shepherd LVT,
  Bradshaw JE, Dale MFB, McNicol JW, Pont SDA, Mottram DS, Davies HV. 2010. Variation
  in acrylamide producing potential in potato: segregation of the trait in a breeding
  population. Food Chem. 123:568573.  \nView all references), identifying targets
  for breeders that will result in reduced acrylamide-forming potential in potato
  is not simple. The predominant route for acrylamide formation is through the Maillard
  reaction (Mottram et al. 200219\\. Mottram DS, Wedzicha BL, Dodson AT. 2002. Acrylamide

  give particular products and brands their defining characteristics. Reducing acrylamide
  formation while not affecting the qualities that are demanded by consumers is therefore
  very difficult, and it is important that breeders take this into account as they
  bring about changes in potato composition.\n\nThe other problem for breeders is
  that the relationship between the concentrations of reducing sugars and free asparagine
  in potatoes and acrylamide formation during cooking and processing is complicated.
  Different studies, for example, have concluded that reducing sugar concentration,
  free asparagine concentration or free asparagine concentration as a proportion of
  the total free amino acid pool could be the determining factors (Amrein et al. 20031\\.

  were shown between reducing sugar concentration and acrylamide-forming potential
  in nine varieties of potatoes grown commercially in the United Kingdom, but free
  asparagine and total free amino acid concentration also correlated significantly
  with acrylamide-forming potential in French fry varieties, which contain higher
  concentrations of sugars than do crisping varieties. Another recent study modelled
  the kinetics of acrylamide formation in French fry production and concluded that
  reducing the ratio of free asparagine to total free amino acids could be the best
  strategy because it would decrease acrylamide formation without affecting quality
  (Parker et al. 201223\\. Parker JK, Balagiannis DP, Higley J, Smith G, Wedzicha
  BL, Mottram DS. 2012. Kinetic model for the formation of acrylamide during the finish-frying
  of commercial French fries. J Agric Food Chem. 60:93219331.  \n\nVariability in
  the raw material from tuber to tuber may explain why some of the acrylamide levels
  in the study were over the 1000 ng g1 indicative level, but it is difficult to understand
  how levels in a small number of samples were much higher than this. As discussed
  above, colour in crisps forms via similar pathways to acrylamide and a crisp containing
  such high levels of acrylamide would be a very dark colour. Such dark crisps are
  normally removed during standard industry quality control procedures and would not
  reach the market. Assuming that they have been measured accurately, these high acrylamide
  concentrations, therefore, could indicate a breakdown in either variety selection
  or processing, together with a failure in post-production quality control. They
  show that there is still room for improvement, and the cause of such high acrylamide
  levels would certainly require further investigation by the manufacturer. However,
  these samples represented a tiny fraction of the total. Indeed, by 2011, the proportion
  of samples exceeding 2000 ng g1 was only 0.2%.\n\nIn conclusion, this study represents
  the statistical analysis of the largest dataset ever compiled of acrylamide levels
  in potato crisps. It shows a clear, significant downward trend for mean levels of
  acrylamide from 2002, when acrylamide was first discovered in food, to 2011, suggesting
  that the Toolbox approach co-ordinated by FoodDrinkEurope has been effective.\n\nRothamsted
