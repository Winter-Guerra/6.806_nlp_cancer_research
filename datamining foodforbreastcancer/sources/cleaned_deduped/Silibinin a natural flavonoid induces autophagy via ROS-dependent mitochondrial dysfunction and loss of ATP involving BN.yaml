  Silibinin, derived from the milk thistle plant, has anticancer and chemopreventive
  properties. Silibinin has been reported to inhibit the growth of various types of
  cancer cells. However, the mechanisms by which silibinin exerts an anticancer effect
  are poorly defined. The present study aimed to investigate whether silibinin-induced
  cell death might be attributed to autophagy and the underlying mechanisms in human
  MCF7 breast cancer cells. Our results showed that silibinin-induced cell death was
  greatly abrogated by two specific autophagy inhibitors, 3-methyladenine  and bafilomycin-A1.
  In addition, silibinin triggered the conversion of light chain 3 -I to LC3-II, promoted
  the upregulation of Atg12-Atg5 formation, increased Beclin-1 expression, and decreased
  the Bcl-2 level. Moreover, we noted elevated reactive oxygen species  generation,
  concomitant with the dissipation of mitochondrial transmembrane potential  and a
  drastic decline in ATP levels following silibinin treatment, which were effectively
  prevented by the antioxidants, N-acetylcysteine and ascorbic acid. Silibinin stimulated
  the expression of Bcl-2 adenovirus E1B 19-kDa-interacting protein 3, a pro-death
  Bcl-2 family member, and silencing of BNIP3 greatly inhibited silibinin-induced
  cell death, decreased ROS production, and sustained m and ATP levels. Taken together,
  these findings revealed that silibinin induced autophagic cell death through ROS-dependent
  mitochondrial dysfunction and ATP depletion involving BNIP3 in MCF7 cells.'
