  Novel Triterpenoid Isolated from Apple Functions as an Anti-mammary Tumor Agent
  via a Mitochondrial and Caspase-Indepe.md
text: '


  A novel triterpenoid, named 3-trans-cinnamoyloxy-2-hydroxy-urs-12-en-28-oic acid,
  was one of the main components of apple peels and showed potent in vitro antitumor
  activity against human tumor cells. In vivo antitumor experiments showed that CHUA
  could significantly inhibit the growth of mammary tumor in a nude mouse xenograft
  model at a dose of 50 mg/kg/day without body weight loss and mortality. In vitro,
  CHUA could induce apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells through the detection of DNA fragments
  and LDH activity. Simultaneously, mitochondrial transmembrane potential was markedly
  reduced and the release of cytochrome c was increased after CHUA treatment. It also
  up-regulated the expression ratio of mitochondrial Bax/Bcl-2 regulated by SIRT1
  and p53. Interestingly, z-VAD-fmk and z-DEVD-fmk augmented cell death after CHUA
  treatment. Other protease different from caspase-3 might be responsible for the
  degradation of PARP. These results suggested that the pro-apoptotic activity of
  CHUA may be adjusted by mitochondrial and caspase-independent pathways.

  acid


  Apple  is one of the most widely cultivated tree fruits. Epidemiological studies
  have shown that the consumption of apples may be related to a significantly reduced
  risk of many diseases such as carcinogenesis, cardiovascular disease, cognitive
  impairment, acute inflammatory disease, and diabetes. Moreover, apple extracts have
  been shown to protect against gastrointestinal mucosa alterations and have antitumor
  activity. Therefore, apples as an important part of consumption of plant foods could
  be beneficial for human health.


  The bioactive compounds and antitumor activities of apple were investigated in our
  previous study. Twenty-two triterpenoids, including eight novels, have been purified
  from the peels of Red Delicious apple. It was found that the triterpenoids of apples
  exhibited pronounced in vitro antitumor activities and may be responsible for the
  antitumor activities of whole apples. The total triterpenoids  of apples showed
  antitumor activity and could initiate apoptosis of breast cancer cells through mitochondrial
  pathway.


  Apoptosis is a fundamental cellular response, which plays a crucial role in regulating
  tissue homeostasis by removing unused cells. It is a well conserved cell death pathway
  executed by caspases including initiator and executioner. Caspases, a family of
  cysteine proteases, have the main function as central regulators of cell death during
  apoptosis.


  Cell apoptosis is mainly induced by intrinsic and extrinsic pathways involving either
  mitochondria or death receptors. The mitochondria-dependent apoptosis pathway is
  mainly regulated by pro-apoptotic factor Bax and the anti-apoptotic factor Bcl-2
  family. The balance between Bax and Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL in the mitochondrial may determine
  cell survival or death. These proteins can also promote mitochondrial outer membrane
  permeabilization by regulating Mfn1, a GTPase involved in mitochondrial fusion.


  p53, a known tumor suppressor, induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis related to
  DNA damage. It can also activate its downstream target genes, including Bcl-2 and
  Bax, for apoptosis. SIRT1 is a highly conserved nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
  -dependent histone deacetylase that plays an important role in promoting cell survival
  through regulating p53 in response to DNA damage.


  A new compound named 3-trans-cinnamoyloxy-2-hydroxy-urs-12-en-28-oic acid  was isolated
  and identified from apple in our previous study. CHUA is the one of main triterpenoids
  of apple and has been shown to significantly inhibit the growth of a number of malignant
  cell lines in a former preliminary study, especially breast cancer cells. In the
  present work, CHUA was extracted and purified from red apple, and its antitumor
  activities in vivo were investigated using the nude mouse xenograft model. The proposed
  mechanisms of CHUA-induced MDA-MB-231 cell apoptosis were studied through mitochondrial
  and caspase-independent pathways in vitro.


  Red Fuji apples, which were harvested in October 2009, were bought from Wuhan Shahu
  Fruits Market.


  All analytical and HPLC grade chemicals were purchased from Mallinckrodt Chemicals.
  D101 macroporus resin was purchased from Xian Lanxiao Resin Corp. Ltd.. Cell culture
  medium, Dulbeccos modified Eagle medium, and fetal bovine serum  were products of
  Gibco Life Technologies. Bax, ICAD, PARP, cytochrome c, p53, Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, SIRT1,
  and secondary antibody were bought from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Z-Ile-Glu-Thr-Asp-FMK  and
  Z-Leu-Glu-His-Asp-FMC  were purchased from ICN. Z-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp fluoromethyl ketone  and
  benzylocarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone  were purchased from Calbiochem.
  RNase A, rhodamine 123, proteinase K, and MTT were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
  Chemical Co..


  The fresh apple peels of red Fuji variety  were dried under vacuum at 60 C and then
  smashed into powder, which was refluxed using 10 volumes of 95% ethanol for 2 h
  twice. The solvent was recovered under vacuum at 45 C, and the residue was suspended
  in 2 L of water and subjected to a D101 macroporus resin column. The column was
  eluted with 10 L of 60% ethanol and then with 10 L of 95% ethanol, respectively.
  The fraction of 95% ethanol elution was concentrated and dried, getting the total
  triterpenoids. The total triterpenoids  was subjected to a silica gel column, gradiently
  eluted with CH2Cl2/MeOH. The CH2Cl2/MeOH  elution  was purified by a Sephadex LH-20,
  followed by a HPLC  using 82% methanol  as mobile phase, and CHUA  were obtained.


  The purity of CHUA was determined according to a HPLC method using a Waters HPLC
  system. The column was LiChrospher 100 RP-100e 5 m, and detection was at 210 nm.
  The mobile phase was CH3CN/H2O/CF3COOH  with a flow rate at 1.0 mL/min. The column
  temperature was set at 40 C.


  Six-week old female nude mice  were bought from Guangdong Medical Experimental Animal
  Center. All animal experiment protocols were confirmed by the Animal Ethics Committee
  of Wuhan University. CHUA was dissolved in DMSO. Mice were randomly allocated to
  two groups with 10 animals per group. One hundred microliters of exponential MDA-MB-231
  cells  was injected subcutaneously into the backs of mice. When tumors become apparent
  after 9 days, 100 L of DMSO containing CHUA was administered intraperitonelly to
  the therapy group at a dose of 50 mg/kg/day; the vehicle group was treated by only
  100 L of DMSO in the same way. Mice were sacrificed on day 10 post-CHUA treatment,
  and the tumor tissues were collected and weighed. The length and width of the tumors
  were measured, and the tumor volume was calculated using the following equation:
  volume = /2.


  Human breast cancer, human liver cancer, human colon cancer, human cervical cancer,
  and human lung adenocarcinoma  cell lines were purchased from ATCC. The MTT method
  was utilized to evaluate the bioactivity of CHUA. Briefly, tumor cells were cultured
  in DMEM with 10% FBS and maintained at 37 C in 5% CO2. A total of 2.5  104 cells
  were seeded in each well of a 96-well plate before the experiment day. After incubation
  overnight, the cells were treated by various concentrations of CHUA for 48 h. Cell
  viability was determined by the MTT assay. Experiments were performed in triplicate
  for each sample.


  DNA extraction and electrophoresis were performed as described previously. Briefly,
  MDA-MB-231 cells  were seeded into a 100 cm dish for 24 h before the experimental
  day, and then the cells treated by 3.5 M CHUA at indicated times were incubated
  with 0.25% trypsin for 10 min at 37 C. The enzymatic digestion was terminated by
  mixing the suspension with an equal volume of DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. Then
  floating cells were collected by centrifugation at 1000g for 10 min. The cell pellet
  was washed twice in ice-cold PBS. To detect the DNA fragments, an apoptotic DNA
  Laddering Kit  was used according to the manufacturers protocol. The DNA fragments
  were separated by 2% agarose gel containing 0.2 mg/mL EB. The gel was photographed
  using an ultraviolet gel documentation system.


  The MDA-MB-231 cells  were seeded into a 6-well plate for 24 h before CHUA was added.
  On the next day, the prepared cells were treated by 3.5 M CHUA at different time
  courses or the cells were treated with or without z-VAD-fmk, z-DEVD-fmk, z-IETD-fmk,
  z-LEHD-fmk at given concentrations for 1 h and then treated with CHUA for 24 h.
  After treatment, floating cells were collected from cultured medium by centrifugation
  at 4 C for 5 min. The LDH released in the cultured supernatant was used as an index
  of necrotic death, the LDH content in the cell pellets lysis was used for the apoptotic
  death, and the LDH present in the adherent viable cells was used as intracellular
  LDH. The LDH activities of the cell lysis and the cultured supernatant were measured
  according to the reference with a slight modification.


  To measure the mitochondrial transmembrane potential, MDA-MB-231 cells  were seeded
  into a 100 cm dish for 24 h before the experimental day, and then the cells treated
  by 3.5 M CHUA at the indicated time were incubated with 0.25% trypsin for 10 min
  at 37 C. The enzymatic digestion was terminated by mixing the suspension with an
  equal volume of DMEM. The cells were collected by centrifugation  at 4 C for 5 min,
  then the cells were gently washed with 1 mL of cold PBS one time, and the cells
  were resuspended in rhodamine 123 staining solution  in the dark for 30 min. The
  samples were analyzed by flow cytometry.


  The effects of caspase inhibitor on MDA-MB-231 cells were measured by MTT assay
  described above. The cultured cells were seeded in a 96-well plate with a density
  of 2.5  104 cells/well without or with z-VAD-fmk, z-DEVD-fmk, z-LEHD-fmk, and z-IETD-fmk
  at given concentrations for 1 h and then treated with 3.5 M CHUA for another 24
  h. After the treatment, the cell viability was measured by MTT assay.


  MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with 3.5 M CHUA for different time courses as indicated.
  All of the cells were harvested according to the method described by Laetitia et
  al. Briefly, the cells were gently washed with ice-cold PBS and lysated by RIRA
  buffer containing proteinase inhibitor. Protein concentrations were determined by
  the Bio-Rad DC protein assay. Fifteen mirograms of proteins for each channel was
  separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membranes
  were incubated with appropriately diluted primary antibodies, followed by horseradish
  peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies against the corresponding species. Labeling
  was detected using the ECL system.


  Experimental values were expressed as the mean  SEM. The differences between groups
  were assessed by one way-analysis of variance followed by multiple comparisons.
  Statistical significance is expressed as follows: , p ; 0.05; , p &lt; 0.01.


  CHUA was a white powder. The ESI-MS gave the  ion at m/z 601, and its molecular
  formula was drawn as C39H54O5 from HR-MS and 13C NMR. In its 1H NMR, there were
  three groups of characteristic signals of monosubstituted benzene, which showed
  at 8.12, 7.53, and 7.17 ppm, respectively. There was a pair of trans-conjugated
  olefinic protons, which appeared at 8.00  and 6.65 ppm. There were 12 sp2-hybrid
  carbons in the lower field of 13C NMR, which included 2 carbonyl carbons. From its
  1H and 13C NMR and DEPT spectra, a trans-cinnamic acid part could be deduced. In
  the 13C NMR spectra, there were a carbonyl signal at 180.1 ppm and two olefinic
  carbons at 139.7 and 126.1 ppm, which implied there was a carboncarbon double bond
  in the molecule. The results showed that CHUA was a triterpene possessing an ursane
  skeleton. Compared with our former study, the triterpenoid was identified as 3-trans-cinnamoyloxy-2-hydroxy-urs-12-en-28-oic
  acid, which was a novel triterpenoid isolated from apple. The chemical structure
  of CHUA is shown in Figure 1.


  The purity of CHUA was 97.3  5.1%, determined by HPLC method. CHUA was used for
  in vivo and in vitro antitumor studies. It was dissolved in DMSO, and the stock
  solution was diluted with cell culture medium to keep the concentration of DMSO
  &lt;0.1%.


  To examine the in vitro antitumor effects of CHUA, a series of human tumor cell
  lines were treated with various doses of CHUA  for 48 h, and cell viability was
  assayed by MTT method. The inhibitory rates of CHUA against human tumor cell lines
  are shown in Figure 2A. The results suggested that CHUA significantly inhibited
  the cell growth and proliferation of MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, and A549 cell lines with
  IC50 values of 2.57  0.11, 5.45  0.23, and 6.37  0.29 M, respectively. In particular,
  it should be noted that CHUA achieved the best inhibitory effect for MDA-MB-231
  cell lines among the six tumor cell lines. On the basis of these results, MDA-MB-231
  was selected to investigate the in vivo antitumor effects and mechanisms of CHUA
  in subsequent research.

  of CHUA against human tumor cell lines. Different tumor cells were treated by various
  concentrations of CHUA for 48 h, and then the MTT method was used to evaluate the
  cell viability. The values presented are the mean  SEM.  Growth curves of subcutaneous
  tumors in mice treated with CHUA or DMSO. After succeeding in making this model,
  the mice were treated with 50 mg/kg/day CHUA 100 L or the same volume of DMSO. Tumor

  burdened tumors were removed carefully, and weighed. The values presented are the
  mean  SEM.


  CHUA was tested for anti-mammary tumor activity in nude mice on the basis of its
  potent inhibitory activity against the MDA-MB-231 cell line in vitro. To evaluate
  the in vivo antitumor effect of CHUA, growth inhibition of MDA-MB-231 xenografts
  in nude mice was further investigated. Administration of CHUA resulted in significant
  growth suppression of MDA-MB-231 xenografts compared to the control group. As shown
  in Figure 2B, tumor growth in the CHUA-treated group was significantly inhibited
  compared to the control group. The average tumor weight in the CHUA-treated group
  was significantly lighter than that in the control group  at the end of the experiment.
  Also, there were no statistical significant differences in body weights between
  the CHUA-treated and control groups, indicating a low general toxicity of CHUA.


  To determine the characteristics of CHUA-induced MDA-MB-231 cell death, DNA fragmentation
  was examined. DNA fragmentation was obviously observed in CHUA-treated MDA-MB-231
  cells.

  with 3.5 M CHUA at the indicated time. The DNA purified from each sample was separated
  by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis to detect the DNA ladder after drug treatment.


  In the LDH activity assay, the ratio of apoptotic MDA-MB-231 cells increased from
  12.0 to 41.1% in a time-dependent manner. The maximal apoptosis happened at 36 h
  and then reduced quickly; however, the necrosis ratio continued to increase.


  Figure 4. Apoptotic and necrotic ratios in CHUA-treated MDA-MB-231 cells. The cells
  were treated with 3.5 M CHUA at the indicated time. The ratios of LDH released from
  floating dead cells and the culture medium were used to distinguish the proportion
  of apoptotic and necrotic cells. Results are represented as the mean  SEM.


  Mitochondrial Transmembrane Potential  Was Markedly Reduced by CHUA Treatment in
  MDA-MB-231 Cells


  Lots of apoptotic signals are initiated by mitochondria to transduce cell death.
  Depletion of the mitochondria membrane potential  is an early marker of the apoptotic
  process. Changes in the mitochondrial transmembrane potential in CHUA treated with
  MDA-MB-231 cells were analyzed by flow cytometry using the dye rhodamine 123, a
  specific fluorescent probe for analysis of mitochondrial transmembrane potential.
  Compared with the control group, the mitochondrial transmembrane potential was reduced
  after CHUA treatment correlated with time increasing, and the maximal decrease happened
  at 36 h, implying that CHUA-induced MDA-MB-231 cell apoptosis through mitochondrial
  pathway.


  Figure 5. Effect of CHUA on the loss mitochondrial membrane potential on MDA-MB-231
  cells. The cells were treated with 3.5 M CHUA at the indicated time. Both adherent
  and floating cells were collected and incubated with PBS containing 1 g/mL rhodamine
  123. The mitochondrial membrane potential was detected by FCM.


  It is well-known that the mitochondrial pathway is regulated by Bcl-2 family members
  to trigger downstream signaling. To understand the potential antitumor mechanism,
  the apoptosis-related proteins were detected using Western blot method. The data
  showed that the expression of pro-apoptotic Bax and the release of cytochrome c
  began to increase in response to CHUA treatment, whereas the expression levels of
  anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL were down-regulated after 12 h of treatment. These
  results indicated that CHUA induced apoptosis, resulting in an increased ratio of
  Bax/Bcl-XL, accompanied the translocation of cytochrome c from the mitochondria.


  Figure 6. Release of cytochrome c and expressions of Bax, Bcl-2, Bcl-X, p53, and
  SIRT1 in CHUA-induced MDA-MB-231 cells. Cells were treated with 3.5 M CHUA for 0,
  12, 24, 36, or 48 h, the cell lysates  were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE, and the protein
  expressions were detected by Western blot analysis.


  SIRT1 can bind p53 and deacetylates its C-terminus, resulting in inhibition of p53-
  or Bax-mediated apoptosis. To test whether SIRT1 and p53 take part in CHUA-induced
  MDA-MB-231 cell death, Western blot analysis was used to detect the expressions
  of SIRT1 and p53. As shown in Figure 6, the expression level of SIRT1 began to attenuate
  after CHUA treatment for 24 h. As expected, p53 expression was up-regulated in a
  time-dependent manner.


  Many studies have shown that caspases are required in apoptosis. In this study,
  it was found that the inhibitor of pan-caspase  and the inhibitor of caspase-3  augmented
  the cell death to a significant difference. However, the inhibitor of caspase-8  and
  the inhibitor of caspase-9  had no effect on the MDA-MB-231 cell death.


  Figure 7. Effects of caspase on CHUA-induced MDA-MB-231 cell death.  Cells were
  pretreated without or with z-VAD-fmk 10 M, z-DEVD-fmk 20 M, z-IETD-fmk 20 M, or
  z-LEHD-fmk 20 M for 1 h and then treated with 10 M CHUA for another 24 h, and the
  cell death rate was measured by MTT assay. Mean  SEM.  p &lt; 0.01.  Cells were
  treated as in, and then the characteristics of cell death were determined by LDH
  activity-based assay. Mean  SEM.  p &lt; 0.05.  Involvement of caspase-3 independent
  pathway during CHUA-induced apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells. The cells were treated
  with 3.5 M CHUA for the indicated times. The substrates of caspase-3, ICAD, and
  PARP were detected using Western blot analysis.


  In the LDH-based assay, it was found that the inhibitor of pan-caspase can significantly
  increase apoptosis; however, the caspase-3 inhibitor significantly increased necrosis
  on CHUA-treated MDA-MB-231 cells. These results suggested that caspase-3 plays a
  protective role against CHUA-treated MDA-MB-231 cells.


  Caspase exists in normal cells as an inactive enzyme and is activated by removal
  of an aspartic acid residue. Activated caspase exerts the function related with
  apoptosis. Among them, caspase-3 is a common downstream apoptosis effector, which
  is processed and activated by caspase-9 or -8. To further investigate the influence
  of caspase on cells, apoptosis was challenged by CHUA. Western blot analysis was
  carried out to detect whether or not the participation of caspase-3 was involved
  in this process. As we expected, the 32 kDa band of procaspase-3 remained with no
  significant change after treatment with CHUA; also, no active form of caspase-3
  was found. Moreover, ICAD is a classical substrate of caspase-3 and executes the
  characteristic fragmentation of DNA. ICAD is expressed as two isoforms, one is 45
  kDa  and another is 35 kDa. The two isoforms have been reported to bind and inhibit
  CAD, but only ICAD-L/DFF45 has been reported to be functional. Thus, the ICAD-L/DFF45
  expression in MDA-MB-231 cells was examined. Interestingly, after exposure to CHUA
  for different time courses, the expression of ICAD-L remained with no change, too.
  Another characteristic associated with the execution phase of the apoptosis pathway
  is the specific PARP cleavage by the caspase. This cleavage leads to inactivation
  of the enzyme, thus preventing futile DNA repair cycle. It has been reported that
  caspase-3 is the most efficient processing enzyme for PARP. Cleavage of PARP was
  examined after treatment with CHUA. Surprisingly, PARP was activated and formed
  the 85 kDa isoform, which was digested from its 116 kDa precursor in a time-dependent
  manner, indicating that other enzyme activated PARP.


  CHUA is a novel triterpenoid isolated from apple, which has showed potential antitumor
  activity against many types of tumors, especially breast cancer cells. The aim of
  this study was to investigate the effects of CHUA as a chemopreventive agent in
  a nude mouse xenograft model and in vitro experiment. Although CHUA and other plant-derived
  triterpenoids have attracted a lot of interest for cancer study, there has, so far,
  been no study published about CHUA as a dietary supplementation for chemopreventive
  purposes. In this study, CHUA significantly inhibited the cell growth and proliferation
  of different tumor cell lines. In particular, it should be noted that CHUA achieved
  best inhibitory effect for MDA-MB-231 cell lines with the IC50 value of 2.57  0.11
  M. In vivo antitumor experiments showed that CHUA could substantially reduce the
  occurrence and growth of mammary tumor in a nude mouse xenograft model at a dose
  of 50 mg/kg/day without body weight loss and mortality. The inhibition of CHUA on
  solid tumor may be stronger than HBA  with the same dose and the same treatment
  method. As we know, apples are the most common fruit in our daily life, and apple
  peels are a waste product of apple sauce and canned apple manufacture. Rich in triterpenoids,
  they could be of benefit to our health. Triterpenoids form 3 kg of apple peels could
  contribute a sufficient amount of CHUA for chemoprevention for a 100 lb human according
  to animal experiments in vivo. Therefore, CHUA should undergo drug special preparations
  before use as a potential drug.


  The antitumor mechanism of CHUA in MDA-MB-231 cells was further investigated. Apoptosis
  is characterized by a fragmentation of nuclear chromatin and dilatation of the endoplasmic
  reticulum. Results of DNA fragmentation and LDH activity assay suggested that CHUA-induced
  MDA-MB-231 cell death involved a mechanism of apoptosis. The mitochondrial transmembrane
  potential is a characteristic feature of apoptosis. Normally, mitochondria play
  the central role in supplying cells with ATP for survival. Dysfunction of mitochondria
  has been frequently reported in human cancera related with apoptosis because of
  the changes in membrane integrity that resulted in the disruption of the mitochondrial
  transmembrane potential. In this research, the mitochondrial transmembrane potential
  on MDA-MB-231 cells treated by CHUA was decreased in a time-dependent manner. This
  result implied that the mitochondrial pathway might be involved in MDA-MB-231 cell
  apoptosis.


  As we know, the collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential correlates with
  an increased expression of Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, which is followed by cytochrome c release.
  Therefore, the ratio between Bcl-2 and Bax or Bcl-XL and Bax is a decisive factor
  to activate cell death. Were these proteins involved or not in this apoptotic process?
  The results showed that MDA-MB-231 cells treated with CHUA exhibited the elevated
  ratio between Bax and Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL. Meanwhile, the release of cytochrome c was
  obviously up-regulated followed by the increased ratios. These results strongly
  suggested that the mitochondrial pathway was activated in CHUA-induced apoptosis
  on MDA-MB-231 cells.


  p53 is a major regulator of apoptosis through different points. It may transcriptionally
  activate genes that are essential to growth arrest and DNA damage. It can also activate
  the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family number Bax. As Bax expression increased, our attention
  was drawn to p53 because Bax is a gene promoter containing a p53-binding domain
  and is up-regulated by p53 in response to DNA damage. Moreover, Bax links p53 with
  apoptotic machinery of mitochondia, which results in the release of cytochrome c
  and activation of caspases. In this study, CHUA induced rapid accumulation of p53,
  which was positively correlated with subsequent up-regulation of Bax. These results
  indicate that p53 plays a pivotal role in the initiation phase of CHUA-induced MDA-MB-231
  cell apoptosis.


  SIRT1 has been proposed to promote tumor development and progression; also, SIRT1-mediated
  deacetylation suppresses the functions of several tumor suppressors, including p53.
  It also inhibits apoptotic cell death by deacetylating the DNA repair factor Ku70
  that is tightly associated with Bax, resulting in the change of the mitochondrial
  permeability. In this study, CHUA attenuated SIRT1 expression and triggered the
  activation of p53 and Bax, suggesting that SIRT1 inactivation was associated with
  p53- and Bax-mediated cell death by CHUA.


  UV irradiation and some chemotherapeutic agents cause release of mitochondrial cytochrome
  c, which binds to Apaf-1, and the complex mediates recruitment of procaspase-9 and
  activates caspase-3. Caspases, a family of proteases, are one of the essential executioners
  of apoptosis, and their cleavage and subsequent activation are considered the primary
  hallmarks of apoptosis; however, there have been other reports that cell death is
  increased even when its function is shut down. To further confirm the participation
  of caspase in cell death, different caspase inhibitors were used in the experiment.
  Interestingly, the results of this study showed that pretreatment with the caspase
  inhibitors z-VAD-fmk  and z-DEVD-fmk  significantly enhanced CHUA-induced MDA-MB-231
  cell death, but the z-IETD-fmk  and z-LEAD-fmk  had almost no effect on cell viability,
  which implied that caspase-independent apoptosis happened. In the LDH assay, pretreatment
  with z-DEVD-fmk  significantly enhanced CHUA-induced MDA-MB-231 cell death after
  CHUA treatment. With this special question, we further examined the protein expression
  of caspase-3 and its substrates of ICAD and PARP. ICAD was left unaffected because
  no active form of caspase-3 was detected after CHUA treatment; however, cleaved
  PARP was detected, indicating that other proteins contribute to cell death and PARP
  activation in part. All data here allowed us to speculate that other enzymes existed
  to induce the apoptotic signals on MDA-MB-231 cells treated by CHUA.


  Taken together, CHUA induced apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells via mitochondrial pathways,
  and some proteases different from caspase-3 might be responsible for the degradation
  of PARP. A more detailed mechanism of CHUA-induced MDA-MB-231 cell apoptosis remains
  to be elucidated.
