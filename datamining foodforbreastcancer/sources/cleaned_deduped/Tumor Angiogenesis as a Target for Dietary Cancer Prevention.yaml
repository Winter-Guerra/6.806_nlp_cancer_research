  Angiogenesis as a Target for Dietary Cancer Prevention.md
text: "\n\nBetween 2000 and 2050, the number of new cancer patients diagnosed annually
  is expected to double, with an accompanying increase in treatment costs of more
  than $80 billion over just the next decade. Efficacious strategies for cancer prevention
  will therefore be vital for improving patients quality of life and reducing healthcare
  costs. Judah Folkman first proposed antiangiogenesis as a strategy for preventing
  dormant microtumors from progressing to invasive cancer. Although antiangiogenic
  drugs are now available for many advanced malignancies, cost and toxicity considerations
  preclude their broad use for cancer prevention. Potent antiangiogenic molecules
  have now been identified in dietary sources, suggesting that a rationally designed
  antiangiogenic diet could provide a safe, widely available, and novel strategy for
  preventing cancer. This paper presents the scientific, epidemiologic, and clinical
  evidence supporting the role of an antiangiogenic diet for cancer prevention.\n\nCancer
  now affects as many as 24 million people worldwide, and results in over six million
  deaths each year. In the United States, men and women have a 43% and 38% chance,
  respectively, of being diagnosed with any type of cancer during their lifetime.
  Despite advances in the early detection of cancer, most malignancies are still diagnosed
  and treated at advanced stages, with a limited range of therapeutic options and
  poor overall survival. Simultaneously, cancer treatment costs are escalating, from
  $125 billion annually in the US in 2010 to a projected $207 billion by 2020. Cancer
  prevention is, thus, a key opportunity for managing the cancer pandemic. Unlike
  interventional approaches delivered to patients diagnosed with advanced cancer,
  preventative strategies must be suitable for healthy individuals and have low systemic
  toxicity, inhibiting microscopic tumor growth with minimal adverse effects on healthy
  tissues.\n\nIt is now well established that solid tumor growth is dependent upon
  angiogenesis, the growth of new blood vessels. During early stages of tumorigenesis,
  the induction of angiogenesis by cancer cells is a critical event separating the
  preinvasive and dormant form of cancer from the invasive and metastatic phases of
  malignant growth. Multiple studies have demonstrated that the degree of tumor vascularity
  correlates positively with disease stage, the likelihood of metastases, and cancer
  recurrence. Angiogenesis also plays a role in hematogenous malignancies, such as
  leukemia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma, as well as in premalignant myelodysplastic
  syndromes. In these pathologies, vascular endothelial cells sustain and promote
  malignant cell growth by secreting paracrine survival factors. \n\nAntiangiogenic
  therapy has been validated as an effective cancer treatment strategy for a growing
  number of cancer types, including colorectal, renal, liver, lung, brain, pancreatic
  neuroendocrine tumors, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, multiple myeloma, and myelodysplastic
  syndrome. More than 120 novel antiangiogenic agents are in clinical, trials. Importantly,
  a growing body of preclinical, clinical and epidemiological data is demonstrating
  that angiogenesis inhibition can be applied for achieving cancer prevention. This
  paper presents the scientific and clinical evidence supporting antiangiogenesis
  as a rational strategy for the prevention of cancer, exploiting factors that are
  naturally present in dietary sources.\n\nThe human body contains 60,000 miles of
  blood vessels, including 19 billion capillaries. All normal cells in the body are
  located no further than 100-200 m from the nearest capillary, the diffusion limit
  of oxygen. Capillaries not only deliver oxygen and micronutrients to tissues, but
  the endothelial cells comprising them secrete paracrine growth and survival signals
  that influence adjacent nonvascular cells. Under physiological conditions, the rate
  of cell proliferation is balanced with the rate of cell death, so there is no net
  tissue growth. Expansion of tissue mass requires angiogenesis to support increased
  metabolic demand. In normal healthy adults, angiogenesis is constitutively suppressed
  except for brief bursts during the female reproductive cycle, pregnancy, and wound
  healing. The physiological state is thus maintained in a constitutive state of suppressed
  angiogenesis by endogenous inhibitory mechanisms opposing the action of angiogenic
  growth and other stimulating factors.\n\nMore than 30 endogenous molecules have
  been identified as angiogenic factors. These share the ability to stimulate neovascularization
  in vivo and induce endothelial proliferation, migration, or capillary tube formation
  in vitro. Basic fibroblast growth factor  was the first angiogenic factor to be
  identified from a tumor extract, but vascular endothelial growth factor/vascular
  permeability factor  is the best studied. VEGF is a potent endothelial mitogen that
  increases vascular permeability, and also induces Bcl-2, promoting vascular survival.
  VEGF is expressed by all human tumors studied and its receptors  are expressed selectively
  on angiogenic endothelial cells. Placental growth factor  plays a specific role
  in pathological neovascularization by recruiting bone marrow-derived vascular stem
  cells to disease sites. Other factors include platelet-derived growth factor, platelet-derived
  endothelial cell growth factor, interleukin-3, interleukin-8, transforming growth
  factor-, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Other angiogenic factors are neuregulin,
  a ligand for the ErbB receptor, and keratinocyte growth factor. Angiogenic factors
  are observed at low levels or undetectable in the circulation in normal, healthy
  subjects. By contrast, markedly elevated levels of factors such as bFGF, VEGF, and
  PD-ECGF are present in the serum, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid of cancer patients.\n\nAngiogenesis
  inhibitory activity was first discovered in studies of cartilage, a naturally avascular
  tissue. Numerous endogenous antiangiogenic molecules have subsequently been identified,
  including troponin-1, tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases, chondromodulin
  I, connective tissue-growth factor, decorin, metastatin, pigment epithelium-derived
  factor  thrombospondin-1 and -2, interferons, tetrahydrocortisol-S, platelet factor-4,
  and protamine. Other inhibitors, such as canstatin, tumstatin, and arresten, are
  present in the basement membrane surrounding established blood vessels.\n\nA separate
  and distinct class of inhibitors is comprised of proteolytic fragments derived from
  cleaved larger molecules. Angiostatin is an internal fragment of plasminogen and
  specifically inhibits endothelial cell proliferation. Enzymes such as macrophage-derived
  elastase and serine proteases generate angiostatin or angiostatin-like fragments.
  Endostatin, a 20-kDa fragment of collagen XVIII, is a specific angiogenesis inhibitor
  that induces endothelial apoptosis. Both angiostatin and endostatin were discovered
  in the serum of tumor-bearing experimental mice, suggesting that tumor-associated
  protease activity generates these inhibitors. Removal of the primary tumor led to
  a marked decline in serum angiostatin and endostatin, followed by rapid angiogenic
  growth of metastatic lesions. Endostatin is present at a low circulating level in
  normal subjects. Collectively, these endogenous angiogenesis inhibitors play a dominant
  role in suppressing angiogenesis in health and contribute to tumor dormancy.\n\nVascular
  growth is physiologically governed by a homeostatic balance between positive and
  negative angiogenesis regulators, so that neovascularization is normally suppressed.
  Vascular proliferation occurs when angiogenic growth factor production is upregulated,
  or when expression of endogenous inhibitors is downregulated, or when both events
  occur simultaneously. The genetic regulators of angiogenesis are closely related
  to tumor growth promotion and suppression. Gene knockout studies in mice have shown
  that Id1 and Id3, peptides that control cell differentiation by interfering with
  DNA binding of transcription factors, are required for normal vascular formation
  and induction of angiogenesis in tumor-bearing animals. The activated forms of the
  oncogenes H-ras, v-raf, c-myc, c-src, Her-2/neu, and p73 are associated with cellular
  production of VEGF as well as tumorigenesis. Several tumor-suppressor genes regulate
  angiogenesis inhibition, including p53, Rb, vHL, phosphatase and tensin homolog,
  and trk B  Wild-type p53 controls expression of the angiogenesis inhibitor thrombospondin
  and decreases tumor neovascularization; mutant p53 leads to the opposite effect.
  The retinoblastoma  gene and the von Hippel-Lindau  gene both downregulate VEGF
  expression; their mutation leads to VEGF production, angiogenesis, and tumor growth.\n\nMicroscopic
  cancer cells are commonly present in the healthy adult, the result of errors during
  replication of 60-90 trillion cells. To acquire sustenance, the incipient tumors
  \ may migrate toward existing host vessels, a process known as vessel cooption,
  but their growth remains limited. Tumors are capable of growth to approx 0.5 mm3
  in diameter  before reaching a steady state of growth. Beyond this size, their metabolic
  demands exceed the supply of oxygen and nutrients obtained by passive diffusion
  from nearby blood vessels. This state corresponds to carcinoma in situ, and the
  rate of tumor cell proliferation is balanced by apoptosis. Such microscopic tumors
  may exist for years without clinical detection.\n\nAutopsy studies have shown that
  these microscopic cancers are present in the breasts of up to 40% of women between
  the ages of 40 and 50 years, and in 50% of prostates in men between 50 and 60 years.
  By age 70, microscopic cancers are detected in the thyroids of virtually everyone.
  Most of these tumors never become clinically significant, leading to the concept
  of cancer without disease as a normal state during aging. Physiological angiogenesis
  inhibition is regarded as one of the mechanisms that prevent microscopic cancers
  from converting to a malignant phenotype.\n\nTo expand beyond the limits of the
  preexisting vascular supply, tumors recruit new blood vessels from surrounding vessels,
  an event known as the switch to the angiogenic phenotype. Three classic studies
  employing transgenic mice have delineated this switch as normal cells undergo the
  transition from normalcy to hyperplasia to dysplasia, and finally to frank carcinoma.\n\nFigure
  1: The switch to the angiogenic phenotype occurs during multistage tumorigenesis.
  As malignancy develops, cells progress from a prevascular stage  to a vascular stage.
  Angiogenesis becomes clearly evident during dysplasia and is critical for further
  growth. Targeting tumor angiogenesis may be a novel strategy for preventing cancer..\n\nIn
  a model of spontaneous   -islet cell tumor formation, Rip1-Tag2 transgenic mice
  selectively express the SV40 T-antigen oncogene in their insulin producing  cells
  and undergo a predictable sequence of multistep tumorigenesis. The transformed -cells
  are localized to approx 400 islets in the pancreas, of which 100% express the oncogene.
  Over time, 50-70% of these islets become hyperplastic nodules. A distinct angiogenic
  stage occurs at 6-7 wk of age between the hyperplastic stage and the time at which
  subset islets become invasive carcinomas at 12-16 weeks. The angiogenic capacity
  of these lesions is observed as visible intense tumor vascularization, accompanied
  by induction of capillary sprouting, endothelial proliferation, and a starburst-like
  convergence of capillaries when islets are harvested in vivo and cocultured with
  endothelial cells in vitro. Importantly, nonangiogenic islets are unable to grow
  beyond 0.6-0.8 mm3 in size, whereas the small subset of angiogenic islets can expand
  into a lethal tumor burden.\n\nA second study utilized the bovine papillomavirus
  oncogene in a transgenic mouse model of dermal fibrosarcoma. Distinct stages of
  tumorigenesis are observed, from normal cells to a proliferative hyperplastic stage
  \ to neoplasia. The preneoplastic fibromas grow horizontally within the dermis as
  thin avascular lesions, and the fibrosarcomas are expansile and densely vascularized.
  Angiogenesis is first observed during the late preneoplastic stage  and sustained
  until death of the animals by fibrosarcoma. Aggressive fibromas and fibrosarcomas
  secrete bFGF. By contrast, bFGF is not secreted by normal cells or by mild fibromas.\n\nA
  third study involved K14-HPV16 transgenic mice in which the human papillomavirus
  \ type 16 oncogene is targeted to expression in basal cells of the epidermis by
  regulatory elements of the human keratin-14 promoter. These basal keratinocytes
  undergo sequential changes from normal cells  to hyperplasia  to dysplasia  to squamous
  cell carcinoma. In hyperplasia, dysplasia, and at the invading cancer front, angiogenesis
  is associated with mast cell infiltration and degranulation. Mast cells contain
  numerous angiogenic stimulators in their secretory granules, such as the serine
  protease MCP-4, VEGF, bFGF, TGF, TNF, and IL-8. In dysplasia and carcinoma, tissue
  expression of VEGF was increased, correlating to increased tumor vessel density.\n\nTogether,
  these data demonstrate that angiogenesis is a discrete, genetically regulated and
  rate-limiting step during multistep tumorigenesis, that the transition from prevascular
  to vascular phase is accompanied by the production and release of one or more angiogenic
  growth factors, and that host inflammatory cells may amplify the angiogenic switch
  by contributing additional stimuli.\n\nThe onset of angiogenesis precedes an exponential
  phase of tumor growth accompanied by local organ invasion. The velocity of angiogenic
  capillary growth ranges from 0.223 to 0.8 mm/day. Studies of avascular tumor explants
  placed in the anterior chamber of the eye show that once new vessels reach the explant,
  tumors can expand 16,000-fold in size in 2 wk. During this expansion, cancer cells
  grow as a cuff around each new microvessel with a thickness of 50-200 m. In this
  configuration, one endothelial cell supports the metabolic needs of 5-100 cancer
  cells. Eventually, invading blood vessels occupy 1.5% of the tumor volume. Tumor
  angiogenesis also facilitates cancer metastases by allowing cells to exit through
  the neovascular network into the systemic circulation. Elegant studies of mammary
  carcinomas in mice have shown that a 1 cm tumor sheds up to 4  10  6 malignant cells
  into the circulation every 24 h.\n\nThe concept of antiangiogenesis was first proposed
  in 1971 by Judah Folkman, who hypothesized that inhibition of neovascularization
  at an early stage of cancer development could prevent tumor growth and metastases
  and maintain tumor dormancy. A vast literature establishes that angiogenesis inhibition
  is an effective strategy to restrict cancer growth in animal models bearing a wide
  variety of cancers. To date, more than 300 angiogenesis-inhibitory molecules have
  been identified as potential drug candidates, including many natural and synthetic
  chemical entities. Selective targeting of angiogenic blood vessels is possible as
  a result of differential proliferation rates between normal and tumor-associated
  endothelium. The normal vasculature is highly quiescent, with only one in every
  10,000 endothelial cells dividing at any given time, and a physiological doubling
  time ranging from 47 to 20,000 days. In contrast, the doubling rate for tumor endothelium
  is 2-13 days. Thus, antiangiogenic agents are selective in inhibiting proliferating
  tumor vasculature, but do not affect normal blood vessels. \n\nSpecific molecular
  and cellular targets have been identified for tumor angiogenesis. These include
  targets present during the orderly events characterizing new blood vessel growth.
  These include  angiogenic growth factor production, release, and receptor activation,
  \ degradation of vascular basement membrane,  endothelial proliferation, migration,
  and survival,  blood vessel sprouting and invasion,  tubular morphogenesis,  arterial-venous
  patterning,  vascular maturation, and  recruitment of endothelial stem cells.\n\nThe
  clinical development of antiangiogenic therapy began in the late 1980s. The first
  successful treatment of a vascular tumor  occurred in 1989 using interferon- 2a
  as an antiendothelial agent. The first drug to enter formal clinical trials as an
  angiogenesis inhibitor was TNP-470 in 1992. Since 2004, more than 14 different antiangiogenic
  agents have been demonstrated to be efficacious in treating solid and hematogenous
  cancers, primarily in the setting of advanced disease. To date, most agents that
  are specific or selective for angiogenesis are well tolerated in humans, with fewer
  serious  toxicities observed in their clinical trials when compared to cytotoxic
  chemotherapy drugs. Because only proliferating endothelium is targeted, the traditional
  side effects of chemotherapy, such as leukopenia, alopecia, and mucositis, are rarely
  observed. With some antiangiogenic agents, a maximum tolerated dose  cannot be determined.
  This has led some clinical investigations to incorporate pharmacodynamic techniques
  for determining the optimal biological dose  of agents in clinical trials.\n\nCollectively,
  translational research studies have shown that overall disease burden is important
  to consider in the evaluation of the clinical effects of any antiangiogenic agent.
  Advanced cancers contain well-established, extensive vascular networks that may
  respond minimally to angiogenesis inhibitors. Vascular destructive agents, also
  known as vascular targeting agents, may be required to achieve a clinically significant
  effect on tumor perfusion. Indeed, most preclinical studies of angiogenesis inhibitors
  demonstrate drug efficacy in the setting of incipient disease  or small tumors.
  Clinical trials of the same agents, however, have often enrolled patients with advanced,
  metastastic, and heavily pretreated disease, perhaps explaining differences between
  mice studies and the results of human trials. Antiangiogenic therapy in the adjuvant
  setting to suppress minimal residual disease, or as an intervention for early-stage
  disease or cancer prevention, has been proposed as the scenario of the greatest
  clinical benefit using angiogenesis inhibitors.\n\nThe remainder of this paper is
  devoted to discussing the potential for angiogenesis inhibitors for prevention of
  cancer.\n\nAngiogenesis inhibition offers an opportunity to interrupt an early,
  rate-limiting step in tumorigenesis. Suppression of pathological blood-vessel growth
  prevents early tumors from progressing to the malignant phenotype. Clinical correlates
  to preinvasive angiogenic lesions are commonly encountered in breast, cervix, skin,
  oropharynx, lung, colon, and prostate. Microscopic metastases are also present in
  many cancer patients who are undergoing tumor resection with curative intent. For
  example, 25% of colon cancer patients eventually develop hepatic metastases after
  primary tumor resection emerging from preangiogenic lesions that were present at
  the time of surgery. By suppressing tumor neovascularization at subclinical stages,
  tumor progression and metastatic growth may be halted.\n\nAnimal studies have demonstrated
  that early administration of angiogenesis inhibitors is highly efficacious. The
  drug TNP-470  is a potent antiangiogenic analog of the antibiotic fumagillin. A
  rat model of liver metastasis using K12/TRb rat colon adenocarcinoma cells was employed
  to study the differential efficacy of early, early prolonged, or delayed administration
  of TNP-470  on metastatic burden and survival. Treatment initiated at d1 after tumor
  inoculation  and maintained for 28d  led to a 46% reduction in liver metastases
  and improved survival time compared to controls. Another study showed a superior
  reduction in metastases with early  compared to delayed  TNP-470 treatment in rabbits
  bearing VX2 carcinoma.\n\nThe effect of TNP-470 on subclinical disease has also
  been elegantly studied by Shusterman and colleagues. In the first study, xenografts
  of human neuroblastoma-derived CHP-134 were implanted into athymic  mice, with initiation
  of antiangiogenic treatment 12 h following grafting. Treated tumors were reduced
  by 90%, compared to control animals. The second study involved administration of
  TNP-470 12 h following tail vein injection of CHP-134 cells into SCID/Beige mice.
  Autopsy of saline-treated control mice showed neuroblastoma deposits in the kidney,
  liver, adrenal gland, and ovaries in 75% of subjects, whereas TNP-470-treated mice
  showed no evidence of metastases. A third study evaluated TNP-470 effects in mice
  whose tumors were initially 0.35 mm3, but then became difficult to palpate following
  10 d of cyclophosphamide treatment. TNP-470 was then administered subcutaneously.
  Tumor growth was suppressed in the TNP-470-treated group by 82%, compared to saline-treated
  controls. Histopathological analyses showed increased apoptosis by TdT-mediated
  nick-end labeling  assay in treated animals, but no with difference in tumor cell
  proliferation by Ki-67 assessment. These data demonstrate the importance of timing
  in antiangiogenic therapy and its efficacy in subclinical disease.\n\nCancer chemoprevention
  is defined as the use of pharmacological, natural, or dietary agents to inhibit
  the development of invasive cancer by blocking DNA damage caused by carcinogens
  or by arresting the progression of premalignant cells after damage has already occurred.
  Angiogenesis inhibition blocks carcinogenesis by preventing progression to the invasive
  phenotype. A number of well-known chemopreventive agents have antiangiogenic properties
  in vivo and in vitro. These include retinoids, vitamin D3, tamoxifen, oltipraz,
  curcumin, linoleic acid, ellagic acid, selenium, -difluoromethylornithine, N-acetyl-l-cysteine,
  catechins, and celecoxib. Classical angiogenesis assay systems, such as the chorioallantoic
  membrane assay, the corneal micropocket assay, and modified rat aortic ring assay,
  have been used to screen for biological activity of established chemopreventive
  agents. Known angiogenesis inhibitors such as endostatin have also been shown to
  suppress carcinogen-induced tumor development in rodent models. The antiangiogenic
  properties of select chemopreventive molecules shall be discussed.\n\nAfter water,
  tea is the second most popular liquid in the world, and its consumption is linked
  with a decreased risk of colon, prostate, lung, esophageal, and other cancers. Laboratory
  studies have demonstrated that green tea and its catechins prevent mutagenesis,
  tumorigenesis, cancer invasion and metastases, and angiogenesis. Polyphenol catechins
  in tea, predominantly flavanols, possess chemopreventive and antiangiogenic activity.
  Epigallocatechin-3-gallate  is a potent tea flavonoid that specifically inhibits
  endothelial cell proliferation stimulated by bFGF and induces avascular zones in
  the chick CAM assay. Mice that consume 1.25% green tea  show inhibition of VEGF-stimulated
  corneal neovascularization by as much as 70% and reduction of tumor cell invasion
  by 50%. Green tea solution 0.6% administered to mice as the sole source of drinking
  fluid results in less tissue VEGF expression seen by immunostaining and lower microvessel
  density in lung adenomas, as well as significantly fewer tumors induced by the NNK
  carcinogen.\n\nThe molecular mechanism of EGCG is the result of its inhibition of
  urokinase and two gelatinases  involved in vascular as well as tumor invasion. The
  MMP inhibitory activity is independent of zinc or calcium binding by EGCG. High
  doses of EGCG induce apoptosis when topically applied to SKH-1 hairless mice bearing
  UVB-induced squamous cell carcinomas. Clinical trials are underway in Western and
  Asian nations to study the chemopreventive potential of green tea for oral, prostate,
  skin, and other cancers.\n\nPreliminary data from these trials suggest clinical
  efficacy. An Italian study involving men with high-grade prostate intraepithelial
  neoplasia  demonstrated a protective effect from consuming daily green tea catechins
  over the course of a single year. The double-blind, placebo-control study randomized
  sixty men with HGPIN into a treatment arm receiving 600 mg of purified green tea
  catechins  and a placebo arm. The men were followed for one year, at which point
  they underwent prostate mapping via core needle biopsies. Based on those biopsy
  results, 30% of the placebo group progressed to prostate cancer, while the treatment
  arm demonstrated an impressively low progression rate of 3%. Similarly, a Japanese
  interventional study of patients with recently removed colonic adenomas demonstrated
  that participants drinking an average of 12 cups equivalent of green tea polyphenols,
  obtained through both purified extracts and whole tea, had a 50% reduction in risk
  of adenoma recurrence compared to patients who drank an average of six cups of green
  tea. Chemopreventive effects in humans have also been observed through experimental
  trials involving the treatment of precancerous oral and cervical lesions.\n\nPolyphenon
  E, an extract from green tea leaves containing a defined mixture of polyphenolic
  catechins, is in clinical trials for prostate, bladder, esophageal, lung, head and
  neck cancers, and leukemia. In topical form, Polyphenon E 15% ointment was approved
  by the U.S. FDA in 2006 as a treatment for external genital warts, which is considered
  an angiogenic neoplasm and a precursor to cervical cancer.\n\nGenistein, an isoflavonoid
  found in soybeans, has both chemopreventive and antiangiogenic activity. It suppresses
  carcinogenesis in a variety of animal models of mammary and prostate carcinoma following
  oral and parenteral administration. Multiple antitumor mechanisms of action have
  been identified, including angiogenesis inhibition, induction of apoptosis, G2 cell
  cycle arrest, inhibition of c-fos expression and NF-B activation, modulation of
  sex steroid receptors and growth factor signaling pathways. Genistein inhibits angiogenesis
  by the following mechanisms: inhibition of bFGF- and VEGF-driven endothelial cell
  proliferation, migration, and tube formation; inhibition of extracellular matrix
  degradation by suppression of bFGF-induced endothelial production of plasminogen
  activator  and plasminogen activator inhibitor ; and suppression of receptor tyrosine
  kinase activity for VEGF, EGF, and PDGF.\n\nThe antiangiogenic activity of genistein
  was initially detected in a study of healthy Japanese individuals who consumed a
  traditional soy-rich Japanese diet. Urine from these subjects was collected, fractionated,
  and examined for activity to inhibit bFGF-stimulated endothelial cell proliferation.
  Of two fractions with antiendothelial activity, one contained genistein, daidzein,
  and O-desmethylangolensin. The impact of dietary soy intake was significant. In
  men who consumed a Japanese versus Western diet, urinary genistein was 7052 nmol/day
  compared to 184.4 nmol/day, respectively. Soy intake has been shown to be inversely
  associated with cancer risk. Historically, breast cancer incidence rates have been
  4 to 7 times higher among white women in the US compared to in women in China or
  Japan. However, when Asian women migrate to the US, their breast cancer risk rises
  over several generations to reach that of US white women, suggesting that modifiable
  factors, such as diet, rather than genetics, are responsible for the international
  differences. A study of over 73,000 women in China showed that daily intake of soy
  products such as soy milk, tofu, and fresh soybeans decreased premenopausal breast
  cancer risk. Likewise, American women of Asian descent who consume a traditional
  soy-based diet have a low incidence of breast cancer. Early soy intake  during childhood
  was found to reduce later breast cancer risk by 58% in a study of Asian women in
  California and Hawaii. Similarly, Japanese men in Hawaii who consume a high soy
  diet have low mortality from prostate cancer, although the incidence at autopsy
  of in situ prostate neoplasia is similar to men in Western societies. Based on laboratory
  findings and epidemiological data, genistein and a manufactured derivative known
  as genistein-concentrated polysaccharide, are being evaluated in prevention trials
  for prostate cancer.\n\nSuch clinical studies have helped dispel the theoretical
  concerns that soy intake may worsen breast cancer or interact with tamoxifen treatment
  due to the fact that genistein is a phytoestrogen. In fact, among women with breast
  cancer, soy food consumption has now been shown in numerous, large-scale studies
  to be significantly associated with decreased risk of death and recurrence, regardless
  of estrogen receptor status or tamoxifen use.\n\nResveratrol  is a natural phytoalexin
  and polyphenol found in more than 72 plant species, such as mulberries, peanuts,
  grapes, and grape products, including red and rose wine. Fresh grape skins contain
  50-100 g resveratrol per g and yield a concentration in Italian red wine of 1.5-3
  mg/L. White wine contains minimal levels of resveratrol. Resveratrol inhibits angiogenesis
  in the chick CAM assay, suppresses VEGF- and bFGF-induced corneal neovascularization,
  and inhibits tumor vascularization in T241 fibrosarcoma growing in mice. Resveratrol
  also inhibits chemically induced mammary carcinogenesis, skin cancer tumorigenesis,
  and tumor growth and metastasis in mice bearing Lewis lung carcinoma. In mice with
  full thickness skin wounds, resveratrol delays wound healing angiogenesis and the
  time required for complete wound closure. A number of antiangiogenic mechanisms
  have been identified, including suppression of capillary tube formation inhibition
  of endothelial cell DNA synthesis and binding of VEGF to human endothelial cells
  reduction of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1  interference with phosphorylation
  of endothelial mitogen-activated kinases; suppression of COX-2 enzyme and inhibition
  of MMP-9 expression.\n\nRed wine in particular has been repeatedly shown to have
  protective effects in large population studies. The California Mens Health study
  of over 84,000 men demonstrated an inverse relationship between red wine consumption
  and lung cancer incidence. Notably, there was a 61% risk reduction for men drinking
  at least one glass of red wine per day. This protective benefit for lung cancer
  with greater than one glass per day was replicated in a Spanish population, using
  a case-control methodology involving hospitalized lung cancer patients. Additionally,
  the Health Professionals Follow-up Study identified a protective effect for prostate
  cancer with a 36% risk reduction in men drinking 2-4 glasses of red wine per week.\n\nLycopene,
  a type of natural pigment in the carotenoid family, gives tomatoes and other fruits
  such as watermelon and papayas their bright red color. Lycopene is an angiogenesis
  inhibitor which suppresses signaling by PDGF and Platelet Activation Factor in vitro.
  In animal studies, lycopene suppresses spontaneous mammary tumors, hepatocarcinogenesis,
  colonic crypt foci, prostate cancer, and hepatoma metastases.\n\nTwo interventional
  studies have also demonstrated potent biologic effects of lycopene in the setting
  of malignancy. In one study, 32 men who were recently diagnosed with early-stage
  prostate cancer were instructed to eat one meal per day incorporating commercially
  made tomato sauce containing 30 mg of lycopene for 3 weeks. They then underwent
  curative prostatectomy; pathologic examination of the resected tissue showed a 3-fold
  increase of lycopene concentration in the prostate tissue, along with a slight decrease
  in blood prostate-specific antigen  level. In a separate study, 41 men with recurrent
  prostate cancer were asked to consume a tomato-rich diet to achieve a minimum lycopene
  intake of 25 mg/day along with 40 g/day of soy protein for a total of 8 weeks. While
  the study design made it difficult to separate the dietary effects of lycopene from
  soy, it is notable that the mean serum VEGF levels of all the subjects was reduced
  from 87 to 51 ng/mL in a statistically significant way, and that 34% of the men
  experienced reduced PSA levels.\n\nIn the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study of
  over 51,000 men, the highest quintile of lycopene consumption was found to have
  a 15% risk reduction for developing prostate cancer compared to men in the lowest
  quintile. The risk reduction was even greater if tomato sauce was ingested; men
  consuming more than 2 servings/week had a nearly 23% risk reduction compared to
  men consuming less than 1 serving/month.\n\nOmega-3 fatty acids are unsaturated
  fatty acids that are vital for normal metabolism but cannot be synthesized by the
  human body. The best known sources of the long-chain omega-3 fatty acids--docosahexaenoic
  acid  and eicosapentaenoic --are cold water oily fish such as salmon, herring, mackerel,
  anchovies, sardines, and trout. Both preclinical and epidemiological studies suggest
  that omega-3 PUFAs are effective cancer preventative agents. Omega-3 PUFAs inhibit
  angiogenesis by downregulating angiopoietin-2 and may competitively inhibit the
  bioconversion of omega-6 PUFAs into their angiogenesis-promoting derivatives such
  as prostaglandins and arachidonic acid. In contrast, omega-6 PUFAs, present at high
  levels in sunflower oil, peanut oil, and corn oils, have been shown in vitro to
  stimulate endothelial migration and tube formation. Furthermore, omega-3 PUFAs have
  been shown to suppress Akt/m-TOR signaling pathway. In animal models, Omega-3 fatty
  acids have been shown to suppress a variety of tumors and to prevent osteolytic
  metastastic lesions in bone from breast cancer.\n\nIntake of omega-3 PUFAs from
  seafood has been associated with a decreased risk for certain cancers, including
  pancreatic, colon, breast, and prostate cancer. In a case-control study of 532 people
  diagnosed with pancreatic adenocarcinoma, consumption of omega-3 fatty acid of at
  least 0.85 g/day was associated with a decreased risk of pancreatic cancer; those
  with the highest intake had a 30% risk reduction. A meta-analysis of fish intake
  and prostate cancer in case-control and cohort studies revealed no association between
  fish consumption and prostate cancer incidence, but showed a significant 63% reduction
  in prostate cancer mortality.\n\nCruciferous vegetables--which include cabbage,
  broccoli, cauliflower, collard greens, mustard greens, radishes, Brussel sprouts,
  bok choy, and kale--are rich in glucosinolates, a mustard oil glycoside that imparts
  a spicy, bitter flavor. The enzyme myrosinase--stored in a separate compartment
  of the plant cell and liberated when the plant is crushed--converts glucosinolate
  to the bioactive molecules isothiocyanate and indole-3-carbinol, both of which are
  antiangiogenic. Sulforaphane, a type of isothiocyanate, acts through inactivation
  of hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha, activation of FOXO transcription factors, and
  promotion of endothelial cell apoptosis. Indole-3-carbinol inhibits endothelial
  cell proliferation, tube formation and induces apoptosis.\n\nEpidemiological evidence
  suggests that regular dietary intake of cruciferous vegetables may lower the risk
  of developing several cancers. A major prospective dietary study, the European Prospective
  Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition, followed the dietary habits and health
  of 521,468 subjects in 10 European countries between 1991-2000. After an average
  followup of 8.7 years, 1,830 people were diagnosed with lung cancer. Regular consumption
  of cauliflower and cabbage by current smokers was associated with a 23% reduction
  in the risk for squamous cells carcinoma of the lung. The study also found an almost
  50% reduced risk of cancer of the upper digestive tract  among people who ate the
  most cauliflower and cabbage  compared with those who ate the least.\n\nAnother
  large prospective study of more than 35,000 women living in Iowa and followed for
  20 years found a 18% reduced risk for non-Hodgkins lymphoma  among women who had
  the highest consumption of cruciferous vegetables; in particular, consumption of
  at least 4 servings/month or broccoli was associated with a 28% risk reduction for
  non-Hodgkins lymphoma. In separate study of nearly 67,000 women in the Nurses Health
  Study, more frequent dietary intake of broccoli  was associated with a 33% risk
  reduction for ovarian cancer.\n\nFlavonoids are a family of polyphenols that serve
  as important plant pigments. Their natural roles may include acting as photoprotectants,
  antimicrobials, deterrents against herbivores, as well as attractants to pollinators
  and seed dispersant animals. They are subcategorized by chemical structure into
  flavones, flavonols, anthocyanidins, proanthocyanidins, ellagic acid, ellagitannins,
  and isoflavones, among others. In contrast, the term flavanol specifically refers
  to the catechins, mentioned earlier. \n\nFlavonoids in fruits and vegetables include
  quercetin, anthocyanidins, proanthocyanidins, ellagitannins, among others. Flavonoids
  are antiangiogenic through a variety of mechanisms; they inhibit VEGF expression,
  inhibit endothelial cell migration, and decrease matrix metalloproteinases MMP-2
  and MMP-9. The U.S. Department of Agriculture identifies spinach, onions, parsley,
  beets, and thyme among high flavonoid-containing vegetables and herbs. Fresh salad
  greens such as lettuce, chicory, arugula, and red lettuce are also rich in polyphenolic
  flavonoids.\n\nQuercetin is a flavonoid found in numerous types of fruits and vegetables.
  Its antiangiogenic properties include inhibition of MMP-2 and MMP-9 secretion from
  tumor cells and inhibition of endothelial cell proliferation and migration. For
  example, quercetin has been shown to reduce in vitro tube formation of VEGF-stimulated
  human umbilical vein endothelial cells  grown on a 3-dimensional matrix by as much
  as 40%. With regards to epidemiologic data, a large prospective study of 41,000
  women living in Iowa between the ages of 55 and 69 found a number of flavonoid-containing
  leafy greens, which are abundant in quercetin, was associated with a significant
  risk reduction for lung cancer. Women who reported eating more than six servings
  of leafy greens per week were nearly half as likely to develop lung cancer during
  the four-year follow-up period, when compared to women who ate the least greens.
  This benefit extended to both smokers and nonsmokers alike.  \nOne of the richest
  sources of dietary flavonoids is red onion, which has particularly high levels of
  quercetin. Case control studies from Italian and Swiss populations have shown that
  moderate  to high frequency  of onion consumption protects against a variety of
  cancer including colorectal, prostate, ovarian, and laryngeal cancers. For example,
  there was a nearly 73% risk reduction for ovarian cancer in the population when
  comparing those who frequently consumed onion  compared to those with less frequent
  consumption. Similarly, there was an 88% risk reduction for esophageal cancer in
  the group with highest versus lowest onion intake. In a separate Dutch cohort study,
  consumption of at least half an onion/day was associated with 50% risk reduction
  in gastric cancer. Finally, researchers using data from the large-scale EPIC study
  showed that high onion consumption was associated with a 21% risk reduction for
  ovarian cancer. \n\nAnthocyanins are pigments that are present in many types of
  berries and grapes as well as red wine. They exhibit a purple color at neutral pH,
  red in acidic, and blue in alkaline conditions. Anthocyanins are end-products of
  the flavonoid pathway, while anthocyanidins are their aglycone precursors. Their
  natural function may be to attract pollinators and animals to eat the fruit or plant
  and disperse their seeds.   \nThey have been shown to inhibit angiogenesis and tumor
  growth in experimental animals injected subcutaneously with N-nitrosomethylbenzylamine,
  an esophageal carcinogen. Rats that were fed an anthocyanin-rich freeze-fried extract
  \ obtained from black raspberries, blackberries, or strawberries showed a reduced
  number of esophageal tumors as compared to controls -41% less by BRB, 46% less by
  blackberries, and 24% less by strawberries. In another study of esophageal papillomas
  in rats, animals fed BRB had fewer papillomas that were of smaller volume, with
  reduced cell proliferation and suppression of VEGF and HIF-1alpha expression seen
  by immunohistochemistry as compared to the non-BRB treated mice. DNA microarray
  studies of rat esophageal carcinogenesis have shown that dietary black raspberries
  modulate the expression of genes associated with angiogenesis, including the cyclooxygenase
  and lipoxygenase pathways of arachadonic acid metabolism, as well as MMP-10 expression;
  CD34 staining as a marker for microvessel density was also found to be significantly
  reduced in the BRB diet animals. Berries are also rich in other natural polyphenols
  such as ellagic acid, which contributes to bioactivity.  \nAn extract from black
  raspberries has been studied in human subjects diagnosed clinically with oral intraepithelial
  neoplasia. BRB 10% was applied in a gel form to the oral mucosa four times daily.
  After 6 weeks, there was reduced histological grade of dysplastic lesions in 50%
  of treated subjects, and reduced levels of COX-2 and iNOS in the lesions.\n\nProanthocyanidins
  are a type of tannin--large polymeric chains of flavonoids--found in many plants
  and fruits, notably cacao, cinnamon, cranberry, apples, grapes, black current, chokeberry,
  and persimmon. Proanthocyanidins are thought to be the major source of flavonoids
  ingested in the Western diet. Historically tannins from wood bark were used as tanning
  agents to turn animal hide into leather due to their ability to precipitate proteins.
  They are also responsible for the astringent taste of certain foods and beverages.
  Among their natural roles is protection against predation. Anthocyanins and proanthocyanidins
  share steps in the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway. Specifically, proanthocyanidins
  are generated from the polymerization of flavonoid monomers, which are products
  of a branch pathway of anthocyanin biosynthesis.  \nProanthocyanidins constitute
  60% of the polyphenol content in cacao, the source of chocolate. It is in the yeast-based
  fermentation of the raw cacao bean where the characteristic flavor precursors develop
  and polyphenols complex into procyanidin polymers with a core structure of -epicatechin,
  similar to green tea. Pentameric and octameric procyanidins isolated from cacao
  beans have been shown to inhibit the growth of cultured human aortic endothelial
  cells and human dermal microvascular endothelial cells  following angiogenic stimulation
  with low-level H2O2. The cacao pentameric fraction downregulates the expression
  of ErbB2 tyrosine kinase. Cocoa powder extract inhibits TNF-alpha-induced VEGF secretion
  in vitro. When JB6 mouse epidermal cells were pretreated with a polyphenol-rich
  cocoa powder extract, then exposed to TNF-alpha, there was a dose-dependent inhibition
  of TNF-alpha-induced VEGF expression compared to untreated controls. At the highest
  but noncytotoxic concentration of cacao extract, VEGF expression was reduced more
  than twofold compared to controls.   \nThere is evidence that cacao consumption
  can affect human vasculature and health. After ingestion, cacao flavonoids are stable
  in the gastric environment and can be detected in human plasma. In studies of human
  volunteers, angiotensin-converting enzyme  activity is inhibited by 18% only three
  hours after a single intake of 75 grams of dark  chocolate. In a study of 4,849
  individuals in Italy, those who ate one 20 gram serving of dark chocolate every
  3 days had serum C-reactive protein  significantly lower than those who did not.
  Notably, the Kuna Indians living on the San Blas Island of Panama--who have a ten-fold
  higher dietary intake of cacao compared to Panamanian mainlanders--have lower blood
  pressure, live longer, and have lower incidence of cancer compared to mainlanders.
  Consistent with their cacao consumption, the Kuna have 6-times higher urinary excretion
  of cacao procyanidin metabolites than mainlanders.  \nProcyanidins are also found
  in cinnamon, which have been found to inhibit angiogenesis and tumor growth. Cinnamon
  extract inhibits VEGF receptor-2 on endothelial cells and suppresses endothelial
  cell proliferation, migration, and tube formation in vitro. A water-soluble extract
  from dried cinnamon bark, orally administered every day or every other day for 20
  days to mice bearing experimental melanomas suppresses melanoma growth. The cinnamon
  extract suppressed tumor microvessel density, and as shown by quantitative RT-PCR,
  the expression of angiogenic factors VEGF, FGF, and TGF-  as well as COX-2 and HIF-1alpha,
  which promote angiogenesis. In addition, the cinnamon extract suppresses melanoma
  metastasis as measured by the size and weight of the spleen and draining lymph nodes
  of mice bearing melanoma in vivo.  \nMany edible berries also contain proanthocyanidins,
  including the American cranberry, black currants, and grapes. Chokeberries, named
  because of their extreme astringency, contain among the highest levels of proanthocyanidins
  detected. Mixtures of berry extracts inhibit tube formation of endothelial cells
  in Matrigel. Extracts from blueberries, bilberries, raspberries, and strawberries
  suppress VEGF expression by immortalized human keratinocytes  in vitro and this
  VEGF inhibition appears to be independent of the antioxidant property of the extracts.
  Experimental liver cancer in rodents induced by the carcinogen DENA are suppressed
  in number and size by an extract from black currants added to the animals diet.
  Procyanidins in cranberries may have multiple health benefits including both chemopreventive
  properties as well as maintaining bladder health due to inhibiting E. Coli adherence
  to uroepithelium. A cranberry extract tested on DU145 human prostate cancer cells
  significantly inhibited expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 and increased expression of
  TIMP-2 in vitro, consistent with mechanisms that suppress angiogenesis. Cranberry
  juice, given as a 20% solution, reduces the incidence of azoxymethane-induced colonic
  aberrant crypts in rats by 77% versus drinking water controls when supplemented
  for three weeks before and ten weeks after carcinogen exposure.  \nBoth apples and
  apple juice are rich sources of procyanidins in addition to other polyphenols previously
  described such as quercetin and catechins. Based on the USDA Continuing Survey of
  Food Intakes by Individuals, apples are a major source of proanthocyanidins in the
  U.S. diet. In a recent study, scientists examined the specific chemopreventive properties
  of a polyphenol extract of apple juice. Apple procyanidins were found to inhibit
  Cox-1. Several studies have shown that cloudy apple juices, such as apple cider,
  contain much higher concentrations of procyanidins than clear apple juices. Specifically,
  one study determined that the suspended particles in cloudy apple juice contain
  up to 60% of apple procyanidins in the juice.  \nEpidemiological studies have provided
  accumulating evidence that apples have cancer-preventive properties, particularly
  against lung and colorectal cancers. In the Nurses Health Study involving 77,000
  women, a statistically significant 37% risk reduction for lung cancer was observed
  among women for increases of 1 serving per day of apples or pears. Similar results
  were obtained from a Finnish cohort study involving 10,000 men and women. The results
  of a case-control study conducted in Hawaii with 528 lung cancer cases and 528 controls
  found a statistically significant decrease in lung cancer risk with increased consumption
  of apples. An analysis of case-control studies conducted in Italy found that people
  who consumed at least one apple per day had a significantly reduced risk of colorectal
  cancer and cancers of the oral cavity, larynx, breast, and ovary relative to those
  who ate less than an apple a day. In a prospective cohort of 35,159 Iowa women aged
  55-69 years, intake of apple juice or cider was associated with lower risk of developing
  non-Hodgkins lymphoma.\n\nEllagitannins are glycosides of the flavonoid ellagic
  acid and fall under the category of hydrolyzable tannins. They can be found in numerous
  types of fruits and nuts including pomegranate, strawberries, blackberries, raspberries,
  muscadine grapes, walnuts, and pecans. Upon consumption, ellagitannins are hydrolyzed
  to ellagic acid which is antiangiogenic. Colonic microbiota further convert ellagic
  acid to urolithin A which is also bioactive.  \nAll parts of the pomegranate contain
  high levels of ellagitannins, of which the primary type is punicalagin. Bioactive
  polyphenols are found not only in the edible aril  which is popularly consumed,
  but also concentrated in the peel of the fruit, which is not usually consumed but
  may be part of the juice extraction by some processors. Indeed, polyphenol extraction
  increases 6.5-fold when the whole fruit is processed compared to juice from arils
  alone. Ellagitannins have been shown to inhibit the growth of prostate cancer in
  both in vitro and in vivo laboratory experiments, and studies have suggested that
  the compounds antiangiogenic properties play a role in this inhibition. Interestingly,
  pure pomegranate juice has been found to be more potent than its separated individual
  polyphenol components, likely due to synergistic effects. Effects of pomegranate
  extract --derived from the skin and seeds of the pomegranate fruit--have been shown
  on endothelial cells  and human prostate cancer cells  in vitro. Pomegranate extract
  inhibited the proliferation of both cell types and suppressed the secretion of VEGF
  and HIF-1alpha. Mice implanted with human prostate tumors derived from the LAPC4
  tumor line were administered the human equivalent of 1.7 cups  of pomegranate juice
  per day. Pomegranate juice significantly decreased tumor microvessel density, as
  well as tumor size, compared to the control animals. Pomegranate juice, when given
  as a 20% solution, reduces the incidence of azoxymethane-induced colonic aberrant
  crypts in rats. In a study of men with recurrent prostate cancer who drank 1 cup
  of pomegranate juice per day, their prostate-specific antigen  doubling time was
  extended from 15 to 54 months.\n\nA form of vitamin K, menaquinone, found in certain
  food sources is antiangiogenic and associated with a reduced risk for developing
  several forms of cancer. Menaquinone is distinct from the phylloquinone  present
  in dark leafy vegetables. Instead, menaquinone is a fat--soluble vitamin formed
  naturally by bacteria in fermented dairy products, including cheese and yogurt,
  in fermented soy such as natto, and also present in dark meat. Certain cheeses,
  such as Dutch Gouda, Swiss Emmental, and Norwegian Jarlsberg, have particularly
  high concentrations of menaquinone. In laboratory studies, menaquinones suppress
  angiogenesis, enhance tumor apoptosis, and inhibit the proliferation of cancer cells.\n\nA
  subpopulation of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition
  \ study, called the Heidelberg cohort, followed the diet and health status of more
  than 24,300 participants for at least ten years, starting in 1994. The participants
  answered detailed questionnaires at regular intervals about their diet and general
  health. During the follow-up period, 1,775 cancer cases were diagnosed, of which
  458 were fatal. Among the foods documented, participants who consumed the most cheese
  \ had a significantly reduced risk of dying from cancer compared with those who
  consumed the least. Cheese consumption contributed to about 45% of total menaquinone
  intake. In terms of specific cancers, higher consumption food containing menaquinone
  was associated with significantly lower incidences of lung cancer and prostate cancer.
  Participants with the highest levels of menaquinone in their diets had a 62% reduced
  risk of lung cancer compared with those with the least, and a similar reduced risk
  of dying from lung cancer. \n\nProspective clinical studies of vitamin K2 have shown
  chemopreventive activity in patients. In a study of 40 women in Osaka diagnosed
  with viral liver cirrhosis, individuals were assigned randomly to an intervention
  or control group. During more than 7 years of followup, the cumulative proportion
  of people who developed hepatocellular carcinoma  was significantly smaller in the
  group that received vitamin K2. Vitamin K2 decreased the risk of HCC to 20% compared
  to that of the control group. On an annual incidence basis, HCC developed in only
  1.6% in the treatment group compared with 8.8% in the control group and 7.9% in
  the general cirrhotic population.\n\nCurcumin, a flavonoid derived from the plant
  Curcuma longa, is present in tumeric spice. It has chemopreventive and antiangiogenic
  activity and inhibits carcinogenesis in skin, stomach, intestines, and liver. Dietary
  ingestion of curcumin has been shown to prevent the formation of colon polyps, suppress
  proliferation of colon cancer and prostate cancer cells, and decrease intratumoral
  microvessel density. Studies of endothelial cells exposed in vitro to curcumin show
  induction of apoptosis; downregulation of gene transcripts for VEGF, bFGF, and MMP-2;
  COX-2 inhibition; upregulation of TIMP; disruption of vascular tube formation; and
  inhibition of endothelial cell motility by interfering with the Ras-mediated c-Jun
  N-terminal kinase  pathway. \n\nA Phase I prevention trial of curcumin  showed histological
  improvement of lesions in patients with various malignant and premalignant lesions,
  including recently resected bladder cancer, oral leukoplakia, intestinal metaplasia,
  CIN, and Bowens disease. In a Phase II study, dietary curcumin was given for 30
  days to 44 subjects with aberrant crypt foci, a premalignant marker for colorectal
  cancer. Those who consumed 4 g/day of curcumin had a 40% reduction in the number
  of rectal ACF lesions. \n\nBeta-cryptoxanthin is a natural carotenoid pigment present
  in brightly colored orange, red, or yellow foods. Structurally it is related to
  beta-carotene, and is ultimately metabolized to vitamin A in the body and can be
  found circulating in the blood after consuming carotenoid-rich foods. Vitamin A
  and retinoic acid analogs are antiangiogenic and synthetic derivatives have been
  investigated as chemopreventive agents. \n\nPapaya is a rich source of carotenoids,
  with the same lycopene content as tomatoes, but twice the beta-cryptoxanthin content.
  Studies in tropical populations have shown that increased daily consumption of papayas
  results in higher levels of beta-cryptoxanthin in the blood. Consumption of such
  beta-cryptoxanthin-rich foods may reduce cancer rates in high-risk populations.
  For example, higher papaya consumption has been shown to be inversely associated
  with the risk of developing high-grade cervical lesions. A nested case control study
  involving a population of HPV-positive women in Brazil showed that consuming one
  or more servings of papaya per week cut the risk of developing a high grade cervical
  lesion by 81%.\n\nOther studies have shown a risk reduction with the consumption
  of papaya and carotenoid-rich fruits for other cancers, including lung and gall
  bladder cancers. In the Singapore Chinese Health Study, 63,257 Chinese men and women
  ages 45-74 participated in a prospective study of diet and cancer. Using a food
  composition database, an estimate of their carotenoid intake, including beta-cryptoxanthin
  was quantified. In the first 8 years of follow-up, 482 lung cancer cases occurred
  in the cohort. A high level of dietary beta-cryptoxanthin was associated with reduced
  risk of lung cancer. Comparing the highest to lowest quartile, there was a 27% risk
  reduction among all subjects, and a 37% risk reduction among current smokers.\n\nIn
  a study of women, diet, and breast cancer risk, 403 breast cancer cases and 602
  controls from the Nurses Health Study were examined for high breast densities, a
  strong predictor for breast cancer risk. Overall, circulating total carotenoids
  were inversely associated with breast cancer risk. Among women in the highest tertile
  of mammographic density, total carotenoids were associated with a 50% reduction
  in breast cancer risk. \n\nWe have identified antiangiogenic activity in a number
  of other dietary-derived chemopreventive molecules. These include brassinin, a phytoalexin
  found in Chinese cabbage; the citrus-derived bioflavonoids hesperidin and naringenin;
  ellagic acid from berries, pomegranate, and grapes; silymarin from milk thistle
  and artichoke; and the organosulfur allyl disulfide derived from garlic. Further
  studies are underway to define their molecular targets in angiogenesis, their optimal
  biological doses, and efficacy in inhibiting tumor vascularity.\n\nThe diverse natural
  sources of these and other antiangiogenic chemopreventive molecules raise the possibility
  of designing scientific diets for patients at high risk for cancer, or for those
  with known disease to chronically suppress angiogenesis and tumorigenesis.\n\nAngiogenesis
  is a critical, rate-limiting step in the development of all known cancers, and its
  inhibition suppresses tumor growth, progression, and metastases. Antiangiogenic
  therapy represents a new approach to the early intervention and prevention of malignant
  disease. During the next two decades, the total yearly number of newly diagnosed
  cases of cancer is projected to rise from 12.4 million new cases per year in 2008
  to 26.4 million in 2030, and the number of annual deaths is projected to increase
  170%, to 17 million. According to the World Health Organization and International
  Agency for Research on Cancer, cancer is the leading cause of death worldwide as
  of 2010. The implementation of effective chemoprevention strategies based on angiogenesis
  inhibition attained through dietary sources may decrease these numbers in a cost-effective
  and quality of life enhancing manner. Dietary effects are already thought to underlie
  many of the large international differences in incidence seen for most cancers.
  Indeed, nutritional factors have been estimated to contribute to 20-60% of cancers
  worldwide and to approximately one-third of deaths from cancer in Western countries.
  \n\nThe identification of dietary sources of antiangiogenic molecules has been aided
  tremendously through observational epidemiologic studies, which have the ability
  to identify specific foods associated with reduced cancer risk. These studies generally
  fall under the categories of prospective cohort and retrospective case-control studies,
  and more of both of these types of studies will be necessary to identify additional
  sources of antiangiogenic compounds and to help confirm the chemopreventive properties
  of previously identified foods and their constituent bioactive molecules. \n\nThe
  dietary prospective cohort study allows thorough assessment of dietary exposures
  with a reduced risk of recall bias as patients are initially cancer-free when enrolled.
  As study participants are followed into the future and observed for the development
  of cancer and other cancer-related endpoints, investigators can identify specific
  foods present in participants diets that are associated with cancer risk reduction.
  With the evolving understanding of the underlying molecular basis of various naturally
  antiangiogenic foods, an important consideration for future cancer prevention cohort
  studies will be to ensure accurate assessment of participants dietary intake of
  bioactive compounds. This will include not only comprehensively querying participants
  about all potential dietary sources of the bioactive compounds of interest, but
  also obtaining more detailed information about the preparation of foods, as this
  can significantly impact the amount of antiangiogenic molecules obtained through
  diet. Furthermore, the subtypes of foods consumed, such as the specific variety
  of apple or tomato eaten by a participant, and the way the food is processed or
  cooked prior to consumption, can strongly affect the amount of consumed bioactive
  molecules and would be important information to collect. Thus, while the food frequency
  questionnaires  used in past cohort studies have attempted to quantify the intake
  of various foods, future studies focused on antiangiogenesis may be able to make
  a more detailed and accurate assessment of this particular aspect of dietary intake.
  \n\nCase-control studies can also be valuable as a method for expediently identifying
  promising dietary exposures without the need for the long timeframes and massive
  study populations that typically characterize dietary cohort studies. While case-control
  studies are nearly always vulnerable to recall bias on the part of the cancer patients
  who compose the case populations, they are a valuable starting point in identifying
  promising risk-reducing foods that can be further explored through prospective and,
  more recently, interventional dietary studies. The key to these studies will be
  the use of well-designed dietary survey instruments and methods to allow data capture
  on short time horizons that can accurately gauge the intake of antiangiogenic and
  chemopreventive biomolecules. Finally, interventional dietary studies are a particularly
  promising methodology with which to confirm the antiangiogenic and chemopreventive
  properties of specific foods and bioactive molecules. In particular, recently diagnosed
  cancer patients or those with pre-invasive angiogenesis-dependent lesions such as
  colonic adenomas, prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, cervical intraepithelial
  neoplasia, and actinic keratoses could potentially show significant benefit from
  short-term antiangiogenic dietary interventions with regards to progression, metastasis,
  or recurrence of their lesions. Investigators with access to serum or biopsy samples
  could also follow changes to angiogenesis biomarkers, tumor biomarkers, or tumor
  characteristics. Because of their experimental nature, randomized interventional
  dietary studies have the potential to become a valuable method for validating the
  antiangiogenic nature of bioactive molecules and foods. \n\nThe United States Department
  of Agricultures update to its longstanding Food Pyramid dietary recommendations--namely,
  its replacement with the new MyPlate initiative that pushes for an increase in the
  amount of whole fruits and vegetables consumed at each meal--does appear to indirectly
  promote increased consumption of certain foods that contain natural sources of antiangiogenic
  molecules. For example, specific recommendations of the initiative include glucosinolate-rich
  cruciferous vegetables, lycopene-containing tomatoes, resveratrol-bearing grape
  products, and beta-cryptoxanthin-abundant orange and yellow vegetables.\n\nData
  and conclusions from rigorous dietary cancer prevention studies should be implemented
  into public health policy. Optimal health outcomes result not just from high quality
  medical care, but also from diet and lifestyle patterns that can intercept disease
  at the earliest microscopic stages. Investments in cancer prevention, guided by
  the biological principles of antiangiogenic therapy, will expand on the substantial
  clinical applications already established by the biopharmaceutical industry. Cancer
  prevention using antiangiogenic factors present in widely available foods further
  offers an egalitarian strategy for large populations in societies that increasingly
  recognize the value of health-promoting dietary choices. Many dietary sources of
  angiogenesis inhibitors are common ingredients in the worlds most popular culinary
  traditions. We propose that an antiangiogenic diet is a practical and cost-effective
  method to reduce the risk of cancer and other diseases and to enhance quality of
  life.\n\nIn summary, tumor angiogenesis is a critical target for cancer prevention.
  Natural antiangiogenic molecules are present in numerous dietary sources and represent
  a wide spectrum of mechanisms that can suppress the growth of microscopic tumors.
  The control of blood vessel growth through dietary antiangiogenesis promises to
  redefine cancer as a disease that can be suppressed throughout an individuals lifetime,
  from infancy through adulthood.\n\nThe author would like to thank Erwin Kruger,
  Justin Leahey, and Joy Li for their assistance in research, data compilation, codification,
  and analysis.\n"
