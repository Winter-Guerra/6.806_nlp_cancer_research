  Tartary buckwheat was subjected to hydrothermal treatments for minimising rutin
  loss in buckwheat-based foods by water addition. When native buckwheat flour was
  mixed with water for 60 min, the rutin content was distinctly reduced from 3.74
  g/100 g to 0.31 g/100 g, increasing the amount of quercetin. However, the rutin
  content remained constant and quercetin was hardly detected in hydrothermally-treated
  buckwheat flour. Also, when noodles were prepared with wheat and buckwheat flours,
  the noodle samples containing hydrothermally-treated buckwheat flour, showed higher
  amounts of rutin  than the control noodle with native buckwheat flour. In addition,
  the use of hydrothermally-treated buckwheat flour gave less pasting parameters and
  lower viscoelastic properties. The noodle dough with hydrothermally-treated buckwheat
  flour also had greater water absorption and development time during mixing while
  the elongation stress of the noodle dough was reduced.'
