text: '


  Resveratrol and pterostilbene exhibit numerous biological effects, including antiproliferative
  and proapoptotic activities, in various experimental settings. Mammalian Mediator
  subunit MED28 is highly expressed in several types of tumor including breast cancer.
  Recently, we have reported that MED28 regulates cellular migration and invasion
  in human breast cancer cells, whereas resveratrol can inhibit the effect. In the
  current study we investigated the effect of resveratrol and pterostilbene on MED28
  expression and cell growth in human breast cancer cells. MED28 suppression delayed
  cell cycle progression, and reduced the expression of cyclin D1 and p-RelA/p65 as
  well as the transcriptional activity of NFB, but increased the levels of p27 and
  FOXO3a. Overexpression of MED28 enhanced S phase entry and increased p-p65 expression.
  Resveratrol and pterostilbene reduced the expression of MED28 and cyclin D1, and
  mediated the transcriptional activity of NFB, thereby suppressing the growth-promoting
  role of MED28.'
