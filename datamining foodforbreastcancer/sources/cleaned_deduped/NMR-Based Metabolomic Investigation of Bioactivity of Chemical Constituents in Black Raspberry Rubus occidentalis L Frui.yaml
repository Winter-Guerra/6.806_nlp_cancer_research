  Metabolomic Investigation of Bioactivity of Chemical Constituents in Black Raspberry

text: "\n\nBlack raspberry   fruit extracts with differing compound profiles have
  shown variable antiproliferative activities against HT-29 colon cancer cell lines.
  This study used partial least-squares  regression analysis to develop a high-resolution
  1H NMR-based multivariate statistical model for discerning the biological activity
  of BR constituents. This model identified specific bioactive compounds and ascertained
  their relative contribution against cancer cell proliferation. Cyanidin 3-rutinoside
  and cyanidin 3-xylosylrutinoside were the predominant contributors to the extract
  bioactivity, but salicylic acid derivatives, quercetin 3-glucoside, quercetin 3-rutinoside,
  p-coumaric acid, epicatechin, methyl ellagic acid derivatives, and citric acid derivatives
  also contributed significantly to the antiproliferative activity of the berry extracts.
  This approach enabled the identification of new bioactive components in BR fruits
  and demonstrates the utility of the method for assessing chemopreventive compounds
  in foods and food products.\n\nNMR; black raspberries; Rubus occidentalis L.; cancer;

  foods include well-known antioxidants that function on several metabolic levels
  to reduce oxidative stress and to regulate signal transduction pathways, transcription
  factor function, gene expression, enzyme activity, and other cellular and subcellular
  processes that moderate inflammatory responses associated with the onset and development
  of chronic diseases. To accomplish their roles, these bioactive compounds likely
  act in concert rather than independently. Moreover, even simple fruit extracts may
  contain hundreds of secondary plant compounds from several compound classes, of
  which a select few may interact to induce a therapeutic response. Therefore, using
  metabolomics or metabolomics-based approaches involving partial least-squares  regression
  analysis and/or other statistical procedures to identify specific bioactive phytonutrients
  and to define their role in moderating disease may have significant advantages over
  more traditional investigative techniques by which compound bioactivities are investigated
  sequentially.\n\nClinical research with animal/human models and subjects provides
  compelling evidence that black raspberries  contain bioactive compounds that have
  complex chemopreventive properties with regard to aerodigestive  cancers and other
  cancers. Although these classical studies have identified several important chemopreventive
  constituents of BR derivatives including anthocyanins and nonanthocyanin phenols
  such as ellagic acid, ferulic acid, gallic acid, p-coumaric acid, flavonols, and
  their derivatives, the total impact of the treatments could not be accounted for
  by any single compound or single group of constituents. Therefore, the body of evidence
  confirming the potential efficacy of BR-based clinical treatments and the current
  level of knowledge about their apparent bioactive constituents offered a unique
  opportunity to develop analytical model systems that delineate plant constituenttherapeutic
  response relationships.\n\nTo meet this challenge, we developed a model system that
  compares the 1H NMR spectra of relatively crude BR extracts with the cellular proliferation
  of HT-29 human colon cancer cells.\n\nOur approach to modeling linked variable bioassay
  results to variation in plant sample extract secondary metabolite complements and
  employed multivariate statistical analyses to identify specific regions of the extract
  NMR spectra that were associated with the array of biological responses. Once spectral
  regions responsible for these relationships were identified by the model, compound
  structures were verified using 2D NMR methods, such as heteronuclear single-quantum
  coherence  and heteronuclear multiple-bond correlation  experiments.\n\nTo validate
  this approach, we first ensured that BR extract profile variability could be achieved
  by capitalizing upon the genetic and environmental influences on fruit composition.
  In addition, we verified that specific signals within complex NMR profiles responsible
  for known chemical relationships could be identified through multivariate statistical
  analyses. Specifically, we regressed BR extract NMR profiles against standard biochemical
  analyses. This verification model successfully recognized the specific protons within
  the NMR spectra associated with anthocyanins that played significant roles in the
  activity of extracts in these assays. Furthermore, the model found structureactivity
  relationships to be statistically identifiable.\n\nHere we have applied our system
  to model the biological relationship between bioactive compound variability among
  73 BR extracts and their ability to inhibit HT-29 colon cancer cell proliferation.
  We previously reported the effects of these extracts on cancer cell cultures in
  this study. The variable BR juice extracts inhibited HT-29 colon cancer cell growth
  broadly from 33 to 118% when included in the culture media at low and high doses
  of 0.6 or 1.2 mg extract/mL, respectively. Cell responses were dose-dependent, and
  the response arrays between doses were highly correlated. Although anthocyanins
  are known to contribute substantially to BRs chemoprotective properties, extract
  anthocyanin concentrations as measured by TMA were not correlated to levels of growth
  inhibition, suggesting that nonanthocyanin components also contribute to BR extract
  bioactivity in the HT-29 colon cancer cell assay. Recently, we identified a cadre
  of nonanthocyanins present in our extracts, some of which had yet to be reported
  as BR constituents.\n\nIn this paper, we present the description of anthocyanin
  as well as nonanthocyanin compounds identified by our modeling system that are responsible
  for the antiproliferative properties of BR extracts within the HT-29 colon cancer
  cell bioassay. Our model also indicates that compounds of various classes present
  in extracts over a broad concentration range may act together to affect cancer cell
  growth.\n\nMarketable BR fruit samples of three cultivars  varying in ripeness  from
  seven Ohio commercial farms were obtained for this study. Fruit were hand-harvested
  in fiber-board containers and transported on ice to the Ohio Agricultural Research
  and Development Center. Sample extracts from 75 samples for both NMR and cell assay
  procedures were prepared as described by Johnson and coauthors. This process included
  the following steps: sample handling, over-ripening fruit, sample storage, preparation
  of BR juices, isolation of secondary product constituent-rich methanolic extracts
  via solid phase extraction, evaporation of solvents under an N2 stream, and freeze-drying
  of solvent-free SPE column eluates.\n\nAll NMR studies of BR extract samples were
  performed with a Varian INOVA 750 MHz NMR spectrometer  using a Varian triple-resonance
  1H{13C/15N} pulsed field gradient cryoprobe. Solid materials derived from the column
  eluate were diluted with appropriate amounts of methanol-d4/trifluoroacetic acid-d
  \ and 5 mM 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate sodium salt  in methanol-d4 to
  give 800 L aliquots that contained 20 mg of dried berry extract and 0.5 mM DSS.
  The samples were filtered through glass wool and placed in 5 mm NMR tubes. All samples
  were stored at 4 C prior to analysis. Two of the 75 samples were prepared incorrectly
  for NMR analysis and were excluded from further examination.\n\nThe spectra were
  collected at 25 C over a spectral width of 9023 Hz using a 6.2 s  pulse. The acquisition
  time was 2.7 s, and 128 transients were accumulated with presaturation of the HDO
  resonance in the 4.915.07 ppm region. Data were processed with 0.5 Hz exponential
  line broadening and zero filled to 131,072 points before Fourier transformation.\n\n1H
  NMR free induction decays  were processed as a batch, using KnowItAll Metabolomics
  software 8.1  with a Lorentzian apodization of 0.3 Hz, baseline correction with
  automatic base point detection, and spline fitting. The DSS reference peak was manually
  set to 0 ppm for each spectrum. After the region containing solvent  resonances
  \ had been flat-lined, each spectrum was normalized against the DSS peak. Alignment
  macros were applied as a batch process to numerous specific locations along the
  spectrum to compensate for peak shifting due to variation in pH and in the constituent
  concentrations among samples. Prior to statistical analysis, binning/bucketing was
  conducted from 0.550 to 9.200 ppm using the Bio-Rad IntelliBucket method, where
  the bin width was automatically adjusted on the basis of the overlap density heatmap
  \ consensus spectrum and a bin width setting of 0.004  0.002 ppm. Regions that were
  excluded from binning were as follows:  4.9105.070 ppm ;  3.2573.373 ppm ;  highly
  overlapping peaks  of the saccharide region; and  regions throughout the spectrum
  of low signal/noise. However, all regions containing resonances for anomeric protons
  were included in the binning process. This resulted in a data set of 1003 bins from
  each of 73 BR extract samples that was further reduced to 464 bins by selecting
  bins with intensities above the analytically justified limit of quantitation.\n\nThe
  PLS regression-based predictive model building using Pirouette 4.0  started with
  the 464 bin data sets. Peak intensities of bins for each of the 73 BR samples were
  regressed against the bioassay responses as shown in Table S1 in the Supporting
  Information. A maximum number of 15 factors and a probability threshold of 0.95
  were set. Two-component orthogonal signal correction  was used to remove components
  in our large X block that were orthogonal to the Y block, thus segregating the portion
  of the X block that was correlated. To aid the interpretation of chemical information
  from the regression models, one subset of relevant variables  was selected from
  the entire block of X-variables. The criteria for variable selection were software-dependent
  measures of fit. The regression vector values from this subset of bins were then
  ranked from highest to lowest for the low- and high-dose bioassays, respectively.\n\nClassical
  biochemical studies of chemoprevention and cancer cell antiproliferation, in response
  to berry fruits and BR in particular, are challenging because several berry fractions
  and many specific secondary products have been shown to have some effect on the
  cancer cell performance, but no single fraction or compound can account for the
  efficacy of whole fruit or crude fruit extracts. Our approach uses omics and bioinformatic
  procedures to identify active components by NMR spectroscopy and to link them to
  their impact on cell proliferation in HT-29 colon cancer cells in a manner similar
  to that described by Leiss et al. and Gavaghan et al. to determine important effectors
  of host-plant resistance and maize salt stress, respectively. Because many BR secondary
  compounds have been shown to have roles in BR regulation of cancer cell development,
  there exists a large body of data for the potential verification of the compounds
  identified by the model.\n\nModeling of secondary product chemistry, in conjunction
  with medical efficacy, provides an opportunity to examine complex mixtures of secondary
  products that are present in plant materials and determine how they affect cell
  health, chemoprevention, and/or cancer cell proliferation. NMR is a powerful method
  used to elucidate chemical structures of molecules; here we have used it to identify
  components of complex mixtures of small molecule metabolites simultaneously, at
  a high resolution. Moreover, samples were readily prepared in a reproducible manner
  without the need for additional separation techniques. Processing the data with
  KnowItAll statistical software permitted the BR components that play significant
  roles in the control of HT-29 cell proliferation to be identified.\n\nOur model
  generated large blocks of data concerning the chemical nature of the extracts, which
  were evaluated against a complex series of chemical reactions that we monitored
  as cell proliferation. The impact of these secondary compounds on cell proliferation
  represents the sum of all of the reactions controlling cell growth, metabolism,
  and apoptosis that have been demonstrated by a host of research.\n\nModel development
  was initiated by obtaining the 1H NMR spectra of the 73 BR extracts. The spectra
  of three representative BR extract samples are shown in Figure 1. In all 1H spectra
  of BR extract samples, the HDO resonance from water that had been observed in the
  4.915.07 ppm region was suppressed using a presaturation pulse sequence. The singlet
  peak at 0.0 ppm is from DSS, which was added as an internal standard for chemical
  shift measurement as well as a calibration standard for quantitation. The strong
  peaks centered at 3.31 ppm, 3.35 ppm, and 3.97 ppm  are attributed to the resonances
  of residual CHD2OD from methanol-d4, a solvent-like impurity, and an artifact compound,
  respectively. The resonances in the complex region, 4.003.22 ppm, are attributed
  to nonanomeric resonances from the saccharides that are attached to the phenolic
  structures. The suppression of these signals and the regions of low signal-to-noise
  ratios  in the initial data sets were made to ensure a robust analysis.\n\nFigure

  \ sample BR-28 from slightly over-ripe berries. Resonances from anthocyanins are
  indicated in purple and those from nonanthocyanins are indicated in green bars above
  the chemical shift scale.\n\nThe spectra of BR extract samples are dominated by
  the resonances from cyanidin 3-glycosides  as well as defining peaks for cyanidin
  3-rutinoside, cyanidin 3-xylosylrutinoside, cyanidin 3-glucoside, and cyanidin 3-sambubioside,
  the major phenolic antioxidants of BR fruits. The unique resonances from the minor
  anthocyanin, pelargonidin 3-rutinoside, are also detected. In Figure 1, the resonances
  from these anthocyanin phenolics are indicated in purple bars above the chemical
  shift scale.\n\nFigure 2. Structures of the cyanidin aglycone and four major anthocyanin
  phenolic compounds of black raspberry. 1, cyanidin aglycone ; 2, cyanidin 3-rutinoside
  ; 3, cyanidin 3-xylosylrutinoside ; 4, cyanidin 3-glucoside ; and 5, cyanidin 3-sambubioside.\n\nSeveral
  resonances from nonanthocyanin metabolites and the aliphatic moieties associated
  with citric acid derivatives  were also observed. The structures of nonanthocyanin
  phenolics, which were readily detected in the 1H NMR spectra of BR extracts, are
  shown in Figure 3. Compounds based on the quercetin moiety  included quercetin 3-glucoside
  \ and quercetin 3-rutinoside. Compound 11, salicylic acid glucosyl ester, where
  the glucose moiety is attached to a salicylic acid, was also evident. Additional
  nonanthocyanin compounds that have been detected in the 1H NMR spectra of BR extract
  samples are epicatechin, benzoic acid -d-glucopyranosyl ester, a salicylic acid
  derivative, p-coumaric acid, and methyl ellagic acid acetylpentose.\n\nFigure 3.

  ester of benzoic acid ; 14, salicylic acid derivative ; 15, p-coumaric acid; and
  16, methyl ellagic acid acetylpentose.\n\nAlthough these minor metabolites are present
  at concentrations approximately 102103 times the concentrations of the cyanidin
  3-glycosides, some of their proton resonances are clearly visible in the 1H NMR
  spectra of the BR extracts. For example, the H-8 and H-6 resonances from the quercetin
  glycosides, namely, Q 3-rut and Q 3-glc, are seen at 6.39 and 6.20 ppm, respectively.
  Likewise, for SAGE, one of the readily detected resonances is H-1, the anomeric
  proton resonance from the glucose attached to the phenolic structure via an ester
  linkage.\n\nOur model simultaneously analyzed a number of regions of the 1D 1H NMR
  spectra to ensure that participating components of the BR could be identified. This
  approach was demanding, because several proton resonances can be associated with
  one compound and intensities may differ depending on the number of protons in the
  compound structural unit. In addition, similarities in structures  can result in
  overlapping peaks yielding complex spectral patterns. To verify structures, especially
  for compounds present at low concentrations, additional NMR experiments such as
  1D selective total correlation spectroscopy, TOCSY, and 2D-NMR  were conducted.
  Furthermore, during the statistical analysis, the NMR data were subjected to Pareto
  scaling, where the square root of the standard deviation was used as a scaling factor.
  This minimized the effect of larger intensities in the presence of much smaller
  intensities.\n\nTo make regression modeling possible, we needed large amounts of
  variation in the extracts with a corresponding amount of variability in the cancer
  cell responses. This methodology differs from traditional medicinal chemistry approaches
  in which consistency in treatments is essential to understanding experimental outcomes.
  To verify the variability among our samples, the concentrations  of cyanidin structures
  were obtained for all 73 spectra on the basis of the manual integration of the H-4
  resonances using Bio-Rads ProcessIt NMR application. Normalized peak areas were
  obtained relative to the integration of the CH3 peak of DSS calibration standard
  at 0.0 ppm set to 100. These data revealed that the concentrations of the anthocyanin
  components in the 73 BR extract samples exhibited the desired high level of variability
  needed for our modeling efforts. In this study, Cy 3-xylrut was the most abundant
  phenolic component of the berry extracts, and the second most abundant component
  was Cy 3-rut. In general, the amounts of Cy 3-xylrut and Cy 3-rut were higher in
  ripe samples than in the under-ripe samples, whereas the amounts of Cy 3-glc and
  Cy 3-sam  both decrease with increasing ripeness.\n\nInitially, a model of the low-dose
  assay was generated with a data set of 464 bins determined using Pareto scaling
  and leave-one-out cross-validation. NMR bins were ranked according to their regression
  vector values. Subsets of the highest ranked bins were then created and modeled
  against the low-dose bioassay to determine the best fit of the NMR spectra to the
  extract impact on cell proliferation. Figure 4a shows a plot of PRESS as well as
  r values against model sets with various numbers of X-variables. Figure 4b shows
  the corresponding line plot between model factors and number of bins. The arrows
  A4 and A5 represent the regions of minimum PRESS and maximum r, respectively. Because
  the maximum number of bins does not exceed 2 times the number of samples, the minimum
  value of PRESS, maximum value of r, and minimum number of model factors are the
  quality indices of a good model. A compromise among these quality indices indicated
  that the optimum number of bins for the low-dose bioassay was 125. The indicators
  of the fit for this five-factor model are shown in Table 1. This model has r and
  slope values approaching 1 and values of the standard error of cross-validation
  \ and PRESS that approached their minima. In addition, Figure 5a shows the goodness
  of the Y-fit between predicted and measured values. The random distribution of the
  residuals  also indicates that the assumption of linearity between the X\\- and
  Y-variables is warranted.\n\nFigure 4. Partial least-squares  plots for the selection
  of X-variables :  number of factors;  indicators of fit. Arrow A1 represents the
  regions of minimum prediction residual error sum of squares  values, and arrow A2
  represents the regions of maximum r values. The vertical arrow indicated by A5 represents
  the subset of optimum of X-variables and its PLS-derived low-dose model factors.\n\nFigure
  5. Y-fits and residual plots for the models produced with low-dose  and high-dose
  \ bioassays.\n\nTable 1. Pirouette PLS-Derived Summary of Fit Measurements for the
  Low- and High-Dose Bioassay Activity of BRs  \n\nData are taken from the best PLS
  model with 125 highest ranked X-variables  from the first test model.\n\nData are
  taken from the best PLS model with 100 highest ranked X-variables  from the first
  test model.\n\nWhen the top 125 bins of this model were ranked according to their
  regression vector values, the contribution of specific compounds became evident.
  Because regression vectors are the weighted sum of loadings included in the model,
  they reveal the importance of each independent variable. These predictor variables
  are the basis for interpreting the effect of NMR bins, which carry the information
  about the chemical components, on the dependent variable, percent inhibition of
  cell proliferation. For the low-dose bioassay, Table 2 shows some of these compounds
  by their defining atom assignments and their rank/bin number, with corresponding
  atomic assignments being illustrated in Figures 2 and 3. The complete table of all
  125 bin assignments can be found in Table S3 in the Supporting Information. In Table
  2, specific bins corresponding to each of the four major anthocyanins in BR are
  shown to be important with Cy 3-xylrut and Cy 3-rut as the top-ranked. Cy 3-sam
  and Cy 3-glc also have an impact on bioassay results. A large number of bins were
  attributed to resonances of these cyanidin glycosides.\n\nTable 2. Pirouette PLS
  Model Developed with the Top 125 Bins Showing Bin Assignments, Chemical Shifts,
  and Rankings Based on Regression Vector Values for the Assessment of Low-Dose Bioassay
  Activity of Black Raspberry Extracts  \n\nBins corresponding to nonanthocyanin compounds
  were also shown to augment inhibition of cell proliferation in the HT29 low-dose
  bioassay. BR anthocyanins and nonanthocyanin phenolic compounds share some similarities
  in structure ; therefore, their 1H NMR spectra  would be expected to contain some
  overlapping resonances. Although this overlap confounded compound identification,
  defining bins were found to be important for MEAAP, epicatechin, Q 3-rut, Q 3-glc,
  p-coumaric acid, SAGE, a salicylic acid derivative, BAGE, and citric acid derivatives.\n\nWhen
  a model was calculated for the high-dose bioassay, similar but not identical results
  were obtained. This model was optimized at 100 bins, and indicators of fit are shown
  in Table 1 and Figure 5c,d. When the 100 bins were ranked according to their regression
  vector values, a trend similar to the low-dose results was evident. The highest
  ranked bin corresponded to Cy 3-xylrut and a defining bin for Cy 3-rut was ranked
  11th. Bins consistent with Cy 3-sam and Cy 3-glc were also evident as well as a
  large number of bins that corresponded to resonances of cyanidin glycosides. The
  same nonanthocyanin compounds that affected the low-dose model were also evident.
  However, the rankings of these compounds, especially a citric acid derivative, differed
  from those in the low-dose model. In general, many of the nonanthocyanin constituents
  appeared to gain in predictive value in the high-dose model.\n\nTable 3. Pirouette
  PLS Model Developed with Top 100 Bins Showing Bin Assignments, Chemical Shifts,
  and Rankings Based on Regression Vector Values for the Assessment of High-Dose Bioassay
  Activity of Black Raspberry Extracts  \n\nOverall, the importance of the nonanthocyanins
  was evident. As shown in Tables 2 and 3, of our original 1003 bins for each of 73
  samples, the rankings of the NMR bins based on their regression vector values ranged
  from 30 to 121 for the low-dose bioassay and from 6 to 81 for the high-dose bioassay.
  Furthermore, error analyses of PLS models that were calculated using only anthocyanin-related
  bins proved to be less than optimal when compared to our PLS models containing both
  anthocyanin- and nonanthocyanin-related bins.\n\nAs with other omics approaches,
  the cell assay, provided a simple phenotypic-like response to the treatments, here,
  control of the HT-29 colon cancer cell proliferation. However, just as a simple
  phenotypic response is controlled by changes in many overlapping and/or independent
  biochemical pathways, cell proliferation reflects the combined impacts of the extract
  components on the stimulation of apoptosis, regulation of cell cycle gene expression,
  and the impact of BR extract components on overlapping and independent biochemical
  pathways. Therefore, the model must integrate all of these interactions to determine
  the impact of the extracts on cancer cell growth. This integration then provides
  data to identify compounds that affect any of a myriad of chemical reactions.\n\nCy
  3-xylrut and Cy 3-rut were identified by the model as the most important contributors
  to the inhibition of proliferation of HT-29 colon cancer cells. Anthocyanins constitute
  a major group of phenolic antioxidants produced in most small fruits. According
  to Stoner, anthocyanins are present in BR at concentrations that exceed those of
  ellagic acid by approximately 15-fold and of all other phenolic materials by factors
  of 102 or 103. BR anthocyanins are known to effectively intercede against various
  forms of aerodigestive cancers at several stages by initiating and maintaining the
  enzymatic defenses against oxidative stress, reducing inflammation, and inhibiting
  mutagenesis, as well as decreasing cell proliferation and stimulating apoptosis.
  BR anthocyanins or anthocyanin-rich fractions affect these chemopreventive processes
  at cellular and subcellular levels by direct interaction or interaction with controlling
  elements of kinase-based signaling cascades that influence gene expression, mRNA
  translation, or enzymatic activity of key cancer-related factors.\n\nHowever, the
  model data also support our previous conclusion that the antiproliferative effectiveness
  of these BR extracts is not directly correlated with their TMA contents. When we
  compared the NMR-determined concentrations of individual anthocyanins herein with
  the low- and high-dose bioassay data using a simple Pearson correlation analysis,
  only the Cy 3-rut correlation values  were significant. However, this relationship
  was weak, suggesting that the effects of BR extracts on HT-29 colon cancer cell
  proliferation arise from the activity of multiple compounds in concert. Moreover,
  bins associated with protons of nonanthocyanin constituents appeared to gain in
  importance in the anthocyanin-rich extract/high-dose assay PLS model over their
  position in the model constructed with low-dose assay data developed with extracts
  containing lower levels of anthocyanins. Together, these findings suggest that anthocyanins
  may reach a maximum effect on cells and that further increases in their total content
  or alterations in anthocyanin profiles may not increase the activity of the specific
  extract.\n\nSupporting this contention, Seguin and co-workers recently reported
  four temperate berries  and a cyanidin-containing tropical fruit acai, presumably
  with differing anthocyanin profiles, to be similar in their antiproliferative activities.
  In a study by Wang and co-workers, dietary treatments with freeze-dried BR powder,
  an aqueous ethanol extract, and an anthocyanin-enriched subfraction of the extract
  were found to affect rat esophageal papilloma formation and mass, proteins associated
  with proliferation, and markers of apoptosis similarly.\n\nWang and co-workers also
  noted similar antiproliferative properties associated with a diet formulated with
  the insoluble residue of the extraction with anthocyanin concentrations reduced
  by approximately 200-fold. These authors noted that among the potential nonanthocyanin
  constituents of the extract insoluble residue, ellagitannins  were likely responsible
  for the chemoprotective effects of the residue diet. Due to their low solubility
  in methanol, ellagitannins were likely to be present at minimal concentrations in
  our extracts. However, our model clearly identified MEAAP as one of the important
  antiproliferative components of BR extracts. The metabolism and chemoprotective
  properties of ellagic acid and its polymers, derivatives, and colonic microflora-generated
  metabolites  were recently reviewed by Landete. Similar to other polyphenols, these
  compounds act chemoprotectively by reducing the activity of signaling cascades,
  limiting inflammatory responses, controlling cell cycling and proliferation, reducing
  angiogenesis, and stimulating apoptosis.\n\nOur model also identified epicatechin,
  Q 3-glc, Q 3-rut, SAGE, SAD, BAGE, and p-coumaric acids as important BR extract
  components in the control of HT-29 cell proliferation. Flavan-3-ols, flavonol glycosides,
  and salicylates  are powerful phenolic antioxidants that have been shown to have
  chemopreventive properties against colon cancer and other types of cancers. In vitro
  cell assays and animal studies have shown these compounds inhibit proliferation
  or tumor growth by controlling cell cycle genes and enzymes and by promoting genes
  and enzymes associated with apoptosis. In a study of bioactive constituents isolated
  from freeze-dried strawberry, Zhang and co-workers demonstrated that a p-coumaric
  acid glucose ester strongly inhibited proliferation in two colon cancer cell line
  assays. There is also evidence that hydroxycinnamic acids may play an active role
  in cancer cell regulation when acylated to anthocyanins. The chemopreventive activity
  of hydroxybenzoic acids and their derivatives  has also been extensively studied.
  However, to our knowledge, this is the first report of a benzoic acid glucose ester
  \ showing antiproliferative potential against cancer cells.\n\nAltered metabolism
  favoring cytoplasm-centered aerobic glycolysis is an emerging hallmark of cancer,
  leading to the production of metabolites necessary for continued proliferation and
  sufficient energy for tumor growth. However, aerobic glycolysis and its effects
  can be curtailed by high levels of cytosolic citrate. Elevated citrate levels in
  cancer cells may lead to cell cycle arrest, metabolic changes favoring pro-apoptotic
  over anti-apoptotic proteins, and increased cytosolic- or mitochondrial-induced
  caspase activity leading to cell death in a threshold-dependent manner. The increased
  importance of citric acid derivatives in the high-dose model  perhaps reflects this
  concentration threshold dependency.\n\nThe 1H NMR-based model that was developed
  here has made a significant contribution to our understanding of the impact of the
  crude BR extracts in controlling HT-29 cell proliferation and provides insights
  as to the chemopreventive nature of BR fruits. The nonanthocyanin components of
  the fruit that affect cell proliferation represent a very small percentage of the
  total phenolic and organic acid derivatives found in the BR extracts, but both the
  low- and high-dose models indicated their importance in curtailing cancer cell growth.
  Among the model-identified nonanthocyanin components, Q 3-glc, Q 3-rut, p-coumaric
  acid, and various ellagic acid derivatives have been previously considered as bioactive
  constituents of BR. However, the bioactivity of MEAAP specifically, BR-derived salicylates,
  flavan-3-ols, citric acid derivatives, and/or esters of benzoic acid in controlling
  colon cancer cell proliferation have not been cited to our knowledge in previous
  work. Recognition, by the model, of the contributions of these low-concentration
  constituents on the impact of the extracts on cell growth clearly provides paths
  for new lines of research into the mechanisms of BR constituents. The data will
  lead to studies on the interactive effects of the extracts on the chemoprotective
  nature of berry fruits in general and have demonstrated the utility of using this
  type of approach to the study of the bioactivity of natural products.\n\nFurther
  advanced NMR analysis with unassigned bins  may lead to the identification of additional
  important compounds. As this study was focused on model development and viewed as
  a proof of concept, recognition by the model of all of the important BR bioactive
  compounds was limited by the use of acidic methanol extracts and the in vitro HT-29
  cell proliferation assay. However, our overall approach is readily adaptable to
  modeling the effects of a series of extracts including those containing compounds
  that differ substantially in solubility from that of phenols  and can be adapted
  to accommodate other continuous Y-variables such as control of tumor development,
  enzymatic activity, or biomarker levels, which would lead to a richer understanding
  of the complex mechanisms by which BR compounds may affect carcinogenesis. Likewise,
  our approach can also be applied to assess the activity of other natural products
  with complex NMR spectra, not only against cancer but also for any complex interaction
  that can be evaluated using a biological assay.\n\nTable S1, variability in HT-29
