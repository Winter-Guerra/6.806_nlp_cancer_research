  Copper Lead and Zinc in Cultured Oysters Under two Contrasting Climatic Conditions
  in Coastal Lagoons from SE Gu.md
text: "\n\nIn order to determine the metal concentrations in cultured oysters from
  four coastal lagoons from SE Gulf of California, several individuals of Crassostrea
  gigas and C. corteziensis were collected and their cadmium, copper, lead and zinc
  levels were measured by atomic absorption spectrometry after acid digestion. The
  concentration of metals in oyster soft tissue was Zn &gt; Cu &gt; Cd &gt; Pb. In
  two lagoons, Cd concentrations  exceeded the maximum level allowed according to
  the Official Mexican Standard, which is equivalent to the WHO recommended Cd levels
  in organisms used for human consumption.\n\nCadmium, copper, lead and zinc, accumulate
  in the tissues of aquatic organisms at concentrations higher than in water, may
  be biomagnified in the food chain and cause physiological impairment at higher trophic
  levels and in human consumers. For the purposes of assessing coastal water quality,
  oysters of Crassostrea genus have already been proposed as sentinel organisms for
  marine ecotoxicological tests, because they are very sensitive to pollutants and
  provide a rapid response. The Pacific and the mangrove oysters, are cultivated inside
  coastal lagoons, hence the oysters are susceptible to contamination by metals and
  other chemicals. Therefore, this study was conducted to determine and compare the
  concentration of Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn in the soft tissue of C. gigas and C. corteziensis
  specimens from four coastal lagoons.\n\nThis study was performed at four oyster
  farms located in four coastal lagoons from Sinaloa state, SE Gulf of California,
  Mexico: El Colorado, Santa Mara-La Reforma, Altata  and Ceuta. A total of six samples
  of cultured oysters C. gigas and two samples of C. corteziensis  were collected
  during the dry and rainy season in duplicate. Once cleaned, the oyster shells were
  measured  and weighed. The condition index  was determined by: CI = /shell dry wt.
  The soft tissue of the groups  was extracted, homogenized, freeze-dried over 72
  h  and then ground in an automatic agate mortar. Finally, they were kept frozen
  until their digestion. Analyses were carried out by atomic absorption spectrometry
  with flame detection  and grafite furnace. For metal quality control purposes, certified
  mussel material  was analyzed. The limits of detection were 0.06, 3.6, 0.44 and
  11.3 g g1, for Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn, respectively. Additionally, one blank was included
  per each set of 14 samples. One-way analysis of variance  was performed, which showed
  significant differences between the mean concentrations, and correlation analysis
  \ were used in order to find the relationships among the concentrations of these
  metals in the oysters.\n\nLocation of the study area: coastal lagoons from Sinaloa,
  where cultured oysters were collected. The point  indicates the approximate position
  of the farms\n\nIn spite that organisms had similar sizes, the mean weights were
  different from one season to another, therefore, the soft tissue weight was higher
  in samples from the dry season, when the condition index is greater. The concentration
  of metals in oyster soft tissues were Zn &gt; Cu &gt; Cd &gt; Pb, and their global
  mean concentrations for C. gigas for the rainy and dry season were 8.05  2.60 and
  11.30  2.70 g g1  for Cd, 35.1  16.1 and 16.0  10.3 for Cu, 1.52  0.43 and 0.92
  \ 0.45 for Pb, and 342  116 and 156  41 for Zn, respectively. For this species,
  higher mean concentrations of Cd were found during the dry season, as well as for
  C. corteziensis in CEU lagoon. This increase on the bioavailability of Cd during
  dry season could be explained by the presence of upwelling regime during this season,
  since the Gulf of California is characterized by the upwellings events along its
  eastern coast, normally from February to April. The average Cd concentration trend
  for the C. gigas specimens were SMLR &gt; CEU &gt; EC and SMLR &gt; ALT &gt; CEU,
  during the rainy and dry seasons, respectively. At both cases, the oysters from
  SMLR had the highest concentrations. This could be related to the extension of the
  lagoon mouth at SMLR  and its closer distance from the farm location. For Cu, Pb
  and Zn, the highest concentrations were found during the rainy season in all the
  lagoons, for both species, which is in agreement with Fras-Espericueta et al., who
  found the highest concentrations of Cu, Pb and Zn in autumn, when the oysters were
  in resting phase. Besides, this pattern implies a higher input of these metals from
  the watershed. These three metals showed the same trend among the concentration
  levels of the different lagoons at both seasons, except for Zn during rainy season.
  However; in all cases SMLR had the lowest concentrations in contrast to the Cd results.
  Again, its position farthest from the inlet could be playing an important role in
  the availability of these three metals.\n\nRange of metal concentrations  in Crassostrea
  oysters species from Mexico and other world regions  \n\nMetal concentrations in
  the oysters from the coastal lagoons. The maximum tolerable values are indicated
  by dashed lines, rainy and dry season data are represented by filled and unfilled
  bars, respectively. Different letters for a particular metal show significant differences
  \ among sites\n\nA linear model was applied in which the Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn concentrations
  in the tissues of C. gigas were plotted as a function of the CI; the results showed
  only a good correlation coefficient for Zn, which was negatively correlated to the
  CI ; which is in agreement with the analyses made in mussels  by Mubiana et al.
  \ and in the same oysters for Hg. Bivariate correlation analyses  among these four
  metals were made; the results showed a significant correlation just for Cu-Pb, while
  Pb showed to be closely related to Zn, but it did not reached a significant correlation.
  These results differ from the ones found for C. iridescens, which show no correlation
  for Cu-Pb and a negative correlation for PbZn. Nevertheless, they are in agreement
  to the correlations found for the mussels Mytilus galloprovincialis. Such correlations
  indicate that the metals involved have similar physical/chemical properties of the
  involved elements.\n\nAccording to the WHO  and the Official Mexican Standard, the
  maximum permissible levels for these metals are equivalent to 10, 50, 5 and 500
  g g1, dry wt  for Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn, respectively. Cd levels exceeded the permitted
  levels in ALT during the dry season and in SMLR during both seasons; Cu concentration
  was higher than the permitted level in EC only during dry season; while Pb and Zn
  showed levels lower than the permitted limit. The Expert Committee on Food Additives
  \ has established regulatory guidelines regarding the dietary intake of metals,
  it recommends for Cd, a provisional tolerable weekly intake  of 7 g kg1 body weight.
  Such concentration is equivalent to 490 g Cd/week for a 70 kg person. According
  to the results of this study, during the dry season, the mean concentration of Cd
  in both cultured species was 8.5 g g1 dry wt, equivalent to 42.5 g g1 wet wt. Therefore,
  ca. 11.53 g wet wt is the total weekly maximum amount of oysters harvested from
  this region that could be consumed by a 70 kg person without exceeding a body cadmium
  concentration of 7 g kg1 on a weekly basis. Normally, the persons consume 6 or until
  12 oysters, consequently, such PTWI may be easily reached. From these results is
  evident the risk of Cd by consumption of these oysters and the need of more research
  in this context is justified.\n\nIn the case of the CEU samples, both species were
  collected from the same farm ; therefore, they were exposed under the same water
  conditions and levels of metals. Although there were a limited number of samples
  collected, the analysis of correlation of metal content between the two species:
  C. corteziensis  and C. gigas  revealed a significant correlation  for Cu, y = 0.484,
  x + 2.514 ; Pb, y = 0.348, x + 0.079 ; and Zn, y = 0.349, x + 62.213. These equations
  may be useful in the intercomparison of metals levels among different sites involving
  these two species in monitoring programs. In the case of Cd, although was obtained
  a r = 0.89, it was not statistically significant. Clearly a higher number of samples
  are required to examine reliably such correlations.\n\nTable 1 shows a comparison
  between metal concentrations in C. gigas and C. corteziensis from different sites
  around the world and the values found in this study. In the case of Cd for both
  species, the determined concentrations in this study are higher than the registered
  for other sites of the world. But for C. corteziensis they are comparable with the
  results of studies done in the same region. The Cu and Pb concentrations are comparable
  \ or less  and the Zn levels are less, for both species, than the levels found in
  other regions. From this work, emerge the need of research the mechanisms and sources
  of metals associated with the enrichment of such metals in cultured oysters in both
  seasons; which apparently for Cu, Pb and Zn is connected in rainy months with transported
  material from the watershed, while in dry season the higher availability of Cd is
  related to upwellings in the Gulf of California.\n\nThe authors thank H. Bojrquez-Leyva
