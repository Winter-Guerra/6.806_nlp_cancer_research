  Conclusions drawn from meta-analyses on the association between soy isoflavone intake
  and breast cancer risk for pre- and post-menopausal women are not fully consistent.
  These meta-analyses did not explore the influence of different study designs on
  the pooled results on the basis of distinguishing between pre- and post-menopausal
  women.


  We performed a meta-analysis of 35 studies which reported results of association
  between soy isoflavone intake and breast cancer risk for pre- and/or post-menopausal
  women, calculated pooled odds ratios and their 95% confidence intervals of pre-
  and post-menopausal women respectively, and further explored soy isoflavone-breast
  cancer association on the basis of considering different study regions and designs.
  Summary results suggested that soy isoflavone intake has a protective effect against
  breast cancer for both pre- and post-menopausal women. However, they are influenced
  by study design and region. Pooled ORs of studies carried out in Asian countries
  suggested that soy isoflavones protective effect exist in both pre- and post-menopausal
  women. However, there are some differences between the results pooled from different
  study designs for women in Asian countries. Pooled OR of studies on postmenopausal
  women in Western countries suggested that soy isoflavone intake has a marginally
  significant protective effect, but further analyses stratifying by study design
  found no statistically significant association.


  We meta-analyzed more and newer research results, and separated women according
  to menopausal status to explore soy isoflavone-breast cancer association. We founded
  that soy isoflavone intake could lower the risk of breast cancer for both pre- and
  post-menopausal women in Asian countries. However, for women in Western countries,
  pre- or post-menopausal, there is no evidence to suggest an association between
  intake of soy isoflavone and breast cancer.

  Epidemiologic studies have explored the association between soy isoflavone intake
  and breast cancer risk since Lee HP et al.  reported that soy protein may lower
  breast cancer risk for premenopausal women. However, these findings are highly variable,
  especially on soy isoflavone-breast cancer association drawn for pre- and post-menopausal
  women. Meta-analyses published so far have not drawn a consistent conclusion. Bruce
  JT et al.  concluded that the protective effect of soy isoflavone was somewhat stronger
  in premenopausal women than in postmenopausal women. However, AH Wu et al.  have
  reported that menopausal status may has no modifying effect on the soy-breast cancer
  association, and meta-analyses by Dong JY et al.  and Zhong X et al.  suggested
  that the protective effect of soy isoflavone  intake for breast cancer exists among
  postmenopausal women only. Results of some Randomized Controlled Trials  indicated
  that isoflavone has a different impact on pre- and post-menopausal womens mammary
  density. Lee H et al.  meta-analyzed these RCTs results and concluded that isoflavone
  intake does not alter the mammary density in postmenopausal women, but may slightly
  increase it in premenopausal women.


  When explored the soy isoflavone-breast cancer association stratified by menopausal
  status, previous meta-analyses rarely further considered the influence of different
  study regions and designs. Given the inconsistence of these results, we conducted
  an up-to-date meta-analysis of the soy isoflavone-breast cancer association in pre-
  and post-menopausal women, examining the association  stratified by study region
  and soy isoflavone exposure measurement et al., and fully took study designs influence
  on these pooled results into consideration, aiming at exploring the association
  between soy isoflavone intake and breast cancer risk for pre- and post-menopausal
  women systematically.


  This study was reviewed and approved by the ethical committee of School of Public
  Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan,
  China.


  The PRISMA checklist is available as an appendix. An electronic literature search
  of PubMed and Web of Science was conducted using the following search terms: isoflavone,
  soy, breast cancer and menopausal. All publications up to January 2013 were considered.
  Simultaneously, we reviewed citations listed in retrieved articles to identify additional
  studies. No attempt was made to obtain unpublished data.


  Two reviewers searched literature with the same retrieval strategy independently,
  assessed retrieved titles and abstracts, and downloaded potentially relevant articles
  for further assessment of inclusion. If multiple papers reported results from the
  same study cohort, whether research participants overlapped, degree of conformance
  to the predefined inclusion criteria, and publication year were comprehensively
  reviewed to select the appropriate papers for the analysis.


  The same two reviewers read full-text articles independently, and extracted the
  following information from the original articles: name of the first author, publication
  year, study region, study design, number of cases and controls or person-years,
  exposure measurement, the most adjusted odds ratios in case-control studies or relative
  risk  in cohort studies and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals  comparing
  the highest vs. lowest  level of soy isoflavone intake, and the adjustment factors
  in multivariable models. Disagreements on data extraction were resolved through
  discussion.


  The pooled ORs estimating the association between soy isoflavone intake and breast
  cancer risk for pre- and post-menopausal women separately were calculated. If multiple
  exposure measurements of soy isoflavone were reported to evaluate the association
  with breast cancer risk, the priority order of isoflavone, soy protein, soy foods/soy
  products  was taken in summary analyses. In subgroup analyses, we took full advantage
  of reported results as needed.


  Q test was used to test the homogeneity of results across studies, and I2 was calculated
  to quantify the heterogeneity among studies, if P;0.10, it means that there was
  significant heterogeneity, and random-effects model was used to obtain the pooled
  estimates. Otherwise, fixed-effects model was applied.


  In order to make comparisons between pooled estimates obtained from different study
  designs, we calculated the pooled RR  in cohort or nested case-control studies and
  retrospective case-control studies  for all predefined subgroups. The ratio of OR1/OR2  was
  calculated and z-statistic  was used to test whether the difference between OR1
  and OR2 is significant.


  We deleted studies that limited soy isoflavone intake to special period or measured
  soy isoflavone intake with a significantly different method from others. We performed
  sensitive analyses to evaluate the robustness of summary results.


  Potential publication bias was examined with Egger method, which implements a weighted
  linear regression of the logarithm of the odds ratios on their standard errors,
  simultaneously, funnel plots were given for a visual inspection on publication bias.
  If P value obtained from Egger test was &lt;0.10, then we considered that potential
  publication bias exists.


  1335 citations were retrieved by electronic searching, and 23 articles were identified
  by bibliographic searching. 84 articles were potentially relevant after titles and
  abstracts were read. Among them, 36 articles did not meet the predefined includsion
  criteria after reviewing the full paper by two independent reviewers, and 13 articles
  were excluded for repetitive reporting results from the same studies. Finally, 35
  studies were included in the meta-analysis, including 26 studies reporting the association
  between soy isoflavone intake and breast cancer risk for both pre- and post-menopausal
  women, 4 studies reporting the association in premenopausal women only, and the
  remaining 5 studies in postmenopausal women only. Therefore, results from 30 studies
  were included to assess the soy isoflavone-breast cancer association among premenopausal
  women, and 31 studies were included for assessing the association in postmenopausal
  women. Figure 1 presents the flowchart of the study selection process.


  Of the 30 studies assessing the association between soy isoflavone intake and breast
  cancer risk in premenopausal women, 10 studies are cohort or nested case-control
  study  and 20 studies are case-control study. Of the 31 studies on postmenopausal
  women, 12 are cohort or nested case-control studies, and 19 are case-control studies.
  Most studies included the results adjusted for a wide range of potential confounding
  factors, including age, alcohol and smoking, body mass index, energy intake and
  hormone replacement therapy. Table S1 shows the characteristics of the included
  studies, and the other two excel documents named Excel S1 and Excel S2 respectively
  present pre- and post-menopausal womens information with different sheets displaying
  data information of specific study characteristics.


  There is something needed special attention: two studies  gave results stratified
  by receptor type. Laura NA  reported results of ER+/PR+, ER/PR and ER+/PR three
  receptor types, Min Z  stratified receptor type according to ER and PR status and
  reported results for ER+, ER, PR+ and PR respectively. For the latter, we extracted
  results of ER+ and ER. Therefore, we take  as three and  as two separated studies
  to make meta-analysis. Similarily, Motoki I et al.  carried out their study in Japan
  and Brazil, and they reported results of pre- and post-menopausal women who were
  Japanese, Japanese living in Brazil and non-Japanese living in Brazil apart, since
  study region is a stratified factor we predefined, we also included Motoki I et
  al.  as three individual studies for analysis.

  soy isoflavone intake  associating with breast cancer risk, calculated from summary
  and stratified  analyses.


  Summary results of 30 studies exploring the soy isoflavone-breast cancer association
  for premenopausal women indicates that soy isoflavone intake was inversely associated
  with breast cancer risk. When stratified by study region, 17 studies carried out
  in Asian countries suggested that soy isoflavone was protective in premenopausal
  Asian women to some extent, while 14 studies in Western nations didnt obtain a statistically
  significant association. Figure 2 shows the forest plot presenting soy isoflavone-breast
  cancer association in premenopausal women. The word document entitled Forest Plots
  S1 presents forest plots with weights for subgroup analyses  which were further
  stratified by study design, meanwhile, heterogeneity statistics for each stratified
  analysis were listed below each forest plot.

  all studies and studies carried out in Asian or Western countries among premenopausal
  women.


  Relative weights are indicated by the area of square. Horizontal lines represent
  95% confidence intervals for the odds ratios.


  Then we stratified these 30 studies by measurement of soy isoflavone and publication
  year. ORs and their 95% CIs pooled from 22 studies using soy isoflavone or soy protein
  as intake measurement and 11 studies using that of soy bean/soy products were  and  respectively,
  both suggested that soy isoflavone had a protective effect in premenopausal women,
  while the latter was somewhat stronger. Similar pooled ORs were observed in 18 recently
  published studies  and 12 earlier studies..


  Pooled result from 31 studies estimating the association between soy isoflavone
  intake and breast cancer risk among postmenopausal women indicates that highest
  intake of soy isoflavone vs. lowest intake could decrease breast cancer risk by
  about 25% for postmenopausal women. When stratified by study region, 18 studies
  carried out in Asian countries pooled a result suggesting an inverse soy isoflavone-breast
  cancer association, while a weak but statistically significant inverse association
  was found among postmenopausal women living in Western nations. Figure 3 shows the
  forest plot of OR/RR estimates for postmenopausal women. The word document entitled
  Forest Plots S2 presents forest plots with weights for subgroup analyses  which
  were further stratified by study design, meanwhile, heterogeneity statistics for
  each stratified analysis were listed below each forest plot.

  Similarly, we stratified these 31 studies according to measurement of soy isoflavone
  intake and publication year and pooled OR estimates. 21 studies used soy isoflavone
  or soy protein as intake measurement, and 13 studies used soy bean or soy products.
  Pooled ORs and their 95% CIs were OR = 0.73; 95%CI: 0.58~0.88 and OR = 0.72; 95%CI:
  0.48~0.97, respectively. Both of them suggested a protective effect of soy isoflavone
  to postmenopausal women. Earlier studies  and later studies  obtained similar pooled
  ORs..


  Table 2.  Comparison of soy isoflavone-breast cancer association among studies by
  study design.


  Of 30 studies assessing soy isoflavone intake-breast cancer association in premenopausal
  women, 10 were cohort or nested case-control studies, and 20 were retrospective
  case-control studies. The pooled OR estimates obtained from cohort or nested case-control
  studies did not suggest an association between soy isoflavone intake and breast
  cancer, while the pooled OR from case-control studies hinted a protective effect
  of soy isoflavone to premenopausal women. Difference between these two pooled results
  was statistically significant, as indicated by ORC.


  4 cohort and 13 case-control studies carried out in Asian area obtained pooled ORs
  of 0.77, 95%CI: 0.37~1.18 and 0.56, 95%CI: 0.45~0.66, respectively. The former didnt
  suggest an inverse association between soy isoflavone intake and breast cancer risk,
  but the latter did. And the difference between these two had no statistically significance.
  Studies in Western countries obtained similar results.


  2 cohort studies and 9 case-control studies using soy bean/soy products as intake
  measurement suggested an inverse association between soy isoflavone intake and breast
  cancer risk, their pooled ORs were OR = 0.78; 95%CI: 0.57~0.99 and OR = 0.61; 95%CI:
  0.44~0.78 respectively. However, 8 cohort studies using soy isoflavone didnt suggest
  any association, but case-control studies did. And the difference between these
  two had statistically significance. In addition, for studies published from 2006
  to most recently, case-control studies was associated with a stronger protective
  associations than cohort studies.


  12 cohort studies and 19 case-control studies exploring the soy isoflavone-breast
  cancer association among postmenopausal women obtained pooled ORs of 0.86, 95%CI:
  0.73~1.00 and 0.69, 95%CI: 0.54~0.83, respectively. Both suggested a protective
  effect of soy isoflavone for postmenopausal women, and the difference between them
  was not statistically significant. However, we must be cautious of the significant
  inverse association pooled from all cohort studies: when we stratified 12 cohort
  studies by publication year or study region, all the 4 pooled ORs were not statistically
  significant.


  For women residing in Asian area, difference between two pooled ORs analyzed from
  5 cohort studies  and 13 case-control studies had statistically significantly difference.
  Here, case-control studies hinted a strong inverse association between soy isoflavone
  intake and breast cancer risk. Pooled OR of 7 cohort studies and that of 7 case-control
  studies carried out in Western countries didnt suggest an association. These results
  warned us that we should reassess the weak but statistically significant inverse
  association among Western postmenopausal women reported in section 2.2.


  8 cohort studies and 13 case-control studies using soy isoflavone as intake measurement
  suggested an inverse association between soy isoflavone intake and breast cancer
  risk, their pooled ORs were OR = 0.82; 95%CI: 0.65~0.99 and OR = 0.69; 95%CI: 0.49~0.88
  respectively. However, 4 cohort studies using soy bean/soy products didnt suggest
  any association. In addition, when studies published later  were stratified by study
  design, the statistically significant difference between two pooled ORs suggested
  case-control studies was associated with a stronger protective associations.


  Xiao OS  limited intake period of soy foods to adolescence and assessed its association
  with subsequent breast cancer risk. Martijn V  and Heather W  used plasma genistein
  and total urinary isoflavones as intake measurements to evaluate their association
  with breast cancer risk, which were different from the other included studies. Therefore,
  we deleted these three studies in a sensitive analysis. Heterogeneity among studies
  decreased a little bit  but remained, thus we used random effects model, and pooled
  OR and its corresponding 95%CI were 0.73, which was very close to overall summary
  pooled OR.


  Besides 3 studies  mentioned above, Theodore MB et al.  carried out their study
  in America, and explored whether soy supplement intake was associated with postmenopausal
  womens breast cancer risk. Similar to studies reported by Martijn V  and Heather
  W, Isoide DT  reported odds ratio for urinary genistein excretion in association
  with breast cancer risk for postmenopausal women. Hence, 5 studies  were excluded
  when employed in a sensitive analysis for postmenopausal women. We found that heterogeneity
  changed a little, and random effect model was used to obtain pooled a OR of 0.74,
  which was also similar to the overall summary pooled OR.


  Egger regression test was carried out for 30 studies included in the premenopausal
  women analysis, and a significant publication bias was observed. And funnel plot
  also showed an asymmetrical distribution. Then we employed Egger regression test
  for Asian studies and Western studies separately. Potential publication bias was
  found among Western studies, but not among Asian studies.

  error  of log  among premenopausal women.

  Asia.


  Visually, the funnel plot had an asymmetrical distribution. Egger regression test
  suggested a potential publication bias in 31 studies included in meta-analysis for
  postmenopausal women. Further Egger tests stratified by study region obtained results
  opposite to premenopausal womens: publication bias was not found among Western studies,
  but observed among Asian studies.

  Soy foods or soy products are rich source of isoflavone, which presents both weak
  estrogenic and anti-estrogenic effects,. Premenopausal women are greatly different
  from postmenopausal women in endogenous estrogen level, and that breast cancer is
  a disease closely associated with hormone. Therefore, menopausal status may play
  a modifying role in soy isoflavone-breast cancer association. Recently, abundant
  studies in this field are constantly emerging, and more and more studies set premenopausal
  women apart from postmenopausal women and reported OR/RR estimates for breast cancer
  risk associated with soy isoflavone intake respectively. Laura NA et al.  reported
  results gained from a population based case-control study: adult isoflavone intake
  had no effects on the incidence of breast cancer for both pre- and post-menopausal
  women. Moreover, they concluded that adult isoflavone intake was positively associated
  with ER/PR tumors among postmenopausal women. Considering the inconsistence of results
  in a number of studies, it appears essential to summarize more and newer study results
  in understanding the soy isoflavone-breast cancer association for pre- and post-menopausal
  women.


  Our meta-analysis included 35 studies. There were 30 studies results for premenopausal
  women, and 31 studies for postmenopausal women. Summary results suggested that high
  soy isoflavone intake presents some protective effects on breast cancer for both
  pre- and post-menopausal women. However, we must be cautious, because results were
  influenced by study design, especially for premenopausal women. Pooled ORs of cohort
  studies were statistically different from pooled ORs of case-control studies, the
  latter hinted a strong protective effect of soy isoflavone in premenopausal women,
  but cohort studies didnt obtain a statistically significant association. Previous
  meta-analyses,,  drew similar conclusions when stratified the analyses by study
  design without separating pre- and post-menopausal women apart, and they didnt make
  comparisons between pooled OR estimates from studies of different designs. There
  is great difference between prospective cohort and retrospective case-control studies.
  Relatively speaking, case-control studies inevitably suffer some drawbacks like
  recall and selection biases. Therefore, pooled results which did not stratified
  by study design are debatable, especially for those ORs which are very close to
  1. Pooled results of studies published earlier  evaluating soy isoflavone intakes
  association with postmenopausal womens breast cancer risk and pooled result for
  Western postmenopausal women both corroborated the above opinion. Stratifying pooled
  results by study design were intended to check whether corresponding results will
  be biased by study design.


  Published 4 meta-analyses ,  all concluded that soy isoflavone/soy food intake was
  inversely associated with breast cancer risk among Asian women, but this association
  did not exist among Western women. Our meta-analysis drew a conclusion that an inverse
  association between soy isoflavone and breast cancer risk existed among both pre-
  and post-menopausal women in Asian. However, in terms of Asian postmenopausal women,
  the difference between pooled OR estimates of studies stratified by study design
  was statistically significant, suggesting that difference in study design contributed
  to heterogeneity among studies. Although the pooled OR estimate for postmenopausal
  women in Western nations suggested a protective effect of soy isoflavone, the protective
  effect disappeared when stratified by study design. This indicated that drawing
  a conclusion that soy isoflavone intake could lower breast cancer risk for Western
  postmenopausal women may be not so reliable. The weak protective effect could be
  just a result from statistical chance finding. It appeared that soy isoflavone intake
  had no influence on breast cancer risk among pre- and post-menopausal women in Western
  countries. Exposure to soy isoflavone in early life and high intake level may be
  important contributing elements for its protective effect to Asian women. And non-association
  between soy isoflavone intake and breast cancer risk among Western pre-and post-menopausal
  women may be related to their low intake levels of soy isoflavone which couldnt
  come into play yet in low dose.


  Some studies,,  reported ORs/RRs for breast cancer risk in association with multiple
  assessments of soy isoflavone exposure simultaneously. We found that pooled OR estimates
  of results using soy isoflavone/soy protein as exposure measurement were very close
  to summary results for both pre- and post-menopausal women. However, for premenopausal
  women, pooled ORs of soybean/soy foods intake and breast cancer risk was different
  from summary result. As for the reason, we consider that most of the included studies
  took isoflavone as an intake measurement, but some studies using soybean/soy products  as
  intake measurements as additional results in subgroup analyses. Furthermore, for
  studies using soy isoflavone/soy protein as exposure measurements, both pooled estimates
  of cohort studies and case-control studies hinted a protective association between
  soy isoflavone intake and breast cancer risk among postmenopausal women. The influence
  to pooled results caused by difference in exposure measurements cannot be ignored.
  Future studies in this field should quantify isoflavone as accurate as possible
  with comprehensive soy foods items to evaluate its association with breast cancer
  risk. Although isoflavone may be the major substance impacting breast cancer risk,
  we cant assert that there is nothing else work similarly. In addition, the amount
  of isoflavone varies greatly among different soy foods. if we assess soy foods intake
  generally and take it as isoflavone without measurement transformation to estimate
  its association with breast cancer risk, the inaccuracy of intake measurement is
  inevitable. This may be an important source of heterogeneity.


  Although our method of estimating pooled OR was a little different from Trock et
  al., we found that pooled OR estimates of studies published before 2006  were similar
  to pooled ORs of Trock et al.. The inverse association between soy isoflavone intake
  and breast cancer risk was somewhat stronger in premenopausal women than in postmenopausal
  women. However, we must prudently treat pooled results of postmenopausal women :
  pooled result of neither cohort nor case-control studies suggested a significant
  inverse association. So, the protective effect of soy isoflavone in postmenopausal
  women  appears to be questionable. This, once again, proved that it is necessary
  to employ stratified analyses by study design in summary comparisons. In addition,
  pooled ORs of later published cohort studies  didnt suggest a protective effect
  of soy isoflavone, and the differences between pooled ORs of studies of different
  designs were statistically significant. Hence we can see that the association between
  soy isoflavone intake and breast cancer risk is influenced by study design to a
  large extent.


  Three studies ,  used urine or plasma isoflavone level to assess exposure, these
  methods avoided measurement inaccuracy in using food frequency questionnaire to
  evaluate low dietary soy isoflavone intake, but urinary/plasma isoflavone level
  could just reflect short-term intake status of participants, hence the randomness
  couldnt be ignored. Thus it couldnt represent dietary intake level and may be a
  major source of nondifferential measurement errors. Together with two studies,  limited
  to soy isoflavone intake in adolescence  or soy supplement intake, we deleted these
  5 studies in sensitive analyses, and found that pooled OR estimates changed little
  for both pre- and post-menopausal women, demonstrating the robustness of our summary
  pooled results.


  We avoid mistakes reported by Allyson Delaune et al.  in their critical appraisal
  paper concerning the credibility of a meta-analysis about the role of dietary soy
  intake in reducing breast cancer risk. Still, some limitations exist in our meta-analysis
  should be cautioned: heterogeneity among studies, diversity in intake measurements,
  and potential publication bias. Besides, we only compared the estimates of highest
  vs. lowest groups of soy isoflavone intake for breast cancer risk. Further dose-response
  relationship should be analyzed to more accurately estimate soy isoflavone-breast
  cancer risk association in future studies. Actually, in a recently published paper,
  Qi Xie et al.  conducted a dose-response meta-analysis of observational studies,
  and they drew similar conclusions as we did, which further strengths the credibility
  of our conclusions to some extent.


  And it is noteworthy that two newly published articles  concerned the association
  between soy food intake after cancer diagnosis with breast cancer survival. Although
  the endpoints and the study populations of these two studies are different from
  our study, their conclusions are very inspiring. Their findings further confirmed
  the protective effect of soy isoflavone for breast cancer. In additional, Feng Chi
  et al.  also concluded that menopausal status could influence the association between
  soy food intake after cancer diagnosis with breast cancer recurrence. It, once again,
  proved the modifying effect of menopausal status, and showed that separating pre-
  and post-menopausal women to explore the soy isoflavone-breast cancer risk association
  might be the right approach and something has to be taken into consideration.


  In summary, our meta-analysis shows that soy isoflavone presents a protective effect
  for Asian pre- and post-menopausal women to some extent, but not for Western women.
  Further stratified and compared results  gave us warnings: when we treat pooled
  estimates, adequate attention should be paid to study designs influence: pooled
  ORs from case-control studies with lower demonstrate strength tend to suggest an
  inverse association between soy isoflavone intake and breast cancer risk. However,
  pooled ORs from cohort studies hardly indicate soy isoflavones effect on breast
  cancer. Therefore, pooled results regardless of study design may be biased to some
  extent. For these reasons, we shouldnt be arbitrary when draw conclusions according
  to pooled results, especially for some marginally significant effect.
