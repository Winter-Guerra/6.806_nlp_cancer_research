  Properties of the Main Triterpenes Found in Olives Virgin Olive Oil and Leaves of
  Olea europaea.md
text: '


  Oleanolic acid, maslinic acid, uvaol, and erythrodiol are the main triterpenes present
  in olives, olive tree leaves, and virgin olive oil. Their concentration in virgin
  olive oil depends on the quality of the olive oil and the variety of the olive tree.
  These triterpenes are described to present different properties, such as antitumoral
  activity, cardioprotective activity, anti-inflammatory activity, and antioxidant
  protection. Olive oil triterpenes are a natural source of antioxidants that could
  be useful compounds for the prevention of multiple diseases related to cell oxidative
  damage. However, special attention has to be paid to the concentrations used, because
  higher concentration may lead to cytotoxic or biphasic effects. This work explores
  all of the bioactive properties so far described for the main triterpenes present
  in virgin olive oil.

  Nowadays there is an increasing interest in healthy eating habits and physical care
  to improve our health and quality of life. In fact, government and educational agencies
  are trying to re-educate the eating habits of the population.


  Mediterranean habits are known to be among the healthiest to improve age-dependent
  vascular activity, and they have proved to be beneficial for several diseases such
  as the metabolic syndrome or coronary heart disease.


  Mediterranean habits include exercising regularly and following the so-called Mediterranean
  diet. This diet consists of bread, cereal, rice, pasta, fruits, and vegetables mainly
  and olive oil as the principal source of fat. Virgin olive oil has been described
  to possess bioactive properties such as cardioprotective effects, commonly associated
  with high levels of monounsaturated fatty acids, but these effects would not necessarily
  be promoted by MUFA alone. Antioxidant and antiatherogenic activities, antiproliferative
  and pro-apoptotic capacities on human cancer cell lines, protection against oxidative
  DNA damage, and anti-inflammatory properties have been described mostly in its minor
  compounds. Virgin olive oil is composed by triacylglycerides and 12% of minor components.
  It can be divided into two fractions, the unsaponifiable fraction, extracted with
  solvents after the saponification of the oil, and the saponifiable fraction. In
  the unsaponifiable fraction of virgin olive oil there are triterpenic alcohols and
  other pentacyclic triterpenes, which together form the main triterpenes of virgin
  olive oil.


  However, very little is known about the activity of this group of compounds, known
  as triterpenes, present in the leaves and skin of olives and in virgin olive oil,
  too. In this paper, we summarize the effects of the major triterpenes present in
  virgin olive oil described so far, and the key factors of their action regarding
  their role in the oxidation mechanism of the cell.


  The main triterpenes of virgin olive oil are oleanolic acid, maslinic acid, uvaol,
  and erythrodiol. These two hydroxyl pentacyclic triterpene acids  and these two
  dialcohols  are differentiated according to the function present at the C-17 position.
  Maslinic acid has two vicinal hydroxyl groups at the C-2 and C-3 positions, besides
  the carboxyl radical. Uvaol and erythrodiol possess two hydroxyl groups in remote
  positions and are different with regard to the methyl group location. These triterpenes
  are found in olive skin and the leaves of olive trees. The Picual variety showed
  the highest content of triterpenes in olives. The various types of commercial black
  and green olives ranged from 460 to 1470 mg/kg fruit. Natural black olives, not
  treated with NaOH, showed concentration &gt;2000 mg/kg in the olive flesh. The leaf
  contains important amounts of oleanolic acid, followed by maslinic acid and minor
  levels of erythrodiol and uvaol. The content of triterpenoids changes during leaf
  ontogeny. Otherwise, in virgin olive oil, the concentration oscillated between 8.90
  and 112.36 mg/kg. Allouche et al. concluded that the high variability observed in
  virgin olive oil triterpenic composition was due to genetic factors. High triterpenic
  content was obtained from 4 of the 40 varieties. Other authors point out that the
  concentration of hydroxyl pentacyclic triterpene acids depends on the quality of
  olive oil. Finally, it is recognized that triterpene concentration varies depending
  on the type of cultivation and the handling of olive oil. In fact, triterpenes are
  present in higher concentrations in olive pomace oil than in virgin olive oils.


  Figure 1. Chemical structures of oleanolic and maslinic acids and uvaol and erythrodiol
  dialcohols of olive oil.


  Very few papers describe the bioavailability of pentacyclic triterpenes from virgin
  olive oil intake, but some reveal interesting data from bioavailability in humans
  and rats.


  After oral administration of 50 mg/kg to rats, a maximum concentration of 0.29  0.26
  M was observed at 21  17 min; oleanolic acid was minimally absorbed, with an absolute
  oral bioavailibity of 0.7%. In humans, the plasmatic concentrations determined in
  healthy male volunteers after a single oral administration of 40 mg was 26.5  15
  nM at 5.2  2.9 h. Rada et al. show that oleanolic acid and human serum proteins
  have molecular interactions between them, and these serum proteins are known for
  the important role in the binding of basic and neutral drugs. These authors demonstrated
  the formation of complexes between human serum proteins and OA.


  Maslinic acid after a single oral administration  to rats is absorbed in the intestine
  and reaches the blood, where it is found 10 min after the oral administration and
  can still be detected in plasma after 60 min.


  For uvaol and erythrodiol, we have not found in the literature consulted any reference
  concerning bioavailability.


  Another important issue is the concentration used by the different authors in all
  of the different studies. Snchez-Gonzlez et al. described an interesting property
  of maslinic acid, namely, its safety. In this paper, authors examined the administration
  of 50 mg/kg of maslinic acid for 28 days and a single oral administration of 1000
  mg/kg to mice. Their results show that this compound does not produce any adverse
  effects on the variables tested in mice, suggesting its use as a nutraceutical.
  We have to pay attention to the concentrations used with each triterpene because
  Lu et al. described another aspect of oleanolic acid, its hepatotoxic effect in
  mice in a dose-dependent manner. Oleanolic acid causes body weight loss, inflammation
  and hepatocellular apoptosis, necrosis, and feathery degeneration  in mice. Depending
  on the concentration used and exposure time, the effect could be contrarily adverse
  or even have a biphasic effect; for example, Allouche et al. observed an antithrombotic
  effect after 10 min of incubation period and a prothrombotic effect when the incubation
  period was prolonged to 20 min, which was attributed to alteration of maslinic acid
  after an extended exposure time with prothrombinase complex. Marquez-Martin et al.
  showed that the behavior of oleanolic acid and uvaol was suggestive of a biphasic
  response in terms of TNF- production. There was an increase at low concentrations  and
  a decrease at higher ones. Therefore, it seems that depending on the concentration
  and time used, these triterpenes have different effects on body response. Consequently,
  more studies are needed about the bioavailability and metabolism of these triterpenes
  with virgin olive oil and olive ingestion to be able to assess the potential effect
  that they could have with diet intake. Future studies should be adapted to the bioavailability
  concentration found for each triterpene; in this way the results obtained could
  be more reliable.


  In the past years, there have been a growing number of studies focusing on the activity
  of the virgin olive oil triterpenes. Antitumoral, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant,
  hepatoprotective, cardioprotective, and antimicrobial activities have been recently
  described. Here we analyze the different bioactivities of these compounds against
  different diseases and conditions and future possible applications.


  Some of the risk factors of cardiovascular diseases are age, sex, and genetic makeup.
  These are not modifiable, but there are other risk factors that could be altered.
  Among the modifiable risk factors the following, among others, should be included:
  levels of high-density lipoprotein  cholesterol, levels of low-density lipoprotein  cholesterol,
  obesity, tobacco, levels of circulating oxidized LDL, hypertension, endothelial
  dysfunction, and oxidative stress, among others. Nowadays, a high number of myocardial
  heart attacks could be prevented by these modifiable factors, which are influenced
  by the diet. The diet followed is responsible, to a greater or lesser extent, for
  atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is an oxidative, inflammatory, and thrombotic disease
  characterized by the deposition of lipid and other bloodborne material within the
  arterial wall of almost all vascular territories, which is the prelude to atheroma
  emergence.


  The connection between high levels of LDL oxidation and the increase in cardiovascular
  disease risk and an early event in atherosclerosis has already been described. Several
  studies interconnect certain foodstuffs and the oxidation process of LDL, so that
  it seems that diet and cardiovascular disease are strongly linked. Indeed, at present,
  diet is considered an important determinant in the prevention of cardiovascular
  diseases. In this way, triterpenes may play a key role in decreasing this LDL oxidation
  and, hence, in decreasing cardiovascular disease incidence. Oxidation of LDL may
  play a critical role in the early stages of the disease, whereas thrombosis acts
  at the latest stages, it being one of the fatal clinic consequences of this pathology.
  Apart from preventing LDL oxidation, these compounds have been described as antiatherogenic,
  because of the role that the triterpenic diols, uvaol and erythrodiol, play in preventing
  LDL-supporting thrombin generation in vitro. Table 1 shows triterpene actions in
  the different stages of the development of cardiovascular disease.


  Table 1. Bioactive Properties of the Main Triterpenes Found in Olives, Olive Tree
  Leaves, and Virgin Olive Oil in Cardiovascular Disease


  Oleanolic acid was described as playing a protection role against LDL oxidation
  like other triterpenes with the effect of chiosmastic gum, the most effective protecting
  human LDL oxidation yet known. Thus, oleanolic acid exerts potent antiatherogenic
  effects independent of plasma lipid levels in apolipoprotein E knockout mice. Previous
  studies of isolated oleanolic acid describe its action in preventing hypertension
  and hyperlipidaemia in Dahl salt-sensitive  rats with genetic hypertension. In this
  study, oleanolic acid is described as preventing the development of severe hypertension
  through its potent diureticnatriureticsaluretic activity, its direct cardiac effect,
  and its antihyperlipidemic, antioxidant, and hypoglycemic effects on DSS rats. Other
  authors show its possible action in inhibiting the progress of fibrosis and in decreasing
  the portal pressure in CCl4-induced portal hypertensive rats, which could be related
  to the increase of eNOS expression and enhancement of nitric oxide  level in the
  liver. This prevention of hypertension has also been attributed to the antioxidant
  and nitric oxide releasing action of oleanolic acid. Indeed, Rodrguez-Rodrguez et
  al. showed how oleanolic acid together with erythrodiol was able to promote vasorelaxation
  in aortic rings with endothelium precontracted in rats. This effect seemed to be
  mainly mediated by endothelial production of NO. Later, this effect was studied,
  and oleanolic acid was shown to activate endothelium-dependent release of NO and
  to decrease smooth muscle cell calcium followed by relaxation. This oleanolic acid-evoked
  endothelium-derived NO release was independent of endothelial cell calcium and involved
  phosphoinositide-3-kinase-dependent phosphorylation of Akt-Ser followed by phosphorylation
  of eNOS-Ser.


  Oleanolic acid is also involved in atherosclerosis protection also, with antihyperlipidemic
  effects in Wistar rats, decreasing hepatic expression levels of lipogenic genes,
  and several cytochrome P450 genes.


  Maslinic acid strongly inhibits in vitro LDL oxidation. However, maslinic acid showed
  both pro- and antithrombotic effects depending on the concentration used. Thus,
  special attention has to be paid to the concentration of these compounds employed,
  because depending on that, the effects could change, which has been already described
  above. Another cardioprotective activity described for maslinic acid was its effect
  on isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarcted albino Wistar rats; maslinic acid
  reduced the effects of isoproterenol on body weight, heart weight, lipids, lipoproteins,
  lipid peroxidation, cardiac marker enzymes, and paraoxonase, so it that seems maslinic
  acid has cardioprotective effects, influencing more than one pathway.


  Consequently, maslinic acid may act both at the beginning and at the latest stage
  of atherosclerosis. Indeed, it has been described that this compound has been shown
  to be involved in atherosclerosis protection, with potential antioxidant and hypoglycemic
  effects by reducing insulin resistance in a mouse model of genetic type-2 diabetes.
  However, more studies are needed to evaluate the precise mechanism of action of
  these compounds in atherosclerosis prevention.


  The action of erythrodiol and uvaol in reducing cardiac hypertrophy and left ventricle
  remodeling induced by angiotensin II in mice, through diminishing fibrosis and myocite
  area, has been recently described. They seem to modulate growth and survival of
  cardiac myofibroblasts, and both of them inhibit the angiotensin II-induced proliferation
  in a PPAR--dependent manner, whereas at high doses they activate pathways of programmed
  cell death that are dependent on JNK and PPAR-.


  There are several studies on olive pomace oil, which has high triterpenic content,
  and on its improvement of the endothelial function, so it seems reasonable to conclude
  that these compounds could have an active role in cardiovascular prevention.


  In view of the actions described above, virgin olive oil triterpenes could have
  an interesting therapeutic potential as cardiovascular drugs, and furthermore they
  may fulfill a role in preventing, through diet, different kinds of cardiovascular
  disorders. Although more evidence will be necessary to identify the mechanism involved
  and their interactions, it will be necessary to determine the most effective dose
  and exposure time for treatments.


  A diversity of studies highlight different aspects of the function that triterpenes
  seem to play in cancer. So far, it is clear that triterpenes affect tumorigenesis
  and key factors for its development, such as angiogenesis. Apart from this, various
  studies note the antitumor activities of triterpenes in different cancers such as
  hepatocellular carcinoma, skin cancer, colon cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer,
  myelogenous leukemia, and pancreatic cancer.


  In this line, the antiangiogenic effects of oleanolic and maslinic acids in human
  liver cancer cell lines have been studied. In a dose-dependent manner they reduced
  cell invasion and migration, decreasing reactive oxygen species  and NO levels and
  decreasing expression of vascular endothelial growth factor. In Table 2 the kinds
  of action exerted by each triterpene in the different types of cancer studied are
  specified.


  Table 2. Bioactive Properties of the Main Triterpenes Found in Olives, Olive Tree
  Leaves, and Virgin Olive Oil in Cancer


  Several studies have focused on the antitumoral activity of these triterpenes in
  the synthesis of new molecules derived from them and assessed their roles as anticancer
  drugs.


  The mechanism of action of oleanolic acid has been studied in different types of
  cancer cells. On hepatocellular carcinoma, oleanolic acid exhibited inhibitory effects
  through induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Apoptosis was induced through
  the mitochondrial pathway, and this could be due to ROS generated by mitochondrial
  fatty acid oxidation. Wei et al. also described the arrest of cell cycle and induction
  of apoptosis in human pancreatic cancer cell line  by ROS-mediated mitochondrial
  depolarization and lysosomal membrane permeabilization. Apoptosis was also induced
  in several cancer cell lines, including multidrug resistance cancer cells, non-small-cell
  lung cancer cell lines, lung adenocarcinoma, B16F10 melanoma cells, breast cancer,
  and colon cancer by oleanolic acid. This compound activates caspase-3, decreases
  the expression of Bcl-2 antiapoptotic gene, and increases the expression of pro-apoptotic
  protein Bax. Along with this, oleanolic acid is capable of decreasing angiogenic
  VEGF and decreasing the development of melanoma-induced lung metastasis of the B16F10
  melanoma model in vivo. In osteosarcoma cells, oleanolic acid inhibits proliferation
  and colony formation, induces G1 arrest, and promotes apoptosis, through mTOR signaling,
  a central regulator of cell growth, proliferation, survival, and metabolism.


  Recent studies report the chemopreventive potential of maslinic acid in colorectal
  cancer in vitro and in vivo. This compound has not been as thoroughly studied as
  oleanolic acid in cancer, but there is increasing interest in the preventive action
  that it seems to possess. Hsum et al. studied the chemopreventive action that maslinic
  acid showed in Raji cells. It suppressed COX-2 expression and inhibited NF-B and
  AP-1 binding activities. Targeting pro-inflammatory pathways by dietary phytochemicals
  as a strategy for cancer prevention is one of the current issues studied, but at
  a later stage, inflammation and triterpene action will also be discussed.


  One aspect of cancer development is the metastatic potential of the tumor. Many
  authors have recently studied the antimetastatic activity of maslinic acid in DU145
  human prostate cancer cells and its mediation via hypoxia-inducible factor-1 signaling.
  In these cancer cells, maslinic acid acts by inhibiting uPAR, E-cadherin, VEGF,
  and matrix metalloproteases  expression and dramatically reduces the levels of HIF-1.
  Consequently, maslinic acid inhibits the migration, invasion, and adhesion of DU145
  prostate cancer cells. As oleanolic, this acid induces apoptosis in specific cancer
  cell lines. In some of them, maslinic acid promotes apoptosis by a mechanism similar
  to the one of oleanolic acid: a JNK-p53-dependent mechanism, the mitochondrial apoptotic
  pathway, the increase of expression of Bid and Bax, repression of Bcl-2, release
  of cytochrome c, and increase in caspase-9, -3, and -7 expression. Another potential
  antitumor activity of maslinic acid is its enhancement of the antitumor activity
  of TNF- by suppressing NF-B action and downstream gene expression, apart from activating
  the caspase-dependent apoptotic pathway.


  The two dialcohols of olive oil have been targeted for research in recent years.
  It was in 1976 when uvaol was first described to possess tumor inhibitory effects,
  along with ursolic acid and betulinic acid. Until 1994, there were not any additional
  studies on the effects of any of these compounds. Then, Es-Saady et al. described
  uvaol, ursolic acid, and oleanolic acid inhibition in leukemic cell line proliferation.


  Erythrodiol effects on skin tumor formation in mice were described in 1988, and
  until 2008, no author had described its cytotoxic effect. Since then, several works
  have described uvaol and erythrodiol antitumoral effects in murine and human cancer
  cell lines. The most remarkable effect of both is their pro-apoptotic potential,
  which they exert in two different ways: associated with ROS and by c-Jun N-terminal
  kinase JNK activation. Again, it seems clear that ROS are crucial in the mechanism
  of action of these four compounds.


  Inflammation is related to several diseases, for example, as a prelude for cancer
  development and interrelating different kinds of cells for the development of a
  response to a trauma or strange antigen.


  Virgin olive oil triterpenes have been recently studied for the modulation that
  they exert in the inflammatory response.


  Oleanolic acid has been described as an anti-inflammatory molecule in vivo and in
  vitro. This compound promotes an anti-inflammatory status inhibiting the activation
  of nuclear factor-B  and the production of tumor necrosis factor-  in human umbilical
  vein endothelial cells. The suppressive effect of triterpenes in the activation
  of NF-B seems to be extensive to the four triterpenes in different types of cells.
  It has been described that the efficient activation of NF-B-dependent genes by TNF-
  requires a cell to be in an oxidized redox state, suggesting that stimuli such as
  TNF may exert only a limited response if the cell is not in an appropriate redox
  equilibrium; thus, the link between ROS generation and activation of the NF-B pathway
  seems to be recognizable. Most studies focus on the role that triterpenes could
  play against certain diseases, their apoptotic role against tumor cells, or the
  protective action in vascular alteration, but a principal feature of these compounds
  is their antioxidant effect.


  The chemical antioxidant role of the triterpenic fraction of virgin olive oil is
  well documented, although the free radical scavenging activity is almost absent
  in oleanolic acid, uvaol, and erythrodiol. Maslinic acid also exhibited a weak antiradical
  activity up to 800 M and 2.50 mol ratio, but up to 5.00 mol a high DPPH scavenging
  activity was observed. It acts as an efficient peroxyl radical scavenger by the
  ORAC assay.


  Balanehru et al. described the protection offered by oleanolic acid, isolated from
  Eugenia jumbolana, against hepatic microsome lipid peroxidation in rats. Maslinic
  acid was described to prevent hepatocyte membrane from lipid peroxidation in rats,
  induced by the hydroxyl radical. According to this, some authors tried to study
  this prevention of lipid peroxidation in hepatic microsomes of rats that were fed,
  for 3 weeks, high-oleic-acid oils  containing different concentrations of the antioxidants
  -tocopherol, erythrodiol, and oleanolic acid. They concluded that oleanolic acid
  and erythrodiol protect against, at least partly, microsomal lipid peroxidation
  in rats fed olive pomace oil.


  Oxidative stress and inflammation are closely related, not only because of the NF-B
  pathway but also on account of other signals such as ROS and reactive nitrogen species  produced
  by macrophages and other mediated immune cells. With this signal, macrophages activate
  other immune cells that, with them, will try to mediate inflammation and revert
  to the initial health status. In this way, any compound that acts directly or indirectly
  in oxidative stress will act in inflammation and, thereby, in the prelude of several
  diseases.


  According to this, oleanolic acid has been one of the triterpenes most studied in
  inflammation and oxidative stress. This compound is an effective inhibitor of cyclo-oxygenase  and
  of 5-lipoxygenase, both present in the arachidonic acid synthesis pathway. The anti-inflammatory
  effects of suppressing COX-2 action, like the reduction of several pro-inflammatory
  cytokines such as IL-6, IL-1, and TNF-, are well-known.


  Other studies in PC12 cells show the influence of oleanolic acid in reducing subsequent
  H2O2\- or MMP+-induced cell death and lactate dehydrogenase  release, which leads
  to alleviated oxidative stress in PC12 cells H2O2\- or MMP+-induced injury. It spares
  GSH, raising the activity of SOD and catalase and reducing the release of IL-6 and
  TNF-. Another antioxidant effect of oleanolic acid was studied by Tsai et al. The
  study was undertaken in mouse brain, where, dose-dependently, oleanolic acid diminished
  ROS and proteins related with oxidative stress, showing neuroprotective effects
  in vivo.


  COX-2 and inducible nitric oxide synthethase  expression are suppressed at protein
  and mRNA levels by maslinic acid, and likewise in the translocation of NF-B to the
  nucleus, in a concentration-dependent manner in cultured cortical astrocytes. These
  last actions  are produced by maslinic acid in mouse macrophages and by the four
  triterpenic compounds of olive oil in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells.
  These authors observed that maslinic acid significantly inhibits the enhanced production
  of NO induced by lipopolysaccharide, measured by the nitrite production with an
  IC50 value of 25.4 M. This seems to be in correlation with an action in the iNOS
  gene expression rather than a direct inhibitory effect on the enzyme activity. ROS
  were reduced in a dose-dependent manner  showing a preventive effect in oxidative
  stress in murine macrophages. The inhibition of NO production by oleanolic and maslinic
  acid was described by Yang et al. in murine RAW 264.7 cells. In breast cancer cells
  ROS production was decreased by uvaol, oleanolic acid, and maslinic acid.


  Interestingly, triterpenes are capable of protecting against H2O2-induced DNA damage
  in several leukemic and human breast cancer cell lines. There are not many studies
  about antioxidant effects of triterpenes in DNA damage, but attending to the effects
  observed in different types of cells on oxidative stress, and with these previous
  studies in leukemic and breast cancer cell lines, probably these triterpenic acids
  and dialcohols play an important role in the oxidative stress mechanism of the cell,
  even at nucleus level, protecting against oxidative damage to DNA. Because of that,
  these olive oil triterpenes could be a good option for preventing different diseases
  related with oxidative stress, such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer, or even
  Parkinsons disease and Alzheimers disease.


  Another potentially interesting role of triterpenes is their predictable antioxidant
  capacity in aging. Aging is associated with the accumulation of inactive or less
  active forms of numerous enzymes. The possibility that these age-related changes
  are due, at least in part, to oxidative modification is indicated by Berlett et
  al. There is no scientific evidence of the action of these compounds in the oxidative
  modification of a protein, but they are modulators of the proteic activity in the
  cell and could protect against the loss of their activity or oxidative modification;
  additional studies are required to ensure this.


  Oleanolic acid, maslinic acid, uvaol, and erythrodiol are the main triterpenes found
  in virgin olive oil, but they are not present in other edible oils. They appear
  in olive leaves and olive skin, and their concentrations depend on the variety selected
  and the culture handling. These triterpenes possess antioxidant properties per se,
  and in different cellular types, they affect some central proteins of oxidative
  stress and inflammation ; it is still unknown what actual pathways they affect and
  how.


  Although the origins of the diseases described above are varied, oxidative stress
  is a common condition in them. Compounds that protect against oxidative stress may
  be useful to prevent these diseases. As we have already showed, triterpenes exert
  a protective role against oxidant environment, regulating it or, even more, diminishing
  it. Therefore, the main triterpenes of virgin olive oil could have a critical role
  in preventing a group of several diseases related with oxidative stress, such as
  cancer or cardiovascular disease.


  More bioavailability studies about these triterpenes are needed to obtain reliable
  information about the range in which they are present in the cellular metabolism.


  Taking into account all available scientific evidence, the beneficial effects of
  the major triterpenes present in virgin olive oil could prevent certain diseases.
  For all of these reasons, more studies on the mechanism of action of these triterpenes
  in oxidative stress are required; indeed, these studies could probe the potential
  role of triterpenes in preventing the appearance of different diseases.


  This study was financially supported by the Junta de Andaluca  and supported by
  grants from the University of Jan.
