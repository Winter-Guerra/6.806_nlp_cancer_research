  and its derivatives can improve bone health through decreased inflammation and oxidative
  stress in an animal.md

  Recently, nutritional and pharmaceutical benefits of pomegranate  have raised a
  growing scientific interest. Since PG is endowed with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant
  activities, we hypothesized that it may have beneficial effects on osteoporosis.


  We used ovariectomized  mice as a well-described model of postmenopausal osteoporosis
  to study the influence of PG consumption on bone health. Mice were divided into
  five groups as following: two control groups sham-operated and ovariectomized  mice
  fed a standard diet, versus three treated groups OVX mice given a modified diet
  from the AIN-93G diet, containing 5.7 % of PG lyophilized mashed totum, or 9.6 %
  of PG fresh juice  or 2.9 % of PG lyophilized mashed peel.


  As expected, ovariectomy was associated with a decreased femoral bone mineral density  and
  impaired bone micro-architecture parameters. Consumption of PGj, PGp, or PGt induced
  bone-sparing effects in those OVX mice, both on femoral BMD and bone micro-architecture
  parameters. In addition, PG  up-regulated osteoblast activity and decreased the
  expression of osteoclast markers, when compared to what was observed in OVX CT animals.
  Consistent with the data related to bone parameters, PG consumption elicited a lower
  expression of pro-inflammatory makers and of enzymes involved in ROS generation,
  whereas the expression of anti-inflammatory markers and anti-oxidant actors was
  enhanced.


  These results indicate that all PG parts are effective in preventing the development
  of bone loss induced by ovariectomy in mice. Such an effect could be partially explained
  by an improved inflammatory and oxidative status.


  Pomegranate Nutritional prevention Osteoporosis Animal model Inflammation Oxidative
  stress


  Pomegranate, one of the oldest known edible fruits, represents a phytochemical reservoir
  with a high-potential medicinal value. This fruit, grown mainly in the Mediterranean
  region, has been used for centuries to treat many ailments such as parasitic and
  microbial infections, ulcers, diarrhea, hemorrhage, and dysentery. This is why,
  over the past decade, the evaluation of nutritional and pharmaceutical benefits
  of pomegranate  has raised a great scientific interest with more than 600 publications
  now available on the subject.


  Pomegranate composition is very complex, and each part is built up with specific
  components. Indeed, the fruit can be divided in two parts:  the edible one, called
  the aril, comprising 78 % juice and 22 % seeds, which constitutes 52 % of the total
  fruit, and  the peel or pericarp, which is nonedible although it has been traditionally
  used in folk medicine. A large array of phytochemicals has been identified in those
  two parts of PG, including polyphenolic compounds such as anthocyanins  in the juice
  and hydrolysable tannins  in the peel. Actually, the main benefit of PG has been
  attributed to its unique polyphenols composition. Indeed, PG polyphenols have been
  shown to exhibit high anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory capacities interesting
  for the prevention of several age-related diseases. In this light, the health benefits
  of PG consumption in preventing cancers  and cardiovascular diseases  have been
  widely focused. However, only a few studies have targeted the eventual benefice
  of PG consumption toward bone health, although in the present context of longer
  life expectancy, the prevalence of osteoporosis has been considerably increased.
  As a matter of fact, with more than 50 % of women and 20 % of men affected in the
  US population over 50-year old, osteoporosis, the most common bone disease, represents
  a major economic and public health issue, and this is true worldwide. This condition
  is characterized by a slow decline of bone mass and impaired micro-architecture
  leading to increased bone susceptibility to fracture. Pathology establishment involves
  disruption of formation/resorption balance through uncoupling osteoblasts and osteoclasts
  activities. Besides, the literature has linked inflammation and oxidative status
  establishment with bone alteration, osteoclast bone resorption being promoted while
  osteoblast-mediated formation is inhibited.


  Along with drugs ensuring bone homeostasis strategies, recent nutritional approaches
  have been developed and have revealed major interests for phenolic compounds such
  as flavonoids, anthocyanins, and tannins derived from vegetables and drinks. In
  this context, we investigated the effect of PG consumption on bone status. So far,
  most of the studies targeting PG health benefits have been focused on juice or purified
  peel polyphenol extracts: ellagic acid, punicalagin, and anthocyanins. In our hand,
  we investigated the in vivo  potential benefits of PG, in the context of osteoporosis
  prevention through different nutritional approaches:  juice,  peel, and  whole fruit.
  The objective was to elucidate whether PG should be considered as one or as parts
  of new strategies to better contribute to bone health preservation.


  Pomegranates  were purchased from POMONA. Totum sample was prepared from the blended
  whole fruit  to obtain a homogenous mixture. Mashed peel was obtained following
  the same protocol as for the totum sample, separation of peel and arils being performed
  manually. Arils were squeezed, and juice was filtered through filter paper. PG totum,
  juice, and peel used in the present study were analyzed for protein, free sugars,
  insoluble fiber, and polyphenols, see Table 1.


  Totum and mashed peel were dried using a freeze drier. The yield of the lyophilized
  powder of the PG totum was 21.2 and 25.4 % from PG peel. All samples were frozen
  at 20 C, directly after preparation and until diet formulation.


  All the animal procedures were approved by the institutions animal welfare committee  and
  were conducted in accordance with the Europeans guidelines for the care and use
  of laboratory animals. The animals were housed in the animal facilities of the Human
  Nutrition Unit at INRA Research Center. Surgery was performed under anesthesia,
  and all efforts were made to minimize suffering.


  Fifty-eight-week-old female C57BL/6J mice were purchased from JANVIER. The animals
  were housed in a controlled environment, 1 mice per plastic cage fed ad libitum
  and with free access to water. After an acclimatization period of 1 week, they were
  randomly divided into 5 groups. Two groups were surgically ovariectomized, while
  the other animals were sham-operated, under anesthesia. The control mice  were fed
  with a standard diet, modified from the AIN-93G powdered diet. PG groups were fed
  with the same standard diet, containing different amounts of PG parts. As far as
  the totum group is concerned, 5.7 % of the PG lyophilized totum was added to the
  standard diet. With regards to the juice group, 9.6 % of the PG fresh juice was
  added and 2.9 % of the PG lyophilized mashed peel was introduced into the diet for
  the peel group. According to the human/mouse conversion principle, the experimental
  dose for PG juice  in the present study was set equivalent to the corresponding
  nutritional dose of 250 mL for a 70-kg human subject. Then, the diet content of
  totum and peel from PG  was calculated by considering the amount of fruit needed
  to achieve 550 L of juice. In this light, daily quantity of PG given to the animals
  represented 1.4 g/mice/day of fresh totum  or 622 g/mouse/day of fresh peel. Diets
  were purchased from SAFE.


  Body weight was measured every 2 days during the study period. Besides, body composition
  was assessed at the beginning and at the end of the study, using a QMR EchoMRI-900
  system, without any anesthesia or sedation. After the 30-day treatment was completed,
  blood was withdrawn under anesthesia and centrifuged. Serum was frozen at 80 C.
  Then, the mice were killed. Liver, spleen, and uterus were weighted. Femurs and
  tibias were harvested and stored at 80 C prior to investigation.


  After removing soft tissues, left femurs of the 14-week-old mice were placed in
  PBS buffer  with 10 % formaldehyde at 4 C for 1 week. Micro-architecture  was analyzed
  using X-ray radiation micro-CT. Pictures of 1,024  1,024 pixels were obtained at
  37 kV and 215 A. Bone morphological analysis was performed using an eXplore CT 120
  scanner. Acquisitions were processed with X-ray tube settings at 100 kV and 50 mA.


  For each experimental group, four sets of extractions were performed with two tibias
  pooled in each. Frozen bones were ground in liquid nitrogen to obtain a fine powder.
  Then, total RNA was extracted from either bone powder using TRIzol reagent, following
  the manufacturers instructions. RNA was converted to cDNA using the high-capacity
  cDNA reverse transcription kit. Resulting cDNA was used for TaqMan low-density arrays.
  Relative expression values were calculated using the comparative threshold cycle  according
  to Data Assist software ; 18 S, GAPDH, and actin served as housekeeping genes.


  Results are expressed as means with their standard error. All the data were analyzed
  using XLSTAT  using a two-way analysis of variance  to test for difference among
  groups. If the result was found to be significant, the fishers multiple comparison
  test was then used to determine specific difference between means.


  During the experimental period, mean body weight, as well as lean and fat mass,
  increased in all the experimental groups, which reflects the health of the animals.
  Furthermore, no significant difference was observed among groups, which means that
  neither castration  nor the different diets  have had an impact on weight change.
  Nevertheless, ovariectomy was associated with a significant decrease in uterine
  weight, in all the four OVX groups. This atrophy was not prevented by PG consumption.
  The fruit is thus devoid of any uterotrophic effect at this physiological level.

  under different diets. a Body weight and composition data. b Uterine weight data.
  Animals were fed a standard diet AIN-93  or the same standard diet modified from
  AIN-93, containing 5.7 % of PG lyophilized mashed totum, or 9.6 % of PG fresh juice  or
  2.9 % of PG lyophilized mashed peel  for 30 days. n = 10 per group. Values are presented

  The biological effect of ovariectomy and of the test systems has been studied was
  first investigated on bone morphological parameters, using micro-CT analysis. We
  thus confirmed the deleterious effect of ovariectomy on femoral bone mineral density,
  the animals in the OVX CT group having a lower BMD, when compared to what was measured
  in the SH CT mice.

  Pomegranate consumption was able to counter such an osteopenic process induced by
  estrogen deficiency, PGj, and PGp  ).


  Significant results were also observed on trabecular bone micro-architecture parameters
  of distal femur, as shown in Fig. 2b, c. As expected, ovariectomy significantly
  impaired bone micro-architecture, as shown by a decrease in trabecular number, bone
  volume, bone surface, and connectivity  in the OVX CT, as compared with the SH CT
  one. Moreover, a significant increase in trabecular separation  and in total porosity  was
  observed as well. Consistently with BMD data, PG was endowed with bone-sparing properties
  as its consumption partially prevented  all these micro-architectural deteriorations
  induced by OVX: BV/TV, TbN, Conn Dn, BS/TV, TbSP, and Po tot, when compared to what
  was measured in the OVX CT animals. With regards to PGj and PGp, only a trend toward
  improved biomarkers was observed, without reaching significant values.


  To investigate the potential molecular mechanisms involved in the bone-sparing effect
  of PG, we performed transcriptomic analyses on bone tissue samples harvested from
  treated mice, using Taqman low-density arrays. Due to the large amount of modulated
  genes, only results for the most important bone markers are presently given. Data
  from the OVX PG totum, juice, and peel groups were compared to those measured in
  the OVX CT animals. Consistently with data of bone phenotype, Fig. 3a indicates
  that ovariectomy  was associated with an up-regulation of two major osteoclastogenesis
  markers: the calcitonin receptor  for mature cells and the Fos for proliferating
  one. In this context, PG consumption, regardless of the part of the fruit which
  was given, significantly counteracted this effect, as demonstrated by the decreased
  expression of CTR and Fos in all the groups fed the PG diet. Furthermore, the expression
  of the major integrin synthesized by mature and active osteoclasts  was significantly
  decreased in all the animals. In the same way, the expression of key enzymes for
  osteoclast activity involved in collagen degradation such as metalloproteinase 2  was
  also significantly down-regulated in the OVX PG groups  as well as tartrate-resistant
  acid phosphatase  expression was lowered, but only in the OVX PGp group, thus reflecting
  the inhibition of both osteoclast maturity and activity by the different PG studied
  parts.

  conditions  or exposed to different parts of PG added in the diet : 5.7 % in the

  lyophilized mashed peel  for 30 days. Transcriptomic analysis of bone tissue mRNA
  levels was determined by Taqman low-density arrays. Results are presented as fold

  On another hand, while ovariectomy  decreased the expression of osteoblast markers,
  as shown in the Fig. 3b, TLDA analysis reveals that consumption of PG as the totum
  or as juice was associated with improved expression of a co-receptor implied in
  Wnt/-catenin, one of major osteoclast signaling pathway: LRP5. Nevertheless, the
  other major osteoblast differentiation markers that have presently been investigated
  were not modified by any of the studied diets.


  To further conclude on the bone protective effect of PG linked to its consumption,
  we investigated the impact of PGt, PGj, and PGp on major inflammation and oxidation
  markers known to exacerbate bone resorption. Accordingly, a transcriptomic analysis
  of targeted inflammatory and oxidation markers was performed on bone tissue samples
  using TLDA, as previously described.


  As expected, ovariectomy  enhanced the inflammatory context in bone environment
  when compared to sham-operated animals, as demonstrated by the increased expression
  of pro-inflammatory markers such as CCL2,while the expression of IL1-R2 and IL1-Rn,
  2 anti-inflammatory mediators, was reduced. In contrast, consumption of each part
  of PG, and of the entire fruit by OVX mice, was able to prevent the establishment
  of such an inflammatory status measured in the OVX CT animals given the control
  diet. This protection occurred mainly through a down-regulation of CCL2  and IL1-R1  and
  an up-regulation of IL1-R2  and IL1-Rn expression.


  Effect of PG consumption on inflammatory and oxidative status in femurs. a, b Expression
  profile analysis of inflammatory and oxidative stress markers in femurs harvested
  from SH or OVX mice raised either under control conditions  or exposed to different
  parts of PG added to their diet: 5.7 % of PG lyophilized mashed totum, or 9.6 %
  of PG fresh juice  or 2.9 % of PG lyophilized mashed peel  for 30 days. Transcriptomic
  analysis of bone tissue mRNA levels was performed by Taqman low-density arrays.
  Results are presented as fold change compared to what was meadured in the OVX CT
  group  and expressed as mean  SD. p &lt; 0.05. a Inflammation: CCL2 chemokine  ligand

  1 receptor 2, IL1-Rn interleukine 1 receptor antagonist. b Oxidative stress: catalase;
  GPx glutathione peroxidase, GSR glutathione reductase, NOS2 nitric oxide synthase
  2, NOX4 NADPH oxidase 4


  On another hand, consistently, ovariectomy led to the establishment of an oxidative
  stress in mice bones as shown in the Fig. 4b by an increase in enzymes implied in
  ROS generation, while expression of glutathione peroxidase: GPx and glutathione
  reductase: GSR  was down-regulated. Interestingly, consumption of PG, whatever the
  part, was able to enhance those bone anti-oxidant defenses in OVX mice. Indeed,
  an up-regulation of those antioxidant enzymes expression  was measured, while, in
  contrast, the expression of ROS producing enzymes was down-regulated: NOS2  and
  NOX4, further supporting the bone-sparing effect of PG.


  The present study demonstrates for the first time that PG ) consumption may contribute
  to bone health during aging. Actually, all PG parts were able to prevent bone loss
  in a well-characterized model of postmenopausal osteoporosis by modulating bone
  cells differentiation, as well as inflammatory and oxidative status in bone microenvironment.


  First of all, to validate our experimental model, we assessed the effect of ovariecctomy
  on bone health. As a matter of fact, in comparison with what was observed in the
  SH CT group, the OVX control animals  exhibited decreased femoral BMD values and
  altered bone micro-architecture, as indicated by a lower number of trabeculae, decreased
  bone volume, bone surface, and connectivity density, in addition to a higher trabecular
  spacing  and increased total porosity. This is highly relevant to the human situation
  after menopause and consistent with the previous data.


  With regards to the dietary intervention with PG and its derivatives, the present
  study carried out in OVX mice showed that consumption of any of the presently studied
  part of PG elicited a protective effect on both bone mass and bone micro-architecture,
  the two parameters mainly altered in osteoporosis. Actually, our results evidenced
  a greater potential of PG juice and peel in preventing BMD loss, while when given
  as a totum, PG better counteracted bone micro-architecture impairment. Accordingly,
  our data are consistent with those previously published by Mori-Okamoto et al.  showing
  that PG extracts from seed and juice exerted estrogen activities and improved bone
  parameters following ovariectomy. Nevertheless, in the present study and in contrast
  to the previous work, PG consumption  exhibited a bone sparing not only by modulating
  bone histological parameters but also through regulation of cellular processes,
  as well as by improving bone inflammatory and oxidative status.


  Actually, PG is known for its large amount of phytochemicals and for the specific
  polyphenolic composition of its different parts, including anthocyanins  and hydrolyzable
  tannins in the peel such as ellagic acid, punicalagin, and gallagic acid. Among
  the great variety of those chemicals, punicalagin and ellagic acid seem to be the
  two important components of PG. It was raised that such a unique polyphenols composition
  could explain the potential of the PG to prevent various chronic diseases associated
  with aging, through its high anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory capacities. In the
  present experiment, it appears that PG action could imply all its components: polyphenols,
  proteins, sugars, fibers, minerals, etc., although the relationship between the
  chemical constituents of PG and their pharmacologic effects is still not clear.
  Accordingly, it appears crucial to investigate, like in the present study, the benefits
  of the whole fruit, considering the interactions between the various compounds in
  the PG matrix that could be of great importance for the final result.


  Nevertheless, we demonstrated here that the juice or the peel exhibited a better
  action on BMD than the totum. This could be due to molecules common to both parts
  such as ellagic acid or punicalagin.


  As a matter of fact, when considering the PG totum, those molecules could be less
  concentrated in the whole fruit, explaining that PG totum did not significantly
  impact BMD, although a trend was observed. As BMD mainly depends on hydroxyapatite
  content, such a result would suggest a greater calcium apposition rate in the animals
  given PG either under the peel-enriched diet or the juice, leading to a higher BMD.
  This is actually consistent with the recent published work by both  showing that
  a PG juice extract could increase calcium bone content during gestation in mice,
  even though a peel extract or a mixture of both were devoid of any significant effect.


  Inversely, we demonstrated that the whole fruit had a greater impact on bone micro-architecture
  parameters than the juice or the peel alone. This could be explained by the molecules
  present in PG totum such as seed compounds  that we do not find in other parts of
  the fruit. As micro-architecture parameters mainly result from better bone remodeling
  and expansion of osteoblast pool, we could suggest that PG totum improved osteoblastogenesis,
  leading to an improved micro-architecture.


  To further investigate cellular mechanism linked to such a bone rescue, the expression
  of the main markers for osteoblast and osteoclast differentiation and activity was
  analyzed. As expected, the osteopenia process induced by ovariectomy was associated
  with a down-regulation of osteoblast differentiation markers and an increase in
  osteoclast ones. With regards to present dietary interventions, we demonstrated
  that each part of PG was able to counteract such a bone loss in OVX mice. Moreover,
  as inflammation and oxidative stress play a major role in bone remodeling by modulating
  bone resorption, the expression of major markers of those processes was investigated
  in bone tissues. In this light, our data dealing with the effect of ovariectomy
  control are consistent with previous publications. Indeed, we confirmed that ovariectomy
  enhanced inflammation and oxidative stress in bones with unbalanced expression of
  pro- and anti-inflammatory and oxidative stress markers. In this context, PG and
  its derivates were able to preserve this balance and consequently to prevent from
  excessive bone loss.


  Nevertheless, we must stay aware that this study presents some limitations. Biomechanical
  and histomorphometry analyses could strengthen our data. With regards to the expression
  analysis of major bone, oxidative stress, and inflammation markers, proteomic investigation
  would allow to confirm what was observed on gene expression thanks to TLDA assessment.


  In conclusion, those data suggest that PG may be used as an innovative alternative
  agent for the prevention of osteoporosis. However, further studies are now required
  to determine the detailed contribution of each nutrients, composing PG in mediating
  the observed bone-sparing effect, and to assess if those data, obtained in an animal
  model for the disease, can be extrapolated to the postmenopausal women. Nevertheless,
  further studies are required to fully determine the contribution of each PG parts
  properties on bone.
