  DIM selectively inhibits cancer stem cells.md
text: '


  Epidemiologic studies repeatedly have shown chemopreventive effects of cruciferous
  vegetables. Indole-3-carbinol  and its metabolite diindolylmethane  were identified
  in these plants as active ingredients and theirs anti-tumor activities were confirmed
  in multiple in vitro and in vivo experiments. Here, we demonstrate that DIM is a
  selective and potent inhibitor of cancer stem cells. In several cancer cell lines,
  DIM inhibited tumor sphere formation at the concentrations 30-300 times lower than
  concentrations required for growth inhibition of parental cells cultured as adherent
  culture. We also found that treatment with DIM overcomes chemoresistance of CSCs
  to cytotoxics, such as paclitaxel, doxorubicin, and SN-38. Pre-treatment of tumor
  spheres with DIM before implantation to mice significantly retarded the growth of
  primary tumors compared to tumors formed by untreated tumor spheres. The concentrations
  of DIM required to suppress CSCs formation are in the close range to those achievable
  in human plasma after oral dosing of the compound. Therefore, DIM can potentially
  be used in cancer patients, either alone, or in combinations with existing drugs.'
