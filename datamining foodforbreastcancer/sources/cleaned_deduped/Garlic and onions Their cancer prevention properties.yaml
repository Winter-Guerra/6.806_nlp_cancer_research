  The Allium genus includes garlic, onions, shallots, leeks, and chives. These vegetables
  are popular in cuisines worldwide and are valued for their potential medicinal properties.
  Epidemiologic studies, while limited in their abilities to assess Allium consumption,
  indicate some associations of Allium vegetable consumption with decreased risk of
  cancer, particularly cancers of the gastrointestinal tract. Limited intervention
  studies have been conducted to support these associations. The majority of supportive
  evidence on Allium vegetables cancer-preventive effects comes from mechanistic studies.
  These studies highlight potential mechanisms of individual sulfur-containing compounds
  and of various preparations and extracts of these vegetables, including decreased
  bioactivation of carcinogens, antimicrobial activities, and redox modification.
  Allium vegetables and their components have effects at each stage of carcinogenesis
  and affect many biologic processes that modify cancer risk. This review discusses
  the cancer-preventive effects of Allium vegetables, particularly garlic and onions,
  and their bioactive sulfur compounds and highlights research gaps. Cancer Prev Res;
