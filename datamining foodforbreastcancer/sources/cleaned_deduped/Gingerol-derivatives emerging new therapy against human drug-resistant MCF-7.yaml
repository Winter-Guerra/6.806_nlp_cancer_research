text: '


  Cancer chemotherapies have been improved dramatically over the last two decades.
  In the case of human breast cancer, the combination chemotherapeutic protocol, cyclophosphamide,
  doxorubicin, and 5-fluorouracil, is often used. Nevertheless, the clinical usefulness
  of CDF is limited by its remarkably low therapeutic window and frequent eruption
  of resistance. These limitations prompted our search for a more effective and safe
  drug candidate that may raise the therapeutic benefits for breast cancer patients.
  Gingerols wide therapeutic indices as well as their high efficacy in the suppression
  of carcinogenesis are well established. However, no thorough study to date has profiled
  their antibreast cancer activities in depth. Therefore, the aims of the present
  study are to evaluate the antibreast cancer activities of gingerols in comparison
  to CDF and to gain insight into the structure activity relationships  responsible
  for the observed effect using a breast cancer cell model, MCF-7. Our data revealed
  that 6-gingerol showed the highest anticancer potency that is superior to that of
  CDF with IC50 = 30.4 M. Guided by these results, semisynthetic modifications of
  6-gingerol have been carried out to characterize 6-gingerols SARs. The obtained
  results showed that the acquisition of free hydroxyl group in the aliphatic side
  chain of 6-gingerol is essential for the antibreast cancer activity. Likewise, the
  length of aliphatic side chain in 6-gingerol is optimum for its anticancer activity
  because any decrease in the side chain length resulted in a dramatic loss of anticancer
  activity. Additionally, allylation of phenolic group has shown antibreast cancer
  activity superior to that of 6-gingerol per se. Conversely, methylation or isoprenylation
  of phenolic group has led to a potential decrease in the anticancer activity, whereas
  loss of aromaticity resulted in a complete loss of 6-gingerols cytotoxic activity.
  Collectively, the present results would simplify drug design to allow safer and
  more effective antibreast cancer pharmaceuticals to be designed.


  Anticancer drug Cyclophosphamide Doxorubicin 5-fluorouracil CF-7 Breast cancer Gingerol
  Allyl 6-gingerol


  Forty-three years ago, the USA declared war on breast cancer with the passage of
  the National Cancer Act of 1971. Since that time, great progress has been made in
  fighting the disease, but we cannot yet declare victory. Although scientific discovery
  has given us new insights into breast cancer prevention, detection, and treatment,
  approximately 425,000 women around the world died from the disease in 2010. At this
  rate, 10.6 million women will die from breast cancer during the next 25 years.


  Current treatment modalities involve surgical cytoreduction or radiotherapy followed
  by chemotherapy treatment. The most common chemotherapeutic drugs used for breast
  cancer are doxorubicin  and the taxanes. These may be used in combination with certain
  other drugs, like 5-fluorouracil  and cyclophosphamide. Even though breast cancers
  respond to initial chemotherapy, more than half show drug resistance and recurrence.
  This frequent eruption of resistance to these agents poses a serious challenge to
  their efficacy in cancer management. Moreover, clinical usefulness of DOX is limited
  by its remarkably low therapeutic window. The latter profile triggers an endless
  series of myriad adverse reactions that can be life-threatening; including cardiotoxicity.
  These limitations direct toward the finding of more effective and safe drugs, which
  may raise the therapeutic benefits for breast cancer patients.


  Chemoprevention by plant-derived compounds has emerged as an accessible and promising
  approach to cancer control and management. Of the many phytochemicals displaying
  a wide array of biochemical and pharmacologic activities, gingerols were recently
  reported to be effective in the suppression of transformation, hyperproliferation,
  and inflammatory processes that initiate and promote carcinogenesis, as well as
  the later steps of carcinogenesis, angiogenesis and metastasis. Despite these several
  lines of evidence supporting the activity of gingerol derivatives against multiple
  human cancers, no thorough study to date has profiled their antibreast cancer activity
  in depth. Therefore, the current study aims to evaluate the potential antibreast
  cancer activity of isolated gingerol derivatives, 6-gingerol, 4-gingerol, 4-O-methyl-6-gingerol,
  and 1,2-dihydroxybisabola-3,10-diene, in comparison with standard regimen protocol,
  cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and 5-fluorouracil. Furthermore, this study pursues
  to delineate the relationships between structure elements of these gingerol derivatives
  and their antibreast cancer activities.


  Dulbeccos modified Eagles medium  was obtained from Gibco Laboratories. Nonessential
  amino acids  and fetal calf serum  were purchased from Hyclone. Penicillin and streptomycin
  were purchased from Amresco. All gingerols were previously either isolated or semisynthesized
  in the Pharmacognosy Department, Faculty of Pharmacy, Mansoura University, Mansoura,
  Egypt, and identified by spesctroscopic means as ultraviolet, infrared, mass spectrometry,
  and nuclear magnetic resonance. The purity of gingerols was assessed by different
  chromatographic and spectroscopic methods. Plates of 96 wells were purchased from
  Corning Costar.


  Human drug-resistant breast cancer cells, MCF-7 was purchased from American Type
  Culture Collection. MCF-7 cells were cultured in DMEM containing d-glucose, NaHCO3,
  supplemented with 10 % FCS, penicillin, and streptomycin  in an atmosphere of 5
  % CO2 and 95 % relative humidity at 37 C. Cells used in this study were between
  passages 50 and 62. The concentrations of the studied gingerols were in the range
  from 50 to 250 M. They were dissolved in 100 % dimethylsulfoxide, and then diluted
  for the final concentration in serum-free media. In all experiments, control cells
  were incubated with DMSO alone. The final concentration of DMSO was maintained at
  0.2 %. Cells were incubated with gingerols, CPA, DOX, 5-FU, or CDF for 24, 48, 72,
  and 96 h.


  Cytotoxicity was assessed by MTT assay according to the manufacturers recommendations.
  Experiments were repeated three times, and data represented as the mean  standard
  deviation. This assay relies on the ability of viable cells to reduce a yellow tetrazolium
  salt  metabolically to a purple formazan product. This reaction takes place when
  mitochondrial reductase enzymes are active. Cells were grown in 96-well plates.
  After incubation with the reagents, the medium was removed and the cells were treated
  with 20 L of MTT  for 3 h at 37 C. Subsequently, 100 L of DMSO were added, and the
  solubilized formazan product was spectrophotometrically quantified with the help
  of a microplate reader, Power Wave XS, at 540 nm.


  Data were presented as mean values  SD. Statistical comparisons between groups were
  performed by one-way analysis of variance  followed by post hoc Tukeys test. Value
  of p ; 0.05 was assumed as statistically significant.


  Among all tested compounds, 6-gingerol showed the highest anticancer activity as
  shown in Fig. 1a. Conversely, 4-gingerol, 4-O-methyl-6-gingerol, and 1,2-dihydroxybisabola-3,10-diene,
  proved to be inactive even at concentrations of up to 100 M.


  Effect of side chain length, methylation of aromatic OH group, or loss of aromaticity
  on the cytotoxic activity of isolated gingerols: a IC50 of the most potent gingerol
  derivative, 6-gingerol. b IC50 of 4-gingerol, which is shorter in side chain length
  than 6-gingerol. c IC50 of 4-O-methyl-6-gingerol that has a methylated aromatic
  OH group in 6-gingerol. d IC50 of 1,2-dihydroxybisabola-3,10-diene. These experiments
  have been done after 72 h incubation with different concentrations of isolated compounds,
  counted as percentage of untreated control, 0 M. Data shown are the mean  SD of
  three experiments. IC 50 50 % inhibitory concentration


  Moving over the molecular structure of the isolated derivatives, it was observed
  that the length of aliphatic side chain in 6-gingerol is optimum for its antibreast
  cancer activity. Any decrease in the side chain length causes a total loss of anticancer
  activity as depicted in Fig. 1b for 4-gingerol. Likewise, methylation of the phenolic
  group resulted in a substantial decrease in antibreast cancer activity as illustrated
  by 4-O-methyl-6-gingerol, which did not show 50 % inhibition of cell viability after
  72 h incubation at the used concentration range. Following this further, loss of
  aromaticity has a greater influence on the antibreast cancer activity of 6-gingerol.
  This is clearly manifested in 1,2-dihydroxybisabola-3,10-diene in which the cytotoxic
  activity has been dramatically diminished over the used concentration range.


  After having shown that 6-gingerol demonstrated a high ability to elicit antitumor
  activity against MCF-7, we next sought to dissect the structural elements responsible
  for the observed effect. Therefore, semisynthetic modifications of the parent, 6-gingerol,
  have been carried out to characterize its structureactivity relationship. It has
  been shown that only 4-O-allyl-6-gingerol derivative had a better antibreast cancer
  activity than that of 6-gingerol, whereas other derivatives exhibited a significant
  decrease or even a total loss of anticancer activity, indicating the importance
  of native functional groups in 6-gingerol for its antibreast cancer activity. By
  a deeper investigation, it was revealed that the prescence of free alcoholic group
  at position 5 in aliphatic side chain is the utmost important functional group required
  for 6-gingerol anticancer activity. This is evidently demonstrated in compound 5-O-methyl-6-gingerol
  where the blockage of the alcoholic group by methylation led to a significant decrease
  in 6-gingerol anticancer activity. Likewise, loss of the alcoholic group by dehydration
  as in compounds 6-shogaol as well as 4-O-prenyl-6-shogaol resulted in a greater
  decrease in the 6-gingerol anticancer activity.


  The importance of free alcoholic group at position 6 in aliphatic side chain in
  mediating 6-gingerol anticancer activity: a IC50 of 5-O-methyl-6-gingerol. b IC50
  of 6-shogaol that has no alcoholic group in side chain. c IC50 of 4-O-prenyl-6-shogaol.
  These experiments have been done after 72 h incubation with different concentrations
  of the tested compounds, counted as percentage of untreated control, 0 M. Data shown
  are the mean  SD of three experiments. IC 50 50 % inhibitory concentration


  In addition to the free alcoholic group in 6-gingerol, the free phenolic group was
  found to be of great importance because its blockage has led to a significant modulation
  of 6-gingerol anticancer activity. While allylation of phenolic hydroxyl group in
  6-gingerol was a successful structural modification with regard to its anticancer
  activity, the isoprenylation of the same position caused a dramatic decrease in
  6-gingerol anticancer activity as in 4-O-prenyl-6-gingerol. This is further supported
  by the observation that methylation of phenolic hydroxyl group in mono-5-O-methyl-6-gingerol
  to be dimethyl-6-gingerol decreased the anticancer activity significantly. However,
  the acetylation of 6-gingerol hydoxyl groups instead of methylation has increased
  its antibreast cancer activity 3.6-fold.


  Modulation of 6-gingerol anticancer activity by esterfication of free phenolic group:
  a IC50 of 4-O-allyl-6-gingerol. b IC50 of 4-O-prenyl-6-gingerol. c IC50 of 5,4-O-dimethyl-6-gingerol.
  d IC50 of 5,4-O-diacetyl-6-gingerol. These experiments have been done after 72 h
  incubation with different concentrations of the tested compounds, counted as percentage
  of untreated control, 0 M. Data shown are the mean  SD of three experiments. IC
  50 50 % inhibitory concentration


  In the light of aforementioned 6-gingerols SAR, we next sought to determine whether
  the length of aliphatic side chain plays a prominent role in the regulation of 6-gingerol
  anticancer activity. As shown in Fig. 4a, the cleavage of aliphatic side has led
  to a complete loss of 6-gingerol activity, as depicted in compound methyl zingerone.
  On the contrary, dimerization of 6-gingerol was surprising, as it has promoted the
  carcinogenesis of MCF-7 in a dose-dependent manner. One-way ANOVA was used to test
  for statistical differences in antibreast cancer effect at IC50 for each compound
  after 72 h incubation period, and the means were significantly different across
  the samples.

  compounds, counted as percentage of untreated control, 0 M. Data shown are the mean  SD
  of three experiments. IC 50 50 % inhibitory concentration

  shown are the mean  SD of three experiments


  Having such valuable SAR data on either 6-gingerols or its semisynthetic analouges
  in hand, facilitated an initiative work toward preclinical usefulness of gingerol
  derivatives by comparing their antibreast cancer activities to that of CDF regimen.
  Using this approach, doseresponse and time-course cytotoxicity of this regimen were
  initially carried out by MTT assay. Individually, the dose response of DOX, 5-FU,
  or CPA at either 24 or 48 h did not reached the IC50 at any tested concentrations.
  The dose response of DOX and 5-FU were more evident after 96 h  vs at 72 h. However,
  only 20 % cell death was observed with CPA on Day 4, despite the high concentration
  used. Co-administration of the three drugs did not produce an effect on Day 1; however,
  50 % of the cells had died on Days 2 through 3. Therefore, 72 h has been chosen
  as the optimal incubation period for the dose-viability response of all tested compounds,
  where 6-gingerol showed the highest anticancer potency that is superior to CDF,
  the classic reference cytotoxic regimen.

  control, 0 M. Data shown are the mean  SD of three experiments


  Viability of MCF-7 cells after single and combined administration of anticancer
  drugs: The viability of MCF-7 cells was examined for 4 days after treatment with
  CPA, DOX, 5-FU, with all three drugs at the above concentrations. Cell viability
  is expressed as a mean percentage of untreated control  SD of three independent
  experiments. p value &lt;0.05 for the difference in cell viability between the combined

  For many years, laboratories from all over the world have been working on finding
  effective therapies for breast cancer, a disease of the civilization. Despite the
  clinical success of several newly developed antibreast cancer drugs, some limitations
  remain, such as high peripheral neurotoxicity, complicated synthetic procedures,
  and drug resistance conferred by multidrug resistance transporters. Therefore, there
  has been a great interest in identifying novel antibreast cancer agents with new
  mode of actions and improved pharmacological profiles particularly with reduced
  toxicity. The renaissance of natural products as drug candidates was the theme of
  the recent research in cancer drug discovery and development and has been proved
  to be a reliable, effective, and safe approach. In the current study, we put forward
  a new concept pertaining to the use of 6-gingerol and its derivative, allyl 6-gingerol,
  as potential antibreast cancer agents.


  For years, much focus has been placed in the development and use of 6-gingerol,
  the major active ingredient from Zingiber officinale rhizomes, for the prevention
  and treatment of cancer. 6-gingerol was found to potentiate the antiproliferation
  activity of various chemotherapeutic agents. Furthermore, 6-gingerol was capable
  of inhibiting cellular proliferation and induction of apoptosis in human pancreatic
  duct cell-derived cancer, human hepatocarcinoma, human lung carcinoma, malignant
  glioma, cervical carcinoma, and prostate cancer cell lines. All of this seemingly
  overwhelming evidence has sculpted the concept of 6-gingerol as potential anticancer
  agent. To extend the knowledge of the antineoplastic role of 6-gingerol, the current
  study opens up a new horizon in cancer fighting by shedding the light on the ability
  of 6-gingerol to induce breast cancer cell death more efficiently than the standard
  regimen, CDF. Additionally, allyl-6-gingerol, a semisynthetic derivative of 6-gingerol,
  has shown an antibreast cancer activity superior to that of CDF or 6-gingerol per
  se. Given these properties, 6-gingerol and its allyl derivative represent promising
  antibreast cancer agents. This input has originated partly from the study showing
  that 6-gingerol inhibited the metastasis of MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells.
  In concordance, we observed potent anticancer activities of at least three gingerol-derived
  compounds against MCF-7. However, this study is the first to mention that although
  the basic chemical structures of gingerols are similar, the specific functional
  groups attached at a specific position, can impose remarkably different bioactivities
  to the resulting compounds. This phenomenon is exemplified here by reporting that
  allyl 6-gingerol, which is having an allyl group attached to the phenolic group,
  to be the most active compound to arrest the MCF-7 survival followed by 6-gingerol,
  diacetyl-6-gingerol, 4-O-prenyl-6-gingerol, 5-O-methyl-6-gingerol, and finally,
  dimethyl-6-gingerol. Moreover, the current study portrayed the causal relationship
  between structure and the activity among these gingerols showing that the acquisition
  of free hydroxyl group in the aliphatic side chain of gingerol molecule significantly
  enhanced the anticancer activity. Likewise, the length of aliphatic side chain in
  6-gingerol is optimum for the anticancer activity because any decrease in the side
  chain length resulted in a dramatic loss of anticancer activity. In addition, methylation
  or isoprenylation of phenolic group, led to a potential decrease in the anticancer
  activity. Furthermore, loss of aromaticity, resulted in a complete loss of the cytotoxic
  activity.


  Several mechanisms have been proposed regarding gingerols anticancer activities.
  One such mechanism refers to their antioxidant activities, as most of gingerols
  exhibit antioxidant activities, and recent analyses have held that evidence favors
  an efficacious role for cancer prevention by antioxidants. However, the antioxidative
  potential of gingerols does not rule out their beneficial effects through nonantioxidative
  properties. For the proof of principle, 6-gingerol in this study displayed an effective
  antibreast cancer activity without being the most potent antioxidant in ginger constituents.
  These findings together with the observation that dimerization of 6-gingerol promoted
  the carcinogenesis of MCF-7, have strengthened the notion that multiple mechanisms
  appear to be involved in 6-gingerol action beyond its antioxidant properties. These
  mechanisms have been suggested to be related to Ca2+ and protein kinase C - involved
  interaction of ER and mitochondria stresses, protein degradation, beta-catenin,
  and GSK-3beta pathways. These effects are demonstrably nonantioxidative, which need
  further investigation to find out which is down to 6-gingerols antibreast cancer
  activity.


  An important and as yet unmet goal in the treatment of breast cancer is to develop
  an effective antitumor agent with minimized metabolic adverse effect that characterizes
  the existing medications. Considering the risk of emesis that is associated with
  breast cancer therapy, 6-gingerol has shown beneficial effect in reducing nausea
  and vomiting due to the inhibition of cholinergic M3 receptors and serotonergic
  5-HT3 receptors. These multiple effects of 6-gingerol envision its future clinical
  amalgamation with existing and promising treatments. Nevertheless, few side effects
  may have been associated with 6-gingerol, such as decreased melanogenesis  as well
  as its hypotensive and cardio-suppressant effects. These raise theoretical concerns
  that cases with cardiovascular diseases or those taking skin whitening drugs may
  consider using gingerol derivatives cautiously.


  In conclusion, with the continuing need for novel drug-like leading compounds against
  the breast cancer, the remarkable anticancer activity of the studied gingerol derivatives
  compared with the standard therapeutic regimen makes them potential leads for future
  antibreast cancer agents.
