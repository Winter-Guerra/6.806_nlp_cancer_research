  stress in rice Redox consequences and regulation by iron.md
text: '


  Arsenic  contamination is a serious hazard to human health and agriculture. It has
  emerged as an important threat for rice cultivation mainly in South Asian countries.
  In this study, we investigated the effect of iron  supplementation on arsenic  induced
  oxidative stress responses in rice. Rice seedlings treated with AsV for 24 and 48
  h in presence or absence of 2.5 mM Fe after which the root and shoot tissues were
  harvested for analysis. The results indicate significant  reduction in root and
  shoot length/dry biomass. Supplementation of Fe showed improved growth responses
  under stress as compared to AsV alone. The scanning electron microscopy  analysis
  of roots under AsV treatment for 48 h showed major alterations in root structure
  and integrity, although no noticeable changes were observed in Fe - supplemented
  seedlings. Significantly high  accumulation of AsV was observed in root and shoot
  after 24 and 48 h of stress. However, under Fe - supplementation As accumulation
  in root and shoot were considerably low after 24 and 48 h of AsV treatment. The
  hydrogen peroxide  and malondialdehyde  content in both root and shoot increased
  significantly  after 24 and 48 h of AsV treatment. In Fe - supplemented seedlings,
  the levels of H2O2 and MDA were considerably low as compared to AsV alone. Ascorbate  and
  glutathione  levels also increased significantly  under AsV stress as compared to
  control and Fe-supplemented seedlings. Activities of catalase  and superoxide dismutase  were
  significantly  high after 24 and 48 h of AsV treatment as compared to Fe-supplemented
  seedlings. The gene expression analysis revealed up-regulation of metallothionein  and
  nodulin 26-like intrinsic protein  genes after 5d of As treatment, while their expressions
  were repressed under Fe-supplementation. Our results indicate that Fe regulates
  oxidative stress and promotes growth under As stress.'
