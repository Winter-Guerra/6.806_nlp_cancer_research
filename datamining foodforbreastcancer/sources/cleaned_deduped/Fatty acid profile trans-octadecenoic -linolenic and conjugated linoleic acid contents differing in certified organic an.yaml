  Development of dairy organic probiotic fermented products is of great interest as
  they associate ecological practices and benefits of probiotic bacteria. As organic
  management practices of cow milk production allow modification of the fatty acid
  composition of milk, we studied the influence of the type of milk on some characteristics
  of fermented milks, such as acidification kinetics, bacterial counts and fatty acid
  content. Conventional and organic probiotic fermented milks were produced using
  Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis HN019 in co-culture with Streptococcus thermophilus
  TA040 and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus LB340. The use of organic
  milk led to a higher acidification rate and cultivability of Lactobacillus bulgaricus.
  Fatty acids profile of organic fermented milks showed higher amounts of trans-octadecenoic
  acid  and polyunsaturated fatty acids, including cis-9 trans-11, C18:2 conjugated
  linoleic, and -linolenic acids, as compared to conventional fermented milks. These
  higher levels were the result of both initial percentage in the milk and increase
  during acidification, with no further modification during storage. Finally, use
  of bifidobacteria slightly increased CLA relative content in the conventional fermented
  milks, after 7 days of storage at 4 C, whereas no difference was seen in organic
  fermented milks.'
