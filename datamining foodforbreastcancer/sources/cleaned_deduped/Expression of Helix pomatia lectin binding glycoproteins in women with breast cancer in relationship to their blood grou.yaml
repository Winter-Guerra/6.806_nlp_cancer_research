  of Helix pomatia lectin binding glycoproteins in women with breast cancer in relationship
  to their blood grou.md

  Aberrant glycosylation occurs in essentially all types of human cancers. A difference
  in glycopattern of proteins will result in a change of function of the proteins.
  The lectin from Helix pomatia  recognizes N-acetylgalactosaminylated glycoproteins
  and very consistent results over the increased binding of HPA in tissue sections
  are associated with metastasis progression and poor patient prognosis in a range
  of human adenocarcinomas. The induced modification of protein function after changed
  glycosylation is unknown, and as a part in characterizing the glycoproteins carrying
  the specific carbohydrates, we analyzed the major HPA binding proteins in sera from
  healthy women, women with primary breast cancer with no metastasis, and women with
  metastasizing breast cancer  using lectin affinity chromatography and lectin blotting.
  The binding ligands were further identified using mass spectrometry  to confirm
  the captured glycoproteins. The major HPA binding proteins in serum were found to
  be IgA1, complement factor C3, von Willebrand factor, alpha-2-macroglobulin and
  IgM. This set of antigens is a panel of candidates for useful HPA related biomarkers
  in sera, but our results also emphasize the fact that the blood group phenotypes
  are of most importance when using the lectin HPA in recognition of cancer biomarkers
  in sera and plasma. The results emphasize that interpretation of an individual change
  in the glycosylation pattern of a specific tumor marker always needs to be analyzed
  in its right context. This study shows that the blood group phenotypes can have
  a major impact on the results when analyzing HPA lectin binding.

  Glycosylation is one of the most common post-translational modifications of proteins
  and approximately 50% of all plasma proteins are glycosylated. The modification
  affects the folding, stability and biological function of the proteins. It has even
  been suggested that glycosylation could block phosphorylation and thus be directly
  involved in activation and regulation of signaling pathways. The lectin from Helix
  pomatia  recognizes N- acetylgalactosaminylated glycoproteins and has on several
  occasions been reported to be associated with metastasis behavior and bad prognosis
  of breast cancer, melanoma and other carcinomas.


  For several years, oncologists have sought to identify serum markers that would
  reveal the presence of specific cancers to be used for prognosis, monitoring drug
  effects and defining treatment options. In consequence of the high complexity and
  the high dynamic range in sera, efforts are made to remove high-abundance proteins
  like albumin and immunoglobulins, which are 10 orders of magnitude greater than
  the low-abundance proteins. The depletion of high-abundance proteins can be made
  using adsorption of immobilized dyes, immunoaffinity extraction  or with commercial
  antibody based kits. Another approach has been the enrichment of certain glycoproteins
  using lectin affinity chromatography.


  In this study, serum from healthy women, women with breast cancer, bcmet and bcmet+,
  were characterized by the lectin HPA. Glycoproteins were detected either by using
  lectin-blotting or enriching by using lectin affinity chromatography and separated
  using one-dimensional gel electrophoresis  followed by identification using MALDI-TOF
  MS. The HPA recognizes a heterogeneous range of glycoconjugates, including, among
  others, glycoproteins bearing the Tn epitope  and blood group A antigens. Therefore,
  sera from most of the individuals with A and AB phenotype revealed a more intense
  staining pattern than individuals with O and B phenotype. As expected, the procedure
  showed differences between patients with different blood groups, stressing the facts
  that both secretor status and blood group is essential in the background information
  when screening for biomarkers. Far Western blot analysis of 1D-PAGE separated sera
  indicated differences between individual sera that were not possible to detect in
  the affinity purified material indicating a difference in sensitivity and/or specificity
  between the different methods. The intensity of staining between individual bands
  in far Western blot also indicated far Western blot to be more of a quantitative
  method for determination of HPA binding compared to the affinity procedure. The
  HPA affinity chromatography combined with 1D-PAGE followed by matrix-assisted laser
  desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry  increased the sensitivity
  of the screening, avoiding the presence of major serum proteins and easily identifying
  known glycoproteins in sera. Major bands in sera after HPA affinity chromatography
  appear to be IgA1, C3, alpha 2 macroglobulin, vWF and IgM.


  A total of 47 serum samples were collected from postmenopausal women under controlled
  conditions at the University Hospital in Lund. All samples were processed after
  collection for a maximum of 2 h prior to freezing at 80 C. The study was based on
  samples from 16 healthy women, 16 patients with bcmet, and 15 patient with bcmet+.
  The blood group phenotypes were known for all the women with breast cancer, but
  some of the healthy women did not know their blood group phenotype. The study was
  approved by the Lund University research ethics committee.


  The HPA-agarose, 100 L gel, was loaded into a Spin Filter column 0.22 M Cellulose
  Acetate  and equilibrated with 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 150 mM NaCl. Serum, 100
  L, was loaded to the column in a total volume of 0.5 mL for 2 h in 10 mM Tris-HCl,
  pH 8.0, and 150 mM NaCl and in the presence of 0.1% NP40, final concentration. The
  beads were centrifuged at 500g for 5 min and the unbound fraction was removed. The
  beads were washed 10 times with 0.5 mL of 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, and
  0.1% NP40. The beads were then mixed with 100 L of 0.1 M N-acetyl galactosamine
  in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 150 mM for 30 min to release glycoproteins adsorbed
  onto the beads. This step was repeated once. The eluted fractions were subjected
  to acetone precipitation; 800 L of ice-cold 100% acetone was added to the 200 L
  fraction, incubated on ice for 15 min, and centrifuged at 10 000g for 30 min. The
  supernatant was removed and the pellets were allowed to air-dry. The pellets were
  dissolved in 40 L of SDS-sample buffer pH 8.5  bromophenol blue).


  Whole sera was diluted 1/10 in distilled water and 5 L was mixed with 5 L 2 SDS-sample
  buffer and heated at 60 C for 10 min. The samples were allowed to cool and 5 L of
  0.5 M iodoacetamide was added. The samples were applied onto Criterion XT Precast
  Gel 412% Bis-Tris  and the separation was carried out using Criterion gel-apparatus  at
  200 V for 60 min using MOPS as running buffer.


  Twenty-five microliters of the enriched glycoprotein from sera were heated and iodoacetamide
  was added as above. The gel electrophoresis was performed using precasted 412% NuPAGE.
  Electrophoresis was carried out in an XCell Mini-cell apparatus  at 200 V for 40
  min using MOPS as running buffer. The gels were either stained with silver or transferred
  to PVDF membrane.


  After electrophoresis, the gel was soaked in blotting buffer  for 15 min and then
  transferred onto PVDF membrane  for 1 h at constant voltage of 30 V. The membrane
  was either stained with 0.1% R-350 Coomassie Brilliant Blue in 50% methanol for
  5 min and destained with 50% methanol, 10% acetic acid or incubated with biotin
  conjugated lectin.


  The membrane was blocked in 1% bovine serum albumin in TTBS  overnight at 4 C. The
  membrane was incubated with biotinylated HPA  in 1% BSA in TTBS for 3 h at room
  temperature. The membrane was then washed briefly twice and followed by 3  5 min
  washes in TTBS. The membrane was incubated with horseradish peroxidase -conjugated
  streptavidin  diluted 1:2000 in 1% BSA in TTBS for 1 h followed by two brief washes
  and 3  5 min washes. The membrane was developed using autoradiography film and the
  enhanced chemiluminescence  system.


  The bands of interest were cut out from the PVDF membrane which had been stained
  with Coomassie. The membrane pieces were washed with 0.5 mL of Milli-Q water for
  30 min followed by four washes of 0.5 mL of 40% acetonitrile  in 25 mM ammonium
  bicarbonate for 20 min each until the Coomassie stain was removed. Then, the membranes
  were washed with 0.5 mL of Milli-Q water for 30 min and blocked with 0.5% PVP-40
  in 100 mM acetic acid for 30 min at 37 C. The membranes were washed 5  0.5 mL Milli-Q
  followed by two washes with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate. Proteins were degraded into
  characteristic fragments with trypsin  in 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate overnight at
  37 C. Digestion was terminated by addition of 20 L of 2% trifluoroacetic acid, which
  also extracted the peptides from the membrane. After 2 h at room temperature, the
  peptides were purified from the digestion buffer using C18 Ziptips. Briefly, the
  solid phase was conditioned using 2  10 L 50% ACN, 0.1% TFA in Milli-Q water. The
  organic solvent was washed away by two washes of 10 L of 0.1% TFA. The samples were
  aspirated and dispensed 30 times followed by two washes of 0.1% TFA to remove salts
  and unbound material. The purified peptides were eluted directly onto the sample
  target  where 0.7 L of matrix, 2.5-dihydroxybenzoic acid  had been added. The MALDI-TOF
  MS instrument was a Bruker Reflex III instrument. The instrument was equipped with
  a delayed extraction ion source, utilizing a nitrogen laser at 337 nm and was operated
  in reflector mode at an accelerating voltage of 20 kV. A total of 160210 single
  shot spectra were accumulated from each sample. The XMASS 5.0 and MS Biotools software
  packages provided by the manufactures were used for data processing. Known auto
  proteolysis products from the trypsin were used for internal calibration.


  For protein identification, human protein sequences in the Swiss-Prot database were
  searched using the Mascot Software. Parameters specified in the search were taxa,
  Homo sapiens; missed cleavages, 1; peptide mass tolerance, 0.1 Da; fixed modification,
  carbamidomethyl ; variable modification, none.


  Sera, 0.5 L, from 16 healthy women, 16 bcmet+ and 15 bcmet were separated using
  1D-PAGE followed by far Western blot. The sera from different women with breast
  cancer and healthy women displayed marked differences in HPA-binding characteristics.
  Individual patterns seemed to correlate with patient ABO blood group, but individual
  differences were also seen for example H5, H9 and H10.


  Figure 1. Whole sera, from healthy women, bcmet+  and bcmet, separated by 1D-PAGE
  followed by HPA-staining. Phenotypes of blood group listed above the figure.


  Glycoproteins were enriched using lectin affinity chromatography from different
  blood groups phenotypes. The proteins were separated using 1D-PAGE and then transferred
  to PVDF membrane. The membrane was stained with Coomassie. The enriched glycoproteins
  pattern  showed high similarities between individuals with the same ABO blood group
  regardless of disease status. Blood group 0 and B had equal pattern which differed
  from the pattern of AB.


  Figure 2. Affinity chromatography enriched glycoproteins, separated by 1D-PAGE and
  transferred to PVDF membrane, from sera of different blood group phenotype. The
  protein pattern was visualized using Coomassie staining. Lanes 13, healthy women;
  lanes 45, bcmet+; and lanes 79, bcmet. Phenotypes of blood group listed above the
  figure.


  According to the blood group phenotypes, a selection was made using only women with
  blood group 0+ to reduce the pattern inconsequently of the blood group phenotype.
  Three serum samples from each group, healthy women, bcmet+ and bcmet, were applied
  to lectin affinity chromatography for enrichment of glycoproteins. After enrichment,
  proteins were separated using 1D-PAGE and stained with silver. A small fraction
  of the enriched glycoproteins equivalent to 5 L of serum were subjected to far Western
  blot staining with biotinylated-HPA. No remarkably differences were seen between
  women with breast cancer and healthy women neither in the protein pattern nor in
  the HPA-staining pattern.


  Figure 3. Affinity chromatography enriched glycoproteins separated by 1D-PAGE from
  sera of blood group O phenotype. The protein pattern was visualized by silver staining  and
  the glycoprotein pattern with HPA-staining. Lanes 13, healthy women; lanes 4 and
  5, bcmet+; and lanes 79, bcmet.


  The same experiment was also performed using only women with blood group A. The
  separated proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes and stained with Coomassie  and
  with biotinylated-HPA. Both the protein and the HPA-binding pattern were almost
  the same with minor differences seen; however, there was no discrepancy between
  the three groups.


  Figure 4. Affinity chromatography enriched glycoproteins, separated by 1D-PAGE and
  transferred to PVDF membrane, from sera of blood group A phenotype. The protein
  pattern was visualized using Coomassie staining  and the glycoprotein pattern with
  HPA-staining. Lanes 13, healthy women; lanes 4 and 5, bcmet+; and lanes 79, bcmet.


  Affinity chromatography enriched glycoproteins from women with blood group A were
  identified from the Coomassie stained PVDF membrane.


  Some of the sera  had an intense low molecular double band in the 50 kDa region.
  All those samples were from women with blood group A or AB. These bands could not
  be observed in the affinity enriched samples from the same women. In all sera tested
  in Figure 2, there is an increase in the number of bands compared to the far Western
  blot experiment,  indicating a larger sensitivity of the affinity technique compared
  to far Western blot. In a similar way, Figures 3 and 4 also show an increase in
  the number of HPA binding proteins with molecular weight above the IgA1 heavy chain.
  The weak stain of M1 in Figure 1 is partly repeated in Figure 4, but the variation
  in intensity of the far Western blot pattern in Figure 1 is partly lost in the pattern
  of the affinity purified glycoproteins.


  HPA has been extensively used in cancer research as an indication of poor patient
  prognosis. There are convincing data showing the correlation between the formation
  of lymph node metastasis and the binding of HPA in breast cancer. High binding of
  HPA reflects the increased expression of a heterogeneous range of O-linked N-acetylglucosamine  proteins
  including among others also the blood group A antigen and the Tn antigen, and is
  a consequence of changes in the expression range of glycotransferases or an elevated
  increase Golgi pH leading to a redistribution of the glycotransferases in the Golgi
  apparatus.


  In this study, we investigated the expression of HPA-binding proteins in sera from
  healthy women, bcmet and bcmet+. When whole sera were analyzed for HPA-binding by
  protein separation using 1D-PAGE followed by far Western blot, marked differences
  in HPA-binding pattern were obtained. The HPA-binding seemed to correlate with the
  ABO blood groups. The HPA-binding was more intensive for individuals with blood
  group A and AB, which reflects the fact that HPA apart from binding GalNAc also
  binds to the blood group A antigen. There were also interindividual differences
  for individuals belonging to the same blood group in the HPA-binding, irrespective
  of disease state. However, suppose that we at this stage had pooled our samples.
  Pooling of samples is a common procedure for reducing the time and costs of analysis.
  In this special case, the result would have been totally misleading, showing that
  women with breast cancer had a more intensive HPA-binding pattern compared to healthy
  women, as a consequence of the fact that HPA recognizes the blood group A antigen
  and the majority of the healthy group belonged to blood group O and the majority
  of the cases belonged to A and AB in the disease groups.


  The interindividual differences from sera from women with the same blood group were
  less pronounced after the glycoproteins had been enriched using HPA-affinity chromatography.
  Minor differences in the patterns were seen between the women, but no evident differences
  between the disease state and healthy women. This could be a consequence of the
  limited resolving power of protein separation using 1D-PAGE.


  However, a major difference was observed comparing the whole sera stained by biotinylated-HPA  and
  the enriched glycoproteins. The whole sera showed a larger variation in the HPA-staining
  between the different blood group phenotypes than the enriched glycoproteins did.
  An explanation could be that the affinity chromatography steps drastically reduce
  albumin level in the sample and that the more diluted glycoproteins are concentrated
  and the glycoproteins become more apparent on the 1D-PAGE. Some protein bands are
  seen on the blots with whole sera in the mass range of 3750 kDa  but are missing
  after the enrichment. This phenomenon could be explained by low binding to these
  antigens in solution or to a different binding specificity for the reagents, biotinylated-HPA
  versus HPA-agarose. The lectin has also more than one binding site and the avidity
  gain in multiple binding points to a narrow concentrated antigen band in the blot
  is advantageous compared to affinity for the antigen in solution.


  In this study, HPA-binding glycoproteins in sera were identified as IgA1, Alpha-2-macroglobulin,
  complement C3, ig mu heavy chain disease protein, Ig mu chain C region, von Willebrand
  factor, and serrotransferrin.


  IgA1 has been found to bind to HPA in breast cancer tissue. IgA has also been reported
  to be increased in breast carcinoma patients and the presence in tumor could be
  the result of local production or increased uptake. IgA1 was one of the dominating
  proteins found in the far Western blot, present in all sera of different ABO blood
  groups. In our experiment, there was no clear difference in the expression pattern
  of IgA1 HPA binding in sera from healthy women, bcmet, and bcmet+. However, there
  was a large individual difference in the far Western blot experiment of whole sera
  indicating quantitative differences.


  Since the bottom line is to find functional differences originating from differences
  in glycosylating pattern, it is not only important to hunt for differences, but
  also to map the Glycome. Our main task is to analyze proteins from the sera binding
  HPA and correlating the degree of metastasis and outcome of disease. There is a
  great potential of lectin affinity chromatography for the reduction of the complexity
  in sera. The lectin capture simultaneously concentrates classes of glycoproteins
  and eliminates some of the major blood protein, such as albumin. The resolution
  of 1D-PAGE is still too low to be able to detect enough differences in sera and
  a second dimension of separation is probably necessary to reveal suitable biomarkers.


  Our results emphasize the fact that the blood group phenotypes are of most importance
  when using the lectin HPA or the use of other blood group-recognizing lectins, Vicia
  villosa, Phaseolus lunatus  and Glycine max  recognizing blood group A-antigen,
  and Griffonia simplicifolia I agglutinin B4  and Ulex europaeus I  recognizing blood
  group B- and O-antigens, respectively) in the recognition of cancer biomarkers in
  sera and plasma. This is especially true when samples from different individuals
  are pooled and analyzed using the blood group-recognizing lectins. We believe that
  a more detailed mapping of all HPA binding proteins have a potential to reveal useful
  biomarkers for human adenocarcinomas.
