  Emerging evidence has indicated that alcohol consumption is an established risk
  factor for breast cancer. Deregulation of RNA polymerase III  transcription enhances
  cellular Pol III gene production, leading to an increase in translational capacity
  to promote cell transformation and tumor formation. We have reported that alcohol
  intake increases Pol III gene transcription to promote cell transformation and tumor
  formation in vitro and in vivo. Studies revealed that tumor suppressors, pRb, p53,
  PTEN and Maf1 repress the transcription of Pol III genes. BRCA1 is a tumor suppressor
  and its mutation is tightly related to breast cancer development. However, it is
  not clear whether BRCA1 expression affects alcohol-induced transcription of Pol
  III genes. At the present studies, we report that restoring BRCA1 in HCC 1937 cells,
  which is a BRCA1 deficient cell line, represses Pol III gene transcription. Expressing
  mutant or truncated BRCA1 in these cells does not affect the ability of repression
  on Pol III genes. Our analysis has demonstrated that alcohol induces Pol III gene
  transcription. More importantly, overexpression of BRCA1 in estrogen receptor positive  breast
  cancer cells  decreases the induction of tRNALeu and 5S rRNA genes by alcohol, whereas
  reduction of BRCA1 by its siRNA slightly increases the transcription of the class
  of genes. This suggests that BRCA1 is associated with alcohol-induced deregulation
  of Pol III genes. These studies for the first time demonstrate the role of BRCA1
  in induction of Pol III genes by alcohol and uncover a novel mechanism of alcohol-associated
  breast cancer.'
