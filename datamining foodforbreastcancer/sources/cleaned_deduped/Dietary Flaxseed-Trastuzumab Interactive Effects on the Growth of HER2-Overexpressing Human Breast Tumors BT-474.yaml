  Flaxseed-Trastuzumab Interactive Effects on the Growth of HER2-Overexpressing Human
  Breast Tumors BT-474.md
text: '


  Flaxseed  reduces breast tumorigenesis and human epidermal growth factor receptor
  2  expression in postmenopausal patients and animal models. The primary treatment
  for HER2-overexpressing tumors is trastuzumab. FS oil enhances TRAS effectiveness
  in athymic mice but the FS effect is unknown and was therefore determined. Athymic
  mice with established BT-474 tumors were fed the basal diet, or 10% FS diet, with
  or without TRAS  treatment for 5 wk. After 2 wk, TRAS and FS reduced tumor size
  with a trend for an FS  TRAS interaction; however, after 5 wk, only TRAS reduced
  tumor size and increased tumor apoptosis. FS did not further improve TRAS effect
  but increased overall survival. TRAS reduced signaling biomarkers, FS reduced phosphorylated-Akt1
  protein, and FS  TRAS interactions were seen for HER2 mRNA and phosphorylated-Akt1
  protein. FS, with and without TRAS, increased tumor n-3 PUFA levels and serum lignans
  indicating potential roles in the observed effect. In conclusion, TRAS reduces tumor
  growth by influencing HER2 signaling. Dietary FS has minimal tumor-reducing effect,
  does not interfere with TRAS action, but improves overall survival in athymic mice.'
