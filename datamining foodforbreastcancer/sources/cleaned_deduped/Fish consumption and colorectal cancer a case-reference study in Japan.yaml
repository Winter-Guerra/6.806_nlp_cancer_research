  consumption and colorectal cancer a case-reference study in Japan.md
text: '


  Several clinical studies have suggested that supplementation with fish oils can
  suppress the proliferation of colorectal mucosa and therefore inhibit the development
  of colorectal cancer. However, epidemiological evidence concerning fish consumption
  and risk is inconsistent and limited. To clarify the association between intake
  of fish and the likelihood of developing colorectal cancer, we conducted a large
  sample size casereference study with 928 cases of colon cancer, 622 of rectal cancer
  and 46 886 cancer-free outpatient references aged 4079 years. The data showed frequent
  raw/cooked fish intake to be associated with decreased odds ratio  0.68 with 95%
  confidence interval  0.470.99 for male colon cancer, especially for males aged over
  60 years, smokers and frequent meat eaters. A marginal decrease in the OR  was also
  detected for female rectal cancer, especially in the regular physical exercise subgroup.
  However, frequent dried/salted fish intake was found to be associated with increased
  OR in females younger than 60 years old and alcohol drinkers. Although there is
  some possible bias in epidemiological studies, the results suggest that frequent
  raw/cooked fish intake may decrease the risk while dried/salted fish, in contrast,
  may exert a detrimental effect.'
