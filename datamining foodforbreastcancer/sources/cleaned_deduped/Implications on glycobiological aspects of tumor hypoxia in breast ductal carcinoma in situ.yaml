  on glycobiological aspects of tumor hypoxia in breast ductal carcinoma in situ.md
text: '


  Breast carcinoma is one of the most common neoplasia and the first cause of women
  cancer related deaths worldwide. In the past few years with diagnostic increment,
  the number of patients diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in situ  increased considerably
  and opened up new ways in research and new dilemmas in diagnostic and clinical practice.
  This work aimed to evaluate differences in Galectin-1 and Galectin-3 expression
  and lectins ligands profile on DCIS cells in hypoxic microenvironment. Lectin histochemistry
  and immunohistochemistry were performed with Concanavalin A, Wheat Germ Agglutinin,
  Peanut Agglutinin and Ulex europaeus Agglutinin lectins and with anti-Galectin-1
  and anti-Galectin-3 antibodies. Lectin ligands were more recognized in hypoxic lesions
  by Concanavalin A, Wheat Germ Agglutinin  and Ulex europaeus Agglutinin, but not
  by Peanut Agglutinin  when compared to non-hypoxic. Galectin-1 was not observed
  in all cases analyzed on both groups, differing from Galectin-3 that was overexpressed
  on cytoplasm of DCIS hypoxic group in relation to control group. As far as we are
  concerned, this is the first paper that describes glycobiological alterations in
  breast cancer hypoxic environment in vivo that could be used to validate in vitro
  models on this aspect. Moreover, comedogenic/necrotic carcinomas were usually associated
  with poor-prognostic than others, and our results show that glycosylation may play
  an important role in this event.


  Breast carcinoma is one of the most common neoplasias and the first cause of women
  cancer related deaths worldwide. In the past few years with diagnostic increment,
  the number of patients diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in situ  increased considerably
  and opened up new ways in research and new dilemmas in diagnostic and clinical practice.


  Ducts in DCIS are markedly enlarged in the range of 360 m in diameter, but since
  the diffusion of oxygen from peri-ductal vessels is limited to 100180 m, cells in
  the center of DCIS are poorly oxygenated and become either necrotic or remain hypoxic
  but viable. Because of this, DCIS represents a great injury to study hypoxia events
  so that Bussolati and coworkers  proposed a new DCIS classification system based
  on their necrotic and hypoxia areas. This classification was shown highly reproducible
  in many different European cancer centers.


  The hypoxic response via hypoxia inducible factor  is recognized as one of the most
  important microenvironmental modulator, altering tumor behavior and influencing
  all tumors hallmarks, enabling tumors cells to acquire an aggressive phenotype and
  become resistant to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Hypoxia switches not only energetic
  metabolism to anaerobic pathway but also changes glucose destination, synthesis
  of sugar nucleotide transporters, and glycosyltransferase activity. These alterations
  in glycan cycle alters glycosylation pattern of tumor cells, changing the neoplastic
  cells behavior.


  Such glycosylation changes might be recognized by endogenous galectins, modulators
  of biological events, and by exogenous lectins capable of correlating these events
  with information concerning prognosis, diagnosis, and therapy response. In this
  sense, ConAConcanavalin A, UEA-IUlex europaeus Agglutinin, WGAWheat Germ Agglutinin,
  and PNAPeanut Agglutinin lectins receive highlights in the literature, since their
  ligands, glucose/mannose, l-fucose, sialic acid/N-acetyl-glucosamine, and d-galactose,
  respectively, present different expression profiles in cells under carcinogenic
  process.


  Some studies have shown that other glycobiological aspects are changed in tumor
  hypoxia such as Galectin-3  overexpression in melanoma cells on hypoxic environment  and
  Galectin-1  that represents a link between tumor immune privilege and hypoxia in
  Squamous-cells carcinoma. In this context, this work aimed to evaluate differences
  in Gal-1 and Gal-3 expression and ConA, WGA, UEA-I, and PNA ligands profile in hypoxic
  and non-hypoxic DCIS lesions.


  This retrospective study was performed with archival tissue biopsies from patients
  diagnosed with breast DCIS, between years 2002 and 2009, obtained at the University
  Hospital of Federal University of Pernambuco after approval by Health Sciences Centre
  Ethics Board. Clinical and pathological data from patients were obtained from medical
  file at Medical Assistance and Statistic Service of this institution. Lesions were
  considered hypoxic if presenting necrotic nuclei or more than 360 m diameter  and
  small lesions without necrotic areas was considered non-hypoxic. Considering that
  one biopsy frequently presents more than one lesion, the media of lesions analyzed
  were 80.


  Four-micrometer-thick sections of specimens were deparaffinized in xylene and dehydrated
  in graded alcohol. Slices were treated with 0.1 %  trypsin solution for 2 min at
  37 C followed by a 0.3 %  methanol-H2O2 solution for 30 min at 25 C and then incubated
  separately with 80 g/mL of Con A, PNA, WGA, and UEA-I lectins conjugated to horseradish
  peroxidase  for 2 h at 4 C. All solutions and washings were carried out using a
  10 mM phosphate buffer solution pH 7.2 containing 150 mM NaCl. Lectin binding inhibition
  assays were developed incubating the lectin with its corresponding specific sugars,
  sialic acid/N-acetyl-glucosamine for WGA, methyl--d-mannoside for Con A, l-fucose
  for UEA-I and d-galactose for PNA  prior to tissue incubation. Negative controls
  were performed replacing the lectin for PBS and positive controls with tissues previously
  known as positive for these lectins.


  Four-micrometer-thick sections of specimens, after xylene deparaffinization and
  graded alcohol hydration, were incubated in methanol-H2O2 solution  and with 10
  %  non-fat milk solution. Antigenic sites were thermally recovered in steamer with
  10 mM citrate buffer pH 6.0. Primary antibodies  were incubated for 2 h at 25 C,
  and immune detected with biotin-free polymer  was reveled with diaminobenzidine  and
  counterstained with Mayers haematoxylene. Negative controls were obtained replacing
  the primary antibody by non-immune serum, and positive controls were performed according
  to antibody manufacturer.


  All statistical analyzes were performed in GraphPad Prism version 4.0. Non-parametric
  data were evaluated by the Chi-square. Differences were considered statistically
  significant at p ; 0.05. All experiments were repeated at least three times to results
  consideration.


  Con A ligands  were more recognized in hypoxic group than non-hypoxic. Forty out
  44 hypoxic lesions were stained by ConA, and in non-hypoxic group this lectin was
  positive only in 25 lesions and negative in 15. The subcellular location of lectin
  staining was cytoplasmatic only or cytoplasmatic plus membrane in both groups. WGA
  recognized its ligands in 41 lesions of hypoxic group  and did not in three samples.
  On the other hand, the non-hypoxic group was positive only in 19 cases and negative
  in 21 lesions, revealing a higher recognition of its ligands in the hypoxic group.
  It was observed a difference in WGA cellular staining pattern; in hypoxic lesions
  this staining was mainly cytoplasmatic, differing from non-hypoxic group that shows
  membrane staining too.

  UEA-I recognized l-fucose residues mainly in hypoxic group, while in non-hypoxic
  group only 6 of 40 lesions were positive. PNA did not recognize differentially the
  two groups being positive in 21 lesions in hypoxic group  and 18 in non-hypoxic
  group. PNA and UEA-I staining pattern was cytoplasmatic, predominantly, in both
  groups. It was also observed that PNA negative lesions were all positive for WGA
  in hypoxic group, and this was not observed in non-hypoxic. After neuraminidase
  treatment, PNA negative samples of hypoxic group became positive in 60 % of them.
  Lectin histochemistry results were summarized on Fig. 2.


  Gal-1 expression was not detected in neoplastic cells of all cases analyzed on both
  groups, but tumor associated stromal cells were recognized by anti-gal-1. Trying
  to draw a difference between the groups hypoxic and non-hypoxic positive stromal
  cells were counted in six different random fields in the 40 objective, but no difference
  was found. On the other hand, Gal-3 was overexpressed  on cytoplasm of DCIS hypoxic
  group in relation to non-hypoxic.


  Quantitative and qualitative changes in cell glycoconjugates are highly significant
  in the development and progression of many neoplastic processes. In tumor cells,
  the content, accessibility, and/or expression of surface carbohydrates have been
  evaluated by lectin histochemistry. These processes are affected, directly or indirectly,
  by N\- and/or O-glycosylation of functional proteins or lipids. The characterization
  of this glycocode is, therefore, indispensable for the understanding of many biological
  processes.


  A few years ago, the role of hypoxia in glycan cycle started to be elucidated showing
  a different pattern of glycosylation. Our results reveal an overexpression of Con
  A ligands in DCIS hypoxic group. One hypothesis for this increase is the gain of
  mannose rich structures in some proteins selectively expressed in hypoxic environment
  such as carbonic anhydrase.


  In our results, we observed a positive relation between UEA-I ligands in DCIS and
  hypoxic areas in these lesions, and this could be related to the increased expression
  of difucosylated Lewis antigens by fucosyltransferase VII increased expression.


  Our results also showed that negative lesions to PNA were positive to WGA, since
  galactose  is usually a terminal residue which is frequently sialylated on cancer
  being hidden by this later sugar. This result was confirmed when negative sample
  became positive after neuraminidase treatment. These data are in agreement with
  Yin et al.  that showed an increased expression of sialic acid transporters accompanied
  with an enhanced incorporation of N-glycolylneuraminic acid as well as N-acetyl
  sialic acid in colon cancer cells under hypoxic conditions. In hypoxic group, WGA
  staining was more cytoplasmic and less membrane related; this change on sub-cell
  ligands expression provides important information, since membrane staining is usually
  more associated with N-glycosylation and cytoplasmic with O-glycosylation  suggesting
  a saccharide pattern change in this group of neoplastic cells.


  Knowing that Gal-1 is not commonly expressed in neoplastic cells of breast cancer,
  we hypothesized that this protein could be required by these cells or overexpressed
  in stromal cells in hypoxia environment. Our hypotheses were not validated by our
  experiments. Differently, Le et al.  observed Gal-1 positivity in samples of head
  and neck squamous cell carcinoma which was correlated to the immune privilege struck
  by the absence of CD3 antigen on stromal cells coupled with its on overexpression
  in neoplastic cells. We could not form such correlation since none of DCIS lesion
  was positive to Gal-1. We also try to observe an increase in stromal cells expression
  of Gal-1 on hypoxic microenvironment; however, this association also did not proved
  true.


  Gal-3 was overexpressed on hypoxic group like that observed on melanoma cell in
  a vitro hypoxic model. As Galectin-3 is frequently involved with protection against
  cell death, this molecule may play an important role in cancer survival and resistance
  to many therapy approaches on hypoxia microenvironment. In this sense, inhibition
  of Gal-3 represents a promising strategy to sensitize these cells to death.


  Our study shows that Gal-3 and ConA, UEA-I, and WGA ligands are overexpressed in
  hypoxic environment, and Gal-1 and PNA ligands are not. As far as we are concerned,
  this is the first paper to describe glycobiological alterations in breast cancer
  hypoxic environment in vivo that could be used to validate in vitro models that
  tries to modulate Gal-3 and others glycobiological aspects of breast cancer. Moreover,
  open new ways to use this data to correlate with patient prognostic, since comedogenic
  carcinomas, usually hypoxic because of central necrosis, were associated with poor-prognostic
  than others.
