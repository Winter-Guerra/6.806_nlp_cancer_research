  Treatment of human stomach cancer KATO III cells with hot-water extracts from adzuki
  beans led to their growth inhibition as well as apoptosis induction. There are morphological
  changes in the cultured cells treated with the extracts, by which DNA fragmentation
  characteristic of apoptosis was actualized both concentration- and time-dependently.
  In contrast, N-acetyl-L-cysteine suppressed such DNA fragmentation, implying that
  the extracts from adzuki beans might exert antitumorigenicity via active oxygen-induced
  apoptosis. In order to verify this hypothesis in animal experiment, the 40% ethanol
  fraction of hot-water extracts was examined for its preventive effect against benzopyrene-induced
  tumorigenesis in the forestomach of A/J mice, given as drinking water containing
  the above fraction at 0.5-2.0% levels. Consequently, forestomach cancer has turned
  out to be reduced by 36-62% in tumor weight relative to the control. These results
  suggest that the fraction of hot-water adzuki extracts may serve as a nutrapharmaceutical
  or functional food available for cancer prevention.'
