  of a phosphate fertilizer plant on the contamination of marine biota by heavy elements.md
text: "\n\nDue to their toxicity, persistence, and bioaccumulation, metals are important
  marine environment pollutants, especially in low renewal rate water such as the
  Mediterranean Sea, receiving a lot of untreated industrial waste. The impact of
  a phosphate fertilizer plant on the marine biota metal contamination was studied.
  Several types of organisms: crabs, mussels, patella and fish were collected from
  two areas of the Lebanese coast, one subjected to the impact of the plant and another
  away from it; samples were analyzed for Zn, U, Cr, V, Mn, Ni, Co, Cu, As, Cd and
  Pb by ICP-MS. Higher accumulation was in crabs, patella, and mussels. Fish accumulated
  principally Zn, Cu, and Cd; a difference was observed between species and tissues.
  Cytosol metal fractionation using size-exclusion LC-ICP-MS showed principally Pb,
  As, Co, and Mn in the low molecular weight fraction ; Cd, Zn, and Cu in the metallothionein
  fraction, and Ni in high molecular weight fraction.\n\nThe online version of this
  article  contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.\n\nThe
  very low renewal rate makes the Mediterranean Sea extremely sensitive to pollution.
  The decline of the Mediterranean threatens the health of many millions of people
  living on its shore and jeopardizes the long-term development of key economic sectors
  such as fishing and tourism. This fact has led to initiatives to help the countries
  of the southern and eastern Mediterranean reduce the waste released into the sea.
  The key issue is the assessment of the present contamination linked to waste discharges
  from plants located at the seacoast.\n\nHeavy metals are normal constituents of
  the marine environment at trace levels, but their concentrations have been continually
  increasing due to domestic, industrial, mining, and agricultural activities. Discharges
  of heavy metals into the marine environment can change both aquatic species diversity
  and ecosystems. Because of their persistence, toxicity, and bioaccumulation, heavy
  metals may cause a risk to human and global ecosystem. On the other hand, some aquatic
  organisms such as, in particular, fish but also seaweeds and molluscs can be used
  to assess heavy metal contamination in the marine environment, since they accumulate
  metals to concentrations many times higher than those present in water or sediment.
  Studies have shown that metals accumulate in various organs of fish at different
  levels. Heavy metals often accumulate to a higher concentration in the active metabolite
  parts such as the liver, gill, and kidney. In general, the accumulation of heavy
  metals in a tissue is mainly dependent from water pollution level, time of exposure,
  intrinsic factors, and other environmental factors. Mussels, crabs, and patella
  are excellent metal biomonitoring species available throughout the year with great
  affinity to pollution and important accumulation capacities. Thus, metal concentration
  in their tissues reflects environmental levels.\n\nA further insight into the toxicity,
  bioavailability, and environmental behavior of the metals can be obtained by the
  identification of the biomolecule targets involved in its metabolic pathways. Indeed,
  the total accumulation of a metal in aquatic organisms may be insufficient to predict
  its toxicity since its various accumulated chemical forms are not biologically equally
  active. For the toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics of metals, the cytosolic fraction
  was shown to be the most important  since it contains both the metal-detoxified
  compounds  and the metal proteins.\n\nIn the Mediterranean countries, most of the
  industries are located at the seaside due to the need for cooling and transportation.
  The Lebanese coastal marine zone is intensely affected by several sources of heavy
  metal contamination, which discharge directly in seawater without any pretreatment.
  The objective of this study was to probe, for the first time, the direct impact
  of a phosphate fertilizer plant on the contamination of edible aquatic resources
  by heavy metals. The accumulation of U, Cr, V, Mn, Ni, Co, Cu, As, Cd, and Pb was
  investigated in the gill, liver, and kidney of five common fish species, in crabs,
  mussels, and patella samples, in terms of total metal concentration and molecular
  mass fractionation.\n\nFive commonly consumed fish species Diplodus sargus, Oblada
  melanura, Pagellus erythrinus, Siganus rivulatus, and Redcoat squirrelfish ; crabs
  ; mussels ; and patella  were collected from two areas of the Lebanese coastal zone
  Selaata, an area subjected to the impact of a phosphate fertilizer plant and Jbeil,
  away from the direct industrial impact. The collected samples were transferred to
  the laboratory in an ice box, rinsed with deionized water, and kept frozen until
  dissection. All fish samples were dissected with sterile scissors to separate gills,
  liver, and kidney; muscles of crabs, mussels, and patella were removed for analysis.
  Tissues from individuals of the same species were pooled together, lyophilized,
  and stored  until analysis.\n\nAll the solutions were prepared with high-purity
  deionized water  obtained from a Milli-Q Elix 3 water purification system. All chemicals
  and reagents were of the highest grade available from each supplier. The hydrogen
  peroxide, H2O2, used was AnalaR NORMAPUR, HNO3 from Baker and the protein standards
  were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. A SPEX CertiPrep  PlasmaCAL mono-element standards
  of U, Th, Cr, V, Mn, Ni, Co, Cu, As, Cd, and Pb were used to prepare standard working
  solutions by diluting the stock solution of 1000 g.g1 of each element with 2 % nitric
  acid. DORM-2: Dogfish muscle certified reference material from the National Research
  Council of Canada was used.\n\nDigestions were performed using a DigiPREP device.
  One milliliter of hydrogen peroxide and 3 mL of conc. nitric acid were added to
  the weighed sample  in a PE tube of 50 m; the cap was tightened and the tube placed
  in the instrument at 65 C for 4 h. Digests were diluted to obtain a final concentration
  of 2 % HNO3 prior to total determination. Elemental analysis was conducted using
  an Agilent ICP-MS 7500ce, fitted with an octopole reaction-collision cell. The operating
  conditions are given in Table 1. Single-element standard stock solutions PlasmaCAL
  \ were used for the calibration. The method has been validated by the analysis of
  a DORM-2 material.\n\nThe cytosols were prepared from 50 mg of the gill, liver,
  and kidney tissues of the S. rivulatus species, diluted in 2 mL of 100 mM ammonium
  acetate buffer. The samples were sonicated with an ultrasonic probe. Metal determination
  was performed in the supernatant  after centrifugation  at 32,000g for 45 min at
  4 C. An Agilent 1100  liquid chromatography equipped with a binary HPLC pump, an
  autosampler, and a diode array detector were used. Detection was performed by ICP-MS
  with an Agilent ICP-MS 7500ce. A Superdex 200 HR size-exclusion column  with a mass
  separation range between 10 and 600 kDa was used at the operating conditions shown
  in Table 1. The column was calibrated with commercial solutions of thyroglobulin,
  ferritin, metallothionein, carbonic anhydrase, albumin, and Vit E/cobalamin. One
  hundred microliters of fish cytosol was injected and fractionated isocratically
  at 0.7 mL.min.1 of 100 mM ammonium acetate. UV absorbance was monitored at 280 nm.\n\nThe
  Selaata phosphate fertilizer plant is located at the coast 46 km north of Beirut.
  The fertilizers are derived from phosphate ores whichin addition to phosphate mineralscontain
  a wide range of metals such as Hg, Cd, As, Pb, Cu, Ni, Cr, and Zn. During the production
  process, part of the contaminants is transferred from ores to finished products:
  phosphoric acid and fertilizers. However, most of the contaminants are found in
  the effluents and mainly in the solid waste of the phosphate fertilizer industry,
  known as phosphogypsum. Due to weathering processes, piles of phosphogypsum disposed
  without any treatment may lead to chemical contamination of the surrounding environment.
  In this study, fish belonging to five commonly consumed species and patella were
  caught all around the industrial area while crabs and mussels were collected from
  both sides  of the factory.\n\nTrace metal in marine environment can be divided
  into two classes:  those essential for effective function of biochemical processes
  \ but toxic in excess and  those with no established biological functions and considered
  as toxic. The concentration levels of Pb, Ni, Cu, V, Cr, Cd, As, Zn, Mn, Co, and
  U in the liver, gill, and kidney of the investigated species were shown in Fig.
  1. Taking into consideration all the collected fish species from the two stations,
  the mean metal concentrations in the gill, liver, and kidney were, respectively,
  2.53, 1.52, and 0.87 mg.kg1 for V; 0.74, 0.88, and 1.04 mg.kg1 for Cr; 14.76, 5.36,
  and 4.86 mg.kg1 for Mn; 1.47, 2.76, and 1.77 mg.kg1 for Ni; 0.88, 1.03, and 0.58
  mg.kg1 for Co; 3.32, 35.96, and 4.24 mg.kg1 for Cu; 60.18, 164.15, and 109.67 mg.kg1
  for Zn; 4.85, 8.76, and 7.75 mg.kg1 for As; 3.18, 21.43, and 5.50 mg.kg1 for Cd;
  3.51, 1.44, and 1.08 mg.kg1 for Pb; and 0.34, 0.31, and 0.27 mg.kg1 for U. The overall
  metal accumulation capability of the studied fish organs decreases in the order
  liver &gt; gill &gt; kidney. Several previous studies approved that the liver is
  a target organ for metal accumulation and detoxification and can be considered as
  an important sample for the water pollution monitoring.\n\nAccumulation levels of
  a Zn, b Cu, c Mn, d Ni, e Cr, f Co, g Cd, h V, i As, j Pb, and k U in Diplodus sargus,
  Pagellus erythrinus, Siganus rivulatus, Oblada melanura, and Nylon \n\nThe mean
  concentrations of essential elements in fish organs follow the sequence: Zn &gt;
  Cu &gt; Mn &gt;&gt; Co and Zn &gt; Cu  Mn &gt; Co &gt; in Selaata and Jbeil, respectively.
  The concentrations of the toxic elements Cd, As, Pb, Ni, Cr, and U varied in a broad
  range between 0.3 mg.kg1 for U and 92.5 mg.kg1 for Cd in the fish organs. Concentrations
  of Ni and Cr are higher in fish collected from Selaata than from Jbeil showing a
  contamination of the area by the fertilizer plant.\n\nResults obtained for the molluscs
  are presented in Fig. 2. As for fish, the concentrations of the three essential
  elements Zn, Cu, and, Mn in the analyzed crabs, mussels, and patella samples were
  the highest among those in the studied elements. There are higher levels of Ni and
  Cr in the molluscs than in fish organs that were observed, especially in mussel
  samples. Related to other toxic elements, the highest levels of Cd obtained in mussels,
  crabs, and patella were 3.2, 9.7, and 5.3 mg.kg1 in Selaata. Similarly, as for fish
  organs, high accumulation of V and As was observed in both regions while the high
  level of lead 13.5 mg.kg1 was determined in mussels from Jbeil; this region away
  from the direct impact of the plant is surrounded by several other industries.\n\nAccumulation
  levels of Cu, Mn, Ni, Cr, Co, Cd, V, As, Pb, and U in molluscs; a crabs, b mussels,
  c patella\n\nIt is an essential trace element which becomes toxic in excessive amounts.
  Its concentrations in the studied fish organs varied between 44 and 360 mg.kg1 dry.
  In several studies, high accumulations of Zn were observed in fish organs, which
  is in agreement with our results as Zn was the most abundant metal in the studied
  organs of the fish. The lowest levels of Zn were observed in the gills even if for
  fish seawater is the main source of Zn, and some researchers indicated that gills
  are an important organ of its accumulation. The levels found in this study in gills
  of D. sargus and S. rivulatus were several times lower than in the previous report
  of Uysal and Emre 2011, and high levels were observed in the liver organ; in fact,
  it was also reported that when the levels of Zn exceeded the requirement in the
  gills, the excess was excreted by the liver, which is considered a detoxification
  organ. In this study, high accumulation of Zn was observed in the liver of S. rivulatus
  and Nylon and in the kidney of D. sargus collected from Selaata industrial area
  compared to that from the area of Jbeil highlighting the impact of the phosphate
  industry. No effect of the sampling location was observed for organs of O. melanura
  and P. erythrinus, although the concentrations found in the last species were slightly
  higher than in Turkish coastal water. In fact, in addition to the water pollution
  level, metal concentrations are strongly dependent on fish species and other environmental
  factors. Concentrations of Zn measured here in crabs, mussels, and patella were
  higher than those found in other areas ; Zn in patella samples were higher in our
  study even than in the contaminated area in Cravo studies, which is an indicative
  of environmental pollution from industrial sources.\n\nHeavy metal concentrations
  \ found in the liver of Pagellus erythrinus  \n\nHeavy metal concentrations  found
  in the gill of Siganus rivulatus and Diplodus sargus  \n\nHeavy metal concentrations
  \ in marine organisms from different countries  \n\nThis essential element assuring
  healthy metabolism and growth of marine organisms becomes highly toxic at concentrations
  higher than the levels required for growth. In this study, the concentrations of
  Cu in liver tissues were significantly higher than in the gill and kidney; data
  obtained by previous studies show that even at low levels, Cu show a distinct affinity
  to the liver organ. However, the enrichment related to possible industrial contamination
  was observed for one species only: S. rivulatus with Cu values of 179 and 46 mg.kg1
  for Selaata and Jbeil, respectively. The values reported for P. erythrinus liver
  were in the same range as those cited by  for the species sampled in Turkish coastal
  water. The levels of copper found in the gill were the same or slightly higher than
  those reported by   for D. sargus and S. rivulatus, respectively. Cu in crabs and
  mussels from Selaata were higher than those found in other areas such as Kuwait
  bay, Adriatic Sea, and Venice lagoon, which is an indicative of environmental pollution
  from industrial sources.\n\nThe toxicity of this element is considered to be low.
  The fish organs contained between 0.7 and 26.6 mg.kg1 in the kidney of S. rivulatus
  in Selaata and in the gill of S. rivulatus in Jbeil, respectively. The privileged
  organ for Mn accumulation in fish was the gill. The Mn in crabs and mussels were
  significantly higher reaching for some locations more than 100 mg.kg1. The concentration
  of Mn found in the gill of S. rivulatus and D. sargus were slightly higher than
  those reported by Uysal and Emre 2011. The values reported for P. erythrinus liver
  were in the same range as those found for the species sampled in Turkish coastal
  water, which can be due to the fact that manganese levels in phosphogypsum are between
  3.5 and 20 mg.kg1, low compared to other metal concentrations.\n\nChronic Ni toxicity
  to marine organisms was recently evaluated and found to be strongly species dependent.
  Levels of Ni in fish organs were relatively low in comparison to those of other
  metals studied and ranged from 0.5 to 4.4 in Selaata and 1.1 to 5.1 mg.kg1 in Selaata
  and Jbeil, respectively. Similar levels were observed for crabs, patella, and mussels
  with the exception of mussels sampled in the south from the Selaata plant where
  the concentration as high as 18.4 mg.kg1 was found.\n\nToxicological impact can
  result both from the action of Cr  itself as an oxidizing agent and from Cr  which
  is capable to form complexes with various organic compounds and thus may inhibit
  several metalloenzyme systems. In the studied fish organs, concentrations of Cr
  were at the level of a few mg.kg1; the highest value  was obtained except for the
  liver of the Nylon sampled in Selaata. The same levels were present in crabs, mussels,
  and patella with the highest concentrations observed in the north of the Selaata
  plant. The content obtained in P. erythrinus liver was in agreement with that observed
  \ in Turkish coastal water.\n\nIt is generally considered to present no or very
  low toxicity. In this study, no significant differences were observed for Co levels
  in the Selaata and Jbeil sampling sites; the highest concentrations in fish organs
  and molluscs were at the same level: 3.7 mg.kg1 in the gill of S. rivulatus of Jbeil
  and 3.4 mg.kg1 in mussel from Selaata.\n\nIt is capable to produce chronic effects
  even at low levels. In the tissues, studied concentrations of Cd were generally
  below 10 mg.kg1 for both fish and molluscs with the exceptionally high values observed
  for S. rivulatus liver in Selaata  and in Jbeil. It was shown that the liver is
  the primary target for Cd accumulation; the levels in Selaata were generally higher
  than in Jbeil. Cadmium levels observed in the liver of P. erythrinus were significantly
  higher than those reported in previous works on the same species sampled in Turkish
  coastal areas ; it was reported in previous studies that cadmium is taken by to
  the gills and distributed throughout the body and accumulates in the liver for detoxification
  \ which may explain this difference, showing a contamination of the area by the
  plant. Cd, in patella, were higher in our study than in others studies, even than
  in contaminated area in Cravo studies.\n\nThe pH is an important modulator of V
  toxicity. No clear link was established between the sampling location and vanadium
  levels with the exception of the organs of D. sargus where the concentrations in
  Selaata were significantly higher than in Jbeil. On the basis of the obtained data,
  the accumulation of vanadium seems to be strongly species dependent for both fish
  and molluscs.\n\nToxicity of this trace element is highly species dependent; however,
  in marine biota, most of arsenic is known to be present in the form of harmless
  organic species such as arsenobetaine. Similar to vanadium, the accumulation of
  As was found strongly species dependent with no clear correlation with the sampling
  location. Out of the fish organs studied, the livers contained the highest levels
  of As up to 14.6 mg.kg1 in the liver of O. melanura from Jbeil. The concentrations
  found in molluscs were significantly higher reaching 44.8 mg.kg1 for crabs.\n\nIt
  is a non-essential element which causes toxic effects. Distribution of Pb was similar
  between the different organs of both P. erythrinus and O. melanura species, and
  a similar accumulation was observed in D. sargus species from both regions. The
  highest levels were generally observed in the gills, with the highest concentration
  of 10.2 mg.kg1 found in the gill of Nylon from Jbeil. Lead levels observed in the
  liver of P. erythrinus were at the same level as those reported in the work of Uluturhan
  and Kucuksezgin 2007 and Dural et al. 2010 for the same species sampled in Turkish
  coastal areas. Previous studies have reported low levels of Pb in seawater, and
  fish bioaccumulates Pb proportionally to its concentrations in seawater, or Pb concentrations
  in phosphogypsum are low compared to the levels of other metals, which may explain
  in our study the low levels of Pb compared to those of other metals in fish organs.\n\nUranium
  is a non-essential element, with documented chemical and radiological toxicity.
  The levels observed in both fish and molluscs were generally low  with no significant
  differences in the levels for the different organs and species studied. Levels of
  U in marine organisms from Selaata were higher than from Jbeil.\n\nWhen compared
  with other studies, the observed difference in distribution of the studied elements
  between organs of the different species in this study is in agreement with that
  in the previous studies on other fish species. Metal concentrations were strongly
  dependent on fish species which is reported to may be related to the differences
  in ecological needs, swimming behaviors, and the metabolic activities of the different
  species. Few studies exist on metal levels in the chosen fish species; based on
  the obtained data, the S. rivulatus species has almost the highest levels of Co,
  Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb, and U; D. sargus had the highest levels of V and Ni; Nylon had the
  highest levels of Cr; and the highest levels of As and Mn were observed in the O.
  melanura and P. erythrinus species, respectively. The concentrations were higher
  in crabs: levels of 2715, 167, 158, and 52 mg.kg1 were observed for Zn, Cu, Mn,
  and As, respectively. Accumulation in patella samples was lower; the highest concentration
  found was 841.5 mg.kg1 for Zn while U had the lowest level of 0.2 mg.kg1.\n\nThe
  comparison of data obtained for fish showed that metal concentrations varied between
  the sampling locations. For instance, significant Mn concentration was found in
  Jbeil, while those of Zn, Cu, and Cd were in Selaata. The highest metal concentrations
  in molluscs were generally found in Selaata, except for V, Ni, and Mn which were
  concentrated in Jbeil samples. The levels of heavy metals in patella collected from
  Jbeil and Selaata were comparable.\n\nIn general, the concentrations of metals in
  fish organs in Selaata were higher than those in Jbeil, which may be due to the
  impact of the phosphate fertilizer industry in this area. Phosphate loading activities
  and phosphogypsum storage are considered as the main sources of Zn, Cu, and Cd which
  can be leached to the surrounding environment. The high levels of some elements
  found in the species from Jbeil, such as Cd and Mn concentrations, may have anthropogenic
  origin. This area is highly populated with considerable agricultural and metallurgic
  industry activities.\n\nPearson test was performed to find the intercorrelation
  between the organs of the collected fish samples. The linear correlation between
  each pairs of organs based on the Pearson correlation factor   showed significant
  linear relations between the gill, liver, and kidney for V and Cd in Selaata sample,
  also between the liver and kidney for Cu and Cr  and between gillliver for U, As,
  and Pb. Few significant correlations between organs were observed in the fish species
  collected from Jbeil, mainly between the gill, liver, and kidney for As; gillkidney
  for U; and liverkidney for Pb.\n\nThe linear correlation between each pairs of elements
  based on the Pearson correlation factor  showed strong correlations between many
  elements in the three organs of fish samples collected from Selaata, especially
  in the liver. For instance, Zn correlates positively with Ni, Cu, Cd, and U with
  Pb while strong correlations were observed between Ni, Cu, Co, and Cd. These correlations
  are absent in the case of Jbeil which allows to attribute the origin of these metals
  to the phosphate plant.\n\nFor the assessment of toxicity, mobility, and bioavailability
  of the studied metals, their molecular size fractionation was investigated further
  to their total determination. The experiments were focused on the cytosolic fraction
  of the liver, gill, and kidney of the S. rivulatus, which contains the highest levels
  of metals. The species eluting from the size-exclusion column were divided into
  three metalligand pools:  high molecular weight fraction, from 12 to 22 min;  metallothionein-like
  protein fraction   in the range of 2230 min; and  lower molecular fraction   after
  30 min as shown in Fig. 3. Most of the metals were bound to several species, e.g.,
  Cd binds to different protein fractions, mainly to MTLP in the liver and gill and
  low molecular weight species in the kidney. Surprisingly, only a small fraction
  of the cytosolic Cu was bound to MTLP in the liver, kidney, and gill of the Siganus
  rivulatus from both Jbeil and Selaata. As showed in Fig. 3, Cu was preferably bound
  to the LMW fraction, which increased with the concentration of Cu in the liver samples
  of Siganus rivulatus from Selaata. This highlights a high contamination and healthy
  effect. Indeed, ecotoxicological studies have shown that MTLP are detoxifier proteins
  whereas HMW and LMW would be biomarkers of harmful effects.\n\nArsenic, cobalt,
  and lead were found predominantly in the low molecular fraction, whereas a significant
  fraction of nickel  was bound to high molecular proteins.\n\nData have shown a heavy
  contamination of marine biota directly related to the phosphate plant activity in
  Selaata, especially for Zn, Cu, and Cd which are contained in the coproduct and
  industrial waste of the factory. The contamination is species dependent. The highest
  metal concentrations were found in the livers  of the studied fish species. The
  concentrations of Zn in all organs were the highest. The metals were relatively
  homogenously distributed among the pools of biological ligands which suggest that
  the levels of contamination exceed those at which molecular mechanisms are still
  active.\n\nWe would like to thank the Lebanese National Council of Scientific Research
  for their support to achieve this work and the laboratory of Analytic Bio-inorganic
  Chemistry and Environment LCABIE CNRS/UPPA, France.\n\n"
