  sulfide inhibits diethylstilbestrol induced DNA damage in human breast epithelial
  cells MCF-10A.md
text: '


  Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in women in the United
  States. Diethylstilbestrol  is a synthetic estrogen that has been shown to cause
  cancer in animals and humans, altering cell viability as well as inducing DNA damage.
  Diallyl sulfide  is a garlic organosulfide that has been shown to inhibit both the
  initiation and promotion phases of cancer in vivo and in vitro, as well as reduce
  the risk of cancer in epidemiological studies. MCF-10A cells, regarded as a normal
  breast epithelial cell line, were treated with varying concentrations of DES, DAS
  or various dose combinations of DES and DAS concomitantly, and assessed for cell
  viability, DNA strand breaks, and lipid peroxidation. DES  in combination with 1,
  10, or 100 M DAS resulted in a 31%, 34%, or 36% respective increase in cell viability
  compared to the DES treatment alone, after 24 h. At the same time point, 1, 10,
  and 100 M DAS were all effective in significantly reducing DES -induced strand breaks
  to near that of the vehicle control. Additionally, 1 M DAS was effective in significantly
  reducing DES -induced lipid peroxidation after 3 h. The results of this research
  suggest that DAS is effective in recovering cell viability, attenuating DNA strand
  breaks, and decreasing lipid peroxidation in MCF-10A cells.'
