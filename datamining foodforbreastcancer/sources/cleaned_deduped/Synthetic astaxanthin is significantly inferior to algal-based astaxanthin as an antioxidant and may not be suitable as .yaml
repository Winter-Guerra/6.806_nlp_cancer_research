  astaxanthin  was tested against natural astaxanthin from Haematococcus pluvialis
  microalgae  for antioxidant activity. In vitro studies conducted at Creighton University
  and Brunswick Laboratories showed N-AX to be over 50 times stronger than S-AX in
  singlet oxygen quenching and approximately 20 times stronger in free radical elimination.
  N-AX has been widely used over the last 15 years as a human nutraceutical supplement
  after extensive safety data and several health benefits were established. S-AX,
  which is synthesised from petrochemicals, has been used as a feed ingredient, primarily
  to pigment the flesh of salmonids. S-AX has never been demonstrated to be safe for
  use as a human nutraceutical supple- ment and has not been tested for health benefits
  in humans. Due to safety concerns with the use of synthetic forms of other carotenoids
  such as can- thaxanthin and beta-carotene in humans, the au- thors recommend against
  the use of S-AX as a hu- man nutraceutical supplement until extensive, long-term
  safety parameters have been established and human clinical trials have been conducted
  showing potential health benefits. Additionally, differences in various other properties
  between S- AX and N-AX such as stereochemistry, esterification and the presence
  of supporting naturally occurring carotenoids in N-AX are discussed, all of which
  elicit further questions as to the safety and potential health benefits of S-AX.
  Ultimately, should S-AX prove safe for direct human consumption, dosage levels roughly
  2030 times greater than N-AX should be used as a result of the extreme difference
  in antioxidant activity between the two forms. Introduction Astaxanthin is a member
  of the carotenoid family. Carotenoids are divided into two groups: carotenes such
  as beta-carotene and lycopene, and xantho- phylls such as astaxanthin, lutein and
  canthaxan- thin. The main structural difference between the two groups is that xanthophylls
  exclusively have hydroxyl groups at the end of the molecules. Astax- anthin is unique
  in that it has more hydroxyl groups than other xanthophylls, which may account for

  1 3Healthcare 146 its superior antioxidant activity and its more diverse and profound
  health benefits in humans. Natural astaxanthin  occurs in Haematococcus pluvialis,
  a ubiquitous unicellular microalgae, which grows in fresh water throughout the world.
  Com- mercially, N-AX is extracted from H. pluvialis mi- croalgae grown in closed
  systems or open pond sys- tems by several different companies. When subjected to
  environmental stress, these algae hyperaccumu- late N-AX as a survival mechanism.
  N-AX protects the algae cells extremely efficiently; the algae can live for over
  40 years with no food or water and in extreme heat or cold due to the protective
  effects of N-AX. This natural form of astaxanthin was first sold as a human nutraceutical
  supplement in the late 1990s when it was allowed for sale by the US Food and Drug
  Administration  as a new di- etary ingredient. An extensive array of human clin-
  ical trials from around the world have established health benefits for N-AX in areas
  such as eye and brain health, UV protection and skin health, anti- inflammatory
  activity, immune system modulation and cardiovascular health among others. Synthetic
  astaxanthin  is produced by a highly involved, multistep process from petro- chemicals
  by a handful of large chemical compa- nies. During the steps in this process, the
  molecule assumes different forms before finally arriving at its final stage, when
  it attains the same chemical formula as N-AX. S-AX is then sold in the animal feed
  market where it is added primarily to fish feeds with the purpose of pigmenting
  the flesh of certain species of commercially farmed fish, predominantly salmonids
  such as Atlantic salmon and trout. S-AX has not undergone safety testing for direct
  human use and has not been documented to have any physiological benefits in humans;
  it has thus never been registered with regulatory authorities for direct human use
  in any country. The main differences between N-AX and S-AX are three-fold: Firstly,
  N-AX is comprised of 95% ester- ified molecules, both monoesterified and diesteri-
  fied  12:145-152 O O --R 7 15 8 1 3 3 5 8 14 7 1 R-- O O Figure 1 Diester of astaxanthin

  to the ends of the astax- anthin molecule). In Fig. 1, a diester of astaxanthin
  is shown where R and R are 16:0, 18:1  or 18:2. Compara- tively, S-AX is completely
  different from N-AX; it is exclusively free astaxanthin. Secondly, the N-AX and
  S-AX molecules are shaped differently. This difference in stereochemistry is evi-
  denced by the existence of three distinct enantiomers as seen in Fig. 2: enantiomer
  1 is 3S,3S, enantiomer 2 is 3R,3R and enantiomer 3 is 3R,3S. So, while natural and
  synthetic astaxanthin share the same molecular formula, 75% of the mol- ecules are
  shaped differently. The differences between N-AX and S-AX are also quite profound:
  1 3Healthcare 147 Nutrafoods  12:145-152  Esterification  Stereochemistry  The presence
  of three additional, naturally oc- curring carotenoids in N-AX  For these reasons,
  we suggest that the synthetically produced form must be considered unique from other
  forms and should not be introduced for direct human use until long-range safety
  parameters are established and human clinical trials showing po- tential benefits
  have been conducted. Another commercial source of astaxanthin is Xan- thophyllomyces
  dendrorhous. This is a species of yeast formerly known as Phaffia rhodozyma. While
  the yeast in nature produces small amounts of astaxan- thin, commercial manufacturers
  use a genetically mutated form to produce higher amounts of astax- anthin. The astaxanthin
  present in this yeast is ex- tremely different from the astaxanthin found in the
  marine food chain. For example, similar to S- AX, it has a completely different
  stereochemistry from N-AX. Another key difference is that it is 100% non-esterified.
  This astaxanthin product from mu- tated yeast is allowed for human consumption in
  some countries; however, due to insufficient safety data, use is only permitted
  with restrictions. For ex- ample, it is allowed by the US FDA, but with re- strictions
  against long-term use, against the use in children and, perhaps most significantly,
  at dosage levels of only 2 mg/day. Generally, a 2 mg dosage of N-AX has only been
  shown to be sufficient in human clinical research in the area of immunomod- ulation,
  one of many potential physiological benefits of astaxanthin. The literature does
  not con- tain human clinical research on this yeast form of astaxanthin. For this
  reason and due to safety con- cerns, discussion of this form of astaxanthin re-
  mains outside the scope of this paper. Materials and methods The free radicals superoxide

  3S,3S enantiomer.  S-AX contains a combination of three different enantiomers: It
  has 25% 3S,3S, but it contains primarily molecules shaped differently from N-AX:
  50% is meso-astaxanthin comprised of the 3R,3S enan- tiomer. Lastly, 25% is pure
  R enantiomer 3R,3R. Thirdly, S-AX is exclusively synthetic astaxanthin and contains
  no supporting carotenoids, while N- AX is naturally complexed in Haematococcus mi-
  croalgae with other carotenoids, as seen in Fig. 3. When lipids are extracted from
  the algae, the re- sulting extract contains primarily N-AX, but it also contains
  three other naturally occurring carotenoids. The resulting natural carotenoid complex
  contains approximately:  70% monoesterified astaxanthin  10% diesterified astaxanthin
  \ 5% free astaxanthin  6% beta-carotene  5% canthaxanthin  4% lutein Due to three
  clear differences between these two forms of astaxanthin, N-AX and S-AX cannot be
  considered the same molecule. While they share the same chemical formula, there
  are vast differ- ences between N-AX and S-AX in: 1 3Healthcare 148 Nutrafoods  12:145-152
  mM Tris-HCl buffer was incubated with 8 mU/ml of xanthine oxidase to generate superoxide
  anion.  Hydroxyl radical: The incubation mixture to gen- erate hydroxyl radical
  contained, in a total vol- ume of 2 ml, 5 mM Tris-HCl, 100 M FeCl 3, 100 M EDTA
  and 100 M xanthine. Xanthine oxi- dase  was added to initiate the reaction and to
  produce hydroxyl radicals. Chemiluminescence measurements Chemiluminescence, as
  an index of reactive oxygen species production, was measured in a Chronolog Lumivette
  luminometer. The assay was conducted in 3 ml glass minivials. The vials were incubated
  at 37C prior to measurement and the background chemilumines- cence of each vial
  was checked before use. Samples were preincubated at 37C for 15 min, and 4M lu-
  minol was added to enhance chemiluminescence. All additions to the vials as well
  as chemilumines- cence counting procedures were performed under dim lighting conditions.
  Results were examined as counts per unit of time minus background. Chemi- luminescence
  was monitored for 6 min at continu- ous 30-s intervals. Statistical analyses Significance
  between pairs of mean values was de- termined by Students t-test. p;0.05 was considered
  significant for analysis. Replicates for the Creighton University free radical inhibition

  analyses were conducted two to three times. Results In vitro work done at Creighton

  at eliminating free radicals when compared directly against these other antioxidants,
  including S-AX. N-AX was approximately 20 times more po- tent at free radical elimination
  than S-AX. Results are summarised in Table 1 and Fig. 4. Antioxidant activity of
  N-AX  and S-AX  was measured in a suite of tests by Brunswick Laboratories. Results
  are shown in Table 2. N-AX was 1 3Healthcare 149 Nutrafoods  12:145-152 55 times
  stronger than S-AX in eliminating singlet oxygen in vitro. Similar to the results
  at Creighton University cited above, N-AX was over 20 times stronger than S-AX in
  eliminating the superoxide ion. N-AX was 3.5 times stronger against peroxyl radicals.
  N-AX performed significantly worse than S-AX against peroxynitrite, with only 24%
  of the antioxidant power of S-AX. Peroxynitrite is pro- duced from the diffusion-controlled
  reaction be- tween nitric oxide and the superoxide anion. Per- oxynitrite interacts
  with lipids, DNA and proteins via direct oxidative reactions or via indirect, radi-
  cal-mediated mechanisms. However, N-AX de- creases nitric oxide production  and
  has very powerful activity against the superoxide anion and hence, would decrease
  the production of perox- ynitrite, rendering this particular result less mean- ingful.
  In the final survey by Brunswick Laborato- ries, antioxidant activity against hydroxyl
  radicals was measured. Unfortunately, a different procedure from that used at Creighton
  University was em- ployed, and no result was obtained for N-AX, ren- dering this
  test incomparable. Brunswick Labora- tories issues a summary score for this suite
  of antioxidant tests called oxygen radical absorbance capacity. Including the hydroxyl
  test for which the N-AX score was not determined and the peroxynitrite test in which
  S-AX performed better than N-AX, the summary result found N-AX to be 14 times stronger
  overall as an antioxidant than S- AX. The results are summarised in Table 2. Creighton
  University tests were carried out under the supervision of Debasis Bagchi, the developer
  of a method of free radical generation and an expert in antioxidant research. Brunswick
  Laboratories is regarded as a leading antioxidant research labora- tory, and while
  it is unclear why results for hy- droxyl radicals were unavailable for N-AX, it
  is clear that this lab is a competent source for antioxidant testing. One possible
  reason why the N-AX score in the hydroxyl radical test was not determined is that
  N-AX may not be soluble in the solvent used in this ORAC test. N-AX S-AX N-AX vs.

  power against various oxidants of N-AX vs. S-AX  Test Regardless of this minor issue
  with the ORAC test, the outcome of this research is clear: N-AX is a su- perior
  antioxidant to S-AX by more than an order of magnitude. Results range from approximately
  14 times stronger in the overall ORAC summary score to more than 20 times stronger
  in free radical elimination to as high as 55 times stronger in sin- glet oxygen
  quenching. Discussion N-AX has proven to be exceptionally more power- ful than other
  common antioxidants as well as S- AX; tested against other commonly used antioxi-
  dants, it scored a minimum of 14 to a maximum of 65 times higher in free radical
  elimination. Two separate antioxidant tests were performed directly comparing N-AX
  with S-AX, one at a leading uni- versity and the other at an independent laboratory
  specialising in antioxidant testing. The results of this testing showed that:  N-AX
  is approximately 55 times stronger than S- AX in singlet oxygen elimination.  N-AX
  is approximately 20 times stronger than S- AX in free radical elimination.  N-AX
  is approximately 14 times stronger than S- AX in the suite of antioxidant tests
  known as ORAC. For these reasons, should it be commercialised for human use, S-AX
  would have to be used at a rate 1455 times greater than N-AX to obtain the same
  antioxidant protection. Current dosage recommen- 1 3Healthcare 150 dations for humans
  for N-AX range from 2 to 16 mg/day based on extensive human clinical trials showing
  a wide range of health benefits. Based on this dosage range for N-AX, should S-AX
  be allowed for human use, the resulting recommended range would be a minimum of
  28 mg/day to a maximum of 880 mg/day when considering the differences in antioxidant
  activity. With an average difference of antioxidant measurements in the range of
  2030, and an average human dosage of 8 mg/day, the av- erage dose for S-AX would
  be in the proximity of 160240 mg/day. Before release to human con- sumers, long-range
  safety trials should be conducted at this dosage level to ensure that, unlike synthetic
  beta-carotene and synthetic canthaxanthin, there are no concerns with S-AX in areas
  such as carcino- genesis or retinal crystal formation. Other nutraceutical supplements
  that are available in both synthetic and natural forms show safety concerns with
  their synthetic form. This includes molecules closely related to astaxanthin such
  as the carotenoids beta-carotene and canthaxanthin as well as other nutraceuticals
  such as vitamin E. While the exact cause of the differences between natural and
  synthesised forms of nutraceuticals is not known, one logical theory is that synthesised
  compounds may not be the most physiologically valuable part of the natural nutrient
  complex. For example, synthesised vitamin E is exclusively DL- alpha tocopherol,
  while natural vitamin E is a com- plex of several mixed tocopherols and tocotrienols.
  Nutrients may be synergistic, meaning that they may work best when taken in concert
  with other compounds in their natural forms. Research has shown that synthetic vitamin
  E may be inferior to the natural form in its physiological properties. Synthetic
  E, which is exclusively DL- alpha tocopherol, has a limited ability to yield health
  benefits. Members of the natural vitamin E complex have essential independent functions.
  For example, the alpha-tocotrienol component of the natural E complex prevents neurodegeneration.
  To- cotrienols are not found in synthetic vitamin E. Nutrafoods  12:145-152 Also,
  synergy can play an important role in vitamin Es effects. In a study published in
  the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, it was found that alpha- tocopherol,
  gamma-tocopherol and selenium work in concert to prevent prostate cancer. In other
  words, benefits increased with the complete vitamin complex versus single synthesised
  molecules. Carotenoids in their synthetic forms in particular yield very significant
  safety concerns. The most re- searched carotenoid to date is beta-carotene. The
  literature is full of studies demonstrating a variety of health benefits for beta-carotene
  in areas such as immunity, prevention of cancer and skin health. However, the differences
  in absorption be- tween the synthetic and natural varieties of beta- carotene are
  profound; in one study, natural beta- carotene was absorbed ten times better than
  the synthetic form by rats and chickens. Not only is absorption a concern, but also
  efficacy. Similar to our results with S-AX versus N-AX in antioxidant potential,
  synthetic beta-carotene does not have the same antioxidant abilities as its natural
  cousin. Synthetic beta-carotene is primarily the trans form, while natural beta-carotene
  contains large amounts of the cis form. The 9-cis beta-carotene form, which is found
  in high amounts in natural beta-carotene, is a more efficient lipophilic antioxidant
  than the synthetic trans form. The stereochemistry of this carotenoid  is important
  in antioxidant potential as well as absorption and transport. Perhaps the most significant
  difference found in the literature between natural and synthetic forms of beta-carotene
  was demonstrated in the famous Finnish Smokers Study in the 1990s. After scores
  of epidemiological studies, in vitro and preclinical animal trials demonstrated
  that natural beta- carotene has cancer-preventative properties. A study of men from
  Finland who smoked on average three packs of cigarettes per day found an unex- pected
  outcome: when supplemented with syn- thetic beta-carotene, there was a slight increase
  in cancer among the treatment group versus the 1 3Healthcare 151 Nutrafoods  12:145-152
  placebo group. This study was very troubling to many consumers who were taking beta-carotene
  as a cancer preventative supplement. Further re- search comparing synthetic beta-carotene
  with nat- ural beta-carotene extracted from Dunaliella salina microalgae found that
  synthetic beta-carotene may be involved in the formation of cancer. This same study
  concluded that natural beta-carotene could be valuable in tumour prevention and
  supplemen- tary treatment. The possibility that synthetic beta-carotene may cause
  cancer while natural beta- carotene may prevent cancer is the most grave con- cern
  of all when considering the introduction of S- AX, a related carotenoid, as a supplement
  for human use. Synthetic canthaxanthin taken as a supplement has also yielded grave
  concerns. This is particularly relevant to our discussion in this paper since can-
  thaxanthin is in the same carotenoid family as beta-carotene and astaxanthin, but
  is even more closely related to astaxanthin than beta-carotene is. Canthaxanthin,
  like astaxanthin, falls into the xanthophyll subgroup since it has hydroxyl groups
  attached to its molecules. Natural canthaxanthin is not currently available commercially
  since sources for the natural form are limited. Canthax- anthin is, however, available
  in its synthetic form, and is used as an addition to animal feeds similar to S-AX.
  It is important to note that governments around the world consider synthetic canthaxanthin
  a safety concern, and limit or prohibit its use in animal feeds. The safety concern
  centres on crystallisation in the retina due to supplemen- tation with synthetic
  canthaxanthin. In the late 1980s, synthetic canthaxanthin was marketed as an internal
  tanning pill for people who wished to appear sun-tanned without going out in the
  sun. The product was abruptly taken off the market when golden crystals were found
  in consumers retinas. The crystallisation disappeared over time after discontinuing
  consumption of synthetic can- thaxanthin. But it is disconcerting to note how long
  reversal took: follow-up research published in 2011 found that complete disappearance
  of the golden crystals took approximately 20 years. The differences in regards to
  safety between natural and synthetic forms of nutraceutical supplements raise concern
  for the introduction of new synthetic versions of supplements. Particularly worrisome
  are the safety concerns with synthetic carotenoids. Syn- thetic beta-carotenes increase
  of cancer rates in smokers and synthetic canthaxanthin causing un- natural retinal
  crystallisation are clear evidence that extensive, long-range safety testing of
  S-AX and other synthetic carotenoids are necessary before re- lease to human consumers.
  Additionally, serious questions of efficacy exist with synthetic com- pounds such
  as synthetic vitamin E, synthetic beta- carotene and synthetic canthaxanthin when
  com- pared to their natural forms. The lack of efficacy and safety in synthetic
  supplements are most likely due to the profound differences between syntheti- cally
  produced nutraceutical compounds and their naturally occurring counterparts. For
  example, in the case of astaxanthin, far-ranging, extensive dif- ferences in the
  shape of the molecule; the esterifi- cation of the molecule; and the presence of
  other naturally occurring carotenoids in their natural form in N-AX lead us to the
  conclusion that S-AX and N-AX, although both called astaxanthin, must be considered
  completely different substances. For these reasons, the authors recommend against
  the use of S-AX in human nutraceutical supple- ments until extensive, long-range
  safety parameters are established and human clinical trials showing health benefits
  are conducted. In the event that S- AX attains these two milestones, due to the
  exten- sive differences between the two molecules, it should be distinctly labelled
  as synthetic astaxan- thin on consumer product labels, and dosage levels should
  be approximately 2030 times those of N- AX in order to obtain similar antioxidant
  activity. Acknowledgement This research was made possible by grants from Cyanotech
