  Ethanol consumption is a risk factor for the development of breast cancer and a
  possible promoter of breast cancer metastasis. However, the mechanisms of oncogenic
  action are still unknown. Previous studies have shown that breast cancer cells over-expressing
  ErbB2 have been more susceptible to ethanol-induced invasion and migration and that
  ER stress also promotes tumor metastasis. The objective of this study is to determine
  whether ethanol exposure may activate ErbB2 and induce ER stress in breast cancer
  cells. In this study, we test this hypothesis by examining the effect of ethanol
  on the activation of ErbB2 and eIF2/PKR. The enhanced phosphorylation of eIF2 and
  PKR are considered indicators of ER stress. MCF7 human breast cancer cells were
  treated with or without ethanol for 20 days. The results indicated that phosphorylated
  ErbB2 was increased by a factor of 1.4 in cells treated with 0.1% ethanol and by
  a factor of 1.2 for cells treated with 0.2% ethanol when compared to the untreated
  control. Also, phosphorylated eIF2 was shown to have a 1.3 and 1.2 fold increase
  in 0.1% and 0.2% ethanol, respectively, while phospho-PKR was shown to have a 1.7
  and 1.5 fold increase for 0.1% and 0.2% ethanol, respectively. These findings suggest
  that ethanol can activate ErbB2 and induce ER stress in breast cancer cells, which
  may result in increased metastasis. This study was supported by NIH grant. '
