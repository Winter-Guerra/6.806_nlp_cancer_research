text: "\n\nThe present investigation was carried out to study the relationship between
  presence of cytotoxic compounds in Ocimum basilicum, Alhagi maurorum, Calendula
  officinalis and their parasite Cuscuta campestris. The cytotoxic activity of the
  pure compounds was performed by MTT assay against breast cancer cell lines  and
  normal breast cell line. The induction of apoptosis was measured by the expression
  levels of p53, bcl-2, bax and caspase-3 genes using quantitative Real Time PCR.
  Three active fractions were detected by nuclear magnetic resonance as lutein, lupeol
  and eugenol, respectively, in C. officinalis, A. maurorum and O. basilicum. These
  compounds and their epoxidized forms were also detected in their parasite C. campestris.
  The cytotoxic activity of lutein epoxide, lupeol epoxide and eugenol epoxide was
  significantly more than lutein, lupeol and eugenol. The mRNA expression level of
  p53, caspase-3 and bax genes were increased in both cancer cells treated with all
  pure compounds. However, bcl-2 gene expression decreased in treated breast cancer
  cells. In conclusion, all the data indicated that the epoxide forms of lupeol, lutein
  and eugenol are potential drug candidates for inducing apoptosis in human breast
  cancer cells.\n\nCitation: Behbahani M  Evaluation of In Vitro Anticancer Activity

  is one of the most common diseases among women worldwide and the majority of cases
  have been reported in Asian countries over the past two decades. Currently, many
  studies have been carried out worldwide to isolate the active novel compounds from
  plants for cancer treatment. Several secondary metabolites including alkaloids,
  polyphenols, flavonoids and triterpenes were purified from medicinal plants. These
  products cause apoptosis which is modulated by direct or indirect modulating expression
  of some genes such as p53, bcl2 and caspase-3,. However, it is important to develop
  the natural chemopreventive agents which evaluate cytotoxicity and apoptosis induction
  in cancer cell lines. Therefore, we became eager to assess Iranian species with
  respect to their anti-cancer activity and determine their active constituents. The
  genus Cuscuta  also known as dodder is an obligate stem parasite with a worldwide
  distribution. Cuscuta campestris is the most common species in the genus Cuscuta
  and grown on wide range of host species. In recent decades, through extracting natural
  compounds from cuscuta specious a number of compounds such as cuscutin, amarbelin,
  -sitosterol, stigmasterol, kaempferol, dulcitol, myricetin, quercetin, coumarin
  and oleanolic acid have been isolated,. C. campestris has been proved to have analgesic,
  antipyretic, anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties on different hosts. Some
  studies have reported that some secondary metabolites transferred from host to the
  parasite and responsible for medical properties of parasite,. Three Iranian common
  hosts for C. Campestris are Alhagi maurorum, Calendula officinalis and Ocimum basilicum.
  Medicinal activity of these plants has been also subjected by several investigations
  . So far, cytotoxic activity of C.campestris and the relationship with its hosts
  has not been investigated yet. Hence, the present study is focused to evaluate anticancer
  potential of pure compounds isolated from A. maurorum, C. officinalis, O. basilicum
  and their parasite C. campestris against breast cancer cell lines  and human normal
  breast cancer cell line.\n\nNo ethics statement was necessary for this study. The
  study was only carried out in vitro on an immortalized cell line. None of these
  species is an endangered or protected species and did not need a permit.\n\nThe
  aerial parts of O. basilicum, A. maurorum, C. officinalis and their parasite C.
  campestris were collected from university of Isfahan herbarium, Iran, in Feb 2011.
  The specimen was identified in University of Isfahan herbarium, Iran. One kg of
  each sample was carefully dried in a well-ventilated dark room and powdered. Finally,
  the dried powders were obtained.\n\nMethanol extracts of the powdered aerial parts
  of O. basilicum, A. maurorum, C. officinalis and their parasite C. campestris  were
  prepared. The extraction was done three times at room temperature  by the maceration
  method. The crude methanol extract of each sample was concentrated by a rotary evaporator
  \ and freeze dried. Silica-gel column fractionation chromatography was separately
  performed with 5 g of each methanol extract and eluted with hexan: acetone: methanol.
  The following fractions have been obtained from these three plants and their parasite.
  The anticancer activity of all fractions were verified by MTT assay.\n\nFractions
  117  from O. basilicum and fractions 123 from its parasite C. campestris  were obtained.
  Fraction 13 from O. basilicum and fractions 17 and 23 from C. campestris were the
  most active fractions.\n\nFractions 125  from A. maurorum and fractions 127 from
  its parasite C. campestris  were achieved. Fraction 15 from A. maurorum and fractions
  16 and 21 from its parasite C. campestris were the most active fractions.\n\nFractions
  126  from C. officinalis and fractions 124 from its parasite C. campestris  were
  obtained. Fraction 19 of C. officinalis and fractions 14 and 17 of C.campestris
  were the most active fractions. The active fractions were detected with Nuclear
  Magnetic Resonance.\n\nNMR screening was used to identify trace compounds in each
  fraction. 1H NMR and 1C NMR data were recorded on Bruker 400 MHz spectrometer by
  use of CDCl3 and DMSO as residual solvent with chemical shifts expressed in parts
  per million.\n\nThe cell line MCF 10A, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 were acquired from National
  Cell Bank of Pasture Institute, Tehran, Iran. Cell lines were cultured in Dulbeccos
  Modified Eagle Medium  complemented with 10% heat-inactivated Fetal Bovine Serum,
  100 U/ml penicillin and 100 g ml streptomycin and 5 mM L Glutamine. The cell lines
  were grown at 37C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. All reagents and
  cell culture media were purchased from the Gibco Company.\n\nThe cytotoxic activity
  of active fractions isolated from O. basilicum, A.maurorum, C. officinalis and their
  parasite C. campestris on cultured cells were measured using MTT assay. The cells
  were grown in 96-well plates at a density of 5104 cells per well. After incubation
  for 24 h, the cells were treated with different concentrations of samples and incubated
  for 48 h. Later, the MTT solution  was added to each well, and the plate was re-incubated
  for an additional 4 h. Finally, the medium was removed and 100 l of DMSO was added
  to solubilize the formed formazan crystals. The amount of formazan crystal was determined
  by measuring the absorbance at 492 nm using a microplate spectrophotometer. The
  50% cytotoxic concentration  of all pure compounds was calculated. All assays were
  done in triplicate.\n\nExpression levels of four widely established apoptotic-related
  mRNAs, p53, bcl-2, bax and caspase-3 were analyzed using Real Time PCR assay as
  described previously,. MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with all pure compounds
  at 1/4 of CC50 values for 6 and 12 h periods. Total cellular RNA was isolated from
  the untreated and treated cells using the Tri-Pure Isolation Reagent, according
  to the manufacturers instructions.\n\nReal Time PCR was performed to quantify the
  amount of mRNA in untreated and treated cells. A PCR reaction mixture of 50 l containing
  5 l of dH2O, 25 L of Taq Man Universal PCR MasterMix, 5 l of primer forward, 5 l
  primer reverse, 5 l FAM- TAMRA probes, 0.5 l of reverse transcriptase, 2 l random
  hexmer and 2 l of purified RNA was used. Five pairs of primers were separately used:
  four pairs to amplify the p53, bcl2, bax and caspase-3 genes, the other pair for
  the endogenous control gene, gapdh. The primers and probes have been shown in Table
  1. Real-time PCR was carried out on Corbett Cycler. Cycling conditions were as follows:
  initial reverse transcription at 55C for 45 min, 1 cycle denaturation of 95C with
  10 min hold, followed by 40 cycles of 95C with 15 s hold, annealing temperature
  at 60C  with a 60 s hold. A negative control was included in each run to access
  specificity of primers and possible contamination. Primers and probes were synthesized
  by Metabion Company.\n\nThe expression levels of p53, caspase-3, bcl-2 and bax proteins
  in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were assessed by western blot method as described
  by Fido et al.. Both cells  were treated with lutein epoxide, lupeol epoxide, eugenol
  epoxide, lutein, lupeol and eugenol at 1/4 of CC50 values for 48 h at 37C. Cells
  were lysed with 10 l of lyses buffer  for 2 h under gentle agitation at room temperature.
  The blots were washed three times and incubated with horse reddish peroxdase-conjugated
  anti-mouse IgG antibody for 1 h at 37C. Then the signal was detected with an enhanced
  chemiluminescence detection kit. Diaminobenzidine reagent was used to develop the
  immunoblots.\n\nThe data of three independent experiments are presented as meanSD.
  The CC50 values were calculated by Microsoft Excel 2003. The students unpaired t-test
  was used to evaluate significance between the test sample and solvent control. One-way
  analysis of variance  followed by a Dunnett post hoc test was performed to evaluate
  significance differences among different groups. P value ;0.05 was shown to be statistically
  significant.\n\nThe most active fraction obtained from O. basilicum was fraction
  13, which analyzed by NMR experiment as eugenol. Fractions 17 and 23 were also isolated
  from its parasite C.campestris and determined as eugenol and eugenol epoxide. Fraction
  15 of A. maurorum and fractions 16 and 21 of C.campestris were analyzed as lupeol,
  lupeol and lupeol epoxide respectively. Fraction 19 of C. officinalis and fractions
  14 and 17 of C.campestris were analyzed as lutein, lutein and lutein epoxide.\n\n1HNMR

  concentrations of lutein, lupeol, eugenol, lutein epoxide, lupeol epoxide, eugenol
  epoxide were tested for cytoxicity against MCF7, MDA-MB-231 and MCF 10A cells. These
  compounds were tested under comparable conditions at different concentrations. All
  pure compounds showed dose-dependent cytotoxic activity on MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cell
  lines. The 1/4 of CC50 values of lutein, lupeol, eugenol, lutein epoxide, lupeol
  epoxide and eugenol epoxide were, respectively, &gt;100, &gt;100, 84, 15, 17.5,
  75 g/ml for MCF7 and 100, &gt;100, 55, 7.5, 11.5, 48 g/ml for MDA-MB-231. As a result,
  cytotoxic activity of lupeol, lutein, lupeol epoxide and lutein epoxide against
  MDA-MB cancer cell line was rather than MCF7 cancer cell line. The cytotoxic activity
  of lupeol, lutein and eugenol were significantly lower than epoxide forms of these
  compounds. The results also showed that cytotoxic activity of these extracts on
  MCF7 and MDA-MB cells were significantly more than MCF 10A cells.\n\nFigure 1.  Cytotoxic
  activity of lutein epoxide, lupeol epoxide, eugenol epoxide, lutein, lupeol and
  eugenol against MCF7, MDA-MB231 and MCF 10A cell lines.\n\nThe expression levels
  of apoptosis-related genes in MCF7 and MDA-MB 231 cells which induced by with 6
  separate pure compounds at 1/4 of CC50 values were determined. The mRNA levels of
  p53, caspase3, bax and bcl-2 were evaluated by Real time PCR. Fig. 2 showed that
  the expression level of p53 and bcl2, respectively, increased and decreased in both
  cells treated with lupeol, lupeol epoxide, lutein, lutein epoxide, eugenol and eugenol
  epoxide for 6 and 12 h incubation compared to untreated cells. The expression level
  of p53 and bcl2 in both breast cancer cells treated with these compounds was time
  dependent. Fig. 3 indicated that the relative expression of bax was increased in
  cells treated with all pure compounds for 6 and 12 h incubation compared to untreated
  cells. The relative expression of caspase-3 in MDA-MB-231 cancer cells treated with
  these extracts was also increased as time-dependent to reach the maximum level at
  12 h after stimulation. The absence of caspase-3 in MCF-7 cell leads to lack of
  any gene expression in treated and untreated cells.\n\nFigure 2.  Time dependency
  effects of p53 and bcl-2 mRNA levels in human breast cancer cell line, MCF7, incubated
  with lutein, lupeol, eugenol, lutein epoxide, lupeol epoxide, eugenol epoxide at
  1/4 of CC50 values for 6 h and 12 h incubation.\n\ngapdh was used as an endogenous
  control gene. The stars indicate that the data are significantly different  from
  the untreated control.\n\nFigure 3.  Time dependency effects of caspase 3 and bax
  mRNA levels in human breast cancer cell line, MCF7 and MDA-MB 231 incubated with
  lutein, lupeol, eugenol, lutein epoxide, lupeol epoxide, eugenol epoxide at 1/4
  of CC50 values for 6 h and 12 h incubation.\n\ngapdh was used as an endogenous control
  gene. The stars indicate that the data are significantly different  from the untreated
  control.\n\nThe expression level of bcl2, bax and p53 proteins in MCF7 and MDA-MB23
  cells treated with lutein, lupeol, eugenol, lutein epoxide, lupeol epoxide, eugenol
  epoxide along with -actin as an internal control are shown by western blotting analysis.
  p53 and bax genes expressed, respectively, 53-kda and 21-kda proteins on western
  blotting. MDA and MCF7 cells also encode a 32-kDa and 24-kda proteins whose association
  with caspase-3 and bcl2 proteins. As shown in Fig. 4, Western blot analysis showed
  the increase in band intensity of p53 and bax proteins in MCF7 and MDA cells when
  compared to the internal control -actin. caspase-3 was also increased in MDA cells
  compared to -actin. The absence of caspase-3 gene in MCF-7 cell leads to lack of
  any caspase-3 protein in treated and untreated cells. bcl2 protein was decreased
  in cancer cells treated by all compounds at 1/4 of CC50 values.\n\nFigure 4.  Western
  blot analysis of MDA-MB-231 and MCF7 treated with lutein, lupeol, eugenol, lutein
  epoxide, lupeol epoxide  and eugenol epoxide.\n\nWestern blot analysis was performed
  with monoclonal antibodies to human bcl-2, p53 and bax. -actin was used as loading
  control.\n\nMedicinal plants have been used widely in traditional medicine for cancer
  treatment. In this study, lutein epoxide, lupeol epoxide and eugenol epoxide isolated
  from C. campestris were considered as potential anticancer compounds. Lutein and
  lutein epoxide are plant cartenoids which is widely distributed in leaves and fruits
  of many plants such as tangerine, olive fruits, peas and pumpkins,. Antioxidant
  and cytotoxic activity of lutein and oxidized lutein in Hela cells have been report
  previously. Lupeol and lupeol epoxide are naturally occurring triterpenoids which
  found in many plants, including olive, mango, crataeva and strawberry. However,
  lupeol and its derivatives have also been reported to possess a wide spectrum of
  medicinal properties such as anticancer, antibacterial and antifungi properties
  . Eugenol and its derivatives have been identified in various plants, such as basil,
  cinnamon, lemon balm and clove. In the present study, the active compounds of lutein,
  lupeol and eugenol were observed, respectively, in C. officinalis, A. maurorum and
  O. basilicum. The epoxide forms of these compounds were also detected in their parasite
  C. campestris. The mRNA expression level of p53, caspase-3 and bax genes were increased
  and bcl-2 gene expression decreased in breast cancer cells treated with these six
  compounds. The bcl-2 proteins are able to inhibit programmed cell death. So the
  expression of bcl-2 corresponds with the status of p53 in cells. Bax is another
  pro-apoptotic protein, which increases apoptosis in cells. The result of this study
  demonstrated that p53 is involved in apoptosis which induced by lutein, lupeol,
  eugenol, lutein epoxide, lupeol epoxide and eugenol epoxide. There would be decreased
  expression of bcl-2 and increased expression of bax proteins in treated cells compared
  with nontreated cells. Importantly, the ratio of bax/bcl-2 protein expression after
  treatment was dose-dependently increased which indicated the susceptibility of MCF-7
  and MDA-MB-231 cells toward apoptosis. This study concluded that some anticancer
  compounds transferred from host to the parasite C. campestris and change to epoxide
  forms.\n\nThe results of detection of bioactive compounds signified that eugenol
  epoxide, lutein epoxide and lupeol epoxide constituted the most active fractions
  in the crude methanol extract of C. campestris and displayed the cytotoxic effects
  on breast cancer cell.\n\nno additional contributions. Conceived and designed the
