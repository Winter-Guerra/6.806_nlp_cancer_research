  Acid Exerts Anti-proliferation Effects via Modulation of Tgf-Smad3 Signaling in
  MCF-7 Breast Cancer Cells.md
text: '


  Ellagic acid has been shown to inhibit tumor cell growth. However, the underlying
  molecular mechanisms remain elusive. In this study, our aim was to investigate whether
  ellagic acid inhibits the proliferation of MCF- 7 human breast cancer cells via
  regulation of the TGF-/Smad3 signaling pathway. MCF-7 breast cancer cells were transfected
  with pEGFP-C3 or pEGFP-C3/Smad3 plasmids, and treated with ellagic acid alone or
  in combination with SIS3, a specific inhibitor of Smad3 phosphorylation. Cell proliferation
  was assessed by MTT assay and the cell cycle was detected by flow cytometry. Moreover,
  gene expression was detected by RT-PCR, real-time PCR and Western blot analysis.
  The MTT assay showed that SIS3 attenuated the inhibitory activity of ellagic acid
  on the proliferation of MCF-7 cells. Flow cytometry revealed that ellagic acid induced
  G0/G1 cell cycle arrest which was mitigated by SIS3. Moreover, SIS3 reversed the
  effects of ellagic acid on the expression of downstream targets of the TGF-/Smad3
  pathway. In conclusion, ellagic acid leads to decreased phosphorylation of RB proteins
  mainly through modulation of the TGF-/Smad3 pathway, and thereby inhibits the proliferation
  of MCF-7 breast cancer cells. '
