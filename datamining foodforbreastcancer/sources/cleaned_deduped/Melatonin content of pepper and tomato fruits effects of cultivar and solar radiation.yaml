  content of pepper and tomato fruits effects of cultivar and solar radiation.md
text: '


  We evaluated the effect of cultivar and solar radiation on the melatonin content
  of Capsicum annuum  and Solanum lycopersicum  fruits. The melatonin content of red
  pepper fruits ranged from 31 to 93 ng g1. The melatonin content of tomato ranged
  from 7.5 to 250 ng g1. We also studied the effect of ripeness on melatonin content
  and identified one group of pepper cultivars in which the melatonin content increased
  as the fruit ripened and another in which it decreased as the fruit ripened. Under
  shade conditions, the melatonin content in most of tomato cultivars tended to increase,
  whereas that of most pepper cultivars decreased. Overall, the results also demonstrated
  that the melatonin content of the fruits was not related to carbon fluxes from leaves.'
