text: [Mammographic density is one of the strongest predictors of breast cancer risk.,
  'Recently, it has been suggested that reactive oxygen species may influence breast
    cancer risk through its influence on mammographic density.', 'In the current study,
    we addressed this hypothesis and also assessed if the association between carotenoids
    and breast cancer risk varies by mammographic density.', We conducted a nested
    case-control study consisting of 604 breast cancer cases and 626 controls with
    prospectively measured circulating carotenoid levels and mammographic density
    in the Nurses Health Study., 'Circulating levels of -carotene, -carotene, -cryptoxanthin,
    lycopene, and lutein/zeaxanthin were measured.', We used a computer-assisted thresholding
    method to measure percent mammographic density., We found no evidence that circulating
    carotenoids are inversely associated with mammographic density., 'However, mammographic
    density significantly modified the association between total circulating carotenoids
    and breast cancer.', 'Overall, circulating total carotenoids were inversely associated
    with breast cancer risk.', 'Among women in the highest tertile of mammographic
    density, total carotenoids were associated with a 50% reduction in breast cancer
    risk.', 'In contrast, there was no inverse association between carotenoids and
    breast cancer risk among women with low mammographic density.', 'Similarly, among
    women in the highest tertile of mammographic density, high levels of circulating
    -carotene, -cryptoxanthin, lycopene, and lutein/zeaxanthin were associated with
    a significant 40% to 50% reduction in breast cancer risk.', 'Our results suggest
    that plasma levels of carotenoids may play a role in reducing breast cancer risk,
    particularly among women with high mammographic density.']
