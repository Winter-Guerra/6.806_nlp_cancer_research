text: ['Fatty acids are endogenous ligands of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha,
    which is linked to the regulation of fatty acid uptake, lipid metabolism and breast
    cancer cell growth.', 'This study was designed to screen candidate fatty acids
    from breast cancer tissue and to investigate the effects of these candidate fatty
    acids on PPAR expression, cell growth and cell cycle progression in breast cancer
    cell lines.', One breast cancer tissue and one reference tissue were each taken
    from 30 individual breasts to examine for fatty acid composition and PPAR expression.,
  'The cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231, MCF-7  and BT-474  were used to explore the mechanisms
    regulating cell proliferation.', We found that arachidonic acid  and PPAR were
    highly expressed in the breast cancer tissues., AA stimulated the growth of all
    three breast cancer cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner., 'The growth stimulatory
    effect of AA was associated with PPAR activation, and the most potent effect was
    found in MCF-7 cells.', 'The stimulation of cell proliferation by AA was accompanied
    by the increased expression of cyclin E, a reduced population of G1 phase cells,
    and a faster G1/S phase transition.', 'In contrast, AA had no effects on the levels
    of CDK2, CDK4, cyclin D1, p27, Bcl-2 and Bax.', 'Our results demonstrate that
    high levels of AA and PPAR expression in human breast cancer tissues are associated
    with ER-overexpressed breast cancer cell proliferation, which is involved in activating
    PPAR, stimulating cyclin E expression, and promoting faster G1/S transition.']
