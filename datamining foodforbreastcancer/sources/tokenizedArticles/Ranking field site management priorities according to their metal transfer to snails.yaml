text: [Current soil quality evaluation does not include an assessment of metal bioavailability
    to organisms., 'However, sentinel soil-dwelling invertebrates can be used for
    such an assessment.', This study aims to establish the modulating soil parameter
    of metal bioavailability to snails and a procedure for ranking field sites  based
    on the evaluation of the transfer of metals to the land snails used as indicators
    of metal zooavailability., 'Multivariate regressions identify soil pH, organic
    carbon and iron oxides influence cadmium, chromium, copper, lead and zinc zooavailability
    to snails underlining the need to consider other parameter than total soil concentration
    during bioavailability assessment.', 'However, for As, no influence of soil parameter
    on it bioavailability to snails was identified.', 'Internal Concentrations of
    Reference  of Cd, Pb, As, Cr, Cu and Zn were determined in Cantareus aspersus
    that were caged on unpolluted plots.', CIRef allow for the identification of contaminated
    sites., 'CIRef have revealed unexpected metal transfer on some unpolluted sites
    and a lack of transfer on some contaminated sites, thus confirming the necessity
    for biological measures to evaluate metal mobility.', The Sum of Excess of Transfers  index
    ranked the industrially impacted sites as the top priorities for management.]
