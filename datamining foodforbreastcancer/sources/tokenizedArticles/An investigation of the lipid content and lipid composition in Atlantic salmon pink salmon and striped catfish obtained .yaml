text: ['The aim of this study is to investigate the lipid content and lipid composition
    of fatty acids in Atlantic salmon, pink salmon  and striped catfish, obtained
    at the local retailers in Uppsala, Sweden.', Then explore the cause of the differences
    in the fatty acids between the three fish species., 'In addition, the present
    data will be compared to the data available at National Food Ad-ministration in
    Sweden  and National Institute of Nutrition and Seafood Research in Norway.',
  'Fish is a main food that provides n-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, and
    is to many people known to be a healthy choice as food.', It is particularly the
    n-3 LCPUFAs that have been shown to have positive effects on for example cardiovascular
    disease and cancer., 'Docosahexaenoic  and eicosapentaenoic  are n-3 LCPUFAs,
    present in fish and fish oils.', 'The demand for fish raw material as fish feed
    is rising around the world, and this depends on a steady increase of aquaculture
    production.', A change from using fish raw material to use more ingredients based
    on vegetables have been investigated., 'There is a consequence of this change
    from fish raw material to plant based material on human health, where the degree
    of long chain n-3 fatty acids have been lowered in the fish and the beneficial
    health effects of fish on humans is therefore decreas-ing.', In vegetable oils
    there is a high concentration of n-6 and n-9 fatty acids that is mostly linoleic
    acid and oleic acid respectively., In vegetable oils there are also low or moderate
    levels of n-3 fatty acids  of mostly -linolenic acid., 'Although vege-table oils
    do not have the long chain highly unsaturated fatty acids, EPA and DHA.', 'In
    this study seven different samples were taken from Atlantic salmon, pink salmon
    and striped catfish.', 'The samples all have different origin and label, and all
    the samples were from a farmed fish fillet except one wild fish.', The samples
    tested in this study were all homogenized and the fat of the samples was extracted.,
  Fatty acid composition was ana-lyzed by a gas chromatograph., 'The fat content in
    the four farmed Atlantic salmon samples was: 7.0, 7.6, 9.4 and 7.4 % respectively.',
  'The fat content in the wild pink salmon was: 3.0 %.', The fat content in the two
    farmed striped catfish samples was 0.3 and 0.5 %., The proportion of fatty acids
    was all measured in % of total fatty acids., 'The percentage of EPA  and DHA  was
    higher in the farmed Atlantic salmon and wild pink salmon, compared to the farmed
    striped catfish, as expected.', 'Linoleic acid  was significantly higher in the
    farmed striped catfish, and lower in both the farmed Atlantic salmon and wild
    pink salmon.', -linolenic acid  was present at a smaller percentage in the farmed
    striped catfish than in both the farmed Atlantic salmon and wild pink salmon.,
  'The n3/n6 ratio was signifi-cantly higher in the wild pink salmon, than in both
    the farmed Atlantic salmon and farmed striped catfish.', <th>]
