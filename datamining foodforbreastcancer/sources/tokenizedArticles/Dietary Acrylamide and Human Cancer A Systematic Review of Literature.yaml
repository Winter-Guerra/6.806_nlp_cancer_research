    and 32.20  19.80 g/day among controls.', There were no associations observed between
    dietary acrylamide exposure  and pancreatic cancer., 'In addition, there were
    no statistically significant associations when dietary acrylamide exposure was
    modeled as continuous variable.', Dietary patterns and different food sources
    of acrylamide contribute to varying dietary acrylamide exposure among different
    populations., 'Large variations have been reported in acrylamide content among
    different brands of similar food items, and such data is not being collected on
    the FFQ.', 'Although, FFQs are a useful tool for assessing usual dietary pattern
    they were not designed for capturing chemical exposures.', 'Information such as
    recipe information, browning of food, length of cooking, micronutrient composition
    of the raw food, storage of food, and so on is not being collected but is highly
    important for assessing acrylamide exposures.', The measurement errors resulting
    from above discussed factors have potential for misclassification for ranking
    individuals for high vs. low acrylamide exposure., 'The subsequent lack of reproducibility
    of epidemiological results points toward the utmost need for developing better
    methods to capture true intake, which would include absorption and metabolism
    assessments and would be capable of separating dietary exposure from other sources.',
  'The studies that estimated acrylamide using FFQ as well as acrylamide adducts,
    reported a lack of strong correlation between FFQ and HbAA, suggesting that these
    measurements represent exposures over the different time interval lengths.', 'The
    HbAA measures the exposure from the last 120 days, and even by assuming that the
    FFQ is adequately capturing long-term dietary acrylamide exposures, the correlation
    could be influenced by seasonality, recent exposures, and so on.', 'For chronic
    disease endpoints such as cancer, the goal is to estimate long-term exposure as
    compared to recent ones.', 'So, one could potentially estimate the HbAA pattern
    by measuring repeated HbAA adducts over a long period of time will be highly useful.',
  'In the absence of food-specific biomarkers, controlled feeding studies among healthy
    volunteers to evaluate the changes in the HbAA adduct levels by changing the dietary
    acrylamide intake doses are lacking.', Such studies would provide the evidence
    about the maximal reduction of acrylamide that could be achieved by reducing the
    food-related acrylamide intake and would also provide evidence of the proportion
    of acrylamide exposure from other environmental sources., 'Foods that are sources
    of acrylamide also contain a range of nutrients and most of these foods are high-energy
    sources, resulting in a high correlation between energy, nutrients, and acrylamide.',
  'High-energy intake itself is associated with obesity and the increased the risk
    of several cancers, as well as exposure to acrylamide.', Most of the studies included
    in this review used several statistical approaches to reduce the effect of energy
    on the association between acrylamide and cancer., Future studies that compare
    people with balanced diet vs. more Western-type diet may provide additional insight
    into associations between dietary acrylamide and cancer., 'Because smoking is
    an established source of acrylamide exposure, the majority of the reviewed studies
    adjusted for smoking status and included separate models for never-smokers.',
  Future studies of dietary acrylamide that accounts for secondhand smoke exposure
    and with large sample size of never-smokers are needed., 'Although a number of
    studies have reported disparity in acrylamide intake, with children being at the
    highest exposure level, none of the studies to date has evaluated childhood exposure
    to acrylamide as a potential risk factor for cancer later in life.', 'It is unknown
    if the magnitude of associations would be different for populations who are generally
    considered vulnerable such as older adults, and populations who are at higher
    risk for cancer due to weak immune response and other underlying diseases.', 'In
    the reviewed epidemiologic studies, the dietary acrylamide exposure assessment
    has been inadequate leading to potential misclassification.', 'In addition, the
    case-control studies have reported nearly same magnitude of dietary acrylamide
    exposures among both cases and controls.', 'For disease endpoint such as cancer,
    the exposure assessment methods that could capture the long-term exposures are
    highly recommended.', 'However, majority of the reviewed epidemiologic studies
    have rather estimated one-time point exposures from the baseline FFQs with the
    huge assumption that the dietary acrylamide content as well as the individual
    exposures over time remained constant.', This is especially worrisome since a
    number of new food items are introduced in the market each year., 'In addition,
    food consumption patterns can be influenced by factors such as seasonality, prices,
    sales, as well as social factors such as holidays resulting in potential changes
    in dietary acrylamide exposure.', 'The future studies with improved dietary acrylamide
    exposure assessment by including longitudinal HbAA adducts every 3 mo, along with
    improved tools of dietary assessment are highly encouraged.', 'Until we have the
    improved exposure assessment methods incorporated, the epidemiologic studies assessing
    relationship between dietary acrylamide and cancer will not have any meaningful
    interpretations.', This work was funded by the International Life Sciences Institute  North
