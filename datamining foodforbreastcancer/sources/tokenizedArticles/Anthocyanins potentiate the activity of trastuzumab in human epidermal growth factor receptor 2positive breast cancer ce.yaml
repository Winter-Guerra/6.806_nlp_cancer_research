text: [Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2  has been found to be overexpressed
    in ~25% of invasive breast cancer and is significantly associated with a poor
    prognosis in breast cancer patients., The anthocyanins cyanidin3glucoside  and
    peonidin3glucoside have been identified as potential drugs for the therapy of
    HER2positive breast cancer., 'They have been used as supplements in targeted therapeutics
    and chemotherapeutics in Asia, however, the underlying mechanism remains to be
    elucidated.', The aim of the present study was to investigate the synergism between
    C3G and trastuzumab., 'To address this question, the response to C3G, Trast and
    a combination of the two drugs, in three representative HER2positive cell lines
    was evaluated.', 'The combination treatments induced apoptosis, inhibited cell
    growth and affected HER2 and its downstream signaling pathway in MDAMB453, BT474
    and HCC1569 cells, and the effects were synergistic.', The combination of 3CG
    and Trast inhibited tumor growth in an in vivo xenograft model., The data from
    the present study suggested that C3G exhibits potent antitumor activity when combined
    with Trast under the investigated conditions.]
