text: [There is little published information on the prevalence of Salmonella in edible
    nut kernels., A study in early 2008 of edible roasted nut kernels on retail sale
    in England was undertaken to assess the microbiological safety of this product.,
  A total of 727 nut kernel samples of different varieties were examined., 'Overall,
    Salmonella and Escherichia coli were detected from 0.2 and 0.4% of edible roasted
    nut kernels.', 'Of the nut varieties examined, Salmonella Havana was detected
    from 1  sample of pistachio nuts, indicating a risk to health.', 'The United Kingdom
    Food Standards Agency was immediately informed, and full investigations were undertaken.',
  Further examination established the contamination to be associated with the pistachio
    kernels and not the partly opened shells., Salmonella was not detected in other
    varieties tested., 'E. coli was found at low levels  in walnuts, almonds, and
    Brazils.', The presence of Salmonella is unacceptable in edible nut kernels.,
  'Prevention of microbial contamination in these products lies in the application
    of good agricultural, manufacturing, and storage practices together with a hazard
    analysis and critical control points system that encompass all stages of production,
    processing, and distribution.']
