text: [The aim of the study was to determine the effect of different types of sugar
    on the formation of heterocyclic amines  in marinated grilled chicken., 'Chicken
    breast samples were marinated with table sugar, brown sugar, and honey for 24
    h at 4 C. The internal temperature, weight loss, free amino acids, sugars, and
    HCA were determined.', The concentrations of all types of HCA  in samples that
    were marinated with table sugar were significantly higher  than brown sugar; whereas
    those were marinated with honey had the lowest HCA concentrations., 'A substantial
    reduction in the concentration of MeIQ, PhIP, DiMeIQx, IQ, IQx, and norharman
    was achieved in chicken marinated with honey.', 'A correlation study indicated
    that adding honey into the recipe retarded the formation of most HCA, whereas
    table sugars enhanced the formation of all HCA except norharman, harman, and AC.']
