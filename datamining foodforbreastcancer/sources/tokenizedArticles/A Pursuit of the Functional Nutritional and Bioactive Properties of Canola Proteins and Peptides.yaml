text: ['This review focuses on updated information about canola proteins and peptides,
    their functional, nutritional, and bioactive properties, safety aspects, and potential
    application in foods.', 'Attention is paid to gelation, emulsion, thermal, and
    water holding capacities of crude and pure proteins and peptides isolated from
    canola meal.', Various factors affecting these properties are discussed., This
    paper provides an overview of use of canola meal as a protein source in animal
    diets and their digestibility in vivo., 'Their effects on a range of health outcomes
    including ACE inhibition, hypocholesterolemic effects, cancer prevention, anti-viral
    and anti-diabetic properties are reviewed on the basis of the available in vitro
    and in vivo animal and human data.', The review also focuses on the safety aspects
    and selected food applications of canola proteins and peptides.]
