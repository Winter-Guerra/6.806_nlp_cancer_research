text: [The n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid 5-lipoxygenase pathway has been shown to
    play a role in the carcinogenesis of breast cancer., 'We conducted a population-based
    case-control study among Latina, African-American, and White women from the San
    Francisco Bay area to examine the association of the 5-lipoxygenase gene  and
    5-lipoxygenase-activating protein gene  with breast cancer risk.', Three ALOX5AP
    polymorphisms  and three ALOX5 polymorphisms  were genotyped in 802 cases and
    888 controls., 'We did not find significant main effects of ALOX5 and ALOX5AP
    genotypes on breast cancer risk that were consistent across race or ethnicity;
    however, there was a significant interaction between the ALOX5AP 4900 A&gt;G polymorphism
    and dietary linoleic acid intake.', 'Among women consuming a diet high in linoleic
    acid, carrying the AA genotype was associated with higher breast cancer risk  compared
    with carrying genotypes AG or GG.', 'Among women consuming 17.4 g/d of linoleic
    acid, ALOX5AP 4900 genotype was not associated with breast cancer risk.', These
    results support a role for n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids in breast carcinogenesis
    and suggest that epidemiologic studies on dietary fat and breast cancer should
    take into account genetic predisposition related to n-6 polyunsaturated fatty
    acid metabolism., ':274854)']
