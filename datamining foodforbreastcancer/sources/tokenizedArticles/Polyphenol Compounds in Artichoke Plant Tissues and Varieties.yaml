text: ['Abstract:  Polyphenol compounds, particularly caffeoylquinic acids and flavonoids,
    were measured in different tissues and developmental stages of  6 artichoke varietal
    types diffused in the Mediterranean region.', 'Flower heads were subdivided into
    external, intermediate, internal bracts, and receptacle, while leaves were collected
    at the vegetative and productive stages.', 'The main polyphenols detected were
    chlorogenic acid, cynarin, luteolin 7-O-rutinoside, and luteolin 7-O-glucoside.',
  Violet de Provence artichoke proved to retain the highest content of total phenols.,
  Single polyphenols accumulated preferentially in specific parts of capitula., 'In
    leaves, most polyphenols were detected in the productive stage of the plant.',
  'Altogether, results provide useful indications for the promotion of artichoke as
    nutraceutical food and for the extraction of health-promoting substances in particular
    tissues/stages of the artichoke plant.', 'Practical Application:  We describe
    the content of phenolic compounds in various artichoke tissues, developmental
    stages, and varieties.', 'Results indicate that artichoke leaves represent an
    important source of these health-promoting compounds, also useful for phytopharmaceutical
    applications.', 'A wider utilization of specific artichoke types should be strongly
    encouraged not only as a food for the fresh market, as they are now used, but
    also for the pharmaceutical industry, since the content of phenolic compounds
    is abundant both in the heads and in the leaves.', 'Globe artichoke is a crop
    belonging to the Asteraceae family, originating from the Mediterranean region
    where it is traditionally cultivated and commonly consumed as a vegetable.', It
    is known since ancient times as a food and a remedy in medicine., 'As a vegetable,
    globe artichoke plays an important role in human nutrition, especially nowadays
    that the Mediterranean diet has been recognized as the intangible Cultural Heritage
    of Humanity.', 'This crop contributes significantly to the agricultural economy
    of the Mediterranean area, with an annual production of about 770000 tonnes  from
    over 80 kha of cultivated land.', 'Italy is the leading world producer, followed
    by Spain and France.', 'Artichoke is also cultivated in the Near East, North Africa,
    South America, and the United States, and its cultivation is spreading in China.',
  'Artichoke flower heads  are immature composite inflorescences, including the edible
    part of the plant used worldwide as a fresh, frozen, or canned foodstuff.', 'Leaf
    extracts have been widely used in herbal medicine as hepatoprotectors and choleretics,
    and also possess anticarcinogenic, anti-HIV, antioxidative, diuretic, as well
    as antifungal and antibacterial properties.', 'The beneficial effects of artichoke
    plant on human health are mainly due to flavonoids and phenolic acids, particularly
    caffeic acid and its derivatives mono and dicaffeoylquinic acids.', These compounds
    have been demonstrated to be bioavailable to humans in their diet., 'Moreover,
    artichoke industrial by-products  represent about 80% of the biomass and may be
    used as raw material for the extraction of food additives and antioxidants, while
    the lignocellulose biomass may provide green forage for livestock and may serve
    as an energy crop.', Many studies have focused on artichoke antioxidant properties
    but few of these are related to the abundance of the polyphenolic fractions in
    head parts or in various developmental stages of the plant., 'Italy possesses
    the richest globe artichoke primary cultivated gene pool and harbors many distinct
    landraces, best adapted to different local environments and, from an agronomical
    point of view, each region preserves its peculiar local varieties which may differ
    in morphological traits and chemical composition and, therefore, may exhibit different
    bioactive properties.', 'Despite the variation present in the cultivated Italian
    germplasm, the number of varietal types with market value is limited to just a
    few.', 'In addition, the recent introduction of non-autochthonous and seed-propagated
    varieties is leading to a progressive erosion of local ecotypes; a similar issue
    can also be referred to local accessions of other European nations.', This article
    deals with the chemical characterization of 6 traditionally cultivated varietal
    types of artichoke., 'The phenolic composition was analyzed in various plant parts:
    leaves collected in different developmental stages and the edible head subdivided
    in external, intermediate, internal bracts, and receptacle.', 'The aim was to
    acquire information on the accumulation on polyphenol fractions in artichoke plant
    tissues, to help identify strategies for promoting the use of autochthonous globe
    artichoke genetic resources rich in health-promoting compounds.', Six globe artichoke
    varietal types were selected., 'Four of them, namely Mola,Tondo di Paestum,SantErasmo,
    and Bianco di Ostuni are Italian traditional local varieties, well adapted to
    the environment of cultivation areas, and particularly Tondo di Paestum was appointed
    the protected geographic indication  European mark.', 'Blanca de Tudela is widely
    cultivated in Spain, and Violet de Provence is largely diffused in southern France
    and Italy.', This material was also selected on the basis of flowering time and
    flower head color., 'Mola,Blanca de Tudela, and Violet de Provence are early,
    while the others are late varieties; Bianco di Ostuni and Blanca de Tudela possess
    green capitula, Mola and Violet de Provence have flower heads colored in green
    with purple veins, whereas SantErasmo and Tondo di Paestum are purple varieties.',
  The plant material was arranged adopting a planting density of 1.3 plant m2., The
    collection was grown at the experimental field of the Inst., 'of Plant Genetics
    at Policoro, Italy.', 'The field is situated around 15 m above sea level  and
    is characterized by a subdamp climate, according to the De Martonne classification.',
  'The principal chemical-physics characteristics of the soil are: sand 40%, slime
    37.1%, clay 22.9%, pH 7.7, total N  1.67%, available P2O5  26.7 ppm, K2O of exchange  227
    ppm, organic substance  3.64%, total limestone 1.5%, active limestone 0.5%; ECe
    0.95 dS m-1, ESP 1.9%, density 1.25 kg/dm3.', 'Irrigation, plant protection, and
    weed control were carried out according to local practices.', 'Since the early
    vegetative plant stages, different plant parts were collected for each genotype:
    young expanded leaves, vegetative leaves, and basal and apical productive leaves,
    obtained from the plant when the main head was at commercial maturity.', 'From
    heads, harvested at commercial maturity, ExB, ImB, InB, and Recs were manually
    separated and immediately frozen at -20 C.


    Tissues were collected for 2 y  on 3 plants for each of the 6 varietal types considered
    in this study.', Solvents were purchased from J.T., Baker  and were of analytical
    or high-performance liquid chromatography  grade., Deionized water was used for
    all the analyses., '5-O-caffeoylquinic acid, caffeic acid, apigenin 7-O-glucoside,
    and luteolin 7-O-glucoside  were obtained from Extrasynthese ; 1,3-di-O-caffeoylquinic
    acid  and 1,5-di-O-caffeoylquinic acid  were from ChromaDex Inc.. Formic acid
    and HPLC grade water were purchased from J.T.', Baker., LC-MS grade solvent acetonitrile
    was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich., 'Polyphenol extraction was performed according
    to the method of Fratianni and others, with some modifications.', 'Briefly, 0.5
    g of each sample were incubated for 1 h at 4 C in 5 volumes of acetone:ethanol:methanol.',
  The supernatant was collected and the residue was resuspended in 5 volumes of ethyl
    acetate and incubated at 4 C for 1 h. The 2 supernatants were separately concentrated
    to dryness in a Rotavapor 144 R  and resuspended in methyl alcohol before being
    pooled together and subjected to polyphenol characterization., 'Polyphenols were
    extracted from the tissues mentioned previously, and the analyses were repeated
    for 2 y.


    HPLC analyses were carried out with a Beckman-Coulter  HPLC System Gold chromatograph
    equipped with a DAD  programmable detector  operated by a 32 Karat software package.',
  A reversed phase column Luna C18  was employed., 'The following gradient system
    was used with water  and 95% acetonitrile : 0 min, 90% A and 10% B; 30 min, 50%
    A and 50% B; 35 min, 0% A and 100% B.', 'Analyses were stopped after 47 min, the
    eluent was brought back to the initial composition within next 2 min, whereas
    the equilibration time set to stabilize the column was 10 min.', 'The flow was
    maintained at 1 mL/min and the injection volume was 10 L. Diode array detection
    was between 200 and 600 nm, and absorbance was recorded at 280, 310, and 350 nm.',
  'Compound identification was achieved by combining different information: positions
    of absorption maxima, retention times, mass spectra, and the corresponding daughter
    MS/MS fragments were compared with those from pure standards and/or interpreted
    with the help of structural models already hypothesized in the literature.', 'Quantification
    was made using 6 points  calibration curves standards of 5-O-caffeoylquinic acid,
    1,3-di-O-caffeoylquinic acid, 1,5-di-O-caffeoylquinic acid, caffeic acid, apigenin
    7-O-glucoside, luteolin 7-O-glucoside, with R2 values ranging between 0.9997 and
    0.9999.', Monocaffeoylquinic acids were calculated as CGA., 'Apigenin and luteolin
    derivatives were calculated as apigenin 7-O-glucoside and luteolin 7-O-glucoside,
    respectively.', 'The high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detection-electrospray
    ionization tandem mass spectrometry  system consisted of a capillary HPLC 1290
    Infinity  equipped with a binary pump solvent delivery, thermostatic column compartment,
    diode array detector, and a QQQ 6410 mass detector  coupled with a pneumatic nebulizer-assisted
    electrospray LC-MS interface.', 'A Poroshell column 120 EC-C18  was used, with
    a precolumn Gemini C18.', 'The following gradient system was used with acetonitrile  and
    water/formic acid  : 0 min, 5% A and 95% B; 10 min, 13% A and 87% B; 20 min, 15%
    A and 85% B; 30 min, 22% A and 78% B; 50 min 22% A and 78% B; 55 min 5% A and
    95% B; stop time to 70 min.', 'The flow was maintained at 0.2 mL/min; sample injection
    was 3 L. Diode array detection was between 200 and 600 nm, and absorbances were
    simultaneously recorded at 350 nm, 330 nm, 320 nm, and 280 nm.', Negative electrospray
    mode was used for ionization of molecules with capillary voltage at 4000 V. The
    fragmentor voltage was 140 V and the collision voltage was 15 V. Nitrogen was
    used both as drying gas at a flow rate of 9 L/min and as nebulizing gas at a pressure
    of 40 psi., 'Temperature of drying gas was 350 C. In the full scan  and product
    ion  modes, the monitored mass range was from m/z 100 to 1200.', 'Typically, 2
    runs were performed during the HPLC-ESI-MS analysis of each sample.', 'First,
    an MS full-scan acquisition was performed to obtain preliminary information on
    the predominant m/z ratios observed during the elution.', 'An MS/MS full-scan
    acquisition was then performed: Quadrupole 1 filtered the calculated m/z of each
    compound of interest, while Quadrupole 3 scanned for ions produced by nitrogen
    collision of these ionized compounds in the chosen range at a scan time of 500
    ms/cycle.', All data were acquired and processed using Mass Hunter software.,
  Analyses were performed in triplicate., All data were subjected to the analysis
    of variance adopting the General Linear Model for balanced design that provides
    information about the relationships between categorical predictor variables and
    response dependent variables., 'The design is hierarchically nested, because there
    is a hierarchy of nested factors with consecutive levels: the units of the 1st
    level  are nested within the units of the 2nd level  and so the units of the 2nd
    level are nested within the units of the 3rd level.', Then the model ends up crossed
    with another variable., The analyses were conducted separately on parts of artichoke
    head and on leaves., 'When the F-test was significant, means were separated by
    Student-Newman-Keuls or Duncan test.', All calculation and statistical analyses
    were performed using the appropriate options of Statistica version 7.1 package.,
  All data presented are mean values of 6 independent experiments  and are expressed
    as mg/kg of fresh matter., The study provides a qualitative and quantitative evaluation
    of the phenolic profile for 6 artichoke varietal types cultivated in the Mediterranean
    area., 'Polyphenols were measured for 3 bract orders, and for the Rec of main
    flower heads at commercial maturity and in leaves at different developmental stages.',
  'After HPLC separation, 14 compounds were identified, belonging to hydroxycinnamate
    and flavone groups.', Identification of some acid compounds  and flavonoids  was
    based on the comparison of their UV spectra and retention times with those of
    reference substances., 'However, HPLC coupled to mass spectrometry was also used
    to confirm peak assignment and further characterization of individual substances
    for all compounds.', 'Mass spectrometric behavior  was identified on the basis
    of pseudomolecular ion or fragmentation patterns in the MS and by comparing the
    elution order with that reported in the literature; in accordance with the methods
    of Sanchez-Rabaneda and others, Schutz and others, and Romani and others, all
    the qualitative profiles were identified in each artichoke head part and leaf
    type.', Figure 1-., Separation of caffeoylquinic acids and flavonoids in artichoke
    extracts by HPLC., For peak assignment see Table 1., 'As shown in Table 2 and
    4, the total phenolic content, calculated as the sum of individual phenolic compounds,
    varied significantly between genotype  and plant parts, and on average was higher
    in leaves than in heads, in accordance with the method of Wang and others.', 'Among
    the landraces studied, Violet de Provence displayed the highest total amount of
    phenolics in both capitula and in leaves, followed by Mola and Tondo di Paestum,
    which contained similar amounts of total polyphenols in capitula, and in leaves  in
    accordance with the method of Bonasia and others  and Lombardo and others, who
    state that the content of total polyphenols in Violet de Provence is one of the
    highest among the varieties studied.', 'The landraces with the lowest content
    of total polyphenols in heads was Bianco di Ostuni, while in leaves was SantErasmo.',
  'When parts of the flower head were considered, total polyphenols increased on average
    from ExB  to ImB  and InB, and were quite high also in the Rec.', 'As for leaves,
    Table 3 and 4 show that total measured polyphenols varied significantly  in different
    developmental stages of plant leaves: in general, they increased from the vegetative
    to the productive stage.', 'During the vegetative period of the plant, an increase
    in polyphenol content could be observed from YL to VeL.', 'In the reproductive
    period, PrAL showed a higher amount  of total polyphenols compared to PrBL.',
  These data might suggest that a high content of polyphenols in the flower head is
    ensured either by a de novo synthesis of these compounds or by transport from
    bottom to top of the plant., 'Details on phenolic content in all bract orders,
    Rec, and leaves are given in Table S1 to S8.', 'Among the hydroxycinnamic acids
    detected, the main compounds were CGA and its derivative cynarin, which are synthesized
    by the plant both in heads and leaves.', 'In particular, cynarin content ranged
    from a minimum of 2655.90 mg/kg FM  to 6832.84 mg/kg FM  in leaves, and from 11053.11  to
    28787.87 mg/kg FM  in heads.', Also CGA showed higher levels in heads  than in
    leaves., 'In agreement with Schutz and others, these compounds were mainly present
    in InB.', They are typical of artichoke and are important for their choleretic  and
    antioxidant  activity., 'Furthermore, in vivo studies have demonstrated the anticarcinogenic
    properties of CGA, that can be absorbed directly by the small intestine or hydrolyzed
    by the microflora of the large intestine to release caffeic acid, which shows
    the same antioxidant activity as CGA.', The high level of CGA found in artichoke
    could be explained by its central role as a substrate for biochemical reactions
    producing several phenolic acids., 'In our study, we observed considerable decrease
    of hydroxycinnamic acids, in all genotypes, from InB  to ExB  in accordance with
    the method of Pandino and others.', 'Polyphenols, and particularly hydroxycinnamates,
    play significant roles in lignification in plants, and are implicated in cell
    wall polymer cross-linking.', 'It can be, therefore, hypothesized that the reduced
    amount of these compounds in ExB might be due to the fact that metabolic flux
    is directed toward the synthesis of lignin.', 'ExB, in fact, contain lignified
    tissues, and protect the reproductive organs of the plant against biotic and abiotic
    stresses.', 'Among flavonoids, luteolin derivatives were the most abundant.',
  The discrepancy with Pandino and others  results might be explained by the different
    extraction methods adopted and/or by the different varietal types of artichoke
    studied., 'Particularly, the content of luteolin-7-O-rutinoside was very high
    in capitula of most artichoke varieties, mainly in Violet de Provence, except
    for ExB.', 'Also, this compound increased on average from external to internal
    parts of the flower head, while a lower content was observed in leaves, where
    it was especially present in the VeL and PrAL.', 'Luteolin-7-O-glucoside was very
    abundant in leaves of all artichoke genotypes, especially in the productive stage.',
  'Again, Violet de Provence showed the highest amount of this luteolin derivative
    in each developmental stage, with a mean value of 69658.27 mg/kg FM in leaves.',
  The content of apigenin derivatives had an inverse trend compared to other compounds.,
  'As for leaves, the vegetative stage was richer than the productive one.', 'Blanca
    de Tudela showed very low values, while the richest accession was Mola.', 'In
    flower head, apigenin derivative content decreased from ExB to InB and, in the
    Rec, it was comparable to ImB bracts.', Apigenin-7-O-glucuronide was the most
    abundant apigenin derivative., 'In accordance with the method of Romani and others,
    it is interesting to underline that leaves contain the highest amount of flavonoids;
    as for capitula, more modest values were found in the bracts, and higher quantities
    in the Rec.', 'Flavones exhibit potent biological effects in vitro and in vivo,
    such as inhibition of UV-induced skin carcinogenesis, vasomodulating, antioxidant,
    and antimicrobial properties.', 'Luteolin, one of the most common flavones, is
    thought to play an important role for human health as an antioxidant, a free radical
    scavenger, an agent in the prevention of inflammation and cancer, a promoter of
    carbohydrate metabolism, and an immune system modulator.', 'When considering the
    influence of the year and the plants in the varietal types, no significant difference
    was observed on polyphenol content.', 'It is known that the amount of polyphenolics
    and antioxidant activities in plants is influenced by biological factors, as well
    as edaphic and environmental  conditions.', 'Our results suggest that for artichoke,
    polyphenol content mainly depends on the genotype and part of the plants.', 'It
    has to be noted that, while the VeL were collected in the same period for all
    genotypes, the main flower head was collected at commercial maturity, and therefore,
    in a different period for early and late flowering varieties, respectively.',
  'Therefore, an influence of environment has to be also considered.', 'In any case,
    the high content of some potent antioxidants in artichoke substantiates the thought
    that this vegetable represents an important source of polyphenols with antioxidant
    and therapeutic activity, particularly in phytopharmaceutical applications.',
  'The edible parts are very rich in caffeoylquinic acids and in some luteolin derivatives,
    and therefore, constitute a valid source of healthy compounds through direct consumption.',
  'However, leaves still retain a high level of 1,5-di-O-caffeoylquinic acid and,
    especially, luteolin 7-O-glucoside.', These compounds are particularly abundant
    in the top leaves during the productive period., 'These results provide useful
    indications on the bioactive value of some artichoke varieties and for the extraction
    of health-promoting substances in particular stages of the plant, exploiting both
    the commercially valuable heads and the leaves.', The phenolic profile in heads
    and leaves at different developmental stages was investigated in 6 artichoke varieties.,
  Single polyphenols accumulated preferentially in specific parts of the heads and
    leaves and in particular stages of the plant growing cycle., 'Total polyphenols
    were more abundant in leaves than in heads, indicating that artichoke leaves represent
    an important source of health-promoting compounds, useful for phytopharmaceutical
    applications.', 'Cynarin and CGA were the most abundant hydroxycinnammates, while
    luteolin derivatives were the most abundant flavonols.', Violet de Provence artichoke
    proved to retain the highest content of total phenols., 'A wider utilization of
    this and other artichoke types should be strongly encouraged for the pharmaceutical
    industry and not solely for the fresh market, as they are now used.', 'This research
    was supported by EU Cynares Project--Agr Gen Res 063 and by a grant from the Italian
    Ministry of Economy and Finance to CNR and ENEA for the project Innovazione e
