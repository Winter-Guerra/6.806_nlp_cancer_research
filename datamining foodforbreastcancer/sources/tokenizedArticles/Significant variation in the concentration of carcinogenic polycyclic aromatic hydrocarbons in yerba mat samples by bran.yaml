text: ['Drinking mat, common in southern South America, may increase the risk of esophageal
    squamous cell carcinoma.', 'In 2006, we found high but variable polycyclic aromatic
    hydrocarbon  content in commercial yerba mat samples from eight Brazilian brands.',
  'The PAH content of new samples from the same brands, purchased in 2008, and four
    brands from a single manufacturer processed in different ways, obtained in 2010,
    were quantified to determine whether PAH concentration was still high, whether
    PAH content variation was brand specific, and whether processing method affects
    PAH content of commercial yerba mat.', Concentrations of individual PAHs were
    quantified using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry with deuterated PAHs as
    internal standards., 'Median total PAH concentration was 1500 ng/g  and 1090 ng/g  in
    2008 and 2010 samples, respectively.', 'Comparing 2006 and 2008 samples, some
    brands had high PAH concentrations in both years, while PAH concentration changed
    considerably in others.', 'Benzopyrene concentrations ranged from 11.9 to 99.3
    ng/g and 5.11 to 21.0 ng/g in 2008 and 2010 samples, respectively.', The 2010
    sample processed without touching smoke had the lowest benzopyrene content., 'These
    results support previous findings of very high total and carcinogenic PAH concentrations
    in yerba mat, perhaps contributing to the high incidence of ESCC in southern South
    America.', 'The large PAH content variation by brand, batch, and processing method
    suggests it may be possible to reduce the content of carcinogenic PAHs in commercial
    yerba mat, making it a healthier beverage.', 'Esophageal cancer, the sixth most
    common cause of cancer death in the world, has a striking geographical variation
    in both incidence and mortality.', 'Southern South America, including Uruguay,
    Paraguay, southern Brazil, and northern Argentina, is one of the areas with high
    incidence rates of EC.', 'This geographic clustering suggests that some environmental
    factors and/or habits specific to this area are risk factors for esophageal squamous
    cell carcinoma, the dominant histological type of EC in South America.', 'Previous
    research has shown that in addition to alcohol consumption and tobacco smoking,
    which are known to cause ESCC in many parts of the world, drinking mat, a habit
    common to southern South America, may also increase risk of ESCC.Mat is a drink
    prepared from dried leaves of the plant yerba mat, and it is consumed in high
    quantities by many people in this region.', The average per capita annual consumption
    of processed yerba mat leaves in this region has been estimated to be between
    5 and 8 kg., 'While a causal link between mat drinking and ESCC is not yet certain,
    it is highly probable.', 'A number of studies have shown a consistent association
    between amount, duration, and temperature of mat consumption and risk of ESCC.',
  'Two plausible mechanisms proposed for the carcinogenecity of mat are chronic mucosal
    irritation due to repeated thermal injury after drinking hot mat, and exposure
    to carcinogenic components of the drink, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.',
  We focus on the latter mechanism in this paper., 'PAHs are compounds produced during
    incomplete combustion of organic materials, including tobacco and coal.', PAH
    exposure has been shown to be high in a number of areas with very high rates of
    ESCC., 'Humans may be exposed to PAHs in many ways, including inhalation of tobacco
    smoke, exposure to air pollution, eating foods cooked at high temperature, jobs
    such as coal mining, and therapeutic use of coal tar.', 'Of these, smoking tobacco
    is the most common major source of PAH exposure.', 'Recent evidence shows that
    mat drinking may also be a major source of PAH exposure, possibly causing as much
    exposure as smoking tobacco.Yerba mat leaves undergo several processing steps
    before they are sold commercially, including slow drying using wood smoke.', 'The
    drying process, which takes approximately 824 h, can result in high concentrations
    of PAHs in commercial yerba mat.', 'A study by our group in Brazil showed that
    consuming mat led to a strong dose-dependent increase in the urine concentration
    of 1-hydroxypyrene glucuronide, a stable metabolite of PAHs.', 'In a second study,
    we measured the concentrations of 21 PAHs in the leaves of 8 commercial yerba
    mat brands and in hot and cold mat extracted from two of these brands, and we
    found very high PAH concentrations in all of the leaf and beverage samples.',
  'Of special interest, we found up to a 4-fold variation among brands in the PAH
    content of the yerba mat leaves.', 'This variation may be of public health importance,
    because if PAHs are responsible for the increased risk of ESCC associated with
    mat drinking, then it may be possible to reduce the cancer risk by processing
    yerba mat in ways that result in a lower PAH content.', 'As a follow-up to this
    second study, we purchased new samples of the same brands of yerba mat and repeated
    the PAH measurements to substantiate our previous findings of high concentrations
    and variation of PAHs in yerba mat and to learn whether the differences in PAH
    content were brand-specific or they simply reflected batch-to-batch variation
    within each brand.', 'In addition, we obtained four different brands of yerba
    mat that were made by the same company but processed in different ways, including
    one brand that was never exposed to smoke during the processing of the yerba mat
    leaves, to see if such different processing methods might affect the PAH content
    of the commercial product.', 'In our previous study in 2006, we purchased eight
    packaged commercial brands of yerba mat in Santa Maria, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil,
    and measured 21 individual PAHs in the dry yerba mat leaves.', 'In 2008 we purchased
    new loose  samples of the same 8 yerba mat brands from a market in Porto Alegre,
    RS, and quantified the concentrations of 26 individual PAHs.', 'In 2010 we obtained
    four additional packaged commercial brands of yerba mat leaves from one of the
    major yerba mat manufacturers, with a request to test these brands for PAH content.',
  Three of these brands were processed in the traditional way  and one was processed
    in an alternative way in which the leaves were never exposed to smoke., 'In these
    four brands, we quantified the concentrations of 22 individual PAHs.', 'Of the
    individual PAHs measured in the 2006, 2008, and 2010 samples, 20 were the same
    among the three studies, and the rest were study specific.', All measurements
    were performed in the Analytical Chemistry Division of the National Institute
    of Standards and Technology  using the same validated methods used for the 2006
    samples., 'Standard Reference Materials  2260a Aromatic Hydrocarbons in Toluene,
    SRM 2269 Perdeuterated PAH-I, SRM 2270 Perdeuterated PAH-II, and SRM 1649a Urban
    Dust were obtained from the Standard Reference Materials Group, NIST.', One subsample  from
    each brand of yerba mat from the 2008 samples or 3 subsamples  from the 2010 yerba
    mat samples and one subsample  from one bottle of SRM 1649a were put into pressurized
    fluid extraction  cells containing hydromatrix  and mixed with the hydromatrix.,
  Hydromatrix was then used to fill the void space of the cells., A solution prepared
    from diluting SRM 2269 and SRM 2270 was added to each extraction vessel for use
    as the internal standard solution., 'The fact that only one subsample was tested
    from each of the 2008 samples was a limitation of the study, but this was unlikely
    to have affected our overall findings.', 'Because some fine yerba mat particles
    came through with the extract, the entire extract  was eluted through a silica
    plus Sep Pak column  that was preconditioned with 20% dichloromethane in hexane  for
    the 2008 samples or 10%  for the 2010 samples.', The yerba mat extract was then
    eluted from the Sep Pak using 20 mL of the same solvent mixture., The eluents
    from the Sep Pak were concentrated to approximately 0.5 mL using an automated
    evaporation system prior to gas chromatography/mass spectrometry  analysis., 'The
    column used for the GC/MS analysis was a 0.25 mm  60 m fused silica capillary
    column containing a 50% phenyl methyl-substituted polysiloxane phase, 0.25 m film
    thickness.', All injections were done on-column  with helium as a carrier gas
    at a constant flow rate of 1.2 mL/min., A calibration curve bracketing the concentrations
    in the yerba mat samples  was determined for each analyte of interest by linear
    regression of response data from gravimetrically diluted solutions of SRM 2260a
    mixed with the internal standard solution., 'These calibration solutions, as well
    as the blank extract, were taken through the entire procedure.', All PAH concentrations
    were rounded to three significant figures., 'For each of the measured PAHs, median
    concentrations were calculated separately for the samples purchased in 2008 and
    for the samples obtained in 2010.', Pairwise Spearman correlation coefficients
    were calculated to compare the distribution of PAH concentrations in different
    brands., This analysis was done to examine whether there was a consistent pattern
    in the PAH concentrations of processed yerba mat., 'All analyses were done using
    Stata, version 11.', Two-sided p-values less than 0.05 were considered as statistically
    significant., The concentrations of the 20 PAHs analyzed in both the 2008 and
    2010 samples are shown in Table 1., 'The median concentration of these 20 PAHs
    in the yerba mat samples purchased in 2008 was 1500 ng/g, with a range from 625
    to 3710 ng/g.', 'In the 2010 samples, the median concentration was 1090 ng/g,
    and the range was from 621 to 1990 ng/g.', The concentration of the carcinogenic
    PAH benzopyrene ranged from 11.9 to 99.3 ng/g in the 2008 samples and from 5.11
    to 21.0 ng/g in the 2010 samples., The lowest concentration of benzopyrene was
    found in the Brand A brand of the 2010 samples., 'The concentrations of total
    PAHs in the Brand C and Brand D brands of the 2010 samples were in the same range
    as most of the brands in 2006 and 2008, while the Brand A and Brand B brands appeared
    to be similar to the low-PAH brands in the previous series.', Table 1., "Concentrations
    \ of the 20 PAHs in All Samples of the Commercial Brands of Yerba Mat Leaves Purchased
    in 2008 and 2010a  \n\nThe concentrations of the 20 PAHs are given in 16 rows
    because the concentrations of phenanthrene and anthracene were reported together,
    the concentrations of triphenylene and chrysene were reported together, and the
    concentrations of benzofluoranthene, benzofluoranthene, and benzofluoranthene
    were reported together as benzofluoranthene.", 'ND, not detected.', Figure 1.,
  'Total PAH concentrations in the 2006, 2008, and 2010 yerba mat samples.', There
    was a strong and statistically significant positive pairwise correlation in the
    distribution of individual PAH concentrations between each two of the twelve brands
    purchased in 2008 and 2010., This indicates that the relative content of the individual
    PAHs in different mat brands was similar., 'For example, in the 2008 samples,
    benzopyrene made up approximately 2%, fluoranthene 14%, and phenanthrene 27%  of
    the overall PAH content in all brands.', 'These results suggest that  we can measure
    a limited number of PAHs, e.g., 2 or 3, rather than 20, to obtain a good measure
    of the total PAH content of mat; and  the PAH content of mat may have one main
    source, which produces a similar distribution of PAHs.', Table 2., "Pairwise Correlations
    of the Distribution of the PAHs in the 2008 and 2010 Yerba Mat Samplesa  \n\nThe
    P-value for all the Spearman correlations was less than 0.01 except for the correlation
    between brand D and brand 6 and 7.", 'To evaluate batch-to-batch variation of
    the same eight yerba mat brands in 2006 and 2008, we compared the absolute values
    of the total PAH concentrations of the 20 PAHs that were measured in both years.',
  Some brands had high or low total PAH concentrations in both years., 'For example,
    Brand 6 had the second highest concentration of PAHs in both 2006 and 2008.',
  Brand 8 had relatively low concentrations and ranked seventh in both years., 'However,
    some brands changed considerably in their rank.', 'For example, Brand 1, which
    had the highest concentration of PAHs in 2006, ranked sixth in 2008.', 'Conversely,
    Brand 5, which had the lowest concentration of PAHs in 2006, had one of the higher
    concentrations of PAHs in the 2008 samples.', 'Examining individual PAHs, we also
    found high batch-to-batch variation in six of the eight brands, with some having
    higher and some having lower concentrations in the new samples.', 'For example,
    benzopyrene concentrations in the 2006 and 2008 samples were 50.0 and 18.9 ng/g
    for Brand 1, and 52.5 and 99.3 ng/g for Brand 4.', Figure 2., 'Benzopyrene concentration
    in the 2006, 2008, and 2010 yerba mat samples.', The dashed line shows the benzopyrene
    content of the yerba mat brand that never touched smoke., 'The lowest concentration
    of benzopyrene in any of the yerba mat samples, 5.11 ng/g, was found in the 2010
    brand which was processed without ever touching smoke.', 'Figure 2 shows the concentrations
    of benzopyrene in the 2006, 2008, and 2010 yerba mat samples, with the horizontal
    line denoting the benzopyrene concentration of the brand prepared without touching
    smoke.', 'Our analysis of the commercial yerba mat samples purchased in 2008 and
    2010 supports our previous findings of very high total and carcinogenic PAH concentrations
    in most commercial yerba mat, and shows again that there is a consistent pattern
    to the distribution of the PAHs present in the leaves.', 'Comparing the 2006 and
    2008 samples, we observed relatively large batch-to-batch differences in most
    brands.', 'And in the 2010 samples, we saw differences in PAH concentrations made
    by the same company but processed in different ways.', 'PAH contamination of yerba
    mat may come from several sources, including environmental pollution, but probably
    the most important source is the traditional way of drying the leaves, during
    which the leaves are smoked.', 'PAH contamination of other foods can happen during
    preparation, and it has been shown that yerba mat leaves acquire PAHs during the
    drying process.', 'Of all of the yerba mat samples tested in all three years,
    the concentration of benzopyrene was the lowest in the 2010 brand that had never
    touched smoke during the drying process, suggesting that this method of processing
    may be a promising one for reducing the PAH content of commercial yerba mat.',
  The high PAH content found in yerba mat leaves in this study and in our previous
    study supports a role for PAHs in the etiology of ESCC., 'The IARC working group
    on the evaluation of carcinogenic risks to humans has classified benzopyrene as
    carcinogenic to humans, and exposure to this carcinogenic PAH has been shown to
    be high in several high-risk areas for ESCC.', 'Furthermore, we have previously
    shown that the usual practice of repeated infusions of the same yerba mat leaves
    can elute more than 50% of the benzopyrene content of the leaves into either hot
    or cold mat drinks.', 'In southern Brazil, mat is traditionally prepared and drunk
    in gourds called cuias.', 'These cuias usually hold 100200 mL of liquid, and are
    filled with yerba mat leaves up to two-thirds of their volume, about 50100 g of
    leaves.', The 16 traditional yerba mat brands that we analyzed in 2006 and 2008
    had a median benzopyrene concentration of 40.1 ng/g of leaves., 'If we round this
    to 40 ng/g and assume an average use of 50 g of leaves per cuia and a 50% elution
    of the benzopyrene from the leaves into the fluid, then drinking an average cuia
    of mat in the traditional way would expose the consumer to 40 ng/g  50 g  0.5
    elution = 1000 ng of benzopyrene, equivalent to the benzopyrene content of the
    smoke from 100 cigarettes.', 'In contrast, if the benzopyrene concentration of
    the yerba mat leaves was equal to that of the 2010 brand that never touched smoke,
    approximately 5 ng/g of leaves, then drinking the same cuia in the same way would
    expose the consumer to 5 ng/g  50 g  0.5 elution = 125 ng of benzopyrene, equivalent
    to the benzopyrene content of the smoke from 12.5 cigarettes.', 'One must be cautious,
    however, in implying similar biological effects from similar amounts of external
    PAH exposure from mat drinking and cigarette smoking, since the internal exposure
    of this intake may differ by the route of administration.', 'It is possible that
    gastric absorption may be less efficient, and thus the biological effect per ng
    of gastric exposure may be less.', 'This possibility is supported by the fact
    that in the same population, urinary 1-OHPG, a valid short-term marker of total
    internal PAH exposure, has been shown to be almost equal between cigarette smokers  who
    do not drink mat and mat drinkers  who do not smoke cigarettes.', 'But whatever
    the exact equivalency, a substantial reduction in external PAH exposure from any
    source will most likely be beneficial to individual and public health.', 'Given
    the high prevalence of mat consumption in certain areas of South America, the
    population-attributable fraction of ESCC due to mat drinking has been estimated
    to range from 10% to 79%, which implies that reducing consumption or reducing
    the carcinogens in it could potentially lead to a substantial decrease in the
    burden of ESCC.', 'While implementing strategies to eliminate mat drinking in
    this region may not be feasible, diminishing the carcinogenic content of this
    common exposure would be a plausible preventive approach.', 'Diminishing the PAH
    content of mat could also reduce other adverse effects of PAH exposure, including
    its effects on cardiovascular diseases.', We observed large differences in PAH
    concentrations between brands and within each brand of yerba mat over time., 'This
    is not surprising, since it is difficult to control the exact amount of smoke
    to which the yerba mat leaves are exposed during the traditional drying process.',
  'But these differences by brand and batch suggest that very high PAH content is
    probably not essential for marketing yerba mat, so it may be possible to reduce
    the PAH content of processed yerba mat without significantly affecting its quality
    or marketability.', The lower levels of total PAH and carcinogenic benzopyrene
    in the commercial yerba mat brand that had not been exposed to smoke are consistent
    with this hypothesis., 'It is probable that most commercial mat producers, along
    with the general public, have not been aware that mat drinking currently has health
    risks as well as health benefits, and that at least some of these risks might
    be avoided if the drying methods were changed.', 'It is also possible that there
    may be a difference in taste after different processing methods, which may make
    long-time mat drinkers not want to switch to a smokeless brand, but this has not
    yet been evaluated.', The best solution would be to find processing methods that
    could significantly reduce PAH exposure and still keep optimal taste., 'In summary,
    the results of this study confirm high concentrations of total and carcinogenic
    PAHs in most commercial yerba mat leaves, and suggest that these concentrations
    may possibly be reduced by altering the processing of the leaves.', Reducing the
    PAH content of commercial yerba mat is a sensible precaution which will probably
    make mat a healthier beverage., 'Given the popular use of mat, the public health
    impact of such a reduction could be significant.', 'This study was supported in
    part by funds from the intramural program of the National Cancer Institute, NIH
    and in part by an interagency agreement between the NIH and the National Institute
    of Standards and Technology.']
title: Significant variation in the concentration of carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic
  hydrocarbons in yerba mat samples by brand, batch and processing method
