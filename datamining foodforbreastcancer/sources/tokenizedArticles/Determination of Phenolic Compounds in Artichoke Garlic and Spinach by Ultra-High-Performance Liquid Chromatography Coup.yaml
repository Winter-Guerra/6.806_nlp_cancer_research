text: ['Phenolic compounds were determined in artichoke, garlic  and spinach  using
    a single method based on simple extraction and ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography
    coupled to triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry.', 'Several compounds belonging
    to different families, such as phenolic acids, isoflavones, flavones and flavonols,
    were determined.', 'The analytical procedure was validated in all the matrices,
    obtaining recoveries ranging from 60 to 120 % with reproducibility values ) lower
    than 26 %.', 'Limits of quantification  were always equal to or lower than 50
    g/kg, except to kaempferol and its glucosides in spinach.', Artichoke showed higher
    concentration of phenolic compounds ) than garlic  or spinach., 'Apigenin 7-O-glucoside  was
    found to be the major flavonoid in all samples of artichoke investigated, while
    chlorogenic acid, whose concentration ranged from 37.8 to 734.7 mg/kg DW, is the
    major phenolic acid in this matrix.', 'Regarding garlic, caffeic acid  and quercetin  were
    the compounds detected at higher concentrations, although in general the total
    content was very low in relation to other matrices.', 'In relation to spinach,
    ferulic acid was the major phenolic compound, and its concentration ranged from
    18.0 to 41.4 mg/kg DW.', Recent evidence from the PREDIMED  study confirms the
    relationship between Mediterranean diet and health., 'The health-promoting effects
    of this diet have been mainly attributed to a high intake of fruit, vegetables,
    olive oil, nuts, and cereals; a moderate intake of fish, poultry and wine; and
    a low intake of dairy products, meat and sweets.', 'Some vegetables, such as artichoke,
    spinach  and garlic, are important because their composition and high consumption
    and their worldwide production are 1.5, 20 and 23 million tonnes in 2013 respectively.',
  These vegetables are highly valued among consumers due to their flavour and health-promoting
    effects., 'Recent studies have demonstrated that artichoke, garlic and spinach
    have high medicinal benefits, such as antioxidant, anticarcinogenic, cholesterol-lowering,
    hepatoprotective, antidiabetic  and anti-inflammatory properties, which have been
    mainly attributed to the presence of phenolic compounds in these matrices.', 'Phenolic
    compounds, such as chlorogenic acid ) and luteolin glycosides, have been reported
    as the bioactive compounds detected at the highest concentrations in artichoke.',
  'In relation to garlic, myricetin, apigenin or quercetin were detected in Malaysian
    garlic at high concentrations, whereas in other studies, only quercetin was detected
    at 80.6 mg/kg DW in Polish garlic, or they were not detected.', 'Regarding the
    presence of phenolic acids in garlic, caffeic acid   and ferulic acid   were detected
    at the highest concentrations.', 'In relation to spinach, kaempferol  and quercetin   were
    the predominant flavonoids, although some quercetin glycosides were also detected.',
  'Moreover, several phenolic acids were determined in spinach, such as chlorogenic
    acid, caffeic acid and ferulic acid, among others.', 'It can be observed that
    several families of phenolic compounds could be determined in these types of vegetables,
    and therefore, suitable analytical methods that allow the simultaneous determination
    of these compounds should be developed.', 'In this sense, different methods were
    applied for the extraction of phenolic compounds from the matrices cited above.',
  'Ultrasound-assisted extraction was used for the extraction of phenolic compounds
    from artichoke, garlic  and spinach, using methanol/water as an extraction solvent
    but in different proportions, 80:20 v/v  and 70:30 v/v.', 'For the extraction
    of phenolic compounds from spinach, pressurized liquid extraction  was also used,
    utilizing a mixture of methanol/water, 70:30 v/v.', 'Phenolic compounds were also
    extracted from garlic  and artichoke  using maceration, utilizing as extraction
    solvent an aqueous solution of methanol  or a mixture of acetone/ethanol/methanol  respectively.',
  'In both cases, after maceration, the extract was evaporated to dryness under vacuum.',
  'For the extraction of phenolic compounds in garlic, quick, easy, cheap, effective,
    rugged and safe  procedure, using a clean-up step with primary secondary amine,
    C18 and magnesium sulphate, was also applied.', 'In some cases, an acid treatment
    was used to hydrolyze the glycosides, and the content of free and conjugated flavonoids
    such as aglycones is determined.', 'For instance, this procedure was applied in
    spinach and garlic, using 1.2 M hydrochloric acid  in methanol/water, or a mixture
    of ethanol/water/HCl  and butylated hydroxytoluene.', Several analytical methods
    have been reported for the separation and determination of phenolic compounds
    in vegetables., 'The most commonly used technique is high-performance liquid chromatography  coupled
    to ultraviolet, photodiode array detection, mass spectrometry, or tandem MS. MS/MS
    has become one of the main techniques for determination and quantification purposes,
    since this offers unambiguous identification and quantification of phenolic compounds
    and adequate sensitivity.', 'Recently, ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography  has
    emerged as a good alternative to HPLC insomuch as UHPLC offers other advantages
    such as shorter running time, better resolution and higher sensitivity.', 'Besides,
    UHPLC can be coupled to MS/MS allowing a rapid and effective detection of a wide
    range of compounds such as antibiotics, pesticides, mycotoxins, phenolic compounds
    or biogenic amines among others in different food matrices.', 'Although there
    are several studies determining phenolic compounds in different matrices, there
    are few studies that fully validated the proposed methodologies.', 'Therefore,
    the aim of the present work has been the determination of the phenolic composition
    in different types of vegetables, such as artichoke, garlic and spinach, applying
    a single method based on solid-liquid extraction  and UHPLC-MS/MS.', 'For that
    purpose, a method previously performed has been fully validated in these matrices,
    checking its suitability as well as its application to several samples of each
    type of matrix, contributing to increase the knowledge about the presence of phenolic
    compounds in these types of vegetables.', 'Commercial phenolic compound standards
    such as apigenin-7-O-glucoside, apigenin-6-C-glucoside, apigenin-8-C-glucoside,
    apigenin-7-O-rutinoside, apigenin-7-O-neohesperoside, daidzein, isorhamnetin,
    isorhamnetin-3-O-glucoside, isorhamnetin-3-O-rutinoside, kaempferol, kaempferol-3-O-glucoside,
    kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside, glycitein, luteolin, luteolin-6-C-glucoside, luteolin-8-C-glucoside,
    luteolin-4-O-glucoside, luteolin-7-O-glucoside, quercetin-3-O-galactoside, quercetin-3-O-rhamnoside,
    quercetin-3-O-rutinoside and tamarixetin were purchased from Extrasynthese.',
  'Other standards such as apigenin, baicalein, caffeic acid, ferulic acid, gallic
    acid, genistein, quercetin and quercetin 3-O-glucoside were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.',
  Stock standard solutions of individual compounds  were prepared by precise weighing
    of the powdered compounds in a calibration flask of 10 mL., 'Then, HPLC grade
    methanol or a mixture of methanol/water  was added to dissolve the standards.',
  'Then, the mixture was stored at 20 C in dark bottles.', A multicompound working
    standard solution at a concentration of 5 mg/L of each compound was prepared by
    appropriate dilution of the stock solutions with methanol and stored in screw-capped
    glass tubes at 20 C. The solutions were prepared every 6 months., Formic acid  was
    provided by Sigma-Aldrich., Ultrapure water was obtained from a Milli-Q Gradient
    water system., Ammonium acetate and anhydrous magnesium sulphate were purchased
    from Panreac., 'Chromatographic analysis was carried out using an Agilent series
    1290 RRLC instrument equipped with a binary pump, a high-performance autosampler,
    an autosampler thermostat  and a column compartment thermostat.', 'The system
    was coupled to an Agilent triple quadrupole mass spectrometer  with a Jet Stream
    ESI ion source, using positive and negative acquisition modes.', 'For the chromatographic
    separation of the extracts, a Zorbax Eclipse Plus C18 column  from Agilent was
    used.', The chromatographic conditions were optimized previously., 'Briefly, chromatographic
    separation was carried out using a gradient elution with methanol as eluent A
    and an aqueous solution of ammonium acetate, adjusted to pH 5 with formic acid
    as eluent B.', The analysis started with 5 % of eluent A., 'This composition was
    kept constant during 1.5 min, and then, it was linearly increased up to 30 % for
    2.5 min.', 'Next, it was increased to 100 % for 4 min.', 'This composition was
    held for further 2 min before being returned to the initial conditions of 30 s,
    followed by a re-equilibration time of 30 s, giving a total run time of 11 min.',
  'The flow rate was set at 0.2 mL/min, and column temperature was set at 30 C.


    An Agilent MassHunter Quantitative analysis  was used for data acquisition and
    quantification of samples.', 'A Reax-2 rotary agitator from Heidolph, an ultrasonic
    from Elma, lyophilizer Alpha from Martin Christ, vacuum pump from Vacuubrand  and
    analytical balance CPA-225-D from Sartorius  were also utilized.', 'Samples were
    homogenized, transferred to a petri dish, weighed and cooled to 18 C. All samples
    were processed according to a simple SLE, developed previously.', 'Briefly, 150
    mg of lyophilized sample was weighed in a 15-mL polypropylene centrifuge tube,
    and 3 mL of methanol/water  was added.', The mixture was agitated for 30 min using
    a rotary shaker., 'After that, the extract was filtered, and 300 L was transferred
    into a vial containing 200 L of mobile phase, and 5 L was injected into the UHPLC
    system.', Twelve samples of each matrix  were collected from supermarkets located
    in the province of Almera., Samples were chopped and homogenized at room temperature.,
  All samples were kept frozen at 18 C until lyophilization., A validation protocol
    of the optimized method was carried out in order to establish the suitable characteristics
    of the method., 'Several parameters such as matrix effect, linearity, limits of
    detection, limits of quantification  trueness, intra-day precision and inter-day
    precision were studied.', Matrix effect was studied to ensure bias-free analytical
    results., 'Because the samples were not standard reference materials and no blank
    samples were available, one sample of artichoke, garlic and spinach was spiked
    after extraction with the phenolic compounds at different concentrations, and
    the slopes of the calibration plots were compared with the results obtained when
    standard solutions of the phenolic compounds were analyzed.', 'The linearity of
    the method was also studied, using a sample extract to prepare the calibration
    curve.', 'In all the cases, determination coefficient was higher than 0.98.',
  LODs and LOQs were determined as the lowest concentration level that yielded a signal-to-noise  ratio
    of 3 and 10  respectively., 'Bearing in mind the presence of matrix effect and
    no blank matrices were available, LODs and LOQs were estimated by extrapolation
    of the S/N of the extract with known amount of analytes, and they were expressed
    as microgram per kilogram in matrix.', Trueness was estimated through recovery
    studies., 'Before extraction, different aliquots of each matrix   were spiked
    with the target compounds at two concentration levels, 2.5 and 5.0 mg/kg.', 'Then,
    they were extracted using the method previously commented.', 'Other aliquots of
    each matrix   were extracted without spiking, and recovery was calculated as follows:
    R = 100   / spiked concentration.', Precision of the overall method was estimated
    by performing both repeatability and reproducibility  studies., 'Repeatability
    was evaluated at 2.5 and 5.0 mg/kg of the recovery studies, performing five replicates
    at each level.', 'Inter-day precision was evaluated at 2.5 and 5 mg/kg in five
    different days, injecting three replicates each day.', 'A validation protocol
    of the optimized procedure was carried out in order to establish the performance
    characteristics of the method, ensuring the adequate identification, confirmation
    and quantification of the target compounds.', 'First matrix effect was studied,
    and slope ratios of matrix/solvent for each compound in the matrices evaluated
    are shown in Fig.', '1.', A tolerable signal suppression or enhancement effect
    was considered if the slope ratio ranged between 0.8 and 1.2., 'Values lower than
    0.8 or higher than 1.2 imply a signal suppression or enhancement, respectively.',
  'It can be observed that matrix significantly suppresses or enhances the response
    for all phenolic compounds depending on the type of matrix, except for apigenin.',
  'For this compound, no matrix effect was observed in any of the matrices tested.',
  'In spinach, signal suppression was mainly observed, although for some compounds
    such as luteolin-C-glucoside, chlorogenic acid, isorhamnetin and tamarixetin,
    signal enhancement was noted.', 'In this matrix, there were also some compounds
    that did not present matrix effect such as apigenin, luteolin-C-glucoside, genistein,
    kaempferol and quercetin.', 'On the other hand, no strong matrix effect was observed
    for most of the compounds in garlic, although for those compounds with significant
    matrix effect, signal enhancement was mainly observed, except for apigenin-C-glucoside,
    daidzein and glycitein, which had signal suppression.', 'When matrix effect was
    evaluated in artichoke, both signal suppression and enhancement were observed,
    although there were several compounds that did not present matrix effect.', 'For
    this matrix, it is important to highlight that the matrix effect for chlorogenic
    acid was almost 10, suggesting that matrix compounds significantly enhance the
    signal of this compound during the ionization process.', 'Therefore, in order
    to compensate this effect, standard addition calibration was used for quantification
    purposes, and one calibration curve was prepared per sample.', Slope ratios between
    matrix-matched and solvent calibrations., Compliance interval covering the range
    between 0.8 and 1.2 for tolerable matrix effect has been plotted., 'Code: 1 apigenin,
    2 apigenin-C-glucoside, 3 apigenin-O-derivate, 4 apigenin-7-O-glucoside, 5 baicalein,
    6 luteolin, 7 luteolin-C-glucoside, 8 luteolin-O-glucoside, 9 caffeic acid, 10
    chlorogenic acid, 11 ferulic acid, 12 gallic acid, 13 daidzein, 14 genistein,
    15 glycitein, 16 isorhamnetin, 17 isorhamnetin-3-O-glucoside, 18 isorhamnetin-3-O-rutinoside,
    19 kaempferol, 20 kaempferol-3-O-glucoside, 21 kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside, 22 quercetin,
    23 quercetin-O-derivate, 24 quercetin-3-O-rhamnoside, 25 quercetin-3-O-rutinoside,
    26 tamarixetin


    Table 1 shows the LODs and LOQs obtained for the three matrices studied.', 'It
    can be observed that LODs ranged from 5 to 25 g/kg, whereas LOQs ranged from 10
    to 50 g/kg for artichoke and garlic, whereas for spinach, LODs ranged from 1 to
    50 g/kg and LOQs ranged from 5 to 75 g/kg.', 'When these values were compared
    to those published in bibliography, it can be noted that they were lower than
    those provided by Mattila and Hellstrm  in artichoke and garlic or Silva et al.',
  'in garlic, where LOQs ranged from 20 to 540 g/kg.', 'However, the proposed values
    are higher than those obtained by Konar et al.', 'in artichoke, although the sensitivity
    is enough for the suitable determination of the target compounds.', "Limits of
    detection  and quantification  in artichoke, garlic and spinach  \n\nIn relation
    to trueness study, Table 2 shows the obtained results.", It can be observed that
    recoveries ranged from 61  to 108 %  for the selected compounds at 2.5 mg/kg and
    from 66  to 99 %  at 5 mg/kg for artichoke., 'In artichoke, gallic acid was not
    recovered.', This compound was identified by Snchez-Rabaneda et al., in artichoke
    waste but not in the raw material., 'For garlic, recoveries ranged from 60  to
    107 %  at 2.5 mg/kg and from 72  to 120 %  at 5 mg/kg.', 'Regarding spinach, the
    recoveries ranged from 60  to 118 %  at 2.5 mg/kg and from 61  to 118 %  at 5
    mg/kg.', It can be noted that repeatability values ) were always lower than 22
    % in all matrices., 'For inter-day precision, RSD values lower than 26 % were
    obtained in all the matrices.', 'Bearing in mind the different physico-chemical
    properties of the compounds included in this study and that they were extracted
    from several types of vegetables using the same procedure, trueness and precision
    can be considered suitable for reliable quantification of target compounds.',
  'Although some recoveries are not close to 100 %, they are acceptable since they
    are repetitive and reproducible.', "Validation parameters of the optimized UHPLC-MS/MS
    method in artichoke, garlic and spinach  \n\nOnce the analytical methodology was
    validated, it was applied to evaluate the concentration of phenolic compounds
    in artichoke, garlic and spinach.", 'The samples were analyzed in triplicate,
    showing the obtained results in Tables 3, 4 and 5, expressing the results as milligram
    per kilogram DW.', 'Furthermore, the total content as well as the content of different
    families of phenolic compounds in artichoke, garlic and spinach is shown in Fig.',
  '2, where it can be observed that artichoke  was the matrix with the highest content
    of phenolic compounds, followed by spinach  and garlic.', 'cMean and standard

    bars indicated standard deviation \n\nIn this matrix, flavone is an important
    family, detecting apigenin-7-O-glucoside at the highest concentration  followed
    by luteolin-O-glucoside, apigenin-O-derivate, luteolin  and apigenin, as it can
    be observed in Table 3.", 'In the literature, the concentrations of apigenin and
    luteolin glycosides ranged from not detected  to 700 and 6,500 mg/kg DW respectively,
    depending on the artichoke genotype analyzed.', 'Regarding the concentration of
    their aglycones found in previous studies, the concentration ranged from not detected
    to 1,500 mg/kg for apigenin and from 100 to 900 mg/kg DW  for luteolin.', 'On
    the other hand, phenolic acids also had an important role in the total content
    of phenolic compounds in artichoke.', 'Thus, chlorogenic acid was detected at
    concentrations ranging from 37.8 to 734.7 mg/kg DW.', 'The found concentration
    is similar to those detected in the other studies, where the concentration fluctuated
    from not detected to 2,100 mg/kg DW.', 'Other phenolic acids such as caffeic acid  and
    ferulic acid  were detected in artichoke, although at lower concentrations.',
  'In the literature, ferulic acid was not detected in Brazilian artichoke, although
    Anouar et al.', commented that ferulic acid is widely distributed in artichoke.,
  'Regarding the content of caffeic acid in artichoke, it ranges from 80 to 800 mg/kg
    DW.', 'In all the cases, the concentrations of this phenolic acid were higher
    in the previous studies than those in this one.', 'In relation to flavonols, isorhamnetin-3-O-glucoside  and
    isorhamnetin-3-O-rutinoside  were the flavonols detected at higher concentrations
    in the analyzed samples.', 'Up to our knowledge, this is the first study that
    detects the presence of these flavonols  in artichoke.', 'Finally, isoflavones
    were also found in artichoke, although only glycitein was detected.', 'However,
    previous studies did not evaluate the content of isoflavones in artichoke.', 'In
    general, a wide variability in the content of some phenolic compounds such as
    chlorogenic acid, luteolin-O-glucoside, apigenin and apigenin glycosides was noted
    among artichoke samples as it can be observed in Table 3.', 'This can be explained
    bearing in mind that several factors such as variety, crop type, environmental
    conditions and maturation could affect the final concentration of phenolic compounds.',
  Table 4 shows the obtained concentrations of phenolic compounds in garlic., The
    content of the studied phenolic compounds in garlic was lower than in artichoke.,
  Flavonols and phenolic acids were the families predominant in this matrix., Quercetin
    was the only flavonol detected in garlic., 'This result is in accordance to those
    obtained previously, where the concentration found in garlic ranged from not detected  to
    80 mg/kg.', 'Regarding phenolic acids, caffeic acid was the predominant phenolic
    acid, and its mean concentration was 7.2 mg/kg DW, ranging from 1.7 to 28.3 mg/kg
    DW, followed by ferulic acid, whose mean concentration was 3.5 mg/kg DW.', 'In
    previous studies, the concentration found for caffeic and ferulic acids in garlic
    ranged from 0.1 to 13.6 mg/kg  and from 0.3 to 15.2 mg/kg  respectively.', 'It
    can highlight the high variability observed for the content of caffeic acid in
    the samples analyzed, which can be explained considering the factors cited previously.',
  'In relation to flavones, apigenin was the only compound detected in the analyzed
    samples, and it was determined at low concentrations.', 'In previous studies,
    the concentration of this compound was 217 mg/kg DW  in garlic, although in other
    studies, this compound was not detected.', As it can be observed in Fig., '2,
    phenolic acid was the predominant family in spinach.', 'Ferulic acid was detected
    at the highest concentration, ranging from 18.0 to 41.4 mg/kg DW, followed by
    chlorogenic acid  and caffeic acid, as it can be indicated in Table 5.', 'In previous
    studies, chlorogenic acid and caffeic acid had been reported up to 13 mg/kg, whereas
    the concentration of ferulic acid ranged from not detected  to 296 mg/kg DW.',
  The content of flavones was also important., 'Thus, apigenin  and luteolin  were
    the compounds detected at higher concentrations.', It is important to indicate
    that these compounds were not detected previously in this matrix., 'In relation
    to flavonols, quercetin and isorhamnetin were detected.', The concentration of
    isorhamnetin  was higher than quercetin concentration  in spinach samples., 'In
    previous studies, the concentration of quercetin fluctuated from not detected  to
    766 mg/kg DW, whereas isorhamnetin was not detected previously.', 'Regarding isoflavones,
    glycitein was the only detected compound, and its concentration ranged from 2.2
    to 5.4 mg/kg DW.', 'Up to our knowledge, this is the first study that detects
    the presence of isoflavones in spinach.', 'This work presents a suitable method
    for the extraction, detection and quantification of phenolic compounds in artichoke,
    garlic and spinach by SLE and UHPLC-QqQ-MS/MS.', 'Extraction method, previously
    performed in other matrices, was checked for the suitable extraction of these
    compounds from the aforementioned matrices.', 'This methodology was validated
    in these matrices, obtaining suitable results.', The reliability of the method
    was performed by checking its suitability in different matrices., 'Moreover, the
    content of phenolic compounds in different matrices was compared, and the main
    results indicated that artichoke contains higher levels of phenolic compounds
    than garlic and spinach.', 'Flavone family was the predominant family in artichoke,
    while in garlic and spinach, flavonols and phenolic acids were the most significant
    respectively.', 'Finally, some compounds which were not previously detected in
    these samples were detected, although at low concentrations.', The authors are

  Liquid Chromatography Coupled to Tandem Mass Spectrometry
