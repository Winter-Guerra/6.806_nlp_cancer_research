text: [It has been suggested that combined effect of natural products may improve
    the treatment effectiveness in combating proliferation of cancer cells., 'Here,
    we examined the combined anticancer activities of compounds of three natural origin
    including baicalein, curcumin, and resveratrol with chemotherapy drug paclitaxel
    respectively, which showed that combination of paclitaxel with curcumin exhibited
    synergistic growth inhibition and induced significant apoptosis in MCF-7 cell
    lines.', Treatment of MCF-7 cell lines with paclitaxel and curcumin induced the
    apoptosis of regulatory protein Bcl-2 but decreased Bax expression., 'In addition,
    simultaneous treatment with paclitaxel and curcumin strongly inhibited paclitaxel-induced
    activities of EGFR signaling.', 'Furthermore, the combination of paclitaxel and
    curcumin exerted increased anti-tumor efficacy on mouse models.', 'Overall, our
    data described the promising therapeutic potential and underlying mechanisms of
    combining paclitaxel with curcumin in treating breast cancer.']
