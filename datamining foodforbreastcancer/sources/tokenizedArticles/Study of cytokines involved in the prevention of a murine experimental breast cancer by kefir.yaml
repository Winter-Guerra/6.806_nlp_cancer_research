text: [Previous studies have shown that compounds released during milk fermentation
    by Lactobacillus helveticus are implicated in the antitumour effect of this product.,
  'Here the effects of the consumption, during 2 or 7 days, of kefir or kefir cell-free
    fraction  on the systemic and local immune responses in mammary glands and tumours
    using a murine hormone-dependent breast cancer model were studied.', 'In the tumour
    control group, mice did not receive these products.', 'At the end of the feeding
    period, mice were injected subcutaneously with tumour cells in the mammary gland.',
  'Four days post-injection, they received kefir or KF on a cyclical basis.', 'Rate
    of tumour development, cytokines in serum; mammary gland tissue, and tumour isolated
    cells were monitored.', Two-day cyclical administration of both products delayed
    tumour growth., Both kefir and KF increased IL-10 in serum and decreased IL-6
    cells  in mammary glands., Two-day cyclical administration of KF increased IL-10
    cells in mammary glands and in tumours and decreased IL-6 cells in tumour., This
    study demonstrated the modulatory capacity of KF on the immune response in mammary
    glands and tumours and the importance of the administration period to obtain this
    effect.]
