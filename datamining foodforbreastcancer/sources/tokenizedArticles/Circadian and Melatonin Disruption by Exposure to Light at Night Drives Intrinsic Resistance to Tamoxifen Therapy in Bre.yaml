text: [Resistance to endocrine therapy is a major impediment to successful treatment
    of breast cancer., Preclinical and clinical evidence links resistance to antiestrogen
    drugs in breast cancer cells with the overexpression and/or activation of various
    pro-oncogenic tyrosine kinases., Disruption of circadian rhythms by night shift
    work or disturbed sleep-wake cycles may lead to an increased risk of breast cancer
    and other diseases., 'Moreover, light exposure at night  suppresses the nocturnal
    production of melatonin that inhibits breast cancer growth.', 'In this study,
    we used a rat model of estrogen receptor  MCF-7 tumor xenografts to demonstrate
    how altering light/dark cycles with dim LEN  speed the development of breast tumors,
    increasing their metabolism and growth and conferring an intrinsic resistance
    to tamoxifen therapy.', 'These characteristics were not observed in animals in
    which the circadian melatonin rhythm was not disrupted, or in animals subjected
    to dLEN if they received nocturnal melatonin replacement.', 'Strikingly, our results
    also showed that melatonin acted both as a tumor metabolic inhibitor and a circadian-regulated
    kinase inhibitor to reestablish the sensitivity of breast tumors to tamoxifen
    and tumor regression.', 'Together, our findings show how dLEN-mediated disturbances
    in nocturnal melatonin production can render tumors insensitive to tamoxifen.',
