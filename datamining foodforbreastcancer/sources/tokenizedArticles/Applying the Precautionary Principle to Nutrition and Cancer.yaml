    individuals making dietary decisions from day to day cannot wait for the evolution
    of scientific consensus.', 'To protect themselves and their families, they have
    to act on the best available evidence.', The concept of the precautionary principle
    is commonly understood in toxicology and environmental health., 'For example,
    the European Union invokes the precautionary principle when there are reasonable
    grounds for concern that potential hazards may affect the environment or human,
    animal or plant health, and when at the same time the available data preclude
    a detailed risk evaluation [2, p. 92\.', 'Commission of the European Communities:

  'This approach is not as familiar in nutritional sciences but may play a useful
    role in cases in cancer prevention, due to the limited practicality of randomized
