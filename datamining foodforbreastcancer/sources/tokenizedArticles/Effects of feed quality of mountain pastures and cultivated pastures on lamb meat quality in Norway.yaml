text: [Norwegian lamb meat production is mainly based on free grazing in mountainous
    pastures during the summer., 'Prior to slaughter in the autumn, some lambs not
    big enough for slaughter are finished on, e.g., cultivated pastures.', 'This study
    looked at the feed quality of different forages, and the effect on lamb meat quality.',
  'Lambs grazed on mountain pastures at Kvalya in Northern Norway  and Sr-Fron in
    Mid Norway  in 2007, and a subgroup at each location was finished on cultivated
    pastures for 6 weeks prior to slaughter in September.', 'The fibre content was
    significantly higher in the cultivated pasture in Mid Norway compared to the mountain
    pasture, while no differences between pastures in Northern Norway were found.',
  In Mid Norway the content of polyunsaturated fatty acid  was significantly higher
    in meat from lambs grazing the mountain pasture compared to lamb grazing the cultivated
    pasture., 'For Northern Norway, the opposite pattern was observed.', 'The higher
    18:3 content may be attributable to lower fibre content at the mountain pasture
    in Mid Norway.', 'In our study, there appears to be an effect of fibre content
    on the fatty acid composition in lamb meat.']
