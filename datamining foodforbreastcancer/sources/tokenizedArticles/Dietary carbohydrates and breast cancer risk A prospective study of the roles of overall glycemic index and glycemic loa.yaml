text: ['We examined breast cancer risk in association with overall glycemic index,
    glycemic load, and dietary carbohydrate and sugar intake in a prospective cohort
    of 49,613 Canadian women enrolled in the National Breast Screening Study who completed
    a self-administered food frequency questionnaire between 1980 and 1985.', 'Linkages
    to national mortality and cancer databases yielded data on deaths and cancer incidence,
    with follow-up ending between 1998 and 2000.', 'During a mean follow-up of 16.6
    years, we observed 1,461 incident breast cancer cases.', 'GI, GL, total carbohydrate
    and total sugar intake were not associated with breast cancer risk in the total
    cohort.', 'However, there was evidence of effect modification of the association
    between GI and breast cancer risk by menopausal status, the hazard ratio for the
    highest versus the lowest quintile level of GI being 0.78  in premenopausal women
    and 1.87  in postmenopausal women.', The associations between GI and GL were not
    modified by body mass index  or by vigorous physical activity among pre- or postmenopausal
    women., 'Similarly, the associations between GI/GL and risk in postmenopausal
    women were not modified by BMI, vigorous physical activity, or ever use of hormone
    replacement therapy, although the associations were slightly stronger among those
    who reported no vigorous physical activity, among those who reported ever using
    HRT  and among normal-weight women.', 'Our data suggest that consumption of diets
    with high GI values may be associated with increased risk of breast cancer among
    postmenopausal women, possibly more so among subgroups defined by participation
    in vigorous physical activity, ever use of HRT and those who are not overweight.',

    Glycemic index  is a means of classifying the carbohydrate content of individual
    foods according to their postprandial glycemic effects and hence their effects
    on blood insulin levels.1, 2, 3 Using glycemic index values and the carbohydrate
    content of foods, the total glycemic effect of the diet  can be estimated.4 Consumption
    of high GI diets has been associated with hyperinsulinemia,1, 4, 5 while low GI
    diets have been shown to be associated with a lower postprandial rise in insulin,6
    thus maintaining insulin sensitivity.7


    Hyperinsulinemia has been shown to be associated with increased breast cancer
    risk,8, 9 and it is conceivable that this reflects an underlying association with
    high glycemic index diets.', 'To date, there have been several studies of the
    association between dietary glycemic load and glycemic index and breast cancer
    risk.10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 The results of 3 of these investigations were null,11,
    12, 14 whereas the other 3 studies observed associations either overall15 or within
    subgroups defined by physical activity13 or obesity.10 Given the mixed results
    of previous studies, we examined the relationship between overall glycemic index
    and glycemic load, as well as total carbohydrate and total sugar consumption,
    and breast cancer risk in a prospective cohort study of Canadian women.', 'We
    examined risk overall and across strata defined by menopausal status, body mass
    index, physical activity and hormone replacement therapy  use.', 'The study, which
    has been described in detail elsewhere,17 was conducted among participants in
    the Canadian National Breast Screening Study, a randomized controlled trial of
    screening for breast cancer.18 A total of 89,835 women aged 40-59 years were recruited
    into the trial between 1980 and 1985.', 'At recruitment into the study, participants
    completed a self-administered questionnaire that sought information on demographic
    characteristics, lifestyle factors, menstrual and reproductive history, as well
    as use of oral contraceptives and replacement estrogens.', 'Starting in 1982,
    a self-administered food frequency questionnaire  was distributed to all new attendees
    at all screening centers and to women returning to the screening centers for rescreening.19
    The FFQ sought information on usual portion size and frequency of consumption
    of 86 food items and included photographs of various portion sizes to assist respondents
    with quantifying intake.', 'A comparison between the self-administered questionnaire
    and a full interviewer-administered questionnaire, which has been subjected to
    both validity and reliability testing19 and used in a number of epidemiologic
    studies,20 revealed that the 2 methods gave estimates of intake of the major macronutrients
    and dietary fiber that were moderately to strongly correlated with each other.19
    A total of 49,613 dietary questionnaires were returned and available for analysis.',
  Data from the completed self-administered food frequency questionnaires were used
    to estimate daily intake of nutrients using a database for Canadian foods that
    has been described elsewhere.20 Data from the food frequency questionnaire were
    also used to estimate overall glycemic index and glycemic load., 'Glycemic index
    values of foods were obtained from published reports based on studies in North
    America.4 Overall glycemic index was calculated by multiplying the carbohydrate
    content  of a given food item by the number of servings per day of that food item
    and its glycemic index value, summing all food items reported and dividing by
    the total carbohydrate in the diet.', Total dietary glycemic load was calculated
    by multiplying the carbohydrate content of a given food item by the number of
    servings consumed per day and its glycemic index value and summing the values
    for all food items reported., 'Each unit increase in glycemic load represents
    the insulin response to the equivalent of 1 g glucose or carbohydrate from white
    bread.21 When the reported glycemic index values for foods were observed to vary
    across studies,4 we used the mean of the reported values of glycemic index for
    that food.', The main foods contributing to glycemic load in the cohort are listed
    in a footnote to Table I., 'Cases were women who were diagnosed during follow-up
    with incident breast cancer, ascertained by means of computerized record linkage
    to the Canadian Cancer Database.', Deaths were ascertained by means of record
    linkage to the National Mortality Database., Both of these databases are maintained
    by Statistics Canada., 'The linkages to the databases yielded data on cancer incidence
    and mortality to 31 December 2000 for women in Ontario, 31 December 1998 for women
    in Quebec and 31 December 1999 for women in other provinces in Canada.', 'Among
    the women for whom dietary data were available, we identified 1,461 incident breast
    cancers.', 'Of the 49,613 women with dietary data, we excluded women with extreme
    energy intake values.', 'These exclusions left 49,111 women available for analysis,
    among whom there were 1,450 incident cases of breast cancer.', 'Cox proportional
    hazards models  were used to estimate hazard ratios  and 95% confidence intervals  for
    the association between energy-adjusted quintile levels of glycemic load, overall
    glycemic index, total carbohydrates and total sugar, as well as breast cancer
    risk; energy adjustment was performed using the residual method.22 For these analyses,
    cases contributed person-time to the study from their date of enrollment until
    the date of diagnosis of their breast cancer, and noncases contributed person-time
    from their date of enrollment until the termination of follow-up  or death, whichever
    occurred earlier.', Multivariate models included the variables listed in the footnote
    of Table II., 'To test for trend, we fitted the median value of each quintile
    as an ordinal variable in the risk models and evaluated the statistical significance
    of the coefficient using the Wald test.23 We examined the associations overall
    and within strata defined by menopausal status.', Women who reported having regular
    menstrual periods within the past 12 months or who had had a hysterectomy without
    bilateral oophorectomy and were less than 45 years of age were classified as premenopausal.,
  'Women whose menstrual periods ceased prior to 12 months before baseline, those
    who had had a bilateral oophorectomy and those who had had a hysterectomy and
    were over 55 years of age were considered postmenopausal.24 In addition, the associations
    overall and within menopausal strata were examined further within subgroups defined
    by body mass index, self-reported vigorous physical activity  and use of hormone
    replacement therapy.', 'Given the relatively small number of cases within each
    stratum of pre- and postmenopausal women, we categorized overall glycemic index
    and glycemic load by quartiles for the latter analyses.', Stratum-specific multivariate
    models included the variables listed in a footnote in Table III., 'Interaction
    effects were tested independently of each other such that in the analysis of interaction
    with BMI, physical activity and HRT use were controlled for; in the analysis of
    interaction with physical activity, BMI and HRT use were controlled for; and in
    the analysis of interaction with HRT use, BMI and physical activity were controlled
    for.', Tests for interaction were based on likelihood ratio tests comparing models
    with and without product terms representing the variables of interest., Use of
    the life test procedure in SAS showed that the proportional hazards assumption
    was met in this data set., All analyses were performed using SAS version 9., 'The
    average duration of follow-up for cohort members was 16.6 years, corresponding
    to a total of 811,649 person-years of follow-up for the cohort.', The mean age
    at diagnosis for the cases was 54.8  6.5 years., 'For the cohort as a whole, the
    mean  SD of the energy-adjusted overall glycemic index and glycemic load were
    74.6  12.2 and 144.5  42.5 g/day, respectively.', There was a 2-fold variation
    in mean glycemic load values between the lowest and highest quintile levels.,
  'Compared to those with relatively low glycemic load values, women with high glycemic
    load values reported lower alcohol consumption, were less likely to have ever
    smoked, had a shorter mean duration of oral contraceptive use, had a longer mean
    duration of hormone replacement therapy, had slightly lower mean body mass index,
    were more likely to be postmenopausal at baseline, were less likely to have a
    relatively early age at menarche and consumed more total carbohydrates, sugar
    and fiber.', 'No appreciable variation was observed in mean energy intake, participation
    in vigorous physical activity, parity, or age at first birth by quintile levels
    of glycemic load.', The patterns for overall glycemic index were similar to those
    for the glycemic load., 'Table II shows that in age- and energy-adjusted models,
    there was no association between glycemic load, overall glycemic index, total
    carbohydrate, or total sugar intake and risk of breast cancer.', 'After multivariate
    adjustment, the hazard ratios remained essentially unchanged.', Risk of breast
    cancer associated with glycemic load differed little between premenopausal and
    postmenopausal women., 'However, there was some suggestion of effect modification
    of the association between overall glycemic index and breast cancer risk by menopausal
    status.', 'Among premenopausal women, the highest versus the lowest quartile level
    of overall glycemic index was associated with a 22% reduction in risk, while among
    postmenopausal women, the highest versus lowest quartile level of overall glycemic
    index was associated with an 87% increased risk of breast cancer.', 'On formal
    testing, the interaction between overall glycemic index and menopausal status
    was statistically significant.', There was no association between total sugar
    intake and breast cancer risk among pre- or postmenopausal women., 'Likewise,
    total carbohydrate consumption was not associated with risk among either pre-
    or postmenopausal women.', 'On formal testing, menopausal status did not modify
    the association between either total sugar intake  or total carbohydrate consumption  and
    breast cancer risk.', 'Within the total study population, there was no evidence
    of effect modification of the association between glycemic load and overall glycemic
    index and breast cancer risk by BMI or vigorous physical activity.', 'Likewise,
    Table IV shows that the associations between glycemic load and overall glycemic
    index and breast cancer risk among premenopausal women were not modified by BMI
    or vigorous physical activity.', 'In addition, BMI and participation in vigorous
    physical activity did not modify the association between either total sugar intake
    or total carbohydrate intake and breast cancer risk.', 'Table V shows the associations
    between glycemic load and overall glycemic index and breast cancer risk among
    postmenopausal women, stratified by BMI, participation in vigorous physical activity
    and HRT use.', 'As with premenopausal women, the association between glycemic
    load and breast cancer risk among postmenopausal women did not appear to be modified
    by any of these variables.', 'With respect to overall glycemic index, the highest
    versus lowest quartile level was associated with increased risk among both overweight/obese  and
    normal weight postmenopausal women.', 'As well, among women who participated in
    vigorous physical activity, the highest versus lowest quartile level of overall
    glycemic index was associated with a 78% increase in risk, while a hazard ratio
    of 1.86  was observed for the highest versus the lowest quartile level among postmenopausal
    women who did not participate in any vigorous physical activity.', 'Furthermore,
    among ever users of HRT, the highest versus lowest quartile level of overall glycemic
    index was associated with a 2.2-fold increased risk of breast cancer, whereas
    among never users, there was a 58%  increased risk of breast cancer at the uppermost
    quartile level.', 'There was no statistical evidence for interactions between
    overall glycemic index and BMI, participation in vigorous physical activity, or
    HRT use  in relation to breast cancer risk among postmenopausal women.', 'Similarly,
    the associations between total sugar intake and total carbohydrate intake and
    risk of breast cancer did not appear to be modified by BMI, participation in vigorous
    physical activity, or HRT use among postmenopausal women.', 'High glycemic index
    diets are associated with increased insulin secretion,1, 4, 5, 26 which may affect
    breast cancer risk by several mechanisms, including alteration of cell cycle kinetics,27
    inhibition of apoptosis28 and elevation of plasma estrogen levels via lower production
    of sex hormone-binding globulin.29


    In the prospective study reported here, there was no association between either
    overall glycemic index or glycemic load and breast cancer risk over a 16-year
    follow-up period in the total study population.', 'Likewise, no association was
    found between either total sugar or total carbohydrate intake and risk of breast
    cancer.', 'There was some suggestion of increased risk in association with overall
    glycemic index among women who were postmenopausal at baseline, while statistically
    nonsignificant reductions in risk were observed at each level of overall glycemic
    index  among premenopausal women.', 'The differences between pre- and postmenopausal
    women were characterized further upon stratification by body mass index  and participation
    in vigorous physical activity, wherein small, statistically nonsignificant decreases
    in risk were observed in association with glycemic load and overall glycemic index
    within strata of BMI and participation in vigorous physical activity among premenopausal
    women, and positive associations were found within strata of BMI and vigorous
    physical activity in postmenopausal women.', 'In postmenopausal women, there were
    also increases in risk within strata defined by HRT use.', 'There was some suggestion
    that the associations were slightly stronger among women who had ever used HRT
    and those who never participated in vigorous physical activity, but there was
    no statistical evidence of effect modification by these variables.', 'In our study
    population, glycemic load was not associated with risk, whereas overall glycemic
    index was associated with breast cancer risk within specific subgroups.', 'In
    trying to understand these differences, it is important to note that these indexes
    reflect slightly different characteristics of dietary carbohydrate intake.', 'Overall
    glycemic index provides information on overall carbohydrate quality in the diet
    by comparing the effect of isoenergetic intakes of carbohydrate, while total dietary
    glycemic load, by taking into account the amount of carbohydrate consumed, provides
    information on both the quality and quantity of total dietary carbohydrate intake.4
    Thus, while the study participants who developed breast cancer may have consumed
    a wider variety of high glycemic index foods  in comparison to women who did not
    develop breast cancer during follow-up, they may not have consumed these foods
    in large enough quantities for glycemic load to have an effect on breast cancer
    risk.', 'Given that high body mass index and lack of physical activity are generally
    associated with increased fasting insulin26 and decreased insulin sensitivity,30,
    31, 32 women who are obese or who do not participate in physical activity may
    have a more pronounced insulin response to foods with higher glycemic values.',
  'Further, high glycemic value diets are associated with higher free estrogen levels
    due to the effect of insulin in lowering sex hormone-binding globulin  production31,
    33 and enhancing aromatization of androgens.30, 34 Hence, it is possible that
    postmenopausal women who use hormone replacement therapy and whose diets are characterized
    by consumption of high glycemic index foods may be at increased risk of hormone-mediated
    neoplasms, such as breast cancer, due to greater exposure to free estrogen through
    a combination of pathways.', Previous studies of overall GI and GL have yielded
    mixed results., 'For example, Augustin et al.,15 in a hospital-based case-control
    study of Italian women, reported statistically significant increased risks associated
    with the highest versus lowest quintile level of both overall GI  and GL.', 'In
    addition, the relationship between glycemic load/index and breast cancer has been
    examined in 5 prospective studies.10, 11, 12, 13, 14 In keeping with our findings,
    Holmes et al.,14 in an analysis of data from the Nurses Health Study, which included
    4,092 incident cases of breast cancer, observed no association between glycemic
    load or overall glycemic index and risk of breast cancer overall, but reported
    a borderline positive association between overall glycemic index and breast cancer
    risk among postmenopausal women.', 'In contrast, Jonas et al.12 and Folsom et
    al.,11 in analyses of data from the CPS II Nutrition Cohort  and Iowa Womens Health
    Study, respectively, reported no association between glycemic load/index and breast
    cancer risk among postmenopausal women.', 'In the present study, there was some
    suggestion of an inverse association between overall glycemic index and risk among
    premenopausal women.', 'In contrast, Cho et al.,10 in an analysis of 714 incident
    breast cancer cases from the Nurses Health Study II, did not find any association
    between glycemic load/index among premenopausal women, and Higgenbotham et al.13  reported
    a positive association between glycemic load and risk among premenopausal women,
    but observed no association in the total study population of pre- and postmenopausal
    women.', Three of the previous studies also examined dietary carbohydrate and/or
    dietary sugar intake in relation to breast cancer risk., 'Holmes et al.14 found
    no association between either dietary carbohydrates or dietary fiber and breast
    cancer risk, whereas Cho et al.10 reported an inverse association with carbohydrate
    intake among premenopausal women with a BMI ; 25 kg/m2.', 'Augustin et al.15 reported
    a positive trend with white bread consumption among postmenopausal women, but
    not among premenopausal women, as well as evidence of a positive association with
    sugar intake among both pre- and postmenopausal women.', 'In a recent case-control
    study, Romieu et al.35 also reported a statistically significant increased risk
    of breast cancer for the highest versus the lowest quartile level of carbohydrate
    consumption.', 'Each of these studies differed with respect to age at baseline,
    mean age at diagnosis and/or the range of glycemic load/index values, both from
    each other and from our study, making it difficult to draw firm conclusions regarding
    the role of glycemic load in breast cancer etiology.', Our data are limited by
    the possibility of error with respect to the measurement of diet and the calculation
    of glycemic load., 'Error in the measurement of daily intake of carbohydrates
    and sugars may have resulted from inaccurate recall.36 Furthermore, measurement
    error might have occurred due to the fact that the glycemic index values of some
    foods are currently based on only 1 or 2 often small studies.4 However, this applies
    to the previous studies of glycemic index/load and breast cancer as well.', Additional
    limitations include the fact that information on menopausal status was collected
    only at baseline., 'Given that the minimum age at baseline was 40 and an average
    of 16 years of follow-up, it is likely that most of those who were premenopausal
    at enrollment would have become postmenopausal during the course of follow-up.',
  'Thus, it is likely that our results for premenopausal women are largely accounted
    for by a mix of breast cancers diagnosed pre- and postmenopausally.', 'In addition,
    the results stratified by physical activity should be interpreted with caution
    given that approximately 22% of the study subjects were missing information on
    physical activity.', 'Also, although we adjusted our estimates for a wide range
    of potentially confounding variables, uncontrolled confounding by dietary and
    other factors cannot be excluded.', 'In conclusion, the results of our study suggest
    that dietary glycemic load is not associated with risk of breast cancer.', 'In
    contrast, while overall glycemic index was not associated with risk of breast
    cancer in the total study population, a relatively high overall glycemic index
    might be associated with increased risk among women who are postmenopausal, perhaps
    more so among those who do not participate in vigorous physical activity or who
    have ever used HRT.', 'However, these observations require confirmation in other
    studies.', 'The authors thank Statistics Canada, the provincial and territorial
    Registrars of Vital Statistics and the Cancer Registry directors for their assistance
    in making the cancer incidence and mortality data available.']
