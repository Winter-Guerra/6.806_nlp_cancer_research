text: [Dietary antioxidants are often defined by in vitro measures of antioxidant
    activity., 'Such measures are valid indicators of the antioxidant potential, but
    provide little evidence of activity as a dietary antioxidant.', 'This study was
    undertaken to assess the in vivo antioxidant efficacy of a berry fruit extract
    by measuring biomarkers of oxidative damage to protein, lipids, and DNA  and plasma
    antioxidant status  in rats when fed basal diets containing fish and soybean oils,
    which are likely to generate different levels of oxidative stress.', Boysenberry  extract
    was used as the dietary antioxidant., 'The basal diets  had significant effects
    on the biomarkers of oxidative damage and antioxidant status, with rats fed the
    synthetic/fish oil diet having the lowest levels of oxidative damage and the highest
    antioxidant status.', 'When boysenberry extract was added to the diet, there was
    little change in 8-oxo-2-deoxyguanosine excretion in urine, oxidative damage to
    proteins decreased, and plasma malondialdehyde either increased or decreased depending
    on the basal diet.', 'This study showed that boysenberry extract functioned as
    an in vivo antioxidant and raised the antioxidant status of plasma while decreasing
    some biomarkers of oxidative damage, but the effect was highly modified by basal
    diet.', 'Our results are further evidence of complex interactions among dietary
    antioxidants, background nutritional status as determined by diet, and the biochemical
    nature of the compartments in which antioxidants function.']
