text: ['The reduction of subclinical inflammation has been suggested as a potential
    mechanism to explain the favorable association between whole-grain consumption
    and reduced risk for cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and certain cancers.',
  This review examines evidence for the effects of whole-grain consumption on markers
    of subclinical inflammation derived from 13 epidemiological and 5 interventional
    studies retrieved from a search of the PubMed database., Epidemiological studies
    provide reasonable support for an association between diets high in whole grains
    and lower C-reactive protein  concentrations., 'After adjusting for other dietary
    factors, each serving of whole grains is estimated to reduce CRP concentrations
    by approximately 7%.', 'In contrast to epidemiological studies, interventional
    studies do not demonstrate a clear effect of increased whole-grain consumption
    on CRP or other markers of inflammation.', 'Issues related to insufficient length
    of intervention, extent of dietary control, population selection, types of whole
    grains, and lack of a direct anti-inflammatory effect may underlie these discrepant
    findings.', Additional carefully controlled interventional studies are needed
    to clarify the effects of whole grains on subclinical inflammation.]
