text: ['The aim of this study was to determine the nutritional quality and protein
    value of the baru almond, pequi almond, and cerrado cashew nut compared to the
    peanut.', 'We determined the proximate chemical composition, mineral content,
    and amino acid profile.', 'A biological assay was carried out to assess the protein
    value, by net protein ratio, relative net protein ratio, and protein digestibility-corrected
    amino acid score  indexes.', 'We found that the exotic almonds and the nut are
    rich in proteins, lipids, fibres, iron and zinc.', Baru almonds protein did not
    show deficiency in essential amino acids and lysine was the first limiting amino
    acid in the proteins of the pequi almond and cerrado cashew nut., 'The baru almond
    showed a RNPR of 86%, similar to that of the cerrado cashew nut, but higher than
    that of the peanut  and of the pequi almond.', 'The PDCAAS value of the baru almond  was
    the highest and cerrado cashew nut and peanut presented similar values of this
    index, which were higher than that of the pequi almond.', 'The baru almond has
    the highest protein quality, but the cerrado cashew nut and peanut are sources
    of good quality protein, too.', 'We recommend the inclusion of these exotic foods
    in healthy diets and in food industry, and the baru almond and cerrado cashew
    nut as sources of complementary protein.']
