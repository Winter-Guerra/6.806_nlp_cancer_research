text: ['Heterocyclic amines, potent mutagens and a risk factor for human cancers,
    are produced in meats cooked at high temperature.', The aim of this study was
    to determine the HCA content in cooked meat products  prepared by various cooking
    methods  that are preferred by U.S. meat consumers., 'The primary HCAs in these
    samples were PhIP, MeIQx, and DiMeIQx.', Type and content of HCAs in cooked meat
    samples were highly dependent on cooking conditions., The total HCA content in
    well-done meat was 3.5 times higher than that of medium-rare meat., Fried pork  had
    higher levels of total HCAs than fried beef  and fried chicken., 'Among the samples,
    fried bacon contained the highest total HCA content.']
