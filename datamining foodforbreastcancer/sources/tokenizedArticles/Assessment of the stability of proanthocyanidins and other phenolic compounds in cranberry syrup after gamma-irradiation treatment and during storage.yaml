text: [Shelf life of commercial cranberry syrup irradiated with gamma radiation at
    a rate of 5 kGy and stored for 6 months at 25 C and 60% relative humidity  and
    under accelerated stability conditions was investigated., High-performance liquid
    chromatography coupled to electrospray ionisation quadrupole-time-of-flight mass
    spectrometry  was used to characterise cranberry syrup., 'Afterwards, these compounds
    were quantified by HPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS and 4-dimethylaminocinnamaldehyde  assay.',
  A significant increase in the content of procyanidin B isomer 1  and procyanidin
    A2  was observed after irradiation and compared with the non-irradiated syrup.,
  'Procyanidin B isomers and prodelphinidin were stable at 25 C during the first month
    of storage, whereas quercetin and some derivatives remained constant for 3 months
    of storage at this temperature.', 'In short, after gamma-irradiation in dose of
    5 kGy, most compounds were highly stable for a month at 25 C.']
