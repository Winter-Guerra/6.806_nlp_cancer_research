text: ['The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of germination on the
    phenolic acids and flavonoids profile, as well as antioxidant activity, in selected
    edible seeds of mung beans, radish, broccoli and sunflower.', 'Germination increased
    the total phenolic  and flavonoid  levels, as well as the AA of the seeds, and
    influenced the profile of free and bound phenolic compounds.', 'Among the samples,
    mung bean was characterised by lowest levels of TP and TF, as well as AA, evaluated
    using ABTS, DPPH and FRAP assays.', Sunflower and radish sprouts were the most
    rich in phenolic compounds., Insignificant amounts of free phenolic acids were
    found in the free phenolic acid fraction; alkaline hydrolysis of the seeds and
    sprouts extracts provided the majority of the phenolic acids., The amounts of
    free and bound flavonoids were inconsiderable both for seeds and sprouts.]
