text: [Consumption of cruciferous vegetables is associated with reduced risk of various
    types of cancer., Isothiocyanates including sulforaphane and erucin are believed
    to be responsible for this activity., 'Erucin, which is metabolically and structurally
    related to sulforaphane, is present in large quantities in arugula, kohlrabi and
    Chinese cabbage.', 'However, its cancer preventive mechanisms remain poorly understood.',
  'We found that erucin inhibits proliferation of MCF7 breast cancer cells  in parallel
    with cell cycle arrest at mitosis  and apoptosis, by a mechanism consistent with
    impairment of microtubule dynamics.', Concentrations of 515 M erucin suppressed
    the dynamic instability of microtubules during interphase in the cells., 'Most
    dynamic instability parameters were inhibited, including the rates and extents
    of growing and shortening, the switching frequencies between growing and shortening,
    and the overall dynamicity.', Much higher erucin concentrations were required
    to reduce the microtubule polymer mass., 'In addition, erucin suppressed dynamic
    instability of microtubules reassembled from purified tubulin in similar fashion.',
  'The effects of erucin on microtubule dynamics, like those of sulforaphane, are
    similar qualitatively to those of much more powerful clinically-used microtubule-targeting
    anticancer drugs, including taxanes and the vinca alkaloids.', 'The results suggest
    that suppression of microtubule dynamics by erucin and the resulting impairment
    of critically important microtubule-dependent cell functions such as mitosis,
    cell migration and microtubule-based transport may be important in its cancer
    preventive activities.', 'Citation: Azarenko O, Jordan MA, Wilson L  Erucin, the

    demonstrated that dietary vegetables such as cabbage, cauliflower, kale, arugula,
    wild rocket and broccoli contain cancer preventive and anti-cancer activities.',
  'Isothiocyanates such as sulforaphane and erucin may be responsible for these actions,.',
  'Several mechanisms are thought to play a role in the cancer preventive activities
    of isothiocyanates, including inhibition of Phase I carcinogen-activating enzymes,,
    induction of Phase II carcinogen detoxification enzymes,, inhibition of cancer
    cell proliferation by cell cycle arrest at G2/M, and removal of premalignant and
    malignant cells through the induction of apoptosis .', Sulforaphane is the most
    extensively studied isothiocyanate found in cruciferous vegetables., It is especially
    prominent in broccoli and broccoli sprouts., 'However, much less is known about
    the anticancer activity of erucin, a structurally-related sulfide analog of sulforaphane..
    Cruciferous salad crops such as arugula and wild rocket  and Diplotaxis tenuifolia
    species), several varieties of Chinese cabbage, and kohlrabi, all commonly ingested,
    accumulate large quantities of glucoerucin , and erucin is produced from this
    precursor by the endogenous enzyme myrosinase when the vegetables are chopped
    or chewed.', 'Erucin is also an in vivo metabolite of sulforaphane formed through
    reduction of sulforaphanes thiomethyl group when various cabbages, especially
    broccoli and broccoli sprouts, are consumed.', 'Also, the inter-conversion of
    sulforaphane and erucin is a favored metabolic reaction in animal models and in
    human subjects who consume either fresh broccoli sprouts or a broccoli supplement
    .', Dietary isothiocyanates are well absorbed and attain good bioavailability
    ., Figure 1., 'Effects of erucin on MCF7 cell proliferation, mitotic index, cell
    cycle progression and apoptosis.', Erucin  inhibits proliferation along with mitotic
    arrest., Cells were incubated with a range of erucin concentrations for 72 hours
    and SRB cell proliferation assays were performed to assess cell proliferation.,
  'To determine the mitotic index, cells were incubated with erucin for 24 hours,
    fixed, and stained with DAPI to visualize DNA.', 'Data are the mean of three to
    four independent experiments; bars,  SEM.', Erucin arrests cells at G2/M., Non-synchronized
    cells were treated with a range of erucin concentrations for 24 hours and analyzed
    by flow cytometry., 'White bars represent G1 phase, gray bars, S phase, and black
    bars, G2/M phase of the cell cycle.', 'Erucin induces time-, and concentration-dependent
    apoptosis.', Cells were incubated with a range of erucin concentrations for 24
    hours  and 48 hours  and the total number of apoptotic cells  for each condition
    was determined by flow cytometry., Results are the mean  SEM of at least three
    independent experiments performed in duplicate., 'Like sulforaphane, erucin induces
    Phase II detoxification enzymes,  and inhibits Phase I enzymes.', It also has
    antioxidant activity  and increases expression of multidrug resistance transporters
    in human carcinoma cell lines., 'In addition, erucin arrests cell cycle progression
    and induces apoptosis in human lung carcinoma, hepatoma and leukemia cell lines
    .', These actions may all play a role in erucins anticancer actions., The structural
    similarity between erucin and sulforaphane and the prominence of erucin in several
    widely-consumed cruciferous vegetables led us to explore the anti-proliferative
    effects of erucin and its effects on the polymerization and dynamics of microtubules
    in breast cancer cells and on the dynamics of microtubules reassembled from purified
    tubulin., 'Microtubules are dynamic tube shaped protein polymers  that play important
    roles in determining cell shape, polarity, cellular migration, signaling, and
    mitosis .', 'Microtubules can undergo two unusual non-equilibrium dynamic behaviors,
    dynamic instability, the switching between growth and shortening at microtubule
    plus ends,, and treadmilling, the net plus end assembly and minus end disassembly.',
  'Microtubule dynamics are rapid during mitosis and are critical for the accurate
    and time-sensitive attachment of chromosomes to the mitotic spindle, movement
    of the chromosomes to form the metaphase plate, and production of proper tension
    at the kinetochores, all of which are essential for the passage through the metaphase/anaphase
    spindle checkpoint,.', 'Microtubule dynamics are also important in cell polarity,
    cell migration and metastasis.', 'Many commonly used anticancer drugs act by modulating
    microtubule dynamics including the taxanes, the vinca alkaloids, maytansinoids,
    and eribulin,.', 'At a mechanistic level, microtubule-targeting agents act in
    two ways in cells and in vitro.', 'At relatively high concentrations, they either
    reduce or augment the mass of assembled microtubules.', 'At their lowest effective
    concentrations, they modulate the growing and shortening dynamics of microtubules
    without affecting the microtubule polymer mass.', 'Most microtubule-targeting
    compounds used for treatment of cancer can exert both activities, but as a rule
    they modulate microtubule dynamics at concentrations significantly lower than
    those required to increase or decrease the microtubule polymer mass.', 'For example,
    taxol inhibits proliferation and mitosis in cultured tumor cells in the low nanomolar
    concentration range by suppressing microtubule dynamics, while the taxol concentration
    required to significantly increase the microtubule polymer mass is approximately
    10 fold higher.', 'Similarly, the vinca alkaloids, which inhibit microtubule polymerization
    at high concentrations, inhibit cell proliferation at their lowest effective concentrations
    by altering the dynamics of microtubules without depolymerizing the microtubules.',
  'Thus, the most potent actions of these drugs that lead to cell cycle arrest at
    mitosis and apoptotic cell death in cultured cells are on the dynamics of microtubules,
    not the quantity of assembled polymer,,.', 'Recently, we reported that sulforaphane
    inhibits proliferation and mitosis in MCF7 cells in the micromolar concentration
    range by suppressing microtubule dynamics and stabilizing microtubules in a manner
    similar to, but significantly weaker than that of clinically used microtubule
    targeting drugs.', 'Here, to understand and compare the antiproliferative and
    microtubule-targeting effects of erucin with those of sulforaphane, we analyzed
    the effects of erucin on proliferation, cell cycle progression, mitosis, apoptosis,
    and dynamic instability in MCF7 breast cancer cells stably transfected with enhanced
    green fluorescent protein EGFP--tubulin.', We also analyzed the effects of erucin
    on the polymerization and dynamics of microtubules assembled from purified tubulin
    in vitro., We found that erucin inhibits proliferation of MCF7 cells in parallel
    with inhibition of cell cycle progression at G2/M and mitosis in a manner consistent
    with impairment of spindle microtubule dynamics., 'In addition, erucin strongly
    suppressed microtubule growing and shortening dynamics during interphase without
    affecting the microtubule polymer mass and did so in similar fashion with microtubules
    made from purified tubulin in vitro.', 'Erucin also enhanced acetylation of microtubules
    in the cells, a marker for microtubule stabilization.', These results strongly
    support the hypothesis that suppression of microtubule dynamics by erucin is important
    in its ability to prevent cancer., All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich  unless
    otherwise noted., Erucin  was dissolved in 100% dimethylsulfoxide  and stored
    at 20C., 'Human MCF7 breast adenocarcinoma cells, expressing EGFP--tubulin, 1%
    penicillin-streptomycin, non-essential amino acids, pH 7.3, 37C.', MCF7-EGFP--tubulin
    cells were morphologically indistinguishable from MCF7 cells., 'The population
    doubling time of the cells was 34 hours, as compared with 29 hours for unmodified
    cells.', MCF7-EGFP--tubulin cells are referred to as MCF7 cells., Cell viability
    was assessed by a modified sulforhodamine B assay., 'Briefly, cells were seeded
    at 2104 cells per well in 96-well plates and incubated for 24 hours to allow cell
    attachment and recovery, incubated with erucin or vehicle control for 72 hours,
    fixed, stained, and the optical density  of each well was measured.', 'The erucin
    concentration that inhibited proliferation by 50%  was calculated as follows:
    100.', Results are the mean and SEM of at least three independent experiments.,
  Cells were seeded at 3104 cells per well  into six-well plates for 24 hours., Then
    the culture medium was replaced with erucin or vehicle control for 24 hours.,
  'Both floating and attached cells were collected and fixed in 10% formalin, followed
    by cold methanol.', 'Fixed cells were mounted on glass slides with ProLong Gold
    antifade reagent containing DAPI, and examined by immunofluorescence microscopy.',
  The percentage of mitotic cells was determined by counting at least 500 cells for
    each condition., Cell cycle analysis was performed using a Guava EasyCyte flow
    cytometer  equipped with Cytosoft software 2.0., 'Briefly, non-synchronized MCF7
    cells were seeded at 6104 cells in 2 ml for 24 hours, and incubated in the absence
    or presence of erucin for an additional 24 hours, harvested, fixed in cold 70%
    ethanol and stained using Guava Cell Cycle Reagent  according to the manufacturers
    protocol.', The DNA content of at least 5000 cells was measured for each condition.,
  Cell cycle distribution was analyzed by ModFit LT 3.1 software., Results are the
    mean and SEM of at least three independent experiments., 'To determine populations
    of viable, dead, and apoptotic cells in the presence of erucin, cells were incubated
    with erucin for 24 or 48 hours.', Apoptosis was determined using a Guava Nexin
    kit according to the manufacturers protocol on a Guava EasyCyte flow cytometer.,
  Data were analyzed using Guava Technologies software., Results are the means and
    SEM of at least three independent experiments for each condition., 'Cells were
    seeded on poly-L-lysine-treated coverslips at 6104 cells in 2 ml per well in six-well
    plates for 24 hours, incubated with erucin or vehicle control, fixed in 10% formalin
    in PBS  followed by 10 minutes in methanol, washed with PBS, and incubated with
    1% normal goat serum.', 'Cells were then incubated with mouse DM1 anti--tubulin
    antibody  for 1 hour at 37C, rinsed 3x in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin
    followed by incubation with goat anti-mouse FITC-conjugated secondary antibody  for
    1 hour at 37C.', 'After washing, coverslips were mounted on glass slides with
    ProLong Gold antifade reagent with DAPI  to visualize nuclei, and cells were imaged
    with a Photometrics CoolSNAP HQ digital camera.', 'To analyze the degree of microtubule
    acetylation, cells were treated and fixed as above and the microtubules were visualized
    with rabbit anti--tubulin primary  and secondary donkey anti-rabbit Rho  antibodies.',
  Acetylated microtubules were visualized with a mouse anti--acetylated tubulin primary
    antibody  and a secondary goat anti-mouse-FITC-conjugated antibody., The extent
    of microtubule acetylation in the absence and presence of 15 M and 30 M erucin
    was analyzed with ImageJ software., 'Specifically, the fluorescence intensity
    of acetylated microtubules  in at least 25 interphase MCF7 cells per condition
    was analyzed according to the formula: corrected total cell fluorescence  = Raw
    mean integrated density .', Only flat and well spread cells were analyzed., Mitotic
    cells could not be analyzed because they were too small and round with the stain
    concentrated in small areas., 'High concentrations of erucin  induced appreciable
    microtubule depolymerization and the majority of the cells were also round, thus
    preventing accurate measurement.', Analysis of microtubule dynamic instability
    was carried out as described previously., 'MCF7-EGFP--tubulin cells were seeded
    in six-well plates  on poly-L-lysine, laminin, and fibronectin coated coverslips
    for 24 hours in culture medium with 10% FBS and then for 24 hours in culture medium
    with 2% FBS to induce flattening, after which erucin was added at the desired
    concentrations for an additional 24 hours.', Video time-lapse images of microtubules
    in the thin peripheral regions of the cells were recorded as described previously.,
  Between 30 and 36 frames at 4-s intervals were taken with a 100X Nikon Plan Apo
    objective  on a Nikon Eclipse E800 microscope with a CoolSNAP HQ2 camera  under
    control of MetaMorph 4.9 software., 'The positions of plus ends were tracked and
    graphed as microtubule length vs. time life-history plots, and the dynamic instability
    parameters were determined as described previously.', Changes in length of  0.5
    m between two time points were considered growth or shortening events., Changes
    in length of ;0.5 m were considered periods of attenuated dynamics or pause.,
  The catastrophe frequency is the frequency of transition from the growth or attenuated  state
    to shortening., The rescue frequency is the frequency of transition from shortening
    to growth or the attenuated  state., 'Dynamicity is the sum of all growing and
    shortening events divided by the total time measured, including time spent in
    the attenuated state.', Microtubule protein consisting of 70% tubulin and 30%
    microtubule associated proteins  was isolated from bovine brains and MAP-depleted
    tubulin  was purified by phosphocellulose column chromatography and stored at
    70C as described previously., 'For experiments, the purified tubulin was thawed
    and centrifuged at 4C  to remove any aggregated or denatured tubulin.', 'Purified
    MAP-free tubulin  was polymerized in PEM buffer  in the absence or presence of
    erucin for 35 min at 35C, and then assembly was initiated with a suspension of
    sheared nucleating microtubule seeds prepared in 10% DMSO and 10% glycerol.',
  'The final volume of seed suspension to tubulin solution was 1:50.', 'The reaction
    mixtures were polymerized for an additional 60 min at 35C to achieve near steady
    state, and microtubule polymerization was monitored by turbidimetry at 350 nm
    using a Beckman DU 640 temperature controlled spectrophotometer.', 'To determine
    the microtubule polymer mass, microtubules assembled as above reaction were pelleted
    by centrifugation at 35000 RPM for 1 hour at 35C.', Microtubule pellets were solubilized
    in 0.2 M NaOH at 4C to determine protein concentration., The dynamic instability
    behavior at plus ends of individual purified microtubules was analyzed by video-enhanced
    differential interference contrast microscopy as described previously., 'Briefly,
    purified bovine brain tubulin was mixed with sea urchin axoneme seeds and polymerized
    to steady state at the ends of the seeds  in PMME buffer  in the presence or absence
    of erucin.', Microtubules were recorded for up to 60 minutes per slide., 'Microtubule
    lengths were measured every 35 s, plotted as length versus time, and analyzed
    using Real-Time Measurement software as described in,.', Erucin  inhibited MCF7
    cell proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner with 50% inhibition  occurring
    at a concentration of 28 M. Inhibition of proliferation occurred at the G2/M stage
    of the cell cycle as determined by flow cytometry., 'Specifically, 29% of a control
    cell population was in G2/M, consistent with previously published results with
    these cells.', 'After 24 hours of incubation, 50% of the cells were in G2/M at
    5 M erucin, 60% at 15 M erucin, and 69% at 25 M. These effects are very similar
    to those of sulforaphane, which inhibited MCF7 cell proliferation at an IC50 of
    26 M and induced 64% accumulation of cells at G2/M at a concentration of 25 M.


    Inhibition of cell cycle progression at G2M by erucin was associated with mitotic
    arrest.', 'Specifically, half-maximal accumulation of cells in mitosis at 24 hours
    occurred at 13 M erucin and maximal mitotic accumulation  occurred at 25 M erucin.',
  'The inhibitory effects of erucin on mitosis in MCF7 cells were similar to those
    reported previously for sulforaphane, which induced half-maximal accumulation
    of cells in mitosis at a concentration of 13 M.


    Similar to sulforaphane, erucin induced apoptosis in the cells in a time- and
    concentration-dependent manner.', 'Specifically, in control cells there were 3.7%
    and 4.2% apoptotic cells at 24 and 48 hours, respectively.', 'However, in the
    presence of 25 M erucin, a concentration approximately twice the IC50 for inhibition
    of mitosis, there was a 4.8- and 8.6-fold increase in the number of apoptotic
    cells at 24 and 48 hours, respectively compared with controls.', 'The extent of
    apoptotic cell death increased with higher erucin concentrations, reaching approximately
    25% at 24 hours and 45% at 48 hours compared with 3.7%  and 4.2%  in controls.',
  'To determine the effects of erucin on the interphase microtubule network and on
    the morphology of mitotic spindles, MCF7 cells were fixed and stained for microtubules
    and chromatin and examined by immunofluorescence microscopy.', Microtubules in
    control interphase cells formed a fine filamentous network throughout the cytoplasm
    that emanated from the microtubule-organizing center., Erucin concentrations as
    high as 15 M  did not change the interphase microtubule organization detectably
    and the microtubules themselves were indistinguishable from those in control interphase
    cells., 'In contrast, in the presence of 30 M erucin, the concentration that produced
    approximately maximum mitotic accumulation, there were fewer microtubules than
    in control cells and those that remained were short and curvy.', At high erucin
    concentrations  most cells became rounded and the microtubules were short and
    partially depolymerized., These effects are very similar to those produced by
    sulforaphane  and resemble those of other microtubule-depolymerizing agents like
    the vinca alkaloids., Figure 2., 'Concentration-dependence for the effects of
    erucin on cellular microtubule morphology, spindle morphology and microtubule
    acetylation in MCF7 cells.', 'Interphase control cells,  15 M,  30 M,  50 M, and  25
    M erucin.', Control cells and cells incubated with 15 M erucin show intact microtubule
    networks with similar overall morphologies., 'At 30 M erucin, microtubules were
    somewhat shorter, reduced in number, and very curvy.', 'At 50 M erucin, the majority
    of microtubules were depolymerized with the remaining microtubules clustered around
    nucleus.', Erucin also induced giant multinucleated cells  at low and especially
    at high concentrations., Metaphase spindles in control cells  were bipolar with
    all chromosomes congressed to the metaphase plate., 'The majority of cells arrested
    in mitosis by erucin displayed some abnormalities in metaphase: poorly defined
    bipolar spindles with uncongressed chromosomes  15 M erucin, arrowhead) and an
    increased number of astral microtubules  15 M erucin, arrows), or monopolar spindles
    that contained many uncongressed chromosomes  25 M erucin, arrowhead).', 'A, B,
    D, E, G, H, J, and K: chromosomes are blue, microtubules are green.', 'C, F, I,
    L: acetylated microtubules in the presence of 0100 M erucin.', Erucin promotes
    acetylation of microtubules in MCF7 cells in a concentration-dependent manner.,
  In control cells the majority of microtubules are dynamic  with a very few acetylated
    microtubules., 'At 15 M erucin, there were more stabilized  microtubules compared
    with those in controls.', 'At 30 M erucin, there were fewer microtubules, and
    the majority of remaining microtubules were curved and acetylated.', In the presence
    of 50 M erucin the majority of microtubules were depolymerized and strongly acetylated.,
  'Overall, the dynamics of microtubules was significantly stabilized by erucin, reducing
    the microtubule turnover.', 'C, F, I, L: chromosomes are blue, microtubules are
    red, acetylated microtubules are green.', 'Scale bar is 10 m.


    Mitotic spindles in control cells displayed well-formed bipolar mitotic spindles
    with all chromosomes in metaphase cells congressed to a compact central region
    between the two well-separated spindle poles.', Normal spindles also displayed
    very few astral microtubules at the spindle poles., Erucin induced structural
    and functional spindle abnormalities at concentrations that did not detectably
    alter interphase microtubule organization., 'At 15 M erucin, approximately 5%
    of the metaphase spindles appeared normal with properly duplicated and separated
    centrosomes, a compact metaphase plate with no lagging chromosomes, and very few
    astral microtubules at the spindle poles.', 'Approximately 25% of the spindles
    were still bipolar at 15 M erucin, but they displayed abnormalities such as having
    several uncongressed chromosomes located at the spindle poles.', 'In contrast
    to mitotic spindles in control cells, which contained only a few astral microtubules,
    erucin-treated spindles displayed a relatively high number of astral microtubules.',
  Approximately 70% of the arrested mitotic cells displayed chromosomes that were
    arranged in a ball surrounding monopolar spindles in which centrosomes were not
    separated properly., 'At 25 M erucin, the concentration that induced the highest
    degree of mitotic arrest, monopolar spindles with uncongressed chromosomes predominated,
    the spindle microtubules emanated from the center of monopolar spindles, and the
    number of giant multinucleated cells increased to approximately 15.6%  compared
    with 1.2% in controls.', The mitotic spindle aberrations induced by erucin were
    very similar to those induced by sulforaphane., 'Interestingly, microtubule-targeting
    drugs such as the taxanes and the vinca alkaloids produce similar spindle abnormalities.',
  The ratio of the number of cells in anaphase to the number of cells in metaphase
    during mitosis is a reflection of cell passage through the metaphase to anaphase
    transition., The anaphase/metaphase ratio in control cells was 0.55., 'In contrast,
    at 15 M erucin the anaphase/metaphase ratio was only 0.09, a 6-fold decrease,
    indicating that erucin strongly slowed or prevented cells from transiting from
    metaphase to anaphase.', 'This is also occurred with sulforaphane, and is similar
    to what occurs with more potent microtubule targeting drugs such as taxol and
    the vinca alkaloids.', 'While erucin at the IC50 for mitotic arrest did not detectably
    affect the organization and/or structure of microtubules during interphase, it
    did strongly affect the dynamic instability behavior of the microtubules.', Typical
    images of interphase microtubules in control cells are shown in Fig., 3 A  and
    microtubules in cells incubated with 15 M erucin for 24 hours are shown in Fig.,
  3 B., 'In control cells, the plus ends of microtubules  alternated in normal fashion
    among periods of relatively slow growth, rapid shortening, and pause, a state
    of attenuated dynamic activity that is below the resolution of the microscope.',
  'Microtubules in control cells grew at a mean rate of 14.51.07 m/min, and shortened
    at 22.41.7 m/min.', 'Control cell microtubules also spent approximately 42% of
    their total time in the paused or attenuated state, neither growing nor shortening
    detectably.', Figure 3., Dynamic instability of microtubules in MCF7 cells incubated
    with erucin., 'Time-lapse sequences of fluorescent microtubules at their plus
    ends: the positions of microtubule plus ends were tracked over time to generate
    life history plots in the absence  or presence  of 15 M erucin, from which the
    dynamic instability parameters were calculated.', Most microtubules in control
    cells grew  and shortened  within the course of the 2-min observation period.,
  The dynamics were significantly suppressed by 15 M erucin., 'Bar = 5 m.  Concentration-dependent
    suppression of microtubule dynamics parameters in MCF7 cells by erucin: the growth
    rate, growth length, shortening rate, shortening length, and dynamicity.', Data
    are from Table 1., Table 1., Effects of Erucin on Dynamic Instability of Microtubules
    in MCF7-EGFP--Tubulin Breast Cancer Cells., Erucin strongly suppressed the dynamic
    instability parameters of the microtubules in a concentration-dependent manner.,
  We quantified the effects of 515 M erucin  on the dynamic instability behavior of
    interphase microtubules that displayed dynamic activity., 'Notably, approximately
    60% of the microtubules were strongly stabilized at 15 M erucin.', As shown in
    Table 1 and Fig., '3 C, 15 M erucin reduced the growth rate and length grown during
    a growth event by 29% and 30%, respectively.', It suppressed the shortening rate
    and shortening length more effectively., 'The time-based catastrophe frequency
    was decreased 30%, the rescue frequency was increased 27%, and the overall dynamicity
    was suppressed by 46%.', The effective suppression of dynamicity and stabilization
    of microtubules in MCF7 cells by erucin strongly resemble the effects of sulforaphane
    in these cells., 'Acetylation of tubulin in microtubules is a marker for microtubule
    turnover and stability, with increased acetylation correlating with decreased
    turnover and increased stability.', The effects of erucin as visualized with an
    antibody against acetylated -tubulin are shown in., 'Few microtubules were acetylated
    in control cells, while incubation of cells with erucin for 24 hours resulted
    in a significant concentration-dependent increase in the extent of microtubule
    acetylation.', 'Specifically, microtubule acetylation based upon the intensity
    of staining of acetylated tubulin in microtubules after treatment with 15 and
    30 M erucin increased approximately 3 and 4.4 fold, respectively, compared with
    that in control cells.', 'At high concentrations of erucin, the majority of microtubules
    were depolymerized, and the remaining microtubules were highly acetylated and,
    preventing the accurate assessment of acetylation in these cells.', 'Similar results
    were obtained with sulforaphane  and with another microtubule-destabilizing drug,
    estramustine.', 'Thus, at erucin concentrations that inhibited mitosis but did
    not affect the quantity or arrangement of microtubules in the MCF7 cells during
    interphase, erucin nevertheless suppressed the dynamics of the microtubules.',
  'It is reasonable to think that such suppression of microtubule dynamics perturbs
    the functions of interphase microtubules, such as their critical roles in cell
    migration and metastasis.', 'Inhibition of microtubule polymerization by microtubule-destabilizing
    drugs  requires much higher drug concentrations than those necessary to suppress
    microtubule dynamics,.', This also occurs with erucin., 'Erucin did inhibit polymerization
    of purified bovine brain tubulin into microtubules, but it did so relatively weakly.',
  'Specifically, 15 M erucin did not appreciably alter the rate or extent of microtubule
    polymerization, while 25 M erucin only partially inhibited the extent of polymerization.',
  Appreciable reduction of microtubule polymer mass required very high erucin concentrations  with
    close to complete inhibition of polymerization occurring at 100 M erucin., 'Also,
    high erucin concentrations of 75 M induced formation of tubulin aggregates as
    determined by electron microscopy.', 'Polymerization of purified tubulin, pre-incubated
    with or without the drug for 35 minutes, was carried out at 35C by initiation
    with nucleating microtubule seeds  in the absence  control, or presence of  15,  25,  50
    M, and  100 M erucin for 60 minutes.', Total microtubule polymer mass was determined
    by centrifugation 60 minutes after the initiation of assembly., Bars are  SEM.,
  Values with are significantly different from control at 95% confidence interval
    by Students t-test., 'Similar to its actions in MCF7 cells, concentrations of
    erucin that were not high enough to affect the rate or extent of assembly of purified
    microtubules  strongly suppressed dynamic instability of these microtubules at
    their plus ends in a concentration-dependent manner.', As shown in Fig., '5 A,
    control microtubules underwent slow growth and rapid shortening and spent relatively
    little time in an attenuated state.', 'In contrast, at 15 M erucin, microtubules
    were strongly stabilized, growing and shortening more slowly than control microtubules,
    while spending more time in an attenuated  state.', Figure 5., Concentration-dependent
    suppression of dynamic instability at microtubule plus-ends in vitro by erucin.,
  Microtubule ends were tracked over time to produce life history plots of individual
    microtubules assembled in vitro from purified bovine brain tubulin., 'Life history
    plots are the length changes of individual microtubules in controls, and in the
    presence of 15 M erucin.', 'Concentration-dependent suppression of microtubule
    dynamics parameters in vitro by erucin: the growth rate, growth length, shortening
    rate, shortening length, and dynamicity.', Data are from Table 2., Table 2., Effects
    of Erucin on Dynamic Instability of Steady-State Purified Microtubules in Vitro.,
  'Specifically, 15 M erucin reduced the growth rate and the length grown during a
    growing event by approximately 32% and 50%, respectively.', 'It also reduced the
    mean shortening rate by 54%, the length of a shortening excursion by 52%, the
    catastrophe frequency by 33%, and the rescue frequency by 21%.', It increased
    the fraction of time the microtubules spent in an attenuated state  and it reduced
    the overall dynamicity of the microtubules by 73%., 'These effects of erucin on
    the dynamic instability parameters of purified microtubules are qualitatively
    similar to its effects on the dynamics parameters of microtubules in living interphase
    MCF7 cells, indicating that the effects of erucin on microtubule dynamics in cells
    are due to a direct action on the microtubules.', 'We have examined the antimitotic
    and antiproliferative mechanism of action of erucin, the major isothiocyanate
    present in Rocket salad species.', We found that in MCF7 cells erucin acts very
    similarly to the structurally-related isothiocyanate sulforaphane., Erucins main
    cellular effects are  inhibition of cell proliferation;  cell cycle arrest at
    G2/M;  suppression of microtubule dynamic instability in the interphase cytoplasm
    of the cells;  and induction of apoptosis., 'In addition, erucins effects on the
    dynamics and polymerization of microtubules made from purified tubulin were similar
    to those in cells, indicating that its effects on microtubule dynamics in cells
    are due to a direct action on the microtubules.', 'Erucin inhibited proliferation
    of MCF7 cells in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC50 of 28 M, and it
    arrested cell cycle progression at mitosis with an approximately similar IC50,
    suggesting that inhibition of proliferation by erucin is associated with inhibition
    of mitosis.', 'Similar to the action of sulforaphane, inhibition of mitosis by
    erucin appears to be caused by suppression of spindle microtubule dynamics.',
  Inhibition of mitosis by erucin occurred at prometaphase/metaphase and was accompanied
    by formation of abnormal bipolar and monopolar spindles with improperly distributed
    chromosomes., 'For example, at 15 M erucin, many arrested mitotic spindles had
    a nearly normal complement of microtubules, but had one or several chromosomes
    remaining at the spindle poles unable to move to the metaphase plate.', 'Monopolar
    spindles predominated at 25 M erucin, the concentration that induced maximum mitotic
    accumulation, indicating that at this concentration, cells were unable to build
    and/or maintain a functional bipolar spindle.', 'Significantly, cells arrested
    at mitosis by erucin, which displayed abnormal chromosome and spindle microtubule
    organizations similar to those induced by sulforaphane, were also similar to the
    abnormal spindles induced by more potent microtubule-targeting anticancer drugs
    such as taxanes and the vinca alkaloids,.', 'Suppression of spindle microtubule
    dynamics by these drugs causes several well-documented effects on mitotic spindle
    organization and function,.', They perturb spindle microtubule organization and
    prevent the chromosomes from properly attaching to the spindle microtubules and
    moving to the metaphase plate., 'For example, in Hela cells low concentrations
    of vinca alkaloids  induce formation of spindles with longer, and more prominent
    astral microtubules than those of normal spindles, often with one or more chromosomes
    at one or both spindle poles rather than at the metaphase plate.', 'The same occurs
    with the taxanes, maytansinoids, and eribulin.', Suppression of dynamics by chemotherapeutic
    microtubule-targeted drugs reduces the tension at the kinetochores of the chromosomes
    and the cells fail to satisfy the mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint., 'Cells
    undergo a prolonged mitotic arrest and/or aberrant mitotic exit associated with
    formation of multinucleated cells and eventually die by apoptosis,.', 'Indeed,
    similarly to microtubule-targeted drugs and its analog sulforaphane, erucin induced
    the formation of multinucleated cells with the number of such cells increasing
    13-fold at 25 M erucin.', 'Erucin treatment also resulted in a time- and concentration-dependent
    induction of apoptosis, with 25 M erucin increasing apoptosis from approximately
    4% in controls to 18% at 24 hours and to 31% at 48 hours.', 'In further support
    of the idea that erucin arrests cell proliferation at mitosis by perturbing microtubule
    dynamics, we determined directly that it suppressed microtubule dynamic instability
    in the peripheral regions of MCF7 cells during interphase.', 'Specifically, 15
    M erucin, inhibited most dynamic instability parameters normally displayed by
    microtubules, including the rates and extents of growth and shortening and the
    transition frequencies between growth and shortening.', 'Erucin also increased
    the extent to which interphase microtubules were acetylated, an indicator of decreased
    microtubule turnover and stabilized dynamics,.', Erucin also suppressed the dynamic
    instability of microtubules made from purified tubulin in vitro in a manner almost
    indistinguishable from the way it suppressed microtubule dynamic instability in
    MCF7 cells., 'Both, the growth and shortening parameters and the dynamicity were
    suppressed in vitro by low concentrations of erucin.', 'These results indicate
    that erucin is acting in cells directly on the microtubules themselves without
    substantially modifying the soluble tubulin levels, which would change the total
    polymer mass.', 'High concentrations of erucin  did inhibit microtubule polymerization
    both in cells and in vitro, but the concentrations required to inhibit polymerization
    were much higher than those required to arrest mitosis and suppress dynamics of
    the microtubules in cells and to suppress the dynamics of purified microtubules.',
  'This ability of erucin to suppress microtubule dynamics at concentrations well
    below those required to inhibit or increase the polymer mass, is mechanistically
    similar to the way the taxanes, the vinca alkaloids and many other microtubule
    targeting anti-mitotic agents, including sulforaphane, act.', These agents suppress
    microtubule dynamics at concentrations below those required to increase  or decrease  the
    microtubule polymer mass., 'Among the anti-mitotic microtubule-targeted drugs
    that suppress microtubule dynamics, erucins specific actions on the various dynamics
    parameters, despite its much lower toxicity, most closely resemble those of vinblastine.',
  'Both erucin and vinblastine inhibit microtubule growth and shortening, while several
    other microtubule-depolymerizing drugs such as vinflunine and eribulin do not
    appreciably inhibit shortening.', 'While the mechanism by which erucin binds to
    tubulin or microtubules remains to be determined, one possibility is that it acts
    by covalent modification of a critical sulfhydryl residue of tubulin.', 'Indeed,
    a study by Mi et al.', 'demonstrated that cysteines in tubulin are covalently
    modified by several isothiocyanates, including sulforaphane.', 'Consumption of
    cruciferous vegetables, especially broccoli, broccoli sprouts and arugula is highly
    prevalent in the human diet.', It seems clear that the anticancer and chemoprotective
    actions of erucin and sulforaphane occur at concentrations that are achievable
    in the human diet., 'Isothiocyanates, including erucin and sulforaphane, are rapidly
    taken up into cells  as glutathione  conjugates.', 'Erucin and sulforaphane have
    similar absorption rates, elimination rates of their respective metabolites, and
    similar average bio-availabilities,.', 'It is interesting that that erucin and
    sulforaphane  exhibit microtubule-targeting activities that are qualitatively
    similar to those exerted by highly cytotoxic microtubule-targeting anticancer
    drugs, including taxanes, vincas, eribulin, and maytansinoids.', 'However, when
    ingested at normal levels in cruciferous vegetables, isothiocyanates are not toxic.',
  The reason for the lack of toxicity is probably due to the relatively low potency
    of the isothiocyanates as compared with the more powerful microtubule targeting
    drugs., 'Specifically, impairment of cellular microtubule functions in MCF7 cells
    occurs in the nanomolar range with taxanes and the vinca alkaloids, as opposed
    to the micromolar range with the isothiocyanates, a 1000 fold potency difference.',
  'Recent evidence indicates that isothiocyanates can exert their anticancer activity
    alone and in combination with chemotherapeutic microtubule-targeting drugs to
    synergistically enhance cancer cell death,.', It seems reasonable to suggest that
    suppression of microtubule dynamics and impairment of highly sensitive microtubule
    functions by erucin and other isothiocyanates may be important in preventing and
    or retarding proliferation or migration of pre-malignant and/or malignant cells.,
