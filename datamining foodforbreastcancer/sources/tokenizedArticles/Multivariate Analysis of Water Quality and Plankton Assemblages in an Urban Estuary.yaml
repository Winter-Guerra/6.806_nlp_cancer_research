text: ['Raritan Bay, located between the states of New York and New Jersey, has a
    long history of cultural eutrophication and associated harmful algal blooms.',
  'Despite striking chemical and biological alterations occurring in Raritan Bay,
    publications in the early 1960s were the last to report consecutive measurements
    of both water quality parameters and plankton species composition in this system.',
  'The objectives of this study were to characterize water quality trends and plankton
    composition in a eutrophic estuary, compare current environmental conditions to
    those documented in Raritan Bay 50 years ago, and to further clarify the relationship
    among nutrients, secondary consumers, and algal bloom generation in this system
    using ordination techniques.', 'This study  indicates that Raritan Bay continues
    to exhibit numerous symptoms of eutrophication, including high algal biomass,
    high turbidity, violations of the dissolved oxygen standard to protect fish health,
    and blooms of potentially harmful phytoplankton species.', 'Altered spatial and
    temporal patterns for nitrate and soluble reactive phosphorus  over the past 50
    years may suggest new, changing, or expanding sources of nutrients.', 'A total
    of 14 HAB species have been identified, including Heterosigma akashiwo, which
    formed a bloom in the upper Raritan Bay during summer 2012 in association with
    hypoxic conditions.', 'Multivariate analyses indicate that abundance of this species
    is positively associated with high temperature, salinity, nitrate, and SRP and
    negatively associated with spring river discharge rates and total zooplankton
    abundance in Raritan Bay.', Environmental monitoring and assessments of nearshore
    coastal ecosystems have become critical as human populations expand and intensify
    the strain on these ecologically and economically important systems., 'Concentrated
    human activities have accelerated fluxes of nutrients to coastal waters and led
    to cultural eutrophication and associated increases in productivity, simplification
    of aquatic communities, and ecosystem instability.', 'Of particular concern in
    eutrophic coastal ecosystems is the stimulation of harmful algal blooms, which
    cause environmental damage by depleting available oxygen, reducing light availability,
    disrupting recreational uses, and/or producing toxins harmful to other organisms
    including humans.', 'In recent decades, there has been a global increase in the
    reported number of HABs.', 'Few coastal environments have been left unaltered
    by the effects of anthropogenic eutrophication, and it is clearly one of the major
    environmental problems facing coastal resource managers.', 'The HudsonRaritan
    estuary  of New York and New Jersey is one of the most urbanized estuaries, and
    busiest ports, in the world.', 'Not surprisingly, this system has a long history
    of environmental degradation.', 'Public policy debates regarding waste disposal
    and water pollution began as early as the sevententh century, and by the turn
    of the twentieth century, shoreline development, discharges of industrial waste,
    and inadequate waste disposal methods led to collapse of the oyster industry,
    reduced fish abundance and diversity, beach closures, nutrient enrichment, and
    severe oxygen depletion  2007).', 'The present study aims to build upon current
    understanding of the coastal eutrophication process by evaluating linkages among
    nutrient concentrations and phytoplankton and zooplankton assemblage composition
    in the Raritan Bay ecosystem, located at the southern portion of Lower New York
    Bay between the states of New York and New Jersey.', 'Although historical water
    quality data for this system exist, current information on water quality characteristics
    in relation to plankton dynamics is lacking.', 'In addition, more recent studies
    in this system focus primarily on sediment contamination, heavy metals, and bioaccumulation
    of persistent organic pollutants.', 'To our knowledge, publications by Jeffries  in
    the early 1960s were the last to report on the results of both nutrient and plankton
    dynamics in Raritan Bay for a period of longer than 1 year.', 'Even then, Jeffries  reported
    that rich nutrient supplies and a sluggish circulation were contributing to extremely
    dense plankton populations and low summer dissolved oxygen concentrations.', 'Interestingly,
    when Jeffries conducted his study in Raritan Bay, cultural eutrophication was
    not yet perceived as a widespread problem in the coastal marine environment.',
  'However, it was around this time  that scientists first made the connection between
    nutrient loading from the land and intensive coastal algal blooms and began expressing
    serious concern about eutrophication after conducting research in this region
    of the Long Island Sound and the New York Bight, which includes Raritan Bay.',
  'Therefore, our intent was not only to complete a multiyear study of water quality
    and plankton dynamics in a eutrophic estuary but also to collect environmental
    data from the same six sampling sites in Raritan Bay monitored in this system
    by Jeffries, so that current environmental conditions could be compared to those
    documented in this system more than 50 years ago.', Another indicator of the long-term
    water quality degradation of the Raritan Bay is the large phytoplankton blooms
    that have occurred annually in this system for decades., 'Eutrophication problems,
    such as HABs, cannot be diagnosed by studies and monitoring programs that focus
    on algal chlorophyll biomass alone.', 'Yet, previous studies in Raritan Bay do
    not include plankton identifications to the genus or species level or analysis
    of changes in phytoplankton species composition in relation to both bottom up  and
    top down  effects.', 'As a result, this study also aims to further clarify the
    relationships among habitat characteristics, nutrient concentrations, plankton
    species composition, and algal bloom generation.', This satisfies an urgent need
    in this system and in general to better understand the environmental conditions
    contributing to the success of individual species and leading to the generation
    of phytoplankton blooms in estuaries., 'Here, we address variation in phytoplankton
    species composition using ordination, which has been described as a group of methods
    for data reduction leading to hypothesis generation.', Ordination techniques are
    especially useful for analyzing community data because they reveal the strongest
    patterns in species composition by representing complex ecological relations in
    low-dimensional space  and provide interpretations of speciesenvironment relationships.,
  'This represents one of the few available studies, and the first for the Raritan
    Bay ecosystem, to include accurate and consistent data over a 3-year period on
    phytoplankton assemblage composition in relation to both nutrients and zooplankton
    composition and to use ordination techniques to evaluate linkages among these
    parameters.', 'This approach, which can be adapted to examining the eutrophication
    process in other coastal systems, will aid in predicting biological changes under
    certain circumstances and identifying where corrective measures are most necessary.',
  'The Raritan River flows ~26 km through the central New Jersey Highlands and Piedmont
    before slowing in tidewater at New Brunswick, and its estuary extends another
    ~23 km before entering Raritan Bay at South Amboy.', 'The Raritan River Basin,
    the largest river basin in NJ, comprises approximately 2,850 km2 and contains
    approximately 1.2 million people.', 'Land use is primarily woodlands, suburban
    and agricultural in the upper RRB, and the lower RRB is dominated by urban/suburban
    land use with industrial and commercial centers throughout.', Water quality studies
    within the basin have indicated that total phosphorus  and fecal coliform bacteria
    are two of the water quality parameters that most commonly fail to meet New Jersey
    reference levels., 'Permitted point source dischargers in the RRB, which include
    &gt;575 wastewater treatment facilities  concentrated in Middlesex County surrounding
    the mouth of the Raritan River ), account for more than one third of the TP and
    one third of the nitrate load at low- and median-flow conditions.', Most municipal
    WWTPs were upgraded to full secondary treatment during the 1970s and 1980s., 'In
    the earlier part of the century, however, both New York and New Jersey communities
    were discharging raw sewage into the HRE.', Incremental constructions and upgrades
    of sewage treatment plants over the past few decades have yielded long-term improvements
    in water quality., 'However, one of the remaining water pollution problems in
    this system results from combined sewer overflows following storms that discharge
    raw sewage and street debris.', 'For example, damage caused by hurricane Sandy
    on 29 October 2012 took several WWTPs offline in New Jersey, and raw sewage carrying
    high levels of fecal coliform bacteria, nutrients, and pollutants emptied into
    New Jerseys rivers and estuaries.', 'Nevertheless, nonpoint sources continue to
    be the largest source of nutrient loads in the RRB, and studies have shown that
    these nonpermitted yields of nutrients are most highly correlated with septic
    system density and other factors related to urban areas.', 'Water quality data
    in Raritan Bay indicate that, despite significant progress following abatement
    measures, the system is still polluted.', 'The water and sediments are contaminated
    with a variety of pollutants such as heavy metals, PCBs, polynuclear aromatic
    hydrocarbons, and pesticides.', 'Excessive nutrient loads also continue to degrade
    water quality by contributing to algal blooms, hypoxia, and fish kills.', 'Chronic
    phytoplankton blooms of various species, including the dinoflagellates Ceratium
    tripos  Nitzsch, Prorocentrum micans Ehrenberg, and Heterocapsa rotundata  Hansen,
    and the raphidophyte Heterosigma akashiwo  Hada ex Hada et Chihara  have occurred
    in the HRE and New Jersey coastal waters for over three decades.', 'These blooms
    have been associated with moderate bather discomfort and/or illness, diminished
    esthetic value of beaches, hypoxia, and fish mortality.', Six sites in Raritan
    Bay  were sampled on a monthly basis from April through November., The estuarine
    water quality study extended from April 2010 through October 2012., 'It was not
    possible to sample in November 2012 and complete three full years of sampling
    due to damage caused by hurricane Sandy to the Atlantic Highlands marina on October
    29, 2012.', 'Water temperature, salinity, pH, and dissolved oxygen  were determined
    using a YSI 6820 V2 multiparameter meter, which was calibrated prior to each sample
    period.', Water transparency was assessed using Secchi depth data., 'A vertical
    polycarbonate Van Dorn water sampler  was thoroughly rinsed with site water and
    used to collect water samples near the surface, at mid-depth, and low depth  between
    1000 and 1200 hours local time for biological and chemical analyses.', 'Samples
    for nutrient analyses were poured into acid-cleaned bottles, maintained in darkness
    on ice for transport to the laboratory, and refrigerated or frozen as appropriate
    until analysis.', Phytoplankton samples were poured into amber bottles and preserved
    with acidic Lugols solution on site., Zooplankton samples were collected at a
    depth of 1.5 m using a 12-l SchindlerPatalas trap and preserved with 4 % buffered
    formalin., All plankton samples were held at 4 C until analysis., 'A Nalgene hand
    vacuum pump and gridded 0.45-m membrane  was used on site to filter 200 mL of
    sample water for analysis of chlorophyll a, and filters were placed in opaque
    canisters and maintained on ice until analysis.', 'The Raritan River Basin and
    Bay, showing the six sampling stations for temperature, salinity, pH, dissolved
    oxygen, Secchi depth, nutrient concentrations, phytoplankton biomass as chlorophyll
    a, phytoplankton and zooplankton assemblages.', Samples were collected from 20102012
    on a monthly basis., "These are six of the same sampling sites monitored for nutrients
    and zooplankton assemblages by Jeffries \n\nNutrient analyses were performed using
    standard methods.", 'Concentrations of all nutrients, except for total iron, were
    determined colorimetrically with a HACH  DR/2500 spectrophotometer.', 'Accuracy
    checks, including the use of reagent blanks and standard solution adjusts, followed
    HACH procedures.', 'Nitrate  was determined within 12 h of collection using the
    method of cadmium reduction, and the Nessler method was used within 24 h for determination
    of ammonium.', Samples for the analysis of soluble reactive phosphorus  were first
    filtered in the field with a Whatman Puradisc 0.45-m syringe filter and analyzed
    within 48 h using the ascorbic acid-molybdate blue method., 'Silicon  and ferrous
    iron  were also determined colorimetrically using the silicomolybdate and 1,1,10
    phenanthroline methods, respectively.', Samples for the analysis of ferrous iron
    were analyzed as soon as possible after collection  to prevent oxidation of ferrous
    to ferric iron., Samples for analysis of total iron were preserved with concentrated
    nitric acid to adjust the pH to ~2 and sent to Penn State Agricultural Analytical
    Services laboratory for analysis via inductively-coupled plasmaatomic emission
    spectrometry as per EPA method 200.7., 'All chlorophyll extractions were performed
    using 90 % basic acetone, and spectrophometric analyses  were conducted within
    48 h of sample collection.', 'Phytoplankton counts were conducted using a Palmer
    Maloney cell  under a Leica DM 1000 phase contrast microscope, and cells were
    identified and counted until at least 100 specimens of the most common species
    were counted.', 'Taxa abundances, including colonial and filamentous forms, were
    quantified by enumerating single cells, and identifications were taken to the
    lowest taxonomic level.', 'Many identifications were taken to genus or species
    level, but for some flagellates, individual genera were difficult to consistently
    differentiate from one another in preserved samples and were mostly identified
    to the class level.', 'Pfiesteria piscicida Steidinger and Burkholder, Pfiesteria
    shumwayae Glasgow and Burkholder, cryptoperidiniopsoids, and other physically
    similar taxa were classified as Pfiesteria-like under light microscopy.', 'In
    the case of obvious phytoplankton blooms and water discoloration, fresh samples
    were brought back to the laboratory for easier identification of bloom-forming
    species.', 'For the purpose of this study, a bloom is defined as two standard
    deviations above the 3-year mean phytoplankton biomass.', 'For enumeration of
    zooplankton, a subsample of ~10 % of the total sample was examined.', 'Counts
    were conducted using a Sedgewick Rafter counting cell, also under a Leica DM 1000
    phase contrast microscope.', Identifications were taken to genus or species level
    according to Todd et al., and Johnson and Allen., Juvenile or nauplii stages of
    zooplankton were counted separately from their adult stage because of differential
    feeding patterns  and difficulty in identifying them to genus level under light
    microscopy., Mnemiopsis leidyi Agazzi were roughly quantified at each sampling
    site by counting the number of individuals in SchindlerPatalas samples prior to
    preservation., 'Paired, two-sample t tests were used for between-site and between-year
    comparisons of water quality and plankton abundance.', All analyses were performed
    at an alpha level of 0.05., 'Phytoplankton and zooplankton data were compiled
    into separate matrices of cell number by site and sample date, resulting in a
    final matrix of 78 columns of phytoplankton cell counts and 40 columns of zooplankton
    counts by 138 sample rows.', 'To reduce the noise  in the plankton datasets and
    enhance detection of assemblage patterns in relation to environmental parameters,
    rare taxa  were removed prior to analysis, and abundances of the remaining 41
    phytoplankton species and 32 zooplankton species were log transformed after 1
    was added as a constant.', Every plankton sample used in the analysis had a corresponding
    suite of physical and chemical measurements  that could be related to ordinations
    by species composition., 'Dissolved N/P and Si/N ratios, precipitation data and
    Raritan River discharge rates were also included in the analyses because previous
    studies have indicated that they are important factors governing phytoplankton
    species composition and bloom development.', 'Precipitation data were acquired
    from the New Jersey Weather and Climate Network, and precipitation was determined
    for each sample by summing the total amount of rainfall at the New Brunswick station  for
    the week prior to the sampling date.', 'Raritan River discharge rates were acquired
    from US Geological Survey  at Bound Brook, which is approximately 20 km upstream
    from the upper edge of the study area at site 1.', 'Season, site, and year were
    all included in the nonmetric multidimensional scaling  analyses  as categorical
    variables.', 'Ordination techniques, which order samples along axes expressing
    the main trends or gradients in the data, were used to investigate potential environmental
    predictors of phytoplankton and zooplankton assemblage patterns.', 'NMDS, considered
    the most effective ordination method for ecological data, was used to establish
    seasonal and site-to-site differences in plankton assemblage structure and to
    interpret those differences in terms of environmental conditions.', All NMDS ordinations  were
    carried out using PC-ORD version 5.0 software., 'Descriptions of the five datasets
    used for NMDS ordinations, and the questions targeted by each of those ordinations.',
  'The various data groupings were chosen to better extract and compare phytoplankton
    species variation between seasons and years and develop hypotheses about long-term
    relationships among phytoplankton assemblage structure, individual nuisance or
    harmful species, environmental factors, and zooplankton composition.', 'The 16
    quantitative environmental variables were Raritan River discharge rates, precipitation,
    water temperature, salinity, pH, DO, Secchi depth, nitrate, ammonium, SRP, silica,
    ferrous iron, total iron, chlorophyll a, N/P ratio, and Si/P ratio, and the three
    categorical values were year, season, and site.', "Rare species  were removed
    and phytoplankton cell numbers were log transformed prior to the analysis  \n\nDuring
    this study, the RRB was affected by two tropical cyclones and record-breaking
    late winter and early spring precipitation totals in 2010 and 2011, all associated
    with high flooding in the region  National Hurricane Center  2013, Office of the
    New Jersey State Climatologist  2010; 2011).", 'The study began in April 2010,
    the warmest April on record since 1895 in New Jersey, following the wettest March
    on record.', The result of large amounts of rain falling on soils still wet from
    recently melting snows was high river discharge and near-record flooding in the
    RRB in spring 2010., 'In marked contrast, drought conditions developed in the
    coastal counties of the RRB during summer 2010.', 'Temperature, precipitation,
    and river discharge were again well above the state average in April 2011 following
    major precipitation events and flooding in March.', 'In August 2011, tropical
    storm Irene caused catastrophic flooding in the New Jersey and New York regions
    with 1.0 to 1.5 m storm surges.', 'At Sandy Hook, NJ, wind speeds were recorded
    at 40 kt with storm surges of 1.4 m. Overall, 2011 was an extremely high-precipitation
    year, setting a 100-year record for the state of New Jersey.', 'In contrast to
    the first 2 years of the study, spring precipitation was below average and summer
    precipitation was near average in 2012.', 'However, hurricane Sandy, which made
    landfall along the coast of New Jersey, caused major damage to both the New Jersey
    and New York coastlines.', 'Although precipitation totals associated with the
    storm were less than predicted, hurricane Sandy arrived close to spring high tide
    and created a record storm surge in Raritan Bay at Sandy Hook of &gt;3.0 m.


    Monthly mean Raritan River discharge rates  measured by US Geological Survey at
    Bound Brook, and monthly precipitation totals  for New Brunswick  acquired from
    the New Jersey Weather &amp; Climate Network from April 2010 through October 2012


    Seasonal, interannual, and site-specific variability in temperature and salinity
    occurred in this ecosystem, and both continue to reflect the circulation patterns
    in Raritan Bay described by Jeffries.', 'Flood tides carry high-salinity water
    northward past Sandy Hook and sites 6 and 4 toward an area of extensive eddies
    where it mixes with freshwater from the river, and freshwater enters the bay from
    the Raritan River and flows southward past site 3.', 'As a result, site 6 still
    has significantly lower temperature  than site 5.', 'Site 6 also has a significantly
    higher salinity  than site 5, particularly during spring months.', 'Surface salinities,
    which ranged from 15 to 34, were dependent on seasonal precipitation patterns
    and river discharge rates.', 'In 2010 and 2012, salinity throughout the bay was
    lowest in June following the high river flow months of spring and gradually increased
    through summer and fall as precipitation and discharge declined.', 'In contrast,
    during the record-wet year of 2011 with high-precipitation events continuing through
    summer, salinity remained low through summer.', Salinity stratification  was generally
    greatest at site 1 and least pronounced at site 6 where water stratification is
    reduced by tidal mixing., 'Overall, salinity levels and patterns are similar to
    those reported for this system 50 years ago  except during spring months when
    salinity was 1.5 times higher than reported by Jeffries.', 'Seasonal mean   1SE
    and median levels for each water quality variable measured in Raritan Bay for
    2010, 2011, and 2012.', 'Seasonal categories are spring, AprilMay; summer, JuneSeptember;
    and fall, OctoberNovember.', 'Water temperature is reported in degrees Celsius;
    dissolved oxygen is reported in milligrams per liter; chlorophyll a, NO3 , NH4
    +, soluble reactive phosphorus, silica, ferrous iron, and total iron are reported
    in micrograms per liter.', "Analysis of ferrous and total iron began in July 2010

    \ between 1958  and 20102012.", 'Jeffries did not provide seasonal mean values
    for these parameters at sites 2, 3, and 4.', 'Seasonal categories are spring,
    AprilMay; summer, JuneSeptember; and fall, OctoberNovember.', "Water temperature
    is reported in degrees Celsius; DO is reported in milligrams per liter; NO3  and
    SRP are reported in micrograms per liter  \n\nDissolved oxygen ranged from 4 to
    20 mg L1  with concentrations generally increasing with distance away from the
    mouth of the river.", Oxygen concentrations were lowest during late summer in
    all 3 years  and violated state standards for fish health  following dry periods
    in the lower two thirds of the water column at sites 13 in June and August 2010
    and in bottom water at site 1 in August 2012., 'During the unusually wet year
    of 2011, DO never fell below 5 mg L1.', Hypoxic conditions in summer 2010 and
    2012 occurred in association with mixed flagellate blooms., Spatial distribution
    of summer hypoxia from 20102012 is similar to that reported by previous studies
    with concentrations increasing along the southern shore as river water becomes
    diluted with bay water., 'However, DO concentrations were 1.8 times higher at
    site 1 and 1.4 times higher at site 6 than reported by Jeffries.', Secchi depth
    ranged from 0.54.0 m and generally peaked during the fall season., 'However, when
    precipitation and river discharge were unusually high in fall 2011, the seasonal
    increase in light penetration in Raritan Bay was less pronounced.', Low Secchi
    depths reflected both sediments in runoff and algal blooms., 'For example, the
    low Secchi depths  recorded at all sites on 17 April 2010 followed the wettest
    March on record in New Jersey and another significant rain event occurring from
    April 1617.', 'In late spring and early summer 2011, low Secchi depths  coincided
    with both high river discharge and blooms of diatoms and/or flagellates.', 'Nitrate
    and soluble phosphorus concentrations  continue to indicate eutrophic conditions,
    as expected.', 'Overall, nitrate concentrations are 20 times higher at site 1
    and 50 times higher at site 6 than reported by Jeffries, and SRP concentrations
    are 20 times higher at site 1 and 10 times higher at site 6.', Spatial and temporal
    patterns for N and P concentrations in Raritan Bay are also different from that
    reported by Jeffries., 'In 1958, nitrate concentrations were highest in spring
    and decreased with distance away from the mouth of the Raritan River, and when
    river flow and nitrate loading decreased during summer, nitrate concentration
    decreased throughout the bay and station differences in nitrate concentrations
    were less pronounced.', These patterns indicated that the Raritan River was the
    major source of nitrate entering the Bay., 'In this study, nitrate concentrations
    still generally decreased with distance away from the mouth of the Raritan River
    during spring and summer.', 'However, the trend reverses itself during fall when
    average nitrate concentrations are higher in the Lower Bay.', 'In addition, nitrate
    concentrations are now highest during late summer and early fall months  rather
    than during spring as reported by Jeffries.', Spatial patterns for SRP concentrations
    in Raritan Bay are also different from patterns described by Jeffries., 'In 195758,
    SRP values were maximal at station 6, suggesting that Lower Bay water flooding
    into Raritan Bay was an important source of P to the system.', 'During this study,
    however, SRP values were significantly higher at site 2  and site 3  than at all
    the other stations.', 'Although not studied by Jeffries in 1958, ammonium and
    total iron have also been identified as important nutrients in determining overall
    algal biomass and associated adverse effects of eutrophication.', Ammonium concentrations
    in Raritan Bay ranged from ;20  to 500 g L1., Ammonium concentrations peaked during
    summer months  with highest values in the lower third of the water column., Total
    iron concentrations in Raritan Bay ranged from 40 to 630 g L1  and ferrous iron
    concentrations ranged from &lt;20  to 290 g L1., 'Dissolved silicon, which is
    particularly important for the growth and reproduction of diatoms, ranged from
    10 to 19,500 g L1.', Phytoplankton biomass as chlorophyll a ranged from 0.1 to
    43 g L1 over the 3-year study., Phytoplankton biomass generally peaked in late
    spring each year., A total of 78 phytoplankton taxa were identified in samples
    from Raritan Bay., 'These include 7 cyanobacteria, 34 diatoms, 24 dinoflagellates,
    1 raphidophyte, 3 euglenoids, 6 green algae, 1 prasinophyte, and various chrysophytes.',
  Cryptophytes and prymnesiophytes were included as well but were difficult to consistently
    distinguish beyond class level in preserved samples., 'Of the 78 phytoplankton
    taxa identified in Raritan Bay, 14 have been identified as capable of causing
    harmful algal blooms.', 'Total cell density ranged from 4  102 to 7  104 cells
    ml1, and species richness ranged from 3 to 24.', 'Overall, flagellates were the
    most dominant functional group in this system, accounting for &gt;50 % of phytoplankton
    cells, except for spring 2010 and fall 2012 when diatoms were dominant.', 'Although
    dinoflagellates comprised &gt;30 % of the taxa identified in this study, they
    never accounted for more than 8 % of phytoplankton cells.', 'Dinoflagellates were
    most abundant and diverse during spring months, and cyanobacteria were most abundant
    during summer and early fall, particularly along the southern shore.', 'Relative
    abundance  of dinoflagellates, diatoms, cyanobacteria, and other flagellates in
    Raritan Bay from spring 2010 through fall 2012


    A total of 40 zooplankton taxa were identified in plankton tows from the Raritan
    Bay.', 'Total density of zooplankton ranged from 1 to 2  103 organisms L1, and
    species richness ranged from 2 to 12 species.', Both zooplankton abundance and
    species richness was greatest in late spring and early summer., 'Relative zooplankton
    abundances varied seasonally and from year-to-year; however, rotifers, copepods,
    and copepod nauplii generally comprised the greatest proportion of the zooplankton
    taxa identified.', 'Mnemiopsis leidyi was most abundant in July  at sites 3, 4,
    and 5.', The population of M. leidyi was in decline  by September and virtually
    absent from samples in October and November., NMDS of phytoplankton species abundance
    also indicates that species composition varied seasonally., 'As evidenced by the
    clear separation of spring samples from summer and fall samples in the ordination
    diagram, spring phytoplankton assemblages in Raritan Bay have a distinct species
    composition.', 'A variety of diatoms and dinoflagellates, particularly H. rotundata
    and Heterocapsa triquetra  Stein, were abundant during spring months when precipitation,
    river discharge, and Si/N ratios were high.', 'The copepods, Acartia tonsa Dana,
    Oithona spp., and Eurytemora affinis Poppe, were also more abundant during spring
    in Raritan Bay.', 'Lower river discharge rates and higher temperature, salinity,
    nitrate, and SRP concentrations were associated with increased abundance of flagellates,
    including green flagellates, cryptomonads, some dinoflagellates  Schiller, Pfiesteria-like
    dinoflagellates), and raphidophytes.', Secchi depth was greatest in fall when
    river discharge and phytoplankton cell number and biomass were lower., 'Ordination

    NMDS of phytoplankton species abundance also indicated that species composition
    varied from year-to-year, and these year-to-year differences were even more pronounced
    when separate ordinations were run with samples from a single season.', 'As mentioned,
    flagellates, particularly chlamydomonad-like species and cryptomonads, were always
    abundant in Raritan Bay, but year-to-year variations in river flow were often
    highly correlated with shifts in phytoplankton composition.', 'When winter and
    spring river discharge rates, oxygen concentrations, and N/P ratios were higher
    in 2010 and 2011, diatoms and Heterocapsa spp.', reached greater densities in
    Raritan Bay during April and May., 'During 2010 and 2011, higher spring river
    discharge rates lead to lower salinity and water temperature and higher N/P ratio
    during summer and fall  and a summer/fall phytoplankton assemblage composed of

    In contrast, lower winter and spring river discharge rates lead to higher salinity
    and SRP concentration and lower N/P ratio in Raritan Bay.', These spring conditions
    were associated with relatively high biomass  and diversity  of zooplankton as
    well as a greater number of polychaete larvae., 'In addition, 2012 was characterized
    by increased abundance of flagellates, especially the raphidophyte H. akashiwo,
    which reached its maximum density in July 2012.', 'During summer 2012, total zooplankton
    abundance was significantly lower  than total abundance during summer of 2010  and
    summer of 2011.', 'When large amounts of precipitation fell in fall 2012, high
    river discharge rates and higher Si/N ratios in the bay  were associated with
    declining H. akashiwo cell numbers and increasing numbers of the diatoms, Chaetoceros
    decipiens P.T.', 'Cleve, Coscinodiscus spp., Cylindrotheca closterium  Reiman,
    and Rhizosolenia spp..', 'In fact, diatoms comprised more than 50 % of the phytoplankton
    cells in October 2012.', The zooplankton assemblage in fall 2012 was composed
    almost entirely of copepod nauplii and adults., 'The Raritan Bay is both ecologically
    and economically significant, supporting numerous recreational and commercial
    fisheries and providing habitat for waterfowl, shellfish, and marine, estuarine,
    and anadromous fish.', 'However, the water quality and ecological integrity of
    this system has long been threatened by a dense human population and urban and
    industrial overdevelopment, and full utilization of these waters for commercial
    fishing and recreational activities is restricted by poor water quality.', 'Our
    multiyear study of Raritan Bay indicates that this system continues to exhibit
    numerous symptoms of eutrophication, including high algal biomass, high turbidity,
    seasonal hypoxia and violations of the dissolved oxygen standard to protect the
    health of bottom-dwelling fishes, and blooms of potentially harmful phytoplankton
    species.', The continued nutrient enrichment of this system likely reflects the
    numerous municipal discharges to the bay and the sensitivity of water quality
    variables to alterations in land use., 'A number of studies in the Raritan Bay
    and Hudson River estuary have demonstrated some improvements to water quality
    in this system such as increases in DO and decreases in fecal coliforms, biological
    oxygen demand, and total suspended solids  following passage of the Clean Water
    Act in 1972 and improvements to sewage treatment.', 'However, efforts to decrease
    nutrient loading by constructing and upgrading sewage treatment plants throughout
    the RRB are likely being offset by human population growth  and a history of high-nutrient
    loading.', 'In addition, urban land cover and municipal discharges are concentrated
    in the lower Raritan River Basin in Middlesex County around the mouth of the Raritan
    River, and sewer overflows and the discharge of raw sewage and street debris following
    storms continues to be a major pollution problem in this system.', Human activity
    has profoundly changed the landscape in the RRB over the past few decades., 'The
    construction of shore management structures, highways, and landfills and the discharge
    of industrial waste and oil have all contributed to the growing pollution in the
    bay.', 'The RRB is now 36 % urban, and most of the housing development and conversion
    to urban land use occurred between 1986 and 1995.', The construction of housing
    and roads along with runoff from the suburban landscape and storm drains are thought
    to be major sources of nonpoint nutrients and pollutants to Raritan Bay., 'Much
    like other coastal river basins, N and P loads to the Raritan River are contributed
    primarily by nonpermitted sources, such as urban land cover and septic tanks,
    particularly during median and high-flow periods.', 'Yet, relatively little attention
    has been given to controlling nonpoint sources of pollutants.', Water quality
    monitoring studies in other systems have also demonstrated that targeted goals
    to reduce nutrient loading are not realized because the importance of controlling
    nonpoint loading has been overlooked., 'Considering the magnitude of the nutrient
    loads to this system, the increase in nutrient concentrations in Raritan Bay over
    the last 50 years is not all that surprising.', 'However, ambient nutrient concentrations
    and ratios are key variables supporting phytoplankton assemblage shifts and the
    formation of HABs.', 'Analysis of the detailed, 3-year dataset from this study
    indicates that climatic conditions and nutrient concentrations and ratios interacted
    to influence the origin and succession and composition of phytoplankton blooms
    in Raritan Bay.', The abundance of flagellates in Raritan Bay follows the general
    trend observed in other eutrophic systems where increased nutrient enrichment
    promotes overall shifts in dominance from diatoms to flagellates., Seasonal changes
    in the composition of both phytoplankton and zooplankton were mostly consistent
    with descriptions from previous studies of Raritan Bay and other coastal systems
    of New Jersey., 'As in other systems, hydrologic forcing  is an important factor
    influencing water quality and seasonal shifts in plankton composition in Raritan
    Bay.', 'Increases in river discharge and Si/N ratios in spring were associated
    with increases in faster-growing diatom taxa, which take up dissolved silica and
    use it to construct their cell walls.', 'As phytoplankton assemblages became dominated
    by diatoms during spring months, the relative abundance of copepods also increased,
    particularly during the first 2 years of the study.', Many nearshore calanoid
    copepods  produce resting eggs that sink to the bottom and remain viable until
    increasing temperatures induce hatching and initiate the next generation., The
    increase in copepods that generally occurs several weeks after the spring diatom
    bloom is considered a classic characteristic of coastal food webs., The late spring
    and early summer maxima in total zooplankton density recorded in this study was
    also reported for Raritan Bay by Jeffries  and by Sage and Herman., 'Spring plankton
    assemblages generally give way to summer/fall assemblages with a greater relative
    abundance of small flagellates, cyanobacteria, and microzooplankton such as copepod
    nauplii, rotifers, and ciliates.', 'Because they can regulate their vertical position
    in the water column and have a lower demand for silica, flagellates and cyanobacteria
    gain the competitive advantage over diatoms during summer when decreasing freshwater
    discharge rates result in water column stratification and N and P concentrations
    increase relative to Si.', 'Certain dinoflagellates such as Pfiesteria-like species
    were also more abundant during summer in association with higher salinity, nitrate,
    and SRP concentrations.', Studies in other systems have also documented increases
    in Pfiesteria-like dinoflagellates in association with high salinities and P concentrations
    during summer., These field observations about potentially toxic Pfiesteria spp.,
  are supported by laboratory experiments that have shown that increased cell production
    of P. piscicida and/or P. shumwayae has occurred under phosphate or N enrichment.,
  'The greater relative abundance of microzooplankton, particularly copepod nauplii,
    during summer also corresponds with previous studies of zooplankton annual cycles
    in the New York Bight.', This study also documented a number of phytoplankton
    blooms and the presence of several potentially harmful species., Recurring algal
    blooms associated with hypoxia and other negative ecological impacts have been
    documented in New Jersey coastal waters for the past three decades., 'Past phytoplankton
    surveys have indicated that the most common bloom formers in this area are the
    dinoflagellates, Ceratium tripos, Prorocentrum spp., and Heterocapsa spp.', and
    the raphidophycean species H. akashiwo., This study indicated that these species
    are still present and seasonally abundant in Raritan Bay., 'NMDS of phytoplankton
    species abundance indicated that the majority of these bloom-forming species are
    most abundant during summer months, except for Heterocapsa spp., which were most
    abundant during early spring over the last 3 years.', The growth rate of Heterocapsa
    seems to be constrained by low water temperatures to a lesser degree than other
    phytoplankton species., The 14 potentially harmful species identified in Raritan
    Bay as part of this study were mostly present at low densities., 'For example,
    subbloom concentrations of the potentially toxic diatom Pseudo-nitzschia spp.',
  were found at site 6 near Sandy Hook  in October 2012., 'The NJDEPs Bureau of Marine
    Monitoring screens for Pseudo-nitzschia spp., along with several other potentially
    toxic species, to ensure that shellfish harvested in NJ waters are not toxic for
    consumption.', 'Prior to 2000, the NJDEP reported that Pseudo-nitzschia spp.',
  'was abundant in NJ coastal waters during fall and winter months, but over the past
    15 years, Pseudo-nitzschia spp.', has only been reported by the NJDEP near Sandy
    Hook  one other time and at a concentration insufficient to pose a threat to human
    health., Although Pseudo-nitzschia spp., 'were present in samples too rarely during
    this study to identify patterns in their abundance to environmental gradients,
    continued monitoring for Pseudo-nitzschia spp.', 'throughout the year and the
    use of additional identification techniques to distinguish between toxic and nontoxic
    representatives of this genus are recommended, especially considering that there
    has been an increase in their abundance in other coastal systems in association
    with increased nutrient loading.', The largest monospecific blooms that occurred
    during this study were caused by H. akashiwo., This species reached high densities
    throughout Raritan Bay beginning in June 2012 with densities exceeding 3  104
    cells ml1 at site 1  and becoming less dense with distance away from the mouth
    of the Raritan River., 'H. akashiwo persisted at high densities in Raritan Bay,
    particularly at site 1, for the remainder of the 2012 sampling year and was among
    the most dominant species in spring, summer, and fall 2012.', 'This species, formerly
    called O. luteus, has been considered a dominant species, often forming late spring/early
    summer blooms in association with anthropogenic nutrient enrichment, in New Jersey
    coastal waters since the 1960s.', 'Summer blooms of H. akashiwo and the dinoflagellates,
    Prorocentrum spp.', 'and Heterocapsa rotundata, have long been associated with
    hypoxia and fish kills in the HudsonRaritan estuary.', 'As mentioned, oxygen concentrations
    in bottom water at site 1  violated New Jersey standards for fish health in August
    2012 as the H. akashiwo bloom was beginning to decompose.', 'NMDS analyses indicated
    that H. akashiwo abundance was associated with warmer temperatures, decreased
    river discharge, higher salinity, higher nitrate and SRP concentrations, and reduced
    total zooplankton abundance.', Year-to-year variations in H. akashiwo abundance
    in Raritan Bay suggest that both winter/spring river discharge rates and water
    temperature are interacting to determine the density of this species., 'Previous
    studies have shown that cysts, both vegetative cells suspended in the water column
    and benthic cysts, play an important role in the survival and abundance of H.
    akashiwo during summer seasons.', 'Germination of H. akashiwo cysts is optimal
    at 15 C, and population growth is greatest when surface water temperatures reach
    18 C. During 2010 and 2011, average water temperatures in the bay did not reach
    15 C until May.', 'By this time, high winter/spring precipitation and river discharge
    rates created conditions more favorable to diatoms and lowered the competitive
    ability of H. akashiwo.', High river discharge may also play a role in flushing
    vegetative cysts out of the system in spring., 'In 2012, however, the combination
    of lowered winter/spring river discharge and earlier onset of optimal germination
    temperature  increased the rate of H. akashiwo excystment and population growth.',
  'After this initial growth period, the allelopathic activity of H. akashiwo against
    competing phytoplankton and ability to migrate within the water column to obtain
    nutrients likely played a role in maintaining the bloom.', The inverse relationship
    between H. akashiwo and total zooplankton abundance indicated by NMDS may suggest
    that the H. akashiwo bloom that formed in late spring 2012 throughout Raritan
    Bay produced adverse effects for some zooplankters., A number of laboratory studies
    aimed at quantifying deleterious effects of H. akashiwo on zooplankton grazers
    have been conducted., 'These studies have generally shown that H. akashiwo is
    either avoided as a food item when part of a mixed prey assemblage, or if ingested,
    decreases growth rate and increases the mortality rate of a number of protist
    grazers.', 'Interestingly, Verity and Stoecker  reported that H. akashiwo was
    lethal to tintinnids at concentrations above 5  103 cells ml1 in multi-algal treatments.',
  'In this study, H. akashiwo densities approached 5  104 cells ml1 in July 2012 at
    the same time that tintinnids were the most abundant group of zooplankton in the
    bay.', 'However, by August, no tintinnids were found in samples, and copepod nauplii
    dominated.', It is possible that the seemingly delayed effect of H. akashiwo on
    tintinnids was due to tintinnid selective feeding on nontoxic prey., Graham and
    Strom  suggested that preferential feeding on alternate prey can reduce toxic
    effects of H. akashiwo on microzooplankton., Selective zooplankton grazing in
    favor of potential phytoplankton competitor species may have contributed to the
    persistence of the H. akashiwo bloom and is worth further investigation., 'At
    the end of this 3-year study, fall storms lead to increased river discharge rates
    and the decline of the H. akashiwo bloom throughout the bay.', 'Diatoms regained
    dominance, and relative abundance of adult copepods increased once again.', 'Similar
    to Jeffries  assessment of Raritan Bay water quality more than 50 year ago, the
    detailed 3-year dataset from this study indicates that this system is still rich
    in plant nutrients arising from natural and domestic sources and capable of supporting
    extremely dense plankton populations.', 'However, this study suggests that there
    have been some changes in water quality since 1958.', 'As mentioned, water column
    DO concentrations throughout Raritan Bay appear to be higher now than they were
    50 years ago.', Salinity also appears to be higher throughout the bay during spring
    months., Increased salinization in spring when precipitation and river discharge
    are high could be related to increases in impervious surface coverage in the RRB
    and the use of deicer salt on roadways., 'In addition, N and P concentrations
    have increased in Raritan Bay, and spatial and temporal patterns for these nutrients
    are different from that reported by Jeffries.', 'For example, current trends indicate
    that, although the Raritan River is still an important source of N during spring
    and episodic increases in river discharge in association with storms and hurricanes,
    recycled sources of N become important during late summer and fall when river
    discharge is lower.', Other studies have indicated that N regeneration from the
    sediments during seasonal periods of oxygen depletion in the lower water column
    can play an important role in nutrient loading in eutrophic systems., 'Nitrate
    concentrations also appear to have increased to a greater extent in the Lower
    Bay near site 6, particularly during low-flow periods.', 'The Lower Bay receives
    riverine flow from the Hudson River, which has one of the highest N inputs per
    area of estuary in the USA.', 'In contrast to nitrate, SRP concentrations appear
    to have increased to a greater extent at the head of Raritan Bay  when compared
    with Jeffries findings.', 'A suspected major source of soluble P to the Bay, especially
    during periods of low flow, is the Middlesex County wastewater treatment plant,
    which is the second-largest WWTP in the state of New Jersey  and has its outfall
    located at site 2.', 'During this study, SRP values were significantly higher
    at sites 2 and 3 than at all the other stations.', 'In order to understand the
    full magnitude of human influence on the functioning and stability of coastal
    ecosystems, it is important to intensify study of the coastal eutrophication problem
    and to generate ecological data in multiple systems.', 'The 3-year dataset from
    this study contributes new information about how climatic factors and nutrients
    may be affecting the abundance and distribution of phytoplankton taxa, including
    some potentially toxic and bloom-forming species as well as how phytoplankton
    are related to associated food webs.', The ordination results of this investigation
    have also identified several important questions for future research directions.,
  'First, blooms of H. akashiwo were associated with increases in both nitrate and
    SRP in Raritan Bay but not with iron concentrations as indicated in other systems.',
  'However, it is still unclear how altered nutrient supply ratios are affecting phytoplankton
    composition in Raritan Bay.', 'As a result, it will be important to supplement
    field observations with controlled experiments to investigate the relationship
    between specific forms and supplies of nutrients and bloom formation.', Another
    question regards the importance of selective zooplankton grazing in contributing
    to the persistence of algal blooms  in Raritan Bay., 'How might manipulations
    of zooplankton abundance affect phytoplankton biomass and species composition?',
  One final question concerns the impact of high cell densities of potentially toxic
    phytoplankton species such as H. akashiwo on the health of reintroduced eastern
    oysters., 'Although C. virginica is ecologically extinct in Raritan Bay, the New
    York/New Jersey Baykeeper has been conducting studies to determine whether existing
    conditions in Raritan Bay can support long-term oyster survival.', Research in
    other systems has indicated that even short-term exposures of oysters to H. akashiwo
    blooms could have long-term physiological effects., 'Since this study has indicated
    that H. akashiwo can form large monospecific blooms in this system, more research
    on the lethal and sublethal effects of HABs on C. virginica is needed in order
    to develop a productive long-term strategy for reestablishing this species into
    Raritan Bay.', Long-term monitoring  of coastal ecosystem processes  and community
    characteristics  are vital for improving our understanding of the mechanisms involved
    in the development of eutrophication., 'As a result, we intend to continue collection
    of data on water quality and plankton assemblages.', 'With further long-term observations,
    greater confidence in the processes that lead to altered phytoplankton composition
    and food web structure will be realized.', 'This information will strengthen the
    ability of scientists, public health officials, and resource managers to predict
    the likelihood of phytoplankton blooms and bring us closer to the design of appropriate
    management strategies to mitigate the impact of cultural eutrophication on coastal
    ecosystems.', 'We thank Captain Mick Trzaska, captain and owner of the CRT II,
