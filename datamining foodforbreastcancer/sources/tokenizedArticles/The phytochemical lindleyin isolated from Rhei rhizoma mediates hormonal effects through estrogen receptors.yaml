text: ['Some plant compounds or herb mixtures are popular alternatives to conventional
    therapies and contain organic compounds that bind to some nuclear receptors, such
    as the estrogen receptor, to exert various biological effects.', We studied the
    effect of various herbal extracts on ERalpha and ERbeta isoforms., 'One herbal
    extract, Rhei rhizoma, acts as an agonist to both ERalpha and ERbeta.', 'The phytochemical
    lindleyin, a major component of rhubarb, might contribute to this estrogenic activity
    through ERalpha and ERbeta.', '4-Hydroxytamoxifen, an ER antagonist, completely
    reversed the estrogenic activity of lindleyin.', 'Lindleyin binds to ERalpha in
    vitro, as demonstrated using a fluorescent polarization assay.', 'The in vivo
    effect of rhubarb extract was studied using a vitellogenin assay system in the
    freshwater fish, Japanese medaka.', There were marked increases in serum vitellogenin
    levels in male medaka exposed to rhubarb extract., 'We conclude that lindleyin,
    a component of some herbal medicines, is a novel phytoestrogen and might trigger
    many of the biological responses evoked by the physiological estrogens.']
