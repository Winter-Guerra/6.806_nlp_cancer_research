text: [The purpose of this study was to determine whether a dry bean  containing diet
    exerts an inhibitory effect on mammary carcinogenesis in a well-characterized
    rodent model for breast cancer., 'Twenty-one-d-old female Sprague Dawley rats
    were given an intraperitoneal injection of 1-methyl-1-nitrosourea and 7 d after
    carcinogen injection were randomized to 1 of 5 groups fed a modification of the
    AIN-93G diet formulation containing 0, 7.5, 15, 30, or 60%  small red dry bean
    incorporated as cooked, freeze-dried, and milled powder.', All experimental diets
    had the same macronutrient content based on proximate analysis., 'Compared with
    the control group, dry bean consumption resulted in dose-dependent reductions
    in mammary cancer incidence, cancer multiplicity, and tumor burden.', 'Dry bean
    consumption was associated with dose-dependent reductions in plasma concentrations
    of glucose, insulin, insulin-like growth factor-1, C-reactive protein, and interleukin-6
    in food-deprived rats.', Analysis of mammary adenocarcinomas indicated that a
    dominant mechanism accounting for reduced tumor burden was the induction of apoptosis.,
  'B cell lymphoma 2 and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein levels decreased
    and BCL-2associated X protein increased with increasing dry bean consumption,
    findings consistent with the induction of apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway.',
  These data demonstrate that a legume without noteworthy content of isoflavones inhibits
    the development of mammary carcinogenesis and are consistent with a recent report
    from the Nurses Health Study that bean or lentil intake is associated with a lower
    risk for breast cancer.]
