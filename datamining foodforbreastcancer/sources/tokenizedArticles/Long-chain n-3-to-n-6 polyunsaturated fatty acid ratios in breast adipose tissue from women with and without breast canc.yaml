text: ['Animal studies suggest that dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids  of the n-6
    class, found in corn and safflower oils, may be precursors of intermediates involved
    in the development of mammary tumors, whereas long-chain  n-3 PUFAs, found in
    fish oil, can inhibit these effects.', This case-control study was designed to
    examine the relationship between the PUFA composition of breast adipose tissue
    and the risk of breast cancer., 'Using fatty acid levels in breast adipose tissue
    as a biomarker of past qualitative dietary intake of fatty acids, we examined
    the hypothesis that breast cancer risk is negatively associated with specific
    LC n-3 PUFAs  and positively associated with n-6 PUFAs.', Breast adipose tissue
    was collected from 73 breast cancer patients and 74 controls with macromastia.,
  The fatty acid levels were determined by gas-liquid chromatography., A logistic
    regression model was used to obtain odds ratio estimates while adjusting for age.,
  The age-adjusted n-6 PUFA  content was significantly higher in cases than in controls.,
  'There was a trend in the age-adjusted data suggesting that, at a given level of
    n-6 PUFA, LC n-3 PUFAs  may have a protective effect.', A similar inverse relationship
    was observed with LC n-3-to-n-6 ratio when the data were adjusted for age., 'We
    conclude that total n-6 PUFAs may be contributing to the high risk of breast cancer
    in the United States and that LC n-3 PUFAs, derived from fish oils, may have a
    protective effect.']
