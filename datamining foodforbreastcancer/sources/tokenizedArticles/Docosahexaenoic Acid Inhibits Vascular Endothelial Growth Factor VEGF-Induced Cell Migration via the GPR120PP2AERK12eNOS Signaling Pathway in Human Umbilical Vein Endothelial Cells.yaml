text: [Cell migration plays an important role in angiogenesis and wound repair., 'Vascular
    endothelial growth factor  is an endothelial cell-specific mitogen that is essential
    for endothelial cell survival, proliferation, and migration.', 'Docosahexaenoic
    acid, an n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid, shows both anti-inflammatory and antioxidant
    activities in vitro and in vivo.', This study investigated the molecular mechanism
    by which DHA down-regulates VEGF-induced cell migration., 'HUVECs were used as
    the study model, and the MTT assay, Western blot, wound-healing assay, and phosphatase
    activity assay were used to explore the effects of DHA on cell migration.', GPR120
    is the putative receptor for DHA action., 'The results showed that DHA, PD98059,
    and GW9508  inhibited VEGF-induced cell migration.', 'In contrast, pretreatment
    with okadaic acid  and S-nitroso-N-acetyl-dl-penicillamine  reversed the inhibition
    of cell migration by DHA.', VEGF-induced cell migration was accompanied by phosphorylation
    of ERK1/2 and eNOS., Treatment of HUVECs with DHA increased PP2A enzyme activity
    and decreased VEGF-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and eNOS., 'However, pretreatment
    with OA significantly decreased DHA-induced PP2A enzyme activity and reversed
    the DHA inhibition of VEGF-induced ERK1/2 and eNOS phosphorylation.', These results
    suggest that stimulation of PP2A activity and inhibition of the VEGF-induced ERK1/2/eNOS
    signaling pathway may be involved in the DHA suppression of VEGF-induced cell
    migration., 'Thus, the effect of DHA on angiogenesis and wound repair is at least
    partly by virtue of its attenuation of cell migration.', "cell migration; docosahexaenoic
    acid ; human umbilical vein endothelial cells ; nitric oxide ; vascular endothelial
    growth factor \n\nDocosahexaenoic acid  is enriched in fatty fish and fish oil
    supplements and is well-known for its anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and
    anticancer properties.", Cancer is among the leading causes of death in both economically
    developed countries and developing countries., Epidemiological studies show that
    a diet rich in n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids  is correlated with reduced risk
    of angiogenic diseases such as cancers., DHA has been shown to inhibit vascular
    sprout formation in retinal microvascular endothelial cells., 'However, the mechanism
    underlying the inhibition of cell migration by DHA, which is critical for angiogenesis
    and wound repair, is not fully understood.', G protein-coupled receptors  are
    important signaling molecules involved in many cellular functions., 'Specific
    ligand binding to GPRs stimulates and induces a variety of cellular responses
    via several second messenger pathways, for example, regulation of cAMP generation,
    the phospholipase C pathway, ion channels, and mitogen-activated protein kinases.',
  'In a previous study, Oh et al.', found that DHA exerted potent anti-inflammatory
    effects through GPR120., 'Angiogenesis, the process of the formation of new blood
    vessels by sprouting of the preexisting microvascular network, is involved in
    numerous physiological processes including embryogenesis, tissue remodeling, wound
    healing, and disease development such as diabetic retinopathy, rheumatoid arthritis,
    tumor growth, and growth of atherosclerotic plaques.', 'Angiogenesis is controlled
    by vascular endothelial growth factor, a pro-angiogenic factor.', 'VEGF-induced
    signal transduction involves binding to tyrosine kinase receptors, which leads
    to endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and new vessel formation.', 'VEGF
    was reported to induce a wide variety of signaling pathways, including protein
    kinase C, phospholipase C-, extracellular signal-regulated kinase, p38 MAPK, phospholipase
    C, and phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase /Akt.', 'Hence, it is critical to understand
    the VEGF-activated signaling pathways that play an important role in VEGF-mediated
    cell processes.', 'Nitric oxide, which is synthesized from the amino acid l-arginine
    by the NOS family of enzymes, is a gaseous molecule with a wide range of physiological
    and pathophysiological activities, including the regulation of angiogenesis.',
  'The NOS family is composed of three members: neuronal NOS, endothelial NOS, and
    inducible NOS.', 'eNOS is constitutively expressed in endothelial cells, but various
    physical and chemical stimuli affect eNOS levels in vivo and in vitro.', 'Moreover,
    eNOS is activated upon exposure to fluid shear stress and numerous agonists via
    cellular events such as protein phosphorylation.', 'Protein phosphatase 2A  is
    a heterotrimeric complex composed of three subunits including a structural subunit,
    a regulatory subunit, and a catalytic subunit.', PP2A is a crucial intracellular
    serine/threonine phosphatase., 'In addition, PP2A plays a significant role in
    the regulation of specific signal transduction cascades including ERK1/2, JNK,
    and p38 MAPK.', 'In recent years, PP2A was shown to have tumor suppressor activity
    in myeloid CML-BC patient-derived mononuclear marrow cells.', 'Thus, enhancement
    of PP2A tumor suppressor activity may represent a potential therapeutic strategy
    for malignancy.', The antitumor effect of DHA has been studied in MCF-7 human
    breast cancer cells by induction of heme oxygenase 1 and inhibition of TPA-induced
    matrix metalloproteinase 9  expression., 'Moreover, DHA was reported to have a
    potent anti-angiogenic effect.', The pro-angiogenic effect of VEGF and NO has
    also been demonstrated., 'In this study, therefore, we investigated whether DHA
    has an opposing effect on cell migration that is associated with angiogenesis
    and wound repair and the possible mechanisms involved.', 'Medium 199, Dulbeccos

    and antibodies against ERK1/2, phospho-ERK1/2, eNOS, and phospho-eNOS were from
    Cell Signaling Technology.', 'The human umbilical vein endothelial cell line  was
    obtained from Clonetics  and was cultured on gelatin-coated cell culture dishes
    in M199 supplemented with 2.2 g/L sodium bicarbonate, 0.1 g/L heparin, 37.5 mg/L
    ECGS, 20% FBS, 100,000 units/L penicillin, 0.25 mg/mL amphotericin, and 100 mg/L
    streptomycin at 37 C in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator.', Cell viability was assessed
    by the MTT assay., 'The MTT assay measures the ability of viable cells to reduce
    a yellow 3--2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide to a purple formazan by mitochondrial
    succinate dehydrogenase.', HUVECs were grown to 8090% confluence and then treated
    with various concentrations of DHA  and GW9508  with or without VEGF  for 8 h
    in M199 containing 2% FBS., 'Finally, the medium was removed, and the cells were
    washed with phosphate-buffered saline.', 'The cells were then incubated with MTT  in
    M199 medium at 37 C for an additional 3 h. The medium was removed, and 2-propanol
    was added to dissolve the formazan.', 'After centrifugation at 10000g for 5 min,
    the supernatant of each sample was transferred to 96-well plates, and absorbance
    was read at 595 nm in an ELISA reader.', The absorbance in the control group was
    regarded as 100% cell viability., 'After each experiment, cells were washed twice
    with PBS and were harvested with 150 L of lysis buffer.', Cell homogenates were
    centrifuged at 14000g for 20 min at 4 C. The resulting supernatant was used as
    a cellular protein for Western blotting analysis., The total protein was analyzed
    by use of the Coomassie Plus protein assay reagent kit., 'Equal amounts of cellular
    proteins were electrophoresed in a sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel,
    and proteins were then transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes.', 'Nonspecific
    binding sites on the membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in 15 mM Tris/150
    mM NaCl buffer  at room temperature for 2 h. Membranes were probed with anti-ERK1/2,
    antiphospho-ERK1/2, anti-eNOS, antiphospho-eNOS, and anti--actin.', The membranes
    were then probed with the secondary antibody labeled with horseradish peroxidase.,
  The bands were visualized by using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit  and were scanned
    by use of a luminescence image analyzer., The bands were quantitated with ImageGauge
    software., An in vitro wound-healing assay was used to measure directional endothelial
    cell migration., HUVECs were seeded onto gelatin-coated 6-well plates and allowed
    to form a confluent monolayer., 'Monolayers were wounded by using a sterile 200
    L pipet tip, washed with PBS to remove floating cells, and photographed.', Cells
    were then cultured in M199 medium containing 2% FBS and 50 ng/mL VEGF., 'Meanwhile,
    the cells were treated with various concentrations of DHA  with or without SNAP  or
    OA  for 8 h. In addition, the cells were treated with GW9508  for 8 h. Cells were
    then photographed  to monitor cell migration into the wounded area, and the width
    of the cell-free zone  was calculated.', PP2A activity was determined by use of
    a Ser/Thr phosphatase assay kit according to the instructions of the manufacturer.,
  'After treatment, cells were scraped with lysis buffer  and protease inhibitors,
    sonicated for 10 s, and centrifuged at 2000g for 5 min.', 'Thereafter, phosphopeptide  was
    added to the cell lysate, followed by incubation at room temperature for 15 min,
    and then Malachite Green phosphate was added and the reaction was allowed to proceed
    at room temperature for another 15 min for color development.', The relative absorbance
    was measured at 650 nm in a microplate reader., Data were analyzed by using analysis
    of variance., The significance of the difference between mean values was determined
    by one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukeys test., p values ;0.05 were
    taken to be statistically significant., 'As measured by the MTT assay, the cell
    viabilities of HUVECs treated with VEGF alone; 50, 100, or 200 M DHA; or VEGF
    and 50, 100, or 200 M DHA were 110.5  6.6, 92.9  1.2, 92.4  2.7, 12.1  2.5, 103.6  7.4,
    98.5  7.8, and 11.8  0.8%, respectively, compared with the unstimulated controls.',
  'Thus, there were no adverse effects on the growth of cells up to a concentration
    of 100 M DHA in the presence or absence of 50 ng/mL VEGF, which was used to induce
    cell migration.', 'The highest concentration of DHA used in the present study
    was 100 M.


    The cell viabilities of HUVECs treated with VEGF alone, 1 or 10 M GW9508, or VEGF
    and 1 or 10 M GW9508 were 116.3  5.8, 97.6  3.5, 99.1  2.5, 107.6  4.5, and 107.0  7.3%,
    respectively, compared with the unstimulated controls.', 'Thus, there were no
    adverse effects on the growth of cells up to a concentration of 10 M GW9508 in
    the presence or absence of 50 ng/mL VEGF.', Endothelial cell migration is necessary
    to angiogenesis and wound repair., 'In addition to activation by chemotactic,
    hepatotactic, and mechanotactic stimuli, angiogenesis involves degradation of
    the extracellular matrix by matrix metalloproteinases  to enable progression of
    the migrating cells.', 'Moreover, at least 10 MMPs are up-regulated during wound
    healing by epidermal, dermal, fibroblast, and blood cells in mammals.', 'To determine
    the effect of DHA on endothelial cell migration in vitro, confluent monolayers
    of HUVECs were scratched and cultured with M199 medium containing 2% FBS plus
    50 ng/mL VEGF alone or in addition to 100 M DHA.', 'As shown in Figure 1, VEGF
    significantly induced cell migration, whereas coculture with DHA inhibited the
    VEGF-induced cell migration.', Figure 1., DHA inhibits VEGF-induced migration
    of HUVECs., 'Cells were scratched and then stimulated with 50 ng/mL VEGF in the
    presence or absence of 100 M DHA for 8 h. Migration was observed by using a phase-contrast
    microscope, at 100 magnification.', 'Values are the mean  SD, n = 3.', Values
    not sharing the same letter are significantly different., VEGF has been shown
    to induce a wide variety of signaling pathways that transduce the physiological
    or pathophysiological activities of VEGF., ERK1/2 is one such pathway., It has
    been shown that there is a relationship between ERK1/2 phosphorylation and eNOS
    activation in rat sinusoidal endothelial cells., 'Thus, we determined the effect
    of VEGF on both ERK1/2 and eNOS phosphorylation.', 'As shown in Figure 2A, VEGF
    stimulated the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and eNOS, and this activation was abolished
    by the ERK1/2 inhibitor PD98059.', 'However, VEGF showed no effect on Akt phosphorylation.',
  'VEGF stimulated cell migration, and this effect was dependent on ERK1/2.', These
    results suggested that VEGF stimulation of cell migration is mediated by the ERK1/2/eNOS
    pathway., Figure 2., Phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and eNOS is involved in VEGF-induced
    migration of HUVECs., Cells were starved in M199 containing 2% FBS for 7 h and
    then pretreated with 20 M of the ERK1/2 inhibitor PD98059 for 1 h followed by
    incubation with 50 ng/mL VEGF for another 15 min., 'Cells were scratched and were
    cotreated with 20 M PD98059 and 50 ng/mL VEGF or treated with 50 ng/mL VEGF for

    Tumor metastasis, the spreading of the primary tumor to distant organs, is recognized
    to be one of the major causes of failure in the treatment of cancer.', 'Thus,
    intervention in a key step in the metastatic process, such as angiogenesis, is
    an effective mechanism for cancer therapy.', VEGF plays a critical role in tumor
    angiogenesis and has been shown to phosphorylate eNOS on Ser1177 in glomerular
    endothelial cells., NO produced by activation of eNOS regulates angiogenesis.,
  Dephosphorylation of phosphorylated eNOS is mediated by protein phosphatase 2A.,
  'In the present study, the role of DHA in VEGF-induced cell migration was studied
    by using a wound-healing assay.', 'As shown in Figure 3A, DHA inhibited VEGF-induced
    cell migration, and this inhibition was abolished by treatment with the PP2A inhibitor,
    OA.', These results suggested that DHA inhibition of VEGF-induced cell migration
    is likely associated with activation of PP2A enzyme activity., Figure 3., Protein
    phosphatase 2A  is involved in DHA inhibition of VEGF-induced phosphorylation
    of ERK1/2 and eNOS and cell migration., HUVECs were scratched and pretreated with
    or without 10 nM of the PP2A inhibitor okadaic acid  for 1 h and were then treated
    with 100 M DHA along with 50 ng/mL VEGF or with 50 ng/mL VEGF for another 8 h.  HUVECs
    were pretreated with or without 10 nM OA for 1 h and were then treated with 100
    M DHA for another 4 h.  HUVECs were pretreated with 10 nM OA for 1 h and were
    then treated with 100 M DHA for 8 h before being challenged with 50 ng/mL VEGF
    for another 15 min., 'Values are the mean  SD, n = 3.', Values not sharing the
    same letter are significantly different., 'Recently, it was shown that PP2A has
    tumor suppressor activity in myeloid CML-BC patient-derived mononuclear marrow
    cells.', We used the Ser/Thr phosphatase assay to measure PP2A enzyme activity.,
  'As shown in Figure 3B, DHA significantly stimulated PP2A enzyme activity compared
    with that in the control group, and this activation was attenuated by treatment
    with OA.', We next examined whether OA reversed the DHA inhibition of VEGF-induced
    ERK1/2 and eNOS phosphorylation., 'As shown in Figure 3C, VEGF induced phosphorylation
    of ERK1/2 and eNOS, and pretreatment with DHA attenuated this induction.', 'Nevertheless,
    pretreatment with OA reversed the inhibition of eNOS phosphorylation by DHA.',
  'OA also reversed the attenuation of VEGF-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation by DHA,
    although this effect was not significant.', 'Effect of GPR120 Agonist on VEGF-Induced
    Phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and eNOS as well as Cell Migration


    GPR120 is a physiological receptor for long-chain fatty acids, in particular n-3
    fatty acids, such as -linolenic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, and DHA.', 'To determine
    the role of GPR120 in DHAs inhibition of cell migration, we used the GPR120 agonist
    GW9508.', 'As shown in Figure 4A, GW9508 had an effect similar to that of DHA
    on the VEGF-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and eNOS.', 'Moreover, the inhibitory
    effect of DHA on VEGF-induced cell migration was replicated by GW9508.', These
    results suggested that the effects of DHA were highly associated with binding
    to GPR120., Figure 4., Effect of GPR120 agonist on phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and
    eNOS and cell migration induced by VEGF in HUVECs., Cells were pretreated with
    100 M DHA or 10 M GW9508 for 8 h followed by incubation with 50 ng/mL VEGF for
    another 15 min., 'Cells were scratched and were cotreated with 100 M DHA or 10
    M GW9508 along with 50 ng/mL VEGF for 8 h. Values are the mean  SD, n = 3.', Values
    not sharing the same letter are significantly different., VEGF activates eNOS
    and stimulates the release of NO from HUVECs., 'Endothelium-derived NO is critical
    regulator of endothelial cell migration, survival, and angiogenesis.', 'To determine
    the effect of the NO donor SNAP on endothelial cell migration in vitro, confluent
    monolayers of HUVECs were scratched and cultured in M199 medium containing 2%
    FBS plus vehicle, 50 ng/mL VEGF, 100 M DHA and 50 ng/mL VEGF, or 100 M DHA, 20
    M SNAP, and 50 ng/mL VEGF, respectively.', 'As shown in Figure 5, SNAP reversed
    DHA inhibition of VEGF-induced cell migration.', Figure 5., SNAP reverses DHA
    inhibition of VEGF-induced migration in HUVECs., 'Cells were scratched and were
    treated with 50 ng/mL VEGF alone, cotreated with 100 M DHA and 50 ng/mL VEGF,

    the mean  SD, n = 3.', Values not sharing the same letter are significantly different.,
  Cancer has attracted considerable attention in the past decades because it is among
    the leading causes of death globally., Protection against cancer by DHA is attributed
    to the anti-angiogenic activity of DHA., 'However, the mechanisms by which DHA
    inhibits angiogenesis are still not fully clarified.', 'In this study, we explored
    the inhibition of HUVEC cell migration by DHA and the possible mechanisms involved.',
  'We demonstrated that DHA inhibits VEGF-induced HUVEC cell migration and that this
    suppression is likely associated with binding to GPR120, activation of PP2A enzyme
    activity, and inhibition of the ERK1/2/eNOS signaling pathway.', 'Several mechanisms
    have been proposed to demonstrate the inhibitory role of DHA in angiogenesis,
    including induction of apoptosis and reduction of cell proliferation.', Rose and
    Connolly proposed that the inhibition of breast cancer cell proliferation by DHA
    was related to the reduced production of series 2 eicosanoids., 'Although DHA
    may prevent the occurrence of angiogenic diseases, it has potential side effects
    on subjects receiving revascularization therapy because of its inhibition of cell
    migration.', 'In recent years, EPA and DHA have been shown to inhibit angiogenesis,
    possibly by regulating the production or activation of various pro-angiogenic
    factors such as eNOS, VEGF, cyclooxygenase 2 -derived prostanoids, and MMP-9.',
  'Moreover, EPA and DHA dose-dependently inhibit ERK1/2 phosphorylation, and this
    is likely associated with reduced PGE2 and VEGF production by EPA and DHA in HT-29
    human colorectal cells.', 'VEGF has been shown to induce eNOS phosphorylation
    and cell migration in HUVECs, and this activation is abolished by DHA.', 'Moreover,
    DHA has been demonstrated to inhibit TPA-induced MMP-9 expression and cell migration
    and invasion in MCF-7 breast cancer cells.', 'Consistent with the results of these
    previous studies, our data showed that DHA exerted an inhibitory effect on VEGF-induced
    cell migration in HUVECs.', Cell migration is essential for angiogenesis., 'Thus,
    the results of the present study suggest that DHA is a potential anti-angiogenic
    agent.', 'ERK1/2 is known to play an important role in cell proliferation, and
    protein phosphatases are generally identified as inhibitors of cell proliferation
    via dephosphorylation of ERK1/2.', Activation of the Akt/eNOS or ERK1/2/eNOS pathways
    is reported to be involved in VEGF-induced NO release., 'In the present study,
    VEGF activated phosphorylation of ERK1/2 but not of Akt.', Pretreatment with the
    ERK1/2 inhibitor PD98059 abolished VEGF-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and
    eNOS in HUVECs., These results suggest that eNOS is the downstream target of ERK1/2.,
  'Moreover, DHA was shown to inhibit VEGF-induced cell migration via suppression
    of the ERK1/2/eNOS signaling pathway.', 'Similar to DHA treatment, the ERK1/2
    inhibitor PD98059 abolished cell migration.', 'Furthermore, as shown in Figure
    5, SNAP reversed the DHA inhibition of VEGF-induced cell migration.', These results
    strongly suggest that the DHA inhibition of VEGF-induced cell migration is through
    the ERK1/2/eNOS-mediated signaling pathway., Reversible protein phosphorylation
    plays an important role in many cellular processes., 'In general, cells use protein
    phosphorylation to alter enzyme properties such as activity and cell distribution
    of key regulatory proteins involved in specific pathways.', 'Through the use of
    specific PP2A inhibitors and gene silencing technique, PP2A has been shown to
    play a key role in the regulation of cell cycle, cell morphology, and development.',
  'In addition, PP2A was demonstrated to be a tumor suppressor and can be a target
    for cancer therapy.', 'For example, it is reported that conjugated linoleic acid
    inhibits the proliferation of MCF-7 human breast cancer cells and that the working
    mechanisms include activation of PP2A and inhibition of ERK1/2 activation.', Pretreatment
    with the PP2A inhibitor OA reverses the effect of conjugated linoleic acid on
    both increased PP2A expression level and dephosphorylation of ERK1/2., This result
    strongly suggests that dephosphorylation of ERK1/2 is mediated by PP2A., Phosphorylated
    eNOS is also a substrate of PP2A., 'It is reported that endostatin inhibits endothelial
    cell migration and angiogenesis by down-regulating the phosphorylation of eNOS
    at Ser1177 via PP2A, which results in a decrease in NO synthesis.', 'In the present
    study, we demonstrated that DHA activated PP2A enzyme activity, which was inhibited
    by OA pretreatment.', Pretreatment with OA reversed the inhibitory effect of DHA
    on VEGF-induced cell migration and phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and eNOS., These
    results indicate that PP2A participates in the DHA inhibition of VEGF-induced
    ERK1/2/eNOS phosphorylation and cell migration., Activation of PP2A by DHA is
    by an as yet unidentified signaling pathway., 'DHA exerts anti-inflammatory effects,
    but the mechanisms of these effects are not fully understood.', It has been shown
    that GPR120 functions as an n-3 PUFA receptor., 'In an in vitro study using RAW
    264.7 cells and primary intraperitoneal macrophages, stimulation of GPR120 with
    n-3 PUFAs or the chemical agonist GW9508 causes a wide range of anti-inflammatory
    effects.', All of these effects are abolished by GPR120 knockdown., 'Therefore,
    we hypothesize that DHA inhibits VEGF-induced cell migration through binding with
    GPR120.', We used the GPR120 agonist GW9508 to simulate the activation of GPR120
    by DHA in the suppression of VEGF-induced cell migration., 'The results showed
    that GW9508 significantly inhibited VEGF-induced cell migration, and the inhibitory
    effect was similar to that of DHA.', 'In addition, GW9508 significantly suppressed
    VEGF-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and eNOS, which is critical to cell migration.',
  Our findings in the present study are presented schematically in Figure 6., 'In
    conclusion, DHA significantly inhibits VEGF-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2
    and eNOS and cell migration via binding to GPR120 and induction of PP2A enzyme
    activity in HUVECs.', Treatment with the NO donor SNAP reverses the DHA inhibition
    of VEGF-induced cell migration., 'Taken together, these results support an opposing
    role of DHA in cell migration, which is implicated in its anticancer and anti-wound-repair
    properties.', Figure 6., Model showing the pathways that mediate DHA inhibition
