text: [Little is known about the effects of diet after breast cancer diagnosis on
    survival., We prospectively examined the relation between post-diagnosis dietary
    factors and breast cancer and all-cause survival in women with a history of invasive
    breast cancer diagnosed between 1987 and 1999., Diet after breast cancer diagnosis
    was measured using a 126-item food frequency questionnaire., 'Among 4,441 women
    without a history of breast cancer recurrence prior to completing the questionnaire,
    137 subsequently died from breast cancer within 7 years of enrollment.', Hazard
    ratios  and 95% confidence intervals  were estimated for intake of macronutrients
    as well as selected micronutrients and food groups from Cox proportional hazards
    regression models., 'After adjustment for factors at diagnosis, interval between
    diagnosis and diet assessment, and at follow-up, women in the highest compared
    to lowest quintile of intake of saturated fat and trans fat had a significantly
    higher risk of dying from any cause  for saturated fat;  for trans fat intake.',
  'Associations were similar, though did not achieve statistical significance, for
    breast cancer survival.', This study suggests that lower intake of saturated and
    trans fat in the post-diagnosis diet is associated with improved survival after
    breast cancer diagnosis., 'With a growing number of breast cancer survivors, there
    is tremendous interest in establishing whether changes in lifestyle influence
    breast cancer outcome.', Diet after the diagnosis of breast cancer has been investigated
    in both observational studies and randomized controlled trials., 'The Womens Intervention
    Nutrition Study  reported a 24%  = 240%) reduction in breast cancer relapse  in
    the low-fat dietary intervention  compared with the control group after a median
    follow-up of 5 years, but there was no effect on overall survival  = 0.89, 95%
    CI = 0.651.21).', The interpretation of findings is complicated by the substantial
    weight loss in the intervention group., The Womens Healthy Eating and Living  randomized
    trial demonstrated no effect of a low-fat dietary intervention  on breast cancer
    relapse  or survival after a mean follow-up of 7.3 years., Observational studies
    may help to inform the research question of diet after diagnosis by providing
    an opportunity to examine a wider variety of dietary factors and range of exposures.,
  'For example, both the WINS and WHEL interventions focused on reduction of total
    fat, rather than specific types of fat.', 'In contrast to the general population
    of breast cancer survivors in the US, WHEL participants already consumed a diet
    that met many of the intervention goals at baseline, eating on average 7.3 servings
    of fruits and vegetables per day.', Observational studies may provide a more representative
    sample of women consuming diets that reflect typical diets in the US., 'We investigated
    the association between post-diagnosis diet and breast cancer survival and overall
    survival in the Collaborative Womens Longevity Study, a large multi-center prospective
    cohort designed to examine the contribution of lifestyle to survival among women
    with breast cancer.', 'Women of ages 2079 years at breast cancer diagnosis were
    recruited into the CWLS after their participation in consecutive population-based
    casecontrol studies of breast cancer conducted in Wisconsin, Massachusetts, and
    New Hampshire between 1988 and 2001.', Details of both the casecontrol studies
    and the CWLS are provided elsewhere., The purpose of the CWLS was to evaluate
    associations between post-diagnosis lifestyle factors and survival., 'Briefly,
    5,791 cases from the parent casecontrol studies participated in the CWLS study
    by completing a mailed questionnaire from 1998 to 2001.', 'The CWLS questionnaire
    assessed post-diagnosis behaviors, including diet and physical activity, as well
    as breast cancer events and treatment.', Usual diet over the past year was assessed
    using a validated 126-item food frequency questionnaire., 'Macronutrients, expressed
    as a percentage of total energy intake, and select micronutrients were computed
    from FFQ data.', 'Participants were categorized into quintiles based on individual
    macronutrient, vitamin A, carotenoid, fiber, calcium, and vitamin D intake including
    intake from both diet and supplements.', Analyses were repeated restricting to
    micronutrients from diet alone to consider whether source of intake was affecting
    associations., 'Number of servings of meat, dairy, fruit, and vegetable intake
    was summed based on questionnaire items and grouped into quartiles.', 'Meat and
    dairy food groups were also grouped based on their fat content, and meat was examined
    separately by type.', 'Overall, 42% of women completed the CWLS questionnaire
    within 5 years of diagnosis of breast cancer.', We assessed all breast cancer
    cases for vital status regardless of whether they completed the CWLS questionnaire.,
  'We linked cases to the National Death Index records to obtain date and underlying
    cause of death, which has been shown to be a reliable source.', 'For this analysis,
    women were excluded if: energy intake was ;500 or &gt;5000 kcal per day as measured
    by the FFQ, disease or treatment interfered with diet, there was breast cancer
    metastases  or unknown disease stage at diagnosis, or women recorded any recurrence
    of breast cancer before entry into the CWLS.', 'Following these exclusions, the
    final analytic cohort comprised of 4,441 women.', 'Person-time of follow-up was
    calculated from the date of return of the CWLS questionnaire  until the date of
    death or December 31, 2005.', Cox proportional hazards regression was used to
    estimate HRs and 95% CI for all-cause and breast cancer survival according to
    nutrient and food intake and to adjust for covariates potentially associated with
    both diet and mortality., 'Fully-adjusted models included factors at diagnosis:
    age, state of residence, menopausal status, smoking, breast cancer stage, alcohol,
    history of hormone replacement therapy, and factors at follow-up: energy intake,
    breast cancer treatment, body mass index, and physical activity metabolic equivalents.',
  'Models further adjusted for years between diagnosis and diet assessment, and were
    energy-adjusted using the multivariate nutrient density method for macronutrients
    and the standard approach for micronutrients.', Tests of linear trend were conducted
    by including the median intake for each exposure category as an ordinal term in
    models., 'Analyses were repeated restricting the outcome to each of the top three
    causes of death: breast cancer, cardiovascular disease, and cancer at any site.',
  'To evaluate the possibility that severity of illness affected diet, we performed
    a subgroup analysis excluding: women who died within 2 years of completing the
    CWLS survey, women reporting recent unintentional weight loss, and women without
    a mammogram or physician breast exam after their diagnosis.', All reported P values
    are two-tailed without consideration of multiple comparisons; P values &lt;0.05
    were considered statistically significant., Analyses were conducted using SAS
    version 9.1., The majority of women were white  and postmenopausal at diagnosis.,
  'After a mean follow-up of 5.5  years after returning the questionnaire, we documented
    525 deaths, of which 26.1% were attributed to breast cancer.', The other most
    common causes of death were cardiovascular disease  and cancer at other sites.,
  'The proportion of women dying was higher among women who were older, had more advanced
    disease, were postmenopausal at diagnosis, and had a history of smoking, whereas
    the proportion dying was lower among those who reported being more physically
    active.', 'In contrast to all-cause survival, breast cancer survival was lower
    among younger women.', 'While all associations between energy and macronutrients
    with breast cancer survival were null, some associations with all-cause survival
    were statistically significant.', 'Total fat intake was not associated with all-cause
    or breast cancer survival, but type of fat intake did appear to influence risk
    of death from any cause.', Women with a median intake of 13% of calories from
    saturated fat had a 41% increased risk of death from any cause compared to women
    consuming a median of 7% calories from saturated fat., 'Furthermore, those in
    the upper quintile of trans fat intake had a 78% increased risk of death from
    any cause compared to those in the lowest quintile.', 'Though similar HRs for
    saturated and trans fat intake were observed for cause-specific survival, the
    associations were not statistically significant.', No consistent associations
    were observed between all-cause or breast cancer survival and monounsaturated
    or polyunsaturated fat intake., "Association of total energy and macronutrient
    intake with all-cause and breast cancer survival, CWLS  \n\nbHazard ratio  adjusted
    for factors at diagnosis, interval between diagnosis and diet assessment, and
    factors at follow-up \n\nCarbohydrate and protein intakes were not associated
    with all-cause or breast cancer survival.", 'We observed a trend toward lower
    risk of death from any cause with higher alcohol consumption, but this trend was
    not present for breast cancer survival.', 'When restricting analyses to deaths
    related to cardiovascular disease, there was a non-statistically significant  inverse
    association between trans fat intake and survival, and positive associations with
    polyunsaturated fat  and alcohol intakes  with cardiovascular disease survival.',
  'Sensitivity analyses were conducted restricting attention to women who survived
    at least 2 years after completing the CWLS survey, reported no recent unintentional
    weight loss, and had a mammogram or physician breast exam after their diagnosis.',
  'For all-cause survival, the associations with saturated fat  and trans fat  were
    robust, but the association with alcohol was null.', There was a non-statistically
    significant trend towards a decreased risk of death from breast cancer with higher
    calcium and a positive association with lycopene intake; no association was observed
    for the other selected micronutrients., Associations between diet and all-cause
    and breast cancer survival were similar to those presented after excluding supplements.,
  'There was a non-significant inverse trend  between calcium intake and breast cancer
    death, but there were no other associations between consumption of the selected
    micronutrients and breast cancer survival.', "Association of micronutrient intake
    with all-cause and breast cancer survival, CWLS  \n\nbHazard ratio  adjusted for
    factors at diagnosis, interval between diagnosis and diet assessment, and factors
    at follow-up \n\nMeat and dairy are two of the largest contributors to saturated
    fat intake.", No significant associations were observed between all-cause and
    breast cancer survival and intakes of meat and dairy products., 'We also examined
    meat and dairy servings/day according to fat intake  as well as type of meat,
    but there were no associations for all-cause or breast cancer specific survival.',
  'Since fruits and vegetables, particularly cruciferous vegetables, may be associated
    with a reduced risk of cancer, we also examined the relation between produce intake
    and all-cause and breast cancer survival; no association was observed.', "Associations
    of selected food group intake with all-cause and breast cancer survival, CWLS
    \ \n\nbHazard ratio  adjusted for factors at diagnosis, interval between diagnosis
    and diet assessment, and factors at follow-up \n\nIn this large cohort of breast
    cancer survivors, post-diagnosis diets high in saturated and trans fat were associated
    with decreased all-cause survival.", 'Though there were suggestive dietary associations
    for breast cancer survival, none were statistically significant.', 'Women who
    consumed the highest quartile of saturated fat  had a 41% statistically significant
    higher risk of all-cause survival compared to women in the lowest quartile, who
    consumed a median of 7% calories from saturated fat.', Doubling percentage of
    energy from trans fat was associated with a 78% statistically significantly greater
    risk of death., 'A recent report from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention
    indicated that saturated fat intake as a percentage of energy intake decreased
    between 1971 and 2000 among US women from 13 to 11%, but energy intake has increased
    over this period, suggesting similar exposure to absolute amounts of saturated
    fat over time.', 'Average trans fat intake in the United States during the enrollment
    period for this study was approximately 23% of energy, which is greater than reported
    by participants of this study.', 'Despite a large body of evidence that alcohol
    increases risk of breast cancer, there was no association between alcohol intake
    and breast cancer survival.', 'Others have recently reported either no association
    between alcohol intake and survival or an inverse relation between alcohol intake
    and survival, so this area warrants further study.', 'Similar to our findings,
    qualitative reviews reported no consistent association between total fat consumption
    either pre- or post-diagnosis and breast cancer survival after energy adjustment.',
  None of the studies reviewed by Rock and Demark-Wahnefried reported an association
    between total dietary fiber intake and breast cancer recurrence or overall survival;
    only three studies reported an inverse association between fruit and vegetable
    consumption and survival., 'Strengths of our study include the prospective design,
    its large sample size, and detailed information on diet obtained after the diagnosis
    of breast cancer.', 'In addition, we were able to assess many potential confounding
    variables.', The relation between saturated and trans fat intake and all-cause
    survival that we observed is consistent with observational and controlled-feeding
    studies of cardiovascular disease and other chronic diseases., This also supports
    the ability of our dietary assessment to detect moderate associations with survival.,
  'When restricting attention to deaths related to cardiovascular disease, there were
    suggestive  inverse associations between trans fat and survival, and positive
    associations between polyunsaturated fat  as well as alcohol  with survival, although
    these associations likely did not reach statistical significance, possibly because
    of the limited number of observed deaths.', 'Nonetheless, some limitations should
    be considered when interpreting these results.', 'Though we used a validated self-reported
    measure of diet adapted from the Nurses Health Study, measurement error is a pervasive
    problem in dietary assessment.', 'Because measurement error is likely non-differential
    with respect to outcome, this should lead to attenuation in risk estimates.',
  'We lacked information on the clinical status of breast cancer at the time of the
    CWLS questionnaire, but we excluded women who reported any recurrence of breast
    cancer at that time.', 'Also, survival may depend upon hormone responsiveness,
    but steroid receptor status was not available from state cancer registries for
    all CWLS participants.', 'The CWLS involved women that were previously enrolled
    in our sequential casecontrol studies of breast cancer, and thus women were not
    immediately followed from the initial diagnosis of their breast cancer.', One
    practical limitation of the data is that our results may only be applicable to
    women who survive the first several years after breast cancer diagnosis., A potential
    concern is that the observed inverse associations with survival might reflect
    reverse causation if increased saturated and trans fat intakes are associated
    with worsening health and poor prognosis., 'The relatively short interval, however,
    between diagnosis and subsequent entry into the cohort for the majority of women
    minimizes the likelihood of bias caused by selective survival.', 'Also, information
    was available on a number of surrogate measures including treatment interfering
    with diet, recent unintentional weight loss, general health status, and frequency
    of mammogram or physician breast or chest wall examination after diagnosis, and
    hazard ratios were essentially unchanged in analyses restricted to women in apparent
    good health at the time of CWLS entry and who had undergone screening since diagnosis.',
  'Taken together, these results suggest that reverse causation is unlikely to account
    for the inverse association of saturated and trans fat intake with overall survival
    in these data.', 'Finally, our study did not consider diet prior to breast cancer
    diagnosis, or the pre- to post-diagnosis change in dietary patterns.', 'Our study,
    instead, was designed to inform how a womans post-diagnosis diet influences survival.',
  'This research provides little evidence for an association between dietary intake
    and breast cancer survival, but provides additional support for an adverse relationship
    between saturated and trans fat intake and overall survival following a breast
    cancer diagnosis.', 'This research was supported by grants from the Susan G. Komen
    Breast Cancer Foundation  and the National Cancer Institute, National Institutes
    of Health, and Department of Health and Human Services.']
