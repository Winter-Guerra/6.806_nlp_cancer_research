    as they can be consumed for longer periods of time without any adverse effects.',
  Flavonoids are a broadly distributed class of plant pigments that are regularly
    consumed in the human diet due to their abundance., 'One such flavonoid, fisetin,
    is found in various fruits and vegetables, such as strawberry, apple, persimmon,

    Dietary modifications can lead to extensive differences in the risks and incidences
    of several types of cancers.', 'Recently, the use of natural dietary substances
    found in fruits, vegetables, and herbs has received considerable attention as
    chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic agents worldwide.', The approach of cancer
    prevention using nontoxic novel plant-derived agents has been encouraged by many
    researchers., 'Flavonoids are commonly found in most plants and exert a significant
    range of biological activities such as antioxidant, anticarcinogenic, anti-inflammatory,
    antibacterial, immune-stimulating, and antiviral.', Flavonoids and their polymers
    comprise one of the largest groups of phytonutrients that afford beneficial health
    effects., These important polyphenolic compounds under the class of plant secondary
    metabolites exert significant effects in the biological system., 'It was reported
    that the average total intake of flavonoids in the United States was 1 g/day ;
    however, the intake differs extensively.', 'Fisetin  is a bioactive flavonol molecule
    found in fruits and vegetables such as strawberry, apple, persimmon, grape, onion,
    and cucumber at concentrations in the range of 2160 g/g.', 'A preliminary database
    was built from the field study in Iwate Prefecture, Japan, to estimate the amount
    of flavonoids and isoflavonoids ingested by Japanese.', 'The intake of flavonoids
    and isoflavonoids was estimated by calculations from the database and based upon
    a preliminary examination of 40 food items, covering at least 80% of total food
    consumption.', Fisetin was measured in freeze-dried vegetables and fruits after
    acid hydrolysis of the parent glycosides., Average daily intake of fisetin per
    capita of flavonoids was computed as 0.4 mg., The highest concentration of fisetin
    was found in strawberries  followed by apple  and persimmon., Other dietary sources
    of fisetin and their concentrations are provided in Figure 2., 'In the past years,
    fisetin was a subject of research because of its presence in various human foods
    and its antiproliferative, apoptotic, and antioxidant  activities.', Fisetin has
    been reported as a chemopreventive/chemotherapeutic agent in several types of
    cancer and also as a neuroprotective agent., Several studies indicate that fisetin
    is a promising novel antioxidant., 'In this review article, we discuss the current

    The ability of flavonoids to scavenge free radicals contributes to their marked
    antioxidant activity and significant biological effects.', 'The oxygen radicals
    damage lipids, amino acids, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids.', 'When an imbalance
    occurs between antioxidants and reactive oxygen species, it results in oxidative
    stress and is a consequence of a mismatch between the production of the reactive
    oxygen species and the ability to defend against them.', 'It has been implicated
    in the development of many diseases, including diabetes mellitus, retinal degeneration,
    neurodegenerative diseases, mutagenesis, carcinogenesis, and ageing.', Antioxidative
    properties of fisetin have been examined by both cyclic voltammetry- and quantum-chemical-based
    calculations., The trolox-equivalent activity concentration  value of fisetin
    has been reported to be 2.800.06., Fisetin was found to be a planar molecule exerting
    a cross-conjugation effect., The hydroxyl bond  dissociation energy and dipole
    moment specified that fisetin had high antioxidant capacity., It has been reported
    that fisetin strongly binds between the polar head and hydrophobic tail of the
    phospholipids around the interfacial region of the egg phosphatidylcholine liposomes.,
  This region is easily available to the free radicals  and serves as the reaction
    site for the antioxidant activity of the fisetin molecule and inhibits lipid peroxidation.,
  'The high antioxidant capacity was confirmed by semiempirical calculations for fisetin,
    with the effectiveness for extracting OH from the surrounding medium predicted
    to decrease in the order 3-OH&gt;3-OH&gt;4-OH&gt;7-OH.', 'Recently, Mohapatra
    and Mishra studied the photophysiological action of fisetin incorporated in liposomes
    using a dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine  bilayer membrane system.', 'It was found
    that fisetin partitioned well into the membrane in solid gel and liquid crystalline
    phases, and the fisetin molecules were generally present near the head group region
    of the lipid bilayer membrane.', 'There were variations of fluorescence intensity,
    lifetime, and anisotropy parameters in cholesterol-containing DMPC membranes,
    in mixed phospholipids, and as a function of temperature by membrane-bound fisetin,
    suggesting that fisetin can be an efficient fluorescent molecular probe for sensing
    lipid-bilayer membrane-related changes.', Fisetin has been reported to inhibit
    human low-density lipoprotein  oxidation in vitro., 'It induced quinone oxidoreductase
    activity in murine hepatoma 1c1c7 cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner,
    and the induction of activity was associated with increase in mRNA expression.',
  Fisetin also activated the antioxidant-/electrophile-response element as shown by
    transfection studies., 'Fisetin along with quercetin and myricetin had the lowest
    oxidation potential, more active than trolox, and seemed to be the most active
    compound in ferric-reducing antioxidant power assay, which determines the reducing
    capacity of a compound directly.', 'It was suggested that the o-dihydroxy structure
    in the B ring and the 3-hydroxy group and 2,3-double bond in the C ring contribute
    to the antioxidant activity of fisetin.', 'The effects of fisetin, morin, and
    myricetin were investigated on the susceptibility of LDL to oxidative modification
    and on oxLDL uptake in macrophages.', 'Fisetin had stronger inhibitory activity
    than morin and myricetin in inhibiting Cu2+-mediated LDL oxidation measured by
    thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances assay, conjugated diene formation, and
    electrophoretic mobility.', 'It was found that fisetin, morin, and myricetin prevented
    LDL from oxidation, in part, through reducing CD36 gene expression in macrophages,
    a possible effect in ameliorating atherosclerosis.', Fisetin has been shown to
    increase intracellular glutathione  levels in the mouse hippocampal HT-22 cells
    both in the presence and absence of glutamate., 'The increase in GSH metabolism
    provides protection from glutamate, as glutamate decreases the level of GSH by
    inhibiting the uptake of cystine necessary for the production of GSH.', 'Treatment
    of primary rat neurons with fisetin afforded protection against the peroxynitrite
    donor, SIN-1-mediated alterations in inducing extracellular signal-regulated kinase
    /c-myc phosphorylation, nuclear NF-E2-related factor-2  levels, glutamate cystine
    ligase levels, GSH concentration, and cell viability.', 'Recently, the effect
    of fisetin on the upregulation of heme oxygenase-1  was investigated in human
    umbilical vein endothelial cells.', The induction of HO-1 in fisetin-stimulated
    endothelial cells was diminished by small interfering RNA and pharmacological
    inhibitors of PKC- and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase., Treatment with fisetin
    caused increased Nrf2 nuclear translocation and activity., 'There was also reduction

    Emerging data from in vitro and in vivo studies indicate that fisetin possesses
    antiproliferative properties against several cancers.', Its potential value in
    cancer prevention and treatment was further underscored from recent reports that
    show that fisetin may reduce angiogenesis and consequently suppress tumor growth
    through inhibition of urokinase plasminogen activator., 'A screening study that
    evaluated the effect of 17 structure-related flavonoids found fisetin to be a
    potent inhibitor of the matrix metalloproteinase -1 activity, a key enzyme in
    remodeling and degradation of the extracellular matrix, with an important role
    in cancer progression.', Fisetin is known to rapidly compromise microtubule drug-induced
    mitotic block in a proteasome-dependent manner in several human cell lines., It
    caused premature initiation of chromosome segregation and exit from mitosis without
    normal cytokinesis in unperturbed human cancer cells., 'The consequences of fisetin
    treatment on the localization and phosphorylation of several mitotic proteins
    were analyzed in cell culture studies, and it was found that Aurora B, Bub1, BubR1,
    and Cenp-F rapidly lost their kinetochore/centromere localization upon addition
    of fisetin to the culture medium.', 'In addition, Aurora B kinase was identified
    as a novel direct target of fisetin, and its activity was significantly reduced
    by fisetin in vitro.', 'Fisetin was tested for genotoxicity in human lymphoblastoid
    cell lines, and the cells were analyzed for malsegregating chromosomes as well
    as for the induction of micronuclei.', Olaharski et al., employed the CREST micronucleus
    assay to discriminate between micronuclei formed from chromosomal breakage  and
    chromosomal loss  in fisetin-treated cells., 'A statistically significant increase
    in CREST-positive micronuclei suggested that at low concentrations, fisetin exerted
    genotoxic effects primarily through chromosomal loss.', 'Further studies showed
    that fisetin is an effective inhibitor of the nuclear enzyme human topoisomerase
    II-, essential for DNA replication, and interfered with chromosome segregation
    during the anaphase and telophase periods of the cell cycle.', It was thereby
    concluded that fisetin acted both as an aneugen  and a clastogen., 'At low doses,
    fisetin was capable of interfering with proper chromosomal segregation and acted
    as an aneugen, whereas at higher concentrations, fisetin through effective inhibition
    of topoisomerase II inhibitor exerted clastogenic effects causing double-stranded
    DNA breaks in the cells.', 'Treatment with fisetin suppressed activation of HMC-1
    mast cells by interfering with cell-to-cell interaction and inhibiting the activity
    of nuclear factor-kappa B  and MAPK, demonstrating its potential as an anti-inflammatory
    agent.', Fisetin induced apoptotic cell death in a variety of cancer cell lines.,
  'However, there is clear evidence that fisetin-mediated antiproliferative and proapoptotic
    effects were targeted specifically to cancer cells, and the normal cells were
    much less affected by fisetin treatment.', It is possible that differential modulation
    of cell-signaling pathways in cancer cells versus their normal counterparts is
    responsible for this selective effect of fisetin., 'In the next section, we have
    reviewed the available literature on the effects of fisetin in various cancers,
    both in cell lines and in vivo models.', The molecular targets of fisetin are
    shown in Figure 3., 'The anticarcinogenic effects of fisetin in in vitro and in
    vivo models are provided in Tables 1 and 2, respectively.', Table 1., 'Summary
    of the Anticarcinogenic Effects of Fisetin in In-Vitro Studies


    Lung cancer is reckoned to be one of the most common cancers in the world for
    several decades, and metastatic lung cancer is responsible for more than 90% of
    lung cancer-related deaths.', 'Different molecular mechanisms enable tumor cells
    to infiltrate the surrounding tissue, invade blood vessels, and spread to distant
    sites.', Efforts are being directed to discover novel agents that can modulate
    these pathways and prevent migration and invasion of tumor cells., 'Initial studies
    exploring the effect of fisetin on lung cancer showed that fisetin effectively
    inhibited adhesion, migration, and invasion of human A549 lung cancer cells.',
  This was associated with decreased phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and downregulation
    of the expression of MMP-2 and uPA at both the protein and mRNA levels., 'Fisetin
    inhibited the nuclear translocation and activation of transcription factors NF-B
    and AP-1, upstream regulators of MMP-2 and uPA.', 'These studies were extended
    in our laboratory, where we showed that fisetin decreased the viability and clonogenicity
    of A549 lung cancer cells through modulation of AMP-activated protein kinase /Akt/mammalian
    target of rapamycin  signaling.', The study identified mTOR as a key target of
    fisetin and used in silico modeling to examine the physical interaction of fisetin
    with the mTOR molecule., It was shown that fisetin binds to two sites on the mTOR
    molecule., 'The binding energies were in the 7 to 8 kcal/mol range, and the binding
    site included hydrogen bonding to a glutamate by two OH groups.', The proposed
    mechanism through which fisetin targets mTOR signaling in cancer cells is shown
    in Figure 4B., 'Cell culture studies showed that fisetin treatment decreased the
    protein expression of PI3K, and inhibited the phosphorylation of Akt, mTOR, p70S6K1,
    and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E -binding protein 1.', 'Fisetin-treated cells
    exhibited inhibition of the constituents of mTOR-signaling complex such as Rictor,
    Raptor, GL, and PRAS40, suggesting that the growth inhibitory effects of fisetin
    were mediated, in part, through inhibition of mTOR signaling.', Further proof
    of its anticancer activity was obtained from an in vivo study where fisetin conferred
    protection against benzopyrene -induced lung carcinogenesis., 'Treatment with
    fisetin reduced histological lesions, lipid peroxidation, and the levels of enzymatic
    and nonenzymatic antioxidants in the lungs of BP-exposed mice.', 'In another study,
    fisetin administered intraperitoneally to Lewis lung carcinoma-bearing mice resulted
    in a marked decrease in tumor volume when compared to the untreated mice.', 'Fisetin
    treatment in combination with cyclophosphamide was found to induce greater tumor
    inhibition, when assessed by tumor growth curves.', 'The decrease in tumor volume
    was linked to the antiangiogenic effect of fisetin, as treated tumors had significant
    reduction in the microvessel density.', 'These studies demonstrate that fisetin,
    alone or as an adjuvant, could be effective in the treatment of solid tumors.',
  FIG., '4.', Fisetin and mTOR signaling., Hypothetical model of the mammalian target
    of rapamycin  molecule in complex with fisetin., Blind docking of fisetin to the
    mTOR target was performed with autodock 4 by setting grid sizes that included
    the entire mTOR molecule., The structure consists of four stacked alpha helices.,
  'The grid size for the docking site was expanded to include the entire mTOR molecule,
    and fisetin was docked.', 'Using autodock 4, it was shown that fisetin bound to
    two sites on the mTOR target.', The binding energies were in the 7 to 8 kcal/mol
    range for the binding constant., The binding in the best site included hydrogen
    bonding to a glutamate by two hydroxyl groups., Adapted from Khan et al.., Proposed
    mechanism through which fisetin targets mTOR signaling in cancer cells., Colon
    cancer is one such type of cancer where dietary modification has been well documented
    to play an important role in reducing the risk of carcinogenesis., 'In this context,
    the effects of dietary flavonoids have been examined in colon cancer cells.',
  Kuntz et al., 'screened more than 30 flavonoids for their effects on cell proliferation
    and potential cytotoxicity in the human colon cancer cell line Caco-2, which displays
    features of small-intestinal epithelial cells, and in the HT-29 cells, which resemble
    colonic crypt cells.', 'Studies on the dose-dependent effects of flavonoids showed
    antiproliferative activity of all compounds with EC50 values ranging between 39.72.3
    and 203.615.5 M. The mechanism of growth inhibition of fisetin was further explored,
    and it was shown that fisetin-induced cell cycle arrest in HT-29 cells was at
    least in part mediated through inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinases.', Cell
    culture studies demonstrated that fisetin decreased the protein levels of cdk-2
    and 4., These findings were validated in cell-free systems where fisetin was shown
    to inhibit cdk-4 activity directly., We examined the molecular signaling pathways
    upstream of cdks that were modulated by fisetin- mediated growth inhibition.,
  Our data showed that fisetin induced apoptosis and targeted the cyclooxygenase 2  and
    Wnt/epidermal growth factor receptor /NF-B-signaling in HT29 colon cancer cells.,
  Fisetin selectively inhibited COX2 expression and decreased prostaglandin E2  secretion
    without affecting COX1 protein expression., 'Furthermore, fisetin-mediated inhibition
    of Wnt/-catenin signaling was associated with downregulation of the transcription
    factor T-cell factor -4, and decreased expression of -catenin target genes such
    as cyclin D1 and MMP-7.', 'In HCT-116 colon cancer cells, fisetin reportedly induced
    apoptosis via activation of both death receptor  and mitochondrial-dependent pathways
    and subsequent activation of the caspase cascade.', Fisetin suppressed the protein
    levels of antiapoptotic Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 and increased proapoptotic Bak and Bim.,
  'Fisetin-mediated activation of p53 contributed to the mitochondrial translocation
    of Bax via a transcription-independent pathway, and was responsible, at least
    in part, for the apoptosis observed in HCT-116 cells.', 'Additionally, fisetin
    caused an increase in the protein levels of cleaved caspase-8, Fas ligand, DR5,
    and tumor necrosis factor -related apoptosis-inducing ligand.', 'Securin, overexpressed
    in several types of cancer, is known to negatively regulate the transcription
    and subsequent apoptotic activity of the tumor suppressor p53.', 'It was shown
    that depletion of securin enhanced fisetin-induced apoptosis in human colon cancer
    cells, while fisetin-induced apoptosis was blocked by overexpression of wild-type
    or nondegradable securin.', 'Moreover, fisetin inhibited securin expression regardless
    of p53 status, and knockdown of securin by siRNA enhanced fisetin-induced apoptosis
    in p53-null HCT116 cells.', 'Fisetin pretreatment enhanced the radiosensitivity
    of p53-mutant HT-29 cancer cells, prolonged radiation-induced G2/M phase cell
    cycle arrest, and augmented radiation-induced caspase-dependent apoptosis.', 'At
    the molecular level, fisetin induced the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, and suppressed
    the phosphorylation of Akt and ERK1/2 in these cells.', 'In conclusion, fisetin
    inhibits growth and induces apoptosis in colon cancer cells through targeting
    multiple pathways.', Studies conducted to identify novel flavonoids with antiproliferative
    activity have ascertained fisetin as a potent inhibitor of prostate cancer cell
    growth., 'The efficacy of the synthetic flavonoid 2,2-dihydroxychalcone  was compared
    with that of the naturally occurring fisetin.', Both compounds decreased cell
    viability and clonogenicity associated with a concomitant increase in apoptosis
    in prostate cancer cells., 'The synthetic compound DHC, however, showed cytotoxic
    activity at lower concentrations.', Gene expression studies showed that the cell
    cycle regulatory genes were among the most highly represented functional category
    of genes altered., 'Of the hundred cell cycle genes altered by DHC and fisetin,
    27 genes with key functions in the G2/M phase were downregulated by both compounds.',
  'The other functional categories that were modulated included chromosome organization,
    apoptosis, and stress-response genes.', Fisetin has been found to induce cell
    death in prostate cancer cells through the activation of the apoptotic and autophagic
    pathways., 'We showed that fisetin treatment resulted in induction of apoptosis
    in LNCaP cells, with activation of the caspase cascade.', This was accompanied
    by arrest of cells in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle., 'Fisetin decreased the
    viability of prostate cancer cells, but had minimal effect on normal prostate
    epithelial cells.', 'As in colon cancer cells, fisetin augmented TRAIL-mediated
    cytotoxicity and apoptosis in prostate cancer cells by activating the extrinsic
    and intrinsic apoptotic pathways.', Cotreatment with TRAIL and fisetin caused
    significant activation of caspase-8 and caspase-3 and disruption of mitochondrial
    potential in these cells., Fisetin increased the protein expression of the TRAIL
    receptor and decreased the activation and nuclear translocation of NF-B., Fisetin
    also acts as a dual inhibitor of PI3K/Akt and mTOR signaling in prostate cancer
    cells., A recent study from our laboratory showed that fisetin treatment of androgen-independent
    phosphatase and tensin homolog -negative human PC-3 prostate cancer cells leads
    to the induction of programmed autophagic cell death., 'The process of autophagy
    is promoted by AMPK, a key energy sensor that regulates cellular metabolism to
    maintain energy homeostasis.', Treatment of PC-3 cells with fisetin induced the
    activation of AMPK and inhibited not only the basal expression of mTOR but also
    its phosphorylation at Ser2481 and Ser2448., 'The decrease in mTOR activity was
    associated with downregulation of Raptor, Rictor, PRAS40, and GL with subsequent
    loss of formation of mTOR complexes.', The dual inhibition of mTOR complexes  resulted
    in negative regulation of the feedback loop through which the mTORRictor complex
    activates Akt with subsequent repression of Akt signaling., 'Furthermore, fisetin
    through inhibition of mTOR targets rpS6, eIF4B, and 4EBP1 suppressed cap-dependent
    translation in PC-3 cells.', 'Interestingly, another study by Yang et al.', in
    MCF-7 breast cancer cells showed that fisetin-induced apoptosis was accompanied
    by inhibition of autophagy., 'These diverse reports indicate that there are multiple
    mechanisms through which fisetin exerts its antitumor activity, which may vary
    with the cell type.', 'Fisetin can inhibit the adhesion, migration, and invasive
    behavior of cancer cells.', Chien et al., demonstrated that the antimetastatic
    potential of fisetin was related to suppression of the PI3K/Akt and JNK signaling
    with concomitant downregulation of MMPs in prostate cancer cells., 'The androgen
    receptor  signaling pathway, which is essential for prostate development and normal
    function, is central to prostate cancers pathogenesis and progression.', 'The
    key enzyme in AR signaling, 5-reductase, catalyzes the conversion of testosterone
    to the more potent androgen dihydrotestosterone, a process known to amplify androgenic
    response and linked to the development of prostate cancer in humans.', 'Interestingly,
    fisetin possesses higher affinity for the AR than dihydrotestosterone.', We showed
    that fisetin interacts with the ligand-binding domain of the AR and interferes
    with its amino-/carboxyl-terminal interactions with subsequent reduction in receptor
    stability., 'This resulted in blunting of AR-mediated transactivation of target
    genes, including the prostate-specific antigen, an established diagnostic serum
    marker for monitoring the presence and progression of prostate cancer in human
    patients.', 'Furthermore, treatment with fisetin significantly slowed the progression
    of tumor growth in athymic nude mice implanted with CWR22R1 prostate cancer cells.',
  'Importantly, the tumor growth inhibition followed a significant decrease in the
    serum levels of PSA, indicating an AR-specific effect.', These findings further
    suggest that fisetin could be exploited to delay the progression of prostate cancer.,
  'Effective systemic therapies for pancreatic adenocarcinoma are lacking, in part
    because of the intrinsic drug resistance of this disease.', Studies performed
    in our laboratory demonstrate that fisetin negatively regulates the growth of
    chemoresistant pancreatic cancer cells., DRs of the TNF receptor superfamily have
    been implicated in the constitutive activation of prosurvival NF-B signaling in
    pancreatic cancer cells., We showed that fisetin induced apoptosis and inhibited
    invasion of pancreatic cancer cells through suppression of DR3-mediated NF-B activation.,
  Fisetin treatment resulted in dose-dependent inhibition of cancer cell growth and
    proliferation with concomitant induction of apoptosis., The effect of fisetin
    was analyzed on a subset of 113 genes with known relevance to cancer cell transformation
    and tumorigenesis., 'Compared to vehicle-treated cells, fisetin treatment caused
    significant modulation in the expression of many genes that were either unregulated
    or downregulated ranging between 1.5-fold and 7-fold.', 'The highly upregulated
    genes were mostly related to cell cycle control, invasion, and metastasis, whereas
    the downregulated genes included the antiapoptotic BCL2L1 and genes involved in
    cell invasion, proliferation, and metastasis such as NF-B, MMP-9, EGFR, and HER-2.',
  'Interestingly, maximal decrease was observed in the DR3 gene expression and was
    accompanied with a parallel increase in the expression levels of IB, the NF-B
    inhibitor.', 'Cell culture studies further showed that fisetin treatment resulted
    in a decrease in the activity of NF-B/p65, MMP-9, and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis  and
    signaling molecules associated with chemoresistance in pancreatic cancer cells.',
  'Importantly, we found that transient downregulation of DR3 by RNA interference
    or blocking with an extracellular-domain-blocking antibody significantly augmented
    fisetin-induced changes in cell proliferation, cell invasion, and apoptosis with
    concomitant decrease in MMP-9, XIAP, and NF-B DNA-binding activity.', These observations
    validated findings from other cancer cell models that point to NF-B/MMP signaling
    as an important target of fisetin., Pancreatic cancer cells are known to express
    the multidrug resistance-associated protein -1 responsible for the efflux of drugs
    from the cell., Nguyen et al., screened the effect of dietary flavonoids on the
    transport of daunomycin and vinblastine in a pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell line.,
  They found that fisetin significantly decreased the accumulation of both drugs in
    the plasma in contrast to other flavonoids., 'However, another study done in doxorubicin-resistant
    human sarcoma cells showed that fisetin significantly enhanced doxorubicin accumulation
    in these cells.', These apparently contrasting data suggest that in-depth studies
    are needed to explore the efficacy of fisetin in pancreatic cancer., Malignant
    melanoma is a deadly human cancer with no effective cure for the metastatic disease.,
  We recently showed that treatment of metastatic human melanoma cells with fisetin
    resulted in decreased cell viability with G1-phase arrest., Fisetin disrupted
    the Wnt/-catenin signaling pathway in melanoma cells and downregulated Wnt protein
    and its coreceptors., 'In contrast, the protein expression of endogenous Wnt inhibitors
    Dickkopf and Wnt inhibitory factor -1 was increased with fisetin treatment.',
  Fisetin-mediated increase in the cytosolic levels of Axin and -transducin repeat-containing
    protein  and decrease in the phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3 - corresponded
    to decreased nuclear -catenin levels., 'Fisetin interfered with the functional
    cooperation between -catenin and the transcription factor LEF-1/TCF-2, resulting
    in downregulation of known -catenin targets such as c-myc, Brn-2, and microphthalmia-associated
    transcription factor.', 'We showed that fisetin was able to over-ride the proliferative
    effect of MITF, an oncogene amplified in 20% of metastatic melanomas, and induced
    growth repression in MITF-overexpressing melanoma cells.', We validated our in
    vitro findings in a melanoma xenograft mouse model., Intraperitoneal administration
    of fisetin to athymic nude mice implanted with metastatic melanoma cells resulted
    in significant inhibition of melanoma tumor development and was associated with
    a decrease in endogenous MITF protein levels., 'This study published in the Journal
    of Investigative Dermatology was highlighted and chosen for commentary by Arbiser
    and Fisher, where they emphasized the need to explore the potential of dietary
    agents in the fight against cancer.', The editorial described fisetin as a natural
    fist against melanoma and appropriately elucidated that a rejuvenated interest
    in natural products combined with modern methods of target identification might
    be an important tool in the fight against melanoma., Figure 5 depicts the proposed

    It is well known that cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative diseases are a leading
    cause of death worldwide.', 'Oxidative stress can lead to neuronal death in stroke
    and oxidative reactions have been recognized in arteriosclerosis, which is the
    main pathological condition leading to stroke.', The neuroprotective effects of
    fisetin are shown in Figure 6., 'Several flavonoids were studied for their ability
    to induce neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells, which is a well-studied model system
    of neuronal differentiation.', It was found that fisetin was the most effective
    flavonoid that induced neurite outgrowth by inducing ERK1/2 activation and PC12
    cell differentiation., 'To investigate if ERK1/2 activation by fisetin is required
    for neurite outgrowth, three structurally unrelated inhibitors of the MAPK pathway
    were used, and fisetin-induced ERK1/2 activation was blocked by all of these inhibitors,
    suggesting the involvement of ERK1/2 in fisetin-mediated effects.', 'Moreover,
    similar effects were observed on treatment with these inhibitors on fisetin-induced
    neurite outgrowth.', 'Treatment of the PC12 cells with farnesyl transferase inhibitor
    FTI277 blocked fisetin-induced ERK1/2 activation and caused significant reduction
    in fisetin-induced differentiation, demonstrating that Ras activation is required
    for the observed effects of fisetin.', Fisetin activated ERK1/2 and induced cAMP-response
    element-binding protein  phosphorylation in rat hippocampal slices and enhanced
    object recognition in mice., It was shown that fisetin enabled long-term memory
    potentiation and therefore may be useful for treating patients with memory disorders.,
  'This is consistent with recent studies showing that activation of ERK provides
    neuroprotection, while specific inhibition of ERK activation enhances neuronal
    cell death.', 'Furthermore, reduced signaling by growth factors such as EGF-1
    that activate the Ras-ERK cascade has been found in patients suffering from Huntingtons
    disease  as well as in disease models, signifying that ERK activation might provide
    a novel therapeutic approach to prevent neuronal dysfunction.', 'In agreement
    with the aforementioned ERK-mediated neurotrophic effect of fisetin, most of the
    data available in literature indicate that fisetin does not exert an inhibitory
    effect on ERK1/2 signaling.', Kim et al., 'showed that fisetin suppressed the
    activation of NF-B and JNK MAPKs, but not ERK in lipopolysaccharide -stimulated
    mouse macrophages.', 'In another comparative study where apigenin, luteolin, and
    fisetin were investigated for their inhibitory effects on TNF--induced NF-B transcriptional
    activation, it was shown that fisetin enhanced and sustained the activation of
    ERK and JNK in response to TNF-.', 'However, in contrast to the above reports,
    one study has shown that fisetin suppressed the invasion and migration of lung
    cancer cells through inhibition of the ERK activity.', 'Given these conflicting
    results, further studies are required to understand the dual effects of fisetin
    on ERK signaling and to delineate the intricate mechanisms involved in its effect
    on normal versus cancer cells.', Maher et al., developed a cell culture-based
    assay as a screening tool to identify compounds that might be effective for the
    treatment of stroke., 'In mouse hippocampal cell line HT22 in combination with
    chemical ischemia, they did an initial screening for potential neuroprotective
    drugs among a group of flavonoids.', 'The biochemical assays for ATP, GSH, and
    for the long-term induction of antioxidant proteins were performed to provide
    further screening.', Fisetin was tested in the small-clot embolism model of cerebral
    ischemia in rabbits based upon the results of these screens., 'It was found that
    there was reduction in the behavioral deficits after stroke, upon treatment with
    fisetin.', Additional studies investigated the effect on the infarct size and
    the inflammatory response in a mouse model of stroke., Treatment with fisetin
    afforded protection to brain tissue against ischemic reperfusion injury when given
    before ischemia and also when applied 3 h after ischemia., There was inhibition
    of the infiltration of macrophages and dendritic cells into the ischemic hemisphere
    and suppression of the intracerebral immune cell activation., 'Fisetin treatment
    caused suppression of NF-B activation and JNK1/2/Jun phosphorylation, associated
    with inhibition of LPS-induced TNF- production.', 'In vitro studies showed that
    fisetin treatment suppressed the production of TNF-, nitric oxide, and PGE2 in
    LPS-stimulated BV-2 microglial cells or primary microglial cultures.', 'There
    was inhibition of the gene expression of TNF-, interleukin -1, COX-2, and inducible
    nitric oxide synthase at both mRNA and protein levels and suppression of IB degradation,
    nuclear translocation of NF-B, and phosphorylation of p38 MAPK in the LPS-stimulated
    BV-2 microglial cells.', 'Treatment with fisetin reduced the cytotoxicity of LPS-stimulated
    microglia toward B35 neuroblastoma cells in a coculture system, suggesting that
    fisetin has a strong anti-inflammatory activity in brain microglia.', Fisetin
    has been shown to affect multiple pathways involved in the maintenance of neuronal
    function during aging., 'It acts as an antioxidant, increases GSH, maintains mitochondrial
    function in the presence of oxidative stress, has anti-inflammatory activity against
    microglial cells, and inhibits the activity of 5-lipoxygenase, signifying that
    fisetin causes reduction in the age-related decline in brain function.', 'The
    ability of fisetin to prevent neuronal dysfunction was examined in three different
    models of HD:  in PC12 cells that expressed the mutant huntingtin  protein under
    the control of an inducible promoter,  in Drosophila expressing mutant Httex1,
    and  in the R6/2 mouse model of HD.', It was shown that fisetin reduced the impact
    of mutant huntingtin protein in all of these models and might be useful for the
    treatment of HD by inducing the activation of ERK1/2., The antidepressant potential
    of fisetin and its mechanisms were investigated in a recently published study.,
  'Data obtained from two mouse models employing despair tests suggested that fisetin
    dose-dependently inhibited the immobility time in both behavioral tests, while
    the doses that affected the immobile response did not affect locomotor activity.',
  'To discover the possible effect of fisetin in the noradrenergic and serotonergic
    systems, two behavioral models, reserpine-induced hypothermia and ptosis, in addition
    to p-chlorophenylalanine-induced depletion of serotonin, were used as indicators.',
  'The higher dose of fisetin antagonized the hypothermia induced by reserpine and
    produced an increase in serotonin and noradrenaline levels in the frontal cortex
    and hippocampus, showing that the antidepressant-like effect of fisetin was due
    to its regulatory effect on central serotonin and noradrenaline levels.', 'Navigate

    Shia et al.', have investigated the metabolism and pharmacokinetics of fisetin
    in rats., 'The activities of fisetin and its serum metabolites against 2,2-azobis  -induced
    hemolysis were evaluated and compared on an equimolar basis.', 'After intravenous
    administration of fisetin, the mean serum concentrationtime profiles of metabolites
    showed that fisetin declined rapidly.', 'The sulfates/glucuronides and glucuronides
    were largely at higher concentrations than the parent compounds at all time points,
    suggesting that fisetin was rapidly and extensively biotransformed by conjugation
    metabolism in the liver, mainly sulfation.', 'Following oral dose, fisetin levels
    were maintained after the first pass through the intestine and liver as shown
    by presence of the parent compound in serum.', 'The 0-2880 of fisetin sulfates/glucuronides
    was 2.2-fold that of fisetin glucuronides, demonstrating that fisetin was rapidly
    and extensively metabolized to sulfates and glucuronides.', 'Interestingly, it
    was observed that less sulfation occurred in enterocytes than in hepatocytes when
    serum levels of metabolites were compared after intravenous dose.', 'It was shown
    that after treatment of 50 mg/kg body weight of fisetin, Cmax and AUC0-2880 values
    of fisetin sulfate/glucuronide were 27-fold and 59-fold greater than the Cmax
    and AUC0-4320 values of 5-OH-flavone sulfate/glucuronide, respectively, following
    40 mg/kg body weight of 5-OH-flavone.', 'After an equal dose, the AUC0-4320 of
    7-OH-flavone sulfate/glucuronide was found to be even lower than that of 5-OH-flavone
    sulfate/glucuronide.', 'There was significant inhibition of AAPH-induced hemolysis
    by both fisetin and its serum metabolites, signifying that fisetin sulfates/glucuronides
    retain free-radical scavenging activity due to the presence of residual phenolic
    groups after conjugation metabolism.', 'It has been reported that the maximum
    fisetin concentration reached 2.5 g/ml at 15 min, and the plasma concentration
    declined biphasically with a rapid half-life of 0.09 h and a terminal half-life
    of 3.1 h after administration of fisetin at a dose of 223 mg/kg intraperitoneally
    in mice.', These studies clearly demonstrate that the metabolism of fisetin has
    a significant role in its biological responses and anticancer activities., Ragelle
    et al., conducted a study to incorporate fisetin into a nanoemulsion to improve
    its pharmacokinetics and therapeutic efficacy., 'It has been shown that the fisetin
    nanoemulsion injected intravenously showed no significant difference in systemic
    exposure compared to free fisetin in mice, but when given intraperitoneally as
    compared to free fisetin, a 24-fold increase in the relative bioavailability of
    fisetin was found.', The antitumor activity of the fisetin nanoemulsion in Lewis
    lung carcinoma-bearing mice occurred at lower doses compared to free fisetin.,

    Many botanical antioxidants are considered for health-promoting effects.', 'One
    such antioxidant, fisetin, has recently received some attention for its beneficial
    effects against several diseases.', 'Ischemic stroke is recognized as the multiphasic
    process composed of necrosis and apoptosis evolving into an immune-mediated process,
    leading to further lesion growth.', Compounds capable of affecting these features
    could afford protection against the disease., Fisetin has been reported to reduce
    ischemia-induced brain damage., Additional studies are required to establish the
    neuroprotective properties of fisetin and to understand the precise molecular
    mechanisms involved in the animal models of neurodegenerative diseases., Fisetin
    has also been reported as a potential cancer preventive agent in several types
    of cancer., 'However, in vivo studies are still lacking with this natural compound
    to further establish its role and leading the way for future clinical trials.',
  The investigation of the molecular mechanisms associated with the anticancer effects
    exhibited by fisetin is essential., Further research could lead to the development
    of fisetin as a chemopreventive/chemotherapeutic agent against cancer and other
    diseases., Single-agent-targeted therapies have rarely cured patients with cancer.,
  'Since fisetin exhibits several activities that are potentially beneficial in treating
    cancer, further studies directed toward target identification, and pathway analysis
    could pave the way for the addition of fisetin to the armamentarium of anticancer
    therapy.', 'To translate the chemopreventive potential of fisetin to clinical
    use, well-designed clinical trials along with the development of reliable analytical
    biomarkers are required.', Pharmacokinetics studies will provide additional information
    to understand its effect on cancer in humans., 'To develop fisetin clinically,
    in-depth research studies involving suitable animal models, feasibility of use
    by humans, and optimization of the desired physiological responses in targeted
    patients or healthy populations are required.', 'Navigate ArticleTop of pageAuthor
