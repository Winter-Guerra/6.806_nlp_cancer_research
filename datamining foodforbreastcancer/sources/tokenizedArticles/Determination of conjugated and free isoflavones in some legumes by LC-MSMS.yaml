text: [Some widely consumed legumes could potentially be used as alternatives to soy
    as a source of dietary isoflavones., 'In this study, 6 legumes  were analysed
    to determine their contents for 10 different isoflavones.', Methanolic extracts
    obtained by ultrasound-assisted extraction were analysed by triple quadrupole
    LC-MS/MS., 'Chickpeas were the best source of isoflavones, with a significant
    amount of biochanin A and its conjugated form, sissotrin.', Kidney beans had the
    second highest concentration of isoflavones  and were particularly rich in genistin.,
  'The total isoflavone concentrations of yellow split lentils, green lentils, red
    lentils and haricot beans were each below 200.0 g/kg.', It was determined that
    the legumes commonly consumed in Western diets  are not good alternatives to soy
    and soy products as sources of isoflavones.]
