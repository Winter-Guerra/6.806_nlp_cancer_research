text: ['Our objective was to examine the association between dietary fat intake, cooking
    fat usage, and breast cancer risk in a population-based, multiethnic, case-control
    study conducted in the San Francisco Bay area.', 'Intake of total fat and types
    of fat were assessed with a food frequency questionnaire among 1,703 breast cancer
    cases diagnosed between 1995 and 1999 and 2,045 controls.', 'In addition, preferred
    use of fat for cooking was assessed.', Unconditional logistic regression was used
    to estimate odds ratios  and 95% confidence intervals., High fat intake was associated
    with increased risk of breast cancer  ; 0.01)., A positive association was found
    for oleic acid  &lt; 0.01) but not for linoleic acid or saturated fat., Risk was
    increased for women cooking with hydrogenated fats  or vegetable/corn oil  compared
    to women using olive/canola oil., Our results suggest that a low-fat diet may
    play a role in breast cancer prevention., We speculate that monounsaturated trans
    fats may have driven the discrepant associations between types of fat and breast
    cancer.]
