text: ['Background: There is an increased interest in alternative treatments that
    reduce the toxicity of chemotherapy by lowering the drug concentration, whilst
    maintaining potency against cancer cells.', 'Previous studies have demonstrated
    that arabinoxylan from rice bran, MGN-3/Biobran, sensitizes human breast cancer
    cells  to daunorubicin.', 'In the present study, we further evaluated the ability
    of MGN-3 to sensitize cells to another chemotherapy agent, paclitaxel.', 'Materials
    and Methods: Non-metastatic MCF-7  and metastatic 4T1  cells were cultured with
    different concentrations of paclitaxel in the presence or absence of MGN-3.',
  'Cell survival, DNA damage, and cell proliferation were examined.', 'Results: MGN-3
    increased the susceptibility of both types of cancer cells to paclitaxel by over
    100-fold.', 'Mechanistically, MGN-3 works synergistically with paclitaxel by causing
    DNA damage, enhancing apoptosis, and inhibiting cell proliferation in 4T1 cells.',
  'Conclusion: Our data demonstrate that MGN-3 is an effective chemosensitizer and
    may represent a novel adjuvant for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer.',
  'Cancer remains the largest cause of mortality in the world, claiming over six million
    lives each year.', Chemotherapy is considered the cornerstone of treatment for
    many types of cancers., 'However, many chemotherapeutic agents exhibit dose-limiting
    toxicities.', 'Therefore, there is increasing interest in identifying compounds
    that may increase the sensitivity of cancer cells to conventional chemotherapeutic
    agents, thus reducing chemotherapeutic-related toxicity.', 'Early studies from
    our laboratory have shown that arabinoxylan rice bran, MGN-3/Biobran, sensitizes
    human leukemia HUT 78 cells to apoptosis induced by antibody to cluster of differentiation
    95, and human breast cancer cells  to daunorubicin in vitro.', Further studies
    have revealed the synergistic effect of MGN-3 with transarterial oily chemoembolization
    in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma., 'In the present study, we thought
    it would be of particular interest to further investigate the chemosensitizing
    ability of MGN-3 towards another chemotherapeutic agent, paclitaxel, commonly
    known as taxol.', 'Several rice bran products have been examined for their role
    as antitumor agents, including polysaccharide RBS, lipoprotein fraction, and agglutinin.',
  'In addition, a recent study showed that rice  inhibits the growth of human leukemia
    U937 cells through activation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells.', MGN-3 is
    a natural product that is obtained by reacting rice bran hemicellulose with multiple
    carbohydrate-hydrolyzing enzymes from Shiitake mushrooms., The main chemical component
    of MGN-3 is arabinoxylan with a xylose in its main chain and an arabinose polymer
    in its side chain., We presented evidence elsewhere for the role of MGN-3 as a
    potent biological response modifier of human natural killer  cells., 'It also
    activates human dendritic cells, enhances the proliferation of T-cells and B-cells,
    and augments the phagocytic function of macrophages.', 'In addition, further studies
    revealed that administration of MGN-3 to tumor-bearing mice resulted in significant
    reduction in tumor volume.', 'Based on our earlier findings, we initiated this
    study to further investigate the chemosensitizing ability of MGN-3 towards another
    chemotherapeutic agent, paclitaxel, in metastatic breast cancer cells and to elucidate
    its mode of action.', Drugs and chemicals., 'Paclitaxel was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich,
    Inc.. RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 3--2,5-diphenyltetrazoliumbromide  from
    Sigma-Aldrich.', MGN-3 alone reduces the survival rate of MCF-7 cells., 'Using
    MTT assay method, MCF-7 cells were incubated with MGN-3  for 24 and 48 h. The
    half-maximal inhibitory concentration  is indicated by arrows.', MGN-3 was provided
    by Daiwa Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd.  and was dissolved in complete medium  at a concentration
    of 30 mg/ml., Tumor cell lines and culture conditions., 'The human BCC line MCF-7
    and murine 4T1 cells BCC, which metastasize to the lung was used in the present
    study.', Cells were purchased from the American Tissue and Culture Collection.,
  'Tumor cells were maintained in our laboratory in a CM that consisted of RPMI-1640,
    supplemented with 10% FCS, 2 mM glutamine, and 100 g/ml streptomycin and penicillin.',
  Effect of chemotherapy plus MGN-3 on growth of breast cancer cells., drug sensitivity
    assay., Drug sensitivity was determined by using a colorimetric MTT assay., Cancer
    cells  were seeded in 96-well plates and cultured in triplicate in the presence
    or absence of different concentrations of MGN-3  and in the presence or absence
    of selected concentrations of paclitaxel., 'The final volume of medium in each
    well after the addition of MGN-3 or paclitaxel was 200 l. The cultures were incubated
    at 37C for 24 and 48 h after which 50 mg of MTT were added to each well and the
    cultures were incubated for an additional 4 h. The plates were then centrifuged,
    the medium was carefully removed, the formazan crystals solubilized with acid
    alcohol and the plates were read at 590 nm using an ELISA plate reader.', The
    50% inhibitory concentration  was determined as the drug concentration resulting
    in a 50% reduction of cell viability., The IC50 was determined by plotting the
    logarithm of the drug concentration versus the survival rate of the treated cells.,
  Trypan blue exclusion method., 'In sterile test tubes, the cells and chemicals were
    added with different concentrations of MGN-3, paclitaxel, and both MGN-3 plus
    paclitaxel in triplicates.', Cells were incubated for 24 and 48 h at 37C in a
    humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in sterile medium., Viable cells were counted
    by trypan blue exclusion using hemocytometer., Then the percentage of live cells
    was obtained by dividing the viable cells by the total number cells., All experiments
    were repeated in triplicates., Co-culture of MGN-3 sensitized MCF-7 cells to paclitaxel
    causing an even greater decrease in cell survival., MCF-7 cells were co-cultured
    with different concentrations of MGN-3 and paclitaxel for 24 h  and 48 h. The
    half-maximal inhibitory concentration  for each combination is indicated with
    arrows., MGN-3 alone reduces the survival rate of 4T1 cells., 'Using MTT assay
    method, 4T1 cells were incubated with MGN-3  for 24 and 48 h. The half-maximal
    inhibitory concentration  is indicated by arrows.', Co-culture of MGN-3 sensitized
    4T1 cells to paclitaxel causing an even greater decrease in cell survival., 4T1
    cells were co-cultured with varying concentrations of MGN-3 and paclitaxel for  24
    h and  48 h. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration  for each concentration
    combination is indicated with arrows., DNA damage to 4T1 cells., 'The effect of
    paclitaxel, and MGN-3  and paclitaxel plus MGN-3 on DNA damage to 4T1 cells was
    examined.', DNA damage in 4T1 cells was assessed using flow cytometry., Data represent
    the meanSD of experiments performed in triplicate., p;0.01 as compared with control
    untreated 4T1 cells., Proliferation of 4T1 cells., 'The effect of paclitaxel alone,
    and in combination with MGN-3  on the proliferation of 4T1 cells was examined.',
  The percentage proliferation of 4T1 cells was assessed using flow cytometry., Data
    represent the meanSD of experiments performed in triplicate., '#p&lt;0.05, p&lt;0.01
    as compared with control untreated 4T1 cells.', Apoptosis of 4T1 cells., 'The
    effect of paclitaxel alone, and MGN-3 alone  and paclitaxel plus MGN-3 on apoptosis
    of 4T1 cells at 24 and 48 h was examined.', The percentage of apoptosis of 4T1
    cells was assessed using flow cytometry., Data represent the meanSD of experiments
    performed in triplicate., 'p&lt;0.05, #p&lt;0.01 level as compared with control
    untreated 4T1 cells.', 'Flow cytometric analysis for apoptosis, DNA damage and
    cell proliferation.', 'Quantitative detection of apoptosis, DNA damage, and cell
    proliferation in 4T1 cells treated with MGN-3 with and without paclitaxel was
    simultaneously determined by multicolor flow cytometric analysis using the Apoptosis,
    DNA Damage and Cell Proliferation Kit specific for incorporated bromodeoxyuridine,
    phosphorylated H2AX  and cleaved poly ADP ribose polymerase.', 'Following the
    manufacturers instructions, cells were cultured in a CM or with different concentrations
    of MGN-3  with and without paclitaxel  for 24 or 48 h. Ten microliters of BrdU
    working solution  was added to each milliliter of tissue culture medium, following
    this, the cells were incubated for 30 min on ice.', 'Cells were washed by adding
    1 ml of staining buffer/tube and centrifuged  at 250 g, and the supernatant was
    discarded.', 'Cells were fixed with 100 l of BD Cytofix/Cytoperm Fixation/Permeabilization
    Solution per tube, and incubated for 30 min at room temperature.', 'Afterwards,
    cells were washed with 1 ml of 1 BD Perm/Wash Buffer, centrifuged, and the supernatant
    was discarded.', 'Cells were incubated in 100 l of BD Cytofix/Cytoperm Plus Permeabilization
    Buffer/ tube for 10 min in ice, washed, and then re-fixed for 5 min.', One hundred
    microliters of diluted DNase were added to cells which were incubated for 1 h
    at 37C and then washed., 'Cells were resuspended with 20 l wash buffer plus PerCP-Cy5.5
    mouse anti-BrdU, Alexa Fluor 647 mouse anti-H2AX, PE anti-cleaved PARP   for 20
    min in the dark and then washed.', Cells were resuspended in staining buffer for
    analysis by fluorescence-activated cell sorting  using CellQuest 3.3 software.,
  Statistical analysis., Values are reported as the meanSD and data were analyzed
    using one way analysis of variance followed by post hoc tests for multiples comparisons.,
  A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant., Effects of
    MGN-3 alone on MCF-7 cell survival., The effect of MGN-3 alone on MCF-7 cell survival
    was examined at 24 and 48 h post-culture of cancer cells with MGN-3., Data using
    the MTT assay are depicted in Figure 1 and show that treatment with MGN-3 resulted
    in a decrease in the percentage of viable cancer cells at 24 h. The IC50 value
    was 1000 g/ml., 'The cytotoxic effect became more remarkable at 48 h, where the
    IC50 value was approximately 800 g/ml.', Similar results were noted by the trypan
    blue assay., Effects of MGN-3 on the sensitivity of MCF-7 to paclitaxel., Data
    of MTT assay in Figure 2 show that the survival of MCF-7 cells was inhibited post-culture
    with paclitaxel., 'On the other hand, co-culture of cells with MGN-3 plus paclitaxel
    caused a more marked reduction than paclitaxel alone.', The sensitizing effect
    of MGN-3 follows a dose-dependent pattern., 'At 24 h, the paclitaxel IC50 value
    decreased by a factor of over 100 at MGN-3 concentrations of 600, 750, and 1000
    g/ml, as compared with paclitaxel alone.', Further reduction of IC50 can be seen
    at 48 h. Similar results were noted by trypan blue assay., Effects of MGN-3 alone
    on 4T1 cell survival., Data in Figure 3 showed that MGN-3 reduced 4T1 cell survival
    in a dose-dependent fashion as examined by MTT assay., 'We noted a remarkable
    cytotoxic effect by MGN-3 at 24 h: the IC50 was approximately 700 g/ml.', 'At
    48 h post-culture of 4T1 cells with MGN-3, the IC50 value further decreased to
    approximately 580 g/ml.', Similar trends were observed using the trypan blue assay.,
  Effects of MGN-3 on the sensitivity of 4T1 cells to paclitaxel., 'The survival of
    4T1 cells post-culture with paclitaxel alone was inhibited; however, further inhibition
    was noticed post-culture with MGN-3-plus-paclitaxel.', The sensitizing effect
    of MGN-3 follows a dose-dependent pattern., 'Data in Figure 4A shows that at 24
    h, the IC50 value for paclitaxel decreased by a factor of approximately 3 at an
    MGN-3 concentration of 600 g/ml, up to a factor of approximately 100 at an MGN-3
    concentration of 1000 g/ml, as compared with paclitaxel alone.', More marked cytotoxic
    effects of the co-treatment can be seen at 48 h. Results were further confirmed
    by trypan blue assay., Differential sensitivity of 4T1 and MCF-7 cells to paclitaxel
    with and without MGN-3., We compared the sensitivity of the non-metastatic MCF-7
    and metastatic 4T1 cells to paclitaxel with and without MGN-3., 'The results showed
    that 4T1 cells are more sensitive than MCF-7 cells to the toxicity of paclitaxel
    both alone and in combination with MGN-3, as indicated by the cell survival at
    24 and 48 h using the MTT assay.', 'Exposure of both cancer cell types to paclitaxel
    alone and in combination with MGN-3 shows the IC50 for 4T1 cells to be lower than
    those of MCF-7 cells at 24 and 48 h. Investigation of DNA damage, cell proliferation,
    and apoptosis were, therefore, carried out using 4T1 cells alone to elucidate
    the mechanisms of action of MGN-3.', DNA damage of 4T1 cells., The effect of MGN-3  and
    paclitaxel  on percentage of DNA damage of 4T1 cells was examined., Data in Figure
    5 show that treatment of 4T1 cells with paclitaxel alone significantly increased
    the percentage of DNA damage  as compared with control untreated 4T1 cells., A
    similar pattern was observed on treatment of 4T1 cells with MGN-3 alone  as compared
    with control untreated 4T1 cells., 'On the other hand, exposure of 4T1 cells to
    both paclitaxel plus MGN-3 resulted in a marked increase in the percentage of
    DNA damage that was higher than that with either agent alone.', "The chemosensitizing
    effect of MGN-3 was significant at 24 h and was further increased at 48 h. \n\nProliferation
    of 4T1 cells.", Figure 6 shows the effect of MGN-3  and paclitaxel  on the percentage
    of 4T1 cell proliferation., Treatment of 4T1 cells with paclitaxel resulted in
    inhibition of cell proliferation at 24 h which further decreased at 48 h  as compared
    with control untreated 4T1 cells., 'Similarly, 4T1 cell proliferation decreased
    upon exposure to MGN-3 alone at concentration of 500 g/ml  and 600 g/ml  24 and
    48 h as compared with control untreated 4T1 cells.', 'However, co-culture of 4T1
    cells in the presence MGN-3 and paclitaxel showed that the inhibition of cell
    proliferation was greater than that with either agent alone.', Apoptosis of 4T1
    cells., The effect of MGN-3 at concentrations of 500 and 600 g/ml and paclitaxel  on
    the percentage of 4T1 cell apoptosis was examined., 'Data in Figure 7 show that
    treatment of 4T1 cells with paclitaxel alone increased 4T1 cell apoptosis at 24
    h  and further increased it at 48 h. In a dose-dependent manner, MGN-3 significantly
    enhanced apoptosis of 4T1 cells.', 'However, exposure of 4T1 cells to MGN-3 plus
    paclitaxel resulted in a higher percentage of 4T1 cell apoptosis than that with
    either agent alone.', 'Paclitaxel, a natural product from Yew trees, is considered
    to be a very powerful chemotherapeutic drug for the treatment of a number of cancer
    types, such as those of breast, ovary and prostate, and esophageal, non-small
    cell lung carcinoma, and melanoma.', The apoptotic effect of paclitaxel on cells
    has been shown to be dose-dependent  and low concentrations  can induce apoptosis
    in anaplastic thyroid cancer  cells in vitro., 'However, a higher concentration
    is required to induce an apoptotic effect on cancer in clinical practice.', 'Such
    a high dose of paclitaxel is associated with severe side-effects including neutropenia,
    neuralgia and gastrointestinal toxicity.', 'Thus, investigations that would allow
    choosing an optimal concentration of paclitaxel that causes death of cancer cells
    yet resulting in minimal damage to normal tissue, are urgently required.', Data
    of this study indicate the potential of MGN-3 in reducing the chemotoxic effects
    of paclitaxel via reducing the concentration required for killing cancer cells.,
  The IC50 value for paclitaxel was reduced by over 100-fold for both MCF-7 and 4T1
    cells in the presence of MGN-3., 'MGN-3 has the ability to sensitize cancer cells
    to other types of chemotherapy, such as DNR.', 'Furthermore, in animal studies,
    MGN-3 has beneficial effects by protecting against severe weight loss due to cisplatin.',
  'This protection was demonstrated in some gross gastrointestinal pathological changes,
    as well as in the prevention of death induced by chemotherapy.', 'In addition,
    results of clinical trials on hepatocellular carcinoma and other types of progressive
    cancers have shown that chemotherapy treatment in the presence of MGN-3 resulted
    in a higher survival rate, a lower percentage of recurrence and a marked improvement
    in appetite as compared with chemotherapy alone.', We previously showed the mechanism
    by which MGN-3 induces its daunorubicin-sensitizing effect involves the ability
    of MGN-3 to increase the accumulation of this chemotherapy in human BCCs., 'Results
    of the current study showed that MGN-3 synergizes with paclitaxel in causing greater
    DNA damage in 4T1 cells, enhancing their apoptosis and inhibiting their proliferation.',
  The combined effects of both paclitaxel and MGN-3 were higher than that of either
    treatment alone., 'Several agents enhance the cytotoxic effect of chemotherapeutics
    in cancer cells via increasing intracellular drug accumulation and reversing multidrug
    resistance  in cancer cells, including the calcium channel blocker diltiazem and
    the biscoclaurine alkaloid cepharanthine, anti-arrhythmic agent quinidine, and
    synthetic isothiocyanate derivative E-4IB.', 'In addition, nutritional intervention
    toward tumor responsiveness to chemotherapy has been examined.', Omega-3 polyunsaturated
    fatty acids have been used to increase intracellular drug accumulation in cancer
    cells., 'Furthermore, our earlier study showed that MGN-3 reverses MDR in HL60/AR
    cells.', Research over the past two decades has revealed that many anticancer
    drugs function by inducing apoptosis., We have examined the role of MGN-3 in caspase
    activation., 'Treatment with MGN-3 resulted in an increase in the number of human
    BCCs with active caspase-8, and -9 in MCF-7 cells and -3,-8, and -9 in HCC70 cells,
    in addition, the sensitizing effect of MGN-3 on human leukemia HUT 78 cells to
    CD95 antibody-induced apoptosis, was correlated with an increased number of cells
    with active caspase-3, -8, and -9.', This suggests that MGN-3 sensitizes cancer
    cells to daunorubicin by a mechanism that involves caspase cascades., 'Similar
    findings were reported by Bodo et al., whereby increased intracellular platinum
    accumulation post-treatment with a synthetic isothiocyanate derivative E-4IB,
    was accompanied by the stimulation of caspase-3 activity.', 'In this study, we
    observed that 4T1 cells treated with paclitaxel exhibited DNA damage that was
    associated with an inhibition of cell proliferation.', 'This effect may be due
    to the ability of paclitaxel to bind to microtubules, thus preventing cell proliferation.',
  Paclitaxel induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in most types of cancer cells.,
  The promise of anticancer activity by rice and rice bran derivatives has been the
    focus of many studies., 'MGN-3 is an arabinoxylan extracted from rice bran  and
    possesses immunomodulatory function for different immune cells, such as dendritic
    cells, NK, T- and B-cells and macrophages, and increases the production of cytokines
    such as tumor necrotic factor- and interferon-.', 'In addition, MGN-3 has demonstrated
    characteristics as a novel antitumor agent able to sensitize human leukemia cells
    to death receptor -induced apoptosis, yeast-induced apoptosis of cancer cells,
    and human BCCs to daunorubicin.', 'Moreover, the results of this study showed
    that MGN-3 exerts a paclitaxel-sensitizing effect on metastatic 4T1 cells.', 'These
    data may suggest that the food supplementation of MGN-3, in conjunction with paclitaxel
    chemotherapy may be useful for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer.', 'The
    Authors would like to acknowledge Daiwa Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan,
    for the financial support of this project.']
