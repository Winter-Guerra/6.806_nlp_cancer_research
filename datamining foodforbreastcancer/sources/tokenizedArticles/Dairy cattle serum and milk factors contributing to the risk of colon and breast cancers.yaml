text: [The analysis of published epidemiological data on colon and breast cancer reveals
    a remarkable concordance for most regions of the world., A low incidence for both
    cancers has been recorded in Mongolia and Bolivia., 'Discrepant data, however,
    have been reported for India, Japan and Korea.', 'In India, the incidence of breast
    cancer is significantly higher than for colon cancer, in Japan and Korea colon
    cancer exceeds by far the rate of breast cancer.', 'Here, studies are summarized
    pointing to a species-specific risk for colon cancer after consumption of beef
    originating from dairy cattle.', 'Uptake of dairy products of Bos taurus-derived
    milk cattle, particularly consumed at early age, is suggested to represent one
    of the main risk factors for the development of breast cancer.', A recent demonstration
    of reduced breast cancer rates in individuals with lactose intolerance  seems
    to be in line with this interpretation., Species-specific risk factors for these
    cancers are compatible with the transmission of different infectious factors transferred
    via meat or dairy products., Countries with discordant rates of colon and breast
    cancer reveal a similar discordance between meat and milk product consumption
    of dairy cattle., 'The recent isolation of a larger number of novel presumably
    viral DNAs from serum, meat and dairy products of healthy dairy cows, at least
    part of them infectious for human cells, deserves further investigation.', 'Systemic
    infections early in life, resulting in latency and prevention of subsequent infections
    with the same agent by neutralizing antibodies, would require reconsideration
    of ongoing prospective studies conducted in the adult population.', Several virus
    infections are characterized by a remarkable adaptation for replication in specific
    species only., 'Human pathogenic papilloma-, polyoma- and gamma-herpesviruses
    for example seem to be restricted for their replication to infection of human
    cells, although related species-specific virus types have been isolated from a
    number of animals, also including cattle.', 'Experimental transmission of specific
    human viruses to rodents, such as the polyomaviruses BK and JC or human adenovirus
    types 12, 18 and 31, results in efficient tumor induction upon inoculation into
    newborn animals.', 'The same agents replicate in specific human cells, but fail
    to do so in animals in which they may induce malignant growth.', 'Thus far, no
    examples are available establishing their carcinogenicity for the permissive human
    system.', Cancer induction by these agents seems to be linked to conditions of
    replicative incompetence., 'High risk human papillomavirus  types 16 and 18, as
    well as Epstein-Barr virus do not follow the same pattern, since as human pathogens
    they are linked to certain cancers in humans.', 'In view of their wide-spread
    distribution in human populations, however, human cancers linked to these infections
    are relatively rare events and seem to require in virtually all cases additional
    modifications of host cell genes.', 'In case of HPV infections genetic or epigenetic
    modifications of the viral genome regularly occur, rendering the carcinogenic
    viral genomes replication-incompetent.', 'Genetic studies indicate that most of
    these agents produce latent infections since the early days of human evolution,
    resulting, in case of HPV infections, in a balanced state between survival of
    basal layer cells and viral replication.', The latter often takes place solely
    in differentiated cells no longer capable to divide., 'For these reasons it remains
    an interesting question whether animals living in close proximity to humans acquire
    analogous infections, persisting in part for lifetime in their respective host
    with intermittent replication and excretion, without causing symptoms of disease.',
  'Their transmission to species in which they are replication-incompetent, but where
    they may still express early growth-stimulating genes, could result in malignant
    cell transformation.', 'Reasoning along these lines stimulated analyses of the
    geographic epidemiology of human cancers published in, to find hints for a possible
    involvement of infectious agents.', "Since the result suggested a potential risk
    of red meat and specifically of beef consumption, we analysed the following questions:
    \n\nIn a previous publication reasons have been outlined for linking the increased
    risk of colorectal polyps and colorectal cancer to long-time consumption of red
    meat, specifically to beef uptake.", Since then additional studies have been published
    supporting the suspicion of a specific risk for colon and breast cancer after
    long-time consumption of beef or dairy products from Aurochs-derived Taurine cattle  in
    contrast to Zebu cattle., A shared early phase of evolution of humped  cattle
    revealed an estimated divergence time of the Taurine and Indicine subspecies of
    610.000 - 850.000 years ago., 'It has frequently been suggested that the risk
    for colon cancer originates from long-time consumption of grilled, barbecued,
    roasted or fried meat, leading to the formation of aromatic hydrocarbons and a
    few other defined carcinogens, as initially noted by Sugimura and coworkers.',
  It has previously been pointed out that major inconsistencies in these observations
    originated from publications demonstrating the same chemical carcinogens in chicken
    or fish after preparation in a similar way and consuming it for prolonged periods
    of time., Long-time fish consumption even seems to have a protective effect for
    colorectal cancer development and increased risks for colorectal polyps were also
    not consistently noted after long-time poultry consumption., These reports prompted
    careful analyses of data from countries with a low risk for colorectal cancer.,
  'Three countries are most striking: India, Mongolia and Bolivia.', Figure 1\., Global
    pattern of colorectal cancer incidence in females., The arrows indicate low incidence
    countries., The intensity of the color corresponds to high incidence rates., Reproduced
    from Ref., '9, with permission of IARC, Lyon.', 'In India, the risk for colon
    cancer is exceptionally low.', The Hindu population does not consume beef., 'The
    vast majority of cattle in India are Zebus, which are better adapted to tropical
    climates than Taurins.', 'The latter are kept, however, on specific farms in India
    and responsible for a remarkable increase in the availability of dairy products,
    documented since the 1990th.', 'Exceptional are a few states, among them Kerala,
    where beef is more consumed than in most other parts of India and where beef consumption
    has been identified as a major risk factor for colorectal cancer.', Approximately
    82% of cattle in Kerala originate from cross-breeding between Swiss and native  cattle
    to improve milk production., 'Other states with an increased risk for colon cancer
    are Arunanchal Pradesh, Nagaland and Sikkim in the North-Eastern part of the country
    where the consumption of air-dried and smoked beef became popular.', These states
    harbor a heterogeneous human population of tribes largely of Tibeto-Burman/Mongoloid
    origin and more closely related to Southeast Asia than to South Asia., 'In general,
    in spite of the majority of the Hindu population rejecting beef, the rate of colon
    cancer is slightly higher in some of the densely populated urban regions, possibly
    due to migration of different ethnic and religious groups into urban centres.',
  'Interestingly, all over India the rate of rectal cancer seems to exceed that of
    colon cancer, pointing to different etiological factors involved in these cancers.',
  'In Mongolia, the situation appears to be even more interesting: the rate of colon,
    but also breast cancer is exceptionally low, despite a high consumption of red
    meat and of air-dried meat by the population.', 'According to published studies,
    red meat here originates from sheep and goat, horse, camel  and to 40-50% from
    beef.', 'Approximately 20% of the total cattle population are Yaks, an indigenous
    species of cattle.', About 2.2% of cattle are hybrids with Zebu and Taurine genetic
    admixture., Only Yaks are well adapted to the low winter temperatures in Mongolia.,
  The remaining cattle were up to 1950 a distinct sub-species of Taurines., 'These
    native cattle in Mongolia differ from European/Asian Aurochs-derived dairy cattle,
    the latter being also much less adapted to sustain harsh winter temperatures.',
  'Genetic differences can be seen in the mtDNA haplogroups: of the five mtDNA haplogroups
    T4 is unique to the original Mongolian breeds.', During the second half of the
    last century increasing cross-breeding with Zebus and Chinese Yellow cattle  took
    place., Cattle as a group supplies 40% of the meat and 80% of the milk products.,
  Yaks contribute to 20% of meat from cattle and to 33% of butter., 'In Mongolia,
    incidence of colon cancer remains low and reaches approximately the same level
    as in India.', 'This is surprising since the population of this country is supposed
    to consume high quantities of meat, commonly grilled  or air-dried.', 'The studies
    in Mongolia support the conclusion that red meat as such does not represent a
    risk factor for colon cancer, but rather support the suspicion that species-specific
    factors should be more important, possibly linked to specific breeds of cattle.',
  Bolivia represents the third country with a remarkably low incidence of colorectal
    cancer., 'The original cattle population, the Creole cattle, had been introduced
    by French settlers, initially from Spain via the Caribbean islands to Bolivia
    during the 17th and 18th century.', 'Imports of Zebu cattle increased in the beginning
    of the 19th century, originating mainly from Senegal.', During the 20th century
    the African Zebus were increasingly replaced by Indian Zebus., 'Today Bolivian
    cattle reveals a high preponderance of Zebu genes, by maintaining in part the
    maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA, the latter pointing to the African and
    Iberian origin of the maternal lines.', 'Other interesting observations have been
    reported from Japan and Korea, where the rate of colorectal cancer dramatically
    increased 20 years after the Second World War and 20 years after the Korean War.',
  This correlated with an increase in meat imports and per capita meat consumption
    reflecting the same time interval., 'In both countries, the consumption of either
    rare or completely raw beef  became very popular.', A similar tendency has more
    recently been observed in other South-East Asian States., 'Taken together, it
    becomes obvious that beef consumption as risk factor for colon cancer cannot be
    linked to every cattle species.', Consumption of Zebu and Yak meat and meat from
    cattle with a significant Zebu gene admixture seems to substantially reduce the
    risk for colon cancer development., 'These observations are further underlined
    by genetic analyses from cattle originating from regions with low colorectal cancer
    risks from equatorial Africa or Bolivia, revealing a high preponderance of Zebu
    genes.', Dairy cattle  are most prevalent in all regions with a high risk for
    colon cancer., These observations prompted the working hypothesis that the Eurasian
    types of cattle  are likely candidates to carry and transmit a factor which may
    be involved in colon cancer etiology., 'This factor may represent a species-specific
    infectious agent, probably a virus, being replication-deficient in human cells.',
  'Due to the selective expression of growth-stimulating genes, triggered by acquired
    or inherited genetic modifications, it should contribute to malignant conversion
    of colon cells.', 'The geographic epidemiology suggests a correlation of colon
    cancer incidence with Bos taurus-derived dairy cattle distribution, in contrast
    to Yaks  and probably also Zebus.', The latter two should be more or less refractory
    to this infection., 'As outlined before, this resulted in the postulate that red
    meat of aurochs-derived Eurasian type of dairy cattle should contain infectious
    factors contributing to the peculiar epidemiological pattern of colon cancer.',
  'Although such factor have not yet been identified, 10 novel single-stranded circular
    DNAs have recently been isolated from healthy dairy cattle sera.', The same or
    closely related molecules were also found in commercially available milk., Preliminary
    data indicate their successful replication of human cells., 'Since all of them
    seem to persist as episomes, they may represent interesting candidates for further
    investigations.', 'Their presence in sera almost certainly indicates their persistence
    in red meat, which invariably contains blood.', 'In addition, one other group
    recently described the presence of two parvovirus types, one anellovirus, a circovirus-like
    agent and a novel bovine polyomavirus  in beef purchased from stores in San Francisco.',
  'In this respect a possible link of such or similar infections with inflammatory
    bowel diseases, including ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease, should also deserve
    further studies.', They share some epidemiological incidence patterns with colon
    cancer., Human breast cancer globally reveals an incidence pattern remarkably
    similar to that of colon cancer., 'This accounts in particular for high risk regions,
    like North America, Argentina, most European countries and Australia and is also
    evident for specific low risk countries, like Mongolia, Bolivia and India.', 'On
    a first glance this could suggest common risk factors, such as the frequently
    cited Western Diet.', 'Yet, a few interesting differences have been noted.', 'Although
    India still reveals a relatively low rate of breast cancer, it exceeds, however,
    the rate of colon cancer.', 'This is remarkably different in Japan and Korea,
    where colon cancer incidence steeply increased 20 years after World War II and
    about 20 years after the Korean War, exceeding the slight increase in incidence
    of breast cancer during the same period.', 'Between the years 1975 and 2005, the
    incidence of breast cancer in India increased by almost 70%.', During the same
    period colorectal cancer remained 4-5 times lower., Figure 2\., Global incidence
    of breast cancer., 'The arrows point to regions of low incidence (Mongolia, Bolivia,
    India and equatorial Africa.', The color intensity corresponds to high incidence
    rates., Reproduced from Ref., '9, with permission of IARC, Lyon.', Figure 3\.,
  Comparison of colorectal and breast cancer incidence in selected countries., 'Note
    the difference in incidence of both cancers for Japan, Koreas and India.', Reproduced
    from Ref., '41, with permission of IARC, Lyon.', 'The consumption of beef is unlikely
    to account for the difference in the epidemiological pattern of colon and breast
    cancer in India, because the resident Hindu population does not consume beef.',
  'It is, however, of interest to analyse the dairy product consumption within this
    time span in India.', It increased 2.4 times from 1991 to 2011., 'Within the same
    time span, per capita milk availability increased by about 60%, from 178 to 290
    gm/day.', According to Mayuri et al., milk and dairy products are an important
    part of Indian diet and its consumption starts at an early age., The children
    are commonly initiated to consume bovine milk after 3 months of age., 'Mongolia
    has a relatively low incidence of both, breast and colon cancer, although the
    former exceeds the colon cancer rate by a factor of three.', 'Between 1998 and
    2005 a slight increase has been noted, affecting specifically the urban, but not
    the rural population.', Figure 4\., Age standardized  breast cancer incidence
    rates in Mongolia by population density., Reproduced from Ref., '44, with permission
    of Dr. Troisi.', The original Mongolian cattle  and Yak population were very poor
    milk producers and only in recent decades cross-breeding with Zebus and European
    cattle took place., 'In addition, imported dairy products increasingly became
    available, reaching in particular urban regions.', Cow milk production increased
    by about 50% since 1980., Bolivia represents another country with a low rate of
    breast cancer., 'According to Hudson and Hanratty, milk consumption among Bolivians
    is among the lowest in the world.', 'Although some changes may have taken place
    during the past 25 years, this time period is probably too short to have a significant
    effect on the breast cancer rate.', 'Thus, low dairy product consumption might
    be the reason for the relatively low rate of breast cancer in this country.',
  'In this respect, it is of particular interest to analyse the slight increase in
    breast cancer in contrast to the steep increase of colon cancer in Japan and Korea.',
  'Historically, milk and dairy products played a minor role in both countries, although
    in recent years a substantial increase in their consumption has been noted.',
  Figure 5\., Milk consumption  in 2011 in some selected countries., 'This Figure
    has been redrawn from Holstein Farmer, Dairy Consultants, HSBC.', 'Similarly in
    China, a country still with a low breast cancer incidence in 2011, dairy product
    consumption increased significantly since 1990, selectively in urban regions.',
  Figure 6\., Time course of dairy product consumption in China with a remarkable
    difference between rural and urban populations., 'The Figure has been redrawn
    from data obtained from the FAO Corporate Document Pacific Repository, Regional
    Office for Asia and the Pacific.', 'Agricultural Economic Research Institute,
    Chinese Academy of Agriculture Science.', It will be of substantial interest to
    analyse the upcoming rate of breast cancer in China particularly for urban centers
    in comparison to other regions., The emerging scenario points to a parallel discordance
    between countries with discordant rates of colon and breast cancer and discordances
    between meat and milk product consumption of dairy cattle., Further support for
    a role of dairy product factors in breast  cancers originated from a study analyzing
    22.788 individuals with lactose intolerance compared with 69.922 first degree
    relatives  from the Swedish Cancer Registry., 'A significant reduction was noted
    for the risk for breast cancer, but interestingly also for lung cancer, in lactose
    intolerant individuals.', 'Although persons with lactose intolerance are commonly
    able to consume small quantities of dairy products, they are usually recommended
    to avoid such food.', 'Since our group isolated four novel types of circular single-stranded
    DNA from a small number of commercially available milk samples analyzed, the potential
    relationship of milk-borne infectious agents to breast cancer deserves special
    attention.', A reasonable speculation could be that agents present in dairy products
    possess a higher affinity to mammary cells even when transmitted to other species.,
  'Since carcinogenicity of virtually all potentially carcinogenic infectious agents
    requires additional genetic or epigenetic modifications in host cell genes, the
    same may account for latently persisting bovine milk factors.', 'Mutagenic carcinogens,
    methylating events, inherited modifications in specific signalling cascades, other
    infections and hormonal stimulations by estrogen metabolites may in addition contribute
    to these developments later in life.', 'Obviously, the types of presumably single-stranded
    DNA found in commercially available milk samples may not represent the sole candidates
    for a role in breast cancer.', 'Recently, isolated bovine polyomaviruses discovered
    thus far in beef, sold in commercial shops in San Francisco or other viruses may
    also represent interesting agents to be taken into consideration.', 'The postulated
    role of infectious agents, in particular for breast cancer, could have important
    implications for epidemiological studies: an initial systemic infection with a
    putative milk factor, most likely occurring early in life, should result in neutralizing
    antibody formation, preventing systemic spreading of the same agent in subsequent
    infections during the following lifespan.', Epidemiological prospective and case/control
    studies performed during adult life on dietary habits will not provide useful
    data for events which had affected mainly the first years of life., 'Only the
    inclusion of this initial period of life, in particular by analyzing the duration
    of breast-feeding and the role of dairy product consumption in breast cancer,
    will provide useful information and will add to the understanding of potentially
    crucial early events.', This may provide an explanation for the remarkably contradictory
    studies published on the relationship of cow milk consumption and risk for breast
    cancer not including the early periods of life., The suspected role of infectious
    agents in the development of breast cancer is schematically outlined in Figure
    7., Figure 7\., 'Proposed scheme of events in breast cancer development, assuming
    synergistic interactions between latently persisting BMF agents and acquired or
    inherited genetic or epigenetic modifications.', Changes in incidence occurring
    after migration from low incidence regions to high risk regions and vice versa
    could provide further information on the role of dietary habits in colon and breast
    cancer., They could permit some differentiation between genetic and environmental
    factors for the development of these cancers., 'This of course requires a closer
    look at the migrants, either adhering to the lifestyle of the country of origin
    or adapting to dietary customs of the new environment.', 'A number of studies
    analysed the incidence and/or mortality of colon and breast cancer in Indian migrants
    to the United Kingdom, the United States or Singapore.', 'Basically, these studies
    agreed that age-adjusted incidence rates  for breast cancer in Indian immigrants  were
    higher than in Indian residents  but lower than in Western whites.', Similar observations
    have been reported for Japanese and Korean immigrants for breast and colon cancers.,
  'Thus, it appears that predominantly environmental factors determine the risk for
    these cancers.', 'The enhanced risk for both cancers in immigrant populations,
    emigrating at young age and followed up in subsequent generations, is still at
    a reduced rate when compared with the population of the respective host country.',
  This could point to a genetic background., 'It seems, however, to be more likely
    that dietary customs of the country of origin are partially retained and account
    for these differences.', 'Finally, several studies have been published pointing
    to an involvement of red meat consumption in other human cancers.', 'This accounts
    in particular for prostate and pancreatic cancers, although the available epidemiological
    evidence is still far from convincing, Prospective and case-control studies of
    dietary habits of human adults will be of little value in case of infections occurring
    very early in life, as discussed for breast cancer, followed by neutralizing immune
    reactivity for identical subsequent infections.', Only those initiated during
    pregnancy and during early life span of newborn babies are likely to be informative.,
  'In particular, they need to include the consumption of dairy products  in relation
    to the discussed cancers.', The available data do not prove a role of infectious
    agents in colon or breast cancer., 'Other species-specific risk factors may also
    play an important contributing role, although they seem to be less easily reconciled
    with the geographic epidemiological pattern of these two cancers.', 'According
    to the views of these authors, good reasons exist for looking carefully into the
    potential role of species-specific infectious factors detectable in dairy cattle
    meat, serum, milk and dairy products in relation to human colon and breast cancers.',
  'If definitely identified as risk factors, this should have important consequences
    for the prevention of these cancers, the assessment of persons at risk and hopefully
    also for targeted therapeutic approaches.', 'The availability of single-stranded
    DNA agents in cattle sera and milk should provide tools to rigorously prove or
    disprove their potential contribution by either demonstrating their episomal persistence
    in the respective cancer cells, by experimental approaches to clarify their cell-growth
    stimulating potential and by analyzing seroepidemiological to these infections.',
  'Of course, thus far unidentified related or even unrelated infectious agents should
    also deserve attention.']
