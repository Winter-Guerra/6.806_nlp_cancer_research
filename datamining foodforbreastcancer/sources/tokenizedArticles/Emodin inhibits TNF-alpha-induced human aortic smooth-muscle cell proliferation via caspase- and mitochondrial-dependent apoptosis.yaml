text: ['Vascular smooth-muscle cell  proliferation plays a vital role in hypertension,
    atherosclerosis and restenosis.', 'It has been reported that emodin, an active
    component extracted from rhubarb, can stop the growth of cancer cells; however,
    it is not known if emodin exerts similar anti-atherogenic effects in TNF- treated
    human aortic smooth-muscle cells.', 'In this study, emodin treatment showed potent
    inhibitory effects in TNF--induced HASMC proliferation that were associated with
    induced apoptosis, including the cleavage of poly ADP-ribose polymerase.', 'Moreover,
    inhibitors of caspase-3, -8 and -9  efficiently blocked emodin-induced apoptosis
    in TNF- treated HASMC.', 'Therefore, emodin-induced cell death occurred via caspase-dependent
    apoptosis.', 'Emodin treatment resulted in the release of cytochrome c into cytosol
    and a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, as well as a decrease in the expression
    of an anti-apoptotic protein  and an increase in the expression of an a pro-apoptotic
    protein.', 'Emodin-mediated apoptosis was also blocked by a mitochondrial membrane
    depolarization inhibitor, which indicates that emodin-induced apoptosis occurred
    via a mitochondrial pathway.', 'Taken together, the results of this study showed
    that emodin inhibits TNF--induced HASMC proliferation via caspase- and a mitochondrial-dependent
    apoptotic pathway.', 'In addition, these results indicate that emodin has potential
    as an anti-atherosclerosis agent.', J., Cell., Biochem., '105: 70-80, 2008.',
