text: ['Background: Beneficial effects of fish consumption on early cognitive development
    and cardiovascular health have been attributed to the omega-3 fatty acids in fish
    and fish oils, but toxic chemicals in fish may adversely affect these health outcomes.',
  'Risk-benefit assessments of fish consumption have frequently focused on methylmercury
    and omega-3 fatty acids, not persistent pollutants such as polychlorinated biphenyls,
    and none have evaluated Great Lakes fish consumption.', 'Objectives: The risks
    and benefits of fish consumption have been established primarily for marine fish.',
  'Here, we examine whether sufficient data are available to evaluate the risks and
    benefits of eating freshwater fish from the Great Lakes.', 'Methods: We used a
    scoping review to integrate information from multiple state, provincial, and federal
    agency sources regarding the contaminants and omega-3 fatty acids in Great Lakes
    fish and fish consumers, consumption rates and fish consumption advisories, and
    health effects of contaminants and omega-3 fatty acids.', 'Data synthesis: Great
    Lakes fish contain persistent contaminants--many of which have documented adverse
    health effects --that accumulate in humans consuming them.', 'In contrast, data
    are sparse on omega-3 fatty acids in the fish and their consumers.', 'Moreover,
    few studies have documented the social and cultural benefits of Great Lakes fish
    consumption, particularly for subsistence fishers and native communities.', 'At
    this time, federal and state/provincial governments provide fish consumption advisories
    based solely on risk.', 'Conclusions: Our knowledge of Great Lakes fish has critical
    gaps, particularly regarding the benefits of consumption.', 'A risk-benefit analysis
    requires more information than is currently available on the concentration of
    omega-3 fatty acids in Great Lakes fish and their absorption by fish eaters in
    addition to more information on the social, cultural, and health consequences
    of changes in the amount of fish consumed.', 'Keywords: dioxin, fish consumption,
    Great Lakes, methylmercury, omega-3 fatty acids, PCBs, risk assessment


    The relationship between the risks and benefits of fish consumption is complex.',
  'Consumption of fish and fish oils may be beneficial to early cognitive development
    and improve cardiovascular health in adults, but fish can also be an exposure
    route for toxic chemicals such as polychlorinated biphenyls  and methylmercury,
    which confer risks for these same health outcomes  and others.', Recommendations
    and advisories on fish consumption for both mercury and persistent organic pollutants  are
    often conflicting and can be confusing to consumers., 'The U.S. Food and Drug
    Administration  issued consumption advice for mercury in fish, but only for young
    children and women who are or might become pregnant or are nursing.', 'Health
    Canada advises different rates of consumption for the general population, for
    women who are or might become pregnant, for children 5-11 years of age, and for
    children 1-4 years of age.', 'To add to the confusion, the American Heart Association
    advises consumption of at least two fish meals  per week.', 'They recommend fatty
    fish in particular, such as salmon, mackerel, herring, lake trout, sardines, and
    albacore tuna, but acknowledge that some types of fish may contain high levels
    of mercury, PCBs, dioxins, and other environmental contaminants.', 'Fish consumption
    advice has received considerable publicity in the popular press, and this has
    led to changes in consumption patterns.', 'After the dissemination of advice by
    the U.S. FDA in 2001 recommending that women of childbearing age should avoid
    consuming specific long-lived predatory fish high in mercury and limit fish and
    shellfish meals, pregnant women in eastern Massachusetts decreased their total
    fish consumption, resulting in an estimated decline of 17% to 1.4 servings per
    month.', 'A national sample of households suggested that fish consumption by those
    not targeted by the advisory also decreased, although it is not known if the participants
    were aware of the advisory per se.', The health implications of changing a dietary
    protein source from fish to another source that may have less nutritional benefit
    are unclear., 'Fish, meat, poultry, and eggs are important sources of dietary
    protein, but fish generally have higher levels of selenium and omega-3 fatty acids
    and lower levels of saturated fats compared with other foods of animal origin.',
  'The five Great Lakes have abundant fish stocks harvested by native peoples, recreational
    anglers, and commercial fishing enterprises.', More than 160 aboriginal communities
    situated around the Great Lakes Basin have historically depended on local fish
    for a substantial proportion of their diet., Recreational Great Lakes sport fishing
    is a $7 billion annual industry in the United States., 'In addition, lake whitefish,
    lake herring, yellow perch, walleye, chubs, smelt, lake trout, channel catfish,
    and carp all have commercial harvests.', 'In 2000, the commercial harvest of lake
    whitefish was &gt; 21 million pounds, and both the walleye and smelt harvests
    were &gt; 7 million pounds, with a total harvest value of &gt; $44 million.',
  'However, toxic substances related to agriculture, urbanization, industry, and transportation
    have caused a decline in Great Lakes water quality and contamination of Great
    Lakes fish with persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic chemicals.', This has triggered
    recommendations for restrictions on human fish consumption since the 1970s., 'Currently,
    fish consumption advisories exist for some fish in all of the Great Lakes.', 'In
    the United States, the Great Lakes states have developed a uniform fish consumption
    advisory approach that provides information on the amounts of fish that should
    be consumed over a particular period based on contaminant level, size, species,
    and location.', State fish advisories also include a statement recognizing that
    fish consumption has potential health benefits in comparison with other food sources.,
  Advisories for the Canadian Great Lakes vary by lake and are related primarily to
    PCB levels and secondarily to dioxins/furans and mercury levels., 'Ontario has
    also developed a comprehensive fish consumption advisory, which addresses both
    the health risks and benefits of fish consumption.', 'Acknowledging that it is
    not possible to determine quantitatively the risk versus benefit of fish consumption,
    it concludes, consumption of fish with high nutrient and low contaminant levels
    should be favoured.', The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency  has published
    general guidance for fish consumption based on contaminant concentrations., Adherence
    to these guidelines would result in very limited or no consumption of most Great
    Lakes fish., 'While a fair amount of information on contaminant concentrations
    in Great Lakes fish is available, little is known about the omega-3 fatty-acid
    content of these fish, creating significant uncertainty about how to balance the
    risks and benefits of eating Great Lakes fish.', 'Indeed, most of our knowledge
    on the nutritional benefits of fish consumption is based on marine fish, which
    generally have higher concentrations of omega-3 fatty acids than freshwater fish.',
  'Several reviews have focused on the benefits of nutrients and risks from contaminants
    in fish, but none have specifically examined this question with regard to Great
    Lakes fish.', 'The objective of this publication is to review the data on contaminants
    and omega-3 fatty acids in Great Lakes fish, the concentrations of both fatty
    acids and contaminants found in persons who consume Great Lakes fish, and health
    effects of these factors.', This is undertaken with the goal of identifying additional
    information that would be needed to undertake a risk-benefit analysis of Great
    Lakes fish consumption., We used a scoping approach  to contextualize knowledge
    with regard to the risks and benefits of Great Lakes fish consumption., 'The goal
    was not to undertake a systematic review of the literature relating to this topic,
    but rather to summarize a range of evidence from various sources in order to convey
    the breadth and depth of this issue.', 'In a scoping review, a wide range of research
    and nonresearch material is synthesized to provide greater conceptual clarity
    about a topic or field of evidence.', 'We identified relevant peer-reviewed literature,
    as well as government reports from state, federal, and provincial health departments,
    the U.S. EPA, the OMOE, and the International Joint Commission, containing relevant
    information on contaminants and omega-3 fatty acids in Great Lakes fish and fish
    consumers, information about fish consumption rates and fish advisories for Great
    Lakes fish, or information about health effects of contaminants or omega-3 fatty
    acids present in Great Lakes fish.', 'We have included data on fish from the five
    Great Lakes, mouths of rivers feeding into the Great Lakes, and the St. Lawrence
    River.', Historical and current contaminants in Great Lakes fish., 'The Great
    Lakes are contaminated with many bioaccumulative pollutants including PCBs, polychlorinated
    dibenzo dioxins and furans, polybrominated diphenyl ethers, methylmercury, and
    chlorinated pesticides such as dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane  and its metabolites.',
  'Most of these contaminants are lipophilic and therefore are found in higher concentrations
    in fatty, older, and piscivorous fish.', 'Levels of methylmercury are also higher
    in older and predatory fish, but because methylmercury binds to protein, it bioaccumulates
    in muscle tissue rather than fatty tissue.', 'Contaminant levels measured in edible
    portions of a variety of Great Lakes fish are monitored by the OMOE, by the U.S.
    states that border the Great Lakes, and by some tribal nations and are used to
    issue fish consumption advisories.', 'In addition, the U.S. EPA and Environment
    Canada have ongoing, long-term efforts to monitor whole-body contaminant levels
    of top predator fish species  in order to track trends in contaminants over time.',
  'Many of these programs have recently been expanded to include contaminants of emerging
    concern such as PBDEs and other flame retardants, perfluorochemicals, and polychlorinated
    naphthalenes.', 'In general, fish from Lakes Michigan, Ontario, and Huron have
    the highest levels of PCBs, DDT, and dieldrin; fish from Lake Superior have the
    highest levels of toxaphene; and those from Lake Ontario have the highest levels
    of mirex.', 'Contaminant levels are frequently lowest in fish from Lakes Superior
    and Erie and highest in Lakes Michigan and Ontario, presumably because of differences
    in agricultural, municipal, industrial, and airborne sources of contaminants.',
  The higher toxaphene levels found in Lake Superior fish are an exception and due
    to the ability of the cold lake water to absorb this pesticide., Mercury concentrations
    in fish are driven by several factors., 'Historically, chlor-alkali plants were
    point-source mercury discharge sources, but these plants have been closed.', 'Modeling
    techniques, using source-receptor information, reveal that atmospheric mercury,
    mostly from coal-burning plants, is now the primary contributor to Great Lakes
    mercury concentrations.', Whether the conditions in local ecosystems are favorable
    to the methylation process further determines fish mercury concentration., 'Substantial
    decreases in contaminant levels in Great Lakes top predator fish have been noted
    for many chemicals banned in the 1970s and 1980s, including PCBs, DDT, chlorodane,
    toxaphene, aldrin, dieldrin, and mirex, although recent data suggest that contaminant
    levels are now decreasing more slowly or remaining level.', 'As an example, PCB
    concentrations in lake trout have continuously declined since its manufacture
    ceased in the late 1970s, but the decline has slowed since the 1980s.', 'The interlake
    differences, which were 2- to 9-fold in the 1970s and 1980s, are now only 2- to
    4-fold.', 'Similarly, decreasing levels of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin  in
    lake trout from the Canadian Great Lakes have also been reported.', 'Mercury concentrations
    have generally declined over time, with some variation by fish species and lake.',
  'From the 1970s to 2007, mercury levels varied 2- to 3-fold, with highest concentrations
    in Lake Superior and lowest in Lake Erie fish.', 'However, as with other contaminants,
    spatial differences have diminished since 2000.', 'Many factors may be affecting
    trends in contaminant levels, including reductions in external inputs and changes
    in the food web structure as a result of invasive species introduced during the
    late 1980s and early 1990s.', Contaminants in Great Lakes fish., Total PCB in
    skinless fillets of 55- to 65-cm lake trout from the Canadian Great Lakes., 'Total
    2,3,7,8-TCDD in skinless fillets of 60-cm lake trout from the Canadian Great Lakes...',
  'Emerging contaminants of concern, including PBDEs and other persistent flame retardants,
    PFCs, and PCNs, have been measured in archived Great Lakes top predator fish to
    understand their temporal trends.', 'PBDEs increased from the 1980s through the
    early 2000s in fish from all the Great Lakes, while more recently, congeners found
    in the discontinued penta and octa mixtures have started to decline in Lake Ontario
    fish.', A 4-fold increase in perfluoroctanesulfonate was found from 1980 to 2001
    in Lake Ontario fish., 'PCNs have shown a dramatic  decline since 1979; however,
    the levels  are still above Ontarios fish consumption advisory guidelines for
    dioxin-like compounds.', Contaminant exposures in Great Lakes fish consumers.,
  Human consumption of contaminated Great Lakes fish is a source of exposure to these
    pollutants., 'The duration and quantity of Great Lakes fish consumption is reflected
    in higher body burdens of PCBs, PCDD/Fs, persistent chlorinated pesticides, and
    mercury in studies of Great Lakes fish consumers.', 'Figure 2 presents PCB levels
    in Great Lakes charter boat captains and their spouses, recruited because they
    consumed Great Lakes sport-caught fish, and levels in a nationally representative
    sample of the U.S. population of similar age and ethnicity.', 'PCB body burdens
    are higher in older age groups because of the higher exposures of this cohort
    born at the peak of PCB use and production  as well slow metabolism and clearance,
    with some congeners having half-lives of  10.', 'A temporal decline in PCBs was
    associated with decreased Great Lakes sport-caught fish consumption in this cohort,
    and a similar trend was also seen in another Great Lakes sport-caught fish consumer
    cohort.', This decrease was also influenced by the decline in PCB levels in the
    fish as well as PCB levels in the diet overall., 'Despite the declining levels,
    PCB levels remained higher in Great Lakes sport-caught fish consumers in 2004-2005
    than in a representative sample of the U.S. population in 2003-2004.', Sum of
    three PCB congeners in Great Lakes  sport-fish consumers and a representative
    sample of the U.S. population., Great Lakes sport-fish consumers were from a cohort
    of licensed Great Lakes charter boat captains and their spouses., PCB levels were...,
  'In this and other cohorts consuming Great Lakes sport-caught fish, men had higher
    serum levels of PCBs and persistent pesticides than women did.', 'This may be
    related to lower fish intake by women, elimination of contaminants via pregnancy
    and lactation, and the fact that women in general have a higher percentage of
    body fat in which to store contaminants.', 'However, Hanrahan et al.', 'found
    that although women ate less Great Lakes sport-caught fish than men, Great Lakes
    sport-caught fish consumption was a much stronger predictor of PCBs in women than
    length of lactation or adiposity.', The transfer of maternal hydrophobic contaminants
    through the placenta and via breast milk is an important source of exposure for
    developing children., PCB body burdens in adolescents who were breastfed were
    higher than those who were not breastfed., Variation in PCBs and other persistent
    pollutants across birth cohorts is a function of changes in both contaminant levels
    in fish and reproductive behaviors., Health effects of contaminants., 'Health
    effects of persistent pollutants have been seen in many studies, some with exposure
    levels similar to those found in Great Lakes fish consumers.', 'Exposures during
    gestation, infancy, and early childhood pose the greatest risk, but other factors
    may also modify outcomes, including sex, genetics, health status, and nutritional
    status.', 'Both PCBs and methylmercury are potent neurotoxicants, and the developing
    brain is considered more susceptible to impairment as a result of exposure than
    is the adult brain.', 'Deficits in cognitive function, including effects on IQ,
    memory, verbal abilities, motor skills, and visual-spatial skills, have been seen
    with prenatal and early-life exposure.', Methylmercury is also known to increase
    the risk of cardiovascular disease and nervous system dysfunction., 'The most
    potent dioxin congener, 2,3,7,8-TCDD, has been identified as a human carcinogen,
    while the World Health Organization has rated PCBs and most chlorinated pesticides
    as probable human carcinogens.', 'PCBs, PCDD/Fs, and organochlorine pesticides
    have been associated with a variety of adverse health effects, and, in the populations
    consuming fish from the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence system, have been adversely associated
    with neurodevelopment and cognition in children  and adults, in utero growth,
    reproduction, immune function, thyroid and steroid hormone regulation, diabetes,
    and cardiovascular disease.', 'However, fish consumption has not been associated
    with adverse health outcomes in all studies.', Fish are a good protein source
    with generally lower levels of saturated fats than other animal foods and are
    also substantial sources of selenium and omega-3 fatty acids., Omega-3 fatty acids
    are essential nutrients that are not synthesized by humans and thus must be consumed.,
  'The longer-chain omega-3 fatty acids, docosahexaenoic acid  and eicosapentaenoic
    acid, can be synthesized in humans from the shorter-chain -linolenic acid, but
    the biosynthetic pathway is slow and inefficient.', DHA and EPA are synthesized
    by phytoplankton and bioconcentrate through the aquatic food chain., 'All seafood
    and aquatic organisms contain some of the longer-chain omega-3 fatty acids, but
    cold-water fatty fish contain more DHA and EPA than lean fish.', Thus many of
    the fish species that have relatively high levels of omega-3 fatty acids also
    have relatively high levels of hydrophobic chemical pollutants., 'Although there
    are considerable data on omega-3 fatty acids in numerous species of fish from
    marine and freshwater systems, only three published reports are available, to
    our knowledge, on the content of omega-3 fatty acids in fish from the Great Lakes.',
  Wang et al., 'studied Lake Superior fish fillets with skin on, Chan et al.', 'examined
    skinned, defatted fish fillets collected from the St. Lawrence Seaway near Montreal,
    and Karahadian and Lindsay  measured lipids extracted from skinned trout fillets
    from Lakes Superior and Michigan.', 'Total median lipid in the Great Lakes fish
    varied, with higher levels in Lakes Superior and Michigan fish  compared with
    the St. Lawrence River fish.', 'This difference may be related to variation in
    fish location, species, and fillet preparation methods.', 'The sum of DHA + EPA
    accounted for 12-14% of total lipids in Great Lakes fish and 19-23% of total lipids
    in other types of fish, including marine fish purchased from Charleston  seafood
    markets  and fatty, cold-temperature marine fish and commonly consumed types of
    seafood measured by the National Nutrient Database.', 'Median DHA + EPA levels
    are, respectively, 1,048 and 1,062 mg/100 g fish for two studies of Great Lakes
    fish, 214 mg/100 g fish for marine fish from North Carolina, 263 mg/100 g fish
    for commonly consumed fish, and 1,449 mg/100 g fish for fatty, cold-temperature
    marine fish.', 'However, direct comparison of total DHA + EPA/100 g fish in these
    studies may not be appropriate because the methodology for fish sample preparation
    varied by study.', 'More data are needed to evaluate levels of omega-3 fatty acids,
    mercury, and POPs in commonly consumed fish from all of the Great Lakes, before
    and after cooking.', 'For comparison purposes, it is critical that techniques
    for preparing the fillets for testing be standardized across studies.', 'Omega-3
    fatty acids in Great Lakes and commercial fish: summary data from multiple species
    are described in Supplemental Material, Table 1.', Omega-3 fatty acids in Great
    Lakes fish consumers., 'Consumption of fish, and fatty fish in particular, is
    correlated with serum levels of omega-3 fatty acids.', 'For example, both fish
    and fish oil consumption were related to plasma DHA and EPA in a cohort of 4,949
    men and women from the United Kingdom.', 'However, the relationship of Great Lakes
    fish consumption to omega-3 fatty-acid levels in serum is unclear.', 'A study
    that included 243 consumers of sport fish from the St. Lawrence River concluded
    that neither total fish nor locally caught fish intake was related to serum omega-3
    fatty acids, while a positive association was found between serum omega-3 fatty
    acids and commercial fatty-fish intake.', 'Similarly, a second study of 112 male
    St. Lawrence River fish consumers found no association between fish intake and
    serum omega-3 fatty acids.', A third study recruited 86 Asian and Euro-Canadians
    who consumed at least 26 meals of Great Lakes fish annually., 'For Euro-Canadians,
    total plasma DHA and EPA were associated with total fish meals and with inland
    fish meals, but not with Great Lakes fish meals.', 'The lack of an association
    between Great Lakes fish intake and serum omega-3 fatty acids in these studies
    may be related to small sample sizes, at least in the second and third studies,
    or associations may have been obscured by fatty-acid intake from other unmeasured
    sources or imprecise measurement of fish intake.', 'Furthermore, participants
    may have been consuming fish low in total fat and/or omega-3 fatty acid, but none
    of these studies measured levels of omega-3 fatty acids in the fish actually consumed
    by the participants.', The absence of a relationship between freshwater fish consumption
    and serum omega-3 fatty-acid levels in these three studies of moderate and high
    fish consumers needs to be confirmed in other investigations that measure omega-3
    fatty acids in both fish consumers and in the fish they consume and should be
    expanded to include more of the fish-eating populations around the Great Lakes.,
  Health effects of omega-3 fatty acids., 'Omega-3 fatty acids are major components
    of neuronal, retinal, and myocardial membranes.', DHA constitutes 40% of all omega-3
    fatty acids in the brain and is important for neurological development and function.,
  'Consumption during pregnancy of fish not contaminated with mercury has been associated
    with increased cognitive function in the offspring, although the assessment of
    mercury and its adverse health effects were suboptimal in these studies.', Fish
    consumption has been linked with increased cognitive performance measured 3 years
    later in male adolescents compared with males who ate less fish., Oken et al.,
  'found that whereas higher fish consumption during pregnancy was associated with
    improved infant cognition, higher maternal hair mercury was associated with lower
    cognition, highlighting the dilemma for fish consumers.', Substantial evidence
    suggests that increased fish consumption has important cardiovascular benefits.,
  Several randomized controlled trials indicated that fish consumption and/or omega-3
    supplementation reduced the risk of sudden death in men recovering from a heart
    attack., 'The mechanism proposed is that omega-3 fatty acids increase membrane
    fluidity of cardiac muscle, reducing the risk of arrhythmia.', 'However, it is
    not clear that fish consumption reduces the risk of development of an initial
    heart attack.', 'Beneficial effects on the cardiovascular and nervous systems
    from fish consumption are thought to come primarily from the omega-3 fatty acids,
    but may also be related to decreased consumption of other animal fats.', Consumption
    of Great Lakes fish is of particular concern for several population groups., Consumption
    rates in women and children are important because of known developmental effects
    of pollutants., 'In addition, potentially larger pollutant exposures are possible
    in persons exposed through recreational, cultural or subsistence fishing.', 'Because
    all fish carry some levels of pollutants, it is necessary to consider total fish
    consumption rates, including commercial and sport-caught fish from the Great Lakes
    and other bodies of water.', 'In surveys of Great Lakes states populations, 7-8%
    of adults, or 4.2-4.7 million persons, reported consumption of Great Lakes sport-caught
    fish in the previous year, and 830,000 persons ate  24 Great Lakes sport-caught
    fish meals annually.', Adults who included Great Lakes sport-caught fish in their
    diet consumed more fish than those who consumed only commercially purchased fish.,
  Great Lakes sport-caught fish consumption rates were higher in men than women.,
  Fish consumption rates for persons consuming Great Lakes sport-caught fish in these
    two surveys are compared with consumption rates reported in studies of Great Lakes
    recreational and native anglers in Table 2., 'Maximum annual Great Lakes fish
    meals in these studies ranged from 126 to 960, suggesting large exposures to contaminants
    in some Great Lakes sport-caught fish consumers, depending on the types of fish
    consumed.', 'Commercial Great Lakes fish are sold widely in both Canada and the
    United States, but information about consumption rates is lacking.', Total and
    Great Lakes fish consumption in populations consuming Great Lakes fish., Consumption
    of sport-caught fish in children living in the Great Lakes Basin is related to
    their parents sport-fish consumption., 'A survey of the general population in
    Wisconsin and Minnesota found that 29-39% of children 2-17 years of age ate sport-caught
    fish, although consumption was infrequent, with more than half of the children
    eating less than six meals of sport-caught fish annually.', A study of children
    of New York anglers found that 39-48% of 4- to 10-year-old children consumed sport-caught
    fish  and 15-18% consumed Lake Ontario sport-caught fish., 'Consumption rates
    were lower for younger children: 5% of 1-year-old, 22% of 2-year-old, and 35%
    of 3-year-old children of anglers ate sport-caught fish.', These data suggest
    that children may be exposed to toxicants from Great Lakes fish during important
    developmental stages., 'However, because in utero toxicant exposures may pose
    a greater risk for adverse neurodevelopmental and other health outcomes than exposure
    after birth, Great Lakes fish consumption in women of childbearing age is also
    a concern.', 'Table 3 summarizes data on total fish and sport-caught fish consumption
    in studies of all adults, reproductive-age women, and pregnant women from the
    Great Lakes Basin.', 'In general, the proportions of persons consuming any fish
    and sport-caught fish were similar in these three groups.', Maximum rates indicated
    that some pregnant women greatly exceeded two fish meals per week., 'However,
    overall fish and shellfish consumption in reproductive-age women from the coastal
    regions of the Great Lakes states is lower compared with other coastal regions
    of the United States.', 'Fish consumption in adults, women of reproductive age,
    and pregnant women in the Great Lakes Basin.', 'Despite the need for such assessments,
    there is currently no accepted method to compare net risks with net benefits of
    consuming fish.', The few risk-benefit assessments for fish consumption that have
    been attempted have focused on methylmercury and omega-3 fatty acids in relation
    to cardiovascular disease and/or neurobehavioral outcomes., Overall health risks
    related to PCB and PCDD/F exposure through farmed salmon consumption have also
    been assessed., 'Some investigators have suggested that cardiovascular benefits
    from consumption of farmed salmon for adults &gt; 25 years of age outweigh cancer
    risks by 100-fold or more, while another group has calculated that the cumulative
    cancer risk from consumption of farmed salmon at rates that provide 1 g/day DHA
    + EPA would be 24 times higher than acceptable risk levels.', 'Risks related to
    PCBs, PCDD/Fs, and persistent pesticides are especially critical to evaluate for
    Great Lakes fish consumers because concentrations of these chemicals are in general
    higher than in commercial fish, as reflected by higher contaminant body burdens
    in Great Lakes fish consumers than in commercial fish consumers.', 'On the other
    hand, based on contamination levels, risks from mercury exposure may be less in
    Great Lakes fish consumers than in marine fish consumers.', 'In a study that followed
    Quebec women during pregnancy, the contribution of commercial fish  to mercury
    exposure was found to be more important than that from sport fish from the St.
    Lawrence River.', 'Few, if any, studies have evaluated cumulative risk from both
    PCBs and mercury.', 'This is an important question that needs to be addressed,
    as most Great Lakes fish consumers also consume commercially available marine
    fish.', 'In adults, risk assessments for fish frequently have focused on cardiovascular
    disease and mortality.', 'However, given the body of evidence for other health
    effects related to hydrophobic toxicants in Great Lakes fish, other end points
    such as cancer, diabetes, reproductive outcomes, immune system dysfunction, and
    decreased cognitive performance should be considered.', 'Although fish consumption
    has been reported to protect against cardiovascular disease, studies of Great
    Lakes fish consumers did not find protective associations of fish intake with
    cardiovascular disease mortality  or risk factors for cardiovascular disease.',
  'Ideally, risk assessments for Great Lakes fish should also consider factors that
    may interact with fish contaminants to affect health end points such as neurodevelopment.',
  'These factors include a) coexposures to multiple toxic pollutants from fish and
    other sources, including methylmercury, lead, and POPs; b) dietary intakes of
    nutrients such as omega-3 fatty acids, selenium, and other antioxidants--either
    from fish or from other sources--that could possibly counteract the negative effects
    of contaminants; c) sex differences in exposure or susceptibility; and d) the
    social environment.', An investigation of the neurodevelopmental impact of fish
    consumed from all sources found that simultaneous adjustment for both methylmercury
    and fish intake strengthened estimates of both benefits related to fish consumption
    and risks of mercury exposure., 'Thus, not controlling for beneficial factors
    can result in misestimation of health risks of toxic contaminants.', 'Other factors
    to consider in risk assessment include differences in Great Lakes fish contaminants
    by species, size, and location.', 'Meal size and storage and preparation methods,
    which can reduce exposure to lipophilic contaminants and/or degrade fatty acids,
    may vary for native populations, immigrant groups such as the Hmong, low-income
    persons who fish for subsistence, and recreational anglers.', 'In native, immigrant,
    and subsistence populations, sport-caught fish may be a diet staple that is difficult
    to replace because of economic constraints or unavailability of alternate food
    in isolated locales or because it would be replaced by less-nutritious foods with
    a less desirable fat profile, either way resulting in decreased health status.',
  'Furthermore, fishing may contribute to social, cultural, and recreational activities
    that have other health benefits.', 'As a cultural resource, fishing may hold a
    prominent place in religious and social ceremonies, teach survival skills, and
    contribute to social bonding in the family and community.', 'However, few studies  have
    documented the social and cultural benefits of fishing in populations consuming
    Great Lakes fish.', 'In conclusion, extensive data from many studies are available
    on the concentrations of bioaccumulative contaminants, including PCBs and DDE,
    both in Great Lakes fish and in Great Lakes fish consumers.', 'In contrast, studies
    on Great Lakes fish consumers that include concurrent measures of omega-3 fatty
    acids, chemical contaminants, and health end points are lacking.', Such studies
    would provide the strongest data to address the question as to whether the benefits
    of Great Lakes fish consumption outweigh the risks posed by ingestion of contaminants
    in the fish., 'In the absence of such studies, the most pressing need is for data
    on the omega-3 fatty-acid content in various fish species in the five Great Lakes.',
  'What little information has been published on the omega-3 fatty-acid content of
    even a limited number of fish species from Lake Superior, Lake Michigan, and the
    St. Lawrence River is &gt; 10 years old.', 'Moreover, the different species of
    fish in the five Great Lakes would be expected to vary in fatty-acid content depending
    on characteristics such as size, overall fat content, and location and temperature
    of the waters where they were caught.', What sparce data exist on omega-3 fatty-acid
    levels in consumers of fish from the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence system do not suggest
    a correlation between serum fatty-acid concentrations and consumption of fish
    from these waters., 'Further, none of the available studies actually measured
    the fatty-acid content of the fish being consumed.', 'Thus, our knowledge has
    critical gaps that need to be filled before a practical risk-benefit analysis
    can be made for the human consumption of Great Lakes fish.', We hope that this
    review will spur critical research that will fill these data gaps and permit risk-benefit
    analysis of Great Lakes fish consumption., This work was supported by the Science
