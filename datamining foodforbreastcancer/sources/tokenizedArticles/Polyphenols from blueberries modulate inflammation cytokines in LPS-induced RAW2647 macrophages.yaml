text: ['Polyphenols including 3-glucoside/arabinoside/galactoside-based polymers of
    delphinidins, petunidins, peonidins, malvidins and cyanidins are one type of biological
    macromolecules, which are extraordinarily rich in blueberries.', Anti-inflammatory
    activity of blueberry polyphenols  was investigated by using lipopolysaccharide  induced
    RAW264.7 macrophages., 'The results showed that BPPs suppressed the gene expression
    of IL-1, IL-6 and IL-12p35.', The inhibition effect on IL-1 and IL-6 mRNA was
    most obvious at the concentration of 10-200 g/mL BPPs., But the inhibition effect
    on IL-12p35 mRNA was increased with the increasing concentration of BPPs., 'When
    fixed at 100 g/mL BPPs, the most significant inhibition on IL-1, IL-6 and IL-12p35
    mRNA expression was detected at 12-48 h. In conclusion, BPPs exhibit anti-inflammation
    activity by mediating and modulating the balances in pro-inflammatory cytokines
    of IL-1, IL-6, and IL-12.']
