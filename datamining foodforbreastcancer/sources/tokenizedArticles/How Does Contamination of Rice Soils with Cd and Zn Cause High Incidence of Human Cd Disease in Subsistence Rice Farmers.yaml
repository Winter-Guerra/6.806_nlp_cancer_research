text: ['Rice  grown on Zn mine waste contaminated soils has caused unequivocal Cd
    effects on kidney and occasional bone disease  in subsistence rice farmers, but
    high intake of Cd from other foods has not caused similar effects.', 'Research
    has clarified two important topics about how Cd from mine waste contaminated rice
    soils has caused Cd disease:  bioaccumulation of soil Cd into rice grain without
    corresponding increase in Zn, and  subsistence rice diets potentiate Cd absorption/bioavailability
    and risk to farm families.', Absorption of Cd by rice roots occurs on the NRAMP5
    Mn2+ transporter., 'Although other transporters can influence Cd uptake-transport
    to shoots and grain, making NRAMP5 null greatly reduces grain Cd.', Zn2+ has little
    ability to inhibit Cd2+ transfer in rice but clearly inhibits Cd uptake in other
    plant species., The bioavailability of dietary Cd is increased for subsistence
    rice diets., Research has identified that low levels and bioavailability of Zn
    and Fe in polished rice grain cause upregulation of Cd absorption on the Fe2+
    transporter of duodenum cells., Added dietary Zn can also inhibit intestinal Cd
    absorption somewhat., Nutritional stress  in humans consuming subsistence rice
    diets thus promotes Cd accumulation and adverse effects., No other dietary  Cd
    exposure has caused unequivocal Cd-induced renal proximal tubular dysfunction  in
    humans., Recognition of the very unusual nature of Cd risk from rice compared
    to other crops should be taken into account in setting international limits of
    Cd in rice and other foods., 'Cadmium Zinc Manganese Oryza sativa NRAMP5 ZNT1
    Chelator-buffered Translocation Flooded


    Cadmium naturally occurs in Zn, Pb, and Cu ores with between 50 and 200 times
    more Zn than Cd on weight basis 1).', One of the consequences of mining and smelting
    these ores has been the Cd contamination of surrounding soils which commonly occurred
    until recent times after environmental contamination was better understood., 'Cadmium
    contamination of soils has been a concern since it was determined that Zn mine
    wastes, containing high levels of Zn and Cd, had contaminated rice paddies and
    caused kidney and bone  diseases for subsistence rice farmers in the Jinzu Valley
    of Japan.', The story of the discovery that Cd was the causal agent in itai-itai
    disease illustrates the unusual enrichment of Cd in diets of the subsistence rice
    farm families., 'The availability of a spectrograph which allowed measurement
    of Cd at low concentrations allowed analysis of soils, foods, and human tissues
    when few had previously studied Cd in biology.', 'Subsequently, populations in
    many locations in Japan  and China  and one location in Thailand  were similarly
    found to exhibit human Cd disease linked to subsistence rice farming although
    growing and smoking tobacco may have contributed to body Cd in some locations.',
  'Cadmium in Zn mine waste contaminated soils is readily taken up by plants, is transported
    to different edible plant tissues, and thereby enters the food chain as a food
    contaminant.', Food and smoking are the main pathways for human exposure to soil
    Cd., 'However, whether soil Cd reaches edible parts of plants is complex, varying
    in plant species and cultivars, and with soil properties especially soil pH, soil
    Eh, soil Zn, and chloride levels and Cd sorbent levels.', 'With a normal geochemical
    Cd/Zn ratio of 1:100 or greater, crops other than rice grown in contaminated soil
    have a natural limit to Cd uptake due to Zn phytotoxicity ; as the crop Cd level
    increases, the crop Zn level also increases.', 'Most crops such as leafy vegetables,
    legumes, storage roots/tubers, fruits, and grains maintain low levels of Cd in
    edible tissues when Cd and Zn soil levels are at 1:100 Cd/Zn  ratio.', 'When foliar
    Zn exceeds about 400500 mg kg1 dry weight, Zn causes phytotoxicity reducing crop
    yields and causing growers to identify the cause of the visual symptoms, limiting
    the transfer of soil Cd to humans or animals.', 'Further, for crops other than
    rice, when foliar Zn is greatly increased to the point of Zn phytotoxicity, grain
    Zn is substantially increased.', 'Most Zn phytotoxicity occurs in strongly acidic
    soils which promote uptake of Cd and Zn by plants, and normal limestone addition
    to increase pH and improve crop yields reduces crop Cd and Zn levels.', 'Although
    human Cd disease has occurred with as little as 5 mg Cd kg1 soil in rice soils,
    there have been cases where, as a result of vegetable garden soil Cd+Zn contamination,
    soil Cd levels were as high as 50150 mg Cd kg1, yet no kidney or bone diseases
    occurred in those consuming the produce, apparently because concurrent Zn levels
    were 500015,000 mg Zn kg1.', 'However, while most rice paddies that are contaminated
    with Cd also have 100-fold higher Zn than Cd, this ratio did not provide the usual
    protection from Cd seen with other crops.', Consumption of large amounts of seafood
    with Cd enrichment similarly had no effect on human Cd risk., The interaction
    between Zn and Cd in rice is clearly an anomaly compared to other foods., 'In
    addition, Zn in test diets with food levels of Cd  limited increase of Cd in kidney
    and liver even when Cd was significantly increased compared to basal diets.',
  'At food Cd levels, the co-contamination with Zn significantly reduces crop Cd bioavailability
    and risk except for rice consumption.', Cadmium accumulation by rice is anomalous
    compared to other staple crops., Takijima et al., 'found a wide range of Cd concentrations
    in rice paddy soils, yet found that total soil Cd was not correlated with Cd extractability
    nor with the Cd level in rice grain.', 'Instead, flooding period and soil pH strongly
    affected rice grain Cd levels.', 'In addition, the co-contamination with Zn had
    little influence on grain levels of Zn.', The paper by Fukushima et al., 'on Cd
    and Zn in the rice consumed by the farm families at Jinzu Valley also reported
    that rice grain Cd could be sharply increased when soils were contaminated by
    Zn mine wastes, but grain Zn was not increased.', 'In Thailand with extreme Cd+Zn
    contamination, grain Zn was not increased even when soils contained 7000 mg Zn
    kg1.', "Zn in rice grain is not increased despite massive Zn mine waste contamination
    of rice soils with Cd and Zn, while grain Cd is strongly increased with any contamination
    \n\nFor rice culture, soil redox potential and pH control the amount of Cd in
    soil solution and Cd uptake by roots.", Rice has traditionally been grown in flooded  soils.,
  'Under such anaerobic conditions, soil Mn and Fe oxyhydroxides are reduced to Mn2+
    and Fe2+, and pH rises toward 7.', 'Zn is either strongly adsorbed to soil sorbents
    or transformed to insoluble ZnS and Cd can precipitate as CdS, although it has
    been difficult to document the extent of CdS formation in flooded rice soils even
    using Extended X-Ray Absorption Fine Structure.', 'Although early researchers
    who reported the very strong effect of soil reduction on Cd uptake suggested that
    this could be explained by sulfide formation in flooded soils and formation of
    CdS, EXAFS evidence of CdS was first reported by Khaokew et al.', with highly
    contaminated Thai rice soils., De Livera et al., argue that these results did
    not explain the reduced Cd uptake adequately and suggested that mixed solid Cd-ZnS
    nanoparticles of sulfides undergoing redox might play a role., 'Subsequently,
    Fulda et al.', 'clearly showed that CdS was unequivocally formed in flooded Cd-spiked
    soils and that if sulfate was low compared to sulfide forming metals, or if Cu
    was high, CdS formation was appreciably inhibited and Cd uptake increased.', Perhaps
    this finding explains the unusually high transfer of Cd to rice grain grown in
    soils contaminated by Cu mine wastes which caused human Cd disease at lower soil
    Cd than other locations., 'Now it is clear that the main reason that rice accumulates
    Cd during grain filling is the role of NRAMP5 at the same time that soil oxidation
    with great lowering of soil solution Mn, and soil acidification increases Cd solubility
    in the rhizosphere.', Fulda et al., 'reported that soluble Mn dropped remarkably
    within 2 days after their flooded soils with CdS were made aerobic, which would
    strongly reduce competition for Cd uptake on NRAMP5.', 'In common rice production,
    the paddies are drained at the beginning of flowering to promote higher yields,
    disease resistance, and convenience of harvest.', 'As the drained paddy soils
    become aerobic and more acidic, CdS oxidizes, quickly becoming phytoavailable
    and causing rapid Cd uptake by rice.', A paper by Murakami et al., 'testing phytoextraction
    of soil Cd using a Cd-accumulating cultivar of rice showed that while the soil
    remained flooded, rice shoot Cd did not exceed 0.5 mg kg1 dry weight, but after
    aerobic soil growth, shoots reached over 3070 mg kg1.', Part of the increased
    phytoavailability of soil Cd is due to a strong reduction in soil pH in soils
    which occurs in non-calcareous rice soils as conditions become aerobic., 'The
    combination of these factors makes Cd more available for plant uptake without
    the inhibition by the higher levels of Zn, leading to a high uptake of Cd into
    the grain.', 'Because of the change in redox and soil pH during grain filling,
    soil extractions have been poor predictors of Cd accumulation in rice when either
    flooded or air-dried soils were tested.', 'But, testing of field moist soils collected
    during grain filling for 0.1 M CaCl2-extractable Cd  showed a strong correlation
    of extractable Cd with grain Cd.', The equation for predicting Cd in brown rice
    based on 0.10 M CaCl2-extractable Cd of field-moist soil during the grain filling
    period was highly significant., 'Consuming such high Cd, low Zn and Fe rice grain
    caused human disease in many locations.', "Correlation of Cd concentration in
    brown rice grain with Cd extractable from field-moist soils collected during grain
    filling using 0.1 M CaCl2 at 1 g soil 1 \n\nMany studies of genetic variation
    in rice grain Cd have been reported.", 'Some describe pollution safe cultivars,
    while others have identified the HMA3 genetic variation which when null so strongly
    increases Cd translocation to shoots and grain.', 'In most papers about countermeasures
    for contaminated rice fields, genetic improvement to lower Cd is included.', Experiments
    tested the ability of rice to accumulate solution Cd at different growth stages
    and to transport the Cd absorbed at several growth stages to the grain during
    filling., 'These studies showed that rice grown in aerobic nutrient solutions
    could absorb 109Cd and translocate it to leaves, and subsequently to grain at
    any time during growth.', 'Recently, Rodda et al.', studied Cd uptake and redistribution
    during grain filling and confirmed that part of the Cd absorbed into leaves during
    vegetative growth could move into grain but that most grain Cd was absorbed during
    the grain filling period and translocated directly to grain., 'As noted elsewhere,
    Cd is translocated from roots in xylem and transferred to phloem at shoot nodes
    and can be efficiently translocated to grain.', 'Thus, it was not the ability
    of rice plants to only transport Cd to grain only during grain filling but that
    the uptake of Cd was greatly increased at the time of grain filling  that is the
    important factor in why rice accumulates Cd in grain so much more effectively
    than other cereal grains.', 'Recently, it was learned that Cd uptake by rice occurs
    largely on the NRAMP5 transporter, a Mn2+ transporter in rice roots.', Ishikawa
    et al., generated heavy ion mutants of rice and tested Cd accumulation by 2592
    M2 plants grown in Cd+Zn contaminated rice soils., 'They subsequently tested these
    lines in three contaminated fields in Japan, finding that the three lines had
    almost no Cd  accumulation in grain when the parent wild-type rice accumulated
    0.55 to 1.8 mg Cd kg1.', Shoot Cd was similarly greatly reduced by the mutation.,
  'During flooded culture, Mn2+ concentration in soil solution is greatly increased
    due to microbial reduction of soil MnO2, which inhibits Cd uptake on NRAMP5.',
  Whether high soil solution Mn represses expression of NRAMP5 has not been clarified
    to date although the gene was reported to be constitutively expressed., Levels
    of Mn2+ used in testing repression may not have been representative of reduced
    paddy soils., Further study of the interaction of Mn2+ with Cd2+ uptake by rice
    showed that soil solution levels of Mn2+ in flooded soils strongly inhibited Cd
    uptake  extending the findings of Fulda et al., 'and Sasaki et al.. Further, in
    contrast with Cd absorption by other plant species, increased Zn2+ had little
    effect on Cd absorption by NRAMP5.', 'In previous studies of Cd uptake by wheat,
    lettuce and spinach, and sunflower, increased activities of Zn2+ significantly
    reduced Cd accumulation to shoots when environmentally relevant Cd and Zn levels
    were used.', 'Environmentally relevant activities of microelement cations are
    stressed because in early study of microelement divalent cation uptake by pea,
    it was suggested that Cd uptake could occur on the IRT1 Fe2+ transporter of roots.',
  'However, subsequent testing at other metal ion activities more similar to soil
    solution showed that IRT1 was only a Fe2+ transporter that likely played no role
    in accumulation of ions such as Zn2+, Cd2+, Ni2+, and Cu2+.', 'Study of Zn uptake
    by rice has shown that there are at least two levels of uptake affinity, a high
    affinity transporter with a K m  of 0.010 to 0.020 M and a low affinity transporter
    with K m of 620 M. Study at Cd levels &gt;0.1 M are irrelevant in understanding
    practical Zn accumulation from soils.', Similar high affinity Zn transport activity
    was reported by Hacisalihoglu et al., for bread wheat., Study at lower Cd2+ activity
    levels is difficult unless chelator buffering is used to control Cd and Zn activities
    at levels similar to soil solution., 'Green and Chaney  showed that with Cd activity
    which gives rice Cd levels found in the field, increased Zn activity had little
    effect on Cd uptake, confirming the field observations that Zn does not inhibit
    Cd accumulation by rice.', 'On the other hand, the Chino solution supplied more
    Mn and gave significantly lower Cd accumulation in rice shoots and grain than
    the Grusak solution both with the same buffered Cd2+ and Zn2 activity.', "Effect
    of solution Zn activity on rice accumulation of Cd and Zn in chelator-buffered
    nutrient solutions based on nutrient solutions used by M. Grusak and M. Chino
    in rice metals research   \n\nThe high affinity Zn transporter in rice is believed
    to be ZIP1 which is expressed in the epidermal membrane of root cells.", There
    have been many studies of Zn accumulation in rice in recent years because of the
    clear evidence that subsistence rice consumers may suffer Zn and Fe malnutrition.,
  Both agronomic and genetic methods to biofortify rice grain with Zn have been studied.,
  Improved bioavailable Zn in rice grain is also being evaluated for more water saving
    production methods., 'Even with aerobic soils, adding significant soluble Zn fertilizers
    has little effect on grain Zn concentration, while spray application of soluble
    Zn to leaves post-flowering  has significantly increased rice grain Zn levels.',
  Stomph et al., note the remarkable difference between rice and other studied grains
    in Zn uptake and transfer to grain in relation to soil applications., 'Further,
    although brown rice is increased appreciably in Zn by foliar Zn sprays during
    grain filling, endosperm is only slightly increased in Zn.', 'The transition to
    more aerobic rice production  effect on rice grain Zn concentration and bioavailability
    are also complex, while more aerobic soils invariably increase grain Cd.', Effect
    of alternate wetting and drying flood management on accumulation of As and Cd
    in rice grain., 'The water management varied from traditional full season flood,
    through alternative wetting and drying, to furrow irrigation only when the soil
    reached 40 or 60 % of water holding capacity


    The interaction between metals in the uptake process can either be antagonistic  or
    synergistic.', 'Antagonism between Cd and Zn has been reported by Honma and Hirata  with
    rice, and Chaney et al.', with sunflower)., 'Still other studies have reported
    synergism between Zn and Cd in rice, with an increase in Zn increasing the translocation
    of Cd from the roots to the shoots.', 'Yet when Cd and Zn were added in a ratio
    of 1:50 Cd:Zn, Cd concentration in the shoots decreased.', The demonstration of
    a key role of NRAMP5 in Cd accumulation in rice came from several research programs.,
  'In one, the researchers made mutants and grew out thousands of seeds to find any
    with lower accumulation of Cd in grain.', 'They characterized localization of
    the protein and expression, concluding that NRAMP5 was a significant transporter
    of Cd2+, Mn2+ and possibly Fe2+, but not Zn2+ into epidermal cells.', 'Although
    in testing to date the NRAMP5 null rice genotypes maintain yields and grain quality,
    uptake of Mn is strongly reduced.', 'If soils had not been flooded during the
    growth cycle in the research with the NRAMP5 null genotypes, it is possible that
    Mn would have become deficient for rice.', 'Over a period of years of aerobic
    culture of low Mn soils such as long term rice soils which have undergone repeated
    reduction and oxidation over centuries, Mn phytoavailability can decline even
    to deficient levels.', 'In that study, application of high rates of a high Fe
    biosolids to a low Mn Maryland soil caused Mn deficiency of wheat and soybean
    after about 15 years post biosolids application.', It took that long for the soil
    redox and Mn chemistry to reach low phytoavailable Mn and cause Mn deficiency
    in wheat and even in maize., So it is not clear if the NRAMP5 null rice cultivar
    will maintain agronomic performance in the long term with aerobic production.,
  Long-term performance under aerobic conditions is an important question because
    of the newly understood need to produce rice aerobically to minimize accumulation
    of inorganic As  in rice grain., 'Because arsenate is reduced to the much more
    soluble  arsenite in flooded soils, and because arsenite is accumulated into rice
    on the silicate transporter, rice grown with traditional flood culture is higher
    in iAs than other food crops and may exceed the newly established CODEX limit
    of 0.20 mg iAs kg1.', 'Unfortunately, aerobic production to reduce grain iAs simultaneously
    causes grain Cd to increase as discussed above.', Other transporters are important
    in Cd accumulation in rice and other plant species., 'In particular, the HMA3
    protein pumps Cd2+ into root vacuoles of rice  and soybean.', Over-expression
    of the HMA3 protein greatly reduced Cd transport to shoots and grain without changing
    uptake or transport of Zn or other nutrients., 'However, adoption of transgenic
    improved cultivars over-expressing HMA3 is not accepted in many nations, and simple
    breeding using normal genotypes offers little hope of lowering crop Cd through
    change in HMA3 expression.', 'HMA3-null rice has been identified as a potentially
    valuable phytoextraction crop because growing these genotypes under aerobic soil
    conditions, especially with acidic soils, allows high Cd accumulation in rice
    shoots, and the high shoot yields allow significant removal of Cd from the field.',
  'Another gene, HMA2, is involved in translocation of Cd and Zn from roots to shoots,
    and yet another  may affect low affinity Cd transport from leaves into grains.',
  An important advance in understanding of Cd uptake and translocation in rice was
    achieved by Fujimaki et al., who used a positron-emitting tracer imaging system  to
    follow Cd uptake and translocation in real time., 'This work illustrated the rapid
    transfer of Cd from xylem to phloem in basal nodes of the rice plant, helping
    to explain the highly efficient transfer of absorbed Cd into the grain after field
    drainage.', 'In other plant species, Zn strongly inhibits Cd uptake and translocation.',
  'The interaction can occur due to correction of Zn deficiency reducing upregulation
    of the Zn2+ transporter thereby reducing Cd uptake, or the simple competition
    of Zn with Cd uptake by the ZIP1 discussed above.', Another important aspect of
    subsistence rice farming is that locally  grown crops are consumed by the farm
    family., 'For most other staple foods, crops are processed off-farm so that individuals
    do not consume only crops grown on contaminated soils for long periods.', 'For
    urban populations, crops from many farms are commingled preventing consumption
    of only highly contaminated crop for long periods.', Some other subsistence crops
    are consumed locally but are not known to accumulate bioavailable Cd as effectively
    as rice  from common Cd+Zn mine or smelter contamination., 'It should be recognized
    that some Cd sources for soils lack the Zn of mine wastes, which allows high Cd
    phytoavailability and bioavailability thru all crops.', Research using food levels
    of Cd has clearly shown that absorption of Cd is inhibited by Zn in the test meal  and
    strongly increased by Fe deficiency status of the individual., Research by Reeves
    and collaborators attempted to clarify the role of the nutrient deficiencies of
    rice subsistence diets in increased Cd absorption., 'These studies showed that
    under marginal Fe-Zn-Ca malnutrition which did not reduce growth rates of rats,
    Cd absorption was increased as much as 10-fold compared to adequately nourished
    rats  and that Cd in sunflower kernels had lower bioavailability than Cd in polished
    rice.', 'They then did a pulse-chase kinetic study of 109Cd absorption and retention
    in tissues from Zn-Fe-Ca marginal diets versus adequate Zn-Fe-Ca diets which showed
    about 10-fold higher Cd absorption into enterocytes on the marginal diets, and
    long turnover in the intestine which caused much higher net Cd absorption.', 'After
    the dose, 109Cd continued to accumulate in the kidney until after the intestine
    had released all 109Cd.', 'Further, a test with metallothionein-null mutant versus
    wild-type mice showed that metallothionein  played no role in Cd absorption at
    dietary levels of Cd exposure in contrast with toxicological studies at high doses
    commonly reported.', This work illustrates the error in understanding animal Cd
    physiology which resulted from toxicological type testing with rats and other
    animals., 'In those studies, diet Cd is often higher than diet Zn or Fe, changing
    absorption patterns and competitions, and causing induction of metallothionein
    biosynthesis which traps Cd in the intestine cells.', Huge numbers of papers on
    Cd absorption are irrelevant due to the use of toxicological doses rather than
    food Cd levels., "a Concentration of 109Cd in whole intestine of rats fed with
    Fe-Zn-Ca marginal or adequate diets during 64 days post-feeding; b concentration
    of 109Cd in kidney of rats fed with Fe-Zn-Ca marginal or adequate diets during
    64 days post-feeding \n\nMisunderstanding of food Cd risks has led to difficulty
    in setting limits for allowable Cd in foods.", 'After years of review, the Joint
    Expert Committee on Contaminants and Food Additives   established 7 g Cd 1 week1
    as a limit for chronic ingestion of dietary Cd.', A later European Food Safety
    Agency   examined the same data and suggested that maximum daily intakes of Cd
    should be no higher than 2.5 g Cd 1 week1., The JECFA  panel re-evaluated the
    Cd limit and lowered it slightly and made the recommendation to use a monthly
    intake limit 1 month1) to stress the long-term nature of food Cd risks., 'Even
    with this international opinion, the EFSA panel continued with their lower Cd
    intake recommendation.', 'Based on the summary of dietary Cd exposure to Cd+Zn
    contaminated soils above, and the improved understanding of animal absorption
    of Cd at dietary levels, it seems clear that several important over-estimations
    of dietary Cd risk are being made by many scientists.', 'If humans exposed to
    a number of food Cd contamination sources have been shown to consume the Cd but
    not have increased Cd in blood, kidney, or urine, important differences in food
    Cd bioavailability are not being taken into account in derivation of food Cd limits.',
  'In addition, some foods have significantly lower Cd bioavailability due to the
    presence of oxalate, phytate, and fiber in the food.', 'Spinach is a known Cd
    accumulator crop, but the presence of oxalate in this food substantially reduces
    net Cd absorption compared to other foods  apparently due to formation of a Ca-Cd-oxalate
    co-precipitate in the digestive system.', 'Numerous papers have illustrated that
    added Zn reduces absorption of Cd from test diets, even from intrinsic labelled
    diets.', 'When crops are grown with geogenic ratios of Cd to Zn, Zn inhibits Cd
    uptake by the crop, limits yield of the crop with smaller increases in crop Cd,
    and also reduces Cd bioavailability in the edible crop to the consumer.', 'Because
    most Cd absorption research does not include the natural 100-fold increased crop
    Zn that accompanies Cd in mine waste contaminated soils and crops, predictions
    of risk from that source are greatly over-estimated for crops other than rice.',
  'In addition, adverse effects of Cd in humans are often over-stated.', Examination
    of the extensive human Cd exposure and disease in Japan suggests that no one would
    experience initial proximal renal tubular dysfunction until urinary Cd exceeded
    1012 g 1 in urine., 'Examination of over 10,000 middle-aged non-smoking Japanese
    urban women consuming considerably higher daily Cd in their diet than Europeans  showed
    that even when urine contained 3 g Cd 1, there was no evidence of renal tubular
    disease  in direct contradiction of the views of the EFSA panel.', 'One needs
    to recognize potential bias from selection of a cutoff of urinary 2-microglobulin
    or other proximal tubular dysfunction indicators in urine when the normal geometric
    mean is 100 and strong Cd disease causes 2-microglobulin to rise above 100,000
    g 1.', 'Further, when smoking is a more significant source of kidney Cd in smokers
    than food Cd for non-smokers, evaluating Cd effects in mixed populations of smokers
    and non-smokers may give artifacts.', 'Many diseases are induced by chronic smoking,
    while chronic ingestion of Cd is only connected clearly with high consumption
    of rice homegrown on mine waste contaminated paddy soils which causes proximal
    tubular renal dysfunction and occasionally osteomalacia  after prolonged Cd kidney
    disease.', The new concerns about As in rice make Cd in rice a more important
    issue to be considered in management of rice production., 'As discussed above,
    growing rice with more aerobic soil management can significantly reduce iAs in
    rice grain, a desired outcome.', 'However, any increase in aerobic condition during
    growth and especially during grain filling can significantly increase grain Cd.',
  Efforts to reduce rice iAs must balance this goal against the potential increase
    in rice Cd with more aerobic production practices., 'I gratefully acknowledge
    decades of discussion about rice and Cd with Dr. M. Chino, Dr. James A. Ryan,
    Dr. M.R.S.', 'Fox, and Dr. Philip G. Reeves who all helped me sort out the soil,
    plant, and animal aspects of soil Cd risks to humans.', 'Dr. Chino hosted my visit
    to Tokyo, Okayama, Kanazawa, Toyoma, and Tskuba in 1982 which helped me better
    understand the Jinzu Valley case and the program of soil remediation to reduce
    rice Cd levels in Japan, and to better design research to sort out factors involved
    and to seek improved understanding resulting in the present synthesis.']

  Human Cd Disease in Subsistence Rice Farmers
