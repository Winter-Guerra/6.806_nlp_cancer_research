text: [Ursolic acid  has been reported to possess anticancer activities., 'Although
    some of the anticancer activities of UA have been explained by its apoptosis-inducing
    properties, the mechanisms underlying its anticancer actions are largely unknown.',
  We have found that UA-activated autophagy induced cytotoxicity and reduced tumor
    growth of cervical cancer cells TC-1 in a concentration-dependent manner., 'UA
    did not induce apoptosis of TC-1 cells in vitro as determined by annexin V/propidium
    iodide staining, DNA fragmentation, and Western blot analysis of the apoptosis-related
    proteins.', 'We found that UA increased punctate staining of light chain 3, which
    is an autophagy marker.', 'LC3II, the processed form of LC3I which is formed during
    the formation of double membranes, was induced by UA treatment.', These results
    were further confirmed by transmission electron microscopy., 'Wortmannin, an inhibitor
    of autophagy, and a small interfering RNA  for autophagy-related genes  reduced
    LC3II and simultaneously increased the survival of TC-1 cells treated with UA.',
  We also found that LC3II was significantly reduced and that survival was increased
    in Atg5/ mouse embryonic fibroblast  cells compared to Atg5+/+ MEF cells under
    UA treatment., 'However, silencing BECN1 by siRNA affected neither the expression
    of LC3II nor the survival of TC-1 cells under UA treatment.', These results suggest
    that autophagy is a major mechanism by which UA kills TC-1 cells., It is Atg5
    rather than BECN1 that plays a crucial role in UA-induced autophagic cell death
    in TC-1 cells., The activation of autophagy by UA may become a potential cancer
    therapeutic strategy complementing the apoptosis-based therapies., 'Furthermore,
    regulation of Atg5 may improve the efficacy of UA in cancer treatment.', Autophagy
    is a phenomenon that occurs in all eukaryotic cells ranging from yeast to mammals.,
  'Like apoptosis, autophagy has been suggested to be an important mechanism in maintaining
    cellular homeostasis in response to a variety of stimuli such as nutrient deprivation,
    high temperatures, and hypoxia.', Autophagy begins with the formation of a double-membrane
    structure called autophagosome which contains subcellular structures., These autophagosomes
    fuse with lysosomes to become autolysosomes where their contents are degraded
    into parts that can be reused elsewhere in the cell., The molecular mechanism
    of autophagy was initially studied in yeast., 'In total, more than 20 different
    autophagy-related genes  have been identified.', 'Among them, BECN1  acts during
    the nucleation and expansion of the autophagosomal membrane.', 'The microtubule-associated
    protein light chain 3, LC3, is associated with the double membranes of autophagosomes.',
  'The recruitment of LC3 to the membrane occurs via an Atg5-dependent mechanism,
    and thus Atg5 is essential for autophagosome formation.', Increasing evidence
    has shown that autophagy is involved in tumorigenesis., 'It has been reported
    that when organelles and portions of the cytoplasm are degraded beyond a certain
    threshold, autophagic cell death is induced.', It is also possible that autophagy
    can kill the cells by selective degradation of essential proteins., Autophagic
    cell death is regulated by a molecular mechanism distinct from that of apoptosis
    although BECN1 and Bcl-2 can cooperate with Atg5 to regulate both autophagy and
    apoptosis., This cell death may prevent neoplasia and thus the activation of the
    nonapoptotic autophagic cell death program is emerging as a potential cancer therapy
    complementing apoptosis-based therapies., 'Ursolic acid, a natural pentacyclic
    triterpenoid carboxylic acid, is a potent anticancer agent.', 'It has been shown
    to prevent tumorigenesis, inhibit tumor growth and suppress angiogenesis.', 'UA
    was shown to sensitize cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agents, to induce cancer
    cell apoptosis and to inhibit the growth of DU145 cells in nude mice.', 'UA was
    found to trigger apoptosis in MCF-7 breast cancer cells, inhibit the proliferation
    of mutated human colorectal cancer cells and induce apoptosis in cervical carcinoma
    cells.', 'Although the anticancer activities of UA may partially be attributable
    to its apoptosis-inducing properties, the exact mechanisms of its anticancer actions
    are largely unknown.', Efficacy of anticancer chemotherapeutic drugs relies on
    their ability to trigger cell death., 'Some anticancer drugs such as tamoxifen,
    arsenic trioxide, resveratrol and soybean B-group have been recently reported
    to induce autophagic cell death.', 'In our study, we tested the hypothesis that
    UA also induces autophagic cell death under certain conditions.', 'We demonstrated
    that UA promotes tumor cell autophagy, resulting in nonapoptotic cell death and
    a delay of tumor growth in vivo.', We further showed that Atg5 plays a crucial
    role in UA-induced autophagic cell death while BECN1 makes little contribution.,
  'UA  was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide, and stored at 20C.', 'Empirical formula:
    C30H48O3; molecular weight: 456.70.', 'Primary antibodies including anti-caspase-3,
    anti-Bax, anti-Atg5 and anti-LC-3 were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, anti-caspase-9,
    anti-poly polymerase, anti-Bcl-2 and anti-BECN1 antibodies were purchased from
    Cell Signaling Technology.', Anti-GAPDGH primary antibody and all secondary antibodies
    were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology., Two cervical cell lines TC-1 and

    in DMEM.', Both media were supplemented with 10% v/v fetal bovine serum and 1%
    v/v penicillin/streptomycin., Cells were grown at 37C in a humidified atmosphere
    consisting of 5% CO2., 'In some experiments, cells were exposed to various inhibitors
    for 1 hr prior to UA treatment, such as 10 mM 3-methyladenine, 400 nM Wortmannin
    and 50 mM LY294002 to inhibit phosphoinositide 3-kinase ; 10 mM U0126 to inhibit
    MEK1/2; 20 M SB203580 to inhibit the activation of MAPK; 20 M SP600125 to inhibit
    the activation of JUN; or 100 nM Bafilomycin, 2 g/mL E64d and Pepstatin to inhibit
    degradation of LC3 II.', All of these inhibitors were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.,
  'Female C57BL/6J mice  were purchased from the Laboratory Animal Services Center,
    Sun Yat-sen University, and fed a standard animal diet and water ad libitum.',
  'Tumor cells were harvested by trypsinization, washed twice with 1 phosphate-buffered
    saline  and finally resuspended in PBS to the designated concentration for injection.',
  Viable cells  were inoculated in the left legs of mice., The mice were randomly
    grouped  and subcutaneously injected with various doses of UA  for 10 weeks.,
  'About 2 weeks after inoculation with TC-1 tumor cells, tumors were visible in the
    left legs of the mice.', Tumor growth was monitored by visual inspection and palpation
    twice a week., 'The tumor diameters were measured and the tumor volume  was calculated
    as follows: volume= 2  /2.', The animals were sacrificed in the tenth week after
    the tumor cell injection., All experiments were carried out according to the National
    Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals  revised
    1996., Cell proliferation was assessed by methylthiazolyltetrazolium  assays.,
  Cells  were cultured in 96-well plates in the presence  or absence of UA in a final
    volume of 200 L for 5 days., 'At the end of the treatment, 10 L of MTT  was added
    to each well.', 'After 2 hr of incubation, MTT formazan precipitate was dissolved
    in 100 L of dimethyl sulfoxide.', We allowed the plates to stand for 10 min at
    room temperature and recorded the absorbance at 560 nm., Tests were performed
    at least three times., 'Cell viability was tested by first plating wild-type Atg5+/+
    MEFs, Atg5/ MEFs or TC-1 cells at 2  105 cells/well in six-well plates.', 'On
    the following day, UA  was added and the cells were further cultured for 24 hr
    at 37C.', Viability was measured by trypan blue exclusion assay., Each data point
    was the average of three different experiments in duplicates., Apoptosis rates
    were determined by flow cytometry using an annexin V/propidium iodide  kit., Staining
    was performed according to the manufacturers instructions., 'The percentages of
    cells staining annexin V positive but PI negative were calculated as early apoptosis
    rate, whereas those of cells staining annexin V and PI double positive were calculated
    as percentages of total dead cells.', 'DNA fragmentation, which is an indicator
    of apoptosis, was measured by DNA fragmentation assay using spectrophotometry.',
  The procedures were according to the instructions of Apoptotic DNA Ladder Kit.,
  'Cell extracts were prepared from TC-1 cells  treated with UA at concentrations
    of 0, 10, 20 or 30 M for 48 hr.', 'After electrophoresis in a 1.8% agarose gel,
    the gel was stained with ethidium bromide and the DNA ladder was visualized under
    UV light.', Cells grown in 10-cm dishes were treated with UA for 48 hr and then
    analyzed via Western blotting., Protein samples  were loaded to 12% SDS-PAGE gels.,
  'After separation, the protein bands were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes.',
  'The membranes were blocked with TBST buffer containing 5% nonfat milk, incubated
    with a primary antibody  for the detection of caspase-3, PARP, caspase-9, Bcl-2
    and Bax proteins at 4C overnight, followed by the addition of horseradish peroxidase-linked
    antirabbit antibody  and enhanced chemiluminescence visualization of the bands.',
  All Western blot experiments were repeated at least three times and the representative
    images were shown., 'Cells were initially fixed in 0.1 M of sodium phosphate buffer
    containing 2.5% glutaraldehyde, pH 7.4, and then fixed in the same buffer containing
    1% osmium tetroxide, pH 7.2.', Cells were next embedded into Ultracut  and sliced
    into 60-nm sections., 'Ultrathin sections were stained with uranyl acetate and
    lead citrate, and examined with a JEM-1230 transmission electron microscope.',
  'TC-1 cells  cultured in a six-well tissue plate were transiently transfected with

    if p ; 0.05., 'To assess the effects of UA on TC-1 cell proliferation in vitro,
    we treated the cells with increasing concentrations of UA for 5 days and assayed
    the cell growth by MTT assays.', Dose-response curves were plotted and showed
    that UA strongly inhibited TC-1 cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner.,

  'To evaluate the effects of UA on tumor growth in vivo, we used a well-established
    TC-1 xenograft mouse model.', Tumor growth was significantly inhibited in the
    UA-treated groups compared to the control group; the decrease in tumor growth
    was UA dose dependent., 'After the mice were treated with UA for 10 weeks, only
    small tumors were macroscopically visible near the left leg; in contrast, much
    larger tumors are visible in the control mice.', Histological examination of tumor
    sections showed the presence of a significant amount of necrosis in the tumors
    of UA-treated mice as indicated by the arrows in Figure 1f., 'Taken together,
    these results suggested that UA strongly inhibited the proliferation of TC-1 cells
    in vitro and significantly reduced tumor growth in vivo.', 'To explore the mechanism
    underlying tumor growth inhibition caused by UA, we first examined the effect
    of UA on apoptotic death of TC-1 by FACS analysis using annexin V/PI staining.',
  'As shown in Figure 2a, the total percentage of dead cells gradually increased in
    a UA dose-dependent manner.', 'However, the percentage of the early apoptotic
    cells  did not significantly increase.', The result revealed that the strong cytotoxic
    effect of UA may not involve apoptosis of TC-1 cells., Figure 2\., UA did not
    induce apoptosis in TC-1 cells., Flow cytometry analysis of TC-1 cells treated

    cells lysates for caspase-3, caspase-8, PARP, Bcl-2 and Bax.', GAPDH was used
    to normalize protein loading., We then performed DNA fragmentation assays., The
    result showed that UA did not induce any DNA fragmentation under the concentration
    range used., 'However, the DNA ladder, typically indicative of apoptosis, became
    apparent in HeLa cells treated with UA.', Apoptosis is a highly regulated process
    that involves activation of a series of molecular events leading to cell death.,
  Regulation of the apoptotic pathway is controlled by apoptosis-related proteins.,
  'Therefore, we assessed the expression of apoptosis-related proteins, including
    caspase-3, caspase-9, PARP, Bcl-2 and Bax, by Western blot analysis.', No significant
    differences in these proteins were observed in TC-1 cells treated with UA at different
    concentrations., 'Taken together, these results suggest that the in vitro proliferation
    suppressing activity and the in vivo tumor growth inhibitory effect of UA are
    not primarily owing to the induction of apoptosis, rather owing to the induction
    of nonapoptotic death in TC-1 cells.', Transmission electron microscopy was used
    to monitor autophagy of TC-1 cells in response to UA., 'After exposure to 30 M
    of UA for 24 hr, there were a large number of autophagic vacuoles presented in
    UA-treated cells, but not in untreated cells.', The presence of double-membrane
    containing cellular organelles was observed in TC-1-treated cells at higher magnification.,
  UA-treated HeLa cells exhibited typical apoptosis characteristics in nucleus change.,

    with UA accumulated vacuoles in cytoplasm and displayed punctuated staining of
    LC3, a marker of autophagosome.', Induction of autophagy was confirmed by Western
    blotting for LC3., 'LC3 II, a processed form of LC3I formed during the formation
    of the double membrane, was increased by UA treatment in a concentration-dependent
    manner.', Figure 4\., Autophagy was induced by UA in TC-1 cells., Response of

    were compared to those of GAPDH.', 'TC-1 cells were treated with UA for 24 hr
    in the presence or absence of U0126, 3MA, Wortmannin, Bafilomycin, E64d or Pepatatin.',
  Whole-cell lysates were obtained and the content of LC3 I and LC3 II was determined
    by Western blotting., 'Cell survival of different groups, each point of the cell
    survival is calculated by the average of different experiments in triplicate as
    the percent of untreated plated.', p  0.05., TC-1 cells treated with UA in the
    presence or absence of inhibitors were used to assess both the induction of autophagy
    and the autophagic flux caused by UA., 'Figure 4c shows that the increased expression
    of LC3II was abrogated by Wortmannin and LY294002, two PI3K inhibitors.', 'Although
    3-MA did not have a significant effect, the results indicated that PI3K signaling
    may be involved in UA-induced autophagy.', 'In contrast, Bafilomycin, E64d and
    Pepstatin decreased the degradation of LC3 in lysosomes, which in turn, caused
    both LC3I and LC3II accumulation in TC-1 cells.', 'The MEK inhibitor U0126, the
    p38 inhibitor SB203580 and the JUN inhibitor SP600125 had little effects on autophagy
    induced by UA, indicating that MAPK signaling is not involved in UA-induced autophagy
    in TC-1 cells.', 'To determine whether autophagy induced by UA was responsible
    for the reduced viability of TC-1 cells, we measured the viability after 24 hr
    of UA treatment.', 'The viability of TC-1 cells was significantly restored by
    Wortmannin, but not by LY294002 or 3-MA.', 'Moreover, the increase in autophagy
    induced by Bafilomycin A, E64d and Pepstatin was accompanied by a decrease in
    TC-1 viability.', This data pointed out a previously unseen role of UA in inducing
    autophagy that leads to cell death in TC-1 cells., 'We hypothesized that if autophagy
    was important in UA cytotoxicity to tumor cells, Atg5/ cells would be less sensitive
    to UA.', 'In our study, we found significantly more cell viability during UA treatment
    in Atg5/ cells as compared to Atg5+/+ cells.', This effect correlates with the
    LC3 II processing that was observed only in Atg5+/+ cells in response to UA and
    was concentration dependent., Silencing of Atg5 in TC-1 tumor cells by siRNA decreased
    the expression of LC3 II  and reduced the UA cytotoxicity in TC-1 cells., 'BECN1,
    an essential mediator of autophagy, plays pivotal role during the nucleation and
    expansion of the autophagosomal membrane, we explored whether BECN1 is required
    in autophagosome formation in UA-treated cells.', 'However, reduction of BECN1
    levels by siRNA affected neither the expression of LC3II nor the survival of TC-1
    cells during UA treatment.', 'Taken together, our results suggested that cell
    death of TC-1 cells induced by UA is dependent on Atg5, but not BECN1.', 'The
    results indicated that Atg5, but not BECN1, is involved in UA-induced autophagy
    and toxicity in TC-1 tumor cells.', Figure 5\., 'Atg5, but not Beclin 1 is required
    in autophagosome formation in UA-treated cells.', Atg5+/+ MEFs and Atg5/ MEFs

  'Western blot for BECN1 and LC3 in TC-1 cells transiently transfected with siRNA
    against BECN1, and then exposed to UA for 24 hr.', Schematic diagram shows the
    mechanism by which UA induces cell death in TC-1 cells., The results of our study
    have shown that UA is highly effective in inducing death of TC-1 cells and inhibiting
    tumor growth in a TC-1 xenograft mouse model., Mechanistic study showed that the
    apoptotic pathway was not activated by UA in TC-1 cells., 'Instead, autophagy
    may be a major mechanism for TC-1 cell death induced by UA and UA-induced autophagy
    was dependent on Atg5, but not on BECN1.', TC-1 cells were derived from primary
    lung epithelial cells and immortalized by HPV 16 E6/E7 and then transformed with
    an activated ras oncogene., This transformation process imitates the natural tumor
    progression of cervical cancer., We found that UA did not change the level of
    HPV 16 E6 gene and Ras expression., 'But UA decreased the expression of HPV18
    E6/E7 gene in HeLa cells, suggesting that UA exerts effects on TC-1 cells and
    HeLa cells by different mechanisms.', 'UA has been reported to possess anticancer
    activities through inducing apoptosis of tumor cells, such as gastric cancer cell
    line BGC-803, hepatocellular cancer cell HepG2 and MCF-7 breast cancer cells.',
  'However, TC-1 cell death induced by UA lacked the features of apoptosis, such as
    nuclear fragmentation, apoptotic body formation and chromatin condensation.',
  'In the absence of these characteristics of apoptosis, mitochondrial swelling  and
    autophagic vacuoles were observed instead.', Transmission electron microscopy
    showed a marked activity of autophagy with accumulation of autophagosomes., The
    formation of autophagosomes was confirmed by using autophagy marker LC3., Immunofluorescence
    studies revealed a clear accumulation of LC3 in the autophagosomes of UA-treated
    cells., LC3 is a microtubule-associated protein that is associated with the formation
    of autophagosomes through the conversion of LC3I  to LC3II., 'Our studies showed
    that LC3II was increased by the treatment of UA in a concentration-dependent manner,
    indicating that autophagic process is tightly linked to UA cytotoxicity.', 'Several
    signaling transduction pathways have been reported to be involved in autophagy,
    such as the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase  pathway and the Ras/MEK/ERK pathway.',
  It appears that upstream signals to induce autophagy are stimulus dependent., 'In
    our study, the increase in expression of LC3II was abrogated by Wortmannin and
    LY294002, two PI3K inhibitors.', The results indicate that PI3K is required as
    an initial signal in UA-induced autophagy., 'However, 3-MA, another PI3K inhibitor,
    did not significantly decrease the expression of LC3II.', 'The reason may be that
    3-MA can inhibit both Class I PI3K activity  and Class III PI3K activity, and
    thus the overall effect of 3-MA may not be apparent.', 'Interestingly, the viability
    of TC-1 cells was significantly restored by Wortmannin.', 'However, similar results
    were not observed by using LY294002.', LY294002 may have some additional effects
    on cell survival by targeting its ATP-binding site., Autophagic flux can be measured
    by inferring degradation of LC3II in autolysosomes., 'Inhibiting the degradation
    can be achieved by using bafilomycin, which blocks the fusion of autophagosomes
    with lysosomes, and protease inhibitors.', 'Bafilomycin, E64d and pepstatin resulted
    in accumulation of both LC3I and LC3II in the TC-1 cells, and hence increased
    the total LC3 level induced by UA while simultaneously decreasing the viability
    of TC-1 cells.', This is owing to the fact that when LC3 levels are beyond a certain
    threshold autophagic cell death may be enhanced., 'Taken together, these data
    revealed a previously unseen role for UA in inducing autophagy-mediated death
    of TC-1 cells.', 'We test the effect of UA on other two gynecological tumor cell
    lines: ID8 and 4T1.', 'ID8, a cell line derived from spontaneous in vitro malignant
    transformation of C57BL/6 mouse ovarian surface epithelial cells.', 4T1 cells
    were the mouse breast cancer cell line., 'We also found that UA increased the
    level of autophagy in both 4T1 and ID8 with dose-dependent manner, meanwhile significantly
    decreased the viability of the two cell lines.', Autophagy and autophagic cell
    death may share common machinery utilizing Atg5., 'Atg5 plays a crucial role in
    IFN--induced autophagic cell death by interacting with FADD as a necessary step
    leading to cell death, whereas upregulation of Atg5 is necessary for the oncogenic
    H-ras-induced autophagic cell death.', 'Our study showed that Atg5 was required
    for LC3-II expression in UA-treated cells, and was thus involved in autophagic
    cell death in response to UA.', These findings implicate a role for Atg5 in promoting
    UA-mediated autophagic cell death., BECN1 acts as a tumor suppressor gene in mice
    and is frequently deleted in human cancers., BECN1 is involved in some autophagic
    cell deaths but not in others., The BECN1-independent autophagic death is attracting
    increasing interests in the development of new strategies for cancer treatment.,
  Pathological stimulation of BECN1-independent autophagy is associated with neuronal
    cell death., Arsenic trioxide induced a BECN1-independent autophagic pathway in
    ovarian carcinoma cells., 'In our study, inhibition of BECN1 by siRNA did not
    change the expression of LC3II and cell death in response to UA, suggesting that
    UA induced a BECN1-independent autophagic pathway in TC-1 cells.', 'Therefore,
    for those human cancer cells that are resistant to drugs that induce caspase-dependent
    apoptotic cell death owing to the deletion of BECN1, UA may still be effective.',
  'Furthermore, the regulation of autophagy via Atg5 can increase the levels of cell
    death and enhance the efficiency of UA.', 'Thus, the combination of drugs that
    induces apoptotic cell death and UA may yield synergistic clinical benefit in
    cancer treatment.', These results also suggest that UA may be a potent complementary
    therapy for cancers that are resistant to caspase-dependent apoptotic cell death.,
  'In summary, our study demonstrated for the first time that UA induced autophagy
    in TC-1 cervical cancer cells through PI3-K signaling pathways that have been
    previously implicated in the control of the induction of autophagy.', 'The autophagy
    induction is a major mechanism for UA-induced TC-1 cell death, and UA-induced
    autophagy is dependent on Atg5, but not BECN1.', This new anticancer mechanism
    of UA suggests that UA may be a potent complementary drug for cancer treatment
    when patients are unresponsive to drugs that induce caspase-dependent apoptotic
    cell death., The authors thank Professor Noboru Mizushima  for donating the Atg5+/+
