text: ['Almonds are known to have a number of nutritional benefits, including cholesterol-lowering
    effects and protection against diabetes.', 'They are also a good source of minerals
    and vitamin E, associated with promoting health and reducing the risk for chronic
    disease.', For this study we investigated the potential prebiotic effect of almond
    seeds in vitro by using mixed fecal bacterial cultures., 'Two almond products,
    finely ground almonds  and defatted finely ground almonds, were subjected to a
    combined model of the gastrointestinal tract which included in vitro gastric and
    duodenal digestion, and the resulting fractions were subsequently used as substrates
    for the colonic model to assess their influence on the composition and metabolic
    activity of gut bacteria populations.', 'FG significantly increased the populations
    of bifidobacteria and Eubacterium rectale, resulting in a higher prebiotic index  than
    was found for the commercial prebiotic fructooligosaccharides  at 24 h of incubation.',
  No significant differences in the proportions of gut bacteria groups were detected
    in response to DG., The increase in the numbers of Eubacterium rectale during
    fermentation of FG correlated with increased butyrate production., 'In conclusion,
    we have shown that the addition of FG altered the composition of gut bacteria
    by stimulating the growth of bifidobacteria and Eubacterium rectale.']
