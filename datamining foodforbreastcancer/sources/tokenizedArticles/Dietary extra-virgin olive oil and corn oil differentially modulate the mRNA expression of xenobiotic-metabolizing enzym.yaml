text: [High extra-virgin olive oil  and corn oil diets differentially modulate experimental
    mammary carcinogenesis., We have investigated their influence on the initiation
    stage through the modulation of the expression of xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes  in
    the liver and the mammary gland., 'Female SpragueDawley rats were fed a low-fat,
    high corn oil, or high EVOO  diet from weaning and gavaged with 7,12-dimethylbenzanthracene.',
  'The HCO diet increased the mRNA levels of the phase I enzymes CYP1A1, CYP1A2 and,
    to a lesser extent, CYP1B1, in the liver.', The Aryl hydrocarbon receptor  seemed
    to be involved in this upregulated CYP1 expression., 'However, a slight trend
    toward an increase in the mRNA levels of the phase II enzymes GSTP1 and NQO1 was
    observed with the HOO diet.', 'At least in the case of GSTP1, this effect was
    linked to an increased Nrf2 transactivation activity.', 'This different regulation
    of the XMEs expression led, in the case of the HCO diet, to a balance between
    the production of active carcinogenic compounds and their inactivation tilted
    toward phase I, which would stimulate DMBA-induced cancer initiation, whereas
    the HOO diet was associated with a slower phase I metabolism accompanied by a
    faster phase II detoxification, thus reducing the output of the active compounds
    to the target tissues.', 'In the mammary gland, the differential effects of diets
    may be conditioned by the state of cell differentiation, sexual maturity, and
    hormone metabolism.']
