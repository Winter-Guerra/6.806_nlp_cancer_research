text: ['Green tea, obtained from the leaves of Camellia sinensis  Kuntze, is largely
    used for its potential health benefits such as reduction in risk of cardiovascular
    diseases and weight loss.', 'Nevertheless, it is suspected to induce liver damage.',
  'Present work reviews the hepatic adverse reactions associated with GT-based herbal
    supplements, published by the end of 2008 to March 2015.', 'A systematic research
    was carried out on PubMed, MedlinePlus, Scopus and Google Scholar databases, without
    any language restriction.', 'Moreover, some accessible databases on pharmacovigilance
    or phytovigilance were consulted.', The causality assessment was performed using
    the CIOMS/RUCAM score., Nineteen cases of hepatotoxicity related to the consumption
    of herbal products containing GT were identified., The hepatic reactions involved
    mostly women ; the kind of liver damage was generally classified as hepatocellular.,
  The causality assessment between consumption of herbal preparation and hepatic reaction
    resulted as probable in eight cases and as possible in eleven cases., 'In seven
    cases, patients used preparations containing only GT, while twelve reactions involved
    patients who took multicomponent preparations.', 'The reactions induced by GT
    had a generally long latency, and the outcome was always resolution, with recovery
    time of 64.6  17.78 days.', 'On the contrary, liver injury associated with MC
    had a shorter latency  and was more serious in four cases that required liver
    transplantation and, when resolution occurred, the recovery time was longer.',
  'MC preparations contained numerous other components, many of which are suspected
    to induce liver damage, so it is difficult to ascribe the toxicity to one specific
    component, e.g., GT.', 'Present data confirm a certain safety concern with GT,
    even if the number of hepatic reactions reported is low considering the great
    extent of use of this supplement.', 'The mechanism of GT hepatotoxicity remains
    unclear, but factors related to the patient are becoming predominant.', 'A major
    safety concern exists when GT is associated with other ingredients that can interact
    between them and with GT, enhancing the risk of liver damage.', Patients should
    be discouraged from using herbal or dietary supplements containing complex mixtures
    and should be encouraged to use herbal and dietary supplement possibly under supervision
    of healthcare professionals., 'Green tea Camellia sinensis Catechins Epigallocatechin
    gallate Hepatotoxicity Herbal supplements


    Antonella Di Sotto and Annabella Vitalone have contributed equally to this article.',
  'Tea is a universal beverage consumed by billions of people around the world since
    thousands of years owing to its aroma, taste and health-promoting properties.',
  It is prepared by infusion from the leaves of Camellia sinensis  Kuntze., 'Depending
    on the postharvest processing treatment, particularly the degree of fermentation,
    several commercial types of tea can be obtained, which differ in terms of flavor,
    color and composition.', The term fermentation refers to how much a tea is allowed
    to undergo enzymatic oxidation., 'Classically, the most known types of tea are:
    black tea, oolong tea  and green tea.', 'To produce black tea, leaves are allowed
    to wither for about 20 h, rolled, fermented in a humid atmosphere and then dried
    with hot air.', Oolong tea is only partially fermented., 'To produce green tea,
    freshly harvested leaves are stabilized by dry heating or steaming to inactivate
    polyphenol oxidase enzymes and then rolled and dried rapidly.', 'More recently,
    special attention is drawn to white tea, which is now worldwide on the market.',
  'White tea is prepared from young leaves or buds, harvested before being fully opened;
    the leaflets, covered by silvery hairs, are picked and allowed to wither lightly
    before being dried; during the withering, a very light fermentation occurs.',
  'Black tea is the type of tea most largely consumed worldwide  and is very popular
    in North America and Europe: Green tea is mainly consumed in China and Japan.',
  White tea is the rarest and the least handled tea., 'Besides methylxanthine alkaloids,
    the polyphenols are considered the major bioactive molecules of tea, among which
    are the catechins epigallocatechin-3-gallate, epicatechin, epicatechin-3-gallate  and
    epigallocatechin.', 'EGCG is the most abundant  and possesses the highest antioxidant
    potential, so it is considered the most biologically active substance.', 'The
    high catechin levels have been indicated as the base of the tea antioxidant properties
    and its protective role in pathological conditions caused by reactive oxygen species,
    such as cancer, cardiovascular and neurological diseases.', 'During fermentation,
    catechins undergo oxidization by polyphenol oxidase so they are transformed into
    theaflavins and thearubigins, condensed polymeric compounds, considered responsible
    for the typical organoleptic characteristics  of black tea.', 'Green tea is the
    major source of catechins, although it is suggested that white tea presents higher
    levels of antioxidants than green tea.', 'In the last decade, the consumption
    of tea, particularly green tea, has been largely increased for its reputed health
    benefits  even if the preventive effect of tea has not been confirmed yet.', Green
    tea use is encouraged by a myriad of Internet Web sites and by the over-the-counter
    availability of a large variety of green tea products on Internet as well as on
    health food stores., 'Based on reputed healthy properties, today green tea is
    marketed in the form of innumerable herbal supplements, whose composition differs
    largely for content in catechins.', 'As the consumption of green tea increased,
    some safety issues appeared.', 'Particularly, green tea has been associated with
    hepatotoxic reactions, mainly when used for the weight control.', 'In this context,
    a green tea preparation, Exolise, marketed as herbal supplement for weight loss,
    was withdrawn in 2003 after 13 cases of hepatotoxicity due to its consumption.',
  'After this, the US Pharmacopoeia  Dietary Supplement Information Expert Committee  systematically
    reviewed the safety information for green tea products in order to re-evaluate
    the current safety class to which these products were assigned.', 'As a result
    of this safety review, DSI EC decided to assign to green tea extract a Class 2
    safety.', 'As labelling statement was suggested, Take with food.', 'Discontinue
    use and consult a healthcare practitioner if you have a liver disorder or develop
    symptoms of liver trouble such as abdominal pain, dark urine, or jaundice.', 'However,
    after reviewing additional information, in June 2008, the DSI EC decides to defer
    approval of this cautionary labelling requirement.', 'In May 2009, Hydroxycut,
    a multi-ingredient herbal supplement containing green tea along with other components,
    had issued a public recall and a health advisory by FDA, owing to a case series
    of hepatotoxicity.', 'Despite this, other green tea-based supplements appeared
    on the market, sometimes near identically to those withdrawn and other case reports
    of liver damage after consumption of green tea appeared in the literature.', Aim
    of the present work was to review the green tea hepatotoxicity on the basis of
    the more recent literature data., 'A systematic research of case reports of hepatotoxicity
    induced by green tea and its preparations was carried out on PubMed, MedlinePlus,
    Scopus and Google Scholar databases using the key words: green tea, C. sinensis,
    catechins, epigallocatechin gallate, EGCG, polyphenols, herbal supplements, dietary
    supplements and herbal medicine.', 'Each term was matched with the key words typical
    for liver damage: hepatotoxicity, liver failure, liver injury, liver damage, hepatitis,
    hepatic necrosis, hepatic fibrosis, cirrhosis and cholestasis.', 'Moreover, some
    accessible databases on pharmacovigilance or phytovigilance such as RELIS  were
    examined.', 'The search started from November 2008  and extended to March 2015,
    without any language restriction.', 'Cases of hepatotoxicity induced by Hydroxycut
    published in this period  were not included in this review, owing to the withdrawal
    of the product from the market in July 2009; nevertheless, they have been mentioned
    in the Discussion section.', All papers selected were retrieved and carefully
    examined to perform a causality assessment between herbal supplement ingestion
    and liver injury., 'A causality assessment process that is specific for herbal-induced
    liver injury has not been developed, so a variety of scales can be used.', We
    chose the CIOMS/RUCAM score  that assigns points to specific categories., It is
    a well-standardized method used in the assessment of drug-induced liver injuries
    which has been applied to both drugs and dietary supplement., 'To classify the
    type of liver injury and then to calculate the RUCAM score, the upper normal values
    of alanine aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase  are needed.', 'However,
    in our cases the range of normal values of ALT and ALP was described only in few
    reports, so we used those reported by US National Library of MedicineNIHHealth
    Topics.', 'In our search, nineteen cases of hepatotoxicity related to the consumption
    of herbal products containing green tea were identified.', 'The hepatic reactions
    involved mostly females, between 24 and 63 years old; males  were between 16 and
    76 years old.', The characteristics of cases are reported in Table 1., "Clinical

    LC1 anti-liver cytosol type 1 antibodies\n\nGreen tea preparations used by the
    patients who experienced a reaction consisted of green tea alone, as infusion
    or dried leaves, or its derivatives.", 'In most preparations, green tea extracts
    were associated with other components that consist of botanicals, pure phytochemicals,
    vitamins, amino acids, alkaloids, minerals and others.', 'The reason for use of
    green tea products, reported in 15/19 cases, dealt mainly with weight loss  and
    hair loss, followed by energy or well-being enhancement and beverage; in one case,
    a green tea infusion was used even to treat constipation.', The duration of treatment
    was very variable being between 2 days and more than 1 year., 'The latency of
    the reaction varied within a broad range too: from 14 days to more than 1 year.',
  'All patients presented symptoms that required hospitalization; they consist of
    jaundice, malaise, fatigue, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, fever; sometimes
    discoloration of stool and urine and pruritus were present.', 'The reaction occurred
    generally during the treatment, but in two cases, it happened 14 days after the
    treatment discontinuation.', 'Laboratory investigations, reported as mean  standard
    error, showed liver enzyme levels several times higher than the upper level of
    normal ; particularly, ALT were from 3.6 to 96 times ULN  and AST from 4.9 to
    99 times ULN.', ALP values ranged from normal  to 5.5 times ULN., 'The kind of
    liver damage was classified, according to Danan and Benichou, as hepatocellular
    in 16/19 cases and as cholestatic in two cases.', 'In case 16 the type of liver
    injury could not be classified as hepatocellular or cholestatic, owing to the
    lack of ALP value in the report.', 'However, the causality assessment resulted
    as possible, when the liver injury was considered both as hepatocellular and cholestatic.',
  Liver biopsy was performed in 15/19 cases and highlighted mostly necrosis  and inflammatory
    cell infiltrates., 'In some cases, cholestasis was pointed out.', Slight fibrosis
    was present occasionally., Serologic tests for viral hepatitis  when performed
    were always negative., 'Occasionally, on the basis of specific tests, other diseases
    excluded were hereditary haemochromatosis, Wilson disease, Leishmania infection  and
    Toxoplasma infection.', 'Serology for autoimmune hepatitis, particularly assay
    for ANA, AMA ASMA and anti-LKM, was within normal values, except for a positivity
    for ANA antibodies in cases 10  and 12, for ASMA in cases 17  and 19  and for
    ANCA in case 19.', 'In most cases, consumption of green tea was associated with
    other medications consisting both in conventional drugs  and in dietary supplements.',
  'Pathological conditions predisposing the subject to liver injury were generally
    excluded, except for a case with previous hepatic steatosis.', Risk factors related
    to the age were present in six subjects., Abuse of alcohol was always excluded.,
  Outcome consisted mostly in resolution but four cases of liver transplantation occurred.,
  'Recovery occurred mainly between 20 and 90 days, but rapid  and long-lasting  times
    of recovery were also observed.', 'In some cases, corticoid therapy was required
    to obtain resolution.', Rechallenge was never reported., 'The causality assessment
    between consumption of herbal preparation and hepatic reaction, carried out according
    to CIOMS/RUCAM method, resulted as probable in eight cases  and as possible in
    11 cases.', 'It is obvious that when herbal supplement contained green tea in
    association with other components, the causality assessment concerned the whole
    supplement and not green tea only.', Consumption of herbal dietary supplements
    has become a major heath trend in wealthy societies worldwide., 'A recent survey  carried
    out in six European countries  found an usage prevalence rate of herbal supplements
    of 18.8 %, being the majority of consumers educated to medium level.', The rising
    popularity of herbal dietary supplements probably originates from an increased
    awareness of consumers toward well-being and health in general and then from the
    desire to prevent illness by an optimal nutritional status., A relevant reason
    for the favor these products enjoy with the public is the belief that they are
    not only effective but also safe because herbal remedies are of natural origin
    and used for long time., 'This lack of criticism is surprising, particularly as
    there is no shortage of criticism for conventional medicine.', 'Actually, the
    efficacy and safety of herbal dietary supplements are questionable for several
    reasons, first of all because current regulatory framework for natural products
    differs from that of conventional drugs in that nonclinical and clinical assessments
    of safety and efficacy are not required to market herbal products, so safety concerns
    are not known until postmarketing surveillance.', 'In recent years, there is an
    increasing evidence of adverse reactions to these products.', Herbal supplements
    are prone to induce toxicity firstly because of their complexity and variability.,
  'They originate from a living organism  by different steps: harvesting, drying,
    processing, etc.', 'From a single plant, very different products can be obtained
    depending on time of harvesting, part of plant used, drying method and extraction
    procedure.', These parameters likely cause batch-to-batch and product-to-product
    variability in the final product., 'Other open questions are represented by plant
    misidentification, contamination and adulteration.', 'Consequently, quality aspects
    of herbal products should be considered in evaluating their safety and, eventually,
    their adverse affects.', 'The liver, by its nature, is an organ prone to suffer
    toxic effects of xenobiotics.', 'Among drug-induced liver injury cases, herbal
    and dietary supplements  are the second most common cause.', 'In the USA, reports
    from the Drug-Induced Liver Injury Network  indicate that HDS are responsible
    for an increasing proportion of hepatotoxicity cases.', 'Among 109 patients in
    whom HDS were implicated in their liver injury, most  used products intended for
    bodybuilding, followed by products for weight loss.', 'Green tea, besides its
    use as beverage, is one of the most widely used herbal supplements.', 'Some studies
    have shown the potential health benefit associated with green tea consumption,
    but in the literature, there are also several reports of adverse hepatic reactions
    associated with green tea.', 'In our previous review, 34 cases of hepatotoxicity
    associated with green tea preparations were identified, including six cases related
    to Exolise, which had been withdrawn from the market owing to its hepatotoxicity.',
  Present search identified 19 cases of suspected hepatotoxicity associated with the
    consumption of green tea-based products., 'The assessment causality, carried out
    by the CIOMS/RUCAM method, resulted in most cases  as possible and in 42 % as
    probable.', Sometimes the causality level assigned by us on the basis of data
    described in case reports resulted lower than that assigned by authors; this fact
    can be due to the different opinion among evaluators that remains a concern with
    all causality assessment methods., 'However, often the score was penalized by
    the lack of sufficient information in case reports; just as an example, for case
    1, authors describe only results about markers for HBV and HCV without data regarding
    HAV, HEV and CMV.', 'In the absence of these data, the CIOMS/RUCAM score is 5
    so the causality assessment results as possible; conversely, the exclusion of
    the above viral infections would bring the score to 7 and the causality assessment
    would result as probable.', 'Furthermore, in several cases, the course of liver
    parameters is not reported: Also this lack decreases the score and then the causality
    level.', 'Finally, among non-drug causes, CIOMS/RUCAM score takes into account
    also an acute hypotension history but this event is never mentioned in cases reports,
    so it has been considered as not excluded and the score is reduced.', These facts
    highlight the importance of comprehensively evaluating an adverse reaction and
    of reporting it correctly., 'As already specified, seven cases  regarded use of
    preparations containing only green tea or its derivatives, while twelve reactions  involved
    multicomponent preparations.', This point has to be kept in mind to avoid misleading
    conclusions., 'In fact, in a multicomponent preparation, each ingredient has its
    own pharmacological and toxicological profile, inducing desired and undesired
    effects; moreover, it can interact both with other components of the mixture and
    with conventional drugs possibly co-administered, leading to unpredictable effects.',
  'In these cases, as stated, the causality assessment between herbal supplement and
    reaction deals with the whole supplement, not with its single ingredients.', 'In
    line with this consideration, the cases involving preparations containing only
    green tea will be discussed separately from those involving multicomponent preparations.',
  'As regards patients who took only green tea, they consumed infusions  or its derivatives
    such as micronized powder  and decaffeinated extract.', 'The latency of the reaction
    ranged from ten to more than 365 days, being mean  SE 179.1  58.95, and the outcome
    was always resolution, with recovery time of 5120 days.', Clinical conditions
    predisposing to liver damage were absent except for case 2 in which a preexisting
    hepatic steatosis occurred., 'Four patients  were taking other medications, some
    of which are known to be potentially hepatotoxic, among these are anastrozole,
    oral contraceptives, irbesartan, ramipril  and atorvastatin.', 'However, in all
    cases, these medications were consumed since almost 2 years without any side effect,
    so they cannot be directly related to the hepatic adverse event.', 'In some cases,
    it has been hypothesized that the consumption of green tea triggered the reaction
    as, for example, for the autoimmune-like hepatitis reported by Gallo et al..',
  'In this case, the patient, who consumed irbesartan and a combination of gestodene
    and 17-ethynilestradiol, carried various genetic variants, being heterozygote
    for the CYP3A4 gene IVS10 + 12G &gt; A polymorphism  and for the UGT1A1 gene22
    polymorphism, associated with a decreased enzymatic activity; moreover, he was
    homozygote for the UGTA922 polymorphism, associated with a reduced transcriptional
    activity.', 'It was hypothesized that these genetic variants of his hepatic metabolism
    made the patient particularly susceptible to oxidative stress possibly induced
    by the high doses of catechins, particularly by EGCG.', 'Moreover, the peculiar
    hepatic metabolism of the patient increased the concentration of oral contraceptives
    intermediates so favoring the haptenization of liver proteins and leading to the
    development of an autoimmune hepatitis, supported by a positivity of ANA antibodies
    and by the normalization of liver function tests after steroid therapy with prednisone.',
  'On the whole, based on the temporal relationship between the consumption of green
    tea and onset of reaction  and the positive rechallenge and the general absence
    of non-drug-related causes, these data point green tea as the main cause of the
    hepatic reactions reported.', 'Nevertheless, only in some cases, a laboratory
    analysis of the product ingested was carried out to exclude the presence of contaminants,
    a recurrent problem with herbal products.', 'Considering the reactions that involved
    multicomponent preparations of green tea, in some cases, their composition appears
    very complex owing to the presence, besides green tea, of several herbal ingredients,
    minerals, amino acids and others.', The doses of green tea active constituents
    taken by patients were reported only in four cases and were expressed as EGCG  or
    as polyphenols., 'The latency of the reaction, expressed as mean  SE, was 44.7  13.85
    days.', 'When the outcome consisted in resolution, the recovery time was 118.9  38.79
    days.', The most striking datum is the severity of reactions in that all cases
    of liver transplantation  occurred after consumption of multicomponent preparations.,
  One of the patients who underwent liver transplantation  consumed SlimQuick; the
    product had been taken for 2 days., 'Several other causes for hepatitis  were
    excluded; a toxicity due to metoprolol consumed by the patient was excluded too,
    owing to incompatible time of onset.', 'The daily dosage of catechins taken by
    the patient, according to the manufacturer, was 270 mg: This dosage is considered
    as safe, even if a quality control of the supplement has not been performed so
    the content of catechins has not been checked.', 'However, it has to be considered
    that the supplement was taken fasting, a condition that increases the bioavailability
    of catechins  and then their possible toxicity.', 'Moreover, components of SlimQuick
    other than green tea are to be considered.', 'For most of them, hepatotoxicity
    issues have not been reported; however, a speculation about Polygonum cuspidatum
    Siebold &amp; Zucc.', can be made., This medicinal plant is widely used in traditional
    Chinese medicine along with the species P. multiflorum Thunb., ; the latter is
    known to be involved in numerous cases of hepatotoxicity., 'The chemical composition
    of these two species is similar, the major compounds being stilbenes and anthraquinone
    derivatives.', 'They can be differentiated by identification of their stilbene
    derivatives; however, some confusion exists within the pharmaceutical market regarding
    P. multiflorum and P. cuspidatum, so we cannot exclude that in our case, P. multiflorum
    had been used instead of P. cuspidatum.', 'In the other case of liver injury after
    SlimQuick, several causes for hepatitis  were excluded too, as well as a toxicity
    due to the concomitant medication with tetracycline, owing to the lack of consistent
    documentation and the incompatible time of onset.', 'In this case, the patient
    was heterozygous for alpha-1 antitrypsin and the alpha-1 antitrypsin MZ phenotype
    has been suggested, which might be a risk factor for chronic liver disease or
    liver failure.', The second case of liver transplantation  regarded a 35-year-old
    woman who took Saba Appetite Control and Energy  for 2 days., 'She was also taking
    sertraline, norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol for 3 years, without any
    recent change in doses; all other causes of hepatitis were ruled out.', 'Besides
    green tea, the supplement ACE, in the previous formula, contained geranium extract
    also known as 1,3-dimethylpentylamine or DMAA.', 'In July 2013, FDA banned DMAA-containing
    dietary supplements and any marketing practices promoting them, following several
    adverse reactions including liver failure.', 'Many DMAA-containing supplements
    were reformulated as DMAA free; however, geranium extract is still present in
    some ACE supplements marketed online.', 'In light of this, we do not know which
    was the exact composition of the supplement taken by the patient, because it is
    not described in the case report.', 'Among ACE ingredients, chromium is also reported.',
  'Trivalent chromium compounds are used to enhance weight loss due to purported effects
    of decreasing body fat and increasing basal rate ; however, there have been reports
    of chromium hepatotoxicity, due to dietary supplements.', 'In conclusion, which
    is the exact hepatotoxic agent in Saba Appetite Control and Energy  and whether
    a possible contamination with DMAA played a role in liver toxicity remain unclear.',
  The third case of liver transplantation  regarded a young 28-year-old female bodybuilder.,
  'This woman, besides the green tea-based supplement Lipolyz, took several other
    dietary supplements, among which is Somalyz.', 'Both these supplements contain
    usnic acid, a substance derived from the lichen Usnea barbata.', 'Usnic acid is
    a component of dietary supplements promoted for weight loss and has been associated
    with several levels of liver damage, ranging from mild hepatitis to liver failure
    requiring transplantation.', 'After numerous reports of liver toxicity related
    to the ingestion of dietary supplements containing usnic acid, the FDA in 2001
    issued a warning about one such supplement, LipoKinetix.', 'Usnic acid acts as
    an uncoupler of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation leading to an increase
    in fat metabolism and desired weight loss; however, with this effect, there is
    a concomitant increase in oxidative stress and cellular injury, resulting in loss
    of mitochondrial respiratory control and inhibition of ATP synthesis.', 'Usnic
    acid showed also to be a potent inhibitor of CYP2C19 and CYP2C9 with less potent
    inhibitor of CYP2C8 and CYP2C18, so having a significant potential to interact
    with other medication.', 'In this case, usnic acid may have been predominantly
    responsible for the liver damage even if its effect was possibly perpetuated by
    other components of the mixtures, among green tea.', The last case of liver transplantation  involved
    a 25-year-old man who took the dietary supplement Exilis., 'He had neither other
    medications nor other clinical conditions possibly responsible for liver failure,
    so the dietary supplement remains the main suspect.', 'Exiliscontains, besides
    green tea, Garcinia cambogia, Gymnema sylvestre, chromium chelate, conjugated
    linoleic and others.', 'G. cambogia has been hypothesized to have a synergistic
    hepatotoxic effect with montelukast in a fatal case of liver failure  and in laboratory
    experiments has been shown to increase hepatic collagen accumulation, lipid peroxidation
    and mRNA levels of genes related to oxidative stress, as well as plasma alanine
    transaminase and aspartate transaminase levels.', G. sylvestre has been reported
    to induce hepatitis too., Possible hepatotoxicity of chromium compounds has been
    described above., 'Conjugated linoleic acid, an ingredient included in several
    weight loss dietary supplements because reputed as having some potential benefit
    for weight loss, has been recently involved in two cases of hepatotoxicity, one
    of which required liver transplantation.', 'Last but not least, we cannot overlook
    the fact that most of the components of Exilis  are identical to those of Hydroxycut,
    the above-mentioned food supplement recalled by FDA in 2009.', 'In this context,
    it is worth to emphasize that after Hydroxycut recall, other cases of hepatotoxicity
    involving this supplement have been published.', Seventeen cases were reported
    by Fong et al., '; they probably were collected before Hydroxycut recall; in any
    case, it deserved to be mentioned that four out of them required liver transplantation.',
  'A further case, reported by Sharma et al., involved a 19-year-old man who took
    the product for fat burning and muscle building.', 'More recently, Kaswala et
    al.', reported the case of a 27-year-old man who was studying to be a physical
    trainer and had been taking Hydroxycut along with other supplements., 'Finally,
    Haimowitz et al.', described a fulminant liver failure in a 23-year-old man after
    consumption of Hydroxycut for 2 months., 'In this case, the supplement was considered
    to be the cause of initial liver injury in the setting of an underlying porphyria.',
  'All these cases about Hydroxycut highlight, besides the lack of information on
    the safety of herbal supplements, the fact that, even after withdrawal from the
    market, they are easily available through the other distribution channels as,
    for example, online sales.', 'Returning to our cases, four  out of 12 involved
    catechin-based supplements taken to counteract the hair loss.', 'The two supplements
    involved in these reactions had a very similar composition consisting in catechins
    from green tea and grape seeds, taurine, zinc gluconate.', 'In cases 6, 7 and
    8, the causal relationship, according to CIOMS/RUCAM scale, resulted probable
    because of the temporal relationship between supplement consumption and reaction
    and the absence of other causes.', 'In particular, patients 6 and 7 had no other
    medications while patient 7 had been taking acetyl salicylic acid and fenofibrate
    but for years, without any reaction.', 'In case 18, the causality was possible
    owing to fact that the patient had been taking paracetamol as concomitant drug.',
  'Taurine and zinc gluconate are not suspected of liver damage to our knowledge,
    so catechins and the other components of the green tea and grape seeds remain
    the main responsible.', The case 9  regarded a 16-year-old Hispanic male who was
    taking several dietary supplements as a part of an unsupervised weight loss planning.,
  'The patient was consuming the supplement Green Tea Fat Burner, whose components,
    other than green tea, are not known as causing hepatotoxicity; on the contrary,
    some of them are considered to possess hepatoprotective effects.', 'However, the
    young man was consuming also other supplements such as Nopal, an extract from
    cactus of Opuntia genus, used as source of dietary fibers in the management of
    overweight, GNC Mega Men Sport, a complex mixture containing numerous vitamins,
    minerals among which are chromium, branched chain amino acids, l-carnitine, lycopene,
    choline, zeaxanthin, astaxanthin, alpha-lipoic acid and others and, finally, whey
    protein.', 'The latter, even if reputed a hepatoprotective substance, has been
    shown to cause liver damage in humans and in laboratory experiments.', 'Moreover,
    chromium has been suspected of hepatotoxicity as already stated.', 'So, on the
    whole, it is very difficult to establish which is the component responsible for
    the liver injury in this subject, but probably a unique culprit cannot be found.',
  Case 12  deals with a 45-year-old woman with hypothyroidism and systemic sclerosis
    who had hepatitis after taking the preparation Euforia., 'The patient was positive
    for antinuclear antibodies ANA, suggesting an autoimmune hepatitis; however, ANA
    are present in up to 98 % of systemic sclerosis patients ; authors concluded that
    the mechanism of the liver injury was unknown.', 'As regards the components of
    the supplement, other than green tea, possibly involved in liver damage, aloe  is
    one of defendants in that it has been associated with several cases of hepatitis.',
  'Anthraquinones, the chemical components of aloe, are reputed toxic that lead to
    the production of oxygen-derived free radicals that eventually induce apoptosis.',
  'Goji berry, the fruit of Lycium barbarum L., has been recently involved in hepatitis
    too.', 'Finally, many reports of suspected liver injuries from noni  are reported,
    even if hepatotoxicity of noni juice remains speculative.', 'In this scenario,
    which component of Euforia induced liver injury remains to be established.', The
    case 17  involved a 55-year-old man with a history of psoriatic arthritis who
    took Lotus-f3., 'This is the unique published report of hepatotoxicity from this
    supplement; however, other unpublished cases are reported in Norwegian Adverse
    Drug Reaction database.', 'According to the authors, the content of green tea
    in Lotus-f3 had been reduced just after the reports of adverse effects.', 'Non-drug-related
    cases of hepatitis were excluded; conversely, the patient was taking etanercept,
    an antagonist of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, which is used widely in severe forms
    of rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis.', 'This drug has been associated with some
    cases of drug-induced liver injury ; however, in our case, after resolution of
    the reaction, the drug was reintroduced and the dose was increased, without any
    adverse effect.', 'None of the components of Lotus-f3, other than green tea, are
    reported to be toxic to liver, except for chromium so, probably, green tea and
    chromium are the main suspected components.', 'Present data, particularly those
    from green tea alone, confirm that a certain safety concern with green tea exists.',
  'The number of hepatic reactions reported is low if we consider the great extent
    of use of green tea, nevertheless, has to be taken into account that there is
    a tendency for underreporting the ingestion of herbal supplements by patients
    and the magnitude of their use and, as a consequence, their adverse reactions
    are underrecognized by physicians.', The liver damage occurs mostly after ingestion
    of green tea in high quantity or for long periods of time and the pattern of liver
    injury is almost always of hepatocellular type., 'In this context, it has also
    to be noted that the green tea liver injury involves mostly females.', 'This can
    be due to the more wide use made by this gender of herbal supplements, particularly
    those for body weight control, but it is known that females appear to be at higher
    risk of liver injury from some medications.', Moreover it is surprising that a
    significant portion of subjects who experienced hepatitis after green tea  were
    Hispanic., 'An intriguing hypothesis is a genetic predisposition, even if other
    causes as prevalence of overweight among this population  or a wider use of green
    tea by this population cannot be excluded.', It has to be noted that a genetic
    basis has been hypothesized in some of our cases., 'If a safety concern with green
    tea exists, a bigger safety concern exists when green tea is associated with other
    ingredients.', 'People seeking to remain in good health, as well as patients seeking
    self-medicate, oftentimes consume a variety of herbal and other type of dietary
    supplements in addition to green tea thinking that if one is good two is better.',
  'On the contrary, present data clearly show that green tea hepatotoxicity is greatly
    enhanced when it is consumed in association with other herbal or dietary ingredients.',
  'Comparing the adverse events induced by only green tea-based preparations with
    those by multicomponent mixtures, it is apparent that in general, the first ones
    have a latency that is generally longer and the damage is generally milder because
    outcome was always resolution.', 'On the contrary, liver injury associated with
    multicomponent preparations had a shorter latency and was more serious in that
    resulted in four cases of liver transplantation and, when resolution occurred,
    the recovery time was longer.', 'As above described, almost all multicomponent
    green tea preparations contain ingredients other than green tea which are suspected
    to induce liver injury : These can act synergistically between them and with green
    tea, so enhancing the risk of liver damage.', 'Moreover considering the possible
    quality problems related to a single herbal drug, it is obvious that more a mixture
    is complex, the greater the possibility of lack of quality.', 'In addition, in
    a multicomponent herbal preparation, there are hundreds of molecules that may
    interact pharmacologically in a manner totally unpredictable with serious health
    risk.', 'Finally, we cannot overlook the fact that often these products are used
    to increase the physical performance or in body building.', It is known that physical
    exercise results in oxidative stress and free radical-mediated damage to tissues.,
  'For this reason, body builders use supplements containing antioxidants, such as
    green tea.', 'Always thinking that if one is good two is better, they consume
    several other antioxidant-based supplements such as, for example, Mega Men Sport
    that contains, besides green tea, vitamins C and E, selenium, lycopene, lutein,
    zeaxanthin, astaxanthin, etc, so exposing themselves to heath risks because it
    is equally well known that an excessive intake of antioxidants may promote oxidative
    stress  inducing several kind of damages among which is liver injury.', The popularity
    of herbal remedies is increasing worldwide., 'Being marketed as dietary supplements,
    they are not subjected to the evaluation for safety and efficacy so the harmful
    effects are reported only after they are placed on the market.', 'Herbal supplements
    are emerging as a major cause of drug-induced liver injury, supplements used for
    body building and weight loss are the most common types implicated in the damage.',
  'There is general agreement that herbal supplements hepatotoxicity represents a
    major diagnostic challenge, since markers for its diagnosis are not commonly available
    and there are only a few agents in which common and repeating patterns of injury
    have been observed.', 'Moreover, a causality assessment process that is specific
    for herbal-induced liver injury has not been developed, although a preliminary
    attempt was made by DILIN.', 'On the whole, the cases here described show a positive
    trend in reporting herbal hepatotoxicity since numerous cases were published in
    2014 ; this fact may depend on an increasing consumption of green tea products
    or herbal supplements in general, or an increasing attention by healthcare professionals
    to the safety of herbal supplements and, as consequence, an increasing reporting.',
  'In previous cases of hepatotoxicity, green tea preparations were mostly used as
    slimming supplements, in cases here described weight loss was the reason of use
    in the minority of cases and, surprisingly, sometimes green tea preparations were
    taken to counteract hair loss.', This shows that use of these preparations is
    changing and spreading in different fields., 'Use of green tea infusion can be
    considered as safe when consumed as a beverage in normal quantity, provided that
    quality concerns and other risk factors do not exist; nevertheless, an idiosyncratic
    reaction remains always possible.', 'When using green tea derivatives such as
    extracts, safety concerns can rise, depending on the type of preparation and the
    dose of active components.', 'In some extracts, EGCG content can reach up to 95
    %: Such a product cannot be still named green tea, it is a pure substance, so
    we cannot rely on its long-lasting use as safety warranty.', Use of multicomponent
    preparations appears much more dangerous with respect to green tea alone., Physician
    and patient awareness remains central to the early identification of herbal toxicity.,
  Clinicians should ask their patients about consumption of herbal products and patients
    should be advised about possible adverse effects and encouraged to report them
    as soon as possible., 'Whenever an adverse reaction occurs, attempts to obtain
    the suspected product should be made, in order to analyze it and so exclude any
    problem of quality.', Patients should be encouraged to use herbal and dietary
    supplements possibly under supervision of healthcare professionals., 'Healthcare
    professionals should be encouraged to report adverse effects of herbal supplements
    in order to implement their knowledge, to collect signals and, when necessary,
    to take regulatory measures.', A., 'Di Sotto and A. Vitalone were supported by
