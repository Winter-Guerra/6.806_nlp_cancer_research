text: [There is currently much interest in phytochemicals as bioactive molecules of
    food., Functional foods are an emerging field in food science due to their increasing
    popularity among health conscious consumers., 'Flaxseed is cultivated in many
    parts of world for fiber, oil as well as for medicinal purposes and also as nutritional
    product.', 'In this review, nutrients, anti-nutrients, functional properties,
    processing, metabolism and health benefits of bioactive molecules viz., essential
    fatty acids, lignans and dietary fiber of flaxseed are discussed.', 'Flaxseed
    Functional properties Nutritional quality Processing Alpha-linolenic acid Dietary
    fiber Lignans Health benefits


    Flax  belonging to family Lineaceae, is a blue flowering annual herb that produces
    small flat seeds varying from golden yellow to reddish brown color.', Flaxseed
    possesses crispy texture and nutty taste., Flaxseed is also known as linseed and
    these terms are used interchangeably., Flaxseed is often used to describe flax
    when consumed by humans while linseed denotes when it is used specifically for
    industrial applications., Almost all parts of linseed plant are utilized for various
    purposes., Seed contains oil which after refining is used for edible purpose.,
  The stem yields fiber of good quality possessing high strength and durability.,
  Humans have been consuming flaxseed since ancient times., It has been cultivated
    for fiber as well as for medicinal purposes and as nutritional product., 'Currently,
    it is cultivated in more than 50 countries, predominantly in the Northern hemisphere.',
  Canada is the worlds largest producer and exporter of flaxseeds., 'The important
    flaxseed growing countries include India, China, United States, and Ethiopia.',
  India ranks first among the leading flaxseed producing countries in terms of acreage
    accounting 23.8 % of the total and third in production contributing to 10.2 %
    of the worlds production., 'In India flaxseed is mainly cultivated in Madhya Pradesh,
    Maharashtra, Chattisgarh and Bihar.', It is interesting to know that flaxseed
    was native of India and was a staple food crop., 'In India, flaxseed is still
    being consumed as food and as well as for medicinal purposes.', It enjoys a good
    status among oilseeds because of its versatile uses., 'It has emerged as an attractive
    nutritional food because of its exceptionally high content of alpha-linolenic
    acid, dietary fiber, high quality protein and phytoestrogens.', 'Flaxseeds contain
    about 55 % ALA, 2830 % protein and 35 % fiber.', 'Flaxseed has been the focus
    of growing interest for the nutritionists and medical researchers due to its potential
    health benefits associated with its biologically active componentsALA, lignan-Secoisolariciresinol
    diglycoside  and dietary fiber.', Flaxseed is establishing importance in the worlds
    food chain as a functional food., Functional food can be defined as the food or
    food ingredients that may provide physiological benefits and helps in preventing
    and/or curing of diseases., 'Presently, flaxseed has new prospects as functional
    food because of consumers growing interest for food with superb health benefits.',
  'Owing to its excellent nutritional profile and potential health benefits, it has
    become an attractive ingredient in the diets specially designed for specific health
    benefits.', 'ALA is one of the essential polyunsaturated fatty acid and reported
    to exhibit anti-inflammatory, anti-thrombotic and anti-arrhythmic properties.',
  Nutritionists all over the world suggest incorporation of omega 3 fatty acid sources
    in the diet., Flaxseed serves as the best omega 3 fatty acid source to the non-fish
    eaters., 'Edible flaxseed products include the whole flaxseed, ground meal and
    extracted oil or mucilage.', 'These products have been proposed as nutritional
    additives in the preparation of a number of dietary items such as baked cereal
    products, ready to eat cereals, fiber bars, salad toppings, meat extenders, bread,
    muffins and spaghetti.', 'Inspite of the multiple clinical evidences of flaxseeds,
    people are still unaware about its nutritional as well as therapeutic benefits.',
  'Among the functional foods, flaxseed has emerged as a potential functional food
    being good source of alpha-linolenic acid, lignans, high quality protein, soluble
    fiber and phenolic compounds.', The composition of flaxseed is presented in Table
    1., 'Chemical composition of flaxseed depends upon growing environment, genetics
    and processing conditions.', The lipid content of flaxseed varies from 37 to 45
    g/100 g of the seed as reported by various scientists., 'Cotyledons are the major
    oil storage tissues, containing 75 % of the seed oil.', 'Flaxseed oil constitutes
    98 % triacylglycerol, phospholipids and 0.1 % free fatty acids.', On an average
    it contains 21 % protein., Majority of the protein is concentrated in the cotyledons.,
  Major protein fractions are globulin  and albumin., Nutritional value and amino
    acid profile of flaxseeds are comparable to that of soya proteins., 'Flaxseed
    protein is rich in arginine, aspartic acid and glutamic acid, while lysine is
    limiting.', 'High cysteine and methionine contents improve the antioxidant levels,
    thus helps in reducing risk of cancer.', 'The processing conditions, dehusking
    and defatting affect the protein content.', 'The defatted and dehusked meals have
    high protein content  Flaxseed proteins exhibit antifungal properties against
    Alternaria solani, Candida albicans and Aspergillus flavus.', Flaxseed is the
    richest source of phytoestrogens., The amount of secoisolariciresinol diglycoside  varies
    from 77 to 209 mg SDG/tbsp., of whole flaxseed., Flaxseed contains very low level
    of carbohydrates  and thus contributing very little to total carbohydrates intake.,
  Flaxseeds contain a good amount of phenolic compounds., These phenolic compounds
    are well known for anticancer and anti-oxidative properties., 'Basically, flaxseeds
    have three different types of phenolic compoundsphenolic acids, flavonoids and
    lignans.', 'Major phenolic acids present in defatted flaxseed are ferulic acid,
    chlorogenic acid, gallic acid.', 'Other phenolic acids include p-coumaric acid
    glucosides, hydroxycinnamic acid glucosides and 4-hydroxybenzoic acid that are
    present in low quantities.', Flavone C- and Flavone O-glycosides are the major
    flavonoids found in flaxseeds., 'It serves as a good source of minerals especially,
    phosphorous, magnesium, calcium  and has very low amount of sodium.', 'It contains
    highest amount of potassium 56009200 mg/kg among various foods and high potassium
    intake is inversely related to blood platelet aggregation, free radicals in blood
    and stroke incidence.', Flaxseed contains small amounts of water-soluble and fat-soluble
    vitamins., 'Vitamin E is present as -tocopherol, amounting to 39.5 mg/100 g. -tocopherol
    is an antioxidant providing protection to cell proteins and fat from oxidation;
    promotes sodium excretion in urine, which may help in lowering of blood pressure
    and heart disease risks and Alzheimer disease.', Flaxseeds contain anti-nutrients
    that may have adverse influence on the health and well-being of human population.,
  'Cyanogenic glycosides are the major anti-nutrients and are fractionated into linustatin,
    neolinustatin, linmarin.', 'The content of these three glycosides depend upon
    cultivar, location etc..', 'Fiber type linseed has a higher percentage of glycosides
    than the seed type, and ripe seed contains less glycoside than the immature seed.',
  Whole flaxseed contains 250550 mg/100 g cyanogenic glycoside., 'In the intestine,
    cyanogenic glycosides release hydrogen cyanide, a potent respiratory inhibitor,
    by intestinal -glycosidase that produces thiocyanates.', 'Thiocyanates interfere
    with iodine uptake by thyroid gland and long term exposure aggravates iodine-deficiency
    disorders, goiter and cretinism.', 'Cyanogenic glycosides are heat labile and
    easily destroyed by processing methods namely autoclaving, microwave roasting,
    pelleting and by certain detoxifying enzymes such as -glycosidases, releasing
    hydrogen cyanide which can be evaporated by using steam.', 'Phytic acid, another
    anti-nutrient present in flaxseed, ranges from 23 to 33 g/kg of the flaxseed meal.',
  'Phytic acid interferes with the absorption of calcium, zinc, magnesium, copper
    and iron.', 'It is a strong chelator, forming protein and mineral-phytic acid
    complexes and thus reducing their bioavailability.', Clinical studies reveal that
    flaxseed fed rats had no effect on their Zn status., Ganorkar and Jain  have also
    reviewed that flaxseed antinutrients have lesser impact on human health as compared
    to that of soyabean and canola., Linatine  has been identified as a vitamin B6
    antagonist in case of chicks., 'While in humans, flaxseeds are not found to be
    associated with vitamin B6 deficiency.', 'Trypsin inhibitors are also reported
    in flaxseed, though activity is insignificant as compared to soybean and canola
    seeds.', 'Flaxseed is considered as functional food owing to the presence of three
    main bioactive componentsalpha-linolenic acid, lignans and dietary fiber.', Alpha-linolenic
    acid is the main functional component of flaxseed., It serves as an exclusive
    source of omega-3 fatty acid in the vegetarian diets., 'Flaxseed oil is rich in
    polyunsaturated fatty acid, moderate in monounsaturated fat  and low amount of
    saturated fat.', 'It is rich in both the essential fatty acidsalpha-linolenic
    acid, and linolenic acid.', 'Fatty acids are termed as essential because both
    they are required by the body but body cannot synthesize them, therefore need
    to be supplied in the diet.', Human body lacks the enzymes which are required
    for the synthesis of these essential fatty acids., Omega-3 fatty acid is known
    as essential fatty acid because humans cannot introduce a double bond beyond the
    ninth carbon from carboxyl end of fatty acid., The metabolism of essential fatty
    acids is depicted in Fig., '1.', ALA serves as the precursor for the synthesis
    of polyunsaturated fatty acidsEPA  and DHA., 'During the transformation of ALA
    into EPA and DHA, a series of fatty acids belonging to n-3 PUFA family are also
    synthesized via desaturation and elongation reactions in the presence of specific
    desaturases and elongases.', 'Similarly, linolenic acid is also synthesized using
    similar enzymatic reactions.', It has been reported that the conversion of ALA
    to EPA and DHA is not very efficient in humans and animals and there exist competition
    between both the fatty acids for the same enzymes., 'Lower order animals are known
    to have such enzymatic activities which are capable of converting n-6 fatty acid
    to n-3 fatty acids, while mammals lack such activities.', But recent research
    findings indicated that mice are the only mammals possessing the enzymes capable
    of converting n-6 fatty acid to n-3 fatty acid., 'Long chain PUFAs, EPA and DHA
    are further metabolized by the enzymes cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase to eicosanoids,
    prostaglandins, leukotrienes.', 'Among these eicosanoids, E2 series prostaglandins,
    leukotrienes B4 derived from linoleic acid are the key metabolites which are responsible
    for many inflammatory diseases like cardiovascular diseases and arthritis, while
    eicosanoids and E3 series prostaglandins derived from linolenic acid have anti-inflammatory
    responses.', 'Therefore, it is advised that human beings should consume a diet
    that contains a balanced ratio of omega-3 and omega-6 essential fatty acids.',
  The two groups of essential fatty acids compete with each other for placement within
    cell membranes., 'If the intercellular environment has a higher proportion of
    one type of fatty acid as compared to the other, it is likely that the predominant
    fatty acid will be incorporated into cell membrane, resulting in adverse effects
    in the fluidity of the cell membrane affecting cellular functions and overall
    health of the cell.', 'If there is an equal proportion of both the essential fatty
    acid in the intercellular environment, there is selective preference for omega-3
    fatty acid.', 'Both these fatty acids have opposing, yet necessary, influences
    over physiological functions.', 'EPA and DHA can be converted endogenously into
    different metabolites known as resolvins, neuroprotectins and protectins.', The
    resolvins act as potent anti-inflammatory mediator., 'In particular, they function
    to limit the extent of inflammation by blocking the actions of prostanoids, and
    also by helping to clear site of inflammation from breakdown products of inflammatory
    process.', 'Resolvins and protectins promote resolution in oral, lung, kidney,
    skin, gastrointestinal and various other inflammations to maintain homeostasis
    by activating specific mechanisms.', DHA is converted into neuroprotectins which
    exhibit neuroprotective effects., 'In order to maintain good health, it is therefore
    important that both fatty acids should be present in a balanced ratio.', Fatty
    acid profiles of various oilseeds are reported in Table 2., 'It is evident from
    the data that flaxseed contains highest amount of linolenic acid followed by soybeans
    and mustard oil, while sunflower and safflower oils contain large amount of linoleic
    acid which may leads to various diseases.', 'Over the past 100 to 150 years, the
    consumption of vegetable oils from corn, sunflower seeds, safflower seeds, cottonseeds
    and soybeans has greatly increased, which resulted in drastic imbalance of the
    essential fatty acids.', 'Today, the ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acid is
    shifted to 2030:1 in western diets and the situation is even worse in case of
    Indian diets where this ratio attains a high value of 3850:1 which reveals that
    more of omega-6 fatty acids are incorporated into the cell membrane.', 'Therefore,
    the cellular functions support more of the pro-inflammatory processes than anti-inflammatory
    processes.', 'Simple dietary choices, which favour foods containing omega-3 fatty
    acids, can ameliorate this imbalance.', 'The recommended ratio of omega-6 to omega-3
    fatty acids may be in the range of 4:1 to 10:1, and omega-6 and omega-3 fatty
    acid intakes should account for at least 3 and 0.5 % of total energy intake, respectively.',
  'These variations in the ratio of fatty acids may be considered as a deciding factor
    for the development of therapeutic doses for prevention of colorectal cancer,
    asthma and rheumatoid arthritis.', 'A large number of clinical studies have recognized
    the tremendous potential of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids against inflammatory
    mediators like prostaglandins E2, leukotriene B4, TNF-, interleukin, and cytokines.',
  'These clinical studies revealed that n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids are helpful
    in prevention of coronary heart diseases, atherosclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis
    and asthma.', Daily intake of 3 g EPA and DHA for more than 12 weeks was found
    to be effective in reducing the inflammation of rheumatoid arthritis., It has
    also been reported that the consumption of omega-3 dietary supplements lead to
    significant reduction of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs., Flaxseed oil supplementation
    for about 4 weeks resulted in protecting the mice against Streptococcus pneumonia
    infection., 'Flaxseed and its oil reduces the growth of tumors at the later stage
    of carcinogenesis; whereas, mammalian lignan precursor exert the greatest inhibitory
    effect on the growth of new tumors.', The role of flaxseed oil in tumors prevention
    is attributed to its high alpha-linolenic acid., The fatty acid composition of
    the tumors revealed higher incorporation of alpha-linolenic acid which in turn
    resulted in suppression of the growth of the tumor cells., Flaxseed possesses
    antioxidant and hepatoprotective properties., Several studies advocated the cholesterol
    lowering benefits of flaxseed meal., A study on hypercholesterolemic rats fed
    on flaxseed chutney supplemented diet  revealed significant reduction in LDL cholesterol
    and total serum cholesterol and no change in HDL cholesterol., 'In CCl4 intoxicated
    rats, lipid peroxidation products were neutralized by flaxseed lignans.', Several
    clinical studies showed that EPA and DHA play a major role in reducing depression
    symptoms., 'During depression or stress proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-,
    interferon gamma etc.', are produced., Increased of n-6 fatty acid to n-3 fatty
    acid ratio may lead to the production of proinflammatory cytokines which causes
    depression and mood swings in elderly persons., 'Lignans are phytoestrogens, which
    are abundantly available in fiber rich plants, cereals, legumes, vegetables  fruits,
    berries, tea and alcoholic beverages.', 'Flaxseed contains about 75800 times more
    lignans than cereal grains, legumes, fruits and vegetables.', 'Secoisolariciresinol
    diglycoside  is the major lignan of flaxseed, alongwith minor contents of matairesinol,
    pinoresinol, lariciresinol and isolariciresinol.', SDG ranges from 11.7 to 24.1
    mg/g in defatted flour and 6.1 to 13.3 mg/g in whole flaxseed flour., Lignans
    are the diphenolic compounds synthesised by the coupling of two coniferyl alcohol
    residues existing in cell wall of higher plants., Secoisolariciresinol  is produced
    by acid hydrolysis of secoisolariciresinol diglycoside., Secoisolariciresinol
    diglycoside existing bound form as a complex of five secoisolariciresinol diglycoside
    residues held together by four HMGA  residues in the outer layers of the seed.,
  Structures of the flaxseed lignans complied from different sources  are presented
    in Fig., '2.', SDG is metabolized by bacteria in the colon of humans to synthesize
    mammalian lignans known as enterodiol  and enterolactone., 'In human body, the
    lignans are acted upon by the gastrointestinal microflora to release SECO, non-sugar
    moiety of SDG.', 'Further hydroxylation and demethylation by the microflora, lead
    to the production of mammalian lignan-enterodiol, which is then oxidized to give
    enterolactone.', The metabolism of flaxseed lignans is presented in Fig., '3.',
  Bacteroides as well as Clostridia have been identified to release the glucosyl moieties
    from SDG to yield SECO., 'Peptostreptococcus productus, Eubacterium callanderi,
    Eubacterium limosum and Bacteroides methylotrophicum are found to be responsible
    for carrying out demethylation reactions, while dehydroxylation reaction are carried
    out by Eubacterium lentum.', The dehydrogenation of END into ENL has been carried
    out by several Clostridia and Ruminococcus sp.., 'The END and ENL, so formed can
    be excreted in faeces or are absorbed by the human colon and enter the circulation.',
  'Epidemiological studies indicate that phytoestrogens rich diets reduce the risk
    of various hormone dependent cancers, heart diseases and osteoporosis.', 'Research
    studies also demonstrate the ability of SDG to scavenge hydroxyl free radicals
    and shown that it is a potent antioxidant Human body produces free radicals during
    the oxidation of fats, proteins and carbohydrates.', 'Free radicals damages tissues,
    membrane lipids, nucleic acids, proteins which may cause cancer, lung diseases,
    neurological diseases, premature aging and diabetes.', Anticancer activity of
    lignans is attributed to its ability to scavenge hydroxyl free radicals., 'SECO,
    SDG also play an important role in reduction of hypercholesterolemia, atherosclerosis,
    hypertension and diabetes.', Daily administration of 100 mg SDG was found to be
    effective in reducing blood cholesterol and hepatic diseases risk in moderately
    hypercholesterolemic men., Flaxseed lignans behaviour depends on biological levels
    of estrogen hormone., 'At normal levels of estrogen, it exhibit antagonistic activity,
    but in postmenopausal phase when estrogen level is low, flaxseed lignans acts
    as weak estrogen.', 'The mammalian lignans stimulate the synthesis of sex hormone
    binding globulin, which binds sex hormones and reduce their circulation in blood
    stream, and decrease their biological activity and thus reducing the risk of developing
    cancer.', These mammalian lignans are believed to act by binding to estrogen receptors
    on cell membranes in the same manner as bodys own steroids do but not as powerful
    as endogenous estrogens., 'Lignans, enterodiol and enterolactone are believed
    to be partly responsible for growth inhibition of human prostate cancer.', Flaxseed
    lignans play an important role in preventing various types of cancer specially
    the hormone sensitive ones., Flax lignans are reported to have antioxidant property
    which presumably is the main reason of the anticancer activity., The lower incidences
    of prostate and breast cancers in Asian men and women compared to European men
    and women has been speculated to be due to the higher consumption of diets rich
    in fruits and vegetables.., Various clinical studies imply that lignans prevent
    breast cancer by balancing the hormonal mechanisms., The lignans inhibit the aromatase
    activity in adipose tissue resulting in the circulation of estrogen., 'In postmenopausal
    women, lignans act as weak estrogens, while at normal estrogen levels, lignans
    act as estrogen antagonists.', Dietary flaxseed moderately lowers the serum levels
    of steroid sex hormones which are implicated in development of breast cancer in
    obese postmenopausal women., Flaxseeds serve as a good source of both soluble
    and insoluble dietary fiber., Flaxseed holds a unique place among the oilseeds
    due to presence of mucilage located in outer layers of the seed., Flaxseed mucilage
    has gained momentum due to its superb health benefits and potential functional
    properties., It contains 3545 % of fibre and two-third is insoluble and one third
    is soluble fiber., 'Insoluble fiber consists of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin.',
  Most of the soluble fiber of flaxseed appears to be the mucilage of seed coat.,
  It makes up 710 % of seed weight., Soluble fiber in the form of mucilaginous material
    consists mainly of water soluble polysaccharides; its recovery and purity vary
    with the extraction conditions., The water binding capacity of flaxseed mucilage
    is reported to be about 16003000 g of water/ 100 g of solids., High water binding
    capacity of flaxseed is attributed due to the presence of polysaccharides in the
    seed coat., Mucilage of flaxseed consists of acidic and neutral polysaccharides.,
  'The neutral fraction constitutes L-arabinose, D-xylose and D-galactose and arabinoxylan
    and acidic fraction contains L-rhamnose, L-fucose, L-galactose and D-galactouronic
    acid.', 'Functionally, these polysaccharides possess similar properties to guar
    gum.', The mucilage can be extracted by water and exhibit good foam-stability
    properties., 'Dietary fiber of flaxseed reaches the large intestine and is fermented
    by colonic microflora with production of short chain fatty acids, hydrogen, carbon
    dioxide, methane and biomass and exhibit laxative effects.', 'In the large intestine,
    both soluble and insoluble fibers have their bulking effect resulting in increasing
    both dry and wet weight of the colon contents and faeces.', 'Soluble fiber increases
    water binding, initially by the binding capacity of its macromolecules, later
    by increasing the mass of microbial cells.', The contribution of soluble fiber
    to faecal weight was insignificant compared to insoluble fiber., 'Recent studies,
    however, have shown that it is of the same magnitude.', 'Water-binding capacity
    of flaxseed insoluble fiber increases the intestinal bulk which is useful in the
    treatment of constipation, irritable bowel syndrome and diverticular disease.',
  Soluble fiber from flaxseed mucilage increases the viscosity of intestinal contents
    and delays gastric emptying and nutrient absorption Inclusion of flaxseed mucilage
    in the diet of broiler chicks resulted in decreased faecal digestibility of fat
    and fatty acids while protein digestion was unaffected., Intestinal viscosity
    of the broiler chicks increased on addition of flaxseed mucilage in the diet.,
  'Traditionally, dietary fiber is used for the treatment of constipation, irritable
    bowel syndrome.', 'Dietary fiber delays gastric emptying, regulate post prandial
    blood glucose levels and helpful in prevention of constipation.', Flaxseed fiber
    plays an important role in lowering the blood glucose levels., Studies demonstrated
    that insoluble fiber slows down the release of sugar in the blood and thus help
    in reducing blood glucose levels to great extent., Soluble gum of the flaxseed
    may be helpful in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases by exhibiting hypocholesterolemic
    effect., Kristensen et al., 2012 studied the effect of differently processed flax
    fibers on the fat excretion and energy balance., It was observed that flax fiber
    enriched drink lowered the cholesterol to a large extent as compared to fiber
    enriched bread., 'However, the consumption of fiber bread increased the fecal
    fat excretion and maintained proper energy balance.', Studies have shown that
    the high intake of dietary fibers is beneficial for the prevention of obesity
    in both men and women., Commercial processing of flaxseeds is carried out to obtain
    oil and various by-products., 'Compositional changes during processing are of
    prime importance to food, feed and nutraceuticals industry.', Processing of flaxseeds
    at commercial level involves multiple steps as shown in Fig., '4.', The amount
    of heat as well as extraction time influence the quality of oilseed meal as excessive
    heating reduce the nitrogen digestibility and net protein utilization., 'During
    the processing of flaxseed to meal, protein, carbohydrates and mineral levels
    increased significantly which contribute to decrease in lipid content.', Protein
    solubility of seeds declined while processing to meal but substantial increase
    in solubility of protein were observed in flaxseed flakes which may be credited
    to the increased surface exposure of protein during conditioning treatment., Heat
    treatment affects the quality of protein and therefore decreases the protein solubility..,
  'However, the total cyanogenic contents of the meal remained unaltered by processing.',
  Several attempts are being made from time to time to reduce the cyanogenic compounds
    of the flaxseeds., One of the simple and convenient methods to eliminate the cyanogenic
    glycosides by use of exogenous enzymes to produce hydrogen cyanide from the flaxseed
    meal and then subjected to steam for evaporation of hydrogen cyanide., 'Similarly,
    autoclaving, microwave roasting, pelleting of flaxseeds resulted in significant
    reduction in cyanogenic glycoside content of the meal without lowering nutritional
    quality of the seed.', 'Commercially majority of the flaxseed is processed for
    extraction of oil which is then used for paints, coatings, linoleum, inks, floor
    coverings, etc.. Industrial oil is not suitable for food or feed, but the residual
    meal can be used as feed for cattle.', 'The very high content of alpha-linolenic
    acid content of flaxseed make it susceptible to autoxidation, leading to deterioration
    of quality, therefore flaxseed oil extraction has been done by cold pressing and
    solvent extraction methods.', 'Even after cold extraction of flax oils, it is
    strongly recommended that oil should be stored in dark glass bottles, supplemented
    with antioxidants to avoid quality deterioration  In India, various techniques
    are used for the extraction of flaxseed oil, namely bullock driven ghanis, power
    driven rotary ghanis hydraulic press and screw-press oil expellers.', Flaxseed
    oil is generally screw pressed without heat treatment as well no refining is done
    except for sedimentation and filtration., Fresh unrefined oil has a pleasant nutty
    flavor and attractive golden color., The oil recovery using double stage compression
    screw press ranges from 86 to 92 %., 'However, various pretreatments viz., the
    adjustment of moisture content,  use of enzymes  steam treatment, cooking  prior
    to pressing results in significant improvement in oil recovery.', Decreasing the
    moisture content of the flaxseeds from 13.8 and 6.5 % resulted in significant
    increase in oil recovery varying from 44.4 and 81 %., Solvent extraction of oilseeds
    using hexane is usually carried out for recovery of high quality oil and retention
    of polar lipids., 'Cold pressing results in only partial recovery of the oil;
    therefore, pressing of the seeds is followed by solvent extraction at high temperatures
    to achieve maximum oil recovery.', 'But the alpha-linolenic acid is degraded by
    exposure to high temperature; therefore, supercritical fluid extraction technique
    can be a boon to such oils.', Supercritical carbon dioxide  is the most often
    used supercritical fluid for purpose of oil extraction as the low critical temperature
    of CO2  allows extraction of heat sensitive compounds without quality deterioration.,
  Lipid composition of the flaxseed oils obtained by both SC-CO2 and petroleum ether
    extraction were studied and it was found that the alpha-linolenic acid content
    was higher in case of the oil extracted using SC-CO2 as compared to oil extracted
    using petroleum ether., Ultrasonic power is also employed for the extraction of
    flaxseed oil., A study revealed that ultrasonic assisted extraction of oil resulted
    in enhanced recovery of oil with increased ultrasonic power., Ultrasonic assisted
    extraction saves time and lesser solvent consumption., Dehulling leads to removal
    of outer layer of the seed coat and hence increasing the availability of nutrients.,
  'As it is well known that flaxseeds passes through the gut as such and useful nutrients
    are not absorbed by the body, therefore efforts are being made to remove the hard
    outer layers of the seeds by using different methods viz., crushing, dehulling,
    grinding etc.', Dehulling removes the hull which results in the elimination most
    of the mucilage and crude fiber., 'Dehulled seed contain high level of protein
    and low carbohydrate content, which makes the flaxseed as potential ingredient
    for food and feed products.', The hull of flaxseed contain an outer layer which
    is tough and fibrous containing negligible amounts of oil and protein and inner
    layer of the hull is soft and has small amount of oil as well as protein., Both
    these layers of hull are intact; therefore they are considered as single component.,
  Several attempts have been made to remove the outer mucilaginous layers of the flaxseed.,
  'Traditionally, mucilage has been removed by aqueous extraction methods.', The aqueous
    extraction method involves soaking of seeds in water at temperature preferably
    between 50 and 80 C with occasional stirring followed by filtration., 'The extract
    is treated with acetone, washed, dialyzed against water and then lyophilized.',
  Hot water extraction result in high yields of mucilage as compared to cold water
    extraction., 'The mucilage obtained using aqueous extraction is known to be free
    of specially cotyledon fractions, but this extraction is not economical as it
    involves various steps including filtration, centrifugation, drying etc.', Dry
    dehulling is also practiced using mechanical methods., Simple process of dry dehulling
    involves fractionation of ground flaxseeds using graded sieves and air separation
    method., Method adopted by Smith et al., 1946 revealed that adjusting the moisture
    content of the seed before grinding results in significant improved separation
    of hull with less contamination of cotyledon fractions., The dehulled meal is
    rich in crude fiber and crude protein., Dehulling also leads to quality deterioration
    of the dehulled meal because abrasive force used for dehulling may results in
    removal of some growth promoting factors as well as some protein fraction., Most
    common method used for dry dehulling of flaxseed is TADD., This is a simple method
    for assessing dehulling quality; it requires small sample size and is useful for
    routine testing in breeding programmes., Dehulling done by TADD method revealed
    that reduction in moisture content of the seed resulted in exponential increase
    in hull recovery., 'However, the amount of hull recovered was independent of speed
    of rotating disk and dehulling time.', Dehulling of flaxseeds by TADD resulted
    in significant increase in oil and protein contents and decrease in carbohydrates.,
  Water hydration capacity and viscosity are reduced upon dehulling as the hull contains
    good percentage of fiber and mucilage which accounts for these properties., The
    hull fraction contains highest palmitic acid and low amounts of stearic and oleic
    acid as compared to whole and dehulled flaxseeds., 'The very high content of dehulled
    meal makes it an attractive unusual source of protein, whereas, high amount of
    carbohydrates in hull fraction makes it a good source of dietary fiber to human
    nutrition.', 'In functional foods arena, flaxseed has resurged as a new potential
    functional ingredient with a vast array of medical benefits.', 'Flaxseed supplemented
    food products are gaining popularity because of its high content of polyunsaturated
    fatty acids, protein, soluble fiber and phytochemicals.', It is utilized as a
    versatile ingredient in various types of food products., 'It is convenient to
    use flax seeds as whole or milled in batters, dough and various baked products.',
  'Flaxseed-water mixture serve as egg substitute in the diet of vegetarians especially
    in baked products pancakes, muffins and cookies.', 'These baked goods are slightly
    gummier and chewier, and have low loaf volume than normal.', One tablespoon of
    milled flaxseed  along with three tablespoon of water  substitute for one egg.,
  Flaxseed gum  can be utilized for stabilization of emulsion in case of salad dressings.,
  Functional properties of flaxseed constituents are presented in Table 4., Flaxseed
    products are quiet stable for a longer period at ambient temperature despite of
    generous amount of alpha-linolenic acid., Several studies justify the above statement
    that storing the milled flaxseed for about 4 months did not result in deterioration
    of quality., 'Similarly, bread prepared with the flaxseed oil cake at the rate
    of 10 and 15 % had peroxide levels well below the threshold limits after the 6
    months of storage.', Flaxseed is also being incorporated in the feed of animals
    to improve the nutritional quality of the meat and fat obtained from them., 'Omega-3
    enriched eggs, pork products are now-a-days available commercially.', 'As already
    discussed, flaxseed oil is rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids specifically the
    alpha-linolenic acid.', 'Decades back, flaxseed was used mainly in the manufacturing
    of drying oil, paints, coating, and printing inks etc.', But recently there has
    been resurgence in the use of flaxseed oil for edible purposes because of its
    nutraceuticals values., 'Fresh flaxseed is golden yellow in colour, has neutral
    taste and is very sensitive to heat, light, oxygen; therefore it is usually extracted
    by cold pressing when it is meant for edible purposes.', 'Since, flaxseed oil
    has very high amount of alpha-linolenic acid, it is highly susceptible to oxidation,
    rancidity and poor sensory quality.', The oxidation products serve as a causative
    agent for chronic diseases., Flaxseed oil is not recommended for high temperature
    processing., Studies reported that the high temperature treatment of the oil result
    in the alteration of its nutritional composition., It has been reported that elevated
    temperature deteriorate the alpha-linolenic acid  which is not desirable in terms
    of its associated health benefits., 'In China, stir frying of flaxseed oil at
    150 C is very common for cooking purposes.', Some studies state that stir frying
    of flaxseed oil upto177C did not cause any loss to the quality of the oil., 'Tocopherols,
    plastochromanol-8, phenolic acids, flavonoids, lignans and chlorophyll pigments
    act as natural antioxidants in various vegetable oils and these are also present
    in fair amounts in flaxseed oil.', 'Storage as well as heat treatment resulted
    in destruction of these natural antioxidants, thus deterioration of the oil quality
    and shelf-stability.', 'Attempts are being made in terms of encapsulation of the
    oil with gelatin-arabic gum capsules, which provide protection against oxidative
    products formed during processing or storage.', 'Due to its high alpha-linolenic
    acid content, it has multiple industrial applications.', Based on the scientific
    research on the stupendous health benefits of linolenic acid it has attracted
    the intellectuals from various fields are doing sincere efforts to widen its food
    applications., 'Plant breeders, food technologists and nutritionists are using
    conventional and molecular approaches for altering the fatty acid profile of flaxseed
    and create its competitive food market.', 'In this respect, initiative was taken
    by Green 1995 reduced the alpha-linolenic acid of flaxseed oil, to less than 5
    %.', Flax council has given the name solin for such cultivars containing less
    than 5 % alpha-linolenic acid., 'The high levels of palmitic acid, oleic acid,
    linoleic acid in the solin cultivars make them suitable for manufacturing of margarines
    and shortenings.', Various clinical trials revealed that the flaxseed constituents
    provide disease preventive and therapeutic benefits., 'This encourages development
    of new branded healthy and functional foods using flaxseeds, oil and cakes.',
  More in vivo studies are required to ascertain the health benefits of flaxseed constituents
    and to know the minimum amount of flaxseed required to explore its therapeutic
    potential for all population groups including pregnant and lactating women and
    to know possible problems posed by its overdose., 'There is need for the development
    of rapid, reproducible and economic techniques for the analysis of nutraceuticals
    from flaxseed.']
