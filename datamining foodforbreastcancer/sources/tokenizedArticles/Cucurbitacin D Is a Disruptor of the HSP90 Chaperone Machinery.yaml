text: ['Heat shock protein 90  facilitates the maturation of many newly synthesized
    and unfolded proteins  via the Hsp90 chaperone cycle, in which Hsp90 forms a heteroprotein
    complex and relies upon cochaperones, immunophilins, etc., for assistance in client
    folding.', Hsp90 inhibition has emerged as a strategy for anticancer therapies
    due to the involvement of clients in many oncogenic pathways., 'Inhibition of
    chaperone function results in client ubiquitinylation and degradation via the
    proteasome, ultimately leading to tumor digression.', Small molecule inhibitors
    perturb ATPase activity at the N-terminus and include derivatives of the natural
    product geldanamycin., 'However, N-terminal inhibition also leads to induction
    of the pro-survival heat shock response, in which displacement of the Hsp90-bound
    transcription factor, heat shock factor-1, translocates to the nucleus and induces
    transcription of heat shock proteins, including Hsp90.', An alternative strategy
    for Hsp90 inhibition is disruption of the Hsp90 heteroprotein complex., Disruption
    of the Hsp90 heteroprotein complex is an effective strategy to prevent client
    maturation without induction of the HSR., 'Cucurbitacin D, isolated from Cucurbita
    texana, and 3-epi-isocucurbitacin D prevented client maturation without induction
    of the HSR.', 'Cucurbitacin D also disrupted interactions between Hsp90 and two
    cochaperones, Cdc37 and p23.', Hsp90 is a molecular chaperone responsible for
    the correct conformation of many newly synthesized polypeptides and the rematuration
    of denatured proteins termed clients via the Hsp90 chaperone cycle., 'Hsp90 functions
    as a homodimer and requires the formation of the heteroprotein complex composed
    of several immunophilins, cochaperones, and partner proteins for assistance in
    chaperone activity.', 'Several conformational transitions of the Hsp90 heteroproteinclient
    complex, coupled to Hsp90 ATPase activit,y results in correct folding and release
    of client protein.', Inhibition of the chaperone cycle leads to client protein
    ubiquiltinylation and subsequent degradation via the proteasome., Hsp90 inhibition
    has emerged as a strategy for anticancer chemotherapeutics due to the involvement
    of Hsp90-dependent clients in a variety of oncogenic signaling pathways., Many
    clients  are contributors to the six hallmarks of cancer., Oncogenic client degradation
    via Hsp90 inhibition ultimately halts cancer progression and has been observed
    during clinical trials of Hsp90 inhibitors., 'Classic small molecule Hsp90 inhibitors
    are designed to perturb N-terminal ATPase activity and include derivatives of
    geldanamycin, radicicol, and several purine analogs.', 'Although Hsp90 N-terminal
    inhibitors are effective at inhibiting Hsp90 function and lead to tumor digression
    through client degradation, N-terminal inhibition also leads to displacement of
    the Hsp90-bound transcription factor, heat shock factor-1, and induction of the
    pro-survival heat shock response.', 'Upon displacement, HSF-1 trimerizes, translocates
    to the nucleus, and induces transcription of the heat shock element.', 'This leads
    to increases in the cellular concentration of heat shock proteins, including Hsp90,
    and resulted in dosing and scheduling problems during clinical trials of N-terminal
    inhibitors.', 'Therefore, anticancer Hsp90 inhibitors that avoid induction of
    the HSR are needed.', Alternative strategies to inhibit the chaperone cycle include
    targeting the Hsp90 C-terminus and disruption of the heteroprotein complex., C-Terminal
    inhibitors include derivatives of the coumarin-containing natural product novobiocin.,
  These inhibitors prevent cancer cell proliferation at concentrations similar to
    N-terminal inhibitors and destabilize Hsp90client protein interactions without
    induction of the HSR., Maturation of all clients requires additional proteins
    that interact with Hsp90 and modulate ATPase activity and/or assist in correct
    client folding., 'For example, the cochaperone Hsp90Hsp70 organizing protein  associates
    with the Hsp90 dimer during the initial stages of the chaperone cycle and facilitates
    the delivery of certain clients from Hsp70 to Hsp90.', 'Peptidylprolyl isomerase
    cochaperones  assist in the correct folding and 3-diminsional structure of clients,
    and the cochaperone p23 promotes the optimal Hsp90 conformation for ATP binding
    and hydrolysis, ultimately resulting in client protein release.', 'In addition,
    classes of clients require the assistance of specific cochaperones for maturation  for
    maturation).', 'Disruption of interactions between Hsp90 and client-specific cochaperones
    may allow for select degradation of clients and avoid systemic client protein
    degradation, a consequence of Hsp90 inhibitors under current clinical investigation,
    and may be the cause of certain side effects.', The cucurbitacin class of natural
    products is a group of triterpenoids that are present in the Cucurbitaceae and
    other closely related families., 'More than 50 cucurbitacins have been identified
    and exhibit a wide variety of biological activities that include, but are not
    limited to, cytotoxicity, antiproliferation, anti-inflammation, antioxidant, antihepatotoxicity,
    antibacterial, and antiviral properties, as well as antimetastatic properties
    and improved anticancer activity when combined with current chemotherapies.',
  'Despite the presence of an -, -unsaturated ketone  located within many of the cucurbitacin
    compounds, several cucurbitacins interact with specific cellular targets involved
    in gene regulation, transcription, and overall cellular fate.', Cucurbitacin D  reduced
    the proliferation of T-cell leukemia cells and ultimately led to cancer cell apoptosis.,
  This cucurbitacin was shown to affect the NF-B pathway and led to the accumulation
    of NF-B and IB- within the cytosol., 'Interestingly, a decrease in the cellular
    levels of Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 was also observed.', Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 levels are regulated
    by Hsp90 clients that depend on the chaperone cycle for correct folding and function.,
  It has been reported that incubation with N-terminal inhibitors led to cellular
    decreases in Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 levels., 'Furthermore, 4, as well as other cucurbitacins,
    share structural similarities to the natural products celastrol  and gedunin,
    which are known inhibitors of client maturation via disruption of the Hsp90 heteroprotein
    complex.', 'However, these natural products inhibit chaperone function by different
    mechanisms.', '2 covalently binds the Hsp90 N-terminus and disrupts the interaction
    between Hsp90 and Cdc37, ultimately resulting in kinase client degradation.',
  '3 binds the cochapreone p23 and disrupts Hsp90-cochaperone interactions, leading
    to client degradation across many different cancer cell lines.', 'Given certain
    structural similarities between the cucurbitacins, 2 and 3, as well as decreased
    levels of proteins that depend on functional clients after exposure to cucurbitacins,
    it was hypothesized that 4, and other cucurbitains, may inhibit the Hsp90 chaperone
    cycle in a manner similar to 2 and/or 3.', 'Herein, we report that 4 prevented
    the maturation of Hsp90-dependent clients by disruption of the Hsp90 heteroprotein
    complex.', 'With the exception of 23,24-dihydrocucurbitacin D  and 23,24-dihydrocucurbitacin
    B, all cucurbitacins exhibited antiproliferative IC50 values at nanomolar concentrations
    against the MCF7 breast cancer cell line.', Western blot analysis for client levels
    in the presence of high and low concentrations of each cucurbitacin revealed that
    incubation with 4 and 3-epi-isocucurbitacin D  led to client degradation., '4
    also disrupted the interaction between Hsp90 and the cochaperones Cdc37 and p23;
    however, 6 did not disrupt these Hsp90-co-chaperone interactions components and
    caused client degradation through alternative mechanism.', 'Furthermore, 4 did
    not induce the HSR, as no increases in the levels of heat shock proteins Hsp90,
    Hsp70, or Hsp27 was observed.', 'Client protein degradation, disruption of Hsp90-Cdc37
    and Hsp90-p23 interactions as well as a lack of heat shock protein induction,
    notably Hsp27, has previously been observed after incubation with 3 and suggested
    4 inhibited cancer cell growth through Hsp90 client degradation via disruption
    of Hsp90-co-chaperone interactions by a mechanism comparable to 3.', 'Cucurbitacin
    D  and cucurbitacin B, along with isomeric 3-epi-isocucurbitacin D, were isolated
    from the fruits of Cucurbita texana  following previously described protocols.',
  'Two additional oxidized derivatives, cucurbitacin I  and E, were obtained as well.',
  These latter compounds along with 6 were obtained in reduced quantities compared
    to that of 4 and 5., 'Fortunately, semisynthetic approaches to these particular
    compounds have been investigated in the literature and can be seen as a solution
    to the lack of material for these natural products.', 'In addition, 9, 10, and
    other reduced C2324 derivatives have routinely been acquired via hydrogenation
    conditions.', Structures of the isolated and semisynthesized cucurbitacins of
    interest are shown in Figure 2., Figure 2., Chemical structures of cucurbitacins
    isolated from Cucurbita texana   and the structures of the semisynthesized natural
    products., 'The isomerization of the -hydroxyketone at C2 and C3 of some cucurbitacins
    has been determined to take place under both acidic and basic conditions, with
    the most thorough investigation having been performed by Galindo and co-workers.',
  'However, an alternative to Galindos procedure was chosen instead, one similar to
    that reported by Sneden et al.', that takes advantage of the slightly acidic nature
    of silica gel., Heating a CH2Cl2 solution of 4 and silica gel to 40 C provided
    useful quantities of 6 for biological evaluation and the ability to recover unreacted
    4., Scheme 1., 'Semisynthesis of Cucurbitacins: 3-epi-Isocucurbitacin D, Cucurbitacin

    DMA, 80 C, 38% ;  H2, Pd/C 5%, EtOH, 88%.', 'While attempting to form cucurbitacin
    derivatives via a Heck reaction, in an effort to improve their biological activity,
    an undesired product was isolated and later determined by spectroscopic analysis
    to be 7.', 'Even though this is not the first report of the oxidation of the -hydroxyketone
    to a diosphenol moiety for cucurbitacins, this is the first example of the transformation
    via a Saegusa oxidation.', 'This result can be rationalized via the ability of
    cucurbitacins to isomerize to form the intermediate enediol, which can be trapped
    and oxidized to the final diosphenol product.', This is the same enediol intermediate
    that is necessary for the formation of isocucurbitacins., 'While 7 was not the
    initially desired product, the resulting extra quantity was now available for
    biological testing.', 'To date, Cucurbita texana has not produced any 9 or 10
    via natural product isolation.', 'However, hydrogenation of the C2324 olefin of
    4 and 5 has allowed for the ability to obtain useful quantities of the semisynthesized
    9 and 10 from a plant species that does not routinely provide them through natural
    product isolation.', 'Select Cucurbitacins Exhibit Potent Antiproliferative Activity
    and Decreased Hsp90-Dependent Client Protein Levels without Induction of the HSR


    Consistent with previous data against several cancer cell lines, many of these
    cucurbitacins exhibited nanomolar IC50 values against the MCF7 breast cancer cell
    line.', 'The decrease in potency observed for 9 and 10 may be explained by reduction
    of the -, -unsaturated ketone.', 'This would reduce the potential for nonspecific,
    attack by cellular nucleophiles.', 'The IC50 values for each cucurbitacin can
    be found in Table 1 along with values for 1, an Hsp90 N-terminal inhibitor, 2,
    and 3.', Table 1., "Calculated IC50 Values for the Controls Geldanamycin, Celastrol,
    Gedunin, and Select Cucurbitacins against the MCF7 Breast Cancer Cell Line  \n\nHsp90
    inhibitors and disruptors of the heteroprotein complex prevent cancer cell proliferation
    at concentrations near the IC50 value by depleting levels of clients necessary
    for cancer cell growth.", 'To correlate client degradation via inhibition of the
    chaperone cycle to the IC50 value for each cucurbitacin, client levels from MCF7
    cell lysates dosed with high and low concentrations  of each cucurbitacin were
    dectected by Western blot analysis.', The levels of heat shock proteins were also
    detected to account for induction of the HSR as well as the levels of p23 and
    Cdc37., 'Incubation with high concentrations of the control compounds 1, 2, and
    3 led to client protein degradation and little change in the levels of Cdc37 and
    p23.', 'Consistent with previous reports, incubation with GDA led to increased
    levels of Hsp90, Hsp70, and Hsp27, indicating induction of the HSR.', 'Minimal
    induction of the HSR was observed at the concentrations of 2 and 3 tested; incubation
    with 3 caused only a slight increase in Hsp70 levels, and the levels of Hsp90
    and Hsp27 were comparable to vehicle control upon incubation with 2 and 3.', Figure
    3., 'Western blot for the levels of Hsp90 clients, heat shock proteins, cochaperones,
    and actin from MCF7 cell lysates treated for 24 h with vehicle  or high concentrations  of
    the controls geldanamycin, celastrol, gedunin.', 'Levels of Hsp90 clients, heat
    shock proteins and cochaperones from cell lysates treated with vehicle or increasing
    concentrations of cucurbitacin D  or 3-epi-isocucurbitacin D.


    Levels of clients and heat shock proteins after incubation with high and low concentrations
    of each cucurbitacin can be found in Figure 3B and within the Supporting Information.',
  'Incubation with high concentrations of 4 and 6 led to a decrease in client levels,
    indicating disruption of client maturation.', These cucurbitacins also decreased
    client levels in a dose-dependent manner at and around their IC50 values., 'No
    changes in Hsp90 or Hsp70 levels were observed; however, Hsp27 levels were increased
    at high concentrations of 6.', The levels of Cdc37 and p23 remained constant at
    all concentrations., Client and heat shock protein levels were unchanged after
    incubation with high and low concentrations of the remaining cucurbitacins., No
    client degradation at high concentrations of compound and constant heat shock
    protein levels at high and low concentrations indicates the mechanism by which
    these compounds inhibited MCF7 cancer cell growth is unrelated to Hsp90 inhibition.,
  'Cucurbitacin D, But Not 3-epi-Isocucurbitacin D, Caused Client Protein Degradation
    through Disruption of Hsp90-cochaperone Interactions


    Concentration-dependent client degradation void of induction of the HSR indicates
    an alternative mechanism to traditional N-terminal inhibitors for preventing client
    maturation.', 'Compounds such as 2 and 3 disrupt the Hsp90 heteroprotein complex,
    thereby preventing cochaperone assistance during the chaperone cycle.', 'In addition,
    concentrations of these compounds that destabilize the heteroproteinclient complex
    do not induce the HSR.', There are several reports of 2 and 3 as Hsp90 modulators
    present in literature., These natural products disrupt the interactions between
    Hsp90 and cochaperones involved in both early and late stages of the chaperone
    cycle., 'Celastrol  was shown to covalently bind the Hsp90 N-terminus, thereby
    disrupting Hsp90 from interacting with Cdc37, a cochaperone involved during the
    early stages of the chaperone cycle.', Gedunin  binds the cochaperone p23 and
    prevents p23 from facilitating progression of the Hsp90 chaperone cycle., 'This
    ultimately results in improper trafficking and localization of clients, such as
    the steroid receptor, glucocorticoid receptor.', 'Consistent with previous studies,
    Figure 4A confirmed that high concentrations of 2 and 3 disrupted components of
    the heteroprotein complex, while the N-terminal inhibitor 1 did not disrupt these
    Hsp90-co-chaperone interactions.', Co-immunoprecipitation of Cdc37 and p23 was
    disrupted in the presence of high concentrations of 2 and 3 when using an antibody
    targeting Hsp90., A high concentration of 4 also disrupted these heteroprotein
    complex components from Hsp90., Incubation with a high concentration of 4 completely
    disrupted Hsp90Cdc37 and Hsp90p23 interactions from MCF7 cell lysates., 'Interestingly,
    a high concentration of 6 had no effect on the interactions between Hsp90 and
    these cochaperones; Hsp90Cdc37 and Hsp90p23 interactions remained intact at high
    and low concentrations of 6.', Figure 4., 'Co-immunoprecipitation of Cdc37 and
    p23 using an anti-Hsp90 antibody  from MCF7 cell lysates treated for 24 h with
    vehicle  or high concentrations  of the controls geldanamycin, celastrol, gedunin.',
  'Co-immunoprecipitation of Cdc37 and p23 using an anti-Hsp90 antibody from cell
    lysates treated with high and low concentrations  of cucurbitacin D   or 3-epi-isocucurbitacin
    D.


    These data suggested that, although 4 and 6 both resulted in client protein degradation,
    the mechanisms by which these compounds disrupted client maturation are different.',
  '4 disrupted Hsp90Cdc37 and Hsp90p23 complexes, which ultimately led to a cellular
    decrease of client levels.', 6 also reduced client levels but did not affect these
    Hsp90-cochaperone interactions., 'This cucurbitacin may directly inhibit Hsp90
    and bind an alternative site to the N-terminal ATP-binding pocket, bind and inhibit
    the function of proteins important for client maturation, or disrupt interactions
    of other protein with the Hsp90 heteroprotein complex.', Patwardhan et al., 'reported
    that 3 does not induce the HSR in several different cancer cell lines, including
    the cervical cancer cell line HeLa and the breast cancer cell lines Hs578T and
    MCF7.', 'More specifically, no increases in the levels of Hsp90, Hsp70, or Hsp27
    were observed after incubation with concentrations up to 160 M of 3.', 'To corroborate
    Western blot and co-immunoprecipitation data reported here and further verify
    4 disrupted client protein maturation in a manner comparable to 3, Hsp27 levels
    were detected after incubation with high concentrations of 3, 4, and 6.', 'MCF7
    cells incubated with 5 and 10 times the IC50 value of each compound, and levels
    of Hsp27 were detected via Western blot analysis.', 'The levels of Hsp27 were
    unchanged after incubation with high concentrations of 3 and 4 and comparable
    to vehicle control; however, increased Hsp27 levels were observed at high concentrations
    of 6 and are consistent with Figure 3B.', Figure 5., 'Western blot for Hsp27 and
    actin levels from MCF7 cell lysates treated for 24 h with vehicle, 5 times,or
    10 times  the IC50 value of the gedunin, cucurbitacin D   and 3-epi-isocucurbitacin
    D.


    Collectively, these data suggest that 4 destabilized client maturation through
    similar mechanisms to 3 by disruption of Cdc37 and p23 from the Hsp90 heteroprotein
    complex; however, 4 exhibited a dramatic 18-fold increase in potency when compared
    to 3.', '6 also led to client degradation at nanomolar concentrations, but did
    not disrupt Hsp90Cdc37 or Hsp90p23 interactions and is presumed to cause degradation
    by alternative mechanisms.', 'Like 3, no increase in Hsp27 levels was observed
    at high concentrations of 4, yet increased levels of Hsp27 were detected at high
    concentrations of 6, further supporting alternative mechanisms of client degradation
    for these cucurbitacins.', 'In conclusion, the curcurbitacins have been shown
    to affect multiple cellular pathways and exhibit potent inhibitory activity against
    many cancer cell lines.', 'Here we report the antiproliferative activity of cucurbitacin
    D and 3-epi-isocucurbitacin D is partly attributed to disruption of Hsp90 client
    protein maturation and cucurbitacin D destabilizes components of the Hsp90 heteroprotein
    complex, ultimately resulting in client degradation.', Experimental data for each
