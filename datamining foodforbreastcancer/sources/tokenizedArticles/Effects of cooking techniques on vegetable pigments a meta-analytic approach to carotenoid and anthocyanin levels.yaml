text: [The aim of this study was to review studies that evaluated the effects of cooking
    techniques on carotenoids and anthocyanins in vegetables and to release a meta-analysis
    of the findings., A literature search was conducted to identify studies that evaluated
    the effects of cooking techniques on the levels of carotenoids and anthocyanins
    in vegetables., 'The database search found 404 results, and an additional 18 articles
    from 1992 to 2013 were selected that met the inclusion criteria.', A meta-analysis
    with a random effect model was conducted using the weighted response ratios  calculated
    for each experiment., 'Significant reductions of carotenoid levels after microwaving  and
    frying  and an increase after stewing  were reported; for anthocyanins, reduction
    was observed after moist-heat techniques such as pressure boiling  and pressure
    steaming, and steaming tended to reduce their concentration.', Increases of anthocyanin
    levels were observed in dry-heat cooking techniques such as microwaving  and baking.,
  'Cooking techniques influence the levels of natural pigments in vegetables, and
    depending on the technique, their levels may increase or decrease.', 'Carotenoids
    were most degraded in frying and most increased during the stewing technique,
    while anthocyanins were most degraded in pressure steaming and most increased
    in the microwaving technique.']
