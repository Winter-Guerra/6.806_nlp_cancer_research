text: [Background., Nausea and vomiting are among the most prevalent and disturbing
    side effects of chemotherapy., 'Therefore, there is a need for additional antiemetic
    agents that could effectively reduce chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting,
    whether alone or in combination with current standard therapies.', 'Since clinical
    data on the effectiveness of ginger in patients with advanced breast cancer is
    lacking, the present study aimed to evaluate the effects of ginger against both
    acute and delayed forms of CINV in a population with advanced breast cancer as
    the main malignancy.', Methods., 'In this pilot, randomized, open-label clinical
    trial, 100 women  with advanced breast cancer who were initially assigned to standard
    chemotherapy protocol with docetaxel, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide  were randomized
    to receive ginger  plus standard antiemetic regimen  or standard antiemetic regimen
    alone.', The duration of treatment with ginger was specified to 4 days from the
    initiation of chemotherapy., 'Prevalence, score, and severity of nausea, vomiting,
    and retching were assessed using a simplified form of Rhodes index in the first
    6 hours, between 6 to 24 hours, and days 2, 3, and 4 postchemotherapy.', Results.,
  A significantly lower prevalence of nausea was observed in the ginger group during
    6 to 24 hours postchemotherapy., 'Despite this effect, no other significant additional
    benefit from ginger  was observed against prevalence or severity of nausea, vomiting,
    and retching in any of the assessed periods.', Conclusion., Addition of ginger  to
    standard antiemetic therapy  in patients with advanced breast cancer effectively
    reduces the prevalence of nausea 6 to 24 hours postchemotherapy., 'However, there
    is no other additional advantage for ginger in reducing prevalence or severity
    of acute or delayed CINV.']
