    To produce doenjang with enhanced biological activities, doenjang was prepared
    by fermenting regular soybeans, germinated soybeans, and germinated black soybeans  for
    90 days.', The isoflavone contents in GS and GBS-doenjang were slightly higher

    Introduction Soybeans are a common raw material in traditional Korean fermented
    foods.', It has been well documented that isoflavones in soybeans can eradicate
    harmful active oxygen species., 'Isoflavones not only exhibit antioxidant and
    anticancer activities, but also aid in prevention of hormone-related diseases,
    such as menopausal syndrome, osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease, breast cancer,
    prostate cancer, and colorectal cancer, due to an estrogen-like activity.', 'Black
    soybeans  are often more palatable because of anthocyanin pigments in the skin,
    in addition to nutritional components.', Black soybeans also have stronger antioxidant
    effects and contain more isoflavones than regular soybeans., It has been shown
    that the anthocyanins contained in black soybeans are natural water soluble pigments
    that produce a red-purple color and a high biological activity level., 'Historically,
    black soybeans have been largely used as health-functional foods.', 'Plant seeds
    require proper levels of temperature, moisture, and oxygen to germinate.', 'Also,
    seed biological activities increase upon germination and cause changes in the
    seed composition.', 'In particular, soybeans exhibit decreases in protein and
    fat contents due to breathing and metabolism associated with the process of germination.',
  The contents of isoflavones are increased or decreased according to the stage of
    germination  and changes can be observed in nutritional factors and biologically
    active substances., 'Doenjang  is a representative traditional Korean fermented
    food that has played an important role in providing protein in typically grain-
    centered, protein-scarce diets.', 'Doenjang shows higher isoflavone activity levels
    than other soybean-based fermented foods  in the form of aglycones, which result
    from hydrolysis of glycosides.', 'Doenjang is an excellent source of isoflavones,
    based on a study in which doenjang exhibited higher absorption rates and more
    biological applicability than glycosides.', 'Hyeong-Eun Kim, Yong-Suk Kim  Department

    Kim and Kim Recently, many studies have been conducted on the functional, nutritional,
    and non-nutritional components of soybeans, which have been associated with biological
    activities of anti-cancer, anti-aging, and anti-hypertension.', 'In particular,
    as with the adult diseases of hypertension, arteriosclerosis, and hyperlipidemia,
    the causes are closely related to patient eating habits.', 'Thus, developing functional
    foods that maximize the biological activity of common ingredients can contribute
    meaningful solutions to the problems of disease prevention.', 'In particular,
    the functionalities of doenjang can be observed in specific by- products, such
    as the various peptides and amino acids generated during the fermentation and
    maturation periods of soybeans, rice, and wheat.', It is important to note that
    the raw materials used in producing doenjang have a critical role in determining
    the functionalities of doenjang., 'In this study, changes in the biological activities
    of germinated soybeans and germinated black soybeans were observed and compared.',
  'Changing isoflavone contents antioxidant activities, angiotensin-converting enzyme
    - inhibiting effects, and fibrinolytic activities during fermentation were studied
    due to an interest in producing doenjang with enhanced biological activities.',
  'Materials and Methods Materials and reagents Regular soybean  and black soybean
    cultivars  produced in the autumn of 2011 in Sunchang, Jeonbuk, Korea were used
    for doenjang preparation.', 'The isoflavone standards of daidzein, genistein,
    and glycitein for analysis of the isoflavone contents were obtained from Sigma
    Chemical Co..', 'The NaCl, HCl, KH 2PO 4, sodium phosphate buffer, methanol, and
    ethyl acetate for analysis were obtained from Junsei Chemical Co., Ltd.. Tween
    80 and Tween 20 were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. All standard solutions for
    testing were filtered through a 0.2 m syringe filter  prior to HPLC.', 'Soybean
    germination Regular and black soybeans were washed and soaked in distilled water
    at 20C for 5 h. Then, beans were drained, soaked in 0.3 M NaCl at 20C for 5 h,
    and germinated for 48 h at 20C and 85% relative humidity using an incubator.',
  Germinated regular and black soybeans were used for meju  preparation., 'Koji preparation
    Non-glutinous rice was soaked in distilled water for 12 h at 20C, drained, and
    steam-heated  for 30 min at 121C.', 'The koji was then cooled to approximately
    30C, inoculated with a 3%  spore suspension of Aspergillus oryzae  and incubated
    for 5 days at 25C.', The spore suspension was prepared by homogenizing  spores
    using 10 mL of 0.1% peptone water  containing 0.1% Tween 80 in the plate count
    agar medium., 'Meju preparation For preparation of 3 types of doenjang, 3 types
    of meju were prepared with using regular soybeans, germinated soybeans, and germinated
    black soybeans.', 'The meju was prepared following methods previously described
    by Oh et al.. Soybeans were germinated and steam-heated  for 30 min at 121C, then
    cooled to 30C.', 'For meju fermented with A. oryzae  and Bacillus subtilis, steam
    heated soybeans were inoculated with a 0.5%  B. subtilis culture medium  together
    with 0.5%  non- glutinous rice koji prepared using A. oryzae, then the meju was
    mixed and molded into bamboo trays.', 'Meju fermented using A. oryzae  and B.
    subtilis  were fermented for 12 days at 28C, and then dried for 3 days in a drying
    room.', The meju was finely ground using waring blender  to pass through a 425
    m sieve  for subsequent analysis., Doenjang preparation The mixing ratio of raw
    ingredients for preparation of doenjang was obtained from traditional methods
    of the Sunchang region., 'The ground powder of each of the 3 meju types, purified
    salt, and tap water was mixed in 33:13:54 ratios.', A total of 15 kg of each mixture
    was used to fill an onggi  and fermentation was performed for 90 days at 25C in
    an incubator., Samples were analyzed at 15 day intervals., Determination of isoflavone
    contents The isoflavone content of doenjang was analyzed using HPLC., 'For analysis
    of the daidzein, glycitein, and genistein components of isoflavones, 0.5 g of
    freeze-dried finely ground sample powder was put into a test tube to which 7.5
    mL of 1 N HCl was added.', The solution was then mixed using a vortex mixer  and
    incubated 90 min at 100C for complete conversion of glucoside to aglycones., The
    solution was Biological Activities of Doenjang 1535 cooled to room temperature
    and HPLC grade methanol  was added to reach a final volume of 25 mL., 'The solution
    was mixed using a stirrer  for 6 h and centrifuged at 3,202g for 10 min.', Extracts
    were filtered through a 0.2 m syringe filter  before analysis using a Futecs HPLC
    system., 'The HPLC system, which consisted of a model NS-6000A auto-sampler, a
    model NS-2004GP pump, and a model NS-2100D UV/visible detector, was used to analyze
    each sample.', A Supelcosil LC-18 column  was used., The mobile phase composed
    of acetonitrile  and 0.05 M KH 2PO 4  was used at the same ratio during all analyses.,
  'The injection volume was 20 L, the flow rate was 1.2 mL/min at 40C, and the UV
    absorbance was monitored by spectrophotometer  at 254 nm.', Analyses were repeated
    3 times., 'Sample preparation for measurement of antioxidative activity Freeze-dried
    doenjang  was ground using waring blender  and then extracted with 20 mL of distilled
    water using shaking incubator  at 160 rpm, 30C for 3 h. Extracts were centrifuged
    at 10,000g for 30 min.', The resulting supernatant liquid was used as a doenjang
    extract solution., DPPH radical scavenging activity The DPPH radical scavenging
    activity was analyzed using a DPPH  ethanol  solution., 'Extracts to be tested  were
    added to 2.4 mL of a 0.4 mM DPPH solution dissolved in absolute ethyl alcohol,
    and mixed  for 10 s. After 10 min, the absorbance at 526 nm was measured using
    a spectrophotometer.', Control samples contained distilled water instead of an
    extract., 'The DPPH radical scavenging activity was calculated as a percentage
    of DPPH discoloration using the formula: DPPH radical scavenging activity  =100
    Antioxidant activity of linoleic acid  To measure the antioxidant activity, a
    linoleic acid emulsion was prepared by mixing a solution containing 50 mL of a
    0.2 M sodium phosphate buffer, 0.2804 g of linoleic acid, and 0.2804 g of Tween
    20.', 'The extract to be tested  was added to 2 mL of the linoleic acid emulsion
    and mixed  for 10 s. After acidification by incubating for 15 h at 37C for 15
    h at 37C in an incubator, the acidified solution was added to 6 mL of 60% methanol
    and the absorbance was measured at 234 nm using a spectro- photometer.', Control
    samples contained distilled water instead of extracts., 'The antioxidant activity
    was calculated as a percentage using the formula: AOA =100 ACE activity inhibiting
    effects The ACE inhibition activity was determined using the method previously
    described by Cheung and Cushman  with slight modification.', Freeze-dried doenjang  was
    extracted using 20 mL of distilled water at 95C for 20 min., 'An amount of 20
    mL of distilled water was added to aqueous extracts, followed by centrifugation
    at 10,000g for 20 min.', 'Then, 0.05 mL of the supernatant from centrifugation,
    combined with 0.05 mL of Hip-His-Leu  was pre-incubated for 5 min at 37C.', The
    reaction was initiated by adding 0.05 mL of ACE  and terminated by adding 0.25
    mL of 1 N HCl after 1 h of incubation., 'After addition of 1.5 mL of ethyl acetate,
    the sample was centrifuged at 5,000g for 10 min  and 1 mL of the supernatant was
    dried using dry oven  at 80C for 15 min, then dissolved in 3.0 mL of 1 M NaCl.',
  The absorbance was measured by spectrophotometer  at 228 nm to evaluate the degree
    of inhibition of the ACE activity., 'The inhibitory activity  was represented
    as: 100, where Es is the absorbance of the sample solution, Ec is the absorbance
    of the control solution to which the buffer solution was added instead of the
    sample, and Eb is the absorbance of a blank solution to which the reaction stop
    solution was added in advance.', Fibrinolytic activity The fibrinolytic activity
    of doenjang was analyzed using the method described previously by Oh et al., with
    slight modification., 'Doenjang  was shaken with 90 mL of distilled water, centrifuged
    at 12,000g for 20 min, and then the supernatant was examined.', The supernatant
    was heated using water bath  at 55C for 30 min and 100C for 30 min to separate
    out proteases and inhibitors., 'The pH was adjusted to pH 3.0 using addition of
    1 N HCl, and the sample was centrifuged  at 12,000g for 15 min before adjustment
    of the pH to 8.0 using addition of 1 N NaOH.', 'Treated extracts were centrifuged
    at 12,000g for 15 min  and the supernatant liquor was used as a sample solution.',
  'Fibrinogen  was dissolved in a 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer  with inclusion of
    0.15 M NaCl to a final 1536 Kim and Kim concentration of 0.5%, followed by addition
    of thrombin.', Mixtures were solidified in Petri dishes for 1 h at room temperature
    prior to use., 'In order to examine the fibrinolytic activity, an aliquot of each
    sample  was spotted on fibrin plates followed by incubation at 37C for 18 h. The
    diameter of a clear zone was measured and the fibrinolytic activity  was determined
    using a parallel standard curve based on the standard plasmin.', 'The activity
    was calculated as: Fibrinolytic activity  =100 Statistical analysis All statistical
    analyses were performed using SAS software.', 'Mean values and standard deviations  were
    calculated, and Duncans multiple range tests were applied.', All experiments were
    performed in triplicate., A probability  level of 0.05 was considered to be significant.,
  Results and Discussion Isoflavone contents Isoflavone contents in doenjang produced
    using germinated soybeans  and germinated black soybeans  are presented in Table
    1., The major isoflavones in doenjang were daidzein and genistein., The contents
    of isoflavones decreased as the length of the fermentation period increased.,
  'Also, GS-doenjang and GBS-doenjang exhibited a slightly higher content of isoflavones
    than RS-doenjang in the early stage of fermentation, probably attributable to
    germination of soybeans.', Studies performed by Jeon et al., showed that the isoflavone
    content of soybeans increased due to germination., 'Additionally, Shi et al.',
  'reported that the content of isoflavones increased in the early stage of soybean
    germination, decreased after that period, then the contents increased again in
    the last stage of germination.', The content of daidzein gradually decreased from
    33.77- 37.83 mg/100 g in the early stage of germination to 29.87- 32.22 mg/100
    g after 90 days of germination., 'RS-doenjang contained the least daidzein, GS-doenjang
    contained the most, and GBS-doenjang levels were in between, but with no significant  differences
    between the preparations.', 'The content of genistein, which has been shown to
    inhibit cancer cell growth, gradually decreased from 37.72, 41.30, and 34.63 mg/100
    g in the early stage of fermentation in RS-doenjang, GBS-doenjang, and GS-doenjang,
    respectively, to 32.49, 30.72, and 27.36 mg/100 g, respectively, after 90 days
    of germination.', GBS-doenjang contained the lowest genistein levels with no significant

    difference between the other preparations., 'The contents of daidzein and genistein
    were similar, as in the report of Kim and Yoon  in which the daidzein and genistein
    contents were detected 53859 and 53857 mg/kg, respectively, in doenjang.', 'However,
    these results of this study were different from results reported by Lee et al.',
  'in which the daidzein and genistein contents of sword bean and general soybean
    pastes were 179.8-466.3 and 51.2-233.8 mg/kg, respectively.', 'The total isoflavone
    contents of raw soybeans in this study were 125.04, 149.04, 126.96, and 154.94
    mg/100 g  for RS, black soybean, GS, and GBS, respectively, and the total isoflavone
    content of doenjang tended to be lower  with no significant difference than the
    contents of raw soybeans.', The results of this study were similar to results
    reported by Jang et al., 'where the total content of isoflavones in raw soybeans  were
    decreased by 1,84923 mg/kg due to steeping and steaming.', DPPH radical scavenging
    activity DPPH is a stable free radical that is commonly used to evaluated the
    ability of compounds to act as free radical scavenger or hydrogen donors and to
    measure the antioxidant activity., Results of a comparison of antioxidant activities
    based on an electron donating ability in doenjang are shown in Fig., '1.', The
    electron donating ability of GBS doenjang was increased from 44.96% at day 0 to
    67.18% at day 15 of fermentation., 'RS-doenjang, GS-doenjang, and GBS-doenjang
    all exhibited the highest values of antioxidant activities  after 30 days of fermentation.',
  The results of this study were similar to the results reported by Park et al., 'in
    which the removal rates of free radicals, measured using DPPH and ABTS, in doenjang
    produced using black soybeans increased after 50 days of fermentation, then gradually
    decreased afterwards.', 'In particular, the GBS-doenjang group after 15, 30, and
    45 days of fermentation exhibited significant  differences in DPPH radical scavenging
    activities, compared to the other test groups, and showed the highest electron
    donating ability.', 'In addition, a study  in which the antioxidant activity was
    measured in doenjang produced by mixing of black soybeans and regular soybeans
    with a specific ratio, showed high DPPH radical scavenging activity levels, compared
    with other doenjang types that were produced using only black soybeans.', 'It
    was estimated that the high electron donating ability levels in doenjang using
    black soybeans was due to the color causing ingredients of the black soybeans,
    which were used as raw materials.', 'In a study that investigated the antioxidant
    effects of Korean soybeans, black soybeans and garbanzo beans showed higher antioxidant
    activities than yellow soybeans.', 'Also, the antioxidant effects of garbanzo
    beans, black soybeans, and small black soybeans were higher than for yellow soybeans.',
  'The soybean skin had been removed from the beans in this previous report, thus
    showing antioxidant effects similar to the whole bean.', This leads to the conclusion
    that the electron donating abilities of germinated black soybean doenjang are
    due to the color causing components in the skin of black soybeans., AOA Results
    of AOA measurements in doenjang extracts are shown in Fig., '2.', 'AOA values
    were 29.45-38.34% in the early stage of fermentation, then decreased for all test
    groups.', 'The highest AOA value in all treatments after 45 days of fermentation
    was GBS-doenjang at 45.81%, similar to the electron donating ability, a higher
    activity level than previously reported.', The AOA value for doenjang produced

    colored soybeans, like garbanzo beans and black soybeans, exhibited a much higher
    level of antioxidant activity than yellow soybeans.', 'Colored soybeans also showed
    higher effects than yellow soybeans for all uses, based on the results of an investigation
    of the peroxide content performed by adding soybean skins to a linoleic acid emulsion.',
  'Base on AOA values, GBS-doenjang showed the highest anti- oxidant functions and
    electron donating abilities due to the presence of the antioxidants genistein,
    gentisic acid, - tocopherol, and anthocyanins in the skin of soybeans.', ACE activity
    inhibiting effects ACE is an enzyme that plays a role in transforming the C-terminal
    dipeptide  of angiotensin into an active type of angiotensin II., Results of a
    comparison of ACE activity inhibiting effects during fermentation of GS-doenjang
    and GBS- doenjang are shown in Fig., '3.', The ACE activity inhibiting effects
    gradually increased from 35.70-48.57% in the early stage of fermentation to the
    highest level of expression of 50.38-58.69% after 75 days of fermentation., 'GBS-doenjang
    showed significant  differences in effects, compared to RS-doenjang and GS-doenjang,
    and GBS-doenjang showed the highest ACE activity inhibiting effects after 75 days
    of fermentation, higher than results reported by Rhee et al.', in which Lentinus
    edodes added to Korean traditional doenjang exhibited ACE activity inhibiting
    effects of 24.98-45.76%., 'In addition, the effect of GBS- doenjang was similar
    to results of a study  in which sword beans added to doenjang showed ACE activity
    inhibiting effects of 32.7-63.1%.', GBS doenjang showed higher ACE activity-inhibiting
    effects than all other test preparations., Fibrinolytic activity Fibrinolytic
    activity measurements for GS-doenjang and GBS-doenjang fermented for 90 days are
    shown in Table 2., The different protease and protease inhibitors contained in
    soybeans constitute an obstacle in separation of fibrinolytic enzymes from soybeans.,
  'Therefore, thermal and acidic treatments were applied to separate the inhibitors
    from proteases before measuring the fibrinolytic activities.', 'All untreated
    RS-doenjang, GS-doenjang, and GBS-doenjang preparations showed high fibrinolytic
    activity levels.', There was no activity in thermally treated doenjang at 100
    oC for 30 min and the pH was maintained at 3.0., This result was similar to the
    report Oh et al., 'in which garden beans showed an initial fibrinolytic activity
    of 1.1 unit/mL after heat treatment at 100C for 10 min, followed by an activity
    decrease of 0.5 unit/mL after a thermal treatment at 100C for 30 min.', 'The fibrinolytic
    activities of GBS-doenjang showed the highest level  with no treatment, and were
    127.59% after 30 min of treatment at 55C, which was significantly different, compared
    to other treatments based on a reference of the plasmin 1 unit as 100%.', 'Because
    the fibrinolytic enzymes in fermented foods can be directly obtained by ingestion,
    effective results in preventing cardiovascular diseases can be expected.', 'In
    addition, these findings provide the necessary basis for production of high value,
    functional foods and facilitation of consumption of Table 2.', 'Fibrinolytic activity

    Relationships between the total isoflavone content, the electron donating ability
    based on DPPH and AOA, ACE activity inhibiting effects, and fibrinolytic activities
    in GS-doenjang and GBS-doenjang after 90 days of fermentation are shown in Table
    3.', There were significant correlations between the total isoflavone content
    and the AOA value  and between the isoflavone content and ACE activity inhibition.,
  'There were no correlations between the electron donating ability and the fibrinolytic
    activity, determined using DPPH, and other results.', The results of this study
    were different from results reported by Kim et al., 'where the electron donating
    ability of cheonggukjang  showed a correlation with the phenol content and SOD-like
    activities, and no correlations with the isoflavone content, fibrinolytic activities,
    or ACE activity inhibiting effects.', Differences were probably due to fermentation
    microbe differences between cheonggukjang fermented using Bacillus subtilis and
    doenjang fermented using A. oryzae and B. subtilis., 'Results of the present study
    showed that doenjang prepared using germinated black soybeans  showed greater
    antioxidant activities, ACE activity-inhibiting effects, and fibrinolytic activities
    than regular soybean doenjang.', 'Therefore, doenjang with enhanced biological
