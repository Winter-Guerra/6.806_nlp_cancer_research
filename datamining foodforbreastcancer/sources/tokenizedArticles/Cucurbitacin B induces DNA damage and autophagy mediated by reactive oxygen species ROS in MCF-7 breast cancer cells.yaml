    potent anticancer activities, while the underlying mechanisms remain unclear.',
  We investigated the anticancer effect of Cuc B on MCF-7 breast cancer cells., Cuc
    B drastically decreased cell viability in a concentration-dependent manner., 'Cuc
    B treatment caused DNA damage, as shown by long tails in the comet assay and increased
    H2AX protein expression.', Immunofluorescence staining showed that Cuc B treatment
    induced nuclear H2AX foci., Cuc B activated DNA damage pathways by phosphorylation
    of ATM/ATR., 'Furthermore, it also induced autophagy, as evidenced by monodansylcadaverine  staining
    and autophagic protein expression.', 'In addition, Cuc B treatment led to increased
    reactive oxygen species  formation, which was inhibited by N-acetyl-l-cysteine  pretreatment.',

    Cucurbitacin B   is a natural tetracyclic triterpene compound widely distributed
    in the plant kingdom originally as an antiinflammatory drug.', 'Accumulated data
    demonstrates that Cuc B possesses a variety of bioactivities, such as anti-inflammatory,
    hepatoprotective, and anticancer activities.', 'In particular, the anticancer
    properties of Cuc B have drawn attention of many researchers in recent years.',
  'Cuc B inhibits proliferation of a series of cancer cell lines, such as laryngeal
    squamous cell carcinoma, pancreatic cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, melanoma,
    lung cancer, among others.', 'Furthermore, it enhances the anticancer effects
    of clinical chemotherapeutic drugs: cisplatin, gemcitabine, methotrexate, docetaxel,
    and gemcitabine.', Documented results also demonstrate that Cuc B potently inhibits
    the proliferation of breast cancer cell lines both in vitro and in vivo., 'Cuc
    B suppressed breast cancer cell growth by HER2/integrin signaling, which further
    led to inhibiting integrin-mediated cell survival through ILK1 and paxillin, by
    disruption of microtubule polymerization and disturbance of nucleophosmin/B23
    translocation, and by inhibiting Wnt signaling.', 'However, clarifying the exact
    mechanisms needs further investigation.', Antiproliferative activity of cucurbitacin

    Intracellular ROS, generated mainly from mitochondrial oxidative metabolism NADPH
    oxidase activation in response to xenobiotics, cytokines, and bacterial invasion,
    have been implicated in a wide range of biological and pathological activities.',
  Cuc B induced autophagy and cell death mediated by enhanced production of ROS in
    HeLa cells., 'Cuc B increased intracellular ROS levels in SW480 cells, which led
    to G2 cycle arrest and apoptosis.', 'High ROS levels could cause irreversible
    DNA damage, autophagy, and apoptosis.', 'We previously reported that Cuc B increased
    ROS formation, which induced DNA damage, G2/M-cell -phase arrest, and apoptosis
    in human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial A549 cells and K562 leukemia cells.',

    suppressed the proliferation of MCF-7 cells in a concentration-dependent manner.',

    B treatment for 6 h created no obvious morphological changes., Comet assay showed
    that the comet tails were significantly prolonged in the Cuc-B-treated group compared

    It has been demonstrated that Cuc B suppressed proliferation of various human
    breast cancer cell lines such as MDA-MB-231, ZR-75-1, MCF-7, T47D, BT474, MDA-MB-453,
    but its underlying mechanism was unclear.', 'In our study, the antiproliferative
    effect of Cuc B on MCF-7 was confirmed by MTT assay and colony-forming assay.',
  Both results showed that Cuc B was a potent cytotoxic compound to MCF-7 cells.,
  Our previous report found that Cuc B can induce the DNA damage that causes G2/M
    cell-cycle arrest in human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial A549 cells and leukemia
    K562 cells., 'Here, using comet assay, we found that Cuc B also induced DNA damage
    in MCF-7 cells.', 'This was further confirmed by increased expression and nuclear
    translocation of H2AX, a valid biomarker for DNA damage.', 'ATM and ATR, two large
    phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase-like kinase family  members, are the central regulators
    of the DNA damage network.', 'Both are activated by DNA damage and DNA replication
    stress but with distinct specificities and functions, though there are cross-talks
    in their signaling pathways.', 'It was found that ATM-Chk2 and ATR-Chk1 pathways
    were activated by DSBs and DNA single-strand breaks, respectively.', 'Cuc B treatment
    induced phosphorylation of both ATM and ATR at Ser1981 and Ser428, respectively,
    suggesting that both pathways were activated.', This finding was consist with
    findings of our previous study in K562  and A549 cells., 'Thus, induction of DNA
    damage might be a common mechanism of Cuc B cytotoxicity.', 'Autophagy, a highly
    regulated process, is an important type of nonapoptotic cell death and is implicated
    in cancer treatment.', 'Recent reports showed that several cucurbitacins induced
    autophagy in HeLa, RAW264.7, Jurkat.', and glioblastoma  cells., 'When autophagy
    is induced, the cytosolic form of LC3 is processed to the lipidated and autophagosome-associated
    form LC3II.', 'MDC, an autofluorescent probe, is used to the identify the autophagic
    vesicles and assess autophagy induction through measuring the accumulation of
    MDC-labeled vacuoles.', 'Here, we found that Cuc B induced accumulation of LC3
    II and MDC fluorescence, suggesting that it induced autophagy.', 'AKT/mTOR, ULK1,
    Beclin1, and p62 are among the key regulators of the autophagic process.', 'Autophagy
    induction by mTOR inhibition, resulting from starvation or rapamycin treatment,
    is conserved from yeast to mammals and acts upstream of the ULK1 complex.', 'Beclin1
    interacts with several cofactors to regulate the lipid kin mase Vps34 protein
    and promote formation of Beclin 1-Vps34-Vps15 core complexes, thus inducing autophagy.',
  'P62/SQSTM1, as a scaffold protein, associates with proteasomes and that autophagy
    degrades p62/SQSTM1.', AKT/mTOR and p62 inhibition and ULK1 and Beclin1 activation
    by Cuc B suggested that Cuc B induced autophagy by modulating these molecules.,
  'In glioblastoma, Cuc I up-regulated Beclin 1 and activated the AMP-activated protein
    kinase/mTOR/p70S6K pathway, but not the PI3K/AKT pathway.', 'In Jurkat cells,
    Cuc-B-induced autophagy was associated with G-actin reduction and persistent activation
    of cofilin.', 'Thus, detailing the pathways of Cuc B in autophagy need further
    study.', ROS has been implicated in both the induction of DNA damage and autophagy
    in several types of cancer cells., 'Previous data suggest that Cuc B increased
    intracellular ROS levels in SW480, HeLa, A549, and K562 cells.', 'In the study
    we report here, this effect was confirmed in MCF-7 cells.', The role of ROS in
    Cuc-B-induced DNA damage and autophagy was examined by NAC pretreatment., NAC
    not only reversed Cuc-B-induced ROS formation but also reversed DNA damage and
    autophagy., 'Furthermore, it inhibited activation of ATM/ATR and reversed protein
    expressions of AKT/mTOR, Beclin1, p62, and ULK1.', 'Taken together, these data
    indicate that Cuc-B-induced DNA damage and autophagy in MCF-7 cells is mediated
    by ROS generation.', 'In conclusion, this study showes that Cuc B induced ROS-mediated
    DNA damage and autophagy in breast cancer MCF-7 cells, thus providing new insight
    into the anticancer effect of Cuc B.', 'This study was supported by the Science
    and Technology Development Fund, Macao S.A.R.', and the Research Fund of the University
