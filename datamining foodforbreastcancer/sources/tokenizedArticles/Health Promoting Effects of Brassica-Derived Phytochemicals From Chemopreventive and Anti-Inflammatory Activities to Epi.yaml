text: [A high intake of brassica vegetables may be associated with a decreased chronic
    disease risk., Health promoting effects of Brassicaceae have been partly attributed
    to glucosinolates and in particular to their hydrolyzation products including
    isothiocyanates., In vitro and in vivo studies suggest a chemopreventive activity
    of isothiocyanates through the redox-sensitive transcription factor Nrf2., 'Furthermore,
    studies in cultured cells, in laboratory rodents, and also in humans support an
    anti-inflammatory effect of brassica-derived phytochemicals.', 'However, the underlying
    mechanisms of how these compounds mediate their health promoting effects are yet
    not fully understood.', Recent findings suggest that brassica-derived compounds
    are regulators of epigenetic mechanisms., It has been shown that isothiocyanates
    may inhibit histone deacetylase transferases and DNA-methyltransferases in cultured
    cells., 'Only a few papers have dealt with the effect of brassica-derived compounds
    on epigenetic mechanisms in laboratory animals, whereas data in humans are currently
    lacking.', 'The present review aims to summarize the current knowledge regarding
    the biological activities of brassica-derived phytochemicals regarding chemopreventive,
    anti-inflammatory, and epigenetic pathways.', Epidemiological studies link a high
    intake of brassica vegetables with a lower incidence for different kinds of cancers.,
  'Health promoting effects of brassica vegetables have been attributed to glucosinolates,
    sulfur containing compounds almost exclusively present in plants of the family
    Brassicaceae.', 'However, these chemopreventive effects are not mediated by glucosinolates
    per se but mainly through isothiocyanates, one of the major hydrolysis products
    resulting from myrosinase cleavage.', Myrosinase is a thioglucohydrolase located
    apart from glucosinolates in so-called myrosin cells., Upon plant cell disruption
    enzyme and glucosinolate get in contact and hydrolization is initiated., 'Based
    on reaction conditions  either isothiocyanates, thiocyanates, or nitriles are
    formed.', 'Figure 1: Myrosinase-mediated hydrolysis of glucosinolates with main
    break-down products.', Several in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that brassica
    derived phytochemicals may counteract inflammatory pathways and exhibit chemopreventive
    activity., 'Furthermore, impact of glucosinolates and/or their corresponding hydrolyzation
    products on epigenetic mechanisms including DNA-methylation, histone modification,
    and microRNAs has been recently described and is in the focus of the present paper.',
  Chemical structures of selected brassica-derived phytochemicals are presented in
    Figure 2., 'Figure 2: Chemical structures of selected aliphatic and aromatic brassica-derived
    phytochemicals.', Several studies suggest anti-inflammatory properties of brassica-derived
    phytochemicals., 'Besides others, these beneficial effects may be mediated through
    an induction of antioxidant and phase 1/2 genes and the inhibition of proinflammatory
    signaling pathways via regulation of various transcription factors which may be
    further controlled by epigenetic modifications and miRNAs.', 'Additionally, it
    has been shown that brassica derived phytochemicals exhibit anti-infective and
    antiviral activity.', In this context the transcription factor nuclear factor
    kappa B  is a central player in inflammatory processes., 'In general, NFB resides
    inactively in the cytosol as a heterodimer consisting of two subunits, for example,
    p50 and p65, bound to its inhibitory protein IB.', 'NFB can be activated by a
    wide variety of proinflammatory stimuli including cytokines and reactive oxygen
    species resulting in the activation of upstream kinases, phosphorylation, ubiquitination,
    and consequently the degradation of IB.', 'Once p50 and p65 have been released,
    they translocate to the nucleus and bind to the B site located in the promoter
    regions of the DNA of target genes thereby driving gene expression.', 'NFB target
    genes include, for example, cyclooxygenase 2, inducible nitric oxide synthase,
    Bcl-Xl, Bcl-2, Bcl-3, MYC, matrix metalloproteinase, and vascular endothelial
    growth factor.', Due to NFBs central role in inflammation the transcription factor
    seems to be an attractive target to treat inflammation related diseases., 'A variety
    of naturally occurring NFB inhibitors have been described including brassica derived
    phytochemicals like sulforaphane, phenethyl-isothiocyanate, 8-methylsulphinyloctyl
    isothiocyanate, and indole-3-carbinol.', 'They downregulate lipopolysaccharide  induced
    activation of NFB and suppress COX-2, iNOS, and prostaglandin  expression in cultured
    mouse macrophages, possibly via inactivating NFB.', 'Furthermore, 3,3-diindolylmethane  significantly
    reduced PGE, NO, proinflammatory cytokines, and the number of colon tumors in
    BALB/c mice suffering from colitis associated colon cancer.', In C57BL/6 mice
    we observed that a 7-day pretreatment with SFN resulted in less severe symptoms
    of DSS-induced colitis as compared to PBS-pretreated controls., 'Interestingly,
    Prawan et al.', have observed that synthetic ITCs show an even stronger anti-inflammatory
    activity than that of their natural counterparts., 'However, the underlying mechanisms
    of how brassica derived phytochemicals modulate the NFB pathway are only partly
    understood.', 'Most studies indicate that ITCs inhibit DNA binding of NFB, suppress
    its translocation, or stabilize IB through a decreased phosphorylation of B kinase
    complexes.', This in turn suggests that ITCs target upstream factors like MAPK
    pathways  resulting in NFB inhibition., 'A study conducted by Yang and coworkers  confirmed
    this hypothesis by demonstrating that PEITC inhibits ERK1/2, MAPK kinase 7, and
    MAPK kinase kinase 3.', ITCs may also act anti-inflammatorily through lowering
    ROS-induced NFB activity., Heiss and coworkers observed that SFN impairs DNA-binding
    of NFB which was not accompanied by IB degradation and nuclear translocation of
    NFB., 'It is supposed that SFN interacts with thiol groups, forms dithiocarbamates,
    and binds directly to redox-regulated cystein residues  of the p50 and p65 subunits
    which prevent DNA binding.', A modification of these cystein residues may provide
    an alternative strategy for phytochemical mediated chemoprevention., 'Brassica
    derived phytochemicals may also mediate anti-inflammatory effects through an interaction
    with reduced redox regulators like glutathione, thioredoxin, or redox factor 1,
    leading to changes of the reducing milieu required for correct DNA binding.',
  Nrf2 is a transcription factor playing a crucial role in regulating inflammation
    and chemoprevention., 'Under basal conditions Nrf2 is bound to its cytosolic inhibitor,
    the Kelch like ECH-associated protein 1.', In the presence of activating agents
    including isothiocyanates and other electrophiles Nrf2 may be activated through
    two distinct cellular signaling pathways resulting in the liberation of Nrf2 from
    its inhibitor Keap1., Nrf2 can either be phosphorylated through an activation
    of upstream protein kinases which causes the destruction of the Nrf2-Keap1 complex
    or in the presence of pro-oxidants the cysteine thiols of Keap1 may be modified
    which promotes dissociation of Nrf2 from Keap1., 'Liberated Nrf2 translocates
    to the nucleus where it binds together with several cofactors including small
    Maf proteins, c-Jun, and cAMP response element-binding  protein  to the antioxidant
    response elements  in the promoter regions of genes encoding antioxidant and detoxifying
    phase II enzymes like NADPH quinone oxidoreductase 1, hemeoxygenase-1, superoxide
    dismutase, glutamyl cysteine ligase, and GST.', Khor et al., 'have reported that
    Nrf2-deficient mice suffer under a more severe dextran-sulfate-sodium- induced
    colitis than Nrf2+ mice which was accompanied by a decreased expression of antioxidant
    and phase II enzymes and an increased level of proinflammatory mediators like
    COX-2, iNOS, interleukin 1, and tumor necrosis factor .', Different phytochemicals
    can lead to nuclear accumulation of Nrf2., 'In particular, the effect of SFN on
    Nrf2 pathways has been intensively investigated, showing that SFN in vitro and
    in animal studies successfully activates phase 2 and antioxidant enzymes via induction
    of Nrf2.', 'Also other ITCs such as allyl-isothiocyanate, butyl-isothiocyanate,
    and PEITC have been shown to exhibit similar Nrf2 inducing activity in vitro.',
  PEITC has been proven to be an even stronger inducer of Nrf2-ARE mediated signaling
    pathways than SFN., 'There is evidence that overexpression of Nrf2 can modulate
    NFB expression, since NFB competes with Nrf2 for binding to the transcriptional
    coactivator CREB-binding protein.', 'Accordingly, Surh and Na described a cross-talk
    between NFB and Nrf2 signaling supported by the fact that most of the phytochemicals
    exhibit both, anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties.', Epigenetics describe
    a heritable change in gene expression that is not mediated through a change of
    DNA-sequence., 'Epigenetic changes comprise DNA-methylation, histone modifications,
    and microRNA expressions.', Several studies suggest that brassica derived phytochemicals
    affect epigenetic mechanisms., Epigenetic aberrations take place in the early
    stages of carcinogenesis and partly represent an initiating process of cancer
    development., Phytochemicals may intervene in this process and incarnate potential
    targets for cancer prevention., Posttranslational modifications at the N-terminal
    tail of histones are one epigenetic mechanism that plays a role in gene regulation
    and carcinogenesis., 'Histones can be post-translationally modified by acetylation,
    deacetylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitinylation, sumoylation, and ADP ribosylation.',
  Biotinylation has also been suggested to mediate histone modification., 'However,
    recent studies conducted by Li and coworkers as well as by Xue and colleagues
    discovered that it is not a biotinylation per se but an assembly of different
    proteins including biotin ligase and holocarboxylase synthetase interceding histone
    modification.', 'Histone acetylation and deacetylation are the most analysed modifications
    mediated through a coaction of histone acetyl transferases  and histone deacetylases   resulting
    in gene activation and inhibition of gene activity, respectively.', HATs transfer
    acetyl groups from acetyl-CoA onto lysine residues at the histone  while HDACs
    detach histone acetyl group transferring them onto CoA., Chromatin acetylation
    by HATs opens the chromatin structure providing a possibility for transcription
    factors to approach the DNA which may lead to gene activation., HATs are divided
    into four families on the basis of their structure homologues., 'At present, however,
    there is no literature data available presenting effects of brassica derived phytochemicals
    on HAT activity.', Several studies suggest an effect of these phytochemicals on
    HDACs., HDACs are also divided into four groups according to their structure homology
    to yeast deacetylases., 'Both, in vitro and in vivo studies present ITCs as potent
    HDAC inhibitors.', Recent investigations by Rajendran and coworkers  revealed
    a dose-dependent inhibition of HDAC activity and an increase of HDAC protein turnover
    following ITC incubation of HCT116 colon cancer cells that was proportionally
    dependent on their alkyl chain length., 'Besides colon cancer cells, HDAC inhibitory
    effects of SFN have been shown in various prostate epithelial cells--normal prostate
    epithelial cells, benign hyperplasia, and cancerous  prostate epithelial cells  as
    well as in different breast cancer cells.', The HDAC inhibitory effect of SFN
    has also been confirmed in an in vivo model., 'Also other ITCs, including PEITC,
    the synthetic phenylhexyl-ITC   and benzyl-ITC, inhibit HDAC activity in different
    cell lines.', 'The indole DIM, a known brassica derived plant bioactive, has been
    reported to decrease HDAC activity in the prostate cancer cell lines PC-3 and
    LnCaP.', 'Interestingly, the monomer of the compound I3C had only a weak effect
    on LnCaP cells, which are androgen sensitive, and non on PC-3 cells being androgen-insensitive.',
  In a clinical trial it turned out that SFN-rich broccoli sprouts consumed by healthy
    human subjects exhibit HDAC inhibitory effects., DNA methylation is regulated
    by various DNA-methyltransferases  that transfer methyl groups from the methyl
    precursor S-adenosyl-L-methionine  to the C5-position of certain cytosines and
    influence gene transcription., 'Gene promoter regions rich in CpG sequences--so
    called CpG islands--are generally unmethylated in normal cells, whereas transformed
    cells often show hypermethylated promoters and/or genome wide hypomethylation.',
  Predicted CpG islands in the promoters of Nrf2 and Keap1 are shown in Figure 3.,
  Besides carcinogenesis changes in DNA methylation patterns are also associated with
    ageing and the development of chronic degenerative diseases., Currently only little
    information regarding DNMT inhibition by ITCs is available in the literature.,
  The main investigated ITC regarding its DNMT inhibiting activity is SFN., 'Studies
    conducted by Meeran and colleagues  in the human breast cancer cell lines, MCF-7
    and MDA-MB-231, revealed an inhibiting effect of SFN on DNMT1 and DNMT3a.', 'SFN
    has been reported to inhibit DNMT-expression in the human colorectal cancer cell
    line CaCo-2, in LnCaP human prostate cancer cells, and in porcine satellite cells.',
  'Furthermore, effects of the naturally occuring ITC iberin  and the synthetic ITC
    PHI on DNMT inhibition in colorectal cancer cells and in the acute lymphoid leukemia
    cell line Molt-4  have been described.', 'However, in vivo data for DNMT inhibition
    by brassica derived phytochemicals is lacking and needs further investigation.',
  'Figure 3: CpG islands in the promoter of Nrf2  and Keap1  identified by using the
    database dbcat.', MicroRNAs  represent a class of evolutionary conserved small
    noncoding RNAs with a length of ~22 nucleotides that control gene expression at
    the posttranscriptional level., 'MicroRNAs bind to the 3 untranslated region  of
    target mRNAs and lead, depending on the base pair complementarity between microRNA
    and target mRNA, to a decreased translation and mRNA degradation, respectively.',
  'MicroRNAs are involved in a number of several cellular processes in the organism
    including development, cell-proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis.', There
    are some data pointing to the notion that Brassica derived phytochemicals modulate
    miRNA expression suggesting that this is one mechanism of how these compounds
    may mediate health promoting activity., 'Slaby and coworkers  treated the colonic
    epithelial cell lines NCM460 and NCM356 with the isothiocyanates iberin and SFN
    which resulted in the regulation of three common microRNAs--miR-155, miR-23b,
    and miR-27b.', 'Interestingly, it has been found that PEITC affects miR-141 in
    LnCaP cells, a microRNA which has been closely linked to the development of prostate
    cancer.', Also Basu and colleagues  observed microRNA-modulating effects according
    to isothiocyanate treatment of mice suffering from pancreatic intraepithelial
    neoplasia., The authors identified an inhibition of miR-221 and miR-375 following
    benzyl-ITC treatment changing hyperproliferative into hypoproliferative pancreatic
    cancer cells., Our own studies revealed an inhibitory effect of allyl-isothiocyanate  and
    SFN on the proinflammatory and oncogenic miR-155 in RAW264.7 murine macrophages.,
  In the lungs of mice exposed to environmental cigarette smoke microRNA expression
    has been altered which could be counteracted by PEITC treatment., 'However, some
    side effects of PEITC, including dysregulation of hepatic microRNAs, have been
    observed which should be investigated in more detail.', 'Furthermore, the brassica
    derived phytochemical I3C has been shown to reverse vinyl-carbamate induced de-regulation
    of microRNAs and the I3C dimer DIM increased miR-146a expression which in turn
    resulted in a decrease of cell invasion.', 'To predict microRNA binding sites
    in the 3UTR of different genes internet based prediction tools, including http://www.microrna.org/microrna/home.do,
    are available.', 'According to http://www.microrna.org/microrna/home.do more than
    40 conserved microRNAs may bind to Nrf2 ).', 'However, only a small number of
    microRNAs, including miR-28, miR-93, miR-144, miR-153, miR-27a, miR-132, and miR142-5p,
    have been confirmed experimentally to directly bind to the 3UTR of Nrf2 and consequently
    downregulate gene expression.', Most of the microRNAs discussed in the literature
    to impact Nrf2 are affecting the expression of the transcription factor indirectly.,
  Eades and coworkers  observed that miR-200a degrades Keap1 mRNA which in turn causes
    an increase of Nrf2 levels in breast cancer cells., 'A recent study conducted
    by Petrelli and colleagues  confirmed the effect of miR-200a in preneoplastic
    lesions, where miR-200a also lowered Keap1 expression resulting in an Nrf2 increase.',
  Also miR-141 binds to Keap1 which results in increased Nrf2 levels., 'http://www.microrna.org/microrna/home.do
    suggests five conserved microRNAs to bind to Keap1 from which already two have
    been confirmed to effectively target the 3UTR of Keap1 ).', 'Figure 4: Predicted
    binding sites of conserved microRNAs of Nrf2  and Keap1  as identified by http://www.microrna.org/microrna/home.do.',
  'The expression of Nrf2 regulating microRNAs is modulated by several environmental
    insults including diesel exhaust  and the mycotoxin ochratoxin A. Interestingly,
    a study conducted by Singh and coworkers suggests that Nrf2 itself targets microRNAs.',
  The authors observed an increase of miR-1 and miR-206 levels while Nrf2 is simultaneously
    upregulated., Figure 5 gives an overview of how microRNAs are involved in Nrf2/Keap1
    signaling., Table 1 lists confirmed microRNAs that target the promoter region
    of Nrf2 and Keap1., 'Table 1: MicroRNAs inhibiting transcription factor Nrf2 and
    its inhibitor protein Keap1.', ITCs are one of the major degradation products
    of glucosinolates derived from brassica vegetables and are partly held to be responsible
    for the health promoting effects observed in populations with a high consumption
    of Brassicaceae., 'The health promoting effects of a diet rich in Brassica vegetables
    have been known for several decades and seem to be a promising starting point
    for, for example, the development of chemopreventive and anti-inflammatory functional
    foods, dietary supplements, and drugs.', Figure 6 gives an overview of how brassica-derived
    phytochemicals may mediate their health-promoting activity., An increasing number
    of studies deal with ITC effects on the chemopreventive transcription factor Nrf2
    and its corresponding target genes including antioxidant and phase 2 enzymes.,
  In addition to studies in cultured cells beneficial effects of ITC have also been
    confirmed in vivo in laboratory rodents and humans., Also the anti-inflammatory
    effects of ITCs are well documented in both cell culture and in vivo studies.,
  The applied concentrations of brassica derived phytochemicals range between 0.25
    and 100 mol/L in in vitro studies and up to 90 mg/kg BW in mouse studies., 'However,
    with regard to ITC effects on epigenetic mechanisms including histone modifications,
    DNA methylation, and microRNAs only a limited number of studies are currently
    available.', In this context several studies have been performed in cultured cells
    and have revealed an increase in epigenetic targets connected with an inhibition
    of HDAC and DNMT as well as on microRNA expression., 'However, data concerning
    the modulation of epigenetic targets by ITCs especially in humans are, by and
    large, lacking even though epigenetic targets seem to play an essential role in
    the development of different kinds of cancer and may depict a promising target
    to prevent and/or treat chronic diseases.', 'Figure 6: Potential chemopreventive,
    anti-inflammatory and epigenetic mechanisms by which brassica-derived phytochemicals
