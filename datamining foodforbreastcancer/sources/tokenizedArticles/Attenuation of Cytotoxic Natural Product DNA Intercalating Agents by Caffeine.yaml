text: [Many anti-tumor drugs function by intercalating into DNA., The xanthine alkaloid
    caffeine can also intercalate into DNA as well as form - molecular complexes with
    other planar alkaloids and anti-tumor drugs., 'The presence of caffeine could
    interfere with the intercalating anti-tumor drug by forming - molecular complexes
    with the drug, thereby blocking the planar aromatic drugs from intercalating into
    the DNA and ultimately lowering the toxicity of the drug to the cancer cells.',
  'The cytotoxic activities of several known DNA intercalators  on MCF-7 breast cancer
    cells, both with and without caffeine present  were determined.', Significant
    attenuation of the cytotoxicities by caffeine was found., Computational molecular
    modeling studies involving the intercalating anti-tumor drugs with caffeine were
    also carried out using density functional theory  and the recently developed M06
    functional., 'Relatively strong - interaction energies between caffeine and the
    intercalators were found, suggesting an interceptor role of caffeine protecting
    the DNA from intercalation.']
