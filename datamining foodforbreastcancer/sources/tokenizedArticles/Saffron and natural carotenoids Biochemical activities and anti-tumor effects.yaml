text: ['Saffron, a spice derived from the flower of Crocus sativus, is rich in carotenoids.',
  'Two main natural carotenoids of saffron, crocin and crocetin, are responsible for
    its color.', 'Preclinical studies have shown that dietary intake of some carotenoids
    have potent anti-tumor effects both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting their potential
    preventive and/or therapeutic roles in several tissues.', The reports represent
    that the use of carotenoids without the potential for conversion to vitamin A
    may provide further protection and avoid toxicity., 'The mechanisms underlying
    cancer chemo-preventive activities of carotenoids include modulation of carcinogen
    metabolism, regulation of cell growth and cell cycle progression, inhibition of
    cell proliferation, anti-oxidant activity, immune modulation, enhancement of cell
    differentiation, stimulation of cell-to-cell gap junction communication, apoptosis
    and retinoid-dependent signaling.', 'Taken together, different hypotheses for
    the antitumor actions of saffron and its components have been proposed such as
    a) the inhibitory effect on cellular DNA and RNA synthesis, but not on protein
    synthesis; b) the inhibitory effect on free radical chain reactions; c) the metabolic
    conversion of naturally occurring carotenoids to retinoids; d) the interaction
    of carotenoids with topoisomerase II, an enzyme involved in cellular DNA-protein
    interaction.', 'Furthermore, the immunomodulatory activity of saffron was studied
    on driving toward Th1 and Th2 limbs of the immune system.', 'In this mini-review,
    we briefly describe biochemical and immunological activities and chemo-preventive
    properties of saffron and natural carotenoids as an anticancer drug.']
