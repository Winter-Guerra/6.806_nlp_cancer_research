text: ['Background: Resveratrol  inhibits cell growth, induces apoptosis and augments
    chemotherapeutics in multiple cancer types, although its effects on drug-resistant
    cancer cells are unknown.', 'Materials and Methods: To study the effects of resveratrol
    in triple-negative breast cancer cells that are resistant to the common cancer
    drug, paclitaxel, a novel paclitaxel-resistant cell line was generated from the
    MDA-MB-231 cell line.', 'Results: The resistant MDA-MB-231/PacR cells exhibited
    a 12-fold increased resistance to paclitaxel.', RES treatment reduced cell proliferation
    and colony formation and increased senescence and apoptosis in both parental and
    resistant cells., 'Importantly, RES augmented the effects of paclitaxel in both
    cell lines.', Up-regulation of the MDR1 and CYP2C8 genes were shown to be potential
    mechanisms of paclitaxel resistance in the resistant cells., 'Conclusion: RES,
    both alone and in combination with paclitaxel, may be useful in the treatment
    of paclitaxel-sensitive and paclitaxel-resistant triple-negative breast cancer
    cells.']
