    in cell culture and in animal models., 'The current study explored the role of
    interrupting bioenergetic pathways in BT-474 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell
    lines representing respiratory and glycolytic phenotypes, respectively and comparing
    the impacts of DHA with a non-transformed cell line, MCF-10A.', Metabolic investigation
    revealed that DHA supplementation significantly diminished the bioenergetic profile
    of the malignant cell lines in a dose-dependent manner., DHA enrichment also resulted
    in decreases in hypoxia-inducible factor  total protein level and transcriptional
    activity in the malignant cell lines but not in the non-transformed cell line.,
  'Downstream targets of HIF-1, including glucose transporter 1  and lactate dehydrogenase,
    were decreased by DHA treatment in the BT-474 cell line, as well as decreases
    in LDH protein level in the MDA-MB-231 cell line.', 'Glucose uptake, total glucose
    oxidation, glycolytic metabolism, and lactate production were significantly decreased
    in response to DHA supplementation; thereby enhancing metabolic injury and decreasing
    oxidative metabolism.', 'The DHA-induced metabolic changes led to a marked decrease
    of intracellular ATP levels by 50% in both cancer cell lines, which mediated phosphorylation
    of metabolic stress marker, AMPK, at Thr172.', 'These findings show that DHA contributes
    to impaired cancer cell growth and survival by altering cancer cell metabolism,
    increasing metabolic stress and altering HIF-1-associated metabolism, while not
    affecting non-transformed MCF-10A cells.', 'This study provides rationale for
    enhancement of current cancer prevention models and current therapies by combining
    them with dietary sources, like DHA.', '2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.', 'Breast
    cancer is the second highest cause for cancer-related mortality in the United
    States, and over 230,000 women were estimated to be diagnosed in 2013 alone.',
  'Metabolic analysis of cancer cells has recently come into focus, although it has
    been almost a century since Warburgs initial findings that cancer cells exhibit
    a glycolytic phenotype over oxidative metabolism.', The functional state of mitochondria
    plays a critical role in carcinogenic invasion and metastasis because it has been
    shown to help stabilize the Warburg phenotype., 'The metabolic reprogramming of
    cancer cells has been shown to be dependent on the activity of hypoxia-inducible
    factor  pathway, mainly HIF-1, which mediates the adaptation of cells under hypoxic
    conditions.', 'Once stabilized, HIF-1 transcriptionally regulates the expression
    of over 1000 target genes, including genes responsible for regulation of cancer
    cell metabolism.', 'Breast cancer patient biopsies have demonstrated a correlation
    of poor prognosis, tumor aggressiveness, and early relapse  with increased HIF-1
    protein levels.', 'With the focus on cancer cell metabolism, dietary factors and
    inhibitors of glycolysis, molecular targets such as HIF-1, are being widely studied
    to treat or enhance the effectiveness of other therapeutics in the treatment of
    cancer.', 'Dietary n3 polyunsaturated fatty acids  have been suggested to have
    anti-cancer properties, and the effects on cancer cell metabolism presents another
    possible mechanism for inhibiting cancer survival and progression.', Recent studies
    have shown that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor  isoforms   and   can
    alter cancer cell growth and survival and that PPAR receptor activity can be modified
    by PUFAs., 'While differential changes in PPAR  activities have been reported
    for both different classes of n6 and n3 PUFAs, multiple studies have demonstrated
    that DHA can modify PPAR levels of isoforms   and .', 'While n3 PUFAs, including
    eicosapentaenoic acid  and docosahexaenoic acid, can alter activities of HIF-1,
    HIF-1 activity has been shown to be modified by PPAR as well, though the effect
    of n3 PUFAs on HIF-1 expression is still not well characterized and the changes
    in HIF-1-associated metabolism by n3 PUFAs have not been fully elucidated.', 'In
    the current study, we hypothesized that DHA will decrease oxidative metabolism
    and alter HIF-1 regulation on downstream metabolism.', 'In order to test this
    hypothesis and compare the impact of DHA supplementation on the bioenergetic signature
    of cancer cells, two metabolically distinct breast cancer cell lines were employed  BT-474,
    with a mitochondrially active phenotype, and  MDA-MB-231, with a glycolytically
    active phenotype.', A non-transformed breast epithelial MCF-10A cell line was
    also examined as a control., 'Together, the data presented herein demonstrate
    that n3 PUFA supplementation alters cancer bioenergetic function and HIF-1-associated
    metabolism, suggesting that supplementation with n3 PUFAs could enhance current
    therapies and lead to new approaches in the treatment of cancer.', 'BT-474 mammary
    ductal carcinoma cells, MDA-MB-231 mammary adenocarcinoma cells, and MCF-10A non-tumorigenic

  'More specifically, the transition from oxidative to glycolytic metabolism in breast
    cancer is stabilized by the alpha isoform of HIF-1.', 'Although the HIFs are tightly
    regulated, increases in mutations often lead to HIF-1 accumulation, which have
    correlated with poor prognosis.', 'The studies reported herein demonstrate that

    the decreases of HIF-1 activity and expression.', The complex actions of n3 PUFAs
    are numerous  and the effects reported here and by others in cancer prevention
    and carcinogenesis are positive., 'The phenotypic differences in metabolism between

    result in augmented mitochondrial activity, although the cancer cells enriched
    with DHA caused an opposite response.', 'These observations may be due to the
    remodeling of the mitochondrial phospholipid composition, where n3 PUFAs have
    been shown to alter mitochondrial structure and function.', More recent findings
    have reported that dietary fish oil can induce uncoupled respiration  in colon
    cancer cells in mice undergoing chronic oxidative stress., 'Other similar reports
    have shown that DHA can increase mitochondrial damage in cancer cells through
    accumulation into mitochondrial cardiolipin, which can lead to cytochrome c release
    and apoptosis.', 'Conversely, the effects of DHA on mitochondrial function is
    diverse among cell types and enrichment of DHA into mitochondrial CL has been
    shown to have protective effects in normal cells.', 'Additionally, DHA has been
    shown to delay mitochondrial permeability transition pore  opening and mitochondrial
    Ca2+ flux.', The findings reported herein suggest that DHA may be modifying the
    mitochondrial phospholipid composition and altering the activity of essential
    inner membrane proteins and channels resulting in diminished overall bioenergetic
    capacity of the BT-474 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines., 'Interestingly,
    LA supplementation decreased HIF-1 protein level  in MDA-MB-231 and decreased
    total oxidation of glucose in both BT-474 and MDA-MB-231.', These results were
    unanticipated and have not been previously reported., 'However, a recent study
    from our laboratory has identified a unique mechanism for LA-induced tumorigenesis,
    which may explain why the LA-induced effects were not universal.', 'On the other
    hand, significant decreases in HIF-1 protein level in response to DHA supplementation
    was diminished in both malignant cell lines.', 'While these differences for treatment
    pertaining to the type of PUFA were inconsistent and did not register for all
    of the experiments or cell lines, DHA has been reported to induce changes in the
    transcriptional levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors.', 'Recently,
    PPAR activation was shown to suppress HIF-1 signaling by increasing degradation
    of HIF-1 protein.', Therefore the possibility of DHA inducing degradation of HIF-1
    protein through activation of PPAR expression cannot be ruled out., 'However,
    decreases in ATP have shown to attenuate heat shock protein 90  function, a molecular
    chaperone responsible for the proper folding of HIF-1.', Large decreases of intracellular
    ATP levels can disrupt HSP90 function for proper folding and stabilization of
    its client proteins., 'We propose that the observed decreases in HIF-1 protein
    levels may also be due to a dysfunctional HSP90 complex, resulting from the large
    decreases of intracellular ATP levels in DHA treated cells.', 'Moreover, DHA supplementation
    prevented HIF-1 induction with CoCl2 treatment, suggesting that there may be multiple
    mechanisms where DHA is inducing changes to the transcriptional activity of HIF-1.',
  Figure 7\., DHA attenuates bioenergetic function and Warburg metabolism through
    HIF-1., Proposed mechanism of the effect of DHA on malignant cells., DHA induces
    degradation of HIF-1 protein through activated PPAR or through hypothesized HSP90
    deregulation., DHA-induced downregulation of HIF-1 transcriptional activity leads
    to diminished bioenergetic function in breast cancer cells., 'In addition to the
    anti-cancer effects of DHA, results presented here show that DHA decreased LDH
    protein levels and lactate production, which was decreased by over 60% in BT-474
    and 50% in MDA-MB-231 cell lines.', 'Although the results may show high lactate
    concentrations due to the Crabtree Effect, a phenomenon originally found in yeast,
    where high extracellular glucose concentrations results in the production of lactate
    while simultaneously reducing mitochondrial metabolism.', 'The DHA-induced decreases
    in lactate concentration may be adequate enough to efficiently reduce the negative
    effects of high lactate production in cells containing a high glycolytic phenotype,
    indicating a possible protective effect to the surrounding tissue and may allow
    DHA to be used as an anti-invasive therapy, a hypothesis that has not been previously
    described.', These data as well as the metabolic data support the hypothesis that
    DHA coordinates integrated targeting of major signal-transduction pathways and
    metabolism in parallel., 'Furthermore, DHA has been shown to enhance efficacy
    in combination with chemotherapies, and results presented here may provide a new
    innovative strategy for combination therapies to target cancer cell metabolism.',
  'Typically, cellular sensing of metabolic stress is caused from the imbalance of
    the AMP/ATP ratio, which has been correlated to the total amount of cellular energy
    available.', 'Increases in AMP/ATP ratio, usually by environmental stresses, result
    in the activation of AMPK through post-translational modification by phosphorylation
    at Thr172.', Other reports have shown increased autophagy in cells harboring wild-type
    p53 and increased phosphorylated AMPK in response to n3 PUFAs., 'These results
    demonstrate that the DHA-induced reduction of ATP levels led to a marked increase
    in the phosphorylation levels of AMPK at Thr172, which suggest that cancer cells
    are undergoing metabolic stress in response to DHA supplementation and further
    confirms that DHA can inhibit mammary carcinoma survival and progression through
    metabolic deregulation.', 'Taken together, this study identifies possible cancer
    prevention or anti-carcinogenic therapies targeting cancer cell metabolism by
    altering HIF-1 regulation.', 'While HIF-1 may not be a specific target of DHA,
    these data provide new important metabolic insights into how dietary DHA modifies
    breast cancer survival and progression.', 'Thank you to the MCW Cancer Center
