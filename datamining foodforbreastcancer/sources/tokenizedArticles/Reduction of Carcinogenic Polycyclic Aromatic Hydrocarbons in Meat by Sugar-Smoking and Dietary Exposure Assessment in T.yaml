text: [Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons  represent an important pollutant in foods
    and/or the environment., 'This study aimed to determine the PAH contents in sugar-smoked
    meat by employing a quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, safe  method combined
    with a GC-MS technique and assess the dietary exposure of PAHs in Taiwan.', 'Results
    showed that the longer the sugar-smoking duration, the more the total PAH formation.',
  'By sugar-smoking for 6 min, the total PAH contents generated in red meat  were
    higher than in poultry meat  and seafood, with lamb steak containing the largest
    amount of total PAHs.', 'Most importantly, the highly carcinogenic benzopyrene
    remained undetected in all of the sugar-smoked meat samples.', 'In addition, the
    cancer risk due to dietary PAH exposure based on total intake of meat in Taiwan
    was ;2  107.', This outcome demonstrates that sugar-smoking can be adopted to
    replace the traditional smoking process with wood as smoke source., 'Polycyclic
    aromatic hydrocarbons  are ubiquitous environmental pollutants that can enter
    food via contaminated soil, polluted air, and water.', 'More than 100 PAHs have
    been characterized in nature, of which benzoanthracene, cyclopentapyrene, chrysene,
    5-methylchrysene, benzofluoranthene, benzofluoranthene, benzofluoranthene, benzopyrene,
    indenopyrene, dibenzoanthracene, benzoperylene, dibenzopyrene, dibenzopyrene,
    dibenzopyrene, dibenzopyrene have been shown to possess carcinogenic, cytotoxic,
    and mutagenic activities.', 'The formation of PAHs in food products during processing
    is mainly due to pyrolysis of organic components including fat, protein, and carbohydrate
    at temperatures &gt;200 C, especially at 500900 C. More specifically, lipids may
    drip onto the flame, generating PAHs in the smoke during heating, which in turn
    adhere to the food surface.', 'In addition, the incomplete combustion of charcoal
    can induce PAH formation, finding their way onto the food surface.', 'Among the
    various PAHs, the low-molecular-weight ones with two or three aromatic rings were
    shown to be more labile to formation during grilling of meat.', 'However, those
    PAHs are classified as probably  or possibly  carcinogenic to humans and are less
    toxic as compared to the highly toxic benzopyrene  with five aromatic rings.',
  'Meat consumption in Taiwan among men and women is estimated to be 202.53 and 129.83
    g/day, respectively, with smoked meats becoming increasingly popular both at home
    and in restaurants because of their unique aroma and taste.', 'However, smoked
    foods often pose an elevated risk to human health due to the presence of high
    PAH contents.', Smoking is one of the oldest food preservation methods., An official
    survey of PAH levels in Swedish smoked meat and fish reported many products contained
    benzopyrene ranging from 6.6 to 36.9 g/kg., 'Among the various products, ham processed
    by the traditional sauna smoking contained the highest level of benzopyrene, apparently
    caused by direct exposure to smoke from a flaming log.', 'Additionally, the combustion
    temperature is particularly critical in affecting PAH formation in food products.',
  'For instance, hot-smoked fish was shown to contain a higher level of PAHs than
    cold-smoked fish.', 'In addition to temperature, the amount of PAHs formed in
    smoked fish can be dependent upon type of fish, smoking methods, wood variety,
    smoke composition, and degree of exposure to smoke.', 'For example, a high content
    of benzopyrene  was observed in fish skin smoked heavily in a traditional kiln,
    whereas a much lower content  was shown in fish smoked mildly in a wood-containing
    house.', 'Likewise, benzopyrene  was generated in direct-smoked belly ham, but
    could be reduced to &lt;0.3 ppb with an indirect smoking process.', 'Additionally,
    the wood nature, such as resin content, could favor PAH formation in smoked meat.',
  'In a study dealing with the effect of the industrial smoking process on PAH formation,
    with liquid smoke the PAH contents could be reduced substantially.', 'Nevertheless,
    a high degree of contamination may occur because of smoldering and friction.',
  'There are also differences in PAH contents in different types of meat with similar
    surface/mass ratio, as evident by a higher level of PAHs in beef hams processed
    in a traditional smokehouse than in an industrial smokehouse.', 'However, there
    was no significant difference in PAH contents in pork between those two processing
    methods.', 'Sugar-smoking, a popular cooking method involving precooking of meat
    in a marinade and then exposure to sugar for smoking in Taiwan, has been frequently
    used as it imparts a characteristic flavor and tenderness to meat products.',
  'However, no information is available as to PAH generation in sugar-smoked meat
    products.', 'The objectives of this study were to determine the PAH contents in
    sugar-smoked poultry meat, red meat, and seafood products by employing a quick,
    easy, cheap, effective, rugged, safe  method combined with a GC-MS technique.',
  'Meanwhile, the dietary exposure assessment of PAHs in Taiwan was conducted.', 'Sixteen
    PAH standards, including acenaphthene, acenaphthylene, anthracene, benzoanthracene,
    benzopyrene, benzofluoranthene, benzofluoranthene, benzoperylene, chrysene, dibenzoanthracene,
    fluoranthene, fluorene, indenopyrene, naphthalene, phenanthrene, and pyrene, were
    obtained from Supelco Co..', 'The QuEChERS kits used to extract and purify PAHs
    from meat included a 50 mL Teflon centrifuge tube containing 6 g of magnesium
    sulfate  and 1.5 g of sodium acetate  and a 15 mL Teflon centrifuge tube packed
    with 1200 mg of MgSO4, 400 mg of primarysecondary amine, and 400 mg of end-capped
    C18, both of which were purchased from Agilent Technologies.', The HPLC grade
    solvents  were from Merck., Deionized water was made using a Barnstead Easypure
    II water purification system., 'Soy sauce was from Gin-Lan Food Co., whereas crystal
    sugar was from Taiwan Sugar Co..


    Meat samples were purchased from a local butcher shop in New Taipei City, Taiwan.',
  'Chicken drumstick, duck drumstick, chicken breast, chicken gizzard, and chicken
    heart were selected as they represented the most popular poultry commodities in
    Taiwan.', 'Likewise, red meat including pork chop, beef steak, lamb steak, ham,
    and pork knuckle were chosen, whereas salmon, shrimp, squid, octopus, and oyster
    were procured for seafood.', 'Prior to processing, all meat samples were washed
    with tap water and weighed, followed by dividing each meat commodity into two
    portions and packaging into two separate plastic bags and storing at 20 C freezer.',
  'Among all of the meat samples, only oyster was purchased before cooking as freezing
    may cause a texture change.', The fat contents in all of the meat samples were
    determined by an ethyl ether extraction method using a Soxhlet apparatus., Smoking
    is commonly used to process meat products in Taiwan to extend shelf life and impart
    characteristic flavor and tenderness., 'Unlike the traditional smoking process
    with wood as smoke source, in this study we used a sugar-smoking process instead.',
  'In the beginning, a fixed number of each meat commodity with a total amount of
    0.2, 0.8, 1.0, 1.8, 1.8, 1, 1, 0.8, 0.3, 1, 1, 0.2, 1, 0.6, and 0.1 kg for chicken
    heart, chicken gizzard, chicken breast, chicken drumstick, duck drumstick, pork
    steak, steak, lamb steak, ham, pork knuckle, salmon, shrimp, octopus, squid, and
    oyster, respectively, was premarinated in a 3-fold volume  of juice containing
    10% soy sauce and 1% crystal sugar.', 'The premarinating time was selected on
    the basis of the internal temperature of various meat samples as recommended by
    the U.S. Department of Agriculture: 30 min and 81 C for chicken drumstick, 25
    min and 82 C for duck drumstick, 10 min and 90 C for chicken breast, 10 min and
    94 C for chicken gizzard, and 5 min and 90 C for chicken heart; 10 min and 82
    C for pork chop, 15 min and 96 C for beef steak, 10 min and 85 C for lamb steak,
    5 min and 84 C for ham, and 20 min and 90 C for pork knuckle; 10 min and 84 C
    for salmon, 3 min and 85 C for shrimp, 15 min and 80 C for octopus, 10 min and
    90 C for squid, and 5 min and 91 C for oyster.', 'After premarinating, about 112.5
    g of sugar was poured onto the bottom of a smoking pot, with one meat commodity
    being placed evenly on a metal screen above the pot.', Then the pot was covered
    with a lid with the smoking time being 3 or 6 min., 'After smoking, all of the
    meat samples were deboned, vacuum-packaged, and stored at 20 C prior to PAH analysis.',
  'All of the meat samples were removed from the freezer, thawed at 4 C, and then
    ground by a mechanical blender  prior to extraction and purification, which was
    performed according to a method described in a previous study.', 'A portion of
    5 g of ground meat sample was taken and placed into a tube and then homogenized
    in 10 mL of deionized water for 1 min, followed by the addition of 10 mL of acetonitrile
    and vigorous shaking for 1 min.', 'Then the QuEChERS containing 6 g of MgSO4 and
    1.5 g of CH3COONa was added, after which the tube was shaken for 1 min and centrifuged
    at 4000 rpm for 5 min.', 'Subsequently, 6 mL of the supernatant was collected
    and added to a QuEChERS cleanup tube containing 400 mg of PSA, 1200 mg of MgSO4,
    and 400 mg of C18EC for purification, followed by centrifuging at 4000 rpm for
    5 min.', 'The supernatant was collected, and a 1 L aliquot was taken for injection
    into GC-MS for PAH analysis.', Identification and quantification of PAHs were
    accomplished using a GC-MS method as described previously., An Agilent 30 m HP-5MS
    column  connected with a 5 m guard column was installed to extend column life.,
  Samples were injected in splitless mode with helium as carrier gas at a flow rate
    of 1.0 mL/min., 'The GC operation conditions were as follows: injector temperature
    at 290 C, oven temperature at 70 C initially, raised to 195 C at 15 C/min and
    maintained for 2.5 min, raised to 240 C at 15 C/min and maintained for 17 min,
    raised to 270 C at 5 C/min and to 310 C at 15 C/min with a holding time for 10
    min; with these conditions a total of 16 PAHs were separated within 40 min.',
  'For MS conditions, the interface temperature was 270 C with an electron multiplier
    voltage of 70 eV, and detection was performed by selected ion monitoring  mode
    according to elution time and m/z of various PAHs.', 'Additionally, each PAH in
    samples was identified by comparing retention time and mass spectra of unknown
    peaks with those of authentic standards.', 'For quantification, 14 concentrations  of
    each PAH  were prepared, whereas 13 concentrations  of benzoanthracene and chrysene,
    10 concentrations  of benzofluoranthene and benzopyrene, 11 concentrations  of
    indenopyrene and dibenzoanthracene, and 12 concentrations  of benzoperylene were
    also prepared.', 'The 16 PAH standard curves were thus obtained by plotting concentration
    against integrated peak area, and the amount of each PAH was calculated on the
    basis of its respective calibration curve.', The method validation was not carried
    out as high accuracy and precision have been demonstrated in a previous study.,
  'The approach used for carcinogenic risk assessment of PAHs in this study is based
    on the toxic equivalency factors, and comparative potency of various PAHs is estimated
    using benzopyrene as a surrogate.', 'The potency toxicity of benzopyrene is characterized
    with TEF as 1, which is then applied as a basis for calculation of toxicity equivalent  of
    the other PAHs, including highly carcinogenic dibenzoanthracene, benzoanthracene,
    benzofluoranthene, benzofluoranthene, and indenopyrene ; midcarcinogenic  acenaphthylene,
    anthracene, fluoranthene, chrysene, and benzoperylene; low-carcinogenic  acenaphthylene,
    acenaphthene, fluorene, phenanthrene; and noncarcinogenic naphthalene.', 'The
    TEQ value for determination of dietary exposure assessment of PAHs was calculated
    aswhere TEQBP is the total TEQ level, converting as BaP using the TEFs of PAHs
    in food, Ci is the concentration of PAH congener i in food, and TEFi is the TEF
    of PAH congener i in food.', 'To assess cancer risk, the dietary exposure was
    calculated by prorating the total cumulative intake level over a lifetime to give
    lifelong average daily intake  using the formulawhere TEQk is the total TEQ levels
    of PAHs in food k ; EDj is the exposure duration j ; IRkj is the average intake
    of food k in exposure duration j  based on daily food consumption data of a nationwide
    dietary survey conducted in Taiwan, 2008, provided by the Academia Sinica, Taiwan;
    BWj is the average body weight during exposure duration ; and AT is the average
    lifespan for carcinogen.', 'Duplicate analyses were conducted for all meat samples,
    and the mean values were subjected to ANOVA and Duncans multiple-range test for
    significant difference  among samples using SAS software.', Table 1 shows the
    PAH contents in sugar-smoked poultry products., 'Among the various PAHs, only
    naphthalene was detected in chicken drumstick  and chicken breast  after 30 and
    10 min of premarinating, respectively.', 'However, following sugar-smoking for
    3 min, four new PAHs  were generated in chicken heart, three PAHs  each in chicken
    drumstick and chicken breast, six PAHs  in chicken gizzard, and five PAHs  in
    duck drumstick.', 'After extensive sugar-smoking for 6 min, several more PAHs
    were produced including acenaphthylene and pyrene in chicken gizzard and acenaphthene
    in chicken breast and chicken drumstick, accompanied by a loss of anthracene in
    chicken heart and phenanthrene in duck drumstick, probably caused by degradation
    or conversion to some other PAH derivatives.', 'Most importantly, benzopyrene
    remained undetected in sugar-smoked poultry meat, demonstrating a much safer processing
    method of sugar-smoking when compared to traditional smoking method with wood
    as smoke source.', 'For total PAHs, a pronounced rise was observed for all five
    poultry meat commodities after sugar-smoking for 3 or 6 min.', Table 1., "Concentrations
    of PAHs a in Premarinated and Sugar-Smoked Poultry Meat  \n\nMean of duplicate
    analyses  standard deviation.", Means of the same kind of poultry in the same
    row with different letters  are significantly different., Means bearing different
    letters  in the same column are significantly different., The PAH content changes
    in premarinated and sugar-smoked red meat are shown in Table 2., 'Likewise, after
    premarinating, only two PAHs  were detected in beef steak, two PAHs  in pork knuckle
    and pork chop, and one PAH  in both ham and lamb steak.', 'However, after sugar-smoking
    for 3 min, some other PAHs were produced: acenaphthylene, acenaphthene, fluorene,
    and anthracene in beef steak; fluoranthene in pork knuckle; acenaphthene and phenanthrene
    in ham; fluorene in lamb steak; and acenaphthylene and fluoranthene in pork chop.',
  'Likewise, after prolonged sugar-smoking for 6 min, several new PAHs were shown:
    phenanthrene and pyrene in beef steak; acenaphthene, phenanthrene, anthracene,
    and pyrene in pork knuckle; fluorene in ham; acenaphthene, phenanthrene, anthracene,
    fluoranthrene, and pyrene in lamb steak; acenaphthene, phenanthrene, anthracene,
    and pyrene in pork chop.', 'Like poultry meat, no benzopyrene was detected in
    all five red meat commodities.', 'For total PAHs, a marked increment was found
    following sugar-smoking over a 6 min period.', Table 2., "Concentrations of PAHs
    a in Premarinated and Sugar-Smoked Red Meat  \n\nMean of duplicate analyses  standard
    deviation.", Means of the same kind of meat in the same row with different letters  are
    significantly different., Means bearing different letters  in the same column
    are significantly different., A similar tendency was observed in PAH varieties
    and contents during premarinating and sugar-smoking of seafood products., 'After
    premarinating, only naphthalene was detected in oyster, octopus, salmon, and shrimp,
    whereas no PAHs were detected in squid.', 'However, after sugar-smoking for 3
    min, seven new PAHs including acenaphthylene, acenaphthene, fluorene, phenanthrene,
    anthracene, fluoranthene, and pyrene were generated in oyster only, whereas no
    PAHs were detected in squid.', 'After extensive sugar-smoking for 6 min, three
    more PAHs  were produced in octopus, as were three PAHs  in salmon, four PAHs  in
    shrimp, and three PAHs  in squid.', 'Also, no benzopyrene was detected in all
    five seafood commodities.', 'With the exception of oyster, a significant rise
    was shown for total PAHs in the other four seafood products over a sugar-smoking
    period for 6 min.', Table 3., "Concentrations of PAHs a in Premarinated and Sugar-Smoked
    Seafood  \n\nMean of duplicate analyses  standard deviation.", Means of the same
    kind of meat in the same row with different letters  are significantly different.,
  Means bearing different letters  in the same column are significantly different.,
  'Comparatively, after sugar-smoking for 6 min, the total PAHs were produced in largest
    amount  in lamb steak, followed by pork chop, beef steak, pork knuckle, oyster,
    chicken gizzard, ham, chicken heart, chicken drumstick, chicken breast, salmon,
    duck drumstick, squid, octopus, and shrimp.', 'More specifically, of the eight
    PAHs detected in chicken gizzard, beef steak, pork chop, and oyster, only fluoranthene
    was classified as carcinogenic by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, implying
    the PAHs present in most meat commodities in this study did not show carcinogenicity.',
  'As fluoranthene was present in minor amounts ranging from 0.2 to 1.7 ppb, this
    should not pose any health risk to human.', 'With the exception of benzopyrene,
    the other PAH levels were lower than those in meats treated with traditional wood
    smoking.', 'Among the various PAHs, the noncarcinogenic naphthalene was the most
    susceptible to formation during premarinating and subsequent sugar-smoking.',
  'The formation mechanism of naphthalene has been well elucidated previously, demonstrating
    that lipid oxidation and degradation products such as cyclohexane or hydroperoxide
    may undergo further oxidation or cyclization to form naphthalene or naphthalene-like
    compounds during heating of model lipids or food lipids.', 'More specifically,
    the formation of cyclic compounds can also be due to the interaction between oleic
    acid and linoleic acid through DielsAlder reaction during heating, which in turn
    undergoes further polymerization to form PAHs or PAH derivatives.', 'Thus, the
    fat content in meat products used in our study should play a vital role in PAH
    formation.', 'In addition to fat content, the fatty acid composition is also important
    for PAH formation.', 'However, with the exception of lamb steak, the other 14
    meat samples contained only a low amount of fat, which should explain why lamb
    steak contained a larger amount of total PAHs than the other meat commodities.',
  'Theoretically, the highly toxic benzopyrene containing five aromatic rings should
    be more difficult to generate than those PAHs with two to four rings.', 'Therefore,
    only under drastic heating conditions more lipid oxidation or degradation products
    were produced, and then the formation of benzopyrene could be possible.', 'As
    both the premarinating and sugar-smoking conditions are quite mild in this study,
    the formation of carcinogenic benzopyrene should be difficult.', 'According to
    previous literature reports, a high amount of benzopyrene could be generated during
    the traditional smoking process with wood as the major smoke source because of
    incomplete combustion of wood.', 'For instance, a high level of benzopyrene  was
    reported to be present in high-fat smoked belly ham by a direct smoking process.',
  'However, with an indirect smoking process the benzopyrene content in belly ham
    could be reduced to 0.3 ppb.', 'Similarly, low PAH formation was observed in meat
    products by employing an indirect process with smoke produced from an external
    smoke generator.', 'Alternatively, liquid smoke was also used to minimize PAH
    formation during smoking.', 'As mentioned above, the amount and kind of PAHs formed
    during smoking can also be greatly affected by wood variety, as shown by a larger
    level of total PAHs and benzopyrene with spruce wood when compared to apple or
    alder wood.', 'However, with beech wood as smoke source, only a low level of benzopyrene  was
    formed in meat.', 'Compared to published reports, no benzopyrene was detected
    in sugar-smoked meat commodities in our study, demonstrating that sugar-smoking
    is superior to wood-smoking in preventing carcinogenic PAH formation, apparently
    due to a much milder smoking condition of the former.', 'Although the traditional
    wood-smoking process was not carried out in this study, the absence of benzopyrene
    in sugar-smoked meat can still be used as a basis for comparison with that in
    wood-smoked meat in the literature as the GC-MS methods employed in this study
    can separate and quantify benzopyrene accurately.', 'Thus, the sugar-smoking process
    can be adopted instead of the traditional smoking process for future meat processing.',
  'With the exception of beef steak  and pork chop, the TEQBaP values in most premarinated
    samples remained nil, mainly due to the presence of noncarcinogenic naphthalene.',
  'The total PAH TEQBaP levels in meat after sugar-smoking for 3 min ranged from 0.003  0.000
    to 0.013  0.002, from 0.001  0.000 to 0.008  0.001, and from 0.000 to 0.030  0.002
    for poultry meat, red meat, and seafood, respectively.', 'Among the various meat
    commodities, oyster was shown to possess the highest TEQBaP, which should be due
    to the presence of midcarcinogenic  PAHs including acenaphthylene, anthracene,
    and fluoranthrene.', 'Additionally, an increase in sugar-smoking time  led to
    a higher TEQBaP level ranging from 0.006  0.000 to 0.018  0.001, from 0.007  0.000
    to 0.041  0.002, and from 0.003  0.000 to 0.032  0.002 for poultry meat, red meat,
    and seafood, respectively, which can also be attributed to the presence of high
    amounts of midcarcinogenic PAHs.', TEQ is calculated by summing each PAHs respective
    BaP toxicity equivalent factor  expressed in g/kg., Epidemiological studies have
    demonstrated that frequent consumption of grilled or smoked meat products prepared
    by traditional process involving a direct contact between food and smoke generated
    by combustion is responsible for the high incidence of stomach cancer., 'Levels
    of carcinogenic benzopyrene in smoked meat products have been recently reported
    to be present in meat, fish, ham by direct sauna method, pork, lamb leg, and salmon.',
  'As indicated before, wood type, processing temperature, and smoking methods can
    strongly influence the amount of benzopyrene formed.', 'Unlike the traditional
    wood-smoking process, meats that are to be sugar-smoked are subjected to premarinating
    and then a shortened time of subsequent smoking for prevention of benzopyrene
    formation.', 'However, the detailed mechanism needs further investigation.', 'LADI
    regarding lifespan and dietary exposure to PAHs was evaluated to assess health
    risk in Taiwan, and the results indicated most LADI of PAH values were insignificant,
    especially in both aged male and female subjects.', 'The highest LADI values of
    0.007 and 0.004 ng/kg BW/day were observed for male adults and female adults over
    a 79 year lifespan in Taiwan, respectively.', 'Accordingly, the LADI values for
    adults were higher than for the elderly.', 'Likewise, the LADI values for male
    adults were larger than for female adults.', 'Among the various meat products,
    red meat  consumed by male subjects showed a higher PAH dietary exposure, whereas
    seafood was the lowest in PAH dietary exposure.', 'Subsequently, the cancer risk
    induced by PAHs was assessed on the basis of the carcinogenic potency factor  of
    benzopyrene, 7.3 1, as suggested by IRIS of the U.S. EPA based on the incidence
    of forestomach cancer in the rat.', 'Then, each PAH convener in foods was converted
    into TEQBaP value based on benzopyrene cancer potency and LADI, and the cancer
    risks of all sugar-smoked meat samples were estimated to be &lt;2  107.', 'According
    to the U.S. EPA, excess human cancer risk of one in a million over a 70 year lifespan  is
    considered to be an acceptable or inconsequential level, whereas a one in ten
    thousand chance of excess cancer risk  is considered to be a serious level.',
  'The cancer risk of sugar-smoked meat is lower than the acceptable level; thus,
    our study demonstrates a much lower cancer risk of sugar-smoked meat.', 'Nevertheless,
    we have to point out that the health risk was assessed on the basis of the total
    intake amount of meat as no information is available as to the consumption data
    of sugar-smoked meat in Taiwan.', 'On the basis of the fact that the intake amount
    of sugar-smoked meat is lower than the total amount of meat, the dietary exposure
    of PAHs for the former should be even lower.', Table 5., "Lifelong Average Daily
    Dietary Intake a of PAHs from Sugar-Smoked Meat Products in Taiwan  \n\nLADI is
    calculated by summing     /  average life span in Taiwan, ca.", 79 years)., 'The
    present study demonstrates, for the first time, the PAH formation in sugar-smoked
    poultry meat, red meat, and seafood products.', 'As no carcinogenic benzopyrene
    was detected and low cancer risk was calculated, the sugar-smoking process can
    be adopted to replace the frequently used wood-smoking process to prevent carcinogenic
    PAH formation.', 'This study was supported by Grant 100TFDA-TC-101 from the Department
    of Health, Taiwan.']
title: Reduction of Carcinogenic Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons in Meat by Sugar-Smoking
  and Dietary Exposure Assessment in Taiwan
