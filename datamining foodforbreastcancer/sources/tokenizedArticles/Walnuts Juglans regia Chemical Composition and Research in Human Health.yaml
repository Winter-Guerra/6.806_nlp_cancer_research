text: [Walnuts are amongst the most widely consumed of all commercially grown tree
    nuts in the world., 'Many health benefits have been claimed for the consumption
    of these including reduced risk of cardio-vascular disease, coronary heart disease,
    type II diabetes treatment and prevention, treatment of certain cancers, and the
    lessening of symptoms attributed to age related and other neurological disorders.',
  'The health promoting benefits of walnut consumption are ascribed to its fatty acid
    profile, which is rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids  with a particularly high
    3:6 ratio  the highest of all the tree nuts.', 'The content of polyphenols and
    other phytochemicals in walnuts, with their claimed cytotoxic properties, also
    make them an attractive candidate for research into prevention of free radical
    induced nucleic acid damage.', Research of walnut consumption in humans and animals
    employing a range of data sets and statistical methods suggest that walnuts may
    be considered a safe potential nutraceutical or possibly pharmaceutical substance.,
  'Nevertheless, few reviews of scientific research on the proposed benefits of these
    nuts exist, despite the numerous claims attributed to them in the lay media.',
  This brief review article attempts to disseminate much of the information surrounding
    walnut consumption and human health benefits to other scientists and the interested
    general reader.]
