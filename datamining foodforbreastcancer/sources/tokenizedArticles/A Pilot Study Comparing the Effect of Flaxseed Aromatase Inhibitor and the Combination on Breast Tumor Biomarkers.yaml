text: [Use of complementary approaches is common among breast cancer survivors., 'Potential
    interactions between aromatase inhibitors  and high phytoestrogen foods, such
    as flaxseed, are not often described.', 'We conducted a pilot 2  2 factorial,
    randomized intervention study between tumor biopsy and resection, in 24 postmenopausal
    women with estrogen receptor positive  breast cancer, to assess the effects of
    FS and anastrozole, and possible interactions between them, on serum steroid hormone
    and tumor-related characteristics associated with long-term survival.', 'The effect
    of each treatment vs. placebo on outcomes was determined by linear regression
    adjusting for pretreatment measure, stage, and grade.', 'Although not statistically
    significant, mean ER expression was approximately 40% lower from pre- to postintervention
    in the FS + AI group only.', We observed a statistically significant negative
    association  for androstenedione in the FS + AI group vs. placebo and for DHEA
    with AI treatment., Enterolactone excretion was much lower in the FS + AI group
    compared to the FS group., Our results do not support strong effects of FS on
    AI activity for selected breast tumor characteristics or serum steroid hormone
    levels but suggest AI therapy might reduce the production of circulating mammalian
    lignans from FS.]
