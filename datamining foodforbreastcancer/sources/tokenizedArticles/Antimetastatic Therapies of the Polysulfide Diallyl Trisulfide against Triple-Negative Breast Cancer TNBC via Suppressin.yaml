text: [Migration and invasion are two crucial steps of tumor metastasis., Blockage
    of these steps may be an effective strategy to reduce the risk., 'The objective
    of the present study was to investigate the effects of diallyl trisulfide, a natural
    organosulfuric compound with most sulfur atoms found in garlic, on migration and
    invasion in triple negative breast cancer  cells.', Molecular mechanisms underlying
    the anticancer effects of DATS were further investigated., MDA-MB-231 cells and
    HS 578t breast cancer cells were treated with different concentrations of DATS.,
  DATS obviously suppressed the migration and invasion of two cell lines and changed
    the morphological., 'Moreover, DATS inhibited the mRNA/protein/ enzymes activities
    of MMP2/9 via attenuating the NF-B pathway.', DATS also inhibited ERK/MAPK rather
    than p38 and JNK., 'DATS inhibits MMP2/9 activity and the metastasis of TNBC cells,
    and emerges as a potential anti-cancer agent.', The inhibitory effects are associated
    with down-regulation of the transcriptional activities of NF-B and ERK/MAPK signaling
    pathways., 'Citation: Liu Y, Zhu P, Wang Y, Wei Z, Tao L, Zhu Z, et al.', Antimetastatic

    to determine their chemical and biological activities., 'The antiproliferative
    effects of DAS, DADS, and DATS were compared in human triple negative breast cancer

    treated tumor cells with the increasing doses of DAS, DADS, and DATS  for 24h.',
  The viability of the drug-treated cells was then measured using an MTT assay., The
    data showed that MDA-MB-231 and HS 578t  cells were more sensitive to DATS than
    to DADS/DAS., We next investigated the cell morphology of MDA-MB-231 and HS 578T
    after treatment with different concentrations of DATS., 'Compared to controls,
    DATS-treated cells had smooth surfaces with obvious reduction of pseudopodia.',
  'Moreover, in our experiments, Actin-Tracker Green staining showed that DATS at
    10 and 20 M could cause the spindle cells to round.', An in vitro study was initiated
    by treating MDA-MB-231  and HS 578T  cells with increasing doses of DAS/DADS/DATS
    and DMSO for 24 h. The viability of the OSCs-treated cells was measured using
    the MTT assay., 'Results were expressed as a percentage of control, which was
    considered as 100%.', Data were reported as mean  SD and at least three separate
    experiments were performed., 'Cellular morphological changes in MDA-MB-231  and

    human breast cancer cells was detected using a wound healing assay., Confluent
    monolayers of cells were scratched to form wounds and then cultured in the presence
    of various concentrations of DATS for 24h., Treatment of tumor cells with increasing
    concentration of DATS led to a dosage-dependent decrease in cell lateral transfer.,

    migration of the MDA-MB-231 and HS 578T cells were examined.', DATS showed a dose-dependent
    inhibitory effect on cell vertical migration  through the Transwell chamber.,
  We next used Transwell matrigel invasion assays to determine whether DATS could
    decrease the cell invasive potential., Our results found that the invasive ability
    of MDA-MB-231 and HS 578T cells was decreased by DATS treatment in a dose-dependent
    manner., 'Combining with the results of lateral transfer and vertical migration,
    these results show that DATS could inhibit the metastasis potential of triple
    negative breast cancer cells in vitro.', Fig 4., DATS inhibited invasion in a
    dose-dependent manner in MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cell lines., 'Approximately 1106
    cells were seeded in the 24-well plate with cell culture inserts, the cells were
    treated with different concentrations of DATS  and DMSO for 24 h to test invasion.',
  Assays were performed as described in Materials and Methods., 'The results showed
    that DATS inhibited significantly cell invasion in a dose-dependent manner., indicates
    P&lt;0.05 versus no DATS group.', Data were shown as means  SD from three independent
    experiments., A zebrafish tumor metastasis model was used to explore the anti-metastasis
    potential of DATS in vivo., The perivitelline cavity of 48 h post fertilization  embryos
    was injected with Dil stained MDA-MB-231 cells., We analyzed the model at 30 h
    post injection  by confocal microscopy., The spread of cancer cells could be observed
    throughout the zebrafish body., 'After exposure to different doses of DATS  for
    24h, the number of MDA-MB-231 cells disseminated foci and the maximal distances
    of metastatic foci were reduced by DATS in a dose-age manner.', This result was
    consistent with the results in vitro., Fig 5., DATS inhibited the dissemination
    and metastasis of human tumor cells in zebrafish embryos., DiI-labeled MDA-MB-231

    functions in cancer progression., MMP-2 and MMP-9 play an important role in tumor
    cell migration and invasion., Therefore we investigated the effects of DATS on
    MMP2/9 expression., 'As shown in Fig 6A, DATS could dose-dependently down-regulate
    the protein expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9.', Then the effect of DATS on the enzyme
    activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 was ascertained by the Calbiochem InnoZyme Gelatinase
    Activity Assay kit., 'As shown in Fig 6D, DATS treatment could lead to reduced
    gelatinase activity in a dose-dependent manner.', MDA-MB-231 cells were treated
    with different dose of DATS for 24h and were then undergone to RT-PCR and real
    time-PCR to examine the mRNA levels., MMP-2 and MMP-9 levels were decreased considerably
    in a dose-dependent manner after treatment with various concentrations of DATS.,

    of NF-KB protein levels and phosphorylation of IB by Western blot analysis., 'Promoter
    analysis of the MMP-2/9 has confirmed the cis-acting regulatory elements, including
    NF-B.', 'To study the underlying mechanism of DATS mediated inhibition of MMP-2/9
    at pre- transcriptional level, we performed dual luciferase reporter gene assay
    to investigate whether DATS could inhibit the transcriptional activity of transcription
    factors on MMP-2/9.', 'To further investigate whether NF-B was involved in the
    transcriptional regulation of DATS on MMP-2/9, we evaluated the effect of DATS
    on nuclear translocation of NF-B.', Treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with 2.5 to
    20 M DATS attenuated phosphorylation of IB., 'Furthermore, as shown in Fig 6G6H,
    treatment of 2.5 to 20 M DATS caused p65 to translocate from the nucleus to the
    cytoplasm.', 'In addition, we found that DATS had a slight effect on AP-1 complex
    protein c-jun and c-fos.', These findings indicated that DATS triggered transcriptional
    inhibition of MMP-2/9 by blocking NF-B nuclear translocation., Previous study
    had reported that the MAPK signaling pathway is involved in modulating the cancer
    metastasis and regulated MMPs in tumor cells., 'After evaluating the effect of
    DATS on the inhibition of cell migration and invasion, the effect of DATS on MAPK
    signaling pathway was investigated by western blotting to explore possible mechanisms.',
  Western blotting showed that 10 M DATS could reduce the expression of p-ERK in MDA-MB-231
    cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner., 'However, phosphorylation of p38
    and JNK 1/2 pathways were remain unaffected by DATS.', 'MDA-MB-231 cells were
    cultured in various concentrations of DATS  for 24 h, and then the cell lysates
    were subjected to western blots with  anti-ERK1/2, anti-JNK, anti-p38 and  antibodies.',
  'MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured in 10 M DATS for different time periods, and then
    the cell lysates were subjected to western blots with anti-ERK1/2, anti-JNK, anti-p38
    and  antibodies.', 'MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with 5 M U0126 and incubated
    in the presence or absence of 10 M DATS for 24 h, and then the cell lysates were
    subjected to western blots with anti-MMP-2/9, anti-ERK1/2  antibodies.', 'MDA-MB-231
    cells were treated with 5 M U0126 for and incubated in the presence or absence
    of 10 M for 24 h, MDA-MB-231 cells were then subjected to cell migration and invasion
    assay.', The migration and invasion abilities of MDA-MB-231 cells were quantified
    by counting the number of cells that invaded to the underside of the porous polycarbonate.,
  The values represented the means  SD of at least three independent experiments.P&lt;0.05
    as compared with the vehicle group., 'To further verify whether inhibition of
    MMP-2/9 expression, migration, and invasion by DATS on MDA-MB-231 through repression
    of the Erk1/2 signaling pathway, we used U0126, a known ERK1/2 inhibitor, to block
    ERK signaling pathway.', Fig 6C showed that U0126 could strongly inhibit ERK1/2
    phosphorylation and MMP-2/9 expression., 'When DATS was combined with U0126, the
    inhibition of DATS on MMP-2 was partly reversed, but the expression of MMP-9 was
    further decreased.', 'Moreover, we found the stronger inhibition of MDA-MB-231
    cell migration  and invasion, with sole treatment and with combined treatment.',
  These results showed the inhibition of the EEK1/2 signaling pathways may be involved
    in reduced expression of MMP-2/9 and reduced malignant behavior in tumor cells.,
  'Triple-negative breast cancer  refers to breast cancers that do not express the
    genes for estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor  and the Her2/neu receptor
    and accounts for about 20% of breast cancers.', 'Currently, chemotherapy is the
    only systemic therapeutic strategy available for TNBC patients.', 'Management
    of TNBC is challenging because of a lack of targeted therapy, aggressive behavior
    and relatively poor prognosis.', 'Since there are no specific treatment guidelines
    for TNBCs, they can only be managed by standard treatment.', 'Anthracyclins, taxanes
    or a combination of broad-spectrum anticancer drugs are first line agents, but
    are prone to tumor resistance and cell toxicity.', TNBC is more metastatic and
    invasive than non-TNBC., It is essential to find novel anti-tumor agent., 'Garlic,
    as a medicinal and edible, has powerful anti-tumor properties.', 'The organic
    sulfides  such as DAS/DADS/DATS have proven antitumor activity in different types
    of cancer cells including lung cancer, prostate cancer, breast cancer, and colorectal
    cancer.', 'In the present study, we found that the TNBC cell lines MDA-MB-231
    and HS 578t were most sensitive to DATS.', 'Previous research has shown that DATS
    induces apoptosis in the estrogen receptor positive cell line MCF-7, but the effect
    of DATS on metastasis of TNBC and the mechanisms were rarely reported.', 'In our
    study, we found that DATS could change morphology of MDA-MB-231and HS 578T cells
    and therefore, may have anti-metastasis potential.', Eckhardt et al., have proposed
    that targeting tumor cell migration and invasion would be a good strategy to treat
    metastatic breast cancer., 'In the present study, we determined that DATS inhibited
    MDA-MB-231 and HS 578T cell horizontal and vertical migration and inhibited invasion.',
  'In addition, we used a fluorescent zebrafish tumor metastasis model to prove that
    DATS had an effect on TNBC metastasis.', The mechanism by which DATS inhibits
    invasion and migration is not yet clear., 'The initiation of metastasis involves
    the interaction of tumor cells with the extracellular matrix, through the process
    of cell matrix adhesion and penetration out of the matrix.', 'The basement membrane
    is the largest barrier between a free malignant cell and the bloodstream, and
    it must be traversed before malignant cells can enter circulating blood or lymph.',
  A large amount of studies have demonstrated that MMPs are critical for this process.,
  MMPs are a family of zinc-dependent endopeptidases that play a crucial role in invasion
    and metastasis through the degradation of the ECM., 'In particular, MMP-2 and
    MMP-9 are collagenases that are crucial for tumor invasion and metastasis through
    degradation of collagen IV.', 'MMP-2 and MMP-9 are not new as therapeutic targets,
    but past clinical trials of early MMP inhibitors proved disappointing.', 'The
    broad-spectrum MMP inhibitors previously trialed in breast cancer produced serious
    dose-limiting musculoskeletal toxicity, failed to reach therapeutic plasma levels,
    and did not extend survivallikely due in part to the inhibitors inability to distinguish
    among MMPs.', 'In our present study, we found that DATS could inhibit MMP-2 and
    MMP-9 protein expression, as well as enzyme activity.', 'Moreover, our results
    showed that the levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9 mRNA were decreased in MDA-MB-231 cells
    after DATS treatment.', 'The transcription of MMPs is regulated by upstream sequences,
    including motifs corresponding to NF-B.', 'It is a transcription factor shown
    to be significantly increased in TNBC tumors, which is consistent with the aggressiveness
    of these tumors.', Our present results demonstrated that DATS inhibited NF-B transcriptional
    activity., 'In the cytoplasm, NF-B is bound to a group of inhibitory proteins
    known as inhibitors of NF-B.', 'The accumulation of non-phosphorylated IB prohibits
    the translocation of NF-B from the cytoplasm to nucleus, resulting in inactivation
    of NF-B and its downstream targets.', Our observations indicated that DATS inhibited
    NF-B activity via inhibition of phosphorylation of IB and repressed nuclear translocation
    of p65., These seemingly contradictory findings indicate that the mechanism of
    MMP-2 and MMP-9 inhibition by DATS could be via modification of NF-B., We predict
    that DATS may inhibit other cancer-related transcription factors and we are in
    the process of examining and identifying other signaling pathways and transcription
    factors altered by DATS., 'Interestingly, DATS had no effect on c-fos and c-jun
    in our study, which normally regulate AP-1.', It is accepted that the activation
    of MAPK signaling pathway is important for regulating NF-B activation and the
    subsequent activity of MMP-9 for cell lines in response to different stimulators.,
  'Our results indicated that DATS had obvious effect on MAPK signaling especially
    in the inhibition of the ERK,.', 'Moreover, the inhibition of MMP-2 by DATS was
    attenuated while MMP-9 was enhanced while blocking ERK signal.', The various effects
    on the ERK might be caused by triggering multiple processes necessary for carcinogenesis.,
  'However, the underlying mechanism needs further to be elucidated.', 'In conclusion,
    we showed that DATS suppresses the metastasis of the MDA-MB-231 and HS 578T breast
    cancer cell lines.', We suggest that the anti-tumor properties of DATS may beneficial
    for the inhibition of metastasis by down-regulating the activities and expression
    of ERK/NF-B /MMP-2/MMP-9., Garlic can be taken in large quantities in the human
    diet., 'Considering garlic has one to three percent of DATS and its derivatives,in
    our research, the concentration of DATS  should be achieved in vivo and be helpful
    for preventing or treating breast cancer.', This work was supported by the National
