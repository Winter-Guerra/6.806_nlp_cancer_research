text: ['Epidemiological studies show that fruit- and vegetable-rich diets are associated
    with a reduced risk of developing certain forms of cancer, including breast cancer.',
  'In this study we demonstrate that a subcytotoxic concentration of apigenin, which
    is a flavone found at high concentrations in parsley, onions, grapefruit, oranges,
    and chamomile tea, inhibited DNA synthesis in a panel of human breast cancer cell
    lines.', Decreased proliferation of MDA-MB-468 cells in the presence of apigenin
    was associated with G2/M phase cell cycle arrest and the production of reactive
    oxygen species., 'Apigenin-treated MDA-MB-468 cells also showed reduced phosphorylation
    of Akt, which is an essential effector serine/threonine kinase in the phosphatidylinositide
    3-kinase pathway that promotes tumor growth and progression.', 'However, exposure
    to the antioxidant reduced glutathione failed to reverse apigenin-mediated inhibition
    of Akt phosphorylation and cell proliferation, indicating that these effects were
    not due to oxidative stress.', 'Taken together, these findings suggest that low-dose
    apigenin has the potential to slow or prevent breast cancer progression.']
