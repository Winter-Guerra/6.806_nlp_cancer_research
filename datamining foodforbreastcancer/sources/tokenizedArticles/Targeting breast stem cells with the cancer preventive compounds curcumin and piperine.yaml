text: [The cancer stem cell hypothesis asserts that malignancies arise in tissue stem
    and/or progenitor cells through the dysregulation or acquisition of self-renewal.,
  'In order to determine whether the dietary polyphenols, curcumin, and piperine are
    able to modulate the self-renewal of normal and malignant breast stem cells, we
    examined the effects of these compounds on mammosphere formation, expression of
    the breast stem cell marker aldehyde dehydrogenase, and Wnt signaling.', 'Mammosphere
    formation assays were performed after curcumin, piperine, and control treatment
    in unsorted normal breast epithelial cells and normal stem and early progenitor
    cells, selected by ALDH positivity.', Wnt signaling was examined using a Topflash
    assay., 'Both curcumin and piperine inhibited mammosphere formation, serial passaging,
    and percent of ALDH+ cells by 50% at 5 M and completely at 10 M concentration
    in normal and malignant breast cells.', There was no effect on cellular differentiation.,
  'Wnt signaling was inhibited by both curcumin and piperine by 50% at 5 M and completely
    at 10 M. Curcumin and piperine separately, and in combination, inhibit breast
    stem cell self-renewal but do not cause toxicity to differentiated cells.', These
    compounds could be potential cancer preventive agents., Mammosphere formation
    assays may be a quantifiable biomarker to assess cancer preventive agent efficacy
    and Wnt signaling assessment can be a mechanistic biomarker for use in human clinical
    trials., 'The online version of this article  contains supplementary material,
    which is available to authorized users.', The cancer stem cell hypothesis asserts
    that malignancies arise in tissue stem and/or progenitor cells through the dysregulation
    or acquisition of self-renewal., 'Stem cells are long lived and capable of acquiring
    multiple mutations over time to transform to malignancy, while differentiated
    cells turn over rapidly.', Clonal expansion of stem cell populations through dysregulated
    self-renewal is hypothesized to be an early step in carcinogenesis., This hypothesis
    is supported by recent studies demonstrating that breast tissue from women who
    carry germline BRCA1 mutations contains islands of cells that uniformly express
    the stem cell marker ALDH1., These expanded stem cell colonies display loss of
    heterozygosity for the normal BRCA1 allele., Experimental knockdown of BRCA1 in
    normal mammary cells leads to an increase in the ALDH-positive stem cell population
    in vitro and in mouse models., 'If primitive breast cells are the targets for
    transforming events, then interventions aimed at reducing this cell population
    may provide novel risk reduction strategies.', 'Current strategies, which include
    prophylactic mastectomy for BRCA1 or BRCA2 carriers, as well as the antiestrogens
    tamoxifen and raloxifene, are all associated with potential toxicities.', These
    toxicities have limited the widespread utilization of tamoxifen and raloxifene
    in cancer prevention., 'Furthermore, hormonal interventions selectively prevent
    estrogen receptor  positive breast cancers, but are less effective, and may actually
    increase the development of ER negative breast cancers.', This highlights the
    important need to develop non-toxic strategies to effectively prevent both ER
    negative and ER positive breast cancer., 'If the cancer stem cell hypothesis is
    valid, then strategies aimed at targeting stem cell self-renewal pathways represent
    rational approaches for cancer prevention.', 'One such pathway is the Wnt signaling
    pathway, which is dysregulated in breast cancer, as well as many other malignancies.',
  'Although the development of specific pharmacologic Wnt inhibitors has proven a
    challenge, there is evidence that curcumin, a dietary polyphenol found in spices,
    is able to downregulate the Wnt signaling pathway.', 'Interestingly, there is
    substantial evidence in preclinical models that curcumin is a potent chemopreventive
    dietary agent.', This suggests that the protective effects of curcumin might be
    due to Wnt inhibition of self-renewal in breast stem/progenitor cells., 'Another
    dietary polyphenol, isolated from black and long peppers, which has been reported
    to reduce cancer incidence in chemical rodent models of lung cancer is piperine.',
  It has been suggested that piperine may also enhance the bioavailability of curcumin
    if these chemopreventive agents are given in combination., 'The cancer preventive
    effects of piperine, as a single agent, in breast carcinogenesis have not yet
    been explored.', 'In order to determine whether the dietary polyphenols, curcumin,
    and piperine are able to modulate the self-renewal of normal and malignant breast
    stem cells, we examined the effects of these compounds on mammosphere formation
    and expression of the breast stem cell marker aldehyde dehydrogenase.', We demonstrate
    that curcumin and piperine are able to inhibit breast stem cell self-renewal and
    provide evidence that these effects are mediated through inhibition of Wnt signaling.,
  These studies suggest that stem cell self-renewal assays may serve as biomarkers
    for cancer prevention studies., Such assays also provide potential mechanisms
    for the action of dietary polyphenols as cancer preventive agents., Curcumin 98%
    pure and piperine 99% pure were donated by Sabinsa Corporation., Both curcumin
    and piperine were prepared into 1 mM stock solutions in dimethyl sulfoxide for
    dissolution into cell culture media., Normal breast tissue from women undergoing
    elective reduction mammoplasty who provided informed consent  was obtained through
    the Tissue Procurement Service with the Department of Pathology at the University
    of Michigan Medical School., 'The tissue was mechanically and enzymatically dissociated
    by methods detailed by Dontu et al..


    Unsorted human breast epithelial single cells were plated in ultralow attachment
    plates  at a density of 100,000 viable cells/ml in primary culture and 5,000 cells/ml
    in passages.', 'Primary mammospheres were allowed to form for 710 days in serum-free
    mammary epithelial basal medium   with curcumin and/or piperine treatment for
    472 h. Primary mammospheres were centrifuged, dissociated with trypsin, a 22 gauge
    needle, and then sieved through a 40-m sieve to obtain single cells.', 'These
    sphere forming single cells, enriched for breast stem and early progenitor cells,
    were used for serial passage  and differentiation experiments to test the functional
    definition of stem cells to self-renew and differentiate.', Sphere number was
    counted manually and verified by two independent observers blinded to treatment.,
  Each experiment was performed in triplicate wells per tissue and repeated using
    three separate tissues to account for intra and intertissue variability and findings
    were averaged with standard error., 'Breast stem cells were identified using Aldefluor  according
    to the method of Dontu et al..


    Unsorted single normal human breast epithelial cells were cultured in suspension
    in serum-free media with curcumin alone at concentrations ranging from 5 to 25
    M, piperine alone at concentrations ranging from 5 to 25 M, or curcumin plus piperine
    compared to DMSO vehicle control and primary spheres collected, dissociated, and
    resuspended in MEBM to form secondary spheres.', 'The secondary spheres were counted
    after 7 days, and then dissociated again and recultured to form tertiary spheres.',
  'Breast normal epithelial single cells dissociated from tertiary mammospheres to
    enrich breast stem cells were plated on collagen-coated plates at a density of
    2,000 viable cells/10 cm petri dish.', 'Curcumin, with or without piperine, or
    dimethyl sulfoxide vehicle control  were added first from the time of plating
    for 48-h treatment with triplicate plates per dose combination.', 'In a second
    set of experiments, cells were allowed to attach for 48 h prior to treatment with
    curcumin and/or piperine and grown in Hams F12 medium with FBS and growth factors
    as detailed elsewhere.', 'Colonies were allowed to form for 7 days, photographed,
    and manually counted using a microscope with a counting grid by two independent
    observers.', 'We treated unsorted normal human single breast epithelial cells
    with curcumin, piperine, and curcumin + piperine compared to DMSO vehicle control
    in 6-well ultralow attachment plates for 72 h, then stained using the immunohistochemistry
    kit  as per manufacturers instructions with ALDH1A1 primary antibody and biotinylated
    secondary antibody and streptavidin immunoperoxidase.', ALDH1A1 cells were quantified
    by flourescence-activated cell sorting  with 4-6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole  for
    viability assessment., 'To assess the lineage composition of the colonies, cells
    were fixed in the plates for 20 min in methanol, at 20C, and then stained using
    Peroxidase Histostain-Plus and Alkaline-Phosphatase Histostain-Plus kits, according
    to the manufacturers protocol.', 'The primary antibodies, epithelial specific
    antigen  and cytokeratin 18 for luminal cells, and CD10 and cytokeratin 14  for
    myoepithelial cells, were used at the dilutions indicated by the manufacturer.',
  'Mammosphere formation  was also examined in unsorted MCF7 and Sum 159 breast cancer
    cell lines in anchorage independent, serum-free media conditions.', -catenin was
    detected in both human normal epithelial cells and MCF7 cell lines by immunohistochemical
    staining )., The effect of curcumin + piperine on Wnt signaling in breast cancer
    cell lines cells was examined by lentivirus-delivered reporter assay systems  to
    stably infect MCF7 cells., 'The virus reporter assay uses a green fluorescence
    protein, GFP, and is driven by a Tcf/Lef promoter.', 'The number of cells with
    activated Wnt pathway was quantified by flow cytometry analysis for GFP fluorescence
    in the presence and absence of treatment with curcumin, piperine, or curcumin
    + piperine compared to DMSO vehicle control.', 'Our group, and others, have previously
    demonstrated that one of the properties of stem/progenitor cells is their ability
    to survive under anchorage independent conditions and generate mammospheres.',
  'These mammospheres are composed of a small number of stem cells which self-renew,
    generating mammospheres on serial passage as well as progenitor cells capable
    of multilineage differentiation.', We determined the effects of varying concentrations
    of curcumin on mammosphere formation., 'Compared to DMSO control, 5 M curcumin
    inhibited mammosphere formation by 50%, while 10 M curcumin completely inhibited.',
  Piperine also inhibited mammosphere formation compared to controls but the effects
    were less pronounced than curcumin., The addition of 10 M piperine to 5 M of curcumin
    further reduced mammosphere formation compared to either agent separately., 'Furthermore,
    this decrease in mammosphere formation was not due to non-specific toxicity, since
    cell viability, as determined by trypan blue exclusion at 5 M curcumin, was 89%.',
  'Piperine, when added alone, had a more modest effect on mammosphere number; but
    also resulted in a decrease in mammosphere size.', a Primary mammospheres formed
    from unsorted normal human breast epithelial cells in suspension culture for 10
    days., 'Left picture incubation with curcumin 5 M, right picture piperine 5 M
    treatment.', 'b Primary mammosphere number  formed from unsorted normal human
    breast epithelial cells in suspension culture with curcumin ; 1C piperine treatment,
    1D curcumin plus piperine treatment


    We have previously shown that the ability of mammospheres to be serially passaged
    at clonal density is an indirect marker of stem cell self-renewal.', 'We, therefore,
    determined the effect of curcumin, piperine, or their combination when added during
    primary mammosphere formation on the ability of these cells to be serially passaged
    in mammospheres at clonal density.', The addition of 5 M curcumin + 10 M piperine
    to primary mammospheres inhibited the ability of cells isolated from these spheres
    to form secondary mammospheres by more than 50% compared to DMSO control., 'Furthermore,
    unlike DMSO controls, these cells were completely unable to form tertiary mammospheres.',
  This suggests that curcumin and piperine affect breast stem cell self-renewal and
    that this process is irreversible since the removal of these compounds did not
    restore the ability of these cells to form mammospheres upon serial passage.,
  Curcumin and piperine affect progenitor cell proliferation but not cellular differentiation.,
  The observation that piperine affected mammosphere size to a greater extent than
    mammosphere number  suggested that this compound might affect progenitor cell
    proliferation., 'In order to examine this in more detail, as well as to determine
    the effects of curcumin and piperine on cellular differentiation, we treated mammospheres
    with these dietary polyphenols and then determined the proliferative and differentiation
    capacity of these cells by plating mammosphere-derived cells in attached cultures
    on collagen-coated dishes in the presence of fetal calf serum.', 'We have previously
    shown that progenitor cells differentiate into myoepithelial and luminal epithelial
    cells, which can be identified by their cytokeratin expression.', Single cells
    derived from tertiary mammospheres were plated at clonal density on collagen-coated
    dishes., 'For the first 48 h of plating, 5 M curcumin + 10 M piperine were added,
    at which point they were removed and cells were then cultured in the absence of
    these compounds for an additional 10 days.', The addition of the dietary polyphenols
    resulted in a 50% reduction in the number of colonies formed., 'In contrast, when
    cells were allowed to attach and differentiate for 48 h prior to treatment with
    curcumin and piperine, there was no difference in colony number compared to DMSO
    treated controls.', 'Together with the data on mammosphere formation, these studies
    suggest that the effects of curcumin and piperine are primarily on undifferentiated
    stem and progenitor cells rather than on more differentiated cells.', Colonies
    generated at clonal density contained cells that were identified as luminal epithelial
    by CD 8  or myoepithelial as identified by CK 14  in mixed colonies containing
    both cell types., Addition of curcumin and piperine had no significant effect
    on the generation of these cell lineages., The previous experiments suggested
    that curcumin and piperine effects were primarily on stem/progenitor rather than
    differentiated cell populations., We have previously demonstrated that both normal
    and malignant breast stem/progenitor cells can be enriched by virtue of their
    expression of ALDH as assessed by the Aldefluor assay., 'We demonstrated that
    ALDH+, but not ALDH-cells, are capable of mammosphere formation and of generating
    mammary structures in the humanized fat pads of NOD/SCID mice.', 'In order to
    confirm that the effects of dietary polyphenols were on the primitive cell population,
    we isolated the ALDH+ component of primary human breast cells and examined the
    effect of polyphenols on mammosphere formation in this stem/progenitor-enriched
    population.', The addition of 5 M curcumin and 5 M piperine inhibited mammosphere
    formation by 50% compared to DMSO controls in this stem/progenitor-enriched population.,
  Mammosphere formation in these cells was completely inhibited by 10 M curcumin and
    10 M piperine., These studies provide further evidence for the enhanced sensitivity
    of stem/progenitor cells to curcumin + piperine., a Secondary and tertiary sphere

    and piperine., b Number of differentiated colonies formed from secondary sphere

    versus treatment for 48 h after plating., 'c Immunostaining for CK14 myoepithelial
    marker in blue and CK18 luminal marker in red in mixed differentiated colonies
    formed in the presence of curcumin and piperine


    To provide independent evidence that curcumin and piperine are able to reduce
    the stem cell populations, we examined the effects of these compounds on the proportion
    of breast cells expressing the stem cell marker ALDH1.', The known effects of
    piperine on cellular transport precluded the use of the functional Aldefluor assay
    to assess ALDH expression post treatment with piperine., 'However, we have previously
    demonstrated that the predominant Aldefluor isoenzyme expressed in breast stem
    cells is ALDH-1A1.', ALDH1 immunochemistry can thus be utilized to assess stem/progenitor
    cell number in normal and malignant breast tissues., We determined the proportion
    of cells expressing ALDH-1A1 by flow cytometry., As shown in Fig., '3b, 10 M curcumin
    reduced the proportion of ALDH-1A1 expressing cells from 7.3 to 1.5%.', Ten M
    piperine also decreased the percentage of ALDH-1A1 positive cells to 0.89% and
    the combination of curcumin and piperine further reduced ALDH-1A1 positive cells
    to 0.20%., These results confirm the previous studies demonstrating that curcumin
    and piperine are able to effect mammary stem/progenitor cells., a Primary mammosphere

    cells in suspension culture with curcumin and piperine treatment  compared to

    of unsorted normal human breast epithelial cells with curcumin and piperine treatment


    There is considerable evidence that the Wnt pathway regulates self-renewal in
    the breast as well as other organs.', 'In addition to canonical Wnt signaling,
    other signal transduction pathways, including Akt, may also regulate stem cell
    self-renewal through downstream Wnt signaling.', 'Furthermore, Wnt dysregulation
    results in mammary carcinogenesis in animal models and there is evidence for Wnt
    dysregulation in human breast tumors.', Previous studies have shown that curcumin
    inhibits Wnt signaling in other systems., 'We, therefore, determined the effect
    of curcumin and piperine on Wnt signaling in well-characterized breast cancer
    cell lines utilizing the TCF-Lef Topflash reporter system.', 'Exposure to 10 M
    curcumin for 12 h reduced GFP expression from 13% in DMSO vehicle controls to
    0.89%, while 10 M piperine inhibited GFP expression to 2.39%.', The combination
    of curcumin and piperine caused a further inhibition of GFP expression to 0.55%.,
  These studies indicate the potent inhibitory effect on Wnt signaling of both curcumin
    and piperine., a Number of spheres formed from MCF7 or SUM 159 cells in suspension
    culture with 12 h of curcumin and piperine treatment., 'b Green fluorescence positivity

    The cancer stem cell hypothesis proposes that cancers arise in tissue stem cells
    through dysregulation of the normally, tightly regulated process of self-renewal
    or in progenitor cells through acquisition of this capacity.', 'If stem/progenitor
    cells are targets for transformation, then strategies aimed at limiting these
    cell populations through inhibition of self-renewal represent rational cancer
    preventive strategies.', 'Furthermore, since these interventions are based on
    the regulation of self-renewal, rather than the induction of toxicity, they have
    the potential of being less toxic than compounds such as tamoxifen, which affect
    the bulk differentiated cell populations.', 'Our data suggest that the dietary
    polyphenols, curcumin and piperine, may have these characteristics.', 'We demonstrate
    that these dietary polyphenols affect normal stem/progenitor cells, as documented
    by decreased mammosphere formation upon serial passage and by decrease in the
    proportion of cells expressing the stem cell marker ALDH-1A1.', 'In contrast,
    these compounds had little or no effect on differentiated cells.', The relative
    lack of effect of these compounds on differentiated cells may account for their
    lack of toxicity in animal models and clinical studies., 'Cancer preventive agents
    such as curcumin and other polyphenols have been shown to have pleiotrophic mechanisms
    of action, including NFB suppression, Cox2 down regulation, and Wnt and Notch
    pathway downregulation.', We demonstrated that curcumin was able to inhibit Wnt
    signaling in MCF7 cells utilizing a TCF-Lef reporter assay system., 'These results
    support work in other systems showing the ability of curcumin to inhibit Wnt signaling,
    a pathway which we have previously demonstrated to play an important role in breast
    stem cell self-renewal and which is frequently dysregulated during breast carcinogenesis.',
  'In addition to curcumin, we demonstrate that the dietary polyphenol piperine also
    is able to inhibit breast stem cell self-renewal and Wnt signaling.', Previous
    studies have suggested that piperine could enhance curcumins effects by enhancing
    bioavailability through inhibition of curcumins efflux via P glycoprotein  efflux
    pump  as well as through the downregulation of NFB release., Our studies demonstrating
    that piperine affects mammosphere size and colony formation suggest that piperine
    may affect progenitor cell proliferation as well as enhance curcumins effects
    on breast stem cell self-renewal., 'If systemic bioavailability of curcumin can
    be improved to allow bioactive concentrations of curcumin and piperine in vivo,
    then this combination may serve as an effective cancer preventive intervention
    to limit stem cell self-renewal, since these cells and dysregulation of self-renewal
    pathways may be involved in carcinogenesis.', Strategies aimed at reducing stem
    cell number and inhibiting their self-renewal could be an effective approach in
    cancer prevention., 'If this is the case, then assays such as mammosphere formation
    and ALDH expression may serve as biomarkers for cancer prevention studies in clinical
    trials.', 'Curcumin, even at large doses, has been demonstrated to be non-toxic
    in clinical trials.', 'Piperine has been shown in a small, phase I clinical trial
    to enhance the systemic bioavailability of curcumin.', 'However, a more systematic
    phase I trial with pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and toxicity endpoints of
    repeated dosing of these agents in combination is still needed.', 'If proven safe
    and efficacious, dietary polyphenols could be an acceptable non-toxic long-term
    cancer risk reduction strategy.', 'This work was performed with NIH T32 grant,
    Innovative Concepts in Stem Cell Research Foundation Grant, and NIH KL2 grant
    support and support from the VA hospital.', We are grateful to Sabinsa Co. for
