text: [We examined the association between fat intake and breast cancer incidence
    in the Nurses Health Study II., 'We followed 88,804 women aged 2645 years from
    1991 to 2011 and documented incident breast cancers.', 'Dietary fat, assessed
    by questionnaires in 1991, was examined in relation to total, premenopausal, and
    postmenopausal breast cancers.', Multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards
    models were used to estimate relative risk  and 95 % confidence intervals., 'During
    20 years of follow-up, 2,830 incident invasive breast cancer cases were diagnosed.',
  Total fat intake was not associated with risk of breast cancer overall., 'After
    adjustment for demographic, anthropometric, lifestyle, and dietary factors, a
    positive association was observed between animal fat intake and breast cancer
    overall.', 'A positive association with animal fat intake was also seen among
    premenopausal women, but not among postmenopausal women.', 'Higher intakes of
    saturated fat and monounsaturated fat were each associated with modestly higher
    breast cancer risk among all women, and higher cholesterol intake was associated
    with higher premenopausal breast cancer risk.', 'However, the associations of
    saturated fat, monounsaturated fat and animal fat, were attenuated and non-significant
    after adjustment for red meat intake.', 'Intakes of other types of fat including
    vegetable fat, dairy fat, polyunsaturated fat, and trans fat were not associated
    with breast cancer risk.', Our finding suggests a positive association between
    early adult intake of animal fat and breast cancer risk., 'The potential influence
    of a high fat diet on risk of breast cancer has received considerable attention,
    but results from prospective cohort studies have generally provided little support
    for this hypothesis.', 'In a recent randomized controlled trial in Canada, 10
    years of reduction in dietary fat intake did not alter breast cancer risk in women
    with extensive mammographic density.', 'A lack of significant effect of a low
    fat diet was also seen in the Womens Health Initiative trial, but the low compliance
    with the dietary modification intervention makes interpreting the results more
    difficult.', 'However, most of the evidence has been based on diet during midlife
    and later.', Animal fat intake during early adulthood was associated with an increased
    risk of breast cancer in premenopausal women in Nurses Health Study II  cohort.,
  'The hypothesis that exposures between menarche and first pregnancy can be more
    important in breast cancer development has been supported by epidemiologic studies
    of women who survived the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and women treated
    for Hodgkins lymphoma; exposure to radiation in childhood and early adulthood
    was associated with subsequent risk of breast cancer, but exposure after age 30
    was weakly associated with increased risk.', 'In a previous analysis of the NHSII
    with 8 years follow-up and with 714 incident invasive breast cancer cases, animal
    fat intake in early adulthood was associated with higher risk of premenopausal
    breast cancer.', 'However, it was not clear whether this finding was due to early
    age at dietary assessment or the relatively young age of women at diagnosis of
    breast cancer.', 'In this updated analysis with longer follow-up and almost four
    times the number of cases, we were able to examine dietary fat intake during early
    adult life in relation to both premenopausal and postmenopausal breast cancer.',
  'Furthermore, we investigated the association between fat intake and breast cancer
    according to hormone receptor status.', 'The NHSII is a prospective cohort study
    established in 1989 with a total of 116,430 female registered nurses aged 2443
    years.', 'For this analysis, we started follow-up in 1991, when participants were
    first asked to complete the food frequency questionnaire.', 'The 95,452 women
    returned the 1991 FFQ.', 'Participants were excluded if they were postmenopausal
    in 1991, had reported a prior diagnosis of cancer, diabetes, coronary heart disease,
    or stroke before returning the 1991 questionnaire, had missing information on
    age or had an implausible total energy intake.', 'After exclusions, data from
    88,804 women were available for the analysis.', The follow-up rate was 95 % of
    total potential person-years of follow-up through 2011., The study protocol was
    approved by the institutional review boards of Brigham and Womens Hospital and
    Harvard School of Public Health., 'As part of the ongoing NHSII study, in 1991,
    1995, 1999, 2003, and 2007, participants completed a semi-quantitative FFQ with
    ~130 items about usual dietary intake and alcohol consumption during the previous
    year.', Nutrient intakes were computed by multiplying the frequency of consumption
    of each unit of food or beverage by the nutrient content of the specified portion
    size and then summing across all items., The questionnaire included information
    about specific types of margarine and types of fat used for baking and frying;
    this information was incorporated in the nutrient calculations., 'Nutrient values
    in foods were obtained from the US Department of Agriculture, food manufacturers,
    independent academic sources, and our own fatty acid analyses of commonly used
    margarines, cooking oils, and baked foods.', 'The food composition database was
    updated every 4 years, including updated fatty acid analyses, to account for changes
    in the food supply.', The percentage of energy from each type of fat and protein
    was calculated by dividing energy intake from each fat or protein by total energy
    intake., 'Cholesterol intake was expressed as mg/1,000 kcal.', The reproducibility
    and validity of intakes of fat and individual fat-contributing foods by FFQ have
    been evaluated elsewhere., 'In 92 participants in Nurses Health Study cohort,
    the correlations were examined between nutrients measured by the mean of three
    FFQs and mean of diet records obtained 6 years apart, which provides an assessment
    of long-term intake.', 'The correlations for energy-adjusted intakes, de-attenuated
    for variation in the diet records, were 0.83 with total fat and 0.95 for saturated
    fat.', Biennial follow-up questionnaires were used to ascertain newly incident
    breast cancers., Deaths were reported through family members and the postal service
    in response to the follow-up questionnaires or identified through annual review
    of the National Death Index., We asked all women who reported breast cancer  for
    confirmation of the diagnosis and for permission to review pathology reports and
    hospital record., 'Because of high confirmation rate  by medical record review,
    diagnoses confirmed by participants with missing medical record information were
    included in the analyses.', Cases of carcinoma in situ were excluded from the
    analyses., Estrogen  and progesterone  receptor status of the breast cancer were
    abstracted from pathology reports., 'Data on potential risk factors for breast
    cancer were obtained from the biennial NHSII questionnaires including age, height,
    weight, family history of breast cancer, smoking, race, menopausal status, postmenopausal
    hormone use, and oral contraceptive use.', Women were defined as premenopausal
    if they still had menstrual periods or had hysterectomy with at least one ovary
    remaining and were younger than 46 years  or younger than 48 years., Women were
    defined as postmenopausal if they reported permanent cessation of menstrual periods
    or had bilateral oophorectomy surgery., Women who had unknown menopausal status
    or had hysterectomy without bilateral oophorectomy were considered postmenopausal
    if they were 54 years or older  or 56 years or older., 'Person-year was calculated
    from the date of return of the 1991 questionnaire until the date of breast cancer
    diagnosis, death, or end of follow-up period, whichever came first.', The primary
    analysis used the 1991 baseline diet as this represents diet earliest in adult
    life., Participants were divided into quintile categories according to their fat
    or food group intake., 'Cox proportional hazards models, stratified by age in
    months and follow-up cycle, were used to estimate relative risk  and 95 % confidence
    intervals.', 'Multivariable models adjusted for several breast cancer risk factors,
    including race, family history of breast cancer in mother or sisters, history
    of benign breast disease, smoking, height, body mass index, age at menarche, parity
    and age at first birth, oral contraceptive use, and intakes of alcohol, energy
    and protein, and, for postmenopausal women, age at menopause and hormone use.',
  'For all women, we additionally adjusted for menopausal status.', 'All variables
    except race, height and age at menarche were updated from follow-up questionnaires.',
  'Because fat intake may increase risk of breast cancer over a long period of time,
    for a sensitivity analysis, we also calculated premenopausal cumulative averaged
    intakes of fat using the 1991, 1995, 1999, 2003, and 2007 dietary data, stopping
    updating at menopause.', SAS version 9.3  was used for all analyses., The median
    value for each quintile was used for tests for trend for each category of fat
    intake as a continuous variable., 'We examined the interaction between total,
    animal and vegetable fat intakes and established breast cancer risk factors by
    including a cross-product interaction term between risk factors and intake of
    total, animal and vegetable fat in the multivariable model.', P values for the
    tests of interactions were calculated by using likelihood ratio test with one
    degree of freedom., 'To examine differential associations of intakes of total
    fat, animal fat and vegetable fat with breast cancer risk by hormone receptor
    status, we used Cox proportional cause-specific hazards regression model with
    a duplication method for competing risk data.', 'This method permits estimation
    of separate associations of fat intake with both ER and PR receptors positive  and
    receptors negative, and tests whether dietary fat intake has statistically different
    regression coefficients for different tumor subtypes.', All P values were two-sided.,
  'During 1,725,439 person-years of follow-up of 88,804 women, a total of 2,830 incident
    cases of invasive breast cancer  were identified.', The mean age of participants
    in 1991 was 36.4 years., Table 1 shows age-standardized distribution of risk factors
    for breast cancer according to quintiles of animal fat intake in 1991., 'Women
    who consumed a higher amount of animal fat were more likely to smoke, to have
    3 children or more, to have lower age at first birth, and to have a larger BMI
    than women with a lower intake.', 'Women who consumed a higher amount of animal
    fat were also less likely to drink alcohol, and less likely to have a history
    of benign breast disease, than women with a lower intake.', "Age-standardized
    distribution of potential risk factors for breast cancer according to animal fat
    intake in 1991 in women enrolled in Nurses Health Study II  \n\nAmong all women,
    total fat intake was non-significantly associated with breast cancer risk in multivariable
    analysis.", 'In both the age-adjusted and multivariable analyses, intake of total
    fat in 1991 was not significantly associated with risk of either premenopausal
    or postmenopausal breast cancer.', 'In multivariable analysis, higher intake of
    animal fat was significantly associated with higher risk of breast cancer overall.',
  'Among premenopausal women, we also observed a positive association between animal
    fat and breast cancer incidence.', Further adjustment for vegetable fat intake
    did not alter the results., 'However, after adjustment for red meat intake, these
    associations were no longer statistically significant.', 'In a sensitivity analysis
    using the cumulative average of premenopausal intake, there was a significant
    association between animal fat and risk of premenopausal breast cancer.', Cumulative
    average of premenopausal intake of animal fat was modestly associated with breast
    cancer among all women., For vegetable fat and dairy fat neither baseline intakes
    nor cumulative average of premenopausal intakes was associated with risk of either
    premenopausal or postmenopausal breast cancer., "RR and 95 % CI for breast cancer
    according to quintile of fat intake in 1991 in women  \n\nP trend calculated with
    median intake of each variable in each quintile as a continuous variable\n\nMultivariable
    model was stratified by age in months at start of follow-up and calendar year
    of the current questionnaire cycle and was simultaneously adjusted for race, family
    history of breast cancer in mother or sisters, history of benign breast disease,
    smoking, height, BMI, age at menarche, parity and age at first birth, oral contraceptive
    use, alcohol intake, energy, and percentage of energy from protein.", 'Among postmenopausal
    women, we also adjusted for hormone use  and age at menopause.', "Among all women,
    we also adjusted for menopausal status, hormone use  and age at menopause \n\nHigher
    intakes of saturated fat and monounsaturated fat were each associated with modestly
    higher risk of breast cancer among all women.", 'However, after adjustment for
    red meat intake, these associations were no longer statistically significant.',
  'Intake of cholesterol was associated with higher risk of premenopausal breast cancer,
    but this association was attenuated after accounting for intake of red meat.',
  'Intakes of polyunsaturated fat, trans-unsaturated fat, and long-chain omega-3 fatty
    acids were not significant predictors of either premenopausal or postmenopausal
    breast cancer.', "RR and 95 % CI for breast cancer according to quintile of specific
    types of fat intake in 1991 in women  \n\nPtrend calculated with median intake
    of each variable in each quintile as a continuous variable \n\nMultivariable model
    was stratified by age in months at start of follow-up and calendar year of the
    current questionnaire cycle and was simultaneously adjusted for race, family history
    of breast cancer in mother or sisters, history of benign breast disease, smoking,
    height, BMI, age at menarche, parity and age at first birth, oral contraceptive
    use, alcohol intake, energy, and percentage of energy from protein.", 'Among postmenopausal
    women, we also adjusted for hormone use  and age at menopause.', "Among all women,
    we also adjusted for menopausa status, hormone use  and age at menopause \n\nWe
    also evaluated the associations using multivariable nutrient density model approach.",
  'We included simultaneously total energy intake, and percent of energy intake from
    animal fat and vegetable fat, alcohol and protein in the multivariable model.',
  We found that substitution of 5 % energy intake from animal fat for an equivalent
    energy intake from carbohydrate was associated with higher risk of breast cancer
    among all women., Substituting animal fat intake for an equivalent energy from
    protein or vegetable fat and also substituting saturated fat for monounsaturated
    or polyunsaturated fat were not associated with increasing risk of breast cancer
    before or after menopause., Information on ER receptor status was available for
    81 %  and PR receptor status for 80 %  of the breast cancer cases., 'Table 4 presents
    the associations between total, animal and vegetable fat and breast cancer according
    to hormone receptor status; data are presented for tumors with both ER and PR
    positive receptors  and for both negative receptors  as those with discordant
    receptor status were too few for analysis.', 'We did not find any significant
    heterogeneity between tumors characterized by receptor status for total fat, animal
    fat or vegetable fat intakes in either premenopausal or postmenopausal breast
    cancer.', "Multivariable RR and 95 % CI of subtypes of breast cancer according
    to fat intake in 1991, expressed as a continuous variable  \n\nMultivariable model
    was stratified by age in months at start of follow-up and calendar year of the
    current questionnaire cycle and was simultaneously adjusted for race, family history
    of breast cancer in mother or sisters, history of benign breast disease, smoking,
    height, BMI, age at menarche, parity and age at first birth, oral contraceptive
    use, alcohol intake, energy, and percentage of energy from protein.", 'Among postmenopausal
    women, we also adjusted for hormone use  and age at menopause.', "Among all women,
    we also adjusted for menopausal status, hormone use  and age at menopause \n\nWe
    also examined whether the association between intakes of total, animal and vegetable
    fats and breast cancer risk differed by levels of breast cancer risk factors including
    family history of breast cancer, BMI, oral contraceptive use, history of benign
    breast disease, alcohol intake, age at first birth, and hormone use.", 'Among
    all women, the association between animal fat intake and breast cancer risk was
    modified by BMI.', 'In normal weight women, higher intake of animal fat was significantly
    associated with higher incidence of breast cancer.', 'But among overweight and
    obese women, there was no significant association.', 'In women with alcohol intake
    of 5 g/day, higher intake of total fat was significantly associated with higher
    incidence of breast cancer.', 'In addition, higher intake of total fat was significantly
    associated with higher risk of breast cancer among women with history of benign
    breast disease.', Such association was not observed in women without history of
    benign breast disease., 'Moreover, in premenopausal women, the association between
    vegetable fat and breast cancer was modified by family history of breast cancer.',
  Higher intake of vegetable fat was associated with lower risk of breast cancer in
    women without family history of breast cancer., Higher intake of animal fat was
    also associated with higher risk of premenopausal breast cancer in women with
    age at first birth 30 years., 'In this prospective cohort study, we assessed the
    relation of dietary fat intakes and breast cancer diagnosed before and after menopause.',
  Our findings suggest that higher intake of animal fat was associated with modestly
    higher risk of breast cancer., 'Intakes of saturated fat and mono-unsaturated
    fat, found in most animal fat, were also related to increased risk of breast cancer
    among all participants, but these associations were weaker and not significant
    after accounting for intake of red meat.', 'Cholesterol intake was associated
    with higher risk of premenopausal breast cancer, but this association was attenuated
    after accounting for intake of red meat.', 'Higher animal fat intake, relative
    to an equivalent reduction in the amount of energy from carbohydrates, was significantly
    associated with greater breast cancer risk.', Premenopausal intakes of total fat
    or types of fat were not associated with postmenopausal breast cancer risk., Smith-Warner
    et al., 'examined the relation between fatty acids and breast cancer incidence
    using a pooled data of 8 cohorts with 7,329 incident invasive breast cancer cases
    among over 350,000 women.', They found no increase in risk with increasing animal
    fat intake., 'Similarly, in an analysis of diet during midlife and later, Kim
    et al., did not find any association between fat intake and postmenopausal breast
    cancer in a 20-year follow-up of women in the Nurses Health Study cohort.', No
    significant association between animal fat intake and breast cancer was observed
    in a recently published meta-analysis of animal fat consumption and breast cancer
    that combined these two studies with data from other cohort studies., 'However,
    none of these studies were able to focus on fat intake in early adult life.',
  'In an early analysis from NHSII, Cho et al.', 'reported a positive association
    between animal fat intake and premenopausal breast cancer, and this association
    was more pronounced among women with ER+/PR+ breast cancers.', The extended follow-up
    of NHSII provided an opportunity to address the issue of early adulthood diet
    in relation to both premenopausal and postmenopausal breast cancer with higher
    number of cases., 'On the basis of the findings from our study and evidence available
    from generally null findings described above, intake of animal fat in early adult
    life may be associated more with risk of premenopausal breast cancer than with
    breast cancer after menopause.', 'In addition, caution is appropriate when interpreting
    the association between animal fat and breast cancer because this association
    could be due to specific foods contributing to animal fat.', 'Red meat has been
    associated with risk of breast cancer, including a previous report from this cohort.',
  'Adjustment for red meat attenuated the risk associated with high consumption of
    animal fat, and thus animal fat may be a surrogate for other constituents of red
    meat.', 'Notably, dairy fat was not associated with risk of breast cancer.', Potential
    limitations also need to be considered., 'Because the participants were predominantly
    white, educated US adults, we cannot determine whether our findings are generalizable
    to other race or ethnic groups; however, it is unlikely that the biology underlying
    this association differs by race.', 'Major strengths of this study include the
    large number of cases, long length of follow-up, and the ability to examine subtypes
    of breast cancers.', The detailed prospective and updated assessments of diet
    and lifestyle factors allowed adjustment for many potential confounders., 'Furthermore,
    information on diet was obtained before breast cancer was reported, which minimizes
    recall bias.', 'In summary, focusing on early adult diet and considering breast
    cancer incidence before and after menopause, our findings suggest that high intake
    of animal fat and cholesterol may be associated with risk of premenopausal breast
    cancer but not postmenopausal breast cancer.', 'However, these associations may
    be due to other constituents of red meat.', The study was supported by the National
    Institutes of Health Grant., 'The study sponsors were not involved in the study
