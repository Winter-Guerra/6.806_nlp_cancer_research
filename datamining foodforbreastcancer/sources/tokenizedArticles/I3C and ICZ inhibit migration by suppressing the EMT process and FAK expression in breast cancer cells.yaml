text: [Indole-3-carbinol  and indole carbazole  are major bioactive food components
    in cruciferous vegetables., 'Although previous studies have demonstrated the anticancer
    activity of I3C and ICZ in various types of cancer cells, the manner in which
    indole compounds regulate migration or related epithelial-to-mesenchymal transitions  has
    yet to be determined.', 'In this study, we investigated the effects of I3C and
    ICZ on migration using breast cancer cells.', 'Pretreatment with I3C and ICZ significantly
    inhibited the migration of breast cancer cells without cytotoxicity, as measured
    by monolayer scratch assay.', 'In addition, I3C and ICZ decreased vimentin  and
    focal adhesion kinase  mRNA expression, while increasing E-cadherin  expression.',
  Matrix metalloproteinase -2 and -9 activity was also reduced by I3C and ICZ., 'Taken
    together, we propose that I3C and ICZ pretreatment inhibits the migration of breast
    cancer cells through suppression of the EMT process and reduced MMP activity by
    repressing FAK expression.', Our findings suggested that I3C and ICZ are potential
    compounds for inhibition of breast cancer cell migration.]
