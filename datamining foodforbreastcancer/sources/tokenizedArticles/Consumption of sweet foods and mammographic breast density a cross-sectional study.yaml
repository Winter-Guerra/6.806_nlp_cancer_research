text: ['The increasing consumption of sugar worldwide seems to lead to several health
    problems, including some types of cancer.', 'While some studies reported a positive
    association between sweet foods intake and breast cancer risk, little is known
    about their relation to mammographic density, a strong breast cancer risk factor.',
  This study examined the association of sweet foods and drinks intake with MD among
    776 premenopausal and 779 postmenopausal women recruited at mammography., 'A food-frequency
    questionnaire was used to assess intake of sweet foods, sugar-sweetened beverages
    and spoonsful of sugar added.', Percent and absolute breast density were estimated
    using a computer-assisted method., Multivariate generalized linear models were
    used to evaluate associations., 'All models were adjusted for potential confounders,
    including age and body mass index.', 'For increasing quartiles of sugar-sweetened
    beverages intake, adjusted-mean absolute density was respectively 32, 34, 32 and
    36 cm2 among all women  and 43, 46, 44 and 51 cm2 among premenopausal women.',
  'For increasing quartiles of sweet foods intake, adjusted-mean percent density was
    respectively 16, 16, 17 and 19% among postmenopausal women.', No association was
    shown between intake of spoonsful of sugar added and MD., Our results suggest
    that an increase in sweet foods or sugar-sweetened beverage intake is associated
    with higher MD., It has been recently suggested that consumption of foods high
    in added sugar is the source of many of the greatest health problems in the world
    today., 'Sugar consumption has tripled over the past 50 years and the World Health
    Organization, in collaboration with the FAO, has published some recommendations
    to reduce this consumption worldwide.', 'In fact, excessive sugar intake seems
    to lead to human health problems like the ones associated with metabolic syndrome  and
    several types of cancer, including breast cancer.', 'At a cellular level, it has
    been shown that sugar would enhance cellular proliferation and migration, induce
    DNA damage and increase inflammation.', All of these adverse effects are related
    to cancer pathogenesis., 'Several studies, although not all, have found a positive
    association between sweet foods/drinks and breast cancer risk among premenopausal
    women, postmenopausal women  or both combined.', 'In all of the studies that found
    a positive association, the frequencies of consumption of several sweet foods
    or drinks were summed into one  or two  groups.', 'In contrast, among the studies
    that showed no association, most of them have examined some sweet foods and drinks
    separately.', 'These results may suggest that the sum of sweet items consumed
    would be associated with breast cancer risk rather than a specific sweet food
    item intake, therefore it would be the amount of sweet items intake that has an
    effect, and not a specific food.', Mammographic density  is a well-established
    breast cancer risk factor and it appears to act as an intermediate marker., 'Considering
    that elevated MD may reflect an increase in the proliferation of fibroglandular
    breast cells, it is likely that a high intake of sweet foods and sugar-sweetened
    beverages may lead to an increase in MD.', 'Up to now, two studies conducted among
    pre- and postmenopausal women have evaluated the association between consumption
    of sweet items and MD.', Voon et al., 'observed a positive association between
    intake of sweet foods and MD, while Masala et al.', found a non-significant positive
    association between intake of spoonsful of sugar added and MD., 'The present study
    aimed at clarifying the relation of intake of sweet foods, sugar-sweetened beverages
    and spoonsful of sugar added to beverages and foods with MD among premenopausal
    and postmenopausal women.', 'While study population and recruitment procedures
    have been described elsewhere, here is a summary.', Women of the study population
    have been recruited among those who received a screening mammogram between February
    2001 and March 2002 in two private radiology clinics in Quebec City., 'Eligible
    women had to be classified as premenopausal or postmenopausal according to the
    Nurses Health Study criteria, have no personal history of cancer or breast surgery,
    have no endocrine diseases, have never taken selective estrogen-receptor modulators,
    not be pregnant, and have not used exogenous hormones in the three months preceding
    the mammography.', 'Of the 1574 women who have participated in the original study,
    we excluded 11 women who did not completed the food frequency questionnaire, five
    women who followed a special diabetic diet and three women who reported extremely
    high  or extremely low  caloric intake for the purpose of the present study.',
  Thus the present analysis includes 1555 women., The study was approved by the Research
    Ethics Review Board-Hpital Saint-Sacrement at the CHU de Qubec., All study participants
    provided written informed consent., 'Height, weight, waist and hip circumferences
    were measured by a trained nurse at recruitment.', Information on breast cancer
    risk factors and physical activity were collected during a phone interview performed
    by trained interviewers., Physical activity was assessed using the Nurses Health
    Study II Activity and Inactivity Questionnaire  and then expressed as metabolic
    equivalent  hours per week., 'Data on diet were collected with a 161-item, validated
    self-administered semi-quantitative FFQ.', 'A standard serving size was assigned
    for each item and its frequency of consumption over the previous year was selected
    between never, less than one serving per month, 13 servings per month, one serving
    per week, 24 servings per week, 56 servings per week, one serving per day, 23
    servings per day or more than three servings per day.', 'From this FFQ, 14 items
    were classified as sweet foods, four items as sugar-sweetened beverages  and two
    items as spoonsful of sugar added to beverages and foods.', Mammograms were digitized
    using a Kodak LS-85 laser film scanner., All mammograms were blindly evaluated
    by a trained reader within one month of each other., 'MD was assessed using interactive
    threshold Cumulus software, a computer assisted method.', A craniocaudal view
    of the right or left breast was randomly selected and MD was measured for each
    participant in batches of 100 images., 'Two measurements of MD were obtained:
    the proportion of the breast showing tissue density  and the absolute amount of
    dense tissue.', Duplicates of images were introduced in each batch in order to
    evaluate reproducibility of measurement., 'The intra-class correlation coefficients
    were 0.98 and 0.98 and the inter-group coefficients of variation were 4% and 5%
    for percent and absolute density, respectively.', 'The frequency of consumption
    of each sweet item was transformed in number of servings per week, using the middle
    of each category when necessary.', 'We created four groups of foods by adding
    the number of servings per week of 1- all 14 sweet foods, 2- all four sugar-sweetened
    beverages, 3- the two items related to spoonsful of sugar added and 4- all items
    aforementioned.', Partial Spearman correlations between the number of servings
    per week and MD as continuous variables were estimated., 'As we found no specific
    categorization in the literature and that most of studies on sweet foods and breast
    cancer risk have used percentile categorization, the number of servings per week
    of each group was categorized in quartiles by using all women.', 'Percent and
    absolute density were square root-transformed except for percent density among
    premenopausal women, in order to obtain a normal distribution of these variables.',
  'Then, multivariate-adjusted means of MD by quartile were estimated using generalized
    linear models, and the linear trend across quartiles was tested by using linear
    contrast with the median of servings per week within each of the quartiles as
    the value.', Means of MD are presented as back-transformed values., 'For statistically
    significant results, additional multivariate-adjusted models were performed using
    categorizations of servings per week that are more useful for public health purposes.',
  'Potential confounders identified a priori and included in the adjusted models and
    correlations were age at mammography, body mass index, age at menarche, age at
    first full-term pregnancy, number of full-term pregnancies, duration of breastfeeding,
    duration of use of oral contraceptive, duration of use of hormonal therapy, alcohol
    intake, family history of breast cancer, number of biopsies, smoking status, education,
    waist-to-hip ratio, physical activity, calorie intake  and menopausal status  when
    applicable.', 'Further adjustment for intake of calcium, intake of vitamin D,
    season at time of mammography  and use of multivitamin-multimineral supplements  had
    little or no influence on the estimates.', 'Therefore, they were not added in
    the models.', 'Because the possible modifying effect of BMI and physical activity
    was reported in the literature, we also conducted exploratory analyses evaluating
    partial Spearman correlations of intake of sugar-sweetened beverages and sweet
    foods  with MD stratified by BMI  and by physical activity  and &gt;median).',
  All tests were 2-sided and a p-value ; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.,
  All statistical analyses were carried out using the SAS  software system., Characteristics
    of the 1555 women included in the analyses are described in Table 1., 'In summary,
    the mean age of the women was 54.1 years, with a mean of 46.7 years for premenopausal
    women and 61.4 years for postmenopausal women.', 'As expected, postmenopausal
    women had lower percent and absolute densities compared with premenopausal women.',
  'On average, postmenopausal women consumed more sweet foods, spoonsful of sugar
    added  and all sweet items grouped  than premenopausal women, with a higher total
    caloric intake per day.', The frequency of sugar-sweetened beverages intake was
    similar in both groups., The associations between consumption of sugar-sweetened
    beverages and MD are shown in Table 2., 'Among all women, ascending quartiles
    of sugar-sweetened beverages intake was positively associated with percent density
    ) and absolute density ).', 'For increasing weekly servings of sugar-sweetened
    beverages, MD was respectively 26.2, 27.5, 27.7, 29.2%  and 31.6, 32.7, 32.9,
    36.4 cm2.', 'When stratified by menopausal status, the positive association between
    sugar-sweetened beverages intake and absolute density remained significant among
    premenopausal ) but not among postmenopausal women ).', 'For increasing weekly
    servings of sugar-sweetened beverages, absolute density was respectively 42.8,
    43.9, 48.3 and 50.8 cm2 among premenopausal women.', Table 2., 'Associationsa

    foods and MD are also shown in Table 2., 'Among postmenopausal women, ascending
    quartiles of sweet foods intake was positively associated with percent density
    ).', 'For increasing weekly servings of sweet foods, percent density was respectively
    16.2, 16.3, 17.4 and 19.1%.', 'However, we observed no association between sweet
    foods consumption and absolute density among postmenopausal women ).', 'Furthermore,
    the consumption of this group of foods was not associated with any measure of
    MD among all or premenopausal women.', The consumption of spoonsful of sugar added
    and the total of all sweet items were not associated with MD among all women or
    within strata of menopausal status., Partial Spearman correlations of intake of
    sweet foods or sugar-sweetened beverages with percent or absolute density stratified
    by BMI or physical activity are detailed in Additional file 1., 'Regarding the
    positive correlation observed between the intake of sugar-sweetened beverages
    and MD among all women, this correlation remained significant only among the stratum
    of less active women for percent density  but not for absolute density.', 'As
    to the correlation observed between sweet foods intake and percent density among
    postmenopausal women, this positive correlation remained significant only for
    those who are less active.', No other significant correlation was observed within
    strata of BMI or physical activity., Additional file 1., 'Partial Spearman correlations
    of sugar-sweetened beverages and sweet foods intake with MD stratified by BMI
    and physical activity among all, premenopausal and postmenopausal women.', 'In
    this study, we found that sugar-sweetened beverage intake was positively associated
    with MD among all women or limited to premenopausal women.', We also found that
    the intake of sweet foods including mostly desserts was positively associated
    with MD in postmenopausal women., 'Among all women, those who had a sugar-sweetened
    beverages intake of more than three servings per week presented a 3% difference
    in percent density compared with those who did not drink this type of beverages.',
  'By comparison, it has been shown that healthy women at high risk of developing
    breast cancer who received tamoxifen for 54 months had a reduction of 6.4% in
    MD, and since tamoxifen can reduce the risk of breast cancer by 30-50% in high-risk
    women, an increase of about 3% in MD is not negligible in terms of breast cancer
    risk.', 'In our population the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages is not
    very high, but in the United States, a citizen consumes on average 12 servings
    of soda per week  of which 58% contain sugar.', 'To our knowledge, the association
    between consumption of sweet foods and MD has been assessed by one group other
    than ours.', 'In this cross-sectional study of 64 Malaysian women aged between
    35 and 75 years, Voon and Chelliah analyzed the association between consumption
    of sweet foods summed in one group and MD divided in two groups  and found a significant
    positive association.', 'Unfortunately, there is no mention of which sweet foods
    were included in their group.', 'Moreover, no stratified analysis by menopausal
    status was performed due to their small sample size.', Several studies have examined
    the link between the consumption of desserts and breast cancer risk  and found
    a positive association., 'Among them, only one had stratified their analyses by
    menopausal status  and one had stratified by age  which can serve as a proxy for
    menopausal status.', Tavani et al., 'found a positive association between dessert
    intake and breast cancer risk for all women and, when stratified by age, this
    association was significant only among women aged 60 years or more.', 'In contrast,
    Bradshaw et al.', found a positive association between dessert intake and breast
    cancer risk among premenopausal and postmenopausal women with a slightly higher
    effect among premenopausal women., 'In our study, the positive association between
    sweet foods intake and MD is shown for postmenopausal only.', 'Thus, our results
    suggested that a higher consumption of sweet foods may lead to higher MD and eventually
    higher breast cancer risk, at least for postmenopausal women.', 'Since we observed
    no association between sweet foods intake and MD among premenopausal women, MD
    may not be the only pathway that could link sweet foods intake to breast cancer
    risk.', 'The group of sweet foods is composed in majority of items that have a
    lot of sugar but also a lot of fat, and the consumption of fat has been positively
    associated with breast cancer risk and MD among postmenopausal in some studies.',
  'However, the role of fat consumption in breast cancer risk or on MD is still controversial.',
  'In a longitudinal study, Masala et al.', assessed the relation between consumption
    at baseline of a group of foods named sugar  derived from a FFQ of 160 items and
    MD evaluated 5 years after enrollment according to Wolfs classification  and low
    )., Their study population was composed of 1668 women aged 53 years on average
    and 62.4% were postmenopausal at baseline., 'They found that women among the highest
    tertile of sugar consumption had higher MD, but the association was not statistically
    significant.', 'In our population, we observed a similar tendency with the consumption
    of spoonsful of sugar added, which is comparable to their sugar group, which was
    not statistically significant, agreeing with their results.', 'Unfortunately,
    among studies on breast cancer risk, none of them made an analysis with consumption
    of spoonsful of sugar added similar to ours.', 'Nonetheless, a possible explanation
    for the lack of association between the consumption of spoonsful of sugar added
    and MD may be related to the composition of table sugar.', 'Contrary to commercial
    desserts and sweet drinks which contain more grams of fructose than glucose, table
    sugar contains equal amounts of fructose and glucose.', Fructose and glucose are
    both simple sugars but they are absorbed and metabolized by different pathways
    in the organism and some authors have suggested that fructose could be more harmful
    than glucose to human health due to this difference., It has been recently suggested
    that excessive consumption of fructose may increase breast cancer risk., 'In the
    present study, we observed a positive association between sugar-sweetened beverages
    intake and MD among all women and particularly among premenopausal women.', 'To
    our knowledge, this relationship was not assessed in another study.', 'Nonetheless,
    our results are consistent with those from Witte and colleagues  who found a positive
    association between sweetened beverages intake and breast cancer risk among premenopausal
    women.', 'Similarly, Potischman et al.', 'found a positive association with consumption
    of sweet items that included beverages, foods and spoonsful of sugar added among
    their study population composed of premenopausal women only.', They evaluated
    the contribution of each component of that food group and found that the major
    contributor in percentage was regular cola soft drinks., 'However, the creation
    of a new group of full-sugar drinks  did not reveal any association.', 'In contrast
    to the sweet foods group, the sugar-sweetened beverages group is composed of drinks
    mostly made of sugar  and water suggesting that the positive association shown
    with the consumption of those drinks and MD or breast cancer risk among premenopausal
    women would be more related to the consumption of sugar, particularly fructose.',
  Stratified analyses by BMI and physical activity reveal that our association of
    sugar-sweetened beverages or sweet foods intake with MD is stronger among all
    less active women or among postmenopausal less active women respectively., Two
    breast cancer risk studies stratified their analyses by BMI and physical activity.,
  One found that the association between intake of desserts or spoonsful of sugar
    and breast cancer risk did not differ within strata of BMI  and the other one
    found a nearly doubling risk with increased intake of desserts among more active  compared
    with inactive women  and a stronger association among women with a lower BMI.,
  'However, these analyses relied on different thresholds for stratification and did
    not assess associations by menopausal status, making comparison difficult.', Several
    biological mechanisms may explain the higher MD observed in this study with higher
    sweet items intake., 'Intake of sugar seems to have an effect on cellular proliferation
    in general  and also on breast tumor cells in vitro, and increases incidence of
    tumors in animal models.', 'Moreover, an in vitro study on breast tumor cells
    has shown that while fructose appears to increase cell invasion and migration,
    glucose seems to increase cell proliferation.', These observations suggest that
    intake of sweet items could enhance cellular proliferation in breast tissues and
    could increase MD., 'In humans, excessive sugar consumption is also associated
    with an increase in production of insulin  that, in turn, can increase insulin-like
    growth factor-I, a growth factor that has mitogenic and anti-apoptotic effects
    on cells.', These effects were seen in both normal and abnormal breast cells.,
  Wang et al., found that feeding mice with a high sucrose diet could promote the
    proliferation and tumorigenesis of intestinal epithelial cells by increasing insulin
    and IGF-I levels., 'In fact, IGF-I levels have been positively associated with
    breast cancer risk  and MD, particularly among premenopausal women.', 'Regarding
    insulin, a positive association with breast cancer risk has been shown for postmenopausal
    women.', 'However, the possible effect of insulin levels on MD has not yet been
    shown.', 'Another possible mechanism of action of sugar consumption is through
    its effect on circulating levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D D), the principal circulating
    vitamin D metabolite.', 'This mediated action is likely because sugar-sweetened
    beverages, particularly colas, have been shown to decrease levels of serum 25D
    in an animal model  and in a study involving children.', 'At a cellular level,
    vitamin D D as its biomarker) has been found to have anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic
    effects.', 'Furthermore, low levels of 25D were found to be associated with an
    increase in breast cancer risk and MD among premenopausal women.', All of these
    hypotheses need to be confirmed with additional studies., This study has several
    strengths., 'Firstly, the size of the study sample is relatively large and the
    equal number of premenopausal and postmenopausal women allows stratified analyses
    with enough power.', 'Secondly, the breast mammographic images are of great quality.',
  Almost all mammograms were done with equipment  accredited by the Canadian Association
    of Radiology in order to satisfy the high quality standards of the Quebec breast
    cancer screening program., 'Thirdly, all measures of MD were done using a computer-assisted
    method with a trained reader without any information on women in a short period
    of time.', 'Furthermore, the readers reliability of readings was high.', 'Thus,
    misclassification of MD is unlikely and, if present, it should not have biased
    our results.', 'Fourthly, the FFQ used in this study was validated in several
    studies for its accuracy.', 'Finally, adjustment was made for factors known or
    suspected to be related to MD and for total caloric intake to control for most
    of the potential confounding biases.', 'Since all of the women in this study were
    Caucasian, analyses were not adjusted for ethnicity.', This study has also some
    limitations., 'We aimed at clarifying the effect of consumption of sweet foods
    on MD because they contain a lot of sugar, but some of these foods also contain
    other nutrients, like fat, that may cause residual confounding.', 'Thus, the association
    observed between sweet foods intake and MD among postmenopausal women could be
    due to nutrients other than sugar.', 'However, the sugar-sweetened beverages group
    is mostly composed of sugar.', 'Therefore, the association found with sugar-sweetened
    beverage intake and MD among premenopausal women supports our hypothesis that
    higher consumption of sugar can lead to higher MD.', Misclassification in the
    frequency of consumption of food items is possible with the use of the FFQ., Participants
    have to give an estimation of the frequency of consumption of an item over the
    previous year., 'However, differential bias is unlikely because answers inaccuracies
    can hardly be related to MD and the misclassification can only lead to an underestimation
    of the effect.', 'Furthermore, the cross-sectional design of this study does not
    allow causal interpretation and prospective studies are necessary to establish
    causality.', We also cannot exclude that our findings may be due to chance because
    we evaluated several associations., Type I errors or false-positive results are
    therefore possible., 'Finally, it is p that power was insufficient for stratified
    analyses by BMI and physical activity in each menopausal group and therefore these
    results should be interpreted with caution.', This study found that higher consumption
    of sweet foods among postmenopausal women and higher consumption of sugar-sweetened
    beverages among premenopausal women are associated with MD., 'Given the small
    number of studies that examined the relationship between intake of sweet items
    and MD, these associations need to be confirmed by other studies.', 'The difference
    in MD found in our study might not be very high, but it may not be neglected in
    a global strategic plan to prevent breast cancer by reducing MD.', 'Considering
    the worldwide increase in sugar consumption and all the health problems it is
    related to, it is important to continue research on this subject and begin to
    inform the public about the adverse effects of sugar consumption.', "MD: Mammographic
