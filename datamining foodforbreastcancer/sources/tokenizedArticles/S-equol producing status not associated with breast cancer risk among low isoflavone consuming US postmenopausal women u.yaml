text: ['Soy foods are the richest sources of isoflavones, mainly daidzein and genistein.',
  Soy isoflavones are structurally similar to the steroid hormone 17-estradiol and
    may protect against breast cancer., 'S-equol, a metabolite of the soy isoflavone
    daidzein, has a higher bioavailability and greater affinity for estrogen receptor  than
    daidzein.', 'Approximately one-third of the Western population is able to produce
    S-equol, and the ability is linked to certain gut microbes.', 'We hypothesized
    that the prevalence of breast cancer, ductal hyperplasia, and overall breast pathology
    will be lower among S-equol producing, as compared with nonproducing, postmenopausal
    women undergoing a breast biopsy.', We tested our hypothesis using a cross-sectional
    study design., Usual diets of the participants were supplemented with 1 soy bar
    per day for 3 consecutive days., Liquid chromatography-multiple reaction ion monitoring
    mass spectrometry analysis of urine from 143 subjects revealed 25  as S-equol
    producers., 'We found no statistically significant associations between S-equol
    producing status and overall breast pathology, ductal hyperplasia, or breast cancer.',
  'However, the mean dietary isoflavone intake was much lower  than in previous reports.',
  'Given that the amount of S-equol produced in the gut depends on the amount of daidzein
    exposure, the low soy intake coupled with lower prevalence of S-equol producing
    status in the study population favors toward null associations.', Findings from
    our study could be used for further investigations on S-equol producing status
    and disease risk.]
