text: ['Polyphenols, such as phenolic acid, anthocyanin and proanthocyanidins, have
    both nutraceutical properties and functional significance for human health.',
  Identification of polyphenolic compounds and investigation of their genetic basis
    among diverse rice genotypes provides the basis for the improvement of the nutraceutical
    properties of whole rice grain., 'This review focuses on current information on
    the identification, genetic diversity, formation and distribution patterns of
    the phenolic acid, anthocyanin, and proanthocyanidins in whole rice grain.', 'The
    genetic analysis of polyphenol content and antioxidant capacity allows the identification
    of several candidate genes or quantitative trait loci  responsible for polyphenol
    variation, which may be useful in improvement of these phytochemicals by breeding.',
  'Future challenges such as how to mitigate the effects of climate change while improving
    nutraceutical properties in whole grain, and how to use new technology to develop
    new rice high in nutraceutical properties are also presented.']
