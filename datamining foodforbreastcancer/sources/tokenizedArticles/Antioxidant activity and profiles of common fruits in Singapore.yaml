text: ['Thirty-eight types of fruits commonly consumed in Singapore were systematically
    analysed for their hydrophilic oxygen radical absorbance capacity, total phenolic
    content, ascorbic acid  and various lipophilic antioxidants.', Antioxidant composition
    and concentration varied widely across different fruits., Many of the tropical
    fruits tested were high in antioxidants., 'Amongst all fruits tested, sapodilla  had
    the highest H-ORAC and TPC whilst guava had the highest AA per gram fresh weight.',
  'Papaya, red watermelon and cantaloupe had the highest -cryptoxanthin, lycopene
    and -carotene per gram fresh weight, respectively.', 'On the other hand, durian
    and mangosteen were high in tocopherols and tocotrienols, respectively.', 'Based
    on consumption data, Chinese Singaporeans appear to have a higher intake of carotenoids
    and tocopherols rich fruits compared to the US population.', 'As fruits are a
    rich source of diverse antioxidants, efforts to promote consumption of a variety
    of fruits should be continued for public health benefits.']
