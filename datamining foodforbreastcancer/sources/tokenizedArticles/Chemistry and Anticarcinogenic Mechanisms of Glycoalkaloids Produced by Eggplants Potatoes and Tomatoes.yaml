text: ['Inhibition of cancer can occur via apoptosis, a genetically directed process
    of cell self-destruction that involves numerous biomarkers and signaling pathways.',
  'Glycoalkaloids are nitrogen-containing secondary plant metabolites found in numerous
    Solanaceous plants including eggplants, potatoes, and tomatoes.', 'Exposure of
    cancer cells to glycoalkaloids produced by eggplants, potatoes, and tomatoes  or
    their hydrolysis products  inhibits the growth of the cells in culture  as well
    as tumor growth in vivo.', 'This overview comprehensively surveys and consolidates
    worldwide efforts to define the following aspects of these natural compounds:  their
    prevalence in the three foods;  their chemistry and structureactivity relationships;  the
    reported factors  associated with apoptosis of bone, breast, cervical, colon,
    gastric, glioblastoma, leukemia, liver, lung, lymphoma, melanoma, pancreas, prostate,
    and squamous cell carcinoma cell lines in vitro and the in vivo inhibition of
    tumor formation and growth in fish and mice and in human skin cancers; and  future
    research needs.', 'The described results may make it possible to better relate
    the structures of the active compounds to their health-promoting function, individually,
    in combination, and in food, and allow the consumer to select glycoalkaloid-containing
    food with the optimal content of nontoxic beneficial compounds.', The described
    findings are expected to be a valuable record and resource for further investigation
    of the health benefits of food-related natural compounds., 'glycoalkaloids; -solamargine;

    Carcinogenesis is a sequential multistage cellular process consisting of tumor
    initiation, tumor promotion, and tumor progression.', 'Because tumor promotion
    may be the only reversible event during cancer development, its suppression may
    be regarded as an effective way to inhibition carcinogenesis.', 'Because glycoalkaloids,
    in addition to inhibiting cancer cells, may also inhibit normal cells, a key consideration
    for their use in cancer prevention and treatment should be the ratio of effective
    preventive or therapeutic to toxic dose.', 'Moreover, whether glycoalkaloids from
    different food sources can additively or synergistically enhance anticarcinogenic
    effects of anticancer drugs is also an active area of research.', 'The Solanaceae
    plant family includes eggplant, potato, and tomato.', 'Eggplant and tomato fruit
    and potato tubers and their processed products serve as major, inexpensive low-fat
    food sources, providing energy, protein, fiber, vitamins, and bioactive compounds
    including glycoalkaloids.', 'Glycoalkaloids are secondary plant metabolites that
    may be involved in the defense of the plants against phytopathogens, including
    bacteria, fungi, and viruses.', 'Glycoalkaloids are produced in the edible parts
    of the plants as well as in leaves, flowers, roots, and, in the case of potatoes,
    also in sprouts.', They generally occur in the plant as steroidal glycosides.,
  'Eggplants produce the trisaccharides -solamargine and -solasonine, potatoes, the
    trisaccharides -chaconine and -solanine, and tomatoes, the tetrasaccharides -tomatine
    and dehydrotomatine.', Uncultivated  potato varieties produce additional glycoalkaloids.,
  'The reason why nature created two glycoalkaloids and not one in the three cultivated
    plants may be because the evolutionary approach makes it possible for the two
    glycoalkaloids to exert the observed synergistic effects described below, thus
    allowing the plant to have a smaller total amount of the two glycoalkaloids while
    maintaining resistance against phytopathogens.', Figure 1., Structures of the
    aglycones and glycoalkaloids found in Solanum., 'Previously, we evaluated about
    18 eggplant, potato, and tomato glycoalkaloids and some of their hydrolysis products  for
    their ability to inhibit the growth  of several human cancer cell lines.', All
    of the test compounds inhibited growth of the tumor cells but at different rates.,
  These studies seemed to have stimulated interest in the chemopreventive mechanisms
    of the anticarcinogenic activities in vitro in cancer cells and in vivo in tumors.,
  'Because humans may consume at least six glycoalkaloids in their diet from the mentioned
    three widely consumed foods, there is a need to further define the possible beneficial
    effects of glycoalkaloids consumed individually, in combination, and as part of
    the diet against cancer cells and tumors.', 'To help stimulate needed studies
    further, the main objective of this review is to unify the scattered information
    on the anticarcinogenic potential of the food-related glycoalkaloids.', It should
    be noted that glycoalkaloids are reported to exhibit other beneficial as well
    as adverse effects in animals and humans., These aspects are beyond the scope
    of this review., They are comprehensively covered in our previous publications.,
  Solanum melongena Linn., 'is an herbaceous plant with coarsely lobed leaves, white
    to purple flowers, and widely consumed fruit that can be eaten raw, cooked, or
    pickled.', 'The following selected studies show that eggplants contain several
    classes of bioactive compounds, including anthocyanidins, flavonoids, saponins,
    and glycoalkaloids.', 'Individual or combinations of the bioactive compounds are
    probably responsible for the reported analgesic, antianaphylactic, anti-inflammatory,
    antioxidant, antipyretic, intraocular pressure reducing, central nervous system
    depressing, hypolipodemic, and hypotensive properties of eggplants, reviewed by
    Das and Barua and Sun et al.', We do not know whether eggplants also possess anticarcinogenic
    properties., 'The fruits of the eggplant are one of the most widely consumed vegetables
    in the world, with the most popular species being Southeast Asia-domesticated
    S. melongena L. These authors used liquid chromatographymass spectrometry methods
    to compare the contents of the major eggplant glycoalkaloids  of S. melongena
    to the allied accession of the Africa-cultivated S. aethiopicum and S. macrocarpon.',
  'The results show that  fruits of S. aethiopicum and S. melongena contained  0.584.56
    -solamargine and 0.171.0 -solasonine and  the corresponding much higher values
    for S. macrocarpon are 124197 and 1623, respectively, suggesting that this accession
    might not be safe for consumption.', A related study of 10 eggplant lines and
    three allied species  confirmed that the allied species had higher glycoalkaloid
    content than the widely consumed eggplants and that the glycoalkaloid content
    generally increased during fruit development and ripening., Bajaj et al., 'used
    colorimetry to determine an average glycoalkaloid content of 21 eggplant varieties,
    whose concentrations  ranged from 6.25 to 20.5 or 3.3-fold variation from the
    lowest to the highest value.', These authors also found that the crude protein
    content ranged from 0.77 to 3.63  and that high-glycoalkaloid eggplants tasted
    bitter., A British study used colorimetry to determine the average glycoalkaloid
    content of two eggplant samples of about 8 mg/100 g fresh weight., Kintia and
    Shvets isolated and characterized three steroidal saponins from seeds of Moldavian
    S. melongena., These compounds probably contribute to the observed bioactivities
    of eggplants., 'An Egyptian study used colorimetry and thin-layer chromatography  to
    identify three glycoalkaloids  in S. melongena fruit, whose concentrations varied
    with the harvesting season.', These authors also found that fruit infected with
    Botrytis cinerea fungi contained the solanine hydrolysis product -solanine., 'French
    scientists used colorimetry and TLC to determine the total glycoalkaloid and furastanol
    saponin content of six eggplant varieties, the concentrations of which  ranged
    from 1.0 to 7.2 and 3.0 to 11.2, respectively.', Eanes et al., 'developed an HPLC
    method for the separation and determination of the following eggplant glycoalkaloids:
    solamargine, solasonine, chaconine, and solanine and their aglycones, solasodine
    and solanidine.', 'Extracts of S. melongena and S. linnaeanum were used to determine
    the method of recovery, limit of detection, and limit of quantification.', 'In
    agreement with our studies with potato and tomato glycoalkaloids, grilling or
    boiling of eggplants did not result in significant changes in the total glycoalkaloid  content.',
  Nikolic et al., describe a liquidliquid system for the acid hydrolysis of potato
    glycoalkaloids from potato sprouts that yields 1.46 g of solanidine per 100 g
    of dried sprouts., Attoumbre et al., describe a centrifugal partition chromatography
    procedure for the isolation of solanidine from glycoalkaloid hydrolysates of potato
    skins and sprout extracts., Kuo et al., 'found that adding auxin phytohormones
    to cell culture tissues of the Solanum lyratum plant induced increases in the
    production of solanidine and solasodine levels, suggesting the availability of
    a new method for the production of steroidal alkaloids.', Friedman and Levin reviewed
    analytical methods for investigating potato glycoalkaloids and bioactive calystegine
    alkaloids., Figure 2 shows the glycoalkaloid content of fresh and processed potatoes.,
  Figure 2., Makeup of total glycoalkaloids in a small sampling of a variety of potatoes
    and potato products., 'Due to the large standard deviations, ANOVA showed no statistical
    differences.', Adapted from ref 6., Copyright 2006 American Chemical Society.,
  'The glycoalkaloid known as tomatine consists of a mixture of two glycoalkaloids:
    -tomatine and dehydrotomatine.', 'In the present study, we will use the term tomatine
    for the 10:1 mixture.', Both compounds are present in tomato fruit and leaves.,
  Immature green tomatoes contain up to 500 mg of tomatine per kilogram of dry weight.,
  The tomatine content of cherry tomatoes  is several fold greater than that of larger
    size standard varieties., 'Because tomatine is largely degraded as the tomato
    ripens, the levels in red tomatoes are much lower, up to about 5 mg/kg.', Consumers
    of high-tomatine green tomatoes and pickled green tomatoes consume high amounts
    of tomatine., 'A red tomato variant indigenous to the Andes mountains of Peru
    has a very high tomatine content, 5005000 mg/kg dry wt.', These tomatoes are consumed
    without apparent acute toxic effects., Figure 3 lists the -tomatine content of
    a small sampling of fresh and processed tomatoes., Figure 3., -Tomatine content
    per serving of a variety of fresh and processed tomato  products., Bars sharing
    the same symbol are not significantly different; p ; 0.05., Adapted from ref 20.,
  Copyright 1995 American Chemical Society., 'The use of gene manipulation to introduce
    desirable traits into tomatoes, such as tolerance to stress and pesticides and
    resistance to phytopathogens, raises questions about the tomatine content of the
    transgenic tomatoes.', 'Our results, and those by other investigators, indicate
    that tomatine levels of transgenic tomatoes were not significantly different from
    those observed in the standard varieties grown under the same field conditions.',
  'By contrast, a long-term  study revealed that organically grown tomatoes had higher
    average tomatine content than their standard counterparts, suggesting that soil
    composition and environmental conditions seem to affect the tomatine content in
    tomato.', The tomatine levels of tomatoes in both cropping systems ranged from
    4.29 to 111.85 g/g dry wt or a 26-fold variation from the highest to the lowest
    value., A related study found that the tomatidine content of 11 analyzed samples
    was higher in conventional tomatoes than that in organic tomatoes., These results
    suggest the possibility of future anticancer and anticholesterol studies with
    selected high-tomatine and high-tomatidine red tomatoes., 'We carried out studies
    designed to optimize the acid hydrolysis of the tetrasaccharide chain of tomatine
    to products with three, two, one, and zero sugar groups.', 'A 20 min hydrolysis
    of tomatine in 1 N HCl at 100 C was used for the formation of the trisaccharide
    1-tomatine, the disaccharide -tomatine, and the monosaccharide -tomatine.', 'Efforts
    to isolate the other theoretical possible trisaccharide, 2-tomatine, were unsuccessful,
    apparently because its xylose sugar is degraded during hydrolysis.', A 70 min
    hydrolysis time achieved complete removal of the tetrasaccharide side chain to
    produce the aglycone tomatidine., 'Because tomatine was stable to acid hydrolysis
    at 37 C, it may be stable in the acidic pH environment of the human gut.', The
    hydrolysis products are formed by sequentially cleaving the sugars from lycotetraose.,
  'With this background on the structures and composition of glycoalkaloids from eggplants,
    potatoes, and tomatoes and some of their hydrolysis products, we will now briefly
    describe reported studies designed to determine the anticarcinogenic properties
    and mechanisms of action of the eggplant glycoalkaloids -solamargine and -solasonine,
    their common aglycone solasodine, the potato glycoalkaloids -chaconine and -solanine
    and hydrolysis products including the aglycone solanidine, and the tomato glycoalkaloids
    -tomatine and hydrolysis products including aglycone tomatidine against cancer
    cells in culture  and some animal and human tumors in vivo.', 'Here, we briefly
    review mechanistic aspects associated with eggplant glycoalkaloids produced in
    some eggplant varieties.', 'In addition to eggplants, numerous herbal and medicinal
    plants synthesize solamargine and solasonine.', 'In fact, most of the anticancer
    studies mentioned below were done with glycoalkaloids isolated from these sources
    and not from eggplants.', 'Because the glycoalkaloids from different plant sources
    are identical, we will also mention selected anticancer studies in cells, rodents,
    and human using glycoalkaloids from herbal and medicinal plants grown in different
    parts of the world.', 'These include S. incanum, S. lycocarpum, and S. nigrum.',
  'Apoptosis is a genetically controlled, regulated, and conserved form of cell death,
    where the cell first undergoes nuclear and cytoplasm condensation with blebbing
    of the plasma membrane, DNA fragmentation, and breakdown of membrane-enclosed
    fragments known as apoptotic bodies, which are then engulfed rapidly by neighboring
    cells or macrophages.', The cell activity thus participates in its own destruction.,
  'In many cells, but apparently not with tomatine, activation of caspases by eggplant
    glycoalkaloids may be the ultimate effector mechanism in apoptotic pathways.',
  TNF exhibits antiproliferative effects against various cancer cell lines in vitro
    and in vivo., The trisaccharide solamargine and the corresponding mono- and diglycosides
    preferentially inhibited the uptake of tritiated thymidine by cancer cells relative
    to that by normal lymphocyte cells., These results and the observed morphological
    changes in the cells indicate that the action against the cancer cells involves
    cell lysis., 'On the basis of a structureactivity and molecular modeling study,
    Chang et al.', 'concluded that the 2-rhamnose moiety of solamargine  acts by penetrating
    the cell membrane by diffusion and then triggers death by apoptosis of human hepatoma
    Hep3B cells by changing the dihedral angle of the glycosidic bond, suggesting
    that the carbohydrate side chains of glycoalkaloids seem to govern the affinity
    to steroid human necrosis factor receptors and gene expression associated with
    carcinogenesis.', A related study suggests that cells in the G/M phases are highly
    susceptible to solamargine-mediated apoptosis and that parallel upregulation of
    tumor necrosis factor receptors TNFR-I or TNFR-II on the Hep3B cells may be an
    independent mechanism of solamargine-mediated apoptosis., Blankemeyer et al.,
  used a cell assay to measure the changes in membrane potentials of frog embryos
    induced by solamargine and solasonine., Experiments with solasonine at pH 6 and
    8 suggest that the unprotonated form of solasonine is involved in the membrane
    potential effect and that the relative potencies of the two glycoalkaloids are
    similar for the observed frog embryo effects., 'Solamargine and solasodine inhibit
    cell-mediated immune functions  activity of human peripheral mononuclear cells,
    possibly suggesting that enhancement of the immune system could contribute to
    apoptosis.', In vivo studies support this suggestion., 'These authors found that
    groups of mice administered solasodine rhamnosyl glycosides one-half an hour after
    Sarcoma 180 inoculation caused total remission of the cancer, whereas mice treated
    with sarcoma but without the glycosides all died within 20 days.', 'Moreover,
    10 of 12 of cured mice were resistant to the reintroduction of terminal doses
    of cancer.', 'Because, in addition to apoptosis, the glycosides stimulated lasting
    immunity against cancer similar to that observed with a vaccine containing Corynbacterium
    parvum, it seems that the stimulation of immunity contributed to the observed
    in vivo anticancer effects.', It seems that solasodine glycosides could contribute
    to the management of diseases such as malignancy and also be used as a prevention
    therapy., 'Below, we mention the role of immunity in the bioactivity of glycoalkaloids.',
  Ding et al., isolated six glycoalkaloids from Solanum nigrum., 'The following four
    induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis in the gastric cancer cell line MGC-803: solasonine,
    1-solasonine, solamargine, and solanigroside P. The number and location of the
    -l-rhamnose moiety and the type of sugar in the side chain as well as the presence
    of an OH group on the steroidal alkaloid backbone influenced relative potency.',
  'The suggested mechanism of apoptosis seems to be related to the recognized anticarcinogenic
    events: activation of caspase-3, cell cycle arrest, upregulation of the ratio
    of antiapoptotic Bax to Bcl-2 proteins, and downregulation of the mutant p53 gene.',
  'In an effort to define how solamargine mediates cytotoxicity via oncosis in human
    K562 leukemia and squamous cell carcinoma KB cells, Sun et al.', used the MTT
    assay to measure cytotoxicity and the release of lactate dehydrogenase  and the
    uptake of propidium iodide  to determine leakage of cytoplasm content., 'Cytotoxicity
    and membrane disruption were triggered rapidly within minutes at the same rate
    by 10 M solamargine, suggesting that apoptosis seems to be initiated by plasma
    membrane perturbation.', 'These authors also reported that exposure of the leukemia
    cells to 10 M solamargine for 30 min induced a 7-fold increase in intracellular
    calcium concentration, downexpression of Bcl-2 and upregulation of Bax, caspase-3,
    and caspase-9 activities.', These results and the observed decrease in membrane
    potential and release of cytochrome c suggest that an induced lysosomalmitochondrial
    death pathway is involved in the cytotoxicity., 'Because the cells do not show
    an early increase in reactive oxygen species  production before apoptosis, the
    lysosomal rupture does not seem to be associated with oxidative stress.', 'Solamargine
    isolated from Solanum nigrum inhibited the growth and induced apoptosis of human
    hepatoma Hep G2 and SMMC-7721 cells lines via cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase
    and upregulation of caspase-3 expression, the so-called executioner caspase and
    mediator of DNA fragmentation and nuclear condensation, suggesting that the glycoalkaloid
    could be used to treat liver cancer.', 'Solamargine exhibited superior cytotoxicity
    in four human lung cancer cell lines, with IC50 values ranging from 3 to 7.2 M,
    and increased binding of TNF- and TNF- to the lung cancer cells.', 'The glycoalkaloid
    induced release of cytochrome c, downregulation of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL
    proteins, increase in caspase-3 activity, and DNA fragmentation.', These observations
    and the additional finding that TNF-resistant lung cancer cells became susceptible
    after exposure to solamargine suggest that the compound should be studied for
    its therapeutic value against human lung cancers., 'Other investigators reported
    that the anticarcinogenic activity of solamargine is associated with the downregulation
    of HER-2 and upregulation of Fas and tumor necrosis factor receptor  expression,
    which triggers the mitochondrial-mediated cell apoptosis pathway and sensitizes
    human lung cancer cell and A540 adenocarcinoma cells to chemotherapy, and that
    it potentiated the death of lung cancer H661 cells induced by the drugs herceptin
    and epirubicin as well as the death of lung and breast cancer cells induced by
    the drug cisplatin.', A detailed mechanistic study revealed that solamargine inhibited
    growth and induced apoptosis of non-small-cell lung cancer cells in a time- and
    dose-dependent manner and increased phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein
    kinase  in a time-dependent manner., 'It also inhibited phosphorylation and protein
    expression of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, which was abrogated
    by SB203580, a specific inhibitor of p38 MAPK, and induced protein expression
    of the p21 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors.', 'Although silencing of Stat3
    had no further effect, exogenous expression of Stat3 overcame the effect on cell
    proliferation.', 'These results show that solamargine inhibits proliferation and
    induces apoptosis in lung cancer cells through p38 MAPK-mediated suppression of
    phosphorylation and protein expression of Stat3, followed by induction of Stat3s
    downstream effector, p21.', An investigation by Li et al., 'on the role of the
    p53 gene in the proapoptotic action of solamargine in human U2OS cells using the
    microculture tetrazolium  and several other bioassays found that solamargine-induced
    apoptosis was associated with chromatin condensation, formation of apoptotic bodies,
    exposure of phosphatidylserine on the extracellular surface, increase in mRNA
    and protein levels of p53 and Bax, reduction in the expression of Bcl-2, loss
    of mitochondrial membrane potential, release of cytochrome c, and activation of
    caspase-3 and -9 enzymes.', These results suggest that solamargine activates the
    mitochondria-mediated apoptotic pathway via both p53 transcription-dependent and
    -independent mechanisms., The authors conclude that the mechanism by which solamargine
    activates the p53 gene remains unclear., The Chinese medicinal herbs Solanum incanum
    and Solanum nigrum Linn., 'contain the steroidal glycoalkaloids solamargine, solanine,
    and solasonine.', An ethanol extract of S. nigrum was found to inhibit the growth
    of MCF-7 breast cancer and to induce apoptosis of tumor cells., 'Solanine isolated
    from this plant was found to inhibit tumors in the following cell lines : Hep
    G2 human carcinoma, SGC-7901 human gastric carcinoma, and LS-174 human large intestine
    cancer cells.', The inhibitory action of solanine was accompanied by a decrease
    in the content of Bcl-2 protein in the Hep G2 cells., These data show that Hep
    G2 cells showed the greatest sensitivity to inhibition by solanine., Munari et
    al., 'evaluated the antiproliferative effects of solamargine and solasonine against
    the following tumor cell lines: murine melanoma  and human colon carcinoma, breast
    adenocarcinoma, cervical adenocarcinoma, hepatocellular liver carcinoma, and glioblastoma.',
  'Solamargine showed the most pronounced activity, with IC50 values ranging from
    4.58 to 18.23 g/mL.', 'The lowest IC50 values  were observed against Hep G2, with
    an IC50 value for solamargine of 4.58 and for solasonine of 6.01.', These results
    show that the test substances behaved as broad-spectrum anticarcinogens., 'Three
    solasodine glycoside derivatives prepared by transglycosylation exhibited strong
    cytotoxicity against four cancer cell lines, suggesting that they might serve
    as lead candidates for cancer chemotherapy.', Multidrug resistance  is one of
    the major causes of the failure of conventional treatments of cancer., 'MDR is
    often associated with the expression of P-glycoprotein, which acts as a drug efflux
    pump to transport intracellular drugs out of cells, thus imparting drug resistance
    to tumor cells.', 'These authors found that solamargine has broad-spectrum cytotoxic
    activity against multiple MDR cell lines  and that the P-gpactin association pathway
    might be involved in the apoptosis, suggesting that the glycoalkaloid bypasses
    the MDR mechanism.', 'Solamargine synergistically enhanced the effects of cancer
    drugs including methotrexate, 5-florouracil, cisplatin, and epirubicin in several
    cancer cell lines, suggesting that it may have potential use in combination therapy
    for breast and lung cancers.', A mixture of solasodine glycosides was effective
    in vivo against murine Sarcoma 180., Mice in terminal stages of cancer became
    symptom free by a single dose., 'Because rhamnose inhibited the therapeutic effect,
    the authors suggest that the binding of glycosides to tumor cells may be mediated
    through the rhamnose carbohydrate of the trisaccharide side chain of solamargine.',
  'A 0.005% solasodine glycoside cream applied topically was effective in causing
    regression of human basal cell carcinomas  and squamous cell carcinomas  without
    adverse effect on the liver, kidneys, or blood system.', 'A solamargine-rich extract
    from S. incanum induced apoptosis in human SCC cells cells by upregulating the
    expression of TNFRs and Fas and downstream adaptors of TNF- and Fas signaling
    pathways, triggering the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, upregulating cytochrome
    c and Bax, and downregulating Bcl-X.', A once-daily application of a topical solamargine
    gel to the skin caused the disappearance of UVB-induced microinvasive SCCs in
    27 of 30 hairless mice within 10 weeks., 'In addition, the gel cured 10 of 13
    patients with actinic keratosis  after 16 weeks.', The authors suggest that the
    extract may be an ideal candidate for the treat of AK with minimal side effects
    on normal skin., Goldberg et al., 'effectively treated cancer of the human penis,
    called Bowens disease, with low concentrations of a mixture of solasodine glycosides
    and liquid nitrogen.', Punjabi et al., 'evaluated, in a double-blind randomized
    study, the safety and efficacy of a cream containing a 0.005% mixture of solasodine
    glycosides  for the treatment of basal cell carcinoma in humans  at 10 centers
    in the United Kingdom.', The primary efficacy end point was histologically confirmed
    clearance of the basal cell carcinoma at the end of 8 week treatment., 'The results
    show that the treatment is a safe therapy for basal cell carcinoma, with a cure
    rate of 66% at 8 weeks and 78% at a 1 year follow-up.', 'In a related in vivo
    study, Tiossi et al.', used an extract of Solanum lycocarpum fruit containing
    45% each of solamargine and solasonine to prepare a topical formulation and to
    optimize its penetration in vitro to porcine skin and in vivo to the skin of hairless
    mice., 'The results showed that pH 6.5 was optimal for delivery and penetration
    of skin in both animal models, suggesting that the formulation might be useful
    for topical therapy of skin disorders.', A review of the literature concludes
    that there is insufficient evidence at present to make recommendations on the
    topical use of solasodine glycoalkaloids for skin cancers., 'Continued research
    on the efficacy of treatments is needed, including histologic confirmation of
    clearance, long-term follow-up, and comparison with surgical outcomes.', 'The
    aglycones solasodine and tomatidine isolated from the South African medicinal
    plant Solanum aculeastrum Dunal inhibited the growth of HeLa, MCF7, and HT29 cancer
    cell lines.', The IC50 value of the two compounds combined was lower  than the
    value for solasodine but not for that of tomatidine., 'Here, we will briefly describe
    reported anticarcinogenic properties and mechanisms of the bioactive potato compounds
    in cells  and laboratory animals.', Friedman et al., describe methods for the
    isolation of large amounts of pure -chaconine and -solanine from Dejima potatoes
    and for the extraction and analysis of total glycoalkaloid content from five fresh
    potato varieties., 'These compounds were then evaluated in experiments using a
    MTT assay to assess the anticarcinogenic effects of  the isolated pure glycoalkaloids
    separately,  artificial mixtures of the two glycoalkaloids, and  the total glycoalkaloids
    isolated from each of the five potato varieties.', 'All samples tested reduced
    the number of the following human cell lines: cervical, liver, lymphoma, and stomach  cancer
    cells and normal liver  cells.', 'The results show that  the effects of the glycoalkaloids
    were concentration-dependent in the range of 0.110 g/mL,  -chaconine was more
    active than -solanine,  some mixtures exhibited synergistic effects, whereas others
    produced additive ones,  the different cancer cells varied in their susceptibilities
    to destruction, and  the destruction of normal liver cells was generally lower
    than that of liver cancer cells.', The decreases in cell populations were also
    observed visually by phase contrast microscopy., This study demonstrated for first
    the time the individual and synergistic anticancer properties of the two major
    glycoalkaloids present in all commercial potato varieties and processed potato
    products., Figure 4., Morphological changes induced by glycoalkaloid treatments
    in Hep G2 and AGS cancer cells., The cells were pretreated with either -chaconine
    and -solanine  for 48 h and stained with sulforhodanine B  for 30 min., Morphological
    alterations were recorded from phase-contrast microscopic observations., Adapted
    from ref 2., Copyright 2005 American Chemical Society., 'As part of an effort
    to improve plant-derived foods such as potatoes, eggplants, and tomatoes, the
    antiproliferative activities against human colon  and liver  cancer cells of a
    series of structurally related individual compounds were examined for the first
    time using a MTT assay.', The objective was to assess the roles of the carbohydrate
    side chain and aglycone part of Solanum glycosides in influencing inhibitory activities.,
  'Evaluations were carried out with four concentrations each  of the potato trisaccharide
    glycoalkaloids -chaconine and -solanine; the disaccharides -chaconine, -chaconine,
    and -solanine; the monosaccharide -chaconine and their common aglycone solanidine;
    the potato tetrasaccharide glycoalkaloid dehydrocommersonine; the potato aglycone
    demissidine; the tomato tetrasaccharide glycoalkaloid -tomatine, the trisaccharide
    1-tomatine, the disaccharide -tomatine, the monosaccharide -tomatine, and their
    common aglycone tomatidine; the eggplant glycoalkaloids -solamargine and -solasonine
    and their common aglycone solasodine; and the steroidal alkaloid jervine.', 'All
    compounds were active in the assay, with the glycoalkaloids being the most active,
    and the hydrolysis products, less so.', The effectiveness against the liver cells
    was greater than that against the colon cells., Potencies of -tomatine and -chaconine
    at a concentration of 1 g/mL against the liver carcinoma cells were higher than
    those observed with the anticancer drugs doxorubicin and camptothecin., 'This
    comprehensive report on anticarcinogenic potencies of a large number of glycoalkaloids
    and their hydrolysis products  seems to have stimulated worldwide interest in
    the anticarcinogenic properties of potato and tomato glycoalkaloids and their
    mechanisms of action, as indicated by the numerous studies originating from different
    countries described below.', -Chaconine induced apoptosis of HT-29 human colon
    cancer cells in a time- and concentration-dependent manner., The authors also
    showed that caspase-3 activity and the active form of caspase-3 were increased
    12 h after -chaconine treatment., 'In addition, caspase inhibitors prevented -chaconine-induced
    apoptosis, whereas apoptosis was potentiated by an extracellular signal-regulated
    kinase  inhibitor.', Results from the same study indicated that -chaconine reduced
    the phosphorylation of ERK., It therefore seems that -chaconine induces apoptosis
    of HT-29 cells through inhibition of ERK followed by activation of caspase-3.,
  Reddivari et al., 'found that -chaconine at 5 g/mL and gallic acid at 15 g/mL  exhibited
    potent antiproliferative properties and increased cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor
    p27 levels in two prostate cancer cell lines, LNCaP and PC3,  induced poly ribose
    polymerase cleavage and caspase-dependent apoptosis in LNCaP cells and caspase-independent
    apoptosis through nuclear translocation of endonuclease G in both LNCaP and PC-3
    cells, and  activated JNK, a response that played a major role in the induction
    of caspase-dependent apoptosis in LNCaP cells.', 'These observations suggest that
    apoptosis induced by whole potato extracts in prostate cancer cell lines may be,
    in part, due to -chaconine and gallic acid.', 'In a study by Lu et al., -chaconine
    inhibited the proliferation of bovine aortic endothelial cells  in a dose-dependent
    manner, and nontoxic doses markedly suppressed cell migration, invasion, and tube
    formation.', '-Chaconine also reduced the expression and activity of MMP-2, involved
    in angiogenesis, and potently suppressed the phosphorylation of JNK, phosphatidylinositide-3
    kinase, and Akt, but it did not affect the phosphorylation of ERK and p38.', 'Furthermore,
    the authors demonstrated that -chaconine significantly increased the cytoplasmic
    level of inhibitors of IB and decreased nuclear factor B, suggesting that it could
    inhibit NF-B activity.', 'It seems that -chaconine inhibits migration, invasion,
    and tube formation of BAECs by reducing MMP-2 activity and JNK and PI3K/Akt signaling
    pathways and inhibiting NF-B activity, suggesting its potential for use in antiangiogenic
    cancer therapy.', Metastasis is the spread of cancer cells from the initial or
    primary site of the disease to another part of the body., Shih et al., 'found
    that -chaconine  inhibited lung adenocarcinoma A549 cell invasion, migration,
    and phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase  and Akt,  did not affect phosphorylation
    of extracellular signal regulating kinase  and p38, and  significantly decreased
    the nuclear level of NF-B and the binding ability of NF-B, suggesting that the
    inhibition of cell metastasis occurs by a reduction of matrix metalloproteinase-2  and
    matrix metalloproteinase-9  activities involving suppression of the phosphoinositide
    3-kinase/Akt/NF-B  signaling pathway


    Ji et al.', evaluated the effect of -solanine isolated form the nightshade plant  on
    the IC50 values of three digestive system tumor cell lines., 'The results show
    that  the IC50 values for the cell lines Hep G2, SGC-7901, and LS-174 were 14.47,
    &gt;50, and &gt;50 g/mL, respectively,  the induced apoptosis rate in Hep G2 cells
    was 6.0, 14.4, 17.3, 18.9, and 32.2%, respectively,  cells in the G/M phases of
    the cell cycle disappeared, whereas the number of cells in the S phase increased
    significantly for treated groups and the expression of Bcl-2 protein decreased.',
  The target of solanine in inducing apoptosis in Hep G2 cells seems to be mediated
    by the inhibition of the expression of Bcl-2 protein., -Solanine markedly increased
    in a dose-dependent manner the content of caspase-3 and concurrently decreased
    that of Bcl-2 in Hep G2 liver cancer cells., This observation suggests that -solanine
    induces cell apoptosis by suppressing the activity of Bcl-2 and activating the
    caspase-3 protease., Studies by Ji et al., 'suggest that solanine-induced apoptosis
    in Hep G2 cells is turned on by reduction of the cell membrane potential, which
    opens ion channels that transport calcium ions down a concentration gradient,
    resulting in an increase in their concentration in the cell.', Studies by Sun
    et al., 'on the mechanism that may govern the anticarcinogenic activity of -solanine
    in pancreatic cancer cells in vitro and in a nu/nu nude mouse model against human
    pancreatic cells show that the glycoalkaloid  inhibited the growth of the cancer
    cells through caspase-3-dependent mitochondrial apoptosis,  promoted the opening
    of the mitochondrial membrane permeability transition pore  by downregulating
    the Bcl-2/Bax ratio, which resulted in the release of cytochrome c and Smac from
    the mitochondria into the cytosol to process the caspase-3 zymogen into its activated
    form, and  decreased the expression of tumor metastasis proteins, specifically
    MMP-2 and MMP-9, in the cells.', 'In a related study, Lv et al.', investigated
    the anticarcinogenic effect of -solanine against human pancreatic cancer cells
    in vitro and in vivo., 'In vitro, -solanine  inhibited the proliferation of PANC-1,
    sw1990, MIA PaCa-2 cells in a dose-dependent manner as well as cell migration
    and invasion at nontoxic doses;  suppressed the expression of MMP-2/9, extracellular
    inducer of matrix metalloproteinase CD44, eNOS, and E-cadherin in PANC-1 cells,  significantly
    decreased vascular endothelial growth factor  expression and tube formation of
    endothelial cells,  suppressed phosphorylation of Akt, mTOR, and Stat3, and  enhanced
    phosphorylation of -catenin and markedly decreased tran-nuclear translocation
    of NF-B, -catenin, and TCF-1.', 'In vivo, administration of -solanine  in a xenograft
    mouse model induced decreases in tumor volume and weight by 61 and 43%, respectively,
    as well as MMP-2/9, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, and VEGF expression.',
  'These results indicate that the beneficial in vitro and in vivo effects seem to
    occur via the suppression of proliferation, angiogenesis, and metastasis.', It
    seems that solanine might be an effective compound for the treatment of human
    pancreatic cancer., An in vitro investigation of the effects of -solanine on human
    androgen-independent prostate cancer cell line PC-3 showed that -solanine suppressed
    the growth of the cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner and that the cells
    were arrested in S phase., 'The protein level of IB was increased and that of
    Bcl-2 was decreased at all tested concentrations, suggesting that the antiprostate
    cancer effect occurred via inhibition of cell proliferation, arrest of the cells
    in S phase, induction of apoptosis, upregulation of the expression of IB, and
    downregulation of Bcl-2.', Shen et al., investigated the mechanism involved in
    the suppression of human prostate cancer cell line  metastasis by -solanine.,
  The results show that -solanine reduces the viability of PC-3 cells., 'Treatment
    with a nontoxic dose markedly suppresses cell invasion and significantly elevates
    the expression of epithelial marker E-cadherin, and it concomitantly decreases
    the expression of mesenchymal marker vimentin, suggesting that the glycoalkaloid
    suppresses the epithelialmesenchymal transition.', 'The authors also showed that
    -solanine reduces the mRNA level of MMP-2, MMP-9, and extracellular inducer of
    matrix metalloproteinase, but it increases the expression of reversion-inducing
    cysteine-rich protein with kazal motifs  and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1  and
    TIMP-2.', 'In addition, it suppresses the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositide-3
    kinase, Akt, and ERK.', 'Furthermore, -solanine downregulates oncogenic microRNA-21,
    upregulates tumor suppressor miR-138 expression and reduces ERK and PI3K/Akt signaling
    pathways, and regulates expression of miR-21 and miR-138.', 'It seems that the
    inhibition of PC-3 cell invasion by -solanine might, in part, result from blocking
    EMT and the expression of MMPs.', These findings have therapeutic potential for
    suppressing invasion of prostate cancer cells., Mohsenikia et al., investigated
    -solanine toxicity in vitro and in vivo and assessed its protective and therapeutic
    effects on a typical mouse model of breast cancer., 'The results show that -solanine
    significantly suppressed the proliferation of mouse mammary carcinoma cells both
    in vitro and in vivo; at a concentration of 5 mg/kg, the tumor rate in the treated
    group was 0 compared with a 75% rate in the untreated controls.', The average
    tumor size and weight were significantly lower in treated mice than that in corresponding
    controls., 'Moreover, -solanine induced an increased in Bax protein expression
    in the breast tumor compared with that its respective control group and induced
    decreased expression of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 protein and a decrease in proliferative
    and angiogenic parameters.', These results demonstrate the chemoprotective and
    chemotherapeutic potential of -solanine in a breast cancer model that operates
    through apoptosis induction and cell proliferation and angiogenesis inhibition.,
  Lu et al., examined the effect of -solanine on the metastasis of melanoma cancer
    cells in vitro., 'The results show that -solanine  inhibited proliferation of
    human melanoma cell line A2058 in a dose-dependent manner,  markedly suppressed
    cell migration and invasion and reduced the activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9, involved
    in the migration and invasion of cancer cells, at a nontoxic dose,  potently suppressed
    the phosphorylation of JNK, PI3K, and Akt but did not affect phosphorylation of
    extracellular signal regulating kinase, and  significantly decreased the nuclear
    level of NF-B and inhibited NF-B activity.', 'Collectively, the results suggest
    that -solanine inhibited migration and invasion of A2058 cells by reducing MMP-2/9
    activities and inhibiting JNK and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways and NF-B activity.',
  Hep G2 cells treated with -solanine showed typical signs of apoptosis associated
    with a lowered membrane potential of the mitochondria and an increased concentration
    of Ca2+., 'It seems that -solanine opens up channels in the membrane by lowering
    the membrane potential that then leads to the transport of Ca2+ ions down their
    concentration gradient, resulting in an increase in the concentration of calcium
    ions in the cell and initiating the mechanism apoptosis.', 'Here, we will mention
    several aspects of solanidine biology and chemistry that may be relevant to the
    theme of the present review.', 'A structurefunction relationship study of the
    biological activities  on human osteosarcoma 1547 cells revealed a correlation
    between the experimental and theoretical data that highlighted the importance
    of the heterosugar moiety and the 5,6 double bond in these activities.', 'Six
    synthetic solanidine analogues exhibited strong anticancer activities and multidrug
    resistance reversal effects in a hypodiploid population of HeLa murine lymphoma
    cells, suggesting that the modified solanidine skeleton is a suitable substrate
    for the design and synthesis of further innovative drug candidates with anticancer
    activities.', 'Because intrinsic or acquired resistance of tumor cells to multiple
    cytotoxic drugs  is a major cause of failure of cancer chemotherapy, Lavie et
    al.', 'examined the ability of steroidal alkaloids of plant origin, namely, the
    Veratrum sp.', alkaloid cyclopamine and the Lycopersicon sp., 'Aglycone  tomatidine,
    to act as chemosensitizers in multidrug-resistant NCI AdrR human adenocarcinoma.',
  'The results show that the alkaloids inhibited P-gp-mediated drug transport and
    multidrug resistance, suggesting that these plant-derived compounds may serve
    as chemosensitizers in combination chemotherapy with conventional cytotoxic drugs
    for treating multidrug-resistant cancer.', 'Here, we will briefly mention results
    of reported studies on the anticarcinogenic potential of -tomatine in vitro and
    in vivo.', 'Lee et al., using the MTT in vitro assay, found that commercial tomatine
    is a strong inhibitor of growth for both human colon and liver cancer cell lines,
    as evidenced by the dose-dependent  inhibition of HT29 colon cancer cells at levels
    ranging from 38.0 to 81.5% and of human Hep G2 liver cancer cells from 46.3 to
    89.2%.', The anticarcinogenic activity against human liver cancer cells at a tomatine
    concentration of 1 g/mL was higher than the activity observed with the commercial
    anticancer drug doxorubicin., Friedman et al., also investigated six green and
    three red tomatoes extracts for their ability to induce cell death in human cancer
    and normal cells using a microculture MTT assay., 'Compared to the untreated controls,
    the high-tomatine green tomato extracts strongly inhibited the following human
    cancer cell lines: breast, colon, gastric, and hepatoma   as well as normal human
    liver cells.', 'In another study, we discovered that the activity of -tomatine
    generally decreases upon removal of one or more of the four carbohydrate groups
    of the lycotetraose side chain.', 'For example, the activity of -tomatine against
    the PC-3 prostate cancer cells was about 200 times greater than that of the aglycone
    tomatidine.', 'Tomatidine is, however, active against the foodborne pathogen Staphylococcus
    aureus, suggesting that the two bioactivities seem to be governed by different
    mechanisms.', Our systematic studies on the bioactivity of tomatine at microgram
    levels against multiple human cancer cells seems to have stimulated interest from
    a number of investigators mentioned below to explore the biomarkers and associated
    signaling pathways that may be associated with the anticarcinogenic effects of
    tomatine., -Tomatine inhibited human leukemia MOLT-4 cells by activating cell
    cycle checkpoints without damaging single or double DNA strands in the cells.,
  The slowing of the cell cycle seems to involve caspase-independent cell death associated
    with an increase in the tumor suppressor protein p53 and the proapoptotic protein
    PUMA  as well as other biomarkers associated with cell cycle regulation., A related
    study found that -tomatine-mediated anticancer activity against human chronic
    myeloid leukemia cells in vitro and in a transplanted mouse tumor operated through
    cell cycle- and caspase-independent pathways., '-Tomatine inhibited PC-3 prostate
    cancer cells with an IC50 value of 1.67 M. Cytotoxicity occurred after an hour
    of treatment and was mainly due to induction of apoptosis, as evidenced by decreased
    mitochondrial membrane potential, increased nuclear condensation, polarization
    of F-actin potential, cell membrane permeability, cytochrome c expression, induction
    of activation of caspase-3, -8, and -9, inhibition of NF-B nuclear translocation,
    and a decrease in NF-B/p50 and NF-Bp65 in the nuclear fraction.', 'Suppression
    of NF-B activation by -tomatine in PC-3 prostate cancer cells seems to occur through
    the inhibition of IB kinase activity, leading to sequential suppression of IB
    phosphorylation, IB degradation, NF-B/p65 phosphorylation, and NF-B p50/p65 nuclear
    translocation.', 'As expected, -tomatine also reduced TNF--induced activation
    of the prosurvival mediator Akt.', Its inhibition of NF-B activation was accompanied
    by significant reduction in the expression of NF-B-dependent antiapoptotic  proteins.,
  It seems that NF-B plays a role in prostate cancer and that agents that suppress
    its activation may inhibit development or progression of this malignancy., Shih
    et al., 'found that -tomatine  inhibited cell invasion, migration, and phosphorylation
    of Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2  in human lung adenocarcinoma
    A549 cells,  did not affect phosphorylation of JNK and p38,  decreased nuclear
    levels of NF-B, c-Fos, and c-Jun, and  inhibited the binding abilities of NF-B
    and activator protein-1.', 'Metastasis inhibition occurs by reducing the effects
    of MMP-2, MMP-9, and uPA  through the PI3K/Akt or ERK1/2 signaling pathway and
    inhibiting NF-B or AP-1 binding activities.', A related study confirmed that -tomatine
    suppressed invasion and migration of human non-small-cell lung cancer NCI-H460
    cells through inactivation of the FAK/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and lowering
    the binding activity of NF-B., 'Cytotoxicity occurred through inactivation of
    the signaling pathway and enhancement of IkB protein expression to reduce NF-B
    DNA binding activity, resulting in the downregulation of MMP-7 expression, inhibition
    of cell migration, and interference with the rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton
    by decreasing the expression of the pFAK protein.', 'Feeding 2000 ppm of tomatine
    and 224 ppm of the multiorgan carcinogen dibenzopyrene  to rainbow trout for 9
    months resulted in a reduced incidence of liver and stomach tumors by 41.3 and
    36.3%, respectively, as compared to the incidence of tumors observed with DBP
    alone.', This seems to be the first report on the inhibition of tumor growth by
    dietary -tomatine., Intraperitoneally  administered -tomatine  significantly attenuated
    the growth of androgen-independent PC-3 prostate cancer cells in mice., Tumor
    suppression was associated with increased apoptosis and with reduced nuclear translocation
    of the p50 and p65 components of the NF-B signaling pathway., It seems that -tomatine
    can inhibit the growth of prostate cancer tumors in vivo without inducing overt
    toxicity., An evaluation of the antitumor activity of -tomatine against PC-3 cell
    tumors grown subcutaneously and orthotopically in mice showed that ip administration
    of -tomatine significantly attenuates the growth of PC-3 cell tumors grown at
    both sites., Analysis of tumor material indicates that the tumor-suppressing effects
    were accompanied by increased apoptosis and lower proliferation of tumor cells
    as well as reduced nuclear translocation of the p50 and p65 components of NF-B.,
  Intraperitoneal-injected -tomatine at 1 mg/kg slowed the growth of mammary carcinoma  in
    mice., The combination of -tomatine  and the cancer drug doxorubicin  acted synergistically
    and extended survival of the mice with the Ehrlich tumors., 'The activity against
    the tumors, which are derived from adenocarcinoma of the mammary gland, seems
    to involve the immune system in the inhibition of tumor progression.', This suggestion
    seems plausible based on reports by other investigators that tomatine contributes
    to the protective immunity of rodents., Kim et al., determined the effect of commercial
    -tomatine on CT-26 colon cancer cells in vitro and in vivo in an intracutaneously
    transplanted mouse tumor., Cytotoxicity experiments showed that -tomatine induces
    about 50% lysis of the cancer cells at 3.5 M after 24 h treatment., 'Large proportions
    of cells were found to be in the Annexin V /propidium iodide  phase of cell death,
    implying late-phase apoptotic/necrotic status.', -Tomatine induced cell death
    in CT-26 cancer cells through caspase-independent signaling pathways., 'This conclusion
    was supported by western blot analysis showing localization of apoptosis-inducing
    mitochondrial protein  in the nucleus, downregulation of the apoptosis inhibitor
    survivin, and failure to detect the active form of caspase-3, -8, and -9 produced
    by proteolytic cleavage in CT-26 cancer cells.', The ip-administered -tomatine  also
    markedly inhibited growth of the tumor without causing body and organ weight changes.,
  It seems that the reduced tumor growth in the mice by 38% after 2 weeks was the
    result of increased caspase-independent apoptosis associated with increased nuclear
    translocation of AIF and decreased survivin expression in tumor tissues., It seems
    that -tomatine in pure form and in tomatine-rich green tomatoes might prevent
    colon cancer., 'In addition to the cited mechanistic aspects involving proapoptotic
    biomarkers and signaling pathways, it seems likely that tomatinecholesterol interactions,
    tomatine-induced stimulation of the immune system, and disruption of cancer cell
    membranes might also contribute to the mechanisms that govern its anticarcinogenicity.',
  '-Tomatine can act as a powerful adjuvant to elicit an antigen-specific cell-mediated
    immune response to the circumsporozoite  protein, a major pre-erythrocyte stage
    malaria vaccine candidate antigen, requiring both CD80 and CD86 costimulation
    to form antigen-specific cellular immunity.', Heal et al., found that -tomatine
    contributed to protective immunity elicited by a malaria vaccine candidate via
    CD8+ T cell release of antigen-specific IFN- in a Plasmodium berghei  rodent model.,
  It seems that stimulation of the immune system might also contribute the anticarcinogenic
    effects of -tomatine., Sucha et al., observed that the inhibition of cell proliferation
    and viability of human breast adenocarcinoma MCF-7 cells in culture at concentrations
    of 6 and 9 M was followed by a recovery of cells., The recovery was not caused
    by the biotransformation of -tomatine in the cells but by a substantial decrease
    in the concentration of -tomatine in the culture medium due to its binding with
    cholesterol., 'Additional experiments on the regulation of the mechanism of action
    of -tomatine revealed a loss of ATP in -tomatine-treated cells but no DNA damage,
    no changes in the levels of the proteins p53 and p21, and no apoptosis.', The
    authors suggest that these results support the conclusion that -tomatine does
    not induce apoptosis in the MCF-7 cell line in culture., 'Another study found
    that treatment of human myeloid leukemia HL-60 cells with -tomatine resulted in
    growth inhibition and apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner, that both
    events were partially abrogated by added cholesterol, and that -tomatine inhibited
    the growth of HL-60 xenografts in vivo.', The authors suggest that interactions
    between -tomatine and cell membrane-associated cholesterol might be involved in
    mediating the in vivo anticarcinogenic effect of -tomatine., 'These results and
    the reported strong affinity of -tomatine to cholesterol in an artificial cell
    membrane, and to plasma cholesterol in vivo, imply that the affinity of the glycoalkaloid
    to cancer cell membrane cholesterol might be a factor governing the mechanism
    of apoptosis.', 'As part of an effort designed to establish the mechanism of action
    of glycoalkaloids in cells, frog embryos and frog skin were exposed to varying
    concentrations of -tomatine and tomatidine.', -Tomatine increased the fluorescence-measured
    membrane permeability of frog embryos by about 600% compared with control values;
    the corresponding value for tomatidine was about 150%., 'The glycoalkaloid also
    diminished sodium-active transport in frog skin by about 16% compared with control
    values, as estimated from the change in the interstitial short-circuit current.',
  Tomatidine had no effect on frog skin., These observations suggest that the sugar
    side chain present in -tomatine but not in tomatidine influences membrane permeability
    of cells., 'As these findings complement similar results with glycoalkaloids from
    potatoes and eggplants, it is likely that the disruption of cancer cell membranes
    associated with changes in ion flux and interstitial currents of the membranes
    may contribute to the anticarcinogenic mechanisms governing their action in animal
    and human cells in vitro and in vivo.', 'In a related study involving membrane
    potentials, Taveira et al.', 'found that tomatine-containing tomato leaf extracts
    and the isolated -tomatine and tomatidine pure compounds at nontoxic concentrations
    preserved the mitochondria membrane potential, decreased reactive oxygen species
    of SY5Y glutamate-insulted neuronal cells, and interacted with nicotinic receptors.',
  The authors suggest that this study provides novel insights into the neuroprotective
    effect of glutamate-induced neurotoxicity and demonstrates the low toxicity of
    both compounds., 'Overall, the cited studies seem to indicate that the molecular,
    signaling, biomarker, immunomodulating, cholesterol-chelating, and membrane-disruptive
    events at the cellular and molecular levels associated with apoptosis and cell
    migration and invasion might not be the same for the different cancer cell lines.',
  They imply that both intrinsic and extrinsic proapoptosis pathways are involved
    and that -tomatine may protect against the development and progression of several
    cancers., 'This is not surprising because, as mentioned earlier, carcinogenesis
    is a sequential multistage cellular process consisting of tumor initiation, promotion,
    and progression, characterized by dysregulation of multiple genes resulting in
    multiple adverse symptoms.', Each stage involves signaling pathways and both the
    same and different associated biomarkers., The structurally different glycoalkaloids
    and their aglycones might impact the cancer cell components at different rates.,
  Antineoplastic glycoalkaloids complement and extend our knowledge of the mechanisms
    of alterations in the gene and/or protein levels of the Bcl-2 family members and
    other cell death mechanisms that are active in cancer cells following treatment
    with glycoalkaloids and numerous other natural compounds., This overview is intended
    to stimulate interest in the use of both pure and food-containing glycoalkaloids
    at nontoxic levels to help protect against or ameliorate multiorgan carcinogenesis.,
  'With respect to potatoes, unofficial worldwide guidelines recommend a guideline
    for total glycoalkaloid content of 20 mg/100 g fresh weight.', 'On the basis of
    the anticarcinogenic results discussed earlier, it seems that this level in commercial
    potatoes might help to protect against multiple cancers.', 'Epidemiological studies
    are, however, needed to demonstrate this possibility.', Guidelines for maximum
    glycoalkaloid content of eggplants and tomatoes have not been established., 'Because,
    compared to the other glycoalkaloids, tomatine exhibits low toxicity in animals
    and humans, future experimental and epidemiological studies should concentrate
    on the tomato compounds.', Plant scientists are challenged to develop high-tomatine
    red tomatoes., 'High-tomatine red tomatoes will contain two anticarcinogenic compounds:
    the antioxidative red pigment lycopene and tomatine.', The potential payoff will
    be better human health., 'Future studies need to address the following additional
    food and medical aspects:


    Determine whether in vitro anticarcinogenic effects of pure glycoalkaloids and
    glycoalkaloid-containing plant foods can be duplicated in humans.', Determine
    how bioactivities vary depending on whether glycoalkaloids are tested or consumed
    in the free-state or as part of a mixture or a food., 'Determine, using epidemiology,
    the presumptive connection between glycoalkaloid consumption and lower risk of
    cancer in humans.', Determine whether glycoalkaloid metabolites formed after absorption
    into the circulation possess anticarcinogenic properties., 'Validate, via dietary
    interventions, predicted anticarcinogenic properties based on mathematical modeling
    or molecular interaction networks.', 'Define additive and synergistic effects
    of glycoalkaloids with other anticarcinogenic food-related plant foods and bioactive
    compounds, including pigmented rice brans and its anticarcinogenic constituent
    -oryzanol; black and green teas and their anticarcinogenic epigallocatechin gallate  and
    theaflavin constituents; mushroom polysaccharides; and multifunctional jujube
    fruit  and jujube fruit and seed compounds jujuboside B and betulinic acid.',
  'It seems that consumption of glycoalkaloid-containing food, pigmented rice, and
    teas with a high content of catechins and theaflavins might ameliorate carcinogensis
    and that tea flavonoids might alleviate both cancer and infectious disease; as
    noted above, lycopene- and tomatine-containing tomatoes might mitigate both carcinogenesis
    and cardiovascular disease.', 'Combinations of food and bioactive food ingredients
    that act additively or synergistically will decrease the amounts needed for effective,
    safe, and tasty food formulations.', 'Because inhibition of hedgehog signaling
    decreases tumor growth, determine whether inhibition of hedgehog signaling by
    tomatidine or tomatine can help to inhibit carcinogenesis.', 'Will -tomatine,
    which is reported to inhibit the herpes simplex virus via insertion into the viral
    envelope, also inhibit the human papillomavirus that causes cervical cancer?',
  Encourage growers to produce tomatoes with a high content of tomatine using antisense
    RNA methods to suppress the genes that degrade tomatine., Create tomatine-containing
    potatoes., 'Determine the anticarcinogenic potential of numerous glycoalkaloids
    present in tubers, leaves, and sprouts of uncultivated and wild-type potatoes.',
  'Do glycoalkaloids contribute to the anticarcinogenic properties of anthocyanin-rich
    color-fleshed and high-antioxidant potatoes?', I take great pleasure in thanking
    my collaborators whose names appear in the cited references and Carol E. Levin
    for facilitating the preparation of the manuscript.]
