text: [The role of fruit and vegetables in breast cancer  development has long been
    debated., 'A large variety of vegetables and fruit are consumed by Mediterranean
    populations, a favourable setting for evaluating the effects of these foods.',
  'The association between vegetables and fruit consumption, overall and by specific
    types, and BC risk was studied in the Italian section of the European Prospective
    Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition study.', 'Over 31,000 women, aged 36-64
    years, recruited in five Italian centers between 1993 and 1998, were available
    for analyses with dietary and lifestyle information and anthropometric measurements.',
  'After a median follow-up of 11.25 years, 1,072 invasive and in situ incident BC
    cases were identified.', Cox proportional hazard models  showed an inverse association
    between consumption of all vegetables and BC risk., 'According to subtypes of
    vegetables, an inverse association emerged for increasing consumption of leafy
    vegetables  and fruiting vegetables.', An inverse association also emerged with
    increasing consumption of raw tomatoes., 'In contrast, no association of fruit,
    overall or by subtypes, with BC risk was found.', 'In this Mediterranean population,
    a clear protective role of increasing vegetables consumption, mainly leafy and
    fruiting vegetables, on BC risk emerged.']
