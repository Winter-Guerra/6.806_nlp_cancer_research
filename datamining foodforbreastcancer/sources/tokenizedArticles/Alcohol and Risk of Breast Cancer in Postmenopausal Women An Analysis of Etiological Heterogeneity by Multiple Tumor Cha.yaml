text: [Alcohol consumption is an established risk factor for breast cancer., Whether
    associations vary by specific tumor characteristics independent of other characteristics
    is unclear., 'We evaluated the association between alcohol consumption and breast
    cancer risk in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial
    cohort.', Hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for subtypes defined by histological
    type and estrogen receptor /progesterone receptor  status were calculated with
    standard Cox models., A novel 2-stage Cox model assessed heterogeneity in risk
    for individual tumor characteristics while adjusting for others., 'Significant
    trends across categories of alcohol consumption were observed, with hazard ratios
    for those consuming 7 or more drinks per week versus never drinkers as follows:
    for estrogen receptorpositive  cancer, 1.48 : 1.19, 1.83); for progesterone receptorpositive  cancer,
    1.64 ; for ER+/PR+ cancer, 1.63 ; and for mixed ductal/lobular cancer, 2.51.',
  'For ER+ and PR+ cancers, trends were significant for ductal and mixed ductal/lobular
    types.', PR status explained the positive association with ER status., Alcohol
    consumption was not associated with all breast cancer subtypes., 'Future work
    should emphasize large collaborative studies, precise definition of subtypes,
    and adjustment for correlated tumor characteristics.']
