text: ['The aim of this research was to study the potential anti-inflammatory activity
    of myrtle, sarsaparilla, Arabian or French lavender, and calamint  along with
    their apoptotic effects on the pro-inflammatory cells, and the correlation of
    these effects with the plants potential anti-oxidant activity.', 'Myrtle extract
    exhibited the highest inhibitory activity in the paw oedema induced by carrageenan,
    whereas calamint, lavender, and sarsaparilla produced inhibitions of 49%, 38%,
    and 47%, respectively.', None of them had an effect on the TPA-induced ear oedema.,
  'Moreover, all the extracts except sarsaparilla showed different degrees of anti-oxidant
    activity.', 'Lavender and myrtle at 200 g/mL decreased cell viability by 63% and
    59%, respectively, after 3 h of incubation.', 'Neutrophil elimination through
    apoptosis could be implicated in the resolution of acute inflammation in the case
    of lavender, whereas the reduction of reactive oxygen species produced by neutrophils,
    such as the superoxide anion and the hydroxyl radical, could be implicated in
    the overall reduction of inflammation.', These results may support the traditional
    use of these plants.]
