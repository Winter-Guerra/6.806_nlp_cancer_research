text: [Consumption of a diet high in plant-based foods is associated with a decreased
    risk of epithelial cell cancers at several sites., 'Cytoprotectants in fruits
    and vegetables include vitamins, minerals and numerous micronutrients.', 'While
    there is little evidence uniquely linking berry consumption with lower cancer
    risk, berries contain high levels of compounds believed to reduce malignant transformation,
    including the polyphenol flavonoids and anthocyanins.', There is strong and convincing
    evidence that berry extracts and berry phytochemicals modulate biomarkers of DNA
    damage and indicators of malignant transformation in vitro and in vivo., Data
    from numerous cell culture and animal models indicate that berry components such
    as the anthocyanins are potent anticarcinogenic agents and are protective against
    genomic instability at several sites in the carcinogenic pathway., 'Anticarcinogenic
    mechanisms include modulation of carcinogen activation and detoxification, decreased
    DNA binding of the carcinogen, inhibition of oxidative DNA damage, alteration
    in cell signalling and malignant transformation and inhibition of cell invasiveness
    and metastasis.', Exactly which berry constituents are cytoprotective remains
    uncertain and in the majority of in vitro and in vivo studies the concentration
    of extract or phytochemical employed is non-nutritional., Evidence for an anticarcinogenic
    effect in human studies is weak.]
