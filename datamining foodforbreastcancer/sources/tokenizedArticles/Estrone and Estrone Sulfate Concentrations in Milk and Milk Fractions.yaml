text: ['Dairy products naturally contain estrogens, and some consumer groups contend
    these estrogens cause adverse health effects.', 'The objectives of this research
    were to characterize estrone  and estrone sulfate  concentrations in milk from
    a large number of individual cows, in skim and fat fractions of milk, and in retail
    milk to provide food and nutrition practitioners with information to estimate
    potential consumption.', Milk was from Holstein cows., Data are presented as means
    and standard deviations., Analysis of variance was used to determine differences
    in E1 and E1S content of whole milk and its skim and fat fractions., 'Mean E1
    and E1S concentrations  were 7.012.7 and 46.762.1 pg/mL, respectively.', Analysis
    of milk fractions  demonstrated that 55% of E1 and 14% of E1S were associated
    with the fat fraction with the remainder associated with the skim fraction., 'Concentrations
    of E1 and E1S in pasteurized-homogenized whole milk  averaged 10.30.6 and 85.97.3
    pg/mL, respectively.', 'Production rates of E1 plus estradiol in human beings
    range from 54,000 to 630,000 ng/day.', US Food and Drug administration guidelines
    state that no physiologic effects occur when consumption is 1% of the endogenous
    quantities produced by the segment of the population with the lowest daily production.,
  This threshold value for intake would be 540 ng/day., 'Estimated total E1 intake
    from three servings of whole milk was 68 ng/day, which represents 0.01% to 0.1%
    of daily production rates in human beings.', These findings support levels below
    the current guidelines for safe consumption.]
