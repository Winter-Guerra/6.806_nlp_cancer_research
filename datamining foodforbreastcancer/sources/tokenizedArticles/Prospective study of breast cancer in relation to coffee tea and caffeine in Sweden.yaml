text: [Studies of coffee and tea consumption and caffeine intake as risk factors for
    breast cancer are inconclusive., 'We assessed coffee and tea consumption, caffeine
    intake, and possible confounding factors among 42,099 women from the Swedish Womens
    Lifestyle and Health study, the participants of which were aged 30-49 years at
    enrollment in 1991-1992\.', Complete follow-up for breast cancer incidence was
    performed through 2012 via linkage to national registries., Poisson regression
    models were used to estimate relative risks  and 95% confidence intervals  for
    breast cancer., 'During follow-up 1,395 breast cancers were diagnosed.', 'The
    RR was 0.97  for a 1-unit increase in cups of coffee/day, 1.14  for a 1-unit increase
    in cups of tea/day, and 0.97  for a 100 mg/day increase in caffeine intake.',
  'Although the RR for no consumption, a group with a relatively small number of women,
    was not statistically significant, women with higher consumption had a decreased
    breast cancer risk  compared to women consuming 1-2 cups of coffee/day.', 'Compared
    to no consumption, women consuming &gt;1 cups tea/day showed an increased breast
    cancer risk.', 'Similar patterns of estimates were observed for breast cancer
    risk overall, during pre- and postmenopausal years, and for ER+ or PR+ breast
    cancer, but not for ER and PR breast cancer.', 'Our findings suggest that coffee
    consumption and caffeine intake is negatively associated with the risk of overall
    and ER+/PR breast cancer, and tea consumption is positively associated with the
    risk of overall and ER+/PR+ breast cancer.', 'After water, coffee and tea are
    the most commonly consumed beverages in the world.', Coffee consumption is especially
    high in Northern Europe and North America., 'Black tea consumption is predominant
    in Northern Europe, North America, and Western Asia, while green tea consumption
    is more popular in Eastern Asia.', 'Moreover, a great variety of herbal infusions,
    such as mate, a traditional hot drink in parts of South America, also contain
    caffeine, a chemical substance present in coffee and tea.', 'Hence, any causal
    association between the consumption of these beverages and breast cancer could
    have major public health implications.', 'There are several plausible mechanisms
    by which coffee, tea, and caffeine may affect breast cancer risk.', 'Coffee and
    tea contain a wide variety of phytochemicals, many of which are antioxidants,
    and coffee compounds such as caffeine, chlorogenic acid, kahweol, and cafestol
    have known biologic effects.', 'Coffee may inhibit DNA methylation, influence
    tumor differentiation, and alter sex hormone levels.', 'Theaflavins and thearubigins,
    the oxidized derivatives of black tea catechins, may enhance apoptosis, suppress
    cell proliferation, and inhibit angiogenesis, although black tea polyphenols have
    low or no bioavailability.', 'Caffeine is present in both coffee and tea, and
    has been positively correlated with sex hormone binding globulin levels, a direct
    determinant of bioavailable estradiol among both pre- and postmenopausal women.',
  'Although a number of epidemiologic studies have analyzed coffee and/or tea consumption
    and the risk of breast cancer, so far the results have been inconclusive.', 'Some
    studies showed an inverse association, particularly for subgroups of estrogen
    receptor -negative cancers, BRCA1 mutation carriers and postmenopausal women,
    while most cohort studies found no association between the risk of breast cancer
    overall and coffee consumption, tea consumption or caffeine intake.', 'We investigated
    whether coffee consumption, tea consumption, and caffeine intake is associated
    with breast cancer overall, by menopausal status, or ER and progesterone receptor  status,
    in the Swedish Womens Lifestyle and Health  study.', The Swedish WLH study cohort
    and exposure assessments have been previously described in detail., 'Briefly,
    the source population of this study was women aged 30-49 years residing in the
    Uppsala Health Care Region in Sweden between 1991 and 1992.', 'A random sample
    of the source population was asked to complete a postal questionnaire, which contained
    a food frequency questionnaire ; 49,259 women returned the questionnaire and were
    enrolled in the study.', 'We excluded 7,160  women: 2,981 with any cancer before
    cohort enrollment; 934 with energy intakes outside the 1st  and 99th  percentiles;
    41 who had emigrated; and 3,204 with missing values on exposure variables.', 'Thus
    42,099 women were included in the present analyses.', 'The Swedish Data Inspection
    Board, the Regional Ethical Committee of Uppsala University, and the Ethical Committee
    of the Karolinska Institutet approved the study.', Consent was assumed by the
    return of the postal questionnaire., Coffee consumption during the preceding year
    was assessed in an open-ended question asking how many cups of coffee per day
    or per week women consumed on average., One cup of coffee was estimated to contain
    150 ml., Tea consumption during the preceding year was not assessed in cups per
    day., 'Instead, participants reported the frequency of their consumption using
    nine pre-specified frequencies, and the portion size, with one cup of tea estimated
    to contain 200 ml.', We then translated this information into cups per day., A
    previous validation study of a similar FFQ was conducted among Swedish women.,
  It showed the FFQ to be a valid instrument to measure coffee and tea consumption
    compared with four 7-day dietary records collected during different seasons.,
  'Moreover, it showed that the FFQ was reproducible at two separate administrations
    conducted at a 1-year interval.', Caffeine intake  was calculated based on the
    sum of the estimated amounts of caffeine in the coffee and tea consumed., 'The
    present analyses considered set values of 69 mg of caffeine per 100 ml of coffee
    and 25 mg of caffeine per 100 ml of tea based on a research report published by
    the Nordic Council of Ministers, which comprehensively reviewed studies on caffeine,
    caffeine intake, and health results.', 'In the report, the mean value of caffeine
    content was 103 mg in a 150 ml cup of filtered coffee and 38 mg in a 150 ml cup
    of tea.', 'We collected no information on other caffeine-containing foods, beverages,
    or drugs.', 'The cohort was followed from 1992 until 31 December 2012 through
    linkage with the Swedish Cancer Registry, Mortality Registry, and Population Registry.',
  'Follow-up time was calculated from the date of entry into the Swedish WLH study
    until the occurrence of breast cancer, death, or the end of the observation period,
    whichever came first.', Our outcome was defined as a diagnosis of invasive breast
    cancer., 'Information on hormone receptor status was extracted from the Uppsala
    Regional Cancer Registry, which covers the source population.', 'During follow-up,
    158 participants had a diagnosis of breast cancer in the Swedish Cancer Registry
    that was not recorded in the Uppsala Regional Cancer Registry, as the participant
    no longer lived in the region at the time of breast cancer diagnosis.', ER and
    PR status was evaluated by Abbott immunoassay until 1997 and by an immunohistochemical
    method thereafter., Cases with 0.1 fmol/g cytosol DNA by Abbott immunoassay were
    considered hormone receptor-positive., 'By the immunohistochemical method, cases
    were considered hormone receptor-positive when the percentage of positive cells
    was 10%, and hormone receptor-negative when the percentage of positive cells was
    ;10%.', Age at menopause was obtained by combining information from the baseline
    questionnaire and a follow-up questionnaire conducted in 2002-2003., 'Women without
    information on age at menopause were considered postmenopausal at age 53, which
    corresponds to the 75th percentile of age at menopause in the study sample.',
  'Using Poisson regression, we estimated relative risks  and two-sided 95% Wald confidence
    intervals  of breast cancer according to different exposures.', We fitted regression
    models by splitting the follow-up time  into 1-year intervals., 'Poisson regression
    gives approximately the same parameter estimates and likelihood ratios as Cox
    proportional hazards regression when the length of follow-up is split into finer
    intervals, but allows for greater flexibility in the modeling.', 'The three primary
    exposures, coffee consumption, tea consumption, and caffeine intake, were evaluated
    separately and were considered both continuously  and categorically.', 'Associations
    between breast cancer incidence and coffee consumption, tea consumption, and caffeine
    intake were examined considering all participants, as well as premenopausal and
    postmenopausal years separately.', We also examined associations stratified by
    hormone receptor status., 'When estimating the RRs of coffee and tea consumption,
    and caffeine intake, we adjusted for the following confounding factors: age, body
    mass index, duration of breastfeeding, and alcohol consumption.', These confounding
    factors were selected a priori due to their effect on the risk of breast cancer
    and their potential association with coffee consumption and tea consumption.,
  We fitted models both with and without adjustment for the confounding factors.,
  'In a sensitivity analysis we fitted a model that also adjusted for smoking status,
    education, and physical activity.', The effect of age on breast cancer was modeled
    with a cubic spline function., The SAS software  version 9.4 was used for the
    statistical analyses., 'During the 856,529 person-years of follow-up, 1,395 breast
    cancer cases  were diagnosed.', 'Table 1 shows coffee consumption, tea consumption,
    and caffeine intake according to the general characteristics of the study sample.',
  'More than two-thirds  of study women drank 3 or more cups of coffee/day, while
    most women  drank 1 cup of tea/day.', 'The more coffee women consumed, the higher
    their caffeine intake.', 'However, the more tea women drank, the lower their coffee
    consumption, which thereby lowered their caffeine intake.', 'General study characteristics
    were similar among women with different levels of coffee consumption, tea consumption,
    and caffeine intake.', 'Of all caffeine intake, 7% came from tea consumption,
    and 93% from coffee consumption.', 'Table 2 shows the RRs of breast cancer according
    to daily coffee consumption and tea consumption based on number of cups, and caffeine
    intake as a continuous variable.', 'The multivariable RRs for a 1-unit increase
    in cups of coffee/day were 0.97, 1.14  for cups of tea/day, and 0.97  for a 100
    mg increase in caffeine intake.', 'Similar estimates were observed during postmenopausal
    years, but risk estimates were not statistically significant during premenopausal
    years.', 'An increased RR of ER+/PR+ breast cancer was observed for a 1-unit increase
    in cups of tea/day, whereas decreased RRs of ER+/PR breast cancer were observed
    for a 1-unit increase in cups of coffee/day  and for a 100 mg increase in caffeine
    intake.', 'The estimated RRs remained unchanged in models that also adjusted for
    smoking status, education, and physical activity.', 'Table 3 shows the RRs of
    breast cancer according to daily coffee consumption, tea consumption, and caffeine
    intake overall and by menopausal status.', 'When considering statistical power,
    coffee consumption of 1-2 cups/day, instead of no consumption, was used as a reference
    category.', 'Compared to women consuming 1-2 cups of coffee per day, women who
    consumed 3 cups of coffee/day had a decreased risk of breast cancer, but this
    was not observed for no consumption.', 'Compared to no consumption, an increased
    risk of breast cancer with tea consumption was observed for &gt;1 cup of tea/day.',
  The RR for the 3rd tertile relative to the 1st tertile of caffeine intake was 0.86.,
  A decreased RR for high coffee consumption and an increased RR for tea consumption
    were observed during postmenopausal years but not premenopausal years., 'Table
    4 shows the RR of breast cancer according to coffee consumption, tea consumption,
    and caffeine intake by hormone receptor status.', A decreased risk of ER+/PR breast
    cancer was observed among women who consumed 3 cups of coffee/day., 'Compared
    with no consumption, increased risks of ER+/PR+ breast cancer were observed with
    tea consumption.', A decreased risk of ER+/PR breast cancer was observed with
    high caffeine intake., 'In this large prospective study with a broad variation
    in coffee consumption, we found a statistically significant decreasing trend of
    breast cancer overall with increasing coffee consumption and caffeine intake.',
  We also found a positive association between tea consumption and breast cancer overall.,
  Our findings were quantitatively similar in pre- and postmenopausal years., The
    mechanisms responsible for the chemopreventive effects of coffee are not fully
    understood., 'Known coffee constituents include caffeine, diterpenes, phenolic
    acids, melanoidins, N-methylpyridinium, and acrylamide, which are produced during
    the roasting of coffee beans.', 'The major polyphenols in coffee are chlorogenic
    acids and metabolites, including quinic acid, caffeic acid, ferulic acid, and
    coumaric acid.', Coffee could reduce reactive oxygen species by a direct antioxidant
    effect., 'Potential mechanisms for a chemopreventive effect of coffee involve
    the regulation of DNA repair genes and genes involved in the detoxification processes,
    as well as the processes of inflammation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and metastasis.',
  'Coffee consumption has been inversely associated with circulating markers of inflammation
    and insulin resistance, both of which may play a role in breast cancer.', 'In
    vitro studies found that coffee reduced the phase II enzyme, estrogen sulfotransferases  gene
    expression in Caco-2 cells.', 'Because sulfation is the major pathway involved
    in the inactivation of estrogens, the effect on SULT1E1 may enhance estrogen activity
    and thereby explain why the inverse association between coffee and cancer risk
    is more evident among subgroups of postmenopausal women for some cancers.', 'A
    number of epidemiologic studies have estimated the association between coffee
    consumption and the risk of breast cancer, but the results were inconclusive.',
  Several case-control studies suggested an inverse association between heavy coffee
    consumption  and ER- breast cancer among postmenopausal women or premenopausal
    women., 'However, most cohort studies found no association between the risk of
    breast cancer and coffee consumption, nor in subgroups of hormone receptor-positive
    and -negative breast cancers, pre- and postmenopausal women, or women drinking
    caffeinated versus decaffeinated coffee.', 'A cohort study in Sweden showed a
    reduced risk of breast cancer with boiled coffee consumption, a brewing method
    now limited primarily to rural areas of northern Sweden, but not with filtered
    coffee consumption, which is the most popular type of coffee in Sweden.', 'Brewing
    method has little effect on the caffeine and polyphenol levels in coffee, but
    is a major determinant of the diterpene level: diterpene concentration is high
    in boiled coffee and very low in filtered coffee.', 'Coffee contains two specific
    diterpenes, cafestol and kahweol, which produce biologic-effects compatible with
    anticarcinogenic properties, including the induction of phase II enzymes involved
    in carcinogen detoxification, specific inhibition of the phase I enzyme activity
    responsible for carcinogen activation, and stimulation of intracellular antioxidant
    defense mechanisms.', 'Kahweol is an antitumor compound with inhibitory effects
    on tumor cell growth and survival, especially against MDA-MB231 breast cancer
    cells.', 'In two meta-analyses, a weak or borderline inverse association was observed
    between coffee consumption and the risk of breast cancer overall.', 'Two other
    meta-analyses showed no association between the risk of breast cancer overall
    and coffee consumption, but showed statistically significant inverse associations
    for postmenopausal women, for BRCA1 mutation carriers, and for ER breast cancer.',
  'Tea extracts, especially those of green tea, and tea polyphenols have been shown
    to inhibit the formation and development of tumors in different organs in animal
    models.', 'There is considerable evidence that tea polyphenols, in particular
    -epigallocatechin-3-gallate, inhibit enzyme activities and signal transduction
    pathways, resulting in the suppression of cell proliferation and the enhancement
    of apoptosis, as well as the inhibition of cell invasion, angiogenesis, and metastasis.',
  'Cancer risk reduction is observed more frequently in studies on green tea than
    in those on black tea, which is probably because many polyphenols in black tea
    are poorly bioavailable, or not bioavailable due to fermentation.', 'As a chemical,
    EGCG can exert its actions in the form of an antioxidant or a pro-oxidant.', It
    can also bind to target molecules and trigger cascades of signalling or metabolic
    pathways that lead to the inhibition of carcinogenesis., 'The antioxidative activity
    of tea polyphenols could decrease oxidative DNA damage, which has been shown in
    both human and animal models.', 'Laboratory studies have presented strong evidence
    for cancer-preventive properties in tea constituents, but results from epidemiologic
    studies are inconclusive.', 'Only one cohort study in Sweden found an association
    between tea consumption and increased risk of breast cancer overall  and in ER+/PR+
    tumors, which is similar to the result in the present study, while the other case-control
    and cohort studies found no association.', 'The two most updated meta-analyses,
    which included up to 25 studies on black tea consumption, showed no association
    between black tea consumption and breast cancer overall or in subgroups by study
    design, geographic- region-, menopausal status, hormone receptor status, or BMI,
    while two other meta-analyses showed a modest increase in the risk of breast cancer
    with black tea consumption.', 'Caffeine, a natural purine alkaloid, is one of
    the main constituents of coffee and tea.', The mechanisms by which caffeine may
    affect breast carcinogenesis are complex and remain unclear., Caffeine has been
    reported to suppress cell cycle and proliferation and to induce apoptosis., 'Caffeine
    has also been positively associated with blood levels of estrone and sex hormone-binding
    globulin, but negatively associated with plasma-free estradiol.', 'In a prospective
    cohort in the United States, which assessed caffeine intake from coffee, tea,
    cola, and chocolate, caffeine intake was positively associated with the risk of
    ER/PR breast cancer  and breast tumors &gt;2 cm, whereas no significant association
    was reported between caffeine intake and ER+/PR+ or ER+/PR breast cancer.', 'In
    another cohort study in the United States, which assessed caffeine intake from
    caffeine-containing beverages and chocolate, an inverse association of caffeine
    intake with breast cancer was observed among postmenopausal women.', 'On the other
    hand, other cohort studies in Sweden, France, and the United States found no association
    between caffeine and breast cancer according to hormone receptor status or BMI.',
  'The strengths of our study include the population-based prospective design of the
    Swedish WLH study, and the complete follow-up with regard to breast cancer incidence.',
  'We also assessed coffee and tea consumption in great detail and had an unusually
    informative, wide range of exposures to coffee.', 'While most other studies analyzed
    postmenopausal women, we were able to address the topic in a large population
    of premenopausal women.', But our study also has limitations., 'The women in our
    cohort were aged 30-49 years at enrollment in 1991-1992, thus their responses
    in the questionnaire reflect mainly coffee consumption, tea consumption, and caffeine
    intake at premenopausal ages.', 'Moreover, coffee consumption and tea consumption
    were only assessed at enrollment.', This may attenuate our associations if women
    changed their coffee and tea habits during follow-up., 'Cumulative coffee/tea
    consumption was not measurable as duration before enrollment, and was not assessed
    during follow-up.', 'However, coffee and tea drinking habits in the Swedish population
    are often established in young adulthood and remain similar at least between 30
    and 60 years of age.', 'Based on an analysis of Swedish participants with repeated
    health surveys 10 years apart, coffee drinking habits tend to remain stable over
    a long period of time.', 'Misclassification of coffee and tea consumption due
    to measurement error associated with the FFQ certainly occurred in our study,
    but given the prospective study design this misclassification was likely non-differential.',
  'Measurement error with FFQs is likely to be greater than that with other methods,
    such as 24-hr recalls and diet diaries, and false-negative results have been suggested
    in studies of diet-disease associations.', 'Even though the substantial limitations
    of FFQs have been known for some time, they remain a standard tool for dietary
    assessment in large studies, as they are relatively simple and inexpensive compared
    to other instruments; investigators who conduct large-scale epidemiological studies
    find such questionnaires particularly attractive.', 'A validation study among
    Swedish women showed that their FFQ, which was similar to that used in the present
    study, was a valid instrument to measure coffee and tea consumption  when it was
    compared with four 7-day dietary records collected during different seasons.',
  'They also found that results were reproducible  between FFQ1 and FFQ2, which were
    conducted at a 1-year interval.', Studies on reproducibility and validity have
    concluded that coffee and tea are among the more accurately reported foods in
    FFQs., 'Total caffeine intake may differ considerably among individuals depending
    on their source of caffeine, caffeine concentration in these sources, and, for
    coffee and tea, brewing time and brewing method.', 'Caffeine-containing drugs,
    foods, and beverages other than coffee and tea were not included in total caffeine
    intake in this study, and thus the mean caffeine intake might be underestimated.',
  'Misclassification of menopausal status due to imputation for women without information
    on age at menopause may also have occurred in our study, but this misclassification
    was likely also non-differential and was of limited concern because we found no
    evidence of heterogeneity by menopausal status.', 'Lastly, our study included
    many statistical tests, each on the 5% level, and therefore a few statistically
    significant findings can be expected by chance alone.', 'In conclusion, our findings
    suggest that coffee consumption and caffeine intake is negatively associated with
    the risk of breast cancer overall and ER+/PR breast cancer, respectively, and
    tea consumption may be positively associated with risk of breast cancer overall
    and ER+/PR+ breast cancer.', Our findings provide additional evidence to support
    the role of coffee in cancer prevention., More detailed mechanism studies are
    needed to verify the effects of coffee/tea/caffeine in breast cancer., The roles
    and mechanisms of coffee/tea/caffeine in breast cancers with different hormone
    receptor statuses need to be examined in future studies., 'The authors thank Mrs
