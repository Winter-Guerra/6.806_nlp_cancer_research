text: [Cancer metastasis is the main cause leading to disease recurrence and high
    mortality in cancer patients., 'Therefore, inhibiting metastasis process or killing
    metastatic cancer cells by inducing apoptosis is of clinical importance in improving
    cancer patient survival.', 'Previous studies revealed that fucoidan, a fucose-rich
    polysaccharide isolated from marine brown alga, is a promising natural product
    with significant anti-cancer activity.', 'However, little is known about the role
    of endoplasmic reticulum  stress in fucoidan-induced cell apoptosis.', We reported
    that fucoidan treatment inhibits cell growth and induces apoptosis in cancer cells.,
  'Fucoidan treatments resulted in down-regulation of the glucose regulated protein
    78  in the metastatic MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, and of the ER protein 29  in
    the metastatic HCT116 colon cancer cells.', 'However, fucoidan treatment promoted
    ER Ca2+-dependent calmodulin-dependent kinase II  phosphorylation, Bcl-associated
    X protein  and caspase 12 expression in MDA-MB-231 cells, but not in HCT116 cells.',
  'In both types of cancer cells, fucoidan activated the phosphorylation of eukaryotic
    initiation factor 2 alpha \CCAAT/enhancer binding protein homologous protein  pro-apoptotic
    cascade and inhibited the phosphorylation of inositol-requiring kinase 1 \X-box
    binding proteins 1 splicing  pro-survival cascade.', 'Furthermore, CHOP knockdown
    prevented DNA damage and cell death induced by fucoidan.', Fucoidan exerts its
    anti-tumor function by modulating ER stress cascades., Contribution of ER stress
    to the fucoidan-induced cell apoptosis augments our understanding of the molecular
    mechanisms underlying its anti-tumour activity and provides evidence for the therapeutic
    application of fucoidan in cancer., 'Citation: Chen S, Zhao Y, Zhang Y, Zhang

    with high mortality due to its high metastatic ability and resistance to chemo-
    and radio-therapy., 'Despite the sophisticates of therapeutic strategy for cancer
    treatment, no treatment is 100% effective against disseminated/metastatic cancer.',
  'Until recently, most of the therapeutic drugs target on the proliferative cancer
    cells for the treatment of primary tumours.', 'Given that most cancer deaths are
    the result of metastatic disease, understanding the mechanisms of cancer metastasis
    and developing drugs for metastatic cancer are indeed emerging areas in cancer
    cell biology and cancer therapy.', Developing natural products for cancer therapy
    is a promising strategy for cancer treatment and prevention., 'For instance, fucoidan,
    a fucose-rich polysaccharide, is isolated from brown seaweed such Cladosiphon
    okamuranus and Fucus evanescens,.', 'Fucoidan is structurally similar to heparin,
    with a substantial percentage of L-fucose,.', 'Recent studies have demonstrated
    its various biological activities including anti-inflammatory, anti-coagulant,
    anti-HIV and anti-cancer  activities.', 'Significantly, fucoidan shows a high
    efficiency in the treatment of a variety of cancers, including breast cancer,
    prostate cancer, lung cancer, hepatoma and leukemia,, .', Its anti-tumour activity
    is exerted by regulating multiple signalling pathways in cancer cells., 'It was
    found that fucoidan can induce cell apoptosis via the activation of caspase-cascades,
    extracellular signal-regulated kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase  and the
    inactivation of p38MAPK and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase /protein kinase B,,.',
  'In addition, fucoidan also inhibits Wnt/-catenin pathway to decrease cyclin D1
    expression, leading to cell cycle arrest in vitro and in vivo,.', The in vivo
    studies demonstrated that fucoidan suppressed tumour growth and significantly
    diminished lung metastasis of 4T1 breast cancer cells ., 'Collectively, these
    results support the potential development of fucoidan as an anticancer drug.',
  'Albeit this, the mechanisms of action that fucoidan exerts on cancer cell apoptosis
    have not been fully understood.', 'In particular, little is known about the involvement
    of endoplasmic reticulum  stress, a central signalling that defines cells fate,
    in the fucoidan-mediated anti-tumour activity.', ER plays a crucial role in Ca2+
    homeostasis and cell pathophysiology., Accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins
    within the ER or Ca2+ store depletion induces ER stress and triggers the unfolded
    protein response to maintain ER homeostasis., 'Under resting conditions, the ER
    chaperone protein, the glucose regulated protein 78, seals the pore of the translocon
    in the ER and thus, reduces ER Ca2+ leak.', 'Under ER stress, GRP78 is released
    from the translocon and triggers ER Ca2+ depletion.', 'Cytosolic Ca2+ binds to
    calmodulin to activate Ca2+\calmodulin-dependent kinase II  signalling, leading
    to ER stress-induced cell apoptosis through activating the mitochondrial apoptosis
    pathway.', 'ER stress also leads to dissociation of GRP78 from the complexes formed
    with the luminal part of ER membrane proteins, protein kinase RNA -like ER kinase,
    inositol-requiring kinase 1  and activating transcription factor 6, resulting
    in autophosphorylation of PERK and IRE-1 and translocation of ATF6 to the Golgi
    for cleavage.', These alterations cause activation of their downstream signalling
    pathways., 'For instance, the activated PERK phosphorylates eukaryotic initiation
    factor 2 alpha  to attenuate protein translation and reduce ER protein overload.',
  'Prolonged ER stress also induces ATF4 and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein homologous
    protein  expression, leading to apoptosis.', 'To cope with ER stress, activated
    IRE-1 acts as an endonuclease to increase the X-box binding protein 1  splicing,
    thereby leading to upregulation of genes important for cell survival during ER
    stress.', 'ATF6 activation occurs after proteolytic cleavage in the Golgi, followed
    by its nuclear translocation for the adaptive stress response.', 'To some extent,
    ER stress plays a crucial role in tuning these signalling balances to manipulate
    the cells fate.', 'In this study, we investigated whether ER stress involves the
    fucoidan-induced cell apoptosis in the highly invasive and metastatic MDA-MB-231
    breast cancer cells  and HCT116 colon cancer cells.', We showed that fucoidan
    treatment regulates the ER Ca2+-modulated phosphorylation of CaMKII in a cell
    type-dependent manner., 'However, fucoidan treatment in both types of cancer cells
    activated the p-eIF2\CHOP pro-apoptotic cascade and inhibited the p-IRE-1/XBP-1s
    pro-survival cascade.', 'Therefore, ER stress contributes, at least in part, to
    fucoidan-induced cell apoptosis.', Human MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and HCT116
    colon cancer cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection  and
    cultured in Dulbeccos Modified Eagles Medium  supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
    serum., Cells were cultured at 37C with 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator., 'The

    cocktail inhibitors I and II and thapsigargin  were from Sigma-Aldrich., Lipofectamine
    2000 transfection reagents were supplied from Invitrogen., Salubrinal was purchased
    from Tocris Bioscence., Cell growth was assessed using the CellTiter96 AQueous
    One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay., 'In brief, cells were seeded in triplicate
    in 96-well plates at a density of 5000 cells per well in 100 l of the corresponding
    medium.', 'On the following day, the media were aspirated and replaced with fresh
    media containing the indicated concentrations of fucoidan.', 'Cells were incubated
    under standard culture conditions for up to 4 days, and viable cells were assessed.',
  The absorbance at 492 nm was measured using an Infinite F200 microplate reader.,
  Triplicate experiments were performed for each treatment., Cell viability was also
    examined using the trypan blue exclusion assay., Cell apoptosis was assayed using
    terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labelling  assay.,
  'Briefly, cells  were seeded in 6-well culture plates with coverslip and 24 h later,
    2 ml of fresh medium with fucoidan  was added to each well.', Cells were then
    treated for 3 days followed by TUNEL staining using the DeadEnd Fluorometric TUNEL
    system kit  according to the manufacturers protocol., The slides were mounted
    using antifade mounting fluid containing DAPI., Green  and blue  fluorescent signals
    were captured using an Olympus Fluoview FV1000 confocal laser scanning microscope.,
  The percentage of apoptotic cells was expressed as an average of five randomly selected
    fields., 'In addition, cell apoptosis was also examined by immunoblotting the
    expression of cleaved caspase 3 and cleaved Poly  polymerase.', 'Small interfering
    RNAs  targeting CHOP  and siGENOME non-targeting siRNA were used for CHOP knockdown
    and control, respectively.', 'Briefly, cells were grown in 6-well plates and transiently
    transfected at 6080% confluence with siRNA at a final concentration of 25 nM using
    Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent  according to the manufacturers instructions.',
  'Forty eight hours after transfection, the cells were incubated with fresh medium
    alone or medium with 100 g/ml of fucoidan.', 'After 3 days post-treatment, cells
    were harvested for analysing viability using trypan blue exclusion assay and assessing
    the levels of CHOP and cleaved PARP by immunoblot.', Cells at 7080% confluence
    were treated with fucoidan at various concentrations  for 3 days., Both the attached

    primary antibodies., Goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase  or goat anti-rabbit
    HRP secondary antibody  was used as secondary antibodies., The chemiluminescent
    signal was developed with Supersignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate., Signal
    intensity was analysed using GeneTools software., The level of -actin was used
    as a loading control., One-way analysis of variance  and Students t tests were
    used to analyse the significance of differences., p;0.05 was considered as significant.,
  All cell culture experiments were performed in triplicate., Data are presented as
    mean  standard deviation  and supplied in Table S1., Previous studies demonstrated
    a significant inhibition of fucidan on tumorigenesis and cancer cell metastasis
    ., 'To understand the effect of fucoidan on cell growth and apoptosis, both the
    metastatic MDA-MB-231 cells and HCT116 cells were treated with fucoidan at the
    indicated concentration for up to 4 days and the cell growth was assayed.', As
    shown in Fig., '1A, cell growth was significantly inhibited when the cells were
    treated with &gt;50 g/ml fucoidan on day 3 for MDA-MB-231 cells and on day 2 for
    HCT116 cells, compared to their respective control cells.', 'In addition, to determine
    whether cell apoptosis attributes to the inhibition of cell growth, both types
    of cells were treated with fucoidan  for 3 days and cell apoptosis was assessed
    by examining the expression of cleaved caspase 3 and TUNEL.', 'As indicated in
    Figure 1B, treatment of fucoidan at high doses  caused high expression of cleaved
    caspase 3 in both types of cells.', TUNEL analysis also showed an approximately
    &gt;25% cells undergoing DNA damage in fucoidan-treated cells., 'Hence, fucoidan
    treatment resulted in remarkable DNA damage in these cells.', Cell growth., Cells
    were treated with fucoidan at the indicated concentration and the viable cells
    were assessed using the CellTiter96 AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay.,
  Caspase 3 activation., Cells were treated with fucoidan for 3 days and the expression
    of cleaved caspase 3 was examined by Western blot., TUNEL., 'For TUNEL analysis,
    cells were treated with fucoidan at 100 g/ml for 3 days and the cell apoptosis
    was analysed using TUNEL assay.', Apoptotic cells  were counted in five randomly
    selected fields  and presented as a mean  SD of percentage of apoptotic cells
    over the total cells., Data are expressed as a mean  SD in triplicate experiments.,
  p&lt;0.05; p&lt;0.01., 'To investigate whether ER stress is involved in fucoidan-induced
    cell apoptosis, we initially examined the expression of ER stress markers including
    GRP78 and ERp29.', 'Interestingly, contrary to the cells treated with ER stress
    inducer TG,, the expression of GRP78 was decreased in the fucoidan-treated MDA-MB-231
    cells with no effect on ERp29 expression in these cells, relative to the control
    cells.', 'Instead, the expression of ERp29 was significantly reduced in the fucoidan-treated
    HCT116 cells, whereas the expression of GRP78 was slightly increased when the
    cells were treated with 5 g/ml, followed by reduction with high doses of treatments.',
  'GRP78 has multiple functions in cancer cells such as being responsible for cell
    proliferation, protecting cells from apoptosis and accelerating ER-associated
    protein degradation of misfolded proteins.', 'Recent studies have also addressed
    the role of ERp29 in cancer cell survival against chemo- and radio-therapy,.',
  The reduction of GRP78 or ERp29 in the fucoidan-treated cells suggests that fucoidan
    induces cell death by suppressing the expression of these survival proteins in
    MDA-MB-231 and HCT116 cells., Cells at 7080% confluence were treated with fucoidan
    at the indicated concentrations for 3 days and both the attached and suspended
    cells were harvested for protein expression analysis., 'The expression of GRP78,
    but not ERp29, was inhibited by fucoidan in MDA-MB-231 cells;  The expression
    of ERp29 was significantly attenuated by fucoidan in HCT116 cells, while GRP78
    was only slightly decreased  in cells treated with fucoidan at &gt;50 g/ml.',
  'As a positive control, cells were treated with ER stress inducer TG  for 24 h.
    Data represent mean  SD in triplicate experiments.', p&lt;0.05; p&lt;0.01., 'Because
    GRP78 can bind with the translocon in the ER membrane to block Ca2+ release into
    the cytosol, we next analyzed whether reduction of GRP78 in MDA-MB-231 cells could
    induce Ca2+-mediated activation of CaMKII and the expression of apoptosis-related
    proteins Bax.', As shown in Fig., '3A, the relative phosphorylation of CaMKII  was
    progressively increased in the cells treated with fucoidan compared to the control
    cells, indicating an activation of Ca2+\CaMKII signalling.', 'In line with this,
    Bax expression was also significantly increased and maintained at a similar level
    in the cells treated with fucoidan.', 'In contrast, comparing to the control cells,
    the relative phosphorylation of CaMKII  was moderately increased  in HCT116 cells
    treated with 10 g/ml of fucoidan, followed by reduction in those cells treated
    with 100 g/ml of fucoidan.', 'Overall, fucoidan treatment in HCT116 cells did
    not cause significant change of the relative phosphorylation of CaMKII and Bax
    expression.', 'We also found that the expression of caspase 12 was highly increased
    with fucoidan concentration in MDA-MB-231 cells, but not in HCT116 cells.', 'In
    addition, no cleavage of caspase 12 was observed when probing with antibody.',
  'Taken together, these data suggest that fucoidan regulates Ca2+\ CaMKII signalling
    and caspase 12 in a cell type-dependent manner.', Figure 3., Effect of fucoidan
    on the relative phosphorylation of CaMKII  and Bax expression in MDA-MB-231 cells  and
    HCT116 cells., 'Relative phosphorylation of CaMKII and Bax expression were progressively
    increased by fucoidan in MDA-MB-231 cells;  Relative phosphorylation of CaMKII
    was moderately stimulated  at 10 g/ml, followed by inhibition  of fucoidan at
    100 g/ml.', Bax expression was not affected by fucoidan in HCT116 cells., Caspase
    12 expression and cleavage., 'Fucoidan efficiently induces caspase 12 expression
    in MDA-MB-231 cells, rather than in HCT116 cells.', No cleavage of caspase 12
    was found in both types of cells., Data represent mean  SD from triplicate experiments.,
  p&lt;0.05; p&lt;0.01., 'Based on the above findings that fucoidan can modulate ER
    stress response in the cancer cells, we next examined whether fucoidan differentially
    regulates IRE-1\XBP-1 s, a cascade defining cell survival response via up-regulating
    the expression of chaperones for ER folding capacity, and the PERK\P-eIF2\CHOP
    pro-apoptotic cascade.', 'Compared to the control, fucoidan significantly inhibited
    the expression of XBP-1s in both types of cells.', 'This was caused by the decreased
    phosphorylation of IRE-1 in the fucoidan-treated cells, because the activated
    p-IRE-1 functions as an endonuclease to generate spliced XBP-1s from unspliced
    XBP-1 mRNA under ER stress.', 'In contrast to the TG-treated cells demonstrating
    enhanced IRE-1 phosphorylation and XBP-1s expression, these results indicate an
    inhibitory effect of fucoidan on ER stress-related cell survival cascade.', 'However,
    we did not observe a significant change of P58IPK, one of the downstream targets
    of XBP-1s and ATF6, in fucoidan-treated cells.', Figure 4., Fucoidan suppresses
    p-IRE-1\XBP-1 splicing in MDA-MB-231 cells  and HCT116 cells., Cells were treated
    with fucoidan as described in the Materials and Methods and in Figure 2., The
    phosphorylation of IRE-1  and XBP-1 splicing were remarkably reduced by fucoidan
    as assessed by immunoblot., 'Its downstream target, p58IPK, was not subsequently
    decreased.', Data are expressed as mean  SD in triplicate experiments., Note that
    TG-treated cells  showed an increased p-IRE-1 and XBP-1s in both cells., p&lt;0.05;
    p&lt;0.01., Phosphorylation of eIF2 is a classical mechanism for down-regulating
    global protein synthesis to cope with ER stress., 'Nevertheless, excessive ER
    stress also promotes cell death via upregulating ATF4\CHOP cascade.', It is thus
    speculated that this cascade is probably activated to participate in the fucoidan-induced
    cell apoptosis., 'Indeed, consistent with the TG-treated cells, the phosphorylation
    of eIF2 and expression of CHOP were progressively induced in a dose-dependent
    manner in both types of cells.', 'Therefore, fucoidan can induce ER stress-related
    pro-apoptotic cascade in these cancer cells.', Figure 5., Fucoidan activates p-eIF2\CHOP
    in MDA-MB-231 cells  and HCT116 cells., Cells were treated with fucoidan as described
    in the Materials and Methods and in Figure 2., The relative phosphorylation of
    eIF2  and CHOP expression were remarkably increased by fucoidan as assessed by
    immunoblot., TG treatment  induced activation of p-eIF2 and CHOP expression.,
  Data are expressed as mean  SD in triplicate experiments., p&lt;0.05; p&lt;0.01.,
  'Salubrinal is a selective inhibitor of eIF2 dephosphorylation and induces hyperphosphorylation
    of eIF2 by inhibiting GADD34-PP1C complex,.', 'To assess whether salubrinal treatment
    facilitates fucoidan-induced ER stress cascade, MDA-MB-231 and HCT116 cells were
    treated with salubrinal  alone or in combination with fucoidan  for 48 hours and
    the expression of p-eIF2 and CHOP was examined.', 'As indicated in Figure 6, cells
    treated with salubrinal and fucoidan showed higher expression of p-eIF2 phosphorylation
    and CHOP than the cells treated with salubrinal or fucoidan alone.', These data
    indicate a stimulative effect of fucoidan on the salubrinal-induced p- eIF2 \CHOP
    cascade., Figure 6., Combinatory treatment of fucoidan and salubrinal enhances
    eIF2 phosphorylation and CHOP expression in MDA-MB-231 cells and HCT116 cells.,
  Cells were treated with salubrinal  alone or in combination with fucoidan  for 48
    h. Cell lysates  were applied for the analysis of the expression of p-eIF2 and
    CHOP by immunoblot., p&lt;0.01; p&lt;0.001., 'To assess whether the fucoidan-induced
    CHOP in both types of cancer cells is linked to the observed cell apoptosis, cells
    were treated with siRNA targeting CHOP to reduce its endogenous levels or treated
    with scramble siRNA as a control.', Our preliminary studies showed that both types
    of cells treated with 25 nM siRNA for 48 h could lead to &gt;70% repression of
    CHOP expression compared to those treated with control siRNA., These cells were
    then treated with fucoidan  for 2 days and CHOP expression and DNA damage  were
    analyzed., As shown in Fig., '7A, the level of CHOP was reduced by 7090% of the
    controls in both types of cells after treatment.', 'In the cells pre-treated with
    siRNA control, fucoidan treatment markedly increased CHOP expression and PARP
    cleavage over the cells with no fucoidan treatment.', 'In contrast, fucoidan treatment
    was unable to induce CHOP expression and PARP cleavage in the CHOP-silenced cells,
    indicating that silencing CHOP is able to block fucoidan-induced expression of
    cleaved PARP.', These data provide evidence that CHOP participates in fucoidan-induced
    DNA damage., Figure 7., Effect of silencing CHOP on fucoidan-induced DNA damage
    and cytotoxicity., CHOP knockdown by siRNA inhibits fucoidan-induced expression
    of cleaved PARP., 'Cells at 7080% confluence were treated with CHOP siRNA or scramble
    siRNA for 48 h, followed by fucoidan treatment  for 2 days.', The levels of CHOP
    and cleaved PARP were assessed by immunoblot., Silencing CHOP antagonizes fucoidan-induced
    cell death., Cells pre-treated with CHOP siRNA or control siRNA were treated with
    fucoidan  for 2 days and the cell viability was examined using the trypan blue
    exclusion assay., Cell viability was expressed as a percentage of the siRNA control
    cells without fucoidan treatment., Note that CHOP knockdown alone does not affect
    cell viability in both types of cells., 'Instead, CHOP knockdown remarkably prevents
    cell apoptosis induced by fucoidan at 100 g/ml.', Results are interpreted as mean  of
    triplicate experiments., p&lt;0.05; p&lt;0.01., 'To examine the effect of CHOP
    knockdown on the fucoidan-induced cell apoptosis, cell viability of these treated
    cells was examined.', 'Relative to the cell viability of the siRNA control cells
    without fucoidan treatment, the cell viability in the CHOP-silenced cells was
    similar to that observed in these control cells, indicating that silencing CHOP
    alone could not affect the cell viability.', 'In the cells pre-treated with control
    siRNA, fucoidan treatment led to approximately 5060% reduction of cell viability
    compared to those without fucoidan treatment.', 'However, fucoidan treatment only
    caused approximately 1020% reduction of cell viability in the CHOP-silenced cells.',
  'Of note, repression of CHOP in both types of cells led to a significant increase
    of cell viability after fucoidan treatment compared to the cells treated with
    control siRNA and fucoidan.', 'Taken together, these results suggest that knockdown
    of CHOP could protect cells from fucoidan-induced cell apoptosis.', Fucoidan has
    been demonstrated to be a novel therapeutic agent for cancer treatment., 'Mechanistic
    studies revealed that fucoidan can suppress cancer cell survival, tumorigenesis
    and metastasis by modulating multiple signalling pathways,, .', 'In the present
    study, we demonstrate that fucoidan modulates ER stress cascades in cancer cells
    and the activated CHOP expression is responsible for fucoidan-induced cell apoptosis.',
  ER stress triggers a number of processes necessary for apoptosis., 'One of them
    is release of ER Ca2+ stores into the cytosol to activate the Ca2+-signal transducer
    CaMKII, leading to apoptosis through:  activation of c-Jun N terminal kinase  to
    induce death receptor Fas ;  stimulation of Ca2+ uptake by the mitochondria and
    release of apoptogens.', 'Hence, CaMKII activation by ER Ca2+ leak plays a crucial
    role in apoptosis.', 'However, we observed that fucoidan treatment induced activation
    of p-CaMKII in MDA-MB-231 cells rather than in HCT116 cells.', 'Consistently,
    the mitochondrial apoptotic protein Bax and the ERassociated caspase 12 were significantly
    increased in fucoidan-treated MDA-MB-231 cells.', 'Considering that GRP78 can
    binds to ER Ca2+ and translocon in the ER membrane to block ER Ca2+ leak, this
    can be explained by the fact that fucoidan treatment in MDA-MB-231 cells, not
    in HCT116 cells, caused reduction of cytoprotective GRP78, thereby leading to
    ER Ca2+ leak into cytosol to activate CaMKII phosphorylation.', 'In contrast,
    there was no significant change of CaMKII phosphorylation and Bax and caspase
    12 expression in fucoidan-treated HCT116 cells, although CaMKII phosphorylation
    was moderately enhanced by fucoidan at 10 g/ml and inhibited at 100 g/ml.', This
    is probably consistent with the observation that the expression of GRP78 was not
    significantly affected by fucoidan in HCT116 cells., 'However, the effect of fucoidan-induced
    downregulation of ERp29 on the moderate reduction of CaMKII phosphorylation in
    HCT116 cells should not be excluded.', 'In addition, it has been reported that
    the ER-associated, Ca2+-induced caspase 12 activation is also implicated in ER
    stress-induced apoptosis, however, we did not observed activation of pro-caspase
    12  in fucoidan-treated cells, suggesting that this caspase cascade may not be
    activated.', 'Because GRP78 and ERp29 are essential ER proteins in maintaining
    the ER homeostasis and functions such as folding and secretion of proteins and
    degradation of misfolded proteins,, it is plausible that fucoidan potentiates
    damage to ERs function through attenuating the expression of GRP78 or ERp29 in
    a cell context dependent manner, where the precise mechanisms need to be further
    explored.', 'ER stress-mediated signalling pathways are coupled to two main cascades:
    cell death-related PERK\P-eIF2\CHOP cascade and cell survival-related AFT6 \XBP-1
    splicing cascade.', 'To cope with ER stress, XBP-1 mRNA is spliced by the activated
    p-IRE-1 to generate XBP-1s.', XBP-1s is a highly active transcription factor and
    is one of the key regulators of ER folding capacity., Recent studies have shown
    that prolongation of IRE-1 signalling during ER stress can promote cell survival.,
  'Hence, attenuation of this cascade could trigger cell apoptosis.', 'Indeed, our
    studies demonstrated that fucoidan treatment significantly prevented XBP-1 splicing
    through inhibition of IRE-1 phosphorylation.', 'On the other hand, our data also
    showed that fucoidan treatment could activate phosphotylation of eIF2 in both
    types of cells, similar to those observed in the cells treated with the inhibitor
    of eIF2 dephosphorylation, salubrinal.', 'Moreover, these cells treated with salubrinal
    and fucoidan led to increased levels of p-eIF2 and CHOP over the cells treated
    with salubrinal alone.', 'Although it is uncertain whether the fucoidan-induced
    increase of eIF2 phosphorylation is caused by the activated PERK in the ER or
    other kinases involved in the integrated stress response such as the general control
    nonrepressed 2 protein kinase and heme-regulated inhibitor,, cellular activation
    of p-eIF2\CHOP by fucoidan potentially leads to cell apoptosis in these cancer
    cells.', Recent study indicated a function of fucoidan in inducing ER stress-related
    autophagy and cell apoptosis in AGS cells., It is thus suggested a central role
    of ER stress in fucoidan-induced cell apoptosis., 'Taken together, our studies
    reveal that fucoidan can broadly activate excessive ER stress cascades and subsequently
    induces cell apoptosis.', CHOP is a key regulator of ER stress-induced apoptosis.,
  'It regulates gene expression by forming hetero-dimers with other proteins from
    the C/EBP family or other transcription factors, acting as an activator or inhibitor
    of gene transcription.', 'In response to ER stress, DNA damage or other stress
    conditions, CHOP is induced to drive cell apoptosis by a variety of mechanisms
    including induction of oxidative stress and down-regulation of the anti-apoptotic
    protein Bcl2.', The role of CHOP in fucoidan-induced cell apoptosis in MDA-MB-231
    and HCT116 cells was verified by the fact that CHOP knockdown prevented DNA damage
    and cell death from fucoidan treatment., 'Therefore, the fucoidan-induced CHOP
    is responsible for fucoidan-induced cell apoptosis.', Fucoidan treatment may result
    in the excessive phosphorylation of eIF2 to activate CHOP for the induction of
    cell apoptosis in cancer cells., 'In summary, our studies provide definitive evidence
    that ER stress cascades play a critical role in fucoidan-induced cell apoptosis.',
  Fucoidan broadly regulates ER stress by attenuating cell survival cascade and activating
    cell apoptotic cascade in cancer cells., The efficiency of fucoidan in killing
    cancer cells and preventing metastasis indicates its promising potential as a
    therapeutic agent in cancer treatment., 'Conceived and designed the experiments:
