text: [Anti-proliferative activity of essential oil from 17 Thai medicinal plants
    on human mouth epidermal carcinoma  and murine leukemia  cell lines using MTT
    assay were investigated., An amount of 1 x 10cells/well of KB cell line and 1
    x 10 cells/well of P388 cell line were treated with the oil samples at different
    concentrations ranging from 0.019 to 4.962 mg/ml., 'In KB cell line, Guava  leaf
    oil showed the highest anti-proliferative activity with the IC value of 0.0379
    mg/ml  whereas Sweet Basil  oil gave the highest anti-proliferative activity with
    the IC value of 0.0362 mg/ml  in P388 cell line.', The results demonstrated the
    potential of essential oil from Thai medicinal plants for cancer treatment.]
