text: [Broccoli and broccoli sprouts have been shown to suppress inflammation and
    to be cardioprotective., 'In addition, broccoli can inhibit urinary bladder carcinogenesis,
    and reduce the risk of occurrence of multiple myeloma and lung, gallbladder, ovarian,
    cervical, stomach, prostate, small intestine and colorectal cancer.', 'Broccoli
    contains numerous substances with suspected or demonstrated cancer fighting properties,
    including sulforaphane, quercetin, sinigrin, enterolactone, kaempferol glycosides,
    beta-carotene, indole-3-carbinol, 3,3-diindolylmethane, and several other glucosinolates.',
  'Broccoli has been found to promote apoptosis, suppress cell cycle progression and
    inhibit angiogenesis of human breast cancer cells.', 'Consumption of broccoli
    has been shown to reduce the estrogen metabolite 16alpha-hydroxyestrone, which
    is a breast cancer promoter, and to be marginally inversely associated with breast
    cancer risk in a population of premenopausal women.', 'Broccoli components quercetin,
    I3C and sulforaphane have all been shown increase the anti-cancer effects of the
    chemotherapy drug Taxol.', Broccoli sprouts are particularly rich in anticancer
    nutrients., Broccoli sprouts generally are safer to eat compared to some other
    sprouts., Stir frying preserves most of the presumed cancer-fighting chemicals
    in broccoli whereas after boiling only 14-28% of the individual glucosides are
    retained in the cooked tissue., 'Similarly, if broccoli is microwaved, it should
    be done for the shortest period of time and with the least amount of water possible
    to minimize leaching of phenolic compounds and glucosinolates into water.', Even
    the light blanching used in making frozen broccoli substantially reduces the bioavailability
    of sulforaphane., We recommend consuming broccoli as food and against consuming
    broccoli pills that have been enhanced to boost the proportion of the presumed
    key anti-cancer chemicals in broccoli., There is some evidence that concentrated
    cruciferous vegetable extracts can act as estrogen agonists and promote breast
    cancer cell proliferation., 'Also, the anticancer properties of broccoli are likely
    to be the result of synergistic interaction of its various chemical components
    - isolated components have successfully inhibited proliferation in the laboratory,
    but their efficacy and safety in humans needs to be evaluated in large scale clinical
    trials.', Cruciferous vegetables contain thioglucoside compounds that can interfere
    with the formation of thyroid hormone., Below are links to recent studies concerning
    this food., 'For a more complete list of studies, please click on broccoli.']
