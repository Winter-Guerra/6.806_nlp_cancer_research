text: ['Mushrooms have been shown to have anti-inflammatory, antiviral, cholesterol-reducing,
    and immune-enhancing properties, as well helping to reduce blood pressure and
    blood sugar levels.', 'Generally speaking, mushrooms are a good source of dietary
    selenium and vitamin D, as well as some B vitamins.', White button mushrooms are
    a good source of conjugated linoleic acid., Consumption of mushrooms was found
    to be associated with lower risk of heart disease in one European study., 'Mushrooms
    contain numerous compounds with anti-cancer activities, including various -glucans
    and lectins, butein, ganodermanontriol, grifolin, lentinan, marmorin, and nebrodeolysin.',
  'Various mushroom extracts have been shown to reduce proliferation and/or induce
    apoptosis of human bladder, cervical, colorectal, esophageal, head and neck, kidney,
    leukemia, liver, lymphoma, multiple myeloma, non-small cell lung, ovarian, pancreas,
    prostate, spleen, and stomach cancer cells, as well as malignant glioma cells.',
  'Mushroom extracts also have been shown to prolong survival of mice inoculated with
    melanoma cells, inhibit the growth of human colon cells in mice, and induce apoptosis
    of colon cancer cells in mice.', 'A case-control study of 1,009 Chinese breast
    cancer patients found that mushroom consumption was inversely related to breast
    cancer risk.', A study of Korean breast cancer patients also found consumption
    of mushrooms to be associated with a significantly decreased risk of breast cancer.,
  Another Korean study found that both high daily intake and high consumption frequency
    of mushrooms was associated with reduced risk of breast cancer among postmenopausal
    women., Many types of mushroom appear to have beneficial effects with respect
    to breast cancer prevention., "The information below concerns mushrooms commonly
    available in the U.S.\n\n   White button mushrooms  are the most common mushrooms
    sold in supermarkets.", 'They are also known as button mushrooms, white mushrooms,
    or table mushrooms.', Portobello and crimini mushrooms are closely related to
    white button mushrooms., 'Of the mushrooms studied, white button mushrooms have
    among the most powerful proven breast cancer chemopreventive properties, since
    they have been shown to suppress aromatase activity and estrogen biosynthesis,
    in addition to inhibiting proliferation of estrogen receptor positive  breast
    cancer cells.', 'Several studies have concluded that diets high in white button
    mushrooms may lower the risk of estrogen receptor positive breast cancer, especially
    in postmenopausal women, by reducing aromatase activity.', Maitake mushrooms  are
    sold dried or fresh in upscale supermarkets and specialty markets., 'Maitake mushrooms
    have been shown to reduce growth, inhibit angiogenesis, and induce apoptosis of
    human breast cancer cells in the laboratory.', 'However, a 2009 trial of maitake
    mushroom supplementation in postmenopausal breast cancer survivors found that,
    contrary to expectations, the maitake extract had both immune enhancing and immune
    suppressant effects at various doses.', Shiitake mushrooms  are widely available
    fresh or dried in grocery stores and specialty markets., Shiitake mushrooms have
    been found to inhibit increases in tumor volume of human breast cancer cells implanted
    in mice., 'Reishi mushrooms  usually are sold only in powder form in capsules,
    in liquid extracts and as tea, since they are too bitter and tough to be eaten
    as food.', 'Reishi mushroom extracts have been shown to inhibit proliferation,
    adhesion, angiogenesis, migration, and invasion of several types of breast cancer
    cells.', 'The addition of green tea extract to reishi extract has been shown to
    have a synergistic effect in the inhibiting adhesion, migration and invasion of
    hormone receptor negative  breast cancer cells.', 'Reishi extract has been shown
    to be effective in inhibiting inflammatory breast cancer  progression, one of
    the few foods to have demonstrated beneficial impact on this form of the disease.',
  'While reishi mushroom extracts have been shown to have anti-cancer activities against
    ER+/PR+ breast cancer cells, they have also been shown to have estrogenic properties.',
  'Therefore, we would advise those at high risk for breast cancer and those with
    non-IBC ER+ breast cancer against consuming reishi.', 'Generally speaking, we
    would be very cautious about consuming mushroom supplements because safe and effective
    dosages have not been established.', Raw white button mushrooms have been shown
    to cause various cancers when consumed by mice., 'A 2005 study found that the
    risk of breast cancer for Latina mushroom agricultural workers in California was
    sharply higher than the risk for any other type of agriculture, for reasons that
    are not clear.', This high risk may have been the result of pesticide use in enclosed
    areas or contaminants in the compost., 'In addition to neutralizing the carcinogenic
    compounds in raw mushrooms, cooking would serve to eradicate any pathogenic bacteria
    on the surface of the mushrooms.', 'It makes sense to thoroughly clean and cook
    any white button, Portobello, crimini or related mushrooms before consuming them.',
