text: ['In the U.S., herring are often consumed as sardines, which are either young
    herring or small fish that are members of the herring family.', 'Scandinavians
    and some Asian populations have relatively high rates of herring consumption,
    and many of the pickled or salted herring food products available in the U.S.
    are imported from those regions.', 'Herring is a good source of vitamin D, vitamin
    B6, coenzyme Q10, selenium and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids.', 'Generally
    speaking, the benefits of consuming fatty fish are thought to outweigh the potentially
    detrimental effects of the toxins from pollution and other sources that tend to
    accumulate in their adipose tissue.', Sardines contain fewer toxins than full
    grown herring., Consumption of fatty fish or fish oil has been found to reduce
    the risk of coronary heart disease., Intake of oven-baked herring has been shown
    to increase HDL cholesterol., 'However, note that several Danish studies and an
    Icelandic study have found that high fatty fish intake during pregnancy  was inversely
    associated with fetal growth, apparently because of polychlorinated biphenyls  concentrations
    in the fish.', 'In addition, a Norwegian study found elevated levels of PCBs in
    the breast milk of women who regularly consumed fish.', 'Swedish studies have
    found that the consumption of fatty fish, but not lean fish, was associated with
    lower risks of endometrial cancer, renal cell carcinoma, non-Hodgkins lymphoma
    and chronic lymphocytic lymphoma.', 'Eating fatty fish such as herring has also
    been found to be associated with reduced risks of leukemia and multiple myeloma,
    as well as endometrial and prostate cancer.', 'Like other fatty fish, herring
    contains the marine fatty acids docosahexaenoic acid  and eicosapentaenoic acid,
    which have chemopreventive properties.', These marine fatty acids have been shown
    to inhibit proliferation of breast cancer cells in the laboratory., Relatively
    high fatty fish intake has been shown to be associated with reduced risk of breast
    cancer and improved survival., 'In one experiment, diets incorporating higher
    omega-3 to omega-6 fatty acid ratios reduced mammary gland density in mice, which
    in turn reduced carcinogen-induced mammary tumor development.', Fish oil has been
    shown to inhibit early stages of mammary tumor development in a mouse model of
    HER-2/neu overexpressing  breast cancer., DHA has been demonstrated to reduce
    bone metastasis in a mouse model of breast cancer., 'Many epidemiological studies
    have found convincing evidence of a negative association between DHA and EPA intake
    or fatty fish consumption and the risk of breast cancer, but not all are in agreement.',
  'A study of Finnish fishermen and their wives found that while their high fish consumption
    appeared to reduce mortality overall, it did not reduce mortality from cancer
    in the women.', 'A Swedish study comparing the breast cancer rates of two large
    groups of fishermens wives found a lower risk of breast cancer for those residing
    on the west coast of Sweden compared to the east  coast, where the fish are known
    to be contaminated with more organochlorine compounds.', Several studies have
    found that higher omega-3/omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid ratios are associated
    with reduced risk of breast cancer and consuming herring or similar fish would
    tend to improve this ratio for most women., Marine fatty acids have also been
    found to enhance the therapeutic effects of tamoxifen and chemotherapy drugs such
    as Adriamycin and Taxol., 'However, note that recent research suggests that herring,
    sardines and similar fish such as anchovies should not be consumed the day before
    through the day after a chemotherapy treatment and consumed only in moderation
    during the remaining days of each cycle.', Herring and similar fish contain a
    fatty acid  that can induce resistance to a broad spectrum of chemotherapy drugs.,
  Anchovies are also members of the herring family and are a good source of omega-3
    fatty acids., 'Drained filleted anchovies packed in oil have more vitamin A and
    vitamin E than similarly packaged sardines, but less vitamin D. However, anchovies
    usually have a great deal of sodium, which makes them inappropriate for those
    who need to limit their salt consumption and not suitable as a regular source
    of omega-3 fatty acids for breast cancer patients and survivors.', 'We recommend
    against consuming all but modest amounts of pickled or dried herring, since such
    preserved fish foods have been associated with increased risks of gastric, colorectal
    and other cancers.', Pan frying fish has been shown to release carcinogenic heterocyclic
    amines  in concentrations high enough to affect human health., Population studies
    have found that consumption of fried fish is associated with increased risk of
    breast cancer., Herring consumption should be reduced or eliminated by pregnant
    and nursing mothers since toxins from pollution and other sources have been found
    to reduce birth weight and are secreted in breast milk., Below are links to recent
    studies concerning this food., 'For a more complete list, including less recent
