text: ['The canola plant was developed in Canada during the 1970s using conventional
    selective breeding and hybrid propagation techniques  from turnip rapeseed, black
    mustard, and leaf mustard.', 'Rapeseed is high in erucic acid, an unhealthy fatty
    acid that is associated with increased risk of breast cancer, but the canola plant
    was developed to minimize this component.', Canola oil is made from the pressed
    seed of the canola plant., Canola oil is low in saturated fat and has a high monounsaturated
    fat content., 'It contains oleic acid, linoleic acid and alpha-linolenic acid;
    the oil is a good source of non-marine omega-3 fatty acids.', 'Canola oil is also
    a dietary source of vitamin E and vitamin K.


    Canola oil has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.', 'In one study,
    consumption of canola oil was found to lower LDL-cholesterol and improve endothelial
    function in subjects with peripheral arterial occlusive disease, indicating that
    canola oil might provide cardiovascular protection.', Canola oil was shown to
    prevent diabetic renal injury in diabetic rates in another study., Canola meal  has
    been shown to reduce the tumor incidence and volume of both melanoma and colon
    cancer in mice., Canola oil has been shown to inhibit growth and induce apoptosis
    in both estrogen positive  and estrogen negative  human breast cancer cells.,
  'Female mammary gland cancer-prone rats consuming canola oil during pregnancy have
    been found to produce offspring with lower tumor numbers, lower tumor volume and
    lower percentage of mice with tumors than the offspring of mothers on a diet with
    equivalent amounts of corn oil.', Several studies have found that higher omega-3/omega-6
    fatty acid ratios are associated with reduced risk of breast cancer; using canola
    oil would tend to improve the ratio for most women., A 2008 San Francisco population
    study found that women cooking mainly with olive/canola oil have a lower risk
    of breast cancer than those cooking with vegetable/corn oil or hydrogenated fats.,
  Frying with canola oil  has been shown to release carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic
    hydrocarbons  in the cooking oil smoke and fumes., Breathing such fumes should
    be avoided since this has been associated with increased risk of lung cancer in
    several population studies., 'While the canola plant was developed using conventional
    methods, the majority of current canola production comes from genetically modified
    plants developed for their resistance to herbicides.', Organic canola oil is available
    for those concerned about consuming genetically modified foods., 'Possibly because
    of its connection with rapeseed oil, canola oil has been the subject of many alarming
    negative  health-related claims, especially on the internet.', 'As mentioned above,
    rapeseed oil is high in erucic acid  and should be avoided.', Rapeseed oil normally
    is not sold in U.S. supermarkets but it can be found as an ingredient in some
    processed foods such as commercial peanut butter., 'Be aware that in Europe, canola
    oil is referred to as rape oil or rapeseed oil but it is, in fact, canola oil.',
  Below are links to recent studies concerning this food., 'For a more complete list
