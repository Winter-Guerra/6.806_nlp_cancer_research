text: ['Diets high in bacon and other processed meats have been linked in population
    studies to higher risks of leukemia, stomach cancer, colorectal cancer, esophageal
    cancer, brain cancer, lung cancer, bladder cancer, pancreatic cancer, and prostate
    cancer.', 'Processed meats include those that are salted, cured, smoked or preserved,
    including hot dogs, sausage, ham, bologna, other sandwich or luncheon meats, pts,
    salami, pepperoni, and beef jerky, to name a few.', Fresh pork is covered in another
    web page., Processed meats tend to have high saturated fat content., Sodium nitrite
    and related compounds are normally added to processed meats to preserve their
    freshness and coloring., 'Sodium nitrite has been shown to react with chemicals
    in the stomach to produce nitrosamines, which are known to be cancer-promoting.',
  'In addition to their nitrite content, the carcinogenic potential of processed meats
    appears to be related to the effects of frying or broiling, which have been shown
    to produce mutagenic compounds such as heterocyclic amines  and polycyclic aromatic
    hydrocarbons.', 'One study reported that fried bacon had a higher level of HCAs
    than fried pork, fried beef and fried chicken.', A large 2007 U.K. study found
    that both premenopausal and postmenopausal women with the highest processed meat
    intake had the highest risk of breast cancer., Another study found that higher
    red meat consumption during adolescence was associated with increased risk of
    premenopausal breast cancer in adulthood., 'A study of tissue removed from healthy
    women undergoing breast reduction surgery found that the levels of DNA adducts  in
    the breast tissue was correlated with the womens consumption of fried meat, beef
    and processed meat.', 'High intake of animal fats has been linked in several studies
    to increased breast density, a risk factor for breast cancer and recurrence.',
  Another study found that consumption of well done or fried meat  appeared to increase
    the risk of breast cancer in a dose-dependent manner., 'A study that examined
    the risks of recurrence and death following diagnosis with early-stage breast
    cancer found that both the risk of recurrence and the risk of death were positively
    correlated with the consumption of bacon, especially for premenopausal women.',
  'Generally speaking, bacon-like products made from turkey, beef, and combinations
    of pork and turkey also contain sodium nitrite and form carcinogenic nitrosamines
    when consumed, however the levels tend to be lower than traditional bacon.', Below
    are links to recent studies concerning this food., 'For a more complete list of
