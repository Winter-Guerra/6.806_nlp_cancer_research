text: ['Rhubarb is a good source of vitamin C, calcium, magnesium and dietary fiber.',
  'Rhubarb contains the carotenoids lutein and zeaxanthin, which have been shown to
    have some anticancer activities.', 'Rhubarb has also been shown to have anti-inflammatory,
    anti-atherosclerosis and plaque-stabilizing actions in laboratory animals.', 'Rhubarb
    contains the polyphenol -3,5,4-Trimethoxystilbene, a resveratrol analog that has
    been shown to arrest the growth of human colon cancer cells in a dose dependent
    manner.', 'Piceatannol, another polyphenol in rhubarb, has been shown to exert
    immunosuppressive, antileukemic, and antitumorigenic activities, including inhibition
    of the proliferation of human bladder and prostate cancer cells.', 'The most abundant
    anthraquinone of rhubarb, emodin  has been shown to induce apoptosis in human
    pancreatic, liver, prostate and breast cancer cell lines.', 'Rhein, another component
    of rhubarb, has been found to induce apoptosis of nasopharyngeal cancer cells.',
  'Because rhubarb typically does not comprise a large portion of the diet of any
    group of people, there are no population-based studies that specifically isolate
    any associations between consuming rhubarb and the risk of cancer.', 'Rhein, a
    constituent of rhubarb, is the major component of several traditional Chinese
    herbal medicines, including laxatives and stomach remedies.', 'Rhein herb-drug
    interactions, especially cytochrome P450 -mediated interactions, may cause an
    enhancement or attenuation in the efficacy of prescription drugs.', There are
    some available rhubarb-based herbal remedies designed to treat menopausal symptoms
    in women and containing the phenolic gallylglucoside lindleyin., Lindleyin is
    a phytoestrogen which has demonstrated estrogenic activity., 'I recommend against
    using such remedies for breast cancer patients, survivors and those at high risk
    for breast cancer since their safety has not been demonstrated.', 'In particular,
    it is possible that lindleyin could promote beast cancer through its estrogenic
    activity.', Rhubarb should not be consumed by pregnant women since it may trigger
    uterine contractions., Consuming large amounts of rhubarb to obtain the possible
    benefit of its anticancer components would be impractical since a great deal of
    sweetener is required to counteract rhubarbs sourness and since the gastrointestinal
    effects could be overwhelming., 'However, we would not recommend consuming concentrated
    rhubarb extracts or pills since their safety and efficacy have not been established.',
  Rhubarb leaves should not be consumed since they are poisonous., 'Rhubarb is a component
    of Essiac tea, a herbal tea sometimes used as a cancer treatment, primarily for
    prostate cancer, but also for breast cancer.', 'While the tea has been shown in
    the laboratory to have potent antioxidant and DNA-protective activity, one careful
    study found no observable action of Essiac against prostate cancer cells.', A
    2006 study reported that Essiac can stimulate breast cancer cell growth., 'Note
    that while we are continually searching for new evidence specifically concerning
    this food, there is not much interest in it among breast cancer researchers, so
    few studies are available.']
