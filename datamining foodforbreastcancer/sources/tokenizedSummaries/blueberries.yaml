text: [Blueberries rank among the highest of all fruits and vegetables in the capacity
    to destroy free radicals., 'Blueberries contain caffeic acid, catechin, chlorogenic
    acid, epicatechin, ferulic acid, gallic acid, kaempferol, myricetin, naringenin,
    p-coumaric acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, pterostilbene, resveratrol, quercetin,
    and ursolic acid, most of which have been reported to have anti-cancer properties.',
  'Blueberries have been found to inhibit mammary cancer cell proliferation in mice
    and rats, as well as inhibiting cultured cancer cell growth in the laboratory
    and blood vessel tumors in rats.', Pterostilbene has been shown to inhibit obesity-related
    breast cancer growth and proliferation in the laboratory and to have additive
    treatment effects when combined with tamoxifen in estrogen receptor positive  breast
    cancer cells., Pterostilbene also has been shown to reduce the formation of breast
    cancer stem cells and inhibit their metastatic activities., 'Blueberries are a
    good source of resveratrol, which has been shown to increase the effects of radiation,
    aromatase inhibitors and the chemotherapy drug Taxol  against breast cancer.',
  Blueberry extract has been shown to exhibit antitumor activity against MDA-MB-231
    triple negative breast cancer cells and reduce their metastatic potential., Blueberry
    was found to inhibit cell proliferation in triple negative cells with no effect
    on normal breast cells in one study., Blueberry also reduced the metastatic potential
    of triple negative cells through inhibition of cell motility., 'In animal studies,
    dietary blueberry has been shown to reduce triple negative tumor volume in female
    mice.', Blueberry diets reduced triple negative proliferation  and increased cell
    death., 'In addition, a blueberry diet inhibited triple negative tumor metastasis
    in another mouse study.', 'Analysis of tumor tissues has demonstrated that blueberry-fed
    mice tumors have significantly altered expression of genes important to inflammation,
    cancer, and metastasis.', 'The antioxidant properties of blueberries have been
    shown to be reduced when eaten with milk, suggesting that the best way to gain
    maximum benefits from blueberries and other fruits eaten for their polyphenol
    content is to consume them either one hour before or two hours after protein is
    consumed.', Non-organic blueberries must be washed very thoroughly to remove pesticide
    residue as much as possible., 'Bilberries, which grow wild in much of northern
    Europe, are closely related to blueberries.', They are valued for their high flavonoid
    content., Below are links to recent studies concerning this food., 'For a more
