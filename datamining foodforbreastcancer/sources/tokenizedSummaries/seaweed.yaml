text: ['The category of seaweed, or ocean vegetables, includes edible seaweed or algae
    such as dulse, kelp, nori, and sea lettuce.', 'Generally speaking, seaweed is
    a good dietary source of calcium, iodine, iron, potassium, and fiber.', 'Various
    seaweeds have been shown to have anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anticoagulant,
    and antibiotic properties.', 'Some varieties are also good sources of vitamin
    A, vitamin B12, vitamin C, vitamin E, vitamin K, manganese, magnesium, selenium,
    copper, or zinc.', Seaweed can be a rich source of carotenoids., 'For example,
    brown seaweeds contain beta-carotene, fucoxanthin, and violaxanthin.', 'In addition,
    seaweed contains some unique compounds, such as various fucoidans, stearidonic
    acid, phlorotannins, mycosporine-like amino acids and phenolic acid, all of which
    have been shown to have anticancer properties in the laboratory.', Various extracts
    of seaweed have been shown to inhibit the growth of colon and breast cancer cells
    in the laboratory., "The evidence that seaweed consumption could reduce the risk
    of breast cancer is based primarily on studies of brown seaweeds:\n\n   Consumption
    of brown seaweeds has been shown to favorably alter estrogen metabolism in women.",
  Extract of common kelp has been shown to inhibit the binding of estradiol to estrogen
    receptors and progesterone to the progesterone receptor., "Bladderwrack  has been
    found to exert anti-estrogenic effects in pre-menopausal women\n   Specific unique
    components  of brown seaweeds have been shown to inhibit cancer cell proliferation.",
  "However, red seaweeds, which lack these compounds, also inhibit proliferation,
    suggesting that other compounds found in seaweed may also be important\n   Seaweed
    in the Asian diet may enhance intestinal conversion of phytoestrogens, in particular
    the production of equol, which could explain some of the breast cancer protective
    effects of dietary seaweed and soy\n   The brown seaweed wakame  has been shown
    to contain the omega-3 fats eicosapentaenoic acid and stearidonic acid, which
    may favorably increase the omega-3/omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid ratio.",
  "Some other types of seaweed have been found to contain docosahexaenoic acid, another
    marine omega-3 fat\n   Wakame was also found to reduce breast cancer proliferation
    in rats in one Japanese study\n   Mekabu  extract has been shown to induce cell
    death in human hormone receptor negative  breast cancer cells and to suppress
    mammary carcinogenesis in rats when administered in daily drinking water, without
    toxicity\n   Various types of red, brown and green algae have been found to be
    good sources of melatonin.", "Melatonin protects against breast cancer in several
    ways, including by reducing aromatase activity within the breast, thereby reducing
    estrogen production\n   The relatively high iodine content of seaweed may contribute
    to reduction in risk of breast cancer\n   The relatively high levels of calcium
    found in seaweed are also thought to contribute to seaweeds chemopreventive effects,
    in combination with its other components.", 'We suggest consuming seaweed as food
    rather than fucoidan, kelp or other seaweed supplements since  as outlined above,
    various components of seaweed in addition to fucoidan or iodine may be responsible
    for seaweeds apparent anti-carcinogenic effects;  the compounds, minerals and
    fiber found in seaweed may act synergistically to reduce cancer risk;  safe and
    effective levels of fucoidan have not been established;  supplementation may result
    in increased blood thinning, depending on the formulation.', Most seaweed is dried
    after being harvested and must be rehydrated before use., Nori is a common seaweed
    ingredient in sushi., 'Currently, in the U.S., seaweeds are used mainly as a source
    of gums, gelling compounds and thickeners  for use in foods such as ice cream,
    and some industrial applications.', Seaweed readily incorporates minerals from
    the surrounding water; minerals can account for more than one-third of seaweed
    dry matter., 'While this can make various seaweeds a rich source of beneficial
    micronutrients, it can also make them a dietary source of heavy metals, including
    arsenic.', One analysis of dried seaweed samples purchased in London and over
    the Internet found that some contained unacceptable levels of arsenic., 'On the
    other hand, one study found that wakame is effective in preventing the absorption
    and reabsorption of dioxin from the gastrointestinal tract and therefore might
    be useful in treatment of humans exposed to dioxin.', 'Several types of freshwater
    microalgae, including spirulina and other types of blue-green algae, have been
    marketed as supplements in the U.S. since the early 1980s.', 'Blue-green algae
    contain the omega-3 fatty acid alpha-linolenic acid, which has been shown to have
    chemopreventive activities.', 'However, such freshwater algae can also contain
    concentrated amounts of heavy metals, as well as toxic microcystins, depending
    on where it is grown.', 'Whether or not they contain heavy metals, many microalgaes
    are not edible.', 'In fact, they may be harmful if consumed, and there have been
    instances of microalgae supplements sold that turned out to be toxic.', 'Therefore,
    consumers of such supplements should assure themselves of the reputability of
    the manufacturer.', 'Since seaweeds have varying amounts of iodine and other nutrients,
    it can be difficult to know how much is in any given supplement.', People with
    thyroid disorders may find that their conditions are made worse by eating kelp
    or taking seaweed supplements., 'Some seaweed also contains large amounts of sodium,
    which can worsen high blood pressure for those susceptible.', Below are links
    to recent studies concerning this food., 'For a more complete list, including
