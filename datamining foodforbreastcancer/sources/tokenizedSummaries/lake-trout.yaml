text: ['Lake trout, also known as lake char, is a fatty fish found primarily in U.S.
    and Canadian lakes such as the Great Lakes.', 'Lake trout is a good source of
    vitamin D, vitamin B6, selenium and omega-3 fatty acids, all of which have been
    associated with lower risk of certain cancers, including breast cancer.', Consumption
    of fatty fish or fish oil has been found to reduce the risk of coronary heart
    disease., 'Eating fatty fish such as lake trout has been found to be associated
    with reduced risks of leukemia, multiple myeloma, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, as
    well as renal cell, endometrial and prostate cancer.', 'Generally speaking, the
    benefits of consuming fatty fish, including lake trout, are thought to outweigh
    the potentially detrimental effects of the toxins from pollution and other sources
    that tend to accumulate in their adipose tissue.', 'Lake trout is not considered
    a high mercury fish, although relatively high levels have been recorded in lake
    trout from some Canadian lakes.', 'Depending on its location, lake trout can accumulate
    levels of polychlorinated biphenyls  and other contaminants high enough to be
    detrimental to human health.', 'Exposure to PCBs has been associated with increased
    risk of developing breast, prostate, testicular, ovarian and endometrial cancers.',
  'Like other fatty fish, lake trout is a significant source of the marine omega-3
    fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid  and docosahexaenoic acid.', These fatty acids
    have been shown to inhibit proliferation of breast cancer cells in the laboratory.,
  Fish protein hydrolysates also have been shown to have antiproliferative activity
    against human breast cancer cell lines., 'Most, but not all, epidemiological studies
    have found convincing evidence of a negative association between DHA and EPA intake
    or fatty fish consumption and the risk of breast cancer.', 'In addition, several
    studies have found that higher dietary omega-3 to omega-6 fatty acid intakes are
    associated with reduced risk of breast cancer; consuming lake trout would tend
    to improve this ratio for most women.', Marine fatty acids have also been found
    to enhance the therapeutic effects of tamoxifen and chemotherapy drugs such as
    Adriamycin and Taxol., 'However, note that recent research suggests that lake
    trout and similar fish should not be consumed the day before through the day after
    a chemotherapy treatment and consumed only in moderation during the remaining
    days of each cycle.', Fish similar to lake trout have been shown to incorporate
    a fatty acid  that can induce resistance to a broad spectrum of chemotherapy drugs.,
  'Lake trout should not be confused with rainbow trout, which is one of the most
    common farmed fish and does not have the same favorable omega-3 fatty acid profile.',
  Pan frying fatty fish has been shown to release carcinogenic heterocyclic amines  in
    concentrations high enough to affect human health., Population studies have also
    found that consumption of fried fish is associated with increased risk of breast
    cancer., 'While the situation has improved in recent years, the Great Lakes are
    contaminated with many pollutants, including PCBs, polychlorinated dibenzo dioxins
    and furans, polybrominated diphenyl ethers, and mercury, as well as chlorinated
    pesticides such as dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane  and its metabolites.', 'As
    a large predatory fish at the top of its food chain, lake trout tends to accumulate
    PCBs and other environmental contaminants.', The U.S. Environmental Protection
    Agency and Environment Canada perform ongoing monitoring of whole-body contaminant
    levels of top predator fish such as lake trout., 'Generally speaking, women can
    safely eat up to eight servings of lake trout per month.', 'However, lake trout
    should be avoided by pregnant women and nursing mothers due to its contaminant
    content.', Removing the skin from lake trout is recommended to reduce the level
    of contaminants ingested., Below are links to recent studies concerning this food.,
