text: ['Pomegranates are a good source of important polyphenols, including ellagic
    acid, punicic acid, ursolic acid, luteolin, delphinidin, and several anthocyanins.',
  Pomegranates are also a good dietary source of the lignan enterolactone., 'Pomegranates
    have been shown to suppress inflammation and joint damage in rheumatoid arthritis,
    improve hypertension and heart disease, reduce cholesterol, protect against UVB-induced
    damage to human skin, protect the brain, and improve sperm quality in rats.',
  'In addition, pomegranates have been shown to inhibit prostate cancer growth in
    mice, retard pancreatic cancer cell growth, and inhibit the proliferation of human
    oral, colon and lung cancer cells.', 'Pomegranates and pomegranate extracts have
    been shown to inhibit breast cancer cell proliferation and invasion and promote
    cell apoptosis in both estrogen receptor positive  and negative ER- breast cancer
    cells in a dose dependent manner, as well as preventing mammary tumor formation
    in HER2/neu transgenic mice.', 'Pomegranate seed oil, fermented pomegranate juice
    polyphenols, and ellagic acid have all been shown to inhibit angiogenesis in breast
    cancer cells.', Pomegranate fermented juice polyphenols and pomegranate seed oil
    have also been shown to reduce the number of carcinogen-induced mammary tumors
    in mice., 'In addition, pomegranates have been shown to inhibit aromatase activity.',
  Pomegranate juice has been shown to inhibit metastatic processes in breast cancer
    cells., 'Both pomegranate juice and the combination of luteolin, ellagic acid
    and punicic acid stimulated the expression of genes that increase breast cancer
    cell adhesion, as well as inhibiting genes that stimulate cell migration and inhibit
    breast cancer cells movement to the bone in one study.', 'In addition, the treatments
    reduced pro-inflammatory compounds, which implies that they could reduce inflammation
    and its promotion of cancer progression.', Pomegranates would appear to be an
    ideal chemopreventative agent against breast cancer were it not for the fact that
    pomegranates  are a significant source of a wide variety of phytoestrogens., 'While
    pomegranate juice is beneficial, its estrogenic components may make pomegranate
    harmful at concentrated dosages  and we do not know the levels or conditions under
    which this might be true.', 'The safety and efficacy of consumption of large amounts
    of pomegranate juice, pomegranate seed oil and pomegranate extract needs to be
    confirmed in large scale clinical trials.', 'Therefore, we conclude that breast
    cancer patients, survivors and those at high risk can enjoy pomegranates and pomegranate
    juice in moderation, but should avoid enhanced pomegranate juice, pomegranate
    seed oil and pomegranate extracts.', 'Earlier studies suggested that, like grapefruit
    juice, pomegranate juice could affect the metabolism of certain drugs.', 'However,
    it has since been demonstrated that pomegranate juice does not generally interfere
    with oral or intravenous medication.', Below are links to recent studies concerning
    this food., 'For a more complete list, including less recent studies, please click
