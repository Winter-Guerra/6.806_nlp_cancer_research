text: [Soybean paste is a type of fermented bean paste widely used in Asian cuisine.,
  Soybean paste normally is salty and may also be spicy., 'The soybeans may be roasted
    or aged before being ground to make the paste and various other ingredients such
    as wheat flour, sugar or hot pepper paste may be incorporated into the paste.',
  The conditions of fermentation and microflora used in production also affect the
    flavor., Soybean paste is used as a condiment to flavor dishes such as stir-fries
    and soups., Miso is a fermented soybean paste widely used in Japan as a soup base
    or for seasoning., 'This web page focuses on soybean paste; tofu, soybean oil,
    soy protein isolate and soybeans are covered in separate web pages.', We attempt
    to untangle the conflicting findings regarding breast cancer risk and soybean
    isoflavones in the genistein and daidzein web page., Soybean paste contains higher
    levels of genistein and daidzein than soybeans and extracts of soybean paste have
    been shown to have antimutagenic activities., 'However, whereas some Asian population
    studies have found reductions in breast cancer risk associated with consumption
    of other soy products such as tofu, such a reduction in risk usually is not found
    for soybean paste.', 'On the other hand, Asian studies have consistently found
    that frequent consumption of soybean paste is associated with higher risk of gastric
    cancer.', Stomach cancer is the most prevalent cancer in Korea and it is also
    common in other parts of Asia compared to the U.S., Some observers have suggested
    that the association between soybean paste and gastric cancer is mainly due to
    its high salt content., There is some evidence that breast cancer survivors are
    at increased risk of developing stomach cancer and lobular breast cancer survivors
    in particular are vulnerable to gastric metastases., 'However, the effect of consuming
    soybean paste are likely to be minimal if not part of a high-salt diet; it may
    be that regularly eating small amounts of soybean paste  in a diet that contains
    few other traditional fermented, salted or pickled foods might have little carcinogenic
    effect compared to eating it as part of a traditional Asian diet.', 'Based on
    the available evidence, soybean paste should not be considered protective against
    breast cancer and consuming much of it could heighten gastric cancer risk.', Soybean
    paste was found to be a meaningful source of aflatoxin B1 in the Koran diet in
    one study., 'Aflatoxins, which are mutagenic, carcinogenic and teratogenic and
    cause immuno-suppression in humans, are produced by molds.', 'Aflatoxin B1 has
    been shown to cause liver cancer, especially in hepatitis B-positive individuals.',
  Buyers of soybean paste should be aware of its source and assure themselves of its
    safety and quality., 'Note that while we are continually searching for new evidence
    concerning soybean paste, there is not much interest in it among cancer researchers
    so few recent studies are available.']
