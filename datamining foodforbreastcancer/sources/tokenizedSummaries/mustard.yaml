text: ['Like horseradish sauce, mustard is made from a brassica vegetable.', 'The
    yellow mustard commonly used in the U.S. is made from the ground seeds of the
    white or yellow mustard plant, which are mixed into a paste with water, vinegar,
    turmeric and other spices or flavorings.', Mustard is also made from brown or
    Indian mustard  seeds or black mustard  seeds., Brown and French-style mustards
    typically are made with Indian mustard seeds., 'Mustard greens, which are the
    leaves of Indian mustard, are covered in a separate web page.', 'Biologically
    active compounds in various mustards include allyl isothiocyanate, alpha-linolenic
    acid, sinalbin, sinigrin, gallic acid, protocatechuic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid,
    vanillic acid, caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid, ferulic acid, and sinapic acid.',
  'Components of mustard have been shown to have antimutagenic, antidiabetic, antifungal,
    antimicrobial and antioxidant effects.', White mustard seed has been shown to
    inhibit colon cancer formation when added to the diets of both normal and obese
    rats., 'Brassica compestris, another mustard grown in India, has been shown to
    inhibit the formation of carcinogen-induced stomach and uterine cancer in mice.',
  'Cruciferous vegetables have also been shown to reduce the risk of gallbladder and
    urinary bladder cancer and to inhibit the proliferation of lung, pancreatic, and
    prostate cancer cells.', 'While one carefully designed study of Chinese women
    found that brassica vegetable consumption was associated with significantly reduced
    breast cancer risk, population studies specifically evaluating the impact of consuming
    mustard seed are not available.', White and black mustard seeds are an excellent
    source of melatonin., 'Melatonin protects against breast cancer in several ways,
    including by reducing aromatase activity within the breast, thereby reducing estrogen
    production.', Indian mustard is known for its tendency to incorporate heavy metals
    and other minerals  from its soil., This property has been used to develop a high-selenium
    mustard  for use in combating prostate and other cancers., 'However, it also means
    that pollution resulting in heavy metal contamination of soil will result in the
    accumulation of high concentrations of such substances in locally grown mustard,
    with potentially harmful health effects.', 'Heavy metal contamination of agricultural
    soils and stream sediments have been reported in many countries, including China
    near coal and copper mines, in India near tanneries, and in Russia near uranium
    plants and heavy metal smelting complexes.', 'Much of the foreign Indian mustard
    consumed in the U.S. is imported from Canada, but it is also imported from parts
    of the old Soviet Union, India and China.', Buyers of Indian or black mustard
    from specialty markets should be aware of its source and assure themselves of
    its safety and quality., 'Although it is used widely in Indian cooking, depending
    on the mustard seed from which it is prepared, mustard oil  can be hazardous to
    health because of its relatively high content of erucic acid and allyl isothiocyanate.',
  'In addition, mustard oil adulteration  has occasionally been reported in India.',
  'Mustard oil has been shown to cause early carcinogenic changes in rat livers, especially
    when consumed after the oil has been heated to the boiling point.', The FDA has
    not approved mustard oil for human consumption., We do not recommend using it.,
  'Mustard oil should not be confused with mustard essential oil  which is produced
    by grinding the seeds, adding water, and extracting the resulting volatile oil
    by distillation.', The high allyl isothiocyanate content of mustard essential
    oil makes it frankly toxic when used undiluted., Below are links to recent studies
    concerning this food., 'For a more complete list of studies, please click on mustard.']
