text: [Tofu  is produced by coagulating soy milk and forming the curds into blocks.,
  'Soy milk is made by soaking dried soybeans and then grinding, boiling and straining
    them.', 'Various coagulants are used, typically salts.', A significant percentage
    of the original soybean isoflavones are lost in the production of tofu; using
    calcium sulfate as the coagulant has been found to maximize the retention of isoflavones.,
  'Tofu is a source of dietary protein, iron, choline, and the phytoestrogens genistein,
    genistin, daidzein, and daidzin.', Tofu may also be high in calcium or magnesium
    depending on the coagulant used., The firmness of tofu depends on its moisture
    content., Tofu can also be fermented  or flavored., 'Consumption of tofu has been
    found to be associated with lower risks of gastric, colorectal and prostate cancer.',
  Our conclusion that eating tofu could be beneficial is based on the available epidemiological
    evidence concerning tofu consumption and breast cancer incidence., 'Separate web
    pages cover soybean paste, soybean oil, soy protein isolate and soybeans.', We
    attempt to untangle the conflicting findings concerning soybeans and their component
    phytoestrogens and breast cancer in the genistein and daidzein web page., 'Population
    studies have found that high tofu intake is associated with lower risk of breast
    cancer, especially for pre-menopausal women.', Childhood consumption of tofu appears
    to enhance the protective effect of tofu in premenopausal women., 'Most of the
    studies concerning tofu consumption and risk of breast cancer have been conducted
    among Asian or Asian-American women, raising the possibility that tofu consumption
    is a marker for other protective aspects of Asian diets or lifestyles.', 'However,
    one North American study not focused on soyfoods or Asian cases found tofu consumption
    to be associated with lower risk of premenopausal bilateral breast cancer.', 'Tofu
    should be avoided during radiation treatment because genistein has been shown
    to protect cells against cell death caused by radiation damage, raising the possibility
    that consuming tofu will lessen the cytotoxic impact of radiation on breast cancer
    cells.', 'Tofu consumption has been found to be associated with lower serum levels
    of dioxin-like compounds in elderly Taiwanese, suggesting a protective mechanism
    of action.', There has also been some controversial research suggesting that long-term
    tofu consumption is associated with impaired cognitive function in older men.,
