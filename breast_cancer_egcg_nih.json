The present study tests the hypothesis that EGCG can inhibit the activation of HIF-1\u03b1 and NF\u03baB, and VEGF expression, thereby suppressing tumor angiogenesis and breast cancer progression. Sixteen eight-wk-old female mice (C57BL/6\u2009J) were inoculated with 10^6 E0771 (mouse breast cancer) cells in the left fourth mammary gland fat pad. Eight mice received EGCG at 50-100\u2009mg/kg/d in drinking water for 4\u2009weeks. 8 control mice received drinking water only. Tumor size was monitored using dial calipers. At the end of the experiment, blood samples, tumors, heart and limb muscles were collected for measuring VEGF expression using ELISA and capillary density (CD) using CD31 immunohistochemistry. EGCG treatment significantly reduced tumor weight over the control (0.37\u2009\u00b1\u20090.15 vs. 1.16\u2009\u00b1\u20090.30\u2009g; P\u2009<\u20090.01), tumor CD (109\u2009\u00b1\u200920 vs. 156\u2009\u00b1\u200912 capillary #/mm^2; P\u2009<\u20090.01), tumor VEGF expression (45.72\u2009\u00b1\u20091.4 vs. 59.03\u2009\u00b1\u20093.8\u2009pg/mg; P\u2009<\u20090.01), respectively. But, it has no effects on the body weight, heart weight, angiogenesis and VEGF expression in the heart and skeletal muscle of mice. EGCG at 50\u2009\u03bcg/ml significantly inhibited the activation of HIF-1\u03b1 and NF\u03baB as well as VEGF expression in cultured E0771 cells, compared to the control, respectively. These findings support the hypothesis that EGCG, a major green tea catechin, directly targets both tumor cells and tumor vasculature, thereby inhibiting tumor growth, proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis of breast cancer, which is mediated by the inhibition of HIF-1\u03b1 and NF\u03baB activation as well as VEGF expression.",

Dietary components that are capable of inhibiting the growth of cancer cells without affecting the growth of normal cells are receiving considerable attention in developing novel cancer-preventive approaches. Studies have shown that (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) from green tea imparts a growth inhibitory effect on cancer cells. Here, we show that treatment of EGCG dose-dependently inhibited (20-100%) the reproductive or colony forming potential, and also decreased cell viability at different time points studied ( approximately 80% inhibition) in human breast carcinoma MCF-7 cells but had no adverse effect on the growth of normal mammary cells. Treatment of EGCG for 48 and 72 h markedly increased the percentage of apoptotic cells (32-51%) in MCF-7 cells compared to that of non-EGCG treated cells (8-14%). In order to identify the possible mechanism of decreased cell viability and induction of apoptosis in breast carcinoma cells by EGCG, we found that treatment of MCF-7 cells with EGCG dose-dependently inhibited telomerase activity (40-55%), and also inhibited the mRNA expression (40-55%) of hTERT, a catalytic subunit of telomerase. Additional studies demonstrated that EGCG also inhibited the protein expression of hTERT, which indicated that inhibition of telomerase was associated with down-regulation of hTERT. Together, our results indicate that EGCG down-regulates telomerase in human breast carcinoma MCF-7 cells, leading to the suppression of cell viability and induction of apoptosis, thus providing the molecular basis for the development of EGCG as a novel chemopreventive and pharmacologically safe agent against breast cancer.",

Lipogenesis is regulated by the enzyme fatty acid synthase (FASN); and breakdown of fatty acids is regulated by carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 (CPT-I). FASN is highly expressed in breast cancer and most common human carcinomas. Several compounds can inhibit FASN, although the degree of specificity of this inhibition has not been addressed. We have tested the effects of C75 and (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) on fatty acid metabolism pathways, cellular proliferation, induction of apoptosis and cell signalling in human breast cancer cells. Our results show that C75 and EGCG had comparable effects in blocking FASN activity. Treating cancer cells with EGCG or C75 induced apoptosis and caused a decrease in the active forms of oncoprotein HER2, AKT and ERK1/2 to a similar degree. We observed, in contrast, marked differential effects between C75 and EGCG on the fatty acid oxidation pathway. While EGCG had either no effect or a moderate reduction in CPT-I activity, C75 stimulated CPT-I activity (up to 129%), even in presence of inhibitory levels of malonyl-CoA, a potent inhibitor of the CPT-I enzyme. Taken together, these findings indicate that pharmacological inhibition of FASN occurs uncoupled from the stimulation of CPT-I with EGCG but not with C75, suggesting that EGCG might be free of the CPT-I related in vivo weight-loss that has been associated with C75. Our results establish EGCG as a potent and specific inhibitor of fatty acid synthesis (FASN), which may hold promise as a target-directed anti-cancer drug.",

Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) is the major biologically active component of green tea. In this study we evaluated the cell proliferation and relative gene expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression on Hs578T human breast cancer cell line at 24, 48 and 72 hours after 10 microM of EGCG treatment. Also, we evaluated the effect of this natural compound on the cell migratory behaviour based on real-time XCELLigence data. Cell proliferation becomes significantly low at 72 hours. EGCG had a dual effect on the VEGF gene expression timeline: after a first increase at 24 hours, it started to decrease at 48 and 72 hours. The inhibition of cell proliferation at 72 hours suggests a possible reactivation of apoptosis. The dual effect on VEGF expression in the presence of EGCG suggests the complexity of the angiogenic switch leading to the modulation of the cell migration processes. It also emphasizes the importance of the metabolite products in the modulation of these effects. Our findings have shown that EGCG suppresses the growth, migration and invasion of human breast cancer cells by inhibiting VEGF expression. A better understanding of this mechanism may lead to an improved strategy for tumor therapy based on the inhibition of angiogenesis.",

Known risk factors, such as genetic modifications, have been estimated to account for approximately 5 to 10% of breast cancer cases, and these tend to be early onset. Thus, exposure to and bioaccumulation of ubiquitous environmental chemicals, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), have been proposed to play a role in this increased incidence. Treatment of female Sprague-Dawley rats with a single dose of the PAH 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) induces mammary tumors in approximately 90 to 95% of test animals. We showed previously that female rats treated with DMBA and given green tea as drinking fluid displayed significantly decreased mammary tumor burden and invasiveness and a significantly increased latency to first tumor. Here we used cDNA microarray analysis to elucidate the effects of the green tea polyphenol epigallocatechin-3 gallate (EGCG) on the gene expression profile in a DMBA-transformed breast cancer cell line. RNA was isolated, in quadruplicate, from D3-1 cells treated with 60 mug/mL EGCG for 2, 7, or 24 h and subjected to analysis. Semiquantitative RT-PCR and Northern blot analyses confirmed the changes in the expression of 12 representative genes seen in the microarray experiments. Overall, our results documented EGCG-altered expression of genes involved in nuclear and cytoplasmic transport, transformation, redox signaling, response to hypoxia, and PAHs.",

As regular green tea consumption has been associated with improved prognosis of breast cancer patients, including decreased risk of recurrence, here the effects of the green tea polyphenol epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) were tested on two IBC lines: SUM-149 and SUM-190. EGCG decreased expression of genes that promote proliferation, migration, invasion, and survival. Consistently, growth, invasive properties, and survival of IBC cells were reduced by EGCG treatment. EGCG also reduced lymphangiogenesis-promoting genes, in particular VEGF-D. Conditioned media from EGCG-treated IBC cells displayed decreased VEGF-D secretion and reduced ability to promote lymphangiogenesis in vitro as measured by hTERT-HDLEC lymphatic endothelial cell migration and tube formation. Tumorsphere formation by SUM-149 cells was robustly inhibited by EGCG, suggesting effects on self-renewal ability. Stem-like SUM-149 cells with high aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity, previously implicated in poor patient prognosis, were isolated. EGCG treatment reduced growth and induced apoptosis of the stem-like SUM-149 cells in culture. In an orthotopic mouse model, EGCG decreased growth of pre-existing tumors derived from ALDH-positive stem-like SUM-149 cells and their expression of VEGF-D, which correlated with a significant decrease in peritumoral lymphatic vessel density. Thus, EGCG inhibits the overall aggressive IBC phenotype. Reduction of the stem-like cell compartment by EGCG may explain the decreased risk of breast cancer recurrence among green tea drinkers. Recent clinical trials demonstrate the efficacy of green tea polyphenol extracts in treatment of prostate cancer and lymphocytic leukemia with low toxicity. Given the poor prognosis of IBC patients, our findings suggest further exploration of EGCG or green tea in combinatorial treatments against active IBC disease or in maintenance regimens to avoid recurrence is warranted.",

We have investigated the cell growth inhibitory effects of EGCG on cell growth of the human breast cancer cell line MCF-7, and the mechanism of its action with emphasis on the regulation of tumor cell survival. A significant EGCG dose-dependent growth inhibition was observed coordinated with EGCG-induced apoptosis. Analysis of survivin expression after addition of EGCG showed that both survivin mRNA and protein were decreased. The survivin-promoter luciferase activity in EGCG-treated cells was significantly inhibited by 91+/-2.0% (P<0.001), compared with the control. Interestingly, EGCG strongly inhibited the basal activation of phospho-AKT and AKT kinase activity as early as 30 min after treatment. Furthermore, inhibition of AKT kinase activity by EGCG preceded the suppression of survivin (1 h post treatment), followed by increased caspase-9 activity (6 h post treatment). A dominant negative AKT or the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor, LY294002, also strongly inhibited survivin promoter activity, providing further evidence to support the hypothesis that the inhibitory effect of EGCG on survivin is mediated via the AKT pathway. Therefore, EGCG is a potent proapoptotic agent in MCF-7 breast cancer cells that targets survivin expression via suppression of the AKT pathway.",

EGCG overcame paclitaxel-induced GRP78 expression and potentiated paclitaxel-induced JNK phosphorylation in 4T1 cells both in vitro and in vivo.",

Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family of proteinases that catalyses the destruction of ECM, among which MMP-9 has important role in tumor cell invasion. Secretion of MMP-9 is stimulated by a variety of factors, EGFR being significant. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) is a major polyphenol of green tea that inhibits cell proliferation and invasion. Here, we study the effect of EGFR alone and in collaboration with fibronectin on the status of MMP-9 in human breast cancer cell MDA-MB-231 and its molecular mechanism; study the role of EGCG on the induced MMP-9; and elucidate the signaling molecules involved in the process.",
