[Green tea contains catechins and other polyphenols that are thought to be responsible
    for its anti-cancer properties., 'Important green tea polyphenols include epigallocatechin-3-gallate
    (EGCG), epicatechin, epigallocatechin, and epicatechin-3-gallate.', EGCG has been
    shown to inhibit tumor growth and angiogenesis of estrogen receptor positive (ER+)
    breast cancer in mice without affecting normal tissue growth., 'EGCG also has
    been found to inhibit growth and induce apoptosis of HER2/neu overexpressing (HER2+)
    breast cancer cells, including those resistant to Herceptin.', Green tea polyphenols
    have been found to inhibit the transformation of normal breast cells into breast
    cancer cells in a laboratory model of carcinogenesis induced by long-term exposure
    to low levels of environmental carcinogens., 'In addition, EGCG has been shown
    to reduce the growth and induce apoptosis of the stem-like inflammatory breast
    cancer (IBC) cells.', 'EGCG has been shown to synergistically enhance the growth
    inhibition of ER+ cells by tamoxifen and Taxol (paclitaxel), thereby increasing
    the effectiveness of such therapy.', 'In addition, green tea extract has been
    found to protect against tamoxifen-induced liver injury in rats.', Green tea intake
    has been found to enhance the inhibitory effects of Adriamycin (doxorubicin) in
    Ehrlich ascites carcinoma tumor-bearing mice and in ovarian cancer cells., Green
    tea polyphenols have been shown to have potentiating effect on cisplatin chemotherapy
    in a mouse cervical cancer model (cisplatin is sometimes used to treat triple
    negative (ER-/PR-/HER2-) breast cancer)., The kaempferol content of green tea
    might help protect against Adriamycin-induced heart damage., 'However, green tea
    might reduce the effectiveness of Adriamycin and other anthracycline chemotherapy
    due to its caffeine content.', Numerous population studies have found that heavy
    green tea consumption is associated with lower risk of breast cancer., There is
    also some evidence that green tea consumption might help prevent recurrence in
    early stage (stages I and II) breast cancers.]
