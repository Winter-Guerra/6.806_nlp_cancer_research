['Red grapes and grape seeds are a good source of resveratrol, which has the ability
    to suppress proliferation of breast cancer cells and promote cell death.', 'Resveratrol
    also can inhibit aromatase (the synthesis of estrogen from androgens within the
    body), which is important for reducing growth-stimulatory effects in estrogen-dependent
    breast cancer.', Other grape polyphenols such as quercetin and catechin have also
    been shown to have chemopreventive effects and appear to act synergistically with
    resveratrol in inhibiting breast cancer growth., Several population studies have
    reported that grape consumption is associated with reduced risk of breast cancer.,
  Resveratrol has also been shown to increase the effects of radiation treatment and
    the chemotherapy drug Taxol (paclitaxel) against breast cancer.]
