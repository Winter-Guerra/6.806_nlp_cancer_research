[Most of the population-based breast cancer studies performed to date that specifically
    included pumpkins were conducted in Japan (since pumpkin consumption is higher
    there than in the U.S. or Europe)., 'One Japanese study found that consuming vegetables
    (specifically including pumpkins) reduced the risk of gastric, breast, lung and
    colorectal cancer, regardless of the family history of cancer.', 'Another Japanese
    study found reductions in breast cancer risk associated with high intakes of green-yellow
    vegetables (green leafy vegetables, carrots and pumpkins) among both premenopausal
    and postmenopausal women.']
