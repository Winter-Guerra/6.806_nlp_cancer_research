[Ginger refers to the fresh or dried rhizome (underground stem) of the ginger plant
    (Zingiber officinale)., 'Ginger contains numerous compounds that have been shown
    to have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antiviral, antifungal,
    anti-arthritic, hypotensive, antiatherogenic, radioprotective and antiemetic properties.',
  Ginger is believed to affect serotonin receptors in the digestive tract and it has
    been traditionally used to aid digestion and treat stomach upset and nausea (including
    pregnancy-related "morning sickness")., Ginger may assist in prevention of the
    progression of type 2 diabetes through its hypoglycemic effects and by increasing
    insulin sensitivity., "Ginger also contains components shown to have anti-cancer\
    \ effects, including various gingerols, shogaols, paradols, as well as \u03B2\
    -elemene, gingerdione and zingerone.", 'Ginger has been shown to have protective
    effect in cell and animal prostate cancer models and to suppress colorectal, skin
    and lung carcinogenesis in laboratory animals.', 'Ginger has also been shown to
    inhibit the growth of leukemia cells, as well as gastric, pancreatic, liver and
    ovarian cancer cells in the laboratory.', Ginger has been found to significantly
    inhibit mammary tumorigenesis and tumor growth in laboratory mice when fed in
    drinking water., 'Ginger components 6-Shogaol and [6]-gingerol have been shown
    to inhibit cell adhesion, invasion, and motility in both hormone receptor positive
    (ER+/PR+) and triple negative (ER-/PR-/HER2-) human breast cancer cells in the
    laboratory.', 'Ginger has been found to be effective in treating chemotherapy-induced
    nausea and vomiting, although not all studies agree.', The key appears to be to
    take the ginger _before_ undergoing a chemotherapy treatment as well as afterwards.,
  'However, it has not been determined whether this reduction in gastrointestinal
    symptoms is accompanied by a reduction in the effectiveness of chemotherapy.',
  'Until more research establishes the safety of using ginger during chemotherapy,
    we do not recommend it.', 'On the other hand, ginger should be avoided during
    radiation treatment since it has been shown to help protect cells against the
    cytotoxic effects of radiation.', 'Edible tropical ginger (Zingiber zerumbet Smith),
    also known as subtropical ginger, contains compounds such as zerumbone and 1''-acetoxychavicol
    acetate, which have been shown to have anti-breast cancer effects in the laboratory.',
  'However, note that this ginger is typically not sold in the U.S. and many "tropical
    gingers" are inedible ornamental plants.', 'Wild ginger (Asarum canadense), which
    is used in some weight loss and Chinese herbal preparations, should be avoided.',
  'Wild ginger incorporates aristolochic acid, which has been shown to be toxic to
    the kidneys and is a suspected human carcinogen.', 'Ginger ale or ginger beer
    is a soft drink that, as formulated commercially in the U.S., typically contains
    high amounts of sugar and low or nonexistent amounts of ginger.', 'For example
    Canada Dry regular ginger ale contains the following ingredients: carbonated water,
    high fructose syrup and/or sugar, citric acid, natural flavors, sodium benzoate
    and caramel color.', _Below are links to recent studies concerning this food.,
