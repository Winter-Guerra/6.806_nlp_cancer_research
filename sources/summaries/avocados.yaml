[Avocados (Persea americana) generally are considered a healthy food; the high fat
    content of avocados typically is the only reason given for limiting consumption
    of this fruit., 'Avocados are a good source of monounsaturated fats, folate, vitamin
    B6, various carotenoids such as lutein and beta-carotene, and various chlorophylls.',
  'Avocados have been shown to protect the liver, improve cholesterol, and ameliorate
    osteoarthritis symptoms.', 'Avocado extract has been shown to have chemopreventive
    effects on human oral premalignant and malignant cells, as well as inhibiting
    the growth of both androgen-dependent and androgen-independent prostate cancer
    cell lines in the laboratory.', 'Avocados are a rich source of cytochrome P-450s,
    enzymes involved in drug metabolism and estrogen metabolism, the implications
    of which for breast cancer have not been established.', One study found that a
    diet high in avocado oil promoted the formation of mammary tumors in rats., Another
    study of postmenopausal U.S. Latina women found that consumption of avocados was
    associated with higher circulating estrogen levels., 'On the other hand, a toxin
    in avocado leaves has been shown to enhance the cytotoxic effects of tamoxifen
    on human breast cancer cells regardless of their estrogen receptor (ER) status.',
  'Based on the available evidence, breast cancer patients, survivors and those at
    high risk should limit consumption of avocados until further studies clarify these
    findings.', 'Lactating animals that gain access to avocado leaves or fruit have
    been known to develop a type of noninfectious mastitis, with a marked decrease
    in milk production, and milk characterized by cheesy consistency and clots.',
  This has been shown to be accompanied by pathological changes in the mammary gland.,
  'Avocado fruit and leaves have been shown to be toxic to various bird species, dogs,
    goats, and horses.', Up to half of people with a significant latex allergies will
    develop cross-reactivity to avocados., We are aware that this is a favorite "healthy"
    food for many and are making an extra effort to find new studies as they become
    available., 'However, there is not much interest in avocados among cancer researchers,
    so few truly relevant studies are available.', _Below are links to recent studies
    concerning this food., 'For a more complete list of studies, please click on avocados._']
