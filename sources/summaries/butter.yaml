['Although not all studies of the relationship between breast cancer and dairy foods
    have found a positive association between butter intake and the risk of breast
    cancer, many have.', Women in the Nurses' Health Study who consumed more butter
    during high school have been found to have a higher risk of breast cancer in adulthood.,
  'Another study found that butter consumption was associated with increased risk
    of recurrence of early stage breast cancer, especially among premenopausal breast
    cancer cases.', 'Other U.S, Canadian and European studies have found the use of
    butter in soups or sauces (i.e., boiled butter), butter at the dinner table, and
    butter used for frying food to be associated with higher risk of breast cancer.',
  'High intake of animal fats has been linked in several studies to increased breast
    density, a risk factor for breast cancer and recurrence.']
