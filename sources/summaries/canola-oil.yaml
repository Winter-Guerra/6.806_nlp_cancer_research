[Canola oil has been shown to inhibit growth and induce apoptosis in both estrogen
    positive (ER+) and estrogen negative (ER-) human breast cancer cells., 'Female
    mammary gland cancer-prone rats consuming canola oil during pregnancy have been
    found to produce offspring with lower tumor numbers, lower tumor volume and lower
    percentage of mice with tumors than the offspring of mothers on a diet with equivalent
    amounts of corn oil.', Several studies have found that higher omega-3/omega-6
    fatty acid ratios are associated with reduced risk of breast cancer; using canola
    oil would tend to improve the ratio for most women., A 2008 San Francisco population
    study found that women cooking mainly with olive/canola oil have a lower risk
    of breast cancer than those cooking with vegetable/corn oil or hydrogenated fats.]
