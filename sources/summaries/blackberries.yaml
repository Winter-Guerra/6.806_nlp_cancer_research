['The evidence that blackberries could be beneficial in fighting breast cancer is
    derived in part from studies of other berries, as well as of blackberries in particular.',
  'Blackberries contain cyandin-3-glucoside, lignans, ellagic acid, the flavonoid
    myricetin and other potentially beneficial substances.', Cyandin-3-glucoside has
    been shown to possess both chemo preventive and chemotherapeutic activity., Postmenopausal
    women with breast cancer and a high intake of plant lignans have been found to
    be less likely to die from their breast cancer than those with a low intake.,
  Ellagic acid has been shown to inhibit cancer formation., Myricetin has antioxidant
    properties., The combination of chemicals in blackberries may more effectively
    prevent cancer than any one of the component chemicals alone., Blackberries contain
    relatively high levels of phytoestrogens (in the form of lignans such as enterolactane)
    compared to other berries., Marionberries are a type of blackberry (a cultivar
    cross between Chehalem blackberries and Olallie blackberries)., Loganberries are
    a hybrid cross between between a blackberry and a raspberry., _Below are links
    to recent studies concerning this food., 'For a more complete list of studies,
