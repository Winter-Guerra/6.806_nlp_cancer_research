[Consumption of carrots has been found to be associated with reduced risk of breast
    cancer in numerous (but not all) population studies., 'This protective effect
    appears to be due to the interaction of multiple components of carrots, not just
    the presence of alpha-carotene and beta-carotene.', Higher levels of carotenoids
    and vitamin A (retinol) in the blood of breast cancer survivors have both been
    found to be associated with greater likelihood of breast cancer-free survival.]
