['Carrots have been shown to have antioxidant, antifungal, antibacterial, and anti-inflammatory
    effects.', 'Carrots are an excellent dietary source of vitamin A (converted in
    the body from beta-carotene and alpha-carotene) and fiber, and contains some vitamin
    C and B vitamins, as well as calcium, iron, magnesium, and manganese.', 'In addition
    to various carotenoids, carrots contain other bioactive compounds such as falcarinol,
    luteolin, sulfoquinovosyl diacylglycerol, and various lignans, all of which have
    been shown to have, or are suspected of having, anti-cancer activities.', 'Carrots
    have been shown to suppress inflammation, promote good vision and be cardioprotective.',
  'Consumption of carrots has been found to be associated with reduced risk of esophageal,
    lung, colon, bladder, urothelial, cervical, prostate, and ovarian cancer.', Consumption
    of carrots has been found to be associated with reduced risk of breast cancer
    in numerous (but not all) population studies., 'This protective effect appears
    to be due to the interaction of multiple components of carrots, not just the presence
    of alpha-carotene and beta-carotene.', Higher levels of carotenoids and vitamin
    A (retinol) in the blood of breast cancer survivors have both been found to be
    associated with greater likelihood of breast cancer-free survival., Consuming
    8 fluid ounces of fresh carrot juice per day has been shown to raise carotenoids
    in the blood to levels associated with protection against breast cancer., 'Supplementation
    with beta-carotene or with vitamin A will not provide the same beneficial effects
    as consuming high-carotenoid foods such as carrots and in fact these supplements
    have been associated with increased risk of certain cancers (e.g., lung cancer).',
  Non-organic carrots must be washed very thoroughly to remove pesticide residue.,
  The original carrots were purple in color and purple carrots are still available.,
  Purple carrots contain beneficial anthocyanins in addition to carotenoids., _Below
    are links to recent studies concerning this food., 'For a list of studies that
    includes less recent research, please click on carrots._']
