['Sunflower (Helianthus annuus) oil ranks fourth in world vegetable oil production,
    after palm oil, soybean oil and canola oil.', 'Sunflower oil (sunflower seed oil)
    is an abundant dietary source of unsaturated fat (primarily the polyunsaturated
    omega-6 fatty acid, linoleic acid), vitamin E, and some phenolic compounds.',
  'Unlike olive oil, canola oil or walnut oil, sunflower oil has not been found to
    be associated with health benefits such as reducing cardiovascular risk factors.',
  Nor has it been associated with any reductions in cancer risk in population studies.,
  The relationships between oil and fat consumption and breast cancer are complex
    and appear to depend on the specific attributes of the oil or fat in question.,
  'It was originally thought that consumption of fat promoted breast cancer, regardless
    of the source of the fat.', 'The focus then shifted to saturated versus unsaturated
    fat, with further refinements concerning monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) and
    polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs).', 'More recently, the emphasis has shifted
    to the balance between omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids in the diet.', The reason
    for these changes in emphasis is that none of the theories were found to hold
    consistently in population studies., 'While the theory that cancer is caused in
    part by an excess of omega-6 fatty acids in the Western diet appears to be valid,
    it is not a global explanation for the relationship between oils and fats and
    breast cancer.', 'For example, it does not explain the fact that olive oil, which
    does not have a high omega-3 content, is protective against breast cancer.', 'In
    the case of sunflower oil, there is evidence from experiments using either carcinogen-induced
    or transplanted animal mammary tumor models, as well as in vitro studies, which
    demonstrates that linoleic acid, the primary fatty acid in sunflower oil, promotes
    mammary tumor development.', "One study found that women with a specific genotype\
    \ (ALOX5AP \u22124900 A>G polymorphism) who consumed a significant amount of linoleic\
    \ acid in their diets had an increased risk of breast cancer.", Another study
    found increased breast cancer risk among women cooking primarily with vegetable
    or corn oil compared to women using olive or canola oil., Women with breast cancer
    have been found to have higher levels of omega-6 in their breast tissue than similar
    women without breast cancer., Several studies have found that lower dietary omega-6/omega-3
    ratios are associated with reduced risk of breast cancer., Consuming sunflower
    oil would tend to increase the ratio for most women because of its high omega-6
    content., It has been demonstrated that consumption of either olive oil or eicosapentaenoic
    acid (found in fish oil) improves absorption and metabolism of beta-carotene in
    food compared with linoleic acid., This could be important for reducing breast
    cancer risk since dietary carotenoids have been found to be associated with lower
    risk of breast cancer., Sunflower seeds have been shown to have antioxidant activities
    and are a very good source of melatonin and vitamin B6., 'Of the products typically
    consumed as snack foods, pistachio and sunflower kernel were found to be richest
    in phytosterols, according to one study.', 'However, sunflower seeds and kernels
    can contain high levels of the carcinogenic heavy metal cadmium, since sunflower
    plants have a tendency to accumulate cadmium.', Sunflower seeds grown for consumption
    as seeds are known as confectionary sunflower seeds., 'U.S. confectionary sunflower
    seeds are grown primarily in North and South Dakota, a region with relatively
    high cadmium levels in the soil.', Stricter European rules on cadmium in sunflower
    imports from the U.S. have caused confectionary sunflower seeds grown in U.S.
    soils with lower levels of cadmium to be diverted to the European market., 'Efforts
    have been under way for several years to breed sunflower hybrids that will take
    up less cadmium, however it is not clear to what extent U.S. consumers are benefiting
    from such efforts.', 'In addition, sunflower seeds also contains relatively high
    levels of copper, which has been shown to increase angiogenesis and metastasis
    of breast cancer.', _Below are links to recent studies concerning this food.,
