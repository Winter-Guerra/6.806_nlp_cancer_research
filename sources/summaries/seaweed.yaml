["The evidence that seaweed consumption could reduce the risk of breast cancer is\
    \ based primarily on studies of brown seaweeds:\n\n   Consumption of brown seaweeds\
    \ has been shown to favorably alter estrogen metabolism in women.", Extract of
    common kelp has been shown to inhibit the binding of estradiol to estrogen receptors
    and progesterone to the progesterone receptor., "Bladderwrack (another type of\
    \ edible kelp) has been found to exert anti-estrogenic effects in pre-menopausal\
    \ women\n   Specific unique components (fucoidan, fucoxanthin, alginic acid, laminarin)\
    \ of brown seaweeds have been shown to inhibit cancer cell proliferation.", "However,\
    \ red seaweeds, which lack these compounds, also inhibit proliferation, suggesting\
    \ that other compounds found in seaweed may also be important\n   Seaweed in the\
    \ Asian diet may enhance intestinal conversion of phytoestrogens, in particular\
    \ the production of equol, which could explain some of the breast cancer protective\
    \ effects of dietary seaweed and soy\n   The brown seaweed wakame (a type of kelp)\
    \ has been shown to contain the omega-3 fats eicosapentaenoic acid and stearidonic\
    \ acid, which may favorably increase the omega-3/omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty\
    \ acid ratio (which in turn is thought to reduce breast cancer risk).", "Some\
    \ other types of seaweed have been found to contain docosahexaenoic acid, another\
    \ marine omega-3 fat\n   Wakame was also found to reduce breast cancer proliferation\
    \ in rats in one Japanese study\n   Mekabu (wakame root) extract has been shown\
    \ to induce cell death in human hormone receptor negative (ER-/PR-) breast cancer\
    \ cells and to suppress mammary carcinogenesis in rats when administered in daily\
    \ drinking water, without toxicity\n   Various types of red, brown and green algae\
    \ have been found to be good sources of melatonin.", "Melatonin protects against\
    \ breast cancer in several ways, including by reducing aromatase activity within\
    \ the breast, thereby reducing estrogen production\n   The relatively high iodine\
    \ content of seaweed may contribute to reduction in risk of breast cancer\n  \
    \ The relatively high levels of calcium found in seaweed are also thought to contribute\
    \ to seaweed's chemopreventive effects, in combination with its other components.",
  'We suggest consuming seaweed as food rather than fucoidan, kelp or other seaweed
    supplements since (1) as outlined above, various components of seaweed in addition
    to fucoidan or iodine may be responsible for seaweed''s apparent anti-carcinogenic
    effects; (2) the compounds, minerals and fiber found in seaweed may act synergistically
    to reduce cancer risk; (3) safe and effective levels of fucoidan have not been
    established; (4) supplementation may result in increased blood thinning, depending
    on the formulation.']
