[Cherries contain substances that have been shown to be antiproliferative and antioxidant.,
  'While several studies have found that cherries might inhibit colon cancer, few
    studies have been performed that address the effects of consuming cherries on
    breast cancer.', 'Cherries contain relatively high levels of anthocyanins (flavonoids
    that give them their intense coloration), giving them antioxidant, anti-inflammatory
    and chemopreventative properties.', Cherry extracts have been shown to inhibit
    cancer cell proliferation., 'Generally speaking, sour cherries have higher concentrations
    of anthocyanins than sweet cherries.', Tart or sour cherries are also an important
    source of melatonin., 'Melatonin protects against breast cancer in several ways,
    including by reducing aromatase activity within the breast, thereby reducing estrogen
    production.', Non-organic cherries must be washed very thoroughly to remove pesticide
    residue., _Below are links to recent studies concerning this food., 'For a more
