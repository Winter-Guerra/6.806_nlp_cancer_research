['A number of studies have found an inverse association between breast cancer risk
    and increasing consumption of tomatoes, components of tomatoes, or vegetables
    that have high levels of carotenoids (including tomatoes).', "For example, one\
    \ study comprising 84,805 postmenopausal women in the Women's Health Initiative\
    \ Observational Study found that dietary \u03B1-carotene, \u03B2-carotene, and\
    \ lycopene were each found to be inversely associated with the risk of ER+/PR+\
    \ breast cancer.", 'Another study found that dietary carotenoids inhibit the cancer-promoting
    effects of both estradiol and genistein (the phytoestrogen found in soy), thereby
    reducing their harmful effect in hormone-dependent breast cancer.', 'Studies of
    naringenin, a tomato flavanone, have shown that it also inhibits ER+ breast cancer
    cell growth and migration in the presence of estradiol.', 'Delphinidin, an anthocyanin
    found in tomatoes, has been shown to block epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
    signaling in breast cancer cells (EGFR is expressed at high levels in at least
    30% of breast cancers and is associated with a poor prognosis).', 'However, one
    large study found no association between dietary or plasma lycopene levels and
    the risk of breast cancer in middle-aged and older women.', Several studies of
    early-stage breast cancer survivors have found that higher levels of cartenoids
    in the blood are associated with both lower risk of break cancer recurrence and
    lower risk of a new primary breast tumor., "Another study found that plasma levels\
    \ of retinol (a form of vitamin A that is a by-product of \u03B2-carotene in the\
    \ body) also are positively associated with breast cancer survival in postmenopausal\
    \ women.", 'As noted above, tomatoes are a good dietary source of melatonin.',
  'Melatonin protects against breast cancer in several ways, including by reducing
    aromatase activity within the breast, thereby reducing estrogen production.',
  Several studies have shown that the cardioprotective effect of tomatoes and lycopene
    extends to reducing the impact of myocardial toxicity from Adriamycin (doxorubicin)
    chemotherapy by ameliorating cardiac cell injury.]
