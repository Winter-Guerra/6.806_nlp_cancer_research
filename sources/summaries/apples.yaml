['One study found that the consumption of apples was inversely related to the risk
    of breast cancer when the results were adjusted for factors such as age, education,
    body mass index (BMI), alcohol consumption, total energy intake, vegetable consumption
    and physical activity.', Apples have been shown to shrink the size of mammary
    tumors in rats and to induce breast cancer cell apoptosis., Apple peel contains
    chemicals that may be important for this effect., One study reported that an apple
    peel diet significantly inhibited the growth of mammary tumors in a mouse model
    of breast cancer., The same study reported that a triterpenoid found in apple
    peel induced apoptosis (programmed cell death) in triple negative breast cancer
    cells., The apple flavonoid phloretin has been shown to increase the anti-cancer
    effects of the chemotherapy drug Taxol (paclitaxel).]
