['Lamb is a good dietary source of protein, zinc, selenium, B-vitamins and iron.',
  'Lamb also contains high levels of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) and stearate,
    both of which have been shown to induce breast cancer cell death.', 'However,
    the potentially favorable effects of these components appear to be overwhelmed
    by lamb''s high level of saturated fat and the carcinogenic effects of naturally-occurring
    lamb compounds, lamb additives and lamb preparation methods.', 'Diets high in
    red meat or well-done red meat have been linked in various population studies
    to higher risks of non-Hodgkin''s lymphoma and cancers of the oral cavity, throat,
    esophagus, lung, stomach, pancreas, liver, colon, rectum, endometrium and prostate.',
  Most population studies combine lamb with other red meat intake when evaluating
    the influence of lamb consumption on breast cancer risk and some groups of people
    seldom eat lamb., "The following studies specifically included lamb, either as\
    \ part of red meat consumption, or separately:\n\n   A prospective study that\
    \ was designed to investigate the relationship between post-diagnosis diet and\
    \ survival after breast cancer reported that women in the highest compared to\
    \ the lowest fifth of intake of saturated fat intake had a significantly higher\
    \ risk of dying from any cause.", 'Saturated fats are found primarily in meats
    and dairy foods (fatty beef, lamb, pork, poultry with skin, lard, whole milk,
    cream, butter, cheese) and baked and fried foods containing palm oil, palm kernel
    oil or coconut oil.', 'Results were similar for risk of dying specifically from
    breast cancer, however they did not reach statistical significance.', 'A Chinese
    retrospective case-control study designed to investigate the relationship between
    dietary patterns and risk of breast cancer found that a diet characterized by
    high consumption of vegetables, fruit, soy, milk, poultry, and fish and low consumption
    of refined grains, red meat, and pickles was associated with reduced risk of breast
    cancer.', A Uruguayan study which analyzed 39 food groups to determine association
    with ductal breast cancer reported that a dietary pattern that included lamb was
    associated with increased breast cancer risk., 'A study that included 52,158 postmenopausal
    women reported that, comparing the fifth to the first quintile, red meat, the
    heterocyclic amine (HCA) 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline, and dietary
    iron each were associated with increased risk of breast cancer.', Higher red meat
    consumption during adolescence by women in the Nurses' Health Study II has been
    found to be associated with increased risk of premenopausal breast cancer in adulthood.,
  A UK study found that both pre- and postmenopausal women who consumed the most meat
    (including red meat) had the highest risk of breast cancer., "A number of factors\
    \ may account for the findings of increased breast cancer risk:\n\n   The U.S.\
    \ lamb industry uses zeranol (Ralgro), a non-steroidal substance with estrogenic\
    \ activity, as a growth promoter.", Zeranol has been found to stimulate human
    breast cancer cell growth and proliferation., Other growth promoters (mostly hormones)
    that are routinely administered to lamb are also suspected to contribute to breast
    cancer risk., 'Irradiation of lamb, which is widespread in the U.S., has been
    found to result in the formation of alkylcyclobutanones, which have been shown
    to have mutagenic and tumor promoting activities.', 'Some of the HCAs formed in
    very well done lamb and in lamb drippings are known human carcinogens that have
    been shown to have potent estrogenic activity, inducing activation of estrogen-regulated
    genes, proliferation of estrogen-dependent cells and up-regulation of progesterone
    receptor.', 'However, note that not all studies have found an association between
    red meat consumption and breast cancer risk.', 'Most U.S. consumers never eat
    mutton (the meat of grown sheep), which has a strong flavor compared to lamb.',
  'The majority of lambs consumed in the U.S. are grown in Texas, California, Wyoming,
    Colorado or South Dakota and processed in Colorado, Iowa, Michigan or New Jersey.',
  Lambs are normally "finished" (grown to maturity) in feedlots., Colorado produces
    the most organic lambs and sheep., 'However, over 40 percent of U.S. lamb and
    mutton is imported from Australia and New Zealand.', 'If lamb is to be consumed,
    it makes sense to buy grass-fed organic lamb to avoid eating irradiated, growth
    hormone-treated meat from soy- or corn-fed animals.', 'Grass-fed lamb has a more
    favorable fatty acid content, with a higher proportion of omega-3 fatty acids.',
  Note that the organic label does not necessarily mean free range or grass fed.,
  'The primary requirements for lamb to be labeled organic is that the animals are
    raised without the use of antibiotics and growth hormones and that their feed
    (grain, hay, pellets) must be organically grown.', 'Although most New Zealand
    land is grass-fed, lamb grown for export to the U.S. may be corn fed (to satisfy
    U.S. consumer tastes).', Well done and flame-broiled lamb is not recommended.,
  Fat drippings and grill residue scrapings contain particularly high levels of HCAs
    and should be discarded., 'Although we do not recommend supplementation with CLA
    (conjugated linoleic acid), we wish to advise those who do to avoid the t10,c12-CLA
    isomer (referred to on some supplement labels as Trans-10, Cis-12).', 'The t10,c12
    CLA isomer was found to dramatically enhance mammary tumor development in one
    mouse experiment.', 'The time by which 50% of the mice in the group developed
    a tumor was shortened from 267 days for mice on a control diet to 169 days for
    mice fed t10,c12-CLA.', 'Choose products with only the c9,t11 isomer (Cis-9, Trans-11).',
