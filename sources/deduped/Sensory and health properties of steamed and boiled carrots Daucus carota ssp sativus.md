# Sensory and health properties of steamed and boiled carrots (Daucus carota ssp. sativus)

### Abstract

This study examined the influences of domestic processing conditions applied by consumers on firmness, colour and amount of phytochemicals and liking and sensory attributes intensity rating of carrots. The aim was to identify a cooking method and time that yields carrots with higher amount of β-carotene while maintaining consumer _liking_. Instrumentally measured firmness and colour showed comparable degradation trends between cooking methods. While boiling showed a significant decrease in the amount β-carotene after 20 min (−19%), steaming maintained the amount (+40%). Cooking method did not show a significant effect on _liking_ and _intensity ratings_ for the majority of the sensory attributes. _Medium_ firm carrots were liked the most and _low_ firm carrots the least. This study demonstrates that for optimum _liking_, carrots should be in the range of _medium_ firmness. This can be obtained through either cooking methods but steamed carrots possess a higher amount of β-carotene and maintains _liking_.
