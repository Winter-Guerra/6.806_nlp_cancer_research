# Piperlongumine induces cell death through ROS-mediated CHOP activation and potentiates TRAIL-induced cell death in breast cancer cells

## Abstract

### Purpose

Piperlongumine (PL) has been shown to selectively induce apoptotic cell death in cancer cells via reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation. In this study, we characterized a molecular mechanism for PL-induced cell death.

### Methods

Cell viability and cell death were assessed by MTT assay and Annexin V-FITC/PI staining, respectively. ROS generation was measured using the H2DCFDA. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) was used for suppressing gene expression. The mRNA and protein expression were analyzed by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis, respectively.

### Results

We found that PL promotes C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) induction, which leads to the up-regulation of its targets Bim and DR5. Pretreatment with the ROS scavenger _N_-acetyl-cysteine abolishes the PL-induced up-regulation of CHOP and its target genes, suggesting an essential role for ROS in PL-induced CHOP activation. The down-regulation of CHOP or Bim with siRNA efficiently attenuates PL-induced cell death, suggesting a critical role for CHOP in this cell death. Furthermore, PL potentiates TRAIL-induced cytotoxicity in breast cancer cells by upregulating DR5, as DR5 knockdown abolished the sensitizing effect of PL on TRAIL responses.

### Conclusions

Overall, our data suggest a new mechanism for the PL-induced cell death in which ROS mediates CHOP activation, and combination treatment with PL and TRAIL could be a potential strategy for breast cancer therapy.

## Introduction

Piperlongumine (PL) is a natural alkaloid of the long pepper (_Piper longum_) that can selectively kill cancer cells but not normal cells (Bezerra et al. 2008; Raj et al. 2011). A proposed mechanism by which PL induces cancer-selective cell death is by elevating reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. PL directly binds to and inhibits the antioxidant enzyme glutathione S-transferase pi 1, resulting in elevated levels of ROS and subsequent cancer-selective cell death (Raj et al. 2011). ROS are by-products of normal cellular metabolism and play vital roles in stimulating signaling pathways, such as intracellular signal transduction, metabolism, proliferation, and apoptosis. Cancer cells have increased ROS compared with normal cells due to the highly metabolic nature of these cells (Nogueira and Hay 2013). Thus, the high ROS content in cancer cells renders them more susceptible to cell death induced by oxidative stress. As a result, modulating ROS levels have been proposed as a therapeutic strategy to selectively target the destruction of cancer cells (Kong et al. 2000; Nogueira and Hay 2013).

C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP)/growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible gene 153 (GADD153) are a basic leucine zipper transcription factor that is present at very low levels under normal conditions but is robustly expressed by a variety of cellular stresses, such as genotoxic stress, nutrient depletion, or ER stress (Fornace et al. 1988; Ron and Habener 1992; Wang et al. 1996). CHOP functions as a transcription factor that regulates the expression of proapoptotic Bcl-2 family genes, which in turn elicit mitochondrial cell death (McCullough et al. 2001; Puthalakath et al. 2007). Death receptors are members of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family and are also induced by CHOP by various agents (Lee et al. 2009; Lim et al. 2009; Su et al. 2008; Yamaguchi and Wang 2004). TRAIL induces apoptosis by interacting with DR4 (TRAIL-R1) and DR5 (TRAIL-R2), leading to the formation of the death-inducing signal complex with the binding of caspase-8 (Hersey and Zhang 2001). TRAIL induces cell death in various cancer cells but not has little or no effect on most normal cells (Ashkenazi et al. 1999; Walczak et al. 1999). Several reports have shown that DR5 plays a crucial role in sensitizing tumor cells to apoptosis induced by TRAIL and chemotherapeutic agents (Jung et al. 2006; Kim et al. 2008a, b). Understanding the regulatory mechanism of DR5 is an important issue in cancer therapy using combinations of TRAIL and various sensitizing agents. In the present study, we elucidated for the first time that PL induces cell death through ROS-mediated CHOP up-regulation. Furthermore, PL sensitized breast cancer cells to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis mediated by CHOP-dependent DR5 up-regulation, suggesting that combined treatment with PL and TRAIL may be a selective and effective cancer therapy.

## Results


We first investigated the effect of PL on two breast cancer cell lines, MCF7 and BT474, and a normal breast cell line, MCF10A. The cells were incubated for 24 h with various concentrations of PL, and cell viability was determined by MTT assays. As shown in Fig. 1a, PL decreased the viability of breast cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner but was not toxic toward normal breast cells at concentrations below 14 μM. Next, we examined cell death as assessed by annexin V/PI positivity. Cell death with 10 µM PL was induced at 35 % in MCF7 cells and 45 % in BT474 cells (Fig. 1b). Cell death induced by PL was also demonstrated by PARP cleavage (Fig. 1c). However, no significant cell death was observed in PL-treated MCF10A cells (Fig. 1b, c). These data suggest that PL promotes cell death in breast cancer cells but not in normal breast cells.

### PL-induced cell death is mediated by ROS production

Previous studies have shown that increased ROS levels are responsible for cell death induced by PL (Adams et al. 2012; Raj et al. 2011). Therefore, we examined the effect of ROS on PL-induced cell death in breast cancer cells. As expected, PL induced ROS production in MCF7 and BT474 cells, which were nearly decreased to control levels by pretreatment with _N_-acetyl-cysteine (NAC), a selective ROS scavenger (Fig. 2a). However, no changes in ROS levels were observed in the PL-treated MCF10A cells (Fig. 2a). Cell death and PARP cleavage induced by PL were markedly decreased by NAC in both MCF7 and BT474 cells (Fig. 2b, c). These data indicate that ROS play an important role in PL-induced cell death of breast cancer cells.

ROS were detected with H2DCFDA (a). b, c MCF7 and BT474 cells were treated with 10 mM NAC for 30 min, followed by 10 μM PL for 24 h.

Data are presented as the means of triplicate samples, and _error bars_ indicate the SD. _p_ &lt; 0.001 versus the PL-treated group. The indicated protein levels were estimated using Western blot analysis (c). The blot is representative of two independent experiments

### CHOP up-regulation is required for PL-induced cell death

ROS have been shown to induce CHOP expression (Tang et al. 2002). Therefore, we investigated whether PL-induced CHOP up-regulation is ROS-dependent. PL induced CHOP protein and mRNA expression in MCF7 and BT474 cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3a). NAC completely abolished the CHOP induction in response to PL treatment (Fig. 3b), suggesting that ROS are intimately implicated in the PL-induced up-regulation of CHOP.

The indicated protein and mRNA levels were estimated by Western blot and RT-PCR analyses (a, b). Cell viability was measured with an MTT assay (c). The viability of the control cells was set at 100 %, and survival was calculated relative to this value. _p_ &lt; 0.01 versus the siCTL/PL-treated group

To investigate the role of CHOP in PL-induced cell death, its expression was silenced with specific siRNA, followed by PL treatment in both MCF7 and BT474 cells. Knockdown of CHOP significantly attenuated the cell cytotoxicity due to PL treatment (Fig. 3c). These data suggest that the up-regulation of CHOP is required for cell death induced by PL downstream of ROS production.

### Bim up-regulation is required for PL-induced cell death

Next, we investigated the downstream regulatory mechanism(s) of PL-induced CHOP activation. We analyzed CHOP target genes, including Bim, DR4, and DR5, by RT-PCR. We observed that Bim and DR5 mRNA expression increased in a dose-dependent manner in cells treated with PL, and pretreatment with NAC blocked Bim and DR5 induction by PL (Fig. 4a, b). Knockdown of CHOP by siRNA reduced the Bim and DR5 expression induced by PL (Fig. 4c), suggesting that CHOP is responsible for Bim and DR5 induction by PL. Next, we investigated the role of Bim in PL-induced cell death in BT474 breast cancer cells. Silencing of Bim with siRNA significantly suppressed the cell cytotoxicity induced by PL (Fig. 4d, e). These results strongly suggest that Bim up-regulation by PL is dependent on CHOP and is required for the induction of cell death in breast cancer cells.

The indicated mRNA levels were estimated by RT-PCR analysis (a−d). Cell viability was measured with an MTT assay (e). The viability of the control cells was set at 100 %, and survival was calculated relative to this value. _p_ &lt; 0.01 versus the siCTL/PL-treated group

### PL sensitized TRAIL-mediated cell death mediated by DR5 up-regulation

Because TRAIL triggers apoptosis upon binding to two transmembrane agonistic receptors (LeBlanc and Ashkenazi 2003; Takeda et al. 2007; Yagita et al. 2004), we investigated whether PL potentiated TRAIL-induced cell death through the modulation of DR5 expression. As shown in Fig. 5a, markedly increased cell death was observed in MCF7 and BT474 breast cancer cells treated with PL and TRAIL, whereas TRAIL alone did not induce cell death. PARP cleavage was also significantly increased in the cells treated with PL and TRAIL (Fig. 5b). To verify the effects of DR5 with combined PL and TRAIL treatment, its expression was silenced with specific siRNA, followed by PL/TRAIL treatment in MCF7 and BT474 cells. As shown in Fig. 5c and d, DR5 siRNA considerably reduced DR5 mRNA expression and attenuated the cell cytotoxicity induced by treatment with PL/TRAIL. These results indicate that PL could potentiate the TRAIL-induced cell death in breast cancer cells and that its possible mechanism is due to the PL-induced up-regulation of DR5 mediated by CHOP.

## Discussion

PL has been shown to selectively induce apoptotic cell death in cancer cells via accumulation of ROS (Bezerra et al. 2008; Raj et al. 2011). However, little is known about the possible molecular mechanisms by which PL induces cell death. In the present study, we demonstrated that PL-induced cell death by CHOP-dependent Bim activation induced by ROS production in breast cancer cells. In addition, we found that PL potentiated TRAIL-induced cell death through CHOP-dependent DR5 up-regulation.

Cancer cells are depend more on elevated ROS levels and a highly functional anti-oxidant system than normal cells and are thus more vulnerable to agents that impair antioxidant capacity or induce further oxidative stress levels (Nogueira and Hay 2013; Pelicano et al. 2004). A growing body of data suggests that ROS are known mediators of intracellular signaling cascades, which trigger a series of mitochondrial-associated events including apoptotic cell death (Moon et al. 2009; Wang et al. 2008). Consistent with a previous report (Raj et al. 2011), our results showed that PL induced ROS generation and was responsible for induction of cell death in breast cancer cells, whereas ROS generation was not induced in normal breast cells. By pretreating cells with NAC, we found that ROS are essential for the PL-induced apoptosis of breast cancer cells.

The overexpression of CHOP has been reported to lead to cell cycle arrest and/or apoptotic cell death (Barone et al. 1994; Matsumoto et al. 1996; Maytin et al. 2001). We found that PL-induced CHOP activation was markedly suppressed by NAC treatment, suggesting that CHOP activation induced by PL is required for ROS. CHOP knockdown by siRNA effectively reduced PL-induced cell death, confirming that CHOP activation plays an important role in PL-induced cell death. Our findings are similar to a previous study showing that CHOP is involved in ROS-mediated cell death in human acute promyelocytic leukemia and that CHOP silencing reduces sodium selenite-induced apoptotic cell death (Guan et al. 2009).

To verify that elevated CHOP expression induced by PL is associated with increased transcriptional activity, we analyzed CHOP target genes by RT-PCR. Previous studies have reported that proapoptotic BH3-only proteins, such as Bim or puma, are required for CHOP-induced cell death (Galehdar et al. 2010; Ghosh et al. 2012; Puthalakath et al. 2007). However, no changes in puma levels were observed in the cells subjected to PL treatment (data not shown). CHOP silencing inhibited PL-induced Bim mRNA levels and cell death. Additionally, Bim knockdown suppressed cell death induced by PL. These results suggest that CHOP-dependent Bim up-regulation plays a role in breast cancer cell death induced by PL.

The induction of death receptors has been shown to be mediated by CHOP induction (Lee et al. 2009; Lim et al. 2009; Su et al. 2008; Yamaguchi and Wang 2004). Our results showed that CHOP silencing by siRNA effectively blocked the effect of PL on the DR5 induction and cell death (Fig. 5). Therefore, our data showed that PL induced a CHOP-dependent up-regulation of DR5 but not DR4, which potentiates TRAIL-induced cell death in breast cancer cells. Overall, this study provides a new mechanism for PL-induced cell death that is mediated by ROS-dependent CHOP/Bim activation. Furthermore, PL potentiates breast cancer cells to TRAIL through CHOP-mediated DR5 up-regulation. These results suggest that PL has great potential as a therapeutic approach for breast cancer and provide a rational for the combination therapy of PL and TRAIL.
