[Walnuts contain many bioactive components that may slow cancer growth., A previous
    report showed that a diet supplemented with walnuts decreased the tumor size formed
    by MDA-MB-231 human cancer cells injected into nude mice., 'However, the mechanism
    of action was never determined.', 'We characterized the effects of a methanol
    extract prepared from walnuts on human MDA-MB-231, MCF7, and HeLa cells.', The
    extract was cytotoxic to all cancer cells., We identified compounds from the methanol
    extract that induced this cytotoxicity., 'The predominant compounds were Tellimagrandin
    I and Tellimagrandin II, members of the ellagitannin family.', 'We also show a
    walnut extract decreases the intracellular pH, depolarizes the mitochondrial membrane
    with release of cytochrome c and phosphatidylserine flipping.', The antimitogenic
    effects of walnut extract were associated with a twofold reduction of mitochondria
    respiration., These results suggest impairment of mitochondrial function and apoptosis
    as relevant mechanism of anticancer effects of the walnut extract.]
