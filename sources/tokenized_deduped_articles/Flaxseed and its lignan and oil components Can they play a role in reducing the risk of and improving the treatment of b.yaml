["Flaxseed, rich in the phytoestrogen lignans and \u03B1-linolenic acid-rich oil,
    has been suggested to have an anticancer effect.", 'Questions remain whether FS
    and its lignan and oil components are effective in reducing breast cancer risk
    and tumour growth, and can interact beneficially with breast cancer drugs.', 'To
    find answers, in vitro, animal, observational, and clinical studies on FS and
    its lignan and oil components were reviewed.', "The majority of studies in various
    rodent models show that 2.5%\u201310% FS diet or the equivalent amount of lignan
    or oil reduces tumour growth.", Ten percent FS and equivalent lignans do not interfere
    with but rather increase the effectiveness of tamoxifen while the 4% FS oil increases
    trastuzumab/Herceptin effectiveness., 'Observational studies show that FS and
    lignan intake, urinary excretion, or serum levels are associated with reduced
    risk, particularly in postmenopausal women.', "Lignans reduce breast cancer and
    all-cause mortality by 33%\u201370% and 40%\u201353%, respectively, without reducing
    tamoxifen effectiveness.", Clinical trials show that FS reduces tumour growth
    in breast cancer patients and lignans reduces risk in premenopausal women., Mechanisms
    include decreased cell proliferation and angiogenesis and increased apoptosis
    through modulation of estrogen metabolism and estrogen receptor and growth factor
    receptor signalling pathways., More clinical trials are needed but current overall
    evidence indicates that FS and its components are effective in the risk reduction
    and treatment of breast cancer and safe for consumption by breast cancer patients.,
