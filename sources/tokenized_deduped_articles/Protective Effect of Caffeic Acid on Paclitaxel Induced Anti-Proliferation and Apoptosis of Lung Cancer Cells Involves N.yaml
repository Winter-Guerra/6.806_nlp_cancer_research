    model., 'Here we used two human lung cancer cell lines, A549 and H1299, to clarify
    the role of CA in cancer cell proliferation.', The growth assay showed that CA
    moderately promoted the proliferation of the lung cancer cells., 'Furthermore,
    pre-treatment of CA rescues the proliferation inhibition induced by a sub-IC50
    dose of paclitaxel, an anticancer drug.', "Western blot showed that CA up-regulated
    the pro-survival proteins survivin and Bcl-2, the down-stream targets of NF-\u03BAB.",
  "This is consistent with the observation that CA induced nuclear translocation of
    NF-\u03BAB p65.", "Our study suggested that the pro-survival effect of CA on PTX-treated
    lung cancer cells is mediated through a NF-\u03BAB signaling pathway.", This may
    provide mechanistic insights into the chemoresistance of cancer calls., 'Lung
    cancer is the worldwide leading cause of death, and non-small cell lung cancer
    accounts for 80% of total lung cancer cases .', 'Despite the fact that novel chemotherapeutic
    strategies against NSCLC have been developed, the treatments often fail in the
    majority of patients because of the insusceptibility of advanced lung cancer .',
  The rationale of most anti-tumor agents is to kill tumor cells by triggering apoptosis
    signaling pathways., Tumor cells may escape from apoptosis and become more chemoresistant.,
  'For example, the anti-cancer drug, paclitaxel, does not always completely induce
    apoptosis of tumor cells.', 'Instead, tumor cells survive from apoptosis induced
    by PTX, and become more drug-resistant .', '3,4-dihydroxy cinnamic acid or CA,
    a natural phenolic acid product, is found in fruits , wine , and coffee .', 'CA
    has been reported to exert diverse biological activities such as anti-bacterial
    , anti-oxidative  and anti-inflammatory .', 'In addition, previous studies demonstrated

  "Onori\u2019s work reported that CAPE induced anti-proliferation and apoptosis of
    cholangiocarcinoma by inhibiting nuclear factor-\u03BAB activation .", 'In comparison
    to the definite anti-cancer effect of CAPE, some studies showed that CA could
    exert protective effects.', 'For example, CA was shown to prevent oxidative damage
    by enhancing antioxidant activity in cells .', 'Furthermore, CA significantly
    protects neurons of cerebellar granule  and human peripheral blood mononuclear
    cells  from apoptosis.', 'Therefore, the actual effect of CA in chemoresistant
    cells remains unclear.', 'In the study, we investigated the effect of CA on proliferation
    and cell death of human lung cancer cells.', "Our results demonstrated the protective
    effect of CA on paclitaxel-induced cell death in lung cancer cells A549 and H1299,

    .', 'In addition, CA showed protective effect against cytotoxic damages .', 'Although
    previous studies of CA have focused on its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects
    , little is known about the effect of CA on cancer treatment.', Previous studies
    showed that CA induces tumor formation in the fore stomach and kidney in mice
    ., 'Moreover, it has been shown that the combination of CA and anti-cancer drugs
    reduces the cell growth of leukemic monocyte  and inhibits angiogenesis of renal
    carcinoma cells .', 'To examine the effects of CA on proliferation of NSCLC cells,
    the trypan blue based-proliferation assay was performed.', "As shown in Figure
    1, CA exerts no significant cytotoxicity at the dose 50 and 100 \u03BCM towards
    NSCLC A549 cells.", "Our results showed that CA with a concentration lower than
    100 \u03BCM has no significant cytotoxic effect on A549 cells\n\n\n\nTo examine
    whether CA affects the anti-proliferation in lung cancer cells, PTX, a first-line
    drug against lung cancer was used in the study.", "In comparison with PTX treatment
    alone, the proliferation assay showed that 100 \u03BCM of CA pre-treatment significantly
    rescued the proliferation inhibition induced by PTX.", Our results demonstrated
    the protective effect of CA on PTX-induced anti-proliferation in NSCLC cells.,
  'To determine whether CA protects PTX-induced apoptosis of A549 cells, we examined
    the protein levels of the cleaved caspase-3 and Bid by Western blotting.', "Our
    results found that PTX treated samples with 100 \u03BCM of CA pretreatment significantly
    reduced the level of cleaved caspase-3, a cytosolic indicator for apoptosis.",
  'Consistently, the protein level of pro-apoptotic factor Bid was decreased by CA,
    indicating the protective effect of CA on PTX-induced apoptosis of A549 cells.',
  "Furthermore, the effect of CA was observed at 100 \u03BCM of CA but not at 10 \u03BCM,
    suggesting the protective effect of CA in a dose-responsive manner.", 'Survivin,

    pro-survival proteins, including survivin and Bcl-2 , promotes anti-cancer efficacy
    or sensitizes tumor cells toward chemotherapeutic drugs in human tumor cells .',
  'Next, in order to examine how CA attenuates PTX-induced apoptosis of lung cancer
    cells, Western blot for detecting Bcl-2 and survivin was performed.', 'As shown
    in Figure 4, the results showed that pre-treatment of CA induced the accumulation
    of pro-survival proteins Bcl-2 and survivin in A549 and H1299.', The anti-apoptotic
    activity of CA has been previously reported to be modulated through a Bcl-2-independent
    pathway ., 'On the contrary, our result showed that the CA mediated anti-apoptosis
    in lung cancer.', We also observed that the protein level of survivin in H1299
    cells was higher than that in A549 cells after CA pre-treatment., 'Moreover, CA-induced
    up-regulation of survivin was attenuated in H1299 cells with the ectopically expressed
    wild-type p53, indicating the antagonistic role of p53 in the protective effect
    of CA.', 'Furthermore, CA seems to induce higher levels of survivin and Bcl-2
    proteins in H1299 cells, which carry non-functional p53 than in A549 cells that
    carry functional p53.', 'Interestingly, CA-induced expression of pro-survival
    survivin and Bcl-2 proteins in p53-expressing H1299 cells was attenuated compared
    to the parental cells.', 'Accordingly, we suggest that p53 may antagonize the
