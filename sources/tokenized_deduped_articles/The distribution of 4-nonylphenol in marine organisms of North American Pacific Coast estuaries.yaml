['One of the chemical breakdown products of nonylphenol ethoxylates, 4-nonylphenol,
    accumulates in organisms and is of concern as an environmental pollutant due to
    its endocrine disrupting effects.', 'We measured 4-NP levels in the seawater,
    sediment, and twelve organisms within the California estuary, Morro Bay, and examined
    biomagnification of 4-NP using stable isotope abundances to quantify trophic position.',
  "4-NP concentrations in organisms from Morro Bay included 25000 \xB1 8600 ng g\u22121
    lw in liver of California sea lion, 14000 \xB1 5600 ng g\u22121 lw in liver of
    harbor porpoise, 138000 \xB1 55000 ng g\u22121 lw in liver of sea otters, 15700
    \xB1 3600 ng g\u22121 lw in liver of seabirds, 36100 \xB1 6100 ng g\u22121 lw
    in arrow goby fish, 62800 \xB1 28400 ng g\u22121 lw in oysters, and 12700 \xB1
    1300 ng g\u22121 lw in mussels.", '4-NP levels generally showed a pattern of trophic
    dilution among organisms in Morro Bay, with exceptions of biomagnification observed
    between three trophic links: mussel to sea otter, oyster to sea otter, and arrow
    goby to staghorn sculpin.', 'Our examination of other west coast estuaries of
    USA and Canada revealed that mean 4-NP concentrations in gobies and mussels from
    Morro Bay were significantly higher than those from a more urbanized estuary,
    San Francisco Bay and from a remote estuary, Bamfield Inlet, Canada.', 'Relative
    to other estuaries worldwide, 4-NP levels in seawater and sediment of Morro Bay
    are low, but gobies and oysters have higher 4-NP levels than comparable fauna.']
