["Seventeen flavonoids with different substitutions were evaluated for inhibition
    of nuclear factor-\xCE\xBAB signaling in the invasive breast cancer cell line
    MDA-MB-231.", "They were screened using an engineered MDA-MB-231 cell line reporting
    NF-\xCE\xBAB activation.", "The modulation of expression of two NF-\xCE\xBAB regulated
    genes involved in tumorigenesis, matrix metalloproteinase-9, and cyclooxygenase-2
    were also analyzed in these cells.", "Among the compounds tested, all except gossypetin
    and quercetagetin inhibited the activation of NF-\xCE\xBAB, and the expression
    of MMP-9 and COX-2 to different degree.", 'Methylated flavone, chrysoeriol, was
    found to be the most potent inhibitor of MMP-9 and COX-2 expressions.', 'The effect
    of chrysoeriol on cell proliferation, cell cycle, apoptosis and metastasis was
    analyzed by established methods.', Chrysoeriol caused cell cycle arrest at G2/M
    and inhibited migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells., "The structure-activity
    relations amongst the flavonoids as NF-\xCE\xBAB signaling inhibitors was studied.",
  "The study indicates differences between the actions of various flavonoids on NF-\xCE\xBAB
    activation and on the biological activities of breast cancer cells.", 'Flavones
    in general, were more active than the corresponding flavonols.']
