[Epidemiological investigations have suggested a relationship between the nutrition
    and the incidence of various types of cancer., The aim of the study was to determine
    the effect of kefir and milk on the incidence of experimentally induced colorectal
    epithelial tumors., We used 120 ten-week-old male Wistar rats., 'In addition to
    a standard feeding regimen, the first experimental group received kefir containing
    3.5% fat.', 'A second group received kefir with 1.1% fat, and a third group received
    sterilized milk with 1.1% fat.', The kefir 3.5% fat group had the highest number
    of adenocarcinomas., The lowest number of adenocarcinomas was found in the group
    given 1.1% milk fat., 'We found a statistically high correlation between the incidence
    of adenocarcinomas and the fat intake, and a high statistical correlation between
    the incidence of all forms of colorectal epithelial tumors and the intake of fat.']
