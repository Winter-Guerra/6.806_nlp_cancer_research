    of gluconasturtiin., 'Based on these results, it seems that organic baby-leaf
    watercress is a biological sample with an important richness in phytochemicals,
    with potential positives effect on human health.', 'Thus, their consumption must
    be increased either in salads or in soups.', 'In Table 2, our results showed an
    effective antioxidant and antiradical activity which varied with concentration
    tested.', "The percentage of scavenging radicals of DPPH from 1 mg mL\u22121 showed
    high antiradical activity compared to the positive control.", The scavenging effect
    of organic baby-leaf watercress and commercial standards on the DPPH radical increased
    with concentration., The effect of antioxidants on DPPH radical scavenging is
    thought to be due to their hydrogen donating ability., DPPH is a stable free radical
    and accepts an electron or hydrogen radical to become a stable diamagnetic molecule.,

    tested., "With the FRAP method, the antioxidant activity detected at 1 mg mL\u22121
    of watercress extracts was very different and was much lower than the antioxidant
    activity detected for the positive control.We think that this method is not the

    been applied to other substrates; however, it seems not to have the same sensitivity,

    reveals that the antioxidant activity of watercress measured by three different

    activity, measured by the three methods and the concentration of phytochemicals.',

    methods used for their determination.', The spectrophotometric methods used could
    extract other components than phenolics and flavonoids which can interfere with
    the measurement of antioxidant activity., 'Thus, the HPLC methods are always preferable

    the spectrophotometric methods.', 'Based on our results, it seems that watercress

    are important to human health, such as chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, quercetin-3-O-rutinoside,
