[': Intake of sugar-sweetened beverages has increased in North America and seems to
    have several adverse health effects possibly through decreased circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin
    DD) concentrations.', The aim of this cross-sectional study was to evaluate the
    association between sugar-sweetened beverages intake and 25(OH)D concentrations
    among premenopausal women., 'Intake of sugar-sweetened beverages including colas,
    other carbonated beverages and sweet fruit drinks was assessed using a validated
    food frequency questionnaire among 741 premenopausal women.', Plasma concentrations
    of 25(OH)D were quantified by radioimmunoassay., The association between sugar-sweetened
    beverages intake and 25(OH)D concentrations was evaluated using multivariate generalized
    linear models and Spearman correlations., A higher intake of colas was associated
    with lower mean 25(OH)D levels)., A correlation was observed between intake of
    other carbonated beverages and 25(OH)D concentrations but was not statistically
    significant)., No association was observed between intake of sweet fruit drinks
    and 25(OH)D concentrations., This study suggests that high intake of colas may
    decrease 25(OH)D levels in premenopausal women., 'Considering the high consumption
    of these drinks in the general population and the possible consequences of vitamin
    D deficiency on health, this finding needs further investigation.', "25-hydroxyvitamin
    D; vitamin D; carbonated beverages; fructose; premenopausal period; dietary sugars
    \n\n\n\nConsumption of sugar-sweetened beverages has increased considerably in
    the past 30 years and has become one of the main types of beverages in North America
    .", 'In the United States, a citizen consumes on average 12 servings of soda per
    week of which 58% contain sugar .', 'In Canada, soft drinks have been the leading
    beverage choice between 1980 and 2000  and they remain so today .', 'This excessive
    intake of sugar-sweetened beverages may have several adverse effects on human
    health such as diabetes, hypertension , obesity, cardiovascular diseases , low
    bone mineral density , hypocalcaemia  and some types of cancer .', 'Interestingly,
    the link between insufficient circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin DD) concentrations
    and similar health outcomes was established with low bone mineral density , and
    proposed with diabetes , metabolic syndrome , hypertension  and cancer .', 'The
    25(OH)D is the principal circulating vitamin D metabolite and a well-established
    biomarker for total vitamin D exposure from food, supplements and endogenous synthesis
    .', The Institute of Medicine report on dietary reference intake for calcium and
    vitamin D recommends 25(OH)D concentrations of 50 nmol/L or more for good health
    and establishes the deficiency limit at 30 nmol/L ., 'In Canada, 25.7% of the
    population had plasma concentrations of 25(OH)D below 50 nmol/L in 2011 .', 'Thus,
    an inter-individual fluctuation in 25(OH)D concentrations may modulate the risk
    of some diseases, and this fluctuation could be due to genetic or environmental/lifestyle
    factors including nutrition .', 'In fact, some studies found that intake of sugar-sweetened
    beverages could have an impact on circulating concentrations of 25(OH)D. Sugar-sweetened
    beverages, particularly colas, have been shown to decrease concentrations of plasma
    25(OH)D in rats .', 'Following a two-month diet, rats consuming cola beverages
    had significantly lower plasma 25(OH)D concentrations than rats consuming water.',
  'Furthermore, one cross-sectional study among children has shown an inverse association
    of intake of soda and juice with serum concentration of 25(OH)D .', 'Some of the
    nutrients contained in sugar-sweetened beverages, like fructose, caffeine and
    phosphoric acid, have already been proposed to explain the link of such beverages
    with circulating concentrations of 25(OH)D .', 'To further explore this link,
    we have evaluated the association of intake of sugar-sweetened beverages with
    plasma concentrations of 25(OH)D in a population of 741 premenopausal women.',
  Study population and recruitment procedure have been described elsewhere ., 'Briefly,
    premenopausal women were recruited between February and December 2001 at a private
    radiology clinic among those who received a screening mammogram.', 'Exclusion
    criteria were personal history of cancer or breast surgery, having used hormonal
    derivatives within three months prior to mammography, having used tamoxifen or
    raloxifene, being pregnant, having diabetes mellitus, dwarfism/acromegaly, thyroid,
    adrenal, or hepatic disease.', 'Among the 777 premenopausal women recruited, 741
    provided a written informed consent to use their blood sample for assays other
    than those planned at recruitment.', "This study was approved by the Research
    Ethics Review Board-H\xF4pital du Saint-Sacrement du CHU de Qu\xE9bec.", 'Blood
    sample, height, weight, and waist and hip circumferences were collected at recruitment
    by a trained nurse.', 'Information on smoking status, alcohol intake and education
    were collected during a phone interview performed by trained interviewers.', "Physical
    activity was assessed using the Nurses\u2019 Health Study II Activity and Inactivity
    Questionnaire  and then expressed as metabolic equivalent hours per week .", 'Information
    on diet was documented with a 161 item validated , self-administered semi-quantitative
    food frequency questionnaire.', 'Nutrient content of food was assessed at Harvard
    University, using U.S. Department of Agriculture sources, supplemented with data
    from food manufacturers and personal communications with laboratories.', "A standard
    serving size was specified for each item and its frequency of consumption over
    the previous year, ranging from \u201Cnever\u201D to \u201Cmore than three servings
    per day\u201D, was reported.", 'From this food frequency questionnaire, four items
    were classified as sugar-sweetened beverages: colas with sugar containing caffeine,
    colas with sugar but caffeine-free, carbonated beverages with sugar other than
    colas and sweet fruit drinks.', "At the time of collection, samples of blood were
    rapidly aliquoted and stored at \u221280\xB0C for subsequent analyses.", Plasma
    25(OH)D concentrations were quantified by radioimmunoassay after acetonitrile
    extraction between November 2005 and January 2006., "The results met the performance
    target set by the International 25-Hydroxyvitamin D External Quality Assessment
    Scheme Advisory Panel in 2004\u20132005.", 'Four blinded duplicates on average
    were made for each of the 24 batches and the intra-batch and between-batch coefficients
    of variation were 7.3% and 8.8%, respectively.', The frequency of consumption
    of each sugar-sweetened beverage was transformed in number of servings per week
    using the middle of each category when necessary., "For example, when the response
    category was 1\u20133 servings per week, we assigned two servings per week to
    this data.", "The number of servings per week of each item was categorized as
    never, ;1, 1\u20133 and &gt;3 servings/week or to ensure at least 5% of the population
    in each group.", 'Since very few women consumed one serving of caffeine-free cola
    or more per week, this item was combined with regular cola intake.', The sum of
    servings per week of all sugar-sweetened beverages was also calculated and categorized
    according to the same criteria., 'Crude and adjusted mean concentrations of 25(OH)D
    for each category of servings per week were estimated using generalized linear
    models, and the p-value for each estimate compared to the reference category is
    provided.', Spearman coefficients were used to assess the correlation between
    intakes of each sugar-sweetened beverage item and 25(OH)D concentrations as continuous
    variables., 'Determinants of 25(OH)D concentrations identified a priori  and included
    in the adjusted models were age at recruitment, body mass index, waist-to-hip
    ratio, total vitamin D and total calcium intakes from food and supplements in
    the past year, total caloric intake in the past year, season at blood sample collection
    and leisure-time physical activity in the past year, alcohol intake in the past
    year, education, and smoking status.', 'In order to account for the possible displacement
    of milk in the diet by sugar-sweetened beverages, Spearman correlations further
    adjusted for milk intake were also estimated.', Women with missing values were
    excluded from analyses., All tests were 2-sided and a p &lt; 0.05 was considered
    statistically significant., All statistical analyses were carried out using SAS

    25.2 kg/m2 on average., 'The mean plasma concentration of 25(OH)D was 65.0 nmol/L,
    23.2% of the women had 25(OH)D concentrations below the 50 nmol/L recommended
    and 1.75% were below the deficiency level of 30 nmol/L.', 'Regarding calcium intake,
    the mean concentration in this study population was below the dietary reference
    intake recommended by the Institute of Medicine report.', Most of the women in
    this population were non-consumers of colas or consumed less than one serving
    per week of this type of beverage., 'Similar patterns were observed for other
    carbonated beverages and sweet fruit drinks with 44.2% and 50.7% for non-consumers
    and 44.3% and 35.6% for less than one serving per week, respectively.', 'Abbreviations:

    was observed between age, waist-to-hip ratio, smoking status or intake of alcohol

    changed the observed correlation between education, calcium or caloric intake
    with 25(OH)D concentrations, r = 0.13, r = \u22120.08, respectively), but all
    of the other correlations remained essentially unchanged.", 'In this study, we
    found that higher intake of colas was associated with lower plasma concentrations
    of 25(OH)D among premenopausal women.', 'Compared to non-consumers, women who
    drank more than three servings per week of colas presented a mean concentration
    of 25(OH)D that was 12.7% lower.', 'In the latter category of colas consumption,
    47.8% of women presented 25(OH)D concentrations below the recommended 50 nmol/L.',
  'Furthermore, 10.9% of these women had 25(OH)D concentrations below 30 nmol/L, which
    are considered as deficient concentrations.', 'In comparison, only 16.3% of the
    women who never drank colas presented concentrations of 25(OH)D below 50 nmol/L
    of which only 0.3% were below 30 nmol/L.', Few studies have evaluated the association
    between intake of sugar-sweetened beverages and concentrations of 25(OH)D ., 'Following
    a two month diet, Garcia-Contreras and colleagues observed lower plasma 25(OH)D
    concentrations among rats consuming colas beverages compared to those who drank
    water .', 'In a cross-sectional study conducted among 411 obese children, Olson
    and colleagues found that both intake of sodas and juices were inversely associated
    with serum concentrations of 25(OH)D .', Our observations appear consistent with
    these studies conducted in population other than premenopausal women., 'One study,
    among women, has evaluated short-term effects of carbonated beverages consumption
    on serum concentrations of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D2D), the active form of vitamin
    D metabolized by the kidney and target tissues from 25(OH)D .', 'Concentrations
    of 1,25(OH)2D were lower in the group following a diet high in colas intake compared
    to women following a diet without cola, but the association was not significant.',
  'However, the study population was very small and the serum concentrations of 1,25(OH)2D
    may not be the best biomarker to represent vitamin D concentrations .', Some authors
    have brought the idea that the effect of intake of colas on 25(OH)D concentrations
    was due to a replacement of the milk consumption by colas ., 'However, further
    adjustment for milk intake did not materially alter our results, suggesting that
    this factor does not confound the observed associations with 25(OH)D concentrations.',
  'In our study, we found an inverse association of intake of colas with 25(OH)D concentrations
    and also a non-significant negative correlation between intake of other carbonated
    beverages and 25(OH)D concentrations.', 'However, the intake of sweet fruit drinks
    was not associated with 25(OH)D concentrations.', 'In comparison to sweet fruit
    drinks, carbonated beverages contain a higher concentration of fructose which
    is derived from corn syrup and used as a sweetener .', It has been suggested that
    fructose may have an effect on vitamin D metabolism ., 'In fact, the liver and
    kidneys, the principal sites of vitamin D metabolism, seem adversely affected
    by chronic fructose intake .', "Moreover, one study conducted among rats with
    compromised renal function has shown that those fed with fructose had a reduction
    of 30%\u201340% in their 25(OH)D serum concentrations compared to rats fed with
    glucose .", This observation could explain the observed lower 25(OH)D concentrations
    with higher intake of carbonated beverages in our population., 'Furthermore, we
    observed no association between intake of diet colas and 25(OH)D concentrations.',
  'However, the statistically significant association found with intake of colas was
    stronger than that of intake of other sweet carbonated beverages and thus may
    not be solely due to fructose.', A difference between colas and other sugar-sweetened
    beverages is that they contain caffeine which has been shown to increase the risk
    of osteoporosis ., 'To take this into consideration, we have made separate analyses
    of intakes of regular colas and caffeine free colas with 25(OH)D concentrations,
    and found similar negative correlations for both types of colas.', 'Thus, in the
    present study, caffeine does not seem to explain the results.', 'In contrast to
    other sugar-sweetened beverages, colas also contain phosphoric acid  and excessive
    exogenous phosphate intake is believed to cause vitamin D and calcium metabolism
    disorders .', 'One study has shown that intake of soft drinks containing phosphoric
    acid induced hyperphosphaturia and significant reductions in plasma concentrations
    of 1,25(OH)2D and 25(OH)D in immature rats .', 'All of these hypotheses need to
    be confirmed with additional studies, especially among humans.', This study has
    several strengths., The study sample was relatively large and the women were recruited
    in a short period of time., The measurement of plasma 25(OH)D concentrations was
    done with respect to high quality standards and the food frequency questionnaire
    used to assess intake of sugar-sweetened beverages was validated in other studies
    for its accuracy ., Several possible confounding factors of the association between
    intake of sugar-sweetened beverages and 25(OH)D concentrations were taken into
    account., 'Furthermore, the women of this study lived in the same geographic area,
    thus were exposed to the same climatic conditions and the assessments of leisure-time
    physical activity with the season at blood sampling allowed for a good adjustment
    for sun exposure.', 'Thereby, the difference seen in 25(OH)D concentrations was
    probably not caused by differences in vitamin D intake, milk intake or sun exposure.',
  This study has also some limitations., Misclassification in the frequency of consumption
    of sugar-sweetened beverages is possible with the use of a food frequency questionnaire.,
  Intake of sugar-sweetened beverages over the previous year was an estimation given
    by each participant., 'However, differential bias is unlikely because answers
    inaccuracies can hardly be related to 25(OH)D concentrations and if there was
    misclassification, it could only lead to an underestimation of the effect.', 'Also,
    it was difficult to state on the biological mechanism because the nutrients contained
    in colas that can be responsible for the lower 25(OH)D concentration were already
    present in several other foods.', 'Despite introduction of season at blood sampling
    and leisure-time physical activity in the models, the adjustment for sun exposure
    was not perfect because the information about clothing style, sunscreen use and
    time spent outdoors other than leisure-time physical activity were not available.',
  It is therefore possible that colas drinkers spent less time outdoors than non-drinkers
    and this could lead to residual confounding., 'Intake of colas may also be viewed
    as a proxy of an unhealthy lifestyle which could include higher BMI, waist-to-hip
    ratio, intake of alcohol and calorie and smoking habit, and lower intake of calcium
    and vitamin D and levels of physical activity.', 'However, in our data, the correlations
    between such 25(OH)D determinants and 25(OH)D concentrations that were statistically
    significant remained so even after the introduction of total intake of colas in
    the model.', 'Furthermore, this study population was limited to premenopausal
    women so inference to other populations is difficult to make.', 'Finally, the
    cross-sectional design of this study does not allow causal interpretation.', 'In
    conclusion, we found that premenopausal women with higher intake of colas had
    lower circulating concentrations of 25(OH)D. To our knowledge, this is the first
    report of this association in such type of population.', 'Considering the importance
    of vitamin D concentrations in the maintenance of a good health and the possible
    links of vitamin D deficiency to some diseases, our findings need further investigation.',
  'In our study population, the intake of colas was not very high, but in other populations
    this consumption can be more significant and may affect 25(OH)D concentrations
    in a greater manner.', 'Considering the high consumption of this type of beverage
    in the general population, further studies are needed to elucidate the findings
    of the present study.', Supported by grants from the Canadian Breast Cancer Research
