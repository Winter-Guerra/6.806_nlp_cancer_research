[Some widely consumed legumes could potentially be used as alternatives to soy as
    a source of dietary isoflavones., 'In this study, 6 legumes were analysed to determine
    their contents for 10 different isoflavones.', Methanolic extracts obtained by
    ultrasound-assisted extraction were analysed by triple quadrupole LC-MS/MS., 'Chickpeas
    were the best source of isoflavones, with a significant amount of biochanin A
    and its conjugated form, sissotrin.', Kidney beans had the second highest concentration
    of isoflavones and were particularly rich in genistin., "The total isoflavone
    concentrations of yellow split lentils, green lentils, red lentils and haricot
    beans were each below 200.0 \xCE\xBCg/kg.", It was determined that the legumes
    commonly consumed in Western diets are not good alternatives to soy and soy products
    as sources of isoflavones.]
