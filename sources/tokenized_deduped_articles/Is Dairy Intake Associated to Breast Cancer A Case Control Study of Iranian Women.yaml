[Current epidemiologic data lack consistent evidence for an association between consumption
    of dairy products and breast cancer risk., In this study we assessed the relationship
    between consumption of dairy products and the odds of breast cancer., This case-control
    study was conducted on 275 women., 'Data regarding sociodemographic factors, medical
    history, medications, and anthropometric measurements were collected.', Dietary
    data were assessed using a validated food frequency questionnaire., The odds  of
    breast cancer were estimated across quartile categories of energy-adjusted dairy
    intake using multiple logistic regression models with adjustment for confounders.,
  We observed that higher consumption of total dairy intake was accompanied with reduced
    breast cancer risk ., A similar inverse association was also observed for higher
    intakes of low-fat and fermented dairy products., 'Lower intake of high-fat dairy
    was associated with reduced odds of breast cancer, and no significant association
    was found between nonfermented dairy and breast cancer risk.', 'Our study demonstrates
    the protective effects of high intakes of total dairy, low-fat and fermented dairy,
    as well as low intakes of high-fat dairy products against breast cancer risk and
    shows no association with nonfermented dairy.']
