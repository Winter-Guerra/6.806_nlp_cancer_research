['Photo-activation of psoralen with UVA irradiation, referred to as PUVA, is used
    in the treatment of proliferative skin disorders.', 'The anti-proliferative effects
    of PUVA have been largely attributed to psoralen intercalation of DNA, which upon
    UV treatment, triggers the formation of interstrand DNA crosslinks that inhibit
    transcription and DNA replication.', 'Here, we show that PUVA exerts antitumor
    effects in models of human breast cancer that overexpress the ErbB2 receptor tyrosine
    kinase oncogene, through a new mechanism.', 'Independent of ICL formation, the
    antitumor effects of PUVA in ErbB2+ breast cancer models can instead be mediated
    through inhibition of ErbB2 activation and signaling.', 'Using a mass spectroscopy-based
    approach, we show for the first time that photo-activated 8MOP interacts with
    the ErbB2 catalytic autokinase domain.', 'Furthermore, PUVA can reverse therapeutic
    resistance to lapatinib and other ErbB2 targeted therapies, including resistance
    mediated via expression of a phosphorylated, truncated form of ErbB2 that is preferentially
    expressed in tumor cell nuclei.', 'Current ErbB2 targeted therapies, small molecule
    kinase inhibitors or antibodies, do not block the phosphorylated, activated state
    of p85ErbB2.', Here we show that PUVA reduced p85ErbB2 phosphorylation leading
    to tumor cell apoptosis., 'Thus, in addition to its effects on DNA and the formation
    of ICL, PUVA represents a novel ErbB2 targeted therapy for the treatment of ErbB2+

    is a linear tricyclic molecule that readily enters cell nuclei where it intercalates
    DNA at pyrimidine-purine sites ., 'Following photo-activation by UV irradiation,
    a combination referred to as PUVA, 8MOP interacts with pyrimidines to form stable
    DNA monoadducts.', 'Upon further UVA treatment, a percentage of monoadducts can
    then be converted to interstrand DNA crosslinks, which in turn inhibit transcription
    and DNA replication , .', 'Importantly, the anti-proliferative effects of PUVA
    appear to be related to the formation of ICL, rather than monoadducts.', 'Because
    of its anti-proliferative effects, PUVA has been used to treat hyperproliferative
    skin conditions including psoriasis .', "Furthermore, T lymphocytes- normal and
    malignant- appear to be particularly sensitive to the anti-proliferative effects
    of PUVA therapy; hence, the use of PUVA as a treatment for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma
    and graft-versus-host disease \u2013.", "In addition to playing a role in the
    formation of ICL, there is evidence that psoralen may also target non-nuclear
    proteins, lipids, and cellular membrane components \u2013.", 'For example, Laskin
    et al used psoralen derivatives incapable of forming DNA adducts in response to
    UV irradiation to show that PUVA treatment blocked the mitogenic effects of soluble
    Epidermal Growth Factor on its cognate cell surface receptor, EGF Receptor , .',
  'Interestingly, inhibition of EGFR phosphorylation in response to PUVA was not mediated
    through a direct psoralen-EGFR interaction, but rather psoralen interacting with
    a lower molecular weight binding protein.', 'Similar to EGFR, the ErbB2 oncogene
    is a member of the type 1 transmembrane family of receptor tyrosine kinases.',
  'Gene amplification and overexpression of ErbB2, which occurs in 25% of all breast
    cancers, predicts for a poor clinical outcome as a consequence of increased tendency
    to metastasize to visceral organs earlier in the disease course , .', These findings
    have prompted the development of ErbB2 targeted therapies- biological and small
    molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors- for the treatment of early and advanced stage
    ErbB2+ breast cancers ., "Although ErbB2 targeted therapies represent a significant
    advancement in the treatment of aggressive breast cancers, their clinical efficacy
    has been limited by the inevitable development of therapeutic resistance, particularly
    in the advanced stage setting \u2013.", 'Using mass spectroscopy and biochemical
    approaches, we now show for the first time that photo-activated 8MOP can directly
    interact with regulatory elements within the ErbB2 catalytic kinase domain, providing
    a likely explanation for the targeted inhibition of ErbB2 signaling in response
    to PUVA therapy.', 'Furthermore, a modified psoralen derivative that lacks the
    ability to crosslink DNA maintained its ability to block ErbB2 signaling and induce
    tumor cell apoptosis.', 'Importantly, we show that PUVA can trigger significant

    as means with standard error bars included., Students t-test was used to determine
    statistical significance between 2 groups., A value of p;0.05 was considered a
    statistically significant difference., The growth and viability of ErbB2+ breast
    cancer cell lines was significantly inhibited by PUVA therapy in a dose-dependent
    manner., The loss of tumor cell viability appeared to be related to induction
    of apoptosis., 'In contrast, PUVA therapy using identical treatment conditions
    had relatively less effect on the growth and viability of MCF7 cells, a ErbB2
    non-overexpressing human breast cancer cell line and a non-malignant human foreskin
    fibroblast cell line.', It was therefore tempting to speculate that photo-activated
    8MOP might directly modulate ErbB2 activation and signaling., 'Seeking to demonstrate
    the effects of PUVA on ErbB2 signaling, we showed that steady-state protein levels
    of the activated, phosphorylated form of ErbB2 were reduced in PUVA-treated ErbB2+
    breast cancer cell lines in a dose-dependent manner.', 'In addition, total ErbB2
    protein levels were reduced in response to higher doses of PUVA therapy.', 'In
    addition, the activated, phosphorylated forms of Akt and Erk1/2, which are key
    downstream mediators of the PI3K and MAPK signaling pathways, respectively were
    also inhibited by PUVA.', 'In contrast, treatment with the same dose of UV irradiation
    or 8MOP alone had relatively little effect on cell viability or ErbB2 signaling.',
  'Cells were pre-treated with the indicated concentrations of 8MOP for 4 hr before
    UVA irradiation, and then cultured for an additional 72 hr before being analyzed
    for cell growth BT474; SKBR3; MCF7, HFF and apoptosis BT474; SKBR3.', Cells treated
    with vehicle alone served as controls., "Results represent the mean +/\u2212 standard
    error of triplicate samples, and are representative of three independent experiments.",
  'BT474, SKBR3 and MCF7 cells were subjected to the indicated treatment conditions
    as described in Figure 1.', Western blot analysis was performed on whole cell
    lysates., Actin steady-state protein levels served as a control to ensure for
    equal loading of protein., Results are representative of three independent experiments.,
  'We synthesized a derivative of psoralen, 7-methylpyridopsoralen, which lacks the
    DNA binding motif, making it unable to generate ICLs.', We next sought to determine
    the effects of this compound on ErbB2 signaling and tumor cell viability following
    UVA irradiation., 'Upon photo-activation, 7-methylpyridopsoralen significantly
    inhibited the growth and viability of ErbB2+ breast cancer cells, which correlated
    with inhibition of phosphorylated and total ErbB2 protein expression.', These
    findings suggested that interruption of ErbB2 signaling in PUVA-treated tumor
    cells can be mediated by a mechanism(s) independent of ICL formation., We next
    sought to determine whether 8MOP can directly interact with the catalytic kinase
    domain of ErbB2., 'In this regard, BT474 cells were treated with biotinylated-8MOP
    and a pull-down experiment was performed.', Biotinylated-8MOP-protein complexes
    were isolated from BT474 cell lysate on immobilized streptavidin magnetic beads
    and subjected to protein digestion using sequencing grade modified trypsin., Peptides
    were then isolated by LC-MS/MS., 'We identified three 8MOP bound peptides that
    corresponded to two sites located within the catalytic kinase domain, and one
    site in the peptide crossover kinase domain.', 'As a second independent approach
    to demonstrate the interaction between 8MOP and ErbB2, BT474 cells were treated
    with fluorophore-labeled 8MOP and UVA irradiation.', Cell lysates were separated
    under non-denaturing conditions using native gel electrophoresis., 'Proteins were
    transferred to a PVDF membrane, and the fluorophore-labeled 8MOP detected by an
    Odyssey scanner.', The membrane was then blotted with a primary fluoro-labeled
    ErbB2 antibody., 'The fluoro-conjugated 8MOP was detected at the same molecular
    weight as large ErbB2 complexes, findings that were consistent with the LC-MS/MS
    data indicating that 8MOP can directly interact with the ErbB2 receptor.', Figure
    3., Inhibition of ErbB2 signaling in response to PUVA is independent of DNA crosslinking.,
  'The chemical structures of 8MOP, and 7-methylpyridopsoralen, which is a derivative
    of 8MOP that lacks the ability to crosslink DNA, are shown.', BT474 and SKBR3

    served as control for 48 hr and then exposed to UV irradiation prior to Western
    blot analysis., The image on the left shows the Western blot for ErbB2., 'The
    image on the right shows the same membrane directly scanned for the presence of
    800dye-8MOP, which overlays the ErbB2 signal.', The results are representative
    of three independent experiments., Targeted therapies tend to be more clinically
    efficacious in combination with other targeted or cytotoxic drugs., 'We therefore
    evaluated a variety of targeted agents in combination with PUVA including PI3K
    inhibitors, HDAC inhibitors, PARP inhibitors, and other ErbB TKIs.', 'The most
    promising combination was with neratinib, a small molecule, irreversible pan-ErbB
    tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is currently in late phase clinical trials .',
  'Treatment of ErbB2+ breast cancer cells with the combination of 8-MOP, UVA irradiation,
    and neratinib, each at sub-lethal doses when used alone, resulted in significantly
    enhanced inhibition of cell viability.', 'The effects of this combination on ErbB2,
    ErbB3 and downstream signaling pathways were further analyzed.', 'Consistent with
    our recent findings , we found that neratinib treatment alone resulted in a marked
    reduction in total ErbB2 and ErbB3 protein levels, with consequential loss of
    p-Akt expression.', 'Interestingly, neratinib in combination with UVA irradiation
    alone led to further loss of total ErbB2 and ErbB3 protein expression, which was
    more pronounced in SKBR3 cells.', Figure 5., The combination of PUVA with the

    loading of protein., The results are representative of three independent experiments.,
  "We recently showed that development of acquired therapeutic resistance to the reversible
    HER2 and EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor lapatinib in HER2+ breast cancer cells
    can be mediated by a number of mechanisms including: a switch in the regulation
    of cell survival from HER2-HER3-PI3K signaling in treatment na\xEFve cells to
    EGFR-HER3-PI3K in resistant cells ; and expression of a truncated ErbB2 form preferentially
    expressed in tumor cell nuclei .", We next sought to determine whether PUVA treatment
    could reverse lapatinib resistance., 'Using models of lapatinib resistance established
    in our laboratory -, we treated rBT474 and rSKBR3 cells with PUVA at the indicated
    concentrations of 8MOP.', "Resistant cells were continuously maintained in the
    presence of 1 \xB5M lapatinib.", 'As shown, PUVA treatment significantly reduced
    tumor cell growth and viability in a dose-dependent manner.', 'In contrast to
    isotype-matched parental cells, total EGFR and ErbB3 protein expression was markedly
    reduced in PUVA-treated rBT474 and rSKBR3, in addition to reduction in the expression
    of phosphorylated forms of EGFR, ErbB3, and Akt.', 'The effects of PUVA on Akt
    T308 are particularly interesting in light of our recent finding that Akt T308,
    but not S473, remained persistently phosphorylated in lapatinib resistant cells
    .', 'Importantly, PARP cleavage product was increased in PUVA-treated lapatinib
    resistant tumor cells consistent with induction of apoptosis.', '(A) Equal numbers

    and the effects on cell growth and viability are shown.', P values of statistical
    significance are indicated., "Results represent the mean +/\u2212 standard error

  The corresponding Western blot analysis for each of the indicated treatment conditions
    is shown., "As indicated, rBT474 and rSKBR3 cells are continuously maintained
    in 1 \xB5M lapatinib.", Actin steady-state protein levels served as a control
    to ensure for equal loading of protein., Results are representative of three independent
    experiments., 'We have also shown that expression of an 85 kDa truncated form
    of ErbB2 that lacks the extracellular and transmembrane domains, is preferentially
    expressed in the nuclei of tumors that have become resistant to lapatinib .',
  'Moreover, expression of p85ErbB2 under the control of a heterologous promoter can
    render cells resistant to lapatinib and other ErbB2 targeted drugs in otherwise
    sensitive ErbB2+ breast cancer cells .', 'Although p85ErbB2 is tyrosine phosphorylation,
    an indication of its activated state, it is not inhibited by lapatinib .', 'To
    study the effects of PUVA on p85ErbB2, we established a T47D transfected breast
    cancer cell that stably expresses phosphorylated p85ErbB2 in tumor cell nuclei
    as previously described .', 'T47D cells, although not HER2 overexpressing, still
    express full-length HER2.', PUVA therapy has an antitumor effect in T47D cells
    transfected with empty vector alone that is associated full-length ErbB2., 'However,
    in p85 expressing T47D cells, treatment with PUVA, but not lapatinib, markedly
    inhibited p85ErbB2 phosphorylation, triggering tumor cell apoptosis.', Top bar
    graph shows the results of the growth assays performed in T47D and stably transfected
    T47D cell line., "T47D cells expressing p85ErbB2 were pretreated with 5 \xB5M
    lapatinib or 5 \xB5M 8MOP for 4 hr followed by irradiation in a UV Stratalinker
    1800.", 'Cells transfected with empty vector, and those treated with vehicle alone

    are shown by Western blot., Actin steady-state protein levels served as a control
    to ensure for equal loading of protein., Results are representative of three independent
    experiments., The molecular basis for the anti-proliferative effects of photo-activated
    psoralen in the treatment of benign and neoplastic skin diseases has historically
    been attributed to the formation of interstrand DNA crosslinks that lead to inhibition
    of transcription and DNA replication., 'T cells, which mediate many of the dermatological
    indications for PUVA e.g.', graft-versus-host disease; cutaneous T cell lymphoma
    seem to be particularly sensitive to the anti-proliferative effects of PUVA and
    have therefore served as a frequently used model to study the biological effects
    of PUVA therapy -., 'In contrast, there has been relatively little scientific
    evidence to support the use of PUVA therapy in the treatment of solid tumors.',
  'Here, we show for the first time that PUVA therapy can directly target the catalytic
    kinase domain of the ErbB2 receptor tyrosine kinase oncogene.', 'The interaction
    of photo-activated 8MOP with regulatory elements within the ErbB2 catalytic kinase
    domain may explain the marked inhibition of ErbB2 signaling in PUVA-treated ErbB2+
    breast cancer cells, including those that have developed resistant to current
    FDA-approved ErbB2 targeted therapies.', 'The interaction between 8MOP and ErbB2
    was demonstrated using two independent strategies: LC/MS/MS; and Western blot
    analysis.', These findings were further supported by the observation that a DNA
    non-crosslinking psoralen derivative maintained its ability to block ErbB2 signaling
    and induce tumor cell apoptosis., 'The ErbB2+ breast cancer cell lines used in
    these studies express EGFR, which has also been shown to be a target of PUVA therapy
    .', 'However, survival of parental BT474 and SKBR3 cells is not dependent upon
    EGFR, but instead, dependent upon signaling via ErbB2-ErbB3 heterodimers .', Our
    data suggests that the antitumor effects of PUVA therapy in parental ErbB2+ breast
    cancer cells were mediated through direct effects on ErbB2., 'Moreover, non-malignant
    HFF cells that express wild-type EGFR were less sensitive to the apoptotic effects
    of PUVA, consistent with the notion that EGFR is not responsible for induction
    of apoptosis in PUVA-treated ErbB2+ breast cancer cells.', Of particular interest
    is the antitumor activity of PUVA therapy in ErbB2+ breast cancer models of acquired
    therapeutic resistance to lapatinib and other ErbB2 targeted therapies., It is
    worth noting that acquired therapeutic resistance to lapatinib does not appear
    to be mediated by reactivation of ErbB2 signaling., 'In fact, ErbB2 phosphorylation
    remains inhibited in resistant cells , .', 'Importantly, targeted molecular knockdown
    of ErbB2 does not reverse lapatinib resistance , indicating that survival of resistant
    cells is no longer dependent upon ErbB2 alone, at least not the 185 kDa full-length
    form of ErbB2 expressed at the cell surface.', 'Instead, the viability of lapatinib
    resistant ErbB2+ breast cancer cells is dependent upon other factors.', 'For example,
    we have shown that resistant cells express a truncated form of ErbB2, referred
    to as p85ErbB2, which can be generated by alternate initiation of translation  and/or
    proteolytic processing of p185ErbB2 .', 'Moreover, p85ErbB2 is preferentially
    expressed in tumor cell nuclei.', 'This nuclear, truncated form of ErbB2 lacks
    the extracellular and transmembrane domains, while retaining the full cytoplasmic
    domain, including the catalytic kinase domain and tyrosine autophosphorylation
    sites.', 'Expression of p85ErbB2 driven by a heterologous promoter renders ErbB2+
    breast cancer cells that are normally sensitive to the antitumor effects of lapatinib,
    resistant to lapatinib and other ErbB2 targeted therapies.', 'Although the exact
    mechanism of p85ErbB2 action is unknown, it, in contrast to p185ErbB2 and p110ErbB2\-
    a membrane-bound form of ErbB2 that lacks the ECD- does not appear to activate
    cytoplasmic protein kinase signaling cascades .', We have shown that tyrosine
    phosphorylation of p85ErbB2 is not inhibited by lapatinib or similar TKIs in class.,
  'We now show that PUVA therapy blocks p85ErbB2 phosphorylation, triggering apoptosis.',
  One potential explanation is that lapatinib cannot access the ATP binding groove
    of p85ErbB2., 'In contrast, the ability of 8MOP to access nuclear targets e.g.',
  'DNA, is well-established.', 'It is therefore tempting to speculate that 8MOP more
    readily accesses, and blocks the catalytic kinase domain of p85ErbB2.', "We recently
    showed that development of lapatinib resistance can be mediated through a switch
    in the regulation of cell survival from ErbB2-ErbB3-PI3K signaling in treatment
    na\xEFve ErbB2+ breast cancer cells to ErbB3-EGFR-PI3K-PDK1-Akt signaling axis
    in the resistant setting, the latter driven in part through autocrine production
    of the ErbB3 ligand heregulin \u03B21.", 'Although the exact mechanism(s) underlying
    the antitumor effects of PUVA is unknown, persistent phosphorylation of Akt T308,
    which was seen in models of lapatinib resistance , was inhibited by PUVA.', 'In
    addition, total EGFR and ErbB3 were reduced in PUVA-treated resistant cells.',
  These findings are interesting in light of a recent study showing that several ErbB
    TKIs can induce proteolysis of targeted receptor(s) in a manner similar to hsp90
    antagonists ., 'Induction of receptor proteolysis by TKIs, including lapatinib,
    was shown to be mediated through ATP competitive binding with cdc37, the latter
    stimulating binding between the client protein e.g.', ErbB2 and hsp90., 'It is
    therefore tempting to speculate that PUVA therapy may also trigger degradation
    of EGFR, ErbB2, and ErbB3 by blocking access of the cdc37/hsp90 complex to client
    proteins ErbB receptors.', We propose that 8-MOP interacts with the ErbB2 catalytic
    kinase domain at amino acid residues distinct from lapatinib., 'Although structural
    analysis of a lapatinib-EGFR complex has been reported, there has been no structural
    analysis of a lapatinib-ErbB2 complex.', Most of the amino acid residues associated
    with the regulation of the ErbB2 catalytic kinase activity are located in the
    vicinity of the ATP binding groove within the deep cleft located between the N-
    and C-terminal lobes of the ErbB2 receptor ., 'We found that 8MOP interacts with
    peptides located within the DFG motif and activation loop of the C-lobe, both
    of which are involved in regulating ErbB2 autokinase activity .', The structural
    analysis of lapatinib-EGFR crystals suggests that lapatinib likely interacts with
    amino acid residues within the ATP binding groove distinct from those of photo-activated
    8MOP ., 'It is possible therefore that photo-activated 8-MOP binds to the catalytic
    kinase domain, blocking its activity and triggering proteolysis of the receptor
    in a manner similar to irreversible ErbB TKIs e.g.', neratinib., Targeted therapies
    are increasingly being used in combination with other targeted and cytotoxic drugs
    ., We were interested to find out whether other targeted therapies might enhance
    the antitumor activity of PUVA therapy., 'In this regard, a recent study found
    that the combination of a histone deacetylase inhibitor and PUVA led to enhanced
    antitumor activity compared with either treatment alone .', 'When we examined
    the effects of adding targeted therapies, including HDAC and PI3K inhibitors,
    to PUVA therapy, we found that neratinib, at sub-lethal doses alone, significantly
    increased apoptosis in ErbB2+ breast cancer cells when combined with PUVA.', 'It
    is known that neratinib has promiscuous inhibitory activity against non-ErbB kinases,
    including MAP kinase family members.', 'It is possible that the enhanced antitumor
    effect observed with the addition of neratinib to PUVA might be directly or indirectly
    related to inhibition of a kinase(s) involved in DNA repair of ICL, thereby sensitizing
    tumor cells to the DNA damaging effects of PUVA.', The data presented here suggests
    that the antitumor effects of PUVA can be mediated through DNA-independent mechanisms.,
  It is possible that inhibition of the ErbB2 signaling axis may sensitize tumor cells
    to the DNA damaging effects of PUVA therapy by inhibiting P3K-Akt regulated DNA
    damage repair enzymes., 'In this context, ErbB2 targeted therapies have previously
    been shown to sensitize tumor cells to radiation therapy .', "Therefore, therapeutic
    interventions, including PUVA alone or in combination with ErbB targeted therapies
    such as neratinib that can simultaneously damage DNA and also block ErbB-regulated
    survival pathways including those that repair damaged DNA, represent an attractive
    therapeutic strategy in treatment na\xEFve ErbB2+ tumors and those that have developed
    resistance to ErbB2 targeted therapies through activation of alternate pathways
    e.g.", 'ErbB3-EGFR-PDK1-Akt signaling axis, and express nuclear truncated ErbB2
    receptors that elude the inhibition by existing ErbB2 targeted therapies.', 'Conceived
