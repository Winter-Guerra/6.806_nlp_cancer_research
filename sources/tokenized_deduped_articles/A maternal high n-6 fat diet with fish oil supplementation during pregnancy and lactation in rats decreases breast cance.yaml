[The timing of dietary fat intake may modify breast cancer risk., 'In addition, n-3
    fatty acids reduce, and n-6 fatty acids increase, the risk of breast cancer and
    a maternal high n-6 fat diet results in a greater risk of breast cancer in the
    female offspring.', We hypothesized that the timing of n-3 fatty acid-enriched
    fish oil supplementation would be important for reducing the risk of breast cancer.,
  'Female rats were fed to a high n-6 fat diet containing 20% of the sunflower oil
    by weight during pregnancy and lactation, and the female offspring were exposed
    to fish oil by oral gavage either during the perinatal period via maternal intake
    or during puberty or adulthood.', Exposure during the perinatal period to a maternal
    high n-6 fat diet with fish oil supplementation significantly reduced the incidence
    of carcinogen-induced mammary tumors in the female offspring compared to a maternal
    high n-6 fat diet with no fish oil supplementation or fish oil supplementation
    later in life., We found that a maternal high n-6 fat diet during pregnancy is
    more important in increasing the risk of mammary tumors in the female offspring
    than a maternal high n-6 fat diet during lactation., 'This study suggests that
    fish oil supplementation during the perinatal period decreases the effect of a
    maternal high n-6 fat diet on subsequent carcinogen-induced mammary tumor risk,
    whereas fish oil supplementation during puberty or adulthood does not.']
