[Buckwheat is an ancient dicotyledonous crop belonging to Polygonaceae family., It
    is cultivated and adapted to marginal lands with harsh environments., Buckwheat
    has been praised as one of the most faddish green functional foods., Many functional
    foods including tea made from buckwheat have been put into production around the
    globe., 'The buckwheat proteins are particularly rich in lysine and contain less
    glumatic acid and proline, and more arginine and aspartic acid than cereal proteins.',
  'Buckwheat proteins also show a strong supplemental effect with other proteins to
    improve the dietary amino acid balance with special biological activities of cholesterol-lowering
    effects, antihypertensition effects, and improving the constipation and obesity
    conditions by acting in a similar way as dietary fiber and interrupting the in
    vivo metabolisms.', 'Besides its high-quality proteins, buckwheat is also rich
    in many rare components that have healing effects on some chronic diseases.',
  'Among these components, the most attractive ones are flavones, flavonoids, phytosterols,
    d-chiro-Inositol, and myo-inositol.', 'In this review we focus on buckwheats general
    physical and chemical properties, rare components, functional effects, metabolic
    engineering of bioactive compounds and trends in the development of functional
    tea from buckwheat in the latest three years.']
