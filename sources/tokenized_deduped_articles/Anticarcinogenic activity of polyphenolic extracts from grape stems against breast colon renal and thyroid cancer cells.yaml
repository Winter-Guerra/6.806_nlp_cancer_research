[A major part of the wineries wastes is composed of grape stems which are discarded
    mainly in open fields and cause environmental problems due mainly to their high
    polyphenolic content., The grape stem extracts use as a source of high added value
    polyphenols presents great interest because this combines a profitable venture
    with environmental protection close to wine-producing zones., 'In the present
    study, at first, the Total Polyphenolic Content and the polyphenolic composition
    of grape stem extracts from four different Greek Vitis vinifera varieties were
    determined by HPLC methods.', 'Afterwards, the grape stem extracts were examined
    for their ability to inhibit growth of colon, breast, renal and thyroid cancer
    cells.', The cancer cells were exposed to the extracts for 72 h and the effects
    on cell growth were evaluated using the SRB assay., "The results indicated that
    all extracts inhibited cell proliferation, with IC50 values of 121-230 \xCE\xBCg/ml,
    121-184 \xCE\xBCg/ml, 175-309 \xCE\xBCg/ml, 159-314 \xCE\xBCg/ml, 180-225 \xCE\xBCg/ml
    and 134-&gt;400 \xCE\xBCg/ml.", 'This is the first study presenting the inhibitory
    activity of grape stem extracts against growth of colon, breast, renal and thyroid
    cancer cells.']
