[': Triterpene glycosides are characteristic secondary metabolites of sea cucumbers.',
  'They have hemolytic, cytotoxic, antifungal, and other biological activities caused
    by membranotropic action.', 'These natural products suppress the proliferation
    of various human tumor cell lines in vitro and, more importantly, intraperitoneal
    administration in rodents of solutions of some sea cucumber triterpene glycosides
    significantly reduces both tumor burden and metastasis.', "The anticancer molecular
    mechanisms include the induction of tumor cell apoptosis through the activation
    of intracellular caspase cell death pathways, arrest of the cell cycle at S or
    G2/M phases, influence on nuclear factors, NF-\u03BAB, and up-down regulation
    of certain cellular receptors and enzymes participating in cancerogenesis, such
    as EGFR, Akt, ERK, FAK, MMP-9 and others.", 'Administration of some glycosides
    leads to a reduction of cancer cell adhesion, suppression of cell migration and
    tube formation in those cells, suppression of angiogenesis, inhibition of cell
    proliferation, colony formation and tumor invasion.', 'As a result, marked growth
    inhibition of tumors occurs in vitro and in vivo.', Some holothurian triterpene
    glycosides have the potential to be used as P-gp mediated MDR reversal agents
    in combined therapy with standard cytostatics., "triterpene glycosides; sea cucumbers;
    antitumor activities; apoptosis; arrest of cell cycle \n\n\n\nSea cucumbers, belonging
    to the class Holothuroidea, are echinoderms phylogenetically related to sea stars,
    sea urchins and sea lilies.", They are habitually found in the benthic areas and
    deep seas around the world., 'They have a leathery skin and an elongated body,
    and many of them are indeed shaped like soft-bodied cucumbers.', This class has
    around 1100 described living species ., Some of them are edible and considered
    as a delicacy in many countries., 'Consequently, sea cucumbers have some commercial
    value and are extensively harvested.', "Sea cucumbers, also called trepang, b\xEAche-de-mer,
    or balate, have been used as food and Asiatic folk medicine.", Ancient Chinese
    medical manuscripts reveal that parts of holothurians can improve human immune
    status enforcing resistance to many diseases and even have an anticancer effect.,
  "That is probably why the popular Chinese name for sea cucumber is haishen, which
    means, roughly, \u201Cginseng of the sea\u201D because ginseng, a plant belonging
    to the family Araliaceae, has similar medicinal properties .", 'On the other hand,
    many holothurians, particularly tropical species, are toxic.', 'Toxins are elaborated
    in the body wall and in the skin and may be released into the sea water continuously,
    or only when the animal is molested .', Aborigines of Guam and other regions of
    the Indo-Pacific used some holothurians to poison small lagoons of coral reefs
    at low tide for killing fish ., 'The low molecular weight compounds, triterpene
    glycosides, have long been suggested the main poisonous substances of the sea
    cucumbers and to play a role in the defense of holothuroids as a toxin against
    predators and pathogens .', The lanostane triterpene glycosides are characteristic
    of sea cucumbers., The majority of them have 18(20)-lactones in aglycone and belong
    to the holostane series., "Their carbohydrate chains have from two to six monosaccharide
    residues including glucose, quinovose, xylose, and 3-O-methylglucose and sometimes
    6-\u041E-acetylglucose, 3-O-methylxylose, 3-\u041E-methylglucuronic acid, and
    3-\u041E-methylquinovose.", Carbohydrate chains may have from one to three sulfate
    groups ., These compounds have a wide range of pharmacological properties., 'During
    the last decade, several reviews on the study of the cytotoxic activity of triterpene
    glycosides have been published.', These surveys have shown a correlation between
    the structure of triterpenoid saponins and its cytotoxic activity related to the
    molecular mechanisms of action ., 'Most of the glycosides have cytotoxic, hemolytic,
    antifungal, and similar biological activities caused by membranotropic action
    at milli- and micromolar concentrations.', 'The membranotropic action of the glycosides
    is caused by their ability to attach to cell membranes and form nonselective ion-conducting
    complexes with 5(6)-unsaturated sterol, preferably with cholesterol, followed
    by an efflux of some ions, nucleotides, and peptides.', The following breaking
    of ion homeostasis and osmolarity results in cell lysis and death ., 'In addition
    to cytotoxic properties, these glycosides block egg cleavage and development of
    sea urchin embryos, inhibit the growth of pathogenic fungi and proliferation of
    some types of human tumor cells in vitro such as U-87-MG, HCT-8, leukemia P-388,
    KB, Schabel, Mel-28, A-549, MICF-1, HT-29, IA9, CAKI-1, SK-MEL, PC-3, lymphoidal
    leukemia L 1210, MCF-7, MKN-28, HCT-116, U87MG, HepG2, HeLa, THP-1, KB-VIN, HCT-8,
    C33A, and some others .', 'In recent years, holothurian triterpene glycosides
    have attracted the attention of experimental oncologists as potential anticancer
    natural compounds.', The current review summarizes the recent data on anticancer
    activity of sea cucumber triterpene glycosides and some aspects of their molecular
    mechanisms upon cancer cells., 'The first anticancer properties of the sea cucumber
    glycoside, holothurin, representing the glycoside fraction of Bahamian sea cucumber
    Actinopyga agassizi, were described in 1952 by Nigrelli .', 'He showed that the
    injection of holothurin, which is a mixture of triterpene glycosides containing
    as a main constituent holothurin A, in the region of Sarcoma-180, inhibited tumor
    growth and caused its regression in mice.', Later investigations of holothurin
    have shown promise in the field of cancer research., 'Thus, the injection of Krebs-2
    ascitic tumor cells treated with holothurin into healthy mice failed to induce
    marked tumor growth for up to 80 days .', 'In addition, holothurin was shown to
    inhibit the growth of epidermal carcinoma tumor cells .', 'Later, more in-depth
    studies of the mechanisms of glycoside antitumor action were conducted.', 'Thus,
    new triterpene glycosides, philinopsides A, B, E and F, as well as pentactasides
    I, II and III have been isolated from the sea cucumber Pentacta quadrangularis.',
  "All the glycosides revealed significant cytotoxicities in vitro against such tumor
    cell lines as U87MG, A-549, P-388, MCF-7, HCT-116, and MKN-28 with IC50 in the
    range of 0.60\u20133.95 \xB5M .", 'In the most extensive research, philinopside
    A, one of the potent cytotoxic glycosides, was shown to have effects upon angiogenesis
    as well as tumor growth.', These effects were assessed in a series of models in
    vitro and in vivo., 'Results showed that due to significant inhibition of three
    important stages of angiogenesis induced by philinopside A, the formation and
    growth of new blood vessels were greatly decreased.', 'At various doses, philinopside
    A induced inhibition of proliferation of human microvascular endothelial cells
    by 98.7%.', 'At the same doses, the glycoside induced the inhibition of HMECs
    migration by 94.1%.', Rat aorta culture assay provides a close imitation of in
    vivo angiogenic processes., "In this model, 2\u201310 \u03BCM philinopside A suppressed
    the formation of new microvessels.", "Additionally, in the chick embryo chorioallantoic
    membrane assay, philinopside A, at 2\u201310 nmol/egg, significantly inhibited
    angiogenesis.", Philinopside A also manifested strong anti-tumor activities both
    in vitro and in vivo., The glycoside reduced the volume of mouse Sarcoma-180 tumor
    by inducing apoptosis of tumor along with tumor-associated endothelial cells.,
  "Studies of the action of philinopside A on the angiogenesis-related receptor tyrosine
    kinases revealed that philinopside A broadly inhibited all tested RTKs, including
    fibroblast growth factor receptor-1, platelet-derived growth factor receptor-\u03B2,
    vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, along with epithelial growth factor
    receptor, at IC50 values ranging from 2.6 to 4.9 \u03BCM.", 'These results suggest
    that philinopside A, because of its inhibition of all the tested RTKs, might prove
    to be an effective inhibitor of RTK, while a lethal dose in mice was only 625
    mg/kg orally .', 'Recently, anti-tumor and anti-angiogenesis activities of philinopside
    E, a sulfated saponin from sea cucumber Pentacta quadrangularis, were examined.',
  'Inhibition of angiogenesis was assessed in vitro using proliferation, migration,
    adhesion, tube-formation and apoptosis assays in philinopside E-treated human
    dermal microvascular endothelial cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells.',
  "The results showed that philinopside E inhibited proliferation of dermal microvascular
    endothelial cells and umbilical vein endothelial cells with IC50 values of 2.22
    \xB1 0.31 \u03BCM and 1.98 \xB1 0.32 \u03BCM, respectively.", "This glycoside
    induced the apoptosis of endothelial cells at concentrations ;2 \u03BCM, dose-dependent
    suppression of cell migration, adhesion of cells and formation of tubes in those
    cells, and revealed anti-proliferative activities against a series of tumor cell
    lines.", Philinopside E suppressed spontaneous angiogenesis in the chorioallantoic
    membrane assay in vivo and induced significant inhibition of growth in mouse Hepatoma-22
    and Sarcoma-180 cell models., 'Specifically, philinopside E reduced the tumor
    volume of mouse Sarcoma-180 by triggering apoptosis of both tumor and tumor-associated
    endothelial cells, preferentially of endothelial cells over tumor cells.', 'Philinopside
    E also suppressed the active forms of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors
    including: KDR/Flk-1, VEGF2 ERK, FAK, paxillin, and Akt.', 'These data indicate
    that philinopside E induces an anti-angiogenic activity associated with inhibition
    of signaling of VEGFR2, and has pronounced anti-tumor activity caused by the decrease
    of proliferation of tumor cells and increase of apoptosis of both tumor and endothelial
    cells .', 'Additionally, it was demonstrated that philinopside E specifically
    interacts with the extracellular domain of kinase insert domain-containing receptor
    and blocks its interaction with VEGF and its downstream signaling.', This specificity
    for the KDR extracellular domain is distinct from conventional small-molecule
    inhibitors that target the KDR cytoplasmic domain., "It was also shown that philinopside
    E significantly suppresses \u03B1v\u03B23 integrin-driven downstream signaling
    caused by a disturbance of the interaction between KDR and \u03B1v\u03B23 integrin
    in HMECs, followed by a disruption of the cytoskeleton organization of actin and
    decreased adhesion of cells to vitronectin .", "Patagonicoside A from Psolus patagonicus
    and its desulfated analogs were studied for their cytotoxic, antiproliferative,
    and hemolytic activities and their influence on NF-\u03BAB activation.", "Both
    substances were able to suppress the growth of three tumor cell lines and induced
    the activation of NF-\u03BAB, a key player linking chronic inflammation and cancer,
    concomitant with IK Ba degradation in the A549 tumor cell line.", "These compounds
    showed hemolytic activity with half maximal inhibitory concentration values around
    80 \u03BCM.", Both glycosides showed low cytotoxic activity in A549 tumor cells
    in comparison with other sea cucumber triterpene glycosides containing linear
    tetrasaccharide chains., This probably is because of the presence of an additional
    sulfate at C-6 of glucose residue., "This also could be a result of the uncommon
    presence of two 12\u03B1- and 17\u03B1-hydroxyl groups and a \u03947 double bond
    in the aglycone moiety .", 'In vitro and in vivo investigations were conducted
    on the effects of Ds-echinoside A, a non-sulfated triterpene glycoside isolated
    from the sea cucumber Pearsonothuria graeffei, on tumor cell adhesion, migration,
    invasion, and angiogenesis.', "In this study, it was found that Ds-echinoside
    A reduced cell viability of human hepatocellular liver carcinoma cells Hep G2,
    with IC50 of 2.65 \u03BCmol/L, and suppressed adhesion, migration, and invasion
    of Hep G2 cells in a concentration-dependent manner.", Ds-echinoside A also decreased
    tube formation of human endothelial cells ECV-304 on matrigel in vitro and attenuated
    neovascularization in the chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane assay in vivo.,
  'Immunocytochemical analysis showed that Ds-echinoside A suppressed matrix metalloproteinase-9
    expression, playing an important role in breaking basement membranes associated
    with angiogenesis and metastasis.', Ds-echinoside A also increased the expression
    of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase-1 regulating activation of MMP-9., "Ds-echinoside
    A also reduced the expressions of vascular endothelial growth factor and NF-\u03BAB
    .", Both echinoside A and Ds-echinoside A significantly arrested the cell cycle
    in the G0/G1 phase., 'A reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay
    showed that glycosides increased the cell-cycle-related genes expression, including
    p16, p21, and c-myc, and decreased the expression of cyclin D1.', 'They decreased
    the expression of Bcl-2, and enhanced mitochondrial cytochrome c release, caspase-3
    activation, and cleavage of adenosine diphosphate ribose polymerase.', "Ds-echinoside
    A significantly decreased Nuclear factor NF-\u03BAB expression, but echinoside
    A was not involved in concerning the expression.", 'Echinoside A and Ds-echinoside
    A induced the reduction of H22 hepatocarcinoma tumor weight by 49.8% and 55.0%,
    respectively .', 'Moreover, it was shown that echinoside A reduced tumor growth
    in mouse and xenografts of human prostate carcinoma in nude mice models.', Echinoside
    A inhibited the noncovalent binding of Top2alpha to DNA by competing with DNA
    for the DNA-binding domain and by interfering predominantly with the Top2alpha-mediated
    prestrand passage cleavage/religation equilibrium over with the poststrand passage.,
  These characteristics distinguish echinoside A from known Top2alpha inhibitors.,
  'Hence, echinoside A induced DNA double-strand breaks in a Top2-dependent manner
    .', 'Similar results were obtained by the authors in an earlier study of two sulfated
    triterpene glycosides, namely, holothurin A and 24-dehydroechinoside A, from the
    sea cucumber Pearsonothuria graeffei.', Both of these glycosides exhibited significant
    inhibition of metastasis in vitro and in vivo., 'Immunocytochemical analysis revealed
    that both compounds significantly decreased the expression of MMP-9 and enhanced
    the expression level of tissue inhibitors of TIMP-1, an important regulator of
    MMP-9 activation.', 'According to the results of Western blot analysis, both chemicals
    remarkably abolished the expression of VEGF.', "In contrast, the treatment of
    24-dehydroechinoside had no effect on the down regulation of NF-\u03BAB expression
    and considerably reduced the adhesion of HepG2 to both matrigel and ECV-304 and
    also inhibited HepG2 cell migration and invasion in a concentration-dependent
    manner.", 24-dehydroechinoside more effectively induced antimetastasis than holothurin
    A., "Moreover, only holothurin A downregulated the expression of NF-\u03BAB.",
  "This suggests that antimetastatic activity of the glycosides of P. graeffei can
    be either NF-\u03BAB-dependent or -independent, depending on glycoside chemical
    structure .", It was found that the colochiroside A from the sea cucumber Colochirus
    anceps remarkably exhibited antineoplastic activities in vitro and in vivo and
    did not reduce the immunoregulatory function of mice., "The preliminary cytotoxic
    assay of colochiroside A revealed significant cytotoxic activity against six types
    of cultured tumor cell lines of P-388, HL60, A-549, SpC-A4, MKN-28, and SGC-7901,
    with a mean IC50 of 3.61 \xB1 0.55 mg/L.", The preliminary anti-tumor assay of
    colochiroside A suggests that this glycoside exhibits strong inhibitory effects
    against H22 liver cancer and S180 sarcoma cells in mice., 'The maximal inhibition
    ratio to H22 liver cancer was 52.2%, while the ratio to S180 sarcoma was 70.0%.',
  The immunoregulatory study indicated that colochiroside A has no significant effect
    on the developments of thymus and spleen ., 'Intercedensides A, B, and C from
    Mensamaria intercedens exhibited cytotoxicity against human tumor cell lines.',
  'One of them, intercedenside A, also revealed good antineoplastic activity against
    mouse Lewis lung cancer and mouse S180 sarcoma .', 'Okhotosides B1, B2 and B3
    from Cucumaria okhotensis were moderately toxic against cells of HeLa tumor.',
  Frondoside A isolated from the same holothurian revealed more potent cytotoxicity
    against THP-1 and against HeLa tumor cells., "This substance decreased both the
    AP-1-dependent trascriptional activities induced by UVB, EGF, or TPA in JB6-LucAP-1
    cells and the EGF-induced NF-\u03BAB-dependent transcriptional activity in JB6-LucNF-\u03BAB
    cells at doses of about 1 \u03BCg/mL.", Frondoside A increased the p53-dependent
    transcriptional activity in nonactivated JB6-Lucp53 cells at the same doses.,
  It also inhibited the colony formation of JB6 P Cl 41 cells activated with EGF .,
  The tumor suppressing and pro-apoptotic activity of the different water-soluble
    holothurian glycoside fractions from Apostichopus japonicus were examined., 'The
    70% ethanol fraction from macroporous resin column and the pSC-2 and pSC-3 fractions
    from a silica gel column showed very strong tumor suppressing activity towards
    HeLa cells, A-549 lung cancer cells, SGC-7901 stomach cancer cells, and Bel-7402
    liver cancer cells.', 'SC-2 and SC-3 fraction purified by Sephadex LH-20 gel-filtration
    column chromatography, with purity above 99.6%, all had the properties of triterpenoid
    glycosides.', 'Purified SC-2 fractions had remarkable tumor suppressing activity
    on HeLa cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner, and had prominent tumor suppressing
    activity on mouse S180 solid tumors in a dose-dependent manner.', 'Additionally,
    the SC-2 fraction also had a remarkable ability to elevate mouse thymus and spleen
    indexes.', The purified SC-2 fraction induced apoptosis of HeLa cells in a dose-dependent
    manner and DNA fragmentation of HeLa cells occurred after 12 h treatment with
    10 mg/L and 50 mg/L of SC-2 fractions ., Stichoposide C from the holothurian Thelenota
    anax was examined for elucidation of possible mechanisms by which it induces apoptosis
    of cancer cells., Stichoposide C-induced apoptosis in human leukemia and colorectal
    cancer cells were examined in the context of mitochondrial injury and signaling
    pathway disturbances., 'Additionally, the antitumor effects of stichoposide C
    in mouse CT-26 subcutaneous tumors and HL-60 leukemia xenograft models were investigated.',
  'It was found that stichoposide C induced apoptosis in these cells in a dose-dependent
    manner leading to the activation of Fas and caspase-8, cleavage of Bid, mitochondrial
    damage, and caspase-3 activation.', 'Stichoposide C activated neutral SMase and
    acid sphingomyelinase, resulting in ceramide generation.', 'The knockdown experiments
    concerning specific inhibition of neutral SMase or acid SMase and siRNA partially
    blocked apoptosis induced by stichoposide C. Moreover, the glycoside significantly
    decreased growth of HL-60 xenograft tumors and CT-26 subcutaneous tumors and increased
    generation of ceramide in vivo.', 'The authors concluded that ceramide generation
    by stichoposide C because of the activation of neutral and acid SMase, may contribute
    to the apoptosis and the antitumor activity induced by stichoposide C .', Significant
    contribution to the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of antitumor actions
    of triterpene glycosides has been made in the study of frondoside A and its analogs
    isolated from the sea cucumber Cucumaria frondosa., 'Chemopreventive efficacy
    of Frondanol A5, a preparation from C. frondosa which contains several sea cucumber-derived
    anticancer and antiinflamatory agents including the triterpene glycoside frondoside
    A, was evaluated on azoxymethane-induced rat colon carcinogenesis using colonic
    aberrant crypt foci as a surrogate biomarker.', 'Rats were fed the AIN-76A diet
    containing 5% corn oil, and ACFs were induced by azoxymethane.', 'Three days after
    azoxymethane treatment, rats were fed with diets containing Frondanol A5.', 'It
    was shown that dietary administration of 150 and 450 ppm of Frondanol A5 markedly
    decreased total colonic ACF formation induced by azoxymethane, approximately 34%
    to 55%, and multicrypt aberrant foci depending on the dosage.', ACFs in rats treated
    with Frondanol A5 revealed marked up-regulation of p21WAF1/CIP1 and down-regulation
    of proliferating cell nuclear antigen., Frondanol A5 revealed inhibition of the
    growth at S and G2/M phases along with a decrease in Cdc25c and an increase in
    p21WAF1/CIP along with significant apoptosis caused by H2AX phosphorylation and
    the cleavage of caspase-2 in HCT116 cells., The authors concluded that Frondanol
    A5 exhibits potential chemopreventive properties for colon carcinogenesis ., A
    polar precipitate sub-fraction of Frondanol A5 was examined for anti-cancer effects
    in S2013 and AsPC-1 human pancreatic cancer cell lines., 'Frondanol-A5P inhibited
    cell proliferation and induced cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase in both cell lines
    with decreased expression of cdc25c, cyclin A, and cyclin B. Frondanol-A5P also
    induced phosphorylation of Janus kinase and stress-activated protein kinase along
    with p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase during 5 min and markedly increased
    expression of p21waf1 messenger RNA and protein at 3 h in both cell lines.', 'This
    effect was decreased by the inhibitor of p38 kinase, SB203580.', Frondanol-A5P
    also significantly increased annexin V binding and caspase-3 activation ., It
    was established that individual frondoside A from Cucumaria frondosa inhibited
    cell proliferation of AsPC-1 human pancreatic cancer in a concentration- and time-dependent
    manner., 'In concert with inhibition of cell growth, frondoside A induced significant
    morphological changes consistent with apoptosis.', 'Its activity led to an increase
    of sub-G0/G1 apoptotic cells population, a decrease in expression of Bcl-2 and
    Mcl-1, an increase in Bax expression, an increase in the expression of the cyclin-dependent
    kinase inhibitor, p21, and activation of caspases 3, 7, and 9.', These data revealed
    that frondoside A induced apoptosis of human pancreatic cancer cells via the mitochondrial
    pathway and activation of the caspase cascade., Frondoside A inhibited growth
    of AsPC-1 in xenograft mouse models ., The impact of frondoside A on human breast
    cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 was compared to the effect on a non-tumorigenic MCF10-A
    cell line derived from normal human mammary epithelium., "The glycoside decreased
    breast cancer cell viability in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, with
    EC50 of 2.5 \u03BCM at 24 h. MCF10-A cells were more resistant to the cytotoxic
    action .", Frondoside A significantly increased sub-G1 cell fractions by the activation
    of p53 followed by the appearance of caspases 9 and 3/7 cell death pathways in
    the MDA-MB-231 cells., 'Moreover, frondoside A induced inhibition of MDA-MB-231
    cell migration and invasion in concentration-dependent manner.', "Frondoside A,
    at the dosage of 100 \u03BCg/kg/day intraperitoneal for 24 days, effectively decreased
    the growth of tumor xenografts in athymic mice in vivo without toxic-side action.",
  Frondoside A also increased the anti-proliferative activity of paclitaxel in such
    breast cancer models ., It was shown that frondoside A possesses potent antimetastatic
    activity on syngenic murine model of metastatic breast cancer., 'Upon intraperitoneal
    administration to mice with mammary gland-implanted tumors, Frondoside A inhibited
    spontaneous tumor metastasis in the lungs.', 'The increase of cyclooxygenase-2
    activity promotes tumor growth and metastasis by producing high levels of PGE2
    that acts on the receptors of prostaglandin E, mainly EP4 and EP2.', Frondoside
    A antagonizes the receptors EP2 and EP4 of prostaglandin E. Frondoside A inhibited
    3H-PGE2 binding to recombinant EP2 or EP4-expressing cells at a high concentration
    that may be caused by cytotoxic effects., 'Moreover, frondoside A also inhibited
    EP4 or EP2-linked activation of intracellular cAMP along with EP4-mediated ERK1/2
    activation.', "Along with the antimetastatic activity found in vivo, frondoside
    A at concentrations 0.1 and 1.0 \u03BCM also inhibited migration of tumor cells
    in vitro in response to EP4 or EP2 agonists .", 'The effects of Frondoside A on
    the human non-small lung cancer cell LNM35 survival, migration, and invasion in
    vitro, and on tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis alone, and in combination
    with cisplatin in vivo were investigated.', 'Frondoside A induced a concentration-dependent
    decrease in viability of MCF-7, NCI-H460-Luc2, A549, MDA-MB-435, HepG2, and LNM35
    over 24 h along with a caspase 3/7-dependent pathway of cell death.', "The IC50
    concentrations of frondoside A at 24 h were 0.7\u20132.5 \u03BCM.", 'Frondoside
    A also induced an inhibition of the migration of cells, angiogenesis, and invasion
    in vitro in time- and concentration- dependent mode.', 'Frondoside A strongly
    decreased the growth, angiogenesis, and lymph node metastasis of LNM35 tumor xenografts
    in athymic mice, without toxic side effects.', "This glycoside in concentrations
    between 0.1 and 0.5 \u03BCM also significantly blocked basal and bFGF induced
    angiogenesis in the chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane model of angiogenesis
    assay.", 'Moreover, frondoside A enhanced lung tumor growth inhibition by the
    chemotherapeutic agent cisplatin .', 'The anti-invasive activity and anti-metastatic
    effects of this glycoside at non-cytotoxic concentrations against a human breast
    cancer cell line were investigated along with the inhibitory effect on cell invasion,
    clonogenicity, and migration in TPA-stimulated cells of human breast cancer.',
  'Frondoside A significantly decreased TPA-induced colony formation, migration and
    invasion in MBA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells.', It was shown that MMP-9 induction
    is very important for the metastasis of different types of cancer tumor cells.,
  'It was also found that this glycoside suppresses TPA-induced enzymatic activity
    of MMP-9, its secretion and expression.', "This effect was caused by a reduction
    of the activation of AP-1 and NF-\u03BAB.", It also correlated with an increase
    of TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 expression., "Frondoside A inhibited the expression of TPA-induced
    MMP-9, probably because of the suppression of NF-\u03BAB and AP-1 signaling pathways.",
  'The glycoside decreases the activation of the PI3K/Akt, ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK signals.',
  "These data suggest that frondoside A anti-metastatic effects on human breast cancer
    cells may be caused by the inhibitin of TPA activation of AP-1 and NF-\u03BAB
    and a decrease of TPA activation of ERK1/2, PI3K/Akt and p38 MAPK signals leading
    to downregulation of the expression of MMP-9.", Such results revealed the role
    of frondoside A in metastasis and its underlying molecular mechanisms., These
    data also suggest frondoside A may be used as a chemopreventive agent for metastatic
    breast cancer ., 'The estrogenic potency of holothurin A, holotoxin A1, frondoside
    A, cucumarioside A2-2 and a semi-synthesized plant glycoside, ginsenoside-Rh2,
    were studied using a yeast two-hybrid system including expressed genes of human
    estrogen receptor, hERalpha, the co-activator TIF2 and lacZ as a reporter gene.',
  "It was found that only ginsenoside-Rh2 had moderate estrogenic activity in a concentration
    range between 10\u22127 and 10\u22126 M. The effect was about 30% of the activity
    of 17beta-estradiol at half-effective concentration.", 'Hence, ginsenosides-Rh2
    is a weak phytoestrogen.', 'Holothurin A, cucumarioside A2-2, holotoxin A1 and
    frondoside A did not interact with estrogen receptors and had no appreciable estrogenic
    activity.', These results showed that the anticancer effect of tested holothurian
    glycosides upon ER-positive breast cancer cells does not involve glycoside binding
    to estrogen receptors., Ginsenoside-Rh2 has some similarity in chemical structure
    with 17beta-estradiol., It might explain the affinity of this glycoside to the
    hER receptors ., 'Frondoside A influenced the anti-cancer effects of gemcitabine,
    the standard drug in antitumor therapy, against human pancreatic cancer cell lines,
    AsPC-1 and S2013.', The combinations of low concentrations of these preparations
    were used for a 72 h treatment period in vitro., Synergetic growth inhibition
    was significantly greater than their separate effects., Combinations of gemcitabine
    and glycosides were tested in vivo on the nude mouse model., Xenografts of AsPC-1
    and S2013 cells form the tumors before the dministration of the drugs alone or
    in combination for 30 days., Tumors grew quickly in control mice., The growth
    was significantly decreased in all treatment groups., 'Gemcitabine, combined with
    the glycoside was more effective than the use of either drug alone.', It was suggested
    that combinations of frondoside A and gemcitabine may provide clinical benefits
    for patients with pancreatic cancer ., Sea cucumber triterpene glycosides with
    differing chemical structures were examined in vitro for effects against leukemia
    cell lines., "Cucumariosides A2-2 and A4-2 from Cucumaria japonica and stichoposides
    \u0421 and D from Thelenota anax, in cytotoxic doses, were shown to induce apoptosis
    in human leukemia cells HL-60, THP-1, NB-4 and K562 in vitro by a caspase-dependent
    mechanism.", 'Thus, sea cucumber triterpene glycosides, in spite of differing
    molecular structures, may nonetheless have generalized therapeutic relevance for
    human cancer .', 'The effects of frondoside A from C. frondosa, cucumarioside
    A2-2, and cucumarioside A4-2 from C. japonica on cell death-inducing capability
    were compared.', These glycosides significantly induced apoptosis of leukemic
    cells., The apoptosis induced by frondoside A was more potent and rapid than apoptosis
    induced by cucumarioside A2-2., 'Mitohondrial membrane permeability was not changed
    and accumulation of cytochrome C in the cytosolic fraction was not found in HL-60
    cells treated with frondoside A, cucumarioside A2-2 and cucumarioside A4-2.',
  "More interestingly, the level of procaspase-3, -8, and -9 proteins in lysates from
    frondoside A-treated HL-60 cells were not changed, whereas frondoside A-induced
    apoptosis in 50%\u201370% of the cells.", 'Cleavage of procaspase-3 and PARP,
    but not of procaspase-8, -9, and -12, were significantly increased in cucumarioside
    A2-2 or cucumarioside A4-2 treated HL-60 cells.', 'Furthermore, the annexin-V
    positivity in cells treated by fronfdoside A was not inhibited by zVAD-fmk.',
  'Nevertheless, both annexin-V positivity and cleavage of caspases induced by cucumariosides
    were efficiently suppressed by caspase inhibitors.', 'This suggests that holothurian
    triterpene glycosides may induce apoptosis of leukemic cells caspase-dependently
    or independently, depending on the glycoside structure .', 'In another investigation,
    the cytotoxicity of cucumarioside A2-2 and its effect upon apoptosis, the cell
    cycle, DNA biosynthesis and p53 activity, and glycoside anticancer action against
    mouse Ehrlich carcinoma cells were studied.', It was found that the glycoside
    influences viability of tumor cells at micromolar concentrations., "The EC50 for
    glycoside found by non specific esterase assay and MTT assay was 2.1 and 2.7 \u03BCM,
    respectively.", The glycoside at sub-cytotoxic range of concentrations revealed
    a cytostatic effect by blocking the proliferation of cells and biosynthesis of
    DNA in the S phase., Cucumarioside A2-2 may induce apoptosis in cells of Ehrlich
    carcinoma along with caspase-dependent ways by passing activation of p53-dependent
    segments., It was concluded that the anticancer and pro-apoptotic properties of
    the glycoside may be caused by interaction of cucumarioside A2-2 with tumor cells.,
  The anticancer effect of cucumarioside A2-2 in vivo may be caused by the ability
    of the substance to arrest the cell cycle in the DNA synthetic phase and induce
    programmed death of tumor cells ., 'Additionally, it was found that in non-cytotoxic
    concentrations of frondoside A and cucumarioside A2-2, as well as their complexes
    with cholesterol, block the activity of membrane transport P-glycoprotein.', This
    protein is responsible for multidrug resistance phenomena in cells of the ascite
    form of mouse Ehrlich carcinoma., 'In this way, glycosides prevent an efflux of
    fluorescent probe Calcein from the cells.', 'Cucumarioside A2-2 was found to increase
    the upload and intracellular concentration of cytostatic doxorubicine, and prevent
    an efflux of anticancer drugs from the cancer cells.', 'Because the interaction
    of the glycosides with tumor cells resulted in a decrease of MDR, these glycosides
    are potential inhibitors of multidrug resistance and can be used in combined therapy
    of cancer .', 'As a result of long-term investigations, a new immunomodulatory
    lead Cumaside with antitumor properties was invented on the base of triterpene
    glycosides isolated from Far Eastern sea cucumber Cucumaria japonica.', 'Cumaside
    is a complex of monosulfated glycosides with cholesterol in molar ratio of 1:2
    .', 'Recently, it was found that Cumaside possesses less cytotoxic action against
    sea urchin embryos and cells of Ehrlich carcinoma than the glycosides.', 'Furthermore,
    Cumaside posessed antitumor activity against experimental mouse Ehrlich carcinoma
    in vivo both alone and in combination with cytostatics.', 'The highest result
    was achieved at a treatment of once per day for seven days before the tumor inoculation,
    followed by Cumaside treatment once per day for seven days.', The treatment along
    with prophylactic schemes with Cumaside and subsequent therapeutic application
    of 5-fluorouracil inhibited tumor growth by 43% ., 'Recently, the ability of a
    number of cytotoxic triterpene glycosides from sea cucumbers to interact with
    human topoisomerase II alpha has been investigated in silico using the methods
    of computer simulation.', "This study revealed possible anticancer effects of
    a series of triterpen glycosides including bivittoside A, holothurin A, holotoxin
    A, holothurinoside A, and cucumarioside A2-2 using homology modeling of human
    DNA topo II \u03B1.", "The authors have found the possible binding site of DNA
    binding domain of Topo II \u03B1.", These glycosides were screened for QSAR and
    ADME/TOX analysis as ligands., All the glycosides were able to bind with the enzyme.,
  Binding sites have been established for all the glycosides., All the tested glycosides
    had a model of antitumor effects., "According to this study, cucumarioside A2-2
    may be a better inhibitor of topo II \u03B1 and follow most of the ADME properties
    .", "The authors explain the inhibition by the interaction of \u201Cphenolic principals\u201D
    of the glycosides with amino acids of the active center of the enzyme by hydrogen
    bonds.", This seems to be an erroneous explanation because the glycosides do not
    contain phenolic groups., It is possible that the authors have confused pyranose
    forms of monosaccharide residues with phenols., A brief amount of information
    concerning the molecular mechanisms of the biological action of certain sea cucumber
    triterpene glycosides was collected recently in a review ., 'This review highlights
    the structural characteristics and mechanisms of the action of marine triterpene
    glycosides, such as stichoposides, frondoside A, and cucumariosides.', 'In particular,
    the membranotropic and membranolytic activities of glycosides from sea cucumbers
    and their ability to induce cytotoxicity and apoptosis had been discussed, with
    a focus on structure-activity relationships.', 'Membrane transporters, which are
    modulated by triterpene glycosides and thus can be proposed as potential therapeutic
    targets, were summarized.', "These include Na+-K+-ATPase and Ca2+-ATPase in the
    sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum, L-type voltage-gated calcium channels, transient
    receptor potential canonical channels, ryanodine receptor, voltage-gated Na+ channels,
    K+ channel, calcium-activated K+ channel, human Ether-\xE0-go-go Related Gene,
    K+ channels, N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors,
    as well as \u03B3-amino butyric acid receptors.", 'In addition, the structural
    characteristics and antitumor effects of some sea cucumber glycosides have been
    reviewed along with underlying their molecular mechanisms.', 'Moreover, in recent
    review, the mechanisms of the anticancer effects of triterpene glycosides, frondoside
    A and cucumarioside A2-2, were summarized with specific emphasis on the apoptotic
    activity of the glycosides and its effect on metastasis and invasion of cancer
    cells .', The authors concluded that these glycosides may be considered to be
    both anticancer and cancer preventive agents., Frondoside A and cucumarioside
    A2-2 both posses anti-leukemic properties by inducing apoptosis., 'Moreover, the
    anticancer effects of frondoside A and cucumarioside A2-2 might be through inhibition
    of tumorigenesis and metastasis.', The mechanisms are not clear and may be found
    in the future., Frondoside A will be useful as a caspase-independent anti-leukemic
    agent in order to overcome chemoresistance associated with a defect in both the
    extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways., 'As a next step, the determination
    of the structural characteristics responsible for the in vivo anticancer activities
    will be essential for their use as a drug.', 'In addition, oral administration
    of frondoside A and cucumariosides was recommended by authors in clinical trials.',
  'In the last few decades, scientific literature from several countries has reported
    that, indeed, triterpene glycosides from sea cucumbers do have a wide spectrum
    of biological effects including cytotoxic, hemolytic, antifungal, ichthiotoxic,
    and other activities.', It has been shown that a majority of these activities
    are based on the interaction of these compounds with membrane sterols., "Most
    triterpene glycosides of sea cucumbers have strong membranotropic action against
    any cellular and model membranes containing \u03945-sterols.", "This interaction
    with biomembrane \u03945-sterols results in pore formation, changes in membrane
    viscosity and ion permeability, inhibition of some membrane enzymes and others
    that lead finally to death of the cells.", 'Simultaneously, some sea cucumber
    triterpene glycosides exhibit pronounced anticancer effects by direct interaction
    with tumor cells in the sub-cytotoxic range of concentration.', 'The summarized
    data of sea cucumber triterpene glycoside effects upon cancer cell viability,
    cell cycle/proliferation, apoptosis, migration/metastasis, angiogenesis and tumor
    growth in vivo are presented in the Table 1.', 'Basically, the detailed mechanism(s)
    of the anticancer activities of these glycosides still remain largely unclear.',
  "However, the general details of this mechanism may be reduced to the following
    points:\n\n(a) induction of tumor cell apoptosis was shown to be one of the primary
    causative factors through the activation of intracellular caspase cell death pathways;\n\n(b)
    arrest of the cell cycle at S or G2/M phases and increase of the sub-G0/G1 cell
    population which leads to the block of proliferation and apoptosis;\n\n(c) regulation
    of nuclear factor NF-\u03BAB, a key player linking chronic inflammation and cancer;\n\n(d)
    regulation of certain cellular receptors and enzymes participating in cancerogenesis,
    such as: EGFR; AKt; ERK; FAK; and MMP-9 and some others.", 'Finally, administration
    of some sea cucumber triterpene glycosides leads to reduction in cancer cell adhesion,
    suppression of cell migration and tube formation in those cells, suppression of
    angiogenesis, inhibition of cell proliferation, colony formation and tumor invasion,
    and, as a result, marked growth inhibition of tumors in vitro and in vivo.', "Additionally,
    some holothurians\u2019 triterpene glycosides have the potential to be used as
    P-gp mediated MDR reversal agents in combined anticancer therapy with standard
    cytostatics.", This work was particularly supported by the Grant of RFBR No.,
