[Dietary lipids can modify the clinical behavior and morphological features of experimental
    breast tumors., "We previously demonstrated that a high corn oil diet has a tumor-enhancing
    effect in 7,12-dimethylbenz(\u03B1)anthracene-induced rat mammary adenocarcinomas,
    whereas a high olive oil diet acts as a negative modulator of carcinogenesis.",
  'In this study, we investigated whether these high fat diets modulate the expression
    of genes related to differentiation.', 'Rats were induced with DMBA and fed a
    low fat diet, a high corn oil diet, a high olive oil diet, or both high fat diets.',
  "The expression levels of the mammary differentiation biomarkers \u03B1-casein,
    \u03B2-casein and transferrin and of \u03B2-actin and its transporter zipcode
    binding protein 1 were analyzed by Northern and/or Western blot in the mammary
    adenocarcinomas.", 'The high fat diets did not induce changes in the expression
    of caseins, while transferrin expression was increased as a result of the high
    olive oil diet.', "\u03B2-actin mRNA levels were higher in the high fat diet groups,
    though no changes in the protein levels were observed.", 'The expression of ZBP1,
    a protein reported as having a role in carcinogenesis, was significantly increased
    by the high corn oil diet.', These results suggest that in this model caseins
    are not good biomarkers of the changes in tumor morphological differentiation
    conferred by the high fat diets., The modulation of transferrin and ZBP1 expression
    by the high olive oil and the high corn oil diets could be one of the mechanisms
    by which such diets have a different influence on mammary carcinogenesis.]
