[Many studies have found links between diet and cancer., The summary estimates of
    the association between dietary factors and cancer risk were investigated using
    previously reported studies of the Korean population., 'Gastric cancer risk was
    inversely associated with the high intake of soy foods , allium vegetables , fruits
    , and mushrooms .', Salt and Kimchi were associated with an increased gastric
    cancer risk ., Colorectal cancer risk was positively associated with meat intake
    ., 'Total soy products, soybean curd, and soymilk showed an inverse association
    with breast cancer risk .', Green/yellow and light colored vegetables were associated
    with a reduced risk of breast cancer ., Mushroom intake was inversely associated
    in pre-menopausal women only ., 'In conclusion, soy foods, fruits and vegetables
    might reduce cancer risk in the Korean population.', 'High salt food might be
    risk factor for gastric cancer, and intake of high amount of meat might cause
