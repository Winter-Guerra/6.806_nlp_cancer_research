['This study describes the occurrence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in smoked
    tea and tea infusions, via the monitoring of benzo(a)anthracene, chrysene, benzo(b)fluoranthene
    and benzo(a)pyrene that have been chosen as indicators for the occurrence of PAHs
    in food by the European Food Safety Agency.', "The concentrations ranged from
    1.2 \xCE\xBCg/kg for benzo(b)fluoranthene to 125.0 \xCE\xBCg/kg for benzo(a)anthracene
    in smoked tea leaves, and from 0.6 \xCE\xBCg/L for benzo(a)anthracene to 1.2 \xCE\xBCg/L
    for benzo(b)fluoranthene in smoked tea infusions.", Benzo(a)pyrene was never detected
    in infusions., "The concentrations in non-smoked tea leaves ranged from 0.6 \xCE\xBCg/kg
    for benzo(a)anthracene to 10.8 \xCE\xBCg/kg for benzo(b)fluoranthene.", It was
    shown that the concentrations of benzo(a)anthracene and chrysene were higher in
    smoked tea than in non-smoked tea while no difference was observed for benzo(b)fluoranthene
    and benzo(a)pyrene., 'The concentrations of PAHs in tea infusions are low compared
    to other foodstuffs, but the migration rates from leaves into water are high.']
