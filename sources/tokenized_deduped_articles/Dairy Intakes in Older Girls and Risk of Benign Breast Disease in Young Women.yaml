['Previous investigations found high dairy intakes in girls associated with rapid
    height growth and excess weight gain, which had opposite relationships with benign
    breast disease in young women.', 'We use data from the longitudinal Growing Up
    Today Study to investigate whether dairy intakes, in older children/adolescents,
    are associated with BBD risk in young women.', "GUTS includes 9,039 females, ages
    9\u201315 years in 1996, who completed questionnaires annually through 2001, then
    in 2003, 2005, 2007, and 2010.", 'Dietary food frequencies obtained milk, yogurt,
    and cheese intakes.', "On 2005\u20132010 surveys, 7,011 females reported whether
    a health care provider ever diagnosed them with BBD and if confirmed by breast
    biopsy.", 'Logistic regression models estimated associations between prevalent
    biopsy-confirmed BBD and dairy intakes, adjusted for age and energy.', 'Multivariable-adjusted
    models additionally included menarche age, childhood adiposity, adolescent alcohol
    consumption, and pregnancy.', Further analyses stratified by family history.,
  "Age-energy\u2013adjusted models of dairy intakes at 14 yr found no significant
    associations with BBD risk [milk: OR, 0.90/(serving/d); 95% confidence interval,
    0.76\u20131.05; dairy protein: OR, 0.98/(10 g/d); 95% CI, 0.82\u20131.17).", 'Separate
    analyses of dairy intakes at 10 yr, intakes before the growth spurt, during the
    growth spurt, before menses-onset, and after menses-onset provided no significant
    associations with BBD.', 'Multivariable adjustment, and family history stratification,
    did not alter the above findings.', We conclude that dairy intakes by older girls
    have no strong relation with BBD risk in young women., 'Because of small number
    of cases, it is important to continue follow-up and re-examine later.', "Cancer
