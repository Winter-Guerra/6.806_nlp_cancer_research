['Two novel tetralone dimers, with an O-bridge, named juglanones A and B, were isolated
    from the AcOEt extract of walnut pericarps.', These compounds are the first examples
    of O-bridged dimeric tetralones., 'Their structures were determined by spectroscopic
    methods, including HR-TOF-MS, and 1D- and 2D-NMR.', Biological evaluation of these
    two isolates against a number of human cancer cell lines is also described.]
