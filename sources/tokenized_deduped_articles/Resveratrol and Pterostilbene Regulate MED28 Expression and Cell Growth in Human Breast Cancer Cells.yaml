['Resveratrol and pterostilbene, found in grapes and berries, among other plants,
    exhibit numerous biological roles and putative chemotherapeutic effects.', 'MED28,
    a Mediator subunit for transcriptional activation, is highly expressed in several
    types of tumor including breast cancer.', 'Recently,we have reported that MED28
    regulates cellular migration and invasion in human breast cancer cells, and resveratrol
    can inhibit the effect.', In the current study we investigated the effect of resveratrol
    and pterostilbene on MED28 expression and cell growth in human breast cancer cells.,
  'When MED28 is overexpressed by ectopic expression or induced by epidermal growth
    factor, resveratrol and pterostilbene may suppress MED28-associated cell growth.',
  'Resveratrol and pterostilbene appeared to suppress cell growth, at least partially,
    by reducing the expression of MED28 and cyclin D1 as well as mediating the transcriptional
    activity of NFkB.', This finding may eventually result in clinical application
    as to integrate resveratrol and pterostilbene into adjuvant regimen in cancer
    treatment.]
