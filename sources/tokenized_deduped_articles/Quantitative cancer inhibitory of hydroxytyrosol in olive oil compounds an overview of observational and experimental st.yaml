['Hydroxytyrosol, an important phenol present in olives, stands out as a compound
    of high value due to its excellent antioxidant, antimicrobial and anticarcinogenic
    activities.', 'Hydroxytyrosol-1,2-benzendiol)) is one of the main phenolic compounds
    in olives, virgin oil and waste water obtained during the production of olive
    oil.', 'HTyr has been confirmed as the antioxidant with the highest free radical
    scavenging capacity, and is more active than antioxidant vitamins as well as the
    synthetic antioxidants.', 'Studies have shown many beneficial attributes of this
    ortho-diphenol compound, e.g.', anti-inflammatory activity and inhibition of platelet
    aggregation., 'Similar to other polyphenols, HTyr was shown to prevent atherosclerosis
    through the inhibition of LDL oxidation.', 'Furthermore, polyphenols extracted
    from the virgin olive oil containing mainly HTyr were also shown to inhibit different
    kinds of cancer, e.g.', proliferation of human leukemia cells and colon carcinogenesis.,
  'This work summarizes current knowledge on the bioavailability, biological activities
    and major active components of olive oil.']
