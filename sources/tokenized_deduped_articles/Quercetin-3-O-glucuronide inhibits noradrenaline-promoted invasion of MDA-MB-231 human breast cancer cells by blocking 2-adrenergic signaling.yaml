[Endogenous catecholamines such as adrenaline and noradrenaline are released from
    the adrenal gland and sympathetic nervous system during exposure to stress., 'The
    adrenergic system plays a central role in stress signaling, and excessive stress
    was found to be associated with increased production of reactive oxygen species.',
  Overproduction of ROS induces oxidative damage in tissues and causes the development
    of diseases such as cancer., "In this study, we investigated the effects of quercetin-3-O-glucuronide,
    a circulating metabolite of quercetin, which is a type of natural flavonoid, on
    the catecholamine-induced \xCE\xB22-adrenergic receptor-mediated response in MDA-MB-231
    human breast cancer cells expressing \xCE\xB22-AR.", "Treatment with A or NA at
    concentrations above 1 \xCE\xBCM generated significant levels of ROS, and NA treatment
    induced the gene expression of heme oxygenase-1, and matrix metalloproteinase-2
    and -9.", "Inhibitors of p38 MAP kinase, cAMP-dependent protein kinase, activator
    protein-1 transcription factor, and NF-\xCE\xBAB and AP-1 decreased MMP2 and MMP9
    gene expression.", 'NA also enhanced cAMP induction, RAS activation and phosphorylation
    of ERK1/2.', "These results suggested that the cAMP-PKA, MAPK, and ROS-NF-\xCE\xBAB
    pathways are involved in \xCE\xB22-AR signaling.", "Treatment with 0.1 \xCE\xBCM
    Q3G suppressed ROS generation, cAMP and RAS activation, phosphorylation of ERK1/2
    and the expression of HMOX1, MMP2, and MMP9 genes.", "Furthermore, Q3G suppressed
    invasion of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and MMP-9 induction, and inhibited
    the binding of -NA to \xCE\xB22-AR.", "These results suggest that Q3G may function
    to suppress invasion of breast cancer cells by controlling \xCE\xB22-adrenergic
    signaling, and may be a dietary chemopreventive factor for stress-related breast
    cancer."]
