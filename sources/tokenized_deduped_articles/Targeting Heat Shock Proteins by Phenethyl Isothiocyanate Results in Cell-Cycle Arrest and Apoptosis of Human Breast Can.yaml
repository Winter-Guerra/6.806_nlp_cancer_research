['Heat shock proteins are chaperones for several client proteins involved in transcriptional
    regulation, signal transduction, and cell cycle control.', HSPs are abundantly
    expressed in a wide range of cancers and are transcriptionally regulated by heat
    shock factor., 'Most of the synthetic HSP inhibitors exhibit toxicity, therefore,
    searching for inhibitors with limited or no toxicity will be of help.', 'The objective
    of the present study was to determine the effect of natural isothiocyanate on
    different HSPs and HSF1 in 2 breast cancer cell lines, namely breast adenocarcinoma
    MCF-7 and highly metastatic breast cancer cell MDA-MB-231.', PEITC significantly
    inhibited the expression of HSPs and HSF1., 'Molecular consequences due to HSP
    inhibition were downregulation of cell-cycle regulatory proteins like Cyclin B1,
    CDK1, Cdc25C, PLK-1, and upregulation of p21 irrespective of p53 status.', These
    modulations were accompanied by cell-cycle arrest at G2/M phase and apoptosis
    by activation of caspases 3 and 9., PEITC therefore may be regarded as a potent
    HSP inhibitor and an antitumor agent in the treatment of breast cancer.]
