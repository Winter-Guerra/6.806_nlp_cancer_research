    aromatic amines originate from muscle- based foods cooked at high temperatures.',
  Epidemiologic studies have shown that some HAAs are highly mutagenic and almost
    all of them are also carcinogenic., 'To date, more than 25 HAAs have been isolated
    as potent mutagenic/ carcinogenic compounds from cooked meat.', 'The International
    Agency for Research on Cancer reported that some HAAs, such as 2-amino-3,4-dimethylimidazo  quinoline,
    2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo  quinoxaline, 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenyl- imidazo  pyridine,
    2-amino-9H-pyrido  indole, 2-amino-3-methyl-9H-pyrido  indole, and 3-amino-1-methyl-
    5H-pyrdo  indole are classified as possible human carcinogens, while 2-amino-3-methylimidazo  quinoline
    is classified as a probable carcinogen.', 'Besides, 1-methyl-9H- pyrido  indole
    and 9H-pyrido  indole can enhance the mutagenic activity of other compounds.',
  'Formation of HAAs in muscle-based foods is mainly influenced by the cooking time,
    temperature, and cooking method.', 'HAAs in cooked poultry, beef, pork, and fish
    have been studied.', Oz et al., 'studied the effects of microwave, oven, hot plate,
    pan-frying, and barbecuing on formation of HAAs in chicken and fish.', 'The effects
    of different cooking methods, including pan-frying, deep- frying, charcoal, and
    grilling on formation of HAAs in duck and chicken were studied by Liao et al..',
  'However, there is no study reporting the effects of Chinese cooking methods on
    formation of HAAs in lamb.', 'Lamb, which is rich in nutrition and has a unique
    flavor, is a popular meat in China, especially in some minority nationality areas.',
  'The main Chinese cooking methods of lamb are roasting, frying, pan-frying, and

    in China in which lamb is boiled in water with condiments for several hours.,
  There is currently no good understanding of how HAAs are generated in lamb cooked
    using traditional Chinese methods., 'The aims of the present study were to investigate
    the effects of traditional Chinese cooking methods and different cooking times
    on formation of HAAs in lamb, to assess human exposure to these compounds in cooked
    lamb, and to provide methods to reduce levels of HAAs in cooked lamb.', Materials
    and Methods Materials All chemicals and solvents used were of HPLC or analytical
    grade., Ultrapure water was prepared using a Milli-Q Advantage water purification
    system., 'Methanol was purchased from Fisher Inc., acetonitrile was obtained from
    MREDA, and methylene chloride, hydrochloric acid, sodium hydroxide, and diatomaceous
    earth were obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent.', Bond Elut cartridges were
    purchased from Agilent Technologies and an Oasis MCX cartridge was provided by
    Waters for solid phase extraction., 'The 9 heterocyclic aromatic amine standards

    and silverside were purchased from a local market in Beijing, China in August
    of 2012 and stored at \u221218 oC until used.", Sample preparation Muscle without
    visible fat or connective tissue was ground through a pore plate with a meat grinder.,
  'An amount of 50 g of the meat paste was placed into a mould to produce uniform
    patties, then patties were cooked by roasting, frying, pan-frying, or stewing
    with seasonings for different times.', 'For roasting, patties were cooked in an
    oven at 200 oC for 5, 15, 25, 35, and 45 min.', 'For frying, 3 patties were fried
    in a stainless fryer in soybean oil at 200 oC.', 'For pan frying, a stainless
    steel pan was sprayed with 5 g of soybean oil and preheated to 200 oC, then patties
    were pan-fried for 2.0, 3.5, 5.0, 6.5, and 8.0 min.', 'For stewing with seasonings,
    150 g of paste was mixed with 0.75 g of transglutaminase and divided into 3 equal
    moulds, then salted at 4 oC overnight.', "The prepared patties were stewed in

    7 g of star aniseed, 12 g of ginger, 10 g of green Chinese onion, and 9 g of Chinese
    cinnamon at 100 oC for 1,2,4, and 6 h. Extraction of heterocyclic aromatic amines
    Heterocyclic aromatic amines were extracted according to the methods of Gross
    and Gr\xFCter and Messner and Murkovic with slight modification.", Each patty
    was ground into comminuted meat with a grinder and 2 g of the ground meat was
    added to 10 mL of 2 M NaOH., 'The resulting suspension was mixed by magnetic stirring
    for 20 min, then extracted using ultrasound for 30 min.', The resulting alkaline
    extraction solution was mixed with 12 g of diatomaceous earth and transferred
    to empty Bond Elut cartridges., 'Preliminary work using different solvents for
    extraction showed that the most efficient recovery of the 9 HAAs was achieved
    using dichloromethane rather than ethyl acetate, so dichloromethane was used for
    extraction.', 'The eluent was passed through coupled Oasis MCX cartridges washed
    with 2 mL of 0.1 M HCl-MeOH, 2 mL of MeOH, and 2 mL of ultrapure water.Then, cartridges
    were washed with 2 mL of MeOH-ammonia.', "The eluent was flown dried with a nitrogen

    Polak et al.', reported that recovery values of HAAs were between 83 and 100%.,
  Oz et al., 'reported recovery values of HAAs between 32 and 66%, similar to results
    of this study.', "Limits of detection were 0.10, 0.05, 0.09, 0.18, 0.33, 0.18,

    Trp-P-2, A\u03B1C, and MeA\u03B1C with a signal/noise ratio of 3:1.", Effects
    of cooking methods on total HAAs The effects of different cooking methods on the
    content of total HAAs are shown in Fig., '2.', The content of total HAAs ranged
    from 51.07 ng/g-120.32 ng/g for stewing in seasoning with cooking for 60 min to
    360 min., 'Content ranges for samples cooked by roasting, frying, and pan-frying

    ng/g of HAAs, respectively.', 'Patties cooked by stewing contained the highest
    HAAs content, followed by roasting, frying and pan-frying.', The total HAAs content
    increased with cooking time using the 4 cooking methods., 'At stewing times longer
    than 1 h, the total HAAs content in samples was sharply increased from 51.07 ng/g
    to 95.33 ng/g.', 'In roasted and fried samples cooked for 2.5 and 6.5 min, the
    HAAs contents were dramatically higher than in samples cooked for less than 2.5
    min and 6.5 min.', 'As the pan-frying time increased, the concentration of HAAs
    increased gradually.', 'The main HAAs in stewing with seasoning were Harman and

    at a well done level, and 3.06 ng/ g in barbecued samples.', Liao et al., reported
    21.3 ng/g of HAAs in deep-fried chicken breast., Differences between the results
    of this study and other reported results were due to different materials used.,
  Ground lamb was used in this study., 'Stewing generated dramatically higher HAAs
    than the other cooking methods, probably because of seasonings that increased
    formation of total HAAs.', Some added seasonings may promote HAAs formation due
    to acceleration of the interactions between amino acids and reducing sugars during
    Maillard reactions., Dong et al., reported that addition of an excess amount of
    onion promoted HAAs formation in cooked beef patties., Sugars and oyster sauce
    seasonings are precursors to HAAS formation., Lan et al., reported that pork marinated
    with soy sauce and rock candy generated a higher HAAs content than a control group.,
  Dissolution of HAAs precursors from muscle may occur when heated for a long time
    in a water blend., 'In this study, for all 4 cooking methods the total concentration
    of HAAs increased with the cooking time.', Oz et al., 'reported the same trend
    for chicken and fish cooked using microwave, oven, hot-plate, pan-frying, and
    barbecuing from rare to very well done.', 'In this study, when the roasting time
    increased from 25 min to 35 min, or from 35 min to 45 min, the total HAAs content
    increased and the same trend was also found in fried samples.', 'Generally, the
    total HAAs content in muscle tissue was low due to being processed for a short
    time.', The HAAs content results in this study were consistent with other published
    results., Effect of cooking methods on HAAs contents The effects of different
    cooking methods on the amounts of the 4 polar and 5 non- polar HAAs are presented
    in Table 1., 'MeIQx, Harman, and Norharman were the most common HAAs for all 4
    cooking methods.', High amounts of Harman and Norharman were found in pan-fried
    chicken breast., Toribio et al., 'reported that 180.2 ng/g of Norharman and 240.7
    ng/g of Harman were detected in meat extracts that contained high amounts of the
    HAAs precursors amino acids, reducing sugars, and other substances.', The concentrations
    of the 9 varieties of HAAs increased as the cooking time was extended., 'The polar
    HAAs were the most abundant HAAs in roasted and fried samples, while the non-polar
    HAAs were dominant in pan- fried and stewed samples.', Liao et al., reported 4
    polar HAAs and 6 non-polar HAAs in chicken and duck breast pan-fried at 180 oC
    for 5 min per side., The reported polar HAAs content of was 22.97 ng/g and the
    non-polar HAAs content was 4.43 ng/g in pan-fried chicken., Differences between
    the results of this report the results of Liao et al., probably relate to the
    type of meat used., Beef is called red meat and pork and chicken are called white
    meat., The main difference is a low fat content for white meat., 'For chicken
    meat, the amino acid and the glucose and creatine contents also differ from red
    meat.', Sun et al., "reported that the highest concentration of HAAs was in ground
    meat, followed by sliced meat and small meat cubes, which can account for the
    differences between the results present herein and the results of Liao et al..
    IQ, MeIQx, 4,8-DiMeIQx, PhIP, Harman, Norharman, A\u03B1C, and MeA\u03B1C were
    detected in roasted meat, but not Trp-P-2.", 'The total HAAs content of roasted
    lamb for each roasting time were 4.39, 8.39, 10.47, 54.91, and 123.15 ng/g, respectively.',
  The amount of IQ was between 0.92 and 4.39 ng/g in all samples., Roasting did not
    form a high level of HAAs., IQ was not detected in lamb chops cooked for different
    times., 'However, Sun et al.', 'reported IQ in minced lamb which was oven-roasted
    at 250 oC for 30 min and in lamb cubes with red pepper powder, black pepper powder,
    sugar, and salt.', Differences in these results probably relate to different types

    ng/g of total HAAs.', "Individual HAAs contents were 0.53-0.65 ng/g of IQ, 0-1.16
    ng/g of MeIQx, 0.18-2.98 ng/g of PhIP, 0-0.96 ng/g of Harman, 0-1.36 ng/g of Norharman,
    0-0.68 ng/g of Trp-P-2, and 0-2.26 ng/g of A\u03B1C Pan-frying generally produced
    MeIQx at levels below 2 ng/g in this study.", Krul et al., 'reported a higher
    MeIQx content of 10.4 ng/g in roasted chicken breast, probably due to a longer
    cooking time and a higher cooking temperature.', PhIP usually exists in cooked
    meat at higher levels than other polar HAAs., Brockstedt et al., 'detected 70,
    64.9, and 5.8 ng/g of PhIP in pan-fried skinless and boneless chicken and turkey
    breast, and in grilled lamb steak without fat and bones, respectively.', Differences
    in results between the studies cited above can be explained by the different types
    of raw meat used., IQ was isolated from most cooked samples and the content was
    usually below 1 ng/g in this study., Busquets et al., reported that IQ levels
    in lamb steak grilled for 11 min at 752 Guo et al., 175 to 200 oC were lower than
    0.04 ng/g., Oz et al., also reported similar results for chicken chops pan-fried
    at 200 oC for 5-10 min., 'Stewing, compared with roasting, frying and, pan-frying
    is a mild cooking method because of a lower cooking temperature.', 'However, seasonings
    are usually used in stewing for several hours.', There are reports on the effects
    of stewing/boiling on the HAAs formation., 'When whole chicken/chicken breast
    were boiled in water without seasoning and spices for 4 h, only Harman and Norharman
    were detected, and the highest content was below 0.4 ng/g.', "When pork was cooked
    for 4 h in the presence of 10% soy sauce and 1% rock candy, the 7 HAAs of IQ,
    MeIQx, MeIQ, 4,8-DiMeIQx, Trp-p-1, PhIP, and A\u03B1C were detected, and the highest
    content was MeIQx at 3.43 ng/g.", 'Differences between samples may be related
    to the use of soy sauce and rock candy, which both contain HAAs precursors.',
  'In this study, the four HAAs of IQ, MeIQx, 4,8-DiMeIQx, Harman, and Norharman were
    found in stewed lamb and levels increased to 0.49, 0.69, 58.59, and 59.72 ng/g
    after cooking for 6 h compared to ones cooked for 1 h, respectively.', 'The amount
    of total HAAs increased significantly during the stewing and up to to 120.32 ng/g
    at 6 h, most of which was due to Harman and Norharman, the amounts of which were
    much higher than reported by Solyakov and Skog.', 'The presence of soy sauce containing
    the amino acid, glucose, and sugar HAAs precursors, and the long heating time
    were factors.', The types and contents of HAAs generated in cooked lamb using
    different cooking procedures are dependent on the cooking method and time., A
    total of 8 specific HAAs were found in roasted lamb., Stewing produced 5 of the
    9 known HAAs., 'Amounts of PhIP, Harman, and Norharman in all samples were highest.',
  'Stewing in seasoning produced the highest amount of total HAAs, followed by roasting,
    frying, and pan-frying.', The results of this study indicate that the HAAs levels
    in cooked lamb increased with an increase in cooking time., Reductions in cooking
    times should reduce the amounts of HAAs produced in lamb during cooking., Acknowledgments
