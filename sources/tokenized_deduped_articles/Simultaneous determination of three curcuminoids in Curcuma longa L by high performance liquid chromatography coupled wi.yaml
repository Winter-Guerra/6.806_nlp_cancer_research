['A novel method for analysis of three active components curcumin, demethoxycurcumin
    and bisdemethoxycurcumin in Curcuma longa L. was developed by HPLC coupled with
    electrochemical detection.', Three curcuminoids were well separated on a C18 column
    and detected with high sensitivity., A mobile phase containing acetonitrile and
    10 mM Na2HPO4-H3PO4 was used., "Good linearity was obtained in the range of 0.208-41.6,
    0.197-39.4, and 0.227-114 \xCE\xBCM for curcumin, demethoxycurcumin and bisdemethoxycurcumin
    respectively.", "The limit of detection reached up to 10\u22128 M, which was lower
    than that by UV detection.", 'The relative standard deviations ranged from 1.06%
    to 1.88% for intra-day precision and from 4.30% to 5.79% for inter-day precision,
    respectively.', The proposed method has been applied in real herb sample and recoveries
    ranging from 86.3% to 111% were obtained.]
