[It has been suggested that combined effect of natural products may improve the treatment
    effectiveness in combating proliferation of cancer cells., 'Here, we examined
    the combined anticancer activities of compounds of three natural origin including
    baicalein, curcumin, and resveratrol with chemotherapy drug paclitaxel respectively,
    which showed that combination of paclitaxel with curcumin exhibited synergistic
    growth inhibition and induced significant apoptosis in MCF-7 cell lines.', Treatment
    of MCF-7 cell lines with paclitaxel and curcumin induced the apoptosis of regulatory
    protein Bcl-2 but decreased Bax expression., 'In addition, simultaneous treatment
    with paclitaxel and curcumin strongly inhibited paclitaxel-induced activities
    of EGFR signaling.', 'Furthermore, the combination of paclitaxel and curcumin
    exerted increased anti-tumor efficacy on mouse models.', 'Overall, our data described
    the promising therapeutic potential and underlying mechanisms of combining paclitaxel
    with curcumin in treating breast cancer.']
