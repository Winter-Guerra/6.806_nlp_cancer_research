['Several epidemiologic studies have reported a positive association between breast
    cancer risk and high intake of sweets, which may be due to an insulin-related
    mechanism.', "We investigated this association in a population-based case\u2013control
    study of 1,434 cases and 1,440 controls from Long Island, NY.", 'Shortly after
    diagnosis, subjects were interviewed in-person to assess potential breast cancer
    risk factors, and self-completed a modified Block food frequency questionnaire,
    which included 11 items pertaining to consumption of sweets in the previous year.',
  'Using unconditional logistic regression models, we estimated the association between
    consumption of sweets and breast cancer.', 'Consumption of a food grouping that
    included dessert foods, sweet beverages, and added sugars was positively associated
    with breast cancer risk .', The OR was slightly higher when only dessert foods
    were considered., 'The association with desserts was stronger among pre-menopausal
    women than post-menopausal women, although the interaction with menopause was
    not statistically significant.', 'Our study indicates that frequent consumption
    of sweets, particularly desserts, may be associated with an increased risk of
    breast cancer.', These results are consistent with other studies that implicate
    insulin-related factors in breast carcinogenesis., "Research suggests that diets
    high in refined sugars, sweets, and desserts may increase a woman\u2019s risk
    for breast cancer , although several null findings  have resulted in a lack of
    consensus on the issue.", 'Dietary behaviors that result in elevated blood glucose
    levels, such as frequent consumption of refined carbohydrates, consequently increase
    plasma insulin.', 'Hyperinsulinemia may be a risk factor for breast cancer as
    insulin is mitogenic, thereby encouraging cellular proliferation and promoting
    tumor growth; excess insulin is also indirectly related to increased levels of
    free estrogen through inhibition of the production of sex-hormone binding globulin
    .', "Chronically elevated insulin may be one of the pathways involved in the observed
    associations between energy balance and breast carcinogenesis as evidenced by
    the results from a recent meta-analysis on C-peptide and insulin levels and breast
    cancer risk , although the positive association was limited to case\u2013control
    studies.", 'Thus recent research has focused on evaluating lifestyle factors,
    such as dietary behaviors, that may influence insulin exposure.', "We evaluated
    the association between increasing consumption of sweet foods and breast cancer
    risk in a large, population-based case\u2013control study of breast cancer among
    women residing in Long Island, NY.", We also examined the potential for effect
    modification by exposures known to be associated with hyperinsulinemia or related
    hormonal pathways., "The Long Island Breast Cancer Study Project is a population-based
    case\u2013control study of breast cancer conducted in Nassau and Suffolk counties
    in New York .", The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of participating
    institutions., Cases were English-speaking adult women with a first primary in
    situ or invasive breast cancer diagnosed between 1996 and 1997., Potentially eligible
    women were identified through pathology departments of participating hospitals
    and their physicians were contacted to confirm the diagnosis and obtain permission
    to contact the patients for participation in the study., "Controls were frequency
    matched to the expected distribution of cases in 5-year age groups in 1996\u20131997;
    potentially eligible controls under the age of 65 were identified by random digit
    dialing, while those over age 65 were identified from the Health Care Finance
    Administration rosters.", 'A total of 1,508 eligible cases and 1,556 eligible
    controls agreed to participate in the study.', 'Participants ranged in age from
    20 to 98 years, and 94% were white and 4% were African American.', Signed informed
    consent was obtained for all subjects prior to data collection., 'Risk factor
    information was assessed by structured questionnaire, which was administered by
    trained interviewers during in-home visits.', 'Information collected included
    menstrual and reproductive history, exogenous hormone use, cigarette smoking,
    alcohol use, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory use, anthropometric measures, and
    physical activity.', Factors found to increase breast cancer risk in this study
    population have been previously published ., 'For case women who signed a medical
    record release form, tumor stage and hormone receptor status were ascertained
    from the medical records.', Approximately 98% of the respondents completed a self-administered
    modified Block food frequency questionnaire that took an average of approximately
    30 minutes to complete ., 'The FFQ assessed frequency and relative portion size
    for 101 food items in the year prior to the interview, with line items for sweet
    foods including desserts, sweetened beverages, and added sweeteners.', 'Food groupings
    were developed to be consistent with previous studies  and to help distinguish
    the effect of desserts, which are more calorie and sugar rich, from total intake
    of sweets.', 'For each line item, we created a variable representing the number
    of average sized servings per week by multiplying the relative portion size by
    the number of servings per week reported.', We summed these variables to define
    number of servings per week of food groups corresponding to total sweets as well
    as dessert foods only., 'To eliminate the influence of outliers, we excluded those
    subjects where the log-transformed total energy intake was more than three standard
    deviations of the log-transformed mean.', 'We also eliminated those subjects with
    missing data on menopausal status yielding a final sample of 1,434 cases and 1,440
    controls.', 'Unconditional logistic regression , adjusting for age at reference
    date in 5-year categories, was used to estimate odds ratios and 95% confidence
    intervals for the association between sweets and breast cancer.', Intake of total
    sweets and desserts were categorized according to quartiles of intake among all
    controls., 'Potential confounders included total energy, family history of breast
    cancer, parity, oral contraceptive use, body mass index 1 year prior to reference
    date, physical activity from menarche to reference date, weight change since age
    20, fruit and vegetable intake, meat intake, alcohol use, and smoking.', 'Only
    total energy intake notably altered the effect estimates, therefore our final
    models are adjusted for age and energy intake.', Tests for linear trend were conducted
    using the continuous variable in the model and examining the p-value for the corresponding
    beta coefficient from the logistic regression model ., We used multinomial logistic
    regression to examine if the effects differed by in situ or invasive cancers by
    estimating multinomial models allowing the effect to vary by in situ or invasive
    type and separate models restricting the effect to be the same for both types.,
  These models were then compared using a likelihood ratio test., All statistical
    analyses were conducted using Stata version 9.2., Multiplicative interaction  between
    sweets consumption and select variables was assessed using the likelihood ratio
    test to compare models with and without interaction terms; these interactions
    were deemed significant for p-values ;0.10., 'Potential effect modifiers included
    factors thought to directly or indirectly affect endogenous insulin exposure:
    menopausal status, body mass index, weight change since age 20, physical activity,
    and alcohol intake.', 'As shown in Table 1, we observed a modest increase in the
    risk of breast cancer with increasing frequency of consumption of total sweets
    among all women.', 'We noted a slightly higher effect among pre-menopausal women
    when compared with post-menopausal women, although the test for interaction was
    not statistically significant.', The observed association was stronger when only
    dessert foods were considered., 'Among all women, those in the highest quartile
    of dessert consumption showed a 55% increase in risk of breast cancer compared
    to those with the lowest quartile of intake.', 'We again found a stronger association
    among pre-menopausal women when compared with post-menopausal women, however,
    effect modification by menopausal status was not significant.', The observed patterns
    generally suggest that risk increases monotonically with increasing consumption
    although tests for linear trend were not statistically significant., 'In analyses
    that considered individual food items, no single sweet item appeared to be responsible
    for the associations noted with total sweets or desserts.', The multinomial logistic
    regression models comparing the effects between in situ and invasive cancers showed
    no significant difference in effect of total sweets or desserts only., "Age and
    energy adjusted OR for association between sweets consumption and breast cancer,
    for all women and separately by menopausal status, Long Island Breast Cancer Study
    Project, Long Island, NY, 1996\u20131997  \n\n\n\n\nResults for effect modification
    by BMI, weight change since age 20, physical activity, and alcohol consumption
    are presented in Table 2.", 'For total sweets intake, only physical activity was
    observed to modify the association with breast cancer risk, with more active women
    apparently more susceptible to the negative effect of frequent sweets consumption.',
  "Age and energy adjusted OR for association between sweets consumption and breast
    cancer, by BMI in the year prior to reference date, physical activity from menarche

    of servings per week among all controls\n\n\nFor dessert consumption, heterogeneity
    across strata of other factors that could potentially impact endogenous insulin
    levels was evident not only for physical activity, but also body size, adult weight
    gain, and alcohol.", 'For example, the association with breast cancer risk was
    essentially null across all levels of intake among inactive women, whereas among
    the most active women, we observed a nearly doubling of risk comparing the highest
    to the lowest quartile of dessert intake.', 'For body size, women with lower BMI
    exhibited a stronger association with dessert consumption compared to those with
    higher BMI.', Greater adult weight gain appears to somewhat attenuate the effect
    of increasing dessert consumption which is not observed when all sweet foods are
    considered., 'For alcohol, ever drinkers showed a significantly greater risk of
    breast cancer across all levels of dessert intake compared to those women who
    reported never drinking alcohol.', "In a large, population-based case\u2013control
    study of breast cancer, we found a positive association between consumption of
    sweet foods, especially desserts and breast cancer risk among both pre- and post-menopausal
    women.", 'The adverse effects may be stronger among women who are more physically
    active; for desserts, high risk subgroups may also include women who are leaner
    and those who reported ever having consumed alcohol.', Our results are consistent
    with other recent epidemiologic research ., "In a population-based case\u2013control
    study of breast cancer among American women under age 45, Potischman  observed
    a 32% increase in risk of breast cancer among those who consumed the most sweets,
    when compared with the least.", "A 2005 report of an Italian hospital-based case\u2013control
    study  also showed a 19% increase among those in the highest tertile of intake
    of dessert foods.", "In a Canadian case\u2013control study, Lubin  reported a
    positive association with sweet desserts of a magnitude similar to what we observe
    in our data.", 'Some authors have postulated that these results could be due to
    other characteristics of these foods, such as fat content, however, the associations
    for lower-fat foods, such as sweetened beverages and sugar intake  would be more
    consistent with an insulin-related pathway.', 'There may also be a synergistic
    effect of high-sugar and high-calorie foods on breast cancer development, which
    could explain the stronger effects for desserts.', 'Inconsistent findings between
    consumption of sweets and breast cancer in the epidemiologic literature may be
    due to differences in exposure definitions, which have included intake of sugars
    , sweets and desserts , individual foods  or an overall dietary pattern that included
    high intake of sweets .', 'The studies of individual foods  or food groups  tended
    to show positive associations between sweets consumption and breast cancer incidence,
    while a similar association was not seen in those studies that evaluated overall
    dietary patterns that reflected frequent sweets consumption .', Variations in
    exposure definitions used across studies may correspond to differences in underlying
    biologic effects., "Case\u2013control studies that examined overall measures of
    dietary glycemic burden, such as total carbohydrate intake, glycemic index, and
    glycemic load, have generally shown a positive association with breast cancer
    risk .", 'In contrast, many cohort studies , with a few exceptions , report null
    associations between total carbohydrate intake, GI, GL and breast cancer risk
    .', "It is possible that differential recall in case\u2013control studies or the
    fact that prospective observation may alter usual behavior in cohort studies could
    explain some of these discrepancies.", 'Alternatively, the inconsistent associations
    with cancer incidence in the epidemiologic literature may be explained by the
    use of the GI and/or the GL themselves, which is a controversial practice.', 'Because
    these measures pertain only to individual foods and not combinations of foods,
    some researchers believe that they may not accurately reflect the glycemic burden
    of an individual diet .', 'Further, the postprandial glycemic response to foods
    explains only about 23% of the variation in insulin levels , as noted by other
    authors .', Analyses that account for food groupings and dietary patterns may
    identify exposures that affect a multitude of factors that affect disease risk
    more than when nutrients or characteristics of the foods are considered individually
    ., 'Notably, a recent analysis that combined dietary pattern analysis with GI
    and GL showed that the dietary patterns identified were associated with increased
    breast cancer risk among pre-menopausal women more so than when the simple GI
    and GL were considered .', "Our findings for effect modification by body size
    and physical activity are somewhat unexpected, given that a recent case\u2013control
    study did not find similar patterns , although the discrepancy may be due to differences
    in study design.", The previous study  was hospital-based whereas our study was
    population-based., 'Given that body size and physical activity are known to contribute
    to multiple chronic diseases, the distribution of these factors among a control
    sample that is population-based, rather than hospital-based, is likely to better
    represent the underlying distribution of the source population from which the
    cases are drawn .', 'However, although the potential interactions between sweets
    intake and body size and/or physical activity appear plausible, our results on
    more pronounced effects among special subgroups of women need confirmation by
    other investigations.', 'In addition to functioning as a tumor promoter by itself,
    insulin increases the activity of insulin-like growth factor I, which also functions
    as a tumor promoter  and has been associated with breast cancer in several epidemiologic
    studies .', 'Our results for insulin-related dietary exposures are also consistent
    with other findings from the LIBCSP, which found an increased risk of breast cancer
    among pre-menopausal women with polymorphisms for IGF-I , which is in agreement
    with evidence for IGF-I in most other studies .', 'Our analysis benefits from
    a large, population-based sample that includes both pre- and post-menopausal women
    and comprehensive assessment of anthropometric, lifestyle, and dietary factors.',
  One limitation is the potential for measurement error through use of a FFQ to ascertain
    usual diet., 'Although this is a concern, FFQs adequately rank dietary intakes
    , which is the approach we used for our analysis.', "In case\u2013control studies
    the potential for bias due to differential recall is always present, where subjects
    with disease may recall unhealthy behaviors with greater frequency when compared
    with controls.", 'Additionally, although the completion of the self-administered
    FFQ was over 98% among both case and control respondents, the response rate to
    the main questionnaire among controls was lower than expected, primarily among
    older women .', 'Thus, there may be selection bias due to non-response in our
    data, but its potential influence would primarily affect our results among women
    65 years of age of older.', 'Selection bias among controls has the potential to
    induce a spurious association , yet our observed effects were more pronounced
    among pre-menopausal women, the group for whom response rates were about 80% and
    thus control selection was not an issue.', 'Therefore, we believe it unlikely
    that our findings, particularly among younger women, are the result of selection
    bias.', 'In summary, our results suggest that high consumption of sweet foods,
    particularly desserts, may be positively associated with breast cancer risk, and
    the effect may be most pronounced among leaner and more physically active women.',
  The implications of these findings may be that the greatest reduction in breast
    cancer risk involves regular physical activity  and maintenance of a healthy weight  combined
    with a diet low in sweets and desserts., These results lend additional evidence
    to the role of insulin in breast carcinogenesis and may highlight an area for
    potential intervention., This work supported in part by National Cancer Institute
