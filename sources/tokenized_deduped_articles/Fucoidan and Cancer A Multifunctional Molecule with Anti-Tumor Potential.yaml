[': There is a wide variety of cancer types yet, all share some common cellular and
    molecular behaviors.', Most of the chemotherapeutic agents used in cancer treatment
    are designed to target common deregulated mechanisms within cancer cells., Many
    healthy tissues are also affected by the cytotoxic effects of these chemical agents.,
  'Fucoidan, a natural component of brown seaweed, has anti-cancer activity against
    various cancer types by targeting key apoptotic molecules.', It also has beneficial
    effects as it can protect against toxicity associated with chemotherapeutic agents
    and radiation., Thus the synergistic effect of fucoidan with current anti-cancer
    agents is of considerable interest., 'This review discusses the mechanisms by
    which fucoidan retards tumor development, eradicates tumor cells and synergizes
    with anti-cancer chemotherapeutic agents.', Challenges to the development of fucoidan
    as an anti-cancer agent will also be discussed., Cancers are multifactorial diseases
    of various etiologies., They arise largely as a result of acquired genetic changes
    that alter cell function leading neoplastic cells to gain survival or growth advantages
    ., 'For cancer cells to survive, the generation of new blood vessels is required.',
  Cancer leads to death mostly through tumor cell spread to distal organs., 'Various
    pathways are disrupted in tumor development, which result from unbalanced programmed
    cell death, disordered signaling pathways, angiogenesis and poor immune response
    against cancer.', Most of the chemotherapeutic agents used in cancer treatment
    target these major deregulated pathways., 'Unfortunately, as many of these therapies
    cause severe side effects, the toxicities limit the dose and thus the efficacy
    of treatment.', 'Therefore, there is strong interest in developing better-tolerated
    anti-cancer agents.', Chemotherapy has been a cornerstone of the standard cancer
    treatment regimens since the 1960s., A variety of chemicals ranging from traditional
    agents such as methotrexate and folic acid analogues to novel chemicals such as
    anthracyclines have been used in cancer treatment ., 'Despite promising tumor
    growth-inhibitory effects in pre-clinical tests, many fail in clinical trials
    when adverse unexpected side effects are revealed.', Traditionally anti-cancer
    chemotherapy targets rapidly dividing and proliferating cells., 'Therefore, normal
    cells which have high-proliferating potential are also affected.', Novel therapeutic
    agents are designed to target specific molecules., 'However, these targeted therapies
    are not always completely free of side effects either.', 'For instance, vemurafenib,
    a B-Raf enzyme inhibitor, is specific for oncogenic mutant V600E B-Raf positive
    melanoma cells.', 'This drug was the first targeted molecular therapy, which was
    approved for use in advanced stages of melanoma.', 'Although vemurafenib has shown
    significant beneficial anti-cancer effects, several studies have reported the
    rapid emergence of acquired resistance and adverse dermatological effects.', It
    also stimulates B-Raf expression in V600E B-Raf negative patients promoting melanoma
    growth ., Monoclonal antibodies are another example of targeted therapy and are
    designed to specifically target the cancer antigens located on tumor cells., Monoclonal
    antibodies are generally safer than chemotherapy and the side effects caused by
    them include mild allergic reactions such as urticaria., But they can also cause
    severe reactions such as infusion reactions and serum sickness., 'As an example,
    rituximab, which is widely used in treating B-cell lymphoma, generally causes
    only mild toxicities, however, reports have described occasional cases with severe
    complications such as anaphylactic reactions and myocardial infarction as well
    as high risk of tumor lysis syndrome in patients who have a high burden of tumor
    cells in their circulation .', 'Concerns over toxicity, tumor cell resistance
    and development of secondary cancers from chemotherapeutic chemicals have generated
    interest in exploiting natural products for cancer treatment.', 'Flavopiridol
    is a flavonoid derived from the indigenous Indian plant Dysoxylum binectariferum,
    which inhibits cell cycle progression.', It is the first cyclin-dependent kinase
    inhibitor to be approved for use in clinical trials ., Natural products are also
    being tested as adjuvants for use in synergy with chemotherapeutic agents., For
    example those with immunomodulatory effects can reduce immune suppression and
    the associated increased risk of infection., In George et al., 'study, Indukantha
    Ghritha, a polyherbal preparation consisting of 17 plant components, was used
    as an adjuvant to cyclophosphamide cancer chemotherapy and shown to stimulate
    the hematopoietic system and induce leukopoiesis in tumor-bearing mice.', 'When
    administrated in combination with cyclophosphamide, it reversed myelosuppression
    induced by cyclophosphamide suggesting its potential to minimize or reverse chemotherapy-induced
    leukopenia.', Polysaccharides include a large family of diverse biopolymers.,
  They are constituted by monosaccharide residues linked together by O-glycosidic
    bonds that are found in natural and semi-synthetic structures ., 'Due to structural
    diversity, polysaccharides display the highest biological properties among macromolecules.',
  Many natural polysaccharides obtained from natural sources such as plants and algae
    have anti-cancer properties., The multifunctional structure of natural polysaccharides
    also allows them to be used in conjugation with anti-cancer agents that lack physiochemical
    and biopharmaceutical properties ., 'Fucoidan is a natural sulfated polysaccharide
    that exists mainly in the cell wall matrix of various species of brown seaweed
    such as mozuku, kombu, limumoui, bladderwrack and wakame .', Various forms of
    fucoidan have also been recognized in some marine invertebrates such as sea urchins  and
    sea cucumbers ., 'The brown seaweeds containing fucoidan are widely consumed as
    part of the normal diet in East Asia, particularly Japan, China and Korea.', The
    anti-cancer property of fucoidan has been demonstrated in vivo and in vitro in
    different types of cancers., 'Nevertheless, it has been rarely investigated for
    its anti-cancer properties in clinical trials.', 'Fucoidan mediates its activity
    through various mechanisms such as induction of cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and
    immune system activation.', 'Additional activities of fucoidan have been reported
    that may be linked to the observed anti-cancer properties and these include induction
    of inflammation through immune system, oxidative stress and stem cell mobilization.',
  These activities have been reviewed by Kwak ., Fucoidan treatment results in sub
    G0/G1 cell accumulation in a variety of cell types ., It can also induce cell
    cycle arrest in other phases; Riou et al., and Mourea et al., 'reported arrest
    in G1 phase in a chemo-resistant non-small-cell bronchopulmonary carcinoma line
    by fucoidan from Ascophyllum nodosum and Bifurcaria bifurcate, respectively.',
  'In an investigation of the mechanism of the action, fucoidan demonstrated significant
    down regulation of cyclin D1, cyclin D2 and CDK4 in cancer cells .', The crude
    fucoidan from Fucus vesiculosus increased the level of p21/WAF1/CIP1 in PC3 cells
    and down-regulated E2F; a transcription factor that controls progression of cells
    from G1 to S phase ., 'In a recent study, fucoidan down-regulated cyclin E, CDK2,
    CDK4 resulting in G0/G1 arrest in human bladder cancer 5637 cells.', 'Furthermore,
    immunoprecipitation assays revealed a significant increase in the binding of p21/WAF1/CIP1
    to CDK2 and CDK4 in cells treated with fucoidan, suggesting that the induced G0/G1
    arrest is due to suppression of CDK activity following direct binding of this
    CDK inhibitor to CDKs 2 and 4 .', Table 1 summarizes findings of studies examining
    the effects of fucoidan on cell cycle., Apoptosis characterized by cytoplasmic
    shrinkage and chromatin condensation facilitates the removal of cells without
    inducing inflammation ., 'Apoptosis occurs through either the extrinsic pathway
    whereby death receptors trigger the apoptosis, or the intrinsic pathway in which
    changes in mitochondrial membrane potential lead to cytochrome C release and death
    signal activation.', Both pathways activate executive caspases that cleave regulatory
    and structural molecules ., 'Several studies examining a variety of cancers such
    as hematopoietic, lung, breast and colon cancers have shown that fucoidan-mediated
    cell death occurs through triggering apoptosis .', 'A very low dose of fucoidan
    from F. vesiculosus activated common caspases 3 and 7 in human colon cancer cells
    , whereas it induced the same activity in T-cell leukemia at a much higher concentration
    .', 'Caspase 8 and 9, two of the best characterized molecules of the extrinsic
    and intrinsic pathways respectively are activated by fucoidan .', Yamasaki-Miyamoto
    et al., showed that pre-treatment with caspase 8 inhibitor completely blocked
    fucoidan mediated apoptosis in MCF-7 breast cancer cell line ., 'In contrast,
    in Zhang et al.', 'study, the mediated apoptosis by fucoidan from Cladosiphon
    okamuranus in MCF-7 human breast cancer cell line was shown to be caspase independent.',
  'As cytochrome C and apoptosis inducing factor increased in the cytosol, it was
    concluded that fucoidan performed its activity through mechanisms altering mitochondrial
    function.', Fucoidan also affects other components of extrinsic and intrinsic
    pathways., "Analyzing the extrinsic pathway, 20 \xB5g/mL crude fucoidan from F.
    vesiculosus increased the levels of the death receptors Fas, DR5 and TRAIL but
    not FasL and DR4 in human colon cancer cell lines .", 'Bcl-2 family members include
    anti-apoptotic, pro-apoptotic and regulatory proteins, which are mainly involved
    in the apoptosis intrinsic pathway.', Contradictory results have been described
    in the expression of these regulatory molecules in response to fucoidan., "Treatment
    of MDA-MB231 breast cancer cells with 820 \xB5g/mL of low molecular weight fucoidan
    resulted in a significant decrease in anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2, Bcl-xl and
    Mcl-1 .", "In contrast, no changes in expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-xl, Bad, Bim and
    Bik were observed in colon cancer cells when they were treated with 20 \xB5g/mL
    fucoidan from Fucus vesiculosus .", 'Taken together, the results suggest that
    fucoidan may interact with several components of the apoptosis pathway.', Fucoidan
    inhibits the formation of new vessels by which tumor cells receive their oxygen
    and required nutrients., 'Fucoidan has been found to inhibit the binding of VEGF,
    a key angiogenesis promoting molecule, to its cell membrane receptor .', Xue et
    al., examined the anti-angiogenic properties of fucoidan in 4T1 mouse breast cancer
    cells both in vitro and in vivo and observed a significant dose-dependent decrease
    in VEGF expression in cells treated with fucoidan., 'Further, in a mouse breast
    cancer model using 4T1 cells, intraperitoneal injections of 10 mg/kg body weight
    fucoidan from F. vesiculosus for 20 days markedly reduced the number of microvessels.',
  'Using immunohistochemistry, fucoidan was shown to reduce VEGF expression compared
    to the control group .', 'In contrast, Zhu et al.', "reported that fucoidan did
    not suppress angiogenesis and VEGF expression in human hepatocarcinoma cell lines
    treated with 10 to 200 \xB5g/mL of a commercial fucoidan purified from Sargassum
    spp.", Similarly no changes in VEGF expression were observed in xenograft tumors
    developed in nude mice following 20 to 200 mg/kg/body weight fucoidan injected
    intraperitoneally once a day over 25 days ., It is postulated that different effects
    are observed with fucoidans of various MWs and molecular structures and this is
    reviewed by Kwak ., 'In 1987, Coombe et al.', demonstrated that fucoidan significantly
    decreased tumor cells metastasis to the lungs in animals that were intravenously
    injected with rat mammary adenocarcinoma 13762 MAT cells ., It was first reported
    that fucoidan inhibits cell invasion through competing with tumor cell binding
    with laminin in the basement membrane ., Subsequent studies then revealed that
    fucoidan binds to fibronectin with high affinity and prevent attachment of tumor
    cells., 'In agreement with this study, fucoidan reduced the spread of human breast
    adenocarcinoma cells plated on a surface containing fibronectin .', "Selectin
    inhibition by fucoidan interferes with tumor cell\u2013platelet interaction.",
  In Cumashi et al., "study , highly metastatic MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were
    plated in platelet-coated plates in the presence or absence of 100 \xB5g/mL fucoidan.",
  The number of cells attached to the platelets decreased by 80% in the presence of
    fucoidan., Interaction of tumor cells with platelets is one of the key factors
    in facilitating the early steps of tumor cell migration., 'During tumor cell migration,
    most circulating tumor cells do not survive attack from immune cells or the shear
    forces of the blood stream.', 'However, they can attach to platelets to induce
    platelet aggregation allowing the tumor cell cluster to survive in the micro-vascular
    system.', It was concluded that fucoidan inhibited P-selectin residing on the
    platelet surface and led to reduced number of attached tumor cells., Fucoidan
    can also inhibit other adhesion molecules such as integrins residing on the tumor
    cell surface and can modify distribution of their subunits., 'Tumor invasion requires
    the secretion of proteolytic enzymes by tumor cells to break down the extracellular
    matrix proteins, with the matrix metalloproteinases MMP-2 and MMP-9 playing a
    major role.', Fucoidan attenuates both expression and activity of these enzymes
    ., The extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway is often hyperphosphorylated
    and upregulated in a variety of human cancers., "The potential for developing
    anticancer agents that cause ERK\u2019s dephosphorylation and pathway blockade
    have been explored.", Various studies have shown that fucoidan inhibits tumor
    cell proliferation by decreasing ERKs activity through reduction of its phosphorylation  while
    several studies have proposed that fucoidan causes ERK activation rather than
    inactivation ., 'To explain these contradictions, it should be noted that the
    ERK signaling pathway is highly complex.', 'It induces a range of different responses
    including cell proliferation, differentiation, migration and apoptosis depending
    on cell type, the type of stimulus and duration of activation .', 'Therefore,
    some of the contradictory results of the aforementioned studies can be explained
    by different fucoidan extracts with different molecular structures being used
    on different tumor cell types.', Another complication is that different studies
    have examined ERK phosphorylation over different time periods ranging from 10
    min to 48 h. Jin et al., "reported increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation in HL-60 leukemic
    cell line 10\u201315 min after fucoidan treatment.", The phosphorylation returned
    to the basal level after 1 h ., In Lee et al., 'study, crude fucoidan progressively
    diminished phosphorylation of ERK1/2 from 1 h to 9 h after treatment .', JNK and
    p38 are other MAPK superfamily members whose activity is altered by fucoidan.,
  Fucoidan induced cell death in breast cancer cells through phosphorylation and activation
    of JNK and p38 after 30 min., 'The fucoidan-induced apoptosis significantly annulled
    in the presence of JNK inhibitor, indicating critical role of JNK in fucoidan-mediated
    apoptosis .', Figure 1., Overview of main signal transduction pathways involved
    in cell proliferation and apoptosis., Figure 1., Overview of main signal transduction
    pathways involved in cell proliferation and apoptosis., 'Similarly, the PI3K/AKT,
    GSK and Wnt pathways have been shown to be triggered by fucoidan.', PI3K/AKT pathway
    generally inhibits apoptosis., AKT over-activation is also associated with drug
    resistance and tumor cell survival., 'As a result, deactivating this pathway could
    be another potential target for anti-cancer drug development.', Most of the studies
    have reported inactivation of AKT by fucoidan., 'PI3k, an upstream molecule of
    AKT, is also inhibited by fucoidan .', 'Upregulation of the Wnt signaling pathway
    is believed to have a critical role in prostate cancer development, survival and
    progression.', "Fucoidan from F. vesiculosus activated GSK-3\u03B2 in PC3 human
    prostate cancer cells resulting in hypo-phosphorylation and inactivation of \u03B2-catenin,
    a critical component of the Wnt pathway .", Figure 1 represents an overview of
    the mentioned signaling pathways., The effects of fucoidan on molecules of the
    immune system have been studied both in vitro and in vivo and effects on both
    cellular and humoral elements have been described., Fucoidan increases both activity
    and number of natural killer cells in vivo ., Increase in the number of cytotoxic
    T-cells has also been reported., A high-molecular-weight fucoidan from Cladosiphon
    okamuranus induced a large increase in the proportion of murine cytotoxic T cells
    ., Investigation of the role of fucoidan on dendritic cell-mediated T-cell cytotoxicity
    has revealed that the stimulation of CTLs was more effective in fucoidan-treated
    DCs as CTLs co-cultured with fucoidan-treated DCs exerted a high level of specific
    lysis of breast cancer cells ., 'In a recent study, the role of fucoidan in DCs
    function and its adjuvant effect have been examined in vivo.', Fucoidan was systemically
    administrated to mice by intraperitoneal injection., "Examination of the spleen
    DCs revealed up-regulation of maturation markers as well as production of IL-6,
    IL-12 and TNF-\u03B1.", Fucoidan was then used as an adjuvant in vivo with ovalbumin
    antigen and induced Th1 mediated immune response and CTL activation ., Few studies
    have reported the potential of fucoidan to inhibit neoplastic transformation.,
  Teas et al., 'fed rats with dietary seaweed for 55 days and administrated the carcinogen
    7,12-dimethylbenz(a) anthracene intragastrically.', 'Following 26 weeks monitoring,
    experimental rats showed a significant delay in the median time for tumor appearance
    .', "Transforming growth factor \u03B21 is believed to promote tumor development
    and metastasis through epithelial to mesenchymal transition, a process that enables
    epithelial cells migrate to distant areas during late stages of breast cancer
    development .", "To trigger tumor progression, TGF\u03B21 recruits TGF receptors
    residing on the cell surface.", "The investigations of effects of fucoidan on
    TGF\u03B21-promoted carcinogenesis in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells have indicated
    that fucoidan decreased the expression of TGFRs and affected the downstream signaling
    molecules, which are involved in TGF\u03B21-mediated EMT .", 'Epidermal growth
    factor is another carcinogenesis promoter, which induces tumor transformation
    through overexpression and activation of EGF receptor.', EGFR has a key role in
    cell proliferation and differentiation and many carcinomas arise from its mutations
    ., Lee et al., examined the role of fucoidan on the activation of EGFR and EGF-mediated
    neoplastic transformation ., They utilized murine JB6 Cl41 epidermal cells and
    induced cell transformation by EGF in the presence of fucoidan from L. guryanovae.,
  Fucoidan markedly reduced the EGFR activation through hypo-phosphorylation., 'It
    also inhibited EGF-tumorigenic activity through inhibition of AP-1, a transcription
    factor responsible for cell proliferation regulation.', 'Fucoidanase, the enzyme
    responsible for fucoidan hydrolysis, has only been found in brown seaweed and
    marine microorganisms such as some marine bacteria and fungi  and not in humans.',
  'It is possible that the acidic conditions in the stomach could degrade fucoidan,
    but it has been reported that the low gastric pH does have restricted effects
    on fucoidan .', Small amounts of dietary fucoidan can be endocytosed and cross
    the intestinal wall directly without breaking down ., In Tokita et al., 'study,
    10 volunteers were given oral fucoidan and the concentrations of fucoidan in the
    serum and urine were analyzed.', Fucoidan was detectable 3 h after administration
    and increased to 100 ng/mL in serum and 1000 ng/mL in urine., However the rate
    of absorption in the small intestine was highly variable among the participants.,
  The MW of fucoidan in serum was similar to administered fucoidan indicating that
    fucoidan was not hydrolyzed by digestive enzymes ., 'However, the MW of the fucoidan
    detected in urine was significantly smaller than the ingested fucoidan suggesting
    that fucoidan is degraded in the excretory system and possibly the kidney and
    not by intestinal enzymes or normal flora.', 'To evaluate the fucoidan uptake
    process by cells, the internalization of LMW fucoidan into rabbit smooth muscle
    cells was analyzed.', 'Fucoidan was shown to be internalized by endocytosis at
    6 h. The number of vesicles containing fucoidan increased in the peri-nuclear
    region at 24 h, but nuclear internalization was not observed at any time during
    the study .', 'However, examining the transport of a native fucoidan from Cladosiphon
    okamuranus with MW of 80 kDa revealed a poor permeation of fucoidan across the
    human colon adenocarcinoma Caco-2 cell monolayer .', 'Regarding the specific ligands
    by which fucoidan binds to the cells surface, several molecules have been implicated
    including class A macrophage scavenger receptors for fucoidan attachment to macrophages  as
    well as adhesion molecules such as L-selectin and P-selectin  and integrins .',
  'However, some reports have shown fucoidan mediates apoptosis through selectin-independent
    mechanisms .', The ability of fucoidan to synergize with standard anti-cancer
    agents and/or reduce toxicity has recently been investigated., Ikeguchi et al.,
  examined the synergistic effect of a HMW fucoidan with colorectal cancer chemotherapy
    agents; oxaliplatin plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin or irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin.,
  The test patients received 150 mL/day for 6 months of liquid that contained 4.05
    g fucoidan., 'From the commencement of chemotherapy, toxicities and chemotherapy
    efficiency were compared.', Fucoidan showed no side effects such as allergic dermatitis.,
  'Diarrhea, neurotoxicity and myelosuppression were not suppressed by fucoidan, whereas
    general fatigue was significantly decreased from 60% to 10%.', 'The patients were
    followed for approximately 15 months and the survival rate of the patients who
    received fucoidan was longer than that of the control participants; however the
    difference was not significant, probably due to the small numbers .', Fucoidan
    affects the migration and invasion of multiple myeloma cells treated with chemotherapy
    drug cytarabine., The human myeloma cell lines RPMI8226 and U266 were treated
    with crude fucoidan from F. vesiculosus for 72 h and then cytarabine for 6 h.
    Fucoidan reduced cell migration through a Boyden chamber and down-regulated expression
    of CXCR4 and MMP-9 ., Fucoidan from Saccharina cichorioides has been reported
    to synergize with the anti-tumor activity of low dose resveratrol on invasive
    and highly motile HCT 116 colon cancer cell line ., 'In the colony formation assay,
    fucoidan plus resveratrol reduced the colony number by 60% compared to 34% and
    27% in resveratrol alone or fucoidan alone, respectively.', Zhang et al., 'studied
    the combinatory effect of fucoidan and three commonly used anti-cancer agents;
    cis-platin, tamoxifen and paclitaxel on signal transduction pathways.', Fucoidan
    from Cladosiphon navae-caledoniae plus anti-cancer agents reduced the ERK phosphorylation
    in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells compared to untreated control or fucoidan alone
    ., 'Dietary fucoidan synergistically reduced cell growth in the OE33 cell line
    when it was combined with lapatinib, a targeted therapy that acts as a tyrosine
    kinase inhibitor in advanced HER2-positive breast cancer cells .', 'In a xenograft
    transplantation study, the effect of fucoidan alone or in combination with cyclophosphamide
    was examined on tumor growth.', 'Nine days after the injection of Lewis lung carcinoma
    cells into mice, fucoidan from Fucus evanescens was administered to animals alone
    or combined with cyclophosphamide.', The fucoidan group showed marked antitumor
    and anti-metastatic activities., 'However, fucoidan did not exhibit a synergistic
    effect with cyclophosphamide on tumor growth, but significantly decreased the
    lung cancer cells metastasis .', 'Despite the promising results about the anti-cancer
    effect of fucoidan, there are still challenges impeding utilization of fucoidan
    in the clinic.', Variable and contradictory results being influenced by endogenous
    and exogenous factors in fucoidan usage are of the main concerns., 'In this section
    we will summarize important conditions, which have been undertaken in different
    experiments and have led to such variable results in reported studies.', "Fucoidan
    is composed of \u03B1-(1-2) or \u03B1-(1-3)-linked L-fucose with a fucose content
    of 34-44%.", 'It also contains various amounts of other monosaccharaides such
    as galactose, mannose, xylose and uronic acid all of which make up less than 10%
    of the total fucoidan structure .', The sulfate groups in fucoidan structure are
    mainly at position 4 but they can also occupy position C2 and occasionally C3
    ., "The fucoidan structure and monosaccharide composition vary depending on different
    factors such as the source of fucoidan, the time and location of harvesting and
    the extraction method, which can affect the fucoidan\u2019s bioactivities.", Most
    anti-cancer studies of fucoidan have used a commercially available crude fucoidan
    extracted from Fucus vesiculosus., Some groups have extracted and purified fucoidan
    in their own laboratories., 'Okinawa mozuku, C. Okamuranus tokida, Sargassum sp.',
  and Undaria pinnatifida are the most common fucoidans examined in cancer studies.,
  Cumashi et al., studied different biological aspects of fucoidan from nine different
    species of brown seaweed in rats ., Analysis of P-selectin-mediated neutrophil
    adhesion to platelets revealed that extracted fucoidans from only some sources
    like F. evanescens and A. nodosum could serve as more efficient P-selectin inhibitors.,
  'Furthermore, in contrast to other sources, fucoidan from C. okamuranus did not
    exert anti-coagulant activity, which was suggested to be due to high content of
    2-O-a-d-glucuronyl substituent in the polysaccharide chain of fucoidan from C.
    okamuranus.', Sulfation is another key factor in fucoidan bioactivity., More sulfation
    is linked with greater bioactivity and thus researchers have produced over-sulfated
    fucoidans to enhance its biological properties ., It has been suggested that over-sulfation
    causes higher negative charge in the molecule which can facilitate formation of
    fucoidan-protein complexes involved in cell proliferation ., Molecular weight
    is another crucial factor in fucoidan activity., Cho et al., "produced three fucoidan
    fractions with molecular weights of ;5, 5\u201330 and &gt;30 kDa and reported
    that the F5-30K showed the most tumor growth inhibitory effect despite the sulfate
    amount in F&lt;5K being greater than in the two other fractions .", "The extraction
    method can also affect fucoidan\u2019s bio-properties.", Fucoidan from Undaria
    pinnatifida was hydrolyzed using different hydrolysis conditions and their anti-cancer
    activity was compared in vitro., The native fucoidan showed 37% anti-cancer activity;
    hydrolyzed fucoidan generated under mild conditions exhibited 75.9% anti-tumor
    activity; whereas hydrolyzed fucoidan generated under harsh conditions slightly
    enhanced the anti-cancer effect ., "As fucoidan is a large highly branched molecule,
    the dosage for in vitro studies mostly resides in the range of \xB5g/mL and not
    ng/mL.", 'However, there is a large variation in the doses.', Vischchuk et al.,
  "treated HCT-116 colon cancer cells with 100\u2013800 \u03BCg/mL fucoidan from the
    brown alga Saccharina cichorioides Miyabe and observed that fucoidan exerted a
    low cytotoxicity and there was less than 15% reduction in cell number with the
    high dose of 800 \u03BCg/ml after 24 h .", 'In contrast, Kim et al.', "demonstrated
    that 20 \u03BCg/mL fucoidan from F. vesiculosus caused 37% growth inhibition in
    the same cell line after 72 h .", 'Though the difference between incubation times
    should be considered, the dose difference was substantial.', The source of fucoidan
    appears to be the main factor leading to variation in results., 'Though most researchers
    have utilized dosages of less than 1 mg/mL, there are reports of use of up to
    3 mg/mL fucoidan.', 'Regarding the in vivo studies, both dose and the route of
    administration can affect outcome.', 'To select the most effective dose, mice
    were treated with various doses of fucoidan followed by total-body irradiation.',
  The mice injected with 100 mg/kg body weight fucoidan showed the best survival rate
    at 30 days post-irradiation ., Other studies have used various doses ranging from
    5 mg/kg to 100 mg/kg and occasionally doses up to 500 mg/kg/body weight of different
    fucoidan extracts., The amount and number of doses of fucoidan administration
    has also been shown to be important for in vivo studies., Alekseyenko et al.,
  studied mice with lung carcinoma that were treated with fucoidan from Fucus evanescence.,
  'They found that a single injection of 25 mg/kg/body weight of fucoidan did not
    inhibit tumor cell proliferation, while three-time injections of 10 mg/kg/body
    weight significantly reduced tumor growth and metastasis .', 'Most in vivo studies
    of anti-tumor activity have selected intraperitoneal injections, but subcutaneous
    or intravenous routes of administration have also been used.', Oral fucoidan is
    another route for in vivo delivery either for its anti-tumor properties following
    tumor induction or as a neoplastic transformation inhibitor administered prior
    to cancer induction., 'Taken together, these studies indicate that different delivery
    routes can affect the fucoidan metabolism in vivo and lead to variable outcomes.',
  'Whilst fucoidan consumed in food in the form of 4% of the total dry weight of brown
    seaweeds is generally regarded as safe, the fucoidan used for research is a highly
    purified extract.', 'For in vitro studies, researchers have utilized normal cells
    such as normal fibroblasts alongside tumor cell lines and reported that fucoidan
    did not induce apoptosis within normal cells at the doses which were toxic for
    cancer cell lines.', "A very high dose of 3 mg/mL fucoidan suppressed the viability
    of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy donors by 25% compared to 60%\u201390%
    in five different leukemic T-cells .", 'In vivo, oral administration of up to
    1 g/mL/body weight Undaria pinnatifida fucoidan was non-toxic in mice but higher
    doses induced changes in thyroid weight and altered levels of triglyceride and
    alanine transaminase activity .', 'In another study, daily administration of 300
    mg/kg/body weight fucoidan from Laminaria japonica in Wister rats over 6 months
    did not induce any adverse side effects, but higher doses resulted in coagulopathy
    and markedly elevated clotting time .', Toxicity has also been examined in the
    context of fucoidan use as adjuvant., Oh et al., examined the combinatory effect
    of fucoidan with the standard anti-Her2 inhibitor lapatinib in different breast
    cancer cell lines in vitro  and found that fucoidan decreased the efficiency of
    lapitinib and exerted antagonistic effects on cell proliferation in a few cell
    lines., 'Examining the effect of combination of fucoidan from Fucus evanescence
    with cyclophosphamide, 7 out of 10 mice that were injected with 25 mg/kg/body
    weight fucoidan plus cyclophosphamide died whereas of the mice that were treated
    with fucoidan alone, 3 out of 10 died .', Fucoidan has been examined in several
    clinical trials mainly for its anti-coagulant and anti-viral properties., Administration
    of capsules containing 560 mg fucoidan from Undaria pinnatifida for up to 24 months
    did not induce any side effect when the participants took 4 capsules a day .,
  In Mori et al., and Irhimeh et al., 'studies, daily consumption of 5 capsules contained
    166 mg fucoidan from C okamuranus Tokida for over one year and 3 g HMW fucoidan
    from Undaria pinnatifida for up to 12 days, respectively, were revealed to be
    safe.', 'However, Irhimeh et al.', 'demonstrated that orally administered fucoidan
    affected coagulation tests and prolonged the aPTT, thrombin time and AT-III.',
  "Other studies have also shown the potential of bleeding complication development
    due to fucoidan\u2019s anti-thrombotic property .", 'Diarrhea is another reported
    side effect, which was seen in 4 out of 17 participants within 1 month of daily
    administration of 6 g fucoidan .', 'When a blend of three different extracts,
    Macrocystis pyrifera, and Laminaria japonica) in capsules containing up to 187.5
    mg were daily given to volunteers, a statistically significant change in the potassium
    level was seen after 28 days.', 'Although, the change was minor and within the
    clinical reference range .', The goal of cancer treatment is eradication of tumor
    cells ideally with minimal damage to healthy tissues., 'Because of the side-effects
    of many current treatments, the use of natural substances of low toxicity is of
    interest.', A number of in vitro and in vivo studies have indicated that fucoidan
    contains strong anti-cancer bioactivity., 'Since fucoidan also possesses immunomodulatory
    effects, it is postulated that it may have protective effects against development
    of side effects when it is co-administered with chemotherapeutic agents and radiation.',
  'In this report, we reviewed the underlying cellular mechanisms by which fucoidan
    induces cell death within tumor cells and increases the survival rate of tumor-bearing
    animal models by suppression of metastasis and angiogenesis.', 'However despite
    numerous promising pre-clinical reports, there are few reported clinical studies
    so far .', 'In this review we also discussed the challenges impeding utilization
    of fucoidan in the clinic which include the complex heterogeneous structure of
    fucoidan, highly variable doses, different administration routes and possible
    negative interactions with chemotherapy.', 'Due to the wide variation of fucoidan
    structure and to make future experiments reproducible, it is recommended that
    the critical bioactivity factors such as fucoidan content, sulfate content, monosaccharide
    constituents and molecular weight be reported.', Attention to these factors will
    be likely to lead to more consistent reports and ultimately produce the required
    evidence to underpin clinical studies in near future., FA conducted the literature
