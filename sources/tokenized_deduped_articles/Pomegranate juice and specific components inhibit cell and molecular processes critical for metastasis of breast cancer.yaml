[Breast cancer is the most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death
    and morbidity among women in the western world., Pomegranate juice and three of
    its specific components have been shown to inhibit processes involved in prostate
    cancer metastasis., 'If this also proves to be true for breast cancer, these natural
    treatments will be promising agents against breast cancer that can serve as potentially
    effective and nontoxic alternatives or adjuncts to the use of conventional selective
    estrogen receptor modulators for breast cancer prevention and treatment.', 'To
    test this possibility, we have used two breast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-231 cells
    and MCF7, and the non-neoplastic cell line MCF10A.', 'We show that, in addition
    to inhibiting growth of the breast cancer cells, PJ or a combination of its components
    luteolin + ellagic acid + punicic acid increase cancer cell adhesion and decrease
    cancer cell migration but do not affect normal cells.', "These treatments also
    inhibit chemotaxis of the cancer cells to SDF1\u03B1, a chemokine that attracts
    breast cancer cells to the bone.", "We hypothesized that PJ and L + E + P stimulate
    expression of genes that increase adhesion and inhibit genes that stimulate cell
    migration and inhibit chemotaxis to SDF1\u03B1.", 'Using qPCR, we confirmed these
    proposed effects on gene expression and in addition we found that a gene important
    in epithelial-to-meshenchymal transitions is decreased.', 'We also found that
    pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines are significantly reduced by these treatments,
    thereby having the potential to decrease inflammation and its impact on cancer
    progression.', Discovery that PJ and L + E + P are inhibitory of metastatic processes
    in breast cancer cells in addition to prostate cancer cells indicate that they
    are potentially a very effective treatment to prevent cancer progression in general.,
  Breast cancer continues to be the most common cancer and the second leading cause
    of cancer death and morbidity among women in the western world ., 'Each year there
    are more than 10,000 new cases and more than 40,000 women die from this disease
    .', 'As a result, it becomes of primary importance to search for new therapeutic
    agents that may lead to better disease-free and overall survival.', 'Chemopreventive
    agents, tamoxifen and raloxifene, have been shown to reduce the risk of estrogen
    receptor positive breast cancers by 50 % in high-risk women but, unfortunately,
    their use is associated with major side effects.', 'In addition, they do not prevent
    ER negative breast cancers.', 'Despite significant improvement in early diagnosis,
    aggressive surgical treatment and application of additional nonsurgical modalities,
    many patients experience disease recurrence as a consequence of drug resistance
    .', 'Over the past decade, the use of new therapeutic approaches based on plant-derived
    natural products for the prevention and treatment of cancer has increased in the
    United States.', 'Pomegranate is a rich source of many phenolic compounds including
    flavonoids like anthocyanins, hydrolyzable tannins, flavonols, and flavones.',
  'These pomegranate compounds appear to exhibit anti-inflammatory and therapeutic
    effects on human breast cancer cells that could serve as effective, yet nontoxic,
    alternatives, or adjuncts to the use of conventional treatment for breast cancer
    .', Some of the initial studies on pomegranate extracts showed that these extracts
    had significant anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects against MCF-7 and
    MD-MBA-231 or MD-MBA-435 human breast cancer cell lines ., The most recent studies
    involving Pomegranate juice or its components focus primarily on its anti-proliferative
    and apoptotic effects on breast cancer ., These studies show that pomegranate
    extracts or some of its specific polyphenolic components have growth inhibitory
    effects on breast cancer cells and can even prevent the proliferation of cancer
    stem cells ., 'In their study, Wang et al.', "indicate that the inhibitory effect
    of luteolin on the growth of MCF-7 cells occurs via inhibition of the IGF-1-mediated
    PI3K\u2013Akt pathway dependent on ER\u03B1 expression.", Another recent study
    with luteolin suggests that it induces a caspase-dependent and caspase-independent
    apoptosis involving AIF nuclear translocation mediated by activation of ERK and
    p38 in breast cancer cells ., 'It also has been shown  that pomegranate ellagitannin-derived
    compounds are anti-proliferative and inhibit aromatase, an enzyme critically involved
    in the conversion of androgen to estrogen.', These authors suggest that these
    compounds may have the potential to affect estrogen-responsive breast cancers.,
  Studies with punicic acid have shown that this component of the juice inhibits breast
    cancer cell proliferation through its lipid peroxidation properties and also by
    affecting the PKC pathway ., The work we present here goes beyond these findings
    by showing that PJ and its components have an affect on several critical processes
    involved in breast cancer metastasis., 'PJ is rich in antioxidants in particular
    in punicalin, acid, caffeic acid, ellagic acid, and luteolin .', "Our group has
    previously shown that the aqueous portion of PJ stimulates adhesion, inhibits
    growth and migration of DU 145 and PC3 cells and inhibits chemotaxis of these
    prostate cancer cells towards SDF1\u03B1 , a chemokine known to be involved in
    metastasis of hormone refractory prostate cancer cells to the bone .", All of
    these processes are critical for cancer metastasis., 'However, the soluble phase
    of PJ contains many components that vary with variety, cultivation, extraction,
    etc., and therefore it is difficult to determine how best to maximize its use
    in treating prostate cancer.', 'A short communication reported that luteolin,
    ellagic acid, caffeic acid, and punicic acid, inhibit in vitro invasion of human
    prostate cancer cells across matrigel .', 'However, despite these very interesting
    results this study was very limited and showed only the results of a few chemotaxis
    chamber invasion assays.', 'Using these components, we showed that L + E + P together
    mimic the anti-metastatic effect of the whole juice, whereas C was ineffective
    .', 'Because loss of adhesion, increase in migration and increase in chemotaxis
    are hallmarks of cancer metastasis, we hypothesized that the same three components
    were likely to affect these processes in breast cancer cells.', 'If so, these
    natural treatments will be promising agents not only against breast cancer but
    also potentially an effective treatment to prevent cancer progression in general.',
  "Using an ER+ cell line, an ER\u2212 cell line, and a normal breast cell line, we
    show here that PJ inhibits growth, increases adhesion, decreases migration, and
    inhibits chemotaxis to SDF1\u03B1 of the cancer cells but not of the normal cells.",
  We show further that L + E + P is equally effective., We conclude that these three
    components in combination strongly affect processes that are critical for growth
    and metastasis of breast cancer and potentially can be generalized to affect metastasis
    of other cancers., 'Given these findings, we also investigated what could be the
    possible mechanism of action of the PJ and its components and found that they
    stimulate molecules involved in cell adhesion and inhibit molecules involved in
    cell migration.', 'Furthermore, we also found that both the juice and the three
    components inhibit the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines in
    the cancer cells but not in the non-neoplastic cells.', Our findings strongly
    suggest that L + E + P can potentially be used to prevent growth and metastasis
    of breast cancer and could be used in chemoprevention and/or as a co-adjuvant
    to traditional therapy., 'MCF7, MDA-MB-231, and MCF10A human cell lines were purchased
    from ATCC and cultured according to the procedures provided by the company.',
  MCF7 is an estrogen/progesterone receptor positive cell line., 'The MDA-231 cell
    line is ER/progesterone receptor negative and is associated with an aggressive
    cancer phenotypes with increased invasion, and motility.', This cell line demonstrates
    marked tumorigenicity with increased metastatic potential in vivo., The MCF10A
    line consists of spontaneously immortalized mammary epithelial cells and was used
    as non-neoplastic control., "MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured at 37 \xB0C

  'The number of proliferative cells on the plate was accessed by trypsinization after

    by measuring the distance migrated by the cells from the wounded edge to the leading

    MCF10A cells was not affected by either treatment., 'p &lt; 0.001;  p &lt; 0.01;  p

    In this study, we used two breast cancer cell lines that have been used previously
    in many other breast cancer studies.', 'We show the biological effects, both cellular
    and molecular, of PJ and some of its specific components in these breast cancer
    cell lines.', "We find that PJ or L + E + P: increases adhesion of the breast
    cancer cells; inhibits the migratory capability of these cells; inhibits their
    chemotaxis toward SDF1\u03B1; stimulates the expression of genes involved in cell
    adhesion and inhibits expression of genes involved in cell migration and in epithelial-to-mesenchymal
    transition; reduces the level of pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines while increasing
    the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines.", None of these effects was observed
    in the non-neoplastic MCF10A breast epithelial cell line., All together these
    results provide compelling evidence that PJ and its components L + E + P specifically
    target breast cancer cells without toxicity to non-cancerous breast epithelial
    cells., 'Furthermore, despite the fact that MDA-MB-231 are highly aggressive invasive
    cells and the MCF7 cells are not as aggressively invasive, the response of the
    two cell types to PJ or L + E + P treatment is very similar, strongly suggesting
    that these effects of the juice are not ER dependent.', 'The current model of
    human breast cancer progression proposes a linear multi-step process which initiates
    as flat epithelial atypia, progresses to atypical ductal hyperplasia, evolves
    into ductal carcinoma in situ and culminates in the potentially lethal stage of
    invasive ductal carcinoma.', 'In this cancer progression, stationary cancer cells
    transform into migratory cells in a process that involves loss of adhesion and
    rearrangement of cytoskeletal elements that allow the cells to migrate and invade
    .', Our results show that PJ or L + E + P can inhibit cell movement by increasing
    cell adhesion molecules and decreasing molecules that facilitate cell migration.,
  "Although the ratios of L + E + P in the juice are 1:50\u2013200:4, we find that
    the use of equal proportion of the components is more effective to inhibit the
    cellular and molecular processes presented here.", Increase in the expression
    of genes involved in cell adhesion and down-regulation of genes that stimulate
    migration is shown by qPCR., 'In breast cancer cells, claudin 1, the major component
    of the tight junctions in epithelial cells, prevents the cells from being able
    to separate from each other, invade other tissues and metastasize.', "PJ and L
    + E + P stimulate intercellular adhesion molecule-1, important in stabilization
    of cell\u2013cell adhesion, and myristoylated alanine-rich protein kinase C substrate,
    an actin-binding protein that normally associates with the plasma membrane where
    vinculin and talin are present in focal adhesions .", The treatment of the breast
    cancer cells with PJ and L + E + P downregulates the expression of HMMR., 'This
    molecule functions as a hyaluronan receptor and the binding of HA to HMMR can
    stimulate the RhoA-activated protein kinase signal transduction pathway, leading
    to tumor cell migration and invasion in various cancers .', 'In addition, PJ or
    L + E + P downregulates anillin and nexillin, actin-binding proteins that are
    known to be involved in regulation of the structure of the cytoskeleton , and
    N-chimearin, GTPase-activating protein that, when down-regulated, results in loss
    of filopodia and reduction of migration .', "Also, treatment with PJ or L + E
    + P downregulates TWIST, a basic\u2013helix-loop-helix transcription factor that
    has been implicated in the loss of cell adhesion and increased cell motility that
    are characteristics of EMT .", 'Apart from the genes described here that might
    mediate the effects of PJ or L + E + P on cell adhesion, migration and chemotaxis,
    we also find that these treatments act on breast cancer cell migration through
    significantly increasing E-cadherin, a molecule that is important in cell adhesion,
    ensuring that cells in epithelia are adherent to each other , and decreasing HMMR
    and TWIST levels.', We also find that cell transfection with E-cadherin siRNA
    or with a vector that overexpresses HMMR or TWIST partially reverses the inhibitory
    effects of PJ or L + E + P on cancel cell migration., The cytokine array results
    show that pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines known to promote tumor growth
    and cancer progression  are inhibited by PJ or L + E + P treatment., "Among the
    pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines examined with Luminex Multiplex Array assays,
    the secreted levels of IL-8, RANTES, and PDGFB, are significantly reduced by PJ
    or L + E + P treatment in both ER+ and ER\u2212 cells.", IL-8 is a potent leukocyte
    chemoattractant and has also been shown to contribute to human cancer progression
    through its potential functions as a mitogenic and angiogenic factor ., 'Overexpression
    of IL-8 is associated with increasing tumor stage and disease progression and
    recurrence in human melanoma, breast, gastric, ovarian, and prostate cancer .',
  'Furthermore, there is a direct correlation between high levels of IL-8 and tumor
    angiogenesis, progression, and metastasis in nude xenograft models of human cancer
    cells .', 'RANTES is a potent chemotactic factor for T cells, monocytes and dendritic
    cells.', 'Expression of RANTES and its receptor, CCR5, have been shown to correlate
    with cancer progression .', 'In addition, interaction of RANTES with CCR5 on the
    surface of cancer cells stimulates their invasive capabilities .', PDGFBB is a
    well-known mitogenic and pro-angiogenic factor and has been shown to potentiate
    cancer growth and progression ., 'Also, the more aggressive cell line, MDA-MB-231,
    when treated with PJ or L + E + P, showed marked decrease in fractalkine.', 'Fractalkine
    can exist either in a soluble form, like all the other chemokines, or as a cell
    membrane molecule.', Recent evidence has implicated this chemokine and its cognate
    receptor CX3CR1 in cancer., 'Tumors of neural origin express CX3CR1 which is involved
    in the adhesion, transendothelial migration and mobilization of tumor cells .',
  'In addition, tumors of non-neural origin, like prostate, pancreas, and breast carcinoma
    express high levels of the CX3CR1 receptor .', CX3CR1 expression is associated
    with increased migration and site-specific dissemination., 'Moreover, fractalkine
    activates the PI3K/Akt survival pathway in cancer cells .', These findings seem
    to indicate that the observed anti-metastatic effects of PJ or L + E + P on breast
    cancer cells are in part mediated through reducing the production of cancer-related
    pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines., 'Interestingly, the effects of PJ
    or L + E + P on breast cancer cell lines are in sharp contrast to the observation
    on the non-neoplastic control cells, MCF10A, where the PJ or its components seem
    to have no significant effect.', This raises the exciting possibility of a window
    of therapeutic opportunity for preferentially eliminating breast cancer cells
    with minimal damage to the surrounding normal mammary tissue., 'All together,
    our findings show, for the first time, that PJ in general and L + E + P in particular
    interfere with multiple biological processes involved in metastasis of breast
    cancer cells such as suppression of cell growth, increase in cell adhesion, inhibition
    of cell migration and inhibition of chemotaxis towards proteins that are important
    in breast cancer metastasis.', 'Our findings presented here, when coupled with
    the similar results on prostate cancer in our laboratory and elsewhere, strongly
    suggest these results will be applicable to other cancers.', We thank Dr. E. Turley
