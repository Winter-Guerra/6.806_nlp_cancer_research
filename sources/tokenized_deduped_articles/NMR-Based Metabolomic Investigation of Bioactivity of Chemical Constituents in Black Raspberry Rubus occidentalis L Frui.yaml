[Black raspberry fruit extracts with differing compound profiles have shown variable
    antiproliferative activities against HT-29 colon cancer cell lines., This study
    used partial least-squares regression analysis to develop a high-resolution 1H
    NMR-based multivariate statistical model for discerning the biological activity
    of BR constituents., This model identified specific bioactive compounds and ascertained
    their relative contribution against cancer cell proliferation., 'Cyanidin 3-rutinoside
    and cyanidin 3-xylosylrutinoside were the predominant contributors to the extract
    bioactivity, but salicylic acid derivatives, quercetin 3-glucoside, quercetin
    3-rutinoside, p-coumaric acid, epicatechin, methyl ellagic acid derivatives, and
    citric acid derivatives also contributed significantly to the antiproliferative
    activity of the berry extracts.', This approach enabled the identification of
    new bioactive components in BR fruits and demonstrates the utility of the method
    for assessing chemopreventive compounds in foods and food products., 'NMR; black

    Secondary compounds in plant-based foods include well-known antioxidants(1) that
    function on several metabolic levels to reduce oxidative stress and to regulate
    signal transduction pathways, transcription factor function, gene expression,
    enzyme activity, and other cellular and subcellular processes that moderate inflammatory
    responses associated with the onset and development of chronic diseases.', '(2-8)
    To accomplish their roles, these bioactive compounds likely act in concert rather
    than independently.', '(4-6) Moreover, even simple fruit extracts may contain
    hundreds of secondary plant compounds from several compound classes, of which
    a select few may interact to induce a therapeutic response.', '(9) Therefore,
    using metabolomics or metabolomics-based approaches(10, 11) involving partial
    least-squares regression analysis and/or other statistical procedures(12) to identify
    specific bioactive phytonutrients and to define their role in moderating disease
    may have significant advantages over more traditional investigative techniques
    by which compound bioactivities are investigated sequentially.', 'Clinical research
    with animal/human models and subjects provides compelling evidence that black
    raspberries contain bioactive compounds that have complex chemopreventive properties
    with regard to aerodigestive cancers(2, 5-8) and other cancers.', '(2, 13, 14)
    Although these classical studies have identified several important chemopreventive
    constituents of BR derivatives including anthocyanins(2, 7, 8) and nonanthocyanin
    phenols such as ellagic acid, ferulic acid, gallic acid, p-coumaric acid, flavonols,
    and their derivatives,(5) the total impact of the treatments could not be accounted
    for by any single compound or single group of constituents.', "(2, 7, 15) Therefore,
    the body of evidence confirming the potential efficacy of BR-based clinical treatments
    and the current level of knowledge about their apparent bioactive constituents
    offered a unique opportunity to develop analytical model systems that delineate
    plant constituent\u2013therapeutic response relationships.", 'To meet this challenge,
    we developed a model system that compares the 1H NMR spectra of relatively crude
    BR extracts with the cellular proliferation of HT-29 human colon cancer cells.',
  Our approach to modeling linked variable bioassay results to variation in plant
    sample extract secondary metabolite complements and employed multivariate statistical
    analyses to identify specific regions of the extract NMR spectra that were associated
    with the array of biological responses., 'Once spectral regions responsible for
    these relationships were identified by the model, compound structures were verified
    using 2D NMR methods, such as heteronuclear single-quantum coherence(16) and heteronuclear
    multiple-bond correlation(17) experiments.', 'To validate this approach, we first
    ensured that BR extract profile variability could be achieved by capitalizing
    upon the genetic and environmental influences on fruit composition.', '(18, 19)
    In addition, we verified that specific signals within complex NMR profiles responsible
    for known chemical relationships could be identified through multivariate statistical
    analyses.', 'Specifically, we regressed BR extract NMR profiles against standard
    biochemical analyses .', (20) This verification model successfully recognized
    the specific protons within the NMR spectra associated with anthocyanins that
    played significant roles in the activity of extracts in these assays., "Furthermore,
    the model found structure\u2013activity relationships to be statistically identifiable.",
  Here we have applied our system to model the biological relationship between bioactive
    compound variability among 73 BR extracts and their ability to inhibit HT-29 colon
    cancer cell proliferation., We previously reported the effects of these extracts
    on cancer cell cultures in this study., '(21) The variable BR juice extracts inhibited
    HT-29 colon cancer cell growth broadly from 33 to 118% when included in the culture
    media at low and high doses of 0.6 or 1.2 mg extract/mL, respectively.', 'Cell
    responses were dose-dependent, and the response arrays between doses were highly
    correlated.', "Although anthocyanins are known to contribute substantially to
    BR\u2019s chemoprotective properties,(2, 5-8) extract anthocyanin concentrations
    as measured by TMA were not correlated to levels of growth inhibition, suggesting
    that nonanthocyanin components also contribute to BR extract bioactivity in the
    HT-29 colon cancer cell assay.", 'Recently, we identified a cadre of nonanthocyanins
    present in our extracts, some of which had yet to be reported as BR constituents.',
  '(22)


    In this paper, we present the description of anthocyanin as well as nonanthocyanin
    compounds identified by our modeling system that are responsible for the antiproliferative
    properties of BR extracts within the HT-29 colon cancer cell bioassay.', Our model
    also indicates that compounds of various classes present in extracts over a broad
    concentration range may act together to affect cancer cell growth., Marketable
    BR fruit samples of three cultivars varying in ripeness(21) from seven Ohio commercial
    farms were obtained for this study., Fruit were hand-harvested in fiber-board
    containers and transported on ice to the Ohio Agricultural Research and Development
    Center., Sample extracts from 75 samples for both NMR and cell assay procedures
    were prepared as described by Johnson and coauthors., '(21) This process included
    the following steps: sample handling, over-ripening fruit, sample storage, preparation
    of BR juices, isolation of secondary product constituent-rich methanolic extracts
    via solid phase extraction, evaporation of solvents under an N2 stream, and freeze-drying
    of solvent-free SPE column eluates.', 'All NMR studies of BR extract samples were
    performed with a Varian INOVA 750 MHz NMR spectrometer using a Varian triple-resonance
    1H{13C/15N} pulsed field gradient cryoprobe.', "Solid materials derived from the
    column eluate were diluted with appropriate amounts of methanol-d4/trifluoroacetic
    acid-d and 5 mM 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate sodium salt in methanol-d4
    to give 800 \u03BCL aliquots that contained 20 mg of dried berry extract and 0.5
    mM DSS.", The samples were filtered through glass wool and placed in 5 mm NMR
    tubes., "All samples were stored at 4 \xB0C prior to analysis.", Two of the 75
    samples were prepared incorrectly for NMR analysis and were excluded from further
    examination., "The spectra were collected at 25 \xB0C over a spectral width of
    9023 Hz using a 6.2 \u03BCs pulse.", "The acquisition time was 2.7 s, and 128
    transients were accumulated with presaturation of the HDO resonance in the 4.91\u20135.07
    ppm region.", 'Data were processed with 0.5 Hz exponential line broadening and
    zero filled to 131,072 points before Fourier transformation.', '1H NMR free induction
    decays were processed as a batch, using KnowItAll Metabolomics software 8.1 with
    a Lorentzian apodization of 0.3 Hz, baseline correction with automatic base point
    detection, and spline fitting.', The DSS reference peak was manually set to 0
    ppm for each spectrum., 'After the region containing solvent resonances had been
    flat-lined, each spectrum was normalized against the DSS peak.', Alignment macros
    were applied as a batch process to numerous specific locations along the spectrum
    to compensate for peak shifting due to variation in pH and in the constituent
    concentrations among samples., "Prior to statistical analysis, binning/bucketing
    was conducted from 0.550 to 9.200 ppm using the Bio-Rad IntelliBucket method,
    where the bin width was automatically adjusted on the basis of the overlap density
    heatmap consensus spectrum and a bin width setting of 0.004 \xB1 0.002 ppm.",
  "Regions that were excluded from binning were as follows: 4.910\u20135.070 ppm;
    3.257\u20133.373 ppm; highly overlapping peaks of the saccharide region; and regions
    throughout the spectrum of low signal/noise.", 'However, all regions containing
    resonances for anomeric protons were included in the binning process.', This resulted
    in a data set of 1003 bins from each of 73 BR extract samples that was further
    reduced to 464 bins by selecting bins with intensities above the analytically
    justified limit of quantitation(23)., The PLS regression-based predictive model
    building using Pirouette 4.0 started with the 464 bin data sets., Peak intensities
    of bins for each of the 73 BR samples were regressed against the bioassay responses(21)
    as shown in Table S1 in the Supporting Information., A maximum number of 15 factors
    and a probability threshold of 0.95 were set., 'Two-component orthogonal signal
    correction(24) was used to remove components in our large X block that were orthogonal
    to the Y block, thus segregating the portion of the X block that was correlated.',
  'To aid the interpretation of chemical information from the regression models, one
    subset of relevant variables was selected from the entire block of X-variables.',
  The criteria for variable selection were software-dependent measures of fit ., 'The
    regression vector values from this subset of bins were then ranked from highest
    to lowest for the low- and high-dose bioassays, respectively.', 'Classical biochemical
    studies of chemoprevention and cancer cell antiproliferation, in response to berry
    fruits and BR in particular, are challenging because several berry fractions and
    many specific secondary products have been shown to have some effect on the cancer
    cell performance, but no single fraction or compound can account for the efficacy
    of whole fruit or crude fruit extracts.', "(2, 7) Our approach uses \u201Comics\u201D
    and bioinformatic procedures to identify active components by NMR spectroscopy
    and to link them to their impact on cell proliferation in HT-29 colon cancer cells
    in a manner similar to that described by Leiss et al.", (25) and Gavaghan et al.,
  '(26) to determine important effectors of host-plant resistance and maize salt stress,
    respectively.', 'Because many BR secondary compounds have been shown to have roles
    in BR regulation of cancer cell development, there exists a large body of data
    for the potential verification of the compounds identified by the model.', 'Modeling
    of secondary product chemistry, in conjunction with medical efficacy, provides
    an opportunity to examine complex mixtures of secondary products that are present
    in plant materials and determine how they affect cell health, chemoprevention,
    and/or cancer cell proliferation.', 'NMR is a powerful method used to elucidate
    chemical structures of molecules; here we have used it to identify components
    of complex mixtures of small molecule metabolites simultaneously, at a high resolution.',
  'Moreover, samples were readily prepared in a reproducible manner without the need
    for additional separation techniques.', Processing the data with KnowItAll statistical
    software permitted the BR components that play significant roles in the control
    of HT-29 cell proliferation to be identified., 'Our model generated large blocks
    of data concerning the chemical nature of the extracts, which were evaluated against
    a complex series of chemical reactions that we monitored as cell proliferation.',
  'The impact of these secondary compounds on cell proliferation represents the sum
    of all of the reactions controlling cell growth, metabolism, and apoptosis that
    have been demonstrated by a host of research.', '(2, 5, 7, 8, 15)



    Model development was initiated by obtaining the 1H NMR spectra of the 73 BR extracts.',
  The spectra of three representative BR extract samples are shown in Figure 1 .,
  "In all 1H spectra of BR extract samples, the HDO resonance from water that had
    been observed in the 4.91\u20135.07 ppm region was suppressed using a presaturation
    pulse sequence.", 'The singlet peak at 0.0 ppm is from DSS, which was added as
    an internal standard for chemical shift measurement as well as a calibration standard
    for quantitation.', 'The strong peaks centered at 3.31 ppm, 3.35 ppm, and 3.97
    ppm are attributed to the resonances of residual CHD2OD from methanol-d4, a solvent-like
    impurity, and an artifact compound, respectively.', "The resonances in the complex
    region, 4.00\u20133.22 ppm, are attributed to nonanomeric resonances from the
    saccharides that are attached to the phenolic structures.", The suppression of
    these signals and the regions of low signal-to-noise ratios in the initial data
    sets were made to ensure a robust analysis., Figure 1., '750 MHz 1H NMR spectra
    of three representative methanolic BR juice extract samples: sample BR-2 from
    slightly under-ripe berries; sample BR-47 from ripe berries; sample BR-28 from
    slightly over-ripe berries.', Resonances from anthocyanins are indicated in purple
    and those from nonanthocyanins are indicated in green bars above the chemical
    shift scale., 'The spectra of BR extract samples are dominated by the resonances
    from cyanidin 3-glycosides as well as defining peaks for cyanidin 3-rutinoside,
    cyanidin 3-xylosylrutinoside, cyanidin 3-glucoside, and cyanidin 3-sambubioside,
    the major phenolic antioxidants of BR fruits.', '(19) The unique resonances from
    the minor anthocyanin, pelargonidin 3-rutinoside, are also detected.', 'In Figure
    1, the resonances from these anthocyanin phenolics are indicated in purple bars
    above the chemical shift scale.', Figure 2., Structures of the cyanidin aglycone
    and four major anthocyanin phenolic compounds of black raspberry., '1, cyanidin

    3-glucoside; and 5, cyanidin 3-sambubioside.', Several resonances from nonanthocyanin
    metabolites and the aliphatic moieties associated with citric acid derivatives
    were also observed., 'The structures of nonanthocyanin phenolics, which were readily
    detected in the 1H NMR spectra of BR extracts, are shown in Figure 3.', Compounds
    based on the quercetin moiety included quercetin 3-glucoside and quercetin 3-rutinoside.,
  'Compound 11, salicylic acid glucosyl ester, where the glucose moiety is attached
    to a salicylic acid, was also evident.', "Additional nonanthocyanin compounds
    that have been detected in the 1H NMR spectra of BR extract samples are epicatechin,
    benzoic acid \u03B2-d-glucopyranosyl ester, a salicylic acid derivative, p-coumaric
    acid, and methyl ellagic acid acetylpentose.", Figure 3., Structures of a citric
    acid derivative and nonanthocyanin phenolics detected in BR juice extract samples

    salicylic acid derivative; 15, p-coumaric acid; and 16, methyl ellagic acid acetylpentose.',
  "Although these minor metabolites are present at concentrations approximately 10\u20132\u201310\u20133
    times the concentrations of the cyanidin 3-glycosides,(5) some of their proton
    resonances are clearly visible in the 1H NMR spectra of the BR extracts.", 'For
    example, the H-8 and H-6 resonances from the quercetin glycosides, namely, Q 3-rut
    and Q 3-glc, are seen at 6.39 and 6.20 ppm, respectively.', "Likewise, for SAGE,
    one of the readily detected resonances is H-1\u2032, the anomeric proton resonance
    from the glucose attached to the phenolic structure via an ester linkage.", Our
    model simultaneously analyzed a number of regions of the 1D 1H NMR spectra to
    ensure that participating components of the BR could be identified., 'This approach
    was demanding, because several proton resonances can be associated with one compound
    and intensities may differ depending on the number of protons in the compound
    structural unit.', 'In addition, similarities in structures can result in overlapping
    peaks yielding complex spectral patterns.', 'To verify structures, especially
    for compounds present at low concentrations, additional NMR experiments such as
    1D selective total correlation spectroscopy, TOCSY, and 2D-NMR were conducted.',
  'Furthermore, during the statistical analysis, the NMR data were subjected to Pareto
    scaling,(27) where the square root of the standard deviation was used as a scaling
    factor.', This minimized the effect of larger intensities in the presence of much
    smaller intensities., 'To make regression modeling possible, we needed large amounts
    of variation in the extracts with a corresponding amount of variability in the
    cancer cell responses.', This methodology differs from traditional medicinal chemistry
    approaches in which consistency in treatments is essential to understanding experimental
    outcomes., "To verify the variability among our samples, the concentrations of
    cyanidin structures were obtained for all 73 spectra on the basis of the manual
    integration of the H-4 resonances using Bio-Rad\u2019s ProcessIt NMR application.",
  Normalized peak areas were obtained relative to the integration of the CH3 peak
    of DSS calibration standard at 0.0 ppm set to 100., These data revealed that the
    concentrations of the anthocyanin components in the 73 BR extract samples exhibited
    the desired high level of variability needed for our modeling efforts., 'In this
    study, Cy 3-xylrut was the most abundant phenolic component of the berry extracts,
    and the second most abundant component was Cy 3-rut.', 'In general, the amounts
    of Cy 3-xylrut and Cy 3-rut were higher in ripe samples than in the under-ripe
    samples, whereas the amounts of Cy 3-glc and Cy 3-sam both decrease with increasing
    ripeness.', 'Initially, a model of the low-dose assay was generated with a data
    set of 464 bins determined using Pareto scaling and leave-one-out cross-validation.',
  NMR bins were ranked according to their regression vector values., Subsets of the
    highest ranked bins were then created and modeled against the low-dose bioassay
    to determine the best fit of the NMR spectra to the extract impact on cell proliferation.,
  Figure 4a shows a plot of PRESS as well as r values against model sets with various
    numbers of X-variables., Figure 4b shows the corresponding line plot between model
    factors and number of bins., 'The arrows A4 and A5 represent the regions of minimum
    PRESS and maximum r, respectively.', 'Because the maximum number of bins does
    not exceed 2 times the number of samples, the minimum value of PRESS, maximum
    value of r, and minimum number of model factors are the quality indices of a good
    model.', A compromise among these quality indices indicated that the optimum number
    of bins for the low-dose bioassay was 125., The indicators of the fit for this
    five-factor model are shown in Table 1., This model has r and slope values approaching
    1 and values of the standard error of cross-validation and PRESS that approached
    their minima., 'In addition, Figure 5a shows the goodness of the Y-fit between
    predicted and measured values.', The random distribution of the residuals also
    indicates that the assumption of linearity between the X\- and Y-variables is
    warranted., Figure 4., 'Partial least-squares plots for the selection of X-variables:

    are taken from the best PLS model with 100 highest ranked X-variables from the
    first test model., 'When the top 125 bins of this model were ranked according
    to their regression vector values, the contribution of specific compounds became
    evident.', 'Because regression vectors are the weighted sum of loadings included
    in the model, they reveal the importance of each independent variable.', 'These
    predictor variables are the basis for interpreting the effect of NMR bins, which
    carry the information about the chemical components, on the dependent variable,
    percent inhibition of cell proliferation.', 'For the low-dose bioassay, Table
    2 shows some of these compounds by their defining atom assignments and their rank/bin
    number, with corresponding atomic assignments being illustrated in Figures 2 and
    3.', The complete table of all 125 bin assignments can be found in Table S3 in
    the Supporting Information., 'In Table 2, specific bins corresponding to each
    of the four major anthocyanins in BR are shown to be important with Cy 3-xylrut
    and Cy 3-rut as the top-ranked.', Cy 3-sam and Cy 3-glc also have an impact on
    bioassay results., A large number of bins were attributed to resonances of these
    cyanidin glycosides., Table 2., "Pirouette PLS Model Developed with the Top 125

    to augment inhibition of cell proliferation in the HT29 low-dose bioassay.", 'BR
    anthocyanins and nonanthocyanin phenolic compounds share some similarities in
    structure; therefore, their 1H NMR spectra would be expected to contain some overlapping
    resonances.', 'Although this overlap confounded compound identification, defining
    bins were found to be important for MEAAP, epicatechin, Q 3-rut, Q 3-glc, p-coumaric
    acid, SAGE, a salicylic acid derivative, BAGE, and citric acid derivatives.',
  'When a model was calculated for the high-dose bioassay, similar but not identical
    results were obtained.', 'This model was optimized at 100 bins, and indicators
    of fit are shown in Table 1 and Figure 5c,d.', 'When the 100 bins were ranked
    according to their regression vector values, a trend similar to the low-dose results
    was evident.', The highest ranked bin corresponded to Cy 3-xylrut and a defining
    bin for Cy 3-rut was ranked 11th., Bins consistent with Cy 3-sam and Cy 3-glc
    were also evident as well as a large number of bins that corresponded to resonances
    of cyanidin glycosides., The same nonanthocyanin compounds that affected the low-dose
    model were also evident., 'However, the rankings of these compounds, especially
    a citric acid derivative, differed from those in the low-dose model.', 'In general,
    many of the nonanthocyanin constituents appeared to gain in predictive value in
    the high-dose model.', Table 3., "Pirouette PLS Model Developed with Top 100 Bins
    Showing Bin Assignments, Chemical Shifts, and Rankings Based on Regression Vector
    Values for the Assessment of High-Dose Bioassay Activity of Black Raspberry Extracts
    \ \n\n\nOverall, the importance of the nonanthocyanins was evident.", 'As shown
    in Tables 2 and 3, of our original 1003 bins for each of 73 samples, the rankings
    of the NMR bins based on their regression vector values ranged from 30 to 121
    for the low-dose bioassay and from 6 to 81 for the high-dose bioassay.', 'Furthermore,
    error analyses of PLS models that were calculated using only anthocyanin-related
    bins proved to be less than optimal when compared to our PLS models containing
    both anthocyanin- and nonanthocyanin-related bins.', "As with other \u201Comics\u201D
    approaches, the cell assay, provided a simple phenotypic-like response to the
    treatments, here, control of the HT-29 colon cancer cell proliferation.", 'However,
    just as a simple phenotypic response is controlled by changes in many overlapping
    and/or independent biochemical pathways, cell proliferation reflects the combined
    impacts of the extract components on the stimulation of apoptosis, regulation
    of cell cycle gene expression, and the impact of BR extract components on overlapping
    and independent biochemical pathways.', 'Therefore, the model must integrate all
    of these interactions to determine the impact of the extracts on cancer cell growth.',
  This integration then provides data to identify compounds that affect any of a myriad
    of chemical reactions., Cy 3-xylrut and Cy 3-rut were identified by the model
    as the most important contributors to the inhibition of proliferation of HT-29
    colon cancer cells., Anthocyanins constitute a major group of phenolic antioxidants
    produced in most small fruits., '(28) According to Stoner,(5) anthocyanins are
    present in BR at concentrations that exceed those of ellagic acid by approximately
    15-fold and of all other phenolic materials by factors of 102 or 103.', 'BR anthocyanins
    are known to effectively intercede against various forms of aerodigestive cancers(2,
    5-8) at several stages by initiating and maintaining the enzymatic defenses against
    oxidative stress, reducing inflammation, and inhibiting mutagenesis, as well as
    decreasing cell proliferation and stimulating apoptosis.', '(8) BR anthocyanins
    or anthocyanin-rich fractions affect these chemopreventive processes at cellular
    and subcellular levels by direct interaction or interaction with controlling elements
    of kinase-based signaling cascades that influence gene expression, mRNA translation,
    or enzymatic activity of key cancer-related factors.', '(2, 4-8)


    However, the model data also support our previous conclusion that the antiproliferative
    effectiveness of these BR extracts is not directly correlated with their TMA contents.',
  '(21) When we compared the NMR-determined concentrations of individual anthocyanins
    herein with the low- and high-dose bioassay data using a simple Pearson correlation
    analysis, only the Cy 3-rut correlation values were significant.', 'However, this
    relationship was weak, suggesting that the effects of BR extracts on HT-29 colon
    cancer cell proliferation arise from the activity of multiple compounds in concert.',
  'Moreover, bins associated with protons of nonanthocyanin constituents appeared
    to gain in importance in the anthocyanin-rich extract/high-dose assay PLS model
    over their position in the model constructed with low-dose assay data developed
    with extracts containing lower levels of anthocyanins.', 'Together, these findings
    suggest that anthocyanins may reach a maximum effect on cells and that further
    increases in their total content or alterations in anthocyanin profiles may not
    increase the activity of the specific extract.', 'Supporting this contention,
    Seguin and co-workers(29) recently reported four temperate berries and a cyanidin-containing
    tropical fruit acai, presumably with differing anthocyanin profiles, to be similar
    in their antiproliferative activities.', 'In a study by Wang and co-workers,(7)
    dietary treatments with freeze-dried BR powder, an aqueous ethanol extract, and
    an anthocyanin-enriched subfraction of the extract were found to affect rat esophageal
    papilloma formation and mass, proteins associated with proliferation, and markers
    of apoptosis similarly.', Wang and co-workers(7) also noted similar antiproliferative
    properties associated with a diet formulated with the insoluble residue of the
    extraction with anthocyanin concentrations reduced by approximately 200-fold.,
  'These authors noted that among the potential nonanthocyanin constituents of the
    extract insoluble residue, ellagitannins were likely responsible for the chemoprotective
    effects of the residue diet.', 'Due to their low solubility in methanol, ellagitannins
    were likely to be present at minimal concentrations in our extracts.', 'However,
    our model clearly identified MEAAP as one of the important antiproliferative components
    of BR extracts.', 'The metabolism and chemoprotective properties of ellagic acid
    and its polymers, derivatives, and colonic microflora-generated metabolites were
    recently reviewed by Landete.', '(30) Similar to other polyphenols, these compounds
    act chemoprotectively by reducing the activity of signaling cascades, limiting
    inflammatory responses, controlling cell cycling and proliferation, reducing angiogenesis,
    and stimulating apoptosis.', '(8, 30)


    Our model also identified epicatechin, Q 3-glc, Q 3-rut, SAGE, SAD, BAGE, and
    p-coumaric acids as important BR extract components in the control of HT-29 cell
    proliferation.', 'Flavan-3-ols, flavonol glycosides, and salicylates are powerful
    phenolic antioxidants that have been shown to have chemopreventive properties
    against colon cancer(31-34) and other types of cancers.', '(3, 6, 31, 32, 34,
    35) In vitro cell assays and animal studies have shown these compounds inhibit
    proliferation or tumor growth by controlling cell cycle genes and enzymes and
    by promoting genes and enzymes associated with apoptosis.', 'In a study of bioactive
    constituents isolated from freeze-dried strawberry, Zhang and co-workers(34) demonstrated
    that a p-coumaric acid glucose ester strongly inhibited proliferation in two colon
    cancer cell line assays.', There is also evidence that hydroxycinnamic acids may
    play an active role in cancer cell regulation when acylated to anthocyanins.,
  (36) The chemopreventive activity of hydroxybenzoic acids and their derivatives
    has also been extensively studied., '(37) However, to our knowledge, this is the
    first report of a benzoic acid glucose ester showing antiproliferative potential
    against cancer cells.', "Altered metabolism favoring cytoplasm-centered \u201Caerobic
    glycolysis\u201D is an \u201Cemerging hallmark\u201D of cancer,(38) leading to
    the production of metabolites necessary for continued proliferation and sufficient
    energy for tumor growth.", '(39, 40) However, aerobic glycolysis and its effects
    can be curtailed by high levels of cytosolic citrate.', '(39-41) Elevated citrate
    levels in cancer cells may lead to cell cycle arrest, metabolic changes favoring
    pro-apoptotic over anti-apoptotic proteins, and increased cytosolic- or mitochondrial-induced
    caspase activity leading to cell death(39-42) in a threshold-dependent manner.',
  The increased importance of citric acid derivatives in the high-dose model perhaps
    reflects this concentration threshold dependency., The 1H NMR-based model that
    was developed here has made a significant contribution to our understanding of
    the impact of the crude BR extracts in controlling HT-29 cell proliferation and
    provides insights as to the chemopreventive nature of BR fruits., 'The nonanthocyanin
    components of the fruit that affect cell proliferation represent a very small
    percentage of the total phenolic and organic acid derivatives found in the BR
    extracts, but both the low- and high-dose models indicated their importance in
    curtailing cancer cell growth.', 'Among the model-identified nonanthocyanin components,
    Q 3-glc, Q 3-rut, p-coumaric acid, and various ellagic acid derivatives have been
    previously considered as bioactive constituents of BR.', '(4-8, 30, 43, 44) However,
    the bioactivity of MEAAP specifically, BR-derived salicylates, flavan-3-ols, citric
    acid derivatives, and/or esters of benzoic acid in controlling colon cancer cell
    proliferation have not been cited to our knowledge in previous work.', 'Recognition,
    by the model, of the contributions of these low-concentration constituents on
    the impact of the extracts on cell growth clearly provides paths for new lines
    of research into the mechanisms of BR constituents.', The data will lead to studies
    on the interactive effects of the extracts on the chemoprotective nature of berry
    fruits in general and have demonstrated the utility of using this type of approach
    to the study of the bioactivity of natural products., Further advanced NMR analysis
    with unassigned bins may lead to the identification of additional important compounds.,
  'As this study was focused on model development and viewed as a proof of concept,
    recognition by the model of all of the important BR bioactive compounds was limited
    by the use of acidic methanol extracts and the in vitro HT-29 cell proliferation
    assay.', 'However, our overall approach is readily adaptable to modeling the effects
    of a series of extracts including those containing compounds that differ substantially
    in solubility from that of phenols(5) and can be adapted to accommodate other
    continuous Y-variables such as control of tumor development, enzymatic activity,
    or biomarker levels, which would lead to a richer understanding of the complex
    mechanisms by which BR compounds may affect carcinogenesis.', 'Likewise, our approach
    can also be applied to assess the activity of other natural products with complex
    NMR spectra, not only against cancer but also for any complex interaction that
    can be evaluated using a biological assay.', "Table S1, variability in HT-29 colon
