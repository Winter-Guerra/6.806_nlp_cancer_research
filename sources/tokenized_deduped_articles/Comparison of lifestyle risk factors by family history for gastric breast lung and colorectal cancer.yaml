['To assess the theoretical impact of lifestyle of a cancer family history in first-degree
    relatives and clarify interactions between CFH and lifestyle factors, hospital-based
    comparison and case-reference studies were conducted in Nagoya, Japan.', 'Totals
    of 1988 gastric, 2455 breast, 1398 lung and 1352 colorectal cancer patients, as
    well as 50,706 non-cancer outpatients collected from 1988 to 1998, were checked
    for lifestyle factors, which included dietary and physical exercise habits, as
    well as smoking/drinking status.', General lifestyle factors with non-cancer outpatients
    did not differ by the CFH status., 'Case-reference analyses showed that frequent
    intake of fruits, raw vegetables, carrots, pumpkin, cabbage and lettuce, as well
    as frequent physical exercise, were associated with decreased risk for all four
    sites of cancer, while habitual smoking increasing the risk of gastric, and more
    particularly, lung cancer.', 'Interestingly, the study revealed the magnitude
    of odds ratios for the above lifestyle factors obtained from CFH positives to
    be similar to those from CFH negatives for these four sites of cancer.', There
    were no significant interactions between CFH and any particular lifestyle factor.,
  'In conclusion, our results suggest no appreciable influence of CFH on lifestyle
    related risk factors for gastric, breast, lung, and colorectal cancer.', 'Habitual
    smoking increased, while frequent physical exercise and raw vegetables intake
    decreased cancer risk, regardless of the CFH status.']
