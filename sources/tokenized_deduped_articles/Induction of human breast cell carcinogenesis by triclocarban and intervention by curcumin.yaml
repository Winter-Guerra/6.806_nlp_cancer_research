[More than 85% of breast cancers are sporadic and attributable to long-term exposure
    to environmental carcinogens and co-carcinogens., 'To identify co-carcinogens
    with abilities to induce cellular pre-malignancy, we studied the activity of triclocarban,
    an antimicrobial agent commonly used in household and personal care products.',
  'Here, we demonstrated, for the first time, that chronic exposure to TCC at physiologically-achievable
    nanomolar concentrations resulted in progressive carcinogenesis of human breast
    cells from non-cancerous to pre-malignant.', 'Pre-malignant carcinogenesis was
    measured by increasingly-acquired cancer-associated properties of reduced dependence
    on growth factors, anchorage-independent growth and increased cell proliferation,
    without acquisition of cellular tumorigenicity.', Long-term TCC exposure also
    induced constitutive activation of the Erk-Nox pathway and increases of reactive
    oxygen species in cells., 'A single TCC exposure induced transient induction of
    the Erk-Nox pathway, ROS elevation, increased cell proliferation, and DNA damage
    in not only non-cancerous breast cells but also breast cancer cells.', 'Using
    these constitutively- and transiently-induced changes as endpoints, we revealed
    that non-cytotoxic curcumin was effective in intervention of TCC-induced cellular
    pre-malignancy.', Our results lead us to suggest that the co-carcinogenic potential
    of TCC should be seriously considered in epidemiological studies to reveal the
    significance of TCC in the development of sporadic breast cancer., 'Using TCC-induced
    transient and constitutive endpoints as targets will likely help identify non-cytotoxic
    preventive agents, such as curcumin, effective in suppressing TCC-induced cellular
    pre-malignancy.']
