[Many studies with conjugated linoleic acid indicate that it has a protective effect
    against mammary cancer., 'Because dairy products are the most important dietary
    sources of CLA, we have investigated the CLA concentrations and additionally the
    fatty acid profiles and chemical composition of several commercial, traditional,
    Greek yogurts from different geographical origin.', The fat content of yogurts
    was in the order of goat ; cow &lt; sheep., 'Cow, sheep and goat milk yogurts
    contain respectively 0.128-1.501, 0.405-1.250 and 0.433-0.976 g CLA/100 g fat.',
  'Low-fat milk yogurts showed lower values of c-9, t-11 CLA content on lipid basis
    compared to full-fat yogurts.', 'Samples from mountain areas showed average c-9,
    t-11 CLA content higher than those from prairie districts.', 'The highest amounts
    of saturated fatty acids were found in low-fat yogurts, of monounsaturated fatty
    acids in sheep milk yogurts and of polyunsaturated fatty acid in low-fat cow milk
    yogurts.']
