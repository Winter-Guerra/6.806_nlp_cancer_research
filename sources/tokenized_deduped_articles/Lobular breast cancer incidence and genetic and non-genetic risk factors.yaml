['While most invasive breast cancers consist of carcinomas of the ductal type, about
    10% are invasive lobular carcinomas.', Invasive lobular and ductal carcinomas
    differ with respect to risk factors., 'Invasive lobular carcinoma is more strongly
    associated with exposure to female hormones, and therefore its incidence is more
    subject to variation.', 'This is illustrated by US figures during the 1987 to
    2004 period: after 12 years of increases, breast cancer incidence declined steadily
    from 1999 to 2004, reflecting among other causes the decreasing use of menopausal
    hormone therapy, and these variations were stronger for invasive lobular than
    for invasive ductal carcinoma.', 'Similarly, invasive lobular carcinoma is more
    strongly associated with early menarche, late menopause and late age at first
    birth.', 'As for genetic risk factors, four high-penetrance genes are tested in
    clinical practice when genetic susceptibility to breast cancer is suspected, BRCA1,
    BRCA2, TP53 and CDH1.', 'Germline mutations in BRCA1 and TP53 are predominantly
    associated with invasive ductal carcinoma, while BRCA2 mutations are associated
    with both ductal and lobular cancers.', 'CDH1, the gene coding for the E-cadherin
    adhesion protein, is of special interest as mutations are associated with invasive
    lobular carcinoma, but never with ductal carcinoma.', 'It was initially known
    as the main susceptibility gene for gastric cancer of the diffuse type, but the
    excess of breast cancers of the lobular type in CDH1 families led researchers
    to identify it also as a susceptibility gene for invasive lobular carcinoma.',
  'The risk of invasive lobular carcinoma is high in female mutation carriers, as
    about 50% are expected to develop the disease.', 'Carriers must therefore undergo
    intensive breast cancer screening, with, for example, yearly magnetic resonance
    imaging and mammogram starting at age 30 years.', 'Invasive breast cancer is a
    heterogeneous disease of two main histological types, invasive ductal carcinoma
    and invasive lobular carcinoma, IDC being by far the most common.', 'IDC and ILC
    differ with respect to risk factors, and these differences are often overlooked
    as researchers and clinicians tend to treat breast cancer as a single, homogeneous
    entity, or only explore the potential differences between the two types in post
    hoc analyses.', 'In this review, we focus on the specificities of ILC regarding
    incidence and risk factors.', 'We show that ILC is more strongly associated with
    exposure to female hormones than IDC and that, as a result, its incidence in the
    past 25 to 30 years has varied more than that of IDC, depending on environmental
    and lifestyle factors such as menopausal hormone therapy.', 'As for genetic risk
    factors, we show that ILC is often underrepresented in patients carrying mutations
    in the best-known breast cancer susceptibility genes, but that it is the only
    invasive histological type associated with CDH1, the diffuse gastric cancer susceptibility
    gene.', 'ILCs represent about 10% of invasive breast cancer cases ,.', 'Patients
    diagnosed with ILC are, on average, about 3 years older than those with IDC .',
  'Compared with patients with IDC, ILCs are generally diagnosed at a more advanced
    stage, with larger tumor sizes and more frequent lymph node invasion, and are
    more often estrogen receptor- and progesterone receptor-positive .', 'Studies
    conducted in the US indicated a 65% increase in the incidence of ILC between 1987
    and 1999, while IDC rates increased by only 3% during the same period .', 'However,
    after 1999, the age-adjusted incidence rates of both ILC and IDC steadily declined
    ,.', 'More specifically, an average annual decrease of 4.6% for ILC was noted
    between 1999 and 2004 in 44 American states and the District of Columbia, with
    the largest drop in 2003 when an 8.5% decrease was observed.', 'The average annual
    decrease for IDC was smaller, 3.3% for the same five-year period.', "It is likely
    that the decreasing use of MHT contributed to this decline, with an acceleration
    in use reduction from 2002 onwards associated with the publication of the Women\u2019s
    Health Initiative trial results ,.", 'Most breast cancers are related to female
    hormones, and therefore any factor that increases exposure to these hormones is
    a potential risk factor.', 'In particular, reproductive factors associated with
    increased exposure to endogenous estrogens produced by the ovaries, such as earlier
    menarche, late menopause, low parity, and late age at first birth, are recognized
    breast cancer risk factors -.', 'Similarly, women exposed to exogenous hormones
    are often at increased risk ,-.', Lifestyle factors are also associated with breast
    cancer., There is an estimated 10% increase in risk per 10 g of ethanol consumed
    every day ., 'Being overweight or obese is also associated with breast cancer
    risk, but only in postmenopausal women, with a gain of 5 kg/m2 in body mass index
    resulting in an 8% increase in disease risk .', 'On the contrary, excess weight
    is associated with a decrease in risk in premenopausal women.', 'Again, these
    associations can be explained by hormonal factors: alcohol consumption and postmenopausal
    obesity are related to higher circulating estrogen levels .', 'In postmenopause,
    elevated estrogen levels are most probably due to extraglandular production in
    the adipose tissue, whereas in premenopause, the decrease in female hormone synthesis
    associated with anovulatory cycles in obese women likely explains the inverse
    association with breast cancer .', 'ILC being more often hormone receptor-positive
    than IDC, one would expect hormone-related risk factors to be more strongly associated
    with lobular than ductal carcinoma.', 'MHT in the form of combined estrogen plus
    progestin treatment most likely increases the risk of breast cancer, whereas the
    effects of estrogen-only treatments are less clear ,-.', In 2002 the WHI trial
    demonstrated that CHT use increased breast cancer risk ., 'In this prospective,
    randomized primary prevention trial, there was a 26% increase in risk of invasive
    breast cancer in patients taking CHT.', 'A subsequent, detailed analysis of tumor
    characteristics concluded that the percentages and distribution of IDC and ILC
    were similar in the CHT and the placebo group .', 'In the WHI estrogen-alone trial
    that included women with a prior hysterectomy, use of conjugated equine estrogens
    was associated with a 20 to 25% decreased risk of invasive breast cancer compared
    with the placebo group, a reduction in risk that was observed with IDC in subgroup
    analyses, but not with ILC, perhaps because of insufficient statistical power
    ,.', 'This reduction in risk is consistent with preclinical, cellular and animal
    models showing that low-dose estradiol can cause tumor regression and apoptosis
    after prior estrogen deprivation -.', Twenty-five observational studies have evaluated
    the association between MHT and breast cancer risk by histological types -., 'Although
    the heterogeneity between histological subgroups was not always formally tested
    or did not reach statistical significance, a vast majority of these studies showed
    that MHT was more strongly associated with ILC than IDC.', 'As for the type of
    MHT, studies that reported associations separately for CHT and EHT are presented
    in Figure 1.', 'For current CHT use, the relative risk was generally lower than
    2.0 for IDC 1.5 to 1.6) while it exceeded 2.0 for ILC in a majority of studies.',
  RR associated with current EHT use varied between 0.7 and 2.0 for IDC and between
    1.0 and 2.1 for ILC., 'Intriguingly, studies that restricted their analyses to
    estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor tumors still showed a stronger association
    for ILC than for IDC, suggesting that mechanisms independent of the hormone receptors
    account for the increased sensitivity of ILC to MHT ,,-,,.', Figure 1., Relative
    risks of invasive ductal and lobular breast cancer associated with menopausal
    hormone therapy in 22 observational studies., 'CHT, combined hormone therapy;
    CI, confidence interval; EHT, estrogen hormone therapy; RR, relative risk.', Oral
    contraceptives are expected to become less of a risk factor as recent formulations
    contain less hormones than those available decades ago ., 'To our knowledge, there
    are no data indicating that oral contraceptives in general have a differential
    effect on breast cancer depending on the histological subtype.', A recent meta-analysis
    of individual participant data from 85 studies showed a significantly stronger
    association with age at menarche for ILC than for IDC ., 'There was also significant
    heterogeneity between ILC and IDC with respect to the association with age at
    menopause, with a 3.6% increase in risk of ILC per year older at menopause, versus
    2.6% for IDC.', Late age at first birth is associated with an increased risk of
    breast cancer ., 'Among the 19 studies that explored the association between breast
    cancer type and age at first birth ,,,-,-, 14 observed higher risk estimates for
    ILC than for IDC ,,-,,,,-.', 'Associations with other reproductive factors, such
    as parity and breastfeeding, were in general not markedly different between ILC
    and IDC, although a few studies reported stronger associations with parity for
    IDC than for ILC ,,,,.', 'Among eight studies that examined the association between
    alcohol consumption and breast cancer by histological subtype ,,,,-, two observed
    a significant heterogeneity between ILC and IDC ,.', 'RRs were higher for ILC
    than for IDC ,,,,,,.', "Four cohort studies ,,, and five case\u2013control studies
    ,,,, examined the associations between anthropometric measures and risk of breast
    cancer by histogical type.", 'Overall, none observed significant heterogeneity
    between IDC and ILC regarding the association with BMI or height.', 'The two studies
    that examined the association with physical activity did not observe significant
    heterogeneity between IDC and ILC ,.', "Along with environment and lifestyle,
    a woman\u2019s genetic background contributes to her risk of having breast cancer.",
  Her risk of developing breast cancer increases if she has a family history of the
    disease., 'In a re-analysis of 52 studies comparing cancer incidence in relatives
    of breast cancer cases and in controls, RR for breast cancer increased with increasing
    numbers of affected first-degree relatives: compared with women who had no affected
    relative, the RR was 1.80, 2.93, and 3.90, respectively, for women with one, two,
    and three or more affected first-degree relatives .', 'RR was greatest at young
    ages and, for women of a given age, was greater the younger the relative was when
    diagnosed.', Twin studies provide evidence that genes contribute substantially
    to this excess familial risk of breast cancer., 'Combined data on all twin pairs
    listed in three North-European registries showed that concordance for breast cancer
    was two times higher among monozygotic twins, who share all their genes, than
    among dizygotic twins, who share half their genes .', 'About 90 genes or genetic
    loci are involved in breast cancer susceptibility in general, through rare, moderate
    to high penetrance mutations, the penetrance being the risk for a mutation carrier
    of developing a disease, or through common variants associated with risks that
    are only slightly increased compared with the wild-type allele.', 'Mutations and
    variants are germline; that is, they are part of the genetic identity of the individual.',
  'A comprehensive review of genetic susceptibility to breast cancer is beyond the
    scope of this article, as we are focusing here on the specificities of ILC.',
  'Numerous reviews have been written on the issue, and we invite those interested
    to read two recent and extremely well-written articles ,.', 'Four high-penetrance
    genes are tested in clinical practice when genetic susceptibility to breast cancer
    is suspected: BRCA1, BRCA2, TP53 and CDH1.', 'Germline mutations in BRCA1 and
    TP53 are predominantly associated with IDC, BRCA2 mutations are associated with
    both ductal and lobular tumors, while mutations in CDH1 are exclusively associated
    with ILC.', 'Mutations in PTEN and STK11 cause, respectively, Cowden and Peutz-Jaeger
    syndrome, and breast cancer risk is also high in affected females.', 'However,
    the presenting manifestations are usually not related to breast cancer and we
    shall therefore not discuss these two syndromes further ,.', 'In the 1990s, linkage
    analyses and positional cloning in breast and breast-ovarian cancer families led
    to the identification of BRCA1 and BRCA2,.', Both have a role in maintaining DNA
    integrity., Mutations confer a high risk of breast and ovarian cancer with estimated
    breast cancer penetrances of 60% for BRCA1 and 55% for BRCA2 by age 70 years .,
  'However, not all breast and breast-ovarian cancer families carry a mutation in
    BRCA1 or BRCA2.', 'For example, 41% of families with four or five cases of breast
    cancer under the age of 60 years - but no ovarian cancer - are carriers, but that
    proportion increases to 88% in families with at least four breast cancer cases
    and one case of ovarian cancer.', 'Mutations are rare in population-based, unselected
    breast cancer cases.', 'The detection rate was, for example, 2% in a large English
    series of women diagnosed below age 55 years, although it increased to 12% in
    the subset of women diagnosed before age 35 years .', 'These are likely underestimates,
    as the sensitivity of gene analysis techniques was lower in the late 1990s than
    it is today.', Some phenotypic characteristics influence the probability of carrying
    a mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2., 'For example, up to 15% of unselected women with
    triple-negative breast cancer have a BRCA1 mutation, while there does not seem
    to be an association with BRCA2.', 'Similarly, the distribution among different
    breast cancer types varies according to the predisposing gene involved.', 'The
    CIMBA Consortium analyzed the pathology of invasive breast cancers in 6,893 BRCA1/2
    mutation carriers, and found that only 2.2% of tumors associated with BRCA1 were
    ILC.', 'In contrast, the proportion of ILCs in BRCA2 mutation carriers was 8.4%,
    closer to the characteristics of breast cancers from the general population ,.',
  Li-Fraumeni syndrome is characterized by early onset of a variety of tumors., It
    is caused by mutations in the tumour-suppressor gene TP53., 'Affected individuals
    are at increased risk of sarcoma, premenopausal breast cancer, brain cancer, adrenocortical
    cancer, leukaemia, lymphoma, germ cell tumor, melanoma, lung cancer and cancer
    of the digestive tract .', 'Cancer risk by age 45 years is about 41% in males
    and 84% in females; lifetime risk is 73% in males, and approaches 100% in females
    .', 'The majority of cancers in females are breast cancers, and most breast cancers
    are diagnosed before age 45 years.', 'Little is known regarding the histological
    characteristics of breast cancers associated with germline TP53 mutations, but
    the two studies that have examined the issue have only shown tumors of the ductal
    type - and none of the lobular type - out of a total of 48 cancers in mutation
    carriers ,.', 'These data suggest that TP53 might predispose exclusively to IDC,
    and not to ILC.', 'Confirmatory studies are nevertheless needed, and it seems
    premature at this stage to exclude ILC from the tumor spectrum associated with
    Li-Fraumeni syndrome.', 'ILCs are therefore very much underrepresented in carriers
    of BRCA1 and TP53 mutations, while their frequency in BRCA2 mutation carriers
    is more similar to that in the general population.', 'This overall underrepresentation
    of lobular cancers contrasts with observations made in over 40,000 Utah cases
    with genealogical records showing unusually high levels of familial clustering
    for ILC, and therefore a higher contribution of genetic, inherited factors compared
    with IDC .', 'The CDH1 susceptibility gene likely explains at least some of this
    excess in familial risk, the remainder being accounted for by genes and loci that
    are yet to be discovered.', CDH1 is located on chromosome 16q22 and codes for
    the E-cadherin protein., E-cadherin maintains tissue integrity as it mediates
    cell-cell adhesion., 'There is also evidence that forced expression of the protein
    inhibits the growth of breast cancer cells via mechanisms that are yet to be determined,
    and that the protein therefore controls cell proliferation in addition to its
    anti-invasion properties ,.', Its tumor-suppression role is limited to breast
    cancer of the lobular type., 'Indeed, loss of expression is observed in the majority
    of lobular breast carcinomas, and, in the few tumors with conserved expression,
    E-cadherin integrity is impaired .', 'On the contrary, expression is unaffected
    in ductal breast carcinomas .', 'First-event somatic mutations, with subsequent
    loss of heterozygosity or promoter methylation, are classically responsible for
    CDH1 inactivation following the two-hit loss-of-function model .', 'Therefore,
    an individual with an inherited, germline mutation in CDH1 is at increased risk
    of ILC as a single somatic event is sufficient to generate tumorigenesis.', 'Readers
    should be reminded here that CDH1 was initially known as a susceptibility gene
    for gastric cancer of the diffuse type, following the identification of germline
    mutations in Caucasian, Maori and African-American families with multiple affected
    individuals -.', 'Like in ILC, E-cadherin inactivation is an early event in diffuse
    gastric cancer development and, as expected in this context, the histopathological
    characteristics of diffuse gastric cancer show similarities with ILC, with neoplastic
    cells permeating the mucosa and wall as scattered individual signet-ring cells
    or small clusters in an infiltrative growth pattern ,,.', 'In a collaborative
    study based on 11 CDH1 families, the International Gastric Cancer Linkage Consortium
    showed that the clinical penetrance for diffuse gastric cancer was high, as the
    estimated risk for carriers of developing the disease was 67 to 83% .', 'Interestingly,
    that same study observed that, in addition to diffuse gastric cancer, female carriers
    were also at high risk of ILC .', 'Indeed, there were seven cases of breast cancers
    in these 11 CDH1 families, some of them at an early age, and histology, when documented,
    was systematically of the lobular type.', The estimated risk for ILC was 39% by
    age 80 years., 'Subsequent studies of families with CDH1 mutations led to similar
    conclusions: in four families with a total of 22 breast cancers, all invasive
    tumors for which a pathological report was available were lobular ,.', 'As for
    penetrance, a recent estimate derived from 67 mutation-positive families is 56%.',
  'There is increasing evidence that a personal history of early-onset bilateral ILC
    or family history of multiple ILC at a young age, in the absence of diffuse gastric
    cancer in the family, can be associated with CDH1 germline mutations.', 'Masciari
    and colleagues  described the case of a woman carrier with unilateral ILC at age
    42 years, and whose mother had been diagnosed with the same condition at age 28
    years.', We reported three female cases who presented with bilateral ILC below
    age 50 years and turned out to carry mutations in CDH1., 'In the only systematic
    study of women with bilateral lobular breast neoplasia before age 60 years, Petridis
    and colleagues  found mutations in 4 out of 50 women.', 'Schrader and colleagues  had
    previously looked into the issue with discrepant findings, as they only found
    mutations or potentially causal variants in 4 out of 318 women with ILC either
    before age 45 years or regardless of age if there was a family history of breast
    cancer.', 'However, it was not known how many women actually had a family history
    of breast cancer of the lobular type, as histology in relatives was not specified.',
  'Furthermore, there was no upper age limit for women with familial ILC, and BRCA1/2
    mutations had not been excluded in all cases.', 'Cancer geneticists should therefore
    consider prescribing CDH1 germline analysis in patients with a personal or family
    history of multiple pathologically proven early-onset ILC, but no diffuse gastric
    cancer, as the identification of a mutation would have direct and dramatic clinical
    implications.', 'The patient would be offered risk-reducing gastrectomy, given
    the high risk of diffuse gastric cancer ,.', 'Her adult relatives would then undergo
    targeted genetic analysis to see if they carry the mutation, and those who do
    would also be offered risk-reducing gastrectomy.', 'Surveillance with upper endoscopy
    is a poor alternative to prophylactic surgery, except in very specific situations,
    as this screening modality frequently misses foci of diffuse carcinoma in mutation
    carriers even when accompanied by multiple random biopsies ,.', 'Large, multicenter
    studies on the prevalence of CDH1 mutations in patients and families with multiple
    cases of ILC are needed.', 'The high risk of ILC in females carrying a CDH1 mutation
    justifies personalized, intensive surveillance.', 'The consensus 2010 CDH1 paper
    recommended that breast cancer surveillance be carried out within specific research
    protocols, and suggested annual magnetic resonance imaging and mammogram starting
    at age 35 years .', 'As ILC risk is close to the overall breast cancer risk seen
    in carriers of BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations, it seems reasonable to offer the same type
    of surveillance as a routine procedure, and start screening at age 30 years with
    annual MRI and mammogram ,.', Risk-reducing mastectomy could be an alternative.,
  Updated international recommendations on the management of CDH1 mutation carriers
    that will address the issue are expected soon., 'Over 80 other breast cancer susceptibility
    genes and loci have been identified in the past few years, but again none have
    entered clinical practice either because of the difficulty in interpreting results
    from sequencing analyses or because the RR associated with the mutated alleles
    is so low that there is at best limited clinical relevance ,.', "Only one low-penetrance
    variant was specifically associated with ILC in a pooled, post hoc analysis of
    36 case\u2013control studies .", 'We have reviewed in this article the specificities
    of ILC regarding disease incidence and environmental, lifestyle and genetic risk
    factors, and have shown that there were notable differences with IDC.', 'ILC is
    more strongly related to endogenous and exogenous female hormones and its incidence,
    therefore, is more subject to variation, depending, for example, on key reproductive
    factors such as age at menarche or at first pregnancy, or on MHT use.', 'Genetic
    risk factors vary depending on breast cancer histology, and CDH1 proves that genes
    involved in susceptibility to ILC do not have to be involved in IDC susceptibility.',
  The type-specific hypothesis is hardly ever explored in breast cancer epidemiology.,
  'It is essential, therefore, that, in the near future, studies start turning their
    attention specifically to ILC instead of relying on post hoc exploratory analyses,
    or on data extracted from families with mutations predisposing primarily to other
    cancers.', More epidemiological studies are still needed to establish whether
    associations with other known or still unidentified risk factors differ depending
    on the histological type., 'As for genetic studies, large-scale projects focusing
    on women with unexplained early-onset or familial ILC are urgently needed, as
    there are certainly many more clinically relevant susceptibility genes to discover.',
  'The identification of specific risk factors would help define high-risk groups
    that could benefit from adapted, personalized screening strategies.', 'This article
    is part of a series on Lobular breast cancer, edited by Ulrich Lehmann.', 'Other
