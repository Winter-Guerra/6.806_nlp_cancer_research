['Previous studies on a murine model have demonstrated that the administration of
    Lactobacillus helveticus and Lactobacillus casei inhibits the development of fibrosarcoma
    and colon carcinoma, respectively.', The aim of this work was to study the beneficial
    effects of the consumption of milk fermented by L. helveticus on a murine model
    for mammary carcinoma., Female BALB/c mice were challenged by a single subcutaneous
    injection of tumoral cells in the left mammary gland., 'Prior to tumour injection,
    mice were fed for two, five or seven consecutive days with fermented milk.', "The
    following factors were monitored for 2 months: rate of tumour development, histological
    studies, apoptosis, phagocytic index, peritoneal macrophages, determination of
    \u03B2-glucuronidase enzyme in peritoneal macrophages, determination of \u03B3-interferon
    and tumour necrosis factor-\u03B1 in blood serum, determination of CD4+, CD8+,
    interleukin-6, IL-10, TNF-\u03B1 and INF\u03B3 by immunoperoxidase, and measurement
    of \u03B2-glucuronidase activity in intestinal fluid.", 'The administration of
    L. helveticus delayed the development of the tumour in all cases, a 2- or 7-day
    feeding period being most effective.', This work demonstrates that milk fermented
    with L. helveticus decreases the growth rate of mammary tumours., 'The effect
    was mediated by increased apoptosis and decreased production of pro-inflammatory
    cytokines, in particular IL-6, implicated in oestrogen synthesis.']
