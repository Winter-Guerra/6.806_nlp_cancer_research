[Essential oils from various aromatic plants have been reported to exert chemopreventive
    and/or antitumor effects., 'In addition, a number of studies have shown the ability
    of chemopreventive phytochemicals to increase the sensitivity of cancer cells
    to conventional anticancer drugs.', 'The success of chemotherapeutic agents is
    often hindered by the development of drug resistance, with multidrug resistant
    phenotypes reported in a number of tumors, generally involving reduced intracellular
    drug accumulation due to increased drug efflux by membrane transporters.', 'In
    the present study, the effects of linalool, a monoterpene alcohol found in the
    essential oils from many aromatic plants, on the growth of two human breast adenocarcinoma
    cell lines, MCF7 WT and multidrug resistant MCF7 AdrR, were investigated, both
    as a single agent and in combination with doxorubicin.', 'The results reported
    here show that LIN only moderately inhibits cell proliferation; interestingly,
    however, subtoxic concentrations of LIN potentiate DOX-induced cytotoxicity and
    pro-apoptotic effects in both cell lines.', 'A significant synergism can be observed
    in MCF7 AdrR cells, which may be due, at least in part, to the ability of LIN
    to increase DOX accumulation and to induce a decrease in Bcl-xL levels.', 'In
    summary, the results of the present study suggest that LIN may improve the therapeutic
    index of anthracyclines in the management of breast cancer, especially in MDR
    tumors.']
