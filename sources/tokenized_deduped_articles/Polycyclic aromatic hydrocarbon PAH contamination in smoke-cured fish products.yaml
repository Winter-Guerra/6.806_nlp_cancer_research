['In this study, 108 fish samples of smoke cured fish Sardinella aurita collected
    from 12 major fishing communities along the coastal belt of Ghana were extracted
    with Soxhlet apparatus using dichloromethane, and analyzed for sixteen polycyclic
    aromatic hydrocarbons using the GC/MS to determine levels, distribution and the
    characterization of their sources.', "The mean total PAHs in the smoked sardines
    from the various communities ranged from 510.59 \xCE\xBCg/kg to 1461.79 \xCE\xBCg/kg
    for all seasons with a mean value of 716.84 \xCE\xBCg/kg.", "The benzopyrene had
    a maximum mean level of 73.78 \xCE\xBCg/kg.", "The unit risk of carcinogenic PAHs
    for benzopyrene, chrysene, dibenzanthracene, benzoanthracene, benzofluoranthene,
    benzofluoranthene, and indenolpyrene associated with oral ingestion of smoked
    sardine was calculated to be 6.1 \xD7 10\u22127 for adults and 1.6 \xD7 10\u22127
    for children.", There is a significant correlation between the fish lipid content
    and the total PAH levels., The average lipid content of the smoked sardine samples
    collected varied among the various fishing seasons in Ghana., 'A significantly
    high accumulation of PAHs was found in the smoke-cured fish as compared to the
    non-smoke-cured fish control samples, which showed PAH levels that were below
    detection.', This study highlights the increased danger of consuming smoke-cured
    fish in Ghana as some of the PAHs are known to be carcinogenic., These results
    indicate that there is a need to find alternative ways of curing fish other than
    the traditional smoking process.]
