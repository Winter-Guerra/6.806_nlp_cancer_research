[Trace amounts of acrylamide are present in many foods cooked at high temperatures.,
  Acrylamide in processed potato products is formed from reducing sugars and asparagine
    and is a product of the Maillard reaction; this reaction typically occurs during
    frying and baking of food products., 'Processed potato products, including fries
    and chips, are relatively high in acrylamide compared with other foods and contribute
    substantially to dietary acrylamide.', 'Acrylamide content in potato products
    is strongly affected by processing conditions, potato variety, field management,
    environmental conditions during tuber growth, and tuber storage conditions.',
  'Numerous approaches have been described that could potentially reduce the acrylamide
    content of potato products, but many influence finished product sensory attributes
    and may be difficult to implement.', Health concerns related to acrylamide in
    food center on its role as a potential carcinogen., Research using feeding studies
    with rodent models and epidemiological studies with humans are ongoing and are
    likely to provide future guidance for acceptable amounts of acrylamide in food.,

  'Since acrylamide had been identified previously as a neurotoxin and likely carcinogen,
    this finding raised health concerns that prompted researchers worldwide to investigate
    the formation, prevalence and safety of acrylamide in food.', This review begins
    with a brief history of acrylamide and its discovery in food., 'This is followed
    by a description of the chemical reactions that produce acrylamide during cooking,
    and how the final amount of acrylamide formed is influenced by the chemical composition
    of raw potato tubers and by processing methods.', Relationships between final
    acrylamide content and raw product composition or finished product color are discussed.,
  'Options for reducing the acrylamide content of processed potato products are discussed
    next, with an emphasis on the use of potato varieties with low acrylamide-forming
    potential, careful management of the crop, and appropriate processing and quality
    control methods.', The final section summarizes key findings on dietary exposure
    to acrylamide and the risk that acrylamide in food poses to human health., Acrylamide
    is a small organic compound with high water solubility and moderate reactivity
    with other organic molecules through binding at either the nitrogen or oxygen
    atom., 'Acrylamide has been used in industry and research since the 1950s, usually
    in the form of highly hydrated gels produced by linking single acrylamide monomers
    into linear or branched polymers.', Human health hazards associated with the handling
    and breathing of acrylamide monomers were first identified in the 1960s., 'Chronic
    exposure to high amounts of acrylamide monomer was shown to result in neurotoxicity
    that left individuals with muscle weakness, sensory loss and absent reflexes.',
  The possibility that acrylamide might be a carcinogen was raised in the 1970s and
    1980s when studies showed that exposure could cause chromosome aberrations in
    bone marrow and germ line cells of mice and tumors in rats exposed to acrylamide
    through contact or ingestion., 'Acrylamide was also shown to undergo chemical
    modification in mammalian tissues to form glycidamide, a mutagen and carcinogen
    more potent than acrylamide itself.', Proposed chemical reactions leading to the
    formation of acrylamide during cooking., "A general series of reactions that begins
    with reducing sugars and any \u03B1-amino acid is found at the top of the figure.",
  A reaction sequence beginning with reducing sugars and asparagine as the amino acid
    is illustrated on the bottom of the figure., Figure reproduced with permission

    The possibility that humans might be exposed widely to acrylamide was raised in
    the 1990s.', 'At that time, N-(2-carbamoylethyl)valine, an adduct of the red blood
    cell protein hemoglobin and acrylamide, was being use used as a biomarker to monitor
    occupational exposure to acrylamide.', 'Unexpectedly, the acrylamide-derived adduct
    was found in individuals with no known exposure to acrylamide in the workplace.',
  This indicated that additional sources of acrylamide existed in the environment.,
  'Early suggestions that acrylamide might be found in cooked foods were confirmed
    in 2002, when it was discovered that many foods, especially those rich in carbohydrates
    and cooked at high temperatures, had low but detectable amounts of acrylamide.',
  'Potato products, including french fries, potato chips, and others processed at
    high temperature were found to contain high concentrations of acrylamide relative
    to other foods.', 'Other products with relatively high amounts of acrylamide included
    crackers, cookies, bread and coffee.', 'Concerns were raised worldwide because
    of the unknown potential for health problems to develop following long-term dietary
    exposure to low amounts of acrylamide, and because of the data linking acrylamide
    and glycidamide to cancer.', "At the time when it was discovered in food, acrylamide
    was classified as \u201Cprobably carcinogenic to humans\u201D by the International
    Agency for Research on Cancer and a Category 2 carcinogen by the European Union.",
  Responses to the discovery of acrylamide in food were rapid and occurred on several
    fronts., Food chemists investigated the mechanism of acrylamide formation during
    cooking., Food companies and food scientists began identifying changes in processing
    methods that could reduce acrylamide content in finished products., Regulatory
    agencies collected data on acrylamide exposure in order to determine if regulations
    specifically governing acrylamide content in foods were needed., 'Epidemiologists
    and laboratory researchers began studies designed to determine if consumption
    of low amounts of acrylamide, such as those found in food, is a hazard to human
    health.', 'The activities of these interconnected groups, what they have found,
    and what remains to be learned are the topic of this review.', Additional reviews
    are recommended for those seeking additional detail or alternative perspectives.,
  Acrylamide is not present in raw potato tubers and is not present in boiled or steamed
    potatoes., 'Acrylamide is formed at high temperatures such as those used for frying,
    baking, roasting and in some cases microwave cooking.', There is general agreement
    that acrylamide formation begins as a by-product of the Maillard reaction., The
    Maillard reaction is better known in the potato industry for the melanoidin pigments
    it produces that give rise to unacceptably dark-colored chips and fries., 'The
    acrylamide found in potato products is formed almost exclusively from asparagine,
    glucose and fructose, although several other compounds have the ability to react
    with reducing sugars to produce acrylamide.', 'The chemical steps leading to acrylamide
    formation are not fully understood, but mechanisms of synthesis have been proposed.',
  Parker et al., proposed a framework for acrylamide formation that contains two pathways
    of acrylamide synthesis., 'In the generic amino acid pathway, a reducing sugar
    reacts with any amino acid to generate a Schiff base.', 'This rearranges to form
    an Amadori compound and these compounds dehydrate and fragment, releasing the
    amino acid and producing a suite of highly reactive intermediates including deoxyosuloses,
    dicarbonyls and hydroxycarbonlys.', These intermediates react with amino acids
    to produce the Maillard-reaction compounds that add flavor and color to fried
    or cooked potato products., 'However, when the intermediates react with asparagine
    they initiate a series of reactions that produce acrylamide.', An implicit feature
    of the generic amino acid pathway is that acrylamide formation increases relative
    to color formation as the molar ratio of asparagine to total amino acids increases.,
  'Alternatively, acrylamide can be formed directly from reducing sugars and asparagine
    in a reaction sequence that also begins with the formation of a Schiff base.',
  Acrylamide is likely to be formed from both pathways in complex systems such as
    food., 'Asparagine is usually the most abundant free amino acid in potato tubers,
    and the high concentration of free asparagine in potatoes relative to other starchy
    foods is one of the reasons that processed potato products are relatively high
    in acrylamide.', 'Differences in asparagine content between cultivars have been
    measured, but for most varieties the range of asparagine contents is fairly narrow.',
  "Asparagine content is typically between 4 and 25 mg g\u22121 dry weight.", "In
    this regard, asparagine is unlike the reducing sugars glucose and fructose that
    routinely range more widely, from less than 0.04 to 4.8 mg g\u22121 dry weight
    in tubers grown and stored commercially for processing.", 'Tuber contents of asparagine
    are often far in excess of those for reducing sugars, and when this is the case
    asparagine is unlikely to be limiting for acrylamide formation.', 'For example,
    in a comparison between fry processing varieties and chip processing varieties,
    a weak correlation was found between tuber asparagine content and acrylamide-forming
    potential in the fry processing varieties, but not for the chipping varieties.',
  'In part, this might be due to larger reducing sugar content in the processing potatoes,
    which averaged 2.4 times that in the chip processing varieties.', These data support
    the idea that asparagine content is a stronger determinant of acrylamide formation
    as reducing sugar content increases., Lines with low tuber asparagine contents
    have been created using molecular techniques., These lines produced products with
    less acrylamide than lines with higher asparagine across a narrow range of reducing
    sugar concentrations., 'There is a strong, direct relationship between the reducing
    sugar content in raw tubers and the amount of acrylamide produced during cooking.',
  The data presented in Fig., 2 for french fries are representative of several early
    studies that illustrate this point., "Potatoes with reducing sugar concentrations
    ranging from 0 to 2.6 % of dry matter had acrylamide content in finished fries
    that ranged from 0 to over 2,500 \u03BCg kg\u22121.", "The correlation between
    acrylamide formed and tuber reducing sugar content was quite high, although tubers
    used for fry processing rarely have reducing sugar contents above 10 to 15 mg
    g\u22121 dry weight.", 'For any given amount of tuber reducing sugar, however,
    a wide range of acrylamide values was observed.', 'Thus, reducing sugar content
    alone gives a very imprecise indication of finished product acrylamide content.',
  'Tuber fructose or glucose, total reducing sugars, and asparagine in the ranges
    commonly measured in commercial potatoes do not predict acrylamide precisely enough
    for potential management of processed products.', Relationship between tuber reducing
    sugar content and acrylamide content in french fries., Note that acrylamide content
    increased linearly with increasing reducing sugar content., 'Figure reproduced
    with permission from American Chemical Society




    It is likely that tuber constituents other than reducing sugars and asparagine
    participate in an additive or subtractive fashion to determine final acrylamide
    content.', Antioxidants are one group of compounds that may play a role in modulating
    the amount of acrylamide produced., A strong correlation was found between total
    antioxidant capacity and acrylamide content of potato chips., 'In experiments
    comparing acrylamide formed in heated, freeze-dried potato powder from several
    varieties of potato tubers, high amounts of phenolic compounds were related to
    lower levels of acrylamide.', 'Other data indicate that antioxidants may have
    no effect on acrylamide formation, or increase its production.', 'For example,
    none of six phenolic antioxidants including ferulic acid, catechin or epicatechin
    reduced the amount of acrylamide formed in a model system with equal concentrations
    of glucose and asparagine.', 'In a similar model system, proanthocyanadin-enriched
    fruit extracts inhibited acrylamide formation.', These conflicting observations
    may be attributed to differences in the chemical properties of specific antioxidants.,
  'Antioxidants in potato tubers fall into several distinct structural categories,
    including carotenoids, phenolics including chlorogenic acid, flavonoids such as
    catechin and epicatechin, and anthocyanins.', An important area of research is
    to characterize specific antioxidants in terms of their potential to inhibit or
    promote acrylamide formation., 'Potato cultivars high in phenolics and other antioxidants
    are being developed by several US potato-breeding programs, and these efforts
    may have a secondary effect on the acrylamide content of processed products.',
  'All potato tubers contain reducing sugars and asparagine, but acrylamide formation
    from these requires specific conditions.', "Among these are temperatures above
    ~120 \xB0C and low tissue water content.", These conditions are perfectly met
    during the later stages of chip and fry production., The influence of temperature
    on acrylamide formation is illustrated in Fig., '3.', 'In this case, fried chips
    were made from replicate tuber samples from the cultivar Tivoli that were cooked
    at three oil temperatures.', Slices were either fried immediately or blanched
    in distilled water for 40 or 90 min to reduce the amount of acrylamide precursors
    prior to frying., 'In all cases, chips were cooked to final water content of 1.7
    %.', "Final acrylamide content in chips that were not blanched and cooked at 190
    \xB0C was almost three times that in chips cooked at 170 \xB0C.", 'This finding,
    that higher temperatures lead to disproportionately higher amounts of acrylamide
    in finished products, has been demonstrated many times using model systems and
    fresh potato slices and fries.', 'Acrylamide content of potato chips increased
    as cooking temperature increased, and decreased with longer times of soaking in
    water prior to frying.', Reprinted with permission from Pedreschi et al., '2004


    Water content during cooking has a pronounced influence on acrylamide formation.',
  'As water content drops below ~10 % moisture, the rate of acrylamide production
    increases and acrylamide accumulation reaches a maximum at ;5 % water.', The data
    presented in Fig., 4a illustrate how the final acrylamide content in potato chips
    varies with cooking time and water content., 'In these data, little acrylamide
    was formed during the first 2.0 min of cooking, when chip temperature increased
    and water content was still high.', Rapid acrylamide formation occurred during
    the next minute., For the data plotted in Fig., '4, two thirds of the acrylamide
    formed was produced between 2 and 3 min of cooking.', Additional cooking at high
    temperatures leads to a net loss of acrylamide through thermal breakdown., Over-cooking
    markedly degrades the taste and texture of the finished product and this makes
    thermal breakdown an unsuitable method for acrylamide reduction., The degradation
    of acrylamide that occurs during over-cooking is apparent in Fig., 4a at cooking
    times greater than 5 min., Kinetics of acrylamide formation and water content
    in relation to frying time and average temperature changes in the cooking oil
    and outer cell layer of the chip during the cooking process., 'Figures reproduced

    After the discovery of acrylamide in food, many disparate groups concluded that
    they needed to quantify the amount of acrylamide in potato products.', Regulatory
    agencies began multiyear monitoring efforts to assess consumer exposure to acrylamide
    and trends in acrylamide content of processed potato products., Processing companies
    needed to assess acrylamide content as part of emerging quality control strategies.,
  'Potato breeding programs needed to assess the acrylamide-forming potential of advance
    lines, with an eye toward releasing improved germplasm.', 'Unfortunately, accurate
    quantification of acrylamide in potato products requires technical expertise and
    sophisticated laboratory equipment.', 'As a result, acrylamide analysis is expensive.',
  The cost per sample can be up to $100 to 150 in a commercial laboratory., 'Furthermore,
    the strong influence of processing technique on acrylamide content of finished
    potato products creates methodological challenges.', 'Variation in starting material,
    preparation techniques, sample dimensions, cooking temperature and duration, moisture
    content of finished product, and numerous other steps can contribute to variability
    in the data and lead to misinterpretation of results.', 'As a consequence, sophisticated,
    highly controlled approaches for sample preparation must be utilized to generate
    accurate experimental results.', The high cost of analysis and sample preparation
    means that few organizations can afford to routinely process a large number of
    samples., 'This is especially true for potato breeding programs, where direct
    analysis of acrylamide may be affordable for the most advance clones, but not
    for early generation material.', These limitations have encouraged several researchers
    to develop models for acrylamide content in finished product based on finished
    product color or composition of raw product., Acrylamide formation and fried product
    color both depend primarily on reducing sugar content of raw products., Several
    groups have investigated the feasibility of using finished product color as an
    indirect measure of acrylamide content., These efforts were partially successful.,
  'Acrylamide content correlates well with product lightness, measured as the luminosity
    component of color across a wide color range.', 'The chromatic color component,
    which is a measure of redness, may correlate better with acrylamide content for
    both chips and fries.', "The variation in L and a at acrylamide values of less
    than 1,000 \u03BCg kg\u22121 may preclude effective use of this approach to predict
    acrylamide content for most processed potato products.", 'Thus, although there
    is a general agreement between chip or fry color and acrylamide content, color
    parameters may not be suitable surrogates for acrylamide measurement because a
    wide range of acrylamide contents are observed in chips and fries with the same
    color values.', Close relationships between product color and acrylamide content
    were observed only if samples with the same water content were compared., 'It
    is important to note that at low water contents, acrylamide-forming reactions
    are more temperature-sensitive than browning reactions.', Hence at higher temperatures
    there is a disproportionate increase in the amount of acrylamide produced relative
    to amount of browning that occurs., 'Thus, relationships between color and acrylamide
    content are likely to be most precise when they are determined for each cooking
    temperature used.', Acrylamide content in fried potato strips cooked at 3 temperatures
    was correlated with the color parameters L and a., Lower values of the lighness
    parameter L and higher values of the redness parameter a correspond to darker
    colored fried strips., 'Figure reprinted from with permission


    Several acrylamide-prediction models have been developed that focus on the kinetics
    of acrylamide formation using estimated rates for the underlying chemical reactions.',
  'Models similar to these are useful for testing and optimizing processing operations
    and understanding the consequences of variation in tuber composition on acrylamide
    formation, but models must be validated for the range of conditions being examined.',
  'Less sophisticated models have been used in attempts to establish correlations
    between acrylamide in chips or fries and tuber composition, including reducing
    sugars, asparagine, other sugars and amino acids, dry matter content and protein
    content.', 'These models do not capture the chemistry of acrylamide formation,
    but rather rely on statistical relationships found in the samples used to develop
    the model.', Caution is advised when the tubers used for processing are not representative
    of those used to develop the model., 'Variety, growing location, cultural management
    practices, and storage conditions all influence tuber asparagine and reducing
    sugar composition and affect acrylamide-forming potential.', 'Because changes
    in acrylamide content are never explained completely by documented changes in
    tuber composition, it can be inferred that important yet poorly characterized
    variation in tuber properties contributes to acrylamide formation.', 'Until these
    parameters are better defined, models for acrylamide formation need to be validated
    for individual varieties grown in a particular environment under a limited set
    of management practices if they are to have high utility.', 'The methods used
    to measure acrylamide have received considerable attention as research groups
    have sought to develop faster, more accurate, cheaper or simpler approaches.',
  'Acrylamide analysis typically involves aqueous extraction of acrylamide from frozen
    or fresh samples, concentration or sample cleanup using solid phase extraction,
    and analysis by gas chromatography and mass spectrophotometry or high performance
    liquid chromatography.', 'The total time required for analysis is often several
    days, and this means that product quality assessments based on acrylamide content
    are not available until days after tubers have been processed into chips, fries
    or other products.', Most improvements to analytical methodologies have been in
    the ease of sample preparation and the speed of the analysis., 'None of the methods
    developed removes the requirements for highly skilled technical staff and sophisticated,
    expensive equipment.', 'Indeed, in some cases more expensive or complicated equipment
    has been required.', 'For near-real time sampling, such as might be employed on
    a process line to make quality control determinations, near infrared spectroscopy
    shows some promise.', NIR is used to measure non-destructively the composition
    of many food products and NIR has been used to measure water content and fat content
    in potato chips., Methods to use NIR to measure acrylamide in potato chips have
    been investigated., 'For chips made from cultivar Saturna, the correlation between
    acrylamide measured using GC-MS/MS and NIR was high with R2 equal to 0.83 over
    a wide range of acrylamide contents.', "However, a relatively large, average prediction
    error of 266 \u03BCg kg\u22121 dry weight was observed.", "An earlier study had
    a similar level of accuracy, and these data suggest that improvements in methodology
    are needed before this approach can be used to accurately measure acrylamide in
    the range of 500 \u03BCg kg\u22121 or less.", Reducing the acrylamide content
    in processed potato products has become a goal of the potato industry in the US
    and elsewhere., "As noted in a review on this topic, acrylamide reduction requires
    a comprehensive \u201Cfarm to fork\u201D approach.", 'Consistently, reducing acrylamide
    in finished products is likely to depend on tailoring variety selection, field
    and storage management, processing methods and overall quality control to achieve
    this goal.', Changes to any one of these components are not likely to consistently
    reduce acrylamide content if other components leading to finished product formation
    are not improved or maintained consistently within narrow limits., "The \u201Cacrylamide
    toolbox\u201D and reviews by Seal et al.", and Vinci and Mestdagh are recommended
    for those seeking additional information on this topic., 'As described above,
    the amount of acrylamide in processed potato products depends on the amounts of
    tuber fructose, glucose and asparagine, and on the presence of other compounds
    that accelerate or decelerate the rate or extent of acrylamide-forming reactions.',
  'Tuber composition depends on both genotypic and environmental effects, with both
    contributing substantially to the final acrylamide content of processed potato
    products.', Potato cultivars have been bred for low reducing sugars for over half
    a century., 'Although highly beneficial in terms of acrylamide mitigation, these
    breeding efforts have been focused primarily on producing light-colored, flavorful
    processed products from freshly harvested and stored tubers.', Selection for low
    reducing sugar content has been more successful for chip rather than fry processing
    potatoes., "Chipping potatoes will often have a reducing sugar content of 0.075
    mg g\u22121 fresh weight or less, whereas fry processing varieties typically have
    reducing sugar contents of greater than 1 mg g\u22121 fresh weight, especially
    for tubers out of storage.", 'Because of this difference, it may be easier to
    decrease the acrylamide-forming potential of fry processing varieties relative
    to chip processing varieties through breeding for lower amounts of reducing sugars.',
  'Potato tubers have never been bred for low asparagine, and until recently the range
    of asparagine in tubers from different cultivars and wild tuber bearing Solanum
    species was not known.', Several recent germplasm surveys have established a substantial
    range in asparagine content between cultivated potato varieties and wild species
    relatives., "Tuber asparagine content in most cultivated potato ranged from 4
    to 25 mg g\u22121 dry weight, although data for some varieties are notable for
    being outside of this range.", "In one report both Agata and Arinda had very low
    amounts of tuber asparagine at 156 and 504 mg kg\u22121 fresh weight, respectively.",
  "Conversely, asparagine contents of over 30 mg g\u22121 dry weight have been reported
    in potatoes from China, Japan and Italy.", In S. tuberosum ssp., "andigenum, the
    range of observed tuber asparagine contents was 1.2 to 76.3 mg g\u22121 dry weight
    and the range of tuber asparagine content in several wild species relatives of
    potato was at least that large.", 'These data suggest that variation in tuber
    asparagine content is readily available in S. tuberosum and close relatives of
    cultivated potato, and that individual genotypes with low asparagine contents
    can be used in breeding efforts aimed at reducing tuber asparagine content.',
  A further indication that breeding for low asparagine content potato tubers is possible
    comes from an evaluation of clones in a full sib breeding population., "Parents
    had mean tuber asparagine contents of 7.87 and 10.3 mmol kg\u22121 dry weight.",
  'Tuber asparagine content segregated among the progeny with tuber asparagine content
    in 11 of 43 progeny falling between the two parents, and seven progeny having
    tuber asparagine less than the lower parent.', 'Acrylamide-forming potential,
    either quantified indirectly by tuber reducing sugar, asparagine and perhaps antioxidant
    contents or by direct measurement of acrylamide in finished products, is likely
    to become a standard criterion for evaluating new potato varieties given the importance
    that the potato industry worldwide has placed on acrylamide mitigation.', Selection
    based on phenotypic expression or molecular markers linked to key traits can be
    used to develop next-generation genotypes that have lessened acrylamide-forming
    potential compared with current varieties., Targeted genetic modification is an
    alternative to conventional potato breeding that also has the potential to reduce
    the acrylamide content of finished products., A significant advantage of this
    approach is that it can be used to improve an existing cultivar without altering
    substantially the agronomic traits of the original variety., Both tuber reducing
    sugar content and asparagine content have been decreased in popular cultivars
    using molecular approaches., "Asparagine content was reduced in Ranger Russet
    and in Atlantic using RNA-interference to \u201Cturn off\u201D, or silence genes
    for asparagine synthetase.", These genes encode the proteins that are primarily
    responsible for asparagine synthesis in potato., 'Transformed lines varied in
    the efficiency of gene silencing, but some individual lines had an 80 % reduction
    in gene expression and a corresponding decrease of up to 95 % in tuber asparagine
    content.', 'When acrylamide content of fries made from Ranger Russet was quantified,
    reductions of up to 95 % were observed in transformed lines.', 'For Atlantic,
    decreasing asparagine content by 80 % resulted in a 90 % reduction in chip acrylamide.',
  Double-silencing lines that targeted both asparagine synthetase genes in Ranger
    Russet had tuber and vine defects under field conditions., 'Silencing only the
    StAst1 gene, however, was sufficient to substantially lower asparagine in tubers.',
  'In this case, tuber yield and quality were comparable to that of non-transformed
    Ranger Russet.', These data demonstrate clearly that low tuber asparagine contents
    can limit acrylamide formation even when the starting material is a processing
    potato variety with moderately low reducing sugar contents., Several molecular
    approaches have been used to decrease tuber reducing sugar contents., 'In one
    case, this was achieved by silencing the R1 gene for starch phosphorylase.', Starch
    phosphorylase is an important enzyme in the breakdown of stored starch., Reducing
    expression of R1 resulted in clear reductions in tuber reducing sugar content
    in storage that corresponded with reduced acrylamide content of fries made from
    transformed lines of Ranger Russet., 'An alternative molecular target is vacuolar
    acid invertase, which functions at the other end of the molecular pathway linking
    starch breakdown to reducing sugar accumulation.', Vacuolar acid invertase hydrolyzes
    one molecule of sucrose into one molecule of glucose and one of fructose., This
    reaction takes place in subcellular organelles called vacuoles., The expression
    of the gene for vacuolar acid invertase has been decreased using RNA interference
    or antisense expression., 'In multiple cultivars with both methods, decreasing
    the accumulation of the vacuolar acid invertase transcript decreased the accumulation
    of reducing sugars in cold-stored tubers.', "In some transformed lines with very
    low invertase gene expression, chips with acceptable color were produced from
    tubers that had been stored at 4 \xB0C for up to six months.", 'At this temperature,
    which is well below that required for cold-induced sweetening to occur, control
    tubers accumulated reducing sugars and chips prepared from them were dark brown
    in color.', 'Compared to untransformed controls, lines with extreme resistance
    to cold-induced sweetening had reductions of acrylamide in chips of 80 % or more.',
  Asparagine and reducing sugars are the two most important substrates for acrylamide
    formation and hence production practices that consistently minimize the accumulation
    of asparagine and reducing sugars are effective ways to minimize acrylamide in
    finished products., 'Extensive research on the effects of fertilizer type, timing
    and amount, irrigation timing, year-to-year variation in climate, storage temperature,
    storage duration and other factors have demonstrated the importance of field and
    storage management on the accumulation of reducing sugars.', These topics have
    been reviewed extensively elsewhere and are not discussed in depth here., The
    affect of field management on asparagine accumulation has not been described in
    comparable detail and much of the data available has been collected since the
    discovery of acrylamide in food., 'The asparagine content of potato tubers at
    harvest and out of storage depends on varietal differences, production year and
    location, and field management practices.', "Storage temperature in the range
    of 2\u201310 \xB0C has been shown to have little effect on tuber asparagine content.",
  'Tuber asparagine content may change with time in storage, but the magnitude and
    direction of these changes may be inconsistent from year to year.', 'For example,
    mean tuber asparagine content for eight varieties stored for 24 weeks did not
    change with storage duration when asparagine contents for each month were averaged
    over 3 years.', 'During individual years, however, the asparagine content for
    some varieties increased during storage while for others it decreased.', Changes
    in tuber asparagine content were also observed in a one-year-long study conducted
    with ten varieties produced by commercial growers in the United Kingdom., 'In
    this case, many of the varieties exhibited a similar pattern in which tuber asparagine
    content increased from November to December, decreased until February, increased
    again until March or April, and decreased in May.', 'In other instances, asparagine
    content varied little during the storage period.', 'Significant year-to-year variation
    in tuber asparagine has been observed, with the amount in some years approximately
    twice as high as in other years.', 'Likewise, variation in tuber asparagine occurs
    when the same variety is grown at different locations during the same year.',
  'Field management practices, especially nitrogen fertilization rates, likely affect
    free asparagine content in tubers.', Several studies have shown that increased
    application of nitrogen fertilizer increased both the total amount of free amino
    acids and the amount of free asparagine in potato tubers., Harvest operations
    and harvest timing influence tuber composition in several ways that have consequences
    for acrylamide formation., 'The most obvious of these is the chemical maturity
    of the tuber at harvest, which in turn determines the ease with which tubers can
    be preconditioned and stored with low reducing sugar contents.', 'Tuber sucrose
    content is used to quantify chemical maturity, with tubers being chemically mature
    when sucrose content declines to a minimum value.', This state of maturity is
    typically reached shortly before vine desiccation., 'Chemical maturity monitoring
    is an established procedure for scheduling harvest of fry processing and chipping
    potatoes because of the need to maintain low reducing sugars in tubers, and the
    success of the approach in meeting this expectation.', 'For fry processing varieties
    such as Russet Burbank that are susceptible to sugar-end defects, sucrose and
    glucose contents at harvest may not adequately indicate potential of the crop
    for long-term storage with low amounts of reducing sugars.', Harvest timing also
    influences eventual acrylamide formation in ways that are independent of tuber
    maturity., Harvests that occur after a period of cold weather are detrimental
    in that cool soil temperatures can initiate cold-induced sweetening and reducing
    sugar accumulation., Harvests that impose a temperature or mechanical stress on
    the tubers are likely to increase tuber sucrose content., 'Since sucrose production
    is a common response to many stresses, damage during harvest increases the potential
    for reducing sugar accumulation.', Identifying superior varieties that have a
    genetic predisposition for low acrylamide-forming potential will be an important
    aspect of a complete acrylamide mitigation portfolio., Tailoring processing conditions
    to minimize acrylamide formation will be another aspect., Numerous technological
    approaches have been shown to have the potential to reduce acrylamide formation
    during high temperature processing., 'Most of these approaches fall in to one
    of three categories; blanching or presoaking, chemical additions to soaking solutions
    used prior to cooking, and modifications to cooking conditions.', Presoaking fresh
    potato slices in solutions with various compositions is one acrylamide mitigation
    approach that has the goal of reducing the content of acrylamide precursors.,
  Blanching in warm water is the simplest of these approaches that is an extension
    of the standard fry processing method., "Soaking potato products in warm water,
    typically 50 to 85 \xB0C, decreases the content of reducing sugars and asparagine
    in the uncooked product.", Removal of sugars from the cell walls of tuber tissue
    relies on diffusion alone and for surface layers is likely to be relatively rapid.,
  'Removing sugars from the cell cytoplasm and vacuoles is likely to be slower, even
    when cell membranes have ruptured from increased osmotic pressure.', "Blanching
    times of 3 to 10 min at 80 to 85 \xB0C decreased reducing sugar and asparagine
    in raw product sufficiently that final acrylamide contents decreased by 60 %.",
  This approach is likely to be limited to use in french fries and similar processed
    products with little application in chips., Blanching followed by spraying on
    or soaking in a solution of dextrose is used in industry to even out the color
    of finished fries and provide consistent fried potato flavor in final product.,
  This process was shown to decrease the acrylamide content of finished fries relative
    to fries prepared without added dextrose when both were cooked to a similar color.,
  French fries were prepared from tubers with a range of reducing sugar contents to
    produce products having a range of acrylamide and fried product color., Additional
    fries were prepared from cut strips that were blanched and then dipped in glucose
    solutions., 'Across a wide range of finished product color and acrylamide content,
    fries produced by blanching followed by adding back glucose had less acrylamide
    than fries produced from fresh-cut strips when comparisons were made between products
    with the same color.', It was hypothesized that this could be attributed to a
    the higher rate of acrylamide formation relative to color development that occurs
    with fructose relative to glucose., 'Blanching removed both reducing sugars equally
    well, but only glucose was added back.', Additional data support this hypothesis.,
  'When blanched fries were dipped for 30 s in solutions with different ratios of
    glucose to fructose but the same total reducing sugar amount, higher amounts of
    acrylamide were observed in those cases when the ratio of fructose to glucose
    was greater than one.', The difference in acrylamide content between fries produced
    by blanching and dipping in solutions of 100 % glucose or 100 % fructose increased
    substantially as fry color darkened from 70 to 50 on the Agtron scale., Numerous
    chemicals have been added to presoaking solutions to lower subsequent acrylamide
    formation., In some cases the goal is to more effectively reduce the amount of
    acrylamide precursors in the uncooked product., 'In other cases, the goal is to
    incorporate compounds into the uncooked products that will interfere with acrylamide-forming
    reactions.', 'Organic acids such as citric acid, lactic acid and acetic acid have
    been used in presoaking solutions to decrease the pH of the solution within uncooked
    products.', The goal in this case is to increase the protonation of asparagine.,
  This decreases dramatically the reactivity of asparagine in acrylamide-forming reactions
    and decreases substantially the amount of acrylamide in finished products., Soaking
    or blanching with Na+ or Ca2+ ions has also been shown to reduce acrylamide formation
    in several instances., 'It has been suggested that they may act by reducing the
    reactivity of asparagine in acrylamide-forming reactions, and, for Ca2+, a decrease
    in pH though displacement of protons.', 'Soaking or blanching with free amino
    acids such as glycine, cysteine and lysine also has the potential to reduce acrylamide
    formation.', 'While blanching is an effective way to lower the reducing sugar
    content in the surface layer of fries, there are difficulties in implementing
    this approach to achieve large reductions in acrylamide content.', The biggest
    challenge lies in maintaining acceptable sensory characteristics of finished products.,
  'The adverse effects of blanching, with or without additions, can include loss of
    starch and consequent increased oil absorption, shrinkage of raw product leading
    to decreased recovery in finished products and higher input costs, and changes
    in finished product texture and taste.', 'The enzyme asparaginase, which uses
    asparagine as a substrate to produce aspartic acid and ammonia, has been used
    with success to minimize acrylamide formation in products made from dough.', 'Asparaginase
    can be incorporated into the dough for cookies, crackers, corn chips, and other
    products where it enzymatically decreases the asparagine content of the dough
    in a highly controllable manner.', Reducing the acrylamide content of potato products
    with aspariginase is more difficult because those products are fabricated from
    fresh vegetable slices instead of dough., 'The walls and membranes of the cells
    within raw chips and fries are barriers to entry for aspariginase that prevent
    the enzyme from reaching its substrate asparagine, most of which is located in
    vacuoles and amyloplasts.', 'Methods that make uncooked or partially cooked tissues
    more permeable to the enzyme have been slightly more successful, but create many
    of the same difficulties in terms of oligoleptic properties as blanching with
    or without chemical additions.', 'Lactic acid bacteria, rather than purified enzymes,
    have also been used to reduce acrylamide production.', Raw product is introduced
    into a soaking solution containing live bacteria prior to processing., The bacteria
    degrade reducing sugars as part of their metabolism and produce lactic acid in
    the process., 'As described above, both of these processes reduce final acrylamide
    formation.', 'Some lactic acid bacteria also consume asparagine, and this is another
    potential means for acrylamide reduction.', Whether or not oil composition affects
    acrylamide formation has been the subject of several studies., 'In general, these
    studies have not found significant differences in acrylamide formation when the
    same materials were cooked using a range of oils.', 'Rapeseed, olive, corn, soybean,
    sunflower, and grapeseed oil, for example, all produced fries with comparable
    amounts of acrylamide.', This might seem paradoxical in light of the presumed
    interaction between antioxidants and acrylamide formation., It might be expected
    that oils differing in antioxidant content would produce different amounts of
    acrylamide., 'That differences were not observed suggests that the acrylamide-forming
    reactions occur in the aqueous milieu of the potato tissue, and have little interaction
    with the oil/water interface.', Lowering cooking temperature decreases acrylamide
    content of products in many instances., An extreme case of low-temperature cooking
    is frying under vacuum., The theory behind this approach is that water is readily
    removed from potato chips or fries at low temperatures if the atmospheric pressures
    is less than that required for water to boil., This method was successful on a
    small scale., "Chips fried at 118 \xB0C for 4 min at 10 Torr had 84\u201397 %
    less acrylamide than those fried under traditional conditions of 165 \xB0C for
    3 min.", 'Tuber lots used for processing are routinely evaluated at the processing
    plant for sugar content, specific gravity, fry color and the presence of defects.',
  'How acrylamide mitigations efforts affect this process will depend, in part, on
    the goal of the evaluation process.', 'For example, if there is a requirement
    that processed products meet specific targets for acrylamide, then loads may be
    rejected if there is a concern that finished product will exceed those limits.',
  Implementation of quality control in this case would be complicated because near
    real time measurements of acrylamide are not available., 'Instead, processors
    may need to rely on varietal characteristics and fried product color to estimate
    likely acrylamide content in finished products.', 'Chips, fries and other processed
    potato products are often not uniform from end to end and side to side.', 'For
    chips and fries at least, this reflects inherent spatial variation in tuber composition
    for starch, sucrose, reducing sugars, enzymes and many other compounds.', 'Where
    differences in reducing sugar content are large, they may result in defects, such
    as sugar-end defect of fry processing tubers and stem-end chip defect in chip
    stock.', 'The importance of defects such as these, as well as those caused by
    cold-induced sweetening and senescent sweetening, needs to be re-evaluated in
    the context of acrylamide mitigation.', Sugar-related defects are likely to have
    higher acrylamide contents than defect-free product., 'For this reason, acrylamide
    mitigation strategies for potato are likely to contain stringent quality control
    measures for raw and finished product.', These measures may include optical scanners
    that identify products with defects and remove them from the production line prior
    to packaging., This technology has already been implemented at many potato processing
    plants., Producing processed potato products with low amounts of acrylamide requires
    doing many things well., 'This is especially true in the near term when low asparagine
    varieties of potato will not be available, and acrylamide content will depend
    strongly on keeping reducing sugar content to a minimum.', 'Several decades of
    potato research and processing expertise have made it clear that doing this consistently
    throughout the year, every year, will be a tremendous challenge for the potato
    industry.', 'Unfavorable climatic conditions and errors in field management, storage,
    shipping, and processing have the potential to cause spikes in acrylamide content
    that will be difficult or expensive to remove later in the supply chain.', 'It
    remains to be seen how the details of this cooperative process will evolve, but
    it seems clear that acrylamide will remain a concern for all aspects of the potato
    industry for many years.', What is less clear is how great the risk of acrylamide
    consumption is to human health., 'This is an active area of research worldwide,
    and some of the relevant data are summarized in the following section.', Most
    non-smokers in the developed world are exposed to acrylamide primarily through
    the foods that they eat., It has been estimated that more than one-third of the
    calories consumed each day come from foods with detectable levels of acrylamide.,
  'Monitoring programs were initiated in Europe and North America soon after the discovery
    of acrylamide in food in order to determine which foods contained acrylamide,
    how much was present at various times throughout the year, and how much acrylamide
    was being ingested by consumers.', 'Surveys were made over several years to see
    if the acrylamide content of individual food items decreased, as might be expected
    if acrylamide mitigation measures had been put into practice.', In most cases
    the foods sampled were processed products purchased from grocery stores and restaurants.,
  Table 1 summarize some of the findings on total acrylamide exposure in several countries
    and illustrates the range of values found., 'Also indicated, when available, is
    the percentage of total exposure that was attributable to potato products.', 'In
    the US, approximately 38 % of dietary acrylamide comes from processed potato products.',
  'Data for the acrylamide content in processed products including potato chips, french
    fries, cookies, crackers, and coffee have been collected over several years.',
  The results of the Canadian effort are illustrative of trends and challenges faced
    in reducing the acrylamide content of potato chips., The average acrylamide content
    of potato chips was found to vary within each year and from year to year., Similar
    data have been reported from Germany., Chip brand had a significant effect on
    average acrylamide content., There was a general trend in which some brands were
    higher in acrylamide content than others., 'For french fries baked at home, similar
    trends in terms of year-to-year variation existed.', 'These data are limited to
    specific locations and a few brands, and it may be that some regions or brands
    have achieved larger reductions in acrylamide content.', 'However, the data available
    suggest that it has been difficult to consistently reduce the acrylamide content
    of processed potato products with existing varieties without incurring unacceptable
    cost or changes in product quality.', That potential acrylamide mitigation measures
    have not been implemented sucessfully in many potato products has led some to
    suggest that only measures by the authorities will achieve improvements., Acrylamide
    content in three brands of potato chips sampled at multiple times each year from
    2002 to 2008., Data extracted from., 'Variation in acrylamide content between
    brands and sampling dates is apparent






    Although early health studies related to acrylamide focused almost exclusively
    on its role as a neurotoxin, the current concern over acrylamide in food has centered
    on acrylamide as a potential carcinogen or compound that alters pre- or postnatal
    development.', This shift in emphasis reflects data from clinical research and
    epidemiological studies indicating that the margin of safety for neurotoxicity
    is larger than for carcinogenesis., It also reflects the underlying assumptions
    about how cancer-causing agents promote disease and how those differ from assumptions
    about toxicity., The hazards associated with ingestion of toxic substances are
    typically viewed as increasing in severity as dosage increases., 'For a toxic
    compound, very low amounts produce non-detectable effects on health that are routinely
    ignored, whereas higher amounts lead to acute toxicity symptoms.', Safety regulations
    for such compounds are based on the highest amount of the compound that leads
    to no-observed effects., Allowable amounts of the compound are less than this
    amount by some margin of safety., 'Carcinogens have traditionally been viewed
    differently, with the rate of incidence, but not the severity, of cancer increasing
    with exposure to the compound.', 'The rational for this difference is that cancer
    causing agents are stochastic, with each molecule of a carcinogen having a small
    but equal probability of causing a mutation that leads to cancer.', The severity
    of the resulting cancer depends on the type of cancer and how rapidly it grows.,
  'In simplistic terms, carcinogens are managed to limit cumulative exposure whereas
    toxins are managed to remain below thresholds.', 'Below we summarize some of the
    laboratory, clinical and epidemiological data related to acrylamide in food as
    it relates to cancer or developmental changes.', 'Questions that are invariably
    raised when evaluating research in this area include the relative sensitivity
    of rodents and humans to acrylamide-induced cancers, how accurately data derived
    from experiments that use relatively high doses of acrylamide can be extrapolated
    to the trace amounts found in food, and how age and other environmental factors
    influence the susceptibility of humans to acrylamide exposure.', 'A clear answer
    to these questions is not available, but the numerous research studies on acrylamide
    and cancer that have been conducted in the past decade shed some light on each
    of them.', The following section reviews some of this data in order to illustrate
    the current status of this research., The excellent reviews by are recommended
    for those who would like additional information in this area., 'Experiments using
    rat and mouse models have shown clearly that dietary acrylamide can induce benign
    and cancerous tumors, as well as neurological and developmental defects.', 'Doses
    administered to animals were at least 20 times higher than that found in food,
    with one exception, and in some cases several thousand times higher, as is typical
    of toxicology and carcinogenicity studies that use rodent models.', 'Margins of
    exposure for non-carcinogenic effects, which are a ratio of the maximum level
    of a compound at which there is no observed adverse effect and actual amount of
    exposure to that compound, were large enough that risk for neurotoxicity appears
    to be negligible.', 'For carcinogenic effects, where accepted margins of safety
    are larger than they are for non-carcinogenic effects, MOEs were sufficiently
    small that the animal studies pointed to a risk of cancer due to dietary intake
    of acrylamide.', 'In one study that highlights this concern, chronic exposure
    of mice to acrylamide in drinking water was shown to generate DNA damage in male
    germ cells.', "Acrylamide was administered at rates that ranged from 0.1 \u03BCg
    kg\u22121 d\u22121 to 1,000 \u03BCg kg\u22121 d\u22121.", 'Dose-dependent increases
    in DNA damage were observed after 6, 9 and 12 months.', "At the 12-month sampling
    period, damage was detected at doses as low as 1 \u03BCg kg\u22121 d\u22121.",
  'Significantly, this dose of acrylamide is comparable to that consumed by humans
    in food.', 'Research conducted with rats and mice has shown clearly that acrylamide
    administered as a pure compound or as acrylamide-rich food can contribute to the
    development of benign tumors, cancers and developmental defects.', 'Studies similar
    to these, where high doses of a potentially toxic or mutagenic compound are fed
    to subjects and effects on health are monitored for a short period of time, cannot
    be done with humans.', 'Available options are to extrapolate the findings from
    short-term, high-dosage rodent experiments to long-term, low-dosage exposures
    typical for humans, or to conduct epidemiological studies that follow cohorts
    of subjects over a long period of time and relate health outcomes to specific
    risk factors.', 'In order to correctly extrapolate data from rodent studies to
    humans, one needs data on whether or not rodents and human are similar or different
    with regard to efficiency of acrylamide elimination, amounts of acrylamide converted
    to glycidamide, modes of action for promoting disease for acrylamide and glycidamide,
    shape of the dose response curve for each particular disease, susceptibility of
    different ages and sexes to disease development, and the contribution that other
    environmental factors make toward promoting or slowing disease progression.',
  'These relationships between rodents and humans are not well characterized, in most
    cases, although progress is being made in some areas.', Epidemiological studies
    present challenges of their own., 'For acrylamide research, one of the largest
    challenges is that exposure rates are based on food frequency questionnaires that
    are used to calculate daily acrylamide ingestion using average values for acrylamide
    content of individual food groups.', These calculations do not typically take
    into account variation in acrylamide content that occurs between brands or at
    different times of year., 'Food surveys may also be problematic because they are
    typically taken during a subset of the years that members of the cohort are being
    followed, and therefore do not capture changes in diet that might have occurred
    at earlier or later times.', Early epidemiological studies on occupational and
    dietary exposure to acrylamide found no consistent evidence of association with
    human cancer risk., 'In order to reduce errors associated with restricted sample
    sizes and increase the power of the analysis, data from an integrated network
    of Italian and Swiss hospital-based case-control studies were reanalyzed to assess
    the relationship between dietary acrylamide intake and cancers of the oral cavity
    and pharynx, esophagus, large bowel, larynx, breast, ovary and prostate.', "In
    all of the seven studies considered, fried and baked potatoes were the major contributors
    of acrylamide, accounting for 36\u201344 % of intake.", No association was found
    between dietary acrylamide intake and risk of any of the cancers investigated.,
  'In discussing this finding, Pelucchi et al.', noted that debate continues on the
    actual risk levels to humans related to acrylamide intake in consideration of
    discordant findings of animal and epidemiologic studies., They suggest two major
    lines of reasoning to explain this inconsistency., 'The first line of reasoning
    considers the limitations of extrapolating animal data to humans given the uncertain
    bioavailability of acrylamide after ingestion, as well as differences in the metabolism
    of acrylamide, and the different level of exposure between laboratory data and
    human diet.', The second line of reasoning criticizes epidemiologic studies for
    their limited power., An analysis of epidemiological data published in journal
    articles prior to June 2009 was carried out to determine if associations between
    acrylamide exposure and cancer could be uncovered when results from multiple studies
    were combined., 'Of the papers included in the analysis, 19 publications reported
    results on dietary intake of acrylamide, two publications reported results on
    biomarkers of exposure and six publications reported results on occupational exposure.',
  The authors conducted meta-analyses of studies of dietary intake based on random-effects
    models by calculating pooled relative risks and the corresponding 95 % confidence
    intervals., Results of occupational studies were combined according to a fixed-effect
    model., The authors overall conclusion was that available studies consistently
    suggest a lack of an increased risk of most types of cancer from exposure to acrylamide.,
  'The exception was for kidney cancer, which, the authors suggested, requires further
    monitoring.', Specific attention was given to studies on consumption of potatoes
    cooked at high temperatures and cancer., 'These studies looked at potential cancer
    of the oral cavity and pharynx, esophagus, colorectum, larynx, lung, breast, ovary,
    prostate, bladder, kidney, and childhood brain.', 'The authors note that significant
    positive associations have been reported in five case-control studies on cancer
    risk from intake of acrylamide-rich foods, but that these are vulnerable to selection
    and report bias.', "Furthermore, they note that the positive results referred
    to five different types of cancer and selective reporting of \u2018positive\u2019
    or \u2018significant\u2019 associations can take place in studies assessing large
    sets of food items.", "The association between acrylamide intake and breast cancer
    risk among 90,628 premenopausal women in the Nurses\u2019 Health Study II was
    assessed.", 'Acrylamide intake was calculated from 130-item food frequency questionnaires
    in 1991, 1995, 1999, and 2003.', 'The authors found no associations between intakes
    of foods high in acrylamide, including french fries, coffee, cereal, potato chips,
    potatoes, and baked goods, and breast cancer risk.', They found no evidence that
    acrylamide intake within the range of US diets is associated with increased risk
    of premenopausal breast cancer., 'Also, there was no association for estrogen
    receptor/progesterone receptor positive or negative cancers or by smoking status.',
  "An analysis of the UK women\u2019s cohort, 33,731 women aged 35\u201369 who have
    been followed for a median of 11 years, was conducted to evaluate a possible link
    between acrylamide consumption in food and breast cancer.", "Women in the study
    completed a 217-item food frequency questionnaire during 1995 to 1998 and this
    was used to estimate a mean acrylamide intake of 0.23 \u03BCg kg\u22121 day\u22121,
    28 % of which was attributed to french fries and 14 % to potato chips.", 'Overall,
    there was little evidence of an association between dietary acrylamide intake
    and breast cancer when premenopausal and postmenopausal cancers were combined.',
  There was some evidence for a positive association with premenopausal breast cancer.,
  "Although there was a weak dose\u2013response relationship, the association was
    particularly apparent in the highest fifth of dietary intake.", 'Given that smoking
    is not a risk factor for breast cancer and that smokers have substantially higher
    levels of hemoglobin adducts of acrylamide and glycidamide than non-smokers, and
    much higher levels than those associated with dietary intake, it was surprising
    that they found an association between dietary intake and breast cancer.', They
    recommend that it will be important to repeat the analyses amongst a subgroup
    of subjects who have never smoked., 'One of the early prospective cohort studies
    to address the question of the carcinogenicity of acrylamide in food used data
    from the Netherlands Cohort Study on diet and food to examine potential associations
    between endometrial, ovarian and breast cancer in post-menopausal women.', "Subjects
    included in the analysis had average daily exposure to dietary acrylamide of 0.32
    \xB1 0.19 \u03BCg kg\u22121 d\u22121 with coffee and Dutch spiced cake being the
    most important contributors to total dietary acrylamide.", 'Increased risks of
    postmenopausal endometrial and ovarian cancer were observed with increasing dietary
    acrylamide intake, particularly among never-smokers.', Risk of breast cancer was
    not associated with acrylamide intake., "The association with ovarian cancer was
    not found in a prior case\u2013control study and in the Swedish Mammography cohort.",
  'The range of acrylamide exposure in the Swiss study was narrower than that in the
    Dutch study, and this could have reduced the possibility of detecting an association
    if one exists.', Epidemiological studies use food frequency questionnaires to
    determine acrylamide exposure., 'This indirect approach may not account for variation
    in acrylamide content that occurs within and between products of the same type,
    nor does it account for variation in home cooking methods and personal preferences
    that may result in higher acrylamide contents in similar items depending on how
    they are prepared.', An alternative method for assessing acrylamide exposure is
    to use acrylamide and glycidamide adducts of hemoglobin as biomarkers for exposure
    to acrylamide and it genotoxic metabolite glycidamide., A study of 374 breast
    cancer cases and 274 controls from a cohort of postmenopausal women found that
    increased incidence of estrogen receptor positive breast cancer was associated
    with higher concentrations of acrylamide adducts after adjusting for smoking behavior.,
  Women with the highest concentrations of acrylamide adducts of hemoglobin had 2.7
    times increased risk of estrogen receptor positive breast cancer when compared
    to women with the lowest concentrations., The weaker association observed between
    breast cancer risk and concentrations of gycidamide adducts compared to acrylamide
    adducts led the authors to suggest that acrylamide might induce cancer by a nongenotoxic
    mechanism., Biomarkers for acrylamide ingestion were also used in a pilot study
    to investigate the possible connection between chronic ingestion of acrylamide-containing
    potato chips and oxidative stress or inflammation., Fourteen healthy volunteers
    were given 160 g of potato chips containing 157 mg acrylamide daily for 4 week.,
  An increase in acrylamide-hemoglobin adducts in blood was found in all the study
    subjects., 'Concurrently, a significant increase in the oxidized LDL, high-sensitivity
    interleukin-6, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and c-glutamyltransferase
    concentrations was observed in both smokers and nonsmokers.', 'A significant increase
    in reactive oxygen radical production by monocytes, lymphocytes, and granulocytes
    and an increase in CD14 expression in macrophages were found after intake of potato
    chips.', 'Twenty-eight days from the discontinuation of the experiment, the variables
    under study decreased to some extent.', The authors concluded that chronic ingestion
    of dietary acrylamide might induce oxidative stress in humans through leukocyte
    activation and increased production of reactive oxygen radicals., They also suggest
    that long-term ingestion of high-acrylamide doses with food may cause chronic
    inflammation and contribute to the development of early atherosclerosis as well
    as increase the risk of coronary artery disease., The need to corroborate this
    pilot study by others was noted., The possibility that acrylamide might affect
    prenatal development of humans was examined in a study that used hemoglobin adducts
    of acrylamide and glycidamide in umbilical cord blood as biomarkers for acrylamide
    exposure in utero., 'The study included 1,101 women from five countries who gave
    birth from 2006 to 2010.', The amounts of acrylamide and glycidamide adducts in
    cord blood were found to correlate with the amount in maternal blood and with
    acrylamide intake of mothers based on food frequency questionnaires., Higher levels
    of acrylamide and glycidamide adducts in cord blood were also associated with
    a significant decrease in birth weight., The estimated difference in birth weights
    for infants in the lowest versus highest quartile of acrylamide adducts after
    adjusting for gestational age and country was 132 g for the study as a whole and
    107 g for non-smokers., "Adjustments for factors such as infant gender and mother\u2019s
    pre-pregnancy body mass index, age, previous children, ethnicity, education and
    dietary pattern did not alter the association between highest acrylamide quartiles
    and lowest birth weight.", 'These data do not prove that increased acrylamide
    exposure reduces birth weight, as noted by the authors, since acrylamide adducts
    may have been acting as proxy markers for another dietary exposure or mix of exposures
    that were responsible for the associations observed, or for a less healthy diet
    in general.', 'Despite this caveat, they conclude that, if confirmed, their findings
    suggest that dietary intake of acrylamide should be reduced among pregnant women.',
  'In the decade since acrylamide was first discovered in food, considerable progress
    has been made in our understanding of acrylamide formation chemistry, how potato
    processing variables influence final product acrylamide content, and how production
    practices and potato storage conditions influence acrylamide-forming potential
    of potato tubers.', The central importance of raw product characteristics and
    the need for potato varieties that consistently maintain low tuber reducing sugar
    and asparagine contents has been demonstrated clearly in numerous research reports.,
  Equally important may be the need to implement potato processing techniques that
    have the greatest potential to limit acrylamide formation., The consequences of
    acrylamide ingestion on human health are less well understood despite intensive
    research efforts in this area., Uncertainty remains with regard to the need for
    aggressive measures to reduce acrylamide in processed potato products and the
    potential for regulatory actions to limit acrylamide content in foods., An acrylamide
    mitigation portfolio will necessarily include deployment of potato varieties that
    consistently maintain low reducing sugar contents in tubers with few defects in
    final products., 'These goals are aligned with long-standing needs of the potato
    industry; acrylamide mitigation efforts in these areas will provide benefits to
    potato producers, processors and consumers that do not depend on their ability
    to produce low acrylamide products.', "This review is part of NIFA SCRI research
    project 2011-51181-30829 \u201CImproved breeding and variety evaluation methods
    to reduce acrylamide content and increase quality in processed potato products\u201D."]
