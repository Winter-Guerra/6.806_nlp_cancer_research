[Anthocyanins widely present in human diet and have a variety of health effects.,
  This study investigates the anticancer effects of an anthocyanin-rich extract from
    black rice on breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo., 'AEBR reduced the viability
    of breast cancer cell lines MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, and MDA-MB-453 and induced apoptosis
    in MDA-MB-453 cells via the intrinsic pathway in vitro by activating caspase cascade,
    cleaving poly polymerase, depolarizing mitochondrial membrane potential, and releasing
    cytochrome C. Oral administration of AEBR to BALB/c nude mice bearing MDA-MB-453
    cell xenografts significantly suppressed tumor growth and angiogenesis by suppressing
    the expression of angiogenesis factors MMP-9, MMP-2, and uPA in tumor tissue.',
  'Altogether, this study suggests the anticancer effects of AEBR against human breast
    cancer cells in vitro and in vivo by inducing apoptosis and suppressing angiogenesis.']
