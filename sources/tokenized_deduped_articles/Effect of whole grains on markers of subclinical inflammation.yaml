['The reduction of subclinical inflammation has been suggested as a potential mechanism
    to explain the favorable association between whole-grain consumption and reduced
    risk for cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and certain cancers.', This review
    examines evidence for the effects of whole-grain consumption on markers of subclinical
    inflammation derived from 13 epidemiological and 5 interventional studies retrieved
    from a search of the PubMed database., Epidemiological studies provide reasonable
    support for an association between diets high in whole grains and lower C-reactive
    protein concentrations., 'After adjusting for other dietary factors, each serving
    of whole grains is estimated to reduce CRP concentrations by approximately 7%.',
  'In contrast to epidemiological studies, interventional studies do not demonstrate
    a clear effect of increased whole-grain consumption on CRP or other markers of
    inflammation.', 'Issues related to insufficient length of intervention, extent
    of dietary control, population selection, types of whole grains, and lack of a
    direct anti-inflammatory effect may underlie these discrepant findings.', Additional
    carefully controlled interventional studies are needed to clarify the effects
    of whole grains on subclinical inflammation.]
