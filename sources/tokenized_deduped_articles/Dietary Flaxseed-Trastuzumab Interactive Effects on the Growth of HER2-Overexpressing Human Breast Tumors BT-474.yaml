[Flaxseed reduces breast tumorigenesis and human epidermal growth factor receptor
    2 expression in postmenopausal patients and animal models., The primary treatment
    for HER2-overexpressing tumors is trastuzumab., FS oil enhances TRAS effectiveness
    in athymic mice but the FS effect is unknown and was therefore determined., 'Athymic
    mice with established BT-474 tumors were fed the basal diet, or 10% FS diet, with
    or without TRAS treatment for 5 wk.', "After 2 wk, TRAS and FS reduced tumor size
    with a trend for an FS \xD7 TRAS interaction; however, after 5 wk, only TRAS reduced
    tumor size and increased tumor apoptosis.", FS did not further improve TRAS effect
    but increased overall survival., "TRAS reduced signaling biomarkers , FS reduced
    phosphorylated-Akt1 protein, and FS \xD7 TRAS interactions were seen for HER2
    mRNA and phosphorylated-Akt1 protein.", 'FS, with and without TRAS, increased
    tumor n-3 PUFA levels and serum lignans indicating potential roles in the observed
    effect.', 'In conclusion, TRAS reduces tumor growth by influencing HER2 signaling.',
  'Dietary FS has minimal tumor-reducing effect, does not interfere with TRAS action,
    but improves overall survival in athymic mice.']
