  'To confirm that TIMP-3 induction by GTPs play a major role in decreasing in MMP-2/MMP-9
    activity, we studied the direct effect of EGCG and GTP on MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression
    levels in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells.', MMP-2 mRNA levels were found to be negligible
    in both cell lines., MMP-9 levels were relatively low in MCF-7 cells as compared
    to MDA-MB-231 cells., EGCG and GTP treatment had no significant effect on MMP-9
    levels in either of the cell lines., 'Although we did not observe any effect of
    EGCG/GTP on MMP-2/MMP-9 expression, further studies are needed to determine the
    exact quantitative contribution of TIMP-3 in MMP-2 and MMP-9 inhibition.', 'In
    recent years, GTPs have been demonstrated to elicit a multifunctional effect in
    impeding various molecular pathways involved in neoplastic transformation and
    metastasis in various cancer types including breast cancer .', This is the first
    study to demonstrate that the epigenetic induction of TIMP-3 may be one of the
    key mechanisms by which GTPs suppress MMP-2/-9 activity and tumor invasion in
    breast cancer cells., We also provided a novel mechanistic insight into the epigenetic
    regulation of TIMP-3 gene in breast cancer cells., 'TIMP-3 is a ubiquitously expressed,
    ECM bound protein that acts as an endogenous inhibitor of MMPs and inhibit apoptosis,
    invasion and angiogenesis .', Reduced expression of TIMP-3 protein was associated
    with poorly differentiated and aggressive breast carcinoma of higher nuclear and
    histological grades ., Down-regulation of TIMP-3 expression was predominantly
    attributed to promoter DNA hypermethylation however only 20% breast tumor specimens
    display TIMP-3 methylation ., 'In the present study, we demonstrated that aberrant
    histone modification patterns at the TIMP-3 promoter contributes to its epigenetic
    silencing, independent of promoter DNA hypermethylation, at least, in breast cancer
    cell lines.', 'We used two human breast adenocarcinoma cell lines: MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231
    as our in vitro models as they represent two different phenotypes of breast cancer.',
  'Hypermethylation in TIMP-3 promoter was not detected in breast cancer cell lines
    used in our study and accordingly, there was no significant induction in TIMP-3
    mRNA levels after treatment with demethylating agent 5-Aza-CdR.', This observation
    is supported by another study which also reported that there was no TIMP-3 hypermethylation
    in mammary cancer cell lines ., 'Unlike MDA-MB-231 cells, there was a significant
    induction in TIMP-3 protein levels after 5-Aza-CdR treatment in MCF-7 cells.',
  One possible explanation for this observation may be the direct effect of 5-Aza-CdR
    treatment on the modified histone marks such as H3K27me3 on the TIMP-3 promoter
    in MCF-7 cells., This observation is in line with a previous study which showed
    the effect of 5-Aza-CdR treatment on histone modification marks such as H3K27me3
    in target genes which do not display promoter methylation ., We showed that treatment
    of breast cancer cells with TSA and DZNep could reverse TIMP-3 repression., 'Furthermore,
    genetic knockdown studies confirmed the involvement of histone methyltransferase
    EZH2 and class I HDACs in TIMP-3 repression.', 'EZH2, the catalytic subunit of
    PRC2, tri-methylates Histone H3 at lysine-27, which serves as repressive mark
    in maintaining the silenced state of several genes during development and establishing
    embryonic stem cell identity.', 'Recent findings in breast cancer implicate that
    EZH2 protein levels increase through successive stages of neoplastic transformation
    , and enhanced EZH2 catalyzed H3K27me3 repressive mark results in the silencing
    of various critical tumor suppressor genes .', 'Similarly, abnormally high activity
    of HDACs has been linked to deacetylation and aberrant repression of several critical
    genes in breast cancer .', Our studies showed that decreased TIMP-3 expression
    in breast cancer cells MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 is associated with elevated EZH2 and
    class I HDAC levels., ChIP studies demonstrated that decreased EZH2 and repressive
    H3K27me3 chromatin modification and a corresponding increase in H3K9/18 Ac by
    combined DZNep and TSA treatment de-repress TIMP-3 locus in both breast cancer
    cell lines., Recent studies in prostate cancer also demonstrated an inverse correlation
    between EZH2 and HDAC-1/2/3 levels to TIMP-3 expression ., 'To our knowledge,
    this is the first study that provides a detailed mechanistic insight into the
    epigenetic induction of TIMP-3 by GTP and EGCG in breast cancer.', 'We showed
    that GTP and EGCG treatment significantly decreased EZH2 protein levels and hence
    its localization and catalytic activity, that is, H3K27me3 enrichment at the promoter
    region.', 'Also, there was a significant decrease in HDAC-2 and HDAC-8 levels
    in MCF-7 and HDAC-1, HDAC-3 and HDAC-8 levels in MDA-MB-231 cells after treatment
    with GTP and EGCG, which might have altered the balance between the histone acetyltransferases
    and HDACs in these breast cancer cells.', This ultimately resulted in the deposition
    of increased transcriptionally active acetylated Histone H3 at Lysine9/18 at the
    TIMP-3 promoter., The underlying mechanism by which GTPs decrease EZH2 and Class
    I HDACs in breast cancer cells is not the focus of the present study and requires
    further investigation., 'However, the present findings are in line with our previous
    studies which suggest that green tea catechins function as potent HDAC inhibitors
    and induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, by enhancing the proteasomal degradation
    of Class I HDACs in prostate cancer cells .', 'Also, a recent study reported that
    EGCG treatment decreased the protein levels of polycomb group members EZH2 and
    Bmi1 in epidermal squamous cell carcinoma cells .', It will be interesting to
    elucidate the effect of GTP/EGCG on histone acetyltransferases which may change
    the dynamic relationship between HDACs/HATs in the tumor cells., 'Focusing on
    the functional effect of EGCG/GTP-mediated TIMP-3 induction on MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231
    cells, we demonstrated by gelatin zymography that there was significant decrease
    in MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity in conditioned media collected from EGCG and GTP treated
    cells for 72 h. Similar decrease in gelatinolytic activity was also observed in
    conditioned media collected from DZNep and TSA treated cells.', 'EGCG has been
    shown to have multifunctional effect on MMP-2 and MMP-9 including their expression,
    activation, secretion, and the induction of some inhibitors such as RECK .', Based
    on previous studies it is arguable that the decrease in gelatinolytic activity
    might be due to direct effect of GTPs on MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression ., But our
    finding suggests that MMP-2 mRNA was negligible in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells
    and is consistent with a previous study ., There was no further inhibitory effect
    of EGCG/GTP treatment on MMP-2 expression., MMP-9 expression levels also remained
    unaffected after EGCG/GTP treatment for 72 h in both cell lines., The reason for
    the divergent findings might have to do with either variability in sub-clones
    of cell lines used or different doses of EGCG and treatment period used during
    the experiments., 'Intriguingly, though MMP-2 mRNA levels were found to very low
    in the cell lines used in our study, the gelatinolytic activity associated with
    MMP-2 was detectable in zymography.', The possible reason may be that gelatin
    zymography is a sensitive technique and can detect as low as 10 pg of MMP-2 .,
  'Also conditioned media used in the experiment represents the sum total of all the
    secreted MMP-2 and MMP-9 in culture medium in a 72-h time period but RT-PCR analysis
    of expression levels reflect the mRNA levels at the end of 72 h. Here we show
    that GTP-mediated TIMP-3 may play a crucial role in shifting MMP: TIMP balance
    toward TIMPs and decrease the elevated gelatinolytic activity frequently observed
    in breast cancer cells.', Further studies are needed to define the extent of contribution
    of TIMP-3 on MMP-2/-9 activity and the suppression of cell invasiveness., 'Based
    on our results, we conclude that the in vitro and in vivo anti-invasive effects
    of EGCG/GTP reported in breast cancer cells may be due to, in part, through epigenetic
    induction of endogenous MMP inhibitor, TIMP-3.', 'Also, our results provide the
    first detailed insight into the epigenetic regulatory mechanism causing TIMP-3
    repression in breast cancer, highlighting the role of histone modifying enzymes
    EZH2 and HDACs.', 'We demonstrated that GTP and EGCG-mediated decrease in EZH2
    and class I HDACs levels caused a corresponding global decrease in repressive
    chromatin mark H3K27me3 and an increase in transcriptionally open chromatin, that
    is, H3K9/18 Ac, respectively, in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells.', 'This coincides
    with decreased EZH2 localization and H3K27me3 enrichment at the TIMP-3 promoter
    with a concomitant increase in H3K9/18 Ac, after GTP and EGCG treatment.', 'Epigenetic
    induction of TIMP-3 may be one of the key mechanisms by which green tea catechins
    shift the MMPs:TIMPs balance toward TIMPs and inhibit active MMPs in breast cancer.',
  "We have used 10 \xB5g/mL GTP and 20 \xB5M EGCG which are physiologically attainable
    concentration and corresponds to drinking 2-3 cups of green tea by an adult individual
    .", 'Although case-control and epidemiological studies provide some clues that
    regular consumption of GTP and EGCG could decrease the risk of breast cancer invasion
    and/or progression, however, these studies do not provide further insight into
    the molecular mechanism, related to tumor inhibition.', 'Based on our present
    findings, TIMP-3 can be used as a surrogate marker of GTP and EGCG response and
    warrants further investigation through well-designed clinical trial.', 'This work
