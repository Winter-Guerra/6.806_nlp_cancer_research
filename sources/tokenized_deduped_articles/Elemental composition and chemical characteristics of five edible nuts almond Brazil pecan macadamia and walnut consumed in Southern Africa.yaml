['The total elemental concentrations and proximate chemical composition of five different
    tree nuts, almond, Brazil, pecan, macadamia and walnut that are consumed in South
    African households were investigated.', 'In addition, six physicochemical properties
    of the extracted nut oils, namely acid value, iodine value, saponification value,
    refractive index, density and specific gravity were evaluated.', A high concentration
    of Se was found in the Brazil nuts only., "With maximum and minimum limits being
    set by the almond and pecan nut samples, Cr ranging from 0.94 \xB1 0.14\u20132.02
    \xB1 0.07 \u03BC g g\u2212 1 was detected in the nut samples.", 'Generally, the
    order of the concentrations of the elements in all the nut samples is found to
    be Mg &gt; Ca &gt; Fe &gt; Cu &gt; Cr &gt; As &gt; Se.', The concentrations of
    Mn and Zn showed greater variation amongst the different types of nuts., 'The
    extracted oils showed low acid values and high saponification values with the
    macadamia nut sample having the highest oil content, the lowest acid value and
    highest saponification value.', The present findings are useful in calculating
    the Dietary Reference Intakes of these nutrients.]
