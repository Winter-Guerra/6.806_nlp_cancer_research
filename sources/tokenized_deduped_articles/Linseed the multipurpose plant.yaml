['The oilseed flax is predominantly the source of valuable oil, in which the most
    appreciated are omega-3 fatty acids.', The extensive biochemical analysis of linseed
    oil resulted in the identification of its other components with potential application
    in improvement of human health., 'The focus is now on them and they are of particular
    interest for human nutrition, cosmetic and pharmaceutical industry.', 'Linseed
    plant also provides seedcakes, fibers and shives as by-products.', The recent
    development of analytical methods allowed to determine several valuable compounds
    in these materials have made them thereby more appealing to industry., 'Besides
    lignocellulose biomass, which is mainly used for components of polymer composites
    or liquid/gas fuel production, phenylpropanoids and terpenoids are the major constituents
    that contribute to bioactive properties of the linseed by-products.', 'Antibacterial,
    antifungal, anticancer, and anti-inflammatory activities are assigned to these
    compounds.', These findings led to the diversification of linseed plant application.,
  'This review outlines oil, seedcake, and fiber and shives biochemistry and describes
    their potential application.', It is expected that the development of value-added
    products from linseed plant might greatly improve the economic viability of its
    cultivation., 'Moreover, the use of linseed plant as a whole to produce innovative
    industrial products would enhance the sustainability of natural resources.']
