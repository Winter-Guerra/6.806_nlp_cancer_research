[Common bean is a pulse cultivated worldwide and it is considered a nutraceutical
    food and a good source of protein., 'In the last decade, pulses have gained attention
    to produce bioactive hydrolysates and peptides.', 'Common bean hydrolysates and
    peptides have been reported to perform mainly angiotensin I converting enzyme
    inhibition, antioxidant capacity, and antimicrobial and tumor cell inhibition
    activities.', 'In this paper, we review the biological activities, the factors
    that can modify the effectiveness of the hydrolysates and peptides present in
    common bean, as well as the proposed mechanisms of action and the perspectives
    of the production of common bean protein hydrolysates to be used as a functional
    ingredient.']
