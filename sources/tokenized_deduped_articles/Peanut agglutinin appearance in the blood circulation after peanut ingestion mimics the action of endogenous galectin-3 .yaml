["Peanut agglutinin, which accounts for ~0.15% of the weight of the common peanut,
    is a carbohydrate-binding protein that binds the oncofoetal Thomsen\u2013Friedenreich
    disaccharide that is overexpressed by ~90% of human cancers.", Previous studies
    have shown that PNA is highly resistant to cooking and digestion and rapidly enters
    the human blood circulation after peanut ingestion., This study investigates the
    hypothesis that PNA appearance in the circulation after peanut ingestion may mimic
    the actions of endogenous TF-binding human galectin-3 in metastasis promotion.,
  'It shows that PNA at concentrations similar to those found in blood circulation
    after peanut ingestion increases cancer cell heterotypic adhesion to the blood
    vascular endothelium and enhances the formation of tumour cell homotypic aggregates,
    two important steps in the metastasis cascade, and enhances metastasis in a mouse
    metastasis model.', 'These effects of PNA are shown to result from its interaction
    with the cancer-associated TF disaccharide on the transmembrane mucin protein
    MUC1, causing MUC1 cell surface polarization that reveals underlying cell surface
    adhesion molecules.', 'Thus, PNA appearance in the blood circulation after peanut
    ingestion mimics the actions of endogenous galectin-3 and promotes cancer cell
    metastatic spread by interaction with cancer-associated TF/MUC1.', 'As metastasis
    accounts for the majority of cancer-associated fatality, regular consumption of
    peanuts by cancer patients would therefore be expected to have an adverse effect
    on cancer survival.']
