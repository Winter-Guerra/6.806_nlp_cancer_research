[Selenium is an important cofactor in the production of antioxidant enzymes that may
    influence cancer progression., 'Selenium intake and cancer survival has not been
    extensively studied; however, selenium supplementation has been demonstrated to
    reduce cancer mortality in nutritional intervention trials.', 'We investigated
    whether dietary selenium intake was associated with survival among 3,146 women
    diagnosed with invasive breast cancer in the population-based Swedish Mammography
    Cohort.', Selenium intake before breast cancer diagnosis was estimated using a
    food frequency questionnaire completed in 1987., 'Cox proportional hazard models
    were used to calculate hazard ratios and 95 % confidence intervals for death from
    breast cancer, non-breast cancer death, and death from any cause.', "During 28,172
    person-years of follow-up from 1987 to 2009, there were 416 breast cancer\u2013specific
    deaths and 964 total deaths.", "Dietary selenium intake was inversely associated
    with breast cancer\u2013specific mortality and overall mortality.", Women in the
    highest quartile of selenium intake had a multivariable HR of death from breast
    cancer of 0.69 compared with those in the lowest quartile., The inverse association
    between dietary selenium intake and breast cancer death appeared strongest among
    women who had ever smoked comparing the highest to lowest quartile., "Our findings
    suggest that selenium intake before breast cancer diagnosis may improve breast
    cancer\u2013specific survival and overall survival.", 'However, these results
    may be limited to populations with low intakes of selenium.', Selenium is an essential
    trace element that is an important cofactor in the production of antioxidant enzymes
    that may influence cancer initiation and progression., 'Animal models support
    a preventive role of selenium in carcinogenesis , while observational epidemiologic
    studies primarily provide some evidence for a role of selenium in prostate cancer
    prevention with less convincing evidence for other cancers .', 'Selenium intake
    and survival following cancer diagnosis has been less extensively studied; however,
    selenium supplementation has been demonstrated to reduce all-cause and cancer
    mortality in some randomized nutritional intervention trials , while in the Selenium
    and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial, selenium supplementation had no influence
    on all-cause mortality .', 'To our knowledge, only two studies have examined the
    association between selenium intake and mortality among women with breast cancer.',
  Holmes et al., "reported a non-significant inverse association between selenium
    intake and all-cause mortality among women in the Nurses\u2019 Health Study .",
  'Conversely, Saquib et al.', observed a non-significant increase in all-cause mortality
    for selenium levels exceeding the U.S. dietary reference upper tolerable limit
    compared with women with adequate intake ., 'In this study, we investigated whether
    pre-diagnosis selenium intake was associated with breast cancer survival among
    women diagnosed with invasive breast cancer in the population-based Swedish Mammography
    Cohort, a population with low selenium intake.', 'We also examined whether the
    association between selenium intake and survival differed by hormone receptor
    status, disease stage at diagnosis, by oxidative stress related factors, and other
    antioxidant micronutrients.', 'This study included 3,146 participants in the Swedish
    Mammography Cohort with invasive breast cancer diagnosed from 1987 to 2008.',
  Recruitment and characteristics of this cohort have been previously described .,
  "In brief, the SMC is a population-based cohort of 66,651 women born between 1914
    and 1948 that were recruited between 1987 and 1990 in V\xE4stmanland and Uppsala
    counties in central Sweden.", 'Participants completed a baseline questionnaire
    with questions regarding diet, reproductive, and other factors.', 'In 1997, a
    second questionnaire was extended to include dietary supplements, physical activity,
    and smoking status and was sent to participants who were still alive and residing
    in the study area; 39,227 women returned this questionnaire.', 'Those with an
    incorrect or missing national registration number, previous cancer diagnosis,
    and implausible total energy intake were excluded from the baseline cohort.',
  Completion and return of the self-administered questionnaire was treated as informed
    consent of study participants., The study was approved by the ethics committee
    at the Karolinska Institutet., Histologically confirmed incident invasive breast
    cancer cases were ascertained by linkage of the study cohort with the Swedish
    Cancer Registry., This registry has been estimated to provide almost 100 % complete
    case ascertainment ., Estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor status and other
    clinical characteristics were obtained by reviewing pathology laboratory works
    logs from Uppsala University Hospital and by linkage with the clinical database
    at the Regional Oncology Centre in Uppsala., 'ER and PR status, menopausal status
    at diagnosis, tumor size, grade, lymph node involvement, and type of treatment
    were available for approximately 77 % of the cases.', More detailed information
    on the evaluation of hormone receptor status in this cohort has been described
    previously ., Diet was assessed using a 67-item food frequency questionnaire at
    baseline and a 96-item FFQ in 1997., 'Participants were asked how often, on average,
    they had consumed each food item or beverage during the previous 6 months or year.',
  Eight responses were possible ranging from never or seldom to four or more times
    per day., Information on dietary supplement use was not obtained at baseline.,
  Selenium intake was calculated as the frequency of consumption of each food item
    multiplied by its selenium content per age-specific serving using food composition
    values obtained from the Swedish National Food Administration Database ., The
    baseline FFQ has been previously validated for foods that were the main sources
    of dietary selenium in our population., "Among 129 participants randomly chosen
    from the study population, correlation coefficients between the questionnaire
    and the mean of four 1-week dietary records ranged 0.4\u20130.5 for fish , 0.3\u20130.6
    for milk , 0.3\u20130.7 for meat products , and 0.5 for eggs .", Nutrient intakes
    were adjusted for energy using the residual method ., Date of death was identified
    through linkage to the Swedish National Death Registry., Cause of death was determined
    by International Classification of Diseases codes through linkage to the Cause
    of Death Registry at the National Bureau of Health and Welfare., Cox proportional
    hazard models with time since diagnosis in months as the time scale were used
    to calculate hazard ratios and 95 % confidence intervals for death from breast
    cancer., 'Participants contributed person-time from the date of breast cancer
    diagnosis until death from breast cancer, death from another cause or end of follow-up
    on December 31, 2009.', Baseline diet was considered the exposure in all analyses
    except when dietary change was examined., Selenium intake was categorized in quartiles
    with the lowest quartile as the reference group., Total caloric intake and age
    at diagnosis were included in all models., 'Education level, marital status, menopausal
    status at diagnosis, body mass index, and calendar year of diagnosis were considered
    potential confounders in all multivariable models.', 'Parity, age at first birth,
    oral contraceptive use, postmenopausal hormone use, height, and family history
    of breast cancer were not observed to be confounders and were not included in
    the final models.', 'Multivariable models were adjusted for the following clinical
    characteristics: stage, grade of tumor, radiation treatment, and chemotherapy/hormonal
    therapy.', We also adjusted for physical activity among women who completed the
    1997 questionnaire., Tests for linear trend were performed by assigning the median
    value of each quartile to each participant in that group., We conducted sensitivity
    analyses excluding women with stage IV cancer and excluding those who reported
    taking a supplement containing selenium on the 1997 FFQ., 'We examined whether
    the association between selenium and breast cancer survival differed by hormone
    receptor status, disease stage at diagnosis, smoking status, age, BMI, and other
    antioxidant micronutrients with a likelihood ratio test comparing the model with
    the cross-product term between selenium and each potential effect modifier to
    the model with main effects only.', All tests of statistical significance were
    two-sided and statistical analyses were performed using SAS Version 9.2., 'During
    28,172 person-years of follow-up contributed by 3,146 breast cancer cases, there
    were 964 deaths with 416 deaths from breast cancer.', The mean age at diagnosis
    was 65 years and the median follow-up time was 9.0 years., Dietary assessment
    occurred a median of 10.6 years before breast cancer diagnosis., "Mean selenium
    intake was 24.7 \u03BCg/day.", 'The main sources of dietary selenium in the study
    population were fish, dairy products, meat, eggs, and hard bread.', 'Women in
    the highest quartile of selenium intake were more likely to have a post-secondary
    education, to use postmenopausal hormones, consumed more alcohol than women in
    the lowest quartile of selenium intake, and were less likely to have been diagnosed
    with stage III or IV breast cancer.', "Characteristics of 3,146 women with invasive
    breast cancer in the Swedish Mammography Cohort by quartiles of dietary selenium
    intakea  \n\n\n\n\n\nSelenium intake was inversely associated with breast cancer
    mortality.", Women in the highest quartile of selenium intake had a covariate-adjusted
    HR of death from breast cancer of 0.64 compared with those in the lowest quartile.,
  Adjustment for clinical characteristics and treatment did not materially alter the
    results., 'In a sensitivity analysis that excluded women with stage IV breast
    cancer, results were not materially different than the main analysis.', We also
    adjusted for physical activity among women who completed the 1997 questionnaire
    and saw no change in the effect estimates., 'Results were similar but slightly
    attenuated when death from any cause was the outcome, and when death from a cause
    other than breast cancer was considered the outcome, the covariate and clinical
    adjusted trend was borderline significant.', The association between selenium
    intake and non-breast deaths appeared to be driven by deaths from other cancers
    as when these deaths were excluded the association was attenuated and the trend
    was not significant., "Hazard ratios and 95 % confidence intervals of breast cancer

    of foods that were the main sources of dietary selenium in our population to explore
    if any of these foods could explain the association between selenium and breast
    cancer\u2013specific mortality.", "There was a non-significant inverse association
    between fish consumption and breast cancer\u2013specific mortality.", "Women consuming
    five or more servings of fish per week had a covariate and clinical characteristics\u2013adjusted
    HR of 0.57 compared with those consuming less than one serving per week; however,
    adjustment for selenium attenuated these results while selenium remained significantly
    inversely associated with breast cancer mortality in this model.", "In addition,
    adjustment for dietary marine \u03C9-3 fatty acids did not alter the association.",
  "Other sources of selenium, including milk, cheese, meat, eggs, and hard bread,
    as well as protein, were not significantly associated with breast cancer\u2013specific
    mortality and selenium was still significantly associated with mortality following
    adjustment for these foods and nutrients.", "No heterogeneity in the associations
    between selenium and breast cancer\u2013specific mortality was observed by the
    hormone receptor status of the tumor or by disease stage at diagnosis.", The association
    between selenium and breast cancer death did not vary according to intake of other

  'In the subset of 1,761 women who reported their smoking habits on the 1997 questionnaire,
    there was the suggestion of a stronger inverse association between selenium intake
    and breast cancer mortality among women who had ever smoked.', "Among ever smokers,
    those in the highest quartile of selenium intake had a covariate-adjusted HR of
    0.31 and a covariate and clinical characteristics\u2013adjusted HR of 0.34 compared
    with women in the lowest quartile.", The corresponding covariate-adjusted HR for
    women who had never smoked was 0.72., 'However, the P value for heterogeneity
    was not significant.', There was no evidence of heterogeneity by age or BMI.,
  We compared dietary selenium intake among women who completed both the 1987 and
    1997 FFQs., Up to 84.3 % of women completing the 1997 FFQ remained in the same
    or adjacent quartile of selenium intake compared with the 1987 FFQ., 'Among the
    subset of women who were diagnosed with breast cancer from 1987 to 1996 and completed
    a FFQ in 1997 following breast cancer diagnosis, up to 85.3 % of these women remained
    in the same or adjacent quartile of selenium intake following breast cancer diagnosis.',
  'However, numbers were too small to examine the association between post-diagnosis
    selenium intake and survival in this group.', 'In addition, 10.0 % of these 717
    women reported the use of a supplement containing selenium in 1997 compared with
    11.2 % among all women who completed both FFQs.', In a sensitivity analysis that
    excluded women who reported taking a supplement containing selenium in 1997 results
    were not materially different than the main analysis., "In this prospective study
    among 3,146 women with invasive breast cancer, dietary selenium intake was inversely
    associated with breast cancer\u2013specific and overall mortality.", This association
    persisted after adjustment for intake of foods with high selenium content indicating
    that selenium intake itself was the most likely explanation for the observed inverse
    association., 'In addition, there was the suggestion that the inverse association
    was stronger among women who were ever smokers and thus exposed to higher levels
    of oxidative stress.', The epidemiologic data regarding the relation between selenium
    and survival among women with breast cancer are sparse., 'To our knowledge, only
    two studies have examined the association between selenium intake and mortality
    following breast cancer diagnosis.', Holmes et al., "examined post-diagnosis intake
    of selenium among 1,982 women with invasive breast cancer in the Nurses\u2019
    Health Study and reported a non-significant inverse association with all-cause
    mortality .", Hazard ratios ;1.0 were observed for the second through fifth quintiles
    compared with the first quintile with the lowest point estimate for the third
    quintile., "In contrast, among 2,939 women with breast cancer enrolled in the
    Women\u2019s Healthy Eating and Living Study, a u-shaped association was observed
    with a non-significant positive association reported between selenium intakes
    &gt;400 \u03BCg and all-cause mortality and a non-significant positive association
    with selenium intake &lt;55 \u03BCg, using women with adequate intake as the reference
    group .", 'In Sweden, selenium levels in soil are naturally low and our population
    had much lower selenium intake than these two American study populations.', "The
    highest selenium quartile in our population had selenium levels of 27.7 \u03BCg/day
    or higher corresponding to the lowest category in the WHEL Study.", Holmes et
    al., "did not report the range of selenium intake among their breast cancer cases,
    but previous analyses in the NHS using toenail selenium levels have implied that
    the difference in selenium levels between the highest and lowest quintiles was
    at least 100 \u03BCg/day , which is higher than the range of values observed in
    our population.", "Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
    in the U.S. have reported mean serum selenium levels of 134.7 \u03BCg/L among
    women \u226540 years, whereas among a population of Swedish women with a median
    age of 38 years, median serum selenium levels were 70 \u03BCg/L .", 'It is possible
    that in populations with adequately high levels of selenium intake, the protective
    effect of selenium may not be apparent .', Previous investigations of intake of
    antioxidants and cancer prevention have resulted in discordant results between
    observational studies and randomized nutritional interventional trials., 'Some
    observational data suggest that higher intake of antioxidants reduces risk of
    certain cancers , while intervention trials have observed an increased risk of
    lung cancer with beta-carotene supplement intake  and with a combination of beta-carotene
    and vitamin A , and an increased risk of prostate cancer with vitamin E supplement
    intake .', Our results are consistent with two of three intervention trials that
    have examined selenium supplementation., "The Nutritional Prevention of Cancer
    trial randomized patients with a history of basal cell or squamous cell carcinomas
    who were living in low selenium areas of the U.S. to 200 \u03BCg/day of selenium
    or placebo.", 'While selenium supplementation did not reduce the risk of basal
    cell or squamous cell carcinomas, a significant reduction in total cancer mortality
    and a non-significant reduction in all-cause mortality were observed .', 'In the
    Nutritional Intervention Trial in Linxian, China, where intake of several micronutrients
    is low, adults were randomized to four different combinations of nutrients including
    a supplement containing beta-carotene, vitamin E, and selenium.', 'A reduction
    in total mortality was observed in those receiving the beta-carotene, vitamin
    E, and selenium supplement but not among those receiving the other supplements
    or placebo .', 'In contrast, the SELECT trial, which randomized U.S. and Canadian
    men to four groups, reported no association between selenium supplementation either
    alone or with vitamin E and all-cause deaths, a secondary study endpoint .', Differences
    in baseline selenium plasma levels may potentially explain the differing results
    between the NPC and Linxian trial and SELECT., 'Participants in the NPC trial
    were recruited from low selenium areas in the Eastern U.S., and baseline mean
    plasma selenium level of participants was 115.1 ng/mL .', "Baseline mean serum
    selenium concentration in a subset of the Linxian cohort was 73 \u03BCg/L , while
    median baseline serum selenium levels ranged from 135.0 to 137.6 \u03BCg/L for
    the four groups in SELECT .", 'In addition, in a follow-up report on the NPC trial,
    selenium supplementation reduced prostate cancer incidence only among participants
    in the bottom two tertiles of baseline plasma selenium further supporting a threshold
    effect for the benefits of selenium .', The mechanisms through which selenium
    might influence cancer development and progression are not clear but may involve
    its incorporation into selenoproteins., The selenoprotein glutathione peroxidase
    has antioxidant activities that may help prevent cellular damage from free radicals.,
  Baliga et al., reported that GPx-1 attenuated UV-induced micronuclei formation most
    likely through either the prevention or repair of DNA damage ., Mouse models have
    also demonstrated that higher selenium intake may increase survival time and age
    at tumor onset as well as decrease tumor incidence ., "The optimal activity of
    GPx is suggested to be reached at selenium intakes of 55\u201375 \u03BCg/day  which
    is consistent with a threshold effect above which intake of selenium may not appear
    to influence mortality or disease risk.", 'In contrast, at low levels of selenium
    intake such as those observed in our population, the effect of selenium through
    its antioxidant activities may be most evident.', We observed a stronger inverse
    association between selenium intake and breast cancer mortality among women who
    were current or former smokers., Cigarette smokers are subject to higher levels
    of oxidative stress as smoking is associated with reactive oxygen species production
    ., 'Although the mechanisms underlying the interaction between selenium and smoking
    are not known, GPx activity has been shown to be lower among smokers  and thus
    increased selenium intake may have a stronger influence on smokers reaching optimal
    GPx activity levels than non-smokers.', Selenium has also been found to decrease
    ROS generation  which may also explain the stronger effect observed among smokers.,
  Selenium levels in foods may vary between geographic regions because of the selenium
    content of the soil where the food was produced., 'Thus, epidemiologic studies
    often prefer to use toenail or plasma selenium levels to reflect body selenium
    status .', A potential limitation of our study is the use of FFQ to assess selenium
    intake including the lack of validation data specifically for selenium intake
    estimated from the FFQ., 'However, a previous study in a population of Swedish
    women reported a significant association between serum selenium levels and fish
    consumption measured from a FFQ .', The FFQ has been previously validated with
    diet records for most foods that were the main contributors to selenium intake
    ., We expect that the errors in dietary assessment of selenium would be random
    and likely cause an attenuation of the true effect not create an artificial effect
    when none existed., 'In addition, the lower levels of selenium in foods in Sweden
    may limit the generalizability of our results as other populations are naturally
    exposed to higher levels of selenium through the food supply.', 'Furthermore,
    while dietary supplement use, including selenium supplementation, was not common
    among our population in 1987, current supplement use in other populations is likely
    higher which may also limit the generalizability of our results.', 'Another limitation
    of our study was for the majority of our participants, we only had a pre-diagnosis
    assessment of diet and thus could not examine diet post-diagnosis during the follow-up
    period.', "While studies among women with breast cancer have indicated that 30\u201340
    % report dietary change following diagnosis, the main changes reported were an
    increase in fruit and vegetable consumption and a decrease in meat consumption
    .", 'However, fruit and vegetables were not primary contributors to selenium intake
    in our population while meat consumption contributed to approximately 11 % of
    dietary selenium intake.', 'In addition, among a cohort of breast cancer patients
    in the U.K., no change in selenium intake pre- to post-diagnosis was observed
    .', 'In our study, up to 85 % of women who completed a FFQ post-diagnosis remained
    in the same or adjacent quartile of selenium intake following diagnosis.', Residual
    or unmeasured confounding by healthy lifestyle characteristics such as physical
    activity or other dietary factors is a possibility., 'However, we adjusted for
    a variety of potential confounders with minimal change in our effect estimates.',
  We also adjusted for physical activity in the subset of breast cancer cases with
    this information and the association did not materially change., Additional adjustment
    for the foods that were the highest contributors to selenium did not materially
    change the effect estimates., 'Finally, we cannot rule out that the results may
    be because of chance.', "To our knowledge, this is the largest study to examine
    the association between dietary selenium intake and mortality with 964 total deaths
    including 416 breast cancer deaths which allowed us the power to not only evaluate
    breast cancer\u2013specific mortality but also whether the association differed
    by tumor hormone receptor status or other potential effect modifiers.", 'Strengths
    also include a prospective population-based cohort design, complete follow-up
    of all cases, long follow-up period, detailed information on diet, and data on
    many important covariates, including clinical and lifestyle characteristics.',
  "In conclusion, we observed that selenium intake before breast cancer diagnosis
    may improve breast cancer\u2013specific survival and overall survival.", These
    findings may be limited to populations with low intakes of selenium., "This work
