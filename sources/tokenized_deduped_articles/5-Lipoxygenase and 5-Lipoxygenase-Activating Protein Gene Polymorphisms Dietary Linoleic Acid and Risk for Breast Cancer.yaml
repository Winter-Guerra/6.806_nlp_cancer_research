[The n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid 5-lipoxygenase pathway has been shown to play
    a role in the carcinogenesis of breast cancer., 'We conducted a population-based
    case-control study among Latina, African-American, and White women from the San
    Francisco Bay area to examine the association of the 5-lipoxygenase gene and 5-lipoxygenase-activating
    protein gene with breast cancer risk.', Three ALOX5AP polymorphisms  and three
    ALOX5 polymorphisms  were genotyped in 802 cases and 888 controls., "We did not
    find significant main effects of ALOX5 and ALOX5AP genotypes on breast cancer
    risk that were consistent across race or ethnicity; however, there was a significant
    interaction between the ALOX5AP \u22124900 A&gt;G polymorphism and dietary linoleic
    acid intake.", 'Among women consuming a diet high in linoleic acid, carrying the
    AA genotype was associated with higher breast cancer risk compared with carrying
    genotypes AG or GG.', "Among women consuming \u226417.4 g/d of linoleic acid,
    ALOX5AP \u22124900 genotype was not associated with breast cancer risk.", These
    results support a role for n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids in breast carcinogenesis
    and suggest that epidemiologic studies on dietary fat and breast cancer should
    take into account genetic predisposition related to n-6 polyunsaturated fatty
    acid metabolism., ":2748\u201354)"]
