[Cd bioaccumulation pattern was investigated in Mediterranean spider crab collected
    from the northern Adriatic Sea., Specimens were caught in the framework of a monitoring
    plan in order to quantify the Cd distribution into different organs and tissues
    of crab., 'For this purpose, Cd level was studied in appendages, cephalothorax,
    abdomen as well as gonads.', Cd concentrations were found largely below the Maximum
    Level established at the European Union level for muscle from crab appendages
    and approximately amounted to 2% of the EU ML., 'The higher Cd concentrations
    were found in organs and tissues included in crab body such as abdomen, chephalotorax
    and gonads with respect to appendages.', Chephalotorax showed the highest metal
    concentration., The possible differences in Cd bioaccumulation rate among crab
    organs and tissues were also investigated applying a parametric linear regression.,
  A major Cd bioaccumulation rate was revealed in chephalotorax with respect to other
    analyzed organs and tissues., 'Furthermore, the evaluation of health risk related
    to human consumption of the Mediterranean spider crab has been studied for median
    of total population, median and 95th percentile of consumers of Italy.', 'The
    observed results highlighted that the consumption of organs and tissues included
    in crab body such as abdomen, gonads and, in particular, chephalotorax substantially
    increased the Cd intake reaching also alarming Estimated Weekly Intake values
    especially for median and 95th percentile of Italian consumers.']
