[Dietary factors other than the traditional nutrients are found in the so-called functional
    foods., They are becoming increasingly recognized as potentially important for
    maintaining good health., Soybeans are rich in such factors thought to help prevent
    certain chronic diseases., 'Soy protein isolate is one of the three major proteins
    used in infant formulas sold in the United States, with casein and whey proteins
    being the others.', We have been studying the health effects of these proteins.,
  "Safety concerns have developed over the consumption of soy-based infant formula,
    partly because of the high circulating levels of the total isoflavones during
    \u201Ccritical periods of infant development.\u201D There is a paucity of data
    on developmental, physiological, neurophysiological, behavioral, metabolic, or
    molecular effects of soy phytochemicals in humans, especially during pregnancy
    and infancy.", 'We have studied the effects of CAS, SPI, and WPH in short-term,
    long-term, and multigenerational studies in rats.', 'Aside from minor differences
    in body weight gain profiles, CAS-, SPI-or WPH-fed rats did not differ in development,
    organ weights, in vitro hepatic metabolism of testosterone, or reproductive performance.',
  'However, some endocrine-related functions differed between rats fed these proteins.',
  'We found that SPI accelerated puberty in female rats and WPH delayed puberty in
    males and females, as compared with CAS.', Gender differences were also found
    in gonadectomy-induced steroid responses., "Male rats had normal serum T levels,
    but female rats fed SPI had reduced serum 17\u03B2-estradiol concentrations and
    a blunted 17\u03B2-estradiol response to ovariectomy, as compared to rats fed
    CAS or WHP.", 'Female rats fed SPI or WHP or treated with genistein had reduced
    incidence of chemically induced mammary cancers compared to CAS controls, with
    WHP reducing tumor incidence by as much as 50%, findings that replicate previous
    results from our laboratory.', 'Together, these results suggest gender-specific
    differences in development and certain endocrine responses among rats fed diets
    composed of a single protein source such as those used in infant formulas.', 'Whether
    similar developmental effects occur in human infants is unknown, but unlikely
    because most infants do not consume such diets throughout life as these rats did,
    and no such effects have been reported in millions of American infants fed infant
    formula containing these proteins.', 'The long-term health consequence implications
    of early diet exposure to SPI and WPH, such as reduced breast cancer incidence,
    are likely to be very positive.']
