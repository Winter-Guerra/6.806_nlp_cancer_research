['The health benefits associated with a diet rich in fruit and vegetables include
    reduction of the risk of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes
    and cancer, that are becoming prevalent in the aging human population.', 'Triterpenoids,
    polycyclic compounds derived from the linear hydrocarbon squalene, are widely
    distributed in edible and medicinal plants and are an integral part of the human
    diet.', 'As an important group of phytochemicals that exert numerous biological
    effects and display various pharmacological activities, triterpenoids are being
    evaluated for use in new functional foods, drugs, cosmetics and healthcare products.',
  Screening plant material in the search for triterpenoid-rich plant tissues has identified
    fruit peel and especially fruit cuticular waxes as promising and highly available
    sources., 'The chemical composition, abundance and biological activities of triterpenoids
    occurring in cuticular waxes of some economically important fruits, like apple,
    grape berry, olive, tomato and others, are described in this review.', 'The need
    for environmentally valuable and potentially profitable technologies for the recovery,
    recycling and upgrading of residues from fruit processing is also discussed.',
  'Through the ages, folk medicine has established the value of certain foods in human
    health maintenance.', There is now mounting evidence that the healthiest diets
    are those loaded with plant foods., 'The health benefits ascribed to diets rich
    in fruit and vegetables include prevention, or at least reduction of the risk
    of chronic diseases occurring in the aging human population, such as cardiovascular
    disease, diabetes and cancer.', 'In primary prevention, a diet rich in plant-derived
    food is the preferred treatment option for early type-2 diabetes and hypercholesterolemia.',
  "Such a diet can also lower the blood pressure, reduce the risk of heart disease
    and stroke, prevent some gastrointestinal problems like diverticulosis, and lower
    the risk of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, cataracts and macular degeneration of the
    eye, as well as other age-related functional declines.", "There is considerable
    interest in bioactive compounds present in edible plants and thus in \u201Cletting
    your food be your medicine\u201D, as recommended by Hippocrates.", 'Bioactive
    plant constituents that are being actively studied for their health enhancing
    potential include flavonoids, phenolic acids, carotenoids, tocopherols, alkaloids,
    lignans, tannins, salicylates and glucosinolates, plus another important class
    of secondary metabolites, the triterpenoids.', 'Formed by the cyclization of the
    linear squalene molecule, these tetra- or pentacyclic compounds are distinguished
    by their wide structural diversity.', 'Moreover, they are found in plants not
    only in a free form, but also as esters and glycoside conjugates called saponins.',
  'All forms of triterpenoids are widely distributed in edible and medicinal plants,
    and consequently, they are an integral part of the human diet.', 'Triterpenoids
    have been shown to possess numerous biological activities and display various
    pharmacological effects such as antiinflammatory, antiulcer, antibacterial, antiviral,
    hepatoprotective, immunomodulatory, hypolipidemic and cholesterol-lowering, antiatherosclerotic,
    wound-healing, anticoagulant and anticarcinogenic properties, combined with relatively
    low toxicity.', The multifunctionality of triterpenoids makes them promising multi-targeting
    agents in the treatment of certain cancers and inflammatory diseases., "Due to
    their ability to act at various stages in the process of carcinogenesis, namely
    to block NF-\u03BAB activation, induce apoptosis and inhibit proliferation, invasion,
    metastasis and angiogenesis, these compounds may be considered for use in both
    chemoprevention and chemotherapy of cancer.", 'Triterpenoids in their free and
    esterified forms are compounds with low polarity, and are therefore found in abundance
    in such plant parts as surface cuticle waxes and stem bark.', 'Screens of various
    plant tissues to identify those that are rich in triterpenoids, point to fruit
    peels as a promising and highly available source material.', The surfaces of aerial
    parts of all terrestrial plants are covered with a hydrophobic layer called a
    cuticle., 'The cuticle forms a protective coating to prevent desiccation of the
    plant organs due to uncontrolled non-stomatal water loss, as well as the loss
    of organic and inorganic compounds by leaching.', 'The cuticle is the first protective
    barrier against abiotic and biotic environmental stresses; it protects the plant
    surfaces against mechanical damage, abrasions, infiltration of xenobiotics and
    potentially harmful irradiance, like UV-B radiation, and it is the first line
    of defense against infection by plant pathogens.', This interface between the
    plant and its environment is relevant for colonization by epiphytic microorganisms
    and host recognition by insects and pathogenic fungi., 'In agriculture, it is
    the target site for sprays including fertilizers, growth regulators, fungicides,
    insecticides and herbicides.', 'The cuticle has two main components, a structural
    matrix called cutin, and wax.', 'Cutin is a polyester-type biopolymer, composed
    mainly of hydroxy- and hydroxyepoxy-fatty acids.', 'Waxes are embedded in the
    cutin and form a continuous layer on its top, so that intracuticular and epicuticular
    wax layers can be distinguished.', 'Waxes extracted from diverse plant species
    consist of homologous series of very-long-chain aliphatics, i.e.', 'fatty acids,
    aldehydes, primary and secondary alcohols, ketones, alkanes and alkyl esters.',
  'Triterpenoids, tocopherols or aromatic compounds may also be present in trace amounts
    in some species, while dominating the mixture in others.', It has been reported
    that triterpenoids are located almost exclusively in the intracuticular wax compartment.,
  'The chemical composition of cuticular waxes shows great variability, not only among
    different plant species, but also between different organs of an individual plant,
    and is affected by the stage of plant development, its geographic location and
    the local environmental conditions.', The cuticular wax layer forms an interactive
    flexible interface between the plant and its environment., 'Thus, the chemical
    composition of these waxes influences the morphology, arrangement and microstructure
    of the plant surface, which determines the relative adhesion of water, pesticides,
    fungal spores, and other airborne deposits.', This means that cuticular waxes
    are responsible for the wettability and permeability properties of the cuticle.,
  'On the other hand, the thickness and texture of the cuticular wax can be affected
    by environmental factors such as relative humidity, soil moisture, sunlight and
    temperature.', 'Thus, external conditions can significantly influence the amount
    and composition of cuticular wax, which can have an impact on the vitality of
    leaves and the quality of the fruits.', 'In the case of fleshy fruits, in particular,
    the cuticle is an important factor contributing to shelf life and post-harvest
    storability.', Variation in the cuticle composition may underlie differences in
    fruit resistance to desiccation and microbial infection., 'The composition of
    the cuticle has been associated with the incidence and severity of fungal disease,
    particularly the presence of biologically active compounds which can reduce germination
    of conidia or inhibit germ tube growth of various fungi.', 'Compared with plant
    vegetative organs, especially leaves, far less information is available regarding
    the triterpenoid content of fruit cuticular waxes.', 'Data concerning the triterpenoids
    contained in fruit cuticular waxes and their possible impact on the health benefits
    associated with fruit consumption, and the usefulness of the fruit peel as a source
    of such compounds, are presented in this review.', "Although not strictly botanical
    terms, \u201Cpeel\u201D and sometimes \u201Cskin\u201D are used to denote the
    outer fruit layers, composed of the cuticle and multiple cell types, including
    epidermis, collenchyma, and sometimes even parenchyma, depending on how the peels
    are removed.", "The term \u201Cflesh\u201D refers to the pericarp material from
    which the peel has been removed; this tissue is predominantly composed of parenchyma
    and collenchyma.", 'Among all edible fruits, apples var.', domestica Borkh.),
  have one of the longest history of being significant part of the human diet and
    they also have proven medicinal properties., "The proverb \u201Can apple a day
    keeps the doctor away\u201D has been validated by numerous observations.", Current
    annual global apple production is approximately 70 million tonnes., 'The consumption
    of apples has been linked to the prevention of various chronic diseases and is
    believed to reduce the incidence of lung cancer, cardiovascular disease, symptoms
    of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and the risk of thrombotic stroke.',
  'Apple peel exhibits more potent antioxidant and antiproliferative activity than
    apple flesh, which suggests that the peel contains the majority of the bioactive
    phytochemicals.', 'Epicuticular waxes of apples were studied as early as 1920,
    and ursolic acid was one of the first reported components.', Apple peel has since
    been frequently recommended as a source of ursolic acid that may be utilized for
    various purposes., 'Several methods have been devised for the isolation of this
    compound from apple, including extraction of fresh homogenized peels with ethyl
    acetate, extraction of dried peel with chloroform, and accelerated solvent extraction
    of dried peel with ethyl acetate.', 'Besides various techniques of adsorption
    chromatography and HPLC, high speed counter-current chromatography has also been
    used to purify this compound.', 'The occurrence of ursolic acid in apple peels
    is well documented, but there is a growing list of other triterpenoids that are
    also present in apple fruit cuticular wax and have yet to be fully investigated.',
  Ma et al., 'reported the isolation of six triterpenoid compounds with ursane and
    oleanane skeletons in an ethyl acetate extract of the peel of apples purchased
    from a supermarket in Beijing, China.', "The occurrence of oleanolic acid in the
    Holsteiner Cox variety was described by Ellgardt, and \u03B2-sitosterol was found
    by Verardo et al.", 'in the cultivars Florina, Golden B and Ozark Gold.', "Thirteen
    triterpenoids were isolated and identified by He and Liu in the peel of Red Delicious

    acid\n\nApples are a very good example of how the quantity and composition of
    epicuticular wax can vary between cultivars.", 'For example, among twelve cultivars
    tested, the triterpenoid content ranged from 32 % of cuticular wax extract obtained
    from Royal Gala apples to almost 70 % in Pure Gold fruit.', 'The amounts of ursolic
    acid, oleanolic acid and uvaol were higher by 17, 15 and 29 %, respectively, in
    cuticular wax of Holsteiner Cox apples originating from integrated production
    compared with those produced organically, which indicates that the method of cultivation
    can influence the apple peel composition.', 'The triterpenoid content of apple
    peel can also be significantly affected by post-harvest conditions including cold
    storage of fruit, as was revealed by studies on metabolomic changes associated
    with oxidation during the development of superficial scald symptoms.', 'In turn,
    cuticular wax composition can influence the quality of fruits during storage and
    their shelf life.', 'For example, Golden Delicious apples lose water more rapidly
    than other cultivars in storage, which is commonly thought to be due to the smaller
    wax mass.', 'At the same time, the cuticular wax of these apples contains the
    highest proportion of triterpenoids, which might explain the poor water retention
    of this cultivar, since a high level of triterpenoids in cuticular wax is not
    positively correlated with water impermeability.', 'The composition of the cuticular
    wax of apples has also been studied with regard to its possible relevance in the
    avoidance of fruit damage caused by insects and pathogens such as Peltaster fructicola
    and Leptodontidium elatius, although the relative proportions of triterpenoids
    were not found to be related to the severity of sooty blotch disease caused by
    these fungi.', 'Apple peels are a waste product of juice and canned fruit production,
    and their utilization to generate a value-added food ingredient can be economically
    beneficial.', 'However, there have been no studies on the consequences of the
    commercial practice of waxing apples on the occurrence of triterpenoids in apple
    peel.', 'Prior to packaging of apple fruits, they are washed by scrubbing the
    surface to remove field dust and chemical residues, which removes approximately
    50 % of the natural wax coating.', 'To replace the original protective layer,
    supplementary waxes are applied to the surface of apples.', 'However, as triterpenoids
    are most likely to be localized in the deeper layers of plant cuticular waxes,
    i.e.', 'intracuticular wax substructure, it is possible that this treatment does
    not remove all these compounds from the peel of packed and waxed apples sold in
    supermarkets.', 'A diet enriched in apples has been associated with the reduced
    incidence of many chronic diseases, including lung cancer.', The antitumor activity
    of triterpenoids isolated from apple peel has been investigated with a variety
    of tests., "Ursolic acid and 2\u03B1-hydroxyursolic acid exhibited in vitro growth
    inhibitory activity against four tumor cell lines, HL-60, BGC, Bel-7402, and HeLa,
    with ED50 values ranging from 45 to 72 \u03BCg/ml.", 'Moreover, ursolic acid can
    serve as a precursor of more potent cytotoxic derivatives, such as the 3-amino
    and 28-aminoalkyl compounds, the former of which was shown to be 20-times more
    potent than the parent compound.', 'Most of the triterpenoids, including their
    p-coumaryloxy-esters, isolated from apple peel of the Red Delicious variety by
    He and Liu, showed potent antiproliferative activities against human cell lines
    of HepG2 liver cancer, MCF-7 breast cancer and Caco-2 colon cancer.', Yamaguchi
    et al., 'reported a slight harmful effect of ursolic acid isolated from apple
    peel of the Fuji variety on normal mouse embryo cells, which contrast with its
    efficacy in suppressing the growth of highly metastatic tumorigenic cells.', "However,
    higher concentrations of ursolic acid can also be harmful to healthy cells: a
    concentration of 20 \u03BCM suppressed the growth of more than 90 % of tumorigenic
    cells, but it also affected about 60 % of normal cells.", 'Ursolic acid itself
    is ubiquitous in medicinal and edible plants, and it has attracted attention due
    to its diverse pharmacological properties including antitumorigenic effects exerted
    by inhibition of the STAT3 pathway.', "This compound was shown to inhibit NF-\u03BAB
    activation induced by carcinogenic agents through suppression of I\u03BAB\u03B1
    kinase and p65 phosphorylation, and it also suppressed TNF-induced expression
    of cyclin D1, cyclooxygenase 2 and matrix metalloproteinase 9, which are involved
    in the initiation, promotion and metastasis of tumors.", 'Grapevine, which is
    native to southern Europe and Western Asia, is cultivated also on other continents,
    and its fruit is highly valued for its great economic importance and many health
    benefits.', 'In the context of the Mediterranean dietary tradition, grape consumption
    is linked to reduction of the incidence of chronic illnesses, such as cancer,
    cardiovascular diseases, ischemic stroke, neurodegenerative disorders and aging.',
  'Grapevine products are well known for their antioxidant content, and therefore,
    grape extracts are also widely used in various cosmetic formulas.', 'Many studies
    have shown that active components, including polyphenols, resveratrol, hydroxytyrosol
    and recently melatonin, may contribute to the health benefits associated with
    regular consumption of grape products.', 'However, relatively few studies have
    focused on the presence and health promoting properties of triterpenoids from
    grape berries.', "Some preliminary investigations of the composition of grape
    berry wax were carried out as early as 1892, and by 1938, oleanolic acid and \u03B2-sitosterol
    had been identified.", Oleanolic acid was the main constituent of chloroform extracts
    of cuticular waxes from the fruits of the sultana vine as well as those of several
    American Vitis species and hybrids., 'The amount of oleanolic acid in wax extract
    of young and mature sultana vine fruits ranged from 45 to 65 %, respectively,
    and accounted for 50 % of the total wax extract obtained from dried grapes.',
  The occurrence of remarkable amounts of oleanolic acid in grape berry wax was confirmed
    in many subsequent studies performed on various grape cultivars., "This compound
    was reported to constitute 50\u201380 % of the total weight of wax extracts obtained
    from fruits of several Japanese grape varieties at the harvest stage, and it was
    the main component of grape berry cuticular waxes of three clones of Pinot noir
    at all stages of fruit development.", 'Furthermore, a comparison of twelve grape
    varieties revealed significant variation in the oleanolic acid content, ranging
    from 31 to 162 mg/kg of fresh berry mass calculated for fruit wax, or from 157
    to 239 mg/kg of fresh berry mass when calculated for whole fruit skins.', 'Besides
    oleanolic acid, other triterpenoids have been identified in grape berry cuticular
    wax, namely oleanolic aldehyde, erythrodiol and a group of phytosterols and their
    derivatives.', "The phytosterols \u03B2-sitosterol, campesterol and stigmasterol
    were detected in chloroform extracts of the dried skin of berries obtained from
    fourteen grape varieties of the Piedmont region.", 'Subsequently, lanosterol was
    identified in Folch mixture extracts from lyophilised skins of Chardonnay grape
    berries from Burgundy.', 'The level of phytosterols exhibited a characteristic
    pattern of fluctuation: increasing at peak maturity and decreasing during the
    last stage of ripening.', "The predominant steroid compound in the grape berry
    cuticular wax was \u03B2-sitosterol, accounting for 0.1 % of dry berry skin and
    representing 86\u201389 % of the total detected phytosterols.", "The levels of
    stigmasterol and campesterol were estimated at 85 and 43 \u03BCg/g of dry weight,
    respectively, while lanosterol was found in much lower amounts.", "\u03B2-Sitosterol
    and its monoglycosidic derivative, \u03B2-sitosterol-3-O-\u03B2-D-glucoside were
    identified by liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry in ethyl acetate extracts
    of berry skins of grapes from the Eger and Alf\xF6ld regions, with amounts ranging
    among varieties from 12 to 73 mg/kg of fresh berry mass for \u03B2-sitosterol,
    and 2\u201313 mg/kg of fresh berry mass for its monoglucoside.", "In addition
    to \u03B2-sitosterol-3-O-\u03B2\u2013D-glucoside, another steroid derivative,
    \u03B2-sitosterol-6\u2032-linolenoyl-3-O-\u03B2-D-glucopyranoside was found in
    methanol extracts of blended skins of Cabernet Sauvignon grape berries harvested
    from Michigan State University Horticulture farm.", "Studies examining Thompson
    seedless raisins and grape pomace from the red Sicilian cultivar Nerello Mascalese,
    identified the compounds betulin, betulinic acid, lupeol, oleanolic acid acetate
    and \u03B2-sitosterol glucoside peracetate, which expanded the list of triterpenoids
    found in grape berry cuticular waxes.", "Structures of some triterpenoids occurring

    grape berry cuticle is characterized by a high content of waxes and a high degree
    of molecular order.", 'Oleanolic acid, although highly abundant in this layer
    appears not to contribute to the ordered crystalline structure of the cuticle.',
  'A molecular model of the spatial arrangement of oleanolic acid and the main aliphatic
    compound, n-hexacosanol, has been proposed to explain the organization of the
    grape berry cuticle.', Oleanolic acid can form a dimer via hydrogen bond interactions
    between the hydroxyl group of one molecule and the carboxyl group of a second
    molecule., 'The remaining functional groups may interact with complementary groups
    of other molecules, including aliphatic alcohols, forming a tri-dimentional arrangement.',
  'The ultrastructure and chemical composition of grape cuticular waxes may also play
    an important role in the resistance of grape berries to Botrytis cinerea, although
    a direct relationship between the triterpenoid content and susceptibility to bunch
    rot disease caused by this pathogen has yet to be confirmed.', The high abundance
    of oleanolic acid in grape berry cuticular wax can contribute to health benefits
    ascribed to grape consumption., 'Like its isomer ursolic acid, oleanolic acid
    is known to have numerous pharmacological properties including anticancer, anti-inflammatory,
    antidiabetogenic, antimicrobial, hepato- and cardioprotective, anti-HIV and anti-multiple
    sclerosis effects.', "Oleanolic acid isolated from Cabernet Sauvignon grape skin
    was shown to be capable of in vitro regulation of insulin secretion, significantly
    stimulating insulin production at concentrations ranging from 6 to 50 \u03BCg/ml,
    in a dose-dependent manner, similarly to glucose.", Oleanolic aldehyde was also
    able to influence insulin secretion in vitro., "Furthermore, oleanolic acid applied
    to cells at a concentration of 100 \u03BCg/ml inhibited COX-2 enzyme activity
    by 10 %.", These findings suggest that the consumption of whole grape berries
    may help to reduce the incidence of type-2 diabetes and inflammation., 'In China,
    V. vinifera berries called suosuo grapes, produced in the Turpan, Shanshan and
    Hetian regions of Xinjiang, have been used in Uighur folk medicine for the prevention
    and treatment of liver disorders.', 'In traditional medicine, these grapes have
    also been used to treat diarrhea, hepatitis and stomach aches.', 'The grape berry
    triterpenoid fraction, containing mainly oleanolic acid, exhibited protective
    effects against immunological liver damage in vitro.', This hepatoprotective activity
    was later confirmed by in vivo experiments in mice., 'Oleanolic acid and oleanolic
    aldehyde obtained from Thompson seedless raisins displayed significant antimicrobial
    activity against Streptococcus mutans and Porphyromonas gingivalis, two oral pathogens
    most commonly associated with human dental carries and periodontal diseases.',
  "The growth of these pathogens was also inhibited by other triterpenoid compounds
    occurring in raisins, such as betulin, betulinic acid, \u03B2-sitosterol and \u03B2-sitosterol
    glucoside.", 'The potential benefits to oral health and disease prevention due
    to the presence of antimicrobial triterpenoids, means that raisins may represent
    a healthy alternative to widely consumed sugary snack foods.', "Moreover, \u03B2-sitosterol
    and its glucoside possess a variety of beneficial properties and were shown to
    have serum cholesterol lowering, cancer preventative, antimutagenic and anti-inflammatory
    activities.", 'Lupeol, another triterpene compound isolated from grape pomace,
    is also known for its significant pharmacological properties, including anticancer,
    antiprotozoal, chemopreventive and anti-inflammatory activities.', 'Numerous health
    benefits, including protection against heart disease, are ascribed to the moderate
    consumption of wine, one of the most popular grape berry products.', A worldwide
    monitoring system for cardiovascular diseases organized by the World Health Organization
    showed that the mortality rate from coronary disease is much lower in France than
    in other industrialized countries despite similar consumption of saturated fats.,
  'This phenomenon, called the French paradox, has mostly been explained by the high
    wine intake in France, and is usually linked to the cardioprotective properties
    of phenolics.', There have been few studies examining triterpenoid compounds occurring
    in wine., 'The triterpene composition of five red wines, i.e.', "Bordeaux Graves
    2000, Bordeaux Haut m\xE9doc 1998, Bordeaux Pessac L\xE9ognan 1999, Burgundy 1996

    acid was found only in Burgundy 1996 and Bordeaux Graves 2000.", 'Although the
    identification of triterpenoids occurring in wine is very interesting, this study
    also underlined the fact that some of these compounds could come from the oak
    wood barrels used during wine maturation.', 'This was recently confirmed by the
    detection in wine of two novel compounds, quercotriterpenoside I and II: oleanane-type
    triterpenes substituted with galloyl and glucosyl residues that originate from
    oak barrels.', 'Grape pomace, which is estimated to represent 13 % of the grape
    by weight, is a significant by-product of the process of wine-making and a promising
    source of useful compounds: not only polyphenols, but also biologically active
    triterpenoids.', "For example, a freeze-dried grape pomace macerate of red grape
    Nerello Mascalese was defatted with n-hexane and extracted with ethyl acetate
    to obtain oleanolic acid, lupeol and \u03B2-sitosterol 3-O-glucoside with yields
    of 0.1575 %, 0.0085 % and 0.0249 % of pomace dry weight, respectively.", Olive
    is a fruit of major agricultural importance in the Mediterranean region., 'Olive
    tree cultivation started 6,000 years ago and thus the olive is the oldest cultivated
    tree.', 'Olive oil, one of the basic components of the traditional Mediterranean
    diet, has become increasingly popular due to its beneficial nutritional and medicinal
    properties, including reduction of the risk of coronary heart disease and atherosclerosis,
    the prevention of several types of cancer and modification of the immune and inflammatory
    responses.', 'However, while the beneficial effects of the monounsaturated fatty
    acids and phenols in olive oil are well recognized, much less attention has been
    paid to other compounds, including triterpenoids.', 'The presence of the pentacyclic
    triterpene acids, maslinic and oleanolic, in olive fruits has long been known.',
  'These compounds were identified as the major components of the chloroform-soluble
    waxes of olive fruits of the Italian cultivar Coratina collected in Pescara, accounting
    for 26 and 38 % of the total wax of green mature and black ripe olives, respectively.',
  'This study also revealed differences between green and black olives in the content
    of the dihydroxy alcohols, erythrodiol and uvaol, which were present in substantial
    amounts in the wax of green olives, but only in traces in that of black olives.',
  "In addition, small amounts of betulinic and ursolic acids, \u03B1- and \u03B2-amyrins,
    as well as phytosterols, mainly \u03B2-sitosterol and stigmasterol, were detected.",
  'Significant amounts of triterpene acids in olive cuticular waxes were also reported
    for cutivars Cipressino, Dritta and Leccino.', The formation of triterpenoids
    throughout fruit ontogeny at 13 distinct stages of development over a period of
    33 weeks after flowering was studied in the olive cultivar Chemlali by Stiti et
    al.., 'Numerous tetra- and pentacyclic triterpenes and sterols were identified
    in a dichloromethane/methanol extract of entire olive fruit, including compounds
    of different carbon skeletons: oleanane, ursane, lupane, taraxane, euphane, baccharane
    and lanostane.', 'At the onset of fruit development, between 12 and 18 weeks after
    flowering, high amounts of the triterpene monols as well as more oxygenated compounds,
    such as triterpene diols and acids, were detected.', "From 21 weeks after flowering,
    when the olive fruit reached its final size and began to turn from green to purple,
    \u03B1- and \u03B2-amyrins were no longer present, whereas the class of methylsterols
    started to be formed.", 'The level of diols decreased to 0.002 % of d.w., while
    the content of triterpene acids reached a peak of almost 0.4 % of d.w..', 'In
    the last stage of fruit development, sterol end products were progressively accumulated
    in larger amounts, while the level of triterpene acids decreased to 0.25 % of
    d.w. During the earlier phases of fruit growth, oleanolic acid was the predominant
    triterpenoid, followed by maslinic acid; whereas in ripe olives, maslinic acid
    was the most abundant.', 'In the 12th week after flowering, oleanolic acid accounted
    for 40 % of total triterpenoids and maslinic acid represented 26 %.', 'Subsequently
    this ratio changed, and by the 30th week after flowering, the level of oleanolic
    acid had decreased to 38 %, while maslinic acid had increased to 61 % of total
    triterpenoids.', 'Thus, the profile and the content of different triterpenoids
    in olive fruit seemed to be significantly influenced by the fruit developmental
    stage.', 'This finding was confirmed for the three main Spanish olive cultivars,
    Picual, Hojiblanca and Arbequina, harvested in La Rinconada.', 'The total triterpene
    content was higher in the unripe fruits and diminished as ripening proceeded,
    with a decrease of 20 % between the green mature and the black ripe stages.',
  'The ratio of maslinic and oleanolic acids was also dependent on the olive cultivar,
    with levels of the former 2.5-fold higher than those of the latter in fruits of
    the Pictual and Hojiblanca cultivars, and four fold higher in Arbequina.', 'A
    study of the distribution of pentacyclic triterpenoids among Arbequina olive fruit
    tissues revealed that maslinic and oleanolic acids were exclusively found in the
    epicarp, which pointed to the cuticular waxes as the main location of these compounds
    in the olive fruit.', 'Structures of some triterpenoids occurring in olive fruit
    cuticular waxes: I maslinic acid, II betulinic acid


    The level of triterpenoids in olives that are sold in the market can be significantly
    influenced not only by the cultivar or the stage of fruit ripeness, but also by
    the method of processing.', 'Higher concentrations of maslinic and oleanolic acids
    were found in olives that had not been treated with alkali, whereas pitting and
    stuffing did not significantly affect the level of these compounds.', 'Treatment
    with NaOH, which is employed to debitter the fruits, was shown to cause the loss
    of triterpene acids due to their solubilization in alkaline solutions.', 'Olive
    triterpenoids have been attributed numerous health-promoting properties, such
    as anticancer, antihyperglycemic and antiparasitic activities.', 'An extract from
    the skin of olive fruits, composed mainly of maslinic and oleanolic acids, inhibited
    proliferation and induced apoptosis in HT-29 human colon cancer cells in vitro.',
  "Subsequent studies on the activities of individual compounds revealed that oleanolic
    acid had a moderate antiproliferative effect on HT-29 cells and simultaneous moderate
    cytotoxicity at concentrations higher than 250 \u03BCmol/l, whereas maslinic acid
    inhibited cancer cell growth with an EC50 of 101 \u03BCmol/l without necrotic
    effects.", "Oleanolic acid failed to activate caspase-3, a prime apoptosis protease,
    whereas maslinic acid increased the activity of this enzyme by 3, 3.5 and five
    fold at non-toxic concentrations of 10, 25 and 50 \u03BCmol/l, respectively.",
  'Thus, maslinic acid was proposed as a promising new compound for the chemoprevention
    of colon cancers.', 'An in vivo study on hyperlipidemia induced in rats by a high
    cholesterol diet, revealed that posterior supplementation with olive pomace extracts
    rich in maslinic and oleanolic acids significantly modulated the consequent high
    levels of serum cholesterol and triglycerides, suggesting the possibility of utilizing
    olive pomaces for the prevention and treatment of hyperlipidemia.', 'The triterpenoids
    occurring in olive pomace oil, maslinic and oleanolic acids as well as erythrodiol
    and uvaol, induced vasorelaxation in the aorta of hypertensive rats.', "Erythrodiol
    and uvaol were also found to be potent inhibitors of the proliferation of human
    1321N1 astrocytoma cells in vitro, suggesting that these triterpenoids, which
    are capable of crossing the blood\u2013brain barrier, may have the potential for
    use in prevention and treatment of brain cancers.", It has been suggested that
    the induction of apoptosis by these compounds is mediated by the activation of
    a ROS/JNK pathway., Several studies have indicated that maslinic acid is a potent
    antiparasitic agent., 'When applied to erythrocytic cultures, maslinic acid hindered
    the maturation of Plasmodium falciparum from the ring to the schizont stage, and
    could thus prevent the release of merozoites and the subsequent invasion.', Maslinic
    acid effectively inhibited the proteolytic processing of the merozoite surface
    protein complex as well as plasmodial metalloproteases of the M16 family., 'Moreover,
    several others putative targets of maslinic acid have been suggested, such as
    phospholipase A2.', 'The identification of maslinic acid as a potential multi-target
    drug against the intra-erythrocytic cycle of Plasmodium may be highly significant
    for the treatment of malaria, because most antimalarials target only a single
    process of the parasite infective cycle, which favours the appearance of resistant
    mutants.', 'Maslinic acid was also proposed as a new natural coccidiostatic therapy
    against Eimeria tenella, a parasite causing coccidiosis in chickens, which has
    a considerable economic impact on poultry production.', 'The anticoccidial index,
    expressing the release of oocysts estimated at 10 days post-infection, was higher
    in chickens given maslinic acid than in those receiving sodium salinomycin, the
    conventional coccidiostatic treatment.', 'Furthermore, maslinic acid was also
    observed to affect the gliding of Toxoplasma gondii.', 'Due to the localization
    of olive triterpenoids in fruit cuticular waxes, olive oil, the most popular olive
    fruit product, contains only small amounts of these compounds.', 'The concentration
    of maslinic and oleanolic acids depends on the olive cultivar and the oil quality:
    extra virgin oils contain ;200 mg/kg of these triterpenoids, their content exceeds
    300 mg/kg in virgin oil, and crude pomace oils have up to 10 g/kg of these compounds,
    although the latter oils have to be refined before consumption.', "\u201COrujo\u201D
    or \u201Calpeorujo\u201D olive oil, as it is called in Spain, obtained from the
    pomace remaining after the mechanical extraction of virgin oil and subsequent
    centrifugation of the olive paste, represents a rich source of biologically active
    triterpenoids.", 'The olive oil industry generates large amounts of various wastes,
    which contain many important biologically active compounds, and there is growing
    interest in their recovery.', 'For example, maslinic acid obtained from the solid
    waste from olive-oil production was successfully applied as a feed additive to
    stimulate growth and hepatic protein-turnover rates in rainbow trout.', Tomato
    has achieved tremendous popularity over the last century and is now one of the
    most important fruit crops., "It is cultivated in practically every country in
    the world\u2014in outdoor fields, glasshouses and nethouses.", 'In contrast to
    many other fruits, triterpenoid content of tomato cuticular waxes has been studied
    in great detail.', "The occurrence of \u03B1-, \u03B2- and \u03B4-amyrin, taraxerol,
    taraxasterol, \u03C8-taraxasterol, lupeol, multiflorenol, germanicol, bauerenol,
    cycloartenol, stigmasterol and \u03B2-sitosterol was reported in cuticular wax
    extracted from the surface of tomato fruits.", 'It is noteworthy that the chemical
    composition of the triterpenoid fraction of tomato fruit cuticular waxes is strikingly
    different from the previously described cuticular waxes of apple, grape berries
    and olive, where triterpene acids are the most abundant compounds.', "These acids
    do not occur in tomato, where \u03B1-, \u03B2- and \u03B4-amyrins are the predominant
    compounds, with quantities that vary considerably in different cultivars and during
    the subsequent stages of fruit development.", "Structures of some triterpenoids
    occurring in tomato fruit cuticular waxes: I \u03B1-amyrin, II \u03B2-amyrin,
    III, \u03B4-myrin, IV, lupeol, V, taraksasterol, VI, \u03C8-taraksasterol\n\n\n\nDiverse
    cultivars and mutants of tomato have been collected over several decades, and
    almost one thousand monogenic stocks have been described so far, including mutants
    of the famous MicroTom, a miniature tomato with a rapid life cycle that is used
    as a model cultivar for functional genomics.", 'Thus, strong genetic and genomic
    tools are available to investigate processes associated with tomato fruit development
    and ripening, including the biosynthesis of cuticle lipids and subsequent composition
    diversity during fruit ontogeny, as well as the correlation between the chemical
    composition of the cuticular waxes and their function as a transpiration barrier.',
  'In contrast to the vegetative organs, very little molecular information is available
    regarding the biosynthetic pathways that are active in the surfaces of reproductive
    organs such as fleshy fruits.', Comparative transcriptome and metabolome analyses
    carried out on peel and flesh tissues during tomato fruit development revealed
    that different tissues play diverse roles in fruit ripening., "Triterpenoids appear
    to be formed during early fruit expansion rather than full ripening, since the
    levels of the most abundant triterpenols increased most significantly 25\u201342
    days after flower anthesis.", 'Triterpenoid levels were found to nearly triple
    from the small green to the mature green stages of tomato fruit development, but
    changed only slightly during the transformation to the red ripe stage.', Two genes
    involved in biosynthesis of triterpenoids have been isolated from tomato fruits
    and functionally characterized by heterologous expression in yeast as well as
    overexpression in tomato., "One encodes a \u03B2-amyrin synthase, which produced
    \u03B2-amyrin as a single product, while the other encodes a multifunctional oxidosqualene
    cyclase, which yielded a triterpenol mixture containing \u03B4-amyrin, \u03B2-amyrin,
    \u03B1-amyrin, multiflorenol, \u03C8-taraxasterol, taraxasterol and two unindentified
    triterpenoids.", The product profile of these two enzymes resembles the range
    and relative amounts of triterpenoids found in the fruit cuticle., 'Both enzymes
    were found to be expressed exclusively in the epidermis of the tomato fruit, indicating
    that their major function is to form the cuticular triterpenoids.', "However,
    the ratios of the specific transcripts did not fully explain the variation in
    the fruit triterpenoid profiles of different tomato cultivars, with a \u03B4-amyrin:
    \u03B2-amyrin: \u03B1-amyrin ratios of 3:3:2 in MicroTom and 3:2:2 in most other
    cultivars.", Some mutants have a triterpenoid profile that is slightly different
    from wild-type plants., "For example \u03B1-, \u03B2- and \u03B4-amyrin, \u03B2-amyrin
    derivative, lupeol derivative I, multiflorenol, taraxasterol, \u03C8-taraxasterol,
    lanosterol and stigmasterol were identified as common constituents of the fruit
    waxes of wild-type MicroTom and its lecer6 mutant, whereas \u03B2-sitosterol and
    taraxerol were detected exclusively in the wild-type fruit, and the occurrence
    of lupeol and lupeol derivative II was restricted to the cuticular wax of lecer6
    fruits.", The lecer6 mutant was used to study the consequences of a deficiency
    in very-long-chain aliphatics synthesis for fruit wax composition and the properties
    of the cuticle as a transpiration barrier., 'The total amount of wax was only
    slightly reduced in the mutant plants, but n-alkanes with chain lengths beyond
    C30 were missing.', "The decrease in aliphatic components was compensated by a
    three to six fold increase in the level of triterpenoids, mainly \u03B1-, \u03B2-
    and \u03B4-amyrins, accumulated in the intracuticular layer.", 'Experimental removal
    of the epicuticular wax layer, accounting for one-third of the total wax cover
    on wild-type fruits, had only a moderate effect on transpiration, whereas the
    reduction of intracuticular aliphatics in the mutant caused a four fold increase
    in cuticle permeability.', 'It was concluded that the major portion of the transpiration
    barrier is located in the intracuticular wax layer and is largely determined by
    its aliphatic constituents, since an increase in the level of cuticular triterpenoids
    could not compensate for the loss of aliphatics.', 'Moreover, the composition
    of the wax mixture also influences the morphological structure of cuticular waxes,
    which is an important determinant of cuticle permeability.', 'The wax barrier
    consists of impermeable clusters of crystalline zones embedded in a matrix of
    amorphous material, and the diffusion of water occurs mainly in the amorphous
    volume fractions.', 'It was postulated that triterpenoids are localized exclusively
    in the amorphous zones, so the increase in their content caused spatial rearrangements,
    and this was the direct reason for the increase in cuticular transpiration.',
  The level of triterpenoids was found to differ significantly in wild-type MicroTom
    and its lecer6 mutant during the course of fruit maturation., 'The content of
    these compounds was initially similar in immature green fruits of both plants,
    but at the stage of mature green fruit, the level of triterpenoids increased sharply
    to 80 % of total wax in lecer6 and it remained at such a high level during all
    stages of fruit development until the red ripe and red overripe phases.', 'In
    the wild-type plant, the triterpenoid content peaked in the mature green phase
    at 53 % of total wax, and then displayed a continuous decline to 21 % in red overripe
    fruit.', 'With the exception of immature green fruits, the lecer6 mutant exhibited
    three to eight fold increased water loss compared with the wild-type, thus confirming
    a direct relationship between the properties of the cuticular transpiration barrier
    and chemical modifications in cuticular wax composition.', 'These findings were
    later confirmed in a comparison of wild-type tomato culivars John Baer and Pearson
    with their respective positional sterile mutants, which besides functional male
    sterility also showed striking phenotypic similarity to the MicroTom lecer6 mutant.',
  "The content of pentacyclic triterpenes and sterol derivatives in wild-type and
    ps mutant fruit cuticular waxes was 19 and 44 %, respectively, with the most prominent
    triterpenoids being \u03B1-, \u03B2- and \u03B4-amyrins in wild-types, and \u03B2-amyrin
    and cholesterol in ps mutants.", The ps mutant fruit showed a five to eight fold
    increase in water permeability compared with the corresponding wild-type tomatoes.,
  'Recently, wild relatives of cultivated tomato have been studied to evaluate the
    relationship between evolution, structure and function of the cuticle.', 'These
    species, Solanum Sect.', 'Lycopersicon, evolved from a common ancestor about 7
    million years ago and today they are endemic to an array of environments in the
    northern Andes and Galapagos Islands.', They can still be crossed with S. lycopersicum
    and share a high degree of genomic synteny., 'However, striking differences in
    cuticular architecture and the quantities of cutin and waxes have been observed,
    with the wax coverage of the wild varieties exceeding that of cultivated tomatoes
    by up to seven fold.', "Triterpenoids were found to be the major non-aliphatic
    compounds of the fruit cuticles, accounting for 1\u201335 % of the total wax,
    although they could not be detected in one species, S. pennellii.", "The predominant
    isomers were \u03B1-, \u03B2- and \u03B4-amyrins, with \u03C8\u2013taraxasterol
    and taraxasterol present at much lower levels.", "However, in S. habrochaites,
    \u03B2-amyrin was the only pentacyclic triterpenoid detected.", A correlation
    between a decreasing prevalence of triterpenoids and phylogenic distance from
    S. lycopersicum was identified., 'In addition, it was confirmed that besides evolutionary
    adaptation, environmental growth conditions can have a substantial effect on cuticle
    properties.', "The main health benefits correlated with the consumption of tomatoes
    are usually ascribed to the occurrence of lycopene and \u03B2-carotene, vitamins
    and potassium.", 'However, a number of pharmacological properties, such as antiallergic,
    antidepressant, antiinflammatory, antinociceptive, antipruritic, anxiolytic, gastroprotective
    and hepatoprotective activities of the amyrins have been reported.', The mixture
    of amyrins employed in these studies was usually obtained from leaves or plant
    resins., 'If current research on potential pharmacological applications of amyrins
    produces promising results, it may be economically justified to devise methods
    to obtain these compounds from by-products, like tomato peel, that remain after
    the annual processing of millions of tonnes of tomatoes into juice, ketchup, sauce,
    concentrate and other products.', 'Edible berries of the genus Vaccinium, including
    lowbush blueberry V. angustifolium, rabbiteye blueberry V. ashei, highbush blueberry
    V. corymbosum, cranberry V. macrocarpon Ait., bilberry V. myrtillus L. and lingonberry
    V. vitis-idaea L. are valued for the high content of phenolic antioxidants and
    numerous health benefits ascribed to their consumption.', 'Moreover, the occurrence
    of triterpenoids, mainly ursolic and oleanolic acids and their derivatives, is
    also well documented for some of these fruits.', 'Cranberry, native to North America,
    has attracted public interest as a functional food preventing bacterial adhesion
    in urinary tract infections and stomach ulcers, protecting against lipoprotein
    oxidation, reducing cholesterol level and showing in vitro anticancer activity.',
  'Together with apple, pear, cherry and prune, cranberry cuticular wax is regarded
    as one of the richest natural sources of ursolic acid.', "As early as 1934, the
    wax extracted from cranberry pomace was shown to contain significant amounts of
    this compound and thus \u201Ccrude ursolic acid\u201D started to be produced commercially
    from a waste product of cranberry juice production.", "Later, more detailed study
    also revealed the presence of considerable amounts of oleanolic acid, methyl ursolate
    and methyl oleanolate, \u03B1- and \u03B2-amyrins and their acetates, as well
    as \u03B2-sitosterol and stigmasterol, altogether comprising 50 % of a chloroform
    extract.", 'At that time, the highly complex composition of fruit cuticular wax,
    and especially the occurrence of several classes of triterpenoids with different
    ratios of ursane and oleanane skeletons in each of them, seemed somewhat unusual.',
  'Recently, two hydroxycinnamate esters of ursolic acid, occurring in ethyl acetate
    extracts from whole cranberry fruit and its products containing peel, were shown
    to possess antiproliferative activities against several types of tumor cells in
    vitro, including MCF-7 breast, HT-29 colon, DU-145 prostate, H460 lung, ME180
    cervical and K562 leukemia cell lines.', Cranberry juice and juice-derived sauce
    appear not to contain significant amounts of these compounds., Ursolic acid is
    the predominat compound in the fruit cuticular wax of sweet cherry., 'Studies
    on the composition of cuticular waxes during sweet cherry fruit development showed
    that triterpenoids represented the main class of wax constituents, with ursolic
    acid accounting for 60 % and oleanolic acid for 7.5 %.', "Triterpene alcohols
    of the ursane type were present in smaller amounts, and some other triterpenoids
    could not be identified by GC\u2013MS due to their low abundance.", 'The initially
    very high level of triterpenoids in sweet cherry fruit cuticular wax, decreased
    by 18 % at 85 days of fruit development to the level characteristic for the mature
    stage.', 'Thus, P. avium displays a pattern of cuticle development that resemble
    that of many other non-climacteric fruits, which after depositing maximum levels
    of wax very early in fruit development, exhibit decreasing amounts of wax during
    ripening.', 'As shown for tomato, triterpene acids are not always present in fruit
    cuticular waxes.', "In Asian pear fruit, triterpenoids constituted 33.6 % of the
    total wax, with \u03B1-amyrin and urs-12-en-28-al being the predominant compounds
    in a triterpenoid profile comprising 10 constituents.", "In bell pepper, 18 triterpenoid
    compounds were identified, accounting for 34.9 % of the total wax extract, with
    \u03B1-amyrin as the most abundant compound followed by \u03B2-amyrin.", 'Oranges,
    grapefruits, mandarines and other fruits of the genus Citrus L. are generally
    peeled when eaten fresh or consumed in the form of juice.', 'Therefore, cuticular
    waxes of these fruits have been investigated not because of their nutritional
    value, but in relation to surface disorders like rindstaining, peel pitting or
    chilling injury, which can cause deterioration of fruit quality.', 'Among cuticular
    constituents of orange, tangerine and lemon harvested in central Florida, triterpenoids
    were found to constitute a minor fraction, with notable amounts of ursolic acid.',
  "During fruit ripening, the triterpenoid content of total cuticular wax ranged between
    3.3 and 9.4 % in Satsuma mandarins growing in the area of Valencia, and between
    3.3\u20138 % and 3.7\u201313.6 % in rindstaining-susceptible and non-susceptible
    Navelina oranges, respectively.", 'Similarly, triterpenoids were a minor class
    of fruit cuticular wax component in Fortune mandarins grown in the same region,
    although their abundance in citrus fruits varied between cultivars and within
    the same cultivar grown in orchards in different geographical locations.', 'Nevertheless,
    triterpenoids were never predominant compounds in any orange or mandarin cultivar.',
  'In contrast, triterpenoids were found to be the most prevalent compounds in the
    fruit cuticular wax of grapefruit, where they account for 50 % of total wax.',
  'Furthermore, ursolic acid was not detected in grapefruit cuticular waxes, and the
    predominant compound was identified as the triterpene ketone, friedelin.', 'Friedelin
    was reported to be present in grapefruit peel as early as 1955, and is probably
    the first triterpene ketone to be described in fruit cuticular wax.', 'Recently,
    the biological properties of this compound, including antiinflammatory, analgestic
    and antipyretic activities, were investigated.', "Other triterpenoids, including
    \u03B1- and \u03B2-amyrin, \u03B1- and \u03B2- amyrin acetate, the ketones: \u03B1-
    and \u03B2-amyrone, and 24-methylenecycloartanol were also detected in the fruit
    cuticular wax of Marsch grapefruit grown in central Florida.", "Lupeol and two
    other compounds, tentatively assigned as D:B-friedo-B\u2032:A\u2032-neogammacer-5-en-ol
    and D:C-friedooleanen-3-one, were subsequently added to this triterpenoid profile.",
  'Thus, grapefruit peel is characterized by particularly high levels of triterpenones.',
  'Structure of friedelin occurring in fruit cuticular waxes of grapefruit


    Studies on fruits belonging to the genus Citrus have revealed that the chemical
    composition of cuticular wax can be very different regardless of systematic relationships.',
  'Likewise, the triterpenoid content in fruit cuticular waxes of the eggplant, which
    accounted for only 2.9 % of the total wax extract, is surprisingly low compared
    with other members of the family Solanaceae, such as tomato and bell pepper.',
  The tree Eucalyptus globulus Labill., 'is exploited for its wood, which is used
    by the pulp and paper industry, and for the essential oil extracted from the leaves.',
  'After harvesting the wood and leaves, large quantities of unwanted biomass, including
    the fruits, are discarded.', Knowledge of the chemical composition of these unused
    plant parts could help to solve the problem of this waste material and increase
    the economic value of E. globulus cultivation., "The cuticular wax of E. globulus
    fruit was shown to contain a significant amount of triterpenoids, including ursolic
    acid, which accounted for 17.1 % of total wax, and an interesting series of other
    triterpene acids, such as 3-acetyl-oleanolic acid, betulinic acid, betulonic acid,
    3\u03B2-dihydroxyurs-11-en-13\u03B2(28)-olide, oleanolic acid and 3\u03B2,11\u03B1-dihydroxyurs-12-en-28-oic
    acid, the last of which was identified for the first time.", 'Betulinic acid,
    usually obtained from the bark of the white birch Betula alba L., has been shown
    to possess a variety of biological properties including antibacterial, anti-HIV,
    antimalarial, antiinflammatory and anthelmintic activities.', Betulonic acid and
    its derivatives have been studied as a new group of agents that reduce the side
    effects of cytostatics., 'Therefore, the cuticular waxes of E. globulus fruit
    contain at least four biologically active triterpene acids that may be utilized
    rather than wasted.', Epidemiological studies have shown that regular consumption
    of fruit and vegetables is associated with a reduced risk of chronic diseases
    occurring in the aging human population., 'The health benefits of plant-based
    foods are attributed to bioactive phytochemicals, including triterpenoids and
    other groups of natural compounds, acting in an additive and synergistic way.',
  'No single compound can replace the combination of various phytonutrients, playing
    their complementary or synergistic roles together.', 'Fruits are a good example
    of such functional mixtures of water-soluble compounds, including many antioxidants
    occurring in the flesh, and lipophilic constituents of the cuticle.', 'Fruit cuticular
    waxes are receiving growing attention because they can have a significant influence
    on the production, storage and processing of agricultural commodities.', 'Moreover,
    compositional studies on these waxes have revealed the occurrence of many biologically
    active triterpenoids, which, in several cases, accummulate to high concentrations,
    making the fruit peel an attractive and readily available source of these compounds.',
  'Over the last decade, there has been a increasing interest in pharmaceutical, nutraceutical
    and cosmeceutical applications of triterpenoids, and they are currently under
    development as therapeutic agents in numerous treatments, and as functional compounds
    in many healthcare products.', Triterpenoids are highly multifunctional and thus
    promising in the chemoprevention and chemotherapy of cancer and as antiparasitic
    agents., 'However, their activities have usually been demonstrated only in vitro,
    and although there are extensive preclinical data to support the supposed anticancer
    properties of triterpenoids, only clinical studies can fully validate them.',
  'Due to the low polarity and consequently poor aqueous solubility of triterpenoids
    occurring in free and ester forms, their real bioavailability has been questioned,
    and formulations based on nanotechnologies have been proposed to replace conventional
    dosage forms.', 'At the same time, numerous triterpenoid derivatives with increased
    bioactivity and improved bioavailability have been synthesized by structural modifications
    of natural compounds.', 'Since triterpenoids, both in their natural forms and
    as templates for synthetic modification, are currently of interest to both researchers
    and industry, natural sources supplying high concentrations of these compounds
    are in demand.', 'Food industries produce large volumes of wastes, the disposal
    of which is problematic and may potentially cause environmental pollution.', 'Millions
    of tonnes of apple, grape berry, olive, tomato, orange and other fruit peels are
    generated each year as agro-industrial waste which may be utilized to produce
    various useful materials, fuels and chemicals, including triterpenoid-containing
    products.', 'Fruit pomace is often composted and used as a fertilizer, but sometimes
    it can have an adverse ecological impact due to the allelopathic activities of
    phenolic compounds inhibiting seed germination.', 'As the human population grows
