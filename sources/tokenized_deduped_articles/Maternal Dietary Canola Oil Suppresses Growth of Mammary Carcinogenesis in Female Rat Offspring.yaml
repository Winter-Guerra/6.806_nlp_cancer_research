['As suggested by rodent studies and studies using human breast cancer cells, dietary
    canola oil is linked with lower breast cancer risk.', 'Here, we investigated the
    effect of maternal dietary canola oil on the susceptibility of female Sprague-Dawley
    rat offspring to mammary carcinogenesis.', 'Although the control diet had 10%
    soybean oil, the treatment diet was formulated to contain 10% canola oil as a
    fat source.', N-nitroso-N-methylurea was injected to induce mammary cancer in
    offspring., 'The offspring of canola-fed dams showed significantly decreased tumor
    multiplicity and tumor volume, along with increased survival rate.', 'In addition,
    the mRNA expression of development-related gamma-glutamyltransferase 1 was significantly
    higher in the lactating mammary tissues of the canola group dams and mammary tumor
    tissues of the offspring .', These results suggest a potential anticancer effect
    of maternal dietary canola oil and may be useful in devising prenatal nutritional
    strategies to reduce breast cancer risk in humans.]
