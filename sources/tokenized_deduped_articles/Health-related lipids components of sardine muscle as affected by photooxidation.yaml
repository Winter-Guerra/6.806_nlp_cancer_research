[The aim of this study was to evaluate the oxidative stability of sardine muscle lipids
    as related to the storage conditions., "Whole sardines were stored at 4 \xB0C
    for 4 h under light exposure and at dark.", "The lowest levels of peroxide value,
    thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, cholesterol oxidation products and the
    highest level of polyunsaturated fatty acids content, especially PUFA n \u2212
    3, were found in the untreated sardines.", 'After light exposure, PUFA dramatically
    dropped and a marked increase of PV, TBARs and COPs was observed; under darkness,
    the values of the oxidation parameters were similar to those found in untreated
    sardines.', 'Although cholesterol oxidation rate did not exceed 0.9%, further
    research is required about toxicity levels of the single COPs, to better understand
    if the COPs levels found in untreated and photoxidized muscle do not represent
    a risk for human health.']
