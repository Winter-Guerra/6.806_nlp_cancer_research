[': Phenolic acids have been identified in a variety of legumes including lima bean,
    broad bean, common bean, pea, jack bean, goa bean, adzuki bean, hyacinth bean,
    chicking vetch, garbanzo bean, dral, cow bean, rice bean, mung bean and soybean.',
  "The present study was carried out with the following aims: to identify and quantify
    the individual phenolic acid and determine the total phenolic content; to assess
    their antioxidant activity, inhibition activities of \u03B1-glucosidase, tyrosinase,
    and formation of advanced glycation endproducts; and to investigate correlations
    among the phytochemicals and biological activity.", Common bean possesses the
    highest antioxidant activity and advanced glycation endproducts formation inhibition
    activity., "Adzuki bean has the highest \u03B1-glucosidase inhibition activity,
    and mung bean has the highest tyrosinase inhibition activity.", There are significant
    differences in phytochemical content and functional activities among the bean
    species investigated., 'Selecting beans can help treat diseases such as dermatological
    hyperpigmentation illness, type 2 diabetes and associated cardiovascular diseases.',
  "legumes; antioxidant; \u03B1-glucosidase inhibition; advanced glycation endproducts;
    tyrosinase inhibition \n\n\n\nLegumes as a functional food ingredient have gained
    a lot of interest .", 'Proteins , saponins  and phenolic compounds  present in
    beans are active ingredients responsible for benefits associated with the consumption
    of beans.', 'Phenolic compounds have been reported to reduce the risk of cancer,
    heart disease, and diabetes, as well as have antibacterial, antiviral, anti-inflammatory,
    and anti-allergenic activities.', Many of these benefits result from the antioxidant
    characteristics ., 'Antioxidants refer to compounds possessing free radical-scavenging
    activity, transition metal-chelating activity, and/or singlet oxygen-quenching
    capacity .', Several studies have suggested that the cells of diabetic patients
    are under oxidative stress with an imbalance between free radical-generating and
    radical-scavenging capacities., The increased free radical production and reduced
    antioxidant defense may partially mediate the initiation and progression of diabetes-associated
    complications ., "Acting as a key enzyme for carbohydrate digestion, intestinal
    \u03B1-glucosidase is one of the glucosidases located at the epithelium of the
    small intestine.", "\u03B1-Glucosidase has been recognized as a therapeutic target
    for modulation of postprandial hyperglycaemia, which is the earliest metabolic
    abnormality to occur in type 2 diabetes mellitus .", "Inhibition of intestinal
    \u03B1-glucosidases delays the digestion and absorption of carbohydrates, thereby
    suppressing postprandial hyperglycaemia .", 'Advanced glycation end products are
    part of a major pathogenic process in diabetic complications including neuropathy,
    nephropathy, retinopathy, atherosclerosis and cataracts .', 'Thus, the discovery
    and investigation of AGE inhibitors would offer a potential therapeutic approach
    for the prevention of diabetic complications.', 'Free radicals can up-regulate
    the mRNA level for tyrosinase, and amplify the production of melanin that correlates
    directly with serious problems in human skin .', 'Acting as a key enzyme for synthesis
    of melanin pigments, tyrosinase catalyzes two distinct reactions in melanin synthesis:
    the hydroxylation of l-tyrosine to l-dopa and the oxidation of l-dopa to dopaquinone,
    after further series of conversions to the melanin produced .', 'The inhibitors
    of tyrosinase have been used to treat some dermatological hyperpigmentation illness
    connected with overproduction of melanin, which also play a significant role in
    the cosmetic business as a skin whitening agent .', "Phenolic acids have been
    reported in some legumes, however, there is still a lack of systematic study of
    diverse species beans on the relative abundance of total phenolic content, and
    their antioxidant, \u03B1-glucosidase inhibition, advanced glycation endproducts
    formation inhibition, and tyrosinase inhibition activities.", Fifteen edible beans
    were grown in China in 2009., The names and places of production of the beans
    are shown in Table 1., 'Standards of p-hydroxybenzoic acid, gentisic acid, vanillic
    acid, caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, syringic acid, p-coumaric acid, ferulic

    radical, Folin-Ciocalteu phenolic reagent, rat intestinal acetone powder, bovine
    serum albumin(BSA), d-glucose, methylglyoxal, l-DOPA and mushroom tyrosinase were
    purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.', All of the chemicals were of analytical grade
    and were obtained from Beijing Chemical Reagent., All of the analytical grade
    solvents for high performance liquid chromatography were purchased from Fisher
    Chemicals., All dried samples were ground in a laboratory mill and passed through
    a sieve., Bean samples were extracted twice in 100 mL of 70% ethanol for 2 h at
    room temperature., "After vacuum filtration, the supernatants were combined and
    concentrated under reduced pressure in a rotary evaporator at 50 \xB0C.", "After
    freeze-drying, the sample powder was stored at \u221220 \xB0C until analysis.",
  The biological activities of the azuki beans were measured at a concentration of
    15 mg/mL., 'HPLC system was equipped with two Shimadzu LC-20A pumps, a Shimadzu
    LC-20 autosampler, a SPD-20A UV/vis detector and an Alltima C18 column.', The
    wavelength of the UV detector was set at 280 nm., The mobile phase was a mixture
    of solvent A and solvent B., 'The gradient elution was programmed as follows:

    rate was set at 1.0 mL/min, and the injection volume was 10 \u03BCL.", Each phenolic
    acid was quantified according to its calibration curve., TPC was measured using
    the Folin-Ciocalteu method described previously ., "\u03BCBriefly, 50 L of the
    extract was mixed in 5 mL of distilled deionised water followed by the addition
    of 500 \u03BCL of 1 M Folin-Ciocalteu reagent and 500 \u03BCL of a 20% Na2CO3
    solution.", The mixture was thoroughly mixed and allowed to stand for 60 min at
    room temperature before the absorbance was measured at 765 nm., Quantification
    was performed with respect to the standard curve of gallic acid., The results
    were expressed as milligrams of gallic acid equivalent per gram., The DPPH radical-scavenging
    activity was determined using the method reported by Yen and Chen ., DPPH was
    dissolved in 96% ethanol., The DPPH solution was mixed with 1 mL of the extract
    solution., The mixture was shaken and allowed to stand at room temperature in
    the dark for 10 min., The decrease in absorbance of the resulting solution was
    measured at 517 nm after 10 min., The results were expressed in micromoles of
    Trolox equivalents per gram., "The \u03B1-glucosidase inhibition activity was
    determined as described previously .", "\u03B1-Glucosidase inhibition activity
    was assayed using 50 \u03BCL of extracts with varying concentrations incubated
    with 100 \u03BCL of 0.1 M phosphate buffer in 96-well plates at 37 \xB0C for 10
    min.", "After preincubation, 50 \u03BCL of 5 mM p-nitrophenyl-\u03B1-d-glucopyranoside
    in a 0.1 M phosphate buffer was added to each well.", "The reaction mixtures were
    incubated at 37 \xB0C for 5 min.", The absorbance readings were recorded at 490
    nm on a microplate reader before and after incubation., "The results were expressed
    as a percent of \u03B1-glucosidase inhibition, and the inhibition activity was
    calculated according to the following equation:/Acontrol \xD7 100%.", BSA-glucose
    and BSA-MGO models were used for the evaluation of the inhibition effect of the
    extracts on the formation of advanced glycation end products., The BSA-glucose
    assay was carried out according the method reported by Peng and others ., 'Briefly,
    5 g of BSA and 14.4 g of d-glucose were dissolved in 1.5 M phosphate buffer to
    obtain the control solution with 50 mg/mL BSA and 0.8 M d-glucose.', "Two milliliters
    of the control solution was incubated at 37 \xB0C for 7 days in the presence or
    absence of 1 mL of bean extracts in a 1.5 M phosphate buffer.", 'After 7 days
    of incubation, fluorescent intensity was measured.', "Percent inhibition of AGE
    formation by each extract was calculated using the following equation:) \xD7 100%.",
  The BSA-MGO assay was carried out according to the method reported by Yao and others
    ., "Briefly, 40 mg of BSA was mixed with 31 \u03BCL of MGO in a 0.1 M phosphate
    buffer to obtain the control solution with 1 mg/mL BSA and 5 mM MGO.", "Two milliliters
    of the control solution was incubated at 37 \xB0C for 6 days with or without 1
    mL of the bean extracts in phosphate buffer.", The percent inhibition was calculated
    based on the equation applied in the BSA-glucose assay as described above., The
    tyrosinase activity was determined as described previously ., Assays were conducted
    in a 96-well microtiter plate and a plate reader was used to measure absorbance
    at 475 nm., "Each well contained 40 \u03BCL of sample with 80 \u03BCL of phosphate
    buffer, 40 \u03BCL of tyrosinase and 40 \u03BCL of l-DOPA, the samples were incubated
    for 30 min at 37 \xB0C.", Control had all the components except tyrosinase., "The
    percentage tyrosinase inhibition was calculated as follows:/Acontrol \xD7 100%\n\n\n\nAll
    values were expressed as mean \xB1 SD.", Data were analyzed using one-way analysis
    of variance followed by Tukey-Kramer test., 'Five phenolic acids were found in
    those beans, the contents of individual phenolic acid in the different bean samples
    are shown in Table 2.', "It was found that ferulic acid was the dominant phenolic
    acid in all beans, the highest content was 26.06 \xB1 2.19 mg/100 g in common
    bean and the lowest one was 9.10 \xB1 1.29 mg/100 g in garbanzo bean.", 'The highest
    p-coumaric acid was found in common bean, 10.3 times higher than that in goa bean,
    which was the lowest among all the bean samples investigated in this study.',
  It was also found that TPC as measured by Folin-Ciocalteu method varied widely in
    legumes., Phenolic compounds are considered as the major compounds that contribute
    to the total antioxidant activities of the grains ., "In the present study, common
    bean, with an average of 8.59 \xB1 0.11 mg GAE/g, was found to possess the highest
    TPC among all of the studied legumes and had 8.3 times greater than that of garbanzo
    bean.", 'Mung bean had a high level of phenolics, this observation is in agreement
    with that of Peng et al ; they found that mung bean extract had the highest TPC
    among mung bean, black bean, soybean and cow bean.', The antioxidant activities
    of legume extracts were evaluated by measuring their DPPH radical scavenging activities.,
  'All of the extracts exhibited strong antioxidant activities, DPPH showed the same
    trends as did in TPC.', 'Among the tested samples, common bean had the highest
    DPPH free radical scavenging activity, whereas garbanzo bean had the lowest DPPH
    free radical scavenging activity.', 'Our results on DPPH in soybean were in agreement
    with that reported previously , the results from garbanzo bean were in agreement
    with that of the previous report , while the other results from pea, and common
    bean in a previous report based on dry weight .', Differences between our results
    and previous reports may be attributed partly to the differences in the sources
    of materials and in expressions based on dry weight or fresh basis calculation.,
  It is difficult to compare our data to that reported by Amarowicz and Ronaldsince  as
    they were expressed in a different unit., It was found that TPC were highly correlated
    with their antioxidant activity., Similar effect was found in the study by Yao
    et al., who investigated seven color grains and found the antioxidant activity
    showed a positive correlation with their TPC., Antioxidant activity of phenolics
    depends on the structure and substitution pattern of hydroxyl groups., 'p-Coumaric
    can exhibit competitive antioxidant activity because of the 4-position of hydroxylation
    on the phenolic ring and the additional conjugation in the propenoic side chain,
    which might facilitate the electron delocalization, by resonance, between the
    aromatic ring and propenoic group gives high antioxidant activity .', "Table 3
    shows that adzuki bean had the highest \u03B1-glucosidase inhibition activity,
    followed by the Goa bean.", Itoh et al., "investigated the antidiabetic effects
    of azuki beans on streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats, and they suggested that
    the active fraction of azuki beans suppresses the postprandial blood glucose by
    inhibiting \u03B1-glucosidase.", 'The inhibition in common bean, cow bean and
    rice bean was higher than 50%.', "\u03B1-Glucosidase inhibition was not statistically
    correlated with their phenolic acids and antioxidant activities of the extracts.",
  "Mccue and others  investigated fifteen Asian beans, fruits and vegetables, and
    they concluded that a high phenolic content does not always confer a high inhibition
    of \u03B1-glucosidase activity of a food extract, which may be due to the nonphenolic
    compounds in the samples.", The inhibition measured by BSA-glucose varied significantly
    among different beans., 'Common bean had the highest inhibition, followed by mung
    bean.', The inhibition measured by BSA-MGO showed the same trends as did BSA-glucose
    method., 'Common bean exhibited the highest inhibition, followed by mung bean.',
  Beans have been recommended as suitable foods for diabetic patients in the past
    mainly based on their high fiber and protein contents ., 'Recently, it has been
    reported that beans contained considerable bioactive phytochemicals, including
    phenolic compounds, which offer extra benefits for amelioration of diabetes and
    alleviating diabetic complications .', The results obtained in our study showed
    that BSA-MGO and BSA-gluocose significantly correlate with TPC assay., 'Similar
    results have been observed by Peng and others  who investigated the correlation
    of the total phenolic content and inhibition effect of the phenolics on the formation
    of advanced glycation end products of mung bean, black bean, soybean and cowpea,
    and they demonstrated that phenolic compounds inhibit the formation of advanced
    glycation end products by inhibition of free radical generation in the glycation
    process and subsequent inhibition of protein modifications.', 'In present study,
    mung bean with an average inhibition of 81.24%, had the highest tyrosinase inhibition
    activities among all the legumes and was 3.5 times higher than that of garbanzo
    bean.', Common bean also had a high level of inhibition., 'To our knowledge, this
    is the first report that edible beans have tyrosinase inhibition activities.',
  The results showed that tyrosinase inhibition activity significantly correlates
    with TPC and DPPH assays., 'Gomez-Cordoves and others  reported phenolic fractions
    inhibit melanogenic activity in melanocytes and decrease colony forming of melanoma
    cells, which support their potential as therapeutic agents in the treatments of
    human melanoma.', Melanogenesis is activated by oxidation related processes such
    as UV radiation., Melanogenesis requires tyrosinase activity and reactive species
    such as reactive oxygen and nitrogen species cause oxidative stress to the skin
    resulting in skin pigmentation and ageing ., 'Hence, controlling oxidative stress
    is important for the regulation of melanogenesis, since the antioxidant may be
    closely related to anti-melanogenic actions and regulation of melanin synthesis
    .', 'This was recently confirmed by Abdillahi  and Wu , where the anti-melanogenic
    activity of both Podocarpus and Taiwanese were attributed to their antioxidative
    actions.', 'In summary, there are significant differences in phytochemical content
    and functional activities among the bean species investigated.', "Common bean
    appeared to possess the highest antioxidant activity, adzuki bean has the highest
    \u03B1-glucosidase inhibition and advanced glycation endproducts formation, and
    mung bean has the highest tyrosinase inhibition activity among all the beans tested.",
  'These results provide useful information when selecting bean species for better
    design of potential functional food that can treat diseases such as dermatological
    hyperpigmentation illness, type 2 diabetes and associated cardiovascular diseases.',
  'The present study was supported by the Institute Fund from The Ministry of Sciences
    and Technology, China and the earmarked fund for Modern Agro-industry Technology
    Research System.']
