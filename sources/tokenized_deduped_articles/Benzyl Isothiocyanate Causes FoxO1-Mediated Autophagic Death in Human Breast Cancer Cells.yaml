  'The BITC-treated breast cancer cells and MDA-MB-231 xenografts from BITC-treated

    of double-membrane vacuoles and acidic vesicular organelles, cleavage of microtubule-associated

    partially but statistically significantly attenuated in the presence of autophagy

    to be a leading cause of cancer-related deaths in women worldwide even after remarkable
    progress towards targeted therapies ., "Novel approaches for chemoprevention of
    breast cancer are clinically attractive because many of the known risk factors
    associated with this devastating disease are beyond human control and currently
    available chemopreventive options, such as selective estrogen receptor modulators
    and aromatase inhibitors, are sub-optimal \u2013.", "Previous research in our
    laboratory as well as by others identifies benzyl isothiocyanate, a constituent
    of edible cruciferous vegetables such as garden cress, as a promising chemopreventive
    agent against breast cancer \u2013.", "Possible clinical application of BITC for
    prevention of mammary cancer is supported by the following preclinical observations:
    BITC inhibits chemically-induced mammary cancer in Sprague-Dawley rats , BITC
    inhibits growth of cultured human breast cancer cells regardless of the estrogen
    receptor expression or the p53 status \u2013, growth of a triple negative human
    breast cancer cell line subcutaneously implanted in female athymic mice is significantly
    retarded by BITC administration , and dietary feeding of 3 \xB5mol BITC/g diet

    transgenic mice without any signs of overt toxicity .", 'Furthermore, population-based
    case-control studies suggest that dietary intake of cruciferous vegetables may
    be protective against breast cancer , .', 'Even though the mechanisms underlying
    growth inhibitory effect of BITC against breast cancer are not fully understood,
    we have shown previously that BITC treatment inhibits complex III of the mitochondrial

    of c-Jun N-terminal kinase-Bax axis, and ultimately apoptotic cell death in MDA-MB-231
    and MCF-7 cells , .', Molecular circuitry of BITC-induced apoptosis downstream
    of ROS production also involves suppression of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis
    protein ., 'We showed further that while p53 tumor suppressor is dispensable for
    BITC-induced apoptosis, this chemopreventive agent is capable of suppressing oncogenic
    actions of leptin through inhibition of signal transducer and activator of transcription

    induction of autophagy , which is an evolutionary conserved process for bulk degradation
    of cellular components including organelles and considered a valid cancer chemotherapeutic
    target , we raised the question of whether growth suppressive effect of BITC was
    associated with autophagy induction.', 'The present study systematically addresses
    this question using cultured breast cancer cells, a spontaneously immortalized
    and non-tumorigenic normal human mammary epithelial cell line, and MDA-MB-231
    xenografts from control and BITC-treated mice as models.', Fig., 1A depicts representative
    transmission electron microscopic images of MDA-MB-231 cells following 12 h treatment
    with dimethyl sulfoxide or BITC., DMSO-treated control MDA-MB-231cells mostly
    exhibited healthy looking mitochondria., "On the other hand, exposure of MDA-MB-231
    cells to 2.5 \xB5M BITC for 6 h or 12 h resulted in appearance of double-membrane
    vacuoles resembling autophagosomes, which were infrequent in DMSO-treated control
    cells.", "Autophagic response to BITC treatment was confirmed by analysis of acidic
    vesicular organelles and cleavage of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain
    3, which are hallmarks of autophagy \u2013.", The AVOs were visualized by fluorescence
    microscopy following staining with the lysosomotropic agent acridine orange.,
  Acridine orange is a weak base that is able to move freely across biological membranes
    characterized by weak and diffuse green fluorescence., 'The protonated form of
    acridine orange accumulates in acidic compartments and forms aggregates, which
    is characterized by yellow-orange fluorescence.', 'Treatment of cells with BITC
    for 6 h or 9 h resulted in formation of yellow-orange AVOs, which were rare in
    DMSO-treated control cells.', 'Cleavage of LC3, a protein critical for autophagic
    machinery , is another widely used criterion for detection of autophagy.', 'During
    autophagy LC3 is cleaved to a 16 kDa intermediate that localizes to the autophagosomes

    previously that BITC treatment significantly retards growth of MDA-MB-231 xenografts
    in female athymic mice without causing any side effects ., We used archived tumor
    tissues from the same experiment to determine whether BITC treatment caused cleavage
    of LC3 in vivo., As shown in Fig., '2B, expression of full-length as well as cleaved
    LC3 was barely detectable in the MDA-MB-231 xenografts from control mice.', 'On
    the other hand, the MDA-MB-231 tumors from the BITC-treated mice exhibited induction

    such experiment are shown., 'Next, we designed experiments to determine the functional
    significance of autophagy in BITC-mediated suppression of cell viability using
    a pair of chemical inhibitors of autophagy, 3-methyl adenine and bafilomycin A1.',
  "For these experiments, the cells were first pre-treated for 2 h with 5 mM 3-MA
    or 3 nM Baf and then exposed to 2.5 \xB5M BITC for 6 h in the presence of the
    inhibitor prior to trypan blue dye exclusion assay.", The inhibitor concentrations
    were optimized based on lack of cellular toxicity and inhibition of BITC-mediated
    cleavage of LC3., "Viability of MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, and MDA-MB-468 cells was decreased
    by about 38\u201348% upon 6 h treatment with 2.5 \xB5M BITC.", 'While 3-MA alone
    was non-toxic to these cells, suppression of cell viability resulting from BITC
    exposure was partially but statistically significantly attenuated in the presence
    of 3-MA.', Similarly a non-toxic concentration of Baf conferred partial yet significant
    protection against BITC-mediated growth inhibition in both MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7
    cells., 'Because BITC treatment also causes apoptotic cell death in these breast
    cancer cells , , partial protection against cell killing is expected.', 'Thus,
    it is reasonable to conclude that autophagy induction by BITC did not impart a
    survival advantage in breast cancer cells.', We have shown previously that the
    BITC-induced apoptotic cell death in human breast cancer cells is accompanied
    by ROS production ., 'Moreover, the BITC-induced ROS production and apoptosis
    are significantly reversed by overexpression of catalase or superoxide dismutase
    .', 'We raised the question of whether BITC-induced autophagy in our model was
    dependent on ROS production, which was likely based on recent literature implicating
    ROS in autophagy induction .', The MDA-MB-231 cells with stable overexpression
    of manganese SOD were partially resistant to BITC-mediated cleavage of LC3 compared
    with empty vector-transfected control cells., The LC3 punctate staining resulting
    from BITC exposure was also partially attenuated by Mn-SOD overexpression., 'Mn-SOD
    overexpressing MDA-MB-231 cells were relatively more resistant to killing by BITC
    exposure compared with empty vector-transfected control, but the difference did
    not reach statistical significance.', 'On the other hand, BITC-mediated increase
    in histone-associated DNA fragment release into the cytosol was completely abolished
    in the Mn-SOD overexpressing cells in comparison with empty vector transfected
    cells.', These results indicated that the ROS production alone did not fully account
    for the BITC-induced autophagy in MDA-MB-231 cells., 'Nevertheless, it was obvious
    that BITC treatment simultaneously triggered both apoptotic and autophagic cell
    death in breast cancer cells.', Serine-threonine kinase mTOR has emerged as a
    key negative regulator of autophagy in cancer cells ., Initially we determined
    the effect of BITC treatment on phosphorylation of mTOR as well as its downstream
    substrates P70s6k and 4E-BP1., As shown in Fig., '4A, BITC-treated MDA-MB-231
    and MCF-7 cells exhibited a marked decrease in levels of phospho-(S2448)-mTOR,
    phospho-(S65)-4E-BP1, and phospho-(T389)-P70s6k.', "In addition, levels of phospho-(S2448)-mTOR,
    total mTOR, and phospho-(T389)-P70s6k were decreased by 100%, 80%, and 95%, respectively,
    in MDA-MB-231 xenografts from 7.5 \xB5mol BITC-treated mice compared with those
    from control mice.", These results demonstrated inhibition of mTOR by BITC in
    vitro and in vivo., Figure 4., BITC treatment suppresses phosphorylation of mTOR

    bands represent change in protein level relative to corresponding DMSO-treated
    control.', Immunoblotting for each protein was performed at least twice using
    independently prepared lysates and the results were comparable., "Immunoblotting

    mice.", Densitometric quantitation for control and BITC-treated groups is shown
    on top of the bands., Difference in expression of mTOR and phospho-P70s6k between
    control and BITC groups was statistically significant by two-tailed Students t-test.,
  We next conducted experiments involving transient overexpression of Rheb to determine
    the functional significance of mTOR suppression in autophagic response to BITC.,
  The Rheb activates mTOR by antagonizing its endogenous inhibitor FKBP38 ., Ectopic
    expression of Rheb in MDA-MB-231 cells resulted in activation of mTOR as evidenced
    by about 4.9-fold increase in T389 phosphorylation of P70s6k., 'However, Rheb-mediated
    activation of mTOR did not impart a meaningful protection against BITC-induced
    cleavage of LC3, LC3 puncta or cell growth inhibition.', These observations were
    not unique to the MDA-MB-231 cell line because Rheb-mediated activation of mTOR
    failed to confer any protection against BITC-induced autophagy or growth inhibition
    in the MCF-7 cell line., These results indicated that inhibition of mTOR was not
    a contributing mechanism in execution of BITC-induced autophagy., "(A) Immunoblotting

    of autophagy induction by H2O2 and serum starvation ., This study also showed
    that autophagy was associated with acetylation of FoxO1 leading to its increased
    interaction with Atg7 ., We proceeded to test possible involvement of FoxO1 in
    autophagy induction in our model., The level of total and acetylated FoxO1 was
    increased modestly in BITC-treated MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells., 'In addition,
    the BITC treatment resulted in increased interaction between acetylated FoxO1
    and Atg7 as revealed by an experiment involving immunoprecipitation of acetylated
    FoxO1 followed by immunoblotting with the use of anti-Atg7 antibody.', The BITC-mediated
    increase in total FoxO1 protein level was evident in MDA-MB-231 xenografts in
    Western blotting as well as immunohistochemical experiments., These results indicated
    induction and increased acetylation of FoxO1 in breast cancer cells upon treatment

    with these results, RNA interference of FoxO1 conferred significant protection

    was done twice with similar results, and representative data from one such experiment
    are shown.', The present study shows that BITC treatment causes autophagy in breast
    cancer cells that is not influenced by the estrogen receptor expression., Recent
    studies point towards an important role of cytoplasmic p53 in regulation of autophagy
    ., The p53 status has no obvious impact on BITC-induced autophagy because this
    response is observed in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells., 'Autophagic response
    to BITC is not restricted to cultured breast cancer cells as MDA-MB-231 xenografts
    from the BITC-treated mice exhibit features characteristic of autophagy, including
    cleavage of LC3 and suppression of p62 expression.', 'Autophagy induction by some
    stimuli contributes to drug resistance in cancer cells , .', 'For example, inhibition
    of autophagy by chloroquine augments activity of the alkylating agent cyclophosphamide
    in a Myc-driven model of lymphoma .', 'We have also shown previously that D,L-sulforaphane,

    MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells ., 'Furthermore, prooxidant as well as proapoptotic
    effects of BITC in these cells are significantly attenuated by ectopic expression
    of catalase and SOD .', The present study reveals that autophagic response to
    BITC in breast cancer cells is partially dependent on ROS production., Suppression
    of ROS production through stable overexpression of Mn-SOD confers partial protection
    against BITC-induced autophagy., 'However, additional work is needed to test whether
    ROS-dependent autophagy by BITC involves upregulation of Beclin 1, Atg4 oxidation,
    or any other mechanism.', 'Initially we focused on mTOR, which negatively regulates
    autophagy in yeast and mammals , to gain insight into the mechanism of BITC-induced
    autophagy.', 'Even though BITC treatment inhibits mTOR activity as evidenced by
    a reduction in phosphorylation of its downstream targets, autophagic response
    to BITC is not attenuated by activation of mTOR through overexpression of its
    positive regulator Rheb in either MDA-MB-231 or MCF-7 cells.', 'To our surprise,
    Rheb-mediated activation of mTOR fails to confer any protection against cell killing

    activity but accompanied by acetylation leading to increased binding with Atg7
    ., We reasoned that autophagic response to BITC might be mediated by FoxO1., 'Indeed,
    we observed that BITC treatment causes modest induction as well as increased acetylation
    of FoxO1 in both MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells.', 'Moreover, the BITC-mediated acetylation
    of FoxO1 promotes its interaction with Atg7 in both cells as evidenced by immunoprecipitation-immunoblotting
    assay.', 'Because BITC-induced autophagy as well as cell growth inhibition is
    significantly attenuated by knockdown of FoxO1, we conclude that this protein
    plays a critical role in autophagic cell death by BITC treatment in human breast
    cancer cells.', 'In conclusion, the present study shows that BITC treatment causes
    FoxO1-mediated autophagic cell death in breast cancer cells, which is neither
    a cell-line specific phenomenon nor affected by the estrogen receptor or p53 status.',
