['Background: This study aimed to examine the effect of apigenin on proliferation
    and apoptosis in HER2-overexpressing MDA-MB-453 breast cancer cells.', 'Materials
    and Methods: The antiproliferative effects of apigenin were examined by proliferation
    and MTT assays.', The effect of apigenin on apoptotic molecules was determined
    by western blotting., "RT-PCR was performed to measure mRNA levels of HIF-1\u03B1
    and VEGF.", ELISA assay was performed to measure intracellular VEGF levels., Immunocytochemistry
    was performed to evaluate nuclear STAT3 level., 'Results: Apigenin inhibited the
    proliferation of MDA-MB-453 cells.', 'Apigenin up-regulated the levels of cleaved
    caspase-8 and caspase-3, and induced the cleavage of PARP.', Apigenin induced
    extrinsic apoptosis and blocked the activation of JAK2 and STAT3., Apigenin inhibited
    CoCl2-induced VEGF secretion and decreased the nuclear staining of STAT3., 'Conclusion:
    Apigenin exerts its antiproliferative activity by inhibiting STAT3 signaling.',
  Apigenin could serve as a useful compound to prevent or treat HER2-overexpressing
    breast cancer., Cancer prevention/treatment through food may be largely feasible
    by increased consumption of fruits and vegetables., Considerable efforts have
    been put to identify plant-derived dietary agents which could prevent or treat
    cancer., 'A naturally-occurring plant flavone,, apigenin abundantly presents in
    common fruits and vegetables including parsley, onions, oranges, tea, chamomile,
    wheat sprouts and some seasonings.', 'Apigenin is known to exert anti-oxidant,
    anti-inflammatory, anti-telomerase, and anti-depressant activities.', 'Notably,
    apigenin also possesses antitumor properties and, therefore, has special interest
    for the development of a novel chemopreventive and/or chemotherapeutic agents.',
  It was previously demonstrated that apigenin reduces the tumor volume and mass of
    androgen-sensitive 22Rv1 and androgen-insensitive PC-3-implanted cells., Apigenin
    also suppresses inducible cyclooxygenase and inducible nitric oxide synthase in
    mouse macrophages and inhibits ultraviolet light-induced skin carcinogenesis in
    SKH-1 mice., 'In addition, apigenin induces growth inhibition and apoptosis in
    a variety of cancer cell lines, including breast, lung, colon, prostate, leukemia,
    and pancreatic cells.', 'Apoptosis plays an important role in determining cellular
    fate; it participates in development, cellular homeostasis, and both physiological
    as well as pathological processes.', "Caspases are aspartate-specific cysteine
    proteases and members of the interleukin-1\u03B2-converting enzyme family and
    essential in cells for apoptosis.", 'The caspase cascade system plays vital roles
    in the induction, transduction and amplification of intracellular apoptotic signals.',
  'The apoptotic-signaling cascade is divided into two major pathways, extrinsic and
    intrinsic.', 'The extrinsic pathway is related to the activation of death receptors,
    such as Fas and the tumor necrosis factor receptors and the cleavage of caspase-8
    and caspase-3.', 'The intrinsic pathway is related to changes in the mitochondrial
    membrane potential, the mitochondrial permeability transition, and the cleavage
    of caspase-9 and caspase-3.', 'In both the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways, caspase-3
    is responsible for the cleavage of poly polymerase during cell death.', Human
    epidermal growth factor receptor-2-positive breast cancers tend to grow more quickly
    than HER2-negative breast cancers., 'In HER2-positive breast cancers, hormonal
    receptors expression is associated with a poor prognosis despite the hormone therapy.',
  HER2 amplification or overexpression is a risk factor for recurrence., Between 15
    and 25 out of every 100 women with breast cancer have HER2-positive cancers.,
  Effective treatments called targeted therapies have been developed to treat HER2-positive
    breast cancer., The drug most commonly used is trastuzumab., 'Trastuzumab induces
    the down-regulation of HER-2/Neu, leading to the disruption of receptor dimerization
    and signaling.', 'Trastuzumab also causes arrests during G1 phase of the cell
    cycle and inhibits the phosphorylation of p27Kip1, resulting in the suppression
    of cdk2 activity and reduced proliferation.', Trastuzumab suppresses angiogenesis
    by both the induction of anti-angiogenic factors and the repression of pro-angiogenic
    factors., 'However, many women do not respond to trastuzumab or develop resistance
    to this drug.', This has resulted in significant efforts to identify other compounds
    that can effectively treat HER-2-overexpressing breast cancer., 'Previously, we
    reported that genistein and quercetin induce apoptosis via the extrinsic pathway
    inhibiting nuclear factor-kappa B signaling in HER2-transfected MCF-7 cells.',
  "We also reported that apigenin promotes apoptosis via the extrinsic pathway, inducing
    p53 and inhibiting signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 and NF-\u03BAB
    signaling in HER-2-transfected MCF-7 cells.", 'In the present study, we investigated
    whether apigenin produces apoptosis-inducing cleavage of caspases and PARP and
    regulating STAT3 signaling.', We also investigated whether apigenin regulates
    the levels of VEGF which is a STAT3 target gene., Our study will provide new insight
    on the role of phytoestrogens in the prevention or treatment of HER2-overxpressing

    the growth of MDA-MB-453 cells., We investigated the growth suppressive activity
    of three different phytoestrogens in MDA-MB-453 cells using a cell proliferation
    assay., 'As shown in Figure 1A, apigenin, genistein and quercetin significantly
    inhibited MDA-MB-453 cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner after 72 h
    of treatment.', 'In addition, the time-dependent growth suppressive activity of
    apigenin was measured by the MTT assay, as shown in Figure 1B.', 'It seems that
    the proliferation assay was more sensitive than the MTT assay with respect to
    measuring the intensity of the cell growth inhibition, as shown in Figure 1A and
    1B.', 'Moreover, the growth inhibition induced by apigenin was verified by microscopic
    observation.', The results in Figure 1C show that apigenin effectively inhibited
    the growth rate of MDA-MB-453 monolayer cells after 72 h of treatment., 'Of note,
    apigenin also induced morphological changes in these cells.', The growth-suppressive
    activity of apigenin is accompanied by an increase in the subG0/G1 apoptotic population
    in MDA-MB-453 cells., 'To investigate whether apigenin inhibits cell proliferation
    by promoting changes in cell-cycle progression, the effect of apigenin on the
    cell-cycle profile was assessed in MDA-MB-453 cells.', 'For this purpose, cells
    were treated with apigenin for 72 h and then analyzed for cell-cycle stage by
    flow cytometry.', The results demonstrated that apigenin induced an increase in
    the sub G0/G1 apoptotic population in MDA-MB-453 cells., Apigenin induces apoptosis
    via a caspase-dependent pathway in MDA-MB-453 cells., 'In this step, we investigated
    whether apigenin activates caspase-dependent apoptosis by measuring the expression
    of caspase-8, caspase-3, and PARP.', 'We observed that apigenin up-regulated the
    levels of cleaved caspase-8 and caspase-3, and induced the cleavage of PARP in
    SKBR3 cells.', 'We also found that the cleavage of caspase-8, caspase-3, and PARP
    was inhibited by the caspase-8 inhibitor Z-IETD-fmk and the caspase-9 inhibitor
    Z-LEHD-fmk, but apigenin prevented this inhibition and was able to induce the
    cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP in the presence of Z-IETD-fmk and Z-LEHD-fmk.',
  'Moreover, the caspase-8 and caspase-9 inhibitors did not suppress cell growth,
    but apigenin was able to induce apoptosis even in their presence.', These results
    confirm that apigenin strongly promotes apoptosis via a caspase-dependent mechanism.,
  Effect of apigenin on MDA-MB-453 cell growth., 'MDA-MB-453 cells were treated with
    different doses of apigenin, genistein and quercetin.', 'After 72 h, cell viability
    was assessed using a cell proliferation assay.', MDA-MB-453 cells were treated
    with different doses of apigenin., 'The relative cell growth rate was measured
    by the MTT assay after 24 h, 48 h and 72 h. The growth rate of the vehicle-treated
    cells was set to 100%, and the relative decrease in cell viability resulting from
    the phytoestrogen treatment was expressed as a percentage of the control.', MDA-MB-453

    we investigated whether apoptosis induced by apigenin occurs via the extrinsic
    apoptosis pathway in MDA-MB-453 cells.', 'For this purpose, we measured the levels
    of BCL2 family members which are important in non-extrinsic apoptosis pathway.',
  'We found that apigenin failed to regulate the levels of BAX, Bcl-2, and Bcl-XL
    in MDA-MB-453 cells as seen in Figure 4A and 4B.', We also measured the loss of
    mitochondrial transmembrane potential using JC-1., JC-1 is able to selectively
    enter mitochondria and reversibly-transforms color from red to green when the
    membrane potential decreases., "In non-apoptotic cells with high mitochondrial
    \u0394\u03A8m, JC-1 spontaneously forms complexes known as J-aggregates with intense
    red fluorescence.", "On the other hand, in apoptotic cells with low \u0394\u03A8m,
    JC-1 remains in the monomeric form, which shows only green fluorescence.", 'In
    our study, apigenin did not induce a low mitochondrial transmembrane potential,
    showing relatively weak green fluorescence as compared to FCCP.', These results
    demonstrate that apigenin does not induce apoptosis via the intrinsic mitochondrial
    pathway but induces apoptosis via the extrinsic pathway in MDA-MB-453 cells.,

    gave similar results., Effect of apigenin on STAT3 activation in MDA-MB-453 cells.,
  Figure 5A shows that MDA-MB-453 cells express HER2 and apigenin slightly up-regulates
    phospho-p53 and p21., 'In Figure 5(B), we investigated whether apigenin affects
    STAT3 signaling by measuring levels of p-STAT3 and VEGF.', We found that apigenin
    reduced the expression of p-STAT3 as well as p-JAK2., Apigenin also reduced the
    level of VEGF., "Since STAT3 is a potential modulator of HIF-1\u03B1, we observed
    the relationship between STAT3 and HIF-1\u03B1.", "We found that apigenin suppressed
    the expression of p-STAT3 and Hif-1\u03B1 that was up-regulated by CoCl2.", Immunocytochemical
    staining indicated that apigenin decreased the nuclear localization of STAT3 in
    the presence and absence of CoCl2., "As seen in Figure 6A, apigenin decreased
    mRNA levels of HIF-1\u03B1 and VEGF that was slightly up-regulated by CoCl2.",
  'Moreover, apigenin strongly decreased the CoCl2-induced up-regulation of intracellular
    VEGF.', These results suggest that apigenin decreases the cell growth rate by
    inhibiting the JAK2-STAT3-VEGF signaling pathway., Effect of the STAT3 inhibitor
    S31-201 on the growth of MDA-MB-453 cells., MDA-MB-453 cells were treated with

    on STAT3 activation in MDA-MB-453 cells., 'Finally, we investigated whether the
    STAT3 inhibitor S31-201 inhibits cell proliferation and STAT3 activation in MDA-MB-453
    cells.', 'As shown in Figure 7A and B, S31-201 decreased cell growth in a dose-
    and time-dependent manner.', 'Furthermore, S31-201 reduced the expression of p-STAT3
    and VEGF.', These results demonstrate that STAT3 inhibition induces cell growth
    inhibition and represses the expression of oncogenic molecules., 'In the present
    study, we investigated the anti-proliferative activity of apigenin and its mechanisms
    of action in HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells.', Apigenin suppressed the
    growth of MDA-MB-453 cells in a dose- and time- dependent manner., The growth
    inhibition induced by apigenin was related to an increase in the sub-G0/G1 apoptotic
    population in MDA-MB-453 cells., 'Apigenin increased the number of apoptotic cells
    in a dose-dependent manner, as assessed by FACS analysis.', 'Interestingly, apigenin
    induced apoptosis via a caspase-dependent pathway by enhancing the cleavage of
    caspase-8, caspase-3, and PARP.', 'To confirm whether the apoptosis induced by
    apigenin occurs via a caspase-8-, and caspase-3-dependent pathway, we treated
    MDA-MB-453 cells with the caspase-8 inhibitor Z-IETD-fmk and the caspase-9 inhibitor
    Z-LEHD-fmk and performed western blot analysis.', 'We found that the cleavage
    of caspase-8, caspase-3, and PARP was inhibited by the caspase-8 and caspase-9
    inhibitors.', 'However, this inhibition was abrogated by apigenin, suggesting
    that this phytochemical contains a strong apoptotic capacity.', 'The caspases,
    a family of cysteine-dependent aspartate-directed proteases, are common death
    proteases.', Caspases are synthesized as relatively inactive zymogens that become
    activated by scaffold-mediated transactivation or by cleavage via upstream proteases
    in an intracellular cascade., 'Once activated, they cleave a variety of intracellular
    polypeptides, including major structural elements of the cytoplasm and nucleus,
    components of the DNA repair machinery, and a number of protein kinases.', 'It
    should be noted that apigenin did not induce apoptosis via the intrinsic mitochondrial
    apoptosis pathway since this compound did not reduce the mitochondrial membrane
    potential, maintaining red flouorescence, and did not affect the levels of Bcl-2
    and BAX.', BCL2 family includes both anti-apoptotic proteins and pro-apoptotic
    proteins., All BCL2 members possess at least one of four conserved motifs known
    as BCL2 homology domains., Pro- and anti-apoptotic family members can heterodimerize
    and regulate each others functions; their relative concentration may be important
    in modulating apoptosis., 'On the other hand, apigenin induced the extrinsic apoptosis
    pathway: apigenin activated death receptor-related apoptosis signaling, enhancing
    the cleavage of caspase-8, caspase-3 and PARP.', 'Our western blot data also indicated
    that apigenin slightly increased the expression of p53, active p53 and p21, suggesting
    that this compound suppresses HER2-overexpressing cancer cell growth via a p53-dependent
    manner.', 'In agreement with our data, apigenin has been shown to induce G1 or
    G2/M arrest and apoptosis in human prostate carcinoma cells, human cervical carcinoma
    cells, and human hepatoma cells through a p53-dependent manner.', 'The p53 tumor
    suppressor inhibits cellular proliferation by inducing cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis
    in response to cellular stresses including DNA damage, growth factor deprivation,
    hypoxia, and oncogene activation.', 'p53-dependent apoptosis is produced by the
    caspase proteinases and is related to pro-apoptotic proteins such as BAX, NOXA
    and PUMA.', 'Interestingly, apigenin reduced the expression of p-STAT3 and p-JAK2
    in MDA-MB-453 cells.', 'The VEGF promoter contains various transcription factor
    binding sites, including sites for STAT3 and HIF-1.', The physical interaction
    of STAT3 with HIF-1 controls VEGF transcriptional activation by their binding
    to the VEGF promoter., 'In our study, we found that apigenin inhibited VEGF expression/production
    as well as STAT3 expression/nuclear localization in the presence or absence of
    CoCl2.', The STAT3 inhibitor S31-201 decreased the expression of p-STAT3 and VEGF.,
  'In our experiments, culturing of MDA-MB-453 cells under conditions that mimicked
    hypoxia or normoxia did not induce the expression or activation of MMP-2 or MMP-9,
    as indicated in a previous report.', The co-culture of MDA-MB-453 with another
    cell line or tumor-associated macrophages induces the expression and activation
    of MMP-2 and MMP-9., Our data clearly demonstrate that apigenin suppresses cell
    growth by inhibiting the STAT3-VEGF signaling pathway in MDA-MB-453 cells., STAT3
    is a transcription factor that regulates the gene expression in response to various
    cellular stimuli and plays an important role in cell growth and apoptosis., 'STAT3
    usually acts as a tumor promoter, although its role as a tumor-suppressor has
    been recently reported.', 'STAT3 accelerates cell proliferation and angiogenesis,
    inhibits apoptosis, and drives invasion and metastasis.', STAT3 in melanoma tumors
    is associated with poor prognosis., Constitutive STAT3 phosphorylation is mediated
    by several upstream kinases and is thought to be a key component of the oncogenic
    process., Another phytoestrogen is known to inhibit STAT3 signaling and induces
    the apoptosis of malignant cells containing activated STAT3., Approximately 20-25%
    of invasive breast carcinomas show HER2 overexpression., 'A normal breast cell
    has 20,000 HER2 receptors, but a breast cancer cell could have up to 1.5 million.',
  'HER2 is a member of the HER/ErbB2/Neu protein family, which also includes HER1/EGFR,
    HER3 and HER4.', 'HER2 cross-talks with the estrogen receptor signal transduction
    pathway, and its expression levels can be regulated by ER.', 'In our study, we
    found that apigenin significantly inhibited the growth of HER2-overexpressing
    cancer cells.', This indicates that apigenin could be a useful natural therapy
    that inhibits HER2-overexpressing breast cancer., Apigenin could be a promising
    target for the treatment and prevention of HER2-overexpressing breast cancer.,
