["Fish mercury concentrations have been measured over the last 30\u201340 years in
    all regions of Canada as part of various monitoring and research programs.", 'Despite
    this large amount of data, only regional assessments of fish Hg trends and patterns
    have previously been attempted.', The objective of this study was to assemble
    available freshwater fish Hg concentration data from all provinces and territories
    and identify national patterns., The Canadian Fish Mercury Database includes over
    330 000 records representing 104 species of freshwater fish collected from over
    5000 locations across Canada between 1967 and 2010., Analysis of the 28 most frequently
    occurring species showed that the majority of variation in Hg concentrations was
    accounted for by geographic location., 'Median Hg concentrations increased with
    trophic level, with the highest Hg concentrations found in piscivorous species
    such as walleye, northern pike, and lake trout.', 'The Canadian Fish Mercury Database
    provides the most comprehensive summary of fish Hg measurements in Canada, and
    the results indicate that several regionally observed trends in fish Hg concentrations
    are observed at a national scale.', Implications for the effective assessment
    of changes in fish Hg concentrations in relation to changes in Hg emission regulations
    are discussed.]
