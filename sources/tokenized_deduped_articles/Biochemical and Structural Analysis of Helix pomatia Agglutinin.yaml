[Helix pomatia agglutinin is a N-acetylgalactosamine binding lectin found in the albumen
    gland of the roman snail., 'As a constituent of perivitelline fluid, HPA protects
    fertilized eggs from bacteria and is part of the innate immunity system of the
    snail.', The peptide sequence deduced from gene cloning demonstrates that HPA
    belongs to a family of carbohydrate-binding proteins recently identified in several
    invertebrates., This domain is also present in discoidin from the slime mold Dictyostelium
    discoideum., 'Investigation of the lectin specificity was performed with the use
    of glycan arrays, demonstrating that several GalNAc-containing oligosaccharides
    are bound and rationalizing the use of this lectin as a cancer marker.', "Titration
    microcalorimetry performed on the interaction between HPA and GalNAc indicates
    an affinity in the 10\u20134 m range with an enthalpy-driven binding mechanism.",
  "The crystal structure of HPA demonstrates the occurrence of a new \u03B2-sandwich
    lectin fold.", The hexameric quaternary state was never observed previously for
    a lectin., "The high resolution structure complex of HPA with GalNAc characterizes
    a new carbohydrate binding site and rationalizes the observed preference for \u03B1GalNAc-containing
    oligosaccharides."]
