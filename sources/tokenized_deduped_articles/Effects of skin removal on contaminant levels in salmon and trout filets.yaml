[Skin removal is a generally accepted method to reduce exposure to contaminants through
    fish consumption., 'However, inconsistent results from studies on the effectiveness
    of this method suggest influence of other factors such as characteristics of contaminants
    and fish species.', "This study investigated the effects of skin removal on the
    lipid contents and concentrations of total mercury, \xCE\xB1-chlordane, hexachlorobenzene,
    mirex, octachlorosytrene, polychlorinated biphenyls, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane,
    dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane, and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene.", 'Four
    fish species namely brown trout, Chinook salmon, coho salmon and rainbow trout
    sampled from the Credit River, Ontario, Canada were considered.', 'Concentrations
    of all the lipophilic organic contaminants decreased significantly after removing
    skins from filets of brown trout, Chinook salmon and coho salmon, but not of rainbow
    trout.', 'In contrast, the concentrations of mercury tended to be either similar
    or marginally higher after removing skins from filets of all four species; however,
    the amount of mercury would have likely declined or remained unchanged.', 'Overall,
    removal of skin before consuming a fish filet is recommended to reduce exposure
    to contaminants widely found in Ontario fish.']
