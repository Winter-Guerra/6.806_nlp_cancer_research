['Sweet basil, Ocimum basilicum, is one of the most important and wildly used spices
    and has been shown to have antioxidant, antibacterial, and anti-diarrheal activities.',
  'In this study, high performance liquid chromatographic and flow-injection mass
    spectrometric fingerprinting techniques were used to differentiate organic and
    conventional sweet basil leaf samples.', Principal component analysis of the fingerprints
    indicated that both HPLC and FIMS fingerprints could effectively detect the chemical
    differences in the organic and conventional sweet basil leaf samples., This study
    suggested that the organic basil sample contained greater concentrations of almost
    all the major compounds than its conventional counterpart on a per same botanical
    weight basis., 'The FIMS method was able to rapidly differentiate the organic
    and conventional sweet basil leaf samples, whereas the HPLC fingerprints provided
    more information about the chemical composition of the basil samples with a longer
    analytical time.']
