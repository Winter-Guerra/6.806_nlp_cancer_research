["Phytochemical investigation of the leaves of Ribes nigrum resulted in the isolation
    of fourteen compounds, including four 7,7\u2032-epoxylignans, three tetrahydrofuran-type
    sesquilignans, and a spirocyclic dilignan.", Their structures were elucidated
    by extensive spectroscopic analyses and by chemical transformations., The isolated
    compounds were evaluated for their antioxidant activities using superoxide anion
    scavenging assay and DPPH free radical scavenging assay., "Ribesin D and ribesin
    G showed the most potent superoxide anion scavenging activity with EC50 values
    of 1.24 and 1.12 \xCE\xBCM, respectively, and the structure-activity relationship
    was discussed."]
