    are proteins or glycoproteins of nonimmune origin that agglutinate cells and precipitate
    complex carbohydrates.", Lectins of both plant and animal origin have been widely
    used to map cell surface carbohydrates and to observe changes occurring during
    malignant transformation and development., An array of biological functions is
    attributed to the binding of lectins to the cell surface sugars., 'The lectins
    are thus reckoned with the functions such as tumor cell recognition, cell adhesion,
    localization, signal transduction across the membrane, mitogenic stimulation,
    potentiation of host immune defense, cytotoxicity, and apoptosis.', 'Lectins derived
    from Helix sp., Limax sp., Achatina sp., and their binding to different groups
    of carbohydrates and their prognostic properties to bind the metastatic cells
    preferentially have been demonstrated in recent studies.', Lectins or lectin-like
    proteins endowed with the ability to bind sialoglycoconjugates have been used
    as recognition molecules to predict changes in the pattern of sialylation and
    the degree of O-acetylation during malignant transformation., It is very crucial
    to identify the reliable markers of metastatic potentials in the development of
    cancer therapeutics., Several screening protocols may help evaluate the prognostic
    properties of lectins., 'In the present study, the cytotoxic effects of hemolymph
    derived achatininH from Achatina fulica and its binding properties to the breast
    cancer cell line MCF7 have been delineated using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
    bromide assay, immunocytochemistry, and flowcytometry.', It is known that MTT
    is an established technique to estimate the in vitro cellular viability in the
    disease-oriented screening protocols in cancer research., 'The MTT assay is based
    on the fact that only viable cells reduce tetrazolium salts to colored formazan,
    which can be quantitated spectrophotometrically.', 'Besides measuring viability,
    activation, and proliferation, the MTT assay has also been recently adopted to
    measure the clonogenesity of cancer cells in culture system.', The specific binding
    of achatininH to MCF7 cells observed in our study would provide a viable prognostic
    marker in tumor cell detection., We have also observed that the increased expression
    of lactate dehydrogenase by tumor cells could be suppressed by achatininH treatment.,

    The flowcytometry-based assay exhibited the changes in cell cycle on treatment
    with achatininH.', 'The percentage of cells in S phase after exposure to IC50
    of achatininH was 12%, while it was 36% in untreated cells.', 'However, after
    48 h, the G2/M peak declined in the treated MCF7 cells conspicuously.', 'In the
    untreated cells, the percentage of cells in G2/M phase was 18%.', 'The process
    of cell division has been halted, as indicated by the presence of only 9% cells
    in G2/M phase.', 'It is also observed that 32% of the cells have entered the apoptotic
    phase, while it was 6% in untreated cells, indicating DNA damage.', FACs analysis
    of DNA control MCF7 cells and achatininH-treated MCF7 cells., DNA isolated from
    the achatininH-treated cells was electrophoresed on a 2% agarose gel to quantify
    DNA damage., 'Figure 7 is the electrophoretic profile of DNA, as evidenced by
    ethidium bromide staining.', 'Lane 1 is the DNA ladder, lane 2 is the DNA sample
    from 24-h achatininH-treated cells, lane 3 is the DNA sample from 48-h achatininH-treated
    cells, and lane 4 is the control MCF7 cells.', The DNA damage in lanes 2 and 3
    is nearly the same thus signifying that 24 h is sufficient for achatininH to bring
    about damage of cellular DNA., 'Agarose gel electrophoresis of DNA isolated from
    MCF7 treated with achatininH for 24 h, MCF7 treated with achatininH for 48 h,
    and control.', DNA ladder., 'In this study, achatininH-mediated cytotoxicity is
    described with respect to human mammary carcinoma cell line MCF7.', "Excellent
    linearity could be observed in the MTT assay between cell number and absorbance
    up to 3 \xD7 105 cells/well.", "Reduction in cell proliferation was observed at
    a concentration of 6 \u03BCg of achatininH.", "At 8 \u03BCg/ml concentration,
    the MTT assay showed 55% cell death, whereas by cell count method the cell death
    observed was 62%.", This small difference may be due to a reduced sensitivity
    by MTT., The MTT assay depends both on the number of cells present and on the
    mitochondrial activity per cell., Earlier studies by Baker et al., 'demonstrated
    that concanavalinA-activated T-cells produced much less formazan than EL4, and
    in our study, achatininH-bound cells produced less formazan.', 'The viability
    of MCF7 cells was affected in the presence of achatininH, as it induced cytotoxicity
    in these cells.', 'The cytotoxic action of achatininH on MCF7 cells is of interest,
    due to the selective killing of only transformed cells.', AchatininH had no effect
    on normal human fibroblasts even at high doses., 'Similarly, the cytotoxicity
    of lectins derived from other molluscan species has been demonstrated with other
    types of cancer cell lines..', 'In the present study, the effect of achatininH
    on MCF7 cells showed increase in LPO indicating activation of the free radical
    scavenging enzymes such as SOD and CAT.', 'The increase in CAT activity in achatininH-treated
    MCF7 cells indicates that the treatment may help to lower H2O2 concentration by
    its decomposition and, hence, reduce oxidative stress.', The SOD activity decreased
    with achatininH treatment., 'It may be construed that the altered antioxidants
    and enzyme activity may lower the cAMP concentration and decrease subsequent reduction
    of deoxyribonucleotides for DNA synthesis, which is a crucial step in neoplastic
    growth and tumorigenesis.', 'In the present study, the LDH, acid and alkaline
    phosphatase, and alanine aminotransferase activities also significantly decreased
    in the treated MCF7 cells compared to control.', LDH is a tetrameric enzyme and
    is recognized as a potential tumor marker in assessing the progression of the
    proliferating malignant cells., 'The elevated activity of LDH may be due to its
    overproduction by tumor cells, or it may be due to the release of isoenzymes from
    destroyed tissues.', 'Recent studies also showed that LDH activity in the serum
    of DLA mice was elevated about 14-fold, and treatment with queuine decreased the
    activity significantly up to fourfold.', The achatininH-caused antimitotic effect
    on cancer cells is evident in the cell cycle studies with MCF7 cells., Flow cytometry
    is one of the most powerful and specific methods for the integrated study of molecular
    and morphological events occurring during cell death and cell proliferation and
    measures the total amount of DNA in cells., 'FACS analysis of DNA from untreated
    cells and DNA from achatininH-treated cells was carried out, and Fig.', 6 a and
    b exhibit similar results., 'MCF7 cells were blocked at S-phase after lectin treatment,
    and the percentage of cells in S-phase was 12%, whereas in untreated cells it
    was 36% after exposure for 48 h. A previous report indicated that 2-methoxyestradiol
    treatment of the estrogen-dependent cell line caused G2/M arrest associated with
    the depolymerization of tubulin.', A lower percentage of MCF7 cells in S-phase
    and a lower percentage in G2/M than the controls is depicted in Fig., '6.', 'In
    S-phase, cell death was observed after 48 h of achatininH exposure, which produces
    a low cell count in G2/M phase.', "It may be inferred from the above results that,
    although lectin binds to the receptor domains on the cell\u2019s surface, the
    signal transduction occurs even in S-phase.", "One of the major significant observations
    is the arrest in G2\u2013M phase, which is considered to be the major checkpoint
    of the cell cycle.", Appearance of the sub-G1 peak is characteristic of apoptotic
    cells., The extent of apoptosis is quantified by the formation of the typical
    DNA ladder., Figure 7 is an electrophoretogram of DNA isolated from control and
    achatininH-treated MCF7 cells., Lanes 2 and 3 represent DNA isolated from cells
    treated with achatininH for different time periods., Some cells are known to show
    apparent morphological induction of apoptosis in the absence of oligonucleosomal
    DNA fragmentation as a late event in the apoptotic process., There are some reports
    of MCF7 cells producing a DNA ladder but others have demonstrated that MCF7 cells
    do not undergo apoptotic DNA fragmentation., 'In an attempt to clarify this conflicting
    information, Gooch and Yee demonstrated that the ability of MCF7 cells to undergo
    DNA laddering appears to be strain-specific.', 'Taking cue from the above observations
    and reports, the present scenario signifies that achatininH is very potent in
    inducing cellular damage as reflected by variation in total DNA content.', The
    finding also suggests that achatininH may offer therapeutic utility as a new type
    of anticancer agent as it selectively inhibited mitosis in the fast-growing malignant
    cells., The ligand-binding function of achatininH as a homing molecule and molecular
    probe and the complement-mediated cell lysis of lectins have already been established.,
