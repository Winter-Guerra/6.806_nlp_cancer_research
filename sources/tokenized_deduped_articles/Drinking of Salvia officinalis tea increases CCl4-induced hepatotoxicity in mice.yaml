['In a previous study, the drinking of a Salvia officinalis tea for 14 days improved
    liver antioxidant status in mice and rats where, among other factors, an enhancement
    of glutathione-S-transferase activity was observed.', 'Taking in consideration
    these effects, in the present study the potential protective effects of sage tea
    drinking against a situation of hepatotoxicity due to free radical formation,
    such as that caused by carbon tetrachloride, were evaluated in mice of both genders.',
  'Contrary to what was expected, sage tea drinking significantly increased the CCl4-induced
    liver injury, as seen by increased plasma transaminase levels and histology liver
    damage.', 'In accordance with the previous study, sage tea drinking enhanced significantly
    GST activity.', 'Additionally, glutathione peroxidase was also significantly increased
    by sage tea drinking.', 'Since CCl4 toxicity results from its bioactivation mainly
    by cytochrome P450 2E1, the expression level of this protein was measured by Western
    Blot.', 'An increase in CYP 2E1 protein was observed which may explain, at least
    in part, the potentiation of CCl4-induced hepatotoxicity conferred by sage tea
    drinking.', The CCl4-induced hepatotoxicity was higher in females than males.,
  'In conclusion, our results indicate that, although sage tea did not have toxic
    effects of its own, herb-drug interactions are possible and may affect the efficacy
    and safety of concurrent medical therapy with drugs that are metabolized by phase
    I enzymes.']
