[The survival rate for breast cancer drops dramatically once the disease progresses
    to the metastatic stage., Selenium is an essential micronutrient credited with
    having high anticancer and chemopreventive properties., 'In our study, we investigated
    if dietary Se supplementation modified breast cancer development in vivo.', 'Three
    diets supplemented with sodium selenite, methylseleninic acid or selenomethionine,
    as well as a Se-deficient and a Se-adequate diet were fed to mice before mammary
    gland inoculation of 4T1.2 cells.', 'The primary tumor growth, the numbers of
    cancer cells present in lungs, hearts, livers, kidneys and femurs and several
    proinflammatory cytokines were measured.', 'We found that inorganic selenite supplementation
    provided only short-term delay of tumor growth, whereas the two organic SeMet
    and MSA supplements provided more potent growth inhibition.', These diets also
    affected cancer metastasis differently., Mice fed selenite developed the most
    extensive metastasis and had an increased incidence of kidney and bone metastasis.,
  'On the other hand, mice fed the SeMet diet showed the least amount of cancer growth
    at metastatic sites.', The MSA diet also provided some protection against breast
    cancer metastasis although the effects were less significant than those of SeMet.,
  "The cytokine profiles indicated that serum levels of interlukin-2, interleukin-6,
    interferon \u03B3 and vascular endothelial growth factor were elevated in SeMet-supplemented
    mice.", There was no significant difference in tumor growth and the patterns of
    metastasis between the Se-deficient and Se-adequate groups., 'Our data suggest
    that organic Se supplementation may reduce/delay breast cancer metastasis, while
    selenite may exacerbate it.', Breast cancer is the second highest cause of cancer
    death among women following lung and bronchial cancer., 'After breast cancer metastasizes
    to secondary organs, the 5-year survival rate drops dramatically.', 'Because of
    the strong association between metastasis and poor prognosis, much effort has
    been focused on early detection.', Circulating tumor cells have been used as an
    early indicator of metastasis., Their presence indicates that metastasis may occur
    earlier than detectable clinical symptoms., These CTCs or disseminated tumor cells
    in the bone may remain dormant for years., These findings illustrate the difficulty
    in determining when metastasis occurs and how to prevent it., One approach may
    be to use a dietary supplement as a preventive treatment., 'Selenium is a micronutrient
    important to human health, primarily through antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and
    antiviral mechanisms.', Se compounds and selenoproteins are thought to have important
    anticancer activity and chemopreventive properties., "Organic Se is present in
    foods in the forms of selenomethionine, selenocysteine, \u03B3-glutamyl-Se-methyl-selenocysteine
    and Se-methylselenocysteine, while inorganic Se is usually found as selenate or
    selenite in the soil.", 'Cellular glutathione is essential for the conversion
    of inorganic Se to selenide, a precursor of selenophosphate.', "Besides, some
    organic Se compounds, including SeMet, \u03B3-glutamyl-Se-methyl-selenocysteine
    and Se-methylselenocysteine, are able to form methylselenol.", "When cells generate
    too much selenide, it can react with oxygen to produce toxic O2\u2212.", It is
    well accepted that methylselenol is involved in the anticancer properties of Se.,
  'In our study, we used several Se compounds to determine their suitability as antimetastatic
    agents.', 'For decades, epidemiological and preclinical evidence supported the
    belief that a higher dietary intake of Se decreases the incidence and alter biological
    behaviors of several types of cancers.', 'Generally, Se has been shown to prevent
    or to express anticancer activity.', The results of the majority of animal studies
    indicate that the preventive properties of Se occur at supranutritional levels.,
  'It is believed that the active Se metabolite is a monomethylated Se species, such
    as methylselenol.', 'The chemoprevention efficacy of any given Se compound may
    rely on how efficiently it can be converted to this active Se pool, including
    the synthesis of selenoproteins.', 'In addition to Se compounds, the involvement
    of selenoproteins in cancer progression has also been noted.', 'For example, the
    genetic variants and the allelic loss of glutathione peroxidase-1 or selenoprotein
    15 have been linked with breast cancer.', 'Other mechanisms of prevention by Se
    may be via the regulation of redox-active proteins, controlling the redox status
    of proteins, maintaining intracellular redox balance, monitoring inflammatory
    and immune responses, enhancing DNA stability, causing cell cycle arrest, promoting
    apoptosis, blocking cancer cell invasion and migration, inhibiting angiogenesis,
    controlling crucial regulatory proteins of cell growth and promoting phase II
    carcinogen-detoxifying enzymes.', 'In addition to chemoprevention, Se may be used
    in cancer therapy.', Organic and inorganic Se compounds can induce apoptosis in
    cancer cells although through different mechanisms., Some Se compounds such as
    methylseleninic acid can inhibit angiogenesis., These data combined with the inhibitory
    effects of Se compounds on cancer cell growth have offered new directions for
    Se studies., 'Given mixed epidemiological results, the association between Se
    intake and breast cancer incidence is still unclear.', The results of one study
    among Japanese women showed a significant difference in Se levels between newly
    diagnosed breast cancer patients and healthy counterparts; whereas in other studies
    there was no relationship between Se levels and breast cancer risk or incidence.,
  'Despite the lack of a strong association between Se intake and human breast cancer
    incidence, the effects of Se on mammary gland tumorigenesis have been studied
    extensively.', 'The inhibition of tumorigenesis by different Se compounds was
    demonstrated in several models including mouse virus-induced, chemical carcinogen-induced
    and spontaneous mammary tumors.', Ip et al., 'showed that in vitro, MSA inhibited
    cell growth and induced apoptosis in mouse mammary hyperplastic epithelial cells.',
  'In vivo, methylselenocysteine and MSA both reduced the incidence of chemical carcinogen-induced
    breast cancer by nearly 50%.', Li et al., demonstrated in an MCF7 human breast
    cancer cell/nude mice xenograft system that methylselenocysteine reduced breast
    cancer tumor growth by inducing apoptosis and inhibiting angiogenesis., 'Nevertheless,
    most investigations of Se and cancer are focused on chemoprevention and inhibition
    of the early events of tumor progression.', There are very few investigations
    of the role of Se in later stages of tumor development including metastasis.,
  Song et al., showed that melanoma metastasis was suppressed in a C57BL/6 mouse model
    supplemented with Se., Another report suggested that a deficiency of selenoprotein
    15 in colon cancer cells reduced both cancer incidence and lung metastases in
    a BALB/c mouse model., 'So far, there are no reports regarding the role of Se
    in spontaneous metastasis of breast cancer.', 'In our study, we used a 4T1.2/BALB/c
    mouse model to investigate how the status of dietary Se affected primary mammary
    tumor growth and metastasis.', We asked further if different Se compounds showed
    distinct effects., 'Three Se-supplemented diets containing either sodium selenite,
    SeMet or MSA were fed to mice for 3 months before cancer inoculation.', Primary
    tumor growth and metastatic severity for each group were compared to those receiving
    a Se-deficient or a Se-adequate diet., 'Previously, we had determined that MSA,
    but not selenite supplementation mitigated an osteoblast inflammatory response
    to cancer cells, which implies that Se compounds differently modulate immune responses.',
  "Therefore, we assayed the mice sera for cytokines important for the regulation
    of immunity and cancer growth: granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, macrophage-colony
    stimulating factor, interlukin-2, interleukin-6, monocyte chemotactic protein
    1, interferon \u03B3, tumor necrosis factor \u03B1 and vascular endothelial growth
    factor.", We found that the various diets affected breast cancer metastasis differently.,
  'Inorganic Se, sodium selenite, only provided short-term inhibition of primary tumor
    growth, failed to reduce and possibly exacerbated metastasis.', 'Conversely, the
    organic Se supplements, especially SeMet, resulted in significantly reduced primary
    tumor growth and in the least metastatic burden.', "IL-2, Il-6, IFN\u03B3 and
    VEGF elevation in the sera of SeMet-supplemented mice emphasized the differences
    among Se compounds and the importance of utilizing the most suitable one.", '4T1.2,
    a murine metastatic breast cancer line derived from a spontaneously arising mammary
    tumor in BALB/cfC3H mice, mimics the metastatic pattern of human breast cancer
    with a higher tendency to metastasize to bone when inoculated orthotopically.',
  "The cells, provided by Dr. Erica Sloan and Dr. Robin Anderson, were maintained
    in alpha minimum essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum plus penicillin
    100 U/ml and streptomycin 100 \u03BCg/ml.", "4T1.2luc cells stably expressing
    luciferase were gifted by Dr. Yuan Mei Lou and Dr. Shoukat Dedhar and were maintained
    in Dulbeccos modified Eagles medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM glutamine,

    5 \u03BCg/ml puromycin.", Proportionally mixed 4T1.2luc and 4T1.2 cells were used
    to extract genomic DNA and to generate a standard curve for luciferase quantitative
    PCR as described below., Three-week-old female BALB/c were kept on Se-supplemented
    diets for 3 months before inoculation with cancer cells., They were observed daily
    and weighed once a week throughout the experiment., 'All the procedures were conducted
    under the approval of the Pennsylvania State University, the Institutional Animal
    Care and Use Committee.', L-SeMet was a kind gift from Sabinsa Corporation; whereas
    MSA was purchased from Sigma for the preparation of custom diets., Sodium selenite
    is the Se source used by the Harlan Teklad Laboratories and its concentration
    was adjusted accordingly., Mice were fed one of five different Se-containing diets.,
  The Se-deficient chow contained less than 0.01 ppm Se; the Se-adequate contained
    0.08 ppm sodium selenite; the selenite-supplemented contained 0.4 ppm sodium selenite;
    the SeMet-supplemented contained 3 ppm L-SeMet and the MSA-supplemented contained
    3 ppm MSA., Concentrations of Se selected were based on previous literature.,
  Mice were provided with double distilled water., Mice were kept on the same diet
    for the duration of the experiment., 4T1.2luc cells were maintained without antibiotics
    for 2 weeks before inoculation., The intensity of luciferase expression was confirmed
    by using the luciferase assay system as the manual instructed., Cells were injected
    into the left fourth mammary gland of mice under anesthesia by isoflurane inhalation.,
  'Once the primary tumor was palpable, tumor size was measured weekly with an electric
    caliper.', 'The equation, tumor volume =/2, was used to calculate primary tumor
    size.', 'Animals showing signs of distress before the end point, such as rapid
    loss of weight, decreased response to stimulation and hindered limb movement,
    were removed from the experiment.', A total of four mice were removed before the
    end of the experiment., "Tumor growth and metastatic patterns were monitored by
    IVIS\xAE Lumina II weekly.", "Mice were injected intraperitoneally with 150 \u03BCl
    D-luciferin and placed under isoflurane for 10 min.", Animals were imaged for
    1 min., 'Because the respiratory function was weakened by the development of lung
    metastases in some mice, total isoflurane inhalation time was limited to 15 min.',
  'Thirty days after cancer cell inoculation, mice were euthanized by CO2 inhalation.',
  'Lung, heart, liver, kidney, spleen and both femurs were removed, and metastatic
    nodules on organ surfaces were counted.', "Organs were stored at \u221280\xB0C
    until genomic DNA was extracted using the DNeasy Blood &amp; Tissue Kit.", Organs
    were homogenized in liquid nitrogen into fine powders to eliminate uneven distribution
    of cancer cells., About 20 mg of tissue powder from each organ was used to extract
    DNA., "Serum was stored at \u221280\xB0C before cytokine analysis.", Real-time
    PCR was used to quantify tumor burden., This assay was modified from Havens et
    al., Genomic DNA was subjected to qPCR to detect the cycle threshold of luciferase
    and GAPDH., This Ct value was normalized using GAPDH to measure total sample DNA.,
  A standard curve was established by using DNA from 4T1.2 and 4T1.2luc mixed proportionally.,
  A comparison of the Ct values of luciferase and GAPDH was used to calculate the
    amount of DNA from cancer cells., "The PCR reactions were done by a StepOnePlus\u2122

    array, which allowed for the simultaneous quantitation of eight mouse cytokines.",
  Every sample was measured in duplicate., The sensitivities and precision of the
    assay depend on the cytokines., 'Generally, the detection limit of each cytokine
    was less than 3.5 pg/ml except MCP-1, which was 6.7 pg/ml.', The coefficient of

    tissue homogenate was digested in 50% nitric acid in a MARS Xpress microwave digestion
    system., The nitric acid in the digested solution was diluted to 20% before Se
    analysis by Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy using an AAnalyst 600 spectrometer
    with graphite furnace., Total Se was analyzed by measuring the absorption at 196
    nm., Each sample was measured in duplicate., Livers from five mice from each dietary
    group were measured., Liver tissues from each dietary group were homogenized in
    T-PER Tissue Protein Extraction Reagent., "A total of 20 \u03BCg homogenate was
    used for GPX1, TR1 and GAPDH detection.", Statistics analysis was carried out
    using SAS and Prism., 'Main effects were evaluated by Fishers test, Turkey multiple
    comparison and chi-squared test using one-way analysis of variance model.', Statistical
    significance was defined as the probability of at least p ; 0.05 in all analyses.,
  'In a pilot study, we found that dietary Se supplementation did not result in a
    longer survival time compared to either a Se-def or a Se-adequate diet.', 'Therefore,
    to reduce any unnecessary discomfort to animals, the endpoint was set at 30 days
    after cancer cell inoculation.', 'Generally, mice developed a palpable tumor mass
    by 2 weeks.', The diameters of primary tumors were measured and used to calculate
    tumor volumes., 'On day 16, tumor volume was clearly affected by the Se status.',
  'All mice on Se-supplemented diets, 400Sel, SeMet and MSA, showed significantly
    less primary tumor growth compared to those on the Se-def diet.', Tumor volumes
    of mice fed a Se-def diet were 2.4- to 3.9-fold greater than those of mice fed
    Se-supplemented diets., The difference between the Se-def and the Se adequate
    diets was also significant., 'However, not every Se-supplemented diet maintained
    the suppression of tumor growth.', 'By day 23, the 400Sel diet was no longer effective.',
  Mice supplemented with SeMet or MSA still showed reduced tumor volumes compared
    to mice on either Se-def or 80Sel diets., 'By day 30, only mice on the SeMet diet
    showed significantly reduced tumor growth.', 'Taken together, these data suggested
    that Se deficiency may be permissive to the initiation of tumor development.',
  'Although mice on all three Se-supplemented diets showed delayed tumor growth at
    the earlier stages of tumor development, only the SeMet diet maintained this property
    by the endpoint.', 'To test the Se levels in each dietary group, we measured the
    total Se content and the expression of GPX1 and TR1 in liver.', Mice were randomly
    selected to represent each group., There was no Se detectable in the liver of
    Se-def mice., All Se-containing diets resulted in a significant amount of Se in
    the liver., There was a nonsignificant increase of Se content in 400Sel and MSA
    groups compared to 80Sel group., 'Mice fed with SeMet contained significantly
    more Se than other groups, which may be because of SeMet nonspecific incorporation
    into polypeptides.', Similar results were observed in GPX1 and TR1 detection.,
  No GPX1 and very little TR1 were present in the livers of Se-def mice; all Se-containing
    diets sufficiently saturated the expression of both selenoproteins., Figure 1\.,

    IVIS-detectable metastasis were documented., 'Tumor development and metastasis
    were monitored by IVIS imaging on days 9, 16, 23 and 30 after cancer cell inoculation.',
  All mice developed primary tumors., 'However, the pattern and severity of metastasis
    detected by this method were diverse even within the same diet group.', Some mice
    appeared to develop primary tumors without any IVIS-detectable metastasis; some
    developed extensive metastases in multiple organs., 'On day 23, less than half
    of mice on Se-def, SeMet or MSA diets showed signs of luciferase-expressing metastases.',
  'However, mice with selenite supplementation had a greater incidence of metastasis
    than the mice supplemented with SeMet or MSA.', 'There were 12 mice in the 400Sel
    diet group, eight in the 80Sel group, six in the Se-def group, six in the SeMet
    group and seven in the MSA group, which showed detectable metastasis.', Based
    on IVIS imaging nearly half of the mice on the 400Sel diet showed extensive metastasis
    on day 30 compared to other diets., 'Also, all mice in the 400Sel diet group developed
    metastasis on day 30.', There were no significant differences among other diet
    groups., These data suggested that supplementation with sodium selenite may promote
    breast cancer metastasis., 'Among all organs investigated, lungs showed the most
    extensive metastases.', There were more metastatic nodules and cancer cells present
    than in other organs., We used two methods to determine the severity of metastasis.,
  One was by counting the metastatic nodules on the organ surface; the other was by
    measuring the amount of the luciferase gene by qPCR in genomic DNA extracted from
    organs., 'Some mice in the Se-def, 80Sel and 400Sel diets showed extensive lung
    metastasis, i.e., more than 20% of the genomic DNA was from cancer cells.', 'In
    contrast, the DNA from lungs of mice bearing the most extensive lung metastases
    in the SeMet and MSA diet groups contained only 4.4 and 6.3%, respectively, of
    total genomic DNA from cancer cells.', 'With this method, nearly all mice had
    detectable luciferase DNA in their lung tissues.', 'However, the only statistically
    significant difference was between mice fed the 400Sel and SeMet diets.', The
    difference in sensitivity between this method and imaging may be owing to the
    size of the metastases and the intensity of the luciferase signal., Figure 2\.,
  The quantification of breast cancer lung metastasis., 'At the time of sacrifice,
    the lungs were removed and the numbers of nodules were counted.', 'The lungs were
    then frozen in liquid nitrogen, homogenized and the DNA extracted as described

    group contained more nodules in the lung than mice in either SeMet or MSA diet
    group.', Another statistically significant difference was found between the Se-Def
    and MSA groups., 'Taken together, these data suggested that sodium selenite supplementation
    did not suppress and may have enhanced the numbers of cancer cells present in
    the lung.', 'Conversely, the other two Se-supplemented diets appeared to have
    somewhat been protective.', Heart metastases were less prevalent across all diet
    groups., Fewer mice showed metastatic nodules; many of them had a single nodule
    compared to multiple nodules in lungs., 'Using the same methods to investigate
    the metastatic status in the heart, we found that there were no statistical significant
    differences in the severity of heart metastasis among the Se diets.', 'Even so,
    we noticed that more mice in the 400Sel diet group had more visible nodules than
    mice in the Se-def and 80Sel groups.', Eckhardt et al., reported that 4T1.2 cells
    metastasized to the liver far less than to other major organs., Our results corresponded
    with their observation., We found that less than 1% of the DNA was from cancer
    cells for most liver samples., 'Nonetheless, the data indicated that mice on a
    Se-Def diet had significantly more liver metastases than those on the SeMet diet.',
  'On the other hand, only two mice had visible nodules in the liver, which made the
    determination of tumor burden based on the counts of nodules inappropriate.',

    had a tendency to increase the occurrence of kidney metastasis.', 'Eleven of 14
    mice in both 80Sel and 400Sel diet groups had detectable cancer DNA in the kidney,

    increased nodules in the kidney compared to those on the Se-def, SeMet and MSA
    diets.', 'Compared to the Se-def and SeMet diets, kidneys of mice on the 80Sel

    Se-supplemented groups.", The level of IL-6 was significantly different between
    SeMet and 80Sel mice., "The level of TNF\u03B1 was significantly different between
    MSA and Se-def and MSA and 80Sel mice.", VEGF was significantly higher in the
    SeMet mice., 'There was no significant difference among mice fed the various Se
    diet G-CSF, M-CSF and MCP-1.', Each sample was measured in duplicate., 'p &lt;
    0.05, p &lt; 0.01.', 'In our study, we investigated whether dietary Se affected
    breast cancer growth and metastasis in the 4T1.2luc/BALB/c mouse model.', 'Furthermore,
    we compared three different Se supplements: sodium selenite, MSA and SeMet.',
  'Although no Se compound tested was the "magic cure" for preventing cancer growth
    or metastasis in this aggressive tumor animal model, our data suggested that of
    the diets, sodium selenite supplementation exhibited only a short-term delay of
    tumor growth, which was overcome at later stages.', 'Conversely, two organic Se
    compounds were more potent in inhibiting primary tumor growth.', 'Despite the
    noticeable variation within groups, the primary tumors of SeMet-supplemented mice
    were significantly reduced compared to those of Se-def mice.', 'Moreover, these
    Se compounds affected breast cancer development diversely with different efficiencies.',
  'Among three diets, the 400Sel diet resulted in the most extensive metastasis based
    on IVIS imaging and tumor burden quantification in lungs, livers, kidneys and
    femurs.', Mice fed selenite also exhibited increased metastasis in the kidneys
    and the femurs., 'Mice fed the SeMet diet showed less metastases in the lungs
    and the kidneys compared to the 400Sel diet, less in the liver compared to the
    Se-def group and less in the femur compared to the 80Sel diet.', The MSA diet
    also resulted in less metastasis although not to the same extent as the SeMet
    diet., 'We found no significant difference in cancer development between the Se-deficient
    and Se-adequate groups, which supports the theory that the anticancer benefits
    of Se supplementation take place at supranutritional levels.', 'Taken together,
    among three Se compounds used in our study, SeMet provided the most protection
    against primary tumor growth and metastasis.', It has been noted that the plasma
    or serum Se levels are low in breast cancer patients at the time of diagnosis
    and throughout treatment compared to their healthy counterparts., There is another
    decrease after radiotherapy., 'However, whether this reduction was caused by low
    Se intake or was a result of metabolism is unknown.', Holmes et al., 'observed
    a nonsignificant inverse association between Se intake and mortality, whereas
    Saquib et al.', "reported a nonsignificant increase in mortality with breast cancer
    patients with either an intake of more than 400 \u03BCg/day or less than 55 \u03BCg/day
    Se compared to patients with an adequate intake.", 'Interestingly, a study by
    Harris et al.', "in Sweden, a naturally low-Se country, showed a significant positive
    association between Se intake and cancer-specific and overall mortality in breast
    cancer patients compared to patients with less than 20 \u03BCg/day Se intake.",
  These data suggest that Se supplementation is more effective in a population with
    lower Se levels., The relevance of Se in breast cancer prevention and treatment
    has been studied extensively using in vitro and animal models., 'It has been reported
    that Se effectively inhibited cancer cell growth, caused cell cycle arrest, induced
    apoptosis, reduced angiogenesis and enhanced the efficacy of the anticancer drug,
    paclitaxel.', The majority of current research is focused on deciphering the involvement
    of Se in early stages of cancers., There are very few researchers investigating
    the association between Se and later stages of cancer., 'As far as we know, there
    is no previous report focused on the effect of Se on spontaneous breast cancer
    metastasis.', Our data suggest that Se may inhibit breast tumor development.,
  'However, the efficacy of Se may depend on the formulation.', None of the Se compounds
    used in our study with an aggressive tumor model was totally effective., We measured
    serum cytokines to seek insights about the diverse results among Se-supplemented
    groups., "Compared to the Se-def or 80Sel groups, several cytokines were detected
    or elevated in both SeMet and MSA groups, including IL-2, IFN\u03B3, TNF\u03B1
    and IL-6.", "IL-2 and IFN\u03B3 are involved in NK cell activation, the first-line
    immune barrier against tumor cells.", "It has been reported that IL-2 and IFN\u03B3
    induce the antitumor activity of NK cells, which may contribute to the decreased
    primary tumor and lower metastatic burdens in SeMet and MSA groups.", "TNF\u03B1
    secreted by macrophages and NK cells can induce cancer cell death.", "On the other
    hand, TNF\u03B1 is a multifunctional cytokine that can stimulate the production
    of many other cytokines, including IL-6 and VEGF, which may explain their observed
    increase.", 'Considering that the serum levels of IL-6 and VEGF increased but
    the tumor burdens were lower in mice fed SeMet or MSA, we speculate that Se may
    act through other mechanisms to mitigate metastasis.', The short-term growth-inhibitory
    effect of selenite may be explained by its ability to induce apoptosis., We must
    also consider the fact that the levels of circulating cytokines can differ widely
    from local sites and may affect different types of cells differently., 'It is
    very likely that Se alters the interactions between breast cancer cells and local
    host cells to make the microenvironment more or less favorable for the cancer
    cells, which could result in different metastatic burdens in the Se-supplemented
    groups.', 'In a previous in vitro study, we found that selenite did not decrease
    the inflammatory response of osteoblasts caused by breast cancer cells, and slightly
    increased the production of some proinflammatory cytokines, IL-6 and MCP-1.',
  'These cytokines are osteoclastogenic and promote osteolysis, which releases growth
    factors into the bone microenvironment to support tumor cell growth.', We believe
    that the strong local inflammation may account for the more aggressive metastasis
    pattern in the 400Sel group., "Additionally, we reported that MSA inhibited NF-\u03BAB
    and decreased the inflammatory response of osteoblasts to breast cancer cells.",
  'MSA can directly generate methylselenol, which is believed to be responsible for
    the anticancer effect of organic Se.', SeMet aided by methioninase can also rapidly
    generate methylselenol to induce apoptosis., 'Moreover, methylselenol appeared
    to exhibit some antiangiogenesis activity by downregulating key angiogenic molecules
    or by inducing apoptosis of endothelial cells.', 'Taken together, these organic
    Se compounds had the ability to induce cancer cell apoptosis, inhibit angiogenesis
    and reduce inflammation, all of which could contribute to the inhibition of primary
    tumor growth and the reduction of the severity of metastasis.', One concern is
    tissue storage and distribution., The amount of Se varies among tissues., 'In
    non-Se-deficient humans, generally 30% of total body Se is found in the liver,
    15% in the kidney, 30% in the muscle, 10% in the plasma and the remaining 15%
    throughout the body.', 'However, in a Se-deficient state, some organs, such as
    liver, rapidly lose Se while in other organs, such as brain, Se is more well maintained.',
  The distribution and concentration of Se in each organ may affect the efficacy of
    Se protection., It might be worthwhile to investigate delivery routes other than
    diet in order to increase Se availability in specific organs., 'In summary, SeMet
    supplementation provided more protection from breast cancer metastasis than selenite
    and MSA supplementations in a mouse model.', We showed the unsuitability of selenite
    to prevent or decrease breast cancer development and metastasis., 'Although the
    400Sel diet provided short-term protection against tumor growth, these same mice
    exhibited extensive metastasis.', Our data suggested that the selenite diet may
    increase breast cancer metastasis to the kidney and to bone., Our results also
    indicated that organic Se compounds inhibited tumor growth more efficiently and
    had a greater effect on metastasis., "An assay of serum cytokines indicated that
    mice fed SeMet and MSA had higher levels IL-6, IL-2, IFN\u03B3, TNF\u03B1 and
    VEGF.", 'In particular, SeMet provided the strongest defense against breast cancer
    development.', The authors thank Donna Sosnoski and Cassidy Grove for their help
