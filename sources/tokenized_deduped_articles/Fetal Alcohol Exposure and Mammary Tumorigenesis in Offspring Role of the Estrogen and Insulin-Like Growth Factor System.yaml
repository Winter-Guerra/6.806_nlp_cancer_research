    consumption during pregnancy could be that women born to these mothers have increased
    risk of developing breast cancer as adults.", 'Fetal exposure to alcohol has been
    shown to increase risk for childhood leukemia, suggesting that findings in rodent
    models may be relevant to human disease .', There is considerable discussion surrounding
    the over-diagnosis and overtreatment of breast atypia due to the difficulty in
    discerning which of these will progress to invasive cancer ., 'Therefore, it is
    of utmost importance to identify additional risk factors for breast cancer so
    that we can clearly distinguish which groups of women are at high risk for developing
    the disease.', 'While the finding that rodent offspring born to alcohol-exposed
    dams exhibit increased susceptibility to carcinogens as adults is consistently
    observed, the mechanisms underlying this increased susceptibility are not well
    understood.', The estrogen and insulin-like growth factor axes occupy central
    roles in both mammary gland development and breast cancer., This chapter will
    discuss evidence that this endocrine axis may be affected by alcohol exposure
    in utero leading to increased mammary tumorigenesis and propose potential mechanisms
    for these alterations., 'The development of the mammary gland depends on complex
    molecular interactions between the parenchyma and the supporting stroma throughout
    three main stages of life: fetal development, puberty, and reproduction.', 'The
    parenchyma consists of luminal and basal epithelial cells structured into ducts
    for milk production with adjacent myoepithelial cells that secrete basement membrane,
    while the stroma is comprised of multiple cell types including adipocytes, fibroblasts,
    immune cells, and nerve cells .', Much of what is known about human mammary gland
    development comes from rodent models ., 'In rats, mammary development begins between
    day 10 and 11 of gestation at which time the mammary streak is detected and consists
    of a single layer of ectodermal tissue stretching from the anterior to the posterior
    limb buds .', 'Over the next day, epidermal cells migrate to form several layers
    of cells, creating the mammary placodes .', In rats there are six pairs of mammary
    placodes which correspond to the number of mammary glands in the adult., Each
    mammary placode invaginates into the underlying mesenchyme to become a bulb-shaped
    mammary bud., The surrounding mesenchymal cells reorient themselves into a radial
    pattern surrounding the parenchyma to form a pad of fatty connective tissue.,
  "After a 3\u20134 day morphological quiescence there is a period of rapid cellular
    proliferation, which results in the mammary sprout.", 'This elongates, forming
    ducts that penetrate the fat pad precursor such that at birth, the gland is comprised
    of a limited number of branching ducts .', 'After birth the mammary gland continues
    to grow isometrically with the rest of the body until the onset of ovarian hormones
    during puberty, when growth becomes allometric.', 'The leading edge of each duct
    enlarges to form a club-shaped structure called a terminal end bud, which contains
    highly proliferative cells.', 'Once the ducts have penetrated the fat pad and
    undergone initial bifurcations, the complexity of the milk duct system increases
    through side branching during each estrous cycle.', 'During pregnancy, ductal
    side branching becomes even more extensive.', Subsequently during lactation the
    gland becomes mature and fully functional., The epithelial component of the gland
    proliferates and fills the fat pad with lobular alveolar structures., The alveoli
    differentiate to produce milk proteins which are secreted into the ductal lumen
    and transported to the nipple., 'Once suckling ceases the gland undergoes involution,
    during which epithelial cells undergo apoptosis and the alveolar structures dedifferentiate
    .', 'Estrogens are steroid hormones that are produced mainly in the ovaries in
    pre-menopausal women, with minor contributions from adipose tissue and the adrenal
    glands.', "17\u03B2-estradiol is the major circulating estrogen, but minor forms
    include estrone and estriol, with E3 produced by the placenta during pregnancy.",
  The hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis regulates ovarian production of estrogen.,
  'The hypothalamic peptide gonadotropin-releasing hormone induces release of luteinizing
    hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone which simulate androgen production and
    aromatase activity, respectively.', 'Aromatase catalyzes the aromatization of
    testosterone to E2, the final rate-limiting step of E2 biosynthesis.', 'The high
    levels of E2 released during ovulation feedback to inhibit the release of GnRH,
    LH, and FSH.', 'The classical genomic mechanism of E2 action is initiated when
    E2 diffuses across the plasma membrane and binds to ER in the cytoplasm, where
    it resides bound to heat-shock proteins.', 'Binding of E2 to ER results in its
    dissociation from these proteins, leading to dimerization of the receptor and
    translocation to the nucleus where the complex functions as a ligand-activated
    transcription factor by binding to estrogen response elements to initiate expression
    of multiple target genes .', 'Additionally, non-genomic effects of E2 have been
    described and will be discussed more below .', Classical estrogen signaling pathway
    in the cell., "17-\u03B2 estradiol diffuses across the plasma membrane and binds

    \n\nEstrogens act primarily through two nuclear ERs, ER-\u03B1 and ER-\u03B2.",
  E2 is required for the initial formation of the TEBs during pubertal mammary gland
    development., Ovariectomy of mice around the onset of puberty causes regression
    of TEBs which reappear when E2 pellets are implanted ., "Additionally, ER-\u03B1
    knockout mice have mammary glands that appear rudimentary and lack any branching
    or TEBs .", "Transplantation studies indicate that while ER-\u03B1 is expressed
    in both the stroma and the epithelium of the developing gland , ER-\u03B1 in the
    epithelial cells is most important for growth .", "Deletion of ER-\u03B2 does
    not affect ductal growth of the mammary gland  though it does interfere with terminal
    differentiation during lactation .", A role for E2 in the etiology and progression
    of breast cancer was first recognized when bilateral ovariectomy in pre-menopausal
    breast cancer patients was found to result in cancer remission ., This finding
    led to investigation into the role of ovarian hormones and their receptors in
    breast cancer., "Since approximately 70 % of all breast cancers are ER-\u03B1
    positive and require E2 for growth, an effective treatment strategy in women with
    ER-\u03B1 positive tumors has been to block the E2 system with either selective
    ER modulators that bind to and block ER-\u03B1, or aromatase inhibitors, which
    act by inhibiting E2 production .", "For this reason, ER-\u03B1 has become a prognostic
    and predictive marker for breast cancer.", The fact that a number of breast cancer
    risk factors correspond with an increase in exposure of the mammary gland to E2
    has led to the idea that lifetime exposure to this hormone is a primary risk factor
    for the disease ., "Increased exposure to E2 across a women\u2019s lifetime is
    thought to indirectly affect carcinogenesis by increasing the number of cell cycles
    and thus the chances of genetic mutations.", 'In addition, many studies have reported
    that increased serum E2 is positively associated with breast cancer risk in postmenopausal
    women .', 'However, recent meta-analyses of multiple epidemiological studies suggest
    that postmenopausal hormone concentrations are not strongly related to age at
    menarche or first full-term pregnancy, parity or family history , suggesting that
    these risk factors are not likely mediated through postmenopausal hormone levels.',
  'These risk factors may instead operate through long-term effects of sex hormone
    levels in pre-menopausal women such as changes in the duration rather than the
    level of long-term exposure to sex hormones, by permanent changes in breast structure
    induced by pregnancy and lactation, or by other mechanisms .', A second mechanism
    by which E2 may impact carcinogenesis is via direct carcinogenic properties of
    E2 metabolites., The conversion of E2 to 2- or 4-OH-E2 results in reactive oxygen
    species byproducts that are carcinogenic ., 'Also, the metabolites themselves
    can directly bind DNA and form adducts leading to mutagenesis .', The ERKO/Wnt-1
    transgenic mouse demonstrates the importance of these metabolites in tumor initiation.,
  "In this study treating ERKO/Wnt-1 transgenic mice with E2 increased mammary carcinogenesis
    in the absence of ER-\u03B1, thus implicating the metabolites as the culprits
    .", The IGF family is comprised of two ligands and six IGF-binding proteins that
    modulate the actions of IGFs., 'They exert their biological effects primarily
    through the IGF type I receptor, a heterodimeric intrinsic tyrosine kinase receptor
    .', "The IGF-IR gene encodes a protein consisting of an extracellular \u03B1 ligand
    binding domain and a \u03B2 subunit containing the intracellular tyrosine kinase
    domain which dimerizes with a second unit to form the functional receptor.", The
    insulin receptors A and B are closely related to IGF-IR and it has recently been
    recognized that IGF-insulin hybrid receptors may also influence IGF action in
    the mammary gland ., 'Binding of IGF ligand induces autophosphorylation of the
    receptor, followed by activation of adapter molecules such as insulin-receptor
    substrate 1 and Shc, setting in motion activation of the phosphatidyl inositol-3-kinase
    and mitogen activated protein kinase signal transduction cascades.', 'These signaling
    molecules activate downstream factors that stimulate multiple processes that regulate
    normal growth and development of the mammary gland, including cellular proliferation,
    survival, angiogenesis, and migration.', 'These processes also underlie abnormal
    growth processes that lead to breast cancer, including tumorigenesis and metastasis.',
  "Signal transduction pathways activated by IGF-I via the IGF-I receptor in the cell
    Reproduced with permission \n\nDevelopment of the mammary gland is regulated by
    complex hormonal interactions involving the pituitary hormones, growth hormone
    and prolactin, and the ovarian hormones, estrogen and progesterone.", The postnatal
    effects of GH in mammary gland development are predominately mediated through
    IGF-I ., The importance of IGF-I in mammary gland development is demonstrated
    by the finding that IGF-I knockout mice have dramatically impaired TEB formation
    and ductal development ., Understanding the role of the IGF system in normal mammary
    gland development is complicated by the fact that IGF-I exerts it effects on the
    mammary gland through both endocrine and autocrine/paracrine mechanisms ., 'The
    majority of circulating IGF-I is produced in the liver, while most tissues, including
    the mammary gland, also produce IGF-I at the local level.', GH can increase circulating
    IGF-I by binding to hepatic GH receptors and regulating hepatic production and/or
    it can bind to GH receptors in the mammary gland to increase local production
    ., Mice that exhibit reduced local and circulating levels of IGF-I have normal
    ductal elongation into the fat pad but fewer branching structures than normal
    mice., 'However, mice with a liver-specific deletion of IGF-I exhibit a 75 % reduction
    in circulating IGF-I, yet maintain normal mammary ductal branching , suggesting
    that locally produced IGF-I acts in a paracrine fashion to regulate branching
    morphogenesis.', Studies with transgenic mice that overexpress hepatic IGF-I but
    have no local IGF-I production show that circulating IGF-I can maintain normal
    mammary gland development in the absence of local IGF-I., 'In addition, HIT mice
    exhibit enhanced mammary gland proliferation compared to control mice, indicating
    that elevated circulating IGF-I in the presence of local IGF-I production can
    accelerate mammary gland growth .', Collectively these studies show that both
    local and endocrine actions of IGF-I are important in mammary gland development.,
  Both circulating and local production of IGF-I are also important in mammary tumorigenesis
    and progression., 'In LID mice, administration of the carcinogen DMBA results
    in a lower incidence of mammary tumors and delays tumor onset , supporting a role
    for circulating IGF-I in breast tumor progression.', 'Since IGF-I is predominately
    made in the stromal tissue in response to GH, a transgenic model was generated
    that mimics paracrine exposure of breast epithelial to stromal IGF-I by placing
    IGF-I under control of the keratinocyte 5 promoter, leading to overexpression
    of IGF-I in myoepithelial cells.', These mice show increased ductal proliferation
    prepubertally compared with wild-type mice and exhibit increased susceptibility
    to carcinogen-induced tumorigenesis as adults ., 'As mentioned above, the biological
    activity of IGF-I is modulated by a family of six high affinity IGFBPs.', 'Of
    these IGFBPs, a large body of evidence supports a role for IGFBP-5 as a growth-inhibitory
    and/or pro-apoptotic factor in the mammary gland .', There is a positive relationship
    between IGFBP-5 expression and cell death during mammary involution., 'Transgenic
    overexpression of IGFBP-5 in mammary tissue causes increases in apoptotic death
    of epithelial cells and reduces invasion of the mammary fat pad, while addition
    of exogenous IGFBP-5 to murine mammary epithelial cells suppresses IGF-I mediated
    survival .', 'Implantation of IGFBP-5 into one mammary gland of hypophysectomized,
    oophorectomized Sprague Dawley rats decreases the ability of GH and E2 to stimulate
    TEB formation after 7 days .', 'Likewise, when IGFBP-5 is injected into wild-type
    intact mice for 7 days beginning on day 16 of pregnancy, the proportion of secretory
    tissue in the gland is decreased and lactation is impaired .', 'Many of these
    pro-apoptotic, growth-inhibitory effects are thought to be related to the ability
    of IGFBP-5 to sequester IGF-I and prevent its pro-survival and growth-stimulatory
    effects.', The E2 system interacts extensively with the IGF system in modulating
    mammary gland development and tumorigenesis ., 'During mammary gland development,
    administration of E2 or IGF-I alone to ovariectomized, hypophysectomized rats
    does not restore full ductal development; however, the gland develops normally
    when these hormones are administered together .', 'Likewise, both E2 and IGF-I
    are required to restore normal mammary gland development in the IGF-I knockout
    mouse .', "At the cellular level, normal breast epithelial cells that are positive
    for ER-\u03B1 do not stain positive for Ki67 or bromodeoxyuridine incorporation,
    indicating that E2 is not directly driving proliferation .", 'E2 is believed to
    stimulate the release of IGF-I, which acts in a paracrine manner to drive growth
    of adjacent cells .', 'In breast cancer cells, the proliferative effect of E2
    is accounted for, in part, by its ability to upregulate components of the IGF
    signaling pathway, including IGF ligands, IGF-IR, and IRS-1 .', "Reciprocally,
    IGF ligands can act via the IGF-IR to enhance transcriptional activation of ER-\u03B1
    by promoting its binding to EREs or by phosphorylating ER-\u03B1 via activation
    of the PI3K and MAPK pathways .", 'The interactions between ER and IGF-IR may
    be mediated through a small pool of ERs localized to the plasma membrane, which
    can also occur in the absence of sex steroid .', "These include not only ER-\u03B1
    and ER-\u03B2, but also ER-\u03B1 transcript variants and the G-protein-coupled
    ER 1, a G-protein coupled receptor that is structurally different from the classical
    ERs .", 'A complex relationship between the membrane and nuclear effects of E2
    also involves membrane-initiated phosphorylation of coactivators, which are then
    recruited to the nucleus.', 'In addition to localizing to the nucleus and the
    plasma membrane, some ER may also localize to mitochondria .', 'Therefore, the
    integration of effects that are mediated by ERs at distinct cellular locations
    plays a major role in regulating cellular outcomes in the cell.', 'The finding
    that the E2/ER/IGF systems interact so extensively has led to the development
    of an array of therapeutic agents to target the IGF-IR signaling system in cancer,
    including breast cancer.', 'However, despite promising results in early phase
    trials, randomized phase III trials have not yet been successful, demonstrating
    the complexity of the IGF signaling system .', Several lines of evidence from
    rodent studies conducted in our laboratory show that alcohol-exposed offspring
    exhibit alterations in various components of the E2/IGF axis., Few mutations in
    components of the E2/IGF axis have been reported in humans which demonstrate the
    primary importance of these system components to normal growth and development.,
  'Therefore it is possible that alterations in the E2/IGF system are caused by epigenetic
    modifications, defined as heritable but reversible changes in gene function that
    occur without changes in nucleotide sequence.', 'In the sections below, we outline
    evidence indicating that exposure to alcohol in utero induces epigenetic events.',
  It is plausible that there could be epigenetic changes to E2/IGF hormone action
    in response to these alcohol-induced modifications., 'This regulation could occur
    at one or more levels to affect hormone synthesis, circulating and/or target tissue
    hormone levels, and/or target-organ responsiveness .', 'To determine if prenatal
    alcohol exposure induces early changes in mammary gland morphology that might
    enhance the susceptibility to a carcinogen in adulthood, we used the same in utero
    model of alcohol exposure described in the introduction.', 'Instead of injecting
    NMU at postnatal day 50, we euthanized animals at three developmental time points:
    PND 20, a prepubertal time point when the ductal structures in the mammary gland
    are highly proliferative, PND 40, near puberty when the HPG hormonal axis has
    been activated, and PND 80, when the mammary gland is mature.', Offspring were
    injected with BrdU prior to euthanization to quantitate cell proliferation., 'At
    20 and 40 days of age, animals exposed to alcohol in utero had an increased proliferative
    index compared to PF controls .', The increases between days 20 and 40 indicate
    that in utero alcohol exposure causes early changes in programming of the mammary
    gland that may contribute to the enhanced tumorigenesis observed in response to
    NMU., 'Given the increase in the proliferative state of the mammary gland at this
    early age, we hypothesized that alterations in the IGF-I axis might contribute
    to this effect.', 'Hepatic IGF-I mRNA levels were increased at all three time
    points in alcohol-exposed offspring, while IGF-I mRNA levels were also increased
    in the mammary gland at PND 20.', 'Interestingly, IGFBP-5 mRNA levels were significantly
    lower at PND 40 in animals exposed to prenatal alcohol relative to pair-fed controls.',
  'Therefore, a decrease in IGFBP-5 expression in tumors of rats exposed to alcohol
    in utero may allow more free IGF-I to access the IGF-IR and promote tumorigenesis.',
  IGFBP-5 is reduced in epithelial tumors such as head and neck squamous cell carcinoma
    and cervical carcinoma and has been proposed as a tumor suppressor gene ., 'Therefore,
    the increased proliferation we observed in alcohol-exposed offspring could also
    be related to a decrease in a tumor suppressor role of IGFBP-5, which could be
    independent of IGF-I.', Alcohol exposure in utero increases hepatic and mammary
    IGF-I expression and delays the developmental increase in mammary IGFBP-5 expression.,

    sacrifice on postnatal day 20, 40, or 80.', RNA was isolated and analyzed by qRT-PCR.,

    In addition to changes in the IGF axis, aromatase expression was increased in
    the mammary glands of alcohol-exposed offspring at both PND 20 and 40 .', 'As
    mentioned above, aromatase is the key enzyme that converts testosterone to E2.',
  'Interestingly, IGF-I enhances aromatase activity in a variety of cells although
    the mechanism is not well understood.', 'Recently, IGF-I was shown to increase
    aromatase activity by decreasing degradation of aromatase with no corresponding
    change in mRNA levels .', 'Therefore both IGF-I and E2 expression may be increased
    locally in mammary glands of alcohol-exposed offspring, where they may cross-talk
    to promote mammary proliferation in early development.', To further test our hypothesis
    that the E2 system is altered by alcohol exposure in utero we conducted another
    study in alcohol-exposed adult offspring in which we monitored the estrus cycle
    by vaginal cytology and sacrificed all animals during proestrus., Animals exposed
    to alcohol in utero exhibited significantly higher circulating levels of E2 relative
    to either pair-fed or ad libitum control groups., These data may be related to
    findings that in utero alcohol exposure alters the development and maturation
    of the HPG axis in female rats ., "Alcohol exposure in utero increases circulating
    levels of 17-\u03B2 estradiol during proestrus in adulthood.", Pups were sacrificed
    during proestrus to avoid cyclic differences in circulating E2 levels and trunk
    blood was collected., E2 levels were determined by ELISA., Different letters denote

    In addition to alcohol, exposure to a wide variety of toxic compounds during fetal
    or neonatal development affects postnatal mammary gland development and/or leads
    to increased susceptibility to mammary carcinogens in adulthood, supporting the
    fetal origins of disease hypothesis .', 'Many of these toxins are endocrine disruptors,
    which act by interfering with E2 action.', 'Furthermore, rodent studies have shown
    that maternal exposures to dietary factors such as high fat leads to alterations
    in mammary morphology during development and/or an increased risk of mammary cancer
    in the offspring .', Feeding a high fat diet also increases circulating concentrations
    of E2 in the dams ., Exposure to estrogens in utero due to female twin-ship  or
    DES treatment  is associated with a higher risk for breast cancer later in life.,
  'Based on the rationale that alterations in the fetal estrogenic environment may
    change the susceptibility of the mammary gland to later exposure to carcinogens,
    Hilakivi-Clarke et al.', measured E2 in the circulation of pregnant dams exposed
    to alcohol., They found an increase in E2 concentrations in the dams fed the lower
    level of alcohol but not in the dams fed the intermediate level of alcohol., 'Interestingly,
    tumor number was only increased in the dams fed the intermediate level of alcohol.',
  Whether circulating E2 levels are increased in dams fed high concentrations of alcohol
    has not yet been determined., 'As mentioned above, epigenetics involves heritable
    changes in gene expression that occur without an alteration in the primary nucleotide
    sequence of a gene.', 'Epigenetic modifications to nuclear chromatin structure
    alter DNA, histones, and non-histone proteins.', 'These modifications limit or
    enhance the accessibility and binding of the transcriptional machinery or recruit
    repressor complexes, resulting in changes in gene expression.', 'Epigenetic mechanisms
    include DNA methylation of promoter and/or non-promoter CpG islands, covalent
    histone modifications, microRNAs, and the more recently described long noncoding
    RNAs .', DNA methylation represents a major epigenetic regulatory pathway that
    is catalyzed by DNA methyltransferases., These enzymes add methyl groups from
    S-adenosylmethionines to carbon 5 positions of cytosines ., 'Three important family
    members of DNMTs have been reported: DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B.', 'DNMT1 is considered
    the maintenance DNA methyltransferase, whereas DNMT3A and DNMT3B are primarily
    involved in de novo DNA methylation .', 'Covalent histone modifications, including
    acetylation and methylation, are a second major pathway.', 'Histone acetylation
    and deacetylation are regulated by histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases,

    methyltransferases and histone demethylases, respectively .', Lysine residues
    on histone tails can be regulated by both methylation and acetylation., Modifications

    to DNA promoters directly, but are recruited by DNA-bound transcription factors.',
  'Overall, hypomethylation of DNA and histone acetylation cause a more relaxed chromatin
    state, allowing easier interaction between the DNA and the transcriptional machinery,
    thus resulting in increased gene transcription.', 'DNA hypermethylation and histone
    deacetylation result in condensed chromatin structure, causing a decrease in gene
    transcription .', The epigenome is particularly susceptible to environmental factors
    during fetal development as the DNA synthetic rate is high and the complex DNA
    methylation patterning and chromatin structure required for normal tissue development
    is established at this time ., DNA methylation and histone modifying pathways
    cross-talk and both are necessary for normal genomic imprinting during development
    ., Epigenetic reprogramming involves genome-wide erasure and re-establishment
    of DNA methylation and histone modifications during normal mammalian development
    ., 'Aberrant epigenetic regulation is also implicated in cancer, whereby oncogenes
    are expressed, and tumor suppressor genes are silenced .', 'In 1991, Garro et
    al.', "showed that administration of alcohol to pregnant mice on days 9\u201311
    of pregnancy resulted in genome-wide hypomethylation in 11-day old fetuses.",
  'The effect was proposed to be mediated by acetaldehyde, a product of alcohol metabolism,
    which inhibits DNA methyltransferase in vitro .', In the last few years numerous
    studies have confirmed that alcohol exposure in utero induces epigenetic alterations
    in the offspring., Studies with the Agouti mouse model demonstrate that alcohol
    exposure during gestation can affect adult phenotype through epigenetic mechanisms
    ., Microarray analysis of murine embryos exposed to alcohol on gestational day
    9 shows altered expression of a subset of genes involved in methylation and chromatin
    remodeling ., 'In support of this finding, analysis of whole-embryo murine cultures
    treated with alcohol show increased and decreased DNA methylation of 1,028 and
    1,136 genes, respectively.', 'Greater than 200 of these methylation alterations
    are found on chromosomes 7, 10, and X, which are chromosomes that contain many
    imprinted genes as well as genes prone to aberrant epigenetic silencing.', 'Additionally,
    changes in DNA methylation correspond with actual changes in gene expression in
    84 genes, indicating that fetal alcohol can impact gene expression in the developing
    embryo through an epigenetic mechanism .', 'In addition to global methylation
    analyses, several studies have focused on methylation changes in specific genes.',
  "Exposure of mice to alcohol between gestational days 10 and 18 affects methylation
    of the paternally imprinted H19 gene in the offspring\u2019s sperm, resulting
    in a 3 % decrease in the number of methylated CpGs in this gene at 8 weeks of
    age.", The CCCTC-factor DNA-binding sites of H19 play a role in regulating IGF-II
    expression ., 'Due to the well-defined neurological consequences of developmental
    alcohol exposure, recent studies have focused on epigenetic regulators expressed
    specifically in the brain.', Perinatal alcohol exposure induces gene expression
    changes in epigenetic regulators in the hippocampus as well as increases in DNMT
    activity ., Alcohol exposure of fetal cerebral cortical neuroepithelial stem cells
    causes a decrease in trimethylation of H3K4 and H3K27 in developmental genes that
    play an integral role in regulating neural stem cells as well as neural differentiation
    ., 'H3K4me3 is usually associated with gene activation, whereas H3K27me3 is considered
    a repressive histone mark .', 'Expression of epigenetic-modifying enzymes such
    as Dnmt1, Uhrf1, Ash2L1, Wdr5, Ehmt1, and Kdm1b are also observed .', DNMT expression
    and histone modifications are also altered in the hypothalamus of offspring exposed
    to fetal alcohol., "In utero alcohol exposure from gestational day 7\u201321 results
    in a decrease in H3K4 di- and trimethylation as well as H3K9 acetylation, and
    an increase in H3K9 dimethylation as well as expression of DNMT1, DNMT3a, and
    methyl-CpG-binding protein .", 'These studies raise the possibility that alcohol
    exposure in utero will affect epigenetic regulators in other tissues as well,
    including the ovaries and mammary gland.', 'While epigenetic alterations induced
    by fetal alcohol exposure in the mammary gland have not been investigated to date,
    other in utero exposures cause epigenetic modifications in the mammary gland.',
  High fat or ethinyl-oestradiol exposure in utero increases DNMT1 expression in PND
    50 rat mammary glands ., 'Global methylation analysis of PND 50 mammary glands
    from EE2 exposed rats reveals 375 differentially methylated promoter regions,
    of which 21 are hypermethylated and 161 are hypomethylated .', In utero exposure
    to DES or bisphenol-A also induces epigenetic alterations in the adult mammary
    gland ., DES exposure between gestational days 9 and 26 increases expression of
    the histone methyltransferase EZH2 in mammary glands of 6-week-old female mice.,
  'BPA or DES exposure also lead to increased histone H3K27 trimethylation, an EZH2
    target, in the mammary gland indicating that EZH2 methyltransferase activity increases.',
  Overexpression of EZH2 has been documented in breast cancer and is associated with
    aggressive forms of the disease ., "In summary, in utero exposures can cause epigenetic
    modifications specifically in the mammary gland and these epigenetic alterations
    can potentially affect the offspring\u2019s risk of mammary cancer.", The E2 signaling
    axis can also be epigenetically affected by in utero exposure., "Treatment of
    mice with BPA during gestational days 9\u201316 leads to decreased DNA methylation
    in the homeobox gene Hoxa10 in the uteri of 2 week old mice, subsequently resulting
    in increased Hoxa10 mRNA and protein expression .", "The decrease in Hoxa10 DNA
    methylation leads to increased binding of ER-\u03B1 to the EREs located on the
    Hoxa10 promoter.", 'Furthermore, transfection of MCF-7 breast cancer cells with
    the unmethylated Hoxa10 promoter increases luciferase activity in response to
    E2 compared to MCF-7 cells transfected with the methylated promoter, indicating
    that the unmethylated Hoxa10 promoter is more estrogen responsive, leading to
    an increase in ERE-driven gene expression .', 'It is possible that this epigenetic
    effect on the E2 signaling axis is not specific to BPA or endocrine disruptors
    in general, but may be an effect that can be initiated by a variety of in utero
    exposures such as alcohol.', The studies outlined above indicate that prenatal
    alcohol exposure induces epigenetic modifications., 'Therefore, it is plausible
    that alcohol exposure in utero could affect epigenetic regulation of the E2/IGF
    system.', 'Recent evidence has indicated that steroidogenic enzymes, nuclear receptors,
    and transcription factors involved in steroid hormone synthesis and action can
    be epigenetically regulated .', It is therefore possible that alcohol exposure
    in utero can disrupt the normal epigenetic regulation of these key molecules involved
    in hormone signaling., Changes in the steroid signaling pathway induced by epigenetic
    modification could then interface with the IGF system as described above., 'Further
    studies will determine if fetal alcohol exposure induces epigenetic modifications
    in genes that can regulate hormone action at key phases of mammary development,
    ultimately leading to changes in susceptibility to carcinogens.']
