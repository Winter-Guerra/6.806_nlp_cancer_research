['It has been demonstrated that ganoderma acids suppress growth, angiogenesis and
    invasiveness of highly invasive and metastatic breast cancer cells in vitro and
    vivo.', 'However, the mechanism of action of ganoderma acids in breast cancer
    remains unknown.', 'In the present study, we looked into the effect of ganoderic
    acid Me on cellular phenotypes and tumor growth in the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer
    cell line.', The results indicated the GA-Me inhibited nuclear factor kappaB activity
    at 24 h in MDA-MB-231 cells., 'When MDAMB- 231 cells were stimulated with tumor
    necrosis factor-alpha, the inhibitory effects of GA-Me were still maintained.',
  "We demonstrated that GA-Me inhibited proliferation and invasion and induced apoptosis
    in MDA-MB-231 cells via suppressing the NF-\u03BAB activity.", "However, GA-Me
    did not inhibit the phosphorylation and degradation of IkappaB-\u03B1.", "GA-Me
    down-regulated the expression of various NF-\u03BAB-regulated genes including
    genes involved in cell proliferation, anti-apoptosis, invasion and angiogenesis-6
    and -8).", I.P., administration of GA-Me inhibited tumor growth of MDA-MB-231
    cells in vivo., "Our results demonstrated that GA-Me inhibited proliferation,
    angiogenesis, invasion and induced apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells via suppressing
    NF-\u03BAB activity and the expression profile of its downstream genes.", "These
    findings provide evidence for a novel role of GA-Me in the prevention and treatment
    of breast cancer by its ability to modulate the NF-\u03BAB signaling pathway."]
