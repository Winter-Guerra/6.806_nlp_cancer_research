['Flaxseed or linseed comes from the flax plant, an annual herb.', 'The main importance
    of flaxseed is in the human nutrition sector because it is emerging as an important
    functional food ingredient thanks to the content of active compounds, pointed
    to provide health benefits.', 'There are several ways to eat flaxseed: milled,
    in the form of oil or added to bakery product.', "Scientific evidences support
    consumption of flaxseed for the high content in omega-3, omega-6 rich oil, \u03B1-linolenic
    acid, lignans, high quality proteins and fibers, compounds which are biologically
    active in the prevention of some chronic diseases such as many types of cancer,
    diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and cerebrovascular stroke.", 'Furthermore,
    advantages in flaxseed consumptions are shown in animal nutrition sector and therefore
    result in healthier food from animal origin.', 'In fact, the fatty acid profile
    of the meat and fat is directly affected by the source of fat in diet in swine
    and poultry, feeding omega-3 enriched diets by the addition of flaxseed would
    increase the omega-3 content in eggs and meat and thus enrich the products.',

    Consumers interest in healthy eating, in the last decades, shifted towards the
    potential health benefits of specific foods and food ingredients.', 'Foods, in
    fact, are not intended to only satisfy hunger and to provide basic nutritional
    requirements but also to prevent nutrition-related diseases and to improve physical
    and mental well-being of the consumers.', 'Consumer demand for foods with greater
    beneficial effects, led food industries in increasing the production of functional
    foods that now represents a significant share of new food products.', 'The result
    was a growing demand for marketing authorizations and the regulatory authorities
    had to face the problem of the evaluation of "claims" proposed by companies, in
    the absence of clear and global rules.', 'Therefore, the need of a European Union
    law, which regulates the marketing of functional foods, has led to the definition
    of Regulation CE 1924/2006, with the aim of protecting consumers, promoting fair
    trade promotion and encourages product innovation in food industry .', 'In the
    relationship between diet, health and well-being, functional foods play an outstanding
    role.', 'Many definitions exist worldwide for functional foods, but there is no
    official or commonly accepted definition .', 'The European Commissions Concerted
    Action on Functional Food Science in Europe, defined that a food product can only
    be considered functional if together with the basic nutritional impact it has
    beneficial effects on one or more functions of the human organism thus either
    improving the general and physical conditions or/and decreasing the risk of the
    evolution of diseases .', 'In the last years, thanks to the evolution of scientific

    specie is native to the region extending from the eastern Mediterranean, through
    Western Asia and the Middle East, to India.', 'The Latin name of flaxseed means
    "very useful", and it has two basic varieties: brown and yellow or golden .',
  'Flaxseed, of Mesopotamic origin, has been cultivated since 5000 BC, being used
    until the 1990s principally for the fabrication of cloths and papers.', 'Today
    it is cultivated in over 2.6 million ha and the important linseed growing countries
    are India, China, United States, Ethiopia.', 'Canada with 614,000 metric tonnes
    of flaxseed produced in the year 2013-2014, is the worlds largest producer of
    flax and accounts for nearly 80% of the global trade in flaxseed .', 'The whole
    flaxseed is flat and oval with pointed tips and contains a seed coat or true hull,
    a thin endosperm, two embryos and an embryo axis .', 'Every part of the linseed
    plant is utilized commercially, either directly or after processing.', 'The shell
    yields good quality fiber having high mechanical properties and low density instead
    the seed provides oil rich in omega-3, digestible proteins and lignans; it is

    soaps and numerous other products.', 'Thanks to its composition, flaxseed is emerging
    as an important functional food ingredient because provides oil rich in omega-3,
    digestible proteins, and lignans.', "In addition to being one of the richest sources
    of \u03B1-linolenic acid oil and lignans, flaxseed is an essential source of high
    quality protein and soluble fiber and has considerable potential as a source of
    phenolic compounds .", 'For human consumption, flax meal is in the form of ground
    vacuum-packed grains or flaxseed enriched products.', 'For example, flaxseed that
    can be incorporated into traditional cereal-based matrices as bread and pasta,
    in egg products, in ready-to-eat snack foods known for their high consumer acceptability

    seeds are chemically stable, but ground flaxseed can go rancid at room temperature
    in as little as one week, although there is contrary evidence.', Refrigeration
    and storage in sealed containers will keep ground flax from becoming rancid for
    a longer period., Milled flax is remarkably stable to oxidation when stored for
    nine months at room temperature if packed immediately without exposure to air
    and light and for 20 months at ambient temperatures under warehouse condition

    in reducing the number of ulcers, both flaxseed oil and mucilage were pointed
    to provide a cytoprotective effect against ethanol-induced gastric ulcers in rats
    .', Same results about antiulcer and anti-secretory properties of flaxseed oil
    were obtained by Kaitwash et al., '2010.', The oil also exhibited significant
    inhibitory effect on gastric secretion/total acidity and on aspirin-induced gastric
    ulceration in rats ., Clark WF et al 2001 studied the influence of flaxseed fatty
    acids on lupus nephritis disease., Plasma lipids and serum viscosity were unaltered
    by the flaxseed supplementation whereas serum creatinine in the compliant patients
    declined., 'Flaxseed appeared to be reno-protective in lupus nephritis, but authors
    suggested that their interpretation was affected by under powering due to poor
    adherence of patients .', 'Dupasquier et al.2007, investigated the anti-atherogenic
    capacity of flaxseed in an animal model that represents the human atherosclerotic

    and polyunsaturated fats, including omega-3 fatty acids from flaxseed, can reduce
    heart disease.', Preventing the occurrence of cardiovascular disease with nutritional
    interventions is a strategy that is widely focusing attention of researchers.,
  Rodriguez-Leyva et al., 2010 analysing epidemiological investigations and experimental
    studies suggested that ALA intake from flaxseed has been demonstrated to combat
    cardiovascular disease ., Caligiuri et al., '2014, focused on flaxseed consumption
    and blood pressure in patients with hypertension.', The objective was to examine
    whether flaxseed consumption altered plasma oxylipins in a manner that influenced
    blood pressure., "After the clinical trial, authors concluded that \u03B1-linolenic
    acid in flaxseed may have inhibited soluble epoxide hydrolase, which altered oxylipin
    concentrations that contributed to the antihypertensive effects in patients with
    peripheral arterial disease .", 'Eicosapentaenoic Acid and Docosahexaenoic Acid,
    derivatives of ALA, have cardioprotective properties.', Harper et al., 2005 studied
    the effect of daily supplementation of ALA from flaxseed on the plasma concentration
    of n-3 fatty acids in African-American population with chronic illness., Results
    demonstrate that plasma DHA levels did not change in either group; the efficacy
    of the conversion of ALA to EPA and DPA was found in a minority population with
    chronic disease ., 'Like all vegetables, flaxseed proteins have techno-functional
    properties that affect their behaviour in a food system through interaction with

    as one of the most nutritious of the plant proteins .', 'Flaxseeds are not considered
    a source of complete proteins because the lack of some essential amino acids,
    necessarily introduced from the diet.', Essential amino acids contained in flaxseed
    are shown in Figure 2., Flaxseed grain and flaxseed paste contain about 21% and
    34% protein respectively and may varies with the genetic and environmental factors
    ., Cool climates usually result in high oil and low protein content in the seeds.,
  'Flaxseed has two major storage proteins, a predominant salt soluble fraction with
    high molecular weight and a water soluble basic component with low molecular weight

    amino acids and of branched chain amino acids .', 'Flaxseed is reach in essential
    amino acids of great importance in the synthesis of proteins that have the role
    of maintenance and repair of cells, tissues and organs.', Flaxseed protein biological
    effects were rarely studied; their physiological properties were mainly explained
    by both amino acid composition and interaction with other flaxseed components.,
  'Omoni & Aluko 2006, observed that flaxseed protein hydrolysate were able to induce
    a change of secondary and tertiary structures of calmodulin, the cofactor involved
    in the production of nitric oxide responsible for several neurodegenerative diseases

    provide a new therapeutic strategy to reduce hypertriglyceridemia and fatty liver;
    further studies needed on human model ., 'Velasquez et al 2003, analyzed the impact
    of proteins on renal function and nephropathy in animal models of type II diabetes

    flaxseed meal was more effective than soy protein in reducing proteinuria and
    renal histologic abnormalities in this model ., 'Bioactive peptides, present in
    flaxseed, such as cyclolinopeptide A, have strong immunosuppressive and antimalarial
    activities, inhibiting the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum in culture
    .', According to Oomah flaxseed contained a peptide mixture with high levels of
    branched-chain amino acids and low levels of Aromatic Amino Acids., 'This mixture
    has shown antioxidant properties by scavenging 2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl

    enzyme .', 'Flaxseed meal is reach in crude, acid detergent, neutral detergent
    and total fibers.', 'Fibers content varies between 22% to 26%, twice the percentage
    of high fiber beans.', A half ounce of dry whole flax seed provides between 20%
    and 25% of your daily fiber needs., 'Flaxseed contains soluble and insoluble dietary
    fibers in a proportion that varies between 20:80 and 40:60.', The major insoluble
    fiber fraction consists of cellulose and lignin and the soluble fiber fractions
    are the mucilage gums ., 'Dietary fibers from flaxseed were found to have a direct
    relation to health in particular in body weight regulation through both hunger
    suppression and diminished nutrient absorption  generally, soluble fiber forms
    a gel when mixed with water.', 'This gel slows down the emptying of the stomach,
    potentially lowering blood glucose levels.', 'Cholesterol is also lowered as it
    is surrounded by the gel, which inhibits its absorption and leads to more cholesterol
    being excreted.', 'Ibbrugger et al 2012, conducted a crossover acute study about
    the influence of flax drink and flax tablet on hunger suppression.', Sensation
    of satiety and fullness were similar for Flax tablets and Flax drink as they did
    not differ by more than 1-4% ., Flaxseed protein demonstrated the reduction of
    the fat absorption by fecal excretion in animal and human., Mette et al., '2012
    found that addition of a flax dietary fiber extract rich in viscous dietary fibers
    significantly increased fat excretion and lowered total and LDL-cholesterol, with
    no effect on appetite .', 'Flax is low in carbohydrates, providing only 1 gram
    per 100 g. For this reason, flax contributes little to total carbohydrate intake;
    its recommended for people with specific deseases.', 'Flaxseed polysaccharide
    is composed of two major fractions: a neutral arabinoxylan and an acidic rhamnogalacturonan.',

    predominantly, in the isomer \u03B3-tocopherol.", 'Antioxidant nutrients like
    vitamin E protect cell constituents from the damaging effects of free radicals
    that, if unchecked, might contribute to cancer development.', Vitamin E might
    also block the formation of carcinogenic nitrosamines formed in the stomach from
    nitrites in foods and protect against cancer by enhancing immune function ., 'Furthermore,
    vitamin E promotes sodium excretion in the urine which may helps lower blood pressure
    and helps lower the risk of heart disease, some types of cancer and Alzheimer
    disease.', "Although \u03B1-tocopherol is preferentially absorbed in relation
    to the \u03B3 isomer; it has been considered the most effective against oxidation

    compounds, including lignans, flavonoids and phenolic acids .', 'In particular,
    flaxseeds are the richest dietary source of lignan precursors.', 'When ingested,
    lignan precursors are converted to the enterolignans, enterodiol and enterolactone,

    precursor found in flaxseed is secoisolariciresinol diglucoside ., 'Four phenolic
    acids identified in defatted flaxseed powder are ferulic acid, chlorogenic acid,
    gallic acid, and traces of 4-hydroxybenzoic acid.', The major flavonoids in flax
    are flavone C- and O- glycosides ., 'Lignan-rich foods are part of a healthful
    dietary pattern; the role of lignans is important in the prevention of hormone-associated
    cancers, osteoporosis, and cardiovascular diseases.', The flaxseed lignan secoisolariciresinol
    and its diglucoside Secoisolariciresinol Diglucoside are reported to have a number
    of health benefits associated with their consumption that have in part been attributed
    to their antioxidant properties., 'After ingestion, SDG is converted to enterolignans
    by the intestinalmicroflora; then these metabolites are absorbed and can provide
    health benefits.', Prasad 2013 investigated if SDG from flaxseed could be an alternative
    to Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme in the treatment of hypertension., In particular
    the study focused on SDG-induced hypotension through inhibition of ACE., 'After
    feeding rats with specific doses of flaxseed, SDG decreased the systolic, diastolic
    and mean arterial pressure.', Data suggested that SDG reduced the angiotensin
    I-induced rise in the arterial pressures and hence SDG was a potent ACE inhibitor

    lignans and oil components in reducing breast cancer risk and tumour growth.',
  'In vitro, animal, observational, and clinical studies on FS and its lignan and
    oil components were reviewed.', Results showed that flaxseed intake reduces tumour
    growth in breast cancer patients., Mechanisms included decreased cell proliferation
    and angiogenesis and increased apoptosis through modulation of estrogen metabolism
    and estrogen receptor and growth factor receptor signalling pathways., More clinical
    trials are needed to indicate that flaxseed components are effective in the risk
    reduction and treatment of breast cancer .The systematic review by Flower et al.,
  2013 considered lignans and other flaxseed compounds to check the efficacy in improving
    menopausal symptoms in women living with breast cancer and for potential impact
    on risk of breast cancer incidence or recurrence., 'Making a comparison among

    risk of breast cancer.', 'Furthermore, flax demonstrated anti-proliferative effects
    in breast tissue of women at risk of breast cancer.', Mortality risk may also
    be reduced among those living with breast cancer ., 'Despite acting as an inhibitor
    to the development of cancer, recent evidence has shown that lignan and flaxseed
    oil reduced the growth of tamoxifen treated tumors by mechanisms involving signaling
    pathways, suggesting their potential use to aid in chemotherapy of some cancer
    types.', Saggar et al., '2010, analyzed the effect of dietary flaxseed lignan

    by interfering with DNA, RNA and/or protein synthesis .', 'Moreover, lignan cytotoxicity
    on normal immune cells appears to be low.', 'Lignans may also exert fungistatic,
    cytotoxic, antiviral activities and a hormonal modulation, causing a decrease
    in hot flashes which are characteristic of menopause .', Simbalista et al., 2010
    tested the effects of daily intake of bread produced with defatted ground flaxseed
    on the climacteric symptoms and endometrial thickness of postmenopausal women.,
  Authors concluded that flaxseed consumption at certain levels l was effective as
    well as placebo for reducing hot flashes ., 'Lignans may reduce the level of free
    circulating testosterone and when bonded together are excreted in the bile, potentially
    reducing the risk of polycystic ovary syndrome in susceptible women, since this
    syndrome is associated to high levels of androgens.', Nowak et al., '2007, described
    the clinical case study based on the impact of flaxseed supplementation on hormonal
    levels in a 31-year old woman with polycystic ovary syndrome.', The clinically
    and significant decrease in androgen levels and the concomitant reduction in hirsutism
    viewed in patients demonstrated a need for further research of flaxseed supplementation
    on hormonal levels and clinical symptoms of polycystic ovary syndrome ., Competition
    of lignans with estrogen for receptor sites causes dual effects., 'Considering
    that lignan possesses a weak hormonal action, during phases of life when there
    is a large production of estrogen, the chronic ingestion of flaxseed may exert
    an antiestrogenic action because it competes with estrogen for the same receptors.',
  'By means of this mechanism, flaxseed may protect women with risk of cancer by decreasing
    hormonal signalization involved in the beginning of tumor development Consuming
    lignans may lower the risk of endometrial cancer in post-menopausal women, and
    it might also help reduce the severity of osteoporosis.', Dew et al., 2013 sistematic
    review controlled flax interventions on menopausal symptoms and bone health in
    premenopausal and postmenopausal women., "The majority of studies considered suggested
    that flax consumption alters circulating sex hormones and increased the urinary
    2\u03B1-hydroxyestrone/16\u03B1-hydroxyestrone ratio associated with a lower risk
    of breast cancer.", 'However, few studies considered bone mineral density or markers
    of bone turnover; more investigation needed to confirm influence of flax lignan

    the inhibitors trypsin, myo-inositol phosphate, cadmium, and cyanogenic glycosides
    , phytoestrogens with adverse health effects and toxic compounds has to be underlined.',
  'Infact, in addition to bioactive compounds, flaxseed contains 264-354 mg of cyanogenic
    compounds per 100 g of seed, being 10-11.8 mg of linamarin/100 g, 136-162 mg of
    linustatin/100 g, and 105-183 mg of neolinustatin/100 g of flaxseed.', These compounds
    are toxic to the human organism and it is estimated that ingestion of 100 mg may
    be lethal to adult individuals., Cyanogenic glucosides are nitrogenous secondary
    plant metabolites derived from amino acids., 'Their causes chronic effects, manifested
    in the nervous system and are observed in populations that ingest high quantities
    of cyanate in foods .', 'However, these compounds present instability when subjected
    to thermal and mechanical processes, including cooking in microwaves, autoclaving,
    and boiling .', Cadmium is potentially toxic to the human organism., 'When accumulated
    in the kidney, this metal can cause renal dysfunction, as well as pulmonary emphysema,
    aminoaciduria, glycosuria, phosphaturia and even compromise mineral reabsorption,
    making organisms susceptible to osteomalacia.', 'Trypsin inhibitors present in
    the diet have been known for decades to diminish growth in animals, since they
    decrease the digestion and consequent absorption of proteins by the inhibition
    of proteases .', Trypsin inhibitor activity in flaxseed was low when compared
    to those in soybean and canola seeds., Bhatty reported laboratory-prepared flaxseed
    meals containing 42 to 51 units of TIA ., 'Knowing that these compounds present
    instability when subjected to thermal and mechanical processes, including cooking
    in microwaves, autoclaving, and boiling its consumption is recommended in the
    form of flour because the concentrations of compounds with adverse effects are
    eliminated or reduced; furthermore the trituration of the seed increases bioavailability
    of the bioactive compounds .', Flaxseed has nutritional and functional properties.,
  'In fact the content of compounds such as polyunsaturated fatty acids, essential
    amino acids, vitamin E, lignans and dietary fibers makes flaxseed a source to
    satisfy basic needs in the human diet and health maintenance.', 'Healthy properties
    are related to anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, anti-carcinogenic activities and
    to the lowering of cholesterol, the decrease of cardiovascular disease and the
    prevention of diabetes.', 'However, in state of functional properties, flaxseed
    contains low quantities of adverse healthy compounds such as cadmium, cyanogenic
    glycosides, inhibitors of trypsin that are commonly removed through thermal and
    mechanical processes, including cooking in microwaves, autoclaving and boiling.']
