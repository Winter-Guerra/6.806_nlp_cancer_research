['6-(methylsulfinyl)hexyl isothiocyanate is a bioactive ingredient of wasabi, which
    is a popular spice in Japan.', 6-MSITC has been reported to inhibit the proliferation
    of breast cancer and melanoma cell lines., 'We inoculated 30 female Balb-nu/nu
    mice with MDA-MB-231 or -453 cells, and orally administered varying concentrations
    of 6-MSITC for 12 days following tumor growth.', 'The tumor volumes and tumor
    weights from mice inoculated with MDA-MB-231 cells, and the tumor volumes of MDA-MB-453
    cells were significantly inhibited by 6-MSITC on Days 9 and 11 after drug administration.',
  'DNA fragmentation, DNA ladder, and caspase 3/7 activity performed in vitro revealed
    that 6-MSITC induced apoptosis of MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-453, and MCF-7 cells.', "Furthermore,
    nuclear factor-\u03BAB expression in the nuclei and phosphorylation of inhibitor
    \u03BAB\u03B1 was downregulated by 6-MSITC in a concentration-dependent manner;
    however, this activity was not observed in MCF-7 cells.", "Moreover, this downregulation
    of phosphorylated I\u03BAB\u03B1 by 6-MSITC in MDA-MB-231 and -453 cells supports
    its inhibitory effects on NF-\u03BAB activity.", The expression of phosphorylated
    AKT reduced by 6-MSITC was confirmed in MDA-MB-231 cells., 'Thus, we conclude
    that 6-MITC promotes apoptosis of breast cancer cells by inhibiting NF-kB and
    therefore releasing its control of the PI3K/AKT pathway.']
