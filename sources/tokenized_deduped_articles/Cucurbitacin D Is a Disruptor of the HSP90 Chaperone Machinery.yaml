['Heat shock protein 90 facilitates the maturation of many newly synthesized and unfolded
    proteins via the Hsp90 chaperone cycle, in which Hsp90 forms a heteroprotein complex
    and relies upon cochaperones, immunophilins, etc., for assistance in client folding.',
  Hsp90 inhibition has emerged as a strategy for anticancer therapies due to the involvement
    of clients in many oncogenic pathways., 'Inhibition of chaperone function results
    in client ubiquitinylation and degradation via the proteasome, ultimately leading
    to tumor digression.', Small molecule inhibitors perturb ATPase activity at the
    N-terminus and include derivatives of the natural product geldanamycin., 'However,
    N-terminal inhibition also leads to induction of the pro-survival heat shock response,
    in which displacement of the Hsp90-bound transcription factor, heat shock factor-1,
    translocates to the nucleus and induces transcription of heat shock proteins,
    including Hsp90.', An alternative strategy for Hsp90 inhibition is disruption
    of the Hsp90 heteroprotein complex., Disruption of the Hsp90 heteroprotein complex
    is an effective strategy to prevent client maturation without induction of the
    HSR., 'Cucurbitacin D, isolated from Cucurbita texana, and 3-epi-isocucurbitacin

  "Hsp90 is a molecular chaperone responsible for the correct conformation of many
    newly synthesized polypeptides and the rematuration of denatured proteins termed
    \u201Cclients\u201D via the Hsp90 chaperone cycle.", 'Hsp90 functions as a homodimer
    and requires the formation of the heteroprotein complex composed of several immunophilins,

  '(1, 2) Inhibition of the chaperone cycle leads to client protein ubiquiltinylation
    and subsequent degradation via the proteasome.', (3-5) Hsp90 inhibition has emerged
    as a strategy for anticancer chemotherapeutics due to the involvement of Hsp90-dependent
    clients in a variety of oncogenic signaling pathways., (6-11) Many clients are
    contributors to the six hallmarks of cancer., Oncogenic client degradation via
    Hsp90 inhibition ultimately halts cancer progression and has been observed during
    clinical trials of Hsp90 inhibitors., 'Classic small molecule Hsp90 inhibitors
    are designed to perturb N-terminal ATPase activity and include derivatives of
    geldanamycin, radicicol, and several purine analogs.', '(12) Although Hsp90 N-terminal
    inhibitors are effective at inhibiting Hsp90 function and lead to tumor digression
    through client degradation, N-terminal inhibition also leads to displacement of
    the Hsp90-bound transcription factor, heat shock factor-1, and induction of the
    pro-survival heat shock response.', '(13-16) Upon displacement, HSF-1 trimerizes,
    translocates to the nucleus, and induces transcription of the heat shock element.',
  'This leads to increases in the cellular concentration of heat shock proteins, including
    Hsp90, and resulted in dosing and scheduling problems during clinical trials of
    N-terminal inhibitors.', 'Therefore, anticancer Hsp90 inhibitors that avoid induction
    of the HSR are needed.', Alternative strategies to inhibit the chaperone cycle
    include targeting the Hsp90 C-terminus and disruption of the heteroprotein complex.,
  C-Terminal inhibitors include derivatives of the coumarin-containing natural product
    novobiocin., "(17-20) These inhibitors prevent cancer cell proliferation at concentrations
    similar to N-terminal inhibitors and destabilize Hsp90\u2013client protein interactions
    without induction of the HSR.", Maturation of all clients requires additional
    proteins that interact with Hsp90 and modulate ATPase activity and/or assist in
    correct client folding., "(21, 22) For example, the cochaperone Hsp90\u2013Hsp70
    organizing protein associates with the Hsp90 dimer during the initial stages of
    the chaperone cycle and facilitates the delivery of certain clients from Hsp70
    to Hsp90.", "Peptidyl\u2013prolyl isomerase cochaperones assist in the correct
    folding and 3-diminsional structure of clients, and the cochaperone p23 promotes
    the optimal Hsp90 conformation for ATP binding and hydrolysis, ultimately resulting
    in client protein release.", '(23) In addition, classes of clients require the
    assistance of specific cochaperones for maturation for maturation).', 'Disruption
    of interactions between Hsp90 and client-specific cochaperones may allow for select
    degradation of clients and avoid systemic client protein degradation, a consequence
    of Hsp90 inhibitors under current clinical investigation, and may be the cause
    of certain side effects.', The cucurbitacin class of natural products is a group
    of triterpenoids that are present in the Cucurbitaceae and other closely related
    families., 'More than 50 cucurbitacins have been identified and exhibit a wide
    variety of biological activities that include, but are not limited to, cytotoxicity,
    antiproliferation, anti-inflammation, antioxidant, antihepatotoxicity, antibacterial,
    and antiviral properties, as well as antimetastatic properties and improved anticancer
    activity when combined with current chemotherapies.', "(24-26) Despite the presence
    of an \u03B1-, \u03B2-unsaturated ketone located within many of the cucurbitacin
    compounds, several cucurbitacins interact with specific cellular targets involved
    in gene regulation, transcription, and overall cellular fate.", Cucurbitacin D
    reduced the proliferation of T-cell leukemia cells and ultimately led to cancer
    cell apoptosis., "(27) This cucurbitacin was shown to affect the NF-\u03BAB pathway
    and led to the accumulation of NF-\u03BAB and I\u03BAB-\u03B1 within the cytosol.",
  'Interestingly, a decrease in the cellular levels of Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 was also observed.',
  Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 levels are regulated by Hsp90 clients that depend on the chaperone
    cycle for correct folding and function., It has been reported that incubation
    with N-terminal inhibitors led to cellular decreases in Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 levels.,
  '(28, 29) Furthermore, 4, as well as other cucurbitacins, share structural similarities
    to the natural products celastrol and gedunin, which are known inhibitors of client
    maturation via disruption of the Hsp90 heteroprotein complex.', 'However, these
    natural products inhibit chaperone function by different mechanisms.', '2 covalently
    binds the Hsp90 N-terminus and disrupts the interaction between Hsp90 and Cdc37,
    ultimately resulting in kinase client degradation.', '(30) 3 binds the cochapreone
    p23 and disrupts Hsp90-cochaperone interactions, leading to client degradation
    across many different cancer cell lines.', '(31) Given certain structural similarities
    between the cucurbitacins, 2 and 3, as well as decreased levels of proteins that
    depend on functional clients after exposure to cucurbitacins, it was hypothesized
    that 4, and other cucurbitains, may inhibit the Hsp90 chaperone cycle in a manner
    similar to 2 and/or 3.', 'Herein, we report that 4 prevented the maturation of
    Hsp90-dependent clients by disruption of the Hsp90 heteroprotein complex.', 'With
    the exception of 23,24-dihydrocucurbitacin D and 23,24-dihydrocucurbitacin B,
    all cucurbitacins exhibited antiproliferative IC50 values at nanomolar concentrations
    against the MCF7 breast cancer cell line.', Western blot analysis for client levels
    in the presence of high and low concentrations of each cucurbitacin revealed that
    incubation with 4 and 3-epi-isocucurbitacin D led to client degradation., '4 also
    disrupted the interaction between Hsp90 and the cochaperones Cdc37 and p23; however,
    6 did not disrupt these Hsp90-co-chaperone interactions components and caused
    client degradation through alternative mechanism(s).', 'Furthermore, 4 did not
    induce the HSR, as no increases in the levels of heat shock proteins Hsp90, Hsp70,
    or Hsp27 was observed.', 'Client protein degradation, disruption of Hsp90-Cdc37
    and Hsp90-p23 interactions as well as a lack of heat shock protein induction,
    notably Hsp27, has previously been observed after incubation with 3 and suggested
    4 inhibited cancer cell growth through Hsp90 client degradation via disruption
    of Hsp90-co-chaperone interactions by a mechanism comparable to 3.', 'Cucurbitacin
    D and cucurbitacin B, along with isomeric 3-epi-isocucurbitacin D, were isolated
    from the fruits of Cucurbita texana following previously described protocols.',
  '(32-34) Two additional oxidized derivatives, cucurbitacin I and E, were obtained
    as well.', These latter compounds along with 6 were obtained in reduced quantities
    compared to that of 4 and 5., 'Fortunately, semisynthetic approaches to these
    particular compounds have been investigated in the literature and can be seen
    as a solution to the lack of material for these natural products.', "In addition,
    9, 10, and other reduced C23\u201324 derivatives have routinely been acquired
    via hydrogenation conditions.", Structures of the isolated and semisynthesized
    cucurbitacins of interest are shown in Figure 2., Figure 2., Chemical structures

    Galindo and co-workers.", "(35, 36) However, an alternative to Galindo\u2019s
    procedure was chosen instead, one similar to that reported by Sneden et al.",
  that takes advantage of the slightly acidic nature of silica gel., "(37) Heating

    moiety for cucurbitacins,(39-41) this is the first example of the transformation
    via a Saegusa oxidation.", '(42-45) This result can be rationalized via the ability
    of cucurbitacins to isomerize to form the intermediate enediol, which can be trapped
    and oxidized to the final diosphenol product.', This is the same enediol intermediate
    that is necessary for the formation of isocucurbitacins., 'While 7 was not the
    initially desired product, the resulting extra quantity was now available for
    biological testing.', 'To date, Cucurbita texana has not produced any 9 or 10
    via natural product isolation.', "However, hydrogenation of the C23\u201324 olefin
    of 4 and 5 has allowed for the ability to obtain useful quantities of the semisynthesized
