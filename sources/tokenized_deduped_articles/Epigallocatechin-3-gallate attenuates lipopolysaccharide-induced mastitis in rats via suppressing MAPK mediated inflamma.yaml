[Green tea is an extremely popular beverage worldwide., 'Epigallocatechin-3-gallate
    is one of the major catechins isolated from green tea and contributes to its beneficial
    therapeutic functions including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer
    effects.', 'However, the effect of EGCG on mastitis is not yet known.', This study
    was to investigate the protective potential of EGCG against mastitis in rats.,
  The rat mastitis model was induced by injecting lipopolysaccharide into the duct
    of mammary gland., The mammary gland was collected after the experimental period.,
  The levels of mammary oxidative stress and inflammatory responses were assessed
    by measuring the local activities of antioxidant enzymes and the levels of inflammatory
    cytokines., "The mammary expressions of mitogen-activated protein kinases, nuclear
    factor \xCE\xBAB-p65 and hypoxia-inducible factor-1\xCE\xB1 were evaluated by
    western blot analysis.", It was found that EGCG obviously normalized LPS-induced
    low activities of antioxidant enzymes as well as decreased the high levels of
    inflammatory cytokines., "Additionally, EGCG inhibited the mammary over-expression
    of MAPKs, NF\xCE\xBAB-p65 and HIF-1\xCE\xB1.", These results indicated that EGCG
    was able to attenuate LPS-induced mastitis in rats by suppressing MAPK related
    oxidative stress and inflammatory responses.]
