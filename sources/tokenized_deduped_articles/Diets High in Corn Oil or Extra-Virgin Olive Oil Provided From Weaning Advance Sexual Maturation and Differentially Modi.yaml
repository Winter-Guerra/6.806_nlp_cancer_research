['Based on the importance of early-life events in breast cancer risk, we have investigated
    the effects of high-fat diets on maturation, mammary gland development, and its
    susceptibility to transformation.', 'Female Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a lowfat,
    high corn oil, or high extra-virgin olive oil diet from weaning and gavaged with
    7,12-dimethylbenzanthracene.', Body weight and mass increased in the HCO group
    compared to the LF group., 'The vaginal opening was advanced in both high-fat
    groups, especially in the HCO group.', 'This HCO group also had increased body
    weight around puberty, more corpora lutea at post-puberty, and tended to have
    higher kisspeptin levels in the hypothalamus.', "Both high-fat diets induced subtle
    modifications in the morphology of the mammary gland, with no changes on \u03B2-casein
    or hormone receptors expression in the gland.", 'The HCO diet had a clearly stimulating
    effect of carcinogenesis, inducing the earliest appearance of tumors and the highest
    tumor incidence and yield, whereas the HOO diet seemed to have a weak enhancing
    effect, increasing tumor yield.', 'Our data suggest a strong influence of the
    HCO diet in sexual maturation and mammary cancer risk, while rats fed the HOO
    diet were more similar to the controls.']
