['Since eradication of Helicobacter pylori is thought to be a preventive measure against
    stomach cancer, several studies have examined factors associated with the infection.',
  This paper reports the association of the infection with lifestyle factors observed
    in a hospital-based case-control study., Cases were 140 anti-H. pylori IgG antibody-positive
    outpatients., Controls were 52 antibody-negative outpatients., 'Both groups had
    undergone gastroscopy at Aichi Cancer Center Hospital between February 1995 and
    February 1997, and lifestyle data collected on the first visit were linked to
    calculate odds ratios.', 'A strong association was observed with smoking among
    males; age-adjusted odds ratio = 7.85, 95% confidence interval, 2.03-30.4.', 'Rice
    breakfast and soybean paste soup were also associated with antibody positivity
    in males, but not in females.', 'In females, pickled Chinese cabbage and lettuce
    were significantly associated with positivity.', Multivariate analysis gave similar
    estimates for the above factors., 'Although the association between smoking and
    H. pylori infection has not been detected in past studies of a general population,
    except one recent one, this study on outpatients suggested a possible association.',
  Smoking may work as a cofactor disturbing incidental eradication of H. pylori by
    antibacterial agents administered for other reasons.]
