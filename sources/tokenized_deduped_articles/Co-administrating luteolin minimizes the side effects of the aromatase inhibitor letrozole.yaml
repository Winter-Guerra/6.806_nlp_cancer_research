[Aromatase inhibitors have been used as adjuvant therapeutic agents for breast cancer.,
  Their adverse side effect on blood lipid is well documented., Some natural compounds
    have been shown to be potential AIs., 'In the present study, we compared the efficacy
    of the flavonoid luteolin to the clinically approved AI letrozole in a cell and
    a mouse model.', "In the in vitro experimental results for aromatase inhibition,
    the Ki values of luteolin and letrozole were estimated to be 2.44 \xB5M and 0.41
    nM, respectively.", Both letrozole and luteolin appeared to be competitive inhibitors.,
  'Subsequently, an animal model was used for the comparison.', Aromatase-expressing
    MCF-7 cells were transplanted into ovariectomized athymic mice., 'Luteolin was
    given by mouth at 5, 20, and 50 mg/kg, whereas letrozole was administered by intravenous
    injection.', 'Similar to letrozole, luteolin administration reduced plasma estrogen
    concentrations and suppressed the xenograft proliferation.', "The regulation of
    cell cycle and apoptotic proteins\u2014such as a decrease in the expression of
    Bcl-xL, cyclin-A/D1/E, CDK2/4, and increase in that of Bax\u2014was about the
    same in both treatments.", The most significant disparity was on blood lipids.,
  'In contrast to letrozole, luteolin increased fasting plasma high-density lipoprotein
    concentrations and produced a desirable blood lipid profile.', These results suggested
    that the flavonoid could be a coadjuvant therapeutic agent without impairing the
    action of AIs.]
