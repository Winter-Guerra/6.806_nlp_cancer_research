['Inconsistency in findings from studies on soy intake and breast cancer risk, particularly
    among Western populations, has given greater weight to concerns about the safety
    of soy consumption.', 'We prospectively examined associations between soy consumption
    and breast cancer incidence by Cox proportional hazards regression, controlling
    for important confounders.', 'Of 62,511 Seventh-day Adventist women recruited,
    50,288 participants remained after exclusions.', Soy consumption was assessed
    at baseline by a quantitative FFQ., New breast cancer cases through 2011 were
    identified by record linkage with data from 48 state cancer registries., There
    were 892 new breast cancer cases during a mean follow-up of 7.87 years., 'Intake
    of soy protein, soy isoflavones, soybeans and tofu, soymilk, and meat analogues
    were lower among women with breast cancer than those without cancer.', Subjects
    in the highest soy protein intake quintile compared the lowest quintile had a
    21% reduced risk of developing breast cancer., Women in the highest quintile of
    total isoflavones intake had a 22% reduced risk of breast cancer compared to those
    with a median intake of 1.15 mg/d., 'For soybeans and tofu, soy milk and meat
    analogues, there was a suggestion that greater intake compared to the lowest quintile
    of intake could be protective, but the effect sizes were smaller as these represented
    only portions of the total soy intake.', 'In conclusion, soy intake is associated
    with reduced risk of breast cancer in a largely Caucasian and African-American
    population from North America.']
