[We evaluated the effect of cultivar and solar radiation on the melatonin content
    of Capsicum annuum and Solanum lycopersicum fruits., "The melatonin content of
    red pepper fruits ranged from 31 to 93 ng g\u22121.", "The melatonin content of
    tomato ranged from 7.5 to 250 ng g\u22121.", We also studied the effect of ripeness
    on melatonin content and identified one group of pepper cultivars in which the
    melatonin content increased as the fruit ripened and another in which it decreased
    as the fruit ripened., 'Under shade conditions, the melatonin content in most
    of tomato cultivars tended to increase, whereas that of most pepper cultivars
    decreased.', 'Overall, the results also demonstrated that the melatonin content
    of the fruits was not related to carbon fluxes from leaves.']
