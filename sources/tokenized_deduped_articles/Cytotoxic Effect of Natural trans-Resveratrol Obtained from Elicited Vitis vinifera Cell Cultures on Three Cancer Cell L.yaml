[trans-Resveratrol has been reported to be a potential cancer chemopreventive agent.,
  'Although its cytotoxic activity against different cancer cell lines has been tested,
    its effect on human acute leukemia cell lines has scarcely been investigated,
    and only a few in vitro studies were performed using human breast epithelial cell
    lines.', 'Due to its potential value for human health, demand for trans-R has
    rapidly increased, and new biotechnological strategies to obtain it from natural
    edible sources have been developed.', 'Thus, grapevine cell cultures represent
    a reliable system of trans-R production since they biosynthesize trans-R constitutively
    or in response to elicitation.', 'In addition, there are no studies deepen on
    the inhibitory effect of trans-R, produced by elicited grapevine cell cultures,
    on growth of human tumor cell lines.', 'In this work, the effect of trans-R extracted
    from the culture medium, after elicitation of grapevine cell cultures, was tested
    on two human acute lymphocytic and monocytic leukemia cell lines, and one human
    breast cancer cell line.', 'The effect of trans-R on cell proliferation was not
    only dose- and time-dependent but also cell type-dependent, as seen from the different
    degrees of susceptibility of cancer cell lines tested.', "As regards the effect
    of trans-R on cell cycle distribution, low trans-R concentrations increased cells
    in the S phase whereas a high trans-R concentration increased G\u2080/G\u2081
    phase in all cell lines.", 'Perturbation of the cell cycle at low trans-R concentrations
    did not correlate with the induction of cell death, whereas a high trans-R concentration,
    cell proliferation decreased as a result of increasing apoptosis in the three
    cell lines.', 'In leukemia cells, trans-R up-regulated the expression of caspase-3
    while trans-R-induced apoptosis in breast cells occur through a caspase-3-independent
    mechanism mediated by a down-regulation of Bcl-2.']
