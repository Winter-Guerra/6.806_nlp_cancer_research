[The protective effect of dietary carotenoid intake on the risk of breast cancer is
    inconclusive., 'Moreover, data on dietary carotenoids in relation to breast cancer
    in non-Western populations are scarce.', The aim of the present study was to examine
    the association between dietary carotenoid intake and the risk of breast cancer
    among Chinese women., A total of 561 cases and 561 controls who were frequency
    matched by age and residence were recruited in the present case-control study.,
  Dietary intake information was collected by a face-to-face interview using a validated
    FFQ., The OR and 95 % CI were assessed by multivariate logistic regression after
    adjusting for various potential confounders., "An inverse association was observed
    between the consumption of \u03B1-carotene, \u03B2-carotene, \u03B2-cryptoxanthin
    and lutein/zeaxanthin and the risk of breast cancer.", "The multivariate-adjusted
    OR for the highest quartile of intake compared with the lowest quartile of intake
    were 0\xB761 for \u03B1-carotene, 0\xB754 for \u03B2-carotene, 0\xB738 for \u03B2-cryptoxanthin
    and 0\xB749 for lutein/zeaxanthin.", "Lycopene intake was not found to be associated
    with the risk of breast cancer, with the adjusted OR of 0\xB789.", These inverse
    associations were more evident among pre-menopausal women and women who were exposed
    to second-hand smoke., The protective effect of specific carotenoid intake was
    observed for all subtypes of hormone receptor status of breast cancer., The present
    study indicated that a greater intake of specific carotenoids was associated with
    a decreased risk of breast cancer among Chinese women residing in Guangdong.]
