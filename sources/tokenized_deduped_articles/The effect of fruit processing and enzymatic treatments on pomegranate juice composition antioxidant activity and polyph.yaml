['Pomegranate fruit and pomegranate juices have recently received great attention
    for their health benefits, mainly due to their high polyphenols content and the
    related antioxidant capacity.', 'Nevertheless, the pomegranate processing and
    its effects on juice composition has been only little investigated.', 'In this
    paper two important steps of pomegranate juice production, the separation of arils
    from peels and the enzymatic clarification of the juice, were considered, and
    the characterization of pomegranate juices obtained in different cleaning and
    clarification conditions was reported.', 'Results showed that the cleaning procedures
    largely affect the juice composition and its organoleptic properties, and a significant
    positive correlation was found among peels content before pressing, total polyphenols,
    antioxidant capacity and perceived bitterness of the juice.', 'Juice with endocarp
    and mesocarp content of 2 and 10 g/100 g and only mesocarp of 10 g/100 g showed
    a TEAC value of 14.1 and 13.1 mmol/L, respectively, significantly higher compared
    to juice with no peels.', 'Treatment with pectolytic enzymes resulted in a better
    extraction of all the fruit components, as polyphenols and a decrease of turbidity.']
