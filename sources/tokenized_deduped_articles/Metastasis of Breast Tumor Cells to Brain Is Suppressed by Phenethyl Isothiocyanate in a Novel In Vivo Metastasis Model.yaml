[Breast tumor metastasis is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide., Breast
    tumor cells frequently metastasize to brain and initiate severe therapeutic complications.,
  The chances of brain metastasis are further elevated in patients with HER2 overexpression.,
  'In the current study, we evaluated the anti-metastatic effects of phenethyl isothiocyanate
    in a novel murine model of breast tumor metastasis.', The MDA-MB-231-BR breast
    tumor cells stably transfected with luciferase were injected into the left ventricle
    of mouse heart and the migration of cells to brain was monitored using a non-invasive
    IVIS bio-luminescent imaging system., "In order to study the efficacy of PEITC
    in preventing the number of tumor cells migrating to brain, mice were given 10
    \xB5mol PEITC by oral gavage for ten days prior to intra-cardiac injection of
    tumor cells labeled with quantum dots.", "To evaluate the tumor growth suppressive
    effects, 10 \xB5mol PEITC was given to mice every day starting 14th day after
    intra-cardiac cell injection.", 'Based on the presence of quantum dots in the
    brain section of control and treated mice, our results reveal that PEITC significantly
    prevented the metastasis of breast cancer cells to brain.', Our results demonstrate
    that the growth of metastatic brain tumors in PEITC treated mice was about 50%
    less than that of control., "According to Kaplan Meir\u2019s curve, median survival
    of tumor bearing mice treated with PEITC was prolonged by 20.5%.", 'Furthermore
    as compared to controls, we observed reduced HER2, EGFR and VEGF expression in
    the brain sections of PEITC treated mice.', 'To the best of our knowledge, our
    study for the first time demonstrates the anti-metastatic effects of PEITC in
    vivo in a novel breast tumor metastasis model and provides the rationale for further
    clinical investigation.', 'Citation: Gupta P, Adkins C, Lockman P, Srivastava

    if PEITC can suppress the migration of breast cancer cells to brain., "To address
    this question, MDA-MB-231 cells were tagged with quantum dots and then these cells

    on the average counts of quantum dots in each mouse brain, our results showed
    about 50% reduction in brain metastasis of breast cancer cells in PEITC treated

  'After observing the reduced metastasis in PEITC treated mice, next step was to
    see whether PEITC could suppress the growth of metastasized tumors in brain.',
  "Two weeks after the breast tumor cells were lodged in the brain and started growing
    as indicated by the reappearance of luminescence in the brain, mice were treated
    with 10 \xB5mol PEITC by oral gavage every day for 25 days.", 'Our results reveal
    that the luminescence in the brain was relatively less in mice treated with PEITC,
    as compared to the control mice over the period of time.', "At the end of the
    experiment, tumor growth in the brain was suppressed by almost 50\u201355% by
    PEITC treatment, indicating the tumor growth suppressive effects of PEITC.", 'Interestingly,
    luminescence was also observed at places other than the brain in the mice indicating
    that tumor cells metastasized to other sites.', 'However, PEITC treatment substantially
    blocked the growth of these minor metastatic tumors as well.', 'To evaluate the
    mechanism of the overall inhibitory effects of PEITC on the growth of metastatic
    breast tumors in the brain, brain sections from control and PEITC treated mice
    were examined by immunofluorescence.', 'Our results show significantly reduced
    expressions of HER2, EGFR and VEGF in the brain sections of PEITC treated mice
    as compared to control mice.', 'Based on these observations, it is imperative
    that PEITC not only can block the metastasis but also can suppress the growth
    of metastasized breast tumors.', (A) The MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells that reach
    brain start developing tumors after 14th day of intra-cardiac injection., The

    for HER2, EGFR and VEGF was quantitated using SlideBook software.', DAPI was used
    as internal control., 'P&lt;0.05, statistically different when compared with control.',
  "Results are presented as mean \xB1 SD of triplicates.", 'Since PEITC significantly
    reduced the metastasis and growth of metastatic tumors, we hypothesized that PEITC
    could prolong the survival of breast tumor bearing mice.', 'To test our hypothesis,
    we conducted a survival study in mice that were bearing metastatic breast tumors
    in the brain.', Mice were injected with MDA-MB-231 cells through intracardiac
    route., 'Fourteen days after tumor cell injection, PEITC treatment started in
    the treatment group while the other group was given vehicle under similar conditions
    and served as control.', "Treatment continued until all the control mice died
    and survival curve was plotted using Kaplan Meier\u2019s analysis.", Our results
    show that mice in control group started dying from day 39 onwards., The median
    survival time of mice in control group was 41.5 days., 'However, the survival
    of PEITC-treated mice was prolonged by 20.5%, with a median survival time of 50
    days.', 'Interestingly, not all the mice died in PEITC-treated group by the end
    of the experiment.', 'These observations suggest that due to its anti-metastatic
    potential, PEITC could be helpful in protracting the survival of breast cancer
    patients.', "After two weeks of intra-cardiac injection of MDA-MB-231 cells, mice
    in treatment group were gavaged with 10 \xB5mol PEITC orally every day till all
    the mice from control group were dead.", "Based on the data obtained, percent
    mice surviving at each time point were plotted using Kaplan Meier\u2019s survival
    curve using Prism 5.0.", "All the control mice bearing brain metastasis of MDA-MB-231
    breast tumor cells died between 38\u201340 days after injection.", 'P&lt;0.05,
    statistically different when compared with control.', Metastasis is a multistep
    process involving cell migration and invasion of tumor cells to distant organs
    from primary sites., The wound healing data shows inhibition of breast cancer
    cell migration by PEITC treatment., "The anti-cell invasive effects of PEITC were
    confirmed by cell invasion assay using Boyden\u2019s chamber.", 'In this experiment,
    effect of PEITC was evaluated on the capacity of breast cancer cells to invade
    through the membrane pores.', 'Since HER2 has been known to be involved in tumor
    metastasis, we first wanted to see whether HER2 alone could increase the invasion
    of MDA-MB-231 cells.', 'For this purpose, we used MDA-MB-231 cells stably overexpressing
    HER2).', We observed that HER2 overexpression increased the invasion of MDA-MB-231
    cells by 1.4 fold., 'However, PEITC treatment suppressed the invasion of MDA-MB-231
    cells by 50% and MDA-MB-231 cells by 40%.', In our recent studies we have demonstrated
    that PEITC suppresses the growth of MDA-MB-231 cells by reducing the expression
    of HER2 ., These results together with our previous observations suggest that
    PEITC targets HER2 to suppress the migration and invasion of breast cancer cells
    and hence metastasis., "Invasion assay was performed using Boyden\u2019s transwell
    chamber.", Comparison of the invasion potential of MDA-MB-231 cells with the MDA-MB-231
    parent cells., "Effect of 5 \xB5M PEITC treatment on invasion of MDA-MB-231 and
    MDA-MB-231 high HER2 cells.", Results are representative of three independent
    experiments., Statistically significant when compared with control., Current study
    provides the first evidence for the anti-metastatic effects of PEITC in vivo.,
  Observations from pretreatment model suggested that PEITC treatment significantly
    prevents the migration of breast cancer cell to brain in vivo., 'Based on these
    observations, we asked a question whether PEITC can suppress tumor growth in brain
    from the breast cancer cells that migrated to brain.', Indeed oral administration
    of PEITC not only suppressed the growth of metastasized tumor in brain but also
    prolonged the survival of tumor bearing mice., The wound healing and Transwell
    cell invasion assay also suggested that PEITC suppresses cell migration and invasion
    of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells., 'Although, the MDA-MB-231 cells overexpressing
    HER2 have higher invasive potential, PEITC effectively suppressed migration of
    these cells as well.', Our results indicate that PEITC can suppress metastasis
    of breast cancer cells in a preclinical model and provide further rationale for
    the clinical investigation of PEITC., "Breast cancer is a diverse disease, where
    almost 10\u201315% patients suffer from distant metastasis usually within three
    years of initial primary tumor , .", Brain is one of the preferential sites of
    breast cancer metastasis., 'Importantly, due to the inability of most therapeutics
    to cross blood brain barrier, the brain virtually becomes an incubation site for
    metastasized breast cancer cells.', 'In most of the breast cancer patients, these
    tumor cells usually reside in brain un-diagnosed due to their undetectable size
    or dormancy.', About 30% of patients revealed CNS metastasis of breast cancer
    after death ., 'In our current study, we observed that PEITC treatment reduced
    the number of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells reaching the brain by 50% in mice.',
  'Since PEITC also suppressed the proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells, cytotoxic effects
    of PEITC on these cells while in circulation cannot be ruled out.', 'This outcome
    provides an indication that PEITC effectively reduces cancer cell migration to
    brain, hence suppresses tumor metastasis.', 'There are reports suggesting few
    treatment options for preventing breast cancer metastasis to bones , , but this
    is the first study where the prevention of brain metastasis has been shown by
    a chemical inhibitor present in commonly used vegetables.', 'The brain tumor developed
    from metastasized cells can be treated by surgery or radiation therapy , .', 'However,
    these treatment options are available only after the diagnoses of brain tumors,
    whereas in many cases these metastasized tumors remain undiagnosed for long time.',
  'Considering the fact that breast tumors cells may remain dormant or grow as micro-tumors
    that are undetectable for long time, it is necessary to develop modalities to
    suppress the growth of metastasized tumors.', The present study suggests the potential
    of PEITC in suppressing the growth of tumors in brain., "We observed about 50\u201355%
    suppression of tumor burden in brains of mice treated with PEITC after intra-cardiac
    injection of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells.", 'In addition, PEITC also suppressed
    the growth of few non-specific metastatic tumors in this model.', This provides
    a direct evidence of the in vivo cytotoxic effects of PEITC on the growth of breast
    tumor cells at various metastatic sites in mice including brain., Clinical testing
    for the presence of HER2 status has become a standard practice after the diagnosis
    of breast cancer., 'This can be explained by the increasing evidence for the role
    of HER2 in breast cancer progression and metastasis , , .', Palmieri et al., have
    shown a direct role of HER2 overexpression with that of increased metastatic outgrowth
    of breast cancer cells in brain ., Our recent studies demonstrated that PEITC
    can suppress the growth of breast tumor cells in vitro and in vivo by targeting
    HER2 ., 'In the present study, the immunofluorescence data showed significantly
    reduced staining of HER2 in the brain of mice treated with PEITC.', It is possible
    that PEITC suppresses brain metastasis due to HER2 inhibition in mice brain.,
  Our data provides a new direction for exploring the possible role of brain HER2
    in providing a suitable microenvironment to breast cancer cells., "The role of
    vascular endothelial growth factor in breast cancer metastasis has been already
    established in several studies , \u2013.", We observed reduced expression of VEGF
    in the brains of mice treated with PEITC., 'These results suggest that PEITC elicits
    anti-metastatic effects possibly by suppressing VEGF levels, consistent with observation
    made earlier by other groups , .', "Epidermal growth factor receptor has been
    long associated with metastasis \u2013.", "Suppression of EGFR by 10 \xB5M PEITC
    has been shown in prostate cancer cells by Kim et al .", 'In agreement with these
    studies, our studies also indicate EGFR suppression in the brains of mice treated
    with PEITC.', 'Taken together, these observations suggest that suppression of
    breast cancer metastasis to brain by PEITC could be associated with inhibition
    of HER2, EGFR and VEGF.', 'However, detailed studies are required to mechanistically
    establish this correlation.', "The prognosis of breast cancer patients with brain
    metastasis is generally poor and the survival of the patients ranges from 3\u20135
    months \u2013.", Our data shows that PEITC enhanced the median survival of mice
    by almost 21% that had metastasized breast tumors., PEITC has been reported to
    have high oral bioavailability., "The oral bioavailability of PEITC in rats was
    found to be 115 and 93% with doses of 10 \xB5mol/kg and 100 \xB5mol/kg respectively
    .", 'Based on these studies, it appears that the concentrations of PEITC used
    in our experiments can be achieved by oral administration.', Conaway et al., "achieved
    the concentration of about 2.07pmol/mg of PEITC in the brain tissue by gavaging
    10 \xB5mol/kg PEITC in each mouse .", This observation indicated that PEITC can
    reach brain in substantial amounts indicating its availability in brain tissue.,
  'It is conceivable that the growth suppression of metastatic tumors in the brain
    of mice treated with PEITC could be due to the fact that PEITC can reach brain
    through systemic circulation, cross blood brain barrier and elicit anti-tumor
    effects.', We recently demonstrated the anti-proliferative effects of PEITC in
    breast cancer cells and that the effect of PEITC was more pronounced in HER2 positive
    breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo ., 'Our current study presents a novel
    role of PEITC in preventing and suppressing breast cancer metastasis in vivo possibly
    by suppressing HER2, EGFR and VEGF, which are known to promote cell motility.',
  'Taken together, the results from our study indicate that PEITC suppresses brain
    metastasis of breast cancer cells.', Kind gift of MDA-MB-231 cells and HER2 overexpressing
    MDA-MB-231 cells by Dr. Patricia S. Steeg and Dr. Quentin Smith are greatly appreciated.,
