["The conversion of the plant-derived omega-3 \xCE\xB1-linolenic acid to the long-chain
    eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid can be increased by ALA sufficient
    diets compared to ALA deficient diets.", Diets containing ALA above an optimal
    level result in no further increase in DHA levels in animals and humans., The
    present study evaluates means of maximizing plasma DHA accumulation by systematically
    varying both linoleic acid and ALA dietary level., Weanling rats were fed one
    of 54 diets for three weeks., The diets varied in the percentage of energy of
    LA and ALA by manipulating both the fat content and the balance of vegetable oils.,
  The peak of plasma phospholipid DHA was attained as a result of feeding a narrow
    dietary range of 1-3 en% ALA and 1-2 en% LA but was suppressed to basal levels
    at dietary intakes of total polyunsaturated fatty acids above 3 en%., We conclude
    it is possible to enhance the DHA status of rats fed diets containing ALA as the
    only source of n-3 fatty acids but only when the level of dietary PUFA is low.]
