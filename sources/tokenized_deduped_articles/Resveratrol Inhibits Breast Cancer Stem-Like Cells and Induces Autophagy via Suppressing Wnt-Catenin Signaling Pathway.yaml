['Resveratrol, a natural polyphenolic compound, is abundantly found in plant foods
    and has been extensively studied for its anti-cancer properties.', 'Given the
    important role of CSCs in breast tumorigenesis and progression, it is worth investigating
    the effects of resveratrol on CSCs.', The article is an attempt to investigate
    the effects of resveratrol on breast CSCs., 'Resveratrol significantly inhibits
    the proliferation of BCSCs isolated from MCF-7 and SUM159, and decreased the percentage
    of BCSCs population, consequently reduced the size and number of mammospheres
    in non-adherent spherical clusters.', 'Accordingly, the injection of resveratrol
    in NOD/SCID mice effectively inhibited the growth of xenograft tumors and reduced
    BCSC population in tumor cells.', 'After the reimplantation of primary tumor cells
    into the secondary mice for 30 d, all 6 control inoculations produced tumors,
    while tumor cells derived from resveratrol-treated mice only caused 1 tumor of
    6 inoculations.', 'Further studies by TEM analysis, GFP-LC3-II puncta formation
    assay and western blot for LC3-II, Beclin1 and Atg 7, showed that resveratrol
    induces autophagy in BCSCs.', "Moreover, resveratrol suppresses Wnt/\u03B2-catenin
    signaling pathway in BCSCs; over-expression of \u03B2-catenin by transfecting
    the plasmid markedly reduced resveratrol-induced cytotoxicity and autophagy in

    the molecular mechanisms involved in their origin, self-renewal, differentiation
    into cancer cells, resistance to radiation therapy and chemotherapy, and invasiveness
    and metastatic ability .', Clinical analyses of CSCs in breast tumors have found
    a correlation between the proportion of CSCs and poor prognosis ., 'Therefore,
    chemoprevention and therapy strategies that specifically target CSCs are an urgent
    need .', 'Because a diet rich in plant foods reduced the risks of cancer, there

    capacity to drive tumor initiation, resistance and relapse/recurrence.', 'Current
    chemopreventions and chemotherapies are not efficacious in the treatment of advanced
    and metastatic disease, so novel approaches are required to specifically target
    CSC populations.', 'Thus, therapies that are directed against both differentiated
    cancer cells and CSCs may improve the treatment of these diseases.', 'Studies

    against breast CSCs.', 'Our findings showed that resveratrol could significantly
    inhibit breast CSCs in vitro and in vivo, effectively reducing breast CSCs population,
