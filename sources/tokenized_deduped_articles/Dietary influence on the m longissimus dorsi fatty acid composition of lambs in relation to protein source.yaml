['Dietary lipid effect, as a consequence of protein supplement, on lamb m. longissimus
    dorsi fatty acid composition was investigated, with emphasis on biohydrogenation
    intermediates.', 'Crossbred lambs were fed a barley-based diet without or with
    protein supplements including peas, rapeseed cake or hempseed cake.', 'The HC
    diet resulted in the highest muscle 22:6n-3 proportion, with the RC diet being
    similar.', 'Protein supplement did not affect the c9,t11 conjugated linoleic acid
    proportion, however the HC diet increased some minor CLA isomers, including t10,c12
    CLA.', 'The t10-18:1 and total trans-18:1 were lowest for the RC diet, likely
    relating to rumen conditions and precursor availability.', 'The saturated, monounsaturated
    and branched-chain fatty acids were largely unaffected by protein supplement.',
  'In conclusion, feeding the RC diet lowered the t10-18:1 and total trans-18:1 in
    meat, and modestly increased 22:6n-3 content.', 'The direction of these changes
    would be beneficial, making the RC diet the preferred protein supplement; however
    the magnitude of the changes in the present experiment may not be sufficient to
    have an impact on human health.']
