['Carnosic acid is a widely employed antioxidant and the main active component in
    rosemary and sage, but its metabolism remains largely unknown.', 'The present
    study investigated the metabolism of CA in vitro and in vivo for the first time,
    using high performance liquid chromatography coupled with hybrid triple quadrupole-linear
    ion trap mass spectrometry.', 'A couple of scan modes were adopted in mass spectrometer
    domain, including Q1 full scan, neutral loss scan-information dependent acquisition-enhanced
    product ion and precursor ion scan-information dependent acquisition-enhanced
    product ion.', 'In particular, a prediction was carried out on the basis of in
    vitro metabolism results, and gave birth to a multiple ion monitoring-information
    dependent acquisition-enhanced product ion mode aiming to detect the trace metabolites
    in CA-treated biological samples.', 'A total of ten metabolites, along with three
    degradative products, were identified for CA from in vitro metabolism models,
    including liver microsomes of human and rats, human intestinal microsomes and
    two species of Cunninghamella elegans.', 'Twelve and six metabolites were detected
    from CA-treated urine and feces, respectively.', 'In addition, five metabolites
    in vivo were purified and definitely identified using NMR spectroscopy.', 'The
    results of both in vitro and in vivo metabolism studies indicated poor metabolic
    stability for CA, and the glucuronidation and oxidation metabolisms extensively
    occurred for CA in vitro, while oxidation, glucuronidation and methylation were
    the main metabolic pathways observed in vivo.']
