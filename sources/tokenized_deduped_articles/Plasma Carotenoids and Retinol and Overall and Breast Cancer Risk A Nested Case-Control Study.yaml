['Experimental studies suggest that carotenoids and retinol may play a role in carcinogenesis,
    but epidemiological evidence is lacking.', 'We investigated the prospective associations
    between plasma concentrations of major carotenoids and retinol, and overall and
    breast cancer risk.', A nested case-control study included all first incident
    cancer cases diagnosed in the SU.VI.MAX cohort between 1994 and 2002., Baseline
    plasma concentrations of carotenoids and retinol were measured by high-performance
    liquid chromatography., "Conditional logistic regression was used to assess odds
    ratios for an increase of 0.1 \u03BCmol/L  and 95% confidence intervals.", "Plasma
    \u03B2-carotene and \u03B2-cryptoxanthin concentrations were inversely associated
    with overall cancer risk.", "Plasma \u03B2-cryptoxanthin concentration was inversely
    associated with breast cancer risk.", 'The OR between plasma lycopene concentration
    and overall cancer risk was 1.07, Ptrend = 0.06.', This association turned significant
    when excluding cancer cases diagnosed during the first year of follow-up., "This
    prospective study suggests an inverse association between plasma concentrations
    of \u03B2-cryptoxanthin and both overall and breast cancer risk, and an inverse
    association between \u03B2-carotene and overall cancer risk.", The direct association
    between lycopene concentration and cancer risk deserves further investigation.]
