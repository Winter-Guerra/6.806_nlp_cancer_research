['Cruciferous vegetables are a major source of glucosinolate-derived bioactive compounds
    such as isothiocyanates, which have been shown in animal and in vitro studies
    to inhibit cancer growth and progression.', Few studies have investigated cruciferous
    vegetable intake after diagnosis and breast cancer outcomes., 'Using data from
    the After Breast Cancer Pooling Project, which includes prospective data from
    U.S. and Chinese breast cancer survivors, we evaluated the association of cruciferous
    vegetables with breast cancer outcomes.', "Analyses included 11,390 women diagnosed
    with stage I\u2013III invasive breast cancer from four cohorts.", Cruciferous
    vegetable intake was assessed using food frequency questionnaires., Study heterogeneity
    was evaluated by the Q statistic; hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals were
    estimated using delayed-entry Cox regression models stratified by study., 'After
    a median follow-up of 9.0 years, 1,725 deaths and 1,421 recurrences were documented.',
  'In pooled analyses using study-specific quartiles, cruciferous vegetable intake
    was not associated with breast cancer outcomes, adjusting for known clinical prognostic
    factors and selected lifestyle factors.', 'HRs by increasing quartiles were 1.08,
    1.01, and 1.10 for recurrence and 1.01, 0.97, and 0.99 for total mortality.',
  'No associations were observed for subgroups defined by estrogen receptor status,
    stage, or tamoxifen therapy.', Cruciferous vegetable intake at approximately two
    years after diagnosis was not associated with recurrence or mortality., Our results
    do not support an association between postdiagnosis cruciferous vegetable intake
    and breast cancer outcomes., "Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev; 22(8); 1451\u20136.",
