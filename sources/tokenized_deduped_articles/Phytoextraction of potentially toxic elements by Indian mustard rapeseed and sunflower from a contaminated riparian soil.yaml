['The objective of this study was to quantify the phytoextraction of the potentially
    toxic elements Al, As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Mo, Ni, Pb, Se, V, and Zn by Indian mustard,
    rapeseed, and sunflower from a contaminated riparian soil.', 'To achieve this
    goal, a greenhouse pot experiment was established using a highly contaminated
    grassland soil collected at the Wupper River.', 'The impact of ethylene-diamine-tetra-acetic
    acid, humate, and phosphate potassium on the mobility and uptake of the elements
    by rapeseed also was investigated.', 'Indian mustard showed the highest efficiency
    for phytoextraction of Al, Cr, Mo, Se, and V; sunflower for Cd, Ni, Pb, and Zn,
    and rapeseed for Cu.', 'The bioconcentration ratios were higher than 1 for the
    elements, indicating the suitability of the studied plants for phytoextraction.',
  'Application of EDTA to the soil increased significantly the solubility of Cd, Co,
    Cr, Ni, and Pb and decreased the solubility of Al, As, Se, V, and Mo.', 'Humate
    potassium decreased significantly the concentrations of Al and As in rapeseed
    but increased the concentrations of Cu, Se, and Zn.', 'We may conclude that HK
    can be used for immobilization of Al and As, while it can be used for enhancing
    the phytoextraction of Cu, Se, and Zn by rapeseed.', 'Phosphate potassium immobilized

    soil Oil-producing crops\n\n\n\nHigh concentrations of potentially toxic elements
    in soils and sediments may cause long-term risks to humans and ecosystems.", Many
    riparian and wetland soils worldwide and in Germany are highly contaminated with
    PTEs., 'Due to the high concentrations of PTEs in riparian soils, these elements
    might be released and mobilized, leading to soil and groundwater contamination
    what increase the possibility of entering into the grassland and food chain.',
  'Thus, remediation of soils contaminated with PTEs has received increasing attention
    and is doubtless an important issue for an adequate environmental management.',
  'Phytoremediation of soils contaminated with PTEs is a natural, environmental friendly,
    and a cost-effective technology based on the use of specially selected element-accumulating
    plants to remove these elements from soils and waters.', Phytoextraction is a
    subprocess of phytoremediation in which plants remove toxic elements from soil.,
  'Recently, using oil-producing crops for phytoremediation of PTE-contaminated soils
    is recommended because they are not for direct food consumption, and thus, bioaccessibility
    is hampered.', 'Indian mustard, rapeseed, and sunflower are traditional crops
    which can be used for the production of oil and also used in phytoremediation
    of soils polluted with PTEs.', Nowadays many farmers tend to focus a part of their
    production on technical crops and/or the utilization of classical crops as main
    products or byproducts for industrial as well as energy purposes., 'As for the
    biomass energy generation, oil crops are primarily used as a substitute for diesel
    engine fuels thanks to the high-energy content in their oils.', 'Thus, cultivation
    of bioenergy crops, i.e., rapeseed, Indian mustard, and sunflower, in the contaminated
    soils has the potential to become a profitable enterprise when combined with biofuel
    production, especially in view of the increasing oil prices over the coming years.',
  'Additionally, since phytoextraction is a long-term technology, fields undergoing
    phytoremediation need to be kept productive to achieve economically viable and
    socially acceptable decontamination.', 'Moreover, the use of energy and/or biodiesel
    crops as PTEs phytoextraction plants would give contaminated soils a productive
    value and decrease remediation costs.', 'Very little is known on PTE tolerance
    and accumulation of oil-producing crops such as Indian mustard, rapeseed, and
    sunflower growing in polluted riparian grassland soils.', 'In addition, those
    plant species have not been investigated for this purpose in contaminated riparian
    soils.', 'Moreover, no attempts have been made to study the effectiveness of some
    applicable materials, i.e., humate potassium, phosphate potassium, and the ethylene-diamine-tetra-acetic
    acid, for the mobilization/immobilization of PTEs in heavily contaminated riparian
    soils.', 'Therefore, the novelty of the current study is that we examine a variety
    of crops not tested as accumulators for PTEs in this soil and not restricted in
    a particular geographical locality.', 'Additionally, the use of plants, which
    are not for direct food consumption and of high economic value, e.g., bioenergy
    crops such as rapeseed, Indian mustard, and sunflower, as test crops in toxic
    metal-contaminated soils, is an issue worth evaluating.', 'We hypothesized that
    the oil-producing and non-edible plants such as rapeseed, Indian mustard, and
    sunflower might be a possible trial for phytoremediation of these contaminated
    riparian sites.', 'In addition, application of humate potassium and phosphate
    potassium might enhance the phytoextraction of PTEs by these plants.', 'Therefore,
    the objectives of our study were to examine the efficiency of Indian mustard,
    rapeseed, and sunflower for phytoextraction of Al, As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Mo, Ni,
    Pb, Se, V, and Zn from a highly contaminated riparian soil and to assess the impact
    of EDTA, humate potassium, and phosphate potassium on the phytoextraction of the
    elements by rapeseed.', 'The study site is located at the lower course of the
    Wupper River close to the confluence into the Rhine River, near the town Leverkusen,
    about 20 km to the north of Cologne, Germany.', The site is used as grassland.,
  'The study site is flooded periodically by the Wupper River, usually in springtime.',
  The soil is classified as Eutric Fluvisols according to IUSS-FAO., The industrialization
    started very early in the Wupper River catchment and was intense during the last
    centuries., 'The main sources are discharges from metal, textile, and chemical
    industry during the last centuries.', 'Particularly knife manufacturing, electroplating,
    and textile bleaching occurred frequently in this catchment.', 'Thus, high concentrations
    of PTEs, particularly Cu, occur in soils of this area.', 'Soil profile was excavated,
    described in detail and investigated.', The particular soil horizon was selected
    for this study since it reveals the highest contamination of Cu., About 400 kg
    soil was collected from an area 4 m2., The sampling was performed in eight replicates
    of about 50 kg which were pooled to one composite sample., 'Soil material was
    homogenized, air-dried, and crushed handily.', Soil properties and oxides content
    were determined according to standard methods., Total concentrations of the elements
    in the soil were extracted after its digestion in a microwave system., The available
    form from the studied elements was extracted by 1 M ammonium bicarbonate and 0.005
    M diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid according to Soltanpour and Schwab., Chemical
    fractions of the elements were sequentially extracted based on the work of Tessier
    et al., "and proposed by S\xE1nchez-Mart\xEDn et al..", "The method used discriminates
    the elements into soluble + exchangeable, sorbed and bound to carbonate, Fe\u2013Mn
    oxide bound2C2O4 and 0.1 M H2C2O4), and organically bound.", Separation between
    steps was by decantation of the supernatant after centrifugation at 5000 rpm for
    20 min., 'The concentrations of Al, As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Mo, Ni, Pb, Se, V, and
    Zn in the digested and extracted soil samples were measured by inductively coupled
    plasma-optical emission spectroscopy.', A 4-point calibration was performed with
    standard solutions diluted in deionised water., Each sample was measured in three
    replications., The relative standard deviation of replicate analysis was below
    5 %., The concentrations were calculated on the basis of dry weight of samples.,
  'The efficiency of Indian mustard, rapeseed, and sunflower to phytoextract Al, As,
    Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Mo, Ni, Pb, Se, V, and Zn from the studied soil was quantified
    in a greenhouse pot experiment.', A portion of 4 kg air-dried soil was placed
    into 25-cm-diameter and 30-cm-height pots., 'The influence of EDTA, HK, and PK
    on the phytoavailability of the elements to the rapeseed was investigated by mixing
    of these materials with the soil 1 week before cultivation.', The commercial HK
    was used in this study., 'It is potassium salt of humic acid, is manufactured
    commercially by alkaline extraction of lignite or peat, and is used as a soil
    conditioner.', The HK is an alkaline and contain 10 % K2O., The HK2PO4 and EDTA
    were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich., 'A complete randomized block design was composed
    of three treatments, i.e., HK, PK, and EDTA as well as the control with three
    replicates each.', The pots were irrigated with approximately 1 L deionized water
    to reach a moisture content of about 60 % of the field capacity and incubated
    for 1 week., 'Indian mustard, rapeseed, and sunflower were planted.', Thirty seeds
    of rapeseed and Indian mustard and fifteen seeds of sunflower were sown in each
    pot., 'During the germination period, soil moisture was maintained at 80 % of
    field capacity and after thinning was raised to field capacity.', The pots were
    irrigated with deionized water., The moisture content was kept at field capacity
    by weighting the pots daily and adding the lost water., "The pots were irrigated
    with 300 ml from a nutrient solution that contains 0.8 g NH4NO3 L\u22121 and 0.4
    g HK2PO4 L\u22121 after 2 and 5 weeks from the germination.", The plants were
    harvested 12 weeks after seeding., The above-ground portion of plants was harvested.,
  "The harvested plants were thoroughly washed with 1 mM HCl, rinsed in distilled
    water, and dried to constant weight at 70 \xB0C in a forced draft oven.", 'The
    dry biomass of plants was recorded, and then the plant samples were grounded to
    fine powder in a stainless grinder and stored in plastic bags until analysis.',
  "One gram of plant material was dry-ashed in a muffle furnace at 450 \xB0C for 5
    h, extracted with 20 % hydrochloric acid.", 'The soil samples were taken out of
    the pots, air-dried, passed through a 2-mm sieve, and analyzed for pH and for
    available elements using AB-DTPA.', "Concentrations of the elements in plant and
    soil samples were measured by ICP\u2013OES.", 'In all measurements, blanks, triplicate
    measurements of PTEs in extracts, and analyses of certified reference materials
    for each element were routinely included for quality control.', Quality control
    of the extraction efficiency for the total element concentrations was performed
    using certified soil reference materials obtained from the Federal Institute for
    Materials Research and Testing., The average recovery ranged from 85 to 104.5
    % depending on the element., Maximum allowable relative standard deviation between
    replicates was set to 5 % for soil and 10 % for plant analyses., "The detection

    of variance and Duncan\u2019s multiple range tests to compare the means of the
    treatments at a level of significance of p ; 0.05 using the SPSS 22 package.",
  Basic properties of the soil are presented in Table 1., The soil texture was dominated
    by silt., 'The soil was weakly acidic, contained high organic carbon, and showed
    a moderate cation exchange capacity.', The concentrations of Fe oxides in the
    soil were higher than those of Mn oxides., The amorphous Fe and Mn values were
    relatively low compared with the crystalline form suggesting that the majority
    of Fe and Mn existed in crystalline form., 'Consequently, the acidity, high organic
    carbon content, and the oxide forms were expected to affect the element mobility
    and their phytoavailability to the plants.', 'Fe t and Mn t total Fe and Mn, Fe

    Concentrations of total, available, and fractions of the elements in the soil
    are presented in Table 2.', 'Concentrations of total As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb,
    Se, and Zn exceeded the precautionary values of the German Federal Soil Protection
    and Contaminated Sites Ordinance.', 'In addition, the values of As and Cu exceeded
    the action values.', 'The risk of Cu pollution in this riverine soil needs great
    concern because Cu can become mobilized at high concentrations leading to soil
    and groundwater contamination, which increases the possibility of Cu entering
    the food chain via vegetation.', High Cu concentrations can pose very high eco-toxicological
    and environmental risks and have significant agricultural relevance., 'Therefore,
    the German authorities must act per law to remediate these soils.', 'Moreover,
    the values of As, Cr, Cu, Pb, Se, and Zn were higher than the upper limit of the
    trigger action values for PTEs in agricultural soils as reported by Kabata-Pendias,
    implying harmful soil alterations which need soil remediation.', 'The element
    availability as extracted using AB-DTPA was high for Cd, Cu, Ni, and Zn.', Higher
    total concentrations of the elements in the studied soil are very likely due to

    Aluminum showed the highest BCR values followed by Mo, Co, Se, Zn, Cr, Pb, V,
    Ni, Cd, As, and Cu.', These results indicate that the BCR values differed widely
    among the elements and the plants and decreased with increasing AB-DTPA-extractable
    element., 'Copper showed the highest AB-DTPA-extractable concentrations and the
    lowest BCR values, indicating that the BCR values depend on available element
    concentration.', This was probably due to the fact that the increases in Cu concentration
    in plants with high available Cu in the soil were disproportionally lower than
    AB-DTPA increases caused by high Cu concentrations in the soil., 'Contrasting
    to Cu, although concentrations of AB-DTPA-extractable Al were very low as compared
    to the other elements, their concentrations in plant and BCR values were higher
    than the other elements, which might mean that a significant part of the non-residual
    fractions is mobile and might be available to plants.', 'The process of phytoextraction
    generally requires the translocation of elements to easily harvestable plant parts,
    i.e., shoots.', "Tolerant plants tend to restrict soil\u2013root and root\u2013shoot
    transfers and therefore have much less accumulation in their biomass, while hyperaccumulators
    actively take up and translocate elements into their aboveground biomass.", Plants
    exhibiting BCR values less than 1 are considered to be unsuitable for phytoextraction.,
  'Thus, the three studied plant species were capable of accumulating the elements
    in the above-ground biomass, and most of them had high BCR values, which means
    a high ability of element accumulation by the plants.', 'Thus, based on the BCR
    values, the studied plants were efficient in taking up the studied elements.',
  'In addition, based on the results of BCR, we may recommend Indian mustard for phytoremediation
    of soils contaminated with Al, As, Co, Cr, Mo, Se, and V, while sunflower is recommended
    for soils contaminated with Cd, Ni, Pb, and Zn, and rapeseed seems to be more
    suitable for Cu-contaminated soils.', 'Although the soil was never flooded during
    the pot experiment and, thus, very low redox potentials have obviously not occurred,
    however, it is known that low E h occur at field conditions at the riparian soil
    under study.', 'Therefore, E h are also considered to affect solubility of elements
    in this particular soil under field conditions.', 'Prevailing oxidizing conditions
    might facilitate the mobility of many elements in flooded soils, which may be
    attributed to dissolution of sulfides and the resulted release of elements.',
  'In opposite, several elements such as antimony, arsenic, chromium, and vanadium
    are known to be mobile under anoxic conditions.', 'Recently, Rinklebe et al.',
  reported that the pattern of E h/pH and the release mechanisms of trace elements
    in this highly contaminated soil and in the same soil treated with biochar-based
    material are basically similar which is an important finding also with view to
    a sustainable management of these ecosystems., 'Mixing the soil with EDTA, HK,
    and PK changed significantly concentrations of AB-DTPA-extractable elements as
    compared to the non-treated soil.', 'The EDTA increased significantly the concentrations
    of AB-DTPA extractable Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn, while it decreased significantly
    the concentrations of Al, As, Mo, Se, and V compared with the RS.', 'Therefore,
    application of EDTA inhibited the seed germination by 100 % because of the severe
    increasing of solubility of many toxic element especially Pb.', 'The addition
    of chelating agents and the consequent formation of element-chelate complexes
    prevent precipitation and sorption of the elements in the soil, thereby maintaining
    their availability for plant uptake.', The addition of chelates to the soil can
    also bring elements into solution through desorption of sorbed species and dissolution
    of precipitated compounds., 'The EDTA increased solubility of Pb, Zn, and Cd and
    therefore might be used for enhancement of the phytoextraction of these elements
    by the plants.', 'Despite the possible usefulness of this technology, some concerns
    have been expressed regarding the potential inherent risk of leaching of elements
    to groundwater.', The addition of chelates to PTE-contaminated matrix can increase
    the levels of water-extractable elements., 'For example, the application of EDTA
    to PTE-contaminated soil has been reported to increase significantly the concentrations
    of Cd, Zn, and Pb in soil solution which could pose an environmental risk as groundwater
    contamination.', 'The results of EDTA treatment conclude that application of synthetic
    chelating agents such as EDTA to heavily metal-contaminated soil like in our soil
    increase the availability of some elements such as Pb, Co, Zn, Ni, Cr, and Cd,
    decrease the availability of some other elements, i.e., Al, As, Se, V, and Mo,
    and thus might be useful for immobilization of these elements.', Application of
    HK improved dry biomass production compared with the non-amended soil., 'Additionally,
    the HK treatment changed significantly concentrations of the elements in the rapeseed
    as compared to the non-amended soil.', 'Humate potassium decreased significantly
    the concentrations of Al and As, while increased the concentrations of Cu, Se,
    and Zn, in rapeseed as compared to RS.', 'Nonsignificant differences of concentrations
    of Cd, Co, Cr, Mo, Ni, Pb, and V in rapeseed between the RS and RS + HK treatments
    were recorded.', These results suggest that the HK might be used as an immobilizing
    agent for Al and As in the soil., 'However, the HK might be used for enhancing
    phytoextraction of Cu, Se, and Zn from the soil by rapeseed.', Element immobilization
    by HK might be explained by its high alkalinity which increased soil pH and thus
    might increase element sorption and decrease element solubility and phytoavailability.,
  'Additionally, the high content of exchangeable functional groups in HK can absorb
    elements and decrease their solubility.', 'The impact of HK on element solubility
    differs based on soil pH, organic structure, and active groups as well as the
    molecular weight of organo-element complexes.', 'Due to a great affinity of soil
    PTEs like Cu for organic complexing, soluble element-organic forms appear to comprise
    most of the element solution.', Wu et al., reported that Cu humate complexes are
    mobile in both acidic and alkaline conditions., The net effect of humate is to
    increase cupric ion mobility especially under alkaline conditions., 'Additionally,
    we hypothesized that the increased uptake of Cu, Se, and Zn with the HK might
    be due to the dissolution of precipitated form that originates by the alkaline
    HK in the rhizosphere zone and release of these elements to soil solution and
    thus being available for plants.', 'In particular, HK increased significantly
    the biomass yield compared with the control, which enhance the phytoextraction
    of these elements by these high biomass roots.', These changes can be explained
    by the interaction of root exudates with the surrounding solids in the rhizosphere.,
  'As well, the HK might lead to an intense microbiological and biochemical activity
    in the rhizosphere which enables roots to mobilize certain precipitated elements
    by acidification and redox changes.', This may increase the soluble fraction and
    decrease the sorbed and carbonate fraction of these elements in the rhizosphere.,
  'Application of PK improved seed germination, plant growth, and dry biomass yield
    by about 60 %.', 'Additionally, the PK increased significantly the concentrations
    of As, Cr, Mo, and Se in rapeseed, while it decreased significantly concentrations
    of Al, Cd, Pb, and Zn as compared to rapeseed grown in the non-amended soil.',
  The role of phosphates in influencing the mobilization and bioavailability of As
    has been reported by Bolan et al., who found that addition of phosphate increased
    the mobility and bioavailability of As by 4.3-fold compared with the non-amended
    soil., 'Phosphate addition to soil influences uptake of As by plants through its
    effects on sorption, root absorption, and translocation from root to shoot.',
  'Additionally, uptake of As by plants is associated with the mechanism of uptake
    of P, where presumably As is taken up as a P analogue.', 'Therefore, there is
    a growing interest in using P fertilizer to enhance plant uptake of As in contaminated
    sites, aiming at facilitating phytoremediation.', 'The PK decreased significantly
    the plant tissue concentrations of Pb in RS + PK as compared to RS, which might
    mean that phosphates converted significant amounts of Pb from the mobile fractions
    to the residual fraction, and thus decreased the phytoavailability of Pb to rapeseed.',
  The role of phosphates in decreasing the mobilization and bioavailability of Pb
    has been reported previously., There are some reports that application of Cd-containing
    natural reactive phosphate rock can significantly increase the concentrations
    of Cd in the shoots of Zea mays., 'However, we found a high ability of phosphates
    in reducing Cd solubility.', 'In this respect, Bolan et al.', reported that the
    application of phosphate is effective in reducing Cd in contaminated soils., 'Thus,
    decreasing the plant tissue concentration of Cd and Pb in the PR-treated soil
    compared with the control suggested that PK amendment could significantly immobilize
    Cd and reduce their mobilization and phytoavailability in contaminated soils.',
  'There is conclusive evidence for the mitigated value of both water-soluble and
    water-insoluble phosphates to immobilize several metals in soils, thereby reducing
    their bioavailability for plant uptake.', 'In addition, reducing the uptake of
    Al, Cd, Pb, and Zn in PK treatment might be due to the antagonistic interaction
    between P and three elements.', 'In general, phosphate reduced the metal mobility
    and used for immobilization of metals in soils through various processes, including
    direct metal adsorption, antagonistic interactions, phosphate anion-induced metal
    adsorption, and precipitation of metals with solution phosphate as metal phosphates.',
  'Concentrations of toxic elements in the soil exceeded the precautionary value of
    Cd, Cr, Ni, Pb, and Zn and the action values of As and Cu set by the German Federal
    Soil Protection and Contaminated Sites Ordinance as well as the maximum allowable
    soil concentrations and the trigger action values for PTEs in agricultural soils
    as reported by Kabata-Pendias.', 'Therefore, assessing the phytoextraction of
    Al, As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Mo, Ni, Pb, Se, V, and Zn from this soil by non-edible
    plants was an approach worth to be investigated.', 'The plants revealed high BCR,
    which indicates the high efficiency of these plants for phytoextraction of the
    elements from the soil.', 'We may conclude that Indian mustard can be recommended
    for phytoremediation of soils contaminated by Al, As, Co, Cr, Mo, Se, and V, while
    sunflower may be recommended for soils contaminated by Cd, Ni, Pb, and Zn, and
    rapeseed seems to be more suitable for Cu-contaminated soils.', 'Thus, a combination
    of these three plants on such multi-element contaminated soils might be an option
    for future.', The results additionally indicate that application of synthetic
    chelating agents like EDTA to soils with high metal concentrations like our soil
    might increase the solubility of elements to toxic levels for seed germination
    and plant growth., Application of HK and PK improved the plant growth compared
    with control., 'The HK might be used as an immobilizing agent for Al and As, while
    PK might be recommended as an immobilizing agent for Al, Cd, Pb, and Zn.', 'On
    the other hand, HK showed high efficiency in enhancement of the phytoextraction
    of Cu, Se, and Zn, while PK is recommended for enhancement of the phytoextraction
    of As, Cr, Mo, and Se from the soil by rapeseed.', The results suggest that element-tolerant
    plant species with high BCR in combination with application of HK and PK can be
    considered to use for remediation and phytostabilization of toxic elements in
