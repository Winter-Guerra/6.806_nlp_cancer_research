["Shelf life of commercial cranberry syrup irradiated with gamma radiation at a rate
    of 5 kGy and stored for 6 months at 25 \xB0C and 60% relative humidity and under
    accelerated stability conditions was investigated.", High-performance liquid chromatography
    coupled to electrospray ionisation quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry
    was used to characterise cranberry syrup., 'Afterwards, these compounds were quantified
    by HPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS and 4-dimethylaminocinnamaldehyde assay.', A significant increase
    in the content of procyanidin B isomer 1 and procyanidin A2 was observed after
    irradiation and compared with the non-irradiated syrup., "Procyanidin B isomers
    and prodelphinidin were stable at 25 \xB0C during the first month of storage,
    whereas quercetin and some derivatives remained constant for 3 months of storage
    at this temperature.", "In short, after gamma-irradiation in dose of 5 kGy, most
    compounds were highly stable for a month at 25 \xB0C."]
