["Legumes are the base\xB4s diet in several countries.", 'They hold a high nutritional
    value, but other properties related to human health are nowadays being studied.',
  'The aim of this work was to study the influence of processes on the phenolic composition
    of dark beans and their effect on their antioxidant, neuroprotective and anticancer
    ability.', Phenolic composition of raw and processed dark beans was analysed by
    HPLC-PAD and HPLC-ESI/MS., The antioxidant activity was evaluated by ORAC., Astrocytes
    cultures have been used to test their neuroprotective effect., 'Anticancer activities
    were evaluated on three different cell lines, breast adenocarcinoma and melanoma)
    by sulphorhodamine B method.', 'Qualitative and quantitative differences in phenolic
    composition have been observed between raw and processed dark beans that influence
    the antioxidant activity, mainly for germinated samples which show a decrease
    of antioxidant capacity.', 'Although every assayed extracts decreased reactive
    oxygen species release and exhibited cytotoxicity activities on cancer cell lines,
    raw beans proved to be the most active in neuroprotective and antitumoral effects;
    this sample is especially rich in phenolic compounds, mainly anthocyanins.', 'This
    study further demonstrated that phenolic composition of dark beans is related
    with cooking process and so with their neuroprotective and anticancer activity;
    cooking of dark beans improves their digestion and absorption at intestinal level,
    while maintaining its protective ability on oxidative process at cellular level.']
