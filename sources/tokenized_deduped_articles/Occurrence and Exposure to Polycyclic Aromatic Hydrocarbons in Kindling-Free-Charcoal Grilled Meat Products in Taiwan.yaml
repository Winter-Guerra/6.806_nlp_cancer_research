['This study aimed to determine the contents of 16 PAHs in kindling-free-charcoal
    grilled meat and seafood products by GC-MS coupled with a QuEChERS method, and
    estimate the potential risk associated with consumption of those products in Taiwan.',
  "Results showed that the total PAHs contents ranged from 6.3 \xB1 0.9 to 238.8 \xB1
    8.3 ng/g in poultry meat, 0.1 \xB1 0.0-547.5 \xB1 12.2 ng/g in red meat, and 6.6
    \xB1 1.4-249.7 \xB1 6.4 ng/g in seafood products.", "Among various PAHs, the highly
    carcinogenic benzopyrene was detected in chicken breast grilled at 84 \xB0C, chicken
    heart at 100 \xB0C, chicken drumstick at 74 \xB0C, duck drumstick at 85 \xB0C,
    and lamb steak at 88 \xB0C, with its level amounting to 1.3 \xB1 0.0, 2.4 \xB1
    0.1, 4.0 \xB1 1.3, 3.1 \xB1 0.0, and 5.8 \xB1 0.5 ng/g, respectively.", 'The generation
    of PAHs was associated with grilling time, temperature and fat content.', "Risk
    assessment of dietary exposure to PAHs revealed toxicity equivalent to range from
    ND - 6.174 \xB1 0.505 \xCE\xBCg/g and margin of exposure was &gt;10,000, which
    agreed with the EFSAs definition of low public health concern.", 'The lifelong
    average daily PAHs intake was higher for adults than for elderly people in Taiwan,
    however, consumption of kindling-free-charcoal grilled meat should not be a public
    health concern based on cancer risk potency.']
