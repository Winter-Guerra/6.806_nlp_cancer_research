['Propolis, a natural product collected from plants by honey bees, is commonly used
    in folk medicines.', Endoplasmic reticulum stress is known to induce apoptosis
    through the induction of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein., 'Here,
    we investigated whether ethanol extracts of propolis and caffeic acid phenethyl
    ester induce apoptosis, mitochondrial dysfunction, and ER stress in human breast
    cancer MCF-7 cells and human fibroblasts.', 'Among several ethanol extracts of
    propolis and CAPE, Brazilian red propolis significantly reduced MCF-7 cell viability
    through the induction of mitochondrial dysfunction, caspase-3 activity, and DNA
    fragmentation but did not affect those of fibroblasts.', 'Moreover, treatment
    with BRP significantly induced CHOP expression in MCF-7 cells compared to fibroblasts.',
  'Further, pretreatment with a chemical chaperone, 4-phenylbutyric acid, suppressed
    BRP-triggered MCF-7 cell death.', 'Overall, we revealed that an ethanol extract
    of BRP induces MCF-7 cell apoptosis through, at least in part, ER stress-related
    signaling.', Propolis is a natural product made by honey bees from the gum of
    various plants., "Accumulated evidence using high-performance liquid chromatography
    and gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry has demonstrated that more than
    300 compounds, including flavonoids, amino acids, and fatty acids, are present
    in propolis.", '(1, 2) Propolis has been used in folk medicines and has been reported
    to have various biological properties, such as anticancer, antiviral, antioxidative,
    and antibacterial.', (3-6) It is well-recognized that the main components of propolis
    are due to the origin of plants., 'Indeed, it has been reported that Chinese propolis
    contains pinocembrin, chrysin, and caffeic acid phenethyl ester at high concentrations,
    but Brazilian propolis contains artepillin C and baccharin, instead of the above
    compounds.', '(7-10) Recently, red propolis samples were collected in northern
    regions of Brazil and classified as a new type of BP, and it has been reported
    that Brazilian red propolis contains daizein, biochanin A, quercetin, and naringenin.',
  '(11) Therefore, propolis-derived pharmacological activities vary according to the
    geographical and botanical origin.', "Recently, it has been reported that the
    ethanol extract of BRP promotes adipocyte differentiation through peroxisome proliferator-activated
    receptor-\u03B3 activation.", '(8)


    Among these several propolis compounds, artepillin C and CAPE are known to show
    antiproliferative and anticancer properties and to induce apoptosis.', '(6, 12)
    It is well-recognized that apoptosis is characterized by the activation of caspase
    signaling following mitochondrial dysfunction, such as increased pro-apoptotic
    protein Bax as well as decreased anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-xL and Bcl-2.', '(13-15)
    Moreover, anticancer properties are related to the activation of p53 and p38 mitogen-activated
    protein kinase and cell cycle arrest.', '(16) Recently, it has been recognized
    that endoplasmic reticulum stress is positively related to the exacerbation of
    several kinds of diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, retinopathy, and metabolic
    disorders, through the promotion of pro-apoptotic processes.', '(17, 18) ER stress-derived
    apoptosis is considered to be induced by the enhancement of CCAAT/enhancer-binding
    protein homologous protein.', "Although propolis extracts and CAPE, a main component
    of CP, are known to induce apoptosis in human breast cancer MCF-7 cells through
    the inhibition of nuclear factor-\u03BAB,(6) the involvement of mitochondrial
    dysfunction and ER stress-related signaling in the BRP-induced apoptosis remains
    unknown.", 'Ethanol extracts of CP , BRP, and BP, provided by Api Co., Ltd., were
    obtained by the addition of 3.5 volumes of 95% ethanol to 50 g of propolis at
    room temperature for 24 h and filtration.', There major constituents and amounts
    were previously determined by HPLC and shown in Table 1., "(8-11, 19)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuman

    10% FCS, 100 units/mL penicillin, and 100 \u03BCg/mL streptomycin.", "The cells
    were kept in an atmosphere of 5% CO2/95% air at 37 \xB0C.", 'The cells were grown
    to confluence in a 96-well microplate for measurement of cell viability or a 6
    cm culture dish for others and treated with the test reagents, including propolis
    ethanol extracts, CAPE, daidzein, and biochanin A. Pretreatment with 4-phenylbutyric
    acid and Z-VAD-FMK was added 1 h prior to the addition of the ethanol extract
    of propolis.', 'The cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline
    and then used for measurements of cell viability, determination of apoptosis,
    reverse transcriptional-polymerase chain reaction analysis, and western blotting.',
  'A 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay was used to
    estimate the cytotoxicity of ethanol extracts or constituents of propolis.', "After
    treatment of these cells with propolis, the culture medium was aspirated and the
    cells were added to 110 \u03BCL of 10% FCS\u2013DMEM containing MTT and were then
    incubated for 3 h at 37 \xB0C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2/95% air.",
  "After incubation, the cells were added to 100 \u03BCL isopropanol containing 0.04
    N HCl and were then mixed thoroughly to dissolve the MTT formazan.", 'Finally,
    the MTT formazen was measured at 595 nm with a reference wavelength of 655 nm.',
  'After treatment of MCF-7 cells and fibroblasts with ethanol extracts of propolis
    and CAPE, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and collected by centrifugation
    at 550g for 10 min.', The pellets were lysed on ice for 10 min in lysis buffer.,
  Caspase-3 activity was then assayed using an Apopcyto caspase-3 colorimetric assay
    kit according to the protocol of the manufacturer., 'After treatment of MCF-7
    cells and fibroblasts with ethanol extracts of propolis and CAPE, the cells were
    washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed on ice for 20 min in lysis buffer .',
  The lysates were centrifuged at 13000g for 10 min., "The supernatants were deprotenized

    once with an equal volume of phenol/chloroform/isoamylalcohol mixture, and then
    precipitated with 2.5 volumes of ethanol in the presence of 0.3 M sodium acetate.",
  "After centrifugation at 17700g for 10 min, the pellets were washed with 70% ethanol
    and resuspended in 20 \u03BCL of 10 mM Tris-HCl at pH 8.0 containing 1 mM EDTA
    and 10 \u03BCg/mL RNase.", "The DNA solution was incubated at 37 \xB0C for 1 h,
    and 5 \u03BCg DNA was separated on 1.5% agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide,
    and photographed.", 'The cDNA was prepared, and RT-PCR was performed by the methods
    described in our previous report.', (20) The primer sequences and PCR conditions
    used in this study were shown in Table 2., 'These PCR products were loaded onto
    a 2% agarose gel for electrophoresis, and densitometric analysis of the PCR products
    was performed with Multi Gauge, version 3.0.', Whole cell extracts were prepared
    in lysis buffer as described previously., "(21) Extracts containing 20 \u03BCg
    of protein were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate\u2013polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
    on 12% polyacrylamide gels followed by transferring electrophoretically onto polyvinylidene
    difluoride membranes.", 'Subsequently, the membranes were incubated with the respective
    specific primary antibodies.', 'The blots were incubated with biotin-conjugated
    goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibody, followed by incubation with ABC reagents.',
  'Finally, the bands were detected using SuperSignal West Pico and imaged using a
    LAS-3000 UV mini.', "Data are expressed as the means \xB1 standard deviation of
    three independent experiments.", 'Statistical evaluation of the data was performed
    using analysis of variation, followed by post-hoc Bonferroni tests.', A p value
    less than 0.05 was considered significant., 'Propolis, a natural product made
    by honey bees, is known to have several chemical components and to show biological
    properties, such as antiviral, antibacterial, antioxidative, and anticancer.',
  'We previously reported that ethanol extracts of CP, BRP, and BP show antioxidative
    property and suppress reactive-oxygen-species-derived cell death.', "(22) On the
    other hand, it has been reported that CAPE has anticancer properties by inhibiting
    NF-\u03BAB and activating caspase and Fas signaling in human breast cancer MCF-7
    cells;(6) however, whether an ethanol extract of BRP has anticancer properties
    remains unclear.", 'Accordingly, we first investigated the effect of ethanol extracts
    of CP, BRP, and BP and CAPE on the cell viability of human breast cancer MCF-7
    cells and human fibroblasts.', 'As shown in Figure 1A, ethanol extracts of CP
    and BRP and CAPE significantly decreased MCF-7 cell viability in a dose-dependent
    manner but an ethanol extract of BP did not affect MCF-7 cell viability.', 'On
    the other hand, these extracts did not induce cell death in fibroblasts, suggesting
    that ethanol extracts of propolis and CAPE induce cell death only in MCF-7 cells.',
  'Because it is well-recognized that the main components of propolis are due to the
    origin of plants,(23, 24) differences in the contained components were considered
    to be associated with differences in the induction of MCF-7 cell death.', Figure
    1., 'Effect of ethanol extracts of CP, BRP, and BP and CAPE on cell viability
    in MCF-7 cells and fibroblasts.', 'MCF-7 cells and fibroblasts were treated with
    the indicated concentrations of ethanol extracts of propolis and CAPE for 24 h.
    After treatment, cell viability was measured..', 'The activation of caspase-signaling
    pathways, such as caspase-3, caspase-6, caspase-8, and caspase-9, is known to
    be closely related to apoptotic processes.', '(25) Indeed, it has been reported
    that propolis-induced apoptosis in MCF-7 cells and human osteogenic carcinoma
    SAOS-2 cells is mediated by the induction of caspase signaling.', '(26, 27) In
    this study, treatment with ethanol extracts of CP and BRP significantly induced
    caspase-3 activities in MCF-7 cells compared to fibroblasts.', 'Moreover, especially
    in BRP-treated MCF-7 cells, DNA fragmentation was observed.', 'On the other hand,
    ethanol extracts of propolis and CAPE did not induce caspase-3 activities and
    DNA fragmentation in fibroblasts.', 'We next investigated the involvement of caspase
    signaling in ethanol extracts on BRP-induced apoptosis using Z-VAD-FMK, a pan-caspase
    inhibitor.', 'Pretreatment with Z-VAD-FMK significantly suppressed cell death
    and DNA fragmentation induced by an ethanol extract of BRP, suggesting that caspase
    signaling plays a pivotal role in apoptosis induced by an ethanol extract of BRP.',
  Figure 2., Ethanol extract of BRP induces apoptosis in MCF-7 cells but not in fibroblasts.,
  "MCF-7 cells and fibroblasts were treated with 20 \u03BCg/mL CP, BRP, and BP or
    2 \u03BCM CAPE for 24 h. After treatment, caspase-3 activities were measured and
    DNA fragmentation was determined.. MCF-7 cells were pretreated with or without
    10 \u03BCM Z-VAD-FMK for 1 h and then treated with or without 20 \u03BCg/mL BRP
    for 24 h. After treatment, cell viability was measured and DNA fragmentation was
    determined..\n\nMitochondrial dysfunction, such as increased pro-apoptotic protein
    Bax as well as decreased anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-xL and Bcl-2, is considered
    to be closely associated with the induction of apoptosis.", (13-15) We therefore
    investigated whether an ethanol extract of BRP led to changes in the expression
    of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins in MCF-7 cells and fibroblasts., 'As shown
    in Figure 3, the expression of Bax mRNA in MCF-7 cells was bell-shaped, whereas
    Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 mRNA in MCF-7 cells were decreased.', "Moreover, the reduction
    of Bcl-2 by 20 \u03BCg/mL BRP was determined as early as 12 h, reaching 21% by
    24 h; however, in fibroblasts, treatment with BRP did not affect these expressions,
    suggesting that the significant induction of Bax and reduction of Bcl-xL and Bcl-2
    might be involved in BRP-induced apoptosis.", Figure 3., Ethanol extract of BRP
    induces mitochondrial dysfunction in MCF-7 cells but not in fibroblasts., 'MCF-7
    cells and fibroblasts were treated with the indicated concentrations of an ethanol
    extract of BRP for 24 h. After treatment, Bax, Bcl-xL, and Bcl-2 mRNA were measured.',
  "RT-PCR data were normalized using \u03B2-actin levels..", It is well-known that
    ER stress contributes to the exacerbation of several diseases through the induction
    of apoptosis., '(17, 18) Under ER stress conditions, cells trigger a set of pathways
    known as the unfolded protein response, which is mediated by the upregulation
    of chaperones, such as glucose-regulated protein 78 kDa, GRP94, and oxygen-regulated
    protein 150 kDa.', '(28, 29) On the other hand, pro-apoptotic pathways are also
    activated and mediated by the induction of CHOP.', '(30, 31) It has been reported
    that propolis suppressed ER stress-induced cell death in neuronal cells,(32) suggesting
    the utility of propolis against ER stress-triggered disturbances of tissue and
    cell homeostasis; however, in this study, we observed that treatment with an ethanol
    extract of BRP significantly induced the expression of CHOP in MCF-7 cells compared
    to that in fibroblasts, suggesting that ER stress may be involved in BRP-induced
    apoptosis in MCF-7 cells.', 'Moreover, pretreatment with 4-phenylbutyric acid,
    an ER stress inhibitor,(33, 34) partially but significantly suppressed the ethanol
    extract of BRP-triggered cell death and induction of CHOP in MCF-7 cells.', These
    results indicate that ER stress plays a major role in the ethanol extract of BRP-triggered
    apoptosis., Figure 4., Involvement of ER stress in the ethanol extract of BRP-induced
    apoptosis in MCF-7 cells., "MCF-7 cells and fibroblasts were treated with the
    indicated concentrations of an ethanol extract of BRP for 24 h or 20 \u03BCg/mL
    BRP for the indicated hours.", 'After treatment, CHOP mRNA and protein levels
    were measured.', "RT-PCR data were normalized using \u03B2-actin levels.", "MCF-7
    cells were pretreated with the indicated concentrations of PBA or with or without
    2 mM PBA for 1 h and then treated with or without 20 \u03BCg/mL BRP for 24 h.
    After treatment, cell viability and CHOP mRNA were measured.", "RT-PCR data were
    normalized using \u03B2-actin levels.", 'MCF-7 cells were treated with the indicated
    concentrations of daidzein or biochanin A for 24 h. After treatment, cell viability
    and CHOP mRNA were measured.', "RT-PCR data were normalized using \u03B2-actin
    levels.", 'Next, we investigated the effect of daidzein and biochanin A on MCF-7
    cell apoptosis because these compounds are reported to be main constituents of
    the ethanol extract of BRP.', Treatment with daidzein and biochanin A significantly
    reduced cell viability., 'Moreover, we also determined the induction of CHOP when
    MCF-7 cells were treated with daidzein and biochanin A.', 'Recently, it has been
    reported that propolis activates estrogen-receptor-dependent signaling.', '(35)
    Therefore, we next investigated the involvement of estrogen receptor signaling
    in the viability of MCF-7 cells(36) in comparison to those of human prostate cancer
    LNCaP cells(37) and human breast cancer ZR-75-1 cells.', '(36) Treatment with
    ethanol extracts of propolis induced cell death in LNCaP cells, but not in ZR-75-1
    cells.', "These results suggested the possibility that ethanol extracts of propolis-induced
    cell death might depend upon estrogen receptor \u03B2-derived signaling.", 'However,
    additional studies will be necessary to determine the exact molecular mechanisms
    governing the relationship between estrogen receptor-derived signaling and MCF-7
    cell apoptosis.', Figure 5., 'Effect of ethanol extracts of CP, BRP, and BP on
    cell viability in LNCaP cells and ZR-75-1 cells.', 'These cells were treated with
    the indicated concentrations of ethanol extracts of propolis for 24 h. After treatment,
    cell viability was measured.', 'In this study, we investigated whether an ethanol
    extract of BRP induces MCF-7 cell apoptosis and first revealed that apoptosis
    was, at least in part, mediated by ER stress-related signaling.', 'Although these
    results were in contrast to previous reports that mentioned that propolis acts
    as an inhibitor of ER stress, a property that significantly induces ER stress
    only in cancer cells might contribute to the development of novel anticancer drugs.',
