[Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons represent an important pollutant in foods and/or
    the environment., 'This study aimed to determine the PAH contents in sugar-smoked
    meat by employing a quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, safe method combined
    with a GC-MS technique and assess the dietary exposure of PAHs in Taiwan.', 'Results
    showed that the longer the sugar-smoking duration, the more the total PAH formation.',
  'By sugar-smoking for 6 min, the total PAH contents generated in red meat were higher
    than in poultry meat and seafood, with lamb steak containing the largest amount
    of total PAHs.', 'Most importantly, the highly carcinogenic benzopyrene remained
    undetected in all of the sugar-smoked meat samples.', "In addition, the cancer
    risk due to dietary PAH exposure based on total intake of meat in Taiwan was ;2
    \xD7 10\u20137.", This outcome demonstrates that sugar-smoking can be adopted
    to replace the traditional smoking process with wood as smoke source., 'Polycyclic
    aromatic hydrocarbons are ubiquitous environmental pollutants that can enter food
    via contaminated soil, polluted air, and water.', '(1) More than 100 PAHs have
    been characterized in nature, of which benzoanthracene, cyclopentapyrene, chrysene,
    5-methylchrysene, benzofluoranthene, benzofluoranthene, benzofluoranthene, benzopyrene,
    indenopyrene, dibenzoanthracene, benzoperylene, dibenzopyrene, dibenzopyrene,
    dibenzopyrene, dibenzopyrene have been shown to possess carcinogenic, cytotoxic,
    and mutagenic activities.', "(2)\n\nThe formation of PAHs in food products during
    processing is mainly due to pyrolysis of organic components including fat, protein,
    and carbohydrate at temperatures &gt;200 \xB0C, especially at 500\u2013900 \xB0C.",
  '(3, 4) More specifically, lipids may drip onto the flame, generating PAHs in the
    smoke during heating, which in turn adhere to the food surface.', '(5) In addition,
    the incomplete combustion of charcoal can induce PAH formation, finding their
    way onto the food surface.', '(6, 7) Among the various PAHs, the low-molecular-weight
    ones with two or three aromatic rings were shown to be more labile to formation
    during grilling of meat.', '(8) However, those PAHs are classified as probably
    or possibly carcinogenic to humans and are less toxic as compared to the highly
    toxic benzopyrene with five aromatic rings.', '(9)


    Meat consumption in Taiwan among men and women is estimated to be 202.53 and 129.83
    g/day, respectively, with smoked meats becoming increasingly popular both at home
    and in restaurants because of their unique aroma and taste.', 'However, smoked
    foods often pose an elevated risk to human health due to the presence of high
    PAH contents.', '(4, 10-14)


    Smoking is one of the oldest food preservation methods.', "An official survey
    of PAH levels in Swedish smoked meat and fish reported many products contained
    benzopyrene ranging from 6.6 to 36.9 \u03BCg/kg.", '(14) Among the various products,
    ham processed by the traditional sauna smoking contained the highest level of
    benzopyrene, apparently caused by direct exposure to smoke from a flaming log.',
  'Additionally, the combustion temperature is particularly critical in affecting
    PAH formation in food products.', '(15) For instance, hot-smoked fish was shown
    to contain a higher level of PAHs than cold-smoked fish.', '(16) In addition to
    temperature, the amount of PAHs formed in smoked fish can be dependent upon type
    of fish, smoking methods, wood variety, smoke composition, and degree of exposure
    to smoke.', 'For example, a high content of benzopyrene was observed in fish skin
    smoked heavily in a traditional kiln, whereas a much lower content was shown in
    fish smoked mildly in a wood-containing house.', '(16) Likewise, benzopyrene was
    generated in direct-smoked belly ham, but could be reduced to &lt;0.3 ppb with
    an indirect smoking process.', '(17) Additionally, the wood nature, such as resin
    content, could favor PAH formation in smoked meat.', '(13) In a study dealing
    with the effect of the industrial smoking process on PAH formation, with liquid
    smoke the PAH contents could be reduced substantially.', '(18) Nevertheless, a
    high degree of contamination may occur because of smoldering and friction.', 'There
    are also differences in PAH contents in different types of meat with similar surface/mass
    ratio, as evident by a higher level of PAHs in beef hams processed in a traditional
    smokehouse than in an industrial smokehouse.', 'However, there was no significant
    difference in PAH contents in pork between those two processing methods.', '(12)


    Sugar-smoking, a popular cooking method involving precooking of meat in a marinade
    and then exposure to sugar for smoking in Taiwan, has been frequently used as
    it imparts a characteristic flavor and tenderness to meat products.', 'However,
    no information is available as to PAH generation in sugar-smoked meat products.',
  'The objectives of this study were to determine the PAH contents in sugar-smoked
    poultry meat, red meat, and seafood products by employing a quick, easy, cheap,
    effective, rugged, safe method combined with a GC-MS technique.', 'Meanwhile,
    the dietary exposure assessment of PAHs in Taiwan was conducted.', 'Sixteen PAH
    standards, including acenaphthene, acenaphthylene, anthracene, benzoanthracene,
    benzopyrene, benzofluoranthene, benzofluoranthene, benzoperylene, chrysene, dibenzoanthracene,
    fluoranthene, fluorene, indenopyrene, naphthalene, phenanthrene, and pyrene, were
    obtained from Supelco Co..', "The QuEChERS kits used to extract and purify PAHs
    from meat included a 50 mL Teflon centrifuge tube containing 6 g of magnesium
    sulfate and 1.5 g of sodium acetate and a 15 mL Teflon centrifuge tube packed
    with 1200 mg of MgSO4, 400 mg of primary\u2013secondary amine, and 400 mg of end-capped
    C18, both of which were purchased from Agilent Technologies.", The HPLC grade
    solvents were from Merck., Deionized water was made using a Barnstead Easypure
    II water purification system., 'Soy sauce was from Gin-Lan Food Co., whereas crystal
    sugar was from Taiwan Sugar Co..



    Meat samples were purchased from a local butcher shop in New Taipei City, Taiwan.',
  'Chicken drumstick, duck drumstick, chicken breast, chicken gizzard, and chicken
    heart were selected as they represented the most popular poultry commodities in
    Taiwan.', 'Likewise, red meat including pork chop, beef steak, lamb steak, ham,
    and pork knuckle were chosen, whereas salmon, shrimp, squid, octopus, and oyster
    were procured for seafood.', "Prior to processing, all meat samples were washed
    with tap water and weighed, followed by dividing each meat commodity into two
    portions and packaging into two separate plastic bags and storing at \u221220
    \xB0C freezer.", 'Among all of the meat samples, only oyster was purchased before
    cooking as freezing may cause a texture change.', The fat contents in all of the
    meat samples were determined by an ethyl ether extraction method(19) using a Soxhlet
    apparatus., Smoking is commonly used to process meat products in Taiwan to extend
    shelf life and impart characteristic flavor and tenderness., 'Unlike the traditional
    smoking process with wood as smoke source, in this study we used a sugar-smoking
    process instead.', 'In the beginning, a fixed number of each meat commodity with
    a total amount of 0.2, 0.8, 1.0, 1.8, 1.8, 1, 1, 0.8, 0.3, 1, 1, 0.2, 1, 0.6,
    and 0.1 kg for chicken heart, chicken gizzard, chicken breast, chicken drumstick,
    duck drumstick, pork steak, steak, lamb steak, ham, pork knuckle, salmon, shrimp,
    octopus, squid, and oyster, respectively, was premarinated in a 3-fold volume
    of juice containing 10% soy sauce and 1% crystal sugar.', "The premarinating time
    was selected on the basis of the internal temperature of various meat samples
    as recommended by the U.S. Department of Agriculture: 30 min and 81 \xB0C for
    chicken drumstick, 25 min and 82 \xB0C for duck drumstick, 10 min and 90 \xB0C
    for chicken breast, 10 min and 94 \xB0C for chicken gizzard, and 5 min and 90
    \xB0C for chicken heart; 10 min and 82 \xB0C for pork chop, 15 min and 96 \xB0C
    for beef steak, 10 min and 85 \xB0C for lamb steak, 5 min and 84 \xB0C for ham,
    and 20 min and 90 \xB0C for pork knuckle; 10 min and 84 \xB0C for salmon, 3 min
    and 85 \xB0C for shrimp, 15 min and 80 \xB0C for octopus, 10 min and 90 \xB0C
    for squid, and 5 min and 91 \xB0C for oyster.", 'After premarinating, about 112.5
    g of sugar was poured onto the bottom of a smoking pot, with one meat commodity
    being placed evenly on a metal screen above the pot.', Then the pot was covered
    with a lid with the smoking time being 3 or 6 min., "After smoking, all of the
    meat samples were deboned, vacuum-packaged, and stored at \u221220 \xB0C prior
    to PAH analysis.", "All of the meat samples were removed from the freezer, thawed
    at 4 \xB0C, and then ground by a mechanical blender prior to extraction and purification,
    which was performed according to a method described in a previous study.", '(20)
    A portion of 5 g of ground meat sample was taken and placed into a tube and then
    homogenized in 10 mL of deionized water for 1 min, followed by the addition of
    10 mL of acetonitrile and vigorous shaking for 1 min.', 'Then the QuEChERS containing
    6 g of MgSO4 and 1.5 g of CH3COONa was added, after which the tube was shaken
    for 1 min and centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 5 min.', 'Subsequently, 6 mL of the
    supernatant was collected and added to a QuEChERS cleanup tube containing 400
    mg of PSA, 1200 mg of MgSO4, and 400 mg of C18EC for purification, followed by
    centrifuging at 4000 rpm for 5 min.', "The supernatant was collected, and a 1
    \u03BCL aliquot was taken for injection into GC-MS for PAH analysis.", Identification
    and quantification of PAHs were accomplished using a GC-MS method as described
    previously., (20) An Agilent 30 m HP-5MS column connected with a 5 m guard column
    was installed to extend column life., Samples were injected in splitless mode
    with helium as carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min., "The GC operation conditions
    were as follows: injector temperature at 290 \xB0C, oven temperature at 70 \xB0C
    initially, raised to 195 \xB0C at 15 \xB0C/min and maintained for 2.5 min, raised
    to 240 \xB0C at 15 \xB0C/min and maintained for 17 min, raised to 270 \xB0C at
    5 \xB0C/min and to 310 \xB0C at 15 \xB0C/min with a holding time for 10 min; with
    these conditions a total of 16 PAHs were separated within 40 min.", "For MS conditions,
    the interface temperature was 270 \xB0C with an electron multiplier voltage of
    70 eV, and detection was performed by selected ion monitoring mode according to
    elution time and m/z of various PAHs.", 'Additionally, each PAH in samples was
    identified by comparing retention time and mass spectra of unknown peaks with
    those of authentic standards.', 'For quantification, 14 concentrations of each
    PAH were prepared, whereas 13 concentrations of benzoanthracene and chrysene,
    10 concentrations of benzofluoranthene and benzopyrene, 11 concentrations of indenopyrene
    and dibenzoanthracene, and 12 concentrations of benzoperylene were also prepared.',
  'The 16 PAH standard curves were thus obtained by plotting concentration against
    integrated peak area, and the amount of each PAH was calculated on the basis of
    its respective calibration curve.', The method validation was not carried out
    as high accuracy and precision have been demonstrated in a previous study., '(20)



    The approach used for carcinogenic risk assessment of PAHs in this study is based
    on the toxic equivalency factors, and comparative potency of various PAHs is estimated
    using benzopyrene as a surrogate.', '(21) The potency toxicity of benzopyrene
    is characterized with TEF as 1, which is then applied as a basis for calculation
    of toxicity equivalent of the other PAHs, including highly carcinogenic dibenzoanthracene,
    benzoanthracene, benzofluoranthene, benzofluoranthene, and indenopyrene; midcarcinogenic
    acenaphthylene, anthracene, fluoranthene, chrysene, and benzoperylene; low-carcinogenic
    acenaphthylene, acenaphthene, fluorene, phenanthrene; and noncarcinogenic naphthalene.',
  'The TEQ value for determination of dietary exposure assessment of PAHs was calculated
    aswhere TEQBP is the total TEQ level, converting as BaP using the TEFs of PAHs
    in food, Ci is the concentration of PAH congener i in food, and TEFi is the TEF
    of PAH congener i in food.', 'To assess cancer risk, the dietary exposure was
    calculated by prorating the total cumulative intake level over a lifetime to give
    lifelong average daily intake(22, 23) using the formulawhere TEQk is the total
    TEQ levels of PAHs in food k; EDj is the exposure duration j; IRkj is the average
    intake of food k in exposure duration j based on daily food consumption data of
    a nationwide dietary survey conducted in Taiwan, 2008, provided by the Academia
    Sinica, Taiwan;(23) BWj is the average body weight during exposure duration; and
    AT is the average lifespan for carcinogen.', "Duplicate analyses were conducted
    for all meat samples, and the mean values were subjected to ANOVA and Duncan\u2019s
    multiple-range test for significant difference among samples using SAS software.",
  '(24)





    Table 1 shows the PAH contents in sugar-smoked poultry products.', 'Among the
    various PAHs, only naphthalene was detected in chicken drumstick and chicken breast
    after 30 and 10 min of premarinating, respectively.', 'However, following sugar-smoking
    for 3 min, four new PAHs were generated in chicken heart, three PAHs each in chicken
    drumstick and chicken breast, six PAHs in chicken gizzard, and five PAHs in duck
    drumstick.', 'After extensive sugar-smoking for 6 min, several more PAHs were
    produced including acenaphthylene and pyrene in chicken gizzard and acenaphthene
    in chicken breast and chicken drumstick, accompanied by a loss of anthracene in
    chicken heart and phenanthrene in duck drumstick, probably caused by degradation
    or conversion to some other PAH derivatives.', 'Most importantly, benzopyrene
    remained undetected in sugar-smoked poultry meat, demonstrating a much safer processing
    method of sugar-smoking when compared to traditional smoking method with wood
    as smoke source.', 'For total PAHs, a pronounced rise was observed for all five
    poultry meat commodities after sugar-smoking for 3 or 6 min.', Table 1., "Concentrations
    of PAHsa in Premarinated and Sugar-Smoked Poultry Meat  \n\n\n\nMean of duplicate
    analyses \xB1 standard deviation.", Means of the same kind of poultry in the same
    row with different letters are significantly different., Means bearing different
    letters in the same column are significantly different., The PAH content changes
    in premarinated and sugar-smoked red meat are shown in Table 2., 'Likewise, after
    premarinating, only two PAHs were detected in beef steak, two PAHs in pork knuckle
    and pork chop, and one PAH in both ham and lamb steak.', 'However, after sugar-smoking
    for 3 min, some other PAHs were produced: acenaphthylene, acenaphthene, fluorene,
    and anthracene in beef steak; fluoranthene in pork knuckle; acenaphthene and phenanthrene
    in ham; fluorene in lamb steak; and acenaphthylene and fluoranthene in pork chop.',
  'Likewise, after prolonged sugar-smoking for 6 min, several new PAHs were shown:
    phenanthrene and pyrene in beef steak; acenaphthene, phenanthrene, anthracene,
    and pyrene in pork knuckle; fluorene in ham; acenaphthene, phenanthrene, anthracene,
    fluoranthrene, and pyrene in lamb steak; acenaphthene, phenanthrene, anthracene,
    and pyrene in pork chop.', 'Like poultry meat, no benzopyrene was detected in
    all five red meat commodities.', 'For total PAHs, a marked increment was found
    following sugar-smoking over a 6 min period.', Table 2., "Concentrations of PAHsa
    in Premarinated and Sugar-Smoked Red Meat  \n\n\n\nMean of duplicate analyses
    \xB1 standard deviation.", Means of the same kind of meat in the same row with
    different letters are significantly different., Means bearing different letters
    in the same column are significantly different., A similar tendency was observed
    in PAH varieties and contents during premarinating and sugar-smoking of seafood
    products., 'After premarinating, only naphthalene was detected in oyster, octopus,
    salmon, and shrimp, whereas no PAHs were detected in squid.', 'However, after
    sugar-smoking for 3 min, seven new PAHs including acenaphthylene, acenaphthene,
    fluorene, phenanthrene, anthracene, fluoranthene, and pyrene were generated in
    oyster only, whereas no PAHs were detected in squid.', 'After extensive sugar-smoking
    for 6 min, three more PAHs were produced in octopus, as were three PAHs in salmon,
    four PAHs in shrimp, and three PAHs in squid.', 'Also, no benzopyrene was detected
    in all five seafood commodities.', 'With the exception of oyster, a significant
    rise was shown for total PAHs in the other four seafood products over a sugar-smoking
    period for 6 min.', Table 3., "Concentrations of PAHsa in Premarinated and Sugar-Smoked
    Seafood  \n\n\n\nMean of duplicate analyses \xB1 standard deviation.", Means of
    the same kind of meat in the same row with different letters are significantly
    different., Means bearing different letters in the same column are significantly
    different., 'Comparatively, after sugar-smoking for 6 min, the total PAHs were
    produced in largest amount in lamb steak, followed by pork chop, beef steak, pork
    knuckle, oyster, chicken gizzard, ham, chicken heart, chicken drumstick, chicken
    breast, salmon, duck drumstick, squid, octopus, and shrimp.', 'More specifically,
    of the eight PAHs detected in chicken gizzard, beef steak, pork chop, and oyster,
    only fluoranthene was classified as carcinogenic by the U.S. Environmental Protection
    Agency,(25) implying the PAHs present in most meat commodities in this study did
    not show carcinogenicity.', 'As fluoranthene was present in minor amounts ranging
    from 0.2 to 1.7 ppb, this should not pose any health risk to human.', 'With the
    exception of benzopyrene, the other PAH levels were lower than those in meats
    treated with traditional wood smoking.', '(12)


    Among the various PAHs, the noncarcinogenic naphthalene was the most susceptible
    to formation during premarinating and subsequent sugar-smoking.', 'The formation
    mechanism of naphthalene has been well elucidated previously,(10) demonstrating
    that lipid oxidation and degradation products such as cyclohexane or hydroperoxide
    may undergo further oxidation or cyclization to form naphthalene or naphthalene-like
    compounds during heating of model lipids or food lipids.', "More specifically,
    the formation of cyclic compounds can also be due to the interaction between oleic
    acid and linoleic acid through Diels\u2013Alder reaction during heating, which
    in turn undergoes further polymerization to form PAHs or PAH derivatives.", '(10)
    Thus, the fat content in meat products used in our study should play a vital role
    in PAH formation.', 'In addition to fat content, the fatty acid composition is
    also important for PAH formation.', 'However, with the exception of lamb steak,
    the other 14 meat samples contained only a low amount of fat, which should explain
    why lamb steak contained a larger amount of total PAHs than the other meat commodities.',
  'Theoretically, the highly toxic benzopyrene containing five aromatic rings should
    be more difficult to generate than those PAHs with two to four rings.', 'Therefore,
    only under drastic heating conditions more lipid oxidation or degradation products
    were produced, and then the formation of benzopyrene could be possible.', '(10)
    As both the premarinating and sugar-smoking conditions are quite mild in this
    study, the formation of carcinogenic benzopyrene should be difficult.', 'According
    to previous literature reports, a high amount of benzopyrene could be generated
    during the traditional smoking process with wood as the major smoke source because
    of incomplete combustion of wood.', 'For instance, a high level of benzopyrene
    was reported to be present in high-fat smoked belly ham by a direct smoking process.',
  '(17) However, with an indirect smoking process the benzopyrene content in belly
    ham could be reduced to 0.3 ppb.', 'Similarly, low PAH formation was observed
    in meat products by employing an indirect process with smoke produced from an
    external smoke generator.', '(14) Alternatively, liquid smoke was also used to
    minimize PAH formation during smoking.', '(15) As mentioned above, the amount
    and kind of PAHs formed during smoking can also be greatly affected by wood variety,
    as shown by a larger level of total PAHs and benzopyrene with spruce wood when
    compared to apple or alder wood.', '(13) However, with beech wood as smoke source,
    only a low level of benzopyrene was formed in meat.', '(12) Compared to published
    reports, no benzopyrene was detected in sugar-smoked meat commodities in our study,
    demonstrating that sugar-smoking is superior to wood-smoking in preventing carcinogenic
    PAH formation, apparently due to a much milder smoking condition of the former.',
  'Although the traditional wood-smoking process was not carried out in this study,
    the absence of benzopyrene in sugar-smoked meat can still be used as a basis for
    comparison with that in wood-smoked meat in the literature as the GC-MS methods
    employed in this study can separate and quantify benzopyrene accurately.', 'Thus,
    the sugar-smoking process can be adopted instead of the traditional smoking process
    for future meat processing.', 'With the exception of beef steak and pork chop,
    the TEQBaP values in most premarinated samples remained nil, mainly due to the
    presence of noncarcinogenic naphthalene.', "The total PAH TEQBaP levels in meat
    after sugar-smoking for 3 min ranged from 0.003 \xB1 0.000 to 0.013 \xB1 0.002,
    from 0.001 \xB1 0.000 to 0.008 \xB1 0.001, and from 0.000 to 0.030 \xB1 0.002
    for poultry meat, red meat, and seafood, respectively.", 'Among the various meat
    commodities, oyster was shown to possess the highest TEQBaP, which should be due
    to the presence of midcarcinogenic PAHs including acenaphthylene, anthracene,
    and fluoranthrene.', "Additionally, an increase in sugar-smoking time led to a
    higher TEQBaP level ranging from 0.006 \xB1 0.000 to 0.018 \xB1 0.001, from 0.007
    \xB1 0.000 to 0.041 \xB1 0.002, and from 0.003 \xB1 0.000 to 0.032 \xB1 0.002
    for poultry meat, red meat, and seafood, respectively, which can also be attributed
    to the presence of high amounts of midcarcinogenic PAHs.", "TEQ is calculated
    by summing each PAH\u2019s respective BaP toxicity equivalent factor expressed
    in \u03BCg/kg.", Epidemiological studies have demonstrated that frequent consumption
    of grilled or smoked meat products prepared by traditional process involving a
    direct contact between food and smoke generated by combustion is responsible for
    the high incidence of stomach cancer., '(26-28) Levels of carcinogenic benzopyrene
    in smoked meat products have been recently reported to be present in meat, fish,(4)
    ham by direct sauna method, pork, lamb leg, and salmon.', '(7) As indicated before,
    wood type, processing temperature, and smoking methods can strongly influence
    the amount of benzopyrene formed.', 'Unlike the traditional wood-smoking process,
    meats that are to be sugar-smoked are subjected to premarinating and then a shortened
    time of subsequent smoking for prevention of benzopyrene formation.', 'However,
    the detailed mechanism needs further investigation.', 'LADI regarding lifespan
    and dietary exposure to PAHs was evaluated to assess health risk in Taiwan, and
    the results indicated most LADI of PAH values were insignificant, especially in
    both aged male and female subjects.', 'The highest LADI values of 0.007 and 0.004
    ng/kg BW/day were observed for male adults and female adults over a 79 year lifespan
    in Taiwan, respectively.', 'Accordingly, the LADI values for adults were higher
    than for the elderly.', 'Likewise, the LADI values for male adults were larger
    than for female adults.', 'Among the various meat products, red meat consumed
    by male subjects showed a higher PAH dietary exposure, whereas seafood was the
    lowest in PAH dietary exposure.', "Subsequently, the cancer risk induced by PAHs
    was assessed on the basis of the carcinogenic potency factor of benzopyrene, 7.3\u22121,
    as suggested by IRIS of the U.S. EPA based on the incidence of forestomach cancer
    in the rat.", "(25) Then, each PAH convener in foods was converted into TEQBaP
    value based on benzopyrene cancer potency and LADI, and the cancer risks of all
    sugar-smoked meat samples were estimated to be &lt;2 \xD7 10\u20137.", 'According
    to the U.S. EPA, excess human cancer risk of one in a million over a 70 year lifespan
    is considered to be an acceptable or inconsequential level, whereas a one in ten
    thousand chance of excess cancer risk is considered to be a serious level.', '(25,
    29) The cancer risk of sugar-smoked meat is lower than the acceptable level; thus,
    our study demonstrates a much lower cancer risk of sugar-smoked meat.', 'Nevertheless,
    we have to point out that the health risk was assessed on the basis of the total
    intake amount of meat as no information is available as to the consumption data
    of sugar-smoked meat in Taiwan.', 'On the basis of the fact that the intake amount
    of sugar-smoked meat is lower than the total amount of meat, the dietary exposure
    of PAHs for the former should be even lower.', Table 5., "Lifelong Average Daily
    Dietary Intakea of PAHs from Sugar-Smoked Meat Products in Taiwan  \n\n\n\nLADI
    is calculated by summing \xD7 \xD7/(body weight \xD7 average life span in Taiwan,
    ca.", 79 years)., 'The present study demonstrates, for the first time, the PAH
    formation in sugar-smoked poultry meat, red meat, and seafood products.', 'As
    no carcinogenic benzopyrene was detected and low cancer risk was calculated, the
    sugar-smoking process can be adopted to replace the frequently used wood-smoking
    process to prevent carcinogenic PAH formation.', 'This study was supported by
    Grant 100TFDA-TC-101 from the Department of Health, Taiwan.']
