['Later menopause is a risk factor for breast and endometrial cancer, yet few studies
    have investigated dietary predictors of this potentially modifiable event.', 'In
    particular, dairy contains hormones and growth factors that could potentially
    impact menopausal timing.', We therefore assessed the association between regular
    consumption of dairy foods and related nutrients and age at natural menopause.,
  "We conducted a prospective analysis with up to 20 y of follow-up in 46,059 participants
    in the Nurses\u2019 Health Study who were premenopausal in 1980.", 'We observed
    30,816 events of natural menopause over 401,754 person-years.', "In the total
    population, the estimated mean age at natural menopause was 51.5 y for women who
    consumed no low-fat dairy and 51.5, 51.6, 51.7, and 51.8 y for women who consumed
    0.1\u20131.0, 1.1\u20132.0, 2.1\u20133.0, and &gt;3 servings of low-fat dairy
    daily, respectively.", "Premenopausal women ;51 y of age consuming &gt;3 servings
    of low-fat dairy per day were 14% less likely to report natural menopause in the
    next month relative to those consuming 0.1\u20131 servings/d.", Similar results
    were obtained for skim milk but not for total high-fat dairy or whole milk., "Dairy
    foods were not associated with age at menopause among women \u226551 y of age.",
  These findings support the growing body of literature on the hormonally active nature
    of milk and dairy foods.]
