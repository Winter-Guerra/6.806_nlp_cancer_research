['Soy foods are the richest sources of isoflavones, mainly daidzein and genistein.',
  "Soy isoflavones are structurally similar to the steroid hormone 17\xCE\xB2-estradiol
    and may protect against breast cancer.", "S-(\u2212)equol, a metabolite of the
    soy isoflavone daidzein, has a higher bioavailability and greater affinity for
    estrogen receptor \xCE\xB2 than daidzein.", "Approximately one-third of the Western
    population is able to produce S-(\u2212)equol, and the ability is linked to certain
    gut microbes.", "We hypothesized that the prevalence of breast cancer, ductal
    hyperplasia, and overall breast pathology will be lower among S-(\u2212)equol
    producing, as compared with nonproducing, postmenopausal women undergoing a breast
    biopsy.", We tested our hypothesis using a cross-sectional study design., Usual
    diets of the participants were supplemented with 1 soy bar per day for 3 consecutive
    days., "Liquid chromatography-multiple reaction ion monitoring mass spectrometry
    analysis of urine from 143 subjects revealed 25 as S-(\u2212)equol producers.",
  "We found no statistically significant associations between S-(\u2212)equol producing
    status and overall breast pathology, ductal hyperplasia, or breast cancer.", 'However,
    the mean dietary isoflavone intake was much lower than in previous reports.',
  "Given that the amount of S-(\u2212)equol produced in the gut depends on the amount
    of daidzein exposure, the low soy intake coupled with lower prevalence of S-(\u2212)equol
    producing status in the study population favors toward null associations.", "Findings
    from our study could be used for further investigations on S-(\u2212)equol producing
    status and disease risk."]
