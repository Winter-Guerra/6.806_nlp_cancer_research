    Natural products have potential as a source of diverse bioactive compounds with
    immunomodulatory properties.', Phytochemicals contained within black raspberries
    or their active metabolites are of particular interest for modulating the response
    to inflammatory stimuli or dysregulated immunity in patients with cancer., The
    rationale for their utility in this setting originates from epidemiological studies
    in which fruit and vegetable consumption was inversely related to oral cancer
    incidence ., 'Among the fruits, BRB are of interest as they contain numerous compounds
    in which some have demonstrated to have cancer fighting activity .', 'These dietary
    natural substances have been utilized with the intention of benefit either as
    a whole food, providing complex mixtures of phytochemicals or metabolites, as
    a topical intervention applied directly to cutaneous and mucosal surfaces, or
    as a source of lead compounds for drug development.', 'In fact, black raspberry
    extracts have been shown to inhibit proliferation and promote apoptosis of both
    premalignant and malignant cells .', Other reports have demonstrated that administration
    of a diet enriched with black raspberries inhibits carcinogenesis in preclinical
    tumor models ., 'Despite these findings, little is known regarding the mechanisms
    by which bioactive phytochemicals present within black raspberries or their metabolites
    modulate immunological factors relevant to tumor development and inflammatory
    processes.', T lymphocytes are essential cellular regulators of inflammatory processes
    and a key component in cancer immunosurveillance., Several phenotypic subsets
    of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells can be activated to proliferate and secrete cytokines
    via exposure to foreign antigens and inflammatory signals., Manipulation of T
    cells via either adoptive transfer  or checkpoint blockade  has also emerged as
    promising immunotherapeutic approaches against cancer., 'Conversely, regulatory
    T cells are a distinct subset of lymphocytes that inhibit cytotoxic CD8+ T cell
    responses against tumors, and their frequency is increased in patients with ovarian,
    breast, and pancreatic cancer .', 'Therefore, identifying how dietary phytochemicals
    and metabolites act upon specific T cell subsets could be relevant to understanding
    the impact upon inflammatory processes, carcinogenesis, and even immunotherapy.',
  'Indeed, the premise that T lymphocyte function can be positively or negatively
    modulated via compounds derived from natural products has been demonstrated.',
  "For example, dietary grape proanthocyanidins were shown to enhance CD8+ T cell
    responses and the production of IL-12 and IFN-\u03B3 in a murine model of UVB
    radiation-induced skin carcinogenesis .", Other studies have shown that topical
    administration of an extract from lyophilized BRB could limit skin carcinogenesis
    and decrease the number of intratumoral T regs ., 'Finally, curcumin has been
    shown to negatively regulate T cell proliferation .', These data highlight the
    potential for pleiotropic effects of natural products on T cell function., Activation
    of the signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 signal transduction
    pathway in both transformed and inflammatory cells contributes to inflammation
    and carcinogenesis ., This pathway is also important for the expansion of myeloid-derived
    suppressor cells., 'This heterogeneous cell population mobilizes from bone marrow
    to peripheral tissues during inflammatory events, such as infection, sepsis, and
    cancer .', 'Recent work by our group and others indicates that MDSC prime metastatic
    sites prior to arrival of tumor cells, and elevated MDSC are a poor prognostic
    marker in patients with malignancy .', MDSC maintain a feed-forward loop of pro-inflammatory
    cytokines and inhibit cytotoxic lymphocytes from eliminating tumors ., 'Therefore,
    studying factors that regulate MDSC development and targeting these cells represent
    areas of priority for understanding how chronic inflammation leads to cancer.',
  'Despite their role in carcinogenesis, only limited studies using 25-hydroxyvitamin
    D3, curcumin, Withaferin A, or Polyphenol E have examined how natural products
    regulate MDSC biology .', We hypothesized that compounds within black raspberries
    or their physiologically relevant metabolites are capable of eliciting potent
    immunomodulatory properties that impact cellular mediators of chronic inflammation
    and tumor progression., 'In the present report, we assessed the immunomodulatory
    actions of an ethanol extract from black raspberries, and two abundant phytochemical
    metabolites of BRB produced upon ingestion.', 'Although not present within the
    complex BRB-E, C3R is a major anthocyanin metabolite of black raspberry while
    Q3R is an abundant quercetin metabolite observed following ingestion of berries
    .', 'These compounds were capable of limiting human T cell proliferation, survival,
    and MDSC differentiation in vitro.', 'Further mechanistic studies revealed that
    BRB-E, C3R, and Q3R could inhibit cytokine-induced phosphorylation of specific
    STAT proteins.', Together our studies provide novel data identifying how mixtures
    of black raspberry bioactive components and specific metabolites may impact T
    cell and MDSC biology that is relevant to carcinogenesis and cancer immunotherapy.,
  'An ethanol extract from lyophilized black raspberry power, intended to contain

    Upon introduction into a physiological system, phytochemicals within black raspberries

    two physiologically relevant BRB metabolites not present within the complex BRB-E,

    of the important abundant quercetin metabolites observed following ingestion of
    berries.', 'In contrast to experiments using BRB-E, culturing PBMC or activated
    T cells with either C3R or Q3R metabolites had no significant effect on the viability
    of healthy donor T cells activated with CD3/CD8 beads in the presence of C3R and
    Q3R for 3 days.', A significant decrease in both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell proliferation
    was also observed when cells were cultured with the anthocyanin metabolite C3R
    and quercetin metabolite Q3R., The effect of these two metabolites on MDSC differentiation
    was also evaluated., PBMCs from healthy donors were co-cultured with Q3R and C3R

    to its documented role in mediating MDSC differentiation and the fact that both
    IL-6 and GM-CSF promote its phosphorylation ., 'Furthermore, prior studies have
    shown that anthocyanins and quercetin can inhibit STAT3 signaling .', 'To determine
    the effect of BRB-E or the physiologically relevant C3R and Q3R metabolites on

    of BRB-E reduced STAT3 phosphorylation on the Tyr705 residue in response to IL-6.,
  'However, BRB-E could also inhibit IL-2-induced STAT5 phosphorylation in a concentration-dependent
    manner suggesting a broad degree of specificity for cytokine-induced activation

    STAT5 phosphorylation with increasing concentrations of BRB-E, with little or
    no effect when cells were cultured with C3R or Q3R, even at concentrations of

    bioactive compounds from black raspberries has immunomodulatory properties relevant
    to human T lymphocyte proliferation, survival, and myeloid cell differentiation.',
  'We also found that physiologically relevant anthocyanin and quercetin phytochemical
    metabolites likely to be encountered by the body following BRB consumption could
    modulate human T lymphocyte proliferation and MDSC differentiation, respectively.',
  'These findings are relevant as there is currently interest in black raspberries,
    anthocyanins, or quercetin as natural product-based complementary and alternative
    medicine interventions for both cancer prevention and inhibiting processes associated
    with chronic inflammation .', 'In fact, recent estimates indicate that 38 % of
    adults and likely greater proportions of oncology patients in the US use some
    form of CAM .', 'Thus, although the use of natural products as a means to impact
    disease processes is attractive in terms of safety and compliance and is founded
    on epidemiologic data , well-controlled studies on the biologic impact of berry
    components or other CAM upon human immune cells are greatly lacking.', 'Although
    various bioactive fractions of black raspberries are known to have anti-proliferative
    and pro-apoptotic effects against premalignant and malignant cells, this report
    represents the first demonstrating these fractions or physiologically relevant
    metabolites have modulatory activity upon human immune cells that may positively
    or negatively influence cancer therapy or prevention.', The notion that bioactive
    components or metabolites derived from foods impact immune function could have
    implications in a number of clinical settings in patients with established cancers.,
  "In theory, these interactions could alter the response to immune-based cancer therapies
    or the ability of the body\u2019s endogenous immune system to recognize and eliminate
    developing tumors.", 'To date, a limited number of other studies suggest BRB may
    have anti-inflammatory effects in a clinical setting .', 'For example, Mentor-Marcel
    et al.', conducted a clinical trial in colorectal cancer patients using oral administration
    of freeze-dried black raspberry powder in a slurry of water., 'Following 3 weeks
    of treatment, serum levels of increased GM-CSF and decreased IL-8 were observed
    .', "In a second study, BRB was orally administered at 5 % in the diet, based
    on average body weight to patients with Barrett\u2019s esophagus, a premalignant
    condition that confers increased risk for esophageal cancer.", The authors observed
    a reduction in oxidative stress markers important for malignant transformation
    in this subset of patients ., These early-stage clinical studies support the idea
    that BRB might decrease inflammatory mediators tied with induction of immunosupppresive
    populations relevant to patients with cancer., 'However, the mechanism by which
    BRB or their metabolites modulate these or other populations of human immune cells
    has not been considered to date.', 'Results from this report indicate that BRB
    and its prominent phytochemical metabolites can directly modulate the proliferation,
    survival, and differentiation of immune cells.', This study represents the first
    report demonstrating that bioactive components in BRB or metabolites can modulate
    differentiation of human MDSC., 'Not only did these studies conclude that BRB-E
    can limit MDSC differentiation in vitro, but also a portion of their suppressive
    activity.', 'However, the metabolites C3R and Q3R did not alter the suppressive
    activity of MDSC.', 'This is in contrast to the more complex mixture of BRB-E,
    and these data suggest the mixture of individual bioactive compounds within BRB-E
    may have distinct immunomodulatory properties as compared to the metabolites.',
  MDSC are upregulated in patients with cancer and represent a significant barrier
    to immune-mediated recognition of tumors ., 'Thus, there is great interest in
    identifying novel compounds or strategies that could control MDSC expansion.',
  Many studies have demonstrated that agents with direct activity against tumor cells
    also inhibit expansion or viability of MDSC., 'For example, several chemotherapeutic
    approaches, including docetaxol, gemcitabine, and all-trans retinoic acid, are
    directly toxic to MDSC .', 'A limited number of targeted, small molecule inhibitors,
    including sunitinib can also reduce MDSC expansion .', 'Of all the studies examining
    the use of natural products for cancer, only 25-hydroxyvitamin D3, curcumin, Withaferin
    A, and Polyphenol E have been investigated as a means to modulate MDSC and resulting
    immune responses .', These data suggest that dietary products may serve as novel
    sources of compounds that can be used to modulate phenotypic and functional properties
    of the immune system., 'In addition to altered myeloid cell differentiation, BRB-E
    inhibited survival and proliferation of human T lymphocytes in vitro.', These
    data were quite interesting and could be interpreted a number of ways., It is
    important to appreciate the diverse role for multiple T lymphocyte subsets in
    regulating the antitumor immune response., 'For example, inhibiting proliferation
    of immune suppressive T regs could be beneficial to the host.', 'In line with
    this, our data indicated that BRB-E limit IL-2-induced STAT5 phosphorylation,
    a pathway of importance to T regulatory cell expansion and survival.', 'Further,
    prior in vivo studies showed that topical administration of BRB inhibited skin
    carcinogenesis and decreased intratumoral T regs .', 'Conversely, there remains
    the possibility that the BRB effect might also abrogate expansion or survival
    of tumor-specific, cytotoxic T lymphocytes.', 'This is particularly relevant to
    potent and promising immune therapies, including T cell checkpoint blockade or
    adoptively transferred T cells.', One area of potential importance is delineating
    how BRB can interact with epithelial or mucosal cell layers to modulate the host
    response to various innate immune stimuli., 'These stimuli may be derived from
    biofilms, normal commensal bacteria, or cellular debris created in response to
    inflammatory insults.', This is particularly relevant as very high concentrations
    of BRB can be achieved at these sites., The opportunity for direct and longer
    exposure at these areas may provide for a more potent local immune modulating
    effect., 'Indeed, prior studies have provided evidence that anthocyanins and quercetins
    can reduce biofilm development, formation, and adhesion .', 'Implementation of
    BRB or their bioactive components as a therapeutic or preventative intervention
    in humans is attractive, but will require a number of important considerations.',
  'For example, a number of factors influence tissue distribution of bioactive compounds
    from berries .', 'First, with regard to dietary administration, the food matrix
    has a profound impact upon metabolism and absorption .', 'Second, genetic differences
    between individuals may influence metabolism of bioactive compounds within raspberries.',
  'Third, the oral, intestinal, or cutaneous microbiota can process raspberry-based
    interventions to generate additional metabolites that could vary between individuals.',
  'Thus, although this approach holds promise, implementing it for benefit of patients
    will require a concerted, multi-disciplinary effort and complex analytical capabilities
    to detect metabolites in human tissue.', 'Finally, data from this study also suggest
    that black raspberries may serve as a source of compounds that could be further
    manipulated to develop potent, pathway specific inhibitors.', "This \u201Creductionist\u201D
    approach using natural products often serves as a foundation for drug development.",
  'In particular, our data point to BRB-E or its metabolites as potential inhibitors
    of the STAT3 and STAT5 signal transduction pathways.', These pro-inflammatory
    pathways are particularly attractive for cancer therapy due to their dual role
    as both oncogenes in malignant cells and dominant pathways promoting immune suppression
    in myeloid and lymphoid cells ., 'Interestingly, we observed that the quercetin
    metabolite Q3R, but not C3R, inhibited STAT3 phosphorylation with little effect
    on STAT5 phosphorylation.', 'Thus, the specific compounds within BRB-E with inhibitory
    activity against STAT signaling or its upstream activating stimuli have yet to
    be identified; however, this remains an area of future research.', 'In summary,
    we have demonstrated that black raspberries are a source of bioactive components
    and metabolites that have potential for modulating T lymphocyte and myeloid cell
    survival and differentiation.', These natural products also serve as a novel source
    of inhibitors of STAT-mediated signal transduction., These studies suggest that
    black raspberries may have utility for both therapeutic intervention and as a
