['Allicin, one of the major components of garlic, has wide-ranging health properties.',
  'However, the effects of allicin on migration and invasion of breast cancer cells
    remain unknown.', "Allicin inhibited TNF-\xCE\xB1-induced VCAM-1 protein expression
    in MCF-7, but not in MDA-MB-231.", 'Additionally, allicin significantly reduced
    tumor cell migration and invasion only in MCF-7 cells.', "Our results also demonstrated
    that protein interaction between ER-\xCE\xB1 and p65 was down-regulated by TNF-\xCE\xB1
    treatment, and this effect was reversed by allicin.", "Moreover, the inhibition
    of ER-\xCE\xB1 expression markedly enhanced TNF-\xCE\xB1-induced migration and
    invasion of MCF-7 cells.", "Allicin strongly suppressed TNF-\xCE\xB1-induced activation
    of ERK1/2.", "Collectively, these results suggest that allicin inhibited the TNF-\xCE\xB1-mediated
    induction of VCAM-1 through blocking ERK1/2 and NF-\xCE\xBAB signaling pathways
    and enhancing interaction between ER-\xCE\xB1 and p65, leading to the suppression
    of invasion and metastasis of MCF-7 cells.", 'Therefore, allicin could be useful
    for preventing the advancement of breast cancer.']
