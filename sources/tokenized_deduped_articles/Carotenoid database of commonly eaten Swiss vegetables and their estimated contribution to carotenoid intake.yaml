[Carotenoids are plant pigments which are thought to decrease the risk of degenerative
    diseases via their antioxidant properties., 'The aim of this work was to create
    a carotenoid database for clearly identified Swiss vegetables, grown under known
    conditions and analyzed using a standardized protocol.', We determined the six
    major carotenoids in the vegetables most frequently consumed in Switzerland.,
  Chlorophyll a and b were additionally measured in green leafy vegetables., "Lutein
    and \xCE\xB2-carotene concentrations in green leafy vegetables ranged from 0.2
    to 13 mg and 0.2 to 8 mg/100 g fresh matter, respectively, with the highest total
    carotenoid contents in Brassicaceae.", "Additionally, we identified strong correlations
    between the lutein and \xCE\xB2-carotene concentrations and the total chlorophyll
    contents in different botanical families.", "Orange and red vegetables contained
    a greater diversity of carotenoids, with \xCE\xB1- and \xCE\xB2-carotene being
    the predominant carotenoids in orange carrots and lycopene in tomatoes.", "Peppers
    additionally contained zeaxanthin and \xCE\xB2-cryptoxanthin.", "Based on these
    data, and on the estimated consumption of the different vegetables in Switzerland,
    we estimate that 3.3 mg \xCE\xB2-carotene, 2.2 mg lycopene and 1.8 mg lutein are
    consumed daily from fresh vegetables."]
