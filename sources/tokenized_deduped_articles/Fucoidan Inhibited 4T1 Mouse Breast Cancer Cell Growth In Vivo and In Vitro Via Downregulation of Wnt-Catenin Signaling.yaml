[Fucoidan is a sulfated polysaccharide derived from brown algae and is known to possess
    anticancer properties., "However, the relationship between fucoidan and \u03B2-catenin,
    one of the key components of the Wnt signaling pathway, in mouse breast cancer
    remains poorly characterized.", "In this study, mouse breast cancer cells were
    exposed to fucoidan to investigate the relationship between fucoidan and the Wnt/\u03B2-catenin
    signaling pathway in vivo and in vitro.", 'We found that fucoidan significantly
    inhibited cell growth, increased cell death, and induced G1 cell cycle arrest
    in 4T1 cells.', "Fucoidan also reduced \u03B2-catenin expression and T cell factor/lymphoid-enhancing
    factor reporter activity.", 'Furthermore, fucoidan downregulated the expression
    of downstream target genes such as c-myc, cyclin D1, and survivin.', Intraperitoneal
    injection of fucoidan in tumor-bearing mice reduced the tumor volume and weight.,
  "Fucoidan induced aberrant downregulation of \u03B2-catenin in tumor tissues with
    a significant increase in apoptosis.", "Thus, our data suggested that fucoidan
    exerts its anticancer activity through downregulation of Wnt/\u03B2-catenin signaling.",
  Fucoidan may be an effective therapy for the chemoprevention and treatment of mouse
    breast cancer.]
