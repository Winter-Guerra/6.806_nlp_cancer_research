['Both PI3K/AKT/mTOR/S6K1 and mitogen activated protein kinase signaling cascades
    play an important role in cell proliferation, survival, angiogenesis, and metastasis
    of tumor cells.', "In the present report, we investigated the effects of \xCE\xB2-caryophyllene
    oxide, a sesquiterpene isolated from essential oils of medicinal plants such as
    guava, oregano, cinnamon clove, and black pepper on the PI3K/AKT/mTOR/S6K1 and
    MAPK activation pathways in human prostate and breast cancer cells.", 'We found
    that CPO not only inhibited the constitutive activation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR/S6K1
    signaling cascade; but also caused the activation of ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPK in
    tumor cells.', 'CPO induced increased reactive oxygen species generation from
    mitochondria, which is associated with the induction of apoptosis as characterized
    by positive Annexin V binding and TUNEL staining, loss of mitochondrial membrane
    potential, release of cytochrome c, activation of caspase-3, and cleavage of PARP.',
  Inhibition of ROS generation by N-acetylcysteine significantly prevented CPO-induced
    apoptosis., 'Subsequently, CPO also down-regulated the expression of various downstream
    gene products that mediate cell proliferation, survival, metastasis, angiogenesis,
    and increased the expression of p53 and p21.', 'Interestingly, we also observed
    that CPO can significantly potentiate the apoptotic effects of various pharmacological
    PI3K/AKT inhibitors when employed in combination in tumor cells.', 'Overall, these
    findings suggest that CPO can interfere with multiple signaling cascades involved
    in tumorigenesis and used as a potential therapeutic candidate for both the prevention
    and treatment of cancer.']
