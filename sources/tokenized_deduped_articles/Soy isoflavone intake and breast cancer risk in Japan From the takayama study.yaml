[The effects of soy or isoflavone intake on breast cancer need to be examined further
    in epidemiologic studies., We assessed the associations of soy and isoflavone
    intake with breast cancer incidence in a population-based prospective cohort study
    in Japan., 'Participants were members from the Takayama study, aged 35 years or
    older in 1992.', The follow-up was conducted from the time of the baseline study
    to the end of March 2008., Cancer incidence was mainly confirmed through regional
    population-based cancer registries., Breast cancer was defined as code C50 according
    to ICD-10., Soy and isoflavone intakes were assessed with a validated food frequency
    questionnaire., 'Using the Cox proportional hazard models, the association of
    soy and isoflavone intake with breast cancer was assessed after adjustments for
    age, body mass index, physical activity, smoking, alcohol consumption, education,
    age at menarche, age at first delivery, menopausal status, number of children
    and history of hormone replacement therapy.', 'Among the 15,607 women analyzed,
    172 had developed breast cancer.', 'The relative risks of postmenopausal breast
    cancer were lower among women with higher intakes of soy and isoflavone, although
    the relative risks of premenopausal breast cancer were not associated with intakes
    of soy and isoflavone.', Decreased risks of breast cancer were found even among
    women with a moderate intake of soy and isoflavone., These results suggested that
    soy and isoflavone intakes have a protective effect on postmenopausal breast cancer.]
