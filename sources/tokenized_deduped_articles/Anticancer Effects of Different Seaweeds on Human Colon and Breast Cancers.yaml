[': Seafoods and seaweeds represent some of the most important reservoirs of new therapeutic
    compounds for humans.', 'Seaweed has been shown to have several biological activities,
    including anticancer activity.', 'This review focuses on colorectal and breast
    cancers, which are major causes of cancer-related mortality in men and women.',
  It also describes various compounds extracted from a range of seaweeds that have
    been shown to eradicate or slow the progression of cancer., Fucoidan extracted
    from the brown algae Fucus spp., has shown activity against both colorectal and
    breast cancers., 'Furthermore, we review the mechanisms through which these compounds
    can induce apoptosis in vitro and in vivo.', 'By considering the ability of compounds
    present in seaweeds to act against colorectal and breast cancers, this review
    highlights the potential use of seaweeds as anticancer agents.', Cancers are a
    group of diseases characterized by uncontrolled cell growth and spread ., 'Colorectal
    cancer is the third most common cancer in the world, with nearly 1.4 million new
    cases diagnosed in 2012 .', 'Moreover, the incidence of this disease has increased
    steadily in recent years .', 'Despite advances in therapeutic interventions over
    the past few decades, the mortality rate of patients diagnosed with colorectal
    cancer remains approximately 40%, mainly due to metastasis to the liver .', Breast
    cancer is the leading cause of death among women in many countries ., 'This is
    the second most common cancer overall, with nearly 1.7 million new cases diagnosed
    worldwide in 2012 .', 'As breast cancer progresses, survival factors that inhibit
    apoptotic cell death are expressed by the cancer cells .', 'Due to the increasing
    incidence of cancer in both developing and developed countries, the use of new
    chemotherapeutic molecules is needed .', Employing natural or synthetic agents
    to prevent or suppress the progression of invasive cancers has recently been recognized
    as an approach with enormous potential ., 'Seaweeds are extensively used as functional
    foods and medicinal herbs, and have a long history of use in Asian countries .',
  'Since certain seaweeds have long been used for the treatment of cancer, many crude
    or partially purified polysaccharides from various brown, green, and red algae
    have been tested for their antitumor activities .', These studies have indicated
    that marine algae constitute a promising source of novel compounds with potential
    as human therapeutic agents., 'In particular, algae have been considered as a
    potential source of new bioactive compounds .', Several studies have reported
    that compounds extracted from seaweed may be effective anticancer agents., This
    review summarizes the various effects of seaweed-derived compounds on colorectal
    and breast cancers via promotion of cancer cell apoptosis., '+: effects reported;
    -: no effects reported; IC50 = the half-maximal inhibitory concentration; Seaweeds
    with two IC50 values had two different therapeutic compounds tested;  Cellfood
    designates all of the mineral salts and trace elements extracted from seaweeds.',
  Colorectal cancer is one of the most common cancers in men and women and it is particularly
    prevalent in developed countries., 'The worldwide incidence of this cancer has
    increased steadily in recent years, and this has been attributed to rapid changes
    in dietary patterns and preferences.', 'Dietary habits can influence the risk
    for colorectal cancer , and the identification of food components that can prevent
    the tumorigenic process may contribute to the development of effective anti-colorectal
    cancer agents .', Many investigations have aimed to find effective ways to combat
    colorectal cancer., 'Some studies have reported that colorectal cancer can be
    successfully treated with marine natural products, which contain an abundance
    of biologically active substances with novel chemical structures and favorable
    pharmacological activities .', 'The inhibition of apoptosis in colorectal cancer
    cells enhances tumor growth, promotes neoplastic progression, and confers resistance
    to cytotoxic anticancer agents .', 'Thus, bioactive compounds that induce apoptosis
    in cancer cells can be used as agents for cancer chemoprevention and/or chemotherapy
    .', 'Accumulating evidence suggests that bioactive compounds extracted from algae
    produce anticancer effects through multiple mechanisms of action, including inhibition
    of cancer cell growth, invasion, and metastasis, and through the induction of
    apoptosis in cancer cells .', Apoptosis may be initiated either by an intrinsic
    pathway or by an extrinsic pathway ., Each of these pathways involves the activation
    of caspases and ultimately leads to apoptosis ., 'Consumption of various types
    of seafood, including seaweed, has been suggested to be responsible for the low
    incidence of cancer in Japan and in other countries whose inhabitants traditionally
    consume high levels of marine organisms .', Numerous studies have examined the
    effects of seaweeds on apoptotic pathways., "The effects of laminarin, a storage
    glycan composed of \u03B2-glycan found in brown algae, on colorectal cancer cells
    were investigated as well as the mechanisms through which laminarin induced apoptosis
    in these cells.", Treatment with laminarin from Laminaria spp., 'inhibited the
    proliferation of colon cancer cells via Fas and IGF-IR signaling through the intrinsic
    apoptotic and ErbB pathways, respectively .', 'According to previous studies,
    Fas and Fas receptors induced the activation of members of the caspase family,
    leading to cleavage of apoptosis markers such as poly polymerase .', 'Other studies
    showed that laminarin regulated Fas and FADD protein levels, suggesting that it
    induced Fas-mediated apoptosis.', 'Laminarin also increased the expression of
    Fas and FADD, which also increased the activation of caspases .', 'ErbB receptors
    control key pathways that govern cellular processes such as proliferation, cell
    migration, metabolism, and survival .', 'Dysregulation of the ErbB receptor signal
    transduction pathway is observed in several types of cancer, including colon cancer.',
  Abnormal activation of the ErbB receptor is thought to be one of the potential causes
    of cancer ., Laminarin decreased Bcl-2 family protein expression and inhibited
    cell cycle progression by regulating the ErbB signaling pathway ., 'These studies
    also showed that treatment of HT-29 cells with laminarin inhibited phosphorylation
    and ErbB2 expression, as well as the phosphorylation of Akt.', 'Fucoidan, a sulfated
    polysaccharide often found in brown algae, has shown a number of biological effects
    including anticancer activities .', 'A range of fucoidan structures and compositions
    exist in diverse brown seaweed species; however, in general the compound consists
    primarily of l-fucose and sulfate, along with small quantities of d-galactose,
    d-mannose, d-xylose, and uronic acid .', 'Recently, the diverse biological activities
    of fucoidan have been studied intensively, including its anticancer activities
    .', Many studies assessed whether fucoidan could inhibit the growth of colon cancer
    cells and studied the molecular pathways involved., 'Several studies showed that
    fucoidan exerted anticancer effects, including the suppression of growth ; it
    also decreased metastasis  and inhibited angiogenesis  in a variety of cancer
    cells.', Fucoidan has been reported to inhibit the growth of a wide range of tumor
    cells ., It has also been shown to induce apoptosis in colon cancer HT-29 and
    HCT116 cells in a dose-dependent manner ., Kim et al., revealed that low concentrations
    of fucoidan induced apoptosis of HT-29 and HCT-116 cells in a dose- and time-dependent
    manner., 'However, fucoidan showed a smaller effect on HTC116 cells than on HT-29
    cells.', According to Hyun et al., ", fucoidan was able to induce apoptosis in
    HCT-15 human colon cancer cells at a concentration of 100 \u03BCg/mL.", These
    results showed that the efficacy of fucoidan varied with the type of colon cancer
    cell studied., 'It was reported that fucoidan activated caspases, resulting in
    the induction of apoptosis through both death receptor-mediated and mitochondria-mediated
    apoptotic pathways .', Dactylone is representative of a new group of natural cancer-preventive
    agents ., Its chemical structure is closely related to that of sesquiterpenoids
    extracted from red algae Laurencia spp., 'The effects of dactylone have been studied
    in many cancer cell lines, including human colon cancer HCT116 cells, and the
    molecular mechanism underlying these effects was assessed .', 'Dactylone was able
    to suppress the phenotype expression of various human cancer cell lines and was
    shown to induce G1-S cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in tumor cells; it decreased
    Rb protein phosphorylation at Ser795, Ser780, and Ser807/811 sites, and also inhibited
    the expression of cyclin D3 and cyclin-dependent kinase4 .', 'Other studies revealed
    that inositol hexaphosphate, a dietary constituent found in rice, seems to act
    in a similar manner as dactylone.', 'Indeed, inositol hexaphosphate has also been
    reported to decrease Cdk4 and cyclin D1 protein expression levels in addition
    to the inhibition of Rb phosphorylation at Ser780, Ser807, and Ser811, causing
    G1 arrest and apoptotic death of human cancers .', 'Meroditerpenoids such as plastoquinones,
    chromanols, and chromenes are a class of natural products consisting of a polyprenyl
    chain attached to a hydroquinone ring moiety, and are commonly present in brown
    algae .', Pereira et al., tested six meroditerpenoids isolated from the brown
    algae Stypopodium flabelliforme., 'These meroditerpenoids inhibited cell proliferation
    in five cell lines: human neuroblastoma, rat basophilic leukemia, murine macrophages,
    Chinese hamster fibroblasts, and human colon adenocarcinoma cells.', "Overall,
    the compounds\u2019 activities against all cell lines were efficient.", 'Stypotriol
    triacetate showed the most inhibition of the colon adenocarcinoma cell line, Caco-2,
    followed by epitaondiol monoacetate and epitaondiol.', 'Over their lifetime, marine
    algae accumulate high levels of minerals from seawater .', 'The proliferation
    and differentiation of human colon carcinoma cell lines were assessed in the presence
    of a mineral-rich extract from the red marine alga, Lithothamnion calcareum .',
  This algal extract was as effective as inorganic calcium in both inhibition of colon
    carcinoma cell growth and induction of its differentiation., Both epidemiological
    studies  and interventional studies  in humans have demonstrated that calcium
    has the capacity to reduce polyp formation in the colon., Other studies have found
    that different minerals obtained from marine algae could also contribute to the
    reduction of polyp formation., 'In another study, Aslam et al.', reported that
    a multi-mineral product obtained from marine algae was able to reduce colon polyp
    formation in C57BL/6 mice receiving either a high-fat diet or a low-fat diet .,
  'Based on these results, they suggested that the effects of calcium alone could
    not explain the protective effects of the multi-mineral supplement and that a
    multi-mineral approach to colon polyp chemoprevention may prove to be more efficacious
    than an approach based on the use of calcium alone.', 'Ulva fasciata extract from
    Ulva fasciata Delile, which grows abundantly along costal seashores, was used
    to assess the mechanisms underlying the cytotoxicity of green algae .', The anti-proliferative
    effects of UFE against colon cancer cells involved induction of apoptosis., 'Reactive
    oxygen species have been reported to regulate apoptotic signal transduction and
    induce depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane, leading to increases levels
    of pro-apoptotic molecules in the cytosol .', Rye et al., demonstrated that UFE
    significantly increased ROS generation in HCT116 cells and that antioxidant-mediated
    scavenging of UFE-induced ROS reduced the UFE-mediated cell death., "UFE was able
    to inhibit the growth of HCT116 human colon cancer cells by 50% at a concentration
    of 200 \u03BCg/mL.", 'It induced apoptosis through alteration in Bcl-2 family
    protein expression, increasing mitochondrial membrane permeability, and activation
    of caspase 9 and caspase 3 .', Breast cancer is the leading cause of death among
    women in many countries ., 'Although male breast cancer is less common, a few
    studies have revealed that the incidence has increased over the past 25 years
    .', Scientists have aimed to treat breast cancer without harming the patient by
    exploiting the differences between cancerous and normal cells., Nutritional strategies
    have been applied to study populations with a low incidence of breast cancer.,
  'In Asia, seaweeds have been eaten for at least 5000 years .', These populations
    have a low incidence of breast cancer., Certain brown and red algae are known
    for their anticancer properties ., 'In cells treated with seaweed, apoptosis was
    observed , and the authors speculated that seaweed could be a breast cancer-preventing
    food.', 'Some studies recently evaluated the effect of a brown seaweed methanol
    extract on the proliferation of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines  by
    conducting morphological assessments of apoptosis, caspase assays, and chick chorioallantoic
    membrane assays.', 'These methods were used to determine the morphological alterations
    induced by SMME to evaluate its time-dependent effects on caspases 8, 9, and 3
    by using caspase assays, and also to evaluate the anti-angiogenic effects of SMME
    using the CAM assay.', 'They observed that treatment with SMME significantly decreased
    angiogenesis, leading them to speculate that SMME could decrease cancer cell proliferation
    and increase apoptosis of human breast cancer cells in a time- and dose-dependent
    manner.', 'Fucoidan was reported to enhance the activity of natural killer cells,
    which have anticancer activity .', The effects of crude fucoidan extracted from
    Fucus vesiculosus on the growth of breast cancer have been determined in vitro
    and in vivo ., 'Crude fucoidan significantly reduced the number of viable 4T1
    cells, enhanced apoptosis, and down-regulated the expression of vascular endothelial
    growth factor.', 'The mechanisms thought to be responsible for these fucoidan-mediated
    effects are inhibition of the expression of Bcl-2, survivin, extracellular signal-regulated
    kinases, and VEGF, and an increase in caspase-3 activation.', 'A sterol fraction
    extract of Porphyra dentata, an edible red alga used as a folk medicine in Asia,
    was evaluated for its effects on myeloid derived suppressor cells in 4T1 cancer
    cells .', "Previous findings indicated that phytosterols such as \u03B2-sitosterol,
    either alone or in combination with campesterol, may offer protection from various
    tumors .", MDSCs play an important role in tumorigenesis ., "The authors associated
    the anticancer activity of Porphyra dentata with the presence of \u03B2-sitosterol
    and campesterol, which reduced the suppressive activity of MDSCs and consequently
    decreased tumor size.", 'These two mechanisms might affect phytosterol-related
    downregulation of the suppressive activity of MDSCs, which is related to their
    ROS accumulation and arginase activity.', 'Many studies have explored the use
    of seaweed in the fight against several diseases, including colorectal and breast
    cancers.', Various therapeutic compounds from seaweed are able to induce apoptosis
    through different pathways and molecular mechanisms., 'Several studies indicated
    that fucoidan was able to induce apoptosis, inhibit angiogenesis, and suppress
    lung metastasis of breast cancer in vitro and in vivo .', 'Furthermore, fucoidan
    inhibited growth and induced apoptosis of HT-29 colon cancer cells .', Laminarin
    induced apoptosis through the Fas and IGF-IR signaling pathways and through the
    intrinsic apoptotic and ErbB pathways ., This review highlights the importance
    of seaweed in the fight against colorectal and breast cancer., 'This research
    was supported by the KRIBB Research Initiative Program, and the Cooperative Research
    Program for Agriculture Science and Technology Development, Rural Development
    Administration and Republic of Korea.', 'Ghislain Moussavou, Dong Hoon Kwak, and
