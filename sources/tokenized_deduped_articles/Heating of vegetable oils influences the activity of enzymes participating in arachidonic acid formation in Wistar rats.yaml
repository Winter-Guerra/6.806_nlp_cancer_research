[Dietary intake of lipids and their fatty acids profile influence many aspects of
    health., 'Thermal processing changes the properties of edible oils and can also
    modify their metabolism, e.g.', eicosanoids formation., 'The aim of our study
    was to verify whether the activity of desaturases can be modified by lipids intake,
    especially by the fatty acids content.', 'The experimental diets contained rapeseed
    oil, sunflower oil and olive oil, both unheated and heated, influences the fatty
    acids composition in serum and the activity of enzymes participating in arachidonic
    acid formation.', 'The activity of desaturases were determined by measuring the
    amounts of AA formed in vitro, derived from linoleic acid as determined in liver
    microsomes of Wistar rats.', "In addition, the indices of \xE2\x88\x866-desaturase
    and \xE2\x88\x865-desaturase have been determined.", To realize this aim the method
    of high performance liquid chromatography has been used with UV/VIS detection.,
  "Diet supplementation with the oils rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids affects
    the fatty acids profile in blood serum and the activity of \xCE\x946\\- and \xCE\x945-desaturases
    in rat liver microsomes, the above activities being dependent on the kind of oil
    applied.", 'Diet supplementation with heated oils has been found to increase the
    amount of AA produced in hepatic microsomes, and in the case of RAP and SUN, it
    has also increased D6D activity.']
