['Objective: This research quantified the phytochemical profile, antioxidant activities
    and cytotoxicity of Thai pigmented rice.', 'Method: Acidified ethanol extracts
    from seeds of twelve Thai pigmented rice cultivars were investigated for their
    content of bioactive compounds, antioxidant activities, and cytotoxicity on human
    promyelocytic leukemia cells.', 'Results: Black rice cultivars and red rice cultivars
    showed total phenolic content.', The predominant phenolic pigments were anthocyanins
    for black rice and procyanidins for red rice., "Antioxidant activity ranged within
    0.06 \u2013 1.36 mg AAE/mL for FRAP, IC50 0.10 \u2013 1.12 mg/mL for DPPH and
    7.57 \u2013 40.48 % for TBARS.", 'Red rice tended to exhibit higher antioxidant
    activities than black rice in the FRAP assay, but there were no significant differences
    between rice colors in the DPPH and TBARS assays.', Pigmented rice extracts containing
    the highest total phenolic content were selected to assess their cytotoxicity
    on human promyelocytic leukemia cells., 'Black rice showed higher cytotoxicity,
    corresponding with the lower IC50 compared to red rice.', 'Conclusion: The results
    revealed that Thai pigmented rice is a natural antioxidant source with potential
    for use as an active ingredient in cosmetics, functional food and pharmaceuticals.']
