[Aromatase or cytochrome P450 enzyme catalyzes the rate-determining reaction in estrogen
    synthesis., Inhibiting aromatase is a major strategy in treating breast cancer
    patients., 'However, suppression on the transcriptional activity may be equally
    important in controlling aromatase.', Dietary flavones and flavonones have been
    previously demonstrated to be the most potent aromatase-inhibitory flavonoids.,
  In the present study we examined their effects on the transcription regulation of
    CYP19 in MCF-7 cells., Real-time PCR results indicated that luteolin suppressed
    CYP19 mRNA expression while hesperetin increased it., 'Reporter gene assays were
    employed to look into the transactivity of CYP19 driven by promoters I.3 and II,
    and the result was consistent with the observation in mRNA expression.', Further
    investigation using truncation reporter gene and electrophoretic mobility shift
    assays suggested that luteolin and hesperetin differentially influenced AP-1-
    and C/EBP-binding on the CYP19 promoter., Western blot analysis indicated that
    signaling transduction pathways involving JNK and ERK could be the underlying
    mechanisms for their actions., The present study showed that dietary flavones
    and flavonones might differentially regulate aromatase transcription in breast
    cells in addition to the inhibition at the enzyme level.]
