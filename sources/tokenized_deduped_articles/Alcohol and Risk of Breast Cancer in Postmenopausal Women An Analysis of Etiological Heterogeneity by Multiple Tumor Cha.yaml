[Alcohol consumption is an established risk factor for breast cancer., Whether associations
    vary by specific tumor characteristics independent of other characteristics is
    unclear., 'We evaluated the association between alcohol consumption and breast
    cancer risk in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial
    cohort.', Hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for subtypes defined by histological
    type and estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor status were calculated with standard
    Cox models., A novel 2-stage Cox model assessed heterogeneity in risk for individual
    tumor characteristics while adjusting for others., "Significant trends across
    categories of alcohol consumption were observed, with hazard ratios for those
    consuming 7 or more drinks per week versus never drinkers as follows: for estrogen
    receptor\u2013positive cancer, 1.48: 1.19, 1.83); for progesterone receptor\u2013positive
    cancer, 1.64; for ER+/PR+ cancer, 1.63; and for mixed ductal/lobular cancer, 2.51.",
  'For ER+ and PR+ cancers, trends were significant for ductal and mixed ductal/lobular
    types.', PR status explained the positive association with ER status., Alcohol
    consumption was not associated with all breast cancer subtypes., 'Future work
    should emphasize large collaborative studies, precise definition of subtypes,
    and adjustment for correlated tumor characteristics.']
