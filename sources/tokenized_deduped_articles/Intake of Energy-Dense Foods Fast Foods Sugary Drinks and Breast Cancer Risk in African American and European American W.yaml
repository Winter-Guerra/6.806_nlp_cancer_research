['Limiting energy-dense foods, fast foods, and sugary drinks that promote weight gain
    is a cancer prevention recommendation, but no studies have evaluated intake in
    relation to breast cancer risk in African American women.', 'In a case-control
    study with 1692 AA women and 1456 European American women, odds ratios and 95%
    confidence intervals for risk were computed, stratifying for menopausal and estrogen
    receptor status.', 'Among postmenopausal EA women, breast cancer risk was associated
    with frequent consumption of energy-dense foods, fast foods, and sugary drinks.',
  Elevated risk of ER+ tumors in EA women was associated with energy-dense and fast
    foods., 'Among AA women, frequent fast food consumption was related to premenopausal
    breast cancer risk, and with ER+ tumors.', 'Energy adjustment attenuated risk
    estimates in AA women, while strengthening them among EA women.', 'Frequent consumption
    of energy-dense and fast foods that have poor nutritive value appeared to increase
    breast cancer risk in AA and EA women, with differences by menopausal status and
    ER status.']
