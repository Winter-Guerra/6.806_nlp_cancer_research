['Over the last few decades, polyunsaturated fatty acid, especially n-6 PUFA, and
    monounsaturated fatty acid content in Western diets has increased manyfold.',
  Such a dietary shift also parallels rising sedentary behavior and diabetes in the
    Western world., We queried if a shift in dietary fats could be linked to physical
    inactivity and insulin insensitivity in mice., 'Eight-week old female C57/Bl6
    mice were fed either high-fat diets  or chow for 6 weeks, followed by estimation
    of spontaneous locomotor activity, body composition and in vivo metabolic outcomes.',
  'Although lean mass and resting energy expenditure stayed similar in both OO- and
    CO-fed mice, only CO-fed mice demonstrated reduced spontaneous locomotor activity.',
  'Such depressed activity in CO-fed mice was accompanied by a lower respiratory ratio,
    hyperinsulinemia and impaired glucose disposal following intraperitoneal glucose
    tolerance and insulin tolerance tests compared to OO-fed mice.', 'Unlike the liver,
    where both HF diets increased expression of fat oxidation genes like PPARs, the
    skeletal muscle of CO-fed mice failed to up-regulate such genes, thereby supporting
    the metabolic insufficiencies observed in these mice.', 'In summary, this study
    demonstrates a specific contribution of n-6 PUFA-rich oils like CO to the loss
    of spontaneous physical activity and insulin sensitivity in mice.', 'If these
    data hold true for humans, this study could provide a novel link between recent
    increases in dietary n-6 PUFA to sedentary behavior and the development of insulin
    resistance in the Western world.']
