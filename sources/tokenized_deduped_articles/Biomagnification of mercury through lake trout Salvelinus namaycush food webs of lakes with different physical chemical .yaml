['Mercury biomagnification in aquatic ecosystems remains a concern because this pollutant
    is known to affect the health of fish-eating wildlife and humans, and the fish
    themselves.', 'The "rate" of mercury biomagnification is being assessed more frequently
    using stable nitrogen isotope ratios, a measure of relative trophic position of
    biota within a food web.', "Within food webs and across diverse systems, log-transformed
    Hg concentrations are significantly and positively related to \xCE\xB415N and
    the slopes of these models vary from one study to another for reasons that are
    not yet understood.", Here we compared the rates of Hg biomagnification in 14
    lake trout lakes from three provinces in Canada to understand whether any characteristics
    of the ecosystems explained this among-system variability., 'Several fish species,
    zooplankton and benthic invertebrates were collected from these lakes and analyzed
    for total Hg, methyl Hg and stable isotopes.', 'Mercury biomagnification rates
    varied significantly across systems and were higher for food webs of larger, higher
    nutrient lakes.', 'However, the slopes were not predictive of among-lake differences
    in Hg in the lake trout.', 'Results indicate that among-system differences in
    the rates of Hg biomagnification seen in the literature may be due, in part, to
    differences in ecosystem characteristics although the mechanisms for this variability
    are not yet understood.']
