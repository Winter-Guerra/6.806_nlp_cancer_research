[Cancer may not be completely the result of novel or inherited genetic mutations but
    may in fact be a largely preventable disease., "Researchers have identified biochemicals,
    including n\u20133 fatty acids, tocopherols, \u03B2-sitosterol, and pedunculagin,
    that are found in walnuts and that have cancer-prevention properties.", "Mouse
    studies in which walnuts were added to the diet have shown the following compared
    with the control diet: 1) the walnut-containing diet inhibited the growth rate
    of human breast cancers implanted in nude mice by \u223C80%; 2) the walnut-containing
    diet reduced the number of mammary gland tumors by \u223C60% in a transgenic mouse
    model; 3) the reduction in mammary gland tumors was greater with whole walnuts
    than with a diet containing the same amount of n\u20133 fatty acids, supporting
    the idea that multiple components in walnuts additively or synergistically contribute
    to cancer suppression; and 4) walnuts slowed the growth of prostate, colon, and
    renal cancers by antiproliferative and antiangiogenic mechanisms.", Cell studies
    have aided in the identification of the active components in walnuts and of their
    mechanisms of action., This review summarizes these studies and presents the notion
    that walnuts may be included as a cancer-preventive choice in a healthy diet.]
