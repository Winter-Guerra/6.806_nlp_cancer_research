    a significant decrease in the cell viability after 24, 48 and 72 h. Similarly,

    intervals, a number of thus affected cells decreased and the remaining cells started
    to behave actively including mitoses.', 'At the end of the experiment, the treated

    the cytotoxic effects persisted, but the cells started to proliferate again and
    their viability increased.', "Since DNA is the main target of most cytotoxic anticancer
    drugs, we focused on the induction of DNA damage in MCF-7 cells after \u03B1-tomatine
    treatment.", 'To assess DNA damage in MCF-7 cells, we used the alkaline and neutral
    version of the comet assay.', The alkaline version is employed for the quantification
    of SSBs of DNA., "The concentrations of \u03B1-tomatine used did not cause any
    significant SSBs after 4 h compared with H2O2-treated MCF-7 cells.", The neutral
    version specifically determines DSBs of DNA., "The same concentrations of \u03B1-tomatine,
    as they were used in the alkaline version of the comet assay, did not cause any
    significant DSBs after 4 h of treatment in comparison with irradiated cells.",

    on threonine 68 of Chk2 occurred in comparison with the positive control group.",
  "Although our results indicate no \u03B1-tomatine-induced DNA damage in MCF-7 cells,
    we elucidated whether apoptosis is induced in the cells exposed to \u03B1-tomatine
    by another triggering mechanism.", "Initially, we evaluated changes in the levels
    of proteins p53, p53 phosphorylated on serine 15 and p21WAF1/CIP1 in \u03B1-tomatine-treated
    MCF-7 cells after 4 and 24 h of incubation.", No changes in the levels of these

    \u03B1-tomatine treatment for 24 and 72 h. As shown in Fig.", "3C, the concentrations
    of \u03B1-tomatine used caused no specific apoptotic sub-G1 peak after 24 and
    72 h of treatment.", "To confirm our theory that \u03B1-tomatine did not cause
    apoptosis in MCF-7 cells, we measured the loss of ATP in \u03B1-tomatine-treated
    cells after 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, 48 and 72 h. Fig.", "3D demonstrates a significant
    decrease, in comparison to untreated cells, in the content of ATP in cells treated

    h and with 6 \u03BCM of \u03B1-tomatine at all treatment intervals between 6 and
    72 h. Moreover, to gain further insight into the mechanism of cell death caused
    by \u03B1-tomatine, transmission electron microscopy of MCF-7 cells treated with
    6 \u03BCM of \u03B1-tomatine was carried out.", 'The treated cells showed swelling
    and disintegration of both nuclear and plasma membranes, characteristic of a rapid
    necrosis, but no typical morphologic signs of apoptosis, such as cell shrinkage,
    nuclear fragmentation, chromatin condensation, nuclear and cytoplasmic blebbing
    and the formation of apoptotic bodies.', "Previous results indicated that \u03B1-tomatine
    at concentrations of 6 and 9 \u03BCM caused a cytotoxic effect in MCF-7 cells
    during the first 24 h, but after 48 and 72 h of incubation cell proliferation
    and viability began to increase.", "Thus, we monitored the concentration of \u03B1-tomatine
    in the medium during the incubation with cells in order to determine whether it
    changes with time.", "We detected a decrease in the level of \u03B1-tomatine from
    the initial value of 2.49 to 1.56 \u03BCM after 4 h, to 0.90 \u03BCM after 24
    h, to 0.73 \u03BCM after 48 h, and to 0.75 \u03BCM after 72 h.\n\nAs cholesterol
    is known to form an insoluble precipitate with \u03B1-tomatine, its effect in
    the incubation media was evaluated.", "Initially, the stability of 3 \u03BCM of
    \u03B1-tomatine in PBS buffer during the 72 h of incubation was confirmed.", 'Subsequently,
    the effect of cholesterol was tested.', 'Since cholesterol is insoluble in aqueous
    solutions, albumin was used as a carrier.', "When fetal calf serum was replaced
    by pure albumin in the standard incubation medium, a decrease in \u03B1-tomatine
    in the cell-free medium was not observed during the incubation time.", "By contrast,
    &gt;50% of \u03B1-tomatine was lost during the first 4 h of incubation when albumin
    containing the same concentration of cholesterol as the fetal calf serum was used.",
  "Therefore, interaction of \u03B1-tomatine with cholesterol appears to be the main
    reason for the decrease in \u03B1-tomatine in the medium during incubation, at
    least in the absence of cells.", "To support this hypothesis, we also carried
    out tests to exclude the possible metabolism of \u03B1-tomatine caused by MCF-7
    cells or enzymes present in the fetal calf serum added to an incubation medium.",
  "The incubation of 3 \u03BCM of \u03B1-tomatine in the standard incubation medium
    with and without MCF-7 cells led to a 60\u201370% loss of \u03B1-tomatine during
    the first 24 h. A comparable decrease in \u03B1-tomatine was observed when inactivated
    serum was added to the medium.", 'Thus, the decrease is not due to biotransformation
    by plasma enzymes.', 'To screen the potential biotransformation by MCF-7 cells,
    a standard incubation medium with native fetal calf serum was used.', "Based on
    the \u03B1-tomatine structure, we anticipated that its biotransformation can proceed
    by deglycosidation or by oxidation of the aglycone.", "As these deglycosidated
    derivatives, with the exception of tomatidine, are not available on the market,
    acid hydrolysis of \u03B1-tomatine was carried out in order to get a reaction
    mixture containing compounds derived from \u03B1-tomatine by consecutive loss
    of sugar units.", Hydrolysis products found in the reaction mixture are presented
    in Fig., 5B., Representative chromatograms for each compound were extracted from
    full scan data and the retention times and masses are presented in Table I., "Retention
    times and m/z of pseudomolecular ions + of \u03B1-tomatine hydrolysis products.",
  "Subsequently, samples of the incubation media and MCF-7 cell pellets after 4, 24,
    48 and 72 h of incubation with 3 \u03BCM of \u03B1-tomatine were obtained and
    targeted metabolic screening for deglycosidated metabolites was carried out.",
  Representative chromatograms for metabolites possibly arising from deglycosidation
    were extracted from mass spectrometric data and compared with chromatograms of
    derivatives obtained by hydrolysis., Target metabolites were not found either
    in the incubation media or in the cell pellet., "With this experiment, we proved
    that during incubation with an MCF-7 cell line, \u03B1-tomatine is not subjected
    to deglycosidation by biotransformation or by chemical decomposition.", "Samples
    were also tested for the presence of oxidative biotransformation products of \u03B1-tomatine
    and tomatidine.", 'Since chemical standards of these metabolites are not available
    and chemical synthesis is problematic, the mass spectrometric data obtained was
    only inspected for masses of suspected mono-hydroxy, di-hydroxy or N-oxide derivatives.',
  None of these suspected metabolites were found in the samples., "The mechanism of
    the cytotoxic action of \u03B1-tomatine has been studied intensively; nevertheless,
    the existing results differ significantly.", "In mouse EL4 lymphoma cells, \u03B1-tomatine
    at the concentration of 8 \u03BCM induces apoptosis with changes in the cell cycle
    distribution of these cells.", "In human prostatic adenocarcinoma PC-3 cells,
    a marked increase of apoptotic cells in sub-G1 phase was observed after treatment
    with 2 \u03BCM of \u03B1-tomatine for 24 h. The induction of apoptosis is closely
    related to the activation of cysteine proteases called caspases.", "In PC-3 cells,
    the activation of caspase-3, -8 and -9 in 2 \u03BCM of \u03B1-tomatine-treated
    cells was demonstrated.", "Contrary to these results, the induction of programmed
    cell death with no changes in caspase-3, -6, -7, -8 and -9 activity and with no
    changes in cell cycle distribution was demonstrated in \u03B1-tomatine-treated
    human leukemic cells HL60 and K562 as well as MOLT-4.", 'Similarly, we demonstrated
    that caspase-8 and -9 are not activated.', "Our results indicate no changes in
    cell cycle distribution, no apoptotic sub-G1 peak in MCF-7 cells and no morphological
    signs of apoptosis after treatment with \u03B1-tomatine.", "\u03B1-Tomatine at
    the concentrations of 1\u20139 \u03BCM after 4 h induced neither SSBs nor DSBs
    detectable by comet assay in MCF-7 cells.", 'Moreover, the activation of Chk2
    related to DNA damage was not detected.', 'The tumor-suppressor phosphoprotein
    p53 plays a significant role in preventing inappropriate cell proliferation and
    maintaining genome integrity in response to genotoxic stress, resulting in cell-cycle
    arrest, DNA repair, apoptosis or senescence.', "Our experimental data show no
    changes in the level of p53 and p53 phosphorylated on serine 15 in MCF-7 cells
    after 4 and 24 h of \u03B1-tomatine treatment.", The levels of the cyclin-dependent
    kinase inhibitor p21WAF1/CIP1 also remained unchanged., Apoptosis is a process
    highly dependent on the content of intracellular ATP; there is an evident physiological
    difference in cells undergoing apoptosis or necrosis., "We demonstrated a loss
    of ATP in \u03B1-tomatine-treated cells after 72 h, which supports the results
    of this study discussed above.", "A possible explanation of the cytotoxic mechanism
    could be the fact that cholesterol in biological membranes serves as a target
    for \u03B1-tomatine.", "A number of studies have indicated that \u03B1-tomatine
    inhibits the growth of various human cancer cell lines at low \u03BCM concentrations
    within 1\u201348 h of treatment.", "Our results showed a cytotoxic effect of \u03B1-tomatine
    at slightly higher concentrations than in the previous studies.", "We demonstrated
    that 6 and 9 \u03BCM of \u03B1-tomatine caused an inhibition of proliferation
    and a decrease in viability after 24 h in MCF-7 cells.", "However, after 48 and
    72 h of \u03B1-tomatine treatment, a recovery of these cells occurred.", "Our
    study also revealed a transient increase and activation of check-point kinase
    1 4 h after \u03B1-tomatine application, which corresponds with the inhibition
    of proliferation.", These changes in the levels of proteins disappeared after
    24 h of incubation - an effect that corresponds with cell recovery., Chk1 is essential
    for cell viability and proliferation and for maintaining DNA integrity., 'Although
    it is active even in unperturbed cell cycles, it is further activated in response
    to DNA damage or stalled replication fork.', We investigated why the cells recovered
    after 24 h of incubation., "In the course of that, we observed a decrease in the
    levels of \u03B1-tomatine solved in the media throughout the incubation.", "As
    this phenomenon occurred only when cholesterol was present in the media, the formation
    of an insoluble \u03B1-tomatine cholesterol complex should be the main reason.",
  "It was reported that \u03B1-tomatine is, in contrast to the related saponins, not
    interface seeking.", "The accumulation of \u03B1-tomatine at the water-air interface
    should therefore not be the cause of its potential disappearing from the solution.",
  "Regarding biotransformation, fungal pathogens of tomato produce tomatinase enzymes
    which hydrolyze \u03B1-tomatine by removing the complete sugar moiety or partial
    sugars.", Only aglycone released is susceptible to hydroxylation by cytochrome
    P-450., "Since the removal of even a single monosaccharide from the sugar moiety
    reduces the membranolytic activity of \u03B1-tomatine substantially, deglycosylation
    serves as a resistance mechanism of fungal pathogens.", "Our findings of no putative
    metabolites of \u03B1-tomatine, neither in the medium nor in cell pellets, are
    consistent with the current knowledge which suggests that mammalian cells do not
    metabolize \u03B1-tomatine.", "Cholesterol in the membranes of MCF-7 cells probably
    served as a target for \u03B1-tomatine as well.", "The release of the cytosolic
    enzyme LDH which occurred especially at concentrations of \u03B1-tomatine 6 and
    9 \u03BCM, is a marker of membrane integrity loss typical for early necrosis and
    only the late stage of apoptosis.", 'The absence of any characteristic features
    of apoptosis, the morphological signs as well as the ATP depletion observed, rather
    indicate necrotic cell death.', "Although the rupture of membranes occurs in necrosis
    mediated by different mechanisms, the binding of \u03B1-tomatine to membrane cholesterol
    and the consequent membrane disruption may have had a triggering effect in the
    present study.", Membrane disintegration by several other agents was shown to
    induce necrosis., "Steroidal glycoalkaloids form complexes with free 3\u03B2-hydroxy
    sterols, such as cholesterol, present in the outer leaflet of the plasma and outer
    mitochondrial membranes of animal cells.", 'A network of these complexes undergoes
    a lateral aggregation through sugar-sugar interactions between the sugar moieties,
    causing a rearrangement and subsequent loss of the barrier function.', "\u03B1-Tomatine
    has the strongest membrane-disruptive effect of all Solanum glycoalkaloids studied
    thus far.", "In conclusion, our results show that a single application of \u03B1-tomatine
    has an antiproliferative effect on cancer cells within 24 h of incubation, but
    then the cells recover.", "Since \u03B1-tomatine is not biotransformed in the
    MCF-7 cell line via deglycosidation or oxidation during 72 h but the concentration
    of \u03B1-tomatine significantly decreases in solutions and media containing cholesterol,
    this effect is most probably related to the ability of \u03B1-tomatine to bind
    with cholesterol present in the culture medium.", "Our study is the first to describe
    this phenomenon, which should be taken into consideration when interpreting results
    from an in vitro assay with \u03B1-tomatine.", "\u03B1-Tomatine does not induce
    DNA damage or the activation of caspases; it does not change the levels of proteins
    p53 and p21 in the MCF-7 cell line but rather causes a decrease in the cellular
    ATP.", "These facts, along with the morphological changes observed, suggest that
    the decrease in viability of MCF-7 cells by \u03B1-tomatine is not due to apoptosis
    induction.", A probable mechanism involved in the cytotoxicity is the membrane-disruptive
    effect due to its binding with membrane cholesterol., The authors thank Ms. Nadezda
