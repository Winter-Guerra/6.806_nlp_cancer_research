['Piperine, an alkaloid from black pepper, is reported to have anticancer activities.',
  'In this study, we investigated the effect of piperine on the growth and motility
    of triple-negative breast cancer cells.', 'Piperine inhibited the in vitro growth
    of TNBC cells, as well as hormone-dependent breast cancer cells, without affecting
    normal mammary epithelial cell growth.', Exposure to piperine decreased the percentage
    of TNBC cells in the G2 phase of the cell cycle., 'In addition, G1- and G2-associated
    protein expression was decreased and p21Waf1/Cip1 expression was increased in
    piperine-treated TNBC cells.', Piperine also inhibited survival-promoting Akt
    activation in TNBC cells and caused caspase-dependent apoptosis via the mitochondrial
    pathway., "Interestingly, combined treatment with piperine and \xCE\xB3 radiation
    was more cytotoxic for TNBC cells than \xCE\xB3 radiation alone.", 'The in vitro
    migration of piperine-treated TNBC cells was impaired and expression of matrix
    metalloproteinase-2 and -9 mRNA was decreased, suggesting an antimetastatic effect
    by piperine.', 'Finally, intratumoral administration of piperine inhibited the
    growth of TNBC xenografts in immune-deficient mice.', 'Taken together, these findings
    suggest that piperine may be useful in the treatment of TNBC.']
