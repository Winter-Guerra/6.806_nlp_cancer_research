[Epidemiologic studies repeatedly have shown chemopreventive effects of cruciferous
    vegetables., Indole-3-carbinol and its metabolite diindolylmethane were identified
    in these plants as active ingredients and theirs anti-tumor activities were confirmed
    in multiple in vitro and in vivo experiments., 'Here, we demonstrate that DIM
    is a selective and potent inhibitor of cancer stem cells.', 'In several cancer
    cell lines, DIM inhibited tumor sphere formation at the concentrations 30-300
    times lower than concentrations required for growth inhibition of parental cells
    cultured as adherent culture.', 'We also found that treatment with DIM overcomes
    chemoresistance of CSCs to cytotoxics, such as paclitaxel, doxorubicin, and SN-38.',
  Pre-treatment of tumor spheres with DIM before implantation to mice significantly
    retarded the growth of primary tumors compared to tumors formed by untreated tumor
    spheres., The concentrations of DIM required to suppress CSCs formation are in
    the close range to those achievable in human plasma after oral dosing of the compound.,
  'Therefore, DIM can potentially be used in cancer patients, either alone, or in
    combinations with existing drugs.']
