[Piperlongumine has been shown to selectively induce apoptotic cell death in cancer
    cells via reactive oxygen species accumulation., 'In this study, we characterized
    a molecular mechanism for PL-induced cell death.', 'Cell viability and cell death
    were assessed by MTT assay and Annexin V-FITC/PI staining, respectively.', ROS
    generation was measured using the H2DCFDA., Small interfering RNA was used for
    suppressing gene expression., 'The mRNA and protein expression were analyzed by
    RT-PCR and Western blot analysis, respectively.', 'We found that PL promotes C/EBP
    homologous protein induction, which leads to the up-regulation of its targets
    Bim and DR5.', 'Pretreatment with the ROS scavenger N-acetyl-cysteine abolishes
    the PL-induced up-regulation of CHOP and its target genes, suggesting an essential
    role for ROS in PL-induced CHOP activation.', 'The down-regulation of CHOP or
    Bim with siRNA efficiently attenuates PL-induced cell death, suggesting a critical
    role for CHOP in this cell death.', 'Furthermore, PL potentiates TRAIL-induced
    cytotoxicity in breast cancer cells by upregulating DR5, as DR5 knockdown abolished
    the sensitizing effect of PL on TRAIL responses.', 'Overall, our data suggest
    a new mechanism for the PL-induced cell death in which ROS mediates CHOP activation,
    and combination treatment with PL and TRAIL could be a potential strategy for
    breast cancer therapy.', Piperlongumine is a natural alkaloid of the long pepper
    that can selectively kill cancer cells but not normal cells., A proposed mechanism
    by which PL induces cancer-selective cell death is by elevating reactive oxygen
    species levels., 'PL directly binds to and inhibits the antioxidant enzyme glutathione
    S-transferase pi 1, resulting in elevated levels of ROS and subsequent cancer-selective
    cell death.', 'ROS are by-products of normal cellular metabolism and play vital
    roles in stimulating signaling pathways, such as intracellular signal transduction,
    metabolism, proliferation, and apoptosis.', Cancer cells have increased ROS compared
    with normal cells due to the highly metabolic nature of these cells., 'Thus, the
    high ROS content in cancer cells renders them more susceptible to cell death induced
    by oxidative stress.', 'As a result, modulating ROS levels have been proposed
    as a therapeutic strategy to selectively target the destruction of cancer cells.',
  'C/EBP homologous protein/growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible gene 153 are a
    basic leucine zipper transcription factor that is present at very low levels under
    normal conditions but is robustly expressed by a variety of cellular stresses,
    such as genotoxic stress, nutrient depletion, or ER stress.', 'CHOP functions
    as a transcription factor that regulates the expression of proapoptotic Bcl-2
    family genes, which in turn elicit mitochondrial cell death.', Death receptors
    are members of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family and are also induced
    by CHOP by various agents., 'TRAIL induces apoptosis by interacting with DR4 and
    DR5, leading to the formation of the death-inducing signal complex with the binding
    of caspase-8.', TRAIL induces cell death in various cancer cells but not has little
    or no effect on most normal cells., Several reports have shown that DR5 plays
    a crucial role in sensitizing tumor cells to apoptosis induced by TRAIL and chemotherapeutic
    agents., Understanding the regulatory mechanism of DR5 is an important issue in
    cancer therapy using combinations of TRAIL and various sensitizing agents., 'In
    the present study, we elucidated for the first time that PL induces cell death
    through ROS-mediated CHOP up-regulation.', 'Furthermore, PL sensitized breast
    cancer cells to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis mediated by CHOP-dependent DR5 up-regulation,

    was determined by MTT assays.', As shown in Fig., "1a, PL decreased the viability
    of breast cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner but was not toxic toward normal

    To investigate the role of CHOP in PL-induced cell death, its expression was silenced
    with specific siRNA, followed by PL treatment in both MCF7 and BT474 cells.',
  Knockdown of CHOP significantly attenuated the cell cytotoxicity due to PL treatment.,
  These data suggest that the up-regulation of CHOP is required for cell death induced
    by PL downstream of ROS production., 'Next, we investigated the downstream regulatory
    mechanism(s) of PL-induced CHOP activation.', 'We analyzed CHOP target genes,
    including Bim, DR4, and DR5, by RT-PCR.', 'We observed that Bim and DR5 mRNA expression
    increased in a dose-dependent manner in cells treated with PL, and pretreatment
    with NAC blocked Bim and DR5 induction by PL.', 'Knockdown of CHOP by siRNA reduced
    the Bim and DR5 expression induced by PL, suggesting that CHOP is responsible
    for Bim and DR5 induction by PL.', 'Next, we investigated the role of Bim in PL-induced
    cell death in BT474 breast cancer cells.', Silencing of Bim with siRNA significantly
    suppressed the cell cytotoxicity induced by PL., These results strongly suggest
    that Bim up-regulation by PL is dependent on CHOP and is required for the induction
    of cell death in breast cancer cells., PL leads to cell death via CHOP-mediated

    Because TRAIL triggers apoptosis upon binding to two transmembrane agonistic receptors,
    we investigated whether PL potentiated TRAIL-induced cell death through the modulation
    of DR5 expression.', As shown in Fig., '5a, markedly increased cell death was
    observed in MCF7 and BT474 breast cancer cells treated with PL and TRAIL, whereas
    TRAIL alone did not induce cell death.', PARP cleavage was also significantly
    increased in the cells treated with PL and TRAIL., 'To verify the effects of DR5
    with combined PL and TRAIL treatment, its expression was silenced with specific
    siRNA, followed by PL/TRAIL treatment in MCF7 and BT474 cells.', As shown in Fig.,
  '5c and d, DR5 siRNA considerably reduced DR5 mRNA expression and attenuated the
    cell cytotoxicity induced by treatment with PL/TRAIL.', These results indicate
    that PL could potentiate the TRAIL-induced cell death in breast cancer cells and
    that its possible mechanism is due to the PL-induced up-regulation of DR5 mediated
    by CHOP., PL sensitized TRAIL-mediated cell death mediated by DR5 up-regulation.,

    PL has been shown to selectively induce apoptotic cell death in cancer cells via
    accumulation of ROS.', 'However, little is known about the possible molecular
    mechanisms by which PL induces cell death.', 'In the present study, we demonstrated
    that PL-induced cell death by CHOP-dependent Bim activation induced by ROS production
    in breast cancer cells.', 'In addition, we found that PL potentiated TRAIL-induced
    cell death through CHOP-dependent DR5 up-regulation.', Cancer cells are depend
    more on elevated ROS levels and a highly functional anti-oxidant system than normal
    cells and are thus more vulnerable to agents that impair antioxidant capacity
    or induce further oxidative stress levels., 'A growing body of data suggests that
    ROS are known mediators of intracellular signaling cascades, which trigger a series
    of mitochondrial-associated events including apoptotic cell death.', 'Consistent
    with a previous report, our results showed that PL induced ROS generation and
    was responsible for induction of cell death in breast cancer cells, whereas ROS
    generation was not induced in normal breast cells.', 'By pretreating cells with
    NAC, we found that ROS are essential for the PL-induced apoptosis of breast cancer
    cells.', The overexpression of CHOP has been reported to lead to cell cycle arrest
    and/or apoptotic cell death., 'We found that PL-induced CHOP activation was markedly
    suppressed by NAC treatment, suggesting that CHOP activation induced by PL is
    required for ROS.', 'CHOP knockdown by siRNA effectively reduced PL-induced cell
    death, confirming that CHOP activation plays an important role in PL-induced cell
    death.', Our findings are similar to a previous study showing that CHOP is involved
    in ROS-mediated cell death in human acute promyelocytic leukemia and that CHOP
    silencing reduces sodium selenite-induced apoptotic cell death., 'To verify that
    elevated CHOP expression induced by PL is associated with increased transcriptional
    activity, we analyzed CHOP target genes by RT-PCR.', 'Previous studies have reported
    that proapoptotic BH3-only proteins, such as Bim or puma, are required for CHOP-induced
    cell death.', 'However, no changes in puma levels were observed in the cells subjected
    to PL treatment.', CHOP silencing inhibited PL-induced Bim mRNA levels and cell
    death., 'Additionally, Bim knockdown suppressed cell death induced by PL.', These
    results suggest that CHOP-dependent Bim up-regulation plays a role in breast cancer
    cell death induced by PL., The induction of death receptors has been shown to
    be mediated by CHOP induction., Our results showed that CHOP silencing by siRNA
    effectively blocked the effect of PL on the DR5 induction and cell death., 'Therefore,
    our data showed that PL induced a CHOP-dependent up-regulation of DR5 but not
    DR4, which potentiates TRAIL-induced cell death in breast cancer cells.', 'Overall,
    this study provides a new mechanism for PL-induced cell death that is mediated
    by ROS-dependent CHOP/Bim activation.', 'Furthermore, PL potentiates breast cancer
    cells to TRAIL through CHOP-mediated DR5 up-regulation.', These results suggest
    that PL has great potential as a therapeutic approach for breast cancer and provide
    a rational for the combination therapy of PL and TRAIL., 'This research was supported
