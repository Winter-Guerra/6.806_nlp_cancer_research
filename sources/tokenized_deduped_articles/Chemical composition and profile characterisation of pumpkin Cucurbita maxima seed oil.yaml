[Seeds of a Tunisian variety of pumpkin were analysed for their main chemical composition
    and for their oil properties., 'Expressed on dry weight basis, seed moisture was
    8.46%, whereas contents of proteins, fibre, ash, fat, and total sugars established
    at 33.92%, 3.97%, 21.97%, 31.57%, and 0.11% respectively.', 'Gas chromatography
    revealed that the major fatty acids were oleic, linoleic, and palmitic acids.',
  "Seed oil was also found to be rich in tocopherols with a predominance of \xCE\xB4-tocopherol.",
  "The sterol marker \xCE\xB2-sisosterol accounted for 39.6% of total sterols contained
    in seed oil of this variety.", 'Six phenolic acids were detected, the syringic
    acid being predominant.', 'As a whole, based on its seed oil features, pumpkin
    may be considered as a valuable source for new multi-purpose products for industrial,
    cosmetic, and pharmaceutical utilisation.']
