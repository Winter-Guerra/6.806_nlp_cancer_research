['The total phenolic, flavonoid and tannin contents in leaves extracts of Ocimum basilicum
    international cultivars, as well as their overall antioxidant activities using
    DPPH and linoleic acid assays, were investigated.', 'Furthermore, the antiproliferative
    and cytotoxic activities against line HeLa, MCF-7, Jurkat, HT-29, T24, MIAPaCa-2
    cancer cells and one normal human cell line HEK-293 were examined.', DPPH and
    linoleic acid assays ranged from 75.8% to 93.3% and from 74.5% to 97.1%; respectively.,
  O. b., "\u2018purple ruffle\u2019, O. b.", "\u2018dark opale\u2019, O. b.", "\u2018genovese\u2019,
    O. b.", "\u2018anise\u2019, O. b.", "\u2018bush green\u2019 and O. b. L. varied
    in their antiproliferative and cytotoxic activities, influenced cell cycle progression
    and stimulated apoptosis in most cancer cells.", OBL exhibited the highest antioxidant
    and antiproliferative activities., 'OB extracts not only improve taste but also
    have certain anticancer activity against diverse cancer cells due to the presence
    of compounds such as rosmarinic acid, chicoric acid and caftaric acid.', 'Thus,
    OB represents a potent source of anticancer materials.']
