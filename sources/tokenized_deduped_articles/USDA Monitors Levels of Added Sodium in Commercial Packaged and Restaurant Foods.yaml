[This manuscript describes progress by the Nutrient Data Laboratory in monitoring
    sodium in processed and prepared foods frequently consumed by the U.S. population.,
  'Recent concerns by the U.S. public health community about the intake of sodium
    by Americans have led ARS, USDA to develop a plan to monitor the levels of sodium
    in highly consumed commercial packaged and restaurant foods.', 'NDL scientists
    worked with USDAs Food Surveys Research Group to identify 125 Sentinel Foods,
    to serve as indicators for assessment of change in the sodium content in the food
    supply.', For each food NDL used market share data to identify the predominant
    brands and types of foods to be monitored for changes in the sodium level over
    time., 'Periodically, nutrient values for frequently consumed foods will be updated
    by chemical analysis or label checks.', Estimates will be compared to existing
    values in the National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference., 'Since 2010,
    about 140 foods have been sampled and analyzed by NDL contractors.', NDL will
    continue to generate new sodium data which will be disseminated in the successive
    releases of the SR., Accurate and current data for sodium in processed foods will
    support the assessment of changes in sodium in foods as well as the assessment
    of sodium intake by the U.S. population in the years ahead.]
