["Tomatoes produce the bioactive compounds lycopene and \u03B1-tomatine that are reported
    to have potential health-promoting effects in animals and humans, but our understanding
    of the roles of these compounds in the diet is incomplete.", 'Our current knowledge
    gained from the chemistry and analysis of these compounds in fresh and processed
    tomatoes and from studies on their bioavailability, bioactivity, and mechanisms
    of action against cancer cells and other beneficial bioactivities including antibiotic,
    anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, cardiovascular, and immunostimulating effects
    in cells, animals, and humans is discussed and interpreted here.', Areas for future
    research are also suggested., "The collated information and suggested research
    might contribute to a better understanding of the agronomical, biochemical, chemical,
    physiological, molecular, and cellular bases of the health-promoting effects and
    facilitate and guide further studies needed to optimize the use of lycopene and
    \u03B1-tomatine in pure form and in fresh tomatoes and processed tomato products
    to help prevent or treat human disease.", "anticarcinogenic effects; cardiovascular

    health; research needs\n\n\n\nTomatoes are a major source of nourishment for the
    world\u2019s population.", World production of tomatoes is estimated at around
    159 million tons with about 13 million tons grown in the United States., "(1)
    Tomato plants synthesize the bioactive carotenoid pigments lycopene and \u03B2-carotene
    and the glycoalkaloids dehydrotomatine, \u03B1-tomatine, and esculeoside A, possibly
    as a defense against bacteria, fungi, viruses, and insects.", 'About 20 years
    ago, we initiated studies designed to increase our knowledge of the analysis,
    composition, and bioactivities of tomato compounds, cited here in chronological
    order.', '(2-14)


    As discussed in one of our studies,(15) nature seems to have decreed that the
    concentration of the red lycopene pigment should increase as the tomato fruit
    ripens and changes color on the vine.', This increase is accompanied by a concurrent
    decrease in the concentration of tomatine., 'Green tomatoes therefore have a high
    content of tomatine, as high as 500 mg/kg fresh wt,(8) whereas the highest content
    in red tomatoes is only about 5 mg/kg.', Tomatoes at intermediate stages of maturity
    contain less lycopene and more tomatine than do mature tomatoes., 'For example,
    the reported lycopene content of large green tomatoes increases from 8 to 124,
    to 230, then to 374, and finally to 412 in the stages of fruit ripening.', '(16)
    In addition, environmental factors, agricultural practice, size, and color of
    different tomato varieties and conditions used to process tomatoes into juices,
    ketchup, pastes, purees, sauces, soups, and dry tomatoes all are reported to influence
    the content of bioactive compounds.', "For example, the tomatine content of the
    same variety of tomatoes harvested from plants grown under \u201Corganic\u201D
    soil and environmental conditions is about twice that of fruit from plants grown
    under conventional conditions.", '(17)


    In addition to investigations of the beneficial properties of the tomato products
    described above, the use of tomato-based edible antimicrobial films has been studied
    as a means of preventing the adverse effects of contaminated food and promoting
    human health associated with the consumption of tomatoes.', "(18, 19)\n\nBecause
    both lycopene and \u03B1-tomatine have been reported to elicit anticarcinogenic
    and other beneficial effects in vitro and in vivo, the main objective of this
    overview is to integrate the widely scattered information on the anticarcinogenic
    potential of these two bioactive tomato compounds in particular, both in pure
    form and in widely consumed fresh and processed tomatoes.", Brief summaries of
    their cardiovascular and other beneficial effects are also included., 'The aim
    here is also to suggest further research approaches in these areas to potentially
    enhance the health-promoting effects of these natural compounds, individually
    and in combination with other bioactive food ingredients.', The overlapping cellular
    and molecular mechanistic aspects of the research are described for a better understanding
    of the health-promoting potential of the tomato compounds., Such an understanding
    can lead to the development of improved tomatoes and tomato-based foods designed
    to enhance nutrition and health., "The first part of this review covers lycopene
    and the second part covers the tomato glycoalkaloid \u03B1-tomatine and the aglycone
    tomatidine.", 'Tomatoes seem to contain about 80% of dietary lycopene, with apricots,
    pink grapefruits, pink guavas, papayas, red carrots, watermelons, and algae contributing
    the other 20%.', (20-26) The red pigment lycopene is a polyunsaturated straight-chain
    molecule containing 13 double bonds with a molecular weight of 536.9 and an absorption
    maximum of 470 nm., The double bonds can exist in trans and cis configurations.,
  '(27) Although the all-trans form seems to be the natural form of lycopene synthesized
    by the tomato plant, the molecule is susceptible to isomerization under the influence
    of conditions used to process food, including heat, light, acids, and oxygen.',
  The trans form is also partly transformed in vivo to the more bioactive cis form.,
  Figure 1., Structures of bioactive tomato compounds., 'The structure of esculeoside
    A was adapted from Nohara et al.,(177) and the structures of the two lycopene
    isomers were adapted from Hernandez-Marin et al.', '(27)


    Strong antioxidative and other in vitro and in vivo beneficial effects of lycopenes
    are associated with their ability to act as free radical scavengers.', '(28) Lycopene
    is a highly efficient singlet oxygen quencher, both in vitro and in plasma, suggesting
    that its antioxidant effects might involve scavenging free electrons from reactive
    oxygen species.', '(29) Free radicals are highly reactive, short-lived molecules
    that can react with and damage essential structural proteins, enzymes, and DNA.',
  'Such damage has the potential to cause cancer, atherosclerosis, cardiovascular,
    and other diseases.', 'Lycopene has the potential to reduce such undesirable molecular
    events because the high-energy, highly reactive free electron on DNA is transformed
    to a much less reactive more stable free electron after it is dissipated along
    the conjugated 13 double bonds of the lycopene molecule.', An analogous mechanism
    governs antioxidative effects of plant phenolic compounds such as chlorogenic
    acid., "(30)\n\nThese observations can explain the extraordinary multidisciplinary
    interest in lycopene, as evidenced by the fact that the Scopus database lists
    more than 6400 citations under \u201Clycopene\u201D.", 'Here, we will discuss
    some of the relevant multidisciplinary studies that enhance our understanding
    of the role of tomato-derived lycopene in the plant and in the diet.', 'The mostly
    trans-lycopene isomer in fresh tomatoes is converted both in vitro under the influence
    of heat and enzymatically in vivo to less stable but more bioavailable 9-, 13-,
    and 15-cis-lycopenes.', (31) The following capsule summaries provide an introduction
    into the extensive literature on the analysis of lycopene isomers., 'Because geometrical
    isomers of carotenoids differ in their stability to oxidants and bioavailability,
    with the cis-isomer of lycopene being more bioavailable than the trans-form,(32)
    it is important to know the content of cis/trans isomers for nutritional and other
    studies.', 'To meet this need, Melendez-Martinez et al.', (33) used an HPLC method
    to analyze up to 48 carotenoid isomers in 62 min and to detect 26 isomers in biological
    samples., Ishida et al., (34-36) used an HPLC method to follow the partial transformation
    of all-tetra-cis-lycopene during heating and juicing of tangerine tomatoes to
    trans\- and other cis-forms., 'In another study, Hernandez-Marin et al.', (27)
    calculated antioxidant properties of lycopene isomers and their relative abilities
    to transfer one electron to the hydroxyl radical., 'The calculations predict that
    neutral cis\- and trans-isomers maintain the same color, whereas the color of
    ionic species shifts to a longer wavelength.', 'Interestingly, refluxing a tomato
    resin in ethyl acetate for 1 week results in transformation of the lycopene E-isomer
    to the more stable and more bioavailable 13Z-, 9Z-, and 5Z-lycopene isomers.',
  (37) Plasma levels of lycopene isomers are related to the levels present in food.,
  (38) Consumption patterns of carotenoid isomers can be used to improve disease prevention.,
  (39) Honest et al., (31) reviewed the literature on the relationship between lycopene
    isomerization and bioavailability and bioactivity properties., Additional studies
    designed to optimize the analysis of lycopene and its isomers in different milieus
    are described by Panthee et al., (13) and Luterotti et al., '(40) The availability
    of C-13 labeled lycopene is expected to facilitate human bioavailability, metabolism,
    and pharmacokinetic studies.', '(41, 42)



    Several factors can affect the lycopene content of fresh tomatoes, as highlighted
    in the following selected studies.', Figure 2., "HPLC chromatogram showing separation
    of lycopene and \u03B2-carotene in a red tomato extract.", '(137)


    Cherry tomatoes grown under the influence of moderate salt stress contained higher
    amounts carotenoids and exhibited increased lipophilic antioxidative capacity
    compared with tomatoes grown in the absence of stress.', '(43) The carotenoid
    content of different tomato varieties grown in Ireland differed significantly
    from those grown in Spain, suggesting that geographical location has a greater
    effect on carotenoid content and bioaccessability, which is defined as the amount
    of ingested carotenoids available for absorption by the intestinal cells after
    digestion.', "(44) Tomatoes grown under \u201Corganic\u201D conditions contained
    greater amounts of total phenolics as well as \u03B1-tomatine than tomatoes grown
    under conventional conditions.", '(17, 45, 46) Evidently, because of the absence
    of synthetic pesticides, tomato plants grown under organic conditions synthesize
    more secondary metabolites for protection against phytopathogens than do tomato
    plants grown under conventional conditions.', Sun et al., (47) describe genes
    that control lycopene content of growing tomatoes., Amplification of these genes
    using molecular biology techniques might make it possible to create high-lycopene
    tomatoes., It is also relevant to note that the carbon to nitrogen ratio of the
    tomato plant seems to be a good indicator of the concentrations of phenolic compounds
    and tomatine that are involved in defense against phytopathogens., "(48) We recently
    found that the lycopene and \u03B2-carotene contents as well as the contents of
    11 phenolic compounds of 12 different varieties of greenhouse-grown commercial
    cherry tomatoes varied widely, suggesting that genetic factors seem to govern
    the biosynthesis of bioactive compounds in cherry tomatoes.", '(12)



    Exposure of tomatoes to processing conditions used by food processors, restaurants,
    and in the home designed to prepare a wide range of edible tomato products can,
    in principle, adversely or beneficially affect the lycopene content of the final
    products, as illustrated by the following selected observations.', An early review
    on the influence of food processing(49) on lycopene states that thermal processing
    causes some loss in tomato-based foods; heat induces isomerization of the all-trans\-
    to the cis-form; dehydrated and powdered tomatoes have poor lycopene stability;
    frozen and heat-sterilized foods exhibit excellent stability; the bioavailability
    of the cis-isomers in foods is higher than that of all -trans -isomers; and lycopene
    bioavailability in processed products is higher than in fresh tomatoes., "Analysis
    of catsup from 13 commercial sources showed that the content of lycopene ranged
    from 59.4 to 183.6 \u03BCg/g and the Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity from
    176.5 to 356.8 TEAC units.", (35) The antioxidative activity of ketchup was related
    to its content of trans-lycopene., "(50) Thermal processing of tomato pulp at
    130 \xB0C improved the in vitro bioaccessability of lycopene, defined as the fraction
    of the nutrient that is released from the food matrix.", '(51, 52) all-trans-Lycopene
    and other carotenoids underwent isomerization during canning and storage of tomato
    juice.', "(53) Related studies showed that during storage of tomato juices, lycopene
    degradation varied as a function of the tomato cultivar, processing method, storage
    temperature, and time and that the use combined pressure\u2013heat treatments
    increases lycopene extractability;(54-57) and exposure of tomato juice to pulsed
    electric fields resulted in a higher content of polyphenolic compounds(58) and
    had a higher content of volatile compounds and better sensory properties than
    juice prepared with untreated tomatoes.", '(50, 59) A study with tomato pasta
    indicates that the in vitro accessibility of lycopene seems to be influenced by
    the conditions applied during in vitro intestinal digestion.', (60) High-pressure
    sterilization of a tomato puree limited lycopene isomerization compared with the
    equivalent thermal sterilization., (61) Aseptic thermal processing of tomato soup
    reduced vitamin C content but had only a minor effect on lycopene content., "(52)
    Oven-baking of sliced tomatoes at 160 \xB0C for 20 min resulted in significant
    increases in the content of lycopene, \u03B2-carotene, and \u03B1-tocopherol,
    isomerization of all-E to various Z isomers, and in an increased release of the
    carotenoids and tocopherols from the tomato matrix.", '(62) An investigation of
    industrial processing on the stability of tomato carotenoids indicates that, overall,
    the nutritional quality of tomato-processed products is mainly preserved during
    manufacture, except for vitamin C.(63)


    Thermal and pressure treatment of a puree containing olive oil induced both degradation
    of lycopene and conversion of trans\- to cis-isomers.', "(61) A related study
    found that thermal treatment of tomatoes breaks down cell walls, thus facilitating
    the release of carotenoids and tocopherols from the matrix, and increases isomerization
    of lycopene and to a lesser extent of \u03B2-carotene.", "(62) Postharvest treatment
    of vine-ripe tomatoes resulted in a 14% increase in lycopene and a decrease in
    \u03B2-carotene content.", '(64) Other tomato processing conditions that might
    affect the content and bioavailability of lycopene include exposure to a pulsed
    electric field,(65) supercritical extraction,(66) and high-pressure homogenization.',
  (67) Real-time monitoring of lycopene content during the production of tomato juice
    may allow payment to tomato growers based on the lycopene content of the crops.,
  '(68)



    Numerous studies have been devised to attempt to determine whether the observed
    cancer cell-inhibiting effects of lycopene in vitro could be confirmed in vivo
    in animal models and in humans.', Selected recent studies mentioned below show
    that the results do not seem to offer a definitive answer., 'Because tomato and
    soy products have each shown anti-prostate cancer activity in laboratory studies,
    Zuniga et al.', (69) determined the effect of dietary tomato and soy germ alone
    and in combination against prostate carcinogenesis in the transgenic adenocarcinoma
    of the mouse prostate model., The results show that the combination diet was most
    effective in reducing the proliferative index in the prostate epithelium of the
    mice., "The authors suggest the need to develop tomato\u2013soy foods with defined
    composition and bioactivities for clinical trials.", "A structure\u2013activity
    study of 11 synthetic carotenoids against breast cancer cells provides mechanistic
    evidence for their bioactivities in terms of activation of the electrophile/antioxidant
    response element transcription system and induced expression of phase II metabolizing
    enzymes.", (70) Related studies suggest that some of the cellular effects of carotenoids
    might be mediated through their derivatives formed in vivo by chemical oxidation
    or enzymatic cleavage inside the cells., "(71, 72)\n\nOn the basis of a review
    of the literature, Sporn and Liby(73) concluded that although lycopene has been
    shown to prevent cancer in experimental animals, the compound is not potent enough
    to be clinically useful as a drug for prostate cancer, mainly because high concentrations
    above 1 \u03BCmol/L are needed to achieve meaningful biological responses in humans.",
  Ilic et al., (74-76) came to a similar conclusion on the basis of an analysis of
    the literature that there is insufficient evidence to either support or refute
    the use of lycopene for the prevention of prostate cancer., Related studies examine
    differences in consumption of carotenoids by different ethnic groups(39) and the
    association between the prostate-specific antigen screening test and lycopene
    consumption., '(77)



    Unlike anticancer drugs, the molecular mechanisms of natural compounds involve
    modulation of multiple targets, including transcription factors, growth factors,
    tumor cell survival factors, inflammatory pathways, and invasion and angiogenesis
    linked to carcinogenesis.', '(78-84) The complex, overlapping mechanisms of lycopene
    action on cancer cells involving antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, immunostimulating
    effects, up-regulation of connexin-43, and modulation of cyclo-oxygenase pathways,
    growth factors, and growth factor receptors have been extensively studied.', (85-90)
    The following brief summaries of selected biomarkers and signaling pathways offer
    an indication of the complexity of these mechanisms., "\u2022 Lycopene-induced
    apoptosis against hepatocarcinogenesis in female Balb/c mice might be due to its
    ability to act on apoptosis-associated genes and as a pro-oxidant.", "(56, 91)\n\n\u2022
    Proteins in human primary prostatic epithelial cells that were most affected by
    lycopene were those that were involved in antioxidant responses, apoptosis, growth

    ascribed to lycopene.', "\u2022 Physiological concentrations of lycopene attenuated
    the lipopolysaccharide-mediated induction of TNF-\u03B1 in RAW 264.7 macrophages

    amelioration of CVD risk factors was observed in 18 healthy women consuming tomato
    juice supplemented with n-3-polyunsaurated fatty acids versus plain tomato juice.',
  "(129) A study designed to determine lycopene\u2019s ability to modulate systemic
    and high-density lipoprotein-associated inflammation in moderately overweight
    middle-aged individuals showed that the tomato compound significantly increased
    HDL functionality, revealing the heart-protective properties of increased lycopene
    intake.", (130) A 2 week intervention study with Mexican individuals showed that
    consumption of two raw tomatoes per day for 2 weeks resulted in a significant
    increase in HDL plasma cholesterol from 36.5 to 41.6 mg/DL., "(131)\n\n\u2022
    An intervention trial with healthy middle-aged volunteers showed that a high daily
    consumption of tomato-based products or lycopene supplements was ineffective in
    reducing CVD inflammatory and insulin resistance markers.", "(132) Low plasma
    concentrations of antioxidative lutein and zeaxanthin, but not lycopene, \u03B2-cryptoxanthin,
    or \u03B1-carotene, were associated with increased risk of atrial fibrillation
    in elderly individuals.", "(133, 134)\n\n\u2022 The administration of tomato-based
    food for special medical purposes to 8 healthy volunteers and 39 patients with
    chronic hepatitis C virus prevented carotenoid serum depletion, did not affect
    the therapeutic response, but was effective in improving the oxidative stress
    during viral therapy.", "(135)\n\n\u2022 A prospective study of 1031 Finnish men
    aged 46\u201365 years showed that men with the highest quartile of serum lycopene
    had 59 and 55% lower risks of ischemic stroke and any stroke, respectively, compared
    with men in the lowest quartile.", "\u2022 A clinical study showed that locally
    delivered lycopene gel was effective in reducing gingival inflammation and injury
    compared to a placebo in smoking and nonsmoking subjects.", '(136)


    The cited human consumption, bioavailability, and health-promoting studies originating
    from different countries clearly show that plasma lycopene levels are a function
    of the dietary content of fresh and processed tomatoes and that high levels are
    associated with lower risk of CVD and some cancers.', 'I agree with the suggestion
    by a journal reviewer that because lycopenes are more bioavailable from processed
    than from fresh tomatoes, clinical and epidemiological studies should compare
    beneficial effects from both lycopene sources.', "We previously reported that
    the tomato glycoalkaloid referred to as tomatine consisted of a \u223C10:1 mixture
    of \u03B1-tomatine and dehydrotomatine.", "(5, 137) The structure of dehydrotomatine
    is different from that of \u03B1-tomatine in that the former molecule has a double
    bond in the steroidal ring B of the aglycone.", 'Note that both tomato glycoalkaloids

    peaks from the tomato extracts.", 'Second, samples from each peak, collected several
    times from the HPLC column, were then acid hydrolyzed into sugars and aglycone.',
  The sugars were converted to trimethylsilyl ester derivatives., "Individual compositions

    of tomatoes varied from 42 to 1498 \u03BCg/g of fresh wt and from 521 to 16285
    \u03BCg/g of fresh wt, respectively.", "The ratio of \u03B1-tomatine to dehydrotomatine
    ranged from 10.9 to 12.5 in tomatoes and from 2.3 to 7.8 in other plant tissues,
    suggesting that the biosynthesis of the glycoalkaloids seems to be under separate
    genetic control in each plant part.", "Another study(9) showed that the dehydrotomatine
    content of six green tomatoes ranged from 0.89 to 8.05, a 9.0-fold variation from
    lowest to highest value; the corresponding range for \u03B1-tomatine was from

    glycoalkaloids ranged from 6.64 to 39.45, a 5.9-fold variation; and the total
    glycoalkaloid content per tomato fruit ranged from 434.0 to 1110.4, a 2.56-fold
    variation.", It is well-known that tomatine decreases during the ripening process.,
  '(15) The cited data show that both individual and total amounts of glycoalkaloids
    in green tomatoes vary widely, but less so when calculated in terms of concentration
    per fruit.', 'Although the glycoalkaloid content per weight of fruit decreases
    as the fruit grows, the values per unit fruit remain about the same, until the
    fruit turns red, at which time the tomatine is nearly completely degraded.', 'Statistical
    analysis showed that size, maturity, and glycoalkaloid content are well correlated.',
  Additional studies on the analysis of tomato glycoalkaloids are described in the
    cited references., "(8, 17, 48, 137, 140, 141)\n\nInterestingly, some wild-type

    cultivars grown in the Andes mountains of Peru.", "(143)\n\n\nInhibitory concentrations
    at 50% values for \u03B1-tomatine were calculated by constructing a four-parameter
    logistic curve using the values from percentage inhibition of normal and human
    cancer cells, with the aid of SigmaPlot 11; the IC50 was extrapolated from the
    graph at 50% cell inhibition.", 'The IC50 was compared to a number of variables
    in the tomatoes: tomato size, ripeness, and alkaloid content.', 'Using a microculture
    tetrazolium in vitro assay, we previously reported that tomatine is a strong inhibitor
    of growth for both human colon and liver cancer cell lines, as evidenced by the
    dose-dependent inhibition of HT29 colon cancer cells at levels ranging from 38.0

    other investigators in defining the detailed molecular mechanism of apoptosis.",
  "Here, we will briefly summarize published information on the inhibition of cancer
    by \u03B1-tomatine.", Shih et al., "(147) investigated the mechanism of the antimetastatic
    effect of \u03B1-tomatine in human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells.", "They found
    that the glycoalkaloid inhibited cell invasion and migration and phosphorylation
    of Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2; did not affect phosphorylation
    of c-Jun N-terminal kinase and the p38 gene; decreased nuclear levels of nuclear
    factor kappa B, c-Fos, and C-Jun; and inhibited binding abilities of NF-\u03BAB
    and activator protein-1.", "These and related molecular events suggest that inhibition
    of metastasis occurs by reducing MMP-2, MMP-9, and u-PA activities through suppression
    of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt (PI3K/Akt or ERK1/2 signaling pathway and
    inhibition of NF-\u03BAB or AP-1 binding activities.", "The authors suggest that
    these results indicate that \u03B1-tomatine may have therapeutic value in the
    treatment of lung cancer.", A related study by Shieh et al., "(148) confirmed

    antimetastatic effect occurs through inactivation of the signaling pathway and
    enhancement of IkB\u03B1 protein expressions to reduce NF-\u03BAB DNA binding
    activity, resulting in down-regulation of MMP-7 expression.", Additional events
    that contribute to inhibition of cell migration and invasion include interference
    with the rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton by decreasing the expression
    of pFAK protein., Lee et al., "(149, 150) investigated the molecular mechanism
    of the antiproliferative effect of \u03B1-tomatine against human prostatic adenocarcinoma

    found that the IC50 of the inhibition was 1.67 \u03BCM, with cytotoxicity against
    the PC-3 cells occurring after an hour of treatment.", The cytotoxicity against
    normal liver and prostate cells was lower than against the PC-3 cells., "They
    concluded that cytotoxicity was mainly due to induction of apoptosis, as evidenced
    by decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and increased nuclear condensation;
    polarization of F-actin potential; cell membrane permeability and cytochrome C
    expression; induction of activation of caspase-3, -8, and -9; inhibition of NF-\u03BAB
    nuclear translocation; and a decrease in NF-\u03BAB/p50 and NF-\u03BABp65 in the
    nuclear fraction.", "These observations imply that both intrinsic and extrinsic
    pro-apoptosis pathways are involved and that \u03B1-tomatine may protect against
    prostate cancer development and progression.", "The observation that TNF-\u03B1
    treatment enhances the motility and invasiveness of prostatic cancer cells suggests
    that this pro-inflammatory protein contributes to cancer metastasis(151) and that
    \u03B1-tomatine-induced reduction in TNF-\u03B1 levels may help overcome these
    molecular events.", "K\xFAdelov\xE1 et al.", "(152) discovered that \u03B1-tomatine
    inhibits human leukemia MOLT-4 cells by activating cell cycle checkpoints without
    damaging single or double DNA strands in the cells.", The induced slowing of the
    cell cycle seems to involve caspase-independent cell death associated with an
    increase in p53 and the BH3-only protein and other protein biomarkers associated
    in cell cycle regulation., 'In a long-term study, we showed that feeding 2000
    ppm of commercial tomatine and 224 ppm of the multiorgan carcinogen dibenzopyrene

    41.3 and 36.3%, respectively, as compared to the incidence of tumors observed
    with DBP alone.', (153) The rainbow trout model is highly sensitive to diverse
    chemical carcinogens and is a statistically powerful vertebrate model used in
    many comparative studies of chemical carcinogenesis and its modulation by dietary
    inhibitors., "To our knowledge, this study seems to be the first report that evaluated
    the anticarcinogenicity of \u03B1-tomatine in vivo.", "The following in vivo observations

    synthesis in the tumor cells with IC50 values of 8.7 and 6.6 \u03BCM, respectively.",
  "The authors note that the activity against Ehrlich tumors, which are derived from
    adenocarcinoma of the mammary gland, seems to involve the immune system in the
    inhibition of tumor progression, and because the ip LD50 value of \u03B1-tomatine
    is high at 32.4 mg/kg,(152) the effectiveness of the 1 mg/kg dose seems to indicate
    that this is a safe dose.", 'Because the intravenous LD50 dose is lower at 18

    prostate cancer in humans.", "(150) We do not know whether oral consumption of
    \u03B1-tomatine, individually or in combination with lycopene or cancer drugs,
    would elicit similar beneficial effects in rodents and humans.", The cited studies

    that \u03B1-tomatine induces programmed cell death by ROS in the fungal pathogen
    Fusarium oxysporum: cell death occurred only under aerobic condition and was blocked
    by mitochondrial ATPase, caspase, and protein inhibitors; fungal cells showed
    depolarization of the transmembrane potential of mitochondria and ROS accumulation;

    aglycone part of \u03B1-tomatine, tomatidine, must also contribute to the overall
    bioactivity because authentic tomatidine also inhibited cancer cells, but at a
    significantly lower rate than the carbohydrate-containing glycoalkaloid.", 'Here,
    we will briefly mention anticarcinogenic and other beneficial effects of tomatidine.',
  "Our studies showed that both \u03B1-tomatine and tomatidine changed the membrane
    potential of frog embryos and affected active transport in frog skin(162) and
    orally consumed tomatidine did not significantly affect organ weights of mice.",
  '(163, 164) Lavie et al.', '(165) reported that tomatidine acted as a potent and
    effective chemosensitizer in multidrug-resistant tumor cells, sensitizing the
    cells to the cytotoxic action of adriamycin and verapamil.', The authors suggest
    that tomatidine could serve in combination chemotherapy with cytotoxic drugs for
    treating multidrug-resistant cancer., 'Although tomatidine did not inhibit A549
    human lung carcinoma cells, Yan et al.', (166) discovered that nontoxic doses
    of the alkaloid inhibited the invasion of the A549 cells by reducing metalloproteinase
    expression., "They found that tomatidine does not effectively inhibit the viability
    of the A540 cells and nontoxic doses of the compound suppressed cell invasion,
    did not affect cell migration, reduced mRNA levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9, increased
    the expression of tissue inhibitor metalloproteinase-1, and inhibited NF-\u03BAB
    activity and ERK and Akt signaling pathways.", The mechanism for the suppression
    of cell invasion is similar to the one we observed with mushrooms., '(82)


    Chiu and Lin(167) investigated anti-inflammatory effects of tomatidine and solasodine
    in LPS-stimulated macrophages.', "Tomatidine decreased inducible nitric oxide
    synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 expression through suppression of I-kB\u03B1 phosphorylation,
    NF-\u03BAB nuclear translocation, and JNK activation.", "The results imply that
    the anti-inflammatory effect seems associated with the blockage of NF-\u03BAB
    and JNK signaling, suggesting that the aglycone could prevent cancer and inflammatory
    diseases.", 'Solasodine, the structure of which is identical to that of tomatidine
    except that it lacks a double bond in the 5,6-position of the B ring, was less
    potent.', Mitchell et al., (168) investigated the inhibition by tomatidine of
    Staphylococcus aureus small-colony variants in cystic fibrosis airway epithelial
    cells., SCVs are often associated with S. aureus infection encountered by cystic
    fibrosis patients., "The authors found that tomatidine was a potent growth inhibitor
    of SCVs at a minimum inhibitory concentration of 0.12 \u03BCg/mL.", The authors
    suggest that tomatidine in combination with antibiotics could eliminate persistent
    forms of S. aureus that adversely affect the airways of cystic fibrosis patients.,
  'It would be of interest to find out whether the olive compound 4-hyroxytyrosol,
    which we found to inhibit S. aureus bacteria in vitro, would also inhibit SCVs.',
  '(169-171)


    A related study by Mitchell et al.', (172) found that tomatidine potentiates the
    effect of aminoglycoside antibiotics against multiresistant S. aureus pathogens
    by preventing expression of virulence microbial genes., Tomatidine also inhibited
    growth of Leishmania amazonensis promastigotes flagellated protozoan parasites
    that cause about 2 million new infections annually., '(172) The mechanism of inhibition
    seems to involve interference with the growth, ultrastructure, sterol content,
    and mitochondrial function of the protozoa.', 'Because tomatoes are reported to
    be contaminated by Salmonella and other foodborne pathogens,(173, 174) it would
    be of interest to find out whether lycopene and tomatine can inactivate the pathogens.',
  Fujiwara et al., '(175) found that dietary tomatidine significantly ameliorated
    hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis in apoE-deficient mice by inhibiting acyl-A:cholesterol
    acyl-transferase activity.', Shao et al., '(176) found that dietary tomato pomace,
    seed oil, and defatted seed also reduced cholesterol in hamsters.', 'Orally fed
    esculeoside A, a minor glycoalkaloid isolated from ripe tomatoes, reduced serum

  '(177) Serum cholesterol and blood antiplatelet effects elicited by green tomatoes

    content of green tomatoes mentioned above.', "It seems that both \u03B1-tomatine(145,
    179) and tomatidine have the potential to protect against CVD.", Mechanisms responsible
    for the anticarcinogenic effects of tomato glycoalkaloids differ from mechanisms
    proposed for lycopene present in red tomatoes., "To place the above-mentioned
    observations on mechanistic aspects in perspective, we will summarize additional
    reported biological effects of \u03B1-tomatine and tomatidine.", Tomatine alone
    and tomatine-rich green tomato diets reduced both dietary cholesterol bioavailability
    and endogenous cholesterol., '(145, 179) Tomatine inhibited active transport by
    increasing the general permeability of membranes of the surface of averted rat
    jejunal sacs(180) and removed cholesterol from mucosal cells as well as the output
    of cholesterol into the lymph.', '(181) Unlike tomatine, tomatidine did not induce
    cell membrane disruptions in fungi and yeasts.', (182) Tomatine and tomatidine
    exhibited weak inhibition of the Hedgehog signaling pathway in the embryonic zebra
    fish developmental assay., (183) Such inhibition seems to be associated with developmental
    defects., 'Here, we will mention the available information on the safety of tomatine
    in animal models.', "The following LD50 values have been reported for tomatine
    in mice: ip, 25\u201333.5; iv, 18; oral, 500; subcutaneous, &gt;1000.", '(156,
    184-186) Tomsik et al.', (155) note that the 1 mg/kg dose of tomatine they used
    in their mouse study is a safe dose., 'As part of the anticarcinogenic feeding
    study of tomatine to rainbow trout mentioned earlier, we found that the tomatine-containing
    diets did not induce changes in mortality, fish weights, liver weights, or tissue
    morphology.', (153) No adverse pathological effects in the tissues of the fish
    on the tomatine diets were observed., The apparent lack of acute toxicity in the
    rainbow trout reinforces the reported low toxicity in animal models., "We observed
    a similar lack of toxicity in hamsters orally fed \u03B1-tomatine.", "(8, 145,
    179)\n\nA key consideration for the use of pure \u03B1-tomatine and of high-\u03B1-tomatine
    tomatoes in cancer prevention and treatment should be the ratio of effective preventive
    or therapeutic to toxic dose.", The apparent nontoxicity of tomatine in animal
    models is reinforced by the fact that Peruvians consume without deleterious effects
    high-tomatine red tomatoes and that in some countries high-tomatine pickled green
    tomatoes are part of the human diet., "(143, 187) The bioavailability and safety
    of \u03B1-tomatine and tomatidine merit further study.", 'The cited observations
    suggest that the mechanism(s) of the chemopreventive effect of tomatine may be
    the result of multiple molecular events including the formation of complexes with
    cholesterol, potentiation of the immune system, and direct destruction of cancer
    cells via disruption of cell membranes, reviewed previously.', '(7) Because tomatine
    induces antigen-specific cellular immunity in mice, it possesses remarkable potential
    as a vaccine adjuvant for infectious diseases as well as for cancer immunotherapy.',
  '(146) By stimulating the immune system, tomatine-rich green tomatoes may also protect
    against lethal infections by foodborne pathogens such as Salmonella, as has been
    reported for potato glycoalkaloids(188) and mushroom and herbal extracts.', '(189,
    190)


    Red tomatoes contain numerous health-promoting ingredients, including antioxidative
    carotenoids, anthocyanins, phenolic compounds, and flavonoids as well as vitamins
    A, B, and C(191) and lectins.', '(192) Unlike green tomatoes, which contain high
    levels of tomatine and chlorophyll but no lycopene, red tomatoes contain high
    levels of lycopene and very low amounts of glycoalkaloids.', '(2, 15, 137)


    The cited information on anticarcinogenic, anticholesterol, and other beneficial
    effects of tomatine suggests the desirability of developing new varieties of tomatine-rich
    red tomatoes.', 'These tomatoes would contain two classes of anticarcinogenic
    compounds: tomato glycoalkaloids that stimulate the immune system, form complexes
    with cholesterol, and disrupt cell membranes and inhibit growth and metastasis
    of cancer cells in vivo; and antioxidative lycopene that may act by suppressing
    free radicals that damage DNA by mechanisms discussed elsewhere.', (193) This
    objective could be accomplished by breeding high-tomatine tomatoes into commercial
    lines or by suppressing the genes that govern the formation of enzymes that degrade
    tomatine during postharvest ripening of green to red tomatoes., "The cited studies
    suggest that plant breeders and plant molecular biologists should create new red
    tomato varieties containing high amounts of both lycopene and \u03B1-tomatine.",
  It may also be possible to develop tomatine-containing potatoes by crossing high-tomatine-containing
    accessions of the wild potato Solanum acaule with cultivated Solanum tuberosum
    varieties., '(6, 142) In the meantime, consumers may benefit from eating both
    lycopene-rich red and tomatine-rich green tomatoes as well as processed tomato
    products.', 'According to Wattenberg,(194) a pioneer in chemoprevention, chemoprevention
    of cancer is a means of cancer control in which the occurrence of the disease
    is prevented by chemical compounds that can block and prevent carcinogens from
    reaching or reacting with critical tissue target sites and suppressing agents
    that prevent the evolution of the neoplastic process in cells that could otherwise
    become malignant.', Wattenberg also noted that the great chemical diversity of
    natural inhibitors suggests the possibility of selecting optimal and safe natural
    products for human studies., These considerations stimulated worldwide interest
    in the development of phytomedicines against various types of cancer., "The attempt
    of this review to integrate and interpret results from our studies and from studies
    by other investigators on the anticarcinogenic and other desirable activities
    of two bioactive tomato compounds, lycopene and \u03B1-tomatine, is, in part,
    designed to prove Wattenberg\u2019s prophetic predictions.", "The results of the
    cited studies suggest that both lycopene and \u03B1-tomatine might contribute
    to the prevention and therapy of human cancers and possibly also cardiovascular
    diseases.", "The cited studies imply that, aside from the need to confirm in vitro
    results with corresponding studies in animals and humans, possible synergism of
    combinations of lycopene and \u03B1-tomatine, both in pure form and in red and
    in green tomatoes and tomato products, is expected to provide health-promoting
    benefits that require lower concentrations of each bioactive compound.", The combination
    of a tomato-based diet with other food that has been shown to exhibit anticarcinogenic
    effects is also a major challenge for future studies., Combining bioactive food
    ingredients with other foods has the potential to elicit additive or synergistic
    anticarcinogenic effects with lower plasma levels of lycopene and tomatine., This
    is a largely unexplored area., "For example, it would be of interest to find out
    whether different combinations of red tomatoes containing high levels of lycopene
    and green tomatoes containing high amounts of the tomato glycoalkaloid tomatine
    with, for example, the citrus compounds nobiletin(195) and poncirin,(196) pomegranate
    compounds,(197, 198) resveratrol from grapes and berries,(199) and combinations
    with the rice bran ingredient \u03B3-oryzanol,(84) black rice bran,(81) wheat
    bran,(200) Hericium erinaceus mushrooms,(82) cruciferous vegetables,(201) jujube
    fruit,(202) curcumin-containing turmeric spices,(203, 204) and green and black
    tea catechins and theaflavins,(205, 206) all of which exhibited anticarcinogenic
    effects in vivo, would be effective against breast, colon, prostate, and other
    cancers.", 'Because the content of bioactive compounds in teas varies widely and
    storage might reduce their content, in vivo studies of combinations of lycopene
    with teas should use high-catechin green teas and/or high-theaflavin black teas
    of known composition.', '(207-218) Such dietary combinations, in which the individual
    components might exert their anticarcinogenic effects by different mechanisms,
    might act as multifunctional foods and might make it possible to use lower amounts
    of lycopene and tomatine in the final formulations.', 'Expectations are that multiple,
    food-based anticarcinogens that elicit cell responses by different mechanisms
    may provide enhanced efficacy against a variety of cancers.', I take great pleasure
    in thanking Carol E. Levin for her assistance with the preparation of the manuscript
    and as well as colleagues for excellent scientific collaboration.]
