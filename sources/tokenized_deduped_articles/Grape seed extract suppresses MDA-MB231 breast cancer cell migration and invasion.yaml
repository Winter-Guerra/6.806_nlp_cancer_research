[Breast cancer remains a leading cause of mortality among women., 'In metastasis,
    cascade migration of cancer cells and invasion of extracellular matrix represent
    critical steps.', 'Urokinase-type plasminogen activator, as well as metalloproteinases
    MMP-2 and MMP-9, strongly contribute to ECM remodelling, thus becoming associated
    with tumour migration and invasion.', 'In addition, the high expression of cytoskeletal
    proteins, as fascin, has been correlated with clinically aggressive metastatic
    tumours, and CSK proteins are thought to affect the migration of cancer cells.',
  'Consumption of fruits and vegetables, characterized by high procyanidin content,
    has been associated to a reduced mortality for breast cancer.', 'Therefore, we
    investigated the biological effect of grape seed extract on the highly metastatic
    MDA-MB231 breast cancer cell line, focusing on studying GSE ability in inhibiting
    two main metastatic processes, i.e., cell migration and invasion.', After MDA-MB231
    breast cancer cells stimulated with GSE migration and invasion were evaluated
    by means of trans-well assays and uPA as well as MMPs activity was detected by
    gelatin zymography., "Fascin, \u03B2-catenin and nuclear factor-\u03BAB expression
    were determined using western blot technique.", "\u03B2-Catenin localization was
    observed by confocal microscopy.", We observed that high concentrations of GSE
    inhibited cell proliferation and apoptosis., "Conversely, low GSE concentration
    decreased cell migration and invasion, likely by hampering \u03B2-catenin expression
    and localization, fascin and NF-\u03BAB expression, as well as by decreasing the
    activity of uPA, MMP-2 and MMP-9.", These results make GSE a powerful candidate
    for developing preventive agents against cancer metastasis., 'Despite the advances
    in the understanding mechanisms of cancer progression and in development of different
    therapeutic strategies, breast tumour is still the leading cause of mortality
    among women, particularly due to its metastasizing ability .', 'Metastasis is
    a multistep process, which involves migration, adhesion and invasion of cancer
    cells into the vessels, extravasation out of the vessel and interaction with the
    target tissue .', 'Extracellular matrix degradation is a critical event in the
    metastasizing process, and it is well recognized that it is essential in determining
    tumour prognosis and treatment .', 'The urokinase-type plasminogen activator strongly
    contributes to ECM remodelling, stimulating the conversion of inactive plasminogen
    to the protease plasmin, which mediates cellular invasion both directly by degrading
    members of the matrix proteins  and indirectly by activating matrix metalloproteinases
    .', 'Among human MMPs, MMP-2 and MMP-9 represent key enzymes in the degradation
    of type IV collagen of ECM, thus becoming associated with tumour migration and
    invasion .', 'Therefore, the inhibition of uPA and MMPs activity is extremely
    relevant to arrest metastasis, mostly affecting cancer development after carcinogenesis
    .', 'Moreover, cytoskeleton rearrangement, leading to enhancement of cell motility,
    is one of the dominant cellular mechanisms that regulates metastasis .', "It was
    reported that, in many human carcinomas including breast cancers, fascin, a member
    of the actin cytoskeletal\u2013bundling proteins contributing to filopodia development,
    is highly up-regulated , correlating with clinically aggressive tumours and metastasis
    .", "Also, recent evidence suggested fascin as a novel target gene of \u03B2-catenin-TCF
    signalling  that activates the expression of genes involved in invasion and metastasis,
    such MMPs, at later steps of cancer progression .", "In addition, fascin facilitates
    metastasizing process via modulation of metastasis-associated genes, specifically
    down-regulating the metastasis suppressor BRMS1 and up-regulating the nuclear
    factor-\u03BAB activity, as well as the induction of uPA, MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression
    .", "Therefore, down-regulating \u03B2-catenin, fascin, as well as MMPs and their
    regulatory pathways may represent a useful strategy for anticancer drugs and chemo-preventive
    agents .", 'Frequent consumption of certain fruits and vegetables has been associated
    with a reduced risk of developing cancer, particularly at breast and colon .',

    Several studies documented the biological properties of GSE and its principal
    compounds, such as catechins and procyanidins, particularly associated to their
    anticancer and chemo-preventive activities .', 'Indeed, even this study documented
    that high concentration of GSE inhibits cell proliferation and increases apoptosis
    in MDA-MB231 human breast cancer cell line.', 'To support the anti-proliferative
    and pro-apoptotic role of GSE against breast cancer cells, we determined GSE effect
    on another breast cancer cell line, MCF-7.', "In both cell lines, proliferation
    strongly decreased with 50 and 100 \u03BCg/ml GSE.", 'Focusing on the highest

  'Differently, in MDA-MB231, this effect was obtained with 50 as well.', 'As previously
    reported, this behaviour could be associated to the different malignant phenotype
    of each breast cancer cell line as well as to the sensitivity to the anticancer
    effects triggered by GSE .', 'Moreover, we explored the possible effects of GSE
    against breast cancer cell migration and invasion, two fundamental aspects of
    the metastatic process.', 'Experiments were performed on MDA-MB231 cells, more
    malignant and invasive than MCF-7 cells.', GSE at a sub-lethal concentration strongly
    inhibited cell migration and invasion., "Actually, this inhibition was accompanied
    by a decrease in uPA, MMP-2 and MMP-9 activities, as well as in a down-regulation
    of \u03B2-catenin, fascin and NF-\u03BAB expression.", These findings are in agreement
    with previous studies which investigated vegetal extract for their anti-invasive
    properties., 'Pachymic acid, derived from Poria cocos was shown to impair breast
    cancer cell invasion by suppressing matrix metalloproteinase-9 expression .',
  'Similar results were obtained with piceatannol, a natural analogue of resveratrol,
    that was reported to inhibit the invasive capability of human breast cancer cells,
    attenuating MMP-9 activity .', 'An anti-metastatic effect was observed treating
    MDA-MB-231 cells with ovatodiolide, the major component of the plant Anisomeles
    indica .', "Ovatodiolide inhibited metastasis by reducing MMP-9 and NF-\u03BAB
    activity .", 'In addition, it has been recorded that berberine suppresses the
    MMP-1 and MMP-9 expression .', "Interesting data are available about anti-metastatic
    properties shared by several grape components, such as proanthocyanidins and epigallocatechin,
    both of which inhibit matrix MMPs release in human prostate carcinoma cells, hindering
    thereafter MAPK and NF-\u03BAB pathways .", Accumulating evidence has suggested
    that MMP-2 and MMP-9 activities are highly correlated with breast cancer cell
    invasion ., 'Thus, agents that could affect them and down-regulate their activity
    are warranted.', 'Indeed, in our study, we demonstrated that GSE at low concentration
    inhibited MMP-2 and MMP-9 activities, respectively, after 24 and 48 h of treatment,
    contributing to decrease the invasive power of MDA-MB231 breast cancer cells.',
  'It has been reported that matrix MMPs, like MMP-2 and MMP-9, may be activated by
    uPA , which is also capable of degrading members of the matrix proteins, such
    as fibronectin, collagen and laminin by itself .', We demonstrated that GSE-treated
    cells showed a significant decrease in uPA activity after a 24-h treatment with
    respect to control conditions., "As a result, MDA-MB231 cells invaded the Matrigel
    layer significantly less than the control cells after 24 h. Therefore, it seems
    likely that uPA inhibition could lead to a \u201Cmatrix-protective\u201D effect.",
  'MMPs and uPA are primarily regulated at transcriptional and post-transcriptional
    levels and at the protein level through their activators and inhibitors, and at
    cell surface localization .', "Transcription of MMPs and the uPA is regulated
    by upstream sequences, including motifs corresponding to NF-\u03BAB, AP-1 or SP-1
    binding sites .", "NF-\u03BAB is involved in numerous pathological processes,
    such as inflammation, cancer cell adhesion, invasion, metastasis and angiogenesis
    .", "In this study, we found that GSE significantly decreased NF-\u03BAB levels
    after 48 h of treatment, even though its localization was not affected by GSE
    treatment.", "Moreover, recent researches demonstrated a strong link among NF-\u03BAB,
    MMPs, uPA and fascin, a new key player in tumour metastasis .", Fascin is a highly
    conserved actin-bundling protein that localizes to microspikes and filopodia and
    functions in cell adhesion and motility ., 'It was reported that fascin is over-expressed
    in large numbers of metastatic cancers, including gastric, breast, colon and ovarian
    .', 'In our experiments, fascin expression resulted heavily down-regulated in
    GSE-treated samples, indicating that treated cells showed less motility than those
    of control conditions.', 'This result was confirmed by the migration assay, which
    evidenced how the incubation with low concentration of GSE induced MDA-MB231 cells
    to migrate less than untreated cells.', "Lately it was reported that fascin expression
    correlates with the presence of \u03B2-catenin in the nuclei of cells .", "Thus,
    we determined the \u03B2-catenin localization in MDA-MB231 cell line.", "GSE-treated
    cells showed a cytoplasmic and cortical localization of \u03B2-catenin, with respect
    to control cells that exhibited this protein mainly in the nuclei and at perinuclear
    level.", "We also valued \u03B2-catenin expression and we observed that a 48-h
    treatment with GSE significantly reduced the expression of this protein.", "\u03B2-catenin,
    central effector of the Wnt signaling pathway, is involved in several developmental
    and homeostatic processes .", "Imbalance in the structural and signaling properties
    of \u03B2-catenin often results in an inappropriate nuclear accumulation of this
    protein and consequently causes disease and deregulated growth connected to cancer
    and metastasis .", "Conversely, in the cytoplasm, \u03B2-catenin is normally short-lived:
    it is recognized by the destruction complex and rapidly targeted for degradation.",
  The fact that the extract induces a translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm
    and cortical level of the protein represents a further confirmation of the decrease
    in the metastatic potential faced by the tested cell line following treatment.,
  'In conclusion, this study showed that GSE may differently affect different metastatic
    pathways, depending on the GSE concentration.', 'High GSE concentration triggered
    proliferation arrest and apoptosis; on the contrary, low GSE concentration failed
    to induce growth inhibition or cell death, otherwise influencing migration and
    invasion processes.', 'GSE inhibited the cellular migration of MDA-MB231: that
    inhibition is likely to be mediated by a reduction in fascin expression, a CSK-related
    protein.', 'Indeed, MDA-MB231 cells, once incubated with GSE, exhibited a less
    invasivity that should be ascribed, at least in part, to the inhibited activity
    of uPA, MMP-2 and MMP-9.', 'Overall, these results suggest that GSE could be thought
    a powerful candidate for developing preventive agents against cancer metastasis.',
  'Indeed, despite the availability of selected treatment options for breast cancer
    therapies, yet a natural product like GSE may be a promising adjuvant, able to
    amplify response obtained with conventional pharmacological cares.', "High GSE
    concentrations are likely to induce cancer cells apoptosis indeed; meanwhile,
    sub-lethal GSE doses might inhibit the metastatic cascade affecting MMPs, uPA
    and cytoskeletal factors as \u03B2-catenin and fascin.", 'Therefore, a clinical
    target-oriented study to examine the anticancer effect of GSE is urgently warranted.',
  "We are grateful to Dr. D. Antonacci for providing the grape seed extract, and to
    professors G. Pasqua and A. Lagan\xE0 for chemical characterization of the extract.",
  'On behalf of all authors, the corresponding author states that there is no conflict
    of interests.']
