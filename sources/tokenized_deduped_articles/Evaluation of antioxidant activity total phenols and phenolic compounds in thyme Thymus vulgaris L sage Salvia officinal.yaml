['The antioxidant properties and total phenolic of different extracting solvents of
    thyme, sage, and marjoram were examined using the stable 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl-hydrate
    free radical scavenging method and Folin-Ciocalteu method, respectively.', 'Methanol
    exhibited the highest extraction ability for such phenolic compound, where the
    total phenols were 8.10, 5.95, and 5.20 for thyme, sage, and marjoram, respectively
    and also exhibited the strongest antioxidant capacity.', 'On the basis of the
    results obtained, thyme, sage, and marjoram have a potential use as natural antioxidants
    due to their significant antioxidant activity.', 'HPLC analysis of methanolic
    extract showed the presence of: rosmarenic acid, methyl rosmarenate, caffeic acid,
    cinnamic acid, chlorogenic acid and quinic acid as phenolic acids, besides some
    flavonoids such as ferulic acid, apigenin, luteolin and quercetin.', "The results
    demonstrated that thyme methanol extract possessed the best antioxidative activity,
    which were better than those of other plants, \xCE\xB1-tocopherol and BHA."]
