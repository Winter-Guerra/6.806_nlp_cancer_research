['The chemopreventive potential of three essential oils, cumin, poppy and basil were
    studied by assessing their effects on the carcinogen detoxifying enzyme, glutathione-S-transferase,
    and on 3,4-benzo(a)pyrene induced neoplasia in Swiss mice.', 'Cumin, poppy and
    basil oils significantly increased glutathione-S-transferase activity by more
    than 78% in the stomach, liver and oesophagus of Swiss mice--high enough to be
    considered as protective agents against carcinogenesis.', Glutathione levels were
    also significantly elevated in these three tissues., 'The essential oils from
    cumin seeds, poppy seeds and basil leaves significantly inhibited benzo(a)pyrene
    induced squamous cell carcinoma in the stomach of Swiss mice.', These three oils
    therefore show great promise as chemopreventive agents.]
