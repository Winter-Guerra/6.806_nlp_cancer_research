[The antioxidant and radioprotective effects of the phenolic glycosides from Capsicum
    annuum L. were examined., 'There were: sinapoyl-E-glucoside, quercetin-3-O-rhamnoside-7-O-glucoside,
    quercetin-3-O-rhamnoside and luteolin-7-O-(2-apiosyl)-glucoside.', 'To the best
    of our knowledge, this is the first study to assay these compounds for their radioprotective
    effect on human cell lymphocytes in response to oxidative damage induced by X
    radiation and their antioxidant abilities.', 'Investigated compounds showed weaker
    antiradical activities, but their radioprotective potentials were higher than
    those of their aglycones.', Quercetin-3-O-rhamnoside showed the highest radioprotective
    activity., 'Furthermore, quercetin and luteolin derivatives, in contrast to free
    aglycones, were not cytotoxic against human lymphocytes for all concentrations
    tested.', "The best correlation between radioprotective and antiradical activities
    of the investigated compounds was observed in the relationship to O2\u2212 generated
    using the NADH/PMS method.", 'Thus, we propose that superoxide radical scavenging
    activity is a useful method for screening for compounds with promising radioprotective
    potential.']
