['There are a number of dietary interventions capable of inhibiting mammary tumorigenesis;
    however, the effectiveness of dietary combinations is largely unexplored.', 'Here,
    we combined 2 interventions previously shown individually to inhibit mammary tumor
    development.', 'The first was the use of the omega-3 fatty acid, eicosapentaenoic
    acid, and the second was the implementation of calorie restriction.', 'MMTV-Her2/neu
    mice were used as a model for human breast cancers, which overexpress Her2/neu.',
  Six groups of mice were enrolled., 'Half were fed a control diet with 10.1% fat
    calories from soy oil, whereas the other half consumed a diet with 72% fat calories
    from EPA.', 'Within each diet, mice were further divided into ad libitum, chronic
    calorie-restricted, or intermittent calorie-restricted groups.', 'Mammary tumor
    incidence was lowest in ICR-EPA and highest in AL-Con mice, whereas AL-EPA, CCR-Con,
    CCR-EPA, and ICR-Con groups had mammary tumor incidence rates of 63%, 47%, 40%,
    and 59%, respectively.', Survival was effected similarly by the interventions.,
  Consumption of EPA dramatically reduced serum leptin and increased serum adiponectin
    in the AL-EPA mice compared with AL-Con mice., Both CCR and ICR decreased serum
    leptin and insulin-like growth factor I compared with AL mice but not compared
    with each other., These results illustrate that mammary tumor inhibition is significantly
    increased when ICR and EPA are combined as compared with either intervention alone.,
  This response may be related to alterations in the balance of serum growth factors
    and adipokines., "Cancer Prev Res; 6(6); 540\u20137.", "\xA92013 AACR."]
