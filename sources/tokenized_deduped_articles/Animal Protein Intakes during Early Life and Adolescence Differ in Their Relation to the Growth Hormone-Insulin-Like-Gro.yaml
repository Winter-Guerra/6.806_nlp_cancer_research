[Recent studies provide evidence that insulin-like-growth-factor I and its binding
    proteins IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-3 are related to the risk of several common cancers.,
  It remains to be clarified whether their concentrations can be programmed by protein
    intake from different sources during growth., 'This study addressed the hypothesis
    that animal protein intakes during infancy, mid-childhood, and adolescence differ
    in their relevance for the growth-hormone-IGF-I axis in young adulthood.', 'Data
    from the Dortmund Nutritional and Anthropometric Longitudinally Designed Study
    participants with at least 2 plausible 3-d weighed dietary records during adolescence,
    around the adiposity rebound or early life, and one blood sample in young adulthood
    were included in the study.', 'Mean serum concentrations of IGF-I, IGFBP-1, IGFBP-2,
    and IGFBP-3 were compared between tertiles of habitual animal protein intake using
    multivariable regression analysis.', 'Habitually higher animal protein intakes
    in females during puberty were related to higher IGF-I and IGFBP-3 and lower IGFBP-2,
    but not to IGFBP-1 in young adulthood.', 'In turn, IGF-I concentrations in young
    adulthood were inversely related to animal protein intakes in early life among
    males only, but not to animal protein intake around adiposity rebound.', 'Our
    data suggest that, among females, a habitually higher animal protein intake during
    puberty may precipitate an upregulation of the GH-IGF-I axis, which is still discernible
    in young adulthood.', 'By contrast, among males, higher animal protein intakes
    in early life may exert a long-term programming of the GH-IGF-I axis.']
