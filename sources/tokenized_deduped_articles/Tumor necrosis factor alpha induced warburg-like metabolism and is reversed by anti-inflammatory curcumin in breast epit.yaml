[The reprogramming of cellular metabolism in cancer cells is a well-documented effect.,
  It has previously been shown that common oncogene expression can induce aerobic
    glycolysis in cancer cells., 'However, the direct effect of an inflammatory microenvironment
    on cancer cell metabolism is not known.', 'Here, we illustrate that treatment
    of nonmalignant and malignant breast epithelial cells with low-level tumor necrosis
    factor alpha significantly increased glycolytic reliance, lactate export and expression
    of the glucose transporter 1.', "TNF-\u03B1 decreased total mitochondrial content;
    however, oxygen consumption rate was not significantly altered, suggesting that
    overall mitochondrial function was increased.", "Upon glucose starvation, MCF7
    cells treated with TNF-\u03B1 demonstrated significantly lower viability than
    nontreated cells.", 'Interestingly, these properties can be partially reversed
    by coincubation with the anti-inflammatory agent curcumin in a dose-dependent
    manner.', This work demonstrates that aerobic glycolysis can be directly induced
    by an inflammatory microenvironment independent of additional genetic mutations
    and signals from adjacent cells., 'Furthermore, we have identified that a natural
    dietary compound can reverse this effect.', An emerging hallmark of cancer is
    the reprogramming of cellular energetic pathways., 'Virtually all cancers have
    been shown to upregulate glycolysis and lactate production, even in the presence
    of oxygen, a phenomenon referred to as aerobic glycolysis or the Warburg effect.',
  It has been shown that expression of the oncogenes c-Myc and Akt can induce aerobic
    glycolysis., 'In addition, aerobic glycolysis can be induced by inflammatory gene
    expression in adjacent cancer-associated fibroblasts, which affect cancer cell
    metabolism by shuttling lactate, ketones and glutamine to the cancer cells.',
  'However, the direct effect of an inflammatory microenvironment on reprogramming
    of energetic pathways is less understood.', 'Although several mechanisms for inflammation-induced
    tumorigenesis have been studied, there are relatively few reports on the role
    of chronic inflammation in the reprogramming of cancer cell metabolism.', Indirect
    evidence supports that this may be an important mechanism of inflammation-induced
    tumorigenesis., 'It has recently been shown that nuclear factor kappa B, a central
    regulator of the inflammatory response, is also a key regulator of energy homeostasis
    and aerobic glycolysis in mouse embryonic fibroblasts.', Chronic inflammation
    has also been associated with alterations in mitochondrial metabolism., 'Together,
    these data suggest that chronic inflammation may cause tumorigenesis in part,
    through alteration of the balance between aerobic glycolysis and oxidative mitochondrial
    metabolism.', Many natural compounds have been investigated as anticancer agents
    because of their anti-inflammatory properties., 'Curcumin, the bioactive component
    of the spice, tumeric, is a nontoxic compound that has been shown to inhibit the
    growth of human breast cancer cells in vitro, mammary carcinogenesis in vivo and
    breast metastases to the lung in immunodeficient mice.', "Curcumin is thought
    to inhibit phosphorylation of the inhibitor of kappa B, thereby preventing nuclear
    translocation of inflammation-related transcription factor, NF\u03BAB.", 'Together,
    these studies suggest that aerobic glycolysis in cancer cells could be partly
    controlled by the balance of inflammatory and anti-inflammatory agents.', "In
    this study, we investigated the effect of low levels of the inflammatory cytokine,
    TNF-\u03B1, along with the anti-inflammatory agent curcumin on aerobic glycolysis
    and mitochondrial metabolism, in the breast epithelial cell lines, MCF-10A and
    MCF 7.", Nonmalignant and malignant breast epithelial cells from ATCC were maintained
    under standard cell-culture technique., "Cells were treated with either DMSO or

    cytochrome C or GLUT1 antibody at 1:200 dilution overnight.", 'Secondary AlexaFluor633
    or AlexaFluor488 antibodies were applied in 1:200 dilution.', Confocal microscopy
    was performed using ZEN., 'To verify increased mitochondrial content, cells were
    treated and stained with Mitotracker 200 nM and imaged as described earlier.',

    while TNF-\u03B1-treated MCF-7 cells showed significant NF\u03BAB activation,
    which was partially rescued by curcumin at 24-hr posttreatment.", Aerobic glycolysis
    is a phenomenon that has been demonstrated in nearly all cancer types., Previous
    studies have shown that expression of common oncogenes can induce aerobic glycolysis.,
  'Inflammatory gene expression signature in CAFs has also been shown to have an effect
    on cancer cell metabolism; however, the direct effect of an inflammatory microenvironment
    on the metabolism of cancer cells is not known.', Our study identified a microenvironmental
    factor as a direct inducer of aerobic glycolysis and inhibitor of mitochondrial
    biosynthesis in malignant and nonmalignant breast epithelial cell lines., It is
    striking that a tumor-like metabolism can be activated in nonmalignant cells by
    an extracellular signal in the absence of oncogene expression., 'This suggests
    that this emerging Hallmark of Cancer may be activated early in tumorigenesis,
    possibly before the occurrence of mutations.', 'Further investigations are needed
    to determine if this metabolic switch occurs early in tumorigenesis in vivo, because
    this may have implications for the detection of premalignant tissue through increased
    uptake of F18FDG.', The results generated in premalignant breast cells might also
    have implications for breast cancer prevention., "We demonstrated that curcumin
    can return elevated glycolytic levels induced by TNF-\u03B1 to those in control
    MCF-10a cells.", "We also demonstrated that curcumin can prevent the TNF-\u03B1-induced
    drop in mitochondrial content, while combination omega 3 fatty acids do not have
    the ability of such rescue.", 'Certainly, the use of curcumin as a therapeutic
    agent is confounded by its vast biological activity, much of which remains unelucidated.',
  Further studies are needed to determine if curcumin affects inflammation-induced
    aerobic glycolysis in vivo., "The effects of TNF-\u03B1 on the metabolism of malignant
    cells also have significant implications.", Our study demonstrates that microenvironmental
    factors such as inflammation can exacerbate aerobic glycolysis in malignant cells.,
  'Furthermore, this effect can be reversed with the natural dietary compound, curcumin.',
  'These observations are noteworthy, because they demonstrate that the phenomenon
    of aerobic glycolysis may be more plastic than previously recognized.', The Warburg
    effect in cancer metabolism primarily focuses on the increase in aerobic glycolysis.,
  'Because of this focus, it is a common misconception that cancer cells upregulate
    aerobic glycolysis at the expense of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation.',
  "The current study demonstrates that TNF-\u03B1 increases glucose uptake and aerobic
    glycolysis, yet oxygen consumption remains the same.", 'Interestingly, mitochondrial
    content is significantly decreased, indicating that the remaining mitochondria
    are functioning at a higher capacity to compensate for the loss of mitochondrial
    content.', 'This observation is interesting in light of other reports that demonstrate
    that c-Myc can induce aerobic glycolysis and increase mitochondrial function,
    independent of mitochondrial mass.', 'These observations suggest that induction
    of aerobic glycolysis, whether it occurs by oncogene expression or microenvironmental
    factors, may increase overall mitochondrial function.', 'This work uniquely identifies
    a microenvironmental factor, low-level inflammation, as a modulator of energy
    homeostasis in malignant and nonmalignant breast cells.', 'Interestingly, many
    of the alterations of energy homeostasis can be reversed by the addition of curcumin
    but not other anti-inflammatory agents such as omega 3 fatty acids.', "Although
    treatment with curcumin at 5 or 10 \u03BCM reversed much of the TNF-\u03B1-induced
    effects, 5 \u03BCM curcumin was the most consistent rescuing treatment.", This
    demonstration that energy metabolism can be modified through a balance of inflammatory
    and anti-inflammatory agents provides evidence of a more adaptable model of energy
    homeostasis in cancer., We thank the University of New Mexico Department of Biochemistry
    and Molecular Biology for their assistance in this work.]
