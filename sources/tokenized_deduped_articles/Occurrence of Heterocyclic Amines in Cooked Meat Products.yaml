['Heterocyclic amines, potent mutagens and a risk factor for human cancers, are produced
    in meats cooked at high temperature.', The aim of this study was to determine
    the HCA content in cooked meat products prepared by various cooking methods that
    are preferred by U.S. meat consumers., 'The primary HCAs in these samples were
    PhIP, MeIQx, and DiMeIQx.', Type and content of HCAs in cooked meat samples were
    highly dependent on cooking conditions., The total HCA content in well-done meat
    was 3.5 times higher than that of medium-rare meat., Fried pork had higher levels
    of total HCAs than fried beef and fried chicken., 'Among the samples, fried bacon
    contained the highest total HCA content.']
