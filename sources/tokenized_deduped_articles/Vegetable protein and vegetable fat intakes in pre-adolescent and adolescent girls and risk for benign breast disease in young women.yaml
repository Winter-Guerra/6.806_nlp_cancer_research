    data on a variety of foods., 'Beginning in 2005, women reported whether they had
    ever been diagnosed with BBD that was confirmed by breast biopsy.', Logistic regression
    estimated associations between intakes of vegetable protein and fat and biopsy-confirmed
    BBD., Those individual foods that were the largest contributors of protein and
    fat in this cohort were also investigated., "In analyses of intakes from 1996
    through 1998, when our cohort was youngest, vegetable fat, 95 % CI 0.53\u20130.98;

    any one of the foods was associated with lower risk, as was peanut butter.', Girls
    with a family history of breast cancer had significantly lower risk if they consumed

    their race/ethnic group by marking all options that applied to them; most are
    white/non-Hispanic, as are BBD cases.', We computed ages from dates of questionnaire

    assess the potential for selection bias, using baseline data, we compared participants
    who returned the 2005, 2007, and/or 2010 surveys including BBD questions with
    those who did not.', Risk of biopsy-confirmed BBD was the outcome for all analyses.,
  'Logistic regression models, estimated using SAS , provided odds ratios and 95 %
    confidence intervals.', We did not have information regarding month and year when
    cases were diagnosed., 'Because age was related to being diagnosed during follow-up,
    all models adjusted for baseline age along with energy intake.', 'Multivariable-adjusted
    models additionally included age at menarche, childhood adiposity, adolescent
    alcohol intake, and ever pregnant.', 'We first investigated cumulative dietary
    intakes from baseline through 1998, representing the earliest diet available for
    each girl in our cohort, which is appealing because all 112 BBD cases and 6,950
    non-cases are included in these analyses.', 'We also examined dietary intakes
    at age 11, but these analyses had fewer girls as many participants were older
    than 11 at baseline.', 'We further analyzed dietary intakes at age 14, which falls
    within the critical period between menses onset and first pregnancy.', 'We also
    derived intakes separately by menarche status: diet before the onset of menses
    was the cumulative average of intakes from baseline up to the survey before menses
    onset, while post-menses-onset diet was the mean of intakes reported afterward.',
  Our key exposure variables were vegetable protein and fat intakes., 'We further
    determined the greatest contributors to these in our girls, which were peanut
    butter, nuts or peanuts, corn, and beans.', Servings of peanut butter and nuts
    contributed 14 % of the variance in vegetable fat and 20 % of the variance in
    vegetable protein intake in these girls., 'Corn intakes contributed 4 % of the
    variance in vegetable fat and 6 % for protein, while bean intakes contributed
    1 % of the variance in vegetable fat, but 15 % of the variance in protein.', Peanut
    butter is very high in both protein and fat., "Our survey did not specify type
    of nuts, but peanuts have 35\u201340 g/cup of protein and 72-76 g/cup of fat;
    other types of nuts range from 9 g/cup protein to 30\u201333 g/cup protein, and
    fat in other nuts ranges from 62 to 88 g/cup.", 'Beans, soybeans, and lentils
    have high protein contents, but lower fat content, while corn is lower in both
    .', We analyzed the associations between BBD and these foods individually., We
    also analyzed the intakes of these foods combined., 'For contrast, we also considered
    green bean and broccoli intakes as exposures, each very low in protein and in
    fat.', 'Because risk factors for BBD may differ by family history of breast disease,
    we also fit stratified models.', 'Eighty percent of our cohort returned, between
    years 2005 and 2012, at least one of the surveys containing questions about BBD.',
  'Comparing baseline data of these females with the 20 % returning none of those
    surveys, the included girls were slightly younger than those not included, were
    slightly taller, consumed more vegetable protein but less vegetable fat, and more
    beans.', 'However, baseline BMI, energy intake, menarche status, intakes of corn,
    peanut butter, and nuts, and the high protein/fat foods combined were each similar
    for the included and missing females.', These small differences are unlikely to
    present serious sources of bias., 'Table 1 presents mean values at baseline by
    subsequent BBD status of the dietary intake variables of interest, and mean values
    or percentages of potential confounders included in multivariable-adjusted models.',
  'Though some of these factors were not significantly associated with risk for BBD,
    we still include them in our multivariable-adjusted models because they are well-established
    risk factors for breast cancer.', "Characteristics of girls in this study and

    was not associated with risk of biopsy-confirmed BBD, though cumulative vegetable
    fat intake was inversely associated, p = 0.04).", We next investigated those foods
    that were the greatest contributors to vegetable protein and fat intakes in these
    girls., 'Early intake of peanut butter and nuts, and the foods combined, was associated
    with lower BBD risk.', 'Peanut butter intakes were higher than corn intakes, and
    bean consumption was the lowest, so the combined food findings are likely driven
    by peanut butter consumption.', 'Analyses of categorized intakes of peanut butter,
    beans, and corn, individually, provided similar results.', 'The mean age, corresponding
    to the Table 2 analyses of cumulative diet from 1996 through 1998, was 12.8 years.',

    and risk of BBD in young women: dietary intake means by BBD status and odds ratios

    at menarche, adolescent alcohol intake, and pregnancy.", 'The mean age, for the
    cumulative 1996, 1997, and 1998 surveys, was 12.8 years.', "Categorical food analyses

    protein intake was not associated with BBD, though vegetable fat appeared more
    important.", 'At age 11, intake of peanut butter and nuts was inversely associated
    with BBD, p = 0.02), suggesting a 44 % reduction in risk.', 'Investigating diet
    at older ages, analysis of vegetable protein intake at age 14 found a significant
    association with biopsy-confirmed BBD, p = 0.03), though vegetable fat intake
    at age 14 was not associated with BBD.', 'Age 14 intakes of peanut butter and
    nuts were associated with lower risk for BBD, p = 0.02).', 'Corn was marginally
    significant, p = 0.06), while beans/lentils/soybeans were not significant.', Analyses
    of intakes categorized provided similar results., 'Eating any one of these foods
    daily at age 14 was inversely associated with BBD, p = 0.01).', 'Again, the combined
    food findings are likely driven by peanut butter consumption.', "Associations
    between adolescent intakes and risk of BBD in young women: dietary intake means
    by BBD status and odds ratios  \n\n\nWhen dietary variables were not available
    at age 14, values between ages 13.5 and 15.5 were used, and if still missing,
    values obtained from 13.0 to 15.99 year intakes.", 'Multivariable adjustment further
    included age at menarche, childhood adiposity, adolescent alcohol intake, and
    pregnancy ever.', "Categorical food analyses provided similar results: Peanut
    butter and nuts, 1 + serving/(3 days) versus never, OR = 0.51, 95 % CI 0.28\u20130.93;
    Beans, lentils, soybeans 1 + servings/(3 days) versus never, OR = 0.78, CI 0.33\u20131.82;
    Corn 1 + servings/(3 days) versus never, OR = 0.43, CI 0.19\u20130.98\n\nAnalyses
    of cumulative intakes before menses onset provided results similar to those at
    age 11 and to cumulative early diet, while analyses of intakes after menses onset
    provided results similar to those at age 14, though some of the statistically
    significant associations outlined in the above paragraphs became marginally significant.",
  These similarities were expected because dietary intakes at age 11 were highly correlated
    with cumulative intakes before menses onset and intakes at age 14 were also highly
    correlated with intakes after menses onset., "On the other hand, correlations
    between the earlier and later intakes were considerably lower, ranging from \u03C1
    = 0.37 to 0.47, reflecting dietary changes as children go from childhood to adolescence.",
  'We further considered salad dressings, as our surveys asked about low calorie and
    regular calorie separately, but neither was associated with BBD.', 'Only our earliest
    surveys collected data on intakes of seeds because their intakes were so low and
    they were subsequently dropped; seed intake appeared protective, but not statistically
    significant; p = 0.52).', 'Tofu and soy milk intakes were even lower in these
    girls, preventing an analysis of amounts consumed, though girls who ever reported
    drinking soy milk had non-significantly lower risk.', 'To contrast with the high
    protein and high fat foods investigated above, we also considered green beans
    and broccoli, both very low in protein and fat.', 'In spite of reasonable consumption
    levels, we observed no evidence that either green beans or broccoli might lower
    BBD risk.', 'Because our earlier work indicated that some BBD risk factors vary
    by family history , we further investigated diet separately by family history
    of breast disease.', 'Among the 1,199 women with a family history of breast cancer,
    26 were themselves biopsy-confirmed BBD cases and 1,173 were non-cases; apparent
    benefit was suggested for peanut butter and nut consumption at age 14, after the
    onset of menses, and at younger ages, all p ; 0.05.', 'Cumulative early intakes
    of vegetable fat and of the foods combined were significantly associated with
    lower BBD risk, and higher intakes of the foods combined at age 14 were also associated
    with lower risk for BBD among those with a family history of breast cancer.',
  'Among the 4,840 women with no family history of breast cancer or maternal BBD,
    63 were themselves BBD cases and 4,777 were non-cases, all ORs were below 1.00,
    but a significant inverse association was found only for consumption of the foods
    combined after the onset of menses.', 'With our smaller number of cases within
    family history subgroups, power is more limited, yet we still observed the significant
    associations described above.', 'To our knowledge, this is the first investigation
    of vegetable protein and vegetable fat derived from dietary intakes prospectively
    reported by pre-adolescent and adolescent girls, rather than recalled later in
    adult life, and their risk of BBD as young women.', 'Our work suggested that vegetable
    fat consumed by pre-adolescent girls and vegetable protein consumed by adolescents
    may be protective, while peanut butter and nuts, high in both protein and fat,
    consumed at any age may be associated with lower risk for BBD.', 'Our stronger
    findings for peanut butter and nuts, than for corn and beans, may be due to their
    higher levels of consumption in these girls, but peanut butter and nuts also contain
    considerably more protein and fat.', It is also possible that certain foods require
    a longer latency period between exposure and the diagnosis of disease., 'Our findings
    were the strongest among those females whose mother, maternal aunt, or maternal
    grandmother had been diagnosed with breast cancer, though protective effects were
    still suggested for girls with no family history, whose ORs were consistently
    below 1.00 though seldom statistically significant.', 'Girls with a family history
    of breast cancer may have more valid BBD information than those with no family
    history, among whom there may be more undiagnosed cases that appear in analyses
    as non-cases.', All analyses within family history subgroups have less power.,
  'Though we fit a large number of models, they address different age periods and
    thus the participants included sometimes vary among analyses.', 'However, we might
    expect the estimated effects of diet at age 14 to be consistent with effects of
    intakes after menses onset, and they generally were, with vegetable protein more
    important than vegetable fat and peanut butter/nuts and the four foods combined
    important.', 'Similarly, we may expect intakes before menses onset to provide
    conclusions similar to intakes at age 11 and to cumulative early intakes: vegetable
    fat more important than vegetable protein, while peanut butter and nuts and the
    foods combined are still important.', Our findings are reasonably consistent with
    the limited literature on childhood diet and BBD., "Analyses of nurses, who at
    33\u201353 years of age recalled their high school diets, found an inverse association
    between intakes of vegetable fat and nuts and proliferative BBD risk .", Extended
    follow-up of that same cohort found that nuts and peanut butter consumed in high
    school were significantly associated with lower risk of proliferative BBD ., 'Intakes
    of beans and lentils were inversely associated with risk, though not statistically
    significant .', 'Looking instead at breast cancer, studies have implicated high
    total adolescent fat consumption as a risk factor .', 'More compatible with our
    BBD analyses, adolescent intakes of vegetable fat were associated with decreased
    risk of breast cancer .', "Our cohort\u2019s intake of soy products was too low
    for us to investigate, though earlier studies showed a strong inverse relationship
    between childhood soy consumption and risk of breast cancer .", 'Studies of dietary
    intakes in adulthood have not consistently supported associations between diet
    and BBD or breast cancer , but this is not unexpected if childhood or adolescent
    diets provide the critical exposures.', 'However, vegetable fat consumed in adulthood
    was associated with lower risk of proliferative BBD without atypia .', Only olive
    oil consumption was associated with lower breast cancer risk in Spanish women
    ., Trials in mice and monkeys support a relationship between breast cancer risk
    and early-life events including diet ., 'Our food frequency question on nut intakes
    did not specify the types of nuts consumed; however, there is evidence that walnuts
    contain bioactive molecules and phytosterols) that affect mammary epithelial cells
    .', Tree nuts and peanuts are rich in unsaturated fatty acids and other bioactive
    compounds that produce a broad range of metabolic benefits ., 'The longitudinal
    design of this investigation comprises its major strength, as dietary data were
    collected in real time, years prior to the reporting of BBD diagnoses in this
    large cohort of girls from all over the US.', 'Though all models controlled for
    age and energy, and other potential confounders were further included in multivariable-adjusted
    models, with separate analyses stratifying by family history, some residual and
    unmeasured confounding may remain.', 'We cannot exclude the possibility of incomplete
    adjustment or confounding through variables not considered, but little is known
    about childhood risk factors for BBD.', 'Although our cohort is not representative
    of US females, the comparison of risks within our cohort should still be valid
    and generalizable .', 'Because our participants are daughters of nurses, this
    reduces confounding by socioeconomic and other unmeasured factors, while enhancing
    the accuracy of the data.', 'The most serious limitation is our small number of
    cases, though we did obtain significant ORs that were reasonably consistent across
    our analyses.', 'Furthermore, earlier research on this cohort reported significant
    associations between BBD and adolescent alcohol consumption , family history of
    breast disease , and childhood growth variables ; though our study of adolescent
    dairy intakes and BBD was null , this is consistent with the literature.', 'Another
    limitation was the necessity to collect data by self-report, but alternatives
    were not feasible.', 'Dietary intake reporting errors were likely non-differential
    with respect to subsequent BBD, possibly biasing our estimates toward the null.',
  'Some of the dietary variables in our analyses were cumulative averages of intakes
    reported over multiple years, which should reduce measurement error bias in risk
    estimates.', The racial/ethnic makeup of our cohort hinders generalization to
    other races/ethnicities., 'In conclusion, we assessed BBD risk in young women
    in relation to their vegetable protein and vegetable fat intakes recorded during
    pre-adolescence and adolescence, periods previously demonstrated to be critical
    for the development of breast cancer  and other adult diseases.', 'We found evidence
    that vegetable protein and fat intakes, and peanut butter and nuts in particular,
    may help reduce risk for BBD.', 'Older girls may benefit by consuming a variety
    of foods that are high in vegetable protein and fat, including peanut butter,
    nuts, corn, beans, lentils, and soybeans.', 'Because our number of cases was relatively
    small, and because certain dietary factors may require longer latency from exposure
    to development of disease, continued follow-up of this cohort will be critical
    to reassess these results as new cases of BBD are diagnosed.', 'In addition, animal
    models may help refine understanding of pathways and mechanisms, and potential
    prevention strategies.', This study was supported by a grant from The Breast Cancer
