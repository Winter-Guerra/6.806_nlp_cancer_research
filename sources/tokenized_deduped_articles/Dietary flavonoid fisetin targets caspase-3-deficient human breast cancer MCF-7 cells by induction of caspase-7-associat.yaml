['The outcome of producing apoptotic defects in cancer cells is the primary obstacle
    that limits the therapeutic efficacy of anticancer agents, and hence the development
    of novel agents targeting novel non-canonical cell death pathways has become an
    imperative mission for clinical research.', Fisetin is a naturally occurring flavonoid
    commonly found in fruits and vegetables., 'In this study, we investigated the
    potential anticancer effects of fisetin on breast cancer cells.', The result showed
    fisetin induced higher cytotoxicity in human breast cancer MCF-7 than in MDA-MB-231
    cells otherwise it did not exert any detectable cytotoxicity in non-tumorigenic
    MCF-10A cells., 'We found fisetin can trigger a novel form of atypical apoptosis
    in caspase-3-deficient MCF-7 cells, which was characterized by several apoptotic
    features, including plasma membrane rupture, mitochondrial depolarization, activation
    of caspase-7, -8 and -9, and PARP cleavage; however, neither DNA fragmentation
    and phosphotidylserine externalization was observed.', "Although p53 was also
    activated by fisetin, the fisetin-induced apoptosis was not rescued by the p53
    inhibitor pifithrin-\u03B1.", 'In contrast, the fisetin-induced apoptosis was
    abrogated by pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk.', 'Furthermore, inhibition of autophagy
    by fisetin was shown as additional route to prompt anticancer activity in MCF-7
    cells.', These data allow us to propose that fisetin appears as a new potential
    anticancer agent which can be applied to develop a clinical protocol of human
    breast cancers.]
