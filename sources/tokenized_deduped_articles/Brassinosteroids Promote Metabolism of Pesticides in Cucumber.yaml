['Brassinosteroids are known to protect crops from the toxicity of herbicides, fungicides
    and insecticides.', It is shown here that application of 24-epibrassinolide accelerated
    metabolism of various pesticides and consequently reduced their residual levels
    in cucumber., 'Chlorpyrifos, a widely used insecticide, caused significant reductions
    of net photosynthetic rate and quantum yield of PSII in cucumber leaves.', "EBR
    pretreatment alleviated the declines of Pn and \u03A6PSII caused by chlorpyrifos
    application, and this effect of EBR was associated with reductions of chlorpyrifos
    residues.", 'To understand how EBR promotes chlorpyrifos metabolism, the effects
    of EBR on activity and expression of enzymes involved in pesticide metabolism
    were analyzed.', 'EBR had a positive effect on the activation of glutathione S-transferase,
    peroxidase, and glutathione reductase after treatment with chlorpyrifos, although
    the effect on GR was attenuated at later time points when plants were treated
    with 1 mM chlorpyrifos.', 'In addition, EBR enhanced the expression of P450 and
    MRP, which encode P450 monooxygenase and ABC-type transporter, respectively.',
  'However, the expression of GST was consistently lower than that of plants treated
    with only chlorpyrifos.', 'Importantly, the stimulatory effect of EBR on pesticide
    metabolism was also observed for cypermethrin, chlorothalonil, and carbendazim,
    which was attributed to the enhanced activity and genes involved in pesticide
    metabolism.', 'The results suggest that BRs may be promising, environmentally
    friendly, natural substances suitable for wide application to reduce the risks
    of human and environment exposure to pesticides.', Biotic stresses caused by herbivores
    or pathogens lead to major losses in crop productivity worldwide., 'Over the past
    several decades, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which plants
    respond and adapt to biotic stresses has been enhanced drastically, and this burst
    of knowledge has already started to generate innovative approaches in developing
    transgenic resistant crop varieties through manipulation of genes involved in
    plant biotic stress responses.', 'However, the use of pesticides is still the
    most common and effective strategy for controlling pests and for achieving high
    crop yields for a rapidly growing population.', "It is difficult to completely
    imagine the levels and security of today\u2019s yields without the use of synthetic
    pesticides.", An estimated 2.5 million tons of pesticides are used annually in
    the world., The excessive use of pesticide results in pollution to nontarget agricultural
    produces and has raised worldwide concerns on food safety., 'Extensive research
    has focused on bioremediation, which uses microorganisms to break down soil pollutants
    into harmless products.', 'By contrast, there is only very limited information
    about cost-effective strategies that reduce pesticide residues in agricultural
    produces.', Many developed countries have set maximum residue limits for agricultural
    produces., 'To meet these MRLs, many countries rely on optimizing the input and
    timing of pesticide applications.', 'However, these empirical methods, which are
    developed from field and glasshouse trials, may not be very reliable and can fail
    and cause public health problems due to a variety of reasons.', Understanding
    the factors that affect pesticide metabolism can help develop new methods that
    can provide maximal crop protection and cause minimal public health problems.,
  Plants are able to transform pesticides by using a phased detoxification system.,
  "Absorbed pesticides are first metabolically activated by \u201Cphase 1\u201D enzymes,
    such as P450 monooxygenase, peroxidase, and carboxylesterases.", 'The second phase
    involves conjugation to glutathione and glucose catalyzed by glutathione S-transferase
    and UDP-glycosyltransferase, respectively.', The third phase of pesticide metabolism
    is sequestration and storage of soluble metabolites either in vacuoles or in apoplast.,
  The glutathione S-conjugates are actively transported to the vacuoles or apoplast
    by ATP-dependent membrane pumps., It has been shown that overexpressions of endogenous
    plant genes or transgenic expression of bacterial or animal genes can enhance
    pesticide metabolism in many plants., 'However, the upstream mechanisms controlling
    the expression of plant detoxification genes are largely unknown.', Brassinosteroids
    play an essential role in plant growth and development., 'BRs have also been implicated
    in plant responses to environmental stresses and in plant defense against bacterial,
    fungal, and viral pathogens.', 'However, little is known about the involvement
    of BRs in plant responses to organic pollutants such as pesticides.', 'We have
    previously shown that exogenous application of BRs reduced the phytotoxic effect
    of herbicides, fungicides, and insecticides on cucumber leaves.', 'In addition,
    BRs can reduce the damage caused by simazine, butachlor, or pretilachlo in rice.',
  'How BRs reduce the toxicity of various pesticides, however, is unclear.', 'On the
    basis of their effects on the toxicity of pesticide, BRs can be considered as
    safeners, which are known to induce the activity of numerous plant P450s and enhance
    glutathione conjugation involved in the biodegradation of herbicides.', 'Indeed,
    Hatzios and Burgos have previously suggested that plant hormones are involved
    in the induction of plant defense and detoxification genes in response to pesticides.',
  'Furthermore, transcriptional analyses of BR-deficient or BR-treated Arabidopsis
    and cucumber plants have shown that BR-regulated genes include those pesticide
    detoxification genes encoding P450 monooxygenase, glutathione S-transferase, and
    UDP-glycosyltransferase.', Here we showed that application of 24-epibrassinolide
    accelerated the degradation of various fungicides and insecticides and that this
    effect was associated with the enhanced expression of detoxification genes., "These
    results strongly suggest that BRs enhance plant tolerance to pesticides by modulating

  'With the increasing use of CPF, it is of great importance to understand its physiological

    in the range of 0.5\u22121 mM causes a 38\u221261% decrease in net photosynthetic
    rate.", The higher concentrations of CPF resulted in further but marginal declines
    in Pn., The maximum quantum yield of PSII decreased almost linearly with increasing
    concentrations of CPF., Changes in the quantum yield of PSII and photochemical
    quenching coefficient were similar to that of Pn after treatments of various concentrations
    of CPF., 'Consistent with our previous results, pretreatment of EBR alleviated
    the inhibitory effect of CPF on photosynthesis.', "EBR pretreatment did not completely
    prevent the decline of Fv/Fm, \u03A6PSII, or qP after CPF treatment; however,
    for all of these photosynthetic parameters, the concentration response curves
    showed partial effects of EBR pretreatment following treatment of 0.5\u22122 mM
    CPF.", Figure 1., "Effects of EBR pretreatment on the concentration response or
    time course of Pn, Fv/Fm, \u03A6PSII, and qP after CPF treatment.", "Data are
    means \xB1 SD.", The magnitude of CPF-induced toxicity in cucumber was further
    determined by assaying the recovery of photosynthesis after 1 mM CPF treatment.,
  'After a dramatic repression by CPF, the Pn started to recover 3 days after CPF
    treatment.', The Pn increased steadily and recovered to the normal value at 7
    days post-treatment., "Three days after CPF treatment, the Fv/Fm, \u03A6PSII,
    and qP also gradually increased.", "The Fv/Fm recovered to the normal value at
    7 days after treatment, whereas \u03A6PSII and qP were completely recovered at
    9 days after CPF treatment.", EBR pretreatment promoted recovery of all these
    photosynthetic parameters., The Pn of EBR-pretreated plants recovered to control
    value at 5 days after CPF treatment., "Fv/Fm increased to control level as early
    as 3 days, and \u03A6PSII and qP recovered close to the control values at 5 days
    after CPF treatment.", The results indicated that EBR could alleviate CPF toxicity
    and promote recovery from CPF-inflicted injury., 'To determine whether difference
    in tolerance to CPF was related to changes in CPF metabolism, plants with or without
    EBR pretreatment were treated with increasing concentrations of CPF and the residues
    were determined at 24 h after treatment.', The residues of CPF steadily increased
    with increased CPF concentration., 'Importantly, EBR pretreatment reduced the
    CPF residue at all of the CPF concentrations applied, and the effect was most
    pronounced with 4 mM CPF.', Time course analysis of CPF residue was also performed
    after treatment with 1 mM CPF., The CPF residues in plants without EBR pretreatment
    were generally higher than those in EBR-pretreated plants., Notably the CPF residues
    of EBR-pretreated plants fell below the maximum residue limits set by China at
    9 days when the values of plants without EBR pretreatment were still 60% higher
    than the limit., We found a close relationship between the CPF residue and the
    net photosynthetic rate., This suggested that EBR reduced the negative effects
    of CPF on plant photosynthesis by enhancing the dissipation of the pesticide.,
  Figure 2., Effects of EBR pretreatment on the pesticide residues after treatment
    with different concentrations of CPF and dissipation of CPF., "Data are means
    \xB1 SD.", The effects of CPF on enzymes involved in detoxification pathways were
    determined., Treatment with 0.5 mM CPF did not have a significant effect on GST
    activity., 'A significant increase in GST activity was observed in plants treated
    with 1 or 2 mM CPF, but application of a high CPF concentration led to a reduction
    of GST activity.', POD activity showed a concentration-dependent increase from
    1 to 4 mM CPF., GR activity was increased even by treatment of 0.5 mM CPF and
    was further elevated by higher concentrations of the pesticide., 'In EBR-pretreated
    plants, induction of GST and POD activities was observed even with treatment of
    0.5 mM CPF, suggesting that EBR increases the sensitivity of plants to CPF for
    induction of these enzymes.', 'In addition, CPF-induced activities of GST, POD,
    and GR were generally higher in EBR-pretreated plants than in unpretreated plants.',
  Figure 3., 'Effects of EBR pretreatment on the concentration response or time course
    of GST, POD, and GR activities after CPF treatment.', "Data are means \xB1 SD.",
  The time courses of the activities of detoxification enzymes after 1 mM CPF treatment
    were also measured., 'The highest activity of GST was observed at 3 days, and
    the activity gradually declined to control levels at 9 days after treatment, the
    last time point for the experiment.', POD activity steadily increased from 1 days
    and reached a plateau by 5 days., 'GR activity increased 2- and 4-fold at 3 and
    5 days after treatment, respectively.', 'After reaching peak activity at 5 days,
    GR activity gradually declined but was still higher than the control at the end
    of the experiment.', 'Pretreatment with EBR did not alter the time course of GST
    and POD induction, but significantly enhanced their activities when compared with
    those of unpretreated plants.', 'On the other hand, in EBR-pretreated plants,
    CPF induction of GR activity was faster, although the induced activity was somewhat
    lower at later time points than that of unpretreated plants.', Enhanced induction
    of detoxification enzymes by EBR may contribute to the enhanced dissipation rate
    of CPF in EBR-pretreated plants., 'To investigate the molecular mechanism of EBR-enhanced
    CPF dissipation, we analyzed the gene expressions of P450, GST, and MRP, which
    encode proteins involved in pesticide conversion, conjugation, and transport,
    respectively.', The expressions of P450 and GST were not correlated linearly with
    the applied CPF concentrations., 'Expressions of P450 and GST were significantly
    induced by 0.5 mM CPF, but only slightly induced by higher CPF concentrations.',
  'At 4 mM CPF, however, the transcripts of P450 and GST were again significantly
    increased relative to that of untreated control.', 'In comparison, the expression
    of MRP increased almost linearly with increasing concentrations of CPF and transcript
    level after treatment of 4 mM CPF increased to 200% of control levels.', "Consistent
    with the roles in CPF dissipation, EBR pretreatment significantly increased the
    induction of P450 by 0.5\u22122 mM CPF.", 'However, this effect of EBR was not
    observed when the concentration of CPF was increased to 4 mM.', 'In the absence
    of CPF, EBR significantly increased the expression of GST.', 'With CPF treatment,
    however, the transcript level of GST in EBR-pretreated plants was significantly
    lower than that in unpretreated plants.', 'On the other hand, EBR enhanced induction
    of MRP by all four concentrations of CPF applied.', Figure 4., 'Effects of EBR
    pretreatment on the concentration response or time course of P450, GST, and MRP
    expression after CPF treatment.', "Data are means \xB1 SD.", The time course analysis
    of gene expression after 1 mM CPF treatment was also performed., The expression
    of P450 showed the largest increase at 3 days and then gradually declined below
    the control level., The expression of GST was induced 1.5-fold at 3 days and remained
    induced for another 4 days before declining to the control level by 9 days after
    CPF treatment., The expression of MRP was significantly induced during the first
    7 days but was markedly induced at 9 days after CPF treatment., EBR-pretreated
    plants showed greater induction of P450 and MRP by CPF at most of the time points
    than plants without EBR pretreatment., 'On the other hand, unlike GST activity,
    CPF induction of GST gene expression was significantly inhibited by EBR pretreatment.',
  'To investigate whether EBR-enhanced metabolism of pesticide was specific to CPF,
    we analyzed changes of residue levels of another insecticide and two fungicides.',
  'The pesticides were applied 24 h after EBR pretreatment, and the residues were
    determined 4 days later.', The analysis revealed a strong effect of EBR on pesticide
    degradation., 'The residues of CMT and CBZ in EBR-pretreated plants were 35 and
    34% lower than those in plants without EBR pretreatment, respectively.', 'EBR
    pretreatment had an even greater effect on degradation of TPN, with a &gt;50%
    reduction in the pesticide residue in EBR-pretreated plants relative to that in
    plants without EBR pretreatment.', These results suggest a general role of EBR
    in the metabolism of various pesticides., Figure 5., 'Effects of EBR pretreatment
    on pesticide residues after treatment with CMT, TPN, and CBZ.', "Data are means
    \xB1 SD.", Asterisks indicate a significant difference between plants with or
    without EBR pretreatment., Enhanced activities of detoxification enzymes may again
    be associated with enhanced metabolism of the pesticides in EBR-pretreated plants.,
  'Indeed, GST and POD activities in EBR-pretreated plants were increased significantly
    in response to CMT, TPN, or CBZ when compared with plants without EBR application.',
  GR activity was also increased by EBR pretreatment in response to the application
    of TNP and CBZ but not CMT., Figure 6., 'Effects of EBR pretreatment on the GST,
    POD, and GR activities after treatment with CMT, TPN, and CBZ.', "Data are means
    \xB1 SD.", Asterisks indicate a significant difference between plants with or
    without EBR pretreatment., 'The effect of EBR pretreatment on gene expressions
    of P450, GST, and MRP was also examined when plants were treated with the three
    pesticides.', 'At 5 days after treatment with CMT, TPN, or CBZ, the transcripts
    for P450, GST, and MRP were either below or close to the control levels.', 'By
    contrast, the expressions of the genes after pesticide treatment were all increased
    in EBR-pretreated plants.', Enhanced expression of these genes would likely promote
    pesticide metabolism and consequently reduce the pesticide residues., Figure 7.,
  'Effects of EBR pretreatment on P450, GST, and MRP expression after treatment with
    CMT, TPN, and CBZ.', "Data are means \xB1 SD.", Fungicides and insecticides control
    diseases and insects by inhibiting important biochemical reactions within their
    target organisms., 'However, these compounds may also have consequences on crop
    physiology, such as growth reduction, perturbation of reproductive organ development,
    and alteration of nitrogen and/or carbon metabolism.', 'Here, we showed that chlorpyrifos,
    a broad-spectrum organophosphate insecticide, induced reduction of CO2 assimilation
    and electron transport in cucumber leaves.', 'Although it is not clear whether
    chlorpyrifos directly targets photosynthetic apparatus, changes in Chl fluorescence
    parameters suggest strongly that chlorpyrifos causes perturbations of metabolism
    processes in leaves.', 'Chlorpyrifos also induced significant declines in Fv/Fm,
    which is often associated with oxidative stress.', 'Previous study has suggested
    that insecticides in combination with fungicides cause uncoupling of the photosynthetic
    electron flow from phosphorylation, which would activate pseudocyclic electron
    transport, result in generation of reactive oxygen species in chloroplast, and
    cause damage to the photosystems.', 'The recovery of photosynthesis was observed
    at 3 days after 1 mM chlorpyrifos treatment, indicating that chlorpyrifos did
    not permanently destroy photosynthetic activity.', Pesticide metabolism and transformation
    in plants usually result in less toxic metabolites., The recovery in photosynthesis
    may result from chlorpyrifos detoxification in treated plant leaves., This possibility
    is consistent with the observation that the recovery of photosynthesis was accompanied
    by a decrease of chlorpyrifos residue., EBR decreased chlorpyrifos residues and
    alleviated the toxic effect of chlorpyrifos on photosynthesis., EBR may enhance
    the metabolism of pesticides into less toxic forms., The protective effect of
    EBR may also be attributed to the induction of plant antioxidant capacity., 'However,
    we observed no significant enhancement of activities of antioxidant enzymes in
    EBR-pretreated plants.', The enhanced metabolism of chlorpyrifos was associated
    with EBR-mediated increases in activities of detoxifying enzymes in cucumber.,
  'GST is involved in the detoxification of xenobiotic compounds by covalently linking
    glutathione to hydrophobic substrates, forming less reactive and more polar glutathione
    S-conjugates in plants.', Chlorpyrifos is known to undergo hydroxylation reactions
    and is detoxified by glutathione conjugation in mammals., The observation that
    the activity of GST is induced by chlorpyrifos suggests that plants have a similar
    mechanism for detoxification of chlorpyrifos., 'POD, like GST, is also involved
    in plant response to xenobiotic stress by oxidizing and deactivating chemical
    xenobiotics.', 'It has been demonstrated that ATPA2 and ATP24a genes, which encode
    peroxidases, were regulated by brassinosteroids in Arabidopsis.', 'In this study,
    EBR significantly increased the POD activity in chlorpyrifos-treated plants, supporting
    the importance of BR in plant detoxification pathways.', 'Because POD is a general
    defense enzyme and responds to a variety of environmental stresses, it is possible
    that EBR-mediated induction of detoxification enzymes and chlorpyrifos metabolism
    may be part of a general stress response.', GR is an NADPH-dependent enzyme that
    catalyzes the reduction of oxidized glutathione to GSH., 'In addition, GR is important
    for the maintenance of cellular glutathione pools.', Broadbent et al., demonstrated
    that overexpression of pea gor1 gene resulted in an increase of glutathione pools
    up to 50% in tobacco., The enhanced activity of GR may indirectly contribute to
    the increase levels of GSH and enhance the formation of the GS conjugates of pesticides.,
  'However, we observed that the induction of GR activity was most pronounced in plants
    without EBR pretreatment 3 days after 1 mM chlorpyrifos.', 'In addition to its
    roles in pesticide detoxification, GR also has a central role in oxidative stress
    response.', It is likely that CPF caused greater oxidative stress in plants without
    EBR pretreatment and resulted in higher GR activity., 'In addition to GSH conjugation,
    various enzymes involved in the oxidation, transport, or modification in vacuoles
    or apoplast could be limiting factors for the detoxification of chlorpyrifos.',
  Plant P450 monooxygenases catalyze an oxidative transformation by incorporating
    an oxygen atom into an organic molecule to create a hydroxyl side group., ATP-dependent
    membrane pumps recognize the glutathione S-conjugates and shuttle them into the
    vacuoles or to the apoplast., EBR has significant effects on the expression of
    genes encoding P450 monooxygenase and MRP transporter., Differences in the expression
    levels of P450 and MRP may account for the differences in pesticide residues between
    EBR-treated and untreated plants., Time course analysis of the gene expression
    after chlorpyrifos treatment demonstrated that the induction of P450 preceded
    that of GST and that MRP was the last gene to be markedly induced., This pattern
    of expression may reflect the sequence of events for metabolism of pesticide.,
  'In contrast to the GST activity, we observed that plants treated with chlorpyrifos
    contained a higher transcript level of GST than EBR-pretreated plants.', 'Plant
    GST genes are induced by various stresses, such as Al stress, oxidative stress,
    auxin treatment, and inorganic phosphate starvation.', 'Cucumber is very sensitive
    to chlorpyrifos, and oxidative symptoms are always observed in field trials when
    chlorpyrifos is applied to cucumber.', The oxidative stress induced by chlorpyrifos
    may be also involved in the regulation of GST expression., 'For CMT, TPN, or CBZ
    treatment, however, no obvious oxidative symptom was observed in cucumber.', 'Accordingly,
    the EBR-mediated enhancement of pesticide metabolism was correlated with a higher
    transcript level of GST.', 'It is interesting to note that EBR enhanced the metabolism
    of another three pesticides tested, which is accompanied by induction of detoxification
    enzymes and genes.', The most pronounced difference in metabolism was found for
    chlorothalonil., The results from in vitro study suggest that chlorothalonil is
    detoxified in plants via GSH conjugation., GST catalyzes a wide variety of substrates.,
  The general increase in GST activity in EBR-pretreated plants in response to all
    four pesticides tested confirms that GST plays a role in plant transformation
    of these compounds., 'EBR pretreatment enhances induction of P450, GST, and MRP
    transporter genes, suggesting a coordinated detoxification process.', How BRs
    mediate induction of these genes is currently unclear., The generation of ROS
    is a common event in both pesticide treatment and hormone response., 'Recently,
    we discovered that ROS is involved in BR-induced stress tolerance.', 'Therefore,
    ROS may serve as a signal in modulating pesticide metabolism genes.', 'In addition,
    it is important to identify the intermediate in the biotransformation and determine
    whether the conjugation with glutathione is the limiting step for the metabolism
    of these pesticides.', "Although \u201Corganic farming\u201D may reduce the risk
    of food contamination by pesticides, the acceptance of this approach in developing
    countries such as China has been very slow.", The positive effect of BRs on pesticide
    degradation in crops is intriguing., 'At present, there is no direct evidence
    for harmful effects of BRs on human health.', 'Moreover, BRs have been shown to
    inhibit the growth of human cancer cell lines without affecting the growth of
    normal cells.', 'Therefore, application of BRs may offer a promising approach
    for controlling food safety by reducing harmful pesticide residues.', "BRs, brassinosteroids;
