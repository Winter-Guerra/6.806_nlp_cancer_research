[Epidemiological evidence for the impact of fruit and vegetable intake on breast cancer
    risk among the Japanese populations is scarce., 'The purpose of this study was
    to evaluate the association between fruit and vegetable intake and breast cancer
    risk among 47,289 Japanese women.', The study was conducted under a population-based
    prospective cohort design., Dietary assessment was performed using a validated
    food frequency questionnaire., A Cox proportional hazards regression model was
    used to calculate relative risks and their corresponding 95 % confidence intervals.,
  'During an average of 10.2 years of follow-up, 452 cases of breast cancer were newly
    diagnosed.', 'No association with breast cancer risk was seen for intake of total
    fruits and vegetables, cruciferous vegetables, green-leaf vegetables, yellow vegetables,
    or tomato products in overall or postmenopausal women.', Cruciferous vegetable
    intake was associated with a statistically significant decrease in risk of premenopausal
    breast cancer  and showed a marginally inverse association with ER+ PR+ tumors
    ., 'In contrast, positive associations were seen between intake of total fruits
    and citrus fruits and breast cancer risk in overall and premenopausal women.',
  'However, these associations for fruit were all attenuated with additional adjustment
    for vitamin C intake.', Our results suggest an overall null association between
    total fruit and vegetable intake and breast cancer risk., Intake of cruciferous
    vegetable showed a statistically significant association with a decreased risk
    of breast cancer among premenopausal women., 'In Japan, the incidence of breast
    cancer has continuously and steeply increased over the last three decades, and
    this cancer is currently the most common female cancer, as in Western countries
    .', 'During this period, an approximately 20% reduction in the consumption of
    total fruits and vegetables has been reported .', 'Fruit and vegetables are rich
    sources of various bioactive compounds and micronutrients, such as vitamins, phytoestrogens
    and carotenoids .', These are potentially anticarcinogenic substances for which
    preventive effects against cancer have been proposed ., 'A majority of epidemiological
    evidence does not support an overall preventive association , however, and the
    latest report from the World Cancer Research Fund made no conclusion due to insufficient
    evidence .', "One explanation for the lack of any firm conclusion on the association
    of total fruits and vegetables on overall breast cancer risk might be the possible
    heterogeneity of impact on risk by sub-type of fruit or vegetable, or sub-type
    of breast tumor, such as estrogens\u2014and/or progesterone receptor status.",
  'For instance, mechanisms hypothesized to explain a putative decrease in risk by
    cruciferous vegetables include a hormone-related mechanism , inhibition of cell
    growth, and induction of apoptosis .', 'To date, the impact of consumption of
    total fruit and vegetables in consideration of estrogen and/or progesterone receptor
    status has been reported by several studies , as well as most recently in a large
    pooled analysis  of 20 cohort studies with the baseline data of the Japan Public
    Health Center-based Prospective Study .', 'Although this pooled overall result
    showed a statistically significant inverse association between total vegetable
    consumption and ER-negative breast cancer risk, the study-specific risk estimates
    in JPHC at the baseline survey suggested the opposite direction to that in the
    overall pooled result for 20 studies .', 'However, the baseline survey of JPHC
    asked about information for four fruits and three vegetables and did not involve
    several commonly consumed vegetables in Japan, such as Japanese radish, Chinese
    cabbage, or Komatsuna.', 'Further, in general, commonly consumed vegetables in
    Japan are not the same as those in Western countries .', 'For example, the food
    supply in 2009 was 5 kcal for tomatoes, 11 for onions, and 57 for other vegetables
    in Japan, versus respective values of 21, 9, and 46 kcal.', 'Here, we prospectively
    evaluated the impact of total and subgroup fruit and/or vegetable intake on the
    risk of breast cancer in consideration of ER/PR status among 47,289 Japanese women
    using data from the 5-year follow-up survey of the JPHC with detailed dietary
    information.', We also conducted secondary analyses to assess which specific vegetables
    contribute to the prevention of breast cancer., 'The study population of the JPHC
    study was defined as Japanese inhabitants of 11 public health center areas and
    consisted of two cohorts, with Cohort I launched in 1990 and Cohort II in 1993.',
  Details of the study design have been described previously ., 'The present study
    was approved by the institutional review board of the National Cancer Center,
    Tokyo, Japan.', 'A total of 140,420 subjects were invited to participate in the
    baseline survey, of whom 71,698 were women.', Subjects in the Tokyo-Katsushika
    PHC area were excluded because complete information on cancer incidence were not
    available., 'Three self-reported questionnaires were sent, one each at baseline,
    5-year follow-up and 10-year follow-up.', 'The present analysis was conducted
    in 53,600 women who completed the 5-year follow-up survey questionnaire, which
    covered information on diet in greater detail than that at baseline.', 'We excluded
    those who moved before the start of follow-up or who could not complete follow-up,
    as well as those with a self-reported history of cancer before the start of the
    follow-up.', 'We also excluded women with missing data on total fruit or total
    vegetable intake, or with extreme total energy intake at the 5-year follow-up
    survey.', 'Consequently, 47,289 women were eligible for inclusion in the present
    analysis.', Dietary assessment was done using a validated self-administered food
    frequency questionnaire., 'The 5-year follow-up survey inquired about 138 food
    and beverage items , including 16 fruits and 30 vegetables.', 'We asked about
    the average frequency and portion size in the past year, with nine frequency categories
    ranging from almost never to 7 or more times per day.', 'Standard portions/units
    were specified for each food item, with the three amount choices of small, medium,
    and large.', 'For seasonal fruit and vegetable products, we asked about the frequency
    of intake when in season and calculated the consumption by taking account of seasonal
    length and portion size.', 'The consumption of fruits and vegetables  as well
    as other estimated dietary/nutritional information was calculated with reference
    to the Standard Tables of Food Composition in Japan, Fifth Revised Edition .',
  'Items were classified into several sub-groups, including eight cruciferous vegetables,
    five green vegetables, four carotenoid-rich yellow vegetables, three tomato products
    and two citrus fruits.', 'Nutritional covariates, except alcohol intake, were
    adjusted for total caloric intake using the residual method .', Validity and reproducibility
    of the FFQ for dietary assessment has been evaluated ., Spearman correlation coefficients
    between the FFQ and 14- and 28-day dietary records as the objective standard were
    0.25 for fruits and 0.34 for vegetables among 113 women ., 'Reproducibility was
    evaluated by administering two FFQs one year apart to 108 women, and showed Spearman
    correlation coefficients of 0.50 for fruits and of 0.53 for vegetables .', 'Information
    on other covariates, such as anthropometric and reproductive characteristics,
    smoking status and menopausal status, was also collected using the self-administered
    questionnaire at 5 years and updated in the analysis whenever reasonable information
    was available from the 10-year follow-up survey.', "Breast cancer cases were identified
    through active patient notification from major local hospitals in the study area
    and data linkage with population\u2013based registries, with permission from the
    local governments responsible for the registries.", "Breast cancer cases were
    defined with reference to the Third Edition of the International Classification
    of Diseases for Oncology  as codes C500\u2013509.", 'Eight cases were identified
    by information on death certificates, of which five had no information on diagnosis.',
  Diagnosis was microscopically confirmed for 97 % of all cases., ER and PR status
    were evaluated by either immunohistochemical assay or enzyme-linked immunoassay.,
  The cut-off point for a positive status for ER and PR was defined by clinical estimation
    for medical treatment or was specified by the assay method., 'Subjects were entered
    into the study on the administration date of the 5-year follow-up survey and contributed
    person-time from the 5-year follow-up survey to the date of diagnosis of cancer,
    date of death, date of migration out of the study area, or end of follow-up, whichever
    occurred first.', 'Dates of death were verified through linkage with the registration
    of deaths at the regional public health centers under the control of the Ministry
    of Health, Labour and Welfare.', Dates of migration were verified through linkage
    with residential registries at the regional PHCs., We used multivariable Cox proportional
    hazards regression models to estimate relative risks and 95 % confidence intervals
    with age as a time scale ., "The proportional hazards assumptions were explored
    by Kaplan\u2013Meier curves .", Participants were subdivided into quartiles according
    to consumption of fruits and vegetables., 'The multivariable adjusted model included
    age, height, recent BMI, BMI at age 20 years, smoking status, leisure-time physical
    activity, age at menarche, age at first birth, parity, age at menopause, use of
    exogenous female hormones, alcohol consumption, energy-adjusted intake of isoflavones,
    and use of vitamin C supplementation.', 'We partly performed additional analyses
    with adjustment for energy-adjusted intake of vitamin C.


    We performed an overall analysis as well as stratified analyses by menopausal
    status.', 'p values for trend were tested by creating a continuous variable from
    the median value for each intake of exposure category, which was then included
    in the regression model.', 'For the sub-analyses of ER/PR tumors, RRs were presented
    per 100-g increment in daily intake of each fruit or vegetable.', All analyses
    were performed using the SAS Statistical Package Release 9.1., 'All statistical
    tests were two-sided, and statistical significance was defined as p ; 0.05.',
  'After an average of 10.2 years of follow-up, corresponding to 482,944 person-years,
    452 breast cancer cases were newly diagnosed among 47,289 women.', "Information
    on ER and PR status was available for 224 cases, of which 105 were ER+ PR+, 51
    were ER+ PR\u2212, and 61 were ER\u2212 PR\u2212.", 'The amount of total fruit
    consumed ranged from a mean value of 83 g/day in the lowest quartile to 444 g/day
    in the highest, while the amount of total vegetable intake ranged from a mean
    of 111 g/day in the lowest quartile to 384 g/day in the highest.', 'The following
    food items made a major contribution: mandarin oranges, apples, Japanese radish,
    100 percent apple juice, onions, 100 percent orange juice, carrots, cabbage, and
    100 percent tomato juice.', 'Women with high consumption of total fruits were
    more likely to be older, and have a low recent BMI, early menarche, low prevalence
    of EFH use, no tobacco use, low alcohol consumption, low total energy intake,
    and high isoflavone intake.', 'Women with high consumption of total vegetables
    were more likely to be older, and have a high BMI, late menarche, more children,
    low tobacco use, low alcohol consumption, vitamin C supplementation, low total
    energy intake and high isoflavone intake compared to women with low consumption.',
  We observed a modest positive correlation between fruit intake and vegetable intake.,
  "Subjects characteristics at the study enrolment according to consumption of fruits
    and vegetables in the Japan Public Health Center-based Prospective Study  \n\n\n\n\nFor
    total fruit and vegetable consumption, our results did not provide any substantial
    association with a decreased risk of breast cancer in this cohort .", The corresponding
    result for total fruit intake was 1.35 and that for total vegetable intake was
    1.02., 'By sub-types of fruits and vegetables, we observed no associations for
    cruciferous vegetables, green-leaf vegetables, yellow vegetables, or tomato products

    results by ER/PR tumor subtype were 0.28 and 0.48; text only)., 'In this large
    prospective cohort study among Japanese women, our overall results suggested no
    substantial decrease in the risk of breast cancer with increased consumption of
    total fruits and vegetables.', 'Our results did suggest a positive association
    of total fruit intake and citrus fruit intake with increased risk of breast cancer,
    particularly among premenopausal women, but these results were attenuated by adjustment
    for vitamin C intake.', 'Further, we also observed a substantial preventive impact
    of cruciferous vegetables against breast cancer among premenopausal women, but
    no association between either total or any subgroup of fruit and vegetable intake
    and breast cancer risk among postmenopausal women.', 'With regard to ER/PR breast
    tumors, intake of cruciferous vegetables, in particular Japanese radish, was substantially
    associated with a decreased risk of ER+ PR+ tumors.', "Our results also suggested
    a significant positive association between citrus fruit intake and the risk of
    ER+ PR\u2212 tumors.", 'In contrast, no association with a decreased risk of any
    ER/PR tumor subtype was seen for total fruits, total vegetables, or any other
    subgroup of fruits and/or vegetables.', 'Similar to our present results, previous
    pooled analyses have reported an overall null association for total fruit and
    vegetable consumption .', 'Median total fruit consumption in the present study
    was within the range of median intake in one pooled analysis , while median total
    vegetable intake was within the range of median total vegetable intake .', 'To
    our knowledge, this study is the first large prospective study to investigate
    the association between the intake of fruits and/or vegetables and breast cancer
    risk with consideration of ER/PR subtype in a Japanese population alone.', 'Unlike
    our present results, total vegetable intake was inversely associated with the
    risk of ER-negative breast cancer risk in the pooled study .', The pooled study
    did evaluate the intake of total or cruciferous vegetables and involved baseline
    data in the JPHC., 'However, this baseline data took into account only three vegetables
    and the study-specific risk estimates suggested the opposite direction against
    the pooled result for the 20 studies .', 'Further, the observed favorable impact
    we saw against ER+ PR+ tumors was attributable to the intake of cruciferous vegetables,
    in particular Japanese radish, which was not taken into account in the pooled
    study.', 'Further, consistent with previous results , our results for a substantial
    preventive impact of cruciferous vegetables against overall and ER+ PR+ breast
    cancer was confined to premenopausal women, who had a higher level of endogenous
    female hormones than postmenopausal women.', 'Cruciferous vegetables contain glucosinolates,
    which are hydrolysed to isothiocyanates and indoles.', 'Experimental and epidemiological
    studies suggest their potential to decrease breast cancer risk by inhibiting cell
    growth, inducing apoptosis  and affecting hormonal level through the hormone-
    and/or ER-related mechanism .', Our present results for ER+ PR+ tumors might support
    this hormone-related mechanism., Further epidemiological and experimental studies
    should be conducted in consideration of ER/PR status., "With regard to citrus
    fruits intake, we unexpectedly observed a positive association between citrus
    fruit intake and risk of overall and ER+ PR\u2212 tumors.", "Previous studies
    had reported inverse associations for ER\u2212 , for ER+ , and for both ER+ PR+
    and ER+ PR\u2212 .", 'The results of sub-analyses for ER/PR tumors might be due
    to chance, because of the relatively small number of cases.', "For the overall
    results, however, a recent systematic review of five case\u2013control studies
    \ and a case\u2013control study, the Shanghai Breast Cancer Study , also reported
    an inverse association between citrus fruits intake and breast cancer risk.",
  'Unlike these studies, our results showed a positive association overall.', 'The
    quantity of citrus fruits intake in the highest quartile was 188.5 g/day in our
    study, while that in the highest quintile of the Shanghai study was 30.4 g/day.',
  Our data suggest that citrus fruits intake is correlated with vitamin C intake and
    that women taking supplemental vitamin C had a substantially higher risk than
    women who did not., 'Given these results, the association between citrus fruits
    intake and breast cancer risk might be explained by a U- or J- shaped relationship.',
  'That is, the appropriate amount of citrus fruits intake leads to risk reduction,
    while an extremely high intake might lead to an increased risk of breast cancer
    due to the extremely high dose of vitamin C. The dose-response impact of vitamin
    C on the development of breast cancer requires further research.', The strength
    of our study is its large sample size and prospective population-based cohort
    design., 'Exposure information was collected before diagnosis, ruling out the
    possibility of differential recall bias.', Misclassification of disease was also
    unlikely due to the low percentages of DCN and DCO., 'Given the reasonable validity
    of fruit and vegetable intake, as measured by Spearman correlation coefficients
    between the FFQ and DR , as well as the consistency of the null results in the
    present and previous studies, the overall null association for total fruits and
    vegetables might be factual.', Several limitations should also be noted., One
    limitation is the small number of cases after stratification by tumor subtype
    and/or menopausal status., The lack of statistical power should be considered
    when interpreting the results., 'Dietary and other epidemiological information
    were assessed based on self-reported questionnaires, and measurement error was
    accordingly unavoidable.', 'Although the FFQ-based fruits/vegetables intake was
    calculated using a purpose-developed database , some degree of seasonal, geographical
    and cultivational variation in micronutrient contents in food products might not
    be completely ruled out .', Our observed null association might be attributable
    to non-differential misclassification of exposure in prospective study design.,
  The possibility of uncontrolled confounding and statistical chance finding due to
    multiple testing should also be considered., 'In summary, our results do not support
    that the risk of breast cancer is decreased with increased consumption of total
    or any other subgroup of fruits and vegetables.', 'For premenopausal women, however,
    our results suggest a substantial preventive association between cruciferous vegetable
    intake and breast cancer risk.', We thank all staff members in each study area
