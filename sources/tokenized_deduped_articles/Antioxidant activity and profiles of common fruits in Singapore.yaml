['Thirty-eight types of fruits commonly consumed in Singapore were systematically
    analysed for their hydrophilic oxygen radical absorbance capacity, total phenolic
    content, ascorbic acid and various lipophilic antioxidants.', Antioxidant composition
    and concentration varied widely across different fruits., Many of the tropical
    fruits tested were high in antioxidants., 'Amongst all fruits tested, sapodilla
    had the highest H-ORAC and TPC whilst guava had the highest AA per gram fresh
    weight.', "Papaya, red watermelon and cantaloupe had the highest \xCE\xB2-cryptoxanthin,
    lycopene and \xCE\xB2-carotene per gram fresh weight, respectively.", 'On the
    other hand, durian and mangosteen were high in tocopherols and tocotrienols, respectively.',
  'Based on consumption data, Chinese Singaporeans appear to have a higher intake
    of carotenoids and tocopherols rich fruits compared to the US population.', 'As
    fruits are a rich source of diverse antioxidants, efforts to promote consumption
    of a variety of fruits should be continued for public health benefits.']
