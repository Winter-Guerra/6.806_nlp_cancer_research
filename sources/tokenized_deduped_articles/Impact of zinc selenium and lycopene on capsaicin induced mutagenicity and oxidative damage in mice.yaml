[Capsaicin is employed as a condiment and colorant in the cosmetic and pharmaceutical
    industries., 'Metabolism of capsaicin produces reactive phenoxy radicals, which
    inflict damage to DNA.', 'Micronutrients such as zinc and selenium facilitate
    the expression of tissue repair factors, and lycopene has natural antioxidant
    action.', 'The current study investigated the possible protective role of zinc,
    selenium and lycopene singly and in combination in ameliorating capsaicin induced
    mutagenicity.', 'Fifty four Swiss albino mice received the vehicle, zinc, selenium,
    lycopene alone, capsaicin alone, and capsaicin along with zinc, selenium and lycopene
    in combination by the oral route for 32 days.', 'Animals were killed 24 h after
    the last treatment, and micronuclei formation in bone marrow and peripheral blood
    were assessed.', 'Antioxidant status in plasma, the total protein, nucleic acids,
    and DNA fragmentation was assessed in the liver homogenate.', Capsaicin substantially
    damaged nuclear material and increased oxidative stress., 'Individual therapy
    with lycopene was most effective in reducing micronuclei formation, lipid peroxidation,
    and in augmenting ferric reducing ability of plasma.', This was closely followed
    by zinc and selenium., Zinc protected against DNA fragmentation followed by lycopene
    and selenium., 'The combination therapy was effective over individual treatment
    against DNA fragmentation, micronuclei and malondialdehyde formation.', The combination
    did not exert a substantial benefit over individual therapy in enhancing the total
    antioxidant ability of plasma., The risk of capsaicin induced mutagenicity was
    lowered with the combination by reducing the generation of free radicals and by
    enhancing tissue repair.]
