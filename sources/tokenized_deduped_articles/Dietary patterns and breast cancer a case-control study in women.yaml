['Since dietary habits have been associated with breast cancer, the tested research
    hypothesis was the associations between food patterns, as derived through multivariate
    methods, and breast cancer.', "In a case\u2013control study, Two-hundred and fifty
    consecutive, newly diagnosed breast cancer female patients and 250 one-to-one
    age-matched, healthy controls were studied.", 'A standardized, validated questionnaire
    assessing various socio-demographic, clinical, lifestyle, and dietary characteristics
    was applied through face-to-face interviews.', 'Factor analysis, with principal
    components method, was applied to extract dietary patterns from 86 foods or food
    groups consumption reported by the controls.', Three components were derived explaining
    43 % of the total variation in consumption., 'Component 1 was characterized by
    the consumption of potatoes, red meat and its products, poultry and white meat,
    dairy products, use of margarine/butter in cooking or at the table, consumption
    of sausages, fried food as well as grilled meat or fish; component 2 was characterized
    by the consumption of whole grains, fruits, and vegetables; and component 3 was
    characterized by olive oil and fish consumption.', 'After adjusting for various
    confounders, components 2 and 3 were favorably associated with the absence of
    having breast cancer , while component 1 was not significantly associated with
    the disease.', 'Adherence to healthy dietary patterns seems to be favorable in
    not having breast cancer, among middle-aged women.', 'Breast cancer is the most
    frequently diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death in females,
    worldwide, accounting for 23 % of the total new cancer cases and 14 % of the total
    cancer deaths in 2008.', About half the breast cancer cases and 60 % of the deaths
    are estimated to occur in economically developing countries ., 'With respect to
    diet and breast cancer risk, during the last decades, studies from all over the
    world have evaluated the relationship between specific foods and some of their
    compounds as well as dietary habits with the development of breast cancer .',
  'Among them, alcohol drinking is widely recognized as one of the behaviors most
    consistently associated with breast cancer risk .', 'Moreover, the evidence for
    the World Cancer Research Fund and the American Institute for Cancer Research
    report is suggestive of an increase in breast cancer risk among postmenopausal
    women consuming higher-fat diets as compared with those consuming lower-fat diets
    .', 'Furthermore, soy food consumption seems to be inversely associated with the
    risk of breast cancer among the Asian women , while increased consumption of total
    dairy food but not milk may be also associated with a reduced risk of the disease
    .', 'In contrast, studies that have evaluated the role of red meat and/or processed
    meat and breast cancer risk provide inconsistent results, while the relationship
    between greater fruit and vegetable consumption and reduced risk for breast cancer
    has not been consistently demonstrated .', 'However, it should be noted that the
    majority of previous studies followed the approach of assessing single nutrients
    or food items, instead of assessing dietary patterns.', 'Nevertheless, it is accepted
    that people do not eat isolated nutrients, but they consume meals consisting of
    a variety of foods with complex combinations of micro- and macronutrients.', 'Moreover,
    food-specific analyses in relation to the characteristics of people or incidence
    of a disease share many methodological limitations.', 'Thus, during the last years,
    several investigators in the field of nutritional epidemiology have suggested
    using a holistic dietary approach when exploring its impact on disease prevention,
    giving much attention in pattern analysis .', Two basic methodologies have been
    proposed for assessing dietary patterns in nutrition epidemiology studies., "The
    first one is based on a priori defined \u201Chealthy\u201D dietary patterns.",
  'To measure the level of adherence to these patterns, special indexes have been
    proposed that capture into a single score the magnitude of adherence to the specific
    pattern .', 'The second methodological procedure is based on multivariate statistical
    methods , such as principal components analysis, cluster, or factor analysis.',
  All these methodologies may consider as a posterior techniques and an alternative
    of the use of diet scores., "They have emerged as methods to empirically derive
    dietary patterns and possibly explain nutrient\u2013disease relations .", 'Among
    them, factor analysis is the method most commonly used since it evaluates the
    correlations between all food consumption variables and reveals similarities in
    the habits of people.', 'Afterward, the application of the classical statistical
    methods, like multiple regression analysis, may reveal whether a food or dietary
    pattern is associated with a specific disease like the breast cancer.', 'Therefore,
    following the holistic dietary assessment approach, in the present work, the tested
    research hypothesis was the evaluation of the odds of adherence to certain dietary
    patterns, as derived through factor analysis using the PCA method, among breast
    cancer patients and their age-matched controls .', "This is a case\u2013control
    study with face-to-face interviews with the participants.", "Between November
    1, 2010, and July 31, 2012, 250 consecutive, newly diagnosed breast cancer female
    patients that visited pathology\u2013oncology clinics of five major General Hospitals
    in Athens, Greece, were contacted to participate in the study.", Patients with
    diagnosis older than 6 months were not included., 'In the same period, 250 female
    subjects without any clinical symptoms, signs, or suspicious of any type of cancer
    in their medical history were selected on a volunteer basis.', 'Control subjects
    were age-matched with the cancer patients, population-based, and selected from
    the same catchment area.', The participation rate of the patients was 82 % and
    of the controls was 88 %., "To reduce selection bias, a random selection of the
    controls was performed, when it was possible, e.g., through the employees listings
    of the companies that were visited by the study\u2019s investigators in order
    to enroll controls or the apartments of the building.", "The rest 40 % of the
    controls were selected on a feasibility basis and were colleagues, friends, or
    relatives of the study\u2019s field investigators that fulfilled the aforementioned
    criteria.", 'The number of the enrolled subjects was decided through power analysis
    in order to evaluate odds ratio equal to 1.10, achieving statistical power greater
    than 0.80 at 0.05 probability level.', The design of the study and the analytical
    methods followed have been already described elsewhere ., "The study has been
    approved by the Ethics Committee of \u201CAlexandra\u201D General Hospital, \u201CI.",
  "Metaxa\u201D Special Cancer Hospital, and \u201CSaint Savvas\u201D Cancer Hospital
    and was carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki of the World
    Medical Association.", 'Prior to the collection of any information, participants
    were informed about the aims and procedures of the study and provided their signed
    consent.', 'A validated, semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire was used
    during the interviews to collect dietary information from the participants .',
  'In brief, the FFQ included 86 questions regarding the frequency of consumption
    of all main food groups and beverages usually consumed.', 'Specifically, data
    on regular consumption of each food group were recorded for the last year prior
    to diagnosis.', 'In this work, the interest was focused on food groups, such as
    the consumption of whole grains, potatoes, fruits, greens, vegetables, fish, red
    meat and its products, poultry and white meat, dairy products including milk,
    yoghurt, and cheese, alcoholic beverages, the use of olive oil in cooking, the
    use of margarine or butter in cooking or at the table, as well as the consumption
    of fried food and grilled meat or fish.', 'Adherence to the Mediterranean dietary
    pattern was assessed using the MedDietScore, an 11-item composite dietary index,
    with large-scale scoring that ensures better predictive accuracy .', The range
    of the MedDietScore is between 0 and 55., Higher values of this score indicate
    greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet., The validation properties of the
    MedDietScore have been presented elsewhere in the literature ., 'Age of the participants
    was recorded, as well as their place of living, educational level, and financial
    status.', 'Weight and height were measured using standardized procedures, and
    body mass index was calculated as weight in kg divided by height in m-squared.',
  Physical activity was assessed using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire
    index  that has been validated for the Greek population ., 'Subjects were asked
    to recall the number of days and hours or minutes they were engaged in physical
    activity of different intensities for at least 10 min, vigorous intensity and
    moderate intensity, walking, and time spent sitting.', 'According to their physical
    activity levels, participants were classified as inactive, minimally active, or
    health enhancing physical activity active.', Smoking habits were also recorded.,
  'Family history of breast cancer, gynecological medical history, as well as a detailed
    medical history regarding the common comorbidities and their treatment were recorded
    during the interview.', "Continuous variables that were normally distributed were
    presented as mean \xB1 SD.", "Normality was evaluated using the P\u2013P plots.",
  Categorical variables were presented as frequencies., Associations between categorical
    variables were tested by the calculation of chi-squared test., "Student\u2019s
    t test for independent samples was used to evaluate mean differences of the normally
    distributed variables between cases and controls, where in case of skewed continuous
    variables, the tested hypothesis was evaluated using the nonparametric U test
    suggested by Mann and Whitney.", 'To obtain food patterns, factor analysis with
    the principal components method was applied to the dietary habits of the controls,
    in order to reflect the dietary exposure of the reference population of the case;
    factor loadings were then applied to the patients, as well .', "The PCA explores
    individuals\u2019 eating habits and combines them together into non-correlated
    components based on the level of inter-correlation of their nutritional choices.",
  'At this point, it should be noted that the purpose of PCA was to derive a number
    of independent linear combinations of a set of foods or food groups that retain
    as much of the information of original dietary habits.', 'In the present work,
    from the entire database of the 86 food variables, 14 foods, food groups, and
    beverages were finally used in the analysis, mainly due to their macronutrient
    composition and the fact that they have been previously associated with breast
    cancer.', 'The food variables used had continuous distributions representing times
    per week the food item, group, or beverage were consumed.', "The correlation matrix
    of the food variables used showed that there were several correlation coefficients
    with absolute value &gt;0.4; moreover, the phi coefficient was 0.78, i.e., close
    to 1 which implies high inter-relationships between food variables, and the Kaiser\u2013Meier\u2013Oklin
    criterion was 0.81.", 'Therefore, the factor analysis would be effective for assessing
    meaningful food patterns.', "Normality of food variables was tested using the
    P\u2013P plots; in the case of not-normally distributed variables, the log-transformation
    was used to achieve normality of the distribution.", The orthogonal rotation was
    used to derive optimal non-correlated components., The correlation matrix was
    used for the extraction of the components., The information was rotated in order
    to increase the representation of each food or food group to a component ., 'To
    decide the number of components to retain, the scree plot of the eigenvalues that
    derived from the correlation matrix of the standardized variables was first examined.',
  'According to this criterion, the first three components should be retained.', 'Moreover,
    according to the criterion proposed by Kaiser, i.e., the number of components
    that should be retained is equal to the number of eigenvalues that are greater
    than one, since these components explain more information than the individual
    food variables, it was also concluded that the first three components should be
    extracted here.', 'Based on the principle that the component scores are interpreted
    similarly to correlation coefficients ; thus, higher absolute values indicate
    that the food variable contributes most to the construction of the component and
    the food components were named according to scores of the foods that were &gt;0.4.',
  'Furthermore, conditional logistic regression analysis was applied to evaluate the
    odds of each dietary pattern among breast cancer patients and controls.', 'The
    analysis also accounted for the potential confounding effect of the following
    characteristics: years of education as a proxy of social status, body mass index,
    smoking ever, physical activity, family history of breast cancer in order to encompass
    the genetic predisposition and potential lifestyle changes, menopausal status
    because it has been strongly associated with breast cancer incidence, and place
    of living, a factor that may have influenced their lifestyle behaviors, as well
    as their health status per se.', 'Subgroup analysis by obesity, menopausal status,
    and place of living was applied since multi-adjusting cannot entirely exclude
    residual confounding.', The subgroup analysis accounted for the same potential
    confounders mentioned above., The results are presented as ORs and their corresponding
    95 % confidence intervals., All reported p values were based on two-sided tests.,
  Statistical calculations were carried out using SPSS 18 software., 'In Table 1,
    the basic characteristics of patients and controls are presented.', 'Cases and
    controls were of similar age, while educational and financial status was lower
    in cases as compared to the controls.', Cases were more likely to be overweight
    and have at least one relative to breast cancer., 'There was no significant difference
    in smoking habits, as well as in menopausal status, while cases reported lower
    physical activity status.', 'Finally, regarding the overall quality of the diet,
    the level of adherence to the Mediterranean diet was moderate in both cases and
    controls.', "The MedDietScore is a measurement of adherence to the Mediterranean
    diet, with theoretical range 0\u201355; greater values reporting greater adherence
    to this pattern.", "The reported p values were calculated using the t test, the
    chi-square test, or the Mann\u2013Whitney U test\n\n\n\nAs described above, based
    on the applied factor analysis, three first components that explained the 43 %
    of the total variation in consumption were studied here.", The loadings for the
    three food components that represent the correlation of each food item with the
    corresponding component are presented in Table 2., "Since the higher absolute
    values indicate that the food variable contributes more to the characterization
    of the component , it could be suggested that the extracted components are an
    \u201Cunhealthy\u201D food pattern, which loaded heavily on potatoes, red meat
    and its products, poultry and white meat, dairy products, use of margarine/butter
    in cooking or at the table, consumption of sausages, fried food as well as grilled
    meat or fish; a \u201Chealthy/prudent\u201D pattern that is mainly characterized
    by the consumption of whole grains, fruits, and vegetables; and a pattern that
    represents the consumption of olive oil and fish.", Component 1 was the most dominant
    food pattern and explained 21.5 % of the total variance., Each of the remaining
    2 components explained from 8.2 % to 13.6 % of variance in consumption., 'Regarding
    the other 11 components that explained the rest of the variation in food and beverages
    consumption, none of them was characterized by a specific pattern in consumption.',
  "Moreover, component 1 was inversely correlated with MedDietScore, suggesting that
    women following the \u201Cunhealthy\u201D pattern were not adherent to the Mediterranean
    diet, while component 2 and component 3 were positively correlated with the MedDietScore
    suggesting that women following the \u201Chealthy\u201D pattern as well as the
    pattern characterized by the consumption of olive oil and fish were also adherent
    to the Mediterranean diet.", "Score coefficientsa derived from factor analysis
    regarding foods or food groups consumed by the study participants  \n\n\nDescription
    of the components: Component 1: potatoes, red meat and products, poultry and white
    meat, dairy products, margarine or butter in cooking or at the table, sausages,
    fried food, and grilled meat or fish; Component 2: whole grains, fruits, vegetables;
    and Component 3: olive oil, fish\n\naScore coefficients are similar to the correlation
    coefficients.", 'Higher absolute values indicate that the food variable is correlated
    with the respective component




    Three nested, conditional logistic regression models were estimated in order to
    evaluate the association between each of the extracted dietary patterns and breast
    cancer.', The use of these models assisted in better exploring the potential effect
    of various confounders in the investigated relationship., "Based on the first
    unadjusted models\u2019 1, it was observed that the odds of the food pattern that
    was mainly characterized by the consumption of whole grains, fruits, and vegetables
    was favorable in controls than in the cases, while the food pattern that represented
    the consumption of olive oil and fish was also favorable in controls.", "No significant
    association was observed as regards the \u201Cunhealthy\u201D food pattern.",
  'In the second set of models, years of education as a proxy of social status, body
    mass index, smoking ever, physical activity, family history of breast cancer in
    order to encompass the genetic predisposition and potential lifestyle changes,
    and menopausal status were accounted for.', "The \u201Chealthy/prudent\u201D pattern
    had still lower odds in breast cancer patients as compared to controls, while
    the food pattern that represented the consumption of olive oil and fish was also
    favorable in controls.", "The \u201Cunhealthy\u201D food pattern was again not
    significantly associated with the outcome.", 'In the third nested model, place
    of living was additionally included.', "The beneficial effect of both the \u201Chealthy/prudent\u201D
    as well as the food pattern that represented the consumption of olive oil and
    fish remained unaltered and of their place of living, while the \u201Cunhealthy\u201D
    food pattern was again not significantly associated with the outcome.", "Results
    from conditional logistic regression models that were applied to evaluate the

    and controls  \n\n\nAll odds ratios and their corresponding 95 % CIs were calculated
    by performing conditional logistic regressions\n\nModel 1 was not adjusted; model
    2 was adjusted for the same variables included in model 1 plus years of education,

    status; model 3 was adjusted for the same variables included in model 2 plus place
    of living\n\naSince the 1 unit increase in components\u2019 scores is not meaningful,
    the reader could only evaluate the direction of the effect size\n\n\n\nHowever,
    multi-adjusting cannot entirely exclude residual confounding.", 'Thus, subgroup
    analysis by obesity, menopausal status, and place of living was applied.', "The
    results were similar to the ones presented above; particularly, among normal weight
    women, the \u201Chealthy/prudent\u201D pattern was favorably associated with absence
    of breast cancer, and similarly among overweight women, after adjusting for age,
    educational level, smoking ever, IPAQ score, family history of breast cancer,
    menopausal status, and place of living.", 'However, among obese women, there was
    no significant association with the outcome.', "Moreover, stratified analysis
    by menopausal status revealed similar relationships, since among premenopausal
    and postmenopausal women, the \u201Chealthy/prudent\u201D food pattern was favorably
    associated with absence of the disease, after the same adjustments were made.",
  "At this point, it should be noted that concerning only postmenopausal women, the
    \u201Cunhealthy\u201D food pattern was associated with breast cancer, after the
    same adjustments were made.", "Stratified analysis by place of living revealed
    that the \u201Chealthy/prudent\u201D pattern was favorably associated with the
    absence of the disease in both Athens Metropolitan area inhabitants and among
    those participants who lived in other cities or towns outside the Metropolitan
    area of Athens.", 'In this work, the relationship between a posteriori extracted
    dietary patterns adherence from the dietary reports of healthy women and breast
    cancer was studied.', 'The analysis revealed that the patterns that were mainly
    characterized by the consumption of whole grains, fruits, and vegetables, as well
    as the consumption of olive oil and fish, were favorably associated with absence
    of breast cancer, while the pattern that was mainly characterized by the consumption
    of potatoes, red meat and its products, poultry and white meat, dairy products,
    use of margarine or butter in cooking or at the table, consumption of sausages,
    fried food, as well as grilled meat or fish was not significantly associated with
    the disease.', 'The first two patterns were also positively correlated with an
    a priori defined dietary pattern, the Mediterranean diet, suggesting that the
    a posteriori dietary pattern approach is in accordance with the a priori approach.',
  "However, using a posteriori techniques to identify participants\u2019 eating behaviors
    has several advantages, since this method is inherently capable of overcoming
    methodological issues, such as the high levels of inter-correlation and the synergistic
    effect of foods, and it takes into account the complex way of how people eat as
    well as the possible combinations and interactions among foods and nutrients.",
  'During the past years, dietary pattern analysis has emerged as a complementary
    approach of examining the relationship between diet and the risk of various chronic
    diseases .', 'Instead of looking at individual nutrients or foods, pattern analysis
    examines the effects of the overall diet and represents a broader picture of food
    and nutrient consumption.', 'Furthermore, pattern analysis seems to capture problems
    that can be attributed to the limitations that traditional analyses have both
    in concept and design.', "For example, people\u2019s diet choices include a variety
    of foods and other nutritional habits that may act synergistically or interactively
    on the risk of developing a disease.", 'Moreover, the high level of inter-correlation
    between food variables makes the estimation of the effect size of single foods
    or nutrients in regression models problematic.', 'On the other hand, pattern analysis
    reveals similarities and captures the extremes in food consumption.', 'Moreover,
    as it has been suggested by Newby and Tucker, dietary patterns derived through
    multivariate statistical methods are a sound dietary assessment method and seem
    to be more predictive of disease risk than individual foods or nutrients .', "As
    mentioned above, a posteriori analyses generate dietary patterns on empirically
    obtained information, and thus they do not necessarily create \u201Chealthy\u201D
    patterns, while a priori approaches, using diet indexes, quantitatively measure
    the quality of dietary habits.", 'However, the latter are limited on current knowledge
    about the relationships between diet and health.', "Some other investigators have
    also evaluated dietary patterns in relation to breast cancer using similar multivariate
    techniques and describing similar food patterns like the \u201Chealthy/prudent\u201D
    which tends to have high loadings of foods such as fruits, vegetables, poultry,
    fish, low-fat dairy, and whole grains .", "For example, in a recent case\u2013control
    study conducted among 2,884 cases and 5,509 controls, Buck et al.", using principal
    component analysis identified two major dietary patterns using dietary data collected
    through a 176-item FFQ., "The first pattern that was labeled the \u201Chealthy\u201D
    one was characterized by high vegetable and vegetable oil consumption, while the
    second was labeled as the \u201Cunhealthy\u201D and was characterized by high
    meat and deep-frying fat consumption.", 'However, overall, no associations between
    these patterns and breast cancer risk were observed.', 'Furthermore, Zhang et
    al.', used a validated FFQ to assess dietary intake in 438 cases with histologically
    confirmed primary breast cancer and 438 controls., "After using principal component
    analysis, two dietary patterns were identified: vegetable\u2013fruit\u2013soy\u2013milk\u2013poultry\u2013fish
    and refined grain\u2013meat\u2013pickle pattern.", "When the analysis was adjusted
    for confounders, a 74 % decreased risk was observed among women in the highest
    quartile of the vegetable\u2013fruit\u2013soy\u2013milk\u2013poultry\u2013fish
    dietary pattern relative to the lowest quartile.", 'Moreover, when Hirose et al.',
  "conducted a case\u2013control study using data from the hospital-based epidemiological
    research program at Aichi Cancer Center, principal component analysis was used
    to derive food patterns based on 31 food variables.", "From the four major dietary
    patterns that were extracted, the first one was labeled as \u201Cprudent\u201D
    and was characterized by the consumption of vegetables, fruit, soybean curd, fish,
    and milk and lower consumption of fatty and salty foods.", 'After adjusting for
    potential confounders, an inverse association was evident for the above pattern.',
  'More recently, in the California Teachers Study Cohort, data from 91,779 women
    were analyzed and five predominant dietary patterns were identified using principal
    component analysis.', "The first one that was labeled as the \u201Cplant-based\u201D
    and was characterized by high consumption of fruits and vegetables was associated
    with a reduction in breast cancer risk .", 'Similarly, Baglietto et al.', 'after
    using data from the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study which included 20,967
    women applied principal component analysis to 124 foods and identified four dietary
    factors.', 'Between them, only that characterized by high consumption of fruit
    and salads was associated with a reduced risk, with stronger associations observed
    for tumors not expressing estrogen and progesterone receptors.', 'Regarding the
    derived food patterns that were extracted, it was observed that the patterns that
    were mainly characterized by the consumption of fruits and vegetables as well
    as olive oil were associated with lower likelihood of breast cancer.', 'Fruits
    and vegetables contain a wide range of constituents which may have cancer-preventing
    effects including antioxidant vitamins such as vitamin C and vitamin E, folate,
    dietary fiber, dithiolthiones, glucosinolates, indoles, isothiocyanates, protease
    inhibitors, and phytochemicals .', 'Moreover, they contain a large amount of dietary
    fiber, for which mechanistic data support the plausibility of a protective effect
    on breast carcinogenesis, especially for vegetable fiber, due to their combination
    of soluble and insoluble fibers in equal proportions .', 'Concerning olive oil,
    animal and human studies have associated its consumption with lower incidence
    and mortality rates from some cancers including that of the breast.', 'According
    to the studies, it can influence the stages of the carcinogenesis process as well
    as the immune system, the oxidative stress, alter the hormonal status, modify
    the structure and function of cell membranes, and modulate cell signaling transduction
    pathways and regulation of gene expression.', 'Its probable chemoprotective effect
    can be attributed to its particular fatty acid composition: It contains a high
    amount of oleic acid, a suitable amount of polyunsaturated fatty acids, a relatively
    low n-6 PUFA/n-3 PUFA ratio, as well as minor bioactive compounds such as squalene
    and phenolic antioxidants .', "The major limitation of this study was, as in all
    case\u2013control studies, the recall bias.", 'However, an effort was given to
    minimize this limitation by choosing newly diagnosed consecutive patients and
    collecting all subjects in a small period of time.', "Regarding the selection
    of the controls, the \u201Chealthy\u201D volunteer effect may exist.", "Moreover,
    selection bias may also exists, but as mentioned in the Methods section, an effort
    was given to reduce it by performing, when possible, random selection of the controls,
    enrolling controls based on their willingness to participate and not on any of
    the exposure factors\u2019 distribution that would substantially alter the results,
    using the same catchment area as the patients, and avoiding any \u201Cspecific\u201D
    sampling rule in the allocation of the participants.", All these procedures were
    applied to ensure that the control group reflected the distribution of the exposure
    characteristics of the referent population of the cases., 'Moreover, people who
    collected the data were commonly well trained before the beginning of the study,
    limiting the intra-investigators bias.', "The effect size measures used in case\u2013control
    studies tend to overestimate the actual effect of the cause on effect usually
    observed in prospective studies; thus, the findings should be interpreted with
    caution.", "Dietary pattern analysis revealed behaviors in participants\u2019
    consumption that could not be assessed with any other method.", "It was found
    that a dietary behavior that was mainly characterized by the consumption of whole
    grains, fruits, and vegetables, as well as a dietary behavior characterized by
    the consumption of olive oil and fish, favorably \u201Caffected\u201D the odds
    of having breast cancer.", "Beyond the important nutritional message these findings
    carry on, they deserve further attention from a methodological point-of-view because
    the a posteriori dietary pattern assessment approach that was followed here reflects
    the \u201Ctrue\u201D habits of the participants and not the level of adherence
    to an a priori defined dietary model.", 'The authors would like to thank all the
