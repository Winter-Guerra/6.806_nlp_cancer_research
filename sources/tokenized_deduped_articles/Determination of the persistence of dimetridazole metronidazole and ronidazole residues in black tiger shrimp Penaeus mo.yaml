["The depletion of three banned nitroimidazole drugs \u2013 dimetridazole, metronidazole
    and ronidazole \u2013 was investigated in black tiger shrimp following in-water
    medication.", The highest concentrations of residues were measured immediately
    after the 24-h immersion., "At this time, MNZ and MNZ-OH residues were measured
    in shrimp tissue samples at concentrations ranging from 361 to 4189 and from 0.28
    to 6.6 \u03BCg kg\u22121, respectively.", "DMZ and its metabolites HMMNI ranged
    in concentration between 31 509 and 37 780 and between 15.0 and 31.9 \u03BCg kg\u22121,
    respectively.", "RNZ and HMMNI concentrations ranged from 14 530 to 24 206 and
    from 25.0 to 55 \u03BCg kg\u22121, respectively.", 'MNZ, DMZ and RNZ were the
    more persistent marker residues and can be detected for at least 8 days post-treatment.',
  MNZ-OH was only detectable on d0 following treatment with MNZ., 'HMMNI residues
    were only detectable up to d1 or d2 following DMZ and RNZ treatment, respectively.',
  "The parent drugs MNZ, DMZ and RNZ were still measureable on d8 at 0.12\u20131.0,
    40.5\u201355 and 8.8\u201318.7 \u03BCg kg\u22121, respectively.", The study also
    investigated the stability of nitroimidazole residues under various cooking procedures.,
  The experiments were carried out in shrimp muscle tissue containing both high and
    low concentrations of these residues., Different cooking procedures showed the
    impact on nitroimidazole residue concentration in shrimp tissue., 'Residue concentration
    depleted significantly, but partially, by boiling and/or microwaving, but the
    compounds were largely resistant to conventional grilling or frying.', Cooking
    cannot therefore be considered as a safeguard against harmful nitroimidazole residues
    in shrimp.]
