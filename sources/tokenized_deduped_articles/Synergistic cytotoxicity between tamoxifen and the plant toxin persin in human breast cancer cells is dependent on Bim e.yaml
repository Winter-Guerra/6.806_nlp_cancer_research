[Phytochemicals have provided an abundant source of novel therapeutics for the treatment
    of human cancers., 'We have previously described a novel plant toxin, persin,
    derived from avocado leaves, which has unique in vivo actions in the mammary epithelium
    and Bim-dependent, cytotoxic effects in human breast cancer cells in vitro.',
  'Compounds structurally similar to persin, such as the polyunsaturated fatty acid,
    conjugated linoleic acid, can attenuate steroid hormone receptor signaling and
    modulate the response of breast cancer cells to antiestrogens.', 'Here, we provide
    evidence that persin may have similar effects by showing its potent proapoptotic
    synergy with the antiestrogen 4-hydroxytamoxifen.', 'However, although persin
    transcriptionally down-regulates estrogen receptor expression, unlike conjugated
    linoleic acid, it also shows efficacy in ER-negative breast cancer cells, both
    alone and in combination with 4-hydroxytamoxifen, whereas normal breast epithelial
    cells are unaffected, suggesting it may act via a distinct, ER-independent mechanism.',
  These proapoptotic synergistic interactions are associated with increased de novo
    ceramide synthesis and are dependent on expression of the proapoptotic protein
    Bim., 'These data show that persin should be further investigated as a potential
    novel cancer therapeutic agent because it significantly enhances the sensitivity
    of breast cancer cells to the cytotoxic effects of tamoxifen, regardless of their
    ER status, while displaying apparent specificity for the malignant phenotype.']
