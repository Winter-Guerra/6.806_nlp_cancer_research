[Xenobiotics are usually detoxified by drug-metabolizing enzymes and excreted from
    the body., The expression of many of drug-metabolizing enzymes is regulated by
    the aryl hydrocarbon receptor., Some substances in vegetables have the potential
    to be AHR ligands., 'To search for vegetable components that exhibit AHR-mediated
    transcriptional activity, we assessed the activity of vegetable extracts and identified
    the active compounds using the previously established stable AHR-responsive HepG2
    cell line.', 'Among the hot water extracts of vegetables, the highest activity
    was found in ginger.', 'The ethyl acetate fraction of the ginger hot water extract
    remarkably induced AHR-mediated transcriptional activity, and the major active
    compound was found to be 6-shogaol.', 'Subsequently, the mRNA levels of AHR-targeting
    drug-metabolizing enzymes and the protein level of CYP1A1 in HepG2 cells were
    shown to be increased by 6-shogaol.', This is the first report that 6-shogaol
    can regulate the expression of detoxification enzymes by AHR activation., "The
    human body is exposed to a wide variety of xenobiotics in one\u2019s lifetime,
    from food components to environmental toxins to pharmaceuticals; it has developed
    complex enzymatic mechanisms to detoxify these substances.", 'Lipophilic xenobiotics
    are usually metabolized into more hydrophilic forms by drug-metabolizing enzymes,
    mainly in the liver, and excreted from the body.', 'The metabolism of xenobiotics
    is commonly broken down into three systems: phase I, II, and III systems.', '(1,
    2) The phase I system is an oxidative process and is mainly mediated by the cytochrome
    P450 supergene family.', 'As a consequence of this step in the detoxification,
    reactive molecules, which may be more toxic than the parent molecule, are produced.',
  'In the phase II system, activated hydrophobic xenobiotics are converted into hydrophilic
    forms via conjugation reactions with glucuronide, sulfate, or glutathione.', 'The
    phase II system is composed of conjugation enzymes such as glutathione-S-transferases,
    sulfotransferases, and uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferases.', The phase
    III system is composed of more than 40 different human ATP-binding cassette transporter
    families and is involved in the exclusion of xenobiotics and their metabolites.,
  'It has been shown that the gene expression of many of these drug-metabolizing enzymes
    and transporters is regulated by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, which is a ligand-dependent
    transcription factor present in most cell and tissue types in the body.', (3)
    AHR translocates into the nucleus and heterodimerizes with a protein known as
    the aryl hydrocarbon nuclear translocator., '(4) This AHR/ARNT complex binds to
    specific enhancer sequences adjacent to target promoters termed the xenobiotic-responsive
    element, which enhances the transcription of target genes encoding phase I metabolic
    enzymes such as CYP1A1 and CYP1A2, phase II metabolic enzymes such as UGT1A1 and
    UGT1A6, and phase III metabolic enzymes such as the ABC transporter subfamily
    G, member 2.', '(2, 5-9) Therefore, AHR is regarded as a key regulator of xenobiotic
    metabolism.', 'The regulation of AHR by dietary factors is of considerable importance
    and interest because AHR regulates drug-metabolizing enzymes as described above,
    and so it is likely that metabolism of xenobiotics could be modulated by dietary
    factors via AHR.', 'In previous studies, some substances contained in vegetables,
    such as flavonoids,(10-12) indole compounds,(13, 14) and curcumin,(15) were shown
    to act as natural AHR ligands.', 'However, it is possible that vegetables contain
    other AHR-activating compounds because there are so many plant-derived compounds
    in vegetables.', The aim of this study was to search for vegetable components
    that exhibited AHR-mediated transcriptional activity and modulation of xenobiotic
    metabolism., 'Previously, we established the stable AHR-responsive HepG2 cell
    line by cotransfection of an AHR expression vector and an AHR-responsive vector
    containing a luciferase gene and three tandemly arranged XRE elements into the
    human hepatoma cell line, HepG2.', '(16) Using this cell line, we assessed the
    AHR-mediated transcriptional activity of vegetable extracts and identified new
    active compounds in vegetables.', We also examined the regulation of mRNA and
    protein expressions of AHR-target xenobiotic-metabolizing genes by these active
    compounds., "The stable AHR-responsive HepG2 cells and HepG2/mock cells were grown

    black tea, and propolis functioned as natural antagonists toward AHR.', '(18-20)
    Moreover, it was reported that extracts of vegetables, such as molokhia, suppressed
    AHR transformation in cell-free systems.', '(21) However, these reports focused
    on the suppressive effect of food extracts on AHR activation.', De Waard et al.,
  'suggested that extracts of citrus pulp and grapefruit juice contained natural AHR
    agonists,(22) but detailed studies on AHR activation by vegetable extracts have
    not yet been reported.', We examined the effect of HWEs from various vegetables
    on AHR-mediated transcriptional activity by the luciferase assay using the stable
    AHR-responsive HepG2 and HepG2/mock cell lines., 'The results showed that the
    HWEs from ginger, molokhia, parsley, spinach, and ashitaba increased AHR-mediated
    transcriptional activity.', 'These five HWEs increased the luciferase activity
    in a dose-dependent manner at concentrations of 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mg/mL.', 'In
    this study, the HWE from molokhia induced AHR-mediated transcriptional activity,
    even though the molokhia extract has previously been suggested to be an AHR antagonist.',
  '(21) Molokhia contains quercetin in abundance,(23) which could function as an AHR
    antagonist(11) or an AHR agonist.', '(12, 24) Therefore, compounds in molokhia
    such as quercetin could cause contradictory results.', The results presented in
    this study are the first to indicate that some vegetable extracts can increase
    AHR-mediated transcriptional activity., Our data indicated that the HWEs from
    five vegetables contained compounds that may activate AHR., We evaluated the AHR-mediated
    transcriptional activity of the WFs and EAFs of each vegetable to delineate the
    active compound in each HWE., 'Because HWEs were crude extracts, we used the HepG2/MOCK
    cell line to exclude nonspecific luciferase activity.', 'Since nonspecific luciferase
    activity was not observed, we did not use the HepG2/MOCK cell line in subsequent
    experiments.', The luciferase assay using ethyl acetate and water fraction from
    all five vegetables showed that parsley and spinach had no activity in both fractions.,
  'In addition, the ethyl acetate fractions from molokhia and ashitaba had much less
    activity than that from ginger, so we focused on the identification of active
    compounds in ginger.', 'Therefore, to further identify the AHR-activating compounds,
    we analyzed this fraction by HPLC.', 'Shogaols and gingerols are the main compounds
    in ginger and ginger products, and 6-shogaol and 6-gingerol are the main components,(25-28)
    so we analyzed the EAF from ginger, 6-shogaol, and 6-gingerol.', 'We showed that
    two major peaks appeared at retention times of 38 and 46 min, and these peaks
    corresponded to the peaks of 6-gingerol and 6-shogaol, respectively.', This data
    suggested that 6-gingerol and 6-shogaol were the main compounds in EAF from ginger.,
  'Shogaols are compounds formed by dehydrating gingerols, and they are not thought
    to be present in fresh rhizome.', '(25, 26) Gingerols are not stable during storage
    or thermal processing, and they generate shogaols.', '(25, 26) It was suggested
    that the 6-shogaol detected in the EAF from ginger in this study resulted from
    the conversion of 6-gingerol to 6-shogaol during the extraction in hot water.',
  Treatment of the stable AHR-responsive HepG2 cells with 6-shogaol for 24 h resulted
    in significant increases in luciferase activity in a dose-dependent manner., These
    data are the first to verify induction of AHR-mediated transcriptional activity
    by 6-shogaol., 'More interestingly, 6-gingerol had no effect on AHR-mediated transcriptional
    activity.', 6-Shogaol has been reported to have a much stronger inhibitory effect
    on the growth of various cancer cell lines than 6-gingerol., (29-31) Koliopanos
    et al., and Peng et al., reported that AHR agonists inhibited the growth of cancer
    cells., '(32, 33) Our finding that 6-shogaol, but not 6-gingerol, is a strong
    AHR activator may explain why 6-shogaol has a stronger inhibitory effect on the
    growth of cancer cells.', We think that only evaluation of the activities of the
    two most abundant components in ginger was insufficient to identify the active
    compounds in ginger., 'Therefore, 8-shogaol, 10-shogaol, 8-gingerol, and 10-gingerol,
    the major compounds in ginger other than 6-shogaol and 6-gingerol, were used for
    the luciferase assay.', 'Figure 4C shows that 8-shogaol had the same activity
    as 6-shogaol, but 8-shogaol was not detected in the HPLC chromatogram of EAF from
    ginger shown in Figure 3A.', These results show that 6-shogaol is the most major
    activator of AHR among shogaols and gingerols., "Moreover, the concentration of
    6-shogaol in the solution of EAF from ginger was calculated to be about 27 \u03BCM
    by HPLC analysis.", "In this study, the AHR-mediated transcriptional activity
    was 4\u20135 fold induction when 100 \u03BCg/mL of the EAF from ginger was used,
    whereas the transcriptional activity was about 2-fold induction when 25 \u03BCM
    of 6-shogaol was used.", 'Based on these data, the activity of 6-shogaol accounted
    for about 50% of activity, so 6-shogaol is thought to be the most major activator
    of AHR in ginger.', '6-Shogaol induced mRNA expression of the following AHR-target
    genes: phase I metabolic enzyme CYP1A1, phase II metabolic enzyme UGT1A1, and
    phase III metabolic enzyme ABCG 2 and protein expression of CYP1A1.', These are
    the first data indicating that 6-shogaol induced expression of detoxification
    enzymes., Liska reported that a multifunctional inducer in detoxification systems
    was important., '(1) Indeed, we have demonstrated the usefulness of 6-shogaol
    as a multifunctional inducer in this report.', "The AHR has been found to favor
    hydrophobic molecular with a quasi-planar structure and to accommodate a ligand-binding
    pocket of approximately 14 \xD7 12 \xD7 5 \xC5.", '(34, 35) Some flavonoids that
    induce AHR activity have molecular sizes and planar structures that could bind
    to a ligand-binding pocket of AHR.', '(10) Although there is no report about the
    detailed structure analysis of 6-shogaol, based on its structure, we guess that
    the molecular size of 6-shogaol is smaller than that of flavonoids and that 6-shogaol
    may bind to a ligand-binding pocket of AHR.', 'Moreover, shogaols, but not gingerols,
    induced AHR activity in this study.', "Unlike gingerols, shogaols have the \u03B1,\u03B2-unsaturated
    ketone group.", Compounds having this structure are good substrates for Michael
    addition reactions and are rendered electrophilic by conjugation with electron-withdrawing
    groups., (36) This difference of electrophilic nature based on the structures
    of shogaols and gingerols may cause the difference of AHR activities., Another
    possible mechanism of AHR activation by 6-shogaol is the effect of its metabolites.,
  'We evaluated the AHR-mediated transcriptional activity and mRNA expression of AHR-target
    genes by treatment of cells with 6-shogaol for 24 h. Most 6-shogaol has been shown
    to be metabolized to other reduced forms within 24 h in various cancer cell lines,
    and these metabolites retain their bioactivity.', '(37-39) Recently, the cysteine-conjugated
    metabolite of 6-shogaol, 5-cysteinyl-6-shogaol, exerts its bioactivity by acting
    as a carrier of 6-shogaol in cancer cells and showed strong growth inhibitory
    effects toward cancer cells.', (39) These bioactive metabolites of 6-shogaol may
    contribute to induction of AHR activity., Further experiments are necessary to
    reveal whether or not the bioactive metabolites of 6-shogaol also exhibit induction
    of AHR-mediated transcriptional activity and mRNA expression of AHR-target genes.,
  'We revealed for the first time that ginger more strongly induced AHR-mediated transcription
    compared to other vegetables such as molokhia, parsley, spinach, and ashitaba.',
  We also found that 6-shogaol was the major active compound in ginger., The mRNA
    expression levels of AHR-targeting drug-metabolizing enzymes and the protein level
    of CYP1A1 in HepG2 cells were induced by 6-shogaol., These results are the first
    verification of AHR-mediated regulation of detoxification systems by 6-shogaol.,
  'This study suggests that AHR-mediated modulation of detoxification systems can
    be expected in the presence of 6-shogaol, although in vivo studies are needed
    to clarify whether AHR will be activated by the intake of 6-shogaol.']
