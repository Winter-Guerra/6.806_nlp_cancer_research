['This study assesses the association between salt added atthe table, processed meat
    and the risk of various cancers.', 'Mailed questionnaires were completed by 19
    732patients with histologically confirmed incident cancer of the stomach, colon,
    rectum, pancreas, lung, breast, ovary, prostate, testis, kidney, bladder, brain,
    non-Hodgkins lymphoma or leukaemia, and 5039 population controls,between 1994
    and 1997.', 'Measurement included information on socioeconomic status, lifestyle
    habits and diet.', A 69-item food frequency questionnaire provided dataon eating
    habits 2 years before the study., Odds ratiosand 95% confidence intervals were
    derived through unconditional logistic regression., 'Compared with never adding
    salt at the table, always or often adding salt at the table was associated with
    an increased risk of stomach, lung, testicular and bladder cancer.', 'Processed
    meat was significantly related to the risk of the stomach, colon, rectum, pancreas,
    lung, prostate, testis, kidney and bladdercancer and leukaemia; the odds ratios
    for the highest quartile ranged from 1.3 to 1.7.', The findings addtothe evidence
    that high consumption of salt and processed meat may play a role in the aetiology
    of several cancers.]
