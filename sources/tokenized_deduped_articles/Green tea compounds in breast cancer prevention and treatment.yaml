[Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women., 'In recent years, many in vitro
    and in vivo studies indicate that green tea possesses anti-cancer effects.', 'The
    epidemiological studies, however, have produced inconclusive results in humans.',
  'Likewise, results from animal models about the preventive or therapeutic effects
    of green tea components are inconclusive.', The mechanisms by which green tea
    intake may influence the risk of breast cancer in humans remain elusive mechanisms
    by which green tea intake may influence., 'Here, we review recent studies of green
    tea polyphenols and their applications in the prevention and treatment of breast
    cancer.', 'Furthermore, we discuss the effect of green tea components on breast
    cancer by reviewing epidemiological studies, animal model studies and clinical
    trials.', 'At last, we discuss the mechanisms by which green tea components suppress
    the development and recurrence of breast cancer.', A better understanding of the
    mechanisms will improve the utilization of green tea in breast cancer prevention
    and therapy and pave the way to novel prevention and treatment strategies for
    breast cancer.]
