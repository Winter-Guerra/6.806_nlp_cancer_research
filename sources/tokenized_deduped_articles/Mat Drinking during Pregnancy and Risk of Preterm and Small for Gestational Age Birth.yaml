["Mat\xE9, a hot infusion of Ilex paraguayensis, is a beverage largely consumed in
    Southeast Latin America, including during pregnancy.", "To assess the effect of
    mat\xE9 drinking during pregnancy on preterm and small for gestational age birth,
    a cross-sectional study was done.", 'From January 1st to December 31st, 1993,
    in the first 24 h after delivery, all 5304 mothers giving birth at the hospitals
    in Pelotas, Southern Brazil, were interviewed and several of their characteristics
    were gathered.', Birthweight was recorded and gestational age at birth assessed
    using the Dubowitz score., All 5189 single births were analyzed., 'The prevalence
    of SGA and preterm birth was 8.0 and 9.1%, respectively.', "Mat\xE9 intake at
    least once a week during the entire pregnancy period was reported by \u223C68%
    of the mothers.", "Crude analyses showed a 30% increase in the risk of SGA among
    daily mat\xE9 drinkers compared with nonconsumers, whereas no statistical association
    was detected with preterm births.", 'After controlling for confounders, the significance
    of the association with SGA birth no longer held and the lack of association with
    prematurity remained unchanged.', "In conclusion, prevalence of daily mat\xE9
    drinking was high among pregnant women and, contrary to the hypothesis, no harmful
    effect on intrauterine growth or duration of pregnancy was detected."]
