[Maternal consumption of a diet high in omega 6 polyunsaturated fats has been shown
    to increase risk whereas a diet high in omega 3 polyunsaturated fats from fish
    oil has been shown to decrease risk for mammary gland cancer in female offspring
    of rats., The aim of this study was to determine whether increasing n-3 PUFA and
    reducing n-6 PUFA by using canola oil instead of corn oil in the maternal diet
    might reduce the risk for breast cancer in female offspring., Female SV 129 mice
    were divided into two groups and placed on diets containing either 10% w/w corn
    oil or 10% w/w canola oil., After two weeks on the diets the females were bred
    with homozygous C3(1) TAg transgenic mice., Mother mice consumed the assigned
    diet throughout gestation and nursing of the offspring., 'After weaning, all female
    offspring were maintained on the control diet.', 'Compared to offspring of mothers
    fed the corn oil diet, offspring of mothers fed the canola oil diet had significantly
    fewer mammary glands with tumors throughout the experiment.', 'At 130 days of
    age, the CA/CO group had significantly fewer tumors per mouse; the tumor incidence
    and the total tumor weight was less than one half that of the CO/CO group.', 'At
    170 days of age, the total tumor weight per mouse was significantly less in the
    CA/CO group and if a tumor developed the rate of tumor growth rate was half that
    of CO/CO group.', These results indicate that maternal consumption of canola oil
    was associated with delayed appearance of mammary gland tumors and slowed growth
    of the tumors that developed., Substituting canola oil for corn oil is an easy
    dietary change for people to make; such a change to the maternal diet may decrease
    risk for breast cancer in the daughter., It has been shown that diets that contain
    high amounts of omega 6 polyunsaturated fatty acids increase the growth rates
    of cancers  whereas omega 3 PUFA have been shown to reduce cancer growth rates  and
    have been suggested as cancer preventive agents ., The type of fat consumed by
    the mother during pregnancy and nursing of the offspring has also been shown to
    influence mammary gland cancer risk in the offspring., A maternal diet that contained
    a high amount of omega 6 fatty acids increased the risk for mammary gland cancer
    in the carcinogen treated offspring ., 'Compared to a corn oil diet, maternal
    consumption of either an olive oil containing diet  or of a diet containing long
    chain omega 3 PUFA from fish oil  has been shown to decrease carcinogen induced
    mammary gland cancer in rat offspring.', We have reported that the 18 carbon omega
    3 PUFA found in canola oil also effectively slowed the growth of implanted mammary
    gland cancers ., We hypothesized that a maternal diet that contained canola oil
    instead of corn oil would increase maternal dietary omega 3 PUFA and thus reduce
    the risk for mammary gland cancer in the offspring., The C3(1) SV40 T-antigen
    transgenic mouse was selected as the model for this study., This mouse is a well
    characterized model developed in the laboratory of Dr. Jeffrey E. Green jeffrey.green1@nih.gov.,
  The transgene uses the 5 flanking region of the rat C3(1) prostate steroid binding
    protein to target expression of the SV 40 large T-antigen in the mammary gland
    and prostate ., The female mice develop invasive mammary gland tumors by 16 weeks
    of age ., 'The tumors are similar to human infiltrating ductal carcinomas, are
    hormone responsive at early stages but become hormone independent in later stages  similar
    to advanced human breast cancers.', 'The lesions develop in a predictable time,
    thus, this mouse is a good model to study alterations in tumorigenesis and progression
    .', 'The T-antigen is thought to induce cancer by inactivation of p53  and Rb
    , two proteins that are involved in cell cycle regulation.', Both p53 and Rb are
    tumor suppressors and are frequently mutated in human breast cancer., 'Since the
    mouse has a strong transgenic tumor promoter, complete prevention of tumors would
    not be expected but a delay in tumor development or slower tumor growth compared
    to a control group would indicate cancer preventive benefit.', 'Most studies that
    have tested effects of omega 3 fatty acids on cancer have used the long chain
    omega 3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic or docosahexaenoic as the test fatty acids
    .', 'These fatty acids are most commonly found in fish, thus fish oil or fish
    oil concentrates are frequently incorporated into diets.', "However, the double
    bond in the omega 3 position is produced by plants not by animals, and can be
    found in plant products as the 18 carbon fat, \u03B1-linolenic acid.", 'Good dietary
    sources of ALA include canola oil, walnuts and omega 3 eggs .', Flaxseed or flaxseed
    oil is also a good source of ALA  but is often consumed as a dietary supplement
    rather than a part of the regular diet., 'Canola oil contains about 10% ALA and
    about 20% linoleic acid, an 18 carbon omega 6 fatty acid , whereas corn oil contains
    about 50% LA and about 1% ALA .', 'A ratio of omega 3 to omega 6 fatty acids of
    somewhere between 1:1 and 1:4 has been suggested to be much healthier than the
    1:10 to 1:25 ratio of omega 3 to omega 6 fatty acids contained in the usual Western
    diet .', The ALA that is consumed by animals may be metabolized without change
    or it may be elongated and desaturated to longer chain lipids of the omega 3 series
    ., 'Humans elongate and desaturate ALA, however there is controversy about the
    efficiency of this conversion .', 'Recent reports indicate that humans do convert
    ALA to measurable amounts of EPA and docosapentaenoic acid and that the conversion
    is adequate to reduce measures of inflammation, indicating biologic activity of
    the omega 3 fatty acids in humans .', 'Long chain omega 3 PUFA incorporated in
    tissues have been shown to slow cancer growth in animal models by multiple mechanisms
    including: slowing proliferation, increasing apoptosis , increasing lipid peroxidation  and
    increasing oxidative damage in cancer cells but not normal cells .', Induction
    of these mechanisms is correlated with an increased amount of the n-3 PUFA in
    the tissues., 'Johnson, et.', al., 'used data from the National Health and Nutrition
    Survey, 1999-2002, to estimate the actual consumption of ALA and LA in the average
    American diet .', 'They report that the usual diet of adult Americans contains
    about 14.7 g of LA and about 1.5 g of ALA per day , almost 10 times as much LA
    as ALA.', 'They estimated that if Americans replaced vegetable oils, butter, and
    margarine with canola oil or canola oil based margarine the intakes of ALA would
    increase to 2.6 g per day and of LA would decrease to 8.1 g per day .', 'This
    would change the ratio of these omega 3 and omega 6 fatty acids in the diet to
    about 1:3, a much healthier ratio that would better meet current dietary fat recommendations
    .', We have shown that the use of canola oil as a source of omega 3 PUFA significantly
    slowed the growth rate of MDA-MB 231 human breast cancers implanted in nude mice
    and that the decreased tumor growth rate was associated with increased long chain
    omega 3 PUFA in mouse tissues ., There is a suggestion that canola oil use may
    be beneficial against cancer in humans in that women who used canola oil for cooking
    had a lower risk for breast cancer than those who used hydrogenated fats or corn
    oil ., 'The use of canola oil instead of corn oil is a diet change that would
    be easy to make since canola oil could be substituted for corn oil in baking,
    frying and salad dressings.', 'Our results indicate that such a dietary change
    could result in important health benefits, perhaps decreasing risk for cancer
    in the next generation.', 'Twenty, female SV129 mice, 6 weeks old were obtained
    from Charles River Laboratories.', Breeding pairs of mice bearing a transgene
    for the SV40 large T antigen with a C3(1) rat prostate steroid binding protein
    promoter were obtained from the Dr. Jeffrey Green., The female transgenic mice
    are expected to develop mammary gland cancer due to expression of the large T
    antigen in the mammary gland ., The transgenic line is maintained in the laboratory
    and all mice are genotyped to ensure presence of the transgene., All animal work
    was approved by the Marshall University School of Medicine Institutional Animal
    Care and Use Committee., 'Mice were quarantined for 2 weeks, and then moved to
    a study room.', SV129 females were split into 2 groups and numbered for identification.,
  Ten female mice were placed on a diet containing 10% w/w corn oil and ten female
    mice were placed on a diet containing 10% w/w canola oil., After 2 weeks these
    females were bred with homozygous C3(1)/TAg male mice., The hemizygous female
    pups from these breedings were the experimental mice NOT the wild type mother
    mice., 'Pups were weaned at 21 days old and placed on the corn oil containing
    diet, generating two experimental groups: corn/corn and canola/corn.', Only the
    maternal diet of the CA/CO group contained canola oil not the diet of the experimental
    pups., 'The offspring were housed 3 to 4 in a cage, individually numbered for
    identification, and weighed weekly.', Diets were prepared in the Marshall University
    School of Medicine animal diet prep room., 'Diet composition is shown in Table
    1 and was formulated to be isocaloric, isonutrient and more relevant to human
    consumption than the high fat diets used in many studies.', The AIN-76A diet is
    adequate for the nutritional support of the mice ., 'The dry ingredients of the
    diet, except sugar, were obtained in bulk from MP Biomedicals, sugar and oil were
    purchased locally.', 'Batches of diet were prepared as needed, about each two
    weeks.', The diet mixture was pressed into trays and cut into small squares.,
  "Individual cage sized portions were stored in sealed containers at -20\xB0C to
    prevent oxidation of the fat and bacterial growth in the food.", Mice had free
    access to food and water and were fed fresh food 5 days per week., Food removed
    from cages was discarded., Real time PCR was used to verify the presence of the
    transgene in all experimental pups., 'Ear punches were digested in digestion buffer
    , followed by dilution of the samples 1:40 in milliQ water.', Primers for the
    transgene and the VIC labeled SV40PROBE were purchased from Applied Biosystems.,
  Beta-actin primers and FAM labeled probe and PCR Master Mix were also purchased
    from Applied Biosystems., The rtPCR assay was performed according to the Applied
    Biosystems instructions on an ABI Prism 7000 instrument., Mice were palpated for
    tumors 3 times weekly from 90 days of age., Lengths and widths of palpable tumors
    were measured from the time of detection until euthanasia to estimate tumor volumes.,
  'Tumor volume was estimated using the formula:/2.', "Prism\xA9 software was used
    to plot tumor growth curves and for regression analyses to determine the growth
    rate of each palpable tumor.", A T-test was then used to compare the mean tumor
    growth rates between groups of mice., 'Total tumor incidence, multiplicity and
    weights were determined at necropsy.', "The differences between groups and across
    time were statistically analyzed by two way analyses of variance, T-test, Fisher
    exact test or Mann-Whitney test as appropriate using Prism\xA9 software.", 'Mice
    were euthanized at 21, 110, 130, 150 and 170 days of age.', Twenty one days of
    age was the time of weaning., 'The earliest time for tumors was expected to be
    110 days of age, mice were euthanized each 20 days thereafter to follow the increase
    in tumor incidence and multiplicity.', The left 4th mammary gland was quickly
    removed and frozen in liquid nitrogen., All ten mammary glands were examined for
    the presence of a tumor 1 mm or larger., 'All tumors detected were measured, removed
    and weighed, thus total tumor weight and numbers includes many tumors that were
    too small to be detected by palpation.', 'If tumor was large enough for further
    assay, it was flash frozen in liquid nitrogen.', The number of tumors in each
    gland and the number of glands with tumor were recorded for every mouse., Samples
    of inguinal fat and liver were removed and frozen in liquid nitrogen until further
    analyses., Body weights were measured each week and terminally., "Statistical
    differences in mean body weight change between groups were determined using a
    T-test and Prism\xA9 software.", The fatty acid compositions of mammary glands
    and liver at 3 weeks of age and 130 days of age were analyzed by gas chromatography.,
  Frozen tissues were thawed and homogenized in distilled water containing 0.1% BHT
    to prevent oxidation of the fatty acids., 'Lipids were extracted with chloroform/methanol,
    the fatty acids were methylated followed by separation and identification using
    gas chromatography, as previously described .', "Gas chromatography was done using
    a PerkinElmer Clarus 500 Gas Chromatograph with a Elite-5 Dimethyl-polisiloxane
    Series Capillary Column, under the following conditions: initial temperature 150\xB0C,
    ramp 1 at 175\xB0C for 15 min, ramp 2 at 225\xB0C for 50 min, ramp 3 at 250\xB0C
    for 10 min, helium carrier gas flow rate of 1.60 ml/min.", Fatty acid methyl ester
    standards were used for peak identification., 'For a better identification of
    the peaks two standards were used: GLC #464 which contains 52 fatty acids and
    a custom preparation, GLC #704, which contains 10 fatty acids, methyl esters of
    stearate, oleate, linoleate, alpha linolenate, gamma linolenate, homogamma linolenate,
    arachidonate, eicosapentaenoate, docosapentaenoate, and docosahexaenoate.', The
    fatty acid methyl esters were reported as the percent of the total methylated
    fatty acids., 'Using this protocol and column, we could not clearly separate the
    oleic acid and alpha linolenic acid peaks thus we report these results as 18:1
    + 18:3 ALA.', 'However, the differences in the peaks due to diet should be mostly
    ALA since it is the dietary ALA that was altered.', A T-test was used to determine
    statistical differences of individual fatty acids between dietary groups., "The
    Mouse Signal Transduction Pathway Finder\u2122 RT2 Profiler\u2122 PCR Array, PAMM-014
    was used to analyze the expression of genes in 3-4 mammary glands per group at

    the protocol of the manufacturer to isolate the RNA., RNA quality control was
    performed for all samples to insure the purity and integrity of the RNA on an
    Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer., The RT2 First Strand Kit was used to make cDNA; the
    cDNA was then quantitatively amplified by real time PCR using an ABI Prism 7000
    and RT2 qPCR Master Mix according to the manufacturers protocol., "The protocol
    and software provided by SuperArray were followed to determine relative fold difference
    in gene expression using the \u0394\u0394ct method and for statistical analyses
    of the data by T-test.", "Frozen mammary gland tissues were homogenized in tissue
    extraction buffer from BioSource International, Inc. at 4\xB0C to prepare cell

    the manufacturers protocol., 'Ten micrograms of protein were applied to each lane
    of a 4-15% Tris-HCl polyacrylamide gradient gel, separated by electrophoresis
    and then transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane.', "The blots were blocked
    with 5% BSA in TBST overnight at 4\xB0C and probed with primary antibodies against
    \ in blocking buffer for 1 hour at room temperature.", The membrane was thereafter
    incubated with antimouse secondary antibody horseradish peroxidase conjugate followed
    by signal detection with chemiluminescence., Densitometry was used to quantify
    bands., 'A ChemDoc XRS system was used to acquire the image then image analysis
    was done using Quantity One software, V. 4.5.2.', Data was normalized by cytokeratin
    and by GAPDH., 'Groups will be referred to as: 1) CO/CO - mothers fed the 10%
    corn oil diet, pup weaned to the 10% corn oil diet or 2) CA/CO - mothers fed the
    10% canola oil diet, pups weaned to the 10% corn oil diet.', Pups were NOT exposed
    to the 10% canola oil diet after weaning., Mice were allowed free access to food.,
  There was no difference due to maternal diet in the amount of weight gained between
    weaning and 170 days of age by the groups of experimental mice., Figure 1 shows
    the mean amount of weight gained per mouse per day from weaning until 170 days.,
  Figure 1., Mean body weight gain between 21 and 130 days of age., Body weight gain
    between 21 and 130 days of age was determined for each mouse., There was no significant
    difference between the two groups in body weight gain between weaning and 130
    days of age., 'CO/CO n = 14; CA/CO n = 17 mice, p = 0.95 by T-test.', The lipid
    compositions of the livers and mammary glands at 21 and 130 days of age are shown
    in Table 2., 'At 21 days of age, both the livers and the mammary glands of pups
    from the CA mothers contained significantly less of the n-6 PUFA than the livers
    and mammary glands of pups from the CO mothers.', 'At 21 days of age, the livers
    of pups from the CA mothers contained significantly more of the n-3 PUFA, ALA,
    and significantly more of the products of ALA metabolism, EPA and DHA than the
    livers of pups from the CO mothers.', The only source of the omega 3 bond was
    the ALA in the canola oil., 'Thus, the ALA in the canola oil was effectively elongated
    and desaturated to the longer chain omega 3 PUFAs, EPA and DHA, for incorporation
    into lipids in the liver.', 'At 21 days of age, the mammary glands of pups from
    the CA mothers contained significantly more ALA and DPA than the pups from the
    CO mothers.', 'The content of the longer chain fatty acids: AA, EPA, DHA and DPA
    in the mammary glands of both groups was less that 1% each indicating less incorporation
    of long chain fatty acids or less activity of elongation and desaturation enzymes
    in the mammary glands than in the liver.', All mice were fed the corn oil diet
    from 21 to 130 days of age., At 130 days of age the livers of the CA/CO group
    still contained significantly more ALA and significantly less AA than the CO/CO
    group., 'The LA, ALA, and AA in the mammary glands of the two groups were not
    different.', 'EPA, DHA and DPA were almost undetectable in the mammary glands
    at 130 days of age, though the small differences between groups for EPA and DPA
    were statistically significant.', Both EPA and DHA were significantly less in
    the mammary glands of the CA/CO than in the CO/CO group., 'The total number of
    tumors and the tumor weight per mouse were assessed in C3(1)TAG/129 female offspring
    at 110, 130, 150, 170 days of age.', The presence of the transgene was confirmed
    in all pups used in the experiment., 'At 110 days of age, no mice had tumors.',
  The tumor incidence at 130 days of age is shown in Figure 2A., 'The tumor incidence
    of the CA/CO group, was not quite significantly less by Fishers exact test than
    the tumor incidence of the CO/CO group,.', 'At 150 and 170 days of age, all mice
    had at least one tumor, thus the tumor incidence was 100%.', Figure 2., Tumor
    incidence and multiplicity at 130 days of age., A. Tumor incidence at 130 days
    of age was not quite significantly different due to the diet of the mother., 'CO/CO

  'Since these mice all bear a tumor promoting transgene, all mice are expected to
    develop tumors at some point.', 'As shown in Figure 2B, the tumor multiplicity
    at 130 days of age was significantly less in the CA/CO group than in the CO/CO
    group.', 'Even at 170 days of age, Figure 3A, the multiplicity of tumors in the

    The mean tumor growth rate in the CA/CO group from detection until 170 days of
    age was 1/2 the growth rate of the CO/CO group., 'The total tumor weight per mouse,
    calculated from autopsy data, indicates a difference in tumor burden due to the
    diet of the mother during gestation and lactation of the offspring.', 'At 130
    days of age, Figure 2-C, the tumor weight in the CA/CO group was not quite significantly
    less than that of the CO/CO group.', 'By 170 days of age, Figure 3-B, the tumor
    weight per mouse in the CA/CO group was significantly less than that of the CO/CO
    group.', 'The mean tumor growth rates, calculated from measured tumor growth of
    11 tumors for the CO/CO group and 8 tumors for the CA/CO group, are shown in Figure
    3C.', Linear regression analyses were used to determine the growth rate of each
    tumor., 'A T-test of the tumor growth rates showed that the mean tumor growth
    rates were slower in the CA/CO group but not quite significantly different, p
    = 0.11.', The number of glands with tumor at each time point is illustrated in
    Figure 4., Two way analysis of variance revealed that there were significant effects
    due to both diet and time., 'The number of glands with tumor was significantly
    less in the CA/CO group than in the CO/CO group, p = 0.02, and as expected, the
    number of glands with tumor was significantly increased with time, p &lt; 0.0001.',
  Figure 4., Glands with tumor per mouse with time., Two way analyses of variance
    showed that the number of glands with tumor per mouse with time was significantly
    different due to treatment and to time., Consumption of the canola oil containing
    diet by the mothers of these mice significantly decreased the number of glands
    with tumor., 'As expected, with time the number of glands with tumor increased
    in both groups.', 'Number of mice per group at 110, 130, 150 and 170 days of age
    are: CO/CO - 14, 14, 5, 9, and CA/CO -- 6, 17, 7, 11 respectively.', 'Taken together,
    these data indicate that maternal consumption of canola oil delayed appearance
    of tumors in these transgenic mice and slowed the growth rate of the tumors that
    arose, resulting in significantly reduced tumor burden at 170 days of age.', Analysis
    of expression of genes involved in multiple cell signaling pathways in mammary
    glands of mice at 130 days of age was used to identify potential mechanisms for
    how maternal consumption of canola oil might slow mammary gland tumorigenesis
    in C3(1)TAG/129 mice offspring., We chose this time point since at 130 days of
    age there were mammary glands without tumor in each group so that changes in gene
    expression due to the maternal diet but not those due to the presence of a tumor
    could be assessed., 'A priori, we did not know which signal transduction pathway(s)
    might be important for any alterations in tumor development.', "The Mouse Signal
    Transduction Pathway Finder\u2122 reverse transcriptase, real time PCR panel profiles
    the expression of 84 key genes representative of 18 different signal transduction
    pathways.", 'The CO/CO group was the control group, the CA/CO group was the experimental
    group for analysis.', The presence of the large T antigen protein in each mammary
    gland was confirmed by Western Blot., Table 3 presents genes that were analyzed
    and found to be at least 2 fold different between the two groups at 130 days of
    age., 'Differences in gene expression between groups at 130 days of age must be
    due to sustained gene expression changes induced by the maternal diet since: 1)
    both groups were weaned to the same diet 109 days previously and 2) there are
    only very small differences in fat composition in the mammary gland at 130 days
    of age and these differences do not support the notion that increased n-3 PUFA
    in the CA/CO group is influencing gene expression.', The possible significances
    of some of the changes in gene expression are presented in the discussion., The
    differences in mRNA should be reflected in changes in protein abundance., "Figure
    5 illustrates the results of Western blot for two genes of interest, fatty acid
    synthase and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein \u03B2.", 'The mouse mammary gland
    contains a high percentage of adipocyte as well as the epithelial cells that form
    cancer, thus, the protein change was normalized by the size of the epithelial
    cell compartment in the specimen, using cytokeratin, and for protein loading using
    GAPDH.', "Compared to the CO/CO group, at 130 days of age, Fas protein was significantly
    less in the CA/CO group whereas C/EBP\u03B2 protein was increased in the CA/CO
    group.", Figure 5., 'Results of protein analyses for fatty acid synthase and CCAAT/enhancer
    binding protein, beta at 130 days of age.', "Western blot for fatty acid synthase
    showed that Fas protein was significantly less and that C/EBP, \u03B2 was not
    quite significantly higher in mammary glands of CA/CO mice than in CO/CO mice
    at 130 days.", Values shown are relative density and have been corrected for protein
    loading and for cytokeratin., The results of this study indicate that incorporation
    of canola oil in the maternal diet delayed the development of mammary gland cancer
    in this transgenic mouse model., The mice exposed to canola oil during gestation
    and lactation had significantly fewer tumors per mouse and the tumor incidence
    was 1/2 that of the control mice at 130 days of age., By 170 days of age the canola
    exposed mice had almost as many tumors as the control mice., 'However, since the
    growth rate of the tumors that developed in the canola oil exposed mice was about
    1/2 that of the control mice and the appearance of tumors was delayed, the tumor
    burden in the canola exposed mice at 170 days of age was significantly less than
    that of the control mice.', 'If these results can be extrapolated to humans they
    are important for 2 reasons: 1) incorporation of canola oil in the diet is an
    easy dietary change for humans to make and 2) the maternal diet can have a life-long
    influence on development of breast cancer in the daughter.', Epidemiologic studies
    can be interpreted to support the notion that the maternal diet can influence
    breast cancer risk in the daughter., 'When Chinese, Japanese or Filipino women
    migrate to the United States, breast cancer rates rise over two generations to
    approach that of US women .', 'Breast cancer incidence in first generation migrants
    was increased almost 3 fold over that of the Asian-born mother, but was still
    lower than that of the general Western population, indicating that there remained
    some protection from breast cancer due to the mothers traditional diet.', 'In
    second generation migrants, whose mothers consumed a Western diet during gestation
    and lactation of the daughter, breast cancer risk was 5-fold higher than the breast
    cancer risk for the Asian born grandmother  and was the same as the general Western
    population.', 'What could explain the benefit of exposure to maternal consumption
    of the omega 3 fatty acids in canola oil?', 'The fatty acid composition of the
    mammary glands was different between the two groups at 21 days of age, but by
    130 days of age there were no real differences in fatty acid composition.', 'However,
    at 130 days of age, there were significant differences in gene expression in the
    mammary glands of these mice.', The PCR array that we chose assays mRNA abundance
    in 84 key genes representative of 18 different signal transduction pathways that
    are important to the development of cancer., 'We found that there were multiple
    differences in gene expression between the 2 groups of mice when the mice were
    130 days of age, 109 days after the last exposure to the diet that contained canola
    oil.', "Among the differential changes that were of special interest was the large
    increase in CEBP\u03B2(CCAAT/enhancer binding protein \u03B2) mRNA.", Western
    blot confirmed that the mRNA was being translated to protein and that the quantity
    of protein was higher in the CA/CO group., "CEBP\u03B2 is a leucine zipper transcription
    factor.", "The expression of CEBP\u03B2 in the liver has been shown to respond
    to dietary changes .", "Homodimers and heterodimers of CEBP\u03B2 initiate transcription
    of multiple factors involved in proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis in
    the mammary gland .", "Multiple isoforms of the protein, may be generated by truncation
    or proteolysis of the CEBP\u03B2 transcript .", Slowed proliferation and increased
    differentiation could result in reduced tumor incidence while promotion of apoptosis
    could slow tumor growth., "These mechanisms are supported by the phenotypic data
    however the exact meaning of increased CEBP\u03B2 expression in the mammary gland
    in this model will require additional study.", The 7 to 8 fold decrease of fatty
    acid synthase mRNA and significant decrease in fatty acid synthase protein by
    maternal consumption of the canola oil diet is particularly interesting., Increased
    expression of fatty acid synthase has been associated with the early steps of
    human mammary carcinogenesis ., 'Conversely, inhibition of fatty acid synthase
    has been associated with apoptosis of human breast cancer cells  and has been
    suggested as a target for chemoprevention of breast cancer .', "In cell culture
    studies, \u03B1-linolenic acid has been shown to be tumoricidal to breast cancer
    cells and to inhibit the overexpression of fatty acid synthase .", The long term
    suppression of fatty acid synthase would contribute to reduced tumor burden seen
    in this model., Another gene expression change that could reduce tumor burden
    was the 13 fold increased expression of Egr1 mRNA in the CA/CO group., Egr1 is
    a tumor suppressor gene that has been associated with suppression of proliferation
    ., The expression of this gene has been shown to be increased by genistein and
    by retinoids  providing precedent for the regulation of this gene by dietary components.,
  "Even though we did not directly assess NF\u03BAB activation, the mRNA results suggest
    that activation of the transcription factor NF\u03BAB was reduced in mammary glands
    of pups from mothers that consumed the canola oil diet.", "The mRNA for inhibitor
    of \n\n\u03BAB kinase \u03B2 was reduced 3 fold in CA/CO pups at 130 days of age.",
  "Activation of IKK\u03B2 results in the phosphorylation of I\u03BAB and allows formation
    of NF\u03BAB dimers that can translocate to the nucleus and activate transcription
    of downstream genes .", "Activation of IKK\u03B2 is an important regulatory step
    in NF\u03BAB activity , thus reduced IKK\u03B2 would be expected to result in
    decreased activation of NF\u03BAB and reduction in mRNA of genes that are transcribed
    following NF\u03BAB binding.", "Genes downstream from NF\u03BAB include inducible
    nitric oxide synthase, tumor necrosis factor and vascular cell adhesion molecule
    1.", "The mRNA from each of these genes was decreased 2 to 5 fold, supporting
    the idea that NF\u03BAB activation was reduced in the CA/CO pups.", Clearly there
    is much work to be done to verify this notion and to identify mechanisms., The
    mRNA changes in the Bcl-2 apoptotic pathway were also intriguing., Progression
    to apoptosis is a balance between pro-apoptotic genes such as Bcl-2 associated
    X and anti-apoptotic genes such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-2-like-1 ., 'At 130 days of age,
    the mammary glands of CA/CO mice had BAX mRNA at 22 fold and BCL-2-like 1 at -10
    fold that of the CO/CO mice.', Bcl2 was increased 4 fold but clearly the overall
    balance is to promotion of apoptosis of defective epithelial cells in the CA/CO
    mammary glands., Clearly consumption of canola oil by mothers of the experimental
    mice delayed mammary gland tumor development in this model., Our gene expression
    data have provided clues to mechanisms employed but identifying and verifying
    the mechanism(s) remains to be done., 'Since long term changes in the expression
    of multiple proteins, such as seen in this study, are often related to epigenetic
    modification of the promoter region of genes, we have initiated epigenetic studies
    to identify these changes.', Future work includes verification of protein changes
    and developing reasonable pathways for the delay in cancer development seen in
    this model., It has been suggested that 30% or more of cancers could be prevented
    by dietary changes ., 'Substituting canola oil for corn oil would increase the
    ratio of omega 3 fatty acids in the diet and is an easy, cost effective dietary
    change for people to make.', Many animal studies have shown that increasing omega
    3 fatty acids in the adult diet provides multiple benefits against cancer., This
    work suggests that substituting canola oil for the corn oil in the maternal diet
    may decrease risk for breast cancer in the daughter in addition to providing benefit
    for the mother., "AA: arachidonic acid, a 20 carbon, n-6 PUFA with 4 unsaturations;
