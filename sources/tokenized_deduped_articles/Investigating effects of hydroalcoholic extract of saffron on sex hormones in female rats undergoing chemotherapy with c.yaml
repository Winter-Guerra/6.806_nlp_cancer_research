[Cyclophosphamide is an antineoplastic medicine that causes disorder in functions
    of the body systems., 'Thus, the purpose of this study is to investigate the effect
    of hydroalcoholic extract of saffron on improving the complications of cyclophosphamide
    on sex hormones.', 'Fifty-six adult female Wistar rats were randomly divided into
    seven groups; control, sham, experimental groups 1, 2, and 3 + hydroalcoholic
    extract of saffron, experimental group 4, and experimental group 5.', 'Cyclophosphamide
    was given intraperitoneally, and extract by gavage was prescribed for 21 days.',
  'At the end of the experiment, after blood and preparation of serum, ELISA method
    was used for measuring the estrogen, progesterone, FSH, and LH hormones.', Data
    and LSD test were analyzed with SPSS software., Results show that the concurrent
    use of low-dose cyclophosphamide and saffron extract can reduce toxic effect of
    cyclophosphamide on pituitary-gonadal axis and cause estrogen to be produced.,
  Cyclophosphamide is a major component of many effective drug compounds., 'Hence,
    it is widely used as an antineoplastic medicine for treatment of diseases such
    as malignant lymphoma, leukemia, neuroblastoma, and autoimmune diseases.', 'Despite
    the numerous clinical applications, this drug does have adverse effects, such
    as reproductive toxicity in humans and laboratory animals who are exposed to it,
    as well as the reduction and degeneration of ovarian follicles.', Cyclophosphamide
    causes delete sperm as well as biochemical and histological changes in testis
    and epididymis of rats and humans., 'The mechanism of drug effect is due to the
    connection between the two strands of DNA molecule, and the break in DNA and RNA
    also inhibits protein synthesis.', 'Chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide in patients
    with breast cancer and those who have as yet never experienced menstruation may
    suffer from chemical sterility and, in treatment of women with systemic lupus,
    this drug causes premature menstruation.', Biological compounds with antioxidant
    properties can protect cells and tissues against disturbances caused by reactive
    oxygen species and free radicals., 'Due to its various health benefits in traditional
    medicine, saffron has been the focus of much attention as a medicinal herb in
    the recent decades.', 'Saffron, with the scientific name is from the lily race,
    the main ingredients of which include crocin, crocetin, and saffranal.', 'It has
    also been reported to have anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anticancer properties.',
  'Premkumar and colleagues reported that saffron prevented DNA damage of bone marrow
    cells in laboratory mice due to antitumor drug consumption named sin platinum,
    cyclophosphamide, and mitomycin.', 'So based on the abovementioned information,
    the objective of this study is to investigate the effect of saffron hydroalcoholic
    extract on improving complications due to cyclophosphamide on sex hormones rate
    in female rats.', This is an experimental study., 'In this research, 56 adult
    female Wistar rats, approximately 10 weeks of age change used by experimented.',
  "Rats were kept at 24 \xB1 2 \xB0C temperature and in photoperiod of 12 h light
    and 12 h dark, with free access to food and water.", 'First, the rats were randomly
    divided into seven groups of eight control, sham group, experimental groups 1,
    2, and 3 + saffron hydroalcoholic extract with doses), experimental group 4, and
    experimental group 5.', 'Cyclophosphamide was given intraperitoneally, and the
    extract was prescribed by gavage for 21 days.', "At the end of the experiment,
    the animals were comatosed with ether and, after blooding, samples were collected
    in sterile plastic tubes and held for 20 min at room temperature, then centrifuged
    for 15 min at 3,000 rpm and the serum separated and stored at \u221230 \xB0C.",
  'The ELISA method was then used for the evaluation of the estrogen, progesterone,
    FSH, and LH hormones.', 'Statistical data analysis: The results were analyzed
    using SPSS software version 15 and one-way ANOVA and LSD statistical test.', The
    average and standard deviations were calculated and graphs were plotted by the
    Excel software., 'The results of this study show that the average concentration
    of the estrogen, progesterone, and LH hormones in the cyclophosphamide-receiving
    group, concentration of the progesterone hormone in the experimental group 1,
    and concentration of the hormone FSH in the experimental group 3 shows a significant
    decrease in comparison with the control group.', 'However, in the experimental
    group 3, there is a significant increase in the concentration of the estrogen
    hormone.', 'In the experimental groups 1, 2, 3, and 4, there is a decrease in
    serum level LH compared with the control group, which is seen just in group 1.',
  In all graphs asterisk indicates a significant difference between the groups with
    the control group., 'In cyclophosphamide-induced reproductive toxicity via oxidative
    stress, prescribing antioxidant will decrease toxicity.', The ability of phosphamide
    in the production of free radicals has been reported in rats., 'In this study,
    concentration of the estrogen, progesterone, and FSH hormones in the cyclophosphamide-receiving
    group has a significant decrease in comparison with the control group; however,
    no significant difference with the control group is seen in concentration of the
    LH hormone in this group.', Studies indicate that metabolites of cyclophosphamide
    can be produced to reduce steroid hormones in granulose cells., 'However, women
    who were treated with cyclophosphamide did not experience a decrease in estrogen
    and progesterone plasma.', 'In another study, decreased granulosa cell survival
    in mice treated with cyclophosphamide and save progesterone have been reported.',
  'Studies show that women who have been treated with cyclophosphamide may have reproductive
    disorders, amenorrhea, and increased number of atretic follicles and decreased
    plasma levels of progesterone and estrogen experience.', 'Also, cyclophosphamide
    can affect DNA, break it, and also have an effect on RNA and decrease protein
    synthesis.', 'Probably, in the experimental group 5, the structure of FSH, which
    is polypeptide and the effect of active metabolites of cyclophosphamide, the phosphorus
    amide mustard, and acrulyn on the anterior pituitary or hypothalamus that regulate
    folicogenesis, cause the decrease in serum FSH level, followed by a reduction
    of estrogen, which can also be explained by the toxic effect of cyclophosphamide
    on ovaries.', These findings are in agreement with the results of other researchers.,
  'It is likely that in the experimental group 3, due to the destructive effects of
    active metabolites of cyclophosphamide on the analysis of the corpus luteum and
    destruction of granulose cells, in addition to the destruction of the harmful
    effects of high doses of saffron, ovarian tissue will also be affected by cyclophosphamide
    metabolites and destructive effects of saffron, thus accelerating analysis of
    the corpus luteum and increasing estrogen and progesterone.', 'In one study, Mokhtari
    and colleagues found that saffron hydroalcoholic extract causes an increase in
    estrogen concentration.', 'The protective effect of saffron as a result of the
    chemicals in the antioxidants and reaction with free radicals can increase the
    serum concentration of estrogen in the experimental groups 1, 2, and 4 in comparison
    with the experimental group 5, and the effects of cyclophosphamide metabolites
    can be partially alleviated.', Significant decrease in the progesterone serum
    level in the experimental group 1 compared with the control group may be a result
    of the appropriate dose of saffron., 'Premkumar and his colleagues reported the
    effect of saffron on changes in lipid peroxidation and antioxidant status in spite
    of sin platinum, cyclophosphamide, mitomycin, and urea in mice to investigate
    and found that the administration of saffron, lipid peroxidation, reduced antioxidant
    enzyme, and enzymatic of liver increase, so saffron may be through its effect
    on lipid peroxidation, antioxidants, and detoxification systems of genotoxic effects
    induced by antitumor drugs to prevent.', 'In the experimental groups 1, 2, 3,
    and 4, a decrease in serum FSH level is seen which, when compared to the control
    group, is not significant in other groups except for the experimental group 3.',
  'Crocin is probably due to the protective properties against chemical materials,
    which inhibit the reaction of free radicals, induction of apoptosis, and inhibition
    of tumor growth by interfering with DNA structure and function; it could prevent
    the effects of acrulyn and phosphorus amide mustard and increase serum FSH level
    in the experimental groups 1, 2, and 3 compared to group 5.', Saffron is highly
    toxic in large quantities., 'It is also reported that saffron consumption in high
    doses can cause miscarriage, so despite the beneficial effects of saffron, it
    should be used in an appropriate dose.', According to Fig., '3 and probably in
    the experimental group 4 due to high dose, saffron extract did not have a protective
    effect on ovaries, so there is no expected increase in serum level in the experimental
    group 4.', 'Prescribing saffron with an appropriate dose during chemotherapy for
    reducing stress and detoxification due to the prescription of cyclophosphamide,
    appears to make tissue detoxification necessary.', 'In other words, concurrent
    prescription of antioxidants and cyclophosphamide will decrease the incidence
    of reproductive toxicity.']
