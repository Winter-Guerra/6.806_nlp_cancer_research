[The major obstacles to the successful use of individual nutritional compounds as
    preventive or therapeutic agents are their efficacy and bioavailability., One
    approach to overcoming this problem is to use combinations of nutrients to induce
    synergistic effects., 'The objective of this research was to investigate the synergistic
    effects of two dietary components: docosahexaenoic acid, an omega-3 fatty acid
    present in cold-water fish, and curcumin, an herbal nutrient present in turmeric,
    in an in vivo model of DMBA-induced mammary tumorigenesis in mice.', 'We used
    the carcinogen DMBA to induce breast tumors in SENCAR mice on control, CCM, DHA,
    or DHA + CCM diets.', Appearance and tumor progression were monitored daily.,
  The tumors were harvested 15 days following their first appearance for morphological
    and immunohistological analysis., Western analysis was performed to determine
    expression of maspin and survivin in the tumor tissues., Characterization of tumor
    growth was analyzed using appropriate statistical methods., "Otherwise all other
    results are reported as mean \xB1 SD and analyzed with one-way ANOVA and Tukey\u2019s
    post hoc procedure.", "Analysis of gene microarray data indicates that combined
    treatment with DHA + CCM altered the profile of \u201CPAM50\u201D genes in the
    SK-BR-3 cell line from an ER-/Her-2+ to that resembling a \u201Cnormal-like\u201D
    phenotype.", 'The in vivo studies demonstrated that DHA + CCM treatment reduced
    the incidence of breast tumors, delayed tumor initiation, and reduced progression
    of tumor growth.', 'Dietary treatment had no effect on breast size development,
    but tumors from mice on a control diet were less differentiated than tumors from
    mice fed CCM or DHA + CCM diets.', 'The synergistic effects also led to increased
    expression of the pro-apoptotic protein, maspin, but reduced expression of the
    anti-apoptotic protein, survivin.', 'The SK-BR-3 cells and DMBA-induced tumors,
    both with an ER- and Her-2+ phenotype, were affected by the synergistic interaction
    of DHA and CCM.', This suggests that the specific breast cancer phenotype is an
    important factor for predicting efficacy of these nutraceuticals., 'The combination
    of DHA and CCM is potentially a dietary supplemental treatment for some breast
    cancers, likely dependent upon the molecular phenotype of the cancer.', 'In vivo

    The idea that dietary changes or diet supplementation may improve the health of
    cancer patients or enhance the effectiveness of existing treatments is compelling
    motivation for exploring the activities of dietary compounds.', 'Although natural
    products are a promising addition to current toxic anti-cancer drugs, major obstacles
    exist to the successful use of individual nutritional compounds as preventive
    or therapeutic agents: efficacy and bioavailability.', One approach to overcoming
    these problems is to use combinations of nutrients with synergistic effects.,
  'Given that the human diet consists of multiple nutrients, it is likely that nutrients
    in the diet act synergistically to provide health benefits.', 'In fact, human
    diets can routinely encompass many biologically active small molecules, and evidence
    for synergy between dietary compounds is emerging .', The translational benefit
    for such molecules derives from a relative lack of toxic side effects and source
    material that is inexpensive and easily accessible relative to synthetic pharmaceuticals.,
  'The objective of the present research is to establish synergistic interaction with
    a combination of Docosahexaenoic acid, an omega-3 PUFA found in fish oil, and
    curcumin, a phenolic molecule found in turmeric, on breast cancer growth.', Docosahexaenoic
    acid is the most unsaturated of the fatty acids commonly found in biological systems.,
  'Early epidemiological evidence strongly links fish oil with a low incidence of
    several types of cancer, including breast cancer .', "In addition to strong epidemiological
    studies, dietary studies have also substantiated DHA\u2019s role as an anti-cancer
    agent for breast cancer .", Curcumin  has been frequently used in South Asian
    medicine since the second millennium BCE., 'Coincidently, a recent study reported
    that breast cancer rates in India were significantly lower than in Western countries,
    including the US .', 'Preclinical studies have revealed growth-inhibitory potential
    of curcumin in several cancers, including colon, duodenal, stomach, prostate,
    and breast .', Breast cancer is a myriad of diseases with multiple phenotypes.,
  'Clinically, breast cancers are subdivided according to estrogen receptor and oncogenic
    Her-2 status.', Progesterone receptor is another molecular marker that is also
    used to predict a lack of response to hormone therapy ., 'More recent studies
    using global gene expression profiling with widely available microarray techniques
    describe distinct molecular subtypes of breast cancer, each defined by a large
    number of genes .', 'These include basal-like, Her2-enriched, normal-like, luminal
    A, and luminal B subtypes.', "This classification has been further refined and
    now utilizes a set of 50 representative genes known as \u201CPAM50\u201D genes
    .", 'Those classifications also parallel the established clinical- and histological-based
    classifications, with basal-like representing ER-/Her2-cancers, Her-2 enriched
    representing ER-/Her2+, and normal-like and luminal A/B subtypes representing
    ER+.', 'With this diverse classification, it would be expected that a particular
    therapeutic agent or dietary supplement might not be effective for all malignant
    subtypes.', 'Although there is a debate about the advantage of molecular signature
    classification over existing surface receptor classification , the molecular signature
    may provide more in-depth knowledge about the progression of disease or response
    to treatment.', 'In a previous study, we used 5 breast cell lines covering distinct
    receptor expression phenotypes: MDA-MB-231, SK-BR-3, MCF7, MDA-MB-361, and MCF10AT
    .', 'Across these cell lines, the synergistic anti-proliferative effects of CCM,
    DHA, and a DHA + CCM combination were assessed quantitatively as described by
    Tallarida .', "Our data demonstrated that the combination of DHA + CCM, when less
    than 50 \u03BCM, exerted a synergistic effect only in the SK-BR-3 breast cancer
    cell line.", "Detection of anti-proliferation synergy for DHA + CCM within the
    SK-BR-3 cell line was followed by transcript analysis using the Agilent Whole
    Human Genome Microarray 4\xD744K platform.", The microarray data and corresponding
    step-by-step analysis is posted as supplementary data on the BMC-Cancer web site
    ., 'The data demonstrate that the expression of genes involved in apoptosis, inhibition
    of metastasis, and cell adhesion were upregulated, whereas genes involved in cancer
    development and progression, metastasis, and cell cycle progression were downregulated
    .', 'Furthermore, a significant 20- to 100-fold increase in CYP450 class-1, a
    nearly 20-fold upregulation of SERPINB5, and a 60% downregulation of BIRC5 gene
    expression are of special functional interest.', 'CYP450 proteins are involved
    in the metabolism of estrogen, activation/inactivation of carcinogens, and enhancement
    of the anti-proliferative effects of polyphenols .', 'SERPINB5 protein is a pro-apoptotic
    tumor suppressor that is completely suppressed in most breast cancers but is re-expressed
    on anti-cancer treatment , whereas the BIRC5 protein, belongs to the Inhibitors
    of Apoptosis Protein family, which is mostly absent from well-differentiated,
    normal adult tissues, but is over-expressed in nearly all human cancers .', The
    fact that only the SK-BR-3 cell line was synergistically affected by DHA and CCM
    suggests that specific breast cancer phenotype is an important factor for predicting
    efficacy., "We used the microarray data to further analyze and understand the
    response of dietary treatments on \u201CPAM50\u201D genes.", 'We made initial
    attempts to test the synergism between DHA and CCM in a xenograft model of the
    SK-BR-3 cell line; however, we were not able to grow the SK-BR-3 xenograft in
    nude mice because of low tumorigenic potential of SK-BR-3 cells.', 'Therefore,

  'We selected the same genes from our microarray data and arranged them in a similar
    manner, as described by Creighton .', 'We found that the gene signature of SK-BR-3
    cell lines resembled the ER-/Her-2+ tumor profile, further confirming our SK-BR-3

    changed the expression of a number of genes.', "DHA, however, appears to be acting
    as a modulator of the effects of CCM, and it is very intriguing to observe that

    The data presented in Figure 2 demonstrate that a DHA or CCM diet alone did not
    reduce the incidence of tumor occurrence in mice, whereas the combined DHA diet
    with CCM significantly delayed tumor initiation and also significantly reduced
    the incidence of breast tumor in mice.', 'The data presented in Table 4 indicate
    that about 73% of mice on the corn oil and corn oil + CCM diets developed tumors,
    and mice on the DHA diet yielded a tumor incidence of 67%.', 'However, only 27%
    of animals developed tumors when on the DHA + CCM diet.', 'There was no statistical
    difference in the number of tumors per animal within corn oil, CCM, and DHA groups;
    however, there were significantly fewer breast tumors per animal when treatment
    with DHA and CCM was combined.', 'In addition, the average tumor mass in the DHA
    + CCM group was also significantly less compared to other groups.', 'Furthermore,
    the length of time for the initial tumor to appear in animals fed DHA + CCM was
    significantly longer than that of animals fed control, DHA, or CCM diets.', 'The
    DHA, CCM, or DHA + CCM treatment was non-toxic, based on the lack of significant

    sizes., We further investigated if the carcinogen or diet had any influence on
    normal mouse breast development by preparing breast whole mounts., The total length
    of breast tissue per gram body weight did not differ significantly among the dietary
    groups with or without DMBA-induced tumors., The total width of breast tissue
    per gram body weight was not significantly different within DMBA-induced or non-DMBA
    treated animals., 'However, the total width of breast tissue per gram body weight
    was significantly reduced in animals with CCM or DHA + CCM treatment only in the
    DMBA-tumor group, whereas the total width of breast tissue per gram body weight
    was not different on these treatments in non-DMBA induced animals.', We also looked
    at the morphological features of the whole breast mount from animals on different
    dietary groups., The mammary ducts in control animals with DMBA-induced tumors
    exhibited less differentiation of the gland with substantial reduction in the
    density of terminal end buds compared to animals fed the other diets., 'Animals
    on CCM or DHA diets also had some reduction in TEB density compared to control
    non-tumor-bearing animals, whereas animals on DHA + CCM diets had well differentiated
    breast tissues and the TEB density was similar to that of control, non-DMBA-induced
    animals.', 'In addition, we also looked for the presence of proliferative regions
    where the alveolar buds showed extensive staining.', Data presented in Figure
    5 show that control animals had an average of 1.3 proliferative lesions per breast.,
  DHA treatment did not affect the number of the proliferative lesions., 'Although
    non-significant, the CCM diet reduced proliferative lesions to 40%, and a DHA
    + CCM diet substantially reduced proliferative lesions to 20%.', 'However, the
    total tumor burden, estimated by adding the palpable tumor and proliferative lesion
    in each breast tissue showed a significant 50% reduction in breast tissue from
    animals fed a DHA + CCM diet compared to the control group.', Figure 4., Effect

  "The tissues were observed under a dissecting microscope at 20\xD7 magnification
    and the hyper-proliferative regions in the entire breast tissue were recorded.",
  The basic morphological features of tumors were evaluated using H&amp;E stain.,
  'The data presented in Figure 6 indicate that control animals on a corn oil diet
    largely developed adenosquamous and ductal carcinomas, with few tumors showing
    adenocarcinoma type A.', 'Animals fed a curcumin diet developed mostly ductal
    carcinoma and carcinosarcoma, with some tumor showing features of adenocarcinoma
    type A, whereas only few tumors were adenosquamous carcinoma or mixed carcinoma

    PR proteins in immunohistological slides is shown in Table 3, which indicates
    that DHA + CCM treatment caused a significant 7.5-fold increase in the expression
    of ER in tumors, whereas none of the other treatments had any effect on the expression
    of ER, Her-2, or PR.', Figure 7., 'Effect of diets on the estrogen receptor, Her-2

    data indicated a 20-fold increase in SERPINB5 expression and a 60% reduction in
    BIRC5 genes in SK-BR-3 cells treated with DHA + CCM compared to the control cells.',
  'We, therefore, analyzed the expression of maspin and survivin in tumors from different
    dietary treatments.', 'As demonstrated in Figure 8 using two representative tumors,
    maspin was absent or expressed at a very low level in a majority of tumors in
    animals fed either a control or DHA diet; however, a substantial amount of maspin
    was expressed in tumors from mice fed a CCM diet, and its expression was further
    stimulated in tumors from DHA + CCM fed animals.', 'In contrast, considerable
    survivin expression was observed in tumors from animals fed a control diet, a
    DHA-enriched diet, or a CCM-enriched diet.', 'However, DHA + CCM treatment caused
    nearly a 50% reduction in survivin expression in the tumors.', Figure 8., Effect

    of maspin and survivin was detected using specific anti-maspin and anti-survivin
    antibodies., "Blots were probed with \u03B2-actin antibodies for monitoring sample
    loading.", Blots represent two representative tumors from each group., 'About
    41% of all newly approved drugs are estimated to have a nutritional/natural product
    origin, and about 60% of these are anti-cancer drugs .', 'However, it is becoming
    apparent that the major obstacles to the successful use of individual nutritional
    compounds as preventive or therapeutic agents are their efficacy and bioavailability.',
  One approach to overcoming this problem is to use combinations of nutrients to induce
    synergistic effects., "Traditionally, nutritional compounds in \u201Cfolk medicine\u201D
    are used in unmodified form, as concentrated extracts.", 'Given that the human
    diet consists of multiple nutrients, dietary nutrients likely act synergistically
    to provide health benefits.', "Centuries ago Hippocrates stated, \u201CLet food
    be thy medicine, and let thy medicine be food.\"", 'DHA and CCM are natural non-toxic
    nutrients that have anti-cancer properties; however, their use as individual compounds
    is not very efficacious.', 'Therefore, we tested the possibility that they could
    act synergistically.', 'In our previously published in vitro studies, we used
    5 breast cell lines covering distinct receptor expression phenotypes: MDA-MB-231,
    SK-BR-3, MCF7, MDA-MB-361, and MCF10AT.', 'We found that SK-BR-3, an ER-/Her-2+
    cell line, responded synergistically to the DHA + CCM combined treatment .', "We
    further demonstrated that the synergistic effects of DHA and CCM were mediated
    through the activation of NF\u03BAB and the expression of PPAR\u03B3.", 'As outlined
    in the introduction, our gene microarray data showed that expression of genes
    involved in apoptosis, inhibition of metastasis, and cell adhesion were upregulated,
    whereas genes involved in cancer development and progression, metastasis, and
    cell cycle progression were downregulated on the combined DHA + CCM treatment.',
  Those data suggested that this differential gene expression by the combined treatment
    could be effective in limiting growth of cancerous cells., "In addition, we further
    analyzed the \u201CPAM50\u201D subset of genes to validate the breast cancer signature
    profile of SK-BR-3 cell lines and to determine if this signature profile changes
    in response to the combined DHA + CCM treatment.", 'As expected, the untreated
    SK-BR-3 cells showed a signature pattern for ER-, Her-2+ tumors.', "Importantly,
    we found that DHA + CCM treatment transformed the PAM50 gene signature profile
    towards a \u201Cnormal-like\u201D profile with significant ER expression.", This
    observation indicates that these compounds act synergistically to transform a
    highly undifferentiated tumor into a differentiated form., "We speculate that
    this concept of chemically changing the gene profile of tumor into \u201Cnormal-like\u201D
    tissue will open new avenues to identify the key target genes that may transform
    a neoplastic cell into a normal cell.", The concept of changing cellular structure
    and function has been published when a differentiated cell was transformed into
    a stem cell by introducing 4 key genes ., It is possible that a reverse approach
    may have high potential for the treatment of tumors., 'In our previous studies
    on SK-BR-3 cells, we realized that treating breast cancer cells in vitro with
    a combination of DHA + CCM may reflect a similar response in vivo.', 'We, therefore,
    further extended our studies in an in vivo model of breast cancer.', We initially
    used a xenograft model of SK-BR-3 tumors in nude mice., 'Because of the low tumorigenic
    potential of SK-BR-3 cells, these studies could not be completed.', 'We, therefore,
    used a DMBA-inducible breast cancer model to determine the effects of DHA, CCM,
    and DHA + CCM.', 'Interestingly, the DMBA-induced breast cancer model in SENCAR
    mice has been shown by others  and validated by us, to exhibit a phenotype similar
    to that of SK-BR-3 cells .', 'Therefore, our in vivo model closely resembled our
    in vitro breast cancer cell model.', The data presented in Figure 2 demonstrate
    that DHA in combination with CCM delays tumor initiation and reduces the incidence
    of breast tumors in mice., 'Morphologically, breast tumors in the DHA + CCM group
    appeared to be more differentiated then control tumors.', 'Additionally, the single
    treatment with either DHA or CCM did not alter the TEB, which were similar to
    the non-tumor control.', 'No apparent difference was found in the size of normal
    breast tissue in any dietary group, indicating that diet itself has no effect
    on the development of breast.', 'In contrast, breast tissue width was significantly
    reduced in DMBA-induced animals fed a CCM or DHA + CCM diet.', 'This indicates
    a possible interaction of DMBA with CCM, but it is not clear if this reduction
    in breast width has any pathological implications.', Both DMBA and CCM are metabolized
    to their active metabolites by cytochrome P450 class 1 enzymes ., The expression
    of these enzymes is directly regulated by the activation of Aryl hydrocarbon receptor.,
  Both CCM and DMBA bind to AhR to induce expression of CYP40-class-1 enzymes ., 'It
    is, therefore, possible that CCM and DMBA may have interacted at the AhR-CYP450-1
    axis and that agonist vs antagonist effects of DMBA and CCM may have some growth
    inhibitory effects on breast development.', The role of CCM and DMBA on AhR activation
    and the metabolism of CCM and DMBA clearly require further investigation., Histological
    examination of the breast tumors allowed us to subclassify them into multiple
    types., 'The most common tumor type in control- or CCM-treated animals was ductal
    carcinoma; however, the tumors that developed on a DHA or DHA + CCM diet appeared
    to be largely an adenosquamous type with marked central keratinization.', The
    expression of keratin is a differentiation marker of epithelial cells and plays
    an essential role in the malignant behavior of breast tumors ., Nearly 80% of
    breast carcinomas exhibit a loss of the differentiation-associated keratin 8 and
    18 have generally been associated with a worse prognosis ., 'Breast cancer cells
    become more aggressive and malignant with the loss of keratin as these proteins
    are replaced with vimentin, the intermediate filaments-protein of mesenchymal
    cells .', Experiments by Buhler demonstrated that highly invasive MDA-MB-231 breast
    cancer cells became less invasive and lacked tumorigenicity in nude mice with
    overexpression of keratin 18 ., 'It is, therefore, possible that DHA or DHA +
    CCM treatment may have transformed DMBA-induced tumors toward a more differentiated,
    less aggressive subtype.', 'Furthermore, immune histological analysis of tumor
    tissues indicates that the DMBA-induced tumors were ER-negative and Her-2 positive,
    further validating the reported observations.', 'We observed that DHA + CCM treatment
    caused a significant expression of ER in DMBA-induced tumors, further validating
    our observation of microarray data in SK-BR-3 cells.', Reversal of the estrogen
    negative to the estrogen positive phenotype has previously been described ., This
    observation also suggests that the combined treatment has induced differentiation
    in breast tumors., 'We have not been able to further characterize keratin or ER
    levels in these tumors due to scarcity of the tissue; however, these observations
    also need further investigation.', One of the observations from our microarray
    data was the approximately 20-fold upregulation of SERPINB5 and almost 60% downregulation
    of BIRC5 genes., 'SERPINB5 produces maspin, a tumor suppressor protein present
    in high concentrations in normal mammary epithelium and myoepithelium cells; maspin
    expression is reduced in primary breast cancers and is completely absent in invasive
    and metastatic tumor cells .', Data shown in Figure 8 indicate that maspin was
    absent or expressed at low levels in the tumors of control or DHA-fed animals.,
  'CCM treatment caused reexpression of maspin, and this expression appears to be
    further enhanced by the combined DHA + CCM diet.', Reexpression of maspin in response
    to curcumin has previously been shown in breast cancer cells by Parsad et al.,
  ., Maspin is a key regulatory molecule for the normal mammary gland and embryonic
    development ., 'The expression of SERPINB5 is regulated at the transcriptional
    level through elements in the maspin promoter, particularly by p53 .', 'Maspin
    is present in the cytoplasm, but it translocates to the mitochondria and inhibits
    tumor progression through the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway .', 'Analysis of
    the microarray data for caspase-mediated downstream processes in SK-BR-3 cells,
    as shown in Figure 9, indicates that maspin expression was linked to the activation
    of a number of caspases involved in apoptosis.', 'Additionally, maspin has also
    been shown to induce cell differentiation, which further contributes to its anti-cancer
    effects .', "Furthermore, PPAR\u03B3 induced mammary cell differentiation, which
    is also accompanied by enhanced maspin expression ; however, it is not known if
    PPAR\u03B3 directly regulates maspin expression in cancer cells.", Figure 9.,
  Analysis of microarray data from SK-BR-3 cell line for interaction of maspin up-
    and down-stream mediators., 'The microarray data from SK-BR-3 cell treatment with
    DHA, CCM, and DHA + CCM was used to determine the interaction of maspin with up-
    and down-regulatory mediators using MetaCoreTM version 6.3.', 'The interactions
    indicate maspin is regulated upstream by p53, whereas maspin is linked to activation
    of a number of caspase activities downstream for its prominent role in the induction
    of apoptosis.', 'BIRC5 produces survivin, the smallest member of the inhibitor
    of the apoptosis protein family, which acts not only to inhibit apoptosis but
    also to control cell cycle progression .', 'Survivin is largely expressed in developing
    embryos and proliferating hematopoietic, epithelial, and gonadal cells .', 'It
    is mostly absent from well differentiated normal adult tissues, but hyperplasic
    regions of normal tissues often show some expression; however, survivin overexpression
    has been reported in nearly all human cancers, including breast cancer .', Data
    presented in Figure 8 indicate that DMBA-induced tumors expressed substantial
    levels of survivin., 'These levels were not affected by DHA or CCM treatment,
    but a combined treatment caused almost a 50% reduction in survivin expression.',
  Disrupting survivin expression or function in cancer cells has been shown to decrease
    cell proliferation by enhancing apoptosis., Survivin has been considered an effective
    target for anticancer strategies in several preclinical and early-phase clinical
    trials ., Factors that are involved in regulating maspin re-expression are also
    involved in regulating survivin expression., 'For example, nuclear factor kappaB
    upregulates survivin expression , whereas p53 and retinoblastoma protein are required
    to repress survivin transcription .', 'More recently, Verhagen et al.', reported
    that mutations of the p53 gene in breast carcinoma significantly correlate with
    an enhanced expression of survivin ., "In addition, PPAR\u03B3 reduces levels
    of survivin in different cancer types, including breast cancer .", "Previously,
    we demonstrated that DHA and CCM synergistically cause activation of p53 and upregulation
    of PPAR\u03B3 expression.", "Based on these observations, it is possible that
    the effects of CCM + DHA on p53 activation and/or PPAR\u03B3 expression cause
    suppression of the anti-apoptotic protein, survivin, with increased expression
    of maspin, a tumor suppressor protein.", 'This effect would lead to the inhibition
    of cell cycle progression and to the induction of apoptosis, thereby inhibiting
    tumor progression.', "Clearly, additional experiments are needed to confirm a
    role of p53 and/or PPAR\u03B3 on maspin re-expression and survivin suppression.",
  Figure 10., The proposed signaling pathways for the synergistic effects of DHA and
    CCM on progression., "One possible mechanism for the effects of CCM, DHA or CCM
    + DHA on p53 activation and/or PPAR\u03B3 expression is to suppress the anti-apoptotic
    protein, survivin, while increasing the expression of maspin, a tumor-suppressor
    protein.", 'This situation could lead to the induction of apoptosis, thereby inhibiting
    tumor progression.', One limitation of this study is the low levels of linoleic
    acid in DHA and DHA + CCM diets., High levels of linoleic acid have been shown
    to stimulate breast cancer ., It is unlikely that low levels of linoleic acid
    have any effect on the growth or number of breast tumors since the DHA diet itself
    was not very effective., 'However, it is possible that reduced linoleic acid with
    CCM may have played a role in the synergistic effect of the DHA + CMM diet on
    breast tumor formation.', 'Clearly, further investigation is required to determine
    the combined effect of a reduced level of linoleic and CCM on breast cancer growth.',
  The data from this in vitro study is consistent with our previously published study.,
  The results of this study further demonstrated that the synergistic effects of DHA
    + CCM were evident both under in vitro and in vivo conditions., 'SK-BR-3 cells
    and DMBA-induced tumors, both with ER- and Her-2+ characteristics, were synergistically
    affected by DHA and CCM, which suggests that the specific breast cancer phenotype
    is an important factor for predicting efficacy.', One possible mechanism for the
    synergistic effects of DHA + CCM on ER-/Her-2+ breast tumors involves the re-expression
    of maspin and the suppression of survivin., "BIRC5: Baculoviral inhibitor of apoptosis
