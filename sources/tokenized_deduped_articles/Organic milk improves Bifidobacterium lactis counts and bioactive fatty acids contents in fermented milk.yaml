["In functional dairy products, polyunsaturated fatty acids such as, conjugated linoleic
    acid and \xCE\xB1-linolenic acid have been highlighted for their benefits related
    to prevention of some chronic diseases.", 'In order to study the effect of type
    of milk, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp.', "lactis counts, acidification activity
    and chemical composition were investigated before fermentation and after 24 h
    of products stored at 4 \xB0C.", 'Organic and conventional milk influenced acidification
    performance and bacteria counts, which was strain-dependent.', 'Higher counts
    of BB12 were observed in organic milk, whereas superior counts of BL04 were found
    in conventional milk.', Organic fermented milk showed lower levels in saturated
    fatty acids and higher in monounsaturated FA contents., "Similarly, among bioactive
    FA, organic fermented milks have higher amounts of trans vaccenic acid, conjugated
    linoleic acid and slightly higher contents of \xCE\xB1-linoleic acid."]
