[Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer affecting women in North America
    and Europe., More than 85% of breast cancers are sporadic and attributable to
    long-term exposure to small quantities of multiple carcinogens., "To understand
    how multiple carcinogens act together to induce cellular carcinogenesis, we studied
    the activity of environmental carcinogens 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-bu\u200Btanone(NNK)
    and benzopyrene, and dietary carcinogen 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazop\u200Byridine(PhIP)
    using our breast cell carcinogenesis model.", 'Our study revealed, for the first
    time, that combined NNK and BP enhanced breast cell carcinogenesis chronically
    induced by PhIP in both non-cancerous and cancerous breast cells.', Co-exposure
    was more potent than sequential exposure to combined NNK and BP followed by PhIP
    in inducing carcinogenesis., 'Initiation of carcinogenesis was measured by transient
    endpoints induced in a single exposure, while progression of carcinogenesis was
    measured by acquisition of constitutive endpoints in cumulative exposures.', 'Transient
    endpoints included DNA damage, Ras-Erk-Nox pathway activation, reactive oxygen
    species elevation, and increased cellular proliferation.', 'Constitutive endpoints
    included various cancer-associated properties and signaling modulators, as well
    as enrichment of cancer stem-like cell population and activation of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal
    transition program.', 'Using transient and constitutive endpoints as targets,
    we detected that a combination of the green tea catechins ECG and EGCG, at non-cytotoxic
    levels, was more effective than individual agents in intervention of cellular
    carcinogenesis induced by combined NNK, BP, and PhIP.', 'Thus, use of combined
    ECG and EGCG should be seriously considered for early intervention of breast cell
    carcinogenesis associated with long-term exposure to environmental and dietary
    carcinogens.', 'Citation: Pluchino LA, Wang H-CR Chronic Exposure to Combined

    BP can enhance the ability of PhIP to induce breast epithelial cell carcinogenesis,
    even though NNK is not considered a mammary carcinogen, and BP is considered a
    weak mammary carcinogen.', Co-exposure to these carcinogens is more potent than
    pre-exposure to induce cellular acquisition of cancer-associated properties.,
  The constitutive biochemical endpoints of Ras-Erk-Nox pathway activation and ROS
    elevation were induced consistently with constitutive cellular endpoints and may
    play important roles in maintaining cancer-associated properties in NBP-exposed
    cells., 'To verify roles the Erk pathway and ROS may play in NBP-exposed cells,
    we used U0126 to inhibit Mek and NAC to inhibit ROS in NB20/P20 and NBP20 cells.',
  'Treatment with U0126 did not affect H-Ras expression but reduced Erk activity,
    Nox-1 expression, ROS level, and cell proliferation, indicating that the Erk-Nox
    pathway plays an important role in maintaining ROS production and cell proliferation
    in both NB20/P20 and NBP20 cells.', 'NAC treatment suppressed the Ras-Erk-Nox
    pathway, ROS level, and cell proliferation, indicating an essential role for ROS
    production in maintaining activated Ras-Erk-Nox pathway and increased cell proliferation.',
  'The results reveal a cross-talk between the Ras-Erk-Nox pathway and ROS production,
    which are necessary for maintaining increased cell proliferation, and possibly
    other cancer-associated properties, in NBP-exposed cells.', 'Mammary stem-like
    cells are able to self-renew in serum-free media, are known to exhibit high levels
    of ALDH activity, and have a unique ability to form discrete spheroid clusters
    called mammospheres in non-adherent cultures , .', We have reported that enrichment
    of ALDH-positive cell populations and increased formation of mammospheres were
    induced by cumulative exposures to NB  or PhIP  in MCF10A cells., 'However, increased
    stem-like cell population is not yet fully appreciated as a breast cancer-associated
    property.', 'Growth of mammospheres involves the properties of RDGF and AIG, both
    of which are enhanced by NBP exposure.', 'Thus, it was important to understand
    whether NBP-enhanced cellular carcinogenesis was accompanied by enhanced stem-like
    cell properties.', 'As shown in Figure 2, mammospheres and ALDH-positive cell
    population were increasingly induced in NB20, P20, NB20/P20, and NBP20 cells.',
  'Accordingly, cumulative co-exposures of cells to NBP resulted in acquisition of
    significantly increased stem-like cell populations that should be considered a
    novel cancer-associated property used to measure the progression of breast cell
    carcinogenesis.', Figure 2., Enhanced acquisition of mesenchymal and stem-like

    of the EMT program ., 'During EMT, reduction of epithelial cellular adhesion molecule

    in matrix metalloproteinase-9 is involved in degradation of the extracellular
    matrix ; increased Vimentin plays a role in filament formation and cell motility

    were increased in NB- and/or PhIP-exposed cells, and these changes occurred consistently
    with degrees of increased mammosphere formation and enriched ALDH-positive stem-like
    cell populations.', Induction of the EMT program has been postulated to not only
    contribute to cellular acquisition of stem-like properties but also increased
    migratory and invasive capabilities ., 'We detected that increased degrees of
    cell migration and invasion were closely correlated with the increased degrees
    of mammosphere formation, stem-like cell population, and EMT markers acquired
    by NB- and/or PhIP-exposed cells: NBP20&gt; NB20/P20&gt;P20&gt; NB20.', 'In addition,
    using a wound healing assay, we detected that increased cell motility was also
    accordingly acquired by these NB- and/or PhIP-exposed cells.', These results indicate
    that cumulative exposure to NBP significantly enhanced cellular acquisition of
    stem-like and EMT-associated markers and properties., Cellular acquisition of
    stem-like and EMT-associated properties should be considered as novel cancer-associated
    properties and constitutive endpoints in measurement of the progression of breast
    cell carcinogenesis., 'To clarify whether the enhanced acquisition of cancer-associated
    properties induced by NBP was limited to estrogen receptor-negative MCF10A cells,
    we exposed ER-positive human breast cancer MCF7 cells to NBP, NB, and PhIP.',
  'A single exposure to NBP induced more DNA damage in MCF7 cells than either NB or
    PhIP, indicating NBP is more potent than either NB or PhIP alone to induce DNA
    damage for cellular carcinogenesis, even in cancer cells.', 'After five cycles
    of carcinogen exposure, we detected significantly increased degrees of the cancer-associated
    properties of RDGF, AIG, cell migration, and invasion acquired by carcinogen-exposed
    MCF7 cells versus parental cells.', 'Although parental MCF7 cells possessed levels
    of these cancer-associated properties comparable to levels in NBP20 and MCF10A-Ras
    cells, these properties were significantly increased by NBP exposure, indicating
    that cumulative exposures to NBP may increase the potency of already cancerous
    cells.', 'NBP was more potent than NB or PhIP in MCF7 cells, which is consistent
    with results seen in MCF10A cells.', 'We next investigated if cumulative exposures
    to NBP, NB, and PhIP also resulted in induction of the biochemical endpoints of
    ROS elevation and Ras-Erk-Nox pathway activation in MCF7 cells as they did in
    MCF10A cells.', 'We detected that parental MCF7 cells possessed higher levels
    of ROS, H-Ras protein expression, Erk activation, and Nox-1 protein expression
    than MCF10A cells, and cumulative exposures to NBP were able to furthermore increase
    ROS production and Ras-Erk-Nox pathway induction in MCF7 cells.', 'Exposure to
    NBP resulted in higher levels of ROS production and Ras-Erk-Nox pathway induction
    in MCF7 cells than either NB or PhIP alone, consistent with the higher levels
    of cancer-associated properties acquired by NBP-exposed versus NB- or PhIP-exposed
    MCF7 cells.', 'These results indicated that cumulative exposures to combined NNK,
    BP, and PhIP were able to constitutively induce cellular acquisition of cancer-associated
    properties and associated biochemical endpoints in not only non-cancerous ER-negative
    MCF10A cells, but also cancerous ER-positive MCF7 cells in a similar manner.',
  A combination of multiple carcinogens was more potent than individual carcinogens
    in long-term induction of breast cell carcinogenesis progression in both non-cancerous
    and cancerous cells in an ER-independent manner., 'Thus, co-exposure to low doses
    of NNK, BP, and PhIP should be seriously considered in epidemiological studies
    to reveal the value of these carcinogens in the development of sporadic breast
    cancer.', 'Given their ability to increase cancer-associated properties in non-cancerous
    or cancerous cells alike, it is important to identify agents capable of blocking

    properties.', 'However, whether non-cytotoxic ECG and EGCG are effective in prevention
    of sporadic breast cancer development associated with long-term exposure to NBP
    will need epidemiological and clinical studies for validation.', Our unique model
    presents several advantages over others to advance our understanding of human
    breast carcinogenesis and early intervention., 'It is highly sensitive in detecting
    physiologically-achievable, low doses of either weak or potent carcinogens capable
    of inducing breast cell carcinogenesis.', It takes a unique approach of exposing
    cells to carcinogens in a cumulative manner for progressive induction of chronic
    carcinogenesis from non-cancerous to pre-cancerous and cancerous stages., 'In
    addition, it uses measurable transient and constitutive cellular, biochemical,
    and molecular endpoints to determine the induction and progression of cellular
    carcinogenesis and to identify non-cytotoxic agents effective in intervention.',
  'In this communication, we used our model to demonstrate, for the first time, the
    ability of two relatively weak breast carcinogens, NNK and BP, to enhance breast
    cell carcinogenesis induced by potent breast carcinogen PhIP; we also identified
    the ability of combined ECG and EGCG, which was more effective than individual
    catechins, to intervene in carcinogenesis induced by combined NNK, BP, and PhIP.',
  'We reported that transient induction of ROS, the Ras-Erk-Nox pathway, increased
    cell proliferation, and DNA damage accounted for the mechanisms of initiation
    of cellular carcinogenesis during each exposure to NNK, BP, and/or PhIP , , ultimately
    leading to acquisition of cancer-associated properties and progression of cellular
    carcinogenesis induced by cumulative exposures.', 'These transient endpoints were
    highly enhanced by combined NNK, BP, and PhIP.', 'Blockage of ROS elevation or
    the Ras-Erk-Nox pathway significantly reduced NBP-induced DNA damage and cell
    proliferation, indicating essential roles of ROS elevation and Ras-Erk-Nox pathway
    activation in NBP-induced cellular carcinogenesis.', 'Accordingly, transient induction
    of ROS elevation and the Ras-Erk-Nox pathway served not only as markers for detecting
    NBP effects but also as targets for suppressing NBP-induced carcinogenesis.',
  'As we demonstrated in this communication, we initially used ROS elevation and the
    Ras-Erk-Nox pathway as targets to detect the optimal concentration and combination
    of ECG and EGCG effective in suppression of NBP-induced transient endpoints.',
  'Subsequently, we used cancer-associated properties/constitutive endpoints as targets
    to verify the effectiveness of combined ECG and EGCG in intervention of NBP-induced
    progression of cellular carcinogenesis.', "Previously, we reported the mitogenic
    ability of NNK at 100 pmol/L, BP at 100 pmol/L, and PhIP at 10 nmol/L to induce
    increased cell proliferation in a single exposure and after cumulative exposures
    \u2013.", 'Here, we showed that a combination of these carcinogens at these same
    doses was also mitogenic.', 'In addition, induction of reduced viability or cell
    death by NBP was not detectable, indicating that NBP was not cytotoxic at all.',
  "Thus, like NB- or PhIP-induced carcinogenesis progression \u2013, NBP-induced breast
    cell carcinogenesis did not involve the selection of apoptosis-resistant carcinogenic
    clones; instead, cumulative exposures to NBP resulted in progressive cellular
    acquisition of cancer-associated properties.", 'In addition, our model system
    is able to address whether preventive agents are effective in intervention of
    cancer stem-like cell development.', 'Development of cancer stem-like cells, involving
    induction of the EMT program, has been postulated to play important roles in cancer
    development  and cancer recurrence after chemotherapy .', 'Using our model, we
    demonstrated the ability of NBP to induce increased stem-like cell population
    and the EMT program in ER-negative MCF10A cells.', These results provide evidence
    for the involvement of mesenchymal stem-like properties during the carcinogenic
    transformation of ER-negative breast cells., 'In addition, long-term NBP exposure
    resulted in acquisition of increased cancer-associated properties by not only
    non-cancerous MCF10A but also cancerous MCF7 cells in an ER-independent manner.',
  'Possibly, long-term exposure to NBP may also result in increased mesenchymal stem-like
    properties in other types of breast cancer cells, such as basal-like, triple-negative
    cancer cells.', 'However, whether long-term exposure of triple-negative cancer
    cells to NBP will result in increased carcinogenic potency remains to be clarified.',
  'Using our model, we also demonstrated that combined ECG and EGCG was more effective
    than individual agents in intervention of NBP-increased stem-like cell population
    and EMT program induction.', 'Thus, applying our model will help accelerate our
    understanding of low-dose carcinogens in breast cell carcinogenesis and identification
    of preventive agents effective in reducing the health risk of sporadic breast
    cancer associated with chronic exposure to low doses of environmental and dietary
    carcinogens.', We are grateful to Ms. M. Bailey for textual editing of the manuscript.,
