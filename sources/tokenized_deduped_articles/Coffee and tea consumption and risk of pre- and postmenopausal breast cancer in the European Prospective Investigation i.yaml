[Specific coffee subtypes and tea may impact risk of pre- and post-menopausal breast
    cancer differently., We investigated the association between coffee and tea intake
    and risk of breast cancer., 'A total of 335,060 women participating in the European
    Prospective Investigation into Nutrition and Cancer Study, completed a dietary
    questionnaire from 1992 to 2000, and were followed-up until 2010 for incidence
    of breast cancer.', 'Hazard ratios of breast cancer by country-specific, as well
    as cohort-wide categories of beverage intake were estimated.', 'During an average
    follow-up of 11 years, 1064 premenopausal, and 9134 postmenopausal breast cancers
    were diagnosed.', 'Caffeinated coffee intake was associated with lower risk of
    postmenopausal breast cancer: adjusted HR = 0.90, 95% confidence interval: 0.82
    to 0.98, for high versus low consumption; Ptrend = 0.029.', 'While there was no
    significant effect modification by hormone receptor status, linear trend for lower
    risk of breast cancer with increasing caffeinated coffee intake was clearest for
    estrogen and progesterone receptor negative, postmenopausal breast cancer.', 'For
    every 100 ml increase in caffeinated coffee intake, the risk of ER-PR- breast
    cancer was lower by 4%.', "Non-consumers of decaffeinated coffee had lower risk
    of postmenopausal breast cancer compared to low consumers, without evidence of
    dose\u2013response relationship.", 'Exclusive decaffeinated coffee consumption
    was not related to postmenopausal breast cancer risk, compared to any decaffeinated-low
    caffeinated intake, or to no intake of any coffee.', Caffeinated and decaffeinated
    coffee were not associated with premenopausal breast cancer., Tea intake was neither
    associated with pre- nor post-menopausal breast cancer., Higher caffeinated coffee
    intake may be associated with lower risk of postmenopausal breast cancer., Decaffeinated
    coffee intake does not seem to be associated with breast cancer., 'Coffee and
    tea are the most popular beverages consumed worldwide, rendering them as relevant
    dietary exposures .', 'Coffee and tea consumption may protect against breast cancer
    through anticarcinogenic properties of their biochemical compounds such as caffeine,
    polyphenols and diterpenes - or through favorably altering the levels of hormones
    implicated in breast cancer -.', 'While polyphenols, including flavonoids, may
    mimic estradiol structure and, hence, antagonize estrogen action, paradoxically,
    they may also bind weakly to estrogen receptors and promote estrogen-dependent
    transcription .', 'A major systematic review by the World Cancer Research Fund
    and American Institute for Cancer Research had concluded that for the association
    between coffee and tea intake and pre- and postmenopausal breast cancer, evidence
    did not allow for definite conclusions .', A minority of studies that distinguished
    between types of coffee consumed showed contradictory results for decaffeinated
    coffee ., 'Nevertheless, it is conceivable that different types of coffee are
    associated with opposing effects on cancer risk owing to differences in their
    constituents.', 'For instance, decaffeinated coffee may contain very low levels
    of caffeine .', 'Therefore, it is pertinent to further explore the effects arising
    from differing caffeine levels in caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee.', 'Premenopausal
    and postmenopausal breast cancers have been argued for some time to be diseases
    with somewhat different etiologies ,, and it is conceivable that dietary factors
    may impact the risk of pre- and postmenopausal breast cancer differently .', 'It
    has also been recently hypothesized that breast cancer comprises two fundamental
    etiological components, which are to a certain extent defined by estrogen receptor
    expression by age at diagnosis.', 'Therefore, it has been proposed that in large-scale
    population based studies, etiological analyses for breast cancer should be stratified
    according to molecular subtypes .', 'To date, relatively few studies have differentiated
    between pre- and postmenopausal breast cancers ,, or investigated the association
    between coffee and tea intake with breast cancer based on estrogen receptor and
    progesterone receptor status ,,.', 'The results have been overall inconsistent
    and may be attributed to the fact that most studies were hampered by limited numbers
    of cases ,,.', We determined the association between coffee and tea consumption
    with risk of pre- and postmenopausal breast cancer within the European Prospective
    Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition cohort ., Distinction was also made between
    breast cancers by hormone receptor status., 'The EPIC study is an on-going multi-center
    prospective cohort study aimed at investigating the association between diet,
    lifestyle, genetic and environmental factors and the development of cancer and
    other chronic diseases.', 'It consists of 521,448 men and women, followed-up for
    cancer incidence and cause-specific mortality for several decades.', 'There are
    23 EPIC centers in 10 European countries, that is, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece,
    Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, and United Kingdom.', Details have
    been described elsewhere ., 'At enrollment between 1992 and 2000, information
    on habitual diet in the preceding year was collected through a questionnaire in
    most countries.', 'Lifestyle questionnaires were used for information on education,
    reproductive history, use of oral contraceptives and hormone therapy, family history,
    medical history, physical activity and history of consumption of alcohol and tobacco
    .', This study pertains to female participants of the EPIC cohort between 25-
    and 70-years old at recruitment., 'We excluded participants with prior history
    of cancer, incomplete dietary/non-dietary information, and poorly completed questionnaires
    based on their ratio of energy intake versus energy expenditure, leaving 335,060
    women.', All participants provided written informed consent., "The study was approved
    by the International Agency for Research on Cancer\u2019s ethical review committee
    and by the respective local ethical committees.", 'Diet was assessed using country-specific
    questionnaires , namely self-administered semi-quantitative food-frequency questionnaires,
    dietary history questionnaires administered by interviewers, and semi-quantitative
    food-frequency questionnaires combined with a food record.', Further details on
    questionnaires and their validation are described elsewhere ., 'As the exact structure
    of the questions varied by center and questionnaire, complete information on caffeinated
    and decaffeinated coffee intake was available only in Germany, Greece, Italy,
    the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.', 'Analyses of
    caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee consumption only included women with complete
    information on type of coffee intake, that is, those whose different types of
    coffee intakes added up to their total coffee intake.', 'For caffeinated coffee
    consumption, 226,368 participants were included.', 'Since none of the participants
    in Norway and Sweden consumed decaffeinated coffee, they were excluded from analysis
    for decaffeinated coffee consumption, leaving 176,373 participants.', 'Information
    on tea intake was not available in Norway, leaving 299,890 participants.', 'As
    the cohort consists of multiple populations with a wide range of variation in
    terms of volume and concentration of coffee and tea intake, country specific quartiles
    for these beverages were estimated based on distribution of intake within each
    country, after excluding the non-consumers.', 'This yielded the following intake
    categories for total coffee, caffeinated coffee and tea: none, low, moderately
    low, moderately high, and high.', 'As decaffeinated coffee intake was less common,
    we used tertiles of intake for the consumers and intake categories were: none,
    low, medium, and high.', The outcome of interest was first incident of primary
    invasive breast cancer., 'As data on menopausal status at diagnosis was lacking,
    breast cancers occurring before the median menopausal age of 50 years were considered
    premenopausal, whereas those diagnosed at 50 years or older were considered postmenopausal.',
  Information on hormone receptor status was provided by each center based on pathology
    reports., 'This information was routinely available for tumors diagnosed after
    1997 to 2006, depending on the center.', 'Follow-up was based on linkage with
    population cancer registries in Denmark, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden
    and the United Kingdom.', 'In France, Germany and Greece, combined methods including
    health insurance records, cancer and pathology registries, and active follow-up
    were used.', Censoring dates for most centers depended on the dates at which cancer
    registries were considered complete., 'In Germany, Greece and France where active
    follow-up was undertaken, dates of censoring were up to March 2010, December 2009,
    and July 2005, respectively.', Loss to follow-up was less than 4%., Multivariable
    Cox regression was used to examine the association between coffee or tea consumption
    and risk of breast cancer., 'Time at entry was age at recruitment, and exit time
    was age at diagnosis with breast cancer as first tumor, death, emigration, loss
    to follow-up, or end of follow-up.', The non-zero slope of the scaled Schoenfeld
    residuals on the time function suggested that the proportional hazard assumption
    was met., All analyses were stratified by age at recruitment in one-year categories
    and by centers to control for differences in recruitment or follow-up procedures
    and questionnaire design., We studied consumption of beverages both as categorical
    and continuous variables., 'Non-consumers of coffee comprised a relatively small
    group and seemed to have some unique health behaviors: they were less likely to
    have ever smoked, consume alcohol, or to have ever used oral contraceptives, and
    they were more likely to be physically inactive compared to the rest of the study
    population.', 'We, therefore, used the low coffee consumers as the reference group
    in the categorical data analysis.', 'To test for linear trends, the categories
    were entered as a continuous term in the Cox model.', 'Since most coffee consumers
    tend to consume caffeinated as well as decaffeinated coffee, we additionally cross-classified
    coffee intakes in relation to breast cancer.', 'This yielded eight categories,
    of which decaffeinated coffee consumers with low caffeinated coffee intake comprised
    the largest group and was hence chosen as the reference for reasons of statistical
    robustness.', Two separate Cox models were fitted for pre- and postmenopausal
    breast cancers., 'Both models were adjusted for age at menarche, ever use of oral
    contraceptives, age at first delivery, ever breastfeeding, smoking status, educational
    level, physical activity level based on the Cambridge Physical Activity Index
    , alcohol intake, height, weight, energy intake from fat source, energy intake
    from non-fat source, total saturated fat intake, and total fiber intake.', The
    model for postmenopausal breast cancer was additionally adjusted for ever-use
    of postmenopausal hormones., 'Importantly, coffee and tea intake were mutually
    adjusted for one another while models for caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee
    were also mutually adjusted.', 'As data on hormone receptor status was only available
    in breast cancer cases diagnosed after 1997 to 2006, depending on the center,
    it is mainly the postmenopausal cases that had receptor status available and only
    about half of the premenopausal cases.', 'Hormone-receptor defined analyses were,
    hence, only done among postmenopausal breast cancers and were not possible within
    premenopausal breast cancers.', 'As a form of sensitivity analysis, we also analyzed
    beverage intake using categories based on the overall cohort instead of country
    specific intake.', 'To improve comparability across centers, dietary intake was
    calibrated by a 24-hour dietary recall method common to all centers, in a random
    sub-sample of 8% of the cohort at baseline ,.', Heterogeneity of the association
    according to hormone receptor status was assessed using a data-augmentation method
    described by Lunn and McNeil ., 'Effect modification by body mass index  and country
    were assessed, and several sensitivity analyses were conducted.', Two-tailed P-values
    ;0.05 and 95% confidence intervals for hazard ratios not including 1 were considered
    statistically significant., All analyses were performed using SAS version 9.1.,
  'A great majority of the study participants consumed coffee, with a median total
    coffee intake ranging from 93 ml/day in Italy to 900 ml/day in Denmark.', Decaffeinated
    coffee was consumed by about 50% of the study population., Median decaffeinated
    coffee intake ranged from 2 ml/day in Spain and United Kingdom to 140 ml/day in
    France., Tea was consumed by approximately 66% of the total cohort resulting in
    a median intake ranging from close to 0 ml/day in Greece to up to 475 ml/day in
    United Kingdom., The mean age at recruitment was 51 years with 43% of the participants
    being postmenopausal., 'Based on body mass index classification by the World Health
    Organization, 58% of participants were of normal weight, 29% overweight and 13%
    obese.', 'Compared to the low coffee consumers, those with high coffee consumption
    were more likely to have ever smoked, used oral contraceptives, be physically
    active, and consumed more alcohol but less tea.', 'They were also more likely
    to comprise women attaining early menarche, and those with very young age at first
    childbirth.', 'In contrast, participants with high decaffeinated coffee intake
    were less likely to have used oral contraceptives, and more likely to be postmenopausal,
    and use hormone replacement therapy, compared to the low consumers.', 'They also
    less frequently attained tertiary education, and were more likely to have breastfed
    their offspring.', 'However, compared to non-consumers, consumers of decaffeinated
    coffee were more likely to have attained tertiary education, be physically active,
    be non-smokers, and less likely to be very young at first childbirth.', 'Compared
    to low tea intake, those with high tea intake were more likely to be older at
    recruitment, have higher education status, be more active physically, use more
    oral contraceptives, be older at first delivery, be postmenopausal, and use hormone
    replacement therapy.', Table 1., 'Distribution of risk factors according to levels
    of consumption of coffee and tea


    During an average 11 years of follow-up, 10,198 first incidences of primary invasive
    breast cancer were observed among 335,060 women.', 'Of these, 1,064 were premenopausal
    breast cancers.', 'Hormone receptor status was available in approximately 70%
    of total breast cancer cases, out of which 50% were double hormone receptor positive
    tumors, followed by 33% of single hormone receptor positive tumors, whereas 17%
    were double negative tumors.', 'Tables 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 show the numbers of participants,
    cases, and multivariable adjusted HRs for each category of coffee and tea intake.',
  'For analysis of beverages as continuous value, the observed and calibrated HRs
    were identical.', We only present the observed HR., Table 5., 'Cross-classified
    coffee intake and risk of postmenopausal breast cancera





    While moderately low intake of total coffee consumption seemed to be associated
    with higher risk of premenopausal breast cancer, no dose response relationship
    was observed; Ptrend = 0.272.', 'Overall, intake of total coffee was associated
    with a borderline statistically significantly lower risk of postmenopausal breast
    cancer.', Multivariable HR comparing high total coffee intake to low intake was
    0.95., The linear trend test was not significant; Ptrend = 0.055., Each 100 ml
    increase in daily intake of total coffee was inversely associated with breast
    cancer risk., There seemed to be no association between caffeinated coffee intake
    and premenopausal breast cancer., 'However, higher intakes of caffeinated coffee
    were associated with lower risk of postmenopausal breast cancer.', A linear trend
    for the inverse associations of caffeinated coffee intake with postmenopausal
    breast cancer risk was also apparent in this analysis; Ptrend = 0.029., 'While
    there was no significant effect modification by hormone receptor status, a linear
    trend for lower risk of breast cancer with increasing caffeinated coffee intake
    was clearest for ER- PR- breast cancer.', 'For every 100 ml higher caffeinated
    coffee consumption, the risk of ER- PR- breast cancer was lower by 4%.', The risk
    of ER+ PR+ breast cancer was lowered by 2% per 100 ml., 'However, the P value
    for trend test of categorical analyses was not significant.', No association was
    observed between decaffeinated coffee intake and premenopausal breast cancer.,
  Non-consumers compared to low consumers of decaffeinated coffee did show a significantly
    lower postmenopausal breast cancer risk., 'There was, however, no difference in
    risk of breast cancer between high decaffeinated coffee consumers, compared to
    low consumers.', 'Post-hoc analysis comparing non-consumers of decaffeinated coffee
    against the consumers showed a modest decrease in risk of postmenopausal breast
    cancer; adjusted HR: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.82 to 0.98.', There was no dose response
    relationship., 'Compared to low decaffeinated coffee consumers, it seemed that
    the non-consumers of decaffeinated coffee had a lower risk of developing ER- PR-
    breast cancer, than ER+ PR+ breast cancer.', 'However, test for interaction with
    hormone receptor status was not statistically significant.', 'As compared to decaffeinated
    coffee consumers with low caffeinated coffee intake, non-consumers of decaffeinated
    coffee with higher intakes of caffeinated coffee had significantly lower risk
    of postmenopausal breast cancer.', 'Within consumers of decaffeinated coffee,
    no such association with higher intakes of caffeinated coffee was observed.',
  Exclusive decaffeinated coffee consumption was also not associated with risk of
    postmenopausal breast cancer compared to decaffeinated coffee consumption with
    low caffeinated coffee intake., 'Post-hoc analysis within women who did not consume
    any caffeinated coffee, showed no difference in risk of postmenopausal breast
    cancer between 21,239 non-consumers of decaffeinated coffee and 9,810 decaffeinated
    coffee consumers.', Tea consumption was neither statistically significantly associated
    with risk of premenopausal nor postmenopausal breast cancer., 'The adjusted HR
    for high tea intake versus low intake was 0.98 for premenopausal breast cancer,
    and 0.95 for postmenopausal breast cancer.', Analysis by hormone receptor status
    did not show any significant results., Our sensitivity analyses showed that results
    remain essentially unchanged when analysis of beverage intake was conducted using
    cohort wide categories of intake instead of country specific categories., We did
    not observe any effect modification by BMI., 'There was no statistically significant
    heterogeneity between countries for the association between total coffee, caffeinated
    coffee, decaffeinated coffee, and tea intake and breast cancer.', 'None of the
    associations were substantially altered when family history of breast cancer was
    included in the analyses, or when analysis was restricted to follow-up experience
    after two years of recruitment into the study.', 'In this study, high versus low
    caffeinated coffee intake was associated with a modest but statistically significantly
    lower risk of postmenopausal breast cancer.', This association was only detected
    in women not consuming decaffeinated coffee., 'Although abstinence of decaffeinated
    coffee seemed to be associated with lower risk for postmenopausal breast cancer,
    exclusive decaffeinated coffee intake was not associated with increased risk.',
  Tea intake was not associated with risk of postmenopausal breast cancer., 'Neither
    caffeinated coffee, decaffeinated coffee, nor tea intake impacted the risk of
    premenopausal breast cancer.', 'Our null finding for the association between total
    coffee intake and risk of postmenopausal breast cancer corroborates the findings
    of most previous large-scale prospective studies and meta-analyses ,.', 'The lack
    of association observed in the current study and previous studies seems to support
    the notion that studying total coffee intake as a single entity may result in
    a net null association owing to differences in the direction of association between
    caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee, in relation to breast cancer.', 'Hence,
    we would like to recommend that future studies in populations consuming both types
    of coffee should explicitly analyze caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee intake
    separately.', "The observation that caffeinated coffee was significantly associated
    with lower risk of postmenopausal breast cancer seems to be in agreement with
    the finding of a recent population based case\u2013control study by Lowcock et
    al.", in Canada ., "This study, and another population-based case\u2013control
    study, which included participants from Sweden as well as Germany , had further
    found that caffeinated coffee intake was significantly associated with a reduced
    risk of estrogen receptor negative breast cancers but not estrogen receptor positive
    breast cancers, while we found a stronger association in ER- PR- breast cancers.",
  'A cohort study in Sweden had also found that increased coffee intake was associated
    with lower risk of ER- PR- breast cancer, but at a more modest margin of protection,
    not achieving statistical significance .', 'Other recent prospective cohort studies,
    however, could not show an association between caffeinated coffee intake and risk
    of breast cancer -.', 'While it seems plausible that caffeine plays a role in
    explaining the lower risk of breast cancer associated with caffeinated coffee
    intake in the current study , a number of studies have shown that caffeine intake
    per se does not impact breast cancer risk ,-,.', 'It is hence postulated that
    another compound, or compounds, in caffeinated coffee may confer a protection
    against breast carcinogenesis by acting synergistically with caffeine .', 'This
    explanation seems plausible given that in our study, caffeinated coffee, which
    contains caffeine and a plethora of other compounds, was associated with lower
    risk of postmenopausal breast cancer, whereas decaffeinated coffee does not seem
    to be associated with risk of breast cancer.', 'In this study, those who reported
    not to consume decaffeinated coffee seemed to have a significantly lower risk
    of breast cancer.', "However, we did not observe a dose\u2013response relationship.",
  Cross-classified coffee intake analysis further showed that exclusive decaffeinated
    coffee consumption was not associated with risk of postmenopausal breast cancer
    compared to decaffeinated coffee and low caffeinated coffee consumption., Post-hoc
    analyses also showed that exclusive decaffeinated coffee consumption was not associated
    with increased risk of postmenopausal breast cancer compared to no intake of any
    coffee., 'Taken together, these findings seem to suggest that decaffeinated coffee
    intake is not associated with postmenopausal breast cancer.', 'The apparent decrease
    in risk among non-consumers of decaffeinated coffee may be explained by findings
    of previous studies, which have suggested that decaffeinated coffee consumers
    may be unique in terms of lifestyle or medical history ,.', Decaffeinated coffee
    intake is related to illness in some persons but to a healthy lifestyle in others
    ., 'This is corroborated in the current study, where consumption of decaffeinated
    coffee was associated with a healthier lifestyle compared to non-consumption.',
  'Hence, there may have been minimal overlap in confounders between the consumers
    and non-consumers of decaffeinated coffee to allow optimal adjustment.', It is
    also conceivable that the breast cancer screening behavior of decaffeinated coffee
    consumers may have contributed to higher detection of breast cancers in this subgroup.,
  This may also explain why higher caffeinated coffee intakes within decaffeinated
    coffee consumers were not associated with a lower risk of breast cancer., "It
    is, however, acknowledged that distinguishing genuine decaffeinated coffee effects
    from a \u2018decaffeinated coffee preference\u2019 effect may be difficult.",
  A meta-analysis on the association of tea intake with breast cancer risk had found
    no overall protective effect of black tea ., This corroborates our findings since
    black tea is the predominantly consumed type of tea in Europe ., 'Possibly explaining
    the lack of association between black tea and breast cancer is that it contains
    a relatively lower amount of caffeine compared to coffee, and up to 10-fold reduction
    in catechin levels compared with green tea, which had been inversely associated
    with breast cancer .', 'Besides having a sufficiently large number of premenopausal
    breast cancers, we also had a relatively high number of breast cancer cases whose
    hormone receptor statuses were available to allow analysis by ER and PR status.',
  Our findings further support the view that pooling of pre- and postmenopausal breast
    cancers as a homogenous entity is not recommended., 'We do, however, acknowledge
    that data on menopausal status at diagnosis was not available, and we had to use
    age at breast cancer diagnosis as a proxy.', 'Although coffee and tea intakes
    were measured only at baseline, analyses of participants in the EPIC sub-cohort
    of Umea in Sweden , as well as participants of the Cancer Prevention Study II
    in the United States , with repeated measures taken up to 10 years apart showed
    that coffee habits are stable over a long period.', 'While the amount of coffee
    intake seems to vary substantially across Europe, true variation in coffee intake
    may not be as large as it seems given that there is an inverse relationship between
    the volume and concentration of coffee.', This is reflected in our results whereby
    the hazard ratios using cohort-wide cutpoints are similar to country-specific
    cutpoints., 'We did not have information on the type of tea, and coffee/tea brewing
    methods, which may vary across the countries and alter the contents of potentially
    beneficial compounds in the beverages.', It has been recently highlighted that
    coffee brewing methods maybe be relevant with respect to breast cancer risk.,
  A cohort study in Sweden showed that a decreased risk of breast cancer was observed
    in women drinking boiled coffee but no association was observed with filtered
    coffee consumption ., Country specific categories of consumption were therefore
    used to address this limitation., 'Besides coffee and tea as prominent sources
    of caffeine in this population, hot chocolate, chocolate candy/candy bars, and
    soft drinks are also possible sources .', 'We had information on chocolate candy/candy
    bars intake and soft drinks, but not on hot chocolate intake.', 'As contributions
    of caffeine from these sources are far lower than from coffee and tea, those intakes
    are unlikely to have impacted our study results .', 'Within a very large cohort
    of women, our findings show that higher caffeinated coffee intake is associated
    with a modest lowering in risk of postmenopausal breast cancer.', Decaffeinated
    coffee intake does not seem to be associated with risk of breast cancer., The
    mechanism by which caffeinated coffee impacts breast cancer risk warrants further
    investigation., 'NB, CVG, CSPMU, and PHMP designed the study.', 'NB, PHMP, CSPMU,
