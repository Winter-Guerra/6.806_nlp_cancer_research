["The characterisation of virgin olive oil from Arbequina, Carrasque\xF1a, Corniche,
    Manzanilla Cacere\xF1a, Morisca, Picual, and Verdial de Badajoz varieties according
    to the individual phenolic compounds at different ripening stage was carried out.",
  'In all olive oil varieties studied, secoiridoid derivatives were most abundant,
    followed by phenolic alcohols, flavonoids and phenolic acids.', "The secoiridoid
    derivatives of hydroxytyrosol were the most important complex phenols for Picual
    and Carrasque\xF1a, whereas the tyrosol derivatives were the major ones found
    in Manzanilla Cacere\xF1a, and Verdial de Badajoz.", 'For secoiridoid derivatives
    of hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol, Arbequina was the oil variety showing the lowest
    concentration.', 'Tyrosol, hydroxytyrosol, vanillic acid, p-cumaric acid, luteolin,
    and apigenin levels were greater in early harvested samples in almost all oils
    analysed.', Antioxidant activity measurements were also accomplished for the seven
    varieties in the first ripening stage.]
