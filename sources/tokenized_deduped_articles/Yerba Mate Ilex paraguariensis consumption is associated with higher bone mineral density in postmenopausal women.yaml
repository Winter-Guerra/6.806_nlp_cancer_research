[Yerba Mate tea consumption is higher in Argentina and other South American countries
    than those of coffee or tea., The effects of Yerba Mate on bone health have not
    previously been explored., 'From a program for osteoporosis prevention and treatment,
    postmenopausal women who drank at least 1 L of Yerba Mate tea daily during 4 or
    more years were identified, and matched by age and time since menopause with an
    equal number of women who did not drink Yerba Mate tea.', Their bone mineral density
    was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry at the lumbar spine and femoral
    neck., Yerba Mate drinkers had a 9.7% higher lumbar spine BMD and a 6.2% higher
    femoral neck BMD., 'In multiple regression analysis, Yerba Mate drinking was the
    only factor, other than body mass index, which showed a positive correlation with
    BMD at both the lumbar spine and the femoral neck.', Results suggest a protective
    effect of chronic Yerba Mate consumption on bone.]
