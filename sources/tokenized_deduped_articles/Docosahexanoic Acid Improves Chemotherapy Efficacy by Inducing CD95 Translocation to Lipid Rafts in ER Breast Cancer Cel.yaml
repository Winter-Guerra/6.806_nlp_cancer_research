    a lesser extent EPA, induced the movement and raft clustering of CD95 in the cell

    study, DHA induced cell death at lower concentrations than EPA in all transformed

    drug, dox, in MDA-MB-231 cells.', 'Lastly, we determined that at least a portion
    of the cytotoxic effect of DHA and its beneficial effects on the action of dox
    may be due to the movement of the CD95 and FADD, two key proteins in DISC, into
    the lipid raft portion of the membrane in MDA-MB-231 cells.', 'Long-chain n-3
    PUFA have been shown to reduce the viability of breast cancer cells, both in vitro

    demonstrates the dose-responsive cytotoxic properties of DHA and EPA on transformed
    breast cells, and is the first, to our knowledge, to confirm the lack of effect
    of these PUFA, even at high concentrations, on the growth/metabolism of non-transformed
    breast cells.', This observation has the potential to be of clinical importance
    as most of the current therapies for malignant cells have negative effects on
    healthy cells., 'The concentration of DHA or EPA needed to induce anti-cancer
    effects in vivo is unknown, but our previous work has demonstrated that the concentrations
    selected in the current study for the drug experiments result in a fatty acid
    composition of n-3 and n-6 fatty acids  similar to concentrations reached in mammary
    tumor phospholipids when rodents are fed a high fish oil diet .', A number of
    mechanisms have been proposed to explain the effects of n-3 PUFA on the growth
    and death of breast cancer cells ., Most hypothesized mechanisms involve the fatty
    acids being incorporated into the cell membrane., Previous work by our group  has
    demonstrated that DHA/EPA treatment of human breast cancer cells increases apoptosis
    and alters the composition of lipid rafts ., 'The FAS receptor, also known as
    CD95, is a receptor on the surface of cells that regulates apoptosis in cancer
    cells .', 'Upon activation, CD95 moves to lipid rafts in the plasma membrane .',
  Cancer cells have been demonstrated to under-express CD95  and inducing expression
    is a mechanism by which many anticancer drugs work ., 'Incorporation of n-3 fatty
    acids alters other receptors in breast cancer cells  and DHA has been shown to
    induce caspase-8 activation , which is an early step in the CD95 pathway.', 'Using
    the immunofluorescent overlay of CD95 with cholera toxin subunit B; used to identify
    lipid rafts , our data suggests that the anti-growth effects of DHA, and to a
    much lesser extent EPA, may in part be due to movement of CD95 to the raft.',
  With fluorescent microscopy there was an indication of raft clustering after treatment
    with DHA in the MDA-MB-231 cells but not the MCF-7 which may have contributed
    to the effects on growth., 'Modified clustering of lipid rafts, and an increase
    in their size has been shown in response to DHA, but not EPA, in EL4 cells .',
  "Further studies using the MDA-MB-231 cell line demonstrated that incubation with
    DHA resulted in increased surface expression of CD95 and increased CD95 in the
    membrane rafts; further supporting that DHA may mediate some of its cytotoxic
    effect on highly metastatic ER\u2212 tumor cells via activation of the death receptor
    complex on the cell surface.", A recent nutrigenomic study investigating the effects
    of EPA on breast cancers differing in ER status concluded that the ER status of
    breast cancer cells may play a role in breast cancer cell response to treatments
    with n-3 and n-6 fatty acids ., 'In the present study, the similar rate of cytotoxicity
    after treatment with DHA and EPA between the MDA-MB-231 cells and the MCF-7 cells,
    suggest that ER status may not be the major mechanism by which n-3 PUFA act, at
    least in vitro.', 'SKBr-3 cells over-express Her2, a growth receptor that is part
    of the epidermal growth receptor family.', We have previously demonstrated that
    treatment with a mixture of DHA and EPA reduced the movement of the epidermal
    growth receptor into lipid rafts in MDA-MB-231 cells  suggesting a mechanism by
    which EPA and DHA inhibit the growth of SKBr-3 cells in the current study., This
    may also be the mechanism responsible for the increased cell death we observed
    in response to low concentrations of EPA and Herceptin., It is unclear why higher
    concentrations of EPA do not induce the same effects; further investigation of
    growth receptor expression and localization in response to EPA and Herceptin treatment
    is warranted., 'To our knowledge, this is the first report of CD95 membrane co-localization
    in response to n-3 PUFA in breast cancer cells; but is consistent with what has
    been reported to occur in T-cells from fish oil-fed mice .', 'Conversely, a study
    of migration and metastasis in MDA-MB-231 cells reported that DHA treatment also
    alter the structure of lipid rafts, but described this disruption in a manner
    similar to what occurs after treatment with methyl-beta-cyclodextrin .', 'In the
    current study, we demonstrate that treatment with DHA resulted in the movement
    of a key signaling molecules, CD95, to the membrane in two human breast cancer
    cell lines.', Pre-treatment with either EPA or DHA did not significantly increase
    the cytotoxic effect of Herceptin or dox in SKBr-3 cells and MCF-7., 'However,
    for MDA-MB-231 cells there was a higher toxicity of dox when cells had been pre-treated
    with EPA or DHA, suggesting a potential therapeutic benefit of providing this
    fatty acid prior to treatment with chemotherapy drugs.', Vibet et al., 'also observed
    that treating MCF-7 cells with DHA did not increase the sensitization to dox ,
    which suggests that activity of the drug is not influenced by changes in membrane
    composition in this ER+ cell line.', 'Our study is the first report, to our knowledge,
    examining the potential effect of n-3 fatty acids on the action of Herceptin,
    a mAb that blocks the binding to the Her2 receptor.', 'Pre-treatment with DHA
    and EPA, significantly improved the anti-growth/metabolic effect of dox treatment
    on MDA-MB-231 cells.', This was accompanied by a higher surface expression of
    CD95 and content of CD95 in the lipid raft fraction over DHA or dox treatments
    alone., 'As we were unable to detect changes in total cellular CD95 protein, our
    results suggest that the combination of DHA and dox causes intracellular CD95
    to move into the lipid rafts in the cell membrane.', 'CD95 aggregation is known
    to result in the recruitment of FADD to the CD95 receptor in membrane rafts, forming
    the CD95-DISC, which activates the apoptotic cascade initiated by caspase-8 .',
  'Consistent with the literature , in the present study, dox treatment increases
    FADD content in the rafts.', Our data extends this by demonstrating that pre-treatment
    with DHA increases the amount of FADD that moves into the raft., 'Although identifying
    the mechanism to explain how pre-treatment with DHA increases the co-localization
    of CD95/FADD in the raft, it is logical to predict that this may occur via and
    increase in the DHA content of the rafts.', We have previously reported that providing
    DHA significantly increases the content of DHA in plasma membrane rafts in MDA-MB-231
    cells ., 'Similarly, we have fed DHA to rodents and produced changes in the DHA
    content of the rafts in immune cells that were similar to what would have occurred
    in the tumor cells in the current study.', "JCR:LA-cp rats fed a diet containing
    28 g fish oil/kg diet enriched the lipid raft DHA concentration to approximately
    1.0 \xB1 0.1 % of total fatty acids .", "Treating MDA-MB-231 cells with 40 \u03BCM
    DHA yielded a raft DHA concentration of 2.6 \xB1 0.4 % for total fatty acids.",
  A change in ceramide content in the cells could also contribute to the anti-cancer
    properties of DHA as DHA treatment results in a decreased sphingomyelin content
    and increased ceramide content in rafts from MDA-MB-231 cells ., A change in the
    cellular content of ceramide in tumors increases the content of CD95 and DISC
    in the membrane  and has been demonstrated to induce apoptosis ., 'Additionally,
    dox treatment has been reported to increases ceramide synthesis in tumor cells
    .', 'DHA treatment has also been demonstrated to facilitate the ability of dox
    to induce oxidative stress in tumor cells , supporting another membrane associated
    mechanism for improved sensitization.', 'Our findings are of potential clinical
    relevance as treatment with the anthracycline-based antibiotic, dox, is one of
    the drugs of choice for treatment of highly invasive metabolically active breast
    tumors, which are modeled by the MDA-MB-231 cell line .', There is clinical evidence
    to support our findings., Breast cancer patients with higher concentrations of
    DHA in breast adipose tissue at the time of diagnosis were reported to respond
    more favorably to chemotherapy ., There is also preliminary evidence suggesting
    that treatment/feeding DHA might improve/prevent some of the side effects of several
    chemotherapy drugs., 'In support of this, a phase II study examining effects of
    DHA supplementation on epirubicin efficacy in patients with highly metastatic
    breast cancer found DHA treatment was associated with improved survival .', "In
    summary, our study provides evidence that pre-treatment with DHA prior to treatment
    with a commonly used breast cancer drug, can increase the anti-cancer effects
    of the drug in an ER\u2212, highly invasive human breast tumor.", 'Our data suggests
    that increased membrane raft localization and aggregation of CD95 and formation
    of DISC, an important signal of apoptosis, may be one of the mechanisms to explain
    this increased sensitivity.', Future studies aimed at linking changes in the cell
    mediated by DHA pre-treatment will assist in understanding the potential role
    that DHA supplementation could have as adjuvant treatment for breast cancer.,
