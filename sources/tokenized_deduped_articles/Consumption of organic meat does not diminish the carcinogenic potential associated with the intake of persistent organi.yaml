['Numerous studies have shown an epidemiological link between meat consumption and
    the incidence of cancer, and it has been suggested that this relationship may
    be motivated by the presence of carcinogenic contaminants on it.', 'Among the
    most frequently detected contaminants in meat are several types of persistent
    organic pollutants, and it is well known that many of them are carcinogenic.',
  'On the other hand, an increasing number of consumers choose to feed on what are
    perceived as healthier foods.', 'Thus, the number of consumers of organic food
    is growing.', 'However, environmental contamination by POPs is ubiquitous, and
    it is therefore unlikely that the practices of organic food production are able
    to prevent this contamination.', 'To test this hypothesis, we acquired 76 samples
    of meat of two modes of production and quantified their levels of 33 carcinogenic
    POPs.', 'On this basis, we determined the human meat-related daily dietary exposure
    to these carcinogens using as a model a population with a high consumption of
    meat, such as the Spanish population.', The maximum allowable meat consumption
    for this population and the carcinogenic risk quotients associated with the current
    pattern of consumption were calculated., 'As expected, no sample was completely
    free of carcinogenic contaminants, and the differences between organically and
    conventionally produced meats were minimal.', 'According to these results, the
    current pattern of meat consumption exceeded the maximum limits, which are set
    according to the levels of contaminations, and this is associated with a relevant
    carcinogenic risk.', 'Strikingly, the consumption of organically produced meat
    does not diminish this carcinogenic risk, but on the contrary, it seems to be
    even higher, especially that associated with lamb consumption.', 'Meat Organic

    It is well known that the food is the primary route of exposure to pollutants
    from numerous chemical classes.', 'Among the multitude of different chemical compounds
    that food may contain, persistent organic pollutants are especially worrisome,
    and during the last decades, many POPs have been highlighted as a cause of concern
    and have been the subject of extensive study and international regulation in part
    because of their carcinogenic potential.', 'Since these compounds are highly resistant
    to degradation and are highly distributed in the environment, their presence in
    food is very difficult to avoid.', 'Thus, it has been established that the ingestion
    of food contributes more than 90 % to the total current exposure to these compounds,
    especially those food from animal origin such as fish, dairy products, or meat.',
  'According to the literature, the content of POPs in meat is particularly relevant,
    and several studies have reported high levels of organochlorine pesticides, polychlorinated
    biphenyls, and especially polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which although they
    are not strictly considered as POPs, they are usually included in this group due
    to their high environmental prevalence and lipophilicity.', 'It is known that
    dietary practices may influence exposure to chemical contaminants such as POPs,
    through the food consumption pattern, the forms of cooking or processing the food,
    the production modes, packaging types, etc.. For example, a growing number of
    people choose organic food as a healthier choice, although the study of the profile
    of these consumers has indicated that they are also motivated by concern for environmental
    health, the animal welfare, or by the perception that organic food has a higher
    nutritional value than conventional products.', 'In fact, in the USA, organic
    food production increased by 50 % during the last decade, and in Europe, this
    increase has been even higher.', 'Numerous studies have compared organic and conventional
    food production, both in relation to their nutritional value and in relation to
    its content of chemical residues.', 'With respect to nutrient content, most studies
    indicate that organic food production does not have a higher nutritional value
    than conventional production.', 'However, studies have shown that organically
    produced foods have much less risk of being contaminated by residues of pesticides
    or other chemical pollutants than conventional foods.', 'Organic livestock are
    fed with organically produced feed that is free of pesticides and animal by-products,
    and therefore it is supposed that there should be lower accumulation of chemical
    residues.', "However, practically, there are no studies on the chemical residues\u2019
    content in organic meat, although some authors have studied the presence of residues
    of veterinary drugs, heavy metals, microorganisms, and antibiotic resistance in
    organically and conventionally produced pigs.", 'Therefore, the comparison with
    conventional production meat has also been scarcely studied.', 'The study of chemical
    contamination of meat is relevant because the consumption of meat has been associated
    with the increased incidence of different types of cancer, and different studies
    have linked this increased risk of cancer with the presence of carcinogenic chemical
    substances in meat.', 'Meat consumption in Europe is high, and according to the
    Integrated Risk Information System, a variety of the most common pollutants in
    meat, such as PCBs, hexachlorocyclohexane, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane and
    its metabolites, and some congeners of PAHs, have been classified in group B of
    carcinogenicity.', 'Although cancer slope factors have been calculated for all
    these probable carcinogens and this would allow an estimate of the risk of cancer
    associated with continuous exposure to them through foodstuff, very few studies
    have attempted to estimate the carcinogenic risks that are associated with the
    current pattern of consumption of meat and meat products.', 'To our knowledge
    no study to date has considered studying whether organic meat production could
    be an option to reduce the carcinogenic potential of meat consumption in relation
    to their content of chemical carcinogens, especially POPs.', 'This study was designed
    to test this hypothesis, where the concentrations of 7 PAHs, 18 PCBs, and 8 OCPs
    for which the CSFs have been calculated were determined in samples of meats from
    organic and conventional production.', The samples were acquired in large suppliers
    who serve the entire European territory., 'The main objective of this study was
    to use these data to estimate the carcinogenic risk associated with the current
    level of meat consumption by the European population considering two possible
    scenarios: consumers that choose organic meats and consumers that choose conventional
    meats.', 'The methodology that has been recently used to estimate the carcinogenic
    risk in other food groups, such as fish, was applied, using the data of food consumption
    of the Spanish population.', Two purchases of meat samples of the two modes of
    production were made in the last quarter of 2013 and the first of 2014., 'These
    purchases were made in supermarkets belonging to large European retail chains
    located in the Canary Islands, which have common suppliers, and can therefore
    be considered representative of the products available to consumers throughout
    the continent.', 'A total of 76 samples of meat were acquired, which were distributed
    as follows: 16 samples of lamb, 32 samples of chicken, and 28 samples of beef.',
  The samples were processed immediately after arrival at the laboratory., Each meat
    sample was finely chopped with a knife and milled using a stainless steel food
    processor., "Then, all the samples were frozen at \u221218 \xB0C until analysis.",
  'Dichloromethane, hexane, ethyl acetate, and cyclohexane were purchased from Fisher
    Scientific.', Ultrapure water was produced using a Milli-Q Gradient A10., Diatomaceous
    earth was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich., Bio-Beads SX-3 were purchased from BioRad
    Laboratories., 'Standards of OCPs, PCB congeners, and the internal standards were
    purchased from DrEhrenstorfer, Reference Materials.', "Standards of PAHs were
    purchased from Absolute Standards, Inc.. Stock solutions of each compound at 1
    mg/mL were prepared in cyclohexane and stored at \u221220 \xB0C.", Solutions diluted
    from 0.05 to 100 ng/mL were used for calibration curves., "The analytes selected
    for this study were 8 OCPs); 18 PCB congeners, including marker-PCBs and dioxin-like
    PCBs; and 7 PAHs listed as carcinogens in the Toxics Release Inventory Program
    of the USA and the EPA\u2019s Priority Chemical listanthracene, benzo(a)phenanthrene,
    benzo(a)pyrene, benzo(b)fluoranthene, benzo(k)fluoranthene, dibenzo(a,h)anthracene,
    and indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene).", All the contaminants included in this study are
    completely lipid-soluble and therefore are found in the lipid fraction of tissues.,
  'For this reason, the fat from the meat was firstly extracted.', 'Thus, the samples
    were homogenized in 5 mL of ultrapure water with a disperser.', This homogenate
    was spiked with the ISs mix in acetone to yield a final concentration of 100 ng/mL
    and was mixed with 30 g of diatomaceous earth to absorb any moisture., 'The extraction
    and cleanup method followed the procedures recommended by the European Standard
    for the determination of pesticides and PCBs in fatty foods, which had been previously
    validated in our laboratory for different fatty samples of animal origin.', This
    method achieves acceptable recoveries that ranged between 71.5 and 103.2 %., "Briefly,
    the fat was extracted using a Soxtec\u2122 2055 Auto Fat Extraction apparatus,
    which consisted of an extraction unit, a control unit, and a drive unit.", 'The
    samples were placed into the extraction unit, and 20 mL of dichloromethane was
    added to each of the extraction cups in a closed system, and the cups were heated
    using an electric heating plate.', 'The three-step extraction consisted of boiling,
    rinsing, and solvent recovery.', "The solvent was evaporated in a rotary evaporator
    at 40 \xB0C to prevent analyte losses.", 'Using a precision balance, the fat obtained
    was carefully weighted into a zeroed glass tube to determine the fat content of
    each meat sample.', The weighted fat was dissolved in 2 mL of cyclohexane/ethyl
    acetate and subjected to purification by gel permeation chromatography using cyclohexane/ethyl
    acetate at a constant flow of 2 mL/min as the eluent., 'The first 25-min elution
    volume, which contained the great majority of lipids, was discarded.', "The 25\u201385-min
    elution volume, which contained all the analytes that were co-extracted with the
    fat, was collected.", 'The sample was concentrated using a rotary evaporator,
    and finally, the solvent was evaporated to dryness under a gentle nitrogen stream.',
  'The residue was then reconstituted in 1 mL of cyclohexane, and the sample was transferred
    to a GC vial that was used for the chromatographic analysis.', The amount of pollutants
    per gram of fat was obtained by multiplying by the corresponding correction factor.,
  The amount of contaminants in fresh meat was obtained by correcting for the fat
    percentage of each sample., 'All the compounds, plus ISs, were analyzed by gas
    chromatography-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry as previously described.',
  "Briefly, a 30 m \xD7 0.25 mm i.d., 0.25-\u03BCm film thickness column was used
    as the stationary phase.", Helium was used as the carrier gas at a constant flow
    of 1 mL/min., "The 61-min oven temperature program was as follows: 60 \xB0C held
    for 1 min, ramped to 210 \xB0C at 12 \xB0C/min and then to 320 \xB0C at 8 \xB0C/min
    and held for 6 min.", "The injector temperature was set at 270 \xB0C, and the
    transfer line was heated to 310 \xB0C.", "The injection volume was 1 \u03BCl in
    the splitless mode.", A timed selected reaction monitoring method for the simultaneous
    analysis of all the compounds in a single run was constructed., "The operation
    conditions of the mass spectrometer were as follows: electron impact ionization
    in SRM; emission current, 50 \u03BCA; ionization source temperature, 220 \xB0C;
    electron multiplier voltage, 1500 V; scan width, 0.15; scan time, 0.05 s; and
    peak width, m/z 0.7, and Da.", 'Argon was used as the collision gas at 0.2 Pa.




    All the recoveries were above 71 %, and it was thus considered acceptable to use
    this method for all the pollutants.', All the individual measurements were corrected
    by the recovery efficiency for each analyte., 'All the samples were injected three
    times, and the values used for the calculations were the mean of the three values.',
  'In each batch of samples, three controls were included for every nine vials: a
    reagent blank consisting of a vial containing only cyclohexane, a vial containing
    2 ng/mL of each of the pollutants in cyclohexane, and an internal laboratory quality
    control consisting of melted meat fat spiked with a mixture of all the pesticides,
    and processed using the same method that was used for the samples.', 'The results
    were considered to be acceptable when the quantification of the analytes in the
    QC was within 15 % of the deviation of the theoretical value, which occurred in
    all the injections.', The limit of quantification was set to 0.1 ng/g for all
    the analytes., 'A zero value was assigned to all the compounds below the limit
    of detection, and those compounds below the LOQ were assigned half of the LOQ.',
  'To estimate the daily intake of pollutants through the consumption of a certain
    type of meat, it is necessary to know the concentration of pollutants in that
    meat and multiply that value by the daily average consumption of that meat in
    a given population.', Data on food consumption in Europe are published by the
    European Food Safety Authority from data provided by the Member States of the
    EU., 'However, the data for the whole EU are available by food groups rather than
    for individual foods.', 'Given that Spain is one of the EU countries with the
    highest meat consumption per capita, the values of consumption of individual foods
    by the Spanish population were used in this study, which have been published by
    the Spanish Agency for Consumer Food Safety and Nutrition.', 'While it has been
    established that regular organic food consumers tend to consume less amount of
    meat than non-consumers, in this paper, we have assumed that consumption is identical,
    for comparison purposes.', 'For the risk assessment, two groups were considered:
    adults and children.', "For calculations of this paper, analytical values have
    been considered separately and grouped as follows: the total value of OCP residues
    as the sum of the 8 OCPs and metabolites measured; the total value of DDTs as
    the sum of the measured values of p,p\u2032-DDT, p,p\u2032-DDE, and p,p\u2032-DDD;
    and the total value of HCH residues as the sum of the 4 HCH isomers measured;
    the total value of PCB residues as the sum of the 18 PCB congeners measured; the
    total value of the marker PCB residues as the sum of the 7 congeners considered
    as markers of environmental contamination by PCBs; the total value of dioxin-like
    PCBs considered as the sum of the measurements of the 12 individual congeners;
    and the total content of carcinogenic PAHs as the sum of the values of the 7 US-EPA
    compounds following the EFSA recommendations.", 'Additionally, for the risk estimation,
    we calculated the potential toxicity for the DL-PCBs using the toxic equivalency
    factors as revised by the World Health Organization in 2005, and the potential
    toxicity in terms of benzopyrene toxic equivalents using the TEFs, which are established
    for the carcinogenic PAHs.', "The CFSs of the carcinogens included in this study
    were taken from the EPA\u2019s IRIS and were as follows: 1 per mg of substance/kg
    body weight-day for marker PCBs, 1.1 \xD7 105 per mg/kg-day for dioxin-like PCBs),
    0.34 per mg/kg-day for DDTs, 1.8 per mg/kg-day for HCHs, 1.6 per mg/kg-day for
    hexachlorobencene, and 7.3 per mg/kg-day for PAHs.", 'To estimate whether chemical
    contamination by carcinogens of meat endangers the consumers, we applied the risk
    assessment index, known as the risk quotient, using the methodology that has been
    used for other food groups, such as fish.', "RQ is defined as the ratio between
    the current consumption of meat and the maximum tolerable consumption of these
    products, which is calculated taking into account the concentrations of carcinogens
    in these foods as follows:\n\n$$ C{R}{\\lim } = \\frac{ARL\\cdotp BW}{{\\displaystyle
    {\\sum}{m=1}^X}{C}{\\mathrm{m}}\\cdotp CS{F}{\\mathrm{m}}} $$\n\nwhere CR lim
    is the maximum allowable consumption rate for a particular meat; ARL is the maximum
    acceptable individual lifetime risk level, and a value of 10\u22125 was used in
    this study; BW is the body weight; C m is the median concentration of contaminant
    m in a particular meat as determined in this study; and CSF m is the cancer slope
    factor of a contaminant m with carcinogenic potential.", 'In the case of multiple
    contaminants with the same CSF, their concentrations in a particular type of meat
    were summed.', '$$ \begin{array}{c}\hfill RQ = \frac{R{\mathrm{meat}}}{C{R}{\lim
    }}\ \left(\mathrm{f}\mathrm{o}\mathrm{r}\ \mathrm{a}\ \mathrm{s}\mathrm{ingle}\
    \mathrm{contaminant}\right)\hfill \\\ {}\hfill RQ = {R}{\mathrm{meat}}\cdotp\

    \mathrm{multiple}\ \mathrm{contaminant}\mathrm{s}\right)\hfill \end{array} $$


    Thus, if the value of RQ is equal to or less than 1, there is no carcinogenic
    risk associated with the ingestion of contaminants through the consumption of
    a particular type of meat.', 'Otherwise, the population is considered to be at
    carcinogenic risk when RQ is greater than 1, indicating that the current consumption
    of that foodstuff is greater than its CR lim value.', The PASW Statistics v 19.0
    software package was used to manage the database of the study and to perform the
    statistical analyses., Normality was examined using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.,
  'The POP distributions in the meat samples lacked normality and homoscedasticity;
    therefore, we used non-parametric tests.', "The results are reported as the medians
    and percentiles 25th\u201375th ranges.", Probability levels of less than 0.05
    were considered statistically significant., 'The main objective of this paper
    is to provide an estimate of the level of exposure to carcinogenic POPs through
    consumption of beef, chicken, or lamb, depending on their mode of production.',
  'While the levels of many of these substances have been identified in previous studies
    carried out in different parts of the world, all these works have been performed
    in conventionally produced meat.', 'As far as we know, no work has been done specifically
    on organic meats.', 'Also, as one might expect, the levels of carcinogenic POPs
    in meats published to date are highly variable, which is logical because it is
    very common to find regional variations in contaminant levels.', 'Since the objective
    of this paper is not to compare our results with previous works but to make a
    comparison of exposure depending on the product chosen by consumers, to make a
    realistic estimate, we preferred to directly quantify the contaminants in a representative
    sample of the main types of meat that any European consumer can find in supermarkets
    of the continent, and directly determine over them carcinogenic contaminant levels.',
  'Table 1 presents a summary of the data obtained directly from these samples, expressed
    as median and percentiles 25th and 75th.', "Concentrations of contaminants with
    carcinogenic potential in samples of organic and conventional meat available in
    the European market  \n\n\n\n\nc P value results from the comparison between the
    medians, where:\n\n\n\nAs it would be expected in foods of animal origin, none
    of the samples was free of all the contaminants investigated.", 'Both, meat samples
    from organic production and from conventional production, presented an average
    of 19 residues.', 'In any case, the levels found in all samples were below the
    levels legally established in Europe.', 'The highest levels of contaminants found
    in this study were those of the M-PCBs in lamb, both organically and conventionally
    produced, and those of DDTs, also in organic and conventional lamb.', 'In fact,
    these two sets of pollutants, the M-PCBs and DDTs, were the most abundant in all
    types of meat, as shown in Table 1.', "With regard to the PCB content of meats,
    it is remarkable that these were completely dominated by congeners 118, 138, 153,
    and 180 in all the cases, and thus, the \u2211M-PCBs contributed with 94.3\u201399.8
    % to the \u2211PCBs.", 'In fact, DL-PCBs were the contaminants that reached the
    lowest levels in all meat types, and therefore the toxic equivalent quantity levels
    for dioxin-like PCBs in the meat samples analyzed had low median values.', Two
    facts attracted attention of our results., 'First, the fact that pollution levels
    are quite different between distinct types of meats.', 'Thus, lamb is by far the
    one with the highest levels of all pollutants studied.', 'At the other extreme,
    we find the chicken having the lowest levels in all cases.', The beef meat shows
    intermediate values., 'These differences are probably attributable to the very
    different percentages of fat of each type of meat, because when we compare the
    data expressed as nanograms of carcinogen per gram of fat rather than per gram
    of fresh product, the differences are much smaller.Second, it is interesting to
    note that the differences between the two modes of production, organic and conventional,
    can be considered minimal, generally speaking.', Table 1 shows the values of statistical
    significance found for each of the pollutants and meats., 'As seen above, the
    highest differences were found between organic and conventional beef.', 'However,
    contrary to what one might think, not in all cases the values were lower in meat
    from organic production.', 'Thus, as it can be observed in Table 1, in the case
    of hexachlorobenzene, levels found in samples of organic beef and organic chicken
    were significantly higher than those found in the same meats from conventional
    production.', 'Also noteworthy is the case of HCH isomers since, although not
    statistically significant, a trend is observed that the levels are higher in lamb
    and beef from organic production.', 'However, in relation to these contaminants,
    the trend was reversed in chicken meat.', 'As the differences were not very relevant
    when analyzed by pollutants, we also performed the comparison by grouping them
    by chemical classes: OCPs, PCBs, and PAHs.', The results are shown in Fig., '1.',
  The only significant differences in the level of pollutants according to the mode
    of production were found for OCPs and PAHs., The most striking results were that
    organic lamb meat contained much higher levels of OCPs than conventionally produced
    lamb., 'These higher levels were also found in chicken meat, but the differences
    were much smaller.', 'However, for beef meat, the situation was reverse: conventional
    production beef showed higher levels of OCPs than beef from organic production,
    and the same was obtained for the levels of PAHs.', "Box plots of the levels of
    \u2211OCPs, \u2211PCBs, and \u2211c-PAHs in the three types of meat studied, and
    comparison between the two modes of production of these meats.", 'The line inside

    and third quartiles of the distribution, and the lines extending vertically from
    the boxes indicate the variability outside the upper and lower quartiles




    Dietary exposure calculations are performed by combining data on consumption habits
    with the concentrations of contaminants found in food samples.', 'The estimation
    of food consumption, nutrient intake, and contaminant exposure is a topic of growing
    interest in the field of public health as a means to inform and guide the actions
    on food security and nutrition, and as a predictive method for determining the
    state of health of populations.', 'For this reason, the European Food Safety Authority
    performs a collection of food consumption data from the different Member States,
    which must develop nutritional surveys in their territories.', 'On this basis,
    the Authority prepares an European database of Food Consumption.', 'For the estimates
    in this paper, the data provided by the authorities on food security of our country,
    Spain, were used.', 'The reason for this is that Spain overall meat consumption
    has steadily increased over the last few decades, and currently, the meat industry
    is ranked in fifth position in the industrial sector of the Spanish economy and
    is ranked first among the agro-food industries.', 'Thus, meat consumption in Spain
    increased from one of the lowest ones in the EU reaching an average per capita
    consumption of 52.7 kg/year/person, which is even higher than the European average.',
  'In any case, using food consumption data from any EU country, and the concentrations
    of pollutants reported in this paper, daily intake levels of these pollutants
    for the different European populations can be easily obtained.', 'It should be
    noted that in our estimates, we have assumed that all consumers equally fit the
    pattern of consumption defined in nutrition surveys.', 'This assumption has been
    made for comparison purposes, although it has been recently described that those
    strict consumers of organic products tend to consume up to 30 % less meat than
    consumers of conventional products, and therefore their actual exposure would
    be lower than the estimates presented here.', 'Table 2 summarizes the dietary
    intake of all the contaminants included in this study arranged by groups, for
    children and adults.', "Median values of dietary intakes of carcinogenic POPs
    by means of the consumption of organic and conventional meats for Spanish adults
    and children  \n\n\n\nFirst, with regards to the OCPs, our results show that the
    estimated daily intake of \u2211DDTs through the consumption of these three types
    of meat for adults living in Spain is 55.71 ng/kg body weight/day if they choose
    to consume conventional products, and 86.75 ng/kg b.w./day if they choose to consume
    organic meats, mainly due to the contribution of lamb meat in both cases.", "In
    children, the exposure to \u2211DDTs through meat consumption is even higher,
    being 91.02 ng/kg b.w./day for consumers of conventionally produced meat, and
    up to 119.86 ng/kg b.w./day for consumers of organic meats.", 'In any case, it
    should be noted that these consumptions represent only between 0.5 and 1.2 % of
    the provisional tolerable daily intake for humans established by the World Health
    Organization for these contaminants(JECFA 2000).', "With regard to the exposure
    to \u2211HCHs through meat consumption, the EDIs were much higher in adults and
    children consuming organic products than in consumers of conventionally produced
    meats.", "However, it is remarkable that, again, in this case, the exposure to
    \u2211HCHs is also far from the established TDIs, representing less than 1 % of
    this value even in the worst scenario.", "The main contributors of this exposure
    to \u2211HCHs were organic lamb and organic beef.", 'Finally, within the group
    of OCPs, with regard to the intake of HCB, we found that once again the major
    contributor was by far lamb meat.', 'However, in this case, organically and conventionally
    produced lamb contributed almost equally to the exposure to this contaminant.',
  'Thus, the HCB EDIs for adults and children who consume organic meat were 56.49
    and 76.57 ng/kg b.w./day, respectively, and were 54.49 and 68.62 ng/kg b.w./day
    for those adults and children consuming conventionally produced meats.', 'In the
    case of this contaminant, these EDIs represent between 6.8 and 9.57 % of the TDI
    set by WHO for HCB.', 'With regard to the group of M-PCBs, the exposure through
    meat consumption was very similar between consumers of organic and conventional
    meats, as seen in Table 2.', The main dietary intake of these contaminants is
    from beef., 'Thus, adult population would be exposed to 37.19 ng/kg b.w./day if
    they consume conventionally produced meat, and to 35.71 ng/kg b.w./day if they
    consume organic meats.', 'In children, the PCB EDIs are almost double than in
    adults.', 'As, for the total PCBs, a TDI value has not been established, it is
    necessary to consider the intake of the most toxic compounds, the DL-PCBs, expressed
    in terms of the equivalency to dioxin toxicity, to assess the level and exposure.',
  "Using this approach, our estimates of \u2211TEQDL-PCBs would represent 3.5 to 16
    % of the TDI of 2 pg/kg b.w./day.", 'In this case, the highest levels of exposure
    were found for children who consume conventionally produced meats.', Our results
    are in accordance to other studies where authors have estimated that meat is an
    important source of dioxins and dioxin-like compounds in a high percentage of
    the samples analyzed., 'These results are worrisome because the possibility exists
    that certain consumers may be subject to high dietary exposures to dioxins, even
    though they choose to consume organic food.', 'Finally, with regard to the last
    chemical group studied, the c-PAHs, we found that conventionally produced beef
    meat was the major contributor.', 'As shown in Table 2, the EDIs for the adult
    population is 1.6 ng/kg b.w./day if they consume conventionally produced meat,
    and a little bit lower if they choose to consume organic meats.', 'In children,
    the EDIs are 3.03 and 1.85 ng/kg b.w./day for consumers of conventional and organic
    meats, respectively.', 'To date, the WHO has not yet established TDI values for
    c-PAHs or benzopyrene.', 'However, other references may be used.', 'Thus, using
    the Contaminated Land Exposure Assessment model of the UK, which has established
    a TDI for BPeq of 20 ng/kg b.w./day, the current meat consumption in Spain would
    represent up to 15 % of these values.', 'As shown in the previous section, in
    all cases, the intake of contaminants through the consumption of meat represents
    a relatively discrete percentage of the TDI established for each of them.', 'However,
    the main objective of our research is focused on the study of the carcinogenic
    potential associated with the consumption of carcinogenic POPs with meat.', 'It
    has been established that the RQ evaluation is a good method to estimate the risk
    of a population, and to establish exposure limits to chemicals.', 'However, the
    application of this method to multiple chemical contaminants present in food has
    some weaknesses because assumptions must be made.', 'Thus, it is well known that
    chemicals in foods are usually present in mixtures of various compounds belonging
    to different chemical classes, and thus they may exert their adverse effects on
    consumers interacting with each other in synergistic, additive, or even in antagonistic
    manners.', 'However, the calculation model of the RQ implies the assumption that
    all pollutants cause similar toxicological effects and that the combined effect
    is the sum of the individual effects.', 'Nevertheless, as recommended by the USEPA,
    we have considered that all carcinogens studied are similar and, therefore, we
    have used the additive model for calculating the RQs.', 'To do this, the CR lim
    values were used for both adults and children.', 'According to these results,
    the current pattern of consumption of meat in the Spanish population implies that
    some of these limits are exceeded.', "Thus, the CR lim of \u2211M-PCBs is exceeded
    by the consumption of all three types of meat, either organic or conventional,
    both in adults and especially in children.", "The CR lim of HCB and \u2211DDTs
    are also exceeded by lamb consumption in both age groups, regardless the type
    of meat production and consumers\u2019 choice.", "Finally, current consumption
    of conventionally produced beef also implies that the CR lim values of \u2211DDTs
    and BPeq are overpassed in children.", "Values of maximum allowable consumption
    rate of conventional or organic meat, expressed in g/day  \n\n\nThe current values
    of consumption of these products by the Spanish population are included for reference\n\nAccording
    to the CR lim, we calculated RQs associated with the current consumption of each
    meat type for both adults and children.", 'From our results, two facts powerfully
    attract the attention.', 'First, the current pattern of consumption of meat implies
    a carcinogenic risk in all cases.', 'The calculated carcinogenic risk ranges between
    1.76 and 17.41 in adults, and between 3.45 and 17.65 in children.', 'On the other
    hand, it is striking that the POP-associated carcinogenic risk tends to be higher
    in organic meats that in those which are conventionally produced.', 'This is especially
    relevant in lamb meat, where the consumption of organic product implies a carcinogenic
    risk up to 1.5 times higher than the consumption of the conventionally produced
    option, both in adults and children.', Risk quotients of the contaminants for
    carcinogenic effects in adults and children via consumption of conventionally
    or organically produced meats., 'The discontinuous horizontal line indicates the
    threshold for carcinogenic risk




    In this research, the concentrations of 33 persistent organic pollutants with
    carcinogenic potential were determined in a large sample of meats available in
    the European supermarkets from two modes of production: conventional and organic.',
  'A mean of 19 of these 33 contaminants in all the samples tested were found, but
    in no case the established MRLs were exceeded.', 'Some significant differences
    in the levels of pollutants between organically and conventionally produced meats
    were found, but these differences can be considered of minor entity.', 'As it
    is well known that continued exposure to carcinogens is not without risk, the
    daily intake of these contaminants from the meat were estimated, taking a high
    meat consumer population such as the Spanish population as a model.', 'According
    to these estimates, exposure is similar in children than in adults, and also very
    similar if these consumers choose conventional or organic meats, generally speaking.',
  'The approximation of the risk ratio was used to evaluate the carcinogenic risk
    of the current pattern of consumption of these meats in the studied population,
    and a relevant risk was found in all the cases.', 'Surprisingly, the risk seems
    to be even higher if the consumer chooses to consume organic meats.', This work
    demonstrates once again that environmental contamination by POPs is ubiquitous
    and human exposure is very difficult to avoid., 'Even those consumers who choose
    to consume organic food, which is theoretically healthier, have exposure rates
    to these legacy pollutants that can become even higher than those of consumers
    who eat conventional food.', This shows that efforts to minimize the environmental
    presence of these toxic pollutants should be continued and even strengthened.,
