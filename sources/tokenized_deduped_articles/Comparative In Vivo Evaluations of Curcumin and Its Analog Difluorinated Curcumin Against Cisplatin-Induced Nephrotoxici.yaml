    of microRNA-21, PTEN and up-regulation of miR-200 .', "In a colon cancer stem-like
    cell model with functional p53, CDF-induced apoptosis was associated with down-regulation
    of the membrane transporter ABCG2 and attenuation of EGFR, IGF-1R, and NF-\u03BAB

    injury markers and oxidative stress markers; restoring renal ion transport markers;

    and reversing the mTOR pathway.", Our comprehensive animal studies provide solid
    evidence in support of the use of CDF in combination therapy to reduce cisplatin
    associated toxicity and warrants further clinical evaluation., Cisplatin is one
    of the most widely used chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of solid and
    liquid tumors ., 'The wide range of cancers where cisplatin has been applied include
    testicular, ovarian, bladder, head and neck, esophagus, stomach and lung cancers,
    as well as lymphoma and osteosarcoma.', 'Unfortunately, it is not specific, and
    as a DNA intercalating agent, shows considerable dose limiting toxicities .',
  'Patients undergoing cisplatin therapy frequently suffer from severe toxicities
    such as nausea, vomiting, renal insufficiency, electrolyte abnormalities, myelosuppression,
    ototoxicity, peripheral neuropathy, hepatotoxicity and retinopathy affecting the
    gastrointestinal, renal, neurological and hematological systems even when administered
    at standard doses .', 'To date, no published guidelines exist for managing a cisplatin
    overdose and there is no known antidote for this very toxic drug.', 'As presented
    in this article, the use of non-toxic agents such as CDF to overcome the toxicities
    of cisplatin could become a highly relevant strategy to reduce patient suffering.',
  'In the past, a number of natural agents have been investigated for their cytoprotective
    effects with the goal to reduce chemotherapy associated toxicities.', 'In particular,
    the anticlastogenic, anti-neoplastic, radioprotective and chemoprotective effects
    of curcumin have been well described .', 'For example, Antunes et al.', demonstrated
    that curcumin and selenium can suppress the cytotoxic effect of cisplatin-induced
    nephrotoxicity and lipid peroxidation in rats., The same group also demonstrated
    that curcumin can ameliorate cisplatin-induced clastogenesis in Wistar rat bone
    marrow cells ., Kuhad et al., earlier reported the protective effect of curcumin
    against cisplatin-induced inflammation and nephrotoxicity., In another study the
    protective effect of curcumin in cisplatin-induced oxidative injury of rat testis
    through suppression of mitogen-activated protein kinase and nuclear factor-kappa
    B signaling pathways was demonstrated ., "Additionally, Mendon\xE7a et al.", have
    shown that curcumin acts as a DNA protective agent against cisplatin-induced DNA
    damage in in vitro cell culture system., The above in vitro and in vivo supporting
    evidence certainly points to beneficial effects of curcumin in preventing different
    forms of cisplatin-induced toxicity., 'However, like many other natural agents,
    curcumin possess very poor bioavailability and this has served as a major hurdle
    for its clinical application .', 'Therefore, newer analogs that have superior
    bioavailability, yet retain the pleiotropic properties of curcumin are urgently
    needed.', 'Making significant progress in the development of improved analogs
    of curcumin, our laboratory recently synthesized CDF that shows nanomolar potency,
    longer half-life and better tissue distribution .', 'Cisplatin is well known to
    cause renal injury those results in activation of serum N-urea, creatinine as
    well as activation of oxidative stress markers such as MDA and 8-isoprostane.',
  "Additionally, enhancement in the DNA binding activity of NF-\u03BAB and the consequent
    activation of tumor promoting factors such as COX-2 have been implicated in cisplatin-induced
    toxicity .", "Furthermore, over-expression of NF-\u03BAB has been implicated in
    the induction of pro-inflammatory proteins such as Nrf2 and HO-1 .", "To this
    end our results show that oral administration of CDF could suppress renal injury
    markers, suppress pro-inflammatory markers and the protein expression of not only
    the master regulators NF-\u03BAB p65 and COX-2 but most importantly, the effector
    proteins Nrf2 and HO-1 as well.", These studies clearly build the case for its
    use in combination with cisplatin based regimens., 'Similarly, several studies
    attributed the protective effect of curcumin in the kidney to the induction of
    the master regulator of antioxidant response Nrf2, inhibition of mitochondrial
    dysfunction, attenuation of inflammatory response, preservation of antioxidant
    enzymes and prevention of oxidative stress .', The kidney is the most critical
    organ that maintains proper physiological ionic environment., It is the first
    organ to respond to disturbances in the ionic milieu in response to adverse hits
    by chemicals and drugs ., 'The kidney specializes in removing toxins, drugs, and
    other organic anions from the blood to extracellular space across the tubular
    epithelium into the lumen of nephrons by a process called "renal secretion" .',
  This is performed by a set of specialized proteins or transporters that reside at
    the basolateral and apical membranes that can transport various organic solutes.,
  'The major, known renal secretory transport systems belong to two distinct groups:
    the organic anion transporter  and organic cation transporter .', The levels of
    OATs as well as OCTs have been consistently shown to be suppressed in patients
    undergoing cisplatin therapy and serve as markers of renal toxicity ., 'Therefore,
    strategies that restore the expression of OATs are being considered in the clinic
    to overcome cisplatin related toxicities.', 'Earlier, curcumin was shown to restore
    OATs and OCTs expression  and our presented findings on curcumin were in line
    with these published reports.', 'However, of paramount significance is the observation
    that CDF showed much superior restoring capacity than curcumin in all the four
    transporters tested.', These findings clearly imply that our analog has greater
    potential in reversing the adverse effects of cisplatin than parent curcumin.,
  Multidrug resistance-associated proteins have been well established for their role
    in conferring resistance to different drugs and natural agents  MRPs have been
    classified into many subtypes., 'MRP2, also called canalicular multi-specific
    organic anion transporter 1, is a protein that in humans is encoded by the ABCC2
    gene .', The other human organic anion transporter MRP4 is an efflux pump for
    the purine end metabolite urate is the other major MRP that has been recognized
    to export NSAIDs and nucleoside analog drugs ., 'In earlier studies, Wortelboer
    et al.,  have shown that curcumin can suppress the expression of MRPs.', 'We focused
    on MRP2 and MRP4 and similar to earlier findings, curcumin could reduce their
    expression.', More intriguing is the observation that CDF has much more enhanced
    inhibitory effects on these two MDR proteins., The role of mTOR pathway in maintenance
    of tumors is well described ., 'Specifically, increased downstream phosphorylations
    of downstream effectors of mTOR, i.e., p70S6K and 4E-BP1 and Akt, have been reported
    in solid tumors .', 'To this end, curcumin was shown to decrease the total expression
    of mTOR and downstream .', 'Nevertheless, very few studies have shown the in vivo
    effects of curcumin on the mTOR pathway, and none have been shown with curcumin
    analogs.', 'Similar to existing cell line findings both curcumin and CDF could
    also ameliorate the cisplatin-induced p-mTPOR, p70S6K and p-Akt expression of
    rat kidneys.', 'However, CDF showed far superior efficacy in reducing the expression
    of phosphorylated proteins.', 'In conclusion, we for the first time showed that
    curcumin analog CDF with higher potency and clinically relevant pharmacokinetic
    parameters prevents cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity by modulating organic anion
    export markers, drug resistance markers and through suppression of mTOR effector
    pathways.', These pre-clinical findings pave the way for future clinical trials
    involving CDF to suppress the adverse effects of cisplatin and other platinum
    based chemotherapies., The authors thank the Veterinary Control and Research Institute
