[Medroxyprogesterone acetate is a synthetic progestin commonly administered to postmenopausal
    women for hormone replacement therapy and has been associated with increased risk
    of breast cancer., 'MPA has been shown to accelerate the development of mammary
    tumors in a 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene-induced breast cancer animal model.',
  'Previously, we have shown that intraperitoneally administered apigenin effectively
    treated and prevented the progression of MPA-accelerated breast cancer in DMBA-induced
    and xenograft mammary cancer models.', Here we used the DMBA model to examine
    the chemopreventive effect of dietary apigenin against MPA-accelerated tumors
    with 3 different levels of apigenin incorporated into a phytoestrogen-free diet.,
  'Results showed that 0.1% dietary apigenin reduced MPA-dependent tumor incidence;
    however, the same dietary level increased tumor multiplicity in animals that developed
    tumors.', 'Neither 0.02% nor 0.5% dietary apigenin reduced MPA-dependent tumor
    incidence or latency, and tumor multiplicity increased significantly in response
    to 0.5% apigenin.', 'These results contrast with previous chemopreventive effects
    observed when apigenin was administered intraperitoneally, suggesting that route
    of administration may influence its action.', 'Consequently, until further research
    clarifies the effect of dietary apigenin on progestin-accelerated mammary tumors,
    caution should be exercised when considering the flavonoid as a dietary supplement
    for preventing hormone-dependent breast cancer.']
