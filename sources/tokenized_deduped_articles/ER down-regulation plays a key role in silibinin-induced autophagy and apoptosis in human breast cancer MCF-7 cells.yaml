[The estrogen receptor alpha has been proven to be one of the most important therapeutic
    targets in breast cancer over the last 30 years., 'Previous studies pointed out
    that a natural flavonoid, silibinin, induced apoptosis in human breast cancer
    MCF-7 cells.', "In the present study we report that exposure of MCF-7 cells to
    silibinin led to cell death through the down-regulation of ER\xCE\xB1 expression.",
  "Silibinin-induced apoptosis of MCF-7 cells through up-regulation of caspase 6 due
    to ER\xCE\xB1 signalling repression was further boosted by ER\xCE\xB1 antagonist.",
  "Moreover, up-regulation of autophagy induced by silibinin accounted for apoptotic
    exacerbation, being further enhanced by ER\xCE\xB1 inhibition.", "Upon ER\xCE\xB1
    activation, series of downstream signalling pathways can be activated.", 'We found
    that silibinin reduced the expressions of Akt/mTOR and extracellular-signal-related
    kinase, which respectively accounted for the induction of autophagy and apoptosis.',
  "These effects were further augmented by co-treatment with ER\xCE\xB1 inhibitor.",
  "We conclude that the treatment with silibinin of ER\xCE\xB1-positive MCF-7 cells
    down-regulates the expression of ER\xCE\xB1, and subsequently mTOR and ERK signaling
    pathways, ER\xCE\xB1 downstream, finally resulting in induction of autophagy and
    apoptosis."]
