[Indole-3-carbinol and indole carbazole are major bioactive food components in cruciferous
    vegetables., 'Although previous studies have demonstrated the anticancer activity
    of I3C and ICZ in various types of cancer cells, the manner in which indole compounds
    regulate migration or related epithelial-to-mesenchymal transitions has yet to
    be determined.', 'In this study, we investigated the effects of I3C and ICZ on
    migration using breast cancer cells.', "Pre\u2011treatment with I3C and ICZ significantly
    inhibited the migration of breast cancer cells without cytotoxicity, as measured
    by monolayer scratch assay.", 'In addition, I3C and ICZ decreased vimentin and
    focal adhesion kinase mRNA expression, while increasing E-cadherin expression.',
  Matrix metalloproteinase-2 and -9 activity was also reduced by I3C and ICZ., "Taken
    together, we propose that I3C and ICZ pre\u2011treatment inhibits the migration
    of breast cancer cells through suppression of the EMT process and reduced MMP
    activity by repressing FAK expression.", Our findings suggested that I3C and ICZ
    are potential compounds for inhibition of breast cancer cell migration.]
