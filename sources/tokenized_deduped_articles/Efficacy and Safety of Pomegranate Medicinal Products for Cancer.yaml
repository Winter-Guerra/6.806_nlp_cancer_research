[Preclinical in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate potent effects of pomegranate
    preparations in cancer cell lines and animal models with chemically induced cancers.,
  We have carried out one systematic review of the effectiveness of pomegranate products
    in the treatment of cancer and another on their safety., The PubMed search provided
    162 references for pomegranate and cancer and 122 references for pomegranate and
    safety/toxicity., 'We identified 4 clinical studies investigating 3 pomegranate
    products, of which one was inappropriate because of the low polyphenol content.',
  The evidence of clinical effectiveness was poor because the quality of the studies
    was poor., 'Although there is no concern over safety with the doses used in the
    clinical studies, pomegranate preparations may be harmful by inducing synthetic
    drug metabolism through activation of liver enzymes.', 'We have analysed various
    pomegranate products for their content of anthocyanins, punicalagin, and ellagic
    acid in order to compare them with the benchmark doses from published data.',
  'If the amount of coactive constituents is not declared, patients risk not benefiting
    from the putative pomegranate effects.', 'Moreover, pomegranate end products are
    affected by many determinants.', Their declaration should be incorporated into
    the regulatory guidance and controlled before pomegranate products enter the market.,
  Pomegranate products are amongst most promising antitumorigenic dietary supplements.,
  The polyphenol fraction of pomegranate exerts antiproliferative and proapoptotic
    effects in a number of cancer cell lines ., "Various mediators of carcinogenesis
    are inhibited by the pomegranate active principle in vitro, for example, vascular
    endothelial growth factor , insulin-like growth factors , cytokine-stimulated
    NF-\u03BAB , and others .", Fermentation is a new technology that enriches coactive
    compounds ., Fermentation of pomegranate juice with Lactobacillus plantarum increased
    the concentration of ellagic acid and enhanced the antimicrobial activity of the
    juice., Both fresh and fermented juices inhibited the growth of K562 tumor cells
    ., Polyphenols from fermented pomegranate juice showed about twice the antiproliferative
    effect shown by polyphenols from fresh pomegranate juice., 'They also inhibited
    the activity of aromatase and 17--hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 by 60-80%
    and inhibited chemically induced formation of cancerous lesions in a murine mammary
    gland organ culture by about 50%  However, a specific purified polyphenol compound
    and pomegranate seed oil were more effective than fermented juice in this in vitro
    test .', 'The isolated ellagitannins, punicalagin, and ellagic acid also had a
    high antiproliferative activity against various cancer cell lines .', 'The aromatase
    enzyme, which converts androgen to estrogen, plays a key role in breast cancer.',
  'Tamoxifen is the usual antiestrogen therapy for hormone-receptor-positive breast
    cancer in premenopausal women, though it carries a risk of development of resistance
    .', 'Pomegranate fruit extracts enhanced the action of tamoxifen in both tamoxifen-sensitive
    and tamoxifenresistant breast cancer cells, through the inhibition of cell viability
    by inducing the cell-death machinery .', 'The polyphenols also inhibited the expression
    of genes for key androgen-synthesizing enzymes and androgen receptors, suggesting
    that the pomegranate polyphenols affect androgen-independent prostate cancer cells
    and the subset of human prostate cancer cells where the androgen receptor is upregulated
    .', 'In investigations of the anti-invasive effects of ellagic acid in androgen-independent
    human and rat prostate cancer cell lines in vitro, ellagic acid significantly
    inhibited the motility and invasion of cells examined in migration and invasion
    assays.', 'The secretion of matrix metalloproteinases from androgen-independent
    human and rat prostate cancer cell lines and the proteolytic activity of collagenase/gelatinase
    were significantly reduced, indicating that the anti-invasive potential of prostate
    cancer cells is mediated via protease activity .', 'Although all pomegranate-derived
    materials contribute to a greater or lesser extent to the anticancer effect of
    pomegranate, the polyphenol fraction and supercritical CO2-extracted seed oil
    were more potent than cold-pressed pomegranate seed oil in inhibiting growth of
    prostate cancer xenografts in athymic mice .', Pomegranate juice was more effective
    than compounds isolated from the juice ., 'In immunodeficient mice, pomegranate
    juice and extract inhibited tumor-associated angiogenesis and slowed the growth
    of prostate cancer .', 'Oral infusion of pomegranate fruit extract resulted not
    only in a dose-dependent inhibition of tumor growth, but also in a decrease of
    prostate-specific antigen levels in mice implanted with androgen-responsive cancer
    cells .', 'Tumor reductions were also seen in mice with induced lung, colon, and
    skin cancers .', 'Of the polyphenols, the chemopreventive pomegranate ellagitannins
    are metabolized during absorption.', 'One of the metabolites, ellagic acid, is
    further metabolized by the colonic microflora to urolithin A.', 'Both ellagic
    acid and urolithin A contribute to the mechanism of anticancer action, but urolithin
    was less effective in inhibiting cancer cell proliferation .', 'There was no difference
    in metabolite production between pomegranate juice and extracts thereof , though
    inactive ellagitannin-derived metabolites are also produced by the colonic microflora
    .', This may account for individual differences in the response to pomegranate
    consumption., The aim of this study was to summarize data on the clinical effectiveness
    and safety of pomegranate preparations for the treatment of cancer and to analyse
    various pomegranate preparations for their content of coactive compounds in order
    to find out the dose required for an anticancer effect in patients suffering from
    prostate cancer., 'On June 20, 2014 we searched PubMed using the terms: "pomegranate
    cancer" and "pomegranate prostate" and, on June 29, "pomegranate safety" and "pomegranate
    toxicity," the reference lists of articles were searched by hand for other publications.',
  No methodological filter was applied and the search was not limited by language.,
  The full manuscript was retrieved for each record that had a chance of meeting the
    review criteria., Two authors extracted the data independently and evaluated the
    quality of the studies and the strength of the evidence of clinical effectiveness
    using the same criteria as in previous reviews ., 'Briefly, the assessment of
    quality was based on "yes" or "no" answers to the following questions: was or
    were(i)patients included on the basis of specified eligibility criteria;(ii)randomization
    appropriate;(iii)treatment allocation concealed;(iv)baseline values of the groups

    during the study;(xii)point estimates and measures of variability presented for
    the primary outcome measure;(xiii)studies undertaken over an appropriate time-course
    to demonstrate the putative effect.', 'For observational studies, some of the
    questions are not applicable but the inability to supply a "yes" answer itself
    marks an "absence of quality" in systematic reviews of this sort.', Potential
    disagreements were discussed and resolved by referring to the original protocol.,
  Adding up the "yes" answers applicable to each study gave it a total score out of
    a maximum of 13., 'Evidence of effectiveness was defined as "strong": pooling
    of data from at least 2 confirmatory studies demonstrating a clinically relevant
    effect;


    (ii) "moderate": consistent findings from one confirmatory study with a clinically
    relevant effect, multiple exploratory studies of high internal validity, or both;


    (iii) poor: multiple exploratory studies of low internal validity or one single
    study of high internal validity.', 'The pomegranate preparations we investigated
    included(A)three commercially available pure juices:(i)5174-13, expiry date June

    analysed by RP-UHPLC-UV using authentic reference compounds., Anthocyanidins were
    analysed by RP-UHPLC-Vis using cyanidin-3-O-glycoside as reference., Total polyphenols
    were determined by the Folin-Ciocalteu photometric method using gallic acid as
    reference., 'Details of the methods are presented at http://www.uniklinik-freiburg.de/rechtsmedizin/forschung/phytomedizin.html.',
  'We identified 162 references for "pomegranate cancer" and 65 references for "pomegranate
    prostate," both included 4 clinical studies investigating pomegranate products
    in prostate cancer patients.', The quality of the studies is listed in Table 1.,
  'According to the criteria set out above in the methods, the evidence of effectiveness
    of pomegranate products for the treatment of prostate cancer is poor.', 'Table
    1: Quality criteria considered in the 4 trials investigating pomegranate products.',
  'We identified 42 references for "pomegranate safety" and 57 for "pomegranate toxicity,"
    respectively.', A total of 26 experimental and 5 clinical studies were included
    in the part on safety together with 17 experimental studies and 15 clinical studies
    from hand searches., 'Table 2 summarizes the total polyphenol content by photometric
    assessment as declared by the manufacturers, along with our own Folin-Ciocalteu
    data.', The HPLC chromatograms are placed on the above-mentioned webpage., The
    table also summarizes coactive compounds as assessed by HPLC and their sum in
    mg/L or mg/kg and the daily dose of polyphenols in the doses of product recommended
    by the manufacturers., 'It can be seen that the sum of our HPLC measurements of
    anthocyanins, punicalagins, and ellagic acid is substantially less than the photometrically
    measured total polyphenols, though there is a correlation of sorts.', 'Table 2:
    Content of coactive ingredients in various pomegranate preparations.', 'The lower
    part of the table shows the content on coactive compounds in commercially available
    pomegranate preparations, as taken from the references stated and the calculated
    sum of polyphenols in the recommended daily doses.', 'Table 3 lists the individual
    anthocyanidins measured by HPLC, which also allows a distinction to be made between
    pomegranate and elderberry anthocyanidins in the juice concentrate F4.', 'Table
    3: Content of individual anthocyanins expressed as cyanidin-3-glucoside equivalents
    in the pomgranate preparations investigated.', Pomegranate preparations have so
    far been investigated only in patients with prostate cancer., 'In an uncontrolled
    study, patients with rising PSA after surgery or radiation for prostate cancer
    were treated with 240 mL of fermented pomegranate juice per day, containing total
    polyphenols equivalent to 570 mg of gallic acid .', 'The content of coactive compounds
    as assessed by HPLC was not stated but was said in another study  to be similar
    to that in extract POMx, which contained 370 mg punicalagin and 30 mg ellagic
    acid in the daily dosage .', Mean PSA doubling time increased with treatment from
    a mean of 15 months at baseline to 54 months after treatment ., The remaining
    observational study included 104 men with rising PSA but without metastases.,
  Daily doses of either 1000 or 3000 mg of a polyphenol extract of pomegranate were
    given and a liquid extract ., Stenner-Liewen et al., "carried out a phase IIb,
    double-blinded, randomized placebo-controlled trial in patients with histologically
    confirmed prostate cancer in patients with a PSA \u2265 5 ng/mL; this used an
    amount of pomegranate active principle per day, which was only 5% of that investigated
    in the other studies .", 'Unsurprisingly, the study concluded that daily pomegranate
    intake has no impact on PSA levels in patients with advanced prostate cancer.',
  'In our critique of the Cochrane reviews on herbal medicines , we called for rigorous
    declaration of coactive ingredients in study medications to avoid misleading interpretations
    of data.', 'For example, Stenner-Liewen and coworkers  relied on photometric assessments
    of the coactive principle in their study medication, failing to take into account
    the fact that photometric assessments overestimate the true polyphenol content
    by detecting all polyphenolic or antioxidative compounds regardless of their clinical
    activity .', The photometric assessment of the total mixed polyphenols in 500
    mL of the proprietary pomegranate blend was 1147 mg of gallic acid equivalents.,
  'Subtracting the various polyphenols from other components of the blend amounted
    to 445 mg/500 mL; the remaining value of around 700 mg of pomegranate polyphenols
    does not reflect the dose of coactive compounds, our HPLC analysis resulted in
    a total of 20 mg. Bench-mark doses of coactive ingredients are given in the study
    by Paller and coworkers , a total of 400 mg per day as assessed by HPLC.', Thus
    the conclusion of the Stenner-Liewen group that daily pomegranate intake has no
    impact on PSA levels in patients with advanced prostate cancer is wrong since
    it was based on an inadequate amount of coactive ingredients in their pomegranate
    mixture., 'Likewise, similar confusion exists for cranberry products in which
    the photometric assessments do not reflect the true content of coactive ingredients
    .', HPLC assessments provided bench-mark doses for the prevention of urinary tract
    infections ., 'Recently, a significant decrease in PSA levels during treatment
    with pomegranate extract Pomella has been demonstrated in a mouse model of prostate
    cancer.', 'The production of testosterone, DHT, DHEA, androstenedione, androsterone,
    and pregnenolone was inhibited in prostate cancer cell lines and serum steroids
    reduced after 20 weeks of treatment .', 'In metastatic castration-resistant PCa
    cells, POMx exhibited potent in vitro cytotoxicity and in athymic nude mice, the
    extract retarded C4-2 tumor growth in skeleton and significantly enhanced the
    efficacy of docetaxel .', These studies and the experiments mentioned in the Introduction
    of our manuscript suggest that the clinical effectiveness of pomegranate products
    in the treatment of prostate and other cancers deserves further evaluation., A
    diet containing 6% punicalagin given to rats for 37 days caused no obvious toxicity
    ., 'The oral LD50 of a pomegranate extract standardized to 30% punicalagins, 5%
    ellagic acid, and 0.3% gallic acid was found to be greater than 5 g/kg body weight
    in rats and mice.', The respective intraperitoneal LD50s in rats and mice were
    determined as 217 and 187 mg/kg body weight., 'In a subchronic study in rats,
    a diet containing up to 600 mg/kg body weight/day of this extract was given over
    90 days with or without a 28-day recovery phase.', 'Compared with the control
    group, giving the extract did not result in any clinically relevant treatment-related
    organ changes.', 'The "no observed-adverse-effect level" was defined as 600 mg/kg
    body weight/day, the highest extract dose tested .', Pomegranate fruit extract
    exerted an embryoprotective effect against adriamycin-induced oxidative stress
    in 12-day old chick embryos., "After 24 and 48 h of incubation, 70 \u03BCg/egg
    of adriamycin on its own produced a significant dose versus time-dependent reduction
    in body weight and volume of amniotic fluid and a dose-related increase in gross
    embryological deformities and significant changes in the levels of biochemical
    markers in amniotic fluid.", "These changes were significantly reduced by preadministration
    of pomegranate fruit extract at a dose of 200 \u03BCg/egg .", Lead acetate administration
    inhibited spermatogenesis in rats by reducing the length of the stages related
    to spermiation and onset of mitosis., The epididymal sperm number and daily sperm
    production were reduced., Giving ethanolic pomegranate extract along with the
    lead acetate resulted in longer spermiation stages than with the lead acetate
    only., The deleterious effects on epididymal sperm number and daily sperm production
    were reduced., 'Thus, pomegranate may prevent lead acetate-induced spermatogenic
    disruption in rats possibly owing to antioxidant effects .', 'Pomegranate also
    reduced the RNA-damaging effect of doxorubicin, H2O2, and spermine.', Its inhibitory
    activity could be related to its ability to form complexes with doxorubicin and
    H2O2 or its interaction with the intracellular formation of reactive substances
    that mediated their toxicity ., 'In adult Wistar rats, pomegranate juice augmented
    the antioxidant defence mechanism against carbon tetrachloride-induced reproductive
    toxicity .', "In other tests, pomegranate extract was found to be protective against
    methotrexate-induced oxidative bone marrow damage , reduced methotrexate-induced
    neurotoxicity , and reversed methotrexate-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis
    in hepatocytes by modulating Nrf2-NF-\u03BAB pathways in male Swiss albino rats.",
  'Preparations of pomegranate may, thus, help to reduce some adverse effects of methotrexate.',
  'Further tests demonstrated that pomegranate methanolic peel extract inhibited aluminum-induced
    hepatorenal toxicity , mercuric chloride-induced oxidant toxicity  and gentamicin-induced
    nephrotoxicity .', 'Pomegranate seed oil in doses up to 0.64 mg/kg, one hour before
    100 mg/kg of the nephrotoxic agent diazinon had a nephroprotective effect .',
  This has been confirmed with hexachlorobutadiene as the nephrotoxic agent ., The
    "no observable adverse effect level" of pomegranate seed oil was 50.000 ppm PSO
    ., 'In hepatitis induced in rats by D-galactosamine/lipopolysaccharide, a 2-week
    pretreatment with pomegranate juice 20 mL/kg body weight per day protected against
    hepatic damage by suppressing oxidative stress.', Histopathology showed that the
    pomegranate juice restored the hepatic architecture to normal ., Histopathological
    studies of the liver of rats fed pomegranate fruit extract and carbon tetrachloride
    also indicated a hepatoprotective effect., 'Likewise, pomegranate juice protected
    against carbon tetrachloride-induced hepatotoxicity  and nephrotoxicity  and protected
    against ethylene glycol-induced crystal deposition in renal tubules  and the development
    of azoxymethane-induced aberrant crypt foci .', Oral pomegranate extract had a
    protective effect against cisplatin ototoxicity in rats., Cisplatin ototoxicity
    was assessed by analysing "distortion product otoacoustic emissions" 3 days before
    and after the cisplatin injections., Histological changes in the cochleas were
    observed by light microscopy ., This was confirmed in an experimental study with
    aminoglycoside as the ototoxic agent  A whole fruit extract of pomegranate was
    cardioprotective against doxorubicin-induced toxicity ., 'In the chick embryo
    model, doses of whole fruit extract of less than 0.1 mg per embryo were not toxic.',
  'The LD50 of the extract, determined after intraperitoneal administration in mice,
    was 731 mg/kg.', 'At the doses of 0.4 and 1.2 mg/kg of extract, repeated intranasal
    administration to Wistar rats produced no toxic effects in terms of food intake,
    weight gain, behavioural or biochemical measurables, nor was it associated with
    histopathological changes .', Aqueous and lipophilic pomegranate peel extracts
    have demonstrated a dose-dependent antimutagenic activity in Salmonella typhimurium
    strains ; this was probably attributable to the content on ellagitannins ., No
    toxic effects were observed in mice treated with aqueous pomegranate fruit extracts
    ., A study in Swiss mice treated with ethanolic extracts of pomegranate leaf or
    fruit confirmed the absence of mutagenic effects and the dose-dependent protective
    effects against cyclophosphamide-induced oxidative DNA damage ., 'However, a later
    study was carried out on the genotoxicity of whole pomegranate fruit extract using
    different in vitro and in vivo assays to detect DNA damage at different expression
    levels: it indicated that this extract can induce genetic damage at different
    expression levels: recombinogenic, mutagenic, and clastogenic .', 'Thus, the use
    of this extract may well carry a genetic risk and an analysis of the balance of
    risk and benefit is probably crucial.', 'Whereas pomegranate bark  and root  contain
    toxic alkaloids, the presence of alkaloids in peel was considered equivocal .',
  Studies of cytotoxicity affecting the Caco-2 cell line and human peripheral blood
    mononuclear cells could provide preliminary information about toxicity on intestinal
    cancer cells and normal cells., "The effective dose of pomegranate peel extract
    for stimulating proliferation in Caco-2 cells was 4.7 \u03BCg/mL and for PBMCs
    44.4 \u03BCg/mL .", One should therefore be cautious about using peel extract
    in humans as a natural dietary antioxidant or a therapy., 'However, one should
    also note that the toxic effects of pomegranate fruit extract occurred at higher
    doses than the doses used either those in animal experiments or in Cuban folk
    medicine .', 'In the clinical study investigating a pomegranate extract in doses
    of 1000 and 3000 mg, diarrhea occurred more often in the high dose group .', Heber
    et al., carried out two clinical pilot studies on the safety of a pomegranate
    ellagitannin-enriched polyphenol extract., 'Sixty-four overweight individuals
    took one, two, or three 710 mg capsules per day of pomegranate extract for 28
    days, each capsule containing 435 mg of gallic acid equivalents.', 'In none of
    the subjects were there any serious adverse events on complete blood count, blood
    chemistry, and urinalysis.', 'In another 22 overweight subjects, levels of thiobarbituric
    acid reactive substances were significantly less after receiving 1000 mg pomegranate
    extract versus baseline measurements.', Diabetic indicators were not worsened
    in diabetic patients taking pomegranate juice; serum lipid peroxidases were reduced
    by 56% and TBSARs by 24% whereas serum SH groups increased by 12% and paraoxonase
    activity by 24% ., 'In other clinical studies, consumption of pomegranate juice
    or extracts were also well tolerated .', No toxic effects were seen in a one-year
    pilot study of the proprietary pomegranate extract POMx in 10 patients with carotid
    artery stenosis ., 'Interestingly, the improvement in clinical signs took place
    during the first 12 months of the study but was maintained over the following
    2 years.', Pomegranate fruit and peel extracts have so far been used safely from
    a toxicological perspective ., Allergies to pomegranate may occur but are very
    rare ., 'One case report described exercise-induced anaphylaxis triggered by the
    ingestion of pomegranate, the allergy being confirmed by immunoblotting and absence
    of lipid transfer protein cross-reactivity, although exercise-induced anaphylaxis
    is generally independent of the kind of food ingested before exercise .', Mannitol
    which is also contained in pomegranate has been identified as causing IgE-mediated
    hypersensitivity ., 'If pomegranate preparations are taken over longer periods,
    putative interactions with other medications need to be considered.', This is
    because the pomegranate active principle interacts with hepatic cytochrome P450
    ., "The in vitro 1\u2032-hydroxylase activity of midazolam, catalysed by human
    CYP3A, was inhibited less by a commercial pomegranate juice than by the juices
    from grapefruit, black mulberry, and wild grape .", 'Pomegranate juice did not
    impair the clearance of oral or intravenous midazolam in volunteers, .', 'However,
    rhabdomyolysis has been associated with pomegranate juice consumption in a patient
    taking synthetic rosuvastatin, though the latter is not known to be metabolized
    by hepatic P450 3A4 .', More studies are needed to determine whether these and
    other interactions such as the interaction between pomegranate-containing products
    and the immunosuppressive agent tacrolimus  are clinically significant ., 'The
    review of the literature indicates that the active principle of pomegranate may
    well have a potent anticancer potential, but the clinical evidence of effectiveness
    is still poor because of the poor quality of the available clinical studies.',
  Hong and coworkers described the POMx extract as containing monomeric and oligomeric
    ellagitannins but no anthocyanins as determined by high performance-liquid chromatography.,
  'Thus, a dose of 1000 mg of extract contained 400 mg of both ellagitannins.', Paller
    et al., 'stated that each POMx capsule contained 1000 mg of polyphenol extract,
    comparable to about 8 oz of pomegranate juice.', 'According to the "POM wonderful
    pomegranate juice monograph" of the American Botanical Council , the juice contained
    1.74 mg/mL punicalagin and 0.14 mg/mL ellagic acid, a dose of 94 mg all together
    in 240 mL.', According to the voice message from the company one POMx pill contained
    370 mg punicalagin., This dose has also been mentioned in the review by Kroeger
    et al., ., 'But according to our measurements, POMx capsules contained only 132
    mg of punicalagin and ellagic acid.', 'Since 3000 mg have not been more effective
    than 1000 mg, the optimum dose until a ceiling effect occurs may be in between
    these doses or the ceiling effect may even occur at a dose less than 1000 mg.',
  This needs to be clarified in a careful dose-finding study., 'A competing company
    has developed their extract POMELLA based on work at the University of California,
    Los Angeles.', The extract is standardized by HPLC on 30% of punicalagins in addition
    to smaller amounts of other marker compounds that exist at concentrations less
    than 5%., Batch contained 300 mg/1000 mg punicalagin and 20 mg/ellagic acid/1000
    mg. A daily dose of 1000 mg of this extract contains at least 320 mg of total
    polyphenols and is presently being tested in a clinical study ., 'The photometrically
    assessed polyphenol content varies between 60 and 70%


    For colorimetric quantification of polyphenolic antioxidants in general, the Folin-Ciocalteu
    assay is used with gallic acid as reference .', 'Theoretically, however, any polyphenol
    could be used as reference compound).', Martin et al., proposed replacing gallic
    acid by a purified pomegranate pomace extract in the Folin-Ciocalteu assay., This
    purified extract contained at least 5.6% nonpolyphenols) compared with 9.1% in
    the raw POMx extract ., The polyphenolic composition of this purified extract
    has not been quantified in terms of pure reference compounds., Data are not presented
    as absolute values but as rough estimates of polyphenol contents expressed as
    percentages of total polyphenols., 'When POMx extract was analyzed by Folin-Ciocalteu
    using the purified extract as reference, the result was 92.6%.', 'This percentage
    does not necessarily reflect 92.6% of polyphenols, since the absolute polyphenolic
    content of the purified pomegranate pomace extract has not been analysed.', 'Thus,
    though the purified pomegranate pomace extract may well be appropriate for quality
    control of the POMx extraction process, it does not allow quantification of polyphenols
    in pomegranate products as suggested by Martin et al.', ., The 15.7% of punicalagin
    expressed as a percentage of the 92.6% total polyphenols suggests a putative absolute
    value of 14.5% of punicalagin in POMx., It remains questionable why POMx has been
    characterized as extract standardized on 37-40% punicalagin assessed by HPLC .,
  The Folin-Ciocalteu assay has never claimed to reflect the absolute polyphenol content
    of a sample., It has been designed as an index for comparing similar samples  by
    using gallic acid as reference compound., The Folin-Ciocalteu values were not
    declared on the POMx capsules we bought., 'Pomegranate preparations can contain
    up to 48 phenolic compounds, and the complexity of their polyphenolic profiles
    necessitates the use of hyphenated techniques for a thorough evaluation of their
    composition .', 'For reasons of expense, only punicalagin, ellagic acid, and anthocyanins
    are measured in routine laboratories despite the presence of larger concentrations
    of other ellagitannins in processed pomegranate preparations, as shown by Fischer
    et al.', 2011 ., 'Although, if all polyphenols in pure pomegranate preparations
    were included in the HPLC analysis, resulting estimates of total polyphenol content
    correlated well with photometric estimates, the correlations were very poor if
    only punicalagin, ellagic acid, and anthocyanins were used.', Our results substantiate
    this., 'Standardization of products solely on photometric assessments can be misleading
    and the content of punicalagin, ellagic acid, and anthocyanins as assessed by
    routine HPLC should be declared on product labels in addition to the photometric
    estimates.', 'Both indicators should replace descriptions such as the one that
    came with the extract "Ultra Granatapfel forte," claiming that "the punicalagin
    dose in one capsule is equivalent to 840 mL mother juice".', Such information
    is unhelpful because one 500 mg capsule contained only 20 mg polyphenols as assessed
    by HPLC., 'Depending on what is taken as the benchmark daily dose for prostate
    cancer--130 or 400 mg ellagitannins--, many capsules of this product may need
    to be taken daily, which would be inconvenient as well as expensive.', 'The dose
    of oral pomegranate fruit extract chosen in mice to inhibit tumorigenesis was
    based on the assumption that a typical healthy 70 kg individual may be persuaded
    to drink 500 mL of pomegranate juice extracted from two fruits , containing a
    putative polyphenol dose of around 350 mg per day.', 'Of the products investigated,
    this dose is contained in 1000 mg of POMx extract if we can rely on the study
    by Hong et al.', 'or 3 POMx capsules as currently available, in 350 mL of pure
    juice L3074, in 12 mL of the concentrated fermented juice F4 supplemented with
    elderberry concentrate, in 2-3 of the proprietary capsules GranaProstan, or in
    16 of the proprietary capsules Ultra Granatapfel forte.', 'Though these doses
    are large, they can be used safely in patients .', 'Tables 2 and 3 show that the
    quantity and the spectrum of phenolic compounds vary greatly in different products,
    depending partly on the ripeness of the fruits .', 'Fresh pomegranates contained
    between 11 and 1543 mg anthocyanins/L depending on the colour of the variety,
    white, rose, dark red, and purple .', Fresh juices contained 904 to 2067 mg/L
    of total phenols as assessed by Folin-Ciocalteu ., This is in accordance with
    the study by Gomez-Caravaca and coworkers  who found that the total phenolic content
    ranged from 581 to 2551 mg/L in the pomegranate juices they investigated., Table
    2 shows that only one of our pure juices was within this range., 'Our anthocyanin:
    polyphenol ratios were lower than those reported by Gomez-Caravaca and coworkers
    , which varied between 20 to 82%; this may well indicate anthocyanin degradation
    in the samples we analysed.', 'Reductions or losses of phenolic compounds have
    been reported in commercial juices, and these have been attributed to commercial
    processing procedures .', 'Although mother juices should contain more polyphenols
    than blended juices, only 3 of 6 pure juices were rich in ellagitannins and antioxidant
    capacity.', Only one of the 6 pure juices that were rich in ellagitannin was also
    rich in anthocyanins., Some of the other pure juices had even a lower antioxidant
    capacity than blended juices., In some juices the antioxidant capacity was attributable
    to vitamin C rather than to phenolic compounds ., Vitamin C may preserve coactive
    compounds ., 'Factors affecting the stability of anthocyanins in juices include
    pH, the presence of enzymes and copigments such as metallic ions and sugars and,
    such processing features as the intensity and duration of heating, the storage
    temperature, and time and the presence of oxygen and/or light.', Short-term thermal
    treatments decreased the percentage of polymeric anthocyanins and increased the
    amount of monomeric anthocyanins and thus the bioavailability of coactive compounds
    ., Pasteurization had no influence on the total polyphenols and antioxidant capacity
    of juices., 'However, the storage temperature was the main factor affecting all
    coactive compounds, the total monomeric and individual anthocyanins, the total
    phenolic compounds, and therefore also the antioxidant activity .', "Fast degradation
    of anthocyanins was observed in juices stored at 25\xB0C, while refrigerated storage
    at 5\xB0C resulted in much slower degradation.", 'Cyanidin-3-O-glucoside was less
    stable than delphinidin- and cyanidin-3,5-diglucosides.', There was a linear relationship
    between total monomeric anthocyanins and antioxidative capacity ., 'Consistently,
    liquid pomegranate peel extracts had acceptable thermal stability after sterilization
    and storage at low temperature .', Longer thermal treatment of juices resulted
    in total anthocyanin losses ranging from 76% to 87% of the initial anthocyanin
    levels., The anthocyanin stability was independent of the total phenolic content
    and of low and high molecular weight pomegranate matrix components ., Exposure
    to light during storage also affects loss of coactive compound ., 'Good correlation
    of the anthocyanins with red colour was observed for all samples at elevated temperatures,
    but the visual appearance did not adequately reflect the quality and storage stability
    of pomegranate juices .', Ellagitannins seem to be the major antioxidants in pomegranate
    juices ., Commercial juices from whole pomegranates contained about 1500-1900
    mg/L punicalagin while only traces of this compound were detected in self-made
    freshly squeezed juice from pomegranate arils., The ellagitannins in extracts
    from whole pomegranate are therefore derived from the peel ., Punicalagin concentrations
    ranged from 1100 to 2000 mg/kg dry matter of mesocarp and peel and from 4 to 565
    mg/L in aril juices ., The punicalagin contents in the two pure juices analysed
    here are within or above this range., For the whole pomegranate fruit extracts
    the punicalagin content of 95% relative to the total polyphenols and the low anthocyanin
    content of around 1% reflect the extraction from whole pomegranates., The anthocyanins
    in the F4 preparation are derived from the additional elderberry as revealed by
    the individual elderberry anthocyanin components., 'Homogenates prepared from
    the whole fruit showed about a 20-fold higher antioxidant activity than did aril
    homogenates, which correlated significantly with the content of the four major
    hydrolyzable tannins .', 'Likewise, when extracted with an ethanol-acetone extraction
    solvent, pomegranate peel showed greater antioxidant capacity than did pulp.',
  'This was consistent with the higher contents of total phenolics, flavonoids, and
    proanthocyanidins in the peel extract .', No correlation between antioxidant activity
    and level of anthocyanins was found ., 'When polyphenols purified from peel containing
    juice products were compared with those from peel-free juice, the radical scavenging
    effect was lower with the latter .', Juicing with peel made the juice bitter and
    astringent ., 'When 19 pomegranate food supplements were compared, only a limited
    number of pomegranate supplements were believably authentic.', Product labels
    were inconsistent with polyphenol composition and antioxidant content., Thirteen
    samples contained disproportionately large amounts of ellagic acid and low or
    no detectable pomegranate tannins., Only six products had a tannin profile consistent
    with pomegranate., 'Natural pomegranate extract was the most representative of
    pomegranate fruit polyphenols with 99% total pomegranate polyphenol and the highest
    antioxidant capacity across all measures should vary between 1.9, and 45 g/L and
    malic acid should never be present.', 'A comparative analysis of pomegranate juices
    and concentrates verified that many commercial products are mixed with sugar,
    colouring ingredients, and other fruit juices : these may or may not influence
    therapeutic effectiveness.', 'Processing conditions of the fruits, that is, coextraction
    of arils and peel and pressure, markedly affected the profiles and contents of
    phenolics in the pomegranate juices , underlining the necessity to optimise these
    features for obtaining products with well-defined and reproducible functional
    properties .', 'Heating plus refrigeration may help to reduce anthocyanin degradation
    in pasteurized pomegranate juice, avoiding a dramatic impact on its colour and
    preserving the beneficial effects .', Future research should identify the optimum
    coactive compound composition of a pomegranate preparation for the treatment of
    prostate cancer  with the primary outcome of 5-year survival., Declaration of
    the content of coactive constituents helps to identify quality products., 'However,
    direct evidence for bioequivalence between products can only come from well-planned
    clinical studies.', 'Because of the complexity of the coactive pomegranate compounds,
    similar bioavailabilities of coactive compounds cannot provide indirect evidence
    for bioequivalence unless the clinical effectiveness for the leading polyphenol
    mixture has been confidently established .', 'This is because bioequivalence requires
    not only pharmaceutical similarity of components, but also their pharmacological
    and therapeutic equivalence.', Ellagic acid and its metabolites are found in human
    plasma after ingestion of pomegranate., Its antioxidant capacity was retained
    ex vivo ., "An average ellagic acid serum concentration of 0.14 \u03BCM/L was
    attained after consumption of a proprietary pomegranate extract and was associated
    with a putative anticancer effect .", "Although similar ellagic acid serum concentrations
    were attained after taking extract or juice , another study showed lower concentrations
    of 0.06 \u03BCM/L after drinking 180 mL of a pomegranate juice .", 'As long as
    we do not know which polyphenol is responsible for the putative anticancer effect,
    it is unwise to base dosing of pomegranate products on ellagic acid, because serum
    ellagic acid or its metabolites are the metabolites of various oligomeric polyphenols.',
  Pharmacodynamic or ex vivo/in vitro tests are not surrogates for bioequivalence
    unless the results can be shown to correlate with therapeutic effectiveness .,
  'In summary, there is evidence that pomegranate has a putative anticancerogenic
    effect in prostate cancer and can safely be used in high doses.', But commercial
    pomegranate products vary greatly in their content of coactive ingredients., 'For
    reasons of transparency, consumers should know not only the photometric quantification
    of the polyphenols in the daily recommended dosage, but also the content of HPLC-analysed
    polyphenols.', Only then can they choose a dose that has a chance of being effective
    in the treatment of cancer., The preparation of pomegranate end-products is affected
    by many determinants., Their declaration should be incorporated into the regulatory
    guidance and controlled before pomegranate products are allowed on the market.,
  The authors declare that there is no conflict of interests regarding the publication
