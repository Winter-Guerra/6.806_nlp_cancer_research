    breast cancer HR and 95% CI associated with participant characteristics and fatty
    acids from diet., 'Age was used as the survival time metric, with participants
    entering regression models at the age they completed the baseline questionnaire

    each category are given, with the exception of PUFAs EPA, DHA, and arachidonic

    of total MUFAs was significantly associated with an increased risk of breast cancer;
    comparing the highest vs. the lowest quintile of intake, the HR was 1.61.', 'Intake
    of the most abundant MUFA, oleic acid was suggestive of an increased risk of breast
    cancer, but the P for trend was not significant.', 'Among the MUFAs consumed in
    smaller quantities, myristoleic acid was associated with an increased breast cancer
    risk and erucic acid was associated with a reduction in risk.', Intake of other
    MUFAs was not significantly associated with breast cancer risk., 'In addition,
    none of the 10 foods highest in total MUFAs in the food database were associated
    with breast cancer, with the exception of fried chicken.', 'For total SFA and
    TFA intake, some point estimates were elevated, but the P values for trend did
    not reach statistical significance.', 'The 2 fatty acids that contribute the most
    to SFA intake, palmitic acid and stearic acid, were each significantly and linearly
    associated with increased breast cancer risk.', 'Of the SFAs consumed in smaller
    quantities, only margaric acid was associated with risk.', 'Among TFAs, only dietary
    intake of TFA 18:2 was significantly associated with breast cancer risk.', 'We
    observed no association between total PUFA intake and breast cancer risk; however,
    dietary plus supplemental intake of eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic
    acid were inversely associated with breast cancer risk, and tests for linear trend
    were statistically significant.', 'When only dietary intake was considered, findings
    remained suggestive of an inverse association for EPA and DHA.', "The short-chain
    \u03C9-3 \u03B1-linolenic acid and \u03C9-6 PUFAs linoleic acid and arachidonic
    acid were not associated with breast cancer risk.", "Finally, the ratio of long-chain
    \u03C9-3 PUFA intake to \u03C9-6 PUFA intake was not associated with breast cancer

    cancer incidence.', 'Specifically, intakes of total MUFA, the main contributors
    to SFA intake palmitic acid and stearic acid, and the 18:2 trans fat, linolelaidic
    acid, were associated with increased risks of breast cancer.', Dietary plus supplemental

    of specific proteins can cause them to be preferentially localized and anchored

    fatty acids may be causing key changes in the localization and function of proteins
    important for tumor suppression.', Dietary fats may also affect breast cancer
    risk by altering the membranes of the cells of the immune system (5555\., 'Escrich

    Inst, 100: 443\u2013444.", "author reply 444\u2013445  \n\nThe strengths of this
    study are the relatively large size of the cohort, the prospective design that
    minimizes selection bias and differential measurement error, and the detailed
    FFQ, which was designed for more complete ascertainment of amounts and types of
    fat consumed over prior versions.", "In addition, we were able to ascertain fish
    oil supplement data to include in our assessment of intake of \u03C9-3 PUFAs.",
  One of the main limitations of this study is the measurement error due to self-reported
    food consumption., 'However, any error would be nondifferential in relation to
    disease status and would have led to attenuation of results.', 'Another limitation
    in the interpretation of our results is that although we found associations between
    intake of several fatty acids and breast cancer risk, it is possible that other
    constituents of the foods high in the fatty acids of interest, including other
    fatty acids, could be responsible for the increased risk.', 'Foods that are highest
    in total MUFAs per serving include fried chicken, beef/pork/ham/lamb eaten with
    the fat, peanut butter and nuts, fried fish, doughnuts/pies/pastries, regular
    hot dogs and sausage, pizza, olive oil, and ground meat.', 'MUFAs, as well as
    PUFAs, are inherently more sensitive to oxidation at high heat during frying because
    of their double bonds.', Thus any harmful effect may be due to chemical alterations
    to MUFAs during cooking., 'This is supported by our analysis of the foods highest
    in MUFAs: Only fried chicken was associated with breast cancer risk.', It is possible
    that our findings reflect associations with other constituents of these foods.,
  'In addition, although the individual SFAs that were associated with breast cancer
    risk in this study are found in a large number of foods, they tend to occur together
    in the same foods, so one cannot separate their independent effects.', 'However,
    it is unlikely that all SFAs have the same association with breast cancer risk
    because the 2 most abundant SFAs only accounted for about one-half of intake of
    total SFAs, and the other SFAs were not associated with breast cancer risk.',
  Another concern is residual confounding due to mismeasured or missing covariates
    in our analyses of fatty acids and foods., 'Also, our significant results only
    appeared after multivariate adjustment, primarily because of adjustment for energy
    intake.', "Adjustment for energy intake serves 2 purposes: 1) it \u201Ccalibrates\u201D
    intake based on the amount of energy consumed, which may be more biologically
    relevant than absolute intake, and 2) it corrects for 1 component of measurement
    error in a FFQ.", Thus the difference between the age-adjusted and fully adjusted
    results reflects these 2 types of corrections., "In summary, in this cohort study
    of postmenopausal women, we found total MUFA intake and intake of specific MUFAs,
    SFAs, and TFAs to be associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, and long-chain
    \u03C9-3 PUFAs associated with reduced risks of breast cancer.", 'Although further
    study of specific fatty acids is needed, this study provides further support for
    the hypothesis that fat consumption is associated with breast cancer risk and
    suggests that risk varies by type of fatty acid.', 'This work is supported by
    grants R25CA094880 and K05CA154337 from the National Institutes of Health, National
    Cancer Institute, and Office of Dietary Supplements.']
