[Pomegranate extract inhibits the proliferation of breast cancer cells and stimulates
    apoptosis in MCF-7 breast cancer cells., 'While PE is a potent antioxidant, the
    present studies were conducted to examine the mechanisms of action of PE beyond
    antioxidation by studying cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying breast
    tumorigenesis.', PE inhibited cell growth by inducing cell cycle arrest in G2/M
    followed by the induction of apoptosis., 'In contrast, antioxidants N-acetylcysteine
    and Trolox did not affect cell growth at doses containing equivalent antioxidant
    capacity as PE, suggesting that growth inhibition by PE cannot solely be attributed
    to its high antioxidant potential.', 'DNA microarray analysis revealed that PE
    downregulated genes associated with mitosis, chromosome organization, RNA processing,
    DNA replication and DNA repair, and upregulated genes involved in regulation of
    apoptosis and cell proliferation.', 'Both microarray and quantitative RT-PCR indicated
    that PE downregulated important genes involved in DNA double strand break repair
    by homologous recombination, such as MRE11, RAD50, NBS1, RAD51, BRCA1, BRCA2,
    and BRCC3.', 'Downregulation of HR genes correlated with increased levels of their
    predicted microRNAs, miR-183 and miR-24, suggesting that PE may regulate miRNAs
    involved in DNA repair processes.', 'Further, PE treatment increased the frequency
    of DSBs.', 'These data suggest that PE downregulates HR which sensitizes cells
    to DSBs, growth inhibition and apoptosis.', 'Because HR represents a novel target
    for cancer therapy, downregulation of HR by PE may be exploited for sensitization
    of tumors to anticancer drugs.', 'Copyright 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

























    Pomegranate is consumed as whole fruit and also widely available commercially
    as fruit juice, wine, or sauce .', 'The fruit can be divided into three parts:
    the seeds, the juice, and the peel.', Extracts of all parts of the fruit appear
    to have therapeutic properties., Pomegranate fruit is a rich source of many phenolic
    compounds including flavonoids and hydrolyzable tannins called ellagitannins .,
  The concentration of total polyphenols in pomegranate juice is higher than other
    fruit juices ., 'In turn, pomegranate juice has the highest antioxidant capacity

    blueberry juice, and green tea .', The potent antioxidant properties of pomegranate
    juice have been thought to be responsible for various health benefits., 'However,
    it has not been established whether antioxidant effects per se can explain the
    actions of pomegranate juice in inhibiting tumor cell growth in vitro.', 'The

    catalyzes conversion of estrone to estradiol .", Estradiol has been suggested
    to increase the risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal women leading to recommendations
    that dietary interventions that reduce estrogen synthesis may be beneficial for
    cancer prevention ., 'In summary, these studies suggested that pomegranate intake
    can modulate tumor behavior by reducing growth and/or invasiveness as well as
    suppressing hormonal carcinogenesis through reduction of estrogen levels and/or
    activity.', 'While the beneficial properties of pomegranate are being investigated,
    the studies of its adverse effects have not been neglected either.', 'Subchronic

  We also examined the effect of PE pretreatment., Cells maintained in PE-free medium
    after PE pretreatment showed about threefold reduction or 48 h delay in cell growth
    in comparison to their respective controls., This suggested that PE-gene interactions
    established during treatment were responsible for the sustained growth arrest.,
  We determined whether cell growth inhibition by PE is due to its antioxidant actions.,
  'We used TEAC assay to compare antioxidant capacity of PE, NAC, and Trolox in terms
    of TEs.', "For example, antioxidant capacity of 50 \xB5g/mL of PE was found to
    be equivalent to 40 \xB5g/mL of NAC and 75 \xB5g/mL of Trolox.", 'Growth inhibition
    of equivalent doses of PE, NAC, and Trolox is shown in Figure 1D.', 'In agreement
    with the results in Figure 1A, PE inhibited cell growth in a dose-dependent manner.',
  'However, NAC or Trolox at doses containing equivalent antioxidant capacity as PE
    did not inhibit cell growth.', This indicated that the growth-inhibitory action
    of PE cannot solely be attributed to its antioxidant capacity., NAC is known to
    inhibit cancer cell growth but at concentrations that are three orders of magnitude
    higher than used in our study  while cytostatic doses of Trolox have not been
    established., "Consistent with the cell viability assay results flow cytometric

    50 \xB5g/mL of PE treatment for 48 h. PE treated cells accumulated in G2 phase
    possibly due to G2/M cell cycle arrest and also underwent apoptosis.", The degree
    of cell cycle inhibition was similar at 24 and 72 h. These results indicate that

  'DNA damage response and repair genes including MRE11, RAD50, NBS1, RAD51, BRCA1,
    BRCA2, BRCC3, and MSH6 that were downregulated in microarrays, showed a reduction
    in mRNA levels over a period of 72 h, where the greatest reduction was observed
    at 72 h. The importance of these genes is underscored by the fact that the proteins
    encoded by RAD50, NBS, and MRE11 form the MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 complex, which acts
    as double strand break sensor, maintains genome stability during replication,
    promotes homologous recombination repair, activates ATM for recruitment to damaged
    DNA and is essential for cell viability .', RAD51 is a central player in most

    addition, we performed qRT-PCR for some of the known PE targets, such as JNK-2,
    AKT, and PI3K genes, which did not appear to be significantly altered in our microarray
    analysis, but were indicated as potential upstream players of DNA repair and cell
    cycle control by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis.', The observed fold-change reduction
    in mRNA levels of these genes is consistent with the reduction in their protein
    levels and/or activity reported in other studies ., IPA identified a highly significant
    network associated with DNA repair and M-phase GO-terms., The network involves
    the genes that were differentially expressed by PE treatment and thus provides
    a valuable model for understanding the complex mechanism of PE mediated growth
    inhibition., Figure 5\., Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of significantly downregulated

  'Binding of short noncoding RNA, miRNA, to the target mRNA can lead to mRNA degradation
    or translational repression.', Dietary compounds were shown to modify miRNAs involved
    in a variety of biological processes but whether PE can regulate miRNAs involved
    in DNA repair is unknown ., 'We used three different bioinformatics algorithms,

    score.', Screening for common miRNAs in two or more bioinformatics programs increases
    the rate of known target prediction to 72.6% and up to 100% for evolutionary conserved

    which strongly increases the probability that RAD50 is a target of miR-183.",
  "We also chose to examine miR-24, which has seedless binding sites in the 3\u2032UTR
    of genes downregulated in our microarray including BRCA1, E2F2, and CCNA2.", 'Importantly,
    BRCA1, E2F2, and CCNA2 genes have been validated experimentally by luciferase
    assay as being direct targets of miR-24 .', PE treatment resulted in a significant
    upregulation of miR-183 and miR-24 but not miR-132., Increased miR-183 levels
    correlated inversely with mRNA levels of RAD50 suggesting a possible communication
    between miR-183 and RAD50., 'Similarly, there was an inverse correlation between
    miR-24 and mRNA levels of BRCA1, E2F2, and CCNA2.', 'In summary, these data are
    suggestive that PE may upregulate miRNAs involved in DNA repair and cell cycle
    control but further experimentation is needed.', Figure 7\., Changes in miRNA
    expression levels after PE treatment., 'Relative fold-change was determined by
    qRT-PCR, P &lt; 0.05, compared to respective control.', 'miR-24 targets BRCA1,
    E2F2, and CCNA2, miR-183 is predicted to target RAD50 and miR-132 is predicted
    to target BRCA1.', The observations in the present study demonstrate cellular
    and molecular actions of PE beyond antioxidation in MCF-7 cells including evidence
    of downregulation of DNA repair., 'While earlier studies have reported growth
    inhibitory, proapoptotic, and antiinvasive properties of PE in different cancer
    cell lines , this is the first study to demonstrate that PE may affect DNA repair
    pathway required for the survival of cancer cells.', 'Consistent with earlier
    reports, our study confirmed that PE treatment inhibited cancer cell growth in
    a dose- and time-dependent manner, as assessed by two independent cell growth
    and viability assays.', Growth inhibition was associated with the G2/M cell cycle
    arrest and the induction of apoptosis., 'Secondly, PE pretreatment significantly
    delayed cell growth.', 'This finding may be of clinical relevance and suggests
    that intermittent exposure to PE dietary supplements might be effective without
    compromising anticancer activities, which may be deemed as a more feasible dietary
    approach.', 'Thirdly, comparative growth inhibition assessment of PE, NAC, and
    Trolox suggests that the growth inhibition by PE is not solely attributed to its
    high antioxidant potential.', 'This was a strong rationale for investigation of
    other possible mechanisms of action, for which we employed Affymetrix microarrays.',
  Microarray analysis showed that PE treatment significantly modulated over 900 genes.,
  'The most enriched GO-terms among downregulated genes included mitosis, chromosomal
    organization, RNA processing, DNA replication, DNA damage response, and DNA repair,
    whereas the most enriched GO-terms among upregulated genes included regulation
    of apoptosis and regulation of cell proliferation.', 'Although many of these cellular
    processes may control cell growth and death, this study links for the first time
    PE exposure and downregulation of DNA repair genes.', 'Of particular interest,
    most of the DNA repair genes that were downregulated by PE are involved in HR-mediated
    repair .', "For example, the MRN complex together with CtIP facilitates 5\u2032-3\u2032
    resection of DSB ends required for initiation of HR.", 'BRCA1 interacts with both
    MRN and CtIP and may be involved in end resection, although BRCA1 has pleiotropic
    functions and its exact role in HR is difficult to dissect.', 'On the contrary,
    BRCA2 is predominantly involved in HR.', "The 3\u2032-single-stranded DNA overhang
    generated during end resection is bound to replication protein A, which is required
    for subsequent recruitment of RAD51.", BRCA2 displaces RPA and facilitates loading
    of RAD51 onto single-stranded DNA., 'RAD51 forms the nucleoprotein filament that
    catalyzes strand exchange during which single-stranded DNA invades homologous
    duplex DNA forming a displacement loop, required for subsequent HR reactions.',
  BRCA2 binds RAD51 through interactions with a series of eight short conserved repeats
    stimulating nucleoprotein filament formation., 'Also, BRCA2 itself binds to single-stranded
    DNA.', Both BRCA1 and BRCA2 deficient cells are defective for HR., The role of
    BRCC3 in HR is uncertain., 'However, it directly interacts with BRCA1 and is required
    for ionizing radiation-induced BRCA1 phosphorylation and nuclear foci formation
    .', 'Importantly, BRCC3 is aberrantly expressed in the majority of breast cancer
    cell lines and in invasive ductal carcinomas, suggesting a potential role in breast
    cancer .', 'MSH6, a mismatch repair protein, has also been linked to HR.', 'MSH6
    has been shown to co-localize with BLM, p53, and RAD51 in hydroxyurea-induced
    RAD51 nuclear foci that may correspond to the sites of presumed stalled DNA replication
    forks, which are subject to HR repair .', 'Altogether, this illustrates that PE
    may influence multiple steps of the HR reaction.', 'HR pathway is only active
    during the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle since the sister chromatid, a preferential
    substrate for HR, is present only after DNA replication .', It is possible that
    HR could use homologous chromosomes for DSB repair in the G1 phase but this would
    result in genome rearrangements., 'To avert this scenario, HR is controlled not
    only by DNA damage response signaling pathways but also cell cycle regulators
    as well as chromatin remodeling factors .', 'In our study, PE-treated cells were
    arrested in G2/M, which provides a time and substrate for HR to occur.', 'However,
    we also found that important chromatin remodeling genes were downregulated by
    PE.', 'As noted above, HR occurs predominantly in replicating cells, while an
    alternative DSB repair pathway, nonhomologous end joining, prevails in quiescent
    and postmitotic cells.', 'Thus, it is reasonable to assume that HR is essential
    for the maintenance and viability of cancer cells but not normal quiescent cells.',
  'To support this notion, a study using Rad50 conditional knock-out mice showed that
    depletion of Rad50 in cultured cells caused extensive DNA damage and death within
    3-5 d. On the contrary, Rad50 was dispensable for viability of quiescent and postmitotic
    tissues .', These findings support the idea that HR is not essential in nondividing
    cells., 'In agreement with this, HR was found to be spontaneously increased in
    breast cancer cells while NHEJ was not, as shown by plasmid reporter assays measuring
    DSB repair by HR and/or NHEJ .', 'In addition to DSB repair, HR also repairs stalled
    and collapsed replication forks.', 'There is experimental evidence suggesting
    that DSBs are not the primary substrate for HR in mitotic cells, whereas most
    spontaneous HR in mitotic cells is induced by stalled replication forks .', Both
    unrepaired DSBs and replication-associated lesions will ultimately culminate in
    cell death., 'Our findings that PE downregulated the MRN complex subunits, MRE11,
    RAD50, NBS1, and RAD51, BRCA1, BRCA2, BRCC3, and MSH6, and increased DSBs, suggest
    that these may be the possible causes for reduced cancer cell survival following
    PE treatment.', The mechanism of downregulation of DNA repair genes by PE is currently
    unclear., Our study suggests that miRNAs may be among the possible regulators.,
  'We found that PE treatment upregulated miR-183 and miR-24 that are predicted to
    target RAD50 and BRCA1, respectively.', 'Experimental validation will confirm
    whether RAD50 is a direct target of miR-183, while BRCA1 has already been validated
    as miR-24 target .', 'In addition to spontaneous damage, HR is involved in the
    repair of DNA damage induced by cancer drugs .', Inhibition of HR amplifies toxic
    replication-associated DNA lesions that directly result in cell death., HR inhibitors
    are therefore predicted to be highly efficient at killing tumors., Some newly
    developed drugs that enhance tumor chemosensitivity and radiosensitivity were
    shown to target HR ., 'Also, downregulation of HR genes, BRCA2 and RAD51, by interference
    RNA approach sensitizes cancer cells to chemotherapeutics .', Whether PE exclusively
    downregulates DNA repair genes in cancer cells is unknown., 'Irrespective of this,
    because the MRN complex is dispensable for the maintenance and viability of postmitotic
    tissues and HR is only active in replicating cells, it is likely that downregulation
    of HR in normal tissues would have only a minor effect, provided the NHEJ pathway
    is intact .', 'Thus, our study showing that PE downregulates HR genes warrants
    further investigations regarding the use of PE as a nontoxic HR inhibitor available
    in the form of a whole fruit, fruit juice, or a dietary supplement pill.', 'At
    present, it is unknown whether PE downregulates HR in vivo.', 'Likewise, it is
    unclear whether equivalent concentrations of PE ellagitannins can be achieved
    in humans, compounded by the occurrence of different PE metabolites in cultured
    cells and human tissues.', 'In humans, ellagitannins are hydrolyzed to ellagic
    acid and further converted by gut microflora to bioavailable urolithins .', 'Ellagic
    acid and urolithins undergo conjugation with methyl, glucuronyl, and sulfate groups
    and are found in plasma and excreted in the urine .', 'Ellagitannin metabolism,
    which may be dependent on the intestinal flora or bowel transit time, shows considerable
    inter-individual variability .', 'Punicalagin, which is the major ellagitannin
    present in pomegranate juice and occurs as isomers, was not detected in plasma
    or urine in humans after consumption of pomegranate juice .', "Ellagic acid, although
    poorly absorbed and rapidly metabolized, was detected in human plasma after consumption
    of a single dose of 8 ounces of pomegranate juice or 1000 mg of PE dietary supplement
    with a maximum concentration of 0.06 \xB5M at 1 h postingestion .", 'In contrast,
    Cerda et al.', 'reported that ellagic acid was not detected in plasma or urine
    after daily intake of 1 L of pomegranate juice containing 4.37 g punicalagins
    over 5 d, but found three ellagitannin metabolites in plasma.', "The highest concentration
    of the sum of the three metabolites reached 18.6 \xB5M .", 'Also, Seeram et al.',
  "detected increasing concentrations of glucuronyl and sulfate conjugates of urolithin
    A and urolithin B in plasma samples between 0.5 and 6 h postingestion, with the
    highest concentration of urolithin A and urolithin B of 0.11 and 0.05 \xB5M, respectively.",
  "In the current study, we used 50 \xB5g/mL of PE that is equivalent to 18.4 \xB5M
    of punicalagins.", 'Because gut flora metabolites are not formed in cell culture,
    extrapolation of PE concentration in growth medium to human plasma is inaccurate
    per se.', 'Yet, the fact that ellagitannin metabolites were measured at micromolar
    concentrations in human plasma after ingestion of pomegranate juice  suggests
    that PE concentration used in this study is a physiologically relevant dose.',
  'However, the use of only one cancer cell line is a limitation of this study, which
    will be addressed in future studies.', 'In summary, our study suggests that PE
    targets a specific DNA repair pathway that is critical for cancer cell survival
    both spontaneously and after drug challenge.', This provides a strong rationale
    for further testing of PE as a nontoxic adjunct to the prevention of breast cancer
    recurrence through its actions on breast cancer cells., 'However, further research
    is needed to demonstrate these effects in animal studies and in tissue samples
    from women with breast cancer.', 'The authors would like to thank Dr. JoEllen
    Welsh, for critical reading of the manuscript, Judy Narvaez for help with flow
    cytometric analysis, David Frank and Marcy Kuentzel for excellent technical help
    with the microarray experiments.']
