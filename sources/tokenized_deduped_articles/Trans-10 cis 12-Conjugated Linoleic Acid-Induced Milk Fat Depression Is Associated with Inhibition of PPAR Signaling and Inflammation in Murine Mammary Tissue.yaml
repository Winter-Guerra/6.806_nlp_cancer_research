    were unable to cluster by gene due to the large size of the dataset; that is,
    there were no statistically significant genes in liver at the stringent cutoff
    used with mammary data.', There were 170 DEGs when the selection criteria were
    relaxed with 72 upregulated and 98 down-regulated., The CLA diet did not affect
    genes related to FA synthesis even though there was increase lipid accumulation
    in the liver., Some of the genes related to FA oxidation were down-regulated.,
  'Among the genes related to FA transport, CD36, Fabp1, and Fabp2 were upregulated
    while Fabp4 was down-regulated.', Feeding CLA increased liver mass and altered
    hepatic FA composition., The greater liver mass was due in part to lipid accumulation
    and was associated with several alterations in gene expression., 'For instance,

    analysis identified hepatic steatosis, abnormal Kupffer cell morphology, abnormal
    liver sinusoid morphology, abnormal mononuclear phagocyte, abnormal circulating

    glucose regulation of insulin, glyoxylate cycle, biosynthesis of unsaturated FA,
    alanine and aspartate metabolic pathway, erythrocytes differentiation pathway,

    effects of trans-10, cis-12-CLA on liver and mammary tissue, two predominantly
    lipid-synthesizing tissues in lactating mice.', 'In the mammary tissue, the reduction
    in milk lipid content was characterized by lower concentrations of de novo synthesized
    fatty acids as a consequence of inhibition of several genes related to lipid synthesis.',
  'Lipid metabolism was the main cellular function affected by trans-10, cis-12-CLA,
    and the large impact and inhibition of biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids
    KEGG pathway confirmed such effect.', 'The bioinformatics analyses underscored
    that a major effect of trans-10, cis-12-CLA on mammary tissue encompassed alterations
    in signaling pathways and phospholipid species biosynthesis.', 'Substantial regulation
    of milk lipid synthesis in lactating mice occurs at the mRNA level, and there
    is evidence suggesting that part of the pathway is regulated by SREBP1 .', The
    lower expression of Srebp1 and its downstream genes in previous studies provided
    evidence of its role in murine milk lipid synthesis., 'However, the effect of
    trans-10, cis-12-CLA on SREBP1 is indirect as FA cannot bind to this transcription
    factor .', "In contrast, FA are natural ligands of the nuclear receptor PPAR\u03B3
    which is known to regulate lipogenesis in some cell types .", "The overall inhibition
    of PPAR signaling KEGG pathway, the reduction in Ppar\u03B3expression and its
    downstream genes regulating FA uptake, FA synthesis, FA desaturation, and lipid
    droplet formation due to trans-10, cis-12-CLA, all support a role for PPAR\u03B3
    in murine mammary lipid metabolism.", "We have previously shown that activation
    of PPAR\u03B3 could upregulate mammary lipogenic gene networks in bovine mammary
    epithelial cells .", "CLA has also been shown to act as a PPAR\u03B3 activator
    in some cell types .", "However, an important consideration in the context of
    PPAR\u03B3 regulation of murine mammary lipid synthesis is the fact that the mammary
    gland of this species contains a substantial amount of adipocytes which may in
    fact be an important source of PPAR\u03B3 and also adipocytokine mRNA expression
    .", 'Glycosphingolipid biosynthesis-ganglio series was the most activated KEGG
    pathway in addition to being one of the most-impacted pathways by trans-10, cis-12-CLA.',
  Glycosphingolipids are key components of the apical plasma membrane and subcellular
    components including vesicles ., 'Glycosphingolipids are involved in molecular
    functions such as differentiation, apoptosis, and cell-cell interaction .', "In
    murine mammary tissue, ganglioside GD1\u03B1 is specifically increased during
    lactation and is highly concentrated in the milk fat globule membranes and helps
    prevent aggregation of milk fat globules .", 'We have previously observed a shift
    in the lipid globule distribution towards an increase in the number of smaller
    lipid droplets in the secreted milk as well as intracellular mammary epithelium
    in mice fed trans-10, cis-12-CLA , and this could be due to altered glycosphingolipid
    biosynthesis in addition to reduced lipogenesis.', Based on microarray data from
    murine mammary tissue Rudolph et al., suggested that gluconeogenesis per se is
    not an important function in murine mammary epithelium., 'However, the enzyme
    PCK1 which is a key component of this pathway in liver also is central for the
    generation of glycerol-phosphate for esterification during the process of glyceroneogenesis
    .', 'Thus, it is not surprising that the top most-impacted GO biological process
    due to dietary CLA was inhibition of negative regulation of gluconeogenesis; that
    is, supply of glucose to mammary gland might have been decreased with a consequent
    increase in use of other carbon sources to generate glycerol-phosphate.', 'In
    addition to its effects on lipid metabolism, in the IPA analysis trans-10, cis-12-CLA
    affected cellular processes related to cell cycle progression, cell-cell interactions,
    and cell assembly and organization.', These effects of CLA were probably through
    signaling pathways regulating ErbB receptors and the actin cytoskeleton., ErbB
    signaling was identified as one of the top 10 impacted KEGG pathways in our study.,
  'The ErbB signaling pathway in murine mammary gland is involved in the control of
    cell survival, cell-cell interaction and cellular differentiation, cell cycle
    progression, and morphogenesis .', 'Activation of the ErbB pathway is considered
    beneficial for cellular proliferation in damaged tissue ; thus, it could be possible
    that the activation of this pathway in our study was a compensatory response due
    to CLA.', Proliferation of mammary epithelium and ductal hyperplasia has also
    been observed in CLA-fed mice independent of alterations of ErbB expression .,
  Ovariectomized mice fed CLA experienced an estrogen-independent allosteric mammary
    growth characterized by ductal elongation due to enlarged proliferative terminal
    end buds ., 'In addition, CLA feeding was associated with increased incidence
    of tumor development and progression .', Regulation of actin-based motility by
    rho was one of the top 5 canonical pathways identified by IPA analysis., 'Dietary
    CLA upregulated expression of actin B and actin G, which play an important role
    in formation of stress fibers connecting extracellular matrix to the intracellular
    medium.', Profilin is involved in actin filament polymerization ., 'Rho proteins
    regulate Actb, Actg, and Pfn  and can affect actin polymerization which can actively
    drive vesicle movement in cells .', 'The ras homolog D, which is involved in endosomal
    dynamics and rearrangement of actin cytoskeleton, was also upregulated by CLA
    in this study.', RhoD is involved in the regulation of both membrane traffic and
    cytoskeleton in the cell ., Overexpression of RhoD induced remodeling of actin
    cytoskeleton accompanied by increased endosomal fission and scattering of vesicles
    in the cells ., 'Thus, our results suggested that CLA either directly or indirectly
    caused a substantial remodeling of cellular structures.', 'It could be possible
    that such effects were partly due to changes in unsaturated FA availability, for
    example, for cellular membrane formation.', 'Trans-10, cis-12-CLA causes marked
    dilation of endoplasmic reticulum in the mammary epithelial cells and upregulates
    x-box binding protein 1 expression.', 'In addition, CLA is also known to induce
    the ER stress response by increasing splicing of XBP1 mRNA and activation of c-Jun
    N-terminal kinase signaling .', 'In our study, a greater expression of Xbp1 and
    Jnk1, genes coding key proteins in the ER stress response, due to CLA suggested
    the induction of an unfolded protein response in the ER.', 'That idea is supported
    by the downregulation of calnexin, a molecular chaperone which mediates the proper
    folding of nascent proteins in ER, coupled with upregulation of BiP and HSP90AA1
    which bind to misfolded proteins.', 'Thus, the activation of UPR with CLA might
    have been associated with greater ER stress and underscored a marked derangement
    in posttranslational modification of proteins.', 'A key feature of the UPR is
    cellular inflammation , and the activation of cytotoxic T cell differentiation
    along with several acute-phase proteins in our study seems to confirm that CLA
    exerted a proinflammatory state in mammary cells.', 'In this context, the inhibition
    of golgi cis cisterna, beta-catenin destruction complex, and nuclear exosome could
    have been a response to ER stress and inflammation.', 'Figure 4: Acute-phase response

    mammary epithelial cells .', "Different mechanisms have been proposed for the
    induction of apoptosis by CLA: p53-dependent ; mitochondrial pathway targeting

    induction of CHOP, and the cleavage of caspase 12 .", 'In this study, in addition
    to the induction of ER stress response, a gene related with the mitochondrial
    pathway, for example, Bcl2, was also affected.', 'The Bcl protein decreases the
    activation of caspase 3 involved in apoptosis , and a mouse Bcl2-mutant strain
    has greater rates of apoptosis in cells .', 'The acute-phase response signaling
    was the major canonical pathway affected by trans-10, cis-12-CLA in the mammary
    tissue.', 'The top three upregulated genes Orm1, Cp, Saa2, in addition to C4b,

    genes Mup4, Mup2, and Rbp4 are well-established negative regulators of acute-phase
    proteins .', Acute-phase proteins are induced in response to tissue injury leading
    to robust inflammatory responses ., 'In addition to acute-phase proteins Defb,

    promote healing , and Sphk1 enhances proinflammatory cytokines .', 'The murine
    mammary tissue is characterized by an upregulation of acute-phase proteins during
    the initial phase of involution, but the exact role of such response has not been
    determined .', 'In our study, a proinflammatory effect induced by CLA on mammary
    tissue could have led to decreased milk synthesis capacity of the epithelial cells
    and a subsequent effect on the growth of pups nursing mice fed trans-10, cis-12-CLA
    .', 'The marked accumulation of 20:4n-6 in milk of CLA-fed mice might have played
    a role in the proinflammatory response observed, for example, by enhancing the
    production of oxidized lipid products .', 'The accumulation of 20:4n-6, however,
    contrasts with the marked decrease in its concentration in milk of lactating dairy
    cows receiving an exogenous infusion of CLA that reduced milk fat synthesis .',
  The acute-phase response proteins are closely regulated at the transcriptional level
    by STAT3 and NFkB ., ER stress can induce upregulation of acute-phase proteins
    through NFkB activation ., None of these transcriptional regulators was upregulated
    with CLA., 'However, there was upregulation of the proinflammatory cytokines IL6
    and TNF.', IL6 is known to exert its action through increasing STAT3 ., "During
    the acute-phase response, TNF decreases the expression of nuclear receptors PPAR\u03B3,
    PPAR\u03B1, RXR\u03B1, and LXR\u03B1  which in turn could affect the lipid-synthesizing
    transcriptome.", "In addition to its effects on lipid metabolism, PPAR\u03B3 dampens
    inflammation via transrepression of proinflammatory molecules .", "For instance,
    PPAR\u03B3 inhibits inflammation by direct interaction with AP1 and NFkB, thus,
    preventing their binding to response elements on inflammatory genes .", "Activation
    of PPAR\u03B3 by synthetic PPAR\u03B3 agonists reduces the expression of inflammatory
    cytokines and chemokines in bovine mammary epithelial cells .", "While FA are
    considered as natural ligands of PPAR\u03B3 , the lower PPAR\u03B3 expression
    and greater acute-phase protein expression, which confirmed the existence of a
    marked degree of inflammation, suggested that trans-10, cis-12-CLA antagonizes
    PPAR\u03B3.", "Further work is needed to determine if the ability of PPAR\u03B3
    to repress proinflammatory molecules is diminished due to its interaction with
    trans-10, cis-12-CLA.", Overt inflammation might reduce transcription of anti-inflammatory
    nuclear receptors leading to negative effects on cellular mechanisms including
    lipid synthesis and secretion., "In lactating mouse mammary tissue targeted deletion
    of Ppar\u03B3 resulted in greater concentration of proinflammatory lipids in milk
    leading to reduced pup growth and induction of inflammation.", "Those results
    highlighted the importance of PPAR\u03B3 signalling during lactation .", "Some
    of the effects of trans-10, cis-12-CLA in our study might have been regulated
    through its effects on PPAR\u03B3.", 'The effect of trans-10, cis-12-CLA on liver
    was dramatic as CLA caused accumulation of lipid in the span of four days.', The
    associated increase in liver mass due to TAG accumulation suggested induction
    of hepatic steatosis in CLA-fed animals., This was confirmed with the gene functional
    analysis as "hepatic steatosis" was one of the top terms associated with the "mouse
    phenotype" category., 'Primary biliary cirrhosis and liver cirrhosis were the
    top terms in the "disease" category suggesting that trans-10, cis-12-CLA feeding
    predisposed the mice to these conditions.', The onset of hepatic steatosis could
    predispose liver to inflammation and oxidative stress leading to steatohepatitis
    and eventually to liver cirrhosis ., 'The development of hepatic steatosis is
    specific for trans-10, cis-12-CLA feeding but not to other CLA isomers .', 'Hepatic
    steatosis has been previously reported in growing mice after 14 days of trans-10,
    cis-12-CLA feeding .', 'Potential mechanisms involved in the onset of hepatic
    steatosis due to trans-10, cis-12-CLA have been reviewed recently , but it is
    important to recognize that all those previous studies have been conducted with
    nonlactating animals.', The reduction in FA oxidation coupled with increased uptake
    of FA may be one of the reasons for hepatic lipid accumulation ., Decreased FA
    oxidation could lead to accumulation of intracellular diacylglycerol concentration
    which is implicated in hepatic insulin resistance through activation of protein
    kinase C ., 'In a recent study, CLA-induced hepatic steatosis was associated with
    an increase in diacylglycerol content and membrane associated protein kinase C  suggesting
    that CLA feeding could potentially lead to hepatic insulin resistance.', 'In this
    study, mitochondria, the primary organelle involved in FA oxidation, were the
    most-impacted cellular component followed by ER and peroxisomes.', Mitochondrial
    dysfunction causes hepatic steatosis and has been implicated in the progression
    from nonalcoholic fatty liver disease to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ., 'The
    top affected pathways, molecular functions, biological processes, and diseases
    are related to mitochondria further confirming that trans-10, cis-12-CLA feeding
    affected hepatic mitochondrial functions.', 'The ER was the second most affected
    cellular organelle in the liver of trans-10, cis-12-CLA-fed mice.', The activation
    of molecular functions such as chaperone binding and unfolded protein binding
    suggests induction of ER stress response in hepatic tissue., 'Induction of ER
    stress could further deteriorate the steatotic condition by augmenting hepatic
    lipogenesis via activating proteolytic cleavage of SREBP1 , decreasing hepatic
    secretion of TAG by reducing apoB secretion  and upregulation of Xbp1 .', 'The
    transcriptional regulator Xbp1, a known regulator of the unfolded protein response,
    regulates the expression of lipogenic genes Scd1, acetyl-CoA carboxylase beta,
    and diacylglycerol acetyltransferase 2, independent of SREBP1 and ChREBP .', 'Also,
    a shift in hepatic FA composition towards saturated FA disrupts ER homeostasis
    and promotes ER stress .', An increased ratio of saturated to unsaturated FA is
    considered as a secondary hit in the progression of steatosis to steatohepatitis
    ., 'Trans-10, cis-12-CLA-fed mice in our study had greater hepatic palmitate concentration
    thereby increasing the ratio of saturated FA.', 'Thus, those data confirm previous
    reports that the induction of ER stress could be caused in part by altered hepatic
    FA profile.', 'As indicated above, the presence of adipocytes in the mammary tissue
    used for transcriptomics is an important consideration when interpreting our data,
    particularly as it relates to PPAR and adipocytokine signaling.', Adipose tissue
    constitutes ca., 20% of the lactating murine mammary tissue in early lactation  and
    in rodents is indispensable for the normal function of the mammary epithelium
    ., It has been suggested that the gene expression changes in a complex tissue
    like rodent mammary could be a function of changes in the gene expression within
    a particular cell type or the proportion of the given cell type ., This could
    be an important factor during different stages of mammary function and development
    when the abundance of the two cell types varies substantially ., 'Our study was
    conducted during peak lactation when the adipose content is at its lowest, but
    further studies are needed to delineate more closely the impact of trans-10, cis-12-CLA
    on the relative abundance of mammary and adipose cell types in the rodent mammary
    gland during peak lactation.', During lactation the effect of CLA on the liver
    was similar to those observed previously in growing mice., 'The hepatic gene enrichment
    functional analysis revealed induction of hepatic steatosis, perturbations in
    the mitochondrial functions, and induction of ER stress.', 'The major effect of
    CLA on mammary tissue encompassed alterations in cellular signaling pathways,
    phospholipid species biosynthesis, and a marked degree of inflammation and ER
    stress.', Such responses might be associated with enhanced cellular apoptosis
    and precocious involution of the mammary gland., "Inhibition of PPAR\u03B3 signaling
    was associated with decreased milk fat synthesis and uncontrolled inflammation.",
