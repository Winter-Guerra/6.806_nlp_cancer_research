['Polyphenols including 3-glucoside/arabinoside/galactoside-based polymers of delphinidins,
    petunidins, peonidins, malvidins and cyanidins are one type of biological macromolecules,
    which are extraordinarily rich in blueberries.', Anti-inflammatory activity of
    blueberry polyphenols was investigated by using lipopolysaccharide induced RAW264.7
    macrophages., "The results showed that BPPs suppressed the gene expression of
    IL-1\xCE\xB2, IL-6 and IL-12p35.", "The inhibition effect on IL-1\xCE\xB2 and
    IL-6 mRNA was most obvious at the concentration of 10-200 \xCE\xBCg/mL BPPs.",
  But the inhibition effect on IL-12p35 mRNA was increased with the increasing concentration
    of BPPs., "When fixed at 100 \xCE\xBCg/mL BPPs, the most significant inhibition
    on IL-1\xCE\xB2, IL-6 and IL-12p35 mRNA expression was detected at 12-48 h. In
    conclusion, BPPs exhibit anti-inflammation activity by mediating and modulating
    the balances in pro-inflammatory cytokines of IL-1\xCE\xB2, IL-6, and IL-12."]
