['Two acetic acid bacteria, Acetobacter indonesiensis and Acetobacter syzygii, were
    isolated from Iranian traditional yogurt and curd, respectively, and were identified
    by using Basic Local Alignment Search Tool search of their amplified 16S rRNA
    gene sequences.', 'Several primary tests were conducted on isolated bacteria,
    including Gram staining, catalase assay, low pH and high bile salt concentration
    tolerance, antibacterial activity against pathogenic bacteria, and antibiotic
    susceptibility, to prove the probiotic properties of isolates.', 'Strain secretions
    were also used for cytotoxicity assessments on several cancer cell lines and a
    human normal cell line through 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
    bromide assay as well as qualitative and quantitative evaluations of apoptosis.',
  The results proved the acceptable probiotic characteristics of the isolated strains.,
  'A. syzygii secretions showed significant cytotoxicity against all cancer cell lines,
    whereas these secreted metabolites did not show cell toxicity on human normal
    cells.', 'In conclusion, the anticancer effect of A. syzygii strain secretions
    depends on the induction of apoptosis in cancer cells.', 'However, several investigations
    should be conducted to precisely determine the effective compounds to be used
    as anticancer therapeutics in the future.']
