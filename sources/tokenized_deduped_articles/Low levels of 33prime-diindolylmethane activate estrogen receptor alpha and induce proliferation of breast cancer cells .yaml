    to play a role in its promotion ., "Initiation of breast cancer by 17\u03B2-estradiol
    can involve the formation of DNA damage via its oxidation products.", 'Accordingly,

    experiment under the same conditions but with MDAMB-232 cells, which do not express
    the ER\u03B1.", "As expected, DIM has no significant effect on cell growth in
    this cell line, confirming that the proliferative effect of DIM is a result of
    activating the ER\u03B1 pathway.", "In conclusion, we observed that treatment
    with the low concentration of DIM induced breast cancer cell proliferation in
    the absence of E2, an effect mediated by ER\u03B1 and the PKA signaling pathway.",
  'Additional file 6: Figure S6.', "FACS analysis of cells treated with either 10
    or 50 \u03BCM DIM.", T47D or MDAMB-231 cells., Bar plot shows the percentage of
    S-phase cells in each sample., "Bidirectional inhibitory crosstalk between AhR
    and ER\u03B1 is very complex and occurs at many regulatory levels .", 'AhR ligands
    have been shown to carry potentially important chemopreventive properties, thus
    understanding the mechanisms behind these properties is fundamental for developing
    cancer therapies.', 'DIM has been intensely studied as a possible therapeutic
    agent in cancer treatment, especially for breast cancer.', 'Studies report that
    DIM treatment promotes cellular growth arrest of cancer cells, as well as a decrease
    in mammary tumor formation in DMBA-treated rats .', 'Although the use of DIM as
    a therapeutic agent in the treatment of breast cancer is not yet approved, there
    are active clinical trials that are testing DIM for the treatment of many types
    of cancers.', 'However, DIM can easily be purchased as a dietary supplement and
    be self-administered.', 'As previously mentioned, DIM is a SAhRM that binds AhR,
    which is involved in the regulation of the expression of phase I and II drug metabolizing
    enzymes.', 'Discrepancies are found in the literature as to whether DIM is an
    agonist or an antagonist of AhR , thus, clarification of this issue is important,
    especially regarding the potentially toxic effect mediated by AhR agonists in
    the liver following AhR activation.', 'In this study, we tested how the use of
    different concentrations of DIM can lead to opposite biological outcomes.', "As
    previously reported, we confirmed that activation of ER\u03B1 by E2 represses
    the induction of CYP1A1 by approximately 60% after TCDD treatment.", "The simultaneous
    activation of AhR and ER\u03B1 when cells are treated with DIM does not allow
    full induction of CYP1A1.", "Furthermore, addition of E2 to DIM-treated cells
    has no repressive effect on CYP1A1 expression, which can be explained by the fact
    that ER\u03B1 is already fully recruited to the CYP1A1 promoter after DIM treatment
    alone.", "We propose that activation of ER\u03B1 by DIM can explain, at least
    in part, some discrepancies found in the literature on the role of DIM as an agonist/antagonist
    of AhR in ER\u03B1 positive cell lines .", DIM concentrations found in the human
    body are dependent on the diet., "Our first experiments were carried out using
    a concentration of 50 \u03BCM, which is probably much higher than what can realistically
    be reached in the body .", "We then compared 50 \u03BCM DIM with a more physiological
    concentration of DIM and observed that the high concentration of the compound
    induces the expression of AhR target genes, while the low concentration shows
    significant effects on the expression of ER\u03B1 target genes in the absence
    of E2.", 'These observations indicate that at physiological concentrations, DIM
    principally mediates estrogenic effects.', It can also explain why oral administration
    of DIM in rodents has no hepatic toxicity due to the weak induction of the CYP1A1
    gene at this low concentration., "ER\u03B1 activation can be mediated by direct
    binding of its main ligand, but it can also be induced by the activation of the
    PKA signaling pathway.", "The phosphorylation of ER\u03B1 increases its capacity
    to interact with the transcription machinery and triggers the expression of ER\u03B1
    target genes .", "Accordingly, we were able to demonstrate that the effect of
    DIM treatment on CYP1A1 and GREB1 expression is mediated by ER\u03B1, which, in
    this case, is activated mostly by the PKA signaling pathway.", The estrogen receptor
    is highly expressed in almost 70% of breast cancer cases and its activation promotes
    cellular proliferation and tumor development ., 'Our results demonstrate that
    DIM, at concentrations likely attainable by a diet rich in cruciferous vegetables,
    induces proliferation of MCF7 and T47D breast cancer cells in the absence of E2.',
  "DIM requires that ER\u03B1 be activated by the PKA signaling pathway to promote
    cellular growth in the absence of E2.", "Consequently, the abundance of ER\u03B1,
    as well as circulating estrogen levels, will influence the local effects of DIM
    on cell growth.", 'Altogether, our findings suggest that the use of DIM as a dietary
    supplement or as a therapeutic agent should be undertaken very cautiously as unexpected
    adverse effects could be encountered.', 'MM, LL, IB, CC, and BG performed the
    experiments.', LG and MM conceived the experiments and wrote the manuscript.,
