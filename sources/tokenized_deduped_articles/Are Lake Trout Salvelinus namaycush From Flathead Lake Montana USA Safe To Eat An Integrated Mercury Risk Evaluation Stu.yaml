['This study focused on evaluating the appropriateness of the State of Montana consumption
    guidelines for Lake Trout from Flathead Lake, Montana, USA.', This lake is jointly
    managed by the State and the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes., Thousands
    of lake trout are harvested by the Tribes and donated to local food banks yearly.,
  'Samples from forty-eight lake trout were analyzed for mercury, selenium and polyunsaturated
    fatty acids.', "Models that seek to quantify the moderating or attenuating effects
    of both selenium and omega-3 PUFAs on mercury toxicity were integrated with the
    US Environmental Protection Agency methods for setting consumption guidelines
    in an attempt to better determine \u201Csafe\u201D consumption recommendations.",
  Omega-3 PUFAs benefits were balanced with mercury detriment to yield a potential
    net health risk/benefit., 'Consumption of lake trout, of any size, failed to show
    any predicted neurodevelopmental benefits.', 'However, small cardiovascular benefits
    were predicted for shorter fish.', Selenium levels were not limiting., 'Data from
    this study indicates the State consumption guidelines may not be adequately protective
    for the general public, and new guidelines have been proposed.', 'Separate, more
    conservative guidelines may be considered for the food bank users pending the
    outcome of an upcoming study.']
