['Background: The level of evidence regarding the association between red and processed
    meat intakes and breast cancer risk is still low, due to insufficient prospective
    studies.', 'Moreover, mechanistic data suggest that some antioxidants may modulate
    this relationship but epidemiological evidence is lacking.', 'Our objectives were
    to investigate relationships between red and processed meat intakes and breast
    cancer risk, and to study whether an antioxidant supplementation modulates these
    associations, which, to our knowledge, has never been investigated before.']
