[Diallyl disulfide is one of the major volatile components of garlic oil., 'DADS has
    various biological properties, including anticancer, antiangiogenic, and antioxidant

    interests:  The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.', Breast
    cancer is the most common malignancy with the highest incidence rates among women
    worldwide., Poor response to chemotherapy remains a major clinical obstacle to
    the successful treatment of breast cancer ., 'Therefore, the research community
    must acquire a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the
    development of breast cancer to identify more effective drugs leading to better
    treatment for breast cancer patients.', 'Diallyl disulfide, one of the major organosulfur
    compounds in garlic, is recognized as part of a group of potential chemopreventive
    compounds .', "In the last few years, more and more studies have demonstrated
    that DADS has anti-tumor activity in many types of tumor cells, including neuroblastoma
    , breast cancer \u2013, colon cancer , lung cancer  and gastric cancer cell lines
    , .", 'The mechanisms underlying this anticancer action of DADS include the activation
    of metabolizing enzymes that detoxify carcinogens, the suppression of DNA adduct
    formation, the inhibition of reactive oxygen species production, the regulation
    of cell cycle arrest and the induction of apoptosis .', 'However, the mechanism
    of the anti-tumor effect of DADS in breast cancer is not yet well understood.',
  "MicroRNAs are a class of small non-coding RNAs that play vital roles in gene expression
    by binding to the 3\u2032-untranslated region of target mRNAs, leading to mRNA
    cleavage or translational repression .", 'MicroRNAs regulate the expression of
    a wide variety of target genes and are therefore involved in a broad range of
    biological processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis
    , .', 'Mounting evidence has shown that miRNAs are dysregulated in breast cancer
    and might serve as oncogenes or tumor suppressors during tumorigenesis , .', 'Here
    we focus on miR-34a, which represents a promising topic in cancer research .',
  "Previous studies have shown that the transcription of miR-34a is under the control
    of the tumor suppressor gene product p53 and that it acts as a tumor suppressor,
    inducing cell cycle arrest in G1 phase \u2013, senescence and apoptosis ,  in
    several types of cancer, including breast cancer.", The miR-34a expression level
    is closely related to the occurrence and progression of breast cancer ., 'In our
    previous study, we found that the level of miR-34a in MGC-803 cells was up-regulated
    more than 2-fold after DADS treatment compared with the DMSO control .', 'Therefore,
    we suggest that miR-34a may play a vital role in the anticancer action of DADS.',
  The aim of this study was to explore the mechanisms underlying the antitumor effect
    of DADS in breast cancer., miR-34a may indeed enhance the antitumor effects of
    diallyl disulfide., 'Furthermore, SRC was shown to be a target of miR-34a.', 'Thus,
    we demonstrated that DADS suppresses SRC/Ras/ERK signaling-mediated proliferation
    and metastasis in human breast cancer through the up-regulation of miR-34a.',
  'To examine whether DADS affects breast cancer cells, duration and dose-effect experiments
    were performed on human breast cancer cells and a normal mammary epithelial cell
    line.', The results showed that DADS inhibited the proliferation of MDA-MB-231
    cells in a duration- and dose-concentration manner compared with the control.,
  DADS did not inhibit the proliferation of MCF-10A cells., Wound-healing and Transwell
    assays were used to assess the impact of DADS on MDA-MB-231 cell migration and
    invasion., Both migration and invasion were significantly inhibited upon exposure
    to different concentrations of DADS., Figure 1., DADS inhibits the proliferation
    and invasion of breast cancer cells in vitro., "(A\u2013B) MDA-MB-231 and MCF-10A

    transfected with a scramble miRNA control, miR-34a mimics or miR-34a plus 200

    mimics could inhibit MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation.", "The anti-proliferation
    effect was more obvious when the MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with miR-34a
    and treated with 200 \xB5M DADS.", The Transwell assay results showed that the
    combined treatment of miR-34a mimics with DADS synergistically inhibited breast
    cancer cell invasion., Figure 2., DADS inhibits growth and invasion by up-regulating

    the in vitro studies, we hypothesized that miR-34a might repress breast cancer
    growth and enhance the antitumor effect of DADS in vivo.", 'To address this critical
    question, we used an in vivo xenograft model.', 'First, to determine whether DADS
    has therapeutic effects, MDA-MB-231 cells were subcutaneously injected into nude
    mice, and the tumors thereby generated were treated with DADS or mock.', Tumor
    volumes were measured every 4 days., 'After 28 days, the mice were euthanized,
    and the xenografts were removed.', The mean volume and weight of the tumors generated
    from the DADS group were significantly lower compared with the control group.,
  'Next, to explore whether miR-34a can enhance the effect of DADS, the mice were
    sorted into four different treatment groups: scramble, miR-34a, mock, and DADS
    plus miR-34a.', 'Compared with the scramble negative control-treated mice, treatment
    with miR-34a led to a reduced tumor volume.', 'Furthermore, mice treated with
    DADS plus miR-34a had lower tumor volumes compared with the mock treatment group.',
  The same differences were observed for tumor weight., These results collectively
    suggest that miR-34a may enhance the antitumor effect of DADS., Figure 3.  miR-34a
    enhances the antitumor effect of DADS in in mouse xenograft models., (A) MDA-MB-231

    the SRC gene, among a number of others, may be a potential miR-34a target.', "We
    chose SRC for further analysis because it was predicted by online software and
    also previously implicated in promoting breast cancer progression \u2013.", Damiano  reported
    that SRC regulates the proliferation and motility of cancer cells by affecting
    the Ras/ERK signaling pathway., 'To confirm that miR-34a directly targets SRC,
    we performed luciferase reporter assays.', "The full-length SRC 3\u2032UTR was
    cloned downstream of the firefly luciferase gene and co-transfected with miR-34a
    mimics or scrambled oligonucleotides.", Luciferase activity was measured 48 h
    after transfection., "We found that co-transfection of miR-34a and the wild-type
    SRC 3\u2032UTR caused a significant decrease in luciferase expression compared
    with controls.", "However, co-transfection of miR-34a with the mutant SRC 3\u2032UTR
    did not cause a decrease in luciferase expression.", These results suggest that
    miR-34a can directly target SRC., 'To determine the level at which miR-34a influences
    SRC expression, we examined the expression of SRC mRNA after transfection with
    miR-34a mimics or scrambled oligonucleotides.', As shown in Fig., '4C, after transfection
    with miR-34a mimics, the expression of SRC mRNA was significantly lower than in
    the controls.', "(A) Schematic of the predicted miR-34a site in the 3\u2032UTR

    blot analyses to determine whether miR-34a mediates its anti-tumorigenic effects
    on breast cancer through the SRC/Ras/ERK signaling pathway.', 'First, we validated
    the effect of SRC activity on the Ras/ERK pathway in MDA-MB-231 cells.', 'Based
    on previous reports , knockdown of SRC by siRNA-mediated RNA interference resulted
    in decreased SRC mRNA and protein levels, which led to decreased Ras-GTP and phosphorylated-ERK1/2.',
  'Overexpression of SRC resulted in increased SRC mRNA and protein levels, leading
    to increased Ras-GTP and phosphorylated-ERK1/2.', We next investigated whether
    miR-34a induction would mimic the SRC reduction in suppressing the Ras/ERK signaling
    pathway., 'As anticipated, overexpression of miR-34a in MDA-MB-231 cells down-regulated
    SRC protein levels and resulted in less active Ras-GTP, leading to less phosphorylated
    ERK1/2.', The same changes were observed in the DADS group., 'These results suggest
    that Ras/ERK, as the signaling pathway downstream of SRC, may be tightly controlled
    by the miR-34a/SRC regulatory pathway.', Breast cancer is a group of heterogeneous
    diseases that show substantial variation in their molecular and clinical characteristics
    ., The use of traditional chemotherapeutic agents for breast cancer management
    often suffers from toxicity and resistance concerns., 'This emphasizes the need
    for the development of safer, natural, non-toxic compounds as chemotherapeutic/chemopreventive
    agents.', "In this study, we focused on DADS, the major organosulfur compound
    in garlic oil, which is known to lower the development of various cancers both
    in vitro and in vivo \u2013.", 'Over the past decade, the field of miRNA biology
    and their involvement in cancer have seen tremendous advances.', miRNAs represent
    potential disease biomarkers and novel therapeutic targets., 'In breast cancer,
    several large-scale profiling studies have described altered miRNA expression
    patterns ,  that vary with tumor type and the molecular pathways involved.', 'In
    our previous report, we found that the anti-cancer effects of DADS may be related
    to miRNAs.', 'In MGC-803 gastric cancer cells, seven miRNAs were up-regulated,
    and five miRNAs were down-regulated after DADS treatment compared with the DMSO
    control .', 'In this report, we show for the first time that DADS directly induces
    a tumor-suppressive miRNA, miR-34a, in breast cancer cells.', 'miR-34a has been
    reported to act as a tumor-suppressive miRNA in many cancer types , , and miR-34a
    expression is down-regulated in various cancer cell lines.', DADS inhibited the
    proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells in a time- and concentration-dependent manner
    compared with controls., 'Furthermore, migration and invasion were both significantly
    inhibited after exposure of MDA-MB-231 cells to different concentrations of DADS.',
  We then used an in vivo mouse xenograft model to further test these important in
    vitro findings., As shown in Fig., '3A-D, DADS inhibited breast cancer growth
    by up-regulating miR-34a expression.', 'To determine the molecular mechanisms
    underlying these actions, we further investigated the possible signaling pathways
    regulated by miR-34a.', We performed an online search of miR-34a targets using
    Targetscan., 'Among the hundreds of putative miRNA targets, we focused on Src,
    which regulates key cellular processes, including proliferation, survival, adhesion
    and motility.', Our hypothesis that miR-34a regulates Src was confirmed by luciferase
    reporter assays., SRC mRNA and protein levels were much lower in MDA-MB-231 cells
    transfected with miR-34a mimics relative to controls., 'In previous reports, Src
    was shown to channel signals through Ras/Raf/extracellular signal-regulated kinase
    1/2.', 'Elevated Src kinase activity has been reported in a wide range of human
    tumors, with Src activity increasing with disease progression , .', 'We further
    performed Western blot analysis of the protein levels of SRC, Ras-GTP, total Ras,
    phosphorylated ERK1/2, and ERK1/2 in MDA-MB-231 cells mock-treated or exposed
    to DADS and transfected with control or SRC siRNA, a control or SRC vector, or
    scramble or miR-34a mimics.', The results demonstrated that Ras/ERK signaling
    is also regulated by miR-34a/SRC and show that altering miR-34a levels may represent
    a new possible target for regulating Ras/ERK activity in breast cancer., Inhibition
    of the SRC/Ras/ERK signaling pathway via miR-34a targeting SRC might enhance the
    anti-cancer effects of DADS in breast cancer cells., 'Taken together, this study
    demonstrates that miR-34a may be required for the anti-cancer effects of DADS,
    both in human breast cancer cell lines and in xenograft models.', 'Furthermore,
    SRC may be a critical target of miR-34a.', 'DADS may therefore suppress proliferation
    and invasion in human breast cancer cells by up-regulating miR-34a and consequently
    reducing SRC/Ras/ERK signaling, indicating that miR-34a may serve as a potential
    gene therapy target for enhancing the antitumor effects of DADS in breast cancer
    therapy.', 'The following cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture
