['In previous studies we observed that rhein lysinate, a salt of rhein and lysine
    that is easily dissolved in water, inhibited the growth of tumor cells in breast
    cancer, ovarian cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma and cervical cancer.', "The present
    study aimed to investigate the effects of RHL on H460 and A549 non\u2011small
    cell lung cancer cells using a combination of RHL and Taxol.", "A 3\u2011(4,5\u2011dimethylthiazol\u20112\u2011yl)\u20112,5\u2011diphenyl\u2011tetrazolium

    in the H460 and A549 cells.", "Cell apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry combined
    with fluorescein\u2011isothiocyanate\u2011Annexin \u2164/propidium iodide staining.",
  The expression levels of proteins were detected by western blotting., There was
    a significant reduction in the proliferation of the NSCLC cell lines treated with
    a combination of Taxol and RHL., The overall growth inhibition was directly correlated
    with apoptotic cell death., "RHL potentiated Taxol\u2011induced cell killing by
    reducing extracellular signal\u2011regulated kinase activity and increasing the
    levels of cleaved poly(ADP\u2011ribose) polymerase and caspase\u20113.", "Notably,
    the results for the Bcl\u20112 and NF\u2011\u03BAB proteins also showed downregulation
    in the combined treatment group compared with the single\u2011agent treatment
    and the untreated control groups.", The present results showed that RHL potentiates
    the growth inhibition induced by Taxol in NSCLC cells and shoes that this synergy
    may be associated with the downregulation of ERK activation., 'Lung cancer is
    one of the most harmful malignant tumors to human health and life and its incidence
    is increasing every year, ranking first in large- and medium-sized cities in the
    incidence of malignant tumors.', Two-thirds of patients are in the advanced stage
    when diagnosed with lung cancer and lose the opportunity for surgical treatment.,
  Non-small cell lung cancer comprises 80% of all lung cancers., Chemotherapy is primarily
    used for the treatment of advanced lung cancer., 'Although new anticancer drugs
    and chemotherapies have been introduced, the outcomes for certain patients are
    not always satisfactory and patients become less able to tolerate treatment as
    the chemotherapy extends.', 'Therefore, targeted therapy for lung cancer has become
    a research hotspot in recent years.', 'Erlotinib and gefitinib are widely used
    in lung cancer therapy, although they are only effective for specific pathological
    situations and patients; the outcomes for the rest of the patients remain unsatisfactory.',
  The issue of subsequent resistance to chemotherapy and the mechanisms involved have
    yet to be elucidated., Novel treatment strategies targeting this aggressive disease
    are expected to offer long-term disease control or possibly even a cure., 'Rhein,
    one of the major bioactive constituents of the rhizome of rhubarb, inhibits the
    proliferation of various human cancer cells.', 'Our previous studies showed that
    rhein lysinate, a salt of rhein and lysine that is easily dissolved in water,
    exhibits anticancer activity in breast cancer, ovarian cancer, hepatocellular
    carcinoma and cervical cancer in vivo and in vitro.', We previously showed that
    RHL was highly active in targeting the MEK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase
    signal pathway and induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in human ovarian cancer
    cells., The present study aimed to determine whether RHL has additive or synergistic
    effects with Taxol and to determine the molecular mechanisms by which RHL enhances
    Taxol-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis., 'Rhein was purchased from Nanjing Qingze
    Medicine Ltd.,, while lysine was purchased from Beijing Solarbio Science and Technology
    Co.. RHL was made in our department.', 'The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium

    with 2,500 cells/well.', "Subsequent to overnight incubation, triplicate wells
    were treated with various concentrations of RHL for 48 h. Next, 20 \u03BCl MTT
    solutions were added to each well and incubated for 4 h at 37\xB0C.", "The MTT

    resuspended in 200 \u03BCl binding buffer, then 10 \u03BCl FITC-labeled enhanced
    Annexin V and 100 ng propidium iodide were added.", "Upon incubation in the dark
    for 15 min at room temperature or 30 min at 4\xB0C, the samples were diluted with
    300 \u03BCl binding buffer.", Flow cytometry was performed on a FACScan instrument
    and the data were processed using WinMDI/PC-software., The cells were harvested
    and washed with PBS solution., 'The whole cellular extracts were prepared by incubating
    the cells on ice in lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM
    EDTA, 2 mM EGTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, protease inhibitors
    and phosphatase inhibitors.', 'The supernatant was collected through centrifugation
    at 12,000 x g for 12 min.', Protein concentrations were determined with the Bradford
    protein assay., Equal amounts of lysate were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred
    to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane., "The membranes were blocked in TBST containing
    5% skim med milk at room temperature for 2 h and probed with primary antibodies
    overnight at 4\xB0C.", The membranes were then blotted with an appropriate horseradish
    peroxidase-linked secondary antibody., Proteins were visualized using enhanced
    chemiluminescence western blotting detection reagents., 'The growth of the H460
    and A549 cells treated with RHL, Taxol or a combination of the two was determined
    via MTT assays.', The dose used in the present study was selected based upon a
    preliminary dose escalation study., A significant reduction in growth was observed
    in the cells treated with RHL and Taxol in combination compared with treatment
    with RHL or Taxol alone., 'The combined drug intoxication value was ;0.7, indicating
    that the two drugs have a synergistic effect.', 'The induction of apoptosis was
    observed in the lung cancer cells treated with either Taxol, RHL or a combination
    of the two.', 'Relative to the single agents, the combined treatment induced more
    apoptosis in the two cell lines, as shown by flow cytometry combined with FITC-Annexin
    V/PI staining.', 'The ratios of apoptosis were 52.31 and 52.51% in the combined
    treatment groups, whereas the ratios of the Taxol groups were 18.98 and 18.86%
    in the H460 and A549 cells, respectively.', 'These results were consistent with
    the cell growth inhibition experiments using MTT, suggesting that the loss of
    viable cells due to RHL and Taxol treatment is partly due to the induction of
    an apoptotic cell death mechanism.', 'In an attempt to investigate the mechanism
    of the enhanced apoptotic process induced by the treatment of the cells with RHL
    and Taxol, the levels of caspase-3 and PARP were assessed in the H460 and A549
    cells.', The results showed that the combined treatment was able to increase the
    levels of cleaved PARP and caspase-3 significantly., "The results for the anti-apoptotic
    Bcl-2 and NF-\u03BAB proteins also showed downregulation in the combination group
    relative to the single-agent treatments and untreated control.", 'In the present
    study, it was observed that Taxol treatment enhanced the activation of ERK in
    the H460 and A5449 cells.', 'However, Taxol in combination with RHL prevented
    the Taxol-induced ERK activation through the inhibition of MEK phosphorylation.',
  Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide despite
    advances in the field of cancer therapeutics., 'Traditional treatment with empirically
    selected cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents has provided small, but real survival
    benefits.', 'Moreover, cancer recurrence and subsequent resistance to chemotherapy
    remain problematic and the mechanisms are not clear.', New agents are required
    to offer long-term disease control or even possibly a cure., 'Advances and insights
    into the molecular pathogenesis of lung cancers have provided certain novel molecular
    targets, offering new strategies and agents that are tumor specific.', Certain
    studies have demonstrated that tumor cells are able to produce resistance to Taxol
    by activating the MEK/ERK signal pathway., The activation of ERK was demonstrated
    to be important in mediating proliferation in cancer cells., Inhibiting MEK/ERK
    signaling may therefore enhance Taxol-induced cytotoxicity in lung cancer cells.,
  'Rhein, one of the major bioactive constituents of the rhizome of rhubarb, inhibits
    the proliferation of various human cancer cells.', 'We previously demonstrated
    that RHL, a salt of rhein and lysine that is easily dissolved in water, has anticancer
    activity in breast cancer, ovarian cancer, cervical cancer and hepatocellular
    carcinoma in vivo and in vitro.', We also showed that RHL was highly active in
    targeting the MEK/ERK signal pathway and that it induced apoptosis and cell cycle
    arrest in human ovarian cancer cells., 'In the present study, it was observed
    that RHL improved the anti-tumor activity of Taxol in lung cancer.', 'Mechanically,
    RHL potentiated Taxol-induced cell killing by reducing the phosphorylation of
    ERK and increasing the levels of cleaved caspase-3 and PARP.', These caspases
    belong to a family of cysteine proteases whose activation induces cellular apoptosis.,
  'Specifically, proteolytically cleaved caspase-3 and caspase-7, the active forms
    of pro-caspase-3 and pro-caspase-7, are key molecules for identifying the activation
    of apoptosis.', 'In addition, PARP is one of the main substrates of activated
    caspase pathways and a well-established indicator of apoptotic cell death.', "The
    results for the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and NF-\u03BAB proteins also showed downregulation
    in the combined treatment group compared with the signal-agent treatment and untreated
    control groups.", It is known that members of the Bcl-2 protein family act as
    key regulators of cellular apoptosis and are important determinants of cellular
    sensitivity or resistance to chemotherapy drugs., 'The overexpression of Bcl-2,
    an anti-apoptosis member of this family, is commonly observed in human lung cancer
    and Bcl-2 overexpression correlates with chemoresistance in this disease.', "In
    addition, NF-\u03BAB has been shown to inhibit apoptosis in response to chemotherapeutic
    agents.", "Compounds targeting the NF-\u03BAB pathway are able to sensitize lung
    tumor cells by counteracting resistance mechanisms, and therefore, deserve further
    evaluation with regard to chemotherapy and the possible chemoprevention of lung
    cancer.", 'In conclusion, the present findings showed a synergistic effect between
    RHL and Taxol in certain lung cancer cell lines.', This synergy is likely to be
    associated with the downregulation of ERK activation., 'Accordingly, further mechanistic
    studies may be useful in the treatment of patients with lung carcinoma.', This
    study was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of
    China and the General Program of Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province
    of China.]
