[Water-extractable and alkali-extractable polysaccharides from the seed of adzuki
    beans and their three polysaccharide sub-fractions were isolated and purified
    by anion-exchange and gel filtration chromatography., 'AWP-1 and AWP-2 were composed
    of Rha, Ara, Man, Gal and Glu.', 'AAP-1 was composed of Rha, Ara, Man, Gal and
    GalA.', The antioxidant and immunoregulatory activities of the polysaccharides
    were evaluated., 'The results indicated that AWP-1, AWP-2, and AAP-1 had significant
    antioxidant and immunoregulatory activities.', 'The results suggest that AWP-1,
    AWP-2, and AAP-1 have therapeutic implications in the treatment of inflammation
    and inflammatory-related disease.']
