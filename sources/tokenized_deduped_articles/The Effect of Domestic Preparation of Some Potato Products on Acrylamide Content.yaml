['The influence that food heating has on the concentration of acrylamide in home-cooked
    potato dishes prepared by high-temperature, such as pan-frying, deep-frying, roasting
    and microwave heating was analyzed.', The experiment was performed with commercially
    available deep-frozen par-fried French fries and deep-frozen par-fried potato
    products other than French fries., Acrylamide was found in all deep-frozen par-fried
    French fries and other deep-frozen par-fried potato products before domestic preparation.,
  "The mean level of acrylamide content in all frozen potato products before preparation
    was found to be 322 \u03BCg/kg.", "Potato products were then prepared at 180 \xB0C
    for 3 min and at 220 \xB0C for 10 min.", After domestic preparation it was found
    that the level of acrylamide in all products increased., Acrylamide content in
    the analyzed samples significantly increased as the temperature and time of processing
    increased., The statistical analysis showed significant differences for acrylamide
    content as a function of food preparation., The level of acrylamide increased
    with the increased heating temperature and heating time., 'Additionally, the preparation
    method of roasting was significantly lower in acrylamide content than the preparation
    method of microwaving although both preparation methods used the same conditions.',
  'These results suggest that microwaving might be more favourable to the formation
    of acrylamide than conventional heating methods, such as roasting.', Acrylamide
    is a probable human carcinogen molecule., 'In 1994, the International Agency for
    Research on Cancer classified industrial chemical acrylamide as a probable human
    carcinogen based on its carcinogenic action in rodents .', It is also a well-known
    neurotoxin ., 'In 2002, acrylamide was detected at high concentrations in heat-processed
    foods.', 'During heating the Maillard reaction takes place, affording food attractive
    sensory properties.', 'However, various hazardous compounds formed at the same
    time, such as acrylamide.', "It is a fact that acrylamide can form during intense
    heat treatments as a consequence of Maillard\u2013type reactions between free
    amino acids, particularly asparagine and reducing sugars such as glucose and fructose.",
  "Maximum limits for acrylamide in food have not been established, although the WHO
    guideline for acrylamide in drinking water is 0.5 \u03BCg/kg .", 'In the meantime,
    scientists have identified different factors affecting the formation of acrylamide
    in food.', 'It can be assumed that processing and food preparation, as well as
    the raw materials used can cause the formation of acrylamide.', "As acrylamide
    has not been detected in unheated or boiled foods, it is considered to be formed
    during heating at high temperatures above 120 \xB0C.", This fact has been attributed
    to the higher temperatures reached in Maillard reactions required for acrylamide
    formation., The Maillard reaction takes place during frying and roasting., It
    has been shown that the type and conditions of preparation of food have an important
    influence on the content of acrylamide., The literature suggests that there may
    be ways to reduce or prevent acrylamide formation by changing the production and
    preparation methods for commercially manufactured and domestic food., 'This may
    also occur during cooking in households, restaurants and catering enterprises.',
  Modifying the cooking process may be able to reduce the amount of acrylamide in
    food ., "Acrylamide has been detected in French fries, potato chips, crisps, bread,
    crisp bread, breakfast cereal, cookies, biscuits, crackers, roasted coffee and
    other products at levels up to 2,000 \u03BCg/kg.", 'Highly-strongly heated potato
    products such as French fries, potato chips, crisps and hash browns have been
    found to be major contributors of acrylamide in the diet.', "With a yearly worldwide
    production of about 330 million tons, the potato represents one of the world\u2019s
    major staple food crops.", 'Deep-frying is one of the most popular food preparation
    methods, both industrially and at home .', 'The purpose of the study was to examine
    the concentration of acrylamide in home-cooked potato dishes prepared by high-temperature
    cooking, such as pan-frying, deep-frying, roasting and microwave heating.', The
    experiment was performed with commercially available deep-frozen par-fried French
    fries before final domestic preparation., Three variants and four deep-frozen
    par-fried potato products other than French fries were obtained from a local retailer.,
  'Directly after purchasing, all the different types of potato products were prepared
    by pan-frying, deep-frying, roasting and microwaving.', Fresh sunflower oil was
    used in all experiments., The deep-frying of all potato products was performed
    in a domestic scale fryer., 200 g portions of products were fried in hot oil.,
  Oil temperature during frying was monitored by immersing a thermocouple in the fryer.,
  Pan-frying was performed in saucepan using 100 g portions of par-fried products
    fried in 100 ml of hot oil., The roasting of potato products was performed in
    a domestic oven., Microwaving was conducted in a domestic microwave oven., "The
    temperature and operating power of the microwave were set at 220 \xB0C at 700
    W for 10 min.", The temperature and heating time of the heating medium in all
    domestic appliances were measured during the treatments., The measurements were
    performed using an automatic temperature control system for domestic appliances.,
  "Finally, the products were cooled to 20 \xB0C at room temperature for about 30
    min.", "All samples were ground in a blender and stored at 4 \xB0C before analysis.",
  Table 1 shows the main characteristics of these potato products used in this study.,
  The average composition of potato products as reported in the respective labels
    is shown in Table 1., The dry mater contents of products were determined according
    to an official AOAC method ., "Briefly, 5 g of homogenized products were mixed
    with calcined sea sand and placed in an oven at 105 \xB0C until a constant weight
    was obtained.", "The acrylamide contents in the samples were determined by RP
    \u2014 HPLC methods with minor changes .", "The analyses were performed using
    Shimadzu LC-20AD series for HPLC equipped with a UV \u2014 Vis 190 \u2014 600
    nm diode array detector set at 200 nm, a vacuum degasser, binary pumps, a thermostated
    autosampler and a temperature\u2013controlled column oven.", "The column used
    was a C18, 4.0 mm guard column and a Synergi 4 \u03BC Hydro-RP 80 A 250 \xD7 4.6
    mm LC column from Phenomenex.", "The operating conditions were as follows: the
    mobile phase was an isocratic mixture of 5 mM heptasulfonic; flow rate, 1.0 ml/min;
    injection volume, 100 \u03BCl; column temperature 25 \xB0C; autosampler temperature,
    4 \xB0C.", "Acrylamide elutes near 8\u20139 min.", The total time from one injection
    to the next injection was 30 min., 'Peak identification was based on the retention
    time, by comparison of the ratio of UV spectra with that of a standard commercial
    compound.', The preparation of the samples was based on the method described by
    researchers with minor changes ., "The sample preparation procedure included the
    extraction of acrylamide with 80% methanol in water, de-fatting with hexane, freezing
    to \u221218 \xB0C and clean-up by SPE with HLB 200 mg cartridges.", "Four grams
    of each food sample were homogenized with 20 ml of 80% methanol and shaken in
    a thermostated water bath set at 60 \xB0C for 60 min.", 'After the extraction
    of acrylamide, the samples were filtered through filter-paper to complete the
    de-fatting process.', A portion of hexane was added and shaken for 10 min., The
    upper hexane layer was removed and the de-fatting step was then repeated., "Five
    millilitres of aqueous solution was transferred to centrifuge tubes and frozen
    to \u221218 \xB0C for 24 h and subsequently centrifuged at 5,000 rpm for 10 min.",
  The clear supernatant was then cleaned up with Oasis HLB SPE cartridges purchased
    from Waters., "The final sample was filtered through a 0.45 \u03BCm nylon syringe
    filter and analyzed by RP \u2014 HPLC.", "The acrylamide concentrations are expressed
    in \u03BCg/kg.", 'The method was validated by defining the linearity, LOD and
    repeatability, precision and recovery.', 'The linearity of the standard curve
    was expressed in terms of the correlation coefficient, the plot of the integrated
    peak area vs. the concentration of the standard.', "A linear regression equation
    \\\\( \\left( {{\\text{y}} = 0.00{\\text{18x}} - 0.0{299}} \\right) \\\\) was
    found, with satisfactory linearity over the range of 0.01\u201320 \u03BCg/ml.",
  This was used to calculate the amount of acrylamide in food samples., "The detection
    limits were calculated as 10 \u03BCg/kg, which adequately determined the trace
    quantification of acrylamide in potato products.", 'Both the repeatability and
    precision of the method were demonstrated by repetitive analyses, and calculating
    the average relative standard deviation for the determination of concentration
    of acrylamide in ten one-batch samples of potato products.', "The quantitative
    analysis of potato products was in the concentration range of 380\u2013451 \u03BCg/kg
    for acrylamide.", "The relative standard deviations obtained for acrylamide were
    less than 5%, which is a normal level in any food quality control and is usually
    satisfactory according to the Horwitz\u2019s formula for intra-laboratory analysis
    .", The mean recovery was 106%., The recovery rate of the method was generally
    accepted for the determination of acrylamide in a variety of foods., This chromatographic
    procedure was applied to the determination of acrylamide concentration in the
    different potato products in this study., 'Acetonitrile, methanol, hexane and
    all other chemicals were of analytical grade and obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and
    from Merck.', The acrylamide standard was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical
    Company., Stock standards were prepared in 80% methanol., "The stock solution
    of acrylamide was 20, 10, 5.0, 2.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.25, 0.10, 0.05, 0.01 \u03BCg/ml.",
  "All solutions were stored at 4 \xB0C in glass light-resistant bottles.", 'The HPLC
    method for the determination of acrylamide was validated using the certified reference
    material, which was supplied by the IRMM,.', Each experiment was comprised of
    three replications., "The data were expressed as means \xB1 standard deviation.",
  Statistical analysis was performed with the software package Statistica 9.0., "Significant
    differences were calculated according to Duncan\u2019s Multiple range test at
    the 5% level were considered statistically significant.", 'The purpose of this
    study was mainly to compare the effects of different domestic preparation methods
    of par-fried potato products such as pan-frying, and deep-frying, roasting and
    microwave treatment on the acrylamide formation.', Acrylamide was found in all
    deep-frozen par-fried potato products before final preparation., The results obtained
    before final preparation of all samples are presented in Table 2., "It was not
    surprising to note that the ready\u2013to-eat frozen potato products, which were
    pre-prepared and pre-cooked, had a certain acrylamide content.", "The mean level
    of acrylamide content in all frozen potato products before final preparation was
    found to be 322 \u03BCg/kg,.", 'For the other-than-French-fry potato products,
    the acrylamide content was always lower compared to French fries.', The shoestring
    French fries had the greatest concentration and cubed potato products had the
    lowest acrylamide content., 'All potato products contain a high level of acrylamide,
    probably caused by the initial heating process of the products.', The differences
    observed in the acrylamide content of these par-fried products before final preparation
    at home suggests that manufacturers should optimize the production process for
    ready-to-eat frozen potato products., 'The latter should therefore be optimized
    for temperature, time and raw materials.', 'In regards to raw materials, attention
    should be paid to acrylamide precursors and the quality of the potato.', "Acrylamide

    preparation methods  \n\n\n\n\nStatistical analysis for the effect of conditional

    b, c \u2013 Mean in table followed by the same letter are not significantly different\n\nThe
    statistical analysis of the different types of French fries before final preparation
    showed no significant relationship between acrylamide content and the form and
    size of the French fries.", 'However, there was a significant difference between
    the form and size of other potato products.', "Statistical analysis for the effect
    of potato products type on acrylamide content  \n\n\nA Mean \xB1 standard deviation,
    a, b, c, d \u2013 Mean in columns followed by the same letter are not significantly
    different, n = The number of the same type of products\n\nThe effect of preparation
    methods, including time and temperature of processing, on the acrylamide content
    of the French fries and other-than-French-fries potato products was evaluated
    using a factorial design with two levels for conditions of processing, and four
    levels for domestic preparing methods.", Table 3 shows the effects of conditional
    processing on the acrylamide content of samples., Acrylamide content showed an
    increase as the temperature and time of processing increased., "The acrylamide
    content of samples reached 482 \u03BCg/kg after preparing for 3 min at 180 \xB0C
    as opposed to 678 \u03BCg/kg after preparing for 10 min at 220 \xB0C.", The statistical
    analysis showed significant differences in acrylamide content as a function of
    varieties for both conditions of processing., Many researchers have also reported
    that temperature and time processing were very important factors influencing the
    formation of acrylamide., The effect of high-temperature and long-time treatment
    of foods on acrylamide formation was investigated., 'It was found that these factors
    were responsible for a great decrease in AA levels in foods, without causing significant
    changes in the colour or texture parameters.', "In some previous studies, it was
    indicated that the temperature is required to be higher than 120 \xB0C for the
    development of acrylamide.", 'With reference to potato products, the suggested
    technological interventions for AA mitigation are relevant to pre-treatments as
    well as formulation and process changes .', "Statistical analysis for the effect
    of preparation methods on the acrylamide content of potato products  \n\n\nA Mean
    \xB1 standard deviation, B French fries, n = 11, C Other potato products, n =
    12, D All products, n = 23,\n\na, b, c, d \u2013 Mean in columns followed by the
    same letter are not significantly different\n\nThe preparation methods under roasting
    were also lower in acrylamide content than the preparation methods under microwaving.",
  The highest acrylamide levels for French fries and other-than- French-fries potato
    products were found when these foods were treated with microwave radiation., 'The
    mean value of all samples were higher than that of roasting, although both preparation
    methods used the same conditions.', These results suggest that acrylamide is also
    produced in potato products under microwave heat processing just like conventional
    heating methods., 'Additionally, microwaving might be more favourable to the formation
    of acrylamide than conventional heating methods, such as roasting.', 'Many studies
    have reported that various factors affected the reaction yields of acrylamide,
    such as the temperature, heating time, types of sugar compounds and water concentration
    .', 'Not only heating temperature and time, but also the modality of heat transfer
    are regarded to be important process factors influencing acrylamide formation.',
  The heat processing method contributing to the formation of acrylamide should also
    be taken into consideration ., The microwave heating method is different than
    conventional heating., 'For conventional heating such as boiling, roasting or
    frying, heat transfer is mainly by convection and conduction or radiation.', 'Microwaves
    offer a fast temperature rise in foods owing to their capacity to generate heat
    energy inside the food, without requiring any medium as a vehicle for heat transfer.',
  'The specific microwave effect, such as the effect of an electromagnetic field,
    acts directly on the polar molecules of the samples, causing the rotation or the
    liberation of chemical bonds, resulting in a weakening of the chemical bond, a
    lowering of the reaction energy and an acceleration of the chemical reaction.',
  'A low thermal conductivity product may quickly reach high temperatures which, does
    not occur in conventional heating.', Microwave heating provides a favourable medium
    for the production of acrylamide and probably affects the formation and kinetics
    of acrylamide due to its extraordinary heating style., The present results suggest
    that the specific microwave effect could play a larger role than conventional
    heating in intensifying the formation of acrylamide., Other authors have also
    presented similar results., 'The studies have quantified a large amount of acrylamide
    in microwave- heated grated potatoes, which was even higher than some potato samples
    under a frying treatment.', 'Moreover, it was demonstrated that concentrations
    of acrylamide in potato baked after being precooked by the microwave pre-treatment
    were higher than those in the products baked without being pre-cooked.', These
    results indicate that microwave heating might induce a high amount of acrylamide
    contaminant in foods ., 'Therefore, there is a need for further studies on this
    issue.', 'Moreover, it is necessary to consider a possible reduction of microwave
    heating in the processing of carbohydrate-rich food.', 'In conclusion, the discovery
    of acrylamide in commonly-heated foods has shaken consumer confidence in the quality
    and safety of thermally processed foods.', "Acrylamide is present in ready\u2013to-eat
    food even before heat treatment in the home.", "This study demonstrated that acrylamide
    is present in all samples of ready\u2013to-eat frozen potato products available
    in local supermarkets.", 'Nowadays, reducing the acrylamide content of foods has
    become a major target for the food industry.', 'Thus, the principal objective
    must be to try to reduce this compound which is formed during food production.',
  Our results show that the temperature and time of thermal processing of potato products
    are important factors in the formation of acrylamide., 'Therefore, the heat treatment
    parameters of the products during processing such as baking, frying, roasting,
    or microwaving in the home should be controlled and reduced as much as possible.',
  'Generally, the consumer is not aware of the actual oven temperature and this may
    differ from the temperature setting.', 'Thus, there is a need for better temperature-controlled
    domestic ovens.', 'This study also demonstrated that, compared to conventional
    heating such as roasting, microwave treatment is more favourable for the formation
    of acrylamide in potato products under the same processing conditions.', Microwave
    heating has a marked effect on the formation of acrylamide., 'Therefore, the use
    of microwave heating for the thermal processing of carbohydrate-rich food should
    be limited as much as possible.', 'This article is distributed under the terms
