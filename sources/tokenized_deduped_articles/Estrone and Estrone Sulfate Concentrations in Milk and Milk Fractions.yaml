['Dairy products naturally contain estrogens, and some consumer groups contend these
    estrogens cause adverse health effects.', 'The objectives of this research were
    to characterize estrone and estrone sulfate concentrations in milk from a large
    number of individual cows, in skim and fat fractions of milk, and in retail milk
    to provide food and nutrition practitioners with information to estimate potential
    consumption.', Milk was from Holstein cows., Data are presented as means and standard
    deviations., Analysis of variance was used to determine differences in E1 and
    E1S content of whole milk and its skim and fat fractions., "Mean E1 and E1S concentrations
    were 7.0\xB112.7 and 46.7\xB162.1 pg/mL, respectively.", Analysis of milk fractions
    demonstrated that 55% of E1 and 14% of E1S were associated with the fat fraction
    with the remainder associated with the skim fraction., "Concentrations of E1 and
    E1S in pasteurized-homogenized whole milk averaged 10.3\xB10.6 and 85.9\xB17.3
    pg/mL, respectively.", 'Production rates of E1 plus estradiol in human beings
    range from 54,000 to 630,000 ng/day.', "US Food and Drug administration guidelines
    state that no physiologic effects occur when consumption is \u22641% of the endogenous
    quantities produced by the segment of the population with the lowest daily production.",
  This threshold value for intake would be 540 ng/day., 'Estimated total E1 intake
    from three servings of whole milk was 68 ng/day, which represents 0.01% to 0.1%
    of daily production rates in human beings.', These findings support levels below
    the current guidelines for safe consumption.]
