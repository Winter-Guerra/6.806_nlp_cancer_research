[Epidemiological studies have investigated the potential anticancer effects of mushroom
    intake., This review aims to clarify the evidence on the association of dietary
    mushroom intake with breast cancer risk and to quantify its dose-response relationship.,
  'Relevant studies were identified by a search of PubMed, Web of Science and Google
    Scholar up to December 31, 2013.', Observational studies with relative risks or
    hazard ratios or odd ratios and 95% confidence intervals of breast cancer for
    three or more categories of mushroom intake were eligible., The quality of included
    studies was assessed by using Newcastle-Ottawa Scale., A dose-response meta-analysis
    was performed by utilizing generalized least squares trend estimation., Eight
    case-control studies and two cohort studies with a total of 6890 cases were ultimately
    included., 'For dose-response analysis, there was no evidence of non-linear association
    between mushroom consumption and breast cancer risk and a 1 g/d increment in mushroom
    intake conferred an RR of 0.97 for breast cancer risk, with moderate heterogeneity.',
  'Besides, available menopause data extracted from included studies were used to
    evaluate the influence of menopausal statues.', 'The summary RRs of mushroom consumption
    on breast cancer were 0.96 for premenopausal women and 0.94 for postmenopausal
    women, respectively.', 'Our findings demonstrated that mushroom intake may be
    inversely associated with risk of breast cancer, which need to be confirmed with
    large-scale prospective studies further.', 'Citation: Li J, Zou L, Chen W, Zhu

    and the leading cause of cancer death for female in both developed and developing
    countries, accounting for 23% of the total new cancer cases and 14% of the total
    cancer deaths in 2008 .', 'The high prevalence and incidence have led to a large
    public health burden all over the world, thus more attention should be paid to
    the primary prevention of breast cancer.', Lifestyle factors are considered to
    play an important role in the prevention of breast cancer since they could be
    modified ., 'Intriguingly, many lifestyle factors make different effects on breast
    cancer risk according to different menopausal status , .', 'Menopausal status
    was closely related to breast cancer, with the mediation of hormone levels change
    in women.', 'The risk factors of premenopausal breast cancer were also not completely
    as same as that of postmenopausal breast cancer , suggesting underling etiologies
    may be different.', 'In addition, the prognosis and treatment options of breast
    cancer depend on menopausal status.', Exemplified by the fact that aromatase inhibitors
    had been particularly given to the hormone therapy of postmenopausal hormone-dependent
    breast cancer ., 'So, its important to take menopausal status into account, if
    possible, in breast cancer research.', 'As essential components of lifestyle,
    diet-related factors are thought to account for about 30% of cancers in developed
    countries .', 'Various daily foods, such as cruciferous vegetables , fish , coffee
    , tea , and soy products , have been indicated to be correlated with the risk
    of breast cancer by numerous studies.', 'Mushroom, as a common vegetable supplied
    in daily diet worldwide, contains an abundance of pharmaceutically active compounds.',
  'The most investigated compound derived from mushroom is polysaccharide, which has
    antitumor and immunomodulating properties .', 'Laboratory studies have demonstrated
    the antitumor activity of specific mushrooms, in particular, medicinal mushrooms
    both in vivo and in vitro , .', 'Moreover, adjuvant treatments with medicinal
    mushroom extracts were shown to be capable of improving prognosis of breast cancer
    , , though their exact effectiveness need to be confirmed.', "Several studies
    reported an adverse association of edible mushroom intake with the risk of breast
    cancer \u2013.", "However, some other researches failed to observe the significant
    protective effect of mushroom consumption against breast cancer \u2013.", 'Given
    the inconsistent results of the existing literature and limited sample sizes of
    individual studies, we conducted a meta-analysis of observational studies with
    the following objectives: to summarize the evidence on the association between
    edible mushroom consumption and risk of breast cancer and quantify the potential
    dose-response pattern; to examine whether the relationship is affected by menopausal
    status.', "We performed a systematic literature search on PubMed, Web of Science,
    and Google Scholar up to December 31, 2013 using the following key words: \u201Cmushroom\u201D
    or \u201Cfungi\u201D and \u201Cbreast cancer\u201D, \u201Cbreast carcinoma\u201D,
    \u201Cbreast tumor\u201D or \u201Cbreast tumour\u201D.", The reference lists of
    selected articles were also scrutinized to obtain additional pertinent publications.,
  Only articles written in English were included., "Studies were eligible if they
    met the following criteria: the study had a case-control or cohort design; the
    exposure of interest was dietary intake of edible mushroom; the outcome was the
    occurrence of breast cancer; the study provided relative risks, hazard ratios
    or odds ratios with 95% CIs for \u2267 3 categories of exposure; the number of
    cases and the total subjects or follow-up person-years for each category of mushroom
    intake were reported or derivable by published data.", 'If an article reported
    results for premenopausal and postmenopausal women respectively, we separated
    this article into two independent studies by menopausal status.', 'The following
    information were extracted from each included study: the first authors name, year
    of publication, study population, study design, age of participants, number of
    cases, menopausal status, daily mushroom consumption, OR, RR or HR with corresponding
    95% CI for each category of mushroom consumption and adjusted potential confounders.',
  The effect size that reflected the greatest degree of adjustment for potential confounders
    was included., The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale  was used to assess the quality of the
    eligible studies., 'Each study included in the meta-analysis was judged on three
    broad dimensions: the selection of the study subjects, the comparability of the
    study populations and the ascertainment of the exposure in case-control studies
    or outcome of interest in cohort studies.', 'A study can be awarded a maximum
    of one star for each numbered item within the selection and exposure or outcome
    categories, but two stars for item of comparability.', 'Thus, the total score
    for a single study ranges from zero to nine.', A study was considered to be of
    high quality if scored seven or more stars., 'The RR and HR are assumed to approximate
    the OR because of the low incidence of breast cancer , thus we combined the RR
    and HR with OR in current meta-analysis and reported the summary effect size as
    RR for simplicity.', 'For each study, the median or midpoint of upper and lower
    boundaries was assigned as the average intake of mushroom in each category.',
  'If the upper boundary of the highest category was not provided, we assumed that
    the upper boundary had the same amplitude as the closest category.', We performed
    a dose-response model by using general least-squares trend estimation as described
    by Greenland and Longnecker ., "This approach which based on constructing approximate
    covariance estimates for the log relative risks and estimating corrected linear
    or non-linear trend using general least squares has been widely applied in previously
    published meta-analyses \u2013.", We also established a restricted cubic spline
    model to explore the potential non-linear relationship ., Cubic splines are generally
    defined as piecewise-polynomial line segments whose function values and first
    and second derivatives agree at the boundaries where they join., 'The boundaries
    of these segments are called knots, and the fitted curve is continuous and smooth
    at the knot boundaries .', 'In this meta-analysis, we established a cubic spline
    model with 3 knots at 25%, 50% and 75% percentiles of the distribution and a P
    value for non-linearity was calculated by testing the null hypothesis that the
    coefficient of the second spline was equal to zero.', The between-study heterogeneity
    was assessed by the Cochran Q test and I2 statistic and it was considered significant
    if P;0.10 for Q statistic or I2&gt;50%., 'When there was significant heterogeneity
    detected, data from included studies were combined by random-effects model; otherwise,
    the fixed-effects model was utilized.', 'Meta-regression was initially conducted
    to find the source of heterogeneity, and then subgroup analysis was carried out
    if feasible.', Sensitivity analyses were executed by deleting each study in turn
    to estimate the influence of individual studies on the pooled estimate., 'Besides,
    we evaluated publication bias by Beggs and Eggers regression tests.', All statistical
    analyses were conducted with Stata 10.0 and a P&lt;0.05 was considered statistically
    significant unless noted otherwise., The flow chart of literature search was shown
    in Figure 1., 'Initially, 5734 articles were identified by literature search,
    of which 5687 articles were excluded after review of titles or abstracts.', 'Forty
    articles were further excluded due to the following reasons: no report of the
    association between mushroom intake and breast cancer risk; data of exposure or
    risk estimates not available; dichotomized categories of mushroom consumption;
    comment or review.', "Finally, seven original articles \u2013, , ,  that met our
    inclusion criteria were included in this study.", 'Three articles provided independent
    data by menopausal status, thus were considered apart.', 'Therefore, ten independent
    studies were eventually applied for the dose-response meta-analysis.', 'Of the
    included studies, eight adopting case-control design with 2313 cases and 2387
    controls were conducted in Asian and two adopting cohort design with 4,577 cases
    and 1,748,623 follow-up person-years were conducted in Europe.', 'All of the ten
    studies scored six or more stars, and seven out of the ten studies were of high
    quality.', The main characteristics of included studies were summarized in Table
    1., There was no evidence of significant departure from linearity among data from
    the 10 studies., 'A 1 g/d increment in mushroom consumption conferred an RR of
    0.97 for breast cancer risk, with moderate heterogeneity.', The study-specific
    RRs per 1 g/d increase in mushroom consumption were presented in Figure 3., Figure
    2., 'The dose-response analysis for the association of mushroom consumption and
    breast cancer risk, with restricted cubic splines in random-effects dose-response
    model.', 'The solid line and the short dash line represent the estimated relative
    risks and corresponding 95% CIs, respectively.', Figure 3., Study-specific dose-response
    analyses for the relationship between mushroom consumption and risk of breast
    cancer., Meta-analyses for premenopausal and postmenopausal women were performed
    separately to detect the role of menopausal status in the relationship between
    mushroom intake and breast cancer risk., Four studies were not included in this
    analysis owing to lack of data split by menopausal status., 'There was significant
    heterogeneity among studies for premenopausal women, while no evidence of heterogeneity
    was detected among studies for postmenopausal women.', 'Significant associations
    were observed in both groups, with the summary RRs being 0.96 for premenopausal
    women and 0.94 for postmenopausal women.', Figure 4., Dose-response meta-analyses
    for premenopausal and postmenopausal women., Meta-regression was performed to
    explore potential sources of between-study heterogeneity., 'Firstly, an empty
    regression was run to estimate the baseline value for tau2.', 'Then, univariate
    meta-regressions were successively conducted with following covariates: study
    population, study design, number of adjusted confounders, number of cases, whether
    adjusted for body mass index, whether adjusted for cigarette smoking, whether
    adjusted for alcohol drinking and whether adjusted for physical activity, respectively.',
  'As a result, none of these variables showed statistically significant associations
    in univeriate meta-regression models, suggesting that factors which mentioned
    above could not explain the heterogeneity among studies.', 'Considering the negative
    result of meta-regression, subgroup analysis was not conducted further.', Sensitivity
    analysis was carried out by omitted one study at a time and calculated the combined
    RR for remaining studies., The relevant between-study heterogeneity were significant
    except the study conducted in premenopausal women by Zhang et al., was excluded.,
  'But after removed this study, there was still an adverse association of mushroom
    consumption and breast cancer risk.', 'The results were not materially altered
    when other studies was deleted in turn, with RRs ranging from 0.96 to 0.97.',
  'For publication bias, funnel plot showed no obvious asymmetry.', 'Besides, neither
    Eggers regression test nor Beggs test detected evidence of publication bias.',
  'The meta-analysis including 10 eligible studies indicated a linear dose-response
    association between mushroom intake and risk of breast cancer, with the summary
    RR being 0.97 for per 1 g/d increment in mushroom consumption.', 'Besides, the
    protective effects of mushroom intake on risk of breast cancer were consistently
    exhibited in premenopausal women and in postmenopausal women.', Potential benefits
    to breast cancer patients taking high dosage of the extract of specific medicinal
    mushrooms over long term have been well-studied with positive results ., While
    benefits of oral administration of mushrooms on breast cancer risk were still
    unclear., 'In the present meta-analysis, the summary RRs of breast cancer presented
    a steady linear decrease with the increasing intake of edible mushroom.', Extensive
    evidences from biological and clinical studies have addressed the most important
    properties of mushroom in the antitumor and immuno-modulating activities., 'As
    we know, it is actually the biologically active substances of mushroom which play
    a key role in various vital processes including antitumor activities .', "The
    major bioactive compounds of edible mushrooms especially polysaccharides and glucan
    function in the antitumor activity, which were strongly supported by evidences
    from in vitro and in vivo experiments \u2013.", 'For example, a study reported
    by Jeong et al.', "indicated that polysaccharides isolated from Agaricus bisporus
    white button mushroom, a common edible mushroom consumed in most countries, had
    the ability to inhibit the growth of human breast cancer MCF-7 cells in part through
    activation of nuclear factor-\u03BAB with the production of p50/105 heterodimers.",
  'Additionally, in in vivo experiments, a reduction in tumor growth was observed
    when murine sarcoma 180 cells exposed to polysaccharides were implanted subcutaneously
    into mice .', 'Meanwhile, Amauroderma rude, a well-known medicinal mushroom, has
    been reported could inhibit cancer cell survival and induce apoptosis, and suppression
    of c-myc expression appeared to be associated with these effects .', These pre-existing
    researches verified the beneficial therapeutic effects of edible and medicinal
    mushrooms on breast cancer., 'However, their preventive benefits against breast
    cancer have not been elucidated.', We supposed that polysaccharides may bring
    down the occurrence of breast cancer through their strikingly effects on immune
    system., 'The polysaccharides were regarded as biological response modifiers,
    by which both innate and adaptive immune responses can be modulated.', 'With different
    structures, polysaccharides present distinct affinities towards their specific
    receptors to trigger a wide spectrum of host immune responses , which were capable
    of recognizing aberrant transformed cells and eliminating tumor cells .', 'Although
    the present meta-analysis supported the role of edible mushrooms in the suppression
    of breast cancer, association studies with larger sample size and well-designed
    clinical studies are still warranted to further verify the significant results.',
  'Interestingly, the health benefits of mushroom intake for breast cancer presented
    no difference between premenopausal and postmenopausal women in our meta-analysis.',
  'Considering only three eligible studies included in the meta-analysis, it was not
    very appropriate to make a conclusion about whether the linear trend between mushroom
    intake and risk of breast cancer influenced by the menopausal status.', 'By now,
    a few epidemiological studies have investigated this association by menopausal
    status and almost no experimental study has been conducted for the biological
    function of mushroom or mushroom extracts intake on the risk of breast cancer
    in terms of the hormone circumstance.', 'It was worth to note that the association
    between mushroom intake and risk of breast cancer stratified by menopausal status
    need to be further explored in large perspective studies, and the underlying mechanisms
    should be uncovered by functional studies.', "The development of breast cancer
    is a multifactorial process, thus the association between mushroom and breast
    cancer may be confounded by many other factors \u2013, which possibly brought
    heterogeneity to the meta-analysis.", 'Considering the between-study heterogeneity,
    meta-regression analysis has been conducted to search for the source of the heterogeneity.',
  'Unfortunately, no factor was identified.', 'However, the between-study heterogeneity
    was disappeared after we excluded a study conducted in premenopausal women by
    Zhang et al.', 'in sensitivity analysis, implying the removed study might account
    for a proportion of heterogeneity.', We speculated that the characteristics of
    the sub-population reported by Zhang et al., 'might differ from other included
    ones, but more detailed information was not offered in the study.', 'Nevertheless,
    the sensitive analysis confirmed the stability of the significant association
    between mushroom consumption and breast cancer risk.', The strengths for the current
    meta-analysis had been summarized., 'To the best of our knowledge, the meta-analysis
    firstly systematically explored the pooled effect for edible mushroom consumption
    on the risk of breast cancer.', 'Besides, our analysis precisely estimated the
    pooled relative risks with an application of dose-response approaches.', 'Moreover,
    we have convinced that the results of our systematic meta-analysis, in essence,
    were stable and reliable after performing sensitivity analyses and testing the
    publication bias.', 'Despite the clear strengths, some limitations should be acknowledged.',
  'First, the number of eligible studies included in the meta-analysis was relatively
    insufficient.', 'Besides, despite of 70% high-quality studies, only two of the
    ten included studies were prospectively designed, thus additional large-scale
    and well-designed studies are warranted.', 'Second, we have no opportunity to
    identify the source of heterogeneity because of the limited information extracted
    from the original studies.', 'Oral administration of mushrooms in suppressing
    breast cancer involves many confounders and thus benefits of mushroom consumption
    are less convincing, as opposed to extracts.', 'Although most original studies
    had adjusted many potential confounding factors, other heterogeneous natures of
    studies, such as demographic, reproductive factors and other lifestyle characteristics,
    possibly made effect on the current results.', 'However, we could not perform
    further analysis owing to lack of detailed data.', 'Further, we couldnt ignore
    the heterogeneous effects of different mushroom types since there were too many
    different mushroom species in different countries.', Its a big challenge for us
    to restrict edible mushroom species., Thus our result indicated the combined effects
    of many edible mushrooms., 'In conclusion, the results from this meta-analysis
    suggested that greater edible mushroom consumption may be associated with a lower
    risk of breast cancer.', Our research provided a perspective that oral administration
    of mushrooms perhaps contribute to breast cancer primary prevention., 'Whereas
    available data are still sparse, the findings need to be updated and confirmed
    with well-designed prospective studies in future.', PRISMA checklist., Preferred
