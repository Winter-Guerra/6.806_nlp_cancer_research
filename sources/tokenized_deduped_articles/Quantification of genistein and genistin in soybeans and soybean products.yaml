['It has been suggested that the isoflavone, genistein,, may have some role as a chemopreventive
    agent against cancer in humans.', "Levels of genistein and its \xCE\xB2-glucoside
    conjugate, genistin, ingested in soybeans and related bean products by the Japanese
    were quantified by HPLC, to estimate daily intake of these compounds.", "Amounts
    of genistein and genistin in soybeans, soy nuts and soy powder were in the range
    of 4.6 to 18.2 and 200.6 to 968.1 \xCE\xBCg/g food, respectively.", "The values
    for soy milk and tofu were 1.9 to 13.9 and 94.8 to 137.7 \xCE\xBCg/g food, respectively.",
  "Levels of isoflavones in fermented soybean products, miso and natto, were 38.5
    to 229.1 \xCE\xBCg/g food for genistein and 71.7 to 492.8 \xCE\xBCg/g food for
    genistin.", 'Thus, the level of genistein in the fermented soybean products was
    higher them in soy beans and soybean products such as soy milk and tofu.', "From
    these observations, it is suggested that the \xCE\xB2-glycosyl bond of genistin
    is cleaved to produce genistein by microbes during fermentation to yield miso
    and natto.", 'Soy sauce was also found to contain both isoflavones, but at levels
    lower than in miso and natto.', 'On the basis of these data for average annual
    consumption of soybeans and related products, daily intake of genistein and genistin
    by the Japanese is calculated to be 1.5-4.1 and 6.3-8.3 mg/person, respectively.',
  'These levels are much higher than those for Americans or Western Europeans, whose
    mortality rates for breast, colon and prostate cancers are greater than the Japanese.']
