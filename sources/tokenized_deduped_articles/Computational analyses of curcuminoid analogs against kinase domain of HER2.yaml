    study, both computational and experimental studies were performed.', The specificity
    of curcumin analogs selected from the docked results was examined against human
    breast cancer cell lines., The screened curcumin compounds were then subjected
    to molecular dynamics simulation study., 'By modifying curcumin analogs, we found
    that protein-ligand affinity increases.', The benzene ring with a hydroxyl group
    could enhance affinity by forming hydrophobic interactions and the hydrogen bond
    with the hydrophobic pocket., 'Hydroxyl, carbonyl or methoxy group also formed
    hydrogen bonds with residues in the adenine pocket and sugar pocket of HER2-TK.',
  These modifications could suggest the new drug design for potentially effective
    HER2-TK inhibitors., 'Two outstanding compounds, bisdemethylcurcumin and 3,5-bis((E)-3,4-dimethoxystyryl)isoxazole,were
    well oriented in the binding pocket almost in the simulation time, 30 ns.', This
    evidence confirmed the results of cell-based assays and the docking studies.,
  'They possessed more distinguished interactions than known HER2-TK inhibitors, considering
    them as a promising drug in the near future.', The series of curcumin compounds
    were screened using a computational molecular docking and followed by human breast
    cancer cell lines assay., Both AS-KTC006 and AS-KTC021 could inhibit breast cancer

    downstream pathways such as Ras/Raf/MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways to increase cell
    growth, cell survival and cell differentiation .', 'Considerable evidencesshowed

    molecules, AS-KTC018 to AS-KTC024.', The docked conformations of all curcumin
    compounds were well oriented in the ATP-binding pocket of HER2-TK., 'One phenyl-end
    of curcuminoids compounds oriented well in deep hydrophobic pocket, while another
    phenyl-end exposed to the open gate.', 'They could form interactions either with
    Met801 or with Cys805, depending on each configuration of analog.', 'According
    to the revealed three dimensional structure of HER2-TK adopted the active-like
    conformation, the binding cave stayed in the tunnel shape rather than the opened
    cave as presented in EGFR-TK.', "This pocket possesses approximately the volume
    of 475 \xC53.", 'As the binding pocket adopted the tunnel-like shape, the curcuminoid
    structures are also in the linear cylinder shape that can fit into this pocket
    quite well.', The hydrophobic-I site merged with the phosphate binding region
    as the deep semi-closed site of ATP-binding pocket., 'This pocket is occupied
    by the trifluoromethyl-phenoxy fragment of SYR, the co-crystal ligand.', 'Furthermore,

    groups of modified middle-linear seven carbon linkage of curcurmin analogs pointed

    interactions were considered important to increase selectivity and affinity for
    HER2 inhibitors ., 'However, the curcumin analogs could not interact with Met801
    as any other EGFR/HER2-TK inhibitors, which contain 4-anilinoquinazoline, pyrrolopyrimidine,
    pyrrolotriazine and cyanoquinoline cores.', "The carbonyl group of the linkage
    chain, from \u03B2-diketone or monoketoncurcumins, could form a hydrogen bond

    that of SYR127063 and other HER2 inhibitors that was a water-mediated hydrogen
    bond between N3 of quinazoline and Thr862 ., 'As the direct hydrogen bond formation
    at this position was crucial to enhance binding affinity, N3 of quinazoline was
    modified to nitrile group to form the direct hydrogen bond .', These occupancy
    and interactions mimicked those of a heterocyclic core of HER2 inhibitor in an
    adenine ring of ATP ., 'All 24 selected compounds have been processed in further

    using a commercialized HER2-TK, but unfortunately, activity of the HER2-TK could
    not be detected.', Moreover curcumins were stable and soluble in very low pH which
    is not suitable for HER2-TK to stay active., 'Therefore, the cell-based assay
    was chosen instead of the purified protein based assay to investigate the inhibitory
    effect of curcumin analogs to HER2-TK.', 'In order to identify the curcumin analogs
    against HER2-TK, two different types of human breast cancer cell lines, MCF-7
    and SKBR3 were performed.', The SKBR3 is a breast cancer cell line which over-expresses
    the HER2 gene product while the MCF-7 is in absence of HER2 protein overexpression
    ., 'Therefore, such compounds should be more effective against SKBR3 than MCF-7.',
  The lapatinib which was tested on both breast cancer cell lines showed the IC50
    on SKBR3 lower than MCF-7 ., Twenty-four selected compounds were determined IC50
    on both breast cancer cell lines by MTT assay as shown in Table 2., 'Although
    most of curcumin analogs have very similar structures, each analog showed different
    activities on both cells.', "In the \u03B2-diketone group from Table 1, only AS-KTC006

    this group composes of \u03B2-diketone which is modified substituent from natural
    curcumins.", On the other hand none of curcumin analogs in monoketone and pyrazole
    groups showed selectively inhibiting activity among both cancer cell-lines., 'In
    the last group, AS-KTC021 also presented the outstanding suppress on SKBR3 but
    not MCF7 among isoxazole analogs.', "The IC50 for AS-KTC006 and AS-KTC021 in SKBR3

    were higher than 100 \u03BCM.", 'Since both AS-KTC006 and AS-KTC021 were selected
    from docking results, they could inhibit the breast cancer cells through blocking

    of the bothAS-KTC006 and AS-KTC021 curcuminoids in the ATP-binding pocket of HER2-TK.',
  'As mention in the previous section, the x-ray crystal structure of HER2-TK, 3PP0

    HER2-TK-AS-KTC006 and HER2-TK-AS-KTC021 which were constructed using molecular
    docking procedure have been used as starting coordinates for MD calculations.,
  The root mean square deviations of all systems seemed to fit nicely in the binding
    pocket of HER2-TK., 'The structure of curcuminoid distinguishes from other known

    based structures .', 'The structures of curcumin analogs adopted the long thread
    with two knots at each end, resulting in freely flexible structure in the tunnel-like

    between H-N atom of Met801 and N-atom at position N11 of SYR existed about 94.73%
    along the entire 30 ns of simulation time.', 'On the other hand, the curcumin
    analogs possess the interesting hydrogen bond pairs in both AS-KTC006 and AS-KTC021.',
  "Rather than forming hydrogen bond with Met801, the \u03B2-diketone curcumin analog
    formed hydrogen bonds to Thr862, Cys805 and Asp863, in the binding pocket of HER2-TK.",
  'The formation with these three amino acids existed approximately 34.67%, 10.17%
    and 9.17%, respectively along the entire MD simulations.', Distances chromatograms
    of each pairwise atom from H-bond analyses were shown in Figure 4., 'One of these
    three residues is DFG-motif, and another is adjacent residue of DFG-motif.', 'For
    AS-KTC021, the hydrogen boding with Cys805 and Thr862 existed about 35.97% and
    5.37%, respectively, along the entire MD simulations.', 'As illustrated in Figure
    2C and 2D, one of the phenyl-end of curcumin compounds were well oriented in the
    ATP-binding pocket of HER2-TK, while the other-end exposed to solvent giving a
    chance to interact with Cys805, while the linker in the middle of cucurmin structure
    could interact with Thr862.', The binding residues of SYR-HER2-TK systems appear
    to be stable along the MD simulations., The system started to converge since 15
    ns of simulations time., 'In addition, the simulation systems of AS-KTC006-HER2TK
    and AS-KTC021-HER2TK seem to converge after 25 ns of simulations time.', From
    the molecular dynamic results suggested that AS-KTC006 had better binding affinity
    with HER2-TK than that of AS-KTC021., 'Considering at the curcuminoids structures,
    AS-KTC006 is more flexible than AS-KTC021.', "In particular, AS-KTC0006 possesses
    \u03B2-diketonemoiety on both sides providing the flexibility of the molecule
    and allowing O-atom of ketone to interact with Thr862.", The binding energy calculations
    were performed to further understand the interactions of each system., "It is
    to be noted that protein\u2013ligand entropy contributions were not included in
    these free energy values since the present MM-PBSA are typically time consuming
    and unreliable.", "Considering the intermolecular interaction of the ligands with
    HER2-TK in contribution terms, non-polar contributions, the summation of \u0394EVDW

    ligand AS-KTC006 shows the most favorable electrostatic interaction with the binding
    pocket of HER2TK.', 'There are the agreement between MM-PBSA binding energy calculations,
    docking and MD simulations.', 'The consistent observations were presented in all
    three different computational approaches, namely, focusing on O-atom of ketone
