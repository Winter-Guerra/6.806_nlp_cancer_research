[We previously demonstrated the protective effects of blueberry and black raspberry
    supplemented at 2.5% dose in an ACI rat mammary tumor model., 'Here, we assessed
    a dose-related alteration in tumor indices with diet supplemented with 5% BB or
    BRB powder.', The diet was well tolerated., 'Tumor palpation from 12 weeks revealed
    first tumor appearance by 84 days in the control group, that was delayed by 24
    and 39 days with the BB and BRB diets, respectively.', "Ellagic acid detected
    in the plasma of rats fed the BRB diet was in the range of 96.6\u2013294.2 ng/mL.",
  'While the BB diet showed better efficacy in reducing mammary tissue proliferation
    and tumor burden, tumor latency was delayed efficiently by BRB.', "Furthermore,
    BB was effective in downregulating CYP1A1 expression, while BRB downregulated
    ER\u03B1 expression effectively.", Distinct anticarcinogenic effects of the two
    berries correspond to their distinct phytochemical signatures., 'blueberry; black

    Prolonged exposure to estrogen is a major risk factor for breast cancer.', (1)
    Estrogens are structurally related steroids that regulate cell proliferation and
    differentiation in reproductive and nonreproductive tissues., '(2) Estrogen exerts
    its biological effects on the breast in two pathways: hormone receptor-mediated
    cell-proliferation, and metabolism and catechol estrogen-mediated DNA damage.',
  "The cell proliferative effect of estrogen leading to cancers is mediated by the
    estrogen receptors, ER\u03B1 and ER\u03B2.", 'They are members of the nuclear
    steroid receptor superfamily and mediate their action by ligand-dependent binding
    as homo- or heterodimers, to the estrogen-response element of the target genes,
    resulting in their transcription regulation.', '(3, 4) Estrogens influence breast
    cancer by inducing estrogen-regulated proteins that are autocrine, paracrine,
    and intracrine growth factors.', '(5) Prolonged exposure to estrogen results in
    an increased cell proliferation that causes an increase in spontaneous DNA replication
    errors, and a mutation in the target cell would enhance the replication of clones
    that carry the genetic errors.', '(6)


    In addition, estrogens are metabolized to genotoxic metabolites which undergo
    redox cycling to generate reactive oxygen species that can damage DNA.', '(7,
    8) Estrogens are converted to metabolites and excreted from the system by the
    action of cytochrome P450s and phase II enzymes.', "Metabolism of estrogens mostly
    occurs in the liver, where estradiol is converted to the 2-hydroxy metabolite
    by CYP1A2 and the 16\u03B1-hydroxy metabolite by CYP3A4.", 'Recent studies with
    human recombinant P450s have shown that CYP1A1 and 1A2 can also produce 4-hydroxy
    metabolites, although their highest activity is for 2-hydroxylation.', '(9, 10)
    4-Hydroxylation is the major pathway in the breast as the CYP1B1 expression is
    exceptionally high in this organ.', (11) Both 2- and 4-hydroxy-estradiol generate
    free radicals through redox cycling and causes DNA damage., 'However, due to its
    relatively ready conjugation, the 2-hydroxy metabolite is rapidly removed.', 'Therefore,
    the presence of the 4-hydroxy metabolite at the target site is a critical player
    in carcinogenesis.', '(11)


    There is a growing body of evidence indicating the benefits of berry fruit consumption
    for protection from several degenerative diseases including cancer.', 'Berries
    are rich in anthocyanins, which give the characteristic blue and purple colors
    to the fruits.', (12) Studies by Stoner et al., '(13) have shown that black raspberry,
    black berry, and strawberry show a high anticarcinogenic potential against gastro-intestinal
    tumors.', "At a dose of only 5% in the diet, these berries show 30\u201360% reductions
    in all tumor indices studied.", "(13-15) Clinical studies on patients with Barett\u2019s
    esophagus consuming 30\u201345 g of lyophilized BRB per day show a significant
    reduction in the urinary biomarker for oxidative stress.", '(16) Ellagic acid,
    the key polyphenol present in BRB, is shown to modulate both phase I and phase
    II enzymes.', '(17) The anthocyanins present in berries are known to impart anticancer
    effects by induction of metabolizing enzymes, modulation of gene expression, modulation
    of cell proliferation, apoptosis, and their downstream signaling pathways.', '(18-20)


    The chemical structure of anthocyanins and ellagic acid present in berries are
    depicted in Figure 1.', These molecules have similarities in functional moiety
    suggesting a potential for SERM-like activity., (21) Both ellagic acid and berry
    anthocyanins are shown to have potent antiestrogenic activities., (22-24) Previous
    studies from our laboratory with 2.5% blueberry and BRB diets have shown protection
    against mammary tumors in rats induced by subcutaneous implantation of estrogen.,
  '(25, 26) These studies provided insights into the modulation of some of the molecular
    events involved in estrogen metabolism by the berry diets.', 'BRB in the diet
    up to a dose of 2.5% showed higher degree of protection against estrogen-mediated
    mammary carcinogenicity, compared to BB at the same dose.', 'BB and BRB have distinct
    phytochemical profiles, and a short-term study using these berries at a 5% dose
    revealed better protection from BB compared to BRB against estrogen-induced ACI
    rat mammary tissue proliferation.', 'In this study, we therefore explored the
    long-term effects of the berries supplemented in diets at 5% against estrogen-induced

    with the standard., This study was conducted to assess the protection offered
    by BB and BRB against mammary tumorigenesis when administered at 5% in the diet.,
  'The objective of this study was to compare and contrast the distinct effects of
    the two berries, determine their relative antiproliferative activity in mammary
    tissue, and correlate the distinct phytochemical signature of the two berries
    with disease prevention.', The findings were also compared with the results of
    our earlier studies with lower doses of berries and ellagic acid., 'Rats fed the
    diets containing 5% berries showed no change in body weight and diet consumption,
    suggesting that these doses are well tolerated.', It is interesting to note that
    the BRB diet delayed the first tumor appearance better than BB at the dose tested
    by nearly 15 days., BB was relatively more effective in reducing the rate of proliferation
    and tumor volume compared to BRB., 'Similarly, BB was more effective in downregulating
    CYP1A1 expression compared to BRB.', "However, BRB was more effective in downregulating
    the ER\u03B1 gene expression more effectively than BB.", Yet both the diets showed
    a similar effect in reducing the circulating estrogen levels., This highlights
    the distinct phytochemical profiles of the two berries., BB has 4-fold lower levels
    of total phenolics and 8-fold lower levels of anthocyanin content compared to
    BRB in our preparations., 'However, what make these two berries ideal candidates
    are their distinct phytochemical signatures: BB contains a diversity of anthocyanins,
    glycones of delphinidin, malvidin, cyanidin, peonidin, and petunidin, while BRB
    contains almost exclusively cyanidin glycones along with an abundant amount of
    ellagic acid.', "Thus, it appears that the anthocyanin mixture in BB is capable
    of regulating the proliferation rate of the mammary cells more effectively, while
    the ellagic acid\u2013cyanidin combination of black raspberry exerts its effect
    by delaying the neoplastic transformation.", It remains to be studied if BB might
    be more effective if the phenolic contents of both the berries are adjusted to
    the same levels., 'Alternately, other cultivars of blueberry such as Rubel, which
    have higher total anthocyanins and phenolics, can be tested instead of the Berkeley
    used in this study, which has relatively lower amounts of phenolics.', 'Considering
    that the tumor volume was not further reduced by increasing the berry dose from
    2.5% to 5%, it appears that these berries exert their major effects during the
    preinitiation/preneoplastic stages of mammary tumorigenesis by increasing the
    latency from 18 to 24 for BB and 20 to 39 for BRB and may have a lesser effect
    once the cells have become malignant.', Figure 10., 'Phytochemical profiles of
    blueberry and black raspberry: total phenolics and anthocyanidin content.', Relative
    abundance of the various anthocyanins., '(21)


    Previous studies with 1% and 2.5% BB and BRB showed BRB as having a better antiproliferative
    effect.', '(25) However, with an increase in the dose to 5%, BB appears to be
    more effective.', 'In addition, the tumor volume was more effectively reduced
    by BB compared to BRB in this study.', "Assessment of the inhibition of cell proliferation
    in vitro by either the individual anthocyanidins or a mixture of all the 5 anthocyanidins
    present in BB revealed that while 50\u2013120 \u03BCM of each of them was required
    individually to kill 50% of the T47D cells, when in mixture, less than 10 \u03BCM
    each was sufficient to achieve the same effect.", It is evident from these studies
    that the anthocyanidins of BB act synergistically and therefore supersede the
    effect of BRB at a higher dose in limiting the rate of proliferation., The anthocyanidins
    have a structural similarity in the functional moiety to estradiol and are therefore
    expected to have SERM-like properties., 'In vitro studies with anthocyanidins
    have shown a weak estrogenic activity on breast cancer cell lines and an antiestrogenic
    activity in the presence of estrogen, which was related to the number of hydroxyl
    groups present.', '(24) This explains the slight increase in proliferation in
    the mammary tissue of rats fed the berry diets alone, which was reversed in the
    presence of estrogen, at all time points in our studies.', 'While no significant
    difference was observed in the liver and mammary tissue weights of rats fed the
    BB diet at all the time points studied, it is noteworthy that the BRB diet significantly
    reduced the weight of the liver, mammary and pituitary tissues at termination.',
  One-way ANOVA revealed that BB was better in reducing the mammary weight significantly
    over time compared to BRB., 'However, the weight of the pituitary gland was most
    offset in rats fed the BB diet at both the 3-month and 7-month time-points, while
    BRB only significantly modulated at the tumor time-point.', 'Similarly, prolactin
    was better modulated by BB at all the time points than by BRB.', This also correlates
    with the profiles of circulating prolactin levels., 'As discussed previously,(27)
    prolactin secreted by the pituitary gland has a vital role in mammary tumorigenesis
    in this model, and therefore, reduction in pituitary weight and the corresponding
    prolactin levels at various time points suggest that berries are effective against
    this axis of tumor formation.', 'It is not clear, however, whether the prolactin
    levels are directly modulated by berries or whether the production of prolactin
    is reduced due to modulation in circulating estrogen levels facilitated by the
    berry diets.', Ellagic acid bioavailability was confirmed by its presence in plasma.,
  The BRB used in this study contains 0.3 mg ellagic acid/g., '(30) Therefore, at
    5% in the diet, an average of 0.15 mg of ellagic acid/ellagitannins was administered
    to these rats based on a 10 g diet intake per day.', "On the basis of 8.12 mL
    of total plasma for rats weighing 200 g,(31) detection of about 100 ng of ellagic
    acid/mL plasma in the group receiving the BRB diet alone suggests that \u22480.6%
    of ellagic acid was bioavailable in the plasma.", The plasma ellagic acid bioavailability
    in the group receiving both estrogen and BRB treatments was significantly higher.,
  'This suggests that the metabolism of ellagic acid may be altered in the presence
    of high amounts of estradiol due to the modulation or competitive inhibition by
    estrogen of the enzymes involved in the metabolism of ellagic acid, like GST,
    UGT, and ST.(32) It is noteworthy that when ACI rats were treated with estrogen
    implants and received ellagic acid via the diet at 400 ppm, the plasma ellagic
    acid levels were in the same vicinity as found in the present study in which ellagic
    acid in the BRB diet was present at only 15 ppm.', 'This suggests that the ellagic
    acid available in the plasma in this study is the cumulative amounts obtained
    as pure ellagic acid as well as from the breakdown of several ellagitannins present
    in black raspberry, implying that ellagic acid present as ellagitannins in BRB
    may have better bioavailability.', Chemoprevention studies with BRB were shown
    mostly effective in only skin(33) and gastrointestinal tract tumors., '(34) The
    lack of efficacy of ellagic acid in preventing dimethylbenzanthracene-induced
    mammary tumors even at a dose of 8,000 ppm(35) was mostly attributed to the lack
    of bioavailability at target site.', 'However, it appears that the efficacy is
    also dependent on the animal model used.', Chemopreventive agents have traditionally
    been tested against bolus doses of chemical carcinogens that are irrelevant to
    environmental exposure., 'In our study, we utilized a low-dose estrogen exposure
    model to induce mammary tumors in rats.', "The circulating estrogen levels in
    this model reach \u2248200 pg/mL, which is also relevant in humans.", It is also
    well-known that the pharmacokinetics of agents is different at higher doses when
    compared to lower doses., 'Apart from ellagic acid, we were unable to measure
    the plasma levels of other phytochemicals, particularly anthocyanins that are
    present in significant amounts.', Lower total phytochemicals but diverse anthocyanin
    content of BB showed a better protective effect compared to BRB suggesting synergistic
    activity., 'Additionally, the efficacy we observed with the two berries could
    also be the additive effects from a multitude of agents present in them than from
    a single agent.', 'When seven different types of berries with varying levels of
    anthocyanin and ellagitannin content were compared for their potency in reducing
    N-nitrosomethylbenzylamine-induced rat esophageal tumors, it was observed that
    they all showed similar effects, suggesting that the effect may be coming from
    some other components of these berries, such as carotenoinds, zeaxanthin, anthraquinones,
    etc.', '(36)


    In summary, this study has shown protective effects of berries against mammary
    tumors and has several important highlights: the rat model used circumvents most,
    if not all, of the disadvantages of traditional carcinogen models which rely on
    bolus doses of carcinogens; therefore, the translatability is enhanced; the doses
    at which berries were administered were safe and produced no toxicity; while reduction
    in tumor burden was not enhanced with 5% berry diets compared to 2.5%, the protective
    effect from BB seemed to have superseded that of the black raspberry despite 8-
    and 4-fold lower levels of anthocyanins and total phenolics, respectively; BB
    was more effective in regulating the rate of proliferation of the mammary tissue
    at a higher dose, while BRB was efficient in delaying the first tumor appearance,
    suggesting distinct molecular targets of the two berries in accordance to their
    distinct phytochemical profiles.', 'During the process of disease progression,
    the numbers of biomolecules that are abnormally expressed are limited.', 'However,
    these abnormalities increase with disease progression.', 'Therefore, targeting
    just one biomarker with one molecule often results in ineffectiveness or negative
    outcome.', '(37) On the basis of our allometric scaling calculations,(21) 1 cup
    of fresh or frozen berries a day is sufficient to provide the necessary protection
    from the carcinogenic effects of circulating estrogen.', 'This work was supported
