['The aim of this research was to study the potential anti-inflammatory activity of
    myrtle, sarsaparilla, Arabian or French lavender, and calamint along with their
    apoptotic effects on the pro-inflammatory cells, and the correlation of these
    effects with the plants potential anti-oxidant activity.', 'Myrtle extract exhibited
    the highest inhibitory activity in the paw oedema induced by carrageenan, whereas
    calamint, lavender, and sarsaparilla produced inhibitions of 49%, 38%, and 47%,
    respectively.', None of them had an effect on the TPA-induced ear oedema., 'Moreover,
    all the extracts except sarsaparilla showed different degrees of anti-oxidant
    activity.', "Lavender and myrtle at 200 \u03BCg/mL decreased cell viability by
    63% and 59%, respectively, after 3 h of incubation.", 'Neutrophil elimination
    through apoptosis could be implicated in the resolution of acute inflammation
    in the case of lavender, whereas the reduction of reactive oxygen species produced
    by neutrophils, such as the superoxide anion and the hydroxyl radical, could be
    implicated in the overall reduction of inflammation.', These results may support
    the traditional use of these plants.]
