['Dietary contribution to breast cancer risk, recurrence, and progression remains
    incompletely understood.', Increased consumption of soy and soy isoflavones is
    associated with reduced mammary cancer susceptibility in women and in rodent models
    of carcinogenesis., 'In rats treated with N-methyl-N-nitrosourea, dietary intake
    of soy protein isolate reduced mammary tumor occurrence but increased incidence
    of more invasive tumors in tumored rats, relative to the control diet casein.',
  Here we evaluated whether mammary tumor progression in tumor-bearing rats lifetime
    exposed to SPI is associated with deregulated progesterone receptor isoform expression.,
  'In histologically normal mammary glands of rats with invasive ductal carcinoma
    lesions, PR-A protein levels were higher for SPI- than casein-fed rats, whereas
    PR-B was undetectable for both groups.', "Increased mammary PR-A expression was
    associated with higher transforming growth factor-\u03B21, stanniocalcin-1, and
    CD44 transcript levels; lower E-cadherin and estrogen receptor-\u03B1 expression;
    and reduced apoptotic status in ductal epithelium.", Serum progesterone and estradiol
    levels differed with diet., 'However, sera from rats of both diet groups displayed
    comparable mammosphere-forming efficiency in human MCF-7 cells.', 'Thus, soy-rich
    diets may influence the development of more aggressive tumors by enhancing PR-A-dependent
    signaling in premalignant breast tissues.']
