['Armoracia rusticana, a member of the Brassicaceae family, has been known since ancient
    times as a folk medicinal herb and as a plant of nutritional value and culinary
    interest.', 'Currently horseradish is cultivated for its thick, fleshy and white
    roots which have a delicious intense pungency and for its tender leaves which
    are frequently used for salad mixed to other vegetables.', The traditions to use
    horseradish plant for medicinal purpose are still applied in many countries.,
  Horseradish is a rich source of a number of bioactive compounds such as glucosinolates
    and their breakdown products., Sinigrin is the dominant glucosinolate in both
    leaves and roots., 'Recent studies have shown that crude plant extracts have a
    complex profile of naturally occurring GLSs, with particular regard to sprouts.',
  'The increasing interest in these secondary metabolites, associated to the long
    and diffuse tradition of using horseradish in food preservation and as condiment
    in many parts of the world, is generating new applications of this plant in several
    agro-industrial and pharmaceutical sectors and is encouraging the use of its roots
    and leaves in functional food and medicine for human health.', 'A bibliography
    review is discussed on ethnobotanical aspects and uses of this plant, as well
    as knowledge about its flavour compounds and GLS content and composition.', This
    study summarizes also the updated information concerning the influence of the
    genotype and environment on GLS profile in horseradish., 'Brassicaceae Ethnobotany

    Horseradish, Armoracia rusticana G.', 'Gaertn., B. Mey.', 'et Scherb., is an extremely
    hardy perennial plant, member of the Brassicaeae family.', 'Its root and leaves
    have been used in antiquity as both a medicinal herb and a condiment, and the
    latter use is the principal nowadays.', 'It is currently cultivated for its thick,
    fleshy and white roots that have a mix of delicious intense pungency and cooling
    taste which is caused by sulfur compounds, namely glucosinolates.', The species
    has become naturalized in many parts of the world., 'Horseradish can be found
    in various environments including fields, home gardens, weedy areas, farmland,
    roadsides, ditches and disturbed areas throughout Europe.', 'In open fields, horseradish
    is cultivated as an annual or perennial crop.', "As annual crop it requires a
    long growing season with high temperatures during the summer and fall to enhance
    root development; as a perennial it may stay productive for 10\u201320 years or
    more, thus requiring a careful field management.", The main areas of commercial
    cultivation are found in Europe and in North America., 'In European countries,
    horseradish is especially produced in Germany, Hungary, and Poland.', 'Particularly,
    large scale productions can be found in certain regions of Germany, like Upper
    Franconia, Thuringia and the Spreewald, firstly documented in 1569.', "In the
    Serbian province of Vojvodina, the collection of wild horseradish began a long
    time ago, and the particular ecotype collected, called \u201CNovosadski\u201D,
    was highly sought after by the Austro-Hungarian Empire court thanks to its exceptional
    quality.", In Italy this plant grows in the Northern part and in the Lazio and
    Basilicata regions., 'Although the hypothesis needs to be confirmed by more detailed
    historic-botanical studies, it is probable that horseradish arrived in villages
    of inland Lucania via migrants from Swabia during the thirteenth century.', Hammer
    et al., "reported that it was possibly introduced as a traditional spice plant
    from Albania with Albanian immigrants to South Italy, where today is particularly
    diffused in the Arb\xEBresh\xEB areas of Basilicata, far away from North Italy.",
  'A. rusticana is cultivated also in Russia, the Caucasus, Asia and in some regions
    1,000 m above sea level in tropical countries.', 'In some regions of Russia, it
    may still be possible to find horseradish landraces.', 'Recently, China has also
    begun commercial production of horseradish, although much of the crop is produced
    by small farmers.', In this review we first present a botanical description of
    A. rusticana and its traditional uses in food and medical fields due to its peculiar
    chemical composition., 'Afterwards, we review knowledge on flavour constituents
    and profile, concentration and chemical form of GLSs and their breakdown products
    in roots and leaves.', This review also stresses the influence of the genetic
    variability and agronomic management on GLS content and composition of horseradish
    plants., Horseradish has well defined botanical characteristics which clearly
    separate the species from other Brassicaceae., Various Latin names have been used
    in the course of time by several authors for this species., 'Taxonomically, horseradish
    has been placed in various genera by different botanists.', 'In 1969, Courter
    and Rhodes have recorded the names for classification of horseradish during three
    historical periods, as shown in Table 1.', 'It was classified as Nasturtium armoracia
    Fries, Roripa armoracia Hitchc., Radicula armoracia Robinson, Cochlearia armoracia
    L., Armoracia armoracia Britton, and A. rusticana Gaertn..', 'Specific epithets
    used were rivini, rusticana, armoracia or lapathifolia.', 'Although A. lapathifolia
    is favored by some taxonomists, Lawrence and Fosberg have pointed out that A.
    rusticana should have preference.', 'The first valid published scientific name
    of horseradish which resulted from the generic name Armoracia was A. rusticana
    in 1800 by Gaertner, Meyer, and Scherbius: this binomial is used today.', Even
    more complex is the variety of common names used to designate this species whose
    polynomial is due to different languages and dialectical differentiation in different
    territories., Horseradish has its gene center in Eastern Europe and the south
    western parts of Russia., 'In fact, early records indicate that horseradish is
    a native of the temperate regions of Eastern Europe and western Asia, where wild
    types are found growing from Finland and Poland to the regions around the Caspian
    Sea and the desert of Cumania and Turkey.', 'From here, horseradish spread to
    Western Europe and across the Atlantic to the New World by early settlers.', 'Today,
    horseradish has become naturalized in many parts of the world and can be found
    both cultivated and growing wild.', 'According to De Candolle the most probable
    place of origin of A. rusticana was the temperate region of Eastern Europe because
    of the word chren, common in Slavic languages which was the most primitive name
    for horseradish.', 'Chren was introduced into German and French dialects in the
    forms of kren, kreen, cran and cranson.', 'Meerretig, meer-radys and meridi, which
    literally mean sea-radish, are other words for horseradish that are common in
    several western European languages, but these words are less primitive than the
    name chren.', 'The names horseradish in English, raifort in French, and pepperrot
    in Swedish are also of more recent origin than chren.', The first use of the term
    horse radish was made by John Gerard in his famous English herbal that contains
    a lengthy entry with a woodcut and clear description of the plant., "Some believe
    that the English called the plant horseradish in reference to its propensity to
    rapidly spread in a \u2018galloping\u2019 behavior.", It is also possible that
    it was called harsh radish because it was so bitter on the tongue., "The word
    armoracia has been commonly used as a generic name or specific epithet: Armoracia
    is formed from the Celtic: ar \u2018near\u2019, mor \u2018the sea\u2019, rich
    \u2018against\u2019, viz., a plant growing near the sea.", 'Armoracia belongs
    to the Cardamineae, which comprise 10 genera and more than 340 species that grow
    in moist habitats.', The three species within the genus have an affinity for wet
    habitats and commonly spread through rhizomes., Brzezinski believes that horseradish
    is not a natural species but a hybrid., 'Sampliner and Miller hypothesized that
    A. rusticana is a species known only from cultivation, and that cultivated A.
    rusticana populations were derived from natural populations of either A. macrocarpa
    or A. sisymbrioides.', 'Horseradish is a large-leaved, hardy, and glabrous perennial
    herb that grows to a height of up to 120 cm.', Cauline leaves vary in shape and
    margin depending on the habitat in which they are growing., 'The leaves are long-petioled,
    oblong-ovate, cordate at the base, unevenly crenate, and they grow to a length
    of 30 cm up to 100 cm..', 'Moreover, cultivars with an acute leaf-base have smooth
    leaves, while those with a cordate leaf-base have crinkled leaves; some genotypes
    have intermediate leaf-types.', 'The leaves on stalk are smaller in size, have
    narrow bases and mostly sessile, are alternate, lanceolate, and unevenly serrate
    to entire-margined.', 'It is interesting to note, as reported by Shehata et al.,
    that horseradish leaf morphology varies through the season from entire in the
    summer to divided in the fall; intermediate types of leaves are visible throughout
    the season.', The same authors have shown in their work a photo with the different
    types of leaves., The unstable leaf morphology of horseradish is of considerable
    interest to botanists., 'In general, the change from entire to pinnate in most
    obvious in the fall as plants approach dormancy, suggesting environmental influence.',
  Armoracia rusticana plant grown in Basilicata Region., 'Personal photo


    The plant may or may not form a flower stalk depending on environmental conditions.',
  'In natural habitats, horseradish blooms very profusely and for a long period of
    time, until mid-August.', Shehata et al., "reported that A. rusticana produces
    numerous fragrant flowers with 5\u20137 cm long upright pedicels borne on racemes
    that have four sepals, four petals, and six tetradynamous stamens: their sepals
    are 2.5\u20133 mm long, broadly ovate and have membranous white margins; petals
    are white, 5\u20137 mm long, and broadly obovate; the inner stamens are 2.5 mm
    long and the outer ones are 1.5 mm long; the stigma is broad, round, and gently
    two-lobed.", "Horseradish bears 4\u20136 mm long, globose to obovate siliques
    with persistent style on 20 mm long, upright-spreading stems.", 'A. rusticana
    produces few if any seeds, usually none, at most 6 seeds per pod.', The seeds
    are smooth and brown when mature., 'Winiarczyk and Bednara observed that, a dozen
    or so days after the fall of the perianth of the inflorescence, siliques started
    to form: most of the flowers were withered, but on every inflorescence, there
    were a few dozen fruits, the majority of which, however, were shriveled and deformed;
    in every silique, most of the ovules were aborted, some were much smaller and
    deformed, but sporadically there were also large, properly developed young seeds.',
  'As a matter of fact, many early botanists reported that horseradish rarely produced
    viable seed and, until the early part of the twentieth century, the plant was
    considered to be highly sterile.', Weber observed partial pairing of chromosomes
    and other irregularities during both microsporogenesis and megasporogenesis.,
  'Winiarczyk and Bednara noted on the stigma of A. rusticana morphological symptoms
    of the reaction of self-incompatibility, typical for some species of the Brassicacea
    family.', This could explain the fact that most A. rusticana plants are incapable
    of producing viable seeds., 'In addition, the plants growing in a given area,
    i.e.', 'constituting a certain population, are often genetically identical with
    the parent plant, as a consequence of their vegetative reproduction.', "In fact,
    horseradish is asexually propagated by planting root sections collected from the
    previous year\u2019s crop through the formation of adventitious buds.", "In particular,
    lateral roots are separated from the healthy taproots for next year\u2019s planting
    stock.", "The root system of horseradish consists of a long, white, cylindrical
    or tapering main root that can grow to about 60 cm in loose soils; several thin
    lateral roots are formed around the main root and near the collar of the crown;
    undisturbed, the root system can reach a depth of 3\u20134 m with a lateral spread
    of about 1 m. Horseradish roots exhibit distinct polarity with a proximal end
    and distal end.", 'Typical silique of a horseradish plant 2-year-old: a Fruits-silique

    of seeds in silique.', "Images captured with stereo microscope at \xD76.3 by a
    camera Olympus 8 Megapixel.", The bar in Fig., '2b is 2 mm


    According to Sampliner and Miller the clonal propagation of A. rusticana may have
    resulted in increased sterility due to the accumulation of deleterious mutations
    in gene regions associated with seed production; reproduction of sterile individuals
    derived from an interspecific hybridization; or self-incompatibility mechanisms
    precluding fertilization between widespread, genetically-identical plants.', 'Furthermore,
    research aimed at obtaining horseradish plants capable of sexual reproduction
    could result in better adaptation to various environmental conditions and pest
    resistance.', The use of horseradish as food or folk medicinal plant has spread
    from the Eastern and Mediterranean areas both north- and westward during the Middle
    Ages., It is believed that horseradish became popular as a condiment in old Europe
    because there was no refrigeration and its sharp spiciness covered the taste of
    tainted meat., 'In Bulgaria, Romania and Russia, the whole root, grated root,
    or piece of cut root are still used to flavour, help ferment, aerate pickling
    liquid, and conserve cabbage for the winter; leaves were also cut and used to
    conserve cut vegetables for the winter.', Horseradish was used by European Jews
    as a symbolic food in the ritual meal as bitter herb of Passover because its bitterness
    remembered the suffering of their ancestors of the exodus from Egypt., 'By the
    late 1600s the English people added horseradish to beef and oysters, and particularly
    in spring, the tender leaves frequently were used for greens mixed with other
    wild plants; for Germans, horseradish roots were an excellent addition to meat
    and fish when cut in very small pieces, then crushed and mixed with salt and vinegar.',
  These latter authors wrote that horseradish was also mixed in catsup used to flavour
    ground beets or added to mustard as a seasoning., 'As reported by Shehata et al.,
    horseradish was often consumed boiled as a pot herb; it was boiled, the water
    was drained, and it was boiled a second time to eliminate bitter or harmful substances
    before consumption.', The main portions of this plant are still used today to
    prepare traditional dishes in many countries around the world., 'In Poland, roots
    and leaves are used for seasoning or as preservatives: the roots, usually collected
    from the wild plants, were utilized as a condiment, with pickled cucumbers, grated
    with chopped boiled eggs, soups or meat dishes, often used at Easter.', 'The leaves
    placed in the oven under baking bread, partly to prevent the bread from sticking
    and partly to flavour the bread, are still widely used.', 'In Bulgaria, Romania
    and Russia, grated roots are used as a condiment for any cooked meat; they are
    often combined with vinegar, salt, oil, cream, or yogurt.', 'Particularly, in
    Romania, grated roots, with or without oil, are eaten with potatoes or polenta,
    or are grilled and eaten with cream accompanying lamb and chicken; a mix of grated
    horseradish, apples, salt, sugar, and vinegar is a garnish used for meals; small
    pieces of cut A. rusticana root are eaten in soups; leaves can also be put into
    bread dough, which is then grilled.', 'In South Italy there are many traditional
    culinary uses, particularly, in the Basilicata area this plant is typical base
    for preparing dishes during the carnival period: horseradish is grated as condiment
    for pasta or home-made noodles, and it is used in fried eggs paste to prepare
    a traditional dish during the carnival period; pieces of roots are also used for
    aromatization of hand-made sausages; it is used raw grated as condiment for cooked
    pork meat or for lamb and chicken where the pieces of roots are often combined
    with oil, salt and vinegar; the leaves are used for salad, mixed to other vegetable
    species.', 'Grated roots are often combined with oil and used all year round,
    also smeared on grilled bread.', 'The root is still popular in Europe and North
    America and is appreciated freshly grated, mixed with vinegar or in a sauce to
    form a condiment often used with meats or fish and as a flavour in other recipes
    in salads and soups, on sandwiches, and also in drinks such as the Bloody Mary.',
  'In addition to be used as food and condiment, horseradish has a long history of
    utilization for medicinal purposes in the traditional medicine.', "In a recent
    review, Wedelsb\xE4ck Bladh and Olsson have well documented the historical uses
    of horseradish as a medicinal plant in different parts of the world, and have
    shown also a table with the different uses in various historical periods.", Since
    the ancient Greeks horseradish was used as an aphrodisiac and as a rub to alleviate
    pain in the back., "Material medica\u2019s of ancient physician and the herbal
    of early botanists record many medical virtues of horseradish.", "Early records,
    believed to be about horseradish are found in \u201CNaturalis Historia\u201D by
    the Roman naturalist and philosopher Gajus Plinius Secundus that recommended the
    plant freshly grated for the digestion after a heavy meal, and in \u201CDe Materia
    Medica\u201D by the Greek physician Pedanius Dioscorides that described the plant
    as a diuretic and very hot herb.", 'Hildegard of Bingen, a German abbess, in her
    book about medicinal plants, recommended horseradish mixed with warm vine or water
    as a treatment for lung diseases; to cure heartache or heart diseases, dry and
    pulverized horseradish could be mixed with Alpinia galanga, a Chinese herb often
    used as a stimulant and drug.', 'In 1597, the botanist and herbalist John Gerard
    claimed that horseradish reduced pain from sciatica, relieved colic, increased
    urination, and killed worms in children.', 'It was stated to be an expectorant,
    soothing for respiratory problems, and may help to relieve rheumatism by stimulating
    blood flow to inflamed joints.', 'The most common use of horseradish was as a
    remedy for scurvy, as also recommended by herbalist William Coles, especially
    for seamen on long voyages that had not access to fresh vegetables or fruit, so
    the lack of vitamin C in the diet often caused scurvy outbreaks on board.', 'In
    1880, Bentley and Trimen reported that grated horseradish root was used mixed
    with honey and warm water for influenza, and it could be used as poultice by adding
    cornstarch to fresh horseradish and applying it to the affected areas in a gauze
    bandage.', 'Native Americans used horseradish to treat toothaches, as a urinary
    aid for gravel, as a diuretic, as a gastrointestinal aid to improve digestion,
    and as a respiratory aid to treat asthma, cough, and bronchitis.', 'The tradition
    to use the plant for medicinal purpose is still applied in countries like Bulgaria,
    Romania, and some part of Russia: grated roots or leaves are put in a cloth and
    applied to the skin to ease pain, or a paste made from the root is applied to
    the throat to ease breathing problems.', 'Mixtures with honey from Robinia pseudoacacia
    are used for coughs and bronchitis, while in combination with vinegar, salt, and
    sugar it is used for lowering blood pressure.', "Furthermore, in an ethnobotanical
    study about a community of Russlanddeutsche living in K\xFCnzelsau, it was reported
    that Russian sauerkraut, used as an important home medicine for treating flu and
    liver disease, contained among other herbs, also horseradish leaves.", 'In the
    Basilicata region, horseradish leaves and roots have been traditionally used as
    a remedy for rheumatism, headaches, sinuses, coughs and bronchitis.', 'Added to
    water, vinegar, salt, sugar, or aromatised with Anethum graveolens and Laurus
    nobilis leaves, this plant is also used as a remedy for healing drunkenness.',
  'Particularly, in Castelmezzano, the Ukrainian women have introduced the functional
    use of pickled tomatoes, consumed to recover from a drunken state.', 'Leaves,
    added to dog food, are used because of their antimicrobial activity.', "Also,
    according to Wedelsb\xE4ck Bladh and Olsson, the traditional knowledge of using
    horseradish in food preservation at home is generating new applications for the
    plant as a natural anti-bacterial component in food and the new knowledge of bioactive
    components such as GLSs and their breakdown products, combined with traditional
    knowledge of medicinal properties, is encouraging the use of horseradish roots
    and leaves in functional food and medicine to inhibit different cancer forms or
    gastric lesions.", 'Horseradish tissues, when unbroken, are inodorous.', 'The
    intense pungent aroma and the lachrymatory odour of horseradish results from crushing,
    grinding, or chewing the cells and therefore it is specially cultivated to supply
    a hot spicy flavour.', The characteristic taste and odour is due to compounds
    such as GLSs and their mostly volatile breakdown products., 'GLSs are hydrolysed
    by the enzyme commonly known as myrosinase to a variety of compounds as isothiocyanates,
    nitriles, thiocyanates, epithionitriles, and oxazolidines.', The most common products
    are isothiocyanates., 'GLSs are compounds mainly found in plants belonging to
    the order of Capparales, with particular reference to several species of the Brassicacee
    family including horseradish.', 'These secondary metabolites are characterized
    by a core sulfated isothiocyanate group, which is conjugated to thioglucose, and
    a further R-group derived from amino acids.', 'GLSs can be divided into three
    classes based on the structure of different amino acid precursors: aliphatic GLSs
    derived from methionine, isoleucine, leucine or valine; aromatic GLSs derived
    from phenylalanine or tyrosine; and indole GLSs derived from tryptophan.', The
    number of reported GLSs is now approaching 200., "A number of plants contain only
    a single GLS, the majority contain 2\u20135, while 34 individual GLSs are reported
    in the seeds and leaves of a collection of ecotypes of Arabidopsis thaliana.",
  'GLS concentrations in plants, although highly variable, are around 1 % of dry weight
    in some Brassica vegetables.', The GLS content is higher in black mustard seed
    and horseradish roots than in the other constituent parts of the Brassicaceae.,
  'However, very little is known about the concentration and biochemical composition
    of horseradish, especially the distribution of GLSs in the different organs of
    the plants.', "A first study about the identification of GLSs of horseradish roots
    by GC\u2013MS was published by Grob and Matile.", They identified 30 GLSs which
    exceeds the number of GLSs detected before in any other species., 'The authors
    reported that a close examination of the chromatograms may indicate that the number
    of structures present in horseradish may be even larger, although today it is
    necessary to investigate and confirm all individual molecules listed by Grob and
    Matile.', Several methods have been developed to detect either intact GLSs or
    their desulfoglucosinolates., "Glucosinolates of horseradish roots as identified
    by their corresponding mustard oils and odour description  \n\n\nThe common names
    are those generally accepted\n\n\n\nThe structural identity of GLSs is known and
    described only for those which can be isolated and identified by traditional methods.",
  'With increasing complexity of GLS composition and decreasing concentration of individual
    GLSs in the sample, more sensitive and selective analytical methods are required
    for their identification.', 'Hence, for their accurate structural identification,
    in addition to traditional methods, sensitive and selective analytical methods
    are required, especially when GLSs are present in trace amounts only.', Mevy et
    al., investigated the occurrence of GLSs in various differentiated horseradish
    tissues by HPLC analysis of desulphoglucosinolates., 'Particularly, the individual
    GLSs present in regenerated plantlets were compared with those of embryoids, suspension
    cells and calli in order to investigate whether the distribution of these compounds
    resulted from cellular differentiation.', 'Moreover, the authors revealed the
    presence of two GLSs, i.e.', '2-phenylethyl- and 2-propenyl-, which appeared to
    be confined to roots and leaves, respectively, while the highest content of indole-3-methyl-GLS
    was found in calli.', 'Their data clearly demonstrated that the occurrence of
    indole GLSs in embryoids, suspensions cells and calli relates to their age.',
  'It has also been reported that younger and growing tissues synthesize more indole
    GLSs than older and senescent tissue, so their results raise the question of the
    role of GLSs in healthy plants.', 'Mevy et al., by comparison of immobilized and
    suspension cells of horseradish, showed that GLS production may be improved by
    cell immobilization technique.', 'Moreover, the chromatograms obtained revealed
    that glucobrassicin occurred earlier than its hydroxylated form in cells, therefore
    their data suggest that hydroxyglucobrassicin might result directly from modification
    of the side chain of glucobrassicin.', 'aMurashige and Skoog basal salts with

    Redovnikovic et al.', analyzed horseradish plantlets leaves by reversed-phase
    high-performance liquid chromatography analysis of desulphoglucosinolates and
    showed that the aliphatic GLS 2-propenyl-GLS accounted for more than 80 % of total
    GLSs., 'Lower amounts of phenylethyl-GLS and of the three indole compounds 3-indolylmethyl-GLS,
    4-methoxy-3-indolylmethyl-GLS and 4-hydroxy-3-indolylmethyl-GLS were found.',
  Li and Kushad evaluated roots from 27 horseradish accessions and leaves from 9 accessions
    for their GLS content by RP-HPLC as desulphoglucosinolates., "In roots, total
    GLS concentration ranged from 2 to 296 \u03BCmol g\u22121 of dry weight, with
    sinigrin representing on average 83 % of the total GLSs, followed by gluconasturtiin
    with 11 %, and glucobrassicin with 1 %.", 'In some of the accessions, other GLSs
    as progoitrin, gluconapin, 4-hydroxyglucobrassicin, and 4-methoxyglucobrassicin,
    were detected in minor concentrations.', 'According to the same authors, the origin
    of plant did not seem to have an effect on total GLSs level; furthermore, the
    average total GLS concentration in most horseradish roots accessions was similar
    to the value for brown and oriental mustard seeds, but significantly higher than
    what the authors had previously reported for broccoli, brussels sprouts, cabbage,
    cauliflower, or kale.', "The total GLS levels in the leaves, instead, ranged from
    34 to 201 \u03BCmol g\u22121 of DW.", 'Similar to the roots, sinigrin was the
    dominant GLSs in the leaves, representing on average 92 % of the total.', 'Leaves
    also contained gluconasturtiin, but at a much lower concentration than in roots.',
  'Conversely, leaf tissues contained neoglucobrassicin instead of glucobrassicin.',
  'Recently, Alnsour et al., referring to the GLS content, confirmed previous results
    of Redovnikovic et al.', and Mevy et al., showing that the overall GLS concentration
    in the in vitro cultivated Armoracia plants is much lower than that found by Li
    and Kushad in soil-grown ones., 'Surprisingly, in contrast to soil grown plants,
    where the GLS concentration in roots and leaves were quite similar, in the in
    vitro plantlets the concentration of GLS in the root was much lower than in the
    leaves.', 'The distribution of the GLSs varies among plant organs, with both quantitative
    and qualitative differences between roots, leaves, stems and seeds; in any case
    the plant age is a major determinant of the qualitative and quantitative GLS composition
    in the plants.', 'Li and Kushad reported differences in GLS content between young
    and fully developed roots and leaves of horseradish, noting that the major differences
    were observed regarding indole GLSs, in fact the younger tissue of roots and leaves
    tended to accumulate more glucobrassicin and neoglucobrassicin, respectively,
    than fully developed organs.', 'Due to the complexity of this vegetal matrix,
    further studies are required to better understand the accumulation of various
    GLSs during different growth stages also by comparing of different genotypes.',
  'For the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, a member of the Brassicaceae, it was
    reported that GLS accumulation varies significantly among different organs and
    developmental stages, with regards to both composition and concentration.', 'Particularly,
    dormant and germinating seeds had the highest concentration; inflorescences and
    siliques had the next highest levels followed by roots, stems and cauline leaves,
    and rosette leaves.', 'The GLSs are plant defense compounds that accumulate preferentially
    in the reproductive organs as seeds, flowers, fruits and young sprouts.', The
    low GLS concentration in the leaves and stems in comparison with the seeds could
    be attributed to the dilution of GLSs during plant growth., 'Recently, Agneta
    et al.', gave a complex profile of naturally occurring intact GLSs in sprouts
    and roots of a horseradish accession largely diffused in southern Italy by using
    reversed-phase liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization and
    a hybrid quadrupole linear ion trap and Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance
    mass spectrometry., In sprouts 16 and in roots 11 GLSs were identified., 'The
    authors confirmed the presence of sinigrin, 4-hydroxyglucobrassicin, glucobrassicin,
    gluconasturtiin, and 4-methoxyglucobrassicin and identified glucoiberin, gluconapin,
    glucocochlearin, glucoconringianin, glucosativin, glucoibarin, 5-hydroxyglucobrassicin,
    glucocapparilinearisin or glucobrassicanapin, glucotropaeolin, and glucoarabishirsutain,
    not previously characterized in horseradish.', 'Particularly notable was the presence
    of the putative 2-methylsulfonyl-oxo-ethyl-GLS, not reported before.', 'In addition,
    horseradish sprouts were found to be richer in GLSs than roots.', Further studies
    are required to quantify the content of these molecules that are responsible for
    the typical flavour of this plant., "Change in total, individual and residual
    glucosinolates in two accession of horseradish roots and leaves as a function
    of growth stage  \n\n\n\naTotal glucosinolates in roots and leaves represent the
    sum of sinigrin, glucobrassicin, and gluconasturtiin plus residual glucosinolates
    and the sum of sinigrin, neoglucobrassicin and gluconasturtiin plus residual glucosinolates,
    respectively\n\n\ncValues represent the means of four replicates per accession.",
  "Mean separation within each column by Duncan\u2019s multiple-range test, P = 0.05\n\n\nGlucosinolates

    the components that cause the intense pungency are physically separated from one
    another.", GLSs are stored in the vacuole while the myrosinase enzyme that causes
    their degradation is confined within specialized cells known as myrosin cells.,
  Upon crushing horseradish roots or leaves allyl and 2-phenylethyl isothiocyanate
    are produced from sinigrin and 2-phenylethyl-GLS., 'Allyl isothiocyanate is reported
    to be a lachrymatory compound, bitter in taste with a strong, pungent smell, while
    2-phenylethyl isothiocyanate had no pungency and lachrymatory role at all, like
    allyl isothiocyanate.', 'Both isothiocyanates are largely responsible for the
    typical, characteristic flavour and pungency in mustard as well as in horseradish.',
  "Recently, eighteen compounds that contribute to the flavour of horseradish were
    identified in roots immediately after harvesting by D\u2019Auria et al., using
    SPME\u2013GC\u2013MS.", 'The main compounds were allyl isothiocyanate, 4-isothiocyanato-1-butene,
    and 2 phenylethyl isothiocyanate.', Allyl isothiocyanate was the largest peak
    in the chromatogram and accounted for 81 % of the overall integrated peak area.,
  'It is noteworthy that methyl, ethyl, and isopropyl isothiocyanate were not found.',
  "By the same authors the different volatile organic compounds listed in Table 6
    were identified in cut horseradish kept at 5 \xB0C for 12 h. The concentration
    of most of the volatile compounds declined rapidly and 2-phenylethyl isothiocyanate
    compounds became the most abundant compound.", The fact that the flavour composition
    of cut horseradish samples changes is relevant when specifying the treatment of
    horseradish to obtain mustard., "Volatile organic compounds found in the fresh
    horseradish root and in the cut of roots kept at 5 \xB0C for 12 h  \n\n\n\nTo
    preserve the pungency and quality, the ground product should be consumed quickly
    or refrigerated to minimize loss of volatile flavour compounds.", 'However, ground
    horseradish slowly losses its pungency, becomes dark, and develops off flavours
    even under refrigeration; this quality loss can be slowed by adding a fat or oil,
    such as cream.', Kosson and Horbowicz showed that higher storage temperature caused
    faster decline of isothiocyanates concentration in horseradish cream., 'Therefore,
    to maintain the human health-promoting compounds in processed horseradish, the
    authors suggested storing horseradish cream under cold conditions.', 'Furthermore,
    also dehydrated horseradish in diced, flaked or powder form has a great potential
    as a flavour ingredient in sauces, dressings, and seasoning formulations.', "Sahasrabudhe
    and Mullin recommended that in processing horseradish to a dried product, one
    must process the cleaned roots immediately after dicing or crushing and maintain
    the temperature below 65 \xB0C, to retain viability of the myrosinase to obtain
    a product with the desired flavour intensity and acceptable color.", "In addition,
    Sahasrabudhe and Mullin evaluated the odour intensity of the powders by sniffing,
    after adding water: they noted that freeze dried samples and samples processed
    at 65 \xB0C had the same odor intensity as fresh samples while samples processed
    at 90 \xB0C lacked odor, as a consequence of deactivation of myrosinase at temperatures
    higher than 70 \xB0C.", 'Further investigations are required to quantify the content
    of the molecules that are responsible for the typical flavour, which is one of
    the main characteristics for making a high-quality product and to achieve a high
    marketable yield, as requested by the agro-industrial and pharmaceutical sectors.',
  'When plant tissue is disrupted or crushed, myrosinase hydrolyzes GLSs to variety
    of molecules.', 'These products, especially isothiocyanates, are reported to have
    biological activities including anticarcinogenic activity.', 'GLSs and their breakdown
    products may act as inhibitors of microbial growth, deterrents for herbivores,
    and as attractants of specialist insects; moreover, these secondary metabolites
    suppress soil-borne organisms such as bacteria, fungi, viruses, nematodes and
    weeds.', 'Particularly, the activity of isothiocyanates such as sulforaphane against
    numerous human pathogens could contribute to the medicinal properties ascribed
    to Brassicaceae vegetables, such as cabbage and mustard, which have been used
    as wound poultices and antitumor agents for centuries.', More recent interest
    has been focussed on the potential anticarcinogenic activity of GLS degradation
    products., 'The reason of this increasing interest is due to the strong correlation
    found between the consumption of Brassicaceae vegetables and the decreased risk
    for pancreas, lung, stomach, prostate, and breast cancer, as recently reported
    by Velasco et al..', 'Particularly, several studies have shown that allyl isothiocyanate
    may inhibit different kinds of human prostate cancer or could contribute to the
    lower incidence of bladder cancer.', Horseradish contains more than 10 times as
    much GLSs as broccoli., 'The high levels of sinigrin in horseradish, easily hydrolyzed
    by myrosinase to allyl isothiocyanate when the roots are crushed, makes this root
    interesting as a possible cancer-protecting component in the diet.', 'As reported
    by Shehata et al., some German studies have investigated the effects of horseradish
    on nonspecific urinary tract infections and the antibacterial action of its essential
    oils.', 'A preparation with horseradish containing sinigrin or allyl isothiocyanate
    was patented in 1995 for topical application as a spray or applied with a swab
    onto the affected mucosa, for treatment of nasal and sinus dysfunction.', Horseradish
    has been approved in Germany for the treatment of infections of the respiratory
    tract and as supportive treatment in urinary tract infections., "In the United
    States, the root is the active ingredient of Rasapen \xAE, a urinary antiseptic
    drug.", 'Recently, reported health benefits of horseradish and its constituents
    include plasma cholesterol reduction in mice, tumor cell proliferation and cyclooxygenase
    activity prevention, as well as an antimicrobial effect on Vibrio parahaemolyticus
    by horseradish extract.', Matsuda et al., showed that allyl isothiocyanate provided
    significant protection against ethanol-induced gastric lesions., Majewska et al.,
  'have evaluated some antioxidant properties of leaf and root extracts and mustard
    oil from four different types of horseradish growing under different environmental
    conditions: although leaf and root extracts did not exhibit strong antioxidant
    properties, the different environmental conditions affected these properties significantly;
    also, volatile oil obtained from horseradish roots revealed stronger antioxidant
    properties than pure allyl isothiocyanate.', According to Mari et al., 'allyl
    isothiocyanate, a naturally occurring flavour compound in mustard and horseradish,
    has a well-documented antimicrobial activity, therefore this volatile substance
    can be employed successfully in modified atmosphere packaging or as a gaseous
    treatment before storage.', 'Also, horseradish distillate is a potentially useful
    antimicrobial adjunct in packaged, refrigerated precooked meats, in fact, essential
    oils of Brassicaceae plants, including horseradish, have long been known to possess
    antibacterial activity versus pathogenic bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus,
    Escherichia coli and Serratia grimesii.', Khomvilai et al., 'observed the fungicidal
    activities of allyl isothiocyanate against Saprolegnia parasitica, a fish-pathogen
    oomycete, and determined both minimum inhibitory concentration for mycelia growth
    and zoospore germination.', 'Recently, first results of antifungal tests demonstrated
    that horseradish ethanol extracts also present a fungistatic activity against
    Sclerotium rolfsii Sacc., Fusarium oxysporum Schlecht and Fusarium culmorum Sacc..',
  'Moreover, Park et al.', 'have tested essential oils from 40 plant species for their
    insecticidal activities against larvae of Lycoriella ingenue using a fumigation
    bioassay: horseradish showed the most potent insecticidal activity among the plant
    essential oils the most toxic compound to L. ingenue was allyl isothiocyanate.',
  'In addition, also the results obtained by Wu et al.', 'suggest good insecticidal
    efficacy of allyl isothiocyanate obtained from A. rusticana as alternative fumigant
    against four major pest species of stored products, maize weevil Sitophilus zeamais,
    lesser grain borer Rhizopertha dominica, Tribolium ferrugineum and book louse
    Liposcelis entomophila.', 'Furthermore, interesting and significant insecticidal
    activity against larvae of Aedes albopictus was obtained by using horseradish
    extract prepared from fresh plants in a solution of ethanol 80 %.', 'Recently,
    Chen et al.', have assessed the fumigant toxicity of essential oil from horseradish
    against Plodia interpunctella and Sitophilus zeamais Motschulsky., The essential
    oil of A. rusticana showed fumigant bioactivity against all stages of P. interpunctella
    and adults of S. zeamais., "It caused high mortality of all stages of P. interpunctella
    when exposed to 32 \u03BCl/l gas vapour of A. rusticana.", "The oil appeared not
    to have much impact on the adults of S. zeamais when the gas vapour was lower
    than 16 \u03BCl/l, however, at 32 \u03BCl/l, the percentage mortality was 100
    %.", "GC\u2013MS showed that the main component of the essential oil from A. rusticana
    was allyl isothiocyanate.", Armoracia rusticana oil or its major constituents
    could be efficient fumigants and also could be integrated with other pest management
    procedures., 'For the practical use of horseradish oil and their constituents
    as novel fumigants, further study is necessary on the safety of these materials
    to humans and on development of formulation to improve efficacy and stability,
    and to reduce cost.', 'Although higher concentrations of these natural anti-fungal
    and insecticidal products should be used, their intrinsically low toxicity towards
    humans makes them an interesting alternative to current chemicals.', All these
    researches demonstrated that horseradish extracts could be promising alternatives
    to synthetic agrochemical products although more work is needed., Another suggested
    use for horseradish includes weed suppression via the allelopathic response of
    GLSs in soil., 'GLSs and their byproducts can act as biofumigants when used as
    green manure, thus showing potential for weed control in organic production.',
  The GLS content and composition in planta can be strongly influenced by genotype
    and environment., 'The genetic variability may play a primary role in determining
    the amount of functional metabolites, such as GLSs.', Only few studies have investigated
    GLS variation within different horseradish genotypes., 'Among these, Li and Kushad
    have evaluated the GLS levels in root and leaf samples of horseradish accessions
    of a germplasm collection of the Vegetable Research Farm, University of Illinois,
    Urbana-Champaign, IL.', They found that GLS content varied widely among all accessions.,
  "According to Faltusov\xE1 et al., genotypes with high GLS contents will be further
    utilized as a potential genetic source for breeding.", 'To date, information on
    genetic diversity between different accessions of horseradish, are scarce.', 'Although
    molecular marker analyses are successfully used for characterization of genetic
    resources of many species, bio-agronomic characterization is the first step for
    the description and classification of germplasm.', Rhodes et al., 'have classified
    20 genotypes of horseradish, grown at the University of Illinois Horticultural
    Farm, chosen from a gene pool containing over 400 genotypes cultivars to represent
    the extreme and intermediate forms of morphological variability found in horseradish.',
  Two methods of classification were compared., One classification was based on 2
    highly diagnostic characters that showed the extreme and intermediate limits of
    the germplasm in form of a scatter plot., The other classification was based on
    40 characters., 'For this last classification, methods of numerical taxonomy were
    used to show the germplasm diversity by scatter diagrams and phenograms.', 'The
    two classifications appeared to be equal in defining the extreme limits of the
    genetic variability, although minor differences were found among the relative
    positions of some genotypes.', Sarli et al., 'have recorded and statistically
    analyzed data regarding the variation of 26 morphological descriptors by using
    modified UPOV guidelines for performing tests for distinctness, uniformity and
    stability for horseradish.', 'In this study morphological traits of 30 horseradish
    accessions from Basilicata region were characterized and compared to two European
    genotypes: the resulting cluster displayed four major groups of genotypes, on
    the base of the characteristics of rhizome and leaves.', The results showed a
    significant degree of variability among accessions., 'Also, the results of univariate
    and multivariate analysis showed that the investigated accessions cannot be clearly
    separated according to their place of origin, assuming that a distribution of
    an accession is facilitated by territorial continuity and similarity.', 'According
    to Sarli et al., this preliminary screening of a horseradish germplasm collection
    is quite useful to perform future programs of conservation in situ and ex situ,
    in order to expand and improve the cultivation of A. rusticana.', 'In any case,
    there is a lack of basic biological and genetic information about horseradish.',
  'The first studies, as reported above, could be a good starting point to develop
    methods to measure genetic diversity in different accessions of horseradish.',
  'The genetic relationships among cultivars, breeding lines, and wild accessions
    need to be determined, so that the greatest possible gain can be made in specific
    crosses.', 'Until today, only few studies were performed on the characterization
    of genetic diversity of horseradish.', Various molecular marker systems applied
    in plants belonging to the Brassicaceae family may be useful for a first detection
    of polymorphisms in this species., 'However, the morphological and genetic variation
    that seems to exist among different horseradish accessions could be compared with
    the GLS content of various horseradish accessions for developing improved cultivars.',
  'In fact, there is a growing interest in the metabolic engineering of plants for
    the production of high-value bioactive compounds, because the availability of
    phytochemicals in their natural sources is often limited.', Therefore the information
    on genetic diversity could be utilized in order to identify genotypes with desirable
    traits for future breeding programs., There are even less studies on the effects
    of environment and cultivation techniques on yield and GLS content of this plant.,
  Some researchers have demonstrated that GLS profile can be manipulated by cultural
    management., 'About the crop management, fertilization have been shown to significantly
    affect GLS concentration in plant, particularly sulphur and nitrogen, but some
    controversy still exists on such effects.', Horseradish is a crop that needs a
    lot of nutrients., Its powerful root system drains large amounts of soil moisture
    and nutrient reserves., 'However, until today, there is little information about
    the GLS content in relation to S and N fertilization, with particular regard to
    sprouts, young leaves and roots.', 'S and N are necessary for the synthesis of
    amino acids, proteins, and various other cellular components, including thiol
    compounds and the so-called secondary sulphur compounds, which have a significant
    bearing on protection of plants against stress and pests.', 'GLS content is highly
    correlated with the S content, therefore, there is a strong potential for modifying
    GLS accumulation in crop plants by altering S nutrition.', Several reports indicated
    that S fertilization may affect the GLS level more than N fertilization., 'In
    fact, each GLS molecule contains at least two sulfur atoms.', "One is part of
    the sulfate group originating from 3\u2032-phosphoadenosine 5\u2032-phosphosulfate,
    while the other, originating from cysteine, is part of an S-linked glucose residue.",
  'In addition, many GLSs are synthezised from methionine and so may have a third
    sulfur atom in their structures.', S fertilization leads to increases in GLS content
    in most cases., 'In some cases an over 10-fold increase was observed, as reported
    by Falk et al.', in their review about the effect of S supply on GLS content.,
  Alnsour et al., showed recently that in vitro grown horseradish plantlets contained
    increasing GLS concentrations when the culture media was supplemented with additional
    sulfate., 'They concluded that GLS concentrations in the stalks and leaves of
    Armoracia in vitro plants could be modulated 20-fold by varying the sulfate concentration
    in the medium, while the increase of sulfate concentration had nearly no impact
    on the GLS concentration in the roots.', 'The GLS content of a plant is dependent
    not only on S nutrition, but also on the N level of the plant.', 'Particularly,
    through handling of fertility management, the experimental results of Rosen et
    al.', clearly demonstrate that GLSs in cabbage were maximized at low N and high
    S application rates., 'As the ratio of N to S increases, GLS content declines,
    probably because vegetative growth outpaces GLS biosynthesis, diluting the content
    of these metabolites.', 'To quantify the effects of supply and combination of
    these nutrients on GLS composition, Li et al.', "showed as the total GLS concentration
    in turnip roots was strongly influenced by N and S supply: with low S supply,
    total GLS concentrations were 0.8\u20132.3 times higher at 80 kg N ha\u22121 compared
    to treatments with 160 and 240 kg N ha\u22121; however, at the high S level, increasing
    N supply did not affect total GLS concentration.", 'In broccoli, Omirou et al.',
  "found that the GLS concentration was low in the 50 kg ha\u22121 N treatments in
    all plant organs, but it did not respond to N application above 250 kg ha\u22121,
    while total GLS concentrations, clearly responded to increasing S applications
    within the whole wide range of S applications, indicating that S is main determinant
    of the concentration of total GLSs in the plant organs.", 'All these studies suggest
    that manipulating the N and S supply might be one means of altering GLS level
    in plants, thereby providing an opportunity to enhance organoleptic properties
    and health benefits of horseradish, or its value as biofumigant.', 'To maintain
    proper nutrition, fertilizer is applied based on results from chemical soil analysis,
    soil type, cultivar, and cropping history.', "As reported in the review of Walters
    and Wahle, in A. rusticana a typical fertilizer program includes about 168 kg
    ha\u22121 nitrogen, with phosphorus and potassium rates based on soil type or
    soil test results, with applications generally ranging from 56 to 280 kg ha\u22121.",
  "In addition, about 1\u20132.8 kg ha\u22121 boron and 17\u201328 kg ha\u22121 sulfur
    is made with the initial N\u2013P\u2013K broadcast application.", 'Excessive nitrogen
    rates should be avoided, as this can result in excessive foliar growth and highly
    branched, irregular root formation.', "For the best response to fertilizers, a
    pH range of 6\u20137.5 is ideal.", 'The horseradish plant thrives in deep loam
    or sandy soil types, well-drained; organic matter is often added to maintain a
    good soil structure, while shallow soils or those with hard pans are not suitable
    as they compromise strong root development and thus may curtail yield.', Fields
    are prepared for planting with ridgers to create raised beds that increases yield
    of high-quality roots by ensuring that the soil is loose so that large roots can
    develop., "Planting is done either by hand or using modified transplanters that
    place sets in the beds at a 45-degree angle; the spacing adopted is 40\u201360
    cm between plants and 75\u201390 cm between rows, giving a plant population of
    20,000\u201325,000 plants ha\u22121.", 'Irrigation during drought conditions,
    especially during late summer and fall, is sometimes done to improve marketable
    yields because most root-sizing occurs during this period.', "Usually, horseradish
    is harvested in late October\u2013November once the foliage has been killed by
    frost, continuing through the winter and early spring months.", "Finally, to preserve
    the traditional knowledge related to crop management, it is important to underline
    that in regions like Bavaria or Hajd\xFAs\xE1g, some cultivation practices, even
    today, take place mainly by hand.", 'More studies are required for a better understanding
    particularly of the effects of irrigation, fertilization and time of harvest on
    yield and quality of horseradish to optimize crop management.', 'Over recent years,
    the GLSs, a large group of nitrogen- and sulfur-containing secondary metabolites,
    particularly abundant in plants belonging to the Brassicaceae and related families,
    have attracted the attention of the scientific community for their fungicidal,
    bactericidal, nematicidal, allelopathic and anticancerogenic properties.', 'Among
    the Brassicaceae vegetables, horseradish is particularly interesting because it
    is an exceptional rich source of GLSs which could be employed for agro-industrial
    and pharmaceutical purposes.', 'Considering this interest, more studies are needed
    on qualitative and quantitative characterization of GLSs, especially in relation
    to the variability of the currently available horseradish germplasm, growing conditions
    and crop management, plant phenological phases and harvest dates.', 'In addition,
    it is important to stress that recently the interest in natural substances has
    increased and numerous studies on the biocidal activity of a wide range of secondary
    metabolites have been reported, as for example for the allyl isothiocyanate produced
    from sinigrin with a well-documented antimicrobial activity.', 'As reported by
    Mari et al., in Japan, synthetic allyl isothiocyanate is registered as a food
    additive and preliminary data showed that food preserved with this compound contains
    only very low residue of allyl isothiocyanate.', 'Therefore, natural extracts
    of horseradish could be used as alternative to synthetic molecules.', 'For the
    great heritage about the gastronomic and folk medical uses of horseradish, the
    species should be valorized to prevent extinction of genotypes of high nutritional
    value and specific taste and flavour and farmers should continue to cultivate
    landraces in traditional cultivation areas, maintaining the links with territory
    and its history.', 'In fact, the clonal propagation of A. rusticana endangers
    its genetic diversity, so efforts are required to establish well-documented collections
    and to analyze genetic diversity in all accessions available.', 'In addition,
    legal protection of geographic identity of horseradish landraces could contribute
    to conservation of genetic resources, and at same time, could increase the viability
    of little farms.', "For example, by following a centuries-old tradition, horseradish
    is today grown by farmers in Bavaria and Hajd\xFAs\xE1g regions as an PGI and
    PDO, respectively, to preserve the historical link with the territory.", 'For
    small scale growers, horseradish has potential marketing outlets through fresh
    sales to local restaurants, grocery and specialty food stores, and to specialized
    food processing companies.', They can also make sales at farmers markets and roadside
    stands., 'For large scale production, it is common for condiment processors to
    work on a contract basis with growers.', These markets can be competitive and
    difficult to break into., 'Today, further investigations on the chemical, biological
    and molecular aspects of the GLSs and the composition and partitioning in the
    plant are needed to achieve the goal of efficient biodiversity conservation to
    prevent the genetic erosion of local genotypes of horseradish and the risk to
    lose traits that can be useful in future breeding programs.', The authors are
