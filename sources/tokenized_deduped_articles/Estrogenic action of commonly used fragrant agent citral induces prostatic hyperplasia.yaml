[A rat model for benign prostatic hyperplasia in man was investigated., Citral treatment
    of male Copenhagen rats for 4 months via the transdermal route resulted in a marked
    hyperplasia of glandular epithelium and interglandular stroma in the ventral prostate.,
  Despite the cellular hyperplasia there was not a significant increase in prostate
    weight., 'Investigations of the mechanism of action of citral showed that application
    of citral directly to the vagina in female, ovariectomized rats resulted in an
    increased proliferation of vaginal epithelium and a significant increase in the
    BrdUrd incorporation in vaginal epithelial cells, in short a similar effect to
    that of estrogen application.', 'In an in vitro assay citral proved to inhibit
    estrogen binding to estrogen receptors, while no such inhibition was observed
    with testosterone for androgen receptors.', 'These observations together with
    the estrogen implication in the BPH and the reported incidence of gynecomastia
    following exposure to geraniol, a precursor of citral, strongly suggest that the
    prostatic hyperplasia-inducing capacity of citral may be due to its estrogenic
    action.']
