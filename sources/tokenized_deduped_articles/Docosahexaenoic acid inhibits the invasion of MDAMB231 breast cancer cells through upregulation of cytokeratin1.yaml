["Docosahexaenoic acid, the main member of the omega-3 essential fatty acid family,
    has been shown to reduce the invasion of the triple\u2011negative breast cancer
    cell line MDA\u2011MB\u2011231, but the mechanism involved remains unclear.",
  'In the present study, a proteomic approach was used to define changes in protein
    expression induced by DHA.', "Proteins from crude membrane preparations of MDA\u2011MB\u2011231
    cells treated with 100 \xB5M DHA were separated by two\u2011dimensional electrophoresis
    and differentially expressed proteins were identified using MALDI\u2011TOF mass
    spectrometry.", "The main changes observed were the upregulation of Keratin, type
    \u2161 cytoskeletal 1, catalase and lamin\u2011A/C.", Immunocytochemistry analyses
    confirmed the increase in KRT1 induced by DHA., "Furthermore, in vitro invasion
    assays showed that siRNA against KRT1 was able to reverse the DHA\u2011induced
    inhibition of breast cancer cell invasion.", "In conclusion, KRT1 is involved
    in the anti\u2011invasive activity of DHA in breast cancer cells."]
