text: ['This study describes the occurrence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons  in
    smoked tea and tea infusions, via the monitoring of benzoanthracene, chrysene,
    benzofluoranthene and benzopyrene  that have been chosen as indicators for the
    occurrence of PAHs in food by the European Food Safety Agency.', 'The concentrations
    ranged from 1.2 g/kg for benzofluoranthene to 125.0 g/kg for benzoanthracene in
    smoked tea leaves, and from 0.6 g/L for benzoanthracene to 1.2 g/L for benzofluoranthene
    in smoked tea infusions.', Benzopyrene was never detected in infusions., The concentrations
    in non-smoked tea leaves ranged from 0.6 g/kg for benzoanthracene to 10.8 g/kg
    for benzofluoranthene., It was shown that the concentrations of benzoanthracene
    and chrysene were higher in smoked tea than in non-smoked tea while no difference
    was observed for benzofluoranthene and benzopyrene., 'The concentrations of PAHs
    in tea infusions are low compared to other foodstuffs, but the migration rates
    from leaves into water are high.']
