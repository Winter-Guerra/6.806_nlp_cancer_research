text: [The tropical edible red seaweed  is rich in nutrients and polyphenolic compounds
    that may suppress cancer through its antioxidant and antiproliferative properties.,
  The study reports on rat mammary tumor suppression and tissue antioxidant status
    modulation by E. cottonii ethanol extract., The effect of orally administered
    ECE  was compared with that of tamoxifen., Rat was induced to develop mammary
    tumor with subcutaneous injection of LA-7 cells., 'The ECE was more effective
    than tamoxifen in suppressing tumor growth, improving tissues  malondialdehyde
    concentrations, superoxide dismutase activity and erythrocyte glutathione concentrations.',
  'Unlike tamoxifen, the ECE displayed little toxicity to the liver and kidneys.',
  'The ECE exhibited strong anticancer effect with enzyme modulating properties, suggesting
    its potential as a suppressing agent for mammary gland tumor.']
