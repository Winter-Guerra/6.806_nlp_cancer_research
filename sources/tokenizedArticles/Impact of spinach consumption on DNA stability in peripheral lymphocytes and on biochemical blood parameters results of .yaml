text: [A controlled intervention trial was conducted to assess the impact of spinach
    consumption on DNA stability in lymphocytes and on health-related biochemical
    parameters., The participants  consumed homogenised spinach  over a period of
    16 days., 'DNA migration was monitored in single cell gel electrophoresiscomet
    assays under standard conditions, which reflect single- and double-strand breaks,
    after treatment of nuclei with lesion-specific enzymes  and after treatment of
    intact cells with H2O2 before, during and after intervention.', 'While no reduction
    in DNA damage was observed under standard conditions after different time intervals
    of spinach intake, other endpoints, namely ROS sensitivity and DNA migration attributable
    to the formation of oxidatively damaged DNA bases  were reduced 6 h after consumption
    of the first portion and after 11 days of continuous consumption.', 'In the case
    of ENDO III-sensitive sites, also after 16 days, a decrease in comet formation
    was observed.', 'At the end of a 40 days washout period, the DNA stability parameters
    were not significantly different from the background values.', 'Other biochemical
    parameters which were significantly altered by spinach intake were the folate  and
    homocysteine  concentrations in blood, and it was found in an earlier human study
    that folate may prevent oxidative damage to DNA bases.', 'Taken together, our
    results show that moderate consumption of spinach causes protection against oxidative
    DNA damage in humans and that this phenomenon is paralleled by alterations of
    health-related biochemical parameters.', 'It is assumed that dietary constituents
    which improve the stability of DNA prevent health effects related to genomic instability
    such as cancer, ageing, arteriosclerosis cardiovascular disorders, infertility
    and heritable diseases.', 'Therefore, strong efforts were made during the last
    decades to identify such components in human foods.', 'Spinach is a rich source
    of chemoprotective substances such as folic acid, flavonoids, lutein, zeaxanthine,
    -carotene and chlorophylls, which may contribute to the maintenance of the genetic
    material.', 'The latter compounds are potent antioxidants, and a recent in vitro
    study showed that the 2,2-azinobis- acid  radical scavenging activity and also
    the oxygen radical absorbance capacity  values and metal chelating properties
    of spinach are higher than those of other commonly consumed vegetables such as
    carrots, tomatoes, potatoes, green beans and kale.', 'Results of an older single
    cell gel electrophoresis  study by Pool-Zobel and coworkers  indicated that the
    consumption of the vegetable may protect humans against formation of single- and
    double-strand breaks but not against formation of oxidised purines in lymphocytes,
    while Porrini et al.', found in a more recent small trial substantial reduction
    in DNA migration induced by reactive oxygen species  in the same experimental
    system after a 3-week intervention period., Comparisons with findings of earlier
    investigations indicate that spinach may have a high protective potency as in
    many human intervention trials with other types of plant foods no evidence for
    protective effects was seen., The main aim of the present study was to investigate
    the potential DNA-protective properties of spinach in more detail., 'Therefore,
    we conducted an intervention trial which had, for reasons of comparison, a similar
    design as the aforementioned Italian study.', 'However, we analysed DNA migration
    additionally at different time points and included further endpoints of DNA stability.',
  'Damage was measured under standard SCGE conditions, migration attributable to reactive
    oxygen species  was determined after hydrogen peroxide  treatment of the cells
    and formation of oxidised DNA bases was monitored by use of lesion-specific enzymes.',
  'In addition, also a number of biochemical blood parameters related to the health
    status was measured, namely homocysteine, folate, iron, triglycerides, glucose,
    high- and low-density lipoprotein  and the vitamins A, E and B12.', 'Furthermore,
    also the effects of spinach intake on the numbers of different types of blood
    cells and on the haematocrit and haemoglobin concentrations were monitored.',
  'Low  and normal melting agarose  were obtained from Gibco, anorganic salts, hydrogen
    peroxide, Trizma base, Triton X-100, dimethyl sulfoxide, RPMI 1640, Histopaque-1077,
    bovine serum albumin fraction V, ethidium bromide and trypan blue were purchased
    from SigmaAldrich.', FPG and ENDO III were a gift of M. Dunska., The BIO-RAD protein
    assay came from BIO-RAD., 'The study was approved by the Ethical Commission of
    the Medical University of Vienna, and informed consent was obtained from all participants.',
  'All of them were enrolled at the same time and healthy non-smokers and consumed
    a mixed diet, and none of them consumed pharmaceutical drugs and dietary supplements
    8 weeks before and during the study.', The demographic characteristics of the
    subjects are summarised in Table 1., The participants were asked to record the
    types and amounts of foods they consumed during the intervention and were asked
    at the end of the trial if they differed from their usual dietary habits., 'According
    to the information they provided, the food consumptions patterns and the caloric
    intake were not or only marginally altered.', This latter assumption is also supported
    by the fact that no significant weight changes were seen after the intervention
    and at the end of the washout period as compared with the start of the study.,
  'Five days before and during spinach consumption and also 5 days before the end
    of the washout period, the participants were asked to reduce consumption of antioxidant
    rich fruits, vegetables, beverages and spices, to consume only moderate amounts
    of alcohol and to abstain from exhausting physical exercises, which may have an
    impact on the outcome of the study.', The design of the study is shown schematically
    in Fig., '1.', 'After a run-in phase of 5 days, the participants consumed 225
    g of spinach/day over a total period of 16 days.', 'Blood samples were collected
    at the beginning of the study, 6 h after consumption of the first portion of spinach,
    on day 11, on day 16  after continuous consumption and after a washout period
    of 40 days.', The meals were prepared by the participants from deep frozen unprocessed
    homogenised spinach  and consumed as part of their normal daily diet., 'To each
    portion, 8.0 g of corn oil was added to improve the absorption of carotenoids.',
  'The participants in the control group were asked to consume an identical amount
    of corn oil and add it to their regular diet, as it can be not excluded that the
    additional oil consumption may lead to improved uptake of other fat soluble dietary
    antioxidants other than those contained in spinach.', Blood was collected by venipuncture.,
  'For SCGE assays, 5.0 ml was collected in heparinised tubes.', Peripheral lymphocytes
    were isolated with Histopaque 1077  by centrifugation., The cells were suspended
    in autologous plasma supplemented with DMSO., 'Subsequently, the suspensions were
    deep frozen according to the procedure described by Duthie et al., i.e.', the
    cells were frozen slowly in polystyrene boxes stored overnight at 80 C and finally
    transferred to liquid nitrogen., We used this procedure in earlier trials and
    obtained high viability rates of the cells., 'For the determination of the biochemical
    parameters and for the cell counts, blood was collected in different tubes and
    processed as described in detail by Schaenzler and Bieger.', DNA migration was
    determined under alkaline standard electrophoresis conditions and after treatment
    of the cells with H2O2 according to international guidelines., Exposure of isolated
    nuclei to lesion-specific enzymes was performed as described in detail in the
    article by Collins et al.. All parameters were measured in one participant at
    all time points at the same day., 'In total, 90 slides were prepared per day per
    participant and analysed in different four electrophoresis procedures.', 'Briefly,
    the cells were transferred to agarose-coated slides  and lysed in buffer  for
    1 h. After 20-min unwinding and 20-min electrophoresis, the gels were stained
    with ethidium bromide.', 'In order to measure the sensitivity of the cells towards
    ROS-induced DNA damage, they were exposed to H2O2 ; subsequently, the nuclei were
    isolated, and DNA damage determined under standard conditions.', 'Additionally,
    nuclei were treated after lyses with the lesion-specific enzymes FPG and ENDO
    III or with the respective enzyme buffers.', 'To determine the optimal amounts
    of the enzymes, we conducted experiments with different dilutions of the enzymes
    prior to the main study.', 'After lyses, the slides were washed twice in enzyme
    reaction buffer  for 8 min.', The incubation time was 30 min for FPG and 45 min
    for ENDO III., 'After 40 min unwinding and 30 min electrophoresis, the gels were
    stained with ethidium bromide.', 'For each endpoint, three slides were made in
    parallel and 150 cells were analysed from each sample for comet formation by use
    of an automated image analysis system.', 'To calculate the endogenous formation
    of oxidised pyrimidines and purines, the extent of DNA migration measured with
    the buffers was subtracted from the values obtained with the respective enzymes.',
  'The viability of the cells was assessed in all experiments with the trypan blue
    exclusion technique  since a decline of the viability has been postulated to affect
    the outcome of SCGE measurements ; in the present study, the vitality of the cells
    was in all samples sufficiently high and all of them were analysed.', 'The concentrations
    of the vitamins A, E, B12 and folic acid were measured in serum samples.', 'For
    vitamin C analyses, stabilized Li-heparin plasma was used.', 'For the quantification
    of plasma-homocysteine, blood samples were collected and transported in chilled
    EDTA tubes.', 'After centrifugation, all samples were stored at 20 C until analyses.',
  'In HPLC analyses, the signals from the UV detector were integrated and analysed
    with the Chromeleon software from Dionex.', Vitamin A and vitamin E were measured
    with commercial test kits from Chromsystems., 'Briefly, the method used an isocratic
    HPLC system with an UV detector set at 325 nm for vitamin A analyses and was switched
    during the elution to 295 nm for vitamin E measurements.', 'Interassay coefficients
    of variations were 5%  at 1.8  mol/l vitamin A and 2%  at 20.1  mol/l vitamin
    E, respectively.', 'For vitamin C analyses, the plasma samples were stabilized
    immediately after isolation by addition of a precipitation reagent, which was
    a component of an HPLC-kit from Immundiagnostik.', 'Following isocratic elution,
    vitamin C was measured at 254 nm.', Interassay coefficients of variations were
    12%  at 21  mol/l., 'Vitamin B12, folic acid and homocysteine were measured by
    immunoassays with an Architect System.', The analyser and the kits were from Abbott
    Laboratories., 'Interassay coefficients of variations were 4%  at 351  pmol/l
    vitamin B12, 7%  at 9.6  nmol/l folic acid and 5%  at 13.4  mol/L, respectively.',
  Iron levels were monitored photometrically with the triazin assay., 'Total serum
    cholesterol, HDL and LDL were determined with the Olympus enzyme assay, and triglycerides
    were determined as described by Tietz.', 'Uric acid was monitored with the uricase
    test, and glucose was determined with the hexokinase assay.', C-reactive protein  with
    turbidimetric immunoassays., Photometric measurement was conducted with an Olympus
    AU5400 automated analyser., 'Blood cells were enumerated with an automated haematology
    analyser, as described by Ruzicka et al..', Sample size was determined based on
    the results of a previous study., A reduction in DNA migration by 50% translates
    into an effect size of eta = 0.3., 'To have a power of 95% to detect an effect
    of this size at the 1% level of significance, a sample of 8 subjects evaluated
    at 5 time points is necessary.', Results of the biochemical analyses were tested
    for normality by KolmogorovSmirnov tests., 'Because of deviations from the assumption
    of normality, non-parametric statistical tests were performed.', The medians of
    DNA migration from fifty cells per slide were arcsine transformed to comply with
    the sphericity assumption that was tested by Mauchleys sphericity test., 'Differences
    between time points were tested by within-subject ANOVA, and comparisons with
    the baseline  were performed by application of linear contrasts.', Triplicate
    measurements for each participant and time point were tested for outliers by Grubbs
    test., 'In case one of these measurements was deviating significantly, the respective
    slide was excluded from further analysis.', 'In total, 34 slides out of 840 were
    excluded.', 'For all tests, p values 0.05 were considered significant.', No adjustment
    for multiple endpoints was applied., The results of the SCGE assays are summarised
    in Fig., 2a., It can be seen that consumption of the vegetable caused a decrease
    in DNA migration under standard conditions after 6 h which persisted up to 11
    days., 'However, the reduction in comet formation was not significant in this
    experiment.', 'After treatment of the cells with H2O2 and after treatment of the
    nuclei with the lesion-specific enzymes, a clear increase in DNA migration was
    observed.', Impact of spinach consumption on DNA migration in peripheral lymphocytes.,
  The participants of the study  consumed the vegetable over a period of 16 days.,
  'Blood samples were collected at the beginning, 6 h, 11 days  and 16 days after
    consumption and after a washout period.', 'DNA migration was measured under standard
    electrophoresis conditions, which reflect single- and double-strand breaks  and
    after exposure to H2O2  to monitor ROS sensitivity.', 'To measure the endogenous
    formation of oxidised purines and pyrimidines, the nuclei were incubated with
    the lesion-specific enzymes FPG  and ENDO III.', 'Points indicate mean values
    of %DNA in tail, and whiskers indicate 95% confidence intervals.', 'Stars mark
    statistically significant differences from the baseline, p  0.05


    It can be seen in Fig.', 2b that a significant decline of ROS -induced damage  was
    found after spinach consumption., The results obtained with lesion-specific enzymes
    are shown in Fig., '2c, d. Again, pronounced protective effects were observed
    shortly after the start of the intervention which decreased gradually.', 'In the
    case of ENDO III, the reduction in migration was still significant after 16 days
    of spinach consumption.', 'It is also notable that with all endpoints a similar
    pattern of protection was observed, i.e.', the most pronounced decrease in comet
    formation was seen immediately after the beginning of the study and the effects
    decreased as a function of time., 'The results of the biochemical measurements,
    conducted with samples that were collected at the beginning and at the end of
    the intervention phase  and after the washout period, are summarised in Table
    2.', "Impact of spinach consumption  on different biochemical parameters and on
    the vitamins status   \n\nIt can be seen that the folic acid levels increased
    after spinach consumption by 27.2%; also the concentrations of the vitamins C
    and B12 were higher at the end of intervention but this effect did not reach significance.",
  The majority of the other blood parameters was not altered by spinach intake., 'The
    most remarkable change was the decrease in homocysteine, also the CRP level was
    reduced, but this latter effect was not significant.', 'In addition, we monitored
    a number of other clinical parameters such as the counts of erythrocytes, leucocytes,
    lymphocytes, monocytes and neutrophils as well as hematocrit, haemoglobin and
    clotting; none of them was significantly altered at the end of the consumption
    period.', 'Overall, the results of our study indicate that spinach consumption
    protects humans against oxidative DNA damage and leads to significant alterations
    of a number of health-related biochemical parameters.', The observation of DNA-protective
    effects of the vegetable was not unexpected., Pool-Zobel et al., 'found in a study
    in which the participants consumed spinach  after intake of fruit and vegetable
    juice over 2 weeks, a decrease in strand breaks under standard conditions, but
    no significant reduction in ENDO III-sensitive sites.', 'In contrast, the reduction
    in DNA damage under standard conditions did not reach significance in our study,
    but, as described earlier, we found a pronounced decline of DNA migration attributable
    to formation of oxidised purines and pyrimidines.', One of the reasons for these
    differences may be that the study by Pool-Zobel and coworkers  was not well controlled  and
    that dried plant material was used., It is also interesting that no clear effect
    of spinach consumption was found in this trial after the first week., 'In a study
    by Porrini et al., only two time points were monitored, namely at beginning of
    the trial and at the end.', 'The authors detected a significant  reduction in
    H2O2-induced DNA migration after spinach consumption, and no other endpoints of
    DNA stability were monitored.', 'As described earlier, we observed also a protective
    effect after H2O2 treatment in our study.', The strongest reduction in comet formation  was
    seen shortly  after consumption of the first portion of spinach., 'This effect
    lasted until day 11  while after 16 days of intake, the effect  was not significant.',
  'At the end of the washout period, the extent of DNA migration was higher as that
    seen after spinach consumption.', 'In the case of oxidatively damaged pyrimidines,
    the levels were approximately 30% lower as those found at the start of the trial,
    which may be taken as an indication that the washout was not complete.', 'However,
    since the difference is statistically not significant, no firm conclusions can
    be drawn from this observation.', 'The observation of a pronounced effect shortly
    after consumption of the first meal can be taken as an indication that the antioxidant
    effects caused by the constituents of spinach are at least partly attributable
    to direct scavenging effects and not to indirect mechanisms such as induction
    of antioxidant enzymes, which are seen only after extended time periods.', Our
    observation of antioxidant effects of spinach intake is partly supported by the
    findings by Schirrmacher et al., who found a slight induction of SOD and a modest
    reduction in the malondialdehyde levels in plasma of humans after a 10-day consumption
    trial., Only few intervention trials have been conducted in which the time course
    of DNA-protective effects was studied in SCGE experiments., The results of the
    present study show that the strongest decrease in DNA migration occurred shortly  after
    the start of the consumption., 'Subsequently, comet formation decreased as a function
    of the duration of the intervention time, and no significant effects  were seen
    after 16 days.', 'The results obtained in a previous intervention studies depended
    strongly on the type of foods consumed, and no consistent patterns were found.',
  'For example, the most pronounced reduction in regard to oxidation of pyrimidines
    was seen after 8 h in a trial with vitamin C, while no effect was detected after
    continuous consumption over 4 weeks.', 'With phenolics-enriched fruit juice and
    also with apples, no time dependency of the reduction in the comets was seen,
    while a gradual increase in protection was seen in a trial in which the participants
    consumed polyphenolics derived from olive oil.', The results of the measurements
    of the biochemical parameters show clearly that consumption of spinach causes
    a pronounced increase in the folic acid levels in blood., It is well known that
    spinach is a rich source of dietary folate., 'Our finding is in agreement with
    the results of Hannon-Fletcher et al., who conducted an intervention trial in
    which the participants consumed spinach over a period of 6 weeks.', 'In this context,
    it is notable that several investigations showed that intake of folate is associated
    with an improvement of the antioxidant status.', An inverse association between
    folate levels in serum and prevention of DNA damage has been shown in a number
    of micronucleus studies with lymphocytes., 'In SCGE studies, no effects were seen
    in experiments in which comet formation was monitored under standard conditions,
    but a clear association between folate levels and FPG sensitive sites which are
    indicative for oxidatively damaged purines was seen in breast cancer patients.',
  'In the present study, a significant reduction in the homocysteine concentrations
    was observed in plasma ; this effect may be due to reduction in this compound
    to methionine by folate.', 'It has been reported that high homocysteine levels
    lead to release of ROS as a consequence of oxidation of homocysteine disulfide
    ; however, in vitro experiments demonstrated that homocysteine is not a good ROS
    precursor and does not induce damage of calf thymus.', 'Therefore, it is likely
    that other modes of action of folate or other constituents of spinach account
    on its antioxidant effects.', 'As mentioned earlier, it contains high levels of
    the carotenoid lutein, which is a potent antioxidant in vitro.', The compound
    was tested in a human intervention trial by Zhao et al., '; 12 mg was consumed
    per person per day over a total period of 57 days, and no reduction in comet formation
    was found after treatment of lymphocytes with H2O2, while a significant decrease
    in DNA migration was observed after 43 days of continues uptake.', 'Since cooked
    spinach contains between 6.5 and 7.5 mg of lutein per 100 g, the dose of the carotenoid
    given in the aforementioned trial is contained in the vegetable consumed by the
    participants in the present study.', Spinach contains also relatively high amounts
    of chlorophyll  but it is unlikely that the pigment which is a potent antioxidant
    when tested in vitro  accounts for the effects in the lymphocytes as it is only
    poorly absorbed in the GI tract., 'We also expected an increase in vitamin A in
    serum, since spinach contains substantial amounts of -carotene, but the vitamin
    status of the participants was quite high before the beginning of the trial, and
    it is known that only a minor fraction of -carotene is converted to the vitamin.',
  'Pronounced protection against oxidative DNA damage was seen in earlier studies
    only with certain types of vegetables, for example with Brussels sprouts and water
    cress, but the lack of clear effect in trials in which the participants consumed
    relatively large amounts of a mixed fruit and vegetable diet   or a vegetable/fruit
    concentrate   indicates that only certain plant-derived foods have pronounced
    DNA-protective capacity.', Our findings indicate that spinach is one of them and
    that it alters and shows several disease-related biochemical parameters., 'Taken
    together, the results suggest that its consumption has a beneficial impact on
    the health status of humans.', The authors are thankful to Dipl., Ing., Barbara
