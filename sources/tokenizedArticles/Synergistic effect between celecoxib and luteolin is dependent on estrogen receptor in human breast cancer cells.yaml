text: [The anti-cancer effects of celecoxib and luteolin are well known., 'Although
    our previous study demonstrated that the combination of celecoxib and luteolin
    synergistically inhibits breast tumor growth compared with each of the treatments
    alone, we did not uncover the molecular mechanisms of these effects.', The aims
    of our present study were to compare the effects of a celecoxib and luteolin combination
    treatment in four different human breast cell lines and to determine the mechanisms
    of action in vitro and in vivo., The synergistic effects of a celecoxib and luteolin
    combination treatment yielded significantly greater cell growth inhibition in
    all four breast cancer cell lines compared with the single agents alone., 'In
    particular, combined celecoxib and luteolin treatment significantly decreased
    the growth of MDA-MB-231 cancer cells in vivo compared with either agent alone.',
  The celecoxib and luteolin combination treatment induced synergistic effects via
    Akt inactivation and extracellular signal-regulated kinase  signaling inhibition
    in MCF-7 and MCF7/HER18 cells and via Akt inactivation and ERK signaling activation
    in MDA-MB-231 and SkBr3 cells., 'These results demonstrate the synergistic anti-tumor
    effect of the celecoxib and luteolin combination treatment in different four breast
    cancer cell lines, thus introducing the possibility of this combination as a new
    treatment modality.', The anti-cancer effects of celecoxib and luteolin are well
    known., The inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2  by celecoxib has pro-apoptotic effects
    in breast cancer., Several studies have demonstrated the anti-oncogenic mechanism
    of this COX-2 inhibitor as well as the association between celecoxib treatment
    and significant improvements in the survival of patients with breast cancer.,
  'Luteolin, or 3,4,5,7-tetrahydroxyflavone, is a common flavonoid.', 'The anti-cancer
    properties of luteolin are associated with apoptosis induction, redox regulation,
    DNA damage, protein kinase and cell proliferation inhibition, and metastasis and
    angiogenesis suppression.', 'For anti-cancer treatments, combinatorial strategies
    can provide synergistic tumor growth inhibition and reduced systemic toxicity
    relative to each of the monotherapeutic regimens alone.', 'Based on these data,
    our previous study demonstrated that a combination of celecoxib and luteolin provides
    better breast cancer cell growth inhibition than either treatment alone in two
    human breast cancer cell lines -positive MCF-7 human breast cancer cells and ER-negative
    MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells).', 'However, recent advances in our molecular
    technique-based understanding of breast cancer biology have allowed us to divide
    breast cancers into at least four subtypes, especially ER-positive/human epidermal
    growth factor receptor 2 -negative, ER-positive/HER-2-positive, ER-negative/HER-2-negative,
    and ER-negative/HER-2-positive.', 'Therefore, HER-2 expression is an important
    determinant of proper breast cancer treatment.', The aims of our present study
    were to compare the effects of a celecoxib and luteolin combination treatment
    in four different human breast cancer cell lines that are distinguished according
    to ER and HER-2 expression and to subsequently determine the mechanisms of action
    in vitro and in vivo., 'Antibodies and reagents were purchased from the following
    commercial sources: celecoxib and luteolin were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich,
    and 2--4H-1-benzopyran-4-one ; 2--8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one ; anti-proliferating
    cell nuclear antigen ; anti-extracellular signal-regulated kinase  1/2; phospho-specific
    anti-ERK1/2; phosphorylated Ser473 Akt, Akt, Bcl-2, Bax, Bad, Bak, and PARP; and
    cleaved PARP antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc..


    Four human breast cancer cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture
    Collection : the ER-positive/HER-2-negative MCF-7 cells, the ER-positive/HER-2-positive
    MCF7/HER18 cells, the ER-negative/HER-2-negative MDA-MB-231 cells, and the ER-negative/HER-2-positive
    SkBr3 cells.', 'The cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium  supplemented with
    heat-inactivated 10 % fetal bovine serum, 300 mg/L l-glutamine, 25 mM HEPES, 25
    mM NaHCO3, 100 g/mL of streptomycin, and 100 U/mL penicillin.', The cells were
    grown in a humidified incubator at 37 C with a 5 % CO2 atmosphere., 'The effects
    of celecoxib and luteolin on human breast cancer cell growth were determined using
    an 2,3-bis-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide inner salt  assay.', The XTT assay was
    performed according to the manufacturers instructions., 'One thousand cells were
    seeded in triplicate in six-well plates either with or without celecoxib and/or
    luteolin and were assayed after 72 h. Following the incubation, celecoxib-treated
    cells were fixed in dimethyl sulfoxide, and luteolin-treated cells were fixed
    in isopropyl alcohol.', 'Following fixation, the cells were analyzed using the
    XTT cell proliferation kit.', Absorbance at 570 nm was read on an automated spectrophotometric
    miniplate reader., The values were normalized and plotted as the percent change
    relative to control cells., The data from the XTT assay were analyzed using CalcuSyn
    software., This software package analyzes the combined effects of drugs and automatically
    determines synergism and antagonism., CalcuSyn performs multiple drug dose-effect
    calculations according to the median effect methods described by Chou and Talalay.,
  'In the isobologram graph, a point above the oblique line is considered an antagonistic
    effect, a point below the oblique line is considered a synergistic effect, and
    a point on the line is considered an additive effect.', 'A combination index  ;1.0
    is indicative of synergy, an additive effect yields a CI of 1.0, and antagonism
    results in a CI &gt;1.0.', 'The cells were lysed, and the protein concentrations
    were determined using the Bio-Rad colorimetric assay.', The lysates were analyzed
    via Western blotting after resolution on 10 % sodium dodecyl sulfate gels., The
    gel lanes were each loaded with 50 g of protein and electrophoresed for 2 h at
    90 V. Proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes., 'The membranes
    were blocked with 5 % nonfat dry milk and incubated with antibodies directed against
    PCNA, Bcl-2, Bax, Bad, Bak, Akt, p-Akt, PARP, cleaved PARP, ERK, and phospho-ERK
    overnight at 4 C. The membranes were then washed and incubated with a secondary
    antibody for 1 h at room temperature.', 'The membranes were subsequently developed,
    and protein signals were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence Western
    blotting detection reagent.', 'The membranes were incubated with an antibody against
    actin  to ensure equal protein loading, and the results were subjected to densitometry
    analysis.', Apoptotic human breast cancer cells were identified via annexin V-fluorescein
    isothiocyanate /propidium iodide  staining., Annexin V-FITC and PI staining was
    performed using a detection kit according to the manufacturers protocol., 'A total
    of 1  105 cells/mL were incubated with celecoxib and/or luteolin for 72 h. The
    cells were subsequently washed with cold PBS and suspended in 100 mL of buffer,
    140 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM CaCl2).', 'After the addition of 5 L each of annexin V-FITC
    and PI, the cells were incubated for 15 min at room temperature in the dark.',
  'Following this incubation, 400 mL of binding buffer solution was added, and the
    cells were analyzed via flow cytometry.', Human breast cancer cells were cultured
    with a mitogen-activated and extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase  inhibitor  or
    a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase  inhibitor  for 2 h in the dark., 'Next, celecoxib
    and luteolin were added for the indicated time periods.', The numbers of apoptotic
    cells were measured via annexin V-FITC/PI staining., We used a nude mouse xenograft
    model to assess the anti-cancer efficacy of celecoxib and luteolin as mono-therapies
    or as a combined therapy in vivo., The animal protocol was approved by the Catholic
    University of Korea St. Vincents Hospital Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.,
  'Briefly, female BALB/c nude mice  were purchased from Deahanbiolink  and maintained
    in a specific pathogen-free facility.', MDA-MB-231 cells  were inoculated s.c.
    into the right flanks of the mice., 'After 7 days, 20 tumor-bearing mice were
    randomly divided into four groups for treatment with celecoxib and/or luteolin.',
  The first control group was treated with vehicle., 'The second, third, and fourth
    groups were treated i.p.', 'twice weekly  as follows: celecoxib, luteolin, and
    celecoxib  + luteolin, respectively.', 'The mice were weighed, and the tumors
    were measured with calipers every 3 or 4 days.', 'The tumor volumes were calculated
    according to the following formula:  / 2.', 'On the final day of treatment, the
    mice were sacrificed by CO2 inhalation.', 'The tumors were excised and fixed in
    formalin, and paraffin-embedded blocks were sectioned at a thickness of 7 m. The
    cleaved PARP and PCNA protein levels in the xenografted tumor tissues were evaluated
    via immunohistochemical staining.', Statistical analyses were performed to compare
    the control and treatment groups as well as the different experimental groups.,
  Continuous data are presented as the mean and standard error deviations with median
    values., Comparisons of the means were performed using one-way ANOVA., Differences
    with a value of p &lt; 0.05 were considered significant., 'Four breast cancer
    cell lines were treated with celecoxib and/or luteolin at various concentrations,
    and cancer cell viability was measured using an XTT assay.', Celecoxib treatment
    alone induced gradual dose-dependent growth inhibition in all four breast cancer
    cell lines., 'The 20 % inhibitory concentration  values of celecoxib were 45,
    40, and 60 M in MCF-7, MCF7/HER18, and MDA-MB-231 cells, respectively.', 'In SkBr3
    cells, 60 M celecoxib reduced cell viability to 10 % of the controls after 72
    h. The IC20 values of celecoxib in MDA-MB-231 and SkBr3 cells were higher than
    those in MCF-7 and MCF7/HER18 cells.', Celecoxib and luteolin combination treatment
    synergistically inhibits the survival of human breast cancer cell lines., 'Four
    breast cancer cell lines were incubated with different concentrations of celecoxib,
    luteolin, or a celecoxib and luteolin combination for 72 h. Cell viability was
    determined using XTT assays.', The combination indices  were calculated using
    the CalcuSyn software., "A CI value &lt;1 indicates synergy \n\nLuteolin treatment
    alone induced gradual dose-dependent growth inhibition in three breast cancer
    cell lines.", 'At a concentration of 30 M, luteolin reduced the MCF-7 cell viability
    to 30 % of that in the controls after 72 h. The luteolin IC20 value was 30 M in
    MCF7/HER18 cells and MDA-MB-231 cells.', 'However, luteolin treatment alone did
    not induce evident apoptosis in SkBr3 cells.', As shown in Fig., '1ad, the celecoxib
    and luteolin combination treatment significantly reduced cancer cell viability
    and demonstrated greater efficacy in inducing tumor cell death compared with the
    individual drugs or the controls in all four human breast cancer cell lines after
    72 h of treatment.', The synergistic apoptotic effects of the celecoxib and luteolin
    combined treatment in the four breast cancer cells were determined via an isobologram
    analysis., 'The celecoxib/luteolin concentration ratios were 3:2 in MCF-7 cells  and
    4:3 in MCF7/HER18 cells.', 'Furthermore, the celecoxib/luteolin concentration
    ratio was 2:1 in both MDA-MB-231 and SkBr3 cells.', As shown in Fig., '1eh, the
    CI values of these concentrations were &lt;1, indicating that celecoxib and luteolin
    may be an effective combination for inhibiting cell growth due to their synergistic
    efficacy in all four breast cancer cells.', 'To evaluate the nature of cell apoptosis
    and proliferation in breast cancer cells following celecoxib and luteolin combination
    treatment, PARP cleavage and PCNA expression were investigated via Western blotting.',
  'When celecoxib and luteolin were combined, significant PARP cleavage was observed,
    and PCNA expression levels were reduced after 72 h of treatment.', We can conclude
    that celecoxib and luteolin combination treatment-induced breast cancer cell death
    is mediated by apoptotic and anti-proliferative effects., Determination of the
    nature of the celecoxib and luteolin combination treatment-induced human breast
    cancer cell apoptosis and proliferation., 'After treating human breast cancer
    cells with celecoxib, luteolin, or a combination, the protein expression profiles
    of total PARP, cleaved PARP, and PCNA were analyzed via Western blotting with
    specific antibodies.', The percentages of apoptotic cell death were determined
    via annexin V-FITC and PI staining followed by flow cytometry analysis., 'p &lt;

    To quantitatively determine the point at which the celecoxib and luteolin combination
    increased apoptosis, all four breast cancer cells were treated with celecoxib
    alone, luteolin alone, or a combination of celecoxib and luteolin for 72 h. The
    percentage of apoptotic cell death was measured via annexin V-FITC and PI staining
    followed by flow cytometry analysis.', As shown in Fig., '2be, the increase in
    the proportion of cells undergoing apoptosis was significantly higher following
    celecoxib and luteolin combination treatment in both cell lines compared with
    celecoxib or luteolin alone.', 'To investigate the common mechanistic basis of
    apoptosis in the context of the synergistic effect of celecoxib and luteolin,
    the expression of a panel of pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2-related proteins
    was investigated via Western blotting.', As shown in Fig., '3a, significant increases
    in the expression of the Bax, Bad, and Bak proteins were observed in all four
    breast cancer cell lines subjected to celecoxib and luteolin combination treatment
    relative to cells treated with celecoxib or luteolin treatment alone.', 'However,
    there was no significant difference in the Bcl-2 protein expression levels.',
  'Therefore, an increase in the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins might be responsible
    for the increased apoptosis observed with the combination treatment.', Identification
    of factors involved in the celecoxib and luteolin combination treatment-induced
    human breast cancer cell apoptosis., 'To investigate the common mechanistic basis
    of apoptosis in the context of the synergistic effect of celecoxib and luteolin,
    the expression levels of pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2-related proteins,
    ERK, phospho-ERK, Akt, and phospho-Akt were examined via Western blotting.', 'The
    MAP/ERK kinase  inhibitor PD98059 and PI3K inhibitor LY294002 were used to evaluate
    whether ERK phosphorylation and Akt inactivation, respectively, are required for
    apoptosis.', The percentages of apoptotic cell death were measured via annexin
    V-FITC and PI staining followed by flow cytometry analysis., 'p &lt; 0.05


    The third member of the canonical mitogen-activated protein kinase  family, ERK,
    regulates multiple signal transduction pathways involved in a variety of functions.',
  'ERK activation through different pathways leads to fundamentally different cellular
    responses, including proliferation, differentiation, survival, and memory consolidation.',
  As shown in Fig., '3a, the phospho-ERK1/2 levels in MCF-7 and MCF7/HER18 cells treated
    with a combination of celecoxib and luteolin were reduced compared with those
    in cells treated with celecoxib or luteolin alone, whereas phospho-ERK1/2 levels
    were increased in MDA-MB-231 and SkBr3 cells treated with a combination of celecoxib
    and luteolin.', The specific MAP/ERK kinase  inhibitor PD98059 was used in our
    study to determine whether phospho-ERK1/2 activation was required for apoptosis.,
  As shown in Fig., '3be, following celecoxib and luteolin combination treatment,
    PD98059 significantly accelerated apoptosis in MCF-7 and MCF7/HER18 cells but
    significantly inhibited apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 and SkBr3 cells.', The PI3 kinase/Akt
    pathway plays a regulatory role in the pro-oncogenic pathway., The downregulation
    of PI3 kinase/Akt pathway activity stimulates apoptosis by inhibiting Akt phosphorylation.,
  'To determine whether Akt phosphorylation was inhibited in celecoxib and luteolin
    combination-treated cells, Akt and phospho-Akt levels were analyzed via Western
    blotting.', As shown in Fig., '3a, significant decreases in the phospho-Akt levels
    were observed in all four breast cancer cell lines following treatment with the
    celecoxib and luteolin combination versus treatment with celecoxib or luteolin
    alone.', 'To assess the role of inhibited Akt phosphorylation in the induction
    of apoptosis following treatment with a celecoxib and luteolin combination, the
    cell-permeable PI3K inhibitor LY294002 was used to inhibit the Akt pathway.',
  As shown in Fig., '3be, LY294002 significantly accelerated apoptosis in all four
    breast cancer cell lines following treatment with combined celecoxib and luteolin.',
  'To confirm our in vitro results, we tested the synergistic anti-cancer effect of
    celecoxib and luteolin in a nude mouse xenograft model.', As shown in Fig., '4a,
    at the end of the overall treatment period, treatment with celecoxib alone, but
    not luteolin alone, reduced MDA-MB-231 tumor volumes relative to those in vehicle-treated
    mice.', 'However, the celecoxib and luteolin combination treatment significantly
    reduced MDA-MB-231 tumor volumes relative to those in mice subjected to other
    treatments.', 'As tumor growth is regulated by both reduced apoptosis and increased
    proliferation, we assessed the levels of cleaved PARP and PCNA.', 'The levels
    of cleaved PARP were markedly decreased, and those of PCNA were markedly increased
    in the MDA-MB-231 tumors.', These results indicate that the celecoxib and luteolin
    combination treatment increased tumor apoptosis and decreased tumor proliferation.,
  Inhibitory effect of the celecoxib and luteolin combination treatment in vivo.,
  Female BALB/c nude mice were injected with MDA-MB-231 cells., The animals were administered
    the following treatments twice weekly by i.p., 'injection : vehicle, celecoxib,
    luteolin, or celecoxib  + luteolin.', 'The mice were weighed, and the tumors were
    measured with calipers every 3 or 4 days.', The tumor sizes were compared among
    the treatment groups., The vertical bars on the tumor growth curve chart indicate
    the standard errors., 'The tumors were excised and fixed in formalin, and paraffin-embedded
    blocks were sectioned at a thickness of 7 m. The cleaved PARP  and PCNA  protein
    levels in the xenografted tumor tissues were evaluated via immunohistochemical
    staining.', The overall intensity level  was used to evaluate protein expression
    levels., The error bars represent the standard errors of the scores., 'p &lt;

    The ability of cytotoxic agents to limit tumor growth might be due to their capacity
    to induce cancer cell apoptosis and reduce cancer cell proliferation.', The anti-cancer
    effects of celecoxib and luteolin are well known., 'However, the anti-cancer mechanisms
    of celecoxib and luteolin in each of the four breast cancer subtypes used in this
    study have not yet been well characterized.', 'Although our previous study initially
    demonstrated a synergistic apoptotic effect of a celecoxib and luteolin combination
    treatment in two human breast cancer cell lines, it had several limitations.',
  'Therefore, we investigated the synergistic apoptotic effect of a celecoxib and
    luteolin combination treatment in four breast cancer cell lines and an in vivo
    xenograft tumor model.', 'In the current study, the treatment of four human breast
    cancer cells with a celecoxib and luteolin combination yielded a synergistic effect
    on cell death compared with treatment with either drug alone.', 'Furthermore,
    our results suggest that apoptosis is the main mechanism of cell death in the
    four human breast cancer cell lines following treatment with the combination of
    celecoxib and luteolin.', 'However, the doses of celecoxib and luteolin required
    to achieve the same apoptotic effect were higher for MDA-MB-231 and SkBr3 cells  than
    for MCF-7 and MCF7/HER18 cells.', This result might be explained by luteolins
    anti-estrogenic activity., Luteolin may function as an anti-estrogenic agent by
    competing with estrogens for ER receptor binding., 'Furthermore, luteolin reduces
    ER expression levels by inhibiting ER gene transcription or potentiating ER protein
    degradation.', 'Indeed, luteolin is able to inhibit DNA synthesis and proliferation
    in mammary epithelial cells and breast cancer cell induced by estrogen, both in
    vitro and in vivo.', These reports suggest that luteolins anti-estrogenic activity
    could at least partly contribute to its anti-proliferative effects on ER-positive
    breast cancer cells., The MEK/ERK and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways are critical
    for breast cancer cell signal transduction., 'Akt is a serine/threonine-specific
    protein kinase that phosphorylates effectors within cell survival, proliferation,
    and metabolism-related pathways.', Many studies concur with the general view that
    celecoxib and luteolin increase apoptosis by inactivating the PI3 kinase/Akt pathway.,
  'Celecoxib inhibits prostaglandin E2, which is the major downstream effecter of
    COX-2, and inhibits apoptosis by stimulating the PI3 kinase/Akt pathway.', 'Furthermore,
    celecoxib can bind to and inhibit 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1.',
  'PDK1 is an essential component of cell growth and survival signaling pathways involving
    PI3K  and Akt/PKB, downstream of PDK1.', 'As an anti-cancer agent, luteolin is
    also able to inhibit the IGF-1-induced activation of IGF-1R and Akt and the phosphorylation
    of Akt.', Our results showed that the combination of celecoxib and luteolin leads
    to synergistic breast tumor cell apoptosis and results in a significant reduction
    in phosphorylated Akt compared to treatment with only one drug or the controls.,
  'Importantly, our study provided strong evidence to support the conclusion that
    the enhanced apoptosis observed with combination treatment  and a PI3K inhibitor  is
    associated with a reduction in phosphorylated Akt.', 'Of the three major MAPK
    pathways, the ERK pathway is the most relevant to breast cancer.', 'However, based
    on previous evidences, the ERK pathway activates either an apoptotic signal or
    a survival signal, counteracts pro-apoptotic effects, in different cancer cell
    types treated with different chemotherapeutic agents.', 'In the present study,
    we provided evidence that ERK signaling inhibition is an important step in the
    induction of celecoxib and luteolin combination treatment-induced apoptosis in
    ER-positive breast cancer cells.', 'However, increased ERK activity was observed
    in ER-negative breast cancer cells  during celecoxib and luteolin combination
    treatment-induced apoptosis.', 'Furthermore, our study provided important evidence
    that enhanced apoptosis occurred in combination-treated ER-positive but not ER-negative
    breast cancer cells treated with the MEK1 inhibitor.', These discrepant findings
    may be attributed to significant levels of cross talk between kinases in the PI3K
    and MAPK pathways in different breast cancer cells., The relationship between
    the PI3K and MAPK pathway is complex and not completely understood., 'Furthermore,
    in breast cancer cells, this molecular circuit is further complicated by additional
    cross talk between ERK and PI3K and other pathways, including important ER signaling
    cascades.', 'Therefore, there is a need to characterize the biology of the canonical
    cascades involving the ERK, PI3K, and ER signaling pathways in response to celecoxib
    and luteolin combination treatment in greater detail.', This characterization
    will help identify breast cancer subtypes that will experience the strongest anti-tumor
    effects from celecoxib and luteolin combination treatment., 'In summary, this
    study demonstrated that a celecoxib and luteolin combination treatment yielded
    synergistic effects in four different breast cancer cell lines and suppressed
    triple-negative  breast tumor growth in vivo, findings that warrant further evaluation.',
  'Based on these strong pre-clinical data, a celecoxib and luteolin combination treatment
    might provide clinical benefits for breast cancer.', 'Although this hypothesis
    requires testing in clinical trials, we have shown the synergistic anti-tumor
    effects of a celecoxib and luteolin combination treatment on four different breast
    cancer cell lines, thus introducing the possibility of this combination as a new
    treatment modality.', 'Furthermore, celecoxib and luteolin, when used in combination
    with other anti-cancer drugs, may improve the therapeutic value of the combined
    agents by allowing the use of lower sub-toxic doses to achieve a more effective
    cancer treatment.', 'This study was supported by the Medical Research Center,
    Catholic University of Korea St. Vincents Hospital.']
