text: [Introduction., 'Although doxorubicin -induced cardiac toxicity and pegylated
    liposomal doxorubicin induced hand-foot syndrome  were reported to be correlated
    with reactive oxygen species  generation, there is no effective preventive treatment
    at present.', 'Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate whether antioxidantsresveratrol,
    tetrahydroxystilbene glucoside, curcumin, and the ethanolic extract of Antrodia
    cinnamomea have the ability to reduce Dox-induced ROS and have a synergistic anticancer
    effect with Dox that could prevent those side effects and enhance the efficacy
    of cancer treatment.', Methods., 3T3 normal cells were used as a model to evaluate
    the effects of these antioxidants in reducing ROS accumulation., 'Furthermore,
    the synergistic anticancer effect of antioxidants with Dox on the MCF-7 breast
    cancer model was also evaluated.', Results., 'Pretreatment of cells with RSVL,
    curcumin, and EEAC increased the cell antioxidant ability by improving the activity
    of superoxide dismutase, prevented or limited intracellular damage, and ameliorated
    the harmful effects of ROS.', 'Additionally, RSVL, curcumin, and EEAC had synergistic
    effects with Dox against MCF-7 breast cancer cells.', Conclusion., 'RSVL, curcumin,
    and EEAC have the potential to be clinically applied to prevent cardiac toxicity
    and HFS and enhance the anticancer efficiency of Dox.']
