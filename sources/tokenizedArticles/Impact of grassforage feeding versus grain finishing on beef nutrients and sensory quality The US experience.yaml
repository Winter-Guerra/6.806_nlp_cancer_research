text: [Studies of forage and/or grass feeding of cattle versus grain finishing have
    been conducted in varying regions throughout the world but generalization of these
    results to beef from U.S. cattle may not be appropriate., 'In particular, available
    grass/forage variety and form as well as cattle breed have a significant impact
    on the nutritional profile of beef.', The current review summarizes the nutritional
    characteristics of beef as reported from the limited number of studies comparing
    U.S. grass/forage-fed versus grain-finished cattle and estimates the intake of
    key nutrients that might be expected from consumption of U.S. beef from either
    feeding system., 'In addition, many studies report changes in fatty acids solely
    as a percentage of total fatty acids.', Since grass/forage feeding typically results
    in a leaner product; the current review compares the fatty acid profile of beef
    from grass/forage feeding to that of grain-finished cattle on a mg/100 g of meat
    basis.]
