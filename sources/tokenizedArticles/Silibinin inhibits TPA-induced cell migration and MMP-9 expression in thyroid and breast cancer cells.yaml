text: ['Matrix metalloproteinases  play an important role in cancer metastasis, cell
    migration and invasion.', 'Herein, we investigated the effects of silibinin on
    12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate -induced cell migration and MMP-9 expression
    in thyroid and breast cancer cells.', Our results revealed that the levels of
    MMP-9 mRNA and protein expression were significantly increased by TPA but not
    MMP-2 in TPC-1 and MCF7 cells., 'To verify the regulatory mechanism of TPA-induced
    MMP-9 expression, we treated TPC-1 and MCF7 cells with the MEK1/2 inhibitor, UO126,
    and TPA-induced MMP-9 expression was significantly decreased.', We also found
    that TPA-induced cell migration and MMP-9 expression was significantly decreased
    by silibinin., 'In addition, TPA-induced phosphorylation of MEK and ERK was also
    inhibited by silibinin.', 'Taken together, we suggest that silibinin suppresses
    TPA-induced cell migration and MMP-9 expression through the MEK/ERK-dependent
    pathway in thyroid and breast cancer cells.', 'Silibinin is the main component
    of the silymarin complex and is isolated from the seeds of Silybum marianum, also
    known as milk thistle.', 'Silibinin has a wide range of pharmacologic effects
    including the induction of apoptosis, and the inhibition of cell proliferation,
    cell invasion and angiogenesis.', 'Recently, Kim et al reported that silibinin
    triggers cell cycle arrest through the downregulation of cyclin B1 and cdc2 and
    upregulation of p21 expression in triple-negative breast cancer cells.', 'In addition,
    silibinin was found to effectively delay the development of spontaneous mammary
    tumors and decrease the tumor mass in Her2/neu transgenic mice.', 'Migration of
    cells is a dynamic process that occurs in tissue remodeling, inflammation and
    wound repair and is regulated by a variety of extracellular factors, including
    extracellular matrix  proteins.', Tumor cell migration is associated with the
    early stages of metastasis., Metastasis is considered responsible for more than
    90% of cancer-related deaths., 'During metastasis, cancer cells are involved in
    numerous interactions with various factors such as the ECM, growth factors, cytokines
    and basement membranes.', 'Consequently, cancer cells acquire motility and local
    invasive capability.', 'In addition, cancer cell-mediated tissue remodeling is
    observed to have a strong positive correlation with matrix metalloproteinase  levels.',
  MMPs are major critical molecules that assist tumor cells during metastasis., They
    play an important role in ECM degradation and cancer cell invasion., Overexpression
    of MMPs contributes to tumorigenesis and tumor progression through multiple pathways.,
  'MMP-9 is one of two gelatinases and is able to degrade type IV collagen, which
    is abundant in basement membranes.', 'High serum levels of MMP-9 are associated
    with a higher tumor grade, poor overall survival and secondary metastasis in melanoma
    and breast cancer tissue.', 'In the present study, we investigated the relationship
    between silibinin and cell migration in thyroid and breast cancer cells.', 'Here,
    our results revealed that 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate -induced MMP-9
    expression and cell migration were suppressed by silibinin in both thyroid and
    breast cancer cells.', 'Dulbeccos modified Eagles medium, antibiotics and 10%
    zymogram gel were purchased from Life Technologies.', Fetal bovine serum  was
    purchased from Hyclone., Silibinin was purchased from Sigma., Mouse recombinant
    MMP-9 was purchased from R&amp;D Systems., TPA was purchased from Tocris., The
    secondary peroxidase-conjugated antibodies and ECL Prime reagents were purchased
    from Amersham., 'Papillary thyroid cancer TPC-1 and breast cancer MCF7 cells were
    grown in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37C in DMEM supplemented
    with 10% FBS, 2 mM glutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin and 100 g/ml streptomycin.',
  'Each cell line was maintained in culture medium supplemented without FBS for 24
    h.


    Cells were maintained in culture medium without FBS for 24 h, and then the culture
    medium was replaced with fresh medium without FBS, and the cells were further
    incubated with the indicated concentrations of silibinin for 24 h. In the experiments
    involving silibinin, the cells were pretreated with 50 M silibinin for 60 min
    prior to treatment with 20 nM TPA for 24 h.


    Zymography was performed on 10% polyacrylamide gels that had been cast in the
    presence of gelatin as previously described.', 'Briefly, samples  were resuspended
    in a loading buffer and run on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel containing 0.5 mg/ml gelatin
    without prior denaturation.', 'After electrophoresis, the gels were washed to
    remove SDS and incubated for 30 min at room temperature  in a renaturing buffer.',
  'Next, the gels were incubated for 48 h at 37C in a developing buffer.', 'The gels
    were subsequently stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250, destained in 30%
    methanol, and flooded with 10% acetic acid to detect gelatinase secretion.', 'Total
    RNA was extracted from cells using the TRIzol reagent, according to the manufacturers
    protocol.', Isolated RNA samples were then used for RT-PCR., 'Samples  were reverse-transcribed
    into cDNA in 20-l reaction volumes using a first-strand cDNA synthesis kit for
    RT-PCR, according to the manufacturers instructions.', Gene expression was quantified
    by real-time PCR using the SensiMix SYBR kit  and 100 ng of cDNA per reaction.,
  'The sequences of the primer sets used for this analysis were: human MMP-9, MMP-2,
    and -actin as an internal control.', An annealing temperature of 60C was used
    for all of the primers., PCRs were performed in a standard 384-well plate format
    with an ABI 7900HT real-time PCR detection system., 'For data analysis, the raw
    threshold cycle  value was first normalized to the housekeeping gene for each
    sample to obtain CT.', 'The normalized CT was then calibrated to control cell
    samples to obtain CT.


    Total cell numbers following treatment with silibinin were evaluated by Quick
    Cell Proliferation Assay Kit II  according to the manufacturers protocol.', 'Briefly,
    TPC-1 human papillary thyroid cancer cells  were grown in a 96-well plate in 100
    l/well of culture media in the absence or presence of the indicated concentrations
    of silibinin.', 'After incubating the cells for 24 h, 10 l WST reagent was added
    to each well.', Viable cells were quantified photometrically at 480 nm., 'TPC-1
    thyroid cancer cells were seeded in 6-well plates and were cultured for 24 h.
    A monolayer of cells was scratched with a 200-l pipette tip to create a wound,
    and then this was washed twice in PBS to remove any suspended cells.', The cells
    were pretreated with silibinin  for 60 min prior to treatment with TPA; the monolayer
    of cells was then treated with 20 nM TPA for 24 h in serum-free media., The cells
    migrating from the leading edge were photographed at 0 and 24 h using a CK40 inverted
    microscope., Statistical significance was determined using the Students t-test.,
  The results are presented as the means  SEM., All p-values were two-tailed and significance
    was set at a p-value ;0.05., 'The levels of MMP-9 and MMP-2 mRNA and protein expression
    in the TPC-1 and MCF7 cells were determined following treatment with TPA at the
    indicated concentrations for 24 h. We analyzed the levels of MMP-9 and MMP-2 mRNA  and
    protein  expression using real-time PCR and zymography, respectively.', Our results
    revealed that the levels of MMP-9 protein expression were significantly increased
    in the TPC-1 thyroid  and MCF7 breast  cancer cells., 'However, MMP-2 protein
    expression was not altered following TPA treatment in the TPC-1 cells, although
    MMP-2 expression was not detected in the MCF7 cells following TPA treatment.',
  'In addition, the levels of MMP-9 mRNA were also increased following TPA treatment.',
  'MMP-9 mRNA expression was increased by 28.86.6- and 30.62.5-fold in the TPC-1 thyroid  and
    MCF7  breast cancer cells, respectively, following treatment with 20 nM TPA when
    compared with the control level.', 'To verify the regulatory mechanism of TPA-induced
    MMP-9 expression, we examined the effect of the MEK1/2 inhibitor, UO126, on TPA-induced
    MMP-9 expression.', 'After pretreatment of TPC-1 and MCF7 cells with 10 M UO126
    for 30 min, we treated the cells with 20 nM TPA for 24 h. The levels of TPA-induced
    MMP-9 protein expression were significantly decreased by UO126 in the TPC-1 thyroid  and
    MCF7 breast cancer cells.', 'In addition, TPA-induced MMP-9 mRNA expression was
    also decreased following pretreatment with UO126.', 'MMP-9 mRNA expression was
    increased by 29.42.4- and 41.80.6-fold, respectively, in the TPC-1 thyroid  and
    MCF7  breast cancer cells, following treatment with 20 nM TPA when compared with
    control levels.', 'In contrast, TPA-induced MMP-9 expression was significantly
    decreased by 7.51.9 and 4.51.3-fold in the TPC-1 thyroid  and MCF7  breast cancer
    cells, respectively, following treatment with 10 M UO126 when compared with the
    control levels.', 'Next, we confirmed the effect of UO126 on TPA-induced phosphorylation
    of MEK and ERK in TPC-1 thyroid cancer cells.', 'As expected, the phosphorylation
    of MEK and ERK was increased following TPA treatment.', 'In contrast, TPA-induced
    phosphorylation of MEK and ERK was significantly decreased by UO126.', The chemical
    structure of silibinin is represented in Fig., 3A., Our results revealed that
    the cell viability was significantly  decreased following treatment with 100 M
    silibinin., 'Therefore, we treated cells with 50 M silibinin in the subsequent
    studies.', 'To investigate the effect of silibinin on TPA-induced MMP-9 expression,
    we pretreated cells with 50 M silibinin for 60 min prior to treatment with 20
    nM TPA.', We found that TPA-induced MMP-9 protein expression was significantly
    decreased by silibinin treatment., 'In addition, the levels of expression of MMP-9
    mRNA increased significantly  in the TPC-1 thyroid  and MCF7 breast  cancer cells,
    respectively, following treatment with a concentration of 20 nM TPA when compared
    to control levels.', 'In contrast, TPA-induced MMP-9 mRNA expression was decreased
    to 5.70.6-fold in TPC-1 thyroid cancer cells by 50 M silibinin.', MCF7 breast
    cancer cells also showed similar results  following treatment with 50 M silibinin
    when compared with the control level., 'In the next experiment, we examined the
    effect of silibinin on TPA-induced cell migration in TPC-1 thyroid cancer cells.',
  As shown in Fig., '5A, TPA-induced cell migration was completely blocked by 50 M
    silibinin treatment.', 'Next, we investigated the effect of silibinin on TPA-induced
    phosphorylation of MEK and ERK in TPC-1 thyroid cancer cells.', 'As expected,
    the phosphorylation of MEK and ERK was increased following TPA treatment.', 'In
    contrast, TPA-induced phosphorylation of MEK and ERK was decreased by silibinin.',
  'Therefore, we demonstrated that silibinin suppressed TPA-induced cell migration
    as well as inhibited MMP-9 expression.', 'Phorbol esters, such as TPA, are natural
    molecules that are recognized as potent tumor promoters and can potently trigger
    multiple cellular events such as protein kinase C. TPA was found to significantly
    enhance cell migration abilities of human cancer cells including hepatoma and
    breast cancer cells.', 'In addition, TPA-induced migration and invasion of glioblastoma
    cells were prevented by blocking PKC-dependent pathways.', 'Consistent with these
    reports, we found that TPA increased cell migration in thyroid and breast cancer
    cells.', 'Herein, we investigated the inhibitory effect of silibinin on TPA-induced
    cancer cell migration.', 'MMPs are positively associated with tumor progression
    including tumor differentiation, metastasis and poor prognosis.', 'In addition,
    inhibition of MMPs decreases cell invasion while the activation of MMPs yields
    increased tumor cell invasion.', 'MMP-9 is one of the gelatinases and is expressed
    in a large number of cell types, including epithelial and inflammatory cells.',
  MMP-9 has been associated with the development and extent of metastases in lymph
    nodes., 'Although we did not present the data, TPA-induced cell migration was
    significantly suppressed by a broad-spectrum MMP inhibitor, PD166793, in both
    TPC-1 and MCF7 cells.', 'Therefore, we demonstrated that a broad-spectrum MMP
    inhibitor, PD166793, directly or indirectly affects TPA-induced cell migration
    through the regulation of MMP activity.', 'The region of the MMP-9 promoter contains
    cis-acting regulatory elements for transcription factors, including two AP-1 sites
    and an NF-B site.', The DNA binding activity of a variety of transcription factors
    such as NF-kB and AP-1 is regulated by ERK activity., 'Recently, we reported that
    TPA-induced transcriptional activity of AP-1 is mediated through the Raf/MEK/ERK-dependent
    pathway.', 'In addition, the transcriptional expression of MMP-9 was found to
    be directly regulated by AP-1 DNA binding activity  and was completely suppressed
    by the MEK1/2 inhibitor, UO126.', 'In accordance with these studies, TPA-induced
    MMP-9 expression was significantly decreased by silibinin.', TPA-induced phosphorylation
    of MEK and ERK was also suppressed., 'Conclusively, we found that silibinin suppresses
    the TPA-induced phosphorylation of MEK and ERK in thyroid cancer cells.', 'In
    addition, cell migration and MMP-9 expression were completely inhibited by silibinin.',
  'Therefore, silibinin may be a promising drug for the treatment of thyroid and breast
    cancer.', This study was supported by a Korea Research Foundation Grant funded
    by the Korean government.]
