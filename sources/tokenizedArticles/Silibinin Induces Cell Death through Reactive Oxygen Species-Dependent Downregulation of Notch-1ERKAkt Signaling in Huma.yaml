text: [The present study was undertaken to determine the underlying mechanism of silibinin-induced
    cell death in human breast cancer cell lines MCF7 and MDA-MB-231., 'Silibinin-induced
    cell death was attenuated by antioxidants, N-acetylcysteine  and 6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchromane-2-carboxylic
    acid, suggesting that the effect of silibinin was dependent on generation of reactive
    oxygen species.', Western blot analysis showed that silibinin induced downregulation
    of extracellular signal-regulated kinase  and Akt., 'When cells were transiently
    transfected with constitutively active  mitogen-activated protein kinase, an upstream
    kinase of ERK and caAkt, they showed resistance to silibinin-induced cell death.',
  Silibinin decreased the cleavage of Notch-1 mRNA and protein levels., Notch-1overexpressed
    cells were resistant to the silibinin-induced cell death., Inhibition of Notch-1
    signaling was dependent on ROSgeneration., Overexpression of Notch-1 prevented
    silibinin-induced inhibition of ERK and Akt phosphorylation., Silibinin-induced
    cell death was accompanied by increased cleavage of caspase-3 and was prevented
    by caspase-3 inhibitor in MDA-MB-231 cells but not in MCF7 cells., 'Silibinin
    induced translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor, which was blocked by NAC,
    and transfection of caMEK and caAkt.', Silibinin-induced cell death was prevented
    by silencing of AIF expression using small interfering AIF RNA in MCF7 cells but
    not in MDA-MB-231 cells., 'In conclusion, silibinin induces cell death through
    an AIF-dependent mechanism in MCF7 cells and a caspase-3dependent mechanism in
    MDA-MB-231 cells, and ROS generation and Notch-1 signaling act upstream of the
    ERK and Akt pathway.', These data suggest that silibinin may serve as a potential
    agent for induction of apoptosis in human breast cancer cells.]
