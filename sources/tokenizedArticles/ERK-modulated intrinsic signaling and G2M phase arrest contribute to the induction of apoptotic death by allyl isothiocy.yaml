text: ['Allyl isothiocyanate, a member of the isothiocyanate  family found in a constituent
    of cruciferous vegetables, possesses anticancer activity and induces apoptosis
    in various types of human cancer cell lines.', 'However, no available information
    showed antitumor effects in human breast adenocarcinoma cells.', The current study
    was focused on exploring the mechanisms underlying AITC-induced apoptosis in MDA-MB-468
    human breast cancer cells in vitro., 'We found that AITC reduced the cell number
    and viability using trypan blue staining with the Countess Automated Cell Counter
    and the MTT assay, respectively.', AITC also was found to induce apoptotic cell
    morphological changes by a contrast-phase microscope and cell cycle arrest at
    G2/M phase by flow cytometric assay in MDA-MB-468 cells., 'Intrinsic apoptosis-associated
    factors such as caspase-9 and caspase-3 activities were performed, and reactive
    oxygen species  production, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential  occurred
    in AITC-treated MDA-MB-468 cells.', 'AITC also stimulated mitochondria-related
    signaling, including p-Bcl-2, cytochrome c and Apaf-1 in MDA-MB-468 cells.', We
    found that the p-ERK signal was upregulated in AITC-treated cells., 'Importantly,
    NAC  and U0126  abolished AITC-reduced viability in MDA-MB-468 cells.', AITC downregulated
    CDK1 activity and altered the expression of G2/M phase-modulated associated protein
    levels by western blotting in MDA-MB-468 cells., 'In summary, our findings demonstrated
    that AITC-promoted G2/M phase and AITC-triggered apoptosis correlate with the
    activation of phosphorylation of ERK in MDA-MB-468 cells.', AITC is a potential
    agent for applcation in the treatment of human breast cancer., 'Allyl isothiocyanate  is
    a compound of the natural isothiocyanates found in cruciferous vegetables such
    as brussels sprouts, cauliflower, cabbage, kale, horseradish and wasabi.', 'AITC
    is known to have multiple effects such as antipathogenic bacteria, anti-inflammatory,
    anti-fungicidal  and anticancer activities.', 'Previous studies have demonstrated
    that AITC exhibits significant antitumor activities against human prostate, colorectal,
    bladder, cervical cancer cells  and leukemia cells.', The anticancer activities
    by AITC are involved in the induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis as well
    as inhibition of cell metastasis., Our previous study demonstrated that AITC triggers
    G2/M phase arrest and apoptosis in human brain malignant glioma GBM 8401 cells.,
  'However, there is no report addressing whether or not AITC inhibits cell proliferation,
    promotes cell cycle arrest and induces apoptosis in human breast adenocarcinoma
    cells.', Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of death in women worldwide.,
  'According to statistical results from GLOBOCAN in 2008 year, about 1.38 million
    new patients were diagnosed in breast cancer, and 458,400 people died from breast
    cancer in the worldwide.', 'In Taiwan, 14.8 per 100,000 women die from breast
    cancer each year according to the Department of Health in 2010.', 'Breast cancer
    cells that lack of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and human EGF receptor
    2  expressions are known as triple negative breast cancer.', 'TNBC is the most
    clinically invasive breast cancer and the characteristics are more invasive, less
    responsive to chemotherapy agents and associated with poorer prognosis.', The
    current therapy for TNBC includes surgery and systemic chemotherapy but the clinical
    treatment is still unsatisfactory., Discovering TNBC therapeutic agents from dietary
    natural products provides a useful application and chemo-preventive or chemotherapeutic
    effectiveness on TNBC., The goal of this study was to explore whether the anti-TNBC
    activity of AITC mediates through the direct cytotoxic effects and to understand
    the molecular mechanisms in human breast adenocarcinoma MDA-MB-468 cells., This
    study is focused on the cell cycle arrest and apoptotic cell death-induced by
    AITC in the MDA-MB-468 cells., 'Our data demonstrated that AITC inhibits cells
    viability, induces apoptotic death, and simultaneously causes cell cycle arrest
    in G2/M phase through the extracellular signal-regulated kinase  signaling pathway
    in MDA-MB-468 cells.', 'AITC, propidium iodide, dimethyl sulfoxide, RNase A, N-acetyl-L-cysteine,
    U0126 and Triton X-100 were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Corp..', 'The fluorescent
    probes 2,7-dichlorofluorescin diacetate  and 3,3-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide
    DiOC6, Dulbeccos modified Eagles medium, L-glutamine, fetal bovine serum, penicillin-streptomycin
    and trypsin-EDTA were obtained from Life Technologies.', 'Anti-p-ERK, anti-ERK,
    anti-Bcl-2, anti-p-Bcl-2, anti-cytochrome c, anti-Apaf-1, anti-cyclin B and anti-CDK1
    and second antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.. Anti-p21/WAF-1  and
    Immobilon Western Chemiluminescent HRP substrate  were bought from Merck Millipore
    Corp..


    Human breast adenocarcinoma MDA-MB-468 cell line was made by Dr Wei-Chien Huang.',
  'Cells were placed into 75-cm2 tissue culture flasks under a humidified 5% CO2 and
    95% air grown at 37C and one atmosphere in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM
    L-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 g/ml streptomycin.', Subconfluent cells  were
    passaged with a solution containing 0.25% trypsin and 0.02% EDTA., 'Cells at a
    density of 2105 were seeded in 12-well plates and then exposed to 5, 10, and 20
    M AITC or 0.1% DMSO  for 24 and 48 h, then the cells were harvested and the cell
    number determined using trypan blue stain by Countess Automated Cell Counter.',
  'Cells were incubated with or without 5, 10 and 20 M of AITC for 24 and 48 h in
    presence and absence of NAC  or U0126.', Cells were determined for viability utilizing
    thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide  assay as previously described., Each data
    point was represented from three independent experiments., Approximately 2105
    cells/well of MDA-MB-468 cells in 12-well plates were incubated with or without
    20 M AITC and equal amount of DMSO as a control for 24 h at 37C., 'At the end
    of treatment, cells were examined and photographed under a phase-contrast microscope
    at a 200 magnification for examining the cell morphological changes.', 'Approximately
    2105 cells/well of MDA-MB-468 cells in 12-well plates were incubated in presence
    and absence of 5, 10 and 20 M AITC then were placed in an incubator for 24 h,
    and then cells were harvested by centrifugation at 1,000  g for 5 min, pellet
    were washed twice with cold PBS then fixed gently by 70% ethanol at 4C overnight.',
  Then cells were washed twice with cold PBS then resuspended in PBS containing 40
    g/ml PI and 0.1 mg/ml RNase A and 0.1% Triton X-100 in the dark for 30 min at
    37C then the cells were analyzed with a flow cytometer  equipped with an argonion
    laser at 488 nm wavelength., Then the cell cycle and sub-G1  group were determined
    and analyzed., 'About 5106 cells of MDA-MB-468 cells in 75-T flasks were treated
    with or without 5, 10, 15 and 20 M of AITC, then incubated for 12 h to detect
    the activity of caspase-9 and -3 which was assessed according to manufacturers
    instruction of the Caspase colorimetric kit.', 'Cells were harvested and lysed
    in 50 l lysis buffer containing 2 mM DTT, for 10 min.', 'After centrifugation,
    the supernatant containing 200 g protein were incubated with caspase-9 and -3
    substrates in reaction buffer.', Then all samples were incubated in a 96-well
    flat bottom microplate at 37C for 1 h. Levels of released pNA were measured with
    ELISA reader  at 405 nm wavelength., 'MDA-MB-468 cells  in 12-well plates with
    0, 5, 10, 15 and 20 M of AITC were incubated for 12 h to determine the changes
    of ROS production and m levels.', 'The cells were harvested by centrifugation
    and were washed twice by PBS, then were resuspended in 500 l of H2DCF-DA  and
    500 l of DiOC6  and incubated at 37C in the dark for 30 min and were analyzed
    immediately by flow cytometry as described previously.', 'MDA-MB-468 cells at
    a density of 5106 cells/ml seeded into T-75 flasks were treated with 5, 10 and
    20 M of AITC for 2 and 12 h. Cells were harvested from each treatment then were
    washed with cold PBS and then scraped and washed twice by centrifugation at 1,000  g
    for 5 min at 4C.', All pellets were individually resuspended in the PRO-PREP protein
    extraction solution  for 3 h at 20C as described previously., 'The lysate from
    each sample was collected by centrifugation at 12,000  g for 30 min at 4C, and
    the supernatant was stored at 20C.', Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide electrophoresis  gels
    were used to separate proteins before each sample was incubated with the primary
    antibodies  followed by secondary antibodies., These blots were then detected
    by Immobilon Western Chemiluminescent HRP substrate  and autoradiography using
    X-ray film., Each Immobilon-P transfer membrane  was stripped and reprobed with
    anti--actin antibody as the loading control for ensuring that equal proteins were
    loaded., 'MDA-MB-468 cells were seeded onto 75-T flask and then treated with 0,
    5, 10 and 20 M of AITC for 12 h. MDA-MB-468 cells were suspended in a final volume
    of 0.2 ml buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 0.2% NP-40, 1 mM DTT,
    1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 0.2 mM PMSF, 1 g/ml pepstatin, 0.5 g/ml leupeptin, 5 mM
    -glycerophosphate, 5 mM NaF, 1 mM Na3VO4 and 5 mM -mercaptoethanol.', 'Cell suspensions
    were sonicated and centrifuged at 10,000  g for 30 min.', CDK1 kinase activity
    condition was determined by using MV Peptide  and measuring OD492 as described
    previously., Our data were performed as means  SD of at least in triplicate.,
  'The difference between the AITC-treated and control groups were analyzed by Students
    t-test, p;0.05 was considered significant.', 'In order to examine the biological
    effects of AITC, MDA-MB-468 cells were treated with varying concentrations of
    AITC at 0, 5, 10 and 20 M for 24 and 48 h. Cells were harvested and the cell number
    was determined using trypan blue stain by Countess Automated Cell Counter, and
    the other cell viability and cell morphological changes were assayed by MTT and
    phase-contrast microscope.', Fig., 1A shows that AITC time-and concentration-dependently
    decreased the number of MDA-MB-468 cells., 'Also, the results of these experiments
    indicated that AITC caused a decrease of cell viability  in a dose- and time-dependent
    manner as well as morphological changes.', 'Based on these pilot observations,
    the treated concentrations were assessed for the effect of AITC at 5, 10 and 20
    M, which caused strong induction of viable cells  and cell morphological changes  mostly
    in a dose- and time-dependent manner in 24 and 48 h. The half maximal inhibitory
    concentration  of AITC was 10.261.31 M after 24-h treatment.', 'According to these
    results, the different concentration and cell death effects of AITC are accompanied
    by its effect on cell cycle progression and/or apoptotic cell death.', We found
    that AITC promoted G2/M phase arrest and sub-G1 population in MDA-MB-468 cells.,
  'Also, these effects were dose- and time-course dependent.', Cells were exposed
    to various concentrations of AITC for 12 h treatment to determine caspase-9 and
    -3 activities., Our results indicated that the caspase-9 and -3 activities were
    time-and concentration-dependently stimulated in AITC-treated MDA-MB-468 cells.,
  'Thus, we suggest that AITC-triggered apoptosis is carried out through caspase-9
    and -3-dependent signaling in MDA-MB-468 cells.', The results of flow cytometric
    analysis for ROS production and m levels are shown in Fig., 4A and B. AITC-treated
    MDA-MB-468 cells with DCF were observed with increased intracellular ROS., We
    further explored if mitochondrial depolarization contributed to AITC-induced apoptosis
    of MDA-MB-468 cells., 'The treated and un-treated cells were exposed to AITC to
    investigate the change in m in MDA-MB-468 after being stained with DiOC6, a mitochondria-specific
    and voltage-dependent dye.', Results shown in Fig., 4B display that AITC significantly
    decreased the levels of m in MDA-MB-468 cells., 'Based on these observations,
    we found that AITC-provoked cell apoptosis is involved in ROS production and intrinsic
    signaling pathway in MDA-MB-468 cells.', 'It is widely reported that ERK/MAPK
    positively regulated phosphorylation of Bcl-2 at Ser-70, causing antiapoptotic
    function to suppress Bcl-2 expression.', 'To clarify whether AITC influences intrinsic
    apoptotic signaling through ERK pathway, the results from western blotting are
    shown in Fig.', '5A and B indicating that the protein levels of p-ERK and ERK,
    p-Bcl-2, cytochrome c and Apaf-1  and p21/WAF-1  were upregulated in MDA-MB-468
    cells after treatment with AITC, but that of Bcl-2 was downregulated.', Many reports
    have shown that apoptosis is associated with the loss of m which is an endpoint
    of apop- which is an endpoint of apoptosis., Our findings indicated that antiapoptosis
    signaling involving Bcl-2 phosphorylation is involved in ERK/MAPK pathway in AITC-treated
    MDA-MB-468 cells., 'To elucidate the possible signaling pathways of AITC-reduced
    viability of MDA-MB-468 cells, we determined whether ROS and ERK mediated AITC-regulated
    apoptotic signaling.', Cells were pretreated with or without NAC  and U0126  and
    then exposed to AITC  for 24 h. Cells were then determined for measuring cell
    viability by MTT assay., As shown in Fig., '6A, cells after treatment with AITC
    in presence and absence of NAC were observed to protect reduction of viability
    of MDA-MB-468 cells when compare with only AITC treated sample.', Fig., 6B displays
    that reduction of cell viability in MDA-MB-468 cells by AITC was dramatically
    reversed by U0126 in comparison to AITC-treated only cells., 'Thus, ROS and ERK
    play central roles in AITC-induced apoptosis of MDA-MB-468 cells.', 'We further
    assessed if G2/M phase arrest is involved in CDK1 activity, and data showed that
    AITC at 520 M dramatically reduced CDK1 activity in MDA-MB-468 cells.', We also
    explored the possible molecular mechanisms in the modulation of G2/M phase arrest.,
  Fig., 7B indicates that AITC caused an increase of p21/WAF-1 expression and a decrease
    of cyclin B and CDK1 protein levels in MDA-MB-468., 'Hence, we suggest that AITC-provoked
    G2/M phase arrest is mediated through activating p21/WAF-1 and suppressing CDK1/cyclin
    B expression in in vitro cultivation of MDA-MB-468 cells.', Many studies in new
    drug discovery have focused on breast adenocarcinoma therapeutic agents through
    the promotion of cell cycle arrest and induction of apoptotic cell death., 'Previous
    studies also demonstrated that AITC arrested HL60 leukemia cells at G0/G1 phase,
    but caused G2/M arrest in UMUC-3 cells, HeLa cells, HT29 cells, SW620 cells, GBM
    8401 cells, PC-3 and LNCaP cells.', 'In this study, our results showed that AITC
    inhibited the cell growth and proliferation on MCF-7 cells, MDA-MB-231 cells,
    and MDA-MB-468 cells  in a time- and concentration-dependent manner.', 'The IC50
    for 24-h treatment of AITC in MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells were 17.962.58,
    11.261.29 and 10.261.31 M, respectively.', One of the reasons for the differences
    in sensitivity in IC50 of different cell lines may be due to the inherently different
    doubling time in different cell lines., 'The doubling time of MCF-7, MDA-MB-231
    and MDA-MB-468 cells were 30.20.7, 28.11.2 and 29.90.5 h. The distinct ability
    of AITC in growth inhibition of MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells might be
    caused by differential gene expression in different cell types.', 'The MCF-7 cell
    line is p53 wild-type, but both of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells are p53 mutant-type.',
  'Many reports have shown that AITC-induced G2/M arrest was associated with a marked
    decrease in the protein levels of cyclin B1, CDK1, cdc25B and cdc25C and caused
    the disruption of tubulin.', The G2/M phase progression is regulated with CDK1
    kinases that are activated in association with cyclin A or cyclin B., The p21/WAF1
    is one of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors  which inhibits cyclin/CDK complexes
    in the G2/M phase., The p21/WAF1 has been found to be associated with the growth
    arrest in cells., Enhanced p21/WAF1 mRNA expression occurs through both p53-dependent
    and -independent mechanisms., 'Furthermore, ERK MAPK pathway has recently been
    reported to cooperate to cause sustained cell cycle arrest requiring p21/WAF1
    expression.', Our results from cell cycle analysis indicated that AITC induced
    G2/M phase arrest  in MDA-MB-468 cells., 'The CDK1 and cyclin B proteins were
    decreased, and phospho-ERK  and p21/WAF-1  were increased by AITC treatment in
    a concentration-dependent manner.', AITC also inhibited the CDK1 activity., Our
    study revealed that the novel molecular mechanism by which AITC induces G2/M phase
    arrest and apoptosis in triple negative breast cancer MDA-MB-468 cells is through
    ERK-dependent p21/WAF-1 upregulation., Two major signaling pathways are involved
    in apoptotic cell death., The extrinsic pathway  through the activation of the
    cell surface  then promotes caspase-8 activation., 'The intrinsic pathway  through
    death signals to mitochondria result in the release of mitochondrial inter-membrane
    proteins such as cytochrome c, which associate with apoptotic protease-activating
    factor-1  and pro-caspase-9 to form the apoptosome and then active caspase-3.',
  The caspase-independent pathway is involved in the mitochondria which led to releases
    of apoptosis inducing factor  or endonuclease G  from mitochondria causing cell
    death., Our results showed that AITC induced apoptotic death  of MDA-MB-468 cells
    and this action is concentration-dependent., AITC treatment in MDA-MB-468 cells
    concentration-dependently promoted the activations of caspase-9 and caspase-3.,
  'Cells were pretreated with NAC  and U0126  and exposed to AITC, leading to increase
    the percentage of viable cells when compared to the AITC-treated only cells.',
  The results in Fig., '5 show that the protein expressions of p-ERK, p-Bcl-2, cytochrome
    c and Apaf-1 were upregulated in MDA-MB-468 cells after treatment with AITC.',
  Our results suggested that AITC upregulated ERK signaling and altered mitochondria-dependent
    associated apoptotic pathway in MDA-MB-468 cells., Bcl-2 phosphorylation is known
    to affect antiapoptotic activity., 'Induction of apoptosis associated with Bcl-2
    phosphorylation by anticancer agents has been linked with altering a variety of
    cellular signaling pathways, such as Ras/Raf, protein kinase C, protein kinase
    A, mitogen-activated protein kinase, ERK and CDK1.', Our results are in agreement
    with previous studies  indicating that that AITC-induced apoptotic cell death
    was caused by Bcl-2 phosphorylation and ERK activation., The molecular signaling
    pathways are summarized in Fig., '8.', Our results demonstrate that the ERK signaling
    pathway modulated intrinsic signaling and G2/M phase arrest in AITC-treated MDA-MB-468
    cells., These findings implied that AITC may be used as a novel therapeutic agent
    for the treatment of human breast cancer., 'This study was supported by the grant
    CMU-100-ASIA-4 from China Medical University and partly supported by the Grant-in-Aid
    from the National Science Council, Taiwan, R.O.C..']
