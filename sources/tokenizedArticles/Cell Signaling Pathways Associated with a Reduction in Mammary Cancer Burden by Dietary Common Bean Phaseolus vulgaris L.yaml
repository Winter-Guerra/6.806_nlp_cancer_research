text: [Emerging evidence indicates that common bean  is associated with reduced cancer
    risk in human populations and rodent carcinogenesis models., This study sought
    to identify cancer-associated molecular targets that mediate the effects of bean
    on cancer burden in a chemically-induced rat model for breast cancer., Initial
    experiments were conducted using a high dietary concentration of bean  where carcinoma
    burden in bean-fed rats was reduced 62.2%  and histological and western blot analyses
    revealed that the dominant cellular process associated with reduced burden was
    induction of apoptosis., 'Further analysis of mammary carcinomas revealed changes
    in the phosphorylation states of mammalian target of rapamycin  substrates, and
    mTOR regulators AMP-activated protein kinase  and protein kinase B.', Effects
    on mTOR signaling in carcinomas were also found at lower dietary concentrations
    of bean., LC-TOF-MS analysis of plasma provided evidence of altered lipid metabolism
    consistent with reduced mTOR network activity in the liver., 'Plasma concentrations
    of insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 were reduced by 36.3 and 38.9%, respectively,,
    identifying a link to Akt regulation.', 'Plasma C-reactive protein, a prognostic
    marker for long term survival in breast cancer patients, was reduced by 23%  in
    bean-fed rats.', Identification of a role for the mTOR signaling network in the
    reduction of cancer burden by dietary bean is highly relevant given that this
    pathway is deregulated in the majority of human breast cancers.]
