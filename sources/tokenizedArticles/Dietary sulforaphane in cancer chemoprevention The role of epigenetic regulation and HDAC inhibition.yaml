text: ['Significance: Sulforaphane, produced by the hydrolytic conversion of glucoraphanin
    after ingestion of cruciferous vegetables, particularly broccoli and broccoli
    sprouts, has been extensively studied due to its apparent health-promoting properties
    in disease and limited toxicity in normal tissue.', 'Recent Studies: Recent identification
    of a sub-population of tumor cells with stem cell-like self-renewal capacity that
    may be responsible for relapse, metastasis, and resistance, as a potential target
    of the dietary compound, may be an important aspect of sulforaphane chemoprevention.',
  'Evidence also suggests that sulforaphane may target the epigenetic alterations
    observed in specific cancers, reversing aberrant changes in gene transcription
    through mechanisms of histone deacetylase inhibition, global demethylation, and
    microRNA modulation.', 'Critical Issues: In this review, we discuss the biochemical
    and biological properties of sulforaphane with a particular emphasis on the anticancer
    properties of the dietary compound.', Sulforaphane possesses the capacity to intervene
    in multistage carcinogenesis through the modulation and/or regulation of important
    cellular mechanisms., 'The inhibition of phase I enzymes that are responsible
    for the activation of pro-carcinogens, and the induction of phase II enzymes that
    are critical in mutagen elimination are well-characterized chemopreventive properties.',
  'Furthermore, sulforaphane mediates a number of anticancer pathways, including the
    activation of apoptosis, induction of cell cycle arrest, and inhibition of NFB.',
  'Future Directions: Further characterization of the chemopreventive properties of
    sulforaphane and its capacity to be selectively toxic to malignant cells are warranted
    to potentially establish the clinical utility of the dietary compound as an anti-cancer
    compound alone, and in combination with clinically relevant therapeutic and management

    The promotion of health by a diet that is rich in Brassica vegetables, including
    its association with a decreased risk of cardiovascular disease  and a lower incidence
    in a wide variety of cancer types, including breast, lung, prostate, and colorectal
    cancer, has been extensively reported in the literature.', A diet of three to
    five servings per week is sufficient to decrease the risk of cancer development
    by 30%40%., 'Table 1 provides a detailed summary of the epidemiological and case-control
    studies published to date, involving the consumption of cruciferous vegetables
    and cancer risk.', 'A number of these studies have reported an inverse association
    with an increase in cruciferous vegetable consumption observed to significantly
    decrease cancer risk, including malignancies of the breast, lung, prostate, pancreas,
    and colon.', 'Systematic reviews of the literature have also confirmed the association,
    with cruciferous vegetable intake weakly correlated with a decreased risk of cancer
    development.', 'Of note, Bosetti et al.', conducted an integrated series of case-control
    studies on various malignancies in order to assess cancer incidence and cruciferous
    vegetable consumption., 'It was found that subjects who consumed at least one
    portion of cruciferous vegetables per week as compared with those with no or occasional
    consumption were associated with a significantly reduced risk of oral cavity and
    pharynx, esophageal, colorectal, breast, and kidney cancer.', 'In addition, Brassica
    vegetables have been associated with the induction of protective mechanisms against
    pollution-related upper airway inflammation, as well as a reduction in markers
    of oxidative stress and hypertension in heart and kidney tissues.', 'The elucidation

    Glucosinolates are a class of secondary compounds present in angiosperms of the
    order Brassicales, which comprises 18 families, 398 genera, and 4450 species.',
  'Figure 1 summarizes the phylogeny of angiosperms, with the Brassicales belonging
    to the malvids group of the monophyletic clade rosids, in accordance to the Angiosperm
    Phylogeny Group  III system.', The APG III system of flowering plant classification
    is the third version of a molecular-based plant taxonomy system published in 2009
    by the APG., 'Overall, Brassicales contain 2.2% of the eudicot diversity, with
    their earliest fossil known from the Turonian.', 'The most important, and perhaps
    most extensively studied glucosinolate-producing family is the Brassicaceae, which
    comprises 49 tribes, including the tribes Brassiceae and Arabideae.', 'Plants
    belonging to the Brassicaceae family exhibit species-specific profiles of glucosinolates,
    a class of compounds thought to function as a part of a defence mechanism against
    pathogens and insects.', Difficulty in establishing evolutionary trends and utilizing
    morphology in phylogenetic studies has been a challenge due to homoplasy in the
    family., The first comprehensive phylogenetic study by Beilstein et al., used
    a sample of 101 genera within the family to assess the chloroplast gene ndhF for
    an intergeneric relationship., This study placed the genera into clades  grouped
    into three main lineages., 'Currently, lineage I include 15 tribes, lineage II
    has been expanded to include 25 tribes, and lineage III now comprises seven tribes.',
  'Substantial support for this system has been provided using an internal transcribed
    spacer of nuclear ribosomal DNA -based phylogeny, nuclear alcohol dehydrogenase,
    chalcone synthase, and plastidic maturase sequence data.The tribes Brassiceae
    and Arabideae are a part of lineage II, with floral monosymmetry evolved independently
    several times within this lineage.', FIG., '1.', The phylogeny of angiosperms  in
    accordance to the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group  III system., 'The order Brassicales
    includes all glucosinolate-producing plants, including those in the Brassiceae  and
    Arabideae tribes.', Advances in the understanding of glucosinolate biosynthesis
    through studies in Arabidopsis thaliana and Brassica sp., 'have suggested that
    aliphatic glucosinolates  are derived from methionine, tryptophan, and phenylalanine.',
  A comparison between Brassica oleracea L. var., 'italic, possessing a Brassica C.genome,
    and Arabidopsis genomes showed sequence similarity and gene order and content
    colinearity in specific chromosomal segments.', 'The synthesis of glucosinolates
    is determined by a simple genetic system containing two distinct sets of genes,
    one determining sidechain elongation and the second involved in the chemical modification
    of the sidechains.', FIG., '2.', Genetic model of the glucosinolate biosynthetic
    pathway in Brassicales., A simple genetic system for the production of glucosinolates
    from methionine., The initial step involves the conversion of methionine to an
    aldoxime through the activity of gene products of the CYP79 gene family., 'The
    aldoxime undergoes conjugation with cysteine, which acts as a sulfur donor, and
    is then cleaved by a C-S lyase.', 'Glucosinolate products are subsequently formed
    through detoxification of potentially toxic thiohydroximates by glucosyltransferase-driven
    glucosylation, and sulfation by sulphotransferase.', 'Side chain modifications
    occur with a high frequency, and profiles become particularly complex after elongation
    of amino acids that are dependent on genetic variation.', Genetic model of methionine-derived
    glucosinolate biosynthesis., 'Total level and nature of the glucosinolate is determined
    early in the process, and the initial entry of methionine into the pathway is
    catalyzed by methylthioalkylmalate  synthase genes at the GS-ELONG loci.', MAM
    synthases catalyze the condensation of acetyl CoA to result in elongated methionine.,
  'Different members of this family may catalyze different number of rounds of elongation,
    with genetic variation at the GS-ELONG and GS-PRO loci enabling selection for
    different glucosinolate profiles, while allelic variation at the quantitative
    trait loci  determines overall amount.', Many of the glucosinolates found in Brassica
    vegetables are derived from chain elongated forms of methionine or phenylalanine.,
  'Figure 2B provides a genetic model of methionine-derived glucosinolate biosynthesis,
    with the total level and nature of the glucosinolate determined early in the process,
    and the initial entry of methionine into the pathway catalyzed by methylthioalkylmalate  synthase
    genes at the GS-ELONG loci.', 'MAM synthases catalyze the condensation of acetyl
    CoA as the methyl donor, with an -keto acid derived by amino-acid transanimation
    to result in elongated methionine.', 'Different members of this family may catalyze
    different number of rounds of elongation, with genetic variation at the GS-ELONG
    and GS-PRO loci enabling selection for different glucosinolate profiles, while
    allelic variation at the quantitative trait loci determines overall amount.',
  These initiating factors have been observed in both Arabidopsis and Brassica., 'In
    B. oleracea, these genes determine the length of the side chain with either one
    or two rounds of methionine elongation to produce 3C or 4C glucosinolates, respectively.',
  'Li and Quiros demonstrated that glucosinolate synthesis was independently regulated
    by genes GSL-PRO which determines the synthesis of 3C glucosinolates, and GSL-ELONG
    which determines synthesis of 4C glucosinolates.', 'Furthermore, MAM and a homologue
    protein of Arabidposis AOP2 were confirmed to be useful markers for breeding of
    high glucoraphanin varieties of B. oleracea.', 'Importantly, it was shown that
    the glucosinolate biosynthesis pathway may be manipulated toward the synthesis
    of glucoraphanin  by increasing the expression level of GSL-ELONG and reducing
    expression of GSL-PRO.', 'Studies in A. thaliana showed that the overexpression
    of R2R3-MYB transcription factors, including AtMYB28, AtMYB29, and/or AtMYB76,
    resulted in the upregulation of the glucosinolate biosynthetic genes and an increase
    in selected classes of glucosinolates.', 'Although genes involved in the regulation
    of glucosinolate biosynthesis have not yet been functionally identified in Brassica
    species, Araki et al.', suggest that gene homologues of AtMYB28 and AtMYB29 are
    important in B. oleracea., 'After biosynthesis, methionine-derived glucosinolates
    may undergo a number of side chain modifications, including hydroxylation, methoxylation,
    oxidation, desaturation, conjugation with benzoic acid, and glucosylation.', 'For
    example, methylthioalkyl glucosinolates may be converted to methylsulphinylalkyl
    glucosinolates by flavin monoxygenases at the GLS-OX loci.', 'In turn, these glucosinolates
    may be modified by 2-oxogluturate-dependent dioxygenases at the GLS-ALK loci and
    by an unknown enzyme at the GLS-OH loci to form alkenyl and hydroxyl-alkenylglucosinolates,
    respectively.', 'Due to the considerable variation at these loci in B. oleracea,
    selection for specific glucosinolate profiles may be possible with the genetic
    background being a major factor in determining glucoraphanin concentration and
    composition.', Brown et al., 'concluded that the percentage of glucosinolate variability
    in broccoli was attributable to genotype for individual compounds, including 54.2%
    for glucoraphanin.', High glucosinolate varieties of broccoli have been specifically
    bred to accumulate levels that are significantly higher than regular broccoli.,
  'The best example of deliberate breeding of such broccoli was achieved by crossing
    a standard cultivar with B.villosa, a wild form of B. oleracea from Sicily, which
    accumulates high levels of 3-methylthiopropyl glucosinolate.', 'This high glucosinolate
    variety of broccoli was shown to deliver about four times the amount of sulforaphane
    to the systemic circulation than standard cultivars, with sulforaphane metabolites
    consumed by GSTM1-positive subjects measured to be 107.5 M after consumption of
    regular broccoli compared with 345.8 M in subjects within the group who consumed
    the high-glucosinolate variety.', Table 2., 'Amount of Glucoraphanin Measured

    The significant accumulation of the glucosinolate, glucoraphanin  in broccoli
    has been shown to be important as the precursor of the bioactive isothiocyanate,
    sulforaphane.', 'It is rapidly absorbed, metabolized, and excreted, with 80% appearing
    in the urine within 1224 h after consumption and/or administration.', 'There are
    many factors that may affect the bioavailability, and therefore overall therapeutic
    benefit, of dietary sulforaphane, including pharmacokinetic properties, genetic
    variation, and food preparation.', Hydrolytic conversion of glucoraphanin to sulforaphane
    through the action of physical damage to the plant occurs either by the action
    of plant-derived myrosinase   or by the microbiota of the human colon., 'Approximately,
    60%80% of glucoraphanin is converted to sulforaphane, with most broccoli varieties
    possessing between 0.1 and 30 mol/g of glucoraphanin.', 'After rapid diffusion
    into the cells of the intestinal epithelium due to its lipophilic nature and low
    molecular weight, sulforaphane undergoes metabolism via the mercapturic acid pathway.',
  'This process involves its initial conjugation with glutathione, rapidly catalyzed
    by important glutathione S-transferase  enzymes.', FIG., '3.', 'The conversion
    of glucoraphanin to sulforaphane, and its subsequent metabolism.', 'Hydrolytic
    conversion of glucoraphanin to sulforaphane occurs through the action of physical
    damage to the plant, by either the action of plant-derived myrosinase  or the
    microbiota of the human colon.', 'After rapid diffusion into the cells of the
    intestinal epithelium, sulforaphane undergoes metabolism via the mercapturic acid
    pathway.', 'This process involves its initial conjugation with glutathione, rapidly
    catalyzed by important glutathione S-transferase  enzymes.', The process of N-acetylation  is
    important for the subsequent excretion of sulforaphane from the body., 'As previously
    described, GST enzymes are important in sulforaphane metabolism by their ability
    to conjugate the isothiocyanate to glutathione, leading to its excretion.', 'The
    GST isoforms, GST-M1 and GST-T1 have been reported to have the greatest activity
    on sulforaphane.', 'Genetic polymorphisms, as well as geographical and ethnic
    variations in genotype frequencies have been described for both GST-M1 and GST-T1,
    including null mutations, which result in the absence of a functional gene product.',
  'Interestingly, the frequency of a homozygous null genotype for both isoforms is
    relatively high, with the frequency of the GST-M1 null genotype varying between
    39% and 63%, and the GST-T1 null genotype between 10% and 21% for Caucasian populations,
    but it may be as high as 64% in subjects of Asian descent.', 'The implication
    of a homozygous null genotype has been shown to be an important variable that
    determines the biodistribution, and therefore the protective effect of broccoli
    consumption in human populations.', 'Epidemiological studies, however, have reported
    conflicting results with regard to the association between genetic polymorphisms
    in GST isoforms and cancer risk.', 'For example, some studies have concluded that
    GST-M1-positive subjects gain greater cancer protection from either broccoli consumption
    or total cruciferous vegetable consumption than those who possess the GST-M1 null
    genotype.', 'In contrast, others report that consumption of cruciferous vegetables
    leads to a greater protective effect in GST-M1 and GST-T1 null subjects than those
    with functional GST enzymes.', 'This variation, however, may be explained through
    the innate biological function of GST enzymes and their role in the metabolism
    and subsequent elimination of various compounds after exposure.', 'Specifically,
    molecular epidemiological studies involved in elucidating the association between
    GST-M1 and GST-T1 genotypes with cancer susceptibility have shown that those who
    carry the homozygous deletion appear to have a small increase in the magnitude
    of risk ; however, other factors  further enhance the risk.', 'This is accounted
    to their ability to regulate the conjugation of carcinogenic compounds, including
    benzopyrene and styrene-7,8-oxide by GST-M1, and ethylene oxide and methyl bromide
    by GST-T1, to excretable hydrophilic metabolites.', 'Through the inability to
    express functional GST enzymes, individuals possessing the homozygous null genotype
    have a limited capacity to efficiently detoxify potentially carcinogenic exposures.',
  'Thus, the consumption of cruciferous vegetables may have limited protection in
    such subjects, as chronic exposure to carcinogens causes a reduction in their
    preventative activity.', 'Conversely, studies that report an enhanced protective
    effect of sulforaphane in GST-M1 and GST-T1 null genotypes hypothesize that due
    to the inability to efficiently metabolize sulforaphane for urinary excretion,
    exposure of target tissues to the protective compound and/or metabolites is higher
    and prolonged.', 'The sulforaphane metabolites produced in such a pathway are
    distributed throughout the body and accumulate in different tissues, with unpublished
    data from Franklin and co-workers after a whole body autoradiographic study in
    rats suggesting that high concentrations of isothiocyanate metabolites are present
    in the gastrointestinal tract, liver, kidneys, and blood.', 'The basis for the
    distribution of sulforaphane is the high degree of binding to glutathione, and
    its capacity to drive passive diffusion.', 'Due to analytical limitations, a few
    studies have successfully measured the distribution of sulforaphane and its metabolites
    in humans.', 'Results from human studies demonstrated that 74%  of sulforaphane
    from broccoli extracts may be absorbed in the jejunum, with a portion returning
    to the intestinal lumen of jejunum as sulforaphane-glutathione.The amount of sulforaphane
    metabolites in plasma, however, may reflect the amount of sulforaphane exposed
    to tissues, and are, therefore, considered important biomarkers in the determination
    of distribution.', 'In plasma, more than 50% of total sulforaphane metabolites
    were sulforaphane-glutathione with free sulforaphane, although other metabolites,
    including sulforaphane-N-acetylcysteine, were present in quantifiable amounts.',
  'For example, in rats, after a single dose of  sulforaphane, detectable levels of
    the compound were evident after 1 h, peaking at 20 M at 4 h with a half life of
    2.2 h. Ye et al.', 'have shown a rapid absorption and appearance of isothiocyanates
    and their metabolites in the blood of human subjects, with this level observed
    to decline after first-order kinetics.', 'These subjects were given a single dose
    of 200 mol broccoli sprouts isothiocyanate preparation, with isothiocyanate plasma
    concentrations peaking between 0.943 and 2.27 M 1 h post exposure, with a half
    life calculated at 1.77 h. Subsequent accumulation after distribution within target
    tissue is also an important aspect in the context of sulforaphane and its ability
    to elicit chemopreventive and anticancer effects.', 'In an in vivo study in mice
    given 300 or 600 ppm sulforaphane, accumulated sulforaphane and sulforaphane-glutathione
    plasma concentrations were recorded at 124254 nM and 579770 nM, respectively.',
  'Concentrations within the small intestine were also measured, and they were between
    313 nmol/g of tissue and 1432 nmol/g of tissue, respectively.', 'Interestingly,
    the accumulation of sulforaphane within the colonic tissue of treated mice corresponded
    with decreased adenoma formation.', Detoxification genes NQO1 and heme oxygenase-1  were
    also detected in the removed tissue., 'In addition, the rapid passage of a bolus
    of preformed sulforaphane in rats did not achieve equal distribution across all
    tissues, with the highest levels reached in the stomach wall.', 'Sulforaphane
    distribution was decreased in more distal parts of the digestive tract, with the
    rectum accumulating 1% of that found in the stomach.', 'At 24 h post administration,
    however, levels were low and approximately equal in all evaluated tissue, indicating
    the rapidity of sulforaphane metabolism and excretion.', 'A study of human breast
    tissue after consumption of broccoli sprouts, however, showed that the tissue
    concentration of isothiocyanates failed to be different from plasma levels.',
  The kidney is the major organ involved in the conversion of glutathione conjugates
    into the corresponding N-acetyl-S-cysteine conjugates., The process of N-acetylation
    is important for the subsequent excretion of isothiocyanates from the body., 'Excretion
    of sulforaphane and its metabolites have been shown to follow first-order kinetics,
    with most data indicating clearance from the body within 72 h of administration.',
  'Glucoraphanin is relatively stable under chemical and thermal conditions, and,
    therefore, hydrolysis is mainly enzymatic.', 'Cooking and/or blanching  of cruciferous
    vegetables inactivates myrosinase, and has been shown to decrease the bioavailability
    of sulforaphane.', 'In general, results suggest that only about 30%50% of the
    initial administered dose is excreted after these preparation processes.', 'Boiling
    for more than 1 min, or steaming for more than 45 min has been shown to lead to
    the loss of myrosinase activity.', Conaway et al., performed a study to assess
    the metabolic fate of glucosinolates after ingestion of steamed and fresh broccoli
    in 12 male subjects in a crossover design., Results of this study indicate that
    the bioavailability of sulforaphane from fresh broccoli is approximately thrice
    higher than that from cooked broccoli., 'Interestingly, coadministration of semi-purified
    glucoraphanin with a myrosinase source was reported to increase the bioavailability
    of the isothiocyanate.', 'In addition, the concentration of glucoraphanin varies
    widely among development stages of the plant, and between different parts of the
    plant, which may also influence sulforaphane bioavailability.', 'For example,
    two varieties of broccoli, a purple-sprouting broccoli and a green-sprouting broccoli,
    were cultivated to compare the amount of sulforaphane and its metabolites within
    commercial samples.', 'In the initial samples, it was shown that there were quantitative
    differences between organs, with the seeds, edible sprouts, and florets determined
    to possess the most intact sulforaphane.', 'Furthermore, these two varieties produced
    higher sulforaphane levels compared with those within the commercial samples.',
  'Higher sulforaphane concentrations were also found in the initial steps of the
    digestion process, with the concentration of sulforaphane and its subsequent metabolites
    decreased in accordance with the amount of precursor glucoraphanin.', 'The concentration
    of sulforaphane required to observe therapeutic activity has not yet been determined
    in human clinical trials, with rough estimates based on the active dose in animal
    models.', The amount of dietary glucoraphanin that is converted to bioavailable
    sulforaphane is typically calculated as 20% of the overall consumed amount in
    humans., 'For example, the typical sulforaphane concentration that has been shown
    to inhibit the growth of human cancer xenografts in mice is 4.4 mg/kg per day.',
  This corresponds to 308 mg of sulforaphane daily administered to a 70 kg person.,

    Chemoprevention, which refers to the use of a nontoxic natural or synthetic chemical
    that possesses the capacity to intervene in multistage carcinogenesis, has emerged
    as a promising approach to reduce the risk of the development and progression
    of malignancy.', 'Microarray analyses in cell lines, animal tissue, and human
    biopsy samples have shown the capacity of sulforaphane to modulate global gene
    expression, especially resulting in the differential expression of genes that
    are important in chemoprevention.', 'In general, results indicate that sulforaphane
    affects the expression of genes involved in xenobiotic metabolism, antioxidation,
    cell cycle regulation, apoptotic pathways, and stress response.', Table 3., 'Summary
    of Findings from Microarray Analyses Aimed at Assessing the Effect of Sulforaphane
    on Global Gene Expression


    Evidence suggests that sulforaphane, its metabolites, and synthetic analogues
    possess the capacity to inhibit the malignant transformation of various cell types,
    and limit cancer progression after carcinogen exposure.', 'For example, sulforaphane
    and its conjugate metabolite N-acetylcysteine was shown to limit the malignant
    progression of lung adenomas in A/J mice exposed to tobacco carcinogens.', 'Prevention
    of mutagenesis by sulforaphane was also demonstrated in mice given a single application
    of the sulfur mustard analogue, 2- ethyl sulphide.', Abel et al., 'reported that
    a single topical treatment with sulforaphane induced the production of phase II
    detoxification enzymes, with an increase in the epidermal levels of the regulatory
    subunit of glutamate-cysteine ligase, and reduced glutathione.', 'Furthermore,
    sulforaphane treatment limited the CEES-induced increase in mutation frequency
    in the skin, which was measured at 4 days post exposure.', 'A reduction in the
    number, size, and development of mammary tumors in rats after exposure to the
    carcinogen dimethylbenzanthracene has also been observed with sulforaphane treatment.',
  'Furthermore, sulforaphane possessed an ability to decrease the amount of DNA-adduct
    formation in normal mammary cells exposed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.',
  'Inhibition of DNA-adduct formation has also been displayed in human bladder cells
    in vitro and in mouse bladder tissue in vivo, after treatment with sulforaphane
    and exposure to the bladder carcinogen, 4-aminobiphenyl.', 'This inhibition was
    dependent on the activation of an important chemoprotective signaling pathway,
    nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2, within the epithelium, which is the
    main site for bladder cancer development.', 'Exposure to benzopyrene results in
    the induction of pulmonary carcinogenesis in mice via oxidative damage, with sulforaphane
    treatment found to decrease the production of H2O2.', 'Results suggest that sulforaphane
    leads to the activation of apoptotic pathways in this experimental model of chemical
    lung carcinogenesis, included the increased release of cytochrome c from mitochondria,
    enhanced caspase-3 activity leading to DNA fragmentation, and a decrease in Bcl-2
    expression coupled with an increase in the expression of Bax.', 'Interestingly,
    sulforaphane was shown to protect primary dermal fibroblasts and keratinocytes
    against oxidative stress caused by UVA radiation under basal conditions and in
    the presence of the photosensitising drug, 6-thioguanine.', 'In this study, sulforaphane
    treatment resulted in an 50% reduction in the formation of reactive oxygen species.',
  'Furthermore, the protective properties of sulforaphane were shown to be caused
    by an increase in Nrf2-depednent cytoprotective responses, including those involved
    in the induction of gene transcription and expression of important metabolic and
    detoxification enzymes.', 'The chemopreventive activity of sulforaphane in carcinogenesis
    is related to the inhibition of phase I enzymes, which are responsible for the
    activation of pro-carcinogens  and the induction of phase II enzymes that are
    responsible for mutagen elimination.', Phase I enzymes such as cytochrome p450  are
    important in the transformation and bioactivation of pro-carcinogens to carcinogens.,
  'Through common enzymatic processes, electrophilic intermediates covalently bind
    to nucleophilic sites in important macromolecules.', 'Adduct formation, coupled
    with inadequate reparation, may, in turn, cause miscoding and mutations in critical
    genes to initiate carcinogenesis.', Multiple studies have reported the capacity
    of sulforaphane to inhibit the catalytic activity of phase I enzymes., 'Specifically,
    Barcelo et al.', reported the dose-dependent inhibition of both cytochrome p450-1A1
    and -2B1/2 enzymatic activity in rat hepatocytes after sulforaphane treatment.,
  'Similar results were also found in human hepatocytes, with sulforaphane significantly
    decreasing the expression of CYP1A1, 1A2, and CYP3A4 genes.', 'Evidence also suggests
    that sulforaphane is an effective antagonist of the human steroid and xenobiotic
    receptor, which is an important transcriptional factor that regulates the expression
    of CYP3A genes.', 'In primary rat hepatocytes, sulforaphane caused a significant
    inhibition of the microsomal ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase  activity  and P-benzoquinone
    dioxime  activity.', 'Cells possess innate protective mechanisms in order to minimize
    damage caused by highly reactive metabolites, with the induction of phase II enzymes
    that are of major importance in detoxification.', 'These enzymes include GST,
    NADH:quinine oxidoreductase, and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase.', 'Phase II enzymes
    are potent antioxidants that have a relatively long half life, and have the capacity
    to conjugate endogenous substrates such as glutathione to phase I metabolites
    in order to limit further biotransformation and result in enhanced elimination
    and excretion.', Evidence suggests that sulforaphane is a potent inducer of phase
    II antioxidant enzymes., 'For example, sulforaphane significantly reduced the
    number and level of DNA adducts after exposure to methyl-6-phenylimidazopyridine
    in a dose-dependent manner in hepatocytes due to the induction of GST-A1 and UGT-1A1
    mRNA expression.', 'NQO-1 and GST activity was also shown to be enhanced in the
    forestomach, duodenum, and bladder of rats treated with 40 mol of sulforaphane
    per kg, while an increased dose of 2001000 mol of sulforaphane per kg increased
    activity in the liver, colon, and pancreas.', 'Jones and Brooks demonstrated an
    increase in enzymatic activity in prostate, liver, kidney, and bladder tissues
    after administration of sulforaphane.', Human clinical studies also provide evidence
    for the induction of phase II enzymes by sulforaphane after broccoli consumption.,
  Table 4., 'Human Clinical Studies Involving the Consumption of Broccoli and Sulforaphane-Induced
    Production of Phase II Enzymes


    The induction of phase II enzymes by sulforaphane has been shown to be associated
    with a disruption of Nrf2-Keap1 interactions and increased translocation of Nrf2.',
  'In unstimulated cells, Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1  mediates the function
    of Nrf2 through sequestration mechanisms in order to bind it to Cul-3-dependent
    ubiquitinase for subsequent ubiquitination and targeted proteosomal degradation.',
  'After stimulation due to environmental insult, the Nrf2-Keap1 complex is disrupted
    with conformational changes, leading to a switch in ubiquitination from Nrf2 to
    Keap1, and the nuclear translocation of Nrf2.', Activation of Nrf2 in the nucleus
    occurs through its heterodimerization with small Maf transcription factors to
    form a complex that binds to the antioxidant/electrophile response element  that
    is found in the promoters of many phase II enzymes., Sulforaphane has the ability
    to induce nuclear translocation of Nrf2 through the disruption of the Nrf2-Keap1
    complex via the degradative loss of Keap1 via conformational changes., 'Specifically,
    sulforaphane has been demonstrated, with the use of spectroscopic evidence, to
    react with the thiol groups of Keap1 to form thionoacyl adducts.', 'This specific
    modification of Keap1 released Nrf2 from sequestration, promoting the subsequent
    activation of ARE-driven gene expression.', Conceptual proof of this action by
    sulforaphane has been shown through experiments in Nrf2 knockout mice., Thimmulappa
    et al., generated a transcriptional profile of the small intestine of wild-type  and
    knockout  mice treated with sulforaphane., 'Numerous genes were found to be regulated

    In addition, evidence suggests that sulforaphane possesses the capacity to limit
    the progression of tumor development through a number of mechanisms, including
    activation of apoptosis, NFB pathway inhibition, and cell cycle arrest induction.',
  FIG., '5.', Summary of chemopreventive mechanisms involved in limiting tumor progression
    after sulforaphane exposure., 'Both in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated
    that sulforaphane possesses the capacity to activate apoptotic pathways, induce
    cell cycle arrest, inhibit NFB signaling, and stimulate MAPK activity.', Apoptosis
    or programmed cell death is an important and selective mechanism in the regulation
    of cell proliferation in both physiological and pathological conditions., 'The
    activation of apoptotic pathways in malignant cells is a major focus for current
    cancer therapeutic research, with evidence suggesting that sulforaphane possesses
    the capacity to induce apoptosis through the activation of several proapoptotic
    pathways.', 'For example, sulforaphane induced apoptotsis in both human cervical
    HeLa cancer and hepatocellular HepG2 carcinoma cell lines in vitro, demonstrated
    by the formation of apoptotic bodies and the accumulation of cells in the sub-G1
    phase.', Administration of 10 M sulforaphane reduced cell viability and induced
    apoptosis in prostate DU145 cancer cells as indicated by the cleavage of poly
    polymerase  and increased release of histone-associated DNA fragments., 'In HCT-116
    colon cancer cells, 15 M sulforaphane induced activation of pro-apoptotic caspase-7
    and caspase-9, independent of p53 expression.', 'Recently, sulforaphane-induced
    apoptotis was also associated with the activation of caspase-8 and caspase-9,
    the initiating caspases that are important in both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic
    pathways in human bladder 5637 cancer cells.', Park et al., 'also reported the
    ability of sulforaphane to affect important molecular targets that are intimately
    involved in apoptotic pathways, including the downregulation of anti-apoptotic
    Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL gene expression, the upregulated expression of pro-apoptotic
    Bax, proteolytic activation of caspase-3, and the degradation/cleavage of PARP.',
  'The activation of Bax, the downregulation of the inhibitors of apoptosis  protein
    family, and the induction of apoptotic protease activating factor-1 have been
    shown to be involved in the regulation of sulforaphane-induced cell death.', 'A
    study using Jurkat T-leukemia cells suggests that vulnerability to sulforaphane-mediated
    apoptosis was dependent on cell-cycle mechanisms, with cells most sensitive to
    sulforaphane-induced apoptosis in the G1 phase, less sensitive in the G2/M phase,
    and least sensitive during the S phase.', 'The proposed initiating signal of sulforaphane-mediated
    apoptosis is the formation of ROS and the disruption of mitochondrial membrane
    potential, leading to cytosolic release of cytochrome c via both death-receptor
    and mitochondrial caspase cascade pathways, as observed in human prostate cancer
    PC3 cells.', 'More specifically, sulforaphane was capable of inducing apoptosis
    through the activation of the ROS-dependent, caspase-3 in multiple tumor necrosis
    factor--resistant leukemia cell lines.', 'Interestingly, administration of the
    antioxidant N-acetylcysteine and the overexpression of catalase resulted in the
    reversal of sulforaphane-induced ROS formation in the same study.', 'Singh and
    co-workers thus indicated a necessity for the conjugation of sulforaphane with
    glutathione during metabolism, in order to deplete intracellular concentrations
    of glutathione and potentially lower the oxidative stress threshold of cells.',
  'In general, high concentrations of sulforaphane are required in order to induce
    ROS formation.', 'For example, mitochondrial ROS generation and disruption of
    mitochondrial membrane potential leading to the formation of acidic vesicular
    organelles and autophagy in PC3 and LNCap cells may only be observed after administration
    of 40 M sulforaphane.', This response has unique morphological effects and was
    shown to possess the ability to inhibit the release of mitochondrial cytochrome
    c and apoptosis., 'Therefore, it has been suggested that ROS production after
    sulforaphane treatment has the capacity to influence cell death in an alternative
    pathway to apoptosis.', 'While activation of apoptosis by sulforaphane in the
    human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells was reported to be initiated through the
    induction of Fas ligand, which resulted in the activation of caspase-8, caspase-3,
    and PARP, sulforaphane induced apoptosis in the human breast cancer cell lines,
    MDA-MB-468, MCF-7, and T47 via mechanisms involved with decreased Bcl-2 expression,
    release of cytochrome c into the cytosol, activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3,
    and poly polyermase cleavage.', 'Taken together, these findings indicate that
    sulforaphane has an innate ability to modulate both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic
    pathways, via the production of ROS and regulation of gene expression.', 'In contrast
    to the well-documented induction of apoptotic pathways by sulforaphane, recent
    studies have indicated that sulforaphane may also possess the capacity to cause
    autophagy in cancer cells.', 'The significance of these findings is displayed
    in the publication by Herman-Antosiewicz et al., which associated the induction
    of autophagy with the inhibition of cytochrome c release and, ultimately, apoptosis.',
  'In this study, treatment of prostate cancer cell lines, PC-3 and LNCap with sulforaphane
    resulted in the upregulation, processing, and recruitment to autophagosomes of
    microtubule-associated protein light chain 3.', 'In addition, inhibition of autophagy  potentiated
    the proapoptotic effects of sulforaphane in human colon cancer cells.', 'Similar
    results were also demonstrated in human breast cancer cell lines, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231.',
  Investigation providing mechanistic insights indicates that autophagy and cell death
    signaling after sulforaphane treatment of pancreatic cells are independent pathways
    which depend on ROS production., 'Pharmacologic inhibition of autophagy in vivo
    validated cell culture studies, with most suggesting that autophagy is a cytoprotective
    mechanism against sulforaphane-induced apoptosis.', 'Inhibition of cellular growth
    may also be caused by an irreversible arrest during the cell cycle, with sulforaphane
    shown to possess such inhibitory effects on cells.', A significant increase in
    G2/M cell cycle arrest was observed in LNCap prostate cancer cells after sulforaphane
    incubation in a concentration- and time-dependent manner., A reduction in cell
    viability after the induction of G2/M cell cycle arrest after treatment of DU145
    prostate cancer cells with 10 M sulforaphane has also been demonstrated., 'In
    human ovarian PA-1 cancer cells treated with sulforaphane, an accumulation in
    the G2/M  phase was reported through the downregulation of CDC2, as well as through
    the downregulation and dissociation of the cyclinB1/CDC2 complex.', 'A decrease
    in protein levels of cyclin B1, cell division cycle Cdc25B, Cdc25C, and an accumulation
    of Tyr-15-phosphorylated  Cdk1 has also shown to be important in sulforaphane-mediated
    cell cycle arrest in PC3 cells after incubation with 20 M sulforaphane.', 'In
    addition, sulforaphane treatment resulted in a rapid and sustained phosphorylation
    of Cdc25C at Ser-216, which was a result of Chk2 activation, leading to translocation
    of Cdc25C from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, and increased binding to 143-3beta.',
  It is thus proposed that Chk2-mediated phosphorylation of Cdc25C is an important
    regulation mechanism in irreversible sulforaphane-induced G2/M arrest., The tumor
    suppressor and cell cycle inhibitor protein p21 also appears to play an important
    role in sulforaphane-induced cell cycle arrest with its induction observed in
    a number of studies irrespective of cell type and expression of p53., Sulforaphane
    treatment of p53 negative colon cancer cell lines  was shown to induce p21 expression.,
  'In LNCap prostate cancer cells, induction of p53 and p21 was observed after 20
    M sulforaphane treatment.', 'Interestingly, cell cycle arrest in LNCap cells occurred
    after the p21 expression induction but not p53.', 'In this same study, induction
    of p21 expression by sulforaphane was shown to occur in p53-null PC3 prostate
    cancer cells, suggesting a possible p53-independent regulatory pathway.', Treatment
    of acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells from human patients with sulforaphane resulted
    in dose-dependent apoptosis and G2/M cell cycle arrest., 'These anticancer mechanisms
    were associated with the activation of caspases, inactivation of PARP, p53-independent
    upregulation of p21, and inhibition of the CDC2/cyclin B1 complex.', 'Colon tissue
    surgically removed from three human subjects treated with sulforaphane for 2 h
    exhibited a strong induction of p21 in cancer tissue, with expression failing
    to be significant in the normal tissue of two patients.', 'Although G2/M arrest
    is the predominant stage of cell cycle arrest induced by sulforaphane, arrest
    at other phases of the cell cycle has been observed.', 'For example, a G1 cell
    cycle arrest was shown to occur in HT-29 cells concomitant with an increase in
    p21CIP1, and a decrease in cyclin D1, cyclin A, and c-myc.', G1/S cell cycle arrest
    has also been reported in LNCap and DU145 cells., Evidence suggests that the phase
    in which cell cycle arrest occurs after sulforaphane treatment is dependent on
    administered concentration and incubation time., 'In human colon adenocarcinoma
    Caco-2 cells, G2/M cell cycle arrest was observed at a dose of 20 M sulforaphane.',
  'Conversely, administration of sulforaphane at concentrations &gt;20 M induced an
    accumulation of sub-G1 cells and the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential.',
  Pappa et al., 'demonstrated reversible G2/M cycle arrest and cytostatic growth of
    p53 wild-type 4016 colon cancer cells after transient exposure till 6 h. Treatment
    with sulforaphane for longer than 12 h, however, resulted in irreversible G2/M
    arrest and subsequent apoptosis.', 'Interestingly, cytostatic growth effects observed
    with 12 h of exposure was sustained till 72 h post sulforaphane removal and the
    IC50 calculated was comparable to cells transiently exposed to sulforaphane for
    72 h.


    Mitogen-activated protein kinases, including the extracellular signal-regulated
    kinases, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases, and p38, are believed to be involved in carcinogenesis
    and tumor progression.', 'The activation of the MAPK/ERK pathway has been reported
    after sulforaphane treatment in a number of cell lines, including PC3 cells, through
    the activation of the activator protein-1  transcription factor that is involved
    in the regulation of cell death.', The modulatory effect on AP-1 transcription
    is dependent on the concentration of sulforaphane administered., 'In HT-29 colon
    cancer cells, activation of AP-1 luciferase activity occurred at low concentrations
    of sulforaphane treatment, while activity was inhibited at high concentrations.',
  'In addition, cyclin D1 levels increased at lower concentrations, and decreased
    at high concentrations.', 'Interestingly, however, is that despite the difference
    in modulation after varying concentrations of sulforaphane, cell viability decreased
    in a dose-dependent manner.', 'Administration of 50 M sulforaphane in cells corresponded
    to activation of the 46-kDa isoform of phospho-JNK  but not the p54-JNK isoform,
    indicating the importance of the 54-kDa isoform for persistent activation of AP-1.',
  'Consistent with this report, Shen et al.', also observed a decrease in cell viability
    and the activation of MAPK pathways., 'Furthermore, activated JNK was shown to
    decrease cyclin D1 expression at high concentrations of administered sulforaphane.',
  'The treatment of Caco-2 human colon adenocarcinoma cells with sulforaphane was
    shown to induce ERK activation, but failed to significantly increase the activation
    of JNK and p38.', 'In another study, DU-145 prostate cancer cells were exposed
    to sulforaphane with the activation of the JNK pathway shown to be important in
    cell death induction.', 'Activation of p38 was also shown to be important in the
    upregulation of Nrf2-ARE-driven enzymes, and the downregulation of pro-inflammatory
    COX-2 in human bladder T24 cancer cells.', 'The MAPK pathway is, therefore, an
    important mechanism activated by sulforaphane, and indirectly contributes to cell
    death and cell viability regulation, as well as to Nrf2-Keap1 interactions and
    the transcription of phase II antioxidant enzymes.', 'Nuclear factor B  and its
    active role in inflammation, cancer cell survival, and progression has been widely
    reported, with the ability to bind to the promoter of many pro-inflammatory genes,
    including inducible nitric oxide synthase, cyclooxygenase-2, and tumor necrosis
    factor.', 'After incubation of PC3 cells with 20 M sulforaphane for 1 h, a reduction
    in nuclear localization of p65-NFB was observed.', 'In addition, inhibition of
    NFB transcriptional activity in PC3 cells resulted in the suppression of the nuclear
    translocation of p65 and the decreased gene expression of NFB-regulated VEGF,
    cyclin D1, and Bcl-xL.', 'The decreased nuclear translocation and activation of
    p65-NFB was attributed to the inhibition of IB kinase  phosphorylation, which
    is necessary for IB degradation, and subsequent release of inactive NFB to become
    active.', Similar effects are observed in HT-29 cells in a dose-dependent manner.,
  'Interestingly, an initial increase in NFB activity at 612 h post sulforaphane treatment
    in LNCap cells has also been observed, followed by inhibition at the 24 h time
    point.', 'In this same study, the modulation of the IAP family, downstream factors
    that are shown to be upregulated by NFB activation, was directly proportional
    to the level of NFB activity.', 'Studies also suggest that sulforaphane has the
    capacity to reduce the DNA binding ability of NFB directly, with two mechanisms
    proposed.', 'The first involves the modification of NFB subunits via thiol-dependent
    interactions to cause dithiocarbamate formation and the direct binding to essential
    cysteine  residues of NFB, thereby decreasing the capacity to bind to nuclear
    DNA.', 'The other suggests that sulforaphane may interact with glutathione and
    other redox regulators such as thioredoxin or redox factor-1, which, in turn,
    indirectly interferes with NFB-DNA binding.', Sulforaphane has been identified
    as an inhibitor of the thioredoxin/thioredoxin reductase  enzymatic activity in
    vitro., Findings also suggest that the inhibition of 12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate
    -induced matrix metalloproteinase-9  expression and cell invasion by sulforaphane
    is mediated by the suppression of the NFB pathway in human breast MCF-7 cancer
    cells., 'Furthermore, the selective inhibition of NFB by sulforaphane has been
    demonstrated in receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand -induced osteoclastogenesis
    through the interaction with the thiol groups of NFB.', 'Coactivators of NFB may
    also be affected by sulforaphane, including CCAAT-enhancer-binding proteins, cAMP
    response element-binding protein, and AP-1.', 'Woo and Kwon demonstrated the capacity
    of sulforaphane to inhibit such coactivators, and, ultimately, its indirect ability
    to downregulate the expression of pro-inflammatory COX-2.', 'Despite the evidence,
    the inactivation of the NFB pathway by sulforaphane requires further elucidation
    to determine its impact as an important molecular chemopreventative mechanism.',
  The regulation of endogenous receptor expression in selected cells may also be an
    important chemopreventative mechanism of sulforaphane., 'For example, sulforaphane
    has been shown to inhibit the expression of estrogen receptor alpha  in the human
    MCF-7 breast cancer cell line due to an inhibition of ER mRNA transcription as
    well as due to increased proteosome-mediated degradation.', These data suggest
    that sulforaphane has the potential to inhibit cancer cell proliferation caused
    by aberrant hormone ER receptor expression in MCF-7 cells., 'In addition, sulforaphane
    significantly increased the reactivation of ER expression in ER-negative breast
    cancer cells, and was consistently correlated with ER promoter hypomethylation
    and hyperacetylation.', Treatment of Caco-2 cells with sulforaphane for 48 h also
    led to the downregulation of serotonin receptor 5-HT to undetectable levels as
    compared with the control., 'The ability of sulforaphane to sensitize drug-resistant
    cancer cells to tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand -induced
    apoptosis has been demonstrated in multiple studies, with reports demonstrating
    sulforaphane-enhanced TRAIL-induced apoptosis in human osteosarcoma cells  and
    hepatoma cells.', 'The induction of cell death in various tumor cell lines by
    sulforaphane was coupled with increased p53, activated caspase-3 proteins, and
    decreased hypoxia-inducible factor-1 activation under hypoxic conditions.', It
    was also shown that sulforphane may mediate sensitization to TRAIL-induced apoptosis
    through the upregulation of death receptor 5  mRNA and protein expression., 'Recently,
    the ability of sulforaphane to modulate toll-like receptor  activation and signaling
    has been implicated as an additional chemopreventive property.', 'TLRs recognize
    specific patterns derived from invading microorganisms and pathogens, or damaged
    cells and tissues to elicit the innate and/or adaptive immune response.', Zhu
    et al., 'observed that sulforaphane caused inhibition of TLR3, with the ability
    to modulate NFB signaling and downstream gene expression, including the downregulation
    of IL-8 and TNF-.', 'Sulforaphane has also been reported to form adducts with
    cysteine residues in the extracellular domain of TLR4, which results in the inhibition
    of TLR4 dimerization in a thiol-dependent manner.', 'In addition, sulforaphane
    interfered with the binding of lipopolysaccharide to myeloid differentiation 2  by
    its ability to preferentially bind to the cysteine 133 residue in the hydrophobic
    pocket of MD2.', 'Although this inhibition is important for the attenuation of
    the inflammatory response, modulation of downstream mechanisms to TLR signaling
    may also limit the progression of cancer.', 'Specifically, sulforaphane inhibited
    the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and vascular cell adhesion

    Most recently, tumor heterogeneity has been considered to arise through the aberrant
    differentiation of cancer cells, as well as a result of continuing mutagenesis.',
  The existence of cancer cells with stem cell-like properties in a number of cancer
    types has recently been identified., 'It is proposed that the growth of a tumor
    is driven by a small population of cancer cells, which have the ability to undergo
    self-renewal, and may be responsible for tumor relapse, metastasis, and resistance.',
  'A number of studies have suggested that sulforaphane possesses the capacity to
    target cancer stem cells through direct and indirect mechanisms, alone or in combination
    with other anticancer compounds.', 'As previously described, sulforaphane is able
    to attenuate NFB activity and nuclear translocation of the NFB subunit, resulting
    in decreased expression of NFB-regulated genes.', Kallifatidis et al., demonstrated
    the ability of sulforaphane to abrogate the resistance of pancreatic tumor-initiating
    cells to TRAIL by interfering with TRAIL-activated NFB signaling., 'Specifically,
    sulforaphane reduced the DNA binding capacity of transactivation-competent NFB
    dimers that were found in a tumor initiating cell-enriched cell population.',
  'Thus, sulforaphane was shown to impair the expression of NFB target genes with
    antiapoptotic effects.', 'In addition, the sonic hedgehog  signaling pathway is
    linked to NFB signaling, with reports of an overexpression of SHH activated by
    NFB in pancreatic cancer.', 'After sulforaphane treatment, inhibition of SHH signaling
    has been demonstrated, and may contribute to the regulation of the self-renewal
    capacity of human pancreatic cancer stem cells.', 'In an in vitro model, sulforaphane
    was shown to inhibit the SHH signaling pathway, and reduced the expression of
    Smo, Gli1, and Gli2.', Sulforaphane was also shown to inhibit the nuclear translocation
    and transcriptional activity of Gli1 and Gli2 in a dose-dependent manner., 'After
    treatment for 1 week, the formation of human pancreatic cancer stem cell-derived
    spheres was significantly inhibited, suggesting the clonogenic depletion of the
    cancer stem cells.', 'Similarly, sulforaphane treatment resulted in a significant
    reduction in the tumor growth of orthotopically impanted primary pancreatic cancer
    stem cells isolated from human pancreatic tumors into the pancreas of mice in
    vivo.', 'Through the modulation of SHH signaling, decreased expression of downstream
    target genes  was also demonstrated.', 'The epithelial-mesenchymal transition,
    which is of critical importance in tumorgenesis and metastasis, has also been
    shown to be modulated after sulforaphane treatment with the downregulation of
    EMT markers, including ZEB-1, Twist-1, and vimentin.', 'Consistent with this finding,
    sulforaphane was shown to inhibit the EMT process via COX2/MMP2,9/ZEB1, Snail,
    and miR-200c/ZEB1 pathways, and possessed the ability to suppress metastasis in
    human bladder cancer cells.', 'Several studies have also shown that sulforaphane
    may inhibit the pro-survival PI3K/Akt pathway, which has been implicated in cellular
    survival and growth, and resistance.', 'Sulforaphane alone and in combination
    with quercetin suppressed the growth of pancreatic cancer stem cells derived from
    pancreatic cancer cell lines in vitro, through the inhibition of the PI3K/Akt
    and MAPK/ERK pathways.', '-catenin, an important protein subunit of the cadherin
    protein complex and that functions as an intracellular signal transducer in the
    Wnt signaling pathway, has been shown to be important in the self-renewal of cancer
    stem cells and in the EMT process.', 'In the human cervical carcinoma  and hepatocarcinoma  cell
    lines, sulforaphane has displayed a capacity to induce the downregulation of -catenin.',
  Li et al., evaluated the effect of sulforaphane on breast cancer stem cells with
    profound implications., 'Sulforaphane  decreased aldehyde dehydrogenase -positive
    cell population by 65%80%, and reduced the size and number of primary mammospheres
    by 8- to 125-fold and 45%75%, respectively, in vitro.', A daily injection with
    50 mg/kg sulforaphane for 2 weeks in nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient
    xenograft mice reduced the ADH-positive cell population by &gt;50%., 'Sulforphane
    successfully eliminated breast cancer stem cells in vivo, thereby limiting tumor
    growth after implantation of primary tumor cells into secondary mice.', 'Through
    Western blotting analysis and -catenin reporter assay results, sulforaphane was
    shown to promote -catenin phosphorylation and its subsequent degradation.', 'It
    was thus proposed that the inhibition of breast cancer stem cells was caused,
    at least in part, by the downregulation of the Wnt/-catenin self-renewal pathway.',
  'Due to the finding that sulforaphane may possess therapeutic potential against
    cancer stem cells, its use in combination with clinically relevant drugs that
    limit tumor growth through its toxicity to differentiated stem cells may overcome
    limitations observed in current cancer management strategies, including resistance
    and reoccurrence.', Kallifatidis et al., 'also demonstrated that sulforaphane
    enhanced the toxicity of various cytotoxic compounds, including cisplatin, gemcitabine,
    doxorubicin, and 5-flurouracil, toward pancreatic and prostate cancer stem cells.',
  'Sulforaphane increased the chemotherapeutic effects on self-renewal and ALDH activity,
    while limiting toxicity in normal cells.', 'Significantly, the combination therapy
    abrogated tumor-initiating potential in vivo, with no adverse effects reported.',

    The modulation of the epigenome is critical in the development and progression
    of cancer, contributing to the malignant transformation of cells through the ability
    to regulate gene expression without modifying the underlying DNA sequence.', 'Dysregulated
    epigenetic processes, including aberrant DNA methylation, histone modifications,
    and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression by noncoding microRNA,

    targets for cancer prevention and management strategies.', 'Dietary isothiocyanates,

    in order to completely elucidate the significance of sulforaphane in the regulation
    of epigenetic changes, including its ability to modulate microRNA expression.',
  'In general, the addition of acetyl groups to histones by histone acetyltransferase  promote
    gene expression through the ability to create an open chromatin conformation,
    allowing the transcription machinery to access DNA.', 'Conversely, removal of
    acetyl groups by  HDACs results in a closed conformation, repressing transcription
    and inhibiting gene expression.', 'An increase in HDAC activity and expression
    has been demonstrated in a number of cancer types, and may result in a repression
    of gene transcription that results in the deregulation of differentiation, cell
    cycle, and apoptotic mechanisms.', 'In addition, important tumor suppressor genes,
    including p21, are observed to be a target for HDAC-mediated transcriptional silencing.',
  'HDAC inhibition has also been reported to disrupt the cell cycle in the G2 phase,
    allowing cells to prematurely enter the M phase, as well as to directly interfere
    with the mitotic spindle checkpoint.', 'HDAC inhibition was first reported by
    Myzak et al., who observed that sulforaphane increased TOPflash reporter activity
    without altering protein levels of -catenin or HDAC1, indicating that the activity
    of HDAC itself was altered.', 'Previous results had shown that TOPflash reporter
    activity may be used as an indirect measure of HDAC activity, with an increase
    in reporter activity corresponding to a decrease in HDAC activity in cells.',
  'In cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts from human embryonic kidney 293  cells treated
    with sulforaphane, HDAC activity was attenuated compared with untreated cells,
    global histone acetylation was increased, and activation of TOPflash was observed
    after its association with acetylated histones H3 and H4.', 'In addition, results
    from this study displayed the importance of sulforaphane metabolites  to produce
    a concentration-dependent inhibition of HDAC activity.', 'It is proposed that
    SFN-Cys is the ideal dietary HDAC inhibitor, due to its formation during sulforaphane
    metabolism, and its regeneration from SFN-NAC.', Sulforaphane treatment also markedly
    increased p21Cip1/Waf1 protein expression due to an increase in acetylated histone
    H4 bound to the promoter region of p21., Similar results were observed in three
    prostate epithelial cell lines  with HDAC inhibition significant at a concentration
    of 15 M sulforaphane., 'Interestingly, 15 M sulforaphane also increased acetylated
    histone H4 association with the pro-apoptotic bax promoter and regulated bax mRNA
    expression, indicating that sulforaphane may directly mediate bax induction through
    chromatin remodeling.', 'After a single oral gavage dose of sulforaphane in Apcmin
    mice, significant inhibition of HDAC activity in the mouse colonic mucosa was
    observed in vivo.', HDAC activity was decreased by 50% with SFN-NAC and by 65%
    with sulforaphane in comparison to untreated mice., 'Both sulforaphane and its
    metabolite produced an increase in acetylated histone H3 and histone H4 in the
    colon, with a two-fold increase at both the 6 and 24 h time points before returning
    to baseline levels.', 'In Apcmin mice, sulforaphane suppressed tumor multiplicity,
    with the average tumor yield lowered by 50% in all regions of the intestine.',
  'Similar to the results from the in vitro studies, sulforaphane induced global histone
    acetylation, with a marked increase in acetylated histone H2 associated with the
    promoter regions of both the p21 and bax genes.', 'Moreover, in human subjects,
    HDAC acitivity was significantly inhibited in the peripheral blood mononuclear
    cells of all three subjects, with detection at 3 h post consumption of 68g broccoli
    sprouts.', 'In two of the subjects, HDAC inhibition was observed at the 6 h time
    point, with levels returning to baseline by 2448 h post consumption.', 'In the
    third subject, HDAC activity at baseline was lower than expected, and, therefore,
    the highest HDAC activity was observed at the 48 h time point.', 'In continuation,
    healthy subjects consumed either the 68 g of broccoli sprouts or six supplements  to
    assess isothiocyanate metabolite levels and HDAC activity.', 'In addition to confirming
    that active myrosine is required for sulforaphane metabolism, inhibition of HDAC
    activity was measured and statistically significant at 12 and 48 h post consumption
    of either the sprouts or the supplementation, when compared with baseline HDAC
    activity.', 'Further human studies are required in order to determine the significance
    of HDAC inhibition in disease, and the ability to provide therapeutic benefit
    via decreased HDAC activity.', 'Studies involved in the evaluation of sulforaphane
    as an HDAC inhibitor, and those aimed at providing insights into the mechanisms
    associated with sulforaphane-regulated inhibition of HDAC activity, have focused
    on the roles of HDAC3 and HDAC6 as important targets.', 'After the incubation
    of HCT116 human colon cancer cells with 15 M sulforaphane, a significant reduction
    in HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3, and HDAC8 was observed compared with vehicle-treated cells
    at 36 h post administration.', 'Among the class I HDACs, HDAC3 protein expression
    was the most susceptible to sulforaphane-induced loss, with cells treated with
    35 M reporting a reduction of HDAC3 expression by more than 95%.', HDAC4 and HDAC6
    were also shown to be reduced after 24 h. Overexpression of either HDAC3 or HDAC6
    was shown to inhibit sulforaphane-induced histone H4-K12 acetylation., 'The silencing
    mediator for retinoid and thyroid hormone receptors  was phosphorylated in the
    nucleus within 6 h of sulforaphane treatment, and was, subsequently, implicated
    in HDAC3 turnover mechanisms.', 'Sulforaphane-induced association of HDAC3/SMRT
    complexes coincided with increased binding of HDAC3 to 143-3 and peptidyl-prolyl
    cis/trans isomerise 1, ultimately directing HDAC3 for degradation.', 'Further
    investigations led to the finding that sulforaphane metabolites may interact with
    the allosteric site between HDAC3 and SMRT, providing new insights into the dissociation
    of HDAC3/SMRT complex in colon cancer cells.', 'Sulforaphane and its metabolites
    were also shown to alter the acetylation status of key DNA repair protein CtIP,
    with a significant increase at 6 h post treatment.', 'The induction of double-strand
    breaks  increased after sulforaphane treatment of cancer cells, but failed to
    effect noncancer controls.', 'Collectively, this evidence suggests that sulforaphane
    may also compromise DNA repair mechanisms in cancer cells with selectivity.',
  'In prostate cancer cells, sulforaphane treatment increased acetylation of two HDAC6
    target proteins: heat shock protein 90  and -tubulin.', 'Despite unchanged HDAC6
    protein levels at early time points, HSP90 became hyperacetylated and dissociation
    of the androgen receptor  from HSP90 was observed.', 'At later time points, AR
    protein levels declined after sulforaphane treatment, indicating the ability of
    sulforaphane to destabilize AR.', 'Importantly, incubation of recombinant HDAC6
    with sulforaphane inhibited HDAC6 deacetylase activity, with sulforaphane leading
    to reduced HDAC6 protein levels at the 16 h time point in prostate cancer cells.',
  Clarke et al., 'demonstrated the ability of sulforaphane to preferentially induce
    apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in the benign prostatic hyperplasia  cell line
    and the LNCap and PC3 prostate cancer cell lines, as well as the induction of
    phase II enzymes.', 'At 24 h post incubation, HDAC inhibition was observed in
    all cells lines, with LNCap cells with a significant inhibition compared with
    healthy controls.', 'By the 48 h time point, sulforaphane induced sustained HDAC
    inhibition in all cancer cell lines.', 'Specifically, HDAC2 and HDAC3 protein
    levels were decreased in BPH-1 cells and HDAC3 in both LNCap and PC3 cell lines
    at 48 h post treatment.', HDAC4 protein expression was decreased in all cell lines
    at one or both time points., 'HDAC6 showed the most significant and consistent
    decrease in protein levels in all prostate cancer cell lines at both 24 and 48
    h time points, with this decrease not observed in healthy prostate cells.', 'Interestingly,
    overexpression of HDAC6 protected PC3 cells from the sulforaphane-induced decrease
    in cell viability, indicating the likely importance of HDAC6 in sulforaphane-mediated
    chemoprevention in prostate cancer.', 'The modulation of patterns in DNA methylation
    are observed during cancer development and progression, and is characterized by
    global- and site-specific DNA hypomethylation as well as gene-specific promoter
    hypermethylation.', 'While DNA hypomethylation may contribute to genome instability
    and increased expression of oncogenes, DNA hypermethylation may lead to the inhibition
    of tumor suppressor genes, transcription factors, and genes involved in cell cycle
    regulation and apoptosis.', 'DNA methylation patterns are mediated by DNA methyltransferases,
    and an overexpression of DNMTs is observed in a number of cancers, including leukemic,
    gastric, lung, and prostate camcer.', Meeran et al., 'first observed the significant
    inhibition of DNMT1 and DNMT3a expression by sulforaphane in a dose-dependent
    manner in human breast cancer cells, and to a lesser extent in normal MCF10A cells.',
  'Specifically, 10 M sulforaphane in 6 days inhibited DNMT1 and DNMT3a expression
    by 48% and 78%, respectively.', 'Ultimately, this study aimed at assessing the
    telomerase activity and human telomerase reverse transcriptase  in human breast
    cancer, and the effect of sulforaphane on hTERT expression.', 'Sulforaphane treatment
    led to the significant downregulation of hTERT in breast cancer cells, with a
    negligible inhibitory activity in the normal control, indicating specificity.',
  Investigation into the molecular mechanisms of sulforaphane-induced inhibition of
    hTERT expression found significant demethylation of CpGs in the CTCF binding region
    on the hTERT regulatory region in both breast cancer cell lines after treatment
    with sulforaphane., 'It is known that the transcription repressor CTCF binds to
    exon 1 of the hTERT gene and, in turn, reduces the expression of hTERT.', Treatment
    with sulforaphane was shown to increase CTCF binding to the hTERT exon 1 binding
    site to subsequently inhibit hTERT expression., It is suggested that the downregulation
    of hTERT expression facilitated the induction of cellular apoptosis in the cancer
    cell lines., Similar results in prostate cancer cell lines established the ability
    of sulforaphane to significantly decrease DNMT1 and DNMT3a mRNA expression., Decreased
    global methylation in LNCap cells after treatment with sulforaphane for 24 h was
    also observed., 'In prostate cancer, cyclin D2 silencing has been observed to
    be associated with cancer progression, with restoration of cyclin D2 inducing
    cell death in prostate LNCap cancer cells.', Investigation of the promoter methylation
    status of cyclin D2 in prostate cancer cells reported a significant decrease in
    methylated CpG sites in the region after sulforaphane incubation., 'In particular,
    sulforaphane significantly decreased methylation at the binding site of the c-Myc
    transcription factor.', 'Due to the demethylation of the cyclin D2 promoter, sulforaphane
    increased cyclin D2 mRNA expression in a dose-dependent manner.', 'Conversely,
    treatment of colon cancer cells with sulforaphane in varying concentrations failed
    to impact abnormal methylation patterns in critical genes involved in colon carcinogenesis
    in vitro.', 'However, Barrera et al.', 'suggest that their finding may be due
    to heterogeneity in cancer, with some cell lines and/or tissue affected by sulforaphane-induced
    gene-specific methylation, while others are more resistant.', 'Recently, assessment
    on the DNA methylation profile in normal prostate epithelial cells, androgen-dependent  and
    androgen-independent  prostate cancer cells was shown to be altered depending
    on the cell line.', 'Untreated LNCap and PC3 cells had significantly higher baseline
    expression of DNMT1, DNMT3a, and DNMT3b compared with untreated PrEC cells.',
  'While sulforaphane treatment of PrEC and LNCap cells decreased DNMT1 and DNMT3b
    gene expression, the expression of all three DNMTs was downregulated in the PC3
    cell line.', 'Hierarchical clustering analysis showed that 64% of the 54,876 probes
    and 49% of the 78,272 probes in LNCap cells displayed hypermethylation relative
    to PrEC cells.', 'This represented 10,315 and 8013 genes differentially methylated
    in LNCap and PC3 genes, respectively, compared with the normal control.', 'Functional
    annotation analyses indicated that genes with altered methylation profiles in
    the prostate cancer cell lines were genes involved in cancer progression, and
    associated with cell migration, cell adhesion, cellcell signalling, as well as
    transcription regulation.', 'After sulforaphane treatment, 2472, 3508  and 6778  differentially
    methylated genes were detected.', 'Interestingly, sulforaphane altered methylation
    in distinct sets of genes in each of the cell lines.', 'In PrEC cells, genes involved
    in transcription, apoptosis, and chromatin organization/modification were altered
    with sulforaphane treatment.', 'Functional annotation analysis in LNCap cells
    found that two general categories of genes were affected:  genes associated with
    cell movement, including cell migration, adhesion, and localization, and  genes
    associated with the immune response, including inflammation, leukocyte activation,
    and immune regulation.', 'Sulforaphane treatment in PC3 cells altered genes shared
    both PrEC and LNCap cell lines, including those involved in transcription, apoptosis,
    cell migration, and immune response.', Perhaps the most interesting finding was
    the reversal of the methylation profiles of 1509  genes  after sulforaphane treatment
    in LNCap cells., 'Many of these genes are known to be dysregulated or are highly
    involved in cancer progression, including transforming growth factor-1 receptor
    type I, C-C chemokine receptor type 4, C-X-C chemokine receptor receptor type
    4, and cysteine-rich angiogenic inducer 61.', 'Overall, this study demonstrated
    the capacity of sulforaphane to modulate DNA methylation and regulate gene expression
    in order to act as a chemopreventive compound in prostate cancer in vitro.', Further
    studies are required in order to enhance understanding of the epigenetic modulatory
    mechanisms of sulforaphane., 'As previously described, sulforaphane was first
    identified as a potent inducer of phase II detoxifying enzymes via the disruption
    of Nrf2-Keap1 interactions, and an increased translocation and therefore activation
    of Nrf2.', Zhang et al., aimed at investigating the potential of sulforaphane
    to reactive the expression of Nrf2 through epigenetic regulation., 'In prostate
    cancer TRAMP C1cells, Nrf2 transcription was significantly inhibited when the
    first five CpG regions of the Nrf2 gene promoter were hypermethylated.', 'Treatment
    with sulforaphane  reduced the level of methylation to 56.0% and 38.7%, respectively.',
  'Demethylation of the promoter region was shown to result in the transcription activation
    of Nrf2, with increased mRNA and protein expression measured.', This study also
    demonstrated decreased protein levels of DNMT1 and DNMT3a after sulforaphane treatment
    in a dose-dependent manner in TRAMP C1 cells., 'In addition, sulforaphane decreased
    protein levels of HDAC1, HDAC4, HDAC5, and HDAC7, indicating HDAC inhibitory activity.',
  The global level of acetylated histone 3 was also highly induced by sulforaphane
    treatment., 'Comparable to this study, sulforaphane significantly inhibited 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate
    -induced mouse skin epidermal  transformation via its ability to enhance nuclear
    translocation of Nrf2 and increase expression of Nrf2-target antioxidant genes,
    including HO-1, NQO1, and UGT1A1.', Bisulfite sequencing determined that 15 CpG
    regions in the Nrf2 gene promoter were hypermethylated in the untreated cells.,
  The ratio of methylated CpG regions was decreased to 68.7% by 2.5 M sulforaphane.,
  'Furthermore, sulforaphane decreased the protein expression of DNMT1, DNMT3a, and
    DNMT3b in a concentration-dependent manner in TPA-induced JB6 cells post treatment.',
  'In addition, treatment with either 2.5 or 5.0 M sulforaphane significantly inhibited
    relative HDAC activity by 50%, with reduced protein expression levels of HDAC1,
    HDAC2, HDAC3, and HDAC4 observed.', These findings suggest that sulforaphane has
    the ability to restore expression and activation of Nrf2 via a number of epigenetic
    regulatory mechanisms., 'MicroRNAs  are short noncoding RNAs, 18 to 25 nucleotides
    in length, that regulate gene expression post-translation through binding to 3
    untranslated regions of target mRNA.', 'Bioinformatic studies predict that miRNAs
    regulate almost 30% of all mammalian genes, and are dysregulated in the majority
    of human cancers.', 'The assessment of sulforaphane in the regulation of miRNA
    expression is limited in the literature, and further investigation is required
    in order to complete understanding.', The treatment of nontransformed human colonic
    epithelial cells with sulforaphane resulted in significant changes in miRNA expression
    profiles  as analyzed by quantitative real-time reverse-transcription polymerase
    chain reaction., Global downregulation of miRNA expression was demonstrated from
    colorectal tumor tissue., 'Focusing on miRNA expression changes in both cell lines,
    the upregulation of miR-23b and miR-27b was significant due to a previous observation
    of decreased levels in clinical tumor tissue.', MiR-23b has been shown to be critical
    in tumor suppression and regulation of EMT., 'Conversely, downregulation of miR-155  by
    sulforaphane was also identified as important.', 'In addition, the expression
    of miR-200c, which has been identified in the regulation of EMT in human bladder
    cancer, was significantly induced by sulforaphane in the human bladder T24 cancer
    cell line.', 'In basal-like ductal carcinoma in situ  lesions, 68 miRNAs were
    significantly dysregulated in tissue compared with controls via microarray analysis.',
  The downregulation of miRNA-140 expression was indicated to be the most reproducible
    miRNA signature in the lesions that was implicated in tumor suppression., 'In
    a subsequent analysis of 22 DCIS samples, Li et al.', observed the miR-140 loss
    in all tumors irrespective of histological grade and breast malignancy type.,
  Also demonstrated was the finding that the 72 miRNAs were found to be differentially
    expressed between normal mammary epithelial stem cells  and stem-like cells isolated
    from the DCIS lesions., 'Interestingly, miR-140 was one of the most significantly
    downregulated in cancer stem-like cells, with a 13.55-fold difference compared
    with normal stem cells.', 'Treatment of DCIS tissue with sulforaphane was shown
    to activate miR-140 expression and downregulation of SOX9 and ALDH1, resulting
    in a decrease in stem-like cell frequency in vitro and a significant inhibition
    of tumor growth in vivo.', Further characterization of exosomal trafficking of
    a stem-like population in basal-like DCIS lesions resulted in the finding that
    the exosomal miRNA expression pattern in DCIS stem-like cells possessed an inverse
    trend in comparison to nontumorigenic MCF10A stem cells., 'For example, miR-21
    and miR-29 were secreted in high levels in the DCIS stem-like cells, with normal
    stem cells secreting much lower levels.', 'In the context of sulforaphane, treatment
    resulted in increased exosomal miR-140  and decreased miR-21 and miR-29.', 'Collectively,
    this evidence suggests that sulforaphane may have the capacity to inhibit DCIS
    stem cell signaling in neighboring cells through epigenetic mechanisms by increasing
    exosomal miR-140 secretion in the tumor microenvironment.', 'Navigate ArticleTop

    Multiple commercially developed sulforaphane supplements are currently available;
    however, the difficulty in manufacturing a potent and bioavailable formula has
    proved to be difficult, with an intrinsic instability of the sulforaphane molecule
    preventing this method of delivery.', Manufacturing a sulforaphane-yielding supplement
    requires the ability to retain both the glucoraphanin precursor and the myrosinase
    enzyme for subsequent metabolism and transformation to the bioactive isothiocyanate.,
  'A number of phase I and II clinical trials on sulforaphane, however, are in progress
    or have been completed to assess its safety, tolerance, pharmacokinetics, and
    therapeutic benefit in healthy human subjects and in the context of cancer.',

    Residents of Qidong are at high risk for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma,
    which was in part due to long-term exposure to aflatoxin-contaminated food, and
    the airborne carcinogen, phenanthrene.', 'An inverse association between the level
    of sulforaphane metabolites and carcinogen-related markers, including aflatoxin-DNA
    adducts, was demonstrated.', 'It was also reported that sulforaphane increased
    the excretion of airborne pollutants in individuals consuming the broccoli extract
    beverage, with the administration of a broccoli sprout-infused beverage containing
    400 M glucoraphanin nightly for 2 weeks causing no adverse effects and being well
    tolerated in 200 subjects.', 'Although promising, results displayed significant
    variability in the bioavailability of the active compound.', 'Consistent with
    this finding, Fahey et al.', 'found that administration of a sulforaphane-rich
    broccoli sprout extract to two distinct populations  resulted in varied bioavailability
    between individuals in both populations, ranging from 1% to 40%.', 'In a recent
    intervention study, the total sulforaphane metabolite concentration in plasma
    was the highest  at 3 h in human subjects who consumed fresh broccoli sprouts  in
    the first phase of study, compared with that measured after administration of
    a commercially available broccoli supplementation in the second phase.', 'A randomized,
    placebo-controlled double-blind Phase I clinical trial involving healthy volunteers
    and the administration of glucoraphanin or isothiocyanate as the sulforaphane
    source examined parameters of safety, tolerance, and pharmacokinetics.', No significant
    toxicity was observed with the dose concentrations administered in this study.,
  'Although the plasma concentration of total bioactive sulforaphane may be measured
    in order to provide a crude estimate of bioavailability and therapeutically significant
    dosage, accumulation within the tumor site itself may not be significant.', 'For
    example, a pilot study detected an accumulation of sulforaphane in human breast
    tissue after consumption of broccoli extract containing 200 M sulforaphane 1 h
    before elective reduction mammoplasty.', 'Mean epithelial-/stromal-enriched breast
    tissue dithiocarbamate concentration was 1.451.12 pmol/mg in the right breast,
    and 2.001.95 pmol/mg in the left breast.', 'In comparison, the plasma concentration
    post sulforaphane administration was measured at 0.920.72 M.

    Although the chemopreventive properties of sulforaphane have been widely investigated
    and extensively reported, the difficulty in the administration of a dose that
    may confer therapeutic significance limits its potential for clinical use.', 'In
    addition, the estimated consumption required to observe benefits in limiting cancer
    development and progression has been shown to be unrealistic in the average diet.',
  Limitations in the bioavailability of the compound after administration and/or consumption
    may also become problematic in human trials as genetic variance and patient compliance
    become factors., The use of a combination of anticancer compounds that affect
    different functional pathways may possess the capacity to generate additive or
    synergistic activity., 'In theory, this is an attractive approach for the prevention
    and/or treatment of complex disease, including cancer.', 'Current chemotherapeutic
    agents fail to adequately treat malignancy with multivariable dose-restricting
    factors, including systemic toxicity and multi-drug resistance limiting therapeutic
    benefits and long-term remission rates.', 'Interestingly, a number of studies
    have aimed at using sulforaphane in combination with a range of cytotoxic compounds
    in order to enhance drug efficacy, and, therefore, limit adverse effects observed
    in chronic administration and high concentration regimens.', 'To demonstrate,
    sulforaphane was shown to enhance the antitumor activity of oxaliplatin and synergistically
    activate apoptotic pathways in the colorectal cancer cell line, Caco-2.', Fimognari
    et al., investigated the effects of sulforaphane in combination with doxorubicin
    on cell viability and apoptosis in fibroblasts characterized by a different p53
    status., This mutation has been implicated in reduced efficacy and drug resistance
    in osteosarcomas and breast cancer treated with doxorubicin., 'Sulforaphane was
    shown to restore chemosensitivity and to induce apoptosis in doxorubicin-resistant
    p53 mutated and p53 knockout cells, irrespective of p53 status.', The induction
    of apoptosis was caspase-3 dependent and caspase-8 independent., 'Interestingly,
    proliferation of salivary gland adenoid cystic carcinoma high metastatic cell
    line  and low metastasis cell line  observed to be relatively resistant to a classic
    chemotherapeutic agent, 5-fluroracil, was inhibited with a synergistic combination
    using sulforaphane.', 'A decreased expression of NFB p65 protein was also demonstrated,
    with results more significant in ACC-M cells.', 'Although effective in acute promyelocyctic
    leukemia, arsenic trioxide fails to adequately treat non-APL blood cancers.',
  'Significantly, sulforaphane enhanced arsenic trioxide-mediated cytotoxicity and
    apoptosis in a panel of leukemic cell lines, with a dramatic increase in the number
    of ROS compared with treatment with either agent alone.', 'Continuing with this
    combination, Doudican et al.', 'co-treatment of multiple myeloma cells resulted
    in elevated expression of the molecular chaperone HSP90, along with increased
    protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase, and important makers of
    unfolded protein response  activation.', Sulforaphane in combination with arsenic
    trioxide effectively disrupted protein homeostasis through the production of ROS
    and induction of apoptotic processes., Synergistic effects in pancreatic cancer
    stem cells were demonstrated when sulforaphane was administered in combination
    with sorafenib., It was proposed that these effects were mediated by the reduction
    of sorafenib-induced NFB binding by sulforaphane., 'Although treatment with sulforaphane
    at varying concentrations resulted in a dose- and time-dependent decrease in cell
    viability of MCF-7 cells, a combination of sulforaphane and gemcitabine demonstrated
    the capacity of sulforaphane to enhance the growth inhibitory effects of gemcitabine
    at sub-lethal doses.', 'Administration of sub-lethal doses of sulforaphane  when
    used in various combinations with lower doses of gemcitabine  resulted in a decrease
    in cell viability that was more pronounced than either of the compounds alone
    and the combination index  was found to be &lt;1, indicting synergistic effects.',
  'In addition, interactions with other known chemopreventive and antioxidant dietary
    components have also observed synergistic activity after administration in a number
    of models and systems.', 'For example, the administration of sulforaphane and
    resveratrol  inhibited cell proliferation and migration, reduced cell viability,
    induced lactate dehydrogenase release, decreased pro-survival Akt phosphorylation,
    and increased caspase-3 activation in human U251 glioma cells.', 'A combination
    of sulforaphane and the flavonoid apigenin was shown to modulate gene expression
    of phase II detoxifying enzymes  in the human epithelial colorectal adenocarcinoma
    cell line, Caco-2.', This combination resulted in a synergistic induction of UGT1A1
    mRNA by approximately 12-fold., 'The indole, 3,3-diindolylmethane  also derived
    from cruciferous vegetables has been shown to have cytostatic mechanisms in human
    colon cancer cell lines.', 'In this same study, sulforaphane  in combination with
    DIM  resulted in strong G2/M cell cycle arrest, which was not observed with either
    compound alone.', Nair et al., also demonstrated a synergistic effect after administration
    of sulforaphane and the catechin epigallocatechin-3-gallate in HT-29 AP-1 human
    colon carcinoma cells., 'This combination dramatically enhanced transcriptional
    activation of the Ap-1 reporter, with analysis finding that the CI was &lt;1\.',
  'Cell viability assays showed that low-dose combinations decreased cell viability
    to 70%, and to 40% with high-dose combinations at 48 h post treatment.', Pretreatment
    with 100 ng/ml of TSA  potentiated  the synergism observed with the low-dose combination
    on the AP-1 reporter transcriptional activation., 'Pancreatic stem cells and their
    self-renewal capacity may also be modulated with a combination of sulforaphane
    and the dietary polyphenol, quercetin.', 'The synergistic effect of this combination
    has also been observed in melanoma B16F10 cells, with the suppression of proliferation

    The importance of a diet that is rich in cruciferous vegetable and the role of
    isothiocyanates, including sulforaphane, in promoting good health has been extensively
    studied and consistently demonstrated in a wide variety of models and systems.',
  'Understanding the phylogeny of glucosinolate-producing plants, in conjunction with
    the molecular genetics of the Brassicaceae family may enable us to further enhance
    bioavailability of the bioactive compounds through the development of cultivars
    with significantly higher amounts of glucoraphanin.', 'Bioavailability and therefore
    pharmacokinetics of sulforaphane are also dependent on a range of other factors,
    including active myrosinase content, preparation, and human genetic patterns.',
  'Although commercially available as a supplement, sulforaphane has yet to be FDA
    approved for the treatment of human disease, including cancer.', 'However, the
    chemopreventive properties of sulforaphane, and its capacity to be selectively
    toxic to malignant cells and impart these effects through a number of mechanisms,
    provide rationale to completely elucidate and evaluate its potential as an anti-cancer
    compound alone, and in combination with clinically relevant therapeutic and management
    strategies.', 'Navigate ArticleTop of pageAuthor informationABSTRACTIntroductionPhylogeny,
