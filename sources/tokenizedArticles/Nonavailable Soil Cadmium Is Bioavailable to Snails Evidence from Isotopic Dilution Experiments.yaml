text: ['Isotopic dilution techniques were initially used to evaluate the bioavailability
    of trace metals contained in soils to plants, i.e., the phytoavailability.', 'Here,
    we use for the first time an isotopic technique to evaluate the zooavailability
    of cadmium, i.e., the bioavailability to an animal organism.', 'A terrestrial
    invertebrate, the snail Helix aspersa, was exposed for 14 days to a polluted soil
    that was spiked with 109Cd.', 'Isotopic composition of snail tissues was then
    determined, allowing the computing of the L value, which can be considered as
    a biological estimate of the bioavailable Cd pool in the soil.', It showed that
    the bioavailable pool of Cd to H. aspersa represented 58% of the total soil Cd.,
  'The E value, a chemical estimate of the soil Cd labile pool, was calculated with
    short-term isotopic exchange kinetics experiments and a time-dependent model describing
    the isotopic exchange over time.', The E value indicated that the labile soil
    Cd pool represented 49.6% of the total soil Cd., 'The L value was significantly
    higher than the E value, showing that snails accessed the nonlabile soil Cd pool,
    generally considered as nonbioavailable.', The nonlabile pool contributed for
    16% to the total Cd accumulated by snails., These results showed that the uptake
    of Cd in the nonlabile pool by soil organisms could be important and should be
    considered in risk assessment procedures for metal polluted soils.]
