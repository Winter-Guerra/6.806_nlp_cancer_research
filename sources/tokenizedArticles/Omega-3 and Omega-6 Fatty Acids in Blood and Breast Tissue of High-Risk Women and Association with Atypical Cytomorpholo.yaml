text: ['The ratio of omega-3 to omega-6 fatty acids, especially the long-chain eicosapentaenoic
    acid  + docosahexaenoic acid  to arachidonic acid  ratio, is inversely associated
    with breast cancer risk.', 'We measured the association between cytologic atypia,
    a biomarker for short-term risk of breast cancer development, and omega-3 and
    omega-6 fatty acid intake and levels in blood and breast tissue.', 'Blood and
    benign breast tissue, sampled by random periareolar fine-needle aspiration, was
    obtained from 70 women at elevated risk for breast cancer.', Self-reported dietary
    intake was assessed by the NCIs Food Frequency Questionnaire., 'The fatty acid
    composition of five lipid compartments, red blood cell, plasma and breast phospholipids,
    and plasma and breast triaclyglycerides, was analyzed by gas chromatography as
    weight percent.', 'Median daily intakes of EPA+DHA and total omega-3 fatty acids
    were 80 mg and 1.1 g, respectively.', 'The median total omega-3:6 intake ratio
    was 1:10.', 'Compared with women without atypia, those with cytologic atypia had
    lower total omega-3 fatty acids in red blood cell and plasma phospholipids and
    lower omega-3:6 ratios in plasma TAGs and breast TAGs.', 'The EPA+DHA:AA ratio
    in plasma TAGs was also lower among women with atypia.', This is the first report
    of associations between tissue levels of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids and a
    reversible tissue biomarker of breast cancer risk., RPFNA cytomorphology could
    serve as a surrogate endpoint for breast cancer prevention trials of omega-3 fatty
    acid supplementation., Cancer Prev Res; 8; 35964., 2015 AACR.]
