text: ['Isothiocyanates, occurring in many dietary cruciferous vegetables, show interesting
    chemopreventive activities against several chronic-degenerative diseases, including
    cancer, cardiovascular diseases, neurodegeneration, diabetes.', The electrophilic
    carbon residue in the isothiocyanate moiety reacts with biological nucleophiles
    and modification of proteins is recognized as a key mechanism underlying the biological
    activity of isothiocyanates., 'The nuclear factor-erythroid-2-related factor 2
    system, which orchestrates the expression of a wide array of antioxidant genes,
    plays a role in the protective effect of isothiocyanates against almost all the
    pathological conditions reported above.', Recent emerging findings suggest a further
    common mechanism., 'Chronic inflammation plays a central role in many human diseases
    and isothiocyanates inhibit the activity of many inflammation components, suppress
    cyclooxygenase 2, and irreversibly inactivate the macrophage migration inhibitory
    factor.', 'Due to their electrophilic reactivity, some isothiocyanates are able
    to form adducts with DNA and induce gene mutations and chromosomal aberrations.',
  DNA damage has been demonstrated to be involved in the pathogenesis of various chronic-degenerative
    diseases of epidemiological relevance., 'Thus, the genotoxicity of the isothiocyanates
    should be carefully considered.', 'In addition, the dose-response relationship
    for genotoxic compounds does not suggest evidence of a threshold.', 'Thus, chemicals
    that are genotoxic pose a greater potential risk to humans than non-genotoxic
    compounds.', Dietary consumption levels of isothiocyanates appear to be several
    orders of magnitude lower than the doses used in the genotoxicity studies and
    thus it is highly unlikely that such toxicities would occur in humans., 'However,
    the beneficial properties of isothiocyanates stimulated an increase of dietary
    supplements and functional foods with highly enriched isothiocyanate concentrations
    on the market.', Whether such concentrations may exert a potential health risk
    cannot be excluded with certainty and an accurate evaluation of the toxicological
    profile of isothiocyanates should be prompted before any major increase in their
    consumption be recommended or their clinical use suggested.]
