text: ['In this study, the possible molecular mechanisms involved in the estrogen-like
    activities of ethanol extracts from two common Chinese legumes, i.e.', Adzuki
    bean  and Lima bean  were investigated., 'Reverse transcription-polymerase chain
    reaction  measurement and western blot analysis were conducted to detect the functional
    mRNA and protein expressions, while immunofluorescence was used to determine the
    estrogen receptor  intracellular distribution in the MCF-7/BOS cell line.', 'The
    results indicated that  both mRNA and protein levels of progesterone receptor  in
    the cell line increased after 48 h treatment with the extracts compared with those
    in the control;  Adzuki and Lima bean extracts might alter the ER intracellular
    distributions in two different manners: for the Adzuki bean, the ER appeared in
    both cytoplasm and nucleus, while for the Lima bean, it exhibited the same pattern
    as that of estradiol in which the ER almost disappeared in the nucleus and mainly
    occurred in the cytoplasm.', 'Above all, the results showed a novel pattern of
    ER intracellular distribution in the MCF-7/BOS cell line upon exposure to Adzuki
    bean extract, suggesting that different pathways were involved in the estrogen-like
    activities of the ethanol extracts of Adzuki bean and Lima bean.', 'Copyright  2007
