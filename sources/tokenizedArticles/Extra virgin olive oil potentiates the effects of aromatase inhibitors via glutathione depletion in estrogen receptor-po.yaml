text: ['There have been numerous evidences supporting the relationship between olive
    oil and cancer, with most of the attention being directed toward its fat and phenolic
    content.', 'The aims of this study were to investigate whether EVOO and OA could
    enhance the effects of aromatase inhibitors  in ER-positive MCF-7 cells, as well
    as to investigate its influence on cytochrome c release and GSH levels.', 'It
    was observed that upon combination treatment, anti-proliferation effects and apoptosis
    induction were augmented.', Apoptosis was triggered via the intrinsic pathway
    in accordance with cytochrome c release into the cytosol based on IF-IC and ELISA
    observations., 'Intracellular GSH levels were also reduced upon EVOO/OA treatment
    in combination with aromatase inhibitors, and were found to be inversely correlated
    to cytosolic cytochrome c levels.', 'Additionally, the estrogenic suppressive
    effects of letrozole and anastrozole were amplified when used in combination with
    EVOO/OA.', 'Therefore, the employment of aromatase inhibitors in combination with
    EVOO/OA could orchestrate a reduction in intracellular estrone biosynthesis which
    feeds ER-positive cells, while simultaneously depleting GSH levels and increasing
    ROS generation, thus releasing cytochrome c and subsequent induction of apoptosis
    in MCF-7 cells.']
