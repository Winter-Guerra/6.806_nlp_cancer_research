text: ['To explore the antitumor effect of caffeic acid 3,4-dihydroxy-phenethyl ester  on
    the breast cancer cell lines and illuminate the related mechanism.', 'After treatment
    with different concentrations of CADPE for 24, 48, and 72 h, cell proliferation
    ability of the breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435 was analyzed
    by the MTT.', Changes of the cell cycles were evaluated by PI staining., Cell
    apoptosis was examined by flow cytometry after Annexin V/7AAD double staining.,
  Nuclear morphologic changes were observed under the inverted fluorescence microscope
    after staining with Hoechst 33342., Mitochondrial membrane potential and reactive
    oxygen species  level were estimated by JC-1 and DCFH-DA staining., 'In addition,
    the expression level of mitochondrial signaling pathway proteins Bcl-2, Bax, and
    caspase-3 were evaluated by Western blot.', 'CADPE has the distinct cytotoxic
    effect to the breast cancer cells, and the effect is dose dependent.', It did
    not change the cell cycles but induced the cell apoptosis of the breast cancer
    cells., 'At the same time, after CADPE treatment, the expression levels of caspase-3
    and Bax in the breast cancer cells were upregulated and Bcl-2 expression was declined.',
  'The ROS level in the breast cancer cells was enhanced, and mitochondrial membrane
    potential of the cells was downregulated.', CADPE has the antitumor functions.,
  'It can induce the cell apoptosis through downregulating Bcl-2 expression, enhancing
    Bax and caspase-3 expression levels, upregulating ROS level and reducing the mitochondrial
    membrane potential of the breast cancer cells to trigger the mitochondrial signal
    pathway.', Breast cancer is the most prevalent tumor and a major cause of morbidity
    and mortality among women., 'Each year, more than one million new cases appeared
    all over the world and brought serious harm to women health.', 'Surgery together
    with chemotherapy is the main method for breast cancer treatment; the chemotherapy
    cannot only relieve or cure part of the tumor but it can also bring serious side
    effects to the patients, so finding a new therapeutic schedule with high efficiency
    and low toxicity has always been the target of the medical research.', 'Caffeic
    acid 3,4-dihydroxy-phenethyl ester, a compound originally isolated from medicinal
    plants Sarcandra glabra and Teucrium pilosum, has attracted more interests due
    to its proven pharmacologic safety and its many biologic activities, such as suppression
    of hepatocellular carcinoma growth  and gastric carcinoma cell migration.', 'In
    the present study, we investigated the effects of CADPE on the breast cancer cell
    lines MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435 and explored the related mechanism.', 'Culture
    medium RPMI-1640, trypsin-EDTA, penicillin/streptomycin, and fetal calf serum
    were bought from Gibco Company.', MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435 cell lines were obtained
    from American Type of Culture Collection., 'Hoechst 33342, Ribonuclease A solution,
    and proteinase K were the products of Sigma-Aldrich.', 'Primary and secondary
    antibodies of caspase-3, -actin, Bax, and Bcl-2 for Western blot analysis were
    purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Other chemicals and reagents used
    in this study were of analytical grade.', The MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435 cells
    were cultured in RPMI-1640 culture medium supplemented with 10 % FBS and antibiotics
    under a fully humidified atmosphere and 37 C and 5 % CO2 condition., Cells in
    the log phase were treated with various concentrations of CADPE synthesized in
    our lab as described before., Cell proliferation was tested by Cell titer 96  AQueous
    nonradioactive cell proliferation assay., 'Briefly, log phase MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435
    cells were treated with 0.25 % trypsin to make single-cell suspension with RPMI-1640;
    the cell concentration was adjusted to 5  107/L, and 100 l of this single-cell
    suspension was planted into a 96-well plate and incubated at 37 C with 5 % CO2
    for 24 h. The medium was replaced with 100 l RPMI-1640 medium containing different
    concentrations of CADPE  and 10 % fetal calf serum, and cells were cultured at
    37 C and 5 % CO2 condition for 0, 24, 48, and 72 h. Then, 20 l Cell titer 96  AQueous
    nonradioactive cell proliferation assay reagent  was added to each well for 4
    h of additional incubation.', The absorption values at 490 nm were determined
    with an automatic enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate reader., 'After treated
    with 0, 20, and 40 mol/l CADPE for 48 h, MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435 cells were
    collected and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline.', 'DNA of the washed
    cells  was subjected to incubation with 600 l PI solution  for 20 min, the cell
    cycles were determined with flow cytometry and analyzed utilizing CellQuest software.',
  'After treatment with series concentrations of CADPE for 24 h, breast cancer cells
    MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435 were fixed with 4 % formaldehyde solution and washed
    with PBS for three times.', 'After stained with 10 mol/l of Hoechst 33342 for
    10 min, the cells were washed twice with PBS again, and the changes of nucleic
    morphologies were observed under the fluorescence microscopy.', Apoptosis rates
    of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435 cells were measured after Annexin V-PE/7-AAD  double
    staining according to the instruction of the kit., 'Briefly, MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435
    cells were cultured with RPMI-1640 culture medium containing 10 % fetal calf serum
    and different concentrations of CADPE in 6-well plates, collected and washed twice
    with PBS solution, and then rewashed with binding buffer, 0.14 M NaCl, and 2.5
    mM CaCl2).', 'Subsequently, cells were stained with Annexin V-PE/7-AAD at room
    temperature and dark condition for 15 min.', The cells were washed with cold PBS
    for three times and detected with flow cytometry., 'The cells marked as Annexin
    V and 7-AAD were considered viable cells, Annexin V+ and 7-AAD were counted as
    early apoptotic cells, Annexin V+ and 7-AAD+ cells were late apoptotic cells,
    and Annexin V and 7-AAD+ were necrotic cells.', 'The mitochondrial membrane potential
    was determined using the mitochondria-specific lipophilic cationic fluorescence
    dye 5,5,6,6-tetrachloro-1,1,3,3-tetraethylbenzimi-dazolylcarbocyanine iodide  detection
    kit according to the manufacturers instructions.', 'In brief, MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435
    cells were treated with 10 or 20 mol/l CADPE, co-cultured with 100 l JC-1 for
    30 min at 37 C and dark condition, washed twice with PBS followed by measurement
    of the fluorescence intensity by fluorescent microscopy.', JC-1 can enter mitochondria
    selectively., 'In healthy cells with high mitochondrial membrane potential, the
    dye reagent aggregates and emits red fluorescence.', 'When the mitochondrial membrane
    potential collapses, JC-1 cannot accumulate in the mitochondria, the cells will
    show only green fluorescence.', 'The breast cancer MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435 cells
    at logarithmic phase were planted into 24-well flat-bottom plates, 6  104 cell/well,
    in RPMI-1640 culture medium containing 10 % fetal calf serum and CADPE  under
    37 C and 5 % CO2 condition for 48 h. Then collected the cells and examined their
    ROS level with ROS fluorescence probes 2,7-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate.',
  'Briefly, discarded the supernatant of the cells, added 200 l DCFH-DA  diluted with
    RPMI-1640 culture medium, and cultured the cells under 37 C and 5 % CO2 and no-light
    condition for 1 h. Washed the cells with RPMI-1640 culture medium for three times,

    C for 30 min.', 'After 13,000g centrifugation at 4 C for 15 min, protein concentrations
    were determined by the bicinchoninic acid assay  using bovine serum albumin as
    standard.', Forty micrograms of total cellular proteins and 10 l of 2 sample buffer
    were mixed together and subjected to heat treatment at 100 C for 5 min to denature
    the proteins., 'The proteins were separated with sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide
    gel electrophoresis, transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride  membranes  using
    an electrotransfer system.', 'The nitrocellulose membrane was blocked in the blocking
    buffer  at room temperature for 2 h, and incubated with the primary antibodies
    against Bcl, Bax, -actin, and caspase-3 proteins at room temperature for 2 h  containing
    Tween-20.', 'The membranes were washed three times with TBS-T liquid, before incubated
    with antimouse IgG-conjugated HRP  at room temperature for at least 1 h. Protein

    To confirm that the grow inhibition induced by CADPE was mediated by cell apoptosis
    mechanisms, nucleic Hoechst33342 staining which allowed observing morphologic
    characteristics of cell apoptosis was carried out after MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435
    cells were treated with 0, 10, and 20 mol/l of CADPE for 24 h. Then the cells
    were observed with phase contrast fluorescence microscope.', The CADPE-treated
    groups showed a notable decrease in the number of cells compared with the control
    group., 'The nucleus of the 0 mol/l CADPE-treated cells showed an oval shape with
    intact and homogenous fluorescence after Hoechst33342 staining, while fluorescent

    To determine the mechanism of caspase-3, Bax, and Bcl-2 in modulating breast cancer
    cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435 apoptosis induced by CADPE, we analyzed the
    expression levels of caspase-3, Bax, and Bcl-2 proteins with Western blot after
    treatment with different concentrations of CADPE.', 'The results showed that 10,
    20, 40 mol/l CADPE treatment promoted the expression of caspase-3 and Bax and
    downregulated Bcl-2 expressions in a dose-dependent manner.', '-actin was the
    internal control, suggesting that the protein loading amount was the same.', 'Collectively,
    these results suggest that CADPE induced apoptosis by activating expression of
    caspase-3, Bax, and inhibiting Bcl-2 in both the breast cancer cell lines.', 'Effects
    of CADPE on the protein expression levels of caspase-3, Bcl-2, and Bax in the
    MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435 cells using Western blot analysis.', The cells were
    treated with various concentrations  of CADPE., 'The equal amounts of protein
    from cell lysate were subjected on 12 % sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide

    with anti-Bcl, anti-Bak, anti-caspase-3, and anti--actin antibodies.', The immunoreactive
    signals were visualized by enhanced chemilluminescence detection kit., -actin
    was used as an internal control., 'To determine whether the growth inhibitory
    effect of CADPE on the breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435 is associated
    with cell apoptosis, Annexin V-PE/7-AAD double staining, and flow cytometric analyses
    were performed.', As shown in Fig., '6, the number of apoptotic cells increased
    in a dose-dependent manner after incubation with 0, 10, and 20 mol/l CADPE.',
  'The upper left quadrant of the cytograms shows the dead cells, which is positive
    to 7-AAD and negative to Annexin V. The lower left quadrant of the cytograms shows
    the viable cells.', 'In the upper right quadrant, it shows the late apoptotic
    and early necrotic cell  population.', The lower right quadrant shows apoptotic
    cells., 'Compared with the control group, the apoptosis-inducing effects of CADPE
    on MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435 cells were 22.4 %  and 11.8 %  in 10 mol/l CADPE-treated
    groups, 77.3 %  and 66.7 %  in 20 mol/l CADPE-treated groups, the apoptosis rates
    in all these groups were significantly higher than the 0-mol/l CADPE-treated groups  and
    had a tendency of dosage dependent.', These results demonstrated that the inhibition
    of cell proliferation activity by CADPE was due to the apoptosis induction., 'Cell

    Depletion of mitochondrial membrane potential is one of the early events that
    occur following induction of cellular apoptosis.', 'To determine the changes of
    mitochondrial membrane potential in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435 cells after CADPE
    treatment, JC-1 staining was carried out.', 'The fluorescence microscope observation
    confirmed that 10 and 20 mol/l CADEP-treated cells showed progressive loss of
    red JC-aggregate fluorescence and appearance of green monomer fluorescence in
    the cytoplasm, and this decrease occurred in a dose-dependent manner.', These
    data suggested that the involvement of the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis in the
    mechanism of cell death induced by the CADPE., The results of cell mitochondrial
    membrane potential dissipation induced by CADPE., 'Breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231
    and MDA-MB-435 were exposed to 0, 10, or 20 mol/l CADPE and stained by JC-1 reagent.',

    intact mitochondrial membrane potential., 'Green fluorescence represents the monomeric
    form of JC-1 indicating a dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential


    Breast cancer is the most common cancer, and accounting for nearly 25 % of all
    cancers in women.', 'In 2010, nearly 1.6 million women all over the world were
    diagnosed with breast cancer and almost occupy 14 % population of the cancer deaths
    in women.', 'In recent years, the incidence of breast cancer kept increasing globally
    and showed poor prognosis even if the diagnosis and treatments of cancer had been
    improved greatly, and approximately 7080 % of the breast cancer patients who were
    diagnosed in the early stage recurrence without any symptoms after surgery.',
  'Therefore, not only local treatments like surgery but also chemotherapy is very
    important for the breast cancer treatment.', 'So, finding useful medicines and
    exploring their related mechanism is the key to achieve the real treatment for
    breast cancer.', 'Apoptosis, the planned cell death, is characterized as cell
    shrinkage, nuclear collapse, membrane blebbing, and DNA fragmentation.', Apoptosis
    plays critical roles in a lot of physiologic processes in cell development., Failure
    in apoptosis will facilitate tumor formation and development., The evidences proved
    gradually that many cancer chemotherapeutic medicines killed the cancer cells
    through inducing cell apoptosis., One of the important apoptotic pathways is mitochondrial-mediated
    signal pathway., 'In this pathway, mitochondria play the key role in mediating
    cell apoptosis and upregulating of the membrane potential is the main mechanism
    for inducing cell apoptosis.', Mitochondrial damage is associated with the high
    level of caspases and ROS production., Decline of mitochondrial membrane potential
    leads to the caspase-3 activation which is an important effector in apoptosis
    inducing., 'Caspase-3 can lead to dismantling of the cell such as disruption of
    organelle function, cytoskeletal and nuclear disassembly through regulating a
    series of substrates, result in the typical hallmark features of apoptosis.',
  'Many pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins, which belong to the Bcl-2 family, were found
    to be upregulated  and downregulated  in a lot of cell apoptosis.', Many data
    also confirmed that some chemical therapy medicines could result in the DNA damage
    through upregulating the apoptosis-promoting proteins of Bcl-2 family., 'To explore
    the apoptosis-inducing function of CADPE on breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231
    and MDA-MB-435 and clarify if this apoptosis-inducing function of CADPE is through
    mitochondrial signal pathway, a series of studies were performed.', Cell proliferation
    analysis results revealed that CADPE induced a decrease of cell proliferation
    activity of these breast cancer cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner., Flow
    cytometry examination data confirmed the decline of the proliferation capability
    induced by CADPE was not related with cell cycle arrest of these cells., 'Western
    blot analysis showed that the expression levels of caspase-3, Bcl-2, and Bax were
    influenced by CADPE treatment, CADPE upregulated the expression of caspase-3 obviously,
    at the same time, it broke the balance of Bax and Bcl-2, leading to the Bax in
    a dominant position, and the ratio of Bcl-2 and Bax declined remarkably.', The
    results of ROS examination also confirmed that CADPE can enhance the ROS level
    of these cells., 'The cell cycle analysis, Hoechst staining, flow cytometry analysis
    and JC-1 staining of the breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435, which
    were treated with CADPE, also indicated that CADPE can downregulate the Mitochondrial
    Membrane Potential and induce cell apoptosis of these cells, and the apoptosis
    characterized as nucleic acid fragmentation, chromatin condensation and morphological
    changes with the number of cells reductions.', 'In conclusion, CADPE represented
    a superior dose- and time-dependent cytotoxicity in high metastatic breast cancer
    cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435.', 'It can inhibit the growth of these cells
    in dose and time-dependent manner through inducing nucleus fragmentation, upregulating
    the ROS level and the expression of apoptosis precursor protein Bax, downregulating
    anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 expression, increasing the ratio of Bax and Bcl-2,
    decreasing mitochondrial membrane potential, triggering the caspase-3 cascade
    and inducing cell apoptosis of these breast cancer cells.', 'Thus, results in
    the study suggest that CADPE could be utilized as a cancer treatment against breast
    cancer.', This experiment provided a certain reference value for application of
    CADPE in the treatment of high metastatic breast cancer., This study was partly
    supported by Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau Foundation.]
