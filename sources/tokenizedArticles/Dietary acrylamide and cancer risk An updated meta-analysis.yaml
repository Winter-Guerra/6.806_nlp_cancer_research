text: [The debate on the potential carcinogenic effect of dietary acrylamide is open.,
  'In consideration of the recent findings from large prospective investigations,
    we conducted an updated meta-analysis on acrylamide intake and the risk of cancer
    at several sites.', 'Up to July 2014, we identified 32 publications.', 'We performed
    meta-analyses to calculate the summary relative risk  of each cancer site for
    the highest versus lowest level of intake and for an increment of 10 g/day of
    dietary acrylamide, through fixed-effects or random-effects models, depending
    on the heterogeneity test.', Fourteen cancer sites could be examined., No meaningful
    associations were found for most cancers considered., 'The summary RRs for high
    versus low acrylamide intake were 0.87 for oral and pharyngeal, 1.14 for esophageal,
    1.03 for stomach, 0.94 for colorectal, 0.93 for pancreatic, 1.10 for laryngeal,
    0.88 for lung, 0.96 for breast, 1.06 for endometrial, 1.12 for ovarian, 1.00 for
    prostate, 0.93 for bladder and 1.13 for lymphoid malignancies.', The RR was of
    borderline significance only for kidney cancer., 'All the corresponding continuous
    estimates ranged between 0.95 and 1.03, and none of them was significant.', 'Among
    never-smokers, borderline associations with dietary acrylamide emerged for endometrial  and
    ovarian  cancers.', This systematic review and meta-analysis of epidemiological
    studies indicates that dietary acrylamide is not related to the risk of most common
    cancers., 'A modest association for kidney cancer, and for endometrial and ovarian
    cancers in never smokers only, cannot be excluded.', 'Epidemiological evidence
    on the relation between dietary acrylamide and the risk of several cancers has
    continued to accumulate during the last few years, after the publication of our
    first systematic review and meta-analysis on acrylamide and human cancer.', 'Recently,
    several data have been released from large cohort studies, including--among others--the
    European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition  and the Nurses Health
    Study.', 'In particular, the EPIC study, including over 500,000 participants,
    reported results for esophageal, pancreatic and endometrial cancer.', 'An increased
    risk of esophageal cancer  emerged in subjects with intermediate levels as compared
    to low acrylamide intake, but no significant association was found for a high
    intake.', 'No association emerged for pancreatic cancer, based on 865 incident
    cases, the HRs being 0.77  for high versus low intake and 0.95  for an increase
    in acrylamide intake of 10 g/day.', 'The analysis of endometrial cancer, including
    1,382 cases--627 of which were type-I--found no overall association with acrylamide,
    but a positive one for type-I endometrial cancer in the subgroup of women who
    never smoked and never used oral contraceptives.', 'The NHS considered the relation
    between dietary acrylamide and breast, endometrial and ovarian cancer.', 'The
    study included 6,301 cases of breast, 484 of endometrial, and 416 of ovarian cancer.',
  'While no association emerged with breast cancer, the risk was increased for endometrial  and,
    to a lower extent, ovarian cancer.', 'A subsequent nested case-control analysis
    including data from the NHS I and II considered the relation between acrylamide
    exposure, as measured by hemoglobin adducts, and ovarian cancer risk, providing
    no evidence of association.', Our earlier extensive systematic review and meta-analysis
    on acrylamide and cancer included data of both dietary and occupational exposures
    published until June 2009., That meta-analysis found no increase in risk of most
    types of cancer in relation to acrylamide exposure., 'Since for several cancer
    sites the number of cases available from epidemiological studies on dietary acrylamide
    is now more than doubled, and given the continuing debate on the issue, we updated
    the quantitative meta-analysis on dietary acrylamide intake and cancer risk.',
  The methods used are similar to those described in our earlier meta-analysis., 'In
    the current investigation, however, the interest was focused on the estimate of
    total dietary acrylamide only, because:  there are no new relevant data from occupational
    studies, and  studies considering specific foods/food groups  are no longer relevant,
    given the accumulating number of investigations providing estimates of total dietary
    acrylamide.', 'In July 2014, we performed a systematic literature search in the
    Medline database, using PubMed, without restrictions according to language, using
    the following search string:  AND  AND.', 'Since the literature search of our
    earlier meta-analysis was conducted in June 2009, we limited our search to the
    period 2009-2014\.', 'A similar search was conducted in EMBASE, using the same
    keywords and over the same search period.', Potentially relevant articles were
    retrieved and assessed., Those that were not in the scope for this review were
    excluded., Abstract and unpublished studies were also excluded., 'None of the
    selected, relevant articles was published in a language other than English.',
  'No studies were excluded a priori for weakness of design or data quality, and we
    did not assign quality scores to the studies.', A total of 105 publications were
    identified in the PubMed search and 203 in the EMBASE search., 'A first selection,
    mainly based on the title and abstract of the publications, was performed to exclude
    those studies that were clearly nonrelevant, and 59 publications were retained
    for further consideration.', These were abstracted and reviewed in detail., 'Among
    them, 46 did not report original epidemiological results on dietary acrylamide
    and cancer and were no longer considered, whereas the remaining 13 publications
    were retained for the review.', 'These were added to the previously selected 19
    publications on dietary intake of acrylamide, for a total of 32 publications.',
  'We reviewed all the studies selected and abstracted the following information in
    a standard format: study design; country; cancer sites; number of cases and person-years,
    overall and according to each level of acrylamide intake; sex; data categorization
    ; mean  acrylamide intake in each category among controls; relative risk estimates  and
    the corresponding 95% CI; and additional results from subgroup analyses.', A few
    publications reported duplicate results from the same populations., 'A population-based
    case-control study conducted in Sweden provided early results on dietary acrylamide
    intake and risk of cancers of the colorectum, bladder and kidney.', 'In a subsequent
    letter, the authors provided updated results based on a more comprehensive estimate
    of acrylamide intake.', The latter RRs were thus used for the main meta-analyses.,
  'Still, data from the first report were used in subgroup analyses on smoking status,
    as the corresponding results were not available in the subsequent letter.', Two
    publications provided results on acrylamide and colorectal cancer using data from
    the Netherlands Cohort Study., We included in the meta-analysis the estimates
    from the first publication that was based on a larger number of cases and a longer
    follow-up period., 'Also, two publications from the NCS were focused on breast
    cancer.', 'We included in the meta-analysis the estimates from the second publication,
    that had an extended follow-up period and a larger number of cases.', Two publications
    reported the RRs and 95% CIs as figures only., 'The exact RR estimates for colorectal,
    bladder cancer, and for renal cell cancer could be retrieved  and were used in
    the meta-analyses, while the RR estimate for kidney cancer and the corresponding
    95% CI were no longer available and were thus derived from Figure 2 of Ref.',
  and from Figure 1 of Ref.., 'When at least two independent risk estimates on dietary
    acrylamide exposure were available for a specific cancer site, we performed a
    meta-analysis and calculated pooled RR estimates, and the corresponding 95% CIs,
    for high versus low level of exposure and for an increment of 10 g/day of dietary
    acrylamide.', 'For the latter, when the RR for an increment of 10 g/day of dietary
    acrylamide was not available from the original analysis, we estimated it using
    a method proposed by Greenland and Longnecker, which relates the natural logarithm
    of the RR to the corresponding mean value of acrylamide intake across exposure
    categories, taking into account that risk estimates for subsequent levels of intake
    are correlated.', 'When data on number of subjects in each level were not available,
    we ignored the correlation between estimates and calculated the dose-risk slopes
    using variance-weighted least squares regression.', 'To obtain the summary RRs
    for high versus low exposure and, separately, for an increment of 10 g/day of
    dietary acrylamide intake, we pooled the corresponding RR estimates according
    to a fixed-effects model using the inverse variance method, when the test for
    heterogeneity between estimates was not significant, or to a random-effects model,
    which considers both within- and between-study variations, using the DerSimonian
    and Laird method, when the test for heterogeneity between estimates was significant.',
  Heterogeneity between estimates was assessed using the 2 test., 'For cancer sites
    with at least four published studies, we also computed summary estimates in subgroups
    of study design  and smoking habit, and according to menopausal status and hormone
    receptor status for breast cancer.', 'Given the small number of studies providing
    relevant results across separate strata, we did not perform meta-analyses on subsets
    of risk estimates defined according to sex, body mass index or other potential
    effect modifiers.', All the statistical analyses were performed using the STATA
    package., Table 1 shows the main characteristics and results of the 32 publications
    that provided data on dietary acrylamide and cancer risk., The publications and
    their results are ordered by cancer site  and publication year., 'Several publications
    reported risk estimates for more than one cancer site and/or subtype, or separately
    by sex.', 'Therefore, a total number of 64 estimates for high versus low acrylamide
    intake and 71 estimates for the continuous measure of intake are given in Table
    1.', 'Separate RR estimates for various cancer subtypes  were pooled, in order
    to obtain a single RR to be included in the meta-analysis of the corresponding
    cancer site.', No meta-analysis was conducted for brain and thyroid cancer., 'Therefore,
    a total number of 55 estimates were included in the meta-analyses of dietary acrylamide
    and risk of cancer at various sites.', 'Table 2 gives, for each cancer site examined,
    the number of available estimates  and the corresponding total number of cases,
    together with the summary RR and 95% CI for both a categorical  and a continuous  measure
    of acrylamide intake.', 'All the RR estimates for high versus low level of intake
    were close to unity, six were below, seven above unity and one equal to 1.00.',
  'Except for kidney cancer, that showed a borderline significant increased RR  for
    high versus low acrylamide intake using a fixed-effects model, there was no other
    significant association.', 'When we repeated the meta-analysis of kidney cancer
    using a random-effects model, the RR was 1.18.', 'With further reference to kidney
    cancer, the continuous RR was 1.02, obtained using a random-effects model.', 'Using
    a fixed-effects model, the corresponding RR was 1.02.', Breast cancer had the
    largest number of estimates  and cases., 'The corresponding RRs were 0.96  for
    high versus low intake and 1.00  for an increase in intake of 10 g/day, with no
    evidence of heterogeneity between estimates.', Six estimates were available for
    prostate  and colorectal  cancers., 'As concerns prostate cancer, both RRs were
    equal to 1.00, while for colorectal cancer the RRs were 0.94  for high versus
    low intake and 1.00  for an increase of 10 g/day.', 'For other cancer sites, the
    number of cases on which the meta-analyses were based was lower.', 'The summary
    RRs for high versus low acrylamide intake were 0.87 for oral and pharyngeal, 1.14
    for esophageal, 1.03 for stomach, 0.93 for pancreatic, 1.10 for laryngeal, 0.88
    for lung, 1.06 for endometrial, 1.12 for ovarian, 0.93 for bladder  cancer and
    1.13 for lymphoid malignancies.', 'All the corresponding continuous estimates
    ranged between 0.95 and 1.03, and none of them was significant.', 'Within most
    cancer sites, estimates were fairly homogeneous.', 'Significant heterogeneity
    between estimates was reported only for cancers of the oral cavity and pharynx,
    lung, and ovary, besides kidney.', 'Table 3 gives the pooled RRs and 95% CIs of
    selected cancer sites  for high versus low dietary acrylamide intake, according
    to subgroups of study design, smoking status  and, for breast cancer, menopausal
    status and hormone receptor status.', 'The pooled RRs for high versus low acrylamide
    intake from cohort studies only were 1.01  for esophageal, 0.96  for colorectal,
    0.87  for pancreatic, 0.96  for breast, 1.06  for endometrial, 1.20  for ovarian,
    1.01  for prostate and 1.48  for kidney cancer.', The risk of endometrial  and
    ovarian cancer  for high acrylamide intake was of borderline significance in the
    subgroup of never smoking women., 'For kidney cancer, the RRs for high versus
    low acrylamide intake were not materially different in never/former smokers  and
    in current smokers.', No difference in risk of breast cancer with high acrylamide
    intake emerged according to menopausal status nor for different hormone receptor
    cancer types., 'This updated quantitative review of the available evidence on
    dietary acrylamide and cancer risk confirms previous indications of a lack of
    association with most cancer sites, as well as of a potential small increase in
    the risk of kidney cancer, and of endometrial and ovarian cancer in never smoking
    women, at high levels of acrylamide intake.', 'The findings reported by different
    studies were generally not heterogeneous, and results were confirmed when only
    cohort investigation were retained in the analyses.', 'The total number of cancer
    cases included in this updated meta-analysis was approximately doubled by including
    the new data released over the last 5 years, mainly from large prospective cohort
    studies.', 'Thus, we were able to examine a higher number of cancer sites, as
    well as to achieve an increased statistical power - with, therefore, narrower
    CIs for several estimates.', 'This notwithstanding, for some cancer sites the
    number of studies is still limited.', 'As concerns kidney cancer, we reported
    a 20% increase in risk in subjects with high as compared to low dietary acrylamide
    intake, based on data from three case-control and two cohort studies.', 'Considering
    only the latter study design, the increase was somewhat higher, that is, about
    50%.', 'On the other hand, there was no significant association when the analyses
    were conducted using a continuous measure of exposure.', 'The latter analysis
    was however affected by relevant heterogeneity between study estimates, ranging
    from 0.91 in a Swedish case-control investigation to 1.10 in the NCS.', 'This
    may be at least in part explained by different results according to study design
    with, again, cohort studies reporting moderately higher risk estimates.', 'Smoking
    is a major risk factor for kidney cancer and a major source of acrylamide exposure,
    too.', 'Thus, smoking might have a confounding or modifying effect on the relation
    between dietary acrylamide and kidney cancer.', 'All the five studies included
    in the meta-analysis of kidney cancer, however, controlled their risk estimates
    for some measure of tobacco smoking, and when we performed subgroup meta-analyses
    according to smoking status, we found similar RRs among never/former and current
    smokers.', Limited indications for a potential role of acrylamide exposure on
    cancer of the kidney were also provided from two occupational cohort studies.,
  'Given the modest, borderline significant, association and the still limited amount
    of epidemiological data on kidney cancer, the issue remains therefore open to
    discussion.', 'The main pathway to carcinogenesis of acrylamide is through its
    oxidization to glycidamide, a chemically reactive genotoxic metabolite.', 'Besides
    damaging and mutagenic effects on DNA, the existence of other modes of action
    of acrylamide is supported by the observation of a tissue-specific cancerogenicity
    in both mice and rats.', Acrylamide may also exert a carcinogenic role on selected
    body sites by affecting hormonal balances., 'This, together with the findings
    of animal studies that reported an increased occurrence of mammary gland tumors
    in rats which were given acrylamide through drinking water, explains the wide
    interest in investigating the relation with breast, but also endometrial and ovarian,
    cancer in epidemiological studies.', 'Our meta-analysis, however, did not report
    an association with breast cancer risk.', 'In particular, the summary RRs of dietary
    acrylamide and breast cancer were below unity for high versus low intake, as well
    as in subgroups of prospective studies, of both never and ever smokers, and of
    both estrogen receptor positive /progesterone receptor positive  and ERPR breast
    cancers.', 'Two other publications  considered acrylamide exposure in relation
    to breast cancer, but were not included in the present meta-analysis, because:  the
    first investigation considered biomarkers of exposure, that is, acrylamide-hemoglobin  and
    glycidamide-Hb adducts, but not dietary intake.', 'This study found a positive
    association between acrylamide-Hb level and ER+  but not ER- breast cancer, the
    overall RR being 1.9.', 'Results for ER+ breast cancer were lower in nonsmokers  than
    in smokers, and a significant increase in breast cancer risk emerged only after
    careful adjustment for smoking habits, including amount, duration and past smoking.',
  'Smokers had over threefold higher levels of acrylamide adducts than nonsmokers,
    in both cases and controls.', 'The lack of matching of cases and controls on smoking
    status--which had an important role in that study--makes it, therefore, difficult
    to interpret the results;  the second investigation analyzed the role of prediagnostic
    biomarkers of acrylamide exposure on survival after a diagnosis of breast cancer.',
  'Breast cancer specific mortality increased with increasing adduct levels, particularly
    in nonsmoking women with ER+ cancer.', 'Thus, the results on biomarkers of acrylamide
    exposure of the Danish, Diet, Cancer and Health study indicated significant increases
    of both ER+ breast cancer risk and mortality, that should be further investigated.',
  'This meta-analysis of data on dietary acrylamide, on the other hand, did not find
    associations with ER+PR+ nor with ER+PR breast cancer risk.', The role of acrylamide
    on endometrial and ovarian cancers has been the object of a recent debate., 'In
    this updated review, we were able to include additional data from the NHS and
    EPIC  studies.', 'Still, summary results were close to those of our previous report
    confirming, overall, an absence of association, but a moderate increase in risk
    in the subgroup of never smoking women.', 'For ovarian cancer, some caution is
    needed in the interpretation of results, given the unexplained heterogeneity between
    estimates.', 'Another study examined data of the NHS and NHS II on ovarian cancer
    risk according to Hb adduct levels, and was thus not included in the meta-analysis
    on dietary acrylamide.', This reported no association in the complete dataset  nor
    in the subgroup of nonsmoking women., 'Overall, epidemiological studies published
    to date do not support an association between dietary acrylamide intake and major
    female hormone-related cancers.', 'Associations in specific subgroups, particularly
    among never smokers for endometrial and ovarian cancers, cannot be excluded, and
    need further investigation.', 'With reference to other cancer sites, a considerable
    amount of data is now available on the role of dietary acrylamide on colorectal
    and prostate cancers.', Overall results do not indicate any excess risk for these
    cancer sites., 'For colorectum, however, a recent study reported for the first
    time differential results for acrylamide and colorectal cancer with specific somatic
    mutations, with a more than twofold increased risk of cancers with an activating
    Kirsten-ras  mutation in men and a halved risk of cancers with a truncating adenomatous
    polyposis coli  mutation in women with high versus low acrylamide intake.', 'To
    date, specific information on the molecular characteristics of colorectal tumors
    in relation to acrylamide intake is limited to this investigation.', 'For prostate
    cancer, one of the studies included in the meta-analysis provided further results
    for acrylamide-Hb adduct levels, besides dietary intake, reporting no association.',
  'As concerns pancreatic cancer, a possible link with acrylamide exposure has been
    suggested by occupational cohort studies.', 'On the other hand, none of the four
    epidemiological studies on dietary intake of acrylamide reported any association,
    and the summary RR of dietary studies was below unity.', 'While no relation emerged
    in the meta-analysis of lymphoid malignancies as a whole, a positive association
    was found, in the only study that considered different types of lymphoid malignancies
    separately, with multiple myeloma and with follicular lymphoma in men.', 'For
    other cancer sites as well, associations were null or weak, although in some cases
    based on limited data and/or on heterogeneous risk estimates.', Epidemiological
    studies on dietary acrylamide have been criticized for their alleged inadequacy
    to address its relation with cancer risk., 'Besides general limitations of cohort
    and case-control studies, we acknowledge several critical aspects related to this
    specific topic, including the difficulties in estimating dietary acrylamide intake
    through food frequency questionnaires and databases of acrylamide content in foods,
    the lack of repeated exposure estimations over an adequately long time-period,
    and the lack of statistical power to detect small increases in risk.', 'However,
    epidemiological studies also have several strengths.', 'In particular, they allow
    to directly address the relation between acrylamide exposure and cancer risk in
    humans, avoiding the uncertainties deriving from the use of animal data and mathematical
    models, and to assess the public health relevance of such a relation.', 'During
    the last decades, epidemiological studies identified several dietary and nutritional
    factors associated with the risk of various cancers, particularly those of the
    digestive tract.', This weighs in favor of the capability of epidemiological studies
    to assess the association with dietary acrylamide., 'Further, the meta-analytic
    approach - in the absence of relevant heterogeneity, as was the case for most
    of the analyses presented here - increases to a great extent the statistical power
    of the investigation, by joining together the results of several studies.']
