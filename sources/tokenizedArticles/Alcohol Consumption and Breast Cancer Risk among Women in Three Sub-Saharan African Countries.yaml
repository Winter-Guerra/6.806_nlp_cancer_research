text: [Alcohol drinking is linked to the development of breast cancer., 'However,
    there is little knowledge about the impact of alcohol consumption on breast cancer
    risk among African women.', 'We conducted a case-control study among 2,138 women
    with invasive breast cancer and 2,589 controls in Nigeria, Cameroon, and Uganda
    from 1998 to 2013.', 'A structured questionnaire was used to collect information
    on alcohol consumption, defined as consuming alcoholic beverages at least once
    a week for six months or more.', Logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted
    odds ratio  and 95% confidence interval., 'Among healthy controls, the overall
    alcohol consumption prevalence was 10.4%, and the prevalence in Nigeria, Cameroon,
    and Uganda were 5.0%, 34.6%, and 50.0%, respectively.', Cases were more likely
    to have consumed alcohol., Both past  and current drinking  were associated with
    breast cancer risk., 'A dose-response relationship was observed for duration of
    alcohol drinking, with 10-year increase of drinking associated with a 54% increased

    leading cause of cancer morbidity and mortality for women world-wide,,,,,.', 'In
    recent decades, breast cancer incidence has seen a steady increase in many developing
    countries while it reached a plateau in developed nations,,.', Alcohol consumption
    has been considered a plausible risk factor for breast cancer., 'This relationship
    has been confirmed in some studies,,,,,,, but not in others,,,.', 'However, the
    majority of these studies were conducted among women in high income countries,,,,,
    with few in developing countries,,.', 'To our knowledge, there is no large study
    on alcohol intake and breast cancer conducted in Africa.', 'Studies of the relationship
    between alcohol consumption and breast cancer risk among African Americans have
    found inconclusive results,,,,.', 'The extent of alcohol drinkings effect on breast
    cancer risk may vary across races, possibly due to different drinking habits,
    metabolism and genetic factors.', 'In general, alcohol drinking is less common
    among African women than their counterparts in North America and Europe, but the
    prevalence rates vary by country in Africa: ever drinking prevalence ranges from
    ;1% to over 40% and current drinking prevalence ranges from none to nearly 30%,,.',
  'The general trend among African women is towards greater prevalence of alcohol
    consumption,.', Most studies of alcohol and breast cancer have assessed alcohol
    use in terms of ever-drinking versus nondrinking or the average daily dose., Other
    patterns of alcohol use such as duration of alcohol consumption or age when first
    started drinking and their relationship to breast cancer risk are less well understood.,
  'We conducted a case-control study of alcohol consumption patterns and breast cancer
    risk among women in three sub-Saharan African countries: Nigeria, Cameroon, and
    Uganda.', The African Breast Cancer Study was originally started in Nigeria in
    1998 and was expanded to Uganda and Cameroon in 2011 using the same questionnaire
    and protocol., 'The study protocol was reviewed by the institutional review boards
    of the three sites and the University of Chicago, University of Ibadan/University
    College Hospital Ethics Committee, Cameroon National Ethics Committee, and Makerere
    University College of Health Sciences Ethics Committee ).', 'The study setting
    and design at the Nigeria site are described in detail elsewhere,,.', 'Briefly,
    cases were identified through University College Hospital, University of Ibadan,
    in Ibadan, Nigeria.', 'Serving a population of more than 3 million people, UCH
    is a referral center for other hospitals and thus treat the majority of breast
    cancer cases in the region.', 'All consecutive females who were 18 years or older,
    black of African descent, capable of providing informed consent, and had a histologic
    or clinical diagnosis of invasive breast cancer were recruited through the surgical
    oncology and radiotherapy units of the UCH.', 'Controls were females aged 18 years
    or older, absent of breast cancer, and able to give informed consent.', 'During
    the period of case enrollment, several communities were randomly selected by ballot
    from the list of all the communities in catchment area of UCH and considered to
    be stable, socio-economically and ethnically diverse, and represent UCH patients.',
  Field interviewers randomly approached households in these communities and invited
    eligible women to visit community centers for the study., 'We also enrolled clinical
    controls through general outpatient and ophthalmology clinics in the UCH, matched
    for age and ethnicity.', Women were enrolled during their waiting in clinics and
    they are unselected for their medical conditions., 'As the characteristics of
    hospital-based and community controls were similar, they were pooled in the further
    analysis.', 'In Uganda, cases were identified at the breast and endocrine unit
    in department of surgery of the Mulago Hospital, Makerere University in Kampala.',
  Mulago Hospital is a national referral hospital in Uganda and serves the 1.3 million
    residents in Kampala., 'Controls were randomly recruited from the general outpatient
    clinics and surgical ward admissions at Mulago Hospital, matched to cases for
    age and ethnicity.', 'In Cameroon, breast cancer cases were enrolled at the department
    of medical oncology of Yaound General Hospital, Yaound University I in Yaound.',
  Yaound General Hospital serves a population of 2.5 million people., 'Controls were
    randomly recruited from the clinics of general medicine and obstetrics and gynecology
    departments at the same hospital, matched to cases for age and ethnicity.', 'At
    the Kampala and Yaound sites, hospital controls were unselected for their medical
    conditions.', All study participants provided written informed consent prior to
    their interview., 'During the recruitment, both patients and controls were enthusiastic
    to participate in the study, with a response rate of &gt;90%.', 'Trained interviewers
    at the three sites performed structured questionnaire interviews, measured height
    and weight, and obtained blood samples.', 'The questionnaire included questions
    about demographics, family history of breast cancer and history of benign breast
    disease, lifestyle factors, menstrual and reproductive history, and alcohol consumption
    patterns.', 'Before 2006, alcohol consumption was asked in Nigeria in terms of
    average volume of alcohol consumed per week.', 'After 2006, the measurement was
    changed to average number of drinks per week.', 'In Uganda and Cameroon, the alcohol
    consumption was asked in terms of average number of drinks per week.', 'To convert
    the amount of alcohol into a common unit, the following conversion criteria were
    used: 350 mL bottle of beer  150 mL glass of wine  50 mL shot of spirits  18 mL
    pure ethanol, which is equivalent to one standard drink.', We then summed the
    amount of pure ethanol the participant consumed irrespective of the type of drink.,
  'We subsequently converted the volume of pure ethanol to gram: 1 mL = 0.8 gram.',
  Each standard drink is hence equivalent to about 14.4 grams of pure ethanol., 'We
    also constructed a new variable called the life-time alcohol consumption, which
    was defined as gram-years: the average daily amount of alcohol in grams was multiplied
    by the subjects duration of alcohol consumption in years.', We defined alcohol
    drinking as having ever consumed alcoholic beverages at least once a week for
    continuous six months or more., 'In addition, we measured other alcohol drinking
    patterns: status of drinking, age at first drink, duration of alcohol drinking,
    and average amount of alcohol consumed daily.', 'Duration of alcohol drinking
    was grouped into four categories: never drank, 19, 1019, and 20 years.', 'Average
    amount of alcohol consumed daily was also grouped into four categories: never
    drank, 0.14.9, 5.09.9, and 10.0 grams.', 'Age at first drink had five categories:
    never drank, 18, 1924, 2529, and 30 years.', 'Life-time alcohol consumption was
    also categorized into five groups: never drank, 0.129.9, 30.079.9, 80.0159.9,
    and 160.0 gram-years.', Demographic factors and potential confounding factors
    for breast cancer were compared between cases and controls using student t-test
    or Wilcoxon rank-sum test for continuous variables and 2 test or Fishers exact
    test for categorical variables., All P-values reported are two-sided., 'We calculated
    the percentages of control women who were currently consuming alcohol by the age
    groups of 1834, 3544, 4554, and 55 years.', Multiple logistic regression models
    were used to examine the association between breast cancer and various patterns
    of alcohol consumption while adjusting for study site and other potential confounders
    listed below., 'These confounders were adjusted for in every multivariable logistic
    regression model and were defined as follows: age at diagnosis or interview, ethnicity,
    education, age at menarche, family history of breast cancer, history of benign
    breast disease, hormonal contraceptive use, fertility drugs, height, body mass
    index, menopausal status, age at first live birth, and parity.', Adjusted odds
    ratio  and 95% confidence interval  were computed from the logistic regression
    models., 'Ever drank, status of drinking, and type of alcohol consumed  were included
    in the models solely as categorical variables.', 'Age at first drink, duration
    of alcohol drinking, average amount of alcohol consumed daily, and life-time alcohol
    consumption were analyzed as both categorical variables and continuous variables.',
  'Stratified analyses were also performed to compare the breast cancer risk between
    ever-drinkers vs. never-drinkers across different strata of demographic and reproductive
    variables, such as premenopausal vs. post-menopausal women.', Potential confounding
    variables were adjusted for in these analyses., 'There were missing data for age
    at first drink, duration of alcohol drinking, average volume of drinking, and
    other important covariates.', 'To use all available information and avoid bias
    due to list-wise deletion in the multivariable analysis, we conducted multiple
    imputations via chained equations approach for imputation,.', All covariates and
    outcome variable  were included in the imputation model., We ran 100 imputations
    to improve statistical efficiency of the imputation estimates to be over 99.5%.,
  The logistic regression models described above were fitted using each of the imputed
    data sets., Results across the multiply imputed datasets were combined according
    to Rubins rules., Multiple imputation approach assumes missing at random., Older
    women tended to forget how much alcohol they consumed in the past., 'By including
    age in the multiple imputation models, it is reasonable to believe that the probability
    of missing alcohol data was at random.', 'As a sensitivity analysis, we conducted
    the analysis using data without missing value in any of the covariates in the
    models.', 'All statistical analyses, including the imputation, were conducted
    with STATA 13.0.', 'A total of 2,138 breast cancer cases and 2,589 controls  were
    enrolled in the study between March 1998 and July 2013, including 1,756 cases
    and 2,217 controls in Nigeria, 192 cases and 182 controls in Cameroon, and 190
    cases and 190 controls in Uganda.', Table 1 shows selected demographic and reproductive
    characteristics of study participants., 'Since Nigeria comprises the largest proportion
    of the study population, demographic differences between cases and controls in
    the Nigerian population will influence the difference in the overall population.',
  Cases in Nigeria were 5.1 years older than controls on average; there was no difference
    in age between cases and controls in Cameroon or Uganda., 'Most participants in
    Nigeria were Yoruba, and over half of the participants in Uganda were Baganda
    and in Cameroon were Bantous.', 'In all study participants, about 40% had less
    than a secondary education.', About 75% of women had 3 live births., There were
    no differences between cases and controls in terms of their average age at menarche
    and use of fertility drugs in the crude analysis., 'In the Nigerian population,
    cases were taller than controls, on average.', Cases were more likely to have
    a family history of breast cancer and a history of benign breast disease in Nigeria
    and Cameroon., 'Similarly, controls were more likely to have ever used hormonal
    contraceptives.', 'In the Cameroon population, the proportion of cases who had
    a family history of breast cancer  was considerably larger than the controls.',
  'This difference was less pronounced in Nigeria and Uganda, though the difference
    was still statistically significant in Nigeria.', Table 1., 'Demographics of women
    with invasive breast cancer  and those without  in Nigeria, Cameroon and Uganda,
    19982013.', 'Overall, there were 1,311  missing values across 16 variables in
    Tables 1 and 2.', 'Complete information was available for ethnicity, ever drink
    alcohol, menopausal status, and site of study.', 'About 5% of participants had
    a missing value for age at menarche, and 3% of them had missing values for height
    and weight.', Data were occasionally missing for other variables as well., One
    hundred data sets were generated by multiple imputation such that the efficiency
    of estimating OR was greater than 99.5% for the fraction of missing information
    up to 0.08., Table 2., 'Patterns of alcohol consumption among women in Nigeria,
    Cameroon and Uganda, 19982013


    Among healthy controls, 10.4% were alcohol drinkers, and the percentage of ever
    drinkers in Cameroon, Nigeria, and Uganda were 34.6%, 5.0%, and 50.0%, respectively.',
  Figure 1 shows the percentages of current alcohol drinking among women by age group.,
  Women in Cameroon and Uganda were more likely to be current drinkers than those
    in Nigeria., 'Among women in Cameroon and Nigeria, current drinking was proportionately
    more common in middle-aged women  than younger or older women, while in Uganda,
    young women  had the highest prevalence of current drinking.', Figure 1., Percentage
    of healthy controls who were current drinkers by age group in the three African
    countries., Table 2 presents the alcohol drinking patterns among cases and controls.,
  There was no statistical difference in the mean age at first drink and mean amount
    of alcohol consumed daily in the overall data., 'In terms of duration of alcohol
    consumption, cases were found to drink for 2.8 years longer on average than in
    controls.', 'In the overall population, 86.4% of drinkers consumed 1 drink per
    day, 8.8% of drinkers consumed 12 drinks per day, 2.8% of drinkers consumed 23
    drinks per day, and 2.1% of drinkers consumed more than 3 drinks per day.', 'In
    drinkers, there was no considerable difference in amount of alcohol drinking among
    the three countries.', Table 3 presents the relationship of the alcohol drinking
    patterns to breast cancer risk with calculated odds ratio and 95% CI using imputed
    data., 'Among the whole study sample, cases were more likely than controls to
    have ever consumed alcohol.', Both past drinking  or current drinking  were associated
    with increased breast cancer risk., Breast cancer risk was relatively consistent
    regardless of when the women first started drinking., 'Compared with non-drinkers,
    women who had drunk for &lt;10 years had 41% higher odds of having breast cancer,
    and those who had drunk for 1019 years had 71%  and those for 20 years had 82%  higher
    odds of having breast cancer.', Every 10-year increase in the duration of drinking
    was associated with a 54% increase in breast cancer risk., 'We also found that
    alcohol consumption was associated with breast cancer risk, regardless of alcohol
    amount; breast cancer risk increase was shown even in the category of women who
    consume 0.14.9 g/day.', 'In the variable life-time alcohol consumption, increased
    breast cancer risk was observed for subjects who consume at least 30 gram-years
    or more of alcohol.', 'We also found a statistically significant trend, with each
    100 gram-years contributing a 29% increase in breast cancer risk.', 'The complete
    case analysis, in which subjects with missing values in any of the variables in
    the models were dropped, showed similar study findings.', Table 3., 'Multivariable
    logistic regression analyses of alcohol consumption and breast cancer risk among
    women in Nigeria, Cameroon and Uganda, 19982013, using data after multiple imputation.',
  'Table 4 shows the relationship between ever-drinking and breast cancer risk by
    strata of age at interview or diagnosis, ethnicity, height and other demographic
    and reproductive variables.', 'When the interactions between the stratified variables
    and ever drinking alcohol were tested, parity and BMI were found to have a statistically
    significant interaction with alcohol drinking.', 'In parous women, the association
    between drinking alcohol and breast cancer was weaker  than that in nulliparous
    women.', 'There was no statistically significant association between alcohol consumption
    and breast cancer among women with BMI 25 kg/m2, while among women with BMI &gt;25
    kg/m2, ever-drinkers had nearly twice the odds for breast cancer than never-drinkers.',
  'For other stratification variables, drinkers had similarly elevated risks for breast
    cancer compared to non-drinkers across the strata of these variables.', Table
    4., 'Stratified analyses of alcohol consumption and breast cancer risk among women
    in Nigeria, Cameroon, and Uganda using data after multiple imputation, 19982013.',
  'Our case-control study of 4,727 African women from Nigeria, Cameroon, and Uganda
    showed a positive relationship between breast cancer and alcohol drinking.', 'Overall,
    the odds of having breast cancer were 62% higher among women who ever consumed
    alcohol than among no-drinkers.', This finding was in general agreement with literature.,
  'The current evidence on the relationship between alcohol consumption and female
    breast cancer risk is largely based on studies conducted in Caucasian populations,,
    and the observed evidence in African American women was inconsistent,,,.', 'Numerous
    reasons may explain for the racial difference, including drinking habits, metabolism
    and genetic factors.', 'For example, there are racial differences in distributions
    of genetic polymorphisms related to ethanol metabolism,.', 'Traditionally, alcohol
    consumption among African women is less common compared with those in developed
    countries.', 'However, as women in Africa are increasingly influenced by western
    cultures and begin to change their lifestyle and as the populations in African
    countries are becoming more affluent, more and more women may be exposed to alcohol,,.',
  Few studies have investigated this relationship among African women., Our study
    is the first multi-country study using a large African women sample., The incidence
    of breast cancer is anticipated to increase in African countries such as in Nigeria.,
  Our study also found that women who were past drinkers  had almost the same elevated
    risk as women who were current drinkers., Our study showed a dose-response relationship
    between duration of alcohol drinking and breast cancer risk; women who drank for
    20 years or longer had almost twice the odds of being cancer cases compared with
    non-drinkers., 'This relationship was confirmed in some studies,  but not in others,.',
  'We did not find dose-response relationship between amount of alcohol intake and
    breast cancer risk, possibly because there were few heavy drinkers in our study
    population.', 'Studies have suggested that a moderate level of alcohol consumption  may
    be sufficient for increasing breast cancer risk,,, while other studies did not
    show that low-level consumption of alcohol increases breast cancer risk in premenopausal
    women.', The effect of alcohol drinking among nulliparous women was significantly
    elevated compared to that among parous women., 'This result is consistent with
    prior studies which suggests that the carcinogenic effect of alcohol consumption
    is strongest between menarche and the first full term pregnancy and could be implicated
    in both increased risk of breast cancer and benign breast disease,,.', Starting
    to drink at a young reproductive age  was associated with an increased risk of
    breast cancer in our study sample., 'This finding is consistent with other studies,,,.',
  'In addition, alcohol drinking among women with BMI &gt;25 kg/m2, clinically defined
    as overweight or obese, had a greater risk of developing breast cancer.', This
    suggests that obesity and alcohol drinking may have joint effects on risk of breast
    cancer among women., 'Being overweight or obese has been shown to be a risk factor
    for postmenopausal breast cancer,.', 'The proposed mechanism in both animal models
    and humans of the mediating effect of alcohol as well as adipositys effect on
    serum estradiol and insulin levels may account for the interaction effect observed
    between BMI and alcohol consumption,.', Heterogeneity in the level of alcohol
    consumption was observed among women in three African countries., 'Using a definition
    of alcohol drinking as having at least one drink every week for a continuous 6
    months or more, the percentage of ever drinkers in Nigeria, Cameroon, and Uganda
    were 5.0%, 34.6%, and 50.0%, respectively.', 'This is in line with previous surveys
    of alcohol consumption in the three countries, although it is not straightforward
    to directly compare with previous studies due to different definition of alcohol
    drinking.', 'According to the WHO country surveys conducted from 2003 to 2005,
    the percent of women who are lifetime abstainers in Nigeria, Cameroon, and Uganda
    were 50.9%, 39.8%, 36.7%, respectively,,.', Heterogeneity in the relationship
    between alcohol drinking and breast cancer was also observed across the three
    countries., 'In Nigeria and Cameroon, women who drank alcohol had a moderate increased
    risk of breast cancer compared to never-drinkers, whereas in Uganda there was
    only a marginal increase in risk.', A small sample size  may explain for these
    non-significant findings in Uganda., 'A previous study found that a larger proportion
    of Nigerian women who drank alcohol regularly tended to be heavy drinkers compared
    to Ugandan women, which may also account for the weak correlation between alcohol
    consumption and breast cancer risk for women in Uganda.', Larger sample size in
    Uganda and Cameroon are desirable to confirm these study findings., 'Although
    some studies have suggested that recall bias only had minor effects on alcohol
    reporting and on the estimation of risk for breast cancer, we could not exclude
    the possibility of recall bias in reporting alcohol consumption in our study.',
  'Due to the retrospective nature of the study, participants might have difficulty
    in recalling alcohol consumption patterns, especially if the patterns changed
    over time for older women.', 'In addition, cultural stigmas against alcohol use
    among women might also have resulted in under-reporting of alcohol consumption,,.',
  'Nigerian women might tend to under-report alcohol consumption, as it is often considered
    culturally inappropriate for them to drink alcohol outside of religious settings.',
  The majority of subjects in the study were considered to be light drinkers whereas
    there were few moderate and heavy drinkers., This observation could also account
    for the lack of a dose-response relationship with respect to the amount of alcohol
    consumed., 'Our study did not assess alcohol consumption at each stage of a womans
    life, and therefore, it was assumed that alcohol consumption was constant over
    a subjects lifetime.', 'Since ethanol and its primary metabolite, acetaldehyde,
    can affect estrogen levels and are involved in carcinogenic pathways, alcohol
    consumption later in life may further accelerate genetic mutations.', 'In conclusion,
    our study found a positive relationship between alcohol consumption and breast
    cancer risk among sub-Saharan African women.', 'The adoption of a Western lifestyle
    and erosion of many traditional customs that prohibited alcohol drinking has led
    to drastic changes in alcohol consumption patterns, including greater drinking
    among young people and women,,.', 'According to the 2011 WHO data, 25.3% of the
    population in Africa is displaying an increase in five-year trends for recorded
    adult per capita alcohol consumption.', 'Surveys from 2005 also show that in Nigeria
    and Uganda, total adult  per capita alcohol consumption  has already exceeded
    the per capita alcohol consumption in the United States.', 'If we assumed a common
    odds ratio of 1.62 and observed alcohol prevalence in the three countries, 4.6%,
    19.5%, and 20.1% of breast cancer cases can be attributed to alcohol drinking
    in Nigeria, Cameroon, and Uganda, respectively.', 'As breast cancer incidence
    is increasing in African countries and alcohol drinking is increasingly popular
    among African women,,,,,, public health programs in Africa should take proactive
    measures to prevent breast cancer through addressing the modifiable risk factor
    of alcohol consumption, including providing current information on the risk of
    alcohol consumption among women and advocating proper regulation of alcohol sale
    through more effective alcohol policies,,.', 'Multivariable logistic regression
