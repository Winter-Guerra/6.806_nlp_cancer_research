text: [Berries are gaining increasing importance lately for their chemopreventive
    and therapeutic potential against several cancers., 'In earlier studies, a blueberry-supplemented
    diet has shown protection against 17-estradiol -mediated mammary tumorigenesis.',
  This study tested both preventive and therapeutic activities of diet supplemented
    with whole blueberry powder., 'Animals received 5% blueberry diet, either 2 weeks
    prior to or 12 weeks after E2 treatment in preventive and therapeutic groups,
    respectively.', 'Both interventions delayed the tumor latency for palpable mammary
    tumors by 28 and 37 days, respectively.', Tumor volume and multiplicity were also
    reduced significantly in both modes., The effect on mammary tumorigenesis was
    largely due to down-regulation of CYP 1A1 and ER- gene expression and also favorable
    modulation of microRNA  levels., These data suggest that the blueberry blend tested
    is effective in inhibiting E2-mediated mammary tumorigenesis in both preventive
    and therapeutic modes., 'blueberry; estrogen; breast cancer; chemoprevention;
    chemotherapy; ACI rats; miRNA modulation; blood chemistry; hematopoietic parameters


    Breast cancer is the most common cancer among American women and the second leading
    cause of cancer deaths.', 'It is estimated that 232,340 women will be diagnosed
    with breast cancer and 39,620 will die in 2013.', 'Accumulating data from epidemiological
    and experimental studies have shown that reproductive hormones, particularly E2,
    play a significant role in breast cancer etiology.', Breast carcinogenesis is
    highly interlinked with the high levels of E2 and its metabolism to catechols
    mediated by cytochrome P450 enzymes., 'Other phase I and phase II enzymes involved
    in the metabolic activation and deactivation include estrone sulfatase, sulfotransferases,
    catechol-O-methyltransferase, and uridine-5-diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase.',
  The biological effects of E2 and its metabolites are mediated by two distinct E2
    receptors  by binding with varying affinities., 'MicroRNAs  are small noncoding
    RNAs, and their expressions have been correlated with specific breast cancer pathological
    features such as E2 and progesterone receptor expression, proliferation index,
    and tumor stage.', 'In an independent study, the expression of 667 miRNAs in 29
    breast tumor and 21 adjacent normal tissues demonstrate 130 miRNAs to have significant
    differential expressions in breast tumors when compared to the normal adjacent
    tissues.', 'miRNA expression is suppressed or stimulated by E2 and other E2 receptor
    ligands in human breast cancer cells, rat mammary gland, and other E2 responsive
    organs such as the endometrium and uterus.', There is growing evidence from in
    vitro and in vivo studies that consumption of fruits and vegetables is associated
    with reduced risk of developing cancer., 'Berries are rich in anthocyanins, which
    are considered to be a good candidate for preventing the development of cancer
    by protecting cells from the damage caused by reactive oxygen species.', 'There
    are over 500 anthocyanins characterized, but a great majority of them contain
    a core structure of six anthocyanidins, namely, cyanidin, delphinidin, malvidin,
    pelargonidin, peonidin, and petunidin.', 'Anthocyanins have mono-, di-, and tricyclic
    sugars attached to the anthocyanidin core structure and possess high antioxidant
    properties.', Berries have received much attention lately due to their cancer
    chemopreventive potential., Blueberry  is among the few fruits that contain five
    of the major anthocyanidins., 'Anthocyanins activate phase II enzymes and induce
    apoptosis as well as demonstrate antiproliferative, anti-inflammatory, and antiangiogenesis
    properties.', 'In our recent study, an equimolar mixture of five major anthocyanidins
    was found to synergistically inhibit proliferation of two non-small-cell lung
    cancer cell lines both in cell culture and in vivo.', 'In another study, we have
    demonstrated that dietary blueberry  when provided in chemoprevention mode  inhibited
    E2-mediated mammary tumorigenesis in ACI rats.', 'In this study, we report on
    both chemopreventive and therapeutic potential of highbush blueberry powder.',
  We also report the possible mechanism by which BB may inhibit mammary tumorigenesis.,
  Freeze-dried highbush whole blueberry powder  was received from the U.S. Highbush
    Blueberry Council., This blend contains 38 mg/g total phenolics and 21 mg/g total
    anthocyanins., AIN-93 M diet and AIN-93 M diet supplemented with 2.5 and 5% BB
    were prepared in pellet form by Harlan-Teklad  and stored at 4 C in vacuum-sealed
    bags until use., 'BB diet was customized to have the same calorific value as AIN-93
    M.


    Animal experiments were executed in agreement with an approved protocol from the
    Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Louisville.',
  'Female ACI rats  were purchased from Harlan SpragueDawley, Inc.. After a week of
    acclimation, animals were randomized into seven groups.', 'Groups 1, 4, and 7
    were provided with AIN-93 M diet, and groups 2 and 5 were fed a diet supplemented
    with BB.', Groups 3 and 6 received diet supplemented with 5% BB., 'After 2 weeks
    of experimental diet intervention, groups 47 were implanted subcutaneously with
    a 1.2 cm silastic implant containing 9 mg of 17-estradiol  as described.', Group
    7 received control AIN-93 M diet for 14 weeks and then was changed to BB diet  after
    the appearance of first palpable tumor in control group., 'As the BB diet in group
    7 started after the appearance of tumors, this was considered as therapeutic intervention.',
  Body weight and diet consumption were recorded weekly until euthanasia., 'Starting
    from 12 weeks of E2 treatment, animals were palpated weekly for tumor incidence
    and multiplicity.', 'When the palpable tumors reached &gt;90% in group 4, animals
    in all groups were euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation.', Blood was collected by cardiac
    puncture to isolate serum and plasma., 'Lung, liver, brain, mammary tissue, and
    pituitary gland were collected, weighed, and snap frozen for further analysis.',
  Mammary tumor size was measured by a Vernier caliper., Small pieces of mammary tissue
    and pituitary gland were fixed in 10% formalin for histopathological analysis.,
  'To assess the presence of microscopic tumors and pathological changes in the mammary
    glands of rats treated with E2 for 12 weeks, 5 m mammary tissue sections  from
    multiple previous studies were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and analyzed
    by a board-certified veterinary pathologist.', Tissue sections from five randomly
    selected animals from each group were stained for proliferating cell nuclear antigen  using
    a PCNA staining kit  following the manufacturers protocol., Five to six different
    sites in each slide were scored for deeply stained epithelial nuclei by two cytopathologists
    and represented as percent deeply stained cells., Plasma prolactin levels were
    quantified using a Rat Prolactin ELISA Immuno-assay kit  following the manufacturers
    instructions., 'Briefly, plasma samples  from E2-treated groups were diluted 100-
    or 200-fold, and plasma from groups that did not receive E2 was diluted 2-fold
    prior to the analysis.', The samples were added to a 96-well plate incubated with
    rat prolactin sample buffer followed by enzyme-labeled anti-rat prolactin antibody.,
  'Then samples were incubated with 3,3,5,5-tetramethylbenzidine  and substrate solution  followed
    by measurement of the optical density at 450 nm immediately after the addition
    of stop solution.', About 25 L of diluted plasma samples was measured against
    various concentrations of calibrator samples ranging from 5 to 80 ng/mL of prolactin
    levels., Western blot analysis was done as described elsewhere., 'Briefly, whole-cell
    lysates were prepared from mammary tissues using radioimmunoprecipitation assay  lysis
    buffer, and protein concentrations were measured by using the bicinchoninic acid  method.',
  Proteins were separated on MES-SDS-Bis-Tris 412% gradient gel., 'The proteins were
    transferred to PVDF membranes and probed for cyclin D1, PCNA, estrogen receptor-alpha,
    c-myc, and progesterone receptor.', Equal loading of the protein was confirmed
    by -actin., Total RNA from frozen mammary tissues was isolated using Trizol reagent.,
  RNA concentrations were measured by NanoDrop., qRT-PCR was performed with 100 ng
    of RNA using a qScript One-Step SYBR Green qRT-PCR Kit  with 500 pmol of forward
    and reverse primers for each gene., 'The genes and primer sequences are as follows:
    CYP1A1 ; ER- ; 18S.', 'Quantitative PCR was carried out on a 7500 Fast-Real Time
    PCR instrument, following the manufacturers guideline.', The gene expressions
    were calculated by relative quantification method  comparing with control and
    normalizing to 18S RNA., Small RNAs  were isolated from mammary tissues using
    a mirVana microRNA isolation kit  following the manufacturers instruction., The
    concentration of the small RNA was quantified by Bioanalyzer., 'qPCR analysis
    of miR-18a, miR20a, miR25, and miR-34c was performed using a TaqMan miRNA Reverse
    Transcription Kit and TaqMan gene-specific miRNA assays  according to the manufacturers
    instructions.', Relative changes in miRNA expressions were quantified by comparison
    with the control and normalization to 5S RNA., 'Whole blood was collected at the
    time of euthanasia to analyze serum chemistry and hematological parameters, as
    described previously.', 'Liver functions were analyzed by measuring the levels
    of aspartate transaminase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, -glutamyl
    transpeptidase, and amylase in serum.', 'Kidney functions were analyzed by measuring
    blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and various electrolytes in serum.', 'Various
    hematological parameters such as white blood cells, red blood cells, hemoglobin,
    hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, mean corpuscular
    hemoglobin concentration, and platelet count were analyzed from whole blood.',
  Five random samples from each group were analyzed., All statistical comparisons
    between controls and E2-treated groups were made using an unpaired one-tailed
    Students t test., Tumor latency was analyzed using a nonparametric log-rank test.,
  'Diet consumption was analyzed using an unpaired two-tailed Students t test, and
    body weight was analyzed by two-way ANOVA.', 'All statistical analyses were done
    in GraphPad prism software, version 4.3.', A p value of 0.05 was considered significant.,
  'There was no significant difference in diet consumption among groups receiving
    either control diet or AIN-93 M diet supplemented with 2.5 and 5% BB, in the absence
    of E2 treatment.', 'The diet consumption, however, increased in E2-treated animals
    fed control diet or BB-supplemented diets.', The increase was significant in animals
    receiving the 5% BB diet in both preventive and therapeutic mode; the increase
    was insignificant in the 2.5% BB diet group., 'At the end of the study, one-way
    ANOVA analysis showed no significant difference in body weights among the control
    and E2-treated animals.', Figure 1., 'Average diet consumption and body weight:.',

    either AIN-93 M or BB diet., One-way ANOVA analysis showed that there was no significant
    difference in body weight after 25 weeks of E2 treatment., BB diet was highly
    effective in favorably modulating the various tumor indices., BB diet dose dependently
    delayed the tumor latency., 'The groups receiving 5% BB diet in both the chemopreventive
    and therapeutic modes had a significant delay with the first tumor appearance
    in the control group by 28 and 37 days, respectively, as compared to the age-matched
    control animals.', 'The group that received 2.5% BB diet also had delayed tumor
    latency but only slightly, about 7 days.', 'At the end of the study, the control
    group developed palpable mammary tumors in 96% animals, whereas animals provided
    with the 5% BB diet in chemopreventive and therapeutic groups had palpable tumors
    only in 60%  and 55%  of animals, respectively; the 2.5% BB diet also showed some  but
    insignificant reduction in tumor incidence compared to the control group.', Tumor
    volume and multiplicity were measured after the animals had been euthanized.,
  'Animals receiving control diet had an average tumor volume of 979  218 mm3, whereas
    animals on the 5% BB diet had significant reductions, 512  130 mm3  and 452  144
    mm3, for chemopreventive and therapeutic mode, respectively.', Animals on the
    2.5% BB diet showed a modest but insignificant  reduction with an average tumor
    volume of 698  145 mm3., 'Tumor multiplicity in control animals was 4.17  0.48
    per animal, and it was reduced to 2.17  0.52  and 1.75  0.45  by the 5% BB diet
    given in chemopreventive and therapeutic mode, respectively ; the 2.5% BB diet
    also showed a significant reduction in tumor multiplicity, 2.75  0.45.', Figure
    2., 'Effect of blueberry diet on  tumor incidence,  tumor volume, and  tumor multiplicity.',
  Tumor incidence was calculated from the weekly palpation report and analyzed using
    a nonparametric log-rank test., Asterisk indicates significant difference of 5%
    BB diet  from E2-treated control., Tumor volume and multiplicity were calculated
    at the time of euthanasia and analyzed using unpaired one-tailed Students t test.,
  Asterisk indicates that the tumor volume of both 5% BB diets  was significantly
    different from E2-treated control., 'At the end of the study, the liver, mammary,
    and pituitary tissue weights were not significantly different among the groups
    without E2 treatment.', 'However, the differences were significant with E2 treatment.',
  Mammary tissue weight with 5% BB diet in chemopreventive mode was modestly offset  from
    E2-treated control., 'There was a 45-fold increase in the pituitary weight in
    E2-treated animals; however, this was significantly offset with the 5% BB diet
    in preventive  and therapeutic  modes.', Pituitary weights in animals receiving
    the 2.5% BB diet also showed significant decrease., Table 2., "Comparison of Body
    Weight and Other Organ Weightsa between ACI Rats Fed Control Diet or Diet Supplemented
    with Blueberry  \n\nValues that are significantly higher than E2-treated animals.",
  Average body weight of animals is measured at the time of euthanasia., 'In all animals
    that were treated with E2 for 12 weeks, there was expansion of mammary tissue
    with proliferation of terminal buds that differentiated into acini.', 'The acinar
    epithelial cells were frequently vacuolated, and the acini contained amphophilic
    inspissated secretory material filling the lumina.', 'Concomitantly, there was
    proliferation of ductules and ducts with variable grades of epithelial dysplasia.',
  The ductular epithelial cells were cuboidal with distinct cell borders and moderate
    amounts of eosinophilic cytoplasm., 'Often, the nuclei showed karyomegaly and
    were hyperchromatic, containing one to three distinct nucleoli.', Mitotic figures
    were not present in the sections examined., 'In &gt;50% of cases, the ducts were
    ectatic and lined by hyperplastic epithelium that formed two or more layers.',
  Ductular adenomas  were characterized by the development of a 100250 m long papillary
    projection from the ductular walls that narrowed the lumina., The neoplastic cells
    contained scant cytoplasm and round nuclei with one to three distinct nucleoli.,
  'In all cases, desquamated epithelial cells were present within the ductular lumina.',
  Prominent periductular fibrosis was a feature of all adenomas., Multifocal perivascular
    mast cell infiltration correlated with the severity of the lesion in all cases.,
  'In addition, the ductular epithelial dysplasia correlated with the size of expansion
    of the terminal bud.', Figure 3., Presence of epithelial dysplasia and ductular
    papillomas from mammary tissue of rats treated with E2 implant for 12 weeks.,

    containing one to three distinct nucleoli.', Cell proliferation was analyzed by
    staining tumor and adjacent mammary tissue for PCNA protein markers using antibody-based
    assay., 'After 25 weeks, there was no significant difference in cell proliferation
    among animals receiving either control or 2.5 and 5% BB diets.', 'However, the
    E2 treatment increased the cell proliferation to nearly 6-fold.', 'This increase
    in the cell proliferation was significantly offset by 34 and 35% with 5% BB diet
    administered in chemopreventive and therapeutic mode, respectively ; the effect
    was insignificant with the 2.5% BB diet.', Figure 4., Proliferative index and

    control., No significant difference was observed in the levels of plasma prolactin
    between untreated groups and BB diet groups., 'On the other hand, there was a
    substantial increase  in prolactin levels with E2 treatment  compared to untreated
    control.', 'After 25 weeks, animals provided with 5% BB diet in chemopreventive  and
    therapeutic mode  demonstrated significant reduction in the elevated levels of
    plasma prolactin.', A modest but insignificant reduction in prolactin levels  was
    also observed with the 2.5% BB diet., Figure 5., Circulating plasma prolactin
    levels among rats receiving either control diet or diet supplemented with 2.5
    and 5% BB., Values represent the average of six samples  SE done in duplicates.,
  a Statistically significant from untreated control., b Statistically significant
    from E2-treated control., There was a pronounced effect of E2 on the expressions
    of cytochrome CYP 1A1 and ER- at the mRNA levels., 'All groups were compared against
    the untreated control, and the fold change was expressed as mean  standard error.',
  E2 treatment up-regulated the CYP 1A1 mRNA levels by 60-fold., 'The 5% BB intervention
    provided in chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic modes both significantly offset
    the E2-associated increase in CYP1A1 to 28.3  6-fold  and 27.6  10.3-fold, respectively.',
  'Similarly, the mRNA expression level of ER- in E2-treated animals was up-regulated
    by 19.7  2-fold compared to untreated control, and this increase was also significantly
    offset by the 5% BB diet, chemopreventive mode  and therapeutic mode.', Western
    blot analysis showed that E2 treatment up-regulated both cyclin D1 and PCNA.,
  Intervention of 5% BB diet in both preventive and therapeutic modes down-regulated
    cyclin D1 and PCNA at protein levels., 'However, ER- protein level was not modulated
    with either E2 treatment or administration of BB diet.', Figure 6.  mRNA expression
    of CYP1A1 and ER- in mammary tissues., The total RNA isolated from the mammary
    tissue was analyzed by qPCR., Data represent the average of four animals  SE.,
  Asterisk represents significant difference from E2-treated control., 'Protein expression
    of cyclin D1, PCNA, and ER- in mammary tissue.', The total cellular lysate isolated
    from the mammary tissues was analyzed by Western blot., We analyzed four E2-specific
    miRNAs  on the basis of our previous study in this animal model to determine the
    effect of BB treatment on their modulation., All four miRNAs were significantly
    up-regulated under the influence of E2 intervention in agreement with our previous
    findings., 'miR-18a and miR-34c were up-regulated about 13- and 11-fold, respectively,
    compared to untreated control.', 'The effect of E2 on miR-18a and miR-34c was
    reduced to 6.4-fold  and 4.9-fold, respectively, with the 5% BB diet in therapeutic
    mode.', 'Berry diet given in chemopreventive mode also offset these two elevated
    miRNAs, but the effect was not as pronounced.', There was no significant effect
    of BB treatment on the up-regulated miR-20a and miR-25 expression levels., Figure
    7., Expression of miRNAs 18a and 34c in mammary tissues., The small RNA was isolated
    by mirVana microRNA kit and quantified by Bioanalyzer., qPCR analysis was performed
    using a TaqMan microRNA Reverse Triscription Kit and TaqMan gene-specific MicroRNA
    assays., Graph represents the average of four rats  SE done in duplicates., Asterisk
    indicates significant difference from E2-treated control., 'Analysis of serum
    for liver enzymes such as aspartate transaminase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline
    phosphatase, -glutamyl transpeptidase, amylase, and lipase indicated that they
    were within the normal range, and no difference was found with E2 or BB diet or
    in combination compared to control, suggesting that berry diets had no toxic effects.',
  'Serum was analyzed for plasma proteins, glucose, cholesterol, and triglycerides.',
  'Analysis of blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and various electrolytes showed no
    significant changes, indicating normal kidney functions with BB treatment.', 'Whole
    blood from all of the groups was analyzed for hematological parameters such as
    white blood cells, red blood cells, hemoglobin, hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume,
    mean corpuscular hemoglobin, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, and platelets.',
  No difference in any of the hematological parameters was found in any group compared
    to aged-matched control animals., The levels of neutrophils and lymphocytes measured
    in whole blood showed no significant difference among all groups., Table 3., "Serum
    and Hematological Parameters for Assessment of Toxicity and Tolerance of Blueberry
    Diet  \n\nCancer chemopreventive agents are either natural products or their synthetic
    analogues, which inhibit the transformation of normal cells to premalignant cells
    or the progression of premalignant cells to malignant cells.", 'It is believed
    that chemopreventive agents can inhibit oncogenic pathways, inhibit growth, and
    induce apoptosis in cancer cells.', Conventional chemopreventive agents are administered
    long-term and believed to block or delay the progression of transformed cells
    by modulating cell proliferation or differentiation., 'They also prevent activation
    of carcinogen, trap carcinogen before reaching the active site, and enhance detoxification
    systems.', 'On the other hand, standard therapeutic drugs are toxic to both cancer
    and normal cells, which results in therapeutic activity and side effects to normal
    cells.', Cytotoxicity to normal cells may lead to secondary tumors., This study
    was conducted to test both the chemopreventive and therapeutic potential of Tifblue
    and Rubel blueberry blend against E2-mediated mammary tumorigenesis., We had previously
    reported on the chemopreventive effect of Berkley blueberry on mammary tumorigenesis.,
  This is the first study of its kind in which the therapeutic potential of blueberry
    has been shown., We also confirmed the microscopic tumors and precancerous conditions
    by histological evaluation of mammary gland sections from rats treated and necropsied
    at 12 weeks of E2 treatment., 'Variable ductular epithelial changes including
    dysplasia, hyperplasia, and adenoma formation were found, suggesting various stages
    of carcinogenesis.', 'In addition, periductular fibroplasia as well as mast cell
    infiltration positively correlated with degree of dysplasia.', 'Similar to our
    earlier studies this TifblueRubel blueberry blend at 2.5 and 5% given in the chemopreventive
    mode was highly effective in increasing the tumor latency by 7 and 28 days, respectively.',
  The administration of 2.5% BB diet showed significant reduction in tumor multiplicity
    and pituitary weight., 'In our earlier studies, 2.5% BB diet made from the mixture
    of three blueberries was not effective against E2 treatment; this could be because
    the E2 implant size was 3 cm long containing 27 mg of E2.', 'In another study
    with a similar 9 mg E2 implant, a 2.5% diet showed protective effects that were
    in the same vicinity as reported by us previously.', 'In both studies, the 2.5%
    BB diet had only modest effect and did not significantly reduce the tumor volume,
    tumor latency, and molecular markers investigated.', 'The higher dose of BB  administered
    in chemopreventive mode was highly protective in reducing tumor volume and tumor
    multiplicity and increased tumor latency to 28 days, in agreement with our previous
    findings.', 'However, the protective effect of blueberry was slackened after 20
    weeks of E2 treatment, likely due to the exponential growth rate of the cells
    to reach the malignant stage.', For the first time BB diet was administered after
    12 weeks of E2 treatment to determine the therapeutic effect against precancerous
    and microscopic adenomas., 'When compared with animals that received 5% BB diet
    in chemopreventive mode, the therapeutic group showed a significantly enhanced
    effect by reducing tumor volume and multiplicity and increasing the tumor latency
    to 37 days, that is, 9 days more than the preventive groups.', 'Even when the
    BB diet was initiated after 14 weeks of E2 treatment, the therapeutic group elicited
    protective effects.', The therapeutic potential of BB anthocyanidins has been
    shown by others against human prostate cancer and by us against lung cancer xenograft.,
  'However, there is no study for direct comparison in E2-induced mammary tumorigenesis.',
  'Interestingly, the present data also suggest that BB diet can be started in the
    postinitiation stage of tumorigenesis and still elicit a response similar to that
    of chemopreventive mode.', Bioavailability of anthocyanins in vivo is crucial
    for their biological effects., Anthocyanins are absorbed intact in the glycosidic
    form., They are rapidly absorbed from the stomach and jejunum., 'Yet &gt;50% of
    the ingested anthocyanins are found in the cecum, implying poor absorption.',
  'Anthocyanin structure exists as a flavilium cation in acidic conditions, which
    is stable, but converts to unstable quinoidal or carbinol structure at neutral
    or alkaline conditions.', 'However, it has also been shown that anthocyanins are
    stabilized by flavanols and ascorbic acid present in the food matrix.', 'This
    may explain the higher bioavailability of anthocyanins when given as a whole fruit
    powder relative to individual anthocyanins, indicating strong synergism occurs
    in absorption between coexisting molecules in fruit.', 'Furthermore, in a study
    with healthy subjects with ileostomy, nearly 40% of anthocyanins were recovered
    in the ileal fluid, indicating that despite the difference in pH, the anthocyanins
    were stable and large amounts will pass from the small intestine to the large
    intestine.', 'Yet, all of the bioavailability studies were done with bolus doses
    of pure anthocyanins or fruit powder/extracts.', Anthocyanins were not detected
    in the plasma of animals fed a diet mixed with sources rich in anthocyanins or
    the pure compound., 'However, lack of detection of anthocyanins in the plasma
    does not indicate lack of tissue bioavailability.', 'When anthocyanins were delivered
    intravenously, a biphasic decay of plasma levels was observed, indicating tissue
    distribution.', 'In a parallel publication in this issue, we have discussed in
    detail the bioavailability of anthocyanins and its levels in lung tissue.', 'We
    have demonstrated the presence of all five anthocyanidins, delphinidin, cyanidin,
    peonidin, petunidin, and malvidin, in lung tissues.', 'Thus, anthocyanins are
    bioavailable and bioaccumulate in non-gastrointestinal tissues.', 'In agreement
    with our previous studies, the effect of E2 was reflected in the body, liver,
    mammary, and pituitary weights of the animals.', The transitory increase in body
    weight and organ weight is majorly due to the E2 and may not be due to the diet
    consumption., 'Moreover, control AIN-93 M diet and diets supplemented with 2.5
    and 5% BB were isocaloric.', 'Although there was no effect of BB diet on body
    weight gain and organ weights, it was found to significantly offset E2-associated
    elevation in the weight of pituitary tumors.', 'The pituitary weight was affected
    due to the increase in plasma prolactin levels induced by E2, resulting in pituitary
    prolactinomas.', 'However, the E2-mediated mammary tumor model was well studied
    and standardized to reduce the side effect to the pituitary gland.', Earlier studies
    have shown that prolonged supply of E2 increases the production of prolactin in
    E2-sensitive rat strains., High circulatory levels of prolactin in serum are one
    of the major reasons for animals to develop E2-induced mammary tumors., Berry
    diet at 2.5 and 5% significantly offset the prolactin levels elevated by E2.,
  'E2 also induces the production of phase I enzyme, CYP1A1.', 'It catalyzes the conversion
    of E2 into its metabolites, which further undergo redox cycle leading to the formation
    of reactive oxygen species.', 'In this study, we showed that BB diet significantly
    reduced the expression of CYP1A1, suggesting its protective role against mammary
    carcinogenesis.', Studies have shown that cyclin D1 and E2 receptors have important
    roles in regulating proliferation of breast epithelial cells., It is well established
    that E2 via ER- elicits rapid signals driving cancer cells to proliferation.,
  This biological effect of E2-mediated by ER- was reduced significantly in 5% BB
    diet provided in therapeutic mode., Regulation of cyclin D1 gene expression has
    been associated with changes in the proliferation rate of breast cancer cells.,
  Induction of cyclin D1 expression occurs rapidly and is a critical feature of the
    mitogenic action of E2., 'The expression of cyclin D1 was down-regulated by 22.6-fold
    with 5% BB diet in chemopreventive and therapeutic modes, respectively.', Investigation
    of PCNA in nuclear proteins revealed that dietary BB reduced the expression levels
    significantly., 'PCNA was shown to interact with ER- both in the absence and in
    the presence of DNA, to enhance the interaction of ER- with ERE-containing DNA,
    and associate with endogenous E2-responsive genes.', These findings clearly indicate
    that BB diet could modulate major E2-associated proliferation markers that lead
    to protective effects against mammary tumorigenesis in animals treated with E2.,
  Another interesting finding in this study is from the analysis of miRNAs related
    to the ER- family., 'Aberrant miRNA expression is implicated in E2-related breast,
    uterine, and ovarian cancer development and progression.', Hormones play a crucial
    role in regulating miRNAs by both genomic  and nongenomic mechanisms., Lorio et
    al., 'identified miRNAs having expression correlated with specific breast cancer
    biopathologic features, such as E2 and progesterone receptor expression, tumor
    stage, vascular invasion, or proliferation index.', Targeting specific miRNAs
    for inhibiting specific stages of a cancer is being explored., Several miRNAs
    that regulate ER are involved in synchronized feedback mechanisms as a component
    of ER activation., Many of these ER-regulating miRNAs therefore are either E2-inducible  or
    subject to E2-mediated repression., This laboratory has recently identified miRNAs
    that modulated under the influence of E2 in this animal model and report aberrant
    changes in miRNA expression profile as early as 3 weeks of E2 treatment., 'We
    chose four miRNAs, miR-18a, -20a, -25, and -34c, on the basis of our previous
    study where these miRNAs were up-regulated with E2 to understand the influence
    of BB diet on their modulation.', Increases in miR-18a and miR-20a mature forms
    were observed after E2 stimulation., 'In this study, BB diet administered in therapeutic
    mode significantly reduced miR-18a and miR-34c, whereas chemopreventive mode showed
    modest but significant reduction.', These findings provide initial insights of
    BB diet in decreasing the E2-induced miRNA levels., 'However, the BB diet failed
    to modulate miR-20a and -25 expression levels, which remain the subject of further
    investigation.', 'In the chemopreventive mode, the rats are fed BB diet as young
    as 67 weeks old.', The relative enhanced effect observed with the therapeutic
    approach could be due to the adaptive response of the rats to the BB phytochemicals
    in the chemopreventive mode., 'For example, the CYP1A1 mRNA level in mammary tissue
    was highest at 3 weeks after E2 implant and gradually decreased with time.', 'The
    effect of the BB phytochemicals was more pronounced in the inhibition of conversion
    of normal cells to precancerous or precancerous frank tumors, but were not as
    effective once the tumors reached the exponential growth rate.', 'Thus, by the
    time the mammary cells started exhibiting precancerous conditions, the efficacy
    was better when BB phytochemicals were introduced into the system than when they
    were already in the circulation.', 'Nevertheless, both approaches were effective
    in delaying the onset and growth of palpable tumors.', 'In summary, this is the
    first demonstration indicating that BB diet is highly protective even in preinitiated
    E2-mediated mammary tumors in ACI rats through its effects by modulating cell
    proliferation and molecular targets.', 'Thus, the consumption of BB can be used
    as an effective strategy for the treatment of E2-associated breast cancer and
    possible prevention of its relapse and metastasis.', Our study demonstrates the
    chemopreventive and therapeutic potential of blueberry and advances our understanding
    of the working mechanisms in search of potential future drugs., 'This work was
