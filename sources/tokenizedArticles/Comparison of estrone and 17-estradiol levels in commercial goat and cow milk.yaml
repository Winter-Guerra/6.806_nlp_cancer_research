text: [Increased levels of estrogen metabolites are believed to be associated with
    cancers of the reproductive system., One potential dietary source of these metabolites
    that is commonly consumed worldwide is milk., 'In North America, dairy cows are
    the most common source of milk; however, goats are the primary source of milk
    worldwide.', 'In this study, the absolute concentrations of unconjugated and total  estrone  and
    17-estradiol  were compared in a variety of commercial cow milks  and goat milk.',
  A lower combined concentration of E1 and E2 was found in goat milk than in any of
    the cow milk products tested., The differences in E1 and E2 levels between regular
    and organic cow milks were not as significant as the differences between goat
    milk and any of the cow milk products., Goat milk represents a better dietary
    choice for individuals concerned with limiting their estrogen intake.]
