text: ['Major phenolic compounds from basil, lemon thyme, mint, oregano, rosemary,
    sage, and thyme were investigated using a high-performance liquid chromatography  profiling
    technique in combination with DPPH-radical scavenging, xanthine oxidase and cyclooxygenase
    assays.', 'For the present study, 15 plant-derived phenolic compounds  were selected
    and their DPPH-radical scavenging activities were first determined.', 'Then, a
    standard HPLC profiling of these phenolics was constructed using an HPLC method
    to isolate anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory phenolic compounds from MeOH extracts
    of the plants.', 'Rosmarinic acid was identified as a major anti-oxidant compound  in
    all seven herbs, confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance.', Rosmarinic acid from
    the plants quenched superoxide radicals from xanthine oxidase and inhibited cyclooxygenase
    I and II enzymes., 'In this study, the rosmarinic acid content of perilla was
    also determined and compared with those of the seven herbs.']
