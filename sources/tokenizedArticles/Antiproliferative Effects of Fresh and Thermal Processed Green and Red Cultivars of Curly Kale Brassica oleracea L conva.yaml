text: [Brassica vegetables contain a diverse range of phytochemicals with biological
    properties such as antioxidant and anticancer activity., 'However, knowledge about
    how biological activities are affected by processing is lacking.', 'A green cultivar
    and a red cultivar of curly kale were evaluated for water/methanol-soluble phytochemicals
    before and after processing involving blanching, freeze storage, and boil-in-bag
    heat treatment.', 'In both kale cultivars, processing resulted in a significant
    decrease of total phenolics, antioxidant capacity, and content and distribution
    of flavonols, anthocyanins, hydroxycinnamic acids, glucosinolates, and vitamin
    C. Interestingly, the red curly kale cultivar had a higher capacity to withstand
    thermal loss of phytochemicals.', The extracts of both green and red curly kale
    inhibited the cell proliferation of three human colon cancer cell lines., 'However,
    extracts from fresh plant material had a significantly stronger antiproliferative
    effect than extracts from processed plant material.', 'curly kale; heat processing;

    Vegetables from the Brassica family are among the most commonly grown vegetables
    worldwide.', 'Studies have shown a relation between consumption of Brassica vegetables
    and cancer, particularly in the gastrointestinal system.', 'The anticancer effects
    have usually been dedicated to the glucosinolates and their degradation products,
    often without a thorough investigation of other potential bioactive compounds
    found in Brassica vegetables.', 'Thus, it is not well understood which constituents
    are responsible for these anticancer effects or whether these effects are a consequence
    of synergistic action of several constituents.Brassica vegetables are known to
    contain a complex mixture of health-related phytochemicals, including vitamin
    C, phenolic compounds, and glucosinolates, which differ in a species-specific
    manner.', 'The main phenolic compounds found in Brassica vegetables are flavonoids
    and phenolic acids, both of which predominantly exist as molecules in conjugated
    forms.', 'The most ubiquitous subclass of the flavonoids is the flavonols, with
    the most abundant aglycons quercetin and kaempferol.', 'Another flavonoid subclass
    found in Brassica is the anthocyanins, responsible for the purple red color.',
  'In plant tissue, flavonols and anthocyanins are present as sugar conjugates and
    are often acylated with hydroxycinnamic acids.', 'Flavonoids are shown to possess
    a remarkable spectrum of biological and pharmacological activities at nontoxic
    concentrations, suggesting that they significantly affect basic cell functions,
    such as growth, differentiation, and/or programmed cell death.', 'However, although
    some epidemiological studies have provided evidence that a high dietary intake
    of flavonoids could be associated with low cancer prevalence in humans, others
    have not found such association.', Curly kale  is a leafy green- or red/purple-colored
    vegetable belonging to the Brassicaceae family., The plant is robust and tolerates
    a broad range of agricultural and climatic conditions., It has a lively pungent
    flavor with bitter peppery qualities., 'However, a light frost will produce sweeter
    and more flavorful kale leaves.', 'Among the Brassica vegetables, kale has been
    reported to exhibit the highest antioxidant capacity and high concentrations of
    vitamins, minerals, dietary fiber, glucosinolates, carotenoids, flavonoids, and
    phenolic acids.', Brassica vegetables can be subjected to various forms of processing
    to make them more suitable for human consumption., 'Common processing steps include
    blanching, freezing, cooking, and, occasionally, warm-holding.', Culinary processing
    affects the plant tissue and the phytochemicals present and may lead to alteration
    in health-related qualities., Processing may influence phytochemicals positively
    by releasing compounds and increasing their bioavailability or negatively by physical
    loss and chemical degradation of the phytochemicals., 'Thus, it is crucial to
    gain more knowledge on the fate and final concentration of the phytochemicals
    before and after food processing to estimate the availability of the phytochemicals
    in the human diet.', 'Some studies regarding thermal processing of curly kale
    have been conducted, but without further investigation of the bioactive functions
    of the kale phytochemicals.', 'The aim of the present study was to determine the
    antiproliferative effects of both fresh and thermal processed green and red cultivars
    of curly kale, with characterized contents of phenolic compounds, ascorbic acid,
    glucosinolates, and isothiocyanates, as well as antioxidant capacity.', 'The cooking
    method boil-in-bag was chosen to investigate the fate of selected health-related
    phytochemicals, as this pouch technology most likely will play an important role
    in culinary treatment of blanched/frozen vegetables in catering, professional
    kitchens, and the retail market in the future.', 'Gallic acid, l-ascorbic acid,
    l-dehydroascorbic acid, quercetin, quercetin-3-rhamnosylglucoside, 1,2-benzenedithiole,
    2-propenylglucosinolate, sulfatase, sodium tetraborate, staurosporine, MTT solution,
    and FolinCiocalteus phenol reagent were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co.. Chlorogenic
    acid hemihydrate, 2,4,6-tripyridyl-s-trizine, and 6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethyl-2-carboxylic
    acid  were purchased from Fluka Chemie GmbH.', 'Sodium carbonate, methanol, acetonitrile,
    and formic acid were obtained from Merck KGAa.', Cyanidin-3-glucoside was purchased
    from Polyphenols Laboratories AS., DEAE Sephadex A25 was purchased from Amersham
    Bioscience., 'All solvents were of HPLC grade, and the water used was of Milli-Q
    quality.', 'Dulbeccos modified Eagles medium, McCoys 5A medium, fetal calf serum,
    nonessential amino acids, and penicillin/streptomycin were purchased from Gibco.',
  Apo-ONE homogeneous caspase-3/7 assay was purchased from Promega., 'The green and
    red cultivars of curly kale, Alef.', var., 'sabellica L., Reflex and Redbor) were
    grown at an experimental field at the Norwegian University of Life Sciences  in
    2010.', 'The curly kale plants were harvested approximately 140 days after transplantation
    into the field, in mid-September.', 'The same day as harvested, five curly kale
    plants of the green and the red cultivars, respectively, were randomly picked
    and rinsed for stalks and ripped into pieces of 5  5 cm.', 'Leaves from each of
    the five plants, approximately 1/4 of the curly kale material, were pooled and
    immersed in portions into a mortar filled with liquid nitrogen and ground until
    a homogeneous plant material was achieved.', The samples of ground green and red
    curly kale were stored at 80 C until extraction., 'The remaining 3/4 of the green
    and red cultivars of curly kale material was blanched, freeze stored, and heat-treated
    using the boil-in-bag technology.', Blanching of the kale material was carried
    out by immersing the leaves  into boiling water  in a cooking vessel  for 2 min
    with a blanching temperature ranging from 99 to 100 C. The plant material was
    stirred gently during the blanching period., The blanched leaf pieces were cooled
    in icewater until the temperature of the water reached 15 C and centrifuged  to
    remove excess water from the kale material., 'Portions  of the the blanched kale
    were uniformly packed in vacuum pouches  PA/PE, Linpac Plastics, tolerant for
    heat up to 121 C) and vacuumed.', The vacuum-packed curly kale was stored at 40
    C for 13 weeks until further heat processing., The frozen pouches of kale were
    thawed at 4 C in the dark overnight., The pouches with thawed kale were held on
    ice until they were placed in a steam oven holding at 100 C  with 100% steam.,
  The boil-in-bags were heated for 17 min before the sealed pouches were left to cool
    in icewater for 30 min., The heating time had been optimized in another study  to
    have a core temperature above 72 C for 10 min in the kale., The temperature was
    recorded using temperature loggers in the core of the boil-in-bags., 'After cooling,
    the processed plant material was removed from the bags, submerged in liquid nitrogen,
    ground to a coarse powder in a porcelain mortar, and stored at 80 C until extraction.',
  This heating process was repeated three times on different days., 'Extraction with
    methanol was performed as previously described, and TP, FRAP, TMA, vitamin C,
    flavonol, phenolic acid, anthocyanin, glucosinolate, and isothiocyanate contents
    of curly kale methanolic extracts were determined.', Pooled extracts from fresh
    curly kale and pooled extracts from the three thermal experiments of each cultivar
    were concentrated 15 times using a rotary evaporator  at 30 C. The concentrated
    curly kale extracts were used in the experiments where cell proliferation and
    apoptosis were studied., 'TP, FRAP, glucosinolate, and vitamin C contents were
    determined in the concentrated extracts.', The dry matter content of fresh and
    processed kale material was determined by vacuum drying plant material  at 70
    C for 24 h in a vacuum oven., The TP content of curly kale methanolic extracts
    was determined according to the FolinCiocalteu method as described by Waterhouse
    with some modifications as previously described., The TP content was determined
    with the use of an external standard curve and expressed as milligrams of gallic
    acid equivalents  per 100 g fresh weight of kale  or milligrams of gallic acid
    equivalents per liter of extracts., All extracts were analyzed in duplicate.,
  The TMA content of curly kale methanolic extracts was determined according to the
    pH differential method with some modification as previously described., TMA was
    calculated as described in the method protocol using a molar absorptivity of 26
    900 L/ and molar mass of 449.2 g/mol for cyanidin-3-glucoside and expressed as
    milligrams of cyanidin-3-glucoside equivalents  per 100 g fresh weight of kale.,
  All extracts were analyzed in duplicate., The antioxidant capacity was determined
    using the FRAP assay as described by Benzie et al., with some modifications.,
  'Briefly, 190 L of freshly prepared FRAP reagent containing 10 mM TPTZ in 40 mM
    HCl, 20 mM FeCl36H2O, and 300 mM acetate buffer, pH 3.6, in a ratio of 1:1:10  was
    mixed with 10 L of the appropriate diluted sample.', The mixture was allowed to
    stand for 60 min at room temperature before absorption was measured at 593 nm.,
  The FRAP values were determined with the use of an aqueous solution of Fe  in the
    concentration range of 1251000 mol/L and expressed as millimoles of Fe equivalents
    per 100 g fresh weight of kale  or millimoles of Fe equivalents per liter of extract.,
  'Trolox was used as a control, and all extracts were diluted and analyzed in duplicate.',
  The vitamin C content in the curly kale methanolic extracts was determined as l-ascorbic
    acid  and l-dehydroascorbic acid., 'The extracts were dried using N2 gas, and
    the material was resolved to its original volume using 1% formic acid and further
    diluted  with TrizmaOPAEDTA before l-ascorbic acid analysis.', 'Reduction of DHAA
    in the sample was performed by mixing 50 L of TrizTCEP phosphine, pH 9) with 100
    L extracts dissolved in 1% formic acid and incubated for 20 min in the dark at
    room temperature.', Sodium phosphate buffer  was added to the reduced extracts
    to a final volume of 500 L. The samples were analyzed using an Agilent 1100 series
    HPLC system  equipped with a Chromolite Performance RP-18e column  from Merck.,
  'The solvent consisted of 2.5 mM Na2H2PO4H2O, 2.5 mM n-dodecyltrimethylammonium
    chloride, 1.25 mM disodiumEDTA in water, and 2%  acetonitrile.', 'The column temperature
    was 25 C, and the flow rate was 1 mL/min.', 'The injection volume was 10 L, and
    the run time was set to 10 min.', l-Ascorbic acid was measured at 264 nm and quantified
    with the use of external standard  in the concentration range 510 g/mL., The concentration
    of DHAA was calculated by subtracting the AA concentration from the total AA content
    determined after reduction of the DHAA present., The content of ascorbic acids
    was expressed as milligrams of ascorbic acid per 100 g fresh weight of kale.,
  All extracts were analyzed in duplicate., 'Phenolic compounds in the methanolic
    extracts of curly kale were quantified using an Agilent 1100 series HPLC system  equipped
    with a degasser, an autosampler cooled to 4 C, a photodiode array detector, and
    an MSD XCT ion trap mass spectrometer  with an ESI interface as previously described.',
  The phenolic compounds were analyzed in both negative and positive ionization modes.,
  'Fragmentation  was carried out in the automatic mode; that is, the two most abundant
    ions in MS14 were fragmented.', 'Naturally occurring flavonols, phenolic acids,
    and anthocyanins were quantified using external standards of rutin, chlorogenic
    acid, and cyanidin-3-glucoside, respectively, in the concentration range of 5150
    g/mL.', 'The results are expressed as rutin equivalents, milligrams of RE per
    100 g fresh weight of kale, chlorogenic acid equivalents, milligrams of CAE per
    100 g fresh weight of kale, and cyanidin-3-glucoside equivalents, milligrams of
    CGE per 100 g fresh weight of kale, respectively.', The glucosinolate analysis
    of the methanolic extracts of curly kale was determined as previously described.,
  'The curly kale extract was divided into two portions; one portion  of the extract
    was mixed with 20 L of sinigrin  used as an internal standard, and the other portion  was
    kept intact.', 'Both samples  were applied on in-house-prepared DEAE Sephadex
    A25 columns, washed with 1 mL of water and 1 mL of 0.02 M sodium acetate.', Purified
    sulfatase solution  was added to the column and left overnight., The desulfoglucosinolates
    were eluted with 1.25 mL of water., The separation and detection were performed
    on an Agilent 1100 series HPLC system equipped with a DAD and a single-quadrupole
    mass spectrometer with an APCI interface  using a Spherisorb ODS2 RP-C18 column  with
    a matching guard column  from Waters., 'The column temperature was set to 30 C,
    and the injection volume was 20 L. Solvent A consisted of 0.1% formic acid in
    water, and solvent B consisted of 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile.', 'The elution
    gradient used was 5% B in 2 min, 535% B in 8 min, 3540% B in 5 min, 4050% B in
    1 min, 50% B in 4 min, 50100% B in 0.5 min, and 4.5 min 100% B, with a flow rate
    of 1 mL/min.', The column was allowed to equilibrate for 10 min with 5% B between
    the injections., Detection was carried out at 229 nm by the DAD and also by the
    single-quadrupole mass spectrometer., 'The mass spectrometer was used in positive
    ionization mode, with a nebulizer pressure of 60 psi, a flow rate of nitrogen
    dry gas of 13 L/min, a dry temperature of 350 C, a capillary voltage of 4 kV,
    and a corona ampere of 4 A.', Analysis was carried out using a scan from m/z 50
    to m/z 1000\., The quadropole was used to facilitate the identification of the
    GLS based on the parent and fragmented ions., Quantifications were done by using
    absorbance at 229 nm by comparison with the internal standard  peak area ratio
    and with relative response factors for each of the glucosinolates., The results
    are reported as milligrams of GLS per 100 g fresh weight of kale., 'The analysis
    of isothiocyanates started with a cyclocondensation reaction between 1,2-benzenedithiole
    and the isothiocyanates present in the extracts.', 'Curly kale extract, 0.096
    M sodium tetraborate buffer, and 20 mM 1,2-benzenedithiole  were mixed and incubated
    in a shaking water bath for 2 h at 65 C. After incubation, the sample was centrifuged
    for 10 min at 13000 rpm and 4 C, and the supernatant was ready for analysis.',
  The analysis was carried out on an Agilent 1100 series HPLC system equipped with
    a DAD., 'Chromatographic separation was performed on an analytical Luna RP-C18
    column  from Phenomenex Inc., with isocratic elution in 20 min with 20% solvent
    A consisting of 0.1% formic acid in water and 80% solvent B consisting of 0.1%
    formic acid in 80% acetonitrile.', 'The column temperature was held at 40 C, the
    injection volume was 100 L, and the solvent flow rate was 0.3 mL/min.', 'The isothiocyanates
    were quantified by an external standard of 1,3-benzodithiole-2-thione  at 365
    nm, and the concentration was expressed as micrograms of isothiocyanates per 100
    g fresh weight of kale.', 'The human colon cancer cells lines Caco-2, HT-29, and
    HCT 116 were originally obtained from the American Type Culture Collection.',
  'Caco-2 and HT-29 cells were grown in DMEM medium supplemented with 20% and 10%
    FCS, respectively, 1% nonessential amino acids, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 g/mL
    streptomycin.', 'HCT 116 cells were grown in McCoys 5A medium containing 10% fetal
    calf serum, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 mg/mL streptomycin.', All cell lines
    were maintained at 37 C and 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator., 'The Caco-2, HT-29,
    and HCT 116 cell lines were plated in 96-well plates at densities of 1.6  105,
    1.9  105, and 1.6  105 cells/mL, respectively, in growth medium and incubated
    for 24 h. The growth medium in each well was then replaced with medium containing
    curly kale extracts with different concentrations of total phenolics  or extracts
    containing different concentrations of curly kale.', Triplets of each concentration
    were added to three plates., 'Cell proliferation was determined using the colorimetric
    MTT assay, which measures the ability of metabolically active cells to cleave
    tetrazolium sodium salt to purple formazan crystal.', The resulting purple precipitate
    in the cells was dissolved in 120 L of 2-propanol containing 0.04 M HCl and the
    absorbance measured at 562 nm using a Titertek Multiscan Plus MK II plate reader.,
  'Quercetin, a flavonol known to have antiproliferative activity in colon cancer
    cells, was used as a positive control.', The MTT experiments were repeated three
    independent times., The HT-29 and Caco-2 cell lines were screened for apoptosis
    using the Apo-ONE homogeneous caspase-3/7 assay., 'Active caspase enzymes cleave
    the substrate rhodamine 110, Z-DEVD-R110), which causes a release of the luminescent
    rhodamine 110 group.', The amount of luminescence is proportional to the amount
    of caspase-3 and -7 present in the cells., A high content of these enzymes indicates
    an activated apoptotic process., The HT-29 and Caco-2 cells were seeded out in
    white 96-well plates., 'After 24 h, the cells were exposed to curly kale extracts
    with different concentrations of total phenolics, in parallel, and incubated for
    4 h at 37 C and 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator.', 'Following the incubation,
    the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and 100 L of fresh growth
    medium and 100 L of Caspase-Glo 3/7 reagent were added and the contents carefully
    mixed.', The plate was then incubated for 1 h at room temperature before the generated
    signals were measured by the Glomax 96 microplate luminometer  using the conditions
    set by the manufacturer., 'Staurosporine, known to induce apoptosis in colon cancer
    cells, was included as a positive control.', The experiments were repeated three
    independent times., The data from the chemical analysis and cell experiments were
    analyzed with one-way ANOVA using the statistical program MINITAB 16., Significant
    differences  between average responses were evaluated using Tukeys comparison
    test., Curly kale is representative of vegetables with a high level and broad
    spectrum of phytochemicals with potential positive health effects in humans.,
  'In the present study, the antiproliferative effects of both fresh and heat-processed
    green and red curly kale cultivars were investigated.', Thermal processing using
    the boil-in-bag principle was chosen in this study as it represents a promising
    thermal processing method for the food industry with an expected minimum physical
    loss of phytochemicals compared to boiling in water., 'Extracts of fresh and processed
    curly kale used in the cellular response experiments were determined for their
    antioxidant capacity as well as characterized and quantified for their contents
    of specific methanol/water-soluble phytochemicals with potential cellular bioactivity,
    that is, vitamin C, phenolic compounds, glucosinolates, and isothiocyanates.',
  'TP in the methanolic extracts was determined in a colorimetric assay where the
    FolinCiocalteu reagent reacts with any reducing substances in the sample and gives
    the total reducing capacity, i.e., antioxidant capacity, of the sample.', 'The
    TP content of the fresh green cultivar was 424 mg of GAE/100 g fw, which is of
    the same order of magnitude as previously reported.', 'Processing of the kale
    reduced the TP content by 40%, resulting in an average TP content of 249 mg of
    GAE/100 g fw in the green cultivar.', 'The TP content in the fresh leaves of the
    red cultivar of curly kale was 562 mg of GAE/100 g fw, which is in the same range
    as found by Olsen et al.', 'During heat processing, the TP content in the red
    leaves was reduced by 20%, giving an average TP content in the methanolic extracts
    of 435 mg of GAE/100 g fw.', The heat-processed red curly kale thus comprised
    the same total phenolics content as the fresh green kale cultivar., Table 1.,

    from a pooled curly kale sample from five plants   standard deviation., The results
    are from analyses of three extracts of each of three heat treatments   standard
    deviation., 'Analyzed by HPLC, sum of L-ascorbic acid and L-dehydroascorbic acid,
    expressed as mg of ascorbic acid/100 g fw.', TMA in the red cultivar of curly
    kale was measured by the means of the inherent pH-dependent color characteristics.,
  The TMA content in the fresh leaves of red curly kale was 120 mg of CGE/100 g fw.,
  'In the processed material, the TMA level was reduced by 40% to 74 mg of CGE/100
    g fw.', The TMA level found in fresh leaves of red curly kale was of the same
    order of magnitude as previously reported in other fresh red-colored B. oleracea
    species., The antioxidant capacity was determined by the FRAP assay where the
    samples ability to reduce a ferric complex  to a blue-colored ferrous product  at
    low pH is measured., 'In the fresh green kale the average FRAP value was 5.1 mmol
    of Fe/100 g fw, which is higher compared to the previously reported results of
    2.34 mmol of Fe/100 g of curly kale determined by Halvorsen et al.', This could
    be due to the longer reaction times used in the assay in this study., 'Processed
    green curly kale had an FRAP value of 3.1 mmol of Fe/100 g fw, which corresponds
    to a 40% decrease in antioxidant capacity.', The FRAP value of the fresh red cultivar
    of curly kale was 9.6 mmol of Fe/100 g fw., 'During heat processing, the FRAP
    value decreased by 23%, resulting in an FRAP value of 7.4 mmol of Fe/100 g fw.',
  The FRAP value and the total phenolics gave similar percentage reduction after processing
    of the kale., 'Vitamin C, comprising l-ascorbic acid and l-dehydroascorbic acid,
    is a water-soluble compound found in large quantity in curly kale.', 'The content
    of vitamin C in the investigated green cultivar was 52 and 28 mg of AA/100 g fw
    for the fresh and processed curly kale, respectively, which corresponded to a
    45% decrease in the vitamin C content after processing.', 'In the red cultivar
    the vitamin C content was 67 and 51 mg of AA/100 g fw for the fresh and processed
    curly kale, respectively, which corresponded to a 25% decrease in the vitamin
    C content.', 'The concentration of vitamin C in the present study was lower than
    previously reported in curly kale,  probably because the method used for extraction
    of phytochemicals was not optimized for extraction of vitamin C. However, it appears
    that the observed reductions in vitamin C content in both cultivars corresponds
    well with the decrease in TP content and FRAP value in both green and red cultivars.',
  'The average dry matter content in leaves of curly kale, shown in Table 1, was reduced
    in the thermally treated kale, from 18.2% to 14.7% in the green cultivar and from
    16.7% to 15.5% in the red cultivar.', 'This corresponds to 20% and 7% decrease
    in dry matter content in the green and red cultivars, respectively.', The increase
    in water content  was most likely due to the blanching step where the kale was
    immersed in boiling water., 'Increased moisture content during blanching has been
    reported previously and is postulated to be due to absorption of water into damaged
    cells, and leakage of dry matter into the water will also increase the moisture
    content in the vegetable.', 'Considering the decrease in dry matter content after
    thermal processing, the reduction of TP, FRAP, and vitamin C on a dry weight basis
    was 30% and 17% in the green and red cultivars, respectively.', 'Two main classes
    of phenolic compounds, i.e., flavonoids and phenolic acids, have previously been
    identified in extracts of fresh curly kale.', 'In this study the same extraction
    procedure as previously used was applied on both fresh and processed kale leaves,
    and the same phenolic compounds were identified in the methanolic extracts.',
  The identification and concentrations of the individual phenolic compounds are summarized
    in the Supporting Information., 'In the methanolic extracts of the green and red
    cultivars of curly kale, kaempferol and quercetin derivatives, occurring as mono-,
    di-, tri-, tetra-, and pentaglycosides, several of them acylated with different
    hydroxycinnamic acids, were identified.', A total of 27 individual flavonols were
    identified and quantified., 'The total concentration of flavonols, determined
    as the sum of individual flavonols in fresh leaves from the green cultivar, was
    705 mg of RE/100 g fw, which is in accordance with the previous finding of 646
    mg of GAE/100 g fw.', 'The total content of flavonols in the processed green curly
    kale was 390 mg of RE/100 g fw, which corresponds to a 45% decrease in the flavonol
    content.', 'In leaves of fresh material of the red cultivar, the flavonol content
    was 388 mg of RE/100 g fw, which is in accordance with previous findings of 425
    mg of RE/100 g fw in kale from 2007 to 2009.', 'Heat processing of the red cultivar
    gave a surprisingly low reduction in the flavonol content to 329 mg of RE/100
    g fw, corresponding to a 15% decrease.', Table 2., "Concentration of the Flavonols,

  'Eight hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives, one benzoic acid derivative, and one compound
    containing both groups were identified and quantified in methanolic extracts of
    curly kale.', 'The native phenolic acids were individually quantified as CAE at
    330 nm, and the total concentration is summarized in Table 2.', The total concentration
    in the fresh green cultivar of curly kale was 166 mg of CAE/100 g fw., 'In the
    processed green curly kale material, the total phenolic acid content was 64 mg
    of CAE/100 g fw, which corresponds to a 60% reduction in phenolic acid content.',
  'The total content of phenolic acids in the red cultivar was 102 mg of CAE/100 g
    fw and 74 mg of CAE/100 g fw of fresh and processed plant material, respectively,
    corresponding to a 27% reduction.', In the red cultivar of curly kale a total
    of 12 anthocyanins were identified and quantified., The anthocyanins found were
    mainly cyanidin-3-diglucoside-5-glucoside derivatives acylated with different
    hydroxycinnamic acids at the diglucosyl moiety in the 3-position., 'The total
    content of cyanidin derivatives in fresh red cultivar was 263 mg of CGE/100 g
    fw, which is in accordance with the previous finding.', Processing reduced the
    concentration by 50% to 137 mg of CGE/100 g fw., 'The total phenolic content calculated
    as the sum of all identified compounds in the green cultivar of curly kale was
    871 and 454 mg of phenolic equiv/100 g fw in the fresh and the processed material,
    respectively, i.e., a 48% reduction in total phenolic compounds.', 'In the fresh
    red cultivar of curly kale, the concentration of total phenolics quantified by
    HPLC and calculated as the sum of individual compounds was 753 mg of phenolic
    equiv/100 g fw, which corresponds to the previous finding in the red cultivar
    of curly kale, i.e., 872 mg of phenolic equiv/100 g fw.', 'The concentration in
    processed red kale leaves was 540 mg of phenolic equiv/100 g, which is a total
    reduction of phenolic compounds of 28%.', A total of seven individual glucosinolates
    were identified and quantified in methanolic extracts of curly kale after desulfation.,
  Glucobrassicin  was the major glucosinolate followed by glucoiberin  and neoglucobrassicin  in
    both the green and red cultivars., 'In the fresh green cultivar, the total glucosinolate
    concentration was 164.7 mg/100 g fw.', 'In the processed green cultivar, the total
    glucosinolate concentration was 100.6 mg/100 g fw, corresponding to a 40% reduction
    in glucosinolate content.', 'In the red cultivar of curly kale, the reduction
    after heat processing was only 15%, with a total glucosinolate concentration in
    fresh material of 78.6 mg/100 g fw and in processed material 68.5 mg/100 g fw.',
  The glucosinolate contents detected in the two cultivars of curly kale were in the
    same range as reported previously., 'Breakdown products of glucosinolates include
    isothiocyanates, which are produced following exposure to the endogenous plant
    enzyme myrosinase.', 'However, heat treatment may also affect the breakdown of
    glucosinolates.', 'Small amounts of isothiocyanates were detected, 3.64.4 g/100
    g fw, with no significant differences in isothiocyanate content between the extracts
    of fresh and processed green and red cultivars of curly kale.', 'Statistical evaluation
    showed that there were significant differences between fresh and processed green
    kale in TP content, FRAP value, vitamin C content, dry matter content, and composition
    of phenolic compounds and glucosinolates.', 'In the red cultivar a significant
    differences in TP content, TMA content, FRAP value, dry matter content, and composition
    of phenolic compounds, but not vitamin C and glucosinolate content, were observed
    between the fresh and processed material.', 'Overall, the red cultivar was more
    resistant to losses of phytochemicals than the green cultivar, which might be
    due to a firmer and waxier epidermal surface of the red kale leaves compared to
    the leaves of the green cultivar.', 'Antiproliferative Effects on Colon Cancer
    Cells of Fresh and Heat-Treated Green and Red Curly Kale


    Human colon cancer development is often characterized in an early stage by hyperproliferation
    of the epithelium leading to the formation of adenomas.', This is mainly a consequence
    of dysregulated cell cycle control and suppressed apoptosis., Protective effects
    against colon cancer development should consequently be associated with inhibition
    of cell proliferation and/or induction of the apoptotic pathway to delete cells
    carrying mutations and to maintain a normal cell population., 'The antiproliferative
    effects of extracts of fresh and processed curly kale of the two cultivars were
    determined in preconfluent Caco-2, HT-29, and HCT 116 cells after 24 h of exposure
    to extracts of curly kale in the TP concentration range of 10150 mg of GAE/L and
    with FRAP values of 0.13.1 mmol of Fe/L.', 'Interestingly, a significantly stronger
    inhibition of cell proliferation was observed with extracts from fresh plant material
    than from processed plant material.', This was especially prominent with the HT-29
    cell line where processed curly kale extracts showed no antiproliferative effects.,
  'Furthermore, there was no significant difference between the antiproliferative
    effects of fresh green and red curly kale extracts, while processed red curly
    kale extract had a significantly less antiproliferative effect than processed
    green curly kale extract.', 'Thus, the antiproliferative activity of the curly
    kale extracts could not alone be explained by the TP content in the extracts or
    by the antioxidant capacity of the extracts calculated as FRAP.', Figure 1., 'Effects
    on cell proliferation  of curly kale extracts from the  green cultivar and  red
    cultivar on Caco-2, HT-29, and HCT 116 cells.', The cells were exposed to different
    TP concentrations  of curly kale extracts in cell culture medium for 24 h before
    cell proliferation was measured at 562 nm., Data are expressed as absorbance  of
    cells treated with extracts normalized to the control., The graphs represent the
    results of a typical experiment., 'Different letters indicate significant differences,
    calculated by Tukeys comparison test, between fresh and processed kale of the
    green and red cultivars in one cell line.', 'To investigate which compounds influenced
    the antiproliferative effects of the curly kale extracts, the colon cancer cell
    lines were exposed to extracts containing increasing concentrations of curly kale
    leaf material, 10, 20, 40, and 60 g fw of kale/L.', 'The results are summarized
    in Figure 2, which also contains information about the TP concentration and content
    of phenolic compounds, glucosinolates, and vitamin C determined in the actual
    extracts presented for the colon cancer cell lines.', 'Again, a significantly
    higher inhibition of cell proliferation following incubation with fresh curly
    kale than with processed plant material was observed, and there were no detectable
    antiproliferative effects on the HT-29 cells following incubation with processed
    green and red cultivars of curly kale.', 'Interestingly, the amount of phenolic
    compounds, glucosinolates, and vitamin C in 20 g fw of kale/L of fresh green curly
    kale was almost equal to the amount found in extracts of 40 g fw of kale/L of
    processed green curly kale.', 'However, the antiproliferative effects of extracts
    containing 20 g fw of kale/L of fresh green curly kale on Caco-2, HT-29, and HCT
    116 were still 2-, 5-, and 2.5-fold higher, respectively, than those of extracts
    containing 40 g fw of kale/L of processed green curly kale.', 'Furthermore, there
    was no significant difference between the antiproliferative effects of green and
    red curly kale extracts, although red curly kale extracts contained about 20%
    less phenolic compounds, 3050% less glucosinolates, and 2040% more vitamin C than
    the green cultivar.', 'This indicates that the specific composition of compounds
    in an extract may be vital for the inhibitory effects on cell proliferation or
    that there are compounds not detected in the extracts which are degraded during
    thermal processing, which have antiproliferative effects on the cell lines.',
  There is growing evidence that the antiproliferative capacity may arrive from the
    synergy between different compounds and compound groups., 'Accordingly, Brandi
    et al.', reported antiproliferative properties of B. oleracea juice in human cancer
    cell lines., 'Also, Gorinstein et al.', studied methanolic extracts of white cabbage
    and reported antioxidant and antiproliferative activities in human cancer cell
    lines., Figure 2., 'Effects on cell proliferation  of curly kale extracts from
    the  green cultivar and  red cultivar on Caco-2, HT-29, and HCT 116 cells.', The
    cells were incubated with increasing amounts of curly kale extracts  in cell culture
    medium for 24 h before cell proliferation was measured at 562 nm., Data are expressed
    as absorbance  of cells treated with extracts normalized to the control., The
    graphs represent the results of a typical experiment., 'Different letters indicate
    significant differences, calculated by Tukeys comparison test, between fresh and
    processed kale of the green and red cultivars in one cell line.', The induction
    of apoptosis of curly kale extracts  was evaluated with the HT-29 cell line to
    ascertain whether the observed reduction in cell proliferation was due to induction
    of apoptosis., Increased concentrations of fresh green and red curly kale gave
    a significantly increased induction of apoptosis in HT-29 cells., 'At the highest
    concentration tested, both green and red cultivars induced about 70% more apoptosis
    than untreated controls.', 'However, increasing concentration of processed green
    and red curly kale extracts did not show any effect on apoptosis on HT-29 cells,
    which is in accordance with the results of cell proliferation.', Similar results
    were obtained with the Caco-2 cell line., These results indicate that the reduced
    cell proliferation observed in the colon cancer cell lines was due to induced
    apoptosis., Figure 3., Effects on apoptosis of curly kale extracts on HT-29 cells.,
  'The cells were exposed to curly kale extracts of different TP concentrations  in
    cell culture medium for 4 h before measurement of the activity of caspase enzymes
    which cleave rhodamine 110, causing a release of the luminescent rhodamine 110
    group, which indicates an activated apoptotic process.', Data are expressed as
    absorbance  of cells treated with extracts normalized to the control., The graphs
    represent the results of a typical experiment., 'Different letters indicate significant
    differences, calculated by Tukeys comparison test, between fresh and processed
    kale of the green and red cultivars in one cell line.', 'In conclusion, our study
    showed that heat processing significantly reduced the concentration of phytochemicals
    and antioxidant parameters in green and red cultivars of curly kale and that the
    processing affected the two kale cultivars differently, with a greater loss of
    health-related phytochemicals in the green cultivar compared to the red kale cultivar.',
  'Furthermore, both green and red curly kale cultivars inhibited cell proliferation
    and induced apoptosis in colon cancer cells.', 'Interestingly, the fresh curly
    kale extracts had a higher antiproliferative effect than the extracts from processed
    curly kale.', 'To summarize, this study provides preliminary data about the ability
    of curly kale extracts to inhibit growth and induce apoptosis of different colon
    cancer cells in vitro.', Further studies are required to clarify the link between
    results obtained in cell culture studies and the impact on human health before
    it can be determined that curly kale intake can affect colon cancer., Tables 35
