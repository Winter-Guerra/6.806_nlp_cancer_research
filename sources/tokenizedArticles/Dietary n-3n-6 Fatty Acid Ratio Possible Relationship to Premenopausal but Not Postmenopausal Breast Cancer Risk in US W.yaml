text: [Recent research has suggested that an increased  fatty acid intake and/or increased
    / polyunsaturated fatty acid  ratio in the diet is associated with a lower breast
    cancer risk., This case-control study investigated the association between intake
    of  and other fatty acids and the / PUFA ratio and breast cancer risk., 'After
    combining data from two related case-control studies in Connecticut, we had information
    available on a total of 1119 women.', 'Cases were all histologically confirmed,
    incident breast carcinoma patients.', Controls were hospital-based  and population-based.,
  Information on dietary intake was obtained through a validated food-frequency questionnaire.,
  'Standard multivariate methods were used to address the independent effects of specific
    fatty acids, fat classes and macronutrients on breast cancer risk.', 'In the full
    study population, there were no significant trends for any macronutrient/fatty
    acid when comparing the highest to the lowest quartile of intake.', 'When the
    analysis was restricted to premenopausal women, consumption of the highest compared
    with the lowest quartile of the / PUFA ratio was associated with a nonsignificant
    41% lower risk of breast cancer.', 'A higher / PUFA ratio was significantly associated
    with a lower risk of breast cancer when the data were restricted to the Tolland
    County  study site; OR = 0.50, 95% CI 0.27, 0.95, P for trend = 0.02.', 'These
    results are consistent with the hypothesis that a higher / PUFA ratio may reduce
    the risk of breast cancer, especially in premenopausal women.']
