text: [The breast is particularly vulnerable to carcinogenic influences during adolescence
    due to rapid proliferation of mammary cells and lack of terminal differentiation.,
  We investigated consumption of adolescent red meat and other protein sources in
    relation to breast cancer risk in the Nurses Health Study II cohort., 'We followed
    prospectively 44,231 women aged 33-52 years who, in 1998, completed a detailed
    questionnaire about diet during adolescence.', Relative risks  and 95% confidence
    intervals  were estimated using Cox proportional hazard regression., We documented
    1132 breast cancer cases during 13-year follow-up., 'In multivariable Cox regression
    models with major breast cancer risk factors adjustment, greater consumption of
    total red meat in adolescence was significantly associated with higher premenopausal
    breast cancer risk, but not postmenopausal breast cancer.', Adolescent intake
    of poultry was associated with lower risk of breast cancer overall., 'Adolescent
    intakes of iron, heme iron, fish, eggs, legumes and nuts were not associated with
    breast cancer.', 'Replacement of one serving/day of total red meat with one serving
    of combination of poultry, fish, legumes, and nuts was associated with a 15% lower
    risk of breast cancer overall  and a 23% lower risk of premenopausal breast cancer.',
  'In conclusion, higher consumption of red meat during adolescence was associated
    with premenopausal breast cancer.', Substituting other dietary protein sources
    for red meat in adolescent diet may decrease premenopausal breast cancer risk.,
  The relation between intake of red meat and breast cancer has been examined in many
    studies; the overall evidence from a pooled analysis of cohort studies and a recent
    meta-analysis has not supported an important association., 'However, most of this
    evidence has been based on diet during midlife and later.', 'In contrast, among
    women in Nurses Health Study II  cohort, high intake of red meat in early adulthood
    was associated with increased breast cancer incidence.', 'Furthermore, vegetable
    protein consumption at age 14 was associated with lower risk of benign breast
    disease in early adulthood.', 'Therefore, one potential explanation for the overall
    lack of association in previous studies is the timing of dietary assessment.',
  Mammary glands may be particularly vulnerable to breast carcinogenesis during childhood
    due to rapid proliferation of cells and lack of terminal differentiation., 'The
    evidence for this window of vulnerability was demonstrated in the atomic bombings
    of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and was also seen with radiation treatment for Hodgkins
    lymphoma; in both cases exposure to radiation in childhood and early adult life
    was associated with subsequent risk of breast cancer, whereas exposure after age
    30 had little effect.', 'In an early analysis of the NHSII with 7 years follow-up
    and with 455 incident invasive breast cancer cases, intake of total red meat  during
    adolescence was associated with an increased risk of premenopausal breast cancer.',
  'This updated analysis provided an examination of animal and vegetable sources of
    protein during adolescence including intakes of total red meat, poultry, fish,
    eggs, legumes and nuts in relation to breast cancer incidence with almost triple
    the number of cases and twice the length of follow-up.', 'In addition, we were
    able to examine breast cancers separately by menopausal status and estrogen receptor  and
    progesterone receptor  status.', 'In 1989, the NHSII cohort was established with
    a total 116,430 female registered nurses aged 24-43 years who completed biennial
    questionnaires including items on lifestyle and medical events.', 'In 1997, participants
    were asked whether they would fill out a supplemental food frequency questionnaire  about
    diet during high school.', '64,380 women  indicated willingness to complete, and
    47,355 of them returned the HS-FFQ in 1998.', 'Participants were excluded if they
    had any cancer except nonmelanoma skin cancer before 1998, had missing information
    on age or red meat intake or reported implausible daily energy intake.', 'After
    exclusions, data from 44,231 women were available for the present analysis.',
  The follow-up completed was greater than 98% of potential person-years through 2011.,
  The study protocol was approved by the institutional review boards of Brigham and
    Womens Hospital and Harvard School of Public Health., Adolescent food intake was
    measured using the 124-item FFQ which was specifically designed to include foods
    that were usually consumed between 1960 and 1980 when the participants would have
    been in high school., 'Categories on the HS-FFQ included main dishes, bread and
    cereals, fruits, vegetables, condiments, snack foods, dairy products and beverages.',
  'Total red meat intake included unprocessed red meat  and processed red meat items
    ; poultry included chicken and turkey; fish included tuna, dark meat fish, and
    other fish; legumes included beans, peas, lentils, and lima beans; and nuts included
    peanuts, peanut butter, other nuts and seeds.', 'For each food, a commonly used
    portion size was indicated, and participants were asked for their dietary habits
    when they were in high school.', Nine categories of frequency were possible ranging
    from never or less than once per month to 6 or more per day., The validity and
    reproducibility of the HS-FFQ was described in detail elsewhere., 'Briefly, the
    reproducibility of the HS-FFQ was examined among 80 young adults by comparing
    their responses on the HS-FFQ with information they provided using a similar questionnaire
    10 years earlier about their current diet while they were in high school.', The
    mean of correlation between the two measures administered 10 years apart was 0.58.,
  'In the same group, the mean correlation for nutrients assessed by the HS-FFQ and
    by three 24-hour recalls while in high school was 0.45.', 'Furthermore, the reproducibility
    of HS-FFQ was administered twice at a 4-year interval to a random sample of 333
    NHSII participants; the correlation for adolescent nutrient intakes reported 4
    years earlier was 0.65  and red meat consumed within main dishes had a mean correlation
    of 0.52, whereas the correlation between adult and adolescent diet was weak, indicated
    that this is largely independent information.', Validity was also assessed by
    comparing dietary intake reported by 272 mothers of the NHSII participants with
    adolescent diets using the HS-FFQ; the correlation was 0.40  for nutrients., 'To
    assess dietary intake during adulthood, women were asked to complete a semiquantitative
    FFQ with approximately 130 items about usual diet and alcohol consumptions during
    the past year in 1991 and every 4 years afterwards.', Food items included in this
    FFQ and response categories were similar to those on the HS-FFQ., Nutrient intakes
    for both the HS-FFQ and adult FFQ were calculated by multiplying the frequency
    of consumption by the nutrient content of the specified portions of each unit
    of food or beverage and summing across all items., 'The US Department of Agriculture,
    food manufacturers, and independent academic sources were used to calculate the
    nutrient values in foods, using values specific to 1960 to 1980 for the HS-FFQ.',
  'To calculate the percentage of energy contributed by fat and other macronutrients,
    we divided energy intake from that nutrient by total energy intake.', Intakes
    of iron and heme iron were energy-adjusted by using the residuals from the regression
    of nutrient intake on total energy intake., Incident cases of breast cancer were
    ascertained on biennial follow-up questionnaires mailed between 1997 and 2011
    and by a search of the National Death Index., 'We requested permission to obtain
    medical records and pathology reports, which were used to confirm diagnose and
    to extract information on estrogen and PR status.', Deaths in this cohort were
    reported through family members and the postal service in response to the follow-up
    questionnaires or identified through annual review of the National Death Index.,
  Medical records were obtained for 88% of NHSII cases included in this analysis.,
  More than 99% of self-report breast cancers were confirmed through pathology report
    review., 'Therefore, we included self-reported cases with missing pathology report
    in the analysis.', 'Data on age, height, weight, family history of breast cancer,
    history of benign breast disease, smoking, race, menopausal status, age at menarche,
    postmenopausal hormone use and oral contraceptive use were obtained from the biennial
    NHSII questionnaires and all variables except race, height and age at menarche
    were updated to the most recent information before date of diagnosis, whenever
    available.', Menopausal status is described in detail elsewhere., 'Briefly, Women
    were defined as premenopausal if they still had menstrual periods or had hysterectomy
    with at least one ovary remaining and were younger than 46 years for smokers or
    younger than 48 years for nonsmokers.', Women were defined as postmenopausal if
    they reported permanent cessation of menstrual periods or had bilateral oophorectomy
    surgery., Women who had unknown menopausal status or had hysterectomy without
    bilateral oophorectomy were considered postmenopausal if they were 54 years or
    older for smokers or 56 years or older for nonsmokers., Body mass index  at age
    18 was obtained from the 1989 questionnaire and used as a proxy for BMI during
    high school., Weight change from age 18 was calculated by taking the difference
    between current weight and recalled weight at age 18., 'Data on smoking, alcohol
    consumption and oral contraceptive use during adolescence were obtained from the
    1989 NHSII questionnaire.', 'We conducted the analyses in three groups: among
    all women, premenopausal women and postmenopausal women.', 'Follow-up time began
    with return of the baseline questionnaire in 1998 until either June 2011, the
    date of breast cancer diagnosis, or death, whichever came first.', 'In premenopausal
    women, we stopped follow-up when they reported postmenopausal or uncertain menopausal
    status.', 'For postmenopausal group, women started contributing person-time from
    the first 2-year cycle in which they reported postmenopausal status.', 'Cox proportional
    hazards models, stratified by age in months and 2-year follow-up cycle, were used
    to estimate relative risks  and 95% confidence intervals.', 'Multivariable models
    adjusted for race, family history of breast cancer in mother or sisters, history
    of benign breast disease, smoking, height, BMI at age 18, weight gain since age
    18, age at menarche, parity and age at first birth, oral contraceptive use, adolescent
    alcohol intake, adult alcohol intake and adolescent energy intake, and, for postmenopausal
    women, age at menopause and hormone use.', 'Among all women, we additionally adjusted
    for hormone use and menopausal status and, age at menopause.', 'In this group,
    menopausal status and postmenopausal hormone use were categorized as premenopausal,
    postmenopausal never users, postmenopausal past users, postmenopausal current
    users and unknown menopausal status.', 'Adjustment for energy provides a measure
    of dietary composition rather than absolute intake, and also provides an adjustment
    for over and under reporting.', Tests for linear trend were conducted by modeling
    the median value for each quintile and treating this as a continuous variable
    in the regression model., The time-varying covariates included in the multivariate
    analyses were updated every 2 or 4 years., We replaced missing covariate data
    with carried-forward data for continuous variables and missing indicator method
    for categorical variables., 'We estimated the effect of substituting 1 serving/day
    of poultry, fish, legumes, eggs or nuts during adolescence for one serving/day
    of total red meat during adolescence by including simultaneously these food items
    as well as low fat dairy product and high fat dairy product as continuous variables
    in the multivariable model.', 'The RR and the 95%CIs for the substitution effect
    were derived from difference between the regression coefficients, variances and
    covariance.', 'In a sensitivity analysis, to determine whether the additional
    follow-up independently supported the earlier report, the association between
    total red meat and premenopausal breast cancer was separately evaluated from 1998
    to 2005  and from 2005 to 2011.', 'To examine differential associations of total
    red meat intake with breast cancer risk by hormone receptor status, we used Cox
    proportional cause-specific hazards regression model with a duplication method
    for competing risk data.', This method permits estimation of separate associations
    of red meat for tumors that are both ER and PR positive  and both receptors negative.,
  We examined effect modification of the association between red meat and breast cancer
    risk by other measures of breast cancer risk factors., A cross-product interaction
    term between each factor and intake of red meat expressed as a continuous variable
    was included in the multivariable model., P values for tests for interactions
    were derived by using a likelihood ratio test with one degree of freedom., All
    p values and 95%CI were 2-sided and performed by using SAS version 9.3., 'During
    602,444 person-years follow-up of 44,231 women, 1,132 women were diagnosed with
    invasive breast cancer.', Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of participants
    according to quintiles of total red meat intake in adolescence., 'Compared to
    women in the lowest quintile of adolescent dietary red meat intake, those in the
    highest quintile were more likely to drink more alcohol in adolescence and adulthood,
    to be smokers and to have age at menarche less than 12 years.', They were also
    more likely to have larger BMI at age 18 and in adulthood., 'Among all women,
    intake of total red meat was weakly but significantly associated with breast cancer
    risk.', 'Among premenopausal women, higher adolescent intake of total red meat
    was associated with greater breast cancer risk.', The association between total
    red meat and premenopausal breast cancer remained similar after adjustment for
    fruits and vegetables intake  or heme iron., Adjustment for adult red meat also
    did not change the association., The association between total red meat and premenopausal
    breast cancer was apparent after adjustment for animal fat., 'Among the covariates,
    total energy intake accounted for most of the difference in RRs for red meat between
    the age-adjusted and the multivariate models.', Total energy intake itself was
    not significantly associate with either risk of breast cancer overall  or risk
    of premenopausal breast cancer., 'We also conducted an analysis for red meat intake
    per 1,000 kcal energy intake; similar results were observed.', 'In both the age-adjusted
    and multivariable analysis, intakes of total red meat in adolescence were not
    significantly associated with postmenopausal breast cancer risk.', 'When analyses
    were conducted for unprocessed and processed red meat separately, the estimates
    were similar.', Higher intake of poultry during adolescence was associated with
    lower breast cancer risk  among all women., This inverse association was not significant
    in either premenopausal women  or postmenopausal women )., 'The results were similar
    after adjustment for adolescent animal fat, fruits and vegetables or total red
    meat intakes.', 'There was no significant association between adolescent intake
    of fish, eggs legumes, or nuts and either premenopausal or postmenopausal breast
    cancer.', No clear relationship was noted across quintiles of total iron and heme
    iron intakes in adolescence and breast cancer incidence in either premenopausal
    or postmenopausal women., Replacement of one serving of total red meat for other
    sources of protein during adolescence is presented in Figure 1., 'Among all women,
    substituting one serving of poultry/day for one serving of total red meat was
    associated with a lower breast cancer risk.', The corresponding RRs  were 0.82  for
    legumes., 'Replacement of one serving/day of total red meat with one serving of
    combination of poultry, fish, legumes, and nuts was associated with an 15% lower
    risk of breast cancer.', 'Replacement of red meat with nuts, fish, or eggs was
    not associated with lower breast cancer risk overall.', 'Similar associations
    were seen in premenopausal women for replacement of one serving/day of total red
    meat with poultry, with legumes, and with combination of poultry, fish, legumes,
    and nuts.', 'However, substitution of total red meat with other major sources
    of protein was not significantly associated with lower postmenopausal breast cancer
    risk.', Figure 1\., 'Multivariable RR and 95% confidence intervals  for breast
    cancer associated with replacement of adolescent intake of total red meat with
    other sources of dietary protein  in premenopausal women, postmenopausal women
    and all women.', 'Multivariable model was stratified by age in months at start
    of follow-up and calendar year of the current questionnaire cycle and was simultaneously
    adjusted for race, family history of breast cancer in mother or sisters, history
    of benign breast disease, smoking, height, weight gain since age 18, BMI at age
    18 years, age at menarche, parity and age at first birth, oral contraceptive use,
    adolescent alcohol intake, adult alcohol intake, adolescent energy intake  and
    major protein sources, poultry, fish, eggs, legumes, nuts, low fat dairy  and
    high fat dairy ).', 'In postmenopausal women, we additionally adjusted for postmenopausal
    hormone use, age at menopause.', 'Among all women, we additionally adjusted for
    hormone use and menopausal status  and, age at menopause.', 'In the model for
    substituting combination of legumes, nuts, poultry and fish for total red meat,
    the major sources of protein were total red meat, sum of legumes, nuts, poultry
    and fish intake, eggs, low fat dairy  and high fat dairy.', Information on ER
    status was available for 87%  and PR status for 86%  of the breast cancer cases.,
  We examined the associations with breast cancers that were positive for both  and
    negative for both receptors., We did not observe significant heterogeneity between
    total red meat intake and ER/PR status in either premenopausal or postmenopausal
    breast cancer., 'When the association between total red meat and premenopausal
    breast cancer was evaluated in the two follow-up time periods, higher intake of
    total red meat during adolescence was associated with higher breast cancer risk
    in both follow-up periods.', 'We also examined whether the association between
    adolescent intakes of total red meat differed by breast cancer risk factors including
    family history of breast cancer, BMI, oral contraceptive use, history of benign
    breast disease, adolescent alcohol intake, adult alcohol intake, age at first
    birth and parity and smoking.', The association between total red meat intake
    and breast cancer risk was modified by adolescent alcohol intake for total breast
    cancer., 'In women drinking 1.5 g/day or more alcohol at age 15-17, higher intake
    of total red meat was significantly associated with higher incidence of breast
    cancer.', 'But among women with alcohol intake at age 15-17 less than 1.5 g/day,
    there was no significant association.', 'This prospective study provides further
    evidence that greater consumption of red meat during adolescence is significantly
    associated with higher premenopausal breast cancer risk, consistent with our earlier
    findings with shorter follow-up.', 'Adjusting for animal fat, fruits and vegetables,
    heme iron, or adult red meat intake did not appreciably change the association.',
  'In addition, poultry intake was associated with a lower risk of breast cancer overall.',
  'Moreover, replacement of red meat with a combination of poultry, fish, legumes
    and nuts was also associated with lower breast cancer risk.', Evidence from prospective
    studies of red meat intake and breast cancer risk is inconsistent., 'In a recent
    review and meta-analysis of prospective studies on unprocessed and processed red
    meat consumption and breast cancer risk, red meat intake was not independently
    associated with breast cancer incidence, but these studies focused on adult dietary
    intake.', 'In contrast, a few studies have provided some evidence that diet during
    adolescent may affect the risk of adult breast cancer.', 'In a population-base
    case-control study, higher consumption of high fat red meat during adolescence
    was associated with higher breast cancer risk before age 45.29 Our finding is
    consistence with the case-control study and the previous analyses of adolescent
    and early adult red meat intake and risk of breast cancer in NHSII.', Several
    biological mechanisms may explain the association between high intake of red meat
    and breast cancer., 'Carcinogenic by-products, such as heterocyclic amines and
    polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, created during high-temperature cooking of meat
    may contribute to breast cancer.', Heterocyclic amines have estrogenic activity
    and their breast tissue-specific carcinogenic activity has been reported., 'Although
    a positive association between animal fat consumption in early adulthood and breast
    cancer was seen in a recent analysis of this cohort, the association with red
    meat intake in adolescence that we observed appeared to be independent of animal
    fat intake during adolescence.', Heme iron from meat has also been implicated
    in the etiology of breast cancer., 'However, heme iron intake was not associated
    with breast cancer risk in this analysis, and the associations for red meat and
    premenopausal and total breast cancer remained significant after adjustment for
    heme iron.', Residues of the exogenous hormones used for growth stimulation in
    beef cattle and dietary nitrosamines mainly found in processed meat may play a
    role in the etiology of breast cancer., The significant interaction that we noted
    between adolescent red meat intake and alcohol intake at age 15-17 may be due
    to chance and this needs to be confirmed in additional studies., Most previous
    studies found no association of poultry intake with breast cancer risk., 'However,
    these studies focused on dietary intake in midlife and later.', 'In agreement
    with our finding, a case-control study has reported an inverse association with
    poultry intake.', We also found an inverse association between early adulthood
    poultry intake and breast cancer risk in NHSII., 'Poultry contains higher amounts
    of polyunsaturated fat than red meat, and processing and cooking methods for poultry
    likely differ from red meat.', It is also possible that poultry consumers had
    a healthy diet and the inverse association between poultry and breast cancer may
    be explained by residual confounding., 'However, there was only a weak association
    between red meat and poultry intake during adolescence  and adjustment additionally
    for fruit and vegetable intakes or red meat did not attenuate the associations.',
  Anticarcinogenic effects of beans have been shown in animal models and might contribute
    to the lower breast cancer risk that we observed with replacement of red meat
    with legumes., 'Reductions in insulin, insulin-like growth factor and C-reactive
    protein, or alterations in lipid metabolism could also contribute to this lower
    risk.', Soy isoflavones consumption has been inversely associated with breast
    cancer incidence., 'However, intake of soy products in our cohort was too low
    for us to investigate.', One limitation of this study is the measurement of adolescent
    diet., 'In our study, the adolescent dietary intake was reported when women were
    33-52 years of age.', 'However, the observed association was independent of adult
    diet, and comparison with maternal reports provides some evidence of validity.',
  We examined incident cases and only included breast cancer diagnosed after 1998;
    our study only addresses the association for breast cancer onset after Age 33.,
  Residual confounders are always of concern in any observational studies., 'Although
    we adjusted for a wide range of potential confounders for breast cancer, we still
    could not rule out the possibility that other unmeasured or inadequately measured
    factors have influenced our findings.', 'Furthermore, the NHSII cohort is predominantly
    white, limiting the ability to study the meat consumption and breast cancer associations
    in other races; however, it is unlikely that the biology underlying this association
    differs by race.', 'Major strengths of this study include the large number of
    cases, length of follow-up and the ability to examine subtypes of breast cancers.',
  'The detailed prospective and updated assessments of diet and lifestyle factors
    afforded the most comprehensive adjustment of many potential confounders, including
    adult dietary intake.', 'In conclusion, we found that higher consumption of red
    meat during adolescence was associated with elevated rates of premenopausal breast
    cancer, but not postmenopausal breast cancer.', 'In addition, poultry intake was
    associated with a lower risk of breast cancer overall.', 'Replacement of red meat
    with combination of poultry, fish, legumes and nuts in adolescence may help to
    reduce the breast cancer risk, especially during the premenopausal years.', 'As
    the data on diet and breast cancer during childhood remain limited, further investigation
    is needed to better understand the impact of timing of dietary exposures and cancer
    risk.', 'The study sponsors were not involved in the study design and collection,
