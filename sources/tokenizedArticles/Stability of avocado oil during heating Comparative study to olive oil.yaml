text: ['The stability of the saponifiable and unsaponifiable fractions of avocado
    oil, under a drastic heating treatment, was studied and compared to that of olive
    oil.', Avocado and olive oil were characterised and compared at time 0 h and after
    different times of heating process., PUFA/SFA  and -6/-3  were higher in avocado
    oil than in olive oil during the whole experiment., Avocado oil was richer than
    olive oil in total phytosterols at time 0 h  and at 9 h  of heating., 'TBARs was
    higher in olive oil after 3 h, reaching the maximum values in both oils at 6 h
    of heating treatment.', Vitamin E was higher in olive oil  and it disappeared
    earlier in avocado oil., The stability of avocado oil was similar to that of olive
    oil.]
