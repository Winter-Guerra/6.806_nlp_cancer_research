text: ['The present study assayed the antimutagenic potential of Salvia officinalis  in
    the form of tea infusion, by the somatic mutation and recombination test  on Drosophila
    melanogaster.', 'The use of herbal infusions is much common in the human diet,
    so the aim of the present study was to estimate the antimutagenic effects of the
    S. officinalis tea rather than essential oils.', Methyl methanesulphonate  was
    used as the mutagen and positive control., 'Several types of treatment were performed:
    short acute treatment with sage infusion or MMS, longer  treatment with sage solution
    or MMS, and two combined treatments, i.e.', short treatment with sage followed
    by a longer treatment with MMS and vice versa., 'Sage infusion used in our experiments
    showed a clear antimutagenic effect, reducing the frequency of mutations induced
    by MMS.', The inhibition effect of sage tea is obtained and confirmed when pre-
    or post-treatments with mutagen were used., 'The results indicate that although
    sage in this regime decreases the number of mutation events, it is not efficient
    enough in case of the 2 h sage pre-treatment.', 'Antioxidant activity, suppression
    of metabolic activation, could be mechanisms through which sage or some of its
    components act as desmutagen.']
