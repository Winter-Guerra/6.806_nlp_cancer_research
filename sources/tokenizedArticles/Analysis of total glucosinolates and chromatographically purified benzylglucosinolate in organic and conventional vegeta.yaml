text: [The limited availability of foods that are free of pesticides has led Brazil
    to search for alternative production methods to meet the desires of consumers.,
  'Currently, organic cultivation represents a production system that complies with
    general expectations of producers and consumers.', 'Organic cultivation is particularly
    interesting mainly because of its effect on plant secondary metabolite content,
    which may help plants to naturally combat pests; in humans, these substances can
    also contribute to the prevention of chronic diseases.', 'We report on the extraction
    of glucosinolates  with trifluoroacetic acid addition in a 70:30 MeOH:water.',
  'Total glucosinolates, determined by a thioglucosidase coupled assay, were measured
    in different Brassicaceae species and were similar to values reported in the literature.',
  'For broccoli, analyses were carried out separately on inflorescences, leaves and
    stalks; analyses were also conducted on thermally processed samples to simulate
    cooking.', 'Furthermore, when the analysis was conducted on conventional and organic
    products, the highest concentrations of these substances were most often found
    in organically cultivated Brassicaceae.', The benzylglucosinolate concentrations
    were evaluated on the same samples using HPLC., 'The concentration of benzylglucosinolate
    was significantly higher in organically cultivated vegetables, as well.']
