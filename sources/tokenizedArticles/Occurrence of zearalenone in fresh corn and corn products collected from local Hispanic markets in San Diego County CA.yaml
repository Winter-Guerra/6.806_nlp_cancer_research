text: [Estrogenic mycotoxins such as zearalenone  produced by several species of Fusarium
    fungi can be found in many foods including corn and corn products., The contamination
    by the fungi can occur either in the field or during storage., Corn and corn products
    represent a significant part of Hispanic diets., Hispanic females can become exposed
    to ZON during the consumption of these products., The estrogenic property of ZON
    might promote precocious puberty in young girls and abnormal hormone balances
    in women., Corn and corn products were procured from local area Hispanic markets.,
  A single laboratory validated method was used to determine ZON in these products.,
  The limit of detection  for the method was 2.0 ng g1., 'The recovery rate of ZON
    spiked tortillas was 95%, 76% and 114%, masa was 102%, 98% and 107%, and whole
    corn was 92%, 89% and 94%, at concentrations of 5, 20, and 100 ng g1 respectively.',
  'A total of 35 corn products, collected from small family owned markets in the Spanish
    speaking areas most likely to sell products consumed by the local Hispanic population,
    were analyzed.', ZON was found in 10 of 15 tortilla samples with a mean of 1.60
    ng g1., 'Of the 9 masa samples, ZON was found in 7 samples with a mean of 4.52
    ng g1.', 'ZON was found in 4 fresh whole corn samples, averaging 0.71 ng g1.',
  The nixtamalized corn sample contained a mean level of 10.31 ng g1 ZON., ZON was
    more frequently found in the masa compared to the tortillas and fresh whole corn.]
