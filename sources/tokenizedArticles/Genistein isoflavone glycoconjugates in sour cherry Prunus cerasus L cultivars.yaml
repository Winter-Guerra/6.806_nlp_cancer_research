text: ['The isoflavone genistein on the contrary to its well-established health-beneficial
    effects is not a major component of the Western diet, since soy consumption, considered
    as the main dietary source of genistein, in these populations is low.', Genistein
    compounds in twelve commercial sour cherry  cultivars grown in Hungary were studied.,
  High performance liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionisation quadrupole/time-of-flight
    mass spectrometry  was used for screening and confirmatory analyses., 'Genistin
    and genistein were found in Pipacs1, Kantorjanosi, Debreceni bterm and va, which
    are native cultivars to Hungary.', 'Genistein content of the latter three were
    in the range of 0.4-0.6, while in Pipacs1 in total 4.4 mg genistein compounds
    were measured expressed as aglycone equivalents per 100 g of fresh fruit flesh.',
  These cultivars may play important role as complementary genistein sources in the
    Western diet., 'Especially Pipacs 1, may be best utilised in functional food products.']
