text: ['Plant protease inhibitors are a structurally highly diverse and ubiquitous
    class of small proteins, which play various roles in plant development and defense
    against pests and pathogens.', 'Particular isoforms inhibit in vitro proteases
    and other enzymes that are not their natural substrates, for example proteases
    that have roles in human diseases.', Mature potato tubers are a rich source of
    several protease inhibitor families., Different cultivars have different inhibitor
    profiles., 'With the objective to explore the functional diversity of the natural
    diversity of potato protease inhibitors, we randomly selected and sequenced 9,600
    cDNA clones originated from mature tubers of ten potato cultivars.', 'Among these,
    120 unique inhibitor cDNA clones were identified by homology searches.', Eighty-eight
    inhibitors represented novel sequence variants of known plant protease inhibitor
    families., 'Most frequent were Kunitz-type inhibitors, potato protease inhibitors
    I and II, pectin methylesterase inhibitors, metallocarboxypeptidase inhibitors
    and defensins.', Twenty-three inhibitors were functionally characterized after
    heterologous expression in the yeast Pichia pastoris., 'The purified recombinant
    proteins were tested for inhibitory activity on trypsin, eleven pharmacological
    relevant proteases and the non-proteolytic enzyme 5-lipoxygenase.', 'Members of
    the KTI and PIN families inhibited pig pancreas elastase, -Secretase, Cathepsin
    K, HIV-1 protease and potato 5-lipoxygenase.', 'Our results demonstrate in vitro
    inhibitory diversity of small potato tuber proteins commonly known as protease
    inhibitors, which might have biotechnological or medical applications.', 'The

    to authorized users.', 'Potato  Tuber Enzyme inhibitor Protease inhibitor Heterologous

    Protease inhibitors  are ubiquitous, small proteins which are particularly abundant
    in plant reproductive and storage organs such as seeds and tubers.', They account
    for 110 % of the total protein in storage tissues., 'In higher plants, several
    PI families have been characterized for their molecular structure and biochemical
    function.', The structural basis of the interaction between proteases and their
    inhibitors is under continuous investigation., PIs are involved in many physiological
    processes via control of protease activity., The best characterized example is
    their role in wound-induced defense responses of plants against herbivores and
    pathogens., They are also considered as storage proteins., 'Potato tuber protein
    consists mainly of patatin, the major storage protein, and numerous low molecular
    weight PIs which can be classified in at least ten different families.', 'Most
    abundant are inhibitors of serine proteases from families known as Kunitz-type
    inhibitors, potato protease inhibitors I and II  and BowmanBirk inhibitors.',
  KTIs are one of the best characterized inhibitors., These vacuolar proteins are
    abundant in potato tubers and represent a highly diverse group of proteins., 'Most
    KTIs are encoded at a complex locus on potato chromosome III, which is linked
    to a quantitative trait locus  for resistance to the oomycete Phytophthora infestans.',
  Most KTIs consist of a single polypeptide chain of approximately 24 kDa with two
    disulfide bridges and a single reactive site., 'Depending on the cultivar studied,
    potato KTIs were classified in three to six structural subgroups.', The tremendous
    structural variability among KTIs suggested functional diversity., Previous studies
    revealed that KTIs have distinct target specificities in vitro and some have dual
    or broad specificity., 'Inhibitors of subgroup KTI-A reduced the activity of serine
    or aspartic proteases such as trypsin or cathepsin D. Members of subgroup KTI-B
    inhibited trypsin, chymotrypsin or elastase and members of subgroup KTI-C inhibited
    not only subtilisin and cysteine proteases, but also other enzymes like invertase.',
  'Similar to KTIs, the PIN I and PIN II families display high structural and functional
    diversity, particularly in the Solanaceae, and are organized as gene clusters
    mainly on potato chromosome IX and III, respectively.', Plant PINs have been characterized
    at the biochemical and molecular level., PIN I protein was first isolated from
    potato tubers., 'More recent studies demonstrated PIN I expression in leaves,
    stems, flowers and tuber sprouts, which is regulated by both environmental and
    developmental signals.', 'Proteins homologous to PIN I are found in several plant
    species such as barley or maize, while PIN IIs seem to be restricted to the Solanaceae.',
  PIN proteins are suggested to function in plant interactions with herbivores and
    microbes., 'Digestive enzymes in the guts of herbivores were inhibited by plant
    PINs, restricting the absorption of essential amino acids and consequently interfering
    with herbivore growth and development.', 'In vitro assays confirmed inhibitory
    effects of plant PINs on the digestive serine proteases trypsin, chymotrypsin
    or subtilisin.', The detrimental effect observed on herbivores and pests led to
    the development of inhibitor-transgenic plants., 'However, due to the adaptation
    of herbivores by maintaining diverse digestive enzymes and over-expressing inhibitor
    insensitive enzymes, and last but not least due to the rejection of transgenic
    crops by the public, transgenic approaches have not been widely adopted in commercial
    food crops.', 'Beyond plant biotechnology, plant PIs became attractive targets
    in pharmacology and drug development.', 'Inhibitors of KTI and BBI families, purified
    from different leguminous seeds, were shown to block the activity of several proteases
    and enzymes involved in human diseases ).', 'Plant KTIs inhibited proteins acting
    in the blood clotting cascade or in fibrinolysis such as factor XIIa, factor Xa,
    thrombin, plasmin, plasma kallikrein or tissue plasminogen activator.', Elastase
    and cathepsin G involved in inflammatory processes in humans were shown to be
    inhibited by KTIs isolated from Bauhinia seeds., Several studies revealed anti-tumor
    activity of BBI and KTI inhibitors., Trypsin inhibitors from Peltophorum dubium  and
    soybean induced cell death of human leukemic Jurkat cell lines by activation of
    caspases 3 and 8., Inhibitors from seeds of the Chinese black soybean Glycine
    max suppressed cell proliferation of MCF-7 breast cancer cells and HepG2 hepatoma
    cells., Peptides derived from Bauhinia rufa trypsin Inhibitor  inhibited the adhesion
    of tumor cells to extracellular matrix glycoproteins., 'In summary, KTI effects
    were investigated in inflammation, thrombosis, AIDS, parasitic diseases and antifungal
    activity.', 'In this paper, we tap at the tremendous structural diversity of proteinaceous
    inhibitors found in tubers of different potato genotypes and their potential inhibitory
    functions.', 'Novel variants of KTI, PIN I, PIN II and other types of proteinaceous
    inhibitors were isolated as full length cDNAs from tubers of ten different potato
    varieties.', 'A subset was expressed as recombinant fusion proteins in the yeast
    Pichia pastoris and examined for inhibitory properties on serine, cysteine and
    aspartic proteases involved in human diseases including Alzheimer disease, AIDS
    and osteoporosis, as well as on the potato enzyme lipoxygenase.', Field grown

    inhibition., 'Both PIN II inhibitors PI4434 and PI6669 inhibited the pig pancreas
    elastase with IC50 values of 0.67 M and 0.97 M, respectively.', 'Furthermore,
    the fusion proteins were tested for inhibition of the aspartyl proteases -secretase  and
    HIV-1 protease.', Inhibitors related to KTI-B and KTI-C subfamilies were responsible
    for BACE inhibition when tested individually., 'The KTI-B inhibitors PI8234, PI2112,
    PI5887 and PI4587 and the KTI-C inhibitor PI5446 strongly inhibited BACE with
    IC50 values between 0.36 M and 0.81 M. HIV-1 protease was inhibited by the PIN
    I inhibitor PI6013 with an IC50 value of 0.67 M. The cysteine protease Cathepsin
    K was effectively inhibited by all three KTI-Cs tested  and by the PIN I inhibitor
    PI6013, which in addition inhibited the HIV-1 protease.', The KTI-C inhibitors
    with IC50 values between 0.02 and 0.09 M were more effective than the PIN I inhibitor

  "In vitro inhibition of proteases and lipoxygenase by heterologous expressed potato
    tuber protease inhibitors  \n\nSequencing 9,600 randomly selected cDNA clones
    from mature potato tuber tissue of ten cultivars yielded 175 cDNA clones coding
    for various enzyme inhibitors according to sequence similarity.", 'The overall
    transcript frequency of inhibitors was 1.8 %, which is in the same order of magnitude
    as previously observed in 1,600 cDNA clones from tubers of cultivars Provita and
    Saturna.', 'The number of inhibitors isolated from individual cultivars varied
    widely, from three in cv Elfe to thirty-one in cv Solara, indicating large variation
    of inhibitor transcript levels, which could result from genotypic differences
    or different physiological states of the tubers used for library construction.',
  Consistent with previous observations  the majority of all inhibitors slightly differed
    from sequences described in GenBank., The 120 unique nucleotide sequences matched
    to 31 loci on 10 of the 12 potato chromosomes., 'The number of coding loci could
    be smaller, as some inhibitors matched with similar high scores to more than one
    locus.', This indicates that many sequence variants were allelic., 'In particular,
    the 59 KTIs in groups A, B and C originated from only six loci, confirming the
    large allelic diversity of these genes.', 'To test whether structural variation
    is accompanied by functional diversification, we selected 29 representatives of
    various inhibitor classes for heterologous expression in the yeast P. pastoris.',
  'Twenty-three inhibitors could be expressed in soluble form and purified in sufficient
    quantity, mostly KTIs and PINs.', The recombinant proteins were evaluated for
    in vitro enzyme inhibitory functions., 'Four purified, soluble inhibitor proteins  did
    not show any biological activity, neither against trypsin, the most commonly used
    enzyme for protease inhibition assays, nor any of the other enzymes tested.',
  These proteins might have folded incorrectly or lacked components required for activity
    or their activity spectrum is completely different from the one covered in our
    study., 'The remaining nineteen proteins inhibited with different efficiency trypsin,
    the pharmacological important proteases pig pancreatic elastase, human -secretase,
    human cathepsin K, and human HIV-1 protease, and potato 5-lipoxygenase.', Trypsin
    and elastase are digestive proteases of insects that were previously shown to
    be targeted by plant PIs in the context of plant defense against herbivores.,
  'Among the tested KTIs trypsin was effectively inhibited only by group B inhibitors,
    whereas group A and C KTIs showed weak or no trypsin inhibition.', This contrasts
    a previous study  where both A and B KTIs inhibited trypsin when the fusion proteins
    were expressed in the fission yeast S. pombe., The discrepancies may be the consequence
    of the different heterologous expression systems and tags used., The KTI-A inhibitor
    constructs expressed in P. pastoris might have been non-functional due to incorrect
    protein folding or lack of disulfide bridge formation., 'In addition to trypsin,
    four of ten biologically active KTI-B proteins inhibited BACE-1, demonstrating
    functional diversity within this group of allelic sequences.', 'In agreement with
    previous functional studies  trypsin inhibition by KTIs in group C was low or
    even absent, which is likely due to a different substrate specificity.', The three
    KTIs in group C were biologically active since they all inhibited cathepsin K
    and potato 5-lipoxygenase., 'In addition, the KTI-C inhibitor PI5446 showed inhibitory
    properties on BACE-1.', This functional difference presumably reflects the sequence
    diversity within the KTI-C family., 'The KTI group C proteins inhibited most effectively
    the cysteine protease cathepsin K, suggesting cysteine proteases as their main
    targets, although they show no homology to known cysteine protease inhibitor superfamilies.',
  Further functions beyond protease inhibition are possible., 'Besides the newly identified
    inhibition of potato 5-lipoxygenase, KTI group C proteins have been found to inhibit
    in vitro soluble potato tuber invertase.', KTI-C inhibitor PI4202 is identical
    to these putative invertase inhibitors characterized previously., 'Besides the
    serine protease trypsin, the potato proteinase inhibitor I  PI6013 inhibited the
    cysteine protease cathepsin K and the aspartyl protease HIV-1.', This PIN I protein
    seems to have multiple specificities., Previous studies had revealed high inter-
    and intra-specific structural and functional diversity among the PIN I family.,
  Native PIN I proteins have been suggested to occur as hexameric protein complexes
    in which every monomer represents a functional unit., PIN I monomers interact
    with the reactive center of a protease by a constrained loop protruding from the
    surface of the molecule., Substrate specificity is supposed to be determined by
    the amino acid composition of the reactive loop., A lysine residue may interact
    with trypsin-like proteases while leucine or methionine at the same position in
    the reactive loop will bind to and inhibit proteases specific for hydrophobic
    side chains such as chymotrypsin., 'PI6013 possesses an alanine residue at the
    corresponding position in the reactive loop, which might explain the different
    substrate specificities of this inhibitor.', Two representatives from the potato
    proteinase inhibitor family II  inhibited trypsin and in addition elastase from
    pig pancreas., The activity of human leukocyte elastase was not affected., Members
    of the PIN II family are mainly found in the Solanaceae., 'Initially characterized
    in potato tubers they have been detected in leaves, flowers, fruits and phloem
    tissue of different Solanaceous species.', 'Interestingly, PPE has been used as
    model system in several pharmacological screening assays for finding human leucocyte
    elastase  inhibitors.', PIN II proteins function in planta presumably in defense
    reactions in response to the attack of herbivores and other pests., The PIN II
    proteins PI4434 and PI6669 may act on insect gut proteases as part of constitutive
    defense mechanisms against herbivores in potato tubers and other tissues., Diversity
    and abundance of plant protease inhibitors make them excellent sources for discovering
    novel enzyme inhibitors with specific pharmacological effects., 'Previous studies
    revealed several plant proteinase inhibitors acting on proteases involved in blood
    coagulation, fibrinolysis, inflammation or tumor cell proliferation.', The therapeutic
    effect of a soybean derived BowmanBirk inhibitor  in inflammatory diseases and
    cancer has been shown in several completed or ongoing human trials., 'To the best
    of our knowledge, this is the first report of plant-derived Kunitz-type inhibitors
    with inhibitory activity on BACE-1 and cathepsin K, and a PIN I protein restricting
    HIV-1 protease activity.', Human BACE-1 catalyzes the initial step in amyloidogenic
    metabolism of the large transmembrane amyloid precursor protein  leading to the
    release of the amyloid -peptide., A was identified as the main constituent of
    extracellular plaques in human brain which are characteristic for Alzheimers disease.,
  Inhibition of BACE-1 could potentially reduce the extent of amyloid plaques and
    slow down or reverse the progression of the disease., 'Hence, the design of selective
    inhibitors of BACE-1 has been the target of intensive pharmaceutical development.',
  Clinical effective BACE-1 inhibitors require high specificity and the ability to
    penetrate the bloodbrain barrier and neuronal membranes., 'The KTI-B inhibitors
    of BACE-1 in our set exhibited higher substrate specificity compared to the KTI-C
    inhibitor, which qualifies them as lead structures for further research on drug
    development.', The tested KTI-C inhibitors  were the most effective inhibitors
    of cathepsin K in our experiments., Cathepsin K is a lysosomal cysteine protease
    involved in osteoclast-mediated bone resorption., 'Inhibition of cathepsin K represents
    a potentially effective therapeutic approach for treating diseases characterized
    by excessive bone resorption, such as osteoporosis.', 'KTI-C inhibitors showed
    a broader range of biological activity than KTI-B inhibitors, since members of
    this group inhibited 5-lipoxygenase in addition to BACE-1 and Cathepsin K. Nevertheless,
    the KTI-C inhibitors present potent starting points for protein engineering with
    the aim to increase substrate specificity.', 'The same is true for the PINI inhibitor
    PI6013, which showed similar inhibitory properties on cathepsin K as well as HIV-protease,
    which is involved in virus proliferation.', The biological activity of potato
    KTIs is not limited to protease inhibition., 'Besides inhibition of invertase
    by specific members of the KTI-C family, we demonstrated in this study that three
    KTI-C recombinant proteins inhibit potato 5-lipoxygenase.', 'Plant lipoxygenases  are
    key enzymes in the biosynthesis of oxylipins, which play important roles in plant
    defense and development.', The substrates of LOX are polyunsaturated fatty acids.,
  'The 5-LOX activity converts arachidonic acid in 5-Hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid,
    an intermediate in the biosynthesis of leukotrienes and other eicosanoids.', The
    5-LOX pathway is not only relevant for plant defense  but also for inflammatory
    processes in humans leading to pathologies such as asthma and allergic reactions.,
  '5-LOX inhibitors have, therefore, been the targets of drug development.', The inhibition
    of LOX also opens up new possibilities for the in planta function of KTIs beyond
    protease inhibition., 'The new inhibitory functions discovered in this study might
    be just the tip of an iceberg, as our functional screens covered only a small
    fraction of enzymatic reactions.', Screening recombinant potato inhibitors on
    additional classes of enzymes might reveal further biological activities., 'In
    conclusion, we provide novel insights into the structural and functional diversity
    of proteinaceous inhibitors of potato tubers, which have potential for biotechnological
    applications.', 'We identified inhibitors for proteases involved in severe human
    diseases, which may be used in drug development.', Further studies of the mechanism
    of action and binding of natural inhibitors can provide leads for developing therapeutic
    agents against human diseases., The discovery of LOX inhibition by certain Kunitz-type
    inhibitors opens new possibilities for the in vivo functional role of this abundant
    class of tuber proteins., This research was carried out in the department Plant
    Breeding and Genetics headed by Maarten Koornneef., 'Funding was provided by the
