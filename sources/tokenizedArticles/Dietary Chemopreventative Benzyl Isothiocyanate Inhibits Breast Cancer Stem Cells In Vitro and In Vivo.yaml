text: ['A small subset of mammary tumor-initiating cells, characterized by expression
    of different markers, aldehyde dehydrogenase-1  activity, and ability to form
    mammospheres under ultra-low attachment culture conditions, are suspected to evade
    conventional therapies leading to disease recurrence.', Elimination of both therapy-sensitive
    epithelial tumor cells and therapy-resistant bCSC is therefore necessary for prevention
    of breast cancer., We have shown previously that a nontoxic small-molecule constituent
    of edible cruciferous vegetables  inhibits mammary cancer development in mouse
    mammary tumor virus-neu  transgenic mice by causing epithelial tumor cell apoptosis.,
  The present study shows efficacy of BITC against bCSC in vitro and in vivo., Mammosphere
    formation frequency and CD44high/CD24low/ESA+ and/or ALDH1+ populations in cultured
    MCF-7  and SUM159  human breast cancer cells were decreased significantly in the
    presence of plasma achievable concentrations of BITC., BITC administration in
    the diet  resulted in a marked decrease in bCSCs in the MMTV-neu mice tumors in
    vivo., 'Overexpression of full-length Ron as well as its truncated form, but not
    urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor, conferred near complete protection
    against BITC-mediated inhibition of bCSCs in MCF-7 cells.', The BITC treatment
    downregulated protein levels of Ron and sfRon in cultured breast cancer cells
    and in tumor xenografts., 'Ron overexpression resulted in upregulation of bCSC-associated
    genes Oct-4, SOX-2, and Nanog.', 'In conclusion, the present study indicates that
    BITC treatment eliminates bCSCs in vitro and in vivo.', Cancer Prev Res; 6; 78290.,
