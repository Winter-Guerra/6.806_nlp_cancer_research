text: ['Arachidonic acid  is a common dietary n6 cis polyunsaturated fatty acid that
    under physiological conditions is present in an esterified form in cell membrane
    phospholipids, however it might be present in the extracellular microenvironment.',
  'AA and its metabolites mediate FAK activation, adhesion and migration in MDA-MB-231
    breast cancer cells.', 'However, it remains to be investigated whether AA promotes
    invasion and the signal transduction pathways involved in migration and invasion.',
  'Here, we demonstrate that AA induces Akt2 activation and invasion in MDA-MB-231
    cells.', 'Akt2 activation requires the activity of Src, EGFR, and PIK3, whereas
    migration and invasion require Akt, PI3K, EGFR and metalloproteinases activity.',
  'Moreover, AA also induces NFB-DNA binding activity through a PI3K and Akt-dependent
    pathway.', 'Our findings demonstrate, for the first time, that Akt/PI3K and EGFR
    pathways mediate migration and invasion induced by AA in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer
    cells.']
