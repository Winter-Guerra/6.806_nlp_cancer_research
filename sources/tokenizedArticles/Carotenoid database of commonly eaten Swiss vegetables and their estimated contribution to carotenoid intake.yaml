text: [Carotenoids are plant pigments which are thought to decrease the risk of degenerative
    diseases via their antioxidant properties., 'The aim of this work was to create
    a carotenoid database for clearly identified Swiss vegetables, grown under known
    conditions and analyzed using a standardized protocol.', We determined the six
    major carotenoids in the vegetables most frequently consumed in Switzerland.,
  Chlorophyll a and b were additionally measured in green leafy vegetables., 'Lutein
    and -carotene concentrations in green leafy vegetables ranged from 0.2 to 13 mg
    and 0.2 to 8 mg/100 g fresh matter, respectively, with the highest total carotenoid
    contents in Brassicaceae.', 'Additionally, we identified strong correlations  between
    the lutein and -carotene concentrations and the total chlorophyll contents in
    different botanical families.', 'Orange and red vegetables contained a greater
    diversity of carotenoids, with - and -carotene being the predominant carotenoids
    in orange carrots and lycopene in tomatoes.', Peppers additionally contained zeaxanthin
    and -cryptoxanthin., 'Based on these data, and on the estimated consumption of
    the different vegetables in Switzerland, we estimate that 3.3 mg -carotene, 2.2
    mg lycopene and 1.8 mg lutein are consumed daily from fresh vegetables.']
