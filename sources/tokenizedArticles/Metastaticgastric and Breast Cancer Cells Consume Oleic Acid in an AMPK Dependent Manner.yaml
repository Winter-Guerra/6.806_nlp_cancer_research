text: [Gastric cancer and breast cancer have a clear tendency toward metastasis and
    invasion to the microenvironment predominantly composed of adipocytes., Oleic
    acid is an abundant monounsaturated fatty acid that releases from adipocytes and
    impinges on different energy metabolism responses., The effect and underlying
    mechanisms of oleic acid on highly metastatic cancer cells are not completely
    understood., 'We reported that AMP-activated protein kinase  was obviously activated
    in highly aggressive carcinoma cell lines treated by oleic acid, including gastric
    carcinoma HGC-27 and breast carcinoma MDA-MB-231 cell lines.', AMPK enhanced the
    rates of fatty acid oxidation and ATP production and thus significantly promoted
    cancer growth and migration under serum deprivation., Inactivation of AMPK attenuated
    these activities of oleic acid., 'Oleic acid inhibited cancer cell growth and
    survival in low metastatic carcinoma cells, such as gastric carcinoma SGC7901
    and breast carcinoma MCF-7 cell lines.', Pharmacological activation of AMPK rescued
    the cell viability by maintained ATP levels by increasing fatty acid -oxidation.,
  These results indicate that highly metastatic carcinoma cells could consume oleic
    acid to maintain malignancy in an AMPK-dependent manner., Our findings demonstrate
    the important contribution of fatty acid oxidation to cancer cell function., 'Citation:

  'Epidemiological and animal studies have demonstrated an association between fatty
    acids  or obesity and the cancer tumourigenesis and metastasis,.', 'Advanced gastric
    cancer and breast cancer have a clear tendency towards metastasis and invasion
    to the microenvironment, which is predominantly composed of adipocytes,.', Oleic
    acid is the most common monounsaturated FA in human adipocytes and other tissues
    ., Relatively little is known regarding whether highly metastatic gastric and
    breast cancer cells could adapt to the highly fatty acid culture and gain a survival/growth
    advantage by metabolic transformation to utilise oleic acid as an energy source.,
  Studies from recent decades have reported accumulating evidence of metabolic reorganisation
    during cancer development in various tumour types., One of the first biochemical
    hallmarks of cancer cells to be identified were the marked changes in metabolism.,
  'Tumour cells gain a survival/growth advantage by adapting their metabolism to respond
    to environmental stress, a process known as metabolic transformation.', The best-known
    aspect of metabolic transformation is the Warburg effect., 'Recently, several
    lines of evidence implicate fatty acid oxidation  as an important contributor
    to metabolic transformation , indicating that fatty acid metabolism might contribute
    to cancer cell function.', 'With most cancer researchers focusing on glycolysis,
    glutaminolysis and fatty acid synthesis, the relevance of fatty acid oxidation  to
    cancer cell function has not been carefully examined.', 'In particular, little
    is known regarding the biochemical pathways by which oleic acid influences tumour
    progression.', One of the fundamental requirements of all cells is the balancing
    of ATP consumption and generation., Tumour cells typically undergo metabolic transformation
    modulated by AMPK ., 'AMPK is a highly conserved sensor of cellular energy status
    that exists in the form of heterotrimeric complexes containing a catalytic -subunit
    combined with regulatory  and -subunits,.', 'In response to energy depletion,
    AMPK activation promotes metabolic changes to maintain cell proliferation and
    survival by directly phosphorylating rate-limiting enzymes in metabolic pathways,
    modifying the signal transduction cascades and gene expression.', FAO induction
    downstream from AMPK activation might be a survival or growth strategy employed
    by some cancer cells subjected to metabolic stress., 'It has been reported recently
    that omental adipocytes promote homing, migration and invasion of ovarian cancer
    cells.', 'Adipocyte-ovarian cancer cell coculture led to the direct transfer of
    lipids from adipocytes to ovarian cancer cells and promoted tumour growth, suggesting
    that there is a link in cancer cells between the adaptation to consume exogenous
    energy and the ability to migrate.', 'It is unknown whether oleic acid provides
    an energy source for other highly metastatic carcinoma cells; if so, there is
    a question regarding the basis of molecular mechanism.', It is essential to elucidate
    the molecular mechanisms by which oleic acid regulates the malignant behaviour
    of high metastatic cancer cells., 'To clarify the unknown problems, we based our
    work on the premise that assessing the influence and mechanism of oleic acid on
    cancer cells would provide a better understanding of fatty acid metabolism and
    the molecular mechanisms present in gastric and breast cancer cells.', 'Fatty
    acid-free BSA was obtained from Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., and oleic
    acid, AICAR and Compound C were purchased from Sigma.', 'The HGC-27, AGS, SGC7901,
    BGC823 human cancer cell lines were obtained from the Cell Bank of the Chinese
    Academy of Science.', The MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells were obtained from the American
    Type Culture Collection., 'The MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were maintained in DMEM
    supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated foetal calf serum, and the HGC-27, AGS,
    SGC7901 and BGC823 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FCS.',
  The cells were grown in monolayer cultures at 37C in a humidified atmosphere of
    95% air and 5% CO2., 'When BSA-bound fatty acids were added to the serum-free
    culture medium, the final concentration of BSA was adjusted to 0.5%.', 'The cells
    in 48-well plates at a density of 10,000 cells per well were treated with different
    stressors.', 'The cell viability was measured using the 3--2,5-dephenyltetrazolium
    bromide  assay, according to the manufacturers protocol.', 'The cell proliferation
    was determined by measuring the BrdU incorporation using a BrdU incorporation
    assay, according to the manufacturers instructions.', 'Briefly, 5,000 cells/well
    seeded in a 96-well plate were pulse-labelled for 2 h with 10-uM BrdU.', 'The
    cells were incubated for 30 min with a diluted, peroxidase-conjugated anti-BrdU
    antibody.', The absorbance values were measured at 450 nm using an ELISA reader.,
  The cell migration assays were performed using Transwell chambers., A total of 50
    K cells were plated into the insert in 200 l serum-free medium containing BSA
    or 400 M BSA-bound oleic acid and allowed to migrate from the upper compartment
    to the lower compartment toward a 15% FBS gradient for the indicated time period.,
  'After the migration, the non-migratory cells on the upper membrane surface were
    removed by scrubbing, and the membrane was fixed in buffered 4% paraformaldehyde
    and stained with 0.1% crystal violet at room temperature.', The migrated cells
    were then enumerated., The migration values were expressed as the average number
    of migrated cells per microscopic field over six fields per assay from three independent
    membrane experiments., The cells were harvested and lysed for the total protein
    extraction., The protein concentration was determined using a Bio-Rad DC protein
    assay kit  according to the manufacturers protocol., The aliquots of equal amounts
    of protein from the cell lysate were subjected to western blot analysis., 'The
    antibodies used in this study include those specific for phospho-Thr172-AMPKa,
    AMPKa, phospho-Ser96-ACC, ACC, ATGL, caspase9, caspase3, CPT1a, MCAD, GAPDH and
    -actin.', The densitometry was performed using ImageJ software  and normalised
    by the GAPDH or -actin levels., The AMPK1 siRNA and a nonspecific siRNA  were
    purchased from RiboBio., 'According to the manufacturers instructions, the transfections
    were performed at approximately 60% confluency using Lipofectamine 2000.', 'For
    each transfection reaction, 20 nM AMPK1 siRNA or control siRNA was used for the
    preparation of the siRNA-transfection complexes at room temperature for 20 min.',
  The transfections were performed in 0.5- or 1.5-mL  serum-free medium for 8 hr.,
  'After incubation, the transfection complexes were removed and replaced with their
    corresponding media.', The transfection efficiency  was determined by western
    blotting analysis., The cells were used for western blotting analysis and cell
    viability 2472 hr after transfection., The lipid droplets were stained by Oil
    red O., 'A stock solution was prepared in 2-propanol, and a working solution was
    freshly prepared by diluting the stock solution with water.', 'After fixation,
    the cells were washed twice in PBS and stained with Oil red O and hematoxylin
    for 15 min and 1 min, respectively.', 'The cells were washed with PBS, and images
    were obtained under a light contrast microscope.', The intracellular triglycerides
    were assayed using a triglyceride assay kit  according to the manufacturers recommended
    protocol., 'Five million cells were resuspended in 1 ml of fresh warm medium pre-equilibrated
    with 21% oxygen and placed in a sealed respiration chamber equipped with a thermostat
    control, micro stirring device and Clark-type oxygen electrode disc.', 'The oxygen
    content in the cell suspension medium was constantly monitored for 10 min, and
    the oxygen consumption rate was recorded.', The intracellular level of ATP was
    measured with an ATPlite assay kit., 'The cells were incubated in a serum-free
    medium with or without 400 M of OA for 48 h, washed with PBS three times, lysed
    in ATP extraction buffer and centrifuged in 4C.', ATP was measured by luminometric
    methods using commercially available luciferin/luciferase reagents on a luminometer  according
    to the manufacturers instructions., The data were normalised to total protein.,
  The data are presented as the means  SD., 'SPSS 13.0 software was used for the statistical
    evaluation using one-way ANOVA for comparison of more than two groups, and LSD-t
    test, Dunnetts T3 or Tamhanes T2 were used for the multiple comparisons.', Students
    t test was used for the comparison of the two groups., P values of less than 0.05
    were considered significant., 'To better clarify the role of oleic acid in tumour
    growth, we examined the effects of oleic acid on the cell viability of human gastric
    carcinoma cell lines and breast cancer cell lines, respectively.', As shown in
    Fig., '1A, 400 M of BSA-bound oleic acid stimulated obvious cell viability in
    HGC-27 cells after 24, 48, and 72 hours of exposure.', 'A decrease in cell viability
    was observed in the AGS, SGC7901 and BGC823 cells treated with OA.', 'In the MDA-MB-231
    cells, OA had an effect on cell viability similar to that of the HGC-27 cells,
    more profoundly with the 72-hours treatment.', We observed an inhibitory effect
    of OA on cell viability in the MCF-7 cells., Figure 1., Effects of oleic acid
    on cell survival in various human cancer cell lines., Human gastric cancer cell
    lines  and breast cancer cell lines  were starved for 12 hours and then incubated
    with 0.5% BSA as the control or 400 M BSA-bound oleic acid for the indicated time
    period., The cell viability was determined by an MTT assay and expressed as a
    percentage of the control cells., 'The values are the mean  SD, n = 3; p;0.01
    vs. BSA at the indicated time points.', Students t test., 'The cells were incubated
    with 0.5% BSA or 400-M BSA-bound oleic acid for the indicated time points, and
    the cell proliferation was examined using BrdU ELISA.', 'The values are the mean  SD,
    n = 3; p&lt;0.05 and p&lt;0.01 for OA compared with BSA.Students t test.', 'For
    a better assessment of the reason for the cell viability change induced by OA,
    we first determined the cell proliferation using BrdU ELISA.', The assessment
    shows that cell proliferation was significantly higher in the OA groups compared
    with the control group in the HGC-27 and MDA-MB-231 cells; OA exhibited a slight
    inhibition of cell proliferation in the SGC7901 and MCF-7 cells., The Hoechst
    staining and flow cytometry analysis indicated that OA afforded protection against
    apoptosis in the HGC-27 and MDA-MB-231 cells whereas it induced apoptosis in the
    SGC7901 cells and MCF-7 cells., 'Mechanically, the level of cleaved caspase3 and
    cleaved caspase9 were changed in the OA-treated cells compared to that in the
    control group, suggesting that mitochondrial apoptotic pathway might be involved
    in this progress.', 'To further determine the action of OA on cell migration,
    we used Transwell chamber assays to gauge the migratory ability of the cells treated
    with OA.', The cells were plated into the insert in a serum-free medium containing
    BSA or 400 M of BSA-bound oleic acid and allowed to migrate from the upper compartment
    to the lower compartment toward a 15% FBS gradient., 'OA prompted an obvious increase
    in the migration of the HGC-27 and MDA-MB-231 cells, whereas this process was
    reduced in the SGC7901 cells.', Figure 2., Effects of oleic acid on cell migration
    of gastric carcinoma cells and breast cancer cells., Cells treated with 0.5% BSA
    or 400 M BSA-bound oleic acid were allowed to migrate from upper compartment to
    lower compartment toward a 15% FBS gradient for 12 hours in HGC-27 and SGC7901
    cells and 6 hours in MDA-MB-231 cells., 'After then the migrated cells were fixed,
    stained, and photographed  and  the migrated cells were then enumerated and normalised
    to the control, #p&lt;0.05 for OA compared with BSA.Students t test.', 'Exogenous
    OA transported into the cells is converted into acyl-CoA, which is esterified
    with glycerol to yield inert triacylglycerols  or -oxidation,.', 'Based on these
    findings, we hypothesised that the disparity in the cellular biological function
    treated by OA between the high metastatic cancer cells  and low metastatic cancer
    cells  is ascribed to the difference in the ability of intracellular TG lipolysis.',
  'We detected the expression of adipose triglyceride lipase, which catalyses the
    initial step of lipolysis, converting TGs to diacylglycerols.', 'ATGL was completely
    stimulated in all the cells treated by OA compared to the control cells, demonstrating
    that lipolysis was not the distinction separating the high metastatic cancer cells
    from the low metastatic cancer cells.', Figure 3., The AMPK pathway was selectively
    activated in various human cancer cells treated with oleic acid., The cells were
    incubated with 0.5% BSA or 400 M of BSA-bound oleic acid for 48 hours., 'The levels
    of phosphorylated AMPK, the total AMPK, pACC, the total ACC, CPT1 and ATGL were
    determined by western blot analysis using 50 g of the total proteins from each
    sample.', The Quantification of Protein expression by densitometry from three
    independent experiments normalised to GAPDH., 'The values are expressed as the
    percent of control cells, given as the mean  SD, n = 3; p&lt;0.01 for OA compared
    with BSA.Students t test.', 'AMPK, a fuel sensor, plays an important role in regulating
    fatty acid -oxidation and is involved in the different effects OA has on cell
    function.', We performed a comprehensive analysis of the expression of AMPK and
    a downstream gene by western blotting in various cancer cells., 'Phosphorylation
    of AMPK was selectively up regulated by OA in the HGC-27 and MDA-MB-231 cells,
    and there was no obvious change in the SGC7901 and MCF-7 cells.', 'Carnitine palmitoyl
    transferase 1, which catalyses the transport of long-chain fatty acids  into mitochondria
    for -oxidation, is highly inhibited by the malonyl CoA that is catalysed in mitochondria
    by acetyl-CoA carboxylase.', 'AMPK could phosphorylate and inactivate ACC, thus
    the ACC-dependent malonyl CoA levels fall, releasing the inhibition of CPT1, which
    facilitates the mitochondrial entry of the LCFAs for -oxidation,.', As shown in
    Fig., '3A, OA significantly increased the phosphorylation of ACC in the HGC-27
    cells and mildly affected the ACC in the MDA-MB-231 cells.', The expression of
    CPT1 was up regulated consistently by OA in those two cell lines., 'Consistently,
    the oxygen consumption rate of the MDA-MB-231 cells in the medium containing OA
    was significantly higher compared to that of the cells grown in the control medium.',
  The oxygen consumption rate of the MCF-7 cells grown in the medium containing OA
    did not differ significantly from that of the control cells., These results suggested
    that AMPK activation participated in the utilisation of OA through -oxidation
    and maintained a metabolic advantage., 'To further confirm that AMPK activation
    was involved in the utilisation of OA for growth, survival and migration in the
    cancer cell lines, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1--D-ribofuranoside and Compound
    C were used.', 'As shown in Figure 4A, the addition of Compound C to the HGC-27
    and MDA-MB-231 cells suppressed the facilitation of growth by OA.', The treatment
    with AICAR restrained the growth inhibition by OA in the SGC7901 and MCF-7 cells.,
  Figure 4., AMPK activation facilitates cancer cell growth and survival in the presence
    of oleic acid., 'The cells were cultured with 0.5% BSA or 400 M of BSA-bound oleic
    acid with 5 M of Compound C or with 100 M of AICAR for 24, 48, of 72 hours.',
  The cell viability was determined using a MTT assayat the indicated time points.,
  'The values are the mean  SD, n = 3; p&lt;0.05 and p&lt;0.01 for OA+Compound C or
    OA+AICAR compared with OA.one-way ANOVA followed by Fishers LSD test.', 'The cells
    transfected with control-siRNA or AMPK1-siRNA were treated with 0.5% BSA or 400
    M of BSA-bound oleic acid for 24, 48, 72, of 96 hours.', The cell viability was
    determined using an MTT assay and expressed as the percentage of the control cells
    at the indicated time points., 'The values are the mean  SD, n = 3; p&lt;0.05
    for OA+ AMPK1-siRNA compared with OA+control-siRNA.one-way ANOVA followed by Fishers
    LSD test.', The cells were cultured with 0.5% BSA or 400 M of BSA-bound oleic
    acid with 5 M of Compound C or with 100 M of AICAR for 48 or 72 hours., The cell
    proliferation was examined using BrdU ELISA at the indicated time points., 'The
    values are the mean  SD, n = 3; # p&lt;0.05 for OA+Compound C or OA+AICAR compared
    with OA.', one-way ANOVA followed by LSD test., The statistical comparison of
    the percentage of the control cells in the cell-migration ability., 'All of the
    statistical analysis values represent the mean of three experiments (the means  SD,
    n = 3, p&lt;0.05 and p&lt;0.01 for OA compared with BSA; #p&lt;0.05 and ##p&lt;0.01
    for OA+Compound C or OA+AICAR compared with OA.', one-way ANOVA followed by LSD
    test., We designed siRNA specific to the AMPK catalytic 1-subunit to reduce the
    protein levels because AMPK is activated by phosphorylation of Thr172 on the catalytic
    -subunit., The western blot assay confirmed an obvious reduction in the protein
    level in the MAD-MB-231 cells., 'As depicted in Figure 4B, consistent with the
    exposure to Compound C, silencing of the AMPK catalytic -subunit by treatment
    with OA caused a reduction of cell viability after 72 hours.', There was a question
    regarding whether the alteration of cell proliferation and migration relied on
    AMPK activation in the cells treated by OA., 'As shown in Figures 4 C&amp;D, Compound
    C elicited a 1.0 to 1.5-fold decrease in cell proliferation and migration in the
    OA-treated HGC-27 and MAD-MB-231 cells, whereas the reduction of cell proliferation
    and migration in the OA-treated SGC7901 and MCF-7 cells was compensated for by
    AICAR.', 'Collectively, these data suggested that AMPK activation is critical
    for the cancer cell survival and growth induced by OA.', We assessed whether AMPK
    has a function in regulating the lipid accumulation induced by OA., 'Consistent
    with other observations, the lipid droplet material stained by Oil red O increased
    in the OA-treated MDA-MB-231, HGC-27 and SGC7901 cells compared to the control
    cells, suggesting that cancer cells are able to esterify oleate for storage as
    TG.', 'The lipid droplets in the OA-treated MDA-MB-231 cells were diffused with
    small granules, indicating that the TG stored in lipid droplets was simultaneously
    hydrolysed and provided with energy.', 'Consistent with the Oil red O staining,
    the cellular triglyceride content assay indicated that OA induced TG accumulation
    significantly for the initial 6 hours, which was consumed during the next 30 hours
    in incubation with fresh medium in the absence of OA.', 'Compound C attenuated
    the TG consumption compared to the control group, as shown in Figure 5B.', This
    finding demonstrated that the inhibition of AMPK signalling impeded the utilisation
    of OA and fatty acid metabolism in an obvious manner., Figure 5., AMPK is pivotal
    to utilise OA and provide ATP for cancer cell growth and survival., The MDA-MB-231
    cells were cultured with 0.5% BSA or 400 M of BSA-bound oleic acid with 5 M of
    Compound C or with 100 M of AICAR for 48 h. The cells were stained with Oil red
    O with 400 magnification., 'The MDA-MB-231 cells were pretreated with 400 M of
    oleic acid for 6 h and refreshed with medium containing 5 M of Compound C or with
    100 M of AICAR for another 30 h.  The cells were digested, and the intracellular
    triglycerides were assayed using a triglyceride assay kit, normalised to the protein
    content.The data are presented as the mean  SD, n = 3, p&lt;0.05, p&lt;0.01.',
  The oxygen content in the cell suspension medium was constantly monitored for 10
    min in the different groups., The oxygen consumption was normalised against the
    number of viable cells being measured., 'The data are presented as the mean  SD,
    n = 3, p&lt;0.05, p&lt;0.01.', Various cancer cells were cultured with 0.5% BSA
    or 400 M of BSA-bound oleic acid with 5 M of Compound C or with 100 M of AICAR
    for 48 h. The ATP level was determined with a commercial assay and normalised
    to the protein content., 'The data are presented as the mean  SD, n = 3, p&lt;0.05
    for OA compared with BSA; #p&lt;0.05 for OA+Compound C or OA+AICAR compared with
    OA.', Multiple groups were compared using one-way ANOVA followed by Fishers LSD
    test., 'To further elucidate the mitochondrial respiratory chain activity, we
    measured the oxygen consumption rate in the cells with different treatments.',
  'This result indicated that OA stimulated the oxygen consumption whereas Compound
    C reduced the oxygen consumption in the MDA-MB-231 cells, suggesting that AMPK
    might participate in the intracellular fatty acids flux into mitochondria for
    -oxidation.', We determined whether AMPK activation is directly attributable to
    the ATP production influenced by the OA stress in our cell models., The intracellular
    levels of ATP in the various treated groups of different cell lines were measured.,
  'As shown in figure 5E, the inhibition of the AMPK signalling by Compound C attenuated
    the increase of ATP production in the HGC-27 and MDA-MB-231 cells treated with
    OA, whereas the AICAR compensated for the ATP level by activating the AMPK signalling
    in the SGC7901 and MCF-7 cells.', These data support our hypothesis that the activation
    state of AMPK is a switch in the cells to respond to OA by mediating fatty acid
    metabolism., 'To understand the accurate molecular mechanism by which AMPK activation
    determined the effects of OA on cellular function, we examined the status of AMPK
    activation and the expression of related enzymes regarding the FFA metabolism.',
  It was parallel to the data shown in Figure 3 and demonstrated that OA activated
    the AMPK signalling by up-regulating the phosphorylation of AMPK and ACC., 'This
    up regulation is accompanied by an increase in the expression of CPT1, whereas
    this induction was obviously attenuated by Compound C in the HGC-27 and MDA-MB-231
    cells.', 'Apparently, AMPK was not stimulated in the MCF-7 or SGC7901 cells in
    the presence of OA.', 'When AICAR was added to the medium, the level of the phosphorylated
    AMPK and ACCwas increased, as well as the CPT1 and MCAD levels, which catalysed
    crucial steps in the mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation.', 'To confirm further
    the implication of the AMPK signalling in the OA action, we transfected the AMPK1-siRNA
    in the HGC-27 and MAD-MB-231 cells, and then treated the cells with OA or BSA,
    as the control.', 'As shown in Figure 6B, silencing the AMPK caused a reduction
    in the expression of phosphorylated AMPK and ACC with CPT1 and MCAD.', Figure
    6., AMPK is involved in the OA-mediated protein expressions of fatty acid metabolism
    enzymes., 'The gastric carcinoma cells and breast cancer cells were cultured with
    0.5% BSA or 400 M of BSA-bound oleic acid with 5 M of Compound C or with 100 M
    of AICAR for 48 h. The levels of pAMPK, the total AMPK, pACC, the total ACC, CPT1,
    MCAD and ATGL were determined by western blot analysis using 50 g of the total
    proteins from each sample.', A representative blot is shown., The cells transfected
    with control-siRNA or AMPK1-siRNA  were treated with 0.5% BSA or 400 M of BSA-bound
    oleic acid for another 48 hours., 'The expressions of pAMPK, the total AMPK, pACC,
    the total ACC, CPT1, MCAD and ATGL were determined by western blot analysis.',
  'Although the expression of ATGL was completely stimulated in all the cells treated
    by OA compared to the control cells, it was not influenced by the AMPK status,
    suggesting that ATGL, at least at the protein level, was not regulated by AMPK
    in the conditions of the OA treatment.', These data suggested that AMPK is critical
    for OA stimulation of cancer cell survival and growth through the promotion of
    fatty acid oxidation., The data presented in this study demonstrated that oleic
    acid selectively promotes cell proliferation and migration in high metastatic
    cancer cells whereas it has inhibitory effects in low metastatic cancer cells.,
  'Although for decades it has been well accepted that AMPK activation suppresses
    cell growth and proliferation,, new evidence that AMPK activation promotes certain
    human cancer cell growth and survival emerged recently in such as prostate and
    ovarian cancer and in glioma cells,,.', 'Our data reinforced this new concept
    with additional information elucidated the unique characteristics of energy metabolism
    in high metastatic cancer cells encountering metabolic stress from oleic acid
    exposure, which was mediated by AMPK activation that resulted in enhanced fatty
    acid oxidation.', The physiological roles of oleic acid in health and disease
    in humans are minimally investigated and understood., High-metastatic cancer cells
    and low metastatic cancer cells had opposite responses to oleic acid treatment
    with respect to cell survival and migration., 'As shown, the HGC-27 and MDA-MB-231
    cells grew faster in the presence of oleic acid.', There is increasing evidence
    that cancer cells show specific alterations in different aspects of lipid metabolism.,
  'The changes in lipid metabolism affect numerous cellular processes, including cell
    growth, proliferation and motility.', 'Metabolically, the high metastastic cancer
    cells setting from low metastastic cancer cells are endowed with rapid growth
    and high migration ability, which are because of the distinct metabolism trait.',
  We concluded that high metastatic cancer cells with high-level consumption for energy
    utilise OA more efficiently than their counterpart cells., The molecular differences
    induced by OA in these two cell groups are unclear., AMPK is a key regulator of
    energy homeostasis within cells., 'On activation, AMPK switches off the ATP-consuming
    biosynthetic pathways  and activates the ATP-generating metabolic pathways  to
    preserve the ATP levels for cell survival.', This study was the first to unmask
    AMPK activation as a possible mechanism for the intrinsic correlation between
    OA and different cell fates., 'Mechanically, we found increased AMPK activation,
    based on Thr172 phosphorylation, in the high metastatic cancer cells exposed to
    OA, which exhibited the promotion of cell proliferation and migration.', 'As shown,
    the total and phosphorylated AMPK and ACC amounts as well as CPT1 were remarkably
    high in the HGC-27 and MDA-MB-231 cells, although the ATGL level was up-regulated
    in these two cell groups.', The role of fatty acid oxidation in the altered energy
    metabolism of cancer cells is less clear and might have been influenced by the
    culture conditions to which the cells were exposed., Our data suggested that -oxidation
    rather than lipolysis is the main change in the microenvironment with OA; the
    data support a possible functional link between AMPK and the altered energy metabolism
    in cancer cells., The selective AMPK activation in high metastatic cancer cells
    results in energy metabolism plasticity or adaptation., This assumption was further
    sustained by the data obtained by inhibition or stimulation of AMPK activity.,
  'As shown in Figure 4, in the HGC-27 and MDA-MB-231 cells with AMPK activation induced
    by OA, the inhibition of AMPK by Compound C or AMPK1 siRNA attenuated the increase
    of cell growth and migration, and the artificial activation of AMPK by AICAR in
    the SGC7901 and MCF7 cells compensated these inhibitory effects induced by OA.',
  'AMPK contributes to the maintenance of high ATP levels, which might remain remarkably
    stable for high energy-dependent molecular activities.', 'Consistently, we found
    elevated levels of cellular ATP with AMPK activation and reduced ATP levels with
    inhibition of AMPK by Compound C in the OA-treated HGC-27 and MDA-MB-231 cells,
    whereas AIACR activated AMPK, subsequently leading to the ATP production in the
    SGC7901 and MCF7 cells.', The significant increase in oxygen consumption induced
    by oleic acid could be reduced by AMPK inhibition., ATP production apparently
    results from the activation of AMPK and downstream enzymes., 'To support this
    mechanism, the study interpreted the intrinsic link between AMPK activation and
    the cellular behaviours.', 'As shown in Figure 6, Compound C or AMPK1 siRNA reduced
    the total and phosphorylated AMPK and ACC as well as the subsequent CPT1 and MCAD
    levels, and AIACR compensated for these corresponding changes.', 'One possible
    explanation for the difference between high and low malignancy cells would be
    the inability of the low malignancy cells to increase AMPK and ACC gene expression
    in response to OA.Thus, it is possible that the long-term effects promoted by
    the constitutive AMPK activation support the adaptation of metastatic cells to
    the energy pathways that are predominant in specific metabolic stress and that
    contribute to the growth advantage of tumour cells.', 'The two AMPK variants  have
    a differential localisation pattern in mammalian cells, with the AMPK-1 subunit
    being localised in the cytoplasm whereas the AMPK-2 subunit is localised in the
    nucleus.', 'The transfection of cells with AMPK-1 siRNA, and not AMPK-2siRNA,
    abolished the effects of OA on the cell viability and protein expressions of phosphorylated
    ACC, CPT1 and MCAD.', 'The downstream genes of AMPK, including ACC, that are localised
    in the cytoplasm suggest that at least some of the effects that were observed
    in the study are primarily because of the alpha-1 activity.', 'The AMPK system
    is activated by a large variety of cellular stresses that deplete ATP, such as
    glucose deprivation, ischemia, hypoxia, oxidative stress and hyperosmotic stress.It
    has been demonstrated in cultured adipocytes that agents that increase intracellular
    cAMP increase the activity of AMPK.', Wu has reported that treatment of bovine
    aortic endothelial cells  with OA-NO2 induced a significant increase in AMPKThr172
    phosphorylation and AMPK activity., 'Recent reports have shown that oncogenic
    Ras, MYC and Pten deletion activates AMPK and that this activation stimulates
    cell proliferation,.', We hypothesise that the intracellular stresses or the oncogene
    induced by OA treatment in high metastatic cancer cells contribute to the activation
    of AMPK., The accurate mechanisms involved inthe regulation of AMPK in response
    to OA warrant further investigation., Oleic acid prompted cell proliferation and
    migration in high metastatic cancer cells via enhanced -oxidation mediated by
    AMPK activation., 'Provided that these observations might be extended to the in
    vivo situation, it could be postulated that a microenvironment rich in oleic acid
    might favour tumour progression.', 'We reported for the first time that activated
    AMPK is involved in OA-induced cell proliferation and migration in terms of energy
    metabolism, which offers novel potential targets for the chemoprevention of human
    cancer.', Effects of oleic acid on cell apotosis in various human cancer cell
