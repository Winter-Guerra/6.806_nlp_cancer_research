text: [It is now well accepted that tumor cells actively communicate with the tumor
    microenvironment  leading to the progression of breast cancer and other malignancies.,
  It is also known that adipose mesenchymal stem cells  have the ability to differentiate
    into mature adipocytes and initiate cytokine signaling within the tumor microenvironment.,
  'Here, we examine the role of MSC-differentiated adipocytes on breast cancer cell
    migration, and test the effects of sulforaphane  on adipocytebreast cancer cell
    interaction.', Our results demonstrate that SFN promotes MSC self-renewal and
    inhibits adipogenic differentiation., 'Subsequently, SFN treatment of adipocytes
    considerably hinders cytokine communication with breast cancer cells, thereby
    decreasing breast cancer cell migration and tumor formation.', 'Sulforaphane Mammary
    Adipogenesis Adipose Mesenchymal stem cells Breast cancer cells


    Adipocytes function to store reserves of nourishment in times of abundance, and
    to release these reserves in times of need.', This ability of adipose tissue to
    maintain the necessary amount of energy for use in metabolism is essential for
    the survival of any organism., 'Adipocytes differentiate from mesenchymal stem
    cells  in a process known as adipogenesis, and normally surround themselves with
    a network of other cell types that include fibroblasts, preadipocytic cells, endothelial
    cells, and immune cells.', 'During adipogenesis, MSCs from adipose tissue proliferate
    and differentiate into lipid-assimilating cells in a two-stage process: the first
    stage being the commitment stage, in which MSCs commit to becoming preadipocytes,
    and the second stage being the terminal differentiation stage.', 'During adipogenic
    competency and commitment, extracellular matrix  and cell shape remodeling play
    a role in coordinating various signaling cascades.', Adipogenic commitment involves
    many key regulators that are modulated during the transition between MSCs and
    preadipocytes., 'These include OCT4, KLF4, and SOX family members, the latter
    of which are known to inhibit adipogenesis through SOX-mediated self-renewal signaling
    cascades.', 'Terminal differentiation begins with the expression of two families
    of genes that encode the regulatory proteins CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein  and
    the adipogenic key regulator, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma.',
  Adipogenic stimuli promote the downregulation of SOX9 and the increased expression
    of C/EBP and C/EBP., Differentiated adipocytes can secrete a number of chemokines
    and cytokines that exert paracrine signaling in order to interact with the surrounding
    environment., Such communication between adipocytes and mammary epithelial cells
    promotes breast cancer progression., 'Sulforaphane, a bioactive component found
    in broccoli, displays anti-inflammatory characteristics along with antioxidant
    activity and activation of apoptotic signaling pathways.', 'As such, the consumption
    of broccoli and other cruciferous vegetables provides the potential to lower cancer
    risk and incidence due to their antitumor effects.', 'Although recent studies
    have shown that SFN can mediate lipolysis in adipocytes, not much is known about
    the role of SFN in the adipogenic differentiation of MSCs.', 'We show here that
    the dietary compound, SFN can inhibit adipogenesis and suppress the interaction
    between adipocytes and breast cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo.', Human
    adipose-derived MSCs  were obtained from American Type Culture Collection  and
    from the lipoaspirate of healthy humans following MSC enrichment., Cells were
    maintained in basal medium  plus supplements., Human mammary preadipocytes  were
    purchased from ZenBio., 'After confluence, the cells were placed in Adipocyte
    Differentiation Medium  to begin differentiation.', 'After 7 days, the differentiated
    adipocytes were replaced with Adipocyte Maintenance Medium.', 'Murine 3T3 L1 preadipocytes  were
    cultured in high-glucose Dulbeccos modified Eagles medium  supplemented with 10
    % bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin.', 'The confluent 3T3 L1 preadipocytes
    were induced to differentiate using medium supplemented with 1 g/ml bovine insulin,
    1 M dexamethasone, 0.5 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, 8 g/ml biotin, and 10 %
    fetal bovine serum.', The differentiated 3T3 L1 cells were maintained in medium
    containing 10 % FBS supplemented with 1 g/ml insulin and 8 g/ml biotin., Breast
    cancer cells  and SUM102PT ) were obtained from Asterand  and were grown in DMEM/F12
    supplemented with 5 % horse serum  and 1 % l-glutamine., Cells were incubated
    in an atmosphere containing 5 % CO2 at 37 C. SFN was purchased from LKT laboratories.,
  Adipocytes were rinsed with PBS and fixed by 10 % formalin at room temperature for
    30 min., 'Oil Red O working solution  was prepared immediately prior to the staining,
    and then incubated with cells for 30 min at room temperature.', Stained cells
    were washed two times with distilled water., Oil Red O-stained cells were visualized
    by Nikon Eclipse Ti-U microscope., 'To quantify the amount of Oil Red O-stained
    lipid droplets, stained cells were eluted with 100 % isopropyl alcohol for 10
    min and the OD of the solution was measured at 500 nm in a microplate reader.',
  Total RNA was extracted with TRIzol reagent., cDNA was synthesized from 2 g of total
    RNA using moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase., Quantitative real-time
    PCR  was carried out using a Light Cycler 480II., Adipose-derived mescenchymal
    stem cells were separated using dissociation buffer  and then seeded in six-well
    plates  coated with 2 % poly-hema., Spheres  were counted as we previously described.,
  'After stimulation with adipocyte differentiation cocktail, human mammary preadipocytes
    differentiated into adipocytes.', These adipocytes were cocultured with breast
    cancer cells  for 3 days., DCIS and PT cells were harvested for cell migration
    assays., In vitro migration assays were carried out in duplicate using transwell
    migration chambers., 'DCIS and PT cells were seeded in the upper chamber, and
    the lower chamber was incubated with medium plus 10 % FBS.', Migrated cells were
    stained with 1 % crystal violet in 40 % methanol/PBS and counted using microscopy.,
  Screening for cytokines secreted from human adipocytes was performed by hybridizing
    conditioned medium with antibody-coated membranes  according to the manufacturers
    instructions., 'Briefly, human adipocytes were cultured with or without DCIS cells
    for 3 days.', The culture supernatants were collected by centrifugation and then
    hybridized to the array membrane., A biotin-conjugated second antibody was used
    and cytokines were detected by HRP-conjugated streptavidin., Signals were quantified
    by UN-SCAN-IT gel 6.1 software., DCIS cells  were seeded in the top chamber of
    the Transwell., 'To evaluate the interaction of DCIS cells with adipocytes, DCIS
    cells were cocultured with human adipocytes.', 'After 3 days, DCIS cells were
    collected, washed twice with cold PBS, and then injected into mammary gland in
    67 weeks old immunodeficient Nu/Nu female mice.', 'Tumor growth was monitored
    weekly by caliper measurements   0.5)), where L is the length and W is the width
    of each tumor.', Studies were conducted under animal protocols approved by the
    University of Maryland School of Medicine/Animal Care and Usage Committee., Statistical
    analysis was performed with GraphPad Prism 6.0 software., 'Data were assessed
    by Students t test with P values of ;0.05 considered significant, unless stated
    otherwise.', Adipocyte-rich microenvironment plays a vital role in tumor progression.,
  'It is known that adipocytes may function as endocrine cells by producing hormones,
    cytokines, and other growth factors, thus altering tumor cell behavior and promoting
    tumor progression.', 'Since adipocytes differentiate from MSCs, we examined the
    impact of SFN on MSCs.', MSCs were isolated from human adipose tissue and were
    allowed to differentiate into adipocytes., 'First, we employed a specific colony
    assaya method relying on the formation of spheroids during suspension cultureto
    determine their in vitro capability of self-renewal.', 'Sphere formation is a
    surrogate for stem cell growth and expansion, so we examined the impact of SFN
    treatment on sphere formation in MSCs.', SFN treatment resulted in a statistically
    significant increase in sphere formation., 'It is now well accepted that expression
    levels of OCT4, KLF4, and SOX2 tightly control stem cell self-renewal and differentiation.',
  MSCs were found to express these regulators whereas differentiated adipocyte cells
    express very low levels of these regulators., 'OCT4, KLF4, and SOX2 were detectable
    by qRT-PCR in MSCs, whereas SFN-treated MSCs demonstrated remarkable OCT4, KLF4,
    and SOX2 over-expression.', 'These data indicate that OCT4, KLF4, and SOX2 are
    important stem cell regulators in MSCs and that SFN treatment increases these
    regulators that control stem cell self-renewal pathways.', SFN treatment increases
    self-renewal in adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells., A Adipose-derived mesenchymal
    stem cells  were seeded on attachment-free 6-well plates., 'After 7 days, spheres  were
    quantified.', Data were from two independent experiments which showed the mean  SD.,
  P &lt; 0.05., 'Scale bars 50 m. B MSCs were treated with 10 M SFN for 7 days, mRNA
    from MSCs was extracted and expression levels of SOX2, KLF4, and OCT4 mRNA were
    measured by quantitative real-time PCR.', Data were from three independent experiments.,
  'P &lt; 0.05; P &lt; 0.01


    Having demonstrated a link between SFN treatment and regulation of stem cell regulators
    in MSCs, we next examined the impact of SFN modulation on stem cell differentiation
    properties.', We used human mammary preadipocytes to determine how SFN treatment
    alters adipocyte differentiation in vitro., 'In the presence of adipocyte differentiation
    cocktail for 14 days, these cells differentiated into mature adipocytes  associated
    with lipid accumulation, indicating that these stem cells  can differentiate into
    mature human adipocytes in vitro.', We then investigated if SFN may contribute
    to alterations of adipocyte differentiation., Preadipocytes were grown to confluence
    and then differentiated by adding hormone cocktail in the presence or absence
    of SFN., As shown in Fig., '2B, Oil Red O-stained cells were remarkably reduced
    in the presence of SFN treatment.', Expression of adipocyte differentiation genes
    was examined by qRT-PCR analyses in SFN-treated and SFN-untreated cells., 'C/EBP
    transcript levels were reduced in SFN-treated cells as compared with SFN-untreated
    cells, confirming that SFN inhibits preadipocyte differentiation to mature adipocytes.',
  SFN treatment inhibits preadipocyte differentiation., A Oil Red O staining of human
    preadipocyte differentiation at 14 days., 'Left, phase-contrast images of differentiated

    or absence of SFN treatment, and mRNA from differentiated 3T3 L1 was collected.',
  Expression of C/EBP mRNA levels was analyzed by qRT-PCR., All the experiments were
    performed in triplicate., 'P &lt; 0.01


    Adipocytes have demonstrated the ability to stimulate tumor cell survival and
    invasiveness in vitro and in vivo.', 'Since we observed that SFN treatment reduces
    MSC-directed differentiation, we next examined how SFN impacts a cross talk between
    adipocytes and tumor cells.', Breast cancer cells  were cocultured with human
    adipocytes., 'After 3 days, DCIS cells were trypsinized and migration assays were
    conducted in a medium containing 10 % FBS.', As shown in Fig., '3A, DCIS cells
    previously cocultured with adipocytes showed an increase in cell migration as
    compared with uncocultured DCIS cells.', This effect was not observed when DCIS
    cells were cocultured with undifferentiated preadipocytes., Similar results were
    obtained with the SUM102PT cells., 'Therefore, these results indicate that mature
    adipocytes are able to stimulate the cell migration capacities of human breast
    cancer cells.', 'When DCIS or PT cells were cocultured with adipocytes in the
    presence of SFN treatment, these tumor cell migration capacities were significantly
    decreased.', These results highlight that a cross talk between the two cell populations
    is necessary to obtain this effect., Our results demonstrate that SFN treatment
    can reduce breast cancer cell migration in a cocultured adipocyte environment.,
  Cocultures of breast cancer cells with human adipocytes enhances breast cancer cell
    migration capabilities., DCIS  or PT  cells were cultured with or without adipocytes.,
  These cells were treated with or without 10 M SFN., 'After 3 days of SFN treatment,
    DCIS or PT cells were trypsinized and collected for the cell migration assay.',
  Migrated DCIS or PT cells were stained by crystal violet., Cell migration was quantified.,
  Data were from three independent experiments., 'Scale bars are 100 m. P &lt; 0.01;  P
    &lt; 0.02


    Our coculture experiments show that adipocytes stimulate breast cancer cell migration
    in vitro.', 'To identify factors responsible for promoting breast cancer cell
    migration, we searched for the growth factors/cytokines secreted by mature adipocytes,
    which exert critical functions in the formation of the tumor microenvironment.',
  'To define cytokines in human adipocytes, we performed human cytokine antibody arrays
    to examine the differential cytokine expression in conditioned media prepared
    from adipocytes alone or adipocytes cocultured with DCIS cells.', The medium from
    adipocytes and adipocytes cocultured with DCIS cells were collected and the cytokine
    antibody arrays were used to detect the expression of 42 key cytokines simultaneously.,
  'Among 42 cytokines tested, the six cytokines most abundantly secreted by adipocytes
    cocultured with DCIS cells were GRO-, ENA-78, IL-6, GRO, MCP-1, and IL-8.', These
    cytokines have been known to exhibit both inflammatory and growth regulatory functions.,
  These data suggest that the observed increase in pro-inflammatory molecules may
    contribute to changes in tumor cell migration in vitro., Adipocyte-DCIS cell coculture
    stimulates cytokine release and promotes tumor formation in vivo., A Cytokine
    expression was detected by a human cytokine antibody array., Conditioned medium
    was collected from human adipocytes alone or from DCIS cells cocultured with human
    adipocytes., Cytokines in conditioned medium were detected by a human cytokine
    antibody array., Signals were quantified and the cytokines most abundantly secreted
    by DCIS cells cocultured with human adipocytes were listed., 'GRO and GRO growth-related
    cytokine superfamily, ENA78 epithelial neutrophil-activating protein 78, IL-6
    and IL-8 interleukin 6 and 8, MCP-1 monocyte chemoattractant protein 1.', B mRNA
    was collected from DCIS cocultured human adipocytes in the presence or absence
    of 10 M SFN or SAHA treatment for 3 days., Levels of IL-6 mRNA were measured by
    qRT-PCR., Data were from three independent experiments., P &lt; 0.05., C DCIS
    cells cocultured with human adipocytes were treated with or without 10 M SFN.,
  'After 3 days of SFN treatment, DCIS cells were collected and then were injected
    into mammary glands.', Tumor volume was measured weekly., The tumor volume results
    are presented as mean  S.E.M., 'N = 5 mice/group


    Since IL-6 is of particular importance due to its inflammatory stimulation, we,
    therefore, quantified the mRNA expression levels of IL-6 in DCIS cells cocultured
    with human adipocytes.', We compared the effects of treatment with SFN  inhibitor)
    or SAHA  on levels of IL-6 mRNA., 'We observed a significant reduction of IL-6
    mRNA with both treatments, although the effect of SAHA treatment was even more
    intensive.', 'Since DCIS cocultured with adipocytes showed more aggressive phenotypes
    in regards to migration, we decided to determine if coculture of breast cancer
    cells with adipocytes will promote tumor growth in vivo.', 'After 3 days of coculture
    of DCIS cells with human dipocytes, DCIS cells were collected and then injected
    into mammary gland in 67-week-old immunodeficient Nu/Nu female mice.', DCIS cells
    cocultured with adipocytes remarkably increased the tumor volume compared with
    uncocultured DCIS cells after injection into mice., 'In addition, although the
    tumors were still present when cocultured DCIS cells were treated with SFN, the
    volumes of tumors were much lower than those from untreated DCIS cells at each
    time point under examination.', 'In particular, tumor growth was halted after
    4 weeks with SFN interference.', 'Therefore, our results strongly support that
    SFN treatment can suppress adipocyte-associated breast cancer growth in vivo.',
  The results of these experiments provide insight into the mechanisms underlying
    the SFN chemoprevention in breast cancer., 'We examined the impact of SFN on the
    self-renewing properties of adipose-derived MSCs by studying spheroid formation,
    which is a surrogate for stem cell growth and expansion.', We also compared the
    mRNA transcript levels of genes involved in MSC self-renewal  between control
    and SFN-treated cells., 'We found that SFN treatment results in a significantly
    increase in spheroid formation of MSCs and remarkable over-expression of OCT4,
    KLF4, and SOX2 mRNA levels when compared to untreated cells.', These results indicate
    that SFN treatment increases stem cell self-renewal through the upregulation of
    self-renewing genes., 'Next, we examined the effects of SFN treatment on the differentiation
    potential of preadipocytes.', 'We compared lipid droplet formation between SFN-treated
    and SFN-untreated cells using Oil Red O staining, and assessed the mRNA transcript
    levels of genes  involved in the differentiation process of both SFN-treated and
    SFN-untreated cells.', 'From these experiments, we observed a significant reduction
    of Oil Red O staining as well as a decrease in C/EBP transcript levels in SFN-treated
    cells compared to untreated cells.', These results confirm that SFN inhibits MSC
    differentiation to mature adipocytes., We performed coculture of adipocytes with
    breast cancer cells  to determine if adipocytes impact tumor cell migration in
    vitro., 'In our coculture experiments without SFN treatment, we found that adipocytes
    can increase DCIS and PT cell migration.', Both DCIS and PT cells exhibited a
    remarkable reduction of cell migration capacities in the presence of SFN treatment.,
  These findings highlight a mechanism of cross talking between the two cell populations
    that is sensitive to SFN intervention., We further explored this cell-to-cell
    communication between breast cancer cells and adipocytes through specific growth
    factors/cytokines that may be responsible for signaling within the tumor microenvironment.,
  'Using cytokine antibody arrays, we found a remarkable increase in the expression
    of several cytokines  in DCIS cells cocultured with adipocytes.', mRNA levels
    of IL-6 in cocultured DCIS were remarkably reduced in the presence of SFN or SAHA.,
  'After confirming that SFN treatment inhibits breast cancer cell migration and IL-6
    mRNA in cocultured experiments, we examined the impact of SFN treatment on breast
    cancer formation in a mouse model.', 'After injection of DCIS cells cocultured
    with adipocytes into mice, we observed that adipocyteDCIS cell coculture leads
    to a dramatic increase in tumor formation.', 'Finally, when adipocyteDCIS cell
    coculture was treated with SFN, we observed a reduction of tumor volume and inhibition
    of tumor growth after 4 weeks of SFN intervention.', These results demonstrate
    the antitumor activity of SFN in vivo., SFN represents a prime example of a cancer-preventive
    compound that can significantly hinder tumor development through intervention
    of the tumor microenvironment., 'Considering its low toxicity, SFN represents
    a very ideal candidate for the prevention of the early-stage breast cancer.',
  'Indeed, further studies are required to determine the subtype and stage of breast
    cancer to target.', 'This work was supported by ACS, NIH/NCI R01, and NIH.', The
