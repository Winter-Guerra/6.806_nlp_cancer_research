text: [Triple negative breast cancer  is a highly aggressive form of breast cancer
    resistant to many common treatments., 'In this study, we compared the effects
    of 12 phytochemical drugs on four cancer cell lines, and noticed that Cucurbitacin
    E  significantly inhibited TNBC cell growth by inducing cell cycle G2/M phase
    arrest and apoptosis.', 'CuE reduced expression of Cyclin D1, Survivin, XIAP,
    Bcl2, and Mcl-1 in MDA-MB-468 and SW527, and within MDA-MB-468, CuE significantly
    increased activation of JNK and inhibited activation of AKT and ERK.', 'Collectively,
    these results suggest that CuE may be a viable compound for developing novel TNBC

    describe a variety of diseases, each with markedly different treatment options
    and prognosis for survival.', 'While mortality rates from different forms of breast
    cancer have decreased on average over the last two decades, several variants remain
    resistant to common treatment options.', 'In particular, ER/PR/HER2 triple-negative
    breast cancer, which accounts for 1525% of breast tumors, often has poorest prognosis
    due to this particular cancers insensitivity to traditional endocrine therapies
    and HER2 targeted therapies.', 'Poor prognosis of TNBC is exacerbated by a high
    rate of relapse in the 35 years following treatment, as well as the aggressive
    nature of the cancer.', 'Though these factors have spurred a great deal of interest
    among oncologists, pathologists and medical researchers, few viable treatment
    options exist that have been shown to significantly improve survival rates for
    women with TNBC.', 'Given the state of research and prognosis of TNBC, there is
    a great need for novel therapeutics among the most promising are treatments derived
    from Cucurbitacins, which have been previously proposed to act as potential anti-tumor
    drugs.', 'Cucurbitacins are a class of highly oxidized tetracyclic triterpenes
    present in several plants used in traditional Chinese medicine treatments,which
    act by targeting the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, fibrous-actin,
    and cyclooxygenase-2.', 'The first tested cucurbitacins, CuB and CuE, were previously
    found to promote anti-cancer activities in different types of cancers including
    breast cancer.', 'For example, administration of CuB and CuE in combination appeared
    to inhibit growth of ER+ MCF-7 and ER MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cell lines.',
  'Later studies found that intraperitoneal administration of CuE significantly inhibited
    lung metastasis without affecting apoptosis or proliferation of 4T1 and MDA-MB-231
    breast cancer cells, and also blocked breast tumor cell migration and invasion
    by modulating actin polymerization.', 'More recently, CuE was reported to suppress
    growth of Bcap37 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells by inducing cell cycle arrest
    and apoptosis.', While each of these studies has yielded a variety of different
    findingsalbeit promising onesto date no study has thoroughly investigated the
    efficacy and functional mechanisms underlying CuEs different effects on TNBC.,
  'Generally speaking, the existing evidence of CuE potential effects as a novel anti-cancer
    drug suggests that it functions by inducing cancer cell G2/M arrest.', 'Previous
    studies found that CuE  increased the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors
    p21 and p27 in MDA-MB-231 cells, and that CuE  likewise up-regulated the expression
    of p53 and p21 proteins in the bladder cancer cell line T24.', 'Similarly, administration
    CuE at 0.51 M significantly inhibited the levels of pSTAT3 and CDK1, while when
    administration at 50 nM to human leukemia HL-60 cells it increased the levels
    of peIF2 and p21 while also decreasing the level of CDK1.', 'CuE also seems to
    induce apoptosis in several cancer cell lines , including the human oral squamous
    cell carcinoma cell line SAS, and the human breast cancer cell lines Bcap37 and
    MDA-MB-231.', The exact mechanisms of these effects are not entirely clear and
    seem to vary considerably., 'For example, in the bladder cancer cell line T24,
    CuE administered at 0.51 M induced apoptosis and triggered up-regulation of Fas/CD95,
    truncated BID, apoptosis-inducing factor, and sequential activation of caspase-8,
    caspase-9, and caspase-3.', 'CuE at 110 M has also consistently decreased levels
    of the anti-apoptotic proteins XIAP, Survivin, and Mcl-1, and increased levels
    of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax in human leukemia HL-60 cells.', The diversity
    of these results suggest that both mitochondrial  and death receptor  apoptotic
    signaling pathways play roles in CuE-induced apoptosis., 'To test the proposed
    functions of potential roles that CuE, as well as to investigate other potential
    roles of cucurbitacins, we extracted 12 different compounds for further testing:
    cucurbitacin E, kinoin B, and cucurbitacin L  from Hemsleya delavayi var.', 'yalungensis,
    endecaphyllacin A, 23,24-dihydrocucurbitacin D, cucurbitacin B, 23,24-dihydrocucurbitacin

    H. endecaphylla, 25-acetoxy-23,24-dihydrocucurbitacin F and B 23,24-dihydrocucurbitacin
    F from H. jinfushanensis.', 'After testing the potential activities of these compounds
    against several lines of cancerous cells, we found that administration of CuE
    resulted in marked anti-cancer activities in breast cancer lines, as well prostate
    and gastric cancer lines.', 'Specifically, the IC50 of CuE was about 1070 nM in
    five TNBC cell lines, and among the TNBC cell lines MAD-MB-468 and SW527, CuE
    significantly decreased cell viability, induced cell cycle G2/M phase arrest,
    and trigged apoptosis.', 'CuE at concentration of 0.2 M decreased the protein
    levels of CyclinD1, XIAP, Survivin, and Mcl-1.', Tubers of H. delavayi var., 'yalungensis
    were collected from Yalong, Sichuan Province, China, in 2006, and further study
    was then conducted at the Kunming Institute of Zoology and Kunming Institute of
    Botany.', 'A voucher specimen  was previously deposited at the State Key Laboratory
    of Phytochemistry and Plant Resources at the Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese
    Academy Sciences, before being identified by Prof. Wen-Jin Zhan, Penzhou Institute
    for Pharmaceutical Control, Sichuan.', 'To gather the necessary compounds for
    further testing, approximately 2.0 Kg of H. delavayi var.', 'yalungensisair-dried
    and powdered tubers underwent methanol under reflux  extraction, after which the
    resulting solution was filtered.', 'Once the combined filtrate was concentrated
    under vacuum, 317.7 g of residue was obtained, and then dissolved in 2L of water
    before being extracted with EtOAc  and n-butanol.The EtOAc extract  was subjected
    to silica gel column chromatography and eluted with a gradient system of CHCl3/MeOH  that
    yielded fractions IV monitored by TLC.', 'Fraction II  was repeatedly chromatographed
    over silica gel using CHCl3/2CO  as eluent, followed by a reversed-phase column  developing
    with aqueous MeOH  to yield 167 mg of CuE, 54 mg of kinoin B, and 32 mg of cucurbitacin

    and NCI-N87 cells were seeded into 96-well plates at 2, 000 cells/well.', 'After
    24 h, the cells were treated with 12 cucurbitacins  for 48 h, with DMSO serving
    as a negative control.', The cells were then fixed with 100 l 10% trichloro acetic

    to each well.', Optical densities at 530 nm were measured at a spectrophotometric
    plate reader., The cell viability values at different drug dosages were plotted
    in EXCEL and IC50 values were obtained from the graphs., DNA synthesis of MDA-MB-468

    the manufacturers protocols., 'Totally, we observed 10 fields randomly and counted
    the total number of cells and EdU positive cells respectively for each sample.',
  The EdU positive cell number was divided by total cell number for each field., The
    resulting average percentage from the 10 fields was calculated and then plotted
    for further analysis., 'Adherent and detached MDA-MB-468 and SW527 cells were
    digested, harvested, and washed twice with PBS.', Roughly 6105 cells were resuspended

    washed twice with BD Perm/Wash buffer  and incubated with 200 l dying buffer,
    incubated for 30 m at 37C in the dark.', The cells were then analyzed on an Accuri
    C6 flow cytometer., MDA-MB-468 and SW527 cells were treated with different concentrations
    of CuE for 24 h. Doxorubicin  was used as the positive control., The cells were
    stained with anti-Annexin V antibody  and 7-AAD  and then analyzed via flow cytometry.,
  'MDA-MB-468 and SW527 cells were treated with both different concentration of CuE
    or treated for different amounts of time, after which they were collected using
    a lysis buffer with a protease inhibitor cocktail.', 'The cell lysate was centrifuged
    and the resulting supernatant was collected, mixed with the sample buffer, and
    boiled for 5 m, after which the proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred
    onto polyvinylidene fluoride  membranes.', 'The membranes were incubated with

    identify anti-cancer compounds present in cucurbitacins, we treated four human
    cancer cell lines  with 12 individual cucurbitacins at concentration of 10 M for
    two days, and then measured the resulting cell viability via SRB assays.', 'Of
    the 12 tested compounds, CuE and four other compounds  resulted in dramatic reduction
    in cell viability in each of the four cancer cell lines when compared to the control
    DMSO.', We selected these five compounds with different dosages and treated them

    effects in terms of IC50 in the cancer cell lines., The compound appeared to have
    similar effects in osteosarcoma MG63 and TNBC MDA-MB-231 cell lines., 'Given the
    strong effects of CuE, we further tested it against five TNBC cell lines  and
    found that CuE inhibited the growth of all five TNBC lines in a dose-dependent
    manner, with the IC50 being about 1070 nM.', 'Overall, the MDA-MB-468 line appeared
    to be the most sensitive TNBC cell line in regards to the effects of CuE.', 'To
    investigate whether CuE inhibits cell proliferation in TNBC cell lines, we used
    an EdU assay to measure the DNA synthesis.', Results showed that CuE dramatically
    inhibited DNA synthesis in both MDA-MB-468 and SW527 cell lines in a dosage dependent

    test whether CuE modulates the cell cycle among TNBC cells, we treated MDA-MB-468
    and SW527 cells with CuE at several different dosages  for 24 h, after which we
    measured cell cycle distribution.', 'Results showed that administration of CuE
    significantly increased the percentage of cells in the G2/M phase in a dosage
    dependent manner in both MDA-MB-468 and SW527 cell lines, with the G2/M arrest
    induced by CuE reached its peak at 100 nM.', Further increases in dosages of CuE  did
    not appear to significantly increase the percentage of cells in the G2/M phase
    in both MDA-MB-468 and SW527 lines., Figure 3., CuE induces cell cycle G2/M arrest
    in MDA-MB-468 and SW527 TNBC cell lines., A. MDA-MB-468 and SW527 cells were treated
    with CuE  for 24 h. Cells were stained with PI and analyzed by flow cytometry.,

    24 h treatment with 200 nM of CuE, MDA-MB-468 and SW527 cells became round, detached,
    and formed apoptotic bodies, indicating that the cancerous cells underwent apoptosis
    following CuE treatment.', We further measured apoptosis of MDA-MB-468 and SW527
    cells via Annexin V/7-AAD staining and flow cytometry with doxorubicin serving
    as a positive control., 'Administration of CuE  was found to significantly increase
    the Annexin V positive apoptotic cells in both MDA-MB-468 and SW527 lines,and
    also induce the cleavage of Caspase-3 and PARP in both cell lines.', A., Cell

  'A. MDA-MB-468 and SW527 cells were treated with CuE  for 24 h. Cell lysate were
    collected for WB, to detect PARP, cleaved Caspase-3, Survivin, Mcl-1, XIAP, Bcl-2,
    Bcl-xL, Cyclin B1, Cyclin D1, Cyclin E1, p21, and p27.', -actin and GAPDH were

    24 h. pSTAT3, total STAT3, pAKT, total AKT, pJNK, total JNK, p-c-Jun, total c-Jun,
    pERK and total ERK were examined by WB.', GAPDH was used as a loading control.,
  'After noting that CuE induced cell cycle G2/M arrest and apoptosis, we further
    examined the protein levels of both the cell cycle and apoptosis regulators using
    WB.', 'In both MDA-MB-468 and SW527 cells, CuE  treatment for 24 h dramatically
    decreased the protein levels of Cyclin D1, but not Cyclin B1 or Cyclin E1.', 'Likewise,
    within both lines, CuE  did not increase the protein levels of p21 and p27.',
  'Concurrently, CuE administration dramatically decreased the levels of several anti-apoptotic
    proteins, including Survivin, Mcl-1, XIAP, and Bcl-2, though not Bcl-XL.', 'Given
    the effects of CuE on MDA-MB-468 and SW527 cells, we further investigate whether
    CuE actually modulates the activities of STAT3, AKT, ERK, and JNK in these two
    cell lines.', 'MDA-MB-468 was the most sensitive TNBC cell line to CuE administration
    with dosages of 100200 nM decreasing levels of pSTAT3, pERK, pAKT and total AKT.',
  'Moreover, in this cell line, the administration of CuE also increased levels of
    pJNK and p-c-Jun.', 'However, in SW527 cells, we did not detect the pSTAT3, pAKT
    and total AKT proteins, and CuE did not appear to dramatically change the levels
    of pERK, pJNK and p-c-Jun.', 'Despite numerous advances in cancer treatments,
    the resistance of certain forms breast cancer, especially TNBC, the lack of effective
    treatments has prompted a great deal of research into novel anti-cancer drugs
    derived from natural compounds.', 'The cucurbitacin family has been an attractive
    target in this search, as they have been previously reported to exhibit strong
    anti-cancer effects in several different types of cancers,.', 'Within cucurbitacins,
    both CuB and CuE were found to exert a cytotoxicity effect in a number of breast
    cancer cell lines, including MDA-MB-231, ZR-75-1, BT474, MCF7, and SKBR3 .', 'Though
    these results were promising, little research has been done to delineate the underlying
    effects of CuE on TNBC.', 'In this study, we tested 12 cucurbitacins from three
    Hemsleya species and compared their cytotoxic effects on four different types
    of cancer cell lines.', 'Our results showed that CuE exerts the most potent anti-cancer
    effects, with the administration of CuE significantly decreased cell viability
    in five TNBC cell lines at low concentrations.', 'Furthermore, CuE induced cell
    cycle G2/M arrest and apoptosis in MDA-MB-468 and SW527 TNBC cell lines.', 'Finally,
    CuE modulated cell cycle protein Cyclin D1, anti-apoptotic proteins Survivin,
    Mcl-1, XIAP, and Bcl-2, as well as several signaling pathways such as pSTAT3,
    pERK, pJNK, and pAKT in the most sensitive TNBC cell line.', 'Our findings strongly
    suggest that CuE may be a promising candidate developing novel TNBC therapeutics,
    though we also noted that four other cucurbitacin compounds  also exhibited strong
    cytotoxic effects on six cancer cell lines.', 'Previous studies reported that
    CuB could induce apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells, hepatocellular carcinoma
    cells, melanoma cells, breast cancer cells, colon cancer cells, and laryngeal
    squamous cell carcinoma.', 'However, the anti-tumor activities of our other tested
    compounds CuL, 23, 24-dihydro CuD, and 24-acetoxy-23, 24-dihydro CuF have not
    been thoroughly examined.', 'Our results suggest that these natural products induce
    anti-tumor activity in different types of cancers, potentially indicating they
    may be useful targets for further research into novel therapeutics even though
    their anti-cancer effects were not as dramatic as those of CuE.', A key hurdle
    in developing novel cancer treatments is elucidating the underlying molecular
    mechanisms for compounds that exhibit anti-cancer effects., 'The current study
    greatly extends our understanding of the molecular mechanism by which CuE inhibits
    TNBC, wherein CuE induced cell cycle G2/M arrest in MDA-MB-468 and SW527 cells.',
  'Earlier reports showed that CuE caused T24 bladder cancer cell G2/M arrest through
    STAT3/p53/p21 signaling pathway, but the functional concentration for CuE affecting
    cells in the T24 line was as dosages of 0.51 M. Similarly, administration of 10
    M of CuE caused an increased expression of p21 and p27 in MDA-MB-231 cells.',
  'Curiously, we observed no such up-regulation of p21 and p27 in MDA-MB-468 and SW527
    cells when using concentrations of 200 nM of CuE.', 'Though there may confounding
    factors, it seems that the expression change of p21 and p27 by CuE may in part
    be due to a dosage or cell line dependent effect.', 'Indeed, we observed a down-regulation
    of Cyclin D1 by CuE in both MDA-MB-468 and SW527 cells.', 'However, Cyclin B1
    plays more important role in G2/M phases than Cyclin D1 does.', 'In our study,
    CuE did not significantly down-regulate the expression of Cyclin B1 in MDA-MB-468
    and SW527 cells, suggesting that CuE may cause G2/M arrest through other proteins
    in addition to Cyclin D1.', 'In addition to the noted effect of G2/M cell cycle
    arrest, CuE  also induced apoptosis in MDA-MB-468 and SW527 cells.', 'In previous
    studies, CuE  inhibited the pSTAT3 and induced apoptosis in human breast cancer
    cell lines Bcap37 and MDA-MB-231  and decreased the levels of the anti-apoptotic
    proteins XIAP, Survivin, and Mcl-1, and increased the level of Bax in human leukemia
    HL-60 cells.', 'Moreover, higher dosages of CuE  induced the up-regulation of
    Fas/CD95, truncated BID, AIF, and sequential activation of caspase-8, caspase-9,
    and caspase-3 in T24 bladder cancer cells.', 'In this study, we demonstrated that
    CuE at somewhat lower concentrations  decreased the expression levels of Survivin,
    XIAP, Bcl2, and Mcl-1 in MDA-MB-468 and SW527 cells.', 'Considering both our current
    results and those from previous studies, it is plausible to assume that CuE modulates
    the expression of cell cycle and apoptosis regulators by interfering with key
    cancer related signaling pathways, such as Jak-STAT, PI3K-AKT, and Raf-MAPK.',
  We demonstrated that CuE  inhibited the pSTAT3 in MDA-MB-468 cells., Similar studies
    found that CuE  consistently inhibited pSTAT3 in the PANC-1 pancreatic cancer
    cell line  and the ES-2 ovarian cancer cell line., 'Additionally, CuE  blocked
    VEGFR2-mediated Jak2-STAT3 and pERK signaling pathways in HUVEC cells.', 'For
    the first time, we noticed that CuE  dramatically decreased the levels of pERK,
    pAKT, and total AKT in MDA-MB-468 cells.', 'Similarly, CuB  inhibited 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol
    13-acetate  induced pERK and pAKT in HepG2 cells.', 'We also found that CuE  dramatically
    increased the levels of pJNK and p-c-Jun in MDA-MB-468 cells, though CuE has never
    previously been reported to activate the JNK-c-Jun pathway.', CuB  likewise activated
    pJNK and p-c-Jun in U87 and T98G glioblastoma cell lines  and CuI  activated pJNK
    and p-c-Jun in B leukemic cells., 'Taken together, these results suggest that
    the STAT3, ERK, AKT, and JNK/c-Jun signaling pathways may be targets for CuE in
    a subtype of TNBC.', 'In conclusion, our study on the 12 cucurbitacins found that
    CuE was the most potent cytotoxic compound among five active compounds that were
    shown to exert anti-cancer effects on several different cancer cell lines.', CuE
    decreased cell viability in multiple TNBC cell lines and also induced G2/M cell
    cycle arrest and apoptosis in MDA-MB-468 and SW527 TNBC cell lines., 'The mechanism
    by which CuE inhibits TNBC may potentially be caused by down-regulation of Cyclin
    D1, Survivin, XIAP, Bcl2, and Mcl-1, the inactivation of STAT3, AKT and ERK, and
    the activation of JNK.', 'Given the possibilities underpinning these different
    results, there are many potential mechanisms or effects of CuE and the other active
    compounds we tested that must be examined further.', Such investigations may yield
    new avenues in the development of novel cancer treatments., 'However, our findings
    strongly support CuE as one of the most promising target for further investigation
    and development of novel therapeutics, especially towards TNBC.', We wish to thank
