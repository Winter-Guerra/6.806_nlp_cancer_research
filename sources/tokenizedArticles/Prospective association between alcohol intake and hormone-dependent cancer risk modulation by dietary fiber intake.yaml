text: ['Background: Alcohol intake is associated with increased circulating concentrations
    of sex hormones, which in turn may increase hormone-dependent cancer risk.', 'This
    association may be modulated by dietary fiber intake, which has been shown to
    decrease steroid hormone bioavailability.', 'However, this potential modulation
    has not been investigated in any prospective cohort.']
