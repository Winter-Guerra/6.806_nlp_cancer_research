text: ['Daily consumption of an antioxidant-rich leafy vegetable mix  was assessed
    for beneficial effects on plasma lipid profiles, tissue lipid peroxidation, and
    oxidative DNA damage in C57BL/6J mice fed a high fat and high cholesterol diet  for
    4 weeks.', 'The LVM contained beet leaf, angelica, red leaf lettuce, dandelion,
    green cos lettuce, lollo rosso, romaine lettuce, scotch kale, and red kale.',
  The mice  were randomly divided into either the control  or the LVM  groups after
    a 1-week acclimation., 'Lipid peroxidation as measured by thiobarbituric acid-reactive
    substances in the plasma, liver, heart, and kidney was significantly lower.',
  Antioxidants  and antioxidant enzyme activities  were improved in mice fed LVM diet.,
  'In the comet assay, tail extent moment, olive tail moment, and tail length were
    significantly less in the hepatocyte and lymphocyte DNA of the LVM group, indicating
    the beneficial effect of LVM on the resistance of hepatocytes and lymphocytes
    DNA to oxidative damage.', Findings from the present study suggest that dietary
    supplementation with LVM may be useful for protecting cells from lipid peroxidation
    and oxidative DNA damage.]
