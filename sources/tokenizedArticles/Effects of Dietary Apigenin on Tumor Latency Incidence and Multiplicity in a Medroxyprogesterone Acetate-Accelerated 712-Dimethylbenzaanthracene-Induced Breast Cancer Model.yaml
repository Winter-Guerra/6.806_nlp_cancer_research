text: [Medroxyprogesterone acetate  is a synthetic progestin commonly administered
    to postmenopausal women for hormone replacement therapy and has been associated
    with increased risk of breast cancer., 'MPA has been shown to accelerate the development
    of mammary tumors in a 7,12-dimethylbenzanthracene -induced breast cancer animal
    model.', 'Previously, we have shown that intraperitoneally administered apigenin
    effectively treated and prevented the progression of MPA-accelerated breast cancer
    in DMBA-induced and xenograft mammary cancer models.', Here we used the DMBA model
    to examine the chemopreventive effect of dietary apigenin against MPA-accelerated
    tumors with 3 different levels of apigenin  incorporated into a phytoestrogen-free
    diet., 'Results showed that 0.1% dietary apigenin reduced MPA-dependent tumor
    incidence; however, the same dietary level increased tumor multiplicity in animals
    that developed tumors.', 'Neither 0.02% nor 0.5% dietary apigenin reduced MPA-dependent
    tumor incidence or latency, and tumor multiplicity increased significantly in
    response to 0.5% apigenin.', 'These results contrast with previous chemopreventive
    effects observed when apigenin was administered intraperitoneally, suggesting
    that route of administration may influence its action.', 'Consequently, until
    further research clarifies the effect of dietary apigenin on progestin-accelerated
    mammary tumors, caution should be exercised when considering the flavonoid as
    a dietary supplement for preventing hormone-dependent breast cancer.']
