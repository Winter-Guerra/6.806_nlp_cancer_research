text: ['Propolis, a natural product collected from plants by honey bees, is commonly
    used in folk medicines.', Endoplasmic reticulum  stress is known to induce apoptosis
    through the induction of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein., 'Here,
    we investigated whether ethanol extracts of propolis and caffeic acid phenethyl
    ester  induce apoptosis, mitochondrial dysfunction, and ER stress in human breast
    cancer MCF-7 cells and human fibroblasts.', 'Among several ethanol extracts of
    propolis and CAPE, Brazilian red propolis  significantly reduced MCF-7 cell viability
    through the induction of mitochondrial dysfunction, caspase-3 activity, and DNA
    fragmentation but did not affect those of fibroblasts.', 'Moreover, treatment
    with BRP significantly induced CHOP expression in MCF-7 cells compared to fibroblasts.',
  'Further, pretreatment with a chemical chaperone, 4-phenylbutyric acid, suppressed
    BRP-triggered MCF-7 cell death.', 'Overall, we revealed that an ethanol extract
    of BRP induces MCF-7 cell apoptosis through, at least in part, ER stress-related
    signaling.', Propolis is a natural product made by honey bees from the gum of
    various plants., 'Accumulated evidence using high-performance liquid chromatography  and
    gas chromatographymass spectrometry has demonstrated that more than 300 compounds,
    including flavonoids, amino acids, and fatty acids, are present in propolis.',
  'Propolis has been used in folk medicines and has been reported to have various
    biological properties, such as anticancer, antiviral, antioxidative, and antibacterial.',
  It is well-recognized that the main components of propolis are due to the origin
    of plants., 'Indeed, it has been reported that Chinese propolis  contains pinocembrin,
    chrysin, and caffeic acid phenethyl ester  at high concentrations, but Brazilian
    propolis  contains artepillin C and baccharin, instead of the above compounds.',
  'Recently, red propolis samples were collected in northern regions of Brazil and
    classified as a new type of BP, and it has been reported that Brazilian red propolis  contains
    daizein, biochanin A, quercetin, and naringenin.', 'Therefore, propolis-derived
    pharmacological activities vary according to the geographical and botanical origin.',
  'Recently, it has been reported that the ethanol extract of BRP promotes adipocyte
    differentiation through peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor- activation.',
  'Among these several propolis compounds, artepillin C and CAPE are known to show
    antiproliferative and anticancer properties and to induce apoptosis.', 'It is
    well-recognized that apoptosis is characterized by the activation of caspase signaling
    following mitochondrial dysfunction, such as increased pro-apoptotic protein Bax
    as well as decreased anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-xL and Bcl-2.', 'Moreover, anticancer
    properties are related to the activation of p53 and p38 mitogen-activated protein
    kinase and cell cycle arrest.', 'Recently, it has been recognized that endoplasmic
    reticulum  stress is positively related to the exacerbation of several kinds of
    diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, retinopathy, and metabolic disorders, through
    the promotion of pro-apoptotic processes.', ER stress-derived apoptosis is considered
    to be induced by the enhancement of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous
    protein., 'Although propolis extracts and CAPE, a main component of CP, are known
    to induce apoptosis in human breast cancer MCF-7 cells through the inhibition
    of nuclear factor-B, the involvement of mitochondrial dysfunction and ER stress-related
    signaling in the BRP-induced apoptosis remains unknown.', 'Ethanol extracts of
    CP, BRP, and BP, provided by Api Co., Ltd., were obtained by the addition of 3.5
    volumes of 95% ethanol to 50 g of propolis at room temperature for 24 h and filtration.',
  There major constituents and amounts were previously determined by HPLC and shown
    in Table 1., 'Human breast cancer MCF-7 cells and human fibroblasts were grown
    in Dulbeccos modified Eagles medium  supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100
    units/mL penicillin, and 100 g/mL streptomycin.', 'Human prostate cancer LNCaP
    cells and human breast cancer ZR-75-1 cells were grown in RPMI1640 supplemented
    with 10% FCS, 100 units/mL penicillin, and 100 g/mL streptomycin.', 'The cells
    were kept in an atmosphere of 5% CO2/95% air at 37 C. The cells were grown to
    confluence in a 96-well microplate  for measurement of cell viability or a 6 cm
    culture dish  for others and treated with the test reagents, including propolis
    ethanol extracts, CAPE, daidzein, and biochanin A. Pretreatment with 4-phenylbutyric
    acid  and Z-VAD-FMK  was added 1 h prior to the addition of the ethanol extract
    of propolis.', 'The cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline  and
    then used for measurements of cell viability, determination of apoptosis, reverse
    transcriptional-polymerase chain reaction  analysis, and western blotting.', 'A
    3--2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide  assay was used to estimate the cytotoxicity
    of ethanol extracts or constituents of propolis.', 'After treatment of these cells
    with propolis, the culture medium was aspirated and the cells were added to 110
    L of 10% FCSDMEM containing MTT  and were then incubated for 3 h at 37 C in a
    humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2/95% air.', 'After incubation, the cells were added
    to 100 L isopropanol containing 0.04 N HCl and were then mixed thoroughly to dissolve
    the MTT formazan.', 'Finally, the MTT formazen was measured at 595 nm with a reference
    wavelength of 655 nm.', 'After treatment of MCF-7 cells and fibroblasts with ethanol
    extracts of propolis and CAPE, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and
    collected by centrifugation at 550g for 10 min.', The pellets were lysed on ice
    for 10 min in lysis buffer., Caspase-3 activity was then assayed using an Apopcyto
    caspase-3 colorimetric assay kit according to the protocol of the manufacturer.,
  'After treatment of MCF-7 cells and fibroblasts with ethanol extracts of propolis
    and CAPE, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed on ice for 20
    min in lysis buffer.', The lysates were centrifuged at 13000g for 10 min., 'The
    supernatants were deprotenized by digestion with 200 g/mL proteinase K at 50 C
    for 30 min, extracted once with an equal volume of phenol/chloroform/isoamylalcohol
    mixture, and then precipitated with 2.5 volumes of ethanol in the presence of
    0.3 M sodium acetate.', 'After centrifugation at 17700g for 10 min, the pellets
    were washed with 70% ethanol and resuspended in 20 L of 10 mM Tris-HCl at pH 8.0
    containing 1 mM EDTA and 10 g/mL RNase.', 'The DNA solution was incubated at 37
    C for 1 h, and 5 g DNA was separated on 1.5%  agarose gel, stained with ethidium
    bromide, and photographed.', 'The cDNA was prepared, and RT-PCR was performed
    by the methods described in our previous report.', The primer sequences and PCR
    conditions used in this study were shown in Table 2., 'These PCR products were
    loaded onto a 2%  agarose gel for electrophoresis, and densitometric analysis
    of the PCR products was performed with Multi Gauge, version 3.0.', Whole cell
    extracts were prepared in lysis buffer as described previously., Extracts containing
    20 g of protein were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  on
    12%  polyacrylamide gels followed by transferring electrophoretically onto polyvinylidene
    difluoride  membranes., 'Subsequently, the membranes were incubated with the respective
    specific primary antibodies.', 'The blots were incubated with biotin-conjugated
    goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibody, followed by incubation with ABC reagents.',
  'Finally, the bands were detected using SuperSignal West Pico  and imaged using
    a LAS-3000 UV mini.', Data are expressed as the means  standard deviation  of
    three independent experiments., 'Statistical evaluation of the data was performed
    using analysis of variation, followed by post-hoc Bonferroni tests.', A p value
    less than 0.05 was considered significant., 'Propolis, a natural product made
    by honey bees, is known to have several chemical components and to show biological
    properties, such as antiviral, antibacterial, antioxidative, and anticancer.',
  'We previously reported that ethanol extracts of CP, BRP, and BP show antioxidative
    property and suppress reactive-oxygen-species-derived cell death.', 'On the other
    hand, it has been reported that CAPE has anticancer properties by inhibiting NF-B
    and activating caspase and Fas signaling in human breast cancer MCF-7 cells; however,
    whether an ethanol extract of BRP has anticancer properties remains unclear.',
  'Accordingly, we first investigated the effect of ethanol extracts of CP, BRP, and
    BP and CAPE on the cell viability of human breast cancer MCF-7 cells and human
    fibroblasts.', 'As shown in Figure 1A, ethanol extracts of CP and BRP and CAPE
    significantly decreased MCF-7 cell viability in a dose-dependent manner but an
    ethanol extract of BP did not affect MCF-7 cell viability.', 'On the other hand,
    these extracts did not induce cell death in fibroblasts, suggesting that ethanol
    extracts of propolis and CAPE induce cell death only in MCF-7 cells.', 'Because
    it is well-recognized that the main components of propolis are due to the origin
    of plants, differences in the contained components were considered to be associated
    with differences in the induction of MCF-7 cell death.', Figure 1., 'Effect of
    ethanol extracts of CP, BRP, and BP and CAPE on cell viability in  MCF-7 cells
    and  fibroblasts.', 'MCF-7 cells and fibroblasts were treated with the indicated
    concentrations of ethanol extracts of propolis and CAPE for 24 h. After treatment,
    cell viability was measured..', 'The activation of caspase-signaling pathways,
    such as caspase-3, caspase-6, caspase-8, and caspase-9, is known to be closely
    related to apoptotic processes.', 'Indeed, it has been reported that propolis-induced
    apoptosis in MCF-7 cells and human osteogenic carcinoma SAOS-2 cells is mediated
    by the induction of caspase signaling.', 'In this study, treatment with ethanol
    extracts of CP and BRP significantly induced caspase-3 activities in MCF-7 cells
    compared to fibroblasts.', 'Moreover, especially in BRP-treated MCF-7 cells, DNA
    fragmentation was observed.', 'On the other hand, ethanol extracts of propolis
    and CAPE did not induce caspase-3 activities and DNA fragmentation in fibroblasts.',
  'We next investigated the involvement of caspase signaling in ethanol extracts on
    BRP-induced apoptosis using Z-VAD-FMK, a pan-caspase inhibitor.', 'Pretreatment
    with Z-VAD-FMK significantly suppressed cell death and DNA fragmentation induced
    by an ethanol extract of BRP, suggesting that caspase signaling plays a pivotal
    role in apoptosis induced by an ethanol extract of BRP.', Figure 2., Ethanol extract
    of BRP induces apoptosis in MCF-7 cells but not in fibroblasts., 'MCF-7 cells
    and fibroblasts were treated with 20 g/mL CP, BRP, and BP or 2 M CAPE for 24 h.
    After treatment,  caspase-3 activities were measured and  DNA fragmentation was
    determined.. MCF-7 cells were pretreated with  or without  10 M Z-VAD-FMK  for
    1 h and then treated with  or without  20 g/mL BRP for 24 h. After treatment,  cell
    viability was measured and  DNA fragmentation was determined..


    Mitochondrial dysfunction, such as increased pro-apoptotic protein Bax as well
    as decreased anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-xL and Bcl-2, is considered to be closely
    associated with the induction of apoptosis.', We therefore investigated whether
    an ethanol extract of BRP led to changes in the expression of pro- and anti-apoptotic
    proteins in MCF-7 cells and fibroblasts., 'As shown in Figure 3, the expression
    of Bax mRNA in MCF-7 cells was bell-shaped, whereas Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 mRNA in MCF-7
    cells were decreased.', 'Moreover, the reduction of Bcl-2 by 20 g/mL BRP was determined
    as early as 12 h, reaching 21% by 24 h ; however, in fibroblasts, treatment with
    BRP did not affect these expressions, suggesting that the significant induction
    of Bax and reduction of Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 might be involved in BRP-induced apoptosis.',
  Figure 3., Ethanol extract of BRP induces mitochondrial dysfunction in MCF-7 cells
    but not in fibroblasts., 'MCF-7 cells and fibroblasts were treated with the indicated
    concentrations of an ethanol extract of BRP for 24 h. After treatment, Bax, Bcl-xL,
    and Bcl-2 mRNA were measured.', RT-PCR data were normalized using -actin levels..,
  It is well-known that ER stress contributes to the exacerbation of several diseases
    through the induction of apoptosis., 'Under ER stress conditions, cells trigger
    a set of pathways known as the unfolded protein response, which is mediated by
    the upregulation of chaperones, such as glucose-regulated protein 78 kDa, GRP94,
    and oxygen-regulated protein 150 kDa.', 'On the other hand, pro-apoptotic pathways
    are also activated and mediated by the induction of CHOP.', 'It has been reported
    that propolis suppressed ER stress-induced cell death in neuronal cells, suggesting
    the utility of propolis against ER stress-triggered disturbances of tissue and
    cell homeostasis; however, in this study, we observed that treatment with an ethanol
    extract of BRP significantly induced the expression of CHOP in MCF-7 cells compared
    to that in fibroblasts, suggesting that ER stress may be involved in BRP-induced
    apoptosis in MCF-7 cells.', 'Moreover, pretreatment with 4-phenylbutyric acid,
    an ER stress inhibitor, partially but significantly suppressed the ethanol extract
    of BRP-triggered cell death  and induction of CHOP in MCF-7 cells.', These results
    indicate that ER stress plays a major role in the ethanol extract of BRP-triggered
    apoptosis., Figure 4., Involvement of ER stress in the ethanol extract of BRP-induced
    apoptosis in MCF-7 cells., MCF-7 cells  and fibroblasts  were treated with the  indicated
    concentrations of an ethanol extract of BRP for 24 h or  20 g/mL BRP for the indicated
    hours., 'After treatment,  CHOP mRNA and  protein levels were measured.', RT-PCR
    data were normalized using -actin levels., 'MCF-7 cells were pretreated with the  indicated
    concentrations of PBA or  with  or without  2 mM PBA for 1 h and then treated
    with  or without  20 g/mL BRP for 24 h. After treatment,  cell viability and  CHOP
    mRNA were measured.', RT-PCR data were normalized using -actin levels., 'MCF-7
    cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of daidzein  or biochanin
    A  for 24 h. After treatment,  cell viability and  CHOP mRNA were measured.',
  RT-PCR data were normalized using -actin levels., 'Next, we investigated the effect
    of daidzein and biochanin A on MCF-7 cell apoptosis because these compounds are
    reported to be main constituents of the ethanol extract of BRP.', Treatment with
    daidzein and biochanin A significantly reduced cell viability., 'Moreover, we
    also determined the induction of CHOP when MCF-7 cells were treated with daidzein
    and biochanin A.', 'Recently, it has been reported that propolis activates estrogen-receptor-dependent
    signaling.', 'Therefore, we next investigated the involvement of estrogen receptor
    signaling in the viability of MCF-7 cells  in comparison to those of human prostate
    cancer LNCaP cells  and human breast cancer ZR-75-1 cells.', 'Treatment with ethanol
    extracts of propolis induced cell death in LNCaP cells, but not in ZR-75-1 cells.',
  These results suggested the possibility that ethanol extracts of propolis-induced
    cell death might depend upon estrogen receptor -derived signaling., 'However,
    additional studies will be necessary to determine the exact molecular mechanisms
    governing the relationship between estrogen receptor-derived signaling and MCF-7
    cell apoptosis.', Figure 5., 'Effect of ethanol extracts of CP, BRP, and BP on
    cell viability in  LNCaP cells and  ZR-75-1 cells.', 'These cells were treated
    with the indicated concentrations of ethanol extracts of propolis for 24 h. After
    treatment, cell viability was measured.', 'In this study, we investigated whether
    an ethanol extract of BRP induces MCF-7 cell apoptosis and first revealed that
    apoptosis was, at least in part, mediated by ER stress-related signaling.', 'Although
    these results were in contrast to previous reports that mentioned that propolis
    acts as an inhibitor of ER stress, a property that significantly induces ER stress
    only in cancer cells might contribute to the development of novel anticancer drugs.',
