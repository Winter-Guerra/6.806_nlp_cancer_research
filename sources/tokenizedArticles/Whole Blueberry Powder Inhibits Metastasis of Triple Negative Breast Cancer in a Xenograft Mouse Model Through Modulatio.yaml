text: [Triple negative breast cancer  comprises approximately 15% of breast cancers
    and is associated with a poor prognosis., Many patients with TNBC relapse quickly
    and commonly develop metastases., 'There are no individualized targeted adjuvant
    or induction treatments for TNBC, and the current treatments are highly toxic.',
  Development of chemoprevention methods using natural products would be beneficial
    to patients at risk of TNBC., 'To investigate the inhibitory effect of blueberries
    on inflammation-induced TNBC and identify the mechanism underlying modulation
    of inflammatory proteins by blueberries, we induced a proinflammatory microenvironment
    by feeding female MDA-MB-231 tumor-bearing mice a high fat western diet  with
    5% whole blueberry powder  and studied the effect on tumor formation and metastasis.',
  'We showed that mice fed a BB diet had significantly smaller tumors, less ulceration,
    and significantly less metastasis to the inguinal lymph nodes than mice fed a
    W diet.', 'In BB-fed mice, serum levels of specific antiinflammatory cytokines
    were increased and specific cytokine expression was also altered.', 'Together,
    these results suggest that blueberries may inhibit TNBC and TNBC-related metastasis
    by reducing inflammation via specific cytokine-driven pathways and thus reduce
    tumor growth and metastasis.']
