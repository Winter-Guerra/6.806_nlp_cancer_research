text: ['Previous studies on a murine model have demonstrated that the administration
    of Lactobacillus helveticus and Lactobacillus casei inhibits the development of
    fibrosarcoma and colon carcinoma, respectively.', The aim of this work was to
    study the beneficial effects of the consumption of milk fermented by L. helveticus
    on a murine model for mammary carcinoma., Female BALB/c mice were challenged by
    a single subcutaneous injection of tumoral cells  in the left mammary gland.,
  'Prior to tumour injection, mice were fed for two, five or seven consecutive days
    with fermented milk.', 'The following factors were monitored for 2 months: rate
    of tumour development, histological studies, apoptosis, phagocytic index, peritoneal
    macrophages, determination of -glucuronidase enzyme in peritoneal macrophages,
    determination of -interferon  and tumour necrosis factor-  in blood serum, determination
    of CD4+, CD8+, interleukin-6, IL-10, TNF- and INF by immunoperoxidase, and measurement
    of -glucuronidase activity in intestinal fluid.', 'The administration of L. helveticus
    delayed the development of the tumour in all cases, a 2- or 7-day feeding period
    being most effective.', This work demonstrates that milk fermented with L. helveticus
    decreases the growth rate of mammary tumours., 'The effect was mediated by increased
    apoptosis and decreased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, in particular
    IL-6, implicated in oestrogen synthesis.']
