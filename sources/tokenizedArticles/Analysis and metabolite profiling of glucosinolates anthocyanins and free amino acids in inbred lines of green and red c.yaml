text: ['We profiled and quantified glucosinolates, anthocyanins and free amino acids
    in thirty-seven inbred lines green and red cabbage.', 'Analysis of these distinct
    cabbages revealed the presence of 8 GSLs, 13 anthocyanins and 12 free amino acids.',
  GSL contents were varied among the different lines of cabbage., 'The maximum levels
    of glucoraphanin  and glucobrassicin  were found in FX 1-28 and FX 1-32 lines,
    respectively.', Total GSLs in red cabbage lines were 50% higher than those of
    green cabbage., 'Anthocyanin contents in red cabbage were ranged from 4.11 to
    6.81 mg/g DW in FX 2-3 and FX 1-34 lines, respectively.', 'Among the 13 anthocyanins,
    both cyanidin 3- diglucoside-5-glucoside and cyanidin 3- diglucoside-5-glucoside
    levels were the highest amounts.', 'The amounts of total free amino acids were
    ranged from 523.5 to 1308 mg/100 g fresh weight  in green cabbage and 484.8 to
    1271 in red cabbage, respectively.', 'In red cabbage lines, 9.4% of the total
    free amino acids accounted essential amino acids such as valine, threonine, isoleucine,
    leucine and lysine.', 'Thus, the amounts of GSLs, anthocyanins, and amino acids
    varied widely, and the variations in these compounds between the lines of cabbage
    were significant.']
