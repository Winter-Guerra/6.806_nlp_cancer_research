text: [This study investigated dietary fiber intake in association with serum estrogen
    levels in naturally postmenopausal Latina women with a wide range of fiber intake.,
  'Estrone, estradiol, and sex-hormone-binding globulin  were measured in 242 women.',
  'Associations between estrogen levels and intake of dietary fiber, including insoluble
    and soluble fractions, quantified from a food frequency questionnaire, were examined.',
  The biomarker enterolactone was also measured., 'After adjustment for age, weight,
    and other nondietary factors, dietary fiber intake was inversely associated with
    E1 and E2; there was a 22% and 17% decrease  among subjects in the highest quintile
    of intake compared with the lowest.', Fitting dietary fiber together with soluble
    and insoluble nonstarch polysaccharides  showed a much greater decrease in E1
    and E2  while increased soluble NSP intake showed increases in E1 and E2., 'Two
    foods, avocado and grapefruit, showed significant positive associations with E1.',
  This study suggests that different components of dietary fiber may have very significant
    different effects on serum estrogen levels., The suggestive findings relating
    increased estrogen levels to avocado and grapefruit intakes need confirmation.]
