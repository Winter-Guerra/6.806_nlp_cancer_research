text: ['Despite the widespread use of antiemetics, nausea continues to be reported
    by over 70% of patients receiving chemotherapy.', 'In this double blind, multicenter
    trial, we randomly assigned 744 cancer patients to four arms: 1) placebo, 2) 0.5
    g ginger, 3) 1.0 g ginger, or 4) 1.5 g ginger.', Nausea occurrence and severity
    were assessed at a baseline cycle and the two following cycles during which patients
    were taking their assigned study medication., All patients received a 5-HT3 receptor
    antagonist antiemetic on Day 1 of all cycles., Patients took three capsules of
    ginger  or placebo twice daily for 6 days starting 3 days before the first day
    of chemotherapy., Patients reported the severity of nausea on a 7-point rating
    scale  for Days 14 of each cycle., The primary outcomes were to determine the
    dose and efficacy of ginger at reducing the severity of chemotherapy-induced nausea
    on Day 1 of chemotherapy., A total of 576 patients were included in final analysis.,
  Mixed model analyses demonstrated that all doses of ginger significantly reduced
    acute nausea severity compared to placebo on Day 1 of chemotherapy., The largest
    reduction in nausea intensity occurred with 0.5 g and 1.0 g of ginger., Anticipatory
    nausea was a key factor in acute chemotherapy-induced nausea., Ginger supplementation
    at a daily dose of 0.5 g1.0 g significantly aids in reduction of the severity
    of acute chemotherapy-induced nausea in adult cancer patients., 'Despite the widespread
    use of the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist antiemetics, ondansetron, granistron, and
    dolasetron mesylate, post-chemotherapy nausea and vomiting continue to be reported
    by over 70% of patients.', Research also suggests that the 5-HT3 receptor antagonists
    are clinically more effective against emesis than they are against nausea., 'In
    general, there is still room for improvement in the control of nausea associated
    with chemotherapy for cancer.', Chemotherapy-induced nausea  can be categorized
    into three different types of nausea., Anticipatory nausea occurs before the start
    of chemotherapy in anticipation of the treatment and develops in 820% of patients.,
  'Acute nausea occurs within 24 h post-chemotherapy, whereas delayed nausea occurs
    after 24 h and up to 5 days post-chemotherapy.', The majority of patients report
    the most severe nausea on Day 1 of chemotherapy and are less likely to have severe
    nausea on subsequent days if they do not experience it on Day 1., 'Recently, Schwartzberg
    et al.', demonstrated that patients who experience nausea and vomiting from their
    initial chemotherapy cycle of low emetogenic chemotherapy were 3.1 times more
    likely to experience nausea and vomiting at subsequent chemotherapy cycles compared
    to a patient who did not experience nausea and vomiting with their initial chemotherapy
    cycle., 'This rate is comparable to the rates of 3.8 and 3.7 for patients receiving
    moderate or highly emetogenic chemotherapy.Therefore, it can be concluded that
    a patient who experiences nausea and vomiting at a chemotherapy cycle will be
    more likely to experience nausea and vomiting at subsequent chemotherapy cycles
    regardless of the type of chemotherapy.', 'Ginger, an ancient spice, is most notably
    known for its role as a flavoring agent for food in Asian and Indian recipes.',
  'For over 2,500 years, the dried aromatic rhizome  of ginger, has been used to treat
    gastrointestinal upsets, as well as joint and muscle pain.', Ginger is listed
    as a food on the FDAs generally regarded as safe list., 'Research studies have
    demonstrated gingers effectiveness against nausea associated with motion sickness,
    pregnancy, and surgery.', 'Previous clinical trials suggest that ginger may be
    effective against CIN, but design inadequacies, small numbers, and lack of dose-finding
    studies, limit their power and generalizability.', 'We conducted a randomized,
    double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-finding clinical trial to determine if
    ginger was more effective than placebo in controlling acute CIN in cancer patients
    receiving 5-HT3 receptor antagonist antiemetics.', 'Eligible patients were 18
    years of age, able to understand English, had a diagnosis of cancer, may have
    received 1 chemotherapy cycle, and were scheduled for at least three additional
    chemotherapy cycles.', Chemotherapy must have been given without concurrent radiation
    therapy or interferon and without planned interruption by radiation therapy or
    surgery., 'All patients must have experienced nausea of any severity in any chemotherapy
    cycle before study enrollment, as well as scheduled to receive a 5-HT3 receptor
    antagonist  plus dexamathasone at all chemotherapy cycles.', 'Patients were not
    on coumadin or heparin for therapeutic anticoagulation, did not have a bleeding
    disorder, and had platelet count &gt;100,000/l before the baseline cycle.', 'This
    study was a phase II/III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical
    trial conducted in 23 private practice oncology groups funded by the National
    Cancer Institutes Community Clinical Oncology Program  and affiliated with the
    University of Rochester Cancer Center CCOP Research Base.', The primary objective
    of the study was to determine if ginger supplementation reduced acute CIN  in
    patients receiving standard 5-HT3 receptor antagonist antiemetics plus dexamethasone.,
  The institutional review board of the University of Rochester and each participating
    site approved the protocol., Written informed consent was obtained from each patient.,
  'This study is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov, #NCT00040742.', Randomization was
    stratified by CCOP site., 'Within each site, a computer-generated random number
    table with block size eight was used to randomly assign patients to one of four
    treatment arms.', 'The randomization assigned patients to the four arms in the
    ratio 1:1:1:1.', 'The ginger and placebo capsules were manufactured by Aphios
    Corporation in Woburn, MA.', 'Ginger capsules contained a purified liquid extract
    of ginger root  with concentrated 8.5 mg of combined gingerols, zingerone, and
    shogoal content, equivalent to 250 mg of ginger root, in extra virgin olive oil
    containing other excipients to improve solubilization and increase bioavailability.',
  The placebo capsules consisted of only the extra virgin olive oil containing a higher
    level of excipients in order to match the weight of the ginger capsules., 'Both
    the ginger and placebo products were double encapsulated in size 0, white, opaque,
    hard gelatin capsules with a nitrogen cap.', The double encapsulation and nitrogen
    cap masked any difference in smell or color between the two products., The capsules
    were packaged in blister packs containing six capsules  and were grouped into
    morning and evening doses., 'The contents of the blister packs for each study
    arm were: arm 1  = 3 placebo capsules twice daily; arm 2  = 2 placebo capsules
    and 1 ginger capsule twice daily; arm 3  = 1 placebo capsule and 2 ginger capsules
    twice daily; arm 4  = 3 ginger capsules twice daily.', 'The days surrounding each
    chemotherapy infusion were identified for study purposes as follows: Days 3 to
    1 were before chemotherapy, Day 1 was the day of chemotherapy infusion, and Days
    24 were post-chemotherapy.', All patients received 5-HT3 antiemetics plus dexamathasone
    on Day 1 of all chemotherapy cycles., 'All patients took the study medication
    twice daily for 6 days, starting 3 days before the start chemotherapy for study
    cycles 2 and 3.', Compliance was measured by pill counts at the end of each study
    cycle., Nausea and emesis were measured using a modified four-day patient report
    diary developed by Burish  and Carey  and used by us in previous large clinical
    trials., Patients reported the severity of nausea four times each day  over three
    four-day periods  during each cycle  using a 7-point semantic rating scale anchored
    by 1 = Not at all Nauseated and by 7 = Extremely Nauseated., Anti-nausea medication
    use and number of vomiting episodes were also recorded., 'A 13-item Symptom Inventory
    was used to assess potential side effects of ginger, as well as anticipatory nausea,
    on an 11-point scale anchored by 0  and 10.', 'The Symptom Inventory was completed
    once during the baseline cycle  and three times during study cycles 2 and 3, before
    Day 1 of chemotherapy, and after completion of study medication ).', Anticipatory
    nausea was analyzed using the nausea item on the Symptom Inventory completed prior
    to chemotherapy., Quality of life was assessed using the 27-item Functional Assessment
    of Chronic Illness Therapy-General  at baseline and follow-up assessments., All
    statistical tests were performed at the two-tailed 5% level of significance and
    data were analyzed on an intent-to-treat basis., Acute nausea severity was measured
    as the average and maximum of the evening and night Day 1 responses., 'In order
    to analyze acute nausea severity accurately, we had to ensure that patients received
    chemotherapy before rating their nausea severity on Day 1 in the four-day diary.',
  We excluded the morning and afternoon nausea responses on Day 1 because it was unlikely
    that a patient would have received chemotherapy prior to either of these rating
    times., Delayed nausea severity was measured as the average and maximum of all
    the values for Days 2 and 3., The follow-up phase nausea severity was measured
    as the average and maximum of the responses for Day 4., 'Average nausea severity  is
    indicated as the primary outcome measure in the protocol, but the maximum nausea
    severity   was considered to be more relevant from the patients point of view.',
  Mixed model analyses and Type 3 tests of fixed effects using the KenwardRoger degrees
    of freedom procedure  were used to examine the change from baseline NAv and NMx
    on Day 1., 'The fixed effects in the model were Dose, Cycle and Dose  Cycle interaction
    and the random effects consisted of subjectsubject and within-subject variations.',
  'Under the missing-at-random assumption, missing values should not cause substantial
    bias using this method of analysis; however we checked this with multiple imputation  and
    the changes in the results were minor.', Contrasts were used to estimate and test
    the effect size of placebo versus ginger at any dose., Mean differences between
    each ginger dose and placebo were also estimated and tested using the TukeyKramer
    procedure for multiple comparisons., 'Similar analyses were used to examine the
    secondary outcomes delayed nausea, quality of life, and vomiting.', 'To examine
    the effects of anticipatory nausea, the pre-chemotherapy nausea symptom inventory
    item score was added as a covariate in the above mixed model.', Computations were
    performed with SAS Version 9.2  and R Version 2.9.1., 'From June 2002 to December
    2008, a total of 744 cancer patients were enrolled and randomized into one of
    the four treatment arms.', 'Of these 744 patients, 662 completed the baseline
    measures prior to the study medication being administered.', 'Of the 662 patients
    who completed the baseline cycle, 562  completed study cycle 2  and 471  completed
    study cycle 3.', The analyses reported herein were conducted on 576  patients
    who provided evaluable data at either study cycle 2 or 3., The baseline characteristics
    were equivalent across treatment groups., 'The majority of patients were white,
    female  with a mean age of 53 years and the most common types of cancer were breast,
    gastrointestinal, and lung  cancers.', 'Overall reasons for non-completion of
    the study included: changed mind about participation, incomplete study forms,
    gastrointestinal symptoms, other medical reasons, off chemotherapy, and chemotoxicity.',
  'The two most prominent reasons for dropout at baseline were changed mind about
    participation  and incomplete study forms, which were also the major causes for
    dropout for study cycles 2 and 3.', 'There were no meaningful or statistically
    significant mean differences between the four treatment arms at baseline for NAv,
    NMx, or quality of life.', Compliance to study medication did not significantly
    differ between treatment arms or study cycle., 'In the four-day diary, patients
    were asked to record the number of times they used antiemetic medication after
    their chemotherapy treatment.', 'The antiemetic medications were categorized into
    four types of medication: Type 1, Type 2, Type 3, and Type 4.', There were no
    significant differences between treatment arms in regard to the use of antiemetics.,
  'Overall, the majority of patients did report taking antiemetic medications and
    the placebo arm tended to report many uses of antiemetic medications compared
    to the ginger arms.', Patient flow diagram., A total of 744 patients were consented
    and randomized into one of four treatment arms., There was no significant difference
    in the dropout rate between treatment arms or study cycle., 'Only 469 patients
    fully completed the study, although data was evaluable for 576 patients and included
    in the analyses


    The primary objective of this clinical trial was to determine if ginger was more
    effective than placebo at reducing nausea severity on Day 1 of chemotherapy.',
  'Initially, the protocol called for ANCOVA on NAv on Day 1 ratings from the daily
    diary, with baseline as the covariate.', 'However, the distribution of the baseline
    and post-treatment outcome were positively skewed and using baseline as covariate
    in ANCOVA would give high-baseline subjects disproportionate influence.', Change
    scores showed no skewness., 'Consequently, mixed model analyses on change scores
    were performed to combine the information in both study cycles, obtain more power,
    and evaluate any differences in the two cycles.', 'The mixed model analyses across
    both study cycles 2 and 3, using NAv and NMx, revealed that all doses of ginger
    significantly reduced acute CIN in both study cycles compared to placebo.', Differences
    in the least-squares means showed that 0.5 g and 1.0 g daily ginger were the most
    effective at reducing acute CIN., Ginger reduces severity of acute chemotherapy-induced
    nausea., The boxplots represent the mean change in average nausea severity  and
    maximum nausea severity  for each treatment arm  on Day 1 of chemotherapy., Each
    shaded bar is a different treatment arm., All doses of ginger significantly reduced
    nausea severity on Day 1 of chemotherapy compared to placebo., The largest reduction
    in acute nausea occurred with 0.5 g and 1.0 g of ginger daily., 'Although study
    cycle 3 appears to show a greater reduction in nausea, there was no significant
    difference in mean nausea change between the two study cycles


    The secondary objectives of the study were to determine the effects of ginger
    on delayed nausea, anticipatory nausea, and quality of life in patients receiving
    chemotherapy.', Mixed model analyses were used to examine delayed nausea for all
    time intervals on Day 2 and Day 3 and follow-up nausea on Day 4 when patients
    were no longer on study medication., 'Despite the significant reduction in acute
    nausea on Day 1  in all the ginger arms compared to placebo, the significance
    of ginger supplementation weakens for delayed  and follow-up nausea.', These data
    suggest that patients reported more severe delayed nausea compared to acute nausea.,
  'Overall, no significant differences were observed in vomiting or quality of life,
    between the three ginger arms and placebo.', The majority of patients did not
    report episodes of vomiting., 'In contrast, type 3 tests of fixed effects revealed
    that anticipatory nausea  is also a factor in acute CIN.', Average nausea severity  over
    time for each study cycle., 'Treatment arms are: placebo ; 0.5 g ginger ; 1.0
    g ginger ; 1.5 g ginger.', Acute phase represents evening and night of Day 1 diary
    nausea responses; delayed phase represents all diary nausea responses on Day 2
    and Day 3; and follow-up phase represents all diary nausea responses on Day 4.,
  'The top two graphs show the mean change in NAv severity for acute, delayed, and
    follow-up phases during study cycle 2  and study cycle 3.', 'The middle two graphs
    show the NAv severity for acute, delayed, and follow-up phases during study cycles
    2 and 3.', 'The bottom two graphs show the NAv severity for acute, delayed, and
    follow-up phases during the baseline cycle for patients that continued to study
    cycle 2 and study cycle 3


    Maximum nausea severity  over time for each study cycle.', 'Treatment arms are:
    placebo ; 0.5 g ginger ; 1.0 g ginger ; 1.5 g ginger.', 'Acute phase represents
    evening and night of Day 1 diary nausea responses, delayed phase represents all
    diary nausea responses on Day 2 and Day 3, and follow-up phase represents all
    diary nausea responses on Day 4.', 'The top two graphs show the mean change in
    NMx severity for acute, delayed, and follow-up phases during study cycle 2  and
    study cycle 3.', 'The middle two graphs show the NMx severity for acute, delayed,
    and follow-up phases during study cycles 2 and 3.', 'The bottom two graphs show
    the NMx severity for acute, delayed, and follow-up phases during the baseline
    cycle for patients that continued to study cycle 2 and study cycle 3


    A total of 24 adverse events were reported during the course of the study.', Only
    nine of the reported adverse advents were considered to be related to study drug  and
    these patients withdrew from the study., 'These adverse reactions included gastrointestinal
    symptoms, such as Grade 2 heartburn, bruising/flushing, and rash.', Nausea is
    a complicated symptom to research and effectively treat because it is a subjective
    and unobservable phenomenon., 'Previous research has shown that perceived susceptibility
    and expectancy, as well as age, are important risk factors for nausea severity.',
  'In this large, multisite clinical trial, ginger reduced the severity of acute nausea
    in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.', 'One key feature of this study was
    the implementation of the six-day course of ginger 3 days before the start of
    chemotherapy, an approach similar to the administration of ginger in prevention
    of motion sickness.', 'Although our primary objective was to reduce acute CIN,
    the six-day course of ginger or placebo allowed us to evaluate anticipatory and
    delayed CIN.', Our data suggests that anticipatory nausea contributes to the report
    of acute nausea., This phenomenon is by Roscoe et al.., The authors reported that
    the odds of cancer patients reporting severe nausea from chemotherapy was 2.85
    times greater in patients who said they were susceptible to nausea compared to
    others who stated they were not susceptible., We can only speculate that the mechanism
    by which ginger alleviates nausea is through a combination of anti-inflammatory
    and anti-spasmodic activities., 'Current antiemetic medications, such as 5-HT3,
    are receptor antagonists for specific neurotransmitters in the gastrointestinal
    tract.', 'Likewise, ginger can bind 5-HT3 receptors to enhance antiemetic effects
    and can increase detoxification enzymes to counteract oxidative damage to tissues.',
  We speculate that starting ginger 3 days before the start of chemotherapy may have
    primed the gut for an anti-nausea response through 5-HT3 receptor binding and
    induction of detoxification enzymes., 'Furthermore, a receptor-based mechanism
    of action could explain why the lower ginger doses were more effective than the
    highest dose.', 'Hypothetically, a certain dose ginger  may saturate the receptors
    rendering higher doses ineffective.', 'Similar to our findings, Lien et al.',
  published that 1.0 g dose of ginger was more effective against motion sickness than
    2.0 g dose., 'The main strengths of this study include the large sample size,
    double-blinded treatment, and evaluation of three types of CIN.', 'Two main weaknesses
    of the study, which should be controlled for in future studies, were not controlling
    for chemotherapy regimens  or the severity level of nausea before enrollment.',
  'Recent research demonstrated that patients are more likely to experience CINV from
    subsequent chemotherapy cycles if CINV is experienced during the initial or earlier
    cycle, regardless of chemotherapy regimen.', Our study did not collect information
    on the type of chemotherapy regimen because we only enrolled patients that reported
    nausea from a previous chemotherapy cycle., This study design enabled the investigation
    of presence of nausea without vomiting., The low incidence of emesis was expected
    since 5-HT3 receptor antagonist antiemetics  were used., 'However, we did not
    expect the NAv and NMx severity at baseline to be low considering patients reported
    nausea during a previous chemotherapy cycle.', Limitations of the study results
    include the small effect size for nausea severity and the lack of effect on delayed
    nausea and quality of life., The effect size for nausea severity may have been
    larger if the study only enrolled patients with moderate to severe nausea with
    chemotherapy prior to enrollment., 'Furthermore, our data showed that patients
    reported more severe delayed nausea  compared to acute nausea  suggesting that
    delayed nausea is a more debilitating problem for patients than acute nausea.',
  The inability to detect a significant difference on quality of life could be due
    to the inability to control delayed nausea., We speculate that a reduction in
    delayed nausea would significantly improve patient quality of life during chemotherapy.,
  'Although some cancer patients may use ginger for prevention or treatment of CIN,
    little published work has addressed the efficacy of ginger for CIN.', 'Since 1986,
    only five articles published the use of ginger for CINV in cancer patients receiving
    chemotherapy.', 'In 1986, Pace et al.', studied 20 patients being treated for
    leukemia with cytosine arabinoside  and showed that patients who received ginger
    had significantly less severe nausea on the day of chemotherapy and on the following
    day than those taking the placebo capsules., 'Similarly, Sontakke et al.', showed
    that 1 g of ginger before and after chemotherapy was as good as metoclopramide
    at complete control of nausea., 'In contrast, Zick et al.', 'showed no improvement
    in acute or delayed CIN with ginger  in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
    study in 162 cancer patients.', Levine et al., showed that a high protein diet
    with 1.0 g of ginger reduced severity of delayed nausea and use of antiemetic
    medications., 'However, the study contributed the reduction to the high protein
    diet and not necessarily to ginger supplementation.', 'Most recently, Pillai et
    al.', demonstrated that ginger powder  reduced the severity of acute and delayed
    CINV in children and young adults receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy for
    sarcoma., 'We conclude that ginger, at dose of 0.5 g to 1.0 g daily, significantly
    aids in the reduction of acute CIN in patients receiving standard antiemetics.',
  'Thus far, ginger has demonstrated a beneficial effect on acute nausea from chemotherapy,
    however the effectiveness of ginger for nausea associated with other medical conditions
    awaits further controlled trials.', This research was supported by the National
    Cancer Institute of the National Institutes of Health PHS grants 1R25CA10618  and
    U10CA37420., None of the authors have conflicts of interest to disclose.]
