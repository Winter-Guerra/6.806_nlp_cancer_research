text: [The breast cancer resistance protein  is a drug efflux transporter that can
    affect the pharmacological and toxicological properties of many molecules., 'Urolithins,
    metabolites produced by the gut microbiota from ellagic acid  and ellagitannins,
    have been acknowledged with in vivo anti-inflammatory and cancer chemopreventive
    properties.', 'This study evaluated whether urolithins  and their main phase II
    metabolites Uro-A sulfate, Uro-A glucuronide, and Uro-B glucuronide as well as
    their precursor EA were substrates for ABCG2/BCRP.', Parental and Bcrp1-transduced
    MDCKII cells were used for active transport assays., 'Uro-A and, to a lesser extent,
    Uro-A sulfate showed a significant increase in apically directed translocation
    in Bcrp1-transduced cells.', Bcrp1 did not show affinity for the rest of the tested
    compounds., 'Data were confirmed for murine, human, bovine, and ovine BCRP-transduced
    subclones as well as with the use of the selective BCRP inhibitor Ko143.', The
    transport inhibition by Uro-A was analyzed by flow cytometry compared to Ko143
    using the antineoplastic agent mitoxantrone as a model substrate., Results showed
    that Uro-A was able to inhibit mitoxantrone transport in a dose-dependent manner.,
  This study reports for the first time that Uro-A and its sulfate conjugate are ABCG2/BCRP
    substrates., The results suggest that physiologically relevant concentrations
    of these gut microbiota-derived metabolites could modulate ABCG2/BCRP-mediated
    transport processes and mechanisms of cancer drug resistance., Further in vivo
    investigations are warranted., 'urolithin; ellagic acid; ABCG2/BCRP transporters;
    gut microbiota; Bcrp1-MDCKII cells


    ABCG2/BCRP is an ATP-binding cassette  transporter that mediates energy-dependent
    translocation of substrates from cells in the intestine, liver, kidney, mammary
    gland, etc., across cellular membranes, affecting the pharmacokinetics and disposition
    of drugs and other compounds such as xenotoxins and endogenous compounds in tissues
    and mediating drugdrug interactions.', The multifunctional behavior of ABCG2/BCRP
    linked to great substrate specificities for a wide range of compounds supported
    its important role in homeostatic processes., 'In addition, the modulation of
    ABCG2/BCRP transporters can affect chemotherapeutic treatments by modulating the
    pharmacokinetic behavior of anticancer drugs.', Some in vitro and in vivo studies
    using BCRP-overexpressing cell lines and/or knockout mice have indicated that
    plant-derived polyphenols such as flavonoids and the stilbene resveratrol can
    interact directly with BCRP by modulating both its transport function and ATPase
    activity., 'Recently, the important role of ABCG2/BCRP in the transport of glucuronide
    and sulfate conjugates of polyphenols including the flavonoids naringenin, genistein,
    and daidzein, as well as resveratrol conjugates, has been described.', Urolithins
    are dibenzopyran-6-one derivatives produced from ellagitannins and ellagic acid  by
    the gut microbiota through the loss of one lactone ring present in ellagic acid  and
    successive removals of hydroxyl groups., 'Urolithins have been found in plasma,
    urine, feces, and tissues in a number of animals including the pig, rat, mouse,
    beef cattle, etc.', 'Urolithins are also produced by humans, and their occurrence
    has been reported in plasma, feces, urine, and also prostate tissue after the
    intake of ellagitannin-containing foods such as pomegranates, strawberries, raspberries,
    walnuts, and oak-aged wines.', 'Phase II derived conjugates of urolithins reach
    the plasma and systemic organs at low micromolar concentrations, whereas high
    concentrations of the aglycone forms can be found in the gut.', Figure 1., 'Chemical
    structures of EA, Uro-D, Uro-C, Uro-A, and Uro-B.', The arrows designate the sequence
    of metabolic steps carried out by the gut microbiota., 'In the past decade, after
    our first report about the occurrence of urolithins in humans, numerous in vitro
    and in vivo studies have shown a wide range of biological activities of urolithins,
    mainly attributed to Uro-A, such as anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial,
    and estrogenic/antiestrogenic.', 'However, the possible role of ABC transporters
    in the bioavailability of urolithins remains unknown.', 'Our aim was to evaluate
    whether ellagic acid, urolithins A, B C, and D, and their main glucuronide and
    sulfate derivates  might be ABCG2/BCRP substrates and/or inhibitors.', EA was
    purchased from Sigma-Aldrich., Urolithin A  and urolithin B  were synthesized
    as described previously., Uro B glucuronide  was prepared according to the method
    of Lucas et al., Urolithin A glucuronide  and urolithin A sulfate  were prepared
    as a mixture of regioisomers., Experimental procedure and 1H NMR data for the
    synthesis of Uro-A and Uro-A sulfate are detailed in the Supporting Information.,
  'Briefly, Uro-A was first monoprotected with a silyl protecting group.', Random   protection
    of Uro-A and subsequent chromatographic separation afforded the two possible monophenolic
    derivatives 1 and 2 as a regioisomeric mixture  and the double-silylated Uro-A.,
  The glycosylation reaction of acceptors 1 and 2 with glucuronosyl donor 3 was performed
    using the same conditions described previously to give compounds 4 and 5 as a
    regioisomeric mixture., Ester hydrolysis and deprotection of acetyl and TBDMS
    groups were carried out in one step by using K2CO3 and KF in a methanolwater solution.,
  'Reverse phase purification of the crude afforded a 1:1 regioisomeric mixture of
    Uro-A 3-glucuronide and Uro-A 8-glucuronide.', Uro-A sulfate was also prepared
    as a mixture of regioisomers following a similar strategy to the one used for
    the glucuronate derivatives., 'Sulfation of the monosilylated urolithin derivatives
    1 and 2 was carried out with SO3NMe3 as sulfating reagent, NEt3 as base, and acetonitrile
    as solvent at 100 C under microwave radiation for 20 min.', 'The reaction afforded
    the sulfated 1:1 mixture of urolithin derivatives 6 and 7 in 92% yield.', 'Final
    silyl deprotection with KF and reverse phase purification gave a 1:1 mixture of
    Uro-A 3-sulfate and Uro-A 8-sulfate.', Urolithin C  and urolithin D  were purchased
    from Dalton Pharma Services., Purity was &gt;95% in all tested compounds., 'Dimethyl
    sulfoxide, diethyl ether, and HPLC reagents, formic acid and acetonitrile, were
    obtained from Panreac.', Methanol  was from Lab-Scan., Ko143 was purchased from
    Tocris., Ultrapure Millipore water was used for all of the experiments., Figure

    and their human BCRP-transduced and murine Bcrp1-transduced subclones were kindly
    provided by Dr. A. H. Schinkel, Netherlands Cancer Institute.', MDCKII cells stably
    transduced with bovine and ovine variants of ABCG2 have recently been generated
    by the research group., Culture conditions were as previously described., 'The
    cells were cultured in Dulbeccos modified Eagles medium  containing GlutaMAX  and
    supplemented with penicillin, streptomycin, and 10%  fetal calf serum  at 37 C
    in the presence of 5% CO2.', The cells were trypsinized every 34 days for subculturing.,
  All of the test samples were solubilized in DMSO  and were filter sterilized  prior
    to addition to the culture media., Control cells were also run in parallel and
    subjected to the same changes in medium with 0.5% DMSO., Transepithelial transport
    assays using Transwell plates were carried out as described previously with minor
    modifications., Cells were seeded on microporous polycarbonate membrane filters  at
    a density of 1.0  106 cells per well., 'Cells were grown for 3 days, and the medium
    was replaced every day.', Transepithelial resistance was measured in each well
    using a Millicell ERS ohm-meter., 'Wells registering a resistance of 200 , after
    correction for the resistance obtained in blank control wells, were used in the
    transport experiments.', The measurement was repeated at the end of the experiment
    to check the tightness of the monolayer., 'Before the start of the experiment,
    medium on both sides of the monolayer was replaced with 2 mL of Optimem medium,
    without serum.', 'After 2 h of preincubation, the experiment was started by replacing
    the medium in either the apical or basolateral compartment with fresh Optimem
    medium containing 20 M of the compound tested.', Aliquots of 100 L were taken
    from the opposite compartment at 2 and 4 h and stored at 20 C until LC-MS analysis.,
  'In the cotreatments assays, the inhibitor Ko143  was added 2 h before each compound
    and remained during all of the experiment.', Experiments were carried out in triplicate.,
  In vitro accumulation assays were carried out as described previously using mitoxantrone  as
    fluorescent substrate., 'In brief, subconfluent cultures were used after 36 h
    from seeding.', 'Cells were incubated in Optimem medium with or without Ko143
    inhibitor  or EA and urolithins A, B, C, and D at different concentrations for
    60 min before the addition of MXR.', All compounds were applied on the apical
    side., 'Accumulation of MXR was allowed for 1 h at 37 C. Then, cells were washed,
    trypsinized, collected, and resuspended in PBS with 2.5% fetal calf serum.', Relative
    cellular accumulation of MXR of at least 5000 cells was determined by flow cytometry
    using a FACSCalibur cytometer., Samples were gated on forward scatter versus side
    scatter to exclude cell debris and clumps., 'Excitation and emission wavelengths
    for MXR were 635 and 650 nm, respectively.', The fluorescence of the accumulated
    substrate in tested populations was quantified from histogram plots using the
    median of fluorescence., At least three independent experiments were performed.,
  BCRP inhibition increases accumulation of MXR in Bcrp1/BCRP-transduced cells and
    thus increases MF., 'Possible background fluorescence of urolithins was checked
    in appropriate channels, but the fluorescence was negligible.', Flow cytometry
    data were processed and analyzed using WinMDI version 2.8 software., 'Percentage
    of inhibition was calculated according to the following equation: % inhibition
    = /  100.', Cell media after transport studies was processed as described elsewhere.,
  'Briefly, ACN  was added to 100 L of culture media, vortexed, and centrifuged at
    16435g for 10 min.', The supernatant was then concentrated in a Speedvac concentrator
    Savant SPD121P  and the residue redissolved in 100 L of MeOH and filtered  before
    analysis by LC-MS using the conditions described below., Aliquots of processed
    cell media were analyzed using an LC-MS system., 'The HPLC system was equipped
    with a 100  3 mm i.d., 2.7 m, reverse phase C18 column  and a single-quadrupole
    mass detector in series.', 'Water/formic acid  and ACN were used as mobile phases
    A and B, respectively, with a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min.', 'The linear gradient
    started with 5% of solvent B in solvent A, reaching 18% solvent B at 7 min, 28%
    at 17 min, 50% from 22 min, and 90% at 27 min, which was maintained up to 29 min.',
  The initial conditions were re-established at 29 min and kept under isocratic conditions
    up to 33 min., Injections  were made for each sample at 25 C. The mass detector
    was a quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with an ESI system., MS spectra were
    measured in selective ion monitoring  mode using  ions for measuring all tested
    compounds., MS data were acquired in the negative ionization mode., 'Identification
    of all tested compounds was carried out by direct comparison  with available standards
    and confirmed by their spectral properties, molecular mass, and fragmentation
    pattern.', Calibration curves were obtained for each tested compound with good
    linearity., EA was quantified at 360 nm and urolithins and their conjugates were
    quantified at 305 nm using the corresponding available standards., All data are
    presented as mean values  SD., A two-tailed unpaired Students t test was used
    for statistical analysis of the data., A p value of ;0.05 was considered to be
    significant., 'Initial Screening of the Transport of Urolithins and EA on Parental
    and Bcrp1-Transduced MDCKII Cell Models


    As initial screening, we used the polarized canine kidney cell line MDCKII and
    its subclone transduced with murine Bcrp1 cDNAs to test the possible role of Bcrp1
    in the in vitro transport of EA, urolithins, and some representative in vivo conjugates  at
    10 M for 2 and 4 h.


    In the MDCKII parental cell line, both Uro-A and Uro-B aglycones showed similar
    apically and basolaterally directed translocations, with percentages of transport
    around 20% at 4 h, whereas the transport values for the rest of compounds were
    lower.', Figure 3., 'Transepithelial transport of tested compounds  in  parental
    MDCKII cells and  their murine Bcrp1-transduced derivatives:  translocation from
    the basolateral to the apical compartment;  translocation from the apical to the
    basolateral compartment.', The experiment was started with the addition of each
    compound to one compartment., 'After 2 and 4 h, the percentage of each compound
    appearing in the opposite compartment was measured by LC-MS and plotted.', Data
    are expressed as mean values  SD., 'In the murine Bcrp1-transduced MDCKII cell
    line the most remarkable results were found for Uro-A and Uro-A sulfate, in which
    translocation from the basolateral to the apical compartment significantly increased
    in comparison with parental cells.', The rest of the compounds showed no changes
    in the Bcrp1-transduced MDCKII cell line compared to parental cells., 'Overall,
    these results showed an efficient transport of Uro-A by murine Bcrp1 and a moderate
    transport for its sulfate conjugate in the cell line assayed.', 'Transport of
    Uro-A and Uro-A Sulfate by Human, Murine, Bovine, and Ovine BCRP-Transduced Subclone
    Cells in the Absence or Presence of Ko143


    As the transport of Uro-A by murine Bcrp1-transduced subclone cells was higher
    than in the rest of compounds, we next determined the vectorial transport of Uro-A  across
    human, murine, bovine, and ovine BCRP-transduced MDCKII cells.', 'The transport
    of Uro-A on all transduced subclones showed a significant time-dependent increase
    in the apically directed translocation, whereas the basolaterally directed translocation
    was drastically decreased versus parental cells.', 'Among the transduced subclones,
    the apically directed translocation of Uro-A was higher on murine Bcrp1  followed
    by ovine BCRP, human BCRP, and finally bovine BCRP.', Figure 4., 'Transepithelial
    transport of Uro-A  in parental MDCKII cells and in their murine Bcrp1- and human,
    bovine, and ovine BCRP-transduced subclones in the absence or presence of Ko143
    :  translocation from the basolateral to the apical compartment;  translocation
    from the apical to the basolateral compartment.', The experiment was carried out
    as indicated in Figure 2., Data are expressed as mean values  SD., 'In addition,
    we next confirmed the transport of Uro-A mediated by ABCG2/BCRP by performing
    a cotreatment with a selective BCRP inhibitor, Ko143  on all MDCKII subclones.',
  'The BCRP-mediated transport of Uro-A was completely inhibited in all transduced
    cells, resulting in a vectorial translocation pattern equal to that of the MDCKII
    parental cell line  and thus confirming that Uro-A is transported by ABCG2/BCRP.',
  'Due to the small available amount of the standard Uro-A sulfate, we focused on
    the study of the transport of this metabolite by only murine Bcrp1 and human BCRP.',
  'There was a significant increase in the apically directed translocation for Uro-A
    sulfate using human BCRP-transduced MDCKII cells, which was higher than that observed
    for murine Bcrp1.', 'Therefore, these data confirmed that Uro-A sulfate is also
    a natural ABCG2/BCRP substrate.', Figure 5., 'Transepithelial transport of Uro-A
    sulfate  in parental MDCKII and in their murine Bcrp1- and human BCRP-transduced
    derivatives:  translocation from the basolateral to the apical compartment;  translocation
    from the apical to the basolateral compartment.', The experiment was carried out
    as indicated in Figure 2., Data are expressed as mean values  SD., 'To show the
    potential inhibitory effect of urolithins on ABCG2/BCRP, the ability of these
    compounds to reverse the reduced MXR accumulation in cells transduced with the
    transporter was tested in flow cytometry experiments.', Percentage of inhibition
    of the different concentrations of Uro-A for Bcrp1/BCRP-transduced cells was related
    to the effect of reference inhibitor Ko143., 'Our results showed that Uro-A was
    able to inhibit ABCG2/BCRP increasing, in a dose-dependent manner, the accumulation
    of MXR in human BCRP and murine Bcrp1 transduced cells, showing percentages of
    inhibition of 4050% at 50 M. This result supported the strong interaction between
    Uro-A and the transporter, showing its important potential as inhibitor because
    other tested compounds such as urolithins B, C, and D and EA at 50 and 100 M did
    not show any inhibition.', Figure 6., Percentage of inhibition of the different
    concentrations of Uro-A for Bcrp1/BCRP-transduced cells in mitoxantrone accumulation
    assays., Data are expressed as mean values  SD., Percentage of inhibition was
    related to the effect of reference inhibitor Ko143., 'Uro-A, the most abundant
    urolithin produced by humans, has been reported to be the most active urolithin
    with acknowledged in vitro and in vivo anti-inflammatory and anticarcinogenic
    activities.', 'With regard to the biological activity of the phase II conjugates,
    the main in vivo circulating conjugate, Uro-A glur, has shown to decrease the
    TNF--induced inflammation in endothelial cells.', 'Taking into account the above,
    we evaluated whether urolithins and some representative circulating conjugates
    could be substrates for ABCG2/BCRP at a physiologically relevant concentration.',
  For this purpose we examined their active transport using a parental and murine
    Bcrp1-transduced MDCKII cell model., 'Our results indicated that only Uro-A, and
    also its sulfate conjugate, showed a significant increase in the apically directed
    translocation together with a decrease of the basolaterally directed translocation
    compared to parental cells.', 'In contrast, Bcrp1 showed no affinity for the urolithin
    precursor EA and the rest of the urolithins and glucuronide conjugates.', Our
    results indicate that the affinity of ABCG2/BCRP for urolithins seems to be influenced
    by the number and position of hydroxyl groups in the urolithin scaffold., 'In
    the present study, BCRP showed affinity only for Uro-A, with two hydroxyl groups
    in 3- and 8-positions.', 'In this regard, a structureactivity relationship  study
    comparing the BCRP inhibitory effect of 12 different flavonoids indicated that
    flavones were more efficient than flavonols, isoflavones, and flavanones due to
    the occurrence of hydroxyl groups  at the 5-position, in contrast to positions
    3 and 7 in flavones.', 'More recently, another SAR study in flavonoids confirmed
    that an OH group in the 5-position contributed positively to BCRP inhibition because
    the replacement of this OH group by a 3-methoxy group resulted in a decrease in
    the affinity.', Our results in urolithins also support the potential role of OH
    groups in the interaction with BCRP., 'The presence of an OH group at the 8-position,
    but not at the 3-position, might favor the interaction with BCRP, which was supported
    by the lack of interaction between BCRP and Uro-B, with only one OH group at the
    3-position.', 'In the case of urolithin A conjugates, the possible explanation
    is more difficult.', The chemical synthesis of Uro-A glur and Uro-A sulfate yielded
    a mixture of 50% Uro-A 3-glur and 50% Uro-A 8-glur for the glucuronides and also
    50% Uro-A 3-sulfate and 50% Uro-A 8-sulfate in the case of the sulfate conjugate.,
  'Therefore, some affinity of BCRP for Uro-A glur should be expected because the
    8-position was 50% available, as in the case or Uro-A sulfate.', 'However, whereas
    Uro-A sulfate was a BCRP substrate, Uro-A glur was not transported at all.', 'In
    addition, the occurrence of additional hydroxyl groups  decreased the affinity
    of BCRP for urolithins.', 'Overall, the above rationale is coincident, at least
    in part, with that launched in a previous study where estrogenic receptors  showed
    higher affinity for Uro-A than for Uro-B.', 'The transport of Uro-A sulfate  confirms
    that ABCG2/BCRP might be a general phytoestrogen transporter for a structurally
    diverse array of phytoestrogen sulfates including sulfate conjugates of enterolignans,
    isoflavones, and coumestans, under physiological conditions.', 'Interestingly,
    it was also found that the inhibitory potency against ABCG2/BCRP of daidzein-7-glucuronide
    was 100-fold lower than that of daidzein, whereas daidzein-4-sulfate showed an
    inhibitory potency comparable to that of daidzein.', 'In the present study, the
    affinity of ABCG2/BCRP for Uro-A was also confirmed for bovine and ovine BCRP
    as well as for human BCRP transporters in the line of recent studies that have
    included the comparative inhibition among murine Bcrp1, bovine and ovine BCRP,
    and human BCRP.', 'In vitro results showed an efficient and dose-dependent inhibition
    of Uro-A with percentages observed of 4050% with a concentration of 50 M for human
    BCRP and murine Bcrp1 in MXR accumulation assays, in agreement with known BCRP
    inhibitors such as the flavonoid biochanin A.', 'In addition, these data showed
    the potential of Uro-A as a reversal agent in chemotherapy treatments with regard
    to the multidrug resistance  phenotype.', 'These results indicate that urolithins,
    also produced by cattle, could interact with BCRP, affecting the oral bioavailability
    of drugs  and drug transport across barriers as previously described for the isoflavones
    genistein and daidzein.', 'On the other hand, the contribution of the phytochemical
    glucuronide transport by ABCC2/MRP2 and ABCC3/MRP3 should be considered in further
    studies taking into account the plasma metabolic profile of urolithins.', 'The
    present study shows, for the first time, that Uro-A and Uro-A sulfate are transported
    by ABCG2/BCRP in the apically directed translocation.', 'Moreover, Uro-A acts
    as inhibitor of the transporter in vitro.', 'On the contrary, the urolithin precursor
    EA as well as Uro-B, -C, and -D and the phase II conjugates Uro-A glur and Uro-B
    glur were not transported.', It has been reported that the dietary consumption
    of ellagitannin- or ellagic acid-containing foods  can exert anti-inflammatory
    effects due to the in vivo formation of Uro-A by the gut microbiota., 'However,
    the results obtained here also suggest that Uro-A might influence the pharmacokinetics
    and bioavailability of drug levels, which could lead to potential adverse effects.',
  'Therefore, further in vivo studies should clarify this hypothesis.', Experimental
