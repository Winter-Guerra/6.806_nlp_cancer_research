text: [The antioxidant activity and phenolic compound profiles of six fractions  obtained
    from sunflower seed extract were studied., HPLCMS analysis was applied for quantitative
    and qualitative determination of phenolic compounds of the fractions., 'The antioxidant
    activity of the fractions was studied in terms of their ability to scavenge DPPH
    and ABTS+ and to reduce Fe3+/ferricyanide complex to the ferrous form and was
    expressed as EC50, TEAC and reducing power values, respectively.', The results
    of all antioxidant activity tests showed good correlations among each other and
    with the phenolic contents for the individual fractions., The fractions IVVI were
    characterized by high antioxidant activity., '5-O-Caffeoylquinic acid was a predominant
    compound of fractions IV and V, while dicaffeoylquinic acid isomers and caffeoyl-dimethoxycinnamoylquinic
    acid isomers accounted for 76.6 % of phenolic compounds of fraction VI.', 'Ferulic
    acid, p-coumaroylquinic acid isomers, ferulic acid dehydrotrimer isomers and some
    quercetin derivatives were also identified.', The highest content of those compounds
    was noted in fraction III., 'Sunflower seeds Phenolic compound profile Antioxidant

    Antioxidants are applied in food industry as additives limiting oxidation of food
    components, especially lipids.', The oxidation leads to losses in food quality
    and shelf life., The antioxidants play an important role also in living organisms
    since they prevent excessive free radical formation in cells., 'The extent of
    free radicals may cause disruption of biologically imported molecules, and in
    consequence the onset of various diseases.', 'It is believed that oxidative processes
    are among the reasons for deficiency of immunological system and increased risk
    of infectious diseases, cancer development, diabetes, arthritis, rheumatoid diseases,
    respiratory diseases, cataracts, atherosclerosis and a series of destructive processes
    due to aging, schizophrenia and Alzheimers disease.', Fruits and vegetables are
    important sources of antioxidants., 'Among dietary plant products, sunflower seeds
    are characterized by high antioxidant potential.', Sunflower is an important oleaginous
    plant grown in many European countries., The antioxidant compounds are present
    in both sunflower oil and oilseed-extracted meal., Extracts with high antioxidant
    activity may also be obtained from sunflower seed shells., 'Compared to vegetables
    oils, sunflower oil is especially rich in -tocopherol.', The antioxidant potential
    of defatted sunflower meal and sunflower seed shells is determined mainly by the
    content of phenolic compounds., 'However, it has to be mentioned that shells contain
    only 0.75.4 % of sunflower seed phenolics, whereas the rest is located in kernels.',
  'It has been estimated that sunflower cake, by-product of oil extraction, contains
    as much as 24 % of phenolic compounds.', 'For this reason, meal prepared from
    press residues might become a valuable source of antioxidants for application
    in food technology.', 'Up to date, sunflower by-product has been primarily used
    as ruminant feed due to its high protein content.', One of the chlorogenic acid
    isomers5-O-caffeoylquinic acidis the predominant phenolic compound in sunflower
    kernel., This compound comprises 4373 % of phenolic compounds extracted from kernels.,
  'The attempts to identify the other phenolic compounds present in sunflower seeds
    were made in the 1970s ; however, the techniques used at that time did not allow
    the identification of those compounds.', The most commonly used approach involved
    liberation of individual compounds from ester and glycosidic bonds and then their
    analysis., 'The identification of native forms of phenolic compounds present in
    sunflower seeds became possible in the recent years, especially after popularization
    of LC/MS methods.', 'Until now, researchers using this technique analyzed sunflower
    seed phenolic compounds directly in aqueous methanolic, aqueous ethanolic or acetonitrile
    crude extract.', 'Our study aimed to obtain fractions of phenolic compounds from
    the extract of dehulled sunflower seeds using Sephadex LH-20 column chromatography,
    to identify phenolic compounds in the fractions and to determine their antioxidant
    activity.', Sunflower seeds  of non-oil type served as a plant material for extraction
    of phenolic compounds., Dehulled sunflower seeds  were purchased in a specialized
    local shop in Olsztyn., All chemicals used were of analytical or HPLC grade.,
  'Sephadex LH-20, 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical,  diammonium salt, 6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethyl-chroman-2-carboxylic
    acid  and standards such as -catechin and 5-O-caffeoylquinic acid were obtained
    from Sigma-Aldrich.', 'trans-Ferulic acid and quercetin rutinoside were from Extrasynthese,
    and quercetin glucuronide from PhytoLab.', 'The other solvents and reagents, if
    not otherwise specified, were acquired from P.O.Ch..', The sunflower kernels were
    ground in a coffee mill  and defatted with hexane using a Soxhlet apparatus.,
  A 25-g portion of defatted flour was weighed into dark glass bottles and suspended
    in 200 mL of 80 %  aqueous methanol and shaken at 60 C for 15 min in a water bath.,
  'The cooled supernatant was filtered, and the residue was extracted twice more.',
  'Methanol from the combined filtrates was evaporated under vacuum at 40 C, whereas
    water residue was lyophilized for ~48 h at 70 C and 0.013 mbar.', The extraction
    was carried out in triplicate., A suspension of the extract  was loaded onto a
    column filled with Sephadex LH-20 gel., 'The chromatographic separation was performed
    using methanol as a mobile phase, which was delivered to the column by a LKB 2132
    MicroPerpex peristaltic pump  at a flow rate of 0.7 mL/min.', 'The void volume
    of the eluate V 0 = 240 mL was discarded, and then 10 mL of fractions was collected
    using a RediFrac fraction collector.', The individual fractions were analyzed
    by absorbance measurement at  = 320 nm and after reaction with FolinCiocalteus
    reagent the absorbance of the products formed was recorded at  = 725 nm using
    a spectrophotometer DU-7500., 'Subsequently, based on the prepared chromatograms
    of separation, the eluates were combined into six main fractions, and methanol
    was evaporated using a rotary evaporator.', The TPC of the main fractions was
    determined using reaction with FCR., 'Briefly, to 0.25 mL of methanolic solutions
    of fractions, 0.25 mL of FCR, 0.5 mL of saturated solution of sodium carbonate
    and 4 mL of water were added.', 'After a 25-min quiescent period, the reaction
    mixture was centrifuged  for 5 min at 5,000g, and the absorbance of supernatants
    at  = 725 nm was read using a DU-7500 spectrophotometer.', -Catechin and 5-O-caffeoylquinic
    acid were used to prepare the standard curves., The results were expressed as
    milligram of standard equivalents  per gram of fraction., 'The samples were dissolved
    in 80:20  methanol/water, filtered through a 0.45-m cellulose acetate filter  and
    analyzed using a Waters HPLC system  consisting of an autoinjector, a quaternary
    pump, a 2001 photodiode array detector  and Millenium 32 chromatography manager
    software.', 'The samples were injected into a Nova-Pak C18 column  and eluted
    for 110 min in a gradient system consisting of solvent A, water/acetic acid, and
    solvent B, water/acetonitrile/acetic acid.', 'The gradient profile was the following:
    055 min, 10020 % A; 5570 min, 2010 % A; 7080 min, 105 % A; and 80110 min, 100
    % B.', The flow rate was 1 mL/min and injection volume 30 L. The column was re-equilibrated
    between sample injections with 10 mL of acetonitrile and 25 mL of mobile phase
    A., 'The diode array detection was performed by scanning over a wavelength range
    from 210 to 400 nm at an acquisition of 1 s. The quantification of individual
    compounds was carried out using a calibration curve of the corresponding standard
    or, when reference compound was not available, of structurally related substances.',
  Samples were analyzed in duplicate., The mass spectra were obtained using a Hewlett
    Packard Model 1100 Series LC/MSD system  equipped with an electrospray ionization  interface.,
  The solvent gradient and column employed were identical to those for HPLC-PAD analyses.,
  'The ESI conditions were as follows: N2 was used both as the nebulizing gas at 275
    kPa and as drying gas ; voltage at the capillary entrance, 4,000 V; and variable
    fragmentation voltage, 100 V  and 250 V. Negative-ion mass spectra of the column
    eluate were recorded from m/z of 100 to m/z of 2,500.', DPPH-scavenging activity
    of individual fractions was measured according to the method described by Yen
    and Chen., 'From methanolic solutions of fractions at a concentration of 1 mg/mL,
    0.1 mL was pipetted into the tube containing 0.25 mL of 1 mM methanolic solution
    of DPPH and 2 mL of methanol.', The mixture was vortexed immediately  and allowed
    to stand at 20 C in the darkness for 20 min., 'Then, the absorbance at  = 517
    nm was recorded.', 'The ability to scavenge the DPPH radical was calculated using
    the following equation: scavenging effect  =   100, where A 0 is the absorbance
    of the DPPH solution and A 1 is the absorbance in the presence of the sample.',
  Scavenging effect versus concentration of fractions  was plotted., 'The EC50 value,
    defined as the amount of antioxidant  necessary to inhibit the initial DPPH by
    50 %, was read from the plot.', The TEAC of fractions was determined using the
    ABTS radical cation decolorization assay., ABTS+ was prepared by reaction of 192
    mg ABTS and 33 mg potassium persulfate in 50 mL water., 'The mixture was stirred
    overnight in the darkness at room temperature; afterward, the solution was diluted
    with methanol up to a final absorbance of 0.70  0.02 at 734 nm.', Two milliliters
    portions of ABTS+ was vortexed with 20 L of methanolic solution of fractions.,
  'Samples were incubated at 30 C using a block heater, and the absorbance was recorded
    at  = 734 nm after 6 min, strictly.', Trolox was used to obtain the standard curve.,
  The results were expressed in mmol of Trolox eq/g of fraction., The reducing power
    was determined according to the method of Oyaizu., The fraction solutions  were
    mixed with 2.5 mL of phosphate buffer  and 2.5 mL of potassium ferricyanide.,
  'Then, the mixture was incubated at 50 C for 20 min.', 'Following this, a portion
    of trichloroacetic acid  was added.', A 2.5 mL of the aliquot was mixed with 2.5
    mL of distilled water and 0.5 mL of 0.1 % ferric chloride., The absorbance of
    the mixture was recorded at  = 700 nm., The absorbance versus concentration of
    fractions  was plotted., The mean values and standard deviations  for all conducted
    analysis were calculated using Microsoft Excel 2000 software., The linear correlation
    coefficients between the total phenolic content and antioxidant activity were
    calculated by Pearson test using GraphPad Prism version 5.02 for Windows., TPC
    and TEAC values were analyzed by a one-way ANOVA statistical model with Tukeys
    post hoc test., Differences were considered significant at P ; 0.05., The phenolic
    compounds from sunflower seed crude extracts were fractionated into six fractions.,
  The yield of separated fractions in the extract and the total phenolic content of
    fractions are given in Table 1., The maximum optical density determined after
    reaction with FCR for fraction I was higher than for the other fractions., 'In
    turn, when detection was carried out at 320 nm, the highest optical density value
    was noted for fraction V. Fraction I accounted for 58.4 % of extract; however,
    it was characterized by a very low content of phenolic compounds amounting to
    18.2 mg -catechin eq/g only.', 'Since crude extract of sunflower seeds was obtained
    using aqueous methanol, besides phenolic compounds, also soluble sugars might
    have been extracted.', The carbohydrates are eluted from Sephadex LH-20 column
    chromatography with methanol at the beginning of separation., Amarowicz et al.,
  and Arfan et al., noted low content of phenolic compounds in the first fractions
    obtained from chromatographic separation of crude extracts of legume seeds and
    Litsea monopetala bark on Sephadex LH-20., "Separation of sunflower seed crude
    extract using Sephadex LH-20 column chromatography; FCR FolinCiocalteus reagent\n\nYield
    of sunflower seed fractions and total phenolic content of individual fractions
    \ \n\nMeans with different superscript letters, within a column, are significantly
    different at P &lt; 0.05\n\nFractions IIVI were characterized by high total phenolic
    content.", 'The highest content was noted for fractions IV and V, 470 and 485
    mg -catechin eq/g, respectively.', The yields of those fractions were also appreciable.,
  'They accounted for 8.5 and 8.9 % of the total weight of extract, respectively.',
  'Generally, the total phenolic content of fractions IIVI was several times higher
    in comparison with fractions obtained from canola, everlasting pea, faba bean,
    broad bean, pea  and lentil seeds.', 'Since phenolic compounds of sunflower seeds
    comprise mainly 5-O-caffeoylquinic acid, the results of total phenolic content
    were additionally expressed as 5-O-caffeoylquinic acid eq.', The results obtained
    in that manner were approximately 1.4 times higher in comparison with those expressed
    as -catechin eq., 'A significant correlation, as determined by the Pearson test,
    was found between the content of phenolic compounds determined by FCR assay and
    sum of individual phenolic compounds quantified by HPLCMS.', "Pearsons correlation
    coefficients between total phenolic content, sum of phenolic compounds determined
    by HPLCMS and data obtained in antioxidant activity tests of sunflower seed fractions
    \ \n\nIn Table 3, the max of UV spectra and characteristic ions of phenolic compounds
    identified in the sunflower seed fractions are presented.", 'The trans-ferulic
    acid, 5-O-caffeoylquinic acid, quercetin rutinoside and quercetin glucuronide  were
    identified by comparison of their retention times and UV spectra with respective
    reference substances.', "The cis-ferulic acid  was identified in agreement with
    data from Dueas et al..\n\nmax of UV spectra and characteristic ions of phenolic
    compounds detected in fractions of sunflower seeds  \n\nThe presence of 5-O-caffeoylquinic
    acid  was confirmed by HPLCMS analysis.", 'This compound, present in all analyzed
    fractions, showed a deprotonated molecular ion  at a m/z of 353, main fragment
    ion at a m/z of 191  and a fragment ion at a m/z of 179  with low intensity, which
    is in accordance with literature data.', Compounds 3  and 4  produced similar
    parent ion at a m/z of 353 corresponding to the molecular formula C16H17O9., 'Since
    main fragment ions of those compounds were at a m/z of 191 and a m/z of 179  and
    a m/z of 173, they were assigned to 3-O-caffeoylquinic acid and 4-O-caffeoylquinic
    acid, respectively, taking into account the different intensity of the fragment
    ions.', 'The parent ion at a m/z of 337 was characteristic of compounds 6, 7,
    8.', 'They were identified as 3-O-p-coumaroylquinic acid, 4-O-p-coumaroylquinic
    acid  and 5-O-p-coumaroylquinic acid, due to the presence of the main fragment
    ions  at a m/z of 163,  at a m/z of 173 and  at a m/z of 191, respectively.',
  'The presence of four monoacyl quinic acids  was noted in sunflower seeds in previous
    analyses: three isomers of caffeoylquinic acid and 5-O-p-coumaroylquinic acid.',
  'However, to our knowledge, 3-O-p-coumaroylquinic acid and 4-O-p-coumaroylquinic
    acid were identified as sunflower seed phenolic compounds for the first time.',
  'Six compounds 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14 exhibiting a  ion at a m/z of 515 and fragment
    ions such as  at a m/z of 353,  at a m/z of 191,  at a m/z of 179,  at a m/z of
    173 and  at a m/z of 135 were assigned to dicaffeoylquinic acid isomers.', Aramendia
    et al., and Weisz et al., reported the presence of three dicaffeoylquinic acid
    isomers among phenolic compounds of sunflower seeds., 'They were identified as
    3,4-di-O-caffeoylquinic, 3,5-di-O-caffeoylquinic and 4,5-di-O-caffeoylquinic acids.',
  'In turn, Pedrosa et al.', 'noted the presence of four dicaffeoylquinic acid isomers
    in sunflower seeds: three aforementioned, and the other was presumably 1,5-di-O-caffeoylquinic
    acid.', 'The fragment ion at a m/z of 335 in the compounds 12 and 13 suggested
    the presence of the isomers 1,3-di-O-caffeoylquinic and 1,4-di-O-caffeoylquinic,
    reported by Clifford et al..', The compound 20 present in fraction II was identified
    as one of the caffeoylferuloylquinic acid isomers on the basis of  ion at a m/z
    of 529 and fragment ion at a m/z of 193., 'Among diacyl quinic acids, the presence
    of five caffeoyl-dimethoxycinnamoylquinic acid isomers was noted in sunflower
    seeds.', 'Isomers 15 and 16 were detected in fractions IIIV, and isomers 17, 18
    and 19 in fractions IVVI.', 'The identification was performed on the basis of
    the occurrence of deprotonated molecular ion  at a m/z of 543 and fragmentation
    of the parent ion, which was in accordance with literature data.', 'Heretofore,
    caffeoyl-dimethoxycinnamoylquinic acid isomers were not recognized as phenolic
    compounds of sunflower seeds.', 'Compounds 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 and 26 were tentatively
    identified as related to ferulic acid dehydrotrimers.', 'These compounds displayed
    a UV spectrum characteristic of ferulic acid-related structures, a fragment ion
    at a m/z of 193  and an ion  at a m/z of 563 which could correspond to different
    dehydrotriferulic acids.', 'In previous study on sunflower seeds phenolic compounds,
    Pedrosa et al.', 'noted the presence of compound showing a parent ion at a m/z
    of 563 with fragmentation yielded ions at m/z of 353, 191 and 179, but the authors
    did not identify the structure of that compound.', 'Among non-esterified phenolic
    compounds, only trans and cis isomers of ferulic acid  were identified in the
    fractions: trans-ferulic acid in fractions IIII, and cis-ferulic acid in IVVI.',
  Weisz et al., 'detected two non-esterified phenolic acids such as caffeic and ferulic
    using HPLCDAD/ESI-MSn analysis, whereas Pedrosa et al.', 'additionally found trace
    amounts of p-coumaric, p-hydroxybenzoic, protocatechuic and syringic acids by
    RP-HPLC analysis.', 'In the fractions from sunflower seeds, a few compounds belonging
    to flavonoids were also identified.', 'Compounds 27 and 28 due to the characteristic
    max of UV spectra and fragment ion at a m/z of 301  were classified as quercetin
    derivatives, with compound 28 being probably a diglycoside, but no further identifications
    were possible.', 'Fraction IV contained the quercetin rutinoside, and in fractions
    V and VI, one of quercetin glucuronide isomers  was identified due to the occurrence
    of deprotonated molecular ion  at a m/z of 477 and fragment ion at a m/z of 301.',
  'Furthermore, in fraction IV, a flavanone  with max of UV spectrum at 290 and 332
    nm was tentatively identified.', The contents of individual phenolic compounds
    identified in fractions of sunflower seeds are presented in Table 4., 'The 5-O-caffeoylquinic
    acid was the predominant compound in fractions I, II, III, IV and V. It accounted
    for 89.0, 94.9, 85.1, 93.4 and 95.8 % of the sum of phenolic compounds identified
    in individual fraction, respectively.', 'However, the content of 5-O-caffeoylquinic
    acid in those fractions varied from 6.98 to 308.9 mg/g.', 'It was calculated that
    5-O-caffeoylquinic acid present in fraction IV and V amounted to 47.6 mg/g of
    extract, which accounts for 76.1 % of total amount of that compound eluted from
    sunflower seeds extract loaded on Sephadex LH-20 column.', The other fractions
    contained from 1.4 to 5.2 mg of 5-O-caffeoylquinic acid per gram of extract.,
  The estimated content of 5-O-caffeoylquinic acid is in accordance with the literature.,
  Weisz et al., noted that this compound might comprise from 66 to 73 % of phenolic
    compounds extracted from defatted kernels of non-oilseeds and oilseeds of sunflower.,
  Pedrosa et al., obtained more diversified results ranging within 4371 % for kernels
    of different genotypes., 'In the present study, 5-O-caffeoylquinic acid was not
    the only predominant compound in fraction VI.', That constituent accounted for
    18.2 % of the sum of phenolic compounds of that fraction., Diacyl quinic acids
    dominated in fraction VI., They comprised 76.6 % of the sum of phenolic compounds
    of fraction VI., 'Among them, one of the dicaffeoylquinic acid isomers  and one
    of the caffeoyl-dimetoxycinnamoylquinic acids  were predominant.', Weisz et al.,
  'showed that the ratio of monocaffeoylquinic acids content to dicaffeoylquinic acids
    content for sunflower kernels ranged from 5.6:1 to 16.9:1.', 'The ratio of those
    compounds in our study was 17.5:1.', The majority  of ferulic acid dehydrotrimer
    isomers was noted in fraction III., This fraction contained also the highest amount
    of flavonoids and p-coumaroylquinic acid isomers., "Content of identified phenolic
    compounds in fractions of sunflower seeds   \n\nDPPH-scavenging activity of sunflower
    seed fractions is shown in Fig.", '2.', The fractions IIIVI at the highest concentration  inactivated
    more than 90 % of DPPH radicals., 'In turn, fractions I and II were much weaker
    scavengers of DPPH.', The amount of the fraction necessary to inhibit the initial
    DPPH by 50 %  was the lowest for fraction VI and amounted to 0.024., 'Fraction
    V was characterized by similar EC50 value, whereas fractions III and IV by higher
    values.', 'In the assay conditions, fractions I and II inhibited DPPH radicals
    by less than 50 %.', The ABTS cation radical-reducing ability of sunflower seed
    fractions was expressed as TEAC values and compiled in the Table 5., 'The TEAC
    values varied from 0.10 mmol Trolox eq/g for fraction I to 2.21 mmol Trolox eq/g
    for fraction V, and the ABTS+-reducing capacity was increasing in the following
    order: I &lt; II &lt; III  VI  IV &lt; V. The highest reducing power, similarly
    as the capacity to scavenge ABTS+, was noted for fraction V. Fractions IV and
    VI showed comparable ability to reduce Fe3+/ferricyanide complex to the ferrous
    form in the whole range of concentration/assay.', 'The reducing power determined
    for fractions I, II and III was lower in comparison with fractions V by 11, 4
    and 1.5 times, respectively.', The results of all applied methods of antioxidant
    activity testing were significantly correlated with the content of phenolic compounds
    in fractions., 'High Pearsons correlation coefficients were noted also between
    TEAC, reducing power and EC50 values.', "Scavenging effect of sunflower seed fractions
    on 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical \n\nABTS+scavenging activity expressed
    as Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity  and DPPH-scavenging activity expressed
    as EC50 values of sunflower seed fractions  \n\nMeans with different superscript
    letters, within a column, are significantly different at P &lt; 0.05\n\nSince
    5-O-caffeoylquinic acid is a major phenolic constituent of fractions IV, their
    antioxidant activity  can be attributed to this compound.", It is well known that
    5-O-caffeoylquinic acid is able to scavenge free radicals and inhibit oxidation
    of various lipid substrates., Its antioxidant activity is comparable to or only
    slightly lower  than the activity of caffeic acid and significantly higher than
    other hydroxycinnamic acids., 'It is determined by the structure of 5-O-caffeoylquinic
    acid, which similarly to caffeic acid contains two OH groups bound to an aromatic
    ring in the ortho position.', It is known that a catechol group in flavonoid and
    phenolic acid structures is essential for their free radical-scavenging and metal
    chelating activities., 'Consequently, it is not surprising that dicaffeoylquinic
    acids, containing two catechol groups in the structure, are characterized by higher
    antioxidant activity than that of chlorogenic acid.', 'On the other hand, Kim
    et al.', compared antioxidant activity of five various dicaffeoylquinic acid derivatives
    that have non-esterified OH groups in catechol structures., These compounds were
    characterized by similar  DPPH-scavenging activity and inhibition of formation
    of cholesteryl ester hydroperoxide during copper ion-induced rat blood plasma
    oxidation., 'Therefore, the activity of those compounds is not connected with
    the presence or absence of the olefinic double bond or with the binding position
    of caffeic and dihydrocaffeic acids to the quinic acid.', 'In our study, dicaffeoylquinic
    acid isomers were present mainly in fraction VI, and it seems that those compounds
    mainly determined the high antioxidant activity and reducing power of this fraction.',
  The second group of compounds abundant in fraction VI was caffeoyl-dimethoxycinnamoylquinic
    acid isomers., 'To the best of our knowledge, the antioxidant activity of those
    compounds has not been studied so far.', 'It seems that due to esterification
    of OH groups in the catechol structure, they might exert lower antioxidant effect
    than caffeoyl-dimethoxycinnamoylquinic acid isomers.', 'On the other hand, high
    correlations between the sum of phenolic compounds in fractions and the results
    of antioxidant tests  might be indicative of possible high antiradical activity
    and reducing power of caffeoyl-dimethoxycinnamoylquinic acid isomers.', 'In the
    presented study, we fractionated crude extract of sunflower seeds using Sephadex
    LH-20 column chromatography with methanol as a mobile phase.', This step enabled
    us to identify and quantify phenolic compounds that were not noted before in sunflower
    seeds., 'Until now, researchers identified non-esterified phenolic acids, isomers
    of caffeoylquinic acid, p-coumaroylquinic acid and dicaffeoylquinic acids in sunflower
    seeds.', 'In our research, we additionally found new isomers of coumaroylquinic
    acid  and dicaffeoylquinic acids.', 'Moreover, caffeoyl-dimethoxycinnamoylquinic
    acid isomers and few compounds belonging to flavonoids were tentatively identified.',
  'The results of ABTS, DPPH and Fe3+/ferricyanide assays showed good correlations
    between each other and with phenolic content of individual fraction of sunflower
    seeds.', 'The determination of antiradical activity and reducing power of individual
    fractions, containing different types of phenolic compounds, enables the conclusion
    that not only predominant 5-O-caffeoylquinic acid contributes to the high antioxidant
    activity of sunflower seeds, but also isomers of dicaffeoylquinic acid and caffeoyl-dimethoxycinnamoylquinic
    acid.', 'It seems that this information can be useful for utilization of sunflower
    cake, by-product of oil extraction, as functional food component or as antioxidant
    supplement.', 'This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons
