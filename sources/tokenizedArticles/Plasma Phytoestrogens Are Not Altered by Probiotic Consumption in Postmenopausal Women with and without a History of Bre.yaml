text: [Soy phytoestrogens were suggested to reduce the risk of a number of diseases
    including breast cancer., 'Given that these compounds are metabolized by bacteria,
    alteration of intestinal bacteria and enzymes may affect phytoestrogen metabolism.',
  'We hypothesized that probiotics, when consumed with soy protein, would increase
    plasma isoflavones, as well as equol producer frequency, in postmenopausal women.',
  We further hypothesized that these effects would differ between women who have had
    breast cancer and women who have not., 'To test these hypotheses, 20 breast cancer
    survivors and 20 controls completed four 6-wk treatments in a randomized, crossover
    design: supplementation with soy protein  ; soy + probiotics   colony-forming
    units Lactobacillus acidophilus DDS+1 and Bifidobacterium longum, 15-30 mg fructooligosaccharide/d);
    milk protein  ; and milk + probiotics.', 'Plasma phytoestrogen concentrations
    did not differ between controls and survivors, although genistein tended to be
    lower in survivors at baseline, and during soy  and milk protein  consumption.',
  'As expected, soy consumption increased plasma phytoestrogen concentrations.', Plasma
    phytoestrogen concentrations and the number of equol producers did not differ
    between the S and S+P diets., 'At the same time, plasma equol concentrations as
    well as urinary equol excretion in 2 subjects were more than 7-fold different
    between the 2 diets.', 'These results indicate that this particular probiotic
    supplement does not generally affect plasma isoflavones, although the large differences
    between plasma and urinary equol in some subjects suggest that equol producer
    status may be modifiable in some individuals.']
