text: ['Cisplatin is one of the mostly used antineoplastic drugs in the treatment
    of cancer, but its clastogenic potential has become of great interest.', 'In patients
    treated with long-term cisplatin, genetic damage can be observed during chemotherapy
    or many years later.', 'The aim of this study was to investigate the possible
    anticlastogenic effect of pretreatment with olive, extra virgin olive, canola
    or corn oils on cisplatin-induced chromosomal aberrations in Wistar rat bone marrow
    cells.', 'The animals received pretreatment with a single dose of vegetable oils  by
    gavage before cisplatin i.p., and were sacrificed 24 h after cisplatin injection.',
  'The pretreatment with a single dose of olive, extra virgin olive and canola oils
    caused a statistically significant decrease in the total of chromosomal aberrations
    and abnormal metaphases induced by cisplatin when compared with the groups treated
    with cisplatin alone.', 'The possible explanation for the anticlastogenic effects
    observed in the pretreatment with olive, extra virgin olive and canola oils is
    ascribed to the oil contents.', 'In conclusion, from the findings we suggest that
    these oils have some antioxidant effect, and the anticlastogenesis mechanisms
    of these oils need to be explored further before their use during cisplatin chemotherapy.']
