text: [Insulin-like growth factor 1  is an anabolic hormone important for growth and
    development., 'However, high-circulating serum concentrations in adults are associated
    with increased risk of postmenopausal breast cancer.', Nutritional status and
    specific foods influence serum IGF-1 concentrations., Breast cancer incidence
    is typically low in Asian countries where soy is commonly consumed., 'Paradoxically,
    soy supplement trials in American women have reported significant increases in
    IGF-1.', Seaweed also is consumed regularly in Asian countries where breast cancer
    risk is low., We investigated the possibility that seaweed could modify soy-associated
    increases in IGF-1 in American women., 'Thirty healthy postmenopausal women  participated
    in this 14-wk double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover clinical
    trial.', Participants consumed 5 g/day placebo or seaweed  in capsules for 7 wk.,
  'During the 7th wk, a high-soy protein isolate powder was added.', Overnight fasting
    blood samples were collected after each intervention period., Soy significantly
    increased serum IGF-1 concentrations compared to the placebo., The combination
    of seaweed and soy significantly reduced this increase by about 40%., Concurrent
    seaweed and soy consumption may be important in modifying the effect of soy on
    IGF-1 serum concentrations.]
