text: [Evidence suggests that higher plasma carotenoid concentrations are protective
    in relation to breast cancer recurrence., This simple randomized carrot juice
    intervention study was designed to test the hypothesis that daily intake of 8
    ounces of fresh BetaSweet  or Balero orange carrot juice would increase plasma
    total carotenoid concentrations to levels previously shown to be associated with
    reduced breast cancer recurrence., It was hypothesized that regular carrot juice
    intake would be associated with reductions in oxidative stress  and inflammation.,
  Sixty-nine overweight breast cancer survivors consumed fresh carrot juice made from
    study-provided carrots for 3 wk., 'Total plasma carotenoids increased by 1.65
    and 1.38 umol/L for the BetaSweet and Balero carrot juice, respectively.', 'Rise
    in total plasma carotenoids for the overall sample was inversely associated with
    8-iso-PGF (OR: 0.13; 95% CI: 0.20 to 0.75; no differences were shown by carrot
    variety.', 'These results suggest daily intake of fresh carrot juice is a simple
    and effective approach to increasing plasma total carotenoids and in turn reducing
    oxidative stress, but not inflammatory markers, in women previously treated for
    breast cancer.']
