text: ['The soybean-derived protease inhibitor, Bowman-Birk inhibitor, is currently
    showing great promise as a novel cancer chemopreventive agent.', 'In contrast
    to the wealth of research conducted on this compound, the anticancer effects of
    protease inhibitors isolated from other leguminous sources have received limited
    attention.', 'In the current study, 7 protease inhibitor concentrates  were isolated
    from various leguminous sources  and characterized.', The effects of PICs on the
    proliferation of breast and prostate cancer cells were investigated in vitro.,
  Chickpea PIC significantly inhibited the viability of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer and
    PC-3 and LNCaP prostate cancer cells at all concentrations tested., 'In addition,
    kidney bean, soybean, and mungbean  PICs inhibited LNCaP cell viability.', These
    findings suggest that leguminous PICs may possess similar anticancer properties
    to that of soybean BBI and deserve further study as possible chemopreventive agents.]
