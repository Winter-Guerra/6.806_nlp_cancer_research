text: [Establishing n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid contents in canned wild Alaska
    pink salmon products is challenging due to ample natural variation found in lipid
    content of pink salmon muscle., 'This study investigated the effect of adding
    salmon oil  to canned pink salmon produced from fish exhibiting two opposite degrees
    of skin watermarking, bright  and dark.', 'Specific goals of the study were to
    evaluate the benefits of adding SO to canned pink salmon with regard to nutritional
    value of the product, sensory characteristics, and the oxidative and hydrolytic
    stability of the lipids over thermal processing.', 'Six groups of canned pink
    salmon were produced with variable levels of SO, either using bright  or dark  pink
    salmon.', Compositional analysis revealed highest  lipid content in sample B2  and
    lowest  lipid content in sample D0., 'Lipid content of samples B0, B1, D2, and
    D4 was not significantly different  ranging from 5.7% to 6.8%.', 'Consequently,
    addition of SO to canned pink salmon allowed for consistent lipid content between
    bright and dark fish.', Addition of 1% or 2% SO to canned bright pink salmon was
    not detrimental to the sensory properties of the product., 'It is recommended
    that canned bright pink salmon be supplemented with at least 1% SO, while supplementation
    with 2% SO would guarantee a minimum quantity of 1.9 g of n-3 fatty acids per
    100 g of product.', 'Addition of 4% SO to canned dark pink salmon was detrimental
    to product texture and taste, while supplementation with 2% SO did not negatively
    affect sensorial properties of the product.', 'Accordingly, canned dark pink salmon
    should be supplemented with 2% SO so that a minimum n-3 fatty acids content of
    1.5 g per 100 g of product.', 'In Alaska, pink salmon annual harvests averaged
    175,000 t from 2005 to 2009, comprising about half of the total salmon catch.',
  'Approximately, 55% of the pink salmon catch volume is processed into cans.', 'Between
    2000 and 2004, U.S. consumption of Pacific salmon species averaged 284,000 tons,
    16% of which was canned salmon.', 'Canned salmon is a staple of U.S. diet  with
    domestic consumption upwards of 60,000 tons on years of high catch volumes.',
  Canned salmon is also exported to Europe and Asia and is a staple food item in the
    United Kingdom and Japan., 'During the past decade, consumer awareness regarding
    the need to increase dietary intake of long chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids  has
    increased significantly.', Research has shown that daily consumption of fatty
    fish or fish oil containing these fatty acids reduces risk of coronary disease
    and decrease progression of atherosclerosis in coronary patients., Balk et al.,
  indicated that evidence supports a dose-dependent effect of fish oil on reducing
    levels of serum triglycerides and cholesterol., 'These fatty acids may also benefit
    treatment and prevention of systemic inflammatory diseases, such as ulcerative
    colitis, psoriasis, and rheumatoid arthritis.', 'Additional studies suggest that
    LC n-3 PUFA may reduce risk of progression of psychotic disorders, such as schizophrenia,
    in young people with subthreshold psychotic states.', 'Richardson  reported on
    the potential effects of LC n-3 PUFA on patients displaying symptoms of attention
    deficit/hyperactivity disorder, while SanGiovanni and Chew  described the role
    of LC n-3 PUFA in health and disease of the retina.', 'Despite the many health
    benefits attributed to LC n-3 PUFA, controversy exists on their potential effects
    on reducing cancer risk.', Larsson et al., described several mechanisms of action
    of LC n-3 PUFA in modifying the carcinogenic process., MacLean et al., conducted
    a systematic study that synthesized published and unpublished evidence in this
    area and concluded that no significant associations between LC n-3 PUFA consumption
    and cancer incidence were found for numerous types of cancers., 'Pink salmon is
    high in protein and a good source of LC n-3 PUFA, especially of 20:5n-3  and 22:6n-3.',
  'Nonetheless, there is high natural variability in the lipid content of wild Alaska
    pink salmon, which vary from 2% up to 9%.', 'High natural variability in the lipid
    content of wild salmon makes the disclosure of LC n-3 PUFA content, and in particular
    of EPA and DHA contents, in the product nutritional label difficult.', The main
    cause of variability of lipid content in wild Pacific salmon is sexual maturity
    and spawning migration., 'During spawning migration, the feeding activity of Pacific
    salmon decreases and stored lipids are used as energy, and this causes a decrease
    in total lipid content of muscle as fish near spawning.', 'Concomitantly, the
    lipid-soluble pigments responsible for the natural rose to orange color of salmon
    fillets migrate from flesh to skin, and in the case of females to the eggs.',
  'Migration of pigments from flesh to skin cause a skin blushing effect, ordinarily
    referred to as skin watermarking.', 'Alaska seafood processors use degree of skin
    watermarking as one of the grading parameters for Pacific salmon species, separating
    fish within each species as bright, semi-bright, and dark.', 'Dark fish, most
    prevalent in the commercial catch during the late part of the salmon run, are
    also designated as pale-meat salmon because of the absence of the naturally occurring
    pigments in the flesh of heavily skin-watermarked fish.', Huynh and Mackey  conducted
    a quality study of late-run chum salmon and noted that muscle quality is greatly
    impacted by the biochemical changes that occur during spawning migration., 'Late-run
    salmon muscle often has less desirable texture and flavor, flesh softness, poor
    taste, and develops a distinct late-odor that reduces value of the product.',
  'When compared with canned pink salmon produced from bright grade A fish, pale-meat
    canned pink salmon had a distinct profile of chemical volatiles; notwithstanding,
    a specific chemical compound that imparted late-odor notes to product was not
    readily identifiable.', 'In the early days of the Alaska salmon industry, canning
    often included the addition of salmon oil  rendered from salmon heads.', 'However,
    in the late 1960s, most canned salmon processors in Alaska discontinued this practice,
    and production of SO for human use ceased.', 'In the last decade, growing interest
    in fish oils due to their nutritional benefit has increased the price of this
    commodity, prompting a revival of edible SO production in Alaska.', 'Pacific salmon
    stores lipids in their head and content of oil, despite variable between species,
    may be as high as 16% w/w.', 'Salmon heads are a major byproduct of salmon processing,
    and currently the production of edible SO in Alaska is a lucrative business.',
  'SO produced in Alaska contains about 65-93 mg/g oil EPA and 74-102 mg/g oil DHA,
    and is the only optional ingredient other than salt permitted by the standard
    of identity for canned Pacific salmon by the Code of Federal Regulation.', 'Adding
    SO to canned Alaska pink salmon will boost the lipid content of heavily watermarked
    fish, or pale-meat pink salmon, improving its nutritional value and product consistency.',
  'This study investigated the effect of adding Alaska edible wild SO to canned Alaska
    pink salmon produced from fish exhibiting two opposite degrees of skin watermarking,
    bright and dark.', 'Specific goals of the study were to evaluate the benefits
    of adding SO to canned pink salmon with regard to nutritional value of the product,
    sensorial characteristics, and the oxidative stability of the lipids over thermal
    processing.', 'A total of 250 pink salmon  were procured from a processing plant
    in Kodiak, Alaska.', 'Fish were seine-caught near Afognak Island, Kodiak Archipelago,
    Alaska, during the summer of 2008.', 'Of which, 125 pink salmon exhibited no signs
    of skin watermarking and were commercially graded as grade A bright fish, while
    the remaining 125 pink salmon procured were heavily skin-watermarked and received
    a commercial graded of dark.', Fish were less than 24 h postmortem and gutted
    using an iron butcher at the commercial plant., Fish were brought in iced totes
    to the Kodiak Seafood and Marine Science  pilot plant and canned the same day.,
  'A quantity of 15 L of human-grade SO, rendered from salmon heads during summer
    of 2008, was procured from a SO processor  in August of 2008.', 'Bright pink salmon
    were cut into 215 g steaks and placed in 307  200.25 cans with 3 g NaCl and 0,
    1, or 2%  human-grade Alaska SO, and mirrored standard commercial salmon canning
    practices in Alaska.', 'Dark pink salmon were processed in identical fashion;
    however, the levels of SO added to cans were 0, 2, or 4%.', The cans were filled
    at room temperature., 'The total weight of SO added was converted to the corresponding
    volume using product density, 0.9 g/mL, and values were rounded off such that
    1, 2, and 4% corresponded to 2.5, 5, and 10 mL, respectively.', 'The two-piece
    cans were vacuum-sealed, retorted at 120C for 69 min and water-cooled.', 'A total
    of 960 cans of pink salmon, 160 for each of the six treatments, were produced.',
  'The treatments were canned bright pink salmon with 0%, 1%, and 2%  human-grade
    SO, and canned dark pink salmon with 0%, 2%, and 4%  human-grade SO.', 'After
    8-10 months of storage at room temperature, 24 canned pink salmon samples were
    randomly selected from each of the six groups  for chemical analyses.', 'Two cans
    within a treatment  were homogenized at a time, using a Waring Commercial laboratory
    blender, to produce one sample that contained approximately 450 g of product,
    which was sufficient material to conduct all chemical analyses planned.', 'Therefore,
    12 sample replicates were produced from each of the six treatments, each composed
    of contents from two identical salmon cans.', Samples were individually frozen
    to 30C overnight in a tray placed in a walk-in freezer., Frozen samples were placed
    in the freeze drier  and maintained at 30C for 30 min then at 40C for 30 min with
    a condenser temperature of 50C and chamber pressure of 53.33 kPa., 'The primary
    freeze drying parameters for shelf temperature and drying time were 40C for 6
    h, 30C for 5 h, 20C for 4 h, 10C for 3 h, and 0C for 2 h, all under 8 Pa.', The
    secondary drying was set at 25C for 3 h at 8 Pa., The freeze-drying process took
    24 h and was based on processing parameters established for pink salmon fillets.,
  The freeze-dried samples removed from the freeze-drier chamber and immediately comminuted
    to powder using a Mr. Coffee IDS-50 coffee grinder., 'A quantity of 0.5 g of sample
    from each tray was used to measure water activity, which was determined using
    an AquaLab water activity meter.', 'Upon verification that all samples had water
    activity equal or below 0.2, samples were vacuum packaged  and promptly frozen
    at 30C until chemically analyzed.', 'A total of 12 samples from each sample group,
    each containing the entire contents of two identical cans of pink salmon, were
    used for analysis.', 'Moisture content was the only parameter measured for wet
    samples, while moisture, ash, protein, and lipid contents were determined using
    the freeze-dried samples counterparts.', 'Moisture and ash contents were determined
    using Official Methods of Analysis of AOAC International  methods #952.08 and
    #938.08, respectively.', 'Nitrogen content was accessed by pyrolysis, as described
    in AOAC method 968.06 with a LECO FP-2000 nitrogen analyzer, and protein content
    was calculated as 6.25 times % N. Lipids were determined gravimetrically using
    an ASE200 Accelerated Solvent Extractor  using an adaptation to the procedure
    previously described by Oliveira et al..', 'Approximately, 4-5 g of freeze-dried
    samples were mixed with an equal amount of hydromatrix, and accurate sample weights
    were recorded using an analytical balance.', The mixture was placed in a 33 mL
    extraction cell with a cellulose filter and quartz sand  to fill dead-volume at
    both ends of the cell., 'Lipids were extracted using dichloromethane as solvent,
    and the extraction parameters were 1500 psi pressure, 100C, and three static cycles
    of 5 min extraction for each sample producing a total of 50-55 mL extracted volume.',
  'For the lipid yield data, the solvent extract collected in a preweighed 60 mL collection
    vial was dried at 40C under a stream of nitrogen until constant weight using a
    Turbovap LV.', 'Extracted lipids were dissolved in hexane with 0.01% butylated
    hydroxytoluene, at a ratio of about 1:10, and kept at 80C until further analysis.',
  'Proximate composition data, reported on a wet weight basis, was calculated using
    moisture content of wet samples, and lipid, protein and ash contents determined
    in their freeze-dried counterparts.', The proximate composition values on a wet
    weight basis were also adjusted using the moisture contents of each of the freeze-dried
    samples to the moisture level of the corresponding sample determined from wet
    tissues., 'A total of 12 freeze-dried samples from each sample group, each containing
    the entire contents of two identical cans of pink salmon, were used for analysis.',
  One gram of freeze-dried sample was weighed into 9-mL screw-capped test tube and
    8 mL of deionized water added., The contents were mixed for 1 min using a mini
    vortexer  then centrifuged at 2000 rpm using a Centra CL2 Thermo IEC benchtop
    centrifuge  for 30 min., 'The supernatant liquid was isolated and diluted 1:15
    with deionized water.', The resulting mixture was analyzed for salt content using
    an M926 Chloride Analyzer  and reported as mg/100 g of wet sample., 'Fatty acid
    methyl esters were prepared, in duplicates, using 20 mg of lipids extracted with
    the ASE200 from each freeze-dried sample, which had been extracted.', 'Fatty acid
    methyl esters were also prepared, in duplicates, using 20 mg of SO.', The esterification
    procedure followed the method described by Maxwell and Marmer  using 1 mg of tricosanoic
    acid methyl ester as internal standard., Fatty acid methyl esters were transferred
    into 1.5-mL snap-cap amber vials  and immediately analyzed using a gas chromatographer  model
    6850  fitted with a DB-23  capillary column., Hydrogen was used as the carrier
    gas at a constant flow of 1.0 mL/min and average velocity of 30 cm/sec., 'The
    initial nominal inlet pressure was 15.26 psi, total flow was 58.6 mL/min, and
    temperature was 250C.', 'The inlet was operated in split mode at 50:1 ratio, and
    the oven programming was as follows: 140-180C at 2C/min, 180-200C at 2.5C/min,
    200-210C at 0.5C/min, and 210-230C at 10C/min.', Total analysis time was 50 min.,
  The GC was coupled to a flame ionization detector operated at 275C., 'Detector make-up
    gas flow was 35 mL N2/min, and air and hydrogen flows were 450 mL/min and 40 mL/min,
    respectively.', 'An auto-sampler performed the GC injections of standards and
    samples, and injection volume was 1 L. Data were collected and analyzed using
    the GC ChemStation program.', 'Identification of peaks was performed using the
    following Supelco  standards: Marine Oil #1, Marine Oil #3, S189-19, and Bacterial
    Acid Methyl Esters Mix.', Results were determined as milligrams of fatty acids
    per gram of oil then converted to mg/100 g of product  based on the fat content
    of the sample., 'Lipid hydrolysis and lipid oxidation parameters were determined,
    in duplicates, for canned pink salmon samples and for the SO  using American Oil
    Chemists Society methods.', 'The free fatty acid values, peroxide values, and
    2-thiobarbituric acid  followed AOCS methods # Ca 5a-40, Cd 8-53, and Cd 19-90,
    respectively.', A group of eight people  from the University of Alaska Seafood
    Science Graduate Program  defined the attributes used during the Consumer Test
    during a preliminary sensory evaluation of the canned pink salmon samples., 'The
    group tasted and smelled samples from each of the six treatments  and determined
    attributes most relevant in the samples to be appearance, color, overall taste,
    saltiness, bitterness, fattiness, fish flavor, and texture.', The main sensory
    evaluation conducted was a consumer attribute analysis  test as previously described
    by Oliveira et al.., 'The CAA test was conducted in October of 2008 at the University
    of Alaska Fairbanks  campus, Fairbanks, with the assistance of the Cooperative
    Extension Service  personnel of UAF.', 'The panelists were community members of
    Fairbanks, and students, staff, and faculty of UAF ranging in age from 18 to 80
    years old.', 'The age average of participants was 31 years old, the ratio of females
    to males was approximately 1:1.5 and about 8% of the participants did not disclose
    gender information.', 'Panelists were selected based on their liking of fish and
    fishery products and their frequency of eating fish, which should be at least
    twice a month.', 'Unstructured scales  with verbal anchors on both ends were used,
    and instruction on the use the scale was given to each panelist.', 'Each can of
    sample was opened and the liquid, commercially designated as canned salmon liquor,
    was poured equally into four plastic cups with lids.', Canned pink salmon steak
    was divided into four equal parts and placed into the cups with their respective
    portioned liquor., Unsalted crackers and commercial bottled water were provided
    for palate rinsing., The panelists were asked to evaluate the samples from left
    to right., Panelists rated samples based on the sensory attributes requested by
    placing a vertical line anywhere within the scale where they thought best described
    the sample., The panelists scores were determined by measuring the length  with
    a ruler from the left verbal anchor to the vertical line placed by the panelist
    for each sample code., 'Scores were recorded up to 1 decimal place with 0 and
    15 as lower and upper limits, respectively, for all attributes.', 'The CAA Test
    was conducted through four consecutive days, and in day 1 and day 2, product comparisons
    carried out were B0 versus B1 versus B2  and D0 versus D1 versus D2, respectively.',
  'In day 1 and 2, each participant received one tray containing three sample cups.',
  'In day 3, two separate product comparisons were conducted, B0 versus D0  and B1
    versus D2, and each panelist received two separate trays each containing two sample
    cups.', Order of presentation for first and second sample pairs was randomized.,
  'Similarly, in day 4, two separate product comparisons were conducted, B2 versus
    D4  and B2 versus D4.', 'In day 1 and 2 of the CAA test, approximately 90 cans
    of salmon were used each day, while in days 3 and 4 about 120 cans were used each
    day.', 'In total, the CAA test required approximately 420 cans of salmon.', Significant
    differences between canned salmon groups were determined using one-way analysis
    of variance  followed by Tukeys Honestly Significance Difference Test., All analyses
    were conducted using Statistica version 8.0., Results for chemical analysis are
    reported as weighted means  and respective standard deviations for each canned
    salmon group., Results for sensory analysis are reported as the average of sensory
    scores and respective standard deviations., The aW values were below 0.2 for all
    freeze-dried samples., 'The average moisture contents of freeze-dried samples
    were 3.0% for B0, 3.0% for B1, 2.3% for B2, 2.6% for D0, 2.7% for D2, and 4.1%
    for D4.', 'For canned bright and dark Alaska pink salmon with different levels
    of SO, protein content was significantly lower  in D4 and highest in B0, while
    ash content was lowest in B0 and highest in D0, D2, and D4.', 'The principal variations
    were observed in the moisture and lipid contents, which were inversely related.',
  'Moisture content was significantly higher  in D0 and lowest in B2, while lipid
    content was significantly higher  in B2 and lowest in D0.', The addition of 4%
    SO  was expected to have the highest lipid content or at least equivalent to B2.,
  'Due to the variation in the intrinsic qualities between individual fish from the
    same run, the lipid contents of B0, B1, D2, and D4 were not significantly different.',
  This finding supports observation that pink salmon show a decrease in lipid content
    as they stop feeding during spawning., The lipid content of canned dark pink salmon
    with added SO  showed no significant difference  to canned bright pink salmon
    without added SO., 'More importantly, this implied that 2% or 4% SO added prior
    to commercial canning of dark fish would result in consistent lipid content in
    the product.', 'Shostrom et al., studying traditional canned pink salmon  obtained
    from nine different districts in Alaska at the end of the canning season, suggested
    a wide variation in lipid content.', 'Similarly, 5-13% lipid content was determined
    in traditional cans produced during early and late pink salmon runs from the north
    and south coasts of British Columbia.', 'Also, traditional canned pink salmon
    produced by three different processors in Japan, in October 1987 and June and
    November 1988, had 4-15% lipid content.', These reports imply a variation in the
    sexual maturity of the pink salmon sample and the lipid contents of B0 and D0
    in the present study confirmed the hypothesis., 'Furthermore, the lipid contents  for
    two commercial samples of traditional canned pink salmon purchased from Lafayette,
    IN stores  were within the range observed for B0 and D0.', 'The USDA  data for
    canned pink salmon, solids with bone and liquid, were 74.04% moisture, 4.97% lipid,
    19.68% protein, and 1.31% ash and were close to the values given in Table 1.',
  'Aside from pink salmon, other species of salmon are canned.', 'Coho salmon, following
    a traditional canning method used in villages in interior Alaska, showed a low
    2% lipid content and high 6% ash content.', 'In their study, spawning coho salmon
    were harvested and brined before canning, which allowed uptake of moisture in
    fillets and making lipid content proportionally lower.', Farmed coho salmon  canned
    in sunflower oil resulted in higher lipid content  than unsupplemented product.,
  Sockeye salmon  from two different processors in Japan contain 7-8% lipid in the
    cans., 'Other commercially canned fish species contain lipids ranging from 6%
    to 8% for light tuna, 5% to 6% for white and albacore tuna, and 4% to 5% for mackerel.',
  The salt content in pink salmon cans ranged from 1.36% to 1.63% of the total wet
    weight of the cans., 'There were significant differences detected, and D2 had
    the highest salt content while B0 had the lowest.', 'Overall, the 0.27% salt content
    difference between highest and lowest values is relatively small, and significant
    differences reflect precision of the measurement.', The range in salt content
    observed in this study is slightly higher than the 0.8-1.4% for commercial British
    Columbia canned pink salmon., 'In their study, 1.8-2 g of salt were added per
    213 g can of salmon compared with the 3 g of salt per 215 g can of salmon in this
    study, which followed Alaska salmon canning industry practices.', 'Table 2 shows
    the fatty acid profile for SO, which was typical of commercial Alaska SO.', The
    fatty acid profiles of canned bright and dark pink salmon are also presented in
    Table 2., 'Among the saturated fatty acids, palmitic acid  was the most abundant,
    with B2 having the significantly highest  value and D0 the lowest.', 'The palmitic
    acid content of samples B0, B1, D2, and D4 was not significantly different from
    each other.', 'The most abundant monounsaturated fatty acid  found in all samples
    was oleic acid, with B2 having the highest concentration and D0 the lowest.',
  'Cetoleic acid  and gadoleic acid  were second and third, respectively, in abundance
    among the MUFAs in all samples.', These two fatty acids are exogenous in origin
    and the concentrations in salmon reflect feeding activity., Cetoleic and gadoleic
    acids were significantly lowest  in D0 indicating a decrease in feeding activity
    of pink salmon during spawning., The two most abundant LC n-3 PUFA in the canned
    pink salmon were DHA and EPA., 'The DHA content was most abundant in B2 and least
    abundant in D0, while not significantly different  among B0, B1, D2, and D4.',
  The control and supplemented samples from this study had lower DHA content than
    the 1300-1400 mg/100 g for canned pink salmon  from British Columbia., 'The DHA
    content of B0, B1, B2, and D2 is in the range reported for commercially canned
    pink salmon  purchased in Indiana, and for canned salmon purchased in Japan which
    contained 575-906 mg DHA/100 g of product.', The EPA content was significantly
    highest  in B2 and lowest in D0 but all samples were lower as compared with previous
    reports on canned pink salmon., 'The British Columbia product contains 700-900
    mg EPA/100 g of product, while two of the three purchased products from Japan
    contained 1200-1300 mg EPA/100 g of product  and was close to those for B0, B1,
    D0, D2, and D4.', 'The DHA:EPA showed D0 having the significantly highest  value
    while B2 and D4 shared the lowest ratio.', 'Some studies suggest that DHA may
    be more cardio-protective than EPA and being more effective in lowering postprandial
    triglyceride levels, slowing the resting pulse rate, and decreasing blood pressure.',
  'British Columbia canned pink salmon  had 1.7-1.8 DHA:EPA, which was similar to
    B0, B1, and D2.', 'Lower DHA to EPA ratios  were recorded for canned pink salmon
    purchased in Indiana, and the range of 0.6-0.8 for two of three types of canned
    pink salmon purchased in Japan.', 'A third sample of canned pink salmon purchased
    in Japan had a DHA:EPA of 2, which was similar to that for D0.', 'Compared with
    other species of canned salmon, the DHA to EPA ratios of 1.5-2 for canned sockeye
    salmon from Japan  are similar with that of pink salmon from this study.', 'On
    the other hand, canned coho salmon from interior Alaska showed a higher DHA:EPA
    of 2.4.', The majority of commercial canned light tuna and albacore tuna purchased
    in Indiana has a higher DHA to EPA ratio ranging from 3 to 8., 'However, the EPA
    and DHA contents for canned tuna were lower than those determined from this study
    and were 32-58 mg/100 g of product and 181-300 mg/100 g of product, respectively,
    except for one sample of canned albacore tuna with 190 mg EPA/100 g of product
    and 741 mg DHA/100 g of product.', 'Canned mackerel purchased in Indiana has a
    lower DHA:EPA of 1.2-1.3  than that of the canned pink salmon in this study.',
  The summary of fatty acid classes for SO and canned bright and dark pink salmon
    are shown in Table 3., 'The most abundant fatty acid class in all samples was
    MUFA, which was highest in B2, lowest in D0, and not significantly different  between
    B0, B1, D2, and D4.', 'Least abundant among fatty acid classes was SAT, ranging
    from 0.5 to 1.4 g/100 g of product.', This range was low considering that the
    American Heart Association  recommendation is ;16 g saturated fat intake per day  for
    cardiovascular disease risk reduction in the general population., Canned pink
    salmon can be an important component of a healthy diet to reduce risk of death
    from coronary arterial disease., 'Conversely, n-3 fatty acids contents of the
    samples were high having an abundance of 1.9 g/100 g of product in B2 and 0.7
    g/100 g of product in D0, the difference of which was significant.', Simopoulos
    et al., recommend an Adequate Intake  of EPA+DHA for adults of 650 mg/day., 'Applied
    to this study, 100 g of product of each of the canned samples could provide the
    AI for EPA+DHA except for D0, which gave the lowest EPA+DHA value.', 'Sample B2
    had a significantly higher  EPA+DHA value, while samples B0, B1, D2, and D4 were
    not significantly different.', 'In addition, AHA recommends consumption of 1 g
    of EPA+DHA per day for patients with documented coronary heart disease.', 'Consumption
    of 100 g per day of B2, as well as samples B0, B1, D2, and D4 can provide adequate
    EPA+DHA requirement for patients with documented coronary heart disease.', 'In
    summary, conventionally canned bright pink salmon  may provide the AI for EPA+DHA
    for adults and AHAs recommendation for daily intake for patients with coronary
    heart disease, while canned unsupplemented dark fish  may not.', 'The significant
    difference between the EPA+DHA values of B0 and D0 reflects the natural variation,
    thus inconsistent lipid-related composition and nutritional quality of canned
    pink salmon.', This variation can become a concern if consumption of canned pink
    salmon is recommended as part of coronary heart disease patients diets., 'In this
    study, the concern was resolved with the addition of SO to canned dark pink salmon.',
  'The EPA+DHA values for traditional canned pink salmon determined from other studies
    were higher: 2.1-2.3 g/100 g of drained meat product from British Columbia, 0.9-2.1
    g/100 g and 1.5-1.8 g/100 g of product from those purchased in Japan  and Indiana,
    respectively.', 'In comparison, canned coho salmon had 0.5 g of EPA+DHA/100 g
    of product, while canned sockeye from Japan had 1.3-1.4 g/100 g of product.',
  'Other canned fish species contained 0.1-0.3 g/100 g of product for light tuna,
    0.2-0.9 g/100 g of product for albacore tuna, and 0.5-1.2 g/100 g of product for
    mackerel.', Lipid hydrolysis and oxidative stability analyses showed that the
    SO added to the canned pink salmon had not undergone significant deterioration
    during rendering or storage., 'The PV and FFA values for SO  were within the recommended
    quality guidelines for food-grade fish oil: 3-20 meq/kg for PV and 1-7% for FFA.',
  Figure 1\., 'Lipid damage indices of salmon oil, and canned bright  and dark  Alaska
    pink salmon with different levels  of salmon oil added to cans.', 'Free fatty
    acid values,  Peroxide-values,  2-thiobarbituric acid  values.', There were significant
    differences  in the extent of lipid hydrolysis among canned bright and dark Alaska
    pink salmon., 'The FFA values were similar to the range of 0.3-0.8%, previously
    reported for canned farmed coho salmon by Rodriguez et al..', These values were
    lower than the 6-9% reported by Aubourg and Medina  for canned tuna., 'Elevated
    FFA in the blood induces oxidative stress and promotes proinflammatory effect  leading
    to various organ defects, which precede type-2 diabetes  and nonalcoholic fatty
    liver disease.', Lipid oxidation was measured by evaluation of primary  and secondary  oxidation
    compounds., There were significant differences  in PV among bright and dark canned
    pink salmon samples and were higher than 1.4-1.9 meq/kg determined for canned
    farmed coho salmon., 'Although the PV values in this study were high, these were
    within the recommended level of 3-20 meq/kg in food-grade fish oil.', 'Despite
    significant differences observed  in TBA values among the canned bright and dark
    pink salmon samples, all values were low.', Lipid oxidation products impart unpleasant
    taste and smell to the oils and exert cytotoxic and genotoxic effects., 'Ingestion
    of these compounds may cause low-density lipoprotein cytotoxicity, atherogenesis
    and atherosclerosis, and liver enlargement indicating nutrition-induced toxicity.',
  Canned samples with different levels of added SO did not show patterns in lipid
    damage indices., Minimal oxygen availability can limit the propagation of lipid
    oxidation in muscle tissues., 'As canning was done under vacuum, severe oxidation
    in the samples is unlikely to occur.', 'However, low water activity  of the samples
    due to freeze-drying may have affected the PV values, since lipid oxidation has
    been correlated to aW.', 'The aW at the monolayer phase in foodstuff is considered
    protective from oxidation, while below or above the monolayer phase the rate of
    oxidation increases.', 'In this study, the aW of the canned samples were lower
    than the most stable condition determined for freeze-dried sockeye salmon, which
    was slightly above aW of 0.19 for the monolayer phase.', 'Moreover, Aubourg and
    Medina  reported that lipid degradation products in canned fish can either be
    partially destroyed by the heat treatment or interact with other constituents,
    such that an accurate method for their assessment is not always warranted.', Results
    in Table 4 showed that few significant differences  were observed in the sensory
    attributes evaluated when canned bright pink salmon were compared against each
    other., 'Sensory comparison among canned dark pink salmon  showed D4 to be significantly
    fattier  than D0 and D2, fishier than D0, and softer than D2.', 'Comparison between
    canned bright and dark pink salmon  showed canned bright pink salmon to be significantly
    preferred  in terms of color and overall taste, when compared with canned dark
    pink salmon.', 'In contrast, canned dark pink salmon was found to be significantly
    more bitter, fattier, fishier, and softer  than canned bright pink salmon.', 'The
    sensory tests revealed that participants favored canned salmon produced with bright
    fish, that is, fish that was not skin-watermarked.', 'This finding is in line
    with observations regarding lower quality of late-run chum salmon muscle, which
    has softer texture, a gray-white color, and developed late-odor notes when canned.',
  'Overall, sensory test results indicate that panelists did not object to addition
    of SO to canned bright or dark pink salmon.', Principal variations were observed
    in the moisture and lipid contents of canned pink salmon products studied., Compositional
    analysis revealed highest lipid content in sample B2  and lowest lipid content
    in sample D0., 'Lipid content of samples B0, B1, D2, and D4 were not significantly
    different  ranging from 5.7% to 6.8%.', 'Hence, addition of SO to canned pink
    salmon allowed for consistent lipid content between bright and dark fish.', 'Content
    of the nutritionally important components in the lipids of canned bright and dark
    pink salmon, EPA and DHA, were also standardized by addition of SO to product.',
  'Addition of 1 or 2% SO to canned bright pink salmon was not detrimental to the
    sensorial properties of the product, based on the eight sensory attributes evaluated.',
  'Although B0 and B1 were not significantly different in most of the important components,
    addition of 1% SO would be an assurance that nutritional claims regarding n-3
    fatty acids, and EPA and DHA contents are consistent; thus, counterbalancing the
    ample natural variation found in the lipid content of both, bright and dark pink
    salmon.', 'It is recommended that canned bright pink salmon be supplemented with
    at least 1% SO, while supplementation with 2% SO would be ideal for it guarantees
    a minimum quantity of 1.9 g of n-3 fatty acids per 100 g of product.', 'Addition
    of 4% SO to canned dark pink salmon was detrimental to product texture and taste,
    while supplementation with 2% SO did not negatively affect sensorial properties
    of the product, based on the eight sensory attributes evaluated.', 'Consequently,
    canned dark pink salmon should be supplemented with 2% SO for it yields consistent
    lipid content and assures minimum n-3 fatty acids content of 1.5 g per 100 g of
    product.', 'USDA-CSREES Special Project Grant #332677-62003 funded this research
