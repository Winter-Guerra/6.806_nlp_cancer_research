text: [Pomegranate is a widely used plant having medicinal properties., 'In this review,
    we have mainly focused on the already published data from our laboratory pertaining
    to the effect of methanol extract of pericarp of pomegranate  and have compared
    it with other relevant literatures on Punica.', 'Earlier, we had shown its antiproliferative
    effect using human breast, and endometrial, cervical, and ovarian  cancer cell
    lines, and normal breast fibroblasts  at concentration of 20320 g/mL.', The expressions
    of selected estrogen responsive genes  were downregulated by PME., 'Unlike estradiol,
    PME did not increase the uterine weight and proliferation in bilaterally ovariectomized
    Swiss-Albino mice models and its cardioprotective effects were comparable to that
    of 17-estradiol.', 'We had further assessed the protective role of PME on skeletal
    system, using MC3T3-E1 cells.', 'The results indicated that PME  significantly
    increased ALP  activity, supporting its suggested role in modulating osteoblastic
    cell differentiation.', The antiosteoporotic potential of PME was also evaluated
    in ovariectomized  rodent model., The results from our studies and from various
    other studies support the fact that pomegranate fruit is indeed a source of biologically
    active compounds., Punica granatum L.  is a nutrient dense fruit rich in phytochemical
    compounds., 'Plants produce low molecular weight compounds which are broadly called
    phytochemicals, usually as a mechanism of defence.', 'Some plants contain distinct
    families of phytocompounds, which are structurally similar to steroid hormone,
    17-estradiol  and compete with the endogenous hormone for binding to estrogen
    receptor, thus reducing the hormonal effect of endogenous estrogens.', These compounds
    are termed as phytoestrogens., 'Most of these phytoestrogens present in the diet
    are inactive compounds, which, on consumption, go through series of enzymatic
    changes in the gastrointestinal tract, resulting in the formation of compounds
    having structure similar to that of estrogens.', 'Phytoestrogens have captured
    major research and clinical attention due to its effectiveness in the prevention
    and treatment of perimenopausal and menopausal symptoms, over hormone replacement
    therapy.', 'They may act both as agonists and/or antagonists in a site-specific
    manner, similar to the hormonal action of selective estrogen receptor modulators.',
  It can also function as antioxidants and protect DNA from oxidant-induced damage.,
  Research on pomegranate is gaining momentum due to its tremendous nutritional values
    and medicinal uses., The current review focuses on the use of pomegranate as a
    phytoestrogen rich and nutraceutical fruit with emphasis to the work done in our
    laboratory using methanolic extract of pericarp of pomegranate., 'The chemical
    composition of the fruits differs depending on the cultivar, growing region, maturity,
    cultivation practice, climate, and storage circumstances.', 'About 50% of the
    total fruit weight corresponds to the peel, which is an important source of bioactive
    compounds such as phenolics, flavonoids, ellagitannins, and proanthocyanidin compounds,
    minerals, mainly potassium, nitrogen, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, and sodium,
    and complex polysaccharides.', The edible part of the pomegranate fruit  consists
    of 40% arils and 10% seeds., 'Arils contain 85% water, 10% total sugars, mainly
    fructose and glucose, and 1.5% pectin, organic acid, such as ascorbic acid, citric
    acid, and malic acid, and bioactive compounds such as phenolics and flavonoids,
    principally anthocyanins.', 'The seed cover of the fruit contains delphinidin-3-glucoside,
    cyanidin-3-glucoside, delphinidin-3,5-diglucoside, cyanidin-3,5-diglucoside, pelargonidin-3,5-diglucoside,
    and pelargonidin-3-glucoside with delphinidin-3,5-diglucoside being the main anthocyanin
    in pomegranate juice.', 1220% of total seed weight of pomegranate comprises seed
    oil and is self-possessed with more than 70% of the conjugated linolenic acids.,
  'The fatty acid component of pomegranate seed oil comprises over 95% of the oil,
    of which 99% is triacylglycerols.', 'Minor components of the oil include sterols,
    steroids, and a key component of mammalian myelin sheaths, cerebroside.', 'Interestingly,
    punicic acid, which is a conjugated isomer unique to pomegranate oil, constitutes
    7076% of the seed oil.', 'Phenolic compounds, together with flavonoids, anthocyanins,
    and tannins, are the main group of antioxidant phytochemicals that are important
    due to their biological and free radical scavenging activities.', 'Phenolic acids,
    flavonoids, and tannins are present in different parts of pomegranate fruit and
    this may be one of the reasons why many of the studies demonstrated that combinations
    of pomegranate extracts from different parts of the fruit were more effective
    than a single extract.', 'In a comparative analysis, anthocyanins from pomegranate
    fruit were found to possess higher antioxidant activity than vitamin-E, -carotene,
    and ascorbic acid.', Table 1 represents the key constituents of pomegranate fruit
    and tree., 'Table 1: Principal constituents of different parts of pomegranate
    tree and fruit.', 'The different parts of pomegranate plant like peel, root, bark,
    flower, leaves, and so forth exhibit different phytochemicals.', 'Extracts of
    all parts of the pomegranate fruit exhibit therapeutic properties  and target
    a range of diseases including cancer, cardiovascular disorders, diabetes, male
    infertility, Alzheimers disease, aging, and AIDS.', 'Although pomegranates extensive
    therapeutic benefits may be attributed to a number of mechanisms, most researchers
    have determined its antioxidant, anticarcinogenic, and anti-inflammatory properties.',
  Various therapeutic applications of Punica granatum are discussed here., 'Figure
    1: Therapeutically beneficial uses of Punica fruit.', 'Pomegranate fruit has been
    proven to act against various diseases like cancer, cardiovascular disorders,
    diabetes, AIDS, and Alzheimers disease.', 'Research on breast cancer cell lines
    demonstrated that pomegranate constituents efficiently inhibited angiogenesis,
    invasiveness, growth, and induced apoptosis.', 'Its anti-invasive, antiproliferative,
    and antimetastatic effects were attributed to the modulation of Bcl-2 proteins,
    upregulation of p27 and p21, and downregulation of cyclin-cdk network.', 'Pomegranate
    constituents inhibit angiogenesis via downregulation of vascular endothelial growth
    factor  in human umbilical vein endothelial and MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines,
    thereby hampering the tumor growth.', 'Prostate cancer cells, when treated with
    pomegranate juice, increased adhesion and decreased the migration.', Molecular
    analyses revealed that pomegranate juice increased the expression of cell-adhesion
    related genes and inhibited the expression of genes involved in cytoskeletal function
    and cellular migration., 'It would possibly affect prostate cancer because of
    its apoptotic, antioxidant, antiproliferative, and anti-inflammatory properties,
    suggesting that it may be beneficial in slowing down or preventing cancer cell
    metastasis.', The application of pomegranate extract to the skin of mice before
    they were exposed to a carcinogenic agent was shown to inhibit the appearance
    of erythemas and hyperplasia and the activity of epithelial ornithine decarboxylase.,
  An in vivo study in TRAMP mice model suggested that oral supplementation of pomegranate
    fruit extract inhibited metastasis and increased overall survival., Matrix metalloproteinases  are
    good markers of tumor cell invasion and migration., Phytochemicals have been shown
    to target the activity and secretion of MMPs in estrogen responsive cancers.,
  'Constituents of pomegranate minimize tumor cell invasion into normal tissue and
    metastasis to distant sites and these actions develop due to the inhibition of
    selected metalloproteinase activity, decreased focal adhesion kinase activity,
    and reduced VEGF expression.', 'With semiquantitative RT-PCR, we had found out
    that PME downregulated the transcription of MMP-9 suggesting its possible role
    in the inhibition of tumor invasion  whereas E2  did not significantly affect
    the transcription of MMP-9  which correlated with earlier studies suggesting that
    estrogen stimulated MMP-9 secretion without increasing its gene transcription.',
  'Figure 2: Effect of PME on MMP-9 transcription in MCF7 cells.', MCF7 cells were
    incubated with PME  and E2  for 24 hrs and semiquantitative RT-PCR was done.,
  shows the ratio of density of MMP-9 gene expression to that of endogenous control
    GAPDH and it represents mean  SE of 3 replicates., We had assessed the estrogenicity/antiestrogenicity
    of PME in a panel of in vitro biological assays and the expression of endogenous
    estrogen sensitive markers  in breast carcinoma cell lines were analyzed., 'When
    MCF-7 cells pretreated with PME were treated with estrogen, the c-Myc expression
    was not induced as much as when treated with estrogen alone, demonstrating the
    effect of PME in estrogen regulated mechanism.', 'ER positive cells treated with
    PPT -pyrazole-1,3,5-triyl)trisphenol)  and DPN   clearly showed that PPT increased
    the pS2 protein levels, whereas DPN did not produce any significant effect.',
  'When given in combination with PPT, PME reduced the pS2 protein levels indicating
    the role of ER in mediating the effects of PME on pS2 expression.', Thus the effect
    of PME on expression of pS2 was mediated by ER and not by ER., 'Figure 3: Effect
    of PME pretreatment on E2 induced expression of c-Myc.', 'MCF7 cells were pretreated
    with 100 nM E2 for 4 hrs, with or without PME pretreatment  for 12 hrs and RT-PCR
    was done.', shows the ratio of density of c-Myc gene expression to that of endogenous
    control GAPDH and it represents mean  SE of 3 replicates., 'Figure 4: Effect of
    PME on pS2 protein expression in MCF7 cells.', 'Immunoblot result of MCF7 cells
    treated with 10 nM E2, PME, 10 nM PPT, 10 nM DPN, and PME  with 10 nM PPT or 10
    nM DPN for 48 hrs.', Data are presented as densitometric ratio relative to nontreated
    control  cells., The values are mean  SE of 3 separate experiments., Pomegranate
    fruit extract was revealed to inhibit UV-B-mediated phosphorylation of mitogen-activated
    protein kinase  and nuclear factor NF-B activation., Pomegranate juice almost
    downregulated the TNF induced Akt  activation required for NF-B activity., Koyama
    et al., examined the effects of pomegranate extract  on the IGF system and found
    out cell growth inhibition and apoptosis., 'Their findings suggested that POMx
    treatment reduced mTOR phosphorylation at Ser2448 and Ser2481, whereas IGFBP-3
    increased phosphorylation at those sites.', These results suggested that POMx
    decreased prostate cancer cell survival by inhibiting IGF1 expression., 'To conclude,
    pomegranate fruit has anticancer properties that can be attributed to different
    mechanisms.', 'In vitro, in vivo and human trials had examined the effects of
    a range of pomegranate constituents on the prevention and reduction of atherosclerosis
    and LDL oxidation.', Evidence suggested that polyphenolic antioxidants contained
    in pomegranate juice can cause reduction of oxidative stress and atherogenesis
    through the activation of redox-sensitive genes ELK-1 and p-JUN and increased
    eNOS expression., Their results indicated that proatherogenic effects induced
    by disturbed shear stress can be reversed by constant administration of pomegranate
    juice., 'Pomegranate juice consumption for 3 years by patients with carotid artery
    stenosis reduced common blood pressure, LDL oxidation, and carotid intima-media
    thickness.', Azadzoi et al., 'demonstrated that 8-week administration of pomegranate
    juice concentrate daily in a rabbit model of arteriogenic erectile dysfunction
    significantly increased intracavernous blood flow and smooth muscle relaxation,
    probably via its antioxidant effect on enhanced nitric oxide preservation and
    bioavailability.', 'A pilot study in type 2 diabetic patients with hyperlipidemia
    found that concentrated pomegranate juice decreased cholesterol absorption, increased
    faecal excretion of cholesterol, had a favourable effect on enzymes concerned
    in cholesterol metabolism, drastically reduced LDL cholesterol, and improved LDL/HDL
    cholesterol and total/HDL ratios.', Aviram et al., 'analyzed atherosclerotic lesion
    size, antioxidant activity, blood sugar, peritoneal macrophages, oxidative status,
    and lipid profiles for 3 months after giving 6 different pomegranate preparations
    with varying amounts of total polyphenols and gallic acid content in atherosclerotic
    apolipoprotein-E deficient mice and found that pomegranate phenolics and pomegranate
    unique complexed sugars could mimic the antiatherogenic effects of pomegranate
    extracts.', All these evidences suggest the potential cardioprotective effect
    of pomegranate fruit., Tissue selective estrogen agonist/antagonists are currently
    being investigated as alternatives to estrogen in the prevention and treatment
    of postmenopausal osteoporosis., Bone loss after ovariectomy is associated with
    high bone turnover where bone resorption rate exceeds the bone formation rate.,
  'To assess the protective role of Punica on skeletal system, we had examined the
    effect of PME on a well-characterized osteoblastic cell population  and examined
    its effect on Alkaline Phosphatase, which is a commonly used bone remodelling
    marker.', 'The results  indicated that PME significantly increased ALP activity,
    supporting its suggested role in modulating osteoblastic cell differentiation.',
  'Figure 5: PME increased ALP activity in MC3T3-E1 osteoblast without affecting cell
    proliferation.', Dose-dependent effect of PME on cell proliferation., 'MC3T3-E1
    osteoblasts were treated with 0, 20, 40, 80, 160, and 320 g/mL of PME for 48 hrs
    and the cell proliferation was determined by MTT assay.', The cell proliferation
    was expressed as percentage cell viability over the untreated control., 'Cells
    were treated with E2, PME, ICI  with or without PME  for 48 hrs.', ALP activity
    was then measured and results are expressed as percentage over the untreated control.,
  Results are expressed as mean values  SE of five replicates., when compared to untreated
    control., Ovariectomized rodent model is a well-established system for estrogen
    deficiency induced bone loss and used by researchers previously., We had evaluated
    the antiosteoporotic potential of the extract in estrogen deficiency induced osteoporosis
    in young adult mice of 68 weeks of age by assessing the bone turnover by serum
    ALP., 'In comparison to the sham surgery  control, ovariectomized  control animals
    showed an increase in ALP activity indicating an increase in bone turn-over rate
    in these animals.', 'PME in higher concentration was found to be effective in
    decreasing this bone turnover, though E2 was better in controlling the accelerated
    bone turnover.', The experimental model differed from aged Ovx mice wherein the
    osteoporosis is induced only by estrogen deficiency and not by a combination of
    natural bone loss due to age and ovarian hormone deficiency., An increase in bone
    turn-over rate was indicated by higher serum ALP level in the Ovx group compared
    to the SS control group., 'Therefore, high rate of bone turnover was well corrected
    by PME suggesting that it might play a protective role against ovarian hormone
    insufficiency related bone resorption.', But E2 as well as PME was able to significantly
    decrease ALP levels in Ovx mice., 'Serum calcium and phosphorous levels in Ovx
    control, PME treated, and tamoxifen treated animals were similar to that of SS
    control animals.', Significant decrease in calcium levels was observed in E2 treated
    animals in comparison to SS control., Our findings clearly indicated that the
    possible bone preserving effect of PME is almost comparable with E2., Earlier
    studies had shown that an acute or chronic exposure to xenoestrogens or dietary
    phytoestrogens alters uterine expression of estrogen sensitive genes in mice.,
  'So in order to check whether PME has any effect, a semiquantitative RT-PCR was
    done to analyze uterine mRNA levels of lactoferrin in ovariectomized mice fed
    with PME for 7 days.', Lactoferrin is a well-known estrogen target gene and a
    biologically active molecule for bone regeneration., The positive control E2 increased
    the uterine accumulation of lactoferrin mRNA in Ovx animals compared to the vehicle
    treated Ovx control., 'Lactoferrin expression did not differ significantly between
    the groups that received PME  and the vehicle  treated Ovx control group, indicating
    the lack of estrogenicity of PME on uterine endometrium in the doses tested in
    our study.', 'Tamoxifen  was found to increase the expression of lactoferrin,
    though not significantly.', 'As there are promising results from both in vitro
    and in vivo studies, we suggest evaluating the antiosteoporotic potential by clinical
    trials with pomegranate fruit extract that has no side effects on uterine endometrium
    alongside a significant decrease in bone turn-over rate.', 'Table 2: Effect of
    E2, PME, and tamoxifen on chosen markers of bone metabolism of ovariectomized
    mice.', 'Serum calcium, phosphorus, and Alkaline Phosphatase  levels of sham control  and
    Ovx mice exposed to 0.1% ethanol, E2, PME, and tamoxifen  for 7 days.', Data are
    expressed as mean  SE., 'Figure 6: PME did not alter lactoferrin expression in
    murine uterus.', 'RT-PCR detection of Lactoferrin m-RNA in sham control  and ovariectomized
    mice exposed to 0.1% ethanol, E2, PME, and tamoxifen  for 7 days.', shows the
    ratio of density of target gene expression to that of endogenous control beta-actin
    and it represents mean  SE of three replicates., In vitro assay showed that fermented
    pomegranate juice extract is better than red wine and comparable to green tea.,
  There were also reports that pomegranate juice possessed considerably greater antioxidant
    capacity at much lower concentrations  than either grape or blueberry juice.,
  'Punica granatum peel extract decreased lipid peroxidation in hepatic, cardiac,
    and renal tissues and at the same time it had a facilitatory effect on the scavenging
    capability of superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide.', 'Formerly, it was shown
    that pomegranate peel extract supplementation alleviated oxidative damage of the
    liver and enhanced the hepatic structure and function in rats exposed to bile
    duct ligation.', 'Pretreatment of carbon tetrachloride-induced liver damage in
    rats with pomegranate peel extract resulted in the reduction of lipid peroxidation
    and at the same time, the free-radical scavenging activity of catalase, superoxide
    dismutase, and peroxidase were considerably enhanced.', Many studies had keenly
    explored the anti-inflammatory properties of pomegranate fruit., Studies indicated
    that pomegranate extract inhibited PMACI-induced proinflammatory cytokines assembly
    by inhibiting the gene expression., This is achieved by blocking JNK and ERK-MAPK
    activation and NF-B activation in human KU812 cells., Larrosa et al., showed that
    pomegranate extract supplementations led to reduced prostaglandin E2  levels in
    the colon mucosa by downregulating the overexpressed COX-2 and prostaglandin E
    synthase  levels owing to the action of ellagic acid., 'Punica granatum extract
    had been found to be particularly effective for controlling oral inflammation,
    dental plaque, and bacterial and fungal counts in periodontal disease and Candida-associated
    denture stomatitis.', Another study proposed that inhibition of number of signal
    transduction pathways and the downstream pathogenic cellular response by pomegranate
    extract or compounds may be a useful approach for the prevention of the onset
    and severity of inflammatory arthritis., The dynamism of pomegranate fruit in
    newer areas of pharmacological effects might be delivered in the future., 'Due
    to the possible adverse side effects of estrogenic stimulation, many women have
    turned to phytoestrogens as an alternative for HRT.', 'The features that facilitate
    the chemicals to bind with ER are the steric and hydrophobic properties of a compound,
    as well as the hydrogen bonding between the phenolic hydroxyl group and the ER
    binding site.', Phytoestrogens bind to both forms of ER and showed a lower binding
    affinity than E2., Some of them exhibit a higher binding affinity to ER than to
    ER which may indicate that they have different pathways for their actions and
    explains tissue specific changeability in phytoestrogenic action., Both genomic
    and nongenomic mechanisms have been projected to explain phytoestrogenic effects
    on human health., The best move towards the avoidance and handling of estrogen-dependent
    breast cancer is to selectively hold estrogen activity in the affected tissues
    without compromising its beneficial effects., 'Regrettably, at this time, available
    antiestrogen such as tamoxifen used in the treatment of ER-positive breast cancer
    has side effects and agonism in the uterine endometrium, leading to an uncertain
    connection to endometrial carcinoma.', A competitive radioactive binding study
    was done to ascertain whether PME interacts with ER and had shown that PME binds
    to ER and inhibited the binding of labelled estrogen to ER in a dose-dependent
    manner., 'According to De Felice, who coined the term nutraceutical, it can be
    defined as, a food  that provides medical or health benefits, including the prevention
    and/or treatment of a disease.', 'It may range from isolated nutrients, herbal
    products, dietary supplements, and diets to genetically engineered designer foods
    and processed products such as cereals, soups, and beverages.', 'Anthocyanidins  and
    hydrolysable tannins, account for the major antioxidant activity of whole fruit.',
  'The peel, which is also a major part of the fruit, is an imperative source of bioactive
    compounds such as phenolics, flavonoids, ellagitannins, proanthocyanidin compounds,
    minerals,, and complex polysaccharides.', 'Aviram and others reported that systolic
    blood pressure was reduced, after 1 year of pomegranate juice consumption.', This
    was believed to be related to the potent antioxidant properties of pomegranate
    polyphenols., Hong et al., 'confirmed that pomegranate juice and pomegranate extracts
    were more potent inhibitors of cell growth than isolated individual polyphenols
    in cell lines, influential synergistic and/or additive effects of several phytochemicals
    including proanthocyanidins, anthocyanins, and flavonoid glycosides.', 'Pomegranate
    contains agents, particularly polyphenolic flavonoids, which exert actions that
    could be well conducive to good oral health, particularly in relation to gingivitis
    development.', 'Pomegranate juice had the greatest antioxidant potency composite
    index among beverages like black cherry juice, cranberry juice, grape juice, apple
    juice, orange juice, red wines, blueberry juice, and iced tea; and the antioxidant
    activity was at least 20% superior to any of the other beverages tested.', 'Each
    and every part of pomegranate provides health benefits, that is, a nutraceutical
    food.', The discovery that plants generate hormonally active phytochemicals has
    altered our understanding of the connection between diet and human health., 'It
    is well established that fruit or plant extracts are a complex mixture of various
    constituents and, in most of the instances, it is not clear whether a single compound
    or a mixture of compounds is responsible for the reported effects.', 'The thought
    of the whole herb or multiherb preparation not only addresses multiple targets,
    but possibly will alleviate the toxicity and side effects of a single, isolated
    compound from the plant.', Many in vitro and in vivo studies pointed out high
    nutritional and potential tissue specific action of extract of Punica granatum.,
  Proofs are accumulating that compounds present in a fruit or herb extract augment
    each others biological effect., 'For example, it has been reported that quercetin
    and ellagic acid  together make use of a more prominent inhibitory effect against
    cancer cell growth than either compound alone.', 'We had found that PME has antiestrogenic
    effect in the mammary gland, without compromising the beneficial effects of estrogen
    in the cardiovascular and skeletal system and had no estrogenicity in the uterus.',
  PME could possibly be considered as an ideal SERM and further studies might demonstrate
    its suitability and possible application in estrogen dependent breast cancers
    with beneficial effects in other hormone dependent tissues., 'Figure 7 describes
    the biological effects of PME, as observed in our studies.', 'Furthermore, it
    would be valuable to investigate the long-term effects of PME in the in vivo models
    of estrogen deprivation to demonstrate its suitability in HRT.', 'To achieve this
    goal, a better understanding is needed regarding the orchestrated action of SERM,
    receptor and coregulators that contribute to distinct patterns of gene expression.',
  'Although scientific research is being carried out to study the biological activity
    of a lot of food phytochemicals, the health claims attributed to the final marketed
    nutraceutical products have normally little or doubtful scientific foundation.',
  'This is owing to the fact that a great deal of scientific conclusion is derived
    from animal testing and in vitro assays, while human clinical trials are limited.',
  'Some key issues such as metabolism, bioavailability, toxicity, and dose/response
    of these food bioactive compounds or nutraceuticals themselves have not been well
    recognized yet.', 'Currently, numerous clinical trials are in progress exploring
    the therapeutic potential of pomegranate extracts.', Its potential use as a nutraceutical
    needs to be investigated., We may thus anticipate that many of the open issues
    about the biological effect of extract of Punica granatum will be answered in
    the near future., 'Figure 7: Biological effects of PME.', 'PME was found to be
    antiestrogenic in breast, exhibited cardioprotective and osteoprotective effects,
    and had no estrogenicity in uterus.', It did not induce DNA adduct formation or
    oxidative DNA damage and suppressed TNF -mediated endothelial cell apoptosis.,
