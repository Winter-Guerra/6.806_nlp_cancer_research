text: [We evaluate the sedative and hypnotic activities of the methanolic and aqueous
    extract of Lavandula officinalis L. on central nervous system., 'In this study,
    the effect of the methanolic and aqueous extracts of this plant was investigated
    in a battery of behavioural models in mice.', 'Stems and flowers of Lavandula
    officinalis L. have several therapeutic applications in folk medicine in curing
    or managing a wide range of diseases, including insomnia.', 'The methanolic extract
    produced significant sedative effect at the doses of 200, 400, and 600 mg/kg,
    compared to reference substance diazepam, and an hypnotic effect at the doses
    of 800 and 1000 mg/kg while the treatment of mice with the aqueous extract at
    the doses of 200 and 400 mg/kg via oral pathway significantly reduced in both
    the reestablishment time and number of head dips during the traction and hole-board
    tests.', 'In conclusion, these results suggest that the methanolic and aqueous
    extracts of Lavandula officinalis possess potent sedative and hypnotic activities,
    which supported its therapeutic use for insomnia.', Morocco is fortunate to have
    such varied climate that almost any medicinal plant can grow., 'The varied climate
    and heterogeneous ecologic condition in Morocco have favoured the proliferation
    of more than 42,000 species of plants, divided into 150 families and 940 genuses.',
  Insomnia defined as persistent difficulty in falling or staying a sleep that affects
    function can induce significant psychological and physical disorder., 'Sedatives
    are drugs that decrease activity and have a calming, relaxing effect.', 'At higher
    doses, sedatives usually cause sleep.', Drugs used mainly to cause sleep are called
    hypnotics., 'The difference between sedatives and hypnotics, then, is usually
    the amount of the dose; lower doses have a calming effect and higher doses cause
    sleep.', Recent studies have shown that herbal drugs exert good sedative and hypnotic
    effect on the central nervous system., 'In recent years, Lavandula officinalis
    flowers exhibit such various biological and pharmacological activities as anti-tumour,
    anti-inflammatory, antihistaminic, antidiabetic, and antimicrobial activity and
    modulating the central nervous system.', 'The aim of this experiment is to evaluate
    the sedative and hypnotic activities of Lavandula officinalis methanolic and aqueous
    extract, and to, therefore, determine the scientific basis for its use in traditional
    medicine in the management of central nervous system disorders.', 'Stems and flowers
    of Lavandula officinalis L. were collected based on ethnopharmacological information
    from the villages around the region Rabat-Sale-Zemour-Zaers, with the agreement
    from the authorities and respecting the United Nations Convention of Biodiversity
    and with assistance of traditional medical practitioner.', The plant was identified
    with botanist of scientific institute., A voucher specimen  was deposited in the
    Herbarium of Botany Department of the Scientific Institute of Rabat., Stems and
    flowers of Lavandula officinalis were successively extracted with methanol by
    maceration at room temperature  over period of 48 hours., 500 g of plant material
    and one litre of methanol were used in the extraction., Methanol containing the
    extract was then filtered through Whatman paper and the solvent was vacuum distilled
    at 65C in a rotary evaporator., The remaining extract was finally dried in the
    oven at 30C for two hours to ensure the removal of any residual solvent., Final
    extract was a dark green powder in percentage dry weight 21.8%., 'For the aqueous
    extract, 500 g of plant material was extracted by infusion boiled water  for three
    days.', The respective aqueous extracts were separated from its residues by gravity
    filtration., The final crude extract was obtained as yellow greasy powder in percentage
    from dry weight., These extracts were kept in deep freeze at 20C until use., Male
    Swiss mice   were used in pharmacological tests and females of the same strain
    in the LD50 calculation., The animals were fed ad libitum with standard food and
    water except when fasting was required in the course of the study., 'The animals
    were acquired from the animal experimental centre of Mohammed V Souissi University,
    Medicine and Pharmacy Faculty, Rabat.', Median lethal dose  values were determined
    as described by Litchfield and Wilcoxon., Seven groups of mice of both sexes  received
    or not single oral doses at different concentrations., The control group received
    only the water or saline solution., 'After a single dose administration, mice
    were placed in individual clear plastic boxes and continuously observed for 6
    h and at 24 h time interval to detect any eventual side effects.', 'The number
    of animals, which died during this period, was expressed as percentile.', The
    LD50 of the extract were estimated by the p.o., route using the procedure reported
    by Litchfield and Wilcoxon; the method estimated the dose of the extract that
    would kill 50% of a reduced sample of animals by a given route., 'In a first phase,
    the extract was given to ten mice per group at doses of 500 and 1000 mg/kg; when
    no mortality was observed, the doses were increased to 1500, 2000, 3000, and 5000
    mg/kg.', 'Mice were kept under observation for 14 days to register possible mortality,
    their weights were registered, and at the end of the study they were sacrificed
    for macroscopic tissue examination, and the LD50 was determined by probit test
    using death percent versus doses log.', 'Of note, drugs used as control were given
    to mice in similar conditions.', All drugs and extracts were freshly prepared
    on the day of the experiments., A control group received distilled water  as vehicle.,
  Diazepam  and thiopental  were used as positive control., 'The activity of methanolic
    and aqueous extract from Lavandula officinalis on the central nervous system was
    then studied, using a battery of behavioral tests used in psychopharmacology.',
  We analyzed the effect of different doses of the methanolic extracts  and aqueous
    extracts  from Lavandula officinalis for their sedative and hypnotic activities.,
  'For testing sedative effect, the effect of extract on mice was qualified in one
    of the following tests.', Mice were individually suspended by anterior limbs to
    a wire stretched horizontally., Abnormal mice that fail to make a reestablishment
    at least one of its posterior limbs to reach the wire are considered as subject
    under a sedative action., 'When the animals perform normal reestablishment immediately,
    the reaction is known as positive; other wise, the reaction is called negative;
    also, the behaviours of animals were recorded during the period of the experiment.',
  The apparatus used for this test consist of a vertical glass tube 30 cm in length.,
  'Mice were individually placed vertically in the glass test tube, a normal mouse
    typically attempts to escape in thirty seconds, and the mice considered as subject
    to the sedative effect when performing the rise of cylinder greater than 30 sec.',
  'Mice were individually placed in the centre of a perforated board, and the number
    of head dips was registered during a 5 min.', 'The perforated board test was made
    by using a wood floor board, 40 cm  40 cm  25 cm, in which evenly spaced holes
    were made.', The number of explored holes provide a measure of the number of head
    dips., Thiopental  60 mg/kg was injected i.p., 30 min after administration of
    methanolic and aqueous extracts., 'The mice were treated with different doses
    of methanolic and aqueous extracts, the control group  was treated with distilled
    water, and positive control group  was administrated with diazepam, respectively.',
  The effect was recorded for disappearance  and reappearance  of the righting reflex.,
  Hypnotic sleeping time was considered to be the time interval between disappearance
    and reappearance of the righting reflex., The statistical analysis was done using
    ANOVA., The results with  were considered significant., The data are expressed
    as mean  SD., 'Following oral administration of Lavandula officinalis extract
    at the doses of 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, 3000, and 5000 mg/kg, p.o., no toxicity
    and no significant changes in the body weight between the control and treated
    group were demonstrated at these doses.', 'This result indicates that, the LD50
    was higher than 5000 mg/kg.', The results of psychotropic effects of methanolic
    and aqueous extracts were expressed by comparison with control groups., 'Pharmacological
    tests were then performed at nontoxic doses, for the methanolic extract and, for
    the aqueous extract.', The methanolic extract of Lavandula officinalis given by
    oral route at 100 mg/kg did not significantly alter the reestablishment time;
    all animals performed normal reestablishment immediately., 'However, the extract
    at the dose of 200 mg/kg produced significant sedative effect on the central nervous
    system  as indicated by the relatively high time for the reestablishment of the
    mice.', 'By increasing the doses to 400 and 600 mg/kg, the average reestablishment
    time was increased.', The reestablishment time was notably higher than control
    group., 'For the aqueous extract, after oral administration at the dose of 100
    mg/kg, all animals performed normal reestablishment time.', This indicates that
    this extract produced no significant sedative effect on mice behavior at this
    dose., 'By increasing the doses to 200 and 400 mg/kg, the reestablishment time
    was increased; the mice fail to make a reestablishment immediately.', 'So, the
    aqueous extract of Lavandula officinalis produced significant sedative effect
    at the doses of 200 and 400 mg/kg p.o..', 'In addition, the dose of 100 mg/kg
    of both extracts did not decreased the reestablishment time.', 'Table 1: Sedative
    action of Lavandula officinalis methanolic extract.', p.o., means oral route;
    i.p., 'means intraperitoneal route;  means number of mice per group; sec means
    seconds; ME: mean methanolic extract; DZP means diazepam.', Data are expressed
    as mean  SD;  versus the control group., 'Table 2: Sedative effect of aqueous
    extract of Lavandula officinalis.', p.o., means oral route; i.p., means intraperitoneal
    route;  means number of mice per group; sec means seconds; AE means aqueous extract;
    DZP means diazepam., Data are expressed as mean  SD;  versus the control group.,
  Animal treated with the methanolic extract of Lavandula officinalis at the dose
    of 100 mg/kg via oral route do not show loss of initiative and curiosity., 'By
    increasing the doses to 200, 400, and 600 mg/kg, all mice lose initiative and
    curiosity; that is, animal did not attempt to mount the tube for escape.', 'While,
    the aqueous extract, at the doses of 100 mg/kg, produced no sedative effect, at
    the doses of 200 and 400 mg/kg p.o., all animals treated showed loss of initiative
    and curiosity.', 'In the hole-board test, a significant reduction in the number
    of head dips at the doses of 200, 400, and 600 mg/kg by oral route administration;
    with the exception at the dose of 100 mg/kg, the methanolic extract did not reduce
    the number of head dips.', 'However, animal treated with the aqueous extract at
    the doses of 100 mg/kg did not reduce the number of head dips.', 'By increasing
    the doses to 200 and 400 mg/kg, this extract reduced the cumulative number of
    holes explored and the number of spaces between two holes explored.', 'The data
    lead to conclude that the methanolic and aqueous extract of Lavandula officinalis
    possess potential sedative effects on the central nervous system at the doses
    of 200, 400, and 600 mg/kg via oral route administration.', We observed that the
    lavender methanolic extract  had induced hypnotic effect significant., Hypnosis
    induced by methanolic extract  was evaluated by observation of the duration of
    thiopental-induced sleeping time., The extract showed a reduction in the time
    of onset of sleep induced by thiopental., The effects of the extract on onset
    of sleep at 800 and 1000 mg/kg were comparable to that of diazepam at 3 mg/kg.,
  The highest prolongation of sleep produced by the methanolic extract was comparable
    to that of diazepam., Only the highest dose tested for ME significantly increased
    from  to  min; the duration of hypnos is induced by thiopental., 'However, the
    aqueous extract of Lavandula officinalis at the doses of 800 and 1000 mg/kg, p.o.,
    produced no hypnotic activity significant on the central nervous system confirming,
    thus, the hypnotic action of lavender methanolic extract at high doses by oral
    pathway.', 'Table 3: Effect of the methanolic extract of Lavandula officinalis
    on the onset and duration of sleep in thiopental-treated mice.', Mice received
    thiopental  30 min after the pretreatment of methanolic extract  and diazepam.,
  i.p., means intraperitoneal route; p.o., means oral route;  means number of mice
    per group; ME means methanolic extract; D ZP means diazepam., Data are expressed
    as mean  SD;  versus the control group., 'In aromatherapy, the methanolic and
    aqueous extracts of Lavandula officinalis are believed to possess anticonvulsive,
    sedative, hypnosis, and antidepressive effects and to be useful for treating nervous
    breakdown, nervous tension, depression, and insomnia.', 'In this paper, we observed
    the sedative and hypnotic properties of methanolic and aqueous extract from Lavandula
    officinalis L. in mice.', 'Therefore, in order to study the comprehensive effect
    of our drugs, the following targets were observed: reestablishment time, number
    of head dips, and loss of initiative and curiosity in mice.', Diazepam is central
    nervous system depressant used in the management of sleep disorders such as insomnia;
    these compounds have a binding site on GABA receptor type-A ionophore complex.,
  'It decreases activity, moderates excitement, and calms the recipient.', Substances
    like diazepam  reduce onset of and increase duration of barbiturate-induced sleep
    and reduce exploratory activity possessing potentials as sedative., 'Lavender
    extract increased the time of reestablishment by mice in the traction test, after
    oral administration of 200, 400, and 600 mg/kg dosages, producing sedative effect
    similar to that observed with 3 mg/kg diazepam.', Diazepam is a very well-known
    anxiolytic benzodiazepine  which produces not only anxiolytic-like effect but
    also important sedative action., 'In this respect, lavender extract produced a
    dose-dependent reduction in the number of head dips in the hole-board test similar
    and/or greater than diazepam.', 'It is generally believed that locomotor activity
    results from brain activation, which is manifested as an excitation of central
    neurons involving different neurochemical mechanism and an increase in cerebral
    metabolism.', 'It is possible that the sedative activity of methanolic and aqueous
    extract of Lavandula officinalis is mediated by GABAergic pathway, since GABAergic
    transmission can produce profound sedation in mice.', 'The inhibitory action of
    GABA consists in the opening of chloride channels to allow hyperpolarizing the
    membrane, leading to CNS depression and resulting in sedative and hypnosis activity.',
  'Glutamate and GABA are quantitatively the most important excitatory and inhibitory
    neurotransmitters, respectively, in the mammalian brain.', 'Thus, receptors for
    these two neurotransmitters are regarded as important targets for psychotropic
    drugs.', 'In the test of thiopental-induced sleep in mice, the potentiated effect
    of lavender extract in mice was represented.', It not only prolonged the sleeping
    time but also decreased the latency of falling asleep and increases the rat of
    sleep onset., 'The lavender extract has produced hypnosis at high doses that is,
    800 and 1000 mg/kg.', 'Since the effect of thiopental on the CNS involves the
    activation of the inhibition GABAergic system, this finding suggests that some
    constituents in lavender extract produce facilitation of this inhibitory system.',
  'Phytochemical studies have identified active components in this plant such as coumarin,
    chalcones, flavanones, flavones, flavonols, quercetin, and kaempferol derivatives,
    suggesting that they are the main responsible for sedative and hypnotic activities.',
  Further chemical and pharmacological analysis of the extract will be conducted to
    isolate and characterize the active principles responsible for the sedative and
    hypnotic effect., 'In conclusion, p.o.', 'administration of methanolic and aqueous
    extract of Lavandula officinalis induces similar sedative effects, supporting
    its use in folk medicine.', 'Given that the LD50 value for these extracts was
    beyond 5000 mg/kg for oral administration, as determined by Litchfield and Wilcoxon
    ; our results suggest a remote risk of acute toxicity and good tolerance of these
    extracts in traditional medicine.', 'To sum up, this work represents that the
    methanolic and aqueous extracts of Lavandula officinalis have obvious sedative
    and hypnotic activity; these data provide pharmacological basis for its therapeutic
    efficacy on insomnia.', The authors wish to thank all the individuals and institutions
    who made this survey possible.]
