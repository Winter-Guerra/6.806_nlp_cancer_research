text: ['In recent years, increasing attention has been paid to the role of hormones
    in breast cancer etiology, following reports that heightened levels of endogenous
    hormones and exposure to exogenous hormones and other endocrine-disrupting chemicals
    through food and the environment are associated with increased breast cancer risk.',
  Seven hormone drugs  are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use
    in food animals., 'There is concern that these drugs or their biologically active
    metabolites may accumulate in edible tissues, potentially increasing the risk
    of exposure for consumers.', 'To date, the potential for human exposure to residues
    of these compounds in animal products, as well as the risks that may result from
    this exposure, is poorly understood.', 'In this paper, we discuss the existing
    scientific evidence examining the toxicological significance of exposure to hormones
    used in food animal production in relation to breast cancer risk.', 'Through a
    discussion of U.S. federal regulatory programs and the primary literature, we
    interpret the state of surveillance for residues of hormone drugs in animal products
    and discuss trends in meat consumption in relation to the potential for hormone
    exposure.', 'Given the lack of chronic bioassays of oral toxicity of the seven
    hormone compounds in the public literature and the limitations of existing residue
    surveillance programs, it is not currently possible to provide a quantitative
    characterization of risks that result from the use of hormonal drugs in food animal
    production, complicating our understanding of the role of dietary hormone exposure
    in the population burden of breast cancer.', 'California Environmental Protection

    Breast cancer is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States.',
  'The National Cancer Institute  estimated that 232,340 women would be diagnosed
    with breast cancer in 2013 and 39,620 women would die of it.', The NCI also estimated
    that the lifetime breast cancer risk of women born today is 1 in 8., 'Given the
    public health burden, extensive research on risk factors is currently underway.',
  'In recent years, increasing attention has been paid to the role of hormones in
    breast cancer etiology, following reports that heightened levels of endogenous
    hormones and exposure to exogenous hormones and other endocrine-disrupting chemicals
    through food and the environment are associated with increased breast cancer risk.',
  'In the U.S., several active ingredients of drugs approved by the Food and Drug
    Administration  for use in food animal production are endogenous hormones  or
    compounds that display a high affinity for human hormone receptors.', 'These drugs
    are approved for use in cattle and, in the case of zeranol, sheep to increase
    weight gain and improve feed efficiency.', 'E2, progesterone, and MGA are also
    approved to manage estrus in beef cattle and sheep.', 'An additional compound,
    bovine somatotropin, is approved as a method for increasing milk production in
    dairy cattle.', Hormones are not approved for use in poultry or swine., 'WG weight

    milk production, OTC over the counter, BST bovine somatotropin


    There is concern that drugs approved for use in cattle and sheep or their biologically
    active metabolites may accumulate in edible tissues, potentially exposing consumers.',
  'There is also concern that bST used in dairy cattle increases levels of another
    hormone, insulin-like growth factor 1, in milk and dairy products, likewise increasing
    consumer exposure.', 'As a result, the use of these drugs has been controversial.',
  The U.S. and European Union  governments have engaged in a decades-long trade dispute
    over importation of U.S. beef from cattle that have received them., The question
    of whether these drugs pose a human health risk remains subject to debate., The
    quantitative risk assessment process developed by a National Research Council  committee
    in 1983 and updated in 2009 is the standard approach to estimating human health
    risks posed by exposure to chemicals., A variant of this process has been adopted
    by the FDA for evaluation and approval of new animal drugs for use in food animal
    production., 'The NAS process consists of four steps: hazard identification, doseresponse
    assessment, exposure assessment, and risk characterization.', 'This report summarizes
    the information available to inform each of these steps with respect to the seven
    drugs described above, and identifies research gaps that need to be filled in
    order to more adequately elucidate any risk of breast cancer or other adverse
    outcomes posed by their use.', 'The hazard identification and doseresponse steps
    of the risk paradigm for the seven hormone drugs are combined and summarized in
    this section, encompassing details from published in vitro, in vivo, and epidemiologic
    studies.', 'The studies are grouped by hormone, and the hormones are grouped by
    their primary hormone receptor.', 'We have limited the scope of our review to
    studies in mammalian species, and given the state of the literature, a formal
    doseresponse assessment was not pursued.', 'In cattle, testosterone propionate  is
    rapidly metabolized to a form that is indistinguishable from endogenous testosterone.',
  Testosterone metabolism in cattle is not well characterized., Prospective epidemiologic
    studies have found an association between circulating levels of testosterone and
    increased breast cancer risk in postmenopausal women., 'Conversely, an inverse
    relationship between circulating levels of the testosterone precursor dehydroepiandrosterone
    and risk of breast cancer has been reported in premenopausal women.', It is believed
    that androgens antagonize estrogen-dependent cell growth in premenopausal women
    via one mechanism but stimulate cell growth in postmenopausal women via a different
    mechanism., 'In animals, testosterone has been associated with a number of adverse
    reproductive and developmental effects.', 'In female rats exposed to 1 mg TP in
    utero on gestation days  16 or 19, and then to 1 g TP on postnatal days  1 or
    5, a high percentage of animals within groups exposed on GD 19 had modified vaginas
    and sexual behavior deficits compared to both vehicle-only controls and groups
    exposed on GD 16.', 'This 1983 report supports the importance of windows of toxicity,
    in which effects are dependent upon the developmental stage of the receptor organism.',
  'In a different study, masculinized external genitalia was more common in female
    rats born of dams injected with 2 mg/day TP on GDs 1620 than in female rats born
    of vehicle-only controls, although postnatal ovarian cyclicity was normal.', 'In
    a third study, pregnant rats were injected with 0.5, 1, 2, 5, or 10 mg/day TP
    on GDs 1419.', 'The authors reported several androgenic effects in rat offspring
    at 0.5 mg/day TP, including increased anogenital distance  at weaning and in adulthood,
    as well as reduced numbers of nipples and areolas.', 'In a fourth study, the same
    group reported that rats born of dams injected subcutaneously with 1.5 or 2 mg/day
    TP on GDs 1418 had increased AGD at PND 2, reduced numbers of nipples and areola,
    and several genital malformations.', 'In cattle, trenbolone acetate  is metabolized
    to its most active form, 17-trenbolone, and then further metabolized to 17-trenbolone,
    which is also biologically active, and trendione, which is not biologically active.',
  'As the most active form of TBA, TB is the predominant focus of the toxicologic
    literature.', 'In contrast to assessments of its endocrine effects, genotoxicity
    assays of TB have produced mostly negative results, although a number of these
    tests were conducted by the industry, and some positive experiments have been
    reported as well.', TB has induced neoplastic transformations in Syrian hamster
    embryo cells in vitro in multiple experiments., 'In general, the in vivo literature
    is sparse, and no published study of carcinogenicity was identified.', 'Instead,
    studies have examined reproductive and developmental endpoints.', 'In the castrated
    rat, TB increased the combined weight of androgen-sensitive reproductive tissue
    and decreased body and adrenal gland weights relative to controls immediately
    following subcutaneous injections of 50 g/day for 10 days.', 'In a 200-g/day group,
    those effects were elevated further.', 'In another study reported simultaneously,
    TB administration by gavage, also on days 5665, increased androgen-sensitive tissue
    weight relative to controls beginning at 10 mg/kgBW/day.', 'At 50 mg/kgBW/day,
    these effects were heightened, and other, similar effects were also observed.',
  'In a two-generation rat study, the same group reported that subcutaneous TB injections
    during pregnancy  caused few effects in dams.', 'At PND 2, however, AGD increased
    in a dose-dependent manner in F1 female pups from 0.5 mg/day.', 'At PND 13, the
    total number of nipples displayed was reduced in F1 females at 2 mg/day, but the
    number of normal nipples displayed was reduced at 0.5 mg/day.', 'In a continuation
    of the same study, AGD remained elevated at PND 23 in the 2-mg/day group, with
    dose-dependent increase in AGD at 0.5 and 1 mg/day, albeit non-significantly.',
  'The total number of nipples displayed at PND 23 likewise remained significantly
    reduced at 2 mg/day; some nipples were still missing in the 1-mg/day group, but
    this was also not significant.', 'TB delayed vaginal opening  at 2 mg/day and
    induced a number of genital malformations at various doses, beginning at 0.5 mg/day.',
  'In F2 pups, survival was reduced at PNDs 1 and 6 at 1 mg/day.', 'In a separate
    study, castrated mice were injected subcutaneously with TB each day for two weeks,
    and then sensitized to a T-cell antigen, 2,4-ninitro-1-fluorobenzene.', 'At one
    week following sensitization, DNFB was applied to the right pinna of each mouse.',
  'The mice were monitored for delayed-type hypersensitivity  as indicated by pinna
    thickness, measured daily for one week.', TB reduced DTH in a dose-dependent manner
    at both doses., 'The responsible mechanism was unknown, although endogenous androgens
    are involved in immunosuppression.', 'In addition, weights of androgen-sensitive
    reproductive tissues were decreased at both doses, in contrast to increased weights
    observed in castrated rats.', No attempt was made to explain the contradictory
    result., 'The FDAs website includes two Freedom of Information Act  summaries,
    from 1986 and 1996.', 'In 1986, increased incidence of hepatic neoplasia and hyperplasia
    relative to controls was reported in male and female rats that received TBA in
    their diet at 100 parts per million  for 96 weeks  or 104 weeks.', 'From another
    study, an FDA committee concluded that increased incidence of pancreatic islet
    cell tumors observed in rats born of dams that received TBA in the diet was not
    a carcinogenic effect of trenbolone acetate, but no further detail or explanation
    was provided.', 'In 1996, carcinogenicity was not reported, but mammary gland
    atrophy was more frequent and/or severe in female rats that received TBA at 16
    ppm in their diet for 12 months than in controls.', 'From the 1986 approval, the
    FDA determined that hormonal activity was the critical effect of TBA and, from
    a study in the female rhesus monkey, identified 40 g/kgBW/day as the hormonal
    no-effect level.', 'The ADI established by the FDA is 0.4 g/kgBW/day, presumably
    due to the division of the specified no-effect level by safety factors totaling
    100, although the factors applied by the FDA are not presented in the summary.',
  'In cattle, estrogen benzoate is converted to estradiol.', 'E2 is more potent than
    two other physiologic estrogens, estrone  and estriol.', 'Following the administration
    of radiolabeled E2 to cattle, the predominant metabolite detected in urine was
    17-estradiol, as well as E1 and conjugates of E1 and E2.', 'There is clear evidence
    that estrogen is a mammary carcinogen, in part based on results from large epidemiologic
    investigations of its safety for hormone replacement therapy in menopause.', It
    is believed that estrogen can act as both an initiator and promoter in breast
    carcinogenesis., Its action as an initiator is effected by E2 metabolites that
    can bind and damage DNA directly and by other metabolites that can elicit DNA
    damage via oxidative stress., 'As a promoter, E2 binds estrogen receptors  and
    elicits both cell proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis.', 'Because the carcinogenicity
    of estrogen is better supported by current evidence, and is reviewed in detail
    elsewhere, we have limited our review of the literature in this report.', 'In
    cattle, zeranol is metabolized to several compounds, although the literature has
    focused primarily on the parent compound.', Zeranol is an ER agonist with potency
    similar to diethylstilbestrol and estradiol-17., In vitro studies provide the
    clearest evidence that zeranol is a mammary carcinogen., 'Repeated zeranol treatments
    were shown to reduce cell doubling time, stimulate colony formation, and, most
    notably, induce expression of ER- mRNA in the MCF-10A human breast epithelial
    cell line.', 'Because MCF-10A is putatively ER-negative, the authors suggest that
    induction of ER- mRNA may have been redox-mediated.', 'In ER-positive human breast
    carcinoma cells, low concentrations of zeranol were found to accelerate cell growth,
    but the same concentrations did not affect the growth of ER-negative cells.',
  'At a higher concentration, zeranol induced apoptosis of both ER-positive and ER-negative
    cells.', This report is consistent with an emerging scientific consensus on the
    importance of low-dose effects distinct from overt cytotoxicity at higher doses.,
  Another study found that zeranol increased the proliferation of cancerous human
    breast epithelial cells to a greater degree than normal cells and down-regulated
    expression of the tumor suppressor gene p53., 'Ex vivo studies of cells isolated
    from the tissues of rats and beef heifers implanted with zeranol have found that
    further exposure to zeranol in vitro increases cell proliferation, up-regulates
    oncogenes, and/or down-regulates tumor suppressor genes  relative to cells from
    tissues of untreated animals.', 'Evidence from in vivo studies is more equivocal,
    and studies to date have been hampered by small sample size, short duration, and
    the limited attention paid to carcinogenicity.', 'Sheffield and Welsch  found
    that ovariectomized mice  injected subcutaneously with zeranol from weeks 6 to
    8, and then sacrificed immediately, displayed increased mammary gland growth relative
    to controls.', 'In contrast, two studies, one in mice  and the other in rats,
    found no significant effect on mammary gland growth or carcinogenesis following
    prepubertal  exposure to zeranol by subcutaneous injection.', 'In the rat study,
    animals were injected with the carcinogen N-methyl-N-nitrosourea at 10 days following
    the last zeranol injection.', Zeranol did not significantly affect mammary carcinogenesis
    by week 37., 'In contrast, zeranol exposure has been associated with precancerous
    changes in the liver of the Armenian hamster, which is especially sensitive to
    estrogen, and in the prostate of the Akkaraman lamb.', 'In humans, progesterone
    has a number of clinical applications; it is often administered in combination
    with estrogen during hormonal therapy, and has been shown to aid in the effectiveness
    of chemotherapy drugs.', 'Progesterone therapy has been suggested to reduce the
    risk of spontaneous preterm delivery, and has been proposed as having neuroprotective
    effects when administered with estrogen.', Much of the epidemiologic evidence
    available for progesterone relates to its use in hormone replacement therapy.,
  It has been shown that HRT increases the risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal
    women., 'In a study of the specific modalities of HRT in an investigation conducted
    in the UK with a sample size exceeding 1 million women, it was observed that HRT
    with an estrogen-progesterone combination was responsible for an increase in breast
    cancer risk over and above that associated with estrogen treatment alone.', Other
    studies have shown that the addition of progestins to HRT can reduce the risk
    of endometrial cancer., 'With regard to breast cancer, one prospective study of
    plasma levels of endogenous steroid hormones did not find a significant association
    between progesterone levels and breast cancer in postmenopausal women, despite
    seeing evidence of a relationship for estrogens  and testosterone.', 'Other studies
    have examined breast cancer risk in premenopausal women; in one large study, a
    significant inverse association between progesterone levels and breast cancer
    risk was observed, whereas four smaller studies and a second large study did not
    find significant associations.', 'A study in postmenopausal mice has shown that
    hormonal therapy with estrogen and progesterone stimulates epithelial cell proliferation,
    which is believed to be a factor in the development of breast cancer.', 'Aside
    from its potential role in breast carcinogenesis, progesterone has been shown
    to have other cellular effects.', Studies in rats have demonstrated that progesterone
    treatment can increase cellular susceptibility to the effects of cadmium., 'A
    different study in the ovaries of Chinese hamsters and four different human cell
    lines  found that progesterone treatment inhibited cholesterol synthesis, resulting
    in the accumulation of cholesterol precursors, ultimately resulting in cholesterol
    auxotrophy.', 'MGA metabolism in cattle remains unclear: according to one study
    reported by employees of an MGA sponsor, the percentage of total residue accounted
    for by MGA was 29 % in the liver and kidney, 48 % in muscle, and 84 % in fat.',
  A number of metabolites were detected but not identified., 'MGA and other progestins
    have been investigated in animals as chemoprophylactic agents against hormone-sensitive
    cancers, including breast cancer.', 'In the rat, 5 g MGA/g feed for 30 days was
    associated with increased mammary lobulo-alveolar development relative to controls
    in intact animals but not ovariectomized animals.', 'In SHN virgin mice, 10 mg
    MGA implanted subcutaneously increased mammary tumorigenesis but slightly inhibited
    the formation of preneoplastic hyperplastic alveolar nodules relative to controls  implanted
    with cholesterol.', The authors suggested that heterogeneity in the hormonal response
    of clones accounted for these seemingly contradictory responses., 'In the BDII/Han
    rat, in which incidence of endometrial carcinoma  approaches 90 % in later life,
    MGA suppressed ECa in all rats receiving 250, 500, or 1,000 ppm MGA in their diet
    from days 24 to 28, while the incidence in untreated controls  was 85 %.', 'In
    addition to controlled experiments in rodents, mammary carcinogenicity has been
    reported in small observational studies of captive wild felids in which MGA was
    used as a contraceptive.', There is also evidence that prepubertal exposure to
    MGA accelerates the onset of puberty in the beef heifer., 'Reproductive toxicity
    per se was not assessed in the published literature; in the rabbit, however, oral
    administration of MGA to two dams on gestation day  14 increased MGA residues
    in fetal tissues at GD 27, indicating in utero exposure.', Insulin-like growth
    factor 1  is an endogenous protein hormone produced by the liver in response to
    somatotropin., Bovine somatotropin  is approved by the FDA for use in dairy cattle
    to increase milk production., It is injected subcutaneously., 'As acknowledged
    by the FDA and the industry, the use of bST increases IGF-1 levels in milk, although
    the magnitude of this increase has been disputed.', 'The key questions for a toxicological
    evaluation in support of risk assessment include what fraction of IGF-1 in milk
    is absorbed intact in the human gut, how this affects endogenous IGF-1 in circulation,
    and the biological significance of an increase in circulating IGF-1 levels.',
  Bovine IGF-1 in milk is identical to human IGF-1., 'Nevertheless, the FDA and industry
    maintain that milk-borne IGF-1, as a protein hormone, is digested in the gut and
    not absorbed intact.', 'For that reason, IGF-1 was approved with limited toxicity
    studies.', Both assays included groups dosed subcutaneously and groups dosed by
    gavage., 'Treatment-related effects were observed only in the subcutaneous groups,
    and it was argued that this supports the contention that IGF-1 is not orally active.',
  It could not be determined from published reports whether a change in circulating
    IGF-1 levels was assessed in either study., 'The effect of lifetime oral exposure,
    which is more relevant when the vehicle is milk, was not assessed.', The latency
    periods of clinical endpoints associated with increased circulating IGF-1 levels
    in the epidemiologic literature  is almost certainly longer than two weeks in
    the rat., The relationship between plasma and serum IGF-1 levels and breast cancer
    risk has been assessed in numerous epidemiologic studies., A 2004 meta-analysis
    of six casecontrol studies reported significant associations in premenopausal
    women  but not in postmenopausal women., 'However, a more recent meta-analysis
    of individual data from 17 prospective studies reported associations in both premenopausal
    and postmenopausal women.', Heightened IGF-1 levels have also been associated
    with increased risk of colorectal and prostate cancers., The reported associations
    between circulating IGF-1 levels and cancer risks are supported by biologically
    plausible mechanisms., Dairy consumption has been associated with higher circulating
    IGF-1 levels., 'Despite this fact, a weak association between dairy consumption
    and breast cancer risk was found in one meta-analysis, and no significant association
    was found in another.', 'Dairy consumption may not be an appropriate surrogate
    for IGF-1 exposure attributable to bST use, however, as IGF-1 and other hormones
    are present in the milk of untreated cows, and by 2008, the use of bST had fallen
    to 17.2 % of the U.S. dairy herd.', Understanding the burden posed by dietary
    hormone exposure requires data on residue levels in food animal products., 'For
    hormones administered to food animals, in order to obtain FDA approval, drug companies  are
    required to conduct feeding studies that show the rates of depletion of these
    compounds in the edible tissues of dosed food animals.', These studies are used
    to inform recommended dosages and to set withdrawal periods  that are intended
    to ensure that remaining residue concentrations have fallen to levels the FDA
    considers safe for human consumption., 'In addition, some residue data are available
    from federal food safety monitoring programs and independent research studies.',
  Available data are described below., 'As part of the NADA process, the sponsor of
    a new animal drug is required to conduct and submit studies to the FDA that characterize
    residues that may persist in animal products when the drug is used in accordance
    with the conditions of use proposed in the NADA.', The extent of study data and
    summaries that are publicly accessible is limited., 'Even for drugs where residue
    depletion summaries are accessible, confidence in any of the conclusions drawn
    is limited by problems with data design and results reporting.', 'An example can
    be found in the case of NADA 141043, for a combination implant drug containing
    TBA and estradiol benzoate.', 'In the FOIA summary associated with this approval,
    serious issues are apparent regarding study design  and reporting clarity  that
    would challenge the value of this study for determining anticipated residues.',
  'In this particular case, the study was used to support the decisions not to require
    marker residue tolerance or withdrawal periods for the drug.', Feeding studies
    conducted outside the NADA process were uncommon., Daxenberger and colleagues
    examined residues of MGA that persisted in edible tissues and plasma under FDA-approved
    conditions of use and following overdosage  in heifers post-56-day treatment.,
  'Detectable residues of MGA were observed in tissues in the following order: fat
    &gt; &gt; liver &gt; kidney &gt; muscle &gt; plasma, with increasing residue concentrations
    tracking with increases of administered dose.', The authors found that tripling
    the recommended dose resulted in fat residue concentrations that exceeded FDA
    residue tolerance levels., A compilation of studies of experimental animals implanted
    with hormones  examined tissues for residues of endogenous and exogenous hormones
    in treated and control animals., 'For the examined exogenous hormones, measurable
    concentrations  were present in all tissues examined.', 'Marked increases were
    seen in endogenous hormone  residues of implanted animal tissues, with greater
    differences seen in non-liver tissues.', 'While the literature describing various
    techniques for determining hormone residues in animal products is expansive, few
    studies were identified of residues in retail animal products, and mid- or large-scale
    evaluations of residues in retail animal products were not identified.', 'The
    focus of the majority of studies identified was on free/unconjugated hormone residues,
    as these are believed to be the most biologically active forms.', 'Concerns have
    been raised, however, that conjugated estrogens can be deconjugated in the gastrointestinal
    tract, resulting in the release of free forms of these compounds, which then may
    become available for absorption and subsequent binding to hormone receptors.',
  'To date, the largest body of literature available is for hormone residues in dairy
    products; studies of E1 and E2 levels in various milk products were most common.',
  'Studies typically analyzed small numbers of retail samples; single samples per
    product type were not uncommon, and studies rarely exceeded ten samples per product.',
  'Estrogens, particularly forms of E2, were the most frequently examined.', 'Looking
    across studies, some patterns emerge, though it is necessary to acknowledge that
    the limited number of studies and small sample sizes within those studies do not
    allow for statements of great certainty.', Free E2  concentrations in milk samples
    have been reported in ranging from less than the limit of detection  to 5.84 pg/mL.,
  'Studies of free -E2 and -E2 in milk found concentration levels ranging from below
    the LOD to 3.7 pg/mL and 0.510.7 pg/mL, respectively.', 'Generally, as the fat
    content of milk increased, free E2 concentrations were higher.', 'No differences
    in E2 concentrations were observed when comparing USDA certified organic milk
    to conventionally produced milk, though comparisons of unprocessed  milk and processed
    milk showed that the processing step can significantly reduce free E2 concentrations.',
  'Reported ranges of total  E2 spanned 20.4 to 61.52 pg/mL, with the highest concentrations
    found in samples with the most fat content.', Total levels of -E2 and -E2 did
    not appear to track well with fat content., 'A single study examined raw milk
    across the three trimesters of pregnancy, and found a clear trend in E2 levels
    increasing with trimester.', 'One study reported total E2 concentrations in butter,
    cream, and half-and-half of 15.8 and 6 pg/g, and 1.9 pg/mL, respectively.', A
    limited number of studies examined E1 levels in dairy products., 'Among processed
    milk samples, free E1 concentrations ranged from 1.1 to 14.45 pg/mL.', A single
    study reported a free E1 concentration of 28.3 pg/g in milk fat., Some variability
    was observed across studies in free E1 concentrations within the same types of
    dairy products., 'In the aforementioned study looking at raw milk across trimester
    or pregnancy, E1 concentrations were highest in late pregnancy, and the impact
    of milk processing was significant on residual free E1.', 'Studies of total E1
    reported levels ranging from 8.2 to 397.0 pg/mL in processed milk, and a peak
    value of 1,266 pg/mL in raw milk from a cow in its third trimester of pregnancy.',
  'One study examined butter, cream, and half-and-half, reporting total E1 concentrations
    of 118.9 pg/g, 54.1 pg/g, and 20.4 pg/mL, respectively.', Two French studies by
    the same group examined levels of testosterone in dairy products., 'The first,
    which measured -testosterone, reported a concentration range of 27.46 to 94.86
    ng/L.', Concentrations increased as a function of fat content of the milk., 'The
    other study reported a range for total testosterone of 2.920.4 ng/L, which was
    considerably lower than the groups earlier study.', No obvious patterns were observed
    for total testosterone with regard to fat content., 'The same two French studies
    examined residues of total -E2 and -E2, E1, and -testosterone and -testosterone
    in eggs, finding measurable levels of all compounds.', 'Concentrations ranges
    of 0.030.85 and 0.151.45 g/kg were reported for -E2 and -E2, whereas E1 was measured
    at 0.152.47 g/kg.', 'The earlier of the two studies measured levels of 1.542.62
    and 1.061.56 g/kg for -testosterone and -testosterone, respectively, and the later
    study found a range of 0.161.88 g/kg for total testosterone.', Concerns related
    to the use of rBST have focused on resulting levels of IGF-1 in milk products.,
  'While IGF-1 is present in untreated cows milk, the use of rBST has been examined
    for its propensity to increase concentrations of the drug in commercial milk.',
  The European Commission  published a report in 1999 that examined available literature
    regarding impacts of rBST treatment on IGF-1 levels., The report found evidence
    that rBST treatment resulted in milk IGF-1 concentrations two to five times greater
    than those in milk from untreated animals., 'Earlier research cited in the EC
    report had identified a range of IGF-1 concentrations in cows milk of 134 ng/mL,
    whereas later research found that milk from treated animals had an average concentration
    of 5.9 ng/mL as compared to an average of 3.7 ng/mL in untreated animals.', 'JECFA
    reported concentrations of IGF-1 in milk from treated and untreated cows in a
    range of 113 and 19 ng/mL, respectively, and noted that the levels of IGF-1 were
    influenced by stage of lactation, nutritional status, and animal age.', 'Attempts
    to find additional studies of IGF-1 levels in commercial milk were unsuccessful,
    though references in the literature of declining frequency of rBST use were found.',
  A smaller number of studies have attempted to characterize residues of synthetic
    hormones in beef products., 'One study successfully measured hormone residues
    in these products, finding fractions of ppb residues in the liver, kidney, and
    muscle tissue of cattle implanted with E2 and TBA.', 'Most other studies examined
    beef tissue for residues of zeranol, and never found concentrations above quantitation
    limits.', 'One older study that lacked a clear description of its analytical methods
    looked at beef liver, kidney, and muscle tissue for a suite of hormones  and found
    no measurable residues.', 'A Turkish study of meat and sausage products from markets
    in Istanbul  reported detection of zeranol and TBA residues in 100 % and 80 %
    of samples tested, respectively; reported concentrations were considerably higher,
    approaching ppm concentrations is some instances.', 'Given the limited clarity
    provided regarding the methods and meat sourcing, confidence in the findings was
    low.', The FDA is responsible for setting levels of tolerance for residues of
    hormones that may remain in animal products as a result of their administration
    to food animals., These levels are set as residue limits in the specific tissues
    of a particular species., No residue tolerance regulations are in place for TBA
    or zeranol; the rationale for their absence is likely the FDAs position that residues
    of human health concern are unlikely under permitted drug use specifications.,
  'Interestingly, in the aforementioned example, the agency notes that a marker residue
    is not needed because the tested edible tissues of steers are below codified safe
    concentrations.', 'Despite this logic, however, an examination of 30-day liver
    concentration of TBA is reported as mean: 85.23 ppb SD: 45.15 ppb, which is less
    than a single standard deviation away from the codified safe concentration of
    100 ppb.', 'aResidues of these compounds are not permitted in excess of these
    increments above the concentrations of these compounds naturally present in untreated
    animals

    Within the U.S., the National Residue Program  is the only federal effort that
    routinely examines animal products for drug residues.', Challenges exist in the
    utilization of NRP data for the purpose of understanding dietary hormone exposure.,
  'In its entire history, the NRP has only examined TBA, MGA, and zeranol.', 'There
    are year-to-year variations in which of these hormones is subjected to examination,
    and in some years, none are assessed.', 'Testing is performed in tissues not commonly
    consumed by people, requiring extrapolations to estimate concentrations in muscle
    tissue and milk.', 'Further, residue data reporting is extremely crude, and does
    not allow for the construction of residue concentration distributions or descriptive
    statistics.', 'Many of these shortcomings are likely a result of the core conflict
    between the purpose of the NRP and the need for exposure assessment, as the primary
    purpose of the NRPthe removal of animal products with violative residue levels
    from the food supplymay require data that is different from that needed to understand
    residue exposure in people.', 'Hormone monitoring in the USDA/FSIS National Residue
    Program, by year.', 'Data represent the number of samples examined under the monitoring
    program, which is the routine surveillance program.', 'A small number of additional
    samples are analyzed in selected years under inspector-generated mechanisms or
    in imported animal products


    Estimation of the intake of hormones through consumption of animal products requires
    an understanding of patterns of consumption for meat, milk, and egg products.',
  Nationwide dietary intake data  are collected in the What We Eat in America  dietary
    survey of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey., These data were
    analyzed by the EPA and reported by product as per capita or consumer-only intake
    rates in the 2011 Exposure Factors Handbook., 'In some cases, animal product intake
    rates are reported by life stage  or by race/ethnicity.', Table 3 summarizes intake
    rates from the EFH for animal products., 'Per capita intake rates for dairy products
    were the highest of all animal products among the general population, more than
    eight times that of beef or poultry, and nearly 17 times that of pork products.',
  'Based on survey data, the EPA reported that 88 %, 80 %, and 75 % of persons consume
    beef, pork, and poultry, respectively.', 'Consumption of meat and dairy products,
    on a body-weight-adjusted basis, is highest early in life.', The EFH includes
    some animal product intake data specific to premenopausal women., 'Women between
    the ages of 13 and 49 years consume approximately 20 % less meat and half the
    amount of dairy products compared to the general population, after adjusting for
    body weight.', 'While data specific to women 50 years of age and older were not
    available, estimates for persons 50+  suggest that both total meat intake and
    beef, poultry, and dairy product intake were further reduced from women aged 1349;
    pork intake was slightly higher.', Data for animal product-specific intake rates
    for postmenopausal women are needed in order to estimate dietary hormone exposure
    levels in this subpopulation., 'We have assembled literature relevant to the hazard
    identification, doseresponse assessment, and exposure assessment steps of the
    NRC risk paradigm.', Our review of the published literature has identified gaps
    in current knowledge germane to each step., A description of the most important
    of these gaps follows., There appears to be a lack of chronic  bioassays of oral
    toxicity of the seven hormone compounds in the published literature., 'While evaluations
    of these compounds are submitted to the FDA as part of the drug approval process,
    this information is not made available to the public for independent evaluation,
    and thus these evaluations cannot be used to estimate risks and related burdens
    for persons consuming animal products.', The existing literature primarily utilizes
    subcutaneous dose delivery in which the bioavailability of the administered dose
    approaches 100 %., This route does not account for variation in toxicological
    parameters that may result from differences in bioavailability or metabolism of
    compounds that can occur following oral exposure., 'Furthermore, the endpoints
    assessed in the published literature may not reflect an emerging understanding
    of the importance of upstream markers  on subsequent clinical disease.', 'Published
    animal studies have studied adverse effects resulting from exposure during key
    periods of pregnancy or pre-puberty, suggesting that the timing of exposure, in
    addition to the level of exposure, plays a key role in the biological significance
    of exposure to exogenous hormones.', 'Products containing the hormones reviewed
    in this paper were originally approved by the FDA several decades ago, using studies
    submitted by the industry; the most recent approval, for rBGH, came in 1993.',
  The agency based subsequent approvals of products that contained these compounds
    on the studies submitted in support of original approvals., The FDA also does
    not routinely review and update approvals., 'As a consequence, the approvals of
    many hormone products are based on studies conducted decades ago by companies
    seeking approval, and predate current scientific understanding of relevant human
    health risks, such as endocrine disruption.', 'The studies are not easily obtained
    by scientists outside the FDAtypically, only summaries of the studies are posted
    online, and access to older summaries not available online or studies that are
    referenced requires FOIA submission.', 'In our experience, including requests
    for hormone studies, the time from submission to receipt of records has spanned
    several years.', The ability to estimate dietary hormone exposure is severely
    hampered by the state of the existing literature., 'Residue depletion studies,
    which are submitted to the FDA as part of drug approvals, are difficult to access,
    and when access is possible, careful examination of study summaries suggests that
    conclusions drawn from these studies are not well founded.', Literature describing
    the residue content of retail animal products is limited; the best available studies
    primarily focus on estrogens in dairy products., Studies of retail animal tissue
    products are rare., 'Regulatory methods specified for analysis of TBA, MGA, and
    zeranol frequently rely on older GC-MS-based methods, and may not be on par with
    a wide array of newer available methods, which are supported by a rich literature.',
  Body-weight-adjusted per capita animal product intake estimates are available from
    the EPA EFH., 'These are the best-suited estimates for assessing levels of hormone
    exposure through food products, as they are derived from the most recent synthesis
    of NHANES dietary data.', 'The EPA estimates suggest that dairy products are consumed
    at considerably higher rates than other animal products, and that body-weight-adjusted
    animal product intake peaks early in life, and declines steadily over the remaining
    life stages.', 'Animal product consumption rates specific to postmenopausal women
    are not available in the EFH, though combined rates for all persons over 50 are
    available.', 'Data show that women of premenopausal age consumed approximately
    20 % less meat per body weight than the general population, and between 14 % and
    28 % less of specific meat types.', 'Animal product consumption rates were highest
    among non-whites, with consumption rates varying by product-race/ethnicity combination.',
  'In this review, we have identified key limitations that preclude conduct of quantitative
    doseresponse and exposure assessments.', 'As a result, at present, it is not possible
    to provide a quantitative characterization of risks that result from the use of
    hormonal drugs in food animal production.', 'As such, understanding the role of
    dietary hormone exposure in the population burden of breast cancer is not possible
    at this time.', 'In Table 4, we highlight critical gaps in our understanding of
    the population burden imposed by hormone use as well as potential opportunities
    for advancing the science.', Our review has revealed that numerous deficiencies
    exist in publicly available literature., 'Here, we identify key gaps in current
    knowledge and suggest opportunities for further research that would likely generate
    the foundation for interventions, if needed
