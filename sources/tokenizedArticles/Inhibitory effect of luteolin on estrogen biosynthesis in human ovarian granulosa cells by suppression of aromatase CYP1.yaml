text: ['Inhibition of aromatase, the key enzyme in estrogen biosynthesis, is an important
    strategy in the treatment of breast cancer.', 'Several dietary flavonoids show
    aromatase inhibitory activity, but their tissue specificity and mechanism remain
    unclear.', 'This study found that the dietary flavonoid luteolin potently inhibited
    estrogen biosynthesis in a dose- and time-dependent manner in KGN cells derived
    from human ovarian granulosa cells, the major source of estrogens in premenopausal
    women.', Luteolin decreased aromatase mRNA and protein expression in KGN cells.,
  'Luteolin also promoted aromatase protein degradation and inhibited estrogen biosynthesis
    in aromatase-expressing HEK293A cells, but had no effect on recombinant expressed
    aromatase.', 'Estrogen biosynthesis in KGN cells was inhibited with differing
    potencies by extracts of onion and bird chili and by four other dietary flavonoids:
    kaempferol, quercetin, myricetin, and isorhamnetin.', 'The present study suggests
    that luteolin inhibits estrogen biosynthesis by decreasing aromatase expression
    and destabilizing aromatase protein, and it warrants further investigation as
    a potential treatment for estrogen-dependent cancers.', Estrogen is a sex steroid
    hormone and plays a pivotal role in the regulation of many biological processes.,
  'Estrogen is known to induce physiological responses in the reproductive tract,
    mammary tissue, and the pituitary gland and to affect nonreproductive processes
    such as bone formation and cardiovascular health.', 'The biological actions of
    estrogen are mediated through nuclear and membrane estrogen receptors, which are
    expressed in a variety of cell types and mediate the genomic and nongenomic effects
    of estrogen.', 'Numerous factors have been implicated in the increased incidence
    of breast cancer in humans, including the Western-style diet and environmental
    endocrine-disrupting chemicals, which are thought to alter the production, metabolism,
    and action of estrogen.', 'Some ER antagonists such as tamoxifen and fulvestrant
    have been widely used to treat hormone-responsive breast cancer, but their clinical
    use is often limited by side effects including vaginal bleeding, thromboembolism,
    and increased risk of endometrial cancer.', Fruits and vegetables are rich in
    flavonoids such as genistein., 'These compounds are structurally similar to estrogen
    and are well-known for their cancer-preventive effects, which are partly mediated
    through competitive inhibition of the ER.', 'However, flavonoids also exhibit
    estrogenic activity that can enhance cell proliferation in the uterus and the
    mammary gland.', 'Thus, reduction of estrogen levels by means of inhibition of
    endogenous estrogen biosynthesis becomes another option in the prevention and
    treatment of estrogen-mediated carcinogenesis.', 'In humans, estrogen biosynthesis
    occurs at a number of different sites, with the major sites being the granulosa
    cells of the ovary in premenopausal women and stromal cells of the adipose tissue
    in postmenopausal women.', 'In women, estrogen is also produced locally at other
    sites, including the brain, bone, and breast.', 'Estrogen biosynthesis is catalyzed
    by aromatase, which binds the C19 androgenic steroid substrate and catalyzes successive
    reactions to form the phenolic A ring characteristic of estrogens.', 'In humans,
    aromatase expression at various sites is regulated by tissue-specific promoters
    by alternative splicing mechanisms.', 'In the ovary and testes, aromatase expression
    is controlled by promoter II, which binds the transcription factors cAMP-response
    element binding protein  and steroidogenic factor-1.', Aromatase expression in
    the gonads is thus regulated by gonadotropins through stimulation of cAMP generation.,
  'Aromatase inhibitors such as anastrozole, letrozole, and exemestane have been developed
    for the treatment of hormone-dependent breast cancer in postmenopausal women,
    and they show superior efficacy to conventional antiestrogen receptor drugs such
    as tamoxifen.', 'However, the estrogen deprivation that results from inhibition
    of aromatase activity leads to side effects such as increased risk for osteoporosis
    and cardiovascular disease.', 'Thus, there remains a need to discover and develop
    novel aromatase inhibitors that offer greater clinical efficacy and fewer side
    effects than the currently available drugs.', Several natural flavonoids are known
    to be potent aromatase inhibitors; this activity partly contributes to the importance
    of certain vegetables and fruits in the daily diet to decrease the risk of chronic
    diseases., Luteolin  is one of the most common flavonoids present in edible and
    medicinal plants., 'Preclinical studies have shown that this compound possesses
    a variety of pharmacological activities, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory,
    antimicrobial, and anticancer activities.', 'Accumulating evidence suggests that
    luteolin could be developed as an anticancer agent to sensitize some tumor cells,
    such as tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand-sensitive or -resistant
    cancer cells and hepatoma cells, for apoptosis.', Luteolin has also been proposed
    to be a promising adjuvant for multiple sclerosis therapy due to its additive
    effects with interferon- in modulating the immune responses of peripheral blood
    mononuclear cells isolated from multiple sclerosis patients., 'Dietary sources
    of luteolin include celery, green peppers, bird chili, onion, parsley, cabbages,
    and apple skin.', 'Although luteolin is found to inhibit estrogen biosynthesis
    in breast cancer MCF-7 cells, preadipocyte cells and placental choriocarcinoma
    JEG-3 cells, its tissue specificity and mechanism of action remain poorly understood.',
  'In this study, we investigated the effect and mechanism of luteolin on estrogen
    biosynthesis in human ovarian granulosa-like KGN cells.', We also compared the
    effects of luteolin on estrogen biosynthesis with those of other commonly consumed
    flavonoids and vegetables., 'Luteolin, quercetin, kaempferol, myricetin, and isorhamnetin
    were purchased from Must Biotechnology Co., Ltd.. Testosterone, formestane, forskolin,
    and protease inhibitor cocktail were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co.. Bird chili  and
    onion  were purchased from a market near the institute and were identified by
    one of the authors.', 'The pCMV6-aromatase plasmid was purchased from OriGene,
    and the pSV--galactosidase plasmid was purchased from Promega.', 'Human ovarian
    granulosa-like KGN cells  were maintained in Dulbeccos modified Eagle medium/Hams
    F-12 nutrient mix  medium  supplemented with 5%  fetal bovine serum, penicillin,
    and streptomycin  at 37 C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere.', 'Human embryonic
    kidney 293A  cells  were cultured at 37 C in DMEM supplemented with 10%  fetal
    bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin.', 'For the transient transfections,
    subconfluent HEK293A cells grown in 24-well plates were cotransfected with 0.5
    g of pCMV6-aromatase plasmid and 0.3 g of pSV--galactosidase plasmid using Trans-EZ
    transfection reagent according to the the manufacturers protocol.', Aromatase
    activity was normalized to -galactosidase activity to allow for differences in
    transfection efficiency., KGN cells were seeded into 96-well plates  DMEM/F-12
    medium at 37 C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere., 'Compounds were then added
    to the cells, and the plates were incubated for a further 24 h. Alamar Blue reagent  was
    added, and the fluorescence intensities were measured using a Verioskan Flash
    Multimode Reader with excitation at 544 nm and emission at 590 nm.', Cytotoxicity
    was defined as the ratio of the fluorescence intensity in test wells to that in
    solvent control wells., The assay was conducted three times in triplicate., The
    IC50 value was obtained by fitting doseresponse data to a four-parametric logistic
    nonlinear regression model using GraphPad Prism 5.0 software., KGN cells or transiently
    transfected HEK293A cells were seeded in 24-well plates and cultured overnight.,
  'The next day, the medium was replaced with serum-free medium, and the cells were
    pretreated for 24 h with the test chemicals.', 'Testosterone  was then added to
    each well, and the cells were incubated for a further 24 h. At the end of this
    incubation, the culture supernatants were collected and stored at 20 C. Levels
    of 17-estradiol in the supernatants were quantified using a magnetic particle-based
    enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay  according to the manufacturers instructions.',
  Optical densities  were measured at 550 nm using a Verioskan Flash Multimode Reader.,
  Results were normalized to the total cellular protein content and were expressed
    as percentage 17-estradiol production compared with the control samples., Protein
    determination was carried out with a bicinchoninic acid  protein assay kit., 'For
    the calculation of the IC50 value of luteolin in inhibiting estrogen biosynthesis,
    various concentrations of luteolin  were used to treat KGN cells for 24 h. Testosterone  was
    then added to each well, and the cells were incubated for a further 24 h. The
    IC50 value was obtained by fitting doseresponse data to a four-parametric logistic
    nonlinear regression model using GraphPad Prism 5.0 software.', An in vitro recombinant
    expressed aromatase activity assay was conducted as described previously with
    minor modifications., 'In brief, the test compounds  were preincubated with an
    NADPH regenerating system  for 10 min at 37 C before 50 L of the enzyme and substrate
    mixture  was added.', The reaction mixture was then incubated for 2 h at 37 C
    to allow the aromatase to generate the product and then quenched with 37.5 L of
    2 N NaOH., The mixture was then shaken for 5 min and incubated for 2 h at 37 C
    to enhance the noise/background ratio., The fluorescence intensity was measured
    at 485 nm  and 530 nm., Three independent experiments were performed in duplicate.,
  Cells cultured in 60 mm dishes were lysed with RIPA lysis buffer  supplemented with
    protease inhibitor cocktail., The protein concentration was determined by using
    a BCA protein assay kit., 'Aliquots of total cell lysates  were mixed in loading
    buffer, boiled for 5 min, and subjected to SDS-PAGE.', Proteins were blotted onto
    nitrocellulose membranes., The membranes were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin
    and then incubated at 4 C overnight with rabbit anti-human aromatase monoclonal
    antibody  or rabbit anti-human GAPDH monoclonal antibody., Membranes were then
    incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary
    antibody  and developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system.,
  The intensity of each signal was determined by a computer image analysis system.,
  Total cellular RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent according to the manufacturers
    instructions., The purity of extracted RNA was determined by examining the ratio
    of the absorbance at 260 and 280 nm using a Verioskan Flash Multimode Reader.,
  The value of 1.82.0 for A260/A280 indicates that the RNA is pure., The concentration
    of extracted RNA was determined by examining the absorbance at 260 nm., An A260
    reading of 1.0 is univalent to 40 g/mL of RNA., Total RNA  was reverse-transcribed
    using SuperScript III rReverse Transcriptase  with oligo18 primers., Equal amounts
    of cDNA were subjected to real-time quantitative PCR with the fluorescent dye
    SYBR Green I using a Chromo4 detection system., 'Reaction mixtures contained 12.5
    L of 2 TransStart Top Green qPCR SuperMix, 0.5 L of each primer, and 1 L of template
    cDNA.', 'Sterile distilled water was added to a final volume of 25 L. The primer
    pair for aromatase was 5-ACCCTTCTGCGTCGTGTC-3  and 5-TCTGTGGAAATCCTGCGTCTT-3,
    and that for GAPDH was 5-CCACCCATGGCAAATTCCATGGCA-3  and 5-GGTGGACCTGACCTGCCGTCTAGA-3.',
  'The thermal cycling conditions comprised an initial denaturation step at 95 C for
    10 s, followed by 40 cycles of 95 C for 5 s, 54 C for 15 s, and 72 C for 15 s.
    Standard curves were established for each primer set, and both reference and target
    gene reactions were performed for each sample.', The relative quantity  of aromatase
    mRNA was calculated by the   method by using GAPDH amplified from the same sample
    as a reference., Samples of bird chili and onion were extracted and hydrolyzed
    to aglycons using a method modified from that of Miean et al., 'Briefly, the fresh
    plants  were cleaned, cut into pieces, and oven-dried at 50 C. After the addition
    of 100 mL of 90% methanol containing 2 mg/mL tert-butylhydroquinoneTBHQ) and 10
    mL of 6 M HCl, the extracts were mixed and refluxed at 100 C for 2 h. The extracts
    were then filtered and concentrated to dryness by evaporation.', The resultant
    flavonoid aglycons were quantified by reversed-phase HPLC  on an Agilent C18 column  using
    methanol/0.4% aqueous phosphoric acid  as mobile phase  and UV detection  at the
    flow rate of 1 mL/min., 'The contents of luteolin and quercetin were calculated
    in triplicate for each sample on the basis of the external standard technique,
    from a standard curve of peak area versus concentration.', Statistical analyses
    were performed with GraphPad Prism 5.0 software., Results are expressed as the
    mean  standard deviation of individual values from three independent experiments.,
  Data were compared by one-way ANOVA followed by Duncans multiple-range tests., P
    values of ;0.05 were considered to be statistically significant., 'Effect of Luteolin
    on Estrogen Biosynthesis in Human Ovarian Granulosa-like KGN Cells


    We screened a chemical library consisting of 1431 natural products for small molecule
    modulators of estrogen biosynthesis and identified luteolin, a natural flavone,
    as a potent inhibitor of estrogen biosynthesis in human granulosa-like KGN cells.',
  The chemical structure of luteolin is given in Figure 1A., 'To examine the effect
    of luteolin on 17-estradiol synthesis, KGN cells were incubated for 24 h with
    various concentrations of the test compounds followed by a further 24 h incubation
    with testosterone.', 'As shown in Figure 1B, forskolin, which is an adenylate
    cyclase agonist and up-regulates aromatase expression by increasing intracellular
    cAMP levels and activating the protein kinase A /CREB pathway, significantly increased
    the production of 17-estradiol, whereas formestane, an aromatase inhibitor in
    clinical use for the treatment of breast cancer, significantly inhibited 17-estradiol
    biosynthesis.', These results indicated that the established assay is suitable
    for examining the effect of bioactive compounds on estrogen biosynthesis., 'At
    10 M, luteolin  significantly inhibited 17-estradiol biosynthesis and had a more
    potent effect than 50 M formestane.', Luteolin at 10 M also potently inhibited
    forskolin-induced 17-estradiol biosynthesis., Figure 1., 'Effect of luteolin on
    estrogen biosynthesis in KGN cells:  presents the chemical structure of luteolin.',

    examine the effect of luteolin on estrogen biosynthesis in more detail, KGN cells
    were treated with luteolin at concentrations between 1 nM and 50 M. As shown in
    Figure 1C, luteolin inhibited 17-estradiol biosynthesis in a concentration-dependent
    manner, with a calculated IC50 value of 1.17 M. Inhibition of 17-estradiol biosynthesis
    by luteolin also exhibited a time-dependence manner.', 'Inhibition of estrogen
    secretion was first evident at 12 h and was sustained until 96 h, when 17-estradiol
    biosynthesis was inhibited by approximately 80% compared with the control.', The
    tested concentrations of luteolin were not cytotoxic to KGN cells., These results
    indicate that luteolin could potently inhibit the biosynthesis of estrogen in
    human ovarian granulosa cells., KGN cells lack endogenous 17-hydroxylase and cannot
    synthesize androgens or estrogens de novo., 'Therefore, the 17-estradiol measured
    in the culture supernatants was likely synthesized from the exogenously added
    testosterone through the action of aromatasethe only enzyme able to convert testosterone
    to 17-estradiol.', 'To determine whether luteolin inhibits 17-estradiol biosynthesis
    through an effect on aromatase, we examined aromatase mRNA and protein levels
    in KGN cells treated with luteolin.', 'As previously reported, we found that aromatase
    mRNA levels were significantly increased in cells treated by forskolin and significantly
    inhibited by formestane.', Luteolin inhibited aromatase transcript levels by about
    50% compared with the DMSO-treated control cells., Aromatase protein expression
    was also examined by Western blotting of KGN cell lysates following treatment
    with luteolin., 'Consistent with their effects on aromatase transcription, luteolin
    and formestane treatmenta of KGN cells reduced the expression of aromatase protein,
    whereas forskolin treatment increased the expression.', These results indicate
    that luteolin inhibits estrogen biosynthesis in KGN cells by decreasing the expression
    of aromatase., Figure 2., Luteolin inhibits aromatase expression in KGN cells.,
  'KGN cells were pretreated for 24 h with 10 M luteolin, 10 M forskolin, or 50 M

    in Aromatase-Expressing HEK293A Cells


    To further confirm that luteolin exerts it inhibitory effect on estrogen biosynthesis
    by suppression of aromatase, HEK293A cells, which do not express aromatase, were
    transiently transfected with an aromatase expression vector and then treated with
    luteolin before the addition of testosterone.', 'As shown in Figure 3A, 17-estradiol
    biosynthesis by HEK293A cells was decreased by formestane and by luteolin in a
    concentration-dependent manner, consistent with the results in KGN cells.', 'Furthermore,
    luteolin at 50 M was found to significantly decrease aromatase protein expression
    in HEK293A cells compared with the DMSO- or formestane-treated cells.', These
    results indicate that luteolin exerts it inhibitory effect on estrogen biosynthesis
    by promoting aromatase protein degradation., Figure 3., Effect of luteolin on
    estrogen biosynthesis in aromatase-expressing HEK293A cells., HEK293A cells were
    cotransfected with pCMV6-aromatase and pSV--galactosidase expression plasmids.,
  'After 24 h, the cells were incubated with the indicated compounds for an additional
    24 h, and then testosterone was added for a further 24 h.  17-Estradiol concentrations

    have long been found to act directly on aromatase to inhibit its catalytic activity.,
  'To examine whether luteolin can directly inhibit aromatase activity, we conducted
    an in vitro assay by using recombinant expressed aromatase.', 'As shown in Figure
    4, formestane inhibited aromatase activity in a concentration-dependent manner,
    as reported.', 'Compared with that, luteolin had no effect on aromatase activity.',
  These results indicate that luteolin does not directly inhibit aromatase activity
    as other active flavonoids generally do., Figure 4., Effect of luteolin on aromatase
    activity in vitro., An in vitro aromatase assay using recombinant expressed aromatase
    and dibenzylfluorescein as a substrate was conducted as described under Materials
    and Methods., 'Various concentrations of formestane and luteolin were added into

    flavonoids found in commonly consumed vegetables and fruits on estrogen biosynthesis.,
  'First, KGN cells were treated with various concentrations of kaempferol, quercetin,
    myricetin, or isorhamnetin to test their effects on cell viability and to determine
    the optimal concentrations for estrogen biosynthesis assays.', The chemical structures
    of these flavonoids are given in Figure 5A., 'As shown in Figure 5B, kaempferol
    inhibited 17-estradiol biosynthesis by KGN cells in a concentration-dependent
    manner, with approximately 30 and 50% inhibition following treatment with 10 and
    50 M kaempferol, respectively.', Quercetin inhibited 17-estradiol biosynthesis
    by up to 75% at a high concentration  but increased 17-estradiol biosynthesis
    slightly when added at low concentrations., Myricetin inhibited 17-estradiol biosynthesis
    at a low concentration  but had no effect at higher concentrations., 'In contrast,
    isorhamnetin had no effect on 17-estradiol biosynthesis at any concentration examined.',
  'These results indicate that kaempferol and quercetin potently inhibit estrogen

    natural sources of luteolin; therefore, we next investigated whether extracts
    of onion or bird chili could affect estrogen biosynthesis.', 'Quantification of
    quercetin and luteolin in the extracts indicated that onion contained high amounts
    of both quercetin and luteolin, whereas bird chili contained relatively low levels
    of both compounds.', KGN cells were treated with various noncytotoxic concentrations
    of the extracts., 'As shown in Figure 6A, a high concentration  of onion extract
    potently inhibited 17-estradiol biosynthesis, whereas the bird chili extract had
    no such effect.', We then examined the effect of onion extracts on aromatase expression
    in KGN cells., 'As shown in Figure 6B, onion extracts  could significantly decrease
    aromatase protein expression.', We also examined the effect of the vegetable extracts
    on estrogen biosynthesis in aromatase-expressing HEK293A cells., 'In contrast
    to the effects on KGN cells, both onion and bird chili extracts significantly
    inhibited 17-estradiol biosynthesis in HEK293A cells in a concentration-dependent

    and Bird Chili Extracts  \n\nIn the ovary, a major tissue for estrogen biosynthesis
    in premenopausal women, aromatase expression is regulated through a follicle-stimulating
    hormone-mediated cAMP pathway.", 'In the present study, we found luteolin could
    significantly decrease aromatase mRNA expression in KGN cells derived from the
    ovary.', This is consistent with an observation in MCF-7 breast cancer cells that
    luteolin inhibits AP-1 binding in the I.3/II promoter region of aromatase and
    reduces aromatase mRNA expression., 'In KGN cells, aromatase expression is mainly
    controlled by promoter II; thus, it is possible that luteolin inhibits aromatase
    expression in these cells by similar mechanism a to that in MCF-7 cells.', 'Luteolin
    has been shown to decrease intracellular cAMP levels and inhibit melanin production
    in B16 melanoma cells treated with -melanocyte-stimulating hormone, further indicating
    that luteolin may modulate the cAMP pathway to decrease aromatase transcription
    in KGN cells.', 'Exemestane, an aromatase inhibitor used clinically, has been
    shown to promote aromatase degradation through the ubiquitin/26S proteasome pathway
    in aromatase-overexpressing MCF-7 cells without effect on the aromatase mRNA expression.',
  'Similar to this, we found that luteolin significantly promoted aromatase degradation
    in aromatase-transfected HEK293A cells, in which the expression of aromatase was
    driven by a constitutive CMV promoter.', 'Luteolin is not a general gene expression
    inhibitor and has no effect on CMV promoter-driven gene transcription, so it may
    directly change the aromatase stability at the protein level.', 'Luteolin promotes
    the X-linked inhibitor of apopotosis protein ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation
    by inhibition of protein kinase C. Thus, it will be of great interest to investigate
    whether luteolin and exemestane promote aromatase degradation by the same mechanism
    and whether PKC is a novel regulator for aromatase ubiquitination and proteasomal
    degradation.', 'No direct inhibitory effect of luteolin on recombinant expressed
    aromatase was observed, which was inconsistent with the observation that luteolin
    can inhibit aromatase activity by using partially purified aromatase prepared
    from human placenta.', This discrepancy is possible due to the different in vitro
    assay methods used., 'However, we found that luteolin exhibited the aromatase
    inhibitory effect only beginning at 12 h, indicating it may not directly inhibit
    the enzyme catalytic activity.', 'Thus, whether luteolin can directly modulate
    the catalytic activity of aromatase needs to be further studied.', 'Taken together
    with previous observations that some flavonoids such as apigenin and kaempferol
    can directly inhibit the catalytic activity of aromatase in placental microsomes
    or purified aromatase, our results indicate that inhibition of aromatase by flavonoids
    may result from inhibition of aromatase expression, aromatase catalytic activity,
    and/or destabilization of aromatase protein.', Aromatase inhibitors derived from
    food sources or traditional medicines are preferred for more tissue specificity
    and less toxicity than those currently in clinical use., 'We compared five widely
    consumed food-derived flavonoidsluteolin, isorhamnetin, quercetin, kaempferol,
    and myricetinfor their ability to inhibit aromatase activity.', 'All except isorhamnetin
    could inhibit aromatase activity, albeit with differing potencies.', 'Luteolin,
    one of the potent naturally occurring aromatase inhibitors, is present in many
    vegetables and fruits known to have multiple health benefits.', One of the prominent
    side effects of clinically used aromatase inhibitors is the increased risk for
    osteoporosis due to whole-body depletion of estrogen., 'However, luteolin has
    been found to have antiosteoporotic effects in vitro and in vivo through stimulation
    of osteoblast function and inhibition of osteoclast function.', Luteolin appears
    to be a safe natural flavonoid because long-term administration to rats  did not
    reveal any obvious toxicity., 'Thus, it will be important to examine whether luteolin
    can inhibit estrogen biosynthesis in vivo.', A maximal plasma concentration of
    3 M luteolin was measured following oral dosing of rats with 15 mg/kg luteolin.,
  'In the present study, we found that luteolin inhibited estrogen biosynthesis at
    a concentration as low as 1 M. Thus, oral dosing with luteolin could achieve physiologically
    relevant plasma concentrations to inhibit aromatase enzyme activity and expression,
    making it one of the most promising flavonoids for therapeutic targeting of aromatase.',
  'Flavonoids with potent aromatase inhibitory activities, such as chrysin, naringenin,
    and apigenin, failed to inhibit uterine growth via aromatase in vivo.', The contradiction
    was possibly due to the negative feedback effect of estrogen depletion by increased
    secretion of follicle-stimulating hormone from the hypothalamus in rats with functional
    ovaries., 'Thus, the ovariectomized rats with the aromatase-overexpressing MCF-7
    breast tumor should be used to evaluate the efficacy of these flavonoids, including
    luteolin, in the inhibition of aromatase-mediated breast tumorigenesis in vivo
    to obviate such negative feedback effect.', Overexposure to environmental estrogenic
    compounds and the Western-style diet have contributed to the increased incidence
    of breast cancer., 'In contrast, consumption of large quantities of fruits and
    vegetables conveys protection against a variety of cancers, including breast cancer.',
  'It has been found that red wine, grape seed, white button mushroom, and beer can
    inhibit aromatase activity and modulate estrogen biosynthesis.', 'Despite this,
    the role of fruits and vegetables in endogenous estrogen biosynthesis is still
    largely unknown.', 'In this study, we compared two luteolin-containing vegetablesonion
    and bird chilifor their effects on estrogen biosynthesis.', 'Interestingly, onion
    extracts significantly inhibited estrogen biosynthesis in both KGN cells and aromatase-expressing
    HEK293A cells, whereas bird chili extracts inhibited estrogen biosynthesis only
    in the HEK293A cells.', 'The difference is possibly due to the cell permeability
    of the compounds, their composition, or concentration range of flavonoids contained
    in the food source.', Different combinations of flavonoids may also change the
    solubility and/or accessibility of the compounds to intracellular aromatase or
    may act on aromatase through different mechanisms., 'As an example, some dietary
    flavonoids such as hesperetin can increase aromatase expression.', 'Thus, the
    composition and concentrations of flavonoids and the cell type being tested should
    be considered when fruits and vegetables are compared for their effects on estrogen
    biosynthesis.', 'In conclusion, we identified luteolin, distributed widely in
    consumed fruits and vegetables, as a potent inhibitor of estrogen biosynthesis
    in human ovarian granulosa-like KGN cells by decreasing aromatase expression and
    promoting its degradation.', 'We also showed that other daily consumed flavonoids,
    including isorhamnetin, quercetin, kaempferol, and myricetin, inhibited estrogen
    biosynthesis with differing potencies.', 'Two widely consumed vegetables, onion
    and bird chili, also differed in their ability to inhibit estrogen biosynthesis
    in KGN cells and in aromatase-expressing HEK293A cells.', 'The present study suggests
    that luteolin may exert its estrogen biosynthesis inhibitory effect through suppression
    of aromatase expression and promotion of aromatase degradation, and it warrants
    further investigation as a potential agent for the treatment of breast cancer.',
  'Consumption of fruits and vegetables rich in flavonoids will be helpful for reducing
    endogenous estrogen levels in the prevention of estrogen-dependent disease, such
    as breast cancer.', 'Cytotoxic effects of luteolin, kaempferol, quercetin, myricetin,
    isorhamnetin, and plant extracts on KGN or HEK293A cells.', 'This material is
