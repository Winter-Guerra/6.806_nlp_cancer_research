    fruits and vegetables will increase consumer confidence in fresh produce.', 'This
    study was conducted to investigate the effects of irradiation at 1 kGy, a dose
    that potentially inactivates E. coli O157:H7 by 5 logs, on the quality of 13 common
    fresh-cut vegetables: iceberg, romaine, green and red leaf lettuce, spinach, tomato,
    cilantro, parsley, green onion, carrot, broccoli, red cabbage, and celery.', 'The
    results showed that the appearance of irradiated samples was similar to the nonirradiated
    ones except that irradiated carrots, celery, cilantro, and green onions had higher
    appearance scores than corresponding nonirradiated vegetables.', There was no
    difference in the instrumental texture between irradiated samples and nonirradiated
    ones., 'The aroma of several irradiated vegetables was significantly better than
    controls after 14-d storage, because these control samples decayed or senesced.',
  'The 1 kGy irradiation did not affect vitamin C content of most vegetables; however,
    irradiated green and red leaf lettuce had 24% to 53% lower vitamin C contents
    than the controls.', Our results suggest that most fresh-cut fruits and vegetables
    tested can tolerate up to 1 kGy irradiation without significant losses in any
    of the quality attributes., Consumers are strongly encouraged to eat more produce
    for their well-known benefits., 'Unfortunately, in recent years, there has been
    an increase in the number of outbreaks and recalls associated with consumption
    of fresh produce due to contamination with human pathogens such as Escherichia
    coli O157:H7.', 'Between 1996 and 2006, there were more outbreaks of foodborne
    illnesses associated with fresh produce than any other categories of foods.',
  'Of these produce related outbreaks, 25% were associated with fresh-cut produce.',
  'Although the reasons for this increase in fresh produce-related foodborne illnesses
    are not fully understood, centralized processing plants with wide distribution,
    an increase in global trade, a longer food chain, an increase in produce consumption,
    and an aging population that is susceptible to foodborne illness all may play
    a role.', 'Fresh produce is usually consumed raw, and there is no kill step to
    eliminate pathogens.', 'However, the fresh produce industry is in need of a kill
    step to ensure the safety of produce.', 'Ionizing irradiation is known to effectively
    eliminate human pathogens such as E. coli O157:H7 on fresh produce.', 'However,
    the commercial application of irradiation to fresh produce is still limited partially
    due to concerns about possible damages to sensory and nutritional quality.', There
    have been many studies concerning the irradiation of fresh and fresh-cut fruits
    and vegetables., 'However, most of the studies focused on only 1 or 2 fruits and
    vegetables.', There is no comprehensive study of major fresh-cut vegetables in
    a single study., 'In addition, fresh-cut produce was not properly packaged in
    some studies.', 'Commercially, some fresh-cut vegetables are packaged in modified
    atmosphere packages  while others are packaged in perforated packages that allow
    easy exchange of atmosphere.', 'The D-values  of E. coli O157:H7 on fresh-cut
    vegetables were mostly between 0.12 and 0.20 kGy.', 'Therefore, a dose of 1 kGy
    irradiation can achieve at least a 5 log reduction of E. coli O157:H7, surface
    inoculated on fresh produce, although the internalized pathogens may better able
    to survive irradiation than those on the surface.', 'In the recent proposal of
    labeling changes, FDA expressed interest in information on whether the control
    of foodborne pathogens by irradiation changes the characteristics of food in a
    way that is outside of the normal variability of the food and would therefore
    require additional labeling to inform the consumer of such change.', 'The objective
    of this study was to study the effects of 1 kGy irradiation on the appearance,
    texture, aroma, and vitamin C content of major fresh-cut vegetables packaged in
    either MAP or air.', 'Thirteen fresh-cut vegetables were used: iceberg, romaine,
    red leaf, and green leaf lettuce, cilantro, parsley, green onion, carrot, broccoli,
    red cabbage, spinach, celery, and tomato.', 'These vegetables were chosen because
    of their economic importance, or their possible association with contamination
    by foodborne pathogens and outbreaks of illnesses, or both.', 'The fresh-cut vegetables
    were either prepared in the laboratory from the whole, uncut commodity or purchased
    as a fresh-cut product from distributors through local supermarkets.', 'Packaged
    fresh-cut broccoli, shredded carrots and red cabbage, iceberg and romaine lettuce,
    and spinach were obtained from local supermarkets and used without further preparation.',
  Only products that had at least 7 d of shelf life  were purchased., 'Cilantro and
    parsley  purchased from a wholesale market were washed in 20 L water first, cut
    into 2 to 3 cm segments in length, and dipped in chlorine solution  for 2 min,
    followed by rinsing in 20 L deionized water.', 'Green onions were cut into 1 to
    2 cm segments, and celery  was cut into approximately 1 cm segments before being
    treated with chlorine solution  and rinsed with water.', 'In addition to the prepackaged
    iceberg lettuce, fresh-cut iceberg lettuce was also prepared in the laboratory
    and stored in perforated bags.', 'Whole iceberg, red leaf, and green leaf lettuces
    were cut into 3  3 cm pieces and dipped in 100 ppm chlorine solution for 2 min
    before being rinsed in water.', The fresh-cut samples prepared in the lab were
    packaged into 2 perforated  zipper bags., 'Tomatoes were dipped into 100 ppm chlorine
    solution for 2 min before being sliced  using a sharp knife, and packaged in 16-oz
    clamshell  containers.', 'The amounts of samples in each package varied  as follows:
    tomato, 175 g; red and green leaf lettuce, 105 g; iceberg lettuce, 150 g, green
    onions, 130 g; parsley, 110 g; cilantro, 105 g; celery, 150 g. All samples were
    cooled on ice for 3 h before being irradiated with gamma rays at a dose of 0 kGy  or
    1 kGy at 4 C. There were 4 replicates for each treatment per sampling day.', 'The
    following vegetables were packaged in modified atmosphere: broccoli, carrots,
    iceberg and romaine lettuce, red cabbage, spinach, and tomato.', 'For all the
    vegetables except tomato, atmosphere had already been established in the packages
    by commercial processors when the samples were purchased.', The nature of package
    material was unknown because they were considered proprietary., 'For tomato, modified
    atmosphere in the polystyrene clamshell was established as a result of respiration.',
  The rest of the fresh-cut vegetables and iceberg lettuce were packaged in perforated
    film bags that freely allowed gas exchange., 'After irradiation of the packaged
    vegetables, all samples were stored at 4 C for 14 d. Gas composition in the packages
    were measured first followed by evaluation of aroma, appearance, texture, and
    vitamin C content of the samples after 1- and 14-d storage.', The samples were
    irradiated using a self-contained cesium-137 gamma radiation source  with a dose
    rate of 0.089 kGy/min., 'Variations in radiation dose absorption were minimized
    by placing the samples within a uniform area of the radiation field, by irradiating
    them within a polypropylene container  to absorb Compton electrons, and by using
    the same geometry for sample irradiation during the entire study.', 'During irradiation,
    temperature  in the radiation chamber was controlled by flushing the gas phase
    of liquid nitrogen into the upper portion of the chamber.', 'To eliminate possible
    effects of nitrogen flushing during irradiation, bags of all treatments  were
    placed in the chamber with nitrogen flushing for the same total period.', Routine
    dosimetry was performed using 5-mm-dia alanine pellets., 'The pellets were placed
    in 1.2 mL cryogenic vials, and the cryogenic vials were placed with the samples
    prior to irradiation.', Alanine pellets were read using a Bruker EMS 104 EPR analyzer
    and compared with a standard curve., Actual dose was typically within 5% of the
    targeted doses., Maximum/minimum dose ratio was 1.1., Evaluations of aroma and
    appearance were conducted using a 9-point category scale., 'For aroma, judges
    opened the packages, sniffed the headspace, and gave a rating using a 9-point
    scale: 9 = strong, characteristic odor; 7 = slightly flat; 5 = bland, faint odor
    or detectable off-odor; 3 = mild off-odors; 1 = distinct rotten smell or other
    strong off-odors.', 'For visual quality, the description for the scales was 9
    = excellent quality, essentially free from defects, fresh appearing; 7 = good
    quality, minor defects; 5 = fair quality, slightly to moderately objectionable
    defects, lower limit of sale appeal; 3 = poor quality, excessive defects; 1 =
    extremely poor quality, not usable.', Pictures that corresponded to each scale
    point were available for judges to rate the samples., Three experienced judges
    independently performed subjective assessments., 'For evaluating aroma, the 1st
    judge opened the packages and sniffed the headspace of a sample and gave it to
    the second and then to the 3rd judge right away without any delay.', 'Thus, each
    judge evaluated all samples for aroma and appearance.', There were 4 replicated
    packages for each treatment/sampling day., Gases within the sealed packages were
    sampled to determine the levels of CO2 and O2 after 1 and 14 d after irradiation.,
  'To measure the atmosphere, a 0.5 mL headspace sample was withdrawn from the bags
    using a syringe by piercing the films or trays with a fine hypodermic needle.',
  'The sampling hole was resealed with a patch of electrical tape, and the contents
    of the packages were used in subsequent quality analysis.', The gas samples were
    then injected into a Gow-Mac Series 580 gas chromatograph  equipped with a 183
    cm CTR I column  and a thermal conductivity detector., The CTR I column consists
    of an outer column  packed with an activated molecular sieve and an inner column  packed
    with a porous polymer mixture., 'The injector, oven, and detector temperatures
    were held at ambient temperature.', The carrier gas was helium with a flow rate
    at 120 mL/min., CO2 and O2 levels were calculated by comparing the peak heights
    of samples to those of a standard gas mix of 3% CO2 and 17% O2., Texture was determined
    using the TA-XT2i texture analyzer  with specified shearing devices for different
    vegetables., 'To measure texture of broccoli, similar diameters  of broccoli stem
    were first transversely cut into 1-cm-long pieces.', 'To measure texture, the
    pieces were turned on their sides so that the TA-43 blade with flat 3 mm end longitudinally
    cut through the pieces.', Celery texture was similarly measured after being cut
    into 1-cm-long pieces., Five pieces of broccoli stem and celery from each bag
    were used., The total number of measurements per treatment was 20., 'For carrots,
    5 shredded carrot strips  from each bag were cut using a Warner-Bratzler shear
    blade.', 'For red cabbage, green and red leaf lettuce, iceberg and romaine lettuce,
    and spinach 15 g samples were placed into a Kramer Shear press with 5 blades.',
  'For cilantro and parsley, 10 g of the sample were placed into the press, while
    for tomato, 50 g samples were placed into the press.', 'For green onions, 3 g
    samples were placed into a mini Kramer Shear press.', 'For all the samples, the
    5 flat plunger devices were set at 70 mm  or 20 mm  from the bottom of the rectangular
    sample holding box, moved down to the sample at a speed of 2 mm/s, compressed
    the samples through the 5 slots, and stopped when it reached 5 mm below the bottom
    of the holding box.', Forces over time were recorded using the texture expert
    software., The maximum shear force and the area under the force-time curve were
    then calculated., Vitamin C  was analyzed as described previously., Samples  were
    homogenized with 20 mL 5%  metaphosphoric acid  using a homogenizer  at a speed
    setting of 70 for 1 min., 'The homogenate was filtered through 4 layers of cheesecloth,
    and then the filtrate was centrifuged at 10000 g for 10 min at 4 C in a Sorvall
    RC2-B refrigerated centrifuge.', 'To reduce dehydroascorbic acid in the supernatant
    to AA, 1 mL aliquot supernatant  was added to 0.16 mL of 30 mM DL-homocysteine
    solution, and the pH was adjusted to 6.5 to 7.0 by slow addition of approximately
    0.13 mL 2.6 M dipotassium hydrogen phosphate.', 'After 30 min at 23 C, the reaction
    was stopped by addition of 5%  MPA to 2 mL.', The mixture was filtered through
    a 0.45 m PVDF Durapore Millex-HV syringe filter., The filtered samples were placed
    in 2 mL vials and analyzed using Hewlett Packard Ti-series 1050 HPLC system.,
  'The HPLC system consists of an autosampler, an integral photodiode-array detector,
    an autoinjector, and a Hewlett-Packard Rev.', A02., 05 Chemstation., Injection
    volume was 20 L. Separation of compounds was achieved with an Aminex HPX-87H organic
    acids column  fitted with a microguard cation H+ by elution with a mobile phase
    of 5 mM sulfuric acid at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min., Column temperature was maintained
    at 30 C using a column heater., 'AA was monitored at 245 nm, and the sample AA
    content was calculated from an AA standard.', The experiment was conducted using
    a complete random design., The experiments were repeated 4 times., Data were subjected
    to statistical analysis using SAS ver., 8e., The least significant difference  test
    was performed using the general linear models  procedure., 'One day after irradiation,
    packages of irradiated broccoli had significantly  lower O2 levels  than the controls.',
  There were no other differences in O2 and CO2 levels in the other packages of fresh-cut
    vegetables between irradiated and control samples., 'After 14 d of storage, the
    O2 and CO2 levels were similar among the irradiated and nonirradiated samples
    except for irradiated carrots, which had higher CO2 and lower O2 than the control
    samples, which were completely rotted.', The O2 levels in the packages of spinach
    and tomato were not much different from those in air., O2 levels were below 10%
    in the packages of broccoli and romaine and iceberg lettuce while the CO2 levels
    in the packages were between 5% and 12%., The low O2 level in the irradiated broccoli
    observed at day 1 indicated that irradiation might increase respiration rate.,
  'However, the increases were temporary.', 'During storage, the O2 and CO2 levels
    did not change much in the packages of any vegetable except tomato whose O2 levels
    decreased.', 'One day after irradiation, there was no significant  difference
    in the appearance between the irradiated samples and the corresponding controls
    for any of the vegetables.', 'After 14-d storage, irradiated carrots, celery,
    cilantro, and green onions had significantly better visual quality than the corresponding
    controls.', The control samples of these vegetables developed decay or browning.,
  Control green onions were completely rotted., Irradiation reduced the development
    of decay or browning in these fresh-cut samples., It is well known that irradiation
    reduces the population of microorganisms on fresh produce., 'For example, Koorapati
    and others  showed that irradiation at doses above 0.5 kGy prevented microbial-induced
    browning and blotching of sliced mushrooms.', Irradiated iceberg lettuce stored
    in air had a lower score of visual quality than the control., The lower score
    was due to irradiation-induced enzymatic browning., 'When iceberg lettuce was
    stored in MAP, the irradiated sample had better appearance than the control.',
  Texture was expressed by both the maximum shear force and the area under the force-time
    curve., The area under the force-time curve represented the total work required
    to cut through the samples., Neither maximum shear force nor the area of most
    vegetables was consistently affected by irradiation., 'One day after irradiation,
    irradiation at 1 kGy did not significantly  affect texture of any fresh-cut vegetables
    except broccoli, cilantro, and green onions.', The area under the force-time curve
    for the irradiated broccoli was larger than the control while the area for irradiated
    green onions and cilantro was smaller than the corresponding controls., 'After
    14d storage, 1 kGy irradiation did not have any effect on texture of any vegetables
    except cilantro.', The area under the force-time curve for cilantro was lower
    than the irradiated samples., The deterioration in texture in the control cilantro
    was probably due to the decay and senescence of the sample., 'Unlike on day 1,
    irradiated broccoli had similar texture as the control after 14 d storage.', 'The
    control green onions were completely rotted; therefore, no measurements of texture
    could be performed on the control sample.', 'One day after irradiation, irradiated
    samples had similar aroma scores as controls except for iceberg lettuce in MAP,
    broccoli, and tomatoes.', 'Irradiation induced off-odors in the packaged iceberg
    lettuce, tomato, and broccoli.', The off-odors in tomato and iceberg lettuce in
    commercial MAP may be produced from packaging materials because we found that
    irradiated package material without produce produced similar off-odors., 'Therefore,
    not all packaging materials currently used by the fresh-cut industry are suitable
    for irradiation.', New packaging materials containing adjuvants  may be developed
    to eliminate the formation of off-odors., The off-odors in the irradiated broccoli
    had characteristics of sulfur compounds., It has been shown that irradiation induced
    formation of volatile sulfur compounds in other products., It is also known that
    broccoli can produce volatile sulfur compounds under stress conditions such as
    anaerobic atmosphere., The O2 levels in the irradiated broccoli were lower than
    those in the control samples., 'Therefore, the off-odor in the broccoli could
    be due to anaerobic metabolism in the broccoli or due to irradiation-induced volatile
    sulfur compounds from amino acids or proteins, similar to those in meat products.',
  'After 14 d storage, the aroma scores of irradiated carrots, cilantro, green onions,
    parsley, and red leaf lettuce were higher than those of controls, while irradiated
    iceberg lettuce stored in air and tomato had a lower aroma score than the controls.',
  'The lower score in the irradiated iceberg lettuce sample is probably related to
    the low score  in appearance, while volatiles from packages may contribute to
    the off-odors of tomatoes.', 'For the other vegetables, irradiation had no effect
    on the aroma scores.', The lower scores appear to be related to decay or browning.,
  'For example, control green onions, which were completely rotted, had a lower aroma
    score.', 'Similarly, some of the control carrots and cilantro also decayed and
    had low aroma scores.', 'One day after irradiation, there were no significant
    differences in vitamin C content between the irradiated samples and corresponding
    controls for the fresh-cut vegetables except for iceberg lettuce stored in MAP,
    green and red leaf lettuce, and spinach.', 'The losses in vitamin C content of
    the iceberg, green, and red leaf lettuce were 22%, 24%, and 47%, respectively.',
  'After 14-d storage, irradiated green leaf lettuce, iceberg lettuce stored in air,
    red leaf lettuce, spinach, and tomatoes had significantly  lower vitamin C content
    than the corresponding controls.', The losses ranged from 23% for tomato to 53%
    for red leaf lettuce irradiation did not affect the vitamin C content of other
    samples., 'The control green onions were completely rotted, and vitamin C was
    not measured for these samples.', 'Among the vegetables, only irradiated green
    and red lettuce had lower vitamin C contents than controls at both day 1 and day
    14.', 'It is known that ascorbic acid is sensitive to irradiation, converting
    it to dehydroascorbic acid.', 'However, both ascorbic acid and dehydroascorbic
    acid are biologically active.', The loss of vitamin C was observed only in a few
    samples., 'High levels of antioxidants in some samples may quench free radicals
    generated in the samples by irradiation, avoiding the reaction of free radical
    with ascorbic acid and thereby preventing the degradation of ascorbic acid.',
  There was considerable variation in the levels of vitamin C among the vegetables.,
  'For example, broccoli had more than 40 times higher vitamin C content than iceberg
    lettuce.', 'Furthermore, vitamin C content levels generally decreased during storage
    for most vegetables.', The changes in vitamin C content due to storage and variety
    differences may be larger than the losses caused by irradiation., 'In addition,
    ascorbic acid often constitutes a very small portion of the total antioxidants
    in some vegetables.', Our earlier results showed that irradiation did not reduce
    the amount of total antioxidants., 'On the contrary, irradiation increased antioxidant
    capacity of several vegetables, presumably due to increased synthesis of phenolic
    compounds.', 'After 14 d of storage, the scores of some fresh-cut vegetables  fell
    below 5, making those products unmarketable.', 'Nevertheless, many irradiated
    samples had better appearance and aroma scores compared with the nonirradiated
    controls after 14 d of storage, suggesting that irradiation extended the shelf
    life of some vegetables.', 'However, it is unclear how many days of shelf life
    was extended for those vegetables.', More studies with much more sampling frequencies
    may be conducted to find out the exact days of shelf life extension for the specific
    vegetables., 'In addition, a subjective sensory evaluation was conducted in the
    present study using the preset scaling systems.', Consumer or trained panels with
    large numbers of panelists may be employed in future studies to study the consumer
    perception of irradiated fresh-cut produce., 'Our results suggest that most of
    the vegetables examined tolerated a radiation dose of 1 kGy, which appears to
    be in agreement with many previous studies that often focused on certain individual
    quality attributes.', 'For example, it was found that irradiation at 1.0 and 1.5
    kGy reduced the development of decay and off-odor, improved visual quality, and
    preserved the color of green onions.', 'Similarly, irradiation of fresh-cut lettuce
    in modified atmosphere packages at a dose of 1 kGy maintained visual quality,
    while higher doses of irradiation induced electrolyte leakage and soggy appearance.',
  'Furthermore, it was found that 1 kGy irradiation preserved firmness and color of
    sliced mushroom  and physicochemical properties of carrots.', 'Some vegetables
    such as cut Romaine lettuce and diced tomato may suffer a loss in texture at a
    dose of 1 kGy, while some fresh-cut vegetables such as cilantro may tolerate up
    to 2 kGy  or even 3.85 kGy irradiation.', It should be pointed out that there
    are limitations in this study., 'While about half of the fresh-cut vegetables
    were irradiated in the original packaging from a commercial processing facility,
    the nature of packaging materials was unknown.', 'In addition, the commercially
    processed fresh-cut vegetables were irradiated days after processing.', 'Ideally,
    the fresh-cut produce should be irradiated as soon as possible after packaging,
    prior to distribution to retail or whole market.', Fresh-cut produce that is shipped
    to an off-site irradiation facility should be held in an intact cold chain with
    other good handling practices during the 1 to 2 d required for the transshipment
    to avoid possibility of quality loss and microbial growth., It appears that modified
    atmosphere packaging can affect the response of produce to irradiation., 'For
    example, iceberg lettuce packaged in air developed accelerated browning after
    irradiation, while irradiation of samples stored in MAP did not increase tissue
    browning.', 'Our result showed that the appearance, texture, and aroma of most
    of the fresh-cut vegetables examined were not negatively affected by the 1 kGy
    irradiation when stored in air or MAP.', 'The appearance and aroma of many irradiated
    vegetables were better than that of the corresponding controls after 14 d storage,
    probably due to the reduction of decay and browning.', 'However, vitamin C content
    was reduced by irradiation in some vegetables, particularly green and red leaf
    lettuce.', 'Overall, our results demonstrated that most fresh-cut vegetables can
    tolerate 1 kGy irradiation without deterioration in quality.']
