text: ['The 40% ethanol eluent of the fraction of hot-water extract from adzuki beans  adsorbed
    onto DIAION HP-20 resin has many biological activities, for example, antioxidant,
    antitumorigenesis, and intestinal alpha-glucosidase suppressing activities.',
  This study examined the inhibitory effect of EtEx.40 on experimental lung metastasis
    and the invasion of B16-BL6 melanoma cells., EtEx.40 was found significantly to
    reduce the number of tumor colonies., It also inhibited the adhesion and migration
    of B16-BL6 melanoma cells into extracellular matrix components and their invasion
    into reconstituted basement membrane  without affecting cell proliferation in
    vitro., 'These in vivo data suggest that EtEx.40 possesses a strong antimetastatic
    ability, which might be a lead compound in functional food development.']
