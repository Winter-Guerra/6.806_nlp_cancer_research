text: ['We studied the effects of different dietary fats on experimental rat mammary
    lumorigenesis induced by 9,10-dimethyl-1, 2-benzanthracene.', 'Rats were randomly
    placed into four groups fed different diets: a chow diet, and high-fat  diets
    derived from avocado, soybean or olive oils.', The rats were killed 12 weeks after
    treatment with DMBA  and maintenance on these diets., 'The olive diet was associated
    with a significant reduction in the tumorigenic effect of DMBA: tumor incidence
    decreased to 30%, as compared to 44%-55% in the other dietary groups studied.',
  The protective antitumor effect of the olive diet was found to be connected to its
    dietary content of monounsaturated fatty acids such as oleic and palmitic acids
    and with serum concentrations of stearic acid., The promotive tumorigenic effects
    of the other high-fat diets were associated with their high levels of some polyunsaturated
    fatty acids., Malignant mammary tissue exhibited higher values than benign tissue
    for all the argyrophilic-nucleolar-organizer region parameters measured., 'The
    tumor-associated protein p53 was accumulated to high levels in the blood of tumor-bearing
    rats, but not in that of the non tumor-bearing rats.']
