text: ['Tumor hypoxia commonly occurs in solid tumors, and correlates with metastasis.',
  Current cancer therapies are inefficient in curing metastatic disease., 'Herein,
    we examined effect of Thai propolis extract and its major constituent, chrysin,
    on hypoxic survival of 4T1 mouse breast cancer cells in vitro, and investigated
    its underlying mechanism.', 'In vivo effect of chrysin on metastatic progression
    of cancer cells was studied, both as a single agent and in combination with another
    antimetastatic agent, agonistic monoclonal antibody targeting the DR5 TRAIL receptor.',
  'Thai propolis extract and chrysin decreased survival of 4T1 cells after exposure
    to hypoxia, for 2 days.', Immunoblot analysis revealed that chrysin inhibited
    hypoxia-induced STAT3 phosphorylation without affecting HIF-1 protein level.,
  Chrysin also abrogated hypoxia-induced VEGF gene expression as determined by qRT-PCR.,
  'The in vivo effect of chrysin was determined in a spontaneous metastasis mouse
    model of breast cancer, either alone or in combination with DR5 mAb.', Daily oral
    administration of chrysin in Balb/c mice implanted with 4T1 cells significantly
    suppressed growth of lung metastatic colonies., 'Moreover, antimetastatic activity
    of DR5 mAb was enhanced when given in combination with chrysin.', We demonstrate
    that chrysin has potential in controlling metastatic progression., 'Metastasis
    is the spread of cancer in the body, by which cancer cells in the primary tumor
    travel to distant sites, and form metastatic colonies.', 'Most cancer deaths are
    caused by the growth of metastases to form clinically harmful tumors, rather than
    primary tumor growth.', 'Since current cancer therapies are inefficient in eradicating
    metastases, any strategy that can prevent metastatic progression or inhibits the
    growth of metastases in distant sites benefit patients.', An agonistic monoclonal
    antibody  targeting a receptor of endogenous death ligand  can reduce the number
    of metastatic colonies in mouse models., 'However, the effect of combining DR5
    mAb with other antimetastatic natural products has not been investigated.', A
    unique feature of solid tumors is the occurrence of low oxygen levels  in some
    regions within the tumor as it grows., This has received much attention as an
    attractive target for anticancer drug development., 'Clinical studies indicate
    correlation between tumor hypoxia, tumor progression and development of distant
    metastases.', 'The presence of hypoxia is not restricted to the primary tumor,
    but also appears in metastatic sites.', 'Increasing evidence obtained from various
    animal models indicates avascular micrometastases  are hypoxic, while macrometastases  are
    vascularized and not hypoxic.', Tumor-induced angiogenesis is known to contribute
    to metastasis promotion and growth of micrometastases., 'Vascular endothelial
    growth factor  is one of the most potent angiogenic factors, and its production
    is upregulated in hypoxic cells, further inducing angiogenesis in hypoxic tissues.',
  Hypoxic adaptation is mediated by hypoxia-inducible factor -1 which is a heterodimeric
    transcription factor composed of HIF-1 and HIF-1 subunits., 'Although HIF-1 is
    the master regulator of hypoxic response, other signaling pathways including STAT3,
    Akt, ERK, and NF-B, are also activated by hypoxia and participate in hypoxia-induced
    VEGF gene expression.', VEGF also acts as an autocrine survival factor for breast
    cancer cells under hypoxia., 'Moreover, inhibition of VEGF gene expression in
    breast cancer cells can suppress metastasis in a mouse model.', 'Propolis  is
    a resinous material that honeybees collect from various plants, and is a rich
    source of bioactive compounds.', 'Several HIF-1 modulating compounds have been
    isolated from Brazilian green propolis, indicating the potential of propolis as
    a source of hypoxic modulating compounds.', We have isolated a flavonoid chrysin  from
    Thai propolis extract as a major constituent., Chrysin has been shown to possess
    multiple bioactivities., Inhibition of subcutaneous tumor growth by chrysin has
    recently been demonstrated in mouse models of breast cancer and hepatoma., 'Chrysin
    has also been shown to suppress hypoxia-induced VEGF expression in human prostate
    cancer cells in vitro, and abrogates tumor-induced angiogenesis in vivo.', 'However,
    until now, there has been no report on the effect of chrysin on hypoxic survival
    and metastatic progression of cancer cells.', 'In this study, we demonstrate the
    inhibitory effect of chrysin on hypoxic survival of mouse breast cancer cells
    in vitro, and also investigate its mechanism of action.', 'We also studied the
    in vivo effect of chrysin in a spontaneous metastasis model of breast cancer,
    both as a single agent and in combination with DR5 mAb.', Protease inhibitor cocktail
    for use with mammalian cells and tissue extracts was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich.,
  Chrysin was purchased from Alexis Biochemicals., 'Specific inhibitors of STAT3,
    PI3K, ERK, and NF-B  were obtained from Calbiochem.', 'For in vitro experiments,
    test compounds were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide  and kept as a stock solution
    at 20C.', The final concentration of DMSO was kept below 0.2% throughout the study.,
  'Primary antibodies specific to Tubulin, STAT3, Akt, ERK1/2, and p65 NF-B and phosphorylated
    forms of STAT3, Akt, ERK1/2, p65 NF-B  were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology.',
  Primary antibody specific to HIF-1  was obtained from Novus Biologicals., 'Agonistic
    monoclonal antibody targeting mouse DR5 TRAIL receptor  was obtained from the
    Department of Immunology, Juntendo University School of Medicine, Japan.', 'Thai
    propolis was harvested from a hive of Apis mellifera collected in Chiangmai province,
    Thailand, in August 2006\.', 'A voucher specimen  was deposited at the Faculty
    of Pharmacy, Srinakharinwirot University, Nakhon Nayok province, Thailand.', 'Two
    major compounds, chrysin and tectochrysin, were isolated.', Propolis  was extracted
    with methanol  under sonication yielding 517 g extract., 'Part of the extract  was
    fractionated by silica gel column chromatography using dichloromethane, with increasing
    concentration of MeOH, to obtain 16 fractions.', 'Fraction 5  and fraction 8  was
    left overnight to obtain the crystals of tectochrysin  and chrysin, respectively.',
  Their structures were identified by comparison of physical and spectroscopic data
    with authentic standard and the published data., 4T1 murine mammary carcinoma
    cell line was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection., 'Cells were
    cultured in DMEM supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum  and
    antibiotics, and maintained at 37C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2: these
    conditions were used as normoxic condition.', 'For hypoxic condition, the cells
    were incubated at 37C, in a humidified atmosphere of 1% O2 and 5% CO2 maintained
    by a regulated supply of N2 and CO2 gas inside a hypoxic chamber.', Cells were
    seeded into 96-well plates  and left overnight in a CO2 incubator., 'The cells
    were pretreated by adding medium containing test compound to the wells, and incubated
    for 30 min, then the plates were further incubated under hypoxia  for 48 h. Number
    of surviving cells after treatment was determined by crystal violet staining method
    as previously described.', 'Briefly, the cells were washed three times with phosphate
    buffer saline, fixed with 95% ethanol, and stained with crystal violet solution.',
  'After extensive washing by tap water, the stained cells were lysed with 0.1 N HCl
    in MeOH, after which absorbance was determined at 550 nm using a microplate reader.',
  'Assay was performed in triplicate wells, and results were expressed as percent
    survival compared with control.', 'After treatment, cells were rinsed with cold
    PBS, scraped and lysed in RIPA lysis buffer containing phosphatase inhibitors  and
    protease inhibitor cocktail.', 'Cell lysates were fractionated by electrophoresis
    in 7.5% or 10% SDS-PAGE, and electrophoretically transferred to PVDF membrane.',
  'After blocking with BlockAce, the membranes were probed with the indicated primary
    antibodies overnight, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary
    antibodies.', Bands were visualized using WesternBright ECL reagent., RNA extraction
    and first-strand cDNA synthesis were performed as previously described., 'Real-time
    PCR was run on a LightCycler 2.0 Instrument, using QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR Master
    mix.', Sequences of PCR primers were obtained from following references; mouse
    VEGF ; mouse -actin., VEGF primer  5-GAGATGAGCTTCCTACAGCAC-3; and VEGF primer  5-TCACCGCCTTGGCTTGTCAC-3.,
  -actin primer  5-AAG TGT GAC GTT GAC ATC CGT AA-3; and -actin primer  5-TGC CTG
    GGT ACA TGG TGG TA-3., 'PCR reaction was started by an initial activation step
    at 95C for 15 min, followed by 40 cycles comprising denaturation at 94C/15 sec,
    annealing at 55C/30 sec, and extension at 72C/30 sec.', 'Expression level of the
    VEGF gene was normalized to -actin gene, and calculated from crossing point  value
    of the sample, relative gene expression level = 2.', 'The relative change in gene
    expression compared with untreated normoxic cells was expressed as fold change,
    calculated by 2Cp method.', Balb/c mice  were purchased from Sankyo Lab Service
    Co.., Experiments were conducted in accordance with institutional guidelines and
    approval of University of Toyama Animal Experimental Ethics Committee., Cell suspensions  were
    injected into mammary fat pads on day 0., Tumors were measured every other day  using
    a caliper., Daily oral administration  of chrysin suspended in 0.5% carboxymethyl
    cellulose began on day 1 after tumor inoculation., DR5 mAb  was intraperitoneally  injected
    on day 10 and day 14 after tumor inoculation., 'Primary tumors were excised on
    day 18, weighed and fixed in 10% formalin.', 'After sacrificing the mice on day
    32, lungs were collected and fixed in Bouins solution.', Number of metastatic
    colonies on surface of the lungs was counted., 'Size of primary tumors and metastatic
    colonies was measured using a caliper square along the longer axes  and shorter
    axes, and tumor volume was calculated by the following formula; tumor volume  =
    ab2/2.', 'The volume of metastatic colonies was categorized into 3 sizes; small,
    medium, and large.', Metastatic burden was determined from total volume of lung
    metastatic colonies., Data are expressed as mean  SD of 10 mice per group., 'For
    in vitro experiments, data are expressed as mean  SD, and analyzed by Students
    two-tailed t-test to determine the significance of differences between groups.',
  'For in vivo experiments, the significance of differences between groups was analyzed
    by analysis of variance, and the means were compared by using Tukey, with a p-value
    ;0.05 being considered significant.', We first examined the effect of Thai propolis
    extract against hypoxic survival of 4T1 cells., Pretreatment with propolis extract  for
    30 min before exposure to hypoxia  for 2 days decreased hypoxic cell survival
    in a concentration-dependent manner., 'Next, the two major constituents present
    in Thai propolis extract, chrysin and tectochrysin  were examined.', 'Chrysin
    treatment showed a concentration-dependent decrease in hypoxic cell survival,
    with 2874% inhibition observed at 40100 M chrysin, while tectochrysin did not
    show inhibition at the highest soluble concentration.', These results indicate
    that chrysin contributes to the inhibitory effect of Thai propolis extract on
    hypoxic cell survival., 'We further explored effect of chrysin on hypoxia-induced
    activation of multiple cell signaling pathways that contribute to cell survival,
    including HIF-1, STAT3, Akt, ERK, and NF-B.', 4T1 cells were pretreated with 60100
    M chrysin for 30 min before exposure to hypoxia for 624 h. HIF-1 protein stabilization
    and hypoxia-induced phosphorylation of ERK and p65 NF-B were not inhibited by
    chrysin treatment., 'In contrast, hypoxia-induced STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation
    was markedly inhibited by chrysin, in a dose- and time-dependent manner, while
    marginal decrease in Akt phosphorylation was observed only at the highest concentration
    test, suggesting that STAT3 was primary target of chrysin rather than Akt.', 'Specific
    inhibitors of STAT3, PI3K, ERK, and NF-B, were used to evaluate the contribution
    of the signaling pathways on hypoxic survival of 4T1 cells.', 'Pretreatment with
    inhibitors for 30 min before hypoxic exposure for 2 days revealed that hypoxic
    cell survival was inhibited by inhibitors of STAT3, Akt, and NF-B pathways, while
    ERK inhibitor showed marginal effect.', 'These results indicate the important
    role of STAT3, Akt, and NF-B pathways in hypoxic survival of 4T1 cells.', 'Moreover,
    STAT3 inhibitor treatment mimics the effect of chrysin, suggesting that STAT3
    inhibition is the mechanism underlying inhibitory effect of chrysin on hypoxic
    survival of 4T1 cells.', VEGF has been shown to be an autocrine survival factor
    for breast cancer cells under hypoxia., 'We examined the effect of chrysin on
    hypoxia-induced VEGF gene expression in 4T1 cells, in comparison to a STAT3 inhibitor.',
  The cells were pretreated with chrysin  or STAT3 inhibitor  for 30 min before exposure
    to hypoxia for 24 h. qRT-PCR analysis revealed that hypoxia increased VEGF mRNA
    levels in 4T1 cells by 16-fold higher than normoxic cells., 'Chrysin decreased
    VEGF mRNA levels in hypoxic 4T1 cells, similar to that observed with STAT3 inhibitor
    treatment, by 71 and 81% inhibition, respectively, compared with control hypoxic
    cells.', The reduction of VEGF expression by chrysin and STAT3 inhibitor was correlated
    with decrease in STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation levels under hypoxia., 'Taken
    together, the results indicate that STAT3 inhibition is likely to be a mechanism
    of action of chrysin for decreasing hypoxia-induced VEGF expression in 4T1 cells,
    and this might contribute to the effect of chrysin on hypoxic survival.', 'Since
    hypoxia and angiogenesis contribute to tumor progression and metastatic formation,
    chrysin was further studied in 4T1 spontaneous metastasis model.', The experimental
    treatment protocol  did not affect body weight of the mice., The effect of treatments
    was evaluated from both primary tumor growth and metastatic burden., Chrysin  had
    no significant effect on primary tumor growth., 'However, metastatic burden was
    largely decreased by chrysin, in a dose-dependent manner, and significant suppression
    was observed with the highest dose of chrysin treatment.', 'Reduction of metastatic
    burden might result from either decrease in metastatic rate  or metastatic growth,
    or both.', Chrysin tended to decrease metastatic rate but without statistical
    significance., 'Suppressive effect of chrysin on metastatic growth was observed
    by decreased number of medium and large size metastatic colonies, in a dose-dependent
    manner, and significant reduction was clearly observed with large size metastatic
    colonies.', These results reveal the antimetastatic activity of chrysin in vivo
    by inhibiting the growth of metastatic colonies., 'In addition to therapeutic
    effect on primary tumor, DR5 mAb also expresses antimetastatic activity in mouse
    models.', We evaluated the potential of chrysin as an adjuvant for antimetastatic
    activity of DR5 mAb., 'Since 4T1 cells are sensitive to apoptosis induced by DR5
    mAb, low dose treatment of DR5 mAb  was used instead of therapeutic doses  used
    previously, in order to avoid metastasis reduction by massive elimination.', 'DR5
    mAb alone significantly suppressed primary tumor growth as shown by reduction
    in primary tumor size and weight, compared with control.', 'Combination of DR5
    mAb + chrysin  tended to be more suppressive, but no statistical difference between
    DR5 mAb alone and the combination treatment was observed.', 'Antimetastatic activity
    of DR5 mAb was revealed by significant decrease in metastatic burden and metastatic
    rate, and the combination treatment resulted in a significantly greater effect.',
  'DR5 mAb also expressed suppressive effect on metastatic growth, as shown by significant
    decrease in number of large size metastatic colonies, with greater effect being
    observed in combination treatment.', 'Moreover, the effect of DR5 mAb on the number
    of small size metastatic colonies was significantly potentiated when DR5 mAb was
    combined with chrysin.', 'Collectively, the results suggested that chrysin per
    se had a suppressive effect on metastatic growth, and could enhance antimetastatic
    activity of DR5 mAb in combination treatment.', 'In the present study, we demonstrate
    the ability of chrysin to decrease hypoxic survival of cancer cells, by inhibiting
    hypoxia-induced STAT3 activation and VEGF expression.', 'We also provide in vivo
    evidence of the suppressive effect of chrysin on metastatic growth, and a potentiating
    effect of chrysin when combined with another antimetastatic agent, DR5 mAb.',
  'To our knowledge, this is the first study on the antimetastatic effect of chrysin
    in a spontaneous metastasis mouse model.', 'Increased VEGF production has been
    shown to play a role in hypoxic survival of 4T1 cells, and treatment with VEGF
    neutralizing antibody can decrease hypoxic survival rate of cells.', 'Consistent
    with previous studies, our results showed that treatment with either chrysin or
    STAT3 inhibitor, which inhibited hypoxia-induced VEGF expression, could decrease
    hypoxic survival of 4T1 cells.', 'In hypoxic cells, tyrosine phosphorylated STAT3
    forms a complex with HIF-1 at the VEGF promoter, and this complex is important
    for upregulation of VEGF gene expression in hypoxic cells.', 'Our results clearly
    show that chrysin, as well as a STAT3 inhibitor, could abrogate hypoxia-induced
    VEGF gene expression of 4T1 cells, through inhibition of STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation,
    without decreasing HIF-1 protein levels.', 'Chrysin has been shown to decrease
    HIF-1 protein levels in hypoxic DU145 human prostate cancer cells, thus abrogating
    insulin-induced HIF-1 protein stabilization in normoxic DU145 cells, via inhibition
    of Akt phosphorylation.', 'In a previous study, STAT3 signaling was not investigated,
    and the inhibitory effect of chrysin on Akt-modulated HIF-1 protein stability
    was shown only in the insulin-stimulated normoxic cells, but the mechanism was
    not tested in hypoxic cells.', 'In 4T1 cells, the inhibition of hypoxia-induced
    VEGF expression and STAT3 activation by chrysin were observed at a concentration
    lower than that affecting Akt phosphorylation, suggesting that STAT3 was the primary
    target rather than Akt in our model.', 'Additionally, a recent study shows that
    chrysin inhibits STAT3-mediated VEGF expression, which contributes to suppression
    of IL-6-induced angiogenesis by chrysin in human endothelial cells, as well as
    in ovo model.', 'Collectively, evidence indicates that chrysin possesses ability
    to inhibit angiogenesis, at least partly, through inhibiting STAT3-mediated VEGF
    expression.', 'In our metastasis mouse model, daily oral administration of chrysin
    predominantly inhibited metastatic growth, rather than primary tumor growth.',
  'Chrysin has a low oral bioavailability in humans and rats, due to extensive metabolism
    to chrysin sulphate and chrysin glucuronide, and efflux into intestine.', 'Thus,
    the concentration of chrysin within primary tumors might be low, especially during
    early treatment time, when the primary tumor is growing.', 'Another low oral bioavailability
    flavonoid, genistein, also shows a significant suppressive effect on lung metastatic
    burden, while marginally decreasing primary tumor growth at mammary fat pads,
    in breast cancer-harboring mice receiving genistein-supplemented diet, similar
    to that observed in our chrysin treatment.', 'Our results revealed that chrysin
    significantly suppressed metastatic growth, while rate of metastasis  was marginally
    decreased, suggesting that chrysin interfered with growth after the tumor cells
    reached their metastatic sites.', 'Since progression of micrometastases to macrometastases
    requires angiogenesis, blocking VEGF-mediated angiogenesis may suppress metastatic
    growth.', 'This is supported by results showing that treatment with a soluble
    VEGF decoy receptor  leads to decrease in the size of established lung metastases
    of Wilms tumor cells, without changing the number of metastases.', 'In another
    study, liver metastatic growth of colon adenocarcinoma was shown to be suppressed
    by rapamycin treatment, which affects both VEGF production of tumor cells and
    VEGF-response of endothelial cells.', 'Taken together, we suggest that the suppression
    of metastatic growth by chrysin was, at least in part, due to interruption of
    angiogenesis in hypoxic micrometastases, by inhibiting hypoxia-induced STAT3 activation
    and VEGF expression.', 'Control of metastatic growth using hypoxia-selective chemotherapy
    as adjuvant appears to be an effective strategy, since a marked reduction of metastatic
    burden was found in lungs of KHT sarcoma-harboring mice receiving post-radiotherapy
    treatment with a hypoxia-activated cytotoxin NLCQ-1, when hypoxic micrometastases
    were evident in lungs.', 'In our study, combination treatment of chrysin and DR5
    mAb was more effective than each single agent in reducing both metastatic rate
    and metastatic growth, suggesting that chrysin might be useful as an adjuvant
    in controlling metastatic progression.', 'In conclusion, chrysin decreased hypoxic
    survival, inhibited STAT3 activation, and diminished VEGF expression in hypoxic
    cancer cells, leading to abrogation of hypoxia-induced angiogenesis and resulting
    in suppression of metastatic growth.', 'This study also suggests that chrysin
    is a potential chemopreventive as well as an adjuvant agent, that can be used
    in combination with other antimetastatic agents to control metastatic progression
    of tumors.', 'This work was supported by the Thailand Research Fund, TRG5380026,
    a Japanese-Thai Collaborative Scientific Research Fellowship, and a research grant
    from the Chulabhorn Research Institute.', 'We would like to thank Ms. Yue Zhou,
