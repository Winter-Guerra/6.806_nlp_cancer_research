text: ['Two novel tetralone dimers, with an O-bridge, named juglanones A and B, were
    isolated from the AcOEt extract of walnut pericarps.', These compounds are the
    first examples of O-bridged dimeric tetralones., 'Their structures were determined
    by spectroscopic methods, including HR-TOF-MS, and 1D- and 2D-NMR.', Biological
    evaluation of these two isolates against a number of human cancer cell lines is
    also described.]
