text: ['This study examined the influences of domestic processing conditions applied
    by consumers on firmness, colour and amount of phytochemicals and liking and sensory
    attributes intensity rating of carrots.', The aim was to identify a cooking method
    and time that yields carrots with higher amount of -carotene while maintaining
    consumer liking., Instrumentally measured firmness and colour showed comparable
    degradation trends between cooking methods., 'While boiling showed a significant
    decrease in the amount -carotene after 20 min, steaming maintained the amount.',
  Cooking method did not show a significant effect on liking and intensity ratings
    for the majority of the sensory attributes., Medium firm carrots were liked the
    most and low firm carrots the least., 'This study demonstrates that for optimum
    liking, carrots should be in the range of medium firmness.', This can be obtained
    through either cooking methods but steamed carrots possess a higher amount of
    -carotene and maintains liking.]
