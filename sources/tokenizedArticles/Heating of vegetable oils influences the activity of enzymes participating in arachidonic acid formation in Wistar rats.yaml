text: [Dietary intake of lipids and their fatty acids profile influence many aspects
    of health., 'Thermal processing changes the properties of edible oils and can
    also modify their metabolism, e.g.', eicosanoids formation., 'The aim of our study
    was to verify whether the activity of desaturases can be modified by lipids intake,
    especially by the fatty acids content.', 'The experimental diets contained rapeseed
    oil, sunflower oil  and olive oil, both unheated and heated, influences the fatty
    acids composition in serum and the activity of enzymes participating in arachidonic
    acid  formation.', 'The activity of desaturases were determined by measuring the
    amounts of AA formed in vitro, derived from linoleic acid  as determined in liver
    microsomes of Wistar rats.', 'In addition, the indices of 6-desaturase  and 5-desaturase  have
    been determined.', To realize this aim the method of high performance liquid chromatography  has
    been used with UV/VIS detection., 'Diet supplementation with the oils rich in
    polyunsaturated fatty acids affects the fatty acids profile in blood serum and
    the activity of 6\- and 5-desaturases in rat liver microsomes, the above activities
    being dependent on the kind of oil applied.', 'Diet supplementation with heated
    oils has been found to increase the amount of AA produced in hepatic microsomes,
    and in the case of RAP and SUN, it has also increased D6D activity.']
