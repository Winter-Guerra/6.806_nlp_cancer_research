text: [Parsley  was grown in chromium  rich medium under hydroponic conditions to
    explore Cr bioaccumulation in various plant organs., Parsley plants were grown
    under greenhouse conditions in pots containing a Hoagland solution along various
    metal concentrations., Treatments included control  and six doses of Cr as potassium
    dichromate for 15 days., 'In general, Cr accumulation linearly rose in roots,
    stems, and leaves with the increasing Cr concentrations up to 100 mg/L.', 'Beyond
    100 mg/L, bioaccumulation gradually decreased which might be indicative of Cr
    toxicity to parsley.', 'Overall, Cr accumulation in various plant organs was in
    the following order: leaves &gt; roots &gt; stem.', Bioaccumulation factor and
    translocation factor increased as a function of Cr concentrations., 'Owing to
    Cr bioaccumulation in various plant organs especially stem, agronomists need to
    pay special attention to growth medium contamination.', 'In addition, plants may
    serve as useful bioresource to remediate metal polluted sites.']
