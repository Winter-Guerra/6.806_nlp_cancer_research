text: [Soy-based infant formula  can be a substantial source of soy isoflavones during
    early life., 'Because soy isoflavones have the capacity to mimic endogenous estrogen
    and thereby exert hormone-like effects, there is concern regarding reproductive
    health.', 'The objectives were to determine if neonatal exposure to soy isoflavones
    altered reproductive health in females and, if so, whether such effects are transferred
    to subsequent generations.', 'CD-1 mice were bred and F1 mouse offspring were
    cross-fostered at birth and randomized to 1 of 4 treatments: 7 mg soy isoflavoneskg
    body weight1  d1 or corn oil from postnatal d  1 to 10 or from PND 1 to 21.',
  Mice were subsequently bred to control males on PND 56 to obtain F2 females., F1
    mice that received isoflavones had 15% greater body weight during wk 48 and markedly
    reduced fertility with a 5560% success rate., 'Reduced fertility was associated
    with abnormal estrus cycles, fewer corpora lutea in ovaries, and increased incidence
    of hyperplasia and atypia in the uteri.', Offspring  of isoflavone-treated F1
    mice had 15% higher body weight by wk 8 through 16 of age than controls and fertility
    was normal., 'In summary, early exposure to soy isoflavones resulting in serum
    isoflavone concentrations similar to human infants fed SBIF reduced fertility
    in F1 but not F2 mice and increased body weight in both generations of female
    offspring.', Extrapolation of these findings to the human scenario are complex
    but can provide guidance for more fully understanding the implications for infants
    consuming SBIF.]
