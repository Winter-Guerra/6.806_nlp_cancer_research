    Abnormal expression and  activity of many oncogenes and tumor suppressors, such
    as -catenin, C-myc, PTEN, and P53, play critical roles in the development of human
    cancers.1,2 Recent studies suggest that the anticancer ability of several natural
    products may be associated with regulation of these genes.3,4 For instance, metformin,
    which is usually prescribed as an oral antihyperglycemic agent, could reduce risk
    and improve prognosis of certain cancers.5,6 At the molecular level, metformin
    inhibits cancer cell proliferation and migration through repressing the insulin/insulin-like
    growth factor 1  signaling pathway and upregulation of p53 contents.7,8


    Cucurbitacins, which are widely distributed in plants, belong to a class of highly
    oxidized tetracyclic triterpenoids.9 They have attracted much attention for their
    promising anticancer activities, including antiproliferation, cell cycle arrest,
    and induction of apoptosis.10,11 It has been shown that cucurbitacin-B regulates
    immature myeloid cell differentiation and enhances antitumor immunity in patients
    with lung cancer.12 Besides, cucurbitacin-B enhances the radiation sensitivity
    of human breast cancer cells via G2/M cell cycle arrest.13 Moreover, cucurbitacin-D
    increases the proportion in the sub-G0/G1 phases and G2/M phases of the cell cycle,
    resulting in growth inhibition and apoptosis in human endometrial and ovarian
    cancer cells.14


    In the present study, the antiproliferative role and molecular mechanisms of cucurbitacin-E  were
    explored in A549, Hep3B, and SW480 cells.', The results suggest that CuE could
    suppress cancer cells proliferation through attenuation of Wnt/-catenin signaling.,

    abundance of nuclear -catenin, the hallmark of Wnt signaling activation, was examined.',
  'As shown in Figure 2AC, the protein contents of nuclear -catenin were decreased
    in A549, Hep3B, and SW480 cells treated with CuE for 4 hours.', 'Besides, cyclin
    D1 and cyclin E, two downstream target genes of -catenin, were also downregulated
    by CuE treatment.', FIG., '2.', CuE inhibits Wnt/-catenin signaling in cancer

    In the present study, the authors explored the roles and molecular mechanisms
    of CuE in cancer cells.', The antitumor activity of CuE has been documented in
    vitro and in animal models by previous studies., 'It has been shown that CuE impaired
    Arp2/3-dependent actin polymerization and suppressed Src/FAK/Rac1/MMP involved
    pathway, leading to the suppression of cell migration and invasion in breast tumor
    metastasis.17 Therefore, the results of this study add a novel mechanism for the
    antitumor effects of CuE.', 'Hyperactivation of Wnt/-catenin pathway is the common
    hallmark in various human cancer tissues.18 Nuclear retention of -catenin was
    shown to predict a poor outcome and favorable risk indicator.19 In addition, Wnt/-catenin
    pathway is also activated in the cells that are employed in the present study.',
  'Menin, encoded by MEN1 gene, is identified as a tumor suppressor in pituitary tumor,
    parathyroid tumor, adrenocortical carcinoma, insulinoma, and lung carcinoma.20
    Heterozygous germline-inactivating mutation in the MEN1 gene usually results in
    multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1, which is an inherited tumor syndrome that
    includes susceptibility to pancreatic islet tumors.21 At the molecular level,
    Menin could directly interact with -catenin and carry -catenin out of the nucleus
    via nuclearcytoplasmic shuttling in a CRM1-dependent manner.22 Indeed, Menin overexpression
    reduces -catenin nuclear accumulation and represses its transcriptional activity.22
    In agreement, the authors found that CuE could induce Menin expression, by which
    it attenuates the nuclear retention of -catenin.', 'However, the mechanisms of
    upregulation of Menin by CuE remain unclear, which needs to be investigated in
    the future.', 'In summary, the results of this study revealed that CuE exhibits
    direct antiproliferative actions on cancer cells through inhibition of Wnt/-catenin
    activation.', The presented data reinforce the fact that CuE might be a good candidate
    for clinical trial in cancer treatment., 'Navigate ArticleTop of pageAuthor informationABSTRACTIntroductionMaterials
