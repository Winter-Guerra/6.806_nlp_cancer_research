text: ['It has been demonstrated that ganoderma acids suppress growth, angiogenesis
    and invasiveness of highly invasive and metastatic breast cancer cells in vitro
    and vivo.', 'However, the mechanism of action of ganoderma acids in breast cancer
    remains unknown.', 'In the present study, we looked into the effect of ganoderic
    acid Me  on cellular phenotypes and tumor growth in the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer
    cell line.', The results indicated the GA-Me inhibited nuclear factor kappaB  activity
    at 24 h in MDA-MB-231 cells., 'When MDAMB- 231 cells were stimulated with tumor
    necrosis factor-alpha, the inhibitory effects of GA-Me were still maintained.',
  We demonstrated that GA-Me inhibited proliferation and invasion and induced apoptosis
    in MDA-MB-231 cells via suppressing the NF-B activity., 'However, GA-Me did not
    inhibit the phosphorylation and degradation of IkappaB-.', 'GA-Me down-regulated
    the expression of various NF-B-regulated genes including genes involved in cell
    proliferation, anti-apoptosis, invasion  and angiogenesis -6 and -8).', I.P.,
  administration of GA-Me inhibited tumor growth of MDA-MB-231 cells in vivo., 'Our
    results demonstrated that GA-Me inhibited proliferation, angiogenesis, invasion
    and induced apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells via suppressing NF-B activity and the
    expression profile of its downstream genes.', These findings provide evidence
    for a novel role of GA-Me in the prevention and treatment of breast cancer by
    its ability to modulate the NF-B signaling pathway.]
