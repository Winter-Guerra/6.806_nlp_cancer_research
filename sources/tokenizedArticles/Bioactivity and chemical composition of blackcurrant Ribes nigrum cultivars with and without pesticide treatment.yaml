text: ['Eleven blackcurrant cultivars grown with pesticide  and without pesticide
    treatment  were evaluated to compare the differences in plant growth and physical
    condition, total anthocyanin content, ascorbic acid content, total antioxidant
    capacity, effect on prostaglandin E2  production and anticancer cell proliferation
    activities.', Results showed that the yield and growth of PT blackcurrants were
    higher., 'However, PF blackcurrants contained a higher amount of ascorbic acid,
    and displayed an increased inhibition against cancer cells compared to PT blackcurrants,
    indicating that PF blackcurrants have an increased potential to deliver health-promoting
    benefit for consumers.', 'Significant differences were observed between blackcurrant
    cultivars in relation to plant growth and physical condition, total anthocyanin
    content and PGE2 assay, highlighting the importance of cultivar selection.']
