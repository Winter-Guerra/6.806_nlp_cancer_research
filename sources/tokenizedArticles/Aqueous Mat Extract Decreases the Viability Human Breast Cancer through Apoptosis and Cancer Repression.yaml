text: [Mat is a subtropical plant native to South America where this plant is used
    as herbal tea., Several studies have been conducted to elucidate the beneficial
    effects of Yerba Mat tea., A study showed that saponins isolated from Mat extract
    induce apoptosis in human colon cancer cells., Another study indicated that the
    consumption of Mat tea causes higher incidence of esophageal cancer., This study
    aimed to determine the effects of Yerba Mat extract on breast cancer cells., Our
    findings show a decrease in viable T47D breast cancer cells after treatment with
    Mat extract in a concentration-dependent manner., Caspase3-AF647 assay allowed
    the detection of an increase in caspase 3 activity., 'The gene expression of p53
    and caspase 3, two apoptotic markers, were assessed using RT-PCR.', The results
    showed a slight increase in the expression of the p53 gene but no significant
    change in the expression of caspase 3., Further investigation into the effect
    of Mat on the expression of BCl2 is underway.]
