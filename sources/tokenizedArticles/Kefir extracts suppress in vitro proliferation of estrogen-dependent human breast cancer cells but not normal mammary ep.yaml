text: ['Anti-tumorigenic effects have been demonstrated in animal studies from the
    intake of kefir, a traditional fermented milk product believed to originate from
    the Caucasian mountains of Russia.', 'In the present study, the antiproliferative
    effects of extracts of kefir, yogurt, and pasteurized cows milk on human mammary
    cancer cells  and normal human mammary epithelial cells  was investigated at doses
    of 0.31%, 0.63%, 1.25%, 2.5%, 5%, and 10%.', 'After 6 days of culture, extracts
    of kefir-fermented milk depressed MCF-7 cell growth in a dose-dependent manner,
    showing 29% inhibition of proliferation at a concentration as low as 0.63%, whereas
    yogurt extracts began to show dose-dependent antiproliferative effects only at
    the 2.5% dose.', 'Moreover, at the 2.5% dose, kefir extracts decreased the MCF-7
    cell numbers by 56%, while yogurt extracts decreased MCF-7 cell proliferation
    by only 14%.', 'No antiproliferative effects of kefir extracts were observed in
    the HMECs, while the yogurt extracts exerted antiproliferative effects on HMECs
    at the 5% and 10% doses.', Unfermented milk extracts stimulated proliferation
    of MCF-7 cells and HMECs at concentrations above 0.31%., Peptide content and capillary
    electrophoresis analyses showed that kefir-mediated milk fermentation led to an
    increase in peptide concentrations and a change in peptide profiles relative to
    milk or yogurt., 'The present findings suggest that kefir extracts contain constituents
    that specifically inhibit the growth of human breast cancer cells, which might
    eventually be useful in the prevention or treatment of breast cancer.']
