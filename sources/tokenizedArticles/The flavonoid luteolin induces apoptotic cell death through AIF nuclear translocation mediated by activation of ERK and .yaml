text: ['The flavonoid, luteolin, has been shown to have anticancer activity in various
    cancer cells; however, the precise molecular mechanism of its action is not completely
    understood, and studies were conducted to find out how it induces apoptosis in
    breast cancer cells.', Luteolin induced a reduction of viability in a dose- and
    time-dependent manner., The pro-apoptotic effect of luteolin was demonstrated
    by cell cycle measurement and Hoechst 3325 staining., Western blot analysis showed
    that luteolin activates ERK  and p38., 'Pharmacological inhibition or knockdown
    of ERK and p38 protected against luteolin-induced cell death; however, the caspase-3-specific
    inhibitor had no effect.', 'Immunocytochemical examination indicated that luteolin
    induced nuclear translocation of AIF, which was mediated by activation of ERK
    and p38.', Transfection of a vector expressing the miRNA  of AIF prevented luteolin-induced
    apoptosis., The data suggest that luteolin induces a caspase-dependent and -independent
    apoptosis involving AIF nuclear translocation mediated by activation of ERK and
    p38 in breast cancer cells.]
