text: [Breast cancer is a complex disease and may be sub-divided into hormone-responsive  positive)
    and non-hormone-responsive subtypes., 'Some evidence suggests that heterogeneity
    exists in the associations between coffee consumption and breast cancer risk,
    according to different estrogen receptor subtypes.', 'We assessed the association
    between coffee consumption and postmenopausal breast cancer risk in a large population-based
    study, overall, and stratified by ER tumour subtypes.', Odds ratios  and corresponding
    95% confidence intervals  were estimated using the multivariate logistic regression
    models fitted to examine breast cancer risk in a stratified case-control analysis.,
  'Heterogeneity among ER subtypes was evaluated in a case-only analysis, by fitting
    binary logistic regression models, treating ER status as a dependent variable,
    with coffee consumption included as a covariate.', 'In the Swedish study, coffee
    consumption was associated with a modest decrease in overall breast cancer risk
    in the age-adjusted model.', 'In the stratified case-control analyses, a significant
    reduction in the risk of ER-negative breast cancer was observed in heavy coffee
    drinkers  in a multivariate-adjusted model.', The breast cancer risk reduction
    associated with higher coffee consumption was significantly higher for ER-negative
    compared to ER-positive tumours  = 0.004)., A high daily intake of coffee was
    found to be associated with a statistically significant decrease in ER-negative
    breast cancer among postmenopausal women., Coffee is one of the most popular beverages
    in the world., The latest coffee trade statistics estimated that world coffee
    production amounted to 7.4 billion kg in 2009/2010., 'In Sweden, where coffee
    consumption is among the highest in the world, the average coffee consumption
    in 2008 was 8.2 kg per person, with a median of three cups per person per day.',
  'Coffee is interesting in the light of breast cancer etiology because of its complex
    make-up of chemicals, several of which have been shown in experimental studies
    to have cancer risk altering potential through meaningful biological mechanisms.',
  'The scientific community, however, stands divided over toxicity of the beverage.',
  'It has been demonstrated in experimental and clinical studies that coffee, being
    a complex mixture of caffeine and polyphenols, can play a dual role as both a
    carcinogen, in which it inhibits cellular repair of DNA or enhances cell proliferation,
    and a chemo-preventive agent with anti-oxidative and weakly estrogenic properties.',
  'The bulk of previous studies suggest that high coffee consumption is associated
    with a modest reduction of breast cancer risk, although a meta-meta-analysis of
    over 500 papers relating the consumption of coffee to cancer of various sites
    by Arab  reported a null association with breast cancer risk.', Breast cancer
    is a complex disease and may be sub-divided into hormone-responsive  positive)
    and non-hormone-responsive subtypes., Coffee itself might contain compounds that
    differentially affect breast cancer of different ER subtypes., 'We, thus, hypothesize
    that heterogeneity exists between coffee consumption and breast cancer risks for
    ER-positive and ER-negative breast cancers.', 'In this study, we examine the association
    between coffee consumption and postmenopausal breast cancer risk in a large population-based
    study, overall and stratified by hormone receptor status.', 'As the possibility
    that the weak relationship between high levels of coffee consumption and the occurrence
    of breast cancer is due to confounding by related dietary or lifestyle factors
    is tenable, we also adjusted for these factors in our final multivariate models.',
  'Subjects were drawn from a population-based case-control study, which has been
    described in detail previously.', 'The parent study consisted of women aged 50
    to 74 years, born in Sweden and resident there between 1 October 1993 and 31 March
    1995.', An attempt was made to contact all incident cases of invasive breast cancer
    in this population., 'Cases were identified through six Swedish regional cancer
    registries, and written consent to be approached with a mailed questionnaire was
    requested from the women through their physicians.', 'The participation rate,
    amongst 3,979 eligible cases detected, was 84%.', Non-participation was attributed
    to either refusal by the physician  or the patient., Controls were frequency-matched
    to the cases by age., 'Of 4,188 controls who were randomly selected from a continuously
    updated Swedish register, 3,454  gave consent to participate in the study.', 'Exclusions
    were made for women who were pre-menopausal, or with unknown menopausal status,
    or with a previous diagnosis of cancer.', 'The final study group consisted of
    2,818 cases and 3,111 controls.', The ethical review board at the Karolinska Institute
    and the six ethical review boards in other regions of Sweden approved the study.,
  'For the validation analysis, subjects were drawn from the population-based case-control
    MARIE  study which was carried out from August 2002 to September 2005 in two study
    regions in Germany.', Details of the study design can be found in Flesch-Janys
    et al.., 'Briefly, the MARIE study included 3,464 postmenopausal and histologically
    confirmed incident breast cancer cases aged 50 to 74 at diagnosis with primary
    invasive or in situ tumours  10: C50 and D05) and 6,657 controls, frequency matched
    by year of birth and study region.', Two controls per case were randomly selected
    from the lists of residents provided by the population registries., 'For the present
    analysis, in situ cases were excluded.', The study was approved by the ethics
    committees of the University of Heidelberg and the University of Hamburg., All
    study participants gave written informed consent., 'Data were obtained by means
    of an extensive mailed questionnaire requesting detailed information on established
    and possible breast cancer risk factors, including reproductive and menstrual
    history, family history of breast cancer, hormone replacement therapy  and anthropometric
    measures, such as body mass index.', 'Information on lifestyle such as smoking,
    alcohol intake  and physical activity  was also collected from the questionnaire.',
  Highest education level attained was available as a categorical variable., 'Data
    on the consumption of coffee one year prior to interview, specified in cups per
    week, where a cup was equivalent to 1.5 dl, were also collected.', 'Age at menopause
    was defined as the age of the last menstrual period or age at bilateral oophorectomy,
    if one year or more prior to data collection.', The women were considered pre-menopausal
    if menopause occurred less than one year before data collection., 'Women with
    hysterectomy, menses due to HRT or missing information were considered post-menopausal
    if they had reached the 90th percentile of the age of natural menopause, or otherwise
    as unknown.', Subjects classified as post-menopausal in this manner  were assigned
    an age at menopause according to their case/control and current smoking status
    corresponding to the mean age at natural menopause in the respective groups.,
  Information regarding the retrieval of hormone receptor status from the medical
    records of all participants from surgical and oncological units throughout Sweden
    has been presented in detail elsewhere., 'Although ER and PR content of breast
    tumours were routinely measured in Sweden at the time of the study, this was often
    not performed on tumours  1 cm in size due to lack of tumour tissue.', Quantitative
    receptor content was thus only available for 65.4%  of the tumours for both ER
    and PR., 'For the validation study, information on potential risk factors for
    breast cancer was obtained in face-to-face interviews using a standardized questionnaire.',
  Nutritional data were collected using a food frequency questionnaire with 176 food
    items regarding dietary habits in the year prior to date of diagnosis for cases
    and date of food frequency questionnaire completion for controls., The consumption
    of caffeine-containing coffee was calculated in cups per day based on the information
    on both portion size  and frequency., The analysis was limited to women who answered
    both questions on portion size and frequency of caffeine containing coffee consumption.,
  'The final study group comprised 5,395 controls and 2,651 cases.', 'Information
    on tumour characteristics, such as ER and PR status, was obtained from medical
    records.', 'The variable for coffee consumption was categorized as follows: one
    cup or less per day; more than one to three cups/day; more than three to five
    cups/day; five or more cups/day.', These categories were based on the distribution
    within the control group., 'Since very few women abstained from coffee, we combined
    abstainers and low consumers  into a single category.', Women who consumed one
    cup or less of coffee per day served as the reference group for all regression
    analyses., 'Unconditional logistic regression models, adjusting for the matching
    factor, age at enrolment in years, were applied to evaluate if established or
    possible breast cancer risk factors had  significantly different distributions/means  between
    breast cancer cases and controls in this study.', 'The relationships between coffee
    consumption and other breast cancer risk factors were explored in the control
    population by treating coffee consumption as a covariate and using linear regression
    analysis for continuous risk factor variables, age at menopause, BMI  and alcohol
    consumption ), logistic regression analysis, for binary risk factor variables  or
    proportional odds logistic regression, for categorical risk factor variables,
    highest education level, and recent physical activity ).', 'The Wald test was
    used to determine the statistical significance of an overall linear trend for
    the association between coffee consumption, treated as a semi-continuous variable,
    and the breast cancer risk factor in the models fitted.', 'For models for breast
    cancer risk, covariates were considered to be potential confounders if they were
    found to be associated with both coffee consumption and breast cancer risk, and
    caused a shift of &gt; 10% in estimates for any coffee category when added to
    the model.', 'ORs and corresponding 95% CI were estimated for the multivariate
    logistic regression models fitted to examine breast cancer risk, overall, and
    stratified by ER and PR tumour subtypes.', 'Three models were fitted for each
    outcome: adjusted for the matching factor, adjusted for age at enrolment, HRT,
    smoking and education, and adjusted for age at enrolment, HRT, smoking, education
    and daily alcohol consumption.', 'The Wald test was used to determine the statistical
    significance of an overall linear trend for the association between coffee consumption,
    treated as a semi-continuous variable, and the breast cancer risk.', 'Since ER
    and PR status are strongly correlated, we assessed the extent to which coffee
    consumption drives each of the two tumour characteristics, by fitting multinomial
    regression models for five outcomes.', We compared a model without parameter restrictions
    to models with parameters restricted such that coffee consumption was only allowed
    to be associated with one tumour characteristic at a time., 'Likelihood ratio
    tests, with two degrees of freedom, were used to test the null hypothesis that
    associations between coffee consumption and PR status was due only to an association
    with ER or PR status.', 'Associations between coffee consumption and hormone receptor
    status were evaluated in a case-only analysis, by fitting binary logistic regression
    models, treating ER or PR status as dependent variables, with coffee consumption
    included as a covariate.', ORs and corresponding 95% CI were estimated for each
    coffee consumption category., 'P-values representing heterogeneity were obtained
    by performing one degree of freedom trend tests, treating coffee consumption as
    a semi-continuous variable.', 'As there exists prior evidence that certain tumour
    characteristics such as ER status are associated with age at diagnosis, and that
    coffee consumption is significantly associated with age at diagnosis, every model
    fitted in the case-only analysis was also adjusted for age at diagnosis in years.',
  The validation analysis based on the MARIE study population was performed using
    Proc LOGISTIC in SAS version 9.2., The variable on coffee consumption was categorized
    in the same way as in the Swedish study with women who consumed one cup or less
    of coffee per day as the reference group., Unconditional logistic regression models
    were used to estimate ORs and corresponding 95% confidence intervals., 'To test
    for trend, we treated the four categories of cups per day as a continuous scored
    variable in the model statement only.', All statistical computations for the Swedish
    study were performed using R version 2.8., All P-values presented are two-sided
    tests of statistical significance at the 5% level., Table 1 describes the characteristics
    of study subjects in both the Swedish and MARIE study with respect to several
    breast cancer risk factors., 'Age at menarche was weakly but positively associated
    with the disease, a result consistent with the literature.', 'Family history of
    breast cancer, age at menopause, parity, age of first birth, recent BMI, use of
    HRT, alcohol consumption, physical activity and highest education level attained
    were strongly significant for breast cancer risk with effects in a direction consistent
    with those estimated in other epidemiological studies.', Smoking for more than
    one year or more than 100 cigarettes was not found to be associated with breast
    cancer risk in the Swedish study., Table 2 summarizes the relationships between
    coffee consumption and other breast cancer risk factors in controls., 'The variables
    found to be significantly associated with coffee consumption among controls were
    HRT, smoking  and highest education level attained.', Table 2., "Associations
    of coffee consumption and breast cancer risk factors in Swedish study  \n\nTable
    3 shows the multivariate-adjusted OR estimates and corresponding 95% CIs of postmenopausal
    breast cancer for coffee consumption, overall and stratified by breast cancer
    tumour subtype based on ER and PR status, for the Swedish dataset.", 'Results
    were shown for the following models: adjusted by the matching factor, age at enrolment,
    in years  only, and potential confounders ) and average daily alcohol consumption.',
  'A modest decrease in overall breast cancer risk was observed for the models adjusted
    for age only, P = 0.028).', 'When the model was further adjusted for HRT, smoking,
    education and average daily alcohol consumption, the protective effect on overall
    breast cancer risk was no longer found to be statistically significant.', 'In
    the stratified analyses, significant reductions in the risk of ER-negative and
    PR-negative subtypes were observed, with the strongest effect being seen in ER-negative
    subtypes, for all models examined, P = 0.0003).', Table 3., "Results of multivariate
    analysis in Swedish study, overall and stratified by hormone receptor status \n\nWe
    next tested for heterogeneity in the effects of coffee consumption on hormone
    receptor status  in the Swedish study.", The breast cancer risk reduction associated
    with higher coffee consumption was significantly higher for ER-negative compared
    to ER-positive tumours  = 0.004)., 'The effect of coffee consumption was, however,
    not significantly different by PR status  = 0.230).', 'The fitted multinomial
    logistic regression model  without parameter restrictions was not found to perform
    better than the model with coffee consumption effect, restricted to be independent
    of PR status.', 'On the other hand, the unrestricted model performed better than
    the model with coffee consumption effect restricted to be independent of ER status.',
  'Motivated by the trend test results in the ER-negative cancers, we performed a
    validation analysis using the MARIE study.', 'Table 4 shows the corresponding
    multivariate-adjusted OR estimates and corresponding 95% CIs of postmenopausal
    breast cancer for coffee consumption, overall and stratified by breast cancer
    tumour subtype based on ER and PR status, for the validation performed using the
    MARIE study.', 'A modest protective effect of the same scale, but not reaching
    statistical significance, was observed in the MARIE study, P trend = 0.173).',
  'Although the difference in overall effect sizes for different breast cancer subtypes
    were less impressive in the validation dataset, the strongest protective effect
    was similarly observed for the ER-negative subtype, P trend = 0.326), followed
    by the PR-negative subtype, P trend = 0.280).', 'The ORs, corresponding 95% CI,
    and P-values for trend were not altered by the introduction of smoking, alcohol
    consumption and other lifestyle factors.', Our main finding was that coffee consumption
    was associated with a strong reduction in breast cancer risk for the ER-negative
    tumour subtype., 'This effect was independent of HRT, smoking, highest education
    level attained, and average daily alcohol consumption.', 'In the multivariate-adjusted
    Swedish study, women who drank more than five cups of coffee per day were 57%  and
    33%  less likely to get the ER-negative and PR-negative disease, respectively,
    than the reference group.', The effects were also found to be independent of PR
    status., 'Motivated by the trend test results of the ER-negative breast cancer
    subgroup using the Swedish data, we attempted to validate the results in the independent
    MARIE study, conducted in Germany.', 'Though not reaching statistical significance,
    the strongest protective effect from heavy coffee consumption was similarly observed
    for the ER-negative subtype, P = 0.326) in the validation study.', 'We believe
    that, collectively, the results from the two studies in this paper support a protective
    effect of high intakes of coffee against ER-negative breast cancer.', 'The weaker
    associations found within the MARIE study may perhaps be attributed to other factors
    related to coffee drinking, such as brewing method, bean type, and caffeine content.',
  'For example, Nilsson et al.', found potentially relevant chemical differences between
    filtered and boiled coffee., 'While a statistically significant decreased risk
    of breast cancer was observed in women drinking boiled coffee, filtered coffee
    was not found to be associated with the risk of breast cancer.', 'One possible
    explanation of the weaker association with breast cancer risk in the MARIE study
    may thus be due to the primarily use of filtered coffee in Germany, and boiled
    coffee in Scandinavia.', Several other studies have also examined the relationship
    between direct measurements of coffee consumption or related variables and risk
    of ER-positive and ER-negative breast cancers., Some have reported results that
    are in accordance with the findings in this study., 'For example, a study by Larsson
    et al.', observed non-significant trends of increased ER-positive breast cancer
    risk and decreased ER-negative breast cancer risk with increased coffee intake
    per day in an independent Swedish cohort., Ganmaa et al., 'observed a general
    protective effect of caffeine intake on breast cancer risk for both ER subtypes
    in the Nurses Health Study, but the effect was only found to be significant for
    ER-positive breast cancers.', 'On the other hand, caffeine intake was significantly
    associated with a higher risk of ER-negative breast cancer in the Womens Health
    study.', 'Although the results may appear inconsistent, it could be because no
    direct comparisons may be made between the different coffee-related variables
    measured.', 'For instance, caffeine is only one out of the many different compounds
    contained in coffee, and thus caffeine intake is perhaps not a valid substitute
    for measuring the total effects of coffee consumption.', We speculate that coffee
    might contain compounds that differentially affect breast cancer of different
    ER subtypes., 'For example, trigonelline, a phytoestrogen present in coffee extract,
    has been suggested to activate ER through an estrogen-independent mechanism.',
  This compound is biologically active and is capable of stimulating cell growth of
    an ER-positive cell line at low concentrations., 'In addition, coffee has been
    shown to significantly contribute to levels of plasma enterolactone, a different
    phytoestrogen reported to be associated with a significant decrease in ER-negative
    breast cancer risk.', 'The presence of such compounds that specifically aggravate
    the tumourigenesis of ER-positive breast cancer and attenuates the risk of ER-negative
    breast cancer corroborates our finding that coffee consumption decreases breast
    cancer risk overall, but the protection is less evident for the ER-positive subtype.',
  A limitation of our study is that receptor status was available for only 65.4% of
    the Swedish population., 'We have compared the characteristics between breast
    cancer cases with and without ER status, and found no significant difference between
    the two groups, with the exception of age at first birth  and highest education
    level attained.', 'The coffee consumption variable and risk factor data of both
    studies were self-reported, and could thus be subjected to errors in measurement.',
  'However, correlations between data collection via food frequency questionnaires
    and weekly diet records are generally high.', 'Coffee intake also tends to be
    very consistent from day to day over longer periods, and may thus be better recalled,
    thus strengthening the present analysis.', 'In addition, we had limited our analyses
    to coffee consumption of cases and age-matched controls to before breast cancer
    diagnosis of cases to avoid the potential bias due to a change in the dietary
    habits resulting from disease diagnosis.', 'Another concern is the availability
    of different kinds of coffee on the market - caffeinated, decaf, instant and brewed,
    among others.', 'According to the European Coffee Report 2008, decaffeinated coffee
    makes up 8.25% of the total trade of roasted coffee, while consumption of decaffeinated
    coffee in Sweden is negligible: less than 1%.', 'However, the analysis of the
    MARIE study was only limited to caffeinated coffee.', Additional file 1., Table

    hormone receptor status and without., 'Strengths of our study include it being
    a population-based study, its large sample size and detailed information on relevant
    variables: coffee consumption, reproductive and hormonal risk factors, and tumour
    characteristics.', 'We have also obtained supporting evidence in a large, well-described
    and independent population-based study.', 'In conclusion, we found no evidence
    that coffee consumption increases the overall risk of postmenopausal breast cancer.',
  'However, a high daily intake of coffee was found to be associated with a significant
    decrease in ER-negative breast cancer among postmenopausal women.', Future studies
    are needed to confirm the effects of coffee consumption in the light of breast
    cancer subtypes., 'BMI: body mass index; BRCA1: breast cancer 1, early onset;
