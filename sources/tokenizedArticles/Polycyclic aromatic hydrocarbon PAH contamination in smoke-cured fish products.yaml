text: ['In this study, 108 fish samples of smoke cured fish Sardinella aurita  collected
    from 12 major fishing communities along the coastal belt of Ghana were extracted
    with Soxhlet apparatus using dichloromethane, and analyzed for sixteen polycyclic
    aromatic hydrocarbons  using the GC/MS  to determine levels, distribution and
    the characterization of their sources.', The mean total PAHs in the smoked sardines
    from the various communities ranged from 510.59 g/kg to 1461.79 g/kg for all seasons
    with a mean value of 716.84 g/kg., The benzopyrene  had a maximum mean level of
    73.78 g/kg., 'The unit risk of carcinogenic PAHs for benzopyrene, chrysene, dibenzanthracene,
    benzoanthracene, benzofluoranthene, benzofluoranthene, and indenolpyrene associated
    with oral ingestion of smoked sardine was calculated to be 6.1  107 for adults
    and 1.6  107 for children.', There is a significant correlation between the fish
    lipid content and the total PAH levels., The average lipid content of the smoked
    sardine samples collected varied among the various fishing seasons  in Ghana.,
  'A significantly high accumulation of PAHs was found in the smoke-cured fish as
    compared to the non-smoke-cured fish control samples, which showed PAH levels
    that were below detection.', This study highlights the increased danger of consuming
    smoke-cured fish in Ghana as some of the PAHs are known to be carcinogenic., These
    results indicate that there is a need to find alternative ways of curing fish
    other than the traditional smoking process.]
