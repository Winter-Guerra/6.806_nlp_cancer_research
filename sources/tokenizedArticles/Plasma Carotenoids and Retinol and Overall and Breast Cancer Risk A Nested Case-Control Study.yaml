text: ['Experimental studies suggest that carotenoids and retinol may play a role
    in carcinogenesis, but epidemiological evidence is lacking.', 'We investigated
    the prospective associations between plasma concentrations of major carotenoids
    and retinol, and overall and breast cancer risk.', A nested case-control study
    included all first incident cancer cases diagnosed in the SU.VI.MAX cohort between
    1994 and 2002., Baseline plasma concentrations of carotenoids and retinol were
    measured by high-performance liquid chromatography., Conditional logistic regression
    was used to assess odds ratios for an increase of 0.1 mol/L  and 95% confidence
    intervals., Plasma -carotene  and -cryptoxanthin concentrations  were inversely
    associated with overall cancer risk., Plasma -cryptoxanthin concentration was
    inversely associated with breast cancer risk., 'The OR between plasma lycopene
    concentration and overall cancer risk was 1.07, Ptrend = 0.06.', This association
    turned significant  when excluding cancer cases diagnosed during the first year
    of follow-up., 'This prospective study suggests an inverse association between
    plasma concentrations of -cryptoxanthin and both overall and breast cancer risk,
    and an inverse association between -carotene and overall cancer risk.', The direct
    association between lycopene concentration and cancer risk deserves further investigation.]
