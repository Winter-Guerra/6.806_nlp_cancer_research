text: ['Although lycopene, a major carotenoid component of tomatoes, has been suggested
    to attenuate the risk of breast cancer, the underlying preventive mechanism remains
    to be determined.', 'Moreover, it is not known whether there are any differences
    in lycopene activity among different subtypes of human breast cancer cells.',
  'Using ER/PR positive MCF-7, HER2-positive SK-BR-3 and triple-negative MDA-MB-468
    cell lines, we investigated the cellular and molecular mechanism of the anticancer
    activity of lycopene.', Lycopene treatment for 168 consecutive hours exhibited
    a time-dependent and dose-dependent anti-proliferative activity against these
    cell lines by arresting the cell cycle at the G0/G1 phase at physiologically achievable
    concentrations found in human plasma., 'The greatest growth inhibition was observed
    in MDA-MB-468 where the sub-G0/G1 apoptotic population was significantly increased,
    with demonstrable cleavage of PARP.', 'Lycopene induced strong and sustained activation
    of the ERK1/2, with concomitant cyclin D1 suppression and p21 upregulation in
    these three cell lines.', 'In triple negative cells, lycopene inhibited the phosphorylation
    of Akt and its downstream molecule mTOR, followed by subsequent upregulation of
    proapoptotic Bax without affecting anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL.', 'Taken together, these
    data indicate that the predominant anticancer activity of lycopene in MDA-MB-468
    cells suggests a potential role of lycopene for the prevention of triple negative
    breast cancer.', 'Breast cancer is the most common malignancy among women, and
    the leading cause of cancer death worldwide.', 'Presently, breast cancer incidence
    is considerably lower in Asian countries than in Western nations.', 'However,
    breast cancer risk has been increasing in most Asian countries.', 'Breast cancer
    is a heterogeneous disease that is classified into different subtypes based on
    ER, PR and HER2 expression.', Therapeutic options for patients with advanced breast
    cancer are limited and depend on the subtypes of breast cancer., 'Although the
    survival of patients with breast cancer is prolonged by molecular targeted therapy,
    triple-negative breast cancer, a subtype of breast cancer that is clinically negative
    for expression of ER/PR and HER2 protein, is associated with a poor prognosis.',
  'In view of the current situation where no curative therapeutic approaches exist
    for advanced breast cancer, the prevention of breast cancer is of extreme importance.',
  'It is well recognized that breast cancer can largely be prevented by minimizing
    a variety of dietary, hormonal and lifestyle risks.', 'Among a number of dietary
    items, fruit and vegetable intake has been shown to reduce the risk of overall
    breast cancer.', Recent cohort studies have shown that consuming fruit and vegetables
    lowers the risk of ER-negative breast cancer., 'More recently, large pooled analyses
    suggest that high vegetable consumption may be associated with risk of ER-negative
    but not ER-positive breast cancer.', 'Specifically, carotenoids included in fruit
    and vegetables have been suggested to account for the prevention, probably through
    multiple mechanisms, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-proliferative
    and apoptosis-inducing activities.', 'Accordingly, carotenoid intake has been
    shown to be inversely associated with risk of ER-negative but not ER-positive
    breast cancer through a pooled analysis of 18 prospective cohort studies.', 'Moreover,
    women with higher circulating levels of carotenoids have been shown to be at reduced
    risk of overall and ER-negative breast cancer.', 'Lycopene is a major carotenoid
    detected in human plasma, present naturally in greater amounts than beta carotene
    and other dietary carotenoids, and has been suggested to exhibit potential preventive
    activity against several types of human cancers, such as prostate, lung and gastric
    cancers.', 'Similarly, there are several reports suggesting that consumption of
    lycopene may reduce the risk of breast cancer.', 'In animal studies, lycopene
    has been reported to reduce the development of several chemically-induced carcinogenesis
    in rodents, including mammary, colon and lung tumors.', 'Although these preventive
    and anticancer activities of lycopene have been suggested to be mediated by its
    antioxidant capacity, which can reduce DNA damage mediated by reactive oxygen
    species, other potential anticancer mechanisms such as cell cycle arrest and/or
    apoptosis induction have been suggested in endometrial, lung, colon, prostate
    and mammary cancer cells.', 'However, the inhibitory effect and possible molecular
    mechanisms of lycopene, including cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induction, remain
    poorly understood on breast cancer cells.', 'Furthermore, lycopene, although not
    significantly, has been reported to reduce the risk of ER-negative breast cancer.',
  'Therefore, it is interesting to examine whether there are any differences in lycopene
    activity among different subtypes of breast cancer cells.', 'In this study, we
    investigated the cellular and molecular mechanisms of the growth-inhibitory activity
    of lycopene against three human breast cancer cell lines that differ in their
    hormone receptor and HER2 status.', 'The study was performed on three subtypes
    of breast cancer cell lines, including hormone receptor  positive MCF-7, hormone
    receptor negative but HER2-positive SK-BR-3, and triple-negative MDA-MB-468, all
    purchased from the American Type Culture Collection.', The origin of the cell
    lines and their hormone receptor and HER2 status have been described previously.,
  'These cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640  supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 IU/mL
    penicillin and 100 g/mL streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and
    5% CO2 at 37C.', 'All-trans-lycopene  was purchased from Wako, and stored at 80C.',
  A 15-mM solution was freshly prepared with tetrahydroflan   immediately before use
    for the experiments., The final concentration of THF for all experiments and treatments  was
    maintained at ;1.0%., 'These conditions were found to be non-cytotoxic for 168
    h.


    Lycopene was found to form a precipitate when dissolved in culture medium because
    of its hydrophobic property.', 'Therefore, it was removed by centrifugation at
    17 000 g for 10 min.', 'The concentration of lycopene in the medium was measured
    by spectrophotometry after extraction in 2-propnol and n-hexane-dichloromethane,
    as described previously.', 'The residue was redissolved in 500 L methanol : THF  and
    50 L solution was injected into the reverse-phase HPLC system.', The flow rate
    was 0.4 mL/min and lycopene was detected at 452 nm., Lycopene was quantified by
    reference to standard curves., 'The determined concentration of lycopene thus
    obtained in 100 M solution was 4.47 M.


    The anti-proliferative effect of lycopene on these breast cancer cells was assessed
    by WST assay, as described previously.', 'Briefly, 100 L suspension of cells was
    seeded into each well of a 96-well plate  at a density of 2000 cells per well.',
  'This inoculation density was determined by the growth curves so that non-treated
    cells did not reach confluency for up to 7 days, without medium change.', 'After
    overnight incubation, 100 L lycopene solutions at various concentrations were
    added and cells were further cultured up to 168 h. At various times after treatment,
    cell viability was measured using the Premix CCK-8 Cell Proliferation Assay System.',
  The relative number of viable cells was determined by comparing the absorbance of
    the treated cells with the corresponding absorbance of vehicle-treated cells taken
    as 100%., Each experiment was performed using six replicate wells for each lycopene
    concentration and was carried out independently three times., The IC50 value was
    defined as the concentration needed for a 50% reduction., Apoptosis was assessed
    by PARP cleavage detected by western blot using PARP antibody., PARP is a substrate
    for certain caspases activated during the early stages of apoptosis., These proteases
    cleave PARP to fragments of approximately 89 and 24 kD., Detection of the 89-kD
    PARP fragment with anti-PARP thus serves as an early marker of apoptosis., 'At
    various times following treatment with lycopene, floating and trypsinized adherent
    cells were combined, fixed in 70% ethanol and stored at 4C prior to cell cycle
    analysis.', 'After the removal of ethanol by centrifugation, cells were then washed
    with PBS and stained with a solution containing RNase A and propidium iodide.',
  'Cell cycle analyses were performed on a Beckman Coulter Gallios Flow Cytometer
    using the Kaluza version 1.2 software packages, and the extent of apoptosis was
    determined by measuring the sub-G0/G1 population.', Immunoprecipitation and western
    blot analysis were performed as described previously., Equal amounts of proteins
    or immunoprecipitated target proteins were resolved by 4-15% SDS-PAGE  and electrotransferred
    onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane., Non-specific binding sites were blocked
    by incubating the membranes in blocking buffer  at room temperature for 30 min.,
  'The membranes were then incubated with primary antibodies against either phospho-mTOR,
    phospho-p44/42 MAPK, phospho-Akt, Cyclin D1, p21, Bcl-xL or Bax.', The membranes
    were hybridized with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody., Immunoblots
    were developed with the enhanced chemiluminescence system  and were then quantitated
    using LAS-3000 Luminescent Image Analyzer., 'The blots were striped and reprobed
    with primary antibodies against mTOR, MAPK, Akt and -actin.', All primary and
    secondary antibodies except those for p21 and phospho-mTOR were purchased from
    Cell Signaling Technology., 'For reblotting, membranes were incubated in stripping
    buffer  for 30 min at room temperature before washing, blocking and incubating
    with antibody.', Triplicate determinations were made in separate experiments.,
  'To determine the significance of observed differences, the anova was applied to
    the data using statistical software.', The mean values were compared using Dunnetts
    t-test., A P-value &lt; 0.05 was considered significant., 'Lycopene treatment
    for 168 consecutive hours exhibited dose-dependent growth inhibitory activities
    against MCF-7, SK-BR-3 and MDA-MB-468 cells, with the greatest growth inhibition
    observed in MDA-MB-468.', 'MDA-MB-468 cells treated with lycopene for 168 h showed
    significantly lower IC50 value, compared to MCF-7 cells  and SK-BR-3, being threefold
    more sensitive to lycopene than MCF-7 cells.', 'HER2-positive cells were moderately
    sensitive to lycopene, showing the IC50 between those of triple-negative and hormone-receptor
    positive cells.', 'When the exposure time was shortened, IC50 values increased
    and there were no significant differences of lycopene sensitivity between these
    cell lines at 72-h exposure.', These data indicate that a relatively long time  would
    be required for lycopene to exhibit its true anti-proliferative activity for individual
    cell lines., Figure 1\., 'Survival curves for lycopene against MCF-7, SK-BR-3  and
    MDA-MB-468  cells.', 'Cells were treated with various concentrations of lycopene
    for 168 h and assessed for viability by WST-1 assay, as described in the Materials
    and Methods.', The data represent the means from three independent experiments.,
  'Bars, standard deviation.', 'To examine whether the inhibitory effects observed
    in cytotoxicity assays reflect the arrest or delay of cell cycle or apoptotic
    cell death, cells were treated with lycopene at a dose of 50 M, and the cell cycle
    progression and apoptosis were evaluated by FACS analysis.', 'Consecutive treatment
    of lycopene significantly increased the proportion of cells in a G0/G1 phase after
    72 h treatment, with a corresponding decrease in cells in S and G2/M phases regardless
    of subtypes of breast cancer.Upon lycopene treatment, the percentages of the sub-G0/G1
    apoptotic cell population were, although not significant, slightly increased in
    MCF-7 cells, while they were significantly increased up to 13.8% at 120 h in SK-BR-3
    cells.', 'By contrast, when MDA-MB-468 cells were treated with lycopene, the sub-G0/G1
    apoptotic cell population drastically increased up to 35.6% after 72 h exposure,
    with a decline of the sub-G0/G1 population afterwards.', 'The observed decrease
    in apoptotic cell populations after 120-h exposure would be due to early onset
    of apoptosis followed by further cleavages of DNA fragments that might not be
    detected by flow cytometry, because the sub-G0/G1 apoptotic cell population was
    substantially increased to 17.5, 28.5 and 39.4% at 24, 48 and 72 h exposure, respectively.',
  'Therefore, it appears that lycopene-induced growth decline for MDA-MB-468 cells
    would be mediated by the G0/G1 arrest of the cell cycle as well as apoptosis induction.',

    and apoptosis determined by flow cytometry., 'Representative cell-cycle distributions

    also shown as column bars in the right panels of each cell line., Mean  SD of

  P &lt; 0.05., Cleavage of PARP was demonstrated from 24 to 72 h after initiation
    of the treatment in all three cell lines treated with lycopene., 'The densities
    of western blot for PARP cleavage in MCF-7 and SK-BR-3 cells appeared less than
    those of MDA-MB-468 cells, supporting lower incidence of lycopene-induced apoptosis
    in MCF-7 and SK-BR-3 cells.', 'Because activations of signaling molecules such
    as ERK1/2, Akt and mTOR have been considered as major factors contributing toward
    proliferation and survival, we examined the effects of lycopene on expression
    or activation  of these proteins in these three breast cancer cell lines.', 'Upon
    treatment with lycopene, the constitutive activity of ERK1/2 was enhanced 6 h
    after initiation of treatment in these three cell lines, and remained at high
    levels over 24 h. By contrast, the phosphorylation of Akt and its downstream molecule
    mTOR was only inhibited time-dependently in MDA-MB-468 cells but not in MCF-7
    and SK-BR-3 cells.', 'Cyclin D1 functioning as a key regulator of G0/G1 cell cycle
    checkpoint was inhibited with subsequent increase of p21 protein in all cell lines,
    indicating that lycopene arrests the cell cycle at G0/G1 through decrease in cyclin
    D1 expression and concomitant upregulation of p21 regardless of the subtypes of
    breast cancer.', Figure 3\., Effects of lycopene on activations of signaling molecules
    for cell proliferation and survival., Cells were treated with 100 M lycopene for
    indicated times and harvested for western blot analysis., 'Western blots are shown
    for phosphorylated and total ERK1/2, Akt, and mTOR.', Cyclin D1 and p21 are also
    shown., 'Effects of lycopene on the apoptotic and anti-apoptotic proteins, including
    Bax and Bcl-xL.', '-Actin, PARP and cleaved PARP are shown.', 'To clarify the
    apoptotic mechanism induced by lycopene, we examined the expression of anti-apoptotic
    Bcl-xL as well as pro-apoptotic Bax.', 'Upon treatment with 100 M lycopene, expression
    of Bcl-xL did not change in all cell lines.', 'Expression of pro-apoptotic Bax
    protein did not change with the incubation time with lycopene in MCF-7 cells and
    SK-BR-3 cells, but was enhanced in MDA-MB-468 cells.', 'Therefore, enhanced expression
    of Bax would be responsible for the lycopene-induced apoptotic induction in MDA-MB-468
    cells.', 'Both Bcl-xL and Bax appear not to be involved in lycopene-induced apoptosis
    in MCF-7 and SK-BR-3 cells, providing an explanation for the lower levels of apoptosis
    induction in these cells than in MDA-MB-468 cells.', 'In this study, we investigated
    the growth-inhibitory activity of lycopene against three human breast cancer cell
    lines that differ in their hormone receptor and HER2 status.', 'Upon treatment
    with lycopene, a time-dependent and dose-dependent growth-inhibitory activity
    was observed, with the greatest inhibition observed in triple-negative MDA-MB-468
    cells, when cells were treated for 168 consecutive hours, indicating that a relatively
    long incubation time is required to exhibit the actual cytotoxic activity for
    individual cell lines.', This is probably because of the cytostatic nature of
    lycopene that requires a substantial time for the alterations of mRNA or protein
    to exhibit the ultimate cellular death., 'Accordingly, the sub-G0/G1 apoptotic
    fraction became noticeable after lycopene exposure for 72 h  despite that changes
    in protein expression level occurred after 6 or 24 h of exposure.', 'Moreover,
    the dissociation was observed between the initiation of the apoptotic event and
    true cytotoxicity.', 'In this experiment, WST assay was used, which measures the
    level of succinate dehydrogenase activity in the cytoplasm, while the apoptotic
    events were measured by the fluorescent intensity, which reflects nuclear size.',
  'Because it is conceivable that the cells with small nuclear size  may still contain
    a certain level of succinate dehydrogenase activity, these differential methods
    of determination may produce the time lag between apoptotic events and cytotoxicity,
    especially when the compounds show cytostatic but not cytocidal activity.', 'Because
    the actual concentration of lycopene in 100 M lycopene medium was found to be
    4.47 M, the calculated IC50 values were 1.3 M for MCF-7, 1.0 M for SK-BR-3 and
    0.5 M for MDA-MB-468, indicating similar IC50 values of lycopene reported in a
    variety of human cancer cells.', 'The estimated IC50 value shown here for MDA-MB-468
    cells is physiologically achievable concentrations of lycopene, because median
    lycopene levels are frequently found in this range in human plasma.', This suggests
    that regular intake of lycopene may result in plasma levels of lycopene likely
    to affect the growth of triple-negative breast cancer cells., 'Such a physiologically
    attainable concentration of lycopene has been reported to induce apoptosis in
    prostate cancer cells, and several clinical studies have been conducted with some
    clinical benefit.', 'Therefore, clinical evaluation of lycopene is warranted in
    patients with breast cancer.', 'Moreover, in animal studies, lycopene has been
    reported to reduce the development of 7,12-dimethyl-benzanthracene-induced rat
    mammary tumors.', 'These studies, together with the presented data, suggest both
    preventive and therapeutic activities of lycopene against human breast cancer.',
  'To ascertain the preventive role of lycopene, we are currently conducting an animal
    study using an ethyl methanesulphonate-induced rat mammary tumor model, as described
    in a chemoprevention study with genistein.', In epidemiological studies dietary
    lycopene has been suggested to exhibit potential preventive and anticancer activity
    against breast cancer., 'Lycopene has been shown to reduce the risk of overall
    breast cancer more prominently than other carotenoids and to reduce, although
    not significantly, the risk of ER-negative but not ER-positive breast cancer.',
  We have also found that HER2-positive/ER-negative SK-BR-3 cells are moderately sensitive
    to lycopene., 'Therefore, our results support the hypothesis that lycopene is
    potentially useful as a preventive phytochemical for overall and, more specifically,
    ER-negative breast cancer, including HER2-positive and triple-negative breast
    cancer.', 'In ER positive cancer, the estrogen level is likely the most important
    factor and may, therefore, override the preventive effect of lycopene.', 'However,
    the concentration of estradiol was found to be negligible in the culture medium
    containing 10% FBS.', 'Therefore, additional research is needed to identify the
    potential mechanisms accounting for the lower sensitivity of lycopene to hormone
    receptor positive cells.', Cell cycle checkpoints are important control mechanisms
    that ensure the proper execution of cell cycle events., 'Previous studies report
    that lycopene induces a G0/G1 cell cycle arrest, corroborated by the downregulation
    of cyclin D1 and/or upregulation of p27 in human colon, prostate and hormone-dependent
    mammary cancer cells.', 'In the present study, lycopene increased the cell population
    in G0/G1 phase to a similar extent for these three cell lines regardless of hormone
    receptor and HER2 status, and reduced the expression of cyclin D1, which functions
    as a key regulator of the G0/G1 cell cycle checkpoint, with subsequent increase
    of p21 protein.', These data indicate that lycopene arrests the cell cycle at
    G0/G1 through a decrease in cyclin D1 expression and p21 upregulation., A similar
    result has been reported of lycopene inducing cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase
    through reduction of the cyclin D1 level and retention of p27 in hormone-dependent
    MCF-7 and T-47D human breast cancer cell lines when cells were synchronized under
    serum starvation and restimulated with serum addition., 'Our results, together
    with the previous findings, suggest that the arrest of cell cycle at G0/G1 through
    downregulation of cyclin D1 and/or upregulation of p21/p27 might be a universal
    event triggered by lycopene treatment occurring regardless of hormone receptor
    or HER2 status.', The molecular mechanism whereby lycopene arrests the cells in
    the G0/G1 phase remains unclear., 'However, enhancement of constitutive activity
    of ERK1/2 may cause lycopene-induced G0/G1 block.', ERK1/2 is an important subfamily
    of MAPK that control a broad range of cellular activities and physiological processes.,
  'Activation of ERK1/2 generally has proliferative capacity, but under certain conditions,
    ERK1/2 has been shown to have anti-proliferative activity through G1 cell cycle
    arrest.', 'A robust early phase of ERK1/2 signaling followed by a moderate sustained
    phase leads to transient induction of p21 and accumulation of cyclin D1, allowing
    G1 progression.', 'However, robust and prolonged activation of ERK1/2 causes G1
    arrest due to long-term p21 induction and Cdk2 inhibition.', 'In the present study,
    continuous treatment with lycopene enhanced the constitutive activity of ERK1/2
    from 6 h, which remained at high levels with p21 induction over 24 h in these
    three cell lines.', 'Therefore, lycopene-induced strong and sustained activation
    of the ERK pathway may cause a G0/G1 cell cycle blockade in breast cancer cells
    regardless of hormone receptor or HER2 status.', 'We have found for the first
    time that the growth inhibitory activity of lycopene is mediated by differential
    mechanisms of action, depending on hormone receptor and HER2 status.', The apoptosis
    induction was markedly evident in triple-negative cell rather than hormone receptor
    and HER2 positive cells., 'In triple-negative cells, phosphorylation of Akt and
    downstream mTOR were clearly inhibited by lycopene, but not in hormone receptor
    and HER2 positive cells where apoptosis induction by lycopene is not detected
    or extremely low.', 'Akt plays a critical role in controlling survival and apoptosis
    by directly phosphorylating mTOR, thereby inducing signals leading to anti-apoptotic
    pathways.', 'Therefore, these data suggest that lycopene may execute its apoptotic
    effect primarily through blocking Akt/mTOR-mediated signaling pathways in triple-negative
    breast cancer cells.', 'Moreover, lycopene did not affect the expression of anti-apoptotic
    Bcl-xL in all cell lines, while expression of pro-apoptotic Bax protein was enhanced
    only in triple-negative cells.', These data suggest that upregulation of Bax would
    be responsible for the lycopene-induced apoptotic induction in triple-negative
    cells., Lycopene-induced apoptosis has been reported in prostate and colon cancer
    cell lines via suppression of the Akt signaling pathway., 'Recently, lycopene
    has been reported to induce apoptosis in LNCaP prostate cancer cells by decreasing
    phosphorylation of Akt and increasing the Bax:Bcl-2 ratio.', 'Therefore, the present
    study is the first report showing the role of Bax as a potential cause of lycopene-induced
    apoptosis through downregulation of the phosphorylation of Akt and its downstream
    molecule mTOR in triple-negative breast cancer.', 'Although the observations were
    obtained on a single representative cell line derived from three subtypes of human
    breast cancer, our data strongly suggest that the predominant anticancer activity
    of lycopene against triple-negative breast cancer cells could be brought not only
    by an arrest of cell cycle progression at the G0/G1 phase, but by apoptosis induction
    presumably through activation of Bax, thereby supporting the epidemiological evidence
    that suggests a potential role of lycopene in the prevention of this subtype of
    breast cancer.', 'This work was supported by the Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research

  subtypes of human breast cancer cell lines
