text: ['Allyl isothiocyanate  is a dietary component with possible anticancer effects,
    though much information about AITC and cancer has been obtained from cell studies.',
  'To investigate the effect of AITC on DNA integrity in vivo, a crossover study was
    conducted.', 'Adults  consumed AITC, AITC-rich vegetables  or a control treatment
    with a controlled diet for 10 days each.', 'On day 11, volunteers provided blood
    and urine before and after consuming treatments.', Volunteers were characterized
    for genotype for GSTM1 and GSTT1  and XPD., DNA integrity in peripheral blood
    mononuclear cells was assessed by single-cell gel electrophoresis., 'Urine was
    analyzed for 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2-deoxyguanosine  and creatinine.', Ten-day intake
    of neither AITC nor M/C resulted in statistically significant differences in DNA
    strand breaks  or urinary 8-oxodG., 'Both AITC and M/C increased DNA strand breaks
    3 h postconsumption, and this difference disappeared at 6 h. Genotypes for GSTM1,
    GSTT1 and XPD were not associated with treatment effects.', 'In summary, DNA damage
    appeared to be induced in the short term by AITC and AITC-rich products, but that
    damage disappeared quickly, and neither AITC nor AITC-rich products affected DNA
    base excision repair.']
