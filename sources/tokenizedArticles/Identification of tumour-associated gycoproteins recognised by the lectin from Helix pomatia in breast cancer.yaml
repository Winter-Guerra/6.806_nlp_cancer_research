text: [Helix pomatia agglutinin  is a carbohydrate binding protein isolated from the
    Roman snail., 'There has been considerable interest in understanding HPA binding
    partners in cancer, as the lectin has been shown to identify glycosylation changes
    in cancers arising from the epithelia, from patients with poor prognosis.', Identifying
    the HPA binding epitopes associated with a malignant phenotype may be useful for
    prognostication and may also offer potential as targets for immunotherapy., Previous
    studies have shown that HPA recognises a multitude of proteins in colorectal cancer.,
  This study aimed to establish whether HPA recognises the same glycoproteins in breast
    cancer., 'An in vitro model of human breast cancer cell lines was used, ranging
    from HPA negative, non metastatic, to HPA positive and metastatic.', 'Four human
    breast cell lines were chosen to represent phenotypes ranging from normal/benign,
    primary cancer  to metastatic cancer.', HPA binding was assessed using confocal
    microscopy., Membrane proteins were extracted by differential centrifugation and
    the proteins were analysed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  with
    Western blotting., 'The cell surface glycoproteins recognised by HPA were characterised
    using 2-dimensional electrophoresis, Western blotting and mass spectrometry.',
  'HPA binding correlated with integrin ?6 levels, this concurred with previous findings
    in CRC.', 'HPA also bound transcription factors HnRNP H1, HnRNP D-like, HnRNP
    A2/B1 as well as Hsp27, GFAP and ENO1.', 'The recognition of HnRNPs, Hsp 27 and
    ENO1 by HPA correlated with O-GlcNAcylation of these proteins.', 'Interestingly,
    these HPA-binding glycoproteins were either absent or showed decreased levels
    in the non-metastatic breast cancer cell line BT474 and in normal HMT3522.', 'A
    comprehensive analysis of the breast cells proteome showed a number of proteins
    with elevated level in the metastatic breast cancer cell lines T47D and MCF-7,
    but this is the first report to show elevated levels of elongation factor Tu,
    Enoyl Coenzyme A hydratase 1 peroxisomal and macropain subunits.', 'This work
    was extended to analyse the gene expression for UDP-N-acetyl-alpha-D-galactosamine:
    polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase  and alpha 2,6 sialyltransferases  in
    the breast cell lines, but no correlation between the expression levels of mRNA
    of these enzymes and HPA binding was found in this study.', 'The results from
    the present study show that, as in CRC cell lines, integrin ?6 was the most abundant
    HPA binding glycoprotein extracted from the breast cancer cells with a metastatic
    phenotype.', This is the first report in which HPA has been shown to bind O-GlcNAcylated
    transcription factors., This class of proteins represent a new means by which
    HPA differentiates cancer cells with an aggressive metastatic phenotype., 'New
    approaches aimed at targeting these changes might have broad application for the
    treatment of breast, colorectal and possibly other epithelial cancers.', <th>]
