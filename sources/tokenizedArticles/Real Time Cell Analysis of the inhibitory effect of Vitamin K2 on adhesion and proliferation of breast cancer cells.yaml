text: [Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer type worldwide., Continued efforts
    to improve treatment strategies for patients with breast cancer will be instrumental
    in reducing the death rates associated with this disease., 'In particular, the
    triple negative breast cancer  subtype of breast cancer has no targeted therapy
    available so it is essential to continue to work on any potential therapies.',
  'Vitamin K, is known for its essential role in the clotting cascade.', The anti-tumour
    properties of VK derivatives have been reported in both hepatocellular carcinoma
    and glioblastoma., 'Our hypothesis was that menaquinone-4, the most common form
    of VK2 is an effective anti-cancer agent against breast cancer cell types.', 'In
    this study we used a novel impedance-based live cell monitoring platform  to determine
    the effects of VK derivatives on the TNBC cell line, MDA-MB-231 and the HER2+
    breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-453.', Cells were treated with varying concentrations
    of menaquinone-4  previously reported to have an anti-proliferative effect on
    human glioblastoma cells., 'After initial testing, these concentrations were adjusted
    to 100M, 125M and 150M.', 'A significant dose-dependent, growth inhibitory effect
    was found when cells were treated at these concentrations.', These effects were
    seen in both adhesion and proliferation phases and a dramatic reduction in cell
    growth., Additional analysis of MDA-MB-231 cells treated with VK2  in combination
    with a low glucose nutrient media showed a further decrease in adhesion and viability.,
  This is the first study of its kind showing the real-time effects of VK derivatives
    on breast cancer cells and suggests that dietary factors may be an important consideration
    for patients.]
