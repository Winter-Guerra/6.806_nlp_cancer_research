text: [The objective of this study was to evaluate the cytotoxicity and possible signalling
    pathway implicated in -cyanidan-3-ol  induced apoptosis in the human breast adenocarcinoma
    cell line., 'The effects of CD-3 on cell proliferation of MCF-7 cells were evaluated
    by 3--2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide, sulforhodamine B  and lactate dehydrogenase  assays.',
  Cell apoptosis was detected by Hoechst 33258  and acridine orange/ethylene dibromide  staining
    and DNA fragmentation analysis., The expressions of apoptosis-related genes were
    assessed by RT-PCR and ELISA., Our data revealed that CD-3 induced MCF-7 cell
    death in a dose-dependent manner., Marked changes in apoptotic morphology was
    clearly observed after CD-3 treatment., CD-3 induced cell death was considered
    to be apoptotic by observing the typical apoptotic morphological change under
    fluorescent microscopy and DNA fragmentation assays., 'The induction of apoptosis
    is correlated with the increased mRNA expressions of p53, Bax, and caspase-3,
    -7, -8 and -9 and decreased mRNA expressions of bcl-2.', 'Subsequently, CD-3 decreased
    the mRNA expressions of mdm2, p65, c-jun, c-fos in MCF-7 cells.', 'The protein
    levels of p53, Bax, and caspase-3 were increased, whereas, that of p65, c-jun
    and Bcl-2 were decreased in MCF-7 cells on CD-3 treatment.', These results clearly
    demonstrated that CD-3 effectively induced growth inhibition and apoptosis in
    MCF-7 cells.]
