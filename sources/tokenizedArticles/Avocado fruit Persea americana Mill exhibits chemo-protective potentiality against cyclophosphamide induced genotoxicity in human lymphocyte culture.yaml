text: [Diets rich in fruits and vegetables have been associated with reduced risks
    for many types of cancers., 'Avocado  is a widely consumed fruit containing many
    cancer preventing nutrients, vitamins and phytochemicals.', 'Studies have shown
    that phytochemicals extracted from the avocado fruit selectively induce cell cycle
    arrest, inhibit growth, and induce apoptosis in precancerous and cancer cell lines.',
  Our recent studies indicate that phytochemicals extracted with 50% Methanol from
    avocado fruits help in proliferation of human lymphocyte cells and decrease chromosomal
    aberrations induced by cyclophosphamide., 'Among three concentrations, the most
    effective conc.', of extract was 200 mg/Kg Body Wt., 'It decreased significant
    level of numerical and structural aberrations ), and accrocentric associtation
    within D &amp; G group.', These studies suggest that phytochemicals from the avocado
    fruit can be utilized for making active chemoprotective ingredient for lowering
    the side effect of chemotherapy like cyclophosphamide in cancer therapy.]
