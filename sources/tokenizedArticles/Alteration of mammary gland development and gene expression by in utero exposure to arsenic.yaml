text: [Early life exposure to estrogens and estrogen like contaminants in the environment
    is thought to contribute to the early onset of puberty and consequently increases
    the risk of developing breast cancer in the exposed female., The results of this
    study show that in utero exposure to the metalloestrogen arsenite altered mammary
    gland development prior to its effect on puberty onset., 'In the prepubertal gland,
    in utero exposure resulted in an increase in the number of mammosphere-forming
    cells and an increase in branching, epithelial cells, and density.', 'In the postpubertal
    gland, in utero exposure resulted in the overexpression of estrogen receptor-alpha  that
    was due to the increased and altered response of the ER transcripts derived from
    exons O and OT to estradiol.', 'These results suggest that, in addition to advancing
    puberty onset, in utero exposure to arsenite alters the pre- and postpubertal
    development of the mammary gland and possibly, the risk of developing breast cancer.']
