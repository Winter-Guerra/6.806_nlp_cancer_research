text: [Fucoxanthin is a carotenoid present in the chloroplasts of brown seaweeds.,
  'When ingested, it is metabolized mainly to fucoxanthinol in the gastrointestinal
    tract by digestive enzymes.', These compounds have been shown to have many beneficial
    health effects., The present study was designed to evaluate the molecular mechanisms
    of action of fucoxanthin and/or of its metabolite fucoxanthinol against viability
    of estrogen-sensitive MCF-7 and estrogen-resistant MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell
    lines., Fucoxanthin and fucoxanthinol reduced the viability of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231
    cells in dose- and time-dependent manners as a result of increased apoptosis.,
  'Furthermore, fucoxanthinol-induced apoptosis was more potent than that of fucoxanthin
    and correlated, for MDA-MB-231 cells, with inhibitory actions on members of the
    NF-B pathway p65, p50, RelB, and p52.', 'Being overexpressed and regulated by
    NF-B in different types of cancers, the transcription factor SOX9 was also decreased
    at the nuclear level by fucoxanthin and fucoxanthinol in MDA-MB-231.', 'Taken
    together, the current results suggest that fucoxanthinol and fucoxanthin could
    be potentially effective for the treatment and/or prevention of different types
    of cancers, including breast cancer.', Breast cancer is the most common cancer
    diagnosed in women worldwide., 'In the United States alone, it is estimated that
    40,000 women will die of breast cancer and over 208,000 new cases will be diagnosed
    each year.', 'These statistics emphasize the urgent need for improvements in detection,
    diagnosis, and treatment of breast cancer.', 'Several studies have linked diets
    rich in carotenoids with reduced risk of chronic diseases and cancers, including
    breast cancer.', Fucoxanthin  is a naturally occurring brown- or orange-colored
    pigment that belongs to the class of non-provitamin A carotenoids present in the
    chloroplasts of brown seaweeds., 'It is the most abundant of all carotenoids,
    accounting for more than 10 % of the estimated total natural production of carotenoids.',
  It forms a complex with chlorophyllprotein and plays an important role in light
    harvesting and photoprotection for effective light use and upregulation of photosynthesis.,
  Oral administration of Fx does not exhibit toxicity and mutagenicity under experimental
    conditions in mice., 'Carotenoids and Fx, being mostly fat soluble, follow the
    same intestinal absorption path as dietary fat.', 'Ingested Fx is metabolized
    mainly to fucoxanthinol, which is further converted to amarouciaxanthin A in the
    liver, thus the bioactive forms of Fx are Fxol and/or amarouciaxanthin A. Dietary
    Fx is hydrolyzed to Fxol in the gastrointestinal tract by digestive enzymes such
    as lipase and cholesterol esterase and then absorbed into intestinal cells.',
  'Fx and Fxol have been shown to have many beneficial health effects, including anti-mutagenic,
    antidiabetic, antiobesity, anti-inflammatory, and preventive actions on liver,
    breast, prostate, colon, and lung cancers.', Most of these actions involve modulation
    of the nuclear factor kappaB  signaling pathway., 'The transcription factor members
    of the NF-B family found in most cells are p50, p65/RelA, c-Rel, p52, and RelB.',
  'NF-B is regulated by two main pathways: the canonical and noncanonical pathways.',
  'In its resting state, NF-B dimers are secured in the cytoplasm by IB proteins which
    render the NF-B transcription factors inactive.', 'These IB members , , and  contain
    two conserved serine residues that become phosphorylated by IB kinases  upon NF-B
    pathway activation, followed by proteasome-dependent degradation and NF-B transcription
    factors activation.', NF-B members then translocate to the nucleus to form dimers
    likely to have distinct regulatory functions., 'Among the NF-B target genes are
    inflammatory cytokines, anti-apoptotic proteins, and cell cycle regulators that
    promote cancer cells proliferation.', 'Indeed, NF-B is activated by most carcinogens,
    leading to expression of anti-apoptotic gene products which allow survival and
    growth of tumors.', 'It has been shown that p65 and p50 subunits of NF-B are constitutively
    active and are overexpressed in breast cancer, resulting in further transcription
    of anti-apoptotic genes.', The objective of the current research was to determine
    if Fx and/or Fxol have inhibitory effects on viability and on the NF-B signaling
    pathway of breast cancer cell lines., 'Comparative studies have been undertaken
    in two different types of cells, the MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines.', 'Since
    MCF-7 cells inherently express high levels of estrogen receptor - and MDA-MB-231
    express very low, if any, ER- or -, we sought to determine if the presence of
    a functional ER altered the effects of Fx and/or Fxol treatments.', 'Here, we
    report that Fxol has been shown to reduce cell viability, to increase apoptosis,
    and to regulate components of the NF-B pathway in both cell lines from breast
    cancers.', Fucoxanthin  and fucoxanthinol  were purchased from Wako Chemicals.,
  Human breast cancer cell lines MCF-7  and MDA-MB-231  were obtained from the American
    Type Culture Collection., MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were grown in DMEM/F12 medium
    supplemented with 10 % heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum  and 100 U/ml penicillin/streptomycin.,
  Cells were cultured at 37 C and 5 % CO2., The viability of Fx- or Fxol-treated cells
    were measured using CellTiter-Blue cell viability assay  according to manufacturers
    instructions., 'Following dose  and time-dependent  treatments with Fx or Fxol
    of breast cancer cell lines, cell viability was estimated by measuring the amount
    of reduced resorufin by its fluorescence at 560Ex/590Em using a multimode microplate
    reader.', IC50 values were determined from linear regression of fluorescence versus
    concentration and correspond to doses of Fx or Fxol necessary to reduce cell viability
    by 50 % for 12 h of treatment., 'The breast cancer cell lines were treated with
    20 M Fx or Fxol for 12 h, followed by staining with FITC-Annexin V, ethidium homodimer
    III, and Hoechst 33342 according to the manufacturers protocol.', 'Fluorescence
    was assessed using an Axio Observer A1 inverted fluorescence microscope  with
    FITC, rhodamine, and DAPI filters.', Images were merged and analyzed using the
    ImageJ software., 'The breast cancer cell lines were treated with 20 M Fx or Fxol
    for 12 h, followed by protein extractions for nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins,
    using hypertonic buffer with phosphatase inhibitors  and protease inhibitors  as
    described previously.', Protein concentrations of protein extracts were evaluated
    using the Bradford method., Ten micrograms  or 30 g  of protein from each sample
    was separated by SDSpolyacrylamide gels  and electrophoretically transferred onto
    a PVDF membrane., 'Membranes were incubated in blocking solution containing 5
    % nonfat dry milk in TBST buffer  for 1 h at room temperature, followed by incubation
    with a specific primary antibody overnight at 4 C. Specific proteins were detected
    using the following primary antibodies: polyclonal anti-CASPASE 3, polyclonal
    anti-Poly polymerase-1, NF-B family member antibody sampler kit, monoclonal anti-Phospho-NF-B
    p65, monoclonal anti-STAT3, polyclonal anti-STAT5, polyclonal anti-SOX9, monoclonal
    anti--Tubulin, and polyclonal anti-NCL.', 'The membranes were washed three times
    in TBST buffer for 5 min, followed by incubation for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated
    secondary antibody.', The membranes were washed again and developed using an enhanced
    chemiluminescent detection system  according to the manufacturers instructions.,
  Images were taken using the FluorChem IS 8900 imaging system., The Western blotting
    results were referred to NCL  and -Tubulin level  as references., 'Experiments
    for cells viabilities were repeated at least three times, and the data were presented
    as means  S.E.M.', Statistical analysis of the data was performed using Students
    t test and ANOVA with GraphPad Prism., P ; 0.05 was considered significant., We
    first examined the effects of Fx and Fxol on cell viability of human breast cancer
    cell lines MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231., Fx and Fxol significantly decreased cell viability
    in a time- and dose-dependent manner for both cell lines., A two-way ANOVA test
    showed a significant effect of time and dose on cell viability., 'Fxol-induced
    suppression of cell viability was more rapid and more pronounced, compared to
    Fx.', 'Indeed, IC50 values of 121.89 and 39.63 M for Fx and Fxol, respectively,
    were calculated for MCF-7, whereas for MDA-MB-231, IC50 values of 141.54 and 33.59
    M for Fx and Fxol were determined for 12 h of treatment.', 'In addition, these
    results also demonstrate a more efficient inhibitory action of Fxol on cell viability
    of MDA-MB-231, compared to MCF-7, for all times of treatments investigated.',
  Only Fxol had significant inhibitory effects on viability at 12 h with doses of
    30 and 40 M of treatments in both breast cancer cell lines., 'Although giving
    nonsignificant viability reduction, we used the dose of 20 M for 12 h as treatments
    with Fx or Fxol for the remaining of the study to obtain enough cells for protein
    extractions and the study of apoptotic markers by Western blot assays.', Fx and
    Fxol reduce cell viability of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines., 'Exponentially
    growing cells were incubated in the absence or presence of 2040 M of Fx or Fxol,
    for 1248 h, followed by determination of cell viability as described in Material
    and methods.', The results are presented as absolute fluorescence signal and are
    expressed as means  standard error of mean deviation of four independent experiments
    in which each treatment was performed in quadruplicate., "Comparisons to control
    were done using a multiple comparison test \n\nReduction of breast cancer cell
    lines viability in response to Fxol involves increase of apoptotic pathways activities.",
  'In MCF-7 cells, lacking caspase-3 expression, PARP was cleaved in response to 20
    M Fx and Fxol stimulations for 12 h and resulted in cytoplasmic  and nuclear  accumulations
    of the cleaved fragment.', 'For MDA-MB-231 cells, procaspase-3 was cleaved following
    Fxol treatment, whereas PARP cleavage in response to Fx and Fxol treatments resulted
    in nuclear accumulation of the cleaved form  with no cytoplasmic detection.',
  Increased apoptosis of breast cancer cell lines in response to treatments for 12
    h with 20 M Fx or Fxol was also confirmed using fluorescence microscopy., 'For
    both cell lines, Fxol resulted in higher apoptotic levels compared to Fx treatment
    as shown with FITC-Annexin V green fluorescence.', 'However, although a major
    difference was observed between Fx and Fxol on viability reduction of MDA-MB-231
    cells, Fxol treatment resulted in a slightly higher level of apoptosis when compared
    to Fx.', 'In both cell lines, Fx and Fxol treatments did not result in increased
    levels of necrosis as shown with ethidium homodimer III red fluorescence.', 'Thus,
    these changes correspond to increased apoptosis of breast cancer cells in response
    to Fx/Fxol.', Effects of Fx and Fxol on markers of apoptosis in breast cancer
    cell lines., 'MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines were treated with 20 M Fx or Fxol
    for 12 h. Cytoplasmic  and nucleic  proteins were extracted from control and treated
    cells, followed by determination of Caspase 3 and PARP cleavages using Western
    blot analysis as described in Material and methods and use of -Tubulin and Nucleolin  as
    loading controls for cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts, respectively.', 'In c,
    MCF-7 cells  and MDA-MB-231 cells  were stained with Hoechst 33342, FITC-Annexin
    V, and ethidium homodimer III, followed by imaging with an inverted fluorescence
    microscope with total magnifications of 200.', 'The experiments where repeated
    three times


    Since several NF-B target genes are involved in inhibiting apoptosis in breast
    cancer cells, we examined whether Fx and/or Fxol inhibits members of the NF-B
    pathway.', 'In MCF-7 cells, Fxol, but not Fx, increased the nuclear levels of
    p65, p50, cRel, and p52.', 'In addition, the nuclear levels of phosphorylated
    p65 increased in response to Fxol.', 'Since cytoplasmic concentrations of p65,
    p50, and p52 remained constant following Fxol treatments of MCF-7 cells, increased
    nuclear accumulations of these NF-B members might be attributed to increases in
    their protein syntheses.', 'However, decreased cytoplasmic concentrations of cRel
    in response to Fxol in MCF-7 cells suggest that its nuclear accumulation is mainly
    attributed to increased nuclear translocation.', 'In MDA-MB-231 cells, Fxol contributed
    to decreased nuclear levels p65, p50, RelB, p52/p100, and phosphorylated-p65.',
  'In this cell line, decreased nuclear levels of components of the NF-B pathways
    were attributed to decreased synthesis, as shown from cytoplasmic protein extracts.',
  Effects of Fx and Fxol on members of the NF-B pathway., MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell
    lines were treated with 20 M Fx or Fxol for 12 h and cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins
    were extracted from controls and treated cells., The levels of target proteins
    were determined using Western blot analysis as described in Material and methods.,
  '-Tubulin and Nucleolin  were used as loading controls for cytoplasmic and nuclear
    extracts, respectively.', 'Every experiment was repeated three times


    Since SOX9 has been shown to be regulated by NF-B at the transcriptional level
    in other cancer cells, we investigated whether Fx and/or Fxol could influence
    SOX9 expression in breast cancer cell lines.', 'Although no effects on SOX9 could
    be observed in MCF-7 cells, SOX9 expression and nuclear accumulation were decreased
    in response to Fx and Fxol in MDA-MB-231 cells.', SOX9 Western blots from MDA-MB-231
    extracts show the presence of two forms of the protein., 'Such result might be
    attributed to SOX9 phosphorylation, as previously shown by protein kinase A in
    Sertoli-like cells.', 'Therefore, Fx and Fxol treatments might result in loss
    of SOX9 phosphorylation, as seen with the disappearance of the upper band.', Effects
    of Fx and Fxol on SOX9 protein levels and nuclear translocation., MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231
    cell lines were treated with 20 M Fx or Fxol for 12 h and cytoplasmic and nuclear
    proteins were extracted from controls and treated cells., The levels of SOX9 were
    determined using Western blot analysis as described in Material and methods.,
  'Every experiment was repeated three times


    Since deregulation of STAT signaling cascades is associated with cellular proliferation
    and transformation, we investigated whether Fx and/or Fxol could have any effects
    on expression and nuclear localization of members of the STAT family in breast
    cancer cells.', 'Although Fxol had an inhibitory effect on STAT5 protein synthesis
    in MCF-7 cells, no changes in nuclear concentrations for STAT3 and STAT5 in response
    to Fx or Fxol could be observed in MCF-7 and STAT3 did not vary in MDA-MB-231
    nuclear extracts.', 'Unlike others, we were not able to detect STAT5 at the protein
    level in MDA-MB-231 cells.', 'However, Fx alone had an inhibitory effect on cytoplasmic
    accumulation of STAT3 in MDA-MB-231, suggesting that nuclear translocation of
    STAT3 is increased in response to Fx in MDA-MB-231 cells to maintain a constant
    nuclear concentration.', 'Together, these results suggest that inhibitory effects
    of Fx and Fxol on cell viability may be independent of the STAT signaling pathway.',
  Effects of Fx and Fxol on STAT members protein levels and nuclear translocation.,
  MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines were treated with 20 M Fx or Fxol for 12 h and cytoplasmic
    and nuclear proteins were extracted from controls and treated cells., The levels
    of STAT3 and STAT5 proteins were determined using Western blot analysis as described
    in Material and methods., Results for STAT5 in MCF-7 were analyzed for densitometry
    using the ImageJ software  and expressed as a ratio between STAT5 and Tubulin
    followed by normalization to control., 'Every experiment was repeated three times


    In the current study, we demonstrated that Fxol show inhibitory effects on cell
    viability and apoptosis-inducing effects on two human breast cancer cell lines,
    MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231.', 'Furthermore, the apoptosis-inducing activities of Fxol
    were more potent than that of Fx and were correlated, for hormone independent
    MDA-MB-231 cells, to inhibitory actions on members of the NF-B pathway.', 'As
    shown in primary effusion lymphoma cell lines, Fxol-induced suppression of cell
    viability was more pronounced than that of Fx for breast cancer cell lines MCF-7
    and MDA-MB-231.', 'Compared to Fx, Fxol also had a stronger antiproliferative
    effect on PC-3 human prostate cancer cells, MCF-7 and Caco-2 human colon cancer
    cells, thus supporting our current results on breast cancer cells.', 'Indeed,
    Fxol has been shown previously to reduce MCF-7 cells viability by 75 % following
    treatment with 25 M Fxol for 48 h. Differences with our results  may be attributed
    to variations in culture conditions and Fxol concentration, purity, and stability.',
  'Hallmarks of the apoptotic process are cleavages of PARP, an enzyme implicated
    in DNA damage and repair mechanisms, and of Caspase-3, an enzyme activated during
    apoptosis both by extrinsic  and intrinsic  pathways.', 'During apoptosis, PARP
    is cleaved from its precursor having a mass of 116 kDa to yield an 85 kDa fragment.',
  'PARP fragment migrates from the nucleus into the cytoplasm during late stages of
    apoptosis associated with severe nuclear fragmentation, suggesting that apoptosis
    is more advanced in MCF-7 compared to MDA-MB-231 cells treated with Fxol.', 'Others
    have shown that Fx induced Caspase-3, -7, and PARP cleavages and thus triggered
    apoptosis of human leukemia HL-60 and prostate cancer PC-3 cells.', 'Fx and Fxol
    also induced cell cycle arrest in G1 phase and caspase-dependent apoptosis, inhibited
    the activation of NF-B, and downregulated anti-apoptotic proteins in primary effusion
    lymphoma cells.', The present study clearly demonstrated that Fxol induced apoptosis
    of breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 by cleavages of procaspase-3 and PARP.,
  'In support to our results, Fxol isolated from Halocynthia roretzi induced apoptosis
    in human breast cancer cells.', Lack of difference in necrosis levels between
    treatments in breast cancer cells suggests that Fx and Fxol have no effects on
    necrotic pathways., 'Indeed, apoptosis and necrosis are two processes than can
    occur independently, sequentially, or simultaneously.', Presence of necrosis in
    MCF-7 cells may be attributed to suboptimal cell culture conditions., 'Thus, our
    results suggest that reduction of breast cancer cells viability in response to
    Fx and Fxol treatments may be attributed to increased apoptosis.', Estrogen receptors
    play an important role in breast cancer; women with ER-positive tumors have an
    overall better prognosis and are more likely to have their tumors respond to therapy.,
  'However, in up to 25 % of cases, ER-positive tumors are nonresponsive to therapy
    as a result of acquired resistance, possibly linked to constitutive NF-B leading
    to estrogen-independent growth.', 'In this study, we looked at possible differences
    in the inhibitory actions of Fx and/or Fxol on components of the NF-B pathway
    between estrogen-sensitive MCF-7 and estrogen-resistant MDA-MB-231 breast cancer
    cell lines.', 'In lipopolysaccharide -stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages, others
    have shown that Fx inhibited the nuclear translocation of p50 and p65 proteins,
    resulting in lower levels of nuclear transactivation by NF-B transcription factors.',
  'In the present study, major differences were observed in the inhibitory mechanisms
    between Fx and Fxol on the activation of members of the NF-B pathway in breast
    cancer cell lines.', 'Indeed, Fxol treatment decreased nuclear levels p65, p50,
    RelB, and p52/p100 in hormone independent MDA-MB-231 cells.', 'Thus, Fxol treatment
    may contribute to reduce viability of aggressive estrogen-independent tumor growth
    and may involve inhibitions of nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity
    of members of the NF-B pathway.', 'Indeed, other NF-B inhibitors such as celastrol
    and triptolide have been shown to reduce MDA-MB-231 cell viability.', 'Further
    regulation of NF-B members by phosphorylation, acetylation, and coactivator and
    corepressor interactions in response to Fx/Fxol remains to be investigated.',
  'Surprisingly, our results show increased nuclear localization of members of the
    NF-B pathway  in response to Fxol in MCF-7 as opposed to MDA-MB-231 cells.', 'Although
    others have shown that inhibition of NF-B activation in MCF-7 cells results in
    reduced cell viability, our results suggest that decreased MCF-7 cells viability
    in response to Fx/Fxol may be independent of NF-B inhibition.', 'However, the
    balance between the expression of genes involved in the survival and apoptotic
    processes ultimately determines whether the cell undergoes apoptosis in response
    to NF-B.', 'Indeed, treatment of MCF-7 cells with Fxol resulted in increased apoptosis
    despite the fact that NF-B transcription factors were activated, thus suggesting
    that other signaling pathways may be involved.', 'In breast cancer cells, SOX9,
    being regulated by NF-B in other cell types, has been reported mainly in the cytoplasm
    of MDA-MB-231 cells, and was located mostly in the nucleus of MCF-7 cells.', 'We
    showed that nuclear levels of SOX9 were unchanged in MCF-7 cells when stimulated
    with Fx or Fxol, whereas SOX9 was located mainly in the nucleus of MDA-MB-231
    cells.', These differences with the Chakravarty et al., 2011 study may be attributed
    to differences in cell culture and potential cross-reaction of the antibody they
    used against SOX9., 'Interestingly, upregulation of SOX9 in response to retinoic
    acid has also been shown to induce cell growth arrest in breast cancer cells.',
  This is in contrast to our results where treatments with Fx and Fxol resulted in
    decreased nuclear levels of SOX9., 'Indeed, SOX9 may rather be involved in MDA-MB-231
    cells proliferation and downregulation of its phosphorylation may contribute to
    the inhibitory effects of Fx and Fxol on viability of estrogen resistant breast
    cancers.', 'In addition to having crucial roles in mammary gland development,
    STAT3/5 transcription factors also contribute to tumorigenesis when deregulated.',
  'Indeed, constitutive activation of STAT3 has been linked to the growth and survival
    of human breast cancer cells.', Higher concentrations of Fx  than what was used
    in the current study have been shown to inhibit STAT3 expression and phosphorylation
    in sarcoma tissue  and gastric adenocarcinoma cells., 'Although we have shown
    that Fx and Fxol had no effect on nuclear levels of STAT3/5 in breast cancer cells,
    the phosphorylation profiles of these transcription factors may be modulated to
    promote apoptosis.', 'Indeed, decreased phosphorylation of STAT3 is associated
    to reduced invasiveness and survival of breast tumors.', 'In conclusion, Fx and
    Fxol effectively induced cell viability reduction and apoptotic cell death of
    breast cancer cells.', 'Thus, dietary Fx or Fxol could be potentially effective
    for the treatment and/or prevention of different types of cancers, including breast
    cancer.', 'Indeed, most dietary Fx may be converted to Fxol, and Fxol may exert
    a suppressive effect on cancer cells more efficiently than Fx in vivo.', 'However,
    although there is a correlation between increased apoptosis and decreased nuclear
    accumulations of p65, RelB, p50, and p52 in MDA-MB-231 cells, more research will
    be required to clearly establish a regulatory action of Fxol on members of NF-B
    to activate apoptosis.', 'The current work was funded by the Canadian Breast Cancer
    Foundation, the New Brunswick Innovation Foundation, and the Natural Sciences
    and Engineering Research Council  of Canada.', The authors declare that there
    is no conflict of interest that would prejudice there impartiality.]
