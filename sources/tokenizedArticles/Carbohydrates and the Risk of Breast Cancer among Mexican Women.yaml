text: ['OBJECTIVE: High carbohydrate intake has been hypothesized to be a risk factor
    for breast cancer, possibly mediated by elevated levels of free insulin, estrogens,
    and insulin-like growth factor-1.', 'Therefore, we conducted a population-based
    case-control study among a Mexican population characterized by relatively low
    fat and high carbohydrate intakes.', 'METHODS: Women ages 20 to 75 years, identified
    through six hospitals in Mexico City, were interviewed to obtain data relating
    to diet  and breast cancer risk factors.', Controls  were selected from the Mexico
    City population using a national sampling frame., 'RESULTS: Carbohydrate intake
    was positively associated with breast cancer risk.', 'Compared with women in the
    lowest quartile of total carbohydrate intake, the relative risk of breast cancer
    for women in the highest quartile was 2.22, adjusting for total energy and potential
    confounding variables.', This association was present in premenopausal and postmenopausal
    women., 'Among carbohydrate components, the strongest associations were observed
    for sucrose and fructose.', No association was observed with total fat intake.,
  'DISCUSSION: In this population, a high percentage of calories from carbohydrate,
    but not from fat, was associated with increased breast cancer risk.', 'This relation
    deserves to be investigated further, particularly in populations highly susceptible
    to insulin resistance.']
