text: [': Structures of some bioactive phytochemicals in bran extract of the black
    rice cv.', Riceberry that had demonstrated anti-cancer activity in leukemic cell
    line were investigated., 'After saponification with potassium hydroxide, separation
    of the unsaponified fraction by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography  resulted
    in four sub-fractions that had a certain degree of anti-proliferation against
    a mouse leukemic cell line, this being IC50 at 24 h ranging between 2.80467.11
    g/mL.', Further purification of the bioactive substances contained in these four
    sub-fractions was performed by normal-phase HPLC., 'Structural characterization
    by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry  and
    nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy  resulted in, overall, the structures
    of seven phytosterols and four triterpenoids.', 'Four phytosterols, 24-methylene-ergosta-5-en-3-ol,
    24-methylene-ergosta-7-en-3-ol, fucosterol, and gramisterol, along with three
    triterpenoids, cycloeucalenol, lupenone, and lupeol, were found in the two sub-fractions
    that showed strong anti-leukemic cell proliferation.', 'The other sterols and
    triterpenoids were campesterol, stigmasterol, -sitosterol and 24-methylenecycloartanol.',
  'Together with the data from in vitro biological analysis, we suggest that gramisterol
    is a significant anti-cancer lead compound in Riceberry bran extract.', 'Rice
    is consumed by over half the worlds population, the majority of which is in Asia.',
  'Although white rice is more common, there are many special rice cultivars that
    contain pigments, such as black, purple, and red, in their bran, pelea, and lemma,
    and other inside parts, such as pericarp tegment and the aleurone layer.', 'The
    bran part of these pigmented rice cultivars contains acetylated procyanidin, anthocyanins,
    and other phenolics that have significant free radical scavenging activity  apart
    from natural antioxidants, such as tocopherols, tocotrienols, oryzanols, phytosterols,
    and phenolic compounds.', 'It is believed that consumption of pigmented rice improves
    human health because of the rices antiallergic, antimutagenic, and anticarcinogenic
    effects.', 'Therefore, pigmented rice is becoming a valuable source for food supplements
    and nutraceuticals.', 'Thai black rice, cv.', 'Riceberry, has recently been developed
    to provide optimum nutritional benefit to consumers and to be a supplement for
    anemic and diabetes mellitus patients since it contains much iron and little glucose.',
  'The extract of Riceberry bran has recently been reported by our group to have potential
    chemopreventive activity against human cancer cell lines, Caco-2, MCF-7, and HL-60.',
  'This extract also has hypoglycemic, hypolipidemic, antioxidant, and anti-inflammation
    properties.', Riceberry bran oil supplement is also noted to be beneficial to
    oxidative stress and organ histology in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats fed
    with a high fat diet., As a great deal of attention has been paid in studies to
    the structure-activity relationship of phytosterols and triterpenoids in many
    medicinal plants., 'Our current studies intended, therefore, to identify the sterols
    and triterpene alcohols in the unsaponified fraction of the Riceberry extract
    that possessed anticancer activity, which had been reported previously.', 'In
    order to accomplish the necessary purification step, both reversed- and normal-phase
    HPLC were utilized.', 'Additionally, the spectroscopic data useful for structural
    identification were obtained by NMR with the aid of combined chromatographic-mass
    spectrometric techniques.', 'Thai black non-glutinous rice, cv.', 'Riceberry,
    was used in this study.', 'This rice was grown in an experimental field in Kasetsart
    University, Nakorn Pathom province, in central Thailand in 2011.', The harvested
    paddy was dried by modified hot air at a temperature of 40 C until their moisture
    content was reduced to approximately 14% by weight., 'The rice was then stored
    in a controlled room at 15 C. On the day of the experiment, the paddy was dehusked
    and milled in a local milling system  for 30 s to obtain approximately 10%  fresh
    rice bran.', The bran was sieved through a 750-lm Endecotts test sieve  prior
    to further experiments., 'Solvents, mainly methanol, dichloromethane, and hexane,
    used for extraction of chemical components from the Riceberry bran were analytical
    grade and were obtained from Fluka.', HPLC grade methanol and hexane and absolute
    ethanol were purchased from Merck., De-ionized water was obtained from a Milli-Q
    UV-Plus water purification system., One kilogram of the black rice bran was extracted
    using hexane followed by dichloromethane., The Riceberry bran dichloromethane
    extract  was evaporated to dryness yielding 45.9 g of crude extract., 'The extract
    was then saponified with 0.5 M ethanolic KOH solution by refluxing at 70 C for
    2 h. After evaporation to dryness, the residue was dissolved in 50 mL of distilled
    water and partitioned twice with dichloromethane.', These two dichloromethane
    phases were combined and concentrated to give the Riceberry bran dichloromethane
    extract after saponification., Fractionation of the RBDS was done using a HPLC
    system., 'The RBDS was subjected to separation by reversed-phase HPLC on a semi-preparative
    Vertisep C18 column, at 25 C with the DAD detector at wavelength 210 nm.', Its
    components were eluted by 100% methanol at a flow rate of 2 mL/min., 'This yielded
    four sub-fractions, RBDS1-RBDS4, each of which contained a mixture of phytosterols
    and triterpenoids.', These sub-fractions were subjected to further purification
    by normal-phase HPLC on a Vertisep UPS silica column  with 1% ethanol in hexane
    as the mobile phase., GC-MS analysis was done with a fused silica AT-5MS capillary
    column  equipped on a gas chromatography -Agilent 6890 gas chromatograph-mass
    spectrometer that had an HP 5973 mass-selective detector., 'Its split ratio of
    injection was 20:1.', The injection port temperature was 250 C. The column temperature
    program was started at 60 C upon injection., The temperature was increased at
    a rate of 3 C /min to 280 C and held for 30 min., Purified helium at a flow rate
    of 1 mL/min was used as the GC carrier gas., 'The mass spectrometer was operated
    in electron impact mode: electron energy 70 eV; ion source temperature 230 C;
    quadrupole temperature 150 C; mass range  29550; scan rate 6.35 scan/s; EM voltage
    1341 V. The GC-MS transfer line was set to 280 C. Identification of the separated
    components was performed by matching their mass spectra with reference spectra
    compiled in the W8N08 and Wiley7n mass spectral libraries.', 'To determine individual
    sterol and triterpenoid components in the crude rice bran extract, unsaponified
    fraction, and its four sub-fractions, a linear calibration curve of -sitosterol
    obtained with a correlation coefficient of R2 = 0.9998 over the concentration
    range of 10400 g/mL was used.', Peak areas of all detected sterols and triterpenoids
    were measured as the areas under peaks in the GC-MS chromatograms., Concentrations
    of each component detected were calculated based on equivalence with -sitosterol.,
  The liquid chromatography-atmospheric pressure chemical ionization-mass spectrometry  was
    operated in positive mode., 'The optimized atmospheric pressure chemical ionization-mass
    spectrometry  parameters were: fragmentor voltage 120 V, capillary voltage 4500
    V, drying gas temperature 330 C, drying gas flow rate 5 L/min, nebulizer pressure
    25 psi, and vaporizer temperature 350 C.


    Pure sterol and triterpenoid components were characterized by elucidating 1H and
    13C-nuclear magnetic resonance spectra.', The chemical shifts were in ppm and
    coupling constants in Hz., 'Abbreviations used for multiplicity were s = singlet,
    d = doublet, t = triplet, dt = doublet of triplet, dd = double of doublet and
    m = multiplet.', 'The dept 135, dept 90, and heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence  was
    done to confirm the carbon multiplicity and carbon positions correlated to protons.',
  'Cancer blood cells  obtained from ATCC  were plated onto 75 cm2 cell culture flasks
    and grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 1% penicillin-streptomycin, 1% glutamine
    and 10% fetal bovine serum, at 37 C under a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere.', Two
    hundred thousand cells were seeded onto 96-well-plates with 100 L of medium per
    well and incubated for 24 h to sub-confluence., 'Following this, the cells were
    treated with sub-fractions of RBDS dissolved in absolute ethanol at concentrations
    ranging from 12.5 to 1000 g/mL for both 24 and 48 h. Absolute ethanol was used
    to treat cells in the vehicle controls.', 'After incubation, the supernatant was
    discarded and 100 L of medium containing 10 L of 3--2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide  solution  was
    added and further incubated at 37 C for 4 h. The supernatant was replaced with
    100 L of MTT solubilizing solution.', The purple formazan product was measured
    by spectrophotometer at 570 nm with a reference wavelength at 690 nm., All experiments
    were performed in triplicate., 'The percentage of cell viability was statistically
    analyzed using one-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey post hoc test and expressed as
    mean  S.E.M.', The significant difference between groups was considered at p ;
    0.05., 'Phytosterol and triterpenoid components in all Riceberry bran extract
    and fractions, crude dichloromethane  and the unsaponified dichloromethane fraction  and
    its four sub-fractions, were separated and tentatively identified using a capillary
    GC-MS.', The quantities of these sterols and triterpenoids in the rice bran extract
    and its fractions are shown in Table 1., 'Four compounds were examined in the
    crude dichloromethane: three sterols, -sitosterol, campesterol, and stigmasterol,
    and one triterpenoid, 24-methylenecycloartanol.', 'Whereas four sterols, -sitosterol,
    campesterol, gramisterol, and stigmasterol, and two triterpinoids, 24-methylenecycloartanol
    and cycloeucalenol, were identified in the RBDS fraction.', The addition of these
    sterol and triterpenoid components was could be resulted from the elimination
    of triglyceride and fatty acid matrix by saponification., 'Another reason was
    probably due to hydrolysis of ester bond of oryzanols, steryl fatty acyl esters,
    and hydroxycinnamate steryl esters.', 'RBDS was fractioned by reversed-phase-HPLC
    into four fractions, RBDS1, RBDS2, RBDS3, and RBDS4.', 'RBDS1 contained a mixture
    of two sterols, 24-methylene-ergosta-5-en-3-ol and 24-methylene-ergosta-7-en-3-ol,.',
  'RBDS2 was derived from the combination of two sterols and three triterpenoids,
    gramisterol, fucosterol, cycloeucalenol, lupeol, and lupenone,.', 'RBDS3 was the
    product of two sterols, campesterol and stigmasterol,  while RBDS4 was a mixture
    of -sitosterol and a triterpenoid, 24-methylenecycloartanol,.', Purification of
    RBDS4 yielded -sitosterol and 24-methylenecycloartanol., 'Five additional structures
    of sterols and triterpenes, 24-methylene-ergosta-5-en-3-ol, 24-methylene-ergosta-7-en-3-ol,
    fucosterol, lupeol, and lupenone, were confirmed.', The most abundant compounds
    among these rice bran fractions were 24-methylenecycloartanol and -sitosterol.,
  Sterols and triterpene alcohols in the RBDS1-RBDS4 sub-fractions of the Riceberry
    extract were firstly identified by comparing their mass spectra with literature
    data of pure compounds., Further separation of some components was done by using
    normal-phase HPLC to obtain pure compounds., 'Following this, the 1H and 13C-NMR
    were done to confirm the carbon multiplicity.', The carbon positions were then
    correlated to protons., 'Nine sterol and triterpenoid compounds, 24-methylene-ergosta-5-en-3-ol,
    fucosterol, campesterol, stigmasterol, -sitosterol, cycloeucalenol, lupenone,
    lupeol, and 24-methylenecycloartanol, were tentatively identified by GC-MS. Two
    sterols, 24-methylene-ergosta-7-en-3-ol and gramisterol, were characterized by
    comparing their 1H and 13C NMR spectra with literature data.', The molecular ion
    peak of 24-methylene-ergosta-7-en-3-ol was at m/z 398 in its EI mass spectrum
    and the molecular formula of C28H46O was investigated for the compound., Gramisterol
    had an EI spectrum that possessed molecular ion at m/z 412 and the molecular formula
    of C29H48O., 'This sterols spectrum showed fragment ions at m/z 379 +, 379 +,
    328 +, 285 +, and 269 +, all of which confirmed its chemical structure.', 'The
    molecular weights of all sterols and triterpenoids were also confirmed by their
    pseudomolecular ions: +.', This confirmation resulted from normal-phase LC-MS
    operated in APCI mode., 'It is to be noted that the protonated molecular ions
    + of 24-methylene-ergosta-7-en-3-ol, cycloeucalenol, and 24-methylenecycloartanol  were
    very abundant.', The 1H and 13C NMR of 24-methylene-ergosta-5-en-3-ol also had
    singlet signals of olefinic methylene protons at  4.65 and 4.71 ppm and a doublet
    signal of olefinic methine proton at  5.35 ppm., 'The carbon signals at  105.93,
    121.72, and 140.77 ppm supported the two double bonds.', The closely related structures
    of 24-methylene-ergosta-7-en-3-ol and 24-methylene-ergosta-5-en-3-ol were differentiated
    by a double bond in the cyclohexane ring., The different olefinic methine proton
    appeared as a doublet signal at  5.15 ppm and was related to the carbon signal
    at  120.00 ppm., Fucosterol had two double bonds similar to those of 24-methylene-ergosta-5-en-3-ol
    but it had a methyl group instead of one olefinic methylene proton at a side chain.,
  'Thus, the additional methyl group and olefinic methine proton signals were doublet
    and quartet at  1.57 and 5.18 ppm, respectively.', The 13C-NMR spectral data of
    fucosterol showed both carbons at  13.05 and 116.46 ppm., Gramisterol had a methyl
    group instead of a methylene proton of 24-methylene-ergosta-7-en-3-ol at position
    four., The additional methyl group proton signal was a doublet at  0.95 ppm and
    was related to the methyl carbon signal at  15.15 ppm., Campesterol was related
    to 24-methylene-ergosta-5-en-3-ol and had only one double bond in the cyclohexane
    ring., The doublet signal of olefinic methine proton occurred at  5.33 ppm and
    was related to the carbon signal at  121.72 ppm., '1H-NMR spectral data of stigmasterol
    had three olefinic methine proton signals of two double bonds at  5.33, 5.15,
    and 5.00 ppm and they were related to four olefinic carbon signals at  121.72,
    129.29, 138.32, and 140.77 ppm.', The structure of -sitosterol is similar to stigmasterol
    but it has a saturated side chain that has only one double bond in the cyclohexane
    ring., 'Thus, one olefinic proton doublet signal at  5.35 ppm was related to the
    carbon signal at  121.72 ppm.', The structure of cycloeucalenol has cyclopropane
    joined to cyclohexane at positions nine and ten., The methylene protons of cyclopropane
    occurred as two doublet signals at  0.15 and 0.38 ppm., 'There are two methyl
    groups in 24-methylenecycloartanol at position four of cyclohexane, while cycloeucalenol
    has only one methyl group at position four.', 'Thus, seven methyl proton signals
    at  0.81, 0.89, 0.90, 0.97, 1.02, and 1.04 ppm were shown in 1H-NMR spectral data
    of 24-methylenecycloartanol, which were related to seven carbon signals at  14.15,
    18.04, 18.32, 19.33, 21.88, 22.01, and 25.24 ppm.', The methylene protons of cyclopropane
    occurred as two doublet signals at  0.33 and 0.55 ppm., The olefinic methylene
    protons occurred as two singlet signals at  4.66 and 4.71 ppm and were related
    to carbon signals at  105.94 ppm., The structures and data of these black rice
    sterols and triterpenoids are summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2 and Table 3.,

    extract of black rice bran cv., Riceberry., Figure 1., The structures of sterol
    and triterpenoid compounds obtained from the extract of black rice bran cv., Riceberry.,
  All four sub-fractions of the RBDS showed time-dependent and concentration-dependent
    anti-proliferation against mouse leukemic cell line., The in vitro effectiveness
    of the RBDS1-4 sub-fractions against this cancer cell is indicated by the concentrations
    that inhibited 50% of cell growth  shown in Table 4., The IC50 of these RBDS sub-fractions
    determined at 24 h ranged from 2.80 to 467.11 g/mL., RBDS1 and RBDS2 sub-fractions
    exhibited stronger anti-proliferation of cancer cell than did sub-fractions RBDS3
    and RBDS4., Figure 2., Effect of  RBDS1;  RBDS2;  RBDS3; and  RBDS4 on cell viability
    analyzed using MTT assay., Figure 2., Effect of  RBDS1;  RBDS2;  RBDS3; and  RBDS4
    on cell viability analyzed using MTT assay., 'The RBD crude extract analyzed by
    GC-MS gave the detection of only four major phytosterols; campesterol, stigmasterol,
    -sitosterol, and 24-methylenecycloartanol, which was due to the high complexity
    of sample matrices.', 'These four phytosterols, along with gramisterol and cycloeucalenol,
    were also found in RBDS.', The higher numbers of free sterols and triterpene alcohols
    in the RBDS indicate the important role of these phytochemicals in enabling higher
    biological performance., 'However, the relatively highest amount of 24-methylenecycloartanol
    contained in the RBDS only partially played a role in anti-proliferation of WEHI-3
    cells.', This was confirmed by approximately the same amount of 24-methylenecycloartanol
    in RBDS4 sub-fraction having weaker anti-proliferation than that of the other
    RBDS sub-fractions., 'Previously, 24-methylenecycloartanol had shown many biological
    activities, such as arousal effect, strongly active against 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate
    -induced inflammation, and cytotoxicity against HeLa as well as WI-38 and Mel-43
    cancer cells.', '-Sitosterol, the second abundant compound in RBDS presented as
    a free sterol, has several known biological activities: reduction of blood cholesterol,
    anti-inflammation, cytotoxic against Hela, Caski, MCF-7, and A546 cancer cells,
    and anti-diabetic and anti-peroxidation.', This phytosterol was found to partially
    play a role in anti-WEHI-3 cell proliferation because it exerted weaker anti-proliferation
    at higher concentration in the RBDS4 sub-fraction with 24-methylenecycloartanol
    compared to the other sub-fractions., 'The other compounds that promoted WEHI-3
    cell anti-proliferation activity were gramisterol, campesterol, stigmasterol,
    and cycloeucalenol.', 'Campesterol and stigmasterol had been probed in rice bran
    oil in the form of free alcohol and steryl ferrulate, which exhibited anti-inflammatory
    effect and cytotoxic against some cancer cell lines.', 'Both compounds occurred
    in RBDS3 sub-fraction, which presented relatively lower anti-proliferation against
    WEHI-3 cell.', 'A triterpenoid, cycloeucalenol, occurred in a small amount and,
    thus, may play significant role in the RBDS or in the RBDS2 sub-fraction.', 'RBDS1
    sub-fraction had the second most active anti-WEHI-3 cancer cell proliferation,
    presumably because of its 24-methylene-ergosta-5-en-3-ol and 24-methylene-ergosta-7-en-3-ol
    sterols.', Both compounds had never been isolated or characterized from rice bran
    due to their relatively small amounts., 'Therefore, finding these rice bran sterols
    and their biological effect on anti-tumor activity is novel.', 'Mostly, edible
    rice bran contains 24-methylenecholesterol as a free sterol or trans\- and cis-ferulate
    that had anti-inflammatory activity.', 'The 24-methylene-ergosta-7-en-3-ol compound
    had been reported in culms and leaves of traditional African rice, Oryza glaberimma,
    but it had never been shown to benefit human health.', 'In RBDS2 sub-fraction,
    gramisterol  was more abundant than any of the other sterols.', 'Therefore, it
    probably is the most active anti-tumor sterol against WEHI-3 cells and its effect
    agrees with a previously reported finding.', Gramisterol in the form of free alcohol
    and their trans\- and cis-ferulate has an anti-inflammatory effect., The other
    minor components in the RBDS2 sub-fraction were less involved in anti-WEHI-3 cancer
    cell proliferation., Fucosterol was previously detected as a major component in
    rice bran oil., 'Its known biological activities include anti-histaminic, anti-cholinergic,
    anti-viral, and hepatoprotective activities in rats.', Cycloeucalenol has been
    reported in the form of cycloeucalenol trans-ferulate in rice germ and is also
    found in Tinospora cordifolia or Guduchi., Its biological effects include cardiotonic  and
    anti-inflammatory activity., 'The detection of lupenone and lupeol in rice bran
    has never been reported, although both have been identified in various therapeutic
    plants.', 'Therefore, this is the first finding of these two triterpenoids and
    their potential anti-cancer cell activities.', Lupenone and lupeol helped to promote
    the inhibition of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B., This significantly decreased
    insulin activity in diabetes and treated obesity., 'Lupeol was reported to have
    anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, anti-protozoal, and anti-microbial activities.',
  It is also known as a cardio-protective agent., RBDS3 and RBDS 4 had less WEHI-3
    anti-proliferation activity than RBDS1 and RBDS2 since they contained compounds
    that possessed several biological activities and may only partially participate
    in cancer inhibition., 'Phytosterols from plant food-based diet, such as vegetables,
    cereals, and nuts are bioavailable.', This diet is the main source of phytosterols
    for humans and the intake of phytosterols in human depends on the amount and type
    of plant products consumed., A natural diet rich in phytosterols is likely to
    provide around 1000 mg of phytosterols per day., The consumption of naturally
    occurring phytosterols has been estimated to range from 150 to 450 mg per day.,
  The high amount of phytospterols intake is from vegetarian diet; dietary patterns
    that are consistent with a reduction of breast cancer risk., 'Due to the structural
    differences between phytosterols and cholesterol, phytosterols are less absorbed
    in animals or humans.', Estimates of the bioavailability of dietary sterols have
    been approximated from controlled intestinal perfusion studies with healthy normal
    men., 'Under these experimental settings, sterol bioavailability averaged 33%
    for cholesterol, 10% for campesterol, 5% for stigmasterol, and 4% for -sitosterol.',
  The vast majority of the phytosterols ingested remain in the gastrointestinal  tract.,
  'In healthy humans, with daily phytosterol intakes of 150 mg/day, only 0.3 mg/dL
    phytosterols are found in the blood.', 'However, this blood phytosterol concentration
    is sufficient to reach the anti-leukemic cell proliferation effect of the active
    black rice bran sub-fraction.', 'In order to increase concentration levels of
    phytosterols in blood, the phytosterols can be extracted from certain plant foods
    and added in higher doses to various other foods or dietary supplement products.',
  'The good understanding of the chemistry and composition of phytochemicals in certain
    plant food, such as black rice, and especially of the compounds that contribute
    to its important bioactivity is considered a prerequisite for the works on future
    functional food development efforts using free phytosterols.', The relative amounts
    of seven sterols and four triterpenoids were determined in the unsaponified fraction
    of the RBD extract of black rice bran cv., Riceberry., 'The structure of these
    sterols and triterpenoids were confirmed using GC-MS, LC-MS, 1H-NMR, and 13C-NMR
    techniques.', 'Sterols; 24-methylene-ergosta-7-en-3-ol, and triterpenoids, lupenone,
    and lupeol were noted for the first time in rice bran extracts.', '-Sitosterol
    was found by GC-MS as the major component, followed by 24-methylenecycloartanol,
    which was in a significant amount in oryzanols.', 'RBDS2 sub-fraction of rice
    bran extract that contains significant amount of gramisterol, along with other
    minor components; fucosterol, cycloeucalenol, lupenone and lupeol, efficiently
    reduces WEHI-3 cancer cell proliferation.', This study showed that gramisterol
    plays a significant role in anti-leukemic cancer cell., 'Therefore, it is interesting
    to explore the biological activities of gramisterol in animal models since it
    has potential human benefits in terms of anti-cancer drug development.', This
    study was funded by the Nation Research Council of Thailand  to S. Mahatheeranont
