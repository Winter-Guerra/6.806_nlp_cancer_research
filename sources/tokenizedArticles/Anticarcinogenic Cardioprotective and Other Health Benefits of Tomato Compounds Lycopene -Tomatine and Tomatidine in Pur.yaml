text: ['Tomatoes produce the bioactive compounds lycopene and -tomatine that are reported
    to have potential health-promoting effects in animals and humans, but our understanding
    of the roles of these compounds in the diet is incomplete.', 'Our current knowledge
    gained from the chemistry and analysis of these compounds in fresh and processed
    tomatoes and from studies on their bioavailability, bioactivity, and mechanisms
    of action against cancer cells and other beneficial bioactivities including antibiotic,

    in cells, animals, and humans is discussed and interpreted here.', Areas for future

    Tomatoes are a major source of nourishment for the worlds population.', World
    production of tomatoes is estimated at around 159 million tons with about 13 million
    tons grown in the United States., 'Tomato plants  synthesize the bioactive carotenoid
    pigments lycopene and -carotene and the glycoalkaloids dehydrotomatine, -tomatine,
    and esculeoside A, possibly as a defense against bacteria, fungi, viruses, and
    insects.', 'About 20 years ago, we initiated studies designed to increase our
    knowledge of the analysis, composition, and bioactivities of tomato compounds,
    cited here in chronological order.', 'As discussed in one of our studies, nature
    seems to have decreed that the concentration of the red lycopene pigment should
    increase as the tomato fruit ripens and changes color on the vine.', This increase
    is accompanied by a concurrent decrease in the concentration of tomatine., 'Green
    tomatoes therefore have a high content of tomatine, as high as 500 mg/kg fresh
    wt, whereas the highest content in red tomatoes is only about 5 mg/kg.', Tomatoes
    at intermediate stages of maturity contain less lycopene and more tomatine than
    do mature tomatoes., 'For example, the reported lycopene content  of large green
    tomatoes increases from 8 to 124, to 230, then to 374, and finally to 412  in
    the stages of fruit ripening.', 'In addition, environmental factors, agricultural
    practice, size, and color of different tomato varieties and conditions used to
    process tomatoes into juices, ketchup, pastes, purees, sauces, soups, and dry
    tomatoes all are reported to influence the content of bioactive compounds.', 'For
    example, the tomatine content of the same variety of tomatoes harvested from plants
    grown under organic soil and environmental conditions is about twice that of fruit
    from plants grown under conventional conditions.', 'In addition to investigations
    of the beneficial properties of the tomato products described above, the use of
    tomato-based edible antimicrobial films has been studied as a means of preventing
    the adverse effects of contaminated food and promoting human health associated
    with the consumption of tomatoes.', 'Because both lycopene and -tomatine have
    been reported to elicit anticarcinogenic and other beneficial effects in vitro
    and in vivo, the main objective of this overview is to integrate the widely scattered
    information on the anticarcinogenic potential of these two bioactive tomato compounds
    in particular, both in pure form and in widely consumed fresh and processed tomatoes.',
  Brief summaries of their cardiovascular and other beneficial effects are also included.,
  'The aim here is also to suggest further research approaches in these areas to potentially
    enhance the health-promoting effects of these natural compounds, individually
    and in combination with other bioactive food ingredients.', The overlapping cellular
    and molecular mechanistic aspects of the research are described for a better understanding
    of the health-promoting potential of the tomato compounds., Such an understanding
    can lead to the development of improved tomatoes and tomato-based foods designed
    to enhance nutrition and health., The first part of this review covers lycopene
    and the second part covers the tomato glycoalkaloid -tomatine and the aglycone
    tomatidine., 'Tomatoes seem to contain about 80% of dietary lycopene, with apricots,
    pink grapefruits, pink guavas, papayas, red carrots, watermelons, and algae contributing
    the other 20%.', The red pigment lycopene is a polyunsaturated  straight-chain
    molecule containing 13 double bonds with a molecular weight of 536.9 and an absorption
    maximum of 470 nm., The double bonds can exist in trans and cis configurations.,
  'Although the all-trans form seems to be the natural form of lycopene synthesized
    by the tomato plant, the molecule is susceptible to isomerization under the influence
    of conditions used to process food, including heat, light, acids, and oxygen.',
  The trans form is also partly transformed in vivo to the more bioactive cis form.,
  Figure 1., Structures of bioactive tomato compounds., 'The structure of esculeoside
    A was adapted from Nohara et al., and the structures of the two lycopene isomers
    were adapted from Hernandez-Marin et al.', Strong antioxidative and other in vitro
    and in vivo beneficial effects of lycopenes are associated with their ability
    to act as free radical scavengers., 'Lycopene is a highly efficient singlet oxygen
    quencher, both in vitro and in plasma, suggesting that its antioxidant effects
    might involve scavenging free electrons from reactive oxygen species.', 'Free
    radicals are highly reactive, short-lived molecules that can react with and damage
    essential structural proteins, enzymes, and DNA.', 'Such damage has the potential
    to cause cancer, atherosclerosis, cardiovascular, and other diseases.', 'Lycopene
    has the potential to reduce such undesirable molecular events because the high-energy,
    highly reactive free electron on DNA is transformed to a much less reactive more
    stable  free electron  after it is dissipated  along the conjugated 13 double
    bonds of the lycopene molecule.', An analogous mechanism governs antioxidative
    effects of plant phenolic compounds such as chlorogenic acid., 'These observations
    can explain the extraordinary multidisciplinary interest in lycopene, as evidenced
    by the fact that the Scopus database lists more than 6400 citations under lycopene.',
  'Here, we will discuss some of the relevant multidisciplinary studies that enhance
    our understanding of the role of tomato-derived lycopene in the plant and in the
    diet.', 'The mostly trans-lycopene isomer in fresh tomatoes is converted both
    in vitro under the influence of heat and enzymatically in vivo to less stable
    but more bioavailable 9-, 13-, and 15-cis-lycopenes.', The following capsule summaries
    provide an introduction into the extensive literature on the analysis of lycopene
    isomers., 'Because geometrical isomers of carotenoids differ in their stability
    to oxidants and bioavailability, with the cis-isomer of lycopene being more bioavailable
    than the trans-form, it is important to know the content of cis/trans  isomers
    for nutritional and other studies.', 'To meet this need, Melendez-Martinez et
    al.', used an HPLC method to analyze up to 48 carotenoid  isomers in 62 min and
    to detect 26 isomers in biological samples., Ishida et al., used an HPLC method
    to follow the partial transformation of all-tetra-cis-lycopene during heating
    and juicing of tangerine tomatoes to trans\- and other cis-forms., 'In another
    study, Hernandez-Marin et al.', calculated antioxidant properties of lycopene
    isomers and their relative abilities to transfer one electron to the hydroxyl
    radical., 'The calculations predict that neutral cis\- and trans-isomers maintain
    the same color, whereas the color of ionic species shifts to a longer wavelength.',
  'Interestingly, refluxing a tomato resin in ethyl acetate for 1 week results in
    transformation of the lycopene E-isomer to the more stable and more bioavailable
    13Z-, 9Z-, and 5Z-lycopene isomers.', Plasma levels of lycopene isomers are related
    to the levels present in food., Consumption patterns of carotenoid isomers can
    be used to improve disease prevention., Honest et al., reviewed the literature
    on the relationship between lycopene isomerization and bioavailability and bioactivity
    properties., Additional studies designed to optimize the analysis of lycopene
    and its isomers in different milieus are described by Panthee et al., and Luterotti
    et al., 'The availability of C-13 labeled lycopene is expected to facilitate human
    bioavailability, metabolism, and pharmacokinetic studies.', 'Several factors can
    affect the lycopene  content of fresh tomatoes, as highlighted in the following
    selected studies.', Figure 2., HPLC chromatogram showing separation of lycopene
    and -carotene in a red tomato extract., Cherry tomatoes grown under the influence
    of moderate salt stress contained higher amounts carotenoids and exhibited increased
    lipophilic antioxidative capacity compared with tomatoes grown in the absence
    of stress., 'The carotenoid content of different tomato varieties  grown in Ireland
    differed significantly from those grown in Spain, suggesting that geographical
    location has a greater effect on carotenoid content and bioaccessability, which
    is defined as the amount of ingested carotenoids available for absorption by the
    intestinal cells after digestion.', Tomatoes grown under organic conditions contained
    greater amounts of total phenolics  as well as -tomatine than tomatoes grown under
    conventional conditions., 'Evidently, because of the absence of synthetic pesticides,
    tomato plants grown under organic conditions synthesize more secondary metabolites
    for protection against phytopathogens than do tomato plants grown under conventional
    conditions.', Sun et al., describe genes that control lycopene content of growing
    tomatoes., Amplification of these genes using molecular biology techniques might
    make it possible to create high-lycopene tomatoes., It is also relevant to note
    that the carbon to nitrogen  ratio of the tomato plant seems to be a good indicator
    of the concentrations of phenolic compounds and tomatine that are involved in
    defense against phytopathogens., 'We recently found that the lycopene and -carotene
    contents as well as the contents of 11 phenolic compounds of 12 different varieties
    of greenhouse-grown commercial cherry tomatoes varied widely, suggesting that
    genetic factors seem to govern the biosynthesis of bioactive compounds in cherry
    tomatoes.', 'Exposure of tomatoes to processing conditions used by food processors,
    restaurants, and in the home designed to prepare a wide range of edible tomato
    products can, in principle, adversely or beneficially affect the lycopene content
    of the final products, as illustrated by the following selected observations.',
  An early review on the influence of food processing on lycopene states that  thermal
    processing  causes some loss in tomato-based foods;  heat induces isomerization
    of the all-trans\- to the cis-form;  dehydrated and powdered tomatoes have poor
    lycopene stability;  frozen and heat-sterilized foods exhibit excellent stability;  the
    bioavailability of the cis-isomers in foods is higher than that of all -trans
    -isomers; and  lycopene bioavailability in processed products is higher than in
    fresh tomatoes., Analysis of catsup  from 13 commercial sources showed that the
    content of lycopene ranged from 59.4 to 183.6 g/g and the Trolox equivalent antioxidant
    capacity from 176.5 to 356.8 TEAC units., The antioxidative activity of ketchup
    was related to its content of trans-lycopene., 'Thermal processing of tomato pulp
    at 130 C improved the in vitro bioaccessability of lycopene, defined as the fraction
    of the nutrient that is released from the food matrix.', all-trans-Lycopene and
    other carotenoids underwent isomerization during canning and storage of tomato
    juice., 'Related studies showed that  during storage of tomato juices, lycopene
    degradation varied as a function of the tomato cultivar, processing method, storage
    temperature, and time and that the use combined pressureheat treatments increases
    lycopene extractability; and  exposure of tomato juice to pulsed electric fields
    resulted in a higher content of polyphenolic compounds  and had a higher content
    of volatile compounds and better sensory properties than juice prepared with untreated
    tomatoes.', A study with tomato pasta indicates that the in vitro accessibility
    of lycopene seems to be influenced by the conditions applied during in vitro intestinal
    digestion., High-pressure sterilization of a tomato puree limited lycopene isomerization
    compared with the equivalent thermal sterilization., Aseptic thermal processing
    of tomato soup reduced vitamin C content but had only a minor effect on lycopene
    content., 'Oven-baking of sliced tomatoes at 160 C for 20 min resulted in significant
    increases in the content of lycopene, -carotene, and -tocopherol, isomerization
    of all-E to various Z isomers, and in an increased release of the carotenoids
    and tocopherols from the tomato matrix.', 'An investigation of industrial processing
    on the stability of tomato carotenoids indicates that, overall, the nutritional
    quality of tomato-processed products is mainly preserved during manufacture, except
    for vitamin C.


    Thermal and pressure treatment of a puree containing olive oil induced both degradation
    of lycopene and conversion of trans\- to cis-isomers.', 'A related study found
    that thermal treatment of tomatoes breaks down cell walls, thus facilitating the
    release of carotenoids and tocopherols from the matrix, and increases isomerization
    of lycopene and to a lesser extent of -carotene.', Postharvest treatment of vine-ripe
    tomatoes resulted in a 14% increase in lycopene and a decrease in -carotene content.,
  'Other tomato processing conditions that might affect the content and bioavailability
    of lycopene include exposure to a pulsed electric field, supercritical extraction,
    and high-pressure homogenization.', Real-time monitoring of lycopene content during
    the production of tomato juice may allow payment to tomato growers based on the
    lycopene content of the crops., Numerous studies have been devised to attempt
    to determine whether the observed cancer cell-inhibiting effects of lycopene in
    vitro could be confirmed in vivo in animal models and in humans., Selected recent
    studies mentioned below show that the results do not seem to offer a definitive
    answer., 'Because tomato and soy products have each shown anti-prostate cancer
    activity in laboratory studies, Zuniga et al.', determined the effect of dietary
    tomato and soy germ alone and in combination against prostate carcinogenesis in
    the transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate  model., The results show
    that the combination diet was most effective in reducing the proliferative index  in
    the prostate epithelium of the mice., The authors suggest the need to develop
    tomatosoy foods with defined composition and bioactivities for clinical trials.,
  A structureactivity study of 11 synthetic carotenoids  against breast cancer cells
    provides mechanistic evidence for their bioactivities in terms of activation of
    the electrophile/antioxidant response element  transcription system and induced
    expression of phase II metabolizing enzymes., Related studies suggest that some
    of the cellular effects of carotenoids might be mediated through their derivatives
    formed in vivo by chemical oxidation or enzymatic cleavage inside the cells.,
  'On the basis of a review of the literature, Sporn and Liby concluded that although
    lycopene has been shown to prevent cancer in experimental animals, the compound
    is not potent enough to be clinically useful as a drug for prostate cancer, mainly
    because high concentrations above 1 mol/L are needed to achieve meaningful biological
    responses in humans.', Ilic et al., came to a similar conclusion on the basis
    of an analysis of the literature that there is insufficient evidence to either
    support or refute the use of lycopene for the prevention of prostate cancer.,
  Related studies examine differences in consumption of carotenoids by different ethnic
    groups and the association between the prostate-specific antigen  screening test
    and lycopene consumption., 'Unlike anticancer drugs, the molecular mechanisms
    of natural compounds involve modulation of multiple targets, including transcription
    factors, growth factors, tumor cell survival factors, inflammatory pathways, and
    invasion and angiogenesis linked to carcinogenesis.', 'The complex, overlapping
    mechanisms of lycopene action on cancer cells involving antioxidant, anti-inflammatory,
    immunostimulating effects, up-regulation of connexin-43, and modulation of cyclo-oxygenase
    pathways, growth factors, and growth factor receptors have been extensively studied.',
  The following brief summaries of selected biomarkers and signaling pathways offer
    an indication of the complexity of these mechanisms., Lycopene-induced apoptosis
    against hepatocarcinogenesis in female Balb/c mice might be due to its ability
    to act on apoptosis-associated genes and as a pro-oxidant., 'Proteins in human
    primary prostatic epithelial cells that were most affected by lycopene were those
    that were involved in antioxidant responses, apoptosis, growth inhibition, androgen
    receptor signaling, and the Akt/mTOR signaling cascade, confirming previous studies
    that lycopene can prevent cancer in human prostatic epithelial cells at the stages
    of cancer initiation, promotion, and/or progression.', Lycopene selectively inhibited
    MCF-7 breast cancer cells but not MCF-10 normal mammary epithelial cells., 'The
    inhibition of cell growth is associated with the modulation of cell cycle proteins
    such as  tubulins as well as heat shock proteins, decreasing tumors in Balb/c
    mice by 42%.', 'Exposure of human breast  and endometrial  cancer cells to lycopene
    resulted in the reduction in cyclin D1, a growth factor sensor in the G1 phase
    of cell division, suggesting that the attenuation of cyclin D1 levels is a key
    mechanism for the reduction of the mitogenic action of the insulin-like growth
    factor, which plays an important role in the proliferation of normal and cancer
    cells.', Lycopene induces cell growth inhibition by altering the mevalonate pathway
    in Ras gene-activated prostatic carcinoma LBCaP cells through inactivation of
    Ras and reduction of intracellular total cholesterol via inhibition of the expression
    of the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylgutaryl-coenzyme A  that catalyzes cholesterol
    biosynthesis., 'Both lycopene and, to a greater extent, the aldehyde oxidation
    product formed in vivo called apo-12-lycopenal reduce proliferation in androgen-independent
    DU145 prostate cancer cells and in mouse embryonic fibroblasts and rat tumors
    by inhibiting normal cell cycle progression without affecting the gap junction
    communication protein connexin 43.', A suggested mechanism underlying the antiangiogenic
    activity  in mice involves inhibition of the matrix metalloproteinase-2 /urokinase-type
    plasminogen activator  system through vascular endothelial growth factor receptor
    -mediated reduction in protein expression of the P13K-At and ERK/p38 signaling
    pathways., 'Lycopene seems to act as an in vivo redox agent that protects tissues
    against high concentrations of ROS, thus preventing oxidative damage of cells
    and DNA.', 'Lycopene protected rats against induced liver tumors by altering the
    expression of Bax, Bcl-2, caspases, and oxidative stress biomarkers.', 'Here,
    we briefly mention several additional potential health-promoting effects ascribed
    to lycopene.', 'Physiological concentrations of lycopene attenuated the lipopolysaccharide
    -mediated induction of TNF- in RAW 264.7 macrophages at both the mRNA and protein
    levels, suggesting that the anti-inflammatory effect of lycopene could result
    in a disruption of the undesirable interactions between adipocytes and macrophages
    in adipose tissues in obese individuals.', 'The immune system in suckling BALV/c
    mice pups was not affected by lycopene-containing breast milk, and lycopene also
    had no effect on the colonization of the intestines, spleens, and livers by Yersinia
    enterocolitica in female neonatals and pups infected with the enteropathogen.',
  The cardioprotective effect of lycopene on induced oxidative stress and heart lysosomal
    damage in rats was accompanied by up-regulation of interleukin -12 and interferon
    -., 'Preincubation of airway cells with lycopene resulted in an 85% reduction
    in rhinovirus-1B replication, suggesting that the pigment might have a role in
    suppressing rhinovirus-induced airway inflammation.', The antineuroinflammatory
    effect of lycopene seems to be associated with inhibition of LPS-induced Cox-2
    expression mediated by HO-1 activation through the AMPK pathway., 'Lycopene reduced
    the DNA damage and recovered the liver and kidney tissue injuries in rats with
    obstructive jaundice, suggesting that it might be of value in the treatment of
    sepsis, a virulent infection-related disease that causes 250,000 annual deaths
    in the United States.', 'Lycopene inhibited hepatic steatosis in mice fed a high-fat
    diet via microRNA-21-induced down-regulation of fatty acid-binding protein 7,
    suggesting that the compound could be used to treat nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.',
  Tomato juice administration partially reverted the metabolic pattern of the rat
    liver from a high-fat diet to a normal diet., 'Lycopene, lutein, and -carotene
    acted synergistically in protecting mice against peritonitis, suggesting the need
    for further studies on the efficacy of combinations of these phytonutrients against
    the production of pro-inflammatory mediators.', Lycopene and carotene protected
    the skin against sunburn  by increasing basal defense against UV light mediated
    damage., No official recommendation exists for lycopene consumption., 'With this
    objective in mind, we will briefly mention selected studies on lycopene consumption
    and bioavailability in humans.', A bioavailability study showed that plasma lycopene
    levels of nine healthy young adults increased during consumption of a spinachtomato
    diet from 0.05 to 0.52 M/L and that levels of the carotenoid lutein increased
    after spinach consumption from 0.05 to 1.59 M/L., 'The consumption of lunches
    containing 300 g of tangerine tomatoes or red tomato sauce per day by 21 healthy
    American adults showed that tangerine tomatoes, which contained about 3 times
    less of the tetra-cis-lycopene isomer than did tomato sauce, increased blood lycopene
    levels more than did the red tomato sauce, showing that the tetra-cis-lycopene
    is absorbed more efficiently than the trans-form from common red tomatoes and
    suggesting that total lycopene blood concentrations in humans can be increased
    by substituting tetra-cis-lycopene-rich tangerine tomatoes for common red tomatoes
    in the diet.', The average lycopene intake mostly from raw tomatoes by Canadian
    women  was 6.14  5.35 mg/day., 'The mean lycopene intake by Belgian adults  from
    tomatoes  and sauces  was 4.1  2.3 mg/day, suggesting that the intake was comparable
    to intakes reported in neighboring countries but was below the acceptable or desirable
    daily intake.', 'The mean intake of -carotene, lycopene, and lutein by Polish
    adults was 6.3, 7.0, and 2.7 mg/person/day, respectively, with lycopene originating
    from fresh tomatoes  and processed tomato products.', 'The consumption by 26 individuals
    of a commercial drink sold in Italy containing a tomato extract for 26 days resulted
    in a significant increase in plasma and lymphocyte lycopene levels and a 42% reduction
    of DNA damage in lymphocytes subjected to oxidative stress, suggesting that carotenoids
    from tomato products can protect cells against oxidants.', 'The consumption of
    tomato and vegetable soups by 60 individuals for 15 days resulted in a significant
    increase in total plasma lycopene concentrations, an increase in the ratio of
    cis\- to trans-lycopene isomers, and a significant increase in ex vivo lipoprotein
    lag period used as a measure of antioxidant capacity.', A cross-sectional survey
    of 986 Japanese individuals 70 years and older showed that a tomato-rich diet
    is independently related to a lower prevalence of symptoms of depression and that
    the intake of other vegetables had no effect., 'Serum concentrations of the cytokines
    IL-6 and TNF- decreased significantly in overweight female students  but not in
    control females consuming 330 mL/day tomato juice, suggesting that increasing
    tomato intake may help reduce inflammatory diseases associated with the two cytokines.',
  'The daily consumption of tomato products  containing 30 mg of lycopene by 17 individuals
    for 4 weeks resulted in an increase of the average serum lycopene level from 182
    to 685 nmol/L and a significant reduction in lipid and protein oxidation, suggesting
    that a tomato-rich diet containing different sources of lycopene can increase
    serum lycopene levels and reduce oxidative stress.', 'A soy-fortified tomato juice
    containing a total of 14.13 mol/100 mL lycopene + -carotene significantly improved
    blood lipid and antioxidant status during an 8 week trial in healthy men and women,
    suggesting that this functional food can be used to deliver defined amounts of
    bioactive compounds in long-term clinical trials.', 'Human bioavailability of
    lycopene from red carrots  was similar to that from tomato paste, whereas it was
    2.6 times more bioavailable from papayas than from tomatoes.', 'Here, we will
    briefly mention selected beneficial effects of lycopene-containing food in humans.',
  An epidemiological study in China with 130 prostate cancer patients and 274 hospital
    controls showed that prostate cancer risk was reduced with increased intake of
    green tea and lycopene-containing fruits and vegetables and that the combination
    has a stronger effect than either dietary component consumed separately., 'A whole
    food intervention study with cancer-free African-American men  at a higher prostate
    cancer risk resulted in 53 and 40% increases in plasma lycopene concentrations
    in months 1 and 3, respectively, with no change in the control group.', An analysis
    of prospective cohort studies on the relationship between carotenoids and breast
    cancer  suggests that women with higher circulating levels of carotenoids  may
    experience reduced risk of breast cancer., A meta analysis  showed that a high
    intake of lycopene and other carotenoids is associated with a lower risk of esophageal
    cancer., An inverse association seems to exist between the consumption of tomato
    products among middle-aged and older women  and cardiovascular disease., 'Women
    consuming &gt;10 servings/week of tomato-based food products  compared to ;1.5
    servings/week had a clinically modest but significant improvement in several coronary
    biomarkers  cholesterol ratio, and hemoglobin A1c).', 'The consumption of tomato
    products rich in lycopene by 25 men and women on a high-fat diet attenuated induced
    oxidative stress and associated inflammatory response, suggesting a potentially
    protective role of tomato consumption in reducing CVD.', 'Overall, a greater amelioration
    of CVD risk factors  was observed in 18 healthy women consuming tomato juice supplemented
    with n-3-polyunsaurated fatty acids versus plain tomato juice.', 'A study designed
    to determine lycopenes ability to modulate systemic and high-density lipoprotein
    -associated inflammation in moderately overweight middle-aged individuals showed
    that the tomato compound significantly increased HDL functionality, revealing
    the heart-protective properties of increased lycopene intake.', A 2 week intervention
    study with Mexican individuals  showed that consumption of two raw tomatoes per
    day for 2 weeks resulted in a significant increase in HDL  plasma cholesterol
    from 36.5 to 41.6 mg/DL., An intervention trial with healthy middle-aged volunteers
    showed that a high daily consumption of tomato-based products  or lycopene supplements  was
    ineffective in reducing CVD inflammatory and insulin resistance markers., 'Low
    plasma concentrations of antioxidative lutein and zeaxanthin, but not lycopene,
    -cryptoxanthin, or -carotene, were associated with increased risk of atrial fibrillation
    in elderly individuals.', 'The administration of tomato-based food for special
    medical purposes  to 8 healthy volunteers and 39 patients with chronic hepatitis
    C virus  prevented carotenoid serum depletion, did not affect the therapeutic
    response, but was effective in improving the oxidative stress during viral therapy.',
  'A prospective study of 1031 Finnish men aged 4665 years showed that men with the
    highest quartile of serum lycopene had 59 and 55% lower risks of ischemic stroke
    and any stroke, respectively, compared with men in the lowest quartile.', A clinical
    study showed that locally delivered lycopene gel was effective in reducing gingival
    inflammation and injury compared to a placebo in smoking and nonsmoking subjects.,
  'The cited human consumption, bioavailability, and health-promoting studies originating
    from different countries clearly show that plasma lycopene levels are a function
    of the dietary content of fresh and processed tomatoes and that high levels are
    associated with lower risk of CVD and some cancers.', 'I agree with the suggestion
    by a journal reviewer that because lycopenes are more bioavailable from processed
    than from fresh tomatoes, clinical and epidemiological studies should compare
    beneficial effects from both lycopene sources.', 'We previously reported that
    the tomato glycoalkaloid referred to as tomatine  consisted of a 10:1 mixture
    of -tomatine and dehydrotomatine.', The structure of dehydrotomatine is different
    from that of -tomatine in that the former molecule has a double bond in the steroidal
    ring B of the aglycone., 'Note that both tomato glycoalkaloids have the same tetrasaccharide
    side chain, lycotetraose.', '-Tomatine has lycotetraose attached to the aglycone
    tomatidine, whereas dehydrotomatine has lycotetraose attached to the aglycone
    tomatidenol.', Figure 3., HPLC chromatogram showing separation of dehydrotomatine  and
    -tomatine  using  UV detection and  pulsed amperometric detection., The term tomatine
    implies the presence of both glycoalkaloids., Adapted from Friedman and Levin.,
  We used two methods to identify dehydrotomatine and -tomatine., 'First, retention
    times on HPLC peaks of pure dehydrotomatine and -tomatine were compared to corresponding
    peaks from the tomato extracts.', 'Second, samples from each peak, collected several
    times from the HPLC column, were then acid hydrolyzed into sugars and aglycone.',
  The sugars were converted to trimethylsilyl ester derivatives., Individual compositions
    and molar ratios of sugars were determined by gasliquid chromatography., 'Sugars
    and aglycones were determined by gas chromatographymass spectrometry, as described
    in detail in previous publications.', The quantification of dehydrotomatine and
    -tomatine was accomplished by comparing the HPLC peak area from the sample to
    the peak area of known amounts of pure dehydrotomatine and -tomatine isolated
    from tomato fruits., Figure 2 shows that dehydrotomatine eluted from the HPLC
    column well separated from -tomatines elution time., The detection limit was estimated
    at 0.39 g for dehydrotomatine and 0.94 g for -tomatine., 'The dehydrotomatine
    and -tomatine of tomatoes varied from 42 to 1498 g/g of fresh wt and from 521
    to 16285 g/g of fresh wt, respectively.', 'The ratio of -tomatine to dehydrotomatine
    ranged from 10.9 to 12.5 in tomatoes and from 2.3 to 7.8 in other plant tissues,
    suggesting that the biosynthesis of the glycoalkaloids seems to be under separate
    genetic control in each plant part.', 'Another study showed that  the dehydrotomatine
    content of six green tomatoes  ranged from 0.89 to 8.05, a 9.0-fold variation
    from lowest to highest value;  the corresponding range for -tomatine was from
    5.7 to 31.40, a 5.5-fold variation;  the sums of the concentrations of the two
    glycoalkaloids ranged from 6.64 to 39.45, a 5.9-fold variation; and  the total
    glycoalkaloid content per tomato fruit  ranged from 434.0 to 1110.4, a 2.56-fold
    variation.', It is well-known that tomatine decreases during the ripening process.,
  'The cited data show that both individual and total amounts of glycoalkaloids in
    green tomatoes vary widely, but less so when calculated in terms of concentration
    per fruit.', 'Although the glycoalkaloid content per weight of fruit decreases
    as the fruit grows, the values per unit fruit remain about the same, until the
    fruit turns red, at which time the tomatine is nearly completely degraded.', 'Statistical
    analysis showed that size, maturity, and glycoalkaloid content are well correlated.',
  Additional studies on the analysis of tomato glycoalkaloids are described in the
    cited references., 'Interestingly, some wild-type potato cultivars contain high
    amounts of -tomatine, as do edible cultivars grown in the Andes mountains of Peru.',
  'Inhibitory concentrations at 50%  values for -tomatine were calculated by constructing
    a four-parameter logistic curve using the values from percentage inhibition of
    normal and human cancer cells, with the aid of SigmaPlot 11 ; the IC50 was extrapolated
    from the graph at 50% cell inhibition.', 'The IC50 was compared to a number of
    variables in the tomatoes: tomato size, ripeness, and alkaloid content.', 'Using
    a microculture tetrazolium  in vitro assay, we previously reported that tomatine
    is a strong inhibitor of growth for both human colon and liver cancer cell lines,
    as evidenced by the dose-dependent  inhibition of HT29 colon cancer cells at levels
    ranging from 38.0 to 81.5% and of human HepG2 cancer cells from 46.3 to 89.2%.',
  The anticarcinogenic activity against human liver cancer cells at a tomatine concentration
    of 1 g/mL was greater than the corresponding activity observed with the commercial
    anticancer drug doxorubicin., 'Other beneficial effects of tomatine include lowering
    cholesterol and triglycerides, enhancing the immune system, and protecting against
    virulent bacteria and protozoa.', 'Tomatine is also reported to induce T-cell-mediated
    regression of murine lymphoid experimental tumors, EG7-Ova.', 'To help define
    the possible roles of the four sugar moieties attached to -tomatine in the inhibition
    of cancer cell growth, we compared the growth-inhibiting effect of -tomatine to
    four hydrolysis products with three, two, one, and zero sugar side chains  against
    three cancer and two normal cell lines using the MTT cell viability and tumor
    necrosis factor  assays.', These compounds were prepared by partial acid hydrolysis
    of -tomatine and characterized by thin layer chromatography  and mass spectrometry.,
  The results  show that the tetrasaccharide side chain associated with -tomatine
    is a key structural feature of the molecule that influences the inhibition of
    both normal and cancer cells., 'Systematic removal of one, two, or three sugar
    residues from -tomatine results in the formation of compounds with significantly
    reduced activity.', Figure 4., 'IC50 values for the inhibition of one normal and
    four cancer human cell lines: normal human liver  and lung  cell lines, human
    prostate, breast, and gastric adenocarcinoma  cell lines by -tomatine isolated
    from green tomatoes and hydrolysis products.', Adapted from Choi et al., We also
    investigated six green and three red tomato extracts for their ability to induce
    cell death in human cancer and normal cells using an microculture MTT assay.,
  'Compared to untreated controls, the high-tomatine green tomato extracts strongly
    inhibited the following human cancer cell lines: breast, colon, gastric, and hepatoma,
    as well as normal human liver cells.', There was little inhibition of the cells
    by the three low-tomatine red tomato extracts., 'We also evaluated cell death
    induced by the pure glycoalkaloids dehydrotomatine and -tomatine isolated from
    green tomatoes and characterized by HPLC, GC, and GC-MS, as well as their respective
    aglycones tomatidenol and tomatidine.', -Tomatine was highly effective in inhibiting
    all of the cell lines., 'Dehydrotomatine, tomatidenol, and tomatidine had little,
    if any, effect on cell inhibition.', The results show that the susceptibility
    to destruction of the cells varies with the nature of the alkaloid and plant extract
    and the type of cancer cell., Our discovery that -tomatine is a potent anticarcinogen
    seems to have stimulated interest by other investigators in defining the detailed
    molecular mechanism of apoptosis., 'Here, we will briefly summarize published
    information on the inhibition of cancer by -tomatine.', Shih et al., investigated
    the mechanism of the antimetastatic effect of -tomatine in human lung adenocarcinoma
    A549 cells., 'They found that the glycoalkaloid  inhibited cell invasion and migration
    and phosphorylation of Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 ;  did
    not affect phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase  and the p38 gene;  decreased
    nuclear levels of nuclear factor kappa B, c-Fos, and C-Jun; and  inhibited binding
    abilities of NF-B and activator protein-1.', 'These and related molecular events
    suggest that inhibition of metastasis occurs by reducing MMP-2, MMP-9, and u-PA
    activities through suppression of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt (PI3K/Akt
    or ERK1/2 signaling pathway and inhibition of NF-B or AP-1 binding activities.',
  The authors suggest that these results indicate that -tomatine may have therapeutic
    value in the treatment of lung cancer., A related study by Shieh et al., confirmed
    that -tomatine suppressed invasion and migration of human nonsmall lung cancer
    NCI-H460 cells through inactivation of the FAK/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and
    lowering binding activity of NF-B., 'The proposed mechanism of the antimetastatic
    effect occurs through inactivation of the signaling pathway and enhancement of
    IkB protein expressions to reduce NF-B DNA binding activity, resulting in down-regulation
    of MMP-7 expression.', Additional events that contribute to inhibition of cell
    migration and invasion include interference with the rearrangement of the actin
    cytoskeleton by decreasing the expression of pFAK protein., Lee et al., 'investigated
    the molecular mechanism of the antiproliferative effect of -tomatine against human
    prostatic adenocarcinoma PC-3 cells, which we found to be highly susceptible to
    -tomatine.', 'They found that the IC50 of the inhibition was 1.67 M, with cytotoxicity
    against the PC-3 cells occurring after an hour of treatment.', The cytotoxicity
    against normal liver and prostate cells was lower than against the PC-3 cells.,
  'They concluded that cytotoxicity was mainly due to induction of apoptosis, as evidenced
    by decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and increased nuclear condensation;
    polarization of F-actin potential; cell membrane permeability and cytochrome C
    expression; induction of activation of caspase-3, -8, and -9; inhibition of NF-B
    nuclear translocation; and a decrease in NF-B/p50 and NF-Bp65 in the nuclear fraction.',
  These observations imply that both intrinsic and extrinsic pro-apoptosis pathways
    are involved and that -tomatine may protect against prostate cancer development
    and progression., The observation that TNF- treatment enhances the motility and
    invasiveness of prostatic cancer cells suggests that this pro-inflammatory protein
    contributes to cancer metastasis and that -tomatine-induced reduction in TNF-
    levels may help overcome these molecular events., Kdelov et al., discovered that
    -tomatine inhibits human leukemia MOLT-4 cells by activating cell cycle checkpoints
    without damaging single or double DNA strands in the cells., The induced slowing
    of the cell cycle seems to involve caspase-independent cell death associated with
    an increase in p53 and the BH3-only protein and other protein biomarkers associated
    in cell cycle regulation., 'In a long-term study, we showed that feeding 2000
    ppm of commercial tomatine and 224 ppm of the multiorgan carcinogen dibenzopyrene  to
    rainbow trout resulted in reduced incidences of liver and stomach tumors by 41.3
    and 36.3%, respectively, as compared to the incidence of tumors observed with
    DBP alone.', The rainbow trout model is highly sensitive to diverse chemical carcinogens
    and is a statistically powerful vertebrate model used in many comparative studies
    of chemical carcinogenesis and its modulation by dietary inhibitors., 'To our
    knowledge, this study seems to be the first report that evaluated the anticarcinogenicity
    of -tomatine in vivo.', The following in vivo observations seem to confirm the
    health-promoting effects of -tomatine in animal models., Figure 5., Reduction
    of multiple tumors  by orally fed commercial tomatine in trout with dibenzopyrene
    -induced colon cancer., Adapted from Friedman et al., 'Because agents that suppress
    NF-B may inhibit the development of prostate cancer, Lee et al.', evaluated the
    antitumor activity of -tomatine against androgen-independent prostate cancer  cell
    tumors grown in mice., They found that intraperitoneally  administered -tomatine  significantly
    attenuated the growth of the PC-3 cells and that the tumor suppression was associated
    with increased apoptosis and lower proliferation of tumor cells and by reduced
    nuclear translocation of the p50 and p65 gene components of the NF-B signaling
    pathway., 'In vitro, the beneficial apoptotic effect against PC-3 cells was associated
    with several biomarkers of tumor inhibition.', These include reduction of TNF
    activation and the expression of NF-B-dependent anti-apoptotic proteins., This
    study seems to provide evidence that -tomatine can inhibit the growth of prostate
    cancer tumors in vivo without inducing overt toxicity., Tomsik et al., evaluated
    the effect of -tomatine and growth and mitotic activity of solid Ehrlich tumors
    in mice., 'They found that  ip injected tomatine at 1 mg/kg slowed tumor growth
    and reduced tumor cell proliferation;  the combination of -tomatine  and the cancer
    drug doxorubicin  acted synergistically and extended survival of the mice; and  ex
    vivo, -tomatine inhibited intracellular DNA and protein synthesis in the tumor
    cells with IC50 values of 8.7 and 6.6 M, respectively.', 'The authors note that
    the activity against Ehrlich tumors, which are derived from adenocarcinoma of
    the mammary gland, seems to involve the immune system in the inhibition of tumor
    progression, and because the ip LD50 value of -tomatine is high at 32.4 mg/kg,
    the effectiveness of the 1 mg/kg dose seems to indicate that this is a safe dose.',
  'Because the intravenous  LD50 dose is lower at 18 mg/kg than the ip dose, the authors
    suggest that the ip route may be safer.', '-Tomatine improved the ability of the
    cancer drug paclitaxel to induce death of androgen-independent prostate cancer
    PC-3 cells vitro and in mice by down-regulating Akt-regulated pro-survival proteins
    and up-regulating Akt-regulated pro-apoptotic proteins, suggesting that the combination
    could be useful for the treatment of prostate cancer in humans.', 'We do not know
    whether oral consumption of -tomatine, individually or in combination with lycopene
    or cancer drugs, would elicit similar beneficial effects in rodents and humans.',
  The cited studies suggest that the consumption of both high-tomatine green and red
    tomatoes containing tomatine and lycopene may have an additive anticarcinogenic
    effect compared with that of green or red tomatoes alone., 'Because green tomatoes
    turn red rapidly after harvest, to our knowledge high-tomatine green tomatoes
    are available commercially only as pickled green tomatoes.', Other beneficial
    effects of -tomatine have been reported., 'On the basis of the following observations,
    Ito concluded that -tomatine induces programmed cell death by ROS in the fungal
    pathogen Fusarium oxysporum:  cell death occurred only under aerobic condition
    and was blocked by mitochondrial ATPase, caspase, and protein inhibitors;  fungal
    cells showed depolarization of the transmembrane potential of mitochondria and
    ROS accumulation; and  -tomatine activates phosphotyrosine kinase and G-protein
    signaling pathways, leading to the elevation of calcium ions and a ROS burst in
    the cells.', '-Tomatine, the potato glycoalkaloid -chaconine, and the eggplant
    glycoalkaloid -solamargine strongly suppressed during the 4 day test the infection
    of mice by Plasmodium yelli 17XL, the cause of the serious protozoan topical disease
    malaria, suggesting that the tomato, potato, and eggplant glycoalkaloids have
    the potential to protect against malaria.', -Tomatine was also shown to be effective
    in a rodent model as an adjuvant of protective immunity to a vaccine candidate
    of malaria caused by Plasmodium berghei., 'As mentioned above, the aglycone part
    of -tomatine, tomatidine, must also contribute to the overall bioactivity because
    authentic tomatidine also inhibited cancer cells, but at a significantly lower
    rate than the carbohydrate-containing glycoalkaloid.', 'Here, we will briefly
    mention anticarcinogenic and other beneficial effects of tomatidine.', Our studies
    showed that  both -tomatine and tomatidine changed the membrane potential of frog
    embryos and affected active transport in frog skin and  orally consumed tomatidine
    did not significantly affect organ weights of mice., Lavie et al., 'reported that
    tomatidine acted as a potent and effective chemosensitizer in multidrug-resistant
    tumor cells, sensitizing the cells to the cytotoxic action of adriamycin and verapamil.',
  The authors suggest that tomatidine could serve in combination chemotherapy with
    cytotoxic drugs for treating multidrug-resistant cancer., 'Although tomatidine
    did not inhibit A549 human lung carcinoma cells, Yan et al.', discovered that
    nontoxic doses of the alkaloid inhibited the invasion of the A549 cells by reducing
    metalloproteinase expression., 'They found that  tomatidine does not effectively
    inhibit the viability of the A540 cells and  nontoxic doses of the compound suppressed
    cell invasion, did not affect cell migration, reduced mRNA levels of MMP-2 and
    MMP-9, increased the expression of tissue inhibitor metalloproteinase-1, and inhibited
    NF-B activity and ERK and Akt signaling pathways.', The mechanism for the suppression
    of cell invasion is similar to the one we observed with mushrooms., Chiu and Lin
    investigated anti-inflammatory effects of tomatidine and solasodine  in LPS-stimulated
    macrophages., 'Tomatidine decreased inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2
    expression through suppression of I-kB phosphorylation, NF-B nuclear translocation,
    and JNK activation.', 'The results imply that the anti-inflammatory effect seems
    associated with the blockage of NF-B and JNK signaling, suggesting that the aglycone
    could prevent cancer and inflammatory diseases.', 'Solasodine, the structure of
    which is identical to that of tomatidine except that it lacks a double bond in
    the 5,6-position of the B ring, was less potent.', Mitchell et al., investigated
    the inhibition by tomatidine of Staphylococcus aureus small-colony variants  in
    cystic fibrosis airway epithelial cells., SCVs are often associated with S. aureus
    infection encountered by cystic fibrosis patients., The authors found that tomatidine
    was a potent growth inhibitor of SCVs at a minimum inhibitory concentration  of
    0.12 g/mL., The authors suggest that tomatidine in combination with antibiotics
    could eliminate persistent forms of S. aureus that adversely affect the airways
    of cystic fibrosis patients., 'It would be of interest to find out whether the
    olive compound 4-hyroxytyrosol, which we found to inhibit S. aureus bacteria in
    vitro, would also inhibit SCVs.', A related study by Mitchell et al., found that
    tomatidine potentiates the effect of aminoglycoside antibiotics against multiresistant
    S. aureus pathogens by preventing expression of virulence microbial genes., Tomatidine
    also inhibited growth  of Leishmania amazonensis promastigotes flagellated protozoan
    parasites that cause about 2 million new infections annually., 'The mechanism
    of inhibition seems to involve interference with the growth, ultrastructure, sterol
    content, and mitochondrial function of the protozoa.', 'Because tomatoes are reported
    to be contaminated by Salmonella and other foodborne pathogens, it would be of
    interest to find out whether lycopene and tomatine can inactivate the pathogens.',
  Fujiwara et al., 'found that dietary tomatidine significantly ameliorated hyperlipidemia
    and atherosclerosis in apoE-deficient mice by inhibiting acyl-A:cholesterol acyl-transferase  activity.',
  Shao et al., 'found that dietary tomato pomace, seed oil, and defatted seed also
    reduced cholesterol in hamsters.', 'Orally fed esculeoside A, a minor glycoalkaloid
    isolated from ripe tomatoes, reduced serum levels of cholesterol, triglycerides,
    and LDL-cholesterol and ameliorated atherosclerosis in apoE-deficient mice by
    a mechanism similar to that mentioned for tomatidine.', 'Serum cholesterol and
    blood antiplatelet effects elicited by green tomatoes have been reported, effects
    that are most likely due to the high tomatine content of green tomatoes mentioned
    above.', It seems that both -tomatine and tomatidine have the potential to protect
    against CVD., Mechanisms responsible for the anticarcinogenic effects of tomato
    glycoalkaloids differ from mechanisms proposed for lycopene present in red tomatoes.,
  'To place the above-mentioned observations on mechanistic aspects in perspective,
    we will summarize additional reported biological effects of -tomatine and tomatidine.',
  Tomatine alone and tomatine-rich green tomato diets reduced both dietary cholesterol
    bioavailability and endogenous cholesterol., Tomatine inhibited active transport
    by increasing the general permeability of membranes of the surface of averted
    rat jejunal sacs and removed cholesterol from mucosal cells as well as the output
    of cholesterol into the lymph., 'Unlike tomatine, tomatidine did not induce cell
    membrane disruptions in fungi and yeasts.', Tomatine and tomatidine exhibited
    weak inhibition of the Hedgehog  signaling pathway in the embryonic zebra fish
    developmental assay., Such inhibition seems to be associated with developmental
    defects., 'Here, we will mention the available information on the safety of tomatine
    in animal models.', 'The following LD50 values have been reported for tomatine
    in mice : ip, 2533.5; iv, 18; oral, 500; subcutaneous, &gt;1000.', Tomsik et al.,
  note that the 1 mg/kg dose of tomatine they used in their mouse study is a safe
    dose., 'As part of the anticarcinogenic feeding study of tomatine to rainbow trout
    mentioned earlier, we found that the tomatine-containing diets did not induce
    changes in mortality, fish weights, liver weights, or tissue morphology.', No
    adverse pathological effects in the tissues of the fish on the tomatine diets
    were observed., The apparent lack of acute toxicity in the rainbow trout reinforces
    the reported low toxicity in animal models., We observed a similar lack of toxicity
    in hamsters orally fed -tomatine., A key consideration for the use of pure -tomatine
    and of high--tomatine tomatoes in cancer prevention and treatment should be the
    ratio of effective preventive or therapeutic to toxic dose., The apparent nontoxicity
    of tomatine in animal models is reinforced by the fact that Peruvians consume
    without deleterious effects high-tomatine red tomatoes and that in some countries
    high-tomatine pickled green tomatoes are part of the human diet., The bioavailability
    and safety of -tomatine and tomatidine merit further study., 'The cited observations
    suggest that the mechanism of the chemopreventive effect of tomatine may be the
    result of multiple molecular events including the formation of complexes with
    cholesterol, potentiation of the immune system, and direct destruction of cancer
    cells via disruption of cell membranes, reviewed previously.', 'Because tomatine
    induces antigen-specific cellular immunity in mice, it possesses remarkable potential
    as a vaccine adjuvant for infectious diseases as well as for cancer immunotherapy.',
  'By stimulating the immune system, tomatine-rich green tomatoes may also protect
    against lethal infections by foodborne pathogens such as Salmonella, as has been
    reported for potato glycoalkaloids and mushroom and herbal extracts.', 'Red tomatoes
    contain numerous health-promoting ingredients, including antioxidative carotenoids,
    anthocyanins, phenolic compounds, and flavonoids  as well as vitamins A, B, and
    C and lectins.', 'Unlike green tomatoes, which contain high levels of tomatine
    and chlorophyll but no lycopene, red tomatoes contain high levels of lycopene
    and very low amounts of glycoalkaloids.', 'The cited information on anticarcinogenic,
    anticholesterol, and other beneficial effects of tomatine suggests the desirability
    of developing new varieties of tomatine-rich red tomatoes.', 'These tomatoes would
    contain two classes of anticarcinogenic compounds:  tomato glycoalkaloids that
    stimulate the immune system, form complexes with cholesterol, and disrupt cell
    membranes and inhibit growth and metastasis of cancer cells in vivo; and  antioxidative
    lycopene that may act by suppressing free radicals that damage DNA by mechanisms
    discussed elsewhere.', This objective could be accomplished by breeding high-tomatine
    tomatoes into commercial lines or by suppressing the genes that govern the formation
    of enzymes that degrade tomatine during postharvest ripening of green to red tomatoes.,
  The cited studies suggest that plant breeders and plant molecular biologists should
    create new red tomato varieties containing high amounts of both lycopene and -tomatine.,
  It may also be possible to develop tomatine-containing potatoes by crossing high-tomatine-containing
    accessions of the wild potato Solanum acaule with cultivated Solanum tuberosum
    varieties., 'In the meantime, consumers may benefit from eating both lycopene-rich
    red and tomatine-rich green tomatoes as well as processed tomato products.', 'According
    to Wattenberg, a pioneer in chemoprevention, chemoprevention of cancer is a means
    of cancer control in which the occurrence of the disease is prevented by chemical
    compounds that can block and prevent carcinogens from reaching or reacting with
    critical tissue target sites and suppressing agents that prevent the evolution
    of the neoplastic process in cells that could otherwise become malignant.', Wattenberg
    also noted that the great chemical diversity of natural inhibitors suggests the
    possibility of selecting optimal and safe natural products for human studies.,
  These considerations stimulated worldwide interest in the development of phytomedicines
    against various types of cancer., 'The attempt of this review to integrate and
    interpret results from our studies and from studies by other investigators on
    the anticarcinogenic and other desirable activities of two bioactive tomato compounds,
    lycopene and -tomatine, is, in part, designed to prove Wattenbergs prophetic predictions.',
  The results of the cited studies suggest that both lycopene and -tomatine might
    contribute to the prevention and therapy of human cancers and possibly also cardiovascular
    diseases., 'The cited studies imply that, aside from the need to confirm in vitro
    results with corresponding studies in animals and humans, possible synergism of
    combinations of lycopene and -tomatine, both in pure form and in red and in green
    tomatoes and tomato products, is expected to provide health-promoting benefits
    that require lower concentrations of each bioactive compound.', The combination
    of a tomato-based diet with other food that has been shown to exhibit anticarcinogenic
    effects is also a major challenge for future studies., Combining bioactive food
    ingredients with other foods has the potential to elicit additive or synergistic
    anticarcinogenic effects with lower plasma levels of lycopene and tomatine., This
    is a largely unexplored area., 'For example, it would be of interest to find out
    whether different combinations of red tomatoes containing high levels of lycopene
    and green tomatoes containing high amounts of the tomato glycoalkaloid tomatine
    with, for example, the citrus compounds nobiletin and poncirin, pomegranate compounds,
    resveratrol from grapes and berries, and combinations with the rice bran ingredient
    -oryzanol, black rice bran, wheat bran, Hericium erinaceus mushrooms, cruciferous
    vegetables, jujube fruit, curcumin-containing turmeric spices, and green and black
    tea catechins and theaflavins, all of which exhibited anticarcinogenic effects
    in vivo, would be effective against breast, colon, prostate, and other cancers.',
  'Because the content of bioactive compounds in teas varies widely and storage might
    reduce their content, in vivo studies of combinations of lycopene with teas should
    use high-catechin green teas and/or high-theaflavin black teas of known composition.',
  'Such dietary combinations, in which the individual components might exert their
    anticarcinogenic effects by different mechanisms, might act as multifunctional
    foods and might make it possible to use lower amounts of lycopene and tomatine
    in the final formulations.', 'Expectations are that multiple, food-based anticarcinogens
    that elicit cell responses by different mechanisms may provide enhanced efficacy
    against a variety of cancers.', I take great pleasure in thanking Carol E. Levin
    for her assistance with the preparation of the manuscript and as well as colleagues
    for excellent scientific collaboration.]

  Lycopene, -Tomatine, and Tomatidine in Pure Form and in Fresh and Processed Tomato
