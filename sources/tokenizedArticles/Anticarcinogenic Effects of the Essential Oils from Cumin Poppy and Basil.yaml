text: ['The chemopreventive potential of three essential oils, cumin, poppy and basil
    were studied by assessing their effects on the carcinogen detoxifying enzyme,
    glutathione-S-transferase, and on 3,4-benzopyrene induced neoplasia in Swiss mice.',
  'Cumin, poppy and basil oils significantly increased glutathione-S-transferase activity
    by more than 78% in the stomach, liver and oesophagus of Swiss mice--high enough
    to be considered as protective agents against carcinogenesis.', Glutathione levels
    were also significantly elevated in these three tissues., 'The essential oils
    from cumin seeds, poppy seeds and basil leaves significantly inhibited benzopyrene
    induced squamous cell carcinoma in the stomach of Swiss mice.', These three oils
    therefore show great promise as chemopreventive agents.]
