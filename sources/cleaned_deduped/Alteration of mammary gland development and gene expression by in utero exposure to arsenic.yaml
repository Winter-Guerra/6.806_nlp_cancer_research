  Early life exposure to estrogens and estrogen like contaminants in the environment
  is thought to contribute to the early onset of puberty and consequently increases
  the risk of developing breast cancer in the exposed female. The results of this
  study show that in utero exposure to the metalloestrogen arsenite altered mammary
  gland development prior to its effect on puberty onset. In the prepubertal gland,
  in utero exposure resulted in an increase in the number of mammosphere-forming cells
  and an increase in branching, epithelial cells, and density. In the postpubertal
  gland, in utero exposure resulted in the overexpression of estrogen receptor-alpha
  that was due to the increased and altered response of the ERÎ± transcripts derived
  from exons O and OT to estradiol. These results suggest that, in addition to advancing
  puberty onset, in utero exposure to arsenite alters the pre- and postpubertal development
  of the mammary gland and possibly, the risk of developing breast cancer.'
