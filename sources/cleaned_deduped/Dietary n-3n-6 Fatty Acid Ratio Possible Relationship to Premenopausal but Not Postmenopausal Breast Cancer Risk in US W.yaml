  Recent research has suggested that an increased fatty acid intake and/or increased/(n-6)
  polyunsaturated fatty acid ratio in the diet is associated with a lower breast cancer
  risk. This case-control study investigated the association between intake of and
  other fatty acids and the/(n-6) PUFA ratio and breast cancer risk. After combining
  data from two related case-control studies in Connecticut, we had information available
  on a total of 1119 women. Cases were all histologically confirmed, incident breast
  carcinoma patients. Controls were hospital-based and population-based. Information
  on dietary intake was obtained through a validated food-frequency questionnaire.
  Standard multivariate methods were used to address the independent effects of specific
  fatty acids, fat classes and macronutrients on breast cancer risk. In the full study
  population, there were no significant trends for any macronutrient/fatty acid when
  comparing the highest to the lowest quartile of intake. When the analysis was restricted
  to premenopausal women, consumption of the highest compared with the lowest quartile
  of the/(n-6) PUFA ratio was associated with a nonsignificant 41% lower risk of breast
  cancer . A higher/(n-6) PUFA ratio was significantly associated with a lower risk
  of breast cancer when the data were restricted to the Tolland County study site;
  OR = 0.50, 95% CI 0.27, 0.95, P for trend = 0.02. These results are consistent with
  the hypothesis that a higher/(n-6) PUFA ratio may reduce the risk of breast cancer,
  especially in premenopausal women. '
