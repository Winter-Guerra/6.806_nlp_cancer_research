  Previous studies on a murine model have demonstrated that the administration of
  Lactobacillus helveticus and Lactobacillus casei inhibits the development of fibrosarcoma
  and colon carcinoma, respectively. The aim of this work was to study the beneficial
  effects of the consumption of milk fermented by L. helveticus on a murine model
  for mammary carcinoma. Female BALB/c mice were challenged by a single subcutaneous
  injection of tumoral cells in the left mammary gland. Prior to tumour injection,
  mice were fed for two, five or seven consecutive days with fermented milk. The following
  factors were monitored for 2 months: rate of tumour development, histological studies,
  apoptosis, phagocytic index, peritoneal macrophages, determination of β-glucuronidase
  enzyme in peritoneal macrophages, determination of γ-interferon and tumour necrosis
  factor-α in blood serum, determination of CD4+, CD8+, interleukin-6, IL-10, TNF-α
  and INFγ by immunoperoxidase, and measurement of β-glucuronidase activity in intestinal
  fluid. The administration of L. helveticus delayed the development of the tumour
  in all cases, a 2- or 7-day feeding period being most effective. This work demonstrates
  that milk fermented with L. helveticus decreases the growth rate of mammary tumours.
  The effect was mediated by increased apoptosis and decreased production of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines, in particular IL-6, implicated in oestrogen synthesis.'
