  effects of herbal medicines an overview of systematic reviews.md
text: '


  This overview of systematic reviews  aims to evaluate critically the evidence regarding
  the adverse effects of herbal medicines. Five electronic databases were searched
  to identify all relevant SRs, with 50 SRs of 50 different HMs meeting our inclusion
  criteria. Most had only minor weaknesses in methods. Serious adverse effects were
  noted only for four HMs: Herbae pulvis standardisatus, Larrea tridentate, Piper
  methysticum and Cassia senna. The most severe adverse effects were liver or kidney
  damage, colon perforation, carcinoma, coma and death. Moderately severe adverse
  effects were noted for 15 HMs: Pelargonium sidoides, Perna canaliculus, Aloe vera,
  Mentha piperita, Medicago sativa, Cimicifuga racemosa, Caulophyllum thalictroides,
  Serenoa repens, Taraxacum officinale, Camellia sinensis, Commifora mukul, Hoodia
  gordonii, Viscum album, Trifolium pratense and Stevia rebaudiana. Minor adverse
  effects were noted for 31 HMs: Thymus vulgaris, Lavandula angustifolia Miller, Boswellia
  serrata, Calendula officinalis, Harpagophytum procumbens, Panax ginseng, Vitex agnus-castus,
  Crataegus spp., Cinnamomum spp., Petasites hybridus, Agave americana, Hypericum
  perforatum, Echinacea spp., Silybum marianum, Capsicum spp., Genus phyllanthus,
  Ginkgo biloba, Valeriana officinalis, Hippocastanaceae, Melissa officinalis, Trigonella
  foenum-graecum, Lagerstroemia speciosa, Cnicus benedictus, Salvia hispanica, Vaccinium
  myrtillus, Mentha spicata, Rosmarinus officinalis, Crocus sativus, Gymnema sylvestre,
  Morinda citrifolia and Curcuma longa. Most of the HMs evaluated in SRs were associated
  with only moderately severe or minor adverse effects. '
