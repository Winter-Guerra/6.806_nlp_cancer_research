  The phenolic acid profile of honey depends greatly on its botanical and geographical
  origin. In this study, we carried out a quantitative analysis of phenolic acids
  in the ethyl acetate extract of 12 honeys collected from various regions in Greece.
  Our findings indicate that protocatechuic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, vanillic
  acid, caffeic acid and p-coumaric acid are the major phenolic acids of the honeys
  examined. Conifer tree honey contained significantly higher concentrations of protocatechuic
  and caffeic acid than thyme and citrus honey. p-Hydroxybenzoic acid was the dominant
  compound in thyme honeys. We further examined the antioxidant potential of the extracts,
  their ability to influence viability of prostate cancer and breast cancer cells
  as well as their lowering effect on TNF- α-induced adhesion molecule expression
  in endothelial cells. ORAC values of Greek honeys ranged from 415 to 2129 µmol Trolox
  equivalent/kg honey and correlated significantly with their content in protocatechuic
  acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, vanillic acid, caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid and their
  total phenolic content. Honey extracts reduced significantly the viability of PC-3
  and MCF-7 cells as well as the expression of adhesion molecules in HAEC. Importantly,
  vanillic acid content correlated significantly with anticancer activity in PC-3
  and MCF-7 cells. Protocatechuic acid, vanillic acid and total phenolic content correlated
  significantly with the inhibition of VCAM-1 expression. In conclusion, Greek honeys
  are rich in phenolic acids, in particular protocatechuic and p-hydroxybenzoic acid
  and exhibit significant antioxidant, anticancer and antiatherogenic activities which
  may be attributed, at least in part, to their phenolic acid content.

  Honey is a highly nutritious natural food product which has been used in various
  medicinal traditions throughout the world for its healing, antibacterial and antiinflammatory
  properties. Emerging evidence suggests that honey possesses chemopreventive, antiatherogenic
  and immunoregulatory properties as well as a great potential to serve as a natural
  food antioxidant –.


  Characterization of components in honey that might be responsible for its biological
  properties is of great interest. Honey contains about 200 substances including sugars,
  phenolic acids, flavonoids, amino acids, proteins, vitamins and enzymes . Phenolic
  compounds are considered among the main constituents contributing to the antioxidant
  and other beneficial properties of honey –. Phenolic acid profile has been determined
  in various honeys and is considered as a useful tool for determination of the floral
  origin of honey. Phenolic acids like caffeic acid and p-coumaric acid in chestnut
  honey as well as protocatechuic acid in honeydew honeys have been used as floral
  markers , . Phenolic acids are compounds with multiple biological activities, including
  anticancer, antiinflammatory, antioxidant and antiatherogenic properties. Hydroxybenzoic
  acid derivatives like p-hydroxybenzoic, protocatechuic and vanillic acid as well
  as hydroxycinnamic acid forms like p-coumaric and caffeic acid, are components with
  important anticancer activity , . Interestingly, protocatechuic and caffeic acid
  have been also shown to exhibit a significant potential as antidiabetic and cardioprotective
  agents –.


  Greece is one of the main producing countries of honey within the EU. In our previous
  study, we determined the total phenolic content and phenolic acid profile in three
  Greek honeys . In this study, we carried out a quantitative analysis of phenolic
  acids in 12 honeys from different collection regions in Greece. Furthermore we evaluated
  a) their antioxidant potential as oxygen radical absorbance capacity, b) their antiinflammatory
  activity in reducing the expression of adhesion molecules VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 in endothelial
  cells and c) their ability to influence cell viability of prostate cancer and breast
  cancer cells. We also examined possible associations between the composition of
  honeys in phenolic acids and total phenolic content with their antioxidant, anticancer
  and antiatherogenic activity.






  Twelve honey samples harvested from different regions in Greece were obtained and
  used in this study. These include four samples from commercial honeys and eight
  honey samples of different botanical origin which were provided by certified Greek
  bee-keepers. Pollen analysis through microscopic examination, characterized the
  honey samples as follows: four thyme honeys with pollen grains of Thymus capitatus
  in the range of 35% to 62%, six conifer honeys, one honey comprised of a mixture
  of wildflowers, forest and thyme and one honey from citrus. The honey floral sources
  and regions of collection are given in Table 1.










  Each honey sample was diluted with water. The solution was extracted three times
  with butanol and butanol was collected and evaporated to dryness. In order to eliminate
  the sugar content, it was further extracted with ethyl acetate. The ethyl acetate
  phase was collected and evaporated to dryness. Subsamples of dried honey extracts
  were dissolved in 50% methanol in a volumetric flask and further diluted as needed
  prior to analysis of total phenolic content, phenolic acids, hydroxy methyl furfural,
  sugars and oxygen radical absorbance capacity as described below. Subsamples of
  dried ethyl acetate honey extracts were diluted in DMSO prior to cell culture analysis.




  All cell-culture materials, such as HBSS, trypsin-EDTA solution, Dulbecco’s modified
  essential medium and FBS were obtained from Invitrogen Life Technologies. TNF-α,
  α-Tocotrienol, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-dipheny​ltetrazoliumbromide and
  the peroxidase substrate o-phenylendiamine hydrochloride were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich.
  VCAM-1 antibody and ICAM-1 antibody were purchased from R&amp;D Systems. Sheep anti-mouse
  IgG secondary antibody was purchased from Amersham. 2,2′-azobis  dihydrochloride,
  fluorescein and-6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchroman​e-2-carboxylicacid were obtained
  from Sigma-Aldrich Chemie GmbH. Gallic acid, phenolic acids, 5-(hydroxymethyl)-2-furaldehyde
  and Folin- Ciocalteu’s phenol reagent were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.




  Total phenolic content was determined by Folin-Ciocalteau method , where gallic
  acid was used as a calibration standard in photometric measurement performed by
  microplate reader.




  Ethyl acetate honey extracts in methanol solution were diluted fivefold with water,
  filtered and analyzed by HPLC connected to a diode array detector as described earlier
  . Analyses were performed on a HyperClone ODS column using the following gradient
  run with methanol and 0.3% formic acid: 90–75% B from 0 to 5 min, 75–69% B from
  5 to 20 min and 69–40% B from 20 to 40 min. The run was stopped at 65 min and post
  time was 25 min. Phenolic acids were quantified at 260 nm or 320 nm, and 5--2-furaldehyde
  at 280 nm. The authentic chemical compounds used for identification and quantification
  of phenolic acids were protocatechuic, benzoic vanillic, syringic, sinapic, trans-cinnamic,
  p-coumaric, caffeic, p-hydroxybenzoic, gallic, ferulic and chlorogenic acid.




  Oxygen radical absorbance capacity of the ethyl acetate honey extracts was analyzed
  by modified method of Huang et al.  as described in our earlier publication . Ethyl
  acetate extracts in the methanol solutions were diluted in a phosphate buffer. Blank
  and Trolox standards were also prepared in a phosphate buffer. Area under oxidation
  curve of each sample dilution was calculated and the ORAC values of ethyl acetate
  honey extracts were calculated using linear calibration curve of Trolox standard.




  Carbohydrates were analyzed by capillary electrophoresis modified from a method
  of Rovio et al. , with a P/ACE MDQ CE instrument using diode array detection at
  270 nm. Uncoated fused-silica capillaries of I.D. 25 µm and length 30/40 cm were
  used. The ethyl acetate honey extracts were injected at a pressure of 0.5 psi for
  10 s. The separation voltage was raised linearly within a 1 min ramp time from 0
  to +16 kV. Calibration curves for the quantification of glucose, fructose and sucrose
  were prepared using standard solutions with concentrations between 10 and 430 mg/L.




  Human aortic endothelial cells, MCF-7 and PC-3 were obtained as cryopreserved cells
  from European Collection of Cell Cultures and were maintained in T-75 culture flasks
  at 37°C in a humidified 95% air-5% CO2 atmosphere. HAEC were grown in endothelial
  cell growth medium M200 supplemented with 2% LSGS according to the manufacturer’s
  recommended protocol. Cells between passages 4–8 were used in this study. MCF-7
  and PC-3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s minimal essential medium supplemented
  with 10% FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. Cells were cultured
  and were split according to standard procedures.




  Cell viability was determined using the colorimetric MTT metabolic activity assay
  . MTT is cleaved in the mitochondria of metabolically active cells to form a colored,
  water-insoluble formazan salt. Briefly, breast and prostate cancer cells were grown
  in 96 flat-bottomed well plates and incubated for 48 hours with various concentrations
  of extracts. As a positive control, MCF-7 and PC-3 cells were cultured with ICI
  182780 and Doxorubicin respectively. Cells in their growth medium were used as control
  samples. After the incubation, medium was replaced with MTT dissolved in serum-free,
  phenol red-free medium, and incubation continued at 37°C for an additional 4 h.
  The MTT-formazan product was solubilized thoroughly in isopropanol and the optical
  density was measured at a test wavelength of 550 nm and a reference wavelength of
  690 nm. The absorbance was used as a measurement of cell viability, normalized to
  cells incubated in control medium, which were considered 100% viable. Cell viability
  assay was also carried out for normal endothelial cells under the same experimental
  conditions.




  To measure the cell-surface expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1, cell ELISA was conducted.
  Confluent HAEC cultured in 96-well plates were pretreated with or without honey
  extracts for 18 h and then stimulated with 1 ng/ml TNF-α for 6 hours at 37°C. Subsequently,
  cells were fixed by 0.1% glutaraldehyde in PBS for 30 min at 4°C and plates were
  blocked at 37°C for 1 h with 5% skimmed milk powder in PBS. Monoclonal antibodies
  to ICAM-1 or VCAM-1 in 5% skimmed milk in PBS were then added to the wells and incubated
  at 4°C overnight. After washing away the excess unbound primary antibody, cells
  were further incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse
  secondary antibody for 1.5 h at room temperature. The expression of cell adhesion
  molecules was quantified by the addition of the peroxidase substrate o-phenylenediamine
  hydrochloride. As a positive control we have used α-Tocotrienol, the most effective
  vitamin E analog in the reduction of cellular adhesion molecule expression and monocytic
  cell adherence . The absorption of each well was measured at 450 nm using a microplate
  spectrophotometer.




  Data is represented as mean±S.D. Statistical analysis was performed using Student’s
  t-test, two-tailed distribution, assuming two-sample unequal variance. Pearson’s
  correlation was carried out to identify relationships between phenolic acids and
  biological properties. The minimum level of significance was set at p;0.05.






  For the HPLC analysis of phenolic acids a total of 12 standards including protocatechuic,
  benzoic, vanillic, syringic, sinapic, trans-cinnamic, p-coumaric, caffeic, p-hydroxybenzoic,
  gallic, ferulic and chlorogenic acid were used. Examination of the HPLC chromatogram
  of honey ethyl acetate extracts revealed that Greek honeys are rich in phenolic
  acids. The phenolic acid pattern of the extracts was confirmed to contain protocatechuic,
  p-hydroxybenzoic, vanillic, caffeic and p-coumaric acid while gallic, ferulic, sinapic,
  syringic, trans-cinnamic and chlorogenic acid were not detected. The main constituent
  was protocatechuic acid. Protocatechuic and caffeic acid levels were higher in pine
  and fir honey when compared to thyme or citrus honey. p-Hydroxybenzoic acid was
  the dominant constituent in thyme honeys. In all samples, the amount of vanillic
  acid content ranged from 71 to 376 µg/kg honey and p-coumaric acid content ranged
  from 135 to 701 µg/kg honey.







  HPLC-DAD chromatograms obtained from honey samples and a standard mixture of phenolic
  acids and hydroxymethylfurfural. Peak identification: gallic acid; HMF; protocatechuic
  acid; p-hydroxybenzoic acid; chlorogenic acid; vanillic acid; caffeic acid; syringic
  acid; p-coumaric acid; ferrulic acid; sinapic acid; benzoic acid; trans-cinnamic
  acid.







  Table 2.  Concentration of phenolic acids and hydroxymethylfurfural detected in
  honey ethyl acetate extractsa,b.





  Hydroxymethylfurfural content ranged between 0.2–3 mg/kg in conifer tree honey and
  between 7.5–11.1 mg/kg in thyme and citrus honey. Total phenolic content of ethyl
  acetate extracts ranged from 11 to 52 mg of gallic acid/kg honey. The mean glucose
  and fructose content was 112 and 481 mg/kg honey respectively. Sucrose was not detected
  in the extracts. It is important to mention that although sugars are expressed as
  mg/kg honey, they do not represent the real amount of glucose and fructose in honey
  samples. The values concern the concentration of sugars in the ethyl acetate extracts
  and are important because the biological tests were performed with these extracts.






  Table 3.  Glucose and fructose content, total phenolic content and ORAC values of
  honey ethyl acetate extractsa,b.





  The antioxidant potential of the extracts was measured using the ORAC assay. ORAC
  values, expressed as Trolox equivalent/kg honey ranged from 619 to 2129 µmol TE/kg
  for pine and fir tree honeys and from 415 to 692 µmol TE/kg for thyme and citrus
  honeys indicating a higher antioxidant capacity for conifer tree honeys.




  TNF-α, increased the basal expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 in HAEC. α-Tocotrienol
  decreased significantly the TNF-α-induced endothelial expression of both ICAM-1
  and VCAM-1 as expected. Pretreatment of HAEC with different concentrations of honey
  extracts for 18 h followed by TNF-α stimulation for another 6 hours inhibited significantly
  ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 cell surface expression. Conifer tree honeys caused a significant
  VCAM-1 inhibition at a low concentration whereas VCAM-1 inhibition was higher at
  a concentration range 200–500 µg extract/ml. Other honeys inhibited significantly
  VCAM-1 expression only at higher concentrations. Incubation with 20–200 µg/ml of
  honey extracts did not result in endothelial cell cytotoxicity. Incubation with
  500 µg/ml of the extracts led to a 7–12% inhibition of endothelial cell viability;
  however, this percentage inhibition is considerably lower than the magnitude of
  the effect of extracts on adhesion molecule expression at this concentration.






  Figure 2.  Greek honey extracts inhibit TNF-α-induced adhesion molecule expression.


  Greek honey extracts inhibit TNF-α-induced ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 protein expression
  in HAEC. HAEC were incubated in the absence of TNF-α or compounds, with αT3, or
  with different concentrations of honey extracts for 18 h, followed by stimulation
  with TNF-α for up to 24 h. Adhesion molecules were measured by cell ELISA. Results
  are expressed as percent of control. A p&lt;0.05 value was considered statistically
  significant when compared to TNF-α-treated cells. Values represent mean ± SD based
  on three independent experiments performed in triplicate.





  The inhibitory effect of honey extracts on the viability of PC-3 and MCF-7 cells
  is shown in Figure 3A and 3B respectively. Most honeys i.e. conifer tree honey as
  well as thyme honey, caused a significant PC-3 viability inhibition at a high concentration
  whereas at a lower concentration only four honeys caused a significant cell viability
  inhibition. Similarly, most honeys significantly reduced MCF-7 cell viability at
  a high concentration. Four honeys caused a significant MCF-7 cell viability inhibition
  at a lower concentration.

  cells.


  Greek honey extracts inhibit viability of PC-3 and MCF-7 cells. Cells were incubated
  in the absence of compounds or with different concentrations of honey extracts for
  48 h. As a positive control, MCF-7 and PC-3 cells were cultured with ICI 182780
  and doxorubicin respectively. After treatment, cells were subjected to the MTT assay.
  Results are expressed as percent of control. A p&lt;0.05 value was considered statistically
  significant when compared to TNF-α-treated cells. Values represent mean ± SD based
  on three independent experiments performed in triplicate.





  As shown in Table 4, there were significant correlations between the antioxidant
  activity of honeys and protocatechuic acid content, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, vanillic
  acid, caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid as well as with the total phenolic content of
  honeys. There was also a significant correlation between VCAM-1 expression and total
  phenolic content besides protocatechuic and vanillic acid content of honeys. Vanillic
  acid content correlated significantly with MCF-7 and PC-3 cell viability inhibition.

  Honey’s beneficial health effects result from its active constituents including
  flavonoids and phenolic acids. Various honeys have been analyzed regarding their
  phenolic acid content which is rather variable and depends mainly on the floral
  and geographical origin of honey. In this study, we investigated the phenolic acid
  profile as well as the antioxidant, anticancer and antiinflammatory/antiatherogenic
  properties of twelve ethyl acetate extracts derived from Greek honeys, collected
  from different regions in Greece.


  Different extraction methods or solvents yield different concentrations of phenolic
  compounds. In our study we have used ethyl acetate extracts because ethyl acetate
  results in higher recovery of phenolic acids than diethyl ether and ethyl acetate
  extracts seem to possess higher biological activity compared to other extracts ,
  .


  HPLC analysis indicated that Greek honey ethyl acetate extracts contain high amounts
  of phenolic acids including protocatechuic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, vanillic
  acid, caffeic acid and p-coumaric acid. The most abundant phenolic acid in this
  study was found to be protocatechuic acid. To our knowledge, protocatechuic acid
  is not detectable in most of the examined honeys derived from other countries, not
  even in “active Manuka honey”, a well-known for its antibacterial properties honey
  from New Zealand which has been used as a gold standard for comparison with other
  honeys. Diethyl ether extracts from Turkish honeydew honeys only have been shown
  to contain protocatechuic acid in the range of 1639 to 5986 µg/kg honey . The presence
  of protocatechuic acid in all Greek honeys implicates its potential to be used as
  a characteristic indicator of the origin of honey. The concentrations of protocatechuic
  acid ranged from 3058 to 5967 µg/kg honey for pine honeys while in fir honeys the
  concentration ranged from 3258 to 16777 µg/kg honey. The content of protocatechuic
  acid in Greek thyme honey and citrus honey was considerably lower than in conifer
  honeys. This variation might be attributed to the botanical origin of honey. In
  agreement with our results, Haroun et al. reported the presence of protocatechuic
  acid in conifer tree honeys but not in honeys from other floral sources, supporting
  that protocatechuic acid may be used for the differentiation of conifer tree honey
  from floral honeys . The mean vanillic, caffeic and p-coumaric acid levels in Greek
  honey extracts were similar to those reported for ethyl acetate or ether extracts
  from honeys derived from other geographical regions , , . However, the mean caffeic
  acid levels in conifer honeys were significantly higher than thyme and citrus honeys.
  p-Hydroxybenzoic acid was the second most abundant phenolic acid in Greek conifer
  honey extracts, but it was the dominant phenolic acid in Greek thyme honeys. Quantitative
  analysis of phenolic acids in ethyl acetate or ether extracts from Turkish, Cuban
  and Malaysian honeys revealed that p-hydroxybenzoic acid was not among the phenolic
  acids detected , , . Our data indicate that the phenolic acid composition of Greek
  honeys differs significantly than that of honeys originated from other countries,
  implicating that geography influences the honey phenolic acid profile.


  Honey supplementation has been reported to be beneficial in diabetes mellitus .
  Evidence suggests that protocatechuic and caffeic acid are potent antidiabetic compounds
  , , which implicates that protocatechuic acid and caffeic acid may significantly
  contribute to the antidiabetic properties of honey. The current study reveals the
  unique composition of Greek conifer honey in protocatechuic acid, thus highlighting
  its utility as a potential antidiabetic agent.


  In order to decide whether a physiologically achievable serving of honey would result
  in biologically active protocatechuic acid levels we considered it important to
  take into account the following: 1) one teaspoon corresponds approximately to 20
  g of honey, 2) our quantitative analysis data indicate that 50 g of Greek conifer
  honey may contain 0.15–0.84 mg protocatechuic acid, 3) a bioavailability study in
  humans revealed that consumption of 350 ml wine containing 0.56 mg protocatechuic
  acid resulted in plasma concentration 0.2 µΜ, 4 hours after ingestion , 4) a recent
  study in mice supports that protocatechuic acid is a potent antidiabetic agent when
  plasma protocatechuic acid levels range from 0.06 to 0.13 µΜ. Importantly, protocatechuic
  acid administration to mice has been shown to increase its deposit in plasma and
  organs . Taken together, we suggest that a daily intake of 2–3 teaspoons of conifer
  honey may result in plasma protocatechuic acid concentrations with potential antidiabetic
  activity. However, clinical studies are necessary to evaluate the utility of conifer
  honey in diabetes.


  For the determination of the antioxidant activity of honey extracts we used the
  ORAC assay, which measures peroxyl radical scavenging capacity  and is widely used
  in food sector. The ORAC values of the extracts ranged between 415 and 2129 µmol
  TE/kg honey and were higher in conifer honeys than thyme and citrus honeys. The
  use of different honey fractions i.e. total honey, water soluble or organic solvent
  fractions have provided a wide range of antioxidant activity values. Comparison
  of our data with ORAC values from studies using similar fractions revealed that
  Greek honey possess high antioxidant potential; for example, ether extracted methanol
  fractions of native monofloral Cuban honeys varied from 430 to 1220 µmol TE/kg honey
  while in another study, the ORAC values for ether extracts of various monofloral
  commercial honeys from North America ranged from 110 to 900 µmol TE/kg honey , .


  Accumulating evidence indicates that honey is cardiopotective and vasoactive in
  vivo  while in vitro experiments demonstrate honey’s protective activity in a cultured
  endothelial cell line subjected to oxidative stress . However, the effect of honey
  on the inflammatory process of atherosclerosis remains unknown. In the present study,
  we have evaluated the antiinflammatory action of ethyl acetate honey extracts, by
  assessing their potential to inhibit TNF-α-induced activation of endothelial cells.
  For this purpose, cell ELISA, a widely used in vitro assay measuring the antiinflammatory
  effects of examined compounds or extracts in endothelial cells was conducted. As
  a positive control we have used α-Tocotrienol, a novel vitamin E with superior activity
  over tocopherol with regard to the attenuation of the expression of adhesion molecules.
  Incubation with Greek honey extracts caused a significant reducing effect on TNF-α-activated
  adhesion molecule expression. It is important to say that conifer tree honeys showed
  the highest inhibitory effect. These data indicate the potential of Greek honeys
  to inhibit the initial step of atherosclerotic process.


  Honey has been previously shown to protect against various types of cancer, like
  bladder, colon and breast cancer , , , , . In the present study, we demonstrate
  that Greek honey extracts caused cell death of breast and prostate cancer cell lines.
  Particularly, the ethyl acetate honey extracts inhibited significantly MCF-7 and
  PC-3 cell viability at concentrations ranging from 200 to 500 µg of extract/ml which
  correspond to 20–50% w/v of entire honey. Manuka honey has also been shown to inhibit
  significantly MCF-7 cell viability when an aqueous solution 2.5–5% w/v of entire
  honey was added to the cells . Similarly, native Tualang and Indian honey when added
  directly to cells inhibited MCF-7 cell viability showing IC50 values of 2.4 and
  4% respectively , . In another study, honey inhibited proliferation of PC-3 cells
  and IC50 concentration was 2.4% . The anticancer activity shown by our ethyl acetate
  extracts is not comparable to the activity demonstrated by the entire honey because
  entire honey is a supersaturated solution of sugars and contains more active substances
  such as other phenolic compounds embedded in sugars and terpenes , .


  Given that phenolic acids are considered strong antioxidants and known to inhibit
  cancer related pathways, we further looked for features that could account for the
  differences in the biological activities between the various honey extracts. A significant
  correlation was found between vanillic acid content and inhibition of breast and
  prostate cancer cell viability. This suggests that vanillic acid may be the major
  component responsible for the anticancer activity observed. Vanillic acid has been
  previously shown to be an effective anticancer agent in vitro . Each of the single
  phenolic acids present in the ethyl acetate extracts as well as the total phenolic
  content, were highly correlated with the ORAC values. Thus, antioxidant property
  of the extracts can be attributed, at least in part, to the presence of these phenolic
  acids. The inhibitory effect of honey extracts on TNF-α-induced VCAM-1 was also
  significantly correlated with the total phenolic content as well as with the protocatechuic
  and vanillic acid content. This is consistent with the fact that antioxidant agents
  including protocatechuic aldehyde are inhibitors of TNF-α-inducible VCAM-1 expression
  in endothelial cells .


  In conclusion, our findings suggest that Greek honeys are particularly rich in phenolic
  acids and exhibit significant antioxidant, anticancer and antiatherogenic activity.
  Greek conifer tree honeys are a rich source of protocatechuic and caffeic acid,
  implicating their beneficial use in patients with diabetes mellitus.
