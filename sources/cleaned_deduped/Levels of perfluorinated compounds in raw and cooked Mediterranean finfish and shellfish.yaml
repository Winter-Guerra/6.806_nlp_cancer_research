  of perfluorinated compounds in raw and cooked Mediterranean finfish and shellfish.md
text: '


  Perfluorinated compounds  were analyzed in several species of small Mediterranean
  fish and shellfish, all of which are popular in Greek diet. Analysis was conducted
  in raw samples and in samples cooked by the two ways preferred in Greek cuisine,
  i.e. fried in olive oil and grilled. PFCs above the detection limit were found in
  all raw samples except sardine, mussel and squid. The predominant PFC was PFOS,
  the highest concentration of which was measured in picarel. The PFOS values for
  the rest of the samples were between ;LOD and 5.66 ng g1 fw. The concentrations
  of the detected PFCs were in most cases higher after frying or grilling, this increase
  being statistically significant. Based on these results, the Tolerable Daily Intake
  for PFOS and PFOA  through consumption of fish and seafood was well below the values
  proposed by EFSA.'
