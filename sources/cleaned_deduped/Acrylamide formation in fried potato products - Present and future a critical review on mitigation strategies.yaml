  Acrylamide is proven to be carcinogenic in rodents and a probable human carcinogen,
  with increasing evidence of positive associations with human cancers. Thus, authorities
  and industry urge to find solutions for acrylamide formation, while no legal limits
  have yet been established for this contaminant in foods. Most of the acrylamide
  dietary exposure results from potato products, coffee, bakery products and chocolate.
  Acrylamide is formed in potato products during industrial processing, retail, catering
  and home preparation. This review summarizes the research to date on acrylamide
  levels, mechanisms of formation, assessment of acrylamide intake and health risk,
  and possible mitigation strategies from farm to fork in fried potato products. Furthermore,
  relevant issues regarding the implementation of mitigation strategies on an industrial
  scale are discussed and evolution of risk management summarized. In conclusion,
  lab scale studies in acrylamide mitigation research should be interpreted with utmost
  care. This leads to the pertinent question "What is the next step to reduce acrylamide
  exposure while maintaining the expected product quality for the consumer?"'
