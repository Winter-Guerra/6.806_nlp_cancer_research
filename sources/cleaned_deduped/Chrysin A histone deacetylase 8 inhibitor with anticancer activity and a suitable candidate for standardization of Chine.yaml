  health food raw material. Previous studies have shown that CP exhibits a broad spectrum
  of biological activities including anticancer, antioxidant, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory,
  and antiviral activities. The focuses of the present study were the standardization
  of CP and the possible mechanisms of its active anticancer ingredients. Nine samples
  of CP were collected from different locations in China. Analyses of the CP samples
  revealed that all 9 had similar chemical compositions. Parameters analyzed included
  the CP extract dry weight, total phenolic content, and DPPH free radical scavenging
  activities. The active anticancer ingredient was isolated, characterized against
  human MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, and identified as chyrsin, a known potent
  anticancer compound. Chrysin is present at high levels in all 9 of the CP samples,
  constituting approximately 2.52% to 6.38% of the CP extracts. However, caffeic acid
  phenethyl ester, another potent active ingredient is present in low levels in 9
  samples of CP, constituting approximately 0.08% to 1.71% of the CP extracts. Results
  from analyses of enzymatic activity indicated that chrysin is a histone deacetylase
  inhibitor and that it markedly inhibited HDAC8 enzymatic activity. In vitro analyses
  demonstrated that chrysin significantly suppressed cell growth and induced differentiation
  in MDA-MB-231 cells. In a xenograft animal model, orally administered chrysin significantly
  inhibited tumor growth. Despite the geographical diversity of the 9 samples’ botanical
  origins, their chemical compositions and several analyzed parameters were similar,
  suggesting that CP is standardized, with chrysin being the major active ingredient.
  Overall, in vitro and in vivo data indicated that chrysin is an HDAC8 inhibitor,
  which can significantly inhibit tumor growth. Data also suggested that chrysin might
  represent a suitable candidate for standardization of CP.\n\n\n\nChinese propolis;
  standardization; chrysin; histone deacetylase inhibitor; HDAC8 inhibitor\n\n\n\nPropolis
  is a natural product and resinous mixture collected by honeybees from tree buds,
  fruits, sap flows, or other botanical sources. Bees use propolis as a general sealer,
  draft excluder, antibiotic, and as an embalming substance for the carcasses of hive
  invaders. They also use propolis as a sealant for unwanted open spaces in their
  hives.(1) Currently, propolis is one of the most popular health foods in the world.
  The colors of propolis vary greatly due to its source and the season in which it
  is collected; common colors are yellow, green, brown, and black.(2) Numerous regions
  and countries of the world also use propolis as a traditional folk remedy.(2) Propolis
  has a range of chemical compositions, and it exhibits a broad spectrum of biological
  activities, including antitumor,(3) antioxidant,(4) antibacterial,(5) antiviral,(6)
  antifungal,(7) and anti-inflammatory activities.(8)\n\nPropolis contains phenolic
  and volatile compounds. Previous studies have demonstrated that the main active
  ingredients of propolis are flavonoids, phenolic compounds, and various aldehydes
  and ketones.(9) Volatile compounds such as mono- or sesquiterpenoids, prenylated
  acetophenones, and essential oils are also major chemical components. The chemical
  composition of propolis can vary according to the location of its botanical origin
  and season of collection.(10) Bankova(11) conducted pioneering research in the field
  of propolis standardization, classifying the six main types of propolis: poplar
  propolis; birch propolis; Brazilian green propolis; red propolis; pacific propolis;
  and Canarian propolis.(10) Chinese propolis is mainly classified as poplar-type
  and is predominantly distributed in Europe, China, and North America. Previous studies
  have isolated and identified several active ingredients from CP, classifying them
  into 3 structural types:(12) caffeic acid, cinnamic acid, p-coumaric acid, ferulic
  acid, and derivates, and cinnamylidene acetic acid); pinobanksin, chrysin, pinocembrin,
  and derivates; racemate flavanol,-2(3-methoxyl-4-hydroxyphenyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-2-benzpyran-5-methoxyl-3,7-diol
  and-2(3-methoxyl-4-hydroxyphenyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-2-benzpyran-5-methoxyl-3,7-diol).
  To our knowledge, this is the first study aiming to classify and/or standardize
  CP. The standardization of CP is an important issue because of its popular use as
  a health food material; approximately 350 tons per year are collected in China alone.
  The biological activities of CP are reported to include anticancer,(13) antioxidant,(14)
  and neuroprotective activities.\n\nHistone deacetylase inhibitors displayed pharmacological
  activity in several types of human cancers.(16) The histone deacetylases catalyze
  deacetylation of the ε-amino group of lysines in the N-terminal tails of histones.
  Histone acetylation and deacetylation play very important roles in the expression
  of genes of eukaryotic cells, causing chromatin remodeling.(17) The degree of acetylation
  of histones is regulated by 2 types of enzymes: the histone acetyltransferases and
  the HDACs. Previous studies have identified 11 human HDACs.(18) Imbalance in histone
  acetylation can trigger changes in chromatin conformation, leading to dysregulation
  of genes involved in cell-cycle progression, differentiation, and apoptosis.(19)
  The anticancer mechanism of HDACis is HDACi-induced hyperacetylation of core histones
  to trigger chromatin remodeling, then reactivation of silent genes, such as tumor
  suppressor genes, to suppress tumor cell growth.(20) Studies have observed HDAC
  overexpression in several human tumor types. Inhibition of the class I and II HDACs
  enzymes has a potential anticancer therapeutic strategy.\n\nIn the present study,
  we analyzed the active ingredients, chemical composition, and biological activities
  of CP collected from 9 locations. Chrysin is found to be the active ingredient in
  all samples. More importantly, we have shown that chrysin possesses anticancer properties
  due to its specificity in HDAC8 inhibition.\n\n\n\n\nChinese propolis was collected
  in late summer from 2006 to 2010. Propolis samples were obtained from 9 different
  locations in China, including Beijing, Henan, Jiangsu, Anhui, Hubei, Hunan, Guangxi,
  Gansu, and Ningxia. Samples were maintained at −20 °C before processing.\n\nFigure
  1. Map of China displaying the regions of Chinese propolis sample collection: 1,
  Beijing; 2, Henan; 3, Jiangsu; 4, Anhui; 5, Hubei; 6, Hunan; 7, Guangxi; 8, Gansu;
  and 9, Ningxia.\n\n\nAll 9 of the CP samples was alone treated and homogenized by
  stirring at 4°C. The sample was then washed 3 times with 1.0 L deionized water and
  the residue was extracted 3 times with 95% ethanol. The filtered ethanol extract
  was evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure to obtain a brown powder, which
  was stored at −20 °C until further purification.\n\n\nThe powder was dissolved in
  methanol and applied to an open silica column for the purification of chrysin. An
  n-hexane/EtOAc solvent system was used as the eluting solvent. All fractions, including
  those obtained from the chromatography procedures, were used to evaluate the effect
  on cell proliferation in human MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. The fraction possessing
  the highest antiproliferative effect, SF7, went through a second fractionation using
  the same system. Table 1displays the purification of the most active fraction. Reversed
  phase preparative high performance liquid chromatography was further performed on
  the SF7SF7 fraction. Fractions with retention times of 16.5 min were collected as
  chrysin. The conditions were as follows: column, Luna Phenomenex; solvent system,
  methanol:water; flow rate, 1.0 mL/min; detection, UV 254 nm; injection volume, 10
  μL. 1H NMR δ12.87, 10.93, 8.04, 8.03, 7.57, 7.56, 6.77, 6.56, 6.26; 13C NMR δ 183.8,
  166.2, 165.4, 164.1, 159.6, 133.5, 133.2, 131.0, 131.0, 128.1, 128.1, 107.0, 106.3,
  101.1, 95.7 data from chrysin.\n\n\nThe chemical compositions of chrysin and CAPE
  in the nine CP sample extracts were analyzed using reversed phase preparative HPLC.
  The separation conditions were as follows: column, Luna Phenomenex C18; mobile phase,
  methanol:water; flow rate, 1.0 mL/min; detection, UV 280 nm; injection volume, 20
  μL.\n\nTable 1. Antiproliferative Activity of CP Extracts and Fractions against
  Human MDA-MB-231 Breast Cancer Cells  \n\n\n\nA portion of the CP extract was fractionated
  two times by gel chromatographic analysis using silica gel. The elution solvents
  that were used were n-hexane and ethyl acetate. All fractions were analyzed by MDA-MB-231
  cells as described in detail in the Materials and Methods section.\n\n\nCells were
  treated with a fixed concentration of fraction for 72 h. The antiproliferative potency
  was evaluated: −, non-antiproliferation activity; +, 10–20% antiproliferation activity;
  ++, 30–40% antiproliferation activity; +++, 50–70% antiproliferation activity; ++++,
  80–100% antiproliferation activity.\n\n\nMDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells were
  purchased from the Food Industry Research and Development Institute. Cells were
  maintained in L-15 medium in a humidified 37 °C incubator with no CO2. Then, 3.0
  × 105 cells were seeded onto six-well plates 14 h prior to treatment. The effects
  of chrysin and CAPE on cell proliferation were examined given the various doses
  and/or multiple time-points. Trypan blue exclusion assay was used as the final readout
  for cell numbers. IC50 was defined as concentration of the test compound required
  to reduce cell viability by 50%.\n\n\nThe free radical scavenging activities of
  chrysin and CAPE were evaluated at various concentrations with 1.0 mL of 0.3 mM
  1,1-diphenyl-2-picryhydrazyl in methanol. The DPPH radical has a deep violet color
  because of an unpaired electron; its radical-scavenging capability can be detected
  spectrophotometrically by a decrease in absorbance at 517 nm, which transforms the
  deep violet DPPH radical into its pale yellow nonradical form. The mixtures of chrysin/CAPE
  and DPPH were shaken vigorously and left undisturbed at room temperature for 30
  min in the dark. Absorbance at 517 nm was measured using methanol as a blank. The
  free radical scavenging activity was indicated by EC50. Results are expressed as
  the mean ± standard deviation. The free radical scavenging activity of DPPH was
  calculated using the following equation:\n\n\nMDA-MB-231 cells in a 100-mm dish
  were treated with various concentrations of chrysin, CAPE, and suberoylanilide hydroxamic
  acid at concentration of 1.25, 2.5, and 5.0 μM for 48 h. Cells were trypsinized
  and collected in ice cold PBS. The cells were resuspended in 200 μL of PBS and fixed
  by adding 800 μL of iced 100% ethanol then incubating overnight at −20 °C. The cell
  pellets were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in 1 mL of hypotonic buffer,
  and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. One milliliter of propidium iodide solution was
  added, and the mixture was allowed to stand at 4 °C for 30 min. Cellular DNA content
  was then analyzed using FACScan cytometry.\n\n\nDetermination of the enzymatic activity
  of the HDACs 1–11 was performed by Reaction Biology Corp.. Chrysin and trichostatin
  A were tested in the platform. Both compounds were assayed in serial dilution from
  100 μM to 0.005 μM or 10 μM to 0.0005 μM. The generic substrate was a fluorogenic
  peptide from p53 residues 379 to 382 RHKK(Ac), and the HDAC8 substrate was a fluorogenic
  peptide from p53 residues 379 to 382 RHK(Ac)K(Ac). The class IIA substrate was a
  fluorogenic HDAC9 class 2A substrate Boc-Lys-AMC. The fluorescence intensity was
  measured using a fluorometric reader with excitation at 360 nm and emission at 460
  nm.\n\n\nMCF-7 cells on 100-mm dishes were treated with chrysin and SAHA at a fixed
  concentration for 1, 2, and 4 h. After treatment, cells were collected and resuspended
  in 100 μL of gold lysis buffer. Equal amounts of protein were mixed with 2× sample
  buffer and resolved by 12.5% SDS–PAGE for the detection of β-actin, p21, and Ac-histone
  3. Proteins were electrotransferred to an immobilon membrane. This was followed
  by blocking with a solution composed of 20 mM Tris-HCl, 125 mM NaCl, 0.2% Tween
  20, and 3% BSA overnight. Specific antibodies used were anti-Ac-histone 3, anti-p21,
  and anti-β-actin. These proteins were detected using chemiluminescence.\n\n\nMDA-MB-231
  cells were treated with chrysin or SAHA for 24 h. Cells were lysed, and tRNA was
  extracted using a Qiagen RNeasy Mini kit. The real time quantitative PCR primers
  were designed using Primer Express Software based on GenBank sequence data. Each
  real time quantitative PCR reaction contained 30 ng of cDNA, each primer at 100
  nM, and 7.5 μL of SYBR Green PCR Master Mix in a total volume of 15 μL. Each sample
  was tested 3 times on an Applied Biosystems Prism 7500 Fast Sequence Detection System,
  and the relative mRNA levels were calculated using the comparative threshold cycle
  method with glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as an internal control. Multiple
  PCR was performed using the following primers for humans: p21waf1 forward, 5′-CAGACCAGCATGACAGATTTC-3′,
  and reverse, 5′-TTAGGGCTTCCTCTTGGAGA-3′; CTP synthase forward, 5′-TGCAGTTGGCAGTGGTTGA-3′,
  and reverse, 5′-TGTCTACGACCACGGGATGA-3′; and GAPDH forward, 5′-ATGCTGGCGCTGAGTACGT-3′,
  and reverse, 5′-AGCCCCAGCCTTCTCCAT-3′. After the reverse transcription step at 48
  °C for 30 min, the enzyme activation reaction was performed at 95 °C for 10 min.
  Initial denaturation was performed at 95 °C for 15 s; annealing/extension steps
  were performed at 60 °C for 1 min. Forty cycles were performed.\n\n\nTwenty one
  female BALB/c nude mice were subcutaneously injected with MDA-MB-231 cells suspended
  in 2.40 mL L15/10% FBS and mixed with 0.60 mL Matrigel in a 15 mL tube. After 2
  week to 3 week of treatment, tumors were apparent in all mice. Animals were then
  allocated at random to one of 3 groups. Two groups of nude mice were orally administered
  chrysin. The other group of nude mice was treated with vehicle as the control group.
  Mice were treated every day for 42 days with chrysin or the vehicle. The tumor size
  was measured on a weekly basis and tumor weight was calculated after the mice had
  been sacrificed.\n\n\nWestern blot data were scanned using a BioImaging system.
  In each case, bands were subjected to multiple exposures to ensure that the band
  density was in the linear range. The data are presented in terms of fold change
  relative to that of the internal control for each treatment. All presented data
  were derived from 2 or 3 independent experiments with similar results.\n\n\nReal
  time quantitative PCR analysis results were presented as the mean ± SD. Student’s
  t-test was used to calculate the differences between each group and the control
  group. Statistically significant was defined as p ; 0.05.\n\n\n\n\nPrevious studies
  on CP isolated and characterized several of its biologically active components.(12)
  The present study aimed to isolate and identify the major anticancer ingredients
  of CP. Following chromatographic separation of the CP extracts, fractions were assayed
  for their effects on human MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell proliferation. Table 1
  presents the antiproliferative activities of the fractions. The SF7 fraction displayed
  higher antiproliferative activity than the other fractions. Separation of SF7 using
  a second silica column and analysis of the fractions obtained revealed SF7SF6, SF7SF7,
  SF7SF8, and SF7SF9 as potent cell growth inhibitors as shown in Table 1. HPLC was
  then applied to analyze their chemical compositions. As shown in Figure 3a, these
  fractions had a common major peak at 16.5 min. Further separation and purification
  of the SF7F7 fraction, using reversed phase preparative HPLC, collected fractions
  with retention times of 16.5 min as shown in Figure 3a. Following purification,
  the major peak, chrysin, could be isolated and identified as shown in Figure 2.\n\n\nStandardization
  of CP from Nine Samples Collected from Different Locations in China\n\nStandardization
  and characterization of propolis were two very important topics.(21) Analysis of
  the nine CP extracts using HPLC revealed that their HPLC profiles were similar,
  as shown in Figure 3b. The nine CP samples, therefore, had similar chemical compositions.
  The common major peak was chrysin, the minor peak was CAPE as shown in Figure 3b.
  The CP samples collected from Hunan, Gansu, Jiangsu, Hubei, and Henan contained
  higher levels of chrysin than the other CP samples, as shown in Table 2. The CP
  collected from Gansu contained higher levels of chrysin than CP collected from all
  other locations. The CP collected from Guangxi, however, contained lower levels
  of chrysin than CP collected from all other locations. The CP samples collected
  from Hubei, Anhui, Henan, Beijing, and Gansu contained high levels of CAPE than
  the other CP samples as shown in Table 2. The CP collected from Hunan contained
  lower levels of CAPE than CP collected from all other locations. This result shows
  that the levels of chrysin are higher than those of CAPE in these 9 samples we collected.
  On the other hand, chrysin was present at low levels in Brazilian propolis. CAPE
  was not detectable in Brazilian propolis as shown in Table 2. Despite these minor
  variations, the results indicated that chrysin might be a suitable candidate for
  the standardization of CP; it is the active ingredient and also the major substance
  occurring in CP collected from all of the sources.\n\nFigure 3. Isolation of chrysin
  and analysis of CP extracts using HPLC. Isolation and identification of chrysin
  from several fractions using HPLC. The chemical compositions of chrysin and CAPE
  in 9 samples of CP extracts were analyzed using HPLC. The conditions were Luna Phenomenex
  column; solvent system, methanol/water; flow rate, 1.0 mL/min; detection, UV 280
  nm; and injection volume, 20 μL. The details are described in Materials and Methods.\n\nTable
  2. Content of Chrysin and CAPE in CP Samples Collected from Nine Different Locations
  in China  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 3 shows the dry extract yields, total phenolic
  contents, and DPPH free radical scavenging activities of the nine different CP samples.
  The yield of dry extract ranged from 49.3% to 74.8%. CP collected from Beijing had
  a higher dry extract yield than the samples collected from other locations. The
  CP collected from Henan, however, contained a lower yield than the samples collected
  from other locations. The average dry extract yield of the nine samples was 64.1%.
  As shown in Table 3, the two standards catechin and quercetin determined the total
  phenolic content of the CP extracts. Using catachin as a standard provided, we determined
  a total average phenolic content of the CP extracts of 276.1 mg. Using quercetin
  as a standard provided a total average phenolic content of CP extracts of 248.0
  mg. The two different standards, therefore, provided similar results for total phenolic
  content. Several investigators have suggested that quercetin is an appropriate standard
  for the determination of total phenolic content of CP. The CP collected from Anhui,
  Beijing, and Gansu demonstrated the highest total phenolic content. The CP samples
  collected from Jiangsu and Hunan demonstrated the lowest total phenolic content.
  Evaluations of the DPPH free radical scavenging activities of the nine CP extracts
  identified the CP samples collected from Anhui, Beijing, Ningxia, and Gansu as displaying
  higher potency DPPH free radical scavenging activities than those of the other CP
  samples. The CP collected from Hunan and Jiangsu displayed poor antioxidant activity.
  Among the CP extracts analyzed, those with higher total phenolic content also showed
  stronger free radical scavenging activity.\n\nTable 3. Extraction of Percentage,
  Total Phenolic Content, and Radical Scavenging Activity of the Chinese Propolis
  Extracts  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValues are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation.
  CAPE was used as a positive control with EC50 at a concentration of 8.0 μg/mL.\n\n\nFigure
  4 displays the free radical scavenging activities of various concentrations of chrysin
  and CAPE,(22) presenting the EC50 values. CAPE extracts exhibited stronger free
  radical scavenging activity than chrysin. The EC50 value of CAPE was 10 μg/mL; that
  of chrysin was 16 μg/mL. Although chrysin exerts antioxidant activity, its DPPH
  free radical scavenging activity was, therefore, lower than that of CAPE.\n\nFigure
  4. DPPH free radical scavenging activity of chrysin. The free radical scavenging
  activities of various concentrations of chrysin and CAPE were measured spectrophotometrically
  with 1.0 mL of 0.3 mM DPPH in methanol.\n\n\nInvestigation of the antiproliferative
  effects of chrysin on human MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells involved the treatment
  of cells with a fixed concentration of chrysin for 24, 48, and 72 h before measuring
  the number of live cells using the trypan blue exclusion assay. As shown in Figure
  5a, MDA-MB-231 cells were sensitive to chrysin and displayed significant inhibition
  of cancer cell proliferation after treatment with chrysin for 24 to 72 h. Chrysin
  and CAPE displayed similar potencies for the inhibition of cancer cell growth after
  48 h of treatment time. After 48 h, chrysin markedly suppressed MDA-MB-231 cell
  growth in a dose-dependent manner and induced dendrite outgrowth in the MDA-MB-231
  cells. Morphological features of cell shrinkage and plasma membrane blebbing did
  not occur in chrysin-treated cells. This suggested that the cells might not have
  died and that cell growth suppression might have occurred through the induction
  of differentiation.\n\nFigure 5. Chrysin suppressed cell growth in MDA-MB-231 cells.
  The MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with a fixed concentration of chrysin for 24 h
  to 72 h. After different treatment times, the numbers of live cells were measured
  using the trypan blue exclusion assay. Cells were treated with CAPE and chrysin
  at various concentrations for 48 h, and the numbers of live cells were measured
  using the trypan blue exclusion assay. The details are described in Materials and
  Methods section. Inhibition of MDA-MB-231 cell growth following treatment with various
  concentrations of chrysin for 72 h. The treated cells displayed marked morphological
  changes. Dendrite outgrowth occurred in cells treated with chrysin at concentrations
  of 40.0 μM to 60.0 μM.\n\n\nThe trypan blue exclusion assay identified that chrysin
  significantly inhibited cell growth but did not induce cytotoxic effects in MDA-MB-231
  cells. The present study evaluated the HDAC inhibitory activity of chrysin by testing
  the enzymatic activities of HDACs following treatment with chrysin. As shown in
  Table 4, chrysin treatment inhibited only HDAC2 and HDAC8 enzymatic activities.
  The enzymatic activities of the other HDACs did not change significantly. Our data
  demonstrated that chrysin is a potent HDAC8 inhibitor with an EC50 value of 40.2
  μM. TSA is a pan-HDACi and was used as a positive control.(23) To our knowledge,
  no prior investigation has reported the HDAC inhibition property of chrysin. In
  this study, flow cytometry analyses evaluated the mechanism of chrysin-induced cell
  growth inhibition, cytotoxic effects, and regulation of the cell cycle. Treatment
  of the MDA-MB-231 cells with chrysin, CAPE, and SAHA at various concentrations for
  48 h revealed that chrysin did not significantly induce cell cycle arrest at any
  phase, nor did it induce cytotoxic effects, as indicated by the sub-G1 population.
  However, CAPE and SAHA significantly induced cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase.
  Figure 7 shows significantly increased p21(waf1/cip1) protein expression following
  chrysin and SAHA treatment. p21(waf1/cip1) is a cell cycle regulator and also a
  tumor suppressor-gene. Current reports suggested that it is a biomarker of response
  to HDACi. Results indicated that SAHA significantly upregulated Ac-Histone 3 protein
  expression. Chrysin, however, did not significantly upregulate Ac-Histone 3 protein
  expression. Previous research has demonstrated that HDAC8i had minimal effects on
  the upregulation of Ac-Histone 3 protein expression,(24) while inhibition of HDAC1,
  -2, and -3 markedly upregulated Ac-Histone 3 or Ac-Histone 4 protein expression.
  Next, quantitative PCR evaluated p21(waf1/cip1) and CTP synthase 1 gene expression
  following treatment with chrysin and suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid for 24 h. As
  shown in Figure 8, p21(waf1/cip1) gene expression was significantly upregulated
  after treatment with chrysin at concentrations of 40 μM and 60 μM. However, only
  a subtle difference was observed when treating cells with SAHA under the same condition.
  After cell treatment with chrysin and SAHA, CTPS gene expression markedly decreased
  as shown in Figure 8b. These data suggested that chrysin might function as an HDAC8
  inhibitior.\n\nTable 4. EC50 Values of the Inhibition of the Enzyme Activity of
  HDACs 1–11 by Chrysin and Trichostatin A  \n\n\n\n\nFigure 6. Effects of chrysin
  on cell cycle regulation. Flow cytometric analysis of chrysin-, CAPE-, and SAHA-treated
  MDA-MB-231 cells stained with propidium iodide as described in Materials and Methods.
  Following the flow cytometric analyses, the cellular DNA profiles were analyzed
  using Cell Quest software.\n\nFigure 7. Western blot analysis showing that chrysin
  significantly upregulated p21 protein expression. The MDA-MB-231 cells were treated
  with chrysin and SAHA for 1, 2, and 4 h. Cell lysates were prepared and subjected
  to SDS–PAGE and immunoblotting using antibodies specific for p21, Ac-histone 3,
  and β-actin.\n\nFigure 8. Regulation of the HDAC inhibitor biomarker genes p21 and
  CTPS in chrysin- and SAHA-treated MDA-MB-231 cells. Gene expression was analyzed
  using real time Q-PCR analysis. The MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with chrysin and
  SAHA at various concentrations for 24 h. The expression of p21 and CTPS HDAC inhibitor
  biomarker genes were determined using Q-PCR. The details are described in Materials
  and Methods. Student’s t-test was used for statistical analysis. The data are represented
  as the mean ± SD; p &lt; 0.05; p &lt; 0.01; P &lt; 0.001.\n\n\nImmunodeficient mice
  received a once daily oral dose of chrysin for 42 days. As shown in Figure 9a, their
  body weight did not significantly change following treatment with various doses
  of chrysin. Figure 9b shows that tumor sizes significantly decreased 2 weeks to
  6 weeks after chrysin treatment. Tumor morphologic characteristics are shown in
  Figure 9c, and Figure 9d displays the tumor weights, analyzed using Student’s t-test.
  The activity displayed by chrysin in this MDA-MB-231 cell xenograft model suggests
  that it might have potential use in the development of novel HDAC8i for targeted
  cancer therapies.\n\nFigure 9. Chrysin inhibits tumor growth in vivo after oral
  administration. Nude mice were subcutaneously injected with MDA-MB-231 cells. Chrysin
  was orally administered daily for 42 days. The body weights were measured on a weekly
  basis. Tumor sizes were determined on a weekly basis. The surgical tumor sizes and
  tumor weights were measured after the mice had been sacrificed. Student’s t-test
  was used to determine the statistical significance of differences between each group
  and the control group. Data are presented as the mean ± SD; p &lt; 0.05; p &lt;
  0.01; P &lt; 0.001.\n\n\n\nPrevious studies from our group isolated and characterized
  10 prenylated flavonoids from Taiwanese green propolis.(25-27) The present study
  is the first one to investigate CP, isolate and identify the compound chrysin in
  CP samples, and determined its chemical structure and biological activities. The
  chemical composition data from the previous studies showed that TGP contains high
  levels of propolins A to J; these have not been identified in CP previously. The
  botanical origins of TGP and CP differ; TGP is derived from Macaranga tanarius;
  and CP is from Populus nigra. The amount of TGP produced is greater than 2.0 tons
  per year, while the amount of CP produced is greater than 350 tons per year. CP
  is, therefore, produced in higher amount than TGP and plays an important role within
  the field of propolis research.\n\nIngredients from various propolis samples have
  displayed potential for use in the development of novel drugs.(28) The color of
  CP is dark brown, and its main botanical origin is the black poplar. CP contains
  typical poplar bud phenolic substances. Figure 1 shows the nine CP collection locations
  for the present study. These locations all lie within the temperate zone. Poplar
  trees are commonly distributed in the temperate regions and are rarely present in
  Taiwan. In general, the botanical origin of CP is similar to that of European propolis,
  which is also derived from the black poplar tree. CP and EP might, therefore, have
  similar chemical compositions. Standardization of CP is an important issue because
  of its popular use as a health food raw material. In this study, HPLC analysis of
  the nine different CP samples provided chemical composition profiles of the CP extracts.
  Figure 3b shows the nine different CP samples collected from different locations.
  All samples displayed the same HPLC profile, and the major peak was identified as
  chrysin. Chrysin was present at low levels in Brazilian propolis. This result suggests
  that chrysin may be as a suitable candidate for the standardization of CP. Chrysin
  can also serve as an index for distinguishing propolis collected from China or Brazil.
  CAPE, another famous active ingredient was present at low levels in nine samples
  of CP. Reports have demonstrated that CAPE was better than chrysin in several biological
  activities, including antioxidant, anticancer, and anti-inflammatory activities.
  However, CAPE is not a good candidate for the standardization of CP because CAPE
  levels from nine CP samples varies over 21.4-fold, as shown in Table 2. However,
  CAPE was present at low levels in CP; it is not a major contributor to the biological
  activity of CP extract. Although previous research has described the occurrence
  of chrysin in CP, no study has identified chrysin as a suitable candidate for the
  standardization of CP. To standardize CP, a compound must possess three key properties:
  it must be a potent active ingredient with a spectrum of biological activities;
  it must occur at high levels in all CP samples collected from different sources
  in China; and it must be chemically and physically stable. Chrysin fulfilled all
  of these conditions. Overall, results indicated that chrysin is a better candidate
  for the standardization of CP than CAPE.\n\nOn the determination of total phenolic
  content, we used two standards to evaluate the total phenolic content, as shown
  in Table 3. The data demonstrated that total average phenolic content of the CP
  extract from nine samples did not significantly differ when using these two different
  standards. In China, quercetin is an appropriate standard used by the government
  to determine the total phenolic content of CP. Next, we evaluated the DPPH free
  radical scavenging activities of the nine CP extracts. Table 3 showed that CP samples
  collected from Anhui, Beijing, Ningxia, and Gansu display higher potency of DPPH
  free radical scavenging activities compared to those of others. However, the correlation
  was poor between DPPH free radical scavenging activity and the content of chrysin
  or CAPE of the CP extract because many of the active ingredients were present in
  the CP extract as shown in Table 2. Among the CP extracts analyzed, we can find
  a correlation between higher total phenolic content and stronger free radical scavenging
  activity.\n\nChrysin is a potent antioxidant agent, anticancer agent, antiinflammatory
  agent,(29) and aromatase inhibitor.(30) This study is the first to identify a potential
  mechanism for its anticancer activity. HDAC8-specific inhibition is shown in Table
  4. The EC50 value of chrysin was 40.2 μM. As shown in Figures 5 and 6, treatment
  of MDA-MB-231 cells with 40.0 μM chrysin significantly suppressed cell growth and
  induced cell differentiation. Flow cytometric data also revealed noncytotoxic effects
  as shown in Figure 6. The US FDA approved HDACi to treat cutaneous T cell lymphoma.
  Both SAHA and FK-228 have been classified as pan-HDACis. SAHA potently and nonselectively
  inhibited HDAC1, -2, -3, -8, -6, and -10 with EC50 values in the nanomolecular range.
  Chrysin, however, is a selective inhibitor of HDAC8. Inhibition of HDAC8 activity
  might, thus, represent the mechanism by which chrysin exerts its antiproliferative
  effects on cancer cells. The enzyme HDAC8 is a class I HDAC. Class I HDACs have
  ubiquitous distribution in organs or tissues, with the exception of HDAC8. Previous
  research has identified that HDAC8 is associated with smooth muscle differentiation
  and indicated that it could potentially provide a target for brain cancer therapy.\n\nThis
  study evaluated the antitumor activity of chrysin in a nude mice xenograft model
  implanted with MDA-MB-231 cells. As shown in Figure 9, in vivo data indicated that
  mice receiving an oral dose of chrysin showed significantly suppressed tumor growth
  in comparison with that of untreated mice. A low dose of chrysin, however, did not
  significantly suppress tumor growth in comparison with that of the controls. These
  data suggest that orally administered chrysin might enter the blood circulation
  and then reach the tumor tissue, where it suppresses MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation.
  The findings further suggest the potential use of chrysin as a natural anticancer
  dietary supplement.\n\nIn conclusion, this is the first study to standardize and
  characterize CP, using chrysin as the major index compound. Data suggest that chrysin
  has HDAC8i properties and is capable of disrupting chromatin remodeling in MDA-MB-231
  cells to inhibit cancer cell proliferation. Orally administered chrysin potently
  inhibits tumor growth in mice. The mechanism by which chrysin exerts anticancer
  or antitumor activities might be the inhibition of HDAC8 enzymatic activity.\n\n\n\n\nWe
