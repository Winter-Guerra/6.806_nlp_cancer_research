  Fucoidan is a sulfated polysaccharide derived from brown algae and is known to possess
  anticancer properties. However, the relationship between fucoidan and β-catenin,
  one of the key components of the Wnt signaling pathway, in mouse breast cancer remains
  poorly characterized. In this study, mouse breast cancer cells were exposed to fucoidan
  to investigate the relationship between fucoidan and the Wnt/β-catenin signaling
  pathway in vivo and in vitro. We found that fucoidan significantly inhibited cell
  growth, increased cell death, and induced G1 cell cycle arrest in 4T1 cells. Fucoidan
  also reduced β-catenin expression and T cell factor/lymphoid-enhancing factor reporter
  activity. Furthermore, fucoidan downregulated the expression of downstream target
  genes such as c-myc, cyclin D1, and survivin. Intraperitoneal injection of fucoidan
  in tumor-bearing mice reduced the tumor volume and weight. Fucoidan induced aberrant
  downregulation of β-catenin in tumor tissues with a significant increase in apoptosis.
  Thus, our data suggested that fucoidan exerts its anticancer activity through downregulation
  of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Fucoidan may be an effective therapy for the chemoprevention
  and treatment of mouse breast cancer.'
