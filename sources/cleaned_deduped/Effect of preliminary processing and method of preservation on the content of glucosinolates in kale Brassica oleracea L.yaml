  of preliminary processing and method of preservation on the content of glucosinolates
  in kale Brassica oleracea L.md
text: '


  The aim of this work was to evaluate the level of total glucosinolates  in fresh
  kale leaves and leaves after processing, as well as in frozen, canned and dried
  products after 1-year storage. Fresh kale leaves contained 26.87 mol GLS per 1 g
  dry weight, of which aliphatic GLS comprised 63%. GLS levels in kale leaves were
  affected by blanching and cooking; losses were highest in leaves preserved by sterilization
  and lowest in frozen leaves. After 12 months of storage, mean amounts of total GLS
  in frozen and canned products were 15.59 mol and 10.73 mol respectively per 1 g.
  In dried products, mean total GLS levels ranged from 9.09 to 13.81 mol, being significantly  higher
  in freeze-dried products than in those dried by hot air. Moreover, dried products
  obtained from blanched leaves showed higher mean amounts of total GLS than those
  obtained from unblanched leaves. Frozen products from blanched material contained
  the highest amounts of GLS; total GLS were average 20% higher than in frozen products
  obtained from cooked raw material, 58%, higher than in canned products, and 47%
  higher than in dried products. Aliphatic glucosinolates were usually more stable
  than indole GLSs.'
