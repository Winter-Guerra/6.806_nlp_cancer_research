  in particular phenolic compounds, has received increasing attention from biochemists,
  pharmaceutical companies, plant breeders, and the general public due to their health
  benefits. This review focuses on the economically important Rosaceae, which contains
  varying proportions and concentrations of these compounds. The paper discusses the
  common phenolics in the Rosaceae including phenolic acids, flavonols, flavanols,
  anthocyanins, and dihydrochalcones. The nonextractable phenolics are also presented
  but not discussed in detail. The metabolism and bioavailability of phenolics, as
  well as human and environmental factors that affect their concentration and composition,
  are highlighted. Furthermore, the paper presents different approaches for biofortification
  and posits that breeding may be the most viable and sustainable option as it improves
  other fruit quality traits simultaneously and increases confidence in adoption of
  new cultivars with enhanced consumer appeal.\n\n\n\nRosaceae; phenolic acids; flavonoids;
  flavanols; anthocyanins; dihydrochalcones; nonextractable phenolics; environmental
  influence; metabolism; bioavailability; biofortification\n\n\n\nFruits, nuts, and
  vegetables have been noted to play significant roles in human health and nutrition,
  especially as sources of phytochemicals and other bioactive compounds. Among these
  plants are the Rosaceous fruit and nut crops. The Rosaceae is the 19th largest family
  of plants(1) and includes ∼95–&gt;100 genera and 2830–3100 species.(1) Of economic
  importance are members such as apple, pear, quince, almond, peach, apricot, plums,
  and cherries. The total world production of edible Rosaceous fruits in 2005 based
  on FAO statistics was ∼113 million tons.(2) At a very conservative farm gate value
  of U.S. $400 per ton, this translates to $45 billion. With the world value of almonds,
  cut roses, rose plants, and other products included, the Rosaceae could be worth
  at least $60 billion annually at the farm gate, with a consumer value of triple
  this amount, totaling ∼$180 billion.(1) Members of this family provide high-value
  nutritional foods and contribute desirable aesthetic and industrial products. Several
  studies have emphasized that Rosaceae fruits and nuts can exert a protective effect
  against human degenerative diseases such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and
  obesity.(1) This is due to their inherent richness in various phytonutrients including
  phenolic compounds.\n\nPhenolic compounds are secondary plant metabolites characterized
  by at least one aromatic ring with one or more hydroxyl groups attached. Plant phenolics
  are synthesized from carbohydrates via the shikimate and phenyl propanoid pathways
  and are generally produced as defense mechanisms against pathogens and disease organisms,
  as protection from excess ultraviolet radiation, and as attractants for pollinators.
  Complex phenolic compounds are also important structural components of plants.\n\nThe
  most important groups of phenolics in plants are the flavonoids, phenolic acids,
  lignans, and stilbenes. The flavonoid group can be subdivided into seven categories
  including flavonols, flavones, isoflavones, flavanols, flavanones, anthocyanins,
  and dihydrochalcones, of which flavonols, flavanols, anthocyanins, isoflavones,
  and dihydrochalcones are found in the Rosaceae.(3-5) The main representatives of
  flavonols, including quercetin and kaempferol, are present in glycosylated forms,
  and the associated sugar moiety is often glucose or rhamnose. Flavanols are not
  glycosylated and exist in both the monomer form and the polymer form. Catechin and
  epicatechin are the main flavanols in Rosaceous fruits and are the building blocks
  for dimeric, oligomeric, and polymeric procyanidins. Anthocyanins are pigments dissolved
  in the vacuolar sap of usually the epidermal tissues of fruits and exist in a range
  of chemical forms that are blue, red, purple, pink, or colorless according to the
  pH. Cyanidins and pelargonidins are the most common anthocyanins in foods. Dihydrochalcones
  are a family of the bicyclic flavonoids, defined by the presence of two benzoid
  rings joined by a three-carbon bridge. Phloridzin, which belongs to the dihydrochalcone
  family, is present in some Rosaceous fruits.(4, 5)\n\nTwo classes of phenolic acids
  can be distinguished including derivatives of benzoic acid and cinnamic acid. These
  acids are found in plants in both free and esterified forms with sugars and other
  organic acids.(6)Hydroxycinnamic acids are more common than hydroxybenzoic acids,
  with the main compounds of the hydroxycinnamic acid class including p-coumaric,
  caffeic, and chlorogenic acids. Hydroxybenzoic and hydroxycinnamic acids are also
  components of complex structures such as hydrolyzable tannins and lignins, respectively.\n\nStudies
  in animal subjects have demonstrated that phenolics are bioavailable and exert a
  protective role against oxidative stress and free radical damages. Oxidative damage
  triggered by free radicals can cause structural and functional alterations of cell
  macromolecules, leading to molecular mechanisms instrumental in human chronic diseases.
  Epidemiological studies have suggested that phenolic compounds such as flavonoids,
  phenolic acids, anthocyanins, and carotenoid compounds including quercetin, kaempferol,
  myricetin, p-coumaric acid, gallic acid, and ellagic acid can act as antioxidants
  and/or cancer-inhibiting compounds and thus may be involved in the prevention of
  degenerative diseases such as epithelial cancers and cardiovascular diseases, type
  II diabetes, thrombotic stroke, obesity, and neurodegenerative diseases associated
  with aging and infections.(7) Although phenolic compounds have long been studied
  for their antioxidant properties, which are now well-characterized in vitro, recent
  studies have stressed that the mechanisms of biological actions of phenolics extend
  beyond their antioxidant properties. It is now believed that phenolics may exert
  their beneficial action through modulation of gene expression and the activity of
  a wide range of enzymes and cell receptors; however, the health effects of dietary
  phenolics depend on the amounts consumed, their chemical structure, and bioavailability.(8)
  Although polyphenols are ubiquitous in Rosaceous plants, their content, distribution,
  bioavailability, and identity vary depending on genetics, fruit location, plant
  structure, preharvest and postharvest factors, and climatic conditions. In this
  review, we will discuss the common phenolic compounds identified in representative
  Rosaceae crops in five subgroups, their health benefits, and pre- and postharvest
  factors as well as climatic conditions that affect their amounts and concentrations.
  Finally, we will discuss their bioavailabilty and profer suggestions on possible
  methods for biofortification to increase consumer appeal and enhance fruit consumption.\n\n\n\nRosaceae
  is the 19th largest plant family, comprising &gt;90 genera with &gt;3000 distinct
  species and having a cosmopolitan distribution, being found just about everywhere
  except Antarctica. Four subfamilies are distinguished on the basis of fruit type
  including the Maloideae, the Prunoideae, the Rosoideae, and the Spiraeoideae. Rosaceous
  crops contribute to human health and well-being and provide an economic foundation
  for many rural communities in North America.(1, 2)\n\nIncluded in the Rosaceae family
  is a huge variety of edible fruit and nut crops as well as highly valued ornamental
  trees and shrubs. Consumers prefer a wide range of choice in their purchases of
  produce or processed foods, and the Rosaceae provides it with colorful and flavorful
  health-promoting fruits and nuts. A huge variety of textures and flavors can be
  found in fruits from this family, which can be purchased fresh or processed.(1)
  In addition to the gustatory variety provided by these crops, Rosaceous fruits provide
  a major source of dietary phytochemicals purported to promote health by mitigating
  oxidative stress and inflammation, which can ultimately lead to chronic disease.
  Some well-known antioxidants and/or cancer-inhibiting compounds that have been identified
  in the Rosaceae are ascorbic acid, quercetin, kaempferol, myricetin, p-coumaric
  acid, gallic acid, and ellagic acid.\n\nEllagic acid present in Rosaceae members
  such as strawberry, red raspberry, cloudberry, apple, pears, and other Rosaceous
  fruits has been shown to affect cell proliferation and apoptosis in human pancreatic
  adenocarcinoma cell lines, suggesting a potential anticancer role.(9) Following
  the examination of 728 men aged 65–84 years in the Zutphen Elderly Study,(10) dietary
  Rosaceous catechins were shown to have a significant effect in the reduction of
  epithelial cancer. The same study showed that tea, which contributed 87% of the
  total catechin intake, has a lesser effect in decreasing epithelial lung cancer
  when compared to apple, which contributed only about 8% of the catechin consumption.
  Furthermore, the intake of Rosaceous fruits also reduces the risk of cardiovascular
  disease. For example, the role of anthocyanins in cardiovascular disease includes
  protecting lipids from oxidant damage, thereby aiding in the prevention of cardiovascular
  vessel plaque formation, providing anti-inflammatory action, induction of nitric
  oxide formation leading to vascular dilation, etc. Prior et al.(11) reported that
  the consumption of 280 g of cherries caused a statistically significant increase
  in plasma lipophilic antioxidant capacity that was approximately 7 times greater
  compared to the control.\n\nTabak et al.(12) have demonstrated a beneficial relationship
  between consumption of catechin from solid fruit and general pulmonary health. The
  study, consisting of &gt;13000 adults in The Netherlands, observed a positive correlation
  between the consumption of solid fruit and an increase in pulmonary function/decrease
  in symptoms of COPD. A separate study of approximately 2500 middle-aged men suggested
  a strong positive correlation between apple consumption and lung function as measured
  by forced expiratory volume in 1 s.(13) Following adjustment for confounding influences
  such as smoking, body mass index, social class, and exercise, the consumption of
  fresh apple remained positively correlated with lung function, whereas the consumption
  of citrus fruit and/or fruit juices did not. Greater FEV1 of 138 mL was recorded
  for those who consumed five or more apples per week when compared to those who did
  not consume apple.\n\nConceição de Oliveira et al.(14) reported that a high intake
  of quercetin, a major component of Rosaceous fruits, was associated with a decreased
  risk of type II diabetes. In addition, intake of myricetin, common in Rosaceous
  fruits such as strawberry, may also decrease the risk of type II diabetes. Although
  evidence is limited on the protective role of cherry in diabetes, a few researchers
  have reported the role of cherry anthocyanins in reducing insulin resistance and
  glucose intolerance.(15) Sweet cherry has a relatively low glycemic index of 22
  compared to other fruits such as grapes, which scored 46. This lower glycemic index
  makes sweet cherry a potentially better fruit-based snack food for people with diabetes.\n\nCyanidins
  and malvidin, which are very abundant in sweet cherry and other Rosaceous fruits,
  have been shown to inhibit the cyclooxygenase enzymes responsible for inflammatory
  response. Thomson and Kubota(16) suggested that flavonoids and proanthocyanidin
  compounds, which are common in Rosaceous plants, in particular, cherries, might
  reduce oxidative stress and amyloid production, thereby reducing the risk of Alzheimer’s
  disease. Rosaceous fruits contain a large number of antioxidants that purportedly
  help prevent arthritis and brain dysfunctions. The accumulation of uric acid and
  other toxic substances in the body is one of the ill effects of un-neutralized free
  radicals. Consumption of Rosaceous produce, extremely abundant in antioxidants,
  can effectively help alleviate such health hazards. Memory decline and loss of limb
  control are common in older individuals due to aging of the brain and the nervous
  system, facilitated, at least in part, by the action of free radicals present in
  the system. Dietary phenolics provide an additional mechanism of neutralizing the
  effect of these oxidants, thereby serving to protect the system.\n\nA recent study(17)
  with mice implanted with aggressive breast cancer cells, MDA-MB-435, demonstrated
  an inhibition of a marker gene in the lungs after a few weeks of being fed peach
  extracts containing a mixture of phenolic compounds. This mixture of phenolic compounds
  was believed to be responsible for the tumor growth inhibition and metastasis in
  mice. The authors suggested that the dose necessary to see these effects in mice
  will be equivalent to the consumption of two to three peaches per day by humans.\n\n\n\nThe
  five major phenolic compounds including pheolic acids, flavanols, flavanols, anthocyanins,
  and dihydrochalcones will be discussed within each Rosaceous crop as follows.\n\n\nApple
  is a good source of phytochemicals including phenolic acids, anthocyanins, flavan-3-ols,
  and flavonols.(6) No wonder the saying “an apple a day keeps the doctor away”! Major
  apple phenolic acids include 3-, 4-, and 5-caffeoylquinic acid and 3-coumarylquinic
  acid with chlorogenic acid as the main phenolic acid in apple juice. Minor phenolic
  acids identified and characterized are presented in Figure 1.(5, 6, 18-20) The concentration
  of phenolic acids varies depending on cultivar, with cider varieties in general
  having a higher phenolic acid concentration than dessert apples.(18)\n\n\nThe major
  flavonols are quercetin glycosides and kaempferol and are found mainly in the peel.(18,
  21, 22) As with phenolic acids, apple cider varieties have a higher concentration
  of flavonols than dessert apples.(18) For example, the average quercetin glycoside
  content in the peel and pulp of a dessert apple is 0.5 mg/100 g, while cider apple
  peel and pulp contain 5.7 mg/100 g of quercetin glycoside.\n\n\nFlavan-3-ol compounds,
  also called flavanols, exist in both the monomer form and the polymer form in apple.
  Many such compounds exist in apple,(23, 24) and apple is a rich source of-epicatechin,-catechin,
  and procyanidin dimer B2.(24) The concentration of flavanols varies from one variety
  to the other, with cider apples having a comparatively high content of procyanidins,
  which are particularly responsible for their astringency and bitterness. Procyanidins
  are found in the whole apple fruit, and their levels gradually increase from 1232
  mg/kg in the seeds to 4964 mg/kg in the epidermal tissue of the fruit.(25, 26) The
  concentration of flavan-3-ols in apple is often affected by preparation methods.
  For example, only about 3% of the catechins are recovered in the juice, whereas
  a majority is retained in the pomace.(27) Pure juice of dessert apple contains ∼7.8
  mg/100 mL-epicatechin, whereas pure juice of cider apple contains ∼9.0 mg/100 mL-epicatechin.\n\nSome
  apple cultivars do not produce high anthocyanins in their skin except under high
  sunlight. Examples include ‘Granny Smith’ and ‘Golden Delicious’. The main anthocyanins
  are cyanin derivatives such as cyanidin 3-galactoside, cyanidin 3-glucoside, cyanidin
  3-arabinoside, and cyanidin 3-xyloside. Cyanidin 3-galactoside is the major pigment
  accounting for 80% of the total anthocyanins in apple.(28-30)\n\nStudies including
  those of Spanos et al.(31, 32) and Tomás-Barberán et al.(33) have shown that dihydrochalcone
  derivatives such as phloridzin and phloretin 2-O-(6-d-xylosyl)-d-glucoside are major
  constituents of apple. However, phloretin xylogalactoside and phloretin xyloglucoside
  are much lower in concentration. Vrhovsek et al.(34) reported 2–6% of dihydrochalcones,
  whereas Lee et al.(35) found 5.59 mg/100 g phloretin glycosides in apple fruit.
  Phloridzin is highly concentrated in the seeds, representing 98% of seed flavonoids.(36)
  Awad et al.(37) reported 10 times more phloridzin in seeds than in skin and 100
  times more than in the flesh. Gosch et al.(38) observed &gt;90% phloridzin in the
  soluble phenolic compounds extracted from apple leaves. The high concentration of
  dihyrochalcones in apple makes apple unique among the Rosaceae as very low amounts
  are found in other Rosaceous fruit.\n\n\nAlthough sweet cherry and sour cherry have
  small fruit in comparison to other Prunus species including peach, nectarine, apricot,
  plum, etc., they contain a relatively high amount of phytochemicals. Phenolic acids
  in cherries have been characterized by different authors and summarized by Macheix
  and Fleuriet(39) and are listed in Figure 1. Sweet cherry contains about 70–80%
  hydroxycinnamic acid esters(40) with neochlorogenic acid and 3′-p-coumaroylquinic
  acid being predominant. The ratio of neochlorogenic acid to 3′-p-coumaroylquinic
  acid differs among cherry cultivars as well. For example, ‘Bing’, a midseason variety,
  contains 60% neochlorogenic acid and 40% 3′-p-coumaroylquinic acid, whereas ‘Burlat’
  contains 16.5% neochlorogenic acid and 75% 3′-p-coumaroylquinic acid.(41)\n\nFlavonols,
  particularly quercetins and kaempferols, are found in high concentrations in cherry.
  Both sweet cherry and sour cherry contain a high number and concentration of flavonols
  when compared to other Rosaceous fruits, with the majority consisting of glycosylated
  quercetins and kaempferols.(42, 43) Both sour and sweet cherry share many of the
  same flavonols with differences mainly attributable to the sugar moiety of the derivative,
  for example, kaempferol-3-rhamnosyl-4′-diglucoside as opposed to kaempferol-3-rutinosyl-4′-diglucoside
  and quercetin-3-galactosyl-7-diglucoside as opposed to quercetin-3-rutinosyl-7,3′-diglucoside,
  etc..(40, 44)\n\nSweet cherry and sour cherry contain flavanols including catechins,
  epicatechins, gallocatechin, and epigallocatechin.(39) The 2013 USDA Database for
  the flavonoid content of selected food reports that catechin and epicatechin values
  of raw sweet cherries are 4.4 and 5.0 mg/100 g, respectively, which is higher than
  in pear, quince, raspberry, or strawberry.(45, 46) These results are corroborated
  in an independent study by Henning and Herrmann,(47) who reported an epicatechin
  content of 4.8 mg/100 g in sour cherry.\n\n\nDifferent authors have identified and
  characterized major anthocyanin pigments in sweet and sour cherries. The eight anthocyanins
  identified are listed in Figure 4 and consist mainly of the glucosides and rutinosides
  of cyanidin, pelargonidin, and peonidin.(40) Cyanidin-3-rutinoside is the main anthocyanin
  in sweet cherry, representing 84% of the total anthocyanins, with cyanidin-3-glucoside
  making up most of the remainder. However, a different anthocyanin profile exists
  in sour cherry. Sour cherry contains all of the anthocyanidins found in sweet cherry
  except pelargonidin-3-rutinoside, in addition to the following cyanidins unique
  to sour cherry: cyanidin 3-O-glucosyl-rutinoside, cyanidin 3-O-sophoroside, cyanidin
  3-O-arabinosyl-rutinoside, and cyanidin 3-O-gentiobioside.(48, 49) Cyanidin-3-arabinosylrutinoside
  has been detected only in ‘Balaton’ sour cherry.(50) The predominant anthocyanin
  in sour cherry is cyanidin-3-O-glucosyl-rutinoside, which represents 80% of the
  total anthocyanins(40) Generally, the skin contains higher anthocyanins than the
  pit and flesh. Gao and Mazza(42) reported that ‘Bing’ was the only sweet cherry
  containing anthocyanins in the skin, flesh, and pit, with the pit having higher
  concentrations. However, skin pigmentation may not in most cases qualify as a determinant
  of anthocyanin concentration. For example, ‘Bing’ has pigmentation in the flesh,
  whereas other cherries such as ‘Royal Ann’ and ‘Montmorency’ do not.(40) Cyanidin-3-rutinoside
  is the major anthocyanin in the skin and flesh, whereas ‘Bing’s pit contains mainly
  cyanidin-3-glucoside. Anthocyanins are absent in the flesh of ‘Montmorency’, ‘Royal
  Ann’, and ‘Rainier’ cherries. The distribution of cyanidin-3-sophoroside differs
  from that of other anthocyanins in that it is present in a higher proportion in
  ‘Montmorency’ pit than in the skin.\n\n\n\nBoth dried and fresh plums are rich sources
  of nutritive and bioactive compounds among which is phenolic acid. However, dried
  plum from prune-making varieties has higher amounts of phenolic acids than fresh
  plum due to concentration during the drying process despite partial degradation.
  Generally, plum varieties contain high quantities of hydroxycinnamic acids, especially
  neochlorogenic acid, with hydroxycinnamates constituting 86% of the total phenolic
  acids in plum.(50) Identified and characterized phenolic acids in plum and prune
  are listed in Figure 1.\n\nSultana and Anwar(51) detected 564.8 mg/kg total flavonols
  in plum, whereas Justesen et al.(52) reported 1.5 mg/100 g quercetin, 564.1 mg/kg
  myricetin, and 0.7 mg/kg kaempferol. The flavonol glycosides found in plum include
  3-glucosides, 3-galactosides, 3-rutinosides, and 3-arabinoside-7-rhamnosides of
  quercetin and kaempferol.(39) Quercetin-3-rutinoside appears to be the major quercetin,
  constituting about 2% of all phenolics in plum.(47) The major and minor contributors
  to flavonol content in plum can be found in Figure 2.\n\nThe main flavan-3-ols in
  plum are catechins, procyanidin B1, procyanidin B2, procyanidin B3, epicatechin,
  and procyanidin B4.(53) The same authors also reported the availability of A-type
  dimers and trimers in smaller concentrations. According to Donovan et al.,(54) plum
  is rich in proanthocyanidins, contributing about 70% of the total polyphenols in
  plum. Fresh plum contains flavan-3-ols in the range of 20–40 mg/kg.(55) The edible
  portion of plum has an average of 3.35 mg/100 g catechin and 2.84 mg/100 g epicatechin.(56)
  The peeled plum contains flavan-3-ols in the range of 662–1837 mg/kg.(56) The concentration
  of catechins increases with fruit development and decreases when the fruit reaches
  maturity.(57)\n\nAnthocyanins include cyanidin 3-O-rutinoside, cyanidin 3-O-glucoside,
  and peonidin 3-O-rutinoside. Anthocyanins have not been detected in prune and prune
  juice.(54) The total anthocyanin content ranges from 18 to 125 mg/100 g in fresh
  weight.(54, 58, 59) Cyanidin-3-rutinoside is predominant in plum, whereas cyanidin-3-glucoside
  and peonidin-3-rutinoside are minor, ranging between 1.9 and 13.5 mg/100 g and between
  1.1–1.2 mg/100 g, respectively.(59)\n\n\nApricot contains a significant amount of
  phenolic acids that contribute to its nutritive value. The major phenolic acids
  are 3-CQA and 5-CQA, with 5-CQA being more dominant.(60) Sochor et al.(61) also
  confirmed that 5-CQA is the principal phenolic acid. See Figure 1 for identified
  phenolic acids in apricot. Processed and unprocessed apricots share similar qualitative
  phenolic acid profiles, although lower quantities are found in the processed products.\n\nThe
  flavonols occur mostly as glucosides and rutinosides of quercetin and kaemferol,
  with quercetin 3-rutinoside being the most identified in various cultivars.(39)
  The total flavonol level in apricot was estimated at 784.8 ± 32.6 mg/kg dry weight,
  whereas the concentrations of myricetin, quercetin, and kaempferol were 406.9 ±
  16.3, 322.1 ± 6.4, and 5.8 ± 0.2 mg/kg dry matter, respectively.(51)\n\nFlavan-3-ol
  is one of the major phenolic compounds in apricot, with-catechin and-epicatechin
  being the most important flavan-3-ols.(56) The concentrations of-epicatechin in
  the fruit and jam are 4.6 and 0.5 mg/100 g, respectively, whereas-catechin concentrations
  are 3.9 mg/100 g in the fruit and 0.4 mg/100 g in the jam.(36) The fruit also contains
  procyanidin B1, procyanidin B2, and procyanidin B3.(61, 62) Processed and unprocessed
  apricots share similar qualitative profiles, although lower quantities are found
  in the processed products.\n\nThe study of anthocyanins in apricot seems relatively
  rare, because the orange color of the unblushed side of the fruit is conferred by
  carotenoids. However, a study by Bureau et al.(63) looked at anthocyanin concentrations
  during ripening in two red apricot accessions. In addition to the presence of cyanidin-3-O-rutinoside,
  these authors also found cyanidin-3-O-glucoside and peonidin-3-O-rutinoside at concentrations
  of approximately 12% each. Their study was the first to identify peonidin-3-O-rutinoside
  in apricot fruit. Figure 4 lists anthocyanins found in some apricot varieties.\n\n\nPeach
  and nectarine are similar in appearance and color, although they differ by a single
  gene for skin texture. They possess similar qualitative and quantitative phenolic
  acid profiles. Phenolic acids include chlorogenic acid, neochlorogenic acid, gallic
  acid, and caffeic acid. The major phenolic acid is 5-CQA, which is about 15.6 mg/100
  g in peach peel and cortex, 5.3 mg/100 g in peach cortex, 6.1 mg/100 g in nectarine
  peel and cortex, and 8.2 mg/100 g in nectarine cortex.(36) Peach and nectarine also
  contain a good amount of 3-CQA.(36) Lee et al.(64) reported that the concentrations
  of 5-CQA, 3-CQA, and caffeic acid decreased significantly in various peach cultivars
  sampled during the ripening process in New York state in 1987 and 1988, from a high
  at green immature stage to a level approximately 25% that value at harvest.\n\nMajor
  flavonols include quercetin glucosides and galactosides. Chang et al.(65) observed
  malvidin 3,5-O-diglucoside, quercetin 3-O-rutinoside, and quercetin 3-O-glucoside.
  These authors also reported that rutin and isoquercetin were the primary flavonols
  found in peach, particularly in the peels rather than in the flesh.\n\nPeach and
  nectarine share similar flavan-3-ol profiles including catechins, epicatechin, procyanidin
  B1, and procyanidin B2.(53)\n\nThe main anthocyanins in peach are cyanidin-3-glucoside
  and cyanidin-3-rutinoside, with the former being the most predominant.(66) Peach
  cultivars with dark red colored flesh have higher anthocyanin contents than those
  with white or yellow flesh.(67) The anthocyanin content ranges from 6.0 to 37 mg/100
  g.\n\n\nPear has a phenolic acid profile similar to that of apple, the major difference
  being the presence of arbutin and the lack of phloretin derivatives.(32) In fact,
  the presence of arbutin can be exploited as a chemical marker for pear in cases
  when suppliers might be tempted to cut apple juice with less expensive cider pear
  juice.(68) Identified and characterized pear phenolics are summarized in Figure
  1.(69) Amiot et al.(46) reported that chlorogenic acid was the major hydroxycinnamic
  ester, whereas Spanos and Wrolstad(32) found chlorogenic acid to predominate with
  caffeic acid making a respectable second-place appearance.\n\nPear contains several
  quercetins and isorhamnetins including their glycosides.(69) See Figure 2 for a
  summary of the major and minor flavonol constituents of pear.\n\nStudies have shown
  that pear contains 96% flavan-3-ol. Galvis Sánchez et al.(69) reported flavanols,
  particularly procyanidins, in the peel and not in the flesh.(46) Catechin, epicatechin,
  epigallocatechin, gallate, and proanthocyanidins have also been reported in pear.(70,
  71) Amiot et al.(46) reported concentrations of 0.6–8.7 and 0–0.5 mg/100 g for epicatechin
  and catechin, respectively, whereas Risch et al.(72) reported concentrations of
  5–60 mg/kg for epicatechin and 0–10 mg/kg for catechin.\n\nThe major procyanidins
  in ‘Bartlett’ are B1 and B2.(32) Red pear skin contains cyanidins and peonidins.(71,
  73, 74) Cyanidin-3-galactoside is the main anthocyanin in red pear with a relative
  percentage of 63% ,whereas the second main anthocyanin is peonidin 3-galactoside.(73)
  Galvis Sánchez et al.(69) reported that the peels of ‘Red D’Anjou’ and ‘Forelle’
  contain 12.0 and 1.2 mg/100 g anthocyanins, respectively. The study also confirmed
  cyanidin 3-O-galactoside as the main pigment.\n\n\nStudies have shown that quince
  is a natural source of phenolic acids.(71, 74, 75) Quince fruit is very firm, acidic,
  and astringent and not well suited to raw consumption in the human diet. In Portugal
  a major use of the fruit is in the production of jams and jellies.(76) Six phenolic
  compounds can be found in quince pulps including 3-O-, 4-O-, and 5-O-CQAs, 3,5-O-diCQA,
  and two glycosylated quercetins. Quince peel contains the same six phenolic compounds
  as the pulp plus seven flavonol derivatives, which, if detected in a jam product,
  can be used as an indicator of adulteration with unpeeled fruit.(77)\n\nThe concentration
  of phenolic acids in quince foodstuffs varies depending on the final product. According
  to the observations of Silva et al.,(77) 3-CQA can be found in quince pulp at a
  concentration of about 3.7 mg/100 g, but approximately 62% of this is lost in jam-making
  with an additional loss of 27% in jelly-making. Cryptochlorogenic acid fares a little
  better, with no significant loss from fruit to jam and a 60% loss from fruit to
  jelly. The fate of 5-CQA is similar to that of 3-CQA. With respect to 3,5-diCQA,
  only about 34% is lost from fruit to jam.(36, 77)\n\nAccording to Silva et al.(76,
  77) and Andrade et al.,(71) quince contains glycosides of quercetin and kaempferol
  and quercetin and kaempferol glycosides acylated with p-coumaric acid. Quince peel
  contains five phenolic compounds in common with the pulp, and, in addition, kaempferol
  3-glucoside, kaempferol 3-rutinoside, and several partially identified compounds
  including kaempferol glycosides, quercetin glycosides acylated with p-coumaric acid,
  and kaempferol glycosides also acylated with p-coumaric acid. Higher concentrations
  of quercetin-3-O-rutinoside are found in the peel than in the pulp.(77)\n\nNine
  flavan-3-ols, mainly-epicatechin, procyanidin B2, three procyanidin dimers and trimers,
  and one tetramer, have been identified and characterized.(78) Flavan-3-ols constitute
  between about 78 and 94% of the total polyphenolic compounds in quince.(79)\n\nUnlike
  apple, cherry, and pear, quince is low in anthocyanins. However, Markh(79) reported
  two anthocyanins in red quince, including cyanidin-3-glucoside and cyanidin-3,5-diglucosides.\n\n\nThe
  phenolic acid content of almond has been associated with astringent taste, discoloration,
  and inhibition of enzyme activity and antioxidant activities.(81) Various investigators
  have isolated and characterized phenolic acids in almond.(80-82) Most of these studies
  noted that the phenolic acid content occurs in the form of soluble esters and free
  phenolic acids.(81) It was observed that the total amount of free phenolic acid
  is ∼16.3 μg/g in the skin, whereas the total amounts of esterified phenolic acid
  in the skin, shell, and whole seed extract were ∼279.6, 167.1, and 40 μg/g, respectively.
  These phenolic acids are summarized in Figure 1(80, 81) and are mainly benzoic acid
  or cinnamic acid derivatives. Glycosides of protocatechuic acid and vanillic p-hydroxybenzoic
  acid are common in the skins.(82) The seed contains mainly rutinose- and glucose-glycosides
  of kaempferol and isorhamnetin, whereas the skin and kernel largely contain quercetin-3-O-galactoside,
  kaempferol glycosides, and isorhamnetin glycosylated with galactose instead of glucose.(82,
  83) The hulls also contain chlorogenic acid and its isomers such as cryptochlorogenic
  acid and neochlorogenic acid.(84)\n\nGlycosides of quercetin, kaempferol, and isorhamnetin
  have been identified in almond by several researchers, and their consolidated findings
  can be viewed in Figure 2.(85, 86) According to Milbury et al.,(85) the predominant
  flavonoid across eight varieties tested in their examination of California almonds
  is isorhamnetin, representing about 70% of the total, followed by catechin, kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside,
  epicatechin, quercetin-3-O-galactoside, and isorhamnetin-3-O-galactoside. The seed
  contains the majority of kaempferol- and isorhamnetin-3-O-rutinosides and glucosides,
  whereas the skin and kernel contain quercetin- and isorhamnetin- 3-O-galactoside
  in addition to the conjugates found in the seed.(86)\n\nInformation on anthocyanin
  content of almond is limited, but at least one report has suggested the presence
  of cyanidin and delphinidin.(86)\n\n\nRaspberries and strawberries contain significant
  amounts of phenolic acids. Ellagic acid and its conjugates such as ellagic acid
  arabinoside, ellagic acid acetyl-xyloside, and ellagic acid acetyl-arabinoside are
  the most predominant phenolic acids in red raspberry.(87-89) However, this is quite
  different in strawberry, where the major phenolic acids are p-hydroxybenzoic acid
  and p-coumaric acid.(90) Berries also contain ellagitannins with the highest content
  in red raspberry and strawberry.(91, 92) The ellagitanins found in raspberry include
  sanguiin H6, lambertianin C, and sanguiin H10.(36) Recent studies(93) reported two
  other compounds, bis-hexahydroxydiphenoyl-glucose and galloyl-HHDP-glucose, in four
  cultivars including ‘Jewel’, ‘Mira’, ‘Kent’, and ‘St. Pierre’. The author observed
  higher concentrations of bis-HHDP-glucose in ‘Mira’ than in other cultivars, whereas
  no significant differences were observed in galloyl-HHDP-glucose among cultivars.\n\nFlavonols
  such as quercetin and kaempferol, including their glycosides, have been reported.(87,
  90) Mullen et al.,(87) in particular, reported the presence of various quercetins
  and kaempferols in raspberry. These studies also indicated that quercetin-3-glucuronide
  was the major flavonol in red raspberry juice. The flavonol profile of strawberry
  is similar to the exception of the predominance of kaempferol and the presence of
  myricetin in strawberry. Mahmood et al.(90) also reported that kaempferol was the
  dominant flavonol in strawberry followed by myricetin and quercetin.\n\nThere is
  limited information on raspberry and strawberry flavanols. However, Määttä-Riihinen
  et al.(92) and Gu et al.(94) reported that strawberry and raspberry proanthocyanidins
  occur in the form of procyanidins and propelargonidins. Flavanols isolated and characterized
  in both strawberry and raspberry include catechins, epicatechin, procyanidin B1,
  and procyanidin B2. Lesser amounts of proanthocyanidins are found in strawberry
  compared to raspberry and other berries. De Pascual-Teresa et al.(95) and Pallauf
  et al.(96) have reported that the values of raspberry and strawberry flavanols ranged
  from 2 to 48 mg/100 g FW and from 10 to 29 mg/100 g FW, respectively.\n\nThe berries
  of Rosaceae, in particular strawberry and raspberry, are among the lowest in anthocyanin
  content compared to berries such as chokecherries, gooseberries, and blueberries.
  The anthocyanins in strawberry and raspberry are principally the glycosides of cyanidin
  and pelargonidin.(97, 98) The anthocyanins in raspberry are glycosylated with glucose,
  galactose, arabinose, or rutinose and, to a lesser extent, sophorose. Cyanidin derivatives
  are the major anthocyanins in red raspberry. The main anthocyanin in black raspberry
  is cyanidin 3-(6′-p-coumaroyl)-glucoside.(99) Pelargonidins in the form of pelargonidin
  3-O-glucoside and pelargonidin 3-O-(6′-succinyl-glucoside) are also found in strawberry.
  Borges et al.(98) identified variously glycosylated cyanidins and pelargonidins,
  along with delphinidin and malvidin, in raspberry. Cyanidin-3-O-sophoroside was
  characterized as the major anthocyanin in raspberry, at 42% of the total.\n\nThe
  anthocyanin profile in strawberry is quite different from that in raspberry, as
  the majority of strawberry anthocyanins are pelargonidins, with pelargonidin-3-glucoside
  representing 71% of the total.(97)\n\nAlthough dihydrochalcone is more common in
  apple, Hilt et al.(100) reported the presence of phloridzin in strawberry.\n\n\n\nArranz
  et al.(101-103) showed that apple and other Rosaceae crops including peach, nectarine,
  pear, and quince contain many NEPP. NEPP are a group of phenolic compounds that
  cannot be extracted using organic solvents or conventional analytical procedures
  but require acid hydrolysis of the corresponding residues to release the compounds
  from the food matrix. NEPP are mostly hydrolyzable tannins, high molecular weight
  proanthocyanidins, and phenolic acids closely associated with dietary fiber and
  protein occurring in the food matrix.(101, 104, 105)\n\nNonextractable phenolic
  acids are insoluble or associated with cell wall polysaccharides and can include
  caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid, ferulic acid, o-, m-, and p-hydroxybenzoic acid,
  sinapic acid, salicylic acid, syringic acid, and vanillic acid.(105) Although NEPP
  are not detectable using conventional procedures, studies have reported their existence
  in fruits and plant-based foods including the Rosaceae.(102, 104) NEPP as dietary
  polyphenols are not released for digestion in the intestines by mastication, stomach
  pH,and enzymatic activity;rather, they pass intact into the colon for possible fermentation
  by colonic microflora.(104) Arranz et al.(102) reported a huge gap in the content
  of NEPP and extractable polyphenols in the Rosaceae. The study showed EPP content
  of ∼18.8–28 mg/100 g in methanol/acetone/water extracts of fresh apple, peach,and
  nectarine in comparison to NEPP of ∼112–126 mg/100 g of acidic hydrolysates of the
  extraction residue from the fruit, indicating that &gt;80% of total phenolic compounds
  are left behind with conventional extraction techniques. As a specific example,
  apple gallic acid content was determined at ∼2.9 mg/100 g NEPP and ∼0.53 mg/100
  g EPP, such that almost 85% of the total of this particular phenolic acid required
  acid hydrolysis for chemical conversion to the analyte detected as gallic acid.
  The NEPP determined in the study were mainly hydroxybenzoic and hydroxycinnamic
  acids. Although NEPP are often disregarded in nutritional studies, they do contribute
  to the antioxidant activity of polyphenols through a surface reaction in the small
  intestine. As observed in different animal models, NEPP have been shown to increase
  antioxidant and antiproliferative capacities, reduce intestinal tumorigenesis,and
  modify gene expression.(104, 105)\n\nTable 1. Extractable Phenols and Nonextractable
  Polyphenols in Representative Rosaceae Crops  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVan der Sluis et al.(21)
  reported that the content of some flavonols such as quercetin glycosides, phloridzin,and
  anthocyanins in ‘Jonagold’, ‘Golden Delicious’, ‘Red Delicious’, ‘Elstar’, and ‘Cox’s
  Orange Pippin’ were not affected by 52 weeks of storage in controlled atmospheric
  conditions. The study also found that the concentration of chlorogenic acid and
  total catechins decreased slightly in ‘Jonagold’, whereas the total catechin concentration
  decreased slightly in ‘Golden Delicious’ but the chlorogenic acid concentrations
  remained stable. Furthermore, after 25 weeks of cold storage, there was no decrease
  in chlorogenic acid in any of the varieties, whereas catechins decreased slightly
  in ‘Golden Delicious’, ‘Elstar’, and ‘Cox’s Orange Pippin’. The effects of storage
  on apple peel phenolics by Golding et al.(106) confirmed that storage at 0 °C in
  air for up to 9 months has little effect on peel phenolic content. In further corroboration
  of the stability of apple peel phenolic content, Lattanzio et al.(107) studied the
  collective action of phenolic compounds for fungicidal properties in cold-stored
  ‘Golden Delicious’ apples and found no significant decrease in phenolic concentration
  after 200 days.(108)\n\nTokusoglu(108) reported variations in dihydrochalcone content
  among different apple varieties after processing into juice. In a review of studies
  conducted on polyphenolic content of whole apple compared to freshly prepared and
  commercially prepared juices, he reported a higher content and concentration of
  hydroxycinnamic acids, procyanidins, and anthocyanins in whole apple followed by
  fresh juice, fresh juice, “clear” commercial juice, and “cloudy” commercial juice.
  Anthocyanins were found in red apple peel but were not detected in the fresh or
  commercial juices tested. Chlorogenic acid, p-coumaroylquinic acid, procyanidins
  B2, procyanidins C1, epicatechin, and epicatechin were found in whole apple but
  not in apple juice. In a review of apple components and their relationship to human
  health, Hyson(109) cites work reporting a wide range of total polyphenolic contents
  in whole apple, fresh juice, and commercial juice. Depending on the variety and
  growing conditions, total polyphenolic content ranged from 5230 to 27240 mg/kg in
  freeze-dried whole apple representing 67 cultivars, from 154 to 970 mg/L in fresh
  juice, and from 110 to 459 mg/L in commercial juices.(109)\n\n\nProcessed and stored
  cherries are available year-round as frozen, whole canned, juice concentrate, etc.
  During their investigation into the changes in anthocyanins and polyphenolics during
  canning and canned storage of cherries, Chaovanalikit and Wrolstad(40) determined
  that approximately half of the anthocyanins and phenolic acids leach from the fruit
  into the syrup with minimal total loss. The proportions of cyanidin and pelargonidin
  rutinosides slightly decreased, whereas cyanidin and pelargonidin glucosides increased,
  perhaps due to partial hydrolysis of rutinose to glucose. The same investigator
  also determined that hydroxycinnamates and epicatechins were affected by storage
  and temperature, decreasing significantly after 5 months of storage at both 2 and
  22 °C. The degradation of epicatechins was found to increase significantly at 22
  °C. Flavonol glycosides were more stable, with a slight increase at 22 °C. Additionally,
  the anthocyanin and phenolic compositions of fresh frozen ‘Bing’ fruit stored at
  −23 and −70 °C for 3 and 6 months, respectively, were compared. A 67% loss of total
  anthocyanins was observed after 3 months of storage at −23 °C and an 88% loss after
  6 months. At the much lower temperature of −70 °C, only 11 and 12% losses were observed
  after 3 and 6 months, respectively.(40) In corroboration, Polesello and Bonzini(110)
  observed 34–74% anthocyanin loss in sweet cherry after 4 months of storage at −20
  °C.\n\n\nThe influence of drying parameters on the phenolic compounds in two apricot
  cultivars, Pelese and Cafona, using air temperatures of 55 and 75 °C was investigated
  by Madrau et al.(111) Relative to fresh fruit, total phenolic concentration experienced
  an across-the-board decrease. However, the study reported significantly greater
  decrease in chlorogenic acid, neochlorogenic acid, and catechin at 55 °C than at
  75 °C, which was attributed to attenuation of polyphenol oxidase enzymatic activity
  at the higher temperature. Epicatechin and quercetin 3-O-glucoside incurred greater
  losses at the higher temperature than at the lower temperature. Processed and unprocessed
  apricots share similar qualitative profiles, but lower quantities of phenolic compounds
  were found in the processed products.\n\n\nBioactive compounds in plum are degraded
  during drying, and this affects anthocyanins in particular. The polyphenolic contents
  are degraded by half in commercial prune compared to fresh plum.(54) Hydroxycinnamic
  acids,-catechin, and quercetin-3-O-rutinoside were slowly degraded as a function
  of drying time.(112) Piga et al.(113) reported the disappearance of anthocyanins
  in prune during the first month of storage. These authors also observed, in both
  fresh and dried fruits, that changes in catechins, hydroxycinnamic acids, anthocyanins,
  and flavonols were affected by both processing parameters and cultivar. Drying destroyed
  the anthocyanin compounds, and there was a significant decrease in the flavonols
  generally.\n\n\nThere are limited studies on the effect of storage and cultural
  practices on bioactive compounds in quince. However, homemade jellies showed lower
  concentrations of different phenolic compounds than commercial jams, with the exception
  of procyanidins.(114) Arbutin was identified in commercial but not in the homemade
  quince jam, suggesting adulteration of commercial jam with pear.\n\n\nIn a study
  conducted by Amaro et al.,(115) the effects of cultivar choice and storage conditions
  were investigated as they relate to the fate of anthocyanins in strawberry jams.
  Homemade jam from two cultivars, stored at room temperature with and without exposure
  to light, was analyzed for total anthocyanin content and antioxidant activity. Anthocyanin
  content and stability are critical for an attractive red color as well as antioxidant
  capacity. Although the two cultivars chosen for this study had radically different
  anthocyanin profiles, the total anthocyanin contents of each jam were similar immediately
  after preparation. However, after 15 days of storage ‘Camarosa’ jam maintained its
  anthocyanin content at approximately the 90% level, whereas that of ‘American 13’
  dropped by about 67%. After 60 days, approximately 50% of ‘Camarosa’ anthocyanins
  were quantified, whereas only about 14% of the ‘American 13’ anthocyanins were still
  detected. For both cultivars, jam stored in the dark fared just slightly better
  than jam stored with exposure to light.\n\n\nZafrilla et al.(116) conducted a study
  on the effect of processing and storage on the ellagic acid/derivatives and flavonoid
  content of raspberry jam. Ellagic acid glycosides and flavonol glycosides were found
  to be little affected by thermal processing; however, the content of free ellagic
  acid increased 2.5-fold after processing. Although a decrease in total flavonoids
  was observed, evaluation of individual phenolics in the processed jam during 6 months
  of dark storage at 20 °C showed that ellagic acid continued to increase during the
  first month of storage up to 45 mg/kg and then decreased slightly during the remaining
  storage period to a steady concentration of 20–25 mg/kg. The authors note this increase
  in free ellagic acid could be due to its chemical release from ellagitannins or
  through increased extractability afforded during processing. Quercetin glucoside
  content decreased significantly during the first 3 months from ∼66 to ∼40 mg/kg
  of fresh weight, then became stable during the rest of the storage period.(116)
  Häkkinen et al.(117) investigated the influence of processing and storage on flavonol
  content of various berries and found that quercetin was well preserved in frozen
  red raspberries during 9 months of storage at −20 °C, whereas myricetin and kaempferol
  were more susceptible to losses during storage.\n\n\nAsami et al.(118) investigated
  the impact of cold storage on total phenolics. Peach stored at 4 °C for a period
  of 14 days was measured for TP levels in peeled and unpeeled fruits on days 0, 7,
  and 14. The study showed that cold storage for 14 days resulted in no loss of TP
  activity in either the peeled or unpeeled fruit compared to fresh peach. However,
  a small increase in TP levels was observed on day 14 in peeled fruit and on days
  7 and 14 in unpeeled fruit. Peach stored in a climate-controlled temperature at
  30 °C for a period of 48 h with total phenolics measured at 0, 12, 24 and 48 h showed
  that storage for 24 h at 30 °C resulted in a 69% increase in TP in peeled fruit
  and a 36% increase in unpeeled fruit. The study showed that the levels of TP began
  to decline after 24 h, with total phenolics being 50% higher than initial levels
  in peeled fruit and 28% higher in unpeeled fruit at 48 h. This apparent counterintuitive
  discrepancy is probably a result of activation of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase in
  response to the stress of peeling; enzymes would be more active above room temperature
  such that PAL-catalyzed phenolic synthesis would cause levels in peeled fruit to
  be higher than in unpeeled fruit. The comparison of procyanidin oligomer profile
  in frozen peach and in processed peach at 104.4 °C for 10 min showed a profound
  reduction in procyanidins in canned peach relative to frozen peach. The flavonoid
  profile in canned freestone cultivars differed from that in clingstone types, as
  freestone cultivars contained higher levels of leucoanthocyanins than clingstone
  cultivars.(118)\n\n\nThe polyphenolic content of almond is affected by roasting,
  pasteurization, and storage.(119) Pasteurization did not significantly change the
  flavonoids and phenolic acids, whereas roasted almonds had 26% less total phenolics
  and 34% less flavonoids than raw almonds. Storing almond at 4 and 23 °C for 15 months
  resulted in gradual increases in phenolic acid by up to 2%. At 4 °C during 15 months
  of storage, polyphenols increased up to 18-fold for p-hydroxybenzoic acid, whereas
  other phenolic acids increased up to 45-fold.(120) The total contents of phenolic
  compounds were higher in the roasted samples than in blanched almonds. Roasting
  is the most suitable type of industrial processing of almond to obtain almond skin
  extracts with the greatest antioxidant capacity.(120)\n\n\n\nDevelopmental stage
  and environmental factors such as nutrient availability, temperature, and light
  influence the synthesis of polyphenols.(121) Treutter(122) reported that sunlight
  induces many enzymes involved in flavonoid synthesis. The effect of environmental
  factors on quercetin glycosides, phloridzin, catechins, and chlorogenic acid concentrations
  in ‘Jonagold’ and ‘Elstar’ apples has been shown to be the highest early in the
  season, decreasing to a steady level during maturation and ripening.(123) The same
  investigators reported anthocyanins decreasing midseason but rising rapidly just
  prior to maturation and quercetin glycosides being greater in fruit grown in the
  outer canopy. Awad et al.(37) also found that sun-exposed fruits had greater levels
  of anthocyanins and quercetin glycosides compared to shaded fruits, suggesting that
  exposure to sunlight affects production of these compounds. Although sunlight has
  no effect on phloridzin, catechin, and chlorogenic acid, Treutter(122) reported
  that many apple cultivars produced anthocyanins as red pigments when exposed to
  sun light. ‘Fuji’ apple grown in orchards where the ground was covered with light-reflecting
  films showed an increase in red pigmentation from 11 to 38%, which corresponds to
  an increase in anthocyanin concentrations in the peel from 0.18 to 0.37 mg/g fresh
  weight.(123) The same study also observed that the accumulation of anthocyanins
  and the concentration of flavonols in apple skin depended on the position of fruit
  on the tree.\n\nPlant nutrition also contributes to the content and distribution
  of phenolic compounds in apple varieties. Awad amd de Jager(124) found that nitrogen
  fertilization was associated with a decrease in anthocyanins, catechins, and total
  flavonoids in apple. The same author associated an increase in anthocyanins and
  total flavonoids of ‘Elstar’ apple to calcium fertilization. According to Wang and
  Lin,(125) strawberry accumulates the highest phenolic amounts when grown under compost
  substrate and full-strength fertilizer. These authors observed that the distribution
  and content of phenolic compounds such as anthocyanins, flavonols, hydroxycinamic
  acids, and ellagic acid significantly changed following fertilizer application.\n\nChemicals
  that enhance ripening can affect phytochemical biosynthesis. An example is the use
  of ethephon to increase anthocyanin production without increase in other flavonoid
  compounds and chlorogenic acid in ‘Jonagold’ apple.(126) Gibberellins, in particular,
  GA3, and-trans-2-amino-4-(2-aminoethoxy)-3-butenoic acid hydrochloride significantly
  decreased anthocyanin contents. However, application of other chemicals such as
  alar, cycocel, Prohexadione-Ca, Ga4+7, seniphos, shikimic acid, plantacur-E, and
  galactose was observed to have no effect on these phytochemicals.\n\nYearly weather
  changes can also affect thepolyphenol content of apple. Significantly higher concentrations
  of phenolic compounds in apple cultivars planted in 2006 and 2007 were observed
  by Mainla et al.(127) The study showed that 2007 plantings had higher contents of
  phenolic compounds due to longer sunlight hours, less precipitation, and a higher
  temperature in August 2007 compared to August 2006. The authors suggested that better
  light conditions in 2007 before harvest might have caused the higher polyphenol
  concentration in the apple peel.\n\nAnother factor that affects phytochemicals in
  apple as well as in other Rosaceous fruits is rootstock. According to a study in
  Estonia by Mainla et al.,(127) apples grown on vegetative rootstocks had significantly
  higher concentrations of polyphenols than those grown as seedlings. This is probably
  because rootstocks significantly influence the uptake of mineral elements from the
  soil. Other studies have also shown that the content of macronutrients in the leaves
  varies depending on rootstock.(128) Less vigorous rootstocks have a weaker root
  system and are therefore usually more susceptible to weather conditions.\n\nVarious
  studies have elucidated the effect of maturity and developmental stage on accumulation
  of phenolic compounds. Mahmood et al.(90) and Pineli et al.(129) reported that the
  total phenolic content as well as the total flavonoid content of strawberry and
  mulberry cultivars increases as fruit ripens. These studies observed that as fruit
  maturity progressed, TPC and TFC of strawberry fruit increased from ∼8.5 to ∼53.3%.
  The amount of individual phenolic acids and flavonoids in relation to different
  maturity stages varies. Major phenolic acids found in strawberry at maturity were
  p-hydroxybenzoic acid and p-coumaric acid. From unripened to fully ripened stage,
  concentrations in strawberry cultivars ranged from 21.4 to 65.4 mg/100 g DW p-hydroxybenzoic
  acid, followed by p-coumaric acid, gallic acid, ferulic acid, chlorogenic acid,
  and vanillic acid.(90) In Wang et al.’s(130) look at the influence of maturity on
  fruit quality and phenolic content in red raspberry, anthocyanins were found to
  prevail in ripe fruit, whereas ellagic acid and quercetin-3-glucuronide were the
  most abundant in green fruit. Anthocyanins increased during fruit ripening, whereas
  other polyphenols decreased significantly during fruit ripening.\n\nThe effect of
  low night temperatures on anthocyanin accumulation in grape berries has been studied
  by Mori et al.(131) The authors found that berries grown under low night temperature
  conditions accumulated up to 5.5 mg anthocyanins/g fresh weight, whereas, those
  grown during warm nights accumulated 4 mg/g fresh weight. Treutter(132) reported
  a higher accumulation of phenolic compounds in strawberry with higher day/night
  temperatures up to 30/22 °C than lower temperatures. The least accumulation of phenolic
  compounds was obtained at temperatures of 18/22 °C. Of the five phenolic compounds
  studied, pelargonidin glycosides consistently showed the highest concentration with
  increasing temperatures up to 30/22 °C, whereas kaempferol glycosides had the lowest
  concentration.\n\nThe effect of light intensity on color enhancement and higher
  anthocyanin content has been reported in raspberry.(130, 133) Wang et al.(130) showed
  that red raspberry harvested before full maturity continued to synthesize pigments
  during storage under favorable conditions, with no significant differences in color
  or total anthocyanins after 4 days. Light intensity does not affect the total phenolics
  in 50 and 80% mature fruit, but can affect immature berries.\n\nTemperature, light
  intensity, and fruit maturity affect the content and stability of phytochemicals
  in sweet cherry. Different growing temperatures affect total phenolic and anthocyanin
  contents.(134) High-temperature growing conditions significantly enhance anthocyanin
  and total phenolic content.(135) Total phenolic compounds decreased during the early
  stages of development, but later skin color development started with the accumulation
  of anthocyanins.(136) Also, rootstock affects the content and distribution of phytochemicals.(137)
  For example, ‘Lapins’ on ‘PiKu 1’ and ‘Weiroot 13’ produced significantly higher
  phenolic acid and flavonols. This could be attributed to the adjustment of the metabolism
  genetically between rootstock and scion varieties, which causes higher amounts of
  metabolic stress. Furthermore, trees of different vigors may produce sweet cherry
  fruits with different phenolic acid and flavonol contents.(138)\n\nMurray et al.(139)
  have linked plum color development to an increase in anthocyanin accumulation. Shading
  of plum fruit may reduce light intensity and will likely result in poor color development.
  Tomás-Barberán and Espin(140) reported that ultraviolet radiation is an indicator
  of anthocyanin accumulation because PAL, chalcone synthase, and dihydroflavinol
  reductase enzymes involved in phenylpropanoid metabolism are induced by UV radiation.
  Temperature differences between day and night affect anthocyanin accumulation in
  plums, and plums grown on soil covered with natural meadow have higher total phenolics
  than conventional plums(141, 142) Although Bourn and Prescott(143) suggested further
  studies to fully understand the influence of inorganic and organic fertilizers on
  the nutritional value of crops, Winter and Davis(144) disagreed that organically
  grown products are not nutritionally superior to those obtained by conventional
  agricultural techniques. Further studies are needed to confirm either of these arguments.\n\nThe
  studies of Kan and Bostan(145) on the phenolic content of organically and conventionally
  grown apricot have shown that apricot cultivars grown organically have higher-catechin
  levels than those grown conventionally. A &gt;30% decrease in epicatechin levels
  has been recorded in conventionally grown apricot, whereas higher ferrulic acid
  levels have been observed in organically grown apricot. Furthermore, the quality
  of soil and fertilizer level have pronounced effects on phenolic content. Hegedüs
  et al.(146) reported that the content of total phenolics varied during fruit ripening
  in two apricot genotypes, ‘Gonci magyarkajszi’ and ‘Preventa’. The study showed
  that there is an increase in color during ripening from green to yellow and orange
  due to significant phenolic accumulation in unripe to fully ripe fruit.\n\n\n\nBioavailable
  substances are those delivered from the digestive system to the circulatory system
  for further distribution into designated tissues and are therefore biologically
  available for biochemical functions. Phenolics, like other micronutrients, are ingested,
  digested, and then transported across the gastrointestinal epithelium into circulatory
  vessels. Bioavailability also refers to the extent to which a drug or other substance
  enters a specific tissue or organ or to the dose proportion reaching systemic circulation
  intact by alternate routes of administration to the intravenous system. Researchers
  have tried to establish that some phytochemicals can be linked to chronic diseases.(11,
  147) An important question worth asking is if these phytochemicals are in a bioavailable
  form as processed or fresh fruit. Studies have shown that anthocyanins are less
  bioavailable than flavonoids.(148) Poor anthocyanin absorption and efficiency in
  the system have been reported by Manach et al.(148) Cmax is reached between 75 min
  and 4 h after ingestion of an anthocyanin-containing meal in the plasma and at 2.5
  h in urine excretion. Most studies indicate a relatively low rate of urinary excretion
  of anthocyanins at 0.004–0.1% of the quantity ingested, although Felgines et al.(149)
  reported 5% excretion after red wine or strawberry consumption.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll
  data were converted to correspond to a supply of 50 mg of aglycone equivalent.\n\n\n\n\n\nFlavonoids
  occur as either glycosides or aglycones, with glycosides being the most common form
  in plants and foods.(150) Flavonoids are absorbed and metabolized in the small intestine
  to form methylated, glucuronidated, or sulfated metabolites in urine.(148) Flavanols
  and anthocyanins are poorly absorbed and therefore have low bioavailability, whereas
  isoflavones are the most bioavailable.(151) Many different phytochemicals are found
  in members of the Rosaceae; thus, their concentrations and bioavailability are important
  in evaluating the effect on human health. The degree to which phenolic compounds
  are bioavailable depends on factors such as cell wall digestibility of the food
  source, chemical structure of the compound, how the food source was processed, and
  the individual efficiency of the human gastrointestinal system.\n\nDetermination
  of phenolic bioavailability is done via in vitro and in vivo approaches. DuPont
  et al.(152) conducted a human study on apple phytochemical bioavailability from
  alcoholic apple cider. The study found that quercetin is not efficiently absorbed
  in humans because it was not identified in the volunteers’ plasma after administration.
  Rather, low levels of 3′-methylquercetin and 4′-methylquercetin were seen within
  60 min after drinking 1.1 L of apple cider. In their investigation into the bioavailability
  of quercetin from various foods, Hollman et al.(153) reported that glucosides of
  quercetin are more efficiently and more rapidly absorbed than quercetin or quercetin
  rutinoside, and the specific sugar moiety has a predominant effect on absorption
  profile and plasma levels of quercetin. Catechin, epicatechin, and phloridzin were
  not identified in the plasma. Bioavailability of quercetin from apple, as well as
  from pure quercetin rutinoside, was 30% of that from onion, with plasma levels peaking
  after 0.7 h for onion, 2.5 h for apple, and 9 h for the pure rutinoside. It should
  be noted that onions contain only quercetin glucosides, apples contain variously
  glycosylated quercetins, and tea contains mostly quercetin rutinoside. A separate
  study by Boyer and Liu(154) used Caco-2 colon cancer cells to ascertain the bioavailability
  of quercetin and quercetin-3-glycoside from apple peel extracts and onion extracts.
  No free quercetin was found in apple peel extracts, and no free quercetin accumulation
  was seen in the Caco-2 cells following incubation. However, low amounts of quercetin-3-glucoside
  were absorbed by the cells. The absorption of quercetin into the cells from onion
  extract was much greater, most likely due to the fact that onions contain free quercetin,
  and more quercetin glucosides, which are easily converted to the free form. Apples
  contain quercetin conjugates that are not easily hydrolyzed by lactase phloridzin
  hydrolase incubation and, so, most likely are not readily absorbed into the small
  intestine.\n\nThe studies of Fazzari et al.(155) on polyphenol bioaccessibility
  of cherry at different degrees of maturity indicated that immature cherry had high
  percentages of bioavailable phenolic compounds but lower overall concentrations.
  Higher concentrations of the readily absorbed forms of phenolic compounds in mature
  and overmature fruit made the actual bioavailable amounts of these compounds higher
  than in immature fruit. In a study to assess the bioavailability of phenolic compounds
  from five cultivars of frozen sweet cherry, fruit was digested to simulate either
  gastric or small intestine digestion and then dialyzed to determine serum-available
  and colon-available fractions. After pepsin digestion, the percentage recovery of
  the total phenolics increased, whereas the percentage anthocyanins did not change.
  With pancreatic digestion, the total phenolic available in the serum was about 26–30
  and about 77–101% in the colon. The anthocyanin content in the serum was about 15–21
  and 52–67% in colon.(155)\n\nAzzini et al.(156) studied the bioavailability of fresh
  strawberry and stored strawberry in human subjects. In the study, 13 healthy volunteers
  consumed 300 g each of FS and SS on two separate occasions. The study found that
  quercetin and anthocyanins were not found in the plasma, whereas coumaric acid,
  4-hydroxybenzoic acid, pelargonidin-3-glucoside, protocatechuic acid, and cyanidin-3-glucoside
  were detected in the plasma over a period of 8 h after ingestion of either FS or
  SS. Pelargonidin conjugates and pelargonidin aglycone peaked in the urine within
  2 h of strawberry consumption, and after 24 h, the amount excreted was approximately
  0.9% of the Pel-glc dose ingested. These results suggested that the content of phenolics
  in strawberry might influence the bioavailability of individual compounds. In raspberry,
  McDougall et al.(157) studied polyphenol bioavailability as influenced by different
  food matrices. The study showed that bioavailability patterns varied when raspberry
  was codigested with commonly combined foodstuff such as bread, breakfast cereal,
  ice cream, and cooked minced beef. Co-digestion with ice cream and cereal seemed
  to decrease phenolic bioavailability, bread had no effect, and minced beef caused
  an increase in phenolic availability. Anthocyanin bioavailability was either unaffected
  or increased by co-digestion with foodstuff, suggesting that food matrices may protect
  them from degradation during digestion.\n\nTorabian et al.(158) demonstrated that
  bioavailability of polyphenols was linked with associated reduction in plasma lipid
  peroxidation and increased antioxidant capacity following consumption of almond.
  The study reported significant increase in plasma total phenolic content 30 min
  after the consumption of 91 g of almond, whereas no changes were observed following
  an isocaloric control meal.\n\nNumerous advances in the assessment of polyphenol
  bioavailability using both in vitro and in vivo approaches have been made, but there
  is room for more studies to enable consumers to benefit from the abundant polyphenolic
  compounds in Rosaceous fruits.\n\n\n\nNutritionists, food scientists, and consumers
  have become increasingly interested in dietary polyphenols due to their role in
  human health and nutrition. A huge body of research now exists that supports the
  role of polyphenols in the prevention of degenerative diseases, including cancers,
  cardiovascular, and neurodegenerative disorders.(8-11, 159) Thus, improving the
  composition as well as the concentration of phenolic compounds in foods originating
  from plants would be a great benefit to human health through dietary intervention.
  Plant geneticists have attempted to improve phytochemical levels through traditional
  breeding or through bioengineering of PAL, leading to secondary metabolite accumulation.
  To the best of our knowledge, there is limited systematic or concerted effort in
  the Rosaceae to increase or decrease the concentrations of particular bioactive
  compounds or a group of compounds related to human health. Although there are various
  approaches for biofortification, breeding would appear to provide a more systematic
  and sustainable enrichment. We believe that initial studies on genetic improvement
  will perhaps focus on understanding the heritability of these compounds such as
  has been done in strawberry(160) and blueberry.(161) Although other methods such
  as genetic modification may seem plausible, they still have a major issue with public
  acceptance. At this stage, the technology could at best be used in the laboratory
  for testing gene function. Another potential approach is the exploitation of biotic
  and abiotic stress factors, including optimization of growth conditions such as
  light, temperature, and soil fertility, for actualization of genetic potential of
  a particular cultivar or genotype. Although it is possible to increase the content
  of these compounds by manipulating the physiology of plants using different agronomic
  treatments, it is important to consider their effects on other quality parameters
  including yield and organoleptic properties such as color, bitterness, astringency,
  and texture. To achieve this goal through breeding, gene technologies that are increasingly
  being used to accelerate breeding progress and increase efficiency would be essential.
  The use of metabolomic approaches in the identification of quantitative trait loci
  is a promising novel area. For example, metabolite analysis coupled with QTL mapping
  will offer an unprecedented opportunity to investigate and map hundreds of metabolic
  features simultaneously. These analyses will yield knowledge of the inheritance
  of complex economic traits such as polyphenols and their health-promoting compounds
  in relation to specific metabolites. Mapping key metabolites to molecular markers
  will give a detailed understanding of the genetic basis of these traits to facilitate
  incorporation into elite cultivars through marker-assisted breeding.\n\n\nWe acknowledge
