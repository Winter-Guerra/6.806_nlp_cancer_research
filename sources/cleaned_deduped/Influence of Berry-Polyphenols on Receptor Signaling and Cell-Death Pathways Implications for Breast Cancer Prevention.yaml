  Many women have become more aware of the benefits of increasing fruit consumption,
  as part of a healthy lifestyle, for the prevention of cancer. The mechanisms by
  which fruits, including berries, prevent breast cancer can be partially explained
  by exploring their interactions with pathways known to influence cell proliferation
  and evasion of cell-death. Two receptor pathways, estrogen receptor and tyrosine
  kinase receptors, especially the epidermal growth factor receptor family, are drivers
  of cell proliferation and play a significant role in the development of both primary
  and recurrent breast cancer. There is strong evidence to show that several phytochemicals
  present in berries such as cyanidin, delphinidin, quercetin, kaempferol, ellagic
  acid, resveratrol, and pterostilbene interact with and alter the effects of these
  pathways. Furthermore, they also induce cell death via their influence on kinase
  signaling. This review summarizes in vitro data regarding the interaction of berry
  polyphenols with the specific receptors and the mechanisms by which they induce
  cell death. This paper also presents in vivo data of primary breast cancer prevention
  by individual compounds and whole berries. Finally, a possible role for berries
  and berry compounds in the prevention of breast cancer and a perspective on the
  areas that require further research are presented.\n\n\n\nberries; berry polyphenols;

  and a result of the dysfunction of several regulatory features that keep the cells
  in check.(1) Although food has not been posited as a cure for cancer, several lines
  of evidence exist supporting the belief that components of food can affect the development
  of cancer in both beneficial and detrimental ways.(2, 3) The reason is the intense
  interaction of the food components with the cells at different stages during cancer
  development. Breast cancer development follows this rule as well. Healthy changes
  in lifestyle, including a better diet, may prevent up to 40% of breast cancers.(4)
  Increasing the consumption of fruits and vegetables is one part of a healthy dietary
  modification. Berries contain phytochemicals that have been shown to interfere,
  in a beneficial way, with multiple pathways linked to the development of cancer.
  These compounds are bioavailable and can potentiate each others’ effects. In addition,
  they taste good, are a part of the Western culinary repertoire, are grown locally,
  and are available year-round as fresh or frozen varieties. They are also a constant
  media presence, leading to increased awareness regarding their effects among consumers.
  A recent study reports that there is a high correlation between increased fruit
  and vegetable consumption in cancer survivors that actively seek health information
  in the media.(5) Thus, a general case can be made for the study of berries, as fruits,
  in the prevention cancer. A particular case can be made for breast cancer because
  women form a large part of the media consumers and are more likely to change their
  dietary behavior on the basis of such information. One purpose of this review is
  to present to the scientific community the evidence that is available regarding
  the benefits of berries for breast cancer prevention.\n\nThe health benefits of
  berries have been linked mostly to their antioxidant effects. Although this is an
  important contributor, berry phytochemicals also interact with other pathways, especially
  receptor signaling. In this review, we focus on two receptor signaling pathways
  known to play key roles in breast cancer development, estrogen receptor and tyrosine
  kinase receptor. These two pathways are important for bestowing proliferative potential
  to breast cancer cells and allowing the evasion of cell death. Berry phytochemicals
  can interfere with both ER and TKR signaling. They can also induce apoptotic and/or
  autophagic cell death by modulating kinase signaling, which is also involved in
  the cross-talk between ER and TKR pathways. We evaluate the in vitro data available
  in the literature for these modulations and apply it to breast cancer prevention.
  The mechanism by which well-studied compounds such as resveratrol and quercetin
  induce cell death in breast cancer cell lines is available, but there is a lack
  of such information for compounds such as cyanidin, delphinidin, and pterostilbene.
  Because there is a generality among various cell lines in how a phytochemical induces
  cell death, we present mechanistic data generated in other cell lines for the latter.
  However, we emphasize the importance of confirming these in breast cancer specific
  cell lines. We also present in vivo data available from existing animal models of
  breast cancer. Finally, we provide a perspective on how whole berries and berry
  compounds can be used for the prevention of primary and recurrent breast cancer
  and the areas of research that need to be explored further.\n\n\n\nWe begin by discussing
  the berries that are commonly consumed, the different classes of polyphenols present
  in them, and the typical plasma concentrations of these phytochemicals. It is useful
  to understand the physiological levels that can be achieved by oral administration
  to contrast it with those in in vitro studies that tend to use supraphysiological
  doses. The berries most commonly consumed in the American diet are blackberry, blueberry,
  cranberry, raspberry, and strawberry. Although they are good sources of micronutrients
  such as vitamin C and selenium, they are richer sources of polyphenols.(6) Berries
  vary greatly in their chemical composition, which is affected by agricultural and
  geographical variations as well as species. Instead of focusing on a single type
  of berry or a single polyphenol, this review will evaluate several polyphenols typically
  found in the most commonly consumed berries. We will consider five classes of polyphenols,
  anthocyanins, flavonols, tannins, stilbenes, and lignans, predominantly found in
  berries. Of these, anthocyanins are the most ubiquitous and the primary flavonoids
  responsible for the vibrant colors of berries.(7) Table 1 lists the various polyphenols
  often found in commonly consumed berries, their primary berry sources, and estimated
  levels of consumption in the U.S. population.\n\nFigure 1. Classification of berry
  phenolics and representative polyphenols from each class.\n\nTable 1. Intakes and
  Plasma Concentrations of Select Polyphenols Found in Commonly Consumed Berries  \n\n\n\nBerries
  with the highest reported content of the selected polyphenols. Neither polyphenols
  nor berries are arranged in order of specific contents.\n\n\nSome quantities have
  been converted from dry weight values using the formula 1 g dry wt = 10 g fresh
  weight for most berries.\n\n\n\n\nPlasma levels are collected from a wide variety
  of human intervention studies. They are representative of peak plasma levels and
  are not representative of U.S. population.\n\n\n\n\nCalculated from raw value 2.7
  mg/3.6 L plasma using formula μM = μg/L ÷ molecular weight of resveratrol.(126)\n\nThe
  relative abundance of various polyphenols present in berries is of the order anthocyanins
  &gt; proanthocyanins &gt; ellagitannins &gt; flavonols &gt; lignans &gt; stilbenes.
  However, the relative intake in the U.S. population is proanthocyanins &gt; flavonols
  &gt; anthocyanins &gt; ellagitannin &gt; stilbenes/lignans. This is reflective of
  the contributions from other food sources to the intake. Although proanthocyanins
  are consumed at a higher level, they are less bioavailable than anthocyanins. This
  is reflected in the peak plasma levels seen for anthocyanidins versus proanthocyanidins.
  The average intake of anthocyanins is 12.5 mg/person/day, whereas that of proanthocyanin
  is 57 mg/person/day.(8) Due to limited bioavailability and extensive clearance/metabolism
  in the body, the typical plasma concentrations of these compounds occur in the nanomolar
  range. Nevertheless, low micromolar ranges have been reported for resveratrol, quercetin,
  and enterolactone. These micromolar levels were achieved by feeding foods other
  than berries. Both the gut and the liver metabolites of these compounds play a significant
  role in mediating the physiological effects of these compounds. The important role
  of metabolites is briefly discussed later. It must be kept in mind that although
  individual compounds may affect a pathway one way, the presence of several polyphenols
  together may change these effects. In this review, we have chosen to focus on a
  select group of polyphenols and their metabolites when applicable, on the basis
  of either the abundance of the polyphenol in berries or the data available for their
  interaction with the cell-signaling pathways mentioned.\n\n\n\nThe development of
  primary and secondary neoplasia is a highly complex process involving multiple pathways
  and bidirectional cross-talk among these pathways. In this section, we discuss the
  alterations in two cell-signaling pathways known to play a role in both primary
  cancer and acquired antiestrogen-resistant secondary cancer. These are estrogen
  receptor and tyrosine kinase receptor pathways. Kinase signaling, the key connector
  of these pathways, is also discussed. The effect of individual berry phytochemicals,
  berry extracts, and whole berries on cancer cells mediated via these pathways is
  summarized. The mechanisms by which molecules of these pathways can influence cancer
  development include but are not limited to alterations in expression, activity,
  regulation by upstream and downstream molecules, phosphorylation, and epigenetic
  modifications.\n\n\nEstrogen receptors are central to the development of the normal
  mammary gland, as well as primary and secondary breast cancers. ER action in the
  breast epithelium can be classified into two: nuclear initiated steroid signaling,
  classic action via estrogen response elements and nonclassic action via AP-1, SP1,
  and other transcription factors; and membrane-initiated steroid signaling.(-9, 10)
  The complexity of how ER expression and signaling affects carcinogenesis is summarized
  in Table 2 and reviewed in ref 11. In the normal mammary gland ER-positive cells
  are fewer and do not proliferate; instead, they produce paracrine growth factors
  that signal proliferation in adjacent cells. During primary ER-positive neoplasia,
  many proliferating cells are ER+ and possibly convert paracrine to autocrine growth
  signaling. Over 70% of breast tumors diagnosed are ER+.(14) ER+ status is a key
  diagnostic criterion for the choice of AE or aromatase inhibitor treatment in patients.
  Many AE-treated tumors retain their ER expression during recurrence, but signaling
  through the ER pathway is altered in these resistant tumors.(10, 14) Thus, it is
  clear that targeting this pathway using berry polyphenols may affect the development
  of both primary and secondary cancers.\n\nFigure 2. Simplified schematic of the
  influence of berry polyphenols on cell-signaling pathways in breast cancer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeveral
  berry phytochemicals interact with the ER, and Table 3 summarizes these interactions.
  It is currently accepted that ERα plays a pro-proliferative role and is involved
  in growth-promoting actions, whereas ERβ may counteract its effects.(15-17) Most
  dietary polyphenols bind to these receptors with 100–1000-fold weaker affinity than
  estrogen.(18-20) Studies presented in Table 3 were performed using either direct
  ligand binding or ERE-reporter assays, which measure the ability of phytochemicals
  to bind to either ERα or ERβ and cause downstream effects. Polyphenols do not bind
  equally avidly to both receptors and often show preference for one or the other.
  In ligand binding assays, quercetin and kaempferol have a higher affinity for ERβ,(21-23)
  whereas resveratrol and enterolactone have a higher affinity for ERα.(24, 25) In
  breast cancer cells, anthocyanidins, cyanidin, delphinidin, and pelargonidin, bind
  to ERs and significantly reduce 17β estradiol-induced ERE-luciferase expression,
  acting like an antiestrogen.(26) However, whether they preferentially bind to ERα
  or ERβ is not reported. In HeLa cells transfected with either ERα or ERβ, ellagic
  acid acts like an estrogen in ERα-transfected cells, but like an antiestrogen in
  ERβ cells.(27) In MCF-7 cells, metabolites of ellagic acid, urolithins A and B,
  bind avidly to ERα and ERβ, respectively.(28) This suggests that the effect of ellagic
  acid on the tissue may be dependent on the type of ER primarily expressed and also
  on the metabolite generated. Many of these phytochemicals are agonists of ER, in
  that they can induce cell proliferation in MCF-7 cells in the absence of E2. However,
  in the presence of E2, they antagonize E2 action, thus acting as antiestrogens.(28)
  In such in vitro studies, the dose used may have a specific effect on the outcome.
  For example, if a particular polyphenol is used at a very high concentration in
  culture, it could simply compete for the receptor and displace E2, the natural ligand,
  resulting in an antiestrogenic activity. Quercetin, kaempferol, and resveratrol
  show distinct dose-dependent biphasic effects. It has been postulated that because
  these compounds bind to ERβ with a greater affinity than to ERα their growth-retarding
  effects are ERβ-mediated.(21, 24) However, quercetin stimulates MCF7 cell proliferation
  at 10 μM, whereas it inhibits it significantly at 100 μM,(22) supporting our theory
  of dose-dependent displacement of the natural ligand.\n\n\n\n\nCell line origins:
  breast, MCF-7, MDA-MB-231; cervical, HeLa; endometrial, Ishikawa. ER, estrogen receptor;
  ERE, estrogen receptor response elements; PGR, progesterone receptor; IRS1, insulin
  receptor substrate 1; IGFBP3, insulin like growth factor binding protein-3; VEGF,
  vascular endothelial growth factors.\n\n\nUrolithins A and B are gut metabolites
  of ellagic acid, and enterolactone is a gut metabolite of lignans.\n\nThere is evidence
  to suggest than many of these phytochemicals act as selective estrogen receptor
  modulators similar to Tamoxifen and its active metabolite 4-hydroxytamoxifen. TAM/4-OHT
  can act as an agonist in the absence of E2 and as an antagonist in its presence.(14)
  Furthermore, similar to 4-OHT, these compounds bind to ERβ with a higher affinity
  than to ERα.(29) In addition, several berry phytochemicals can act as pure agonists
  in cell types other than mammary epithelial cells.(27, 30, 31) Many studies have
  blocked ER activity using either 4-OHT or ICI 182,780 to show that the effect of
  these phytochemicals is ER-mediated.(26, 27, 32) However, data on whether these
  compounds antagonize, synergize, or potentiate the effects of AE in breast cancer
  cells are very limited. Our preliminary data show that ellagitannin–punicalagin
  and ellagic acid cause a synergistic cytotoxicity in combination with subtoxic levels
  of 4-OHT and ICI in MCF-7 cells. We know of no such information for other berry
  compounds or their respective metabolites.\n\nCoregulators are molecules that either
  potentiate or repress the transcriptional activity of the steroid receptors. Very
  few data are available on whether polyphenols modulate the selective recruitment
  of coregulators to ERα or ERβ. It can be inferred from Klinge et al.(33) that the
  estrogenic action of resveratrol requires coregulator recruitment because resveratrol
  fails to elicit a response in a yeast expression system but shows a dose-dependent
  activation of ERβ in mammalian cells. Indeed, resveratrol does differentially recruit
  ER coactivators SRC-1 and GRIP-1 to either ERα or ERβ depending on the dose used.
  At a dose of 1–10 μM, it preferentially recruits SRC-1 to ERβ.(24) This effect is
  not seen at 100 μM, at which dose it does not recruit either coactivator to ERα
  or ERβ. At this dose, it simply acts as an ER antagonist. Such results underscore
  the importance of using physiological concentrations in culture to glean mechanistic
  insights. Regardless, the effect of berry polyphenols on differential recruitment
  of coregulators to the ER is an area that still needs much research.\n\nThe effect
  of berry polyphenols on ER signaling is a sum of several mechanisms such as direct
  interaction with receptor, specificity for receptor isoform, competition with ligand
  for receptor binding, and differential recruitment of coregulators. The mechanism
  likely varies depending on the cell type, dose, and the polyphenol involved. Given
  that pharmaceutical agents used for endocrine therapy of breast cancer such as TAM
  and ICI often utilize similar mechanisms, it is important to study the drug–nutrient
  interaction and how this may affect the outcome of treatment.\n\n\n\nMembrane growth
  factors are activated by extracellular ligands and activate targets through phosphorylation
  of upstream kinases, which then leads to activation of downstream transcription
  factors. One of their functions during normal development is to stimulate cell proliferation
  in response to external growth factors.(12) In breast cancer, GFRs become overactivated
  via gene amplification, chromosome translocation, and mutations, leading to a constant
  stimulation of cell proliferation. Although many members of GFR signaling affect
  mammary tumorigenesis, the epidermal growth factor receptor family in particular
  is discussed here. The EGFR family consists of EGFR, HER2/ErbB2, HER3/ErbB3, and
  HER4/ErbB4, and the activation of downstream targets depends on the dimerization
  of any two members of the family in response to ligand binding. Expression of EGFR
  is increased in 30–60% of triple-negative breast cancers.(12) Growth factor signaling
  induces the nongenomic activation of the ER pathway by phosphorylation of both the
  ER and its cofactors.(34, 35) This cross-talk between GFR and ER pathways, facilitated
  via the kinase signaling cascade, is thought to play an important role in conferring
  TAM resistance. Inhibition of this cross-talk using the EGFR inhibitor Gefitinib
  abolishes the stimulatory effect of TAM on HER2-overexpressing cells.(36)\n\n\n\nBerry
  polyphenols inhibit the tyrosine kinase activity of EGFR and HER2, leading to reduced
  autophosphorylation, a key step in receptor activation. The inhibition of this step
  leads to reduced phosphorylation of several kinases such as phosphotidylinositol-3-phosphate
  kinase/protein kinase B and extracellular signal regulated kinase/mitogen activated
  protein kinase. Table 4 summarizes the effect of various berry polyphenols on EGFR,
  HER2, and their downstream targets. Polyphenols can interfere with TKR action by
  two possible mechanisms: inhibiting tyrosine kinase activity and preventing the
  dimerization between the various EGFR family members. There is clear evidence that
  many berry polyphenols inhibit the tyrosine kinase activity of EGFR and HER2 purified
  from the cell membrane. This also occurs in intact cells, albeit at considerably
  higher doses.(37, 38) However, evidence of whether these polyphenols inhibit the
  dimerization of GFRs is not known. In a well-designed study, Weinstein and co-workers
  showed that the green tea polyphenol epigallocatechin gallate and extract polyphenon
  E can inhibit the EGF-induced dimerization of EGFR in HT29 cells by disruption of
  lipid order in the plasma membrane.(39) They also found that cyanidin and delphinidin
  do not cause disruption of lipid order, but their effect on EGFR dimerization was
  not tested. The authors report exposure times of 5–30 min. Thus, it is not clear
  whether plasma membrane incorporation of EGCG plays any role in the observed effects.
  In a separate study, it has been shown that elderberry anthocyanins are incorporated
  into the plasma membrane of endothelial cells after 4 h.(40) It would be interesting
  to explore whether berry polyphenols inhibit the dimerization and subsequent activation
  of the TKR either by their ability to incorporate into the cell membrane or by direct
  binding to the receptors.\n\nTable 4. Berry Polyphenol Interaction with Growth Factor

  kinase; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase.\n\nMany studies presented in Table 4 have
  been conducted in cell lines that overexpress EGFR or HER2 with or without ER. However,
  the cross-talk between EGFR activation and ER phosphorylation has rarely been explored
  in these. With respect to TAM cotreatment, it is unknown whether any of the selected
  berry compounds selectively potentiate or inhibit its effects and how this may affect
  the development of TAM resistance. Cotreatment of BT474 or SKBR cells with delphinidin
  significantly reduces the effect of HER2 inhibitors Herceptin and Lapatinib.(41)
  Although the authors report significant inhibition of HER2 signaling in these cells,
  they do not mention whether delphinidin actually binds to the HER2 receptor. Therefore,
  it can only be speculated that the reduced efficacy of the drugs is due to the binding
  of HER2 receptor by delphinidin, but the exact mechanism is unknown.\n\nIt is clear
  that many berry polyphenols can inhibit the tyrosine kinase signaling component
  of the EGFR family of TKRs. Constitutive activation of TKR and the subsequent activation
  of ER through phosphorylation are involved in the development of TAM-resistant recurrent
  tumors.(42) However, very little is known about whether the presence of one or more
  polyphenols can inhibit the development of TAM resistance and whether their effect
  on the EGFR/HER2 pathway plays a significant role in this. More research is warranted
  to understand the mechanisms by which berry polyphenols affect the EGFR/HER2 pathway
  and its cross-talk with ER signaling, both in the presence and in the absence of
  TAM.\n\n\n\nProgrammed cell death in cancer cells can be classified into at least
  three types: apoptosis, autophagy, and necroptosis.(43, 44) They play important
  and defined roles in the normal development during ductal elongation, alveolar development,
  and especially the postlactional involution of the mammary gland.(45, 46) The balance
  between survival and death in breast epithelial cells is determined by induction
  of one or more of these mechanisms by various signaling molecules. The two mechanisms
  pertaining to breast cancer development, apoptosis and autophagy, are discussed
  herein. Whereas apoptosis has been studied extensively, autophagy is a relatively
  new field; its possible correlation is being explored further. In primary breast
  cancer, cancer cells evade apoptosis to survive. Resistance to apoptosis caused
  by increased expression of anti-apoptotic and/or reduced expression of pro-apoptotic
  molecules is often seen in breast cancer. Induction of apoptosis by a drug leads
  to reduction in cell survival and tumor growth.(47, 48) Autophagy is a mechanism
  of both cell survival and cell death, and its role and regulation are of significant
  interest. The beclin 1 gene, a mediator of autophagy, is deleted in 50% of breast
  tumors. In primary breast cancer cells resistant to apoptosis, induction of autophagy
  results in cell death, and heterozygous knockout of the BECN1 gene leads to accelerated
  malignancy.(49) On the other hand, recent studies point to a role for autophagy
  in AE resistance, wherein inhibition of autophagy leads to sensitization of resistant
  cells to AE and subsequent cell death.(50-52) Thus, autophagy may play a dual role,
  and whether the induction of autophagy is pro- or anticancer is dependent on the
  cellular context and the stage of cancer development.(51)\n\nKinases act as connectors
  of upstream signaling to downstream transcription factors and are central to modulating
  the effects of growth factors, hormones, and cytokines on the breast epithelium.
  They are key players in determining the cell’s decision to live or die. The ERK/MAPK
  and PI3K/AKT pathways play an important role in linking the GFR and ER signaling.
  Kinase signaling is significantly altered during breast cancer development, and
  its inhibition can reduce cancer cell growth.(53) Ultimately, the kinases converge
  on key transcription regulators, Jun/Fos for the MAPK and mTOR for the PI3K. The
  function of transcription regulators in a cancer cell is to overcome self-limiting
  growth and evade cell death. Evasion of apoptosis by increased expression of anti-apoptotic/pro-proliferative
  molecules and down-regulation of pro-apoptotic/antiproliferative molecules are commonly
  seen in cancer cells.\n\n\n\nIf the goal of the cancer cell is to avoid cell-death
  mechanisms, then the objective of a chemopreventive agent is to enforce these. Data
  summarized in Table 5 suggest that many berry compounds can induce both apoptosis
  and autophagy. Although all of the studies have not been done in breast cancer cells,
  the aim of this section is to highlight the mechanisms by which berry compounds
  cause cell death. Because autophagic cell death has not been extensively studied
  for the selected berry polyphenols in breast cancer cells, evidence from other cell
  lines is presented. Several mechanisms have been proposed regarding the apoptotic
  effect of these compounds, whereas ROS generation has been suggested for compounds
  including delphinidin, kaempferol, and resveratrol; caspase- and p53-dependent apoptosis
  can be induced by other compounds. Regardless of the mechanisms by which these compounds
  induce cell death, kinase signaling is involved in most cases, except for cyanidin
  and quercetin. Although a likely mechanism is the inhibition of TKRs and the subsequent
  phosphorylation of downstream kinases, it appears that in some cases the opposite
  is true. For example, delphinidin-induced apoptosis in HepG2 cells involves increased
  p-JNK,(54) and resveratrol and kaempferol induce apoptosis in breast cancer cells
  by sustained ERK1/2 activation.(55, 56) Berry compounds also induce autophagy by
  different mechanisms. AE-resistant cells may utilize autophagy as a mechanism of
  cell survival.(51, 57) Feng et al. showed that although delphindin has no effect
  on HCC cells at 24 h, sustained induction of autophagy ultimately results in reduced
  cell survival at 120 h.(58) Pterostilbene, a blueberry stilbene, induces both apoptosis
  and autophagy in drug-resistant bladder cancer cells.(59) Because the utilization
  of autophagy for cell survival is highly dependent on cellular context, it is imperative
  to explore the effects of berry compounds on autophagy and how the interplay affects
  the development of drug resistance in breast cancer cells.\n\nTable 5. Control of

  breast cancer usually consist of cancer cell lines that are derived from tumors
  of varied origins and kept in culture continuously. Although these models are helpful
  in describing the molecular mechanisms of breast cancer and in the discovery of
  drugs used to effectively target particular pathways, they fall short when it comes
  to studying cancer prevention. The reason is that cancer cell lines are already
  transformed and thus do not represent a typical population for “primary prevention”.
  Immortalized normal cells can be cultured with physiological concentrations of polyphenols
  for several passages and then tested for transformation upon challenge with a carcinogen.
  Although this would simulate primary prevention, it must be kept in mind that even
  these “normal” cells have altered their molecular behavior to adapt to the culture
  conditions and hence are poor substitutes for mimicking the real nature of the developing
  breast epithelium. In vitro studies also do not take into account interaction between
  various cell types in the breast. Various 3-D cultures have been used to mimic the
  stromal–epithelial interactions.(60, 61) However, we are not aware of any study
  that has used a 3-D culture to study berry polyphenols.\n\nAnother limitation of
  many in vitro studies reported is their use of concentrations of pure compounds
  in the micromolar range. Yet, it is clear that the actual plasma concentrations
  of many of these agents are in the nanomolar range. Thus, the doses used in these
  studies largely limit their usefulness in the translational setting. The primary
  paradigm of research with bioactive compounds has been to find agents that “kill”
  cancer cells, regardless of the concentration at which this occurs. It is easy to
  understand that killing a cancer cell is not the same as preventing cancer development.
  Nonetheless, this flawed concept has often supported the use of high in vitro concentrations.
  Furthermore, due to their relatively nontoxic nature, the maximum tolerated dose
  for many food bioactives is high in rodents.(62) This has in turn supported the
  use of high doses of a purified compound, rather than a natural food source, in
  animal models. The culmination of this paradigm is evident in the clinical outcome
  of the ATBC trial, wherein supraphysiological doses of vitamins A and E caused an
  increase in lung cancer incidence in an at-risk population.(63) This has led to
  a critical rethinking of our approach to food and food component research.(64-66)
  Thus, currently there is a heightened awareness among scientists to use more physiologically
  relevant concentrations and an appreciation for the synergy among food components
  as well as the effects of a food matrix.\n\nBerry extracts form an intermediate
  system between testing individual berry compounds in vitro and whole berries in
  vivo. Typically, alcohol extracts enriched in berry polyphenolics have been tested
  on various cancer cell lines to assess their effects in reducing cell proliferation.
  The IC50 values for these extracts for various cell lines range from 27 μg/mL to
  4 mg/mL.(67, 68) Studies show that extracts reduce cell proliferation using similar
  mechanisms of action as pure compounds but at a much lower concentration.(69-71)
  Extracts also may account for the synergistic action of different compounds as present
  in the food matrix. Seeram et al. showed that extracts and fruit juices achieve
  significantly higher antiproliferative effects on various cancer cells than when
  their individual components are used.(72, 73)\n\n\n\nThe complexity of studying
  berry phytochemicals is further increased by the presence of many metabolites. The
  metabolism of polyphenols plays an important role in their bioavailability. Also
  the gut and liver metabolites affect the effectiveness of these compounds in vivo.
  Gut metabolites of ellagic acid, urolithins A and B, interact with the ER signaling
  in very different ways. The anthocyanidins are conjugated with many types of sugar
  moieties to form anthocyanins. This can influence both the gut metabolism and the
  absorption of these compounds.(74) Furthermore, the type and quantity of metabolites
  generated varies widely depending on the gut microbiota and the gene polymorphisms
  of the consumer. Only a few of these metabolites have been discovered. Thus, an
  in vitro study reporting the effects of a pure berry compound will provide only
  a partial picture of its full potential. The best way to take into account the contribution
  of metabolites is to use in vivo approaches.\n\n\nAnimal models are necessary tools
  for understanding the effects of both pure compounds and whole berries, given through
  the diet, on mammary tumorigenesis. Models currently being used consist of 7,12-dimethylbenze(a)anthrazene-induced
  tumors in Sprague–Dawley rats, E2-induced tumors in August–Copenhagen–Irish hooded
  rats, and transgenic mice containing specific gene alterations and xenograft of
  human breast cancer cells in immunodeficient mice.(75-78) Although they provide
  a better system for evaluating the preventive aspects of dietary components, certain
  key points have to be kept in mind regarding the use of these in vivo models in
  chemoprevention studies. First, in rat models of mammary tumorigenesis, it is important
  to deliver the initiating insult to the terminal end buds, which are the most susceptible
  structures, at a specific moment of glandular development. In the DMBA model, this
  is a very narrow period, beyond which tumor incidence is greatly altered. In ACI
  rats, this window is slightly larger; however, dramatic differences in tumor volume
  can still be seen when E2 implantation is done at 7 versus 9 weeks. Dietary phytochemicals
  fed prior to this window can alter mammary gland development and thus potentially
  change this window. Second, breast cancer xenografts cannot be used for prevention
  studies because they assess the growth retardation of already tumorigenic cells,
  and studies in transgenic mice usually focus on a single gene or molecular pathway.
  Third, the bioavailability of various berry polyphenols changes depending on the
  species used.(79, 80) These factors may influence the data derived from rodent studies,
  and investigators must be aware of these when they are interpreting chemoprevention
  data.\n\n\nIndividual berry compounds and whole berries have been used in animal
  models to illustrate their effect in preventing or reducing tumor growth. Pterostilbene
  reduces the formation of DMBA-induced mammary transformation in an ex vivo organ
  culture.(81) Lariciresinol is a precursor of secoisolarisiresinol, a lignan found
  in some berries.(82) Saarinen et al. treated rats with 3 or 15 mg/kg of LR 10 weeks
  after mammary tumors were induced with DMBA. Whereas there was no reduction in incidence
  or multiplicity of these already established tumors, LR significantly reduced tumor
  growth and surface area after 9 weeks of administration.(83) Dietary LR also reduces
  the growth of orthotopic MCF-7 tumors in nude mice.(84, 85) Quercetin shows a dose-dependent
  reduction of 30–50% of DMBA-induced mammary tumors, at dietary doses of 2 and 5%,
  respectively.(86) However, another study in the same model with a similar treatment
  protocol showed no effect of a 2% diet.(87) In a recent study, Singh et al. showed
  that 2.5% quercetin in the diet can increase E2-induced mammary tumors by inhibition
  of the phase II P450 enzyme catechol-O-methyl transferase that detoxifies harmful
  E2 metabolites.(88) These authors clearly show that both phase I and II metabolism
  of E2 play an important role in the development of E2-induced mammary tumors in
  ACI rats.(89) However, the dose of 2.5%, translating to 25 g/kg diet, is relatively
  high. Considering the fact that the highest amount of quercetin to be found in any
  berry species is only 158 mg/kg in bog whortleberry,(90) such doses are unachievable
  using natural berry sources. This also underscores the importance of using biologically
  relevant doses in animal models. Although individual compounds are effective at
  various levels in reduction of mammary tumor indices, the question of the food matrix
  effect remains. Whole berries supplemented at 2.5% dose inhibit E2-induced mammary
  tumorigenesis in ACI rats.(91-93) The interest in berries as a chemopreventive agent
  stemmed from the pioneering work of Stoner and colleagues in using berries for the
  prevention of esophageal cancer.(94-96) When the ACI rat studies were initiated,
  whole berries had not been tested in any cancer other than gastrointestinal tract
  cancers. Nevertheless, sound scientific and translational reasoning lay behind the
  choice of the type of berries, their respective doses, and the preclinical animal
  model used.\n\nIn initial studies, ellagic acid showed a dose-dependent decrease
  in 4-hydroxyestradiol-mediated DNA damage in vitro as well as a significant up-regulation
  of DNA damage repair genes in vivo.(97) Black raspberries had been tested successfully
  against carcinogen-induced esophageal tumors(98) and are an excellent source of
  ellagic acid and anthocyanins primarily in the form of cyanidin glycoside conjugates.(76)
  On the other hand, blueberry contains moderate levels of anthocyanins derived from
  five different anthocyanidins, delphinidin, malvidin, petunidin, peonidin, and cyanidin,
  but almost no ellagic acid. They are also cultivated at a much larger scale than
  black raspberries and are more easily available to the consumers.(99) To further
  delineate the chemopreventive effects of anthocyanins versus ellagic acid, a group
  of rats were fed ellagic acid alone. The equivalent concentration of ellagic acid
  in 2.5% black raspberry diet is 80 ppm; thus, the ellagic acid only diet also compares
  the effectiveness of delivering a whole food matrix versus individual components.
  A dose of 2.5% for the berries was selected to enable translation to reasonably
  achievable human doses and is the lowest dose of berries to be tested in an animal
  model to date. With regard to the animal model, ACI rats implanted subcutaneously
  with silastic implants containing E2 develop mammary adenocarcinoma in 6–8 months.(93,
  100, 101) The plasma levels of E2 and progesterone in these animals are between
  35 and 230 pg/mL and 35 pg/mL, compared to 15–53 and 35 pg/mL, respectively, in
  untreated rats.(93, 100, 102) In premenopausal women, the E2 levels range between
  20 and 1500 pg/mL depending on the ovulatory phase, whereas the progesterone levels
  are 1–9 ng/mL during ovulation with a very wide interindividual variation.(103)
  Because higher circulating levels of these steroid hormones are linked to increased
  breast cancer risk,(104, 105) this preclinical model is to some extent clinically
  relevant. Furthermore, the combination of low-dose dietary berries and high-dose
  E2 provides a higher translational quotient.\n\nDietary black raspberry, blueberry,
  and ellagic acid significantly reduce E2-induced mammary tumor indices such as tumor
  latency, incidence, volume, multiplicity, and mortality to various extents in the
  ACI rat model. The data from three individual tumorigenesis studies summarized in
  Table 6 show that these berries are consistently effective in the prevention of
  mammary tumors in this animal model. Black raspberry is the most effective in reducing
  tumor indices, followed by ellagic acid and then blueberry diet. However, in studies
  1 and 2, in which mortality due to pituitary hyperplasia was higher, blueberry significantly
  reduced this mortality.(93) Berry diets decrease E2-induced mammary cell proliferation
  in these rats,(106) which may be due to either the promotion of cell death or an
  antiestrogenic effect. There is evidence for the latter because both dietary berries
  and ellagic acid counteract the E2-induced increase in the uterine weight.(76) Of
  interest pertaining to the previous discussion of quercetin, Aiyer and Gupta showed
  that dietary berries and ellagic acid decrease the expression of COMT in the mammary
  epithelium at 18 weeks after E2 treatment but not at 6 weeks. This temporal effect
  is linked to the expression of CYP1A1, an enzyme whose product is the substrate
  for COMT. CYP1A1 expression is significantly down-regulated by berries at 6 weeks.(91)
  Even though COMT expression is reduced, there is no increase in tumor indices as
  reported by the previous authors.(88, 91) This further highlights the importance
  of the food matrix as well as the use of a physiologically relevant dose. Berries
  also reverse E2-induced hepatic oxidative DNA damage.(107) However, the effect of
  dietary berries on hepatic enzymes involved in E2 metabolism has not been explored
  yet.\n\nTable 6. Summary of Three in Vivo Studies Performed with Berry Intervention
  in ACI Rats  \n\n\n\nV, tumor volume; M, tumor multiplicity; B, burden = tumor volume/multiplicity.\n\n\nStudy
  1 was a pilot study; some data for ellagic acid group are missing, and hence the
  true effect of intervention cannot be clearly assessed. Also, the first column is
  2.5% mixed-berry diet instead of 2.5% black raspberry diet.\n\n\n\nMore recently,
  Wu et al. have shown that maternal exposure to 5% blueberry diets significantly
  affects both mammary branching and the size of terminal end buds in pups. This is
  indicative of a reduced mammary tumor susceptibility(108, 109) However, these investigators
  have not yet reported mammary tumor incidences in these pups. In another study,
  blueberry juice significantly inhibit the growth of MDA-MB-231 tumors in nude mice
  mediated by the inhibition of the PI3K/AKT pathway.(70) In a follow-up study, 5
  and 10% blueberry diets reduce the volume of orthotopic MDA-MB-231 tumors by 75
  and 60%, respectively, suggesting that a lower dose is more effective. Inhibition
  of Wnt signaling is involved in the tumor retardation.(110)\n\nThese data collectively
  show that whole berries and berry constituents have significant preventive effect
  on the development of mammary tumors in preclinical animal models. Allometric conversion
  to human equivalents from the rodent studies suggests that a daily intake of as
  little as 1–2 cups of fresh berries may provide significant benefits.(76, 110) These
  preclinical studies offer strong evidence to pursue a pilot clinical trial among
  women at high risk of developing breast cancer. Although long-term follow-ups through
  the course of a lifetime are not feasible, changes in biomarkers after short- to
  medium-term exposures can be assessed. The period between initial diagnostic core
  biopsy and the surgical removal of tumor has been suggested as a potential window
  to evaluate the effects of chemopreventive agents on breast tissue biomarkers.(111)
  This window can be effectively used to assess the effect of different types of berries
  on biomarkers of breast cancer risk.\n\n\n\nTo put the information gathered from
  the interactions of berry phenolics with cell-signaling pathways in the context
  of breast cancer prevention, we will consider the three “windows” of prevention
  available during a woman’s lifetime.(84) The primary prevention window occurs during
  in utero to peripubertal periods. Epigenetic modification in the mammary gland during
  this developmental period has an effect on breast cancer risk.(112-115) Furthermore,
  exposure to dietary phytoestrogens during this developmental period affects breast
  cancer risk.(116) The only support for effectiveness of berries in this prevention
  phase comes from a study showing that in utero blueberry diet reduces the number
  of terminal end buds, the glandular structures most susceptible to transformation
  by a carcinogen.(109) Epigenetic regulation is a possible mechanism by which this
  is accomplished. At present, only ellagic acid has been shown to inhibit DNA methyltransferase,
  an enzyme involved in the methylation of DNA and hence causing epigenetic modifications
  in MCF7 cells.(117) Data on the effect of other berry polyphenols in the epigenetic
  regulation of mammary gland development is yet to be explored. Although this may
  be a good approach to chemoprevention, it may not be directly applicable to the
  larger at-risk population that currently exists. More studies on the effects of
  dietary berry exposure at other stages of mammary gland development are needed to
  assess which may be the best stage for preventive intervention.\n\nThe secondary
  prevention window occurs from adulthood to the first diagnosis of breast cancer.
  Much of the data discussed in this review pertain to this window. Although there
  is no direct evidence that berry consumption throughout adulthood will prevent breast
  cancer incidence, the mechanistic action of berry compounds provides support for
  this. The data from in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that berry polyphenols
  act in an antiestrogenic fashion in the presence of E2.(76) Berry polyphenols inhibit
  GFR activation, which is also involved in the growth of primary tumors. These compounds
  also beneficially modify many other pathways involved in breast cancer development.
  Preclinical studies presented in the previous section provide evidence to support
  this. Thus, consuming berries during adulthood could be protective for high-risk
  women. Clinical trials can be conducted in high-risk women, and the changes in circulating
  E2 levels, antioxidant status, plasma and urinary polyphenols/metabolites, and other
  relevant biomarkers can be assessed as an indication of risk and benefit.\n\nThere
  are many fewer preclinical data available on whether berries will be effective during
  the tertiary prevention phase, the period after breast cancer diagnosis, when a
  woman is on adjuvant or neoadjuvant endocrine therapy. This is the chemoprevention
  of recurrent breast cancer. So far, an animal model that mimics endocrine resistance
  development is not yet available to researchers. However, on the basis of the signaling
  effects and what is known about AE resistance development, one can speculate the
  effects of berry and its compounds in tertiary prevention of breast cancer. If these
  agents potentiate drug activity, perhaps a lower dose can be used, leading to reduced
  drug side effects and/or resistance. Finally, the cross-talk between GFR and ER
  signaling plays an important role in the development of AE resistance. Inhibition
  of GFR/kinase signaling by berry polyphenols may reduce the development of resistance
  arising due to this crosstalk. The effect of polyphenols on the metabolism and clearance
  of tamoxifen is also an area that requires further research. However, these are
  only the speculated benefits of the berries. The effectiveness of berries in the
  tertiary prevention phase still needs to be explored. There is a paucity of data
  even at the in vitro level, because few studies have focused on how berry polyphenols
  may affect AE activity. This research is even more imperative because, in the Internet
  era, much information is available to the public regarding the possible “beneficial”
  effects of these compounds that may or may not be substantiated by original research.(118)
  The onus is on the scientific community to provide persuasive evidence for the protective
  effect of berries and berry polyphenols in the prevention of recurrent breast cancer,
  especially when provided alongside routine endocrine therapies.\n\nBerry bioactives
  have a high potential for breast cancer chemoprevention as they act on multiple
  pathways involved in carcinogenesis. Studies from preclinical animal models strongly
  support the preventive role of berries in primary breast cancer. Interaction with
  the ER and TKR signaling may play a role in this beneficial effect. However, their
  effect on other pathways such as inflammatory and angiogenic signaling cannot be
  dismissed. Berries may also reduce tumor growth by promoting cell death. Their role
  in inducing apoptotic cell death is well studied. However, autophagic cell death
  is emerging as an important mechanism by which a population of cells can survive
  drug treatment and thus lead to drug resistance. The study of how various berry
  polyphenols affect autophagy during the development of AE resistance can illuminate
  their usefulness for the prevention of drug resistance.\n\nFinally, there are very
  limited data in the literature for the anthocyanins and anthocyanidins. Considering
  that anthocyanins are the most ubiquitous polyphenols present in berries and likely
  play an important role in the in vivo effects of whole berries, more research is
  required on how anthocyanins interact with and alter the various molecular pathways
  of breast cancer development.\n\nWith heightened media awareness regarding a healthy
  lifestyle, berries are fast becoming the go-to superfruits for their health benefits.
  On the basis of the evidence presented, the case for using berries as preventive
  intervention in primary breast cancer is strong; whether this is true in recurrent
  cancer remains to be determined. There is much that needs to be explored before
  firm recommendations can be set forth for breast cancer survivors.\n\n\nH.S.A. is
