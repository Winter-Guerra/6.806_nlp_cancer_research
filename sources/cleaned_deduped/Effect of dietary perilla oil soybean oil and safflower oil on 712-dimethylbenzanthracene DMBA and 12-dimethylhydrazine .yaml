  The effects of diet supplemented with perilla oil, which contains a large amount
  of n-3 alpha-linolenic acid, and n-6 linoleic acid rich soybean and safflower oil
  supplemented diets on 7,12-dimethylbenzanthracene - and 1,2-dimethylhydrazine -induced
  mammary gland and colon carcinogenesis were investigated in female SD rats. Groups
  of 23 or 24, 5 week old animals were first given three s.c. injections of 40 mg/kg
  body wt DMH followed by a single intragastric administration of 50 mg/kg body wt
  DMBA within 2 weeks of the commencement. Starting 1 week after the DMBA treatment,
  they were administered pellet diet containing 10% perilla oil, soybean oil or safflower
  oil for the succeeding 33 weeks. Histological examination revealed that the resultant
  numbers of mammary tumors per rat were significantly lower in rats given perilla
  oil diet  than in the soybean oil diet group. Furthermore, colon tumor incidence
  was significantly lower in animals receiving the perilla oil supplement  than in
  those given safflower oil diet, and the numbers of colon tumors per rat tended to
  be lowest in rats administered perilla oil. Also the incidence of nephroblastomas
  in rats receiving perilla oil diet  was significantly lower than that for the soybean
  oil diet group. The results thus indicate that the alpha-linolenic acid -rich perilla
  oil diet inhibits development of mammary gland, colon and kidney tumors as compared
  to linoleic acid -rich safflower or soybean oil diet.'
