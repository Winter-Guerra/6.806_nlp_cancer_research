text: "\n\n\n\n\n\nSoy and red clover isoflavones are controversial due to purported
  estrogenic activity and possible effects on breast cancer. We conducted a systematic
  review of soy and red clover for efficacy in improving menopausal symptoms in women
  with breast cancer, and for potential impact on risk of breast cancer incidence
  or recurrence.\n\n\n\nWe searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and AMED
  from inception to March 2013 for human interventional or observational data pertaining
  to the safety and efficacy of soy and red clover isoflavones in patients with or
  at risk of breast cancer. \n\n\n\nOf 4179 records, we included a total of 131 articles:
  40 RCTs, 11 uncontrolled trials, and 80 observational studies. Five RCTs reported
  on the efficacy of soy for hot flashes, showing no significant reductions in hot
  flashes compared to placebo. There is lack of evidence showing harm from use of
  soy with respect to risk of breast cancer or recurrence, based on long term observational
  data. Soy intake consistent with that of a traditional Japanese diet may be protective
  against breast cancer and recurrence. Human trials show that soy does not increase
  circulating estradiol or affect estrogen-responsive target tissues. Prospective
  data of soy use in women taking tamoxifen does not indicate increased risk of recurrence.
  Evidence on red clover is limited, however existing studies suggest that it may
  not possess breast cancer-promoting effects. \n\n\n\nSoy consumption may be associated
  with reduced risk of breast cancer incidence, recurrence, and mortality. Soy does
  not have estrogenic effects in humans. Soy intake consistent with a traditional
  Japanese diet appears safe for breast cancer survivors. While there is no clear
  evidence of harm, better evidence confirming safety is required before use of high
  dose isoflavones can be recommended for breast cancer patients. \n\nCitation: Fritz

  cancer accounts for almost one third of cancers diagnosed among women. In the United
  States, there were approximately 288 thousand new cases expected for 2011 . Breast
  cancer is also the second leading cause of cancer death among women, with nearly
  40 thousand attributable deaths expected in 2011 in the US . Dietary interventions
  are emerging as increasingly important strategies for reducing risk of developing
  breast cancer or recurrence . Among breast cancer survivors, for instance, the Women’s
  Healthy Eating and Living study found that interventions with a diet high in fruits
  and vegetables, dietary fibre, and low in saturated fat reduced recurrence by 31%
  among women without hot flashes compared to the control group , and that higher
  vegetable intake, particularly cruciferous vegetables, may have enhanced the effect
  of tamoxifen, with a 44% reduction in recurrence . If shown effective, these and
  other dietary strategies represent an important way for women to reduce their cancer
  risk, or for breast cancer patients to reduce recurrence and safely augment the
  effects of cancer treatment. Soy has emerged as a specific food that may reduce
  breast cancer risk , and is among the most commonly used complementary medicines
  utilized by breast cancer patients seeking to reduce risk of recurrence . There
  remains considerable controversy, however, as to its safety, particularly in breast
  cancer survivors due to purported estrogenic effects . \n\nSoy, also known as Glycine
  max, contains the class of phytoestrogens known as isoflavones, specifically, genistein,
  daidzein, glycitein, biochanin A, and formononetin . Isoflavones resemble 17-beta-estradiol
  in structure, and as such are able to bind the estrogen receptor in vitro , behaving
  much as a natural selective estrogen receptor modulator . For instance, the soy
  isoflavones have been found to exert partial ER agonist and antagonist activity
  depending on local estrogen concentrations, with antagonist properties in concentrations
  similar to premenopausal levels, and agonist properties with postmenopausal levels
  . Much of the present debate around soy stems from conflicting in vitro and animal
  evidence. Some studies show that soy isoflavones can increase tumor cell proliferation
  , while other studies show the opposite . The effects of isoflavones in human systems
  promise to be equally complex . Furthermore, in about 30% of the population, daidzein
  can be further metabolized in the gut to equol, a metabolite with higher affinity
  for ER-ß . Finally, in addition to ER mediated activity, soy exerts ER-independent
  effects, including inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor, and proapoptotic
  effects; genistein in particular inhibits tyrosine kinase and induces the tumor
  suppressor protein, PTEN . \n\nLike soy, red clover contains the isoflavones genistein,
  daidzein, biochanin A, and formononetin, however, soy contains higher amounts of
  genistein and daidzein, while the dominant isoflavones in red clover are biochanin
  A and formononetin . In vivo, formononetin is metabolized to daidzein , which may
  be metabolized to equol among equol producers . There are several commercial extracts
  of red clover, marketed for the treatment of menopausal symptoms including hot flashes,
  as well as for menopause related health concerns such as bone loss and dyslipidemia;
  Trinovin® is marketed for men’s health, specifically for benign prostatic hypertrophy.
  Promensil® contains 26mg biochanin A, 16mg formononetin, 1mg genistein, and 0.5mg
  daidzein per tablet . Other commercial products such as Rimostil® and Trinovin®
  contain slightly varying amounts, but are still largely comprised of biochanin A
  and formononetin . Red clover also contains coumestrol, a coumestan that has been
  less well characterized, however, it is present in very low amounts such that its
  net contribution to red clover’s purported estrogenic effect is questionable . \n\nTo
  better elucidate the effect of soy, red clover, or isoflavones from these plants
  on breast cancer, we conducted a systematic review of soy and red clover as used
  by breast cancer patients or those at risk of breast cancer, assessing their impact
  on the risk of primary breast cancer or risk of recurrence. We also assessed the
  impact of isoflavones on surrogate endpoints for predicting breast cancer risk,
  including circulating estradiol and effects on estrogen responsive tissues such
  as the breast, endometrial, and vaginal tissues. Finally, we assessed the efficacy
  of isoflavones in treating menopausal symptoms in patients who have undergone breast
  cancer treatment. \n\n\n\n\n\nElectronic search strategies were developed and tested
  through an iterative process by an experienced medical information specialist in
  consultation with the review team. Using the OVID platform, we searched Ovid MEDLINE®,
  Ovid MEDLINE®In-Process &amp; Other Non-Indexed Citations, EmbaseClassic+Embase,
  and AMED. We also searched the Cochrane Library on Wiley. The strategy was peer
  reviewed prior to execution by an experienced information specialist using the PRESS
  Checklist . No amendments were suggested. \n\nStrategies utilized a combination
  of controlled vocabulary and keywords. Vocabulary and syntax were adjusted across
  databases. Searches pertaining to soy and soy isoflavones were performed in May
  2011 and updated in March 2013; there were no language or date restrictions on any
  of the searches. Searches pertaining to red clover and red clover isoflavones were
  performed in October 2011 and updated in December 2012. Additional references were
  also sought through hand-searching the bibliographies of relevant items. Specific
  details regarding the searches appear in Table S1.\n\n\n\nFor inclusion, evidence
  had to come from clinical trials or observational studies in humans. Human trials
  had to: a) assess the safety and/ or efficacy of soy or red clover or isoflavones
  from these plants in breast cancer patients for the purposes of treatment or secondary
  prevention, or the reduction of side effects associated with chemo- or radiation-
  therapy; alternately, human trials had to: b) assess the effect of soy or red clover
  or isoflavones from these plants on risk of primary breast cancer among women without
  a history of previous breast cancer. Clinical surrogate studies were included if
  they examined endpoints directly related to breast cancer risk, pathogenesis, or
  objective markers assessing healthy bodily function such as hematological function
  in breast cancer patients. All types of breast cancers were included. \n\nObservational
  studies had to report on risk of primary breast cancer or breast cancer recurrence
  associated with soy or red clover consumption compared with non-consumption, in
  a prospective or retrospective design. In vitro and in vivo studies were excluded
  due to the high risk for confounding and previous work on natural health products
  showing a lack of correlation between preclinical and clinical results . Due to
  the nature of soy as a commonly consumed food and red clover as a non-dietary item,
  there were limited observational studies of red clover consumption expected or identified.
  Therefore these studies focus solely on soy. \n\n\n\nFirst pass record screening
  was based on title review with second pass conducted on abstracts and/or full texts
  where uncertainty existed. Reports published in English only were included for full
  analysis if they met inclusion criteria. \n\n\n\nWe piloted data extraction forms
  and conducted extraction independently in duplicate to assess inter-researcher reliability.
  No major inconsistencies in data extraction were found. Both quality and efficacy
  data were extracted. Extraction sheets were prepared based on the Consolidated Standards
  of Reporting Trials statement for clinical trials and the Newcastle-Ottawa scale
  for observational studies . RCTs were assessed for bias using the Cochrane Risk
  of Bias tool.\n\n\n\nData was collected on breast cancer incidence, recurrence,
  or death; impact on hot flashes in breast cancer patients; adverse events; and impact
  on blood or urinary hormone levels: estrone, estradiol, estriol, progesterone, leutinizing
  hormone, follicle stimulating hormone, and sex hormone binding globulin. Data was
  also collected on the impact of soy on hormonally active tissues, including breast
  tissue, endometrial tissue, vaginal tissue, and cervical tissue, as well as on menstrual
  cycle length in premenopausal women.\n\n\n\nWe were unable to pool study findings
  due to heterogeneity between studies, however we display individual study results
  graphically via forest plots. Although we did not quantitatively calculate heterogeneity,
  an informal assessment indicated qualitative incoherence between studies on important
  parameters, most importantly the type and dose of intervention or exposure, as well
  as study populations and endpoints used. \n\n\n\nA total of 4179 records were screened,
  and 131 records were included: from the soy literature search, 2867 records were
  screened, of which 127 were included for full analysis and review. From the red
  clover search, 1312 records were screened, of which four were included for full
  review. Figure 1 shows a flowchart of the literature search and study selection.
  We consider the evidence pertaining to soy and red clover independently below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA
  total of 44 case control studies pertaining to soy were included. These are described
  in Table S2 . Of the 44 studies, 30 reported risk ratios and confident intervals
  relating to the risk of breast cancer; these are displayed in Figures 2-3 . Fourteen
  studies did not report associations as odds ratios with confidence for overall risk
  of breast cancer, and so were not included in the figures .\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.
  \ Risk of Breast Cancer Associated with Intake of Soy Food or Soy Protein.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverall,
  of the 44 case control studies, 32 showed that higher consumption of soy foods and/
  or soy isoflavones was associated with lower risk for primary breast cancer , breast
  cancer mortality , or improved markers of prognosis  among the overall study population.
  None of the case control studies examined effects on recurrence or association with
  use of tamoxifen. None of the studies showed evidence of harm from higher consumption
  of soy, ie. increased risk of breast cancer or mortality. \n\nAmong studies reporting
  ORs with confidence intervals, 19 studies described breast cancer risk associated
  with soy food or soy protein intake ,and 16 examined intake of soy isoflavones .
  Of the 19 studies, 11 showed significant inverse relationships between soy food
  or protein intake and risk of breast cancer . Of the 16 studies, nine showed a significant
  inverse relationship between soy isoflavone intake and risk of breast cancer . There
  were no studies showing significantly increased risk of breast cancer associated
  with soy intake.\n\nOn subgroup analysis, there was no clear difference in effect
  based on the type of soy exposure, or according to study quality, the measure of
  exposure, or menopausal status. There was an indication that higher soy intake,
  defined as greater than 1 serving of soy food or 6.25g soy protein or 12.5mg isoflavones
  daily, was associated with a greater protective effect compared to studies examining
  lower intakes. Eight of 12 studies examining high soy food or protein  and six of
  seven studies examining high soy isoflavones  reported inverse associations between
  soy and breast cancer risk. On the other hand, two of nine and zero of three studies
  respectively found inverse associations with low-medium intake . \n\nSeven studies
  examined the effect of soy by receptor status; these findings were mixed. Three
  studies reported no modification of effect by ER/ PR status . These studies found
  significant protective effects associated with the use of soy overall, but there
  was no modification of this effect by receptor status. Anderson et al found that
  soy isoflavone intake in adulthood was not associated with risk of breast cancer
  for any receptor type, but did find that higher intake during adolescence was associated
  with lower odds of the mixed receptor type: AOR 0.77, 95%CI 0.60-0.99 . Zhang et
  al found that soy was protective among ER+, ER-, PR+, and PR- tumor types, but the
  effect was strongest against both ER+/PR+ and ER-/PR- tumors, as opposed to mixed
  types, ER-/PR+ and ER+/ PR- . Suzuki et al found that soy was significantly protective
  for ER+, PR+, and Her2- tumors, but not ER-, PR-, or Her2+ tumors . Finally Touillard
  found that soy was protective for ER+ but not ER- tumors . Five of six studies examining
  the effects of soyfood consumption in childhood found that higher soy intake, ranging
  from ≥1 to ≥4 servings per week, compared to lower intake, was significantly protective
  against breast cancer in adulthood . In addition, there was some evidence that soy
  may be more protective among women with higher waist-to-hip ratio and/ or body mass
  index, or higher serum estradiol . \n\n\n\nA total of 10 nested case control studies
  were included pertaining to soy, shown in Figures 2-3. The nested case control studies
  were embedded within larger cohorts, which are also reported in their entirety as
  prospective cohort studies below. These were the Shanghai Breast Self-Exam study,
  various arms of the EPIC study, and the Multiethnic cohort in Hawaii . As with case
  control studies, these studies primarily assessed the risk of developing breast
  cancer associated with soy intake, with mixed results. \n\nOf eight studies assessing
  risk of breast cancer, one showed significantly reduced risk associated with higher
  plasma genistein . Grace et al reported a small but significant increase in risk
  of breast cancer associated with higher serum daidzein and serum and urinary equol
  levels; this was expressed as a log2 odds ratio and as a different measure was not
  included in the forest plots . Nonetheless, these findings indicated a 30-45% increased
  odds of breast cancer with a doubling of daidzein and equol levels. In this study,
  39% of the population were equol producers. No significant associations were found
  for other isoflavones including genistein, glycitein, or O-MDA.\n\nFive studies
  showed no significant effects in either direction. One study examined mammographic
  density as a surrogate of breast cancer risk, however with mixed findings . While
  cases were shown to have higher breast density at all ages compared with control
  subjects, and this was significantly associated with soy intake during adulthood,
  the validity of equating this association with increased risk of breast cancer was
  undermined by associations between body mass index and breast density. Leaner women
  with BMI ;25 had greater percent density, but lower risk of breast cancer. \n\n\n\nA
  total of 24 prospective cohort studies were included, described in Table 1 and Table
  S3 . Of 11 studies reporting on risk of primary breast cancer, one showed that soy
  isoflavone intake was associated with overall reduced risk of breast cancer , while
  the remaining studies showed no associations . A total of nine unique studies from
  this group reported odds ratios with confidence intervals, and are shown in Figures
  2-3 . There were no studies indicating a higher risk of breast cancer associated
  with soy consumption. As with case control studies, there was no clear difference
  in effect direction when studies were grouped according to study quality.   \n\n\nTable

  the publication, but an estimate was calculated based the time between the end of
  the recruitment period and data censure/ end of follow-up. \n\n\n\nTwo studies reported
  on associations with mammographic density as a predictor of breast cancer risk .
  One study reported an inverse association between soy intake and breast density
  , while the second reported an inverse association between soy intake and breast
  density among equol producers only .\n\nTwo studies reported on menopausal symptoms
  and quality of life among breast cancer patients . There was a positive association
  between soy intake and hot flashes among premenopausal breast cancer patients in
  one study suggesting relative estrogen antagonism , and an indication that soy supplement
  use was associated with better physical quality of life in a second study .\n\n\n\nNine
  prospective studies reported on risk of breast cancer recurrence or mortality .
  These are described in Table 1. Five of nine reported on breast cancer recurrence
  , and seven of nine reported on mortality . \n\nOf five studies reporting on recurrence
  , two showed protective effects . Four studies reported risk for the overall study
  population, of which one found significantly decreased risk of breast cancer recurrence
  or longer disease-free survival associated with higher soy intake . The fifth study
  reported results by pre- and post- menopausal status only; this study found lower
  risk of recurrence among post-menopausal patients, HR 0.67 only . A similar association
  was found for ER+/ PR+ patients and for those on anastrozole . The amount of soy
  associated with protective effects in these studies was &gt;15.31g soy protein or
  &gt;62.68mg soy isoflavones ; and &gt;42.3mg soy isoflavones . Three of the five
  studies found non-significant associations , and there were no studies reporting
  increased risk of recurrence associated with soy intake.\n\nOf seven studies examining
  survival , four showed protective effects on breast cancer mortality or mortality
  in breast cancer patients . Six studies reported overall results for the study population,
  and are shown in Figure 4. These effects were seen at a soy intake of &gt;35.3mg
  soy isoflavones or &gt;15.78g soy protein ; &gt;28.83mg soy isoflavones or &gt;13.03g
  soy protein ; &gt;7.48mg soy isoflavones ; &gt;62.68mg soy isoflavones or 15.31g
  soy protein . Caan et al reported a trend toward decreased risk of death among tamoxifen
  users with intake of total isoflavones ≥6.3mg per day, HR 0.26, and also among women
  with ER+ or PR+ status, HR 0.31, but this was not significant . Two additional studies
  showed no significant effects . \n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.  Risk of Mortality Associated
  with Intake of Soy Protein or Isoflavones.\n\n\n\n\nWe included 11 uncontrolled
  trials examining the effect of soy on safety outcomes relevant to breast cancer
  risk and progression . These are summarized in Figure 5 alongside the RCTs, with
  additional details available in Table S4. These studies showed no evidence of harm
  from consumption of soy. \n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.  Effect of Soy on Hormonal Biomarkers
  and Estrogen Dependent Tissues.\n\n\nIn studies conducted among healthy women, there
  were no significant changes compared to baseline in endometrial thickness ; rates
  of normal mammogram results ; menstrual cycle length ; or urinary excretion of estrogen
  \ or the ratio of urinary estrogen metabolites 2:16 OH-estrone . There were varying
  results with regard to impact on serum estrogen and progesterone levels, with two
  studies showing no significant impact on serum estradiol , while two studies show
  significant decreases in estradiol , and three studies show decreases in progesterone/
  luteal phase progesterone . One study indicated that soy may have differential effects
  in equol producers compared with non-producers: soy consumption increased serum
  estradiol from 33.75 to 137.4 pmol/L among equol producers, but decreased it from
  51.5 to 29.75 in non-producers . With respect to nipple aspirate volume, a marker
  of breast tissue proliferative activity, one study showed no change  while one study
  found a significant increase in NAV among premenopausal women only, from 16 to 36
  µL . \n\n\n\nOf the 38 randomized controlled trials, five assessed the efficacy
  of soy for hot flashes among breast cancer survivors , while 34 assessed safety
  parameters in healthy women ; one study assessed both hot flashes and safety parameters
  and hence is counted twice . The five RCTs assessing hot flashes or menopausal symptom
  scores all found reduced symptoms in both the treatment and the control groups,
  between 15% to 50% compared to baseline , however with no significant difference
  between them. \n\nA total of 18 RCTs assessed circulating estrogens levels Fifteen
  of 18 studies found no significant impact from soy compared to the control group
  . Three studies found a significant reduction in circulating estrogens compared
  to the control group . One of these found that the consumption of 36oz isoflavone-free
  soy milk delivering approximately 38g soy protein every day for one menstrual cycle
  resulted in a 20% decrease in serum estradiol compared to the control group across
  the cycle; this was accompanied by a 30% decrease in luteal phase progesterone,
  but no change in LH or FSH . One study found that consumption of soy protein resulted
  in decreases in estrone, testosterone, androstenedione, DHEA, DHEA-s, and cortisol;
  and increases in progesterone, progesterone: estradiol ratio, FSH and SHBG among
  equol producers only, compared to non-producers . Another study by the same group
  found no significant effect on serum estradiol, FSH, or LH, but a significant decrease
  in estrone and increase in SHBG compared to control subjects . There were no RCTs
  showing a significant increase in circulating estrogens. \n\nA total of nine RCTs
  assessed the impact of soy consumption on estrogen metabolism as measured through
  urinary excretion of urinary metabolites. Of these, five reports of six studies
  found no significant change in 2-hydroxyestrone, 16α-hydroxyestrone, or 2:16α hydroxyestrone
  ratio compared to the control group . The remaining three studies found significant
  increases in 2-hydroxyestrone or 2:16α hydroxyestrone ratio , which has been thought
  to represent an anticancer shift in estrogen metabolism. Nettleton found that consumption
  of soy protein at a dose of 0.64mg isoflavones/kg daily had no impact on urinary
  estrogen metabolites in the group as a whole; however there was a significant increase
  in 2-hydroxyestrone and 2:16α hydroxyestrone ratio among subjects who were equol
  producers . Xu reported a significant decrease in 4-hydroxyestrone and an increase
  in 2:16α hydroxyestrone ratio among subjects consuming soy protein isolate compared
  to those consuming a low-isoflavone protein isolate . Lu reported similar results
  from consumption of 36oz soymilk delivering 158mg isoflavones daily, with significant
  increases in 2-hydroxyestrone and 2:16α hydroxyestrone ratio compared to subjects
  consuming an isoflavone-free soymilk .\n\nNone of the studies assessing endometrial
  thickness , mammographic density or mammographic changes , nipple aspirate volume
  , PAP results and uterine fibroid growth , or vaginal cytology  found any evidence
  of negative impact from soy compared to the control group. Kataoka et al. reported
  no impact of soy on mammographic density when utilizing two of the three assessment
  methods; one method found a significant decrease in breast density among the soy
  group compared to the controls, but this became non significant after adjusting
  for baseline density . Two of five studies assessing menstrual cycle length reported
  significant increases of between 1.8 to 3.5 days in cycle length associated with
  soy consumption compared to control subjects ; the remaining studies found no effects
  . \n\nThree studies looked at molecular markers of breast cell proliferation or
  genetic markers of breast cancer risk. One study found no change in BRCA 1 and 2
  mRNA level due to soy consumption, however there was a decrease over time in the
  placebo group, yielding a significant difference between groups . One study of women
  with either benign or malignant breast disease, found that consumption of 60g soy
  protein delivering 45mg isoflavones daily increased in vivo markers of breast epithelial
  proliferation: thymidine labeling index showing the number of cells in S-phase and
  progesterone receptor expression, both increased after two weeks compared to baseline
  . On the other hand, a recent study found that consumption of an isoflavone supplement
  for six months had no effect on Ki-67 labeling index compared to placebo, although
  there was a significant decrease in both treatment and placebo groups compared to
  baseline . There was also no change in the rate of atypical cytology. \n\n\n\nRCTs
  were assessed as having a moderate risk of bias, with inadequate reporting of random
  sequence generation and allocation concealment in 18 and 32 of 43 unique RCTs, respectively.
  The majority of RCTs showed low risk of performance bias, detection bias, attrition
  bias, and reporting bias; description of blinding of participants, blinding of outcome
  assessment, complete outcome data and reporting was adequate in over 88% of the
  studies. The risk of bias across studies is shown in Figure S5.\n\n\n\nThe most
  common adverse event associated with soy consumption was mild to moderate gastrointestinal
  discomfort, but this usually occurred with comparable frequency in both the soy
  and the placebo groups ; only in one study was there considerable difference in
  the frequency of GI upset, 47% in the soy group compared to 22% in the control group
  . Amongst all the studies, there was report of only one case of breast cancer recurrence
  that occurred in a soy-allocated subject ; and two new cases of breast cancer and
  one case of endometrial cancer among soy allocated subjects compared to five in
  the control subjects . There were no other serious adverse events. \n\n\n\nSeven
  studies included in our review investigated the effect of soy in combination with
  hormonal therapies: tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors. Four cohort studies  and
  three RCTs  reported no significant differences with respect to treatment outcomes
  or rates of adverse effects associated with use of soy among women who were receiving
  tamoxifen therapy. In one RCT, vaginal spotting was reported in four subjects in
  the soy group compared to one in the placebo group, but with such low numbers, the
  statistical significance of this finding was not reported . \n\nOf the cohort studies,
  the WHEL cohort exhibited relatively low soy isoflavone intake and yielded null
  results: HR for recurrence among tamoxifen users was 0.59 . Guha et al found no
  significant effects overall associated with intake of either ~13mg genistein, ~9.5mg
  daidzein, or ~800mg glycitein, however there was a trend toward a protective effect
  among tamoxifen users, p trend =0.05 . Shu et al examined 5042 breast cancer survivors,
  roughly half of whom were on tamoxifen, and found that both soy protein intake and
  total isoflavone intake were protective against recurrence and death, HR recurrence
  0.66 for protein, and HR 0.74 for isoflavones . When analyzed by receptor status,
  these associations remained significant only among women with ER+ status . Kang
  et al found decreased risk of recurrence among post-menopausal women consuming &gt;42.3mg
  isoflavones in a cohort of breast cancer patients, all of whom were on tamoxifen
  or aromatase inhibitors, AHR 0.67 . \n\nOne cohort study examined soy consumption
  by post-menopausal women who were on anastrozole, and found decreased risk of recurrence
  among those with an intake of &gt;42mg/d isoflavones, AHR 0.65 .\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo
  RCTs pertaining to red clover were included . These investigated the effects of
  the proprietary red clover extract, Promensil®, on hot flashes or estrogen-responsive
  tissues as a surrogate of breast cancer risk, among high risk populations. \n\nIn
  brief, Atkinson et al assessed the effect of red clover on mammographic density
  as well as a panel of other markers of estrogenic activity, in 205 women with an
  increased risk of breast cancer due to their breast density pattern; there was also
  a secondary assessment of hot flashes . Participants were randomized to receive
  40 mg red clover isoflavones or placebo daily for one year. \n\nPowles et al investigated
  the effect of red clover in 401 women with a family history of breast cancer, assessing
  circulating FSH, endometrial thickness, mammographic density, and bone density .
  Participants were randomized to receive 40mg red clover isoflavones or placebo for
  three years. \n\n\n\nResults of the study by Atkinson showed no significant changes
  in hot flash score or mean number of daily hot flashes when groups were compared
  . Nonetheless, it should be noted that this was a secondary endpoint, and that this
  study included women in whom the severity of menopausal symptoms was already low
  at baseline; menopausal symptoms were not present in all subjects. Baseline mean
  number of hot flashes per day was 2.1 +/-2.7 for the treatment group and 2.5 +/-3.0
  in the control group. There was a comparable decrease of -0.8 +/-2.1 at 12 months
  for the red clover group and -1.0 +/-1.8 for the control group, which however was
  not significant. Similar non-statistically significant results were found for the
  menopausal symptom score, a composite of 21 symptoms including night sweats, palpitations,
  tension/ nervousness, irritability, insomnia, and mood alterations scored for severity.
  Adverse events were not reported.\n\n\n\nNeither of the RCTs reported on breast
  cancer incidence rates, however surrogate markers of estrogenic activity were examined.
  Atkinson reported no significant changes in estradiol, FSH, or LH over the one year
  period: estradiol increased by 14.0 pmol/L in the red clover group compared to a
  decrease of 0.9 in the placebo group, however this was not significant, p=0.49);
  FSH decreased 4.2 IU/L in the red clover group compared to a decrease of 2.9 in
  the placebo group, p=0.83; LH decreased 4.0 IU/L in the red clover group compared
  to a decrease of 4.2 IU/L in the placebo group, p=0.71; and tyrosine kinase increased
  1.62 units of activity/ µg protein in the red clover group compared to an increase
  of 0.90 in the placebo group, p=0.16 . \n\nNeither of the two RCTs reported any
  significant changes in mammographic density among both pre- and post-menopausal
  women , and Powles found no significant changes in endometrial thickness between
  groups , though neither of these markers are considered to be highly specific or
  sensitive predictors of breast cancer risk. Atkinson reported a significant interaction
  between treatment group allocation and the ESR1 polymorphism with respect to effect
  on mammographic breast density, with decreases of -3.4 and -5.2 percent among the
  CC and CT genotypes respectively, and a 1.4 increase in the TT group . ESR1 codes
  for the estrogen receptor α, and variations may be associated with risk of breast
  cancer . For instance, CC and CT genotypes may be associated with a small reduction
  in risk of breast cancer compared to TT: CC vs. TT: OR 0.92, 95%CI 0.86-0.99, and
  CC/CT vs. TT: OR 0.95, 95%CI 0.89-1.00 .. It is difficult to predict if or how a
  possible increase in breast density might affect breast cancer risk among TT carriers.\n\n\n\nAtkinson
  did not report adverse events. Powles reported adverse effects, which most commonly
  included breast abnormality, “skin related symptoms”, and other minor adverse events,
  however these were equally distributed between red clover and placebo groups .\n\n\n\nAccording
  to the Cochrane risk of bias tool, the trial reported by Powles was assessed as
  having low risk of bias in all of the categories, except one for which information
  about detection bias was not provided . The trial by Atkinson was assessed as having
  low risk of bias in approximately half of the categories but failed to provide adequate
  information to assess for selection bias, detection bias, and attrition bias . Overall,
  the RCTs were assessed as having low to moderate risk of bias.\n\n\n\nThe results
  of our systematic review suggest that there is a lack of real evidence showing that
  soy increases risk of breast cancer or breast cancer recurrence. This is an important
  finding given the generally perceived controversial status of soy in relation to
  breast cancer . Our review suggests that on the contrary, soy consumption may protect
  against the development of breast cancer , and less so, breast cancer recurrence
  and mortality , although this is based on observational data only. Larger, long-term
  trials are needed to better define these effects. In particular, research is needed
  to more clearly identify possible subgroups of women that may differentially benefit
  from soy or not, based on receptor status and/ or use of anti-estrogen therapy.
  In the meantime, since the overall effect of soy, if any, appears to be protective
  for both breast cancer incidence and recurrence, moderate soy consumption appears
  to be safe and possibly beneficial for most women. \n\nAmong studies included in
  our review, case control studies showed a stronger association between soy and reduced
  risk of breast cancer. As shown in Figures 2 and 3, case control studies were much
  more likely to report significant protective associations between soy intake and
  risk of breast cancer, while prospective studies were less likely to do so. The
  reasons for this are unclear. Although not shown here, we conducted subgroup analysis
  according to the method of exposure assessment to assess for the possibility of
  recall bias. Our analysis showed no clear separation however, between studies utilizing
  food frequency questionnaires, structured interviews, or objective assessments of
  blood or urinary isoflavone concentrations. It is possible that cohort studies were
  not long enough in duration to prospectively capture the true effect of long term
  soy exposure. \n\nThe effect of soy on hot flashes in breast cancer patients is
  not clear. RCTs noted some improvements over time, but not in comparison to placebo
  . This finding may be due to the possibility that soy simply does not possess sufficient
  estrogenic effects to alleviate hot flashes, or due to confounding by concomittant
  usage of tamoxifen in three of five of these studies . There is also the possibility
  that lack of difference between groups may be due to a large placebo effect, since
  hot flashes are a subjective outcome, and up to a 40% improvement was reported by
  the placebo group in one study . Finally, it is possible that soy may in fact possess
  anti-estrogen activity, as suggested by Dorjgochoo et al, who found that higher
  soy consumption was associated with increased prevalence of hot flashes among premenopausal
  breast cancer patients . \n\nSeveral factors influence the biological activity of
  soy isoflavones in the body. First, soy isoflavones show selectivity toward ER-ß
  over ER-α . This is important because ERß appears to be associated with antiproliferative,
  anticarcinogenic effects, while ERα is thought to promote carcinogenesis, and is
  the form measured clinically in the treatment of breast cancer patients . In the
  breast, ERß is found in ductal and lobular epithelial cells as well as stromal cells,
  while ERα is found only in epithelial cells and not stroma of the breast . Moreover,
  ERα is the receptor used to classify ER positive breast cancer, and the one through
  which tamoxifen exerts its antiproliferative effects . Some have suggested that
  ERß functions as a possible tumor suppressor gene, pointing out evidence that ERß
  may control ERα-induced proliferation, and that expression is lost in many breast
  tumors . If soy preferentially activates ERß, this may explain its chemopreventive
  effects. \n\nSecondly, preclinical evidence has shown that under conditions of high
  estrogen concentration similar to premenopausal levels, soy isoflavones act as ER
  antagonists, while under conditions of low estrogen comparable to postmenopausal
  levels, they are ER agonists . In a study of soy and MCF-7 breast cancer cell growth
  as assessed in the presence and absence of estradiol, Imhof et al observed “minor
  proliferation enhancing effects”  that occurred “only at unphysiologically low estrogen
  levels” . According to Imhof, typical in vivo estrogen levels range from 50–400
  pM, with even menopausal estrogen levels exceeding 20 pM, the concentration of genistein
  achieved through supplementation . According to this line of reasoning, at these
  relative concentrations, the agonistic effects of estrogen would be expected to
  outweight those of genistein . It would appear that an important component of interpreting
  these in vitro and in vivo studies is assessing how well they reflect human biological
  conditions. \n\nPlaced in this context, the clinical data reviewed by our study,
  which demonstrates a lack of any clear pro-estrogenic effects from use of soy, is
  quite noteworthy. We found no effects on circulating estradiol, and no measurable
  effects on estrogen-sensitive target tissues, such as breast tissue and endometrium.
  In addition, our findings are in agreement with those reported by Hooper et al in
  a 2009 meta analysis of 47 trials . Hooper found that soy did not significantly
  affect estradiol, estrone, or sex hormone binding globulin, although amongst pre-menopausal
  women there was a significant 20% decrease in LH and FSH . In post-menopausal women
  there were no significant effects on any hormone including estradiol and estrone,
  with a small nonsignificant 14% increase in estradiol based on 21 studies and a
  nonsignificant decrease in estrone. A second meta analysis similarly found no significant
  effects from soy on breast density, also considered a surrogate of breast cancer
  risk . \n\nDespite this, and despite the fact that our study failed to show any
  clear estrogenic effects observable in humans overall, the possibility of soy having
  estrogen-like effects under some circumstances in certain subgroups of women cannot
  be ruled out . Of particular concern is the use of soy among women who are receiving
  antiestrogen therapy. Tamoxifen acts primarily through the ERα while soy is preferential
  toward ERß, which theoretically suggests minimal risk of interaction based on competitive
  receptor binding, however this has not been tested clinically . Some preliminary
  evidence indicates that isoflavones may have synergistic effects with tamoxifen
  in cancer models and may reduce the development of tamoxifen resistance . The in
  vitro receptor binding activity of genistein, daidzein, equol, and their metabolites
  is approximately 3% or less that of estradiol for ERα, and 18% or less for ERß ,
  while the relative transactivation activity of these isoflavones ranged from 55
  to 84% relative to estradiol, compared to 43 to 55% for tamoxifen for both ERα and
  ERß . Nonetheless, caution should be used with using soy alongside tamoxifen until
  there is clinical data demonstrating the safety. \n\nOur review revealed no clear
  modification of soy’s effect based on menopausal status or ER+/- status in breast
  cancer patients in large observational studies. However we did find variation according
  to geographical locale; studies conducted in Asian countries more often reported
  chemopreventive effects compared to studies in Western countries, which more often
  reported null results. We attribute this to a difference in soy consumption between
  these areas. The traditional Japanese diet contains between 6-11g of soy protein
  and 25-50mg isoflavones; top percentiles of soy intake in Asian studies consume
  as much as 20g soy protein or 100mg isoflavones per day , while the cut off for
  the top quartiles of intake among Western populations is in the range of a few hundred
  micrograms per day . \n\nThe suggestion has been made that the effect of soy depends
  on genetic variations present in Asian populations. Nechuta et al conducted an analysis
  of the effect of soy on breast cancer recurrence, investigating the possibility
  of ethnic variations . They reported that in cohorts of American women, after elimination
  of women of Asian-American descent, the inverse association between soy and breast
  cancer recurrence remains, undermining the suggestion that the effect of soy is
  dependent upon genetic difference between ethnicities . \n\n\n\nOur review is broad
  in its scope, assessing soy in the context of breast cancer from several perspectives,
  including risk of breast cancer, risk of recurrence, estrogenic effects, and risk
  of interactions with tamoxifen and other hormonal therapies. Our findings are generally
  in agreement with those of the American Cancer Society, suggesting that moderate
  amounts of soy intake is likely safe for consumption by women with breast cancer
  . \n\n\n\nAlthough we included a large number of studies regarding soy and breast
  cancer risk, we were unable to pool data with respect to risk of breast cancer and
  risk of recurrence due to heterogeneity. There is a lack of long term interventional
  data assessing cancer risk. This is a particularly important shortcoming because
  RCTs of under 2 years duration are unlikely to reveal any serious adverse effects
  in breast cancer survivors, including possible interactions between soy and tamoxifen.
  This question deserves high priority for future research in this area. In addition,
  there is a need to more carefully assess the dose-response relationship between
  soy intake and risk of breast cancer in order to more clearly delineate the threshold
  of exposure needed for potential therapeutic effects. \n\n\n\nSoy does not appear
  to influence levels of circulating estrogen or exert estrogen-like effects at target
  tissues. There is a lack of evidence showing clear effects of soy consumption or
  supplementation on reduction of hot flashes in breast cancer patients. Observational
  data suggest that higher soy intake, consistent with that of a traditional Japanese
  diet, may be protective against the development of breast cancer as well as breast
  cancer recurrence and mortality, although there is a need for clinical studies to
  confirm this relationship. Until there is more data supporting safety, caution is
  warranted with high dose isoflavone supplements in patients with breast cancer.
