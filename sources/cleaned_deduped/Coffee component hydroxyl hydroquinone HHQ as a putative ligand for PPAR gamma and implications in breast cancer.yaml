  breast cancer risk and survival. However, epidemiologic data on the relation between
  coffee compounds and breast cancer survival are sparse and inconsistent. \n\n\n\nWe
  show that coffee component HHQ has significant apoptotic effect on MDA-MB-231 and
  MCF-7 cells in vitro, and that ROS generation, change in mitochondrial membrane
  permeability, upregulation of Bax and Caspase-8 as well as down regulation of PGK1
  and PKM2 expression may be important apoptosis-inducing mechanisms. The results
  suggest that PPARγ ligands may serve as potential therapeutic agents for breast
  cancer therapy. HHQ was also validated as a ligand for PPARγ by docking procedure.
  \n\n\n\nThis is the first report on the anti-breast cancer activity of HHQ. \n\n\n\nBreast
  cancer is the fifth most common cancer globally and accounts for the highest morbidity
  and mortality. It is the second highest occurring cancer in women and one of the
  leading causes of death . Although anti-estrogens have provided an effective endocrine
  therapy, a significant proportion of patients have acquired resistance to these
  drugs. Hence, there is a requirement for alternative therapeutics to treat breast
  cancer. Since, cancer cells modify several pathways to achieve continuous progression
  and survival, and undergo metabolic alterations, it is important that multiple target
  strategies are used to achieve effective treatment. Several drugs that inhibit metabolism
  of cancer cells by targeting a variety of molecules directly or indirectly are currently
  under clinical trials, hence it is important to screen drugs with a potential to
  target critical molecules involved in metabolic transformation . \n\nPPARγ receptor
  is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily which upon ligand activation undergoes
  heterodimerization with retinoic acid-like receptor and is translocated to the nucleus
  where it recognizes a specific sequence - the peroxisome proliferator response element
  located within promoters of target genes, and acts as a transcription regulator
  for genes involved in proliferation, cell differentiation, apoptosis, angiogenesis,
  inflammation, organogenesis, and lipid and carbohydrate metabolism and energy homeostasis
  . Two isoforms of PPARγ have been identified, with a wide tissue distribution among
  various animal species . PPARγ are expressed in a variety of tumor cells and PPARγ
  agonists e.g Thiazolidinediones, and tyrosine based agonists show cytostatic and
  cytotoxic activity against tumor cells in vitro and in vivo brought about by regulating
  proteins involved in growth regulatory pathways and cell cycle . TZDs are also reported
  to induce G0/G1 arrest and apoptosis of malignant cells by upregulation of the tumor
  suppressor p53, and control of DNA repair systems and apoptosis . However, the exact
  mechanism of action and the genes regulated by PPARγ and biological functions of
  this transcription factor are not known and need elucidation. \n\nAlso, due to high
  levels of toxicity associated with TZDs, rosiglitazone, and pioglitazone), and their
  recent withdrawal in several countries, there is a need to search for newer PPAR
  drugs that exhibit better efficacy but lesser toxicity. Phytochemicals in dietary
  components are increasingly being used as nutritional supplements in treatment of
  diseases. Due to the plant origin of these supplements they are considered safe
  for human consumption . Present data reveal that healthy dietary molecules have
  a pleiotropic role and are able to change cell metabolism from anabolism to catabolism,
  modulate energy homeostasis and down regulate inflammation by interacting with enzymes,
  nuclear receptors and transcriptional factors . Towards this end developing and
  positioning known phytochemicals that bind and activate PPARγ with more efficacy
  and safety, while promoting health benefits has become an absolute necessity. Also,
  it is important to identify the dietary molecules able to influence the course of
  the disease, their targets in the cell, and the molecular mechanisms involved. \n\nCoffee
  is one of the most widely consumed beverages in the world. The health-promoting
  properties of coffee are often attributed to its rich phytochemistry, including
  caffeine, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, hydroxyl hydroquinone, etc. More recently,
  coffee consumption has been associated with reductions in the risk of several chronic
  diseases, including type 2 diabetes mellitus, Parkinsons disease and hepatocellular
  disease . The association between coffee intake and breast cancer risk is biologically
  plausible because of its complex make-up of chemicals, e.g., caffeine and polyphenolic
  compounds such as flavonoids and lignans . Among them, the relationship between
  coffee drinking and breast cancer risk holds great interest. Recent meta-analyses
  demonstrate inverse associations between coffee intake and the risk of colon, liver,
  breast, and endometrial cancer . Also, a high daily intake of coffee has recently
  been reported to be associated with a statistically significant decrease in ER-negative
  breast cancer among postmenopausal women . A number of previous epidemiologic studies
  have estimated the association between coffee consumption and breast cancer risk.
  However, the results are inconsistent . Nevertheless, several reports in literature
  suggest that coffee consumption reduces the risk of cancer, but the molecular mechanisms
  of its chemopreventive effects remain unknown. Moreover, the interpretation of these
  data has often been limited to the role that caffeine plays . \n\nHHQ is a natural
  constituent of coffee accounting for main dry matter constituent in roasted beans.
  Studies exploring the effects of this bioactive compound on mammalian cells are
  limited. HHQ was observed to dock and form hydrogen bonds with PDB ID - 2PRG. The
  initial purpose of our investigation is to determine whether HHQ alters the cell
  viability in estrogen dependent human breast cancer and estrogen independent cells
  as a model system. HHQ was observed to decrease cell viability and colony formation
  in a dose-responsive manner and ROS was found to significantly increase in HHQ treated
  cells in a dose-dependent manner in both the cell lines. We examined the involvement
  of ROS signaling components and demonstrated that the selective killing of cancer
  cells is mediated by induction of oxidative stress that leads to apoptosis. These
  findings were complemented by the finding that caspase-8 is upregulated. Since glucose
  utilization provides a constant energy supply, as well as precursors for de novo
  macromolecular biosynthesis, including DNA, RNA, fatty acids and amino acids that
  are essential for cell growth and proliferation, we further investigated the effect
  of HHQ on two key glycolytic genes PGK1 and PKM2 and observed that both the genes
  are repressed in a dose-dependent manner. These data suggest on the apoptotic and
  anti-cancer properties of HHQ via PPARγ. Further investigations on these could possibly
  help us in understanding the molecular mechanisms by which PPARγ regulates disease
  targets specifically in breast cancer and the use of HHQ in breast cancer therapeutics.
  \n\n\n\nUnderstanding the molecular pathways that link tumor biology to the staggering
  array of pathologies and genes is of paramount scientific and medical importance.
  Though, the complexity of the underlying biochemical and molecular mechanisms of
  breast cancer make metabolic reprogramming and transformation in breast cancer unclear,
  many dietary compounds have been identified as potential chemopreventive agents.
  PPARγ is an interesting target for cancer therapy as its expression is elevated
  in tumors and also because PPARγ activation is reported to result in decreased cell
  proliferation, decreased G0/G1 to S phase progression, apoptosis and increased terminal
  differentiation . Also, imbalances in expression of target genes forms the core
  of metabolic syndrome and cancer regulation through atherogenic metabolic triad/lipid
  triad metabolism modulation by PPARs . Concurrently, increased levels of glycolytic
  proteins are observed in plasmas of women with breast cancer as a result of upregulation
  of glycolysis pathway . \n\nIn this paper, we for the first time report on the use
  of coffee component HHQ as a potential ligand for PPARγ and its role in induction
  of apoptosis in breast cancer cells by delineating the glycolytic pathway gene regulation
  by PPARγ activation. \n\n\n\nThe three-dimensional protein structures can be used
  to understand ligand binding and to rationally design novel ligands as prospective
  drug compounds. PPAR agonists typically possess a small polar region and a hydrophobic
  region that form hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions, respectively, within
  the ligand binding domain. Several crystal structures of PPARγ in complexation with
  their ligands are available in the protein data bank. Here, we used the PDB crystal
  structure 2PRG for structure-based identification of HHQ as a potential ligand for
  PPARγ in breast cancer therapeutics. We also compared the ligand binding properties
  of the two compounds Rosiglitazone and HHQ. The rerank scores for the Rosiglitazone
  and HHQ were found to be -122.433 and -33.3562, respectively. The hydrogen bond
  energy values were -5.487 kcal/mol, and -9.460 kcal/mol for Rosiglitazone and HHQ.
  Rosiglitazone forms 3 hydrogen bonds with the 2PRG and HHQ forms 5 hydrogen bonds
  with 2PRG. Hydrogen bonding of the ligand to Tyr473 is reported to be the key to
  the stabilization of the AF-2 region and it has also been shown that  agonistic
  activity of ligands disappears when Tyr473 is mutated. The importance of His323
  and His449 has also been reported . Our results show that both the ligands have
  hydrogen bond interactions with key residues - Tyr473 and His 449, thereby providing
  specificity of interaction that is a fundamental aspect of molecular recognition.
  The active site residues that interact with HHQ are shown in Table 1 and the hydrogen
  bonds between each compound and the 2PRG active site are shown in Figure 1. \n\n\nFigure

  of Rosiglitazone and HHQ in the ligand binding domain of 2PRG. \n\n\n\nTo investigate
  the potential cell growth inhibition of HHQ, we first examined the effect of HHQ
  on cell proliferation and clonogenic survival in human breast adenocarcinomas. For
  this we chose two breast adenocarcinoma cell lines, MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7. MDA-MB-231
  and MCF-7 were cultured in the control medium for 24 h, followed by 48 h treatment
  with different concentrations of HHQ for cytotoxic and anti-proliferative studies.
  HHQ led to decrease in relative density of viable cells as detected by MTT dye reduction
  assay. A dose-effect relationship was observed as shown in Figure 2. The IC-50 value
  for MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 were found to be 25 μM and 50 μM, respectively. We proceeded
  with 12.5 μM and 25 μM of HHQ to investigate the comparable effects of same concentration
  on both the cell lines. At 12.5 μM the relative viability in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7
  was 58.2% and 76.3%, respectively, whereas at 25 μM the relative viability in MDA-MB-231
  and MCF-7 was 50% and 60.7%, respectively. As morphological analyses depict the
  health of a cell, we next examined the cells for any altered morphology on treatment
  with HHQ. Cells cultured in the presence of HHQ show significant morphological changes
  and were found to be reduced in cell mass as well as number as compared to control.
  Also, HHQ treatment induced detachment and rounding in breast cancer cells as shown
  by phase contrast images in both the cell lines). Furthermore, to examine the antitumor
  activity of HHQ on colony forming potential in breast cancer cells we performed
  clonogenic assay. This assay is an in vitro assay based on the ability of a single
  cell to proliferate and differentiate into colonies in response to various insults.
  HHQ severely affected the colony forming potential of human breast cancer cells
  - MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7. As shown in Figure 4A and 4B clonogenicity of both the breast
  cancer lines were found to be significantly reduced in a concentration-dependent
  manner after exposure to HHQ. \n\nFigure 2. Growth curve inhibition as assessed
  by MTT assay in human breast cancer cells and MCF-7). The breast cancer cells were
  exposed to different doses of HHQ for 48 h at 37 °C. The cell viability in breast
  cancer cells decreased in dose-dependent fashion. The IC-50 value for MDA-MB-231
  and MCF-7 were observed to be 25 μM and 50 μM, respectively. Data are representative
  of three independent experiments done in triplicates and expressed as mean ± S.E.M.
  p ; 0.005 represents statistical significant difference between control and HHQ
  test groups. \n\nFigure 3. Phase contrast images of human breast cancer cells. The
  breast cancer cells were exposed to 12.5 µM and 25 µM concentration of HHQ for 48
  h at 37 °C. HHQ treated groups did not retain their normal morphology. HHQ induced
  cell rounding and detachment in breast cancer cells. \n\nFigure 4. The inhibitory
  effects of HHQ on colony formation in human breast cancer cells as evaluated by

  formed. Decrease in number of colonies in HHQ treated groups were statistically
  significant. \n\n\n\nReactive oxygen species is a universal entity mediating apoptosis
  . ROS act as a secondary messenger in cell signaling and are essential for various
  biological processes in normal cells. Disturbances in redox balance relate to human
  pathogenesis including cancers. ROS are constantly generated and eliminated in the
  biological system, and play important roles in a variety of normal biochemical functions
  and abnormal pathological processes. Growing evidence suggests that cancer cells
  exhibit increased intrinsic ROS stress, due in part to oncogenic stimulation, increased
  metabolic activity, and mitochondrial malfunction. Since ROS are chemically active
  and can inflict severe cellular damage, the very fact that cancer cells are under
  increased intrinsic ROS stress may also provide a unique opportunity to kill the
  malignant cells based on their vulnerability to further ROS insults caused by exogenous
  agents . HHQ is earlier reported to generate reactive oxygen species by autoxidation
  . Therefore, to get further insights to HHQ induced cytotoxicity in breast cancer
  cells; we examined the intracellular ROS generation. As shown in Figure 5, intracellular
  ROS formation was found to be significantly increased in HHQ treated cells as compared
  to control cells in a dose-dependent manner. The effective enhancement of ROS production
  by HHQ correlates to its cytotoxicity nature. Since the mitochondrial respiratory
  chain is a major source of ROS generation in the cells, the vulnerability of the
  mitochondrial DNA to ROS mediated damage has been suggested to be a mechanism to
  amplify ROS stress in cancer cells . One major effect is to generate increased intracellular
  ROS causing loss of outer mitochondrial membrane permeability and induction of apoptosis
  . Another possible mechanism by which cancer cells generate increased amounts of
  ROS may involve malfunction of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. The fact that
  cancer cells exhibit an increased dependency on glycolysis to meet their ATP need
  may reflect an inefficient ATP generation in mitochondria, or \"respiration injury\"
  . A correlation between mtDNA mutations and increased ROS contents in primary leukemia
  cells isolated from patients has been shown . Because the mitochondrial respiratory
  chain is the major site of ROS generation due to electron transfer, malfunction
  of the mitochondrial respiratory chain associated with mtDNA mutations is likely
  to result in more free radical production due to increased \"leakage\" in mitochondrial
  membrane. \n\nFigure 5. HHQ induced intracellular ROS production in human breast
  cancer cells, MDA-MB-231  and MCF-7 . The breast cancer cells were treated with
  12.5 μM and 25 μM of HHQ for 48 h at 37 °C, intracellular ROS was detected by a
  fluorescent microscope. Quantitation of the ROS signals in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7
  is shown in  and , respectively. Significant increase in ROS level was observed
  in HHQ treated cells. Data are representative of three independent experiments done
  in triplicates and expressed as mean ± S.E.M. Increase in ROS generation in HHQ
  treated groups with 12.5 μM and 25 μM were statistically significant. \n\n\n\nMitochondria
  are central players in the determination of cell life and death. Their main physiological
  function is energy production by the oxidative phosphorylation pathway. This process
  not only involves production of cell energy currency, ATP but also increases the
  production of reactive oxygen species as by-products of aerobic metabolism. Mitochondria
  are also the main regulators of apoptotic cell death by mediating extrinsic and
  intrinsic apoptotic pathways. Oxidative stress may cause oxidative damage to various
  cellular components and may lead to lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation, mitochondrial
  DNA mutations, initiation of apoptosis cascade by decrease in mitochondrial membrane
  potential and release of apoptogenic factor cytochrome c into the cytosol . Thus,
  the oxidative damage and the associated mitochondrial dysfunction may lead to energy
  depletion, accumulation of cytotoxic mediators, apoptosis and ultimately cell death.
  Therefore to investigate the effect of HHQ induced oxidative stress on mitochondria
  and apoptosis cascade initiation, we undertook mitochondrial membrane potential
  analysis using potential sensitive, cationic dye JC1. This dye exhibits potential-dependent
  accumulation in mitochondria, indicated by a fluorescence emission shift from green
  to red. Consequently, live cells have higher red/green intensity ratio as compared
  to cells undergoing apoptosis. As shown in Figure 6, we observed that the breast
  cancer cells when treated with HHQ show loss of mitochondria membrane potential
  in a dose-dependent manner. This decrease in MMP at 25 μM of HHQ was significant
  in both the cell lines. Furthermore, we found that the level of pro-apoptotic protein
  Bax, significantly increased in a concentration-dependent manner in both the breast
  cancer cells. The expression levels of Bax correlates with the MMP loss in breast
  cancer cells on treatment with HHQ. This protein is involved in the mitochondrial
  apoptotic signaling pathway. The activation of the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family member
  Bax, induces permeabilization of the mitochondrial outer membrane and release of
  cytochrome c leading to caspase dependent apoptosis . Together, these data corroborate
  with our previous results and demonstrate that there is disruption in mitochondrial
  potential, permeability and functioning upon PPARγ activation by HHQ. \n\nFigure
  6. HHQ induced loss in mitochondrial membrane potential in human breast cancer cells.
  The breast cancer cells were treated with 12.5 μM and 25 μM of HHQ for 48 h at 37
  °C and then immunostained for JC1. HHQ treated cells showed loss of MMP comparable
  to that of the control cells. Data are representative of three independent experiments
  done in triplicates and expressed as mean ± S.E.M. p &lt; 0.005 represents statistical
  significant difference between control and HHQ test groups. \n\nFigure 7. Expression
  analyses of pro-apoptotic protein Bax in response to HHQ treatment in human breast
  cancer cells. The breast cancer cells were treated with 12.5 μM and 25 μM of HHQ
  for 48 h at 37 °C. Representative western blot hybridization signals of Bax for
  MDA-MB-231  and MCF-7  and the quantitation of the signals is shown in  and , respectively.
  Significant increase in Bax expression was observed in HHQ treated cells. Data are
  presented as mean ± SEM of three independent experiments. p&lt; 0.005 represents
  statistical significant difference between control and HHQ test groups. \n\n\n\nCaspase-8
  activation is one of the early events leading to apoptosis. PPAR synthetic ligands
  are known to activate intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic cascade . In order to understand
  the mechanism of cell death, we hypothesized that PPARγ ligand HHQ may initiate
  apoptosis cascade via PPARγ dependent pathway. To examine the above hypothesis we
  undertook the expression analysis of apoptotic protein, caspase-8. Interestingly,
  we observed that on treatment with HHQ the level of procaspase-8 decreases significantly
  in both the cancer cells. This demonstrates that caspase-8 proenzyme is being cleaved
  to active caspase-8 fragments in a dose-dependent manner. Concurrent increase in
  proapototic protein Bax, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and activation
  of caspase-8 demonstrate PPARγ dependent apoptotic cascade activation by HHQ. \n\nFigure
  8. Expression analyses of proenzyme caspase-8 in response to HHQ treatment in human
  breast cancer cells. The breast cancer cells were treated with 12.5 μM and 25 μM
  of HHQ for 48 h at 37 °C. Representative western blot hybridization signals for
  proenzyme caspase-8 for MDA-MB-231  and MCF-7  and the quantitation of the signals
  are shown in  and , respectively. Significant decrease in expression of proenzyme
  caspase-8 was observed in HHQ treated cells. Data are presented as mean ± SEM of
  three independent experiments. p&lt; 0.005 represents statistically difference between
  control and HHQ test groups. \n\n\n\nIn 1930, Otto Warburg discovered the unknown
  link between highly proliferative nature of cancer cells and glycolysis. The phenomenon
  involved was described as the \"Warburg Effect\" which is characterized by increased
  glucose uptake and dependence on glycolysis for ATP production even in the presence
  of oxygen source. The glycolytic rate of rapidly proliferating tumor cells was found
  to be 200 times higher than those of their normal tissues of origin. Altenberg and
  Greulich found over expression of glycolytic genes in 24 different types of cancer
  including breast cancer. Two such glycolytic genes are phosphoglycerate kinase 1
  and tumor specific pyruvate kinase muscle 2 . PGK1 and PKM2 catalyze the sixth and
  ninth step, respectively, in the glycolysis pathway generating two ATPs each. PGK1
  also functions as a polymerase alpha cofactor protein and is involved in DNA synthesis.
  PKM2 on the other hand is also a metabolic regulator and is also reported to be
  involved in channelization of glucose carbons to biosynthetic processes and hence
  control glycolysis. Hence, down regulating these enzymes would not only starve the
  cells for ATP but also lead to biosynthetic metabolite starvations, as they are
  important for tumor cell proliferation and survival. Earlier, we reported that both
  phosphoglycerate kinase 1 and pyruvate kinase M2 are repressed by PPARγ in the same
  two breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7. Further analysis suggested that
  this repression leads to decrease in ATP levels and apoptosis . Here, we hypothesized
  that HHQ can modulate the expression of PGK1 and PKM2 via PPARγ dependent pathway.
  Therefore, to test this hypothesis, we undertook expression analysis of these metabolic
  enzymes. We observed that the expression of glycolytic genes, PGK1 and PKM2 was
  significantly reduced in both the breast cancer cells on treatment with HHQ in dose-dependent
  manner, Figure 9, 10. Further, to confirm the repression of glycolytic genes, PGK1
  and PKM2 through HHQ induced PPARγ activation, we utilized GW9662, an irreversible
  PPARγ antagonist which acts by binding to the human ligand-binding domain. As shown
  in Figure 11, no significant repression of PGK1 and PKM2 was seen on pre-treating
  the breast cancer cells with GW9662 followed by HHQ. GW9662 showed no effect of
  HHQ on expression of PGK1 and PKM2, thereby suggesting that the activation of PPARγ
  is required for repression of these enzymes. Conversely, these data suggests that
  HHQ represses the expression of glycolytic enzymes via PPARγ dependent pathway.
  Down regulation of PGK1 and PKM2 decreases ATP production in the cytoplasm and mitochondria,
  initiating apoptosis and suppressing cancer metabolism. ATP depletion, used in combination
  with chemotherapy and/or radiation, has a variety of effects on cancer cells including
  inducing apoptosis in multi-drug resistant cells and decreasing tumor promotion.
  Cellular ATP level has been reported as an important determinant of cell death .
  Though the exact mechanisms of these effects have not been fully elucidated, these
  investigations suggest on the role of HHQ as an anti-cancer agent. However, further
  work is required to establish the exact nature and behavior of this molecule in
  conjunction with other coffee components and to determine its relevance to the biological
  role of PPARγ breast cancer progression and therapeutics. \n\nFigure 9. Expression

  μM and 25 μM of HHQ for 48 h at 37 °C. Representative western blot hybridization
  signals for PGK1  and PKM2  for both the breast cancer cell lines and the quantitation
  of the signals is shown in  and , respectively. GW9662 showed no effect of HHQ on
  expression of PGK1 and PKM2, thereby suggesting that the activation of PPARγ is
  required for repression of these enzymes. Data are representative of three independent
  experiments and expressed as mean ± S.E.M. \n\n\n\nOur results have established
  previously unknown novel cross-link between HHQ, PPARγ, ROS and glycolysis; thereby
  adding a new dimension to therapeutic potential of PPARγ ligands. Although the exact
  mechanism remains unclear and further studies are still needed to clarify the potential
  role and molecular basis of action of PPARγ in breast carcinogenesis, our investigation
  open a new direction for development HHQ in breast cancer treatment. Further investigations
  on these could possibly help us in understanding the molecular mechanisms by which
  PPARγ regulates disease targets specifically in breast cancer and the use of its
  ligands in breast cancer therapeutics. Despite several advancements that have been
  made on the subject, there is still much to be clarified regarding PPARγ signaling
  in breast cancer and several important questions remain unanswered. Many intriguing
  avenues of PPARγ research have been opened and hold the potential to ultimately
  lead to newer classes of more selective molecules. \n\n\n\n\n\nDocking studies were
  carried out using MolDock™ which is based on a new heuristic search algorithm that
  combines differential evolution with a cavity prediction algorithm. The PDB file
  for the crystal structure of PPARγ was downloaded from http://www.rcsb.org webcite
  and transferred into the workspace keeping the orientation as a control. The energy
  between the existing ligand and protein was subsequently minimized. Both protein
  and ligands were optimized in the workspace for docking by the addition of hydrogens.
  All structural water molecules were removed from the protein molecules using protein
  preparation wizard. Binding sites in the electrostatic surface of the protein was
  identified using the grid based cavity prediction algorithm. A total of five cavities
  were detected and the prepositioned ligand in the active site cavity was identified
  and the docking was constrained to the predicted active site cavity. MolDock™ scoring
  function is used for evaluating the energy between the ligand and the protein target.
  Grid resolution, number of runs, population size, maximum iterations, scaling factor,
  and cross over rate were set as 0.30 Å, 10, 50, 2000, 0.5, 0.9, respectively, for
  each run. Multiple poses were returned for each run with the RMSD threshold set
  to 1.00 Å. The pose with the highest rerank score was retained in the workspace
  for detailed evaluation of the ligand binding at the active site cavity. MVD was
  installed in Windows vista operating system on an Intel Core 2. \n\n\n\nDulbeccos
  modified eagles medium, Fetal bovine serum, HHQ, GW9662 and crystal violet were
  purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Penicillin-Streptomycin-Neomycin antibiotic mixture,
  Hoechst 33258 and the Image-iTTM LIVE Green Reactive Oxygen Species detection reagents
  were procured from Invitrogen and JC-1dye from Biotium. Sodium chloride, Tris base,
  potassium chloride, sodium di hydrogen phosphate, glycine and sodium phosphate di
  basic were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries. \n\n\n\nThe human breast
  adenocarcinoma cell lines MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 were purchased from the American
  Type Culture Collection. The carcinoma cultures were maintained in Dulbeccos modified
  eagles medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and PNS antibiotic mixture
  100 ng/ml at 37 °C and 5% CO2/95% O2. Cultures at about 50% confluency were treated
  with 12.5 µM and 25 µM of HHQ concentration for 48 h at 37 °C and for PPARγ activity
  inhibition studies, the breast cancer cells were pre-treated with GW9662 followed
  by HHQ and harvested for further use. \n\n\n\nHHQ was tested for its anti-proliferative
  activity on MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells using the 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,
  5-diphenyltetrazolium bromides test following manufacturers instructions. The MTT
  metabolic activity is a colorimetric cell proliferation assay that identifies living
  cells, and is based on the cellular conversion of a tetrazolium salt into insoluble
  formazan, which can be quantified by spectrophotometry. 5 × 103 cells/ well were
  plated in 96-well plates and grown for 24 h. The cells were then exposed to varying
  concentrations of HHQ for 48 h to find the half maximal inhibitory concentration
  values. The intensity of the reduced dye that corresponds to the viable cells was
  measured at reference wavelength of 570 nm by Thermo Scientific Varioskan Flash
  Multimode Reader. Morphological changes in breast cancer cells treated with 12.5
  µM and 25 µM of HHQ concentration for 48 h were examined by phase contrast microscopy.
  All experiments were performed in triplicates, and the relative cell viability was
  expressed as a percentage relative to the untreated control cells. \n\n\n\nColony
  formation potential of human breast cancer cells on exposure to HHQ was assessed
  by clonogenic assay. Clonogenic assay is a cell survival assay based on the ability
  of a single cell to grow into a colony. To determine long-term effects, breast cancer
  cells were treated with 12.5 µM and 25 µM of HHQ concentration for 48 h. At the
  end of treatment the breast cancer cells were then plated at a concentration of
  100 cells/well in a new 6-well plate. The cells were allowed to grow for 14 days
  to form colonies. Fresh medium was replaced every third day. The colonies were washed
  with PBS and fixed in pre-chilled methanol: acetone mixture for 10 min at room temperature.
  The colonies were then stained with crystal violet dye at room temperature for overnight.
  Cells were washed with water and plates were photographed with image scanner. Quantitative
  analysis of the total number of colonies was performed with Image J software. \n\n\n\nThe
  reactive oxygen species were detected by fluorescent staining using the Image-iTTM
  LIVE Green Reactive Oxygen Species Detection Kit. The assay is based on a nonfluorescent
  and cell permeable 5-(and-6)-carboxy-2,7-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate. The
  carboxy-H2DCFDA permeates the live cells and is deacetylated by intracellular esterases.
  The reduced fluorescein compound is oxidized by the cellular ROS and emits bright
  green fluorescence with excitation/ emission maxima of 495/529 nm. The cells were
  grown on glass cover slips placed in 12-well plate and were treated with 12.5 µM
  and 25 µM concentration of HHQ for 48 h. Subsequently, cells were fixed and then
  stained for ROS by following manufacturers instructions. The images were analyzed
  with AxioVision software. \n\n\n\nMitochondrial transmembrane potential was investigated
  using a fluorochrome, JC-1 dye. JC-1 dye exhibits potential-dependent accumulation
  of red fluorescent J-aggregates in energized mitochondria. JC-1 exists as a green
  fluorescent monomer and also accumulates as J-aggregates in the active mitochondria,
  which stain red. Consequently, healthy cells will exhibit high red/green fluorescence
  intensity ratio. In apoptotic cells, mitochondrial depolarization is indicated by
  a decrease in the red/green fluorescence intensity ratio. Therefore this fluorescence
  emission shift from green to red is indicative of mitochondrial depolarization occurring
  during apoptosis. After 48 h of 12.5 µM and 25 µM of HHQ treatment, the cells were
  incubated with 1X JC-1 dye at 37 °C for 15 min followed by washes with assay buffer.
  The red fluorescence and green fluorescence were measured using fluorescence Thermo
  Scientific Varioskan Flash Multimode plate reader. The ratio of red fluorescence
  to green fluorescence was determined in JC-1 stained cells. The relative mitochondrial
  membrane potential was expressed as a percentage relative to the untreated control
  cells. \n\n\n\nIn order to find out the modulation of test proteins by HHQ through
  PPARγ, the test protein were immunostained. For immunostaining, cells were plated
  on glass coverslips in a 12-well plate. The cells were allowed to attach for 24
  h and then exposed to 12.5 µM and 25 µM of HHQ for 48 h. At the end of treatment
  cells were washed with cold PBS three times and then fixed with pre-chilled methanol:
  acetone mixture for 10 min at room temperature. Fixed cells were washed twice with
  PBS, permeabilized with 0.32% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min and blocked with 2%
  bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min. The cells were then probed with anti-PGK1,
  anti-PKM2, antibodies for overnight at 4°C. After primary antibody incubation the
  cells were washed thrice with 0.1% PBST, and then incubated with secondary antibodies
  for 1 h at room temperature followed by 3 times washing with 0.1% PBST and then
  once with PBS. The coverslips were then mounted with ProLong+® Gold antifade reagent
  and observed under a microscope. The experiment was carried out in duplicate in
  three independent experiments. The images were analyzed with Axio Vision software.
  \n\n\n\nExpression level of indicated proteins was examined by Western blotting.
  The control and treated cells were lysed in RIPA lysis buffer, 1% NP-40, 1% sodium
  deoxycholate, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS) complemented with complete protease inhibitors
  for 15 min on ice followed by centrifugation at 14,000 g for 15 min at 4 °C. The
  protein concentration was determined using BCA reagents. Protein lysate was resolved
  in 10% in SDS-polyacrylamide gel under standard denaturing conditions according
  to Laemmlis method followed by transfer onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes
  using a Trans-Blot SD semi-dry electroblotter for 30 min at 20 V. Subsequently,
  the membranes were blocked for 45 min at room temperature with 2% bovine serum albumin
  in 0.1% PBST. The membranes were then probed with anti-PGK1, anti-PKM2, anti-caspase-8,
  Anti-Bax and anti-β-actin at 4°C overnight followed by three washes for 5 min each
  with 0.1% PBST. The membranes were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase conjugated
  secondary antibody for 45 min at RT and washed thrice for 5 min each with 0.1% PBST
  followed by chemiluminescent detection using Luminescent Image Analyzer equipped
  with charge-coupled device camera. \n\n\n\nThe captured images for ROS assay and
  immunostaining were analyzed using AxioVision software. The analysis determined
  the overall density of ROS, PGK1 and PKM2 immunoreactivity in 5-8 randomly selected
  fields in each slide. The mean intensity of ROS, PGK1, and PKM2 immunoreactivity
  in control and treated cells were evaluated and presented as a histogram. Similarly
  the Relative Optical Density for immunoreactive bands in western blotting for PGK1,
  PKM2 and Caspase-8 were analyzed using Image J software. \n\n\n\nThe quantitative
  data are representative of three independent experiments done in triplicates and
  expressed as mean ± SEM. Statistical analysis was performed using analysis of variance
  followed by Bonferronis on test to determine differences in mean and p &lt; 0.05
  was considered as statistically significant. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMKS, YN designed the
