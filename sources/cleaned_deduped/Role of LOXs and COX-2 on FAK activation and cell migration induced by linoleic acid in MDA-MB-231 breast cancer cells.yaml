  of LOXs and COX-2 on FAK activation and cell migration induced by linoleic acid

text: '


  Epidemiological studies and animal models suggest a link between high levels of
  dietary fat intake and an increased risk of developing breast cancer. Particularly,
  free fatty acids  are involved in several processes, including proliferation, migration
  and invasion, in breast cancer cells. Linoleic acid  is a dietary n-6 polyunsaturated
  fatty acid that is known to induce proliferation and invasion in breast cancer cells.
  So far, however, the contribution of LA to focal adhesion kinase  activation and
  cell migration in breast cancer cells has not been studied.


  Here, we show that LA promotes FAK and Src activation, as well as cell migration,
  in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. FAK activation and cell migration require Src,
  Gi/Go, COX-2 and LOXs activities, whereas both are independent of 6 desaturase activity.
  In addition, we show that cell migration requires FAK activity, whereas FAK activation
  requires Src activity, thus suggesting a reciprocal catalytic activation mechanism
  of FAK and Src.


  In summary, our findings show that LA induces FAK activation and cell migration
  in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells.


  Epidemiological studies and animal models suggest an association between high levels
  of dietary fat intake and an increased risk of developing breast cancer. Free fatty
  acids  bind to nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors  and mediate
  gene expression related to glucose and lipid metabolism. In the mammary gland FFAs
  are utilized as a source of energy and for milk lipid synthesis, whereas in breast
  cancer cells FFAs induce cellular processes independent of PPARs including proliferation,
  migration and invasion. The major polyunsaturated fatty acid  in most diets is linoleic
  acid, which is an omega-6 essential fatty acid that contributes to the development
  of chronic diseases. LA is metabolized through a variety of pathways including the
  conversion to arachidonic acid, which is the precursor of a variety of eicosanoids
  such as prostaglandins. Inflammatory diseases increase the risk of developing various
  types of cancer, and a hallmark of cancer-related inflammation includes the presence
  in tumor tissue of inflammatory cells and inflammatory mediators such as chemokines,
  cytokines and PGs. In breast cancer cells, LA induces the expression of plasminogen
  activator inhibitor-1, cell proliferation and invasion, whereas it induces an epithelial-mesenchymal-transition
  -like process in non-tumorigenic MCF10A mammary epithelial cells.


  Focal adhesions are the sites where integrins mediate adhesion links to the actin
  cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix. The components of focal adhesions are
  diverse and include scaffolding proteins, GTPases and kinases. Focal adhesion kinase  is
  a 125 kDa protein tyrosine kinase localized to focal adhesions that can be activated
  by multiple agonists. It has been implicated in the regulation of cell spreading,
  differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, migration, invasion, survival and angiogenesis.
  The activation of FAK is mediated by autophosphorylation at tyrosine-397, which
  creates a binding site for Src kinase and other downstream signaling effectors.
  Subsequently, Src mediates the phosphorylation of FAK at Tyr-576 and Tyr-577, which
  are localized in the activation domain. These latter phosphorylations are important
  for a maximal activation of FAK and its downstream signaling events. Moreover, the
  Src-FAK complex can regulate the phosphorylation of other proteins involved in the
  regulation of cell migration, including p130Cas and paxillin.


  In the present study we investigated whether LA induces FAK activation and cell
  migration, as also the role of LOXs and COX-2 in these processes. Our results show,
  for the first time, that LA promotes FAK activation and cell migration through a
  Src, Gi/Go, COX-2 and LOXs activity-dependent pathway in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer
  cells. In addition, we show that cell migration requires FAK activity, whereas FAK
  activation requires Src activity, thus suggesting a reciprocal catalytic activation
  mechanism of FAK and Src.


  LA sodium salt  and Bordetella pertussis toxin  were obtained from Sigma. FAK antibody  C-20,
  Src Ab N-16 and SC-26196 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.. Phosphospecific
  Abs to Tyr-397 and Tyr-577 of FAK, as well as phosphospecific Ab to Tyr-418 of Src  were
  obtained from Invitrogen. PP2, PP3, U73122, nordihydroguaiaretic acid, 5-bromo-2--3-phenyl)
  thiophene  and N-{-4--1--pyrrolidin-2-ylmethyl}-3-acrylamide,HCl  were obtained
  from Calbiochem-Novabiochem.


  MDA-MB-231 and ZR-75 breast cancer cells were cultured in Dulbeccos modified Eagles
  medium  supplemented with 3.7 g/l sodium bicarbonate, 5 % fetal bovine serum  and
  antibiotics, in a humidified atmosphere containing 5 % CO2 and 95 % air at 37 C.
  For experimental purposes, cells were serum-starved for 12 h before treatment.


  Confluent cultures were washed twice with phosphate buffered saline, equilibrated
  in DMEM at 37 C for at least 30 min and then treated with inhibitors and/or LA.
  LA stock solution  preparation and stimulation were performed as described previously.
  Briefly, LA sodium salt was dissolved in methanol, and the resulting LA stock solution
  was added to the culture dishes in concentrations and times as indicated. For Western
  blot assays, the stimulation was terminated by aspirating the medium, after which
  the cells were solubilized in 0.5 ml ice-cold RIPA buffer. The protein content of
  each sample was determined by the micro Bradford protein assay.


  Equal amounts of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE using 8 % and 10 % separating
  gels followed by transfer to nitrocellulose membranes. After transfer, membranes
  were blocked using 5 % non-fat dried milk in PBS pH 7.2/0.1 % Tween 20, and incubated
  overnight at 4 C with primary Ab. Next, the membranes were washed three times with
  wash buffer and incubated with secondary Ab   for 2 h at room temperature. After
  washing three times with wash buffer, immunoreactive bands were visualized using
  an ECL detection reagent. Autoradiograms were scanned and the labeled bands were
  quantified using the Image J software.


  Cells were grown to confluence in 35-mm culture dishes, starved for 12 h in DMEM,
  and treated for 2 h with mitomycin C  to inhibit proliferation during the experiment.
  Cultures were scratch-wounded using a sterile 200-l pipette tip, washed twice with
  PBS and re-fed with DMEM in the absence or presence of inhibitors and/or LA. The
  progress of cell migration into the wound space was photographed at 48 h using an
  inverted microscope coupled to a camera. Each experiment was repeated three times.


  Cell migration assays were performed in 24-well plates containing 12 cell culture
  inserts with 8 m pore size. Cells were starved for 12 h in DMEM, treated for 2 h
  with 40 M mitomycin C and then treated with inhibitors. Cells were re-suspended
  in DMEM and seeded into the upper chamber at 1  105 cells/well. DMEM, inhibitors
  and/or LA were added to the lower chamber at the indicated concentrations, and both
  the upper and lower chambers contained DMEM. After 48 h of incubation at 37 C, non-migrated
  cells were removed from the upper side of the membrane with cotton swabs, and cells
  on the lower surface of the membrane were fixed in cold methanol for 5 min. Subsequently,
  the membrane was stained with 0.1 % crystal violet in PBS. The dye was eluted with
  200 l of 10 % acetic acid, and the absorbance at 600 nm was measured. Background
  values were obtained from wells without cells.


  To exogenously express FRNK  in MDA-MB-231 cells, cell cultures were transfected
  with 8 g of plasmid using Lipofectamine 2000 Reagent  according to the manufacturers
  instructions. Following transfection, cells were incubated with complete medium
  for 24 h. Cells were serum-starved for 12 h and subsequently migration assays were
  performed.


  Results were expressed as mean  S.D. Data were statistically analyzed using one-way
  ANOVA and Knewman-Keulss multiple comparison tests. A statistical probability of
  P ; 0.05 was considered significant.


  Previously, we demonstrated that AA promotes FAK activation and cell migration in
  breast cancer cells. Here, we examined whether LA induces FAK activation through
  its phosphorylation at Tyr-397. To this end, MDA-MB-231 cells were treated for 5
  min with increasing concentrations of LA and lysed. Cell lysates were analyzed by
  Western blotting with anti-p-FAK Ab. As shown in Fig. 1a, treatment of cells with
  LA induced an increase in FAK phosphorylation at Tyr-397, reaching at maximum at
  90 and 120 M LA. Moreover, LA induced an increase in p-FAK in a time-dependent manner,
  reaching its maximum between 5 and 10 min of treatment. Anti-FAK and anti-actin
  Ab were used as loading controls.

  treated with increasing concentrations of linoleic acid  for 5 min and lysed. Panel
  b, c and d. MDA-MB-231 and Zr-75 cells were treated with 90 M LA for various times
  and lysed. Lysates were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-p-FAK Ab or with
  anti-p-FAK-Tyr577. The membranes were analyzed further by Western blotting with
  anti-FAK and anti-actin Ab as loading controls. The graphs represent the mean  S.D.
  and are expressed as the fold p-FAK or p-FAK-Tyr577 above unstimulated cells value.

  To further substantiate the notion that LA induces FAK activation, we examined whether
  LA promotes FAK phosphorylation at Tyr-577. To this end, MDA-MB-231 cells were treated
  with 90 M LA for various times and lysed. The cell lysates were analyzed by Western
  blotting with anti-p-FAK-Tyr577 Ab. Our findings show that LA induces an increase
  in FAK phosphorylation at Tyr-577  in a time-dependent manner.


  In addition, we examined whether LA induces p-FAK in Zr-75 breast cancer cells.
  Cultures of these cells were stimulated with 90 M LA for various times and subsequently
  lysed. Cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-p-FAK Ab. In agreement
  with our previous results, stimulation of ZR-75 cells with LA induced an increase
  of p-FAK in a time-dependent manner.


  Next we determined whether LA induces cell migration. Therefore, MDA-MB-231 cells
  were cultured to confluence and treated with 40 M mitomycin C for 2 h. Cell cultures
  were scratch-wounded and treated with increasing concentrations of LA for 48 h.
  As shown in Fig. 2a, cells treated with LA showed a significantly increased migration
  pattern toward the middle of the scratch compared to untreated cells, reaching a
  maximum at 90 M LA.


  LA induces cell migration in MDA-MB-231 cells. Panel a. MDA-MB-231 cells were grown
  in 35 mm dishes, and pretreated with 40 M mitomycin C for 2 h. Cell cultures were
  scratch-wounded and treated for 48 h with serum-free DMEM containing increasing
  concentrations of LA. Pictures were taken at 48 h after wounding. Panel b. MDA-MB-231
  cells were transfected with a FRNK construct or with an empty vector. Cells were
  lysed and FRNK expression was analyzed by Western blotting using anti-FAK Ab. FAK
  and FRNK are indicated by arrows. Panel c. Cultures of MDA-MB-231 cells  and cells
  transfected with FRNK or with empty vector were pretreated with 40 M mitomycin C
  for 2 h. Cell cultures were scratch-wounded and treated for 48 h with serum-free
  DMEM containing 90 M LA. Pictures were taken at 48 h after wounding. The results
  shown are representative of at least three independent experiments


  Next, the role of FAK on cell migration induced by LA was analyzed. For this purpose,
  FAK function was inhibited using a dominant-negative FAK construct, FRNK, consisting
  of amino acids 668-1053 of wild type FAK. MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with
  the FRNK construct and lysed. Cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting with
  anti-FAK Ab, which recognizes the C-terminus of FAK and is recommended for detection
  of FAK and FRNK. Our results show that cells transfected with the FRNK construct
  expressed FRNK, whereas cells transfected with an empty control vector and cells
  without transfection did not express FRNK. In order to determine the role of FAK
  on cell migration, MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with the FRNK construct were treated
  with 40 M mitomycin C for 2 h. Next, cell cultures were scratch-wounded and treated
  with 90 M LA for 48 h. Our results show that FAK activity inhibition completely
  inhibits cell migration induced by LA.


  In order to determine the contribution of Src family members on FAK activation and
  cell migration induced by LA, we first investigated whether LA regulates Src activation
  through its phosphorylation at Tyr-418. Therefore, MDA-MB-231 cells were stimulated
  with 90 M LA for various times and lysed. Cell lysates were analyzed by Western
  blotting with anti-p-Src Ab. As illustrated in Fig. 3a, some Src phosphorylation
  at Tyr-418  was detected in unstimulated cells. Subsequent treatment with LA induced
  an increase in p-Src in a time-dependent manner, which reached a maximum between
  3 and 5 min and declined toward base-line levels at 10 min of treatment.


  LA induces FAK activation and cell migration through a Src family members-dependent
  pathway. Panel a. MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with 90 M LA for various times and
  lysed. Lysates were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-p-Src Ab. The membranes
  were analyzed further by Western blotting with anti-Src and anti-actin Ab as loading
  controls. Panel b and c. MDA-MB-231 cells were treated without  or with  10 M PP2
  or 10 M PP3 for 30 min, stimulated with 90 M LA for 5 min and lysed. Lysates were
  analyzed by Western blotting with anti-p-FAK Ab. The membranes were analyzed further
  by Western blotting with anti-FAK and anti-actin Ab as loading controls. Panel d.
  MDA-MB-231 cells were grown in 35 mm dishes, pretreated with 40 M mitomycin C for
  2 h and for 30 min with 10 M PP2 or 10 M PP3. Cell cultures were scratch-wounded
  and treated for 48 h with serum-free DMEM containing 90 M LA. Pictures were taken
  at 48 h after wounding. Panel e. MDA-MB-231 cells were pretreated with 40 M mitomycin
  C for 2 h and without  or with  10 M PP2 or 10 M PP3 for 30 min and cell migration
  assays were performed by using the Boyden chamber method without  or with  treatment
  with 90 M LA for 48 h. The graph represents the mean  S.D. and is expressed as fold
  migration above unstimulated cells value. Asterisks denote comparisons made to unstimulated
  cells. P &lt; 0.01


  Next, we studied the role of Src family kinases on FAK activation and cell migration
  induced by LA. To this end, MDA-MB-231 cells were treated for 30 min with 10 M PP2,
  a selective inhibitor of Src family members, or with 10 M PP3, which is a structurally
  related but inactive analog of PP2, and then stimulated with 90 M LA for 5 min.
  Cells were lysed and FAK activation was determined by Western blotting with anti-p-FAK
  Ab. As illustrated in Fig. 3b and c, treatment of cells with PP2 completely inhibited
  p-FAK, whereas treatment with PP3 did not interfere with p-FAK induced by LA.


  We next examined the contribution of Src family members on cell migration induced
  by LA. For this end, MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with 40 M mitomycin C for 2 h
  and then with 10 M PP2 or 10 M PP3 for 30 min. Cell cultures were scratch-wounded
  and stimulated with 90 M LA for 48 h. Our results show that treatment of cells with
  PP2 completely inhibited cell migration, whereas treatment with PP3 did not inhibit
  cell migration induced by LA.


  To further substantiate our results, cell migration assays were performed by using
  the Boyden Chamber method. In agreement with our previous results, treatment of
  cells with PP3 did not inhibit cell migration, whereas treatment with PP2 inhibitor
  completely inhibited cell migration induced by LA.


  AA is known to induce FAK activation and cell migration via LOXs activity in breast
  cancer cells. Here, we studied the role of COX-2 and LOXs on FAK activation and
  cell migration induced by LA. First, MDA-MB-231 cells were treated for 24 h with
  10 M NDGA or 5 M DuP-697, which are selective inhibitors of LOXs and COX-2, respectively,
  and stimulated with 90 M LA for 5 min. Next, cells were lysed and FAK activation
  was analyzed by Western blotting with anti-p-FAK Ab. Our findings show that inhibition
  of LOXs and COX-2 activities partly inhibited p-FAK induced by LA.


  Role of COX-2 and LOXs on FAK activation and cell migration. Panel a. MDA-MB-231
  cells were treated for 24 h without  or with  10 M NDGA or 5 M DuP-697, stimulated
  with 90 M LA for 5 min and lysed. Cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting
  with anti-p-FAK Ab. The membranes were analyzed further by Western blotting with
  anti-FAK and anti-actin Ab as loading controls. Panel b and c. MDA-MB-231 cells
  were treated without  or with  10 M NDGA or 5 M DuP-697 for 24 h and with 40 M mitomycin
  C for 2 h. Cell migration assays were performed by using the scratch wound assay  or
  Boyden chamber method  without  or with  treatment with 90 M LA for 48 h. The graphs
  represent the mean  S.D. and are expressed as the fold p-FAK  or migration  above
  unstimulated cells value. Asterisks denote comparisons made to unstimulated cells
  P &lt; 0.05, P &lt; 0.01, P &lt; 0.001


  In order to subsequently determine the role of LOXs and COX-2 on cell migration,
  MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with 10 M NDGA or 5 M DuP-697 for 24 h and then with
  40 M mitomycin C for 2 h. Cells were stimulated with 90 M LA for 48 h and migration
  was analyzed by using the scratch wound assay and the Boyden chamber method. As
  shown in Fig. 4b and c, inhibition of LOXs activity completely inhibited cell migration,
  whereas COX-2 inhibition partly inhibited cell migration induced by LA.


  It has been well-established that the calcium-dependent cytosolic group IVA PLA2  is
  a critical enzyme involved in AA release, and is the only enzyme that releases AA
  directly in a single step reaction. Here, we determined whether p-FAK induced by
  LA requires cPLA2 activity. To this end, MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with 1 M
  cPLA2I  for 30 min and then stimulated with 90 M LA for 5 min. Cells were lysed
  and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-p-FAK Ab. Our results show that treatment
  of cells with cPLA2I did not inhibit the increase in p-FAK induced by LA.


  FAK activation induced by LA requires PLC activity. MDA-MB-231 cells were treated
  without  or with  1 M cPLA2I for 30 min  or with 2 M U73122 for 24 h, stimulated
  with 90 M LA for 5 min and lysed. Cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting
  with anti-p-FAK Ab. The membranes were analyzed further by Western blotting with
  anti-FAK and anti-actin Ab as loading controls. The graphs represent the mean  S.D.
  and are expressed as the fold p-FAK above unstimulated cells value. Asterisks denote
  comparisons made to unstimulated cells. P &lt; 0.05, P &lt; 0.01


  Alternatively, it is known that phospholipase C  releases AA from the phospholipid-bound
  form. Here, we studied whether p-FAK induced by LA requires PLC activity. For this,
  MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with 2 M U73122  for 24 h, and then stimulated with
  90 M LA for 5 min. Next, cells were lysed and analyzed by Western blotting with
  anti-p-FAK Ab. As shown in Fig. 5b, treatment of cells with the PLC inhibitor completely
  inhibited p-FAK induced by LA.


  AA is synthesized from LA through a sequential series of enzymatic conversions,
  where 6 desaturation, which is mediated by 6 desaturase, is the rate-limiting step.
  Here, we studied the role of 6 activity on FAK activation and cell migration induced
  by LA. To this end, cells were treated for 3 h with 2 M sc-26196, which is a specific
  inhibitor of 6 desaturase, stimulated with 90 M LA, and then FAK activation and
  cell migration were assessed. FAK activation was analyzed by Western blotting of
  cell lysates using the anti-p-FAK Ab, and cell migration was studied by using the
  scratch-wound assay and the Boyden chamber method. Our results show that treatment
  with sc-26196 inhibitor did not inhibit FAK activation and cell migration induced
  by LA.


  LA induces FAK activation and cell migration through a 6 desaturase-independent
  pathway. Panel a and d. MDA-MB-231 cells were treated for 3 h without  or with  2
  M sc-26196 or for 12 h without or with 100 ng/ml PTX, stimulated with 90 M LA for
  5 min and lysed. Cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-p-FAK
  Ab. The membranes were analyzed further by Western blotting with anti-FAK and anti-actin
  Ab as loading controls. The graphs represent the mean  S.D. and are expressed as
  the fold p-FAK above unstimulated cells value. Panel b, c, e and f. MDA-MB-231 cells
  were treated for 2 h with 40 M mitomycin C and with 2 M sc-26196 for 3 h or with
  100 ng/ml PTX for 12 h. Cell migration assays were performed by using the scratch
  wound assay  or Boyden chamber method  without  or with  treatment with 90 M LA
  for 48 h. The graphs represent the mean  S.D. and are expressed as the fold migration
  above unstimulated cells value. Asterisks denote comparisons made to unstimulated
  cells. P &lt; 0.05, P &lt; 0.01, P &lt; 0.001


  Eicosanoids  produced by AA metabolism are released from the cells and exert their
  biological effects through interaction with G protein-coupled receptors. Here, we
  studied the role of Gi/Go proteins on FAK activation and cell migration induced
  by LA. MDA-MB-231 cells were treated for 12 h with 100 ng/ml PTX, an inhibitor of
  Gi/Go proteins, stimulated with 90 M LA and then FAK activation and cell migration
  were assessed. Our results show that treatment of cells with PTX completely inhibited
  p-FAK and cell migration induced by LA.


  Ample studies have demonstrated that a dietary pattern characterized by high-fat
  choices, including saturated fatty acids, mono-unsaturated fatty acids, n-3 PUFA
  and n-6 PUFA, is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. Particularly,
  LA intake in the majority of the Western world is estimated to be 1520 g per day
  per person, with a plasma concentration of ~275 M. Moreover, LA has been linked
  to the development of cancer in animal models and to the induction of an EMT-like
  process in MCF10A cells. However, the contribution of LA to tumor progression through
  the regulation of cell migration in breast cancer cells has so far not been studied
  in detail.


  Cancer metastasis involves cell detachment, migration, invasion, extravasation and
  proliferation at distal sites. FAK is a signal molecule involved in tumorigenesis
  and metastasis regulating cell migration, survival, proliferation, spreading, invasion
  and angionesis. In the present study we show that LA induces FAK activation as well
  as cell migration through a FAK-dependent pathway in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells.
  In agreement with these findings, we previously showed that AA and oleic acid  induce
  FAK activation and cell migration of breast cancer cells, whereas LA induces growth
  and metastasis of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435 breast cancer cells in nude mice. Here,
  we hypothesize that LA induces FAK activation and cell migration by the activation
  of two GPCRs, i.e., FFAR1 and GPR120, because these receptors are expressed in MDA-MB-231
  breast cancer cells and are activated by medium and long chain FFAs, such as LA.
  This hypothesis still remains to be tested, but in support of our hypothesis, LA
  has been found to induce an increase in cellular Ca2+ concentration and proliferation
  via FFAR1 in breast cancer cells.


  Src family kinases play an important role in a variety of cellular functions including
  cell cycle progression, growth, survival and migration. Particularly, breast tumors
  and breast cancer cell lines exhibit an increase in Src kinase activity. Moreover,
  we showed that OA and AA induce Src family member activation and cell migration
  through a Src family member-dependent pathway in breast cancer cells. In line with
  this notion, we here demonstrate that LA induces FAK and Src activation, as well
  as cell migration, via Src family kinase activity in MDA-MB-231 cells.


  A model of reciprocal catalytic activation of FAK and Src has been proposed, where
  Src family kinases associated with FAK, phosphorylated at Tyr-397, phosphorylate
  FAK at additional tyrosine residues, including Tyr-576 and Tyr-577, with a maximal
  induction of FAK kinase activity. Maximal FAK kinase activity promotes intermolecular
  phosphorylation between FAK molecules at Tyr-397 leading to signal amplification.
  In line with this model, our current findings show that LA induces p-FAK and p-FAK-Tyr577,
  and that p-FAK is dependent on Src family kinase activity. These findings are in
  agreement with previous reports from our laboratory showing that OA and AA also
  induce p-FAK through a mechanism of reciprocal catalytic activation of FAK and Src
  family members. We here propose that FFAs mediate FAK activation through a mechanism
  of reciprocal catalytic activation of FAK and Src family members in breast cancer
  cells.


  AA is a PUFA and an essential fatty acid that is obtained through dietary sources,
  or is derived from LA. Free AA is enzymatically metabolized via three major pathways
  including LOXs, cyclooxygenases  and cytochrome P450  epoxygenases. The LOXs pathway
  produces several hydroeicosatetraenoic acids  that lead to the formation of leukotrienes,
  lipoxins  and hepoxillins. The COXs pathway is mediated by COX-1 and COX-2, which
  produce prostaglandins, prostacyclin D2, prostacyclin E2  prostacyclin PGF2, prostacyclin
  I2  and thromboxane A2. AA and its metabolites are involved in several biological
  processes including chemotaxis, inflammation, angiogenesis and apoptosis. Particularly,
  AA promotes adhesion to type IV collagen via 15--LOX activity in MDA-MB-435 cells,
  whereas AA induces FAK activation and cell migration through a LOXs-dependent pathway
  in MDA-MB-231 cells. Moreover, OA promotes FAK activation and cell migration through
  a PLC- and LOX-dependent pathway in MDA-MB-231 cells. Here, we show that FAK activation
  and cell migration induced by LA require LOXs and COX-2 activities in MDA-MB-231
  cells. These findings strongly suggest that eicosanoids produced by LOXs and COX-2
  mediate FAK activation and cell migration in MDA-MB-231 cells. In support of our
  results, it has been demonstrated by others that LA stimulates proliferation through
  a COX and LOX activity-dependent pathway in MDA-MB-231 cells.


  CYP450 enzymes constitute a superfamily of 57 isoenzymes that catalyze the metabolism
  of a large number of compounds including steroids, vitamins, fatty acids, PGs and
  LKs. Particularly, several CYP450 epoxygenases, including CYP450 2 W1 and CYP450
  4 F11, are highly expressed in breast cancer cells and metabolize AA to biologically
  active eicosanoids termed cis-epoxyeicosatrienoic acids. Since, our findings show
  that FAK activation and cell migration induced by LA are partly dependent on LOXs
  and COX-2 activity, we propose that CYP450 epoxygenasas may play a role in FAK activation
  and cell migration. This option, however, remains to be investigated.


  In mammalian cells, AA is esterified into phospholipids of the cell membranes, and
  it is the central eicosanoid precursor. The critical enzyme involved in AA release
  is the calcium-dependent cPLA2, but other enzymes have also been shown to be involved,
  including PLC and phospholipase D. Our results show that FAK activation induced
  by LA is independent on cPLA2 activity, whereas it requires PLC activity. These
  findings suggest that LA induces AA release through a PLC activity-dependent pathway.
  The role of PLD on FAK activation, however, still remains to be studied. Also, an
  alternative pathway has been described that releases AA from specific compartments
  including mitochondria, where the rate-limiting enzyme is ACSL4, which provides
  arachydonoyl-CoA to a mithochondrial acyl-CoA thioesterase that releases AA and
  directs this fatty acid to the LOXs for its oxidation to eicosanoids. In highly
  aggressive breast cancer cell lines, ACSL4 is over-expressed and appears to play
  a pivotal role in proliferation, invasion and migration. The role of this pathway
  on FAK activation and migration, induced by LA in MDA-MB-231 cells, remains to be
  studied.


  LOXs constitute a family of dioxygenases including 5-, 12-, and 15-LOX-1 and -2,
  and their main products are 5-, 12- and 15-HETE, respectively. Particularly, up-regulation
  of 12-LOX and exposition to 12--HETE have been shown to induce malignant growth
  and migration in colorectal cancer cells, whereas 15-LOX-1 has been shown to mediate
  the invasion of intra-metastatic lymphatic vessels and propagates lymph node metastasis
  of human mammary carcinoma xenografts in mice. Moreover, 12-HETE has been shown
  to induce the formation of focal adhesion plaques via a PTX sensitive pathway, leading
  to enhanced adhesion to fibronectin in murine B16 amelanotic cells. The action of
  12-HETE on target cells is mediated by the activation of GPCRs coupled to the heterotrimeric
  GTP-binding proteins Gi/Go. Our findings show that FAK activation and cell migration
  require LOXs activity and Gi/Go proteins. We propose that treatment of cells with
  LA induces the production of LOXs metabolites, such as 12-HETE which, subsequenty,
  induce the activation of GPCRs coupled with Gi/Go and signal transduction pathways
  that mediate FAK activation and cell migration in MDA-MB-231 cells.


  COX-1 is constitutively expressed in many tissues and cell types, and generates
  PGs that control normal physiological functions such as platelet aggregation. COX-2
  expression is induced by a variety of growth factors, pro-inflammatory stimuli,
  tumor promoters and mitogens, and is over-expressed in a variety of cancers including
  primary breast cancer and breast cancer cell lines. COX-2 mainly produces PGE2 and
  over-expression of COX-2 and PGE2 are associated with an unfavorable prognosis,
  whereas an elevated COX-2 expression correlates with distant metastasis in patients
  with breast cancer. E-type prostanoid receptors  are GPCRs that mediate the actions
  of PGE2. Particularly, EP3 modulates adenyl cyclase activity through Gi/Gs activation
  and through G-protein-Rho interactions. We demonstrate that FAK activation and cell
  migration induced by LA require COX-2 activity, and that treatment with PTX inhibits
  FAK activation and cell migration. We propose that LA induces COX-2 activation and
  the production of COX-2 metabolites, which induce EP3 activation and then FAK activation
  and cell migration. This notion, however, remains to be investigated.


  AA is synthesized from LA by a sequential series of enzymatic conversions. Specifically,
  LA is converted to -LA by the 6 desaturase, after which -LA is elongated to dihomo--LA
  by four enzymes, collectively referred to as elongase, after which dihomo--LA is
  converted to AA by the 5 desaturase. We show that FAK activation and cell migration
  induced by LA do not require 6 desaturase activity. Therefore, our findings strongly
  suggest that FAK activation and cell migration do not require the conversion of
  LA to AA. In support of our proposal, we demonstrated previously that LA induces
  an EMT-like process through a 6 desaturase-independent pathway in MCF10A cells.


  In conclusion, we propose that FFAs play an important role in the invasion of breast
  cancer cells via the induction of FAK activation and cell migration. In support
  of this proposal, it has been shown that increased expression of FAK correlates
  with increased invasion and migration of breast tumors, and that tumor cells over-expressing
  FAK show a tendency to invade surrounding tissues and to metastasize. In addition,
  we here show that LA induces a new signal transduction pathway, where FAK activation
  and cell migration induced by LA require Src, Gi/Go, COX-2 and LOXs activities in
  MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. We also show that cell migration requires FAK activity,
  whereas FAK activation requires Src activity, suggesting a reciprocal catalytic
  activation mechanism of FAK and Src. These findings, for the first time, indicate
  that LA may play an important role during the invasion process in breast cancer.
