  and have been proposed as therapeutic agents to counteract oxidative stress. However,
  under normal circumstances, the body only receives a very small amount of these
  substances in the diet. We have investigated the effect of extracts from known and
  frequently used plants as part of diet, food seasoning, medicinal tea, and sweetener
  at different concentrations on the ability to scavenge free radicals, to affect
  antioxidant enzymes, and finally in the survival of cancer cell lines. We found
  extract concentrations of about 100 μg.ml−1 more indicative in the assessment of
  all parameters investigated. Ginseng possessed a very good ability to scavenge superoxide
  and hydroxyl radicals, while stevia also manifested significant effects against
  hydroxyl radicals. Both extracts also showed NO decomposition ability. The antioxidant
  defense system against the excessive production of radicals in mitochondria was
  sufficient. In contrast, the range of operating concentrations for sage and oregano
  mainly presented no significant effects against reactive oxygen and nitrogen species.
  Taken together with the significantly reduced activity of glutathione peroxidase,
  this led to the depletion of glutathione. The demonstrated modulation of redox state
  capability was sufficient to affect the viability of all tested cancer cell lines,
  but especially A-549, CEM and HeLa by oregano extract. Results support the promising
  role of the tested extracts as a source of compounds for further in vivo studies
  with the ability to powerfully interfere with or modify the redox state of cells
  according to the type of disease, which is expected to be associated with oxidative
  stress.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEssential oils from aromatic and medicinal plants have been
  known to possess biological activity, such as antimicrobial and antioxidant properties,
  and efficacy in retarding the process of lipid oxidation. Oregano vulgare is an
  important aromatic plant widely used in many countries for seasoning foods. Oregano
  is used in folk medicine to treat respiratory disorders, dyspepsia, painful menstruation,
  rheumatoid arthritis, scrofula, and urinary tract disorders. Salvia officinalis,
  known as sage, comes from Europe. Apart from biological activities such as antioxidant
  properties, sage is known for its soothing and carminative effects. In addition,
  it has been reported that sage exhibits CNS acetylcholine receptor activity, with
  both nicotinic and muscarinic binding properties. Eleutherococcus senticosus Maxim.,
  native to the eastern areas of the Russian taiga and the northern regions of Korea,
  Japan, and China, is primarily known as an adaptogen. This term suggests that such
  a plant possesses four general properties: it is harmless to the host; it has a
  general, rather nonspecific effect; it increases the resistance of the recipient
  to a variety of physical, chemical, or biological stressors; and that it acts as
  a general stabilizer/normalizer for the user. Stevia rebaudiana is a plant of the
  Compositae family, native to Paraguay, Brazil, and Central America. It had been
  used for centuries as both a sweetener and a medicine. The leaf is many times sweeter
  than refined sugar but contains no carbohydrates or calories. There has been considerable
  interest in understanding the effects and mechanisms of the typical low-dose concentrations
  of phytochemicals as the relatively low amount of phytochemicals typically consumed
  is unlikely to achieve direct antioxidant concentrations in cells. Studies with
  experimental models of cancer, cardiovascular disease, and neurodegenerative disorders
  have provided evidence that at least some phytochemicals exert beneficial effects
  by activating adaptive stress response signaling pathways. The pathways typically
  involve the activation of kinases and transcription factors, resulting in the increased
  production of cytoprotective proteins including phase 2 enzymes, antioxidant enzymes,
  heat-shock proteins, growth factors, and proteins involved in the regulation of
  cellular energy metabolism. In response, cancer cells continually exposed to adverse
  conditions such as nutrient limitation, hypoxia, oxidative stress, and host defense
  may adapt to this selection pressure by acquiring robust and elaborate survival
  mechanisms. The emergence of vigorous cancer phenotypes is associated with comprehensive
  energetic and metabolic reprogramming. It is important to remember that reactive
  oxygen species may elicit cellular responses ranging from proliferation to cell
  death. Consequently, efforts in preventing cancer through use of antioxidants and
  anticancer treatment modalities based on pro-oxidant effects are equally well justified.\n\nThe
  production of ROS by mammalian mitochondria is important because it underlies oxidative
  damage in many pathologies and contributes to retrograde redox signaling from the
  organelle to the cytosol and nucleus. Although many purified mitochondrial proteins
  can be manipulated so as to produce, the physiological relevance of this is limited.
  Therefore, it is important to understand more about the production of O2 ·– within
  isolated mitochondria under conditions which mimic those that may arise in vivo
  under physiological or pathological conditions. One constraint of using isolated
  mitochondria is that the system is complicated and difficult to manipulate. The
  production of O2 ·– within the mitochondrial matrix, inter-membrane space, and outer
  membrane leads to the formation of hydrogen peroxide. Some O2 ·– can react directly
  with nitric oxide to form peroxynitrite. Since mitochondria are the major sites
  of free radical generation, they are highly enriched with antioxidants including
  GSH and enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase, which
  are present on both sides of their membranes in order to minimize oxidative stress
  in the organelle.\n\nThe aim of this study was to determine the ability of different
  concentrations of plant extracts from oregano, sage, ginseng, and stevia to scavenge
  four types of ROS: O2 ·–, NO·, ONO2 –, and hydroxyl radicals. Subsequently, we followed
  the activities of antioxidant enzymes and reduced glutathione levels on isolated
  mitochondria as respiratory-metabolic centers of cells but also as appropriate containment
  systems that can modulate their own production of ROS under these natural extracts.
  Then, we used the compounds in cancer cell line culture to determine whether a change
  in the redox conditions is sufficient to affect metabolic aberrations, affecting
  viability of cancer cells in vitro.\n\n\n\nAll chemicals used were of analytical
  grade. Solutions were freshly prepared using redistilled water. Dried root ethanolic
  extract from Siberian ginseng and extracts from leaves of stevia, essential oils
  from oregano, and sage were kindly purchased from Calendula ojsc.\n\nThe antioxidant
  properties of plant extracts against O2 ·– were evaluated by the method of Bauchamp
  and Fridovich. The reaction mixture contained 8.7 ml of 50 mmol l−1 phosphate-buffered
  solution with 0.1 mmol l−1 EDTA, 13 mmol l−1 L-methionine, and the tested extract
  at final concentrations of 5, 25, 50, 75, and 100 μg ml−1. Riboflavin and nitro-blue
  tetrazolium were added last. The resultant mixture was then exposed to UV light
  for 10 and 20 min. The absorbance of the solutions in the presence and the absence
  of the tested substance was determined at 450 and 560 nm before and after UV illumination.
  All measurements were taken in triplicate. The percentage inhibition of O2 ·– generation
  was evaluated by comparing the absorbance values of the control and experimental
  tubes and was calculated according to the following equation: =  × 100.\n\nOH was
  generated by the Fenton reaction system, and the scavenging capacity toward ·OH
  was measured by using the deoxyribose method. The reaction mixture contained 2-deoxy-D-ribose
  dissolved in 30 mmol l−1 PBS containing 40 mmol l−1 NaCl, 30 mmol l−1 ammonium iron(II)
  sulfate hexahydrate, 50 mmol l−1 H2O2, and plant extract sample at final concentrations
  of 5, 25, 50, 75, and 100 μg ml−1. The mixture was kept in a water bath at 37°C
  for 10 min. After incubation, a solution of 0.5 ml thiobarbituric acid reagent,
  TBA dissolved in 50 mmol l−1 NaOH followed by 0.5 ml 5.6% trichloroacetic acid was
  added to the reaction mixture. The mixture was then heated to 100°C for 8 min and
  then cooled down with water. The absorbance of the solution was measured spectrophotometrically
  at 532 nm. The ·OH scavenging capacity was evaluated with the inhibition percentage
  of 2-deoxyribose oxidation on hydroxyl radicals. The scavenging percentage was calculated
  according to the following formula: =  × 100/A 0, where A 0 is the absorbance of
  the control without a sample. A 1 is the absorbance after the addition of the sample
  and deoxyribose. A 2 is the absorbance of the sample without deoxyribose.\n\nNO
  was determined indirectly through the detection of its products, nitrites and nitrates.
  In aqueous phase, free of biological material, NO exclusively autooxidizes to nitrite,
  so that nitrite only determination was performed without need to reduce nitrates
  prior to the assay. One milliliter of the test substance was added to 2 ml of 10
  mmol l−1 sodium nitroprusside solution at different concentrations dissolved in
  PBS. The mixture was incubated for 150 min. at 25°C in the dark. Then, 1 ml of the
  mixture was mixed with 1 ml Greiss reagent ethylenediamine dihydrochloride). The
  absorbance of the chromophore formed was detected at a wavelength of 546 nm.\n\nONO2
  – was prepared according to Whiteman and Halliwell by mixing H2O2 and KNO2 in the
  ratio 1:1. Then two volumes of NaOH were added. The mixture was freeze-dried at
  −20°C overnight. A working solution of ONO2 - was obtained by diluting it in PBS.
  ONO2 – concentration was determined by spectrophotometry at 302 nm.\n\nMale Wistar
  rats weighing 200–250 g were used. The animals were sacrificed by cervical decapitation
  according to procedures approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee at Pavol Jozef
  Šafárik University in Košice. Liver mitochondria were isolated using the method
  of Fernández-Vizzara et al.. Mitochondrial protein yield was quantified using the
  bicinchoninic acid assay. The measurements were carried out in a respiratory medium,
  where the tested extracts were diluted to final concentrations of 125 and 62.5 μg
  ml−1. Enzyme activities in control samples were measured without the addition of
  extracts. The activity of glutathione reductase was measured according to a modified
  method described by Carlberg and Mannervik; that of glutathione peroxidase was measured
  as described by Flohe and Gunzler and that of superoxide dismutase by means of the
  SOD-Assay Kit-WST following the user manual provided, and calculated per milligram
  of mitochondrial proteins. Reduced glutathione content was measured by the modified
  method of Floreani et al. using Ellman’s reagent.\n\nThe following human cancer
  cell lines were used for this study: HeLa, CEM, MCF-7, A-549, MDA, and Caco 2. All
  cell lines used were kindly provided by Dr. Hajduch). HeLa and CEM cells were cultured
  in RPMI 1640 medium. MCF-7, A-549, MDA, and Caco 2 were cultured in growth medium
  consisting of high-glucose Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium. Both media were with
  Glutamax supplement with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin, and streptomycin in an
  atmosphere of 5% CO2 in humidified air at 37°C. Cell viability, estimated by trypan
  blue exclusion, was greater than 95% before each experiment.\n\nThe cytotoxic effects
  of tested extracts were studied by using colorimetric microculture assay with the
  MTT end point. The method is based on the conversion of the tetrazolium salt MTT
  in cells to insoluble formazan. Briefly, 8 × 103 cells were plated per well in 96-well
  polystyrene microplates in the culture medium containing the tested extracts at
  concentrations of 1,000–3.9 μg ml−1. After 72 h of incubation, 10 ml of MTT was
  added to each well. After an additional 4 h, during which insoluble formazan was
  produced, 100 ml of 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate was added to each well, and another
  12 h was allowed for the formazan to be dissolved. The absorbance was measured at
  540 nm with the use of the automated MRX microplate reader. The absorbance of the
  control wells was taken as 100%, and the results were expressed as a percentage
  of the control.\n\n\n\nThe ability to scavenge O2 ·– Fig. 1A was only 11% in the
  case of oregano essential oil at concentrations of 5, 75, and 100 μg ml−1 and remained
  almost unchanged. At 25 and 50 mg ml−1, however, the ability to uptake fell below
  5%. Sage demonstrated a very weak ability to scavenge O2 ·–. No ability was shown
  at the lowest concentration tested. The activity only reached 11% at concentrations
  of 50 μg ml−1. The ability to scavenge O2 ·– showed a slightly increasing tendency
  with increasing concentrations of ginseng, while the highest value reached around
  18% at a concentration of 75 μg ml−1. A further increase resulted in a decrease
  in O2 ·– scavenging activity. Stevia, like oregano, showed activity even at a concentration
  of 5 μg ml−1. This capability, however, was not affected by further increase in
  the stevia concentration, up to 50 μg ml−1. With further increases in concentration,
  however, activity declined.\n\n\nThe percentage of inhibition superoxide anion radical,
  nitric oxide, peroxynitrite, and hydroxyl radical by tested plant extracts.\n\nNitrite
  production from NO was higher than 25% with oregano essential oil at the lowest
  concentration used when compared to the control Fig. 1B . This declined to below
  2% as the concentrations increased. An even higher percentage of NO conversion was
  observed at the lowest concentration of sage. The activity of essential oil from
  sage plummeted below 5% even at a concentration of 50 μg ml−1, then increased slightly,
  but not exceeding 11% at 100 μg ml−1. Ginseng had the highest NO conversion ability,
  with a percentage of almost 54% even at the lowest concentration. The NO conversion
  capacity of ginseng did not decrease substantially as the concentration increased,
  and remained at 40%. Stevia extract also demonstrated a remarkable ability to convert
  NO. At concentrations of 25, 50, and 75 μg ml−1, it was as high as 42–45%. With
  further increase in concentration, the percentage conversion decreased only to 32.31%.\n\nONO2
  – concentration in solution only decreased with oregano extract at the lowest concentration
  used Fig. 1C . The concentration of ONO2 – rose with increasing extract concentration
  and therefore cannot be evaluated as the ability of inhibition Fig. 2. Sage extract
  was able to reduce the concentration of ONO2 – better at lower concentrations used,
  also with a declining trend from 9.37% to 8.56%. The concentrations of sage from
  75 to 100 μg ml−1 decreased the ability to convert ONO2 – from 6.94% to only 2.36%.
  Ginseng extract showed a very low ability to transform ONO2 – at concentrations
  of 25 and 50 μg ml−1 Fig. 1C . The concentration of ONO2 – in solutions of stevia
  had upward trend, which is also shown in Fig. 2.\n\n\nThe percentage increase in
  the concentration of peroxynitrite in treatment with extracts.\n\nIt was observed
  that the organic solvents normally used to prepare sample solutions may cause strong
  interference. In the deoxyribose degradation assay, any organic solvent should be
  completely evaporated before measurement, or the result will be meaningless. Therefore,
  measurements of hydroxyl radical scavenging ability of the extracts form oregano
  and sage were not provided. The extract from ginseng exhibited a hydroxyl radical
  scavenging ability of almost 20% at a concentration of 50 μg ml−1 Fig. 1E . When
  using higher concentrations, the value reached 30%. The activity of stevia is very
  interesting, with an increased scavenging capacity of 2.35%–9.8%–39.64% rising up
  to 67.04%, the highest measured, with increasing concentrations of extract.\n\nThe
  addition of the extracts caused no changes in mitochondrial SOD activity. Also,
  the activity of GPx under stevia treatment showed no changes in comparison to control.
  The activity of GPx was significantly decreased from −75.26% to −88.66% after incubation
  with oregano extract and increased in sage from −90.72% to −71.13%. Ginseng showed
  a rather opposite effect, where an increase in GPx activity was measured in comparison
  to control. A much higher increase in GPx activity was recorded at a higher concentration
  of ginseng. At a concentration of 62.5 μg ml−1, no significant effect was measured
  on GR activity. However, a significant reduction in GR activity was measured only
  at a higher concentration 125 μg ml−1 of oregano. The addition of oregano at a concentration
  of 125 μg ml−1 caused a significant decrease in reduced glutathione levels of 85.47%
  and, in the case of sage, of 57.52%. The lower oregano concentration used caused
  almost all GSH depletion. This was not the case with sage, where the measured decrease
  was only 34.65% when compared to the control.\n\n\nMitochondria antioxidant enzymes
  activities: superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase,
  and reduced glutathione content after treatment of tested plant extracts with final
  concentrations 125 and 62.5 μg ml−1  \n\n\n\nSurvival of different cancer cells
  exposed to 72 h incubation with the tested compounds and the IC50 values for each
  cell line are shown in Table 2. Oregano exhibited cytotoxicity against all cancer
  cell lines. There was a significant effect on the survival of cancer cell lines
  at concentrations of 125 and 62.5 μg ml−1, achieved by binary dilution. Oregano
  had a surprising and significant impact on the viability of A-549, MCF-7, CEM, and
  HeLa at a concentration of 125 μg ml−1. The final concentration of 125 μg ml−1 is
  also the lowest for sage in which we monitored the effect on survival of all cancer
  cell lines. Survival of A-549, CEM, and MCF-7 cell lines were significantly affected.
  Further reduction in sage concentration had no effect on the survival of MCF-7 and
  Caco2 and only a very weak effect on HeLa, MDA, and A-549. Our data indicate that
  extracts from ginseng and stevia showed very little to no cytotoxic effect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn
  this work, we aimed to determine the antioxidant properties of known and frequently
  used extracts as a whole, primarily for their extensive use in everyday life, as
  an integral part of human diet and in animal husbandry. The hypothesis of Mattson
  concluded that it is the antioxidant activity of phytochemicals that is responsible
  for their health benefits at micromolar concentrations. However, clinical trials
  and primary prevention studies of high doses of such antioxidants in humans have
  been disappointing at best. When testing the efficacy of growth inhibition in bacterial
  strains, antibiotics are active at concentrations of 10 μg ml−1 and plant extracts
  at concentrations of 100 μg ml−1, where they had a good potency level. To test the
  ability of extracts to scavenge free radicals, we have therefore chosen a concentration
  range from 5 to100 μg ml−1.\n\nThose radicals derived from oxygen represent the
  most important class of such species generated in living systems. Oregano showed
  a weak ability to scavenge O2 ·– and only at higher concentrations. Stevia demonstrated
  a better capacity at a lower concentration, while sage only showed this ability
  at a concentration of 50 μg ml−1. Otherwise, its ability to scavenge O2 ·– is very
  weak. In summary, from the results obtained, ginseng extract showed the best propensity
  to scavenge O2 ·– Fig. 1A .\n\nMitochondria generate approximately 2–3 nmol of O2
  ·– per milligram of protein; the ubiquitous presence of which indicates that it
  is the most important physiological source of this radical in living organisms.
  O2 ·– undergoes a dismutation reaction to H2O2 spontaneously and can be accelerated
  about four orders in the matrix by Mn-SOD, and in the inter-membrane space by Cu,
  Zn-SOD. After the addition of extracts prepared for the treatment with biological
  samples by binary dilution, we found no significant changes in the activity of SOD
  at all. Based on its fast catalytic activity, the latter may represent the prevalent
  scavenging pathway for O2 ·–. Because of a modest rate constant, the reaction between
  cytochrome c and O2 ·– would represent another O2 ·–-scavenging pathway in the inter-membrane
  space; however, the voltage-dependent anion channel allows the movement of O2 ·–
  from the inter-membrane space to the cytoplasmic surface of the outer membrane of
  mitochondria.\n\nH2O2 diffuses rapidly through membranes, and the release of H2O2
  from mitochondria to cytosol reflects the balance between H2O2 production and consumption
  reactions, with the latter mainly involving the reduction of H2O2 to H2O via GPx.
  GPx activity significantly decreased after the addition of oregano and sage at selected
  concentrations. The activity of GPx is affected by the presence of another antioxidant
  enzyme, GR, which continuously recycles the oxidized glutathione to the reduced
  state. However, GR activity was only significantly reduced at the highest concentration
  of oregano. GSH levels were significantly reduced. In the case of oregano, it was
  also possible to consider the total depletion. Unlike O2 .-, H2O2 is more stable
  and is able to oxidize key thiol residues on proteins and low-mecular-weight thiolating
  agents such as GSH. The addition of stevia showed no changes in the activities of
  GPx and GR, although the levels of GSH pointed to significant changes. GSH levels
  were several times higher than that in controls, and there was an observed decrease
  as the treatment concentration decreased. The effect of ginseng at both concentrations
  caused a significant increase in the activity of GPx, though glutathione levels
  were significantly raised compared to control, without changes in the activity of
  GR. These findings seem interesting, because mitochondria do not synthesize GSH
  but rather transport and accumulate up to approximately 15% of the total cellular
  GSH. The chemical composition of the biological environment is of foremost importance,
  including the concentration of NO, or reactive nitrogen oxide species derived from
  NO, and cellular targets. Under conditions of excess NO, nitrosative modifications
  of biomolecules can occur either through oxidation by NO2 followed by nitrosylation
  with excess NO or via N2O3 formation. The concentration of NO decomposition products,
  e.g., oxidative end-product nitrite and nitrate, is reported to be a reasonable
  approximation of NO levels. Oregano and sage extracts alone showed only a weak ability
  to increase the concentration of nitrites, but stevia and especially ginseng reached
  more than 40% efficiency at concentrations in the range of 50–100 μg ml−1. Under
  conditions of excess nitrite, it has been suggested that heme proteins mediate substrate
  nitrosation through catalytic production of N2O3. This mechanism may be responsible
  for nitrosation of low-molecular-weight thiols and amines. It should be noted that
  many of the enzyme motifs such as amines, thiols, and zinc fingers are not inhibited
  by trans-nitrosation. Thus, modification of molecular motifs during nitrosative
  stress may occur only under conditions of excess NO and through the intermediacy
  of RNOS. This could also lead to an explanation of the significant differences in
  measured levels of GSH under the treatment of mitochondria with different extracts.\n\nO2
  ·– generated toward the inter-membrane space may play an important role in nitration
  through ONO2 – formation when NO is present. ONO2 – can oxidize thiols to either
  thyil radicals or to sulfenic acids, leading to protein glutathionylation. The ability
  of ginseng and sage to scavenge ONO2 – was very low. The presence of oregano or
  stevia to the contrary led to an increase in ONO2 – concentration. It is important
  to note that the reaction of NO with ONO2 – forms N2O3, which may result in nitrosative
  stress. While NO does not interact directly with thiols, N2O3, formed by autooxidation
  or from acidified nitrite, has a high affinity for thiol-containing peptides and
  may cause the observed depletion of GSH.\n\nThe most chemically active species primarily
  associated with mitochondria, microsomes, and peroxisomes are generated by the Fenton
  reaction from H2O2 or by the decomposition of ONO2 – itself. Due to the nature of
  extracts of oregano and sage, it was not possible to measure the uptake ability
  of ·OH by these extracts. The ability of ginseng was very good, around 30% and,
  surprisingly, stevia expressed the best activity toward this highly reactive radical.
  GPx catalyzes the conversion of hydrogen peroxide or peroxide to water or the corresponding
  alcohols indirectly. As both extracts increased GPx activity, thereby suggesting
  a lower probability of radical formation, we could express the assumption that there
  were no oxidative or nitrosative stress conditions in mitochondria treated with
  these two extracts.\n\nSince mitochondrial ROS production is modulated in a variety
  of nontransformed cells, it may also affect cancer cells in which ROS levels are
  characteristically high. We have found that the viability of all cancer cell lines
  is affected at concentrations above and below 100 μg ml−1 using extracts from oregano
  and, to a lesser extent, sage. Based on our previous findings about the activities
  of antioxidant enzymes in mitochondria and properties of extracts against reactive
  species, we can yet consider several options that would result in a reduction of
  cancer cell survival under oregano and sage treatment being described in the range
  of effective concentrations. All of them could lead to GSH depletion and affect
  the mitochondrial redox state. Firstly, through possible oxidation by excess peroxides
  due to lack of GPx activity. Chemical depletion of GSH significantly enhanced the
  cytotoxicity of NO or NO donors. Secondly, it may act through a nitrosative or oxidative
  mechanism. Nitrosative stress can modulate the dual pathways that lead to pro- and
  anti-apoptosis, depending on the redox state and transition metal complexes within
  the cells. Thirdly, we found very little activity in these extracts in NO decomposition
  and potentiation rather than quenching of ONO2 –. This therefore increases the likelihood
  of such cyclical ·OH or N2O3 formation, which further suggests conditions of significant
  RNOS formation.\n\nIn summary, the results obtained indicate that the selected extracts
  achieve a good potency level at about 100 μg ml−1 but with a different overall effect.
  While ginseng and stevia exhibit antioxidant properties with increasing concentrations,
  oregano and sage tend to change the redox state. This might be helpful in preventing
  or slowing the progress of various oxidative stress-related diseases. It is first
  necessary to verify their effect on in vivo studies, because the effective dose
  could still be achievable despite the undeniably strong taste, which under natural
  conditions, is a natural barrier to increased intake.\n\n\n\nThe study was financially
