  Death of MDA-MB-231 Bre.md

  We have previously demonstrated that incubating breast cancer cells with docosahexanoic
  acid  prior to treatment with doxorubicin  increased  the action of the drug. The
  objective of the current study was to expolore how pre-treating MDA-MB-231 cells
  with DHA prior to Dox treatment alter gene expression. Cells were treated with control
  medium  or DHA  in control media for 48 hrs and then treated for 24 hrs with Dox.
  RNA was extracted for microarray analysis. A selection criterion of fold change  1.5  was
  used to define up or down regulated genes in the Dox treated cells, compared to
  cells in control media. DHA + Dox treated cells had more genes up or down regulated  than
  Control + Dox treated cells. Two canonical pathways found to have multiple genes
  up or down regulated by DHA + Dox were cell cycle and cell death. More specifically
  key genes involved in cell cycle were down regulated with DHA \+ Dox treated cells,
  but not Control + Dox included Cyclin B1, WEE  and CDC25C. In the apoptosis pathway,
  DHA +Dox treated cells had up regulated CD95  and Caspase 10  and down regulated
  BCL2. Changes in expression of these key genes were confirmed by protein quantification
  using western blot analysis. Our results suggest that treating MDA-MB-231 cells
  with DHA may be improving the cytotoxic effects of Dox through several cellular
  pahtways. Funding from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and the Alberta
