  The research studied the impact of smoke generation sources on PAH contamination
  in four different smoke-cured fish. The smoke sources used included acacia, sugarcane
  bagasse and mangrove. PAHs in the smoke-cured fish were analysed using Varian GC/MS
  system. The mean total PAH concentrations in the smoked fish ranged from 250.59-1376.09
  Î¼g/kg in tuna, cigar minnows, sardine and mackerel smoke-cured with sugarcane bagasse,
  mangrove and acacia for between 2 and 8 h. The mean BaP levels for most fish cured
  with smoke from acacia and mangrove for between 2 and 8 h were all above the European
  Commission set limit of 5.0 Î¼g/kg. Positive correlations were observed between
  PAH levels in smoked fish and lignin contents of wood type used for the smoke generation,
  the fat content and the smoke-curing duration. Risk assessment conducted using benzopyrene
  carcinogenic and mutagenic toxicity equivalency factors showed high risk associated
  with consuming fish smoke-cured with hard woods. Sugarcane bagasse was found to
  be relatively the best and safest smoke-generating source for smoke-curing of fish
  among the three wood types when using the traditional kiln.'
