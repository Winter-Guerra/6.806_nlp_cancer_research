  Antiviral and Antifungal Properties of Wines and Winery Byproducts in Relation to
  Their Flavonoid Content.md
text: "\n\nGrapes produce organic compounds that may be involved in the defense of
  the plants against invading phytopathogens. These metabolites include numerous phenolic
  compounds that are also active against human pathogens. Grapes are used to produce
  a variety of wines, grape juices, and raisins. Grape pomace, seeds, and skins, the
  remains of the grapes that are a byproduct of winemaking, also contain numerous
  bioactive compounds that differ from those found in grapes and wines. This overview
  surveys and interprets our present knowledge of the activities of wines and winery
  byproducts and some of their bioactive components against foodborne, medical, and
  oral pathogenic bacteria, viruses, fungi, parasites, and microbial toxins  in culture,
  in vivo, and in/on food  in relation to composition and sensory properties. Also
  covered are antimicrobial wine marinades, antioxidative and immunostimulating aspects,
  and adverse effects associated with wine consumption. The collated information and
  suggested research needs might facilitate and guide further studies needed to optimize
  the use of wines and byproducts to help improve microbial food safety and prevent
  or treat animal and human infections.\n\nadverse effects; antibacterial; antibiotic

  crop in the world after oranges. According to the Food and Agricultural Organization
  of the United Nations, &gt;67 million tons of grapes is produced annually worldwide,
  with the United States contributing about 10% to the total. Wines are classified
  into major groups, table wines with an alcohol content ;14% and dessert wines produced
  from grapes high in sugar and low in acid content. During the production of wines,
  up to 40% of the grapes ends up as byproducts. Winery byproducts including grape
  pomace, seeds, skins, stems, and leaves are rich sources of inexpensive antioxidative
  phenolic compounds. Numerous studies have demonstrated that these compounds exhibit
  health-promoting effects associated with cardioprotective, neuroprotective, and
  other health benefits. The present paper seems to be the first review on the antimicrobial
  properties of wines and winery byproducts.\n\nThe literature indicates that the
  concentrations of the byproducts vary widely among the different grape cultivars
  from which they are derived. Because biological activities and health benefits may
  depend on both the total amounts and the specific amounts of highly bioactive phenolic
  compounds present in the byproducts, there is a need to relate the beneficial effects
  to the composition of the wines and byproducts.\n\nFood safety researchers, regulatory
  agencies, microbiologists, virologists, epidemiologists, nutritionists, pharmacists,
  physicians, and the general public have been increasingly concerned about the growing
  number of foodborne illnesses caused by some pathogens. Antibiotic resistance of
  some pathogens associated with foodborne illness caused by the overconsumption of
  medicinal antibiotics seems to exacerbate these effects. There has been increasing
  interest in developing novel plant-derived safe antimicrobial compounds, including
  those present in grapes and grape products.\n\nThe main objective of this review
  is to unify and interpret widely scattered information on reported studies on the
  inhibitory effects of bioactive grape-derived polyphenolic compounds against pathogenic
  bacteria, viruses, and fungi in vitro and in/on food. The cited findings and suggested
  research outlined below may facilitate and guide further needed studies to optimize
  the use of wines and grape-derived products to improve microbial food safety and
  to protect animals and humans against infectious diseases.\n\nIn general, the phenolic
  composition of grapes may be influenced by variety, vineyard, micro- and macroclimate,
  viticultural practice, and winemaking techniques. To help provide a scientific rationale
  for the antibiotic properties, we will first provide brief summaries on the composition,
  sensory properties, and immunostimulating, antioxidative, and adverse aspects of
  wines.\n\nThe extraordinarily large number of structurally different wine flavonoids
  is illustrated in randomly selected recent studies. Two review papers on structures
  of wine flavonoids by He et al. list 25 free anthocyanin glycosides, 25 anthocyanin
  diglycosides, and 63 anthocyanin-derived pigments, along with molecular and fragment
  ion mass spectral peaks and UVvis absorption maxima for most of these compounds.
  Selected compositional aspects described below further demonstrate the presence
  of different classes and amounts of polyphenolic compounds in wines originally synthesized
  in grapes and numerous new ones formed during winemaking.\n\nNew Zealand Pinot noir
  and Pinot Meunier wines contain the following polyphenol compounds:  anthocyaninscyanidin-3-glucoside,
  delphinidin-3-glcoside, malvidin-3-glucoside, peonidin-3-glucoside, petunidin-3-glucoside,
  and vitisin, with total depending on extraction solvent and ranging from 6.01 to
  17.35 malvidin equivalents/g extracts;  flavanolscatechin, epicatechin, epicatechin
  gallate, procyanidin A, and procyanidin B;  flavonolsquercetin and quercetin methyl-glucoside;
  and  a nonflavonoidgallic acid. The procyanidin content of polymeric phenolic isolates
  from Pinot noir wine during fermentation varied from 27 to 54%.\n\nThe analysis
  of wines by HPLC and LC-DAD/ESI-MS revealed the presence of the following classes
  of bioactive compounds in wines:  phenolic acidscaffeic, gallic, protocatechuic,
  4-hydroxybenzoic, and syringic;  flavonoids-catechin, catechin dimer, -epicatechin,
  epicatechin gallate trimer, procyanidin B1, procyanidin B2, quercetin-3-O-rhamnoside,
  trans-polydatin, and trans-resveratrol; and  total phenolic content of 327.6 gallic
  acid equivalents /g extract. A related study reported a TPC of 628 mg GAE/g in grape
  seed extracts originating from Turkish grapes.\n\nAn Australian study found that
  the proximity of eucalyptus trees to grapevines can directly influence the concentration
  of the aroma compound 1,8-cineole present in the corresponding red wines, and a
  fermentation study showed that the amount of rotundone in red wine can be influenced
  by grapevine leaves and stems in the ferment.\n\nStatistical instruments based on
  artificial neural networks  can be used to predict relationships between the total
  phenolic, flavonoid, anthocyanin, and tannin levels and antioxidative activity and
  wine variety and authenticity.\n\nUsing wine model solutions, Sousa et al. demonstrated
  interactions between deoxyanthocyanidin, catechinpyrilium compounds formed in red
  wines aged in oak barrels, and copigment molecules that form new wine ingredients.
  Related studies reported that  postharvest treatment of grapes with ethylene before
  vinification affected wine composition and  exposure of grapevine cv. Tempranillo
  fruit-bearing cuttings to UV-B radiation induced changes in the profiles of flavonoids
  and amino acids.\n\nAbout 20% of the grape remains as pomacepeel, seeds, and stemsafter
  wine production. Pomaces that are largely used as soil conditioners or as fertilizers
  contain significant quantities of phenolic compounds that are not extracted into
  the wines. A high-phenolic grape pomace residue that consists of skin and seeds
  after the winemaking fermentation process can be analyzed. Several chemical and
  biological methods have been used to determine antioxidant and antimicrobial properties
  of grape seed and skin extracts, including quantitative analysis of phytochemicals
  by HPLC and GC-MS, measuring antioxidant activities, determining total antioxidant
  capacity, and measuring antimicrobial activity using the agar well diffusion method.\n\nThe
  described approaches could serve as a model for the in vitro evaluation of grape
  products. The review by Fontana et al. on grape pomace lists 25 reported solidliquid
  extraction and 28 HPLC detection methods for the characterization of different classes
  of phenolic compounds in the extracts. The authors suggest that future studies should
  focus on simplified extraction methods and nontoxic solvents that meet generally
  accepted as safe  requirements. The distribution of p-coumaric, ellagic, gallic,
  protocatechuic, syringic, and vanillic acids, -epicatechin, myricetin, kaemferol,
  and quercetin of grape pomace extracts  from a mixture of Chilean grapes depended
  on the nature of the solvent used for the extraction.\n\nThe pomace contains the
  following antioxidative polyphenolic categories: phenolic acids, flavonoids, lignans,
  and stilbenes. The Brazilian investigators report that GPE also contains chlorogenic
  acid, trans-resveratrol, and rutin and that the total phenolic content  of seeds
  /g is greater than that in the skins.\n\nAnother detailed LC-MS study of 14 pomace
  samples originating from red wines showed  the presence of 13 anthocyanins, 12 phenolic
  acids, and 15 anthoxanthins and stilbenes;  the total anthocyanin content of peel
  separated from five grape pomaces from two vintages ranged from 2744 to 131,868
  mg/kg DM, or a 48-fold variation from lowest to highest value, with malvidin-3-O-glucoside
  being the predominant anthocyanin followed by peonidin-3-O-glucoside;  the content
  of phenolic acids was much lower than that of anthocyanins and varied significantly
  among samples of different vintages, with caftaric acid being the predominant compound
  in all samples;  with the exception of the 3-flavan-3-ols in the seeds that ranged
  up to several grams per kilogram of dry matter, anthoxanthins and stilbenes were
  minor components; and  aside from lack of anthocyanins,there were no major differences
  in total, but there were differences among individual phenolic compounds among pomaces
  from red and white grapes. The TPC of pomace extracts from five Turkish grape cultivars
  ranged from 6.63 to 20.1 mg/g. Levels of 19 individual phenolic compounds in the
  extracts ranged from 0.0031 mg/g for trans- resveratrol to 50.83 mg/g for -catechin.\n\nAn
  evaluation of Moroccan Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and Syrah red wine fractions
  against four Gram-positive bacteria, nine Gram-negative bacteria, two yeasts, and
  four molds showed that the Cabernet Sauvignon wine, as well as fractions with the
  highest monomeric anthocyanin content, were the most active, suggesting that these
  compounds largely contribute to the antimicrobial effects associated with wine components.\n\nThe
  high phenolic content of grape pomace is due to the fact that some of these bioactive
  compounds are poorly extracted into the wine during the vinification process. Environmental
  factors, such as climate and soil, and grape variety also influence the composition
  of the pomaces.\n\nThese results indicate that studies on bioactivities of grape
  pomace, skins, and seeds need to take into account compositional differences among
  the test substances. For example, juicemaking pomace from Cabernet Sauvignon wine
  is a better source of anthocyanins for use in functional foods than winemaking pomace.\n\nGrape
  seed extracts derived from whole grape seeds are a rich source of bioactive flavonoids
  such as resveratrol, oligomeric procyanidins, and linoleic acid. Microencapsulation
  has the potential to reduce the astringency and bitterness of grape seed extracts
  for use as a functional food. An HPLC analysis of fatfree grape seeds extracted
  with acetone/water/acetic acid  showed the following contribution of nine procyanidins
  to the total : monomers, 48; dimers, 16.5; trimers, 10.8; tetramers, 8.1; pentamers,
  5.3; hexamers, 3.2; heptamers, 2.7; octamers, 3.0; and nonamers, 1.5.\n\nAnalysis
  by HPLC and LC-DAD/ESI-MS revealed the presence of the following classes of bioactive
  compounds in the seeds from pomace:  phenolic acidscaffeic, gallic, protocatechuic,
  4-hydroxybenzoic, and syringic;  flavonoids-catechin, catechin dimer, -epicatechin,
  epicatechin gallate trimer, procyanidin B1, procyanidin B2, quercetin-3-O-rhamnoside,
  trans-polydatin, and trans-resveratrol; and  total phenolic content of 327.6 gallic
  acid equivalents /g extract. A related study reported a total phenolic content of
  628 mg GAE/g in grape seed extracts originating from Turkey.\n\nAnalysis of grape
  seeds and pomaces derived from six French grape varieties showed that the highest
  total phenolic content of 44.5 GAE/g dry wt was present in Alicante seeds compared
  with 31.6 GAE/g dry wt for pomace. Additional studies showed pomaces also contained
  significant amounts of proanthocyanidins and anthocyanin glycosides and that seeds
  had the highest antioxidant capacity. Related studies found that  the percentage
  of prodelphinidins in the seed and skin extracts of two Croatian grape cultivars
  was negatively correlated with the bitterness  intensity of the skins and  a grape
  seed proanthocyanidin extract improved the psychological and physical symptoms and
  reduced blood pressure in middle-aged menopausal women.\n\nThe following selected
  results indicate that grape stems and leaves are additional sources of bioactive
  phenolic compounds. Pssa et al. reported that grapevine Vitis vinifera stems contained
  trans-resveratrol and derivatives, flavan-3-ols, and phenolic acid glucosides. A
  factorial design and response surface method used to assess the extractability of
  phenolic compounds from the stems of three grape varieties followed by GC-MS analysis
  showed the presence of the following compounds: caffeic acid, flavanols, and derivatives,
  dehydroflavanols, and flavonols. An evaluation of byproducts from 10 different grape
  varieties showed that stems from Callet, Syrah, Premsal Blanc, Parellada, and Mano
  Negro varieties contained the highest total phenolic and total proanthocyanidin
  content and showed the greatest antioxidant capacity; that Chardonnay and Merlot
  stems showed the lowest values; that no significant differences were apparent among
  stems from red or white varieties; and that the stems from the Callet variety are
  an especially rich source of polyphenols. Results from a study on copigmentation
  effects of pomace, skins, seeds, and stem extracts suggest the possibility of reusing
  the byproducts to improve the biological value and color properties of red wines.
  Grape stem extracts inhibited the growth of breast, colon, renal, and thyroid cancer
  cells, suggesting that stem phenolics might also inhibit microbial cells.\n\nGrapevine
  V. vinifera leaves contained flavonols, flavones, and stilbenes. Flavonols slow
  the infection of grapevine leaves by Plasmopara viticola phytopathogens. The total
  phenolic content of leaves from organically and conventionally grown Vitis labrusca
  plants was similar, but the organic leaves contained 10 times more resveratrol than
  did the conventional leaves. Whether grapevine leaves can serve as an inexpensive
  source of bioactive phenolic compounds merits study.\n\nBecause sensory properties
  of wines affect consumption and bioactivity, we present here summaries of selected
  studies on the relationship between composition and sensory properties such as astringency,
  bitterness, bouquet, color, flavor, and taste.\n\nAn investigation of the sensory,
  olfactory, and hedonic properties of Italian wines showed that Italian students
  liked about equally wines prepared from grapes grown organically and conventionally
  and that 61% of respondents were willing to pay more for organically produced wines.
  A study designed to define the relationship between phenolic composition and color
  of wines produced by 55 different grape samples found that the average ratios between
  wine and grape phenolics ranged from 0.25 and 7.9 for the different phenolic compounds,
  that individual wine phenolics correlated with several wine phenolics, and that
  there was a high correlation between predicted and measured total wine color, suggesting
  that it is possible to predict the color and quality of fresh wines from grape measurements.
  Ethyl phenylacetate, phenylacetic acid, and -decalactone were found to be key aroma
  compounds in sour rotten wines at levels above those found in controls, suggesting
  that rot infection affects sensory properties of Portuguese wines. Measurements
  of the phenolic composition of grapes and wines from two maturity stages and two
  maturation times showed that  grape anthocyanin increased during ripening,  procyanidin
  content of wine decreased with extraction and maceration time,  wine made from riper
  grapes contained higher tannin levels, and  the color of the French wines was related
  to the content of anthocyanins and anthocyanintannin adducts, suggesting that sensory
  quality is linked to grape quality at harvest. Storage of sweet red wines in the
  bottle for a year caused degradation of monomeric anthocyanins, with most of them
  being lost between 6 and 9 months, the appearance of stable oligomeric and polymeric
  pyranoanthocyanin and methylmethine-mediated condensation products, hydrolysis of
  glycosylated flavonols to aglycones, and retention of antioxidative and sensory
  properties. By contrast, increasing storage temperature seems to reduce the antioxidative
  properties of California wines, especially Cabernet Sauvignon and other Chardonnay
  varieties. Analysis of 67 red French wines showed that 3-methyl-2,4-nonadione is
  a good marker for defining quantitative changes in the oxidative potential.\n\nRelated
  recent studies on the relationship between composition and sensory properties include
  \ analytical characterization of red wines by aroma wheels;  apparent relationships
  between starter cultures, sensory and chemical attributes, and consumer acceptance
  of South African wines;  changes in composition and organoleptic properties of wines
  stored in wooden barrels;  the sensory quality of Cabernet wines related to grape
  quality at harvest and to anthocyanin, proanthocyanidins, and grape volatiles; and
  \ the greater impact of large-sized, water-soluble tannins on wine astringency and
  bitterness of Cabernet Sauvignon wines relative to smaller-sized hydrophobic, highly
  pigmented tannins. Additional studies on sensory aspects include those by Vidal
  et al., Malherbe et al., Bindon et al., Schmidtke et al., Villamor and Ross, and
  Ugliano.\n\nThe cited studies suggest that grape composition, winemaking practices,
  and storage conditions significantly affect sensory and presumably health-promoting
  properties of wines. It is not known to what extent, if any, these complex relationships
  might also affect antimicrobial properties.\n\nHere, we will briefly highlight some
  of the biomarkers that have been reported to be related to the beneficial effects
  of wine compounds at the molecular and cellular levels that might be related to
  bioactivities of wines and wine compounds.\n\nItalian red wine induced the release
  of nitric oxide and both anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory cytokines in healthy
  human blood mononuclear cells, leading to the maintenance of the immune host; removal
  of the polyphenols from red wine abrogated these effects. Exposure of macrophages
  stimulated by bacterial lipopolysaccharide to malvidin, the most abundant polyphenolic
  compound in red wine, induced a series of cellular and signaling events that protect
  cells against inflammation-mediated chronic diseases, suggesting that malvidin significantly
  contributes to the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of red wine. A human
  study with 67 high cardiovascular risk male volunteers found that the phenolic content
  of red wines may modulate leukocyte adhesion molecules and that ethanol polyphenols
  of red wine may modulate soluble inflammatory mediators in high-risk patients, suggesting
  that both ethanol and nonalcoholic compounds contribute to the anti-inflammatory
  effects. On the basis of a review of the literature on the anti-inflammatory properties
  of flavonoids from different sources in humans, Peluso et al. suggest the need for
  placebo-controlled trials to identify bioactive flavonoids in the anti-inflammatory
  effect of plant foods, including wines.\n\nOn the basis of the mechanism that seems
  to govern the anti-inflammatory action of a red wine extract, Nunes et al. suggest
  that the wine extract may represent a simple and inexpensive therapeutic strategy
  against intestinal inflammation. This suggestion is supported by the observation
  that a grape seed extract enhances the chemotherapy of colon cancer in rats by the
  drug 5-fluorouracil by decreasing the severity of inflammation-related mucositis
  of the cancer cells. Because macrophage cells associated with the immune system
  seem to have a strong affinity for pathogenic bacteria, and natural compounds protected
  mice against lethal effects of Salmonella via immunostimulation, expectations are
  that wine flavonoids might exhibit similar in vivo antibiotic effects.\n\nAs illustrated
  by the following selected recent studies, the antioxidative properties of wine compounds
  seem to be paramount in neutralizing adverse effects of reactive oxygen species
  \ that induce oxidative stress in tissues that contributes to the cause of chronic
  diseases. Free radicals are highly reactive, short-lived molecules that can react
  with and damage essential structural proteins, enzymes, and DNA. Such damage has
  the potential to cause cancer, atherosclerosis, and cardiovascular and other diseases.
  Wine flavonoids have the potential to reduce such undesirable molecular events because
  the high-energy, highly reactive free electron on DNA is transformed to a less reactive
  and thus less damaging radical. Wine antioxidants inhibit the activation of the
  oxidative stress-related transcription nuclear factor B  that participates in the
  regulation of inflammatory responses.\n\nA study of the effect of acute and chronic
  consumption by 19 obese men of red wine or dealcoholized red wine showed that consumption
  of moderate, but not high, amounts of red wine acutely increased plasma total antioxidant
  capacity  and suppressed NF-B activation, whereas chronic red wine, but not dealcoholized
  red wine, consumption increased oxidative lipid damage. Romanian scientists found
  that mathematical modeling of red wines from different grape varieties showed that
  57% of the observed variance in antioxidant capacity is linearly related to the
  age of the wines and that neural networks can be used to predict antioxidant activities
  and classification of wines. A Canadian study found that red wine intake by 12 healthy
  human volunteers induced a marked increase in salivary radical-scavenging activity
  within 30 min followed by a plateau up to 240 min, suggesting that the wine greatly
  improved the salivary antioxidant status. An Australian study found that warmer
  climate wines had lower in vitro antioxidant capacity values but retained good ex
  vivo bioavailability compared to cool climate wines, suggesting the need for further
  studies of the effect of soil composition on the polyphenolic content. A Slovakian
  in vitro interaction study of three red wine polyphenols and their mixtures found
  that the antioxidant activity of individual polyphenols is not a constant value
  in the presence of other polyphenols, suggesting that the antioxidant quality of
  individual polyphenols differs markedly when tested separately and in mixtures,
  presumably because interactions can cause additive, antagonistic, and synergistic
  effects. The authors suggest the need for in vivo studies, where interactions among
  compounds always take place in a mixture. It is also worth noting that wine antioxidative
  properties seem to be influenced differently by each polyphenolic compound and that
  the antioxidant potential of GSEs is 20- and 50-fold greater than those of vitamins
  C and E. We do not know whether antioxidative properties of wine flavonoids correlate
  with antibiotic effects.\n\nTo balance the largely beneficial properties of wines,
  here, we briefly mention some possible adverse effects of wine components.\n\nModerate
  consumption  of red wines with an alcohol content of 1213% has been associated with
  numerous health benefits mentioned earlier. Both alcohol and polyphenolic compounds
  of wine seem to contribute to these beneficial effects. To what extent, if any,
  excess consumption of wine might adversely affect human health merits study.\n\nWine
  contains a class of compounds called biogenic amines naturally present in grapes
  and/or produced by amino acid transaminase induced transamination of aldehydes by
  decarboxylation of amino acids by microbial enzymes. Because the biogenic amines
  are reported to cause various symptoms in susceptible humans associated with allergic
  reaction, there is an interest in their content in different wine varieties. For
  example, the analysis of 67 Italian wines showed that red wines contained 19.3 mg/L
  total biogenic amines, rose wines, 9.2 mg/L, and white wines, 7.67 mg/L, with histamine,
  tyramine, and cadaverine as the most representative amines.\n\nBioactive compounds
  from wines and other foods can occasionally inhibit cytosolic sulfotransferases
  \ that catalyze the sulfonation  of catecholamines, resulting in increased plasma
  levels of these bioactive compounds that can trigger migraine headache, increased
  blood pressure, and atrial fibrillation.\n\nLow levels of d-amino acids  are produced
  by Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Oenococcus oeni during fermentation of wine. Another
  study found that the concentrations of d-amino amino acids relative to the corresponding
  l-enantiomers ranged for white wines from 0.4 to 3.9% d-Ala, from 0.9 to 8.3% d-Asx,
  and from 0.5 to 8.9% d-Glx; in red wines, from 2.9 to 10.6% d-Ala, from 2.2 to 10.9%
  d-Asx, and from 3.9 to 7.4% d-Glx. Storage times of bottled wines up to 24 years
  did not correlate with d-amino acid content. Studies on the nutrition and safety
  of d-amino acids reported that d-Lys is not bioavailable as a source of l-Lys and
  that certain d-amino amino acids inhibited the growth of mice.\n\nAnalysis of 32
  different wines showed that the average homocysteine content, an amino acid that
  is linked to cardiovascular disease and to macular edema and neuropathy in patients
  with type 2 diabetes, was 10.31 and 6.11 M and in red and white wines, respectively.\n\nThe
  possible human carcinogen ochratoxin A produced by Aspergillus and Penicillium fungal
  species was found to be present in about 50% of all evaluated wines at levels that
  are generally lower than the European Union  regulatory level of 2 g/L.\n\nSulfites
  added to wines as antimicrobial preservatives to extend shelf life may aggravate
  symptoms of allergic asthma. Wine labels suggest that susceptible individuals need
  to be aware of the possible adverse effects of wines.\n\nWith the above brief overview
  of wine composition, sensory properties, bioactivities, and possible adverse effects
  as background, reported studies on the antimicrobial, antiviral, and antifungal
  potential of wines and wine byproducts, in culture, in vivo, and on/in food will
  now be described.\n\nThis section presents brief overviews of reported studies on
  the growth inhibition of bacteria that can cause human illness. The individual pathogens
  are listed alphabetically followed by studies that cover multiple pathogens. General
  comments concerning pathogenicity are based on information listed in a book on foodborne
  pathogens and in The Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy.\n\nThis foodborne pathogen
  causes vomiting and diarrhea. A study on wine-induced inactivation of B. cereus
  found that  wine inactivated B. cereus cultures to undetectable levels in &lt;10
  s,  wine diluted with water was less effective,  B. cereus spores were highly resistant
  to inactivation,  wine organic acids strongly inhibited vegetative cells,  wine
  phenolic compounds were inactive, and  the addition of wine to a simulated intestine
  resulted in a reduction of the total number of vegetative cells and spores. It can
  be suggested that these results show that drinking wine with a meal or consumption
  as a marinade might reduce the viable B. cereus organisms, thus lowering the toxic
  potential of this pathogen. A related study reported that tea catechins and theaflavins
  and whole teas exhibited exceptionally high activity against B. cereus.\n\nThis
  pathogen causes the gastrointestinal infection in humans called campylobacteriosis.
  A kinetic study on the inactivation of C. jejuni showed that  a Portuguese red wine
  rapidly inactivated the foodborne pathogen within 30 s,  ethanol and organic acid
  \ wine fractions acted synergistically with an efficacy similar to that of wine
  itself, and  wine enhanced the anti-Campylobacter effect of a food- and gastric
  fluid-containing model stomach, suggesting that concurrent ingestion of wine with
  food might help prevent campylobacteriosis. Related studies reported that C. jejuni
  was about 100 times more susceptible to inhibition by plant essential oils, oil
  compounds, and phenolic acids than three other foodborne pathogens.\n\nA study of
  the bactericidal effect of nonpathogenic L. innocua as a substitute for the pathogenic
  L. monocytogenes in a food matrix in a stomach model under simulated acid gastric
  conditions found that  red wine induced a 34 log CFU reduction of the initial pathogen
  count in &lt;2 h,  the combination of ethanol and malic and tartaric acids was less
  effective than wine, and  the kinetics of the bactericidal effect of white wine
  differed from that of red wine, showing that the antimicrobial effects of wines
  depend on composition. These results imply that ingestion of wine with food may
  reduce the Listeria level in the alimentary tract.\n\nThis phytopathogen, the cause
  of halo bean blight, was inhibited by Hungarian red wines and, to a less extent,
  by white wines, with the inhibition directly related to the phenolic content of
  the wines.\n\nWines are multicomponent solutions. Wine properties and components
  that have been reported to possess antimicrobial properties include acid pH, alcohol,
  sulfur dioxide, organic acids, and numerous polyphenolic compounds. A factorial
  design study on the susceptibilities of E. coli O157:H7 and S. aureus to 20 min
  exposure to four of these factors revealed the importance of pH, titratable acidity,
  and ethanol, but not total sulfur dioxide, in predicting inactivation, suggesting
  that lowering the pH would likely enhance the efficacy of the other parameters.
  The paramount role of phenolic compounds in inhibiting bacteria was not evaluated.\n\nA
  study of the contribution of polyphenolic content, pH, ethanol content, and other
  components to the observed antimicrobial effects of Croatian wines against E. coli
  and S. enterica found the following order of activities: wine &gt; phenol-stripped
  wine &gt; dealcoholized wine &gt; ethanol at low pH &gt; low pH &gt; ethanol, suggesting
  the antimicrobial efficacy of wine cannot be attributed to a specific component.
  The average TPC of these wines  was 3204; flavonoids, 2941; nonflavonoids, 262.6;
  catechins, 726.6. Anthocyanins were found at 239.7 mg M-3-G/L, and resveratrol was
  found at 2.00 mg/L.\n\nA study of three Argentinean wine varieties found that  the
  TPC content of the Cabernet Sauvignon wine  was lower than those of Malbec  and
  Merlot  varieties;  the relative antimicrobial activities against E. coli and L.
  monocytogenes in a meat model treated with 100 and 200 mg/L of isolated phenolic
  compounds paralleled the phenolic content of the wines; and  the polyphenol effect
  was ethanol-independent, suggesting that phenolic content governs activity and the
  need to produce new wine varieties with high polyphenolic content.\n\nA study of
  the antimicrobial effects of three Argentinean wines with different phenolic contents
  against multiple organisms showed that E. coli was the most sensitive bacterium
  to Merlot wine and that clarified wines, prepared by exposure of red wines to charcoal
  to remove phenolic compounds, were inactive.\n\nA study of the composition and antioxidative
  and antimicrobial effect of six Serbian wines prepared from different grape varieties
  against nine different pathogenic bacteria showed that the contents of two wine
  flavonoids, quercetin and quercetin-3-glucoside, can be used as biochemical markers
  for antioxidative and antimicrobial bioactivities.\n\nAn evaluation of Moroccan
  Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and Syrah red wine fractions against four Gram-positive
  bacteria, nine Gram-negative bacteria, two yeasts, and four molds showed that the
  Cabernet Sauvignon wine, as well as fractions with the highest monomeric anthocyanin
  content, were the most active, suggesting that these compounds largely contribute
  to the antimicrobial effects associated with wine components.\n\nAn analytical and
  antimicrobial study of the polyphenolic profile of GSEs from seven red and seven
  white Croatian grape varieties showed that  the total phenols, flavonoids, catechins,
  flavanols, and individual polyphenols  was variety dependent;  the TPC  of red skins
  of red cultivars were much higher in phenolic content than the skins from white
  cultivars ;  antioxidative properties were related to polyphenolic content;  the
  average content of highly bioactive trans-resveratrol of 0.29 mg/kg of fresh berry
  wt was lower than the corresponding value of 0.59 mg/kg of fresh berry wt in the
  extracts from the red varieties;  the corresponding values for cis-resveratrol were
  0.30 and 0.80 mg/kg of fresh berry wt, respectively;  minimum inhibitory concentration
  \ values against multiple organisms  ranged from 0.014 to 0.59 mg GAE/mL; and  MICs
  of white cultivars against E. coli and Salmonella, the most frequent causes of foodborne
  infections, were the lowest.\n\nAlthough present in small amounts in wine, resveratrol
  is probably the most widely studied flavonoid. This phytoalexin phenolic compound
  is reported to inhibit the growth of microbial species  as well as several pathogenic
  fungal dermatophytes that cause skin infections, to inhibit biofilm formation of
  E. coli O157:H7 and P. aeruginosa, and V. cholerae, to reduce the growth rates of
  numerous animal-associated bacteria in culture, and to exhibit cytotoxicity against
  T. vaginalis, the cause of the sexually transmitted disease trichomoniasis. It seems
  that resveratrol exhibits antimicrobial, antiparasitic, and anti-inflammatory properties
  that have the potential to benefit microbial food safety and human infections.\n\nWe
  previously reported that this olive compound inhibited both the growth of foodborne
  pathogens and the biological activity of a bacterial toxin. Because 30 Spanish red
  wines contained an average of 0.074 mg/L of 4-hydroxytyrosol, the compound probably
  contributes to the antimicrobial properties of wines.\n\nA study of the effect of
  the consumption of Spanish Merlot red and dealcoholized red wines by 10 healthy
  volunteers for 4 weeks showed  a significantly increased number of native gut bacteria
  and  decreased blood pressure and cholesterol, triglyceride, and C-reactive plasma
  levels. The results of this in vivo study suggest that a moderate consumption of
  red wine can inhibit nonbeneficial bacteria from the human microbiota and stimulate
  the growth of probiotic bifidobacteria. A related study found large interindividual
  differences in microbial metabolites in human feces following the consumption of
  red wine and dealcoholized red wine, suggesting differences in gut microbial composition
  among evaluated subjects. These investigators also analyzed by HPLC the total and
  individual polyphenolic profile of the two wines. Dealcoholized red wine had the
  same composition of polyphenolic compounds as red wine, with respective TPC values
  of 733 and 798 GAE. Individual polyphenolic compounds consisted of six anthocyanins,
  three flavonols, four stilbenes, six flavan-3-ols, two hydroxybenzoic acids, four
  hydroxycinnamic acids, and tyrosol.\n\nHere, we briefly describe the reported protection
  of wine marinades against adverse effects of foodborne pathogens and spoilage organisms
  on meat products.\n\nWe developed a series of antimicrobial wine marinade recipes
  each consisting of red or white wine extracts of oregano leaves with added garlic
  juice and oregano oil, against B. cereus, E. coli O157:H7, L. monocytogenes, and
  S. enterica. The results showed that  activities increased with incubation temperatures
  in the order 37 C &gt; 21 C &gt; 4 C,  storage for up to 2 months did not affect
  activities against Salmonella,  combinations of antimicrobials in wine exhibited
  additive antimicrobial effects, and  polyphenolic compounds isolated by chromatography
  separation from red wine exhibited exceptional activity at nanogram levels against
  two strains of B. cereus. The cited beneficial effects seem to have stimulated interest
  in defining the efficacy of wine marinades against contaminated meat products outlined
  below.\n\nThe populations of Carnobacterium maltaromaticum, L. monocytogenes, Brochothrix
  thermosphacta, and C. jejuni bacteria were reduced by 1.5, 2, 3, and 6 log CFU,
  respectively, on contaminated pork meat submerged into Spanish red wine for 15 min
  followed by storage at 4 C for 3 days. Except for C. maltaromaticum, ultrasound
  treatment with red wine acted synergistically against the pathogens, suggesting
  that marinating can be used to enhance the taste, texture, and safety of pork meat
  counts  and low counts  of C. jejuni. The bacteria were completely inactivated in
  both white and red wines. Immersion of poultry meat contaminated with this pathogen
  in both wine marinades was less effective in reducing the microbial levels.\n\nImmersion
  of contaminated beef fillets in Greek red wine or wine supplemented with 0.3% thyme
  oil for 12 h significantly reduced the levels of acid-adapted and -nonadapted S.
  enterica Typhimurium compared to nonmarinated control samples by 2.0 and 1.9 log
  CFU/g, respectively, during storage for 19 days at 5 C. The addition of thyme oil
  to the wine seems to increase the antimicrobial effect of marinades, suggesting
  the marinating can be used to extend the shelf life of meats.\n\nGreek red wine
  with and without 0.5% oregano oil induced reduced levels of S. enterica and L. monocytogenes
  on contaminated beef pieces after storage at 5 C for 18 h by 2.1 and 3.4 log CFU/cm2.
  Because the addition of oregano oil enhanced the antimicrobial activity and no changes
  in heat resistance were apparent during storage of the beef samples, wine marinating
  can enhance both safety and shelf life. Marinating with soy sauce or red wine marinades
  can control oxidation and microbial spoilage of raw beef, suggesting that marinating
  can extend the shelf life of meat.\n\nA wine-based marinade with added garlic powder
  or juice and a starter culture of Lactobacillus sakei induced loss of viability
  of L. monocytogenes and Salmonella spp. in a Portuguese dry sausage made from wine-marinated
  pork. A related study optimized the drying conditions to protect the sausage against
  Salmonella, Listeria, and S. aureus.\n\nAs described in detail elsewhere, there
  is a need to reduce both pathogens and heat-induced potentially carcinogenic heterocyclic
  amines in cooked meat products. Wine marinades without and with added herbs used
  as meat flavoring  reduced the formation of heterocyclic amines in pan-fried beef.
  Additional studies found no correlation between the marinade-induced antioxidant
  activities and individual or total heterocyclic amine formation. Related studies
  on the reduction of amine formation by wine-fried chicken breast are described by
  Brusquest et al. The concurrent reduction of both pathogens and heterocyclic amines
  by wine marinades with added herbs merits study.\n\nBrannan found that 0.1% GSE
  inhibited the intensity of musty and rancid odor and rancid flavor, but caused color
  darkening, on ground chicken breast and thigh during refrigerated storage, suggesting
  that the seed extract may be an effective antioxidant in precooked chicken products.\n\nThis
  section presents brief overviews of reported studies on the inhibition of growth
  and/or destruction of pathogenic microorganisms by GSEs.\n\nGSE incorporated into
  pea starch films with pork loins infected with the psychotrophic spoilage organism
  B. thermofacta reduced the bacterial growth on surface-inoculated pork loins by
  1.3 log CFU/mL after 4 days of incubation at 4 C. Additional studies showed that
  GSE films also inhibited the growth of the following pathogens: S. aureus, E. faecalis,
  E. faecium, and L. monocytogenes. The authors suggest that biodegradable and edible
  GSE antimicrobial films have the potential to improve meat quality and extend shelf
  life.\n\nC. sakazakii is a Gram-negative, anaerobic bacterium of the family Enterobacteriaceae
  reported to cause infection in adults and children, especially infants. Freshly
  prepared red muscadine grape juices induced a 6 log reduction of C. sakazakii after
  a 2 h incubation at 37 C, suggesting that red muscadine juice could inhibit the
  pathogen in baby food.\n\nE. coli O157:H7 is a foodborne, toxin-producing enteropathogen
  responsible for hemorrhagic colitis, bloody diarrhea, and hemolytic uremic syndrome.
  Here, we will briefly review reported activities of grape-derived products against
  this organism.\n\nA study on the effect of fresh and processed muscadine red grape
  juices against a 5 log cocktail of cells of E. coli O157:H7 incubated for 4 h at
  37 C showed that polar fractions containing malic, tartaric, and tannic acids showed
  strong antimicrobial activity and that synthetic tannic acid showed the highest
  activity. These results indicate that muscadine juice can be used as an active antimicrobial
  ingredient against these pathogens in nonalcoholic beverages. A related study by
  the same investigators found that water-soluble muscadine GSE prepared from the
  purple cultivar Ison and the bronze cultivar Carlos exhibited strong antimicrobial
  activity against a cocktail of three strains of E. coli O157:H7 and that heat treatment
  of both extracts increased antimicrobial activity, possibly because of increased
  acidity, tartaric acid, and individual and total phenolic content. These results
  suggest that water-soluble muscadine seed extracts could serve as natural preservatives
  in beverages.\n\nElectrostatic spraying of GSE onto contaminated lettuce and spinach
  samples with GSE alone and in combination with lactic, malic, or tartaric acids
  reduced E. coli levels on spinach up to 4.0 log CFU/g and on spinach up 2.8 log
  CFU/g during the 14 day storage, suggesting that electrospraying technology could
  help lower risks due to pathogen contamination of fresh produce.\n\nCommercial grape
  seed and grape pomace extracts inhibited antitoxin properties of the Shiga toxins
  Stx1 and Stx2 produced by E. coli O157:H7 bacteria. Because red and white wines
  and phenolic compounds isolated by chromatography from red wine exhibited strong
  antimicrobial activities against E. coli and other pathogens, it would be of interest
  to find out whether the wine compounds can concurrently or consecutively inactivate
  the foodborne pathogens and the toxins produced by the pathogens. We previously
  reviewed the inactivation of food-related microbial, fungal, and plant toxins by
  natural compounds.\n\nH. pylori, a Gram-negative organism that has adapted to thrive
  in the acid conditions of the digestive tract, causes gastritis, peptic ulcers,
  and adenocarcinoma. To help overcome multidrug resistance, Brown et al. evaluated
  the efficacy of muscadine grape skin and two polyphenolic constituents against H.
  pylori. They found that  grape skin and quercetin inhibited H. pylori infection
  in mice;  quercetin and resveratrol reduced the bacterial counts of the pathogen
  with MIC values of 256 and 128 g/mL, respectively;  grape skin extracts were more
  effective than the two constituents; and  the inhibitions were dose dependent and
  pH independent. The observed anti-H. pylori effects suggest that the extracts and
  components might be used in a diet-based approach for the prevention and/or treatment
  of H. pylori infection. A related study found that a comparison of the inhibition
  of H. pylori by grape seed, skin, and seed plus skin extracts of two grape varieties
  showed that the highest observed zone of inhibition was with the seed extracts,
  with MIC and minimum bactericidal concentration  values of 2048 g/mL of the extracts
  of both varieties.\n\nK. pneumoniae causes lung and urinary infections that occur
  mainly in hospital patients with diminished resistance. Because some isolates are
  resistant to medical antibiotics, there is a need for new antimicrobials to overcome
  infections associated with this pathogen. Ethanol extracts of grape seeds were found
  to be more effective in inhibiting K. pneumoniae than were grape skin extracts,
  suggesting a potential value for the seed extract against human infections. These
  authors also found that the seed extract was also active against E. faecalis and
  E. coli.\n\nL. monocytogenes is a Gram-positive foodborne bacterial pathogen that
  causes human listeriosis, with symptoms ranging from headaches to bacteremia, septicemia,
  encephalitis, and meningitis and a mortality rate of about 2030%. We now will record
  efforts to inactivate the pathogen with grape products.\n\nGrape juice and skin
  extracts from black table grapes strongly inhibited multiple L. monocytogenes species
  but did not inhibit B. cereus, Salmonella Menston, E. coli, S. aureus, or Y. enterocolitica
  pathogens. Fractionation of the extracts showed that the antilisterial activity
  was highest in the polymeric phenolic fractions, that activity of the red-pigmented
  fractions was pH dependent, and that the unpigmented polymeric phenolics from the
  seed showed pH-independent activity. The observed reduction was striking, from log
  CFU7 to undetectable levels after 10 min. Evidently, both pigmented and unpigmented
  phenolic compounds from grapes were bioactive against Listeria, but apparently not
  against the other mentioned pathogens.\n\nChardonnay and black raspberry seed flour
  extracts at 165 and 160 g seed flour equivalents/mL inhibited the growth of L. monocytogenes
  and E. coli with zero survival rates under the test conditions. These results and
  compositional and antioxidant activities suggest that the seed flours have the potential
  to serve as natural food preservatives for improving food stability, quality, and
  safety, and consumer acceptance.\n\nDipping of surface-inoculated  turkey frankfurters
  into soy protein film-forming solutions without and with antimicrobials  resulted
  in 2.8 log CFU reduction of L. monocytogenes after storage for 28 days at 4 or 10
  C, suggesting that the antilisterial activity of the combination was greater than
  that observed with the individual antimicrobials and that the use of antimicrobial
  films may enhance the microbial safety of meat products. Because the combination
  of antimicrobials caused a much higher 9 log cycle reduction in culture, it seems
  that antimicrobial results in the absence of food do not predict the efficacy in
  a meat matrix.\n\nDipping contaminated turkey frankfurters with 1% GSE plus nisin
  \ reduced the L. monocytogenes population from log 7 CFU/g to undetectable levels
  after storage at 4 or 10 C for 21 days, suggesting that the combination can improve
  the antimicrobial efficacy against this pathogen in refrigerated ready-to-eat  meat
  and poultry storage. A related study found that soy protein edible films containing
  GSE, nisin, and EDTA were more effective in inhibiting the growth of L. monocytogenes
  \ than E. coli  or Salmonella Typhimurium, suggesting that the susceptibility of
  the pathogens to inhibition is not uniform.\n\nDipping turkey frankfurters contaminated
  with L. monocytogenes, E. coli O157:H7, or Salmonella Typhimurium  into a whey protein
  isolate coating incorporated with GSE  and nisin  followed by storage for 28 days
  at 4 C reduced the bacterial population by 2.3, 4.6, and 1.0 log cycles, respectively,
  confirming that antimicrobial protein coatings can be used to inhibit foodborne
  pathogens in meat.\n\nGrape seed and stem extracts from the red Greek grape variety
  Mandilaria containing high concentrations of flavan-3-ols and derivatives represent
  a source of potent antilisterial compounds with low MIC values of 0.260.34. The
  extracts have the potential to serve as food additives to prevent the growth of
  L. monocytogenes.\n\nThe addition of tartaric acid and grape seed and green tea
  extracts added to chicken marinades significantly reduced L. monocytogenes in vacuum-marinated
  irradiated chicken breast meat without affecting consumer acceptance of the product,
  suggesting that the combination of the plant formulations with levels of irradiation
  below the maximum allowed could contribute to the prevention of contamination by
  Listeria.\n\nChitosan films impregnated with GSE inhibited L. monocytogenes as well
  as aerobic mesophiles and lactic acid bacteria on sausages during refrigerated storage,
  suggesting that the antimicrobial chitosan films could extend the shelf life of
  sausages.\n\nMaximum growth inhibition  of L. monocytogenes was observed in chicken
  and turkey hot dogs treated with combinations of potassium lactate and sodium diacetate
  with green tea and grape seed extracts. The antilisterial effect was enhanced by
  heat treatment of the hot dogs, suggesting that the extracts can partially replace
  the chemical preservatives and enhance the antilisterial activities.\n\nS. aureus
  is a Gram-positive, aerobic, toxin-producing foodborne pathogen that can also contaminate
  the skin, lung, heart, and other organs.\n\nA total ethanol grape extract prepared
  by the percolation method of whole grapes inhibited S. aureus, suggesting that the
  extract represents a natural antibacterial for possible treatment of local skin
  infections.\n\nPomace, seed, and skin extracts from New Zealand Pinot noir grapes
  were more effective against S. aureus bacteria than extracts from Pinot Meunier
  grapes, suggesting that extraction solvent, fraction, and grape variety significantly
  influence antimicrobial properties. A weak but significant relationship was observed
  between TPC and antimicrobial effects. A screening assay showed that bioactive polyphenols
  from pomace concentrated onto a protein-rich matrix inhibited the proliferation
  of S. aureus bacteria on the skin.\n\nV. cholerae produces a cholera toxin that
  causes watery diarrhea of cholera, an often fatal disease. Two grape extracts sold
  as nutritional supplements inhibited the cholera toxin, as well as the heat-labile
  Shiga toxin produced by E. coli in cultured cells and intestinal loops by blocking
  toxin binding to the cell surface. These results suggest that grape extracts could
  help ameliorate cholera in humans.\n\nV. vulnificus, a Gram-negative foodborne bacterium
  present in estuarine environments where oysters are harvested, has a 4050% fatality
  rate. Dipping of oysters contaminated with V. vulnificus in solutions of GSE, citric
  acid, or lactic acid  reduced the pathogens to levels lower than control samples
  during refrigerated storage for 20 days.\n\nThe MIC value of V. parahemolyticus
  in artificially inoculated oysters dipped in GSE solutions was 10 mg/mL; a solution
  of 500 mg/mL of GSE reduced the population below detection level.\n\nAn in vitro
  study showed that GSE was more effective in inhibiting Gram-positive bacteria  than
  Gram-negative ones, suggesting that GSE can inhibit the most frequent causes of
  foodborne bacterial infections in developed countries. A Turkish study found that
  GSEs completely inhibited Gram-positive  and, less so, Gram-negative  bacteria.\n\nGSE
  with a high total phenolic content  inhibited the growth of the following spoilage
  and pathogenic bacteria: Aeromonas hydrophila, Bacillus brevis, B. cereus, Bacillus
  megaterium, Bacillus subtilis, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. faecalis, E. coli, K.
  pneumoniae, L. monocytogenes, Mycobacterium smegmatis, Proteus vulgaris, P. aeruginosa,
  and S. aureus. It seems that GSE with a high polyphenolic content can act as a broad-spectrum
  antibiotic in food contaminated with multiple pathogens.\n\nPomace extracts  from
  five Turkish grape varieties inhibited pathogenic  as well as spoilage organisms
  \ in beef patties, suggesting that the extracts could serve as antimicrobial agents
  that can prevent the deterioration of meat products.\n\nPomaces from Pinot noir
  and Merlot Oregon grapes with TPC of 21.276.7 GAE/g DM, anthocyanin content of 0.350.76
  mg Mal-3-glu/g DM, total flavonoid content  of 30.2106.1 mg CE/g DM, and dietary
  fiber content of 5763% of total dry matter  showed higher activity against L. innocua
  than against E. coli. The pomace extracts were more active against the bacteria
  than the skin extracts. All samples lost significant amounts of bioactive compounds
  during 16 weeks of storage, with freeze-dried samples retaining higher amounts of
  TPC than samples stored at ambient temperatures or 40 C. The authors suggest that
  the two pomaces could be used as functional food ingredients that can promote human
  health.\n\nAn evaluation of the antimicrobial efficacy of grape pomace powder and
  pomace extracts from Turkish grape varieties showed that a 10% concentration of
  the powder completely inhibited S. aureus in vegetable soup at the end of 120 h
  and that this pathogen was more susceptible to inhibition than E. coli. The same
  authors also analyzed the data by an adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system, an artificial
  neural network, and multiple linear regression  models to predict antibacterial
  effects of the two pathogens in the soup.\n\nSupercritical fluid pomace extracts
  from Brazilian grapes were more effective against Gram-positive bacteria  than against
  Gram-negative ones. Seed and skin extracts from grape winery byproducts of the Portuguese
  Arinto variety showed higher antimicrobial activity against five bacteria and yeast
  species  than did some of the individual components, suggesting that the extracts
  can both protect against the adverse effects of contaminated food and be used to
  prevent or treat animal and human infectious diseases.\n\nPomace extract-based polysaccharide
  films induced 5 log reduction in bacterial activity against E. coli and up to a
  3.0 log reduction against L. innocua on a Petri dish at the end of a 24 h test compared
  to the control, suggesting the need to evaluate the films for applicability to contaminated
  food.\n\nWe evaluated the relative bactericidal activities of 10 presumed health-promoting
  food-based powders  and, for comparison, selected known components against the following
  foodborne pathogens: E. coli O157:H7, S. enterica, L. monocytogenes, and S. aureus.
  The relative activities were evaluated using quantitative bactericidal activity.
  The BA50 values were determined by fitting the data to a sigmoidal curve by regression
  analysis using concentrationantimicrobial response data. Antimicrobial activity
  is indicated by a low BA50 value, meaning less material is needed to kill 50% of
  the bacteria. Olive pomace, olive juice powder, and oregano leaves were active against
  all four pathogens, suggesting that they behave as broad-spectrum antimicrobials.
  All powders exhibited strong antimicrobial activity against S. aureus. The following
  powders showed exceptionally high activity against S. aureus : apple skin extract
  ; olive pomace ; and GSE. Listeria bacteria were also highly susceptible to apple
  skin extract. The most active substances provide candidates for the evaluation of
  antimicrobial effectiveness in human foods and animal feeds.\n\nSeveral studies
  describe anticariogenic/cariostatic effects of grape products. These include the
  following observations. Phenolic extracts with highly variable anthocyanin and flavan-3-ol
  contents prepared from several red wine grape varieties and their fermented byproduct
  of winemaking  were highly effective against virulence traits of the dental pathogen
  Streptococcus mutans, suggesting their potential value against dental disease. A
  study on bacterial adherence to enamel in the oral cavity of six human subjects
  revealed that rinses with red wine and teas induced up to a 66% reduction of adherent
  bacteria compared to controls, suggesting that these beverages might contribute
  to the prevention of biofilm-induced diseases in the oral cavity.\n\nA red wine
  GSE reduced plaque area on bovine teeth in an artificial mouth by 40% compared to
  the control. This value was, however, lower than corresponding reductions of 84.0
  and 87.5%, respectively, observed with Salvia officinalis and Rosmarinus officinalis
  plant extracts. An evaluation of the antibacterial activities of wine phenolic compounds
  and GSEs against potential respiratory pathogens present in the oral cavity that
  contribute to the formation of dental plaque showed that  gallic acid and ethyl
  gallate had the highest activity,  two commercial GSEs were more active than the
  phenolic compounds, and  Gram-positive bacteria  were more susceptible to inactivation
  than Gram-negative bacteria. Red wine alone and with added GSE inhibited oral microbiota
  in a five-species biofilm model of supragingival plaque. These observations suggest
  the need to evaluate the germ-killing efficacy of wine compounds in oral rinses
  and chewing gums.\n\nViral contamination of food and infection of animals and humans
  is a major cause of numerous diseases. The mechanism of antiviral action of plant
  polyphenolic compounds is based on their abilities to act as antioxidants, to inhibit
  essential enzymes, to disrupt cell membranes, to prevent viral binding and penetration
  into cells, and to trigger the host cell self-defense mechanism. Here, we present
  a brief overview of reported studies on the antiviral activities of grape products
  against pathogenic viruses.\n\nA polyphenol-based grape extract from Portuguese
  white-winemaking byproducts and resveratrol reduced adenovirus-5 production by 4.5
  and 6.5 log. In contrast to resveratrol, the extract irreversibly inhibited the
  replication of the adenovirus, suggesting its potential value as an antiviral agent.\n\nThe
  wine polyphenolic compound resveratrol reduced human cytomegalovirus DNA replication
  to undetectable levels by blockage of epidermal growth factor receptor activation
  in human embryonic fibroblasts.\n\nA study of the effect of commercial GSE on human
  enteric virus surrogates and hepatitis A virus evaluated the infectivity of the
  virus exposed to GSE concentrations of 0.5, 1, and 2 mg/mL for 2 h at room temperature
  or 37 C. At high titer, the infectivity was reduced by up to 4.61 log PFU in a dose-dependent
  manner, suggesting that GSE has the potential to be used by the food industry as
  an inexpensive novel natural broad-spectrum antiviral alternative to reduce viral
  contamination and enhance food safety and quality.\n\nThe foodborne norovirus causes
  gastroenteritis and diarrhea in humans. An examination of the effect of GSE against
  the human norovirus by a plaque and other bioassays for murine norovirus found that
  GSE at 0.2 and 2 mg/mL reduced the infectivity by &gt;3 log PFU/mL of the murine
  virus and the binding of the human norovirus to salivary human histo-blood group
  antigen receptors. The observed 1.52 log PFU/mL reduction in the murine virus titer
  following addition of 2 mg of GSE/mL to sanitized water in the washing bath of fresh-cut
  lettuce suggests the potential value of the treatment to reduce the viral burden
  of leafy greens. The mechanism of the antiviral effect seems to involve denaturation
  of the viral capsid protein.\n\nGSE was also effective against these viruses on
  contaminated produce. Thus, treatment of lettuce and jalapeno peppers  inoculated
  with human norovirus surrogates  or hepatitis A virus with 0.25, 0.5, 1 mg/mL GSE
  or water for 30 s5 min reduced the viral counts from 7 log PFU/mL to 2.33, 2.58,
  and 2.71 log PFU on lettuce and to 2.20, 2.74, and 3.05 log PFU on peppers after
  1 min at all three concentrations, respectively. The authors suggest that GSE should
  be considered for use as part of hurdle approaches that combine GSE with other antiviral
  treatments for foodborne virus reduction on produce.\n\nExposure of rotaviruses,
  the most common cause of severe diarrhea in children, to grape and cranberry juices
  and proanthocyanidins resulted in a loss of viral infectivity after 5 min via blockage
  of viral antigenic determinants caused by modification of viral integrity at physiological
  pH, suggesting that the fruit juices may help protect against viral-induced diarrheas.
  A related study by Ko et al. reported that an orally administered alcohol-free Cabernet
  Sauvignon red wine extract inhibited diarrhea in a neonatal mouse model of rotaviral
  infection, but did not prevent watery stools in the mice administered cholera toxin.\n\nNair
  et al. found that the flavonoid constituents of GSE seem to exert antiviral effects
  by inducing Th1-derived cytokine -interferon  by peripheral mononuclear cells, suggesting
  that the beneficial immunostimulatory effect of GSE may be mediated through induction
  of IFN-.\n\nGPE fractions extracted with methanol or ethanol from a mixture of Chilean
  grape varieties exhibited in vitro antifungal activity against the phytopathogenic
  fungus B. cinerea that damages grapevines, resulting in extensive economic losses,
  suggesting that the pomace can provide a low-cost fungicide to help overcome this
  problem. Related studies reported that pomaces from other grape varieties inhibited
  the growth of Zygosaccharomyces rouxii and Zygosaccharomyces bailii and that GPE
  from three Chilean grape varieties showed a large inhibitory effect on mycelia growth
  of B. cinerea with an IC50 value of 50 ppm.\n\nGPE from Brazilian Merlot grapes
  exhibited moderate activity against three fungal species, with MIC values ranging
  from 500 to 1000 g/mL. GSE acted synergistically with the medicinal antibiotic amphotericin
  B against C. albicans, the most common cause of fungal disease in humans, suggesting
  that the combination with 75% less antibiotic merits use in human fungal infections.
  The authors suggest that synergism of natural compounds such as GSE with medicinal
  antibiotics has the potential to benefit the fight against human infectious diseases.
  Phenolic red and white wine extracts also inhibit C. albicans.\n\nGSE from grapes
  and other plant extracts significantly decreased adverse effects in broiler chickens
  infected with the parasitic organisms  that cause coccidiosis, a poultry disease
  that results in large economic losses. The protection involved decreased mortality
  and improved feed conversion ratio, suggesting that antioxidant-containing plant
  extracts may be of benefit in the management of coccidiosis. A related study reported
  that a 0.1% GSE inhibited the intensity of musty and rancid odor and rancid flavor
  in chicken breast compared with control patties, suggesting that the extract may
  be an effective antioxidant in precooked chicken breast.\n\nPomace flavanols and
  flavonols  from Zalema grapes seem to be responsible for the increased survival
  of C. elegans worms exposed to thermally induced oxidative stress.\n\nIn addition
  to the research needs mentioned earlier, future studies need to address the following
  food and medical aspects of the properties of wines and wine flavonoids. In this
  context the term flavonoid represents wines, grape pomace, seed, and skin extracts
  and their flavonoids.\n\nDetermine whether the antibiotic activities of flavonoids
  and wines in vitro can be duplicated in vivo, especially in humans.\n\nDetermine
  the relationship between wine consumption and lower risk of infection in humans.
  Will frequent consumption of red wine or flavonoids protect against infection and/or
  ameliorate the severity of infectious disease in humans?\n\nDetermine how bioactivities
  of flavonoids vary, depending on whether they are tested or consumed in the free
  state or as part of a mixture or a food.\n\nDetermine whether flavonoid metabolites
  formed after absorption into the circulation by animals and humans possess antimicrobial
  properties.\n\nDefine additive or synergistic effects of mixtures of wine flavonoids
  with other plant antimicrobials, including plant essential oils, apple, and olive
  compounds, and seashell-derived chitosans. Combinations of food ingredients that
  act synergistically will lessen amounts needed to design effective antimicrobial
  food formulations. They will be safer and affect flavor and taste less than individual
  compounds.\n\nEvaluate the effectiveness of wines and flavonoids against antibiotic
  resistant foodborne and medical pathogens, a largely unexplored area.\n\nDetermine
  whether flavonoids can additively or synergistically enhance antibiotic properties
  of medicinal antibiotics.\n\nDetermine whether wine flavonoids can protect against
  bacterial infection through stimulation of the immune system.\n\nDetermine antibacterial,
  antiviral, antifungal, and antitoxin efficacies of wines and flavonoids in various
  contaminated foods including leafy greens, fruits and fruit juices, vegetables,
  dairy, meat, poultry, and seafood products.\n\nDevelop methods to simultaneously
  reduce both pathogens and carcinogenic heterocyclic amine levels in processed meat
  products.\n\nDevelop flavonoid-containing edible antimicrobial films and coatings
  to protect food against contamination by pathogens.\n\nDetermine whether flavonoids
  can prevent biofilm formation by bacteria on contaminated food.\n\nDetermine whether
  the flavonoid content of wines and byproducts can predict antibiotic activities.\n\nDetermine
  whether molecular modeling of flavonoid structurecell membrane interactions can
  be used to explain the antibiotic mechanisms of structurally different flavonoids.\n\nIn
  summary, because grape phenolic phytonutrients are considered to be generally accepted
  as safe, the cited and proposed studies will provide numerous benefits. The most
  active compounds could be used to protect liquid and solid foods against contamination
  by pathogenic and spoilage microorganisms and microbial toxins as well as therapeutically
  to treat animal and human infections. The grape pomace, seed, and skin extracts
  have the potential to provide inexpensive sources of compounds for use against a
  broad range of diseases. These byproducts will also provide a source of income to
  grape growers and wine producers. Growers will be encouraged to produce grapes with
