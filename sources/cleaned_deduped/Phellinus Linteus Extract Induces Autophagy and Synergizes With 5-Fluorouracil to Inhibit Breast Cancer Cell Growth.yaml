  Linteus Extract Induces Autophagy and Synergizes With 5-Fluorouracil to Inhibit
  Breast Cancer Cell Growth.md
text: '


  Phellinus linteus  is a medicinal mushroom due to its several biological properties,
  including anticancer activity. However, the mechanisms of its anticancer effect
  remain to be elucidated. We evaluated the inhibitory effects of the ethanolic extract
  from the PL combined with 5-FU on MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line and to determine
  the mechanism of cell death. Individually, PL extract and 5-FU significantly inhibited
  the proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells in a dose-dependent manner. PL extract  in
  combination with 5-FU  synergistically inhibited MDA-MB-231 cells by 1.8-fold. PL
  did not induce apoptosis, as demonstrated by the DNA fragmentation assay, the sub-G1
  population, and staining with annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide. The exposure
  of MDA-MB-231 cells to PL extracts resulted in several confirmed characteristics
  of autophagy, including the appearance of autophagic vacuoles revealed by monodansylcadaverine
  staining, the formation of acidic vesicular organelles, autophagosome membrane association
  of microtubule-associated protein light chain 3  characterized by cleavage of LC3
  and its punctuate redistribution, and ultrastructural observation of autophagic
  vacuoles by transmission electron microscopy. We concluded that PL extracts synergized
  with low doses of 5-FU to inhibit triple-negative breast cancer cell growth and
  demonstrated that PL extract can induce autophagy-related cell death.'
