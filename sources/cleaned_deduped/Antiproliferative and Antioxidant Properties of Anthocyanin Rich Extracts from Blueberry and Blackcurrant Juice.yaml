  of anthocyanin-rich fractions obtained from two commercially available juices on
  three tumor cell lines; B16F10, A2780 and HeLa. Individual anthocyanin determination,
  identification and quantification were done using HPLC-MS. Antioxidant activity
  of the juices was determined through different mechanism methods such as DPPH and
  ORAC. For biological testing, the juices were purified through C18 cartridges in
  order to obtain fractions rich in anthocyanins. The major anthocyanins identified
  were glycosylated cyanidin derivatives. The antiproliferative activity of the fractions
  was tested using the MTT assay. The antiproliferative potential of ARF was found
  to be associated with those bioactive molecules, anthocyanins due to their antioxidant
  potential. The results obtained indicated that both blueberry and blackcurrants
  are rich sources of antioxidants including anthocyanins and therefore these fruits
  are highly recommended for daily consumption to prevent numerous degenerative diseases.
  \n\n\nblueberry juice; blackcurrant juice; anthocyanins; antioxidant activity; cell
  viability; cancer \n\n\n\nDaily consumption of fruits and vegetables may have noticeable
  long-term physiological effects due to their bioactivity . Apart from many bioactive
  compounds such as vitamins, minerals, sugars, organic acids, dietary fibres, berries
  and vegetables also contain phenolic compounds including flavonoids, tannins, stilbenoids,
  phenolic acids and lignans .\n\nBeing part of flavonoids, anthocyanins are the greatest
  natural pigments giving blue color in plants and showing antioxidant potential.
  The chemical structure of anthocyanins seems to be responsible for this great property
  . Anthocyanins are the most oxidized flavonoids with the C ring fully unsaturated
  and a hydroxyl at position 3 . They also can be found as glycosylated forms of polyhydroxy
  and polymethoxy derivatives of 2-phenylbenzopyrylium, acylated or not with aliphatic
  acids . The richest sources of anthocyanins among many fruits and vegetables are
  the small berries like chokeberries, blueberries, elderberries and cranberries.
  Many researchers tested berry extracts against most common disorders and obtained
  significant results. It has been suggested that the consumption of colored fruits
  and vegetables are associated with reduced risk of human breast cancer , human melanoma
  cancer , and human ovarian cancer .\n\nBlueberry fruits are the most commonly consumed
  berries in Romania. Belonging to genus Vaccinum, fam. Ericaceae, these fruits are
  known for their potential health benefits against degenerative diseases. Several
  studies showed that a rich diet in blueberries help to support arterial structure
  by helping maintaining healthy blood flow via LDL oxidation, normal platelet aggregation,
  and endothelial function improvement . Matchett et al.  reported that blueberry
  flavonoids down-regulate the structure-degrading enzyme that enables cancerous cells
  to spread and invade other tissues. Blueberry extracts were also shown to inhibit
  the growth of tumor cells  and have anticarcinogenic properties . The most common
  anthocyanidins found in wild and cultivated blueberries are cyanidin, delphinidin,
  petunidin, paeonidin, pelargonidin, and malvidin .\n\nAnother rich source of naturally
  occurring anthocyanins in plants is blackcurrants. Originating in Northern Europe
  and Asia, these berries have been shown to have the potential to regulate and inhibit
  inflammation mechanisms suspected to trigger heart disease, cancer or microbial
  infections . Major anthocyanins in blackcurrant are delphinidin-3-O-glucoside, delphinidin-3-O-rutinoside,
  cyanidin-3-O-glucoside, and cyanidin-3-O-rutinoside .\n\nOur objective was to determine
  the total flavonoid, polyphenol content, antioxidant activity, anthocyanin profile
  and to evaluate the corresponding antiproliferative properties of ARFs obtained
  from blueberry and blackcurrant juice on several tumor cells lines.\n\n\n\nIn this
  study, the chemical compositions of two berry juices rich in anthocyanins were compared.
  In total, 14 different compounds were purified, isolated, identified and they were
  further tested for their antiproliferative and apoptosis induction potential. Chemical
  characterization of blueberry anthocyanins using HPLC/PDA-MS disclosed that the
  major anthocyanins identified were malvidin-3-O-galactoside, petunidin-3-O-galactoside
  and delphinidin-3-O-galactoside. Blackcurrant purified ARFs were characterized by
  the presence of delphinidin-3-O-rutinoside as major anthocyanins.\n\n\n\nThe anthocyanin
  identification was done based on their retention time, UV-VIS spectra and mass spectral
  analysis compared with standards and literature data . This identification was strongly
  correlated with the studied reference values . The absorbance was recorded at 520
  nm. The chromatograms obtained revealed the presence of numerous anthocyanins and
  their derivates in the analyzed fruits juices. The peak identification, retention
  times, identification and their concentrations are summarized in Table 1.\n\nFigure

  \n\n\nFigure 1. HPLC chromatograms of blueberry Vaccinum sp., and blackcurrant Ribes
  nigrum juices.\n\nUtilizing the HPLC–PDA chromatograms and MS spectra, 12 anthocyanins
  in total were identified in blueberry juice; with delphinidin and malvidin being
  the major anthocyanins. This was in accordance with recently published data . On
  the other hand, purified ARFs obtained from blackcurrant juice was characterized
  by the presence of four individual anthocyanins as previously reported , with cyanidin-3-O-glucoside
  being the major anthocyanin identified.  \n\n\n\n\nThe values obtained for anthocyanins,
  total flavonoid and polyphenol content of the purified juices are given in Table
  2. These compounds are found in large amounts in fruits and contain active molecules
  with health benefits . Total anthocyanin content obtained was 711.3 ± 0.82 mg and
  580.4 ± 0.86 cyanidin-3-O-galactoside/100 mL for blueberry and blackcurrant juices,
  respectively. The results for total phenolic content of purified juices were lower
  than those of previously reported . However, the values were in good correlation
  with data reported previously . The differences could be attributed to the specific
  methods used during juice preparation. The results can be a confirmation that berry
  juices could be a good source of phenolic compounds. In order to determine significant
  differences between values, analysis of t-test was performed. Significance of difference
  was defined at the 5% level.  \n\n\na Expressed in gallic acid equivalent,; b Expressed
  in quercetin equivalent,; c Expressed in cyanidin-3-galactoside equivalent,; # extremely
  significant, p ; 0.001.\n\n\n\nLiterature data relieved a strong correlation between
  total polyphenols, antioxidant activity, and antitumoral protection of polyphenols’
  intake . For measuring the total antioxidant activity, DPPH and ORAC methods were
  used. The DPPH scavenging activity of analyzed samples was monitored kinetically
  for 30 min and presented in Figure 2. The results were in agreement with previously
  reported data . The kinetic curves showed that differences among the analyzed samples
  regarding scavenging activity during 30 min were insignificant. Many studies reported
  antioxidant activity of fruits as ORAC values. This assay relieves the free-radical
  scavenging potential of antioxidants against peroxyl radical. For blueberry juice,
  23.5 ± 0.23 μmol TE/mL was obtained, which was in agreement with those obtained
  by Seeram et al.  and Prior et al.  while lower than the values reported for rabbiteye
  blueberries by Wang et al. . Regarding the ORAC values for blackcurrant juice, the
  results were significantly lower than those reported by Hosseini et al. . This finding
  could be attributed to different growth conditions of fruits and the methodology
  used to obtain the juice.\n\nFigure 2. Antioxidant potency of blueberry and blackcurrant
  juices using DPPH method. The inhibition percentage represents the antioxidant activity.

  ARFs obtained from blueberry and blackcurrant juices were evaluated for their antiproliferative
  proprieties on A2780, HeLa and B10F10 cancer lines. In order to evaluate the anti-proliferative
  effect of purified ARFs, the 3-(4,5)-dimethylthiazoly1-3,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide
  assay was used.\n\nFor all cells lines, the treatment showed a dose dependent decrease
  of cell viability. Among the tested extracts, purified ARFs obtained from berry
  juices exhibited high antiproliferative activity against different tumor cell lines
  used. The treatment for 24 h with blueberry purified ARFs revealed that cervical
  cells were the most sensitive to purified ARFs. The cell viability was decreased
  from 100% to 45.9%, A2780 52% and 56% for HeLa, A2780 and B16F10, respectively,
  after 24 h exposure to blueberry purified ARFs. Our results agreed with previous
  studies that reported high antiproliferative activity of ARFs from different berries
  . Regarding the effects of anthocyanins of blueberry extract on cervical cancer,
  significant inhibition of cell growth was reported in a recent study following the
  48 h treatment. . Anthocyanin-rich extract obtained from açai remarkably suppressed
  proliferation of C-6 rat brain glioma cells, while no effect was found on the growth
  of MDA-468 human breast cancer cells. Additionally, the same experiment demonstrated
  that the AEA treatment inhibited the growth of C-6 rat glioma cells dose-dependently
  with an IC50 of 121 μg/mL .\n\nFigure 3. The antiproliferative effect of blueberry

  test of Graph Pad Prism version 5.00. Data represent the means ± SD of at least
  three independent experiments. \n\n\nFigure 3. The antiproliferative effect of blueberry

  ARFs on cancer cell lines Statistical analysis was done using Dunnett multiple comparison
  test of Graph Pad Prism version 5.00. Data represent the means ± SD of at least
  three independent experiments.\n\nThe glycosylated anthocyanins from blackcurrant
  showed a dose dependent decrease of cell viability against HeLa, A2780, and B16F10
  cells with IC50 values of 281, 259.8 and 224 μg/mL, respectively. The results were
  similar with those reported by Olsson et al. . Therefore, a concentration of 200,
  250 and 300 μg/mL blackcurrant ARF for 24 h was chosen as standard treatment for
  the following experiments. Anthocyanin-rich black currant extract exhibited a potent
  cytotoxic effect on HepG2 cells .\n\nAn antiproliferative study conducted by Wu
  et al.  on B16F10 melanoma cells revealed that polyphenols obtained from pitaya
  peel and flesh inhibited the growth of B16F10 melanoma cancer cells. Similarly,
  recent studies showed that blackcurrant extracts had the potential to inhibit the
  growth of a number of cancer cell lines: HeLa, Fem X, LS 174, MCF-7 and PC-3 . In
  another study , inhibition of HT-29 cancer cell proliferation due to blackcurrants
  was reported 0%–51% and for Caco-2 cancer cell proliferation, the range of inhibition
  was 10%–56%.\n\nTo best of our knowledge, there is no study available yet regarding
  the effects of blackcurrant anthocyanins on cell proliferation of murine melanoma
  cells. Natural supplements, a rich diet in antioxidants used as a complementary
  medication, become a common field of research in order to develop new products originating
  from natural sources with antioxidant and chemopreventive properties. Berry fruits
  such as blueberry, blackcurrant, and raspberries are some of the richest sources
  of phenolic bioactive compounds: flavonoids, anthocyanins, phenolic acids, which
  are well known for their chemopreventive or antiproliferative potential.\n\n\n\n\n\nCommercially
  available blueberry and blackcurrant juices were purchased from local market. The
  semipurification was done by solid-phase extraction using C18 Sep-Pak cartridges
  following the procedure described by Giusti el al. . Briefly, the samples were loaded
  into an activated C18 Sep-Pak cartridge. Sugars, acids, and other water-soluble
  compounds were removed by washing with 0.01% aqueous HCl. Then, polyphenols with
  EtOAc was removed. ARF was eluted and collected in acidified methanol to avoid their
  degradation. The purified extract obtained was filtered through 0.45 μm for further
  investigation. The methanol was removed at 35 °C under reduced pressure. Following
  the purification, the obtained ARFs of the juices were dissolved in a known amount
  of sterile acidified water, filtered through 0.45 μm and then analyzed by liquid
  chromatography.\n\n\n\nTotal anthocyanins were determined by the differential pH
  method based on the property of anthocyanins pigments to change their color as a
  response to changing pH. Two dilutions of the same sample were prepared; the first
  one in potassium chloride buffer, and the second one in sodium acetate buffer, with
  pH being adjusted using HCl. After equilibration at room temperature for 15 min,
  the absorbance of two dilutions was read at 510 and 700 nm by spectrophotometer.
  Total monomeric anthocyanins were calculated as follows: \n\n\n\nwhere A = −; MW
  = cyanidin 3-galactoside molecular weight; DF = dilution factor; ε = cyaniding 3-galactoside
  molar absorbtivity in methanol/ HCl; L = cell path length .\n\n\n\nHPLC analysis
  was performed on a Shimadzu system equipped with a binary pump delivery system LC-20
  AT, a degasser DGU-20 A3, diodearray SPD-M20 A UV-VIS detector. For separation of
  anthocyanins, a Luna Phenomenex C-18 column was used. The mobile phases used were
  solvent A—formic acid in distilled water and solvent B—acetonitrile. The gradient
  elution was: 10% B, 0–9 min; 12% B, 10–17 min; 25% B 18–30 min; 90% B, 31–50 min;
  10% B, 51–55 min. The flow rate was 0.8 mL/min and the analyses were performed at
  35 °C. The chromatogram was monitored at 520 nm. Anthocyanins quantification was
  performed using cyanidin 3-O-galactoside. Anthocyanins identification and peak assignments
  were done based on their retention times, UV-VIS spectra comparing with standards
  and literature data published. As a confirmation, the samples were analyzed by HPLC-ESI-MS.
  For HPLC/MS analysis, the HPLC apparatus was interfaced into a Quadrupole 6110 mass
  spectrometer equipped with an ESI probe. Typical conditions for mass spectral analysis
  in positive ion electrospray mode for anthocyanins were: spray voltage of 3000 V,
  a nebulising pressure of 40.0 psi and a temperature of 100 °C. Data was collected
  in full scan mode over a mass range of 260–1000 m/z.\n\n\n\nFor determination of
  the total flavonoid content of purified ARFs, a colorimetric method was used . The
  samples were mixed with 300 μL NaNO2. The obtained mixture was incubated at room
  temperature for 5 min and then treated with 300 μL AlCl3. Afterwards, 2 mL of NaOH
  was added. The flavonoid content was expressed as mg quercetin equivalents/100 mL
  juice. Each determination was carried out in triplicate.\n\n\n\nThe antioxidant
  activities of the analyzed samples were measured using the method from Brand-Williams
  et al. . The reaction solution was prepared by allowing 35 μL sample and 250 μL
  of fresh prepared DPPH methanolic solution to react. The absorbance was then measured
  at 515 nm for 30 min. The antioxidant activity was calculated as follows: \n\n\n\nwhere,
  A0 is absorbance of the blank, and As is absorbance of the samples at 515 nm.\n\n\n\nThe
  antioxidant capacity was also evaluated by the ORAC assay, following the protocol
  described previously . The working solution was obtained by combining 150 μL sodium
  fluorescein solution in phosphate buffer. Then, 25 μL of each analyzed sample was
  added and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction was initiated by the addition
  of 25 μL AAPH solution. The fluorescence was recorded kinetically for 30 min at
  37 °C, at excitation wavelength of 485 ± 20 nm and emission wavelength of 525 ±
  20 nm using a fluorescence microplate reader. ORAC values were expressed as μmol
  Trolox/1 mL juice.\n\n\n\nThe A2780 human ovarian tumor cell line was maintained
  in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM glutamine, 1% penicillin and streptomycin
  0.1% as antibiotic. Human tumor cervical HeLa cell line was maintained in Dulbecco’s
  Modified Eagle Medium containing 1 g/L glucose supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
  serum, 1 mM glutamine, 1% gentamicin, 1% non-essential aminoacids. For B16F10 murine
  melanoma cells the grow media was consistent in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium
  containing 1 g/L, fetal bovine serum to a final concentration of 10%, 1 mM glutamine,
  1% penicilin, streptomycin. Cell cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified
  atmosphere of 5% relative humidity. HeLa and A2780 cells were placed on 96-well
  microplate and treated after 24 h. B16F10 cells were seeded on 96-well plate and
  cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS for 24 h. The culture medium was then replaced
  with complete medium containing concentrations in the range of 0–500 μg/mL anthocyanins
  for blueberry purified ARFs and 0–350 μg/mL for blackcurrant purified ARFs. The
  stock solution was prepared with complete medium containing 0.3% DMSO.\n\n\n\nProliferation
  was measured using the MTT assay. After 24 h, the treated media was removed and
  MTT solution was added to each well. After 2 h of incubation, MTT solution was removed
  and the formazan crystals were dissolved in DMSO. The solubilized formazan formed
  in viable cells was measured at 550 and 630 nm using the microplate reader. The
  results were expressed as percent survival relative to an untreated control. Each
  treatment was done in triplicate and repeated in five wells.\n\n\n\nIn this study,
  in vitro antiproliferative potential of ARF of blueberry and blackcurrant juices
  was demonstrated. The ARFs were analyzed for total flavonoid, polyphenol content
  and antioxidant activity. Moreover, HPLC-MS identification and quantification of
  individual anthocyanins was done. ARF were found to have strong antioxidant potential
  and inhibit cell proliferation on HeLa, A2780 and B16F10 tumor cells. However, there
  is currently no evidence that berry anthocyanins would significantly improve antioxidant
  status of organisms or the quality of life. In order to claim that blueberry or
  blackcurrant anthocyanins intake can reduce cancer risk, further studies are required
  to better understand their molecular pathways and also their metabolisms. Furthermore,
  this study contributes to the chemical characterization of two berry juices currently
  consumed in Romania, increasing the number of documented berry juices. Overall,
  all findings in this study comprise an important contribution to anthocyanin research
  in biological studies.\n\n\n\nThis paper was published under the frame of European
