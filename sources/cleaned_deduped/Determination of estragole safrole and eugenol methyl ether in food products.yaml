  A rapid and effective procedure for the extraction and determination of 4-allylanisole,
  4-allyl-1,3-benzodioxole  and 4-allyl-1,2-dimetoxybenzene  in food products was
  developed. These compounds were isolated from food matrices by employing a simultaneous
  distillation-extraction  technique with a Likens and Nickerson apparatus and using
  dichloromethane as extraction solvent. The method was validated by conducting recovery
  studies on fortified food products at several concentrations. Recoveries ranged
  between 94 and 105%. The analyses were performed by capillary gas-chromatography,
  the compounds identified by retention times and confirmed by GC/MS. The detection
  limits, determined both in standard solutions and in foods, were 10, 5 and 8 ng/ml
  for estragole, safrole and eugenol methyl ether, respectively and the calibration
  curves showed a good linearity for all the three compounds in the concentration
  range 0.5-25 ppm, with correlation coefficients ranging between 0.996 and 1.000.
  In a number of successive analyses, the estragole peak area repeatability  was 0.20
  ng/ml, whereas for safrole resulted 0.33 ng/ml and for eugenol methyl ether 0.45
  ng/ml. The estragole, safrole and eugenol methyl ether levels were measured in 42
  samples, for a total of six product types, including Pesto sauce, tomato sauce containing
  basil, Cola tasting beverages, Bologna sausage, Vienna sausage  and fresh basil.
  The levels ranged from below the detection limit up to 19.30 mg/kg for estragole
  in Pesto sauce.'
