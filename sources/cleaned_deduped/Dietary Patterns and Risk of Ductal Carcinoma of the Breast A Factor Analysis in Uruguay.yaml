  Patterns and Risk of Ductal Carcinoma of the Breast A Factor Analysis in Uruguay.md
text: '


  Breast cancer  shows very high incidence rates in Uruguayan women. The present factor
  analysis of ductal carcinoma of the breast, the most frequent histological type
  of this malignancy both in Uruguay and in the World, was conducted at a prepaid
  hospital of Montevideo, Uruguay. We identified 111 cases with ductal BC and 222
  controls with normal mammograms. A factor analysis was conducted using 39 food groups,
  allowing retention of six factors analyzed through logistic regression in order
  to obtain odds ratios  associated with ductal BC. The low fat and non-alcoholic
  beverage patterns were inversely associated  with risk. Conversely, the fatty cheese
  pattern was positively associated  as well as the fried white meat  and Western
  patterns. Ductal BC shared similar dietary risk patterns as those identified by
  studies not discriminating between histologic type of breast cancer.'
