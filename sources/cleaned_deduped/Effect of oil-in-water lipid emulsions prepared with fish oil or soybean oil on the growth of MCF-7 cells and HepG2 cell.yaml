  The growth of human breast cancer-derived MCF-7 cells was affected by oil-in-water
  lipid emulsions prepared with fish oil rich in n-3 fatty acids and egg-yolk phosphatides,
  but not by lipid emulsions prepared with soybean oil and EYP. On the other hand,
  the growth of human hepatocarcinoma HepG2 cells was affected by neither SO-emulsions
  nor FO-emulsions. The growth inhibition of MCF-7 cells in the presence of FO-emulsions
  was not affected by trolox, but was inhibited by Î±-lipoic acid, and was even potentiated
  by ebselen, which works as an antioxidant as well as a lipoxygenase inhibitor. Since
  prostaglandin E3, generated from n-3 FAs by cyclooxygenases, has a suppressive effect
  on tumour cell growth, and increases when lipoxygenases are inhibited, these findings
  suggest that lipid emulsions incorporating triglycerides of n-3 FAs might be effective
  in suppressing the growth of MCF-7 cells, possibly via oxidative stress and through
  eicosanoid production with anti-proliferating activity against cancer cells.'
