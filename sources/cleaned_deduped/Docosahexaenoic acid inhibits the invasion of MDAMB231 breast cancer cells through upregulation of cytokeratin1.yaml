  Docosahexaenoic acid, the main member of the omega-3 essential fatty acid family,
  has been shown to reduce the invasion of the triple‑negative breast cancer cell
  line MDA‑MB‑231, but the mechanism involved remains unclear. In the present study,
  a proteomic approach was used to define changes in protein expression induced by
  DHA. Proteins from crude membrane preparations of MDA‑MB‑231 cells treated with
  100 µM DHA were separated by two‑dimensional electrophoresis and differentially
  expressed proteins were identified using MALDI‑TOF mass spectrometry. The main changes
  observed were the upregulation of Keratin, type Ⅱ cytoskeletal 1, catalase and lamin‑A/C.
  Immunocytochemistry analyses confirmed the increase in KRT1 induced by DHA. Furthermore,
  in vitro invasion assays showed that siRNA against KRT1 was able to reverse the
  DHA‑induced inhibition of breast cancer cell invasion. In conclusion, KRT1 is involved
  in the anti‑invasive activity of DHA in breast cancer cells.'
