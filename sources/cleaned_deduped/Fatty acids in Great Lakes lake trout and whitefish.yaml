  acids in Great Lakes lake trout and whitefish.md
text: '


  Fish are an excellent source of lean protein and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids  but
  there is inadequate information on the levels of PUFAs in freshwater fish and specifically
  Great Lakes fish. Knowledge of PUFAs is necessary to make informed decisions regarding
  the balance between the benefits of fish consumption due to these factors versus
  risks of adverse health effects associated with elevated levels of contaminants
  known to be present in some Great Lakes fish and linked to increased risk of cancer
  and adverse neurological effects to both infants and adults. Our goal was to determine
  the lipid profiles in two species of Great Lakes fish, lake trout and whitefish.
  Total fat and the percentage of total and omega-3 PUFAs were with one exception
  significantly higher in lake trout than whitefish. Average concentrations of EPA
  + DHA were 11.2 and 9.7 g/100 g lipid in lake trout and whitefish, respectively.
  The concentrations of EPA + DHA in fatty marine fish  are about double those found
  in Great Lakes lake trout and whitefish. Nevertheless a 100 g serving of Great Lakes
  lake trout provides more than 500 mg of EPA + DHA, which is the daily intake level
  recommended by the American Dietetics Association for the prevention of coronary
  heart disease.'
