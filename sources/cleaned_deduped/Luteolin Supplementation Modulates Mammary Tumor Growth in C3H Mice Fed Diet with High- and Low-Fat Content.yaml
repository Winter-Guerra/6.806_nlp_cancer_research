  In this study we investigated the effects of luteolin supplementation on mammary
  tumor growth in C3H mice, a strain of mouse mammary tumor virus negative, fed either
  high-fat or low-fat diet. Animals were allocated into 4 experimental groups. Experimental
  diet were fed for 13 wk and 7,12-dimethylbenzanthracene was administered once a
  week for 6 wk starting at Week 1 to induce mammary tumors. Study results showed
  that animals on low-fat diet supplemented with luteolin exhibited longer tumor latency
  and lower tumor weights and sizes compared to the other groups. Animals fed high-fat
  diet showed increased serum IGF-1 levels and the elevated mammary tissue expression
  of Ki-67, IRS-1, pp38, Cdk4, and Cdk6. Luteolin inhibited IRS-1, Cdk4, and Cdk6
  expression in high-fat fed animals. The expression of pp38, cyclinD1, and Bcl-xL
  was suppressed by luteolin supplementation both in the low-fat and high-fat diet
  groups. These results suggest that excess energy supply increases the risk of mammary
  tumor formation and luteolin suppresses tumor formation regardless of dietary fat
  content through its cell cycle regulatory and proapoptotic activity.'
