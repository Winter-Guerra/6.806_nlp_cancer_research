text: '


  Allicin, one of the major components of garlic, has wide-ranging health properties.
  However, the effects of allicin on migration and invasion of breast cancer cells
  remain unknown. Allicin  inhibited TNF--induced VCAM-1 protein expression in MCF-7,
  but not in MDA-MB-231. Additionally, allicin significantly reduced tumor cell migration
  and invasion only in MCF-7 cells. Our results also demonstrated that protein interaction
  between ER- and p65 was down-regulated by TNF- treatment, and this effect was reversed
  by allicin. Moreover, the inhibition of ER- expression markedly enhanced TNF--induced
  migration and invasion of MCF-7 cells. Allicin strongly suppressed TNF--induced
  activation of ERK1/2. Collectively, these results suggest that allicin inhibited
  the TNF--mediated induction of VCAM-1 through blocking ERK1/2 and NF-B signaling
  pathways and enhancing interaction between ER- and p65, leading to the suppression
  of invasion and metastasis of MCF-7 cells. Therefore, allicin could be useful for
  preventing the advancement of breast cancer.'
