  Both PI3K/AKT/mTOR/S6K1 and mitogen activated protein kinase  signaling cascades
  play an important role in cell proliferation, survival, angiogenesis, and metastasis
  of tumor cells. In the present report, we investigated the effects of -caryophyllene
  oxide, a sesquiterpene isolated from essential oils of medicinal plants such as
  guava, oregano, cinnamon  clove, and black pepper  on the PI3K/AKT/mTOR/S6K1 and
  MAPK activation pathways in human prostate and breast cancer cells. We found that
  CPO not only inhibited the constitutive activation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR/S6K1 signaling
  cascade; but also caused the activation of ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPK in tumor cells.
  CPO induced increased reactive oxygen species  generation from mitochondria, which
  is associated with the induction of apoptosis as characterized by positive Annexin
  V binding and TUNEL staining, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, release
  of cytochrome c, activation of caspase-3, and cleavage of PARP. Inhibition of ROS
  generation by N-acetylcysteine  significantly prevented CPO-induced apoptosis. Subsequently,
  CPO also down-regulated the expression of various downstream gene products that
  mediate cell proliferation, survival, metastasis, angiogenesis, and increased the
  expression of p53 and p21. Interestingly, we also observed that CPO can significantly
  potentiate the apoptotic effects of various pharmacological PI3K/AKT inhibitors
  when employed in combination in tumor cells. Overall, these findings suggest that
  CPO can interfere with multiple signaling cascades involved in tumorigenesis and
  used as a potential therapeutic candidate for both the prevention and treatment
  of cancer.'
