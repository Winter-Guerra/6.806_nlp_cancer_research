  As neovascularization is essential for tumor growth and metastasis, controlling
  angiogenesis is a promising tactic in limiting cancer progression. Melatonin has
  been studied for their inhibitory properties on angiogenesis in cancer. We performed
  an in vivo study to evaluate the effects of melatonin treatment on angiogenesis
  in breast cancer. Cell viability was measured by MTT assay after melatonin treatment
  in triple-negative breast cancer cells. After, cells were implanted in athymic nude
  mice and treated with melatonin or vehicle daily, administered intraperitoneally
  1 hour before turning the room light off. Volume of the tumors was measured weekly
  with a digital caliper and at the end of treatments animals underwent single photon
  emission computed tomography with Technetium-99m tagged vascular endothelial growth
  factor C to detect in vivo angiogenesis. In addition, expression of pro-angiogenic/growth
  factors in the tumor extracts was evaluated by membrane antibody array and collected
  tumor tissues were analyzed with histochemical staining. Melatonin in vitro treatment
  decreased cell viability. The breast cancer xenografts nude mice treated with melatonin
  showed reduced tumor size and cell proliferation compared to control animals after
  21 days of treatment. Expression of VEGF receptor 2 decreased significantly in the
  treated animals compared to that of control when determined by immunohistochemistry
  but the changes were not significant on SPECT images. In addition, there was a decrease
  of micro-vessel density in melatonin treated mice. However, semiquantitative densitometry
  analysis of membrane array indicated increased expression of epidermal growth factor
  receptor and insulin-like growth factor 1 in treated tumors compared to vehicle
  treated tumors. In conclusion, melatonin treatment showed effectiveness in reducing
  tumor growth and cell proliferation, as well as in the inhibition of angiogenesis.

  Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer in women  with increasing incidence
  and mortality which is becoming a global public health problem , . Furthermore,
  breast cancer has a high mortality rate, mainly due to tumor progression and metastatic
  spread, which require neovascularization –.


  Tumor growth has traditionally been associated with angiogenesis, which is the formation
  of new blood vessels from the pre-existing vasculature. Angiogenesis is controlled
  by pro-angiogenic and anti-angiogenic factors in the body. The angiogenesis is regulated
  by several growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor, platelet-derived
  growth factor, epidermal growth factor, Angiogenin, etc . Recent studies have demonstrated
  that tumor progression can also occur through vasculogenesis. Vasculogenesis is
  typically followed by classical sprouting angiogenesis, where blood vessels are
  formed de novo by in situ differentiation of the primitive progenitors - i.e. angioblasts
  - into mature endothelial cells, which was thought to only take place during embryonic
  development , .


  Once a tumor exceeds a few millimeters in diameter, hypoxia triggers a cascade of
  events to allow angiogenesis and tumor progression . Hypoxia results in expression
  of VEGF, a potent endothelial cell mitogen –. VEGF is composed of a family of five
  isoforms denominated VEGF-A, VEGF-B, VEGF-C, VEGF-D and placental growth factor.
  Each of these factors can activate one or more receptors, promoting angiogenesis
  through its ability to stimulate the growth, migration and invasion of endothelial
  cells –.


  Hypoxia also up-regulates the expression of stromal-cell-derived factor-1α, which
  can recruit pro-angiogenic cells from bone marrow , .Hypoxia can also act in the
  regulation of RANTES a chemokine of inflammatory cells , . Other signalling pathways
  such as basic fibroblast growth factor and the receptor tyrosine kinase of angiopoietin-1
  can influence angiogenesis by increasing tumor invasion , , and vasculogenesis by
  mobilizing endothelial progenitor cells . Given the variety of signals involved
  in the formation of new blood vessels, several proteins can be therapeutic targets.
  Therefore, it becomes extremely important to identify the most susceptible target
  to a particular treatment, and to develop effective therapies that involve a combination
  of several factors , .


  Administration of melatonin, a hormone naturally produced and secreted in the pineal
  gland, appears to play an important role in tumor growth inhibition ,  and different
  mechanisms of action have been proposed . The action of melatonin is especially
  effective in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer by reducing the mitogenic
  response of cells . Still, melatonin can exert immunomodulatory and antiproliferative
  effects and act as antioxidants –. Furthermore, it has demonstrated that the pharmacological
  concentration of melatonin can inhibit angiogenesis directly or indirectly –. Recently,
  some studies have shown that melatonin can decrease the expression of Hypoxia Inducible
  Factor 1 alpha and VEGF in various cancers , –.


  The purposes of this study were to determine: 1) whether melatonin therapy effectively
  would decrease the size of implanted human triple negative breast cancer in a mouse
  model, 2) whether there would be changes in the expression of VEGF receptors determined
  by in vivo SPECT scanning in mice treated with melatonin or vehicle, 3) the changes
  in expression of angiogenic factors in tumors in response to melatonin. The ultimate
  goal was achieved by determining the therapeutic effectiveness of melatonin.






  All animal experiments were performed according to National Institutes of Health
  guideline and the protocol was approved by Institutional Animal Care and User Committee
  of Henry Ford Health System.






  Cell culture. Triple negative human breast cancer cells were cultured in 75 cm2
  culture flasks with Dulbeccos modified Eagles medium supplemented with 10% fetal
  bovine serum, penicillin and streptomycinuntil they were 80–90% confluent.




  Individual well of a 96-well plate was inoculated with 100 µl of medium containing
  5×104 cells. Cells were incubated in medium with different concentrations of melatonin
  for 24 h. Melatonin was diluted in ethanol 0.05%. In control cells, equivalent amount
  of ethanol was added as vehicle. Thereafter, 10 µL of MTT solution were added to
  each well and the plates were incubated at 37°C for an additional 4 h. To solubilize
  the MTT formazan crystals, the cells were incubated with detergent overnight at
  37°C. Absorbance was measured at 570 nm by ELISA Plate reader. Medium was used as
  background and subtracted from the samples. Cell viability was calculated for all
  groups compared to control sample. All experimental samples were in triplicate.




  Female athymic mice, 7–8 weeks of age and 25 g in weight were housed. MDA-MB-231,
  cultured in vitro, was harvested and re-suspended serum free media at a concentration
  of 6×107 cells/ml. The animals received subcutaneous injection of 50 µl of cell
  suspension in the right mammary gland or hind flank. These tumor cells are efficient
  in making xenografted tumors with almost 90% efficiency and show marked vascularity
  with less central necrosis. Two different implantation sites were chosen to determine
  whether treatment effects will differ based on implantation sites.




  Animals were randomly assigned to either the melatonin administration or the control
  group. Vehicle solution was prepared with 8 ml of phosphate buffered saline, 1 ml
  of dimethyl sulfoxide and 1 ml of Cremophor. The animals of the control group received
  100 µl of vehicle solution by intraperitoneal injection.


  Melatonin was diluted in vehicle and the animals from the melatonin group received
  IP of 100 µl of melatonin treatment for five days a week. Melatonin was administered
  1 hr before room lighting was switched off. Administration of melatonin prior to
  the nocturnal increase in endogenous melatonin may be most effective because tissues
  are most sensitive to the hormone at this time , .


  Melatonin or vehicle administration started on the day of tumor implantation and
  continued for five days a week for 21 days. On the 22nd day, all animals underwent
  SPECT scanning with Tc-99m-HYNIC-VEGF-c followed by euthanasia and collection of
  tumors for immunohistochemistry and membrane antibody array to determine the expression
  of different pro-angiogenic and growth factors in tumor extracts.




  Tumor volume was measured by digital caliper on day 7, 14 and 21 after tumor implantation.
  The major longitudinal diameter and the major transverse diameter were determined.
  Tumor volume was calculated based on caliper measurements by the modified ellipsoidal
  formula : Tumor volume = ½






  Recombinant rat VEGF-c was purchased from Prospec. VEGF-C, known as Vascular Endothelial
  Growth Factor Related Protein, is a recently discovered member of VEGF growth factor
  family that is most closely related to VEGF-D. Similar to VEGF-D, VEGF-C has a VEGF
  homology domain spanning the middle third of the precursor molecule and long N-
  and C-terminal extensions. Recombinant rat VEGF-c, lacking the N- and C-terminal
  extensions and containing only the middle VEGF homology domain, forms primarily
  non-covalently linked dimers. This protein is a ligand for both VEGFR2 and VEGFR3.




  Succinimidyl 6-hydrazinopyridine-3-carboxylate hydrochloride was synthesized and
  conjugated with rat VEGF-c as previously described . The conjugate protein was purified
  with a Centricon C-3 diafilter with a 3,000 molecular weight cutoff. Then, the nicotinyl
  hydrazine conjugate of VEGF-c was radio labeled with 99m-Tc-pertechnetate in the
  presence of tricine and stannous chloride as reported by –.




  An appropriate state of anesthesia was obtained using ketamine/xylazine. One hour
  after injection of 0.5 mCi Tc-99m-HYNIC-VEGF-c, SPECT images were obtained using
  a modified PRISM 3000 gamma camera dedicated to animal studies and fitted with multi-pinhole
  collimators. The following image parameters were used: 360 degree rotation with
  36 degree increments, 180 sec per projection, using 256×256 matrices with a field
  of view of 4×6 cm. Total SPECT image acquisition time was 10 minutes. After the
  SPECT analysis animals were euthanatized and the tumors was collected for further
  analysis. The projection images were reconstructed with HiSPECT software.




  Multi planar reconstruction and SPECT analysis were performed using ImageJ software.
  The tumor center was identified using orthogonal views and all sections containing
  the tumor, either in axial or coronal views, were added. Total activity of Tc-99m-HYNIC-VEGF-c
  was determined by drawing irregular regions of interests around the tumor and on
  the contralateral muscles to determine the activity in the contralateral side. The
  percentage of change in the total activity was calculated using the following formula:


  (Mean activity in the total tumor volume/mean activity in the contralateral muscles)100




  Animals used for membrane antibody array analysis were euthanatized with 100mg/kg
  of pentobarbital administration. The radioactive fluids were collected and contained
  in a shielded area to decay and the tumors were collected and snap frozen. Tissues
  from the tumors were mechanically pulverized over dry ice and total protein was
  extracted using Ray Bio 2x Cell Lysis Buffer according to the manufacturers instructions.
  Protein concentration in recovered protein extracts was determined using Micro BCA
  Protein Assay Kit using Bovine Serum Albumin as a standard.




  Custom RayBio Human Cytokine Array kit was used to analyze 20 protein expression
  in mammary tumors. All sample measurements were performed in duplicate, containing
  positive and negative controls.






  Table 1.  Custom designed protein arrays kit, which consist of 20 different cytokines/factors.



  Membranes were incubated in 8-well plates with 2 ml of RayBio 1X Blocking Buffer
  solution for 30 minutes. 500 ug of protein was added to each sample and the membranes
  were incubated overnight at 4°C. The solution was discarded and the membranes washed
  three times with 1X RayBio Wash Buffer I, and twice with 1X RayBio Wash Buffer II
  for 5 minutes each. BiotinConjugated Anti-Cytokines was added and samples were incubated
  overnight at 4°C. Membranes were washed with Wash Buffer I and II and incubated
  with 1000X HRP-Conjugated Streptavidin overnight at 4°C. After that, it was washed
  again with Wash Buffer I and II and incubated for 2 minutes with Detection Buffer.
  Membranes were exposed in a Multispectral In-Vivo Imaging System.


  The optical density of the expression of each protein was normalized to positive
  control and quantified using the ImageJ software.




  Animals were euthanatized, perfused by intracardiac injection of 10 ml PBS followed
  by 10 ml 3% paraformaldehyde and tumors were removed and fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde
  containing 3% sucrose. Tumor sections were prepared for paraffin blocking and sectioning.
  Standard histochemical staining procedures were performed as recommended by the
  suppliers of primary antibodies. The following antibodies were used to delineate
  the expression of corresponding antigens: VEGFR2, anti-VEGFR3 antibody, anti- von
  Willebrand Factor andanti-Ki67.




  At least two sections from each tumor underwent staining for different markers and
  used for analysis. Multiple fields were examined from each slide, especially demarcated
  areas with brown staining. There were signs of necrosis in the central part of both
  melatonin and vehicle treated tumors.


  For the analysis of immunohistochemistry slides, five areas were photographed at
  40× magnifications and saved in tiff format. VEGFR2 and VEGFR3 were analyzed based
  on the intensity of the staining by ImageJ software.Each photograph was divided
  into four quadrants and 20 spots were randomly selected in each quadrant, analyzing
  the intensity from 80 spots from each photographed area. The intensity was determined
  from a total of 400 spots marked on each slide. A negative control section of the
  corresponding staining was used for measuring background activity.


  Evaluation of micro-vessel density was detected by immunohistochemical staining
  with vWF. Each cell stained positive for vWF was considered to be a micro vessel.
  Five “hot spots” from each slide were identified and vWF positive areas were counted
  by two independent observers. The total histological area was noted, and MVD was
  calculated as previously described .


  Tumors were categorized in relation to cellular proliferation according to the staining
  of Ki-67.All Ki-67 positive cells were counted from each photographed area. The
  number of Ki-67 positive cells was normalized to the area of photomicrography.




  All data are expressed as mean ± standard error of mean. Comparison between melatonin
  and vehicle administration groups was done by Students t-test or ANOVA followed
  by Bonferroni test with GraphPad Prism 4.0 software. Any p-value of 0.05 was considered
  significant.






  We performed the MTT assay with different concentrations of melatonin to assess
  whether melatonin acts on the in vitro viability of MDA-MB-231 cells. As shown in
  Figure 1, treatment with 0.0001 mM to 0.1 mM of melatonin did not affect the cell
  viability after 24 hours. Only a pharmacological concentration of 1 mM of melatonin
  significantly decreased the cell viability compared to control cells and compared
  to all concentrations of melatonin evaluated.






  Figure 1.  Inhibitory effect of melatonin on viability of the MDA-MB-231 cell line.


  The MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with five concentrations of melatonin for 24 h
  and cell viability was measured by MTT assay. Data are shown as mean ± S.D. p;0.05,
  1 mM of melatonin vs. Control; #p&lt;0.05, 1 mM of melatonin vs other melatonins
  concentrations.





  To evaluate whether melatonin treatment reduces the breast tumor growth in vivo,
  we implanted MDA-MB-231 cells in athymic nude mice and treated then with melatonin
  or vehicle for 21 days.


  None of the treated mice showed any loss of weight and lethargy during the treatment
  for 21 days. On the contrary, the treated animals showed excessive movement but
  no irritability or aggressive behavior.


  The site of implantation of tumor cells did not alter the rate of tumor growth in
  the vehicle treated animals or in the melatonin-treated animals, showing that there
  was no significant difference in tumor development and response to melatonin treatment
  between the two models used. Thus, the two models were grouped together into one
  group for each treatment for subsequent analyses.


  Treated animals showed significantly smaller tumors after 21 days. The mean tumor
  volume of control and treated animals were 282.0±88.5 mm3 and 144.9±38.4 mm3, respectively.
  The mean tumor volume in control animals increased significantly from day 14 today
  21, while this was not observed in the treated group. Furthermore, there was tumor
  regression in an animal treated with melatonin. No similar pattern was seen in any
  of the control mice.

  To determine whether there were any changes in the expression of VEGFRs in the melatonin
  and vehicle administrated tumors, animals underwent SPECT scanning with Tc-99m tagged
  VEGF-c. Animals treated with melatonin showed lower activity of Tc-99-HYNIC-VEGF-c
  in the tumors compared to vehicle treated animals.







  VEGF-c was tagged with HYNIC chelators and then labeled with Tc-99m and injected
  intravenously in melatonin and vehicle treated mice. One hour after injection, SPECT
  images were obtained using dedicated animal scanner. Vehicle treated mice showed
  increased accumulation of Tc-99m-HYNIC-VEGF-c in the mammary tumor compared to that
  of melatonin treated mammary tumors C. Semi-quantitative analysis of total radioactivity
  normalized to contralateral muscles showing the intensity of radioactivity in the
  vehicle and melatonin treated animals.



  Semi-quantitative analysis of total radioactivity normalized to contralateral muscles
  showed that the intensity of radioactivity in the control animals was 183.6±20.9%,
  while the intensity of radioactivity in animals treated with melatonin was 150.5±17.1%.
  Although there was difference in the radioactivity in the tumors between the groups,
  statistically significant difference was not achieved.




  Semi-quantitative densitometry analysis of membranes showed that melatonin did not
  alter the pattern of expression of the majority of evaluated angiogenic proteins.
  However, melatonin increased the expression of epidermal growth factor receptor
  and insulin-like growth factor 1 proteins.

  The expression of VEGFR2, VEGFR3, vWF and Ki-67 was evaluated for the tumors after
  21 days of treatment with melatonin or vehicle by immunohistochemistry.


  Lower expression of VEGFR2 was observed in the melatonin treated tumors compared
  to vehicle treated tumors. Furthermore, melatonin treated tumors exhibited lower
  expression of VEGFR3 compared with vehicle treated tumors, but statistically significant
  difference was not achieved.

  Results from this study showed that melatonin at pharmacologic concentration was
  able to reduce ER-negative breast cancer cell viability in vitro. The direct effects
  of melatonin on mammary cancer have been studied in vitro, basically using the ER-positive
  human breast cancer cell line as a model . In physiological concentrations, melatonin
  suppresses the growth of ER-positive and some ER-negative human breast cancer cell
  lines in vitro . In addition, melatonin inhibited, to a varying extent, the proliferation
  of estrogen-responsive cell lines more effectively than estrogen negative breast
  cancer cells such as BT-20, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-364, Hs587t, T47Dco, suggesting that
  the antiproliferative effects of melatonin are mediated through the estrogen-response
  pathway , .


  However, agreeing with our results about ER-negative cells, Leman et al. showed
  that melatonin at pharmacological level decreases the proliferation of MDA-MB-231
  and MCF-7 cells significantly. Proliferation of MDA-MB-435 cells, which are highly
  metastatic and ER-negative, was not significantly affected by melatonin . Jung et
  al.  showed that melatonin showed weak cytotoxicity only at pharmacologically high
  concentrations of 8 mM and 16 mM in MDA-MB-231 cells. Melatonin induced apoptosis
  and inhibited the proliferation via the inhibition of anti-apoptotic genes such
  as BCL-xL, Mcl-1, cyclin D1, cyclin E, p-STAT3, p-mTOR, and p-AKT at high concentration
  in ER-negative MDA-MB-231 cells .


  Melatonin has been reported to bind and activate two distinct receptor types, membrane-bound
  G protein-coupled receptors, MT1 and MT2, and the nuclear orphan RZR/RORa receptors,
  members of the steroid/thyroid hormone receptor superfamily . MT1 and MT2 are expressed
  in human cells in various organs and in neoplastic cells, including breast cancer
  cells .


  Through the mediation of a subunit of G protein, MT1 receptors inhibit the activity
  of adenylcyclase, and thereby decrease the production of adenosine 3′, 5-cyclic
  monophosphate. This relationship makes it possible to control the activity of selected
  protein kinases and to influence the levels of transcription factor phosphorylation,
  that is, cAMP response element-binding, as well as the expression of specific genes,
  which code proteins involved in the proliferation, angiogenesis, cell differentiation
  and migration processes .


  Both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cell lines express low levels of the
  MT1 receptor ; However, overexpression of the MT1 receptor enhanced the growth-inhibitory
  and gene-modulatory effects of melatonin in ER-positive but not ER-negative human
  breast cancer cells .


  Recent studies have demonstrated higher levels of MT1A mRNA in the MCF-7 cell line
  compared to the MDA-MB-231 cell line , . Jablonska et al.  showed that there is
  lower expression of MT1 receptors in breast cancer phenotype of triple negative
  compared to ER-positive cases and the lower expression of MT1 is correlated with
  poor prognosis.


  However, through activation of the MT1 receptor, melatonin can suppress the development
  of cancer via a broad spectrum of mechanisms with and without involvement of ER
  . Oprea-Ilies et al.  showed that the MT1 positivity was associated with a lower
  stage and a smaller tumor size at time of diagnosis in triple-negative breast tumors
  patients.


  Furthermore, melatonin can exert antitumoral properties by a set of complex mechanisms
  of action, not necessary involving the receptor pathway . Melatonin may act directly,
  independently of its receptors or via them, making it difficult to understand the
  action of melatonin at the cellular level , .


  Since melatonin decreased ER-negative breast cancer cell viability in vitro, we
  implanted cells in athymic nude mice. Our results showed that melatonin treatment
  reduced the tumor growth with concomitant decreasing of cell proliferation.


  There are no studies about melatonin treatment in ER-negative breast cancer in vivo,
  but investigators showed the effectiveness of melatonin in treating rats with breast
  cancer induced by a carcinogen DMBA . In a study by Cos et al.  nude mice bearing
  ER-positive breast cancer treated with melatonin also showed smaller tumor size
  compared to control animals. Rao et al.  showed that melatonin at 50 mg/kg and 200
  mg/kg reduced the incidence of mammary cancer of TG.NK transgenic mice and reduced
  the number of tumors per mouse and tumor weights as compared with the control group.
  Although effective, the high-dose of 200 mg/kg caused significantly lower body weight
  with high mortality. On the contrary, in our study none of the treated mice showed
  any adverse effect, loss of weight and lethargy during the treatment with 40 mg/kg
  for 21 days. Liu et al.  performing a study with mice with gastric tumor showed
  that melatonin treatment in doses of 25 mg/kg, 50 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg reduced tumor
  volume when correlated with control mice.


  It is accepted that melatonin exerts an anti-tumor effect and multiple mechanisms
  have been suggested for the biological effects of melatonin but are not yet fully
  established . It has been shown that melatonin has direct anticancer mechanisms
  in several types of cancer, as pro-apoptotic, anti-proliferative, anti cell-differentiation
  and anti-angiogenic actions. Melatonin also has indirect anticancer mechanisms such
  as antioxidative effects and immune system regulation , . Little is known about
  the anti-angiogenic effect of melatonin. Some authors have demonstrated that a pharmacological
  concentration of melatonin may inhibit angiogenesis directly or indirectly, by inhibiting
  the proliferation of vascular endothelial cells  and acting in the inhibition of
  pro-angiogenic factors –.


  In this study, we evaluated the action of melatonin on angiogenesis in ER-negative
  breast cancer in vivo. Our findings were able to show that melatonin treatment was
  effective in inhibiting ER-negative mammary tumor angiogenesis, indicated by the
  reduction of VEGFR2 expression and MVD. Despite the semi-quantitative analysis of
  Tc-99m-HYNIC-VEGF-c showing lower VEGFR2 expression in the melatonin treated tumors,
  a statistically significant difference was not achieved. The non-significant differences
  of Tc-99m-HYNIC-VEGF-c activity between control and treated tumors could be due
  to the reduction of tumor size in treated groups and the relative expression of
  VEGFR2 remained unchanged since our analysis used contralateral ROI identical to
  tumor size. However, a decrease of VEGFR2 in melatonin treated mice was confirmed
  by immunohistochemistry.


  It is noteworthy that the efficacy of anti-angiogenic therapies can be evaluated
  by nuclear medicine imaging techniques using the tagging of radioactive isotopes
  to the specific proteins. Previously, Tc-99m was successfully tagged with different
  proteins and peptides using the new generation chelator, HYNIC . VEGF receptors
  have been used as imaging agents mediators of angiogenesis, since they are highly
  expressed in the vascular endothelium, and when injected into the bloodstream, are
  internalized by binding to VEGF, allowing the accumulation of contrast agents, such
  as Tc-99m , . VEGFR2 is the principal receptor transmitting VEGF signals and is
  overexpressed in the tumor vasculature compared with normal vasculature . One common
  mechanism for increased survival and growth of cancer cells is the deregulation
  of tyrosine kinase receptors like VEGFR2 .


  In this study, mammary tumors showed necrosis in the central part, both in vehicle
  and melatonin treated animals, which can be a result of insufficient and defective
  vasculature in a highly proliferative tumor mass. Hypoxia in tumor tissues is a
  leading cause of angiogenesis . Low O2 tension of a growing tumor allows stabilization
  of HIF-1α, leading to increased VEGF-A transcription, which binds to VEGFR2. Activation
  of intracellular signaling of VEGFR2 stimulates an angiogenic response, leading
  to cell proliferation, migration, permeability, survival and ultimately resulting
  in tumor growth .


  There are no studies evaluating the expression of VEGFRs in response to treatment
  with melatonin. We also evaluated 20 angiogenic proteins in breast tumor tissue
  and showed that melatonin treatment did not alter the pattern of expression of the
  majority of the proteins evaluated. Previous reports have described a decrease in
  the production of VEGF protein induced by melatonin in human pancreatic carcinoma
  cells and human alveolar adenocarcinoma cells , .


  Melatonin suppresses tumor angiogenesis by inhibiting HIF-1α expression and stabilization
  in prostate cancer  and HCT116 colon cancer cells under hypoxic condition in vitro
  . We evaluated the expression of HIF-1α in tumor tissue of animals treated with
  melatonin or vehicle, but there was no statistically significant difference.


  Melatonin suppressed the VEGF gene expression through the inhibition of the accumulation
  of HIF-1a only under a hypoxia environment and had no obvious effect under normoxic
  conditions  and in physiological concentrations .


  Regarding breast cancer, Alvarez-García et al.  performed an in vitro study and
  showed that melatonin may play a role in the paracrine interactions between malignant
  epithelial cells and proximal endothelial cells through a downregulatory action
  on VEGF expression in MCF-7, which decreases the levels of VEGF around endothelial
  cells. Lower levels of VEGF could be important in reducing the number of estrogen-producing
  cells proximal to malignant cells.


  Kim et al.  showed that melatonin treatment suppressed tumor angiogenesis and diminished
  the formation of the capillaries inside the tumor, reducing the tumor growth in
  mice bearing renal adenocarcinoma. In addition, it has also been reported in rats
  injected with melatonin while exposed to hypoxia, that serum VEGF levels decreased,
  which suggests that melatonin can suppress tumor cellular hypoxic adaptation by
  inhibiting angiogenesis . It is notable that a decrease in the expression of HIF-1
  and its target gene VEGF can happen by antioxidant action of melatonin, removing
  intracellular reactive oxygen species.


  These studies indicate that the regulation of VEGF by melatonin is highly complex.
  Many factors are involved in the regulation of VEGF synthesis, but the relation
  between melatonin and VEGF has been unclear until now. Perhaps, melatonin receptors,
  and its well-known immunomodulatory role and other additional transcriptional factors
  are involved in the actions of melatonin .


  In addition, semi-quantitative densitometry analysis of membranes showed that melatonin
  treatment increased the expression of EGFR and IGF-I proteins in ER-negative breast
  cancer. Margheri et al.  demonstrated that the anticancer effects of melatonin on
  breast cancer cell line MCF-7 were enhanced by its combination with retinoic acid
  and somastatin. The combined treatment resulted in a decrease in cell viability,
  which was concomitant with inhibition of a signalling pathway mediated by EGF. The
  oncostatic action of melatonin in ER-positive breast cancer cells MCF-7, probably
  occurs via its binding to the MT1 receptor and the alteration of key kinase pathways,
  for example IGF-I-PI3K/Akt, which were shown to be involved in the estrogen response
  pathway of the tumor cell .


  IGF-I is a growth factor that stimulates the growth of breast cancer. Rao et al.  showed
  that melatonin did not cause significant changes in serum IGF-1 levels in mammary
  cancer of TG.NK mice. Lissoni et al.  developed a clinical phase II, in which it
  was demonstrated that, in patients with metastatic breast cancer, tamoxifen therapy
  in conjunction with melatonin resulted in the decrease of serum levels of IGF-I.


  In this study we proved that melatonin reduces tumor angiogenesis in an ER-negative
  breast cancer model, but the detailed mechanism of how melatonin acts on angiogenesis
  in various cancers should be investigated in depth in further studies. Taken together,
  our results showed that melatonin inhibits tumor growth, cell proliferation and
  blocks tumor angiogenesis in breast cancer and the anti-tumor action of melatonin.
  Furthermore, melatonin treatment has not caused systemic toxicity to achieve the
  therapeutic activities, suggesting it as a potential therapeutic agent to breast
  cancer.
