  and reproductive problems continue to be a major health challenge worldwide. An
  impressive number of plant species is traditionally used to remedy such afflictions,
  and some have been investigated for their efficacy with positive results. A total
  of 105 plant species belonging to 91 genera and 62 families were documented and
  identified as herbal remedies for reproductive problems in Northern Peru. Most species
  used were Asteraceae, followed by Lamiaceae and Fabaceae. The most important families
  are clearly represented very similarly to their overall importance in the local
  pharmacopoeia. The majority of herbal preparations for reproductive afflictions
  were prepared from the leaves of plants, the whole plant, and stems, while other
  plant parts were used less frequently. More than 60% of the cases fresh plant material
  was used to prepare remedies. Over 70% of the remedies were applied orally, while
  the remaining ones were applied topically. Many remedies were prepared as mixtures
  of multiple ingredients. \n\nLittle scientific evidence exists to prove the efficacy
  of the species employed as reproductive disorder remedies in Northern Peru. Only
  34% of the plants found or their congeners have been studied at all for their medicinal
  properties. The information gained on frequently used traditional remedies might
  give some leads for future targets for further analysis in order to develop new
  drugs. \n\n\n\nAccording to 1999 WHO estimates reproductive problems, including,
  340 million new cases of curable Sexually Transmitted Diseases occur annually throughout
  the world in adults aged 15-49 years. In developing countries, STIs and their complications
  rank in the top five disease categories for which adults seek health care. Infection
  with STIs can lead to acute symptoms, chronic infection and serious delayed consequences
  such as infertility, ectopic pregnancy, cervical cancer and the untimely death of
  infants and adults . \n\nTraditional Medicine is used globally and is rapidly growing
  in economic importance. In developing countries, TM is often the only accessible
  and affordable treatment available. The WHO reports that TM is the primary health
  care system for 80% of the population in developing countries. In Latin America,
  the WHO Regional Office for the Americas reports that 71% of the population in Chile
  and 40% of the population in Colombia have used TM. The WHO indicates that in many
  Asian countries TM is widely used, even though Western medicine is often readily
  available, and in Japan, 60-70% of allopathic doctors prescribe TMs for their patients
  . \n\nComplementary Alternative Medicine is gaining popularity in many developed
  countries. Forty-two percent of the population in the US have used CAM at least
  once , and the use of at least one of 16 alternative therapies increased from 34%
  in 1990 to 42% in 1997 . The number of visits to providers of CAM now exceeds by
  far the number of visits to all primary care physicians in the US . The expenses
  for the use of TM and CAM are exponentially growing in many parts of the world.
  The 1997 out-of-pocket CAM expenditure was estimated at US$ 2,7 billion in the USA,
  and the world market for herbal medicines based on traditional knowledge is now
  estimated at US$ 60 billion . \n\nNorthern Peru is believed to be the center of
  the Central Andean Health Axis , and traditional medicinal practices in this region
  remain an important component of everyday life . TM is also gaining acceptance by
  national governments and health providers. Perus National Program in Complementary
  Medicine and the Pan American Health Organization recently compared Complementary
  Medicine to allopathic medicine in clinics and hospitals operating within the Peruvian
  Social Security System. The results showed that the cost of using Traditional Medicine
  was less than the cost of Western therapy. In addition, for each of the criteria
  evaluated -- clinical efficacy, user satisfaction, and future risk reduction --
  Traditional Medicine s efficacy was higher than that of conventional treatments,
  including fewer side effects, higher perception of efficacy by both the patients
  and the clinics, and a 53-63% higher cost efficiency of Traditional Medicine over
  that of conventional treatments for the selected conditions . According to , the
  sustainable cultivation and harvesting of medicinal species is one of the most important
  challenges for the next few years. \n\nThe present study attempts to give an overview
  on medicinal plant species employed in Northern Peru in traditional remedies for
  reproductive problems and female health, and compare this use to the western scientific
  evidence regarding their efficacy. \n\n\n\n\n\nPlants for the present study were
  collected in the field, in markets, and at the homes of traditional healers in Northern
  Peru in 10 2-3 months long field visits between 2001 and 2009, as a larger scale
  project following initial collections in southern Ecuador. The same 116 informants
  in the Trujillo and Chiclayo area were repeatedly interviewed during this time,
  using structured questionnaires. The informants were always provided with fresh
  plant material, either collected with them, by them, or available at their market
  stands. The questionnaires did not include any reference as to disease concepts,
  plant parts or preparations. In contrast, the participants were asked simple questions
  along the lines \"What is this plant used for, which part, which quantity, how is
  it prepared, are any other plants added to the mixture.\" All questions were asked
  in the same order. All informants were of Mestizo origin, and spoke only Spanish
  as their native language, and all interviews were conducted in Spanish. The study
  covered the four existing medicinal plant markets of the region, and included all
  vendors present. All interviews were conducted with the same set of participants.
  The specimens are registered under the collection series \"RBU/PL,\" \"ISA,\" \"GER,\"
  \"JULS,\" \"EHCHL,\" \"VFCHL,\" \"TRUBH,\" and \"TRUVANERICA,\" depending on the
  year of fieldwork and collection location. Surveys were conducted in Spanish by
  fluent speakers. Surveyors would approach healers, collectors and market vendors
  and explain the premise for the study, including the goal of conservation of medicinal
  plants in the area. \n\n\nVouchers of all specimens were deposited at the Herbario
  Truxillensis, and Herbario Antenor Orrego. In order to recognize Perus rights under
  the Convention on Biological Diversity, most notably with regard to the conservation
  of genetic resources in the framework of a study treating medicinal plants, the
  identification of the plant material was conducted entirely in Peru. No plant material
  collected either in this study in Northern Peru, or the previous study in Southern
  Ecuador was exported in any form whatsoever. \n\n\n\nThe nomenclature of plant families,
  genera, and species follows the Catalogue of the Flowering Plants and Gymnosperms
  of Peru  and the Catalogue of Vascular Plants of Ecuador . The nomenclature was
  compared to the TROPICOS database. Species were identified using the available volumes
  of the Flora of Peru , as well as , and the available volumes of the Flora of Ecuador
  . \n\n\n\nA total of 105 plant species belonging to 91 genera and 62 families were
  documented and identified as herbal remedies for reproductive problems in Northern
  Peru. Most species used were Asteraceae, followed by Lamiaceae and Fabaceae. Other
  families were less important, and 44 contributed only one species each to the pharmacopoeia.
  The most important families are clearly represented very similarly to their overall
  importance in the local pharmacopoeia . \n\nTable 1. Plants used for reproductive
  issues in Northern Peru and Comparison of reproductive treatments to the ten most
  important plant families of the medicinal flora of Northern Peru \n\nThe majority
  of herbal preparations for reproductive issues were prepared from the leaves of
  plants, the whole plant, and stems, while other plant parts were used much less
  frequently. This indicates that the local healers count on a very well developed
  knowledge about the properties of different plant parts. In almost 62% of the cases
  fresh plant material was used to prepare remedies, which differs little from the
  average herbal preparation mode in Northern Peru. Over 70% of the remedies were
  applied orally, while the remaining ones were applied topically. Many remedies were
  prepared as mixtures of multiple ingredients by boiling plant material either in
  water or in sugarcane spirit. \n\n\n\nTable 3. Species encountered and used in Northern
  Peru for reproductive problems \n\n\n\nLittle scientific evidence exists to prove
  the efficacy of the species employed as reproductive disorder remedies in Northern
  Peru. Only 34% of the plants found or their congeners have been studied at all for
  their medicinal properties. Aloe spp. are known to have oestrogenic activity .  reported
  that Artemisia spp. had effects on female health amongst the Cumash. A variety of
  other Asteraceae has been shown to be used against menopausal symptoms, while pumpkin
  seed oil showed testosterone-inhibitory effects. Chamaesyce sp. showed promise in
  the treatment of male infertility, while Mimosa sp. on the contrary are used to
  reduce spermal fertility . \n\nA wide range of Lamiaceae have been shown to exhibit
  contraceptive efficacy, and the same species are used in Peru for similar purposes.
  Similar efficacy has been shown for Sanguisorba officinalis , and Ruta graveolens
  . \n\nVarious species of Passiflora have aphrodisiac activity , and Myristica fragrans
  as well as Syzygium aromaticum , and extracts of Lantana camara  and Pilea spp.
  \ fulfil the same purpose, while Portulaca oleracea showed efficacy in relieving
  uterine bleeding . \n\n\n\nInfections of the reproductive tract, complications after
  childbirth, and reproductive problems continue to be a major health challenge worldwide.
  An impressive number of plant species is traditionally used to remedy such afflictions,
  and some have been investigated for their efficacy with positive results. An often-limiting
  factor to these investigations is lack of comprehensive ethnobotanical data to help
  choose plant candidates for potency/efficacy tests. Since the plant parts utilized
  in preparation of the remedies are reported in this survey, it serves as an indication
  of species that may need further ecological assessment on their regeneration status.
  \n\nThe results of this study show that both indigenous and introduced species are
  used for the treatment of reproductive system problems. The information gained on
  frequently used traditional remedies might give some leads for future targets for
  further analysis in order to develop new drugs. However, more detailed scientific
  studies are desperately needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the remedies
  employed traditionally. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRB collected/identified plant material analysis
  of the data as well as writing the manuscript. AG conducted fieldwork, data analysis
  and manuscript composition. Both authors have read and approved the final manuscript
  \n\n\n\nThe presented study was financed through MIRT/MHIRT a grant from the National
  Institutes of Health. Fieldwork for this project was supported through the assistance
  of a large number of MIRT/MHIRT students and volunteers. Thanks to all of them.
  None of the work would have been possible without the invaluable collaboration of
  Douglas Sharon and our Peruvian colleagues, especially curanderas Julia Calderón,
  Isabel Chinguel, and Olinda Pintado, curanderos Germán Santisteban and Leoncio Carrión,
  and herbalists Manuel Bejarano, Elmer Cruz, and Iván Cruz. Thanks also go to Eric
  Rodriguez and Abundio Sagastegui, Segundo Leiva, and Mario Zapata for the use of
  their facilities and their assistance in plant identification. \n"
