  Seaweeds are a famous delicacy in Eastern hemisphere. In addition to its food value,
  structurally diverse biologically active molecules with great pharmaceutical and
  biomedical potential have been reported to be present in the seaweeds. The epidemiologic
  studies have correlates the seaweeds consumption and health benefit effects on female
  subject. Furthermore, seaweeds and its derived components have extensively been
  investigated for their anti-cancer anti-viral activities. As seaweeds have the potential
  to both benefit health and improve food acceptability, seaweeds and its metabolites
  offer exciting potential as ingredients in the development of functional foods,
  nutraceuticals and pharmaceuticals. This contribution highlights seaweeds health
  benefits effects for cancer in female subject.







  The wide diversity of marine organisms is being recognized as rich sources of functional
  materials . Among marine organisms, seaweeds are still identified as under-exploited
  plant resources; although they have long been used as food sources and traditional
  remedies. In Eastern hemisphere, seaweeds have always been of particular interest
  as marine food sources. Seaweeds accounted for more than 10 % of Japanese diet with
  average consumption reached an average 1.4 kg/person/year . In Korea, new mothers
  are served with miyeok-guk after deliver their babies up to 37 days . Korean believes
  that miyeok-guk provide complete nutrition to help the new mother to recover and
  regain their energy.


  Seaweeds have been demonstrated as rich sources of structurally diverse biologically
  active molecules with great pharmaceutical and biomedical potential therefore it
  represents one of the most nutritious plant foods . The tradition and everyday habits
  of seaweeds consumption has made possible a large numbers of epidemiological studies
  showing the health benefits linked to seaweeds consumption. Considering combination
  with international diet-related chronic disease incidences, a significant environmental
  factors including dietary difference between populations varying in seaweeds consumption
  have revealed. For example, several epidemiologic studies show that seaweeds consumption
  correlates with low breast cancer rates in Japan and China compared to North America
  and Europe . It has also been reported that neurodegenerative cases in East Asian
  countries were lower than Europe .


  General utilization of seaweeds in food products has grown steadily since the early
  1980s. In recent years, consumers in developed countries are turning to more natural
  and nutritional foods, particularly seaweeds. Seaweeds have recently been approved
  in France for human consumption, thus opening for the food and fisheries industries.
  During 2003, it was estimated that about one million tons of seaweeds were harvested
  in thirty-five countries mainly as food sources. Several seaweeds species are consumed
  by human directly after only minor pre-processing such as drying. Porphyra sp. which
  is commercially known as nori or lavers are the most widely consumed among edible
  red seaweeds worldwide. Among green seaweeds, sea lettuces are the most common,
  ubiquitous, and environmentally important genera. Sea lettuces comprise the genus
  Ulva, a group of edible green seaweeds which is widely distributed along the coasts
  of the world’s oceans and often found in the mid and upper tidal zones. Sea lettuces
  or sometimes termed as green laver are found in tidal and near tidal seawater worldwide,
  generally anchored to rocks or other algae. They are easily identified by its paper
  thin, semi translucent, and vibrant green color. Most sea lettuces are gathered
  wild as it grows prolifically wherever there are sufficient nutrients, but some
  is farmed. Many species of sea lettuces are reported to be tolerant of organic and
  metal pollution; hence, if we consumed, we need to make sure they are collected
  far from any potential sources of pollution.




  In recent years, nutritional value, and potential health benefits of marine algae
  have been intensively investigated and reviewed. In spite of extensive studies and
  reviews on nutritional value, and potential health benefits of marine algae for
  human, there is little available literature focusing on potential benefits role
  of seaweeds in female subject. Hence, this contribution focuses on biological roles
  of seaweeds and presents an overview of their potential benefits for female health
  .






  Breast cancer is the second most common frequent cancer in the world, and is by
  far the most leading cause of cancer-related death among female worldwide . Globally,
  more than 1 million patients are diagnosed annually, representing around 10 % of
  all newly diagnosed cancer cases . Geographical variation incidence and mortality
  rates of breast cancer suggest that the known risk factors for breast cancer may
  vary and that environmental factors are of greater importance than genetic factors
  . For example, the mortality rate for premenopausal breast cancer is almost four
  times greater in the Western world, compared with Eastern and one importance difference
  in the diet between these two populations is higher consumption of fish and seaweeds
  in the Eastern populations .


  Traditional Eastern breast cancer medicine has long used seaweeds as a cancer treatment
  to “soften” tumors and “reduce” nodulation. Teas et al. demonstrated that diet containing
  5 %Laminaria angustata significantly delays the tumors occurrence in female Sprague-Dawley
  rats induced with the carcinogen 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene . Furthermore, Yamamoto
  et al. reported that only 2 % of Porphyra tenera, L. religiosa or L. japonica var
  ochotensis is necessary to obtain the same protective effect . In accordance, wakame
  and mekabu have been showed to reduce the incidence, multiplicity and size of breast
  tumors in female Sprague-Dawley rats induced with DMBA . Considering that wakame
  and mekabu is particularly rich in iodine, Funahashi et al. suggested that the cancer
  inhibition was brought about by the iodine. A number of studies have reported the
  importance of iodine in the treatments for mammary gland dysfunctions. Iodine deficiency
  have been demonstrated to alters the structure and function of mammary gland in
  virgin rats, and iodine components is effective in diminishing ductal hyperplasia
  and perilobular fibrosis secondary to this iodine deficiency . Similarly, I2 treatment
  of patients with benign breast disease is accompanied by a significant bilateral
  reduction in breast size, which further leads to a remission of disease symptoms.
  The importance of I2 in the treatments for mammary gland dysfunctions has been corroborated
  in human and animal models .


  Dioxinodehydroeckol, a phloroglucinol derivative from Ecklonia cava, has a potential
  inhibitory effect against growth of human breast cancer cells MCF-7 via induction
  of apoptosis . One µg/ml mekabu strongly induced apoptosis in three human breast
  cancer cell line, the induction of apoptosis even greater than 5-fluorouracil, a
  chemotherapeutic agent frequently used in human breast cancer clinics. More recently,
  fucoxanthin the brown pigment which colors kelp and other brown seaweeds induced
  strong cytotoxicity against breast cancer MCF-7 cells with IC50 = 11.5 μg/ml . In
  addition, sulfated polysaccharides derived from brown algae , fucoidan induced apoptosis
  in breast cancer 4T1 cells through down-regulation of VEGF. Furthermore, intraperitoneal
  injection of fucoidan in mice breast cancer models reduced the tumor volume and
  weight significantly . The enhanced antitumor efficacy was associated with decreased
  angiogenesis and increased induction of apoptosis. Apoptosis is a key process in
  cancer development and progression which can be characterized through distinct set
  of morphological and biochemical progresses. Inactivation of apoptosis has been
  considered to be one of six fundamental hallmarks of cancer; therefore, apoptosis
  is a major target of cancer therapy development up to present . Hence, development
  of molecules derived from marine algae which promote apoptosis in breast cancer
  cells by targeting both the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways may lead
  to the development of effective breast cancer therapies.

  Estrogen-dependent cancers are among the leading causes of morbidity and mortality
  in American female . Increased incidence of these cancers is predicted in the future,
  and the need for primary prevention is clear. Epidemiological studies demonstrated
  that estrogen dependent breast cancers are among the highest in Western, industrialized
  countries, while rates are much lower in China and Japan . Due to some research
  study, low estrogen-dependent cancers rates have been attributed to the soy-rich
  and seaweeds diets inherent among Asian populations . As an example, dietary intake
  of Alaria esculenta and soy protein has been reported to modify estrogen and phytoestrogen
  metabolism in healthy postmenopausal female . In another female pilot study, Skibola
  et al. demonstrated that intake of Fucus vesiculosus significantly increased the
  total number of days of the menstrual cycle, reduced circulating 17β-estradiol levels,
  and elevated serum progesterone levels in premenopausal female with abnormal menstrual
  cycling histories . Moreover, F. vesiculosus have been demonstrated to modulate
  endocrine hormones in female sprague-dawley rats and human luteinized granulose
  cells . Hence, it may assumed that intake of seaweeds may contribute to the lower
  estrogen circulating level which may correlate to the lower incidence of hormone-dependent
  cancers in female.


  Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer in female worldwide and more female
  die annually because of cervical cancer rather than from AIDS . It is the principal
  cancer of female in most developing countries, where 80 % cases occur . Recent reports
  demonstrated that several marine algae species: Palmaria palmate, Laminaria setchellii,
  Macrocystis integrifolia, Nereocystis leutkeana, Udotea flabellum and Udotea conglutinate
  extracts were able to inhibit cervical cancers cell proliferations in vitro . Fundamentally,
  cancer is the increase in tumor cell number, and thus tumor burden, which ultimately
  accounts for the adverse effects on the host. The goal of most current cancer therapy
  is to reduce the number of tumor cells and to prevent their further accumulation.
  Hence, anti-proliferative activity of marine algae in cervical cancer cells demonstrated
  potential of marine algae as therapeutic agent for cervical cancer treatment.


  Additionally, formation of cancer cells in human body can be directly induced by
  free radicals and natural anticancer drugs as chemopreventive agents have gained
  a positive popularity in treatment of cancer. Therefore, seaweed derived-radical
  scavenging molecules such as phlorotannins , carotenoids, sulfated polysaccharides
  and carmamol derivatives can be used indirectly to reduce cancer formation in the
  female body. Antioxidant activity of seaweeds and its bioactive molecules have been
  determined by various methods such as ferric thiocyanate, thiobarbituric acid, 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl
  radical scavenging, 2,2′-azinobis-3-ethylbenzothizoline-6-sulfonate radical scavenging
  effect, singlet oxygen quenching activity, lipid peroxide inhibition, superoxide
  radical and hydroxyl radical scavenging assays .


  Seaweeds and seaweed derived-metabolites have shown promising anticancer activities
  and hence, seaweeds have a great potential to improve female health by being a part
  of anticancer functional foods and nutraceuticals. However, future studies focusing
  on the synergistic benefits of consuming different seaweeds, intake timing, recommended
  amounts of seaweeds consumption, and preparation methods for seaweeds is needed
  to maximize the desired protective effect in cancer managements.




  Human papilloma virus is a sexually transmitted virus from the papillomavirus family.
  HPV infections of the cervix and vagina have emerged as the most common sexually
  transmitted diseases among young sexually active populations. In the US, an estimated
  75 % of the reproductive-age populations have been infected with genital strains
  of HPV . HPV Infection by certain HPV types in female genital has been associated
  with cervical cancer and cervical dysplasia . For this reasons, the diagnosis of
  symptomatic genital warts caused by the HPV and HPV prevention strategies have skyrocketed
  during the last three decades.


  The first generation of HPV vaccine is currently available on the market to prevent
  HPV infection . However, high cost of vaccine has been a cause for concern and will
  be too expensive for use in the developing world. Moreover, there is considerable
  uncertainty about the most effective strategy for vaccination and the likely impact
  of vaccination on HPV and cancer incidence . Therefore, the search for potential
  anti-HPV candidates containing higher inhibitory activity and fewer prices has rise
  great interest in pharmaceutical industries. In this regard, natural bioactive compounds
  and their derivatives are potential source for the development of functional foods
  as new generation anti-HPV therapeutics which is more effective, less side effects
  and less expensive.


  Seaweeds contain significant quantities of complex structural sulfated polysaccharides
  which have been demonstrated as potent inhibitors of wide variety of viruses, including
  . Carrageenan, a sulfated linear polysaccharides of d-galactose and 3,6-anhydro-d-galactose
  extracted from the Rhodophyceae, has been used in food products for centuries. Recently,
  carrageenan has been shown to bear anti-HPV activity in vitro . Buck et al. noted
  that carrageenan particularly ι–carrageenan inhibit HPV three orders magnitude more
  potent than heparin, a highly effective model for HPV inhibitor . Carrageenan acts
  primarily by preventing the binding of HPV virions to cells and block HPV infection
  through a second, post attachment heparin sulfate-independent effect. Those mechanism
  is consistent by the fact that carrageenan resembles heparin sulfate, which is known
  as HPV-cell attachment factor. Furthermore, some of milk-based products block HPV
  infectivity in vitro, even when diluted million-fold . In another study, carrageenan
  has been reported to inhibit genital transmission of HPV in female mouse model of
  cervicovaginal . Carrageenan was able to generate antigen-specific immune responses
  and antitumor effects in female mice vaccinated with HPV-16 E7 peptide vaccine .


  Carrageenan can be an alternative source of novel therapeutic candidate for HPV
  by being a part of food additives. There are numerous advantages of carrageenan
  over other classes of anti-HPV agents, such as relatively low production costs,
  broad spectrum of anti-HPV properties, low cytotoxicity, safety, wide acceptability
  and novel modes of action, suggest carrageenan are promising candidates in the near
  future.




  Obesity is a major risk factor for developing cancer, roughly equivalent of tobacco
  use, and both are potentially reversible. Around one-fifth of cancer deaths in the
  United States are associated with obesity. Further, obese cancer patients do worse
  in surgery, with radiation or chemotherapy. While the links among obesity, diabetes
  and heart disease are well-known, there is considerably less public awareness that
  obesity is also directly tied to several cancers. These include some of the toughest
  to treat: postmenopausal breast; cervical; ovarian; colon and rectal; endometrial,
  esophageal; thyroid; gallbladder; kidney; and pancreatic cancer. Studies also show
  higher recurrence and mortality rates for overweight and obese patients and survivors.


  Obesity may occur in any gender; however, it is more likely to occur in female .
  Females of industrialized and developing countries are experiencing increases in
  the prevalence of obesity, diabetes, and high cholesterol . A detrimental effect
  of obesity on female reproductive system has also been demonstrated consistently.
  Furthermore, it is reported that media and socio-cultural continues to pressures
  young female to be thin which promotes body dissatisfaction, eating disturbance,
  depression and negative effect in young female . Therefore, female may pay a higher
  health price for obesity. Despite these increases and detrimental effect, prevention
  opportunities exist to improve female’s health during their reproductive years and
  beyond and to improve the health of future generations. Many categories of natural
  and synthetic compounds which demonstrated as anti-obesity drugs have been used
  by female to reduce their weight. However, synthetic anti-obesity agents are believed
  to have certain side effects such as unacceptable tachycardia, hypertension, improve
  lipid blood levels, improve glucose metabolism and disturbance of female reproductive
  system . Hence, more scientific efforts have been dedicated to study medicinal foods
  that can act as anti-obesity agents.


  In the last four decades, researchers have found that soluble dietary fibers are
  negatively associated with obesity. Seaweeds is particularly rich two different
  types of fiber, soluble and insoluble. As an example, Eisenia bicyclis contains
  more than 50 % soluble fiber of its dry weight; the other brown algae species, Fucus
  vesiculosus contained more than 40 % insoluble fiber per dry weight . In human body,
  soluble and insoluble fiber acts in a very different way. Consumption of marine
  algae soluble fiber such as carrageenan, agar, and alginate are primarily associated
  with hypocholesterolemic and hypoglycemic effects . Alginates consumptions have
  been shown to modulate appetite and energy intake in human models of acute feeding.
  Upon reaction with gastric acid, alginates undergo ionic gelation to form an alginate
  gel that can slow gastric emptying, stimulate gastric stretch receptors and reduce
  intestinal nutrient uptake and influence the glycaemic response . In accordance,
  ingesting calcium-gelled, alginate-pectin twice per day has been reported to reduce
  spontaneous food intake in overweight and obese female . Hence, the use of alginate
  to address the features important in the development of overweight and obesity is
  therefore shown to be clinically effective. Furthermore, insoluble fiber such as
  cellulose, xylans, mannans are associated with excretion of bile acids, increase
  fecal bulk and decrease intestinal transit time . Previous studies have also suggested
  that seaweed polysaccharides may be used at fat substitute in a range of food applications
  in order to produce an end-product with reduced total fat content, while still allowing
  for a product with improved moisture retention and consistency. The use of seaweed
  polysaccharides has been shown to facilitate the production of low fat versions
  of meat-based, starch-based, fat-based and fruit/vegetable-based products .





  Maeda et al. reported that dietary intake of fucoxanthin significantly attenuates
  the weight gain of white adipose tissue and expressed Uncoupling Protein 1 in diabetic/obese
  KKA y female mice . The potential involvement of fucoxanthin in attenuate the weight
  gain of WAT may correlate to the presence of unusual double allenic bonds at C-7′
  position . WAT is the predominant type of adipose tissue and commonly calles “fat”
  in mammals . Besides its role in energy storage, WAT is now recognized as an endocrine
  and active secretory organ through its production of biologically active mediators
  termed, adipokines . Excess production of adipokines includes proinflammatory factors
  and chemokines, has been linked with obesity and plays an important role in the
  development of obesity related disease. Therefore, fucoxanthin activity to attenuate
  the weight gain of WAT in female mice demonstrated potential of fucoxanthin for
  the prevention and treatment of obesity and diabetes particularly in female subject.
  Dioxinodehydroeckol and 1-(3′,5′-dihydroxyphenoxy)-7-(2″,4″,6-trihydroxyphenoxy)-2,4,9-trihydroxydibenzo-1,4-dioxin,
  two phloroglucinol derivatives isolated from E. cava have significantly inhibits
  adipocyte differentiation in 3T3-L1 cells suggesting its potential use as a functional
  ingredient in obesity managements .


  Seaweeds may serve as a potential candidate of functional foodstuffs for obesity
  management. Hence, negative effect in female subject particularly to prevent cancer
  can be minimized by the application of seaweeds and seaweeds-derived bioactive materials
  in functional foods, nutraceuticals and pharmaceuticals. Additionally, seaweeds
  may develop as a new approach for the treatment of obesity in addition to currently
  available anti-obesity agents. Therefore, seaweeds would be a potent natural source
  for the development of foods and pharmaceuticals for the cancer prevention in female
  subject.




  The wide range of biological activities associated with bioactive materials derived
  from seaweeds such as phlorotannins , alginates, sulfated polysaccharides and carotenoids
  have potential to expand its nutritional and health beneficial value of seaweeds
  in food industries. Seaweed and seaweed-derived bioactive materials enrichment not
  only benefit the nutritional value of a food product, but also benefit the product
  in terms of improving the shelf-life and in some cases actually improving the sensorial
  properties. Furthermore, the wide diversity of seaweeds and numerous undiscovered
  unique metabolites present in seaweeds are interesting sources to increase numbers
  of novel functional foods which beneficial for cancer in female subjects. Accordingly,
  possibilities of designing new medicinal foods or nutraceuticals and pharmaceuticals
  for cancer prevention derived from seaweeds are promising. As such, nutrition or
  health researchers should collaborate early on with food technologists/food industry
  in order to design and develop suitably appealing products with these ingredients.
  Although side effects of seaweed and seaweed-derived functional ingredients have
  been limited in chronic animal and short-term clinical studies, sustained clinical
  trials are needed to establish the safety of seaweeds at anticancer doses.
