  activities—ranging from anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antibacterial, antihypertensive
  to hypoglycemic effects. This review article focuses on the role of honey in modulating
  the development and progression of tumors or cancers. It reviews available evidence
  with regards to the antimetastatic, antiproliferative and anticancer effects of
  honey in various forms of cancer. These effects of honey have been thoroughly investigated
  in certain cancers such as breast, liver and colorectal cancer cell lines. In contrast,
  limited but promising data are available for other forms of cancers including prostate,
  bladder, endometrial, kidney, skin, cervical, oral and bone cancer cells. The article
  also underscores the various possible mechanisms by which honey may inhibit growth
  and proliferation of tumors or cancers. These include regulation of cell cycle,
  activation of mitochondrial pathway, induction of mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization,
  induction of apoptosis, modulation of oxidative stress, amelioration of inflammation,
  modulation of insulin signaling and inhibition of angiogenesis. Honey is highly
  cytotoxic against tumor or cancer cells while it is non-cytotoxic to normal cells.
  The data indicate that honey can inhibit carcinogenesis by modulating the molecular
  processes of initiation, promotion, and progression stages. Thus, it may serve as
  a potential and promising anticancer agent which warrants further experimental and
  clinical studies. \n\n\n\n\n\nCancer refers to an unrestrained growth of cells which
  may exhibit malignant behavior. It is one of the leading causes of death worldwide
  . The most recent global incidence of cancer was estimated at 28.8 million in 2008
  . This rising prevalence is driven by certain factors, such as the adoption of a
  Western lifestyle in several developing countries, ageing populations, increased
  awareness and improved screenings and diagnosis of cancers . Out of the 7.6 million
  cancer deaths recorded in 2008, 2.9 and 4.7 million deaths occurred in economically
  developed and economically developing countries, respectively . The impact of this
  disease is more visible in developing countries. Several environmental factors such
  as smoking, physical inactivity, infections and diseases including obesity and diabetes
  are key risk factors for cancer . The process of cancer development comprises three
  key stages: initiation, promotion, and progression. Initiation, which is the first
  stage of carcinogenesis, involves irreversible genetic damage and is characterized
  by accumulation of mutated DNA . This is followed by promotion stage which is the
  proliferation of mutated cells. It is characterized by excessive growth of mutated
  cells and additional genomic alterations of the replicated cells giving rise to
  a benign mass of abnormal cells known as a tumor . Then the progression stage which
  entails metastasis of cancer cells to distant sites through the lymphatic or circulatory
  systems . Besides the limitations of current cancer management, available cytotoxic
  drugs are not easily affordable and available in some places, and their use is also
  associated with a number of undesirable side and adverse effects . As a consequence,
  a large proportion of the population prefers to patronize complementary and alternative
  medicine. Even though CAM has its own limitations, it does however have a number
  of advantages compared to the synthetic or standard drugs . The increased public
  interest in the utilization of CAM can be linked to the increased research data
  which attribute some health benefits to CAM.\n\nGenerally, CAM refers to diverse
  treatment approaches that are not an integral part of standard medicine and may
  include dietary components, supplements, herbal preparations, naturally-derived
  products and even lifestyle changes . There has been an increased awareness and
  use of CAM among cancer patients . One of such products that have become an important
  component of CAM is honey, a natural substance formed from nectar by honeybees.
  Honey exerts several biological activities such as antibacterial, hepatoprotective,
  anti-inflammatory, hypoglycemic, antioxidant and antihypertensive effects . Besides
  its sugar content, honey consists of several biologically active constituents such
  as flavonoids and phenolic compounds, vitamins, trace elements, amino acids and
  proteins as well as certain enzymes including glucose oxidase, invertase and catalase
  . Even though the use of honey dates back to ancient times, the last decade has
  witnessed an astronomical increase in the amount of research investigating the role
  of honey in the treatment of various diseases, including cancer. These health benefits
  of honey in treating diverse diseases can be attributed to its various pharmacologically
  active constituents, especially flavonoids and phenolic constituents. Some of the
  flavonoids and phenolic compounds that have been identified in honey include chrysin,
  kaempferol, quercetin, pinobanksin, pinocembrin, luteolin, apigenin, genistein,
  naringenin, hesperetin, p-coumaric acid, gallic acid, ellagic acid, ferulic acid,
  syringic acid, caffeic acid and vanillic acid . These honey constituents have been
  shown to exert anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antiproliferative, antitumor, antimetastatic
  and anticancer effects . The inhibitory effect of honey on tumorigenesis and cancerogenesis
  can therefore be attributed to the presence of these flavonoids and phenolic acids.
  This review article highlights the role of honey in modulating the development and
  progression of tumor or cancer as well as various possible mechanisms by which honey
  may inhibit growth of cancer. Findings on the antimetastatic, antiproliferative
  and anticancer effects of honey in various forms of cancer such as breast and colorectal
  cancer are discussed. In contrast, limited but promising data are available for
  other forms of cancers including prostate, bladder, endometrial, skin, cervical,
  oral and bone cancer cells. While honey is selectively toxic to tumor or cancer
  cells, it is non-cytotoxic to normal cells. Hence, honey may be used as a cancer
  therapeutic agent or to complement conventional cancer treatments.\n\n\n\nFlavonoids
  refer to a group of biologically active natural products with a 15-carbon structure,
  comprising two benzene rings joined by a heterocyclic pyrane ring . They are generally
  classified as flavonols, flavones, flavanones, isoflavones and anthocyanidins .
  Some flavonoids such as chrysin, genistein, naringenin and luteolin have been shown
  to exhibit estrogenic activity and are often referred to as phytoestrogens . The
  chemical structures of some of the major flavonoids present in many varieties of
  honey are shown in Figure 1. Figure 2 shows the chemical structure of 17-β-estradiol
  revealing its similarity to that of the flavonoids. The chemical structures of some
  of the phenolic acids in honey are shown in Figure 3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere
  has been an increase in the number of studies investigating the potential role of
  honey in the prevention of tumor or cancer development and progression. Most of
  these researches utilize in vitro techniques, while a scarcity of studies employ
  in vivo models. These effects of honey on the development or progression of tumors
  or cancers are highlighted according to the type of tumor or cancer in the following
  subsections.\n\n\n\nBreast cancer is the major cause of cancer deaths among women
  globally. It is estimated that about 12% of women will develop breast cancer in
  their lifetime . Besides several other factors, the circulating levels of estrogens
  and dysregulated estrogen signaling pathways play a predominant role in the development
  and progression of breast cancer . As a result, breast cancer therapy often targets
  the estrogen receptor-signaling pathway. There have been some attempts to investigate
  if honey could modulate this important pathway. Tsiapara and colleagues evaluated
  the potential of Greek thyme, pine and fir honey extracts to modulate the estrogenic
  activity and cell viability of breast cancer cells . The authors found that the
  honey samples exhibited a biphasic activity in MCF-7 cells depending on the concentration—an
  antiestrogenic effect at low concentrations and an estrogenic effect at high concentrations.
  In the presence of estradiol, thyme and pine honey extracts were found to antagonize
  estrogen activity, while fir honey extract enhanced estrogen activity in MCF-7 cells.
  The study also reported variations on the effects of the three honey extracts on
  cell viability. While the study found no effect of thyme and pine honey on MCF-7
  cells, ﬁr honey enhanced the viability of MCF-7 cells. These dual effects of honey
  extracts are mostly likely due to their high contents of phenolic compounds such
  as kaempferol and quercetin. Phenolic compounds are phytoestrogens which exert dual
  actions—both inhibitory and stimulatory effects . Phytoestrogens are phytochemicals
  which are structurally similar to mammalian estrogens and therefore can bind to
  estrogen receptors . They can elicit estrogenic or antiestrogenic effect depending
  on certain factors such as its concentration . Quercetin has been reported to elicit
  apoptotic effects through ER α- and ER β-dependent mechanisms . It is unclear why
  only ﬁr honey but not thyme and pine honey enhanced the viability of MCF-7 cells.
  Further studies may reveal differences in the composition of these honey samples.
  It is possible that ﬁr honey contain greater amounts of nutrients such as phenolic
  compounds, amino acids, vitamins, minerals and enzymes especially glucose oxidase
  which generate moderate levels of ROS. All this may enhance the viability of MCF-7
  cells.\n\nThe cytotoxic effect of tualang honey has also been demonstrated in the
  human breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 . The cytotoxicity was evident
  by increased leakage of lactate dehydrogenase from the cell membranes. Tualang honey
  was shown to induce apoptosis and reduce mitochondrial membrane potential. The authors
  also found that honey exerted no cytotoxic effect in MCF-10A, a normal breast cell
  line. This therefore suggests that the cytotoxic effect of tualang honey is specific
  and selective to the breast cancer cell lines. This is important because selectivity
  and specificity are key characteristics of a good chemotherapeutic agent. Unfortunately,
  most anticancer drugs lack these properties. These findings have been recently confirmed
  in another study which compared the effect of tualang honey with that of tamoxifen
  in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231. In addition to corroborating the previous findings , the
  study found that the anti-cancer effect of tualang honey on breast cancer cells
  was similar to that of tamoxifen . Cytotoxic effects on breast cancer cells have
  also been reported for Indian honey . These studies reveal that honey is able to
  exert cytotoxicity in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 which are ER-positive and ER-negative
  breast cancer cells, respectively. This can be attributed to the flavonoids and
  phenolic compounds in honey. These constituents which are phytoestrogens have been
  shown to stimulate both ER-α and –β subtypes .\n\nSeveral studies have also confirmed
  the antimetastic, antiproliferative and anticancer effects of honey on breast tumor
  or cancer in rodents. In a murine tumor model, the anti-metastatic effect of honey
  when applied before tumor-cell inoculation has been reported . The antimetastatic
  effect of honey may be due to its flavonoids such chrysin which have been shown
  to inhibit the metastatic potential of human breast cancer cells . Similarly, a
  study investigated the antitumor effect of two honey samples containing different
  phenolic contents against Ehrlich ascites and solid carcinoma. Both honeys were
  found to markedly inhibit the growth of Ehrlich ascites carcinoma, but the honey
  containing higher phenolic content exerted a greater antitumor effect . Research
  carried out by Tomasin and Gomes-Marcondes investigated the effects of combined
  Aloe vera and honey on tumor growth and cell proliferation against Walker 256 carcinoma
  implant in Wistar rats. Both agents were found to suppress tumor growth and inhibit
  cell proliferation .\n\nIn a recent study, Abd Kadir and colleagues investigated
  the inhibitory effect of Malaysian tualang honey on the development of 7,12-dimethylbenz(α)anthracene-induced
  breast cancer in rats. The researchers found that the untreated DMBA-induced breast
  cancer rats showed tumor development much earlier than the honey-treated DMBA-induced
  breast cancer rats. The control rats also showed marked increase of tumor size over
  a shorter period of time. In contrast, the size increment and tumor size were markedly
  reduced in honey-treated DMBA-induced breast cancer rats compared to the untreated
  cancer rats. The authors also found that the honey-treated cancer rats had fewer
  numbers of tumors than the controls. Though not statistically significant, increasing
  the dose of honey tended towards increased apoptotic index. While most of the honey-treated
  cancer rats developed low or medium grade tumor, the untreated rats had mostly high
  grade tumors. The histological analysis also revealed that the cancer cells from
  the honey-treated rats were more identical, with denser nuclei, while those of the
  control rats had more pleomorphic cells with more prominent nuclei. Other findings
  include less prominent vasculature around the tumor nodules and significantly reduced
  weights and volumes of the tumor masses in honey-treated rats .\n\nThese data suggest
  that honey exhibits anticancer effect as evident by its antiestrogen activity and
  potential in inducing mitochondrial membrane depolarization and apoptosis in breast
  cancer cells. The antiproliferative and antimetastatic effects of honey are also
  demonstrated by its ability to suppress tumorigenesis and reduce size and number
  of tumors in DMBA-induced breast cancer in rats. The data also support previous
  observations that the biological or pharmacological effects of honey may vary among
  honey samples and dose-dependent. Additional data, especially emanating from in
  vivo studies, are necessary to support or strengthen the anticancer effect of honey
  in breast cancer.\n\n\n\nLike other cancers, the prevalence of liver cancer is on
  the rise. A 2005 report estimated that 82% of liver cancer cases occurred in developing
  countries . Hepatocellular carcinoma is the most predominant liver cancer. The increased
  incidence of HCC is linked to various factors, mainly infection with hepatitis B
  or hepatitis C virus, as well as diabetes, obesity, hereditary and social risk factors
  such as excessive consumption of alcohol . In spite of considerable advances in
  the treatment of HCC, the quality of life among patients remains very poor. This
  suggests the need to continuously strive for better therapies. The antitumor effects
  of honey on liver cancer cells have recently been reported in a number of studies.
  Hassan et al. demonstrated that treatment of human hepatocellular carcinoma cells
  with honey markedly reduced the number of viable HepG2 cells and nitric oxide levels,
  while it enhanced the total antioxidant status . Based on these findings, it can
  be speculated that the viability or survival of HepG2 cells is sustained by reactive
  oxygen species. Moderate levels of ROS enhance cell proliferation, growth and differentiation
  . The reduced levels of NO following honey treatment lend credence to this view.
  By scavenging ROS, honey will invariably enhance TAS as shown in this study. Hence,
  decreased ROS and improved antioxidant defenses will consequently lead to inhibition
  of proliferation as evidenced by the reduced number of viable HepG2 cells. A study
  that investigated the antiproliferative effects of gelam honey on HepG2 found that
  the IC50 value of gelam honey towards HepG2 was 25% whereas it was 70% for normal
  human hepatocytes . This shows gelam honey is selectively cytototoxic to liver cancer
  cells. The study also revealed that gelam honey inhibited the proliferation of HepG2
  cells and induced apoptosis in HepG2. A similar study evaluated the antiproliferative
  effect of a mixture of gelam honey and Tinospora crispa on HepG2 and WRL-68 cells
  . The study reported an IC50 value of 42.67% in HepG2 cells and none in the WRL-68
  cells. The mixture was also found to induce apoptosis in HepG2 cells. Antiproliferative
  effect of Thailand pot-honey on HepG2 cells has also been demonstrated .\n\nA study
  by Abdel Aziz and colleagues investigated the effects of honey extracts on HepG2
  cell lines . The authors reported that honey extracts exerted cytotoxic, antimetastatic
  and anti-angiogenic effects in HepG2 cells. These effects were found to vary with
  different degrees based on the honey quality while some honey samples with poor
  quality did not produce cytotoxic effect. Some of the honey extracts were also found
  to enhance proliferation of cancer cells—an effect that may be due to the nutrients
  such as amino acids, minerals, vitamins and antioxidants in honey. Availability
  of such nutrients may serve as substrate for cellular metabolism in HepG2 cells.
  The proliferative effect of honey may also be due to hydrogen peroxide generated
  by honey. Peroxide-producing honey has been reported to liberate radicals . Several
  factors may influence the amount of ROS generated by honey. For instance, honey
  samples that contain higher amounts of the enzyme glucose oxidase may produce more
  ROS. Similarly, the duration and techniques of storage may also influence the level
  of ROS formed. Though the concentrations may be small, such small amounts of ROS
  may stimulate cancer cell proliferation. While this potential proliferative effect
  may likely be suppressed in honey rich in phenolic compounds, it may be augmented
  in honey with low phenolic compounds. This may explain the variations of the anticancer
  properties of the different honey extracts. Findings from Hanaa and Shaymaa’s study
  also confirmed the antitumor effect of honey in HepG2 cells . A recent study investigated
  the protective effect of three honey samples of diverse floral origin on mutagens-induced
  DNA strand breaks in a HepG2 cell line . The study utilized N-nitrosopyrrolidine,
  N-nitrosodimethylamine, benzo(a)pyrene and 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenyl-imidazopyridine
  as dietary mutagens. The results showed that honey samples protected against DNA
  damage induced by NPYR, BaP and PhIP but not NDMA, whereas artificial honey exerted
  no such protective effect. The study found an association between high phenolic
  content and protection of HepG2 against mutagens-induced DNA damage. The protective
  effect of honey against mutagens-induced DNA damage in HepG2 can be attributed to
  its antioxidant and free radical scavenging properties.\n\nThere are limited data
  on the potential inhibitory effects of honey on hepatic tumorigenesis or carcinogenesis
  in vivo. A recent study investigated the effect of honey on the development and
  progression of diethylnitrosamine-induced hepatic cancer in rats . After treatment
  for six months, the liver of untreated DEN-injected rats showed a variety of lesions
  including inflammatory lymphocytic infiltration, fatty degeneration with displacement
  of the nucleus, oedema and injured hepatocytes with hyperchromatic nuclei. The liver
  of DEN-injected rats also showed the presence of neoplastic hepatic cells which
  were polyhedral to round with dense vesicular nuclei. Several strong positive stained
  nuclei for p53 and PCNA expressions were also observed in the liver of untreated
  DEN-injected rats. These abnormalities including neoplastic hepatic cells, stained
  nuclei for p53 and PCNA expressions were considerably reduced in the liver of honey-treated
  DEN-induced rats. These findings suggest that honey has an anticancer effect on
  liver cancer cells and exerts a protective effect against chemical-induced hepatocarcinogenesis
  in rats.\n\n\n\nColorectal cancer accounts for about 9% of all cancer cases . It
  is the third commonest cancer in the World and the fourth most frequent cause of
  death . Environmental factors have been identified to play a predominant role in
  the pathophysiology of colorectal cancer . In spite of advances in its treatment,
  including postoperative care, recurrence and mortality rates remain high , hence
  the urgent need to complement the current therapies. A study that investigated the
  chemopreventive effects of gelam and nenas monofloral honeys against colon cancer
  cell lines found that the honey samples inhibited proliferation of colon cancer
  cells. Both honeys also caused DNA damage in a dose dependent manner and suppressed
  inflammation in H2O2 inflammation-induced colon cancer cells . In a recent study,
  Jaganathan and Mandal investigated the apoptotic effect of some crude honey samples
  in colon cancer cell lines, HCT 15 and HT 29. The study confirmed the antiproliferative
  effect of honey in colon cancer cells as previously reported and also revealed that
  this effect was dependent on the level of phenolic content. The higher the phenolic
  content, the greater the antiproliferative effect against colon cancer cells . In
  addition to its antiproliferative effect, honey also induced apoptosis by causing
  the depletion of intracellular non-protein thiols. It also reduced the mitochondrial
  membrane potential and increased generation of ROS . Findings from in vivo studies
  have also demonstrated the anticancer effect of honey. Studies by Orsolić et al.
  showed that honey, when applied before tumor-cell inoculation, exerted anti-metastatic
  effect in a murine tumor model with colon carcinoma . This suggests that the mice
  are better protected against tumor development when honey is administered before
  tumor-cell inoculation. In other words, the anti-metastatic effect of honey in this
  murine tumor model is prophylactic. These findings deserve to be investigated further
  especially using other tumor models. Similarly, the antimetastatic effect of honey
  has been demonstrated in anaplastic colon adenocarcinoma of Y59 rats . Other studies
  have also confirmed the protective effect of honey against methylnitrosourea-induced
  colon adenocarcinoma in rats .\n\n\n\nA study that investigated the bioactivity
  of three Greek honeys on prostate cancer cells found marked differences in the effects
  of honeys on cell viability . The study showed that only thyme honey reduced considerably
  the viability of PC-3 cells while no such effect was found for pine and fir honey
  extracts. Iranian honey has also been shown to induce apoptosis and inhibit proliferation
  of PC-3 cells . These findings suggest that honey exerts antiproliferative effect
  on prostate cancer cells. The data also reveal that not all honey samples exhibit
  antiproliferative effect. This seems to support previous findings that the effect
  of honey on cell proliferation is dependent on the concentration of honey as well
  as the cancer cell line.\n\n\n\nSwellam and colleague reported that honey markedly
  inhibited the proliferation of three human bladder cancer cell lines—T24, 253J and
  RT4, as well as one murine bladder cancer cell line, MBT-2 . The authors also investigated
  the in vivo effect of honey on bladder cancer cells implanted subcutaneously in
  the abdomens of mice. It was shown that administration of 6% and 12% honey via intralesional
  and oral routes significantly inhibited tumor growth. Honey has also been reported
  to inhibit cell proliferation, induce apoptosis, alter cell cycle progression and
  cause mitochondrial membrane depolarization in many other forms of cancer including
  endometrial cancer cells , renal cell carcinoma , skin cancer cells , cervical cancer
  cell lines , human non-small cell lung cancer cells , mouth cancer cells and bone
  cancer cells . In a recently published article, Morales and Haza investigated the
  antiproliferative and apoptotic effects of three crude Spanish honey samples of
  different floral origin and those of an artificial honey in HL-60, a human peripheral
  blood promyelocytic leukemia cell line . The researchers reported that all the three
  honey samples induced apoptosis, in a concentration and time dependent-manner. The
  apoptotic effect of the honey samples was also found to be dependent on the levels
  of their phenolic content. The antimetastic effect of honey has also been demonstrated
  in mice with transplantable tumors . A study reported a positive effect of honey
  ingestion on gastric cancer via induction of apoptosis in gastric mucosa . The summary
  of the effects of honey on the development and progression of tumor and cancer is
  presented in Table 1. The table shows the type of cancer or tumor in which the effects
  of honey have been investigated. It also reveals the key findings on the effects
  of honey on these tumor or cancer cells.  \n\n\n\n\nSome of the mechanisms by which
  honey may exert its antiproliferative, antimetastatic and anticancer effects are
  discussed in this section. These include, but are not limited to cell cycle arrest,
  activation of mitochondrial pathway, induction of mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization,
  induction of apoptosis, modulation of oxidative stress, amelioration of inflammation,
  modulation of insulin signaling, and inhibition of angiogenesis.\n\n\n\nCell cycle
  is a series of coordinated events in which cell growth and proliferation are tightly
  controlled. It comprises four sequential phases—G1, S, G2 and M. DNA replication
  takes place at the S phase while the cell divides into two identical daughter cells
  at the M phase . The G1 and G2 are the gap phases between S and M. At the G1 phase,
  the cells are responsive to extracellular signals by progressing towards mitosis
  or withdrawal from the cell cycle into a quiescent stage known as G0. The regulation
  of the cell cycle events is under the control of a cascade of protein kinases and
  checkpoints . In cancer cells, the cell cycle becomes dysregulated and this results
  in uncontrolled cell proliferation. Using various cancer cell lines, honey has been
  documented to induce cell cycle arrest. Honey treatment of bladder cancer cell lines
  was shown to cause a considerable arrest of cell cycle in the sub-G1 phase . Recently,
  Aliyu and colleagues also showed that the cytotoxic effect of honey against non-small
  cell lung cancer cell was mediated via arrest of cell cycle at G0/G1 phase . Available
  data reveal that the ability of honey to arrest cell cycle is due to the various
  flavonoids and phenolic compounds in honey. In one of such studies, Pichichero et
  al.  found both honey and its constituent chrysin exerted antiproliferative effects
  in human and murine melanoma cells via cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase. Besides
  chrysin, several other phenolics such as quercetin and kaempferol which are found
  in large quantities in honey have also been shown to arrest cell cycle at various
  phases such as G0/G1, G1 and G2/M in human melanoma, renal, cervical, hepatoma,
  colon and oesophageal adenocarcinoma cell lines .\n\n\n\nOne of the mechanisms by
  which chemotherapy and radiotherapy cause cancer cell death is the activation of
  the mitochondrial pathway . Mitochondrial membrane permeabilization is an early
  event in the mitochondrial pathway, also known as intrinsic pathway. The mitochondrial
  pathway involves a series of interactions between several stimuli including nutrients,
  physical stresses, oxidative stress and damage , during which several proteins usually
  located in the intermembrane mitochondria space become released resulting in cell
  death . Therefore, compounds or agents such as honey rich in flavonoids that are
  capable of activating mitochondrial pathway and release of proteins such as cytochrome
  C are considered potential cytotoxic agents .\n\n\n\nThe induction of mitochondrial
  outer membrane permeabilization leads to leakage of intermembrane space proteins
  into the cytosol and consequently causing cell death . Induction of MOMP is a common
  mechanism of agents with anticancer properties. Honey induces mitochondrial membrane
  permeabilization in various cancer cell lines via reduction of the mitochondrial
  membrane potential . Honey has also been found to augment the apoptotic effect of
  tamoxifen via increased depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane . Similarly,
  a study by Jaganathan and Mandal found that reduction of mitochondrial membrane
  potential is an important mechanism of the cytotoxicity of Indian honey in HCT-15
  and HT-29 colon cancer cells . Flavonoids such as quercetin have been shown to cause
  MOMP . Therefore, it can be inferred that cancer cell death induced via MOMP by
  honey is mediated partly through its flavonoid constituents.\n\n\n\nApoptosis is
  a programmed cell death which helps to regulate cell growth and eliminate damaged
  cells . Several apoptotic pathways are deregulated in cancer cells and this favors
  their survival and immortality . The apoptotic pathway involves MOMP which leads
  to the release of IMS pro-apoptotic proteins such as cytochrome c which in turn
  activate caspase cascade resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death .
  Treatment of cancer cells with honey was shown to cause apoptotic cell death in
  breast cancer cells via induction of caspase-3/7 and -9 activation . Honey was also
  recently reported to enhance tamoxifen-induced apoptosis by activating caspase-3/7,
  -8 and -9 . The effect of honey has also been demonstrated on several enzymes, genes
  and transcription factors related to apoptosis. Colorectal cancer cell lines HCT-15
  and HT-29 treated with honey showed down-regulation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase
  expression . The PARP is an enzyme that plays a vital role in apoptosis and DNA
  repair . The inhibition of PARP activity by honey will prevent DNA repair and thereby
  contribute to increased cytotoxicity of honey in cancer cells. The study further
  revealed that honey treatment induced or activated caspase-3, p53 and Bax expression
  while it down-regulated Bcl2 expression. Honey has also been shown to exert anti-mutagenic
  effect by inhibiting error-prone repair pathway .\n\nThe p53, also known as tumor
  suppressor p53, is an important transcription factor regularly inactivated in many
  forms of human tumors . It mediates tumor suppression by modulating the transcription
  of many genes involved in the regulation of apoptosis . Honey treatment in diethylnitrosamine-induced
  carcinogenic rats was reported to be associated with nearly normal hepatocytes and
  few neoplastic cells whereas the untreated carcinogenic rats were characterized
  by severely injured hepatocytes, several neoplastic cells and up-regulated p53 expression
  . The study showed that the antineoplastic effect of honey was mediated via restoration
  of p53 expression. Tomasin et al. who evaluated the effect of honey and Aloe vera
  on apoptosis in rats with Walker 256 carcinoma reported that tumors from rats treated
  with honey and Aloe vera had markedly higher Bax/Bcl-2 ratio . Similarly, Fernandez-Cabezudo
  and colleagues demonstrated the apoptotic effect of honey on human breast cancer,
  murine melanoma and colorectal carcinoma cells. The apoptotic effect of honey was
  found to be mediated via the activation of caspase 9, caspase 3 and down-regulated
  Bcl-2 expression . The apoptotic effect of honey is most likely due to its phenolics.
  Quercetin has been reported to inhibit pancreatic and breast cancer cell growth
  and induce apoptosis via Bcl-2 expression downregulation and upregulation of Bax
  expression . Recent evidence reveals that chrysin, a key constituent of honey, exerts
  antimetastatic effect in human breast cancer cells . Similarly, chrysin was shown
  to induce apoptosis through caspase-3 and Bax activation in B16-F1 and A375 melanoma
  cells . The Bcl-2 is an anti-apoptotic protein commonly over-expressed in many forms
  of cancers . On the other hand, Bax is a pro-apoptotic protein. Cancer cells generally
  have characteristic deregulated or impaired apoptosis resulting from down-regulation
  of pro-apoptotic proteins and/or up-regulation of anti-apoptotic proteins . Hence,
  these findings reveal that honey induces cancer cell death or apoptosis via activation
  of caspase cascade, induction of p53 and up-regulation of pro-apoptotic proteins—Bax
  and down-regulation of anti-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2. The data also point
  to the role of honey flavonoids in the apoptotic effect of honey in cancer cells.\n\n\n\nThe
  role of reactive oxygen species and oxidative stress in cancer growth and inhibition
  still remains controversial. There is evidence in support of dual roles of ROS in
  cancer. Low levels of ROS enhance proliferation of cells . On the other hand, increased
  levels of ROS which cause oxidative damage are well documented in many forms of
  cancer such as colorectal cancer , breast cancer , lung cancer  and gastric cancer
  . Therefore, the maintenance of redox homeostasis is important for normal cell growth
  and proliferation. Considering that ROS are double-edged sword, available evidence
  also suggests that selective exposure of cancer cells to increased levels of ROS
  and/or lipid peroxidation products may result in cancer cell death . Honey is a
  potent antioxidant and free radical scavengers . Several of its biological effects
  are attributed to its antioxidant properties . Therefore, the inhibitory effect
  of honey on cancer growth and proliferation may be mediated partly via its modulation
  of oxidative stress.\n\nData from Hassan and colleagues’ study indicated that the
  anti-neoplastic effects of honey and Nigella sativa on hepatocellular carcinoma
  cells were associated with improved antioxidant status . On the other hand, Jaganathan
  and Mandal showed that anticancer effect of honey is mediated via increased oxidative
  stress. The researchers reported that honey treatment caused non-protein thiol depletion
  in HCT-15 and HT-29 colon cancer cells. The antiproliferative effect of honey was
  also shown to be associated with increased generation of ROS. Honey-induced cell
  death was accompanied by DNA fragmentation, which was markedly inhibited by treatment
  with antioxidant, N-acetyl-L-cysteine . By and large, these findings indicate honey
  can inhibit cancer growth by modulating oxidative stress—that is, via amelioration
  or induction of oxidative stress. Whether honey exerts anticancer effect via antioxidant
  or pro-oxidant mechanism seems to largely depend on the oxidative stress status
  in the cancer cells. If survival of cancer cells is dependent on low level of ROS
  and oxidative stress, honey may act as a pro-oxidant to generate more ROS and increase
  oxidative stress. On the other hand, if cancer growth is sustained or enhanced by
  elevated levels of ROS and oxidative stress, honey acts as an antioxidant by scavenging
  ROS and reducing oxidative stress. In both cases, pro-oxidant and antioxidant effects
  of honey invariably result in cancer cell death. These dual effects of honey in
  cancer cells are mostly likely due to its phenolic constituents. Besides their antioxidant
  properties, phenolic compounds are easily oxidizeable. Beverages which have high
  concentrations of polyphenols and strong antioxidant properties have been reported
  to generate high H2O2 levels upon exposure to air . Besides, following their interactions
  with transition metal ions such as copper, honey phenolic compounds may liberate
  ROS causing ROS-mediated DNA damage and resulting in cell death . Several flavonoids
  and phenolics have been demonstrated to induce ROS in cancer cells . However, a
  recent study revealed that while the concentrations of phenolic compounds play a
  key role in honey-induced HL-60 cell death, honey did not generate ROS and NAC did
  not prevent honey-induced cancer cell death . This suggests that in spite of its
  high phenolic content, honey can still exert its anticancer effect via ROS-independent
  mechanism(s).\n\n\n\nChronic inflammatory disorders are associated with increased
  risk of cancer. The development of inflammatory-related/induced cancers usually
  occurs within the vicinity of the affected cells or tissues. Colorectal cancer,
  for example, may develop from ulcerative colitis or inflammatory bowel diseases
  . Infection caused by schistosomes and other parasites may predispose the individual
  to bladder cancers . Likewise oral infections such as caused by human papillomavirus
  may lead to oropharyngeal cancer . Inflammation is also an important factor in the
  pathophysiology of many other cancers/malignancies . Two important components of
  the inflammatory pathway frequently activated in cancers are mitogen-activated protein
  kinase and nuclear factor kappa B pathways . Activation of MAPK and/or NF-κB, subsequently
  results in induction of several inflammatory proteins and genes including cyclooxygenase-2,
  C-reactive protein, lipoxygenase-2, and pro-inflammatory mediators or cytokines
  such as interleukin 1, IL-6 and TNF-α. All these pathways and pro-inflammatory mediators
  are known to play an important role in angiogenesis and inflammatory related etiology
  of cancer . Diverse biological processes and events that enhance inflammation can
  contribute to tumorigenesis because chronic inflammation is a key driver of promotion,
  the second stage of cancer development. On the other hand, biological processes
  and activities that decrease inflammation will not only hinder or limit the promotion
  stage but also prevent the transition of this stage to progression stage. In other
  words, amelioration of inflammation can help to prevent both the formation of a
  benign tumor and its progression to malignant cancer. Hence, several researchers
  are paying more attention to the prospect of treating cancer by targeting inflammation
  .\n\nBatumalaie et al. recently showed the honey treatment reduced the expression
  of MAPK and NF-κB in HIT-T15 cells . Chrysin, commonly found in honey, has also
  been shown to induce apoptosis via modulation of MAPK in B16-F1 and A375 melanoma
  cells . A study investigated the effect of honey flavonoid extract on the production
  of pro-inflammatory mediators by lipopolysaccharide-stimulated N13 microglia. The
  data indicated that HFE markedly suppressed the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines
  including TNF-α and IL-1β . Chrysin was also shown to enhance TNF-related apoptosis-inducing
  ligand induced apoptosis in cancer cell lines . Honey also suppressed edema and
  leukocyte infiltration . Recently, evidence has also emerged from in vivo studies
  demonstrating the anti-inflammatory effect of honey. Hussein et al. evaluated the
  anti-inflammatory effect of honey in rats with carrageenan-induced inflammation
  . The study showed that honey decreased edema in a dose-dependent manner while it
  reduced the plasma levels of inflammatory mediators including IL-6, TNF-α, PGE2
  and NO. The authors also reported that honey administration inhibited the expression
  of IL-6, TNF-α, iNOS and COX-2 in paw tissue. The anti-inflammatory of honey was
  found to be comparable to that of indomethacin. In their latest findings, the researchers
  demonstrated that honey markedly attenuated NF-κB translocation to the nucleus and
  suppressed IκBα degradation . The cytotoxic effect of honey against non-small cell
  lung cancer cell was also reported to be partly mediated via modulation of inflammatory
  cytokines . These findings suggest the anti-inflammatory effect of honey, mediated
  via attenuation of pro-inflammatory mediators and inhibition of NF-κB and MAPK signaling
  pathways, may contribute considerably to the anticancer effect of honey. The anti-inflammatory
  effect of honey can be attributed to its phenolic compounds and flavonoids .\n\n\n\nEvidence
  from epidemiological studies indicates insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes mellitus
  and obesity are major risk factors for different types of tumors or malignancies
  . Research in the past few years has implicated the role of insulin receptor in
  cancerogenesis . Vincent et al. recently demonstrated that small molecule inhibitors
  that target both the IR and insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor are effective
  in reducing non-small cell lung cancer cell proliferation . Another key component
  of insulin signaling is the PI3K/Akt. The PI3K/Akt is known for its role in modulating
  the functions of several substrates that regulate cell survival, cell cycle progression
  and cellular growth . The effect of gelam honey extracts on Akt activated insulin
  signaling pathway in HIT-T15 cells under hyperglycemic conditions was recently investigated
  . The researchers reported that the development of insulin resistance was characterized
  by increased levels of MAPK, NF-κB, and insulin receptor substrate 1 serine phosphorylation
  while Akt expression and insulin contents were markedly reduced. The study showed
  that pretreatment with gelam honey and quercetin extracts improved insulin resistance
  and insulin content. Honey treatment increased the expression of Akt while it reduced
  the expression of IRS-1 serine phosphorylation, MAPK and NF-κB. These findings suggest
  that honey can modulate insulin signaling. Such an effect may contribute to its
  anticancer effect. Hence, similar studies are necessary in cancer cells.\n\n\n\nCancer
  cells generally are capable of penetrating blood or lymphatic vessels. They are
  circulated and later proliferate at adjacent or distant sites/organs, a process
  known as metastasis . Metastasis requires the growth of the vascular network which
  is necessary for the provision or delivery of oxygen, cellular metabolic substrates
  including nutrients and even blood containing the immune cells . This process of
  formation of new blood is known as angiogenesis. Angiogenesis is a key event in
  the development, growth, progression and metastasis of tumor/cancer . Recent research
  has focused on several angiogenic factors and their inhibitors in the treatment
  of cancer . Many studies have shown that honey has a debriding effect, promotes
  epithelization, enhances the growth of granulation tissue and promotes angiogenic
  activity in the vasculature . In non-cancer cells, honey may stimulate angiogenesis
  via generation of hydrogen peroxide . The angiogenic effect of honey is perhaps
  beneficial in wound healing. On the other hand, it is possible that honey inhibits
  angiogenesis in cancer cells. The potential anti-angiogenic effect of honey in cancer
  cells is premised on the evidence that honey inhibits cancer cell viability, metastasis
  and activities of gelatinase and protease. This is evident from a study by Abdel
  Aziz and colleagues who demonstrated that honey exerted anti-angiogenic effects
  in hepatocellular carcinoma HePG2 cell lines . Honey is also rich in polyphenols.
  Polyphenols from natural products such as red wine and green tea have been shown
  to exert anti-angiogenic and anticancer effects . Propolis is another bee product
  like honey. Propolis, like honey, has anticancer effects  and it has been shown
  to inhibit tumor-induced angiogenesis . Caffeic acid phenethyl ester, chrysin and
  other cytotoxic constituents of honey have been reported to exert anti-angiogenic
  and anticancer effects . These data therefore indicate that honey can exert it anticancer
  effect via inhibition of angiogenesis.\n\nHoney can inhibit the development of cancer
  by blocking the three main stages of cancerogenesis as shown in Figure 4. The various
  molecular mechanisms or targets by which honey can suppress cancer development are
  shown in Figure 5.\n\n\n\n\nHoney inhibits/suppresses the 3 stages of cancerogenesis
  at initiation , proliferation  and progression .\n\nFigure 5. Molecular mechanisms/targets
  mediating the antiproliferative, antitumor, antimetastatic and anticancer effects
  of honey. \n\n\nFigure 5. Molecular mechanisms/targets mediating the antiproliferative,
  antitumor, antimetastatic and anticancer effects of honey.\n\n\n\nHoney is a natural
  product that shows potential effects to inhibit or suppress the development and
  progression of tumor and cancer. Its antiproliferative, antitumor, antimetastic
  and anticancer effects are mediated via diverse mechanisms, including cell cycle
  arrest, activation of mitochondrial pathway, induction of mitochondrial outer membrane
  permeabilization, induction of apoptosis, modulation of oxidative stress, amelioration
  of inflammation, modulation of insulin signaling, and inhibition of angiogenesis
  in cancer cells. Honey is highly and selectively cytotoxic against tumor or cancer
  cells while it is non-cytotoxic to normal cells. It can inhibit cancerogenesis by
  modulating or interfering with the molecular processes or events of initiation,
  promotion, and progression stages. It, therefore, can be considered a potential
  and promising anticancer agent which warrants further research—both in experimental
  and clinical studies.\n\n\n\n"
