  Evidence suggests that berries contain bioactive compounds, which reduce certain
  cancers and hypertension. Our hypothesis was that daily blueberry consumption would
  increase natural killer cells and plasma redox capacity and reduce blood pressure,
  augmentation index, central pulse wave velocity, and aortic systolic pressures.
  Twenty-five men and postmenopausal women aged 18 to 50 years were recruited and
  randomized to BB or placebo groups. Participants were provided with BB or placebo
  powders each day for 6 weeks. Blood pressure, vascular performance testing, and
  blood samples were taken at baseline. Participants returned after 6 weeks and repeated
  all procedures. Presupplementation to postsupplementation comparisons for the main
  effects of treatment, time, and treatment-time interaction were made using a 2 Ã—
  2 repeated-measures analysis of variance for all vascular measures, redox status,
  and NK cell counts. Anthropometric measures were compared using t tests. Body mass,
  composition, and overall blood pressures were not affected in either group. Overall,
  AIx and ASPs were decreased in BB. Plasma redox was not affected. Absolute NK cells
  were increased in BB. Subjects with prehypertensive pressures were examined as a
  subset using t tests and exhibited significant reductions in diastolic pressure
  from presupplementation to postsupplementation in BB. We conclude that BB ingestion
  for 6 weeks increases NK cells and reduces AIx, ASP, and diastolic pressures in
  sedentary males and females.'
