  risk but this is still inconclusive. The aim of this study was to assess whether
  overall dietary antioxidant capacity, as assessed by dietary ferric reducing antioxidant
  potential, and individual dietary antioxidant intake were associated with breast
  cancer risk. Data was used from women participating in the Rotterdam Study, a prospective
  cohort study among subjects aged 55 years and older. FRAP scores and antioxidant
  intake was assessed at baseline by a food frequency questionnaire. Incident cases
  of breast cancer were confirmed through medical reports. During a median follow-up
  of 17 years, 199 cases with breast cancer were identified. High dietary FRAP score
  was associated with a lower risk of breast cancer . No overall association between
  individual antioxidant intake and breast cancer risk was found. However, low intake
  of alpha carotene and beta carotene was associated with a higher risk of breast
  cancer among smokers and low intake of flavonoids was associated with breast cancer
  risk in women over the age of 70. These results suggest that high overall dietary
  antioxidant capacity is associated with a lower risk of breast cancer. Individual
  effects of dietary carotenoids and dietary flavonoids may be restricted to subgroups
  such as smokers and elderly.\n\nThe incidence of breast cancer cases is increasing
  worldwide; predominantly in high-income countries. Worldwide, it has been estimated
  that 1.38 million new cases were diagnosed in 2008 which accounts for 23% of all
  diagnosed cancers among women.\n\nSeveral risk factors for breast cancer have been
  identified such as family history of breast cancer, reproductive history, the absence
  of breastfeeding, weight gain, moderate alcohol consumption and postmenopausal hormone
  therapy.\n\nDietary factors might also contribute to breast cancer prevention. For
  instance, experimental studies in vitro suggest that high antioxidant intake may
  reduce the risk of developing cancer. However, observational studies on antioxidant
  status and the risk of breast cancer show inconsistent results. In addition, case
  control studies have found that fruits and vegetable intake are associated with
  a reduced breast cancer risk which may be due to high intake of antioxidants. However,
  the European Prospective Investigation on Cancer did not find any prospective association
  between fruit and vegetable intake and breast cancer risk across Europe. In addition,
  the World Cancer Research Fund/American Institute for Cancer Research has concluded
  that the overall evidence for fruit, vegetables and antioxidants and breast cancer
  risk is still too limited.\n\nSo far, studies mainly focused on evaluating the contribution
  of individual factors to breast cancer risk and did not take into account the overall
  diet or the contribution of multiple elements to an overall antioxidant effect which
  may have contributed to the contradictory results.\n\nMeasuring the \"total antioxidant
  capacity of the diet\" is a challenge and different alternatives have been explored
  which show similar ranking of foods according to their antioxidant capacity. The
  ferric reducing antioxidant potential measures the antioxidant capacity of the diet
  by measuring the reduction of ferric ion to ferrous ion which can be a useful marker
  to capture overall effects of antioxidants according to dietary components instead
  of individual effects of foods or antioxidants. In addition, previous studies have
  suggested that iron can induce oxidative stress that may influence mammary carcinogenesis
  but whether a more complete measurement of the antioxidant capacity of the diet,
  as assessed by FRAP, would provide a more relevant effect in terms of prevention
  of breast cancer remains unclear. Therefore, the primary objective of our study
  was to assess whether FRAP was associated with the risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal
  women. A second aim was to assess whether individual dietary antioxidant intake
  was associated with breast cancer risk.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe present analyses were performed
  in the Rotterdam Study, a population-based prospective cohort study which has been
  described in detail previously. We used data from the first cohort of the Rotterdam
  Study which consists of 7,983 persons living in the Ommoord district in Rotterdam,
  The Netherlands. All subjects were above the age of 55 years and have been recruited
  between July 1989 and September 1993. The participants first underwent an interview
  at home and an extensive physical examination in the research center. These examinations
  were repeated every 3-4 years.\n\n\n\nDietary intake was evaluated at baseline examination
  by using a two step-protocol, in order to minimize the loss of information in dietary
  reporting in an older population. During the home interview, subjects were provided
  with a meal-based checklist to indicate the foods they had consumed at least twice
  per month in the previous year. Subsequently, a dietary interview was performed
  at the research center by using a validated semiquantitative food-frequency questionnaire.
  The SFFQ was designed to measure typical diet by asking questions about the frequency
  and amount of food consumption. It consisted of 170 food items. Frequency of food
  intake was recorded in times per day, week or month, and serving sizes were specified
  in standardized units, household measures, or grams. Data from the SFFQ were then
  analysed and transformed into macronutrient and antioxidant intake using the Dutch
  Food Composition Table.\n\nNutrient intake from the SFFQ was validated against a
  15 days food diary of food recording over a 1-year period. Pearson correlation after
  adjustment for age, sex, energy and within-person variation were between 0.44 and
  0.85 for macro and micronutrients as described in detail previously.\n\n\n\nTo assess
  dietary antioxidant capacity from the SFFQ, each foods contribution to FRAP was
  calculated on the basis of the Antioxidant Food Table published by the Institute
  of Nutrition Research, University of Oslo, which includes measurements of &gt;3,000
  foods. Based on a modified version of the FRAP assay to assess the antioxidant capacity
  of individual food items by measuring the ability of antioxidants in food items
  to reduce ferric iron to ferrous iron. Since this food table consisted of foods
  from several manufacturers, we consulted nutritional experts at Wageningen University
  to determine linkage of foods from several manufacturers that were the closest to
  the Dutch food products. For each participant, we multiplied the consumption frequency
  of each food by the corresponding FRAP value, and summed these values across all
  dietary sources. Detailed data on vitamin supplementation was not available, and,
  therefore, not included in the FRAP assessment. Most variation in dietary FRAP scores
  was explained by intakes of coffee and tea. As it had been suggested that this FRAP
  table is best suited for ranking individuals than using the exact values, FRAP was
  analyzed after stratification into tertiles of the total population of analysis.\n\nAdditionally,
  we assessed the dietary intake of the following individual antioxidants: vitamin
  A, C, E, selenium, flavonoids, alpha and beta carotene, lutein, zeaxanthine, beta
  cryptoxanthin and lycopene. These have been suggested to be potentially related
  to cancer risk.\n\n\n\nThe diagnoses of breast cancer were obtained through the
  general practitioners and by linkage with a nationwide registry of histo and cytopathology
  in the Netherlands. Two research physicians independently assessed the first date
  and diagnosis of breast cancer. All events were coded according to the International
  Classification of Diseases. In case of discrepancy, consensus was sought, or a cancer
  epidemiologist decided. Data on breast cancer incidence was available until December
  2010.\n\n\n\nAt baseline of the Rotterdam Study, during the home interview the participants
  provided information about socioeconomic background, demographics and lifestyle
  habits. Weight and height were measured at first visit at the study center. Household
  income was categorized into two categories: low to intermediate and intermediate
  to high income. Educational level was categorized into two categories: lower education
  and higher education. Smoking status was categorized into three categories: never
  smoked, former smoker, current smoker. Alcohol consumption was categorized into
  four categories: less than one drink per week, one drink per week, two drinks per
  week and three or more drinks per week. Family history of breast cancer, menopausal
  hormone therapy and multivitamin use were categorized into dichotomous variables.
  Reproductive history was categorized into three categories as having no children,
  having one to four children and having more than four children. Body mass index
  was categorized into four categories: underweight, normal BMI, overweight and obese.
  Comorbidities at baseline were defined as any history of cardiometabolic diseases
  such as diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular outcomes.\n\n\n\nThe characteristics
  of the population within the Rotterdam Study have been described previously. For
  our analysis, we used a population of 7,983 participants and excluded men and women
  with a history of breast cancer. The remaining population were 4,877 women over
  the age of 55 years old. In addition to this, we excluded 1,668 women without dietary
  data. Dietary data was missing when: Individuals were included during the pilot
  phase of the study, Individuals were institutionalized and The research dietician
  considered the dietary data unreliable when subjects had difficulties with recall
  of their food intake or when dementia was suspected. The final population that was
  analyzed consisted of 3,209 women of whom 199 developed breast cancer during follow-up.\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst,
  we used Chi-square-test for the categorical variables to study whether there were
  any differences in characteristics between subjects with different FRAP intake.
  Continuous variables were analyzed by using one-way ANOVA test. Subsequently, crude
  and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models were performed to evaluate the association
  between dietary FRAP score, dietary antioxidant intake and breast cancer risk. Dietary
  FRAP score was analyzed as continuous variable and as categorical variable after
  stratification into tertiles. Dietary FRAP and dietary antioxidant intake were adjusted
  for total energy intake by using the residual method. The crude model was adjusted
  for age. Subsequently, in the multivariate model we adjusted for the following potential
  confounders: BMI, educational level, household income, family history of breast
  cancer, smoking status, alcohol consumption, dietary fat intake, dietary fiber intake,
  reproductive history, comorbidities to baseline and hormone and multivitamin use.
  To evaluate potential confounding, these variables were stepwise added to the crude
  model. When the effect estimate changed by more than 10%, the variable was kept
  in the final multivariate model. To evaluate potential effect modification, interaction
  was tested by smoking status, alcohol intake, BMI and age in the final multivariate
  model. Stratified analyses by median values were performed when p-value for interaction
  was less than 0.10. To reduce potential bias associated with missing data, a multiple
  imputation procedure of missing data was performed. To prevent potential reverse
  causality, sensitivity analysis was performed by excluding all breast cancer cases
  that occurred in the first 24 months of the follow up time. Also, sensitivity analysis
  was performed after excluding subjects with any use of supplementation. Results
  are presented as hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals. A p-value of 0.05 was
  considered as statistically significant. Analyses were performed using IBM SPSS
  Statistics 21.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nA total of 199 breast cancer cases were diagnosed
  in the total population during a median follow-up time of 17 years. Baseline characteristics
  of the population are presented in Table 1. Age was significantly lower when dietary
  FRAP was higher and subjects with high dietary FRAP were more often no alcohol drinker
  or no smoker and had less often comorbidities at baseline.\n\n\n\nSubjects with
  moderate and high dietary FRAP at baseline had a lower risk of developing breast
  cancer during follow-up when compared to subjects with low dietary FRAP after adjustment
  for potential confounders. Additional adjustment for hormone use, reproductive history
  and dietary fat and fiber intake did not alter these effect estimates.\n\nHigh selenium
  intake was associated with a higher risk of breast cancer but this was mainly explained
  by confounders. Other individual dietary antioxidant intake were not significantly
  associated with the risk of breast cancer.  \n\n\n\n\nNo effect modification by
  smoking status, alcohol intake, BMI or age was found for the association between
  dietary FRAP and breast cancer.. However, a statistically significant interaction
  between carotenoids intake and smoking status on breast cancer risk was found. Low
  intake of alpha carotene and beta carotene was associated with a higher risk of
  breast cancer among smokers. Also, significant interaction between flavonoids intake
  and age was found. Subjects of 70 years and older who had a low intake of flavonoids
  had a higher risk of breast cancer. Additional sensitivity analysis showed similar
  effect estimates for all other analyses after excluding breast cancer cases that
  occurred within 24 first months of follow-up and after excluding subjects that used
  any supplementation. Also, results after the multiple imputation procedure did not
  differ from the original data.  \n\n\n\n\nIn this study, we found that high dietary
  antioxidant capacity, as assessed by FRAP, was associated with a decreased risk
  of breast cancer. Individual antioxidants were not significantly associated with
  the risk of breast cancer with the exception of the association in specific subgroups.
  These results suggest that the association between dietary antioxidants and breast
  cancer risk may be restricted to the overall antioxidant capacity of a diet to which
  multiple individual antioxidant components contribute.\n\nTo our knowledge, few
  studies focused on the influence of overall antioxidant capacity as measured by
  FRAP rather than individual contributions of food items and the risk of breast cancer.
  Nevertheless, the concept that overall dietary antioxidant capacity may play a role
  in cancer development has been suggested earlier. In addition, a case control study
  assessed the association between the urine levels of advanced oxidative protein
  products, hydrogen peroxide, malondialdehyde and FRAP with breast cancer. The authors
  found that FRAP was statistically significantly lower in breast cancer cases. However,
  another case control study could not confirm this. Laboratory-based experimental
  studies also have suggested that a complex mixture of antioxidants present in whole
  foods may be more effective than isolated antioxidants in cancer development. For
  example, Faria et al. showed that antioxidant capacity inhibits growth of breast
  cancer cells. Wang et al. showed that plant-based foods can be strong inhibitors
  of human breast cancer cells and evidence was found for synergistic and antagonistic
  antioxidant capacity of multiple foods. However, the authors did not find evidence
  that the interactive antioxidant capacity had antiproliferative effects on breast
  cancer cells.\n\nOxidative DNA damage is one of the most commonly proposed pathway
  leading to carcinogenesis which is strongly determined by body iron storage. In
  our population, coffee and tea were the major contributors of dietary FRAP. Coffee
  and tea may inhibit iron absorption in the small intestine and thereby decreasing
  oxidative stress through reducing body iron storage. In line with this, it has been
  recently confirmed that coffee but not tea was associated with lower levels of oxidative
  DNA damage and decreased body iron storage in women. However, results on coffee
  and tea consumption on breast cancer risk are still inconsistent. Hence, further
  study on how dietary FRAP influence breast cancer development is required.\n\nOur
  results on the individual antioxidants are in line with some previous large scale
  studies on breast cancer and dietary antioxidant intake. The EPIC study found no
  overall association between dietary beta carotene, flavonoids, vitamin C and vitamin
  E intake and breast cancer risk, but it was suggested that there may be an inverse
  trend between antioxidant compounds and ER negative tumors. Also, the Swedish Mammography
  Screening Cohort found no association between beta carotene, retinol, vitamin C
  and E intake and breast cancer risk but results indicated a protective role of vitamin
  C in women who were overweight. However, we could not confirm this in our study.
  Interestingly, the Nurses Health Study found an inverse association between dietary
  beta carotene, lutein, zeaxanthine, vitamin A and breast cancer risk in post and
  premenopausal women but this was not confirmed by the Iowa Womens Health Study.\n\nOur
  results on dietary carotenoids intake and breast cancer risk among smokers are in
  line with results from the Swedish Mammography Screening Cohort who found no overall
  association with dietary carotenoids intake and breast cancer risk but they found
  a decreased risk of breast cancer in smokers with high intake of alpha carotene
  and beta carotene. Additionally, a meta-analysis of eight prospective studies found
  the same trend for total carotenoids serum levels in current smokers. Similarly,
  the Nurses Health Study reported that there was no association between dietary intake
  of carotenoids and other antioxidants and breast cancer but they also suggested
  that high intake of vitamin A may be related to reduced risk of breast cancer among
  smokers. Low intake of carotenoids in smokers may increase the risk of breast cancer
  due to increased oxidative stress by both risk factors as the interplay between
  carotenoids and smoking has been described earlier. In addition, it has been suggested
  that cigarette smoke can alter carotenoids status in both blood and tissues by increased
  metabolic turnover of the carotenoids and modification of carotenoid compounds.
  Nevertheless, in a large scale case control study conducted among Hispanic and non-Hispanic
  women no effect modification was found by smoking on breast cancer risk. Hence,
  the relationship between smoking, dietary carotenoids intake and breast cancer risk
  needs further clarification.\n\nFinally, we found that low dietary flavonoids intake
  was associated with breast cancer risk in people over 70 years old. This has not
  been found in earlier studies but may be explained by an additive or synergistic
  effect of low flavonoid intake and age. These mechanisms, which are proposed from
  animal studies, may be related to DNA damaging through oxidative stress or by altering
  cell signal transduction. Flavonoids have been shown to have a variety of both anticancer
  and antiageing effects including reducing oxidative stress by regulating redox state,
  regulating cell growth and protein homeostasis through the target-of-rapamycin pathway
  and insulin/IGF-1-like signaling. We speculate that the aging process combined with
  low dietary flavonoids intake may alter these latter biological processes that may
  increase breast cancer risk especially in elderly subjects.\n\nA strength of this
  study is the prospective study design minimizing recall bias associated with breast
  cancer diagnosis and the large study population drawn from the general population
  enhancing the external validity of the results. Also, the use of FRAP enables us
  to assess the overall effect of antioxidant power instead of individual effects
  of antioxidants and is a novel approach in studying the relationship between dietary
  antioxidants and breast cancer. However, to appreciate the results some limitations
  of this study need to be considered. We used a SFFQ to assess dietary antioxidant
  intake. As a result, measurement error in dietary intake may still be present. Although
  adjustment for total energy can reduce the magnitude of measurement errors, random
  error may have diluted our results on individual dietary antioxidant intake. In
  addition, a meta-analysis showed that there may be a protective effect of high levels
  of beta carotene when assessed from blood levels but not when assessed from diet.
  Unfortunately, no biomarker data on antioxidant status was available in our study
  to strengthen our conclusions. Also, we did not have detailed data on vitamin supplementation
  which may contribute to overall FRAP. Nevertheless, only when supplement use would
  be related to breast cancer risk our HR may be underestimated. Although we adjusted
  our analyses for any supplement use, a very recent study has shown that supplement
  use is unrelated to breast cancer risk among 32,665 middle-aged women in the UK
  Womens Cohort Study. In addition, excluding subjects using any supplementation did
  not alter our results. Hence, it may be unlikely that an underestimation of FRAP
  by excluding supplements in the assessment have led to invalid conclusions in our
  study population.\n\nIt has been discussed that methods assessing antioxidant capacity
  of plasma are of limited use for identifying antioxidant mechanisms as there is
  not a direct relationship between the antioxidant content of a food and the subsequent
  cellular antioxidant activity. The scope of this study, however, was to assess whether
  ranking of the overall dietary antioxidant capacity on the basis of FRAP is associated
  with breast cancer risk and not to identify specific antioxidant mechanisms that
  may play a role in the development of breast cancer.\n\nAdditionally, physical activity
  levels were not measured at baseline and physical activity might be associated with
  a decreased risk of breast cancer which may lead to residual confounding. Also,
  data expression of estrogen receptors and progesterone receptors in tumors were
  not available, whereas it has been reported that effects of diet may be different
  according to these tumor properties.\n\nIn conclusion, the results of this study
  indicate that high overall dietary antioxidant capacity is associated with a decreased
  risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal women. Individual antioxidants are not associated
  with overall breast cancer risk emphasizing the need of appraising antioxidant dietary
  levels and contribution as a whole rather than evaluating individual effects. Additional
  studies are needed to gain further insight into the influence of antioxidant capacity
  and dietary antioxidants and the risk of breast cancer in specific subgroups such
  as smokers and elderly aged 70 years and older.\n\n\n\nAll funding sources had no
  role in design and conduct of this manuscript; collection, management, analysis,
  and interpretation of the data; and preparation, review or approval of this manuscript.\n"
