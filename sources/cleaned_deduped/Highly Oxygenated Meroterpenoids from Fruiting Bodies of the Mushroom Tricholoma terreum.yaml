  Four new meroterpenoids, terreumols A–D, with a rare 10-membered ring system, were
  isolated from the fruiting bodies of Tricholoma terreum. Their structures with absolute
  stereochemistry were determined by comprehensive spectroscopic methods, as well
  as single-crystal X-ray diffractions. Compounds 1, 3, and 4 were evaluated for their
  cytotoxicities against five human cancer cell lines; all of them exhibited inhibitory
  effects, with IC50 values comparable to those of cisplatin.


  Meroterpenoids are broadly defined as compounds of mixed biosynthetic origin containing
  either a phenolic, a quinine, or a closely related subunit linked to a terpenoid
  moiety by at least one C–C bond,(1) which have been found in plants, marine organisms,
  and higher fungi. More significantly, the family has the reputation for displaying
  potent biological activities, and members have been reported to be anti-inflammatory,(2)
  antimalarial,(2a) antioxidants,(2b, 3) antitumor,(2d, 4) antibacterials,(1e, 4c,
  5) and ras farnesyl-protein transferase inhibitors(6) and to show severe ichthyotoxic
  effects.(7) Besides their interesting pharmacological properties, they have complicated
  biosynthetic origins and arouse interest from synthetic chemists.(1e, 8)


  The wild mushroom Tricholoma equestre has caused poisoning in southwestern France.
  Twelve people were hospitalized for severe weakness and muscle loss after eating
  the mushrooms, and three of them died.(9) Despite the highly toxic nature of T.
  equestre, the poison in this mushroom has not been characterized. This inspired
  us to investigate the toxic constituents of T. equestre and related species. When
  we collected T. equestre, the mushroom Tricholoma terreum, another species of the
  same genus, was harvested from the same environment. Since T. equestre could be
  mistaken for other members of the Tricholoma genus or similar myotoxic effects could
  be caused by other related fungus, T. terreum was tested and investigated for the
  suspected myotoxicity.


  In this paper, we report four rare meroterpenoids, terreumols A–D, from the basidiomycete
  T. terreum. Notably, terreumols A–D contain two C–C bonds between a benzene ring
  and the terpenoid moieties, building a rare 10-membered carbon ring that has been
  previously reported in wigandol from leaves and flowers of Wigandia kunthii,(10)
  flavidulols from the mushroom Lactarius flavidulus,(11) and globiferin from Cordia
  globifera.(12) The absolute configuration of terreumols A–D was determined by X-ray
  diffraction. These compounds showed cytotoxic activity.




  Terreumol A was isolated as yellow crystals. The molecular formula C17H20O6 was
  determined by HREIMS at m/z 320.1258, corresponding to eight degrees of unsaturation.
  The IR data at 3440 cm–1 revealed the presence of hydroxy groups, while the UV absorptions
  at 372 and 291 nm suggested the presence of a multiconjugated moiety. The 1D NMR
  spectra, as well as the HSQC spectrum, revealed 17 carbon resonances, which were
  ascribed to three methyls, three methylenes, three methines, and eight quaternary
  carbons. Overall consideration of the NMR data suggested that compound 1 was a meroterpenoid
  similar to wigandol,(10) but highly oxygenated. In detail, one olefinic proton at
  δH 6.52, together with six olefinic carbons at δC 159.2, 99.7, 155.0, 139.7, 115.2,
  and 123.6, indicated the presence of one five-substituted benzene ring. One downfield
  signal of a hydroxy proton at δH 11.97 indicated the existence of one intramolecular
  hydrogen bond. In addition the proton showed HMBC correlations to C-1, C-2, C-13
  and δC 199.6, indicating the carbonyl carbon to be connected with the benzene ring
  at C-13, which was also supported by the UV absorptions at 372 and 291 nm. In the
  HMBC spectrum, the correlations from another hydroxy proton at δH 7.85 to δC 139.7,
  155.0, and 123.6, from δH 3.96 to C-3, and from H-2 to C-3 allowed the hydroxy and
  the methoxy to be assigned at C-4 and C-3, respectively. The remaining 10 carbons
  were readily assigned to a monoterpenoid moiety, showing similarities to that of
  wigandol,(10) which formed a 10-membered ring system. The four oxygenated carbons
  at δC 60.4, 66.1, 64.7, and 64.4 suggested that the 1,5-diene in wigandol was replaced
  with two epoxy moieties in 1, as well as by the MS data; this was confirmed by analysis
  of the HMBC and 1H–1H COSY correlations. Detailed analysis of 2D NMR data identified
  the planar structure of 1. The ROESY spectrum could not completely determine the
  stereochemistry of 1 because of the 10-membered ring in the structure. Fortunately,
  an X-ray diffraction not only confirmed the planar structure of 1 but also determined
  the absolute configuration as shown in Figure 3.

  of C-8 in 2.









  Terreumol B was isolated as a yellow powder. The HREIMS displayed an + peak at m/z
  336.1216, which analyzed for C17H20O7, 16 mass units more than that of 1. The UV
  absorptions at 362 and 286 nm together with the 13C NMR data were quite similar
  to those of compound 1, except that the methylene at δC 25.5 was oxidized into a
  methine at δC 69.0, resulting in a downfield shift of C-7 and C-9 in compound 2,
  consistent with the 1H–1H COSY correlations of H-7/H-8/H-9. Detailed analysis of
  1D and 2D NMR data suggested that the remainder of 2 was identical to that of 1.
  Biogenetically, the absolute configurations of C-6, C-7, C-10, and C-11 in 2 would
  be expected to be the same as those of 1. In the ROESY spectrum, the correlations
  among H-5b, H-8, and H3-16 were observed, which allowed H-8 to be placed on the
  same side as H3-16. In addition only the S form can satisfy the ROESY correlations
  mentioned above, as shown by 3D structure models. Therefore, compound 2 was established
  as terreumol B, as shown.


  Terreum C, isolated as yellow needle crystals from acetone, had the molecular formula
  C17H20O5, according to its HREIMS at m/z 304.1327, 16 mass units less than that
  of 1. The UV absorptions at 371 and 291 nm indicated that the multiconjugated moiety
  remained. By intensive comparison of the 1H and 13C NMR data with those of 1, the
  significant differences were the absence of two oxygenated carbon signals in 3 and
  the presence of a trisubstituted carbon double bond. In the 1H–1H COSY spectrum,
  the correlations of H-7/H-8 located the double bond between C-6 and C-7, which was
  further supported by the HMBC correlations from H-7 to C-5, C-8, and C-9. Finally,
  the X-ray diffraction determined the absolute structure of 3 as shown in Figure
  3.


  Terreum D had an + peak at m/z 320.1258 in the HREIMS, 16 mass units more than that
  of 3. Compound 4 was readily identified as the 8-OH derivative of 3 from 1H and
  13C NMR data at δC 66.1 and δH 4.73, which was confirmed by the HMBC correlations
  from H-8 to C-6, C-7, C-9, and C-10. Detailed analysis of the 2D NMR data confirmed
  that the other parts were the same as those of 3. Finally, C-8 was determined to
  be S configured, the same as that of 2. Thus, the structure of compound 4 was elucidated
  as terreum D, as shown.


  Compounds 1, 3, and 4 were evaluated for cytotoxicity against five human cancer
  cell lines using the MTT method as reported previously.(13) All three compounds
  showed comparable cytotoxicities with those of cisplatin, and their IC50 values
  are presented in Table 2.







  Melting points were obtained on a Yuhua X-4 digital microdisplaying melting point
  apparatus. Optical rotations were recorded on a JASCO P-1020 digital polarimeter.
  UV and the IR spectra were obtained on a Shimadzu UV2401PC and a Bruker Tensor 27
  FT-IR spectrometer with KBr pellets. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectra were obtained
  on a Bruker Avance III 600 MHz spectrometer with tetramethylsilane as an internal
  standard at room temperature. High-resolution EIMS were recorded on a Waters AutoSpec
  Premier P776. X-ray diffractions were performed on an APEX DUO spectrophotometer.
  Silica gel and reverse-phase C18 gel were used for open column chromatography. Preparative
  HPLC was performed on an Agilent 1100 liquid chromatography system equipped with
  a Zorbax SB-C18 column. Fractions were monitored by TLC. Spots were visualized by
  heating silica gel plates immersed in vanillin–H2SO4 in ethanol.



  The mushroom Tricholoma terreum was collected from southwestern France in 2011 and
  identified by Prof. Zhu-Liang Yang, Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy
  of Sciences. A specimen was deposited at Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy
  of Sciences. The collection was permitted by the local forest authority.



  The dried fruiting bodies of T. terreum were extracted with CHCl3–MeOH. The extract
  was separated by solvent partition between EtOAc and water. The EtOAc layer was
  concentrated under reduced pressure to give a crude extract, and this residue was
  subjected to silica gel CC, eluted with a gradient of CHCl3–MeOH, to obtain seven
  fractions. Fraction C was separated by RP-18 to give 14 subfractions. Fraction C6
  was subjected to silica gel CC and further purified by semipreparatiive HPLC to
  yield 2 and 4. Fraction C7 was purified by silica gel CC to obtain 1. Finally, fraction
  C8 was purified by semipreparative HPLC to afford 3.

  Compound 1 was obtained as yellow crystals from acetone. The crystal structure was
  solved by direct methods using SHELXS-97 with Cu Kα radiation, expanded using geometrical
  calculations and difference Fourier techniques, and refined using full-matrix least-squares
  on F2. Non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically, and all hydrogen atoms were
  located by geometry and refined as riding atoms with relative isotropic parameters.

  Five human cancer cell lines, breast cancer MCF-7, hepatocellular carcinoma SMMC-7721,
  human myeloid leukemia HL-60, colon cancer SW480, and lung cancer A-549 cells, were
  used in the cytotoxicity assay. All the cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 or DMEM
  medium, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The cytotoxicity
  assay was performed according to the MTT-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) method
  in 96-well microplates.(13) Briefly, 100 μL of adherent cells was seeded into each
  well of 96-well cell culture plates and allowed to adhere for 12 h before drug addition,
  while suspended cells were seeded just before drug addition with an initial density
  of 1 × 105 cells/mL. Each tumor cell line was exposed to the test compound dissolved
  in DMSO at concentrations of 0.0625, 0.32, 1.6, 8, and 40 μmol in triplicates for
  48 h, with cisplatin and vinorelbine as positive controls. After compound treatment,
  cell viability was detected and a cell growth curve was graphed. IC50 values were
  calculated by Reed and Muench’s method.(14)
