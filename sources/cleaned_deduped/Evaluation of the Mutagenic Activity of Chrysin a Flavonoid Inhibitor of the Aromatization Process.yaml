  of the Mutagenic Activity of Chrysin a Flavonoid Inhibitor of the Aromatization
  Process.md
text: '


  Chrysin is one of the natural flavonoids present in plants, and large amounts are
  present in honey and propolis. In addition to anticancer, antioxidation, and anti-inflammatory
  activities, chrysin has also been reported to be an inhibitor of aromatase, an enzyme
  converting testosterone into estrogen. The present study evaluated the mutagenicity
  of this flavonoid using micronucleus  with HepG2 cells and Salmonella. Cell survival
  after exposure to different concentrations of chrysin was also determined using
  sulforhodamine B  colorimetric assay in HepG2 cells and the influence of this flavonoid
  on growth of cells in relation to the cell cycle and apoptosis. The MN test showed
  that from 1 to 15 M of this flavonoid mutagenic activity was noted in HepG2 cells.
  The Salmonella assay demonstrated a positive response to the TA100 Salmonella strain
  in the presence or absence of S9, suggesting that this compound acted on DNA, inducing
  base pair substitution before or after metabolism via cytochrome P-450. The SRB
  assay illustrated that chrysin promoted growth inhibition of HepG2 cells in both
  periods studied. After 24 h of exposure it was noted that the most significant results
  were obtained with a concentration of 50 M, resulting in 83% inhibition and SubG0
  percentage of 12%. After 48 h of incubation cell proliferation inhibition rates  were
  significantly higher. Our results showed that chrysin is a mutagenic and cytotoxic
  compound in cultured human HepG2 cells and Salmonella typhimurium. Although it is
  widely accepted that flavonoids are substances beneficial to health, one must evaluate
  the risk versus benefit relationship and concentrations of these substances to which
  an individual may be exposed.'
