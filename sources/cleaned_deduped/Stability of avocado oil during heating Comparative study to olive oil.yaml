  oil, under a drastic heating treatment, was studied and compared to that of olive
  oil. Avocado and olive oil were characterised and compared at time 0 h and after
  different times of heating process. PUFA/SFA and Ï\x89-6/Ï\x89-3 were higher in
  avocado oil than in olive oil during the whole experiment. Avocado oil was richer
  than olive oil in total phytosterols at time 0 h and at 9 h of heating. TBARs was
  higher in olive oil after 3 h, reaching the maximum values in both oils at 6 h of
  heating treatment. Vitamin E was higher in olive oil and it disappeared earlier
  in avocado oil. The stability of avocado oil was similar to that of olive oil."
