  as well as health benefits of both extracts and bioactive compounds from various
  types of berries including small soft-fleshed edible berries and from berry-like
  fruits such as strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, blueberries, mulberries,
  currants, gooseberries, elderberries, açai berries, and pomegranates. In particular,
  we describe how berry-derided phytochemicals, including anthocyanidins, proanthocyanidins,
  flavonols, flavanols, stilbenoids, terpenoids, ellagitannins, and ellagic acid target
  oxidative and UV radiation stress-induced DNA damage, Helicobacter pilori infection,
  pro-inflammatory as well as the major cancer hallmarks. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBerries
  have been consumed since the Neolithic age, with particularly high consumption rates
  in Scandinavian and South American countries over the last centuries. Berries are
  often used as medicinal food, and the applications of berries as chemopreventive
  anti-inflammatory or anti-cancer agents, as anti-inflammatory remedies, as cancer
  treatment adjuvants, or as cosmetics have been the subject of a large number of
  patents and clinical trials. The widely accepted healthy virtues of berries, which
  comprise anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, fever-suppressing, pain-killing, detoxifying,
  anti-diabetic, anti-aging, and anti-cancer properties, are due to the fruits’ richness
  in phytochemicals and in micronutrients such as vitamins A, B9, C, and E, calcium,
  magnesium, potassium, iron, zinc, and selenium. Scientists have been aware of the
  close connection between inflammation and cancer since the middle of the nineteenth
  century, and it is now widely accepted that inflammation is a critical component
  of tumor progression. Here, we describe the chemical properties and anti-inflammatory
  and anti-cancer bioactivities of the major compounds found in small soft-fleshed
  edible berries and in berry-like fruits, and we explain why the regular consumption
  of berries is beneficial to our health, especially in the context of inflammation
  and cancer.\n\n\n\nThe most commonly consumed small soft-fleshed berries and berry-like
  fruits include strawberries, red raspberries, black raspberries, blackberries, mulberries,
  blueberries, cranberries, black currants, red currants, gooseberries, pomegranate,
  elderberries, grapes, and açai berries. Less commonly consumed edible berries with
  bioactive properties include honeysuckle, persimmons, Indian gooseberries, and goji
  berries. Botanical berries which are not considered as berries in common parlance,
  such as tomatoes, chilli peppers, kiwi, starfruit, and sapote are not dealt with
  in the present paper. Powdered extracts and freshly prepared berry drinks are widely
  available on the market, and are often described as “superfoods”. Moreover recent
  reporst describe new isotonic blends with lemon and anthocyanins-rich berries with
  higher antioxidant and biological effects. The consumption of berries, whether as
  fresh fruits, as powdered formula, or in drinks, has been associated with a large
  number of health benefits, ranging from anti-bacterial and anti-viral effects to
  the protection against inflammation, cancer, and hearth diseases. Clinical trials
  have shown that the consumption of pomegranate juice, for instance, can significantly
  delay the reoccurrence and metastsis of prostate cancer following radical surgery
  or radiation therapy. In the context of inflammation and cancer, berry components
  are known to act as chemopreventive agents targeting oxidation, UV radiation, and
  resulting DNA damage, bacterial infection, pro-inflammatory and carcinogenic cell
  signaling cascades, cancer cell growth and proliferation, cellular immortality,
  angiogenesis and metastasis, and the erythropoietic differentiation of leukaemia
  cells. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUltraviolet radiation and reactive oxygen species, which
  include superoxide radicals, hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radicals, and singlet oxygen,
  plays a critical role in the initiation and in the development of a very wide range
  of diseases. Oxidative stress and UV radiation can cause cellular damage by oxidizing
  DNA or proteins, or by causing lipid peroxidation. DNA damage can lead to mutations
  and to cancer, and protein oxidation can lead to protein degradation, protein denaturation,
  and loss off enzymatic activity. Inflamed cells are known to release ROS, and many
  transcription factors implicated in carcinogenesis and in inflammation are redox-sensitive.
  For these reasons, oxidation and UV radiation stress are important targets for anti-inflammatory
  and anti-cancer compounds. Most importantly, anti-oxidants and sunscreens can reduce
  the risk of tumor formation before it becomes a serious health issue. Berries are
  particularly rich in anti-oxidants, and chemopreventive pilot studies have shown
  that a long-term consumption of berries significantly increases the anti-oxidant
  status of blood serum. The anti-oxidant potential of berries and of other fruits
  is often expressed as oxygen radical absorbance capacity. While anti-oxidant molecules
  in food have a wide range of functionswhich are not necessarily related to the ability
  to absorb free radicals, ORAC values, which are listed in Table 1, are a good indicator
  of the anti-oxidant potential of berries in comparison with other fruits and vegetables.
  Recently Chen et al. underlined the great potential to improve human health through
  consumption of colored berries, especially those high in antioxidant capacity.\n\n\nOxygen
  radical absorbance capacity of berries and other fruits)  \n\n\n\n\nBeside UV radiation
  and oxidative stress, bacterial and viral infections are known to be a major factor
  contributing to chronic inflammation and to cancer. As a matter of fact, parasitic
  viri and bacteria have been shown to be capable of using the NF-κB pathway, which
  is common to inflammation and cancer development, to secure their survival in their
  host organisms. Helicobacter pilori is notorious for its implications in chronic
  gastritis, which can progress towards intestinal metaplasis. Cranberry, raspberry,
  and strawberry extracts are capable of preventing the adhesion of H. pylori to the
  gastric mucosa cells. In addition to cranberry, raspberry, and strawberry extracts,
  black currant, blueberry, pomegranate, and grape extracts have been shown to prevent
  gastrointestinal cell infection by pathogenic Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria,
  without having any adverse effect on the beneficial gut microflora. The infection
  by Gram-negative bacteria such as Vibrio cholera, Shigella dysenteriae, Campylobacter
  spp., and Salmonella enterica is achieved through an interference with the latter’s
  binding to the intestinal mucosa cells.\n\n\n\nOxidative stress, UV radiation, and
  microbial infection, together with other inflammatory or carcinogenic stimuli such
  as injuries or extra-cellular cytokine, all culminate upstream of a series of cell
  signaling cascades leading to inflammation, cancer cell immortality, angiogenesis,
  and metastasis. Signaling cascades targeted by berry-derived compounds include the
  PI-3K/Akt pathway, the Ras/MAPK pathways, the NF-κB activation pathway, and the
  JAK/STAT pathway.\n\n\n\nThe PI-3K/Akt pathway promotes cellular immortality by
  allowing damaged cells to overcome checkpoints in the cell cycle, and by preventing
  apoptosis. Once activated by survival factors, PI-3 K phosphorylates phosphatidylinostol-bisphosphate
  to form phosphatidylinostol-triphosphate, which binds to Akt. Once bound to PIP3,
  Akt is phosphorylated to its active form by phosphoinositide dependent kinase 1
  or by the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2. Activated Akt leads, in some
  circumstances, to the trespassing of the G1/S and G2/M checkpoints by damaged cells.
  The PI-3K/Akt pathway also leads to the activation of the NF-κB and MAPK signaling
  pathways, and it down-regulates the pro-apoptotic protein BAD.\n\nBlack raspberries,
  blackberries, and blueberries have been shown to inhibit the PI-3K/Akt pathway and
  the downstream MAPK and NF-κB pathways.\n\n\n\nRas/MAPK pathways are initiated by
  the activation of epidermal growth factors through various stress stimuli including
  UV radiation, bacterial or viral infections, and cytokines. Activated EGFs bind
  to EGF receptors on the cellular membrane to induce a kinase cascade that culminates
  in the phoshorylation and activation of MAPKs such as ERKs ERK1 and ERK2, JNKs MAPK8,
  MAPK9, and MAPK10, and p38 MAPKs MAPK11, MAPK12, MAPK13, and MAPK14. ERKs are involved
  in the activation of the transcription factor activator protein 1 and promotion
  of cell division, while JNKs and p38 MAPKs are involved in the production of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines such as interleukin 8, in apoptosis, and in cell differentiation.\n\nStrawberry
  extracts, which have been shown to prevent the growth and proliferation of colon,
  prostate, and breast cancer cells, inhibit TPA or UVB induced phosphorylation of
  ERKs 1 and 2 and of various JNKs. Pomegranate extracts inhibit the Ras/MAPK pathway
  by interfering with the phosphorylation of JNK and p38. The inhibition of JNK and
  p38 MAPK activation is responsible for the rather unique property possessed by pomegranate
  extracts of inducing erythroid differentiation in leukaemia cells. Black raspberry,
  blackberry, and blueberry extracts inhibit the activation of ERKs, JNKs, and p38
  MAPKs.\n\n\n\nUpon stimulation by cytokines, UV radiation, or oxidative stress,
  the IκB kinase IKK phosphorylates IκB. Once phosphorylated, IκB is targeted for
  degradation by the 26S proteasome, and the free, activated transcription factor
  NF-κB is able to translocate into the nucleus and to induce the transcription of
  specific genes, many of which are genes responsible for inflammation, cell proliferation,
  or cell growth. Pro-inflammatory genes and carcinogenes transcribed by NF-κB include
  IL-1β, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, and cyclin D1. IL-1β and IL-6 induce the expression
  of cycloxygenase 2 and of inducible nitric oxide synthase, leading to the production
  of prostaglandin E2 and of nitric oxide, respectively. COX-2 is involved in many
  inflammatory processes and induces various carcinomas, and a constitutive overexpression
  of COX-2 causes a high level of resistance to apoptosis, as COX-2 promotes the stabilization
  of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein survivin.\n\nBlackberry, black raspberry,
  blueberry, cranberry, grape, raspberry, elderberry, pomegranate, strawberry, and
  black raspberry extracts have been shown to inhibit NF-κB activation. The inhibition
  of NF-κB by plack raspberries results from the phosphorylation of IκB-α and from
  the inhibition of the PI-K/Akt pathway. Most berry extracts, and açai berry extracts
  in particular, inhibit lipopolysaccharide-induced NF-κB activation and the subsequent
  production of COX-2 and of pro-inflammatory prostaglandins. The inhibition of the
  transcriptional activity of NF-κB by cranberry extracts has been shown to lead to
  the inhibition of COX-2 gene expression and to a decrease in the production of the
  pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α.\n\n\n\nThe JAK/STAT pathway
  is activated by the binding of growth factors and cytokines to the JAK receptor
  on the cellular membrane, resulting in a multimerization and trans-phosphorylation
  of the receptor and two JAK molecules, and in the activation of the JAKs. In turn,
  the activated JAKs phosphorylate STATs and other target molecules. Phosphorylated
  STATs enter the nucleus where they regulate the transcription of target genes. A
  dysregulation of STATs causes aberrant cell growth and angiogenesis and prevents
  apoptotis.\n\nBlack currant and blueberry extracts have been shown to inhibit the
  phosphorylation of STATs.\n\n\n\nCell cycle checkpoints help ensure the accuracy
  of DNA replication and division. Checkpoints occur late in G1 to prevent faulty
  DNA from being duplicated in the S phase of the cell cycle, and late in G2, which
  prevents damaged cells from entering into mitosis. The checkpoints are regulated
  by cyclin dependent kinases which, in turn, are controlled by cyclins. Cyclins bind
  to cdks to form activated kinases that induce the progression into the next stage
  of the cell cycle. The G1/S cell cycle checkpoint is controlled by the cdk4/6-cyclin
  D complex and by the cdk2-cyclin E complex. cdk4/6 and cdk2 permit the passage into
  the S phase by phosphorylating the cell-cycle inhibitor retinoblastoma protein.
  The phosphorylation of Rb reduces its affinity for the transcription factor E2F
  which is required for the entry into the S phase. Transforming growth factor-β causes
  synthesis of p15 and p21 which block the activity of cdk 2, 4, and 6. In cancer,
  cells proliferate aberrantly as mutated TGF-β no longer controls the G1/S checkpoint
  properly. The tumor suppressor protein p53, which normally stimulates the transcription
  of genes that inhibit cdk4/6 and cdk2 in response to DNA damage, is also often mutated
  in cancer cells. The G2/M checkpoint is regulated by the cdk1-cyclin B complex.
  During G2, cdk1 is maintained inactive by the kinases Wee1 and Mt1. Once the G2/M
  checks have been successfully completed, the phosphatase Cdc25 activates cdk1 and
  thereby induces the progression into mitosis. Defects in p53 or in endogenous cdk
  inhibitors such as p21 prevent the cell cycle arrests required for repairs to damaged
  DNA. One of the functions of the anti-cancer drug paclitaxel is to activate the
  cdk1-cyclin B1 complex.\n\nBlackberry, black raspberry, blueberry, cranberry, grape,
  raspberry, and strawberry extracts inhibit the growth of breast, cervical, colon,
  and prostate cancer cell-lines. The extracts induce cell cycle arrest at the G1/S
  checkpoint by down-regulating the expression of cyclin kinases cdk2, cdk4, and cdk6
  and of cyclin D. Pomegranate extracts arrest human lung carcinoma cells at the G1/S
  checkpoint by downregulating the expression of cyclin-dependent kinases cdk2, cdk4,
  and cdk6 and of cyclins D and E.\n\n\n\nApoptosis, the process of programmed cell
  death, is a critical mechanism by which damaged, infected, or excessive cells are
  removed from the cell pool. Failure to initiate apoptosis when needed is a hallmark
  for cancer development. Apoptosis can be activated by an extrinsic pathway involving
  the binding of extra-cellular death receptor ligands to their corresponding receptors
  on the cell membrane or by a mitochondria-mediated intrinsic pathway. The major
  death receptors involved in the extrinsic apoptotic pathway include the Fas receptor
  and the TNF-α-related apoptosis-inducing ligand receptor. The binding of the extra-cellular
  ligands to the death receptors induces a pathway culminating in the activation of
  the cystein protease caspase 3. The activation of caspase 3 is also the ultimate
  outcome of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway as a result of an imbalance between mitochondrial
  pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins such as Bax, Bak, Bad, and Bid and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2
  proteins such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL in favor of the pro-apoptotic proteins. Caspase
  3 activates the endonuclease which leads to chromatin condensation and packages
  the cellular components into apoptosomes for degradation by neighboring cells. Viral
  infections can interfere with the extrinsic Fas-ligand dependent apoptotic pathway
  or inhibit the pro-apoptotic proteins p53, Bax, and Bad. Carcinogens can induce
  mutations in the pro-apoptotic protein p53 or upset the balance between Bcl-2 proteins
  in favor of the anti-apoptotic proteins.\n\nBlackberries, raspberries, black raspberries,
  blueberries, grapes, strawberries, and cranberries have the strongest pro-apoptotic
  potential amongst berry-derived products. Açai berries have also been reported as
  inducers of apoptosis in cancer cells. A major mechanism of action of berry-derived
  apoptosis promoters involves the activation of Bax. Pomegranate induces apoptosis
  by inducing the pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and Bak, and by down-regulating the anti-apoptotic
  proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL.\n\n\n\nWhen tumours start to invade the surrounding tissue
  and to metastasize throughout the body, they become cancerous and malignant. Cancerous
  cells use very aggressive strategies to trespass into the blood steam and into the
  various types of tissues. Once cancer cells have detached themselves from their
  primary site, they release vascular endothelial growth factor and matrix metalloproteinases
  which dissolve the extracellular matrix and basement membranes that separate the
  cancer cells from blood vessels and timulate the growth of new blood vessels to
  be used by the cancer cells for spreading through the body. MMP-2 and MMP-9 are
  thought to play a critical role in metastasis, while MMP-1 is thought to play an
  important role in rheumatoid andosteoarthritis. MMPs are normally inhibited by specific
  endogenous tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases. Tissue invasion and metastasis
  are the major culprits in cancer lethality. Malignant spreading of cancer cells
  leads to the physical and functional disruption of vital tissues and organs, and
  metastasis to numerous distant locations throughout the body makes the treatment
  of the disease notoriously difficult. In vitro and animal studies have shown that
  berry extracts prevent angiogenesis by inhibiting the expression of VEGF. The strongest
  berry-related anti-angiogenic activities have been found in raspberry, blueberry,
  and cranberry juices. Black raspberries extracts inhibit angiogenesis by targeting
  VEGF. Cranberry extracts are known to inhibit the expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9,
  and to increase the expression of TIMPs in prostate cancer cells. Blueberries extracts
  down-regulate VEGF and matrix metalloproteinases MMP-2 and MMP-9, and they increase
  the secretion of the endogenous MMP inhibitor TIMP-1. Pomegranate extracts inhibit
  the expression of VEGF and of MMP-1, MMP-3, and MMP-13. Grape extracts inhibit MMP-2
  and MMP-9.\n\n\n\nNumerous studies have been undertaken over the years to characterize
  the chemical composition of edible berries, and to investigate the bioactivities
  of the isolated compounds. The major compounds responsible for the health-beneficial
  properties of edible berries are phytochemicals, including phenolics, terpenoids,
  and micronutrients such as vitamin A, B, C, selenium, zinc, and folic acid. The
  chemical composition of each type of common edible berry is given in Table 2, and
  the bioactivities of the different compounds are summarized in Table 3. The chemical
  structures of berry-derived phytochemicals are shown in Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5.\n\n\n\n\nSource
  data: Moyer et al., Bagchi et al., Seeram et al., Jing et al., Stoner et al., Seeram,
  Basu and Penugonda, Stoner, Basu et al., Borges et al., Del Rio et al.\n\n\nSources
  and bioactivities of anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory berry metabolites  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhenolics
  found in edible berries include flavonoids, ellagitannins, phenolic acids, and stilbenoids.
  Berry phenolics are best known for their ability to act as anti-oxidants, but the
  biological activities exerted by berry phenolics extend beyond anti-oxidation. They
  exhibit anti-inflammatory properties, induce carcinogen detoxification enzymes,
  and modulate signaling pathways of cancer cell proliferation and apoptosis.\n\n\n\n\n\nFlavonols
  are the most widespread flavonoids in fruits and vegetables. Like most flavonoids,
  flavonols generally exist as glycosides in nature. The most common aglycon units
  of flavonols are quercetin 1, myricetin 2, or kaempferol 3. In addition to these,
  the flavonol fisetin 4 is found in strawberries, and the flavone luteolin 5 is found
  in pomegranates and in Açai berries. The sugar moieties of glycosylated flavonols
  include galactose, arabinose, and rhamnose. Flavonols have good anti-oxidant potentials.
  The radical scavenging activity of flavonols is influenced by the number and location
  of hydroxyl groups, of sugar moieties, and of other substitutions. The required
  structural criteria for high radical scavenging activity of flavonoids included
  the presence of an ortho-dihydroxy groups in the B-ring. Quercetin 1, which is the
  most common flavonol in black raspberries, strawberries, black currants, red currants,
  and gooseberries, is known to act as an anti-inflammatory agent by inhibiting the
  expression of COX-2 and of IL-12. The inhibition of IL-12 expression is achieved
  through the blockage of the JAK/STAT signaling cascade by quercetin 1. Quercetin
  1 also induces apoptosis in leukaemia cells by inhibiting the activation of NF-κB,
  by decreasing the expression of the pro-survival protein Ras, and by increasing
  the levels of expression of the pro-apoptotic protein p53. Quercetin 1 interferes
  with the Ras/MAPK pathway by targeting the protein kinases Raf1 and MAP2K1 directly,
  without competing with ATP. The hydroxyl group at the 3′ position in the C ring
  is critical for the binding to MAP2K1, which is why kaempferol 3 and the stilbenoid
  resveratrol 6, which are structurally related to quercetin 1 but lack a hydroxyl
  group at the 3′ position, cannot inhibit MAP2K1 effectively. Quercetin 1 has also
  been shown to interfere with the PI-3K/Akt signaling pathway, an to inhibit the
  growth of colon adenocarcinoma, of breast adenocarcinoma, and the progression of
  leukaemia by arresting the cell cycle at the G1/S checkpoint by inhibiting cdk2,
  and by inducing apoptosis through the up-regulation of the pro-apoptotic proteins
  p21, Bak, Bax, cytochrome c, and caspase 3, and through a down-regulation of the
  anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. The richest sources of quercetin 1 are blueberries,
  black currants, cranberries, and lingonberries. Along with quercetin 1, myricetin
  2 and kaempferol 3 are very abundant in cranberries and in black currants. Myricetin
  2 is an anti-oxidant, and it interferes with the Ras/MAPK signaling cascades, thereby
  inhibiting the activation of NF-κB and AP-1 and the subsequent up-regulation of
  VEGF and of MMP-9. Myricetin 2 inhibits the kinase activity of MAP2K1 and MAP2K4
  by binding directly to the kinases. The binding of myricetin 2 to the kinase is
  in competition with ATP, as myricetin 2 docks into the ATP binding pocket of MAP2K4.
  Kaempferol 3 inhibits the ERK, JNK, p38 MAPK pathways and the subsequent activation
  of NF-κB and AP-1. Kaempferol 3 is also known to act as an anti-photoaging agent
  by inhibiting UV-induced COX-2 and MMP-1 expression. Fistein 4, which is found in
  strawberries and in grapes, has anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-angiogenic
  properties. Fisetin 4 also induces apoptosis by modulating the expression of pro-
  and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2-family proteins, and by up-regulating the pro-apoptotic
  caspases 3, 8, and 9. Fistein 4 targets primarily the PI-3K/Akt signaling pathway.\n\nThe
  flavone aglycon unit luteolin 5, which is a major constituent of pomegranate and
  açai berries, is a potent anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer agent.
  Luteolin 5 has been shown to target the PI-3K/Akt and Ras/MAPK signaling pathways.
  Luteolin 5 arrests cancer cells at the G1/S and G2/S checkpoints, and it induces
  apoptosis by down-regulating Bcl-2 and by up-regulating p53, Bax, and Bak. Other
  aglycone flavones with potent anti-oxidant properties that are commonly found in
  açai berries include chrysoeriol 7 and dihydrokaempferol 8.\n\nConjugation to the
  sugar moiety occurs most frequently at position 3 of the flavonoid’s C ring. Glycosylated
  flavonols and flavones commonly found in berries include rutin 9, tiliroside 10,
  orientin 11, and homoorientin 12. The rutinose glycoside of quercetin, rutin 9,
  which is particularly abundant in black currants and in lingonberries, possesses
  strong anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. The kaempferol glycoside tiliroside
  10, which is found in Açai berries, reduces the production of NO, TNF-α, and IL-12
  in LPS stimulated macrophages. Açai berries are also a rich source of the luteolin
  glycosides orientin 11 and homoorientin 12 which possess anti-oxidant properties
  and protect against radiation-induced DNA damage.\n\nStructure–activity relationship
  studies have shown that, in general, glycosylated flavonols and flavones have a
  weaker radical scavenging activity than their aglycone counterparts. Furthermore,
  glycosylated flavonols and flavones are too hydrophylic to be absorbed by passive
  diffusion in the small intestine. The glycosides are hydrolyzed by enzymes in the
  brush-border of the small intestine’s epithelial cells and enter the epithelium
  as aglycones prior to undergoing further enzymatic modifications such as sulfation,
  glucuronidation, and methylation, and to the release into the blood stream. The
  major hydrolase present in the brush borders of the small intestine is lactase phloridizin
  hydrolase. Lactase phloridizin hydrolase has a broad specificity for flavonoid-O-β-D-glucosides.
  Flavonols and flavones that are not absorbed in the small intestine can be absorbed
  in the large intestine. The colonic microflora not only hydrolyzes the glycosides
  into the aglycone and the sugar molecule, but in most cases degrades the aglycone
  unit further into phenolic acids prior to the absorption into the blood stream.
  \n\n\n\nFlavanols are a class of flavonoids that possess a 2-phenyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-chromen-3-ol
  skeleton. Flavanols are widely used in Chinese traditional medicine to treat various
  diseases, including cancer. The monomeric flavanol catechin, which is generally
  found in the-catechin 13 form in nature, and its epimer epicatechin, which occurs
  naturally as the-epicatechin 14 form, are major components of grapes, pomegranates,
  and of açai berries.-catechin 13 is one of the most potent natural ROS scavengers,
  and it provides skin cell protection against UVB-induced photoaging. Both the catechol
  moiety in the B ring and the hydroxyl function in the C ring play an important role
  towards the ROS scavenging and sunscreen potential of 13.-catechin 13 also interferes
  with the Ras/MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways, and it upregulates the expression
  of the pro-apoptotic proteins caspase 3 and Bax and downregulates the expression
  of MMP-1. Like its epimer,-epicatechin 14 is a good anti-oxidant, and it also inhibits
  the expression of iNOS.-catechin 13 and-epicatechin 14 can be hydroxylated to form-gallocatechin
  15 and-epigallocatechin 16, which also possess anti-oxidant properties. 13, 14,
  15, and 16 can polymerize into proanthocyanidins, also referred to as condensed
  tannins. Proanthocyanidins can occur as polymers of up to 50 flavanol units. The
  most common type of proanthocyanidins containcatechins as flavanol units and are
  termed procyanidins, while the rarer prodelphinins are composed ofgallocatechin
  units. Proanthocyanidin are usually “B-type” polymers in which the C4 of the heterocycle
  is linked to the C6 or C8 of the adjacent unit. “A type” proanthocyanidins, which
  are less common in nature, have an additional ether bond between C2 and C7. Proanthocyanidins
  commonly found in edible berries include the dimers epicatechin-4β-8)-catechin and
  catechin-4β-8)-epicatechin. The galloylation and polymerization of monomeric flavanols
  significantly enhances the latter’s ROS scavenging and pro-apoptotic properties.
  Proanthocyanidins have been reported to prevent the phosphorylation of STATs, to
  decrease the secretion of prostaglandin E2, to inhibit COX-2, and to interfere with
  the release of NO and of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10,
  and TNF-α from carrageenin-induced paw oedema in rats. The fate of proanthocanydins
  in the human gastrointestinal system after ingestion remains poorly understood to
  date, but animal studies have revealed that, due to the buffering effect of food
  bolus, the acid conditions in the stomach remain too mild for proanthocyanidins
  polymers to be degraded into flavanol monomers. Proanthocyanidin polymers are too
  large to be absorbed in the small intestine. They are broken down into aromatic
  acids by the microflora of the colon.\n\nAmongst the berries included in the USDA
  food composition database, cranberries are by far the most important source of proanthocyanidins,
  followed by blueberries and black currants. Black currants, red currants, and gooseberries
  contain both procyanidins and prodelphinidins in similar proportions, while elderberries
  have a very low proanthocyanidin to anthocyanin ratio. The proanthocyanidins found
  in those berries tend to be highly polymeric, with the majority of the proanthocyanidins
  containing more than ten monomeric units. However, raspberries, red currants, and
  pomegranates, only contain dimeric proanthocyanidins. The total amount of proanthocyanidins
  found in fresh berries is shown in Table 2.\n\nBerries distinguish themselves from
  other fruits by being particularly rich in a further type of flavonoids, namely
  the flavylium cation-derived anthocyanidins. Anthocyanidins share the same biosynthetic
  precursors, as proanthocyanidins, namely leucoanthocyanidins, which, themselves,
  derive from dihydroflavonols. Anthocyanidins are responsible for the bright red
  and purple colour of berries. In nature, anthocyanidins are normally found as glycosylated
  complexes referred to as anthocyanins. The six aglycon anthocyanidin units found
  in berry-derived anthocyanins include cyanidin 17, malvidin 18, delphinidin 19,
  peonidin 20, petunidin 21, and pelargonidin 22. The sugar moieties, which may be
  acylated by a range of aromatic or aliphatic acids, include glucose, sophorose,
  rutinose, rhamnose, galactose, arabinose, and xylose. Anthocyanidins are potent
  ROS scavengers and apoptosis inducers. The ROS scavenging activity of anthocyanins
  is due to the presence of hydroxyl groups in position 3 of the C ring and in the
  positions 3′, 4′, and 5′ of the B ring. In addition to ROS scavenging, the activation
  of detoxifying enzymes and of gluthatione-related endogenous anti-oxidants accounts
  for the strong anti-oxidant potential of anthocyanidins. Anthocyanidins also inhibit
  the transcriptional activity of NF-κB and the expression of VEGF, and induce the
  expression of the anti-angiogenic protein TIMP-2. Finally, some anthocyanins possess
  the unusual ability to induce erythroid cell differentiation in leukaemia cells.
  The total amount of anthocyanidins present in fresh berry extracts is the single
  most important factor influencing the anti-oxidant and anti-cancer potential of
  the extracts. Amongst the anthocyanidins, non-acetylated monoglycolsylated molecules
  tend to be the most bioactive ones. Urinary recovery tests have shown that the bioavailability
  of anthocyanidins is greatly affected by the level of glycosylation of the molecules.
  As a matter of fact, the aglycone units are unstable in the small intestine and
  in the colon and rely on the glycone units for structural stabilty in the small
  intestine, and to be absorbed into the blood stream as intact molecules. Unlike
  other flavonoids, anthocyanidins exist as a balanced combination of four different
  forms, and the proportion in which each form is present depends on the acidity of
  the chemical environment. The red-coloured flavylium cation is only predominant
  at pH ;2\\. In more alkaline environments, the three remaining forms, which consist
  of a blue quinoidal base, a colourless carbinol pseudobase, and a colourless chalcone
  pseudobase form prevail. In the small intestine, the carbinol pseudobase predominates.
  On average, 40 % of the anthocyanin intake is recovered in ileal fluid. Anthocyanins
  can be absorbed into blood plasma as intact molecules or as methylated or glucuronidated
  derivatives, but the level of absorption tends to be very low. The uptake into the
  plasma occurs within minutes after the oral intake of the berry extracts. The presence
  of anthocyanins in the blood stream is generally very short-lived, and after 6 h,
  no traces of anthocyanins can be found in either blood plasma or urine samples.
  This observation supports the hypotheses that the plasma uptake of anthocyanins
  is, in general, very poor. Other explanations for the low level of recovery of anthocyanins
  in plasma and urine samples include the fact that anthocyanins can be stored in
  various tissues throughout the body, including the brain, the eyes, and the liver,
  and the possibility that anthocyanins potentially present in the plasma and urine
  might be overlooked for being in their colorless carbinol pseudobase form, rather
  than in their intensely colored red flavylium form. Anthocyanins that reach the
  large intestine are hydrolyzed by the intestinal microflora. The resulting anthocyanidin
  aglycones are unstable and rapidly metabolized to phenolic acids, which can penetrate
  into the blood stream. Cyanidin 17 is metabolized into the phenolic acid protocatechuic
  acid 23, while malvidin 18 is metabolized into syringic acid 24, delphinidin 19
  into gallic acid 25, peonidin 20 into vanillic acid 26, pentunidin 21 into 3-methoxy-4,5-dihydroxybenzoic
  acid 27, and pelargonidin 22 into 4-hydroxybenzoic acid 28. Pyranoanthocyanins,
  which result from the fermentation of anthocyanins in wine and in non-sterilized
  berry juices account for a high bioavailability of anti-oxidants from these beverages.\n\nIn
  vitro assays have shown that the anthocyanidin aglycones cyanidin 17, delphinidin
  19, and petunidin 21 inhibit the phosphorylation of MAPK1/2, JNK1/2, and ERK1/2
  by binding to and inhibiting the kinases Raf1 and MAP2K1 upstream of them. Subsequently,
  17, 19, and 21 inhibit the activation of NF-κB and AP-1, thereby suppressing the
  expression of COX-2 and the secretion of prostaglandin E2 in various cell types.
  The binding of 17, 19, and 21 to the kinases Raf1 and MAP2K1 is dependent on the
  presence of the ortho-dihydroxyphenyl structure on the B-ring of the the anthocyanidins,
  as neither of the anthocyanidins malvidin 18, peonidin 20, and pelargonidin 22 possesses
  the latter biological property. The binding of 17, 19, and 21 to the kinases Raf1
  and MAP2K1 has also been shown to be non-competitive with ATP. Delphinidin 19 induces
  G2/M cell cycle arrest in prostate cancer. Malvidin 18, delphinidin 19, and their
  glycosidic counterparts induce apoptosis by inhibiting NF-κB, by down-regulating
  Bcl-2, and by increasing the expression of Bax and of caspases 3 and 9. The cyanidin
  17 glycosides cyanidin-3-glucoside 29, cyanidin-3-rutinoside 30, cyanidin-3-(2(G)-xylosylrutinoside)
  31, and cyanidin-3O-sophoroside 32 are potent anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and
  pro-apoptotic agents. 29, 30, 31, and 32 inhibit the activation of AP-1 and of NF-κB
  by targeting the PI-3K/Akt and JNK MAPK signaling cascades. Cyanidin-3-glucoside
  29 and cyanidin-3-rutinoside 30 have also been shown to act as anti-angiogenic agents
  by down-regulating MMP-2, and by enhancing the production of TIMP-2 in human lung
  cancer cells. Açai berries, which are by far the strongest anti-oxidants amongst
  the all the berries described in the present paper, possess as major anthocyanins
  cyanidin-3-glucoside 29, cyanidin-3-rutinoside 30, delphinidin-3-(6″-acetoyl)glucoside
  33, peonidin-3-rutinoside 34, and peonidin-3-(6″-malonylglucoside) 35. The major
  anthocyanins found in blueberries are delphinidin-3-galactoside 36, petunidin-3-glucoside
  37, and malvidin-3-arabinoside 38. Blackberries and red raspberries contain primarily
  cyanidin glucosides. The major anthocyanins found in black raspberries include cyanidin-3-glucoside
  29, cyanidin-3-rutinoside 30, cyanidin-3-(2(G)-xylosylrutinoside) 31, and cyanidin-3-sophoroside
  32. Black currants are characterized by rutinosides and glucosides of cyanidin 17
  `and of delphinidin 19, while red currants contain primarily cyanidin diglycosides.
  The major anthocyanins found in cranberries are cyanidin galactosides and arabinosides.
  Elderberries contain primarily cyanidin-3-glucoside 29 and cyanidin-3-sambubioside
  39. Other anthocyanins found in elderberries include cyanidin-3-rhamnoglucoside
  40, cyanidin-3-xyloglucoside 41, cyanidin-3,5-diglucoside 42, and cyanidin-3-sambubioside-5-glucoside
  43. Gooseberries contain cyanidin-3-glucoside 29, cyanidin-3-rutinoside 30, peonidin-3-rutinoside
  34 peonidin-3-glucoside 44, and cyanidin-3-xyloside 45. Gooseberries also contain
  the aromatic acylated anthocyanins cyanin-3-O-β-(6″-E-caffeoylglucopyranoside) 46
  and 3-O-β-(6″-E-p-coumaroylglucopyranoside) 47. Mulberries, which are used as medicinal
  food in China, contain glucosides and rutinosides of cyanidin 17 and of pelargonidin
  22. Pomegranates are particularly rich in cyanidin-, delphinidin-, and pelargonidin-3-glucoside
  and 3,5-diglucoside, and strawberries contain predominantly pelargonidin glycosides.\n\n\n\nEllagitannins
  are hydrolysable tannin polymers. They consist of a central glycine unit esterified
  to aglycone units. Ellagitannins are strong anti-oxidants. They also stimulate apoptosis
  and inhibit NF-κB, inflammation, angiogenesis, and prostate cancer cell growth.
  SAR studies have shown that the anti-oxidant properties of ellagitannins increase
  with the level of polymerization, but decreases with the level of glycosylation.
  Large polyphenolic polymers contain a high number of hydroxy functions that can
  donate hydrogen atoms and support unpaired electrons. Ellagitannins are subjected
  to acid hydrolysis in the stomach and in the small intestine, releasing the phenol
  ellagic acid 49, which is rapidly absorbed into blood plasma. Ellagitannins and
  ellagic acid 49 reaching the large intestine are metabolized to urolithin C 50 and
  D 51, Urolithin C 50 and D 51 are further metabolized to urolithin A 52 and B 53,
  which undergo modifications such as glucuronidation and methylation before being
  excreted in urine. The resulting metabolites urolithin A-3-O-glucuronide 54, urolithin
  B-3-O-glucuronide 55, 3,8-O-dimethylellagic acid-2-O-glucuronide 56, and methylated
  urolithin B appear in urine samples within 12–36 h following berry intake. The chemical
  transformations of ellagitannins in the gastrointestinal tract are illustrated in
  Fig. 5. Concerning bioavailibilty, urolithins circulate in plasma as glucuronide
  and sulfate conjugates at concentrations in the range of 0.2–20 μM. Moreover a recent
  report quantified and determined 11 phenolic acids in rat plasma, urine, and liver
  by ultraperformance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.\n\nWhile blueberries
  and cranberries contain predominantly condensed tannins, raspberries, strawberries,
  blackberries raspberries, strawberries, and pomegranates contain primarily hydrolyzable
  tannins. The major ellagitannin found in berries is sanguiin-H6 57. Along with sanguiin-H6
  57, raspberries and blackberries contain sanguiin-H10 58 and lambertianin C 59 as
  major ellagitannins. Pomegranates also contain large amounts of pedunculagin 60,
  granatin B 61, strictinin A 62, corilagin 63, punicalin 64, and punicalagin 65,
  which is the largest polyphenol in terms of molecular weight known to date. In vitro
  assays have shown that sanguiin-H6 57, pedunculagin 60 and strictinin A 62 are cytotoxic
  to melanoma cells, and that punicalagin 65 inhibits the proliferation of human oral,
  colon, and prostate tumor cells. Sanguiin-H6 57, pedunculagin 60 and strictinin
  A 62 have been shown to possess pro-apoptotic effects on cancer cells. Sanguiin-H6
  57 also prevents angiogenesis in endothelial cells by interfering with the binding
  of VEGF to its receptor on the cellular membrane. Punicalin 64 and punicalagin 65
  arrest the cell cycle at the S phase by downregulating cyclin-dependent kinases
  A and B1 which are required for the progress from the S phase to G2/M phases. Granatin
  B 61, strictinin A 62, corilagin 63, punicalin 64, and punicalagin 65 decrease the
  production of NO, COX-2, and PGE2. Corilagin 63 also inhibits the activation of
  NF-κB and the production of the cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 in activated microglia.
  Noteworthy, sanguiin H-6 57 is the only raspberry-derived ellagitannin recovered
  in the ileal fluid, with a 23 % recovery rate. Sanguiin H-10 58 and lambertianin
  C 59 are too large to be absorbed in the small intestine. Despite its size, punicalagin
  65 can, to a certain extend, be absorbed into plasma, but the bulk of consumed punicalagin
  65 is, like the majority of ellagitannins, hydrolysed to ellagic acid 49 in the
  small intestine and catalyzed to urolithins in the large intestine.\n\n\n\nAlthough
  they are often overlooked when assessing the nutraceutical benefits of berries and
  of fruits and vegetables in general, phenolic acids and urolithins are present in
  large quantities in the human body following berry consumption, as they are the
  principal metabolites resulting from the degradation of flavonoids and ellagitannins
  in the gastrointestinal tract. Furthermore, phenolic acids and urolithins tend to
  be readily absorbed into the blood plasma, and to prevail in the body for relatively
  long periods of time as a consequence of enterohepatic recirculation.\n\nPhenolic
  acids found in edible berries or metabolized from berry-derived flavonoids or ellagitannins
  by the human gut microflora include the benzoic acids protocatechuic acid 23, syringic
  acid 24, gallic acid 25, vanillic acid 26, 3-methoxy-4,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid 27,
  p-hydroxybenzoic acid 28, ellagic acid 49, and salicylic acid 66, and the cinnamic
  acids p-coumaric acid 67, caffeic acid 68, ferulic acid 69, and sinapic acid 70.
  Gallic acid 25 and ellagic acid 49 arrest the cell cycle at the S phase by downregulating
  cyclin-dependent kinases A and B1 which are required for the progress from S to
  G2/M. Gallic acid 25 is one of the major compounds responsible for the anti-angiogenic
  activity of black raspberries. Ellagic acid 49 induces apoptosis in cancer cells.
  The molecular targets of ellagic acid 49 are p53, JNK, p38, cdk2, NF-κB, COX-2,
  VEGF, MMP-2 and 9. Ferulic acid 69 induces cell cycle arrest at the G2/M interface
  in oral cancer cell lines in vitro and inhibits the development of malignant oral
  tumors in vivo in rats. A daily low-dose consumption of aspirin, a prodrug to salicylic
  acid 66 has been recognized as an effective chemopreventive treatment against colon
  cancer, which is the second most frequent malignancy in affluent countries. A long-term
  consumption of low-dose aspirin has also been shown to reduce the risk of oesophagal
  and gastric cancer and of cardiovascular diseases, although patients with a high
  risk of gastrointestinal complications should avoid a long-term consumption of aspirin
  or should be concomitantly treated with prostaglandin receptor antagonists or with
  proton pump inhibitors due to the risk of mucosal injury in the upper gastrointestinal
  tract. Ellagic acid 49 is the metabolite resulting from the degradation of ellagitannins
  by the gut microflora. Ellagic acid 49 is also found in nature in strawberries,
  blackberries, and raspberries. Strawberries and black raspeberries are also rich
  in ferulic acid 69. Black currants are rich in p-coumaric acid 67. Red currants
  are rich in p-hydroxybenzoic acid 28, p-coumaric acid 67, caffeic acid 68, and ferulic
  acid 69. Cranberries contain p-hydroxybenzoic acid 28, vanillic acid 26, p-coumaric
  acid 67, ferulic acid 69, caffeic acid 68, and sinapic acid 70. Pomegranate is rich
  in caffeic acid 68, punicic acid 75, and corilagin 63. Compared to other berries,
  and to other fruits in general, black currants contain a high level of salicylic
  acid 66.\n\nThe ellagitannin metabolites urolithins C 50 and D 51, start to appear
  in significant amounts in the jejunum, which is the middle section of the small
  intestine. Subsequent modifications along the gastrointestinal tract lead to the
  formation of urolithin A 52 and B 53. Urolithin A 52 has a lower anti-oxidant potential
  than its metabolic precursors ellagic acid 49, urolithins C 50 and D 51, but the
  anti-oxidant activity is expressed over a long period of time, as the compound remains
  in systemic circulation for up to 72 h. Urolithin B 53 does not possess any anti-oxidant
  activity, but both urolithin A 52 and B 53 inhibit cancer development and inflammation
  through interferences with the MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways. Furthermore, urolithin
  A 52 possesses prebiotic properties. The absorbtion capacity of urolithins into
  the blood stream increases with the molecules’ lipophilicity. Urolithin A-3-O-glucuronide
  54 and urolithin B-3-O-glucuronide 55 are readily absorbed, urolithin 3,8-O-dimethylellagic
  acid-2-O-glucuronide 56 is only found in traces in the circulation. Substantial
  quantities of urolithin A 52 derivatives and glucuronides and methyl glucuronides
  of ellagic acid have been found in bile, indicating high levels of hepatic metabolism
  and active enterohepatic circulation.\n\n\n\nStilbenoids are phytoallexin sproduced
  by plants in response of physical or chemical stress, pathogenic infection, or injury.
  The stilbene resveratrol 6 commonly found in grapes, blueberries, cranberries, and
  mulberries inhibits NF-κB and AP-1 activation and the expression of COX-2. The inhibition
  of NF-κB by resveratrol 6 results in part from the natural products ability to activate
  the deacetylase sirtuin 1 which is known to deacetylate and deactivate NF-κB. Resveratrol
  6 acts as a pro-apoptotic agent by down-regulating pro-survival proteins such as
  Bcl-xL and by up-regulating the pro-apoptotic proteins p53, Bax, and caspase 3(Balkwill
  and Mantovani 2001; Khan et al. 2010). Resveratrol 6 also arrests cancer cells at
  the G1/S checkpoint by modulating cyclins D and E.\n\n\n\nThe pentacyclic triterpenoid
  ursolic acid 71 and its cis and trans p-hydroxycinnamate esters are found in the
  waxy outer layer of various types of berries, and in cranberries and blueberries
  in particular. Ursolic acid 71 inhibit the growth, proliferation, and mutation of
  a wide range of cancer cell lines by inhibiting the activity of cylcooxygenases,
  by inducing G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis through the activation of caspase
  3, and by decreasing the expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9.\n\nThe triterpenoid lupeol
  72 found in strawberries and grapes has potent anti-oxidant, anti-proliferative,
  anti-mutagenic, and anti-inflammatory properties: PARP cleavage induction, increase
  in FADD protein and Fas receptor expression, upregulation of Bax, caspases 3 and
  9, downregulation of Bcl-2; also G2/M cell cycle arrest. Lupeol 72 also induces
  cell differentiation in human leukaemia cells. Other molecular targets of lupeol
  72 include NF-κB, COX-2, Fas induction, PARP expression induction, Bcl-2, Akt, cyclin
  D1/D2, Ras, iNOS. The carotenoids β-carotene 73 and lutein 74 are abundant in most
  types of berries. A physiological concentrations, these carotenoids act as anti-oxidants
  and contribute towards the inhibition of breast and colon cancer proliferation.\n\n\n\nThe
  polyunsaturated fatty acid punicic acid 75 is a major component of pomegranate seeds.
  Punicic acid 75 is a potent inhibitor of prostate cancer in vitro, and it has anti-obesity
  properties in mice.\n\n\n\nBerries are also very rich in vitamin C, which is a potent
  anti-oxidant and plays a role in iron absorption, and hormone synthesis, and in
  folic acid, which acts as an anti-cancer agent by maintaining DNA stability. Cranberries,
  blueberries, and black currants have the highest concentrations of vitamin C.\n\nBerries
  are also rich sources of vitamin A, B9, C and E, as well as calcium, and selenium.
  Vitamin C and E and selenium are anti-oxidants. Vitamin E induces cell-cycle arrest
  in cancer cells.\n\n\n\nBerries are rich sources of bioactive nutrients, and essentially
  experimental data suggest that the regular consumption of berries or of berry-derived
  natural products can help prevent and treat a wide range of pathologies, including
  cancer and inflammatory diseases. These assumptions are nevertheless largely based
  on in vitro data obtained with complex extracts/polyphenols/phenolic acids/terpenoids
  etc. It has to be clearly stated that results cannot readily be extrapolated human
  beings consuming berries or related products.\n\nMoreover, we have presented the
  chemistry of the major compounds found in edible berries and berry-like fruits,
  and the bioactivities of the compounds have been described. With their abundance
  in anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory activities, berries could be regarded as good
  food sources to follow Hippocrates’ advise to “Let food be thy medicine, and medicine
  be thy food”. While epidemiological data are not yet available for all types of
  berries, it is generally accepted that two cups of unsweetened berry juice a day
  represent the required daily amount of berry consumption in order to benefit from
  the healthy properties of berries described in the present review. It is noteworthy
  that the chemical composition can vary based on the environmental conditions during
  the cultivation and storage, and based on the ripeness of the fruits. Kalt et al.
  recommend storing berries at or slightly above room temperature to maintain a high
  anti-oxidant power. Del Rio et al. have reported that the coingestion of berry-derived
  anthocyanidins with phytic acid found in the hulls of seeds, nuts, and grains increase
  the bioavailability of anthocyanins by a factor of 6, while the simultaneous consumption
  of milk reduces the anti-oxidant potential of berries. Synergy between the different
  natural products found in berries has been observed, and hence it is more beneficial
  to consume berries whole, rather than purified compounds isolated from the berries.\n\n\n\nResearch
