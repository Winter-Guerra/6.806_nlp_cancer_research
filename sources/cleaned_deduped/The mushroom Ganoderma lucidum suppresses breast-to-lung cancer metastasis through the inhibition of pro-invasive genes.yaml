text: "\n\nBreast cancer metastasis is one of the major reasons for the high morbidity
  and mortality of breast cancer patients. In spite of surgical interventions, chemotherapy,
  radiation therapy and targeted therapy, some patients are considering alternative
  therapies with herbal/natural products. In the present study, we evaluated a well-characterized
  extract from the medicinal mushroom Ganoderma lucidum  for its affects on tumor
  growth and breast-to-lung cancer metastasis. MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells
  were implanted into the mammary fat pads of nude mice. GLE  was administered to
  the mice by an oral gavage for 4 weeks, and tumor size was measured using microcalipers.
  Lung metastases were evaluated by hematoxylin and eosin  staining. Gene expression
  in MDA-MB-231 cells was determined by DNA microarray analysis and confirmed by quantitative
  PCR. Identified genes were silenced by siRNA, and cell migration was determined
  in Boyden chambers and by wound-healing assay. Although an oral administration of
  GLE only slightly suppressed the growth of large tumors, the same treatment significantly
  inhibited the number of breast-to-lung cancer metastases. GLE also downregulated
  the expression of genes associated with invasive behavior  in MDA-MB-231 cells.
  Gene silencing of HRAS, VIL2, S100A4, I2PP2A and FN1 by siRNA suppressed migration
  of MDA-MB231 cells. Our study suggests that an oral administration of GLE can inhibit
  breast-to-lung cancer metastases through the downregulation of genes responsible
  for cell invasiveness. The anti-metastatic benefits of GLE warrant further clinical
  studies.\n\nBreast cancer is a leading cause of cancer death in women worldwide
  and the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States. The high mortality
  among cancer patients is associated with cancer metastasis, which contributes to
  more than 90% of cancer-related fatalities. Although chemotherapy, radiation therapy
  and targeted therapy can directly kill cancer cells, some cancer cells are resistant
  to these treatments and can further proliferate and metastasize. Therefore, identifying
  new drugs/compounds with an anti-invasive potential would help to control the metastatic
  properties of cancer cells. Interestingly, some natural/dietary compounds show the
  potential to suppress proliferation and invasiveness of cancer cells.\n\nOne of
  the dietary compounds not widely consumed in the United States is the mushroom.
  However, two recent epidemiological studies from Asia suggest that mushrooms can
  actually protect against breast cancer. Ganoderma lucidum is a mushroom recognized
  by traditional Chinese medicine  and commonly used in the forms of tea, powder and
  dietary supplements. The botanical characterization, description and therapeutic
  effects of G. lucidum are summarized in the American Herbal Pharmacopoeia. We have
  previously shown that G. lucidum extract  containing triterpenes and polysaccharides,
  suppresses the invasive behavior of breast cancer cells. Experimental in vivo studies
  demonstrated the inhibition of liver and lung metastases of lung carcinoma cells
  by triterpenoid fraction of G. lucidum and isolated ganoderic acid Me  and T, respectively.
  In addition, 2.5% of the antlered form of G. lucidum in the diet suppressed the
  number of lung metastases of lung cancer cells. Oral administration of a lucidenic
  acid-rich G. lucidum extract inhibited lung and liver metastases of human hepatoma
  cells in a xenograft model.\n\nIn the present study, we evaluated the effect of
  GLE on the growth and breast-to-lung cancer metastasis in an orthotopic xenograft
  model without significantly influencing primary tumor growth. Our data suggest that
  an oral application of GLE inhibits lung metastases and can be used for the natural/alternative
  therapy of invasive breast cancers.\n\nHuman breast cancer cells  were obtained
  from ATCC. MDA-MB-231 cells were maintained in DMEM medium supplemented with penicillin,
  streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum. Media and supplements were from Invitrogen.
  FBS was obtained from Hyclone. GLE was supplied by Pharmanex. GLE is a standardized
  Ganoderma lucidum extract containing 6% triterpenes and 13.5% polysaccharides; the
  extraction procedure was previously described. GLE stock solution was prepared in
  water for animal experiments or in DMSO for cell culture experiments. siRNA reagents,
  scrambled siRNA and siRNA for HRAS, VIL2, S100A4, MCAM, I2PP2A, and FN1 were from
  Santa Cruz Biotechnology.\n\nMDA-MB-231 cells  in 0.2 ml DMEM were injected into
  the mammary fat pad of 6- to 7-week-old female nude mice, as previously described.
  Three to four weeks after implantation with tumor cells, when tumors reached approximately
  600 mm3, the animals were randomized into control and treatment groups. The animals
  received intragastrical gavage every other day with water  or 100 mg GLE/kg of body
  weight  for an additional 28 days. The tumor size was measured using calipers, and
  the tumor volume was estimated by the formula: tumor volume  = W2  L  1/2, where
  L is the length and W is the width of the tumor. At the end of the experiment, the
  lungs were harvested and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin at 4C for 24 h.
  Tissue was then processed overnight and embedded in paraffin. Five-micrometer sections
  were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and the metastases in whole sections of
  stained lungs from 6 animals in each of the control and GLE-treatment groups were
  evaluated under a light microscope by 3 independent observers. The protocol for
  animal experiments was approved by the Animal Research Committee at IU Health Methodist
  Hospital according to the NIH guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.\n\nMDA-MB-231
  cells were treated with GLE  for 24 h and total RNA was isolated with RNAeasy. This
  RNA was used for the evaluation of gene expression with Oligo GEArray Human Tumor
  Metastasis Microarray according to the manufacturers protocol.\n\nThe quantitative
  real-time polymerase chain reaction  was performed using the ABI Prism 7900HT Fast
  Real-Time PCR System  according to the manufacturers instructions. MDA-MB-231 cells
  were treated with GLE  for 24 h and total RNA was isolated using RNAeasy. The RNA
  samples were reverse transcribed into cDNA  using random hexamer primers and the
  TaqMan reverse transcription kit. The cDNA  was subjected to qPCR analysis in quadruplicate
  using forward and reverse primers, the TaqMan Universal Master Mix, and a probe
  \ in fast optical 96-well plates. The data were analyzed using the ABI Prism 7900
  relative quantification  study software. We used primers for HRAS, VIL2, S100A4,
  MCAM, I2PP2A and FN1 genes with the -actin gene as the internal control. The gene
  expressions levels were normalized to -actin and are presented as arbitrary fold
  changes compared between the control and GLE-treated cells.\n\nMDA-MB-231 cells
  \ were seeded into 6-well plates and incubated at 37C in a 5% CO2 incubator until
  7080% confluent. The cells were transfected with control RNA  or siRNA according
  to the manufacturers protocol. Gene silencing by siRNA in MDA-MB-231 cells was evaluated
  by western blot analysis.\n\nMDA-MB-231 cells were treated with GLE  for 24 h. Whole
  cell extracts were isolated as described, membrane extracts were isolated by using
  a ProteoExtract subcellular proteome extraction kit  according to the manufacturers
  protocol. Protein expression was detected by western blot analysis with the corresponding
  antibodies anti-HRAS, anti-ezrin, anti-S100A4, anti-MCAM, anti-SET, anti-fibronectin,
  and anti--actin, anti-GAPDH, and anti--integrin 3 as loading controls  as previously
  described. Reactive bands were visualized with a respective secondary antibody via
  an enhanced chemiluminescence  detection system.\n\nThe effect of gene silencing
  on cell migration of MDA-MB-231 cells was assessed in Boyden chambers as previously
  described. After fixing and staining, the number of migrating cells was counted
  from at least four random fields using a microscope at 20 magnification. Data points
  represent the average SD of individual filters within one representative experiment
  repeated at least twice.\n\nMDA-MB-231 cells were untransfected  or transfected
  with scRNA or siRNAs. After 24 h the cells were scratched using a 200-l pipette
  tip and further incubated for an additional 24 h. The extent of wound healing was
  observed microscopically and recorded.\n\nData are represented as mean  SD and were
  analyzed using SigmaPlot 11.2.\n\nAlthough previous studies demonstrated the suppression
  of tumor growth and the inhibition of metastases by purified Ganoderma lucidum compounds
  or extracts in experimental animals, these studies usually started the treatment
  with small tumors close to 100 mm3 in size. Since not all breast cancers are diagnosed
  in the early stages, we were interested to learn whether GLE inhibits the growth
  and metastases of larger tumors. Highly invasive human breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231
  were injected into the mammary fat pads of mice, and an oral application of GLE
  \ was started when the tumors reached 600 mm3. GLE treatment for 4 weeks had modest
  inhibitory effects on tumor size and weight. Since we have previously shown that
  GLE inhibits invasive behavior in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells in vitro,
  we further studied whether GLE inhibits breast-to-lung cancer metastases in vivo.
  Although we did not observe changes in the tumor volumes in the control and GLE-treatment
  groups in MDA-MB-231 cell-derived tumors, we found statistically non-significant
  inhibition of tumor growth by GLE. This effect was caused by the necrosis since
  both control and GLE-treated tumors had necrotic central regions that were filled
  with fluid. However, our data show significant inhibition of breast-to-lung cancer
  metastases from 33.915.2 in control to 10.25.4 in GLE-treated animals.  \n\nIn order
  to identify which pro-metastatic genes are affected in MDA-MB-231 cells by GLE,
  MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with vehicle or GLE  and gene expression was analyzed
  by Oligo GEArray Human Tumor Metastasis Microarray as described in Materials and
  methods. GLE treatment downregulated the expression of HRAS, VIL2, S100A4, MCAM,
  I2PP2A and FN1 genes by more than 20%, which we further confirmed by qRT-PCR.  \n\nTo
  confirm that genes targeted by GLE are indeed responsible for the invasiveness of
  MDA-MB-231 cells, we silenced these genes by siRNA to evaluate whether this genetic
  manipulation suppressed the migration of MDA-MB-231 cells. Increased expression
  of the oncogene HRAS is associated with aggressive breast cancer, and an overexpression
  of HRAS induces cell migration and an invasive phenotype in breast epithelial cells.
  Not surprisingly, HRAS silencing suppressed the migration of MDA-MB-231 cells. In
  agreement with a previous study by Li et al  on the silencing of VIL2, coding ezrin,
  a cytoplasmic peripheral membrane protein that plays a key role in cell motility,
  slightly suppressed the migration of MDA-MB-231 cells. The S100A4 protein is overexpressed
  in highly metastatic cancers and controls cell migration through different pathways.
  Gene silencing of S100A4 also suppressed the migration of MDA-MB-231 cells. At the
  time of our manuscript preparation, Wang et al  demonstrated that gene silencing
  of S100A4 inhibited cell migration and invasion as well as lung metastases of MDA-MB-231
  cells in mice. Although the original studies suggested that MCAM  is a tumor suppressor
  in breast carcinomas, CD146 expression was later associated with a poor prognosis
  in breast cancer patients and increased motility of breast cancer cells. However,
  gene silencing of MCAM did not affect the migration of MDA-MB-231 cells. The SET
  protein  inhibits protein phosphatase 2A, which regulates oncoproteins  in various
  cancers. Therefore, the inhibition of I2PP2A is therapeutically important, and,
  as recently demonstrated, targeting SET suppresses lung tumors. As seen in Fig.
  3E, gene silencing of I2PP2A also suppressed SET protein expression and the inhibited
  migration of MDA-MB-231 cells. The fibronectin 1 protein  controls cell adhesion
  and migration, and FN1 overexpression was detected in breast cancer metastases.
  Gene silencing of FN1 resulted in the downregulation of FN1 expression and inhibited
  the migration of MDA-MB-231 cells. Since cell migration is a complex process and
  is controlled by more than one protein, we evaluated whether the gene silencing
  of all genes whose expression was downregulated by GLE treatment inhibited cell
  migration to a larger extent than the silencing of these genes individually. MDA-MB-231
  cells were transfected with a mixture of siRNAs for HRAS, VIL2, S100A4, MCAM, I2PP2A
  and FN1, and cell migration was evaluated. As seen in Fig. 4A, transfection of pooled
  siRNAs suppressed migration in the wound-healing assay as well as in the cell migration
  assay in Boyden chambers, suggesting that targeting a pool of pro-invasive genes
  is a better strategy than targeting only one gene. On the other hand, the expression
  of ezrin, S100A4, MCAM, SET and fibronectin was downregulated by pooled siRNA, whereas
  the expression of HRAS was not affected. In addition, pooled siRNA and GLE treatment
  demonstrated the strongest inhibition of fibronectin expression, suggesting that
  fibronectin is the major target for inhibiting cell invasiveness. Although our data
  with pooled siRNA generally confirms our previous results with the isolated siRNA,
  it is possible that pooled siRNA could also inhibit some of the single siRNA since
  HRAS-siRNA downregulated expression of the HRAS protein, whereas pooled siRNA does
  not. In addition, GLE treatment suppressed expression of different pro-invasive
  proteins with different potency, further suggesting specific targeting at transcriptional
  or posttranslational levels. These questions will be addressed in our future studies.
  \ \n\nIn our present study, we found that GLE downregulates the expression of a
  set of genes  that are different from the previously published genes that mediate
  breast-to-lung cancer metastasis. One of the reasons for this difference is that
  in our experiments we originally evaluated the effect of GLE on the expression of
  selected pro-metastatic genes by using Oligo GEArray, which does not cover all genes.
  Moreover, the breast-to-lung metastatic genes identified by Minn et al  were overexpressed
  in the lung-metastatic derivative of MDA-MB-231 but not in the parental MDA-MB-231
  cells used in our study. Therefore, a different set of genes should be targeted
  during the progression of metastatic breast cancer. In addition, our study was performed
  with only one cell line of highly metastatic triple negative breast cancer cells,
  MDA-MB-231 and different genes can be targeted in other metastatic breast cancers.\n\nIn
  conclusion, the chemically characterized dietary mushroom extract GLE inhibits breast-to-lung
  cancer metastasis of highly invasive human breast cancer cells implanted in mouse
  mammary tissue. In addition, GLE suppresses the expression of genes involved in
  the invasive behavior of cancer cells. Further preclinical studies evaluating GLE
  activity in the prevention of breast cancer metastasis are warranted.\n\nThis study
