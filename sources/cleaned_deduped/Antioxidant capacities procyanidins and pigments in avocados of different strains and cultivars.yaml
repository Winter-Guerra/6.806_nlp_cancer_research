  Avocado  is an important tropical fruit, but little is known about their antioxidant
  capacities and phytochemical composition. The objective of this research was to
  determine antioxidant capacities, total phenolic content and identify and quantify
  major antioxidant compounds in avocados of different strains and cultivars. Ripe
  Florida avocados from seven cultivars  of West Indian or Guatemalan strains were
  separated into seeds, peels and pulp, and freeze dried. Hass avocado of Mexican
  strain was chosen for comparison. Samples were extracted with acetone/water/acetic
  acid solvent and analysed using the Folin-Ciocalteu assay for total phenolic content.
  Antioxidant capacities were determined by oxygen radical absorbance capacity  and
  DPPH assays. Procyanidins were identified and quantified using HPLC-MSn. Antioxidant
  pigments  were estimated spectrophotometrically. For all varieties, seeds contained
  the highest antioxidant capacities, phenolic content, and procyanidins, whereas
  the pulp had the lowest. Procyanidins, including catechin, epicatechin, A- and B-type
  dimers, A- and B-type trimers, tetramers, pentamers and hexamers, were identified
  in peels and seeds using normal-phase HPLC-ESI-MSn. Antioxidant capacities, phenolic
  contents and procyanidins in avocados were highly correlated, suggesting that procyanidins
  were the major phenolic compounds that contributed to antioxidant capacities. Carotenoids
  and chlorophylls were found to be concentrated in avocado peels but did not correlate
  with antioxidant capacities. This study suggested that avocado seeds and peels,
  industrial wastes of avocado processing, can be exploited as source of antioxidants.'
