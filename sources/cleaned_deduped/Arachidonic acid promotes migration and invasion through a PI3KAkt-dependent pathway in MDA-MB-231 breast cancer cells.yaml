  Arachidonic acid is a common dietary n−6 cis polyunsaturated fatty acid that under
  physiological conditions is present in an esterified form in cell membrane phospholipids,
  however it might be present in the extracellular microenvironment. AA and its metabolites
  mediate FAK activation, adhesion and migration in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells.
  However, it remains to be investigated whether AA promotes invasion and the signal
  transduction pathways involved in migration and invasion. Here, we demonstrate that
  AA induces Akt2 activation and invasion in MDA-MB-231 cells. Akt2 activation requires
  the activity of Src, EGFR, and PIK3, whereas migration and invasion require Akt,
  PI3K, EGFR and metalloproteinases activity. Moreover, AA also induces NFÎºB-DNA
  binding activity through a PI3K and Akt-dependent pathway. Our findings demonstrate,
  for the first time, that Akt/PI3K and EGFR pathways mediate migration and invasion
  induced by AA in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells.'
