  adds important evidence to aid in understanding the role of phytochemicals based
  on data from in vivo and chemical assays of extrusion processed purple potato and
  pea flours. A cellular antioxidant activity assay could provide biologically relevant
  information on bioactive compounds in raw as well as processed food products. The
  objective of this study was to investigate the complete phytochemical profiles,
  antioxidant activity, cellular antioxidant activity, and their contribution to bioactivity
  in purple potato flour, dry pea flour, raw formulations, and extrusion cooked products
  prepared with the above ingredients. The free fraction of extracts contributed 68,
  64, and 88% to total phenolics, total antioxidant activity, and total flavonoids,
  respectively, in purple potato flour. Similarly, extracts in the free fraction contributed
  87, 86, and 64% to total phenolics, total antioxidant activity, and total flavonoids,
  respectively, in dry pea flour. The amount of total phenolics and total flavonoids
  in purple potato flour and the antioxidant activity of PPF and DPF were comparable
  to published data. However, a higher amount in the total flavonoids and lower in
  the total phenolics of DPF were observed. Caffeic, p-coumaric, and ferulic acids
  were mostly observed in the bound extracts of raw formulations as in the extrudates,
  whereas chlorogenic acid was predominant in the free extracts. The extruded products
  had significantly higher content of total phenolics, ORAC antioxidant activity,
  and flavonoids, compared to the raw formulations. Extrusion processing increased
  the cellular antioxidant activity of the extrudates prepared from 35:65 and 50:50
  PPF/DPF of ingredients compared with control raw formulations in a dose-dependent
  manner. Increase of PPF significantly increased the cellular antioxidant activity
  of 35–50% PPF formulations.\n\n\n\npurple potato flour; dry pea flour; extrusion;
  phenolics; antioxidant activity; flavonoids; cellular antioxidant activity; bioactivity\n\n\n\nProcessed
  fruits and vegetables are generally believed to have less naturally occurring antioxidants
  than fresh products, resulting in reduced health benefits. One of the major reasons
  for this belief has been the measurement of antioxidant activity focused solely
  on vitamin C levels in foods as an indicator for health benefits of processed products.(1-4)
  However, Eberhardt et al.(5) observed that vitamin C contributed ;0.4% to the total
  antioxidant activity in apples, indicating the importance of other phytochemicals
  toward total antioxidant activity in foods. Antioxidant compounds derived from fruits
  and vegetables act to prevent the formation of reactive oxygen, nitrogen, hydroxyl,
  and lipid species either by scavenging free radicals or by repairing or removing
  damaged molecules.(6) Bioactive phytochemicals are proposed to prevent chronic diseases
  such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and certain forms of cancers.(7-10) Bioactive
  phytochemicals exist in free, soluble-conjugated, and bound forms.(11) Bound phytochemicals,
  mostly in cell wall materials, are difficult to digest in the upper gastrointestine
  and may be digested by bacteria in the colon to provide health benefits and reduce
  the risk of colon cancer.(12) Only a small portion of flavonoids absorbed across
  the intestinal membrane are partly transformed to glucuronides and sulfates; however,
  the majority of the flavonoids are degraded by intestinal microflora. Several phenolic
  acids are produced by bacterial enzymes utilizing hydrolysis, dehydroxylation, cleavage
  of the heterocyclic oxygen-containing ring, and decarboxylation of flavonoids. Reabsorption
  of these phenolic acids increases the antioxidant protection with their radical
  scavenging ability.(13)\n\nMany researchers have reviewed and documented the contributions
  of phenolic compounds including anthocyanins, individual phenolic acids, and carotenoids
  present in white and colored potato skin and flesh to antioxidant activity.(14-16)
  Wounding, boiling, baking, drum-drying, freeze-drying, and microwave cooking of
  white and colored potatoes had different effects on the total phenolic content.(17-19)
  Potato protein hydrolysate inhibited lipid oxidation of beef patties by scavenging
  free radicals,(20) and potato peel extracts retarded oxidation in radiation-processed
  lamb meat.(21)\n\nLegumes such as dry peas are rich sources of protein and dietary
  fiber. Consumption of legumes helps prevent osteoporosis(22) and certain cancers(23)
  and reduces body lipid accumulation.(24) Various effects of thermally processed
  legumes on antioxidant activity, phenolic content, and potential health benefits
  were reported.(25, 26) The combination of purple potato and dry pea may produce
  healthy snack foods incorporating natural color along with positive effects on human
  health. Limited studies have been done on the effect of processing on formulations
  of potatoes and legumes or to characterize the phytochemical profiles of their mixes,
  and their contributions to antioxidant activities. Metabolism, absorption, and bioactivity
  of health-beneficial phytochemicals could be improved by combining protein and individual
  phytochemicals. Liu(9) reported that the additive and synergistic effects of biologically
  active compounds from fruits, vegetables, and whole grains are responsible for health
  benefits.\n\nThe objective of this study was to investigate the complete phytochemical
  profiles that exist in free and bound forms, and their contribution to the total
  antioxidant activity in the raw ingredients, raw formulations, and extrusion cooked
  products prepared with the above ingredients. The bioactivity of phytochemicals
  in the raw and processed samples was also determined using the cellular antioxidant
  activity assay.(37) The cellular antioxidant activity assay has been used to assess
  antioxidants, foods, and dietary supplements due to its capability to consider cell
  uptake, distribution, and efficiency of protection against peroxyl radicals under
  physiological conditions.\n\n\n\n\nFolin–Ciocalteu reagents, sodium nitrite, catechin,
  sodium borohydride, chloranil, vanillin, and gallic acid were purchased from Sigma.
  Sodium hydroxide, hexane, aluminum chloride, and acetonitrile were obtained from
  Fisher Scientific, whereas ethyl acetate, trifluoroacetic acid, methanol, hydrochloric
  acid, acetic acid, acetone, and ethanol were of analytical grade and were purchased
  from Mallinckrodt Chemicals. Tetrahydrofuran and aluminum chloride were purchased
  from Fisher Scientific.\n\n\n‘Purple Majesty’ potatoes were peeled, sliced, blanched,
  and drum-dried in the Food Processing Pilot Plant of Washington State University.
  Split dry peas and drum-dried potato flakes were pin-milled to produce flours at
  the Processed Foods Research Unit, Western Regional Research Center, USDA, Albany,
  CA. Raw formulations were prepared from purple potato flour and dry pea flour at
  selected concentrations. Extruded products were prepared from PPF, DPF, and their
  formulations using a corotating twin-screw extruder at 45 g/min feed rate, 300 rpm
  screw speed, 17% feed moisture, and barrel zones set at 80/100/110/120/130 °C. The
  extrudates were milled to flour using a coffee grinder and stored at −80 °C until
  further use. The flours for routine analysis were stored at −20 °C.\n\n\nFree phenolic
  compounds in the ingredients, raw formulations, or extruded flours were extracted
  using the method reported by our research group in previous manuscript.(27, 28)
  Briefly, 1–2 g of flour sample was homogenized with 50 mL of 80% chilled acetone
  for 10 min using a high-speed homogenizer. After centrifugation of homogenized flour
  at 2500g for 5 min, the supernatant was removed and extraction was repeated once
  more. Supernatants were pooled, evaporated at 45 °C to dryness, and reconstituted
  with water to a final volume of 10 mL. The extracts were stored at −75 °C until
  use.\n\n\nBound phenolics in the ingredients, raw formulations, or extruded flours
  were extracted using the method reported by our research group in previous manuscripts.(11,
  28, 29) Briefly, 1–2 g flour samples were extracted twice with 80% chilled acetone
  with centrifugation at 2500g for 5 min, and the supernatant was discarded after
  each extraction. The residues were digested with 20 mL of 2 M sodium hydroxide at
  room temperature for 1 h with shaking under nitrogen gas. The mixture was neutralized
  with an appropriate amount of hydrochloric acid and extracted with hexane to remove
  lipids. The final solution was extracted five times with ethyl acetate. The ethyl
  acetate fraction was evaporated to dryness. The resulting residues were reconstituted
  in 10 mL of water and stored at −75 °C until use.\n\n\nThe total phenolics of each
  extract were determined using methods previously described by Singleton et al.(30)
  and modified in our laboratory.(31, 32) Briefly, 400 μL of deionized water and 100
  μL of a known dilution of the extract or standard solution were added to a test
  tube. Folin–Ciocalteu reagents was added to the solution and allowed to react for
  6 min. Then, 1 mL of 7% sodium carbonate solution and 800 μL of deionized water
  were added to the test tubes, and the mixture was mixed well. The color developed
  for 90 min at room temperature, and absorbance was read at 760 nm using a MRX II
  DYNEX spectrophotometer. The measurements for free, bound, and total phenolics were
  compared with a standard curve of prepared gallic acid solutions and expressed as
  micrograms of gallic acid equivalents per gram dry weight sample ± SD for triplicate
  extracts.\n\n\nChlorogenic, caffeic, p-coumaric, and ferulic acids in sample extracts
  were quantified using a reverse phase HPLC procedure employing a Supelcosil LC-18-DB,
  150 mm × 4.6 mm, 3 mm, column as reported previously.(33) Briefly, isocratic elution
  was conducted with 20% acetonitrile in water adjusted to pH 2 with trifluoroacetic
  acid, at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min, delivered using a Waters 515 HPLC pump. A Waters
  2487 dual-wavelength absorbance detector was used for UV detection of analytes at
  280 nm. Data signals were acquired and processed on a PC running Waters Millennium
  software, version 3.2. The retention times of the standards, chlorogenic, caffeic,
  p-coumaric, and ferulic acids, were 3.3, 4.7, 7.4, and 8.4 min, respectively. The
  phenolic acid concentrations of sample extracts were extrapolated from the pure
  phenolic acid standard curves. Twenty microliter injections were made in each run,
  and areas were used for all calculations. The selected individual peaks were identified
  by the retention times and co-injection of the pure standards. The method was validated
  by the recovery of chlorogenic acid. The percentage recovery for chlorogenic acid
  was 96.5 ± 6.22.\n\n\nThe total flavonoid contents of the samples were determined
  using the method of sodium borohydride/chloronil total flavonoid assay with modifications.(34)
  The stored sample extracts for total phenolic analysis were thawed and added to
  test tubes, then dried at 45 °C under nitrogen gas, and reconstituted in 1 mL of
  THF/EtOH. Catechin standards were prepared fresh each day before use in 1 mL of
  THF/EtOH. Each test tube with 1 mL of sample solution or 1 mL of catechin standard
  solution had 0.5 mL of 50 mM NaBH4 solution and 0.5 mL of 74.56 mM AlCl3 solution
  added and was then shaken in an orbital shaker for 30 min at room temperature. Then
  an additional 0.5 mL of NaBH4 solution was added to each test tube with continual
  shaking for another 30 min at room temperature. Cold acetic acid solution was added
  to each test tube, and the solutions were shaken in an orbital shaker in the dark
  for 15 min after thorough mixing. Then, 1 mL of 20 mM chloranil was added to each
  tube, which was heated at 95 °C under shaking for 60 min in a reciprocal shaking
  bath. The temperature in the reciprocal shaking bath was maintained using glycerin.
  The reaction solutions were cooled using tap water, and the final volume was brought
  to 4 mL using methanol. Then, 1 mL of 1052 mM vanillin was added to each tube, followed
  by mixing. Concentrated HCl was added to each tube, and the reaction solutions were
  kept in the dark for 15 min after thorough mixing. Aliquots of the final reaction
  solutions were added to each well of a 96-well plate after centrifuging for 3 min
  at 2500g, and absorbances were measured at 490 nm using a MRX Microplate Reader
  with Revelation workstation. Total flavonoids were expressed as micrograms of catechin
  equivalents per gram of dry weight sample. Data were reported as the mean ± SD for
  three replicates.\n\n\nThe antioxidant activity of the samples were determined using
  the oxygen radical absorbance capacity assay described by Prior et al.(35) and modified
  in our laboratory.(36) Briefly, 20 μL of blank, Trolox standard, or sample extracts
  in 75 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, was added to triplicate wells in a
  black, clear-bottom, 96-well microplate. The triplicate samples were distributed
  throughout the microplate and were not placed side-by-side, to avoid any effect
  on readings due to location. In addition, no outside wells were used, as use of
  those wells results in greater variation. A volume of 200 μL of 0.96 μM fluorescein
  in working buffer was added to each well and incubated at 37 °C for 20 min, with
  intermittent shaking, before addition of 20 μL of freshly prepared 119 mM ABAP in
  working buffer using a 12-channel pipetter. The microplate was immediately inserted
  into a Fluoroskan Ascent FL plate reader at 37 °C. The decay of fluorescence at
  538 nm was measured with excitation at 485 nm every 4.5 min for 2.5 h. The area
  under the fluorescence versus time curve for the samples minus the area under the
  curve for the blank were calculated and compared to a standard curve of the area
  under the curve for 6.25, 12.5, 25, and 50 μM Trolox standards minus the area under
  the curve for blank. ORAC values were expressed as mean micromoles of Trolox equivalents
  per gram of dry weight sample ± SD for triplicate data.\n\n\nThe assay for CAA was
  performed following the procedures of Wolfe and Liu.(37) Briefly, HepG2 liver cancer
  cells from the passages of 5 and 7 were seeded at a density of 6 × 104 in 100 μL
  of complete growth medium per well on a 96-well microplate in a humidified 5% CO2
  incubator at 37 °C. The wells on the boundary of the microplate were filled with
  200 μL of PBS. Twenty-four hours after seeding, the growth medium was removed and
  the wells were washed with PBS. The wells were treated in triplicate with 100 μL
  of solutions containing different concentrations of antioxidant extracts plus 25
  μM DCFH-DA dissolved in antioxidant treatment media for 1 h at 37 °C. Then treatment
  media were removed, and wells were washed with 100 μL of PBS to remove extracellular
  residues. One hundred microliters of 600 μM ABAP in oxidant treatment medium was
  applied to all of the cells, and the microplate was immediately placed into a Fluoroskan
  Ascent FL plate reader at 37 °C. Emission was measured every 5 min for 1 h at 538
  nm after excitement at 485 nm. The blank wells contained cells treated with DCFH-DA,
  HBSS, and antioxidant extracts without ABAP, whereas the control wells contained
  cells treated with DCFH-DA, HBSS, and ABAP without antioxidant extracts.\n\nThe
  area under the curve for fluorescence versus time was integrated to calculate the
  CAA value at each concentration of the sample extracts aswhere ∫SA is the integrated
  area under the sample fluorescence versus time curve and ∫CA is the integrated area
  from the control curve. The median effective dose, that is, the dose required to
  give a 50% inhibition for sample extract, was determined from the median effective
  plot of log(fa/fu) versus log(dose), where fa is the fraction affected and fu is
  the fraction unaffected by the treatment. In the experiments, quercetin was used
  as a standard.\n\n\nAll results were reported as the mean ± SD for at least three
  analyses for each type of extraction, and each extract was analyzed in triplicate.
  Results were subjected to ANOVA, and significance differences between means were
  determined using Tukey’s multiple-comparison test run on SAS. Correlations among
  various parameters were also evaluated using Pearson’s correlation coefficient.\n\n\n\n\nThe
  phenolic contents of the ingredients, raw formulations, and extruded products were
  determined using the Folin–Ciocalteu method and expressed as μg GAE/g DW sample.
  Free, bound, and total phenolics in PPF were 2008 ± 118, 932 ± 66, and 2940 ± 183
  μg GAE/g DW sample, respectively. DPF had 366 ± 20, 55 ± 2, and 421 ± 19 μg GAE/g
  DW sample of free, bound, and total phenolics, respectively. The extruded products
  prepared from 35, 50, and 65% PPF had significantly higher free phenolic contents
  than their raw formulations. The bound phenolic contents of the extruded products
  prepared from 35, 50, and 65% PPF were significantly lower than their raw formulations.
  The total phenolic contents of the extruded products prepared from 35, 50, and 65%
  PPF were significantly higher than their raw formulations. Table 1 shows the percentage
  contributions of free and bound phenolics to the total phenolic content of raw ingredients
  and extruded products.\n\nFigure 1. Phenolic contents of ingredients, raw formulations,
  and extruded products prepared from purple potato flour and dry pea flour formulations.
  The selected formulations for preparing the extrudates contained x% of PPF and%
  of DPF. Bars with different letters are significantly different.\n\nTable 1. Percentage
  Contributions of Phytochemicals in Free and Bound Extracts of Ingredients, Raw Formulations,
  and Extruded Productsa to Total Phenolics, Total Antioxidant Activity, and Total
  Flavonoids  \n\n\n\n\n\nThe selected formulations for preparing the extrudates contained
  x% of PPF and% of DPF.\n\n\nThe flavonoid contents of the ingredients, raw formulations,
  and extruded products were determined using the SBC assay and were expressed as
  μg catechin eq/g DW sample. The free, bound, and total flavonoid contents of PPF
  were 5495 ± 42, 724 ± 23, and 6219 ± 417 μg catechin eq/g DW sample, respectively.
  The free, bound, and total flavonoid contents of DPF were 1305 ± 36, 731 ± 71, and
  2036 ± 72 μg catechin eq/g DW sample, respectively. The free flavonoid contents
  of the extruded products prepared from 35, 50, and 65% PPF were 2606 ± 220, 2929
  ± 153, and 3468 ± 64 μg catechin eq/g DW sample, respectively, and were significantly
  higher than their raw formulations. The extruded products prepared from 35, 50,
  and 65% PPF had significantly higher bound flavonoid contents than their raw samples.
  The total flavonoid content of the extruded products prepared from 35% PPF was significantly
  higher than its raw formulation. Similarly, the extruded products prepared from
  50 and 65% PPF were significantly higher flavonoid contents than their raw formulations.\n\nFigure
  2. Flavonoid contents of ingredients, raw formulations, and extruded products prepared
  from purple potato flour and dry pea flour formulations. The selected formulations
  for preparing the extrudates contained x% of PPF and% of DPF. Bars with different
  letters are significantly different.\n\n\nDetected individual phenolic acids present
  in the raw formulations and extruded products are presented in Table 2, expressed
  as μg/g DW sample. Chlorogenic acid was the prominent phenolic acid in free phytochemicals,
  whereas caffeic and p-coumaric acids were prominent in bound phytochemicals of the
  samples. Quantities of caffeic, p-coumaric, and ferulic acids were either less or
  not detected in free phytochemicals of the raw formulations and extruded products.
  Chlorogenic acids in the free and bound phytochemicals of the extruded products
  were 984–2967 and 574–609 μg/g DW sample, respectively, and were significantly higher
  than in their raw formulations. Extrusion of raw formulations significantly lowered
  the caffeic acid content, whereas processing increased the quantity of p-coumaric
  acid in the bound phytochemicals of all raw formulations except 35% PPF. Quantities
  of ferulic acids in the extruded products were also significantly higher than their
  raw formulations. Individual phenolic acids, except caffeic acid, in the total phytochemicals
  were significantly higher in the extruded products compared to their raw formulations.
  However, no significant difference was observed in the content of total p-coumaric
  acid in the extruded product prepared from 35% PPF , compared to its raw formulation.\n\nTable
  2. Quantities of Free, Bound, and Total Individual Phenolic Acids Present in Extracts
  of Ingredients and Dry Pea Flour), Raw Formulations, and Extruded Productsa  \n\n\n\n\n\nThe
  formulation contains x% of PPF and% of DPF. Values in each column with no letters
  in common are significantly different. Abbreviations: chloro, chlorogenic acid;
  p-coum, coumaric acid; ferul, ferulic acid; nd, not detected.\n\n\nThe total antioxidant
  activities of the ingredients, raw formulations, and extruded products were determined
  using the ORAC assay and expressed as μmol TE/g DW sample. The free, bound, and
  total ORAC values of PPF were 47.82 ± 1.66, 26.80 ± 0.89, and 74.62 ± 2.53 μmol
  TE/g DW sample, respectively. The free, bound, and total ORAC values of DPF samples
  were 8.86 ± 0.88, 1.43 ± 0.07, and 10.29 ± 0.92 μmol TE/g DW sample, respectively.
  The free ORAC values of extruded products prepared from 35, 50, and 65% PPF were
  significantly higher than those of their raw formulations. Conversely, the bound
  ORAC values of extruded products prepared from 35 and 65% PPF were significantly
  lower than those of their raw formulations. However, there was no significant difference
  in the ORAC values of bound phytochemicals in the extruded products prepared from
  50% PPF formulation compared to its raw formultion. The extruded products prepared
  from 35, 50, and 65% PPF had significantly higher ORAC values than those of their
  raw formulations.\n\nFigure 3. Antioxidant activity of ingredients, raw formulations,
  and extruded products prepared from purple potato flour and dry pea flour formulations.
  The selected formulations for preparing the extrudates contained x% of PPF and%
  of DPF. Bars with different letters are significantly different.\n\n\nThe CAA of
  the raw formulations and extruded products was quantified using the protocol of
  the CAA method and expressed as EC50 in mg/mL and CAA values in μmol quercetin equivalent/g
  DW sample. The EC50 value of PPF sample was 52.1 ± 4.0 mg/mL, whereas no CAA activity
  was detected in DPF sample. The EC50 values of the extruded product prepared from
  35% PPF and 50% PPF were significantly lower than those of their raw formulations.
  However, no significant difference in the EC50 values was observed between the raw
  and extruded products prepared from 65% PPF. Similarly, the CAA values of 35, 50,
  and 65% PPF raw formulations and extruded products followed the same trend as their
  EC50 values. The EC50 values of quercetin standard in all of the replicates were
  in the range of 3.35–4.5 mg/mL, which were similar to those reported by Wolfe and
  Liu.(37)\n\nFigure 4. Cellular antioxidant activity and EC50 value of ingredients,
  raw formulations, and extruded products prepared from purple potato flour and dry
  pea flour formulations. The selected formulations for preparing extrudates contained
  x% of PPF and% of DPF. Bars with different lower case letters are significantly
  different for CAA, whereas different upper case letters are significantly different
  for EC50.\n\n\nRelationships among total phenolics, total ORAC values, and CAA with
  individual phenolic acids and flavonoids in free and bound forms were determined
  using Pearson’s correlation coefficient. The free phenolic content was significantly
  correlated to total ORAC values and CAA values. Similar correlation patterns were
  observed between total phenolics and total ORAC values and CAA values. The free
  and total flavonoids were significantly correlated to total phenolics, ORAC, and
  CAA values. Among individual phenolic acids, free and total chlorogenic acid contents
  were significantly correlated to the total phenolics, ORAC, and CAA values. p-Coumaric
  and ferulic acids in the bound and total extracts significantly correlated to the
  total phenolics, ORAC, and CAA values. However, caffeic acid did not show any positive
  correlation with the total phenolics, ORAC, or CAA values. The total ORAC values
  were significantly correlated with CAA values.\n\nTable 3. Correlation Analysis
  of Phenolics, Antioxidant Activity, and Cellular Antioxidant Activity of Ingredients,
  Raw Formulations,a and Extruded Productb  \n\n\n\nThe formulations contain x% of
  purple potato flour and% of dry pea flour.\n\n\nExtruded products prepared from
  PPF and DPF formulations. Correlation coefficients were calculated as r2. Significant
  levels are given in the parentheses.\n\n\n\nPhytochemicals in food samples are present
  in both free and bound forms.(11, 12) Without accounting for bound phytochemicals,
  the total phytochemical content will be underestimated.(11) Therefore, studying
  free and bound phytochemicals provides a more accurate information on total phytochemicals
  and the contributions of free, soluble-conjugated, and bound to the total phenolics
  and their total antioxidant activity. The cellular antioxidant activity assay, used
  in this study, is a biologically relevant means to quantify the bioactivity of antioxidants
  in food products as it takes into consideration the cellular uptake, metabolism,
  and distribution of bioactive compounds in the cell.(37, 38) The values of cellular
  antioxidant activities of the samples were also evaluated using ORAC. This study
  was designed to determine the phytochemicals, their relationships, and contributions
  to total antioxidant activity in potato and dry pea flours, raw formulations, and
  extrusion cooked snack foods made from the raw formulations.\n\nOur study showed
  that majority of the phenolics in PPF and DPF were present in free rather than in
  bound form. The quantity of total phenolics in whole potato cultivars grown in the
  Andes Mountains of South America was in the range of 1120 − 12370 μg GAE/g DW sample,
  which is within the range of our study determined on flesh potato flour.(39) Results
  from a Colorado potato breeding program have shown that there was no difference
  in the total phenolic content between whole ‘Purple Majesty’ potato processed thru
  microwave cooking, boiling or baking compared to the unprocessed potatoes. In our
  study we determined that the extrudates obtained from flesh potato flour had higher
  concentration in total phenolics than raw formulations. This indicates that the
  type of cooking/processing have a significant effect on the phenolic content in
  the final product. Additionally, the type of potato cultivar may had also an effect
  on the reported result.(19) The percentage contribution of free phenolics to the
  total was 68%, whereas bound phenolics contributed 32% in potato flour. This is
  similar to the results of Chu et al.,(40) who reported the contributions of 60 and
  40% by free and bound phenolics, respectively, to the total phenolics in white potatoes
  with skin.(40) Therefore, the total phenolic contents reported in the previous literature
  may have been underestimated by not including the bound phenolics in the results
  of their study. Bound phenolics might be associated with the plant cell walls that
  survive upper gastrointestinal digestion and reach the colon, where most of them
  are released by intestinal microflora.(11, 12) The total phenolic content in DPF
  in the present study was 3–5-fold lower than in the reported literature.(25, 26)
  This could be due to use of previously milled flours compared to whole raw legumes
  by other researchers or different solvents for extraction of phenolic compounds.(41)
  Free phenolics in DPF contributed more to the total phenolics than bound ones. The
  raw formulations from potato and dry pea flours in selected concentrations had 69–84%
  free phenolics. Extrusion cooking of raw formulations increased the percentage contributions
  of free phenolics to the total and decreased the contributions from bound phenolics.
  Increase in the total phenolics in the extruded food products rather than the raw
  formulations could be due to breaking of conjugated phenolics into free phenolics
  and leaching of soluble fibers, proteins, and other nonphenolic soluble components
  such as mono-, di-, and oligosaccharides.(26) Han and Baik(26) reported a similar
  increase in the total phenolics of cooked and soaked chickpeas, yellow peas, green
  peas, and soybeans. However, in another paper, the total phenolics of cooked legumes
  were significantly reduced when compared to uncooked samples.(25)\n\nFree and bound
  phytochemicals in potato flour contributed 64 and 36%, respectively, to the total
  ORAC antioxidant activity, similar to their contributions to the total phenolics.
  The total ORAC value in potato flour was in the range of hydrophilic ORAC values
  of Andean potato cultivars.(39) The individual ORAC values of free and bound phytochemicals
  could not be compared due to limited information in the literature. The total ORAC
  value in DPF was comparable to that of reported in the literature(42) and had similar
  contributions from free and bound phytochemicals as was the case for total phenolics.
  Han and Baik(26) reported that free and bound phytochemicals contributed 68 and
  32%, respectively, to the total TEAC antioxidant activity of yellow peas. Processing
  of the all raw formulations using extrusion cooking significantly increased the
  total ORAC values of the extruded products. Increase in the total ORAC values followed
  the same pattern as in total phenolics of the extruded products. It was also observed
  that the ORAC values of bound phytochemicals significantly decreased and ORAC values
  of free phytochemicals increased in the extruded products. This phenomenon could
  be attributed to breaking of conjugated phytochemicals to release free phytochemicals,(31)
  prevention of enzymatic oxidation, and darker colors of the extruded products indicating
  formation of Maillard reaction products having antioxidant properties.(43) The ORAC
  values of processed green peas, yellow peas, and chickpeas were significantly increased
  after pressure boiling as compared to the raw legumes.(42) However, the FRAP values
  and DPPH antioxidant activity of legumes were decreased significantly by conventional
  and pressure boiling.(25, 42) Increases in the antioxidant activities of sweet corn,
  teas, and tomatoes with thermal processing were also reported.(4, 31, 44)\n\nQuantities
  of free flavonoids in potato and dry pea flours were significantly higher when compared
  to their bound flavonoids. The total flavonoids of both flours followed a similar
  pattern as free flavonoids, because of the larger contribution from free flavonoids.
  As we previously stated, other authors have also indicated that there is limited
  literature available to compare free, bound, and total flavonoids in colored potatoes.(45)
  The total flavonoids of DPF in our study were higher when compared to the reported
  total flavonoid contents of whole(41, 46) and dehulled yellow peas.(47) Quantities
  of free flavonoids increased after extrusion cooking of all the raw formulations.
  Interestingly, the contents of bound flavonoids were also significantly increased
  in the extruded products when compared to their raw formulations. Choi et al.(48)
  reported a significant increase of free flavonoids in shiitake mushrooms after heat
  treatment at 100 and 121 °C when compared to raw mushrooms. However, the investigators
  observed decreases in bound flavonoids after heat treatment. Increase in the flavonoid
  contents of the extrudates could be attributed to disruption of plant cell walls
  providing better extractability, breaking of chemical bonds of higher molecular
  weight polyphenols and forming soluble low molecular weight polyphenol compounds,
  and interconversion of flavonoids in different forms.(49) Variyar et al.(50) reported
  an increase in antioxidant potential of soybeans with the dose of γ-irradiation
  due to increased levels of genistin and degradation products of diadzein.\n\nPhenolic
  acids are sources of dietary phenols, which are linked to cellulose, lignin, and
  proteins through ester bonds. For example, chlorogenic acid has strong antioxidant
  activity and is already demonstrated to have several desirable effects on biochemical
  processes involved in carcinogenesis.(51)p-Coumaric acid was the major phenolic
  acid observed in potato flour, followed by chlorogenic, caffeic, and ferulic acids.
  Most of the p-coumaric and caffeic acids were observed in bound phenolic fraction,
  whereas chlorogenic acid was higher in free phenolics. Ferulic acid was observed
  only in bound phenolics. Adom and Liu reported that &gt;93% of ferulic acids were
  present in the bound form in corn, wheat, oats, and rice.(11) The content of free
  chlorogenic acid we reported in this study was similar to the total chlorogenic
  content in ‘Purple Majesty’ potatoes found in a Colorado potato breeding program.(19)
  Interestingly, our results demonstrated that bound phenolics contributed additional
  ∼20% of total chlorogenic acid, which was commonly underestimated in published literature.
  Lewis et al.(52) and Lachman et al.(53) reported in detail the presence of chlorogenic,
  caffeic, p-coumaric, ferulic, and other phenolic acids in colored potatoes. Chlorogenic
  acid, followed by ferulic and caffeic acids, was detected mostly in bound phenolics
  of DPF, whereas p-coumaric acid was not detected. Dry pea flour contained only chlorogenic
  acid in free phenolic fraction. The content of total chlorogenic acid in this study
  was higher when compared to the reported content of whole yellow peas.(25) The investigators,
  however, reported having p-coumaric acid along with chlorogenic and gallic acids
  in yellow peas. A multifold increase in chlorogenic acid in free and bound phenolic
  fractions of the formulations rather than raw ingredients could be due to the binding
  of an o-hydroxy phenolic group in chlorogenic acid to protein via the bidentate
  hydrogen bond.(54) The mechanism for binding of chlorogenic acid to sunflower proteins
  involved both hydrogen bonding and covalent linkages between oxidized phenolics
  and nucleophilic amino acid side chains, such as lysine and cysteine.(55) The behavior
  of caffeic acid in the raw formulations could also be due to the same mechanism
  of protein-bound phenolic interactions as chlorogenic acid. Quantities of chlorogenic
  acids in free and bound phenolics in all the extruded products were significantly
  higher when compared to their raw formulations. A similar pattern was observed in
  total chlorogenic acid contents of the extruded products. Xu and Chang(25) reported
  significant increases in gallic, chlorogenic, and total phenolic acids in yellow
  peas after pressure boiling. Significant decreases in caffeic acid in bound fraction
  and total phenolics were observed in the extruded products when compared to their
  raw formulations, whereas those decreases were not detected in free phenolics. A
  decrease in caffeic acid contents with exposure of potato strips to home processing
  conditions was reported.(56) Total p-coumaric and ferulic acid contents were increased
  in the extruded products compared to their raw formulations, mostly due to increases
  in their bound phenolics. However, caffeic, p-coumaric, and ferulic acids were not
  detected in free phenolic extractions of the extruded products. The undetected phenolic
  acids in the extrudates may be due to alkaline hydrolysis that partly or completely
  broke down original phenolic acids. Increases in the total chlorogenic, p-coumaric,
  and ferulic contents in the extruded products could be attributed to the alkaline
  hydrolysis of caffeic acid present in conjugated phenolics. The reasons for change
  in the individual phenolic acids during extrusion cooking could be explained according
  to Fleuriet and Macheix(57) as oxidative degradation of phenolic acids, breakdown
  of conjugated phenolics and release of free phenolic acids, and formation of complex
  phenolic acids.\n\nIncreases in the contents of chlorogenic, p-coumaric, and ferulic
  acids and low molecular phenolic acids from the breakdown of caffeic acid could
  have increased the total phenolics in the extruded products. Thermal decomposition
  of caffeic acid generated compounds such as tetraoxygenated phenylinadan isomers
  with higher antioxidant activity than caffeic acid.(58) Analysis of individual phenolic
  acids suggested that the breakdown of higher polyphenols and formation of novel
  compounds after processing could have increased the total phenolics as well as antioxidant
  activity. Significant positive correlations among individual phenolic acids except
  caffeic acid to the total phenolics and total ORAC antioxidant activity justify
  these assumptions. Increases in the total phenolics after processing and a strong
  correlation with ORAC antioxidant activity showed that phenolics were mostly responsible
  for the chemical antioxidant activity in the extruded products.\n\nThe bioactivity
  of phytochemicals in free phytochemical extracts in the ingredients, raw formulations,
  and extruded products was studied using the CAA assay. Potato flour showed potent
  CAA with an EC50 of 52 mg/mL. Lower EC50 values indicate higher CAA. Dry pea flour
  had no measurable CAA. CAA were observed in all of the raw formulations and their
  extruded products. The extruded products prepared from 50% PPF had higher CAA and
  lower EC50 value among the extrudates and also had much higher CAA and lower EC50
  value than its raw formulation. The effect of extrusion on the products prepared
  from 65% PPF was not significantly different in EC50 or CAA values. Similar results
  were observed in the 35% PPF raw formulation; CAA values were increased in the extrudates
  when compared to its raw formulation. There was no specific pattern observed in
  EC50 values of the extruded products. It could be possible that products extruded
  from a 50% PPF raw formulation had a better composition of potato and dry pea flour
  for possible additive and synergistic effects of phytochemicals responsible for
  the higher CAA as suggested by Liu.(9) The CAA value of the extruded product from
  50% PPF formulation was comparable with those of plums and red grapes and higher
  than those of cherries, kiwifruit, mangoes, peaches, and pears.(36) The extruded
  products had higher CAA when compared to the raw formulations, which may be due
  to extrusion processing increasing the amount of bioaccessible phytochemicals as
  well as increased cellular uptake of those phytochemicals.\n\nIn summary, a comprehensive
  study on the contributions of free and bound phytochemicals to the total phenolics,
  flavonoids, ORAC antioxidant activity, and CAA in ‘Purple Majesty’ potato and dry
  pea flours is presented in this study. Raw formulations of PPF and DPF and their
  extrudates were analyzed in detail with regard to changes in individual phenolic
  acids, bound and free phytochemicals, and their contributions to ORAC antioxidant
  activities after extrusion processing. In most of the extruded products, the total
  phenolics, flavonoids, and ORAC values increased after processing. The CAA were
  observed in potato flour, raw formulations, and extruded products. Extrusion processing
  improved CAA of 50% PPF raw formulation. Measuring the antioxidant activity using
  the CAA assay in the extruded food products is important for assessing the bioactivity
  of processed foods, because it is more biologically relevant than chemical antioxidant
  assays.(37) Further studies on the antioxidant activities of individual phytochemicals
  and changes during processing are needed to understand the detailed mechanism of
  the breakage and formation of total phytochemicals and their contribution to bioactivity.\n\n\n\nWe
