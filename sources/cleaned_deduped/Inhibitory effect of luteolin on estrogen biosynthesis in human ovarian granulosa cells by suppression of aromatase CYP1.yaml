  an important strategy in the treatment of breast cancer. Several dietary flavonoids
  show aromatase inhibitory activity, but their tissue specificity and mechanism remain
  unclear. This study found that the dietary flavonoid luteolin potently inhibited
  estrogen biosynthesis in a dose- and time-dependent manner in KGN cells derived
  from human ovarian granulosa cells, the major source of estrogens in premenopausal
  women. Luteolin decreased aromatase mRNA and protein expression in KGN cells. Luteolin
  also promoted aromatase protein degradation and inhibited estrogen biosynthesis
  in aromatase-expressing HEK293A cells, but had no effect on recombinant expressed
  aromatase. Estrogen biosynthesis in KGN cells was inhibited with differing potencies
  by extracts of onion and bird chili and by four other dietary flavonoids: kaempferol,
  quercetin, myricetin, and isorhamnetin. The present study suggests that luteolin
  inhibits estrogen biosynthesis by decreasing aromatase expression and destabilizing
  aromatase protein, and it warrants further investigation as a potential treatment
  for estrogen-dependent cancers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstrogen is a sex steroid hormone and
  plays a pivotal role in the regulation of many biological processes. Estrogen is
  known to induce physiological responses in the reproductive tract, mammary tissue,
  and the pituitary gland and to affect nonreproductive processes such as bone formation
  and cardiovascular health.(1) The biological actions of estrogen are mediated through
  nuclear and membrane estrogen receptors, which are expressed in a variety of cell
  types and mediate the genomic and nongenomic effects of estrogen.(1) Numerous factors
  have been implicated in the increased incidence of breast cancer in humans, including
  the Western-style diet and environmental endocrine-disrupting chemicals, which are
  thought to alter the production, metabolism, and action of estrogen.(2, 3) Some
  ER antagonists such as tamoxifen and fulvestrant have been widely used to treat
  hormone-responsive breast cancer, but their clinical use is often limited by side
  effects including vaginal bleeding, thromboembolism, and increased risk of endometrial
  cancer.(4) Fruits and vegetables are rich in flavonoids such as genistein. These
  compounds are structurally similar to estrogen and are well-known for their cancer-preventive
  effects, which are partly mediated through competitive inhibition of the ER. However,
  flavonoids also exhibit estrogenic activity that can enhance cell proliferation
  in the uterus and the mammary gland.(5, 6) Thus, reduction of estrogen levels by
  means of inhibition of endogenous estrogen biosynthesis becomes another option in
  the prevention and treatment of estrogen-mediated carcinogenesis.(7)\n\nIn humans,
  estrogen biosynthesis occurs at a number of different sites, with the major sites
  being the granulosa cells of the ovary in premenopausal women and stromal cells
  of the adipose tissue in postmenopausal women.(8) In women, estrogen is also produced
  locally at other sites, including the brain, bone, and breast. Estrogen biosynthesis
  is catalyzed by aromatase, which binds the C19 androgenic steroid substrate and
  catalyzes successive reactions to form the phenolic A ring characteristic of estrogens.(9)
  In humans, aromatase expression at various sites is regulated by tissue-specific
  promoters by alternative splicing mechanisms.(10) In the ovary and testes, aromatase
  expression is controlled by promoter II, which binds the transcription factors cAMP-response
  element binding protein and steroidogenic factor-1. Aromatase expression in the
  gonads is thus regulated by gonadotropins through stimulation of cAMP generation.(11)
  Aromatase inhibitors such as anastrozole, letrozole, and exemestane have been developed
  for the treatment of hormone-dependent breast cancer in postmenopausal women, and
  they show superior efficacy to conventional antiestrogen receptor drugs such as
  tamoxifen.(12) However, the estrogen deprivation that results from inhibition of
  aromatase activity leads to side effects such as increased risk for osteoporosis
  and cardiovascular disease.(13) Thus, there remains a need to discover and develop
  novel aromatase inhibitors that offer greater clinical efficacy and fewer side effects
  than the currently available drugs.\n\nSeveral natural flavonoids are known to be
  potent aromatase inhibitors; this activity partly contributes to the importance
  of certain vegetables and fruits in the daily diet to decrease the risk of chronic
  diseases.(14-16) Luteolin is one of the most common flavonoids present in edible
  and medicinal plants. Preclinical studies have shown that this compound possesses
  a variety of pharmacological activities, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory,
  antimicrobial, and anticancer activities.(17) Accumulating evidence suggests that
  luteolin could be developed as an anticancer agent to sensitize some tumor cells,
  such as tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand-sensitive or -resistant
  cancer cells and hepatoma cells, for apoptosis.(18, 19) Luteolin has also been proposed
  to be a promising adjuvant for multiple sclerosis therapy due to its additive effects
  with interferon-β in modulating the immune responses of peripheral blood mononuclear
  cells isolated from multiple sclerosis patients.(20) Dietary sources of luteolin
  include celery, green peppers, bird chili, onion, parsley, cabbages, and apple skin.
  Although luteolin is found to inhibit estrogen biosynthesis in breast cancer MCF-7
  cells, preadipocyte cells and placental choriocarcinoma JEG-3 cells, its tissue
  specificity and mechanism of action remain poorly understood.(21-23)\n\nIn this
  study, we investigated the effect and mechanism of luteolin on estrogen biosynthesis
  in human ovarian granulosa-like KGN cells. We also compared the effects of luteolin
  on estrogen biosynthesis with those of other commonly consumed flavonoids and vegetables.\n\n\n\n\nLuteolin,
  quercetin, kaempferol, myricetin, and isorhamnetin were purchased from Must Biotechnology
  Co., Ltd.. Testosterone, formestane, forskolin, and protease inhibitor cocktail
  were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co.. Bird chili and onion were purchased from
  a market near the institute and were identified by one of the authors. The pCMV6-aromatase
  plasmid was purchased from OriGene, and the pSV-β-galactosidase plasmid was purchased
  from Promega.\n\n\nHuman ovarian granulosa-like KGN cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s
  modified Eagle medium/Ham’s F-12 nutrient mix medium supplemented with 5% fetal
  bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere.
  Human embryonic kidney 293A cells were cultured at 37 °C in DMEM supplemented with
  10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin. For the transient transfections,
  subconfluent HEK293A cells grown in 24-well plates were cotransfected with 0.5 μg
  of pCMV6-aromatase plasmid and 0.3 μg of pSV-β-galactosidase plasmid using Trans-EZ
  transfection reagent according to the the manufacturer’s protocol. Aromatase activity
  was normalized to β-galactosidase activity to allow for differences in transfection
  efficiency.\n\n\nKGN cells were seeded into 96-well plates DMEM/F-12 medium at 37
  °C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. Compounds were then added to the cells, and
  the plates were incubated for a further 24 h. Alamar Blue reagent was added, and
  the fluorescence intensities were measured using a Verioskan Flash Multimode Reader
  with excitation at 544 nm and emission at 590 nm. Cytotoxicity was defined as the
  ratio of the fluorescence intensity in test wells to that in solvent control wells.
  The assay was conducted three times in triplicate. The IC50 value was obtained by
  fitting dose–response data to a four-parametric logistic nonlinear regression model
  using GraphPad Prism 5.0 software.\n\n\nKGN cells or transiently transfected HEK293A
  cells were seeded in 24-well plates and cultured overnight. The next day, the medium
  was replaced with serum-free medium, and the cells were pretreated for 24 h with
  the test chemicals. Testosterone was then added to each well, and the cells were
  incubated for a further 24 h. At the end of this incubation, the culture supernatants
  were collected and stored at −20 °C. Levels of 17β-estradiol in the supernatants
  were quantified using a magnetic particle-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
  according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Optical densities were measured at
  550 nm using a Verioskan Flash Multimode Reader. Results were normalized to the
  total cellular protein content and were expressed as percentage 17β-estradiol production
  compared with the control samples. Protein determination was carried out with a
  bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit. For the calculation of the IC50 value of luteolin
  in inhibiting estrogen biosynthesis, various concentrations of luteolin were used
  to treat KGN cells for 24 h. Testosterone was then added to each well, and the cells
  were incubated for a further 24 h. The IC50 value was obtained by fitting dose–response
  data to a four-parametric logistic nonlinear regression model using GraphPad Prism
  5.0 software.\n\n\nAn in vitro recombinant expressed aromatase activity assay was
  conducted as described previously with minor modifications.(24, 25) In brief, the
  test compounds were preincubated with an NADPH regenerating system for 10 min at
  37 °C before 50 μL of the enzyme and substrate mixture was added. The reaction mixture
  was then incubated for 2 h at 37 °C to allow the aromatase to generate the product
  and then quenched with 37.5 μL of 2 N NaOH. The mixture was then shaken for 5 min
  and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C to enhance the noise/background ratio. The fluorescence
  intensity was measured at 485 nm and 530 nm. Three independent experiments were
  performed in duplicate.\n\n\nCells cultured in 60 mm dishes were lysed with RIPA
  lysis buffer supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail. The protein concentration
  was determined by using a BCA protein assay kit. Aliquots of total cell lysates
  were mixed in loading buffer, boiled for 5 min, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Proteins
  were blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% bovine
  serum albumin and then incubated at 4 °C overnight with rabbit anti-human aromatase
  monoclonal antibody or rabbit anti-human GAPDH monoclonal antibody. Membranes were
  then incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary
  antibody and developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system. The
  intensity of each signal was determined by a computer image analysis system.\n\n\nTotal
  cellular RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
  The purity of extracted RNA was determined by examining the ratio of the absorbance
  at 260 and 280 nm using a Verioskan Flash Multimode Reader. The value of 1.8–2.0
  for A260/A280 indicates that the RNA is pure. The concentration of extracted RNA
  was determined by examining the absorbance at 260 nm. An A260 reading of 1.0 is
  univalent to 40 μg/mL of RNA. Total RNA was reverse-transcribed using SuperScript
  III rReverse Transcriptase with oligo(dT)18 primers. Equal amounts of cDNA were
  subjected to real-time quantitative PCR with the fluorescent dye SYBR Green I using
  a Chromo4 detection system. Reaction mixtures contained 12.5 μL of 2× TransStart
  Top Green qPCR SuperMix, 0.5 μL of each primer, and 1 μL of template cDNA. Sterile
  distilled water was added to a final volume of 25 μL. The primer pair for aromatase
  was 5′-ACCCTTCTGCGTCGTGTC-3′ and 5′-TCTGTGGAAATCCTGCGTCTT-3′, and that for GAPDH
  was 5′-CCACCCATGGCAAATTCCATGGCA-3′ and 5′-GGTGGACCTGACCTGCCGTCTAGA-3′. The thermal
  cycling conditions comprised an initial denaturation step at 95 °C for 10 s, followed
  by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 5 s, 54 °C for 15 s, and 72 °C for 15 s. Standard curves
  were established for each primer set, and both reference and target gene reactions
  were performed for each sample. The relative quantity of aromatase mRNA was calculated
  by the Δ method by using GAPDH amplified from the same sample as a reference.\n\n\nSamples
  of bird chili and onion were extracted and hydrolyzed to aglycons using a method
  modified from that of Miean et al.(26) Briefly, the fresh plants were cleaned, cut
  into pieces, and oven-dried at 50 °C. After the addition of 100 mL of 90% methanol
  containing 2 mg/mL tert-butylhydroquinoneTBHQ) and 10 mL of 6 M HCl, the extracts
  were mixed and refluxed at 100 °C for 2 h. The extracts were then filtered and concentrated
  to dryness by evaporation. The resultant flavonoid aglycons were quantified by reversed-phase
  HPLC on an Agilent C18 column using methanol/0.4% aqueous phosphoric acid as mobile
  phase and UV detection at the flow rate of 1 mL/min. The contents of luteolin and
  quercetin were calculated in triplicate for each sample on the basis of the external
  standard technique, from a standard curve of peak area versus concentration.\n\n\nStatistical
  analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism 5.0 software. Results are expressed
  as the mean ± standard deviation of individual values from three independent experiments.
  Data were compared by one-way ANOVA followed by Duncan’s multiple-range tests. P
  values of ;0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.\n\n\n\nEffect of
  Luteolin on Estrogen Biosynthesis in Human Ovarian Granulosa-like KGN Cells\n\nWe
  screened a chemical library consisting of 1431 natural products for small molecule
  modulators of estrogen biosynthesis(27) and identified luteolin, a natural flavone,
  as a potent inhibitor of estrogen biosynthesis in human granulosa-like KGN cells.
  The chemical structure of luteolin is given in Figure 1A. To examine the effect
  of luteolin on 17β-estradiol synthesis, KGN cells were incubated for 24 h with various
  concentrations of the test compounds followed by a further 24 h incubation with
  testosterone. As shown in Figure 1B, forskolin, which is an adenylate cyclase agonist
  and up-regulates aromatase expression by increasing intracellular cAMP levels and
  activating the protein kinase A/CREB pathway,(28) significantly increased the production
  of 17β-estradiol, whereas formestane, an aromatase inhibitor in clinical use for
  the treatment of breast cancer,(29) significantly inhibited 17β-estradiol biosynthesis.
  These results indicated that the established assay is suitable for examining the
  effect of bioactive compounds on estrogen biosynthesis. At 10 μM, luteolin significantly
  inhibited 17β-estradiol biosynthesis and had a more potent effect than 50 μM formestane.
  Luteolin at 10 μM also potently inhibited forskolin-induced 17β-estradiol biosynthesis.\n\nFigure

  structure of luteolin. KGN cells seeded in 24-well plates overnight were pretreated

  0.001 compared with the control; p &lt; 0.05 compared with FSK-treated cells.\n\nTo
  examine the effect of luteolin on estrogen biosynthesis in more detail, KGN cells
  were treated with luteolin at concentrations between 1 nM and 50 μM. As shown in
  Figure 1C, luteolin inhibited 17β-estradiol biosynthesis in a concentration-dependent
  manner, with a calculated IC50 value of 1.17 μM. Inhibition of 17β-estradiol biosynthesis
  by luteolin also exhibited a time-dependence manner. Inhibition of estrogen secretion
  was first evident at 12 h and was sustained until 96 h, when 17β-estradiol biosynthesis
  was inhibited by approximately 80% compared with the control. The tested concentrations
  of luteolin were not cytotoxic to KGN cells. These results indicate that luteolin
  could potently inhibit the biosynthesis of estrogen in human ovarian granulosa cells.\n\n\nKGN
  cells lack endogenous 17α-hydroxylase and cannot synthesize androgens or estrogens
  de novo.(30) Therefore, the 17β-estradiol measured in the culture supernatants was
  likely synthesized from the exogenously added testosterone through the action of
  aromatase—the only enzyme able to convert testosterone to 17β-estradiol. To determine
  whether luteolin inhibits 17β-estradiol biosynthesis through an effect on aromatase,
  we examined aromatase mRNA and protein levels in KGN cells treated with luteolin.
  As previously reported,(28, 31) we found that aromatase mRNA levels were significantly
  increased in cells treated by forskolin and significantly inhibited by formestane.
  Luteolin inhibited aromatase transcript levels by about 50% compared with the DMSO-treated
  control cells. Aromatase protein expression was also examined by Western blotting
  of KGN cell lysates following treatment with luteolin. Consistent with their effects
  on aromatase transcription, luteolin and formestane treatmenta of KGN cells reduced
  the expression of aromatase protein, whereas forskolin treatment increased the expression.
  These results indicate that luteolin inhibits estrogen biosynthesis in KGN cells
  by decreasing the expression of aromatase.\n\nFigure 2. Luteolin inhibits aromatase
  expression in KGN cells. KGN cells were pretreated for 24 h with 10 μM luteolin,
  10 μM forskolin, or 50 μM formestane. Aromatase mRNA was measured in total cellular
  RNA by using real-time qPCR. The results are expressed as fold increase relative
  to levels in untreated cells. GAPDH was used as an internal control. Cell lysates
  were immunoblotted with anti-aromatase or anti-GAPDH antibodies. Cont., DMSO control;
  FSK, 10 μM forskolin; FOR, 50 μM formestane; LUT, 10 μM luteolin. p &lt; 0.01 and
  p &lt; 0.001 compared with the control.\n\nEffect of Luteolin on Estrogen Biosynthesis
  in Aromatase-Expressing HEK293A Cells\n\nTo further confirm that luteolin exerts
  it inhibitory effect on estrogen biosynthesis by suppression of aromatase, HEK293A
  cells, which do not express aromatase, were transiently transfected with an aromatase
  expression vector and then treated with luteolin before the addition of testosterone.
  As shown in Figure 3A, 17β-estradiol biosynthesis by HEK293A cells was decreased
  by formestane and by luteolin in a concentration-dependent manner, consistent with
  the results in KGN cells. Furthermore, luteolin at 50 μM was found to significantly
  decrease aromatase protein expression in HEK293A cells compared with the DMSO- or
  formestane-treated cells. These results indicate that luteolin exerts it inhibitory
  effect on estrogen biosynthesis by promoting aromatase protein degradation.\n\nFigure
  3. Effect of luteolin on estrogen biosynthesis in aromatase-expressing HEK293A cells.
  HEK293A cells were cotransfected with pCMV6-aromatase and pSV-β-galactosidase expression
  plasmids. After 24 h, the cells were incubated with the indicated compounds for
  an additional 24 h, and then testosterone was added for a further 24 h. 17β-Estradiol
  concentrations in the culture supernatants were quantified by ELISA. Cell lysates
  were immunoblotted with anti-aromatase or anti-GAPDH antibodies. The quantitative
  results are depicted. Cont., DMSO control; FOR, 50 μM formestane; LUT, 50 μM luteolin;
  UT, untransfected HEK293A cells. p &lt; 0.05 and p &lt; 0.001 compared with the
  control.\n\n\nFlavonoids have long been found to act directly on aromatase to inhibit
  its catalytic activity.(14) To examine whether luteolin can directly inhibit aromatase
  activity, we conducted an in vitro assay by using recombinant expressed aromatase.
  As shown in Figure 4, formestane inhibited aromatase activity in a concentration-dependent
  manner, as reported.(24) Compared with that, luteolin had no effect on aromatase
  activity. These results indicate that luteolin does not directly inhibit aromatase
  activity as other active flavonoids generally do.\n\nFigure 4. Effect of luteolin
  on aromatase activity in vitro. An in vitro aromatase assay using recombinant expressed
  aromatase and dibenzylfluorescein as a substrate was conducted as described under
  Materials and Methods. Various concentrations of formestane and luteolin were added
  into the mixtures containing recombinant expressed aromatase and NADPH regenerating
  system, and fluorescence intensity induced by the aromatase-catalyzed dibenzylfluorescein
  hydrolysis was detected. Cont., DMSO control; FOR, formestane; LUT, luteolin. p
  &lt; 0.001 compared with the control.\n\n\nWe next examined the effects of several
  flavonoids found in commonly consumed vegetables and fruits on estrogen biosynthesis.
  First, KGN cells were treated with various concentrations of kaempferol, quercetin,
  myricetin, or isorhamnetin to test their effects on cell viability and to determine
  the optimal concentrations for estrogen biosynthesis assays. The chemical structures
  of these flavonoids are given in Figure 5A. As shown in Figure 5B, kaempferol inhibited
  17β-estradiol biosynthesis by KGN cells in a concentration-dependent manner, with
  approximately 30 and 50% inhibition following treatment with 10 and 50 μM kaempferol,
  respectively. Quercetin inhibited 17β-estradiol biosynthesis by up to 75% at a high
  concentration but increased 17β-estradiol biosynthesis slightly when added at low
  concentrations. Myricetin inhibited 17β-estradiol biosynthesis at a low concentration
  but had no effect at higher concentrations. In contrast, isorhamnetin had no effect
  on 17β-estradiol biosynthesis at any concentration examined. These results indicate
  that kaempferol and quercetin potently inhibit estrogen biosynthesis in KGN cells,
  whereas myricetin and isorhamnetin show only weak or no effects.\n\nFigure 5. Effects
  of dietary flavonoids on estrogen biosynthesis. presents the chemical structures
  of isorhamnetin, kaempferol, quercetin, and myricetin. KGN cells were seeded in
  24-well plates overnight and pretreated with the test compounds for 24 h. Testosterone
  was then added for a further 24 h, and 17β-estradiol concentrations in the culture
  supernatants were quantified using ELISA. Cont., DMSO control; Lut, luteolin; Iso,
  isorhamnetin; Kae, kaempferol; Que, quercetin; Myr, myricetin. p &lt; 0.05, p &lt;
  0.01, and p &lt; 0.001 compared with the control.\n\n\nOnion and bird chili are
  commonly consumed vegetables that are natural sources of luteolin; therefore, we
  next investigated whether extracts of onion or bird chili could affect estrogen
  biosynthesis. Quantification of quercetin and luteolin in the extracts indicated
  that onion contained high amounts of both quercetin and luteolin, whereas bird chili
  contained relatively low levels of both compounds. KGN cells were treated with various
  noncytotoxic concentrations of the extracts. As shown in Figure 6A, a high concentration
  of onion extract potently inhibited 17β-estradiol biosynthesis, whereas the bird
  chili extract had no such effect. We then examined the effect of onion extracts
  on aromatase expression in KGN cells. As shown in Figure 6B, onion extracts could
  significantly decrease aromatase protein expression. We also examined the effect
  of the vegetable extracts on estrogen biosynthesis in aromatase-expressing HEK293A
  cells. In contrast to the effects on KGN cells, both onion and bird chili extracts
  significantly inhibited 17β-estradiol biosynthesis in HEK293A cells in a concentration-dependent
  manner. These results indicate the onion and bird chili extracts can inhibit estrogen
  biosynthesis, and the inhibitory potency is concentration- and cell type-dependent.\n\nFigure
  6. Effects of onion and bird chili extracts on estrogen biosynthesis. KGN cells
  were seeded in 24-well plates overnight and pretreated with the plant extracts for
  24 h. Testosterone was then added for a further 24 h, and 17β-estradiol concentrations
  in the culture supernatants were quantified by ELISA. KGN cell lysates were immunoblotted
  with anti-aromatase or anti-GAPDH antibodies. HEK293A cells were cotransfected with
  pCMV6-aromatase and pSV-β-galactosidase expression plasmids. After 24 h, the cells
  were incubated with the plant extracts for an additional 24 h. Testosterone was
  then added for a further 24 h, and 17β-estradiol concentrations in the culture supernatants
  were quantified by ELISA. Cont., DMSO control; FSK, 10 μM forskolin; FOR, 50 μM

  Quantification of Quercetin and Luteolin in Onion and Bird Chili Extracts  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn
  the ovary, a major tissue for estrogen biosynthesis in premenopausal women, aromatase
  expression is regulated through a follicle-stimulating hormone-mediated cAMP pathway.(28)
  In the present study, we found luteolin could significantly decrease aromatase mRNA
  expression in KGN cells derived from the ovary. This is consistent with an observation
  in MCF-7 breast cancer cells that luteolin inhibits AP-1 binding in the I.3/II promoter
  region of aromatase and reduces aromatase mRNA expression.(21) In KGN cells, aromatase
  expression is mainly controlled by promoter II; thus, it is possible that luteolin
  inhibits aromatase expression in these cells by similar mechanism a to that in MCF-7
  cells. Luteolin has been shown to decrease intracellular cAMP levels and inhibit
  melanin production in B16 melanoma cells treated with α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone,(32)
  further indicating that luteolin may modulate the cAMP pathway to decrease aromatase
  transcription in KGN cells. Exemestane, an aromatase inhibitor used clinically,
  has been shown to promote aromatase degradation through the ubiquitin/26S proteasome
  pathway in aromatase-overexpressing MCF-7 cells without effect on the aromatase
  mRNA expression.(33) Similar to this, we found that luteolin significantly promoted
  aromatase degradation in aromatase-transfected HEK293A cells, in which the expression
  of aromatase was driven by a constitutive CMV promoter. Luteolin is not a general
  gene expression inhibitor and has no effect on CMV promoter-driven gene transcription,(19,
  34) so it may directly change the aromatase stability at the protein level. Luteolin
  promotes the X-linked inhibitor of apopotosis protein ubiquitination and proteasomal
  degradation by inhibition of protein kinase C.(18) Thus, it will be of great interest
  to investigate whether luteolin and exemestane promote aromatase degradation by
  the same mechanism and whether PKC is a novel regulator for aromatase ubiquitination
  and proteasomal degradation. No direct inhibitory effect of luteolin on recombinant
  expressed aromatase was observed, which was inconsistent with the observation that
  luteolin can inhibit aromatase activity by using partially purified aromatase prepared
  from human placenta.(35) This discrepancy is possible due to the different in vitro
  assay methods used. However, we found that luteolin exhibited the aromatase inhibitory
  effect only beginning at 12 h, indicating it may not directly inhibit the enzyme
  catalytic activity. Thus, whether luteolin can directly modulate the catalytic activity
  of aromatase needs to be further studied. Taken together with previous observations
  that some flavonoids such as apigenin and kaempferol can directly inhibit the catalytic
  activity of aromatase in placental microsomes or purified aromatase,(14) our results
  indicate that inhibition of aromatase by flavonoids may result from inhibition of
  aromatase expression, aromatase catalytic activity, and/or destabilization of aromatase
  protein.\n\nAromatase inhibitors derived from food sources or traditional medicines
  are preferred for more tissue specificity and less toxicity than those currently
  in clinical use.(14) We compared five widely consumed food-derived flavonoids—luteolin,
  isorhamnetin, quercetin, kaempferol, and myricetin—for their ability to inhibit
  aromatase activity. All except isorhamnetin could inhibit aromatase activity, albeit
  with differing potencies. Luteolin, one of the potent naturally occurring aromatase
  inhibitors, is present in many vegetables and fruits known to have multiple health
  benefits.(17) One of the prominent side effects of clinically used aromatase inhibitors
  is the increased risk for osteoporosis due to whole-body depletion of estrogen.
  However, luteolin has been found to have antiosteoporotic effects in vitro and in
  vivo through stimulation of osteoblast function and inhibition of osteoclast function.(36,
  37) Luteolin appears to be a safe natural flavonoid because long-term administration
  to rats did not reveal any obvious toxicity.(38) Thus, it will be important to examine
  whether luteolin can inhibit estrogen biosynthesis in vivo. A maximal plasma concentration
  of 3 μM luteolin was measured following oral dosing of rats with 15 mg/kg luteolin.(39)
  In the present study, we found that luteolin inhibited estrogen biosynthesis at
  a concentration as low as 1 μM. Thus, oral dosing with luteolin could achieve physiologically
  relevant plasma concentrations to inhibit aromatase enzyme activity and expression,
  making it one of the most promising flavonoids for therapeutic targeting of aromatase.
  Flavonoids with potent aromatase inhibitory activities, such as chrysin, naringenin,
  and apigenin, failed to inhibit uterine growth via aromatase in vivo.(40) The contradiction
  was possibly due to the negative feedback effect of estrogen depletion by increased
  secretion of follicle-stimulating hormone from the hypothalamus in rats with functional
  ovaries.(41) Thus, the ovariectomized rats with the aromatase-overexpressing MCF-7
  breast tumor should be used to evaluate the efficacy of these flavonoids, including
  luteolin, in the inhibition of aromatase-mediated breast tumorigenesis in vivo to
  obviate such negative feedback effect.\n\nOverexposure to environmental estrogenic
  compounds and the Western-style diet have contributed to the increased incidence
  of breast cancer.(2, 3) In contrast, consumption of large quantities of fruits and
  vegetables conveys protection against a variety of cancers, including breast cancer.(16)
  It has been found that red wine, grape seed, white button mushroom, and beer can
  inhibit aromatase activity and modulate estrogen biosynthesis.(42-46) Despite this,
  the role of fruits and vegetables in endogenous estrogen biosynthesis is still largely
  unknown. In this study, we compared two luteolin-containing vegetables—onion and
  bird chili—for their effects on estrogen biosynthesis. Interestingly, onion extracts
  significantly inhibited estrogen biosynthesis in both KGN cells and aromatase-expressing
  HEK293A cells, whereas bird chili extracts inhibited estrogen biosynthesis only
  in the HEK293A cells. The difference is possibly due to the cell permeability of
  the compounds, their composition, or concentration range of flavonoids contained
  in the food source. Different combinations of flavonoids may also change the solubility
  and/or accessibility of the compounds to intracellular aromatase or may act on aromatase
  through different mechanisms. As an example, some dietary flavonoids such as hesperetin
  can increase aromatase expression.(21) Thus, the composition and concentrations
  of flavonoids and the cell type being tested should be considered when fruits and
  vegetables are compared for their effects on estrogen biosynthesis.\n\nIn conclusion,
  we identified luteolin, distributed widely in consumed fruits and vegetables, as
  a potent inhibitor of estrogen biosynthesis in human ovarian granulosa-like KGN
  cells by decreasing aromatase expression and promoting its degradation. We also
  showed that other daily consumed flavonoids, including isorhamnetin, quercetin,
  kaempferol, and myricetin, inhibited estrogen biosynthesis with differing potencies.
  Two widely consumed vegetables, onion and bird chili, also differed in their ability
  to inhibit estrogen biosynthesis in KGN cells and in aromatase-expressing HEK293A
  cells. The present study suggests that luteolin may exert its estrogen biosynthesis
  inhibitory effect through suppression of aromatase expression and promotion of aromatase
  degradation, and it warrants further investigation as a potential agent for the
  treatment of breast cancer. Consumption of fruits and vegetables rich in flavonoids
  will be helpful for reducing endogenous estrogen levels in the prevention of estrogen-dependent
  disease, such as breast cancer.\n\n\nCytotoxic effects of luteolin, kaempferol,
  quercetin, myricetin, isorhamnetin, and plant extracts on KGN or HEK293A cells.
