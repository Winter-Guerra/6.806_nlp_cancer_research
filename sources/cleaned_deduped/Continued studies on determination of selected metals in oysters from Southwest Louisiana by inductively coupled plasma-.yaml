text: '


  This work provides results of a continued study of selected metal concentrations
  from oysters from Southwest Louisiana. Results were compared to previous studies
  in 2007 and 2009 and found to be comparable for three metals  lower for two metals  and
  slightly higher for one metal. Continued improvement  was found in this study compared
  to 2007 for Pd and Cd indicating that potential high concentrations from 2005 Hurricane
  Rita were significantly reduced.'
