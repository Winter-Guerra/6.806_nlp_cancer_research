  intakes of vitamin D and calcium and incidence of proliferative benign breast disease.md
text: "\n\nVitamin D and calcium have been shown to have protective effects against
  breast cancer development in animal studies. Vitamin D and calcium play important
  anticarcinogenic roles in animal studies. Exposures between menarche and first birth
  may be important in breast development and future breast cancer risk. However, the
  relations between adolescent vitamin D and calcium intake and the risk of proliferative
  benign breast disease, a marker of increased breast cancer risk, have not yet been
  evaluated. We examined these associations in the Nurses Health Study II. Among the
  29,480 women who completed an adolescent diet questionnaire in 1998, 682 proliferative
  BBD cases were identified and confirmed by centralized pathology review between
  1991 and 2001. Hazard ratios  and 95 % confidence intervals  were estimated by Cox
  proportional hazards regression and adjusted for potential confounders. A suggestive
  inverse association was observed between adolescent total vitamin D intake and proliferative
  BBD. Women in the highest quintile of vitamin D intake during adolescence had a
  21 % lower risk : 0.79, p-trend = 0.07) of proliferative BBD than women in the lowest
  quintile. Results were essentially the same when the analysis was restricted to
  prospective cases  diagnosed after return of the adolescent diet questionnaire and
  independent of adult vitamin D intake. Adolescent total milk intake was positively
  associated with proliferative BBD : 1.41, p-trend = 0.03), after additional adjustment
  for total vitamin D. Calcium intake during adolescence was not associated with proliferative
  BBD. Vitamin D intake during adolescence may be important in the earlier stage of
  breast carcinogenesis. These findings, if corroborated, may suggest new pathways
  and strategies for breast cancer prevention.\n\nVitamin D and calcium play important
  anticarcinogenic roles in cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis in
  animal studies. A meta-analysis of epidemiological studies reported significant
  inverse associations between intakes of vitamin D and calcium and breast cancer
  among premenopausal, but not postmenopausal women. Exposures during childhood and
  adolescence can be more important than adult exposures in breast cancer development
  \ due to rapid proliferation of cells and lack of terminal differentiation. Whereas
  adolescent vitamin D intake was not associated with breast cancer risk in the Nurses
  Health Study   or Nurses Health Study II, inverse associations were observed in
  a casecontrol study.\n\nBenign breast disease  includes various histologic subtypes,
  among which proliferative BBD is a marker of subsequent breast cancer risk. Studies
  of diet and BBD could provide insights into the role of diet in the earlier stage
  of breast carcinogenesis. A non-significant inverse association was found between
  adult calcium and BBD. Calcium plus vitamin D supplementation was not associated
  with breast cancer  or BBD in the Womens Health Initiative.\n\nTo our knowledge,
  the associations between adolescent intakes of vitamin D and calcium and proliferative
  BBD have not been examined in previous studies. We evaluated these associations
  and dairy consumption in relation to proliferative BBD in the NHSII, because dairy
  products are the main sources of dietary calcium and vitamin D. We further conducted
  analysis prospectively by restricting to cases diagnosed after the return of the
  adolescent diet questionnaire.\n\nThe NHSII cohort was established in 1989 when
  116,671 U.S. female registered nurses aged 2542 years returned a self-administered
  questionnaire on health-related exposures and diseases. Biennial follow-up has been
  conducted since 1989. The current study included 45,948 women who completed a supplemental
  food-frequency questionnaire  in 1998 with plausible energy intake values.\n\nThe
  semi-quantitative 124-item HS-FFQ asked about the nurses usual dietary intake during
  adolescence, further defined as ages 1318 years. The development of the HS-FFQ has
  been described in detail in another report. Briefly, it was modified from the well-validated
  adult diet FFQ of the NHS and NHSII and specifically designed to include commonly
  consumed food items  when this cohort of women would have been in high school, i.e.,
  from 1960 to 1982. There were eight categories including main dishes, bread/cereal/grains,
  fruits, vegetables, condiments, snack foods/desserts, dairy products, and beverages.
  Participants were asked how often, on average, they had consumed a specified portion
  size of each item during adolescence.\n\nHistorical trends in the food supply enrichment
  with certain key vitamins, for instance, the vitamin D fortification of milk were
  incorporated in nutrient intake derivation. We used each participants year of birth
  and food composition data from the relevant time period, whenever available, to
  assign different nutrient profiles for specific foods.\n\nIn a reproducibility study
  among randomly selected 333 women who completed the HS-FFQ, the intraclass correlation
  coefficient  between two HS-FFQs administered in 1998 and 2002 was 0.71 for total
  vitamin D, 0.68 for vitamin D without supplements, and 0.73 for calcium, and the
  Spearman correlation for dairy foods was 0.64. The recalled adolescent diet was
  weakly correlated with the 1995 diet, the last adult dietary assessment before the
  1998 HS-FFQ. Correlations remained low using diet reported in 1999.\n\nA validation
  study using data collected during adolescence from the participants who returned
  the HS-FFQ in 1998 is not possible because these women were 3451 years at the time
  of HS-FFQ completion. However, 272 nurses mothers reported their daughters adolescent
  diet and adequate validity was found. The Pearson correlation was 0.48 for total
  vitamin D, 0.46 for vitamin D without supplements, and 0.47 for calcium. These findings
  indicate that the HS-FFQ provides a reasonable record of adolescent dietary intake.\n\nDetails
  about BBD case identification, confirmation, and exclusion criteria have been published
  previously. Briefly, women who reported a biopsy-confirmed BBD diagnosis between
  the 1993 through 2001 questionnaires were contacted for permission to obtain pathology
  specimens. Three pathologists  blinded to participants adolescent diet information
  independently classified benign breast lesions as nonproliferative, proliferative
  without atypia, and atypical hyperplasia  following Dupont and Pages criteria. The
  same three pathologists reviewed all benign biopsy slides throughout the study,
  and any biopsy specimens that showed atypia or questionable atypia were jointly
  reviewed by two pathologists. Pathology-confirmed proliferative BBD with or without
  atypia was the outcome of interest because this histological subtype is associated
  with increased breast cancer risk. The total number of proliferative BBD cases included
  was 682, among which 142 were prospective cases whose biopsy date was after their
  return of the HS-FFQ. Atypical hyperplasia  was not examined as a separate outcome
  due to the small numbers of cases.\n\nWe conducted two main analyses: combined analysis
  including all proliferative BBD cases diagnosed before and after the return of the
  HS-FFQ and prospective analysis to assess the possibility of recall bias by restricting
  to cases diagnosed after completion of the HS-FFQ. The combined analysis is the
  primary analysis because these results are consistent with those of the prospective
  analysis and have increased study power. Details of the two analyses have been published
  previously. The combined analysis included 29,480 participants with 259,828 person
  years of follow-up and the prospective analysis had 23,946 women. The study was
  approved by human research committees at the Harvard School of Public Health and
  Brigham and Womens Hospital, Boston, MA.\n\nThe main exposures were adolescent total
  vitamin D  and calcium. Nutrients were energy-adjusted using the residuals from
  the linear regression of nutrient intake on total caloric intake. We also evaluated
  sources of vitamin D and calcium, including vitamin D without supplements, vitamin
  D supplements, dairy and non-dairy vitamin D, dairy and non-dairy calcium, and dairy
  protein. Raw nutrient values were derived for vitamin D supplements by subtracting
  vitamin D without supplements from total vitamin D and total energy included in
  the model for adjustment, due to very little correlation between vitamin D supplementation
  and total energy. Non-dairy vitamin D  was derived by subtracting dairy vitamin
  D  from vitamin D without supplements  and energy-adjusted nutrient residuals calculated.
  Because milk was the major contributing food to vitamin D  and calcium  and dark
  fish the major contributing food to non-dairy vitamin D, we further examined the
  associations between consumption of these foods and proliferative BBD. Quintiles
  of energy-adjusted nutrient residuals and categories of food servings were determined
  by the distributions among all eligible women.\n\nCox proportional hazards regression
  was used to calculate hazard ratios  and 95 % confidence intervals  with the lowest
  quintile or category as the reference group and follow-up time as the time variable.
  The multivariate Cox models were adjusted for age, total energy, age at menarche,
  menopausal status, childhood body size, family history of breast cancer, alcohol
  intake between ages 18 and 22, adolescent multivitamin use, recency and duration
  of oral contraceptive  use, and parity and age at first birth. Models with total
  vitamin D, vitamin D supplements, and calcium as exposures were not adjusted for
  multivitamin use due to the consideration of colinearity. Adolescent multivitamin
  use was asked and energy intake calculated from the HS-FFQ. Age at menarche, alcohol
  intake between ages 18 and 22, and childhood body size were assessed in 1989. The
  body size measurement asked women to choose one of nine pictorial diagrams  that
  best depicted their body outline at ages 5 and 10, where level 1 represents the
  most lean and level 9 represents the most overweight. The childhood body size was
  obtained by averaging the figures at ages 5 and 10. Age, menopausal status, OC use,
  and parity and age at first birth were updated every 2 years. Family history of
  breast cancer was initially assessed in 1989 and updated in 1997. To test for trend,
  the Wald statistic was calculated by including the median value of each quintile
  or category as a continuous variable. All statistical tests were two sided.\n\nWomen
  with high intake of total vitamin D and calcium were more likely to be older at
  first birth, have smaller childhood body size, and have used multivitamins during
  adolescence, but less likely to have ever used OC than women with lower intake.
  The Spearman correlation coefficient was 0.69 for vitamin D and calcium, 0.95 for
  dairy vitamin D and dairy calcium, and 0.25 for non-dairy vitamin D and non-dairy
  calcium.\n\nAge and age-standardized percentages and means for characteristics of
  participants according to total vitamin D and calcium intake during adolescence
  among 29,480 women in the Nurses Health Study IIa  \n\naExcept for the data on mean
  age, all data shown are standardized to the age distribution of the cohort in 1991\n\nA
  suggestive inverse association was observed between adolescent total vitamin D intake
  and proliferative BBD. Women in the highest quintile had a 21 % lower risk of proliferative
  BBD : 0.79, p-trend = 0.07) than women in the lowest quintile. Adjustment for adult
  vitamin D intake did not change the estimates : 0.78, p-trend = 0.06). The vitamin
  D-BBD association became statistically significant after additional adjustment for
  calcium intake. The inverse association remained, though not significant, in the
  prospective analysis : 0.81, p-trend = 0.46). Higher intake of vitamin D without
  supplements and from supplements was also associated with lower proliferative BBD
  risk, although no significant trend was observed. No association was observed for
  dairy vitamin D. For non-dairy vitamin D, reduction of proliferative BBD risk was
  observed in the highest intake level in the combined : 0.82, p-trend = 0.06) and
  prospective analysis : 0.52, p-trend = 0.05). Intake of dark fish was marginally
  significant in the combined analysis : 0.74  and became significant in the prospective
  analysis : 0.45, p-trend = 0.04).\n\nIntakes of vitamin D and sources of vitamin

  between ages 13 and 18 years, recency and duration of OC use, and parity and age
  at first birth. The age-adjusted results are essentially the same, and only multivariate
  adjusted results are presented. Models with total vitamin D and vitamin D supplements

  adjusted results are presented\n\ndIncludes milk, yogurt, instant breakfast drink,
  yogurt, cottage or ricotta cheese, cream cheese, other cheese, sherbet, ice cream,
  and milkshake or frappe. Butter is not included\n\nTo our knowledge, this is the
  first study to comprehensively examine the associations between adolescent intakes
  of various sources of vitamin D and calcium and the risk of proliferative BBD. We
  observed a suggestive inverse association between adolescent intake of total vitamin
  D and proliferative BBD. Total milk intake was associated with an increased risk
  of proliferative BBD, after additional adjustment for total vitamin D. The highest
  intake level of non-dairy vitamin D was associated with a reduced risk, whereas
  no association was found between dairy vitamin D and proliferative BBD.\n\nOur study
  may have limited power to detect a significant association for vitamin D from supplements,
  because only 16 % of women used multivitamin during adolescence. Dark fish, the
  major source of adolescent non-dairy vitamin D in our study, was marginally associated
  with proliferative BBD. One possible explanation could be that the inverse association
  attributed to vitamin D is due to dark fish. Alternatively, this difference could
  be an artifact of differential recall for different foods and the recall of fish
  intake may be better than that of other foods and hence less measurement error.
  Nonetheless, recall of milk was highly reproducible and in general dairy foods had
  higher correlations between the first and second administration than main dishes.
  Finally, it may be not differences in the vitamin D in dairy and non-dairy products
  that affect BBD risk, but that other nutrients in milk or dairy products might be
  linked to increased risk and mask the effect of vitamin D in these products. More
  research on adolescent diet and breast disease may provide further insights into
  these issues. The reduction in risk for non-dairy vitamin D was only found in the
  5th quintile. Future studies need to ascertain the optimal vitamin D intake from
  different sources during adolescence.\n\nIt is hypothesized that Vitamin D exerts
  protective effects on breast carcinogenesis mainly through its metabolites. Animal
  studies have shown that 1,252D, the biologically active vitamin D metabolite, can
  inhibit cellular proliferation and angiogenesis and induce differentiation and apoptosis.
  Higher levels of circulating 25D, the precursor of 1,252D and best indicator of
  endogenous vitamin D status, have been related to lower breast cancer risk. A statistically
  significant inverse association between vitamin D intake and breast cancer has been
  observed among premenopausal but not postmenopausal women. A possible explanation
  to the difference by menopausal status could be due to biologic interactions between
  vitamin D metabolites, the vitamin D receptor, and the higher circulating estrogen
  and insulin-like growth factor-I   among premenopausal than postmenopausal women.
  Vitamin D could suppress 17-estradiol and IGF-I-stimulated cellular growth, inhibit
  the antiapoptotic effect of IGF-I, and decrease expression levels of receptors of
  estrogen and IGF-I. Meanwhile, the expression of VDR can be upregulated by estrogen
  and IGF-I in breast cancer cells. Because a majority of participants  in our study
  were premenopausal at the time of their BBD, it is possible that vitamin D may interact
  with other hormones to reduce proliferative BBD risk. Adolescent vitamin D intake
  was, however, not associated with breast cancer risk in the NHS or NHSII cohorts.
  One possible explanation is that vitamin D may be more important in the earlier
  breast carcinogenic process. Conversely, inverse associations were observed between
  adolescent vitamin D exposures and breast cancer in a casecontrol study. Future
  studies, particularly studies focusing on the late stage from BBD to breast cancer
  development, will further illuminate the role of vitamin D in breast carcinogenesis.\n\nNo
  association has been observed between adolescent  or adult dairy intake and BBD.
  Results on the associations between adolescent  or adult dairy intake and breast
  cancer  have been inconsistent. Few studies, however, have taken vitamin D or calcium
  into account when examining dairy consumption and breast disease risk. Previous
  studies have linked higher milk intake with more rapid child growth. Childhood and
  adolescent vitamin D and dairy intake may influence hormone levels and/or growth
  during this critical period and set endocrine profiles in adulthood, thus affecting
  subsequent breast disease and/or cancer risk. Considering the varying practices
  of vitamin D fortification in different countries and the high correlation between
  various nutrients in dairy products, it will be important to understand the relation
  between milk and dairy consumption, circulating hormone levels, and breast disease
  risk across the life course.\n\nAdolescent calcium intake was not associated with
  proliferative BBD in our study. Adjustment for calcium intake, however, strengthened
  the vitamin D-BBD association. Given the much stronger correlation between dairy
  vitamin D and dairy calcium  than that between vitamin D and calcium from non-dairy
  sources, one possible explanation could be that the adjustment for calcium is basically
  adjusting for dairy intake, leaving mostly the non-dairy vitamin D. Alternatively,
  these results may suggest that the association observed for vitamin D is independent
  of calcium.\n\nThis is the first study to comprehensively assess the associations
  between adolescent intakes of various sources of vitamin D and calcium and the subsequent
  BBD. The centralized pathology review and confirmation minimized misclassification
  of BBD cases. We included a large number of cases and had sufficient power to detect
  significant associations. The consistent results obtained from the combined and
  prospective analyses, suggesting that any possible recall bias due to BBD diagnosis
  or changes in diet after diagnosis should be minimal. The essentially equivalent
  results of the age- and multivariate-adjusted analyses suggest that uncontrolled
  confounding is unlikely to entirely account for the observed associations.\n\nOne
  limitation of this study is the measurement of adolescent diet. In our study, women
  recalled their adolescent dietary intake 1638 years later. Although comparison with
  maternal reports provides some reassurance, the validity of recall after so many
  years has not been established. However, the observed association was independent
  of current intake. Another limitation for vitamin D is the assessment of diet only.
  Since a high percentage of vitamin D exposure comes from ultraviolet B radiation
  via sunlight to skin, the measurement of vitamin D dietary intake is only a weak
  indicator of vitamin D status. Nonetheless, information on adolescent sunlight exposure
  or geographical residential region as a proxy of sunlight exposure was not available
  in NHSII. In the absence of dietary data actually collected during adolescence and
  given that collecting blood samples and measuring adolescent circulating 25D would
  not be feasible in this sort of cohort study, our results provide the best estimate
  currently available of relationships between adolescent vitamin D intake and proliferative
  BBD.\n\nIn summary, we observed suggestive inverse associations between adolescent
  intake of total vitamin D and non-dairy vitamin D and proliferative BBD. Our results
  support the hypothesis that early life exposures are important in breast carcinogenesis.
  As diet is a modifiable risk factor, these findings, if substantiated, may open
  new pathways and strategies for breast cancer prevention.\n\nThis work was supported
