  This study describes the occurrence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in smoked
  tea and tea infusions, via the monitoring of benzo(a)anthracene, chrysene, benzo(b)fluoranthene
  and benzo(a)pyrene that have been chosen as indicators for the occurrence of PAHs
  in food by the European Food Safety Agency. The concentrations ranged from 1.2 Î¼g/kg
  for benzo(b)fluoranthene to 125.0 Î¼g/kg for benzo(a)anthracene in smoked tea leaves,
  and from 0.6 Î¼g/L for benzo(a)anthracene to 1.2 Î¼g/L for benzo(b)fluoranthene
  in smoked tea infusions. Benzo(a)pyrene was never detected in infusions. The concentrations
  in non-smoked tea leaves ranged from 0.6 Î¼g/kg for benzo(a)anthracene to 10.8 Î¼g/kg
  for benzo(b)fluoranthene. It was shown that the concentrations of benzo(a)anthracene
  and chrysene were higher in smoked tea than in non-smoked tea while no difference
  was observed for benzo(b)fluoranthene and benzo(a)pyrene. The concentrations of
  PAHs in tea infusions are low compared to other foodstuffs, but the migration rates
  from leaves into water are high.'
