  To clarify the effects of natural dietary components on the metabolic consequences
  of obesity, we examined the effects of yerba mate extract Ilex paraguariensis on
  both central and peripheral inflammatory effects of diet-induced obesity and correlated
  the hypothalamic tumor necrosis factor-Î± level with adipose depot weight. Wistar
  rats were divided into four groups: a control group fed with chow diet, a second
  group fed with chow diet plus yerba mate extract, a third group fed with a high-fat
  diet rich in saturated fatty acids and a fourth group fed with HFD plus yerba mate
  extract. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, Western blotting, colorimetric method
  and treatment by gavage were utilized as materials and methods. The HFD groups showed
  a significant increase in food intake, body weight, adipose tissue and leptin level
  in comparison to CTL and CTL+E. HFD leads to increase of both central and peripheral
  inflammatory effects, and deregulation of insulin pathway. In addition, yerba mate
  extract intake blunted the proinflammatory effects of diet-induced obesity in rats
  by reducing the phosphorylation of hypothalamic IKK and NFÎºBp65 expression and
  increasing the protein levels of IÎºBÎ±, the expression of adiponectin receptor-1
  and consequently the amount of IRS-2. Moreover, the increase in interleukin-6 levels
  in the liver and muscle and of the IL-10/TNF-Î± ratio in groups that received yerba
  mate extract showed the anti-inflammatory effects of this natural substance. Taken
  together, our data suggest that the use of yerba mate extract may be useful for
  reducing low-grade obesity-associated inflammation.'
