  Previous investigations found high dairy intakes in girls associated with rapid
  height growth and excess weight gain, which had opposite relationships with benign
  breast disease in young women. We use data from the longitudinal Growing Up Today
  Study to investigate whether dairy intakes, in older children/adolescents, are associated
  with BBD risk in young women. GUTS includes 9,039 females, ages 9–15 years in 1996,
  who completed questionnaires annually through 2001, then in 2003, 2005, 2007, and
  2010. Dietary food frequencies obtained milk, yogurt, and cheese intakes. On 2005–2010
  surveys, 7,011 females reported whether a health care provider ever diagnosed them
  with BBD and if confirmed by breast biopsy. Logistic regression models estimated
  associations between prevalent biopsy-confirmed BBD and dairy intakes, adjusted
  for age and energy. Multivariable-adjusted models additionally included menarche
  age, childhood adiposity, adolescent alcohol consumption, and pregnancy. Further
  analyses stratified by family history. Age-energy–adjusted models of dairy intakes
  at 14 yr found no significant associations with BBD risk [milk: OR, 0.90/(serving/d);
  95% confidence interval, 0.76–1.05; dairy protein: OR, 0.98/(10 g/d); 95% CI, 0.82–1.17).
  Separate analyses of dairy intakes at 10 yr, intakes before the growth spurt, during
  the growth spurt, before menses-onset, and after menses-onset provided no significant
  associations with BBD. Multivariable adjustment, and family history stratification,
  did not alter the above findings. We conclude that dairy intakes by older girls
  have no strong relation with BBD risk in young women. Because of small number of
  cases, it is important to continue follow-up and re-examine later. Cancer Epidemiol
