  Objective To investigate the association between dietary protein sources in early
  adulthood and risk of breast cancer.




  Participants 88 803 premenopausal women from the Nurses’ Health Study II who completed
  a questionnaire on diet in 1991.


  Main outcome measure Incident cases of invasive breast carcinoma, identified through
  self report and confirmed by pathology report.


  Results We documented 2830 cases of breast cancer during 20 years of follow-up.
  Higher intake of total red meat was associated with an increased risk of breast
  cancer overall. However, higher intakes of poultry, fish, eggs, legumes, and nuts
  were not related to breast cancer overall. When the association was evaluated by
  menopausal status, higher intake of poultry was associated with a lower risk of
  breast cancer in postmenopausal women but not in premenopausal women. In estimating
  the effects of exchanging different protein sources, substituting one serving/day
  of legumes for one serving/day of red meat was associated with a 15% lower risk
  of breast cancer among all women and a 19% lower risk among premenopausal women.
  Also, substituting one serving/day of poultry for one serving/day of red meat was
  associated with a 17% lower risk of breast cancer overall and a 24% lower risk of
  postmenopausal breast cancer. Furthermore, substituting one serving/day of combined
  legumes, nuts, poultry, and fish for one serving/day of red meat was associated
  with a 14% lower risk of breast cancer overall and premenopausal breast cancer.


  Conclusion Higher red meat intake in early adulthood may be a risk factor for breast
  cancer, and replacing red meat with a combination of legumes, poultry, nuts and
  fish may reduce the risk of breast cancer.




  The potential influence of dietary protein on risk of breast cancer has created
  considerable scientific attention.1 High protein intake may affect the risk of breast
  cancer by increasing the insulin-like growth factor 1 that plays important roles
  in tissue growth and tumor progression.1 2 However, foods that are major sources
  of protein differ widely in their nutrient profiles and may have different effects
  on breast cancer risk. The overall evidence from prospective cohort studies has
  suggested no significant association between red meat intake and breast cancer.
  A pooled analysis of eight cohort studies found a null association between intake
  of red meat and risk of breast cancer.3 Also, a recent review and meta-analysis
  of prospective cohort studies4 and a recent prospective study5 did not show effects
  of red meat intake on breast cancer risk. However, most of the evidence has come
  from studies that evaluated diet during midlife and later. In the Nurses’ Health
  Study II cohort, red meat intake during early adulthood was associated with an increased
  risk of breast cancer in premenopausal women.6 Moreover, in most prospective studies,
  little relation has been seen between intakes of other protein rich foods such as
  fish, poultry, eggs, legumes, or nuts and risk of breast cancer, but data from early
  adult life are also limited.7 8 9 10 11


  The exposures between menarche and first pregnancy may be more important in the
  development of breast cancer. Epidemiologic studies of women who survived the atomic
  bombing in Hiroshima and Nagasaki and radiation treatment for Hodgkin’s lymphoma
  have shown that exposure to radiation in childhood and early adulthood was associated
  with subsequent risk of cancer, but radiation was less strongly related to risk
  of breast cancer among women older than 30 years at the time of exposure.12 13 14


  Although breast tumors vary by estrogen and progesterone receptor status, most previous
  studies have evaluated the relation between dietary sources of protein and breast
  cancer, with limited information on how the cancers differed by hormone receptor
  status.5 6 In an early analysis from the Nurses’ Health Study II with 12 years of
  follow-up,6 we reported a positive association between red meat intake and breast
  cancer in premenopausal women, especially tumors with positive hormone receptors.
  However, it was not clear whether the positive findings were due to early age at
  dietary assessment or the relatively young age of women at diagnosis of breast cancer.
  In this updated analysis with longer follow-up and approximately three times the
  number of cases of breast cancer, we investigated the association of total intakes
  of unprocessed and processed red meat before menopause with risk of breast cancer
  overall and separately among premenopausal and postmenopausal women. In addition
  we examined the associations between breast cancer and other protein rich foods,
  including poultry, fish, eggs, legumes, and nuts. Furthermore, we evaluated whether
  the association between red meat and breast cancer differs by hormone receptor status.






  The Nurses’ Health Study II began in 1989 and is a prospective cohort study of 116
  430 female registered nurses who were 24 to 43 years of age. In 1991, participants
  were asked to complete a food frequency questionnaire about usual dietary intake
  in the past year. A total of 97 813 women answered the questionnaire. We excluded
  those who had an implausible daily energy intake or left more than 70 food items
  blank on the food frequency questionnaire. Of the remaining 95 452, we excluded
  women who were postmenopausal in 1991. Participants were also excluded if they had
  a diagnosis of any cancer except non-melanoma skin cancer, diabetes, coronary heart
  disease, or stroke before returning the 1991 questionnaire, or had missing data
  on age or red meat intake. We included 88 803 women in the analysis. The cumulative
  response rate among living participants was 95%.




  Participants completed a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire with approximately
  130 items in 1991, 1995, 1999, 2003, and 2007 about usual dietary intake and alcohol
  consumption during the past year. Total red meat items listed on the food frequency
  questionnaire included unprocessed red meat and processed red meat; poultry included
  chicken and turkey; fish included tuna, dark meat fish, and other fish; legumes
  included tofu or soybeans, string beans, beans, or lentils, and peas or lima beans;
  and nuts included peanut, peanut butter, and other nuts. Responses were given for
  commonly used portion sizes and nine categories of intake frequency ranging from
  “never or less than once per month” to “six or more per day.”


  Food intake during adolescence was measured in 1998 using a 124 item food frequency
  questionnaire, which was specifically designed to contain foods that were usually
  consumed during the periods from 1960 to 1980 when these women would have been in
  high school. Food items included in the food frequency questionnaire for adolescents
  and response categories were similar to those in the food frequency questionnaire
  for adults.


  We calculated nutrient intakes by multiplying the frequency of consumption of each
  item by the nutrient content of the specified portions and then summing across all
  items. Nutrient values in foods were obtained from the US Department of Agriculture,
  food manufacturers, independent academic sources, and our own fatty acid analyses
  of commonly used margarines, cooking oils, and baked foods.15 16 17 Every four years,
  the food composition database was updated to account for changes in the food supply.
  We calculated the percentage of energy from total fat by dividing energy intake
  from total fat by total energy intake. Using the residuals from the regression of
  nutrient intake on total energy intake, we adjusted total iron and heme iron for
  energy.18 19 We did not adjust food intakes for total energy intake, as the correlation
  between individual foods and total energy intake was low.


  The reproducibility and validity of food frequency questionnaires for measuring
  individual red meat items have been evaluated in 173 women from the Nurses’ Health
  Study. The correlation coefficients for intake of individual red meat items comparing
  diet records with the food frequency questionnaire were mostly higher than 0.5 after
  correction for attenuation because of within person variation in diet records.20




  We identified new cases of breast cancers from biennial questionnaires. Then we
  got permission from women with breast cancer or next of kin for those who had died
  to review hospital records and pathology reports. Deaths in this cohort were reported
  through family members and the postal service in response to the follow-up questionnaires
  or identified through annual review of the national death index. Medical records
  were obtained for 88% of cases in the Nurses’ Health Study II included in this analysis.
  More than 98% of self reported breast cancers were confirmed through review of pathology
  reports. Therefore we included self reported cases with missing pathology reports
  in the analysis. We excluded cases of carcinoma in situ from the analyses. To determine
  the estrogen and progesterone receptor status of the breast cancer we abstracted
  information from pathology reports.




  From the biennial Nurses’ Health Study II questionnaires we collected information
  on risk factors for breast cancer, including age, height, weight, family history
  of breast cancer, history of benign breast disease, smoking, race, age at menarche,
  parity, age at first birth, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, age at
  menopause, and oral contraceptive use. All variables except race, height, and age
  at menarche were updated to the most recent information before date of diagnosis,
  whenever available. We considered women to be premenopausal if they still had menstrual
  periods or had hysterectomy with at least one ovary remaining and were younger than
  46 years for smokers or younger than 48 years for non-smokers. Women were considered
  as postmenopausal if they reported permanent cessation of menstrual periods or had
  undergone bilateral oophorectomy. We defined women of unknown menopausal status
  or who had hysterectomy without bilateral oophorectomy as postmenopausal if they
  were 54 years or older for smokers or 56 years or older for non-smokers.21




  We calculated person years from the return date of the 1991 questionnaire until
  the date of breast cancer diagnosis, death, or end of follow-up, whichever came
  first. We used the dietary intake in 1991 in the primary analysis as this represents
  the dietary intake in early adulthood. Women were divided into five categories according
  to food group or nutrient intake. We used Cox proportional hazards models, stratified
  by age in months and questionnaire year, to estimate relative risk and 95% confidence
  intervals. Multivariable models adjusted for race, family history of breast cancer
  in mother or sisters, history of benign breast disease, smoking, height, body mass
  index, age at menarche, parity, age at first birth, oral contraceptive use, and
  alcohol and energy intakes, and, for postmenopausal women, age at menopause and
  hormone use. For all women, we additionally adjusted for menopausal status. We replaced
  missing covariate data, which comprised 5.5% of total person years for oral contraceptive
  use and less than 5% of total person years for body mass index, smoking, height,
  age at menarche, age at menopause, parity, and age at first birth, with the carried
  forward method for continuous variables and missing indicator method for categorical
  variables.


  To best represent long term effects of food intake on breast carcinogenesis and
  to minimize measurement error caused by within person variation, we calculated premenopausal
  cumulative averaged intakes of food groups using the 1991, 1995, 1999, 2003, and
  2007 dietary data for a sensitivity analysis. To evaluate the effects of diet during
  the premenopausal period on risk of breast cancer, we stopped updating the dietary
  data when the participants reported change in menopausal status. We used the median
  value of each variable in each fifth as a continuous variable for tests for trend.
  We estimated the effect of substituting one serving/day of poultry, fish, legumes,
  eggs, or nuts for one serving/day of total red meat by including simultaneously
  these food items as well as low fat dairy products and high fat dairy products as
  continuous variables in the multivariable model. The relative risk and the 95% confidence
  intervals for the substitution effect were derived from the difference between the
  regression coefficients, variances, and covariance.22 We examined effect modification
  for the association between red meat and breast cancer risk by other measures of
  breast cancer risk factors. A cross product interaction term between each factor
  and intake of red meat expressed as a continuous variable was included in the multivariable
  model. We used a likelihood ratio test with one degree of freedom to derive P values
  for tests for interactions. We also tested the differential association between
  total red meat intake and breast cancer risk by estrogen and progesterone receptor
  status using Cox proportional cause specific hazards regression model with a duplication
  method for competing risk data. This method permits the estimation of separate associations
  of red meat with each of positive estrogen and progesterone receptors and negative
  estrogen and progesterone receptors, and has been used to assess whether red meat
  intake has statistically different regression coefficients for different tumor subtype.
  We used SAS version 9.3 for all analyses. All P values are two sided.




  During 1 725 419 person years of follow-up of 88 803 premenopausal women, 2830 cases
  of invasive breast carcinoma were documented between 1991 and 2011. The average
  age of the participants in 1991 was 36.4 years and the average age of breast cancer
  diagnosis was 45 years in premenopausal women and 55 years in postmenopausal women.
  Table 1⇓ shows the age adjusted distribution of breast cancer risk factors according
  to fifths of total red meat intake. Compared with women who consumed a lower amount
  of red meat, women with a higher intake were more likely to have a larger body mass
  index, to have higher energy intake, to smoke, and to have three or more children
  as well as less likely to use oral contraceptives and to have a history of benign
  breast disease.

  to fifths of total red meat intake in 1991 among women enrolled in the Nurses’ Health
  Study II



  Among all women, higher total red meat intake in 1991 was associated with an increased
  risk of breast cancer in multivariable analysis. Similar point estimates were observed
  among premenopausal and postmenopausal women, separately, though they did not reach
  statistical significance. Among all women, the positive association between total
  red meat was still significant after additional adjustment for total fat intake,
  fruits and vegetables intake, or heme iron. We also controlled for the frequency
  of having fried foods at home and away from home, but the results were not appreciably
  altered. When total red meat intake was modeled as a continuous variable, each additional
  serving/day increase in total red meat was associated with a 13% increase in risk
  of breast cancer among all women, 12% increase among premenopausal women, and 8%
  increase among postmenopausal women. Additional adjustment for red meat intake during
  adolescence did not appreciably attenuate the relative risk. Among women with dietary
  data for both adulthood and adolescence, the relative risk for one serving/day of
  total red meat intake during adulthood was 1.20 for breast cancer overall and 1.24
  for premenopausal breast cancer. After additional adjustment for red meat intake
  during adolescence, the relative risk was 1.18 for breast cancer overall and 1.20
  for premenopausal breast cancer. In a sensitivity analysis using the cumulative
  average of premenopausal intake, similar results have been found.

  protein in 1991 among women in the Nurses’ Health Study II. Values are relative
  risks unless stated otherwise



  Poultry intake in 1991 was associated with a lower risk of postmenopausal breast
  cancer, and the estimate was unchanged with adjustment for fat or fruits and vegetables
  intakes. Also, cumulative average of premenopausal intake of poultry was associated
  with a lower risk of postmenopausal breast cancer: each additional serving/day of
  poultry was associated with a 25% lower risk of postmenopausal breast cancer. Neither
  baseline intakes of poultry, nor the cumulative average of premenopausal poultry
  intakes, were associated with premenopausal risk of breast cancer. Intakes of legumes,
  fish, eggs, and nuts were not associated with either premenopausal or postmenopausal
  breast cancer. In age adjusted and multivariable adjusted models, none of the tests
  for trend were significant across fifths of total iron and heme iron intakes in
  early adulthood and breast cancer incidence in either premenopausal or postmenopausal
  women.

  stated otherwise



  Based on diet in 1991, substituting one serving/day of legumes for one serving/day
  of total red meat was associated with a lower risk of breast cancer among all women
  and among premenopausal women. Replacement of one serving/day of total red meat
  with one serving/day of poultry was associated with a lower risk of breast cancer
  in all women and postmenopausal women. Furthermore, substituting one serving/day
  of combined legumes, nuts, poultry, and fish for one serving/day of red meat was
  associated with a 14% lower risk of breast cancer overall and a 14% lower risk of
  premenopausal breast cancer.

  with substitution of dietary sources of protein for total red meat among women in
  Nurses’ Health Study II. Multivariable model was adjusted for variables in footnote
  of table 2 as well as total red meat, legumes, nuts, poultry, fish, eggs, low fat
  dairy, and high fat dairy. This model was adjusted for variables in footnote of
  table 2 as well as total red meat, sum of legumes, nuts, poultry, and fish intake,
  eggs, low fat dairy, and high fat dairy


  We had information on estrogen receptor status for 81% of breast cancers and progesterone
  receptor status for 80% of breast cancers. Supplementary table S2 presents the associations
  between total red meat intake and breast cancer risk according to hormone receptor
  status; data are presented for both tumors with positive estrogen and progesterone
  receptors and tumors with negative estrogen and progesterone receptors. We did not
  observe significant heterogeneity between total red meat intake and tumor status
  in either premenopausal or postmenopausal breast cancer.


  We also examined whether the association between intake of red meat and breast cancer
  risk differed by levels of risk factors for breast cancer, including family history
  of breast cancer, body mass index, oral contraceptive use, smoking, history of benign
  breast disease, alcohol intake, postmenopausal hormone use, age at first birth,
  and parity. The association between red meat intake and breast cancer risk was modified
  by oral contraceptives. For each serving/day of total red meat, the risk of breast
  cancer was 54% higher among women who currently used oral contraceptives and 11%
  higher in women who were former users, with no association in non-users; the interaction
  was also significant among premenopausal women.




  We found that higher consumption of red meat in women during early adulthood was
  associated with a higher risk of breast cancer. Adjusting for animal fat, fruits
  and vegetables, and heme iron did not appreciably change the association between
  red meat intake and breast cancer risk. Moreover, poultry intake was associated
  with a lower risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal women. Although intakes of
  legumes, fish, eggs, and nuts were not significantly associated with breast cancer
  in either premenopausal or postmenopausal women, substituting legumes or poultry
  or the combination of poultry, fish, legumes, and nuts for red meat was associated
  with a lower risk of breast cancer. In addition, higher intakes of total iron or
  heme iron were not associated with risk of breast cancer.




  The evidence from prospective studies concerning a role of red meat intake during
  adulthood in risk of breast cancer is not consistent.3 5 7 8 A recent review and
  meta-analysis of prospective studies on consumption of unprocessed and processed
  red meat and breast cancer incidence found that the intake of the red meat was not
  independently associated with increasing breast cancer risk.4 However, most of the
  results have been derived from diet during midlife and later, and red meat intake
  during early adulthood may be more related to an increased risk of breast cancer.
  Carcinogenic byproducts such as heterocyclic amines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons,
  created during high temperature cooking of meat; animal fat and heme iron from red
  meat; and hormone residues of the exogenous hormones for growth stimulation in beef
  cattle are some of the mechanisms that may explain the positive association between
  high intake of red meat and risk of breast cancer.23 24 25 26 27 28 We had only
  limited information on cooking methods of red meat. Controlling for the frequency
  of fried foods at home and away from home in this analysis did not alter the results.
  Furthermore, our findings persisted after adjustment for heme iron or total fat,
  thus reducing the possibility that they were due to higher intake of heme iron and
  fat.


  We found that the risk of breast cancer was lower in women who replaced red meat
  with legumes in early adulthood. Legumes contain several components such as fiber
  and phytoestrogen, which have been negatively associated with breast cancer incidence.29
  30 The anticarcinogenic effects of beans have been shown in animal models.31 An
  intervention study reported that substituting a diet high in vegetable fat and protein
  for a diet high in animal fat and protein could reduce the circulating estrogen
  levels by more than 40%.32 Reduction in insulin, insulin-like growth factor, and
  inflammatory biomarkers, or alterations in lipid metabolism are mechanisms that
  could explain the inverse association between legumes and risk of breast cancer.33


  We did not detect any association between breast cancer in premenopausal women and
  poultry intake. However, this association was significant for breast cancer in postmenopausal
  women. Intake of poultry was not associated with a lower risk of breast cancer in
  some other prospective studies.3 5 11 Poultry contains higher amounts of polyunsaturated
  fat than does red meat, and processing and cooking methods for poultry likely differ
  from that of red meat. Similar to the findings from recent meta-analysis of 11 prospective
  cohort studies with over 13 000 breast cancer events and over 687 000 participants,34
  we did not observe a clear association with fish intake. The results of the Singapore
  Chinese Health Study indicated that high consumption of fish has been inversely
  associated with breast cancer in postmenopausal women; this intake was higher than
  in our study.10


  A non-linear association between egg intake and breast cancer risk has been found
  in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition cohort.8 Although
  egg consumption has been associated with a borderline linear trend toward increased
  risk of breast cancer in premenopausal women in the Nurses’ Health Study,7 we found
  no evidence that intake of eggs in early adulthood was associated with breast cancers
  in premenopausal or postmenopausal women in the current analysis. The inconsistencies
  among the cohort study results may be due to chance or differences in the consumption
  level. The median intake of eggs in the highest fourth in our study population was
  0.43 eggs per day, smaller than the two eggs per day that have been significantly
  associated with a higher risk of breast cancer in a pooled analysis of eight cohort
  studies.3




  Potential limitations need to be considered. Because the participants were predominantly
  white, educated US adults, we cannot determine whether our findings are generalizable
  to other race or ethnic groups; however, race/ethnic specific risk factors for breast
  cancer have not been documented. Because dietary intake was assessed by food frequency
  questionnaires, some degree of measurement error is inevitably present, and thus
  to reduce measurement error we used the cumulative average of multiple measurements
  in a sensitivity analysis.


  Residual confounders are always of concern in any observational studies. Although
  we adjusted for a wide range of potential confounders for breast cancer, we still
  could not rule out the possibility that other unmeasured or inadequately measured
  factors have confounded the true association. We indirectly estimated the effects
  of substitution of legumes, poultry, and other protein sources for red meat on risk
  of breast cancer. Although trials on dietary modification would be ideal to support
  these substitutions, trials with sufficiently large sample sizes, long follow-up,
  and adequate compliance are not feasible. In addition, we made multiple comparisons
  in this analysis, and we cannot exclude the possibility of type I errors. However,
  the central finding of an association with red meat was a prior hypothesis.


  The strengths of this study include the large number of cases, length of follow-up,
  and ability to examine subtypes of breast cancers. The detailed prospective and
  updated assessments of diet and lifestyle factors allowed adjustment for many potential
  confounders. Recall bias would not be present because the study was strictly prospective
  and dietary assessment was conducted on all participants before the diagnosis of
  breast cancer.




  This analysis supports an association between higher consumption of total red meat
  during early adulthood and increased risk of breast cancer that was not clearly
  restricted to breast cancers in premenopausal women. Although the association was
  not significant in postmenopausal women alone, this may be due to lower statistical
  power in that group so we are not able to say with confidence that there is no association.
  In the current study, each serving per day increase in red meat was associated with
  a 13% increase in risk of breast cancer. When this relatively small relative risk
  is applied to breast cancer, which has a high lifetime incidence, the absolute number
  of excess cases attributable to red meat intake would be substantial, and hence
  a public health concern. Moreover, higher consumption of poultry was related to
  a lower incidence of breast cancer in postmenopausal women. Consistent with the
  American Cancer Society guidelines,35 replacement of unprocessed and processed red
  meat with legumes and poultry during early adulthood may help to decrease the risk
  of breast cancer. Further study of the relation between diet in early adulthood
  and risk of breast cancer is needed.
