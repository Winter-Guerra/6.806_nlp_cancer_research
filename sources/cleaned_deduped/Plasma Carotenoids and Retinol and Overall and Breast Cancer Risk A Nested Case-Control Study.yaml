  Experimental studies suggest that carotenoids and retinol may play a role in carcinogenesis,
  but epidemiological evidence is lacking. We investigated the prospective associations
  between plasma concentrations of major carotenoids and retinol, and overall and
  breast cancer risk. A nested case-control study included all first incident cancer
  cases diagnosed in the SU.VI.MAX cohort between 1994 and 2002. Baseline plasma concentrations
  of carotenoids and retinol were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography.
  Conditional logistic regression was used to assess odds ratios for an increase of
  0.1 μmol/L  and 95% confidence intervals. Plasma β-carotene and β-cryptoxanthin
  concentrations were inversely associated with overall cancer risk. Plasma β-cryptoxanthin
  concentration was inversely associated with breast cancer risk. The OR between plasma
  lycopene concentration and overall cancer risk was 1.07, Ptrend = 0.06. This association
  turned significant when excluding cancer cases diagnosed during the first year of
  follow-up. This prospective study suggests an inverse association between plasma
  concentrations of β-cryptoxanthin and both overall and breast cancer risk, and an
  inverse association between β-carotene and overall cancer risk. The direct association
  between lycopene concentration and cancer risk deserves further investigation.'
