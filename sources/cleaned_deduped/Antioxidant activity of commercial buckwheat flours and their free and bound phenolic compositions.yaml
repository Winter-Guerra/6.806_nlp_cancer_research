  activity of commercial buckwheat flours and their free and bound phenolic compositions.md
text: '


  Commercial buckwheat flours were investigated for their antioxidant activities,
  free, and bound phenolic compositions using spectrophotometer, LC-ESI-IT-MS, and
  LC-ESI-Q-TOF-MS. Farinetta flour contained the highest free and bound phenolic contents,
  followed by Supreme, whole buckwheat, and Fancy flour, respectively. The 50% ethanol
  extraction achieved significantly higher free phenolic content compared with water
  and absolute alcohol. The absolute ethanol extraction contained considerable more
  bound phenolic and flavonoid compounds. A high extraction temperature increased
  the phenolic contents. The optimal solvent to solids ratio was 50:1, and the optimal
  extraction time was 5 h for flavonoids. The spectral method was reproducible for
  analysing the total flavonoid contents. The LC-ESI-Q-TOF-MS studies on whole buckwheat
  flour showed that p-coumaric and gallic acids were found in the bound phenolics
  along with isoquercitrin but were not present in the free phenolic compounds. The
  free flavonol-glycosides were found in whole buckwheat flour but not in any other
  buckwheat flours.'
