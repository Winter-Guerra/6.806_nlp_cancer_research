  tumour development is dose-dependently inhibited by n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids
  in the MMTV-neundl-YD5 trans.md
text: "\n\nBreast cancer is attributable to modifiable risk factors including the
  intake of dietary n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. A key piece of evidence, yet
  to be addressed, that would demonstrate a causal relationship between n-3 PUFA and
  breast cancer, is a dose-dependent effect of n-3 PUFA on tumour outcomes. Thus,
  the objective of the present study was to determine whether n-3 PUFA reduces mammary
  gland tumor outcomes in a dose-dependent manner in female MMTV-neu-YD5 transgenic
  mice, an aggressive model of human breast cancer. \n\nHarems were provided one of
  three experimental diets comprised of 0, 3 or 9%  menhaden fish oil containing n-3
  PUFA. Female offspring were weaned onto the same parental diet and maintained on
  their respective diet for 20 weeks. Tumour onset, size and multiplicity were measured
  throughout the study. Fatty acid composition of mammary gland and tumours were determined
  by gasliquid chromatography. \n\nTumour size was significantly  reduced in a dose-dependent
  manner. n-3 PUFA were also incorporated in a dose-dependent manner; differential
  incorporation was observed for eicosapentaenoic and docosapentaenoic acids into
  mammary gland tissue, while docosahexaenoic acid was preferentially incorporated
  into tumours. \n\nOverall, the present study provides fundamental knowledge about
  the dose-dependent effect of n-3 PUFA on tumour outcomes in a pre-clinical model
  and also sheds light on the differential role of individual n-3 PUFA on tumour outcomes.

  cancer is more prevalent in Western countries, including Canada, than in Asian countries,
  such as Japan. However, the difference in incidence rates between Western and Asian
  societies is diminished when Asian populations migrate to Western countries. This
  suggests that environmental factors, including diet, may play a role in breast cancer
  development. The intake of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, which is high in Asian
  diets and low in Western diets, has been shown to be inversely correlated with breast
  cancer incidence, while n-6 PUFA consumption, high in Western diets, is associated
  with breast cancer incidence. Recent reviews and meta-analyses support a role for
  n-3 PUFA in breast cancer prevention. \n\nIn rodent and in vitro models, n-3 PUFA
  have been shown to reduce neoplastic growths. Previously, we have demonstrated the
  anti-tumourigenic effect of n-3 PUFA using the MMTV-neu-YD5 mouse model. Intake
  of a 3% weight/weight  menhaden fish oil based diet reduced tumour volume and burden
  by ~30% in comparison to mice receiving a 10%  n-6 PUFA diet. The MMTV-neu-YD5 mouse
  model over-expresses the neu oncogene which is homologous with the human epidermal
  growth factor receptor 2  gene found in humans. The over-expression of HER2 is estimated
  to be responsible for 20-25% of human breast cancer cases. The incorporation of
  n-3 PUFA into cellular and tumour lipids is hypothesized to be an important mechanism
  by which n-3 PUFA elicit their anti-tumourigenic effects. Other mechanisms include
  the competitive inhibition of arachidonic acid derived eicosanoids and the alteration
  of lipid rafts. \n\nWhile previous studies have shown that consuming n-3 PUFA at
  a single dose has the ability to reduce tumour growth, to the best of our knowledge
  no one has investigated the dose-dependent effect of n-3 PUFA in experimental rodent
  models. This fundamental knowledge is lacking and highly important for substantiating
  the cause-effect relationship between n-3 PUFA exposure and breast cancer outcomes.
  Thus, the present study examined the effect of increasing levels of n-3 PUFA, 0%,
  3% and 9%, on tumour onset, size, multiplicity and the incorporation of n-3 PUFA
  into phospholipids of tumours and their adjacent mammary glands using MMTV-neu-YD5
  mice. \n\nFinal body weights of mice on the 0% n-3 PUFA diet  were not significantly
  different than those of mice fed a 9% n-3 PUFA diet. However, mice fed either of
  the aforementioned diets had a significantly smaller final body weight than mice
  fed the 3% n-3 PUFA diet. Puberty onset was significantly  delayed in mice fed either
  the 3%  or 9%  n-3 PUFA diets compared to mice fed the 0% n-3 PUFA diet. \n\nTumour
  latency was not significantly different between the 3 groups, but average tumour
  latency, defined as the average age at which the first tumour was identified, was
  delayed in mice fed both 3% n-3 PUFA  and 9% n-3 PUFA  relative to 0% n-3 PUFA  fed
  mice. \n\nFigure 1. The average tumour latency of mice fed a 0%, 3%  and 9%  n-3
  PUFA diet. No significant difference existed between groups as determined by a one-way
  ANOVA. \n\nThe median age at which tumours were palpable  for the groups fed either
  the 0% or the 3% n-3 PUFA diets was 104 days, while the T50 for the group fed a
  9% n-3 PUFA diet was 110.5 days. \n\nFigure 2. The proportion of mice tumour free
  throughout the duration of the study fed a 0% n-3 PUFA diet, 3% n-3 PUFA diet, and
  9% n-3 PUFA diet. More mice remained tumour free longer in 3% and 9% n-3 PUFA fed
  mice. \n\nRepeated measures analysis demonstrated that mice fed the 9% n-3 PUFA
  diet had significantly reduced tumour multiplicity in comparison to mice fed either
  the 0% or 3% n-3 PUFA diet, beginning on days 115 and 122, respectively. This difference
  was maintained until the end of the study at 140 days. Final tumour multiplicity
  was reduced by 12% and 40% in the 3% and 9% n-3 PUFA fed mice, respectively, relative
  to the 0% n-3 PUFA fed controls. \n\nFigure 3. The average number of tumours palpitated
  per dietary intervention throughout the course of the study in mice fed a 0% n-3
  PUFA diet, 3% n-3 PUFA diet, and 9% n-3 PUFA diet. The asterisk indicates that mice
  fed a 9% n-3 PUFA diet had a significant reduction in tumour multiplicity in comparison
  to mice fed either of the other diets as determined by a repeated measures analysis.
  \n\nRepeated measures analysis demonstrated that average tumour volume began to
  diverge significantly at 117 and 120 days of age for mice fed a 9% n-3 PUFA diet
  in comparison to mice fed a 0% n-3 PUFA diet as well as a 3% n-3 PUFA diet, respectively.
  While mice fed a 3% n-3 PUFA diet had significantly reduced average tumour volume
  by day 133 in contrast to mice fed the 0% n-3 PUFA diet. Final tumour volume was
  ~35% and 70% lower in the 9% n-3 PUFA fed mice relative to the 3% and 0% n-3 PUFA
  fed mice, respectively. \n\nFigure 4. The average tumour volume per dietary intervention
  over the duration of the study in mice fed a 0% n-3 PUFA diet, 3% n-3 PUFA diet,
  and 9% n-3 PUFA diet. Groups with a different letter indicate significantly different
  tumour volumes as determined by a repeated measures analysis. \n\nThe incorporation
  of n-3 PUFA into PC within the mammary gland was assessed to determine if the observed
  effects were due to altered fatty acid composition of the plasma membrane. Compared
  to mice fed the 0% n-3 PUFA diet, there was preferential incorporation of eicosapentaenoic
  acid  and docosapentaenoic acid  in mice fed a 3% n-3 PUFA diet and further elevated
  in mice fed a 9% n-3 PUFA diet. Correspondingly, there was a significant  dose-dependent
  decrease in arachidonic acid. The n-6:n-3 PUFA ratio also significantly decreased
  \ from 23.8  8.5 in mice fed 3% n-3 PUFA  to 3.4  1.0 in mice fed the 9% n-3 PUFA
  diet. Also, the ratio of PUFA: saturated fatty acids  within PC was significantly
  reduced  in mice fed either a 3% or 9% n-3 PUFA diet  in comparison to mice fed
  the 0% n-3 PUFA diet. Similar effects were observed in the PE fraction. \n\nTable
  1. Fatty acid composition of the phosphatidylcholine fraction within mammary glands
  adjacent to tumours\n\nThere were significant differences in the fatty acid composition
  of the tumor PC fraction between groups. A significant  dose-dependent reduction
  was observed for linoleic acid  and AA in tumours of mice fed increasing levels
  of n-3 PUFA in comparison to mice fed 0% n-3 PUFA. There was also a dose-dependent
  increase in EPA accumulation into tumours of mice fed increasing levels of n-3 PUFA
  in comparison to mice fed 0% n-3 PUFA. DHA accumulation was only significantly greater
  in mice fed the 9% n-3 PUFA diet in comparison to mice fed 0% n-3 PUFA. A significant
  dose-dependent reduction  in tumour n-6:n-3 PUFA ratio was observed in both the
  3% and 9% n-3 PUFA diets  in comparison to mice fed the 0% n-3 PUFA diet. The ratio
  of PUFA: SFA was observed to be significantly reduced  in mice fed a 9% n-3 PUFA
  diet  compared to mice fed the 0% n-3 PUFA diet. Similar effects were observed in
  the PE, PS and PI fractions. \n\nThe present study addresses a fundamental question
  of causality by examining the dose response effect of n-3 PUFA on tumour outcomes
  in a pre-clinical model of breast cancer. Epidemiological studies to date only provide
  correlative evidence in support of a beneficial effect of n-3 PUFA in reducing the
  risk of developing breast cancer. Thus, a major gap remaining is demonstrating a
  cause-effect relationship in human or preclinical models. To the best of our knowledge
  a fundamental dose-dependent study of n-3 PUFA in breast cancer has not been previously
  reported. Thus, it is unknown whether effects at higher doses plateau or potentially
  cause harm. The results of this study provide evidence that the intake of n-3 PUFA,
  in a dose dependent manner results in a corresponding increase in n-3 PUFA in tumour
  phospholipids associated with a reduction in tumour outcomes.A key attribute of
  cause-effect relationships is demonstrating dose dependency. Multiple parameters
  in this study suggest a beneficial dose-dependent relationship across the 0%, 3%
  and 9%  levels of n-3 PUFA and tumour outcomes. On average, tumour latency was delayed
  by 2% and 9% in mice fed 3% and 9% n-3 PUFA diets, respectively. On average, the
  majority of mice were tumour free longer throughout the later time points in the
  3% and 9% n-3 PUFA fed groups when compared to the 0% n-3 PUFA fed group. Tumour
  multiplicity was significantly  decreased at the highest dose of 9% n-3 PUFA. Tumour
  volume was significantly  and dose-dependently decreased at all levels of treatment.
  \n\nThe current study showed a greater reduction in final tumour volume in mice
  fed a 9% n-3 PUFA diet in comparison to findings of previous studies in MMTV-neu
  mice. Yee et al.  fed mice either an 11%  corn oil diet  or a 10%  menhaden fish
  oil diet beginning at 78 weeks of age for the duration of a 61 week study. The study
  utilized the MMTV-neu mouse model, a less aggressive model than the one utilized
  in the current study. These investigators showed that a diet supplying 22.5% of
  total energy  from menhaden oil resulted in a 30% reduction in tumour volume. In
  contrast, a similar amount of energy provided by lifelong exposure to a 9% n-3 PUFA
  diet in the present study resulted in a 70% reduction in final tumour volume. These
  observations suggest a potential benefit of long term exposure to n-3 PUFA from
  conception through in utero development, lactation, weaning, puberty and adulthood
  confers added protection against mammary tumour development. This is supported by
  previous studies demonstrating that the timing of exposure may influence future
  cancer risk. \n\nIn regards to physiological relevance, the 9% n-3 PUFA diet provided
  mice with 22% of total calories from fat, but of greater relevance this diet provides
  6.7% of the total daily energy requirements from EPA and DHA, or the equivalent
  of 11 g/day in humans. In humans the consumption of 267 g of fish per day will provide
  approximately 11 g of EPA and DHA, or alternatively the equivalent of 3 servings
  of an average 85 g salmon steak. While the intake of 11 g of EPA and DHA per day
  may seem unrealistic, a study of 48 women demonstrated that intake of up to 9 capsules
  of marine based n-3 PUFA, providing up to 7.56 g of DHA + EPA a day, for 6 months
  was well tolerated by participants. The prescribed dosages produced similar levels
  of compliance among participants and a dose response accumulation of EPA and DHA
  was observed in serum and breast adipose tissue. In contrast, the equivalent quantity
  of EPA and DHA from the 3% n-3 PUFA diet is achievable in humans through the consumption
  of 3.4 g of EPA/DHA a day. Alternatively, the balance of n-6 to n-3 PUFA is another
  way to characterize the physiological relevance of the diets used in the present
  study. In Australia, the ratio of n-6 to n-3 PUFA in an individuals diet ranges
  from 2 to 80, which is similar to the variance of this ratio used in the present
  study. \n\nThe anti-tumourigenic properties of n-3 PUFA are largely related to their
  ability to incorporate into the plasma membrane of target tissues and alter membrane-protein
  and subsequently protein-protein interactions. The observed dose-dependent effects
  of a reduced n6:n-3 PUFA dietary intake were associated with a dose-dependent change
  in the fatty acid profile reflected in a decreased n-6:n-3 PUFA ratio, driven by
  increases in n-3 PUFA, mainly EPA, DPA and DHA, and a concomitant decrease in the
  n-6 PUFA, AA. These direct measurements importantly confirm that the bioactive components
  of the diet, n-3 and n-6 PUFA, are targeted to the mammary gland and tumour of interest,
  which coincided with reductions in tumour burden observed in the mice. Marine-based
  oils contain multiple n-3 PUFA, but the field has focused primarily on the study
  of EPA and DHA. However, the present study observed significant and appreciable
  incorporation of another n-3 PUFA, docosapentaenoic acid. The biological role of
  DPA is not known, but one previous study noted a similar observation. Thus, DPA
  deserves more attention in future studies regarding cancer. This is highly relevant
  given that DHA was only preferentially incorporated into tumour phospholipids but
  not into mammary gland phospholipids. While speculative, these observations suggest
  differential role of individual n-3 PUFA along the cancer trajectory. Further research
  is required to better define the interplay between individual and combinations of
  n-3 PUFA on tumour outcomes. \n\nThe present study did not examine mechanisms of
  action, but the change in membrane fatty acid composition is important as n-6 and
  n-3 PUFA compete for the same eicosanoid enzymes. The observed anti-tumourigenic
  effects of the diets utilized in this study may be due to a dose-dependent increase
  in n-3 PUFA consumption, a dose-dependent reduction in n-6 PUFA intake or a combination
  of the two with a dose-dependent reduction in the n-6:n-3 PUFA dietary ratio. Prostaglandins,
  leukotrienes and thromboxanes derived from AA promote inflammation and cellular
  proliferation; however, when they are derived from n-3 PUFA they promote apoptosis
  and inhibit cell proliferation. Additionally, n-3 PUFA have been found to elevate
  pro-apoptotic factors including caspases 9 and 3, Bcl2, and reactive oxygen species,
  while also reducing DNA synthesis, cellular proliferation and the integration of
  growth factor receptors into the plasma membrane. Changes in membrane composition
  were observed in both mammary and tumour tissue, but it is likely that the change
  in tumour composition is most relevant in explaining the anti-tumourigenic effects
  of n-3 PUFA. The control diet utilized in this study contained 10%  safflower oil
  which is abundant in LA and scarce in other n-6 PUFA. The n-6 and n-3 families of
  fatty acids refer to many structurally similar molecules which may have different
  biological effects. Thus, in this study, we can only conclude that in comparison
  to an LA rich diet, a fish oil diet rich in EPA and DHA is protective against tumour
  development. \n\nPubertal onset has been linked to breast cancer as earlier menarches
  place females at a greater risk for breast cancer. In the present study, the onset
  of puberty in the mice was significantly  delayed by ~3 days in mice fed either
  the 3% or 9% n-3 PUFA diets as compared to 0% n-3 PUFA fed mice. Mechanistically,
  n-3 PUFA may influence circulating estrogen levels, a key regulator of puberty.
  This observation suggests further investigation on the role of n-3 PUFA in regulating
  hormonal influences on puberty and cancer. Furthermore, this observation supports
  growing evidence that critical periods of early development such as puberty have
  important influences on future cancer risk. \n\nIn conclusion, the present study
  contributes importantly to addressing an important gap in our fundamental understanding
  of the causal role for n-3 PUFA in breast cancer prevention. \n\nMice were housed
  in ventilated cages in a humidity and temperature controlled environment on a 12
  hour light-12 hour dark cycle for the duration of the study. MMTV-neu-YD5 mice on
  an FVB background were obtained from Dr. William Muller at the University of McGill.
  Harems consisted of one male heterozygous MMTV-neu-YD5 mouse and three female FVB
  mice yielding progeny with a wildtype or a heterozygous genotype. Harems were fed
  a modified AIN93G diet  ad libitum containing 10% fat  providing 22% of the mouses
  total daily energy requirements. Mice received diets containing n-3 PUFA with different
  amounts  of menhaden fish oil. Diets comprised either 0% n-3 PUFA, n = 16); 3% n-3
  PUFA ; or 9% n-3 PUFA. The group receiving a diet containing 0% n-3 PUFA were used
  as a control as this is representative of a typical n-6 PUFA enriched, Western style
  diet. Offspring were weaned at 3 weeks of age and genotyped as described previously.
  Female MMTV-neu-YD5 transgenic offspring were maintained on their parental diet
  while males and wildtype females were euthanized post-weaning. Thus, female offspring
  received the same diet throughout life, from in utero until termination at 20 weeks
  of age. All experimental procedures were approved by the institutional animal care
  committee. \n\nPost-weaning, female mice were checked daily for vaginal opening
  to determine the onset of puberty. The body weights of mice were measured weekly
  from 3 to 20 weeks of age on an electronic scale. Beginning at week 12, mice were
  palpated three times a week to detect the presence of new mammary gland tumour formations.
  When a tumour was detected, biweekly measurements were taken for the duration of
  the study. Tumours were measured along the sagittal  and transverse  planes with
  the use of electronic calipers and tumour volume was calculated using the formula
  /2. \n\nWhen mice reached 20 weeks  of age a vaginal smear was taken by flushing
  the vagina with 30 L of a phosphate buffer saline solution. The solution was then
  placed on a glass slide and viewed under a Nikon Eclipse TS100 microscope for estrus
  cycle classification. Mice were identified as in proestrus, estrus, metaestrus or
  diestrus cycle by cell characteristics. Mice in proestrus, estrus or metaestrus
  were euthanized by carbon dioxide asphyxiation. Euthanization of mice in diestrus
  was delayed in order to control for hormonal fluctuations which may impact cell
  proliferation profiles. For ethical reasons mice which lost more than 20% of their
  body weight or possessed tumours which exceeded either 17 mm in length/width or
  more than 5000 mm3 in volume were euthanized prior to the 20 week time point. \n\nThe
  mouse pelt, with mammary glands  and tumors attached, was removed to allow for final
  tumour volume measurements via electronic calipers, and to remove the 4th and 5th
  MGs as well as all tumours. The tumours and MGs were excised and snap-frozen in
  liquid nitrogen. \n\nLipids were extracted from the 4th and 5th MGs  and tumour
  tissues  via the Folch Method  and separated into individual phospholipid classes
  by thin-layer chromatography. In brief, the entirety of a dissected MG adjacent
  to a tumour was homogenized on ice in 0.1 M KCl, added to 2:1 CHCl3: MeOH, vortexed
  and incubated overnight at 4C to facilitate lipid extraction. The same technique
  was utilized for tumour tissue; however, only 0.1 g of the tissue was homogenized.
  The following day samples were centrifuged at 357  g for 10 minutes, the chloroform
  layer was then collected and dried down under a gentle stream of nitrogen on a warm
  heating block. Dried down lipids from tumour tissues were reconstituted in chloroform
  to a concentration of 10 mg/ml. Samples from MGs were reconstituted in 200 L of
  chloroform. \n\nLipids were spotted on H-plates  which were activated by incubating
  the plates in an oven for an hour at 100C. Spotted H-plates were then placed in
  a thin layer chromatography tank containing 30 ml chloroform, 9 ml methanol, 25
  ml 2-propanol, 6 ml 0.25 M KCl, and 18 ml triethylamine. The plate was then lightly
  sprayed with 0.1%  ANSA  before being visualized under UV light. Bands corresponding
  to phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol  and phosphatidylserine
  \ were collected from tumour samples while only PC and PE bands were visible and
  collected from MG samples. \n\nMethylation was performed by adding 2 ml of hexane
  and 2 ml of 14% BF3-MeOH  to the samples and incubating them at 100C for 90 minutes.
  Following methylation, 2 ml of double distilled H2O was added to the samples and
  the solution was immediately vortexed for 30 seconds to halt methylation. Samples
  were centrifuged for 10 minutes at 357  g, the hexane layer was collected and dried
  down under nitrogen before reconstitution in 2 ml of hexane. Fatty acid methyl esters
  were analyzed using a gas chromatography system. Fatty acid composition was expressed
  as a percentage of total fatty acids. \n\nSAS v9.1 was utilized for all statistical
  analyses. A one-way ANOVA was conducted to determine differences in final body weights,
  puberty onset, tumour latency, final tumour volume, final tumour multiplicity and
  fatty acid compositions of tumour and MG tissues. The Kruskal-Wallis test was performed
  for data that was not normally distributed. A repeated measures analysis was utilized
  to detect differences in tumour volume and multiplicity between diets over the duration
  of the 20 week study. A p ; 0.05 was considered significant. \n\nPUFA: Polyunsaturated
