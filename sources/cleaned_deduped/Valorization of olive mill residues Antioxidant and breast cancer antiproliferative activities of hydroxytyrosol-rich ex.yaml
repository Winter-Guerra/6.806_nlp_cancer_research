  Phenolic composition, antioxidant and breast cancer antiproliferative activities
  of water and methanol/water derived extracts from olive pomace and dry olive mill
  residue, from Portuguese industries, were studied. DOR water extracts showed the
  highest extraction yield; as well as the highest total phenolic content and hydroxytyrosol.
  HPLC-ESI-MS analysis identified HT in both OP and DOR, whereas HT-1-glucoside, tyrosol,
  oleuropein aglycone isomers, verbascoside and oleuropein were only detected in DOR.
  Additionally, a de(carboxymethyl)oleuropein aglycone isomer, in aldehyde form, was
  reported for the first time in DOR. DOR water extract also presented the most effective
  DPPH scavenging capacity and antiproliferative activity, comparatively to OP water
  extract. Moreover, antioxidant potential of phenolic compounds present in DORW extract
  was comparable to HT, and to butylated hydroxyanisole, a widely used food industry
  antioxidant. Phenolic compounds present in DORW extract also showed comparable tumor
  antiproliferative activity on MDA-MB-231, relatively to HT and 5-fluorouracil, a
  well-known cytostatic agent. MDA-MB-231 cell growth inhibition, upon 5-FU incubation
  was even incremented in the presence of DORW extract.'
