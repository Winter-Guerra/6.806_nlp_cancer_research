  activity and chemical composition of different berry juices.md
text: '


  Total phenolics, total anthocyanins, mineral content, radical scavenging activity
  and antiproliferative activity against human cancer cell lines were evaluated in
  fresh pressed juices of five different berries. Total phenolic content ranged from
  133.0 to 260.3 mg of gallic acid equivalents/100 g of fresh weight, for red currant
  and black currant, respectively. Bilberry juice contained the highest amount of
  total anthocyanins. Significant correlation between total phenolics content and
  radical scavenging activity was observed. All examined juices showed antiproliferative
  activity in dose-dependent manner with IC50 ranging from 10.2 to 70.5 l/ml. Black
  currant juice was the most effective inhibitor of proliferation in all cell lines
  tested. Significant correlations of acidity and total anthocyanin content with antiproliferative
  activity of berry juices on HeLa cells, Fem X cells and MCF-7 cells were noticed.
  Berry juices are good sources of some minerals and contribute significantly to daily
  intake of these micronutrients.'
