  Aberrant glycosylation is a universal feature of cancer cells, and certain glycan
  structures are well-known markers for tumor progression. Availability and composition
  of sugars in the microenvironment may affect cell glycosylation. Recent studies
  of human breast tumor cell lines indicate their ability to take up and utilize fructose.
  Here we tested the hypothesis that adding fructose to culture as a carbon source
  induces phenotypic changes in cultured human breast tumor cells that are associated
  with metastatic disease. MDA-MB-468 cells were adapted to culture media in which
  fructose was substituted for glucose. Changes in cell surface glycan structures,
  expression of genes related to glycan assembly, cytoskeleton F-actin, migration,
  adhesion and invasion were determined. Cells cultured in fructose expressed distinct
  cell-surface glycans. The addition of fructose affected sialylation and fucosylation
  patterns. Fructose feeding also increased binding of leukoagglutinating Phaseolus
  vulgaris isolectin, suggesting a possible rise in expression of branching beta-1,
  6 GlcNAc structures. Rhodamine-phalloidin staining revealed an altered F-actin cytoskeletal
  system. Fructose accelerated cellular migration and increased invasion. These data
  suggest that changing the carbon source of the less aggressive MDA-MB-468 cell line
  induced characteristics associated with more aggressive phenotypes. These data could
  be of fundamental importance due to the markedly increased consumption of sweeteners
  containing free fructose in recent years, as they suggest that the presence of fructose
  in nutritional microenvironment of tumor cells may negatively affect the outcome
  for some breast cancer patients.'
