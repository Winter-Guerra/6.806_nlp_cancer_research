text: "\n\nThis study investigates the carbohydrate-hydrolyzing inhibitory potential
  of blueberry extract on carbohydrate-hydrolyzing enzymes and evaluates if the inhibitory
  activity is proanthocyanidin  or lower molecular weight phenolic dependent. Freeze-dried
  blueberry powder was extracted using acetone and subjected to C18 extraction. Low-molecular
  weight phenolics  and PACs  were separated from BAE with gel filtration chromatography
  using LH-20 column. Total phenolic content, PAC content, and phenolic profiles using
  HPLC, as well as rat -glucosidase, sucrase, and maltase inhibitory activities, were
  determined for all samples. The rat alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity of BAE
  \ was enhanced in BAE-LMW  and reduced in BAE-PAC. Similar trends were observed
  with maltase and sucrase inhibitory activities. Our findings suggest that blueberry
  acetone extract has inhibitory activity on carbohydrate-hydrolyzing enzymes and
  this effect is dependent on LMWs rather than PAC.\n\nAlpha-glucosidase inhibition

  once called non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, is a metabolic disorder that
  is characterized by high level of glucose in the blood. The disease is associated
  with high calorie diets as well as the consumption of high calorie sweetened foods.
  Worldwide, 347 million people have diabetes  resulting in immense health care costs.
  Type 2 diabetes accounts for 90 % of diabetes cases. In 2011, 79 million people
  in U.S.A. aged 20 years or older were classified as prediabetic. The American Diabetes
  Association defines prediabetic individual as an individual with blood glucose levels
  higher than normal  but not high enough to be considered diabetic. -Glucosidase
  inhibitors, such as acarbose, are the only oral anti-diabetes agent approved for
  the treatment of pre-diabetes. Briefly, lower doses of acarbose have shown to have
  beneficial effect toward pre-diabetes management by delaying the absorption of carbohydrates
  from the gut. Taking into consideration that pre-diabetes is not a disease would
  be more desirable to find natural components capable of reducing glucose absorption
  in the small intestinal environment, via inhibition of carbohydrate-hydrolyzing
  enzymes.\n\nDietary carbohydrates are digested by carbohydrate-hydrolyzing enzymes,
  resulting in monosaccharides, which are then absorbed through the small intestine.
  The carbohydrate-hydrolyzing enzymes break down polysaccharides, oligosaccharides,
  and disaccharides to monosaccharides. Alpha-glucosidases are expressed in small
  intestine and are a group of enzymes that hydrolyzes disaccharides such as sucrose,
  maltose, and lactose to monosaccharides. Therefore, inhibition of alpha-glucosidases
  \ can be an effective strategy to reduce the glucose absorption in the digestive
  tract. It has been reported that certain natural products are potentially good inhibitors
  of carbohydrate-hydrolyzing enzymes with their effect being attributed to the unique
  phenolic phytochemicals.\n\nBlueberries are great sources of various phenolic phytochemicals.
  Major cities of high-bush blueberry production in USA include California, Mississippi,
  North Carolina, Oregon, and Washington. More than half of all high-bush blueberries
  are shipped to the fresh market, to keep pace with the ever-increasing demand. The
  rest are frozen, pureed, concentrated, canned, or dried to be used in a wide range
  of food products including yogurt, pastries, muffins, cereals, and health bars.
  Previous reports evaluated a wide variety of different phenolic-derived blueberry
  health benefits. Some of the phenolic-derived health benefits of blueberries include
  anti-cancer activity, heart disease prevention, antioxidant activity, and anti-inflammatory
  effect. In addition, an animal trial using low-bush blueberries demonstrated that
  the phenolic-enriched fraction can enhance insulin sensitivity, which in turn can
  help manage Type 2 diabetes. A recent animal trial using obese and hyperglycemic
  C57BL/6 mice showed that administration of defatted soybean flour fortified with
  blueberry phenolics for 13 weeks reduces weight gain, improves glucose tolerance,
  and lowers fasting blood glucose levels. Another preliminary study showed that both
  high-bush and low-bush blueberries have a phenolic-dependent alpha-glucosidase inhibitory
  activity.\n\nPhenolic phytochemicals, secondary metabolites of plant origin, are
  important components of human diet. Major phenolic compounds present in blueberries
  include phenolic acids, anthocyanins, and proanthocyanidins. Proanthocyanidins  are
  condensed tannins which consist of oligomeric and/or polymeric flavans and flavan-3-ols.
  PACs can be classified as A-type or B-type depending on two interflavan linkages.
  Blueberries contain both A- and B-type PACs. B-type PACs in blueberry consist of
  dimers and higher oligomers of flavan-3-ol units linked through the C4C8 bond and/or
  the C4C6 bond. A-type PACs which are abundant in blueberries are flavan-3-ol units
  linked by additional ether bond between C2 and O7  with B-type.\n\nIt has been reported
  that blueberries have potential for type 2 diabetes prevention via carbohydrate-hydrolyzing
  enzyme inhibition. However, the source of the responsible bioactivities is not clear.
  Identification of the bioactive fraction for the inhibition of carbohydrate-hydrolyzing
  enzymes will assist in better understanding of blueberries utilization for the prevention
  of type 2 diabetes. The aim of this study was  to evaluate the inhibitory activity
  of blueberry extract against rat alpha-glucosidase, sucrase, and maltase and  to
  determine the true source of the responsible bioactivities between PACs and LMW
  phenolics.\n\nFreeze-dried whole blueberry powder was obtained from the U.S. Highbush
  Blueberry Council. The freeze-dried powder was kept at 4 C until use. All solvents
  used for research were of either ACS or HPLC grade and were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
  Rat intestinal acetone powder and all other reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.\n\nFive
  grams of blueberry powder were extracted with 100 mL of acetone solution which contained
  acetone, deionized water, and hydrochloric acid in the following volume ratio 70:29.9:0.01
  for 2 h at room temperature with continuous stirring. After the extraction with
  acetone solution, extracts were vacuum filtered through a Whatman #2  and evaporated
  to a final volume of 25 mL by a rotary evaporator.The extract was stored at 4 C
  until further testing.\n\nThe resulting extract  was subjected to solid phase extraction
  using C18 cartridge. A subsample  of the extract was loaded onto each pre-conditioned
  C18 cartridge, followed by rinsing with deionized water to eliminate hydrophilic
  compounds. After washing, the hydrophobic compounds  were eluted with 5 mL of 99:1
  \ methanol:acetic acid solution. The solvent was evaporated from the hydrophobic
  fraction using a rotary evaporator  at 60 C to yield a final volume of 25 mL. The
  evaporated extract was stored at 4 C until further testing.\n\nRoto-evaporated acetone
  extract was subjected to gel filtration chromatography using LH-20  column extraction
  to separate the low-molecular weight phenolic compounds from the high-molecular
  weight PACs. Five mL each of concentrated extracts was loaded onto 40 mL LH-20 column,
  which has been conditioned by washing with 200 mL of 30 % methanol. The column was
  washed with 500 mL of 30 % methanol to collect low-molecular weight phenolic compounds
  \ and with 150 mL of acetone:deionized water:acetic acid, the PAC-containing fraction
  was eluted. Both resulting fractions were roto-evaporated by vacuum rotor evaporator
  \ to final volume of 25 mL and then stored at 4 C until further testing.\n\nTotal
  phenolic content of all extracts was determined by FolinCiocalteaus reagent. Briefly,
  1 mL of sample or standard was mixed with 1 mL of 95 % ethanol, 5 mL deionized water,
  and 1 mL of 1 N FolinCiocalteu reagent  in test tubes. Then the tubes were incubated
  at room temperature for 5 min. After adding 1 mL of 5 % Na2CO3 into mixture, the
  mixture was stored at room temperature for 60 min in the absence of light. The absorbance
  was measured at 725 nm  after vortexing. Gallic acid standard was prepared  and
  used to establish the standard curve. Results were expressed as mg of gallic acid
  equivalents per gram of sample.\n\nTotal PAC contents were determined by the use
  of 4-dimethylaminocinnamaldehyde. DMAC reagent was prepared with 1:1 6 N H2SO4 and
  2 % DMAC  in methanol. 20 L of samples/standard, 2,380 L of methanol, and 100 L
  of DMAC reagent were added in cuvettes. The mixture was incubated at room temperature
  for 20 min. The absorbance of the mixture was observed at 640 nm. The calibration
  curve was established using PAC type A standards  at concentrations of 0, 30, 50,
  80, and 100 g/mL in ethanol. Results were expressed as mg of PAC type A equivalents
  per 1 mL of sample.\n\nAll samples were dissolved in water. A total of 0.3 g rat
  intestinal acetone powder was mixed with 9 mL of 0.9 % saline and sonicated  12
  times for 30 s at 4 C. After centrifugation   of the mixture, the supernatant was
  used as an enzyme mixture. 50 L of sample or buffer and 100 L of the enzyme mixture
  were added into a 96 microplate well.\n\nAfter incubation at 37 C for 10 min, 50
  L of 5 mM p-nitrophenyl--d-glucopyranoside  in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer  was
  added into each microplate well. In blank, 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer  was added
  for substrate instead of 5 mM pNPG. After incubation for 30 min, the absorbance
  of each mixture was measured at 405 nm and compared to the control using a microplate
  reader. Rat -glucosidase inhibitory activity was expressed by inhibition % and calculated
  as follows:\n\n$$ {\\text{ Inhibition }} = \\left \\times 100. $$\n\nAfter incubation
  at 37 C for 10 min, 50 L of 200 mM maltose in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer was
  added into the microplate well. In blank, 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer was added
  for substrate instead of 100 mM maltose solution. After incubation at 37 C for 30
  min, 10 L of the reaction mixture was transferred into pre-incubated 200 L glucose
  oxidase/peroxidase reagent for 10 min at 37 C. After incubation, the reaction was
  stopped by the addition of 200 L of 12 N H2SO4. The absorbance was measured at 540
  nm using a microplate reader. Maltase inhibitory activity was expressed by inhibition
  % and calculated as follows:\n\n$$ {\\text{ Inhibition }} = \\left \\times 100.
  $$\n\nAfter incubation at 37 C for 10 min, 50 L of 200 mM sucrose in 0.1 M sodium
  phosphate buffer was added into the microplate well. In blank, 0.1 M sodium phosphate
  buffer was added for substrate instead of 200 mM sucrose solution. After incubation
  at 37 C for 30 min, 25 L of the reaction mixture was transferred into pre-incubated
  100 L glucose oxidase/peroxidase reagent for 10 min at 37 C. After incubation, the
  reaction was stopped by the addition of 100 L of 12 N H2SO4. The absorbance was
  measured at 540 nm using a microplate reader. Sucrase inhibitory activity was expressed
  by inhibition % and calculated as follows:\n\n$$ {\\text{ Inhibition }} = \\left
  \\times 100. $$\n\nAll samples were filtered using a 0.45 m Fisherbrand syringe
  filter. An injection volume of 20 L of each sample was injected and analyzed using
  a reverse phase C-18 column. The mobile phase consisted of solvent A  and solvent
  B. Gradient elution was used under linear gradient conditions starting with 95 %
  A, decreasing to 65 % A over a 70-min time period at a flow rate of 0.75 mL/min.
  Phenolic and anthocyanin profiles were observed at 254 and 520 nm, respectively.\n\nAll
  experiments were performed at least three times in triplicates. Analysis at every
  time point from each experiment was carried out in triplicates. Means, standard
  errors, standard deviations, and IC50 values were calculated using Microsoft Excel
  XP.\n\nThe total phenolic content  of the resulting blueberry extracts was evaluated
  using FolinCiocalteaus assay. In blueberry extracts, the total phenolic contents
  of BAE, BAE-LMW and BAE-PAC were determined to be 3.88, 1.90, and 1.85 mg/mL, respectively.
  The total phenolic content results indicate that blueberry acetone extract contains
  both low MW phenolic compounds as well as PACs. Although the phenolic contents were
  similar between the BAE-LMW and BAE-PAC, the phenolic profiles were considered to
  be different. Demiray et al.  previously reported that acetone is an appropriate
  solvent to extract phenolic compounds and that elution solvents used in LH-20 column
  can affect the profile of received fractions.\n\nTotal phenolic contents  and PAC
  contents  of blueberry extract and resulting fractions\n\nThe PAC content was determined
  in BAE, and the resulting BAE-PAC and BAE-LMW using the DMAC assay. Our findings
  show that the majority of PACs were eluted in the BAE-PAC fraction. More specifically,
  the determined PAC contents were 0.86 mg/mL PAC A2 eq., 0.11 mg/mL PAC A2 eq. and
  0.61 mg/mL PAC A2 eq., for BAE, BAE-LMW and BAE-PAC samples, respectively.\n\nPrevious
  reports demonstrated that LH-20 column is a suitable method for PAC purification.
  Lee, evaluated five methods for PAC purification, and the results showed that size
  exclusion resins such as Toyopearl 40C and Sephadex LH-20 were the most suitable
  to purify PACs. Our findings are in agreement with previous reports, supporting
  that LH-20 column is suitable for PAC purification.\n\nThe dose-dependent rat -glucosidase
  inhibitory activities of BAE, BAAE-LMW, and BAE-PAC were investigated. For comparison
  purposes and to determine whether the observed bioactivity is PAC dependent, the
  inhibitory activities were expressed either based on total phenolic or PAC contents.
  Due to the low PAC contents observed in BAE-LMW fraction, the inhibitory activity
  of this fraction was not expressed based on PAC content. Our observations suggest
  that at the tested doses, all samples had significant rat alpha-glucosidase inhibitory
  activity. However, to assess the efficacy of the inhibition and understand whether
  the observed effect is PAC or low-molecular weight phenolic dependent, the IC50
  values on both total phenolic basis and PAC basis were determined. It was determined
  that the IC50 values for BAE were 0.390 mg/mL  and 0.090 mg/mL. BAE-LMW fraction
  had higher inhibitory activity with IC50 value of 0.242 mg/mL, while the BAE-PAC
  fraction had reduced inhibitory activity with observed IC50 values of 0.915 mg/mL
  \ and 0.299 mg/mL.\n\nDose-dependent rat -glucosidase inhibitory activities of blueberry

  a BAE, b BAE-PAC\n\nIC50 values of blueberry extract and fractions against rat -glucosidase,
  maltase, and sucrase   \n\nOur findings suggest that the observed rat alpha-glucosidase
  inhibitory activity is not PAC dependent, since the PAC basis IC50 value of BAE-PAC
  is higher when compared to the BAE. The results also indicated that the observed
  inhibitory activity is dependent on lower molecular weight phenolics, based on the
  lower TP basis IC50 value of BAE-LWM fraction than that of BAE. This is probably
  because non-bioactive higher MW phenolics have been removed and absent in BAE-LMW.\n\nIt
  is well documented that phenolic phytochemicals have alpha-glucosidase inhibitory
  activity that depends on the phenolic profile. A recent study reported that cinnamon
  extract has shown non-PAC-dependent rat alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity. Our
  observations were consistent with cinnamon, showing the inhibitory activity of blueberry
  acetone extract on rat alpha-glucosidase, which is attributed to lower molecular
  weight phenolic phytochemicals with no PAC dependency. To further confirm this observation,
  the specific sucrase and maltase inhibitory activities of BAE, BAE-LMW, and BAE-PAC
  were also investigated.\n\nThe dose-dependent maltase inhibitory activities of BAE,
  BAE-LWM, and BAE-PAC were evaluated as outlined in materials and methods. At the
  tested doses, only BAE and BAE-LMW extracts showed significant inhibitory activity.
  The IC50 values were evaluated for tested samples, on both total phenolics and PAC
  basis. It was determined that the IC50 values for BAE were 0.124 mg/mL  and 0.026
  mg/mL. As observed with alpha-glucosidase, BAE-LMW fraction had higher inhibitory
  activity with IC50 value of 0.070 mg/mL, while the BAE-PAC fraction had very low
  inhibitory activity resulting in IC50 values of &gt;1.853 mg/mL  and &gt;0.303 mg/mL.\n\nDose-dependent

  of maltase inhibitory activity in blueberry extracts confirm the findings from rat
  -glucosidase inhibitory activity, since BAE-PAC fraction has no inhibitory activity
  at the tested doses. In addition, the BAE-LMW fraction had higher inhibitory activity
  on TP basis, when compared to that of BAE. These findings suggest that the observed
  maltase inhibitory activity of BAE is attributed to lower molecular weight phenolics.\n\nThe
  dose-dependent maltase inhibitory activities of BAE, BAE-LWM, and BAE-PAC were evaluated
  as outlined in materials and methods. All evaluated samples showed significant inhibitory
  activity at the tested doses. The IC50 values for BAE were 0.027 mg/mL  and 0.006
  mg/mL. As observed with alpha-glucosidase, BAE-LMW fraction had higher inhibitory
  activity with an IC50 value of 0.016 mg/mL, while the BAE-PAC fraction had reduced
  inhibitory activity with observed IC50 values of 0.889 mg/mL  and 0.291 mg/mL.\n\nDose-dependent
  sucrase inhibitory activities of blueberry extracts on total phenolic content basis.

  of blueberry extracts on PAC content basis. a BAE, b BAE-PAC\n\nThese observations
  confirm our previous findings that the observed inhibitory activity of blueberry
  extract on carbohydrate-hydrolyzing enzymes depends on low-molecular weight phenolic
  compounds. It is also noteworthy that the observed sucrase inhibitory activities
  with BAE and BAE-LMW were significantly higher than those on maltase. This suggests
  that the observed carbohydrate-hydrolyzing enzyme inhibitory activity of blueberry
  acetone extract is mainly due to sucrase inhibition.\n\nThe phenolic profiles of
  BAE, BAE-LMW, and BAE-PAC at different wavelengths  were determined as described
  in the materials and methods. Our results showed as expected different phenolic
  profiles between the evaluated samples. More specifically, we observed that the
  majority of phenolic compounds present in BAE eluted in the BAE-LMW fraction. In
  the BAE-LMW fraction, the major peak was eluted around 17 min and the vast majority
  of other compounds eluted between 20 and 30 min. The compound eluted at 17 min had
  a max at 254 nm, suggesting that it is a phenolic acid, while the compounds eluted
  between 20 and 30 min had max at 520 nm, suggesting that they are anthocyanins.
  In the case of BAE-PAC fraction, the observed compounds eluted around 26, 31, 32,
  38, and 39 min. All these compounds were absent in the BAE-LMW fraction but present
  in the BAE phenolic profile.\n\nBased on our in vitro and HPLC observations, we
  can suggest that the bioactive components of blueberry acetone extract are considered
  to be either phenolic acids or anthocyanins, both of which are present in the BAE-LMW
  fraction. Further fractionation of the BAE-LMW is underway to separate and characterize
  phenolic acids and anthocyanins responsible for the observed effect.\n\nIn conclusion,
  our findings suggest that the inhibitory potential of blueberry extract against
  carbohydrate-hydrolyzing enzymes is shown to be attributed to low-molecular weight
  phenolics rather than PACs. Specifically phenolic acids and anthocyanins present
  in blueberries are considered to contribute to the bioactivity. Finally, we observed
  that blueberry extracts have shown higher inhibitory activity on sucrase, with much
  less on maltase. Our current findings provide a sound rationale for further fractionation,
  characterization, and evaluation of the low-molecular weight phenolic compounds
  present in blueberries, which will assist in better understanding the potential
  of blueberry bioactives for type 2 diabetes prevention. The ultimate goal of this
  work will be the development of the appropriate extraction and standardization procedures
  for the manufacture of a blueberry extract for type 2 diabetes prevention, to be
  used either in dietary supplements or food products.\n\nThis research was funded
