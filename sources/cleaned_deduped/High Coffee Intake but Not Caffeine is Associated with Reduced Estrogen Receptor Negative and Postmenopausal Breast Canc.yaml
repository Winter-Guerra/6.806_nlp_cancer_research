  Associations between caffeine and coffee consumption and breast cancer risk are
  uncertain, with studies suggesting inverse and null associations. Variation in cytochrome
  P450 1A2, a gene responsible for caffeine metabolism, may modify these associations.
  Cases were recruited through the Ontario Cancer Registry and controls through random
  digit dialing. Logistic regression was used to evaluate associations between breast
  cancer risk and intakes of 7 caffeine-containing items and total caffeine, and examine
  whether a genetic variant in CYP1A2 modified these associations. Analyses were stratified
  by estrogen receptor, menopausal, and smoking status. Generally, coffee and caffeine
  were not associated with breast cancer risk; however, a significant reduction in
  risk was observed with the highest category of coffee consumption . Variant rs762551
  did not modify associations. In stratified analyses, high coffee intake was associated
  with reduced risk of ER- and postmenopausal breast cancer. High coffee consumption,
  but not total caffeine, may be associated with reduced risk of ER- and postmenopausal
  breast cancers, independent of CYP1A2 genotype. Further studies are needed to replicate
  these findings.'
