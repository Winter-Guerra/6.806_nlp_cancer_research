  and Anti-Inflammatory Effects of Ginger in Health and Physical Activity Review of
  Current Evidence.md
text: '


  Ginger  belongs to the family Zingiberaceae. The health-promoting perspective of
  ginger is attributed to its rich phytochemistry. This study aimed to review the
  current evidence on ginger effects as an anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative.


  We searched MEDLINE for related publications using ginger and anti-oxidative and
  ginger and anti-inflammatory as keywords. This search had considered Papers that
  had been published between 2000 and 2010 without any filter.


  The anticancer potential of ginger is well documented and its functional ingredients
  like gingerols, shogaol, and paradols are the valuable ingredients which can prevent
  various cancers. This review concludes to favor ginger but some ambiguities necessitate
  further research before claiming its efficacy.


  Ginger  belongs to the family Zingiberaceae. It originated in South-East Asia and
  then used in many countries as a spice and condiment to add flavor to food. Besides
  this, the rhizome of ginger has also been used in traditional herbal medicine. The
  health-promoting perspective of ginger is attributed to its rich phytochemistry.
  Jolad et al. grouped fresh ginger into two wide range categories, i.e. volatiles
  and non-volatiles. Volatiles include sesquiterpene and monoterpenoid hydrocarbons
  providing the distinct aroma and taste of ginger. On the contrary, non-volatile
  pungent compounds include gingerols, shogaols, paradols, and zingerone.


  Ginger has staring potential for treating a number of ailments including degenerative
  disorders, digestive health, cardiovascular disorders, vomiting, diabetes mellitus,
  and cancer. It also has anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties for controlling
  the process of aging. Furthermore, it has antimicrobial potential as well which
  can help in treating infectious diseases. Generation of free radicals or reactive
  oxygen species  during metabolism beyond the antioxidant capacity of a biological
  system results in oxidative stress, which plays an essential role in heart diseases,
  neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, and in the aging process. The bioactive molecules
  of ginger like gingerols have shown antioxidant activity in various modules.


  Inflammatory disorders such as gastritis, esophagitis, and hepatitis, which are
  caused not only by infectious agents such as viruses, bacteria, and parasites but
  also by physical and chemical agents like heat, acid, cigarette smoke, and foreign
  bodies, are recognized as risk factors for human cancer. Ginger consumption before
  exercise might reduce naturally occurring quadriceps muscle pain during moderate-intensity
  cycling exercise. This effect may be due to anti-inflammatory effect of ginger and
  further investigation need to prove it in human.


  This study aimed to review the current evidence on ginger effects as an anti-inflammatory
  and anti-oxidative.


  We conducted a comprehensive search in the following databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE,
  in order to identify relevant studies. The electronic search was conducted in July
  2012, and developed in collaboration with an experienced librarian. Time restriction
  were applied to year of publication from 2000-2012 and we used literatures only
  from English language and studied both human and animal models. All titles and abstracts
  were examined that met our search terms and full publications were reviewed, when
  necessary. Medline search with the terms:  AND  and  AND, then we had 211 articles.
  Review articles were only included in this review if they offered new insights or
  opinions. We could achieve only to 59 articles from these articles and summarized
  12 full text studies in the table.


  The rich phytochemistry of ginger includes components that scavenge free radicals
  produced in biological systems. For the purpose of energy production, some free
  radicals which generated during the process of oxidation are essential. Increased
  production of free radicals results in oxidative stress that can lead to DNA damage.
  In such circumstances of imbalance, extra antioxidant supplementation through dietary
  modules is essential for organism vitality. The anti-oxidative properties of ginger
  and its components have been explored in various in vitro and in vivo tests. Strengthening
  the bodys defenses by improving the antioxidant status will undoubtedly protect
  human against many chronic diseases. 6-Shogaol has exhibited the most potent antioxidant
  and anti-inflammatory properties in ginger, which can be attributed to the presence
  of alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone moiety. Animal modeling showed that ginger significantly
  lowered induced lipid peroxidation and raised the levels of antioxidant enzymes,
  together with serum glutathione. Furthermore, feeding ginger to rats at 1% w/w during
  administration of malathion  for 4 weeks significantly attenuated malathion-induced
  lipid peroxidation. Concomitant dietary feeding of ginger  significantly attenuated
  lindane-induced lipid peroxidation, reduced glutathione, and the GSH-dependent enzymes
  glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, and glutathione S-transferase. In
  vitro, zingerone scavenged O2- and OH and suppressed lipid peroxidation, so it can
  possibly value in treatment of Parkinsons disease.


  Ethanol significantly decreased the superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione
  peroxidase, glutathione reductase, and glutathione content in the hepatic tissue.
  This effect was improved by a treatment with 1% dietary ginger 1 month in rats which
  suggest that ginger may have protective role against the ethanol induced hepatotoxicity.
  Ginger and Arabic Gum showed renoprotective effects in renal failure. These protective
  effects may be attributed to their anti-inflammatory properties by attenuating serum
  C-reactive protein levels and antioxidant effects by reducing lipid peroxidation
  marker, malondialdehyde levels, and increasing renal superoxide dismutase activity.
  They could be beneficial adjuvant therapy in patients with acute and chronic renal
  failure to prevent disease progression and delay the need for renal replacement
  therapy.


  In one study, ethanol extract of Z. officinale alone and in combination with vitamin
  E partially ameliorated cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity. This protection is mediated
  by renal antioxidant defense system.


  In the other study, the protective effect of the ginger extract was examined on
  CCl  and acetaminophen-induced liver damage and indicated that Z. officinale could
  be useful in preventing acute liver injury.


  The overall evaluation of one study concludes that both spices ginger and cumin
  have good antioxidant potential, particularly fresh ginger. Methanol extracts of
  all the samples were found to have better antioxidant action than the n-hexane extracts.
  There was also a good correlation between the total phenolic content and antioxidant
  activities of the non-volatile extracts.


  Rat studies showed that ginger has an equal antioxidant effect to that of ascorbic
  acid.


  Ghasemzadeh et al. validated the medicinal potential of the leaves and young rhizome
  of Z. officinale  and the positive relationship between total phenolics content
  and antioxidant activities in Z. officinale.


  In ancient cultures, medical practitioners focused on herbs for promoting the immune
  systems of body. In many countries ginger and its products raise the immune system.


  Gingerol, shogaol, and other structurally-related substances in ginger inhibit prostaglandin
  and leukotriene biosynthesis through suppression of 5-lipoxygenase or prostaglandin
  synthetase. Additionally, they can also inhibit synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines
  such as IL-1, TNF-, and IL-8. In another investigation, Pan et al. showed that in
  macrophages, shogaol can down-regulate inflammatory iNOS and COX-2 gene expression.
  Jung et al. indicated that rhizome hexane fraction extract of Z. officinale inhibited
  the excessive production of NO, PGE, TNF-alpha, and IL-1beta. Because of potent
  compounds in ginger rhizome for inhibiting allergic reactions, it may be useful
  for the treatment and prevention of allergic diseases.


  Habib et al. showed that ginger extract can reduce the elevated expression of NFB
  and TNF- in rats with liver cancer. The activation of NF-B is linked to a variety
  of inflammatory diseases, including cancer, atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction,
  diabetes, allergy, asthma, arthritis, Crohns disease, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimers
  disease, osteoporosis, psoriasis, septic shock, and AIDS.


  Lantz et al. showed that gingerols can inhibit LPS-induced COX-2 expression while
  shogaol containing extracts has no effect on COX-2 expression. These data demonstrate
  that important compounds in ginger are capable of inhibiting PGE  production.


  Studies evaluating the effectiveness of ginger in patients with osteoarthritis have
  controversial results. One study showed ginger extract to have a statistically significant
  effect on reducing symptoms of osteoarthritis of the knee. In another study, the
  effect of ginger in osteoarthritis was significant only in the first period of treatment.
  In gout as a rheumatic disease of joints, -shogaol has strong anti-inflammatory
  and antioxidant effects and can be used as a curative agent.


  Black et al. showed that treatment of patients with has hypo-algesic effects. They
  used 2 g of ginger supplementation for 11 days of on 36 participants to cure muscle
  pain. They proved that daily consumption of raw and heat-treated ginger resulted
  in moderate-to-large reductions in muscle pain.


  However, cohort studies and controlled trails in sort of in vivo and in vitro need
  to be to warrant the pharmacological applications of ginger.


  The mechanism of ginger for acting as chemopreventive spice remains a matter of
  conflict among researchers. Ingredients like -gingerol,-shogaol, -paradol, and zerumbone
  in ginger exhibits anti-inflammatory and antitumorigenic activities. Ginger and
  its bioactive molecules are effective in controlling the extent of colorectal, gastric,
  ovarian, liver, skin, breast, and prostate cancers.


  Colorectal cancer is more prevalent in vegetarians and ginger could be effective
  in reducing the extent of this disease. Manju and Nalini studied the efficacy of
  ginger against 1, 2 dimethylhydrazine -induced colon cancer. They observed that
  ginger supplementation can activate various enzymes such as glutathione peroxidase,
  glutathione-S-transferase, and glutathione reductase and suppress colon carcinogenesis.
  Kim et al. administered Zerumbone orally in mouse models and observed inhibition
  in multiplicity of colonic adenocarcinomas through suppression of colonic inflammation
  in a dose-dependent manner. The mechanism of that includes inhibition of proliferation,
  induction of apoptosis, and suppression of NF-B and heme oxygenase -1 expression.


  In gastric cancer, the tumor necrosis factor-related inducing apoptosis ligand  plays
  a major role by promoting apoptosis. Cascades of caspase proteins activate by ginger
  and its functional components. Ishiguro et al. explained a model for -gingerol and-shogaol
  action against gastric cancer cells. They observed that -gingerol inhibits TRAIL-induced
  NF-B activation by impairing the nuclear translocation of NF-B, suppresses cIAP1
  expression, and increases TRAIL-induced caspase-3/7 activation.


  Yagihashi et al. reported that -gingerol can inhibit both proliferation and invasion
  of hepatoma cells. Cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induction are the main causes
  of -gingerol in these cancerous cells. Habib et al. suggested that ginger extract
  can reduce the elevated expression of NF-B and TNF-alpha in rats with liver cancer.


  Inhibition of angiogenesis in the mouse skin is the mechanism of ginger for treating
  of skin cancer.-Gingerol exhibited considerable cytotoxicity by growth inhibition
  of human epidermoid carcinoma cells mediated via reactive oxygen species  induced
  apoptosis.


  The effectiveness of ginger and its biomolecules has been demonstrated for controlling
  of ovarian cancer. Ginger inhibited NF-B activation and diminished the secretion
  of VEGF and IL-8 helping to treat ovarian cancer.


  Zhang et al. showed that zerumbone induced apoptosis in pancreatic carcinoma cells
  through p53 signal pathway, formation of apoptotic bodies, condensed nuclei, and
  the increased activity of caspase-3. So, zerumbone is a new therapeutic candidate
  for controlling of pancreatic cancer. Lee et al. indicated that ginger can cure
  breast cancer via inhibiting cell adhesion invasion motility.-gingerol can affect
  prostate cancer models by modulation of proteins involved in apoptosis pathway.


  Some research studies have proved the effectiveness of ginger against diabetes and
  its complications. Weidner and Sigwart conducted an experimental study and indicated
  that ginger extract with a high content of gingerols and shogaols did not induce
  significant changes in blood glucose, blood coagulation, blood pressure, and heart
  rate in rat models. However, ginger significantly lowered blood glucose, serum total
  cholesterol, LDL, VLDL, and triglycerides, and raised HDL in hyperglycemic rats,
  in models that are diabetic, deficient in the apolipoprotein E gene or those that
  have been fed a high lipid diet. Bhandari et al. showed that ethanolic extract of
  Zingiber officinale fed orally for 20 days produced a significant antihyperglycaemic
  effect  in diabetic rats. Additionally, Nammi et al. indicated that the ethanolic
  extract of ginger reduced body weights and levels of glucose, insulin, total cholesterol,
  LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, free fatty acids, and phospholipids in high-fat
  diets. Heimes et al. supported from this hypoglycemic potential, too. Insulinoptropic
  properties of ginger and glucose-lowering potential were explained by Islam and
  Choi.


  The health-promoting perspectives of ginger are well known. It can treat a wide
  range of diseases via immunonutrition and anti-inflammatory responses. As a result
  of anti-inflammatory effect of ginger, it can reduce muscle pain after intense physical
  activity. Likewise, the anticancer potential of ginger is well documented and its
  functional ingredients like gingerols, shogaol, and paradols are the valuable ingredients
  which can prevent various cancers, angiogenesis and metastasis, induction of apoptosis,
  and inhibition of cell-cycle progression. Besides these, it improves cardiovascular
  disorders, diabetes mellitus, and gastrointestinal health.


  This review concludes to favor ginger but some ambiguities necessitate further research
  before claiming its efficacy.
