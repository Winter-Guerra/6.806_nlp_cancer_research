  compounds in apple fruit and juice, with special reference to their health related
  properties. As phytochemical molecules belonging to polyphenols are numerous, we
  will focus on the main apples phenolic compounds with special reference to changes
  induced by apple cultivar, breeding approaches, fruit postharvest and transformation
  into juice. \n\n\nanthocyanidins; anthocyanins; flavanols; flavonols; phenolic acids;
  hydroxycinnamates; phytochemical compounds; \n\n\n\nIn the last few decades the
  attention of markets to new products, having nutraceutical properties, i.e., able
  to decrease the risk of diseases, has boosted scientific research to identify and
  characterize antioxidant properties, molecules in food products, and their derivates.
  The development of functional foods with health-beneficial properties is one of
  the main goals of food science research.\n\nOne class of molecules that has significant
  health properties is that of polyphenols. In general terminology, they are considered
  as a: “Structural class of mainly natural, organic chemicals compounds characterized
  by the presence of large multiples of phenol structural units” . In a more strict
  definition , the name “polyphenol” should be used to identify: “Plant secondary
  metabolites derived exclusively from the shikimate-derived phenylpropanoid and/or
  the polyketide pathway(s), featuring more than one phenolic ring and being devoid
  of any nitrogen-based functional group in their most basic structural expression”.\n\nPolyphenols
  are usually divided into several different groups on the basis of the number of
  carbon atoms in conjunction with the structure of the basic phenolic skeleton .
  They originate from the plant aromatic pathway, starting with amino acids of the
  shikimate pathway and culminating in molecules produced by the phenyl propanoid
  and flavonoid pathways. The coordinated induction-regulation of these pathways leads
  to the production of several thousand different molecules.\n\nThe general role of
  phenolic compounds in plant physiology and allelopathy has been acknowledged a long
  time ago and is still actively studied by plant scientists. More recently, these
  secondary metabolites, which naturally and abundantly occur in fruits, have been
  rediscovered by human nutritionists as beneficial molecules and potentially interesting
  components for the production of functional food. Their positive effects on human
  health were first proposed in 1936 , and the scientific consensus is now common
  as proven by the remarkable increase in the number of scientific publications where
  the “polyphenols” term appears.\n\nFigure 1. Number of publications, which include
  polyphenol research, since 2000. Publications registered in the ScienceDirect database
  \ where the keyword “polyphenols” is used. The 2013 data are related to the period
  of January–mid-July. \n\n\nFigure 1. Number of publications, which include polyphenol
  research, since 2000. Publications registered in the ScienceDirect database  where
  the keyword “polyphenols” is used. The 2013 data are related to the period of January–mid-July.\n\nSeveral
  excellent reviews are focused on the health related effects and bioavailability
  of polyphenols in human nutrition . Originally the main health claims for polyphenols
  were based on their properties as scavengers of free radicals and reactive oxygen
  species. However, while polyphenols may have a significant antioxidant in vitro
  activity, the absorption into the human body is more complex , and intact forms
  of complex dietary polyphenols have limited bioavailability. Consequently, the circulating
  level in plasma is low and a major part of polyphenols persists in the colon where
  they undergo further metabolic changes before entering the systemic circulation.
  For such reasons, it is still in doubt if polyphenols can make a significant contribution
  to free-radical scavenging activity in human as shown for other antioxidant molecules,
  such as ascorbic acid . However, the cancer preventive effects of green tea polyphenols
  can arise by induced antioxidative or pro-oxidative effects, and the importance
  of such effects may depend on the stage of carcinogenesis . These authors suggested
  that the increased endogenous antioxidant capacity may be more important prior to
  carcinogen exposure, whereas pro-oxidant cell killing effects may be more important
  in clearing transformed cells from the body and thus limiting tumour growth. More
  recently, several dietary polyphenols have been shown to influence epigenetic processes
  such as DNA methylation processes , hystone modification, and microRNA expression
  . Polyphenol induced epigenetic changes may explain the chemo-preventive roles of
  these molecules in preventing cancer and other diseases in humans but further studies
  are needed.\n\nIn addition to their health promoting properties in humans, polyphenols
  are induced in plants under oxidative stress conditions and support the activity
  of other important cellular antioxidant compounds such as glutathione, α-tocopherol,
  ascorbic acid, and enzymes such as peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase. Phenolic
  compounds accumulated in plant organs, according to species characteristics, and
  are usually more abundant in the epidermal tissue of the organs, such as in the
  peel of fruit. This preferential localization is set in relation with effect of
  light on the phenolic metabolism, as well as, with the protective role of phenolic
  compounds against ultraviolet radiations and other abiotic and biotic stressors
  .\n\nThe aim of this article is to revise the scientific literature on the biochemical
  and antioxidant characterization of apple fruit at harvest, and the possible strategies
  and solutions for maintaining these properties. As phytochemical compounds could
  undergo relevant modifications during fruit storage and processing in juice, these
  aspects will be analyzed and discussed.\n\n\n\nApples are one of the most commonly
  consumed fruits in the world. In 2011, world apple production was estimated at around
  75 millions of tons according to Food and Agriculture Organization stats . Apple
  are eaten both raw and as processed products, such as cider, juice, and puree. The
  famous sentence: “An apple a day keeps the doctor away!” is what is highly recommended
  and heavily advertised nowadays to the general public to stay fit and healthy. This
  claim is due to the high nutraceutical values of the apple’s compounds and to the
  large abundance and accessibility of this fruit in the market, and, due to postharvest
  storage technology, fruit shelf life can be extended for up to one year, depending
  on the variety. Although apples are one of the most consumed fruits in the word
  it is important to note that they are not those with the greatest phenolic content
  and antioxidant capacity. In fact, total phenolic contents of 62 fruits using the
  Folin-Ciocalteu method showed values ranging from 11.88 to 585.52 mg GAE/100 g of
  wet weight. In this wide range, apples belonging to green-delicious, red-delicious,
  and rose-red cultivars showed intermediate values of 68.29, 73.96, and 70.57 mg
  GAE/100 g of wet weight, respectively . Specific studies aimed at comparing total
  polyphenols in commercial and ancient apple cultivars were performed by Iacopini
  et al.  and Minnocci et al. . These studies showed that cultivar effects can be
  relevant as total polyphenol content range between 56 and 221 mg GAE/100 g of wet
  weight in Gala and Panaia red cultivars, respectively. These results prove that
  the genetic variability within apple germplasm can provide significant genetic variation
  for polyphenol traits.\n\nFigure 2. Total phenolic content in different fruits and
  apple cultivars. Data were re-elaborated from Fu et al. —red bars; Iacopini et al.

  fruits and apple cultivars. Data were re-elaborated from Fu et al. —red bars; Iacopini
  et al. , and Minnocci et al. —blue bars.\n\n\n\nApples contain a variety of phenolic
  compounds  and, using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry or gas chromatography
  mass spectrography analysis methods, it is possible to detect several polyphenolic
  molecules, such as-catechin and-epicatechin, phloridzin, quercetin, cyaniding, cyanidin-3-O-galactoside,
  chlorogenicacid, and hydroxycinnamates . In general, the polyphenolic contents per
  fruit ranges between 19.6 and 55.8, 17.7–33.1, and 10.6–80.3 mg per apple; the lowest
  values were recorded for phloridzin and anthocyanin .\n\nTotal phenolic, flavonoid,
  and anthocyanin contents in four apple varieties were compared in flesh and peel
  . The total phenolic contents of the peel were highest in Idared and Rome Beauty
  and drop to 75.7 and 93.0. For flavonoids, the Idared peel contains 303.2 mg of
  catechin equivalents/100 g, corresponding to six times higher concentrations than
  in flesh. Anthocyanins were detected only in peel, ranging from trace amount in
  Golden Delicious to 26.8 mg of cyanidin 3-glucoside equivalents/100 g of peel in
  Idared. The cumulative sum of polyphenols, expressed on a per apple basis, was determined
  on 10 apple cultivars coming from different regions and growing conditions in New
  Zealand, and varies between 263.1 and 97.7 mg of total phenolics per apple in Pacific
  Queen to Cox’s Orange cultivar, respectively .\n\nFigure 3. Polyphenol molecule
  concentrations ranges in seed, peel and peel + flesh. Data were re-elaborated form,

  peel and peel + flesh. Data were re-elaborated form, Łata et al. , Duda-Chodak et
  al. , and Iacopini et al. .  mg/g DW;  mg/100 g FW; - not measured.\n\nDeeper characterization
  of apples polyphenol molecules associated with their localization in peel, flesh,
  and seeds, prove that peel, and also seeds, are rich in these compounds . A schematic
  representation of concentration ranges of specific polyphenols in peel , peel and
  flesh  and seeds , is presented in Figure 3. In addition, seeds are usually discharged
  when eating apple fruit, the peel can provide a significant fraction of the phenolics,
  becoming an important donor of these compounds as confirmed by the literature .
  Flesh and peel values for-catechin,-epicatechin, phloridzin, quercetin, cyanidin-3-O-galactoside
  ranges between 0.45–3.4, 5.18–18.40, 0.64–9.11, 0.10–0.22, and not detectable-3.11
  mg per 100 g fresh weight, respectively .\n\n\n\nEvidence suggests that a diet rich
  in apples may reduce the risk of diseases. For polyphenols, apples are fruits for
  which numerous data are available , and each polyphenol molecule might have specific
  health benefits. For example, the non-glycosilated form of phlorizin, phloretin,
  has been shown to influence epigenetic processes, heritable changes not encoded
  in the DNA sequence itself that play an important role in gene expression regulation
  in breast cancer cells . Other polyphenols, such as quercetin, are efficient inhibitors
  of sulfotransferases , and may change the activity of thyroid hormones, steroids,
  and catecholamines .\n\nMultiple and important mechanisms of cancer are affected
  by apple components, more specifically by oligomeric procyanidins. These effects
  embrace in vitro antimutagenic activity, modulation of carcinogen metabolism, antioxidant
  activity, anti-inflammatory mechanisms, modulation of signal transduction pathways,
  anti-proliferative, and apoptosis-inducing activity, as well as novel mechanisms
  on epigenetic events and innate immunity .\n\nApple polyphenols may also have beneficial
  effects on outcomes related to Alzheimer’s disease. Apple juice may work in cognitive
  decline of normal aging suppressing over expression of presenilin-1, which is linked
  to the production of amyloid b peptide, a marker of Alzheimer’s .\n\nThe phloretin-O-glycosides,
  phloretin-2′-O-glucoside and phloretin-2′-O-(2″-O-xylosyl) glucoside, are thought
  to be unique to apples and apple products. Their role on inhibition of sodium-dependent
  glucose transporters in the intestinal lumen, is proven with special emphasis for
  phloretin-2′-O-glucoside . By decreasing the absorption of glucose, phloretin-2′-O-glucoside
  may, therefore, reduce post-prandial blood glucose levels, and it is thought this
  action may be beneficial to the treatment of diabetes mellitus. The authors suggested
  an interesting role for apple polyphenols related to glucose control in diabetes
  .\n\nThe potential role of apple polyphenols to reduce or prevent injury to gastric
  mucosa by drugs was investigated in a combined study using cell and animal models.
  The apple extract tested that was highest in chlorogenic acid protected cells from
  oxidative damage, moreover, the fraction highest in catechin also protected cells
  from oxidative damage in a dose-dependent manner .\n\nIn animal models, apples have
  been shown to prevent skin, mammary, and colon carcinogenesis, while in epidemiological
  observations indicated that regular consumption of one or more apples a day may
  reduce the risk for lung and colon cancer . An Italian research group studying the
  effects of ten weeks of fresh Annurca apple intake in aged rats, found that regular
  apple consumption in aged rats restored synaptic function to the level of younger
  animals .\n\nApples fruit, as well apple juice and other derivate products, have
  a rich phytochemical profile suggesting their potential to affect the health of
  the populations consuming them . A hospital-control study including over 6000 participants
  from various geographical areas in Italy examined the association between fresh
  apple intake and risk of cancer . Data were based on interviews of dietary intake
  in the two years prior to diagnosis. It was found that consuming one, or more than
  one, apple per day was associated with a reduction in risk of cancer compared to
  consumption of less than one apple per day. Furthermore, a hospital-based case-control
  study carried out in Poland showed a significant beneficial effect of apple consumption
  on the risk of colorectal cancer. The dietary interviews focused on food-frequency
  and quantity, and proved that apples were the most frequent fruit consumed in the
  study population. Out of several types of fruits in the study, which included citrus,
  berries, and stone fruits, apple was the only specific type of fruit associated
  with a significant reduction of colorectal cancer risk .\n\nFinally, an evaluation
  of cardiovascular protective effect of different apple varieties on rats proved
  that catechin, epicatechin, and procyanidin B1 polyphenols are the major compounds
  responsible for the cholesterol lowering ability of apples .\n\n\n\nIn apple, as
  in other fruits, the variability of polyphenols profile is influenced by cultivar,
  ripening stage, growing season, environmental factors, geographic region, production
  techniques, and storage conditions . Due to the evidence that polyphenol content
  is largely cultivar dependent, different results have been described in the literature
  dealing with apple fruit postharvest storage. Carbone and collaborators  studied
  the influence of genotype, tissue type, and cold storage on bioactive compounds
  of different apple cultivars. Authors showed that total phenol content was dramatically
  reduced after cold storage in flesh and peels of apple Hillwell, but not in the
  other cultivars. More complex results were found by Begić-Akagićand collaborators
  . These authors showed that apple phenolic content in relation to storage time slightly
  decreased in three common apple cultivars and three autochthonous apple cultivars
  from Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nShelf life at ambient temperature proved that phenol
  contents of apple Golden Delicious, Pinova, Mairac, and Honey crisp cultivars did
  not change and an increase of these compounds was even observed for Wellant cultivar.
  A significant decrease in phenol content was measured in Topazin comparison to that
  measured at harvest . Finally, Napolitano and collaborators  observed an increase,
  in the flesh of Annurca, of catechin and phloridzin related to antioxidant activity
  during cold storage.\n\nSuch remarkable variability determines a difficult comparison
  among data, so we avoid a deep review of this literature and focus our attention
  on the main quantitative and qualitative changes of phenolic compounds during fresh
  fruit transformation and storage processes. The different concentrations of phenols
  in apple fruit tissues affects processed products phenolic quality and it has been
  well demonstrated that, during processing of primary products, the antioxidant capacity
  of apple may be lost. In particular, the general loss of antioxidant capacity starts
  as soon as the integrity of the cell is broken and enzymes, such as esterases, glycosidases,
  and decarboxylases, may start to catalyse the transformations and degradations of
  phenolic compounds .\n\nFor processed apple products, the most popular is apple
  juice. During its production, only a fraction of phenolic compounds are extracted,
  while the other remains in the pomace . Due to the fact that peel and seeds are
  discharged during juice production, phenolic compounds such as quercetin glycosides
  and dihydrochalcones, are found in small amounts in apple juice . Apple pomace is
  the “waste” product generated during apple juice processing. Lu and Foo  investigated
  apple pomace as a potential source of natural polyphenols for use as dietary or
  food antioxidants. In this study, apple Gala polyphenols purified from pomace exhibited
  high antioxidant activities: three-times the DPPH-scavenging and 10–30 times superoxide-scavenging
  activities of vitamins C or E. According to the taste of consumers, apples are processed
  in clear apple juices but during this process many components with high antioxidant
  potential are lost . In particular,-epicatechin and procyanidins are removed during
  the clarification process of apple juices. On the contrary in cloudy juices the
  dark products of oxidation are not removed from the juice .\n\nAfter processing,
  the apple juice is usually stored. Storage at room temperature of apple juice, for
  nine months, resulted in a 60% loss of quercetin and a total loss of procyanidins,
  despite the fact that polyphenols are more stable in fruit juices than vitamin C
  .\n\n\n\nThe massive spread of commercial apples in the last decades has resulted
  in the disappearance from the market of the local/ancient cultivars with the risk
  of losing some health related quality attributes of these fruits. In order to analyze
  and recover this germplasm, many researchers are aiming to evaluate the antioxidant
  properties and phenolic profile of these ancient varieties.\n\nIacopini and collaborators
  \ studied the phenolic content and the antioxidant properties of ancient and commercial
  varieties grown in Italy. Four ancient apple varieties and two commercial varieties
  were analyzed and their antioxidant activities were compared using peroxynitrite
  and dipheny l-2,4,6-trinitrophenyl-iminoazanium assays. Analyses were performed
  pooling peel and flesh together. Golden delicious was found to be the variety with
  the lowest content of almost all the phenolic compounds, whereas the old varieties
  Ruggine and Panaia contained the highest levels. The antioxidant activity was positively
  correlated with the total polyphenolics concentration and with the concentration
  of the principal phenolic compounds present in apple extract; catechin, epicatechin,
  and chlorogenic acid. These results suggest the relevance of ancient apple germplasm
  for providing fruit with high polyphenolic content and antioxidant scavenging properties
  . Similar data were obtained in two late-bearing apple cultivars, Diacciata and
  Limoncella, when compared with two modern commercial cultivars . In this study the
  phenolic concentration in Limoncella was particularly high confirming the importance
  of maintaining and screening these ancient germplasm as potential source of genes
  for apple breeding program by which polyphenols may be altered in apple fruit.\n\nTotal
  and individual polyphenols in apple cultivars have been shown to vary, but few data
  are available on the variability outside the specie commonly cultivated. The juice
  of over 300 non-commercial genotypes derived from 20 species of Malus, highlighting
  a 400-fold variation in total fruit polyphenol concentrations . The highest polyphenol
  concentrations were found in large-sized Malus sieversii fruit, and authors recommended
  this species as genetic parental material for future breeding program.\n\nThe availability
  of the apple genome sequence  has caused a boost of apple genetics and genomic research
  by providing new tools for identifying genes and other functional elements . In
  several plant species, pigmentation is controlled by the relative amounts of anthocyanins,
  chlorophyll, and carotenoids pigments. As these have potential positive effects
  on human health, fruit breeding has to exploit germplasm collections to develop
  new varieties with improved pigmentation, such as the breeding of red-fleshed apples
  with elevated concentrations of anthocyanins . However, this approach involves crossing
  red-fleshed wild apples relatives with modern white fleshed commercial varieties
  and requires many backcrosses to eliminate unwanted characteristics, such as poor
  taste, texture, or storage traits, from the cross derived progeny. Thanks to molecular
  biology and genomic data, alternative approaches are now exploring the direct integration
  of the dominant red-flesh MYB allele  into modern high-quality commercial apple
  cultivar via a transgenic/cisgenic approach . Using this biotechnological solution,
  Espley and collaborators  raised the polyphenolic content of Royal Gala apple by
  genetic engineering of the anthocyanin pathway using the apple transcription factor
  MYB10. The transgenic apples had very high concentrations of foliar, flower, and
  fruit anthocyanins: from 58.2 to 561.2–855.8 mg·kg−1 dry weight in the fruit peel,
  and from not detected to 565.2–208.0 mg kg−1 dry weight in the fruit cortex. Notably,
  no negative taste attributes were associated with the elevated anthocyanins indicating
  that red-fleshed apples retain consumer expectations of flavor, adding a potential
  health enhancement. In future, it may be possible to genetically modify elite apple
  genotypes for this and other specific polyphenolic traits while retaining their
  highly valuable agronomic and quality properties.\n\n\n\nOn the basis of the data
  related to apple polyphenols that we reviewed in this paper, some schematic conclusion
  could be given: \n\n\n\n"
