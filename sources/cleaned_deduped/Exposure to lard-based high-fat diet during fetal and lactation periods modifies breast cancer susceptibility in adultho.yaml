  to lard-based high-fat diet during fetal and lactation periods modifies breast cancer
  susceptibility in adultho.md
text: '


  The present study investigated whether early life exposure to high levels of animal
  fat increases breast cancer risk in adulthood in rats. Dams consumed a lard-based
  high-fat  diet  or an AIN93G control diet  during gestation or gestation and lactation.
  Their 7-week-old female offspring were exposed to 7,12-dimethyl-benzoanthracene
  to induce mammary tumors. Pregnant dams consuming an HF diet had higher circulating
  leptin levels than pregnant control dams. However, compared to the control offspring,
  significantly lower susceptibility to mammary cancer development was observed in
  the offspring of dams fed an HF diet during pregnancy, or pregnancy and lactation.
  Mammary epithelial elongation, cell proliferation  and expression of NFB p65 were
  significantly lower and p21 expression and global H3K9me3 levels were higher in
  the mammary glands of rats exposed to an HF lard diet in utero. They also tended
  to have lower Rank/Rankl ratios  and serum progesterone levels  than control offspring.
  In the mammary glands of offspring of dams consuming an HF diet during both pregnancy
  and lactation, the number of terminal end buds, epithelial elongation and the BCL-2/BAX
  ratio were significantly lower and serum leptin levels were higher than in the controls.
  Our data confirm that the breast cancer risk of offspring can be programmed by maternal
  dietary intake. However, contrary to our expectation, exposure to high levels of
  lard during early life decreased later susceptibility to breast cancer.'
