  lima bean, broad bean, common bean, pea, jack bean, goa bean, adzuki bean, hyacinth
  bean, chicking vetch, garbanzo bean, dral, cow bean, rice bean, mung bean and soybean.
  The present study was carried out with the following aims: to identify and quantify
  the individual phenolic acid and determine the total phenolic content; to assess
  their antioxidant activity, inhibition activities of α-glucosidase, tyrosinase,
  and formation of advanced glycation endproducts; and to investigate correlations
  among the phytochemicals and biological activity. Common bean possesses the highest
  antioxidant activity and advanced glycation endproducts formation inhibition activity.
  Adzuki bean has the highest α-glucosidase inhibition activity, and mung bean has
  the highest tyrosinase inhibition activity. There are significant differences in
  phytochemical content and functional activities among the bean species investigated.
  Selecting beans can help treat diseases such as dermatological hyperpigmentation
  illness, type 2 diabetes and associated cardiovascular diseases. \n\n\nlegumes;
  antioxidant; α-glucosidase inhibition; advanced glycation endproducts; tyrosinase
  inhibition \n\n\n\nLegumes as a functional food ingredient have gained a lot of
  interest . Proteins , saponins  and phenolic compounds  present in beans are active
  ingredients responsible for benefits associated with the consumption of beans. Phenolic
  compounds have been reported to reduce the risk of cancer, heart disease, and diabetes,
  as well as have antibacterial, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and anti-allergenic
  activities. Many of these benefits result from the antioxidant characteristics .
  Antioxidants refer to compounds possessing free radical-scavenging activity, transition
  metal-chelating activity, and/or singlet oxygen-quenching capacity . Several studies
  have suggested that the cells of diabetic patients are under oxidative stress with
  an imbalance between free radical-generating and radical-scavenging capacities.
  The increased free radical production and reduced antioxidant defense may partially
  mediate the initiation and progression of diabetes-associated complications .\n\nActing
  as a key enzyme for carbohydrate digestion, intestinal α-glucosidase is one of the
  glucosidases located at the epithelium of the small intestine. α-Glucosidase has
  been recognized as a therapeutic target for modulation of postprandial hyperglycaemia,
  which is the earliest metabolic abnormality to occur in type 2 diabetes mellitus
  . Inhibition of intestinal α-glucosidases delays the digestion and absorption of
  carbohydrates, thereby suppressing postprandial hyperglycaemia . Advanced glycation
  end products are part of a major pathogenic process in diabetic complications including
  neuropathy, nephropathy, retinopathy, atherosclerosis and cataracts . Thus, the
  discovery and investigation of AGE inhibitors would offer a potential therapeutic
  approach for the prevention of diabetic complications.\n\nFree radicals can up-regulate
  the mRNA level for tyrosinase, and amplify the production of melanin that correlates
  directly with serious problems in human skin . Acting as a key enzyme for synthesis
  of melanin pigments, tyrosinase catalyzes two distinct reactions in melanin synthesis:
  the hydroxylation of l-tyrosine to l-dopa and the oxidation of l-dopa to dopaquinone,
  after further series of conversions to the melanin produced . The inhibitors of
  tyrosinase have been used to treat some dermatological hyperpigmentation illness
  connected with overproduction of melanin, which also play a significant role in
  the cosmetic business as a skin whitening agent .\n\nPhenolic acids have been reported
  in some legumes, however, there is still a lack of systematic study of diverse species
  beans on the relative abundance of total phenolic content, and their antioxidant,
  α-glucosidase inhibition, advanced glycation endproducts formation inhibition, and
  tyrosinase inhibition activities.\n\n\n\n\n\nFifteen edible beans were grown in
  China in 2009. The names and places of production of the beans are shown in Table
  1. Standards of p-hydroxybenzoic acid, gentisic acid, vanillic acid, caffeic acid,
  chlorogenic acid, syringic acid, p-coumaric acid, ferulic acid, sinapic acid, m-coumaric
  acid, gallic acid, Trolox, 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical, Folin-Ciocalteu
  phenolic reagent, rat intestinal acetone powder, bovine serum albumin(BSA), d-glucose,
  methylglyoxal, l-DOPA and mushroom tyrosinase were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
  All of the chemicals were of analytical grade and were obtained from Beijing Chemical
  Reagent. All of the analytical grade solvents for high performance liquid chromatography
  were purchased from Fisher Chemicals.\n\n\n\nAll dried samples were ground in a
  laboratory mill and passed through a sieve. Bean samples were extracted twice in
  100 mL of 70% ethanol for 2 h at room temperature. After vacuum filtration, the
  supernatants were combined and concentrated under reduced pressure in a rotary evaporator
  at 50 °C. After freeze-drying, the sample powder was stored at −20 °C until analysis.
  The biological activities of the azuki beans were measured at a concentration of
  15 mg/mL.\n\n\n\nHPLC system was equipped with two Shimadzu LC-20A pumps, a Shimadzu
  LC-20 autosampler, a SPD-20A UV/vis detector and an Alltima C18 column. The wavelength
  of the UV detector was set at 280 nm. The mobile phase was a mixture of solvent
  A and solvent B. The gradient elution was programmed as follows: from 10% to 12%
  B in 16 min; from 12% to 25% B in 9 min; from 25% to 50% B in 25 min; from 50% to
  75% B in 18 min; from 75% to 10% B in 10 min. The flow rate was set at 1.0 mL/min,
  and the injection volume was 10 μL. Each phenolic acid was quantified according
  to its calibration curve.\n\n\n\nTPC was measured using the Folin-Ciocalteu method
  described previously . μBriefly, 50 L of the extract was mixed in 5 mL of distilled
  deionised water followed by the addition of 500 μL of 1 M Folin-Ciocalteu reagent
  and 500 μL of a 20% Na2CO3 solution. The mixture was thoroughly mixed and allowed
  to stand for 60 min at room temperature before the absorbance was measured at 765
  nm. Quantification was performed with respect to the standard curve of gallic acid.
  The results were expressed as milligrams of gallic acid equivalent per gram.\n\n\n\nThe
  DPPH radical-scavenging activity was determined using the method reported by Yen
  and Chen . DPPH was dissolved in 96% ethanol. The DPPH solution was mixed with 1
  mL of the extract solution. The mixture was shaken and allowed to stand at room
  temperature in the dark for 10 min. The decrease in absorbance of the resulting
  solution was measured at 517 nm after 10 min. The results were expressed in micromoles
  of Trolox equivalents per gram.\n\n\n\nThe α-glucosidase inhibition activity was
  determined as described previously . α-Glucosidase inhibition activity was assayed
  using 50 μL of extracts with varying concentrations incubated with 100 μL of 0.1
  M phosphate buffer in 96-well plates at 37 °C for 10 min. After preincubation, 50
  μL of 5 mM p-nitrophenyl-α-d-glucopyranoside in a 0.1 M phosphate buffer was added
  to each well. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 5 min. The absorbance
  readings were recorded at 490 nm on a microplate reader before and after incubation.
  The results were expressed as a percent of α-glucosidase inhibition, and the inhibition
  activity was calculated according to the following equation:/Acontrol × 100%.\n\n\n\nBSA-glucose
  and BSA-MGO models were used for the evaluation of the inhibition effect of the
  extracts on the formation of advanced glycation end products. The BSA-glucose assay
  was carried out according the method reported by Peng and others . Briefly, 5 g
  of BSA and 14.4 g of d-glucose were dissolved in 1.5 M phosphate buffer to obtain
  the control solution with 50 mg/mL BSA and 0.8 M d-glucose. Two milliliters of the
  control solution was incubated at 37 °C for 7 days in the presence or absence of
  1 mL of bean extracts in a 1.5 M phosphate buffer. After 7 days of incubation, fluorescent
  intensity was measured. Percent inhibition of AGE formation by each extract was
  calculated using the following equation:) × 100%.\n\nThe BSA-MGO assay was carried
  out according to the method reported by Yao and others . Briefly, 40 mg of BSA was
  mixed with 31 μL of MGO in a 0.1 M phosphate buffer to obtain the control solution
  with 1 mg/mL BSA and 5 mM MGO. Two milliliters of the control solution was incubated
  at 37 °C for 6 days with or without 1 mL of the bean extracts in phosphate buffer.
  The percent inhibition was calculated based on the equation applied in the BSA-glucose
  assay as described above.\n\n\n\nThe tyrosinase activity was determined as described
  previously . Assays were conducted in a 96-well microtiter plate and a plate reader
  was used to measure absorbance at 475 nm. Each well contained 40 μL of sample with
  80 μL of phosphate buffer, 40 μL of tyrosinase and 40 μL of l-DOPA, the samples
  were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Control had all the components except tyrosinase.
  The percentage tyrosinase inhibition was calculated as follows:/Acontrol × 100%\n\n\n\nAll
  values were expressed as mean ± SD. Data were analyzed using one-way analysis of
  variance followed by Tukey-Kramer test.\n\n\n\n\n\nFive phenolic acids were found
  in those beans, the contents of individual phenolic acid in the different bean samples
  are shown in Table 2. It was found that ferulic acid was the dominant phenolic acid
  in all beans, the highest content was 26.06 ± 2.19 mg/100 g in common bean and the
  lowest one was 9.10 ± 1.29 mg/100 g in garbanzo bean. The highest p-coumaric acid
  was found in common bean, 10.3 times higher than that in goa bean, which was the
  lowest among all the bean samples investigated in this study.\n\nIt was also found
  that TPC as measured by Folin-Ciocalteu method varied widely in legumes. Phenolic
  compounds are considered as the major compounds that contribute to the total antioxidant
  activities of the grains . In the present study, common bean, with an average of
  8.59 ± 0.11 mg GAE/g, was found to possess the highest TPC among all of the studied
  legumes and had 8.3 times greater than that of garbanzo bean. Mung bean had a high
  level of phenolics, this observation is in agreement with that of Peng et al ; they
  found that mung bean extract had the highest TPC among mung bean, black bean, soybean
  and cow bean.\n\nThe antioxidant activities of legume extracts were evaluated by
  measuring their DPPH radical scavenging activities. All of the extracts exhibited
  strong antioxidant activities, DPPH showed the same trends as did in TPC. Among
  the tested samples, common bean had the highest DPPH free radical scavenging activity,
  whereas garbanzo bean had the lowest DPPH free radical scavenging activity. Our
  results on DPPH in soybean were in agreement with that reported previously , the
  results from garbanzo bean were in agreement with that of the previous report ,
  while the other results from pea, and common bean in a previous report based on
  dry weight . Differences between our results and previous reports may be attributed
  partly to the differences in the sources of materials and in expressions based on
  dry weight or fresh basis calculation. It is difficult to compare our data to that
  reported by Amarowicz and Ronaldsince  as they were expressed in a different unit.\n\nIt
  was found that TPC were highly correlated with their antioxidant activity. Similar
  effect was found in the study by Yao et al.  who investigated seven color grains
  and found the antioxidant activity showed a positive correlation with their TPC.
  Antioxidant activity of phenolics depends on the structure and substitution pattern
  of hydroxyl groups. p-Coumaric can exhibit competitive antioxidant activity because
  of the 4-position of hydroxylation on the phenolic ring and the additional conjugation
  in the propenoic side chain, which might facilitate the electron delocalization,
  by resonance, between the aromatic ring and propenoic group gives high antioxidant
  activity .\n\n\n\nTable 3 shows that adzuki bean had the highest α-glucosidase inhibition
  activity, followed by the Goa bean. Itoh et al.  investigated the antidiabetic effects
  of azuki beans on streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats, and they suggested that
  the active fraction of azuki beans suppresses the postprandial blood glucose by
  inhibiting α-glucosidase. The inhibition in common bean, cow bean and rice bean
  was higher than 50%. α-Glucosidase inhibition was not statistically correlated with
  their phenolic acids and antioxidant activities of the extracts. Mccue and others
  \ investigated fifteen Asian beans, fruits and vegetables, and they concluded that
  a high phenolic content does not always confer a high inhibition of α-glucosidase
  activity of a food extract, which may be due to the nonphenolic compounds in the
  samples.\n\n\n\nThe inhibition measured by BSA-glucose varied significantly among
  different beans. Common bean had the highest inhibition, followed by mung bean.
  The inhibition measured by BSA-MGO showed the same trends as did BSA-glucose method.
  Common bean exhibited the highest inhibition, followed by mung bean. Beans have
  been recommended as suitable foods for diabetic patients in the past mainly based
  on their high fiber and protein contents . Recently, it has been reported that beans
  contained considerable bioactive phytochemicals, including phenolic compounds, which
  offer extra benefits for amelioration of diabetes and alleviating diabetic complications
  . The results obtained in our study showed that BSA-MGO and BSA-gluocose significantly
  correlate with TPC assay. Similar results have been observed by Peng and others
  \ who investigated the correlation of the total phenolic content and inhibition
  effect of the phenolics on the formation of advanced glycation end products of mung
  bean, black bean, soybean and cowpea, and they demonstrated that phenolic compounds
  inhibit the formation of advanced glycation end products by inhibition of free radical
  generation in the glycation process and subsequent inhibition of protein modifications.\n\n\n\nIn
  present study, mung bean with an average inhibition of 81.24%, had the highest tyrosinase
  inhibition activities among all the legumes and was 3.5 times higher than that of
  garbanzo bean. Common bean also had a high level of inhibition. To our knowledge,
  this is the first report that edible beans have tyrosinase inhibition activities.
  The results showed that tyrosinase inhibition activity significantly correlates
  with TPC and DPPH assays. Gomez-Cordoves and others  reported phenolic fractions
  inhibit melanogenic activity in melanocytes and decrease colony forming of melanoma
  cells, which support their potential as therapeutic agents in the treatments of
  human melanoma. Melanogenesis is activated by oxidation related processes such as
  UV radiation. Melanogenesis requires tyrosinase activity and reactive species such
  as reactive oxygen and nitrogen species cause oxidative stress to the skin resulting
  in skin pigmentation and ageing . Hence, controlling oxidative stress is important
  for the regulation of melanogenesis, since the antioxidant may be closely related
  to anti-melanogenic actions and regulation of melanin synthesis . This was recently
  confirmed by Abdillahi  and Wu , where the anti-melanogenic activity of both Podocarpus
  and Taiwanese were attributed to their antioxidative actions.\n\n\n\nIn summary,
  there are significant differences in phytochemical content and functional activities
  among the bean species investigated. Common bean appeared to possess the highest
  antioxidant activity, adzuki bean has the highest α-glucosidase inhibition and advanced
  glycation endproducts formation, and mung bean has the highest tyrosinase inhibition
  activity among all the beans tested. These results provide useful information when
  selecting bean species for better design of potential functional food that can treat
  diseases such as dermatological hyperpigmentation illness, type 2 diabetes and associated
  cardiovascular diseases.\n\n\n\nThe present study was supported by the Institute
  Fund from The Ministry of Sciences and Technology, China and the earmarked fund
  for Modern Agro-industry Technology Research System.\n"
