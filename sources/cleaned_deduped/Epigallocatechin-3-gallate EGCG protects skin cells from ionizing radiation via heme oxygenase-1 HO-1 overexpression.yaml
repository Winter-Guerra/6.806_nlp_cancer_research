  Epigallocatechin-3-gallate, the major polyphenolic constituent of green tea, is
  a potent antioxidant and free radical scavenger that may have therapeutic applications
  for the treatment of many disorders. Radiation therapy is widely used for the treatment
  of various types of cancers; however, radiation-induced skin injury remains a serious
  concern. EGCG has not yet been reported as protecting skin cells against ionizing
  radiation. In the present study, we investigated whether EGCG confers cytoprotection
  against ionizing radiation. We found that, compared with the control, pretreatment
  with EGCG significantly enhanced the viability of human skin cells that were irradiated
  with X-rays, and decreased apoptosis induced by X-ray irradiation. Mito-Tracker
  assay showed that EGCG suppressed the damage to mitochondria induced by ionizing
  radiation via upregulation of SOD2. Reactive oxygen species in HaCaT cells were
  significantly reduced when pretreated with EGCG before irradiation. Radiation-induced
  Î³H2AX foci, which are representative of DNA double-strand breaks, were decreased
  by pretreatment with EGCG. Furthermore, EGCG induced the expression of the cytoprotective
  molecule heme oxygenase-1 in a dose-dependent manner via transcriptional activation.
  HO-1 knockdown or treatment with the HO-1 inhibitor tin protoporphyrin reversed
  the protective role of EGCG, indicating an important role for HO-1. These results
  suggest that EGCG offers a new strategy for protecting skin against ionizing radiation. '
