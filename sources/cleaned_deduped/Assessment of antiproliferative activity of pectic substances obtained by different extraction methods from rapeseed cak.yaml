  In this work the antiproliferative activity of pectic substances obtained by different
  extraction methods from defatted rapeseed cake was assessed on cancer cell lines.
  The process consisted of sequential treatment with alkalized water, EDTA, alkaline
  protease  and a commercial pectinase preparation. Pectic extracts identification
  was performed using spectroscopy and chromatography techniques. FT-IR and HPLC-IR
  results suggest that the neutral pectic extracts produced would be arabinogalactans
  and -galactans. All the pectic substances extracted  from RSC exhibited antiproliferative
  activity, being more effective on MCF-7 cells than Caco-2. The most effective pectic
  extract was obtained by Alkalase 2.4 L which killed over 80% of MCF-7 cells and
  60% of Caco-2 cells. At less than 10 mg/mL pectic extracts enriched in neutral sugars
  also exhibited antiproliferative activity, which was superior to the modified citric
  pectins activity at the same concentration for the breast cancer cell line. These
  results show that the antiproliferative activity depends on both the type of pectin  and
  the extraction procedure.'
