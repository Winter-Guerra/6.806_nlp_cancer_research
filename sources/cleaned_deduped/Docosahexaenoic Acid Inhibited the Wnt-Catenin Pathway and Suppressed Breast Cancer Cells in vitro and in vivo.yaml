  N-3 fatty acids  are essential FAs necessary for human health and are known to possess
  anticancer properties. However, the relationship between n-3 FAs and -catenin, one
  of the key components of the Wnt signaling pathway, in mouse breast cancer remains
  poorly characterized. In this study, 4T1 mouse breast cancer cells were exposed
  to a representative n-3 FA, docosahexaenoic acid, to investigate the relationship
  between n-3 FAs and the Wnt/-catenin signaling pathway in vivo and in vitro. In
  vitro studies showed that DHA strongly inhibited cell growth, and induced G1 cell
  cycle arrest both in 4T1 mouse breast cells and MCF-7 human breast cells. DHA reduced
  -catenin expression and T cell factor/lymphoid-enhancing factor reporter activity
  in 4T1 mouse breast cells. In addition, DHA down-regulated the expression of downstream
  target genes such as c-myc and cyclinD1. In vivo, therapy experiments were conducted
  on Babl/c mice bearing breast cancer. We found that feeding mouse the 5% fish oil-supplemented
  diet for 30 days significantly reduced the growth of 4T1 mouse breast cancer in
  vivo through inhibition of cancer cell proliferation as well as induction of apoptosis.
  Feeding animals a 5% fish oil diet significantly induced down-regulation of -catenin
  in tumor tissues with a notable increase in apoptosis. In addition, fish oil-supplemented
  diet decreased lung metastases of breast cancer. These observations suggested that
  DHA exerted its anticancer activity through down-regulation of Wnt/-catenin signaling.
  Thus, our data call for further studies to assess the effectiveness of fish oil
  as a dietary supplement in the prevention and treatment of breast cancer.'
