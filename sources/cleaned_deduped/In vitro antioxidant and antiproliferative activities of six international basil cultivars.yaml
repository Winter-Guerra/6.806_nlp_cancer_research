  The total phenolic, flavonoid and tannin contents in leaves extracts of Ocimum basilicum
  international cultivars, as well as their overall antioxidant activities using DPPH
  and linoleic acid assays, were investigated. Furthermore, the antiproliferative
  and cytotoxic activities against line HeLa, MCF-7, Jurkat, HT-29, T24, MIAPaCa-2
  cancer cells and one normal human cell line HEK-293 were examined. DPPH and linoleic
  acid assays ranged from 75.8% to 93.3% and from 74.5% to 97.1%; respectively. O.
  b. ‘purple ruffle’, O. b. ‘dark opale’, O. b. ‘genovese’, O. b. ‘anise’, O. b. ‘bush
  green’ and O. b. L. varied in their antiproliferative and cytotoxic activities,
  influenced cell cycle progression and stimulated apoptosis in most cancer cells.
  OBL exhibited the highest antioxidant and antiproliferative activities. OB extracts
  not only improve taste but also have certain anticancer activity against diverse
  cancer cells due to the presence of compounds such as rosmarinic acid, chicoric
  acid and caftaric acid. Thus, OB represents a potent source of anticancer materials.'
