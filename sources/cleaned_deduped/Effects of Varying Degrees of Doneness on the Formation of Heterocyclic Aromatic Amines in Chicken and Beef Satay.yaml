text: '


  The study was carried out to determine the effect of cooking method on Heterocyclic
  Aromatic Amines  concentration in grilled chicken and beef. Six common HAs were
  investigated: 2-amino-3-methylimidazoquinolone, 2amino 3,4dimethylimidazo quinoline,
  2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazoquinoxaline, 2-amino-3,4,8 trimethylimidazoquinoxaline,
  2-amino-3,7,8trimethylimidazo quinoxaline, and 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazopyridine.
  Chicken and beef satay samples were grilled to medium and well done level of doneness.
  Charcoal grilled, microwave pre-treatment prior to grilling, and microwave-deep
  fried  were applied to beef and chicken satay samples. The satay samples which were
  microwaved prior to grilling  showed significantly  lower HAs concentration as compared
  to those charcoal grilled. Both medium and well done cooked beef and chicken satay
  samples that were microwaved and deep fried  as an alternative method to grilling
  were proven to produce significantly lesser HAs as compared to charcoal-grilled  and
  microwaved prior to grilling.'
