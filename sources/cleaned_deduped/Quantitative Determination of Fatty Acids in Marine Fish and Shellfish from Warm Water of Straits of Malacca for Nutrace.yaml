  Determination of Fatty Acids in Marine Fish and Shellfish from Warm Water of Straits
  of Malacca for Nutrace.md
text: '


  This study was conducted to quantitatively determine the fatty acid contents of
  20 species of marine fish and four species of shellfish from Straits of Malacca.
  Most samples contained fairly high amounts of polyunsaturated fatty acids, especially
  alpha-linolenic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, and docosahexaenoic acid. Longtail
  shad, yellowstripe scad, and moonfish contained significantly higher  amounts of
  eicosapentaenoic acid, docosahexaenoic acid, and alpha-linolenic acid, respectively.
  Meanwhile, fringescale sardinella, malabar red snapper, black pomfret, Japanese
  threadfin bream, giant seaperch, and sixbar grouper showed considerably high content  of
  desirable omega-3 fatty acids. The polyunsaturated-fatty-acids/saturated-fatty-acids  ratios
  for most samples were higher than that of Menhaden oil, a recommended PUFA supplement
  which may help to lower blood pressure. Yellowstripe scad, moonfish, and longtail
  shad  were the samples with an outstandingly desirable overall composition of fatty
  acids. Overall, the marine fish and shellfish from the area contained good composition
  of fatty acids which offer health benefits and may be used for nutraceutical purposes
  in the future.


  Fish and shellfish are widely accepted as highly nutritious and healthy foods. However,
  people usually think that different types of fish are of similar nutritional value,
  and fish selections are made only based on availability, freshness, flavor, and
  other physical factors. Based on the Malaysian Adult Nutrition Survey, the prevalence
  of daily consumption of marine fish among rural and urban adults were quite high
  at 51% and 34%, respectively. Therefore, it is crucial to increase the awareness
  of different nutrient contents of fish and shellfish species by providing complete
  nutritional value information, especially for fatty acid content, which is associated
  with various health-related effects.


  Nutritional analysis of fatty acids can be classified as qualitative and quantitative.
  Qualitative analysis of fatty acid produces data regarding the fatty acid composition
  in the form of percentages of total fatty acids. Meanwhile, quantitative analysis
  is able to quantify the actual amount  of each fatty acid that is present in the
  food. Quantitative data are often presented in the form of weight of the fatty acid
  per weight of food or fat. Currently, there are limited qualitative fatty acid data
  on marine fish and shellfish from warm water area; meanwhile, no quantitative data
  are available especially as a mean to utilize source of natural product for nutraceutical
  purposes.


  Reliable analytical data are prerequisite for correct interpretation of findings
  in nutritional content analysis, since unreliable results may lead to over- or underestimations,
  false interpretations, and unwarranted conclusions. Thus, validation procedures
  of analytical methods were also performed to provide reliable quantitative data
  on the fatty acid contents of various species of local marine fish and shellfish.


  All chemicals and reagents used for analysis were of analytical and gas chromatography  grade.
  Menhaden oil, 37 components FAME mix 47885-U, and tridecanoic acid  were used as
  standards in the fatty acid content analysis.


  A stratified random sampling procedure was used as it was the most suitable method
  in database work. To ensure representativeness, ten fish landing areas along the
  Straits of Malacca were identified with the help of Malaysian Fisheries Development
  Authority. The locations are marked as L1 through L10, respectively.


  At each of the collection sites, available samples were collected randomly according
  to species. All samples were from free-roaming fish and shellfish; and they were
  collected fresh. All samples were immediately placed on ice, kept cold, and transported
  in polystyrene boxes to maintain freshness. Upon arrival at Universiti Putra Malaysia,
  the temperature of ice boxes was checked to ensure samples were still within the
  range of 4C to 0C. Then, samples for nutrient determination were individually measured
  for total body weight and length. Only samples of a weight within the narrow range
  for each species were included as primary samples. Then, the samples were beheaded,
  gutted, washed, and filleted. These primary samples were placed in sealed plastic
  bags and frozen at 20C. The actual degree of freshness of samples during transportation
  and time of analysis may not be assured as there was no analysis of freshness or
  quality index of samples was done. However, appropriate precautions were performed
  to sustain freshness of samples and minimize oxidation throughout the study by performing
  procedures in chillers room  and under minimal light exposures.


  A small-scale experiment performed independently showed insignificant differences
  in nutrient contents of samples from different locations. This observation justified
  that units of primary samples can be combined or composited by geographical locations
  to minimize the number of analytical measurements and yet represent the contribution
  of the unit to the estimate of central tendency. Thus, before analysis, three composite
  samples were prepared by mixing individual samples  of the same weight for each
  species. Individual samples from L1, L2, L3, and L4 constituted as Composite 1;
  individual samples from L5, L6, and L7 constituted as Composite 2; while individual
  samples from L8, L9, and L10 constituted as Composite 3. All composite samples were
  analyzed separately and data presented are the mean values of each of the species.


  Extraction of fat was done following Bligh and Dyer, with slight modifications by
  Kinsella et al.. Representative samples of fish filets  were homogenized in a Waring
  blender for 2 min with a mixture of methanol  and chloroform. One volume of chloroform  was
  added to the mixture and after blending for additional 30 seconds, distilled water  was
  added. The homogenate was stirred with a glass rod and filtered through Whatman
  No. 1 filter paper on a Buchner funnel with slight suction. The filtrate was transferred
  to a separatory funnel. The lower clear phase was drained into a 250 mL round-bottom
  flask and concentrated with a rotary evaporator at 40C. To minimize oxidation, the
  extracted lipids were kept in solvents containing 0.05% butylated hydroxytoluene,
  in glass bottles, flushed with nitrogen, and wrapped with aluminium foils to avoid
  any light exposure. Then, the bottles were stored immediately at 20C and only being
  taken out from freezer just before analysis.


  Lipid samples were converted to their constituent FAMEs following the method used
  in previous study. Approximately 25 mg  of oil was weighed and added with 1.5 mL
  of NaOH 0.50 M in methanol in a 15 mL capped centrifuge tube. The mixture was heated
  in a water bath at 100C for 5 min and then cooled at room temperature. The mixture
  was added with 2.0 mL of boron trifluoride  in methanol and heated again in a water
  bath at 100C for 30 minutes. Next, the tube was cooled in running water at room
  temperature before adding 1 mL of isooctane. It was vigorously stirred for 30 seconds
  before adding 5.0 mL of a saturated sodium chloride solution to facilitate the phase
  separation. The esterified sample was placed in a refrigerator and left to rest
  for better phase separation. After collecting the supernatant, another 1.0 mL of
  isooctane  was added into the tube and stirred. The supernatant was collected and
  added to the previous fraction. The sample was concentrated to a final volume of
  1.0 mL for later injection into the gas chromatograph. As precautions, amber vials
  were used in order to minimize oxidation during analysis.


  Analysis of Gas Chromatography. Analysis of methyl esters was performed by a capillary
  gas chromatograph model Agilent 6890  equipped with a split-splitless injector,
  flame ionization detection  system used to separate and quantify each FAME component.
  FAMEs were separated using a highly polar HP88 column  column. Carrier gas was helium
  at a linear velocity of 30.0 mL/min. Split injection with a split ratio  of 10 :
  1 and 99.9 mL/min split flow was used. The operating conditions were 250C injection
  port, 250C flame ionization detector, and 200C column temperature. Compounds were
  identified by comparison of the retention times of 37 components FAME mix 47885-U  and
  Menhaden oil standards.


  Quantification of Fatty Acids. The concentration of fatty acids in mg/g of total
  lipids was measured against tridecanoic acid methyl ester  as an internal standard.
  This followed procedures described in a previous study  with slight modifications;
  in which the Empirical Response Factor  of FID  was calculated and used instead
  of theoretical response factor. Calculation of the empirical response factor  was
  done as described in the literature. The following formulae were used in the quantification
  of fatty acids: where Psi: peak area of individual fatty acids in mixed FAME standard
  solution, PsIS: peak area of fatty acid internal standard in mixed FAME standard
  solution, WISm: weight of fatty acid internal standard in mixed FAME standard solution,
  and Wi: weight of individual FAME in mixed FAME standard solution; where AX: peak
  area of fatty acid, AIS: peak area of internal standard  WIS: weight  of IS added
  to the sample, WX: sample weight, Ri: empirical response factor, and 1.04: conversion
  factor necessary to express results in mg fatty acid/g oil.


  Linearity Test. Three fatty acid standards, myristic acid, heptadecanoic acid, and
  linoleic acid were prepared at different concentrations: myristic acid, heptadecanoicacid,
  linoleic acid. These fatty acid standards were used as they represent both saturated
  and unsaturated fatty acids present in samples. Calibration curves were formed for
  each of the compounds. The linearity parameters, which included linear regression  and
  the correlation coefficient  were obtained from the linear relationship between
  the peak area and the concentrations of the fatty acid standards.


  Precision Test. Two precision tests of repeatability  and reproducibility  were
  performed. Two fatty acid standards were quantified in three randomly selected samples
  in both tests. For repeatability, four replicates of each sample were analyzed in
  a single day using the same procedures as in the fatty acid analysis. Data are reported
  as relative standard deviations  of four replicates, with minimum and maximum values
  of both palmitic and linolenic acids quantified in each sample. For reproducibility,
  samples were analyzed using the same procedures as in the fatty acid analysis on
  three different days, representing three replicates of each sample. Palmitic acid
  and linolenic acids were quantified and presented as relative standard deviations  of
  three replicates, with minimum and maximum values of each fatty acid.


  Recovery Test. The recovery of the method was determined using three different concentrations  of
  myristic acid, heptadecanoic acid, and stearic acid standards. Two samples were
  randomly selected and used for the recovery analysis of each of the fatty acid standards.
  During the sample preparation, each standard was added together with lipid extract
  and internal standards and prepared following the same procedures used in normal
  sample preparation. Recoveries of different standards were performed separately
  to avoid overlapping of peaks in chromatograms which could lead to biased results.
  Recoveries of fatty acid standards at different concentrations were determined by
  comparing the content of the fatty acids in samples with and without the addition
  of the standard. Data are presented as the percentage of recovery.


  Statistical Analysis. Data were analyzed using SPSS  version 17.0. The mean, standard
  deviation, and one-way ANOVA test followed by Tukey post-hoc analysis were performed
  to compare differences in the mean fatty acid contents of different species of fish
  and shellfish. Bivariate correlation  was performed to explore the relationships
  between different fatty acid classes in samples.


  Data from this study are reported in the form of milligrams per 100 grams of wet
  muscle. Tables 2, 3, and 4 show the sample content of saturated, monounsaturated,
  and polyunsaturated fatty acids, respectively.


  Based on the previous findings, the studied fish samples can be categorized into
  lean-, low-, medium-, and high-fat fish based on the fat content. Among the lean-fish,
  hardtail scad was high in saturated fatty acids, with palmitic acid as the highest.
  The monounsaturated fatty acid  of the fish was 121.2 mg/100 g wet sample; with
  fairly high oleic acid  and heptadecenoic acid, at 63.9 and 45.7 mg/100 g wet sample,
  respectively. For PUFA, hardtail scad contained quite high amounts of DHA, at 196.0
  mg/100 g wet sample, followed by ALA  at 117.3 mg/100 g wet sample. Meanwhile, malabar
  red snapper was higher in PUFA, characterized by high DHA  at 209.9 mg/100 g wet
  sample, followed by ALA  at 335.0 mg/100 g wet sample. For SFA, palmitic acid was
  the dominant fatty acid, followed by caprylic acid at 112.8 mg/100 g wet sample.
  The MUFA content was 141.8 mg/100 g wet sample, with fairly high oleic acid  at
  119.5 mg/100 g wet sample.


  Among the low-fat fish, yellowstripe scad contained a very high PUFA content, with
  significantly higher  levels of DHA  compared to other samples. The DHA amount was
  about 2.7 times higher than Japanese threadfin bream ; and about 86.6 times higher
  than long-tailed butterfly ray. Additionally, yellowstripe scad also had a high
  ALA  level at 338.1 mg/100 g wet sample. For SFA and MUFA, the most dominant fatty
  acids were palmitic acid  and oleic acid, respectively.


  The medium-fat fish, moonfish, showed palmitic acid as the most prominent fatty
  acid. This was followed by -linolenic acid  at 1046.8 mg/100 g wet sample, which
  was significantly higher  compared to the others. Other  fatty acids, such as eicosatrienoic
  acid, EPA, and DHA  were at 257.6, 176.7, and 122.6 mg/100 g wet sample, respectively.
  Its  fatty acid content, linolelaidic acid  and linoleic acid, were the second highest
  after level in longtail shad, respectively. Meanwhile, for MUFA, the most dominant
  fatty acid was oleic acid, at 398.5 mg/100 g wet sample. Moonfish also contained
  significantly higher  of heptadecenoic acid  compared to others.


  The high-fat fish, longtail shad also showed palmitic acid  as the dominant fatty
  acid. For MUFA, longtail shad contained significantly higher  of palmitoleic acid  and
  oleic acid  compared to others. While for PUFA, the fish contained significantly
  higher  of EPA  and eicosatrienoicacid  compared to others. Besides, longtail shad
  was also high in  fatty acids; with linolelaidic acid  at 2254.1 mg/100 g wet muscle,
  and linoleic acid  at 1327.4 mg/100 g wet muscle.


  As in most of fish samples, shellfish including cuttlefish, cockles, and oyster
  also showed palmitic acid  as the most prominent fatty acid. Meanwhile, prawn showed
  caprylic acid  as the highest fatty acid, followed by palmitic acid  at 125.3 mg/100
  g wet sample. For MUFA, cockles contained higher oleic acid  compared to other shellfish.
  While for PUFA, cockles were found to be higher in both EPA  and DHA, compared to
  other shellfish. However, the content of alpha-linolenic acid  in cockles  was the
  lowest among all samples; with cuttlefish, prawn, and oysterr.


  Most of previous local studies have focused on qualitative aspects of fat content
  in various samples of marine and freshwater origin samples. A previous study found
  very high percentage of PUFA; with omega-3 PUFA, other PUFA, and omega-6 PUFA  in
  ten common fish species with the current study. Meanwhile, percentages of SFA and
  MUFA were quite low; at 3.6311.4% and 1.379.12%, respectively. This study found
  hexadecadienoic acid as the most prominent fatty acid  in six samples, hexadecatrienoic
  acid  in two samples, and hexadecadienoic acid  in other two samples. Another local
  study reported PUFA as the dominant group of fatty acid in seven species, and SFA
  as the dominant fatty acid group in another six species of their fish samples. Palmitic
  acid  was the most prominent fatty acid  in eight samples; meanwhile, DHA  was the
  highest fatty acid  in another five samples. Same findings were reported by other
  study of 16 species of local pelagic fish; with palmitic acid  as the most prominent
  fatty acid  in nine species, meanwhile, DHA  was the highest fatty acid  in another
  seven species. The current study, however, focuses on the quantitative aspect of
  samples fat thus allow limited comparison be made with these previous local data.
  However, there were a few studies focused on the quantitative aspects of fatty acids
  in other cold water species of marine and freshwater fish and shellfish performed
  in other countries. The comparisons made with the previous findings would be useful
  in giving better overview of the content of fatty acids in local marine fish and
  shellfish.


  One of the previous quantitative studies of fatty acids had reported the  and  fatty
  acids content in different types  of salmon from North America and Europe. Linoleic
  acid  were at 67, 647, 604, and 1719 mg/100 g muscles for wild salmon, farmed salmon,
  supermarket salmon, and salmon feed ; which were higher than most of the samples  in
  current study. However, longtail shad is comparable in linoleic acid content with
  salmon feed, at 1327.4 mg/100 g wet sample. This previous study also reported low
  -linolenic acid  at 3 mg/100 g, 14 mg/100 g, 13 mg/100 g, and 40 mg/100 g. Only
  three samples in current study were found to contain this fatty acid; hard tail
  scad, silver pomfret, and black pomfret, which were comparable with their findings.
  For -linolenic acid, most samples in current study contained about 100300 mg/100
  g of this fatty acid; which were higher than wild salmon, comparable with farmed
  salmon  and supermarket salmon, meanwhile were lower when compared to salmon feed.


  Most samples in current study contained lower EPA  compared to wild salmon, farmed
  salmon, supermarket salmon, and salmon feed. Only longtail shad was found to contain
  comparable amount of EPA with salmon feed; at 2638 mg/100 g wet sample. It is really
  interesting to find such a high level of EPA in longtail shad, as high intake of
  this fatty acid had been related with protective effects to the occurrence of asthma,
  coronary heart problems and many other diseases. Meanwhile, compared to DHA values  reported
  by the previous study, the content of this fatty acid in most samples of the current
  study were lower. However, yellowstripe scad  was found to contain slightly higher
  DHA content compared to wild salmon.


  Data from National Nutrient Data by United States Department of Agriculture  showed
  Greenland halibut, farmed catfish, wild catfish, farmed salmon, and wild salmon
  contained  at 1177.6, 177.6, 236.5, 2147.1, and 1840 mg/100 g muscles. Generally,
  most samples in the current study contained  amounts ; which were lower compared
  to Greenland halibut, farmed salmon, and wild salmon; but comparable with farmed
  and wild catfish. However, longtail shad  was found to contain  at comparable amount
  with farmed and wild salmon. This could be due to the high fat content of the fish.


  The current study is novel as it provides new quantitative findings for warm water
  species of fish and shellfish. Moreover, the findings are of necessary representativeness,
  which resulted from systematic sampling procedures performed. Data from the current
  study is also highly important as it represents samples from the Straits of Malacca,
  which aligns the west coast of Peninsular Malaysia, the main contributor of marine
  landings production in the country which produced 50.16% of the total marine landings
  production of Malaysia and 67.34% of the marine landings production of peninsular
  areas.


  Overall, seventeen species of samples contained SFA as the dominant group of fatty
  acid, with palmitic acid  as the highest fatty acid quantified in most of samples.
  The high amount of palmitic acid is due to its function as a key metabolite in fish,
  and the level is not influenced by the diet. Meanwhile, seven of the samples  contained
  PUFA as the dominant group of fatty acid. Generally, the PUFA to SFA  ratios of
  most of the samples of this study  were above the value for Menhaden oil ; as suggested
  by Food and Drug Association  as PUFA supplement. Besides, ratios exceeding 0.50
  have also been shown to lower blood cholesterol level.


  Among the lean fish, hardtail scad and Indian mackerel contained fairly high SFA
  but fairly low PUFA; which resulted in low P/S ratio of 0.6 and 0.3, respectively.
  Meanwhile, other lean fish showed higher P/S ratios, between 0.6 and 1.4. For low-fat
  fish, four-finger threadfin showed low P/S ratio of 0.5. Other low-fat fish showed
  P/S ratio between 0.6 and 1.7. While for the medium fat fish, moonfish contained
  quite high P/S ratio of 1.0. The high-fat fish, longtail shad contained higher SFA
  content compared to PUFA that resulted in low P/S ratio of 0.4. Overall, most of
  samples contained favorable ratio of fatty acids, which was beneficial for PUFA
  intake and lowering blood cholesterol.


  There is no specific trend in levels of saturation or unsaturation relative to the
  fat content of samples. On the other hand, a very high positive correlation was
  found between fat content of samples with all three classes of fatty acids; SFA,
  MUFA, and PUFA. This suggested that increment in fat content is followed by increment
  in the content of all forms of fatty acids: SFA, MUFA, and PUFA in the samples.


  The 3 :  ratio has been suggested as a useful indicator for comparing relative nutritional
  values of fish oils. The ratio is also expressed in the form of /. It has been suggested
  that an 3 :  ratio of 1 : 1 to 1 : 5  would constitute a healthy human diet. High  :  ratio
  is preferred, as excess  fatty acids can counteract the health benefits of  fatty
  acid intake.


  Overall, long-tailed butterfly ray and cuttlefish had very high ratios of /, at
  13.3 and 15.3, respectively. However, the high ratio was not contributed to by high  fatty
  acids, but by the low content of  fatty acids. These fish contained 349.3 and 472.9
  mg/100 g wet samples of  fatty acids, respectively, which were within the common
  range of other samples. Meanwhile, their  fatty acids contents were only 26.3 mg/100
  g wet sample for long-tailed butterfly ray, and 30.9 mg/100 g wet sample for cuttlefish.
  The same reason applied to the fairly high ratio of / at 9.8, 8.7, 7.8, and 7.3
  for another four samples; namely, Indian threadfin, prawn, large-scale tongue sole,
  and Spanish mackerel. These samples contained  fatty acids between 235.9 and 414.3
  mg/100 g wet samples; meanwhile their  fatty acids were below than 40 mg/100 g wet
  sample. While for yellowstripe scad, the high ratio of / was contributed by its
  high content of  fatty acids  compared to  fatty acids. In contrast, longtail shad
  contained high content of  fatty, resulted in fairly low ratio of 3 :, which was
  the lowest among all samples.


  A few validation analyses were performed to ensure the reliability of the method
  used for fatty acid analysis in this study; these measures included linearity, precision,
  and recovery tests. Linear relationships were observed for myristic acid  standard,
  heptadecanoic acid  standard, and linoleic acid  standard.


  The precision test assessed both repeatability  and reproducibility  tests. Table
  6 shows the RSD values for the repeatability test of fatty acids; these values ranged
  between 1.43.6% for palmitic acid and 0.21.9% for linolenic acid. Meanwhile, Table
  7 shows the RSD values for the reproducibility test, which ranged between 0.92.4%
  for palmitic acid, and 0.161.86% for linolenic acid. The RSD values in this study
  were lower compared to most RSD values  as reported previously, but were higher
  when compared with excellent RSD values  reported by another study. However, from
  overall, the RSD values in all repeatability and reproducibility tests were satisfactory
  and showed that the methods used were reliable to produce precise data for multiple
  determinations of fatty acids  in fish and shellfish samples, both in a single-day
  and multiple-day determinations.


  Meanwhile, the percentages of recoveries for different concentrations of myristic
  acid were between 90.3105.6% in golden snapper and 106.8119.4% in cockles. Meanwhile
  for heptadecanoic acid, the percentages of recoveries were between 87.1111.9% in
  golden snapper and 112.8115.9% in cockles. For stearic acid, the range of 93.4108.8%
  in cockles. Overall, the recovery percentages were satisfactory, at about 90120%,
  which is comparable to the values  reported by previous studies. This shows that
  the methods used in the analysis are highly accurate for determinations of fatty
  acid contents at various concentrations in fish and shellfish samples.


  Overall, most of the marine fish and shellfish samples contained desirable compositions
  of fatty acids with a fairly high amount of  fatty acids, a suitable ratio of /
  fatty acids, and preferable P/S ratios which were higher than the level in the recommended
  PUFA supplement, Menhaden oil. Three samples were identified as being outstanding
  in their desirable overall composition of fatty acids: yellowstripe scad, moonfish,
  and longtail shad. These findings showed that marine fish and shellfish from warm
  water area contain a good composition of fatty acids and could provide many health
  benefits if consumed regularly. These reliable and representative data are very
  useful to develop a nutritional database of marine fish and shellfish from warm
  water area and as reference to people for intake locally and globally. Additionally,
  the findings also showed that some identified species of fish and shellfish from
  this area may have possible value in terms of future manipulation for various nutraceutical
  purposes. However, further studies should be developed on this matter.
