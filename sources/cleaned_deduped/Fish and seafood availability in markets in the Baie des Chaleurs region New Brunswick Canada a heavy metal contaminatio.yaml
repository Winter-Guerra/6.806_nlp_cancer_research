text: "\n\nThe consumption of halieutic products has many health benefits. However,
  their contaminants loads need to be addressed to better understand the risk from
  consuming these products. The aquatic biota from the Baie des Chaleurs in New Brunswick
  is contaminated by cadmium, zinc and lead. In spite of this, no study has examined
  the heavy metal concentrations in commercial halieutic products sold in this Canadian
  region. The objective of this pilot study was to characterize the species and origin
  of fish and seafood sold in the Baie des Chaleurs region by using an ecosystemic
  approach. Additionally, a baseline picture of the heavy metal levels found in these
  products has been determined. In 2008, interviews were carried out in markets located
  in the Baie des Chaleurs area. Species that were identified as the most purchased
  were then bought for analysis. Samples were freeze-dried and homogenized before
  nitric acid digestions. Aluminum, copper, cadmium, iron, manganese, and zinc concentrations
  were determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry. Results
  show that 36 % of seafood species sold in markets were caught in the Baie des Chaleurs.
  Lobsters, shrimps, scallops and oysters are the most purchased species regardless
  of the season. High amounts of cadmium exceeding tolerable daily intake are found
  in lobster hepatopancreas and can cause deleterious effects on health, in particular
  in vulnerable populations such as children and heavy consumers. The ecosystemic
  approach to health used in this pilot study shows the feasibility of an exhaustive
  study on the exposure of coastal population to heavy metal from fish and seafood
  consumption and the source of halieutic products sold in markets.\n\nThe online
  version of this article  contains supplementary material, which is available to
  authorized users.\n\nEcosystemic approach to health Consumer products Contamination
  Fish consumption Halieutic product Lobster Risk assessment\n\nFish and seafood,
  which are part of a healthy diet, bioaccumulate heavy metals. In particular, the
  bioaccumulation of cadmium, arsenic, manganese, mercury, and lead  in the trophic
  food chain is cause of concern since they can have deleterious effects on human
  health. Furthermore, fish and seafood are one of the main links between heavy metal
  present in the environment and human exposure.\n\nThe Baie des Chaleurs region is
  a rural area of New Brunswick where lives approximately 100,000 inhabitants. The
  economy of this region is based on fishery, tourism, forestry and heavy industries.
  Most of the heavy industries such as a lead smelter and petroleum-fuelled thermal
  power plants are known for their heavy metal releases in the environment. These
  industries are located in three industrial centers of the Baie des Chaleurs: Dalhousie,
  Belledune and Bathurst. In particular, Dalhousie has high levels of Hg, while Belledune
  has high levels of Cd, Pb and zinc  in sediments and aquatic biota.\n\nCoastal communities
  depending on fishery resources, like the Baie des Chaleurs population located in
  northeastern New Brunswick and the Gaspsie peninsula in Qubec, Canada, are more
  vulnerable to contamination since they tend to consume more fish than the general
  population. Previous studies of halieutic products fished in the Baie des Chaleurs
  showed heavy metal contamination  near industrial sites. These studies focused on
  species fished directly in the Baie des Chaleurs  and overlooked fish from markets
  where most of people buy their fish.\n\nHigher incidents of some cancers and other
  health problems  have been reported in the Baie des Chaleurs region compared to
  other New Brunswick regions. This has created concerns in the local population concerning
  their exposure to regional pollutants. Exposure studies often try to link local
  ecosystem to human health. However, with the globalization of food systems, fishes
  sold in markets do not necessarily come from the Baie des Chaleurs. Ecosystemic
  approach to health takes into account complexity and system thinking as a way to
  address social determinants of health while also fostering ecosystem sustainability.
  Use of an ecosystemic approach to health, i.e., looking at and characterizing fish
  and seafood available in markets and groceries, can starts to address social and
  environmental determinants of exposure to contaminants via fish and seafood consumption.
  This approach adds an additional layer of complexity through visualization of the
  globalization of the food system. It addresses issues of concerns to the local population,
  places the community as an integral part of the ecosystem, and takes into account
  the environment as a complex dynamic system composed by several scales.\n\nTo better
  understand the link between local ecosystem and exposure to heavy metal of human
  population from their seafood and fish consumption, this study aims to:  determine
  the types and origins of halieutic products sold, and  establish an overview of
  heavy metal contamination of principal species of fish sold in Baie des Chaleurs
  stores and also begins to address social and environmental determinants of exposure
  to contaminants via fish and seafood consumption.\n\nSince most people buy their
  halieutic products from groceries or fish markets, merchants were chosen to make
  the link between the halieutic industries and local population as they can provide
  insight of the consumption habits of communities.\n\nIn August and October 2008,
  markets from different municipalities selling halieutic products located along the
  Baie des Chaleurs in New Brunswick were visited in order to present the project
  to managers or owners. Eight markets, divided equally between groceries and fish
  markets, have accepted to take part to the study. All stores were located between
  Dalhousie and Caraquet and gave a good spatial representation of the different communities
  in the Baie des Chaleurs region. After informed consent was given, a short interview
  with the person responsible for purchasing halieutic products was conducted to obtain
  information about:  the store,  their customers and  the species and the origins
  of halieutic products sold. Fish and seafood were then bought based on what species
  sell the best and their availability. Information about the fish and seafood bought,
  such as their origins, the part of the fish  and the mode of preservation were recorded.
  All steps of this study were approved by the ethical committee of the Universit
  de Moncton.\n\nFor heavy metal analysis, a total of 42 fresh samples and 17 canned
  products of fish and seafood were bought from market. Also, nine lobsters were purchased
  in summer 2006 directly from fishermen on the wharf of three localities of the Baie
  des Chaleurs region.\n\nFish and seafood samples were collected and stored individually
  in sterile polyethylene scintillation vials at 20 C as follow:  for fish and crustacean,
  pieces of flesh were took;  for lobster, hepatopancreas, claw and tail tissues were
  sampled;  for shrimps, oysters, mussels and scallops, samples from the same market,
  origin and species were pooled;  the content of each canned products was mixed and
  homogenized. Ten percent of all samples were analyzed in triplicate. All samples
  were freeze-dried and homogenized before analysis. Samples were digested using the
  United States Environmental Protection Agency  method 3050B which consist to a concentrated
  nitric acid digestion at 95 C followed by a 30 % hydrogen peroxide treatment. Aluminum,
  copper, Cd, Fe, Mn, and Zn concentrations were determined by inductively coupled
  plasma optical emission spectrometry  at Environment Canada laboratory. All glass
  equipment was cleaned with 10 % nitric acid and stainless steel tools were used
  for dissection. Before each analysis, a calibration curve was made and standards
  \ were continually verified. Certified reference material, DORM-2 and DORM-3, blanks,
  sampling triplicates, and analysis duplicates were used to validate the concentrations
  obtained. Results respect all quality assurance and quality control criteria.\n\nComparison
  of measured and certified concentrations of heavy metals in two certified reference
  materials and sampling triplicates and analysis duplicates recoveries  \n\nThe answers
  from the interviews and information on product purchased have been compiled by simple
  statistics such as percentages and means. In order to obtain a representation of
  concentrations of heavy metal found in fish and seafood, results are presented as
  geometric means, which compensate for the skewing effect of very high levels and
  the small sample number of each species. When concentrations were under the detection
  limit, half the limit was used to perform statistics. Since number of individual
  replicates can be low and may contribute to high standard deviation, each species
  was organized into four separate categories according to their taxonomic rank in
  order to allow statistical comparisons. Lobster hepatopancreas and shrimp form distinct
  categories. ANOVA tests were performed in order to compare heavy metal concentration
  for each category. Heavy metal concentrations were log-transformed to respect the
  normality and homogeneity of residuals of the statistical model, which were tested
  with a ShapiroWilk test. The statistical differences were established to p ; 0.05.
  To detect where differences lie between categories, the TukeyKramer test was used.
  SAS System for Windows 9.00 was used for all statistical analyses.\n\nTo assess
  the risks to health from exposure to heavy metals, the Joint FAO/WHO Export Committee
  on Food Additives established, for each metal, an estimated maximum amount of an
  agent expressed on a body mass basis, to which individuals in a population may be
  exposed daily over their lifetimes without appreciable health risk. This value can
  be expressed in micrograms per kilogram of body weight per day  or per week. Table
  2 presents PTDIs of analyzed heavy metals. We calculated the maximum tolerable concentration
  that food may contain for an adult  or child, which eat two servings  as recommended
  by Canadas Food Guide or five servings  per week  without exceeding PTDIs of each
  heavy metal. These values, presented in Table 2, were used as the base of comparisons
  to evaluate the possible exposure to heavy metal from halieutic products.\n\nMaximum
  heavy metal concentrations  calculated for an adult and a child eating two and five
  servings per week using the WHOs PTDI  \n\nThis pilot study gives an overview of
  aquatic species sold in Baie des Chaleurs stores and their origin. It also reveals
  the major trends of heavy metal concentrations in fish and seafood bought in this
  region. The fish markets and groceries sampled offer a wide variety of fish and
  seafood from various part of the world, although the majority comes from Canada.
  Data show that over a third of species sold in fish markets visited come from Baie
  des Chaleurs and most of the clients are locals, although tourism increases customer
  traffic during the summer. The most purchased species  in markets visited, i.e.,
  lobster, shrimp, scallop, and oyster, come mostly from the Baie des Chaleurs. Thus,
  it is probable that the percentage of fish and seafood coming from the Baie des
  Chaleurs, in term of quantity, is higher than the 36 % observed in term of number
  of species. It should be kept in mind that seasons influence best sellers species
  \ and seems to follow commercial fishing season.\n\nMain results from the interviews
  carried out with fish market or grocery store merchants  \n\naThis question was
  subdivided in five individual questions in the interviews, to separate seasonal
  and annual responses.\n\nThe results of the interview with merchants reflected the
  globalization of the food system. Groceries store tend to sell more fish and seafood
  from international origin  than local fish markets. Moreover, canned products come
  mainly from countries outside Canada. This confirms the importance of determining
  the appropriate geographical range and using ecosystemic approaches to understand
  the provenance of the species that are currently consumed by inhabitants of the
  Baie des Chaleurs, especially when considering that people are not always informed
  of the origin of the products they buy. To get a better understanding of this globalization
  trend, we need to determine consumption and dietary habits of local populations
  of the Baie des Chaleurs.\n\nThis study shows that consumers rarely ask to the origin
  of the fish and seafood that they buy. Origins of halieutic products sold are generally
  well known by merchants interviewed  but are not displayed. This phenomenon is not
  unique to the Baie des Chaleurs region; it was also observed in a study conducted
  in New Jersey by Burger et al.. However, since fishing regions of commercial seafood
  products have different levels of heavy metal contamination, the provenance of fish
  and seafood and information regarding the contamination of halieutic products from
  these regions should be displayed. Together, this information would allow consumers
  to make informed choices about their consumption of fish and seafood. This is important
  since fish consumption advisories are often normalized to an average meal intake
  of a large population  or recommended fish portions in a given time  and are not
  adapted to local context.\n\nSocioeconomic, cultural, and regional characteristics
  can lead to higher consumption of fish and seafood and at the same time lead to
  greater exposure to contaminants. For example, native people and fishermen tend
  to eat more fish than other groups. Thus, since the Baie des Chaleurs is a coastal
  region, it is probable that the inhabitants eat more halieutic products per week
  then the Canadas Food Guide minimum recommendation and therefore are more likely
  to be exposed to contaminants.\n\nThe risk assessment results for children  and
  heavy consumers of halieutic products show the importance of considering vulnerable
  groups in risk assessment studies and not normalize to the general population only.
  Several values of heavy metal concentrations in fish and seafood are lower than
  our limits of detection, and, as such, were all well below the PTDIs. The detected
  levels of heavy metal from fish  generally do not exceed PTDIs, even for children
  who eat up to five servings  of fish per week. Considering categories, only Cd concentrations
  in lobster hepatopancreas largely exceed PTDI for all groups. This part of the crustacean
  is known for its high concentrations of Cd. Studies suggest that chronic exposure
  to Cd can lead to bones and kidney diseases  as well as lungs and prostate cancer.
  High Cd concentrations in lobster hepatopancreas demonstrate the importance to consider
  the nature of the parts  of fish and seafood consumed. Heavy metal concentrations
  in other species can also exceed some PTDIs criteria. It is the case of Al and Cd
  in canned mussels and Cd in canned oyster. In fact, seafood preserved in cans seems
  to have higher metal concentrations  compared to fresh seafood and to concentrations
  reported in other studies. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated in other types
  of canned products that metal contents can be higher. This suggests that preservation
  mode influences heavy metal concentrations in fish. It would be important to study
  heavy metal concentrations in fish and seafood before and after canning process.\n\nGeometric

  \n\nHeavy metal concentrations  in fish and seafood reported in other studies  \n\nBased
  on this pilot study, it was possible to identify species that offer low levels of
  metals and that are known to contain high concentration of fatty acids, such as
  herring, sardine, trout, and salmon. Further studies on these species, including
  analyzing other types of contaminants, such as organochlorines, endocrine disruptors,
  dioxins, and furans, would allow a better understanding of the risk assessment of
  these species. It is to be noted that the Canadas Food Guide also values these four
  species, in addition to mackerel and char, as good choices for health.\n\nThis pilot
  study sets the foundation for using ecosystemic approaches to health by utilizing
  social aspects of food consumption  and examining heavy metal contamination throughout
  different scales. It demonstrates the feasibility and the necessity of more exhaustive
  studies on the exposure of coastal population in the Baie des Chaleurs to heavy
  metal from fish and seafood consumption. It also shows the importance of focusing
  studies on the source of halieutic products sold in markets and the link to the
  local ecosystem, as well as the impacts of seafood and fish consumption on the health
  of Baie des Chaleurs inhabitants. The current study also helps to established links
  with stakeholders of the Baie des Chaleurs, which is essential to this type of research
  where results need to be accepted and used by the communities.\n\nIn order to confirm
  the results obtained in this study, it will be essential to increase sample number.
  It is also important to study species that are more contaminated, purchased by consumers
  \ and preserved in canned. Moreover, the region where fish and seafood were caught
  should be taken into account since heavy metals exposure depends on these parameters.
  To evaluate actual exposure of the local population, it will is essential to also
  determine diet habits  of halieutic products by working with local inhabitants,
  including vulnerable groups such as children and fishermen. The ultimate goal of
  studies to follow is to develop tools to help local consumers make informed decisions
  about their fish consumption in order to balance health risks related to environmental
  pollutants and benefits of eating fish. This goal will ultimately be achieved by
  utilizing ecosystemic approaches to health that take into account scale, social,
  and environmental determinants of health, and through the involvement of local populations
  in each step of this research.\n\nWe are thankful to merchants for their participation,
