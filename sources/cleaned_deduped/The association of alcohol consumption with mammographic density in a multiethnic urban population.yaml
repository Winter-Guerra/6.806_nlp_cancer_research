text: "\n\nAlcohol consumption is associated with higher breast cancer risk. While
  studies suggest a modest association between alcohol intake and mammographic density,
  few studies have examined the association in racial/ethnic minority populations.
  \n\nWe assessed dense breast area and total breast area from digitized film mammograms
  in an urban cohort of African American, African Caribbean, white, and Hispanic Caribbean
  \ women. We examined the association between alcohol intake and mammographic density.
  We used linear regression to examine mean differences in mammographic density across
  alcohol intake categories. We considered confounding by age, body mass index, hormone
  contraceptive use, family history of breast cancer, menopausal status, smoking status,
  nativity, race/ethnicity, age at first birth, and parity. \n\nFifty percent currently
  consumed alcohol. Women who consumed &gt;7 servings/week of alcohol, but not those
  consuming 7 servings/week, had higher percent density compared to nondrinkers after
  full adjustments  1.8, 14.6; 7  = -0.5, 95% CI -3.7, 2.8). There was a positive
  association between high alcohol intake and dense area after full adjustments. We
  did not observe race/ethnicity modification of the association between alcohol intake
  and percent density. In women with a BMI of ;25 kg/m2, drinkers consuming &gt;7
  servings/week of alcohol had a 17% increase in percent density compared to nondrinkers
  \ and there was no association in women with a BMI  25 kg/m2  after adjusting for
  age and BMI. \n\nIn a racially/ethnically diverse cohort, women who consumed &gt;7
  servings/week of alcohol, especially those with a BMI &lt; 25 kg/m2, had higher
  percent density. \n\nBreast density, or mammographic density, is one of the strongest
  intermediate markers for breast cancer - women with high mammographic densities
  have a 4-6 fold increase risk of developing breast cancer in comparison to those
  with low mammographic densities. Unlike many breast cancer risk factors, mammographic
  density is modifiable. Tamoxifen and raloxifene use have been shown to decrease
  mammographic density and combined hormone replacement therapy has been shown to
  increase mammographic density in the range of 5-10%. \n\nAlcohol intake has been
  consistently associated with breast cancer in the range of a 7-12% increased relative
  risk for every 10 grams per day of ethanol intake,. With few exceptions -, the majority
  of studies suggest a modest positive association between alcohol intake and mammographic
  density -, although in many studies the estimates have high imprecision -. Though
  the magnitude of association between alcohol intake and mammographic density vary
  based on method of mammographic density assessment, using a continuous measure of
  assessment, there is a 2-12% increase in mammographic density with daily alcohol
  intake,,. The few studies that have examined alcohol intake and mammographic density
  in racially and ethnically diverse cohorts have not reported major racial/ethnic
  differences in the association,,,. Nevertheless, there is well established racial/ethnic
  variation in breast cancer incidence and mortality. There are also race/ethnic differences
  in alcohol intake. According to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism,
  a greater proportion of African American and Hispanic women report abstaining from
  current alcohol intake  compared to non-Hispanic white women ; however, weekly heavy
  drinking  is higher in African American  and non-Hispanic white women  than in Hispanic
  women. Alcohol is a carcinogen with biologic activity that has direct and indirect
  effects on breast tissue,,. \n\nAlcohol consumption is a modifiable breast cancer
  risk factor that may impact breast cancer risk via mammographic density. Breast
  cancer incidence and tumor characteristics show substantial variation by race/ethnicity,
  with Hispanic and African American women having lower odds of early stage breast
  cancer diagnosis and African American women experiencing higher incidence of invasive
  breast cancer in younger ages,,. African American women also experience a higher
  prevalence of triple negative breast cancers, which is compelling given the literature
  suggests that alcohol intake is more strongly associated with hormone receptor positive
  breast cancer compared to hormone receptor negative breast cancers -. Studies also
  suggest racial/ethnic variation in mammographic density,-. Given that alcohol consumption
  differ across racial/ethnic groups, understanding the associations between these
  factors and mammographic density in diverse population can provide insight into
  the contribution of modifiable risk factors for breast cancer in population subgroups
  and improve our etiologic and prevention research. In a multiethnic cohort of women,
  we examined the association between alcohol consumption and mammographic density,
  as measured by percent density, dense area, and non-dense area. \n\nThe New York
  City Multiethnic Breast Cancer Project is a collaborative study between Columbia
  University in Manhattan and Long Island University and Long Island College Hospital
  in Brooklyn. In brief, we recruited 200 women between 2007 and 2008, ages 40-60
  years, who completed an in-person interview and provided a signed medical release
  form to allow us to retrieve their mammograms. We excluded data from 4 women whose
  mammograms were of poor quality or unavailable and 5 women who had a previous diagnosis
  of breast cancer. After these exclusions, 191 women remained eligible for the data
  analysis. We excluded two women who had incomplete alcohol data leaving a final
  sample size of 189 women. All participants provided written informed consent. The
  Internal Review Boards at Columbia University, Long Island University, and Long
  Island College Hospital in Brooklyn approved this study. \n\nWe collected epidemiologic
  data through a 30-45 minute in-person interview. Specifically, we collected information
  on sociodemographic factors, body mass index, reproductive history, and family and
  personal cancer history. We categorized race/ethnicity groups based on self-reported
  data on race, Hispanic ethnicity, personal and parental birthplace as described
  previously. We considered Caribbean women to be women who reported being born or
  having at least one parent born in a Caribbean country. We divided Caribbean women
  into African Caribbean  and Hispanic Caribbean. We categorized non-Caribbean participants
  as non-Caribbean Hispanic, African American, white, and other race/ethnicities.
  \n\nAs part of the in-person interview, we asked women about their alcohol intake
  behaviors. We asked women if they had ever consumed alcoholic beverages such as
  coolers, beer, wine, champagne, or liquor at least once a month for six months or
  more. We defined women who responded no as never drinkers. Women who responded yes
  were defined as ever drinkers. Ever drinkers were then asked to consider the last
  12 months and report if they had consumed coolers, beer, wine or champagne, or liquor
  at least once a month for six months. We considered women who reported that they
  did not drink during the past 12 months as former drinkers. We then asked women
  who reported consumption of any of the beverage types to detail the frequency of
  consumption and the number of servings ) usually consumed on the days they drank
  the particular beverage type. We calculated total weekly grams  of ethanol consumed
  based on the number of servings using the US Department of Agriculture guidelines
  for ethanol content. We also calculated the number of servings per week of alcohol.
  We categorized alcohol intake as a dichotomous variable  and by using guidelines
  on nutrition and cancer prevention,. We created independent dichotomous variables
  for current wine intake, current beer intake, and current liquor intake. We did
  not create a dichotomous variable for cooler intake because the sample size was
  too small to analyze separately. \n\nDetails on mammographic density assessment
  have been described previously. A single expert reader, blinded to other study data,
  assessed dense area and breast area from digitized film mammogram images, using
  the Cumulus threshold software. We calculated percent density as the total dense
  area divided by the total breast area, multiplied by 100. We calculated non-dense
  \ area as the total breast area minus the total dense area. Ten percent of the films
  were read in duplicate resulting in a Pearson correlation of 0.99 for breast area
  and 0.9 for dense area for the repeated readings. \n\nWe examined the distribution
  of sociodemographic factors and current alcohol intake by race/ethnicity. For Table
  1, we presented the four largest racial/ethnic groups: African American, African
  Caribbean, white, and Hispanic Caribbean. Hispanic non-Caribbean  and other race/ethnicity
  \ were not included in Table 1 nor are they included in the regression analyses
  because there were too few participants in the groups to analyze separately. We
  performed separate linear regression analyses to examine the mean differences in
  mammographic density across alcohol intake categories in two models. As a secondary
  analysis, we also examined the association by modeling alcohol intake as a continuous
  variable. Model 1 was age-adjusted. Model 2 was additionally adjusted for confounders
  that altered the association between alcohol intake and any of the mammographic
  density measures by more than 10% in the age-adjusted model. We examined potential
  confounding by BMI, race/ethnicity, nativity, reproductive factors, family history
  of breast cancer, and smoking status. Less than 3% of data on confounders was missing.
  We tested for additive interactions between alcohol intake  and race/ethnicity and
  alcohol intake  and BMI  with all confounders within the model with and without
  cross product terms. We further examined the association between the type of alcohol
  consumed and percent density. We used STATA 11.0  for analyses. \n\nTable 1. Distribution
  of sociodemographic factors and current alcohol intake, New York City Multiethnic
  Breast Cancer Project ; 2007-2008\n\nOur study sample included 189 women with an
  average age of 50 years  5.7) at the time of interview and an average BMI of 29.8
  kg/m2, with 35% being postmenopausal. About 13% of women had a first degree relative
  diagnosed with breast cancer. Over two-thirds of women reported having ever used
  hormonal birth control  and having had children  with the average age at birth at
  23 years. Twenty-eight percent of women were former and 11% were current smokers.
  \n\nOver one-third of the women were born outside the US  and the racial/ethnic
  composition of the samples was as follow: African American, African Caribbean, white,
  and Hispanic Caribbean. Hispanic Caribbean women had lower percent density than
  Hispanic non-Caribbean women; therefore, we chose not to combine these groups  8.5
  \ and 18.8, respectively). White women had a lower average BMI  compared to African
  American women. There were no differences by race/ethnicity for percent density
  or dense area but white women had lower non-dense  area compared to African American,
  African Caribbean, and Hispanic Caribbean women. \n\nNondrinkers included 95 women
  of which 69 had never consumed alcohol  and 26 were former alcohol consumers. The
  average  alcohol intake for current drinkers was 62.7  grams of ethanol per week
  or about 4.3 servings/week. Although the average  percent density ) and dense area
  ) for current alcohol consumers was higher compared to non-current alcohol consumers
  \ and dense area 16.7 ), the comparisons were not significant. The majority of US
  born women were current drinkers  in contrast to Caribbean born women. African American,
  African Caribbean, and white women had a higher weekly intake of alcohol compared
  to Hispanic Caribbean women. Although less than 40% of African Caribbean women drank
  alcohol, those that drank had the highest weekly servings of alcohol. The majority
  of alcohol consumers were wine drinkers  with far fewer women who reported beer,
  liquor, or cooler  intake. African Caribbean women on average consumed a greater
  amount of liquor  35.2  servings/week) compared to African American women  2.6  servings/week);
  however, this was driven by one African Caribbean woman reporting 70 servings/week
  of liquor. As our primary exposure construct was categorical, this value does not
  alter the estimates. When our construct is modeled continuously, this value does
  not change overall estimates. \n\nWomen who consumed &gt;7 servings/week of alcohol,
  but not those drinking 7 servings/week, had higher mean percent density in comparison
  to nondrinkers after adjusting for age and BMI. The associations remained in the
  fully adjusted models. Similarly, women who consumed &gt;7 servings/week of alcohol
  had an 8 cm2 larger dense area compared to nondrinkers  in the age adjusted model;
  the association was attenuated after adjusting for BMI, hormone contraceptive use,
  family history of breast cancer, menopausal status, current smoking status, nativity,
  race/ethnicity, age at first birth centered at the mean, and parity. Alcohol consumption
  was not associated with non-dense area in fully adjusted models. In addition to
  including alcohol as a categorical variable, we modeled alcohol consumption as a
  continuous variable. We observed a linear positive relationship between alcohol
  intake  and percent density after fully adjusting for confounders, but found no
  association between alcohol intake and dense area  or non-dense area. \n\nTable

  New York City Multiethnic Breast Cancer Project ; 2007-2008\n\nIn race/ethnic-stratified
  analyses after adjusting for age and continuous BMI, the confounders specific to
  percent density, we observed no associations between alcohol intake and percent
  density in African American, African Caribbean, and Hispanic women. White women
  who consumed &gt;7 servings/week of alcohol had a 16% increase in percent density
  \ after adjusting for age and BMI; however, only 5 women reported consuming at this
  level. Results for race/ethnic stratified analyses were essentially the same after
  fully adjusting for confounders where the strongest association was observed in
  white women who consumed &gt;7 servings/week of alcohol. We also observed a strong
  positive linear relationship between alcohol intake  and percent density in fully
  adjusted models in white women only. There was no additive interaction between alcohol
  intake and race/ethnicity when examining percent density, dense area, or non-dense
  area. However, race/ethnic stratified analyses for dense area suggest stronger effects
  in white women and African Caribbean women. \n\nFigure 1. Multiple linear regression
  coefficients for the association between percent density and current alcohol intake
  \ by race/ethnicity, New York City Multiethnic Breast Cancer Project ; 2007-2008.
  Models are adjusted for age at interview  and BMI. a Hispanic Caribbean women do
  not report consuming &gt;7 servings/week of alcohol. \n\nIn BMI-stratified analyses
  adjusted for age and continuous BMI, percent density specific confounders, in women
  with a BMI of &lt;25 kg/m2, those who consumed &gt;7 servings/week of alcohol had
  a 17% increase in percent density. There was no association between percent density
  and alcohol consumption in women with a BMI = 25- &lt; 30 kg/m2  or BMI  30 kg/m2.
  Results for BMI-stratified analyses were essentially the same after fully adjusting
  for all confounders. Further, results were confirmed in fully adjusted models where
  we also observed a positive linear relationship between alcohol intake modeled as
  a continuous variable  and percent density in women with a BMI of &lt;25 kg/m2  and
  null associations in women with a BMI  25 kg/m2. We observed statistical interaction
  between alcohol intake and BMI on an additive scale when we modeled for percent
  density. In contrast, we observed no interaction with BMI when we examined dense
  area or non-dense area. However, similar to percent density after adjusting for
  age and BMI, when we modeled for dense area we observed stronger associations in
  women with a BMI of &lt;25 kg/m2. Women consuming &gt;7 servings/week of alcohol
  had greater dense area, but the association did not reach significance. \n\nFigure
  2. Multiple linear regression coefficients for the association between percent density
  and current alcohol intake  by BMI, New York City Multiethnic Breast Cancer Project
  ; 2007-2008. Models are adjusted for age at interview  and BMI. \n\nWe examined
  the association between alcohol beverage type and percent density because we observed
  an association between alcohol intake and percent density in our main analyses.
  In comparison to women who did not consume wine, wine intake was associated with
  a 4.1% increase in percent density in the age-adjusted model ; however, the association
  was attenuated after adjusting for BMI, beer intake, liquor intake, and cooler intake.
  We observed no association between beer intake and percent density  or liquor intake
  and percent density  when adjusted for age, BMI, and intake of other types of alcohol.
  \n\nWe observed that high levels of alcohol consumption  were associated with an
  increase in percent density, and though results for dense area were similar, but
  not statistically significant, an increase in dense area. We found no association
  between alcohol intake and non-dense area. Our results for linear associations between
  mammographic density measures and alcohol intake in g/week confirmed these findings.
  Although we were limited with our overall sample size and cannot conclude modification
  by race/ethnicity, the race/ethnic-stratified analyses did suggest stronger associations
  between alcohol intake and percent density in white women. We also found women with
  a BMI &lt; 25 kg/m2 may be at greater risk for higher mammographic density associated
  with alcohol intake. \n\nOur study observed an approximate 8% increase in the relative
  amount of mammographic density with high alcohol intake, which is within range of
  other breast cancer risk factors known to modify mammographic density,. With few
  exceptions,,, our findings are consistent with prior studies that show a positive
  association between mammographic density and current alcohol intake,,,,,-, although
  the precision for many of these estimates is highly variable. In studies that examine
  beverage type,-, the majority confirm a positive association between wine intake
  and mammographic density,,. We found a positive association between wine intake
  and percent density; however, the association was attenuated after adjusting for
  age and BMI. The inconsistencies across studies may be attributed to a variety of
  factors, including but not limited to, different methods of measuring mammographic
  density, low levels of alcohol intake, alcohols varied roles in carcinogenesis,
  and additional factors that modify alcohols effect. First, studies using BI-RADS
  and Wolfe classification patterns capture variation in the extent of mammographic
  density across only four categories; therefore, studies using these categorical
  measures of mammographic density require larger changes to reflect a categorical
  change. In contrast, studies capturing variation in mammographic density through
  continuous measures that are based on computer threshold programs require smaller
  changes to reflect mammographic density change. Second, some of the strongest findings
  for the association between mammographic density and alcohol intake have been in
  populations with high levels of alcohol consumption. While the Norwegian cohort
  with an average consumption of 6 g/day alcohol did not find an association with
  percent density, in a Mediterranean population with consumption levels at the highest
  tertile starting at 12.0 g/day of alcohol, a positive association was observed in
  pre- and post-menopausal women. Similarly, in the New York site of the National
  Collaborative Perinatal Project  cohort with a reported average consumption of 4.37
  servings/week, alcohol intake was positively associated with mammographic density.
  Third, alcohol is known to play multiple mechanistic roles in carcinogenesis that
  are not measured in our analysis, such as the evidence for the role of insulin-like
  growth factor-1. Studies suggest that alcohol can increase IGF-1 levels by stimulation
  of the liver post-alcohol consumption. Furthermore, increased IGF-1 has been associated
  with increased breast cancer risk -, mammographic density  -, and alcohol consumption.
  Alcohol can also increase circulating estrogen levels and there is a positive association
  between circulating estrogen and breast cancer development. Estrogen may induce
  hormone mediated cell proliferation that can result in genetic alterations and greater
  opportunity for genetic damage,. The variability in studies examining the association
  between mammographic density and current alcohol could be due to IGF-1 or circulating
  estrogen levels. Future epidemiological studies with biomarker availability are
  needed to explore this further. Lastly, the inconsistencies across studies may be
  attributed to study population variation in factors such as genetic make-up, diet,
  and sociodemographic and hormonal factors  that have all been associated with modifying
  alcohols effect on breast cancer risk,. \n\nStudies are inconsistent as to whether
  mammographic density varies across race/ethnicity,-. While none of our cross-product
  terms between alcohol intake and race/ethnicity reached statistical significance,
  we observed stronger associations between current alcohol intake and mammographic
  density in whites. However, we are limited in the ability to test for interactions
  by race/ethnicity due to small sample sizes as very limited numbers of women consumed
  more than 7 servings/week of alcohol. Nevertheless, similar to other studies,, we
  found no association between mammographic density and alcohol intake among Hispanic
  women. In the Chicago Breast Health Project that consists of 296 Hispanic women,
  alcohol intake was not associated with mammographic density. The lack of an association
  may have been attributed to very low levels of alcohol intake given that only 22%
  of women reported consuming more than 1 serving/week. Hispanic Caribbean women in
  our cohort also reported low levels of alcohol consumption with an average intake
  of 1 serving/week. The association between alcohol intake and mammographic density
  has been rarely studied among women of African descent but in the NCPP cohort, a
  positive association was reported for increasing current alcohol intake and increasing
  mammographic density in African American women. In our study, despite our African
  American women having similar alcohol intake levels as white women, there was no
  association between alcohol intake and percent density in African American women.
  Breast cancer mortality is higher among African American women, and women who immigrate
  to the United States and their female offspring also experience an increased risk
  of breast cancer. Large epidemiological studies of a heterogeneous population of
  women of African descent are needed to understand the association between alcohol
  intake and mammographic density, two modifiable breast cancer risk factors. \n\nLimited
  studies ascertain the association between alcohol and multiple measures of mammographic
  density. While our dense area results also suggested a positive relationship, the
  association did not reach statistical significance. Percent density is a proportion
  of the total breast area and is greatly influenced by body size; whereas, dense
  area is less influenced by body size. Our cohort had a higher average BMI  29.8
  ) than the NCPP cohort  27.6 ), and these differences in BMI may account for the
  different results across the two studies suggesting that body size may impact our
  overall findings. We observed a stronger positive association between alcohol intake
  and percent density in women with a BMI &lt; 25 kg/m2 than in women with higher
  BMI. This is consistent with multiple breast cancer studies that show the positive
  association between lifetime alcohol intake and breast cancer risk is strongest
  in leaner women -. In a cohort of postmenopausal Norwegian women, there was no association
  between alcohol intake and mammographic density across tertiles of BMI. In a multiethnic
  cohort of white, African American, and Asian American women, the positive associations
  between mammographic density and breast cancer risk were stronger in the leanest
  women and the most obese women. If associations are strongest in the leanest women,
  given that all of our women with a BMI &gt; 25 kg/m2 were women of African descent,
  this may explain why we do not see a strong association between high levels of alcohol
  intake  and mammographic density in women of African descent. Fat tissue can contribute
  to estrogen production which can lead to increased breast cancer risk -. Therefore,
  future studies should stratify or select based on BMI to further better understand
  the contribution of alcohol consumption to mammographic density across BMI level.
  \n\nLimitations of our study include the possibility of information bias due to
  self-reported alcohol intake. However, women being screened likely did not know
  their mammographic density resulting in non-differential bias. People are also known
  to under-report alcohol intake, which would result in an under-estimation of the
  magnitude of association. Our study is limited in the number of women who reported
  consuming &gt;7 servings/week, which contributed to large confidence intervals.
  However, when we modeled alcohol intake as a continuous variable we confirmed the
  positive relationship between alcohol intake and mammographic density. We also acknowledge
  that given the estimates observed for white women are similar to the estimates observed
  for women with a BMI &lt; 25 kg/m2; these two analyses may be capturing similarities
  and in fact for women consuming &gt;7 servings/week of alcohol with a BMI &lt; 25
  kg/m2, 4 of the 5 women were white. Further, we are unable to examine the associations
  between alcohol intake and mammographic density stratified by nativity given the
  small number of women that consume high amounts of alcohol  and are born outside
  the US. We also did not assess levels of alcohol intake in earlier life periods;
  however, many studies have shown that current alcohol, and not past alcohol intake,
  is associated with increased mammographic density,,. \n\nMammographic density is
  one of the strongest intermediate markers for breast cancer risk and is regularly
  clinically screened at mammography visits. With over one-third of states passing
  a version of the Breast Density Notification Law that mandates release of high mammographic
  density information to women, women may begin to seek information on how to modify
  their mammographic density to reduce their breast cancer risk. Alcohol consumption
  has been consistently associated with breast cancer risk and our study supports
  an association with increased mammographic density. Future studies should evaluate
  whether decreasing alcohol intake is associated with a reduction in mammographic
  density. Identifying women at higher risk of breast cancer because of their mammographic
  density would be an important time to reinforce prevention messages about alcohol
  intake. Further, investigating differences in alcohol and mammographic density association
  in women with different body size and racial and ethnic backgrounds can inform etiologic
  research as well as prevention efforts. \n\nPT, DR, JDF, and MBT made substantial
