  Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids n-3 PUFAs Decrease Growth and microRNA-21 Expression
  of Estrogen Receptor-Positive E.md
text: '


  microRNA -21 plays a role in carcinogenesis and modulates genes regulating cell
  growth. Consumption of diets rich in the n-3 PUFA alpha-linolenic acid  in animals
  and humans results in elevations of serum ALA, docosahexaenoic acid, and eicosapentaenoic
  acid. Our objective was to determine in vitro the effect of ALA, alone and combined
  with EPA and DHA  on growth of MCF-7 cells and miR-21 expression changes as an underlying
  mechanism. Cells were treated with 112M fatty acids as either ALA alone, or with
  EPA and DHA at ratios found in serum of animals  or humans  or control  plus 1nM
  estrogen, 40M oleic acid and 40M linoleic acid. Cell growth was assessed after 24
  and 48 hours treatment. miR-21 expression was analyzed by qPCR after 1 hour treatment.
  ALA reduced growth by 9% and 28% at 24 and 48 hours, respectively. AnR and HuR reduced
  cell growth by 82% and 37%, respectively, at 24 hours, and 37% for both at 48 hours.
  No change in growth was observed at 1 hour. miR-21 displayed 0.83-fold, 0.25-fold
  and 0.58-fold changes in expression for ALA, AnR and HuR, respectively, following
  1 hour treatment, with AnR miR-21 significantly downregulated  compared to control
  and ALA. A significant relationship was observed between fatty acid effects on miR-21
  at 1 hour and cell growth at 24 hours. AnR contained the highest level of DHA, suggesting
  it is most active in reducing cell growth via effects on miR-21. ALA, when combined
  with DHA and EPA reduces the growth of ER+ breast cancer cells potentially through
  early modulation of miR-21. Funding: NSERC. '
