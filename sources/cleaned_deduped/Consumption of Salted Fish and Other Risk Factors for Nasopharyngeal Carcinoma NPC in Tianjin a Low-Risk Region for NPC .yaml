  of Salted Fish and Other Risk Factors for Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma NPC in Tianjin

  The dietary habits, occupational exposures, use of tobacco and alcohol, and medical
  history were compared among 100 patients with histologically confirmed nasopharyngeal
  carcinoma  in Tianjin City, Peoples Republic of China, and 300 neighborhood controls
  who were individually matched to the patients with regard to age, sex, and race.
  Exposure to salted fish was significantly associated with an increased risk of NPC.
  Four characteristics of exposure to salted fish independently contributed to the
  increased risk:  earlier age at first exposure,  increasing duration of consumption,  increasing
  frequency of consumption, and  cooking the fish by steaming it rather than frying,
  grilling, or boiling it. In addition, significant associations were observed for
  consumption in childhood of salted shrimp paste  and carrots, and the three dietary
  effects  were independent of each other. None of the nondietary factors studied
  were significantly associated with NPC risk.  '
