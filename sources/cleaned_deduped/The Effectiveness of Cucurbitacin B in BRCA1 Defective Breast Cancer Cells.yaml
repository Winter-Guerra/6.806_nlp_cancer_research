  Cucurbitacin B is one of the potential agents for long term anticancer chemoprevention.
  Cumulative evidences has shown that cucurbitacin B provides potent cellular biological
  activities such as hepatoprotective, anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial effects,
  but the precise mechanism of this agent is not clearly understood. We examine the
  biological effects on cancer cells of cucurbitacin B extracted from a Thai herb,
  Trichosanthes cucumerina L. The wild type BRCA1, mutant BRCA1, BRCA1 knocked-down
  and BRCA1 overexpressed breast cancer cells were treated with the cucurbitacin B
  and determined for the inhibitory effects on the cell proliferation, migration,
  invasion, anchorage-independent growth. The gene expressions in the treated cells
  were analyzed for p21/Waf1, p27Kip1 and survivin. Our previous study revealed that
  loss of BRCA1 expression leads to an increase in survivin expression, which is responsible
  for a reduction in sensitivity to paclitaxel. In this work, we showed that cucurbitacin
  B obviously inhibited knocked-down and mutant BRCA1 breast cancer cells rather than
  the wild type BRCA1 breast cancer cells in regards to the cellular proliferation,
  migration, invasion and anchorage-independent growth. Furthermore, forcing the cells
  to overexpress wild type BRCA1 significantly reduced effectiveness of cucurbitacin
  B on growth inhibition of the endogenous mutant BRCA1 cells. Interestingly, cucurbitacin
  B promotes the expression of p21/Waf1 and p27Kip1 but inhibit the expression of
  survivin. We suggest that survivin could be an important target of cucurbitacin
  B in BRCA1 defective breast cancer cells.

  Cucurbitacins are tetracyclic triterpenes isolated from plant in the Cucurbitaceae
  families that has been used in traditional medicine for centuries , . Cucurbitacins
  have potential to be used as a favorable phytochemical for cancer prevention  and
  the compounds continue to be structural improvement for the future chemotherapeutic
  approach. However, the mechanism of antitumor activity of cucurbitacins in breast
  cancer remains unclear. Previous studies showed that some of these compounds have
  a broad range of biological effects, including anti-inflammatory, hepatoprotective
  and anticancer activities –. Cucurbitacins are highly diverse and arbitrarily divided
  into twelve types, the cucurbitacin A to T . Several types of cucurbitacin compounds
  have been studied in vitro and in vivo for their anticancer effects. For example,
  cucurbitacin E treatment can inhibit the viability of pancreatic cancer cells and
  induce apoptosis via suppression of STAT3 phosphorylation and up-regulation of p53
  . Cucurbitacin E also inhibits the proliferation of prostate cancer cells and causes
  disruption of the cytoskeleton structure of actin and vimentin . Cucurbitacin I
  was shown to inhibit nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell proliferation and invasion, and
  also inhibit NPC tumor formation in nude mice . Similar to cucurbitacin E, cucurbitacin
  I can also inhibit STAT3 phosphorylation . Cucurbitacin B is found in many Cucurbitaceae
  species and it is one of the abundant forms of cucurbitacins , . In breast cancer
  cell lines, cucurbitacin B and E glucoside combination as well as each of them can
  induce cell-cycle arrest in the G2/M phase by reducing the amount of p34CDC2/cyclin
  B1 complex . Cucurbitacin glucoside treatment caused changes in the overall breast
  cancer cell morphology from elongated to a round-shaped cell, indicating the impairment
  of actin filament organization . As found in the other cucurbitacins, cucurbitacin
  B has been reported as the antiproliferative agent of breast cancer cells in vitro
  and in vivo  and can induce apoptosis in Bcap37 breast cancer cells . Our previous
  work revealed that cucurbitacin B inhibits growth and telomerase activity in breast
  cancer cell lines and the inhibitory effect was obviously seen in the estrogen receptor-negative
  breast cancer cells SKBR-3 . It also inhibits hTERT and c-Myc protein expression.
  These findings imply that cucurbitacin B exerts an anticancer effect by inhibiting
  telomerase via down regulating both the hTERT and c-Myc expression in breast cancer
  cells.


  Hereditary breast cancer accounts for 5–10% of all breast cancers , . BRCA1 and
  BRCA2 are tumor suppressor genes in which loss or inactivation increases the risk
  of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer , . BRCA1 is a multifunctional protein which
  interacts with various proteins in the nucleus to play roles in DNA repair, transcriptional
  regulation and maintenance genome stability , . Thus, loss of BRCA1 function may
  lead to accumulation of chromosomal damage, abnormality in growth control and finally
  tumorigenesis . Sixty-five percents of Thai familial and early-onset breast/ovarian
  cancer exhibited BRCA1/2 mutations within coding region . The exonic mutation was
  44% cancer related frameshift mutation while 21% was missense mutation. , .


  Two BRCA1 mutations found in high risk breast/ovarian cancer families in Thailand
  are missense mutation in exon 11 in which the bases change from T to C at nucleotide
  2685 and nonsense mutation of deleted A at nucleotide 3300. The two mutations cause
  amino acid changes from Tyrosine to Histidine in codon 856 and the stop site at
  codon 1061, respectively . These two mutations might interfere with the gene functions
  and could be resulted in an increased risk of cancer.


  The presence or absence of functional BRCA1 has a significant effect on the cellular
  proliferation as well as the response to chemotherapy. BRCA1 is therefore suggested
  to be a potential predictive biomarker in the treatment of breast cancer . BRCA1
  has shown to regulate sensitivity of cancer cells to some chemotherapeutic agents.
  The lack of BRCA1 with deficient DNA repair results in increased sensitivity to
  DNA damage-based chemotherapeutics, while the presence of BRCA1 promotes sensitivity
  to antimicrotubule agents probably through modulation of cell cycle and apoptosis
  . We recently reported that BRCA1 down-modulates the malignant behavior of breast
  cancer cells in regard to cell proliferation, migration, invasion and anchorage-independent
  growth. BRCA1 promotes the expression of the cell cycle check point proteins p21/Waf1
  and p27Kip1 and inhibits the expression of an anti-apoptotic protein survivin .
  Loss of BRCA1 expression leads to an increase in survivin expression, leading to
  reduce paclitaxel sensitivity . This drug is highly cytotoxic to breast cancer cells
  which are dued to its interference with microtubule function as well as apoptotic
  induction –. Apart from the role of survivin in malignant progression, this factor
  also plays a crucial role in blocking drug-induced apoptosis and hence it is a critical
  determinant of drug resistance , .


  Cell migration, invasion and growth in an anchorage independent are the characteristics
  of malignant tumors . Survival rate of patients can exceed up to 90 percent when
  breast carcinoma still remains in breast tissue. However, long term survival and
  curable rate decrease as the cancer cells have metastasized. Thus, high effective
  treatment is necessary in order to increase survival rate and prevent tumors metastasis.
  In this work, we report the biological effects of cucurbitacin B extracted from
  medicinal herb Trichosanthes cucumerina L. , on human breast cancer cells with or
  without functional BRCA1. The malignant properties regarding to cellular proliferation,
  migration, invasion, anchorage-independent growth, expression of p21/Waf1, p27Kip1
  and survivin in the breast cancer cells are reported herein.






  Isolation of cucurbitacins from fruit of Trichosanthes cucumerina L. was performed
  as described previously . All necessary permits were obtained for the described
  field studies. In this study the purified cucurbitacin B was dissolved in 1% dimethylsulfoxide
  and diluted with Dulbeccos modified Eagles medium to the desired concentrations
  prior to use.




  BRCA1 wild type cells and BRCA1 mutant cells were purchased from the American Type
  Culture Collection. All cell lines were cultured in DMEM supplemented with sodium
  bicarbonate, peptone, vitamins, amino acids and 5% fetal bovine serum. All cells
  were cultured at 37°C in 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere.




  Plasmid of shRNA-BRCA1 expression vector targeting BRCA1 and its corresponding scrambled
  control vector were constructed as previously described . Plasmids of shRNA-BRCA1
  or shRNA-scrambled control were transfected into the cells with endogenous wild
  type BRCA1 in order to knock down the gene expression. Stable BRCA1 knocked-down
  or shRNA-scrambled control transfectants were established as previously described
  . Transfectants were cultured in DMEM medium containing 1 µg/ml of puromycin.


  A plasmid vector of BRCA1 splice variant, in which absence of exon 9 and 10), was
  created by cloning the variant BRCA1 cDNA into the pcDNA3.1 expression vector using
  artificially engineered 5′ HindIII and 3′ XhoI sites. The BRCA1 cDNAs were contributed
  by Mien-Chie Hung. cDNA encoding the BRCA1 Delta(9,10) protein was subcloned into
  pCEP4 under the CMV promoter). This vector contains Tag2 which allows expression
  of the protein with an amino-terminal FLAG sequence.


  In order to obtain vector for wild type BRCA1 with full length expression, we amplified
  cDNA of exon 9–10 of BRCA1 from the mammary epithelium cells HBL-100, using forward
  primer and reverse primer. The specified cDNA region was then subcloned into pCEP4-BRCA1
  Delta(9,10) at the 5′ SphI and 3′ BbvCI sites.






  The nonsense mutation BRCA1-3300delA vectors were created by modification of pCEP4-BRCA1
  full length plasmid. In brief, amplification with twelve PCR cycles was performed
  using platinum Taq DNA polymerase and 10 µM of oligonucleotide primers. One µl of
  Dpn I restriction enzyme was added directly to each PCR reaction. Each reaction
  mixture was gently mixed by up and down pipetting then spinned down in for 1 minute
  and each reaction was immediately incubated at 37°C for 1 hour to digest the parental
  supercoiled dsDNA. The PCR product was purified and transformed in E.coli. After
  then, the cells were plated on ampicillin LB agar plate containing X-gal and incubated
  for 16 hours at 37°C. White clones were recovered and re-streaked on master plates.
  Cells containing the plasmid with mutated BRCA1 inserts generated the white clones,
  from which the DNA was then extracted and sequenced. BRCA1 3300delA plasmids were
  stably transfected into the BRCA1-defective breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-436.




  The expression vector containing missense mutation BRCA1 was created by modification
  of the pCEP4-BRCA1 plasmid as a template and the mutagenesis was carried out in
  the same procedure as above, using the following PCR primers; Tyr856His; forward
  primer 5′-TCA GCA TTT GCA GAA TAC ATT CAA GGT -3′, reverse primer 5′- GCT TTG AAA
  CCT TGA ATG TAT TCT GC -3′. The resulting mutant plasmids containing BRCA1 were
  stably transfected into MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells harboring endogenous wild type
  BRCA1.


  The transfected cells were studied for their cellular capability of proliferation,
  migration, invasion and anchorage-independent growth. For confirming BRCA1 sequence,
  the GenBank accession number U14680 was used as the reference database.




  The CellTiter 96® AQueous Non-Radioactive Cell Proliferation Assay is a colorimetric
  method for determining the number of viable cells in proliferation as well as chemosensitivity
  assays. This assay is composed of solutions containing a tetrazolium compound  and
  an electron coupling reagent. MTS is bioreduced by cells into a formazan product
  that is soluble in tissue culture medium. This MTS assay was performed using a CellTiter96TMA
  Queous Assay kit, according to the manufacturers instructions. Briefly, 1×105 cells
  were seeded into each well of 96-well culture plates and incubated at 37°C in CO2
  incubator for 24 h. The medium was then replenished with medium in the absence or
  presence of cucurbitacin B. Cells were then incubated at 37°C in CO2 incubator for
  24 h, 48 h, 72 h and 96 h. The cells were then rinsed with plain DMEM medium followed
  by adding CellTiter96™ Aqueous One Solution Reagent to the culture wells. The absorbance
  at 490 nm was then recorded using a Multiskan Specturm. The tested results represent
  the mean and standard error of three experiments.




  The trypan blue dye exclusion test was determined for the cytotoxic response to
  paclitaxel . Cells were seeded at a density of 1×105 cells/well in 24-well plates
  and incubated overnight in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator. The cells were then either
  treated with 4 µM paclitaxel or with various concentrations of cucurbitacin B. After
  48 h of continuous drug exposure, cells were detached by trypsinization and the
  number of viable cells were determined using a Beckman Coulter Vi-cellTM XR cell
  viability automated cell counting analyzer. Cytotoxic responses to the drugs were
  expressed as the percent of cells killed as compared with the control cells. Triplicate
  determinations were performed in each experiment and the results represent the mean
  and standard error of three experiments.




  Soft agar colony formation assays were performed in 60 mm culture dishes as described
  previously . Briefly, cells were suspended in 1.5 ml of 0.3% agar in complete growth
  medium containing DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS in the absence or presence of cucurbitacin
  B. The cell suspension was then added to a base layer of 0.6% agar containing medium
  and incubated at 37°C in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator for 2 weeks. Colonies were
  stained by adding 500 µl of 2 mg/ml P-iodonitrotetrazolium violet to the culture
  dishes. The dishes were then incubated at 37°C for 24 hours. Stained colonies were
  manually counted under a magnifying lens. The number of colonies presented from
  each phenotype represents the mean and standard error of triplicate determinations.




  These assays were performed as described previously . In vitro cell migration assay
  was performed using Transwell chambers with 8 µl pore size. Actively growing cells
  of approximately 70% confluence in culture flasks were allowed to adapt in serum-free
  medium for 24 h. These cells were then detached by trypsinization, washed with PBS
  and re-suspended in serum-free culture medium in the absence or presence of cucurbitacin
  B. Total volume of 100 µl cell suspension was added to each upper chamber and the
  serum containing culture medium was added to the bottom chambers. The cells were
  then incubated for 24 h at 37°C. Cells that had migrated into the bottom chambers
  were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS and the number of cells was counted under
  a phase contrast microscope. Triplicate determinations were performed in each experiment.
  Invasion assays were performed in a similar manner, using Matrigel-coated membrane
  inserted between the two chambers.




  Cells were seeded into 6-well plates and treated with 15 µg/ml cucurbitacin B for
  48 h. The cells were prepared for western blotting as previously described , . Briefly,
  cell lysates were prepared in the solution containing lysis buffer . Protein concentrations
  were determined by the Bio-Rad dye-binding assay. Cellular proteins were fractionated
  by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane
  was blocked and immunostained with primary antibodies. Anti-BRCA1, anti-p21/Waf1/cip1,
  anti-p27 or anti-human survivin antibodies were used as primary antibodies. Horseradish
  peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies in conjunction with chemiluminescence
  detection in the FUJIFILM LAS-3000 system were used to visualize the binding of
  specific primary antibodies to immobilized proteins. Quantitative analysis of protein
  expression was performed using a Multi-Gauge Image software installed in the FUJIFILM
  LAS-3000 system. Changes in protein expression were calculated by comparison to
  the control. The numbers on the blots represent relative values of protein expression
  levels as compared to the control. GAPDH expression  was used as internal control.




  Statistically difference between the two groups was assessed using students t-test.
  P value of less than 0.01 was considered as significant different. The percentage
  of cells inhibition after cucurbitacin B treatment was calculated by the following
  formula:






  We determined the roles of BRCA1 as a factor that might influence the action of
  cucurbitacin B on cell proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, cell migration
  and invasion. Loss or reduced BRCA1 expression could lead to a significant increase
  in cellular proliferation. The wt-BRCA1 breast cancer cells were transfected with
  shRNAs targeting to BRCA1. The BRCA1 protein was significantly reduced in cells
  stably transfected with the shRNA-BRCA1 plasmid but not in the cells transfected
  with the control vector. The IC50 of cucurbitacin B in the parental MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231
  cells, their shRNA-BRCA1 transfected cells and vector control cells were analyzed.
  Each group of cells were incubated with specified concentrations of cucurbitacin
  B, ranging from 1 to 100 µg/ml and the cells were assessed for their viability using
  MTS assay at 48 h post incubation. The growth inhibitory effect of cucurbitacin
  B was shown in Figure 1C. Table 1 details the IC50 of cucurbitacin B in each group.
  It is obvious that the growth of knocked-down BRCA1 cells were inhibited by cucurbitacin
  B more than the parental and scrambled control cells. A significant decrease in
  cell viability of knocked-down BRCA1 cells after treating with 20 µg/ml cucurbitacin
  B is shown in Figure 1D.






  Figure 1.  Cell viability of cucurbitacin B treated BRCA1 knocked-down breast cancer
  cells.


  (A) and, BRCA1 expressions were knocked down in MCF-7 cells and MDA-MB-231 cells,
  respectively. Lanes 1 and 2, parental and transfected control cells. Lanes 3, shRNA-BRCA1
  transfected cells. GAPDH expression represents internal control. All the densitometric
  values were normalized to loading controls, and the fold change relative to the
  parental control are indicated numerically above the blots., Cells were treated
  with 1, 10, 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 µg/ml cucurbitacin B for 48 h. Three repetitive
  experiments were done and each was run in triplicate., The results from the experiment
  shown in are compared in each group at the specified concentration of 20 µg/ml cucurbitacin
  B. Knocked-down BRCA1 breast cancer cells showed significant higher sensitivity
  to cucurbitacin B when compared to the parental cells,.







  Table 1.  The half maximal inhibitory concentration in each group of breast cancer
  cells.



  We further examined the proliferative rate in each group of cells after treated
  with 12 µg/ml of cucurbitacin B. The differences in the rate of proliferation were
  obviously seen as early as 24 hours, and the differences were further increased
  over a four-day culture period. Cucurbitacin B untreated controls of MCF-7 and MDA-MB231
  cells with BRCA1 functional loss proliferated approximately twice faster than the
  parental and shRNA scrambled counterparts having wild type BRCA1. Addition of cucurbitacin
  B into the culture medium effectively restrained growth of shRNA-BRCA1 cells. In
  Figure 2, the cell numbers counted from 24 h to 72 h indicated that cucurbitacin
  B treatment to these BRCA1 knocked down cancer cells could impede growth for approximately
  50 percent as compared to the fast growing, untreated BRCA1 knocked-down partner.
  Proliferation of cucurbitacin B treated parental cells and scrambled cells harboring
  the functional BRCA1 tumor suppressor was mildly reduced when compared to its paired
  untreated control cells. Molecules thought to be vulnerable by the effect of cucurbitacin
  B were addressed and details in the following results.






  Figure 2.  Cell proliferations of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 after treatment with 12 µg/ml
  cucurbitacin B into the culture medium in the parental cells, transfected control
  cells and shRNA-BRCA1 knocked-down cells.


  Each experiment was performed in triplicate. ShRNA-BRCA1 knocked-down cells showed
  significant highly sensitive to cucurbitacin B when compared to the BRCA1 parental
  cells,.



  Loss or reduced BRCA1 expression led to an increase in malignant behavior in terms
  of the propensity for anchorage-independent growth, cell migration and invasion
  of matrigel . Clonogenic assay relies on individual colony forming cell to proliferate
  in soft agar culture to form a colony. When breast cancer cells were cultured in
  soft agar either with or without cucurbitacin B, clonal growth of the BRCA1 knocked-down
  cells was inhibited significantly in the presence of cucurbitacin B compared with
  the untreated control cells. The clonal growth, as determined by the number of colonies
  formed in soft agar, was reduced by cucurbitacin B and decrease in the size of colonies
  was also observed in the cucurbitacin B treated culture. Cucurbitacin B significantly
  inhibited cellular migration and invasion in the shRNA-BRCA1 transfected cells but
  had no effect upon parental cells at concentration of 12 µg/ml. These results indicate
  that the biological action of cucurbitacin B in cancer cells could be associated
  with the BRCA1 function.

  respectively..





  Knocking down BRCA1 in breast cancer cells resulted in an increase in the expression
  of survivin which associated with malignant progression and drug resistance . In
  the absence of cucurbitacin B treatment, knocking down of BRCA1 expression could
  result in an increased anti-apoptotic molecule survivin expression with a concurrent
  reducdion of paclitaxel sensitivity. Treatment of the BRCA1 knocked-down cells with
  15 µg/ml cucurbitacin B could induce cell cycle inhibitors p27Kip1 and p21/Waf1
  expression but down modulate survivin expression. Reduced expression of survivin
  in these cucurbitacin B treated cells could be an important sign of increased apoptotic
  process, as a significant increased sensitivity to cucurbitacin B was observed.

  knocked-down counterparts and shRNA scrambled controls.


  (A) and, Western blot analysis for p21, p27 and survivin proteins after the cells
  were cultured either in control medium or in the medium containing 15 µg/ml cucurbitacin
  B for 48 h. GAPDH was used as loading control., The degrees of significantly cytotoxic
  responses to paclitaxel and cucurbitacin B in wt-BRCA1 parental and BRCA1 knocked-down
  MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells are shown,.





  The two BRCA1-defective breast cancer cells shown to express low BRCA1 compared
  to the wild type cells. Similar to the BRCA1 knocked-down cells mentioned earlier,
  cucurbitacin B could suppress the growth of the mutant cells. IC50 of the BRCA1
  mutant cells treated with cucurbitacin B is shown in Table 1. Under cucurbitacin
  B treatment, both mutant cell types possessed a magnificent lower growth rate with
  reduced cell viability in dose dependent manner. Significantly increased p27Kip1
  and p21/Waf1 and reduced survivin expressions in the treated mutant cells are shown.
  By comparison to the wt-BRCA1 breast cancer cells, the mutant cells HCC1937 and
  MDA-MB-436 expressed higher level of survivin with reduced sensitivity to paclitaxel,
  indicating as decreased % killed . In contrast, increased sensitivity to cucurbitacin
  B was clearly observed in BRCA1 deficit mutant cells. These results imply that paclitaxel
  treatment is more effective in the breast cancer cells harboring functional BRCA1
  while cucurbitacin B is suitable for the cancer cells with defective BRCA1.

  B for 48 h. and, Proliferative rate of the mutant BRCA1 cells after treated with
  15 µg/ml cucurbitacin B showed significantly decreased compared with untreated cells,.

  The cytotoxic responses of the wild type and the mutant cells to paclitaxel and
  cucurbitacin B are shown.





  Stably transfected cells expressing mutated BRCA1 and empty vector transfected control
  cells were isolated after selection with hygromycin. The expressions of the transfected
  mutated BRCA1 from MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were confirmed by RT-PCR analysis.
  In order to address whether the introduced BRCA1 would interfere with tumor suppressor
  function of wt-BRCA1 in the cells concerning to their cellular proliferation, we
  then compared the growth rates of breast cancer cells with BRCA1 induction with
  the parental wt-BRCA1 expressing cells. Figure 7A and 7B show the higher proliferative
  rate of the induced BRCA1 mutant cells than the solely wt-BRCA1 parental cells,
  and the differences were obviously seen as early as 24 hours of culture. The differences
  were further progressive over the four-day culture.






  Figure 7.  Expression of mutant BRCA1 after stably transfected in wild type MCF-7
  and MDA-MB-231 cells.


  (A) and, Cell proliferation of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 parental, empty vector transfected
  control and mutant BRCA1 transfected cells. Triplicate analysis was performed in
  each experiment and the values shown represent the mean and standard error of three
  experiments. Mutant BRCA1 transfected cells showed significantly higher proliferative
  rate compared with the parental cells,.



  The BRCA1-transfected mutant cells were also subjected for studying their malignant
  behaviors. However, the results did not show meaningful difference in these capabilities
  between the wt-BRCA1 parental cells and the induced BRCA1, implying that effect
  of the introduced BRCA1 point mutation gene into the endogenous wt-BRCA1 expressing
  cells is mild and not enough for influencing the behaviors other than proliferation.
  By this reason, the induced BRCA1 mutant cells thus did not appropriate for studying
  role of BRCA1 upon paclitaxel and cucurbitacin B treatments. Instead, we selected
  to study with more suitable BRCA1-defective breast cancer cells and shRNA knocked
  down as reported above.




  As shown in Figure 6, endogenous BRCA1 defective cancer cells exhibited higher sensitivity
  to cucurbitacin B than the wt-BRCA1 expressed cells. We further confirmed the role
  of BRCA1 on cucurbitacin B sensitivity using exogenous induced BRCA1 expression.
  Full length BRCA1 vector and the vector containing splice variant BRCA1 Delta(9,10)
  were stably transfected into BRCA1-defective breast cancer cell, MDA-MB-436. Both
  the full length BRCA1 and the splice variant encode for functional proteins. Western
  blots showed the high expression of BRCA1 as compared with empty vector control
  cells. Cells were then grown for 5 days and cell viability was measured. Both BRCA1
  full length and BRCA1 Delta(9,10) could inhibit cell growth when compared to the
  control cells. In order to test cytotoxicity of cucurbitacin B on BRCA1-defective
  parental and BRCA1-overexpressing cells, each of them were treated with 12 µg/ml
  cucurbitacin B for 48 hours. The cells having BRCA1 full length and BRCA1 Delta(9,10)
  were more resistant to cucurbitacin B treatment than the parental and control transfected
  cells.

  pCEP4 was used as empty vector control., Cells were grown for 5 days and cell viability
  was tested by using MTS assay., MDA-MB-436 parental cells, empty vector control
  cells and cells with transfected BRCA1 were treated with 12 µg/ml cucurbitacin B
  for 48 h and cell viability was analyzed. BRCA1 expressing cells showed significant
  higher resistance to cucurbitacin B when compared to the BRCA1 defective parental
  cells,.





  BRCA1 3300delA mutation associates with familial breast cancer in Thai patients
  . We constructed BRCA1(3300delA) by using BRCA1 full length as a template and both
  the BRCA1(3300delA) and the full length inserted vectors were stably transfected
  into BRCA1-defective breast cancer cells MDA-MB-436. BRCA1 expression was detected
  via Western blot analysis. The BRCA1(3300delA)-transfected cells produced truncated
  BRCA1 protein of 120 kDa while the full length coded for complete BRCA1 of 220 kDa.
  The empty vector pCEP4 was used for the transfection control. The growth rates of
  breast cancer cells stably transfected with wt-BRCA1 and the mutated 3300delA were
  analyzed. As compared with the empty vector control cell, the wt-BRCA1 inhibited
  cell growth while the BRCA1(3300delA) promoted cellular proliferation. Cells were
  then treated with either control medium or specified concentrations of cucurbitacin
  B for 48 hours and measured for cell viability. The resistance to cucurbitacin B
  was observed in the wt-BRCA1. The mutated BRCA1 expressing cells and BRCA1-defective
  parental MDA-MB-436 cells were equally killed at the concentration of 25 ug/ml.

  µg/ml cucurbitacin B for 48 h. Control cells were treated with 0.1% DMSO. The experiments
  were done in triplicate. The wild type but not mutant BRCA1 expressing breast cancer
  cells showed significant higher resistance to cucurbitacin B when compared to the
  parental cells,.





  Discovery of local medicinal plants provide an important source of the naturally
  derived new anticancer drug development including Taxol , . Cumulative evidences
  from previous reports showed that cucurbitacin B has anticancer activity in human
  cancer cells , . We previously reported that cucurbitacin B inhibits growth and
  telomerase activity in breast cancer cell lines. This agent exerts an obvious inhibitory
  effect in the estrogen receptor-negative SKBR-3 cells. Cucurbitacin B also inhibits
  hTERT and c-Myc expression, implying that it exerts an anticancer effect by inhibiting
  telomerase via down regulating both the hTERT and c-Myc expression in breast cancer
  cells . Other studies showed that different cucurbitacin species could also modify
  biological activities of cancer cells. For instance, cucurbitacin B/E glucosides
  can induce cell cycle arrest at G2/M as well as induce apoptosis in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231
  human breast cancer cells . Cucurbitacin I and Q were shown to specifically inhibit
  STAT3 phosphorylation which contributes to the proliferation of cancer cells .


  In this work, we elaborate the effects of cucurbitacin B on breast cancer cells.
  The anticancer bioactivities of cucurbitacin B on the four breast cancer cell lines
  were determined. Among the two cell lines with endogenous expression of wild type
  BRCA1, MCF-7 cells are ER positive whereas MDA-MB-231 cells are ER negative. The
  other two cell lines are endogenous mutant BRCA1 breast cancer cells. MDA-MB-436
  possessed 5396+1G&gt;A mutation in the splice donor site of exon 20 and has ER negative
  whereas HCC1937 has the insertion of a cytosine at position 5382 of BRCA1. This
  mutated type frequently observed in Ashkenazi Jewish. HCC1937 has also negative
  for ER, PR and Her2/neu .


  Invasion and metastasis are the major interest in the study on bioactivity of drug
  in cancer. These two cancer behaviors result in the failure of therapeutic intervention
  and death. Some report showed that cucurbitacin I can inhibit migration of keloid
  fibroblasts  and also reduces the invasiveness of nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell
  lines with elevate STAT3 activation . However, the biological effects of cucurbitacin
  compounds on migration and invasion of breast cancer cells and their possible mechanism
  have not been completely understood. The reduction of cells invasion and migration
  could partly due to inhibitory effect of cucurbitacin B on cell viability. The other
  mechanisms may also involve in the effect of cucurbitacin B on these processes.
  Recently, Duangmano et al.  reported that cucurbitacin B obviously interferes with
  the microtubule network, which could be one possible reason for the reduced migration
  and invasion upon cucurbitacin B treatment. We compared the effects of cucurbitacin
  B in BRCA1 knocked-down cells with the wild type BRCA1 harboring cells. The results
  indicated that cucurbitacin B inhibits cellular proliferation, migration, invasion
  and ability of anchorage-independent growth of the BRCA1 knocked-down breast cancer
  cells while this compound exerts a minimal effect on the wild type BRCA1 breast
  cancer cells. Results from BRCA1 mutant cells are similar to that of the BRCA1 knocked-down
  cells. To support these findings, the exogenous wild type BRCA1 was introduced into
  the BRCA1-defective breast cancer cells, MDA-MB-436. This extra wt-BRCA1 causes
  the cells to be cucurbitacin B resistant. Both of the BRCA1 full length and the
  splice variant BRCA1 Delta(9,10) induced the resistant effects. Some mutations of
  BRCA1 affected sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drug , . For example, the missense
  mutation D67Y BRCA1 RING domain was more susceptible to cisplatin than wild type
  BRCA1 RING domain protein . Our study showed BRCA1-transfected mutant cells interfered
  function of wild type BRCA1 by increased cellular proliferation. However, the BRCA1-transfected
  mutant cells did not show significant difference in cell migration, invasion and
  anchorage-independent growth assays. Then, we used the other mutations in order
  to evaluate cucurbitacin B effects. Cells harboring the BRCA1(3300delA) mutation
  showed highly proliferated phenomenon when compared with empty vector control. Treatment
  with cucurbitacin B can inhibit cellular proliferation of these mutant cells and
  the BRCA1-defective parental cells, suggesting that cucurbitacin B could be an effective
  anticancer agent properly used for BRCA1-defective breast cancer. Some report has
  shown that BRCA1 mutant breast cells are generally estrogen receptor negative –.
  Notably, the ERα expression in BRCA1 mutant cells HCC1937 is recovered when the
  exogenous wild type BRCA1 was introduced into these cells . Our recent works also
  demonstrated that ER-negative breast cancer cells are more senstive to cucurbitacin
  B than the ER-positive breast cancer cells , . The explanation of how BRCA1 mutant
  cells are more sensitive of to cucurbitacin B than the cells harboring wild type
  BRCA1 probably associates with the ER expression.


  From above information, we believe that the normal BRCA1 plays crucial roles in
  maintaining cellular homeostasis of the normal cells. The presence of tumor suppressor
  BRCA1 induces expression of ER  while the ER can subsequently induce c-Myc expression
  . The c-Myc upregulates telomerase and the cell proliferation increases ,  to keep
  balanced with anti-proliferative effect of BRCA1. Loss of BRCA1 could thereby lead
  to reduced ER and c-Myc expression into lower levels. Expression of c-Myc is also
  induced by β-catenin/TCF of the Wnt signaling –. Our recent report revealed that
  c-Myc and cyclin D1 were reduced upon cucurbitacin B treatment in wt-BRCA1 possessed,
  ER MCF-7 cells. The effect of this agent is more serious in the low BRCA1 expressing,
  ER SKBR-3 cells , . Cucurbitacin B is thought to inhibit the movement of β-catenin
  and galectin-3 to the nucleus, hence down-regulating their Wnt signaling targets
  such as c-Myc and cyclin D1. In present work, we clearly show that the breast cancer
  cells harboring various types of defective BRCA1 are more sensitive to cucurbitacin
  B than the wt-BRCA1 possessed cells. We suggest that increase sensitivity to cucurbitacin
  B in BRCA1 defective cells is due to more aggressive reduction of the c-Myc by both
  reduced ER expression ,  and effect of cucurbitacin B on β-catenin/TCF of the Wnt
  signaling, which finally reduced c-Myc and cyclin D1 , .


  Overexpression of survivin is associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer ,
  . Previous report has shown that BRCA1 is a negative regulator of survivin , and
  we found herein that survivin expression is upregulated in the BRCA1 knocked-down
  and mutant cells. We also show that cucurbitacin B could inhibit the expression
  of survivin and could induce expression of both p21/Waf1 and p27Kip1 in BRCA1 deficient
  cells. Anticancer effect by cucurbitacin B had been reported , . Thoennissen NH
  et al.  showed that cucurbitacin B was associated with inhibition of activated JAK2,
  STAT3 and STAT5 and increased level of p21Waf1 in human pancreatic cancer cells.
  While, Tannin-Spitz T et al.  reported treatment of breast cancer cells with cucurbitacin
  glucoside dephosphorylated PKB, and inhibited survivin. The simultaneous PKB inhibition
  and STAT3 inactivation is possibly responsible for the observed induction in p21/WAF1
  expression. PKB inhibition might also lead to reduction in survivin expression .
  We also believe that, at least in part, the PKB dephosphorylation is probably associated
  with p21/Waf1 and/or p27Kip1 expression which could be associated with reduced survivin
  level. Our data show that cucurbitacin B suppresses the ability of BRCA1 defective
  cells to grow and migrate which probably because of the decrease in survivin via
  PKB inhibition, suggesting that this agent has anti-metastatic potential against
  the cancer cells. Moreover, we believe that cucurbitacin B interferes with apoptosis
  and cell cycle control machineries since survivin was inhibited while p21/Waf1 and
  p27Kip1 were upregulated in the cancer cells with defective BRCA1. The treatment
  with cucurbitacin B is more effective in BRCA1 defective breast cancer cells than
  in the wild type BRCA1 breast cancer cells. Results from this work should be useful
  for the future selective treatment or personalized medicine of human breast cancer.
