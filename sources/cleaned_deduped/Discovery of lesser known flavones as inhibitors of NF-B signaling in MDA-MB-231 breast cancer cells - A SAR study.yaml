  Seventeen flavonoids with different substitutions were evaluated for inhibition
  of nuclear factor-ÎºB signaling in the invasive breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231.
  They were screened using an engineered MDA-MB-231 cell line reporting NF-ÎºB activation.
  The modulation of expression of two NF-ÎºB regulated genes involved in tumorigenesis,
  matrix metalloproteinase-9, and cyclooxygenase-2 were also analyzed in these cells.
  Among the compounds tested, all except gossypetin and quercetagetin inhibited the
  activation of NF-ÎºB, and the expression of MMP-9 and COX-2 to different degree.
  Methylated flavone, chrysoeriol, was found to be the most potent inhibitor of MMP-9
  and COX-2 expressions. The effect of chrysoeriol on cell proliferation, cell cycle,
  apoptosis and metastasis was analyzed by established methods. Chrysoeriol caused
  cell cycle arrest at G2/M and inhibited migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells.
  The structure-activity relations amongst the flavonoids as NF-ÎºB signaling inhibitors
  was studied. The study indicates differences between the actions of various flavonoids
  on NF-ÎºB activation and on the biological activities of breast cancer cells. Flavones
  in general, were more active than the corresponding flavonols.'
