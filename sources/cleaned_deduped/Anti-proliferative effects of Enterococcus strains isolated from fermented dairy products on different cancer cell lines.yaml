  Among the lactic acid bacteria, Enterococcus strains can be utilized as probiotic
  and preservative agents. Enterococcus strains from traditional Iranian dairy products
  were isolated, identified by sequencing 16s rDNA gene, and biologically characterized
  in this study. Primary assessments, including low pH and high bile salt tolerance
  tests and experiments on antagonistic activity against pathogens and antibiotic
  susceptibility, verified the probiotic property of strains. The secreted metabolites
  from the strains and Taxol, as an anti-cancer drug, were analyzed through MTT assay
  to investigate their cytotoxicity in different cancer and normal human cell lines.
  Results revealed the anticancer characteristics of the secreted metabolites of E.
  durans 39C against all cancer cell lines, similar to Taxol. The metabolites did
  not exhibit cell toxicity in the normal cell line. Fluorescent microscopy and flow
  cytometry confirmed that apoptosis is the main cytotoxic mechanism of E. durans
  39C secretion metabolites.'
