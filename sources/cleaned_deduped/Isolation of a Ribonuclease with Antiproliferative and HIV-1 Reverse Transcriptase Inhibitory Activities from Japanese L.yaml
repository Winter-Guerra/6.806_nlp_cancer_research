  Activities from Japanese L.md
text: "\n\nA ribonuclease, with a molecular mass of 22.5 kDa and an N-terminal sequence
  exhibiting resemblance to previously isolated buckwheat storage proteins and allergens,
  was isolated from Japanese large brown buckwheat seeds. The ribonuclease was purified
  using a simple protocol that comprised ion exchange chromatography on Q-Sepharose
  and DEAE-cellulose and gel filtration on Superdex 75. The ribonuclease exhibited
  low activity toward poly U, lower activity toward poly C, and very low activity
  toward poly A and poly G. The enzyme was activated upon exposure to 10 mM of Fe2+
  and Zn2+ ions but was inhibited by Ca2+, Mg2+, and Mn2+ ions at the same concentration.
  The optimum pH and optimum temperature for the enzyme were pH 9 and 60 C, respectively.
  It inhibited proliferation of HepG2 hepatoma and MCF 7 breast cancer cells, with
  an IC50 value of 79.2 and 63.8 M, respectively. It potently inhibited HIV-1 reverse
  transcriptase activity with an IC50 of 48 M. However, there were no antifungal and
  mitogenic activities.\n\nRibonucleases have been isolated from a diversity of organisms
  including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals. In mammals, ribonuclease is distributed
  in various organs comprising the brain, liver, kidney, and pancreas and in different
  secretions comprising semen and milk. The enzyme displays multiple activities such
  as antiviral, anti-HIV reverse transcriptase, antifungal, and antitumor  activities.
  Plant ribonucleases play an important role in fundamental physiological processes
  including senescence, phosphate starvation response, and cell death pathways.\n\nIn
  view of the fact that different ribonucleases have distinct amino acid sequences
  and that many of the ribonuscleases reported in the literature were not assayed
  for biological activities other than ribonucleolytic activity, we undertook the
  present study to isolate a ribonuclease from Japanese large brown buckwheat seeds.
  It was assayed for different biological activities, including antiproliferative
  activity toward HepG2 hepatoma cells and MCF 7 breast cancer cells, mitogenic activity
  toward mouse splenocytes, antifungal activity, and inhibitory activity toward HIV-1
  reverse transcriptase.\n\nJapanese large brown buckwheat seeds  were purchased from
  a Japanese vendor and homogenized in distilled water using a blender. The homogenate
  was centrifuged at 10,000g for 30 min at 4 C. TrisHCl buffer  was added to the resulting
  supernatant until the concentration of Tris attained 10 mM. The supernatant was
  then chromatographed on a 5 cm  20 cm column of Q-Sepharose  in 10 mM TrisHCl buffer
  \ with a flow rate of 4.1 ml/min. After the flowthrough fraction Q1 had been removed,
  the column was eluted stepwise with 0.2 M NaCl, 0.5 M NaCl, and then with 1 M NaCl
  added to the starting buffer. The fraction  eluted with 0.5 M NaCl in the starting
  buffer was dialyzed against 10 mM NH4HCO3 buffer  at 4 C overnight before chromatography
  on a 2.5 cm  20 cm column of DEAE-cellulose  in the same buffer. After the flowthrough
  fraction  had been eluted, the column was eluted with a linear 01 M NaCl gradient
  in 10 mM NH4HCO3 buffer  with a flow rate of 3.3 ml/min. Fraction D1 was then dialyzed,
  lyophilized, and subjected to gel filtration on a Superdex 75 HR 10/30 column  in
  20 mM NH4HCO3 buffer  with a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min using an AKTA Purifier. The
  first fraction represented purified ribonuclease.\n\nSodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide
  gel electrophoresis  was carried out in accordance with the procedure of Laemmli
  and Favre, using a 12 % resolving gel and a 5 % stacking gel. At the end of electrophoresis,
  the gel was stained with Coomassie brilliant blue. FPLC-gel filtration was carried
  out using a Superdex 75 HR 10/30 column that had been calibrated with molecular-mass
  standards.\n\nAmino acid sequence analysis was carried out using an HP G1000A Edman
  degradation unit and an HP1000 HPLC system.\n\nThe activity of purified ribonuclease
  toward yeast tRNA  was assayed by determining the generation of acid-soluble, UV-absorbing
  species with the method of Wang and Ng. The RNase was incubated with 200 g tRNA
  in 150 l of 100 mM MES buffer  at 37 C for 1 h. The reaction was terminated by introduction
  of 25 l of ice-cold 3.4 % perchloric acid. After leaving on ice for 15 min, the
  sample was centrifuged  at 4 C. The OD260 of the supernatant was read after appropriate
  dilution. One unit of enzymatic activity is defined as the amount of enzyme that
  brings about an increase in OD260 of one per minute in the acid-soluble fraction
  per milliliter of reaction mixture under the specified conditions. Effects of pH
  and temperature on ribonuclease activity were tested as described in Xia et al..\n\nThe
  ribonucleolytic activity of purified ribonuclease toward polyhomoribonucleotides
  was determined with a modification of the method of Wang and Ng. Incubation of RNase
  with 100 g of poly A, poly C, poly G, or poly U in 250 l of 100 mM sodium acetate
  buffer  was carried out at 37 C for 1 h, prior to addition of 250 l of ice-cold
  1.2 N perchloric acid containing 20 mM lanthanum nitrate to terminate the reaction.
  After standing on ice for 15 min, the sample was centrifuged at 15,000g for 15 min
  at 4 C. The absorbance of the supernatant, after appropriate dilution, was read
  at 260 nm  or at 280 nm.\n\nThis assay was carried out with the approval of the
  Animal Research Ethics Committee, The Chinese University of Hong Kong. It was conducted
  since it has previously been reported that some ribonucleases exhibit activity toward
  mouse splenocytes. Four C57BL/6 mice  were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and
  the spleens were aseptically removed. Splenocytes were isolated by pressing the
  tissue through a sterilized 100-mesh stainless steel sieve and resuspended to 5
  \ 106 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 culture medium supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum,
  100 U penicillin/ml, and 100 g streptomycin/ml. The splenocytes  were seeded into
  a 96-well culture plate, and serial concentrations of the ribonuclease in 100-l
  medium were added. Following incubation of the splenocytes at 37 C in a humidified
  atmosphere of 5 % CO2 in the presence or absence of the purified ribonuclease for
  24 h, 10 l methyl -thymidine  was added, and the splenocytes were incubated for
  another 6 h under the same conditions. The splenocytes were then harvested with
  an automated cell harvester onto a glass fiber filter, and the radioactivity was
  measured with a Beckman model LS 6000SC scintillation counter. All reported values
  are the means of triplicate samples.\n\nThis assay was performed since it has been
  reported that some ribonucleases manifest this activity. The antiproliferative activity
  of the purified RNase was determined as follows. MCF7  and HepG2  cells were cultured
  in RPMI medium supplemented with 10 %  fetal bovine serum, 100 mg/l streptomycin,
  and 100 U/ml penicillin at 37 C and in a humidified atmosphere of 5 %  CO2. Cells
  were subsequently seeded into 96-well plates with a density of 2  103 cells/well
  and incubated for 24 h. Different concentrations of the RNase in 100 l complete
  RPMI medium were then added to the wells and incubated for 72 h. After that, -2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
  bromide]  quantification assays were carried out to measure viability of the cells.
  Briefly, 20 l of a 5 mg/ml MTT in phosphate-buffered saline was spiked into each
  well, and the plates were incubated for 4 h. The plates were then centrifuged at
  2,500 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant was carefully removed, and 150 l of dimethyl
  sulfoxide was added in each well to dissolve the MTT formazan formed at the bottom
  of the wells. After 10 min, absorbance at 590 nm was measured with a microplate
  reader. As a control, PBS instead of RNase was added into the wells.\n\nThis assay
  was executed out since it has previously been reported that some ribonucleases display
  this activity. The assay for ability to inhibit HIV-1 reverse transcriptase was
  carried out by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit from Boehringer Mannheim
  \ as described by Xia et al..\n\nThis assay  was performed since it has previously
  been reported that some ribonucleases demonstrate this activity. The fungal species
  tested were Fusarium oxysporum, Helminthosporium maydis, and Mycosphaerella arachidicola.\n\nWhen
  the crude extract of Japanese brown buckwheat seeds was fractionated on Q-Sepharose,
  ribonuclease activity resided in the second adsorbed fraction Q2. Ion exchange chromatography
  of Q2 on DEAE-cellulose yielded two adsorbed fractions, D1 and D2. Ribonuclease
  activity was present mainly in fraction D1. Ribonuclease activity was observed in
  the first peak S1  when fraction D1 was chromatographed on Superdex 75. It constituted
  purified ribonuclease.\n\na Ion exchange chromatography of crude extract of Japanese

  by gel filtration was 22 kDa. There was an approximately 10-fold increase in specific
  activity. In SDS-PAGE, it displayed a single band with a molecular mass of 22.5
  kDa.\n\nThe N-terminal sequence of buckwheat RNase resembled a partial sequence
  at some distance away from the C-terminus of the legumin-like protein   and allergenic
  protein   which are much larger in size than buckwheat RNase. However, it was similar
  in size as well as N-terminal sequence to allergenic protein   and storage protein.\n\nN-terminal

  residues indicate identical residues  \n\nRNases from barley, maize, Ricinus communis,
  and Zinnia elegans resembled one another in N-terminal sequence and molecular size.
  However, they showed only slight similarity  to buckwheat RNase.\n\nIts activity
  toward yeast tRNA revealed a steady increase when the pH was varied from 2 to 9,
  and an abrupt decline when the pH was further elevated above 9. Optimal activity
  was found at 60 C, and the activity was relatively stable until 66 C. The purified
  RNase exhibited ribonucleolytic activity toward poly U, poly G, poly A, and poly
  C: 86.6, 37.2, 21.4, and 0.2 U/ mg, respectively. The activity of the ribonuclease
  was stimulated by 10 M Fe2+ and 10 M Zn2+ ions but inhibited in the presence of
  a variety of other divalent cations at micromole concentrations including Ca2+,
  Mg2+, and Mn2+ ions.\n\nThe ribonuclease was devoid of mitogenic activity toward
  mouse spleen cells and antifungal activity. It inhibited the activity of HIV-1 reverse
  transcriptase and the proliferation of hepatoma HepG2 cells and breast cancer MCF7
  cells with IC50 values of 48 M  and 79.2 and 63.8 M, respectively.\n\na HIV-1 reverse

  invading foreign pathogens. In fact, some ribonucleases have antifungal activity.
  Some antifungal proteins such as thaumatin-like proteins  and chitinases  are allergens.
  It is noteworthy that the buckwheat RNase isolated in the present study resembles
  some allergens and storage proteins  previously reported from buckwheat in N-terminal
  amino acid sequence. It has been shown that other seed proteins such as antifungal
  proteins  and trypsin inhibitors  may also be allergens. Hence, it is possible that
  some RNases may also manifest allergenic activity. A gene FAO2 encoding legumin-like
  proteins and expressed during seed development in buckwheat is identical to the
  N-terminal amino acid domain of BW 24 kD, a major buckwheat allergen. However, there
  are other allergenic proteins from buckwheat such as trypsin inhibitors  which are
  different in sequence from the aforementioned buckwheat RNase and allergenic proteins.\n\nBufe
  et al.  have demonstrated that the major allergen from timothy grass pollen, Phlp5b,
  is a single-stranded, sugar-nonspecific nuclease with topoisomerase activity. Whether
  the enzymatic activity is responsible for induction of the allergic sensitization
  and inflammation remains uncertain. Thus, it seems likely that buckwheat RNase is
  also an allergen.\n\nThe RNase activity of barley nuclease is higher toward purine
  ribonucleotides than pyrimidine ribonucleotides, and the ranking of potency toward
  polyhomoribonucleotides is poly C &gt; poly U &gt; poly A &gt; poly G. Tobacco  RNase
  shows preference for poly G. Lentil seedling RNase shows the following ranking of
  potencies toward polyhomoribonucleotides: poly U &gt; poly A &gt; poly C &gt; poly
  G. Endonuclease from Agropyron elongatum seedlings shows the following ranking of
  potencies toward polyhomoribonucleotides: poly U &gt; poly A &gt; poly G &gt; polyC.
  Buckwheat RNase shows similarity in polyhomoribonucleotide specificity  to barley
  RNase.\n\nThe activity of buckwheat RNase is stimulated by Zn2+ ions. On the other
  hand, Pleurotus sajor-caju RNase is inhibited by Zn2+ ions. Buckwheat RNase  is
  slightly smaller in molecular mass than the 26 kDa. Antirrbinum RNase  has a much
  smaller size than the 33-kDa barley RNase  and the 35-kDa pea RNase.\n\nThe amphibian
  RNase onconase promotes activation-induced apoptosis of lymphocytes and thus may
  be clinically useful as an immunomodulating agent to suppress transplant rejection
  or treat autoimmune diseases. Angiogenin, one of the ribonucleases in milk, modulates
  the mitogenic response of nonimmune cells including bovine adrenal capillary endothelial,
  rat aortic smooth muscle, and fibroblast  cells. In contrast to the RNase from Pleurotus
  sajor-caju which exhibits antimitogenic activity toward splenocytes, buckwheat RNase
  lacks mitogenic activity. RNase from brown oyster mushroom is also devoid of mitogenic
  activity.\n\nBovine seminal and pancreatic RNases demonstrate antitumor activity.
  Onconase and amphinase from leopard frog Rana pipiens also exhibit antitumor activity.
  Mung bean  sprout nuclease shows antitumor and aspermatogenic activities. RNase
  from the mushroom Pleurotus sajor-caju exerts antiproliferative activities toward
  hepatoma HepG2 cells and leukemia L1210 cells with an IC50 of 0.22 and 0.1 M, respectively.
  RNases from the mushrooms Agrocybe cylindracea, Hypsizigus marmoreus, Russula delica,
  Lyophyllum shimeiji, Pleurotus djamor, Lactarius flavidulus, Tuber indicum, and
  Hohenbuehelia serotina  also demonstrate antiproliferative activity against tumor
  cells including leukemia, lymphoma, breast cancer, and hepatoma cells. Most of the
  plant ribonucleases have not been tested for antitumor activity. However, bitter
  gourd RNases display antitumor activity against HepG 2 and MCF 7 cancer cells in
  vitro as well as in vivo. Likewise, buckwheat RNase manifests antiproliferative
  activity on HepG 2 and MCF 7 cancer cells.\n\nRibonucleases from Chinese ginseng
  Panax ginseng, American ginseng Panax quinquefolium, milk  and mushrooms Ramaria
  formosa, Hohenbuehelia serotina, and Hygrophorus russula  exhibit HIV-1 reverse
  transcriptase inhibitory activity; Buckwheat RNase also inhibits HIV-1 reverse transcriptase.
  The mechanism probably involves proteinprotein interactions as in the case of inhibition
  of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase by HIV-1 protease  and inhibition of HIV-1 protease
  by cathelicidin fragments.\n\nRNases from tomato, hop, Arabis brassica, and wheat
  leaves  manifest anticancer activity. Nevertheless, the bulk of plant ribonucleases
  isolated earlier, e.g., RNases from Chinese ginseng  and American ginseng  have
  not been assayed for antiproliferative activity toward tumor cells. Only some e.g.
  RNases from Chinese ginseng  and American ginseng  have been assayed for HIV-1 reverse
  transcriptase inhibitory activity. Buckwheat RNase exhibits both types of activities.
  It has a molecular mass similar to that of bitter gourd RNase.\n\nRice pathogen-related
  protein 10  is a ribonuclease and is induced by biotic and abiotic stresses. The
  PR-10 proteins exhibiting RNase activity encompass those from birch pollen, white
  lupin, cotton, and pepper. Buckwheat RNase is an antipathogenic protein by virtue
  of its antitumor and anti-HIV reverse transcriptase activities.\n\nIn summary, an
  RNase with potentially exploitable activities, including antiproliferative and anti-HIV
  reverse transcriptase activities, has been isolated from Japanese large buckwheat
  seeds.\n"
