  analogs of trypsin inhibitors SFTI-1 that were fluorescent labeled on their N-terminal
  amino groups. Two fluorescent derivatives of benzoxazole were used as efficient
  fluorescent labels. The compounds obtained preserved their inhibitory activity and
  were efficient inhibitors of bovine trypsin or chymotrypsin. Nevertheless, their
  association inhibition constants were one or two orders of magnitude lower than
  those determined for unlabeled monocyclic SFTI-1 or SFTI-1, respectively. The conjugates
  obtained were found to be proteolytically stable in the presence of cognate enzymes.
  Applying such fluorescent peptides, we were able to investigate enzyme-inhibitor
  complex formation using fluorescent techniques. We found that such compounds were
  rapidly internalized by the fibroblast or cancer cells with no cytotoxic effects.
  2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Biopolymers 102: 124-135, 2014.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith only
  one exception, the canonical inhibitors that belong to the Bowman-Birk inhibitor
  family are polypeptides consisting of more than 60 amino acid residues. In 1999,
  Luckett et al. isolated a trypsin inhibitor SFTI-1 from sunflower seeds, and this
  was the smallest and in addition the most potent of all the inhibitors of the BBI
  family. SFTI-1 is a 14 amino acid circular peptide that was found to have high homology
  to the binding loop of other BBI family members. Its primary structure is shown
  in Figure 1. The reactive site P1-P1′ of the SFTI-1 inhibitor is located between
  the Lys5-Ser residues and therefore exhibits trypsin-like specificity, possessing
  a high affinity to trypsin. Owing to its exceptionally small size, compact structure,
  and high inhibitory activity, SFTI-1 is considered to be a very attractive template
  for designing proteinase inhibitors against physiologically important enzymes, which
  could be potentially used as pharmacological agents. Results of extensive studies
  on SFTI-1 are summarized in review papers.\n\n\n\nIn the mid 1990s, it was shown
  that short positively charged peptides were able to cross cell membranes. Since
  then, many examples of such cell penetrating peptides have been reported. Among
  them are peptides derived from proteins, synthetic chimeras and also those with
  non-naturally accruing primary structures. CPPs have attracted significant attention
  due to their ability to deliver cargos, including biologically active agents with
  different chemical characteristics into the cell. Such bioconjugates have therapeutic
  or diagnostic agent potentials, which are difficult to overestimate. Another group
  of peptides extensively studied in last two decades are cyclotides. These plant-derived
  miniproteins with a cysteine knot arrangement of three conserved disulfide bonds
  and head-to-tail cyclization are, unlike most peptides, exceptionally resistant
  to thermal/chemical denaturation, and enzymatic degradation. They possess numerous
  biological activities, including antimicrobial, antitumor, and anti-HIV. As part
  of the plant defense system, some of them display toxic effects and insecticidal
  activity. Recently, it has been shown, using confocal fluorescence microscopy imaging,
  that cycliotides are able to internalize into the breast cancer cell line, MCF-7,
  the macrophage cell line, RAW264.7 and HeLa cells. Interestingly, SFTI-1 also internalize
  into MCF-7 cells, although it does not interact with any of the investigated phospholipids.
  To monitor the cellular uptake, the peptides were labeled with fluorescence markers,
  biotin or AlexaFluor488, which were attached to the side-chain amino groups of Lys
  residues present in the studied peptides. In the case of trypsin inhibitors MCoTI
  and SFTI-1, Lys residues are located in substrate specific P1 position. Therefore,
  such labeled cyclic peptides lost their inhibitory activity. In the studies by Craiks
  and Camareros groups, the main goal was to obtain labeled peptides that would be
  able to cross the cell membranes and they did not focus their attention on the inhibitory
  activity of these cyclic peptides. We decided to design analogs of SFTI-1, which
  would combine both properties. Our intention was to obtain fluorescent analogs of
  SFTI-1 useful for monitoring inhibitor--proteinase complexes formed inside the cells.
  Such peptides would be a good starting point for the design of fluorescent inhibitors
  of physiologically important proteinases and they could be utilized to trace these
  enzymes in biological samples. As a lead structure, we selected monocyclic SFTI-1
  with only a disulfide bridge. In our earlier research we had proved that the elimination
  of head-to-tail cyclization in wild SFTI-1 did not significantly influence the inhibitory
  activity determined as the equilibrium association constant and proteolytic susceptibility.
  As fluorescent labels, we decided to use-l-alanine derivatives: 3--l-alanine-Box-Ala
  and previously unpublished 3--l-alanine-Box-Ala. A series of Box-Ala derivatives
  have recently been synthesized by the coauthors of this article. Because of their
  photophysical properties namely high quantum yields and excellent stability, these
  compounds can be useful as fluorescence probes. The chemical formulas of both fluorophores,
  together with their maximum wavelengths of excitation and emission are given in
  Figure 2. To preserve the inhibitory activity of synthesized SFTI-1 analogs, they
  were coupled through their carboxyl groups to the peptide N-termini. As reported
  previously such N-terminal modification did not influence potency of inhibitor.
  The primary structures of synthesized peptides are shown in Figure 3. In two fluorescent
  analogs, Phe residue was introduced in substrate specific P1 position. On the basis
  of our previous reports, this should change the specificity of synthesized peptides
  from trypsin to chymotrypsin inhibitory activity. To eliminate the possible trypsin
  cleavage site between Arg and Cys, this first amino acid residue was omitted in
  all synthesized SFTI-1 analogs. To determine the impact on the inhibitory activity
  of the fluorescent moieties attached to SFTI-1 analogs, two analogs 5 and 6 modified
  by PEG were also synthesized.\n\nFigure 2\\. Benzoxazole derivatives that were used
  as fluorescent labels with their extinction/emission wavelengths.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nN-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-3--l-alanine-Boc-Box-Ala
  was synthesized from N-Boc-protected 3-amino-l-tyrosine methyl ester, and N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-3--l-alanine-Boc-Box-Ala
  from N-Boc-protected 3-amino-l-tyrosine, via the intermediate Schiff base, which
  underwent oxidative cyclization to the heterocyclic compound in the presence of
  lead tetra-acetate in DMSO, according to the procedure published previously. This
  was followed by methyl ester saponification using 1N NaOH in methanol. 3-Nitro-l-tyrosine
  methyl ester, N-Boc-3-nitro-l-tyrosine methyl ester, and N-Boc-3-nitro-l-tyrosine
  were prepared according to literature procedures published in Refs.  and , respectively.\n\n\n\nAll
  protected amino acids were purchased from GLS CHINA, and AEA and ADEAethoxy) acetic
  acid) came from Iris Biotech GMBH, Germany. The Bovine α-chymotrypsin and β-trypsin,
  the chromogenic trypsin burst substrate-nitrophenyl-4′-guanidinobenzonate and ovomucoid
  from turkey egg whites were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The chromogenic turnover
  substrates: Nα-benzoyl-d,l-arginine 4-nitroanilide, Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-pNA, and
  Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Leu-pNA were purchased from Bachem, Switzerland, while Z-Phe-Ala-Thr-Tyr-ANB-NH2
  was synthesized according to Wysocka et al. All UV-VIS measurements were performed
  using a Cary 3E Spectrophotometer.\n\n\n\nAll the peptides were synthesized manually
  following the solid-phase method using Fmoc chemistry. The following amino acid
  derivatives were used: Fmoc-Gly, Fmoc-Cys(Trt), Fmoc-Thr(tBu), Fmoc-Ser(tBu), Fmoc-Lys(Boc),
  Fmoc-Ile, Fmoc-Pro, and Fmoc-Phe, Fmoc-Asp(OtBu). The protected derivative of C-terminal
  amino acid residue, Fmoc-Asp(OtBu), was attached to the 2-chlorotritylchloride resin
  in the presence of an equimolar amount of DIPEA under anhydrous conditions in DCM
  solution. Peptide chains were elongated in consecutive cycles of deprotection and
  coupling. Deprotection was performed with 20% piperidine in DMF/NMP with the addition
  of 1% Triton X-100, whereas chain elongation was achieved with standard DIC/HOBt
  chemistry; 3 equiv of protected amino acid derivatives were used. The same method
  was applied for coupling Fmoc-PEG derivatives and fluorescent compounds. After completing
  the syntheses, the peptides were cleaved from the resin simultaneously with the
  side chain deprotection groups in a one-step procedure, using a TFA/phenol/triisopropylsilane/H2O
  mixture. In the last step, the disulfide bridge was performed using a 0.1M methanolic
  iodine solution, following the procedure described elsewhere. The crude peptides
  were purified using HPLC on a Beckman Gold System with an RP Kromasil-100, C8, 5
  μm column. The solvent systems were 0.1% TFA and 80% acetonitrile in A. Either isocratic
  conditions or a linear gradient were applied. The purity of the synthesized peptides
  was checked on an RP Kromasil 100, C8, 5 μm column. The solvent system was as above.
  Linear gradient from 10 to 90% B for 30 min, flow rate 1 ml/min, monitored at 226
  nm. The mass spectrometry analysis was carried out on a MALDI MS using a-CCA matrix.\n\n\n\nThe
  bovine β-trypsin concentration was determined using spectrophotometric titration
  with 4-nitrophenyl-4′-guanidinobenzoate at an enzyme concentration oscillating around
  10−6 M. A standardized trypsin solution was used to titrate the ovomucoid from turkey
  egg whites, which in turn served to determine the solution concentration of the
  bovine α-chymotrypsin. The concentrations of the SFTI-1 analogs were determined
  via titration of their stock solutions with standardized bovine β-trypsin and bovine
  α-chymotrypsin with BAPNA and Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Leu-4-nitroanilide, respectively.
  The association constants were measured using the method developed in the laboratory
  of Empie and Laskowski. Enzyme-inhibitor interactions were determined in a 0.1M
  Tris-HCl buffer containing 20 mM CaCl2 and 0.005% Triton X-100 at room temperature.
  Increasing amounts of the inhibitor, varying from 0 to 2E0, were added to a fixed
  amount of the enzyme. After a 3 h of incubation, residual enzyme activity was measured
  using the turnover substrate. The measurements were carried out at initial enzyme
  concentrations over the ranges 1.3-9.1 nM for trypsin and chymotrypsin, respectively.
  The residual enzyme activity was measured with BAPNA and Z-Phe-Ala-Thr-Tyr-ANB-NH2
  \ as chromogenic substrates for trypsin and chymotrypsin, respectively. In all cases,
  the initial substrate concentration was below 0.1 KM. The experimental points were
  analyzed by plotting the residual enzyme concentration  versus the total inhibitor
  concentration . The experimental data were fitted to the theoretical values using
  the GRAFIT software package. A more detailed procedure was described in our recent
  article. The inhibitory activities, expressed as the Ka values with bovine β-trypsin
  or bovine α-chymotrypsin for the SFTI-1 analogs, are summarized in Table 1.  \n\n\n\n\nThe
  1.5 × 106 of cells, immortalized human fibroblast cell line and MCF-7 cell line
  were cultured at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere saturated with 5% CO2 in DMEM medium.
  Next cell were resuspended or cultured in 3 ml of DMEM and 5 µl of inhibitors 1-4
  at two different concentration 10 µM and 25 was added and mixed thoroughly. At the
  indicated time points, the 0.5 × 105 cells from each system were collected and washed
  3 times with DMEM medium supplemented with TRITON 0.2% and finally resuspended in
  100 mM PBS with 2% FBS and subjected for further studies.\n\n\n\nHarvested by trypsinization
  and counted cells were seeded on Millicell EZ Slide at a density of 5 × 104 cells/well
  and left to attach overnight. Next, the cells were treated with analogs at different
  concentrations, after aforementioned time points were washed twice using 100 mM
  PBS, fixed using Cytofix and immediately analyzed using Olympus IX81 equipped with
  Lumen Dynamics X-Cite Series 120 PC Q lamp module.\n\n\n\nBriefly, cell were harvested
  by trypsinization and counted. Next cell were seeded on 24-well plates at a density
  of 105 cells/well and left to attach overnight. Subsequent, the cells were treated
  with tested compounds at different concentrations or benzoxazole alanine derivates,
  washed twice with 100 mM DMEM medium with 2% FBS, harvested by trypsinization, and
  suspended in 100 mM PBS with 2% FBS. The flow cytometry analysis was performed immediately
  using BD LSRFortessa cytometer exploiting UV laser. Data analysis was conducted
  using FACSDiva software. Presented data represents two independent experiments performed
  in duplicate and shows the relative fluorescence increase ± SD. Histograms present
  the results of one representative experiment.\n\n\n\nThe inhibitors stock solutions
  at final concentration 1 × 10−4 M were used. Enzymes stock solution were 3 × 10−4
  M were used. For enzyme-inhibitor studies 20 µl of inhibitor and 10 µl of enzyme
  was mixed in the 0.1M Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, and incubated 20 min. Nonlabeled
  monocyclic SFTI-1 concentration was 1.6 × 10−3 M and 50 µl of such solution was
  added into above mixtures. The studies were performed by means of gel filtration
  chromatography on an HPLC with an FP2020 scanning fluorescence detector equipped
  with an Agilent Zorbax Bio Series, GF 250 column. As the eluent, a 0.1M solution
  of Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5 with flow rate 1 ml/min was used. The extinction/emission
  wavelengths were as follows: inhibitor 1 and 3 320 nm/400 nm inhibitor 2 and 4 380
  nm/460 nm.\n\n\n\nBoth fluorescent markers Box-Ala and Box-Ala were attached as
  N-protected Boc derivatives to the N-termini of synthesized peptides using the standard
  method utilized in solid-phase peptide synthesis. In our previous study, we reported
  that, in monocyclic SFTI-1 analogs, the peptide bond Arg2-Cys was cleaved upon incubation
  with trypsin; therefore, in order to prevent splitting of the fluorescent moiety
  in all the synthesized peptides, the Arg2 was removed. Such modification together
  with the introduction of a PEG linker at the N-termini of the synthesized peptides
  did not influence the inhibitory activity. Both reference compounds 5 and 6 appeared
  to be potent trypsin and chymotrypsin inhibitors, respectively. The determined Ka
  values were the same order of magnitude as patent monocyclic SFTI-1 and SFTI-1,
  respectively. All synthesized fluorescence labeled compounds was also efficient
  inhibitors of bovine trypsin and chymotrypsin. Introduction of a fluorescent benzoxazole
  moiety into trypsin inhibitors did not reduce their potency, since their association
  constants were in the same range as monocyclic SFTI-1. In the case of compounds
  1 and 2, a significant reduction of inhibition potency was observed, in relation
  to the parent compounds, SFTI-1 and 5.\n\nAll fluorescent peptides incubated with
  appropriate enzymes remained proteolytically stable for 24 h. Also, MS analysis
  indicated that no degradation is observed over this period.\n\nFigure 4\\. HPLC
  analysis of compounds 1-4 incubated with bovine β-trypsin in Tris-HCl pH 8.3. Two
  time points were used solid line-time 0 and dash line 24 h. UV detection was applied
  at 226 nm.\n\n\nBearing in mind the excellent proteolytic stability and efficient
  inhibition of cognate enzymes displayed by the obtained labeled inhibitors, we decided
  to monitor the protease-inhibitor complex using the chromatography technique. In
  this experiment, in order to form a complex, trypsin and inhibitor 4 were mixed
  in the appropriate buffer. An analysis was performed using an HPLC system equipped
  with a size exclusion column and the fluorescent intensity was followed. As presented
  in Figure 5A, inhibitor 4 itself has a retention time 9.24 min. After 15 min of
  incubation with bovine β-trypsin, a new peak with a retention time of 6.94 min,
  significantly different from the elution time of the inhibitor alone, appeared and
  this was recognized as a noncovalent enzyme-inhibitor complex. This peak was not
  visible in the chromatogram when trypsin was first incubated with peptide 4 and
  after 15 min nonlabeled monocyclic SFTI-1 was added to this mixture. A similar effect
  was observed in the case of a system where a trypsin-inhibitor 4 complex had previously
  formed and such a mixture was acidified to obtain pH 3. In this case, the peak with
  a retention time of 7.05 min was significantly reduced and one denoted a free inhibitor
  appeared. This is in close agreement with well-known data that for canonical inhibitors:
  the strength of their complexes with cognate enzymes decreases with decreases in
  the pH.\n\nFigure 5\\. Size exclusion chromatography: analog 4 analog 4 incubated
  with bovine β-trypsin in tris-HCl buffer pH 8.3, analog 4 incubated with bovine
  β-trypsin in tris-HCl buffer pH 7.5, and then acidified to pH 3. Analog 4 incubated
  with bovine β-trypsin in tris-HCl buffer pH 8.3 followed by with a 5M excess of
  monocyclic SFTI-1. The fluorescence detector was used with excitation wavelength
  at 320 nm and emission wavelength at 400 nm.\n\n\nLess apparent observation was
  made for a mixture of inhibitor 2 and bovine α-chymotrypsin. The retention time
  of inhibitor 2 is 7.53 min. As a result of the incubation of these two constituents
  in Tris HCl buffer at pH 7.5, multiple peaks were observed between 6.18 and 10.34
  min. Among them the most intense had a retention time of 6.59 min. Such results
  could be an effect of the heterogeneity of the enzyme solution because of self-degradation
  of chymotrypsin in solution. In the presence of a 5 M excess of SFTI-1 all of the
  aforementioned peaks disappeared and only one, with a retention time of 7.53, corresponding
  to inhibitor 2 was visible.\n\nFigure 6\\. Size exclusion chromatography: analog
  3, analog 3 incubated with bovine β-trypsin in tris-HCl buffer pH 8.3, analog 3
  incubated with bovine β-trypsin in tris-HCl buffer pH 8.3 with a 5M excess of monocyclic
  SFTI-1. The fluorescence detector was used with excitation wavelength at 320 nm
  and emission wavelength at 400 nm.\n\n\nPeptides 1 and 3 at the concentration of
  2.53 × 10−5 M and 2.56 × 10−5 M, respectively, were analyzed using the condition
  described above. Again, only fluorescent molecules were detected. When compared
  to peptides 2 and 4, a surprisingly short retention time, equal to 4.52 min, was
  recorded for both compounds. The difference between compound 1 and 2 is just a fluorophore
  labeling; thus, such a shift in retention times was not justified. The addition
  of either appropriate proteinases or pH change did not influence the retention time
  of the analyzed inhibitors. Repeating the analysis in 6M urea present in both sample
  and elution buffer changed the retention time for both compounds dramatically from
  5 to 9 min. This indicated that both compounds in separation conditions form aggregates
  and so were not utilized in further size exclusion experiments. It worth underlining
  that such an observation was not for compounds 2 and 4 in the presence of a denaturing
  agent.\n\nFigure 7\\. Size exclusion chromatography: analog 1 in tris-HCl buffer
  pH 7.5. Analog 1 incubated and analyzed in presence of 6M urea. The fluorescence
  detector was used with excitation wavelength at 380 nm and emission wavelength at
  460 nm.\n\n\nIncubation of compounds 1-4 with cancer cell lines or transformed fibroblast
  cell lines at micromolar concentrations, displayed a noncytotoxic effect over 24
  h. Incubation of all the obtained compounds results in their visible presence within
  the cells used. Each cell system was incubated with an appropriately labeled peptide
  in DMEM medium and extensively washed by PBS supplemented with Triton X-100. Similar
  results were obtained for all tested compounds.\n\nOn Figure 8 as the results of
  incubation of inhibitors 1-4 with MCF-7 cell line is presented. There is a clear
  presence of fluorescent compounds inside the cell that is localized outside the
  nucleus. Similar observations were recorded for other cell line tested see Figure
  1 Supporting Information.\n\nFigure 8\\. Transmitted light and fluorescent images
  and its overlays of MCF-7 cells incubated with compounds 1-4: Incubation time 60
  min and magnification ×400\\. Analog 1, Analog 2, Analog 3, and Analog 4. All compounds
  at concentration 10 µM.\n\n\nIncubation of aforementioned cell line with fluorophore
  moieties namely Box-Ala and Box-Ala at concentration 0.256 µM also results in their
  fast internalization within the cell cytoplasm. We observed no cytotoxic effect
  during duration of the experiment. We have reason to believe that excellent permeability
  of labeled inhibitors is due to presence of benzoxazole alanine derivates present
  on their N-termini.\n\nFurther flow cytometry analysis of cells used in a previous
  experiment indicates that the majority of the cells are stained and highly fluorescence
  as compared to cells that were not incubated with the labeled SFTI-1 analogs. Moreover,
  their fluorescence does not depend on the time of incubation or on temperature.
  Fluorescence intensity and the amount of stained cells remain at the same high level
  as compared to the negative nonstained control.\n\nFigure 9\\. Flow cytometry analysis
  of MCF-7 cell line: analog 1, analog 2, analog 3, analog 4. The excitation wavelength
  was λext = 355 nm and emission, λem = 450/50 nm. Two concentrations of tested compounds
  were used. Incubation time 60 min.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFluorescent Boc-Box-Ala and Box-Ala.
  were synthesized from N-Boc-protected 3-amino-l-tyrosine methyl ester using previously
  described procedures. The obtained peptide conjugates appeared to be strong inhibitors
  of cognate enzymes despite the attached fluorophores and the length of PEG derivates.
  Association constants of compounds 3 and 4 with bovine β-trypsin are in the same
  range. Such values are one range less than native SFTI-1, but similar to the inhibitor
  potency of the monocyclic inhibitor and even higher than that obtained for pegylated
  SFTI-1 analog. A similar situation is observed for their chymotrypsin counterparts,
  peptides 1 and 2, but a lower associated constant as compared to SFTI-1 and its
  pegylated analog was obtained. All compounds incubated with an appropriate enzyme
  remain proteolytically stable for 24 h and MS analysis indicates that no degradation
  is observed during this time. This is an interesting finding since, for the monocyclic
  SFTI-1 molecule, the peptide bond Lys5-Ser5 is slowly hydrolyzed until the equilibrium
  is reached between open and intact forms. We believe that such behavior is observed
  because of the presence of a bulky hydrophobic group at the N-terminal part of the
  inhibitor.\n\n\n\nAll four compounds, when incubated with MOLT-4 and fibroblast
  lines at micromolar concentration, displayed no cytotoxic effect over 24 h. It worth
  emphasizing that bezoxazole moieties display moderate to high cytotoxicity against
  various cell lines at millimolar concentration. However, when conjugated with SFTI-1
  such an effect is significantly reduced. Those compounds were found to be cell permeable
  at submicromolar concentration.\n\nAll peptide conjugates are efficiently internalized
  into the living cancer or healthy cells and judging on the fluorescent microscope
  picture they are mainly localized in the cytoplasmic fraction. Further flow cytometry
  analysis indicates that such cell permeability is dose dependent when concentrations
  from 3.14 µM to 31.4 nM of compounds are used. Presence of macropinocytotsis inhibitor
  did not influence such uptake. Temperature did not affect membrane crossing efficiency,
  which remains at similar levels for systems incubated at 4 and 37°C. All of above
  results suggest that this process is passive and not governed by the cell. These
  results do not correlate well with data provided by Cascales et al. for the aforementioned
  selected cyclic peptides, also referred to as cyclotides. In their study, they incubated
  three groups of fluorescent labeled cyclic peptides, the sequences of which were
  derived from leading structures: MCoTI-II, kalata B1, and SFTI-1. To all peptides,
  either biotin moiety or ε-amino groups of Lys were conjugated with Alexa 488 fluorophore.
  Incubation of the obtained fluorescent peptides with phospholipids and further with
  a transformed macrophage cell line and a breast cancer cell line indicates that
  MCoTI-II and kalata-B1 derived fluorescent peptides were internalized into the cell
  due to strong interaction with the phospholipids, as a model of the cell membrane.
  The authors postulated that such massive uptake of the studied fluorescent peptides
  is due to vesicle formation of the membrane bound peptides and its engulfment into
  the cell, called the macropinocytosis phenomenon. Such results were not observed
  in the case of Alexa-SFTI-1 conjugates that display no affinity for membrane mimicking
  phospholipids. A limited amount of labeled SFTI-1 was identified inside the cell
  but the mechanism of its presence is unknown.\n\nFigure 10\\. Time dependence cell
  permeability assay for compounds 1-4. The time points for time-dependent cell permeability
  assay were 5, 30, and 60 min. Additionally, two different temperatures 36 and 4°C
  were applied and incubated for 30 min. Peptide concentration 10 µM. Amiloride was
  used at concentration of 1.25 mM.\n\n\nFigure 11\\. Dose and time dependence cell
  permeability assay for compounds 1-4. The time points for time-dependent cell permeability
  assay were 5, 30, and 60 min. Additionally, two different temperatures 36 and 4°C
  were applied and incubated for 30 min. Concentration of the compounds is 0.273 µM.
  Amiloride was used at concentration of 1.25 mM.\n\n\nSuch a discrepancy between
  SFTI-1 ability to cross the cell membrane could be explained by the nature of the
  fluorophore used. Benzoxazole derivatives that were attached to the N-terminal of
  SFTI-1 and its analog SFTI-1 are much more hydrophobic than those fluorophores used
  in the Australian groups studies. Both benzoxazole derivates penetrate the cell
  in submicromolar concentration that is much lower than corresponding SFTI-1 conjugates.
  This indicates that nature of these large hydrophobic groups is the main factor,
  which enhances cell permeability of obtained compounds.\n\n\n\nHaving obtained fluorescent
  inhibitors of proteolytic enzymes, we decided to investigate if we could utilize
  their fluorescent properties and monitor the inhibitor-enzyme complex formation.
  We wanted to test if the obtained compounds could act as potential noncovalent activity-based
  probes. Since the inhibitor interacts only with native active proteins, this should
  be especially interesting in the context of following protease activity. Moreover,
  SFTI-1 molecules display inhibitory activity/properties against a cohort of trypsin-like
  proteases, including trypsin, matriptase, tryptase, and many more. The reporter
  molecules are able to produce a strong fluorescent signal detectable by simple UV
  irradiation. Additionally, it is widely known that, in the case of reversible proteinase-inhibitor
  complexes, post detection pH change yields strip off the inhibitor(s) yielding the
  recovery of pure proteinase. To investigate their ability to form and visualize
  enzyme inhibitor complexes, we decided to utilize gel filtration chromatography
  with fluorescence detection mode. As mentioned earlier, we were able to obtain a
  clear picture only for two SFTI-1 derivatives. Two other peptides formed aggregates
  under assay conditions and were not subjected to further studies. Incubation of
  peptides 2 or 4, both labeled with chymotrypsin or trypsin, respectively, result
  in the formation of a new signal corresponding to a noncovalent enzyme-inhibitor
  complex. Such a signal was reduced or diminished when nonlabeled SFTI-1 or its analog
  with chymotrypsin specific SFTI-1 was present in the solution. The same affect was
  observed in the case of alerting the pH of such mixture due to a disruption of the
  complex. Utilization of SFTI and its analogs was described by Pereira et al., showed
  that immobilized monocyclic SFTI-1 analogs modified in the P1 position on agarose
  gel. The covalent linkage was achieved by the reaction of an aldehyde moiety of
  an oxidized Ser residue, additionally attached at the peptide N-terminus, and a
  hydrazine group of agarose. It was demonstrated that these immobilized SFTI-1 analogs
  could serve as affinity probes for the isolation of serine proteinases with different
  specificities.\n\n\n\nFour noncytotoxic cell permeable SFTI-1 analogs conjugated
  with fluorogenic moieties of benzoxazoles were obtained. Introduction of N-terminal
  fluorogenic groups did not influence their interaction with cognate proteinases,
  but resulted in an increase in their proteolytic stability and cell permeability,
  when compared to the parent compounds. We believe that such conjugates could serve
  as reversible activity-based probes and could be utilized in the study of protease
  inhibitor interactions.\n\n\n\nAuthors would like to thank the Polish National Science
