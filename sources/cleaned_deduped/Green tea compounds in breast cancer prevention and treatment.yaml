  Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women. In recent years, many in vitro
  and in vivo studies indicate that green tea possesses anti-cancer effects. The epidemiological
  studies, however, have produced inconclusive results in humans. Likewise, results
  from animal models about the preventive or therapeutic effects of green tea components
  are inconclusive. The mechanisms by which green tea intake may influence the risk
  of breast cancer in humans remain elusive mechanisms by which green tea intake may
  influence. Here, we review recent studies of green tea polyphenols and their applications
  in the prevention and treatment of breast cancer. Furthermore, we discuss the effect
  of green tea components on breast cancer by reviewing epidemiological studies, animal
  model studies and clinical trials. At last, we discuss the mechanisms by which green
  tea components suppress the development and recurrence of breast cancer. A better
  understanding of the mechanisms will improve the utilization of green tea in breast
  cancer prevention and therapy and pave the way to novel prevention and treatment
  strategies for breast cancer. '
