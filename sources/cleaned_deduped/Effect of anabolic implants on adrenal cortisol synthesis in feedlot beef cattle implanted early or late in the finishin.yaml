text: '


  Implantation of anabolic steroids to increase growth rate in beef cattle impacts
  adrenal glucocorticoid production. The mechanism by which combination androgen and
  estrogen implants reduce cortisol biosynthesis in heifers is not clear. The objective
  of this study was to identify whether pituitary or adrenal gene expression and liver
  enzyme activity may contribute to altered serum cortisol concentrations in heifers
  receiving a combination implant. On d 0 of a 122-d finishing phase, 187 predominantly
  Angus heifers  approximately 14 months old were randomly assigned to one of three
  implant groups:  non-implanted control,  implanted at the beginning of the finishing
  phase  with a combination implant, and  implanted during the late stage of the finishing
  phase  with Revalor 200. At d 56, body weight  was greater  for the early implanted
  heifers  compared to 437 and 435  kg for control and late implanted heifers, respectively.
  Final BW  was similar between both implanted groups and heavier than non-implanted
  controls. Serum cortisol was similar among groups at d 0  however, by d 28 heifers
  receiving the combination implant had reduced  serum cortisol concentrations  compared
  to controls  and late  groups. On d 84 cortisol was similar  among implanted heifers
  and was less  than non-implanted heifers. Expression of pituitary and adrenal genes
  involved in glucocorticoid synthesis was evaluated at d 28/29 or 84/85; however,
  despite decreased serum cortisol in implanted heifers, no change in mRNA expression
  was demonstrated. Liver CYP3A enzyme activity at d 28/29 was decreased 59% in early
  implanted heifers compared to control heifers. Additionally, at d 84/85 AKR1C activity
  was greatest  in control heifers compared to both implanted groups. Data suggest
  that components of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis are influenced by exposure
  to exogenous hormones and this should be recognized when considering cortisol levels
  as a marker for stress response.'
