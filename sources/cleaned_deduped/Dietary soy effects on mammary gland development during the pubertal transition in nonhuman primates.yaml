  While epidemiologic studies suggest that soy intake early in life may reduce breast
  cancer risk, there are also concerns that exposure to soy isoflavones during childhood
  may alter pubertal development and hormonal profiles. Here, we assessed the effect
  of a high-soy diet on pubertal breast development, sex hormones, and growth in a
  nonhuman primate model. Pubertal female cynomolgus monkeys were randomized to receive
  a diet modeled on a typical North American diet with one of two protein sources
  for approximately 4.5 years:  casein/lactalbumin  or  soy protein isolate with a
  human equivalent dose of 120 mg/d isoflavones, which is comparable to approximately
  four servings of soy foods. Pubertal exposure to the SOY diet did not alter onset
  of menarche, indicators of growth and pubertal progression, or circulating estradiol
  and progesterone concentrations. Greater endometrial area was seen in the SOY group
  on the first of four postmenarchal ultrasound measurements. There was a subtle effect
  of diet on breast differentiation whereby the SOY group showed higher numbers of
  differentiated large-sized lobular units and a lower proportion with immature ducts
  following menarche. Numbers of small lobules and terminal end buds and mammary epithelial
  cell proliferation did not differ by diet. Expression of progesterone receptor was
  lower in immature lobules of soy-fed animals. Our findings suggest that consumption
  of soy starting before menarche may result in modest effects consistent with a more
  differentiated breast phenotype in adulthood. Cancer Prev Res; 6; 83242. 2013 AACR. '
