  Canola oil-based diets have been shown to reduce plasma cholesterol levels in comparison
  with diets containing higher levels of saturated fatty acids. Consumption of canola
  oil also influences biological functions that affect various other biomarkers of
  disease risk. Previous reviews have focused on the health effects of individual
  components of canola oil. Here, the objective is to address the health effects of
  intact canola oil, as this has immediate practical implications for consumers, nutritionists,
  and others deciding which oil to consume or recommend. A literature search was conducted
  to examine the effects of canola oil consumption on coronary heart disease, insulin
  sensitivity, lipid peroxidation, inflammation, energy metabolism, and cancer cell
  growth. Data reveal substantial reductions in total cholesterol and low-density
  lipoprotein cholesterol, as well as other positive actions, including increased
  tocopherol levels and improved insulin sensitivity, compared with consumption of
  other dietary fat sources. In summary, growing scientific evidence supports the
  use of canola oil, beyond its beneficial actions on circulating lipid levels, as
  a health-promoting component of the diet.'
