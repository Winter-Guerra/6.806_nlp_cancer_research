text: '


  Resveratrol, a polyphenolic compound found in grapes, has been shown to partially
  exert its anti-cancer function through the modulation of epigenetic events. However,
  the epigenetic targets of resveratrol in breast cancer are not yet fully understood.
  Here, we identified that the gene encoding the histone H2B ubiquitin ligase RNF20,
  a chromatin modifying enzyme and putative tumour suppressor, is up-regulated by
  resveratrol in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Up-regulation of RNF20 is achieved
  through an increase of active histone marks around its promoter. The increase in
  RNF20 in MDA-MB-231 likely contributes to p21 regulation and the anti-growth effects
  of resveratrol, as RNF20 knockdown diminished these effects. Our findings suggest
  that RNF20 is a novel epigenetic target of resveratrol, and increase our understanding
  of how it contributes to the chemopreventive effect of resveratrol in a more aggressive
  breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231.'
