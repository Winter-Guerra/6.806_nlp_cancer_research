  Chrysin, a naturally occurring flavone, abundantly found in numerous plant extracts
  including propolis and in honey is one of the most widely used herbal medicine in
  Asian countries. Nowadays, chrysin has become the foremost candidate exhibiting
  health benefits, owing to its multiple bioactivities such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory,
  anti-allergic, anti-diabetic, anti-estrogenic, antibacterial and antitumor activities.
  Anticancer activity is most promising among the multiple pharmacological effects
  displayed by chrysin. In vitro and in vivo models have shown that chrysin inhibits
  cancer growth through induction of apoptosis, alteration of cell cycle and inhibition
  of angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis without causing any toxicity and undesirable
  side effects to normal cells. Chrysin displays these effects through selective modulation
  of multiple cell signaling pathways which are linked to inflammation, survival,
  growth, angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis of cancer cells. This broad spectrum
  of antitumor activity in conjunction with low toxicity underscores the translational
  value of chrysin in cancer therapy. The present review highlights the chemopreventive
  and therapeutic effects, molecular targets and antineoplastic mechanisms that contribute
  to the observed anticancer activity of chrysin.'
