text: "\n\n\n\nIsothiocyanates are molecules naturally present in many cruciferous
  vegetables. Several studies suggest that cruciferous vegetable consumption may reduce
  cancer risk and slow the aging process. To investigate the effect of ITCs on cellular
  DNA damage, we evaluated the effects of two different ITCs  on the biology of human
  mesenchymal stem cells, which, in addition to their ability to differentiate into
  mesenchymal tissues, contribute to the homeostatic maintenance of many organs. The
  choice of SFN and RPS relies on two considerations: they are among the most popular
  cruciferous vegetables in the diet of western and eastern countries, respectively,
  and their bioactive properties may differ since they possess specific molecular
  moiety. Our investigation evidenced that MSCs incubated with low doses of SFN and
  RPS show reduced in vitro oxidative stress. Moreover, these cells are protected
  from oxidative damages induced by hydrogen peroxide, while no protection was evident
  following treatment with the UV ray of a double strand DNA damaging drug, such as
  doxorubicin. High concentrations of both ITCs induced cytotoxic effects in MSC cultures
  and further increased DNA damage induced by peroxides. In summary, our study suggests
  that ITCs, at low doses, may contribute to slowing the aging process related to
  oxidative DNA damage. Moreover, in cancer treatment, low doses of ITCs may be used
  as an adjuvant to reduce chemotherapy-induced oxidative stress, while high doses
  may synergize with anticancer drugs to promote cell DNA damage.\n\n\n\nThe online
  version of this article contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized
  users.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe biological activity of cruciferous vegetables is hypothesized
  to be due to the presence of defensive secondary metabolites called glucosinolates
  as well as the enzyme myrosinase. When these vegetables are crushed by chopping
  or chewing, myrosinase catalyzes the rapid conversion of GLs into isothiocyanates
  . ITCs are a heterogeneous family of molecules with the –N=C=S group as their common
  moiety. Several ITCs have an additional sulfur atom in their molecular chain at
  different oxidation states. This may confer different biological properties .\n\nA
  number of studies have documented the chemopreventive properties of ITCs. In particular,
  many studies have addressed the biological properties of sulforaphane and raphasatin.
  This is because SFN and RPS are present in the most popular cruciferous vegetables
  in the diet of western and eastern countries, respectively, and their bioactive
  properties may differ since they possess specific molecular moiety . It has been
  demonstrated that these compounds could protect against the onset or reduce the
  severity of cancer, retinal disease, and skin damage resulting from exogenous agents
  or genetic predisposition and may slow the aging processes .\n\nSeveral mechanisms
  have been proposed to explain the effects of ITCs. Most researchers suggest that
  ITCs have an indirect antioxidant activity, which involves the activation of Phase-II
  detoxification enzymes and the inhibition of Phase-I enzymes that activate toxic
  chemical compounds. In this way, ITCs contributes to elevating the cell’s defenses
  against oxidative damage and promotes the removal of carcinogens . Some ITCs may
  also involve a direct anti-oxidant activity due to the presence of reduced sulphur
  in the side chain. Indeed, RPS was found to effectively quench hydrogen peroxide
  and organic hydroperoxides even if it did not show any activity capable of impairing
  a “radical chain reaction”, as occurs for effective direct anti-oxidant molecules
  .\n\nThe initial view of ITCs as selective monofunctional inducers of Phase-II antioxidant/detoxifying
  enzymes has lately given way to a more realistic consideration of their very complex
  oxidative stress modulation. Indeed, several findings clearly demonstrate that ITCs
  have to be considered hormetic molecules. The term hormesis has long been used to
  describe the phenomenon in which a specific chemical is able to induce biologically
  opposite effects at different doses; most commonly, there is a stimulatory or beneficial
  effect at low doses and an inhibitory or toxic effect at high doses . Toxic effects
  of ITCs may be associated with their pro-oxidant activities. High concentrations
  of ITCs rapidly accumulate into cells and can react and inactivate –SH groups, such
  as that of glutathione, which is a potent reactive oxygen scavenger .\n\nNevertheless,
  studies on the biological effects of ITCs have often overlooked the hormetic behavior
  of such compounds and have mainly analyzed the biological and molecular mechanisms
  of their anti-cancer activity. Furthermore, few studies have addressed the possible
  beneficial effects of ITCs on the body’s ability to reproduce healthy cells and
  protect against DNA damage. As an antioxidant, ITCs should protect cells from free
  radical damage, which is the primary cause of aging. Moreover, little is known about
  the effect of ITCs on stem cells, whose longevity is implicated in human aging.\n\nIn
  our previous work , we evaluated the effects of SFN on the biology of human mesenchymal
  stem cells, which, in addition to their ability to differentiate into mesenchymal
  tissues, support hematopoiesis and contribute to the homeostatic maintenance of
  many organs and tissues . Our investigation found evidence that low doses of SFN
  promote MSC proliferation and protect them from apoptosis and senescence, while
  higher doses have a cytotoxic effect leading to the induction of cell cycle arrest,
  programmed cell death, and senescence. The beneficial effects of SFN may be ascribed
  to its antioxidant properties, which were observed when MSC cultures were incubated
  with low doses of SFN. Indeed, low doses of SFN reduced the production of reactive
  oxygen species both in the basal state and under oxidative stress conditions. As
  expected for a hormetic compound, the protective action of SFN on MSCs was lost
  during high concentration treatment .\n\nExtensive research has revealed how the
  DNA damage-sensing and -signaling pathways, referred to as the DNA-damage response
  network, are tied to cellular senescence and apoptosis . Following DNA damage, a
  cell responds by activating the cell cycle checkpoint and repair mechanisms. If
  DNA damage cannot be properly repaired, damaged cells can be eliminated either by
  apoptosis or senescence. Changes in apoptosis and senescence rates in MSCs treated
  with different SFN concentration prompted us to investigate the degree of DNA damage
  in our cell system. To this end we evaluated the effect of two different ITCs on
  DNA damage of human MSCs. We evaluated the degree of DNA damage following the treatment
  of MSCs with different DNA damaging agents in the presence of different concentrations
  of ITCs. Our investigation found evidence that MSCs incubated with low doses of
  SFN and RPS show reduced in vitro oxidative stress, while high ITCs concentrations
  exacerbate DNA damage events.\n\n\n\n\n\nBone marrow was obtained from healthy donors
  who had provided informed consent. We separated cells through a Ficoll density gradient,
  and the mononuclear cell fraction was collected and washed in phosphate-buffered
  saline. We seeded 1–2.5 × 105 cells/cm2 in 100-mm dishes with α-modified Eagle’s
  medium containing 10 % fetal bovine serum, 2 ng/ml basic FGF, 2 mM l-glutamine,
  100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. After 24–48 h, non-adherent cells
  were discarded and adherent cells, including MSCs and committed progenitors, were
  washed twice with PBS. Cells were then incubated for 7–10 days in proliferating
  medium until they became confluent; they were then extensively propagated for subsequent
  experiments. All cell culture reagents were obtained from Euroclone Life Sciences
  and Hyclone, unless stated otherwise. Glucoraphanin and gluchoraphasatin, which
  are the precursors of SFN and RPS, respectively, were obtained as described previously
  . Myrosinase was added to the cell cultures together with a specific precursor to
  generate equal amounts of SFN or RPS by in situ catalyzed hydrolysis . In detail,
  cells were incubated for 72 h with 0.25, 1, 5, or 20 μM specific precursor and then
  collected for analysis.\n\n\n\nFor each assay, 3 × 105 cells were collected and
  resuspended in a hypotonic buffer containing propidium iodide. The cells were incubated
  in the dark and then analyzed. Samples were acquired on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer
  using the Cell Quest software and analyzed with a standard procedure using Cell
  Quest and ModFitLT softwares.\n\n\n\nFor BrdU immunostaining, the cells were grown
  on glass coverslips and incubated for 10 h with 10 μM BrdU. The cells were briefly
  rinsed with PBS, fixed with 100 % methanol at 4 °C for 10 min, air-dried, and then
  incubated with 2 N HCl for 60 min at 37 °C. HCl was neutralized with a 0.1 M borate
  buffer. Following additional PBS washes, the slides were incubated with an anti-BrdU
  mouse monoclonal antibody. After 60 min at RT, the cells were washed with PBS and
  incubated with goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies conjugated to peroxidase for
  60 min at RT. Finally, after additional washes in PBS, the slides were treated with
  DAB substrate.\n\n\n\nBone marrow cells were plated as described above. Cultures
  were expanded to 70–80 % confluency. On these cells, we carried out the cells for
  CFU assay, as reported . We briefly diluted the cells in a complete culture medium
  and plated them at about 1,000 cells per 100-mm tissue culture dish in a complete
  culture medium. The cells were incubated for 10–14 days at 37 °C in 5 % humidified
  CO2, and were washed with PBS and stained with 0.5 % Crystal Violet in methanol
  for 5–10 min at room temperature. Plates were washed with PBS and visible colonies
  were counted.\n\n\n\nMSC cultures were treated for 1 h with 300 μM of H2O2. Following
  treatment, the medium was removed and a complete medium was added. Cells were then
  collected for data analysis 24 h later.\n\nFor UV irradiation, cell plates with
  lids removed were irradiated with UV light by exposure to a germicidal lamp in a
  tissue culture hood. Following treatment, the medium was removed and a complete
  medium was added. Cells were collected 24 h later.\n\nFor the induction of DNA double
  strand breaks, MSCs were incubated for 6 h with 1 μM doxorubicin. Following treatment,
  the medium was removed and a complete medium was added. Cells were then collected
  for data analysis 24 h later.\n\n\n\nApoptotic cells were detected with fluorescein-conjugated
  Annexin V according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Apoptotic cells were observed
  through a fluorescence microscope. In every experiment, at least 1,000 cells were
  counted across different fields to calculate the percentage of dead cells in each
  culture.\n\n\n\nCells were fixed for 10 min with a solution of 2 % formaldehyde
  and 0.2 % glutaraldehyde. Fixed cells were washed with PBS and then incubated at
  37 °C for at least 2 h with a staining solution, 5 mM K4Fe(CN)6, 5 mM K3Fe(CN)6,
  150 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, and 1 mg/ml X-Gal solution). The percentage of senescent
  cells was calculated by dividing the number of blue cells observed across multiple
  fields by the total number of cells in those fields. At least 500 cells across different
  microscope fields were examined.\n\n\n\nCells were stimulated for 2 weeks in hMSC
  mesenchymal stem cell adipogenic differentiation medium. Lipid droplets were revealed
  by staining with oil red.\n\n\n\nCells were stimulated for 2 weeks in hMSC mesenchymal
  stem cell osteogenic differentiation medium. A calcium deposit in differentiated
  osteocytes was revealed by staining with alizarin red.\n\n\n\nCells were stimulated
  for 2 weeks in hMSC mesenchymal stem cell chondrogenic differentiation medium. Differentiated
  chondrocytes were revealed by staining with fast green and safranin O.\n\n\n\nH2AX
  was detected according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The cells were grown on coverslips,
  fixed with 4 % formaldehyde, and permeabilized with methanol. Blocking was carried
  out with a 5 % serum for 60 min at room temperature. Slides were incubated overnight
  with an anti-H2AX primary antibody. Afterwards, the slides were incubated with goat
  anti-rabbit secondary antibodies conjugated to FITCT for 45 min at RT. Hoechst 33342
  staining was performed and then the cells were observed through a fluorescence microscope.
  The percentage of H2AX-positive cells was calculated by counting at least 500 cells
  in different microscope fields.\n\n\n\n8oxodG within DNA was detected by immunocytochemistry
  with the anti-8oxodG primary antibody according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
  Hoechst 33342 staining was performed and then the cells were observed through a
  fluorescence microscope. The percentage of 8oxodG positive cells was calculated
  by counting at least 500 cells in different microscope fields.\n\n\n\nRegular slides
  were coated with 1 % agarose and allowed to dry overnight. The cells were suspended
  in 1 % low melting point agarose. 700 μl of this suspension were spread on a precoated
  slide and placed at 4 °C for 5 min. The slides were submersed in lysing solution
  for at least 1 h. Afterwards, the slides were transferred to an electrophoresis
  unit with a fresh alkaline buffer and subjected to an electric field of 0.86 V/cm
  for 20 min. Following electrophoresis, the microgels were neutralized in 0.4 M Tris,
  pH 7.5, and rinsed with water. The DNA was stained with Hoechst 33342 and the slides
  were observed through a fluorescence microscope. The interactive examination of
  slides was performed by Quantity One image analysis.\n\n\n\nTotal DNA was extracted
  from MSC cultures following the classical phenol DNA extraction protocol . DNA was
  digested for 1–2 h at 37 °C with T4 endonuclease V and resolved by electrophoresis
  on a 1 % agarose gel.\n\n\n\nTotal RNA was extracted from cell cultures using TRI
  REAGENT according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The mRNA levels of the genes analyzed
  were quantified by real-time reverse-transcription-PCR amplification, as reported
  previously .\n\nSequences of mRNAs from the Nucleotide Data Bank were used to design
  primer pairs for real-time RT-PCR reactions. Primer sequences are available upon
  request. Appropriate regions of HPRT and/or GAPDH cDNA were used as controls. The
  real-time PCR assays were run on an Opticon 4 machine. Reactions were carried out
  according to the manufacturer’s instructions using a SYBR green PCR master mix.
  Further data on the role of the analyzed genes and RT-PCR parameters can be found
  in supplemental file 2.\n\n\n\nStatistical significance was evaluated by ANOVA analysis
  followed by a Student’s t test and Bonferroni’s test.\n\n\n\nMSCs were incubated
  with different amounts of ITCs. Several findings evidenced that pharmacokinetic
  behavior of different ITCs are quite similar. The concentrations of ITCs we used
  ranged from 0.25 μM, the bioavailable concentration in serum following dietary supplementation,
  to 20 μM, the minimal bioactive concentration used as an anticancer drug .\n\nIn
  our previous study, we found that low doses of SFN promoted MSC proliferation and
  protected them from apoptosis and senescence, while higher doses had a cytotoxic
  effect leading to the induction of cell cycle arrest, programmed cell death, and
  senescence . Considering that ITCs are a very heterogeneous class of compounds,
  we decided to evaluate if another ITC, like the RPS, may have the same effect on
  the biology of MSCs.\n\n\n\nMSC cultures were treated for 3 days with RPS and then
  analyzed for cell cycle progression. The flow cytometry assay and BrdU incorporation
  evidenced an increase in cells that are duplicating DNA in the samples that were
  treated with 0.25, 1 and 5 μM RPS compared to the controls. Conversely, after treatment
  with 20 μM RPS, we observed a significant percentage of cells in G2/M. We were unable
  to carry out the BrdU assay for cells treated with 20 μM SFN, suggesting that cells
  accumulated in G2/M and did not proliferate. The data obtained for RPS overlapped
  that obtained with SFN treatment .\n\n\na Flow cytometry analysis. A representative
  FACS profile carried out on MSCs is depicted. The table shows the mean expression
  values and standard deviations of flow cytometry analysis performed in different
  experimental conditions. b BrdU assay. The micrograph shows a representative field

  on MSCs. Table shows the percentage of senescent cells. e CFU assay. The pictures
  show representative crystal violet staining of clones obtained after 14 days incubation
  of MSCs plated in the presence of different amounts of RPS. The table indicates
  the number of clones obtained in different experimental conditions. f Differentiation
  potential of MSCs cultivated in the presence of ITCs. Cells were induced to differentiate
  into adipocytes, osteocytes, and chondrocytes as described in the “Materials and
  methods” section. The picture on the left shows adipocytes stained wit with oil
  red. In the middle, differentiated chondrocytes were revealed by staining with safranin
  O. On the right, differentiated osteocytes were revealed by staining with alizarin
  red. The pictures show an example of differentiation processes in the presence of
  1 μM RPS\n\nLow concentrations of RPS reduced the percentage of apoptotic cells
  in MSC cultures, whereas incubation with 20 μM induced a significant increase in
  the number of apoptotic cells. These results are also in agreement with the SFN
  data .\n\nA hormetic behavior of RPS was also observed when looking at the senescence
  phenomena. Treatment with 5 and 20 μM RPS resulted in a significant increase in
  senescent cells, as detected by the acid-β-galactosidase assay. On the contrary,
  low doses of RPS provide a beneficial effect for MSCs by reducing the number of
  senescent cells. This finding was in agreement with the effect induced by SFN treatment.\n\nThe
  control of the stem cell properties may be affected by apoptosis and senescence
  phenomena; hence it is reasonable to have perturbation in the stem cell status of
  MSCs cultivated in presence of ITCs. In MSC cultures incubated with different concentrations
  of RPS, we carried out CFU assay to test the clonogenicity, i.e. the ability to
  expand at a single cell level, which is an important feature of self-renewing stem
  cells. Low concentrations of RPS did not modify the number of clones observed in
  100 mm plates seeded at a low density. At the opposite end, in cultures treated
  with 5 and 20 μM SFN or RPS we observed a significant reduction of clones. This
  result is in good agreement with the data on cell death and senescence. Experiments
  carried out with SFN gave similar results.\n\nThe differentiation of MSCs into mesenchymal
  derivatives occurs over a protracted period and appears to be accompanied by a progressive
  restriction in the range of fates available to individual cells. The modification
  of cell biology induced by ITC treatment could also affect the cell commitment and
  differentiation process. We assessed the multipotentiality of MSCs. To this end,
  we evaluated their osteo–chondro–adipogenic in the presence of different concentrations
  of RPS. Differentiation was not significantly affected by low doses of ITCs. Nevertheless,
  osteogenesis and chondrogenesis were severely impaired in cultures incubated with
  20 μM RPS. Experiments carried out with SFN gave similar results.\n\nTaken together,
  this data and our previous investigation  suggest that the two ITCs under investigation,
  which are present in the most popular cruciferous vegetables in the diet of western
  and eastern countries, have similar effects on stem cell biology. They may be considered
  hormetic molecules; at low doses, they may exert protective effects on stem cells,
  while at higher doses, they show cytostatic or cytotoxic effects.\n\n\n\nSenescence
  and apoptosis are tied to DNA damage pathways. Cells with damaged DNA activate the
  cell cycle checkpoint and repair mechanisms. If DNA damage cannot be properly repaired,
  damaged cells can be eliminated either by apoptosis or senescence. ITC treatment
  of MSCs may also affect the level of apoptosis and senescence through the modulation
  of DNA damage. For this reason, we decided to evaluate the effect of ITCs on the
  degree of damaged DNA in basal conditions and the following treatment of MSCs with
  different DNA damaging agents. We detected cells with damaged DNA by H2AX immunostaining.
  H2AX histone is a key regulator of the cellular responses to DNA damage and is considered
  a hallmark of damaged DNA nuclear foci.\n\nIn these experiments we treated cells
  with low doses of ITCs, since only these concentrations were protective for cells.
  In MSC cultures incubated with low concentrations of RPS, which reduce the degree
  of senescence and apoptosis, we observed a diminution in the number of cells labeled
  with anti H2AX compared to control. No significant reduction of H2AX staining was
  observed for SFN treated cells. These results show that RPN was very efficient in
  lowering the basal level of endogenous DNA damage, while SFN was not.\n\n\na Treatment

  and Hoechst 33342. Arrowheads indicate H2AX-positive nuclei. The mean percentage

  doses of ITCs. Top H2AX staining. Fluorescence photomicrographs show the merging
  of cells stained with anti-H2AX and Hoechst 33342. Arrowheads indicate H2AX-positive
  nuclei. The mean percentage of H2AX-positive cells is indicated in the table. A

  merging of cells stained with anti-H2AX and Hoechst 33342. The mean percentage of
  H2AX-positive cells is indicated in the table. A statistical evaluation was carried
  out on the total of H2AX positive cells. Significant variations are in bold. Bottom
  Comet assay. The picture shows a representative assay of MSCs that were untreated
  or treated with doxorubicin before performing Comet electrophoresis as described
  in the “Materials and methods” section. Quantitative data of Comet assay depicted
  in the table indicate the degree of DNA fragmentation\n\nFollowing analysis of DNA
  damage in basal condition, we determined protective effect of ITCs in presence of
  damaging agents.\n\nAs expected, H2O2 treatment of MSCs induced an increase of H2AX-positive
  cells. In H2O2 treated cultures, the percentage of H2AX-positive cells was lower
  in presence of 0.25 μM RPS and SFN compared with CTRL. Nevertheless, a closer analysis
  showed that RPS treatment did not protect from H2O2 damage since the percentage
  of H2AX-positive cells increased following peroxide treatment in cultures incubated
  with RPS. On the opposite, SFN that did not reduce significantly the basal level
  H2AX cells evidenced a protective effect against peroxide damage.\n\nH2O2 produces
  multiple modifications in DNA. Oxidative attack by OH radicals on the deoxyribose
  moiety leads to the release of free bases from DNA, generating strand breaks with
  various sugar modifications and simple abasic sites. H2O2 also induces the modification
  of bases, such as in the formation of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine. We analyzed the
  effects of hydrogen peroxide on the MSC by determining the percentage of oxo8dG-positive
  cells. H2O2 treatment of MSCs induced an increase of 8oxodG-positive cells. In H2O2
  treated cultures, the percentage of 8oxodG-positive cells was lower in presence
  of RPS and SFN compared with CTRL. Also in this case, a closer analysis showed that
  RPS treatment did not protect from H2O2 damage since the percentage of 8oxodG-positive
  cells increased following peroxide treatment in cultures incubated with RPS. SFN
  showed a certain degree of protection against peroxide damage.\n\nOverall, these
  results reveal that exogenously-induced DNA damage is different from endogenous
  DNA damage, and while the latter appears to be sensitive to RPS, the former is not.
  In this context, SFN appears to have a somewhat opposite effect, whereby it has
  very modest effect in reducing basal H2AX and 8-oxo-G, it has a respectable ability
  to attenuate the rise of these two markers of DNA damage when cells were treated
  with H2O2.\n\nIn cells treated with UV ray, the presence of low doses of ITCs did
  not protect the cells from DNA damage as detected by H2AX staining. UV radiation
  induces crosslinking between adjacent thymine bases, creating pyrimidine dimers.
  As such, the outcome of UV treatment was investigated by digesting genomic DNA with
  T4 endonuclease V in order to evaluate the level of pyrimidine dimers. This enzyme
  locates and binds to pyrimidine dimers in DNA, then cleaves the N-glycosylic bond
  of the 5′ pyrimidine portion of the dimer and breaks the 3′ phosphodiester bond
  to the resulting abasic site. This induces the fragmentation of DNA-containing dimers
  that can be easily analyzed. UV radiation induced the degradation of DNA in MSC
  cultures. Interestingly, treating cells with ITCs did not modify the fragmentation
  of DNA, as detected by agarose gel electrophoresis.\n\nDoxorubicin is a topoisomerase
  II-stabilizing drug that mainly induces DNA double strand breaks . In cells treated
  with doxorubicin, the presence of low doses of ITCs did not protect the cells from
  DNA damage as detected by H2AX staining. We determined the effect of doxorubicin
  also by detecting DNA breaks using COMET assay. Doxorubicin induced DNA fragmentation
  in MSC cultures. Interestingly, treating cells with ITCs showed an augment in the
  fragmentation of DNA, as detected by agarose gel electrophoresis. This result is
  in contrast with H2AX data, which showed neither protective nor exacerbating effect
  of ITC on doxorubicin induced DNA damage. Doxorubicin treated cells undergo apoptosis
  and then in the late stage of this process they detach from culture dishes. It may
  be hypothesized that the presence of ITCs, while not protecting from DNA damaging
  effects of doxorubicin, may slow apoptosis progression resulting in the presence
  of a higher number of cells with fragmented DNA that are still attached on the culture
  plate.\n\n\n\nBased on the observation that low concentrations of ITCs trigger a
  positive DNA damage response in MSCs incubated with peroxide hydrogen, we investigated
  whether the ITC treatment of MSCs was accompanied by changes in expression of genes
  involved in different types of DNA repair. We selected a variety of genes involved
  in the regulation of base and nucleotide excision repair, mismatch repair, and double
  strand break repair . A complex expression pattern was observed following incubation
  with SFN or RPS.\n\n\nQuantitative RT-PCR analysis of mRNA expression from MSCs
  incubated with or without SFN or RPS and with H2O2 in presence or absence of SFN
  or RPS  \n\n\nThe mRNA levels were normalized with respect to GAPDH, which was selected
  as an internal control. Each experiment was repeated at least three times. Table
  shows mRNA expression levels at 72 h post-treatment. Data are expressed as arbitrary
  units with standard deviation. In cells incubated with SFN or RPS the gene expression
  levels indicated in bold and in italic are statistically higher and lower than in
  the corresponding cells grown without ITCs\n\nFurther data on the role of these
  genes in DNA repair and RT-PCR parameters are in supplemental file 2\n\n\nDSB double
  strand break repair pathway, MER mismatch repair pathway, BER base excision repair
  pathway; NER nucleotide excision repair pathway, n.d. not detected\n\nIn basal conditions
  we observed a general upregulation of DNA repair genes in cells incubated with 0.25
  μM SFN, 1 μM SFN and 0.25 μM RPS compared with control.\n\nIn H2O2 treated cells
  some DNA repair genes were upregulated and some other showed decreased expression
  compared with control. This may suggest that cell machinery is trying to counteract
  exogenous DNA damage event.\n\nThe H2O2 treatment in presence of ITCs gave interesting
  results. In detail, cells incubated with 0.25 μM SFN and treated with peroxide hydrogen
  showed a general increase in the expression of DNA repair genes compared with cells
  incubated with H2O2 without SFN. Incubation with 0.25 μM RPS produced the upregulation
  of a lesser number of DNA repair genes, while, in all other conditions we detected
  a decrease in the expression of many DNA repair genes.\n\nIn this context, the observation
  that 0.25 μM SFN has the ability to exert an effect on exogenous H2O2-derived source
  of DNA damage is in line with the upregulation of DNA repair genes. On the other
  hand, higher concentration of ITCs may exacerbate DNA damage also through downregulation
  of DNA repair gene activity.\n\n\n\nMany researchers are committed to showing that
  curative properties of foods have gone beyond mere folklore. Nutraceutic studies
  are indeed devoted to demonstrate that a product isolated or purified from foods,
  which is generally sold in medicinal forms not usually associated with food, may
  have a physiological benefit on human health. Among hundreds of nutraceutic products,
  many scientist are focusing their attention on Brassica vegetables because of their
  content in ITC metabolites and because these vegetables are broadly present in the
  diet of western and eastern countries. Several studies have suggested that ITCs
  may slow aging and prevent cancer due to their anti-oxidant properties. Nevertheless,
  these compounds are hormetic molecules, which may induce biologically opposite effects
  at different doses; most commonly, there is a stimulatory or beneficial effect at
  low doses and an inhibitory or toxic effect at high doses . Toxic effects of ITCs
  may be associated with their pro-oxidant activities.\n\nTo gain an in depth view
  on the physiological effects of ITCs, we decided to investigate their role in stem
  cell biology. We chose this because several studies have demonstrated that aging
  is partly the result of an age-associated decline in stem cell self-renewal, replication,
  and lineage commitment . Moreover, mutations in the stem cell reservoir may give
  rise to transformed stem cells that sustain the onset of cancer . We focused our
  interest on the effect of ITCs on DNA damage pathways since the modulation of reactive
  oxygen levels is strictly associated with macromolecule damages.\n\nIn the current
  study, and in our previous research , we found that low doses of SFN and RPS promote
  MSC proliferation and protect cells from apoptosis and senescence, while higher
  doses had a cytotoxic effect leading to the induction of cell cycle arrest, programmed
  cell death, and senescence. Of interest is that no significant differences were
  detected in the biological effects of two compounds even if RPS has a reduced sulphur
  atom in the side chain that is absent in SFN. It could be deduced that this reduced
  atom did not cause further anti-oxidant activity, as it was hypothesized .\n\nOur
  data suggests that both SFN and RPS may induce biologically opposite effects at
  different doses. The effect of SFN and RPS on the level of cellular DNA damage was
  investigated under the basal condition and under different stress conditions. Low
  doses of SFN and RPS reduced the degree of DNA damage in the basal state. This is
  in agreement with the reduced percentage of apoptosis and senescence observed .
  In addition, at a 5 and 20 μM concentration, the protective action of ITCs was lost.
  This finding may be related to the observation that high doses of ITC may have pro-oxidant
  properties due to their ability to cause glutathione depletion and superoxide production
  in cells.\n\nWe then evaluated the effects of ITCs under stress conditions. UV rays
  and doxorubicin treatments of MSCs augmented the percentage of H2AX-positive cells.
  This was associated with an increased presence of pyrimidine dimers and DNA double
  strand breaks in cells treated with UV rays and doxorubicin, respectively. The presence
  of ITCs in the culture medium did not modify the degree of observed damage.\n\nOf
  interest is that following the oxidative damage of DNA, ITCs showed a hormetic behavior.
  Low concentrations of ITCs reduced the percentage of oxidized DNA bases, whereas
  at high doses they boost DNA damage. This ability in modulating the level of oxidative
  DNA damage is also related to the function of genes involved in DNA repair. Following
  oxidative damage, we observed the activation of several genes involved in DNA repair
  pathways. The presence of low concentration of ITCs in culture media attenuated
  the “activation” of DNA repair genes. This may be explained considering that ITCs
  exert a protective effect against peroxide damage by reducing the level of damaged
  DNA and the need of a strong cellular counteraction.\n\nOur study suggests that
  both SFN and RPS may have a beneficial role on human health by fighting aging and
  cancer. Low doses of ITCs, as they can be taken with dietary amounts of Brassica
  vegetables, reduce cellular stress that is associated with DNA damage. This, in
  turn, decreases the rate of senescence in the stem cell compartment. Dietary consumption
  of Brassica vegetables may hence be valuable in slowing the aging process. In this
  respect, Brassica vegetables could be considered a functional food, i.e., a conventional
  food that is consumed as part of a usual diet, and it has physiological benefits
  and/or reduces the risk of chronic disease beyond basic nutritional functions .\n\nA
  different consideration has to be made about ITCs and cancer. These compounds could
  be used as true nutraceutics and not only as bioactive compounds present in functional
  food. Several adverse effects of chemotherapy treatments have been described, and
  most of these effects are associated with the cellular oxidative stress of antineoplastic
  drugs . As a result, there is significant interest in developing adjuvant chemotherapies
  to augment the currently available treatment protocols, which may allow for decreased
  side effects and toxicity without compromising therapeutic efficacy. ITCs at low
  concentrations, with their anti-oxidant effects, may be potential candidates. On
  the other hand, the treatment of cancer patients with high concentrations of ITCs
  may potentiate the effects of other neoplastic drugs by promoting the senescence
  and apoptosis of cancer cells.\n\n\n\n\n\n"
