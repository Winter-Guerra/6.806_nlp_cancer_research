  Cancer invasion and metastasis are the main causes of treatment failure and death
  in cancer patients. Piceatannol is a natural analogue of resveratrol. This study
  investigated the anti-invasive mechanisms of piceatannol in MDA-MB-231 cells. Piceatannol
  significantly reduced serum-induced cell invasion and migration as well as adhesion
  without affecting the viability of cells. Furthermore, piceatannol markedly inhibited
  matrix metalloproteinase-9 activity and expression at both protein and mRNA levels.
  Piceatannol attenuated phosphoinisitide-3-kinase and phosphorylation of AKT and
  mammalian target of rapamycin, whereas phosphatase and tensin homologue was increased.
  Moreover, piceatannol inhibited nuclear factor kappa B transcriptional activity
  and DNA binding of NF-κB on MMP-9 promoter. In addition, piceatannol diminished
  NF-κB nuclear translocation through blocking the inhibitor of NF-κB alpha phosphorylation
  in the cytoplasm. These results proposed piceatannol as a potential anti-invasive
  agent by inhibiting MMP-9 involved in PI3K/AKT and NF-κB pathways.







  Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer and the first leading cause
  of cancer death in females worldwide, accounting for 23% of the total new cancer
  cases and 14% of the total cancer deaths in 2008.(1) Approximately 15–20% of breast
  cancer cases are in the category of triple-negative phenotype, named due to its
  lack of estrogen receptor-α and progesterone receptor and amplification of epidermal
  growth factor receptor. Patients with triple-negative breast cancers have a very
  poor disease-free survival because these breast cancers are aggressive and show
  a high rate of metastasis compared with other types of breast cancers.(2, 3)


  Invasion and metastasis are predominant properties of malignant cancer cells.(4)
  Approximately 90% of cancer patients die as a result of invasive and metastatic
  growth of cancer, which remains one of the greatest causes of poor clinical outcome.(4,
  5) Because matrix metalloproteinases play critical roles in the degradation of extracellular
  matrix, which acts as a mechanical barrier to cell movement, the proteolytic activities
  of MMPs are involved in the metastasis process including cell adhesion, migration,
  and invasion.(6-8) Among all of the MMPs, MMP-9, known as a gelatinase B, is overexpressed
  in breast cancer cells(6, 7) and necessary or sufficient for the metastatic spread
  to the brain tissue during breast cancer progression.(9) Thus, MMP-9 is an attractive
  target for suppressing breast cancer invasion and metastasis, and inhibition of
  MMP-9 may have enormous advantages in cancer therapy.


  The development of novel compounds with low toxicity and excellent potential for
  cancer chemoprevention or treatment is an important part of cancer therapies. Some
  natural products have been investigated as therapeutic agents for breast cancer
  due to their safety and several biological activities(2, 3, 10) Piceatannol is a
  natural analogue of resveratrol, a natural antioxidant derived from grapes, and
  is a naturally occurring polyphenol present in the skins of grapes, red wine, and
  other foods.(11-13) It has been demonstrated to exhibit anticancer, anti-inflammatory,
  and cardioprotective properties.(12) Piceatannol has been reported to induce apoptosis(14,
  15) and to inhibit cell cycle progression(16, 17) in various types of human cancers
  and to act as an agonist for estrogen receptor α in human breast cancer cells.(18)
  Although recent experimental data revealed the anticancer potency of piceatannol,
  the effect of piceatannol on cancer invasion and the mechanisms underlying its effect
  are not yet fully understood in breast cancer. A limited number of studies showed
  that piceatannol inhibited the invasion of prostate cancer cells(12) and lung metastasis
  of Lewis lung cancer cells.(19) In this study, we investigated the anti-invasive
  mechanisms of piceatannol in the triple-negative and highly invasive human breast
  cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231, and demonstrated for the first time that the inhibitory
  effect of piceatannol on invasion of human breast cancer cells is involved in attenuating
  PI3K/AKT and NF-κB-mediated MMP-9.





  MDA-MB-231 cell line was purchased from a Korean cell line bank and maintained in
  RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10000 U/L penicillin, and 10
  mg/L streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells were treated
  with various concentrations of piceatannol in a serum-free culture medium.



  The effect of piceatannol on the cell viability of MDA-MB-231 cells was evaluated
  by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. Cells were
  seeded at a density of 1 × 104 cells per well in a 96-well plate, cultured for 24
  h, and then treated with piceatannol. After 24 h of incubation, 30 μL of MTT solution
  was added to each well and incubated for 2 h. The viable cell number was correlated
  with the production of formazan, which was dissolved with dimethyl sulfoxide, and
  optical density was measured by microplate reader at 570 nm. Cell viability was
  calculated by the following equation: cell viability = / × 100.



  An invasion assay was carried out using modified 48-well microchemotaxis chambers.
  A polyvinyl-pyrrolidone-free polycarbonate filter was coated with matrigel. The
  lower chamber was filled with medium containing 10% FBS and 0.1% BSA as chemoattractant
  agents. The coated filter and upper chamber were laid over the lower chamber. Cells
  were preincubated with piceatannol for 30 min at room temperature, and then cell
  suspension containing piceatannol and 0.1% BSA was seeded onto the upper chamber
  wells. After incubation for 15 h at 37 °C, the filter was fixed and stained with
  Diff-Quick, and nonmigrated cells on the upper surface of the filter were wiped
  off with a swab. Then randomly chosen fields were photographed under a microscope,
  and the number of cells migrated to the lower surface was calculated.



  The migration ability of cells was assayed by a wound-healing assay. Cells were
  seeded in a 6-well plate and incubated at 37 °C. The confluent cells were scratched
  with a 200 μL pipet tip, followed by washing with PBS, and then treated with piceatannol
  in a complete medium. After 24 h of incubation, the cells were fixed and stained
  with Diff-Quick, and randomly chosen fields were photographed under a fluorescence
  microscope. The number of cells migrated into the scratched area was calculated.



  Cells preincubated with piceatannol for 20 min at 37 °C were seeded in a 96-well
  plate coated with matrigel for 10 min at 37 °C. Unattached cells were removed by
  washing with PBS. Attached cells were fixed in 1% glutaraldehyde in PBS for 20 min,
  stained with 0.02% crystal violet solution for 5 min at room temperature, and randomly
  chosen fields were photographed under a fluorescence microscope. Then, to quantify
  the number of attached cells, crystal violet was dissolved with 70% ethanol and
  O.D. was measured by microplate reader at 570 nm, reference 405 nm. The adhesion
  cells were calculated as a percentage of adhesion.



  The activity of MMP-9 in the conditioned medium was assessed by gelatin zymography.
  Cells were seeded in a 6-well plate and treated with piceatannol for 24 h. The culture
  medium from treated cells was collected and concentrated using a microcon. Equal
  amounts of concentrated CM were mixed with sample buffer without reducing agent,
  incubated for 15 min at room temperature, and then separated on 10% sodium dodecyl
  sulfate–polyacrylamide gel polymerized with 0.1% gelatin. After electrophoresis,
  the gels were washed with 2.5% Triton X-100 and incubated in a reaction buffer for
  18 h at 37 °C. After incubation, the gels were stained with 0.25% Coomassie brilliant
  blue R-250 in 7% glacial acetic acid and 40% methanol and then destained with 10%
  glacial acetic acid in 10% methanol. MMP-9 activity was visualized as clear bands
  against the blue-stained gelatin background. The bands of gelatin zymography were
  quantified using Image J 1.40 g software.



  Cells were seeded in a 6-well plate and treated with piceatannol for 24 h. The CM
  was collected, and secreted MMP-9 protein was then measured using a Human MMP-9
  Immunoassay kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol.


  RNA Isolation and Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction Analysis


  Total RNA was prepared by using the Trizol reagent according to the manufacturer’s
  protocol. RT-PCR analysis was then performed as previously described.(20) The PCR
  conditions were as follows: 94 °C for 30 s, 65 °C for MMP-9 and TIMP-1 or 59 °C
  for GAPDH for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. Samples were subjected to 40 cycles for
  MMP-9, 25 cycles for TIMP-1, and 35 cycles for GAPDH. The primer sequences used
  and their product sizes were as follows: MMP-9 forward, 5′-CGCTACCACCTCGAACTTTG-3′;
  MMP-9 reverse, 5′-GCCATTCACGTCGTCCTTAT-3′; TIMP-1 forward, 5′-CACCCACAGACGGCCTTCTGC-3′;
  TIMP-1 reverse, 5′-AGTGTAGTCTTGGTGAAGCC-3′; GAPDH forward, 5′-TCACCATCTTCCAGGAGCGA-3′;
  GAPDH reverse, 5′-CACAATGCCGAAGTGGTCGT-3′. The PCR products were separated on 2%
  agarose gels. The bands of RT-PCR were quantified using Image J 1.40 g software.



  The cells treated with piceatannol for 24 h were fractionated into cytoplasmic and
  nuclear extracts using NE-PER nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagents according
  to the manufacturer’s protocol.



  Equal amounts of proteins were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE gel and then electrotransferred
  onto a Hybond ECL transfer membrane at 300 mA for 90 min. After blocking with 5%
  nonfat skim milk, the membrane was probed with primary antibodies for NF-κB p65,
  phospho-IκBα, α-tublin, PARP, PTEN, PI3K p85, phospho-AKT, AKT, phospho-mTOR, and
  mTOR and specific secondary antibodies. The protein expression was detected by enhanced
  chemiluminescence system.



  Cells were transfected with the NF-κB luciferase reporter construct using an X-tremeGENE
  HP DNA transfection reagent. After transfection for 18 h, the cells were treated
  with piceatannol for 24 h. Luciferase activity was measured using the Dual-Luciferase
  assay system with a LUMistar OPTIMA microplate luminometer.



  The cells treated with piceatannol for 24 h were processed for ChIP assay using
  a SimpleChIP Enzymatic Chromatin IP kit. Briefly, immunoprecipitation was performed
  with NF-κB p65 or rabbit IgG as a control. The NF-κB binding site of MMP-9 promoter
  was detected by PCR using the following primers: 5′-GACCAAGGGATGGGGGATC-3′ and 5′-CTTGACAGGCAAGTGCTGAC-3′.



  Cells were seeded in a coverglass bottom dish and treated with piceatannol. After
  washing with PBS, the cells were fixed in 4% methanol-free formaldehyde solution
  at 4 °C for 25 min, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton-X 100 in PBS for 5 min, and blocked
  in blocking buffer for 2 h. Then the cells were incubated with anti-NF-κB p65 primary
  antibody for 1 h at room temperature, washed with PBS, and incubated with the FITC-labeled
  secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were counterstained with
  propidium iodide solution, mounted, and visualized under a FLUOVIEW FV10i confocal
  microscope.



  All data are presented as the mean ± SD from at least three independent experiments.
  All statistics were calculated by Student’s t test using Sigma plot software, and
  a p value of ;0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.





  To investigate the anti-invasive potential of piceatannol in breast cancer cells,
  invasion assay was performed in the triple-negative and highly invasive human breast
  cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231, using 48-well microchemotaxis chambers. Piceatannol
  showed no significant difference in cell viability up to 10 μM by MTT assay. The
  results showed that exposure of cells to 10% of serum caused a 3.1-fold increase
  in the invasion of cells into matrigel, a solubilized basement membrane matrix.
  However, serum-induced cell invasion was significantly reduced by piceatannol in
  a concentration-dependent manner. To better understand the inhibitory effect of
  piceatannol on cell invasion, cell migration and cell attachment were investigated
  by wound-healing and adhesion assays, respectively. As shown in Figure 1B, piceatannol
  significantly decreased serum-induced cell migration by 13, 22, and 33% of untreated
  control at 2, 5, and 10 μM, respectively. Piceatannol treatment also dramatically
  reduced cell adhesion to matrigel in a concentration-dependent manner compared with
  untreated control. These results indicated that piceatannol has an anti-invasive
  activity on breast cancer without affecting the viability of cells.


  Figure 1. Piceatannol reduces the invasion, migration, and adhesion of MDA-MB-231
  cells. Invasion assay was carried out using modified 48-well microchemotaxis chambers.
  Then randomly chosen fields were photographed, and the number of cells migrated
  to the lower surface was calculated as a percentage of invasion. Scale bar = 100

  MMPs play an essential role in the degradation of matrix barriers surrounding the
  tumor, such as ECM, for tumor growth, invasion, angiogenesis, and metastasis.(6-8)
  MMP-9 is abundantly expressed in breast cancer cells, and its proteolytic activity
  contributes to cell invasion and metastasis.(6-9) To determine whether the inhibitory
  effect of piceatannol on cell invasion was associated with the activity of MMP-9
  in MDA-MB-231 cells, gelatin zymography was performed using the concentrated CM
  from the piceatannol-treated cells. As shown in Figure 2A,B, piceatannol was markedly
  effective in inhibiting the gelatinolytic activity of MMP-9, which was significantly
  inhibited by 12, 27, and 60% of untreated control in the piceatannol-treated cells
  at 2, 5, and 10 μM, respectively. This result revealed that piceatannol-reduced
  cell invasion was attributed to the inhibition of the activity of MMP-9.


  Figure 2. Piceatannol inhibits the activity and down-regulates the protein and mRNA
  expression of MMP-9 in MDA-MB-231 cells. Cells were treated with piceatannol for
  24 h. The activity of MMP-9 was assessed using the concentrated CM by gelatin zymography.
  The bands of gelatin zymography were quantified. Data are shown as the mean ± SD
  of six independent experiments by analysis of Student’s t test. n = 6. The protein
  level of MMP-9 in CM was measured using an ELISA kit. Data are shown as the mean
  ± SD of two independent experiments by analysis of Student’s t test. n = 8. The
  mRNA expression of MMP-9 and TIMP-1 was determined by RT-PCR analysis. Then the
  bands of products were quantified, and the ratio of MMP-9/TIMP-1 mRNA expression
  was calculated. Data are shown as the mean ± SD of three independent experiments
  by analysis of Student’s t test. ∗, p &lt; 0.05, ∗∗, p &lt; 0.01, and ∗∗∗, p &lt;
  0.001, vs untreated control. n = 3.


  Piceatannol Down-regulates the Protein and mRNA Expression of MMP-9 in MDA-MB-231
  Cells


  The protein level of MMP-9 in the CM was evaluated using a MMP-9 ELISA kit. Piceatannol
  treatment resulted in 25 and 64% inhibition of MMP-9 secretion at 5 and 10 μM compared
  with untreated control, respectively. To define whether the inhibitory effect of
  piceatannol on the protein expression of MMP-9 resulted from a depressed level of
  MMP-9 mRNA expression, RT-PCR was carried out. Piceatannol remarkably down-regulated
  MMP-9 mRNA expression level by 21 and 53% of untreated control at 5 and 10 μM, respectively.
  However, after piceatannol treatment, no effect was observed on the mRNA expression
  of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1, an inhibitor of MMP-9(21).



  The PI3K/AKT pathway is frequently activated in breast cancer(22) and promotes cancer
  cell invasion and metastasis through up-regulation of MMP-9.(23) Thus, to identify
  whether the PI3K/AKT pathway was related to piceatannol-inhibited MMP-9, Western
  blot analysis was performed. Piceatannol significantly suppressed PI3K and phospho-AKT
  at 5 and 10 μM and phospho-mTOR at 10 μM, whereas it had no evident effect on total
  ATK and mTOR. In contrast, PTEN was increased by piceatannol. These results suggested
  that piceatannol inhibited MMP-9 activity through attenuating the PI3K/AKT pathway
  in MDA-MB-231 cells.


  Figure 3. Piceatannol attenuates the PI3K/AKT pathway in MDA-MB-231 cells. Cells
  were treated with piceatannol for 24 h. Equal amounts of proteins were analyzed
  by Western blot using indicated antibodies. The bands of Western blot were quantified.
  Data are shown as the mean ± SD of two independent experiments by analysis of Student’s
  t test. ∗, p &lt; 0.05, ∗∗, p &lt; 0.01, and ∗∗∗, p &lt; 0.001, vs untreated control.
  n = 2.



  The NF-κB pathway is a key transcription factor in the regulation of MMP-9 expression.(24,
  25) To further understand inhibitory mechanisms of piceatannol on MMP-9 transcriptional
  regulation, the NF-κB signaling pathway was investigated by reporter assay and ChIP
  assay. Piceatannol strikingly inhibited NF-κB transcriptional activity at 5 and
  10 μM and DNA binding of NF-κB on MMP-9 promoter at 10 μM. The nuclear translocation
  of NF-κB was detected by immunofluorescence assay. Figure 4C showed that the NF-κB
  p65 subunit accumulated in the nucleus in untreated control, but not in 10 μM piceatannol-treated
  cells. These results were confirmed by Western blot analysis. NF-κB expression in
  the nucleus and the phosphorylation of IκBα in the cytoplasm were diminished by
  piceatannol. These results demonstrated that piceatannol blocked the activation
  of the NF-κB signaling pathway by exerting an inhibitory effect on IκBα phosphorylation.

  with the NF-κB luciferase reporter construct for 18 h and then treated with piceatannol.

  shown as the mean ± SD of two independent experiments by analysis of Student’s t

  SD of three independent experiments by analysis of Student’s t test. n = 3. Cells

  The cells were visualized under a confocal microscope. Scale bar = 20 μm. Cells
  treated with piceatannol were fractionated into cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts.
  Equal amounts of proteins were analyzed by Western blot using indicated antibodies,
  and the bands of Western blot were quantified. α-Tubulin and PARP were used as loading
  controls of cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts, respectively. Data are shown as the
  mean ± SD of two independent experiments by analysis of Student’s t test. ∗, p &lt;

  Cancer invasion and metastasis are the main causes of treatment failure and the
  primary causes of death in cancer patients.(26) Therefore, therapeutic strategies
  for preventing or suppressing cancer invasion and metastasis would greatly improve
  survival of cancer patients. A vital step in the invasive processes is the proteolytic
  degradation of the ECM by proteolytic enzymes, such as MMPs.(6) MMPs are involved
  not only in ECM degradation but also in cell migration, wound healing, and adhesion.(4,
  7, 21)


  A limited number of studies showed that piceatannol inhibited invasion of prostate
  cancer cells(12) and lung metastasis of Lewis lung cancer cells.(19) However, the
  effect of piceatannol on cancer invasion is not yet fully understood in breast cancer.
  We demonstrated that piceatannol strikingly inhibited the invasive and migratory
  abilities of MDA-MB-231 cells at noncytotoxic concentrations. The attachment of
  tumor cells to the ECM and their interactions were crucial steps in the invasion
  and metastatic processes.(27) We revealed that piceatannol treatment dramatically
  reduced cell adhesion to matrigel. Several studies have demonstrated that up-regulation
  of several MMPs, such as MMP-9, contributed to cancer invasion and metastasis.(6-9,
  28) We identified that piceatannol markedly inhibited the gelatinolytic activity
  and secretion of MMP-9, which resulted from regulating MMP-9 without affecting TIMP-2
  at the transcriptional level. The imbalance between MMPs and their natural inhibitors,
  TIMPs, plays a decisive role in the degradation of ECM to enhance the invasive and
  metastatic capacity of cancer.(6, 21) Overall, these results suggested that piceatannol
  possessed the anti-invasive potential against breast cancer cells by inhibiting
  the activity and expression of MMP-9.


  PI3K is a lipid kinase that controls multiple cellular processes through AKT activation.
  AKT, a well established survival factor, promotes cell growth by inducing cytoplasmic
  localization of p21WAF1 and exerts an anti-apoptotic effect by inactivating pro-apoptotic
  factor BAD and caspase-9. Furthermore, AKT activation leads to cancer invasion and
  metastasis by stimulating the secretion of MMPs.(23, 29-31) Previous study demonstrated
  that mTOR, one of the downstream targets of AKT, was one mechanism in a tightly
  regulated network of intracellular signal pathways and contributed to the invasiveness
  of human trophoblast cells by secretion of ECM-remodeling enzymes such as MMP-2
  and -9.(32) PTEN is a dual-specificity lipid phosphatase and tumor suppressor, which
  negatively regulates the PI3K/AKT pathway by inhibiting AKT activation. On the contrary,
  loss of PTEN activity by mutations or deletions results in activation of AKT.(33-35)
  It was reported that the MMP-9 mRNA level was correlated with the PI3K/AKT/mTOR
  pathway and inversely correlated with PTEN.(23) Our data showed that piceatannol
  increased PTEN but inhibited PI3K and phosphorylation of AKT and mTOR.


  The NF-κB pathway is a downstream target of AKT(31) and a key transcription factor
  in the regulation of MMP-9 expression.(24, 25) NF-κB is closely linked to inflammation,
  tumor cell proliferation, survival, invasion, and metastasis.(36) Furthermore, NF-κB
  is constitutively activated in many cancers, which contributes to chemo- and radio-resistance
  via the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins.(37, 38) Thus, the inhibition of NF-κB
  signaling may achieve improved therapeutic outcome. Previous studies clarified that
  tumor invasion is suppressed by inhibiting NF-κB-mediated MMP-9 expression.(24,
  25, 39) NF-κB is activated by the phosphorylation-induced degradation of IκBs, which
  facilitates the dissociation of IκB family proteins from NF-κB. The liberated NF-κB
  translocates to the nucleus and binds to the promoter region of target genes, such
  as MMP-9, thereby leading to gene expression.(25, 36) In this study, we demonstrated
  that piceatannol inhibited NF-κB transcriptional activity and DNA binding of NF-κB
  on MMP-9 promoter. According to the previous study, piceatannol inhibited TNF-induced
  NF-κB activation and nuclear translocation.(40) We also verified that the nuclear
  translocation of NF-κB was blocked by piceatannol, which was due to the inhibition
  of IκBα phosphorylation in the cytoplasm. These results demonstrated that piceatannol-induced
  inhibition of MMP-9 was attributed to blocking of NF-κB transcriptional activity.


  In conclusion, we demonstrated for the first time that piceatannol suppressed the
  invasive ability of MDA-MB-231 cells, including invasion, migration, and adhesion,
  by inhibiting MMP-9 activity and expression through increasing PTEN, attenuating
  the PI3K/AKT pathway, and blocking NF-κB activation. These results provided new
  insight into molecular mechanisms involved in the anti-invasive activity of piceatannol
  in breast cancer cells and strongly suggested that piceatannol is a useful anti-invasive
  agent for breast cancer.
