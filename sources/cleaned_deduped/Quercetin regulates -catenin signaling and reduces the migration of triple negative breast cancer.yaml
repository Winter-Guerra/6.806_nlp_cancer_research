  regulates -catenin signaling and reduces the migration of triple negative breast
  cancer.md
text: '


  Triple negative breast cancer  is characterized by a lack in estrogen, progesterone,
  and epidermal growth factor 2 receptors. TNBC exhibits most of the characteristics
  of basal-like and claudin-low breast cancer subtypes. The main contributor in the
  mortality of TNBC is due to the higher invasive and migratory ability of these tumor
  cells. Some plant flavonoids inhibit the epithelial mesenchymal transition  of tumor
  cells and suppress cancer metastasis. In this study, we aimed to determine whether
  the flavonoid quercetin is effective in modulating the molecular signaling associated
  with EMT in TNBC. Our data indicated that quercetin can induce the expression of
  E-cadherin and also downregulate vimentin levels in TNBC. The ability of quercetin
  to modulate these EMT markers resulted in a mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition.
  Quercetin-induced MET was linked with the alteration of nuclear localization of
  -catenin and modulation of -catenin target genes such as cyclin D1 and c-Myc. Furthermore,
  we observed that quercetin induced the anti-tumor activity of doxorubicin by inhibiting
  the migratory ability of TNBC cells. These results suggested that quercetin may
  inhibit TNBC metastasis and also improve the therapeutic efficacy of existing chemotherapeutic
  drugs.  2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.


  Triple negative breast cancer  comprises approximately 10-30% of all breast cancers.
  It is characterized by the absence of estrogen, progesterone, and epidermal growth
  factor 2 receptors. Since these three receptors are the drug targets to treat breast
  cancer, current successful therapies such as hormone and antibody therapies are
  not effective to this patient population. Furthermore, targeted therapy for TNBC
  treatment has not yet been established due to the absence of identification of pathway
  specific targets. Current chemotherapy options are beneficial to the TNBC patient
  population and the response to chemotherapy is higher in compared to other breast
  cancer subtypes. However, the relapse rates are higher in first three years after
  treatment and chemotherapy resistance tend to develop, which causes reduction in
  the chemotherapy potential for TNBC treatment. The metastatic form of TNBC is very
  aggressive and treatment options are limited.


  Better treatment options are needed that are less toxic, reduce the risk of disease
  progression, and are more targeted to this patient population. This is possible
  by identification of new targets or by detection of new novel molecules, which will
  inhibit the tumor proliferation and migration and diminish the drug resistance.
  Different promising areas of research are currently underway for the identification
  of newer biologic and targeted therapies for TNBC population, such as development
  of poly ADP ribose polymerase  inhibitors, EGFR inhibitors, and therapies that target
  cancer stem cells.


  Scientific research has focused recently on the anti-carcinogenic effect of different
  flavonoids. Flavonoids are polyphenolic compounds in vegetables and fruits that
  can protect against the development and progression of breast cancer. In particular,
  quercetin has been found to have anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.
  Quercetin is present in various fruits, vegetables, seeds, nuts, green tea, and
  red wine. Studies have documented the anti-cancer activity of quercetin in various
  cancer cells. Studies suggested that the biological activity of quercetin is exhibited
  by acting on multi targets. This anti-cancer activity has been attributed to different
  mechanisms, such as anti-oxidant activity, inhibition of enzymes that activate oncogenes,
  modification of signal transduction pathways, and interaction with different proteins
  enzymes and receptors. Studies have also suggested that quercetin protects the toxic
  effect of doxorubicin or cisplatin-induced damages in cancer cell. The mechanism
  of action of anti-carcinogenic activity of quercetin in TNBC is not yet elucidated.
  Most of the earlier studies elucidated the anti-proliferative effect of quercetin
  in various cancer cells. However, few studies have pointed towards the anti-invasive
  efficacy of flavonoid quercetin in cancer cells. Flavonoids inhibit cancer metastasis
  by suppressing of matrix metalloproteinase  secretion and reducing the angiogenesis.
  A recent study suggested that addition of luteolin and quercetin in a human epidermal
  cancer cell line  resulted in the inhibition of invadopodia formation and decrement
  of extracellular matrix  degradation. But detailed studies have not yet been carried
  out to reveal how quercetin might inhibit invasive breast cancer cells.


  Research has established that epithelial mesenchymal transition  is a crucial mechanism
  for gaining the invasive and migratory ability of cancer cells. This phenomenon
  can be reversed by modulating the molecular signals involved in the formation of
  EMT. This reversal is called mesenchymal to epithelial transition. Various signaling
  molecules are involved in the transition between epithelial to mesenchymal phenotype.
  E-cadherin is one of the major signaling molecules that contribute to the maintenance
  of cell-cell adhesion. Cancer cells with less E-cadherin expression losses the adhesion
  properties of tumor that allows it to invade to near surrounding areas. -catenin
  is another important structural component of the adhesion complex. E-cadherin/-catenin
  binding is essential for the cells to adhere one another. Most invasive breast carcinoma
  display lower expression levels of E-cadherin  and the phosphorylated active form
  of -catenin in the nucleus ; this indicates that dissociation of E-cadherin/-catenin
  complex may be a way to thwart TNBC. Researchers have identified different genes
  as downstream effectors of -catenin, and of these, c-Myc and cyclin D1 are the main
  target genes. Myc is highly expressed in TNBC subtype, which influences the tumor
  growth, metastasis, and chemotherapy resistance. Similarly cyclin D1 is highly expressed
  in various cancers, and higher levels of this gene are associated with poor prognosis
  of breast cancer. Therefore, we were interested to learn about the effects of flavonoids
  on EMT process, -catenin signaling and its target genes in TNBC.


  Our present study describes the possible utilization of flavonoid compound against
  the higher EMT process that occurs in TNBC cells. We wanted to find out if exposure
  to quercetin resulted in higher expression levels of E-cadherin, which might lead
  to the decreased EMT process. Decreased nuclear localization of -catenin by quercetin
  would further explain the action of quercetin in regulating the action of -catenin
  in TNBC. We also wanted to find out if quercetin is able to decrease the expression
  levels of -catenin target genes, such as cyclin D1 and c-Myc.


  TNBC cells, MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468, were purchased from ATCC. TNBC cells were
  grown in RPMI 1640  and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum  and 1% penicillin-streptomycin
  at 37C in 5% CO2. Quercetin and 3--2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide  were purchased
  from Sigma.


  MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells were harvested during the logarithmic growth phase.
  To study the effects of quercetin on cell proliferation and viability, MDA-MB-231
  and MDA-MB-468 cells  were plated in 96-well plates for 24 h. Cells were washed
  once with medium and treated with different concentration of quercetin  for 72 h.
  Then the cells were treated with 10 l MTT  for 4 h. Subsequently, solubilization
  reagent was added and incubated the solution overnight to completely dissolve the
  purple precipitate obtained from MTT. Microplate reader was used to test the absorbance  of
  each well at 570 nm and average values were obtained.


  Actively growing MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 TNBC cell lines were seeded at a density
  of 2.5  104 cells in cell culture dishes and 24 h later, the cells were exposed
  to vehicle or different concentrations of quercetin. Cell proliferation was assessed
  every 24 h by counting viable cells using haemocytometer with Trypan blue staining.
  The cell counts were recorded and presented as a quantitative graphic representation.


  MDA-MB-468 cells were cultured to approximately 90% confluent, a small pipette tip
  was used to make a scratch in the monolayer of vehicle or quercetin treated cells.
  Cell migration was captured using bright field microscope and quantified by measuring
  the unclosed area in the middle of the scratch after the cells migrates towards
  the center from both sides. Wound repair was calculated over control.


  Quercetin treated  MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells  were seeded in Boyden chambers
  containing matrigel or no matrigel. Complete growth medium was added to the wells
  as the chemo-attractant. Boyden chambers were placed in wells containing complete
  medium. The migrated/invaded cells on the lower surface of the membrane were counter
  stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Cells were scored with a fluorescent
  microscope and the images were taken at 20x magnification. Cell migration/invasion
  was calculated over control. Boyden chambers with matrigel were used for invasion
  and no matrigel were used for cell migration assays.


  Quercetin or vehicle treated cells were fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS for
  15 min, cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X100 for 5 min. Cells were blocked
  for 1 h using 5% goat serum contain 3% BSA. Then, cells were incubated with the
  primary antibodies for 1 h followed by incubation with the fluorochrome-labeled
  secondary antibody for 30 min at room temperature. Nuclei were stained with 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole   for
  10 min. Membrane staining was carried out using wheat germ agglutinin. Slides were
  mounted with Fluoromount G  mounting medium and images were captured using Leica
  DMI 6000B fluorescence microscope.


  Quercetin or vehicle treated cells were lysed in RIPA buffer  containing protease
  inhibitor cocktail for mammalian cells. Lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for
  10 min and the protein concentration of supernatant  was determined using the BCA
  assay kit. For -catenin experiment, cytosolic and nuclear fraction was prepared
  using Epiquick nuclear extraction kit. Equal amounts of protein were resolved by
  SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred nitrocellulose membrane  by semi-dry transfer,
  blocked with 5% skim milk powder in PBS/0.1% Tween 20 and incubated overnight at
  4C with different diluted  primary antibodies. Membranes were washed three times
  with PBST and then incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies  for 1 h at
  room temperature. Visualization was performed by use of Amersham ECL plus Western
  blotting detection system. Chemiluminescence images were analyzed and densitometric
  measurements were carried out using the Image-J software.


  Total RNA was isolated using Qiagen RNAeasy kit. Equal amount of RNA from quercetin
  or vehicle treated cells were reverse transcribed using Verzo cDNA kit. qRT-PCR
  was carried out using Taqman gene expression assay of E-cadherin, c-Myc and cyclin
  D1.


  Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism  software. All the data
  were analyzed for statistical significance using Students t-test/ one-way ANOVA.
  For all experiments, P ; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.


  A considerable attention has been recently made to identify the anti-carcinogenic
  effect of different flavonoids. However the mechanism of action of anti-carcinogenic
  activity of quercetin in TNBC is not yet elucidated. We used two TNBC cell lines,
  MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468, for our studies. Initially, we investigated whether exposing
  these two cell lines to different concentrations of quercetin  affected anti-proliferation
  activity. Quercetin significantly decreased the survival of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468
  cells in a dose dependent manner. Further to study whether the decreased cell survival
  may be due to the decreased proliferation, cell growth analysis was carried out
  to assess the quercetin-dependent cell proliferation in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468
  cells in a time and dose dependent manner. The results obtained from the efficacy
  of quercetin on cell proliferation assay were consistent with its effect on cell
  survival data. Quercetin significantly inhibited the proliferation of MDA-MB-231
  and MDA-MB-468 cells to a greater extent compared to vehicle treated control cells
  in different periods of the experiment.

  to various concentrations of quercetin. Each data represent the mean  SD from three
  independent experiments P &lt; 0.05, P &lt; 0.01, P &lt; 0.001.


  Metastatic process of breast cancer is associated with rearrangement of cytoskeletal
  proteins and that result in cell morphology changes. MDA-MB-468 cells are highly
  aggressive TNBC cells, and were used to analyze the efficacy of quercetin on the
  alteration of cellular morphology. Quercetin treatment changed the fibroblast spindle-like
  shape of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells to cobblestone epithelial phenotype. This
  change in morphology was initiated by treating the cells with 10 M quercetin for
  24 h. This observation was very evident with 50 M quercetin treatment in both MDA-MB-231
  and MDA-MB-468 cells. The morphological changes induced by quercetin were also observed
  when cells were cultured in higher density, indicating that change in cell shape
  in quercetin treated samples is not due to the cytotoxic effect of quercetin.


  Figure 2\. Quercetin alters cell morphology and inhibits cell migration and invasion.  Bright
  field microscopic images of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells exposed to quercetin,  Microscopic
  images  and analysis  of wound healing assay in MDA-MB-468 cells treated with quercetin,
  and  Microscopic images  and analysis  of cell invasion assay of MDA-MB-231 and
  MDA-MB-468 in response to quercetin. Each data represent the mean  SD from three
  independent experiments and P &lt; 0.05, P &lt; 0.01, P &lt; 0.001.


  The metastatic potential of breast cancer cells can be assessed by measuring cell
  motility. The wound healing assay was used to measure the efficacy of quercetin
  on the motility of MDA-MB-468 cells. A wound was created by scratching confluent
  monolayers of MDA-MB-468 cells treated with quercetin  or vehicle. Control cells
  repaired the wound within 24 h of culture, whereas quercetin treatment significantly  reduced
  the wound healing cell compared to vehicle. This experiment established that quercetin
  could interfere with the cell motility of TNBC.


  To confirm this observation, we further carried out the invasion studies through
  the basement membrane. The invasive potential of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells
  treated with quercetin was analyzed in a Boyden chamber coated with extracellular
  matrix  and using 10% FBS as a chemoattractant. MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells
  treated with quercetin for 24 h exhibited a significant  decrease in the migration
  ability relative to vehicle-treated cells. These results confirmed that the quercetin
  has a significant effect in inhibiting invasive ability of TNBC cells. Further,
  to examine the mechanism underlying the cell invasion and altering the mesenchymal
  morphology of TNBC, we analyzed the impact of quercetin on different signaling molecules
  in TNBC cells.


  The above data suggested that quercetin is able to alter the spindle-shaped mesenchymal
  morphology of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells to epithelial phenotype. Vimentin
  is generally used as an EMT marker, and during MET, vimentin protein and mRNA expression
  is downregulated. Experiments were carried out to analyze whether quercetin is able
  to down regulate the vimentin expression level in MDA-MB-231 cells. As expected,
  Western blot analysis revealed a significant decrease in the vimentin protein expression
  level. Immunofluorescence analysis was also carried out to measure the vimentin
  expression level and the proper visualization of mesenchymal transition to epithelial
  morphology. The lesser fluorescence in the quercetin treated sample indicated that
  the expression level of vimentin is significantly lower compared to the control.
  The transition of spindle shaped mesenchymal phenotype to cobblestone epithelial
  cell morphology by quercetin treatment was very evident from immunofluorescence
  analysis.

  determined by qRT-PCR using Taqman gene expression assay system. Histograms represent
  the relative mRNA expression level of E-cadherin normalized to GAPDH mRNA levels.

  Loss of expression of epithelial adherence junction protein is a biochemical hallmark
  of mesenchymal transition. Loss of E-cadherin in combination with the appearance
  of spindle cell morphology is associated with EMT in breast cancer cells. Expression
  level of E-cadherin is very low in MDA-MB-231 cells compared to the primary breast
  cancer model. Here, we investigated whether the quercetin-induced epithelial transition
  of MDA-MB-231 cells were associated with alteration of E-cadherin expression level.
  Our results showed that quercetin  significantly increased the E-cadherin expression
  compared to vehicle treated cells, nine fold increase in mRNA expression  and 10-fold
  higher protein expression was observed by qRT-PCR  and Western blot analysis, respectively.
  These results confirmed that quercetin has a significant impact on vimentin and
  E-cadherin levels.


  From the above data, it is clear that quercetin has significant effect in regulating
  the migratory ability of TNBC. It is essential to identify various signaling molecules
  that are regulated by quercetin and that contribute to the transition of the mesenchymal
  phenotype to the epithelial shape. It has been established that wnt/-catenin pathway
  activation triggers EMT and leads to cancer cell invasion. Of the many signaling
  molecules associated with the wnt/-catenin pathway, -catenin is the downstream transcriptional
  activator responsible for transmitting the cytoplasmic cellular signals into the
  nucleus, which leads to the activation of various target genes. Therefore we examined
  the expression and subcellular localization of -catenin in quercetin treated MDA-MB-231
  cells.


  Our immunofluorescence analysis of MDA-MB-231 cells showed the nuclear localization
  of -catenin in vehicle treated cells, whereas the major -catenin localization was
  observed in the cytoplasm of quercetin treated cells. Result observed with MDA-MB-231
  was further confirmed by Western blot analysis using nuclear and cytoplasmic cellular
  fractions. Quercetin-treated MDA-MB-231 cells exhibited higher cytoplasmic -catenin
  expression level, whereas the nuclear fraction of vehicle treated cells showed higher
  -catenin expression level. These results indicated that the quercetin degraded the
  nuclear -catenin and led to the inactivation of -catenin downstream signaling.


  Figure 4\. Cellular localization of -catenin is altered by quercetin treatment.  MDA-MB-231
  cells treated with quercetin  for 24 h and stained the cells with -catenin, DAPI  and
  wheat germ agglutinin, and  Western blot analysis of cytosolic and nuclear fraction
  of 24 h quercetin treated  was carried out using -catenin antibody. Histogram shows
  the densitometric analysis of relative expression levels of cytosolic and nuclear
  -catenin to -actin. Error bars represent standard deviation of three independent
  experiments and P &lt; 0.05, P &lt; 0.01, P &lt; 0.001.


  The above data suggested that quercetin diminishes the activity of -catenin in MDA-MB-231
  cells. -catenin is involved in the transcriptional activation of different target
  genes such as cyclin D1, c-Myc, and metalloproteinase-2 by releasing the inhibition
  of TCF/lymphoid enhancer factor. We determined the effect of quercetin treatment
  on expression levels of cyclin D1 and c-Myc in MDA-MB-231 cells. Results showed
  that 24 h treatment of quercetin significantly decreased the mRNA and protein expression
  level of cyclin D1  and c-Myc  by qRT-PCR analysis. It has been reported that cyclin
  D1 is localized predominantly in the nucleus of growing cells  and is associated
  with chemotherapy resistance and cancer cell migration in various cancers including
  ovarian cancer. Studies suggested that GSK3- plays a significant role in the degradation
  rate of cyclin D1.


  Figure 5\. Quercetin enhances cyclin D1 and c-Myc and decreases Akt phosphorylation
  of TNBC. Real time PCR analysis of cyclin D1  and c-Myc  in MDA-MB-231 cells treated
  with 10 or 50 M of quercetin for 24 h. mRNA expression levels of cyclin D1 and c-Myc
  in MDA-MB-231 cells treated with 10 or 50 M quercetin for 24 h was determined by
  qRT-PCR using Taqman gene expression assay system. Histograms represent the relative
  mRNA expression level of cyclin D1 and c-Myc normalized to GAPDH mRNA levels, and  Western
  blot analysis of Akt phosphorylation in MDA-MB-231 cells treated with 10 or 50 M
  concentration of quercetin for 6 h. Histogram shows the densitometric analysis of
  relative expression levels of phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated Akt. Error bars
  represent standard deviation of three independent experiments and P &lt; 0.05, P
  &lt; 0.01, P &lt; 0.001.


  Studies have established that Akt is the major signaling molecule regulating the
  activity of GSK3-. Therefore, we carried out experiments to study the effect of
  quercetin on Akt phosphorylation of MDA-MB-231 cells. Western blot analysis showed
  that quercetin  significantly decreased the phosphorylation of Akt in the above-mentioned
  TNBC cells. MDA-MB-231 cells exhibit approximately threefold reduction in Akt phosphorylation  followed
  by 6 h of quercetin  treatment.


  Recent reports have suggested that PI3K/Akt mediated cell motility enhances the
  progression of cancer metastasis, also the cross talk between PI3K/Akt and TGF-/Smad
  pathway stimulate cell migration  and enhance cancer cell metastasis. Our studies
  revealed that quercetin regulated the Akt signaling in TNBC cells and led to the
  regulation of different downstream signaling pathway such as cyclin D1 and -catenin.


  Previous studies suggested that in other cancer cells, quercetin potentiates doxorubicin
  mediated anti-tumor effects. To test whether quercetin enhances the anti-carcinogenic
  effect of doxorubicin, we carried out a Boyden chamber migration assay in MDA-MB-231
  and MDA-MB-468 cells treated with different concentrations  of doxorubicin. Our
  studies revealed that 0.1 M doxorubicin significantly  decreased the migration of
  both TNBC cell lines; however the migratory ability was not decreased with 0.5 M
  concentration. A similar observation was also reported by other investigators regarding
  doxorubicin and other chemotherapy drugs. Further, migration studies were assessed
  to analyze the ability of quercetin to decrease the invasion in cells treated with
  doxorubicin. Quercetin significantly decreased the migration in cells treated with
  both MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468.


  Figure 6\. Doxorubicin is not effective to inhibit the migration of MDA-MB-231 cells.  Migration
  assay was carried out in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells treated with different
  concentrations of doxorubicin and quercetin  for 24 h. Histogram represent the number
  of cells migrated through the porous membrane in vehicle treated and different treatment
  conditions,  qRT-PCR analysis of TGF-1 in MDA-MB-231 cells treated with different
  concentrations of doxorubicin, and  mRNA expression levels of TGF-1 in MDA-MB-231
  cells treated with doxorubicin  and quercetin  for 24 h was determined by qRT-PCR
  using Taqman gene expression assay system. Histograms represent the relative mRNA
  expression level of TGF-1 normalized to GAPDH mRNA levels. Error bars represent
  standard deviation of three independent experiments and P &lt; 0.05, P &lt; 0.01,
  P &lt; 0.001.


  Available reports have suggested that alteration of TGF- signaling is one of the
  major causative factors that block the effect of chemotherapy on breast cancer migration.
  To test whether doxorubicin altered TGF- signaling, we treated MDA-MB-231 cells
  with different concentrations of doxorubicin and analyzed the expression level of
  TGF-1 by qRT-PCR analysis. Studies revealed that lower concentration of doxorubicin  significantly  reduced
  TGF-1 level, whereas 0.5 M concentration of doxorubicin significantly enhanced the
  TGF-1 mRNA expression.


  Further, we carried out combination treatment of doxorubicin and quercetin in MDA-MB-231
  in order to analyze the effect of quercetin to inhibit this TGF-1 signaling as well
  as the migratory potential of doxorubicin. Quercetin decreased the TGF-1 signaling  and
  also enhanced the ability of doxorubicin to decrease the migratory potential of
  TNBC. These results suggested that quercetin is able to decrease the TGF-1 signaling
  in doxorubicin-treated TNBC and may contribute to decreased cell migration.


  TNBC has most of the characteristics of basal-like and claudin-low sub types, therefore
  genomic alterations in basal-like and claudin-low subtypes of breast cancer were
  analyzed using cBioportal of cancer genomics. Analysis was focused on E-cadherin,
  cyclin D1, c-Myc, -catenin and vimentin, which are significantly regulated in our
  experiments by quercetin treatment. E-cadherin, an EMT marker is down regulated  in
  claudin-low subtypes while 5% alteration in basal-like subtypes. Another EMT marker
  vimentin is upregulated in both basal-like and claudin-low patient samples. Upregulation
  of -catenin mRNA was observed in basal-like subtype. Notably, 35% alteration including
  gene amplification and mRNA upregulation was observed for c-Myc in basal-like subtypes
  while there was no alteration in claudin-low subtypes. These observations indicate
  that the quercetin altered genes such as E-cadherin, cyclin D1, c-Myc, -catenin
  and vimentin have significant implication in basal-like and claudin-low patients
  and modification of these genes may have beneficial effect to diminish TNBC metastasis.

  data of 81 breast cancer basal-like subtype  and 8 breast cancer claudin-low subtype  were
  extracted and used to generate an oncoprint plot using the cBio Cancer Genomics
  Portal. The results presented here are in whole or part based upon data generated
  by the TCGA Research Network. Each row represents a gene, and each column represents
  a tumor sample. Red bars indicate gene amplifications, blue bars are homozygous
  deletions, and green squares are nonsynonymous mutations.


  In the present study, we revealed the effect of a flavonoid on the migratory ability
  of TNBC cells. Previous studies suggested that quercetin, one of the major flavonoids
  present in fruits and vegetables, exerts its anti-tumor effect by decreasing the
  proliferative and migratory potential of TNBC cells. However, approximately 20%
  of TNBCs lack basal-like markers such as cytokeratin  5/6, CK 14, CK 17, and EGFR.
  Targeted therapy for metastatic breast cancer has been not sensitive to TNBC due
  to the lack of cell surface receptors. Further studies are warranted to identify
  new targets and new therapies that inhibit the metastatic ability of TNBC.


  EMT happens in normal developmental and physiological processes, such as embryogenesis
  and wound healing respectively. During this transformation, cobblestone-shaped epithelial
  cells change morphology and lose the ability of cell-cell attachment, resulting
  in the mesenchymal spindle-shaped cells. Also, EMT allows the migration of cancer
  cells by unravelling the cancer cells from primary tumor site. Different molecular
  signaling processes are associated with EMT transformation. Of these alterations,
  E-cadherin loss is one of the most significant characteristics of EMT in breast
  cancer metastasis. The oncoprint analysis also showed the down regulation of E-cadherin
  in some of the basal-like and claudin-low sub types. Western blot and qRT-PCR showed
  that quercetin significantly increased the E-cadherin expression in TNBC cells.
  In most of the metastatic cancer cells, E-cadherin loss is associated with higher
  expression of vimentin. Upregulation of vimentin was observed in oncoprint analysis
  of patient samples and also in MDA-MB-231 cells. Our studies suggested that the
  vimentin level is markedly decreased by quercetin treatment. Immunofluorescence
  analysis of vimentin further confirms the ability of quercetin to induce the epithelial
  transition of TNBC cells. In agreement with these results, a recent report suggested
  that flavonoids inhibit invadopodia formation in A431-III cells.


  Various studies have demonstrated that the alteration in -catenin pathway influences
  the migration of breast cancer. Breast cancer sample oncoprint analysis also indicates
  higher -catenin expression level in basal-like cancer subtypes. The abnormal accumulation
  and nuclear translocation of -catenin is associated with oncogenic activation. The
  active form of -catenin can bind to TCF/lymphoid enhancer factor  and enhances the
  target genes such as c-Myc, MMP-2, and cyclin D1. Also, oncoprint of breast cancer
  patient samples revealed higher expression of c-Myc in basal-like breast cancer
  subtypes, this subtype is most closely related to TNBC. Immunohistochemical analysis
  of patient material suggested higher nuclear expression levels of -catenin in TNBC
  samples.


  Also, the increased nuclear -catenin level was associated with poor clinical outcome
  of TNBC. In agreement with these reports, our immunofluorescence analysis showed
  nuclear localization of -catenin in MDA-MDB-231cells. Quercetin treatment decreased
  the nuclear localization of -catenin and that resulted into the cytosolic localization
  of -catenin. E-cadherin is one of the molecules that play a critical role in stabilizing
  -catenin, by E-cadherin/-catenin complex formation. This complex formation is essential
  for cell-cell adhesion and for maintenance of the epithelial phenotype. Loss of
  E-cadherin may be one of the reasons for the nuclear localization of -catenin in
  TNBC. Quercetin is able to modulate the expression level of E-cadherin and this
  contributes to the decreased level of nuclear localization of -catenin. This alteration
  by quercetin may have resulted in decreased activation of LEF/TCF transcription
  factors, leading to decreased activation of genes such as cyclin D1 and c-Myc. Decreased
  expression of levels these genes were confirmed in quercetin-treated TNBC cells.
  Furthermore, c-Myc was found to be elevated in patient oncoprint analysis. Nuclear
  localized cyclin D1 has been shown to enhance tumor formation. Our results suggested
  that regulating -catenin pathway by quercetin inhibits the downstream oncogenic
  signaling cascades in TNBC.


  The nuclear translocation of cyclin D1 is due to the phosphorylation at Thr286 by
  GSK-3, the cytosolic fraction of cyclin D1 that undergoes proteosomal degradation
  by the ubiquitination pathway. Cyclin D1 is regulated by nuclear accumulation and
  stabilization through Akt phosphorylation-induced inhibition of GSK-3. Therefore,
  Akt plays a significant role in cyclin D1 cellular localization status in TNBC.
  Our study revealed that treatment of quercetin inhibited the phosphorylation status
  of Akt in MDA-MB- 231 cells. This result defines the variation in cellular localization
  of cyclin D1 in quercetin-treated cells. Reduced cyclin D1 nuclear localization
  may regulate EMT, because cyclin D1 is able to reduce cell attachment and induce
  breast cancer cell migration. Studies have also suggested that cyclin D1 activity
  is essential for the self-renewal of mammary stem and progenitor cells.


  Various available reports are supportive regarding the role of c-Myc in the regulation
  of metastatic phenotype. It is established that Myc is highly expressed in basal-like
  tumors compared to luminal and Her2 overexpressing tumors. Myc regulates the invasion
  and migration of cells by collaborating with other oncogenic pathways. This study
  suggested that Myc and cyclin D1, the two -catenin target genes, are downregulated
  by quercetin in TNBC. This downregulation may be one of the reasons for the inhibition
  of cell migration.


  Our findings indicated that quercetin inhibits EMT by regulating different signaling
  molecules that are involved in the formation of mesenchymal phenotype. Furthermore,
  to confirm quercetin-mediated inhibition of TNBC motility, doxorubicin-treated cells
  are used as experimental model. Doxorubicin is an anthracycline drug and is one
  of the major drugs used as a chemotherapy drug to treat TNBC. However, some studies
  have suggested that treatment with doxorubicin induces migration and invasion of
  breast cancer. We identified that lower concentrations of doxorubicin  inhibit the
  migration of MDA-MB-231 cells, whereas higher concentrations is not able to inhibit
  migratory ability of TNBC cells.


  Previous studies indicated that activation of TGF- signaling is one of the mechanisms
  behind the enhancement of migration by doxorubicin. We confirmed this finding and
  observed that cells treated with 0.5 M doxorubicin significantly enhanced the expression
  level of TGF-1 levels. The co-treatment with doxorubicin and quercetin decreased
  TGF-1 activation and prevented the migration of MDA-MB-231 cells. Studies also suggested
  that quercetin potentiates the effect of doxorubicin in drug resistant MCF-7 breast
  cancer cell line, liver cancer cells. Recurrence of cancer after chemotherapy or
  radiotherapy is very common in TNBC patients. In this context, further studies are
  needed to confirm that the recurrence of TNBC after chemotherapy could be avoided
  by combination treatment of doxorubicin and quercetin in order to enhance the doxorubicin
  effect in TNBC. In conclusion our studies suggest that the quercetin inhibits the
  increased migration ability of TNBC. Quercetin is able to regulate EMT markers such
  as E-cadherin and vimentin in aggressive TNBC cells. Furthermore, quercetin is effective
  in regulating active -catenin signaling. Also, the quercetin is capable of inhibiting
  TGF-1 induced by higher concentration of doxorubicin. Further studies will be needed
  to learn more about whether the combination treatment of quercetin and doxorubicin
  would be a beneficial treatment for TNBC. Studies will also be planned to develop
  different quercetin analogues to enhance its bioavailability and the biological
  activity of these derivatives will be compared with parent molecule.


  Anti-tumor activity of quercetin was recorded in various pre-clinical and clinical
  trials. Studies identified that dietary supplementation of quercetin decreased the
  growth of orthotopic pancreatic tumors in a nude mouse model. A quercetin analogue
  3,4,5-trimethoxyflavonol inhibited tumor development in ApcMin mice and human-derived
  HCT116 adenocarcinoma-bearing nude mice. A recent study on dose-dependent effects
  of quercetin on tumorigenesis in a C3/SV40 Tag transgenic breast cancer model reported
  reduced tumor volume in moderate dose  administered group compared to high  and
  low dose. Few studies on quercetin were prolonged up to human clinical trial level.
  A phase 1 clinical trial studied the anti-proliferative and pharmacokinetics effects
  of quercetin in cancer patients and observed the tyrosine kinase inhibition and
  anti-tumor activity. The toxicity studies from this trial also revealed that the
  higher dose of quercetin induced nephrotoxicity. Recent studies have identified
  that quercetin increases the bioavailability and chemo preventive action of green
  tea in prostate cancer pre-clinical models. Further, these studies are extended
  to confirm quercetins ability to enhance the uptake of green tea in patients undergoing
  radical prostatectomy. Another clinical trial is currently evaluating the efficacy
  of genistein and quercetin in comparison with a placebo on the rate of increase
  in the prostate-specific antigen. Early observations from this study showed an inverse
  relationship between genistein intake and PSA levels in patients with higher PSA
  levels. The available pre-clinical and clinical data suggest that the moderate dose
  of quercetin is less toxic and effective as an anti-tumor agent. Additionally, quercetin
  showed significant influence in inducing the bioavailability of other dietary constituents
  in preclinical and clinical studies. The future studies will be focused on anti-tumor
  activity of quercetin with existing chemotherapeutic drugs in inhibiting the migratory
  ability of TNBC in animal model.
