  sativus L saffron for cancer chemoprevention A mini review.md
text: '


  Cancer is one of the most feared diseases globally and there has been a sustained
  rise in its incidence in both developing and developed countries. Despite the growing
  therapeutic options for patients with cancer, their efficacy is time-limited and
  non-curative. Hence to overcome these drawbacks, an incessant screening for superior
  and safer drugs has been ongoing for numerous decades, resulting in the detection
  of anti-cancer properties of several phytochemicals. Chemoprevention using readily
  available natural substances from vegetables, fruits, herbs and spices is one of
  the significantly important approaches for cancer prevention in the present era.
  Among the spices, Crocus sativus L.  has generated interest because pharmacological
  experiments have established numerous beneficial properties including radical scavenging,
  anti-mutagenic and immuno-modulating effects. The more powerful components of saffron
  are crocin, crocetin and safranal. Studies in animal models and with cultured human
  malignant cell lines have demonstrated antitumor and cancer preventive activities
  of saffron and its main ingredients. This review provides a brief insight into the
  anticancer properties of saffron and its components.'
