  It was well known that the clinical use of chemotherapeutic drugs is restricted
  by severe adverse reactions and drug resistances. Thus it is necessary to figure
  out a strategy to increase the specific anti-tumor efficiency of chemotherapeutic
  drugs. Apigenin, a kind of flavonoids, has been reported to possess anticancer activities
  with very low cytotoxicity to normal tissue.




  Our results from cell viability assay, western-blots and TdT-mediated dUTP-biotin
  nick end labeling assay demonstrated the synergistic pro-apoptotic effects of a
  low dose of apigenin and paclitaxel in human cancer cell lines. To analyze the underlying
  mechanism, we examined reactive oxygen species staining after cells were treated
  with a combination of apigenin and paclitaxel, or each of them alone. Data from
  flow-cytometry showed that superoxides but not reduction of peroxides accumulated
  in HeLa cells treated with apigenin or a combination of apigenin and paclitaxel.
  Apigenin and paclitaxel-induced HeLa cell apoptosis was related to the level of
  ROS in cells. We further evaluated activity and protein level of superoxide dismutase.
  Apigenin significantly inhibited SOD activity but did not alter the SOD protein
  level suggesting that apigenin promoted ROS accumulation through suppressing enzyme
  activity of SOD. Addition of Zn2+, Cu2+ and Mn2+ to cell lysates inhibited apigenins
  effects on SOD activity. At the same time, data from caspase-2 over-expression and
  knocked-down experiments demonstrated that caspase-2 participated in apigenin and
  paclitaxel-induced HeLa cell apoptosis.




  Taken together, our study demonstrated that apigenin can sensitize cancer cells
  to paclitaxel induced apoptosis through suppressing SOD activity, which then led
  to accumulation of ROS and cleavage of caspase-2, suggesting that the combined use
  of apigenin and paclitaxel was an effective way to decrease the dose of paclitaxel
  taken.

  Chemotherapy is one of the most widely employed treatments for cancer. However many
  chemotherapeutic drugs can produce unpleasant side effects,especially when taken
  in high doses. One of the chemotherapeutic drugs, paclitaxel, a mitotic inhibitor,
  may lead to hypersensitivity reactions , neutropenia , neurotoxicity , cardiac rhythm
  disorder  and other miscellaneous toxic effects , which seriously worsens the quality
  of life of cancer patients and results in dosage reduction and discontinuation of
  treatment. It is therefore important to decrease the adverse side effects of chemotherapeutic
  agents in clinical treatment of cancer. In addition, drug resistance in clinical
  therapy often interferes with the efficiency of chemotherapeutic agents.


  Reactive oxygen species including superoxide radical, hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl
  radical, nitric oxide, and various nitric oxide-derived reactive nitro species are
  formed as natural byproducts of normal metabolism of oxygen in human cells and tissues.
  Because of their highly reactive character, they tend to become involved in unwanted
  reactions that cause damage to cells and ultimately lead to diseases. Cancer cells
  exhibit increased glycolysis in combination with a reduced rate of respiration and
  these alterations in metabolism have been shown to be associated with enhanced oxidative
  stress –. A high cell redox status could stimulate tumor formation through creating
  an enhanced cell-proliferative environment, inducing DNA damage, and turning off
  tumor suppression functions , . Tumor growth and migration could be inhibited in
  vitro by alteration of the environment around tumor cells to a more reducing one.
  In opposition to this, a high cell redox state would also support increased apoptosis,
  which would inhibit tumor formation. Thus, in cancer cells, the high redox state
  could enhance their tolerance to environmental stresses and chemotherapeutic drugs.
  Tumor cells expressed a higher level of MnSOD indicate a poor prognosis , . It has
  been shown that ROS have potential ability to process caspase-2 ,  which is an initiator
  caspase led to mitochondrial membrane permeabilization  and is also an important
  member in apoptosis signal amplification loop . Besides, previous studies in caspase-2
  knocked-out mice have shown that caspase-2 activation was related with ROS accumulation
  . Reduced apoptosis rate was also detected in caspase-2−/− oocytes .


  Apigenin is widely contained in many fruits and vegetables. Recently, it was reported
  that apigenin had a potential anti-tumor effects on several human cancer cell lines
  with low cytotoxicity and no mutagenic activity. –. Apigenin could enhance the intracellular
  accumulation of ROS and had the pro-oxidant potential ,  and decrease SOD activity
  in lung cancer cells .


  In the present work, we demonstrated that apigenin could sensitize cancer cells
  to paclitaxel induced apoptosis through suppressing SOD activity and leading to
  accumulation of ROS and cleavage of caspase-2, suggesting the combined use of apigenin
  and paclitaxel was effective for cancer therapy.

  using Guava® TUNEL Kit as previously described . The cells were detected on a Guava
  EasyCyte™ System, and data were analyzed by using Guava TUNEL Software. All assays
  were performed for three replicates.




  Annexin V/PI assay, by using annexin V/PI double staining of unfixed cells, distinguishes
  between early apoptotic cells and late apoptotic/necrotic cells. Both floated and
  attached cells were suspended in 500 µl binding buffer. Annexin V-FITC and PI was

  give x% inhibition, whereas in the numerators,1 and2 are the doses of apigenin and
  paclitaxel used in combination that isoeffectively inhibit x%. CI;1, CI = 1, and
  CI&gt;1 suggest synergism, additive and antagonism, respectively.

  significance of variance pair-wise comparison. In all analyses, P&lt;0.05 was considered
  as statistically significant.






  Since toxicity of paclitaxel is coupled to its antitumor activity and apigenin has
  been reported to have antitumor activity with low toxicity, we first observed the
  co-effects of comcination paclitaxel with apigenin. HeLa cells were treated with
  various doses of apigenin, paclitaxel or both of them and then the cell viabilities
  were detected. As shown in Fig. 1A and B, both apigenin and paclitaxel dose dependently
  induced cytotoxicity with approximately 29% reduction of cell viability induced
  by apigenin at the dose of 25 µM and 24% reduction induced by paclitaxel at the
  dose of 10 nM respectively. When we treated HeLa cells with 15 µM apigenin and 4
  nM paclitaxel, over 50% decrease of cell viability was detected, nevertheless, less
  than 20% decrease of cell viability was observed in cells treated with apigenin
  or paclitaxel respectively. We carried out Chou-Talalay calculation to confirm the
  synergistic effects of apigenin and paclitaxel on HeLa cells. The combination index
  was 0.3918±0.0436 at the dose of 15 µM apigenin and 4 nM paclitaxel indicating synergistic
  effects of apigenin and paclitaxel. These results indicated a significantly increased
  cytotoxicity when apigenin and paclitaxel were administrated to HeLa cells simultaneously.
  Also shown in Fig. 1C, combination of apigenin with paclitaxel induced the similar
  results in the cancer cells other than Hela cells including Hep3B and A549 cells.
  However, 15 µM apigenin, 4 nM paclitaxel or combination of them did not result in
  cytotoxicity to HEK293A cells respectively. These data suggested there were synergistic
  effects of apigenin and paclitaxel for specifically killing cancer cells






  Figure 1.  Apigenin and paclitaxel enhance cytotoxicity to cancer cells compared
  with paclitaxel.


  A, HeLa cells were treated with increased concentrations of apigenin for 24 hours.
  Cell vitality was measured. The experiment was independently repeated for three
  times and data were shown as mean ± SD. B, HeLa cells were treated with increased
  concentrations of paclitaxel for 24 hours. Cell vitality was detected and analyzed
  as described in A. C, HeLa, A549, Hep3B and HEK293A cells were subjected to treatment
  with apigenin combination with paclitaxel for 24 hours. Cell vitality was detected
  as described in A. D, HeLa cells were treated with apigenin or paclitaxel respectively,
  besides, in other groups, apigenin was added to HeLa cells 2 hours before or after
  paclitaxel treatment, or apigenin and paclitaxel were added to HeLa cells at the
  same time. TUNEL staining was performed and detected with a Guava® TUNEL Kit. Numbers
  depicted the percentage of TUNEL-positive cells. E, Cells were either left untreated
  or treated as previously described in D. At the indicated time, cells were stained
  with annexin V/PI dye. Analyses were conducted on 5,000 cells in each trail. F,
  HeLa cells were treated with increased concentrations of apigenin or paclitaxel
  respectively, or both of them for 24 hours. Then the cell lysates were subjected
  to Western blot to determine protein level of caspase-3 and PARP. V represents vehicle.

  It has been reported that both paclitaxel ,  and apigenin  can induce cell apoptosis.
  We next verify whether combination use of apigenin and paclitaxel could induce more
  acute apoptosis in HeLa cells. Compared to those groups treated with apigenin or
  paclitaxel individually, apigenin and paclitaxel co-treated groups showed more TUNEL
  positive staining cells. The rates of TUNEL positive staining cells were notably
  increased from 17.95% in paclitacel treated group and 19.65% of apigenin treated
  group to around 40% in the groups treated by combination of them. To quantify apoptosis,
  FACS analysis was carried out after staining cells with FITC-annexin-V plus propidium
  iodide. Data shown in Fig. 1E indicated that the number of surviving cells decreased
  gradually after co-treatment with apigenin and paclitaxel and only less than 60%
  were survived 24 hours after apigenin and paclitaxel treatment.


  Since activation of caspases is an important reason for apoptosis, we further detected
  the cleavages of caspase-3 and PARP using western blot analysis. As shown in Fig.
  1F, both the cleavages of caspase-3 and PARP were significantly enhanced by apigenin/paclitaxel
  co-treatment compared with apigenin or paclitaxel treatment alone. These results
  confirmed that apigenin/paclitaxel co-treatment induced a significant apoptotic
  death of HeLa cells suggesting that combination use of apigenin and paclitaxel would
  produce a better anti-tumor effect than use of apigenin or paclitaxel alone.




  Meanwhile flavonoids including apigenin were widely recognized as the antioxidants,
  their pro-oxidant properties have also been reported . We speculated the anticancer
  effects of combination apigenin/paclitaxel might be related with production of ROS
  in HeLa cells induced by apigenin. Therefore we observed the levels in HeLa cells
  treated with with apigenin, paclitaxel or both of them. Two ROS-specific dyes, DHE
  and CM-H2DCFDA displayed superoxide species and H2O2 in target cells respectively
  . CM-H2DCFDA is mainly oxidized by hydrogen peroxides and hydroxyl radical, DHE
  is oxidized by superoxide anions. HeLa cells were stained with DHE and CM-H2DCFDA
  followed by flow cytometry. As shown in Fig. 2, DHE-specific ROS increased whereas
  CM-H2DCFDA-specific ROS reduced in HeLa cells treated with apigenin within the 30
  minutes. No change was detected in the cells treated with paclitaxel alone. A similar
  trend and a more significant change in ROS status were observed in those cells treated
  with combination of apigenin and paclitaxel compared with cells treated with apigenin
  alone. DHE staining observed in these experiments resulted from the oxidation by
  superoxide species suggesting that apigenin increased superoxide specie related
  ROS in HeLa cells.







  A, HeLa cells were treated with apigenin alone or together with paclitaxel, for
  indicated periods. DHE was added into cell cultures 30 minutes before the treatment.
  DHE staining in cells were detected and analyzed by Guava EasyCyte™ System. DHE
  staining in untreated cells were used as the negative control. B, CM-H2DCFDA staining
  was performed and analyzed as described in A.



  Next we evaluated whether apigenin/paclitaxel-induced apoptosis was dependent on
  ROS accumulation. N-acetyl-L-cysteine, a well approved ROS scavenger, has been used
  to antagonize the effect of ROS. Pretreatment of HeLa cells with 100 µM NAC effectively
  suppressed the generation of superoxide species and significantly inhibited the
  cell apoptosis induced by apigenin and paclitaxel co-treatment. The above data suggested
  that ROS were essential for apigenin/paclitaxel-induced HeLa cell apoptosis.






  Figure 3.  ROS accumulation is required for apigenin/paclitaxel-triggered apoptosis
  A, HeLa cells were treated with ROS scavenger NAC for 2 hours or not, then stained
  with DHE, followed by the treatment with apigenin and paclitaxel for 60 minutes.


  Cells were then collected and detected by Guava EasyCyte™ System as described in
  Fig. 2A. B, HeLa cells were treated with NAC for 2 hours and then incubated with
  apigenin and paclitaxel for 24 hours. Cell apoptosis was measured by TUNEL assay
  as described in Fig. 1.





  We observed that after HeLa cells were treated with apigenin, the abundance of superoxide
  species increased whereas H2O2 decreased. Considering SOD was a cellular enzyme
  which can convert superoxide to H2O2, we speculated that apigenin might reduce the
  activity of SOD and consequently led to the accumulation of superoxide species.
  We then investigated the effect of apigenin on protein level as well as the enzyme
  activity of SOD. A significant suppression of both CuZnSOD and MnSOD activity was
  observed in HeLa cells within 30 minutes after apigenin or apigenin/paclitaxel but
  not paclitaxel treatment. However, there was no apparent change observed in the
  protein level of CuZnSOD and MnSOD after apigenin administration. Accordingly, it
  was evidential that apigenin suppressed SOD activity and thus induced the accumulation
  of ROS.






  Figure 4.  Suppression of SOD activity by apigenin is associated with metal ions
  in HeLa cells.


  A, HeLa cells were treated with apigenin, paclitaxel, or both of them for 30 minutes.
  SOD activity was measured with Cayman SOD detection kit. The experiment was independently
  repeated for three times and data were shown with mean±S.D. p&lt;0.05 compared with
  control group; p&lt;0.01 compared with control group. B, HeLa cells were treated
  with apigenin and paclitaxel for 30 minutes. Cell lysates were subjected to Western-blot
  Protein to determine levels of SOD1 and SOD2. C, HeLa cells were treated with apigenin
  for 30 minutes and lysed by sonication. Cell lysates were then incubated with CuCl2,
  ZnCl2 and MnCl2 for 30 minutes on ice. The SOD activity were measured and analyzed
  as described in A. D, HeLa cells were lysed by sonication and cell lysates were
  then incubated with above mentioned metal ions for 30 minutes on ice. SOD activity
  was measured as mentioned above. p&lt;0.05 compared with apigenin-treated group;
  p&lt;0.01 compared with apigenin-treated group.



  As above results showed that apigenin suppressed SOD activity, and it had been reported
  that apigenin could form stable complexation with metal ions in vitro , we thus
  determined if apigenin could form complexation with metal ions and suppress SOD
  activity through preventing SOD from assemble with its cofactors. HeLa cells were
  treated with 15 µM apigenin for 30 minutes and the lysates of cells were incubated
  with 8 µM of ZnCl2, CuCl2 or MnCl2 respectively on ice for another 30 minutes. The
  activity of SOD was measured using the Cayman Superoxide Dismutase Assay Kit as
  described in Material and Methods. As expected, apigenin significantly suppressed
  the activities of both CuZnSOD and MnSOD, but the activity CuZnSOD increased after
  Cu2+, Zn2+, and Mn2+ exposure and the activity of MnSOD also increased obviously
  after Mn2+ exposure. Additionally, no significant change of SOD activity was found
  when cell lysates were directly exposed to Cu2+, Zn2+ or Mn2+ without apigenin treatment,
  indicating that these metal ions did not enhance basal SOD activity.These results
  suggested that apigenin suppressed SOD activity probably through forming a stable
  complexation with those metals in cells , and apigenin might have higher binding
  affinity to Mn2+.




  Apigenin inhibited the activity of SOD and combination of apigenin/paclitaxel was
  more effective in inducing apoptosis of cancer cells than each of them alone. In
  order to confirm that apigenin-induced decrease of activity of SOD was critical
  in the apoptosis triggered by apigenin/paclitaxel co-treatment, we observed paclitaxel-induced
  apoptosis after blocking SOD enzyme activity. DETC, a well approved inhibitor of
  both CuZnSOD and MnSOD was applied in our present study . As similar as apigenin,
  DETC suppressed the activity of SOD and enhanced paclitaxel induced apoptosis as
  well. These data strongly suggested that reduction of SOD activity by apigenin is
  critical in the enhancement of paclitaxel-induced apoptosis.






  Figure 5.  Apigenin-induced ROS are required for cleavage of caspase-2, MMP and
  cell apoptosis.


  A, HeLa cells were incubated with apigenin/paclitaxel, or paclitaxel together with
  or without 1 mM DETC for 24 hours and then cells were subjected to TUNEL assay as
  described previously. B, HeLa cells were pretreated with NAC for 2 hours, followed
  by the treatment with apigenin and paclitaxel for 24 hours. Cleavage of caspase-2
  was detected by Western-blot analysis with the control of β-actin. C, HeLa cells
  were pretreated with z-VDVAD-fmk, a specific inhibitor of caspase-2, and then were
  treated with apigenin and paclitaxel for 24 hours. Protein levels of cleaved PARP
  and procaspase-3 were detected by Western-blot analysis. D, HeLa cells were pretreated
  with z-VDVAD-fmk for 30 minutes and then were treated with apigenin and paclitaxel
  for 8 hours. Cells were then harvested and mitochondrial membrane potential was
  detected using a Guava EasyCyte™ MitoPotential Kit and analyzed by Guava EasyCyte™
  System. MMP was showed as the count of depolarized cells. The experiment was independently
  repeated for three times and data were shown as mean±SD. p&lt;0.01 compared with
  untreated group. E, HeLa cells were incubated with apigenin and paclitaxel for 24
  hours, and then cells were subjected to RT-PCR analysis. GAPDH mRNA was used as
  house keeper gene.





  Mitochondrial pathway plays an important role in ROS triggered apoptosis ,  and
  caspase-2 has been considered as the apical caspase in mitochondrial death signal
  amplification loop , . ROS-induced caspase-2 cleavage and feedback amplification
  of the apoptotic signal have also been investigated . To examine the effect of apigenin
  on mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis, caspase-2 precursor cleavage was detected
  in apigenin-treated HeLa cells by western-blot analysis. Co-treatment of HeLa cells
  with apigenin and paclitaxel showed very low level of caspase-2 precursor. When
  HeLa cells were pretreated with NAC, the caspase-2 precursor level recovered. The
  caspase-2 inhibitor z-VDVAD-fmk significantly reduced the cleavage of caspase-3
  and PARP in HeLa cells treated with apigenin combined with paclitaxel. MMP may be
  a causal event in precipitating apoptosis. The data in Fig. 5D indicated that apigenin
  but not paclitaxel induced an increase of depolarization of MMP suggesting the importance
  of apigenin in apigenin/paclitaxel induced cancer cell apoptosis. As expected, z-VDVAD-fmk
  inhibited the increase of MMP in apigenin and apigenin/paclitaxel treated groups.
  Fig. 5E showed that treatment of apigenin, paclitaxel or apigenin/paclitaxel did
  not alter the mRNA level of caspase-2 indicating apigenin/paclitaxel co-treatment
  only increased activation of caspase-2.


  To confirm the importance of caspase-2 in apigenin/paclitaxel-triggered mitochondrial
  membrane permeabilization and apoptosis, we perform caspase-2 over-expression and
  knock-down experiments and measured AIF, Endo G and cytochrome c releasing from
  mitochondrion in HeLa cells. Over-expression of caspase-2 significantly enhanced
  apigenin or apigenin/paclitaxel-induced increase of AIF, Endo G and cytochrome c
  in cytoplasma fraction and decrease of AIF, Endo G and cytochrome c in mitochondrial
  fraction. As expected, caspase-2 knock-down resulted in the opposite on apigenin
  or apigenin/paclitaxel induced changes of AIF, Endo G and cytochrome c in HeLa cells.
  Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 6B, over-expression of caspase-2 apparently increased
  apigenin/paclitaxel-induced cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP and knock-down of caspase-2
  inhibited such effect of apigenin/paclitaxel. We next detected cell vitality to
  evaluate mediated effect of caspase-2 on apigenin/paclitaxel triggered HeLa cell
  apoptosis. Over-expression of caspase-2 caused about 10% decrease of cell vitality
  both in apigenin and co-treatment groups, and caspase-2 silence significantly increased
  cell vitality. However, there was no significant change in paclitaxel treated groups
  no matter whether caspase-2 was over-expressed or down-expressed. Combined, the
  above data suggested that caspase-2 did play an important role in apigenin/paclitaxel
  induced apoptosis of HeLa cells.






  Figure 6.  Caspase-2 cleavage is important for apigenin/paclitaxel-induced apoptosis.


  A, HeLa cells were transfected with flag-caspase2 or RNAi-caspase2. Forty-eight
  hours after transfection, cells were treated with apigenin, paclitaxel or both of
  them for 24 hours. The mitochondrial fraction was separated from cytosolic fraction.
  The protein levels of AIF, Endo G and cytochrome c in both fractions were measured.
  β-actin and COX-IV were probed as the cytosolic and mitochondrial control respectively.
  Cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions were displayed as C and M respectively. B,
  Cells were treated as same as described in A. Protein levels of PARP, cleaved PARP,
  procaspase-2 and procaspase-3 were determined by Western blot analysis. C, Flag-caspase2
  or RNAi-caspase2 was transfected to HeLa cells, and 48 hours after tranfection,
  cells were treated with apigenin, paclitaxel or both of them for 24 hours. Cell
  vitality was measured with a cytotoxicity detection kit from Promega. The experiment
  was independently repeated for three times and data were shown as mean±S.D. p&lt;0.05
  compared with empty-plasmid transfected group.





  It has been well recognized that apigenin and many other flavonoids act as anti-oxidants.
  Their ability to scavenge ROS was believed to be related with their effects on anti-cancer,
  chemoprevention  and anti-inflammation . However, up until now, only a few attentions
  have been paid to the pro-oxidant effect of apigenin . The reason for why flavonoids
  possess both pro-oxidant and anti-oxidant capability is unclear. Some studies suggested
  that it depended on the dose of flavonoids and the type of cells . Cancer cells
  are frequently under persistent oxidative stress because of oncogenic stimulation,
  increased metabolic activity, and mitochondrial malfunction , .


  In the present study, we demonstrated that apigenin potentiated ROS accumulation
  in HeLa cells, which correlated closely with its inhibitory effect on SOD activity.
  SODs are the only enzymes dismuting superoxide radicals. We noticed that Zn2+, Cu2+
  and Mn2+ could reverse apigenin-induced suppression of SOD activity whereas these
  metal ions did not affect the basal SOD activity. It was probably that apigenin
  formed a stable complex with metal ions and acted as a competitive inhibitor of
  SOD. More detailed studies are needed in the future. In fact, two stable coordination
  geometries of the aluminum complex of apigenin have been identified .


  Our study indicated that apigenin/paclitaxel-induced the cleavage of caspase-2 in
  a ROS dependent manner and consequently led to MMP which resulted in leakage of
  pro-apoptotic proteins from mitochondrion, such as SMAC/DIABLO , , Htr2A/Omi  and
  cytochrome c . These data was consistent with previous studies in neuron stem cells
  , leukemia cells , and MCF-7 cells, which suggested ROS as a precipitating factor
  in caspase-2 cleavage in these cell lines. Numerous in vivo studies have showed
  that SOD could highly express in aggressive human solid tumors . It has also been
  reported that MnSOD can be induced by cytotoxic drugs and this may be related with
  development of drug resistance and a poor prognosis after chemotherapy in cancer
  cells , . In our current study, apigenin treatment caused the suppression of SOD,
  particularly the suppression of MnSOD. On the other hand, DETC, a well approved
  inhibitor of both CuZnSOD and MnSOD enhanced paclitaxel induced apoptosis. These
  results strongly suggested that SOD activity was a critical factor in paclitaxel
  induced apoptosis and apigenin enhanced paclitaxel-induced apoptosis through suppressing
  SOD activity.


  Though it have been addressed that apigenin was a potential inducer of intracellular
  oxidative stress, and apigenin-induced production of ROS play a vital role in apoptosis
  signal , very limited data was presented on setting apigenin as a candidate to be
  used in combination with traditional anti-neoplastic agents. Paclitaxel, a potent
  traditional anti-cancer drug, can cause both mitotic arrest and apoptotic cell death
  . However, a high dose of paclitaxel applied clinically shows serious side effects
  and drug resistance –. Our results demonstrated the synergistic effects of apigenin
  and paclitaxel on promoting HeLa cell apoptosis. Apigenin sensitized HeLa cells
  to paclitaxel-induced apoptosis through suppressing MnSOD and cooperated with paclitaxel
  to stimulate caspase-2 activation. The results that AIF, EndoG and cytochrome c
  were releasing from mitochondrion indicates both caspase dependent and caspase independent
  machineries are working in the apigenin enhanced paclitaxel induced apoptosis. Apigenin,
  as a potent natural anti-cancer compound, showed little cytotoxicity toward non-transformed
  cells and possessed non-mutagenic nature. The combination use of apigenin and paclitaxel
  will greatly improve the efficiency of paclitaxel as a chemotherapeutic drug. Reduction
  of the dose of paclitaxel in cancer therapy will decrease its adverse reactions.


  In conclusion, our study demonstrates that combination of apigenin and paclitaxel
  possesses a more apparent anti-cancer activity in vitro compared with each of them
  alone. Mechanically, apigenin suppresses the activity of SOD to lead cancer cells
  sensitive to cytotoxity of paclitaxel. Furthermore, ROS-induced activation of caspase-2
  and depolarization of MMP participate in apigenin and paclitaxel induced cancer
  cell apoptosis. Therefore, this study indicates the synergistic anti-cancer effects
  of apigenin and paclitaxel in tumor chemotherapy.






  Dot plots of annexin V/PI staining on viable versus apoptotic of a drug resistant
  cell line MCF-7. Cells were either left untreated or as previously described with
  15 µM apigenin and 4 nM paclitaxel. At the indicated time of 24 hours, cells were
  stained for annexin V/PI. Analyses were conducted on 5,000 cells in each case.
