  Piperine is a major alkaloid component of black pepper, which is a widely consumed
  spice. Here, we investigated the effect of piperine on mouse T lymphocyte activation.
  Piperine inhibited polyclonal and antigen-specific T lymphocyte proliferation without
  affecting cell viability. Piperine also suppressed T lymphocyte entry into the S
  and G2/M phases of the cell cycle, and decreased expression of G1-associated cyclin
  D3, CDK4, and CDK6. In addition, piperine inhibited CD25 expression, synthesis of
  interferon-γ, interleukin-2, IL-4, and IL-17A, and the generation of cytotoxic effector
  cells. The inhibitory effect of piperine on T lymphocytes was associated with hypophosphorylation
  of Akt, extracellular signal-regulated kinase, and inhibitor of κBα, but not ZAP-70.
  The ability of piperine to inhibit several key signaling pathways involved in T
  lymphocyte activation and the acquisition of effector function suggests that piperine
  might be useful in the management of T lymphocyte-mediated autoimmune and chronic
  inflammatory disorders. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved'
