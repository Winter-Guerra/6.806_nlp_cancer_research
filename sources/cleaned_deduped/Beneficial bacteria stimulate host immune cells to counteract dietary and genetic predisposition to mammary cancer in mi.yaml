  Recent studies suggest health benefits including protection from cancer after eating
  fermented foods such as probiotic yogurt, though the mechanisms are not well understood.
  Here we tested mechanistic hypotheses using two different animal models: the first
  model studied development of mammary cancer when eating a Westernized diet, and
  the second studied animals with a genetic predilection to breast cancer. For the
  first model, outbred Swiss mice were fed a Westernized chow putting them at increased
  risk for development of mammary tumors. In this Westernized diet model, mammary
  carcinogenesis was inhibited by routine exposure to Lactobacillus reuteri ATCC-PTA-6475
  in drinking water. The second model was FVB strain erbB2 mutant mice, genetically
  susceptible to mammary tumors mimicking breast cancers in humans, being fed a regular
  chow diet. We found that oral supplement with these purified lactic acid bacteria
  alone was sufficient to inhibit features of mammary neoplasia in both models. The
  protective mechanism was determined to be microbially-triggered CD4+CD25+ lymphocytes.
  When isolated and transplanted into other subjects, these L. reuteri-stimulated
  lymphocytes were sufficient to convey transplantable anti-cancer protection in the
  cell recipient animals. These data demonstrate that host immune responses to environmental
  microbes significantly impact and inhibit cancer progression in distal tissues such
  as mammary glands, even in genetically susceptible mice. This leads us to conclude
  that consuming fermentative microbes such as L. reuteri may offer a tractable public
  health approach to help counteract the accumulated dietary and genetic carcinogenic
  events integral in the Westernized diet and lifestyle.


  Breast cancer is the most prevalent type of cancer in women worldwide and a leading
  cause of neoplasia-associated mortality. Although genetic predisposition plays a
  role, accumulating epidemiological and experimental data also link an unhealthy
  diet and obesity with postmenopausal mammary cancer occurrence and growth. The mechanisms
  explaining this connection are largely unknown. Several lines of evidence, however,
  suggest that inter-related metabolic and inflammatory pathways may be involved.
  Specifically, altered hormonal pathways involving estrogens, insulin and insulin
  growth factor, imbalances in the expression of adipokines such as leptin and adiponectin
  and obesity-associated proinflammatory signaling have all been shown to promote
  mammary tumorigenesis. Interestingly, data from several elegant experiments using
  high-fat diet-fed mice indicate that obesity-associated inflammation could promote
  mammary cancer independently from ovarian hormones, insulin and adipokine effects.
  Taken together these data suggest that immune system-related events may hold the
  key trigger role in the complex interplay between growth factors, hormones and adipokine
  signaling, which connects diet and obesity with mammary carcinogenesis. Despite
  the progress made in identifying the mechanisms underlying the obesity-mammary cancer
  associations, the question "how do we block the adverse effects of obesity on postmenopausal
  breast cancer?" has been recently characterized as urgent.


  In an earlier series of experiments we have shown that inflammatory signals from
  bacteria colonizing the gut can trigger mammary carcinogenesis in mice. Specifically,
  anti-inflammatory therapies including anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha treatments,
  and adoptive cell transfer using gut-bacteria-activated regulatory T cells are able
  to block tumor-promoting effects in both ApcMin/+ and MMTV-HER2/neu mouse model.
  Murine models exhibiting mutations in the erbB2 gene are widely used to mimic neoplastic
  processes seen in ∼30% of patients with breast cancer. Interestingly, recent evidence
  from women with estrogen-receptor-negative breast cancer shows that tumor-infiltrating
  Treg are associated with a more favorable clinical outcome.


  In a more recent series of experiments we discovered that feeding mice with the
  edible probiotic bacterium Lactobacillus reuteri exerts unexpected effects in the
  integument, namely that L. reuteri-fed mice have radiant fur with increased anagenic
  hair follicles. In these studies L. reuteri was chosen due to broad relevancy by
  colonizing many mammalian species, the precedent for L. reuteri to treat or prevent
  human diseases such as diarrhea in children, the well-established precedent in scientific
  literature using L. reuteri as a model probiotic organism, that L. reuteri ATCC-PTA-6475
  was originally isolated from human milk, previously demonstrated efficacy in inflammatory
  diseases in mouse models, in particular this "anti-inflammatory" isolate suited
  our immune system study goals, and L. reuteri is very easy to cultivate and dose
  to animals. In a separate line of experiments we find that L. reuteri rescues mice
  from diet-induced obesity and fat pathology via CD4+Foxp3+CD25+ regulatory T cell-associated
  immunomodulatory effects. Our recent findings regarding the effects of L. reuteri
  upon Treg cells are in line with previous studies showing that L. reuteri stimulates
  the development of host protective regulatory-T cells in vitro as well as in vivo.
  These data taken together with previous evidence that dietary lactic acid bacteria
  could lower the risk of breast cancer in women, and also suppress mammary cancer
  development in mice through immune-system regulatory events, led us to test the
  effects of L. reuteri consumption in mouse models of mammary cancer.


  In the present study, using first a high-fat diet-associated outbred mouse, and
  then a classical, diet-unrelated genetically engineered MMTV-HER2/neu mouse model
  of mammary cancer, we found that eating purified lactic acid bacteria alone was
  sufficient to delay onset of preneoplastic or neoplastic features in both models.
  The protective mechanism involved microbially triggered antigen activated CD4+CD25+
  cells that were sufficient to bestow transplantable anti-cancer protection to recipient
  host MMTV-HER2/neu mice. These data demonstrate that host immune responses to environmental
  microbes significantly impact cancer progression in distal nonintestinal tissues.
  In these studies, modulation of the tumor micro-environment by regulating systemic
  immune cell responses at the whole organism level was found to counteract dietary
  or genetic predisposition to cancer.






  Outbred CD-1 mice, and inbred MMTV-neu FVB strain mice, were housed and handled
  in Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care-accredited
  facilities with diets, experimental methods, and housing as specifically approved
  by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. The MIT CAC specifically approved
  the studies as well as the housing and handling of these animals. For studies using
  outbred mice, the experimental design was to expose mice to diets starting at age
  = 8 weeks, and then continue the treatment for 12 weeks until euthanasia using carbon
  dioxide overdose at 5 months of age, unless otherwise specified. Each experiment
  included 5-15 animals per group with one replicate experiment. Mammary tissues were
  collected upon necropsy and then examined histologically.


  For experiments using HER2 mice, age-matched female HER2/neu mutant mice were either
  untreated or had their water continuously supplemented with L. reuteri beginning
  at 8 weeks of age. Mice were euthanized when animals reached 1 year of age, or earlier
  if the total cumulative tumor burden on the animal reached 2 cm in diameter. In
  studies using adoptive cell transfer, otherwise untreated 6-month-old female HER2
  mice with pre-existing tumor burden where randomly subdivided into treatment groups
  that received cell transplant injections as described in detail below.




  Outbred Swiss mice were placed on experimental diets starting at 8 weeks of age:
  control AIN-76A, and a Westernized diet with high fat and low fiber with substandard
  levels of Vitamin D, consumed until euthanasia at 20 weeks of age.


  In a separate set of studies, FVB strain HER2 transgenic mice and FVB strain wt
  cell donor animals received a standard animal facility mouse chow.


  Subsets of these Swiss or FVB mice received in their drinking water an anti-inflammatory
  strain of Lactobacillus reuteri ATCC-PTA-6475 cultivated as described elsewhere,
  with live organisms supplied at a starting dosage of 3.5 × 105 organisms/mouse/day
  in drinking water. Live bacterial counts in water bottles were calculated to be
  1.4 × 106 colony forming units per mouse after 24 hr, 4.1 × 105 CFU at 48 hr, and
  1.1 × 105 CFU at 72 hr, when quantified as described in detail below. Control mice
  received regular drinking water. Fresh drinking water for both groups of animals
  was replaced twice weekly throughout the experiments. Levels of L. reuteri were
  undetectably low in untreated animals using PCR as described below.




  Lactobacillus reuteri was cultivated as described in previous studies. To ascertain
  counts of live organisms in drinking water per day, log phase cultures were diluted
  to 0.05 OD and 100 µL plated for overnight growth on blood agar plates. Overnight
  cultures were collected into sterile phosphate buffered saline and the optical density
  was measured. The OD of the preparation was adjusted to 1.0 and measured once again
  for confirmation. Then 1 mL of suspension was added to five separate bottles containing
  480 mL of sterile water each and allowed to incubate overnight. The following morning
  the contents were mixed by gentle inversion and 1 mL was diluted 100-fold in sterile
  water; 50 µL of this dilution were plated at a frequency of 3 BAP per bottle. Again
  bottles were allowed to stand overnight and another 1 mL sample taken from them
  each, then diluted 100-fold and plated. This process was repeated over 4 days. Colonies
  were counted 48 hr after plating due to small colony size. Counts were averaged
  across and between bottles per day and number of total CFU in drinking water was
  extrapolated based on dilution fold and total water volume.




  Feces were collected from animals prior to L. reuteri treatment as well as at time
  of necropsy to gauge its presence post-treatment in comparison with baseline levels
  of the bacteria. DNA was extracted using the QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit from Qiagen.
  The extraction was performed as per the manufacturers specifications with the exemption
  of an added fecal dissociation step during the resuspension where sterile beads
  were added to the samples and subsequently placed in a Bullet Blender for more efficient
  sample homogenization. L. reuteri specific quantitative PCRs were performed utilizing
  primers reported by Dommels et al. on an Applied Biosystems 7500 real-time PCR machine
  at a final concentration of 0.4 µM each. Assays were conducted in 25 µL volumes
  containing 12.5 µL SYBR Select Master Mix. DNA concentrations were measured utilizing
  a Thermo Science Nanodrop 2000C and 100 ng of DNA were loaded per reaction. Amplification
  was performed verbatim as previously specified and absolute quantifications were
  performed by comparison to a dilution series.




  Mice were treated with anti-CD25 antibody at 150 μg per mouse intraperitoneally
  3× weekly for 12 weeks starting a 8-weeks-of-age. Treated mice were compared to
  mice receiving sham isotype antibody alone. Depletion of CD25+ cells was confirmed
  by undetectably low fractions of CD25+ cells in spleens of mice treated with anti-CD25
  antibody compared to sham-treated controls using flow cytometry. Depletion was confirmed
  by absence of Foxp3+ cells in spleen.




  CD4+ lymphocytes isolated from wild type FVB strain female mice using magnetic beads
  are sorted by hi-speed flow cytometry to first obtain purified populations of CD4+
  lymphocytes and determined to be ∼96% pure as previously described elsewhere. Syngeneic
  FVB strain MMTV-neu transgenic recipient mice were then injected intraperitoneally
  with 3 × 105 CD4+ CD45RBloCD25+ cells determined to be ∼96% pure as previously described
  elsewhere.




  For histologic evaluation, formalin-fixed tissues were embedded in paraffin, cut
  at 5 μm, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Lesions were analyzed and quantified
  by a pathologist blinded to sample identity. Hyperplastic and preneoplastic lesions
  in the mammary gland of aged Swiss mice were scored on a 0-6 scale according to
  the following scheme: 0: normal; 1: Focal, multifocal or diffuse hyperplasia, low
  grade without atypia; 2: Focal, multifocal or diffuse hyperplasia, intermediate
  grade without atypia; 3: Focal, multifocal or diffuse hyperplasia, high grade without
  atypia; 4: Focal, multifocal or diffuse hyperplasia with mild atypia; 5: Focal,
  multifocal or diffuse hyperplasia with marked atypia; 6: Carcinoma in situ.


  Immunohistochemistry and morphometric assessment were as previously described. IHC-positive
  immune cells or pixels and toluidine-stained mast cells were counted in 20× or 40×
  images and results were recorded as number of cells or pixels per image. Primary
  antibodies for IHC included rabbit polyclonal antibodies for β-catenin, cleaved
  caspase-3, NFκ-B-p65 and c-Jun, Ki-67, and a rat monoclonal antibody for Foxp3 detection.
  Primary antibody binding was detected with goat anti-rabbit polymer HRP or biotinylated
  goat anti-rat IgG. Heat-induced antigen retrieval was performed with citrate buffer,
  pH 6, for β-catenin, cleaved caspase-3, NFκ-B-p65 and c-Jun or with EDTA buffer,
  pH 8, for ki-67 and Foxp-3. The ImageJ image processing and analysis program was
  used for all quantitative histomorphometry assessments.




  The Mann-Whitney U test was used for body weight, and histomorphometry. Mammary
  tumor volume and multiplicity was evaluated using unpaired student T test. A p value
  ; 0.05 was statistically significant.






  Obesity-inducing diets promote mammary cancer in both humans and mice. To recapitulate
  these observations we fed genetically outbred Swiss female mice an ad libitum diet
  of New Westernized diet chow mimicking typical human "fast food"-style diets that
  are high in fat and sugar, and low in fiber and vitamins B and D. We examined the
  mammary tissues of the 5-month-old mice when fed continuously on Western and control
  diets starting at age = 8 weeks, in order to determine the frequency and spectrum
  of diet-induced mammary pathology. We found that the mammary ducts and terminal
  duct lobular units of Westernized chow-fed mice had increased focal, multifocal,
  or diffuse hyperplastic lesions of varying severity. Hyperplastic glands often showed
  lateral budding, epithelial cell atypia, increased mitotic figures and intra-epithelial
  neoplasia. Foci of hyperplastic alveoli resembling hyperplastic alveolar nodules
  were also evident. The evidence of proliferating cells with ki-67-specific immunohistochemistry
  confirmed the hyperproliferation of mammary glands in mice eating Western chow.
  Using a semi-quantitative scoring system, we found that the mammary pathology score
  of Westernized chow-fed mice differed significantly from that of mice consuming
  control diet.


  Figure 1\. Effect of diet and L. reuteri supplementation on mammary gland pathology
  of Swiss mice. Ducts and the terminal duct lobular units of westernized diet-fed
  mice have precancerous epithelial lesions. The mammary intraepithelial neoplasia
  cells fill the lumen of the duct and show increased mitoses, and marked pleomorphism.
  The lesion in mammary alveoli is an atypical lobule showing histological features
  of the "hyperplastic alveolar nodules" such as atypical cells, an intermediate grade
  of anisokaryosis and light-brown stained lipid pigments. Compare with normal histology
  of mammary glands from mice consuming control diet or westernized-diet+L. reuteri.
  The westernized diet-induced hyperproliferative state of mammary gland epithelium
  can be better appreciated with ki-67 specific immunohistochemistry. Ki-67+ proliferating
  cell nuclei are numerous in contrast to control-diet or westernized-diet+L. reuteri-fed
  mice. Histopathology: Hematoxylin and eosin. Ki-67: DAB chromogen, Hematoxylin counterstain.
  Bars: Histopathology = 50 μm; Ki-67 = 100 μm.

  of diet-associated hyperplastic and early neoplastic lesions in the mammary glands
  of 5-months-old Swiss mice. Figures demonstrate the grading system and depict the

  pleomorphism. Statistical analysis of semi-quantified mammary gland histopathology.
  The y-axis depicts the mean ± SEM of histopathological scores given in each experimental

  tumors of aged Swiss mice. Variably sized neoplastic glands grow in cords and nests
  and have a medium amount of intervening stroma. Malignant epithelial cells are highly
  atypical with marked nuclear pleomorphism, increased mitotic figures, including
  atypical ones, and apoptosis. The mammary tumors show immunohistochemical evidence
  of abnormal β-catenin distribution. There is loss of the normal lateral membrane
  staining pattern, diffuse cytoplasmic and occasional nuclear stabilization. Numerous
  Ki-67+ neoplastic cells are shown in the right panel. Hematoxylin and eosin. DAB

  To examine the malignant potential of diet-associated mammary preneoplasia and early
  neoplasia found at Swiss mice at 5 months of age, we assessed the frequency of mammary
  tumors arising in these mice with the progression of age. We discovered 2-cm diameter
  mammary tumors arising in two of 1-year-old Swiss mice on Westernized chow, but
  none in their age-matched female Swiss mice consuming a control diet. Overt mammary
  tumors in these mice eating Western chow exhibited typical histopathology of high-grade
  glandular adenocarcinoma. In addition to traditional criteria of high mitotic index
  and cellular atypia, malignant phenotype of these tumors was further confirmed by
  immunohistochemistry profiles consistent with carcinoma. The neoplastic cells had
  an abnormal β-catenin staining pattern with diffuse cytoplasmic and occasional nuclear
  stabilization, indicative of dysregulation in the wnt gene signaling pathway. Proliferating
  ki-67+ neoplastic cells were numerous throughout mammary tissue.




  It is widely known that intestinal microbes modulate host health through activities
  of CD4+ immune cells, at least in part through interleukin-6-dependent reciprocal
  functions of anti-inflammatory Foxp3+ regulatory cells and proinflammatory T helper
  17 cells. Based upon our previous observations involving inflammatory cells and
  cytokines in mouse models of cancer, we examined critical cellular components of
  the immune system of the 5-month-old Westernized "fast food"-style Westernized diet-fed
  Swiss female mice. At this time-point of neoplastic initiation, we found that the
  mammary lymph nodes of NWD-fed mice had significantly fewer Foxp3+ cells compared
  to the mammary lymph nodes of mice consuming the control diet. This result matches
  our previous findings regarding the effect of NWD on the mesenteric lymph node Treg
  cell population. In the NWD-fed female Swiss mice, a topographical association of
  Foxp3+ cells with abnormal mammary glands was not observed. Abnormal glands, however,
  were surrounded by significantly increased numbers of mast cells, as previously
  shown in mammary carcinoma of humans and rodent models. Consequently, the number
  of mast cells in the abnormal mammary epithelium of Westernized chow-eating mice
  was significantly higher from that of control diet mice, accompanied by sparse Foxp3+
  Treg cells.


  Figure 3\. The L. reuteri anti-neoplastic effect correlates with restoration of
  control-level Treg and mast cell populations. Western-type diet induced lesions
  in the mammary gland correlate with a morphometrically assessed significant decrease
  of Foxp3+ in the mammary lymph nodes and significant increase of peri-glandular
  Toluidine Blue-stained mast cells. Dietary supplementation with L. reuteri restores
  the immune cell populations along with mammary gland histology at the base-line
  control diet-matched levels. Foxp3-specific IHC: DAB chromogen, Hematoxylin counterstain.
  Mast cells: Toluidine Blue stain. Bars = 50 μm.





  Previous studies have shown that routine dietary intake of lactic acid bacteria
  may lower the risk of breast cancer in women, and also suppress mammary cancer development
  in mice. This led us to test the effects of L. reuteri consumption in this mouse
  model of mammary malignancy. We found that hyperplastic and pre-neoplastic features
  were observed in significantly lower frequency in animals receiving purified L.
  reuteri ATCC-PTA-6475 when adding 3.5 × 105 organisms/mouse/day to their regular
  drinking water. L. reuteri-induced restoration of glandular epithelium coincided
  with a significant increase of mammary lymph node Foxp3+ cells and a significant
  reduction of mammary tissue mast cells to the base-line control-diet levels.


  We next examined whether consumption of L. reuteri may inhibit Western diet-induced
  obesity. Accumulating data specifically link Westernized diet-induced obesity with
  mammary cancer occurrence and growth. Existing data suggest that immune system-related
  events may hold the key trigger role in the complex interplay between growth factors,
  hormones and adipokine signaling, which connects high fat diet and obesity with
  mammary carcinogenesis. We found that 5-month-old mice eating NWD and also consuming
  L. reuteri in drinking water were significantly leaner than those mice fed NWD alone.
  We had previously found that while Swiss mice eating L. reuteri were uniformly slender,
  their age-matched counterparts eating L. reuteri and simultaneously treated with
  anti-CD25 antibody instead rapidly developed morbid obesity and profound abdominal
  fat pathology during the ensuing 3 months. Swiss mice eating L. reuteri also exhibited
  significantly increased anti-inflammatory Foxp3+ Treg cells and lower levels of
  IL-17 protein within lymph tissues draining the intestinal tract, along with higher
  levels of IL-10 protein and lower levels of IL-17 protein in serum, when compared
  with matched control mice. This suggested that host ability to recruit properly
  functioning anti-inflammatory Treg cells and resulting immune homeostasis is essential
  for protection from obesity. Following this reasoning, we postulated that intestinal
  microbe-activated CD4+CD25+ Treg cells may serve to connect obesity with risk for
  development of cancer in tissues such as mammary gland.




  Based upon our earlier work linking intestinal bacteria with mammary glands via
  recruitment of CD4+CD25+ immune cells, plus other studies showing dietary lactic
  acid bacteria suppress mammary cancer through immune-system regulatory events, we
  hypothesized that lactic acid organisms such as L. reuteri may protect from cancer
  by favorably biasing the immune system through induction of anti-inflammatory CD4+CD25+
  Treg cells. We tested this using depletion of CD4+CD25+ cells via systemic anti-CD25
  antibody administration in L. reuteri-treated mice. We found that anti-CD25 systemic
  treatment negated the beneficial effect of L. reuteri, and resulted instead in increased
  mammary hyperplastic and preneoplastic lesions with an abnormal mammary gland-associated
  accumulation of mast cells. The latter mast cell accumulation effect was also observed
  in untreated Westernized diet-fed mice depleted of CD25+ cells and without L. reuteri.
  This result further supports the conclusion that the systemic CD25+ cell population
  inversely correlates with the mast cell accumulations in the mammary gland. In sum,
  the female mice fed Westernized chow were susceptible to obesity and mast cell-associated
  mammary carcinoma that were inhibited by feeding L. reuteri. The protective effect
  of consuming L. reuteri occurred in a CD25 cell-dependent manner.


  Figure 4\. The protective effect of L. reuteri depends upon CD25+ cells. The depletion
  of CD25+ cells negated the protective effect offered by L. reuteri in mice consuming
  the western-type diet. Compare the mammary gland from a CD25 cell-depleted mouse
  with carcinoma in situ with the mammary gland from a sham antibody-treated mouse
  showing only low grade hyperplasia without atypia. The mammary epithelium of sham
  antibody-treated control mice had occasional Ki-67+ proliferating cells. In contrast,
  CD25 cell-depleted mice had a hyperproliferative mammary gland epithelium. Mammary
  gland pathology after CD25+ cell depletion co-existed with a significant increase
  of mast cells. Histopathology: Hematoxylin and eosin. Ki-67: DAB chromogen, Hematoxylin
  counterstain. Mast cells: Toluidine Blue stain. Bars: Histopathology = 25 μm; Ki-67
  = 100 μm; Mast cells = 50 μm.





  To test whether an obesity component is specifically required for cancer-protective
  benefits of L. reuteri, we next tested L. reuteri efficacy in mice that do not typically
  develop age-associated obesity: an FVB strain erbB2 mutant mouse genetically predisposed
  to mammary tumors mimicking 30% of breast cancers diagnosed in women. For these
  studies, age-matched HER2/neu mutant mice, that develop tumors without obesity when
  eating regular chow, were either untreated or had their drinking water supplemented
  with L. reuteri. The study duration allowed mice to reach 1 year of age, unless
  these animals were humanely euthanized prematurely due to a total cumulative mammary
  tumor burden exceeding 2 cm in diameter. The HER2 transgenic mouse model, unlike
  the outbred Swiss mice which were obese, did not require age-associated obesity
  in order to spontaneously develop numerous and large-sized mammary tumors.


  Figure 5\. Tumor-free survival was increased in HER2 transgenic mice after eating
  purified L. reuteri. Mice exhibited a delayed onset of mammary tumor burden. This
  anti-cancer protection effect was transplantable using highly purified CD4+CD45RBloCD25+
  immune cells into HER2 transgenic recipient mice.





  Knowing that dietary intake of certain lactic acid organisms was previously shown
  to lower the risk of breast cancer in women, and mammary cancer in mice, led us
  to test the effects of L. reuteri consumption in mouse models of mammary malignancy.
  Age-matched HER2/neu mutant mice were either untreated or had their water supplemented
  with L. reuteri ATCC-PTA-6475 with live organisms supplied at a starting dosage
  of 3.5 × 105 organisms/mouse/day in drinking water. Mice were euthanized when the
  total cumulative tumor burden on the animal reached 2 cm in diameter or when animals
  reached 1 year of age. We found that treating with L. reuteri in water delayed or
  completely prevented tumor onset when compared with untreated mice. This showed
  that consumption of lactic acid bacteria alone was sufficient to inhibit mammary
  tumorigenesis and improve tumor-free longevity, even in mice genetically predisposed
  to cancer, with consumption of lactic acid microbes counteracting genetic risks.




  In addition, we found that key indicators of malignancy were significantly altered
  in transgenic animals receiving regular chow in combination with purified L. reuteri
  in their drinking water. Mammary tumors of untreated MMTV-neu HER2 mice eating regular
  diets displayed the typical histopathological features for this mouse model. Tumors
  were primarily solid but often had areas displaying a papillary growth pattern.
  In contrast to spontaneous tumors of aged Swiss mice on westernized diet, HER2/neu
  tumors showed no abnormal β-catenin staining pattern. Dietary L. reuteri in HER2
  mice did not alter the histopathological pattern of tumor growth or the proliferating
  capacity of tumor cells. However, tumors from probiotic-fed mice had increased areas
  of intra-tumoral necrosis and increased features of histopathologically discernible
  apoptosis. To quantify apoptosis more accurately we utilized caspase-3 specific
  immunostaining. Morphometric counts of apoptosis showed that tumors from L. reuteri-treated
  mice had significantly more apoptosis compared to tumors from their nontreated counterparts.
  To further elaborate on this result, we examined the tumors for the expression of
  two pleiotropic factors with known anti-apoptotic effects on tumors, including those
  originating from mammary epithelium. Utilizing NFκ-B p65- and c-Jun-specific immunohistochemistry
  and morphometric counts of positively-stained cells in comparable tumor areas, we
  found that L. reuteri induced a significant decrease of nuclear NFκ-B and of c-Jun
  in neoplastic cells. Interestingly, tumor cells neighboring to necrotic areas in
  tumors from L. reuteri-fed mice had increased c-Jun expression. These data, when
  combined, suggested that consuming L. reuteri served to upregulate apoptosis in
  the tumor prone mammary tissue.


  Figure 6\. Feeding of L. reuteri increases apoptosis and suppresses anti-apoptotic
  signals in HER2/neu mammary tumors. Morphometric counts of immunohistochemically
  labeled tumors suggest that L. reuteri consumption associates with a significant
  increase in neoplastic cell apoptosis and a significantly decrease in NFκ-B- and
  c-Jun-derived tumor cell-originating anti-apoptotic signals. DAB chromogen, Hematoxylin
  counterstain. Bars: Caspase-3 = 50 μm; NFκ-B p65 and c-Jun = 25 μm.





  To identify a cellular mechanism of the benefits of the probiotic, and having previously
  shown a protective role for CD25+ cells in Swiss mice, we purified CD4+CD45RBloCD25+
  cells from syngeneic FVB wild-type mice that were either untreated or supplemented
  with oral administration of L. reuteri in the drinking water, as above. Afterward,
  3 × 105 purified CD4+CD45RBloCD25+ lymphocytes were injected intraperitoneally into
  randomly untreated recipient HER2/neu mutant animals with some pre-existing tumor
  burden at 6 months of age. All recipient animals were euthanized at 3-4 weeks after
  adoptive cell transfer. We found that transfer of L. reuteri treated CD4+CD45RBloCD25+
  cells alone was sufficient to inhibit or suppress mammary tumors when compared with
  untreated animals or with animals that received cells from untreated FVB donor mice.
  Mice that received L. reuteri treated CD4+CD45RBloCD25+ cells had a significantly
  smaller tumor burden and fewer tumors compared with the other treatment groups.
  Taken together, this was in line with earlier work showing that intestinal bacteria
  impact systemic carcinogenic events via recruitment of bacteria-triggered CD4+CD25+
  immune cells, and supported our hypothesis that lactic acid organisms such as L.
  reuteri may protect from cancer by favorably biasing the immune system through induction
  of anti-inflammatory CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells.




  Here we used two etiologically divergent animal models to investigate mechanisms
  of lactic acid microbes previously shown to impact breast cancer outcomes in women.
  In both mouse models we found that exposure to L. reuteri in their drinking water
  ultimately lowered risk of mammary carcinogenesis in an immune cell-dependent manner.
  Importantly, we show that lower cancer risk outcomes were achievable in both models
  using purified L. reuteri organisms alone, regardless of the baseline diet, an environmental
  microbial exposure such as L. reuteri was sufficient to inhibit carcinogenesis,
  even with a pre-existing genetic predilection to cancer, and L. reuteri cancer-protective
  outcomes required microbe-triggered CD25+ cells. We concluded that microbes such
  as L. reuteri may ultimately offer a tractable public health approach to foster
  protective immunity and help counteract the accumulated dietary and genetic carcinogenic
  events integral in the Westernized diet and lifestyle.


  Outbred Swiss mice consuming a Westernized "fast food" chow mimicked adiposity patterns
  and associated breast cancer risk in people, with lower risk of carcinogenesis after
  consuming L. reuteri. For an outbred strain, the Swiss mice had a remarkably increased
  diet-associated risk to develop pre-neoplastic and neoplastic mammary lesions in
  the present study. This risk may not exclusively be related to the diet. Although
  control-diet-fed Swiss mice had significantly less hyperplasia from westernized-diet
  fed mice, several mice of the control group did have some degree of focal or multifocal
  mammary gland hyperplasia. These changes, although mild, are rather unusual based
  on our empiric observations in virgin mice of other strains. This matches previously
  reported observations in mammary tissue of untreated FVB mice, an inbred strain
  closely related to the white Swiss mouse. Unlike FVB mice, the aged outbred Swiss
  mouse we examined showed no spontaneous mammary tumors when fed with a normal diet.
  Nonetheless, the possibility that mouse strain-related factors may contribute to
  some extent in the westernized diet-induced mammary tumorigenesis we report here
  cannot be excluded.


  Hyperproliferative and preneoplastic mammary glands in NWD-fed mice were surrounded
  by particularly increased numbers of mast cells. This is highly suggestive for a
  cross-talk between these cells and the proliferating epithelium, and reminiscent
  of their accumulation in the expanding terminal end bud of the mammary ductal system
  at puberty. Mast cells facilitate abnormal gland growth by extracellular matrix
  degradation and the remodeling of adjacent tissues. They also produce growth factors
  and cytokines. Studies in both humans and mice describe significant contributions
  of mast cells into tumor evolution and development.


  Mast cell accumulations were inversely related to the L. reuteri-induced restoration
  of the Foxp3+ cell population within mammary lymph nodes. In addition, mast cells
  were robustly increased after depletion of CD25+ cells. This result suggests that
  gut bacteria-triggered CD25+Foxp3+ Treg cells can not only inhibit systemic mast
  cell-associated pathologies, such as allergy and autoimmune reactions, but also
  early stage carcinogenesis, as well. Consequently, it supports the concept that
  exposures to lactic acid microbiota stimulate Treg cell-orchestrated immune networks
  capable of inhibiting inflammatory diseases, including early stage malignant transformation.


  These observations associated with a Western diet in aging Swiss female mice support
  a mechanistic model whereby lactic acid microbes impact host immunity, which in
  turn affects obesity and carcinogenesis that subsequently alters host immunity,
  and so forth. Once initiated, these processes may become self-sustaining. We postulate
  that oral dosing of L. reuteri imparts immune homeostasis that then maintains systemic
  immune balance relying upon sustained immune tolerance. Diet and microbe-induced
  failure of tolerance unifies these data with prior work involving inflammation,
  obesity, and cancer. Diverse disorders such as asthma and autoimmune diseases associated
  with Westernized living are widely believed to result from insufficient immune tolerance
  that is essential for sustained systemic health. Westernized diets are also low
  in vitamin D, a nutrient that normally works together with IL-10 to enforce immune
  tolerance and protect against inflammatory disorders and some types of cancer.


  To overcome diet and obesity-associated biases in understanding carcinogenesis,
  we separately tested roles of L. reuteri and candidate immune cells in slender erbB2
  mutant mice, with a genetic predisposition to mammary tumors mimicking 30% of breast
  cancers diagnosed in women. Our finding that mammary tumors from HER2/neu mice consuming
  L. reuteri have increased intratumoral necrosis and apoptosis is similar to our
  previous findings in ApcMin/+ mice after adoptive transfer of microbe-induced Treg
  cells. Regressive intestinal adenomas in these ApcMin/+ mice after Treg cell transfer
  were characterized by umbilicated necrotic centers and increased tumor cell apoptosis.
  NFκ-B and c-Jun expression of tumor cells have both been associated with increased
  tumor malignancy in humans and mouse models of mammary cancer, including the HER2/neu
  mice. An important aspect of the tumor-promoting effect of these pleiotropic proteins
  lies in their tumor cell survival and anti-apoptotic effects. We found that dietary
  L. reuteri blocked NFκ-B-p65 nuclear translocation and c-jun expression in mammary
  tumor cells. This effect may have rendered HER2/neu tumor cells less resistant to
  apoptosis, and thus explain, at least in part, the probiotic microbe-induced anti-neoplastic
  effect.


  It is not entirely clear how host hormones triggered by microbial symbionts such
  as L. reuteri may impact the carcinogenic processes. We have recently discovered
  that consumption of L. reuteri up-regulates plasma levels of the neuropeptide hormone
  oxytocin that also benefits damaged tissue repairs, a concept that may extrapolate
  from wound healing to breast cancer. It has also been shown that oxytocin may counteract
  some of the immune suppressive effects of estrogen. These observations, if translatable
  to humans, may be particularly important given the proposed roles of oxytocin in
  protection from breast cancer. In addition, emerging data relate oxytocin with metabolism
  and the immune system connecting microbial symbionts such as L. reuteri with immune
  fitness in evolutionary success.


  Our previous work and that of many others has revealed that CD4+CD25+ cells are
  a basic cellular carrier of gut microbially triggered signals that shape the immune
  system to restore homeostasis in inflammatory-associated pathologies, cancer, and
  reproductive health. We discovered that the L. reuteri benefit was transferable
  to other recipient animals using CD4+CD45RBloCD25+ cells alone, as long as those
  cells were from immune-competent donor animals. In our previous studies we have
  shown that homeostatic properties reside predominantly in this sub-population of
  Treg cells. In the present study transplanted CD4+CD45RBloCD25+ immune cells from
  L. reuteri-primed donor animals were sufficient to completely recapitulate the L.
  reuteri-induced phenomenon in HER2 transgenic recipient host animals. In conclusion,
  we found that ingested microbes impact the systemic immune system at the whole organism
  level and serve to counteract a genetic predisposition to cancer, even within the
  tumor micro-environment. Beneficial microbes may ultimately offer tractable population-based
  approaches to target cancer.
