  fish species from the Sinop region of the Black Sea were examined. The fat contents
  ranged from 1.26% to 18.12%. The protein contents were min 14.54% and maximum 20.26%.
  The fatty acid compositions of the fish ranged from 27.83 to 35.91% for saturated
  fatty acids, 19.50–33.80% for monounsaturated fatty acids and 15.25–40.02% for polyunsaturated
  fatty acids. Among the saturated fatty acids, palmitic acid was the dominant fatty
  acid for all the fish species. As a second saturated fatty acid, myristic acid was
  observed in four of the fish species and its content ranged from 4.72 to 7.31%.
  Whereas, for the other two fish species, the second saturated fatty acid was stearic
  acid ranging between 4.54 and 10.64%. Among the monounsaturated fatty acids, those
  occurring in the highest proportions were oleic acid and palmitoleic acid. Docosahexaenoic
  acid, eicosapentaenoic acid and linoleic acid were dominant polyunsaturated fatty
  acids, respectively. All the species, in particular the belone, the anchovy and
  the shad had high levels of the n-3 series.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFatty
  acids serve a wide variety of metabolic functions, critical to all forms of life.
  Polyunsaturated fatty acids, particularly the n-3 and n-6 series, play an important
  role in non-energy-producing biological functions. n-3 PUFA, namely eicosapentaenoic
  acid, 20:5n-3 docosapentaenoic acid, 22:5n-3 and docosahexaenoic acid, 22:6n-3 plays
  numerous roles within the human body .\n\nThe health benefits of the long-chain
  n-3 PUFA such as 20:5n-3 and 22:6n-3 have been well observed in scientific studies
  such as the prevention or reduction of human coronary artery disease , a significant
  decrease in total cholesterol and high density lipoprotein levels , in peripheral
  arterial disease, improvement in endothelial functions  improvement in depressive
  symptoms in parkinsonian patients , a reduction in the risk of breast cancer  and
  a reduction in the risk of prostate cancer .\n\nLong-chain n-3 PUFA cannot be easily
  synthesized by humans and must be ingested in the diet . Most of the PUFA of fish
  lipids occur as the n-3 type. The contents of different fatty acids in fish lipids
  depend on numerous factors, such as diet, the geographic location, the environmental
  temperature, the time of year, the body length, the lipid content, etc. .\n\nSinop
  is one of the important port cities on the Black Sea. In particular, anchovy is
  of utmost importance for commercial fishing in this area. Additionally, the other
  commercial fish species in this region are bonito, shad, belone, turbot, scorpion
  fish, horse mackerel, blue fish, red mullet and whiting. Knowledge of the fatty
  acid composition and nutritional value of commercially important fish species is
  needed. Therefore, this paper presents the fatty acid compositions and other nutritional
  values of a variety of commercial fish species found in the Sinop region of the
  Black Sea.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor this research, 2 kg each of six different species of commercially
  important fish were chosen and purchased from the local fish market in January 2011.
  These were anchovy, shad, belone, scorpion fish, bluefish, and red mullet. The average
  weights of the fish were 6.18 ± 0.3 g for anchovy, 229.60 ± 10.83 g for shad, 73.31
  ± 4.75 g for belone, 87.82 ± 9.91 g for scorpion fish, 110.37 ± 8.17 g for bluefish,
  and 10.29 ± 0.56 g for red mullet. A minimum of nine fish from each individual species
  were gutted, filleted and minced for analysis.\n\n\n\nThe moisture and ash contents
  were determined as described by AOAC , and the protein content was determined by
  the Kjeldahl method . The crude lipid content was performed by acid digestion prior
  to petroleum ether extraction in a Soxtec system . These analyses were performed
  in triplicate. After the fish carbohydrate value was calculated  the energy value
  was calculated according to the Atwater method . The fatty acid content was determined
  using the IUPAC II.D.19 method . The fatty acids were analyzed using a Perkin Elmer
  Auto System XL gas chromatograph equipped with a SP–2330 column and a flame ionization
  detector. The separation of the fatty acids methyl esters was achieved using a fused
  silica capillary column. The oven temperature was set at 120 °C for 2 min, then
  increased to 220 °C with a ramp rate of 5 °C/min, and then held for 15 min. The
  injector and detector temperatures were maintained at 240 and 250 °C, respectively.
  The carrier gas was helium at 10 psi with a split ratio of 1/50. The air and hydrogen
  pressures were 338 and 45 ml/min, respectively. The results were determined by the
  percentage of each fatty acid with respect to the total fatty acids. The fatty acid
  analyses were conducted in two replicates and the results were expressed in GC area
  % as mean values ± standard error. For identification of the fatty acids, their
  retention times were compared to those of the standard methyl esters. For conversion
  of the percentile values to units of weight, the formula recommended originally
  by Weihrauch et al.  and then Paul and Southgate  and Soriguer et al.  was employed.
  The formula for fish is as follows: Factor = 0.933 −. The conversion factor for
  the n-3 FA of E. encrasicolus: CF = 0.933 − = 0.92;/100 = 0.26 g/100 g of n-3.\n\n\n\nThe
  results of the analyses were presented as means ± standard errors. Statistical analysis
  was conducted with the Minitab Statistical Software package. A one-way analysis
  of the variance was used to verify the differences between the species and significance
  of those differences were tested with the Tukey Test. The significance level was
  P ; 0.05.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProximate composition of six fish species)  \n\n\n\nWithin

  main chemical components of fish meat are water, crude protein, and lipids. Together
  they make up approximately 98% of the total mass of flesh. The other constituents,
  i.e., carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals, are present in minor quantities. The
  contents of the main components in the fish body depend primarily on the species,
  the stage of maturity, the sex, the spawning cycle, the environment, the season,
  and the nutritional condition of the animal . Flesh from healthy fish contains 60–84%
  water, 15–24% protein and 0.1–22% fat; minerals usually constitute 1–2%. The proportions
  of the constituents are species-specific and the main variations between species
  are in the fat content. Fish are often classified according to fat content. Lean
  fish have &lt;0.5% fat, semi-fat fish contain 0.5–2% and fatty fish have more than
  2% . In this study, the lipid content ranged from 1.26% for scorpion fish to 18.12%
  for shad. The scorpion fish could be classified as a semi-fat fish. All the remaining
  fish could be classified as fatty fish. However, between the fatty fish, the highest
  fat content was determined in the shad flesh. The fat contents were shad &gt; anchovy
  &gt; blue fish &gt; red mullet &gt; belone &gt; scorpion fish. Sorting by the moisture
  content was scorpion fish &gt; red mullet ≥ belone &gt; blue fish &gt; anchovy &gt;
  shad. In general, there is an inverse relationship between the amount of fat and
  moisture in the flesh. As shown in Table 1, the moisture content in deep water species
  was more than in the pelagic species.\n\nThe protein content tends to vary much
  less widely from one species to another. Most fish contain approximately 20% protein
  . Also, in this research, the protein content of the fish varied from 14.54 to 20.26%.
  The ash content ranged from 0.76% for the blue fish to 1.25% for the belone.\n\nThe
  major carbohydrate in fish muscle is glycogen, which is a polymer of glucose. A
  typical muscle in a live fish may contain between 0.1 and 1% glycogen . In this
  research, the lowest carbohydrate content was obtained from the red mullet however,
  it was similar to the carbohydrate value of the other fish except for the anchovy.
  The energy value of the fish ranged from 82.84 to 243.74 cal, and the fat content
  together with the energy value, was determined as a linearly relationship.\n\nSimilar
  food compositions for the fish observed in this research have been determined by
  several other researchers .\n\n\n\n\n\nFatty acid composition of fish species  \n\n\n\n\nWithin
  a row values with different superscript letters are significantly different\n\nThe
  fatty acids composition of the fish species ranged from 27.83 to 35.91% saturated
  fatty acid, 19.50–33.80% monounsaturated fatty acid and 15.25–40.02% PUFA. It was
  observed that the proportion of these fatty acids changed significantly between
  the six fish species. Among them, those occurring in the highest proportions were
  myristic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, palmitoleic acid, oleic acid, linoleic
  acid, alpha-linolenic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid. These
  results are in line with previous studies on the fatty acids of other species .
  It was also observed that the proportion of these fatty acids vary among the species.\n\nThe
  SFA values were significantly different for the six fish species. The highest SFA
  value was obtained from the scorpion fish whose fat content was the lowest in all
  fish. This was followed by anchovy, blue fish and red mullet, belone and shad. Güner
  et al.  reported SFA ratios 40.77% for anchovy, 38.16% for red mullet, 35.87% for
  belone, 31.77% for shad. SFA ratios of anchovy by Kaya and Turan  were declared
  as 38.62, 35.20, and 33.57% in November, December and January, respectively. Öksüz
  and Özyılmaz  reported that SFA ratios of anchovy ranged from 37.91 to 34.04%. Tanakol
  et al.  determined SFA ratios 42.2% for anchovy, 34.4% for bluefish and 34.7% for
  belone. Bayır et al.  found SFA ratios in bluefish, anchovy and belone of 38.35,
  37.81, and 28.89%, respectively. Palmitic acid was the primary SFA, contributing
  to 57–66% of the total SFA content of lipids for all the fish species. These result
  is in line with previous studies on the fatty acids of other species . The highest
  16:0 content was detected in the scorpion fish, whereas the lowest value was found
  in the shad. The palmitic acid content in the anchovy and red mullet; belone and
  the blue fish were similar. Myristic acid was the secondary fatty acid for the pelagic
  fish species, whereas 18:0 was the secondary fatty acid for the deep water species.\n\nThe
  MUFA values were significantly different for all six fish species. The highest MUFA
  value was obtained from the red mullet, followed by the blue fish, belone and then
  the shad, whereas the lowest value was found in the anchovy. This result is in accordance
  with Güner et al.  who found that anchovy showed the lowest percentage of MUFA in
  other fish. Öksüz and Özyılmaz  reported monthly changes in the levels of the MUFA
  component throughout the catching season of anchovy. Oleic acid was the most represented
  of the MUFA, accounting for 60–74% of the total MUFA for all the fish. The highest
  18:1n-9 contents were obtained from the blue fish and the shad, followed by belone,
  the scorpion fish and the red mullet, whereas the lowest value was found in the
  anchovy. While the highest 16:1 value was obtained from the red mullet, the lowest
  value was found for the shad, and its contents were similar to the anchovy and the
  blue fish. This two fatty acid were determined as the major fatty acids in MUFA
  in also other studies .\n\nThe PUFA values were significantly different for the
  six fish species. The highest PUFA value was obtained from the belone, followed
  by anchovy, shad, scorpion fish, and blue fish, whereas the lowest value was found
  in the red mullet. This result is in accordance with Güner et al.  who found that
  red mullet showed the lowest percentage of PUFA in other fish. The major fatty acids,
  identified as PUFA, were 22:6n-3 and 20:5n-3, respectively. The highest proportion
  of 22:6n-3 in the total PUFA was obtained from the belone, followed by shad, blue
  fish and anchovy, whereas, the scorpion fish and red mullet contained lower 22:6n-3
  contents. Güner et al.  also determined a lower 22:6n-3 content in red mullet than
  anchovy, belone and shad. It was observed that the proportion of 22:6n-3 in the
  pelagic fish was higher than those in the deep water fish. Similarly, the high proportion
  of 20:5n-3 was detected in the red mullet and anchovy, followed by the scorpion
  fish, blue fish, shad, whereas the belone contained lower 20:5n-3 than the other
  fish. However, the 20:5n-3 values were anchovy &gt; scorpion fish &gt; shad &gt;
  red mullet &gt; blue fish ≥ belone. The 20:5n-3 values in the fish studied here
  were higher than those in the fish studied by Güner et al. . Also, the 22:6n-3 values
  in red mullet, belone and shad except for anchovy were higher than those in the
  fish studied by Güner et al. . In the PUFA, the 18:2n-6 contents ranged from 1.38%
  to 3.49%. The linoleic acid contents were similar to that of the anchovy with the
  scorpion fish at, shad with blue fish,, whereas the 18:3n-3 contents were significantly
  different in all the fish species, with a content range from 0.41% to 3.95%.\n\nThe
  British Nutrition Foundation  recommended that people who have a balanced and healthy
  diet consume 0.2 g of EPA and DHA daily. The American Heart Association recommends
  that all adults should include fish in their diet at least twice a week, especially
  oily fish , and for patients with documented coronary heart disease, the AHA recommends
  ≈ 1 g of EPA + DHA per day . This may be obtained from the consumption of oily fish
  or from n-3 fatty acid capsules, although the decision to use the latter should
  be made in consultation with a physician .\n\n\n\n\n\nAs shown in Table 3, the highest
  EPA + DHA value was obtained from the belone, followed by anchovy and shad, whereas
  the lowest values were found for the scorpion fish, blue fish and red mullet. To
  meet the EPA and DHA recommendations according to the British Nutrition Foundation,
  100 g of belone, anchovy and shad is enough but scorpion fish, blue fish and red
  mullet should be consumed in amounts higher than 100 g. This research indicates
  that very oily fish such as anchovy and shad have more EPA + DHA than semi-fat fish
  such as scorpion fish. However, belone is shown to be a very good source of EPA
  + DHA, despite the low amount of fat.\n\nIn the present study, it was observed that
  all the species had high levels of the n-3 series, ranging from 11.60% for red mullet
  and 34.89% for belone. However, the level of the n-6 series was detected as being
  low; ranging from 1.49% for the red mullet and 3.49% for belone. The level of the
  n-6 series of the shad, scorpion fish and blue fish were similar. Excessive amounts
  of n-6 PUFA and a very high n-6/n-3 ratio, as is found in today’s Western diets,
  promote the pathogenesis of many diseases; including cardiovascular disease, hypertension,
  depression, cancer, and inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, whereas increased
  levels of n-3 PUFA exert suppressive effects . Because of the low content of n-6
  fatty acids in marine fish, the ratio of the total n-3–n-6 fatty acids is high,
  varying from about 5, and reaching a ratio of more than 10 . In this research, the
  highest value of n-3/n-6 ratio was obtained from the shad, followed by belone and
  anchovy, whereas the lowest values were detected in the scorpion fish, red mullet
  and blue fish.\n\nIn conclusion, this research indicated that the belone, anchovy
  and shad in particular, are excellent food sources for EPA + DHA. In addition, the
  red mullet, blue fish and scorpion fish are also good sources of EPA + DHA.\n"
