  during high-temperature cooking and processing. This results not only in the formation
  of colour, aroma and flavour compounds, but also undesirable contaminants, including
  acrylamide, which forms when the amino acid that participates in the reaction is
  asparagine. In this study, tubers of 13 varieties of potato, which had been produced
  in a field trial in 2010 and sampled immediately after harvest or after storage
  for 6 months, were analysed to show the relationship between the concentrations
  of free asparagine, other free amino acids, sugars and acrylamide-forming potential.
  The varieties comprised five that are normally used for crisping, seven that are
  used for French fry production and one that is used for boiling. Acrylamide formation
  was measured in heated flour, and correlated with glucose and fructose concentration.
  In French fry varieties, which contain higher concentrations of sugars, acrylamide
  formation also correlated with free asparagine concentration, demonstrating the
  complex relationship between precursor concentration and acrylamide-forming potential
  in potato. Storage of the potatoes for 6 months at 9°C had a significant, variety-dependent
  impact on sugar and amino acid concentrations and acrylamide-forming potential.\n\n\n\n\n\nReducing
  sugars, such as glucose and fructose, react with free amino acids during high-temperature
  cooking and processing in a series of non-enzymatic reactions given the umbrella
  name of the Maillard reaction. The Maillard reaction results in the formation of
  a plethora of products, many of which impart colour, aroma and flavour. However,
  it also gives rise to some undesirable contaminants, including acrylamide. Acrylamide
  forms when the amino acid that participates in the reaction is asparagine. For simplicity
  we will refer to free asparagine and reducing sugars as precursors of acrylamide,
  although the carbon skeleton of acrylamide is derived entirely from asparagine.
  It should also be noted that other routes for acrylamide formation have been proposed.\n\nAcrylamide
  has been shown to be carcinogenic and to have neurological and reproductive effects
  in rodent toxicology studies. As a result, it has been classified as a Group 2A,
  probably carcinogenic to humans, chemical by the International Agency for Research
  on Cancer. The Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations and the World
  Health Organisation Joint Expert Committee on Food Additives recently concluded
  that the margin of exposure for acrylamide indicates that its presence in the human
  diet is a concern and that epidemiological studies using haemoglobin adducts of
  acrylamide itself, or its primary epoxide metabolite, glycidamide, as a measure
  of exposure were required to estimate the risk. To date, however, the results of
  epidemiological studies have been inconsistent. A recent meta-analysis of epidemiological
  data, for example, led the authors to conclude that there was no relationship between
  dietary acrylamide intake and cancer, while a later Danish study did find a link
  between acrylamide exposure and breast cancer-specific mortality. Another recent
  study showed a link between haemoglobin adducts of acrylamide and glycidamide in
  umbilical cord blood and low birth weight and head circumference in babies.\n\nGiven
  this uncertainty regarding the human health risk from acrylamide in the diet and
  the low margin of exposure, JECFA and other risk assessment bodies have recommended
  that acrylamide levels in food be reduced as a matter of priority and the European
  Commission issued indicative levels for acrylamide in food in early 2011. Indicative
  values are not safety thresholds, but are intended to indicate the need for an investigation
  into why the level has been exceeded. Fried potatoes and potato crisps are important
  contributors to dietary intake across Europe and indicative levels have been set
  at 1000 µg kg−1 for crisps and 600 µg kg−1 for French fries. The food industry has
  devised many strategies for reducing acrylamide formation by modifying food processing,
  and in Europe this has resulted in a significant downward trend for mean levels
  of acrylamide in potato crisps from 763 µg kg−1 in 2002 to 358 µg kg−1 in 2011,
  a decrease of 53%. Nevertheless, processors remain vulnerable to fluctuations in
  the acrylamide-forming potential of the crop products that make up their raw material.
  Developing best practice for crop cultivation and management, alongside variety
  selection and improvement, therefore, has an important part to play in acrylamide
  reduction strategies.\n\nA major management factor affecting the composition of
  potatoes is post-harvest storage. Glucose and fructose, for example, accumulate
  rapidly in stored potato tubers in response to the temperature falling below approximately
  8°C, sprouting or tuber senescence after long-term storage. Tubers are therefore
  usually stored at 8-10°C to prevent cold sweetening, while sprouting, which would
  occur at this temperature, is controlled by spraying with sprout suppressants such
  as chlorpropham.\n\nThe relationship between the concentrations of reducing sugars,
  free asparagine and other amino acids in potato tubers and acrylamide formation
  during cooking and processing is complicated, with separate studies concluding reducing
  sugar concentration, free asparagine concentration or free asparagine concentration
  as a proportion of the total free amino acid pool to be the determining factor.
  Recently, clear correlations have been shown between reducing sugar concentration
  and acrylamide-forming potential in nine varieties of potatoes grown commercially
  in the UK in 2009, but free asparagine and total free amino acid concentration also
  correlated significantly with acrylamide-forming potential in French fry but not
  crisping varieties, probably because French fry varieties contain higher concentrations
  of sugars. Another recent study modelled the kinetics of acrylamide formation in
  French fry production and concluded that both the fructose/glucose ratio and the
  ratio of asparagine to total free amino acids could affect acrylamide formation.\n\nClearly,
  the relationship between precursor concentration and acrylamide formation must be
  understood to enable food producers to select the most suitable varieties as the
  raw material for their products and to develop quality control measures where appropriate.
  A comprehensive understanding of the relationship is also essential for the identification
  of target traits for breeders. The aim of this study, therefore, was to add to the
  data on this complex issue by analysing 13 varieties of potatoes that had been grown
  in a field trial in 2010. The study also investigated the effect of storage on precursor
  concentration and acrylamide-forming potential.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe potatoes comprised
  13 varieties that had been produced in a field trial conducted at the Rothamsted
  farm site at Woburn, UK, in 2010. Nitrogen had been applied as ammonium nitrate
  at 0, 100 and 200 kg ha−1. Different levels of sulphur had also been applied but
  all of the potatoes used for this study had been grown with S supplied at 15 kg
  S ha−1. The potatoes had also received triple super phosphate2H2O) at 128 kg ha−1
  and muriate of potash at 458 kg ha−1, and the trial had been irrigated when required.
  The design of the field trial was a split-plot in three blocks, with N and S combinations
  on main plots and varieties on split-plots, with five plants per plot. Two of the
  three blocks were taken through to the storage part of the trial.\n\nThe tubers
  had been harvested from 28 September to 28 October 2010; some were analysed at harvest,
  while the rest were kept in a long-term storage facility at Sutton Bridge Crop Storage
  Research, UK, at 9°C until April 2011 and were analysed from the 5th to the 7th
  of that month. The sprout suppressant, CIPC was applied at 14 g per tonne on 12th
  November, 10th December and 23rd February.\n\n\n\nFree amino acids and sugars were
  measured in flour prepared from individual freeze-dried tubers. Free amino acids
  were derivatised and then analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry using
  an Agilent 5975 system in electron impact mode, as described previously. Note that
  arginine cannot be measured using this system, while cysteine concentrations were
  too low to measure accurately. Histidine data were acquired for the unstored samples
  but a problem with the injection port liners supplied with the EZFaast kit resulted
  in histidine giving variable peaks when the stored samples were being analysed and
  the data were considered unreliable.\n\nSugar concentrations were measured using
  a Dionex ion chromatography system with a 250 × 4 mm Carbopac™ PA1 column, operated
  using Chromeleon™ software, also as described previously. Acrylamide was measured
  in cooked potato flour after heating to 160°C for 20 min. The analysis was performed
  by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry using an Agilent 1200 high performance
  liquid chromatography system with 6410 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer with
  electrospray ion source in positive ion mode, as previously described.\n\n\n\nAnalysis
  of variance was used for each measured variable to assess the overall significance
  of main effects and interactions between varieties nested within cooking type, N
  and storage. For this analysis, the design was taken as a split-split plot, the
  second split reflecting the pairs of samples having derived from the same split-plot.
  Means of interest were then compared using corresponding least significant difference
  values at 5% based on the residual degrees of freedom from the ANOVA. A natural
  log transformation was used for all variables to account for some heterogeneity
  of variance, residuals then conforming to the assumptions of ANOVA. Pearsons correlation
  coefficient was calculated for variables of interest, for French fry and crisping
  varieties separately and together. Correlations were tested for statistical significance
  using the F-test. A multiple linear regression model for the transformed acrylamide
  data was then fitted, using the method of stepwise forward selection of most significant
  explanatory variables, then factors and finally interactions between terms already
  in the model. The GenStat VSN International Ltd, Hemel Hempstead, UK) statistical
  package was used for these analyses.\n\n\n\n\n\nThirteen varieties of potato had
  been grown in a randomised field trial at Woburn in Bedfordshire, UK, in 2010. The
  varieties comprised seven that are normally used for French fry production, five
  that are normally used for crisps, and one that is generally recommended only for
  boiling, although it is also sometimes described as suitable for baking.\n\nThe
  potato plants had been grown in three replicated blocks, each containing 45 plants
  of each of the 13 varieties. They had been supplied with different combinations
  of N and S fertiliser. This had shown that N application could increase the acrylamide-forming
  potential in potatoes but that the effect was type- and variety-dependent, while
  S application reduced glucose concentrations and mitigated the effect of high N
  application on the acrylamide-forming potential of some of the French fry-type potatoes.
  This study used two of the replicate blocks and analysed potatoes from plants that
  had been supplied with N at 0, 100 and 200 kg ha−1 together with S at 15 kg ha−1
  and that were either unstored or following storage. This gave potatoes with a wide
  range of precursor concentrations while keeping the number of biochemical analyses
  required at a feasible number. The application of S at 15 kg ha−1 was considered
  to be the closest of the three S treatments to the reality of commercial potato
  cultivation. Farmers rarely fertilise potatoes with S; however, the soil at the
  trial site is a sandy loam with very poor nutrient retention, with intrinsic S concentrations
  ranging from only 0.5-1.8 mg kg−1.\n\nFree amino acid and sugar concentrations were
  determined at harvest or shortly after and after 6 months storage at 9°C in a commercial
  storage facility. Acrylamide formation was measured in flour after heating at 160°C
  for 20 min. This method has already been used in several studies because it gives
  high levels of acrylamide formation, providing a good, consistent indication of
  acrylamide-forming potential in different raw materials. Note that free amino acid
  and acrylamide data were not obtained for unstored Daisy, Umatilla Russet and Harmony
  because of spoilage of the samples. Note also that arginine cannot be assayed by
  the method used, while cysteine concentrations were so low that they could not be
  measured accurately and histidine was omitted from the analysis of the stored samples
  because of an instrumentation problem. The entire dataset is presented in Appendix
  S1, Supporting Information.\n\nThe data were subjected to ANOVA, and the resulting
  P-values are given in Table 1. The analysis revealed significant differences between
  the types and varieties nested within types for free asparagine, many other amino
  acids, total free amino acids and the sugars with the exception of sucrose, which
  showed an effect of type but not variety. Type and variety nested within type also
  showed an interaction with storage, indicating that the types and varieties within
  types responded differently to storage, consistent with a previous study of commercially-grown
  potatoes. The relevant means on the natural loge scale for free asparagine, total
  free amino acids and the sugars are given in Table 2 and the back-transformed means
  are plotted for free asparagine and total free amino acids in Fig. 1 and for the
  sugars in Fig. 2.  \n\n\nFigure 1\\. Free asparagine concentrations and total free
  amino acid concentrations in ten potato varieties before storage and after storage.
  Data were not obtained for the other three varieties in the study due to spoilage
  of the samples. The total free amino acids did not include arginine, cysteine or,
  for the stored samples, histidine. Statistical analysis of the data is given in
  Tables 1 and 2.\n\n\nFigure 2\\. Concentrations of glucose, fructose and sucrose
  in 13 potato varieties before storage and after storage. Harmony is shown separately
  on a different scale in and because of its relatively high concentrations of glucose
  and fructose. Statistical analysis of the data is given in Tables 1 and 2.\n\n\nThere
  was a trend for free asparagine and total free amino acid concentrations to rise
  during storage, with significant increases in free asparagine for varieties Hermes,
  Saturna, Markies, Pentland Dell and Russet Burbank, and in total free amino acids
  for the same varieties as well as King Edward and Maris Piper. This meant that there
  were significant increases in total free amino acids in all of the French fry varieties.
  The French fry varieties also generally contained higher concentrations of glucose
  and fructose than the crisping type, and showed a trend for an increase in these
  reducing sugars during storage and for a decline in sucrose concentration, probably
  as a result of invertase activity, which is often associated with potatoes in storage.
  There were large increases in reducing sugars in King Edward, Pentland Dell, Russett
  Burbank and Umatilla Russett. In contrast, Daisy, Markies and Maris Piper showed
  little change in concentration of either reducing sugar even though sucrose concentration
  fell. These varieties also showed good stability during storage in a previous study.\n\nSucrose
  concentrations in the crisping varieties also fell, with the exception of Lady Rosetta,
  in which sucrose concentration actually rose. The concentrations of reducing sugars
  in Lady Rosetta also rose, suggesting that sucrose was being broken down but that
  the replenishing of sucrose concentrations through the breakdown of starch was occurring
  more rapidly in this variety. Both Lady Claire and Verdi showed a decrease in reducing
  sugar concentration during storage, resulting in them having the lowest reducing
  sugar concentrations of all the varieties at the end of the storage period. In contrast,
  the sucrose concentration in the boil type, Harmony was very low, while both fructose
  and glucose concentrations were extremely high and rose even higher through storage,
  suggesting high invertase activity.\n\nAcrylamide formation in heated flour was
  affected significantly by type, variety nested within type, storage, an interaction
  between type and storage, and by variety nested within type interacting with storage.
  The relevant means are given in Table 3 and the back-transformed means are plotted
  in Fig. 3. The raw means for the stored Harmony, Umatilla Russet and Daisy are also
  plotted for comparison. Acrylamide concentration is given in µg kg−1, which is equivalent
  to ppb and is the unit generally preferred by the food industry and regulatory authorities;
  1 µg kg−1 represents 14 nmol kg−1.  \n\n\nFigure 3\\. Acrylamide formation in tuber
  flour heated to 160°C for 20 minutes for 13 potato varieties before storage and
  after storage. Harmony is shown separately on a different scale because of the relatively
  high concentration of acrylamide that formed in flour from that variety. Back-transformed
  means from analysis of variance are shown except for Daisy, Umatilla Russet and
  Harmony, which were not included in the ANOVA because of spoilage of the unstored
  samples and for which the raw mean for the stored samples is shown for comparison.
  Statistical analysis of the data is given in Tables 1 and 3.\n\n\nAcrylamide concentrations
  in flour from the unstored potatoes ranged from 1745 µg kg−1 for Lady Rosetta to
  5191 µg kg−1 for Pentland Dell, the very high levels reflecting the method used
  to induce acrylamide formation. The amount of acrylamide that forms in heated potato
  flour is a measure of acrylamide-forming potential and commercial products would
  be expected to exhibit proportionally lower levels because of less severe heating.
  Nevertheless, such levels emphasise the necessity of controlling acrylamide formation
  through consistency in processing, and very high levels of acrylamide have been
  found in a small number of commercial potato crisp samples. There were significant
  increases after storage for crisping variety Lady Rosetta and French fry varieties
  King Edward, Pentland Dell and Russet Burbank, with Pentland Dell and Russet Burbank
  producing 9816 and 7957 µg kg−1 acrylamide, respectively. Markies and Verdi, on
  the other hand, actually showed a decrease, albeit not significant, in acrylamide
  formation after storage. The stored Umatilla Russett and Harmony potatoes showed
  the highest levels of acrylamide, with 11 550 and 20 160 µg kg−1, respectively.\n\nThe
  effect of N was not considered in this study or included in Table 1 because it has
  been reported on already but, because samples from three different N treatments
  were analysed, it had to be included in the ANOVA. So, for the record, there was
  a significant N by storage interaction for amino acids glycine, threonine, serine,
  asparagine, glutamine, glutamic acid, lysine and tyrosine, a main effect of N for
  proline, and a type by N interaction for sucrose. There were no significant interactions
  between type, N and storage, or between variety nested in type, N and storage for
  any measured variable.\n\n\n\nThe data were analysed for correlations between precursor
  concentration and acrylamide formation and the results for glucose, fructose, free
  asparagine and acrylamide formation in flour are shown in Fig. 4A-4C. The analysis
  showed a strong correlation between glucose concentration and acrylamide formation
  in the complete dataset and in the French fry varieties analysed separately. No
  significant correlation was evident in the crisping varieties but this was affected
  by the very narrow range of glucose concentrations in these varieties, and notably
  the data points lie on the same relationship as those from the French fry and boil
  types, albeit clustered at one end of it. There was much less spread in the glucose
  data for the crisping varieties obtained in this study, in which all of the varieties
  were grown together in the same field trial, than in the data obtained from potatoes
  that had been grown at different sites by commercial suppliers. This suggests that
  these varieties are genetically very similar with respect to this trait, possibly
  as a result of their being bred for low glucose concentration over many years, in
  which case further reductions in glucose concentration may be difficult to achieve.
  Similar results were obtained for fructose.\n\nFigure 4\\. Graphs showing correlations
  between precursor concentration and acrylamide formation in potato flour heated
  to 160°C for 20 min. Glucose concentration and acrylamide formation. Fructose concentration
  and acrylamide formation. Free asparagine concentration and acrylamide formation.
  Points on the graphs from French fry varieties are denoted by F in black, while
  those for crisping varieties are denoted by C in red and the boiling variety, Harmony,
  in green, the results for correlation being given for all three types overall and
  then for French fry and crisping types separately. The points are codes for the
  varieties Maris Piper, Pentland Dell, King Edward, Daisy, Markies, Russet Burbank,
  Umatilla Russet, Lady Claire, Lady Rosetta, Saturna, Hermes, Verdi and Harmony,
  followed by unstored or stored. All concentrations are shown on a dry weight basis.\n\n\nThe
  analysis also showed a significant but weak correlation between free asparagine
  concentration and acrylamide formation, overall, although more strongly in the French
  fry varieties. In contrast, there was no significant correlation in the crisping
  varieties and, in this case, the lack of a correlation could not be explained by
  the range of the data points, which was greater in the crisping than in the French
  fry varieties.\n\n\n\nPrevious studies have suggested that the ratio of free asparagine
  to total free amino acids could be an important determinant of acrylamide-forming
  potential, because other free amino acids could compete with asparagine in the final
  stages of the Maillard reaction. This would be consistent with the significant reduction
  in acrylamide formation that has been achieved by adding amino acids to potato or
  cereal products, or to model systems, before heating, and manipulating this parameter
  could have the benefit of reducing acrylamide formation while having relatively
  little effect on the production of desirable colour, flavour and aroma compounds
  that also derive from the Maillard reaction. In order to assess the variation in
  this trait between the different varieties, free asparagine concentration was plotted
  against total free amino acid concentration. This showed a close correlation between
  the two, meaning that there was little variation in the ratio of free asparagine
  to total free amino acids and it was not possible to assess the importance of this
  parameter from this dataset.\n\nFigure 5\\. Graphs showing correlations between
  metabolite concentrations in potato tubers: Total free amino acid and free asparagine
  concentration;. Glucose and fructose concentration. Points on the graphs from French
  fry varieties are denoted by F in black, while those for crisping varieties are
  denoted by C in red and the boiling variety, Harmony, in green, the results for
  correlation being given for all three types overall and then for French fry and
  crisping types separately. The points are codes for the varieties Maris Piper, Pentland
  Dell, King Edward, Daisy, Markies, Russet Burbank, Umatilla Russet, Lady Claire,
  Lady Rosetta, Saturna, Hermes, Verdi and Harmony, followed by unstored or stored.
  All concentrations are shown on a dry weight basis. The total free amino acids did
  not include arginine, cysteine or, for the stored samples, histidine.\n\n\nAnother
  ratio that was suggested as potentially important by Parker et al. was that of fructose
  to glucose, the authors suggesting that a high fructose: glucose ratio could favour
  desirable products of the Maillard reaction over acrylamide. However, a plot of
  fructose against glucose showed that the concentrations of these two reducing sugars
  were also closely related.\n\n\n\nA model for the acrylamide data was derived using
  regression analysis with stepwise forward selection of most significant terms. This
  involves testing the addition of each variable to the model and adding the variable
  that improves the model the most. The process is repeated until no further variables
  improve the model. The best model was: \n\n\nFigure 6\\. Observed acrylamide levels
  plotted against levels predicted by the regression model Log(Acrylamide) = Constant
  + b1Fructose + b2Sucrose + b3Asn + b4Pro + b5Glucose + b6Tyr + Varietyi + FructoseVarietyi
  for 13 varieties of potato: Maris Piper, Pentland Dell, King Edward, Daisy, Markies,
  Russet Burbank, Umatilla Russet, Lady Claire, Lady Rosetta, Saturna, Hermes, Verdi
  and Harmony. The line indicates the 1:1 relationship.\n\n\nAsparagine also contributed
  to acrylamide variance, as did two other amino acids, proline and tyrosine, and
  there was an additional effect of variety that was not explained by amino acids
  or sugars plus a variety by fructose interaction. These last effects indicate that
  a genetic component is involved, and that even within-variety changes in levels
  of sugars can be important. There is no current explanation for the contribution
  of tyrosine to the variance from what is known about the chemistry of acrylamide
  formation. Proline has been shown to inhibit acrylamide formation rather than increase
  it but that would be unlikely to occur when proline is present at much lower concentrations
  than asparagine, as is the case here. Importantly, the effects of storage and N
  were not significant in the model so there are no fundamental shifts in acrylamide
  with respect to such factors.\n\nA similar analysis has been performed with data
  on acrylamide formation in heated rye flour. The model arrived at in that case was:
  \n\nRegression analysis is a purely statistical exercise, but the contrasting models
  do reflect the fact that free asparagine concentration is the major determinant
  of acrylamide-forming potential in cereal flour, while sugars are more important
  in potato, and the fact that other amino acids than asparagine contribute to the
  variance in both models suggests that this is worthy of further investigation.\n\n\n\nEstablishing
  the relationship between acrylamide precursor concentration in potatoes and the
  formation of acrylamide during cooking and processing is extremely important to
  enable food producers to achieve optimal quality control. Breeders are also more
  likely to invest in programmes aimed at reducing acrylamide-forming potential in
  potato if they are confident that the correct target traits have been identified.
  However, despite a decade of study, it has remained an intractable problem, with
  different studies showing reducing sugar concentration, free asparagine concentration
  or free asparagine concentration as a proportion of the total free amino acid pool
  to be the determining factor. This is in contrast to the situation in wheat and
  rye, for example, where free asparagine concentration is clearly the key parameter.\n\nRecently
  we reported that glucose and fructose showed the best correlations with acrylamide
  formation in both crisps and heated flour produced from nine varieties of potatoes
  grown commercially in the UK in 2009. However, free asparagine and total free amino
  acid concentrations also correlated with acrylamide formation in French fry varieties.
  In this study we analysed a larger number of varieties in a controlled field trial.
  As in the previous study, while glucose and fructose concentrations showed the best
  correlations with acrylamide formation, free asparagine was shown to contribute
  to the variance in the French fry varieties. This means that two studies have now
  shown free asparagine concentration to be an important contributor to acrylamide-forming
  potential in French fry varieties but not crisping varieties.\n\nAnother recent
  study modelled the kinetics of acrylamide formation in French fry production and
  concluded that both the fructose/glucose ratio and the ratio of asparagine to total
  free amino acids could affect acrylamide formation. That study used potatoes of
  variety Ranger Russet, a popular French fry variety in the USA that was not included
  in this study. However, our finding that free asparagine concentration correlated
  with acrylamide formation in the French fry varieties is consistent with the predictions
  of the kinetic model. Total free amino acid concentrations also correlated positively
  with acrylamide formation in this study for French fry varieties, which might appear
  to be at odds with the model. However, total free amino acid concentrations also
  correlated closely with free asparagine concentration, and a different picture could
  emerge if total free amino acid concentration could be uncoupled from free asparagine
  concentration. Similarly, glucose and fructose concentrations correlated closely
  in all of the samples, so the dataset did not test that aspect of the kinetic model
  either. Clearly, there are many varieties and genotypes of potato beyond those that
  were analysed here, but the data suggest that naturally occurring genotypes in which
  these relationships between precursors are different from the norm may be rare.\n\nVery
  low free asparagine concentration has been achieved in genetically modified potatoes
  in which asparagine synthetase gene expression in the tubers has been reduced by
  RNA interference. These potatoes were reported to give good colour when fried, supporting
  the hypothesis that targeting free asparagine concentrations could enable acrylamide-forming
  potential to be reduced without compromising the characteristics that consumers
  demand in fried and roasted potato products. The strategy of targeting asparagine
  synthesis specifically in the tuber makes sense because asparagine has been shown
  not to be a major transported amino acid in potato, so the free asparagine that
  accumulates in tubers must be synthesised there. Potatoes with low free asparagine
  rather than reducing sugar concentration could be suitable for home cooking, where
  most consumers use colour development to assess when roasted or fried potatoes have
  been cooked sufficiently. The implications of the acrylamide issue for home cooking
  have received very little attention so far.\n\nCurrently there is no market for
  GM potatoes even in the USA and there will be a lot of interest in the attitude
  of the all-important American fast-food industry and consumers to low acrylamide
  GM potatoes if and when such varieties are commercialised. There is, of course,
  no prospect of a GM variety being developed for the European market in the foreseeable
  future. However, there are steps that food manufacturers can take in conjunction
  with growers to ensure that they have the best possible raw material to keep acrylamide
  formation in their products as low as reasonably achievable. The first is variety
  selection; in this study the acrylamide formed in heated flour in the crisping varieties
  before storage ranged from 1745 to 2746 µg kg−1, a difference of 36%, and in the
  French fry varieties it ranged from 2034 to 5191 µg kg−1. Clearly it is essential
  to select the right type of potato and, if possible, the best variety within the
  type, although other factors will also have to be considered, from the varietys
  suitability for a particular environment to the quality of the product that can
  be made with it.\n\nThe second consideration is management of the crop, with the
  most important management factor identified to date being storage. In this and a
  previous study, storage had a significant, variety-dependent impact on acrylamide-forming
  potential, with sugar and amino acid concentrations changing markedly, and an increase
  in reducing sugar concentrations driving up acrylamide-forming potential in most
  varieties. The results emphasised the importance of not using potatoes to make foods
  in which acrylamide may form if they have been kept beyond their recommended storage
  window. The varieties that were most stable during the 6-month storage period used
  in this study were Lady Claire and Verdi from the crisping types and Markies and
  Maris Piper from the French fry types. Two of the varieties in the trial, Lady Rosetta
  and Pentland Dell, are regarded as having particularly rigid storage windows, with
  both having a reputation for exhibiting senescent sweetening relatively early in
  storage. Both of these varieties showed large increases in reducing sugar concentration
  after storage in this study, emphasising the importance of processing them after
  short- to medium-term storage and not holding them long-term. King Edward, Russet
  Burbank, Umatilla Russet and Harmony also showed large increases in reducing sugars
  after storage.\n\nThe food industry has worked hard to reduce the levels of acrylamide
  in its products and there has been impressive progress in some sectors, with levels
  of acrylamide in potato crisps in Europe, for example, falling by 53% between 2002,
  when acrylamide was first discovered in food, and 2011. There is certainly an expectation
  within the food industry that plant breeders will engage with the issue with the
  same determination, and some frustration that there has not been more progress.
  It is important that potato breeders make reduced acrylamide-forming potential a
  priority and that they have sufficient information on the genetics underlying what
  is undoubtedly a complex trait. The important conclusion from this study is that
  free asparagine as well as reducing sugar concentration should be a target. Indeed,
  we concur with the conclusion of Parker et al. that reducing the concentration of
  free asparagine as a proportion of the total free amino acid pool would be the most
  likely way of reducing acrylamide formation in potato products while retaining the
  characteristics that define products and are demanded by consumers, bearing in mind
  again that compounds responsible for colour, flavour and aroma form by similar pathways
  to acrylamide.\n\n\n\nThe study was supported financially by the Biotechnology and
