  The aim of this study was to evaluate the oxidative stability of sardine muscle
  lipids as related to the storage conditions. Whole sardines were stored at 4 °C
  for 4 h under light exposure and at dark. The lowest levels of peroxide value, thiobarbituric
  acid reactive substances, cholesterol oxidation products and the highest level of
  polyunsaturated fatty acids content, especially PUFA n − 3, were found in the untreated
  sardines. After light exposure, PUFA dramatically dropped and a marked increase
  of PV, TBARs and COPs was observed; under darkness, the values of the oxidation
  parameters were similar to those found in untreated sardines. Although cholesterol
  oxidation rate did not exceed 0.9%, further research is required about toxicity
  levels of the single COPs, to better understand if the COPs levels found in untreated
  and photoxidized muscle do not represent a risk for human health.'
