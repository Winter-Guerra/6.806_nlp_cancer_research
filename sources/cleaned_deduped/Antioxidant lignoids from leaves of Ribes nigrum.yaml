  Phytochemical investigation of the leaves of Ribes nigrum resulted in the isolation
  of fourteen compounds, including four 7,7′-epoxylignans, three tetrahydrofuran-type
  sesquilignans, and a spirocyclic dilignan. Their structures were elucidated by extensive
  spectroscopic analyses and by chemical transformations. The isolated compounds were
  evaluated for their antioxidant activities using superoxide anion scavenging assay
  and DPPH free radical scavenging assay. Ribesin D and ribesin G showed the most
  potent superoxide anion scavenging activity with EC50 values of 1.24 and 1.12 Î¼M,
  respectively, and the structure-activity relationship was discussed.'
