  intensity physical activity per week, alcohol intake of ≤1 drink per day, and maintaining
  a body mass index of ;25 kg/m2 for breast cancer prevention. Adherence to these
  guidelines has been linked to lower overall mortality in average-risk populations,
  it is not known if mortality reduction extends to women at higher risk given their
  family history of breast cancer. We followed 2,905 women from a high-risk Breast
  Cancer Family Registry in New York, of which 77 % were white non-Hispanic and 23
  % were Hispanic. We collected information on BMI, physical activity, and alcohol
  intake at baseline and prospectively followed our cohort for outcomes based on questionnaires
  and National Death Index linkage. We used Cox regression to examine the relation
  between adherence to ACS guidelines and overall mortality and examined effect modification
  by race, age, and BRCA status. There were 312 deaths after an average of 9.2 ± 4.1
  years of follow-up. Adherence to all three ACS recommendations was associated with
  44–53 % lower mortality in women unaffected with breast cancer at baseline  and
  in women affected with breast cancer at baseline . These associations remained after
  stratification by age, race, and BRCA status {e.g., BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 carriers
  }. These results support that women at high risk, similar to women at average risk,
  may also have substantial benefits from maintaining the ACS guidelines.\n\n\n\nBreast
  cancer risk Lifestyle behaviors Mortality Racial/ethnic disparities Prevention\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe
  American Cancer Society recommends health guidelines for breast cancer prevention
  that include lifestyle behaviors for regular physical activity, moderate alcohol
  consumption, and maintaining a healthy body mass index . The current recommendations
  for women are as follows: “to be as lean as possible throughout life without being
  underweight”; “to get at least 150 min of moderate intensity or 75 min of vigorous
  intensity activity each week preferably spread throughout the week”; and “to drink
  no more than one drink per day” .\n\nEpidemiological studies have provided evidence
  that individuals who adhere to these ACS guidelines and other similar health guidelines
  on physical activity, alcohol consumption, and body size have better health outcomes
  including reduced risk of chronic disease, including diabetes, myocardial infarction,
  stroke, and cancer  as well as reduced mortality . For example, recent results from
  a large European cohort consisting of nearly 400,000 participants from the World
  Cancer Research Fund/American Institute for Cancer Research indicate that there
  is an 18 % reduction in incidence of total cancers  and a 34 % reduction in mortality
  when comparing those in the highest group of adherence to the lowest group . Similarly,
  in the U.S. in an ACS cohort of 100,000 men and women from 21 different states with
  population-based cancer registries, those who adhered to ACS cancer prevention guidelines
  had a 42 % reduction in all-cause mortality and a 24 % reduction in cancer-specific
  mortality . In addition to mortality reductions, adherence to ACS guidelines has
  also been associated with lower cancer incidence. For example, in a cohort of over
  93,000 postmenopausal women enrolled from 40 U.S. clinical centers, adherence to
  ACS cancer prevention guidelines was associated with a 22 % reduction in the incidence
  of breast cancer, a 52 % reduction of colorectal cancer incidence, and a 27 % reduction
  in endometrial cancer incidence . Women who adhered to cancer prevention guidelines
  had a 27 % reduction in all-cause mortality, a 61 % lower risk of colorectal cancer
  death, and a 33 % lower risk of death from breast cancer .\n\nThese cohorts suggest
  a large unrealized potential for cancer prevention in populations at average risk
  of cancer. Family history of cancer dramatically increases risk of most cancers
  including breast cancer, of which only a portion is explained by mutations in BRCA1
  and BRCA2 genes  and other highly penetrant genes . Despite the increased risk in
  many cancers from a family history of cancer, some studies suggest that family members
  may not adhere to cancer prevention guidelines. For example, the largest U.S.-based
  family cohort, the Sister Study , found that only 12 % of women with a sister affected
  with breast cancer adhere to all three guidelines . Further, the Sister Study found
  that there was substantial heterogeneity in meeting these guidelines by women of
  different racial and ethnic groups . Specifically, they found that only 12.7 % of
  white women and 4.5 % of black women met all three guidelines .\n\nGiven that adherence
  to cancer prevention guidelines has been shown to substantially reduce mortality
  in average-risk cohorts, we investigated whether this reduction in mortality from
  meeting the ACS breast cancer guidelines holds in higher risk populations in ethnically
  diverse women from our New York Breast Cancer Family Registry. Specifically, we
  examined the effect of adhering to ACS Guidelines for breast cancer prevention in
  the United States, across white and Hispanic women with a family history or personal
  history of breast cancer. The recommendations include adherence to physical activity,
  alcohol intake, and body mass index guidelines. We evaluated levels of adherence
  with respect to all-cause mortality.\n\n\n\nThe Breast Cancer Family Registry, established
  in 1995, is a collaborative project with participants from six research sites in
  the USA, Canada, and Australia . For this study, we included participants from the
  New York site of the BCFR , a clinic-based site that identified participants along
  with family members based on the following criteria: a female with either breast
  or ovarian cancer age 45 or less at diagnosis; a male with a history of breast cancer;
  a female with a history of both breast and ovarian cancer; a female with one first-degree
  relative or two second-degree relatives with a history of either breast or ovarian
  cancer; a family with a known BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation. We included women who completed
  a baseline questionnaire, identified themselves as either ‘White/Caucasian’ or ‘Hispanic/Latina’,
  and for whom height, weight, physical activity, and alcohol intake data were available.
  1,000 women were affected with breast cancer at enrollment and 1,905 women were
  unaffected relatives of those with breast cancer. For these analyses, we examined
  women in two separate cohorts, those who were affected with breast cancer at the
  time of baseline and those who were unaffected women from families with a history
  of breast cancer. We inlcuded outcomes through December 31, 2012, the endpoint for
  the start of analyses. The Institutional Review Board of Columbia University Medical
  Center approved the study and all participants provided informed consent.\n\nWe
  calculated BMI based on self-reported height and weight at baseline  and categorized
  BMI according to ACS guidelines. We asked women to report their average hours per
  week of moderate physical activity and strenuous exercise from the previous three
  years. We categorized physical activity to assess adherence to ACS guidelines. Alcohol
  consumption per week in the last 3 years was self-reported and included details
  regarding beer, wine or wine coolers, and hard liquor consumption. We categorized
  alcohol consumption according to ACS guidelines. We evaluated confounding based
  on data from the baseline questionnaire including education, age, smoking status,
  history of mammogram, and hormone replacement therapy use at baseline. We calculated
  the number of first- and second-degree family members with breast cancer from self
  and relative reported family history. We obtained vital status through self or relative
  report at follow-up and matching of participants to the National Death Index. In
  the analyses, we considered NDI-reported deaths if NDI assigned scores that met
  recommended criteria .\n\nWe tested the associations between adherence to ACS guidelines
  and all-cause mortality using Cox proportional hazards models and tested for confounding
  by age at baseline, education, smoking, number of relatives with breast cancer,
  mammogram history, and HRT use through a 10 % change in the beta coefficient for
  the categorical constructs representing adherence. In addition, we assessed interaction
  with race, age, and BRCA status through stratified analyses and statistical tests
  of multiplicative interaction. We used adherence to 1 ACS recommendation as the
  reference due to small samples in the 0 adherence group. We used SAS 9.3 to conduct
  all statistical analyses.\n\n\n\nWe included 2,905 women in this study, 2,248 white
  women and 657 Hispanic women, and followed them for an average of 9.17 ± 4.12 years
  during which time 312 deaths occurred. The mean age ± SD for white and Hispanic
  women was 50 ± 15.2 and 45 ± 15.2 years, respectively. Compared to Hispanics, white
  women were more likely to report some college degree or higher, were less likely
  to report being overweight or obese, and were less likely to report smoking or alcohol
  consumption. White women were also more likely to be past or current users of hormone
  replacement therapy. Fewer women in the affected cohort reported never smoking compared
  to unaffected women. As expected, almost all the women who were affected with breast
  cancer reported having had a mammogram, though within the unaffected cohort white
  women were more likely to have had a recent screening mammogram as compared to Hispanic
  women. On average, affected Hispanic women reported less exercise than affected
  white women.\n\n\n\n\n\nNote negligible missing data for most variables\n\n\n\n\nApproximately,
  half the women who were unaffected with breast cancer at the time of enrollment
  adhered to the ACS guidelines for physical activity and BMI &lt;25 kg/m2. However,
  white women were more likely to exercise ≥150 min/week and were more likely to have
  a BMI &lt;25 kg/m2 than Hispanic women. The majority of unaffected women adhered
  with the alcohol consumption guideline of &lt;1 drink per day, though Hispanic women
  were more adherent than white women. Overall, the majority of women in the unaffected
  cohort did not adhere to all three of the ACS guidelines, though white women were
  more likely to report adherence to all three.\n\n\nWomen in the NY site of the BCFR
  without breast cancer at baseline and ACS adherence  \n\n\nWomen who were affected
  with breast cancer at the time of enrollment had moderate adherence to the ACS guidelines
  for physical activity and BMI &lt;25 kg/m2. However, white women were more likely
  to exercise ≥150 min/week and were more likely to maintain a BMI &lt;25 kg/m2. White
  women and Hispanic women who were affected with breast cancer were equally adherent
  with the alcohol consumption of &lt;1 drink/day. Overall, women affected with breast
  cancer were not adherent with ACS guidelines. However, white women were more likely
  to report adherence to all three recommendations.\n\nAfter adjusting for age and
  education, we observed a 44–53 % reduction in rate of overall mortality in the unaffected)
  and affected groups. We did not observe confounding by the other factors considered.
  The inverse associations with adherence and mortality remained after stratification
  by age but the association was only statistically significant in unaffected women
  ≥50 years and in affected women &lt;50 years . Adherence to all three guidelines
  was associated with a 27 % reduced mortality 95 % CI in unaffected women &lt;50
  years and 32 % reduced mortality 95 % CI in affected women &gt;50 years. The inverse
  association with adherence remained in all groups except for unaffected Hispanic
  women, after stratification by race and ethnicity. Stratification by BRCA carrier
  status showed that adherence to all three recommendations was associated with a
  61 % lower mortality ; adherence to all three recommendations in non-carriers was
  associated with a 50 % lower mortality .\n\n\nMultivariable models examining ACS
  adherence at baseline and overall survival in white and Hispanic women at the NY
  site of the BCFR  \n\n\n\n\nMultivariable models examining ACS adherence at baseline
  and overall survival by age in women at the NY site of the BCFR\n\n\nMultivariable
  models examining ACS adherence at baseline and overall survival by carrier status
  in women at the NY site of the BCFR\n\n\n\nWomen in our cohort who reported adherence
  to all three ACS guidelines had a 44–53 % reduction in all-cause mortality as compared
  with women who were only adhered to one guideline. Only 3.0 % of our cohort reported
  not adhering to any of the three ACS guidelines, which limited separate analysis
  of this group. These results remained after examining confounding by age at baseline,
  education, smoking, number of relatives with breast cancer, mammogram history, and
  HRT use. These results are also consistent with other cohort studies with participants
  of average risk including the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and
  Nutrition  where participants who adhered to zero out of four health recommendations
  had a four-fold increase in all-cause mortality, as well as the Cancer Prevention
  Study II Nutrition Cohort  and the Women’s Health Initiative  which showed a 42
  and 27 % reduction of all-cause mortality, respectively, when comparing those most
  adherent to American Cancer Society guidelines to those least adherent.\n\nWomen
  with a first-degree relative with breast cancer have a two-fold increased risk of
  developing breast cancer in their lifetime , which is substantially higher based
  on the ages of onset of the relatives. Although women with a genetic mutation at
  the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene are at substantially higher lifetime risk, only 5–10 % of
  women with a family history are carriers . Women in our cohort are at an overall
  higher risk than women in the general population. Ten-year breast cancer risks observed
  in this cohort were 7.03 % for women 35–49 years and 8.49 % for women 50 years and
  above; 3.1 times that of an average-risk population when comparing to age-standardized
  SEER rates . Despite having a personal history of breast cancer, only 28.2 % were
  adherent to all three guidelines for physical activity, maintaining a healthy BMI,
  and alcohol consumption and only 31.6 % of unaffected women from families at high
  risk for breast cancer were adherent to all three guidelines. While adherence was
  low in our cohort, it should be noted that the majority of women reported adherence
  with the recommendation for one or less alcoholic beverage per day. The rates of
  adherence were considerably lower for maintaining a healthy BMI and participating
  in physical activity for at least 150 min each week. However, differences in reporting
  of these three constructs may affect some of the adherence as measured.\n\nAdherence
  was low across all subgroups, although white women were more adherent with all three
  lifestyle behaviors combined as compared to Hispanic women. This same trend held
  for each of the individual behaviors except for alcohol consumption. While white
  and Hispanic women were equally adherent in the affected cohort, white women were
  less adherent than Hispanic women in the unaffected cohort. These results are consistent
  with other high-risk cohorts. Spector et al.  showed that white and black women
  who are sisters of women with breast cancer had low adherence to recommendations
  for physical activity and maintaining a healthy BMI. However, black women were more
  likely to comply with ACS alcohol recommendations . A prospective cohort study by
  Thomson et al. showed that cancer incidence, all-cause, and cancer-specific mortality
  were reduced through adherence to a greater number of ACS guidelines which suggests
  that adherence to ACS recommendations can be beneficial across all subgroups . Furthermore
  this same cohort  showed benefits from adherence in affected women and all-cause
  mortality across racial and ethnic subgroups; an important finding as many minority
  populations are often diagnosed at later stages of disease and experience worse
  outcomes .\n\nBreast cancer incidence, particularly for cancer with distal involvement
  is increasing in young women . The increase is seen across all racial and ethnic
  subgroups but the rate of increase is higher in non-white women . Both Hispanic
  and black women are more likely to present at a later stage at the time of diagnoses
  and have higher rates of breast cancer-specific mortality than non-Hispanic white
  women . The Sister’s Study indicates differences in adherence with cancer prevention
  guidelines between white and black women , and our data indicate that there are
  similar differences between white and Hispanic women in adherence. Continuing to
  urge clinicians to advise all patients and their families to adhere to cancer prevention
  guidelines is an obvious first step. However, our study along with the existing
  evidence suggests that specific recognition and solutions need to be addressed so
  that interventions can be targeted to groups with the greatest need.\n\nThis large,
  prospective cohort is focused on women that are higher risk for breast cancer from
  their family history. Due to smaller numbers than some of the very large cohorts,
  we were not able to consider cancer-specific mortality. As we relied on self report,
  it is possible that women reported adherence to the guidelines when in actuality
  they would not have adhered. This would be non-differential misclassification, however,
  as all participants from this cohort reported their adherence at baseline without
  knowing their outcomes. Therefore, associations may be even stronger than we estimated
  if there are no large unmeasured confounders. Although we were able to consider
  empirical confounding by a number of factors, as our exposures were not randomized
  it is possible that the effects observed would be smaller if there are large, unmeasured,
  positive confounders. Because the data for physical activity, alcohol consumption,
  and body size were collected at baseline, we were also unable to address whether
  adherence to these guidelines later in life reduces mortality as it is possible
  that the women who complied with the guidelines have been engaging in healthy behaviors
  throughout their life.\n\nFor women not already meeting guidelines, clinical trials
  focused on changing behaviors later in life support the challenge of long-term maintenance
  of lifestyle changes . As research may indicate that behavior changes later in life
  have a lower probability of being maintained, families at high risk of breast cancer
  should be informed at an earlier stage in life that making healthy behavioral changes
  with respect to alcohol consumption, physical activity, and maintaining a healthy
  weight have positive benefits associated with a reduction in overall mortality .
  Breast cancer prevention, such as changes in these reported lifestyle behaviors,
  are most likely to have the greatest impact when initiated earlier in life and maintained
  over the lifecourse .\n\nThe magnitude of the associations we observed was as large
  as or larger than many other primary, secondary, and tertiary breast cancer prevention
  interventions. For example, mammography screening is associated with a 19 % reduction
  in mortality with a greater reduction in mortality for screening over age 50 . Chemopreventive
  medications have also been linked with reduced risk in high-risk women as well as
  adjuvant treatment for women with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancers in the
  range of 31–67 % and a reduction in breast cancer mortality of 30 % . Our findings
  suggest a large potential for reduced mortality from following these guidelines.
  However, adherence to these behaviors is currently low in the general population
  \ as well as in high-risk cohorts . Adherence across high-risk minority groups is
  even lower . Adherence to chemoprevention and mammography screening, in contrast,
  is much higher in high-risk cohorts with regular mammography screening and five-year
  use of chemoprevention of tamoxifen with 40–83 %  and 41–72 %  adherence, respectively.
  Thus, substantial gains can be made in primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention
  in all women, and especially those at higher risk, from improving adherence with
  screening, chemoprevention, and alcohol, physical activity, and body size guidelines.\n\n\n\nIn
  summary, we found that among women with a family or personal history of breast cancer,
  adherence to all three ACS breast cancer prevention guidelines for physical activity,
  alcohol consumption, and maintaining a healthy weight was associated with a reduction
  in mortality compared to women who were only adherent to one guideline. Even in
  white and Hispanic women with a family history of breast cancer, adherence with
  the three cancer prevention guidelines remained low. Substantial gains can be made
  in prevention for women, especially those at high risk based on family history,
  by improving adherence to these lifestyle behaviors.\n\n\n\nThis work was supported
