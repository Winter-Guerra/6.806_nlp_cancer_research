  resistance to this agent in tumors. Retinoic acid facilitates the growth of mammary
  carcinoma cells which express high levels of fatty acid-binding protein 5. This
  protein delivers retinoic acid to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor β/δ
  that targets genes involved in cell proliferation and survival. One approach to
  overcome resistance of mammary carcinoma cells to retinoic acid is to target and
  suppress the FABP5/ PPARβ/δ pathway. The objective of this research was to investigate
  the effect of curcumin, a polyphenol extract from the plant Curcuma longa, on the
  FABP5/ PPARβ/δ pathway in retinoic acid resistant triple negative breast cancer
  cells. \n\n\n\nCell viability and proliferation of triple negative breast cancer
  cell lines treated with curcumin and/or retinoic was analyzed using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
  bromide and 5-bromo-2’-deoxyuridine. Expression level of FABP5 and PPARβ/δ in these
  cells treated with curcumin was examined by Western Blotting analysis and Quantitative
  Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction. Effect of curcumin and retinoic acid on PPARβ/δ
  target genes, PDK1and VEGF-A were also examined using qRT-PCR. Western Blotting
  was utilized to examine the protein expression level of the p65 subunit of NF-κB.
  \n\n\n\nTreatment of retinoic acid resistant triple negative breast cancer cells
  with curcumin sensitized these cells to retinoic acid mediated growth suppression,
  as well as suppressed incorporation of BrdU. Further studies demonstrated that curcumin
  showed a marked reduction in the expression level of FABP5 and PPARβ/δ. We provide
  evidence that curcumin suppresses p65, a transcription factor known to regulate
  FABP5. The combination of curcumin with retinoic acid suppressed PPARβ/δ target
  genes, VEGF-A and PDK1. \n\n\n\nCurcumin suppresses the expression level of FABP5
  and PPARβ/δ in triple negative mammary carcinoma cells. By targeting the FABP5/PPARβ/δ
  pathway, curcumin prevents the delivery of retinoic acid to PPARβ/δ and suppresses
  retinoic acid-induced PPARβ/δ target gene, VEGF-A. Our data demonstrates that suppression
  of the FABP5/ PPARβ/δ pathway by curcumin sensitizes retinoic acid resistant triple
  negative breast cancer cells to retinoic acid mediated growth suppression. \n\n\n\nCurcumin;
  Retinoic acid; Triple negative breast cancer; Fatty acid binding protein 5; Peroxisome
  proliferator-activated receptor β/δ\n\n\n\nAlthough breast cancer is the second
  most leading cause of death among women in the western world, early detection and
  new treatments have improved survival rates . However, no effective treatment for
  metastatic, triple negative breast cancer is available following surgery, radiation
  and chemotherapy for the primary tumor . This subtype of breast cancer accounts
  for 15-20% of all breast cancers and the signature of TNBCs is the lack of the estrogen
  receptor, progesterone receptor and the lack of the overexpression of HER2 . Drug
  resistance is a major problem in TNBC patients, promoting the need to understand
  the molecular mechanisms involved in the disease and identify future targeted therapy.
  Several promising agents are currently under clinical trials for the prevention
  of TNBC which include poly polymerase inhibitors, vitamin D and rexinoids . \n\nAnticancer
  drugs, derived from natural sources, have been used alone or in combination with
  traditional drugs to treat multiple diseases, including cancer . Curcumin derived
  from the plant Curcuma longa has been used as a dietary agent, food preservative
  and a longtime favorite Asian medicinal treatment . It is a hydrophobic polyphenol
  derived from turmeric that has anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties,
  promoting its potential for targeting various diseases, including cancer, arthritis,
  atherosclerosis, diabetes, and auto-immune diseases . Curcumin has exhibited inhibitory
  effects on several malignant cancers, including breast cancer . It has been used
  in clinical trials for colorectal cancer  and pancreatic cancer , and its use in
  combination with other therapeutic drugs promotes the suppression of tumor growth
  . Due to the low bioavailability and high metabolic instability of curcumin, development
  of analogs of curcumin and nanocurcumin to improve their chemotherapeutic efficacies
  are being investigated as next generation targeted therapy . Despite its current
  limitations, curcumin is highlighted for its efficacy in chemoprevention and reversing
  chemo-resistance in certain tumors . The ability of curcumin and its analogs to
  enhance the efficacy of existing chemotherapeutic agents will add value for its
  use in the treatment of highly aggressive chemo-resistant breast tumors. \n\nThe
  effect of curcumin is in part due to its ability to interfere with multiple signaling
  cascades such as cell cycle regulators, apoptotic proteins, pro-inflammatory cytokines,
  proliferative regulators and transcription factors such as nuclear factor-kappa
  B and Stat3 . It inhibits cancer cell and tumor growth, suppresses proliferation,
  and blocks angiogenesis and inflammation. Due to its pleiotropic effect, the role
  of curcumin to regulate various signaling pathways and genes have been reported
  in different cancer cell lines . \n\nThe use of retinoid therapy in cancer is promoted
  by the ability of retinoids to induce differentiation, cell cycle cycle arrest and
  apoptosis . Due to its favorable effect on the treatment of acute promyelocytic
  leukemia, retinoids are being tested in clinical trials in several tumor types .
  Vitamin A metabolite, retinoic acid transduces its signals by binding to specific
  nuclear hormone receptors termed retinoic acid receptors, which include RAR α, β,
  and γ . These receptors exist as predominately RAR/RXR heterodimers and to a lesser
  extent RXR/RXR homodimer . RARs bind to all-trans-RA or 9-cis-retinoic acid, whereas
  RXRs bind specifically to 9-cis-retinoic acid. The ligand-receptor complex acts
  as a transcription factor which binds to a specific DNA sequence element found on
  the promoter regions of target genes called retinoic acid response element . Transcriptional
  activation of RARs leads to differentiation and growth arrest , as well as apoptosis
  , establishing a prominent role of its use in anti-cancer therapy . Interestingly,
  RA has an alternative function and in some tissues RA promotes cell growth , and
  paradoxically facilitates tumor development. It has been well established that RA
  translates its pro-carcinogenic properties in a RAR-independent mechanism through
  activation of the nuclear receptor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor β/δ
  and its target genes . Studies have shown that fatty-acid binding protein 5 facilitates
  the transfer of ligands from the cytoplasm to PPARβ/δ, which enhances PPARβ/δ target
  genes that are directly involved in proliferative responses and cell survival, promoting
  cell growth and protection against apoptosis . PPARβ/δ has been implicated in the
  growth of other human cancers, including lung carcinoma, breast cancer and colon
  cancer . This nuclear receptor is well known to regulate the expression of angiogenic
  factor, vascular endothelial growth factor A, pro-survival signals of PDK1/Akt,
  and anti-apoptotic protein, 14-3-3epsilon . \n\nThe importance of FABP5 as a prognostic
  marker in breast cancer patients was studied in a cohort of breast tissues, pinpointing
  that elevated levels of FABP5 was correlated with tumor grade and poor prognosis
  . Not only are elevated levels of FABP5 a key determinant in the tumorigenic properties
  of mammary carcinoma , but also pancreatic cancer cell subtypes with elevated levels
  of FABP5 were associated with migration and invasion of cells, paralleling to lack
  of tumor growth inhibition . High FABP5 protein expression was evident in short
  term glioblastoma survivors with highly proliferating tumors compared to long term
  glioblastoma survivors . In light of the mounting evidence on the role of FABP5
  in cancer cell lines, FABP5 may serve as a novel prognostic marker and inhibiting
  FABP5 can serve as a potential combinatorial treatment to sensitize mammary carcinoma
  cells to retinoid therapy. \n\nIn this study, we report that curcumin blocks cell
  proliferation in RA-resistant TNBC cell lines by inhibiting FABP5. It sensitizes
  these cells to RA mediated growth suppression. The effect of curcumin in enhancing
  the inhibitory effects of RA in TNBC cells is the result of diminished expression
  of FABP5 and PPARβ/δ. Furthermore, we have identified a possible mechanism responsible
  for growth suppression by curcumin and RA. Understanding the mechanisms by which
  curcumin reverses the resistance of breast cancer to RA may provide alternate treatments
  for RA-resistant TNBC patients. \n\n\n\n\n\nAs previously described , antibodies
  against FABP5 were obtained from R &amp; D systems and β-tubulin was purchased from
  Sigma Aldrich Co. Antibodies for PPARβ/δ and p65 were obtained from Santa Cruz and
  Cell Signaling, respectively. Use of PPARβ/δ and p65 antibodies was referenced in
  , respectively. Antibody against β-actin was purchased from Cell Signaling. Anti-mouse
  and anti-rabbit immunoglobulin horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies were
  from BioRad, and anti-goat immunoglobulin was from Santa Cruz. Curcumin and all-trans-retinoic
  acid were obtained from Sigma. MTT reagent-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) was
  purchased from Sigma. \n\n\n\nMDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, SkBr3 and MCF-7 cells were
  maintained in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
  serum and antibiotics. MDA-MB-468 was purchased from American Type Culture Collection.
  \n\n\n\nA small amount of all-trans-RA was added to a 1 mL aliquot of 100% ethanol
  in the dark and rotated for 45 minutes at 4°C. The absorbance of RA was measured
  at 350 nm and the extinction coefficient of RA was used to calculate the concentration
  of RA. A Stock of 1 mM was prepared and used for treatment of cells. Curcumin was
  freshly prepared each time at a stock concentration of 50 mM in dimethyl sulfoxide
  and diluted at the appropriate concentration for treatment of cells. \n\n\n\nCells
  were cultured in 100 mm plates and treated with DMSO or curcumin for 24 hours. Cells
  were lysed in a buffer containing 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris, pH 7.2, 0.1% SDS, 1%
  Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, 5 mM EDTA, and 1 mM PMSF. Cells were lysed on ice
  for 1 hour and protein concentration was determined by the Bradford Assay. Cell
  lysate was resolved by SDS-PAGE and probed using the appropriate antibody. Anti-β-tubulin
  or anti-β-actin was used for loading control. \n\n\n\nCells were treated with curcumin
  and/or ATRA, and RNA was extracted using Trizol. As described in the high capacity
  RNA to cDNA kit from Applied Biosystems, 2 μg total RNA was reverse transcribed
  into cDNA. To determine expression of FABP5, PPARβ/δ and PDK1, and VEGF-A, qRT-PCR
  was carried out by using commercially available Taqman Chemistry and Assay on Demand
  Probes. GAPDH was used for normalization. Detection and data analysis were carried
  out on the ABI Step One Plus Real-Time PCR System. \n\n\n\nNF-κB p65 siRNA was purchased
  from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Briefly, 2 × 10 5 MDA-MB-231 cells were plated in
  6-well plates and transfected with 1 μg of p65 siRNA or control siRNA oligos using
  lipofectamine 2000 as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were incubated
  for 24 hours after which cells were harvested and analyzed for p65 and FABP5 expression
  using Western blot analysis. \n\n\n\nMDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells were seeded
  in a 96 well plate with Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium, 10% charcoal treated
  FBS and supplemented with antibiotics, and allowed to adhere overnight. Cells were
  then treated with 30 uM curcumin and/or 1 uM ATRA for 48 hours. Controls were treated
  with 0.1% DMSO, 0.1% ethanol and/or the combination of both. After 48 hours, 5 μg/ml
  MTT reagent-2, 5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) was added directly to the cells for
  3 hours, or until crystals formed. The media was carefully removed from the plate,
  leaving the cells intact and the cells were then resuspended in 150 μl of 0.04 M
  HCl in isopropanol. Absorbance was read at 570 nm to determine cell proliferation.
  \n\n\n\nCell Proliferation was also measured by the incorporation of BrdU in cells
  by using the BrdU cell proliferation kit from Cell Signaling. MDA-MB-231 cells were
  plated in 96-well plates and treated with 30 uM curcumin and/or 1 uM ATRA for 48
  hours. Controls were treated with 0.1% DMSO, 0.1% ethanol and/or the combination
  of both. Cells were then pulsed with BrdU overnight, fixed and followed by immunodetection
  of the incorporation of BrdU label. Absorbance was read at 450 nm to determine cell
  proliferation. \n\n\n\nStatistical significance of differences between treatments
  was determined using two tailed student t-test and p values were noted. Differences
  between groups were considered statistically significant at p ; 0.05. \n\n\n\n\n\nTo
  examine the effect of curcumin and ATRA on cell viability, MTT assay was performed
  in two RA-resistant TNBC cell lines. Mammary carcinoma cell, MDA-MB-231 is sensitive
  to curcumin  and resistant to ATRA . As shown in Figure 1A, curcumin suppresses
  mammary carcinoma cell growth of MDA-MB-231 cells in a dose dependent manner. By
  48 hours, 30 μM curcumin alone had produced a growth inhibitory effect of approximately
  40% in MDA-MB-231 cells. As illustrated in Figure 1B, the response to 30 μM of curcumin
  to suppress cell proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells is also time dependent. Thus,
  the proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells was inhibited by curcumin in a dose and time-dependent
  manner. To assess whether curcumin could sensitize these cells to RA-mediated growth
  suppression, we performed MTT assay in MDA-MB-231 cells treated with varying doses
  of curcumin in the presence or absence of 1 μM ATRA. As expected, MDA-MB-231 cells
  treated only with ATRA were resistant to cell growth suppression while 10 μM or
  20 μM curcumin suppressed growth, although not statistically significant. The combination
  of ATRA with 10 μM or 20 μM of curcumin did not effect cell growth. In fact, cell
  growth of MDA-MB-231 cells treated with curcumin and ATRA was similar to ATRA-treated
  cells, suggesting that the proliferative function of RA suppresses the anti-proliferative
  effects of curcumin. As expected, 30 μM curcumin suppressed mammary carcinoma cell
  growth by 40% and interestingly, MDA-MB-231 cells treated with a combination of
  30 μM curcumin and 1 μM ATRA further reduced cell growth to approximately 60%, sensitizing
  TNBC MDA-MB-231 cells to the inhibitory effects of RA. At a maximal dose of 30 μM
  curcumin, this agent was able to sensitize MDA-MB-231 cells to RA.To test whether
  sensitivity to ATRA can be attained by treatment of another RA-resistant breast
  cancer cells with curcumin, we performed cell proliferation assay in TNBC MDA-MB-468
  cells. The growth inhibitory effect of curcumin was observed in MDA-MB-468 cells
  and 30 μM curcumin suppressed the proliferation of these cells in a time dependent
  manner. Similar to the inhibitory effects of 30 μM curcumin and 1 μM ATRA in MDA-MB-231
  cells, we also observed similar results in MDA-MB-468. Curcumin reduced growth of
  MDA-MB-468, while no such inhibition was observed in the presence of ATRA. However,
  the combination of both 1 μM ATRA and 30 μM curcumin reduced growth of MDA-MB-468
  when compared to either treatment alone. Thus, curcumin sensitizes RA-resistant
  TNBC cells to the growth suppressive effects of RA. \n\nFigure 1. Curcumin sensitizes
  MDA-MB-231 cells to RA-mediated growth suppression. MDA-MD-231 cells were treated

  for each of the treatment was calculated relative to their solvent, DMSO, ethanol
  or DMSO and ethanol, respectively. The controls were set at 100%. Data are mean

  # # p = 0.008. MDA-MD-468 cells were plated in 96 well plates, treated with 30 μM
  curcumin for varying time. The control was DMSO treated according to the timeframe
  of the cells treated with curcumin. The % cell proliferation for each of the treatment
  with curcumin for the designated time was calculated with respect to the treatment
  with DMSO for the corresponding time. Data are mean of ± SE.  p = 0.009 versus control,

  control was DMSO, ethanol or a combination of both. The % cell proliferation for
  each of the treatment was calculated relative to their solvent, DMSO, ethanol or
  DMSO and ethanol, respectively. The controls were set at 100%. Data are mean of
  ± SE.  p = 0.03 versus curcumin. \n\n\n\nSensitivity to RA is dependent on the expression
  level of FABP5 in mammary carcinoma cells . We examined the expression level of
  FABP5 in RA-resistant TNBC cell lines in comparison to mammary carcinoma cells sensitive
  to RA-mediated growth suppression. High mRNA expression level of FABP5 was evident
  in the highly aggressive, RA-resistant TNBC cell lines, MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468,
  which are both ER- and HER2- in comparison to MCF-7 and SkBr3. Similarly, there
  is high FABP5 protein expression in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cell lines compared
  to MCF-7 and SkBr3 cells. Although SkBr3 mammary carcinoma cells are aggressive
  and HER2+, these cells are sensitive to retinoic acid , as is MCF-7 cells. It has
  been well established that FABP5 suppresses sensitivity of cancer cells to retinoic
  acid , and the fact that there is low expression level of FABP5 in SkBr3 suggests
  sensitivity of these cells to retinoic acid. Thus, a direct relationship exists
  between the high expression level of FABP5 and the lack of sensitivity to retinoic
  acid, and not the aggressiveness of the cancer. \n\nFigure 3. Expression levels

  of PPARβ/δ was analyzed by qRT-PCR. GAPDH was used for normalization. Data are mean
  of ± SE p = 0.03 versus control treatment. \n\nThe mRNA and protein expression of
  the nuclear receptor, PPARβ/δ which binds to ligands delivered by FABP5 was also
  examined in the various breast cancer cell lines. High mRNA and protein expression
  level of PPARβ/δ was evident in the RA-resistant mammary carcinoma cells, MDA-MB-231
  and MDA-MB-468 when compared to MCF-7 cells. However, the highly aggressive SkBr3
  had low levels of PPARβ/δ mRNA expression and undetectable levels of PPARβ/δ protein
  expression. This suggests there is no correlation between the level of PPARβ/δ and
  the aggressiveness of the breast cancer cells, but instead an association between
  RA-resistance and high expression of PPARβ/δ.As shown in Figure 1d, 30 μM of curcumin
  suppressed RA- resistant MDA-MB-231 cells, while the combination with 1 μM RA sensitized
  these cells to respond to retinoic acid-mediated growth suppression. To determine
  whether the enhanced growth-inhibitory effects of curcumin and RA on mammary carcinoma
  cells were likely due to associated changes of FABP5 expression, we sought to assess
  the effect of curcumin on FABP5 expression in MDA-MB-231 cells. To investigate whether
  curcumin regulates the expression level of FABP5, MDA-MB-231 cells were treated
  with varying concentrations of curcumin for 24 hours, and the levels of FABP5 protein
  were determined by Western blot analysis. Protein levels of FABP5 were reduced dose-dependently
  in MDA-MB-231 cells after treatment with curcumin. A significant decrease in FABP5
  protein expression was evident at 30 μM curcumin. The levels of FABP5 at mRNA level
  were also analyzed by qRT-PCR. To analyze the mRNA expression level of FABP5, MDA-MB-231
  cells were treated with 30 μM curcumin, mRNA isolated and consistent with reduced
  protein expression, 30 μM curcumin suppressed mRNA expression levels of FABP5 by
  approximately 30%. At 30 μM curcumin, FABP5 expression was reduced in MDA-MB-231
  cells, and at the same dose, curcumin sensitized them to RA-mediated growth suppression.

  were resolved with SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with antibodies recognizing p65 or

  with control and p65 siRNA for 24 hours, protein extracted and expression level

  for normalization. Data are mean of ± SE. +, p = 0.016 versus control, ++, p = 0.03
  versus curcumin. \n\nIt is known that FABP5 delivers ligands, such as RA, to the
  nuclear receptor PPARβ/δ , known to target genes involved in cell survival and proliferation.
  Since curcumin downregulates the expression of FABP5, we investigated the effect
  of curcumin on PPARβ/δ. MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with varying doses of curcumin
  and at 30 μM of curcumin, a statistically significant decrease in PPARβ/δ protein
  expression level was observed, concomitant to the decrease of FABP5 expression by
  curcumin. Suppression of PPARβ/δ protein expression by curcumin was dose-dependent.
  Since 30 μM curcumin inhibited PPARβ/δ protein expression, we also examined PPARβ/δ
  mRNA expression at this concentration. Our data shows that 30 μM of curcumin reduced
  PPARβ/δ mRNA in these cells. Because curcumin affects the expression level of FABP5
  and PPARβ/δ in RA-resistant MDA-MB-231 mammary carcinoma cells, we further examined
  the effect of curcumin on these genes in RA-resistant MDA-MB-468 cells. Curcumin
  reduced FABP5 protein expression in MDA-MB-468 cells in a dose dependent manner,
  with a statistically significant reduction at 30 μM of curcumin. Consistently, FABP5
  mRNA expression was also reduced by 30 μM of curcumin. To examine the effect of
  curcumin on PPARβ/δ expression, we performed immunoblotting and qRT-PCR to determine
  the protein and mRNA expression of PPARβ/δ, respectively. Curcumin suppressed PPARβ/δ
  protein expression in a dose-dependent manner, with a statistically significant
  effect at 30 μM of curcumin treatment. Comparable results at the mRNA level of PPARβ/δ
  was also observed, wherein curcumin suppressed PPARβ/δ mRNA expression levels in
  MDA-MB-468 cells. \n\n\n\nOne of the established biological effects of curcumin
  to its chemopreventive activity is the inhibition of the NF-κB pathway . Constitutive
  NF-κB activity is associated with enhanced proliferation and survival of malignant
  cells . We sought to investigate whether the effect of curcumin on the expression
  level of FABP5 depends on NF-κB, in particular since it has been described that
  this transcription factor regulates FABP5 through the two putative NF-κB response
  elements on the FABP5 promoter . We assessed whether suppression of NF-κB by curcumin
  regulates the expression level of FABP5 in MDA-MB-231 cells. Equal amounts of cell
  lysates from control and 30 μM curcumin-treated MDA-MB-231 cells were probed for
  the NF-κB subunit, p65 using western blot analysis. As reported previously  and
  as shown in Figure 6a, 30 μM curcumin decreased p65 protein expression in MDA-MB-231
  cells. To directly test the role of NF-κB to regulate FABP5 in MDA-MB-231 cells,
  we used pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, a chemical inhibitor on the activation of NF-κB,
  to decrease p65 expression  and examined the effect of FABP5 protein expression.
  Treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with 25 μM PDTC suppressed p65 expression level at
  a modest level. Concomitantly, we examined the protein expression level of FABP5
  in MDA-MB-231 cells treated with PDTC and observed that suppression of the p65 subunit
  of NF-κB reduced FABP5 expression in MDA-MB-231 cells. In addition, p65 was silenced
  in MDA-MB-231 cells and we examined the protein expression of FABP5. Knock-down
  of p65 suppressed FABP5 expression in these cells. These results support our hypothesis
  that treatment with curcumin blocks the expression of NF-κB regulated FABP5 gene
  expression, and that NF-κB is a regulator in the molecular mechanism of curcumin
  mediated suppression of FABP5. \n\n\n\nWe assessed the population of cells using
  BrdU incorporation assay upon treatment with curcumin and/or ATRA in MDA-MB-231
  cells. Mammary carcinoma cells were treated with either curcumin, ATRA or the combination
  of both agents for 48 hours and labeled with 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine overnight prior
  to analysis. As expected, treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with ATRA did not reduce
  cell proliferation. However, MDA-MB-231-treated with curcumin showed a reduction
  in the population of cells, noted by the reduction in BrdU incorporation, and the
  effect was pronounced when combined with ATRA. Hence, curcumin and RA together suppress
  cell proliferation, supporting the results of the MTT assay. \n\nActivation of PPARβ/δ
  induces the transcriptional activity of several downstream genes in mammary carcinoma
  cells such as the survival factor PDK1/Akt, VEGF-A and 14-3-3-epsilon . We examined
  the effect of curcumin and/or ATRA on the mRNA expression level of PDK1 in MDA-MB-231.
  As shown in Figure 7b, a 4-hour treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with 1 μM of ATRA
  enhanced the mRNA level of the survival factor, PDK1. Although RA enhanced survival
  factor, PDK1 mRNA expression within 4 hours, enhanced cell proliferation was not
  observed after 48 hours of treatment with RA and growth of the cells remained as
  that of the control cells. The conventional growth inhibitory properties of RA in
  some cells  was not observed in triple negative breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231
  but as noted previously  and as seen in Figures 1d and 7a, MDA-MB-231 cells are
  retinoic acid resistant. However in some carcinomas, RA enhances hyperproliferation
  . To determine whether there is delayed response to hyperproliferation and PDK1
  expression, MDA-MB-231were treated with 1 μM ATRA for 2–8 days. At approximately
  6 days, RA promoted hyperproliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells. The timeframe at which
  PDK1 is induced does not correlate with the time at which MDA-MB-231 cells responds
  to RA with hyperproliferation, but these results demonstrate that these cells are
  resistant to the growth inhibitory effects of RA and thus RA-resistant. While ATRA
  enhanced PDK1 expression, a small reduction in mRNA levels was observed when cells
  were treated with curcumin, though the effect was not statistically significant.
  PPARβ/δ ligands have been shown to activate PDK1 expression in several cells  but
  other reports suggest that PDK1 is not a direct target of PPARβ/δ . In our study,
  we observed that despite the downregulation of PPARβ/δ by curcumin in MDA-MB-231
  cells, curcumin does not suppress PDK1, suggesting that PDK1 is not regulated by
  PPARβ/δ in these cells. However, the combination of curcumin and ATRA further reduced
  PDK1 at the mRNA level, compared to curcumin alone. Although PDK1 may not be a PPARβ/δ
  target gene in these cells, we can conclude that RA regulates PDK1 mRNA expression
  by an alternative mechanism in these cells. Curcumin may regulate this mechanism
  and suppress the upregulation of PDK1 mRNA expression by RA. \n\nDue to the controversy
  that remains on whether PDK1 is a direct target of PPARβ/δ, we also examined the
  effect of curcumin and RA on another PPARβ/δ target gene, VEGF-A . As shown in Figure
  7d, ATRA induced VEGF-A mRNA expression, while curcumin suppressed VEGF-A. In addition,
  the combination of curcumin and RA further suppressed VEGF-A expression. Curcumin-mediated
  suppression of PPARβ/δ in MDA-MB-231 cells, when compared to control, reduces the
  downstream target gene, VEGF-A by approximately 40%, while curcumin suppressed RA-mediated
  transcriptional activity of PPARβ/δ target gene, VEGF-A by an additional 30%. This
  suggests that the proliferative effect of RA in these cells is diminished in the
  combination with curcumin, owing to the fact that curcumin suppresses the FABP5/PPARβ/δ
  pathway, and MDA-MB-231 cells are sensitized to the growth inhibitory effects of
  RA. \n\n\n\nIn this study, we show that curcumin sensitizes RA-resistant TNBC cells
  to RA-mediated growth suppression by modulating the expression level of the FABP5/PPARβ/δ
  pathway. The high expression level of FABP5 in the aggressive RA-resistant TNBC
  cells, MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468, correlates with the marked upregulation of FABP5
  observed in human breast tumors, particularly in tumors categorized by its invasive
  properties as well as late stages of breast cancer . Our observation shows that
  curcumin downregulates FABP5 expression, and concomitantly suppresses its cognate
  receptor, PPARβ/δ. Adding to the network of genes regulated by curcumin , we demonstrate
  that curcumin regulates the pro-proliferative gene, FABP5 and the nuclear receptor,
  PPARβ/δ. \n\nSeveral PPARβ/δ target genes, such as PDK1 and VEGF-A are involved
  in proliferation and angiogenesis, respectively . In mammary carcinoma cells expressing
  high levels of FABP5, FABP5 delivers RA to PPARβ/δ, enhances the transcriptional
  activity of PPARβ/δ and activates PPARβ/δ target gene, PDK1 and VEGF-A . Based on
  previous reports that RA regulates PDK1 through PPARβ/δ, we also examined the regulation
  of PDK1 by RA in MDA-MB-231 cells. From our data, we conclude that RA regulates
  PDK1, however regulation of PDK1 by RA is not via PPARβ/δ in these cells. Several
  studies have also demonstrated that PDK1 is not a PPARβ/δ target gene . Comparing
  the suppression of PDK1 by curcumin and/or ATRA suggests that curcumin alone reduces
  PDK1 expression, while the combination of the agents further suppress PDK1 mRNA
  expression. RA may be regulating PDK1, at the mRNA level, by an alternative mechanism.
  Hence, curcumin may regulate this mechanism and thereby suppress RA-mediated upregulation
  of PDK1 mRNA. Further studies will be required to dissect the pathway by which RA
  regulates PDK1 in these cells. Examining the effect of curcumin and ATRA on another
  PPARβ/δ target gene, VEGF-A, we discovered that RA enhances VEGF-A, while curcumin
  significantly decreases VEGF-A mRNA expression. Suppression of FABP5 by curcumin
  reduces the delivery of RA to PPARβ/δ, resulting in diminished transcriptional activation
  of PPARβ/δ by ATRA. Curcumin suppresses VEGF-A expression by approximately 45%,
  however in the combination of ATRA, mRNA expression of VEGF-A is reduced to an additional
  30%. Thus, downregulation of FABP5 by curcumin reduces delivery of ATRA to PPARβ/δ,
  hence reducing RA-mediated transcriptional activation of PPARβ/δ target gene, VEGF-A.
  \n\nCurcumin regulates multiple transcription factors, including NF-κB. TNBC cells
  constitutively express NF-κB, a transcription factor that regulates genes known
  to be involved in proliferation, metastasis and angiogenesis . Having shown previously
  that NF-κB regulates FABP5 , we demonstrate that the mechanism by which curcumin
  regulates FABP5 gene expression is mediated through the suppression of NF-κB. Hence,
  FABP5 is regulated by NF-κB in mammary carcinoma MDA-MB-231 cells and curcumin downregulates
  FABP5 expression by suppressing the p65 subunit of NF-κB. \n\nLimited therapeutic
  options and poor prognosis of TNBC patients after the treatment with standard conventional
  drugs creates an emerging need to understand the molecular basis of this disease,
  as well as to identify alternative chemotherapeutic targets and treatments. A correlation
  with RA resistance in breast cancer tumors has been attributed to the high expression
  level of FABP5  which has been associated with poor prognosis in cancer . The fact
  that TNBC cell lines, MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468, express high levels of FABP5 and
  are resistant to retinoid therapy suggests that by suppressing the expression level
  of FABP5, these subtypes of breast cancer cells can overcome RA resistance. Interestingly,
  our data show that downregulation of the FABP5/PPARβ/δ pathway by curcumin restores
  the sensitivity of RA-resistant TNBC cells to the inhibitory effects of RA and suppresses
  cell growth in the combination of curcumin and ATRA. Although a dose of 30 μM curcumin
  is required to reduce cell growth of MDA-MB-231 cells, it is at this dose that curcumin
  suppresses the FABP5/PPARβ/δ pathway. Hence, combining ATRA with 30 μM curcumin
  reduces proliferation an additional 20% and chemosensitizes TNBCs to retinoid therapy.
  A marginal decrease in cell proliferation by the combination of curcumin and retinoic
  acid is consistent with the modest suppression of the FABP5/PPARβ/δ pathway. As
  shown in a previous study, that despite a modest reduction in breast cancer cell
  proliferation, the combination of metformin and hyperthermia translated to a significant
  reduction in colony sphere formation . Similarly, synthetic analogues of curcumin,
  CDF reversed the resistance of pancreatic cells to gemcitabine . Although a 10-20%
  reduction in cell proliferation was observed in the combination of the two drugs
  in comparison to CDF alone, the growth inhibitory effects of the combined drugs
  resulted in significant reduction in colony formation. Despite the modest reduction
  in our study on mammary carcinoma cell growth with the combination of curcumin and
  ATRA, this study may translate to a more significant effect in vivo. Future studies
  will explore the effect of curcumin and retinoic acid on the transformational properties
  of cancer cells to provide information for its use in in vivo studies. \n\nBreast
  cancer cells respond to curcumin at 1–50 μM range with the strongest effect between
  20–30 μM  . Consistent with our data, several reports have documented that 30 μM
  curcumin suppresses MDA-MB-231 mammary carcinoma cell growth within the time frame
  of 48 hours by approximately 40-50% . Curcumin has also been studied in several
  cancer models such as colorectal carcinoma, non small cell lung cancer and pancreatic
  cancer, and depending on the cancer model, the IC50 of curcumin has not only varied
  among the different cancers, but also between subtypes within a cancer model . One
  of the criteria that determines the degree to which curcumin can suppress cell proliferation
  is dependent on the uptake of curcumin within the cells. For instance, MDA-MB-231
  cells were more sensitive to the anti-proliferative activity of 25–50 μM curcumin
  compared to MCF-7 cells . The cellular uptake of curcuminoids in breast cancer cells
  correlated with the inhibitory activity of this compound which is a determinant
  of the IC50 of curcuminoids in the cancer subtype . Despite the differences in the
  IC50 among cancer cells, one of the advantages of curcumin is its preferential uptake
  by tumor cells compared to normal cells . Among the strategies used to improve the
  efficacy of curcumin and potentiate the growth-inhibitory activity of this agent,
  and more importantly reversing chemoresistance in cancer models, has been aimed
  at designing and synthesizing novel structural analogues of curcumin . One such
  compound is demethoxycurcumin which has the potential of suppressing a wide range
  of mammary carcinoma cell lines with the most efficient inhibitory activity on TNBC
  . Analogues of curcumin, such as HO-3867 are taken up by multiple drug resistant
  or sensitive cancer cell lines at considerably lower doses than curcumin , while
  synthetic analogues, G0-Y030, FLLL-11 and FLLL-12 promotes anti-proliferation in
  colorectal cancer cells at lower IC50 than curcumin . The safety and tolerance of
  curcumin has been demonstrated in several clinical trials , however the disadvantage
  of curcumin is its poor absorption properties . One such study has shown the improvement
  in the reduction of cell growth and colony formation of colon cancer stem cells
  upon treatment with curcumin analog, CDF with 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin compared
  to 5-FU and oxaliplatin with free curcumin . To prevent the emergence on the chemoresistance
  of cancer cells to conventional chemotherapeutic agents, several studies have employed
  the use of curcumin to sensitize cancer cells to chemotherapeutic drugs, such as
  doxorubicin . By improving the absorption of curcumin and cellular uptake of curcumin,
  curcumin derivatives may be more potent in suppressing the FABP5/PPARβ/δ pathway,
  and enhance the efficacy of RA by reducing the dosage to be used in vivo, in order
  to better tolerate its use in cancer patients. \n\nMounting evidence has demonstrated
  that the expression level of FABP5 is low in low grade tumors and highly upregulated
  as the progression of the disease manifests to aggressive, metastatic tumors , clarifying
  the importance of a rational drug design targeting FABP5. Identifying potential
  drug targets against FABP5 will establish the sensitivity of cancer cells to RA
  and may prove to be a rationale to improve the clinical outcome of RA use in breast
  cancer patients. Our studies demonstrate that curcumin can be used to overcome RA
  resistance in mammary carcinoma cells since curcumin suppresses FABP5 expression
  level, reducing the delivery of RA to PPARβ/δ and downregulating the expression
  of PPARβ/δ target gene. To overcome the challenges of using free curcumin, novel
  structural analogs of curcumin have been synthesized to improve the chemotherapeutic
  effects . In addition, curcumin encapsulated in liposomes or production of curcumin
  nanoparticles has been formulated to enhance the selective delivery of these drugs
  . Using various derivatives of curcumin would improve bioavailability which may
  improve treatment of breast cancer with RA. \n\nTaken together, we have shown that
  curcumin in combination with RA sensitizes RA-resistant TNBC cells by suppressing
  FABP5/PPARβ/δ pathway, and promotes the growth inhibitory effect of RA. Knowing
  that the acquired resistance to RA in TNBC cells is manifested by the increased
  expression of FABP5, future studies will entail the development of inhibitors against
  FABP5. Moreover, we provide evidence that curcumin can inhibit FABP5 and the use
  of curcumin or its analogs may serve as potential therapeutic agents to overcome
  RA resistance in RA-resistant breast cancer cells. \n\n\n\nThe results of this study
  showed that curcumin sensitizes RA-resistant TNBC cells to RA-mediated growth suppression.
  By suppressing the expression level of FABP5 and its cognate receptor, PPARβ/δ,
  curcumin suppresses the downstream target gene of PPARβ/δ, VEGF-A. The inhibitory
  effects of curcumin on the FABP5/PPARβ/δ pathway reduce RA-induced VEGF-A expression.
  The mechanism by which curcumin regulates FABP5 is by downregulating the transcription
  factor, NF-κB. Further investigation using analogs of curcumin or liposome based
  curcumin should be employed to evaluate the use of this drug to further enhance
  efficacy of RA and promote RA sensitivity in RA-resistant breast cancers. \n\n\n\nFABP5:
