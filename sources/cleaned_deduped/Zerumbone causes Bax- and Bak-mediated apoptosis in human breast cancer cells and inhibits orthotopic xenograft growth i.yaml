  The present study was undertaken to determine the anticancer efficacy of zerumbone,
  a sesquiterpene from subtropical ginger, against human breast cancer cells in vitro
  and in vivo. ZER treatment caused a dose-dependent decrease in viability of MCF-7
  and MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells in association with G2/M phase cell cycle
  arrest and apoptosis induction. ZER-mediated cell cycle arrest was associated with
  downregulation of cyclin B1, cyclin-dependent kinase 1, Cdc25C, and Cdc25B. Even
  though ZER treatment caused stabilization of p53 and induction of PUMA, these proteins
  were dispensable for ZER-induced cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis. Exposure of
  MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells to ZER resulted in downregulation of Bcl-2 but its ectopic
  expression failed to confer protection against ZER-induced apoptosis. On the other
  hand, the SV40 immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts derived from Bax and Bak
  double knockout mice were significantly more resistant to ZER-induced apoptosis.
  ZER-treated MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells exhibited a robust activation of both Bax
  and Bak. In vivo growth of orthotopic MDA-MB-231 xenografts was significantly retarded
  by ZER administration in association with apoptosis induction and suppression of
  cell proliferation. These results indicate that ZER causes G2/M phase cell cycle
  arrest and Bax/Bak-mediated apoptosis in human breast cancer cells, and retards
  growth of MDA-MB-231 xenografts in vivo.





























  Breast cancer is a major health problem for women worldwide  necessitating identification
  of novel anticancer strategies. Merit of this objective is further enforced as many
  of the known risk factors associated with breast cancer are not easily modifiable
  . Dietary compounds owing to their safety have drawn considerable attention in recent
  years for the discovery of novel cancer preventive and therapeutic agents . Bioactive
  compounds with preventive efficacy against cancer in preclinical rodent models have
  now been identified from many edible vegetables, including cruciferous vegetables
  and garlic . Moreover, population-based case–control studies continue to support
  the notion that dietary intake of certain fruits and vegetables may reduce the risk
  of cancer .


  Zerumbone, a monocyclic sesquiterpene derived from tropical ginger Zingiber zerumbet,
  is one such phytochemical with preventive efficacy in preclinical rodent models
  of cancer and pancreatitis . For example, dietary administration of ZER for 5 weeks
  caused reduction in the frequency of aberrant crypt foci in association with suppression
  of cyclooxygenase-2 . Oral feeding of ZER inhibited dextran sodium sulfate-induced
  colitis in female ICR mice . ZER treatment was also reported to suppress skin tumor
  initiation and promotion in ICR mice . ZER administration caused regression of cervical
  intraepithelial neoplasia in female Balb/c mice prenatally exposed to diethylstilboestrol
  . Diethylnitrosamine-initiated and 2-acetylaminofluorene-promoted liver carcinogenesis
  was inhibited by treatment with ZER .


  Cell culture models have also been used to study anticancer effects of ZER . For
  example, ZER inhibited proliferation of human colonic adenocarcinoma cell lines
  in association with dysfunction of mitochondria transmembrane leading to apoptotic
  cell death . Cytotoxic effect of ZER on leukemia cells was found to be mediated
  through cell cycle arrest and Fas- and mitochondria-mediated apoptosis . In liver
  cancer HepG2 cells, ZER-induced apoptosis was shown to be independent of p53 but
  associated with modulation of Bax/Bcl-2 ratio . Despite these advances, however,
  the mechanisms underlying growth inhibitory and proapoptotic effect of ZER are not
  fully understood. In the present study, we have addressed this mechanistic gap using
  MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 human breast cancer cells as a model.






  ZER was either purified as described previously  or purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
  Reagents including 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole and propidium iodide were from
  Sigma-Aldrich, whereas cell culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen-Life
  Technologies. Sources of antibodies were as follows: antibodies against Cdc25C,
  cleaved poly-(ADP-ribose)-polymerase, and p53 were from Cell Signaling Technology;
  anti-cyclin B1, anti-cyclin-dependent kinase 1, anti-Bak, anti-Bax, and anti-p53
  upregulated mediator of apoptosis antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology;
  antibodies against Cdc25B and active Bax were purchased from BD Biosciences; anti-Bcl-2
  antibody was from Dako-Agilent Technologies; an antibody specific for detection
  of active Bak was from Calbiochem; and anti-actin antibody was from Sigma-Aldrich.
  MitoTracker Green and Alexa Fluor 568–conjugated goat anti-mouse antibodies were
  from Invitrogen-Life Technologies. Annexin V-FITC/PI Apoptosis Detection kit was
  purchased from BD Biosciences. The p53-targeted small interfering RNA was purchased
  from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, whereas a control nonspecific siRNA was purchased
  from Qiagen.




  MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, and MCF-10A cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection
  and maintained, as described by us previously . Wild-type HCT-116 cell line and
  its isogenic PUMA knockout variant were generously provided by Dr. Bert Vogelstein
  and cultured in McCoy’s 5A modified medium supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum
  and antibiotics. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts derived from wild-type and Bax and
  Bak double knockout mice and immortalized by transfection with a plasmid containing
  SV40 genomic DNA were generously provided by the late Dr. Stanley J. Korsmeyer and
  maintained, as described previously . Stock solution of ZER was prepared in dimethyl
  sulfoxide, and diluted with complete media before use. An equal volume of DMSO was
  added to controls. Effect of ZER treatment on cell survival was determined by trypan
  blue dye exclusion assay, as described by us previously  or cell proliferation assay
  using a Cell Proliferation Assay kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
  Effect of ZER treatment on cell cycle distribution was determined by flow cytometry
  after staining the cells with PI, as described by us previously .




  Control and ZER-treated cells were processed for immunoblotting, as described by
  us previously . Densitometric quantitation was done using UN-SCAN-IT software version
  5.1.




  Apoptosis induction was assessed by quantitation of histone-associated DNA fragment
  release into the cytosol using an ELISA kit from Roche Applied Sciences or flow
  cytometry using Annexin V-FITC/PI Apoptosis Detection kit.




  MCF-7 cells were seeded in six-well plates and transfected at ~50 % confluency with
  100 nM of p53-targeted siRNA or control siRNA using oligofectamine. Twenty-four
  hours after transfection, the cells were treated with DMSO or ZER for 24 h. Cells
  were collected and processed for western blotting and determination of cell cycle
  distribution.




  MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells were transiently transfected at ~50–60 % confluency with
  the empty pSFFV-neo vector or pSFFV vector encoding for Bcl-2 using FuGENE6 transfection
  reagent. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were treated with DMSO
  or ZER and processed for immunoblotting and measurement of apoptosis and cell viability.




  Effect of ZER on mitochondrial membrane potential was measured using potential-sensitive
  dye JC-1 according to the manufacturer’s instructions .




  MDA-MB-231 or MCF-7 cells were cultured on coverslips, allowed to attach, and then
  exposed to DMSO or 20 μM ZER for 8 h. Immunocytochemical analysis for active Bak
  and active Bax was performed as described by us previously . The cells were examined
  under a Leica DC300F microscope at 100× magnification.




  Female severe combined immunodeficient mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories
  and acclimated for 1 week prior to the start of the experiment. Following 1 week
  feeding of irradiated AIN-76A diet, exponentially growing MDA-MB231-luc-D3H1 cells
  were suspended in media and mixed in a 1:1 ratio with Matrigel. A 0.03 mL suspension
  containing 2.5 × 106 cells was injected orthotopically in both inguinal mammary
  fat pads. On the same day, the mice began intraperitoneal administration of either
  PBS or ZER five times/week. At the onset of the study, there were 10 mice in each
  group. Number of effective mice at the conclusion of the study was n = 6 for the
  control group and 0.18 mg ZER/mouse groups and n = 7 for the 0.35 mg ZER/mouse group
  because of premature deaths unrelated to treatment and/or failure of tumor take.
  In the 0.35 mg ZER/mouse group, tumor grew only on one flank in two mice. Body weights
  of the mice were recorded weekly.




  A portion of the tumor tissue was fixed in 10 % neutral-buffered formalin, dehydrated,
  embedded in paraffin, and sectioned at 4–5 μm thickness. TUNEL staining and immunohistochemical
  analysis for Ki-67 expression was performed as described by us previously .






  Structure of ZER is shown in Fig. 1a. Viability of MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells was
  decreased significantly upon treatment with ZER in a concentration- and time-dependent
  manner as evidenced by trypan blue dye exclusion assay and cell proliferation assay.
  For example, the IC50 for ZER in MDA-MB-231 cells after 24 and 48 h exposure was
  9.9 ± 4.9 μM and 4.2 ± 1.2 μM, respectively. The IC50 for ZER in MCF-7 cells after
  24 and 48 h treatment was 10.1 ± 5.3 and 2.9 ± 0.8 μM, respectively. Exposure of
  MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells to ZER resulted in an increase in sub-diploid and G2/M
  fraction that was accompanied by a reduction in G0G1 phase and S phase cells compared
  with DMSO-treated control. The G2/M phase cell cycle arrest resulting from ZER treatment
  was maintained when the cells were cultured for an additional 24 h in the absence
  of the drug. The ZER-induced G2/M phase cell cycle arrest was associated with a
  marked decrease in protein levels of cyclin B1, Cdk1, Cdc25C, and Cdc25B in both
  MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells.

  and Annexin V-FITC-positive and PI-positive fraction in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cultures
  treated for 48 h with DMSO or ZER. Fraction of apoptotic cells was increased markedly
  upon treatment with ZER. Consistent with these results, the ZER-treated MDA-MB-231
  and MCF-7 cells exhibited a dose-dependent and statistically significant increase
  in histone-associated DNA fragment release into the cytosol compared with corresponding
  DMSO-treated controls. Finally, apoptosis induction by ZER in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7
  cells was confirmed by immunoblotting for cleaved PARP. In contrast to MDA-MB-231
  and MCF-7 cells, ZER treatment failed to induce histone-associated DNA fragment
  release into the cytosol in MCF-10A cells. Collectively, these results indicated
  that breast cancer cells were more sensitive to ZER-mediated apoptosis compared
  with normal cells.

  PUMA is a BH3-only member of the Bcl-2 family of proapoptotic proteins that facilitates
  apoptosis by different stimuli . There was a marked increase in the levels of PUMA
  protein after treatment with ZER in both MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells. Because PUMA
  is a p53-regulated protein, these results indicated that PUMA induction resulting
  from ZER treatment involved p53-independent mechanism(s). However, PUMA was dispensable
  for ZER-mediated apoptosis induction as well as inhibition of cell proliferation
  as evidenced by analysis in wild-type and PUMA KO variants of HCT-116 cells. Likewise,
  even though ZER treatment resulted in stabilization of p53 protein in MCF-7 cells,
  the ZER-induced enrichment of sub-diploid apoptotic fraction as well as G2/M fraction
  was sustained even after knockdown of the p53 protein by 60 %. Based on these observations,
  we conclude that both p53 and PUMA proteins are dispensable for cellular responses
  to ZER.

  Because ZER was previously shown to modulate levels of Bcl-2 protein in liver cancer
  cells , we determined its role in breast cancer cell apoptosis by ZER. As can be
  seen in Fig. 4a, ZER treatment resulted in a decrease in protein levels of Bcl-2
  in both MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells. Transient transfection of MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7
  cells with Bcl-2 plasmid resulted in 25- and 2.2-fold increase in its protein level,
  respectively, compared with corresponding empty vector-transfected control cells.
  However, ectopic expression of Bcl-2 failed to abolish ZER-mediated cleavage of
  PARP, histone-associated DNA fragment release into the cytosol or inhibition of
  cell survival. Even though % survival upon treatment with ZER in vector-transfected
  control MDA-MB-231 cells appeared different from that in Bcl-2 overexpressing cells,
  the difference was not significant in any of the 3 independent experiments.

  and b between empty vector-transfected and Bcl-2 overexpressing cells by one-way

  We next studied potential involvement of multidomain proapoptotic proteins Bax and
  Bak in ZER-induced apoptosis. The protein levels of Bax and Bak were only modestly
  increased upon treatment of MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells with ZER. Many apoptogenic
  signals promote conformational change of Bax and Bak which in turn causes their
  oligomerization to induce pores in the outer membrane resulting in a loss of the
  mitochondrial membrane potential followed by cell death . As shown in Fig. 5b, ZER
  treatment caused collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential as evidenced by accumulation
  of monomeric JC-1. We performed immunocytochemistry to determine activation of Bax
  and Bak in cells treated with 20 μM of ZER using antibodies specific for detection
  of active Bax and active Bak. The ZER treatment caused activation of Bax and Bak
  in both MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells as evidenced by merging of the Bax- or Bak-associated
  red fluorescence and MitoTracker Green-associated fluorescence leading to appearance
  of yellow-orange color, which was rare in DMSO-treated control cells. The ZER-treated
  MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells also showed change in the appearance of mitochondrial
  network, as mitochondria that normally have an elongated structure acquired a rounded
  shape with closely packed stacks.

  indicated by green and red colors, respectively. b Representative flow histograms

  SV40 immortalized MEFs derived from wild-type mice and Bak-Bax double knockout mice.
  The MEF were treated for 24 or 48 h with DMSO or the indicated concentrations of
  ZER and processed for flow cytometry. Quantitation relative to DMSO-treated WT MEF
  is shown. Results shown are mean ± SD. Significantly different compared with a respective
  DMSO-treated control and b between WT and DKO by one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni’s
  multiple comparison test. Each experiment was done at least twice and representative
  data from one such experiment are shown


  Contribution of Bax and Bak in apoptotic response to ZER was confirmed by comparing
  sensitivities of SV40 immortalized MEF derived from WT and DKO mice. The ZER treatment
  caused a dose-dependent increase in the apoptotic cells in both WT and DKO MEF,
  but the apoptosis was significantly more pronounced in the WT MEF than in the DKO.
  Collectively, these results indicated that: ZER treatment caused activation of both
  Bax and Bak, and Bax and Bak deficiency conferred significant protection against
  ZER-induced apoptosis in immortalized MEF. The WT and DKO MEF is a better cellular
  model to test the role of Bax and Bak over RNA interference which often fails to
  produce complete knockdown if simultaneously attempted for more than one protein.




  We determined the effect of ZER administration on growth of MDA-MB-231 cells implanted
  orthotopically in mammary fat pads of female SCID mice. The ZER concentrations used
  in the present study were within the range utilized in previous animal studies .
  The initial and final body weights of the control and ZER-treated mice did not differ
  significantly. In this experiment, luciferase expressing MDA-MB-231 cells were used
  with the intention to image the mice as well as to quantify bioluminescence. However,
  this was not possible because the number of effective mice was smaller than initially
  planned and due to variability inherent to bioluminescence. Nevertheless, the average
  wet weight of the tumor after sacrifice of the animals was significantly lower in
  the 0.18 mg ZER/mouse group compared with control group. The difference between
  the control group and the 0.35 mg ZER/mouse group did not reach statistical significance
  due to large data scatter in the later. Nevertheless, these results demonstrated
  in vivo efficacy of ZER against MDA-MB-231 xenografts.

  apoptotic bodies in representative tumor section of a control mouse and a mouse

  representative tumor section of a control mouse and a mouse of the 0.35 mg/mouse
  group. Results shown are mean. Significantly different compared with control by
  one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s test




  ZER administration resulted in a statistically significant increase in number of
  apoptotic bodies in the tumor as visualized by TUNEL assay. In addition, expression
  of proliferation marker Ki-67  was significantly lower in the tumors of ZER-treated
  mice compared with those of control mice, and the difference was significant at
  the 0.35 mg ZER/mouse group.




  Results presented herein indicate that ZER treatment inhibits survival of human
  breast cancer cells regardless of the estrogen responsiveness or the p53 status.
  Growth inhibitory effect of ZER is associated with cell cycle arrest and apoptosis
  induction. Activity of ZER against breast cancer is not restricted to cultured cells
  as growth of MDA-MB-231 xenografts in vivo is significantly retarded by ZER administration.
  Consistent with cellular data, antitumor effect of ZER in vivo is accompanied by
  reduced cell proliferation as evidenced by Ki-67 expression and increased apoptosis.
  Moreover, ZER administration is well tolerated by the mice and does not cause weight
  loss or any other side effects. Prevention of induced cancers in rodents by ZER
  has been documented previously , but the present study is the first published report
  showing in vivo efficacy of this compound against transplanted breast cancer cells.
  These observations provide impetus for future in vivo evaluation of ZER for prevention
  of mammary cancer in preclinical models to justify its clinical investigation as
  a chemopreventive agent. In this context, it is important to mention that addition
  of a different variety of ginger to standard antiemetic therapy in patients with
  advanced breast cancer effectively reduces the prevalence of chemotherapy-induced
  nausea and vomiting . In a phase II study, ginger root extract decreased eicosanoids
  in colon mucosa in people at normal risk for colorectal cancer .


  The present study shows that breast cancer cells are arrested in G2/M phase of the
  cell cycle after treatment with ZER. While these observations are consistent with
  the literature data showing G2/M phase cell cycle arrest in ZER-treated leukemia,
  ovarian and cervical cancer cells , our data also indicates that the cell cycle
  arrest resulting from ZER exposure is irreversible. The G2/M progression is regulated
  by a kinase complex consisting of cyclin B1 and Cdk1  and ZER treatment down regulates
  both these proteins. Downregulation of cyclin B1 and Cdk1 upon treatment with ZER
  has also been observed in leukemia cells . The Cdc25 family phosphatases play an
  important role in activation of the cyclin B1/Cdk1 complex. The ZER-treated cells
  exhibit a decrease in protein levels of both Cdc25B and Cdc25C. However, the cell
  cycle arrest resulting from ZER treatment is not dependent on p53, which is a therapeutic
  advantage because this tumor suppressor is often mutated in human cancers including
  breast cancer .


  The present study indicates that PUMA protein, which is involved in regulation of
  apoptosis by different stimuli including some natural products , is dispensable
  for apoptosis induction by ZER. Likewise, unlike certain other proapoptotic agents
  , Bcl-2 overexpression has no meaningful impact on ZER-induced apoptosis. We also
  demonstrate that ZER causes activation of Bax and Bak but has only modest effect
  on their protein levels. Effect of ZER on Bak level or activation has not been examined
  previously to the best of our knowledge, but in leukemia cells ZER treatment had
  no effect on Bax protein expression . A critical role for Bax in apoptosis induction
  by ZER has been reported in human colon cancer cells . The ZER-induced apoptosis
  in colon cancer cells is associated with reactive oxygen species production . Interestingly,
  examples exist to illustrate critical role of reactive oxygen species in Bax activation
  and apoptosis induction by some stimuli, including natural products phenethyl isothiocyanate
  and Withaferin A . It is possible that Bax and Bak activation by ZER in breast cancer
  cells is linked to production of reactive oxygen species. Further work is needed
  to experimentally verify this possibility.
