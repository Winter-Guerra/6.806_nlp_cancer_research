  was shown to have anti-inflammatory activity through the suppression of cyclooxygenase-2
  gene expression and enzyme activity. It is also reported to exhibit anti-platelet
  activity, but the mechanism underlying this action remains unknown. In this study,
  we investigated a putative anti-platelet aggregation mechanism involving arachidonic
  acid metabolism and how this compares with the mechanism by which it inhibits macrophage
  inflammatory responses; METHODS: Rabbit platelets and murine macrophage RAW264.7
  cells were treated with piperine, and the effect of piperine on the activity of
  AA-metabolizing enzymes, including cytosolic phospholipase A2, COX-1, COX-2, and
  thromboxane A2 synthase, as well as its effect on AA liberation from the plasma
  membrane components, were assessed using isotopic labeling methods and enzyme immunoassay
  kit; RESULTS: Piperine significantly suppressed AA liberation by attenuating cPLA2
  activity in collagen-stimulated platelets. It also significantly inhibited the activity
  of TXA2 synthase, but not of COX-1, in platelets. These results suggest that piperine
  inhibits platelet aggregation by attenuating cPLA2 and TXA2 synthase activities,
  rather than through the inhibition of COX-1 activity. On the other hand, piperine
  significantly inhibited lipopolysaccharide-induced generation of prostaglandinE2
  and PGD2 in RAW264.7 cells by suppressing the activity of COX-2, without effect
  on cPLA2; CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that piperine inhibits platelet aggregation
  and macrophage inflammatory response by different mechanisms. \n\n\npepper; piperine;

  phenomenon that culminates in the formation of hemostatic plugs and arterial thrombi,
  which are recognized as potential sources of thromboembolic complications manifesting
  as atherosclerosis, heart attack, stroke, and peripheral vascular disease. Platelets
  are activated by various agonists, such as collagen and platelet-activating factor,
  and undergo a cascade of events that results in the enzymatic metabolism of arachidonic
  acid . AA is derived from the plasma membrane by the action of phospholipase A2,
  and undergoes further metabolism by cyclooxygenases and TXA2 synthase to form eicosanoid
  products such as prostaglandins, thromboxanes, and other oxygenated derivatives
  . Similarly, activated macrophages participate in the inflammatory response by,
  among other roles, producing eicosanoid pro-inflammatory mediators through the stimulation
  of the same AA metabolic cascade that controls the platelet aggregation. Therefore,
  the modulation of eicosanoid mediators by targeting the enzymes involved in AA metabolism
  is regarded as a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of thrombosis
  and chronic inflammatory diseases .\n\nPiperine is a primary alkaloid constituent
  in black and long pepper, and has been shown to exhibit diverse biological actions,
  including anti-cancer, anti-angiogenesis, anti-oxidant, and anti-degenerative properties,
  as well as to enhance drug bioavailability . Recent studies have demonstrated that
  piperine also possesses anti-inflammatory properties, elicited by the inhibition
  of PGE2 generation through suppression of COX-2 gene transcription and protein expression
  . With regard to putative anti-platelet activity, piperine and piperine-enriched
  ethanol extract of Piper longum L. have been reported to inhibit platelet aggregation
  in vitro , but the underlying mechanism is currently poorly understood.\n\nIn this
  study, we investigated a putative anti-platelet aggregation mechanism involving
  AA metabolism by assessing the effect of piperine on the activity of AA-metabolizing
  enzymes, including cPLA2, COX-1, and TXA2 synthase, as well as its effect on AA
  liberation from the plasma membrane components. Furthermore, we evaluated the differences
  in the inhibitory action of piperine on the activities of AA-metabolizing enzymes
  in platelet aggregation and macrophage inflammatory responses.\n\n\n\n\n\nPiperine
  was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Collagen and AA were purchased from Chrono-Log
  Co.. TXB2, PGD2, PGE2, and methyl-arachidonyl-fluorophosphonate were purchased from
  Cayman Chemical Co.. AA and 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine
  were purchased from PerkinElmer, Inc.. Cell culture materials were purchased from
  Gibco-BRL. Bacterial lipopolysaccharide from Escherichia coli, NS-398 , indomethacin,
  and imidazole were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich.\n\n\n\nTwo-month-old male New Zealand
  white rabbits were purchased from Samtako Bio Korea Inc. and acclimated for 1 week
  at a temperature of 24 ± 11 °C and a humidity of 55% ± 5%. The animals had free
  access to a standard rabbit pellet diet and drinking water before experiments. Fresh
  blood was collected from the ear artery of New Zealand White rabbits and the anti-coagulant
  1% EDTA was added in the ratio 1:9. Platelet-rich plasma was obtained by centrifugation
  at 230× g for 10 min at room temperature. The platelets separated from the PRP were
  washed twice with HEPES buffer, as described previously . The platelets were counted
  by Coulter counter and adjusted to the cell concentration of 3 × 108 platelets/mL
  in HEPES buffer for subsequent experiments. All animal studies were carried out
  at Soonchunhyang University. This study was conducted in accordance with the ethical
  guideline of the Soonchunhyang University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n\n\n\nRAW264.7
  cells, obtained from American Type Culture Collection, were cultured in Dulbecco’s
  modified eagle medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum,
  100 U/mL of penicillin, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin at 37 °C under humidified air
  containing 5% CO2 inside a CO2 incubator. Cells were plated in 35-mm culture dishes
  at 6 × 105 cells for the following experiments.\n\n\n\nPlatelet aggregation was
  measured using the turbidimetric method with a four-channel aggregometer as described
  previously . Briefly, platelets were incubated at 37 °C for 3 min in the aggregometer
  with piperine at a range of concentrations in the presence of 1 mM CaCl2. Platelet
  aggregation was induced by the sequential addition of collagen, AA, and U46619.
  The maximal platelet aggregation rate was recorded over 10 min with continuous stirring.
  The percentage of platelet aggregation following incubation with each inducing agent
  was calculated by the following formula:/Xmax vehicle-treated, where Xmax is the
  maximum aggregation rate of vehicle- or piperine-treated platelets in each aggregation
  assay. IC50 values were determined from the concentration-response curves of logarithmic
  plots of test substance concentration vs. % inhibition of aggregation).\n\n\n\nFor
  the measurement of AA liberation, isotopic labeling methods for platelets and macrophages
  were used as described previously . Briefly, PRP or RAW264.7 cells were incubated
  with AA at 37 °C for 1.5 h or 24 h, respectively. Following incubation, labeled
  platelets were washed with HEPES buffer, while RAW264.7 cells were washed with PBS
  containing 0.01% BSA. In order to assess the effect of piperine on AA liberation,
  labeled platelets were treated with 100, 200, and 300 μM piperine for 3 min in HEPES
  buffer containing 1 mM CaCl2, while RAW264.7 cells were treated with 10, 50, and
  10 μM piperine for 24 h with DMEM containing 0.01% BSA in the presence of 100 μM
  BW755C. The platelets were treated with collagen for 10 min, while RAW264.7 cells
  were incubated with LPS for 12 h to stimulate AA liberation. The reaction was terminated
  by the addition of ice-cold chloroform/methanol/HCl. Lipids were extracted and separated
  by thin-layer chromatography on Silica Gel G plates using petroleum ether/diethyl
  ether/acetic acid as the developing system. The area corresponding to free fatty
  acids and other lipids was scraped off the TLC plate, and the radioactivity of each
  fraction was determined by liquid scintillation counting. The radioactivity signal
  corresponding to the liberated AA was corrected by adjusting the total radioactivity.\n\n\n\nFor
  the cPLA2 assay, the PRP and RAW264.7 cells were treated with a range of concentrations
  of piperine as described above. To assess the effect of piperine on cPLA2 activity
  in collagen-stimulated platelets, piperine-pretreated PRP was stimulated by incubation
  with collagen for 1.5 h, and the mixture was centrifuged and lysed as described
  by Hashizume et al. . The lysates were subsequently centrifuged at 100,000× g at
  4 °C for 1 h, and the cPLA2 activity in the resultant supernatant was determined
  as previously described . Briefly, the supernatant was incubated with a mixture
  of SAPC and unlabeled SAPC at 37 °C for 15 min in the presence of 5 mM dithiothreitol,
  a secretory PLA2 inhibitor. After lipid extraction, liberated AA was analyzed as
  described above, and the enzyme activity was calculated.\n\nTo assess the effect
  of piperine on cPLA2 activity in LPS-stimulated macrophages, piperine-pretreated
  RAW264.7 cells were stimulated by 1 μg/mL for 1 h, and the cells were collected
  and lysed as described previously . The lysates were centrifuged and the cPLA2 activity
  in the resultant supernatant was determined as described above.\n\n\n\nRAW264.7
  cells were cultured for 24 h, and then labeled with AA at 37 °C for 24 h as described
  above. In order to assess the effect of piperine on PGs generation in LPS-stimulated
  RAW264.7 cells, labeled cells were treated with piperine at a range of concentrations
  for 24 h, and then stimulated by 1 μg/mL LPS for 12 h. Lipids in the medium and
  cells were extracted and separated by TLC using an upper phase of ethyl acetate/isooctane/acetic
  acid/water as the developing system. The area corresponding to each PG was scraped
  off, and the radioactivity of each fraction determined by liquid scintillation counting.\n\n\n\nWe
  measured the conversion of exogenous AA to TXB2, PGE2, and PGD2 as an index of COX
  activity as described previously . In order to assess the effect of piperine on
  platelet COX-1 activity, PRP was treated with piperine at a range of concentrations
  for 3 min in the presence of 1 mM CaCl2, and subsequently incubated with a mixture
  of AA and unlabeled AA for 10 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of
  a stop solution. Lipids were extracted and the radioactivity corresponding to TXB2
  and PGD2 was measured as described previously . To assess the effect of piperine
  on macrophage COX-2 activity, RAW264.7 cells were treated with piperine at a range
  of concentrations for 24 h. The cells were stimulated with LPS in the presence of
  a mixture of AA and unlabeled AA for 1 h. Following the extraction of lipids from
  the medium and cells, the radioactivity of PGE2 and PGD2 were determined as described
  above.\n\n\n\nIn platelets, TXA2 synthase catalyzes the conversion of PGH2 to TXA2,
  a potent inducer of aggregation. Because TXA2 is highly unstable, we measured the
  concentration of the stable metabolite TXB2 formed from PGH2 in rabbit platelets
  as described previously . In order to assess the effect of piperine on platelet
  TXA2 synthase activity, PRP was treated with piperine at a range of concentrations
  for 3 min in the presence of 50 μM COX inhibitor indomethacin in an aggregometer
  cuvette, and subsequently incubated with 5 μM PGH2 for 3 min. The reaction was terminated
  by the addition of a 2 mM EGTA stop solution containing 0.1 M KCl and placing the
  mixture on ice. The content of the cuvette was transferred to an Eppendorf tube
  and centrifuged at 13,000× g at 4 °C for 4 min. TXB2 concentration in the supernatant
  was measured using an enzyme immunoassay kit.\n\n\n\nData are as means ± standard
  deviation of the indicated number of experiments. Student’s t-test was used for
  statistical analysis. A p value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe
  have previously reported that piperine isolated from Piper longum L. exerts anti-platelet
  activity . To investigate a possible mechanism of action, the current study investigated
  the anti-platelet activity of this new piperine compound. Piperine inhibited collagen-
  and AA-induced platelet aggregation in a concentration-dependent manner, with IC50
  values of 158.0 and 134.2 μM, respectively. However, piperine showed only a mild
  inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation induced by TXA2 receptor agonist U46619
  .\n\nFigure 1. Piperine inhibited the induction of platelet aggregation by collagen
  and arachidonic acid, but not U46619. Chemical structure of piperine; Piperine-dependent
  inhibition of platelet aggregation. Washed platelets were pre-incubated with piperine
  for 3 min in the presence of 1 mM CaCl2 and stimulated with 1 μg/mL collagen, 100
  μM AA, or 1 μM U46619 in an aggregometer. The change in light transmission of the
  platelet suspension following 10 min of stimulation with each agonist was normalized
  to the light transmission of suspensions treated without piperine. Each point represents
  the mean ± S.D. of three separate experiments. \n\n\nFigure 1. Piperine inhibited

  following 10 min of stimulation with each agonist was normalized to the light transmission
  of suspensions treated without piperine. Each point represents the mean ± S.D. of
  three separate experiments.\n\n\n\nPGs are as one of the major inflammatory mediators
  . Therefore, we measured the generation of PGs, focusing on PGE2 and PGD2, in murine
  macrophages as a marker of pro-inflammatory processes. In our efforts to identify
  the optimal conditions for the induction of PGs generation in AA-labeled RAW264.7
  cells, a time-course study showed that maximal generation of PGE2 and PGD2 occurred
  at 12 h post LPS stimulation, whereas PBS as a vehicle control was found to elicit
  no changes on the basal level of PGs. In subsequent studies, we investigated the
  effect of piperine on PGs generation in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells under experimental
  conditions determined to be optimal, i.e., stimulation with 1 μg/mL LPS for 12 h.
  Piperine significantly inhibited the generation of both PGE2 and PGD2 in a concentration-dependent
  manner, with IC50 values of 7.7 and 10.1 μM, respectively. These results were similar
  to the findings reported by Ying et al. .\n\nFigure 2. Piperine inhibited the generation
  of PGE2 and PGD2 in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. AA-labeled cells were treated
  with 1 μg/mL LPS or PBS, and an evaluation of the time-course of LPS-induced generation
  of PGE2 and PGD2 was performed by quantifying the radioactivity signal of metabolites.
  AA-labeled cells were treated with piperine or vehicle for 24 h, and stimulated
  with 1 μg/mL LPS for 12 h. We measured the radioactivity signal corresponding to
  PGE2 and PGD2;. Data are expressed as means ± S.D. of three separate experiments.

  of suppression of platelet aggregation and anti-inflammatory activities, we tested
  the effect of piperine on AA liberation in collagen-stimulated platelets and LPS-stimulated
  RAW264.7 cells. In fully aggregated, collagen-stimulated platelets, AA liberation
  increased significantly by 6.7-fold, relative to the unstimulated control cells.
  Treatment of platelets with the same piperine concentrations used in the platelet
  aggregation assay significantly suppressed collagen-induced AA liberation in a concentration-dependent
  manner. In contrast, treatment of RAW264.7 cells with 10 to 100 μM piperine, which
  showed a significant inhibition of prostaglandin generation, did not affect LPS-induced
  AA liberation. These results suggest that piperine may affect platelet aggregation
  and inflammation through different mechanisms of action. Since piperine was observed
  to suppress AA liberation in collagen-stimulated platelets, we further tested the
  effect of piperine on the activity of cPLA2, an enzyme that catalyzes the release
  of AA from the platelet membrane phospholipids . We found that piperine significantly
  inhibited collagen-induced cPLA2 activity in a concentration-dependent manner, while
  eliciting no effect on LPS-stimulated cPLA2 activity in RAW264.7 cells. We further
  confirmed that, under our experimental condition, cPLA2 inhibitor MAFP  significantly
  suppressed cPLA2 activity in both platelets and RAW264.7 cells. Taken together,
  these findings suggest that piperine attenuates cPLA2 activity and suppresses AA
  liberation during platelet aggregation, but not in macrophage inflammation.\n\nFigure

  cells were treated with a range of concentrations of piperine or vehicle, as presented
  in the graphs. The liberation of AA in platelets stimulated by 10 μg/mL collagen
  and in RAW264.7 cells stimulated by 1 μg/mL LPS was determined by measuring the
  radioactivity. Data are expressed as means ± S.D. of three separated experiments.

  previous studies have demonstrated that piperine inhibits inflammation through a
  suppression of COX-2 gene transcription and protein expression , the effect of piperine
  on the activity of other COX enzymes, particularly the COX-1 isozyme, remains unexplored.
  To address this knowledge gap, we evaluated the effect of piperine on COX activity
  by measuring the conversion of exogenous AA into metabolites such as TXB2 and prostaglandins,
  as an index of COX-1 and COX-2 activities. We found that the conversion of exogenous
  AA into TXB2 in platelets was significantly inhibited by piperine, while the conversion
  of AA to PGD2 was not affected. Both conversions were inhibited by indomethacin,
  a potent COX-1 inhibitor. Interestingly, we further found that TXA2 synthase activity
  was significantly inhibited by piperine. These results indicate that piperine inhibits
  the generation of TXB2 from released AA in the platelets by the suppression of TXA2
  synthase activity, but not through a direct suppression of COX-1 activity. In contrast,
  treatment of RAW264.7 cells with piperine significantly inhibited the conversion
  of AA into prostaglandins PGE2 and PGD2 in a concentration-dependent manner. Taken
  together, these findings demonstrate that piperine inhibits the generation of eicosanoids
  by suppressing the activities of COX-2 and TXA2 synthase, but does not affect COX-1
  activity.\n\nFigure 5. Piperine inhibited the activity of COX-2, but not COX-1.
  The conversion of exogenous AA to thromboxane and prostaglandins were measured as
  a reflection of COX activity. Platelets and RAW264.7 cells were treated with a range
  of concentrations of piperine, DMSO, 50 μM indomethacin, or 1 μM NS-398, as presented
  in the graphs. Platelets and RAW264.7 cells were subsequently incubated with a mixture
  of AA and the unlabeled AA for 10 min. The radioactivity corresponding to TXB2 and
  PGD2 measured in platelets was an index of COX-1 activity, while PGE2 and PGD2 signal
  measured in RAW264.7 cells corresponded to COX-2 activity. Data are expressed as
  means ± S.D..  p &lt; 0.05 vs. vehicle controls. \n\n\nFigure 5. Piperine inhibited

  vs. vehicle controls.\n\n\n\nCollectively, our results demonstrate that piperine
  is a bioactive alkaloid compound that exhibits activity against platelet aggregation
  and the macrophage inflammatory response through the regulation of the AA-metabolizing
  enzymes. Additionally, we demonstrated that piperine suppresses the enzyme activity
  of cPLA2 and TXA2, but not COX-1, in collagen-stimulated platelets. Conversely,
  piperine was shown to suppress the activity of COX-2, but not cPLA2, in LPS-stimulated
  RAW264.7 macrophage cell line.\n\nPiperine is an alkaloid from the Piper species
  that has been reported to inhibit platelet aggregation. However, the mechanism of
  the anti-platelet aggregation action of piperine remains unknown. Piperine has been
  previously shown to inhibit the expression of COX-2, a key enzyme in the AA metabolic
  pathway, resulting in a decreased production of PGE2 in the inflammatory responses.
  We therefore investigated a possible anti-platelet mechanism of piperine through
  the modulation of the AA metabolic pathway. Moreover, we compared the effects of
  piperine on the liberation of AA and the activities of AA-metabolizing enzymes in
  collagen-stimulated platelets and LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. In our study, piperine
  inhibited collagen- and AA-induced platelet aggregation but did not affect the response
  to U46619. These findings suggest that the anti-platelet activity of piperine may
  be mediated through the inhibition of collagen- and AA-stimulated platelet activation
  cascades, rather than through direct antagonism of the TXA2 receptor. Additionally,
  piperine was found to inhibit the generation of PGE2 and PGD2 in LPS-stimulated
  RAW264.7 cells. We also found that piperine has different ranges of effective concentration
  on platelet aggregation and macrophage inflammatory responses, respectively. Comparing
  the anti-platelet aggregation and anti-inflammatory activities of piperine, our
  results showed that the IC50 values for the inhibition of platelet aggregation were
  higher than those determined for the inhibition of macrophage inflammatory response.
  This suggests that the murine macrophages RAW264.7 cells are more sensitive to piperine
  than rabbit platelets, but the pharmacological basis of this difference is unclear.
  Previous studies have demonstrated that the active concentrations of piperine vary,
  depending on the cell type and animal species in which its effects are assessed
  . Therefore, through further mechanism studies, we evaluated the activity of piperine
  at concentrations that exhibited inhibitory activity in each of the platelet aggregation
  assay and RAW264.7 prostaglandin-generation experiments.\n\nAA, which is released
  from the membrane phospholipids by the action of PLA2, is a substrate for the generation
  of eicosanoids through further enzymatic metabolism. We demonstrated that the increased
  liberation of AA in collagen-stimulated platelets and stimulation of RAW264.7 cells
  by LPS was suppressed by piperine in platelets, but not in RAW264.7 cells. Furthermore,
  piperine significantly inhibited the collagen-induced activity of cPLA2 in platelets,
  with the inhibitory effect corresponding to the suppression of AA liberation and
  platelet aggregation. Conversely, piperine did not affect LPS-induced cPLA2 activity
  in macrophages. These results indicated that piperine may selectively inhibit cPLA2
  activity depend on the stimulus response pathway. This suggests that piperine may
  affect collagen-induced platelet aggregation and LPS-stimulated macrophage inflammatory
  response through distinct mechanisms.\n\nCOX is the key enzyme required for the
  conversion of AA to eicosanoids, and two isoforms COX-1 and COX-2 are well known
  and characterized. COX-1 is constitutively expressed in most of tissues and functions
  in normal cell physiology, and the other inducible COX-2 is expressed in response
  to inflammatory stimuli such including LPS . A recent study demonstrated that COX-1
  expression and activity is not significantly regulated by LPS stimulation in macrophages,
  although basal level of COX-2 is expressed . In contrast, the amount of COX-2 in
  platelets exists at very low amounts .This suggests that platelets and macrophages
  differentially express COX-1 or COX-2 in different physiological situations . In
  our current study, we showed that piperine effectively inhibits the conversion of
  exogenous AA into PGE2 and PGD2 in RAW264.7 cells, which is a reflection of its
  effect on COX-2 activity. This finding is consistent with previous observations
  demonstrating that piperine decreases the production of pro-inflammatory mediators
  by inhibiting the COX-2 gene transcription and protein expression in vitro and in
  vivo. COX-1, a COX isozyme constitutively expressed in the platelets, mediates the
  synthesis of eicosanoids, including TXA2 and PGD2, responsible for platelet activation
  and aggregation. Since the effect of piperine on COX-1 has not been studied yet,
  we investigated the effect of piperine on the activity of this isozyme in platelets.
  We found that piperine significantly inhibited the conversion of exogenous AA into
  TXB2, but not PGD2, a metabolite formed by COX-1 activity. This result indicates
  that the inhibition of TXB2 generation from AA by piperine is not dependent on COX-1
  activity.\n\nTXA2 synthase is an important AA-metabolizing enzyme, which converts
  PGH2 into TXA2 following the generation of PGH2 by COX-1 from AA in the platelets
  . Interestingly, we found that TXA2 synthase activity was significantly inhibited
  by piperine, indicating that piperine inhibits TXB2 generation from AA in platelets
  by the suppression of TXA2 synthase activity, rather than through the suppression
  of COX-1 activity. While our results do not rule out the possibility of the involvement
  of other piperine-targeted enzymes, our findings clearly demonstrate that piperine
  inhibits the generation of eicosanoid mediators from AA by the suppression of TXA2
  synthase in platelets and selective inhibition of COX-2 in macrophages.\n\n\n\nIn
  conclusion, as summarized in Figure 6, piperine inhibits platelet aggregation by
  inhibiting cPLA2 and TXA2 activities but does not affect COX-1. In contrast, piperine
  inhibits macrophage inflammatory response by inhibiting COX-2 activity without effects
  on cPLA2. This demonstrates that piperine inhibits both platelet aggregation and
  macrophage inflammatory response via regulation of the AA-metabolizing pathways,
  but by different inhibitory effects on the metabolic enzymes. Further studies are
  warranted to determine the exact mechanism of inhibition of the activities of AA-metabolizing
  enzymes of piperine, and to investigate how it can be used in anti-thrombotic and
  anti-inflammatory therapies.\n\nFigure 6. Scheme of the proposed mechanism by which
  piperine inhibits platelet aggregation and macrophage inflammatory processes. This
  study demonstrated that piperine inhibits both platelet aggregation and macrophage
  inflammatory responses. Treatment with piperine was shown to suppress AA liberation
  through the inhibition of cPLA2 activity in platelets, but not in macrophages. Additionally,
  piperine inhibits the activities of TXA2 synthase and COX-2, but not COX-1. Piperine
  inhibits cPLA2 and TXA2 activities, suppressing platelet aggregation through decreased
  TXA2 generation. Piperine-dependent inhibition of COX-2 activity results in a suppression
  of the macrophage inflammatory response through decreased prostaglandin generation.
