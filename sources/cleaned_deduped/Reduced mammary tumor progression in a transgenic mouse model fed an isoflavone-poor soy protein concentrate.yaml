  Dietary exposure to soy has been associated with reduced breast cancer incidence.
  Soy isoflavones and protein components, such as protease inhibitors and the lunasin
  peptide, have been indicated as potential agents reducing carcinogenesis. In this
  study, the effect of soy-based diets was evaluated in a transgenic mouse model of
  breast carcinoma, overexpressing the neu oncogene. Neu female mice were fed for
  20 wk a soy- and isoflavone-free diet, 4RF21 laboratory mouse diet, soy-based, thus
  isoflavone-rich, or AIN-76-based semisynthetic diets with a soy protein isolate
  or an isoflavone-poor soy protein concentrate as protein source. Mice were then
  sacrificed and tumors removed. Mammary tumor weights were not different in SPI versus
  IFD and STD fed mice. In contrast, mice fed IPSP showed reduced tumor progression
  versus IFD and STD groups. Moreover, IPSP fed mice showed lower bromo-2â€²-deoxyuridine
  incorporation into breast tumor cells compared to STD and SPI fed animals. Lung
  metastases were detected in 80% of IFD fed mice, in 70% of mice fed STD and SPI,
  and only in 50% of the IPSP fed animals. These results indicate that a diet containing
  an isoflavone-poor soy protein concentrate may inhibit breast tumor progression
  and metastasis development.'
