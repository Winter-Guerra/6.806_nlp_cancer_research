  Seaweed is one of the largest producers of biomass in marine environment and is
  a rich arsenal of active metabolites and functional ingredients with valuable beneficial
  health effects. Being a staple part of Asian cuisine, investigations on the crude
  extracts of Phaeophyceae or brown algae revealed marked antitumor activity, eliciting
  a variety of research to determine the active ingredients involved in this potential.
  The sulfated polysaccharide of fucoidan and carotenoid of fucoxanthin were found
  to be the most important active metabolites of brown algae as potential chemotherapeutic
  or chemopreventive agents. This review strives to provide detailed account of all
  current knowledge on the anticancer and antitumor activity of fucoidan and fucoxanthin
  as the two major metabolites isolated from brown algae.




  Cancer is a debilitating disease which has afflicted a noticeable proportion of
  the entire population of the world in all generations . The development of resistance
  to chemotherapy is considered a major hindrance to treatment of various cancers,
  as a notable proportion of tumors relapses and develops resistance, eventually resulting
  in multidrug resistance following exposure to multiple anticancer drugs with prevalent
  structure and mechanisms of action . Furthermore, ideally anticancer agents should
  act exclusively against tumor cells; however, numerous chemotherapeutic drugs which
  are presently being used for cancer patients exhibit considerable adverse side effects
  on the human body, namely, bleeding, hair loss, diarrhea, and immunosuppression
  . Hence, discovery of new natural products and metabolites isolated from microorganisms,
  animals, and plants possessing high efficacy against tumor cells without any toxicity
  on normal cells is a big leap in scientific researches. Apoptosis as a highly regulated
  programmed cell death has become a matter of great interest in cancer therapy and
  oncology because of the high potential of various chemotherapeutic agents in inducing
  apoptosis in a variety of cancer cells . Thus, screening for natural products capable
  of inducing apoptosis in cancer cells that can be used alone or in combination with
  other chemotherapeutic drugs has now been in progress in order to elevate the therapeutic
  effects and reduce the side effects in cancer therapy .


  The growing body of experimental and epidemiological evidence supporting the preventive
  role of marine products in controlling chronic diseases such as cancer has stimulated
  significant scientific interest in characterizing the active ingredients of marine
  products. Marine algae as part of diets and traditional remedies in the Eastern
  Hemisphere are still underexploited plant resources. Due to their unique living
  environment, algae are rich in bioactive constituents such as phycocyanin, terpenes,
  fucosterol, and polysaccharides . Extensive beneficial health effects of marine
  algae have highlighted their role as a source of functional ingredients in recent
  years . A variety of biological activities are attributed to marine algae including
  neuroprotection, antitumor, anticancer, antioxidant, antiobesity, anti-inflammatory,
  and antimicrobial, antiangiogenic, and other biological activities . Hence, it is
  clearly documented that in vivo and in vitro studies with marine algae compounds
  continue to be extremely active in recent history .


  Brown algae or Phaeophyceae characterized by their natural pigments form an important
  group of marine algae . Different types of brown algae including wakame, kombu,
  and hijiki are staples in East Asians diet, especially Japan and Korea . Viscous
  components including gepsin, porphyran, alginic acid, and oligosaccharide protecting
  the seaweed from invasion of bacteria that are involved in different health benefits
  of brown algae are clear illustrations of the importance and diversity of the constituents
  isolated from Phaeophyceae . Thus, the active constituents of brown algae have been
  subjected to a variety of studies in recent years. This review briefly describes
  the antitumor potential of various brown algae species and summarizes the antitumor
  activity of fucoidan and fucoxanthin as the two main metabolites isolated from brown
  algae and the mechanisms underlying this activity.




  The extensive research on the crude extracts of various brown algae isolated from
  different marine environments against different cancer cell lines shows promising
  anticancer potential. The study on antiproliferative activity of crude extracts
  of ten Phaeophyta species isolated from Brittany coasts against three human cancers,
  human leukaemic T cell lymphoblast, human Burkitts lymphoma, and human chronic myelogenous
  leukaemia cells, showed strong antitumor potential of Sargassaceae species, Dictyota
  dichotoma, and Desmarestia ligulata . The crude methanol extract of the marine algae
  isolated from Aegean Shores of Turkey demonstrated strong inhibitory effect of Padina
  pavonica and Cystoseira mediterranea brown algae against human breast adenocarcinoma
  and human prostate cancer cells . The in vitro investigation on the enzymatic extract
  of Ecklonia cava together with its crude polyphenolic and polysaccharide fractions
  showed antiproliferative activity against murine colon cancer cell line, human leukemia,
  mouse melanoma, and human leukemia cells. The polyphenolic extract showed the strongest
  activity against CT-26 cells through apoptotic cell demise according to the nuclear
  staining experiment .


  The in vivo studies on tumor suppressive activity of brown algae signified the importance
  of the in vitro anticancer potential of these seaweeds for cancer therapy. The investigation
  on the antitumor activity of the powdered tissue from 21 species of air-dried brown
  algae against Ehrlich carcinoma in mice showed significant inhibitory effect of
  S. ringgoldianum, L. japonica, Lessonia nigrescens, and Scytosiphon lomentaria after
  oral administration of seaweed powder for 28 days . In another study, wakame, the
  most popular edible seaweed in Japan, exhibited marked inhibitory effect against
  7,12-dimethylbenz(a)-anthracene-induced rat mammary tumor associated with apoptosis.
  The results suggested induction of apoptosis via expression of transforming growth
  factor-β through transportation of iodine from serum into mammary tissues . The
  aqueous extract isolated from the sporophyll of U. pinnatifida also showed strong
  in vivo and in vitro antitumor activity against breast cancer cells. It indicated
  significant antiproliferative activity against three kinds of human breast cancer
  cells, namely, MCF-7, T-47D, and MDA-MB-231, through an induction of apoptosis.
  Mekabu solution when used in daily drinking water revealed significant suppressive
  activity on rat mammary carcinogenesis, without any toxicity to normal cells. The
  inhibitory effect of Mekabu proved to be stronger than some of the widely used chemotherapeutic
  agents against breast cancer . This remarkable anticancer and antitumor potential
  shown by various brown algae led scientists to isolate a variety of constituents
  and metabolites involved in the respective activities. The sulfated polysaccharide
  of fucoidan and carotenoid of fucoxanthin were found to be the most important active
  metabolites of brown algae as potential chemotherapeutic or chemopreventive agents.




  Fucoidan is a class of sulfated polysaccharides enriched with fucose in the extracellular
  matrix of brown algae. Fucoidans have demonstrated various biological activities
  including antiviral, anti-inflammatory, anticoagulant, antiangiogenic, immunomodulatory,
  and anti-adhesive activity . Due to possible differences in the chemical structure,
  the biological effects of this compound proved to be noteworthy depending on the
  species from which it is isolated . Thereby, fucoidan as a fucose-containing sulfated
  heteropolysaccharide is not uniform and its structure highly differs depending on
  the species source of isolation . Furthermore, the constituents of fucoidan also
  differ with the species by small proportions of D-mannose, D-xylose, D-galactose,
  and uronic acid. Industrial scale of fucoidan has been prepared to be used as an
  additive to drinks, health foods, and cosmetics in Japan .

  from brown seaweed. R groups depict the potential places for attachment of noncarbohydrate
  and carbohydrate substituents.


  In the 1980s, the study of fucoidan in xenograft mouse models elicited antitumor
  and antimetastatic effects which attracted the attention of researchers in conducting
  more detailed studies on the antitumor and anticancer potential of this marine product
  . The antitumor activity of 31 polysaccharide fractions isolated from S. thunbergii
  when evaluated against Ehrlich carcinoma transplanted in mice revealed the antitumor
  potential of fucoidan or L-fucan containing roughly 30% sulfate ester groups per
  fucose residue, less than 2% protein, and approximately 10% uronic acid . The variety
  of research on fucoidan revealed several critical factors involved in the marked
  antitumor potential of this polysaccharide.


  The antiangiogenic activity of fucoidan isolated from Fucus vesiculosus explained,
  at least in part, the mechanism of the antitumor potency. Further study showed that
  fucoidan possessed strong inhibitory activity on tube formation following migration
  of human umbilical vein endothelial cells and its chemical oversulfation increased
  the inhibitory potential. Both natural as well as oversulfated fucoidans remarkably
  reduced the chemotactic and mitogenic roles of the vascular endothelial growth factor
  165 on HUVEC due to antagonistic effect on the binding of VEGF165 to its cell surface
  receptor . However, oversulfated fucoidan revealed stronger suppressive effect,
  suggesting a critical role of the number of sulfate groups in the fucoidan molecule.


  Antitumor activity of fucoidan demonstrated antiproliferative activity in Lewis
  lung carcinoma and B16 melanoma in mice. According to their results, the number
  of sulfate groups in the fucoidan molecule is directly correlated with the potency
  of its anti-angiogenic and thereby antitumor effects . In another study, enzyme-digested
  fucoidan extracted from Mozuku seaweed Cladosiphon novae-caledoniae Kylin revealed
  significant anti-angiogenic activity on human uterine carcinoma HeLa cells by reducing
  the expression and secretion of VEGF leading to attenuation of vascular tubules
  formation of tumor cells. Fucoidan also significantly reduced the invasion potential
  of human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells possibly through suppression of the matrix metalloproteinases
  MMP-2/9 activities. It is suggested that these effects may be explained, at least
  partially, by the antioxidative potential of fucoidan extracts .


  Another factor involved in the antitumor activity of fucoidan proved to be its ability
  to enhance the immune response. The study on fucoidan extracted from S. thunbergii
  revealed significant inhibitory effect against the growth of Ehrlich ascites carcinoma
  in mice without any sign of toxicity. The results showed enhancement in the immune
  response of mice by increasing the phagocytosis activity of macrophages . Prolonged
  survival rate of P-388 tumor-bearing mice treated with fucoidan isolated from the
  sporophyll of U. pinnatifida was associated with roughly 2-fold elevation in the
  IFN-gamma produced by T cells. This result suggested the involvement of IFN-gamma-activated
  NK cells in the antitumor activity of fucoidan . In another in vivo study, single
  and repeated administration of fucoidan from F. evanescens indicated antimetastatic
  and antitumor activity in C57BL/6 mice with transplanted Lewis lung adenocarcinoma.
  Furthermore, treatment with fucoidan at a dose of 10 mg/kg body weight potentiated
  the antimetastatic effect of cyclophosphamide . The chemoresistance in non-small-cell
  human bronchopulmonary carcinoma cells was significantly reduced by fucoidan extracted
  from Ascophyllum nodosum with an arrest observed in the G1 phase of the cell cycle.
  An in vivo study on the NSCLC-bearing nude mice also revealed the antitumor effect
  of fucoidan at subtoxic doses .


  Induction of apoptosis as a critical factor in cancer therapy and oncology also
  contributed to significant antitumor activity of this sulfated polysaccharide. Cytotoxicity
  activity of fucoidan from F. vesiculosus demonstrated antiproliferative activity
  on human lymphoma HS-Sultan cell line via apoptosis induction accompanied with caspase-3
  activation. The partial inhibition of apoptosis by pretreatment with pan-caspase
  inhibitor, Z-VAD-FMK, suggested the involvement of caspase-independent proapoptotic
  pathways, while the decrease in the mitochondrial membrane potential in HS-Sultan
  cells after 24 h treatment with fucoidan demonstrated the role of mitochondrial
  pathway. Furthermore, reduced phosphorylation of ERK and GSK observed after 24 h
  treatment with fucoidan also suggested that the ERK pathways are involved in the
  induced apoptosis in human HS-Sultan cells . Fucoidan isolated from C. okamuranus
  was found to reduce the damage induced by anticancer drug 5-fluorouracil in Hs 677.st
  normal stomach cells, despite minimum inhibition on the original activity of 5-FU
  in stomach cancer cell line. Further study of fucoidan demonstrated antiproliferative
  activity on stomach cancer cells without any effects on normal stomach cells . According
  to a more recent study, fucoidan isolated from C. okamuranus inhibited the proliferation
  of MCF-7 cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner without any effect on the viability
  of normal human mammary epithelial cells. Their results indicated that fucoidan
  induced apoptosis via caspase-8-dependent pathway which was characterized by chromatin
  condensation, internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, cleavage of poly(ADP ribose) polymerase,
  and activation of caspase-7, caspase-8, and caspase-9. Fucoidan was found to decrease
  cytosolic Bax and significantly elevate cytosolic cytochrome c . The critical role
  of caspase-8 in fucoidan-induced apoptosis was indicated via inhibition of caspase-8
  by the specific caspase-8 inhibitor z-ITED-FMK which resulted in the inactivation
  of caspase-7, caspase-8, and caspase-9 and a series of changes in cytochrome c,
  Bid, and Bax expression and thereby suppression in the cytotoxicity of fucoidan
  . Since digestive enzymes in human small intestine are not able to hydrolyze fucoidan
  and its consumption can lead to an elevation in the concentration of luminal fucoidan
  within the large intestine, it may be a potent chemopreventive agent for colon cancer
  . HT-29 and HCT116 treated with fucoidan extracted from F. vesiculosus demonstrated
  a dose-dependent antiproliferative effect and induction of apoptosis mediated through
  both the mitochondria-mediated and death receptor-mediated pathways. In addition,
  their results indicated that fucoidan induced apoptosis via the death receptor-mediated
  pathway through both the direct and indirect activation of caspase-3 in HT-29 cells.
  These results indicated that fucoidan is a potentially useful therapeutic agent
  for colon cancer by simultaneous activation of different apoptotic factors and pathways
  . In human leukemia cell line, the antiproliferative activity by oversulfated fucoidan
  was more potent compared to the native fucoidan isolated from C. okamuranus that
  greatly highlighted the role of sulfate groups in the fucoidan molecule. The results
  indicated that oversulfated fucoidan induced apoptosis in U937 cells through caspase-3
  and caspase-7 activation-dependent pathway . Furthermore, fucoidan extracted from
  F. vesiculosus induced apoptosis in HCT-15 cells via activation of pro-caspase-9
  and pro-caspase-3 and downregulation of Bcl-2. Additionally, fucoidan-induced apoptosis
  was accompanied by the strong activation of p38 kinase and ERK and the inhibition
  of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signal pathway in HCT-15 cells . Fucoidan
  isolated from the sporophyll of Korean brown seaweed U. pinnatifida which is chemically
  defined as O-acetylated sulphated galactofucan also exhibited antitumor activity
  in A549, HepG2, HeLa, and PC-3 cells, in a similar pattern to that of commercial
  fucoidan .


  Interaction of tumor cells with platelets was found to be a critical factor in the
  initial steps favoring tumor metastasis . Fucoidan isolated from L. saccharina,
  L. digitata, F. serratus, F. distichus, and F. vesiculosus demonstrated roughly
  80% reduction in the adhesion of MDA-MB 231 tumor cells to human platelets in vitro.
  However, fucoidan extracted from A. nodosum and F. evanescens revealed 66% and 78%
  inhibitory effect, respectively . The results proved the potential use of fucoidans
  for development of new drugs against tumor progression. It also proved the influence
  of fucoidan origin on their composition and thereby biological activities. Activation
  of the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways of apoptosis, increase in the immune response,
  suppression of angiogenesis, and reduction in the adhesion of tumor cells to human
  platelets are suggested as mechanisms responsible for significant antitumor activity
  of fucoidan.

  Carotenoids as a group of natural pigments with more than 600 members possess a
  variety of biological activities including radical scavenging, immunomodulation,
  singlet oxygen-quenching activity, and other pharmacological effects . Carotenoids
  include two main subclasses of nonpolar hydrocarbon carotenes and polar compounds
  named xanthophylls. One well known example of xanthophylls for anticancer activity
  is fucoxanthin . Fucoxanthin with a unique carotenoid structure including an allenic
  band and a 5,6-monoepoxide is a major nonprovitamin A carotenoid isolated from brown
  seaweed . This orange-colored pigment carotenoid contributes more than 10% of the
  total carotenoids in nature, particularly in the marine ecosystem, albeit, besides
  brown algae, fucoxanthin was also isolated from diatoms .


  Free radical scavenging activity of fucoxanthin was suggested to be the mechanism
  underlying its anticancer effect. An in vitro study by Okuzumi and colleagues  on
  the inhibitory activity of fucoxanthin against GOTO cell line showed 68% inhibitory
  effect at 10 μg/mL concentration after 3 days. A decrease in the expression of N-myc
  gene after 4 h treatment of fucoxanthin and cell cycle arrest in the G0-G1 phase
  were associated with the growth reduction in GOTO cells . In another in vivo study
  on duodenal carcinogenesis induced by N-ethyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine in mice
  revealed that consumption of drinking water treated with 0.005% fucoxanthin in dimethyl
  sulfoxide for 12 weeks significantly reduced the average number of tumors per mice
  and the percentage of tumor-bearing mice compared to the control group . Further
  study demonstrated the inhibitory effect of fucoxanthin on liver tumorigenesis in
  C3H/He male mice and two-stage skin carcinogenesis in ICR mice . Chemopreventive
  activity of fucoxanthin isolated from Hijikia fusiforme on the development of putative
  preneoplastic aberrant crypt foci in the colon of B6C3F1 male mice induced by 1,2-dimethylhydrazine
  dihydrochloride proved the potential of fucoxanthin as a chemopreventive agent against
  colon carcinogenesis. Treatment with fucoxanthin in the drinking water of the mice
  for 7 weeks significantly decreased the ACF/mouse from 63.3 for the control group
  to 47.1 value . These promising antitumor results shown by fucoxanthin warranted
  the various detailed investigations for determining the exact mechanisms underlying
  such a strong antitumor potential.


  Antitumor activity of fucoxanthin isolated from U. pinnatifida against human leukemic
  HL-60 cells showed significant inhibitory effect on HL-60 proliferation in a dose-dependent
  manner. Treatment of HL-60 with 11.3 μM and 45.2 μM of fucoxanthin for 24 h reduced
  the viability to 46.0% and 17.3% compared to the control value, respectively. Induction
  of DNA fragmentation by fucoxanthin implied apoptosis for reduced proliferation
  of HL-60 cells . The cytotoxicity of fucoxanthin isolated from U. pinnatifida was
  investigated in three lines of human prostate cancer cells, namely, PC-3, DU 145,
  and LNCaP. According to their results, 72 h treatment with fucoxanthin significantly
  reduced cell viability to 9.8% for LNCaP, 5.0% for DU 145, and 14.9% for PC-3. Induction
  of DNA fragmentation by fucoxanthin detected by TUNEL assay suggested that apoptosis
  is responsible for the reduction in cell viability of human prostate cancer cells
  . Fucoxanthin was found to induce apoptosis in PC-3 cells via caspase-3 activation
  associated with reduction in the expression of Bax and Bcl-2 proteins without any
  change in the protein level of Bcl-XL. This unique response in the expression of
  Bcl-2 family proteins in PC-3 cells suggested a mechanism different from the other
  apoptosis-inducing agents which modulate the ratios of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL protein
  levels with the expression of Bax protein. After 48 h treatment with fucoxanthin,
  the level of apoptotic cells characterized by DNA fragmentation showed an increased
  percentage of hypodiploid cells, morphological changes, and cleavages of caspase-3
  and PARP polymerase) escalated to 30% . In another study, fucoxanthin isolated from
  U. pinnatifida revealed a remarkable inhibitory activity against the viability of
  human colon cancer cell lines through apoptosis which was evidenced by DNA fragmentation.
  Treatment with 22.6 μM of fucoxanthin in Caco-2 cells increased DNA fragmentation
  effect by 10-fold compared to the control which was partially inhibited by caspase
  inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk. Fucoxanthin also suppressed the level of Bcl-2 protein revealed
  by western blot analysis. Effective decrease in Caco-2 cell viability caused by
  a combined treatment of 10 μM of troglitazone as a specific ligand for peroxisome
  proliferator-activated receptor γ and 3.8 μM of fucoxanthin demonstrated potential
  complementary chemopreventive or chemotherapeutic activity of fucoxanthin on colon
  cancer .


  The metabolic fate of fucoxanthin in mice and HepG2 cells revealed its conversion
  into two metabolites, fucoxanthinol and amarouciaxanthin A. It is suggested that
  prior to absorption in the intestine, fucoxanthin is hydrolyzed into fucoxanthinol
  in the gastrointestinal tract which is later converted to amarouciaxanthin A in
  the liver. The proposed metabolic pathway of dietary fucoxanthin in mammals is presented
  in Figure 2. In another study, fucoxanthin, fucoxanthinol, and amarouciaxanthin
  A demonstrated IC50 values of 3.0 μM, 2.0 μM, and 4.6 μM, respectively, suggesting
  that fucoxanthinol was the most active metabolite of fucoxanthin against PC-3 cells
  . Further in vitro study of fucoxanthin isolated from U. pinnatifida showed significant
  inhibitory effect against HCT116 cells, although it did not significantly reduce
  the growth of HUC-Fm and MRC-5 as normal cells. The results suggested the safety
  of fucoxanthin against normal cells at 5 μM concentration which is cytotoxic against
  cancer cell lines. Nevertheless, at the concentration of 10 μM, fucoxanthin exhibited
  a significant dose-dependent growth reduction in HCT-116 cells as well as normal
  cells, HUC-Fm, and MRC-5 . It also showed significant inhibitory effect on the proliferation
  of WiDr cells after 24 h in a dose-dependent manner.



  Mechanistically, fucoxanthin against HCT-116 and WiDr cells demonstrated cell cycle
  arrest at G0/G1 phase via upregulation of  as a mechanism for the antiproliferative
  and apoptosis inducing potential of fucoxanthin which may be related to the antitumorigenic
  effect . Treatment with fucoxanthin after 24 h also reduced the phosphorylation
  of the retinoblastoma protein at Serine 807/811 and Serine 780 in WiDr cells which
  is a crucial factor for the progression of G1 phase and the transition of G1 to
  S phase. Nonetheless, at a concentration of 25 μM, no change was reported in the
  protein levels of the cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and D-types of cyclin, whose complexes
  are attributed to the phosphorylation of Rb at these sites, while treatment at concentrations
  higher than 50 μM of fucoxanthin reduced their protein expression. These molecular
  changes led to apoptosis in colon cancer cells at concentrations higher than 50
  μM after 48 h treatment . Investigation of the precise mechanism for the inhibitory
  activity of fucoxanthin against prostate cancer DU145 and human hepatocellular carcinoma
  HepG2 cell lines when assessed by DNA microarray and flow cytometry revealed induction
  of G1 arrest and GADD45A gene expression, a cell cycle related gene, without induced-apoptosis.
  Additionally, fucoxanthin also induced GADD153 and PIM1 expressions in HepG2 and
  DU145 cells, although CYP1A1, an activator of pro-carcinogens, was significantly
  expressed in HepG2 cells . In addition, the study on the molecular mechanism of
  the inhibitory effect of fucoxanthin against HepG2 cells revealed induction of cell
  cycle arrest at G0-G1 phase. This inhibitory effect was associated with suppression
  in the phosphorylation of Rb at Serine780 and downregulation in the kinase activity
  of cyclin D and cdk4 complex, which is responsible for the phosphorylation of Rb
  at Ser780 site. Cyclin D suppression was attributed to both the transcriptional
  repression and protein degradation assessed by RT-PCR and western blotting analysis
  .


  Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 infection is responsible for the Adult T-cell
  leukemia which is a fatal malignancy of T lymphocytes . Fucoxanthin isolated from
  U. pinnatifida and its metabolite, fucoxanthinol, showed inhibitory effect against
  cell viability of ATL cells as well as HTLV-1-infected T cells without cytotoxicity
  effect on normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells and uninfected cell lines. However,
  fucoxanthinol was found to be roughly two times more potent than fucoxanthin. The
  investigation of the mechanism responsible for this activity showed that decreasing
  the expression of cdk4, cdk6, cyclin D1, and cyclin D2 in association with upregulation
  of GADD45α caused cell cycle arrest at G1 phase . Additionally, activation of caspase-3,
  caspase-8, and caspase-9 proved the induction of apoptosis. Nuclear factor-κB and
  activator protein-1 were also inactivated due to suppression of IκBα phosphorylation
  and JunD expression. The results were confirmed by in vivo study of fucoxanthinol
  which caused inhibition of tumor formation in mice with severe combined immunodeficiency
  harboring tumors induced by inoculation of HTLV-1-infected T cells . The antitumor
  activity by fucoxanthin and possible mechanisms underlying the inhibitory effect
  in MGC-803 cells revealed dose-dependent elevation in the ratio of cells in G2/M
  phase and apoptotic cells. This inhibitory effect was associated with significant
  reduction in the expression of survivin, STAT3 and CyclinB1. The decrease in the
  expression of CyclinB1 and STAT3 was attenuated by combined treatment of fucoxanthin
  and AG490 as the inhibitor for JAK/STAT signal pathway while the survivin expression
  was increased. The results indicated the possible role of JAK/STAT signal pathway
  in the induction of fucoxanthin antitumor activity .


  Besides direct anticancer activity, the in vitro and ex vivo investigations of fucoxanthin
  also revealed the anti-angiogenic effect of this carotenoid as a complementary potential
  for cancer prevention. Treatment with fucoxanthin at concentrations greater than
  10 μM showed significant suppressive effect on the proliferation of human umbilical
  vein endothelial cells and tube formation without any significant activity on HUVEC
  chemotaxis. In addition, 10-20 μM concentration of fucoxanthin markedly suppressed
  the formation and development of blood vessel-like structures from CD31-positive
  cells using embryonic stem cell-derived embryoid bodies . These results suggest
  that fucoxanthin can be a potential suppressor of differentiation of endothelial
  progenitor cells into endothelial cells through disruption in new blood vessel formation.
  The ex vivo angiogenesis study of fucoxanthin and fucoxanthinol using a rat aortic
  ring demonstrated suppression of microvessel outgrowth in a dose-dependent manner.
  The noteworthy angiogenic activity of fucoxanthin might be beneficial for suppression
  of the cancer aggravation . It is suggested that extensive antitumor activity of
  fucoxanthin and its metabolites which is summarized in Table 2 is possibly attributed
  to the presence of 5,6 monoepoxide in the fucoxanthin molecule as one of the contributing
  factors .


  Table 2: Anticancer and antitumor activity of fucoxanthin and its metabolites isolated
  from brown algae.




  The extensive biological activities mentioned for brown algae include the transcendent
  anticancer and antitumor effect of fucoidan and fucoxanthin as the two crucial metabolites
  isolated from various species of Phaeophyceae. Activation of the intrinsic and extrinsic
  pathway of apoptosis, increase in the immune response, suppression of angiogenesis,
  and reduction in the adhesion of tumor cells to human platelets are suggested as
  mechanisms responsible for significant antitumor activity of fucoidan. The superiority
  of antitumor strength shown by oversulfated fucoidan over natural fucoidan exhibited
  the critical role of the number of sulfate groups in this molecule. Carotenoid of
  fucoxanthin and to more extent its metabolite, fucoxanthinol, demonstrated noteworthy
  antitumor activity associated with the free radical scavenging potential, induction
  of apoptosis, and the anti-angiogenic effect. It is hoped that this review would
  be a fountain of motivation and guidance for the interested researchers in conducting
  further preclinical and clinical studies leading to the development of new chemotherapeutic
  or chemopreventive agents derived from the metabolites of brown algae.
