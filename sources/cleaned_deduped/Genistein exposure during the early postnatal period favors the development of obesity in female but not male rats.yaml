  exposure during the early postnatal period favors the development of obesity in
  female but not male rats.md
text: '


  Genistein, the primary isoflavone in soy, has been shown to adversely affect various
  endocrine-mediated endpoints in rodents and humans. Soy formula intake by human
  infants has been associated with early age at menarche and decreased female-typical
  behavior in girls. Adipose deposition and expansion are also hormonally regulated
  and Gen has been shown to alter these processes. However, little is known about
  the impact of early-life soy intake on metabolic homeostasis in adulthood. The current
  study examined the impact of early-life Gen exposure on adulthood body composition  and
  the molecular signals mediating adipose expansion. From postnatal day  1 to 22,
  rat pups were daily orally dosed with 50mg/kg Gen to mimic blood Gen levels in human
  infants fed soy formula. Female but not male Gen-exposed rats had increased fat/lean
  mass ratio, fat mass, adipocyte size and number, and decreased muscle fiber perimeter.
  PND22 Gen-exposed females, but not males, had increased expression of adipogenic
  factors, including CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha, CCAAT/enhancer binding
  protein beta, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma. Furthermore,
  Wingless-related MMTV integration site 10b, a critical regulator of adipogenic cell
  fate determination, was hypermethylated and had decreased expression in adipose
  of PND22 Gen-exposed females. These data suggest that developmental Gen exposure
  in rats has gender-specific effects on adiposity that closely parallel the effects
  of a postweaning high-fat diet and underscore the importance of considering timing
  of exposure and gender when establishing safety recommendations for early-life dietary
  Gen intake. '
