  Hydrogen peroxide can induce cell damage by generating reactive oxygen species,
  resulting in DNA damage and cell death. The aim of this study is to elucidate the
  protective effects of fisetin against H2O2-induced cell damage. Fisetin reduced
  the level of superoxide anion, hydroxyl radical in cell free system, and intracellular
  ROS generated by H2O2. Moreover, fisetin protected against H2O2-induced membrane
  lipid peroxidation, cellular DNA damage, and protein carbonylation, which are the
  primary cellular outcomes of H2O2 treatment. Furthermore, fisetin increased the
  level of reduced glutathione and expression of glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic
  subunit, which is decreased by H2O2. Conversely, a GSH inhibitor abolished the cytoprotective
  effect of fisetin against H2O2-induced cells damage. Taken together, our results
  suggest that fisetin protects against H2O2-induced cell damage by inhibiting ROS
  generation, thereby maintaining the protective role of the cellular GSH system.







  Flavonoids are a group of low-molecular weight polyphenolic compounds synthesized
  by plants. Many of these compounds exhibit a wide range of biological activities,
  including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-tumor effects. Fisetin is widely
  distributed among fruits and vegetables and is found in plant tissues at concentrations
  of 2–160 μg/g. Fisetin exhibits a wide variety of activities, including anti-cancer,
  anti-angiogenic, neuroprotective, neurotrophic, radioprotective, and antioxidant
  effects. Reactive oxygen species cause oxidative modifications to DNA, proteins,
  lipids, and small intracellular molecules. Lipids, including pulmonary surfactants,
  react with ROS to produce lipid peroxides, which cause increased membrane permeability
  and inactivation of surfactants. In turn, reaction of ROS with cellular proteins
  leads to decreased protein synthesis due to the modification of proteins involved
  in translation and translocation, ultimately resulting in impaired cellular metabolism.
  In addition, ROS damage nucleic acids by modifying purine and pyrimidine bases and
  by causing DNA strand breakage. The oxidative stress induced by the overproduction
  of ROS has been associated with many clinical conditions including cancer, asthma,
  cystic fibrosis, ischemia-reperfusion injury, drug-induced toxicity, and aging.


  Glutathione is the most prevalent low-molecular weight antioxidant in cells. Reduced
  glutathione protects cellular constituents from oxidative damage, either by reacting
  directly with oxidants or acting as a substrate for radical scavenging by glutathione
  peroxidase. Notably, decreased GSH concentrations are associated with cell damage,
  depressed immunity, and cataracts. Moreover, GSH depletion increases the susceptibility
  of cells to stress-induced cell death. Our results demonstrate that fisetin protects
  cells from H2O2-induced damage by scavenging ROS and inducing cellular GSH systems.

  Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts cells obtained from the American Type Culture Collection
  were maintained at 37°C in an incubator with a humidified atmosphere containing
  5% CO2. The cells were cultured in Dulbeccos modified Eagles medium supplemented
  with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, streptomycin, and penicillin.




  Superoxide anion was generated by xanthine and xanthine oxidase, which were then
  quickly reacted with DMPO, a nitrone spin trap. The resulting adducts were detected
  by electron spin resonance spectrometry using a JES-FA ESR spectrometer, 2.5 min
  after being mixed in a phosphate buffer solution with 20 μl 3 M DMPO, 20 μl 10 mM
  xanthine, 20 μl 0.25 U xanthine oxidase, and 2.5 μg/ml fisetin. The parameters of

  scan width, 10 mT; time constant, 0.03 second; and temperature, 25°C.




  Hydroxyl radical was generated by the Fenton reaction and then quickly reacted with
  DMPO. The resultant adducts were detected by ESR spectrometry as described above,
  2.5 min after being mixed in a phosphate buffer solution with 0.2 ml of 0.3 M DMPO,
  0.2 ml of 10 mM FeSO4, 0.2 ml of 10 mM H2O2, and 2.5 μg/ml fisetin. The parameters

  The DCF-DA method was used to measure the levels of intracellular ROS. For image
  analysis of intracellular ROS, cells were seeded on cover slip-loaded six-well plates
  at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well. At 16 h after plating, the cells were treated
  with 2.5 μg/ml of fisetin; 1 h later, 1 mM H2O2 was added to the wells. The media
  were replaced, and 100 μM DCF-DA was added to each well and incubated for an additional
  30 min at 37°C. After washing with PBS, the stained cells were mounted onto microscope
  slides in mounting medium. Images were collected on a confocal microscope using
  the laser scanning microscope 5 PASCAL software. Cells were seeded in a 96-well
  plate at a density of 2 × 104 cells/well. At 16 h after plating, the cells were
  treated with 2.5 μg/ml of fisetin; 30 min later, 1 mM H2O2 was added to the plate,
  and the cells were incubated for an additional 30 min at 37°C. Next, 25 μM of DCF-DA
  solution was added and incubated for 10 min, and then the fluorescence of 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein
  was detected using a Perkin Elmer LS-5B spectrofluorometer. The intracellular ROS-scavenging
  activity was calculated as 100 × /(optical density of H2O2 treatment).




  Lipid peroxidation was estimated using the fluorescent probe DPPP as described previously.
  Image analysis to detect lipid peroxidation was achieved by seeding cells on a cover
  slip-loaded four-well glass slide at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well. Cells were
  treated with 2.5 μg/ml fisetin; 1 h later, 1 mM H2O2 was added to the plate. Six
  hours later, 5 μM DPPP was added to each well, and the samples were incubated for
  an additional 15 min in the dark. After washing with PBS, the stained cells were
  mounted onto a microscope slide in mounting medium. Microscopic images of DPPP fluorescence
  were detected by using a confocal microscope with the laser scanning microscope
  5 PASCAL program.




  Lipid peroxidation was assayed by colorimetric determination of the amount of 8-isoprostane
  secreted into the culture medium by V79-4 cells. A commercial enzyme immunoassay
  was employed according to the manufacturers instructions.




  A comet assay was performed to determine the degree of oxidative DNA damage. A cell
  suspension was mixed with 75 μl of 0.5% low-melting agarose at 39°C and spread on
  a fully frosted microscopic slide pre-coated with 200 μl of 1% normal-melting agarose.
  After the agarose had solidified, the slide was covered with an additional 75 μl
  of 0.5% low-melting agarose and then immersed in a lysis solution for 1 h at 4°C.
  The slides were then placed in a gel electrophoresis apparatus containing 300 mM
  NaOH and 10 mM Na-EDTA for 40 min to allow for DNA unwinding and expression of alkali-labile
  damage. Next, an electrical field was applied for 20 min at 4°C to draw the negatively
  charged DNA toward the anode. After electrophoresis, the slides were washed three
  times for 5 min at 4°C in a neutralizing buffer, and then stained with 75 μl propidium
  iodide. The slides were observed with a fluorescence microscope and image analyzer.
  The percentage of total fluorescence in the tail and the tail length were recorded
  in 50 cells per slide.




  Cells were treated with 2.5 μg/ml fisetin and after 1 h, 1 mM H2O2 was added to
  the plate, and the mixture was incubated for a further 24 h. The level of protein-carbonyl
  formation was determined using an Oxiselect protein-carbonyl ELISA kit purchased
  from Cell Biolabs, according to the manufacturers instructions. Cellular protein
  was isolated using protein lysis buffer, 10 mM EDTA, and 1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl
  fluoride, and then quantified using a spectrophotometer.




  For image analysis of the level of intracellular GSH, cells were seeded on cover
  slip-loaded six-well plates at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well. After 16 h, cells
  were treated with 2.5 μg/ml of fisetin; 1 h later, 1 mM H2O2 was added to the plate.
  After changing the media, 100 μM of avidin was added to each well and the samples
  were incubated for an additional 30 min at 37°C. After washing with PBS, the stained
  cells were mounted onto microscope slides in mounting medium. Images were collected
  on a confocal microscope using the laser scanning microscope 5 PASCAL software.
  The cellular levels of GSH were measured colorimetrically using the Bioxytech GSH-400™
  kit.




  Cells were treated with 2.5 μg/ml fisetin and, 1 h later, with 1 mM H2O2. Next,
  the cells were incubated for 24 h at 37°C, harvested, and then washed twice with
  PBS. The harvested cells were then lysed on ice for 30 min in 100 μl lysis buffer  and
  centrifuged at 13,000×g for 15 min. Supernatants were collected from the lysates,
  and the protein concentrations were determined. Aliquots of the lysates were boiled
  for 5 min and electrophoresed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred
  by blotting onto nitrocellulose membranes and subsequently incubated with primary
  antibodies. Next, membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated
  anti-IgG secondary antibodies and then exposed to X-ray film. Protein bands were
  detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting detection kit.




  To determine the effect of fisetin on cell viability following H2O2 treatment, cells
  were treated with 2.5 μg/ml fisetin; 1 h later, 1 mM H2O2 was added to the plate,
  and the mixture was incubated for a further 24 h. Fifty microliters of  bromide
  stock solution was then added to each well to attain a total reaction volume of
  200 μl. After incubation for 4 h, the plate was centrifuged at 800×g for 5 min,
  and the supernatants were aspirated. The formazan crystals in each well were dissolved
  in 150 μl of dimethylsulfoxide and read at A 540 on a scanning multi-well spectrophotometer.
  To determine the effect of a GSH inhibitor on cell viability, cells were pre-treated
  with a final concentration of 50 mM BSO for 30 min, incubated with fisetin for 30
  min, and then exposed to 1 mM H2O2 for 12 h, after which cell viability was measured
  by the MTT assay.




  All measurements were made in triplicate, and all values are expressed as the means
  ± standard error of the mean. The results were subjected to an analysis of variance
  using Tukeys test to analyze differences. A p ; 0.05 was considered significant.






  We recently reported that fisetin exhibited cytotoxicity at concentrations higher
  than 2.5 μg/ml in V79-4 cells. Therefore, 2.5 μg/ml was chosen as the optimal dose
  of fisetin for further study. First, we investigated the effect of fisetin on scavenging
  of superoxide anion and hydroxyl radical. It was used ESR spectrometry to detect
  the superoxide anion generated by xanthine and xanthine oxidase in a cell-free system.
  No signal was observed for the control and fisetin at 2.5 μg/ml; however, the signal
  of the superoxide anion increased to 3858 in the xanthine and xanthine oxidase systems.
  Fisetin treatment decreased this signal to 2949 Fig. 1A . Next, hydroxyl radical
  generated by the Fenton reaction in a cell-free system were detected by ESR spectrometry.
  No signal was observed for the control and fisetin at 2.5 μg/ml; however, the signal
  of the hydroxyl radical increased to 3791 in the FeSO4 \+ H2O2 system. Fisetin treatment
  decreased this signal to 2834 Fig. 1B . The intracellular ROS-scavenging activity
  of fisetin in V79-4 cells after H2O2 treatment was detected using the DCF-DA assay.
  Confocal microscopy revealed that fisetin reduced the intensity of red fluorescence
  induced by H2O2 treatment Fig. 1C . Moreover, spectrofluorometric data exhibited
  that the level of ROS was lower in fisetin+H2O2-treated cells than in H2O2-treated
  cells Fig. 1D , indicating a reduction of ROS generation by fisetin.



  The scavenging effects of fisetin on radicals in cell-free systems and intracellular
  ROS. Superoxide anion generated in a xanthine/xanthine oxidase system and hydroxyl
  radical generated in a Fe2SO4/H2O2 Fenton reaction system were reacted with DMPO,
  and the resultant DMPO adducts were detected by ESR spectrometry. V79-4 cells were
  treated with 2.5 μg/ml of fisetin for 30 min, and then 1 mM H2O2 was added to the
  plate. After an additional 30 min, intracellular ROS were detected using confocal
  microscopy and fluorescence spectrophotometry following DCF-DA staining.  p &lt;
  0.05, significantly different from control cells; # p &lt; 0.05 significantly different
  from H2O2-treated cells.




  H2O2-induced damage to multiple cellular components is responsible for loss of cell
  viability. Therefore, we investigated the effect of fisetin on damage to membrane
  lipids, DNA, and proteins in H2O2-treated cells. The level of lipid peroxidation
  was increased in H2O2-treated cells, as revealed by visualization of the fluorescent
  probe DPPP by microscopy Fig. 2A . However, fisetin prevented the H2O2-induced peroxidation
  of lipids. Likewise, the cellular concentration of 8-isoprostane significantly increased
  after H2O2 treatment, but this increase was prevented by fisetin Fig. 2B . Next,
  we measured H2O2-induced DNA damage using an alkaline comet assay. H2O2 treatment
  of cells increased the tail length and percentage of DNA in the tails; however,
  fisetin prevented it Fig. 2C . Protein-carbonyl formation is a biomarker for cellular
  oxidative damage. The cellular protein-carbonyl concentration significantly increased
  after H2O2 treatment, and this was prevented by fisetin Fig. 2D .



  The protective effect of fisetin on H2O2-induced cell damage. Cells were treated
  with 2.5 μg/ml fisetin for 1 h, after which 1 mM H2O2 was added and cells were incubated
  for a further 24 h. Lipid peroxidation was detected by confocal microscopy following
  DPPP staining and assayed by measuring the concentration of 8-isoprostane. Images
  and percentage of cellular DNA damage was detected by the alkaline comet assay.
  Protein oxidation was assayed by measuring the amount of carbonyl formation. p &lt;
  0.05, significantly different from control cells; # p &lt; 0.05 significantly different
  from H2O2-treated cells.




  The level of GSH in V79-4 cells was reduced following H2O2 treatment, as revealed
  by visualization of the fluorescent probe CMAC by microscopy Fig. 3A ; however,
  this decrease was prevented by fisetin. Likewise, H2O2 treatment reduced the intracellular
  GSH concentration, but fisetin prevented this decrease Fig. 3B . Glutamate cysteine
  ligase, the rate-controlling enzyme in GSH synthesis, is a heterodimer that can
  dissociate under non-denaturing conditions into catalytic and modulatory subunits,
  which are encoded by separate genes. GCLC contains the entire catalytic activity,
  which is regulated by its association with GCLM. Western blotting analysis was performed
  to confirm the effect of fisetin on GSH at the level of a protein involved in GSH
  synthesis. Fisetin treatment increased GCLC expression in H2O2-treated cells Fig.
  3C . To determine the effect of GSH on fisetin-induced cytoprotection from H2O2-induced
  damage, cells were pre-treated with BSO, a specific inhibitor of GSH. BSO pre-treatment
  abolished the protective effect of fisetin in H2O2-damaged cells Fig. 3D .



  The enhancing effects of fisetin on cellular glutathione systems. Cells were treated
  with 2.5 μg/ml fisetin for 1 h and then with 1 mM H2O2, after which cells were incubated
  for a further 24 h. Levels of GSH were detected by using confocal microscopy after
  staining with the fluorescent probe CMAC and by the GSH content assay. p &lt; 0.05,
  significantly different from control cells, and # p &lt; 0.05, significantly different
  from H2O2-treated cells. Cell lysates were subjected to Western blotting using a
  specific antibody against γ-GCLC. After treatment with BSO, fisetin, and/or H2O2,
  cell viability was determined by the MTT assay.  p &lt; 0.05, significantly different
  from control cells, # p &lt; 0.05, significantly different from H2O2-treated cells,
  and ♦ p &lt; 0.05, significantly different from fisetin + H2O2-treated cells.




  Fisetin, a flavonoid compound with high trolox-equivalent antioxidant capacity,
  is hydrophobic, readily passes through cell membranes, and accumulates intracellularly,
  resulting in high antioxidant activity. A previous study reported that low concentrations
  of flavonoids are protective in cells, whereas high concentrations cause DNA damage
  and apoptosis. In that report, treatment with 50–250 μM fisetin induced cytotoxicity,
  DNA strand breaks, oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation, and caspase-3 activation,
  whereas treatment with fisetin at a concentration less than 50 μM significantly
  protected against the large number of DNA strand breaks caused by 500 μM H2O2. However,
  in our study, fisetin exhibited cytotoxicity in V79-4 cells at concentrations higher
  than 2.5 μg/ml. This discrepancy of concentration may be due to cell type and/or
  culture condition.


  GSH systems play an important role in protecting cells against oxidative stress-induced
  cell death. Therefore, we investigated whether fisetin protects against cell damage
  by activating GSH systems. Fisetin decreased ROS levels and prevented the depletion
  of GSH induced by H2O2-induced cell damage. Fisetin increased the level of GSH and
  expression of γ-GCLC, which is reduced by H2O2. Conversely, a GSH inhibitor abolished
  the cytoprotective effect of fisetin against H2O2-induced cell damage. H2O2 is one
  of the major ROS related to oxidative stress. It easily penetrates cells and proceeds
  to react with intracellular ions such as iron and copper, thereby generating highly
  reactive hydroxyl radical that subsequently attack cellular components including
  lipids, proteins, and DNA to cause various types of oxidative damage. H2O2-induced
  membrane lipid peroxidation is one of the most important lesions responsible for
  the loss of cell viability.


  There are many reports that flavonoids have cytoprotective effects by antioxidant
  effect against oxidative stress. Flavonoids morin, myricetin, and butin showed similar
  cytoprotective effect against oxidative stress compared to fisetin. Ahlenstiel et
  al. demonstrated that cytoprotective effects of fisetin and other flavonoids may
  be due to the integration of flavonoids into membrane lipid bilayers. Due to its
  almost complete three-dimensional planarity, flavonoid can easily interact with
  the ordered structure of lipid bilayers. The hydroxyl group in the B ring in flavones
  with the 2,3-double bond and 4-keto group in C ring allow to exhibiting the cytoprotective
  activity. Therefore, this structure-containing fisetin can contribute to the cytoprotective
  activity against oxidative stress.


  The oxidative damage of DNA, which involves base modification and DNA strand breakage,
  may ultimately lead to genetic alterations. In addition, oxidative damage to amino
  acid residues in proteins results in the formation of carbonyl derivatives. In this
  study, considerable amounts of lipid, DNA, and protein damage were produced in V79-4
  cells after H2O2 exposure; however, fisetin pre-treatment significantly reduced
  all types of damage and consequently protected against cell death. In summary, our
  data demonstrate that fisetin plays an important role in the protective effect against
  H2O2-induced cell damage via direct effect of ROS scavenging and indirect effect
  of ROS scavenging via enhancing of GSH antioxidant capacity.
