  Many anti-tumor drugs function by intercalating into DNA. The xanthine alkaloid
  caffeine can also intercalate into DNA as well as form π-π molecular complexes with
  other planar alkaloids and anti-tumor drugs. The presence of caffeine could interfere
  with the intercalating anti-tumor drug by forming π-π molecular complexes with the
  drug, thereby blocking the planar aromatic drugs from intercalating into the DNA
  and ultimately lowering the toxicity of the drug to the cancer cells. The cytotoxic
  activities of several known DNA intercalators on MCF-7 breast cancer cells, both
  with and without caffeine present were determined. Significant attenuation of the
  cytotoxicities by caffeine was found. Computational molecular modeling studies involving
  the intercalating anti-tumor drugs with caffeine were also carried out using density
  functional theory and the recently developed M06 functional. Relatively strong π-π
  interaction energies between caffeine and the intercalators were found, suggesting
  an "interceptor" role of caffeine protecting the DNA from intercalation . '
