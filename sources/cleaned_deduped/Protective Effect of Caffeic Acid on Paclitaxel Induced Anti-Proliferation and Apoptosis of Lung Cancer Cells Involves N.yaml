  plants. CA possesses multiple biological effects such as anti-bacterial and anti-cancer
  growth. CA was also reported to induce fore stomach and kidney tumors in a mouse
  model. Here we used two human lung cancer cell lines, A549 and H1299, to clarify
  the role of CA in cancer cell proliferation. The growth assay showed that CA moderately
  promoted the proliferation of the lung cancer cells. Furthermore, pre-treatment
  of CA rescues the proliferation inhibition induced by a sub-IC50 dose of paclitaxel,
  an anticancer drug. Western blot showed that CA up-regulated the pro-survival proteins
  survivin and Bcl-2, the down-stream targets of NF-κB. This is consistent with the
  observation that CA induced nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65. Our study suggested
  that the pro-survival effect of CA on PTX-treated lung cancer cells is mediated
  through a NF-κB signaling pathway. This may provide mechanistic insights into the
  chemoresistance of cancer calls. \n\n\n\n\n\nLung cancer is the worldwide leading
  cause of death, and non-small cell lung cancer accounts for 80% of total lung cancer
  cases . Despite the fact that novel chemotherapeutic strategies against NSCLC have
  been developed, the treatments often fail in the majority of patients because of
  the insusceptibility of advanced lung cancer . The rationale of most anti-tumor
  agents is to kill tumor cells by triggering apoptosis signaling pathways. Tumor
  cells may escape from apoptosis and become more chemoresistant. For example, the
  anti-cancer drug, paclitaxel, does not always completely induce apoptosis of tumor
  cells. Instead, tumor cells survive from apoptosis induced by PTX, and become more
  drug-resistant .\n\n3,4-dihydroxy cinnamic acid or CA, a natural phenolic acid product,
  is found in fruits , wine , and coffee . CA has been reported to exert diverse biological
  activities such as anti-bacterial , anti-oxidative  and anti-inflammatory . In addition,
  previous studies demonstrated that CA sensitized multidrug-resistant human breast
  cancer cells towards doxorubicin treatment , and that CA induced apoptosis of cervical
  carcinoma cells . A well-known CA derivative, caffeic acid phenethyl ester, exhibits
  potent anti-cancer effects. Onori’s work reported that CAPE induced anti-proliferation
  and apoptosis of cholangiocarcinoma by inhibiting nuclear factor-κB activation .
  In comparison to the definite anti-cancer effect of CAPE, some studies showed that
  CA could exert protective effects. For example, CA was shown to prevent oxidative
  damage by enhancing antioxidant activity in cells . Furthermore, CA significantly
  protects neurons of cerebellar granule  and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells
  \ from apoptosis. Therefore, the actual effect of CA in chemoresistant cells remains
  unclear.\n\nIn the study, we investigated the effect of CA on proliferation and
  cell death of human lung cancer cells. Our results demonstrated the protective effect
  of CA on paclitaxel-induced cell death in lung cancer cells A549 and H1299, in which
  NF-κB was involved in the protective effect by CA.\n\n\n\n\n\nFurthermore, CA was
  reported to protect liver cells from the attack of reactive oxygen species . In
  addition, CA showed protective effect against cytotoxic damages . Although previous
  studies of CA have focused on its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects , little
  is known about the effect of CA on cancer treatment. Previous studies showed that
  CA induces tumor formation in the fore stomach and kidney in mice . Moreover, it
  has been shown that the combination of CA and anti-cancer drugs reduces the cell
  growth of leukemic monocyte  and inhibits angiogenesis of renal carcinoma cells
  .\n\nTo examine the effects of CA on proliferation of NSCLC cells, the trypan blue
  based-proliferation assay was performed. As shown in Figure 1, CA exerts no significant
  cytotoxicity at the dose 50 and 100 μM towards NSCLC A549 cells. Our results showed
  that CA with a concentration lower than 100 μM has no significant cytotoxic effect
  on A549 cells\n\n\n\nTo examine whether CA affects the anti-proliferation in lung
  cancer cells, PTX, a first-line drug against lung cancer was used in the study.
  In comparison with PTX treatment alone, the proliferation assay showed that 100
  μM of CA pre-treatment significantly rescued the proliferation inhibition induced
  by PTX. Our results demonstrated the protective effect of CA on PTX-induced anti-proliferation
  in NSCLC cells.\n\n\n\nTo determine whether CA protects PTX-induced apoptosis of
  A549 cells, we examined the protein levels of the cleaved caspase-3 and Bid by Western
  blotting. Our results found that PTX treated samples with 100 μM of CA pretreatment
  significantly reduced the level of cleaved caspase-3, a cytosolic indicator for
  apoptosis. Consistently, the protein level of pro-apoptotic factor Bid was decreased
  by CA, indicating the protective effect of CA on PTX-induced apoptosis of A549 cells.\n\nFurthermore,
  the effect of CA was observed at 100 μM of CA but not at 10 μM, suggesting the protective
  effect of CA in a dose-responsive manner.\n\n\n\nSurvivin, a member of inhibitor
  of the apoptosis family, and the pro-survival proteins Bcl-2 have been shown to
  be correlated with carcinogenesis, prognosis  and drug-resistance . Numerous studies
  have demonstrated that down-regulation or inactivation of pro-survival proteins,
  including survivin and Bcl-2 , promotes anti-cancer efficacy or sensitizes tumor
  cells toward chemotherapeutic drugs in human tumor cells .\n\nNext, in order to
  examine how CA attenuates PTX-induced apoptosis of lung cancer cells, Western blot
  for detecting Bcl-2 and survivin was performed. As shown in Figure 4, the results
  showed that pre-treatment of CA induced the accumulation of pro-survival proteins
  Bcl-2 and survivin in A549 and H1299. The anti-apoptotic activity of CA has been
  previously reported to be modulated through a Bcl-2-independent pathway . On the
  contrary, our result showed that the CA mediated anti-apoptosis in lung cancer.
  We also observed that the protein level of survivin in H1299 cells was higher than
  that in A549 cells after CA pre-treatment. Moreover, CA-induced up-regulation of
  survivin was attenuated in H1299 cells with the ectopically expressed wild-type
  p53, indicating the antagonistic role of p53 in the protective effect of CA.\n\nFurthermore,
  CA seems to induce higher levels of survivin and Bcl-2 proteins in H1299 cells,
  which carry non-functional p53 than in A549 cells that carry functional p53. Interestingly,
  CA-induced expression of pro-survival survivin and Bcl-2 proteins in p53-expressing
  H1299 cells was attenuated compared to the parental cells. Accordingly, we suggest
  that p53 may antagonize the protective effect of CA on PTX-induced anti-proliferation
  and apoptosis of lung cancer cells.\n\n\n\nThe transcription factor NF-κB modulates
  genes involved in cell survival, proliferation and apoptosis . The NF-κB p65 is
  the most abundant isoform of NF-κB in cells . Inactivated NF-κB forms a heterodimer
  with an endogenous inhibitor IκB in the cytoplasm . With physiological stimuli or
  stresses, IκB kinases phosphorylate the IκB protein, resulting in the dissociation
  of NF-κB from IκB . The activated NF-κB translocates into the nucleus and turns
  on its target genes . Accumulating evidence has shown that overexpression or constitutive
  activation of NF-κB is common in many cancer cells, including lymphoma , lung cancer
  cells  and liver cancer . Other reports indicate that NF-κB plays a role in chemoresistance
  of breast cancer . Furthermore, it is well known that the expression of anti-apoptotic
  Bcl-2 genes , and the member of inhibitor of apoptosis survivin is the down-stream
  target gene of NF-κB .\n\nTo determine the role of NF-κB p65 in CA-induced protective
  effect, the nuclear/cytosolic fractions of proteins were isolated for Western blot
  analysis. The results showed that PTX decreased the level of NF-κB p65 protein both
  in the cytosol and the nucleus. On the contrary, pre-treatment of CA increased the
  total protein and nuclear extract of NF-κB p65 in A549 cells significantly. These
  results also indicated that higher doses of CA caused nuclear translocation of NF-κB
  p65.\n\nThe transcript factor NF-κB, with anti-apoptosis ability , was found to
  be overexpressed in numerous multidrug-resistant cancer cells . Our results demonstrated
  that the increased level of Bcl-2 and survivin by CA pre-treatment correlated with
  the activity of NF-κB. As expected, we demonstrated that PTX induced cytosolic accumulation
  of NF-κB in A549 cells. However, pre-treatment of CA significantly increased the
  nuclear abundance of NF-κB in PTX-treatment A549 cells at the dose of 100 μM PTX
  but not at the dose of 10 μM. These above results not only suggested that the protective
  effect of CA might involve the activation of the NF-κB p65 pathway, but that the
  CA-induced activation of NF-κB was dose-responsive.\n\n\n\n\n\nHuman non-small cell
  lung cancer cell lines, A549, H1299 as well as H1299 cells transfected with the
  functional wild-type p53 were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented
  with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/mL penicillin, 100 μg/mL streptomycin, 0.03%
  glutamine, and 1 mM sodium pyruvate. Cells were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified
  atmosphere containing 5% CO2.\n\n\n\nPaclitaxel, and Caffeic acid were purchased
  from Sigma-Aldrich. Antibodies against survivin, Bcl-2, survivin, NF-κB p65 and
  β-actin, and antibodies against H3 histone, family 3B were purchased from Abnova.\n\n\n\nCell
  growth was determined by the trypan blue dye exclusion assay as described previously
  . In brief, cells were treated with vehicle control, PTX alone or pre-treated with
  CA for 24 h prior to PTX treatment, respectively. After incubation, cells were exposed
  to 0.2% trypan blue, then counted by the Countess™ automated cell counter.\n\n\n\nThe
  Western blot assay was described previously . Briefly, cells were harvested and
  lysed. Lysates were centrifuged and the protein concentration was determined. Then
  40 μg of protein lysate was separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
  and electrotransferred. Afterwards, the membrane was blocked with 5% non-fat milk,
  followed by incubation with primary and secondary antibodies against specific proteins
  and corresponding antibodies, respectively. The chemiluminescence signals were detected
  by ECL detection kit.\n\n\n\nThe preparation of cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts
  was performed using the Nuclear Extract Kit according to the manual of the manufacturer.
  In brief, 1 × 107 of CA-treated A549 cells were washed with 1 mL ice-cold PBS/phosphatase
  inhibitor, lysed in hypotonic buffer, and then centrifuged at 14,000 g for 30 s
  at 4 °C. The supernatant was transferred into fresh 1.5 microtubes as cytoplasmic
  fraction, then pellets were resuspended in 50 μL complete lysis buffer, and centrifuged
  at 14,000 g for 10 min at 4 °C, supernatants were saved and divided into aliquots.
  The protein concentrations were quantified and analyzed by Western blot assay.\n\n\n\nAll
  data were presented as means ± S.D. The Student’s t-test analysis was used to test
  the mean difference between two groups.\n\n\n\nOur present study demonstrated the
  protective effect of CA on PTX-induced anti-proliferation in NSCLC cells. The protective
  effect of CA is, at least partly, mediated by the NF-κB pathway. Furthermore, the
  protective effect of CA was dose-dependent and depended on cell types. Additionally,
  p53 might act as an antagonist toward the protective effect of CA directly or indirectly.
  In conclusion, our results may shed light on the role of CA in chemotherapy, such
  as PTX-treatment, and this finding could give an important index for PTX-based chemotherapeutics.\n\n\n\nThis
