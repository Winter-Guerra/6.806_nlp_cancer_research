  been found to reduce inflammatory eicosanoids resulting from ω-6 PUFA metabolism
  via competitive inhibition, and the ω-3-induced cytotoxic environment increases
  apoptosis and reduces cell growth in breast cancer cells. To the authors knowledge,
  epidemiologic investigations regarding whether dietary ω-3 PUFA intake benefits
  survival after breast cancer are limited and inconsistent.\n\n\n\nThe authors used
  resources from a population-based follow-up study conducted on Long Island, New
  York, among 1463 women newly diagnosed with first primary breast cancer who were
  interviewed an average of approximately 3 months after diagnosis to assess risk
  and prognostic factors, including dietary intake. Vital status was determined through
  2011, yielding a median follow-up of 14.7 years and 485 deaths. Adjusted hazard
  ratios and 95% confidence intervals were estimated using Cox proportional hazards
  regression.\n\n\n\nAll-cause mortality was reduced among women with breast cancer
  reporting the highest quartile of intake for tuna, other baked/broiled fish, and
  the dietary long-chain ω-3 PUFAs docosahexaenoic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid.\n\n\n\nAll-cause
  mortality was reduced by 16% to 34% among women with breast cancer who reported
  a high intake of fish and long-chain ω-3 PUFAs. Long-chain ω-3 PUFA intake from
  fish and other dietary sources may provide a potential strategy to improve survival
  after breast cancer. Cancer 2015. 2015 American Cancer Society.\n\n\n\n\n\nBreast
  cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death among women in the United States,
  with approximately 40,000 estimated new deaths in 2013. Clinical and demographic
  indicators of breast cancer prognosis include large tumor size, lymph node involvement,
  hormone receptor-negative subtype, early age at diagnosis, and low socioeconomic
  status. Weight maintenance and physical activity may improve survival after breast
  cancer, but because it is a multifactorial disease, it is plausible that additional
  strategies, including intake of specific nutritional factors, would also improve
  survival among women diagnosed with the disease.\n\nOne potential nutritional risk
  reduction strategy is polyunsaturated fatty acids, of which ω-3 and ω-6 are the
  2 primary classes. Inflammatory eicosanoids of arachidonic acid, an ω-6 PUFA, have
  been shown in laboratory studies to increase cell proliferation, metastatic potential,
  aromatase activity, and angiogenesis; and reduce apoptosis and cellular differentiation.
  ω-3 Fatty acids bind to the same enzymes used in AA metabolism and therefore potentially
  lower the levels of inflammatory eicosanoids generated by ω-6 metabolism. In addition,
  the cytotoxic environment induced by ω-3 PUFAs has been reported to increase apoptosis
  and reduce cell growth in transformed and malignant breast cancer cells. Long-chain
  ω-3 PUFAs have demonstrated an ability to chemosensitize breast cancer tumors and
  thus potentially improve treatment efficacy. Therefore, it is plausible that intake
  of ω-3 PUFAs, for which fish is the major dietary source, could provide an opportunity
  to improve survival among women with breast cancer.\n\nDespite this laboratory evidence,
  to the best of our knowledge few epidemiologic studies to date have examined the
  association between dietary PUFA intake and survival after breast cancer. Two studies
  used cross-sectional study designs, thereby limiting inferences regarding the potential
  association between PUFA intake and breast cancer survival. Another study examined
  the relation between adipose tissue biomarkers of PUFA on survival after breast
  cancer and reported no associations; however, the interpretation of the results
  was limited due to the small number of deaths. Thus, the epidemiologic evidence
  of a potential association between dietary PUFA intake and survival among women
  with breast cancer is limited.\n\nPrevious studies examining fish intake and mortality
  among breast cancer survivors are inconsistent. One Japanese investigation followed
  cases for 9 to 12 years and reported increased breast cancer mortality with high
  fish consumption; however, the study population was based on a small number of deaths.
  The second study used participants from the Womens Healthy Eating and Living study,
  a low-fat dietary intervention that manipulated total fat intake, and found that
  higher intake of ω-3 fatty acids from fish was associated with reduced breast cancer
  recurrence and all-cause mortality. However, this United States-based study did
  not assess short-chain ω-3 PUFAs, which are readily obtained in the diet of Western
  populations.\n\nFor the current study, we examined whether a higher intake of fish,
  as well as any other dietary sources of ω-3 PUFAs, was associated with improved
  survival among women diagnosed with breast cancer on Long Island, New York. We also
  considered associations with ω-6 PUFAs and the balance between ω-3 and ω-6 intake.
  To the best of our knowledge, the current study is the first to consider multiple
  PUFA interactions with genes in relation to survival.\n\n\n\nThis follow-up study
  used resources from the Long Island Breast Cancer Study Project, a population-based
  study. Institutional Review Board approval was obtained from all participating institutions.\n\n\n\nWomen
  eligible for the LIBCSP follow-up study were English-speaking residents of Long
  Island, New York who were newly diagnosed with a first primary in situ or invasive
  breast cancer between August 1, 1996 and July 31, 1997. After obtaining physician
  approval, study personnel contacted pathology departments from participating hospitals
  to identify potentially eligible subjects. The final LIBCSP follow-up sample consisted
  of 1508 women with breast cancer. Within approximately 3 months of diagnosis, 98%
  of the patients completed a validated, self-administered, 101-item modified Block
  food frequency questionnaire. Subjects with implausible total energy intake were
  excluded. Thus, the final analytic cohort for this ancillary study included 1463
  women with newly diagnosed breast cancer.\n\nAt the time of diagnosis with the first
  primary breast cancer, participants ranged in age from 20 to 98 years and 67% were
  postmenopausal; 94% of the participants reported their race as white, 4% as black,
  and 2% as other, which reflects the underlying racial distribution of Nassau and
  Suffolk counties at the time of data collection.\n\n\n\nVital status through December
  31, 2011 for all LIBCSP participants was determined via linkage with the National
  Death Index, a standard epidemiologic resource for ascertaining mortality data in
  the United States. We identified women who died from all causes and those whose
  deaths were related to breast cancer. Breast cancer-related deaths were determined
  using the International Classification of Diseases. Among the 1463 participants
  included in the current study, the median follow-up time was 14.7 years after breast
  cancer diagnosis, and we identified 485 total deaths, 210 of which were breast cancer-specific.\n\n\n\nLIBCSP
  participants self-completed the FFQ and were administered a baseline, structured
  questionnaire by a trained interviewer within an average of 3 months after diagnosis.
  The FFQ assessed dietary intake within the year before the interview. Other factors
  assessed included demographic characteristics; reproductive and menstrual history;
  exogenous hormone use, family history of breast cancer, and other medical history;
  body size, physical activity, and alcohol use; active and passive cigarette smoking;
  and occupational history and other environmental exposures. Medical records were
  abstracted to determine tumor characteristics of the first primary breast cancer
  and the first course of treatment for the first primary breast cancer. Concordance
  between the medical record and the self-reported treatment data was high and thus
  the self-reported data were used in the current study.\n\nPUFA intake from any dietary
  source was estimated by linking participant responses from the FFQ with average
  nutrient values for foods included in each line item available in the United States
  Department of Agriculture databases for ω-3 and ω-6 PUFAs. The following PUFA subtypes
  were estimated: 1) ω-3 PUFAs, including ALA, docosapentaenoic acid, DHA, and EPA;
  and 2) ω-6 PUFAs, including linoleic acid and AA. An estimated total ω-3 and ω-6
  PUFA intake was calculated by combining all individual PUFA subtypes. In addition,
  an estimate of total ω-3 and ω-6 PUFA intake was obtained by summing each individual
  fatty acid within each category, representing total ω-3 and ω-6 intakes that are
  commonly consumed among United States populations.\n\nFish and/or seafood consumption
  were also assessed by the FFQ as: 1) tuna, tuna salad, and tuna casserole; 2) shellfish;
  and 3) other fish.\n\n\n\nKaplan-Meier survival curves were constructed and Cox
  proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios and 95%
  confidence intervals to assess the associations between intake of fish as well as
  PUFAs from any dietary source, and all-cause and breast cancer-specific mortality
  for the full 15-years of follow-up. As a sensitivity analysis, we also estimated
  HRs for 5 years of follow-up.\n\nFor regression analyses, the proportional hazards
  assumption was assessed using exposure interactions with time, as well as Martingale
  residuals. No violations were observed. Quartiles were created for each PUFA exposure
  based on the distributions among the 1463 women with breast cancer included in the
  current study. Although other exposure cutpoints were considered, the shape of the
  dose response between PUFAs and the log-hazard of mortality was best captured with
  quartiles, balancing both parsimony and nonlinearity of the exposure. Similarly,
  quartiles were created for exposures related to fish intake. We conducted linear
  trend tests by modeling the exposure continuously.\n\nIn the Cox proportional hazards
  models, we also considered interactions between total ω-3 and total ω-6 intakes,
  and between the ω-3/ω-6 ratio in association with mortality. For these interaction
  analyses, PUFAs were dichotomized at the median. Interaction was evaluated on the
  additive scale and measured using relative excess risk due to interaction, with
  corresponding 95% CIs calculated using the Hosmer and Lemeshow method. Multiplicative
  interactions were also assessed using the likelihood ratio test; however, the conclusions
  did not change.\n\nEffect modification of the association between PUFA intake and
  mortality by menopausal status, hormone receptor status, dietary supplement use,
  treatment, and body mass index were also examined in the PUFA regression models.
  However, after stratification, little or no heterogeneity was observed for all but
  BMI. In addition, we estimated the direct association between PUFA intake and survival
  while accounting for the potential influence of prediagnostic PUFA intake on tumor
  size using inverse probability weighting.\n\nPotential confounders for the association
  between PUFA intake and mortality were identified using a directed acyclic graph
  and included age, total energy intake, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, family
  history of breast cancer, income, BMI, alcohol use, fruit and vegetable intake,
  physical activity, and race. No adjustment was made for potential intermediates
  of the hypothesized association between PUFA intake and mortality. However, only
  age and total energy intake were found to change the HR estimates by &gt;10%, and
  thus all PUFA mortality regression models were adjusted for these 2 confounders.\n\nWe
  conducted sensitivity analyses to determine whether results varied when restricting
  the cohort to: 1) women with invasive tumors and 2) white individuals. However,
  the restricted sensitivity results did not vary substantially from those based on
  all women, and therefore only the latter are shown.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge,
  the current study is the first to explore interactions between PUFA intake and putatively
  functional genetic polymorphisms involved in multiple biologically relevant pathways.
  Laboratory and statistical methods for these exploratory analyses are described
  in the online Supporting Information.\n\nAll statistical analyses were conducted
  using PROC PHREG and PROC LIFETEST in SAS statistical software.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs shown
  in Table 1, among our population-based sample of women with breast cancer, a baseline
  intake of total ω-3 fatty acids from any dietary source was lower compared with
  ω-6 fatty acid intake. ALA intake was found to be the highest contributor to total
  ω-3 intake, with an average intake of 0.85 g/day, whereas LA was the highest contributor
  to total ω-6 intake, with an average intake of 7.44 g/day. Tuna intake was higher
  compared with shellfish intake. As also shown in Table 1, fish was a primary contributor
  to the high intake of long-chain ω-3 PUFAs, including DPA, DHA, and EPA. In contrast,
  foods that contributed to high ALA intake were biscuits/muffins and other fried
  foods. In addition, a high AA intake appeared to be driven by eggs and meats, including
  fish, chicken, and ham.  \n\n\n\n\nThe Kaplan-Meier curves shown in Figure 1 indicate
  survival was improved among the population-based sample of women with breast cancer
  reporting a higher intake of the long-chain ω-3 fatty acids DPA, DHA, and EPA. As
  presented in Table 2, reductions of 16% to 34% in all-cause mortality were observed
  for a higher intake of long-chain ω-3 fatty acids. Specifically, lower death rates
  were observed for the highest 2 quartiles of intake compared with the lowest quartile
  of DHA, EPA, and DPA. The corresponding HR for the ω-3/ω-6 ratio was modestly decreased
  by 15%, but the 95% CI included the null value. As also shown in Table 2, adjusted
  HRs for all-cause mortality were increased by 14% to 30% for higher intakes of total
  ω-6, LA, AA, and ALA but 95% CIs were wide. Patterns were similar, but less precise,
  for PUFA intake from all dietary sources in relation to breast cancer-specific mortality
  after 15 years of follow-up, and when we considered all-cause mortality after 5-years
  of follow-up.\n\nFigure 1\\. Kaplan-Meier survival curves for dietary intake of
  the long-chain ω-3 fatty acids docosapentaenoic acid, docosahexaenoic acid, and
  eicosapentaenoic acid among a population-based sample of women with breast cancer
  in the Long Island Breast Cancer Study Project, 1996/1997 through 2011. Dotted line
  indicates quartile 1; dashed line, quartile 2; thin line, quartile 3; thick line,
  quartile 4.\n\n\n\nWe also considered an interaction between ω-3 and ω-6 and all-cause
  mortality; however, as shown in Supporting Information Table S2, no interaction
  on an additive scale was observed. Although there was statistical evidence of an
  interaction on a multiplicative scale when considering the association between PUFA
  and all-cause mortality stratified by BMI, there was no consistent pattern observed.
  In addition, the inverse probability estimates for the direct association of PUFA
  and survival accounting for tumor size were similar to the estimates that did not
  account for tumor size.\n\nDespite our novel biologic hypothesis, we observed little
  or no association between select putatively functional genetic polymorphisms involved
  in inflammation, oxidative stress, and estrogen metabolism and all-cause mortality,
  nor did we observe notable interactions between the ω-3/ω-6 ratio and polymorphisms
  in multiple biologic pathways on overall mortality.\n\n\n\nAs shown in Table 4,
  fish intake was associated with a 25% to 34% reduction in all-cause mortality. Specifically,
  lower rates of death were observed for those in the highest quartile of tuna intake
  compared with no intake and the highest 2 quartiles for other fish. There was little
  or no evidence of an association between all-cause mortality and shellfish intake.
  Adjusted estimates for breast cancer-specific mortality demonstrated pronounced
  but imprecise reductions when we considered tuna and other fish in relation to 5
  years of follow-up. However, estimates were closer to the null when we considered
  15 years of follow-up and other baked/broiled fish.  \n\n\n\n\nIn this population-based
  follow-up study of women with breast cancer, we observed reduced hazards of 16%
  to 34% for all-cause mortality after 15 years of follow-up with consumption of higher
  levels compared with the lowest level of long-chain ω-3 fatty acids. Similarly,
  a higher intake of tuna and other baked/broiled fish was associated with a 25% to
  34% decrease in all-cause mortality. As shown in the Supporting Information, we
  found limited evidence of an interaction between ω-3 and ω-6, or between PUFAs and
  most genotypes considered in 3 related pathways.\n\nThe results of the current population-based
  study are consistent with those of a previous study regarding PUFA and/or fish intake
  in relation to survival among women with breast cancer that is relatively comparable
  to our own. Patterson et al examined marine food sources of EPA and DHA in the WHEL
  study, and reported reductions of 28% for disease recurrence and 41% for all-cause
  mortality. The methods for the WHEL study differ from ours in that only marine ω-3
  sources were assessed using repeated 24-hour recalls after varying lengths of time
  since diagnosis among women recruited for a dietary intervention aimed at reducing
  breast cancer recurrence. Whereas we considered marine and other dietary PUFA sources
  that were assessed using a 101-item FFQ administered within 3 months of diagnosis
  to a population-based sample of women who were newly diagnosed with breast cancer.
  The robustness of the results across studies, despite the methodological differences
  between the LIBCSP study and the WHEL study, support the possibility of long-chain
  ω-3 PUFAs as a potential risk reduction strategy for breast cancer survivors, even
  in the presence of potential measurement error. Further research is needed to confirm
  these findings.\n\nThe results reported herein for long-chain ω-3 fatty acids, total
  ω-6, LA, AA, and the ratio of ω-3/ω-6 are consistent with the biologic mechanism
  of a PUFA-induced cytotoxic environment via lipid peroxidation, and the potential
  benefit of this environment on reducing apoptosis and cell growth in cancer cells.
  Long-chain ω-3 fatty acids contain more double bonds within the fatty acid chain
  compared with ALA and ω-6 fatty acids. These double bonds provide additional opportunities
  for lipid peroxidation and thus could help to promote a cytotoxic environment within
  the cell. Consequently, this cytotoxic environment could provide a beneficial environment
  for women with breast cancer.\n\nThe results of the current study for ALA intake,
  which suggest a modest increase in the rate of overall death, are not consistent
  with a biologic hypothesis via inflammatory pathways. This discrepancy may reflect
  the foods that are contributing to high ALA intake in our Long Island population;
  namely, we observed that the foods containing butter and fried foods are contributing
  to high ALA intake. The similarity in foods contributing to high intake for ALA
  and ω-6 fatty acid intake may explain the potentially spurious increased rate of
  overall death observed for a greater intake of ALA. In addition, in vivo conversion
  of ALA into long-chain ω-3 PUFAs is inefficient in populations with high ω-6 intake,
  which may possibly explain the modest increase in the overall rate of death observed
  in the current study.\n\nThis prospective, population-based study has multiple strengths.
  To the best of our knowledge, the current study is the first to examine the potential
  relation between PUFA intake and breast cancer survival, while simultaneously considering
  both ω-3 and ω-6 PUFAs. In addition, we examined multiple ω-3 and ω-6 subtypes in
  relation to all-cause mortality, and therefore our additional assessments complement
  and move beyond what was examined in WHEL, a low-fat dietary intervention for which
  examination of ω-6 PUFAs was not reported. Consideration of nonmarine sources of
  PUFAs may be critical for some United States populations that consume low amounts
  of fish. Furthermore, to our knowledge the current study is the first to explore
  PUFA interactions with genes in multiple genetic pathways using a population-based
  design.\n\nHowever, our follow-up study also has limitations. Despite the relatively
  large sample size, estimates for the associations with breast cancer-specific mortality
  were imprecise for both the 5-year and 15-year follow-up periods, and were less
  pronounced compared with all-cause mortality for the entire 15-year follow-up period
  only. It is possible that long-chain ω-3 intake has the potential to reduce 15-year
  mortality from other outcomes, such as cardiovascular disease mortality, which could
  potentially lead to more pronounced estimates for all-cause compared with breast-cancer
  specific mortality after 15 years of follow-up. Nonetheless, during the first 5
  years after a breast cancer diagnosis, the majority of deaths are due to breast
  cancer. Thus, the results of the current study suggest that ω-3 PUFA intake is associated
  with both all-cause and breast cancer-specific mortality within the first 5 years
  after diagnosis. In addition, we were able to capture dietary intake close to the
  time of diagnosis, and thus this exposure window may be more relevant for the 5-year
  follow period given the more pronounced estimates observed for this time period.
  However, the imprecision for all breast cancer-specific estimates, regardless of
  the time period, is likely due to PUFA measurement error. For example, it is possible
  that a one-time baseline FFQ measurement of diet may not accurately reflect dietary
  intake throughout the 15-year period after diagnosis. One recent study compared
  prediagnosis versus postdiagnosis dietary intake, and reported dietary increases
  in oily fish and fish oil consumption after breast cancer diagnosis. However, this
  repeated measure study enrolled women 9 months to 15 months after diagnosis, and
  asked them to concurrently recall dietary intake 1 year before diagnosis as well
  as changes in diet after diagnosis; therefore, the reported changes in dietary intake
  are subject to errors in recall. Nonetheless, it is possible that the estimates
  of long-chain ω-3 PUFA intake in the current study population are conservative.
  Furthermore, long-chain ω-3 PUFA levels differ by fish species, with tuna being
  among the highest. Thus, future, larger studies should consider repeated PUFA measurements
  throughout follow-up to enhance our examination of the potential association between
  long-chain ω-3 PUFAs and survival in patients with breast cancer.\n\nIn addition,
  although the current study is population-based and reflects the racial distribution
  of the target population on Long Island, which improves study validity, the LIBCSP
  population includes predominantly white women and therefore examination of racial
  differences was not possible. However, the current study results are generalizable
  to white women, for whom the rates of breast cancer remain high. Future studies
  may consider exploring possible heterogeneity between PUFA and survival by race,
  or by breast cancer tumor subtypes.\n\nIn the current population-based follow-up
  study of women with breast cancer on Long Island, New York, we observed reductions
  of 16% to 34% in all-cause mortality after 15 years of follow-up for a high intake
  of fish and long-chain ω-3 PUFAs, which is consistent with laboratory evidence and
  what to the best of our knowledge is the one other United States-based epidemiologic
  study considering this issue. Thus, pending additional replication, dietary intake
  of fish and other sources of long-chain ω-3 fatty acids may provide an additional
  strategy with which to improve survival after breast cancer.\n\n\n\nSupported in
