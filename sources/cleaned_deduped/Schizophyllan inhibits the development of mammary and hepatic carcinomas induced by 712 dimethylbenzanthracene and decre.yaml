  inhibits the development of mammary and hepatic carcinomas induced by 712 dimethylbenzanthracene
  and decre.md
text: "\n\nBreast cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer mortality among women.
  Some anticancer compounds have been isolated from mushrooms. The aim of the present
  work was to study the anticancer effects of schizophyllan, a -d-glucan extracted
  from the mushroom Schizophyllum commune alone or in combination with tamoxifen  on
  7, 12 Dimethylbenzanthracene -induced carcinomas in mice.\n\nWe isolated SCH from
  S. commune. Female mice received DMBA, SCH, DMBA+SCH, DMBA+TAM or DMBA+TAM+SCH or
  vehicles. We studied mice survival, tumour incidence, histopathology, oestrogen
  receptor  expression, cell proliferation by immunohistochemical detection of proliferating
  cell nuclear antigen, apoptosis by TUNEL assay, as well as caspase-3 expression.\n\nDMBA
  treatment resulted in mammary and hepatocellular carcinomas. Both SCH and TAM reduced
  the incidence of DMBA-induced mammary tumours by 85 and 75 %, respectively, and
  equally decreased the PCNA labelling index relative to DMBA. TAM treatment increased
  the incidence of- and PCNA index in HCCs relative to DMBA, while SCH suppressed
  these effects. TAM was more effective than SCH in the induction of apoptosis in
  both mammary and hepatic carcinomas. Caspase-3 levels correlated with the apoptotic
  index in most experimental groups.\n\nOnly one dose of SCH had similar therapeutic
  effects against DMBA-induced mammary carcinomas as 4 weeks of TAM treatment. This
  coupled with the ability of SCH to suppress hepatic lesions associated with TAM
  treatment provides the rationale for further investigating the combined therapeutic
  effects of TAM+SCH in preclinical models of ER-positive breast cancer, as well as
  in liver cancer.\n\nThe online version of this article  contains supplementary material,
  which is available to authorized users.\n\nMushroom Schizophyllum commune Breast

  Caspase-3\n\nBreast cancer is the most common malignancy among women and is still
  today one of the leading causes of cancer mortality despite the development of improved
  diagnostic tools and novel therapeutic modalities. Treatment options for breast
  cancer patients include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy and targeting therapies,
  such as drugs targeting the oestrogen receptor, epidermal growth factor signalling
  pathway and a number of other kinases. Tamoxifen  is widely used as a first-line
  endocrine therapy for breast cancer patients with positive ER and as a chemoprophylactic
  agent for women at high risk of developing this disease. Besides the significant
  benefit, long-term administration of TAM has serious adverse effects; including
  endometrial cancer in women. Therefore, alternative therapies with minimal side
  effects are required. Several anticancer compounds have been isolated from herbs
  or fungi such as mushrooms. In general, medicinal mushrooms have been shown to improve
  cardiovascular health, stimulate immune function and contribute to glucose homoeostasis
  and to modulate detoxification, as well as exert antiallergic, antiviral, antibacterial,
  antifungal and anti-inflammatory activities. In addition, polysaccharides from mushrooms
  have exhibited anticancer activities. The bioactive polysaccharides isolated from
  mushroom fruit bodies, submerged cultured fungal biomass, or liquid culture fermentation
  broths are either -d-glucans or -d-glucanprotein complexes. A small number have
  progressed to clinical trials mainly in Japan and China such as lentinan, schizophyllan,
  PSK and PSP  and Grifron-D. In almost all cases, the polysaccharides are used as
  adjuvant treatments with conventional chemotherapy/radiotherapy with many forms
  of cancer. Their incorporation into treatment regimens significantly reduced the
  side effects so often encountered by patients. Although the exact molecular mechanism
  of their antitumour action is still not fully known, these polysaccharides are suggested
  to enhance the immune responses in vivo and act as biological response modifiers.\n\nSCH
  from the inedible mushroom S. commune, known as split-gill mushroom, is a highly
  potent antitumour polysaccharide that inhibits solid Sarcoma 180 tumour when injected
  by intraperitoneal or intravenous route, but has low antitumour activity by subcutaneous
  route. In humans, it was found ineffective against gastric cancer, but extended
  survival in patients with head and neck cancer.\n\nTo our knowledge, the efficacy
  of SCH in the treatment for breast cancer has not been studied before; hence, the
  present work was conducted to study the potential anticancer effect of SCH alone
  or in combination with TAM on 7, 12 Dimethylbenzanthracene -induced carcinogenesis
  in mice. DMBA-treated mice developed both mammary- and hepatocellular carcinomas.
  An imbalance between proliferation and apoptosis may lead to tumourigenesis. Therefore,
  in the present study, we investigated the effect of SCH on the incidence of both
  mammary and hepatic tumours, on the levels of proliferating cell nuclear antigen
  \ as a marker of cell proliferation, on apoptosis, as well as on the expression
  of caspase-3, a central protein in the execution of apoptosis. In the current study,
  both SCH and TAM alone or in combination decreased mammary tumour incidence through
  reducing cell proliferation; however, TAM was more effective than SCH in the induction
  of apoptosis, which was coupled with an increase in caspase-3 levels. Interestingly,
  TAM increased the HCC incidence in DMBA+TAM-treated mice in comparison with DMBA-treated
  mice and this was associated with an increase in PCNA labelling index in HCCs. In
  contrast, SCH reduced the incidence of HCCs in DMBA+SCH- and DMBA+TAM+SCH-treated
  mice, which was accompanied by a reduction in cellular proliferation. In addition,
  SCH increased the percentage of apoptotic cells and the levels of caspase-3 expression
  in HCCs from DMBA- or DMBA+TAM-treated mice but not in normal liver.\n\nSchizophyllum
  commune was collected from a local forest in La Crosse, Wisconsin, USA, and maintained
  in culture. Slants were incubated at 28 C for 4 days and stored at 5 C. Petri dishes
  were inoculated with 1 cm of mycelia from slants at room temperature. The culture
  was grown on potato dextrose agar slants at 28  2 C for 7 days. A 1 cm2 of mycelia
  along with agar from such slants were used to inoculate 50 ml of sterile seed culture
  medium, which was incubated at 28  2 C for 3 days on a rotary shaker. Polysaccharides
  were extracted by fermentation. S. commune was screened for SCH production using
  the media reported by. Based on the initial screening, S. commune was selected for
  further studies. The extraction and purification of polysaccharides from mushroom
  fruit bodies and mycelia were carried out according to the method of. Briefly, fresh
  mushroom fruit bodies or mycelia  were washed with water and boiled in 5 L of distilled
  water for 815 h. The suspension was then centrifuged to remove the insoluble matter.
  The aqueous extract was concentrated under reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator
  to the point where a slight turbidity was observed. The polysaccharide was obtained
  by precipitation with an equal volume of absolute ethanol. The fibrous like precipitate
  was left overnight at 4 C, collected by centrifugation, washed with absolute ethanol,
  freeze-dried and then weighed.\n\nUltraviolet and infrared absorptions were determined
  according to the methods described by. The H and C nuclear magnetic resonance  spectroscopy
  was performed according to the method described by  in which the polysaccharide
  sample  was dissolved in one millilitre of concentrated dimethylsulfoxide  by ultrasonication
  for 1015 min. The solution was then introduced into a precision ground tube  and
  measured. NMR spectra were obtained using a 500 MHz JEOL spectrometer.\n\nFemale
  adult swiss albino mice  with a mean weight of 25 g at the beginning of the experiment
  were obtained from the animal house at the Faculty of Medicine. Principles of laboratory
  animal care NIH publication Np. 85-23, revised 1985 were followed, as well as the
  guidelines of animal experiments of Alexandria Universitys research ethics committee.
  Five animals were housed per cage and kept on standard diet  and water ad libitum,
  22 C RT, 50  10 % humidity and 12-h light/dark cycle. The animals were divided into
  six groups, each containing 20 mice. Neoplastic mammary lesions were induced in
  mice by administering DMBA   once/week for 4 weeks in 0.1 mL of sesame oil using
  oral gavage. Mice were divided into the following groups as shown in Fig. 1: Group
  1 received only DMBA and group 2 received only SCH  in saline once at the beginning
  of the experiment. Group 3 was divided into two subgroups: group 3a received both
  DMBA and SCH at the beginning of the experiment and group 3b was treated first with
  DMBA as in group 1; then, after the appearance of palpable tumours, they received
  one dose of SCH. Group 4 received TAM   in 0.1 mL sesame oil per oral  for 4 weeks
  after the appearance of tumours. Group 5 received both TAM+SCH after the appearance
  of tumours. Group 6 was divided into two subgroups, which received vehicles  to
  serve as negative controls for SCH  and DMBA or TAM, respectively.\n\nExperimental
  groups mice were divided into six groups: group 1 was treated with DMBA at a dose
  of 40 mg/kg once/week for 4 weeks in 0.1 mL of sesame oil using oral gavage, group
  2 was injected intraperitoneal with SCH at a dose of 4 mg/kg only once at the beginning
  of the experiment. Group 3 was divided into two subgroups: group 3a received both
  DMBA and SCH at the beginning of the experiment and group 3b was treated first with
  DMBA as in group 1 then after the appearance of palpable tumours mice received one
  dose of SCH. Group 4 received both DMBA as in group 1 and TAM at a dose of 8 mg/kg/day
  in 0.1 mL sesame oil per oral for 4 weeks, group 5 received DMBA+TAM+SCH, while
  group 6 was divided into two subgroups, which received saline  and sesame oil. All
  the animals were killed after 20 weeks from the first DMBA dose\n\nUpon necroscopy,
  mammary and liver tissues and tumours were removed and immediately sliced and fixed
  in 10 % neutral buffered formalin. The tissues were processed, embedded in paraffin
  and sectioned at 5 m thickness. The sections were mounted on glass slides and stained
  with haematoxylin and eosin  for histopathological evaluation.\n\nDetection of apoptotic
  cells in tissue sections was performed using the Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase
  -mediated d-UTP Nick End Labelling  assay  according to the manufacturers protocol.
  The number of apoptotic cells was measured according to the number of positive cells
  as well as by morphologic assessment. The apoptotic index was calculated as the
  number of positive cells/total number of positive and negative cells 100 in five
  different fields per section.\n\nFor immunohistochemical analysis, formalin-fixed
  tissue sections were mounted onto coated slides and rehydrated. Antigen retrieval
  was performed by boiling the slides in 2 mg/L citrate buffer. The slides were then
  left to cool to RT, and sections were washed in phosphate-buffered saline  and left
  to equilibrate. Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by incubating the sections
  in 3 % solution of H2O2 in PBS for 10 min. After washing 3 times in PBS, nonspecific
  reactivity was blocked by incubation with protein blocker for 5 min. The sections
  were then incubated with the following monoclonal antibodies: against PCNA, against
  caspase-3  Ab-3   and against ER   overnight at 4 C. Sections were then left at
  RT for 1 h after which they were incubated with the secondary antibody for 30 min
  at RT. The UltraVision ONE detection system with horseradish peroxidase  Polymer
  and DAB Plus Chromogen  was used, and sections were counterstained with haematoxylin,
  mounted and examined. For the verification of the specificity of the immunostaining,
  the primary antibodies were substituted with their diluting solution on some sections
  to serve as negative controls. Scoring was performed according to. For quantitative
  analysis of the PCNA or caspase-3 positivity, we measured PCNA or caspase-3/Labelling
  index  as follows: at least 6 fields per section were photographed. Positive and
  negative cells were counted in each field. We calculated PCNA/LI or caspase-3/LI
  as the number of positive cells/total number of positive and negative cells.\n\nData
  were analysed and expressed as means  SD. Statistical analysis was performed using
  the SPSS statistical package version 16.00. The differences between groups were
  analysed using one-way analysis of variance  followed by Fisher Least Significant
  Difference  test. The KruskalWallis test was used for nonparametric data, and the
  MannWhitney test was then used for intergroup comparisons. A p value  0.05 was considered
  significant.\n\nIn the present study, polysaccharides  were extracted and purified
  from S. commune. The primary structure of the extracted substance identified using
  different spectroscopic techniques was found to be -glucan. The 1H NMR spectra exhibited
  signals at different resonance, which represented the -anomeric proton and protons
  of the different hydroxyl groups. The 13C NMR spectrum revealed signals that are
  characteristic to glucan; the presence of 6 carbon atoms.\n\nIn the present study,
  while SCH was found to significantly increase mices survival in comparison with
  control mice receiving vehicle, it did not significantly alter the survival of mice,
  which received DMBA or DMBA and TAM, that is, those harbouring tumours. On the other
  hand, DMBA alone or DMBA+TAM or DMBA+TAM+SCH decreased the survival of mice significantly
  in comparison with control mice receiving vehicle  at p ; 0.000.\n\nEffect of schizophyllan
  on mice survival SCH significantly increased mices survival in comparison with control
  mice receiving vehicle  ; however, it did not significantly alter the survival of
  mice receiving DMBA or DMBA and TAM. Treatment of mice either with DMBA alone, DMBA+SCH,
  DMBA+TAM or DMBA+TAM+SCH decreased animals survival significantly in comparison
  with control and SCH-treated animals. SCHa: mice treated with SCH at the same time
  as DMBA, SCHb: mice treated with SCH after the appearance of palpable tumours\n\nTo
  evaluate the anticancer potential of SCH in vivo, we first induced mammary tumours
  in female mice using DMBA. Beginning 4 weeks after the last DMBA dose, mice began
  to develop palpable tumours. We euthanized mice whenever they showed signs of morbidity
  or when found dead. After 20 weeks from the beginning of DMBA treatment, we euthanized
  the remaining mice for analysis. While 75 % of DMBA-treated mice developed mammary
  tumours, administration of SCH alone before  or after  the induction of mammary
  tumours by DMBA resulted in substantial reduction in tumour incidence. Since SCH
  had the same effect on tumour incidence whether administered before or after the
  appearance of tumours, we, herewith, refer to subgroups 3a and 3b collectively as.
  Treatment with TAM alone was found to reduce the tumour incidence to 25 %. Combining
  SCH with TAM was found to further decrease the mammary tumour incidence to 15 %
  \ in comparison with TAM alone. SCH-treated mice  did not develop any tumours similar
  to the control mice, which received vehicle only.\n\nMammary tumour incidence and
  histopathology  neither the control nor the SCH-treated mice developed any mammary
  tumours, whereas 75 % of DMBA-treated mice developed mammary tumours. TAM alone
  reduced the mammary tumour incidence in DMBA-treated mice to 25 %, while TAM in
  combination with SCH or SCH alone further decreased the mammary tumour incidence
  to 15 %. b Section of control mouse mammary gland showing normal tissue architecture

  with H&amp;E and h is stained with an antibody against ER\n\nIn the present study,
  no pathological changes were detected either in mammary tissue of control or in
  SCH-treated mice. Treatment with DMBA resulted in varying degrees of epithelial
  hyperplastic changes ranging from mild to atypical changes including ductal carcinoma
  in situ, lobular carcinoma in situ  and infiltrating ductal carcinoma. Mammary glands
  from mice treated with DMBA+SCH or with DMBA+TAM+SCH still showed epithelial hyperplastic
  changes such as atypical ductal hyperplasia  and DCIS. In the DMBA+TAM-treated group,
  similar pathological changes to those induced by DMBA including IDC  were detected.
  All mammary tumours induced by DMBA were ER-positive. A representative section of
  DMBA-treated mouse mammary gland immunostained with ER and its negative control
  are shown in, respectively.\n\nWe next studied the effect of SCH and TAM on cellular
  proliferation by immunostaining of PCNA in the mammary glands of control and treated
  mice. In control and SCH-treated mice, PCNA was localized in the ductal epithelial
  cell nuclei. The localization and intensity of the signal were similar in both control
  and SCH-treated mice. The mammary tumours from all the DMBA-treated groups showed
  a significant increase in the number of PCNA-positive cells. Representative sections
  from the mammary tumours induced in DMBA+TAM and DMBA+TAM+SCH-treated mice are shown
  in. The PCNA signal was localized in the tumour cells in addition to the ductal
  epithelial cells as shown in a section of the high-grade ductal carcinoma from a
  DMBA+TAM+SCH-treated mouse shown in. The number of PCNA-positive cells was counted
  in the mammary glands of all groups in six different fields, and the PCNA labelling
  index  was calculated as described in the Materials and methods. The results are
  presented in. Treatment with DMBA significantly increased the PCNA/L1 score to about
  8.4-fold of that of control animals. In contrast, SCH did not have a significant
  effect on the PCNA signal in comparison with control mice. However, treatment with
  either SCH alone or TAM alone or in combination significantly reduced the PCNA/L1
  values by approximately 60 % in all treated groups  in comparison with the DMBA-treated
  group.\n\nSchizophyllan and tamoxifen reduce cell proliferation in DMBA-induced

  Data are expressed as mean  standard deviation. DMBA treatment resulted in increasing
  the PCNA LI by 8.4-fold in comparison with control and to SCH. Treatment of mice
  bearing DMBA-initiated tumours with either SCH or TAM individually or in combination
  resulted in reduction in the PCNA LI by an average of 6070 %\n\nPCNA levels are
  expressed as PCNA/LI representing the number of positive cells/number of positive
  and negative cells in six fields and expressed as mean  SD\n\nIn the present work,
  we studied apoptosis in the mammary glands in situ using TUNEL assay. The percentage
  of apoptotic cells was equal in the mammary glands from both normal and SCH-treated
  mice. Treatment of mice with DMBA alone increased the apoptotic index significantly
  by 11.5-fold in comparison with control. Treatment with either DMBA+SCH, DMBA+TAM
  or DMBA+TAM+SCH also significantly increased the apoptotic index by 7.5-, 31-, and
  40-fold that of control mice. This indicated that in DMBA+TAM-treated mice, TAM
  increased the apoptotic index significantly by 2.7-fold that induced by DMBA. Interestingly,
  combined treatment of SCH and TAM further increased the apoptotic index by 3.5-fold
  that induced by DMBA. Furthermore, the increase in apoptosis was associated with
  an increase in caspase-3 expression levels in most experimental groups in comparison
  with control.\n\nApoptotic index determined by TUNEL assay in mammary glands from

  tumours with SCH decreased the apoptotic index by 0.35-fold, while TAM and TAM+SCH
  increased apoptosis by 2.7- and 3.5-fold, respectively, in comparison with DMBA\n\nIn
  the present study, liver sections from control or SCH-treated mice showed no pathological
  changes. Mice treated with DMBA developed HCC in addition to the mammary tumours.
  Forty-five per cent of the analysed mice developed HCC  that were well  or poorly
  differentiated. The remaining mice showed varying degrees of pathological changes
  such as foci of small cell dysplastic lesions that were more evident in the periportal
  acinar zone 1. Ductular reaction was also observed.. The administration of TAM to
  DMBA-treated mice increased the severity of hepatic lesions. Fifty-five per cent
  of DMBA+TAM-treated mice developed HCC, mostly were well developed with a trabecular
  pattern and evidence of bile production. Other hepatic lesions induced by TAM included
  centrilobular canalicular cholestasis, steatohepatitis, which was observed in about
  30 % of mice, as well as increasing fibrosis. The mice receiving DMBA+TAM+SCH displayed
  similar histopathological changes as in the DMBA+TAM group such as steatohepatitis,
  small cell dysplastic lesions, cirrhosis  and HCCs; however, these lesions appeared
  less severe and less numerous. HCC was detected in 35 % of the mice in this group.
  Group 3 that received SCH either before or after the appearance of mammary tumours
  still developed HCC and dysplastic foci, but were less numerous than those in the
  DMBA, DMBA+TAM and DMBA+TAM+SCH groups. Dysplastic foci detected in the liver of
  these mice are shown in. HCC was detected in about 30 % of the DMBA+SCH mice. The
  percentage of mice harbouring HCC in the different experimental groups is shown
  in.\n\nHistopathology of the liver  Section of control liver showing the normal

  the control nor the SCH-treated mice developed liver tumours, whereas 45 % of DMBA-treated
  mice developed HCC. TAM alone increased the HCC incidence in DMBA-treated mice to
  55 %, while SCH alone or in combination with TAM decreased the HCC incidence to
  30, and 35 %, respectively\n\nIn the present study, PCNA-positive cells were detected
  in the liver from all control and treated mice. PCNA was localized in the nuclei
  of hepatocytes in normal and SCH-treated mice  and in malignant cells in DMBA-induced
  HCC. The PCNA-positive cells were counted, and the PCNA/LI was determined as described
  in materials and methods and the results are presented in. As in the mammary glands,
  SCH did not induce any changes in the PCNA/LI in comparison with control. In contrast,
  the DMBA-induced HCC displayed a 3.1-fold increase in the number of PCNA/Ll in comparison
  with control liver. Interestingly, TAM had a synergistic effect with DMBA, and tumour
  cells from DMBA+TAM-treated mice had a 5.2-fold increase in PCNA/LI relative to
  the normal cells. HCCs from DMBA+TAM+SCH-treated mice showed a significant reduction
  in the PCNA/LI by 52 % in comparison with the value in DMBA+TAM-treated mice. Similarly,
  when SCH was administered to DMBA-treated mice either before or after the appearance
  of tumours the PCNA/LI decreased significantly by 42 %. The timing of SCH administration
  did not have a statistically significant effect on the PCNA/LI. These results clearly
  indicate that while DMBA and TAM increased cell proliferation, administration of
  SCH significantly reduced this effect.\n\nSchizophyllan reduces and tamoxifen increases

  with control and to SCH. DMBA+SCH-treated mice showed HCC with 40 % lower PCNA LI

  a significant effect on the percentage of apoptotic cells detected by TUNEL assay
  in comparison with normal cells. However, DMBA increased the apoptotic index by
  1.2-fold the value in normal liver. Administration of SCH to DMBA-treated mice increased
  the apoptotic index by 1.2-fold in comparison with that induced by DMBA alone. The
  apoptotic index was further significantly increased in HCCs from DMBA+TAM- or DMBA+TAM+SCH-treated
  mice almost equally, in comparison with that induced by DMBA. This indicates that
  the administration of SCH alone or TAM alone or in combination into DMBA-treated
  mice significantly increased the percentage of apoptotic cells in HCCs. Caspase-3
  levels were also increased in HCCs from DMBA- and DMBA+TAM-treated mice by 1.3-fold
  the value of control and in HCCs from DMBA+SCH or DMBA+TAM+SCH by 2.5-fold the value
  of control.\n\nApoptotic index determined by TUNEL assay in liver from different

  different drug treatments  on the percentage of apoptotic cells determined by TUNEL

  increased the apoptotic index by 1.2-fold in comparison with control. Treatment
  of mice bearing DMBA-initiated tumours with SCH increased the apoptotic index by
  1.2-fold, while TAM and TAM+SCH increased apoptosis by 1.85- and 1.96-fold, respectively,
  in comparison with DMBA. The difference between all the groups was statistically
  significant at p  0.05 except the groups receiving DMBA+TAM and DMBA+TAM+SCH\n\nDietary
  mushroom and extracts from medicinal mushrooms have been shown to possess antitumour
  activities in vitro and in vivo. The effect of the inedible mushroom S. commune
  on mammary cancer in experimental animals has not been published before but a study
  by  reported that dietary intake of fresh mushrooms or dried mushroom powder significantly
  decreased breast cancer in pre- and postmenopausal women. In another study, 69 %
  of breast cancer patients consuming whole maitake mushroom powder showed significant
  cancer regression. In the present study, we demonstrated that schizophyllan, a -d-glucan
  extracted from S. commune, markedly reduced the incidence of mammary and hepatic
  carcinomas and decreased cell proliferation in a mouse model of DMBA-induced carcinogenesis.
  We also compared the antitumour effects of SCH to those of tamoxifen.\n\nIn the
  present study, DMBA induced ER-positive mammary tumours. This is in agreement with
  previous studies showing that DMBA-induced mammary tumours in the rat are essentially
  similar in morphology, pathogenesis and ER status to human breast cancer and show
  oestrogen-dependent growth. In the current work, although mice received only one
  dose of SCH, it was sufficient to reduce the mammary tumour incidence from 75 %
  in DMBA-treated mice to 15 % in the groups that received SCH. The timing of SHC
  administration whether before or after the appearance of tumours did not differ
  significantly regarding its effect on tumour incidence or any other biological effect.
  In comparison, administration of TAM alone  for 4 weeks into DMBA-treated mice reduced
  the mammary tumour incidence to 25 %. This result indicates that one dose of SCH
  was more effective in reducing the mammary tumour incidence in this experimental
  model than daily administration of TAM for 4 weeks. In the present study, DMBA induced
  varying degrees of epithelial hyperplastic changes in mammary tissue including both
  infiltrating ductal and lobular carcinoma and ductal carcinoma in situ. Similar
  mammary lesions were detected in mice, which received DMBA+TAM, albeit with lower
  incidence. In contrast, DMBA-treated mice receiving SCH showed no infiltrating carcinomas;
  however, DCIS was detected in these mice. This may indicate that SCH slowed the
  progression of mammary carcinoma as it is known that in more than 50 % of cases,
  DCIS may progress to infiltrating carcinoma. Consistent with these findings, the
  polysaccharide fraction from maitake mushroom was found to hinder metastatic progression,
  reduce the expression of tumour markers and to increase natural killer cell activity
  in all breast cancer patients as reported by. The powerful anticancer effect of
  one dose of SCH may be attributed to a long biological half-life of the compound.
  Consistent with this explanation,  reported high plasma concentration of -d-glucan
  in a 69-year-old woman 18 years after she was treated with SCH  for cervical cancer.
  SPG has been used in combination with radiotherapy to improve the local response
  to radiation treatment for cervical cancer. In rats, SPG in the liver is degraded
  over a period of 6 months to SPG-like substances and it is metabolized in the spleen
  and mesenteric lymph nodes at a much slower rate, before it is finally excreted
  in the urine. In humans, SPG could be detected in the body after almost 4 years
  from the last intramuscular injection. Although the biological half-life of -d-glucan
  remains unknown in humans, these reports suggest a long half-life for SCH.\n\nIn
  the present study, SCH did not affect the survival of DMBA-treated mice but it significantly
  improved the survival of mice, which received SCH alone in comparison with control
  mice receiving vehicle, and it did not induce any pathological alterations in the
  mammary gland or liver. This is in agreement with a phase I study for the assessment
  of safety and tolerability of a soluble form of oral -glucans. -glucans were given
  in different doses for 4 consecutive days, and no drug-related adverse effects were
  observed. In agreement with our finding,  reported that the median survival time
  of 130 patients with resectable gastric cancer after 5 years of surgical removal
  of the whole tumour tissue in addition to the application of SCH, mitomycin and
  futraful was 72.2 % in comparison with 61.9 % for 134 patients who received chemotherapy
  alone without SCH. However, SCH had no effect on the survival time when the tumour
  tissue could not be totally removed. In cervical cancer, SCH prolonged survival
  and time to recurrence for stage II but not stage III cases  and showed added effectiveness
  when injected directly into the tumour mass. In a randomized trial, SPG combined
  with conventional chemotherapy improved the long-term survival rate of patients
  with ovarian cancer.\n\nIn the present study, although TAM reduced the incidence
  of DMBA-induced mammary tumours, mice receiving DMBA+TAM developed a higher percentage
  of HCC in comparison with those which received DMBA only. Our results are in agreement
  with previous findings that presented TAM as a potent hepatocarcinogen in rats  with
  both tumour-initiating  and promoting properties. Furthermore, TAM was found to
  promote mammary cancer development in a mouse model of Brca 1-mutation-related breast
  cancer. In humans, several side effects of TAM have been reported. In a Swedish
  trial using adjuvant TAM 40 mg/day for 25 years, 3 cases of liver cancer have been
  reported and one case was reported in the Breast Cancer Prevention Trial. The NSABP
  P-1 was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled 5 years of Tamoxifen citrate
  therapy. In the present study, TAM induced additional liver lesions such as steatohepatitis,
  cholestasis and cirrhosis. These results are consistent with previous studies in
  humans reporting the incidence of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis in female patients
  who received TAM   or 40 mg/day as postoperative endocrine treatment. In the current
  study, SCH could reduce the incidence of HCC in DMBA-treated mice from 45 to 30
  % and in DMBA+TAM-treated mice from 55 to 35 %. As discussed below, the reduction
  in HCC incidence was associated with a significant reduction in PCNA labelling index
  and a slight but statistically significant increase in the apoptotic index coupled
  with an increase in the levels of caspase-3 protein. Therefore, the protective effect
  of SCH against TAM-induced or promoted liver lesions warrants further investigation.\n\nOur
  results demonstrated that both TAM and SCH equally decreased cell proliferation
  in mammary tumours. In agreement with our results,  reported that maitake, crimini,
  portabella, oyster and white button mushrooms significantly suppressed cellular
  proliferation with only maitake further inducing apoptosis in MCF-7 breast cancer
  cells. The inhibition of proliferation of ER-positive cells by TAM is already known
  and is attributed to the antagonism of ER by TAM and the subsequent inhibition of
  oestrogen-dependent proliferative events leading to growth arrest of ER-positive
  cells. Our findings are, therefore, consistent with several previous reports. For
  example, de Sousa et al.  demonstrated that TAM reduced the proliferation marker
  Ki-67 positivity in the breast epithelium of carcinoma patients treated with 10
  mg TAM for 14 days. Earlier studies on cell lines revealed that TAM inhibits proliferation
  of MCF-7 human breast cancer cells through a delay in G1 phase.\n\nFurthermore,
  in the present study, while SCH decreased cell proliferation in HCCs, TAM increased
  it significantly in DMBA+TAM-treated mice in comparison with DMBA and combined treatment
  with SCH and TAM reduced the PCNA/LI by 50 % in comparison with that in mice treated
  with only TAM. Similar to our results, polysaccharides from Lentinus edodes suppressed
  liver tumour growth in mice. The increase in cell proliferation by TAM may be attributed
  to the potential increase in gene expression of cell cycle genes such as Ccnd1 as
  was previously reported to be induced by TAM in early stages of liver carcinogenesis.
  Another study reported that the increase in cell proliferation in liver cells by
  TAM could be attributed to epigenetic reprogramming and prominent increase in the
  expression of the c-myc proto-oncogene in female rats exposed to TAM. In the same
  study, the authors also reported that TAM induced apoptosis in hepatocytes as indicated
  by a doubling of the number of TUNEL-positive cells. This is consistent with our
  results.\n\nIn the present study, DMBA induced apoptosis in both mammary and liver
  tumours, but more significantly in mammary tumours. DMBA-induced apoptosis was associated
  with an increase in caspase-3 positivity. Similar to our findings, Tsai-turton et
  al.  showed that DMBA induced apoptosis in preovulatory follicles, which was mediated
  by reactive oxygen species and involved Bax and caspase-3. In further agreement
  with our results, earlier studies showed that DMBA induced apoptosis in the A20.1
  murine B cell lymphoma, and in the adrenal cortex of female SpragueDawley rats,
  which was also associated with activation of caspase-3. In the present study, TAM
  was generally more effective than SCH in the induction of apoptosis in both mammary
  and liver carcinomas, but combined treatment with DMBA+TAM+SCH increased the percentage
  of apoptotic cells in mammary carcinomas in comparison with that induced by DMBA+TAM
  alone. This may explain the reduced mammary tumour incidence in DMBA+TAM+SCH-treated
  mice  versus that in DMBA+TAM-treated mice. In the present study, the caspase-3
  labelling index correlated with the apoptosis index in both mammary and liver tissues
  in the control, DMBA-, SCH- and DMBA+SCH-treated mice. Previous studies demonstrated
  that the water extract of Chaga mushroom  induced apoptosis associated with an upregulation
  of caspase-3 in HT-29 colon cancer cells, and in melanoma cells in vitro and in
  vivo. In the mammary but not the liver tumours, caspase-3 positivity also correlated
  with the increase in apoptosis by DMBA+TAM. In partial agreement with our results,
  TAM has been shown before to induce apoptosis in breast cancer cells, which was
  through the downregulation of bcl-2 without alterations in p53 levels. TAM has also
  been reported to induce apoptosis in HepG2, Hep1B, Hepa1-6 and MH1C1 hepatoma cells,
  which was accompanied with an upregulation of caspase 3 and 8 activity, and increased
  p27, bax, caspase 3 expression. In the present study, TAM did not increase caspase-3
  expression in HCCs but it did in mammary tumours. This may be attributed to the
  fact that there are two pathways that are responsible for TAM-induced apoptosis,
  one is ER-dependent, caspase-independent and resembles necrosis-like programmed
  cell death and the other is ER-independent and caspase-dependent. In our experimental
  setting, the exact mechanism of TAM-induced apoptosis in liver versus mammary tumours
  requires further investigation.\n\nIn spite of the use of mushrooms in clinical
  trials for cancer patients, particularly in the Far East, the molecular mechanism
  of their anticancer activity is still not fully understood. Two mechanisms have
  been proposed to be responsible for the anticancer action of herbs including mushroom;
  one via direct cytotoxic effect and the other is indirectly through immunomodulatory
  action. It has been reported that polysaccharides from mushrooms are able to stimulate
  the nonspecific immune system and to exert antitumour activity through the stimulation
  of the hosts defence mechanism. The drugs activate effector cells like macrophages,
  T lymphocytes and NK cells to secrete cytokines like TNF-, IFN-, IL-1, which are
  antiproliferative and induce apoptosis and differentiation in tumour cells. It remains
  to be elucidated whether the inhibition of mammary tumour development by SCH is
  associated with a hormone effect.\n\nIn conclusion, given the safety level of schizophyllan
  and its relative low cost, as well as its ability to inhibit mammary carcinomas
  similar to tamoxifen, and to suppress liver lesions associated with tamoxifen treatment,
  the present study provides the rationale for the use of schizophyllan in combination
  with tamoxifen in preclinical models and probably in clinical trials for oestrogen
  receptor-positive breast cancer therapy. The potential therapeutic value and mechanism
  of action of SCH deserve further investigation into other types of cancer including
  liver cancer.\n\nThe present study was supported by the Swedish Research Links  to
