  Background/Aim: Triple-negative breast cancer is most the aggressive type of breast
  cancer and is poorly responsive to endocrine therapeutics; however, one of the most
  attractive treatments is tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand-based
  therapies. To identify compounds that enhance the efficacy of TRAIL-based therapies,
  we screened 55 compounds from natural products in combination with TRAIL in TNBC
  cells. Materials and Methods: Human TNBC cells, MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-231, and murine
  TNBC cells, 4T1, were used. Cell viability, apoptotic cells, and cell cycle were
  quantified by the WST-1 assay, annexin-V/7-amino-actinomycinD staining and Propidium
  iodide staining, respectively. In vivo effects of piperine were evaluated in the
  orthotopic-inoculated 4T1-luc mouse model. Results: After screening, we identified
  piperine as the most potent adjuvant at enhancing the efficacy of TRAIL-based therapies
  in TNBC cells in vitro and in vivo, which might be mediated through inhibition of
  survivin and p65 phosphorylation. Conclusion: Piperine may enhance TRAIL-based therapeutics
  for TNBC. '
