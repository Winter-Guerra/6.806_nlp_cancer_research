  Angiogenesis is the process of new blood vessel formation, regulated by a number
  of pro- and anti-angiogenic factors and usually begins in response to hypoxia. Exogenous
  administration of melatonin has been shown numerous anti-tumor effects and appears
  to inhibit tumor angiogenesis. However, many factors involved in the anti-angiogenic
  effect of melatonin are still under investigation. Here, we evaluated the effects
  of melatonin on cell viability and expression of angiogenic factors in MCF-7 and
  MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells under hypoxic conditions. Cell viability was investigated
  by MTT and gene and protein expression of the hypoxia-inducible factor-1α and vascular
  endothelial growth factor were verified by qPCR and immunocytochemistry after melatonin
  treatment under hypoxic conditions. Additionally, a protein array with 20 different
  cytokines/factors was performed on tumor cell lysates. The results showed that 1
  mM of melatonin reduced the viability of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. This treatment
  also decreased the both gene and protein expression of HIF-1α and VEGF-A under hypoxic
  conditions. Among the proteins evaluated by protein array, melatonin treatment during
  hypoxia reduced VEGF-C, VEGFR receptors, matrix metalloproteinase 9 and Angiogenin
  in MCF-7 cells. In MDA-MB-231 cells, a significant decrease was observed in VEGFR2,
  epidermal growth factor receptor and Angiogenin. Taken together, these results showed
  that melatonin acts in the regulation of angiogenic factors in breast tumor cells
  and suggests an anti-angiogenic activity, particularly under hypoxic conditions.'
