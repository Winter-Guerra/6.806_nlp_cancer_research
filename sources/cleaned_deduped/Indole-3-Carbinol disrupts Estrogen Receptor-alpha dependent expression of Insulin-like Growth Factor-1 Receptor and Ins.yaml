  We previously established that Indole-3-Carbinol, a natural hydrolysis product of
  glucobrassicin in cruciferous vegetables, arrests the proliferation of estrogen-dependent
  human breast cancer cells and induces protein degradation of Estrogen Receptor-alpha.
  We demonstrate in human MCF-7 breast cancer cells that I3C ablates expression of
  Insulin-like Growth Factor Receptor-1  and Insulin Receptor Substrate-1, downstream
  effectors of the IGF1 signaling pathway. Exogenous ER reversed the I3C mediated
  loss of IGF1R and IRS1 gene expression demonstrating that down-regulation of ER
  is functionally linked to I3C control of IGF1R and IRS1 expression. I3C disrupted
  binding of endogenous ER, but not Sp1, to ERE-Sp1 composite elements within the
  IGF1R/IRS1 promoters. Exogenous ER abrogated, and combined expression of IGF1R and
  IRS1 attenuated, the I3C mediated cell cycle arrest. Therefore, I3C inhibits proliferation
  of estrogen-sensitive breast cancer cells through disruption of ER-mediated transcription
  of cell signaling components within the IGF1 cascade.'
