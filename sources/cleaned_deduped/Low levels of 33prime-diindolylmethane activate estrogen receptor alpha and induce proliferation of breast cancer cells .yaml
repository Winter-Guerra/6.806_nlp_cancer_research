  levels of 33prime-diindolylmethane activate estrogen receptor alpha and induce proliferation
  of breast cancer cells .md
text: "\n\n3,3-diindolylmethane  is an acid-catalyzed dimer of idole-3-carbinol, a
  phytochemical found in cruciferous vegetables that include broccoli, Brussels sprouts
  and cabbage. DIM is an aryl hydrocarbon receptor  ligand and a potential anticancer
  agent, namely for the treatment of breast cancer. It is also advertised as a compound
  that regulates sex hormone homeostasis. \n\nHere we make use of RNA expression assays
  coupled to Chromatin Immunoprecipitation  in breast cancer cell lines to study the
  effect of DIM on estrogen signaling. We further make use of growth assays, as well
  as fluorescence-activated cell sorting  assays, to monitor cell growth. \n\nIn this
  study, we report that physiologically obtainable concentrations of DIM  activate
  the estrogen receptor   signaling pathway in the human breast cancer cell lines
  MCF7 and T47D, in a 17-estradiol -independent manner. Accordingly, we observe induction
  of ER target genes such as GREB1 and TFF1, and an increase in cellular proliferation
  after treatment with 10 M DIM in the absence of E2. By using an ER specific inhibitor,
  we confirm that the transcriptional and proliferative effects of DIM treatment are
  mediated by ER. We further show that the protein kinase A signaling pathway participates
  in DIM-mediated activation of ER. In contrast, higher concentrations of DIM  have
  an opposite and expected effect on cells, which is to inhibit proliferation. \n\nWe
  document an unexpected effect of DIM on cell proliferation, which is to stimulate
  growth by inducing the ER signaling pathway. Importantly, this proliferative effect
  of DIM happens with potentially physiological concentrations that can be provided
  by the diet or by taking caplet supplements. \n\nBreast cancer is one of the leading
  causes of death in industrialized countries and estrogens are known to play a role
  in its promotion. Initiation of breast cancer by 17-estradiol  can involve the formation
  of DNA damage via its oxidation products. Accordingly, E2 is a substrate for the
  phase I cytochrome P450  enzymes, CYP1A1 and CYP1B1. These two enzymes oxidize E2
  into 2-hydroxyestradiol  and 4-hydroxyestradiol, respectively. The 2-OHE2 metabolites
  can bind estrogen receptor , but do not induce transcriptional activity. On the
  other hand, 4-OHE2 hydroxylation results in the formation of a carcinogenic metabolite
  that can be further oxidized to highly reactive semiquinones and quinines. These
  C-4 metabolites are well characterized and known to produce DNA adducts that lead
  to depurination of DNA. CYP1B1 has been found in high concentrations in many types
  of tumors compared to normal tissues. These observations suggest a function for
  CYP1B1 in promoting tumor growth. To support this hypothesis, the expression of
  CYP1B1 has been observed in mammary tissue many weeks prior to the appearance of
  tumors in DMBA-treated rats. Furthermore, in normal mammary tissue, 2-OHE2-derived
  metabolites are the main conversion products of E2, while a significant increase
  of 4-OHE2-derived metabolites is observed in cancerous mammary tissue. Based on
  these observations, a model has been put forth wherein the CYP1A1/CYP1B1 enzyme
  ratio is essential to control the intracellular level of genotoxic estrogen metabolites.
  \n\nThe CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 genes are expressed primarily in extra-hepatic tissue
  and are regulated by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, a ligand-activated transcription
  factor that belongs to the bHLH/PAS family. AhR ligands are numerous and belong
  to several classes of chemicals including halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons  such
  as 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons  such as
  benzopyrene, and phytochemicals found in cruciferous vegetables like 3,3-diindolylmethane.
  Female rodents exposed to TCDD for two years showed an increase in liver cancer
  incidence but a decrease in spontaneous mammary tumor formation. Later studies revealed
  that TCDD and other AhR ligands inhibit cellular proliferation of human breast cancer
  cell lines,  as well as DMBA-induced mammary tumors in rats, and, consequently,
  these observations highlight a possible functional crosstalk between AhR and ER
  signaling. The potential role of the AhR signaling pathway in mammary carcinogenesis
  inhibition led to the development of selective AhR modulators  that act as potential
  anticancer agents. Even if TCDD possesses chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic proprieties
  in breast cancer development, it also induces acute liver toxicity. SAhRMs, like
  DIM, are reported to have the same inhibitory effects on mammary tumor formation
  in rats without having the deleterious effects of TCDD and other toxic AhR ligands.
  DIM is an acid-catalyzed dimer of indol-3-carbonyl, a compound found in cruciferous
  vegetables such as broccoli, Brussels sprouts and cabbage. DIM is one of the most
  biologically active products examined so far, and because of its potential chemotherapeutic
  functions, it has been extensively studied. Reports showed that DIM treatment induces
  a G1 arrest in the cell cycle of breast, ovarian, prostate, and colon cancer cell
  lines. In addition, DIM also induces apoptosis and p21 expression in a p53-independent
  manner, and is a low affinity ligand for AhR. However, conflicting reports can be
  found in the literature as to whether DIM is an agonist or an antagonist of AhR
  in the expression of the CYP1 family of genes. Furthermore, DIM activates ER in
  a ligand-independent manner, which involves the protein kinase A  and mitogen-activated
  protein kinase  signaling pathways under certain conditions. \n\nAs a natural compound,
  DIM can easily be taken as a dietary supplement. However, information regarding
  heavy DIM supplementation is scarce, and whether or not DIM use is safe on a long-term
  basis is not known. In this study, we compare the effects of two concentrations
  of DIM on the expression of AhR and ER target genes, as well as test their impact
  on AhR-ER crosstalk. We chose a lower concentration of DIM, which can theoretically
  be reached in the human body by a heavy eater of cruciferous vegetables, and a higher
  concentration, which is known to possess strong anti-proliferative effects in cancer
  cells. Our results indicate an opposite dose-dependent effect of DIM in MCF7 and
  T47D cells in the absence of E2. At the high concentration, DIM inhibits cell proliferation
  and induces both p21 and CYP1A1 gene expression. At the low concentration, in the
  absence of E2, DIM acts as an estrogen mimetic and induces ER target gene expression
  and concomitant cellular proliferation. Moreover, we find that the estrogenic effects
  observed following DIM treatment are mediated by ER and the PKA signaling pathway.
  \n\n2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin  was obtained from Cerilliant Cambridge
  isotope Laboratories. 17-Estradiol  and ICI 182,780  were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
  3,3-diindolylmethane  was purchased from LKT Laboratories, Inc., and H89 was purchased
  from Cayman chemical. \n\nMCF7, T47D, and MDAMB-231 cell lines from American Type
  Culture Collection were maintained in DMEM  containing 10% fetal bovine serum  and
  antibiotics. For all the experiments, cells were grown in phenol red free DMEM medium
  \ containing 5% dextran-coated charcoal-treated FBS and antibiotics for three days
  and then treated with different combinations of chemicals. For expression assays,
  we treated the cells for 24 h with 10 nM TCDD, 10 M or 50 M DIM, 100 nM E2. For
  ChIP assays, we treated cells with the same concentrations as described for the
  expression assays, but for 90 min with TCDD and TCDD + E2, and for 60 min with DIM
  and DIM + E2. In experiments with ICI H89, and PD98059, we added these chemicals
  24 h prior to other treatments. \n\nCells were seeded in 6-well plates at a density
  of 0.35  106 cells per well. The day after, the cells were washed twice with PBS
  and put in estrogen-free media for 3 days. The cells were incubated with ligands
  for 24 h. Total RNA was extracted from cells using Genelute. cDNA was synthesized
  from 600 ng of total RNA using MMLV-RT. \n\nThe synthesized cDNA was diluted to
  1:8 and 5 l of the dilution was used per reaction. Quantitative real-time PCR was
  performed using homemade 2X mix with SYBR Green, 2 mM MgCl2, and homemade Taq polymerase.
  We used qPCR primers for 36B4 as the internal control during qPCR. Human CYP1A1,
  CYP1B1, GREB1, TFF1 and p21 mRNAs were quantified with the following primers: RT
  36B4 Fwd-CGACCTGGAAGTCCAACTAC; RT 36B4 Rev-ATCTGCTGCATCTGCTTG; RT CYP1A1 Fwd-TGAACCCCAGGGTACAGAGA;
  RT CYP1A1 Rev-GGCCTCCATATAGGGCAGAT; RT CYP1B1 Fwd-AACGTACCGGCCACTATCAC; RT CYP1B1

  RT p21 Rev-GGATTAGGGCTTCCTCTTGG. \n\nChIP assays were performed essentially as described
  previously. Briefly, cells were crosslinked with 1.1% formaldehyde for 10 minutes
  and then quenched with 125 mM glycine. Samples were sonicated to generate chromatin
  fragments ;500 bp. Next, the chromatin was immunoprecipitated with specific antibodies
  against AhR  and ER. qPCR was performed using a set of primers relevant to the promoter
  regions of the CYP1A1. The primers used in qPCR are ChIP CYP1A1-A Fwd-CAGCACTAAGGCGATCCTAGA;
  ChIP CYP1A1-A Rev-GATTGAAGGATCGGAATGGA. Results are shown as percent of input. \n\nCells
  were seeded in 48-well plates at a density of 1.5  104 cells per well in estrogen-free
  media for three days and then treated with either DMSO; 100 nM E2; 10 M DIM; 50
  M DIM; 50 M ICI; 10 M H89; 10 M DIM and 50 M ICI; or 10 M DIM and 10 M H89. Medium
  was replaced every two days. At each time point, cells were collected, fixed with
  4% formaldehyde for 15 min, and kept in 0.4% formaldehyde/PBS 1X at 4C until the
  last end point was reached. The cells were then washed once with sterile distilled
  water and colored with 0.5 mL of 0.1% crystal violet in 10% ethanol for 20 min.
  The cells were washed three times with sterile distilled water and allowed to air
  dry. The dye was extracted with 0.5 mL of 10% acetic acid for 20 min. Absorbance
  was measured at 590 nm in 96-well plates. The values are presented as fold over
  day 0\\. Each treated time-point is the average of nine wells from three independent
  experiments and the error bars represent standard deviation. \n\nCells were rinsed
  with PBS, treated with trypsin and collected. The cells were then fixed in cold
  70% ethanol, resuspended in 50 mM sodium citrate HCl pH 7.0, and treated successively
  with RNase A and proteinase K. Finally, the cells were resuspended in Sytox Green
  \ dye at a final concentration of 1 M in the same buffer. Samples were analysed
  by flow cytometry on a Becton Dickinson FACScalibur cytometer. For each sample,
  ten thousand cells were plotted on a histogram with FL-1 on the X-axis and gates
  were set to distinguish cells in G1, S, G2/M and sub-G1-phases of the cell cycle.
  Data in the figure are expressed as a percentage of all gated cells in the sample
  and represent the average and standard error of triplicate experiments. \n\nCYP1A1
  expression was first measured in MCF7 breast cancer cells that were grown in estrogen-free
  medium for three days and then treated with either 10 nM TCDD or 50 M DIM, alone,
  or in combination with 100 nM E2 for 24 h. Co-treatment of cells with E2 and TCDD
  typically decreased CYP1A1 activation by 60% when compared to TCDD alone. Following
  DIM treatment, CYP1A1 activity reached levels similar to those found in TCDD + E2
  treated cells. Addition of E2 produced no effect on DIM-induced CYP1A1 expression.
  Similar results were also obtained in T47D cells, but we observed a more modest
  repression effect by E2, as well as weaker activation of CYP1A1. We also monitored
  CYP1A1 protein levels upon TCDD treatment of cells, and, as expected, the observed
  effects on transcription correlated with CYP1A1 protein expression levels. To further
  investigate this phenomenon, we sought to verify the recruitment of AhR and ER at
  the CYP1A1 proximal promoter by ChIP experiments. As expected from the expression
  results, co-treatment of cells with TCDD and E2 impairs AhR binding at the CYP1A1
  promoter as compared to TCDD alone. For the DIM treated cells, we observed no significant
  variation of AhR binding when E2 was added. ER recruitment to the CYP1A1 promoter
  is known to occur only when AhR and ER signaling pathways are simultaneously activated.
  Our results are consistent with this, since ER is present at the CYP1A1 promoter
  only after treatment with TCDD + E2, but not after addition of TCDD alone. Treatment
  of cells with DIM alone, or in combination with E2, resulted in the recruitment
  of both AhR  and ER. This is consistent with the finding that DIM activates both
  AhR and ER signaling pathways. Altogether, these results show that CYP1A1 expression
  and AhR and ER binding at the CYP1A1 promoter are differentially regulated by TCDD
  and DIM. \n\nFigure 1. DIM activates both AhR and ER signaling pathways.  MCF7 cells,

  lysed and RNA was extracted and quantified by RT-qPCR. Results are presented as

  as% of Input and represent the mean of three independent experiments with standard
  deviation. \n\nAdditional file 1: Figure S1.  DIM activates both AhR and ER signaling
  pathways in T47D cells. Cells were grown in estrogen free media for 3 days, then

  E2. After 24 h, the cells were lysed, RNA was extracted and reverse transcribed.
  Results are presented as percent induction over TCDD. Results represent the mean
  of 3 independent experiments with standard deviation.  CYP1A1 protein levels are
  induced by treating cells with 10 M DIM. Immunoblot of CYP1A1 using an anti-CYP1A1
  antibody in T47D cells. Conditions are as described in  using 10 M DIM or DMSO-treated
  cells.\n\nDIM is documented to be a weak AhR ligand when compared to TCDD and has
  been described as an antagonist of AhR-mediated gene transcription. Considering
  the repressive effect of ER on AhR signaling, the activation of ER by DIM treatment
  might partly explain the weaker induction of CYP1A1. This scenario could also explain
  why co-treatment of cells with both TCDD and DIM leads to weaker induction of AhR
  target genes in ER positive cells. We next wanted to verify if depletion of ER would
  allow an increase in CYP1A1 expression after DIM treatment. First, MCF7 cells were
  grown in E2-depleted media for three days and then treated with 50 M ICI 182 780
  \ for 24 h prior to the addition of 50 M DIM for another 24 h. We observed a two-fold
  increase in CYP1A1 induction in cells treated with DIM and ICI compared to DIM alone.
  A similar experiment was performed using T47D breast cancer cells and the results
  obtained  were very comparable to those obtained in Figure 2A. ChIP experiments
  performed at the CYP1A1 promoter using AhR and ER antibodies show that AhR binding
  increases when cells are co-treated with DIM and ICI 182 780, and that ICI 182 780
  prevents ER from being recruited to CYP1A1. The latter result is consistent with
  a previous study that showed that ICI leads to ER degradation. Overall, our data
  indicate a dual role of DIM in the regulation of CYP1A1 expression. On one hand,
  DIM binds AhR and promotes CYP1A1 induction, while on the other, DIM triggers ER
  activation and represses CYP1A1 expression. \n\nFigure 2. ER degradation increasesCYP1A1induction

  media for three days and treated with 50 M ICI 182 780 for 24 h prior to the addition
  of 50 M DIM for 24 h. ChIPs of AhR  and ER  were performed in MCF7 cells, grown
  in estrogen-free media for three days and then treated or not with 50 M ICI 182
  780 for 24 h prior to the addition of 50 M DIM for 1 h. Results are shown as% of
  Input and represent the mean of three independent experiments with standard deviation.
  \n\nAdditional file 2: Figure S2. ER degradation increases CYP1A1 induction in response

  media for 3 days and treated with 50uM ICI 182 780 for 24 h prior addition of 50uM
  DIM for 24 h. Results represent the mean of 3 independent experiments with standard
  deviation.\n\nIn the experiments described above, we used 50 M DIM, which is considered
  to be very high. For instance, Leong and co-workers proposed that a heavy eater
  of Brassica vegetables could reach, under optimal conditions, a DIM blood concentration
  of approximately 10 M. Thus, we decided to compare a potential physiological concentration
  of DIM  with the high concentration. We treated MCF7 cells grown in estrogen-free
  media for three days with the low and the high concentrations of DIM and then measured
  the mRNA levels of two AhR target genes, as well as two ER target genes. We observed
  an increase in gene expression that is directly proportional to DIM concentrations
  for the AhR target genes. Strikingly, the low concentration of DIM strongly induces
  ER target gene expression, whereas the high concentration has almost no effect on
  the expression of these genes. GREB1 protein levels were also monitored by immunoblotting
  using cells treated with 10 M DIM. The results parallel the mRNA expression levels
  and show that GREB1 is induced by 10 M DIM. Taken together, our results suggest
  that physiological concentrations of DIM stimulate transcriptional activity of ER-dependent
  genes in the absence of E2 in MCF7 cells. We also repeated these same experiments
  in T47D cells and obtained nearly identical results, a result that shows that these
  effects are not cell-type specific. \n\nFigure 3. Effects of different concentrations
  of DIM on AhR and ER target gene expression. mRNA levels of AhR target genes CYP1A1
  and CYP1B1 and ER target genes GREB1 and TFF1 were quantified in MCF7 cells grown
  in estrogen-free media for three days, then treated with DMSO, 10 M DIM or 50 M
  DIM for 24 h. Results are shown as fold over DMSO and represent the mean of three
  independent experiments with standard deviation. \n\nAdditional file 3: Figure S3.

  or 50uM DIM for 24 h. Results are showed as fold over DMSO and represent the mean
  of 3 independent experiments with standard deviation.\n\nA previous study using
  reporter assays has shown that the activation of ER by DIM is independent of its
  binding to ER and involves the PKA signaling pathway and, to a lesser extent, the
  MAPK pathway. To test the role of the PKA signaling pathway in ER activation by
  DIM, we used a specific inhibitor of the PKA pathway, H89. We measured mRNA levels
  of CYP1A1, which is negatively regulated by ER, and GREB1, which is positively regulated
  by ER. MCF7 cells grown in E2-depleted media were treated with either 100 nM E2,
  10 M DIM, 10 M DIM + 50 M ICI, or 10 M DIM + 10 M H89 for 24 h. Figure 4A shows
  that both the ICI and H89 treatments of cells abrogate the repression mediated by
  ER on CYP1A1 gene expression. Conversely, we observed that ICI and H89 abolish the
  induction of GREB1 by DIM. As with the previous figures, we performed the same experiments
  in T47D cells and obtained comparable results. In conclusion, DIM mediates ER activation,
  at least in large part, via the action of the PKA signaling pathway. \n\nFigure

  and represent the mean of 3 independent experiments with standard deviation.\n\nIt
  is known that high concentrations of DIM  have antiproliferative and antitumor properties
  in almost all cancer cell lines that have been tested. Moreover, some of these properties
  have been proposed to work via induction of the p21 gene, a key regulator of the
  cell cycle associated with G1 arrest and senescence. Conversely, since a low dose
  of DIM activates ER, it might also promote cellular proliferation. We thus decided
  to compare the effect of both DIM concentrations on cellular proliferation. We first
  verified the effect of high and low-dose DIM treatments on the expression of p21
  by RT-qPCR. We observe that only the high concentration of DIM induces p21 expression
  in MCF7 cells. We then compared MCF7 cell proliferation using crystal violet staining
  in E2-depleted media following three days of treatment with either E2, 10 M DIM
  or 50 M DIM. Strikingly, the two concentrations of DIM have opposite effects on
  cellular proliferation. On the one hand, a low concentration of DIM stimulates cell
  growth almost as much as E2 treatment. On the other hand, a high concentration of
  DIM inhibits cell growth. To verify that the observed effects of the low concentration
  of DIM on cellular proliferation were mediated by ER and the PKA pathway, we treated
  MCF7 cells with either ICI or H89, in addition to DIM. Both the degradation of ER
  and the inhibition of the PKA signaling pathway abrogated the proliferative effect
  of DIM in the absence of E2. Similar experiments were conducted in T47D cells with
  comparable results. \n\nFigure 5. Low concentration of DIM induces MCF7 proliferation

  cell proliferation after DMSO, 100nM E2, 10 M DIM and 50 M DIM treatments.  Effect

  to further confirm the effects of DIM on the cell cycle, we performed cell cycle
  assays using flow cytometry  in T47D cells. The results show that at low concentrations
  of DIM  the percentage of cells in S-phase is significantly increased compared to
  DMSO-treated cells, indicating a higher proliferation rate similar to cells treated
  with E2. Cells treated with 50 M DIM tended to have a lower percentage of S-phase
  cells than untreated cells, although the difference was not statistically significant.
  Finally, we performed a FACS experiment under the same conditions but with MDAMB-232
  cells, which do not express the ER. As expected, DIM has no significant effect  on
  cell growth in this cell line, confirming that the proliferative effect of DIM is
  a result of activating the ER pathway. In conclusion, we observed that treatment
  with the low concentration of DIM induced breast cancer cell proliferation in the
  absence of E2, an effect mediated by ER and the PKA signaling pathway. \n\nAdditional

  inhibitory crosstalk between AhR and ER is very complex and occurs at many regulatory
  levels. AhR ligands have been shown to carry potentially important chemopreventive
  properties, thus understanding the mechanisms behind these properties is fundamental
  for developing cancer therapies. DIM has been intensely studied as a possible therapeutic
  agent in cancer treatment, especially for breast cancer. Studies report that DIM
  treatment promotes cellular growth arrest of cancer cells, as well as a decrease
  in mammary tumor formation in DMBA-treated rats. Although the use of DIM as a therapeutic
  agent in the treatment of breast cancer is not yet approved, there are active clinical
  trials that are testing DIM for the treatment of many types of cancers. However,
  DIM can easily be purchased as a dietary supplement and be self-administered. As
  previously mentioned, DIM is a SAhRM that binds AhR, which is involved in the regulation
  of the expression of phase I and II drug metabolizing enzymes. Discrepancies are
  found in the literature as to whether DIM is an agonist or an antagonist of AhR,
  thus, clarification of this issue is important, especially regarding the potentially
  toxic effect mediated by AhR agonists in the liver following AhR activation. \n\nIn
  this study, we tested how the use of different concentrations of DIM can lead to
  opposite biological outcomes. As previously reported, we confirmed that activation
  of ER by E2 represses the induction of CYP1A1 by approximately 60% after TCDD treatment.
  The simultaneous activation of AhR and ER when cells are treated with DIM does not
  allow full induction of CYP1A1. Furthermore, addition of E2 to DIM-treated cells
  has no repressive effect on CYP1A1 expression, which can be explained by the fact
  that ER is already fully recruited to the CYP1A1 promoter after DIM treatment alone.
  We propose that activation of ER by DIM can explain, at least in part, some discrepancies
  found in the literature on the role of DIM as an agonist/antagonist of AhR in ER
  positive cell lines. \n\nDIM concentrations found in the human body are dependent
  on the diet. Our first experiments were carried out using a concentration of 50
  M, which is probably much higher than what can realistically be reached in the body.
  We then compared 50 M DIM with a more physiological concentration of DIM  and observed
  that the high concentration of the compound induces the expression of AhR target
  genes, while the low concentration shows significant effects on the expression of
  ER target genes  in the absence of E2. These observations indicate that at physiological
  concentrations, DIM principally mediates estrogenic effects. It can also explain
  why oral administration of DIM in rodents has no hepatic toxicity due to the weak
  induction of the CYP1A1 gene at this low concentration. ER activation can be mediated
  by direct binding of its main ligand, but it can also be induced by the activation
  of the PKA signaling pathway. The phosphorylation of ER increases its capacity to
  interact with the transcription machinery and triggers the expression of ER target
  genes. Accordingly, we were able to demonstrate that the effect of DIM treatment
  on CYP1A1 and GREB1 expression is mediated by ER, which, in this case, is activated
  mostly by the PKA signaling pathway. \n\nThe estrogen receptor is highly expressed
  in almost 70% of breast cancer cases and its activation promotes cellular proliferation
  and tumor development. Our results demonstrate that DIM, at concentrations likely
  attainable by a diet rich in cruciferous vegetables, induces proliferation of MCF7
  and T47D breast cancer cells in the absence of E2. DIM requires that ER be activated
  by the PKA signaling pathway to promote cellular growth in the absence of E2. Consequently,
  the abundance of ER, as well as circulating estrogen levels, will influence the
  local effects of DIM on cell growth. Altogether, our findings suggest that the use
  of DIM as a dietary supplement or as a therapeutic agent should be undertaken very
