  Dysregulation of the Hepatocyte growth factor/c-Met signaling axis upregulates diverse
  tumor cell functions, including cell proliferation, survival, scattering and motility,
  epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis.-Oleocanthal
  is a naturally occurring secoiridoid from extra-virgin olive oil, which showed antiproliferative
  and antimigratory activity against different cancer cell lines. The aim of this
  study was to characterize the intracellular mechanisms involved in mediating the
  anticancer effects of-oleocanthal treatment and the potential involvement of c-Met
  receptor signaling components in breast cancer. Results showed that-oleocanthal
  inhibits the growth of human breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231, MCF-7 and BT-474
  while similar treatment doses were found to have no effect on normal human MCF10A
  cell growth. In addition,-oleocanthal treatment caused a dose-dependent inhibition
  of HGF-induced cell migration, invasion and G1/S cell cycle progression in breast
  cancer cell lines. Moreover,-oleocanthal treatment effects were found to be mediated
  via inhibition of HGF-induced c-Met activation and its downstream mitogenic signaling
  pathways. This growth inhibitory effect is associated with blockade of EMT and reduction
  in cellular motility. Further results from in vivo studies showed that-oleocanthal
  treatment suppressed tumor cell growth in an orthotopic model of breast cancer in
  athymic nude mice. Collectively, the findings of this study suggest that-oleocanthal
  is a promising dietary supplement lead with potential for therapeutic use to control
  malignancies with aberrant c-Met activity.

  About 1 in 8 women in the US will develop invasive breast cancer during their lifetime
  . The chance that breast cancer will be responsible for a woman’s death is about
  1 in 36. The American Cancer Society estimated that about 232,340 new cases of invasive
  breast cancer will be diagnosed in women and about 39,620 women will die from breast
  cancer in the US in 2013 despite significant advances in detection and treatment
  . Current chemotherapeutic treatments are usually not completely selective for carcinogenic
  cells and often induce significant cytotoxic effects on normal tissues, resulting
  in a decreased quality of life for cancer patients. Clearly, there is an urgent
  need for the discovery of more effective, selective, more affordable and less toxic
  treatments.


  The c-Met proto-oncogene encodes a heterodimeric receptor tyrosine kinase that consists
  of an extracellular α-chain and a transmembrane β-chain , . Hepatocyte growth factor
  binds to the extracellular domain of c-Met with high affinity and induces receptor
  dimerization with consecutive triggering of c-Met tyrosine kinase activity . This
  is followed by recruitment and phosphorylation of multiple adaptor proteins as well
  as activation of signaling molecules such as phosphoinositide-3-kinase/Akt, mitogen-activated
  protein kinase, breast tumor kinase and phospholipase C-γ pathways –. Akt, MAPK
  and Brk are necessary not only for c-Met-mediated regulation of cell motility, adhesion,
  and invasion, but also for control of cell survival and mitogenesis , , . Currently,
  there is a mounting evidence for the involvement of chronic or dysregulated activation
  of c-Met receptor tyrosine kinase and its ligand HGF in multiple types of tumor
  cells leading to enhancing cell growth, angiogenesis, and survival. In addition,
  aberrant activation of the HGF/c-Met axis is known to promote cytoskeletal changes
  of many cancer cells in favor for migration, invasion, and eventual metastasis.
  Therefore, targeting c-Met activity with small molecule inhibitors of the HGF/c-Met
  axis can be considered a promising approach for cancer treatment and prevention

  It is suggested that the incidence of breast cancer in Mediterranean countries is
  lower than in the US. This may be partly attributed to the Mediterranean dietary
  regimens traditionally known to be rich in extra-virgin olive oil .-Oleocanthal
  is a naturally occurring secoiridoid from EVOO, which showed potent anti-inflammatory
  and neuroprotective activities , . In the past few years, there has been an increasing
  interest in the biological effects of-oleocanthal in inflammation, Alzheimer’s disease
  and cancer –. In addition,-oleocanthal treatment inhibited the proliferation, migration,
  and invasion of various human breast, prostate cancer and multiple myeloma cells
  , , . Moreover, it showed anti-angiogenic activity by downregulating the expression
  of the microvessel density marker CD31 in endothelial colony forming cells . A computer-assisted
  study identified-oleocanthal as a potential c-Met inhibitor hit  which inhibited
  the activation of c-Met kinase in cell-free Z′-LYTE assay , , however, the exact
  antiproliferative, antimigratory, and pro-apoptotic mechanisms of-oleocanthal are
  not well understood. Therefore, the goal of the current study was to characterize
  the intracellular mechanisms involved in mediating the anticancer effects of-oleocanthal
  treatment and the potential involvement of c-Met receptor signaling components in
  breast cancer.






  All materials were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, unless otherwise stated.-Oleocanthal
  was isolated from extra-virgin olive oil. Z-VAD-FMK was purchased from Santa Cruz
  Biotechnology. All antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, unless
  otherwise stated. Antibody for Brk was obtained from Abnova. Antibody for p-Brk
  was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Goat anti-rabbit and goat anti-mouse
  secondary antibodies were purchased from PerkinElmer Biosciences. HGF and epidermal
  growth factor were purchased from PeproTech Inc.,.




  The human breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231, MCF-7 and BT-474 were purchased from
  ATCC. The human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231/GFP was purchased from Cell Biolabs,
  Inc.. The cell lines were maintained in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
  serum, 100 U/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere of
  5% CO2 at 37°C. The MCF10A cell line, an immortalized, non-tumorigenic human mammary
  epithelial cell line, was purchased from ATCC. MCF10A cells were maintained in DMEM/F12
  supplemented with 5% horse serum, 0.5 µg/ml hydrocortisone, 20 ng/ml EGF, 100 U/ml
  penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 10 µg/ml insulin. All cells were maintained
  at 37°C in an environment of 95% air and 5% CO2 in humidified incubator.-Oleocanthal
  and SU11274 were first dissolved in a volume of DMSO to provide a final 25 mM stock
  solution. These stock solutions were then used to prepare various concentrations
  of treatment media. Final concentration of DMSO was maintained as the same in all
  treatment groups within a given experiment and never exceeded 0.1%. SU11274 is a
  selective c-Met inhibitor which exhibits greater than 50-fold selectivity for c-Met
  versus Flk and more than 500 times selectivity versus other tyrosine kinases such
  as FGFR-1, c-Src, PDGFβR, and EGFR . SU11274 inhibits cell viability and migration
  in c-Met-expressing cancer cells and abrogates HGF-induced phosphorylation of c-Met
  and its downstream signaling . SU11274 was used in the experiments as a positive
  control. The 10 µM dose of SU11274 was used in the assays based on earlier antiproliferative
  studies.




  Viable cell count was determined using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-2,5-diphenyl
  tetrazolium bromide colorimetric assay. The optical density of each sample was measured
  at 570 nm on a microplate reader. The number of cells/well was calculated against
  a standard curve prepared by plating various concentrations of cells, as determined
  using a hemocytometer at the start of each experiment.




  To optimize the concentration of HGF which induces maximum growth of human breast
  cancer cell lines after 72 h treatment period, MDA-MB-231, MCF-7 or BT-474 cells
  were plated at a density of 1×104 cells per well in 96-well culture plates and maintained
  in RPMI-1640 media supplemented with 10% FBS and allowed to adhere overnight. The
  next day, cells were washed with phosphate buffer saline, divided into different
  treatment groups and then given various concentrations of HGF in serum-free media.
  Cells in all groups were fed fresh treatment media every other day for a 72 h treatment
  period. Viable cell number was determined every day using the MTT assay.


  To evaluate the effect of-oleocanthal on the proliferation and growth of breast
  cancer cell lines, growth studies were performed. For growth studies, MDA-MB-231,
  MCF-7 or BT-474 cells were plated at a density of 1×104 cells per well in 96-well
  culture plates and maintained in RPMI-1640 media supplemented with 10% FBS and allowed
  to adhere overnight. The next day, cells were washed with PBS, divided into different
  treatment groups and then given various concentrations of-oleocanthal in serum-free
  media containing 40 ng/ml HGF or no HGF. Cells in all groups were fed fresh treatment
  media every other day for a 72 h treatment period. Viable cell number was determined
  every day using the MTT assay.


  To evaluate the effect of-oleocanthal on the proliferation and growth of immortalized
  non-tumorigenic mammary cells, MCF10A cells were plated at a density of 1×104 cells
  per well in 96-well culture plates and maintained in DMEM/F12 media containing 5%
  horse serum and allowed to attach overnight. The next day, cells were washed with
  PBS, divided into different treatment groups and then given various concentrations
  of-oleocanthal in serum-free defined media containing 40 ng/ml HGF. Cells in all
  groups were fed fresh treatment media every other day for a 72 h treatment period.
  Viable cell number was determined every day using the MTT assay.




  To study treatment effects of-oleocanthal on MDA-MB-231 cell cycle progression,
  cells in the various treatment groups were synchronized in G1 phase . Briefly, MDA-MB-231
  cells were plated at a density of 1×106 cells/100 mm culture plates in RPMI-1640
  media supplemented with 10% FBS and allowed to adhere overnight. Cells were then
  washed twice with PBS and starved in control or treatment serum-free medium containing
  0.5% FBS for 48 h to synchronize the cells in G1 phase. Afterwards, cells were fed
  various doses of-oleocanthal in serum-free defined media containing 40 ng/ml HGF
  as the mitogen for 24 h. To study the effect of-oleocanthal treatment on c-Met,
  Akt, and MAPK phosphorylation, MDA-MB-231 cells were plated at a density of 1×106
  cells/100 mm culture plates in RPMI-1640 media supplemented with 10% FBS and allowed
  to adhere overnight. Cells were then washed twice with PBS and starved in control
  or treatment medium containing 0.5% FBS for 72 h and stimulated with 100 ng/ml human
  recombinant HGF for 10 min before cell lysis. In order to examine whether or not
  caspase-3 and caspase-8 activation were involved in the apoptosis triggered by-oleocanthal,
  MDA-MB-231 cells were plated at a density of 3×106 cells/100 mm culture plates,
  and then allowed to attach overnight. Cells were then washed with PBS and pretreated
  with or without caspase family inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK for 3 h. Cells were then further
  incubated with DMSO or-oleocanthal for another 24 h in serum-free defined media
  containing 40 ng/ml HGF. In all other Western blot experiments, cells were plated
  at a density of 1×106 cells/100 mm culture plates, allowed to attach overnight and
  then washed with PBS and incubated in the respective control or treatment in serum-free
  defined media containing 40 ng/ml HGF as the mitogen for 72 h. In case of in vivo
  experiment, breast tumor tissues were stored at −80°C until protein extraction.
  At the end of treatment period, cells were lysed in RIPA buffer and breast tumor
  tissues were homogenized in RIPA buffer using an electric homogenizer. Protein concentration
  was determined by the BCA assay. Equivalent amounts of protein were electrophoresed
  on SDS–polyacrylamide gels. The gels were then electroblotted onto PVDF membranes.
  These PVDF membranes were then blocked with 2% BSA in 10 mM Tris-HCl containing
  50 mM NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.4 and then, incubated with specific primary antibodies
  overnight at 4°C. At the end of incubation period, membranes were washed 5 times
  with TBST and then incubated with respective horseradish peroxide-conjugated secondary
  antibody in 2% BSA in TBST for 1 h at room temperature followed by rinsing with
  TBST for 5 times. Blots were then visualized by chemiluminescence according to the
  manufacturer’s instructions. Images of protein bands from all treatment groups within
  a given experiment and scanning densitometric analysis were acquired using Kodak
  Gel Logic 1500 Imaging System. The visualization of β-tubulin was used to ensure
  equal sample loading in each lane. All experiments were repeated at least 3 times.




  To study treatment effects on cell cycle, MDA-MB-231 cells were plated and then
  synchronized in G1 phase and fed treatments as described above. At the end of the
  experiment, cells in the various treatment groups were isolated with trypsin and
  then resuspended in ice cold PBS, fixed with cold 70% ethanol, and stored at 4°C
  for 2 h. Afterwards, cells were rehydrated with ice cold PBS and then incubated
  with DNA staining buffer for 30 min at 4°C in the dark. DNA content was then analyzed
  using a FACS Calibur flow cytometer. For each sample, 10,000 events were recorded,
  and histograms were generated using CellQuest software. All experiments were repeated
  at least three times.




  The in vitro wound-healing assay was used to assess directional cell motility in
  two dimensions. MDA-MB-231 cells were plated in sterile flat-bottom 24-well plates
  and allowed to form a subconfluent cell monolayer per well overnight. Wounds were
  then scratched in each cell monolayer using a sterile 200 µl pipette tip. Media
  was removed and cells were washed twice with PBS and once with fresh serum-free
  media to remove floating cells. Cells were then incubated in culture media containing-oleocanthal
  or SU11274 at the desired concentrations in serum-free defined media containing
  40 ng/ml HGF as the mitogen. Cell were incubated for a 24 h culture period and afterward,
  media was removed and cells were washed with pre-cooled PBS, fixed with methanol
  previously cooled to −20°C, and stained with Giemsa. Wound healing was visualized
  at 0 and 24 h by Nikon ECLIPSE TE200-U microscope. Digital images were captured
  using Nikon NIS Elements software. The distance traveled by the cells was determined
  by measuring the wound width at time 24 h and subtracting it from the wound width
  at the start of treatment. The values obtained were then expressed as % migration,
  setting the gap width at t0 as 100%. Each experiment was done in triplicate and
  the distance migrated was calculated in three or more randomly selected fields per
  treatment group.




  MDA-MB-231 cell invasion was determined using the CytoSelect Cell Invasion Assay
  according to manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, MDA-MB-231 cells were pre-treated
  with-oleocanthal for 24 h. Basement membranes of Boyden chambers were rehydrated
  with 300 µl serum free RPMI-1640, and 3×105 cells were then seeded into the upper
  area of the chamber in serum free RPMI-1640. Bottom wells were filled with defined
  control serum-free media supplemented with 40 ng/ml HGF containing-oleocanthal or
  no-oleocanthal. After 24 h incubation, non-invasive cells were removed from the
  upper chamber and cell invasion was assessed by light microscopy after staining
  of invaded cells with crystal violet Cell Stain Solution. For colorimetric quantification
  of invasion, inserts were then placed in extraction buffer, and absorbance at 560
  nm was determined after transfer to a 96 well plate using a BioTek microtiter plate
  reader.




  Induction of apoptosis was assessed by the binding of annexin V to phosphatidylserine,
  which is externalized to the outer leaflet of plasma membrane early during induction
  of apoptosis. Analysis of annexin V was determined using Annexin V-FITC Early Apoptosis
  Detection Kit. Cells were plated at a density of 5×106 cells/100 mm culture plates,
  allowed to attach overnight. Afterwards, cells were incubated in the respective
  control or-oleocanthal treated defined serum-free medium containing 40 ng/ml of
  HGF for 24 h. At the end of the experiment, cells in each treatment group were isolated
  with trypsin and then washed twice with ice cold PBS. Cells were then resuspended
  in 96 µl of ice-cold 1X Annexin V Binding Buffer. Afterwards, 1 µl Annexin V-FITC
  Conjugate and 12.5 µl Propidium Iodide Solution were added to each 96 µl cell suspension.
  The cells were then incubated for 10 min on ice in the dark. The cell suspension
  was then diluted to a final volume of 250 µl per assay with ice-cold, 1X Annexin
  V Binding Buffer. Dot plots were generated using CellQuest software, and they were
  divided into 4 quadrants. The LL quadrant shows cells negative for both annexin
  V and PI. The LR quadrant shows cells positive for annexin V, but negative for PI.
  The UL quadrant shows cells positive for PI, but negative to annexin V, whereas
  the UR quadrant shows cells positive for both annexin V and PI. All experiments
  were repeated at least three times.




  Transfection of small interfering RNA into cells was conducted when the cells reached
  70% confluence. The siRNAs of c-Met and a non-targeting control were purchased from
  Cell Signaling Technology. Experiments were conducted using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX
  Reagent as a transfection agent and siRNA, and experiments were conducted according
  to the manufacturers’ instructions.




  All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee,
  University of Louisiana at Monroe, and were handled in strict accordance with good
  animal practice as defined by the NIH guidelines. Athymic nude mice were purchased
  from Harlan. The mice had free access to standard pellet food and water. The animals
  were acclimated to animal house facility conditions at a temperature of 18–25°C,
  with a relative humidity of 55 to 65% and a 12 h light/dark cycle, for one week
  prior to the experiments. MDA-MB-231/GFP human breast cancer cells were cultured
  and resuspended in serum-free DMEM medium. After anesthesia, cell suspensions were
  inoculated subcutaneously into the second mammary gland fat pad just beneath the
  nipple of each animal to generate orthotopic breast tumors. At 48 h post-inoculation,
  the mice were randomly divided into two groups: i) the vehicle-treated control group,
  ii) the-oleocanthal-treated group. Treatment started 5 days postinoculation with
  intraperitoneal administered vehicle control or 5 mg/kg-oleocanthal. Selection of
  this dose was based on earlier in vivo studies on oleocanthal .-Oleocanthal treatment
  was prepared by dissolving 5 mg of-oleocanthal in 100 µl DMSO to prepare a stock
  solution, then dissolving 20 µl of stock solution in 980 µl normal saline just prior
  to the injection. The mice were monitored by measuring tumor volume, body weight,
  and clinical observation. Tumor volume was calculated by V = L/2 x W2, where L was
  the length and W was the width of tumors. All the mice were sacrificed at day 33
  postinoculation, and the tumors were excised and weighed. Breast tumor tissues were
  stored at −80°C until total protein extraction for Western blot analysis.




  The tumor specimens were processed with the use of alcohols and xylene and then
  infiltrated in paraffin wax using the Excelsior ES Tissue Processor. Paraffin sections
  were dewaxed in xylene, rinsed in grade alcohol, and rehydrated in water and then
  were placed in citric buffer and treated in a microwave oven with high power for
  3 min and 10% goat serum for 30 min. Subsequently, antibodies with proper dilution
  were applied on the sections as follows: CD31 and Ki-67. Following that, secondary
  antibodies were applied. Signals were developed with Vector ImmPACT DAB Product#SK-4105
  for 8 mins at RT. The sections were finally counter stained by hematoxylin solution
  for 1 min at RT.




  To evaluate positive Ki-67 cells in breast cancer tissues, 5 areas were examined
  at a magnification of ×200. Microvessel density of breast tumor tissue sections
  was evaluated. Any CD31+stained endothelial cell or endothelial cell cluster was
  counted as one microvessel. The mean microvessel count of the five most vascular
  areas was taken as the MVD, which was expressed as the absolute number of microvessels
  per 1.485 mm2.




  The results are presented as means ± SEM of at least three independent experiments.
  Differences among various treatment groups were determined by the analysis of variance
  followed by Dunnett’s test using PASW statistics version 18. A difference of P;0.05
  was considered statistically significant as compared to the vehicle-treated control
  group. The IC50 values were determined using non-linear regression curve fit analysis
  using GraphPad Prism software version 5.






  The activation of c-Met with HGF is known to play an important role in cell proliferation
  in many kinds of cancer cells. Therefore, the role of HGF on the proliferation and
  growth of MDA-MB-231, MCF-7 and BT-474 breast cancer cells was investigated. Cell
  proliferation assay was performed in cells treated with HGF at concentrations of
  0, 10, 20, 40, and 100 ng/ml. MTT assay results after 72 h treatment showed that
  HGF caused a dose-dependent increase in breast cancer cells proliferation and the
  maximum effect was identified at 40 ng/ml of HGF in all three breast cancer cell
  lines.

  BT-474 breast cancer cell lines.


  (A) HGF stimulates the growth of human breast cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner

  treatment on growth of MDA-MB-231, MCF-7 and BT-474 cancer cells in the presence
  or absence of 40 ng/ml HGF after 72 h treatment period. Effects of-oleocanthal treatment
  on the viability of non-tumorigenic human MCF10A mammary epithelial cells after
  a 72 h treatment period. In these assays, cells were plated at a density of 1×104
  cells per well in 96-well plates and maintained in media supplemented with 10% FBS
  and allowed to adhere overnight. The next day, cells were washed with PBS, divided
  into different treatment groups. Cells were fed fresh treatment media every other
  day for a 72 h treatment period. Viable cell count was determined by MTT assay.
  Vertical bars indicate the mean cell count ± SEM in each treatment group. P&lt;0.05

  The antiproliferative effects of various doses of-oleocanthal on HGF-mediated growth
  of MDA-MB-231, MCF-7 and BT-474 breast cancer cells after 24, 48 and 72 h culture
  periods are shown in Figure 2B. HGF at a concentration of 40 ng/ml was used in growth
  studies as it showed maximum growth induction in the three human breast cancer cell
  lines investigated.-Oleocanthal treatment caused a dose-dependent suppression of
  HGF-induced proliferation of MDA-MB-231, MCF-7 and BT-474 cells after 48 and 72
  h. However, larger concentrations of-oleocanthal were required to significantly
  abolish cell viability of MDA-MB-231, MCF-7 and BT-474 cells grown in HGF-free media
  after 72 h with a little or no effect after 48 h. The IC50 values for-oleocanthal
  treatment in HGF-supplemented media were 10.9, 20.1 and 25.4 µM in MDA-MB-231, MCF-7
  and BT-474 breast cancer cells, respectively. However, the IC50 values for-oleocanthal
  treatment in HGF-free media were 16.2, 40.8 and 58.4 µM in MDA-MB-231, MCF-7 and
  BT-474 breast cancer cells, respectively. These results indicate that-oleocanthal
  treatment inhibits HGF-dependent MDA-MB-231, MCF-7 and BT-474 cell growth in a dose
  and time-responsive manner as compared to cells in the vehicle-treated control groups.




  Treatment effects of-oleocanthal on the growth of immortalized non-tumorigenic human
  mammary epithelial cells over 24, 48 and 72 h culture periods are shown in Figure
  2C. Results showed that treatment with 0–40 µM-oleocanthal had no effect on MCF10A
  cell viability as compared to their respective vehicle treated control groups. In
  contrast, treatment with 60 µM caused a significant cell growth inhibition only
  after 72 h incubation period. These results suggest selectivity of-oleocanthal antiproliferative
  effect toward breast cancer cells.




  The effects of-oleocanthal treatment on cell cycle progression was evaluated using
  flow cytometry and Western blot analysis. MDA-MB-231 cells exposed to various concentrations
  of-oleocanthal resulted in a dose-dependent increase in the proportion of cells
  in G1 phase of the cell cycle from 50% to nearly 82% with 15 µM-oleocanthal treatment.
  These studies also showed that no sub-G1 population of cells was observed in any
  of the treatment groups, indicating that none of the treatments initiated apoptosis
  in MDA-MB-231 cells at these concentrations.

  and mitogenic signaling in human MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells.


  (A) Flow cytometry analysis for cell cycle progression in control and-oleocanthal-treated
  MDA-MB-231 cells. Cells in the various treatment groups were synchronized in G1
  phase. Briefly, MDA-MB-231 cells were plated at a density of 1×106 cells/100 mm
  plates in RPMI-1640 media supplemented with 10% FBS and allowed to adhere overnight.
  Cells were then washed twice with PBS and starved in control or treatment serum-free
  medium containing 0.5% FBS for 48 h to synchronize the cells in G1 phase. Afterwards,
  cells were fed various doses of-oleocanthal in serum-free defined media containing
  40 ng/ml HGF as the mitogen for 24 h. Left panel shows histograms generated using
  CellQuest software. Right panel shows percentage of cells in each phase of cell
  cycle. Vertical bars show the average of 3 independent experiments. Western blot
  analysis showing-oleocanthal treatment effects on G1/S cell cycle regulatory proteins.
  Cells in the various treatment groups were synchronized in G1 phase in the same
  way described above.-Oleocanthal treatment caused a marked downregulation of cyclin
  D1 and CDK6, while it caused upregulation of p21 and p27. Western blot analysis
  showing-oleocanthal treatment effects on c-Met downstream mitogenic signaling proteins
  Akt and MAPK. MDA-MB-231 cells were plated at a density of 1×106 cells/100 mm culture
  plates in RPMI-1640 media supplemented with 10% FBS and allowed to adhere overnight.
  Cells were then washed twice with PBS and starved in control or treatment medium
  containing 0.5% FBS for 72 h and stimulated with 100 ng/ml human recombinant HGF
  for 10 min before cell lysis. SU11274 was used as a positive control. Afterwards,
  whole cell lysates were prepared for subsequent separation by polyacrylamide gel
  electrophoresis followed by Western blot analysis. Scanning densitometric analysis
  was performed on all blots done in triplicate and the integrated optical density
  of each band was normalized with corresponding β-tubulin, as shown in bar graphs
  beside their respective Western blot images. Vertical bars in the graph indicate
  the normalized integrated optical density of bands visualized in each lane ± SEM,
  P&lt;0.05 as compared with vehicle-treated controls.



  Additional studies were conducted to determine the effects of-oleocanthal treatment
  on the relative intracellular levels of cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases, cyclin-dependent
  kinase inhibitors and mitogenic signaling proteins as determined by Western blot
  analysis. Treatment with-oleocanthal resulted in a prominent reduction in cyclin
  D1 levels as compared to the vehicle-treated control group. In addition, treatment
  of MDA-MB-231 cells with 5–15 µM-oleocanthal was not found to have any effect on
  the relative levels of CDK4. However,-oleocanthal treatment caused a relatively
  large reduction in CDK6 levels and marked increase in the levels of the CKI proteins
  p21 and p27, compared to the vehicle-treated controls.


  Results also showed that-oleocanthal treatment caused a dose-dependent inhibition
  of HGF-induced Akt and MAPK phosphorylation, important downstream signaling molecules
  in c-Met signaling. This effect was comparable to the known c-Met inhibitor SU11274.




  The important characteristic of metastasis is the migratory and invasive ability
  of tumor cells. To test the effect of-oleocanthal on HGF-induced MDA-MB-231 cell
  migration, wound healing assay was performed. HGF at 40 ng/ml induced cellular migration
  with more than 85% wound closure after a 24 h treatment period. Figure 4A shows
  the ability of-oleocanthal to significantly suppress HGF-induced cell migration
  in a dose-dependent manner. Treatment of the cells with 5, 10, and 15 µM-oleocanthal
  for 24 h inhibited cell migration by 22%, 65%, and 78%, respectively. A 10 µM treatment
  with the known c-Met kinase inhibitor SU11274 inhibited cell migration by 88%. The
  effect of-oleocanthal on cell invasion was examined using transwell chamber assay.
  As shown in Figure 4B,-oleocanthal significantly decreased the level of HGF-mediated
  cell invasion through the matrigel in a dose-dependent manner. Treatment of MDA-MB-231
  breast cancer cells with 5, 10, and 15 µM-oleocanthal for 24 h inhibited the number
  of cells invading the lower chamber by 26%, 35%, and 62%, respectively.

  blot analysis showing-oleocanthal treatment effects on Brk/Paxillin/Rac1 pathway
  signaling after 72 h treatment in MDA-MB-231 cancer cells. Cells were plated at
  1×106 cells/100 mm culture plates, allowed to attach overnight and then washed with
  PBS and incubated in the respective control or treatment in serum-free defined media
  containing 40 ng/ml HGF as the mitogen for 72 h. Afterwards, whole cell lysates
  were prepared for subsequent separation by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed
  by Western blot analysis. Scanning densitometric analysis was performed on all blots
  done in triplicate and the integrated optical density of each band was normalized
  with corresponding β-tubulin, as shown in bar graphs beside their respective Western
  blot images. Vertical bars in the graph indicate the normalized integrated optical
  density of bands visualized in each lane ± SEM, P&lt;0.05 as compared with vehicle-treated
  controls.



  To study the effects of-oleocanthal treatment on Brk/Paxillin/Rac1 pathway, Western
  blot analysis was performed. Results showed potent dose-dependent inhibition of
  Brk phosphorylation after treatment with-oleocanthal for 72 h in MDA-MB-231 cancer
  cells compared to the vehicle-treated control group. Alternatively,-oleocanthal
  treatment had no effects on the total levels of Brk in treated cells. Moreover,
  the effect of-oleocanthal on Brk phosphorylation was associated with dose-dependent
  suppression of paxillin and Rac1 phosphorylation without affecting their total levels.
  These results suggest that-oleocanthal significantly blocked HGF-induced migration
  and invasion of the highly invasive MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. This effect
  might be related, at least in part, to the suppression of Brk/paxillin/Rac1 signaling
  pathway.




  In this study, MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, and BT-474 human breast cancer cells were used
  to assess the effect of-oleocanthal on HGF-induced c-Met phosphorylation. Phospho-c-Met
  refers to the phosphorylation of the kinase domain at Y1234/1235. Western blot analysis
  results showed that-oleocanthal treatment caused a dose-dependent inhibition of
  HGF-induced phosphorylation of c-Met in the three breast cancer cell lines investigated.
  However,-oleocanthal treatment did not affect the total levels of c-Met at the doses
  used for the treatment of the three breast cancer cell lines. In addition, treatment
  of MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, and BT-474 human breast cancer cells with-oleocanthal resulted
  in a marked increase in the levels of epithelial markers E-cadherin and zona occludens
  1 in the three cell lines, and decreased the expression of the mesenchymal marker
  vimentin in MDA-MB-231, compared to the vehicle-treated control groups. However,
  vimentin was below the level of detection in MCF-7 and BT-474 cells. In addition,-oleocanthal
  treatment showed cell line-specific change of β-catenin levels. In MDA-MB-231,-oleocanthal
  treatment resulted in little or no change of β-catenin expression, while it caused
  a dose-dependent reduction of β-catenin expression levels in MCF-7 and BT-474 cells.
  Therefore, it can be concluded that-oleocanthal stabilizes the epithelial phenotype,
  and reduces mesenchymal phenotype in breast cancer cells.






  Figure 5. -Oleocanthal treatment inhibits HGF-induced Met activation, stabilizes
  the epithelial phenotype, and reduces mesenchymal phenotype in breast cancer cells.


  (A) Western blot analysis.-Oleocanthal caused a dose-dependent inhibition of HGF-induced
  phosphorylation of c-Met in MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, and BT-474 breast tumor cells with
  no effect on total Met levels. Cells were plated at 1×106 cells/100 mm culture plates
  in RPMI-1640 media supplemented with 10% FBS and allowed to adhere overnight. Cells
  were then washed twice with PBS and starved in control or treatment medium containing
  0.5% FBS for 72 h and stimulated with 100 ng/ml human recombinant HGF for 10 min
  before cell lysis. SU11274 was used as a positive control. Western blot analysis.-Oleocanthal
  resulted in a marked increase in the level of epithelial markers E-cadherin and
  Zo-1 in MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, and BT-474 cells and a decrease of mesenchymal marker
  vimentin expression compared to the vehicle-treated control groups.-Oleocanthal
  treatment resulted in downregulation of β-catenin in MCF-7 and BT-474 cells. Cells
  were plated at 1×106 cells/100 mm culture plates, allowed to attach overnight and
  then washed with PBS and incubated in the respective control or treatment in serum-free
  defined media containing 40 ng/ml HGF as the mitogen for 72 h. Whole cell lysates
  were prepared for subsequent separation by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed
  by Western blot analysis. Scanning densitometric analysis was performed on all blots
  done in triplicate and the integrated optical density of each band was normalized
  with corresponding β-tubulin, as shown in bar graphs below their respective Western
  blot images. Vertical bars in the graph indicate the normalized integrated optical
  density of bands visualized in each lane ± SEM, P&lt;0.05 as compared with vehicle-treated
  controls.





  The present study has demonstrated that-oleocanthal at 25 µM induced apoptosis in
  MDA-MB-231 cells. The cells were treated with 5, 15, and 25 µM of-oleocanthal for
  24 h. Cell death was assessed after treatment by determination of annexin V and
  PI binding using flow cytometry.-Oleocanthal produced a concentration-dependent
  increase in annexin V labeling, in the absence of PI staining, with a maximal increase
  at 25 µM. Subsequent Western blot analysis showed that-oleocanthal treatment at
  25 µM markedly increased levels of cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved PARP, both of which
  are positive markers for apoptosis, in these cells following a 72 h culture period.






  Figure 6. -Oleocanthal treatment induces apoptosis at 25 µM in MDA-MB-231 breast
  cancer cells.


  (A) Flow cytometry analysis. Cells were plated at a density of 5×106 cells/100 mm
  culture plates, allowed to attach overnight. Afterwards, cells were incubated in
  the respective control or-oleocanthal-treated RPMI-1640 medium containing 40 ng/ml
  HGF for 24 h. At the end of the experiment, cells in each treatment group were trypsinized,
  washed then resuspended in ice-cold 1X Annexin V Binding Buffer. Afterwards, the
  cells were treated as described in the Materials and Methods. In the dot plot of
  double variable flow cytometry, LL quadrant shows living cells; UR quadrant stands
  for late apoptotic cells; and LR quadrant represents early apoptotic cells. Western
  blot analysis of cleaved caspase 3 and cleaved PARP.-Oleocanthal treatment at 25
  µM for 72 h markedly increased levels of cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved PARP. Western
  blot analysis.-Oleocanthal at 25 µM for 72 h downregulates c-Met levels without
  affecting EGFR levels, and right panel shows that transfection of MDA-MB-231 cells
  with c-Met-targeted siRNA totally abolished c-Met protein expression. Western blot
  analysis of cleaved caspase 8, RIP, cleaved caspase 9 and cytochrome c. Treatment
  with 25 µM-oleocanthal increased the cleavage of caspase-8 and RIP, but not caspase-9
  or cytochrome c. Right panel shows that c-Met-targeted siRNA yielded a pattern of
  apoptosis that is similar to that following treatment with-oleocanthal at 25 µM
  for 72 h by causing an increase in caspase-8 and RIP cleavage, with no effect on
  caspase-9 and cytochrome c levels. Effect of Z-VAD-FMK on-oleocanthal-induced apoptosis.
  MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with 25 µM-oleocanthal in the presence or absence
  of caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK. After 24-h incubation, cells were analyzed to examine
  cell death by measuring caspase 3 and caspase 8 cleavage detected by Western blotting.
  In all the above experiments, whole cell lysates were prepared for subsequent separation
  by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Western blot analysis. Scanning
  densitometric analysis was performed on all blots done in triplicate and the integrated
  optical density of each band was normalized with corresponding β-tubulin, as shown
  in bar graphs beside their respective Western blot images. Vertical bars in the
  graph indicate the normalized integrated optical density of bands visualized in
  each lane ± SEM, P&lt;0.05 as compared with vehicle-treated controls.



  EGFR, HER-2, and c-Met are among the most critical proteins for breast cancer proliferation
  and survival. The effects of-oleocanthal exposure on EGFR, HER-2, and c-Met protein
  expression were evaluated by Western blotting in MDA-MB-231 cells. Results revealed
  that c-Met protein levels were downregulated with-oleocanthal treatment at 25 µM,
  while EGFR levels were unchanged. HER-2 levels were barely detectable in this cell
  line.


  Further Western blot studies have shown that treatment with 25 µM-oleocanthal increased
  the cleavage of caspase-8 and RIP, but not caspase-9 or cytochrome c. These results
  indicate that treatment with-oleocanthal at 25 µM seems to be associated with caspase-8-dependent
  pathway, rather than mitochondrial stress, which results in activation of caspase-8,
  cleavage of RIP and caspase-3, leading to the proteolytic cleavage of PARP and activation
  of programmed cell death.


  To further explore the role of c-Met in the survival of MDA-MB-231 cells; siRNA
  was used to specifically inhibit c-Met expression in these cells. Transfection of
  c-Met-targeted siRNA decreased c-Met protein expression by at least 90%. The transfected
  adherent MDA-MB-231 cells exhibited a rounded-up phenotype starting after 24 h due
  to a mitotic arrest. Interestingly, c-Met depletion yielded a pattern of apoptosis
  that is remarkably similar to that following treatment with-oleocanthal at 25 µM.
  Transfection of c-Met-targeted siRNA caused an increase in caspase-8 and RIP cleavage,
  with no effect on caspase-9 and cytochrome c levels. These findings indicate that-oleocanthal
  at 25 µM sensitizes cancer cells to induce caspase-8-dependent intrinsic apoptosis,
  at least in part, by downregulating c-Met expression in MDA-MB-231 human breast
  cancer cells. To further confirm the involvement of caspase-3 and caspase-8 activation
  in-oleocanthal-induced apoptosis, MDA-MB-231 cells were pretreated with or without
  caspase family inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK. The results showed that 25 µM-oleocanthal powerfully
  induces caspase-8 and caspase-3 activation and apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells, and
  caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK treatment was able to completely inhibit the-oleocanthal-induced
  apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells.




  To test the antitumor activity of-oleocanthal, orthotopic nude mouse model using
  MDA-MB-231/GFP human breast cancer cell line was used. In this experiment, 5 mg/kg-oleocanthal
  caused a reduction in tumor growth by 60%, compared to vehicle-treated control group
  while it had no adverse effect on mice body weight or other clinical symptoms, indicating-oleocanthal
  lacks potential systemic toxicity in athymic nude mice. In addition, Western blot
  analysis of isolated tumor tissues showed relatively lower levels of phospho c-Met
  when compared to the vehicle treated control group without any change of total c-Met
  levels. Moreover, there was no increase in cleaved PARP levels in the group of animals
  treated with-oleocanthal suggesting that-oleocanthal activity is mediated through
  cytostatic mechanisms rather than inducing apoptosis at the dose tested in vivo.
  Furthermore, immunohistochemical analysis of tumor specimens showed that-oleocanthal
  treatment suppressed mitosis and new vessel formation as evident by the suppression
  of the expression of their markers Ki-67 and CD31, respectively, compared to the
  vehicle-treated control group. Tumor MVD calculated by new vessel formation using
  CD31 staining decreased significantly after-oleocanthal treatment.

  model.


  MDA-MB-231/GFP human breast cancer cells were cultured and resuspended in serum-free
  DMEM medium. After anesthesia, cell suspensions were inoculated subcutaneously into
  the second mammary gland fat pad just beneath the nipple of each athymic nude mouse
  to generate orthotopic breast tumors. At 48 h post-inoculation, the mice were randomly
  divided into two groups: i) the vehicle-treated control group, ii) the-oleocanthal-treated
  group. Treatment started 5 days postinoculation with intraperitoneal administered
  vehicle control or 5 mg/kg-oleocanthal. Left panel; tumor size was evaluated periodically
  during treatment at indicated days postinoculation. Tumor volume was calculated

  which was expressed as the absolute number of microvessels per 1.485 mm2. Vertical

  Results of the present study demonstrated that-oleocanthal treatment suppressed
  HGF-stimulated growth of human breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231, MCF-7 and BT-474
  cells in dose- and time-dependent manners. Alternatively,-oleocanthal treatment
  had little or no effect on the growth and/or viability of the non-tumorigenic human
  MCF10A mammary epithelial cells at a concentration which was many folds higher than
  the growth inhibitory concentration of the neoplastic breast cancer cells. In the
  highly metastatic MDA-MB-231 mammary cancer cells,-oleocanthal treatment was also
  associated with induction of G1 cell cycle arrest. Further results showed that-oleocanthal
  treatment caused a marked dose-dependent inhibitory effect on HGF-induced migration
  and invasion of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells in vitro. Remarkably, findings of
  animal studies showed that-oleocanthal treatment resulted in a significant inhibition
  of tumor growth in an orthotopic model of breast cancer as compared to vehicle-treated
  control animals.


  Breast cancer is not a single disease but is highly heterogeneous at both the molecular
  and clinical levels . The molecular differences result in distinct clinical outcomes
  and responses to treatment . Recently, strong evidence supports the role for the
  hepatocyte growth factor and its receptor in the development and progression of
  breast carcinoma . Under physiological conditions, HGF regulates epithelial development
  and morphogenesis in different organs . In the human breast, HGF is produced primarily
  in the mammary stroma, whereas c-Met is expressed in the epithelium . HGF-mediated
  activation of c-Met results in a complex genetic program referred to as “invasive
  growth”, consisting of a series of physiological processes, including cell proliferation,
  motility, invasion, angiogenesis, and branching tubulogenesis . Results of this
  study showed that HGF stimulated the growth of multiple mammary epithelial carcinoma
  cell lines in vitro. HGF induced activation and phosphorylation of c-Met in MDA-MB-231,
  MCF-7 and BT474 breast cancer cells in culture. Treatment with-oleocanthal resulted
  in a dose- and time-dependent inhibition of the growth of mammary cancer cells in
  vitro. The inhibition of mammary cancer cell growth was associated with the ability
  of-oleocanthal treatment to block c-Met receptor activation in response to its natural
  ligand HGF in MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, and BT474 cancer cell lines in culture. In addition,
  the antiproliferative activity of-oleocanthal was accomplished in cancer cells maintained
  in the presence of HGF as well as in HGF-free treatment media. Interestingly, concentrations
  of-oleocanthal required to induce 50% inhibition of cancer cell growth were greater
  for breast cancer cells maintained in HGF-free media as compared to those maintained
  in media supplied with HGF. While this finding indicated that-oleocanthal treatment
  is more effective in the presence of HGF, confirming a direct inhibition of the
  HGF/c-Met axis, these results also suggest other potential mechanisms for the antiproliferative
  effects of-oleocanthal that may not be mediated through a direct suppression of
  the HGF/c-Met signaling pathway. Furthermore,-oleocanthal treatment was shown to
  have no remarkable effect on the viability and growth of non-tumorigenic MCF10A
  mammary epithelial cells in culture. Thus,-oleocanthal treatment can achieve significant
  antiproliferative effects with concentrations that have no or little effect on the
  viability of the non-tumorigenic mammary epithelial cells.


  The biological functions of the HGF/c-Met signaling are mediated through a variety
  of downstream effectors. The results of this study showed that activation of the
  HGF/c-Met signaling pathway in MDA-MB-231 mammary cancer cells resulted in the activation
  of downstream effectors Akt and MAPK. Exposure to growth inhibitory concentrations
  of-oleocanthal blocked HGF-induced phosphorylation and activation of Akt and MAPK
  in MDA-MD-231 mammary cancer cells. It is well-established that HGF/c-Met signaling
  for mitogenesis and growth occurs through the MAPK signaling pathway , . In addition,
  activation of c-Met prevents apoptosis and maintains cancer cell survival through
  activation of PI3K and subsequent Akt-NFκB activation , . Accordingly,-oleocanthal
  treatment effectively blocked growth and mitogenesis through suppression of HGF-induced
  c-Met activation and subsequent activation of downstream effectors. During mitogenesis,
  progression through the cell cycle is a highly organized and regulated process.
  Cells must pass through a restriction point in the G1 phase before progression into
  S phase and subsequently undergoing mitosis . Early in G1 phase progression, mitogenic
  factors enhance the expression of cyclin D1. CDK4/6 are activated by binding to
  cyclin D1 and these cyclin/CDK complexes consequently phosphorylate the cell cycle
  restriction protein, retinoblastoma, thereby releasing E2F transcription factors
  and leading to the transcription of genes required for progression through the S
  phase . Upstream inhibitors such as p21 and p27 alter the activity of the CDK-cyclin
  complexes .-Oleocanthal treatment was shown to reduce expression of cyclin D1 and
  CDK6, and caused a corresponding increase in p21 and p27 levels in MDA-MB-231 breast
  cancer cells. Thus,-oleocanthal treatment is associated with cytostatic activity
  and G1 cell cycle arrest, the findings that contribute to the growth inhibitory
  activity of this compound in mammary tumors. It is well established that blockade
  of cell cycle progression can initiate programmed cell death in a number of tumor
  cell types. Results of the present study showed that higher concentration of-oleocanthal
  treatment induced apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells. Cytotoxic activity of-oleocanthal
  was initiated by activation of caspase-8 and cleavage of RIP and caspase-3, leading
  to the proteolytic cleavage of PARP. It has been reported that death domain kinase
  is cleaved by cleaved caspase-8 in death receptor-mediated apoptosis . Apoptosis
  of MDA-MB-231 cells by-oleocanthal was associated with a marked reduction of the
  total c-Met protein expression. These findings indicate that c-Met protects breast
  cancer cells from apoptosis and it contributes to their survival.-Oleocanthal treatment
  caused apoptosis of breast cancer cells by downregulating c-Met.


  HGF is able to induce epithelial cell dissociation and scattering. Earlier studies
  have shown HGF to act as a motogen or morphogen in most breast carcinoma cell lines
  . In order for epithelial cells to ‘scatter,’ the attenuation of cell-cell adhesions
  is a prerequisite , . HGF-induced scattering and motility is a tightly controlled
  process mediated by multiple effectors including Rac, Rho, and Brk , , . Results
  of this study showed that-oleocanthal treatment effectively suppressed HGF-induced
  migration of MDA-MD-231 in wound healing assay. Similarly,-oleocanthal blocked HGF-induced
  invasion of the highly invasive MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. The antimigratory
  and anti-invasive activities of-oleocanthal were associated with suppression of
  activation of Brk, paxillin, and Rac1 in response to HGF stimulation in MDA-MB-231
  cancer cells. These findings are of particular significance taking into consideration
  that c-Met-mediated invasive growth plays an important role in the development of
  the more aggressive and metastatic phenotypes of breast cancer. Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal
  Transition is considered to be the first step in the metastatic cascade of carcinoma
  cells . In EMT, epithelial cells lose cell-cell contacts and apical-basal polarity,
  and acquire mesenchymal phenotype . It has been proposed that EMT is involved in
  cancer progression, particularly during invasion, intravasation and migration. E-cadherins
  are a family of transmembrane glycoproteins that mediate cell-cell adhesion. E-cadherin
  is expressed in most epithelial cells, and it is primarily responsible for the initial
  adhesion of these cells and also promotes polarity. Analysis of many epithelial
  cancers suggested that loss of E-cadherin correlates with tumor cell invasion .
  Vimentin is an intermediate filament protein normally expressed in cells of mesenchymal
  origin . Vimentin regulates cell migration in many cell types . It has been reported
  that the loss of E-cadherin causes disruption of cell adhesion and polarity allowing
  tumor cell metastasis, while the translocation of β-catenin into the nucleus might
  be required to induce the expression of genes that promote cell proliferation and
  invasion . Eventually, epithelial cells that undergo EMT lose their epithelial cell
  characteristics to acquire a mesenchymal phenotype and become migratory and invasive
  . c-Met is a key promoter of EMT . Previous studies showed that sustained activation
  of HGF/c-Met signaling is associated with dissociation of cadherin-based adherens
  junctions, followed by loss of E-cadherin expression , . Based on our study,-oleocanthal
  treatment restored the expression of the epithelial markers E-cadherin and Zo-1
  in MDA-MB-231 and suppressed the expression of the mesenchymal marker vimentin.
  Alternatively,-oleocanthal treatment stabilized the expression E-cadherin and Zo-1
  in MCF-7 and BT-474 breast cancer cells. Therefore, these findings suggested that-oleocanthal
  treatment caused a marked reduction in mammary cancer cell scattering, motility,
  and invasion proposing a potential role of-oleocanthal in stabilizing cell-cell
  adhesion. In vivo characterization of-oleocanthal treatment showed a potent inhibition
  of MDA-MB-231 xenograft growth in female athymic nude mice.-Oleocanthal administration
  in experimental animals resulted is suppression of tumor growth as compared to control
  animals. These findings were associated with decreased cancer cell proliferation
  as indicated by a reduction of Ki-67 and CD31 staining in treated animals. In agreement
  with cellular data, MDA-MB-231 tumors from-oleocanthal-treated mice revealed a marked
  decrease in c-Met phosphorylation in comparison with those of control mice.


  Given the oncogenic role of aberrant HGF/c-Met signaling, c-Met has become an attractive
  therapeutic target. Several different strategies are being explored to reach this
  goal, including the development of competitors of HGF/c-Met, monoclonal antibodies
  directed against HGF and c-Met, inhibitors of c-Met expression, and small-molecule
  tyrosine kinase inhibitors directed against c-Met , . Whereas some of these approaches
  are better suited to block ligand-mediated c-Met activity, small molecule kinase
  inhibitors offer the most versatile approach by inhibiting HGF-dependent tumors
  as well as tumors driven by other c-Met-dependent mechanisms, such as receptor amplification
  and activating mutations , . Earlier studies identified-oleocanthal as potential
  inhibitor for the c-Met kinase domain . However, a growing evidence in literature
  shows that the potential anticancer mechanisms of-oleocanthal are not limited to
  its c-Met inhibitory activity. Clearly,-oleocanthal exerts a remarkable anti-inflammatory
  activity . The anti-inflammatory activity of oleocanthal is mediated through inhibition
  of macrophage inflammatory protein 1- alpha and interleukin-6 expression and secretion
  , . Recently, oleocanthal anti-inflammatory activity has been also associated with
  inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase, an enzyme which catalyzes the initial steps in the
  biosynthesis of pro-inflammatory leukotrienes . Additionally, oleocanthal demonstrated
  a potent inhibitory activity of heat shock protein 90, an essential molecular chaperone
  involved in different cancer hallmarks . Investigations by Margarucci and colleagues
  revealed ATPase activity inhibition and changes in the Hsp90 oligomerization state
  promoting the loss of Hsp90 molecular chaperone function upon treatment with oleocanthal
  . Moreover, the knowledge available on the metabolic fate, absorption and bioavailability
  of-oleocanthal is still unclear . Accordingly, the molecular mechanism of action
  of−oleocanthal is being a subject of investigation recently. Clearly,-oleocanthal
  interferes with multiple pathways in cancer. These findings might explain, at least
  in part, the significant in vivo activity of-oleocanthal in this study.


  (-)-Oleocanthal, an olive-oil phenolic component, has captured an increasing interest
  in the elucidation and characterization of its potential anticancer activity. Collectively,
  the present findings of this study promoted-oleocanthal from hit to lead status
  for the control of breast cancer.-Oleocanthal reduced c-Met kinase activity, cell
  growth, migration, and invasion of breast cancer cells. In addition,-oleocanthal
  induced G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, as well as inhibited c-Met-dependent
  signaling in cultured breast cancer cells and tumorigenicity in mouse model. These
  findings further promote-oleocanthal as a promising lead with potential therapeutic
  use as a dietary supplement for the control of c-Met-dependent malignancies.
