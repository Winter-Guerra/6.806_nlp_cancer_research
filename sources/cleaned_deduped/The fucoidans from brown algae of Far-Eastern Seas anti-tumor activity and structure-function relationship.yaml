  The sulfated polysaccharides from brown algae - the fucoidans - are known to be
  a topic of numerous studies, due to their beneficial biological activities including
  anti-tumour activity. In this study the effect of fucoidans isolated from brown
  algae Saccharina cichorioides, Fucus evanescens, and Undaria pinnatifida on the
  proliferation, neoplastic transformation, and colony formation of mouse epidermal
  cells JB6 Cl41, human colon cancer DLD-1, breast cancer T-47D, and melanoma RPMI-7951
  cell lines was investigated. The algal fucoidans specifically and markedly suppressed
  the proliferation of human cancer cells with less cytotoxic effects against normal
  mouse epidermal cells. The highly sulfated --l-fucan from S. cichorioides was found
  to be vitally important in the inhibition of EGF-induced neoplastic transformation
  of JB6 Cl41 cells. In colony formation assay the fucoidans from different species
  of brown algae showed selective anti-tumour activity against different types of
  cancer, which depended on unique structures of the investigated polysaccharides.
  These results provide evidence for further exploring the use of the fucoidans from
  S. cichorioides, F. evanescens, and U. pinnatifida as novel chemotherapeutics against
  different types of cancer.'
