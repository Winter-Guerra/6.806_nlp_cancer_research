  Soy Exposure via Maternal Diet Regulates Rat Mammary Epithelial Differentiation
  by Paracrine Signaling from Stroma.md
text: '


  Diet-mediated changes in transcriptional programs that promote the early differentiation
  of the mammary gland may lead to reduced breast cancer risk. The disparity in adult
  breast cancer incidence between Asian women and Western counterparts is attributed
  partly to high soy food intake. Here, we conducted genome-wide profiling of mammary
  tissues of weanling rats exposed to soy protein isolate  or control casein  via
  maternal diet to evaluate the contribution of early exposure on mammary gene expression.
  Of the identified 18 up- and 39 downregulated genes with SPI relative to CAS, a
  subset was associated with lipid metabolic pathways, consistent with reduced mammary
  adipocyte size and suggesting stromal adipocyte-specific genomic changes. Female
  offspring of rats fed SPI tended to have fewer terminal end buds  and had significantly
  lower body weight and abdominal fat mass. To demonstrate the functional consequence
  of SPI-mediated adipocyte metabolic changes on neighboring mammary epithelium, the
  expression of in vivo regulated genes in 3T3-L1 adipocytes treated with soy isoflavone
  genistein and effects of the resultant conditioned medium  on the differentiation
  of HC11 mammary epithelial cells were evaluated by quantitative RT-PCR and/or Western
  immunoblots. In differentiated 3T3-L1, genistein decreased fatty acid synthase and
  stearoyl-CoA desaturase and increased hydroxysteroid 11- dehydrogenase 1 expression.
  CM from genistein-treated adipocytes had higher adiponectin levels and augmented
  prolactin-induced, glucocorticoid-regulated -casein levels. These findings suggest
  that soy-associated components, by targeting mammary adipocytes, alter paracrine
  signaling to enhance mammary epithelial differentiation, with important implications
  for the prevention of breast cancer associated with obesity and obesity-related
  diseases. '
