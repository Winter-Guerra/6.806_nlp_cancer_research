  Dietary lipids have a role in the aetiology of breast cancer. We have reported earlier
  that a high corn oil diet downregulates H19 and vitamin D3 upregulated protein 1
  messenger RNA expression in rat dimethylbenz anthracene-induced mammary adenocarcinomas
  in comparison with the control low-fat diet, this effect being associated with a
  higher degree of tumour malignancy. This result was compatible with the stimulating
  effect of this diet. In this study we have investigated the influence of a high
  extra virgin olive diet on H19 and VDUP1 mRNA and/or protein expression. We have
  shown earlier that this high-fat diet confers to the tumours a more benign phenotype
  in accordance with its potential protective effect on mammary cancer. We have also
  analysed the effects on the mRNA and protein expression of insulin-like growth factor-2
  , in close relation with H19, and the expression and activity of the thioredoxin
  protein, negatively regulated by VDUP1. mRNA and protein expression were analysed
  by chemiluminescent northern blot and western blot, respectively. Thioredoxin activity
  was determined by the insulin-reducing assay. The results showed that the high olive
  oil diet does not change the tumour expression of H19 and VDUP1. Moreover, tumours
  from the animals fed this diet displayed higher levels of the insulin-like growth
  factor-2 mRNAs, which are related to a higher rate of degradation or a lower traducibility.
  Finally, tumour expression and activity levels of thioredoxin-1 protein did not
  change irrespective of the diet. These results suggest that the differential effects
  of high olive oil and high corn oil diets on mammary cancer are exerted by means
  of a different, specific influence on gene expression.'
