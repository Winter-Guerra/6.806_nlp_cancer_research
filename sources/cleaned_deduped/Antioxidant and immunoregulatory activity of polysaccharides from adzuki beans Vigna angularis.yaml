text: '


  Water-extractable and alkali-extractable polysaccharides from the seed of adzuki
  beans and their three polysaccharide sub-fractions were isolated and purified by
  anion-exchange and gel filtration chromatography. AWP-1 and AWP-2 were composed
  of Rha, Ara, Man, Gal and Glu. AAP-1 was composed of Rha, Ara, Man, Gal and GalA.
  The antioxidant and immunoregulatory activities of the polysaccharides were evaluated.
  The results indicated that AWP-1, AWP-2, and AAP-1 had significant antioxidant and
  immunoregulatory activities. The results suggest that AWP-1, AWP-2, and AAP-1 have
  therapeutic implications in the treatment of inflammation and inflammatory-related
  disease.'
