  Lignans are plant-based phytoestrogens with both estrogenic and anti-estrogenic
  properties that may be important for breast carcinogenesis. Retrospective studies
  have observed decreased breast cancer risk associated with high circulating enterolactone
  concentrations, a biomarker of lignan intake, but results from prospective studies
  are conflicting. To prospectively examine this association, we measured plasma enterolactone
  levels in 802 breast cancer cases and 802 matched controls nested among predominantly
  premenopausal women in the Nurses Health Study II cohort. We used conditional logistic
  regression and polytomous logistic regression models, adjusting for known breast
  cancer risk factors, to calculate relative risks and 95 % confidence intervals.
  Compared to women with enterolactone concentrations â‰¤4 nmol/L, the multivariate-adjusted
  RRs for breast cancer were 1.18, 0.91, and 0.96 for women with enterolactone levels
  in the second to the fourth quartiles, respectively; P trend = 0.60. Results were
  similar across tumors defined by estrogen and progesterone receptor status. Among
  premenopausal women with follicular estradiol levels below the median, women in
  the highest category of enterolactone levels had a 51 % lower breast cancer risk
  compared to those in the lowest category; P trend = 0.02. No association was observed
  among women with high-follicular estradiol levels,. We did not observe an overall
  association between plasma enterolactone and breast cancer risk in a large nested
  case-control study of US women. However, a significant inverse association was observed
  among premenopausal women with low-follicular estradiol levels, suggesting that
  enterolactone may be important in a low-estrogen environment. This should be confirmed
  in future studies. '
