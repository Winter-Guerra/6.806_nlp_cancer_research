  p16 INK4a is a tumor suppressor gene, frequently hypermethylated in breast cancer;
  this epigenetic silencing of p16 INK4a occurs early in carcinogenesis. The risk
  factors and functional consequences of p16 INK4a methylation are unknown. Alcohol
  consumption, a breast cancer risk factor, impedes folate metabolism and may thereby
  alter gene methylation since folate plays a pivotal role in DNA methylation. In
  a cross-sectional study of 138 women with no history of breast cancer who underwent
  reduction mammoplasty, we studied breast cancer risk factors, plasma and breast
  folate concentrations, variation in one-carbon metabolism genes, p16 INK4a promoter
  methylation and P16 protein expression. Logistic regression was used to estimate
  multivariable-adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. p16 INK4a methylation
  was negatively correlated with P16 expression. Alcohol consumption was associated
  with lower breast folate, higher p16 INK4a promoter methylation and less P16 expression.
  Higher breast folate concentrations were associated with lower p16 INK4a promoter
  methylation. Genetic variation in MTRR and MTHFD1 was associated with higher p16
  INK4a promoter methylation, whereas variation in TYMS was associated with less P16
  protein expression. Given that this is the first study to indicate that alcohol
  consumption, breast folate and variation in one-carbon metabolism genes are associated
  with p16 INK4a promoter methylation and P16 protein expression in healthy tissues;
  these findings require replication. '
