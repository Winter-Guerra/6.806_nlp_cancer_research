  carotenoid intake is inversely associated with the risk of breast cancer among Chinese
  women.md
text: '


  The protective effect of dietary carotenoid intake on the risk of breast cancer
  is inconclusive. Moreover, data on dietary carotenoids in relation to breast cancer
  in non-Western populations are scarce. The aim of the present study was to examine
  the association between dietary carotenoid intake and the risk of breast cancer
  among Chinese women. A total of 561 cases and 561 controls who were frequency matched
  by age  and residence were recruited in the present case-control study. Dietary
  intake information was collected by a face-to-face interview using a validated FFQ.
  The OR and 95 % CI were assessed by multivariate logistic regression after adjusting
  for various potential confounders. An inverse association was observed between the
  consumption of -carotene, -carotene, -cryptoxanthin and lutein/zeaxanthin and the
  risk of breast cancer. The multivariate-adjusted OR for the highest quartile of
  intake compared with the lowest quartile of intake were 061  for -carotene, 054  for
  -carotene, 038  for -cryptoxanthin and 049  for lutein/zeaxanthin. Lycopene intake
  was not found to be associated with the risk of breast cancer, with the adjusted
  OR of 089. These inverse associations were more evident among pre-menopausal women
  and women who were exposed to second-hand smoke. The protective effect of specific
  carotenoid intake was observed for all subtypes of hormone receptor status of breast
  cancer. The present study indicated that a greater intake of specific carotenoids
  was associated with a decreased risk of breast cancer among Chinese women residing
  in Guangdong. '
