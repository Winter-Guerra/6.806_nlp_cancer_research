  Flavonoids and saponins from common beans have been widely studied due to their
  bioactivity. This research evaluated the effect of germination of black beans on
  the antioxidant capacity and antiproliferative activity against cancer cell lines
  of saponins and flavonoids extracted from seed coats, cotyledons and sprouts. Principal
  component analysis was performed to achieve punctual associations between the black
  bean saponins and flavonoids concentrations to the antioxidant capacity and the
  antiproliferative activities. Total phenolic content and antioxidant capacity of
  extracts were higher when obtained from seed coats, mainly from the 3rd germination
  day. The extracts obtained from seed coats after 3 and 5 germination days inhibited
  all cancer cell lines proliferation with no cytotoxicity against control cells.
  Genistein was related with the activity against mammary cancer cells but flavonols
  and group B saponins were more related with hepatic and colon cancers. Non-glycosilated
  flavonols were related with antioxidant capacity.'
