  of heterocyclic amines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in pork beef and chicken
  barbecued at home by Danish.md
text: '


  It is a well-known fact that, when meat is barbecued, several harmful components,
  including heterocyclic amines  and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, may be formed.
  The aim of this study was to determine the HCA and PAH content in meat  when barbecued
  at home by Danish consumers according to their normal practice. With regard to HCA,
  beef contained the highest concentrations of 9H-pyridoindole  and 2-methyl--carboline,
  while chicken contained more 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazopyridine  than pork
  and beef. The analysis of PAH showed a markedly higher concentration of PAH in beef
  compared with pork and chicken. In general, a correlation between the HCA content
  and the surface colour of the meat was found, the darker the colour the higher the
  HCA concentrations.'
