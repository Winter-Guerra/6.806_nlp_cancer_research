  Objectives To investigate the association between intake of fish and n-3 polyunsaturated
  fatty acids and the risk of breast cancer and to evaluate the potential dose-response
  relation.



  Data sources PubMed and Embase up to December 2012 and references of retrieved relevant
  articles.


  Eligibility criteria for selecting studies Prospective cohort studies with relative
  risk and 95% confidence intervals for breast cancer according to fish intake, n-3
  PUFA intake, or tissue biomarkers.


  Results Twenty six publications, including 20 905 cases of breast cancer and 883
  585 participants from 21 independent prospective cohort studies were eligible. Eleven
  articles investigated fish intake, 17 articles investigated marine n-3 PUFA, and
  12 articles investigated alpha linolenic acid. Marine n-3 PUFA was associated with
  14% reduction of risk of breast cancer, I2=54), and the relative risk remained similar
  whether marine n-3 PUFA was measured as dietary intake or as tissue biomarkers.
  Subgroup analyses also indicated that the inverse association between marine n-3
  PUFA and risk was more evident in studies that did not adjust for body mass index
  than in studies that did adjust for BMI. Dose-response analysis indicated that risk
  of breast cancer was reduced by 5% per 0.1g/day or 0.1% energy/day increment of
  dietary marine n-3 PUFA intake. No significant association was observed for fish
  intake or exposure to alpha linolenic acid.


  Conclusions Higher consumption of dietary marine n-3 PUFA is associated with a lower
  risk of breast cancer. The associations of fish and alpha linolenic acid intake
  with risk warrant further investigation of prospective cohort studies. These findings
  could have public health implications with regard to prevention of breast cancer
  through dietary and lifestyle interventions.




  Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers and the leading cause of death from
  cancer among women, accounting for 23% of the total cancer cases and 14% of cancer
  deaths in 2008.1 For the past few decades, epidemiological studies2 3 have suggested
  that a healthy diet and lifestyle is critical for the prevention of breast cancer,
  and dietary fat is one of the most intensively studied dietary factors closely related
  with risk.4 5 6 7 8 Among subtypes of dietary fat, n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids
  are the most promising types to inhibit or curtail carcinogenesis and reduce risk,
  as shown in rodent models9 10 and with in vitro cell studies.11 Results from observational
  studies in humans, however, are inconsistent. Several large prospective cohort studies,
  such as the Singapore Chinese Health Study12 and the Japan Collaborative Cohort
  Study,5 have suggested an inverse association between dietary n-3 PUFA intake and
  risk. Furthermore, several case-control studies have indicated that n-3 PUFA, measured
  as either dietary intake or with tissue biomarkers, is inversely associated with
  risk.13 14 15 16 Most of the other cohort or case-control studies, however, found
  no association between n-3 PUFA and risk.8 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 Moreover,
  accumulating prospective studies suggest that fish, the richest source of marine
  n-3 PUFA, shows inverse,12 28 29 null,5 20 21 30 31 or even positive32 33 associations
  with risk. It is therefore important and interesting to quantitatively assess the
  association between intake of n-3 PUFA and fish and the risk of breast cancer from
  the available evidence.


  We used meta-analysis to summarise the associations between dietary intake of fish
  and n-3 PUFA with incident breast cancer based on prospective cohort studies. We
  pooled risk estimates for the highest versus lowest category of intake across identified
  prospective cohort studies to examine the overall association. We conducted a dose-response
  analysis for the trend estimation and a stratified analysis to examine the sources
  of heterogeneity.






  We followed the criteria for conducting and reporting meta-analysis of observational
  studies.34 A systematic search was conducted in two databases—PubMed and Embase—up
  to December 2012. We used the following key words treated as title/abstract for
  the literature search: AND. Full details of the search strategy are in appendix
  1. Our search was restricted to studies in humans and studies published in English.
  The references of retrieved relevant articles were reviewed to identify potential
  publications. We did not contact authors for the detailed information of primary
  studies.


  Two investigators independently conducted the literature search, identified potential
  studies, and extracted detailed information from each included article. Discrepancies
  were resolved through group discussion with the third investigator. Inclusion criteria
  were prospective study design; the exposure of interest was any type of dietary
  n-3 PUFA or fish consumption or tissue n-3 PUFA concentrations; the endpoint of
  interest was incident breast cancer in women; and the risk estimate with corresponding
  95% confidence intervals of breast cancer was reported for n-3 PUFA exposure or
  fish intake. We excluded retrospective or cross sectional studies, studies in animals,
  non-original research, abstracts, unpublished studies, and duplicated studies.




  From each identified article, we extracted the first author’s name, study population
  and region, study design, duration of follow-up, age of participants, number of
  cases and non-cases, person years for the population and for each exposure category,
  risk estimates and corresponding 95% confidence intervals for each category of n-3
  PUFA or fish intake, menopausal status, method of n-3 PUFA measurement, and covariates.
  We extracted risk estimates with the most adjustment.


  Quality assessment was conducted according to the Newcastle-Ottawa criteria35 for
  non-randomised studies. A maximum of 9 points was assigned to each study: 4 for
  selection, 2 for comparability, and 3 for assessment of outcomes or exposures. We
  regarded scores of 0-3, 4-6, and 7-9 as low, moderate, and high quality, respectively.




  We used relative risk for risk estimates, and hazard ratios in cohort studies and
  odds ratios in nested case-control studies were treated as relative risks directly.
  We used log transformed relative risk and its corresponding 95% confidence interval
  from each eligible study for the meta-analysis. As different studies might use different
  assessment methods and report different exposure categories, we used the study specific
  relative risk for the highest versus lowest category of fish consumption or n-3
  PUFA exposure for the meta-analysis. We then combined the relative risk from each
  study, weighted by the inverse of their variance, for the meta-analysis with the
  DerSimonian and Laird random effects model, which takes variation both within and
  between studies into consideration.36 Studies that reported relative risk of breast
  cancer separately for postmenopausal and premenopausal women12 19 30 31 were considered
  as independent studies for the meta-analysis. Women in one study were reported as
  either premenopausal or perimenopausal,17 and thus we classed them all as premenopausal.
  One study in which only 10% of women with breast cancer were premenopausal20 was
  treated as a postmenopausal study. Most of the women with breast cancer in another
  study were postmenopausal,23 and we treated this study as a postmenopausal study.


  We conducted meta-analysis for different types of n-3 PUFA separately. Firstly,
  we estimated the pooled relative risk between the highest versus lowest category
  of fish intake, total marine n-3 PUFA, alpha linolenic acid, and total n-3 PUFA,
  respectively. For studies that did not report a relative risk for total marine n-3
  PUFA but that reported risks for eicosapentaenoic acid, docosahexaenoic acid, and
  docosapentaenoic acid separately,8 17 18 19 24 37 38 we pooled these relative risks
  to represent the relative risk of total marine n-3 PUFA exposure. One study reported
  relative risks for intake of dried and non-dried fish separately,29 and we pooled
  the two relative risks with a fixed effects model to get a summary relative risk
  for total fish intake in this study for further meta-analysis. Secondly, for marine
  n-3 PUFA, we conducted meta-analysis for EPA, DHA, and EPA separately.


  We carried out a dose-response analysis for the trend estimation using generalised
  least squares regression.39 For a study without information on the number of cases,
  number of healthy controls, or person years for exposure categories, we used variance
  weighted least squares regression for the dose-response estimation. Studies with
  fewer than three exposure categories were excluded from trend estimation. Dose-response
  analysis was conducted only in studies that reported dietary intake of n-3 PUFA
  or fish intake because the results of tissue n-3 PUFA compositions varied according
  to different tissues and units used and were not appropriate for standardisation.
  For fish intake, all the different units were transformed to g/day as described.40
  One study12 reported the unit for the fish intake category as g/1000 kcal, which
  we transformed to g/day assuming an average energy intake of 2000 kcal/day in this
  population. For dietary n-3 PUFA, we carried out dose-response analysis among studies
  with exposure units as % energy/day and g/day, separately. We did not do trend estimation
  for EPA, DHA, DPA, or total n-3 PUFA because there were limited studies with dietary
  information for these exposures. To estimate a potential curve linear association
  between fish, dietary n-3 PUFA, and breast cancer, we used a restricted cubic spline
  model.


  Study heterogeneity was estimated with I2 statistic, with values of 25%, 50%, and
  75% representing low, moderate, and high degrees of heterogeneity. Subgroup analysis
  was conducted to examine sources of study heterogeneity and the influence of potential
  residual confounding factors, such as age, body mass index, total energy intake,
  and education. Univariate meta-regression was performed to examine the significance
  of the difference in relative risks by different subgroups, including study region,
  duration of follow-up, exposure measurement, study type, menopausal status, study
  quality, risk expression, and adjustment of covariates. Sensitivity analysis was
  conducted by omitting one study at a time and examining the influence of each individual
  study on the overall relative risk. Publication bias was evaluated by visual inspection
  of a funnel plot and Egger’s regression test. We used a trim and fill algorithm41
  if possible publication bias was detected to identify and correct for the asymmetry
  of funnel plot from publication bias and provide an adjusted summary relative risk
  based on all the studies, including the estimated missing studies. Stata version
  12 was used for all the statistical analyses.






  Through full text examination of 215 potential publications we identified 26 eligible
  publications, including 20 905 cases of breast cancer and 883 585 participants,
  from 21 independent prospective cohort studies. Among these articles, 11 were from
  the United States,6 8 19 20 21 24 30 32 38 42 43 11 from Europe,17 18 23 25 26 28
  31 33 37 44 45 and four from Asia.5 12 27 29 Eleven articles described the association
  between fish intake and risk of breast cancer,5 12 20 21 28 29 30 31 32 33 42 17
  described the association between marine n-3 PUFA intake and risk,5 8 12 17 18 19
  20 21 23 24 25 26 27 37 38 43 44 12 reported the association between ALA and risk,8
  12 17 18 19 23 24 25 27 37 38 44 and 10 described the association between total
  n-3 PUFA and risk.5 8 12 18 19 23 24 25 44 45

  fatty acids and risk of breast cancer




  The 26 eligible articles were prospective cohort studies with mean follow-up ranging
  from 4.3 to 20 years. Among these, eight were nested case-control studies17 18 19
  23 24 42 44 45 and two were case-cohort studies26 37. For two cohorts, relative
  risks for fish intake and n-3 PUFA were reported in two different publications.19
  26 33 42 For one cohort, the relative risks for fish intake, n-3 PUFA intake, and
  tissue n-3 PUFA concentrations were reported in three different articles.23 25 31
  One study reported the relative risk for additional breast cancer events in a cohort
  of women who had received a diagnosis and been treated for early stage breast cancer.43
  One study reported only the relative risk for the percentage change of dietary n-3
  PUFA,6 and thus it was included only in the dose-response analysis. The average
  score for the quality assessment of included studies was 7.6, and the score for
  all the studies was 5 or above.




  Eleven studies from 11 independent cohorts reported an association between fish
  intake and risk of breast cancer, with 13 323 breast cancer events and 687 770 participants.
  Overall, fish intake was not associated with risk. There was moderate study heterogeneity.
  No publication bias was observed from the funnel plot or Eggers test.

  intake. Overall relative risk calculated with random effects model


  All eleven studies were eligible for the trend estimation. Dose-response analysis
  found no association with risk of breast cancer per 15 g/day increment of fish intake.
  No publication bias was observed. We did not find a curvilinear association between
  fish intake and risk.




  Seventeen articles from 16 independent cohort studies reported the association between
  marine n-3 PUFA and risk of breast cancer, involving 16 178 breast cancer events
  and 527 392 participants. Marine n-3 PUFA was inversely associated with risk. The
  funnel plot and Eggers test indicated slight publication bias. Trim and fill analysis,
  however, did not change the result.

  PUFA. Overall relative risk calculated with random effects model


  Eight articles were eligible for the dose-response analysis of dietary marine n-3
  PUFA and risk of breast cancer.5 6 12 20 21 25 27 43 Three studies reported marine
  n-3 PUFA as g/day,21 27 43 while the five other studies5 6 12 20 25 reported marine
  n-3 PUFA as % energy intake/day. Dose-response analysis indicated that a 0.1g/day
  increment of dietary marine n-3 PUFA was associated with 5% lower risk of breast
  cancer. A 0.1% energy increment of daily dietary marine n-3 PUFA was inversely associated
  5% reduction of risk. There was no significant curvilinear association between marine
  n-3 PUFA and risk. For studies with n-3 PUFA measured as % energy/day, however,
  we observed a significant curvilinear association.

  We then summarised the relative risks for EPA, DHA, and DPA from identified studies.
  Ten articles8 17 18 19 23 24 26 37 38 44 reported relative risk for both EPA and
  DHA, while four articles19 24 26 44 reported relative risk for DPA. There were marginally
  significant inverse associations for EPA and DHA and risk. No significant association
  was found for DPA and risk.




  Twelve articles, involving 14 284 breast cancer events and 405 592 participants,
  were included in the analysis of association between ALA exposure and risk of breast
  cancer. We found no significant association between ALA and risk and no study heterogeneity
  or publication bias. Dose-response analysis showed no significant association with
  breast cancer per 0.1 g/day increment of dietary ALA intake or per 0.1% energy/day
  increment of dietary ALA intake. No curvilinear association was observed for dietary
  ALA intake and risk.


  Ten articles reported relative risk for total n-3 PUFA and risk of breast cancer,
  and there was no significant association. Slight publication bias was observed;
  however the results remained unchanged after trim and fill analysis.




  For fish intake and ALA exposure, meta-regression and subgroup analyses did not
  show any substantial change in the summary relative risk. Exclusion of any individual
  study did not change the results. Total n-3 PUFA, however, was significantly inversely
  associated with risk only in studies without adjustment for BMI, and no association
  was observed for studies with adjustment for BMI.


  Subgroup analyses of intake of fish and marine n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and
  risk of breast cancer



  For total marine n-3 PUFA, the inverse association was present in both Asian countries
  and western countries, though it was more evident in Asian countries and no study
  heterogeneity was observed. Stratified by different measurement methods of n-3 PUFA,
  the relative risk for dietary n-3 PUFA was similar to that of tissue biomarkers,
  while study heterogeneity was much lower in studies measured as biomarkers. The
  inverse association between marine n-3 PUFA and risk was more evident in studies
  without adjustment for BMI compared with studies with such adjustment.


  For individual marine n-3 PUFA, the significant inverse association with risk of
  breast cancer was observed only in studies with shorter follow-up for EPA and 0.74
  for DHA; see supplemental table D in appendix 3), while it was not significant for
  either n-3 PUFA among studies with longer follow-up, which could be attributed to
  the limited number of studies with long follow-up. In addition, for both EPA and
  DHA exposure, their inverse associations with risk were more evident in studies
  that adjusted for BMI or education compared with studies without such adjustment.




  In this meta-analysis dietary intake of marine n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids,
  but not alpha linolenic acid, was associated with a lower risk of breast cancer.
  Fish consumption was not associated with risk. Dose-response analyses indicated
  a 5% lower risk of breast cancer per 0.1g/day or 0.1% energy/day increment of dietary
  marine n-3 PUFA, but no significant trend for ALA or fish intake. To the best of
  our knowledge, this is the first time meta-analysis has systematically and quantitatively
  evaluated the association between intake of fish and n-3 PUFA and risk of breast
  cancer.




  Ecological studies46 47 and prospective cohort studies12 28 29 have suggested an
  inverse association between fish consumption and risk of breast cancer and mortality.
  Marine n-3 PUFA are abundant in fish fat, and a few large prospective cohort studies5
  12 27 and case-control studies13 14 15 16 have reported an inverse association with
  risk of breast cancer. These findings all agreed with one meta-analysis4 based on
  studies that assessed the biomarkers of intakes of dietary fatty acids, which suggested
  a potential protective effect of marine n-3 PUFA on breast cancer. Another systematic
  review suggested that there was no protective association between n-3 PUFA and breast
  cancer.7 Further evidence has been published since then, and quite a few of the
  newly published prospective studies indicated potential protective effects of n-3
  PUFA on breast cancer.27 38 43 Our meta-analysis based on this evidence, together
  with previous publications, supports a protective role of marine n-3 PUFA on the
  incidence of breast cancer.


  Subgroup analysis indicated that the protective effect of marine n-3 PUFA was more
  evident in Asian countries than in the US or European countries. Fish intake also
  tended to be associated with a lower risk of breast cancer in Asian populations,
  rather than in western populations. This could be because typical fish intake is
  much higher in Asian populations than in western populations.48 Therefore fish intake
  in these western populations might be too low to detect an expected protective effect.
  Furthermore, in North America and some European countries, a large proportion of
  intake of marine n-3 PUFA probably comes from fish oil supplementation in the form
  of capsules, thereby contributing to the different effects on risk. In addition,
  the protective effect of fish intake might be attenuated or even reversed by other
  constituents in fish, such as organometallics and pesticides. Taken together, these
  factors could explain our finding of an overall null association between fish intake
  and risk of breast cancer, which was in line with a previous large pooled analysis.49


  Tissue n-3 PUFA concentrations, compared with dietary assessment, might provide
  a more accurate estimation of intake. Subgroup analysis for marine n-3 PUFA and
  risk, however, indicated that the summary risk estimate for studies with dietary
  information was similar to that of tissue biomarkers, which further confirmed the
  robust results of the present meta-analysis. Further concerns regarding n-3 PUFA
  and risk are menopausal status and hormone receptor status. Previous cohort studies
  indicated that the protective effect of marine n-3 PUFA against breast cancer was
  more evident in postmenopausal women than in premenopausal women.12 19 Our meta-analysis
  confirmed that n-3 PUFA intake was significantly inversely associated with breast
  cancer in postmenopausal but not in premenopausal women; this could mean that any
  benefit of marine n-3 PUFA is usually after long term exposure, which could be observed
  best at the postmenopausal period because breast cancer is a disease with a long
  latency between exposure and development. Another explanation could be related to
  the different effects of body fat on premenopausal and postmenopausal risk of breast
  cancer. One recent meta-analysis suggested that high BMI tends to be protective
  against premenopausal breast cancer but is a risk factor for postmenopausal breast
  cancer,50 and an interaction between BMI and menopausal status on breast cancer
  has been proposed. Therefore, marine n-3 PUFA could influence risk through BMI,
  which was supported by our subgroup analysis. The inverse association between marine
  n-3 PUFA and risk was greatly attenuated in studies that adjusted for BMI compared
  with studies without such adjustment. Most of the studies that investigated marine
  n-3 PUFA intake and postmenopausal breast cancer, however, did adjust for BMI, and
  an overall significant inverse association between marine n-3 PUFA and risk still
  existed in these postmenopausal studies. This suggests that the effect of marine
  n-3 PUFA on risk was partly independent of BMI, and a more precise mechanism for
  this discrepancy remains to be investigated. In addition, only a few studies examined
  the influence of oestrogen receptor and progesterone receptor status on the association
  between fish intake and risk of breast cancer. Stripp and colleagues reported an
  adverse effect of fish consumption only for oestrogen receptor positive breast cancer
  in a cohort of postmenopausal women.33 Two other studies based on large prospective
  cohorts found no evidence for the influence of hormone receptor status on n-3 PUFA
  and risk.6 8 More prospective studies are warranted to investigate the impact of
  hormone receptor status.


  In contrast with marine n-3 PUFA, the effect of ALA, a plant based n-3 PUFA, on
  breast tumour growth is less clear, and we found no significant association. The
  explanation for the inconsistency among studies regarding dietary ALA and risk of
  breast cancer could be the different dietary sources. Thiebaut and colleagues showed
  that dietary ALA from fruit and vegetables and vegetable oils was inversely associated
  with risk but observed a positive association for ALA from nut mixes and processed
  meat.25 In addition, the biological effect of ALA on breast cancer per se might
  be not as strong as marine n-3 PUFA, as suggested by the summarised relative risk
  of biomarker data with no significant association in our study. Taken together,
  we found no significant protective association with ALA, and the inconsistent associations
  observed among previous studies might reflect different dietary/food patterns involving
  other nutrients related to risk of breast cancer.


  The anticarcinogenic effects of marine n-3 PUFA are biologically plausible. Possible
  mechanisms include inhibition of eicosanoid derived from arachidonic acid, regulation
  of transcription factor activity, gene expression and activities of molecules involved
  in the signal transduction of cell growth, differentiation apoptosis, angiogenesis,
  and metastasis.51 In addition, marine n-3 PUFA could decrease the production of
  oestrogen, thus reducing oestrogen stimulated cell growth.51 Specifically, studies
  using cell lines and on rodent models have shown the protective effects of marine
  n-3 PUFA against breast tumour growth.9 10 11 52




  The present meta-analysis has several strengths. Firstly, the large sample size
  allowed us to quantitatively assess the association of fish and n-3 PUFA intake
  and risk of breast cancer, thus making it more powerful than any individual study.
  Secondly, the prospective nature of the included studies avoided the influence of
  recall and selection bias. Thirdly, we systematically reviewed and assessed the
  summarised association between breast cancer with different types of individual
  n-3 PUFA, including EPA, DHA, DPA, and ALA. These data gave a most comprehensive
  view of the association between n-3 fatty acids and risk based on the current evidence.


  The meta-analysis does, however, also have several limitations. Firstly, different
  methods of assessment were used in the included studies, and the units were heterogeneous
  across different studies. Nevertheless, we used relative risks for the highest versus
  lowest category of n-3 or fish intake, which could, to some extent, reduce the bias
  caused by different units or exposure assessment methods. Furthermore, dose-response
  analysis supports our results. Secondly, available data on the individual n-3 PUFA,
  especially DPA, is rather limited. Therefore, future prospective studies are needed
  for the detailed analysis of association between individual n-3 PUFA and risk of
  breast cancer. Thirdly, the observational nature of the included studies makes it
  subject to the influence of residual confounders. In addition, possible language
  bias could occur because we excluded articles not in English. Our eligible articles,
  however, covered a wide range of non-English countries, such as countries across
  Europe and Asia, and the number of large cohorts in other non-English countries
  is limited.




  Our findings have important public health implications. The prevention of breast
  cancer continues to be an important public health issue for researchers, especially
  with regard to the investigation of relations between breast cancer, diet, and lifestyle.
  Evidence from either experimental or observational studies suggests a protective
  effect of marine n-3 PUFA on breast cancer, though no conclusive results have been
  achieved. Systematic review and meta-analysis are the most powerful tools to assess
  these kinds of inconsistent associations. Therefore, our present study provides
  solid and robust evidence that marine n-3 PUFA are inversely associated with risk
  of breast cancer. The protective effect of fish or individual n-3 PUFA warrants
  further investigation of prospective studies.
