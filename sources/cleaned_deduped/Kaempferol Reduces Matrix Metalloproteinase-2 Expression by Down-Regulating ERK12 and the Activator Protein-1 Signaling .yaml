text: "\n\nKaempferol has been proposed as a potential drug for cancer chemoprevention
  and treatment because it is a natural polyphenol contained in plant-based foods.
  Recent studies have demonstrated that kaempferol protects against cardiovascular
  disease and cancer. Based on this finding, we investigated the mechanisms by which
  kaempferol produces the anti-metastatic effect in human tongue squamous cell carcinoma
  SCC4 cells.\n\nIn this study, we provided molecular evidence associated with the
  anti-metastatic effect of kaempferol by demonstrating a substantial suppression
  of SCC4 cell migration and invasion. This effect was associated with reduced expressions
  of MMP-2 and TIMP-2 mRNA and protein levels. Analysis of the transcriptional regulation
  indicated that kaempferol inhibited MMP-2 transcription by suppressing c-Jun activity.
  Kaempferol also produced an inhibitory effect on the phosphorylation of ERK1/2.\n\nThese
  findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms involved in the anti-metastatic
  effect of kaempferol, and are valuable in the prevention of oral cancer metastasis.\n\nCitation:

  \ are the sixth most common malignancy worldwide and the fourth leading cause of
  cancer deaths among men in Taiwan. Surgery and radiation therapy are a critical
  treatment modality in the early stage of OSCC. Despite advances in therapy, OSCC
  is still characterized as recurrent and metastasis to regional cervical lymph nodes,
  which produces poor patient prognoses. The 5-year survival rate of cancer patients
  is less than 50%, but the chances of early diagnosis and prevention of this disease
  is likely to increase if the molecular mechanism is identified. Although the cause
  of OSCC is multifactorial, metastasis, which is resistant to conventional therapies,
  is likely to be the main cause of death.\n\nDegradation of basement membranes and
  stromal extracellular matrix  components constitutes a crucial process during local
  tissue invasion and metastasis. By secreting proteolytic enzymes, tumor cells can
  create a path to migrate both locally and distantly. Matrix metalloproteinases  belong
  to a family of zinc-dependent endopeptidases that degrade several components of
  the ECM. The structure and substrate of the MMPs family allows it to be divided
  into subgroups of collagenases, stromelysins, gelatinases, membrane-type MMPs, and
  other MMPs. These are crucial to normal physiological processes, such as embryonic
  development, inflammation, angiogenesis, and wound healing. However, recent research
  has demonstrated that high levels of MMPs are often correlated with human cancers,
  such as lung, breast, liver, and oral cancers. The activities of MMPs are regulated
  by physiological inhibitors, tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases. The imbalance
  of active MMPs and TIMPs is a crucial element involved in the remodeling of the
  ECM exhibited in a number of disease states. Gohji et al. suggested that the serum
  MMP-2:TIMP-2 ratio is an independent prognostic indicator of urothelial cancer recurrence.\n\nFlavonoids
  are polyphenolic compounds that are found in fruits and vegetables. Flavonoids are
  commonly used in cardiovascular disease prevention,. In addition, previous studies
  have demonstrated that dietary flavonoids inhibit the development of various human
  cancers, such as breast cancer, prostate cancer  and colorectal cancer. Kaempferol,
  a natural polyphenol belonging to the flavonoid group, is present at high levels
  in tea, grapes, broccoli, and berries,. Several previous studies have indicated
  that kaempferol exhibits antioxidant, anti-inflammation  and anti-tumor properties.
  There are at least six different types of flavonoids. Kaempferol belongs to the
  flavonol and have a similar structure as quercein and myricetin, which also have
  anti-cancer effects. Kaempferol was discovered to inhibit angiogenesis and VEGF
  expression in human ovarian cancer cells, and the pathways involved the regulation
  of HIF-1. Kaempferol also produced an apoptosis effect through AKT expression in
  human glioma cells  and leukemia cells. Recent studies have indicated that kaempferol
  induces G2/M cell cycle arrest and autophagic cell death in human hepatic cancer
  cells. Moreover, Kang et al., reported that kaempferol and quercetin induced caspase-3-dependent
  apoptosis in oral cavity cancer cells. However, the effect of kaempferol on the
  cancer metastasis of OSCC, and the underlying mechanisms of this effect, has not
  yet been studied. In this study, we demonstrate that the suppression of metastatic
  ability by kaempferol is produced by the down-regulation of MMP-2 expression, and
  we hope to provide a foundation for further research.\n\nSCC-4, a human tongue squamous
  cell carcinoma cell line obtained from ATCC  was cultured in Dulbeccos modified
  Eagles medium supplemented with an equal volume of a nutrient mixture, F-12 Hams
  medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 g/mL streptomycin,
  and 400 ng/mL hydrocortisone. All cell cultures were maintained at 37 C in a humidified
  atmosphere of 5% CO2.\n\nSCC4 cells were seeded in 24-well plates at a density of
  5104 cells/well and treated with kaempferol at a concentration between 0100 M at
  37C for 24 h. After the exposure period, the media was removed, and cells were washed
  with phosphate buffered saline  and then incubated with 20 L MTT   for 4 h. The
  viable cell number per dish is directly proportional to the production of formazan,
  by dehydrogenases in the mitochondria within live cells, which can be measured spectrophotometrically
  at 563 nm following solubilization with isopropanol.\n\nAfter a treatment with kaempferol
  \ for 24 h, surviving cells were harvested and seeded to Boyden chamber  at 104
  cells/well in serum free medium and then incubated for 24 h or 48 h at 37C in the
  migration assay or invasion assay, respectively. For invasion assay, 10 L Matrigel
  \ was applied to 8 m pore size polycarbonate membrane filters and the bottom chamber
  contained standard medium. The invaded cells were fixed with 100% methanol and stained
  with 5% Giemsa. Cell numbers were counted under a light microscope. The migration
  assay was carried out as described in the invasion assay with no coating of Matrigel.\n\nThe
  activities of MMP-2 in conditional medium were measured by gelatin zymography protease
  assays. Briefly, collected media of an appropriate volume  were prepared with SDS
  sample buffer without boiling or reduction and subjected to 0.1% gelatin-8% SDS-PAGE
  electrophoresis. After electrophoresis, gels were washed with 2.5% Triton X-100
  and then incubated in reaction buffer  for 12 h at 37C. Then gel was stained with
  Coomassie brilliant blue R-250. Bands corresponding to MMP-2 activity were visualized
  by negative staining using 0.3% Coomassie blue in 50% methanol and 10% acetic acid.\n\nCellular
  lysates were prepared by suspending 2106/10 cm dish in 200 L of RIPA buffer containing
  protease inhibitors cocktail. Cell lysates were subjected to a centrifugation of
  10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4C, and the insoluble pellet was discarded. The protein
  concentration of total cell lysates was determined by Bradford assay. The 20 g samples
  of total cell lysates or nuclear fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE on 10% polyacrylamide
  gels and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane using the Mini-Protean Tetra
  Electrophoresis System as described previously. The blot was subsequently incubated
  with 5% non-fat milk in Tris-buffered saline  for 1 h to block non-specific binding
  and then overnight with polyclonal antibodies against MMP-2, TIMP-2 or three MAPKs
  \ with the specific antibodies for unphosphorylated or phosphorylated forms of the
  corresponding ERK 1/2, JNK 1/2 and p38. Blots were then incubated with a horseradish
  peroxidase goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG for 1 h. Afterwards, signal was detected
  by using enhanced chemiluminescence  commercial kit  and relative photographic density
  was quantitated by scanning the photographic negatives on a gel documentation and
  analysis system.\n\nTotal RNA was isolated from 1106 SCC4 cells using Trizol  according
  to the manufacturers instructions. Total RNA  was reverse transcribed into cDNA
  by SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis Supermix. The PCR was performed in a reaction
  mixture containing 2 L cDNA, 0.2 mM dNTP mixture, 2 M of each primers, 1 U Taq DNA
  polymerase, and 1-fold concentration of Thermal Pol Buffer  by denaturation at 95C
  for 5 min, followed by amplification of indicated cycles of 95C for 30 sec, 62C
  for 30 sec, and 72C for 30 sec. The specific primer sequences for these genes are
  as following: MMP-2: 5-GGCCCTGTCACTCCTGAGAT-3, 5-GGCATCCAGGTTATCGGGG A-3, and TIMP-2:
  5-GGCGTTTTGCAATGCAGATGTAG-3, 5-CACAGGAGCCGTCACTTCTCTTG-3. Quantitative real-time
  PCR analysis was carried out using Taqman one-step PCR Master Mix. 100 ng of total
  cDNA was added per 25 l reaction with MMP-2 or GAPDH primers and Taqman probes.
  The MMP-2 and GAPDH primers and probes were designed using commercial software.
  Quantitative real-time PCR assays were carried out in triplicate on a StepOnePlus
  sequence detection system. The threshold was set above the non-template control
  background and within the linear phase of target gene amplification to calculate
  the cycle number at which the transcript was detected.\n\nSCC4 cells were seeded
  at a concentration of 5104 cells per well in 6-well cell culture plates. A fragment
  of the MMP-2 promoter was inserted into the pGL3-basic vector to generate the MMP-2
  promoter plasmid. After 24 h of incubation, pGL3-basic  and MMP-2 promoter plasmid
  were co-transfected with a - galactosidase expression vector  into cells using Turbofect.
  After 12 h of transfection, cells were treated with vehicle or kaempferol  for 24
  h. Luciferase and -galactosidase activities were assayed according to the manufacturers
  protocol. Luminescence was measured using a Tropix TR717 Microplate Luminometer.
  The value of the luciferase activity was normalized to transfection efficiency and
  monitored by -galactosidase expression.\n\nAP-1 binding assays in nuclear extracts
  were performed with biotin-labeled double-stranded c-Jun oligonucleotides, and the
  electrophoretic mobility shift assay was carried out by using the Lightshift kit.
  Briefly, binding reactions containing 10 g of nuclear protein, 10 mM Tris, 50 mM
  KCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 5 mM MgCl2, 2 g poly  and 2 pmole of oligonucleotide probe
  were incubated for 20 min at room temperature. Protein DNA complexes were separated
  by electrophoresis on a 6% non-denaturing acrylamide gel, transferred to positively
  charged nylon membranes and then cross-linked in a Stratagene cross-linker. Gel
  shifts were visualized with a streptavidinhorseradish peroxidase followed by chemiluminescent
  detection. The unlabeled oligos of AP-1 at 200 were added to compete specifically
  with labeled oligo binding in the competitive EMSA.\n\nChromatin immunoprecipitation
  analysis was performed as described previously. In brief, chromatin and proteins
  from approximate 2106 cells were crosslinked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at
  room temperature. These cells were collected, lysed, and sonicated on ice to shear
  the chromatin DNA to a length between 200  1000 base pair by using Sonicator 3000.
  The sonicated chromatin lysate was immunoprecipitated with anti-c-Jun antibody,
  and collected with Protein A/G agarose beads. The protein/DNA crosslinks of the
  immunoprecipitated complexes were reversed by incubation in 0.2 M NaCl at 65C for
  4 h, and then the DNA was purified and applied to PCR as described above to determine
  the binding ability of c-Jun to MMP-2 promoter. The sequences of the primers are
  5-CTCTTTAGCTCTTCAGGTCTCAGC-3, and 5-TGTTGGGAACGCCTGACT-3.\n\nFor all of the measurements,
  analysis of variance followed by Scheffe posteriori comparison was used to assess
  the differences between control and cells treated with various concentration of
  kaempferol. A difference at p;0.05 was considered to be statistically significant
  and the experiments were repeated three times.\n\nWe analyzed the cytotoxic effects
  of kaempferol at various concentrations  on SCC4 cells by using the MTT assay. As
  shown in Figure 1, using kaempferol treatment on the SCC4 cells produced no cytotoxic
  effect on cell viability. Therefore, this concentration range of kaempferol was
  used in the following experiments.\n\nSCC4 cells were treated with various concentrations
  \ of kaempferol for 24 hours. Cell viability was determined using an MTT assay.
  The values represented the means  SD of at least three independent experiments.\n\nTo
  examine whether the cell migration and invasion were suppressed by kaempferol, we
  seeded SCC4 cells in a Boyden chamber and calculated the number of invasive cells
  in the presence of kaempferol. We observed that kaempferol substantially inhibited
  the migration and invasion of SCC4 cells in a dose-dependent manner, with only 58%
  and 56% remaining after a treatment of 100 M of kaempferol at 24 h and 48 h, respectively.\n\nAfter
  being treated with kaempferol at a concentration of 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 M,
  \ the cell migration and  cell invasion were measured using a Boyden chamber for
  24 hours and 48 hours, respectively. The values represented the means  SD of at
  least three independent experiments. p&lt;0.05 as compared with the control.\n\nTo
  demonstrate whether the suppression of SCC4 migration was mediated by regulating
  the MMP-2 expression, a gelatin zymography assay was performed. The gelatin zymography
  data indicated that MMP-2 enzyme activity was inhibited by 53% at the highest concentration
  of kaempferol. Figure 3B shows a Western blotting analysis of the MMP-2 and TIMP-2
  protein levels. The protein levels of both MMP-2 and TIMP-2 decreased substantially.
  The mRNA expression also demonstrated the same results. We also used a quantitative
  real-time PCR assay to confirm the MMP-2 mRNA expression. Thus, Kaempferol considerably
  inhibits MMP-2 mRNA expression in a concentration-dependent manner.\n\nFigure 3.
  \ Effects of kaempferol on protein and mRNA levels of MMP-2 and the endogenous inhibitor
  TIMP-2.\n\nSCC4 cells were treated with various concentrations  of kaempferol for
  24 hours. The conditioned media were collected and the activity of MMP-2 was detected,
  or a western blot with anti-MMP-2 and anti-TIMP-2 antibodies was performed.  Semiquantitative
  RT-PCR was performed to compare MMP-2 and TIMP-2 mRNA levels.  The mRNA levels of
  MMP-2 were quantified using a real-time PCR assay. The values represented the means
  \ SD of at least three independent experiments. p&lt;0.05 as compared with the control.\n\nTo
  further investigate whether the kaempferol regulated the promoter activity of MMP-2,
  we performed a luciferase reporter assay, and a reporter gene that contained the
  MMP-2 promoter region was transfected into the SCC4 cells. As shown in Figure 4A,
  the MMP-2 promoter activity was reduced in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that
  kaempferol inhibits MMP-2 expression at the transcriptional level.\n\nFigure 4.
  \ Kaempferol suppresses MMP-2 expression at a transcriptional level and on DNA binding
  activity of AP-1 in SCC4 cells.\n\n SCC4 cells were transfected with pGL3 basic
  or a MMP-2 promoter/reporter plasmid, then treated with various concentrations  of
  kaempferol. After 24-hour incubation, luciferase activities were determined and
  normalized to -galactosidase activity.  Nuclear extract prepared from SCC4 cells
  with various concentrations  of kaempferol were incubated with biotin-labeled AP-1-specific
  oligonucleotides with consensus sequence for AP-1 binding. Bound complexes were
  analyzed using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay.  Binding of c-Jun to the
  MMP-2 promoter was measured using a ChIP assay.  Representative results of c-Jun
  and c-Fos protein levels by using western blot analysis. The values represented
  the means  SD of at least three independent experiments. p&lt;0.05 as compared with
  the control.\n\nBecause previous data revealed that AP-1 was a key transcriptional
  regulator in MMP-2 promotion, EMSA and ChIP assays were then performed to investigate
  the effect of kaempferol on AP-1 DNA-binding activity. As illustrated in Figure
  4B, the binding activity of AP-1 to the MMP-2 promoter decreased significantly in
  SCC4 cells after being treated with kaempferol in a concentration-dependent manner.
  Specifically, the binding capacity of AP-1 on the promoter of the MMP-2 gene was
  repressed in SCC4 cells after being treated with 60 M kaempferol.To determine the
  transcription factors, we used a Western blot assay to detect the nuclear translocation
  of c-Jun and c-Fos. Treating SCC4 cells with kaempferol reduced the nuclear translocation
  of c-Jun, but produced no effects on the level of c-Fos.\n\nAccording to the data
  we collected, kaempferol inhibited SCC4 cell migration by reducing the MMP-2 expression.
  To further investigate the underlying mechanism of the anti-metastatic ability of
  kaempferol in SCC4 cells, we used a Western blot assay to detect the expression
  of the MAPK pathways. Figure 5A shows that the phosphorylation of ERK was suppressed
  after treating the SCC4 cells with kaempferol. However, the phosphorylation of the
  JNK1/2 and p38 pathways remained unaffected.\n\nSCC4 cells were treated with various
  doses of kaempferol  for 24 hours and whole cell lysates prepared from these cells
  were used for western blot analysis with  anti-ERK1/2,  anti-JNK1/2 and  anti-p38
  \ antibodies as described in the Materials and Methods section. The values represented
  the means  SD of at least three independent experiments. p&lt;0.05 as compared with
  the control.\n\nTo demonstrate whether the suppression of the MMP-2 expression by
  kaempferol occurred mainly by inhibiting the ERK1/2 signaling pathway, SCC4 cells
  were treated with U0126, a MEK inhibitor. The gelatin zymography data demonstrated
  that MMP-2 enzyme activity was suppressed when only treating kaempferol or U0126
  with 47% and 42%. However, combination treatment of the inhibitor with kaempferol
  intensively reduced MMP-2 enzyme activity by 78%. In addition, similar results were
  obtained from the Boyden chamber assay of cellular invasion. Figure 6B shows that
  both kaempferol and U0126 inhibit cell invasion, and treatments combining these
  two chemical compounds enhance anti-invasion activity. Therefore, the inhibition
  of the ERK1/2 signaling pathways may result in a reduced expression of MMP-2, and
  reduced tumor cell migration.\n\nFigure 6.  Effects of MEK inhibitor  and kaempferol
  on MMP-2 activity and invasion of SCC4 cells.\n\nSCC4 cells were pre-treated with
  U0126  for 1 hour, and then incubated in the presence or absence of kaempferol  for
  24 hours.  The culture media were used as subjects for analysis of MMP-2 activity,
  and cells were used for invasion assay  as described in the Materials and Methods
  section. The values represented the means  SD of at least three independent experiments.
  p&lt;0.05 as compared with the control.\n\nThe consumption of fruits and vegetables
  containing flavonoids produces vital health benefits. Kaempferol, a flavonoid, demonstrates
  diverse biological and pharmacological effects, such as antioxidant activity and
  anti-cancer-related properties,,. Our study used SCC4 oral squamous cell carcinoma
  cells, and our results indicate that kaempferol  inhibits the migration and invasion
  of SCC4 cells;  reduces the gene expression and enzyme activity of MMP-2;  decreases
  the nuclear translocation of AP-1 to the MMP-2 promoter; and  inhibits the phosphorylation
  of ERK1/2.\n\nSeveral previous studies have demonstrated that numerous phytochemicals
  use anti-metastasis abilities by suppressing the enzyme activity or gene expression
  of MMP-2,. Caffeic acid phenethyl ester inhibits oral cancer cell metastasis by
  regulating the MMP-2 and MAPK pathways. Silibinin suppresses human osteosarcoma
  MG-63 cell invasion by inhibiting the ERK-dependent induction of MMP-2. Wang et
  al observed that PAK5-Egr1-MMP-2 signaling controls the migration and invasion in
  breast cancer cells. Although TIMP-2 was the physiological inhibitor of MMP-2, our
  data indicate that kaempferol reduces MMP-2 and TIMP-2 mRNA, and protein expression.
  In previous studies, TIMP-2 overexpression reduced invasion and angiogenesis, and
  protected melanoma cells from apoptosis. Bourboulia et al. revealed that TIMP-2
  promotes an anti-tumoral transcriptional profile by up-regulating E-cadherin in
  lung cancer cells. However, de Vicente et al. demonstrated that the expression of
  TIMP-2 in oral squamous cell carcinoma was correlated with TNM staging, local recurrence,
  and less favorable survival rates. The same findings were included in the study
  performed by Baker et al. who discovered higher average levels of TIMP-2 in tumor
  tissue than in normal tissue.\n\nPrevious studies have comprehensively demonstrated
  the role of the MAPK pathway in regulating MMPs expression,,. Shan et al. indicated
  that estrogen can increase the expression of VEGF, and activate the ERK1/2 pathway
  to induce MMP-2 expression. Silibinin inhibits the invasion of oral cancer cells
  by suppressing the activation of ERK1/2 and the MMP-2 expression. Selaginella tamariscina,
  a traditional medicinal plant, possesses antimetastatic effects on human osteosarcoma
  cells by decreasing MMP-2 and MMP-9 secretions through p38 and Akt signaling pathways.
  However, our study results showed that kaempferol only inhibits ERK phosphorylation
  and no significant effects were evident on the JNK, and p38 signaling pathways.
  Indeed, as shown in Figures 56, kaempferol inhibited the phosphorylation of ERK1/2,
  and the involvement of the MAPK pathway was well-demonstrated by using the MEK inhibitor
  in SCC4 cells, thus showing that a treatment using U0126 could lead to an inhibition
  of MMP-2 secretion and SCC4 cell invasion.\n\nThe expression of the MMP-2 gene is
  regulated by the transcriptional level interaction of AP-1 with binding sequences
  in the MMP-2 gene promoter,. AP-1 is not a single transcription factor, but a heterodimer
  consisting of c-Fos and c-Jun families. Several reports have demonstrated that numerous
  drugs inhibit cancer metastasis by modulating the DNA-binding activities of AP-1.
  Hong et al. indicated that ascochlorin inhibits MMP-9 expression by suppressing
  AP-1 activity. Nobiletin, a citrus flavonoid, attenuated MMP-7 expression by reducing
  AP-1 DNA-binding activity. Our present data reveal that kaempferol decreased the
  MMP-2 activity of SCC4 cells by inhibiting AP-1 activation. This finding supports
  previous reports that indicated silibinin suppressed human osteosarcoma cell invasion
  by inhibiting the ERK-dependent AP-1 induction of MMP-2. However, we observed that
  kaempferol depresses only the c-Jun expression in the nucleus without affecting
  c-Fos. All of these results suggest that kaempferol inhibits SCC4 cell migration
  and invasion by decreasing the MMP-2 gene promoter binding activity of AP-1 transcription
  factors, including c-Jun.\n\nIn summary, our results indicate that kaempferol inhibits
  AP-1 activity, reduces MMP-2 expression, and subsequently suppresses the invasion
  of SCC4 cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated that kaempferol inhibits ERK1/2 phosphorylation,
  effectively leading to MMP-2 down-regulation. These results suggest that kaempferol
  may be a powerful candidate in the development of agents used for preventing cancer
  metastasis.\n\nConceived and designed the experiments: CWL PNC. Performed the experiments:
