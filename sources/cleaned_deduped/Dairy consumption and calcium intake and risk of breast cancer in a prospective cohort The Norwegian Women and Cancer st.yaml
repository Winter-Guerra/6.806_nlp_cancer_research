  and calcium intake and risk of breast cancer risk according to menopausal status.\n\n\n\nIn
  a population-based prospective cohort study of 64,904 Norwegian women followed from
  1996/1999 through 2006, we examined total dairy consumption and consumption of various
  dairy products in relation to pre- and postmenopausal breast cancer risk. We also
  examined breast cancer in relation to calcium intake and to milk consumption during
  childhood and performed additional analyses corrected for measurement errors in
  the dietary data. In total, 218 premenopausal and 1,189 postmenopausal incident
  breast cancer cases were diagnosed during follow-up.\n\n\n\nTotal dairy, adult,
  and childhood milk consumption was not associated with either pre- or postmenopausal
  breast cancer risk. Premenopausal women with the highest consumption of white cheese
  had half the risk of breast cancer compared to those with the lowest consumption.
  Total calcium intake tended to be inversely related to premenopausal and postmenopausal
  breast cancer. Correcting for measurement errors did not alter the results substantially,
  nor did exclusion of early cancer cases.\n\n\n\nDairy consumption is not strongly
  related to breast cancer risk in this prospective study. A non-significant negative
  association between calcium intake and breast cancer risk was seen, particularly
  among premenopausal women.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA high consumption of dairy products is
  common in many Western populations . The food group often contributes a substantial
  part of individual’s intake of saturated fat and calcium, and also vitamin D in
  areas with widespread vitamin D fortification of dairy products. Whereas saturated
  fat has been suggested to increase the risk of breast cancer , calcium and vitamin
  D—whether supplied through the diet or synthesized in the skin during sun exposure—have
  been hypothesized to decrease the risk . Also other components of dairy products
  have been proposed to influence the risk of breast cancer, e.g., an increased risk
  by environmental contaminants and insulin-like growth factors , and a decreased
  risk by conjugated linoleic acids . The fact that dairy products contain a mixture
  of components that possibly influences breast cancer risk in opposite directions
  makes the net effect of dairy consumption difficult to settle.\n\nReviews of epidemiological
  studies , a meta-analysis  and a pooled analysis of cohort studies  have concluded
  that there is no evidence for a strong association between dairy consumption and
  breast cancer risk. Positive , negative , and null findings  have been reported
  in cohort studies. Moreover, the findings may vary according to menopausal status
  \ and between various dairy products . Also for calcium intake the association with
  breast cancer is inconsistent and may differ with menopausal status .\n\nIn an earlier
  study of premenopausal breast cancer in the Norwegian Women and Cancer study, we
  found an inverse association between milk consumption and breast cancer risk . The
  age-adjusted incidence rate of breast cancer in Norway is high  and so is the consumption
  of milk and other dairy products . In the present study, we wanted to examine breast
  cancer risk and dairy consumption more thoroughly using more detailed dietary data
  from NOWAC, a higher number of breast cancer cases, and performing analyses for
  both pre- and postmenopausal women. Furthermore, as dietary data are prone to measurement
  errors we also perform corrections for such errors in our risk analyses by applying
  validation data from a sub-sample of NOWAC .\n\n\n\n\n\nNOWAC is a nationwide cohort
  study set up at the University of Tromsø, Norway in 1991. It currently comprises
  more than 165,700 women born 1927–65 randomly drawn from the National Central Person
  Register . There is a small oversampling from the three most northern counties.
  Due to practical workload, financial restraints and methodological sub-studies  the
  baseline enrollment was separated into a number of different sub-series and carried
  out from 1991 to 1997, and from 2003 to 2006. As the follow-up time for the women
  in the last inclusion period is very short, only women enrolled from 1991 to 1997
  are included in the current paper. The women received a mailed letter of invitation
  requesting informed consent and a self-instructive questionnaire focusing on certain
  topics, and also containing a number of core questions. Detailed dietary questions
  have been included in the questionnaires since 1996. To expand and update the exposure
  information, a second questionnaire was from 1998 to 2002 sent to the responders
  of the baseline mailing conducted in 1991–1997. After one or two reminders, the
  response rate for the first questionnaire was 57%, and 81% for the second questionnaire.
  The present analyses are restricted to women who gave detailed dietary information
  in the period 1996–1999, either in their first questionnaire or in their second
  questionnaire. The Regional Committee for Medical Research Ethics and the Norwegian
  Data Inspection Board approved the study.\n\n\n\nDietary information was collected
  by means of a semi-quantitative food frequency section in the questionnaire, described
  in details previously . In short, the participants were asked to record their average
  consumption of various food items during the last year ticking off fixed boxes.
  Consumption of the following dairy items was asked for: glasses of whole milk, low-fat
  milk and skimmed milk drunk per week or day, packages of yoghurt eaten per week
  or day, slices of bread with whole fat brown cheese, low-fat/skimmed brown cheese,
  whole fat white cheese and low-fat/skimmed white cheese eaten per week, and frequency
  and amount of ice cream eaten per month or week during the summer and during the
  rest of the year. In addition, the participants were asked to record what kind of
  fat they usually used on bread, and how often and how much melted or solid fat,
  full fat sour cream, and fat-reduced sour cream they used for fish meals. Number
  of glasses of milk consumed per day during childhood was recorded in most of the
  sub-series. Alcohol intake was calculated from three questions on beer, wine, and
  spirit consumption.\n\nDaily intake of foods, energy and nutrients was computed
  using a computation program developed at the Institute of Community Medicine, University
  of Tromsø, for SAS software. Missing frequencies were treated as null intake and
  missing portion sizes as the smallest portion unit in the questionnaire, giving
  a conservative intake estimate . For the women included in the analytic cohort,
  mode for missing frequencies on the 10 relevant dairy questions was zero; the median
  was two. The recorded frequency was multiplied with the recorded portion size or
  a standard portion , and transformed into daily food intake in grams. Total dairy
  consumption was calculated by summing up the consumption of all the items listed
  above, except brown cheese and fat on bread and for fish meals due to the dissimilar
  nutrient content of these items. Nutrient intake was calculated by multiplying the
  daily food intake of each item with the nutrient content of the item as given in
  the official Norwegian food composition table . Calcium intake was calculated from
  all food items in the questionnaire, excluding supplements. Vitamin D intake was
  calculated from all food items in the questionnaire including cod liver oil, but
  no other supplements. At the time of the data collection, margarine and butter were
  the only foods in Norway fortified with vitamin D.\n\n\nConsumption of dairy products
  in the Norwegian Women and Cancer study  \n\n\nThe intake of dairy foods and calcium
  was energy-adjusted by using the residual method . That is, we added the residuals
  of the regression of the intake of dairy foods and calcium on total energy intake,
  to the predicted intake at mean level of energy intake.\n\n\n\nThe reproducibility
  of the questionnaire has been examined in a sub-sample of 1,370 NOWAC participants
  . Spearman’s correlation coefficient between consumption of milk, yoghurt and cheese
  in the test and in the retest questionnaire was 0.74. The relative validity of the
  questionnaire has been evaluated against four repeated 24-h dietary recalls in a
  sub-sample of 238 NOWAC women . Compared to the registrations by the 24-h recalls,
  the questionnaire slightly underestimated the consumption of milk and yoghurt, whereas
  no significant differences were seen for consumption of cheese and ice cream. Spearman’s
  correlation coefficient between consumption registered by the questionnaire and
  by the 24-h recalls was 0.74 0.68–0.79) for milk and yoghurt, 0.42 for cheese and
  0.35 for ice cream. As for calcium, the questionnaire underestimated the intake
  compared to the 24-h recalls, Spearman’s correlation coefficient between the registrations
  made by the two methods was 0.50, 68% of the subjects were classified into the same
  or adjacent calcium quintile by the two methods, and 2% were classified in the extreme
  quintile. Parts of the questionnaire have also been evaluated against fatty acid
  composition in serum phospholipids .\n\n\n\nInformation on age at invitation was
  obtained from National Central Person Register. To handle the effect of potential
  confounding factors and effect modifying factors the following information was derived
  from the questionnaire: body weight and height, weight change since age 18, level
  of physical activity, smoking status, years of education, maternal history of breast
  cancer, mammography practice, age at menarche, number of children and age at first
  birth, use of oral contraceptives, menopausal status, and use of hormone replacement
  therapy if postmenopausal.\n\nAs only one single recording of menopausal status
  was available for the present analyses, we assigned all women who were premenopausal
  when filling out the questionnaire to be postmenopausal when they reached the age
  of 50 during follow-up. This procedure was followed for women reporting hysterectomy,
  whereas women reporting bilateral oophorectomy were considered postmenopausal throughout.
  The age of 50 as a dividing line for menopausal status was chosen based on data
  from an older sub-sample of NOWAC . Information on self-reported menopausal status
  and use of HRT has be evaluated against plasma levels of sex hormones and found
  valid .\n\nWhen checking for interactions between menopausal status and dairy consumption,
  we examined both the effect of menopausal status at the time of data recording and
  the effect of menopausal status at end of follow-up. No significant interaction
  was seen in either of the analyses.\n\n\n\nInformation from the questionnaire was
  linked to the Cancer Registry of Norway to identify incident breast cancer cases.
  In Norway, it is mandatory by law to report all incident cancer cases to the cancer
  registry, and the registry has an almost complete record of all cancer cases . More
  than 98% of the breast cancers were histologically verified. In situ breast cancers
  were not regarded as breast cancer. A corresponding linkage to records at Statistics
  Norway provided information on death and emigration. All linkages were done by means
  of the unique individual national identification number present in the cohort data
  set and in the national registers, and ensured complete follow-up.\n\n\n\nOf the
  68,517 women initially in the present cohort, we excluded 2,900 women with a prior
  cancer diagnosis, one woman with uncertain breast cancer diagnosis, seven women
  who died and three women who emigrated before the start of the follow-up. We also
  excluded 104 women who did not answer any of the dairy questions, 585 women for
  whom the calculated daily energy intake was below 2,500 kJ or above 15,000 kJ, and
  13 women with implausible age at menopause. Thus, 64,904 women were included in
  the main analyses. In addition, we performed analyses excluding women who were diagnosed
  with any kind of cancer or died during the first year of follow-up in order to avoid
  the possibility that undiagnosed cancer or other severe illness influenced the self-reported
  data.\n\n\n\nPerson-years of follow-up were calculated as the time elapsed from
  the date of the returned questionnaire to the time of cancer, to time of death or
  emigration, or to the end of follow-up, whichever occurred first. Cox proportional
  hazards regression analyses were carried out to investigate the simultaneous effect
  of dairy consumption and covariates on breast cancer incidence rate, and hazard
  rate ratios and 95% CI were calculated.\n\nVarious categorizations were applied
  for the dairy variables. The combined effect of childhood milk consumption and adult
  dairy consumption was examined by constructing a three-level variable: ‘low consumption,’
  defined as no milk consumption as a child or 1st quartile of dairy consumption as
  adult and not more than next-lowest consumption/2nd quartile on the other occasion;
  ‘high consumption,’ defined as the highest milk consumption as a child or 4th quartile
  of dairy consumption as adult and not less than the next-highest consumption/3rd
  quartile on the other occasions; and ‘moderate consumption,’ defined as all other
  combinations. The low consumption group was used as the reference category. Calcium
  intake was examined in quartiles.\n\nDifferent combinations of the covariates reported
  at cohort enrollment were employed in multivariable analyses: age at cohort enrollment,
  height, body mass index)/(ht(m)2)), BMI at age 18, weight increase since age 18
  years, level of physical activity, smoking status, education, maternal history of
  breast cancer, mammography practice, age at menarche, number of children and age
  at first birth, use of oral contraceptives, and alcohol consumption. To assess the
  influence of HRT, we conducted analysis restricted to women who were postmenopausal
  when completing the questionnaire. Further, we examined any possible confounding
  effect of intake of fruit, vegetables and potatoes, fat, and vitamin D. To adjust
  for energy intake, we categorized the women according to their energy-adjusted intake
  of each dairy variable and also added total energy intake to the model.\n\nTo test
  for linear trend in risk, we created a continuous variable by assigning ordinal
  numbers to each level of exposure and including the continuous variable in the regression
  models.\n\nInteraction effects were tested using the likelihood ratio test. The
  assumptions of proportional hazards for the exposures of interest were examined
  by log–log plots and cumulative hazard plots.\n\nTo get an idea about the effect
  of measurement error in the dietary data, we used the 24-h dietary recalls from
  the validation study to perform a measurement error correction based on the regression
  calibration method . Using the energy-adjusted dairy variables and alcohol on its
  original continuous scale, we constructed multivariate calibration models by regressing
  the individual means of the recall values of the dairy variables and alcohol on
  the questionnaire values. Information about total energy intake, age, height, weight
  increase since age 18, level of physical activity, years of education, maternal
  history of breast cancer, mammography practice, and use of oral contraceptives were
  also included in this model. This was done separately for each of the six dairy
  exposure variables. The calibration models are slightly smaller than the full models
  used in the main analyses due to the lower number of women included in the calibration.
  We excluded variables assumed not to be associated with intake of dairy products
  or alcohol. Data from 180 women were included in the calibration. This is a somewhat
  lower number than what was originally included in the validation study. The 180
  women included here are those among the 238 who are also included in the main analysis,
  so that we were able to collect background information to be used in the calibration.
  Using the publicly available SAS-macro blinplus, we then performed a measurement
  error correction based on this calibration model.\n\nAll reported p values are two-sided,
  and a significance criterion of p ; 0.05 was used to consider an association as
  statistically significant. The number of subjects included in the separate analyses
  varies somewhat due to item non-response. Statistical analyses were done by means
  of the SAS software package, version 9.1.\n\n\n\nDuring 557,753 person-years of
  follow-up, 1,407 of the 64,904 women were diagnosed with breast cancer. Two hundred
  eighteen of the diagnosed breast cancers were regarded as premenopausal cancer,
  and 1,189 were regarded as postmenopausal cancer. The mean age at diagnosis was
  56.8 years.\n\nMedian daily consumption of dairy products was 174 g, with low-fat
  milk and skimmed milk as the largest contributors. Less than 0.5% of the women did
  not consume any dairy products at all.\n\nSome characteristics of the cohort according
  to total dairy consumption are given in Table 2. Most of the known breast cancer
  risk factors did not vary noticeably across quartiles of dairy consumption. Women
  in the 3rd quartile of dairy consumption tended to have more years of education
  and a smaller fraction of them were smokers compared to women in the other quartiles.
  Both energy intake and daily intake of fat, calcium and vitamin D increased with
  increasing intake of dairy products. Dairy products were not fortified with vitamin
  D in Norway at the time of data collection, and the positive association between
  intake of vitamin D and dairy consumption can largely be ascribed to a higher proportion
  taking cod liver oil, an item very rich in vitamin D, in the higher quartiles.\n\n\nCharacteristics
  according to total dairy consumption in the Norwegian Women and Cancer study  \n\n\n\nThe
  majority of the women reported drinking 1–3 glasses of milk per day during childhood,
  27% reported drinking 4–6 glasses per day and nearly 2% reported drinking 7 glasses
  or more. Some 6% did not drink milk as a child. Both total dairy consumption and
  total milk consumption as an adult increased by increasing milk consumption as a
  child. For instance, women who reported drinking 7 or more glasses of milk as a
  child had an adult median daily intake of milk of 150 g compared to 118 g for women
  who drank 1–3 glasses and 0 g for women who did not drink milk as a child.\n\nTotal
  dairy consumption was not associated with risk of premenopausal or postmenopausal
  breast cancer either in age-adjusted analysis or after adjusting for age, energy
  intake, alcohol intake, height, weight increase since age 18, level of physical
  activity, years of education, maternal history of breast cancer, mammography practice,
  age at menarche, number of children and age at first birth, and use of oral contraceptives.
  Additional adjustment for use of HRT among postmenopausal women reduced the number
  of subjects in the model as this variable was recorded only for women who were postmenopausal
  when filling in the questionnaire and reduced the risk estimates marginally. Further
  adjustment for BMI when filling in the questionnaire and at age 18 did not contribute
  significantly to either the pre- or the postmenopausal model, nor did adjustment
  for smoking status. We also performed analyses adjusting for consumption of fruit,
  vegetables and potatoes, total intake of fat, and vitamin D intake; the risk estimates
  for pre- and postmenopausal breast cancer changed negligible. Rerunning the multivariate
  models presented in Table 3 after excluding women who died or got a cancer diagnosis
  during their first year of follow-up reduced the number of premenopausal breast
  cancer cases to n = 121 and the number of postmenopausal breast cancer cases to
  n = 733; the risk estimates were practically identical to those given in Table 3.\n\n\nHazard
  rate ratios and 95% confidence interval of invasive breast cancer according to total
  dairy consumption and calcium intake. The Norwegian Women and Cancer study  \n\n\naAdjusted
  for age, energy intake, alcohol intake, height, weight increase since age 18, level
  of physical activity, years of education, maternal history of breast cancer, mammography
  practice, age at menarche, number of children and age at first birth, and use of
  oral contraceptives\n\nOverall, intake of calcium tended to be inversely related
  to breast cancer risk, but the risk estimates and trends were not statistically
  significant. Excluding those who died or got a cancer diagnosis during their 1st
  year of follow-up and rerunning the multivariate model in Table 3 had no effect
  on the inverse trend for premenopausal breast cancer, but weakened the trend for
  postmenopausal breast cancer.\n\nLike total dairy consumption, total milk consumption
  was not associated with neither premenopausal nor postmenopausal breast cancer.
  No noteworthy changes in risk were seen when excluding cancer cases and deaths emerging
  during the 1st year of follow-up. When expressing total milk consumption in terms
  of fat from milk there tended to be an increasing risk for premenopausal breast
  cancer with increasing intake of fat from milk, whereas no association was seen
  for postmenopausal breast cancer. Rerunning the multivariate model in Table 4 excluding
  those who died or got a cancer diagnosis during their 1st year of follow-up slightly
  reduced the trend for premenopausal breast cancer, otherwise there were no changes.\n\n\nHazard
  rate ratios and 95% confidence interval of invasive breast cancer according to dairy
  food intakes. The Norwegian Women and Cancer study  \n\n\naAdjusted for age, energy
  intake, alcohol intake, height, weight increase since age 18, level of physical
  activity, years of education, maternal history of breast cancer, mammography practice,
  age at menarche, number of children and age at first birth, and use of oral contraceptives\n\nbThe
  total number of cases is reduced to 147 and 746 for pre- and postmenopausal women,
  respectively, as not all study participants were asked about milk consumption as
  a child\n\nYoghurt consumption was not associated with breast cancer. Consumption
  of white cheese showed a statistically significant inverse association with both
  premenopausal and postmenopausal breast cancer. Premenopausal women consuming at
  least 25 g cheese per day had a 50% reduced risk of breast cancer compared to women
  consuming &lt;6 g/day; for postmenopausal women the risk was reduced by approximately
  20%. The inverse associations were somewhat weakened when early cancer cases and
  deaths were excluded.\n\nMilk consumption as a child was not related to either pre-
  or postmenopausal breast cancer. Also, when combining milk consumption as a child
  and adult dairy consumption we did not observe any association with breast cancer
  risk.\n\nAs described in the “Materials and methods” section, we also performed
  a correction for measurement error based on the regression calibration method, on
  the models presented in Tables 3 and 4, except for the analysis of consumption as
  a child and as adult. The results from this correction are given in Table 5. Notice
  that these analyses are based on intake measured on continuous scale. The general
  trend is that the correction does not alter the initial findings much. The most
  substantial alteration takes place in the estimated effect of white cheese, where
  the measurement error corrected analysis shows a non-significant protective effect.
  It should be noted, however, that the uncertainty associated with the calibration
  is quite large, leading to wide confidence intervals for the error corrected estimates.\n\n\nHazard
  rate ratios and 95% confidence interval of invasive breast cancer according to calcium
  and dairy food intakes with and without correction for measurement error. The Norwegian
  Women and Cancer study  \n\n\naAdjusted for age, energy intake, alcohol intake,
  height, weight increase since age 18, level of physical activity, years of education,
  maternal history of breast cancer, mammography practice, and use of oral contraceptives\n\n\n\nIn
  this prospective cohort study, we did not find any significant association between
  total dairy consumption and risk of pre- or postmenopausal breast cancer. However,
  there was a tendency of an inverse association for some dairy products, particularly
  for premenopausal breast cancer. Total calcium intake was inversely related to breast
  cancer, whereas no association was seen for fat from milk.\n\nPrevious studies on
  dairy consumption and risk of breast cancer have been inconclusive; overall there
  does not seem to be a strong association either for total dairy consumption or for
  specific dairy items . In the present study, we saw a 50% decreased risk for premenopausal
  breast cancer among women consuming 25 g of white cheese per day compared to women
  consuming less than 6 g/day. However, we found no dose–response relationship. In
  the analysis corrected for measurement errors an increase of 5 g cheese decreased
  the risk with 24%. Four previous cohort studies  and a pooled analysis of eight
  cohort studies  did not find any significant association between cheese consumption
  and breast cancer risk, whereas in a study of Seventh-day Adventists there was a
  positive trend with increasing frequency of cheese consumption . Also, the results
  from case–control studies have been conflicting .\n\nWhite cheese can be a good
  source for calcium. The most used white cheeses in Norway typically contain about
  800 mg calcium/100 g, and cheese contributes 28% of the calcium intake . In the
  present study we saw a negative association between pre- and postmenopausal breast
  cancer risk and calcium intake. Calcium intake has been inversely related to risk
  of breast cancer in some prospective studies , although not in all . In two prospective
  studies among US women and in a small French study, calcium intake was inversely
  related to premenopausal breast cancer, but not to postmenopausal breast cancer
  . In a Swedish prospective study, pre-diagnostic calcium serum levels were inversely
  related to premenopausal breast cancer in a dose–response manner, whereas a high
  level of calcium indicated an increased risk among overweight peri/postmenopausal
  women . Further, the Women’s Health Initiative randomized trial did not find any
  reduced incidence of breast cancer among postmenopausal women who had been given
  calcium and vitamin D supplementation for 7 years . The possibility that any beneficial
  effect of calcium is modified by menopausal status is in accordance with our finding
  of a somewhat stronger association for premenopausal than for postmenopausal breast
  cancer.\n\nCalcium may exercise its anticarcinogenic properties through several
  mechanisms. In experimental studies increased concentration of calcium decreases
  cell proliferation and induces differentiation of mammary cells . It may bind and
  neutralize fatty acids and mutagenic bile acids  and may also decrease fat-induced
  epithelial hyperproliferation in rodent mammary glands . Metabolically calcium is
  closely related to vitamin D, which also has been shown to influence breast carcinogenesis,
  and it has been hypothesized that some of the anticarcinogenic effect of calcium
  may be mediated through vitamin D . For instance, calcium may play an important
  role in 1,25(OH)2D3 induced apoptosis . In Norway, dairy products were not fortified
  with vitamin D at the time of data collection, and the correlation between calcium
  intake and vitamin D intake in the present cohort was not very strong.\n\nIn our
  previous analysis of milk consumption and premenopausal breast cancer, we found
  an inverse association between the combined consumption of milk as a child and as
  an adult and breast cancer . No such association was seen in the present study.
  Also, our previous analysis showed a significant inverse trend between milk consumption
  as a child and breast cancer incidence restricted to women younger than 40 years
  at baseline. In the present study, the youngest women were 41 years at baseline.
  Childhood dairy intake was not associated with development of breast cancer in a
  65-year follow-up of the British Boyd Orr cohort , nor was childhood or adolescent
  consumption of milk or dairy products consistently significantly associated with
  breast cancer in several studies from North America . However, indications of a
  negative association have been reported in two case–control studies .\n\nOur finding
  that any weak protective effect of some dairy products and of calcium may be stronger
  or limited to premenopausal breast cancer is in accordance with previous studies
  . The mechanism for this difference is not clear. One hypothesis is that it may
  be due to the decreased level of insulin growth factors with increasing age, which
  interact with calcium in promoting growth inhibition in breast cancer cells . Another
  suggestion points to calcium’s potential as a regulator in estrogen-driven cell
  proliferation .\n\nThe strengths of our study are the population-based and prospective
  design, the large size of the cohort, the complete follow-up with regard to incidence
  of cancer, death, and emigration, the almost complete histological verification
  of breast cancer cases, and the opportunity to adjust for all established risk factors
  for breast cancer. Several questions were asked about dairy consumption and calcium
  intake was calculated from about 80 semi-quantitative food frequency questions.
  As dietary data are prone to measurement errors we performed additional analyses
  correcting the risk estimates for errors by using data from a validation study performed
  in a subsample of the cohort subjects . As mentioned, the measurement error corrections
  did not alter the initial findings much. This may be taken as an indication of robustness
  toward effects of measurement errors.\n\nPossible limitations of our study should
  also be considered. We did not have access to repeated exposure measures and to
  information on calcium supplement use, and most non-dietary exposure variables were
  self-reported for which we do not know the validity, except for menopausal status
  and use of HRT .\n\nWe used the linear regression calibration method to adjust for
  measurement error. This method relies on some assumptions about the structure of
  possible errors in the reference instrument. These errors should be random and independent
  of both true values and of the errors in the questionnaire. These assumptions may
  or may not be met in our case. In particular, studies have shown that this last
  assumption may be doubtful . This means that our method may not be able to fully
  correct for measurement error. However, we believe that using this instrument and
  method is our best option to at least gain some insight into the effects of measurement
  error in these studies.\n\nIn summary, in this prospective, population-based study,
  we found a non-significant inverse association between calcium consumption and risk
  of breast cancer. Total dairy, adult and childhood milk consumption was not associated
  with breast cancer risk, whereas a reduced risk was seen for women with the highest
  consumption of white cheese. The results seem to be robust against effects of measurement
  error. To confirm any potential protective effect of calcium and/or specific dairy
  products, more well-designed prospective studies are needed. The protective potential
  may be largest for premenopausal breast cancer.\n\n\n\nPart of the work was supported
