  Tea Consumption and Breast Cancer Risk in Japanese Women A Case-Control Study.md
text: '


  Although many in vitro and animal studies have suggested a protective effect of
  green tea against breast cancer, only a few epidemiological studies have examined
  this association, and findings have been inconsistent. We examined the association
  between green tea consumption and breast cancer risk in consideration of the hormone
  receptor status of tumors and investigated whether the association was modified
  by dietary and genetic factors based on a hospital-based case-control study in Nagano,
  Japan. A total of 369 pairs completed a validated food frequency questionnaire and
  provided blood samples. Four single nucleotide polymorphisms  were genotyped: CYP19A1,
  COMT, MTHFR C677T, and MTHFR A1298C. We found no inverse association between green
  tea consumption and breast cancer risk. Compared with women who drank less than
  120 ml of green tea per day, the adjusted odds ratio for women who drank more than
  600 ml was 1.27. We also found no inverse association for either tumor subtype.
  No substantial effect modification was observed for menopausal status, 4 SNPs, or
  dietary intake of folate or isoflavone. This study provides additional evidence
  that green tea consumption is not associated with a decreased risk.'
