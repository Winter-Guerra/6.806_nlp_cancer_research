  Consumption and Risk of Cancer a Multi-site Case-Control Study in Uruguay.md
text: '


  In the time period 1990-2004 we conducted a multisite case-control study in order
  to examine the relationship of mate consumption and risk of 13 cancer sites in Montevideo,
  Uruguay. The study included 13,201 participants  drawn from the four major public
  hospitals in the city of Montevideo. Newly diagnosed and microscopically confirmed
  cases of cancers of the mouth, pharynx, esophagus, stomach, colon, rectum, larynx,
  lung, female breast, cervix uteri, prostate, bladder and kidney were included in
  the study. Controls were drawn from the same hospitals and in the same time period
  and were afflicted by non-neoplastic conditions not related with tobacco smoking
  or alcohol drinking and without recent changes in their diets. Odds ratios for mate
  consumption was directly associated with cancers of the upper aerodigestive tract,
  esophagus, stomach, larynx, lung, cervix uteri, prostate, bladder, and kidney. In
  conclusion these results suggest that chemicals, like benzopyrene, could be responsible
  of the carcinogenic effect of mate in the above mentioned cancer sites.'
