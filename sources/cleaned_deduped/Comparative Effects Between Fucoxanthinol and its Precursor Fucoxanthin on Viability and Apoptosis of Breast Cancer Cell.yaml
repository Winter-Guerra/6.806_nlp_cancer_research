  Effects Between Fucoxanthinol and its Precursor Fucoxanthin on Viability and Apoptosis
  of Breast Cancer Cell.md

  Background/Aim: We evaluated whether low doses of the natural carotenoid fucoxanthin
  and/or of its metabolite fucoxanthinol are effective against proliferation of estrogen-sensitive
  MCF-7 and estrogen-resistant MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines. Materials and
  Methods: These cell lines were stimulated with 10 to 20 M fucoxanthin and/or fucoxanthinol,
  followed by cell viability assays, Annexin V immunofluorescence to evaluate apoptosis,
  as well as mRNA and protein extractions for changes in nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer
  of activated B cells  members expressions and nuclear translocations. Results: Fucoxanthin
  and fucoxanthinol reduced the viability of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells in a time-dependent
  manner as a result of increased apoptosis. In both cell lines, modulatory actions
  of fucoxanthinol on members of the NF-B pathway were more pronounced than that of
  fucoxanthin. Conclusion: In MDA-MB-231 cells, fucoxanthinol reduced nuclear levels
  of NF-B members p65, p52 and RelB. Fucoxanthinol and fucoxanthin could be effective
  for the treatment and/or prevention of breast cancer. '
