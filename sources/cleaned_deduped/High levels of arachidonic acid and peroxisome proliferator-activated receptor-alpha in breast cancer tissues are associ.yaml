  Fatty acids are endogenous ligands of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha,
  which is linked to the regulation of fatty acid uptake, lipid metabolism and breast
  cancer cell growth. This study was designed to screen candidate fatty acids from
  breast cancer tissue and to investigate the effects of these candidate fatty acids
  on PPARÎ± expression, cell growth and cell cycle progression in breast cancer cell
  lines. One breast cancer tissue and one reference tissue were each taken from 30
  individual breasts to examine for fatty acid composition and PPARÎ± expression.
  The cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231, MCF-7 and BT-474 were used to explore the mechanisms
  regulating cell proliferation. We found that arachidonic acid and PPARÎ± were highly
  expressed in the breast cancer tissues. AA stimulated the growth of all three breast
  cancer cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The growth stimulatory effect
  of AA was associated with PPARÎ± activation, and the most potent effect was found
  in MCF-7 cells. The stimulation of cell proliferation by AA was accompanied by the
  increased expression of cyclin E, a reduced population of G1 phase cells, and a
  faster G1/S phase transition. In contrast, AA had no effects on the levels of CDK2,
  CDK4, cyclin D1, p27, Bcl-2 and Bax. Our results demonstrate that high levels of
  AA and PPARÎ± expression in human breast cancer tissues are associated with ER-overexpressed
  breast cancer cell proliferation, which is involved in activating PPARÎ±, stimulating
  cyclin E expression, and promoting faster G1/S transition.'
