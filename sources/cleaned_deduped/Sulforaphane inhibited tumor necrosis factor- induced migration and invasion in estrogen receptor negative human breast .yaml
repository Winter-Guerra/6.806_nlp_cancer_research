  cells. Sulforaphane should be considered as a potent agent for retardation of mammary
  tumorigenesis. Keywords: breast cancer, invasion, matrix metallo- proteinase, migration,
  sulforaphane Introduction Epidemiological studies have demonstrated that consumption
  of the cruciferous vegetables cabbage, cauliflower, and broccoli is associated with
  a reduced risk of cancers, including breast, lung, and pancreatic cancer. The protective
  effects of these cruciferous vegetables against cancer are thought to be derived
  from isothiocyanates, the hydrolysis products of glucosinolates. Sulforaphane is
  a major ITC present in broccoli and other cruciferous vegetables that has displayed
  anti-cancer properties against different cancer cell lines. Sulforaphane arrested
  cell cycle progression, induced apoptosis and autophagy in different prostate cancer
  cells, inhibited in vivo xenograft tumor growth of PC-3 human prostate cancer, and
  regulated cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in colon cancer cells. In breast cancer,
  it was recently reported that sulforaphane suppressed cellular invasion of MCF-7
  estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cells via inhibition of the NF-κB signaling
  pathway and matrix metalloproteinase-9 expression. In addition, sulforaphane exerted
  suppressive activity against MMP-7 and -14 mRNA without affecting MMP-1, -3, and
  -9 in ER-negative MDA-MB-231 cells. However, the effect of sulforaphane on MMPs
  resulting in cellular migration and invasion in ER-negative breast cancer has not
  been clearly elucidated. Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer worldwide
  and is one of the leading causes of death in women. Despite successful treatment
  of primary malignancies, relapse and subsequent metastatic spread still occur through
  the bloodstream and lymphatic systems, which leads to metastasis to other organs,
  such as bones and lungs. This process requires degradation of the extracellular
  matrix in which matrix MMPs play critical roles. Elevated MMP-9 levels were reported
  to be linked with a higher degree of metastasis in many tumors, and MMP-9 deficient
  mice exhibited suppression of metastasis. Tumor necrosis factor-α has been suggested
  as a pro-inflammatory cytokine that plays an important role in tumor invasion and
  metastasis. TNF-α induced cellular migration and invasion via enhancement of MMPs
  expression and enzymatic activity in breast cancer cells. In this study, the role
  of sulforaphane in modulation Cheng Bao, Jiwon Ko, Hyun-Chang Park, Min Chae Kim,

  and invasion of MCF10DCIS.com human breast cancer cells was investigated. Materials
  and Methods Reagents and cell culture Sulforaphane was purchased from Sigma and
  TNF-α was obtained from R&amp;D Systems. MCF10DCIS.com human breast cancer cells
  were purchased from Asterand and cultured in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 5% horse
  serum, 1% HEPES, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37 oC and 5% CO 2. Cell proliferation
  assay MCF10DCIS.com cells were seeded in a 96-well plate overnight and treated with
  sulforaphane or TNF-α together with sulfora- phane at different concentrations for
  24 h. A MTT was added to each well 4 h before harvest. The supernatant was removed
  and the dark blue formazan crystals formed in intact cells were dissolved using
  dimethylsulfoxide, then the absorbance was measured at 570 nm using a microplate
  reader. Cell proliferation was described as a percentage of cell viability, compared
  to controls. RNA extraction and quantitative real-time PCR Total cellular RNA was
  extracted using Trizol reagent and reverse-transcribed into cDNA using a RevertAid
  First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit. cDNA was amplified using 5× HOT FIREPol EvaGreen
  qPCR mix Plus. Using pre-designed Taqman primers, quantitative real-time PCR was
  carried out using the ABI PRISM 7900 sequence detection system. GAPDH was used as
  an internal control. Western blot analysis Western blot analysis was performed as
  described previously. Briefly, cell lysates were separated and transferred to polyvinylidene
  fluoride membranes. Primary antibodies against MMP-2, MMP-13,, and MMP-9 and the
  secondary antibody were used. The amount of protein was quantified using EZ capture
  MG and EZ west Lumi plus. Wound-healing migration assay Wounds with a constant diameter
  were made using sterile tips, and cells were treated with different concentrations
  of TNF-α and sulforaphane. The wound area was analyzed and quantified using Image
  Pro-plus 6.0 software. The percentage of wound area was calculated by division of
  the non-recovered area at 24 h by the initial wound area at 0 h. Invasion assay
  Following manufacturer instructions, an invasion assay was performed using a BD
  Matrigel invasion chamber. Briefly, a cell suspension was inoculated into culture
  inserts and treated with different concentrations of TNF-α and sulforaphane. After
  incubation for 24 h, cells on the transwell plate were removed by scraping with
  cotton swab and the lower surface of the membrane was fixed using 100% methanol
  and stained using hematoxylin- eosin. Invading cells were quantified under a microscope
  based on counts of cells from randomly selected fields. Gelatin zymography assay
  The culture medium after 24 h treatment was loaded and separated by electrophoresis
  using a polyacrylamide gel containing 0.1% gelatin. The gel was washed with 2.5%
  Triton X-100 to remove SDS, rinsed with a 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer containing 5 mM
  CaCl 2, 200 mM NaCl, and 0.02% Brij-35, then incubated overnight at 37 oC. The following
  day, the gel was stained with a 0.5% Coomassie brilliant blue R-250 solution containing
  10% acetic acid and 20% methanol for 30 min, then destained using a 7.5% acetic
  acid solution containing 10% methanol. The gelatinase activity was determined using
  EZ West Lumi plus. Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was performed using
  an analysis of variance with SPSS. Data were presented as mean±standard deviation.
  Significance was determined when p value is lower than 0.05. Results and Discussion
  Sulforaphane inhibited TNF-α induced migration and invasion in MCF10DCIS.com human
  breast cancer cells MCF10DCIS.com cells are known to develop a comedo type of ductal
  carcinoma in situ in xenograft assays, which can progress to invasive ductal carcinoma
  after breakdown of the myoepithelial cell layer and the basement membrane. Therefore,
  MCF10DCIS.com cells are a good model for investigation of the effects of sulforaphae
  on regulation of migration and invasion of breast cancer cells. The effect of sulforaphane

  on MCF10DCIS.com human breast cancer cell proliferation. The structure of Sulforaphane.
  Cells were treated with sulforaphane at 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5, and 10 µM for 24 h. Cell
  viability was assessed using an MTT assay. Cells were treated with TNF-α together
  with sulforaphane at 1, 5, and 10 µM for 24 h. Cell viability was assessed using
  an MTT assay. Fig. 2. Effect of sulforaphane on the migration and invasion induced
  by TNF-α in MCF10DCIS.com human breast cancer cells. Cells were treated with TNF-α
  alone or together with sulforaphane at 1, 5, and 10 µM for 24 h. Migration was assessed
  based on light microscopy at 100× magnification. The injured area was compared at
  0 and 24 h. Cells were treated with TNF-α alone or together with sulforaphane 1,
  5, and 10 µM for 24 h. Invasiveness was quantified based on counts of the number
  of cells that migrated to the lower side of the filter. Data are presented as mean±SD.
  on the viability of MCF10DCIS.com estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer cells
  was examined using MTT assay. Cell viability was above 80% with sulforaphane treatments
  upto 10 µM. In addition, TNF-α alone or co-treatment of TNF-α with sulforaphane
  also exerted similar effects on cell viability after a sulforaphane treatment. TNF-α
  strongly induced cell migration and invasion in MCF10DCIS.com cells. Sulforaphane
  treatments together with TNF-α at 5 ng/mL 350 Bao et al. Fig. 3. Effect of sulforaphane
  on the MMPs activity and expression induced by TNF-α in MCF10DCIS.com human breast
  cancer cells. Cells were treated with TNF-α alone or together with sulforaphane
  at 1, 5, and 10 µM. After 24 h, the MMP enzymatic activity was assessed based on
  zymography. After 12 h, MMP-2, MMP-9, and MMP-13 mRNA expressions were determined
  using quantitative real-time PCR. After 24 h, the protein expressions of MMP-2,
  MMP-9, and MMP-13 were measured using Western blotting. Data are presented as mean±SD.
  significantly suppressed the increased cellular migration by TNF-α from 99.4% to
  68.4, 55.6, and 47.4%, respectively, compared with controls. In addition, the number
  of cells invading through the artificial matrigel was significantly reduced from
  54 cells/field for the TNF-α treatment group to 43, 34, and 23 cells/field for sulforaphane
  treatment groups at 1, 5 and 10 µM in a dose dependent manner. Thus, sulforaphane
  showed inhibition effects against invasion of MCF10DCIS.com human breast cancer
  cells. Sulforaphane suppressed MMP-2 and MMP-9 activities and reduced expression
  of MMPs in MCF10DCIS.com human breast cancer cells In breast cancer, MMPs are closely
  related to invasion and metastasis. MMP-2 expression regulated by miR-106b was reported
  to enhance breast cancer metastasis to the bone via the ERK signaling pathway. Higher
  tissue expression of MMP-9 was positively correlated to lymph node metastasis and
  aggressiveness in breast cancer patients. In addition, MMP-13 was suggested as a
  prognostic marker based a close association with tumor malignancy and poor survival
  of breast cancer patients. In this study, gelatin zymography was used to evaluate
  the effects of sulforaphane on the activities of the gelatinases MMP-2 and MMP-9.
  TNF-α significantly increased the enzymatic activities of MMP-2 and, more strongly
  MMP-9 which were suppressed by sulforaphane treatments at 1, 5, and 10 µM. Furthermore,
  sulforaphane significantly suppressed genetic mRNA expressions of MMP-2, MMP-9,
  and MMP-13 in MCF10DCIS.com human breast cancer cells, compared with controls. The
  protein expressions of MMP-2, MMP-9, and MMP-13 that were induced by TNF-α treatment
  were also significantly down-regulated by sulforaphane dose-dependently, compared
  with controls, in agreement with mRNA results. Sulforaphane exerted a regulatory
  effect on expression and enzymatic activity of Sulforaphane and Breast Cancer Invasiveness
  351 critical MMPs in breast cancer invasiveness and metastasis. In conclusion, this
  is the first report that sulforaphane, a major isothiocyanate present in broccoli,
  shows an inhibitory effect on TNF-α induced cellular migration and invasion of MCF10DCIS.com
  human breast cancer cells, which may be derived from suppression of enzymatic activities
  and protein expression of MMP-2, MMP-9, and MMP-13. Further studies demonstrating
  the underlying mechanisms of sulforaphane for regulation of MMPs and cellular migration
  and invasion of breast cancer are necessary. Acknowledgments This work was supported
