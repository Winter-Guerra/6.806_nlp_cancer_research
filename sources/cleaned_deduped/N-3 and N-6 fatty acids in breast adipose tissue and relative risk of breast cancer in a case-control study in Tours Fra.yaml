  and N-6 fatty acids in breast adipose tissue and relative risk of breast cancer
  in a case-control study in Tours Fra.md
text: "\n\nExperimental studies have indicated that n-3 fatty acids, including alpha-linolenic
  acid  and long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids inhibit mammary tumor growth
  and metastasis. Earlier epidemiological studies have given inconclusive results
  about a potential protective effect of dietary n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids on
  breast cancer risk, possibly because of methodological issues inherent to nutritional
  epidemiology. To evaluate the hypothesis that n-3 fatty acids protect against breast
  cancer, we examined the fatty acid composition in adipose tissue from 241 patients
  with invasive, nonmetastatic breast carcinoma and from 88 patients with benign breast
  disease, in a case-control study in Tours, central France. Fatty acid composition
  in breast adipose tissue was used as a qualitative biomarker of past dietary intake
  of fatty acids. Biopsies of adipose tissue were obtained at the time of surgery.
  Individual fatty acids were measured as a percentage of total fatty acids, using
  capillary gas chromatography. Unconditional logistic regression modeling was used
  to obtain odds ratio estimates while adjusting for age, height, menopausal status
  and body mass index. We found inverse associations between breast cancer-risk and
  n-3 fatty acid levels in breast adipose tissue. Women in the highest tertile of
  alpha-linolenic acid  had an odds ratio of 0.39  compared to women in the lowest
  tertile. In a similar way, women in the highest tertile of docosahexaenoic acid
  \ had an odds ratio of 0.31  compared to women in the lowest tertile. Women in the
  highest tertile of the long-chain n-3/total n-6 ratio had an odds ratio of 0.33
  \ compared to women in the lowest tertile. In conclusion, our data based on fatty
  acids levels in breast adipose tissue suggest a protective effect of n-3 fatty acids
  on breast cancer risk and support the hypothesis that the balance between n-3 and
  n-6 fatty acids plays a role in breast cancer.  2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.\n\nBreast
  cancer is the most frequent cancer among women, with an incidence rate of 88.0 per
  100,000 women in France. International variation in breast cancer incidence rates
  and changes in incidence among migrant populations have indicated that breast cancer
  risk is influenced by environmental factors, in particular diet, and therefore may
  be preventable. Among dietary constituents, data from a number of case-control studies1-4
  suggested a protective effect of a diet high in fish, but results were generally
  not confirmed by cohort studies.5, 6 A number of studies would indicate that a diet
  high in vegetables or fruits might protect against breast cancer.1, 2, 7, 8 Although
  a few studies9, 10 have failed to document a relation, the finding of a protective
  effect of vegetables or fruits is relatively consistent.\n\nThe role of specific
  food-related nutrients in the risk of breast cancer has yet to be determined. Most
  data suggest that the association between dietary fat and breast cancer may be more
  dependent on the type of fat consumed than on total fat intake.11-13 Most of the
  epidemiological studies have been concentrated on saturated fat and total polyunsaturated
  fatty acids. Limited data is available on the relation of estimated dietary intake
  of n-3 long-chain PUFA originating from fish or alpha-linolenic acid from vegetables
  to the risk of breast cancer. With regard to long-chain n-3 PUFA, no association
  has been found between estimated dietary intake14 or energy from long-chain n-3
  PUFA15 and breast cancer risk. Inconsistent data were also found for alpha-linolenic
  acid, with negative16 or positive association17 between dietary intake of alpha-linolenic
  acid and breast cancer risk. Data derived from animal experiments, however, generally
  showed that diets high in n-3 long-chain PUFA18 or in alpha-linolenic acid19-21
  inhibit mammary tumor growth and metastasis. Given the relative consistence of experimental
  data on the inhibitory effect of n-3 fatty acids, the role of these nutrients in
  the risk of breast cancer requires further attention.\n\nConclusive evidence of
  a role for individual n-3 fatty acids in breast cancer risk may be precluded by
  the many methodological limitations in measurements of dietary intake of individual
  fatty acids.22 In this regard, the use of reliable markers of relatively stable
  metabolic characteristics related to diet is of major interest. Among all biological
  markers of qualitative composition of dietary fatty acids, adipose tissue fatty
  acid composition is particularly advantageous because it reflects qualitative dietary
  intake of fatty acids on a long-term basis,23-25 thereby avoiding the potential
  bias derived from an effect of the disease on the measured biochemical parameters.
  We have previously examined adipose tissue fatty acid levels and the risk of metastasis
  occurrence in patients treated for breast cancer. We reported an inverse association
  between the level of alpha-linolenic acid in adipose tissue and the development
  of metastases, suggesting a favorable effect of alpha-linolenic acid on breast cancer
  prognosis.26 Furthermore, when we compared these patients to a population of control
  patients, we found an inverse association between alpha-linolenic acid in adipose
  fat and breast cancer, suggesting a protective effect of this fatty acid on the
  risk of the disease.27 This finding, however, remained to be confirmed, and additional
  data on the relation of long-chain n-3 PUFA  to the risk of breast cancer are needed.\n\nTo
  examine the role of n-3 fatty acids  in the risk of breast cancer, we therefore
  conducted a new, independent case-control study among 329 women treated for breast
  cancer or benign breast disease at the University Hospital of Tours in France.\n\nA
  total of 329 patients were selected for our study at the University Hospital of
  Tours, central France, between 1992 and 1996. They included 241 patients presenting
  with non-metastatic invasive breast carcinoma  and 88 patients with benign breast
  diseases. The population of control and case patients was ethnically homogeneous
  \ and lived all in a limited area of central France. Patients had surgery as first
  treatment step, during which a specimen of adipose tissue was retained. The following
  information, collected at baseline at the University Hospital, was recorded: age
  at diagnosis, height, weight, body mass index, menopausal status, as well as age
  at menarche and age at first pregnancy.  \n\nClinical characteristics of cases carcinomas
  included histologic type, tumor size, nodal status, estrogen and progesterone receptors.
  Benign breast tumors among the controls included dystrophy, inflammatory pathologies,
  papilloma, fibroadenoma, phylloid tumors  and other types of benign pathologies.
  \ \n\nA fragment of adipose tissue was removed from the lumpectomy or mastectomy
  specimen during initial surgery. This fragment was freed from epithelial breast
  or carcinoma tissue, and kept frozen in liquid nitrogen until analysis. Total lipids
  were extracted from adipose tissue with chloroform-methanol 2:1.28 The extract was
  washed with NaCl and the mixture was allowed to separate into two phases. The chloroform
  layer was transferred to a tube and evaporated to dryness under nitrogen. The lipid
  extract was dissolved in 200 l of chloroform-methanol 2:1  and directly used for
  the column procedure.\n\nTriglycerides were purified by adsorption chromatography
  on silica tubes  as follows: the column was pre-treated with 2 ml chloroform-methanol
  2:1. Then, the lipid sample was applied to the column and the tube treated with
  100 l of this same system solvent added to the column. Triglycerides were eluted
  with 20 ml of chloroform. Chloroform fractions were collected in screw-cap tubes
  with a Teflon seal. Fractions obtained were evaporated to dryness. Three hundred
  microliters of sodium methoxyde 2 N and 500 l of boron trifluoride were added to
  convert the fatty acids to their methyl esters. The mixture was incubated and shaken
  15 min at room temperature. Fatty acid methyl esters  were extracted twice into
  hexane.\n\nFor chromatography procedures, samples were analyzed in batches of 12
  that included 8 samples drawn from cases, 3 samples from controls and 1 standard.
  Samples were identified solely by a code number and ordered randomly within a batch.
  Except for the standard, the laboratory was blind to the sample origin. FAME composition
  was determined by capillary gas chromatography. The system was composed of a GC
  8000 SERIES chromatograph  equipped with an AS 800 autosampler, a cold on-column
  injector, and a flame ionization detector. A 50 m long  0.32 mm internal diameter
  fused silica column  was used. Stationary phase was a 0.25 m thick 70% Cyanopropyl
  polysilphenylene-siloxane bonded phase. Helium was used as a carrier gas at a flow
  rate of 1.5 ml/min. The detector temperature was 270C. One microliter was injected
  through the cold on-column injector. The oven temperature was programmed to rise
  from 60-170C at a rate of 15C/min and kept constant for 20 min, from 170-190C at
  a rate of 5C/min and kept constant for 10 min, and from 190-215C at a rate of 1C/min
  and kept constant for 10 min. Identification of FAME was obtained by comparison
  of their relative retention times with those of pure standard mixtures. The relative
  amount of each fatty acid was quantified by integrating the peak at baseline and
  dividing the results by the total area for all fatty acids. All integrations were
  performed by the same laboratory worker. Peaks accounting for less than 1% of total
  area, such as alpha-linolenic acid  or docosahexaenoic acid, were well detected
  and quantified.\n\nWithin-day coefficients of variation  were based on the analysis
  of one sample, aliquoted into 10 subsamples, all extracted and analyzed during the
  same day. CV ranged from 0.5% for the largest peaks to about 10% for the smallest
  peaks.\n\nClinical characteristics were compared between the 2 populations by a
  2 test or a 2-sample t-test. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated between
  fatty acid levels and some clinical characteristics of patients.\n\nAn unconditional
  logistic regression analysis was performed using SAS System.29 Odds ratios and 95%
  confidence intervals  were calculated to estimate the relative risk for tertiles
  as well as for continuous variables. Tertile cutpoints were determined by the distribution
  of fatty acids among controls, and the lowest tertile was used as the reference
  category. Potential confounding effects of age, height, BMI, and menopausal status
  \ were adjusted for in multivariate logistic regression models. Age, height and
  BMI were included either as continuous variables or were categorized according to
  tertiles. Modeling age, height and BMI in continuous variables or categorized in
  tertiles did not change substantially the estimates. In our data set, there are
  few controls, and it might lead to some unstable parameter estimates due to sparse
  numbers in some categories. Thus, only the values adjusted for these exposure variables
  as continuous were kept. Because the association of BMI with breast cancer varies
  according to menopausal status, an additional analysis adjusting for age, height,
  BMI as continuous variables, menopausal status and taking into account the interaction
  between menopausal status and BMI was performed. The estimates obtained did not
  change. Because the estimates did not change between the different adjustments,
  only the crude values and the values adjusted for age, height, BMI, menopausal status
  and BMI-menopausal status interaction were kept. Tests for trend were performed
  for the tertiles of fatty acids on the basis of the likelihood estimates. All p-values
  quoted are 2-sided.\n\nNo significant difference in the distribution of age at menarche
  and age at first pregnancy was found between patients with breast cancer and patients
  with benign breast disease. There were significant differences in age at diagnosis,
  menopausal status, height and BMI distributions of case and control patients. There
  was a higher proportion of case patients with age above 49 years or a BMI above
  22.6 kg/m2 or a height 160 cm and a higher proportion of case patients than of controls
  were post-menopausal.\n\nIndividual fatty acid levels and summed classes of adipose
  breast tissue in case and control patients are given on Table III. The major fatty
  acids in breast adipose tissue of patients  were oleic acid, palmitic acid, linoleic
  acid  and stearic acid. These fatty acids accounted for about 80% of total area
  under the chromatographic curve. For each individual fatty acid, a large variability
  between subjects was observed.  \n\nIn the whole population of patients, age at
  diagnosis was inversely associated with saturated fatty acids, 14:0, 16:0  and 18:0
  \ and positively with monounsaturated fatty acid 16:1 n-7, and with 18:2 n-6, total
  long-chain n-6 PUFA  and total long-chain n-3 PUFA. A weak inverse association was
  observed between age and 18:3 n-3. The same tendency was observed between BMI and
  fatty acid levels, with an inverse link with 14:0, 18:0  and 18:3 n-3  and a positive
  link with 16:1 n-7, total long-chain n-6  and total long-chain n-3.\n\nCalculations
  were done also for subgroups of control  and case patients. In each subgroup of
  patients, the same tendency remained as in the whole population.\n\nThe crude odds
  ratio of breast cancer according to levels of saturated and monounsaturated fatty
  acids showed that 14:0, 16:0, 18:0 and 18:1 n-9c were inversely linked to breast
  cancer-risk. When adjusting for age at diagnosis, height, BMI, menopausal status
  and the interaction BMI-menopausal status, no significant association was found
  between saturated fatty acids and breast cancer risk, except for a positive association
  between 17:0 levels in adipose tissue and breast cancer risk. Women in the highest
  tertile of 17:0 had an odds ratio of 1.41  compared to women in the lowest tertile.
  Women in the highest tertile of 18:1 n-9c had an odds ratio of 0.41  compared to
  women in the lowest tertile. Among n-6 PUFA, linoleic acid, the primary essential
  fatty acid of the n-6 series, 20:4 n-6 and total n-6 PUFA were positively associated
  with breast cancer-risk. When adjusting for the same exposure variables, women in
  the highest tertile of 18:2 n-6 had an odds ratio of 2.31  compared to women in
  the lowest tertile. This link accounts for the positive association observed between
  total n-6 PUFA and breast cancer: women in the highest tertile of total n-6 PUFA
  had an odds ratio of 2.29  compared to women in the lowest tertile. For 20:4 n-6,
  adjusted odds ratio did not show a significant association.  \n\nConsidered n-3
  fatty acids in isolation, alpha-linolenic acid was inversely associated with breast
  cancer-risk. When adjusting for age, height, BMI, menopause and menopausal status-BMI
  interaction, women in the highest tertile of 18:3 n-3 had an odds ratio of 0.39
  \ compared to women in the lowest tertile. Moreover, women in the highest tertile
  of 22:6 n-3 had an odds ratio of 0.31  compared to women in the lowest tertile.
  When considering the ratio of n-3 to n-6 PUFA, women in the highest tertile of 18:3
  n-3/18:2 n-6 had an odds ratio of 0.41  compared to women in the lowest tertile,
  and women in the highest tertile of long chain n-3/ total n-6 PUFA had an odds ratio
  of 0.33  compared to women in the lowest tertile.\n\nIn our study, we examined whether
  n-3 PUFA, including both alpha-linolenic acid and DHA, may protect against the risk
  of breast cancer. For this purpose, individual n-3 PUFA levels of breast adipose
  tissue were used as a biomarker of past dietary intake of n-3 PUFA, to investigate
  the relation between exposure to n-3 fatty acids and breast cancer. We compared
  the fatty acid composition of the adipose tissue from 241 women with breast cancer,
  and from 88 controls with benign breast tumors. We found that the level of alpha-linolenic
  acid in adipose tissue displayed a moderate inverse association with breast cancer.
  The level of DHA, and the ratios 18:3n-3/18:2 n-6 and long-chain n-3/total n-6 PUFA
  were inversely associated with breast cancer.\n\nWe reported previously an inverse
  association between adipose tissue alpha-linolenic acid level and the risk of breast
  cancer in a case-control study conducted among women treated for breast tumors in
  Tours.27 This finding, however, remained to be confirmed, and we had to rule out
  the effect of the potential methodological biases derived from the comparison of
  a population of control patients to the population of breast cancer patients previously
  used for a prognostic study and not selected during the same period. For that purpose,
  we conducted an independent study, and not an extension of the previous one,27 among
  a population of new case and control patients selected at the University Hospital
  during a subsequent period. This new study allowed confirming the inverse link between
  alpha-linolenic acid and breast cancer risk. Moreover, we also provided new data
  on long-chain n-3 PUFA, which showed an inverse association between DHA and breast
  cancer risk.\n\nThe possibility that a low level of n-3 PUFA in adipose breast tissue
  in breast cancer patients reflected a reduced dietary intake of n-3 PUFA rather
  than metabolic interactions between breast adipose tissue and breast epithelium
  deserves consideration. In a previous study, we reported in breast cancer patients
  that n-3 PUFA levels were highly correlated between breast and subcutaneous adipose
  tissue, suggesting that their levels in breast reflect the body stores of these
  fatty acids.30 In a case-control study, the relationship between dietary fatty acids
  and breast cancer has been evaluated on the basis of fatty acid levels in both subcutaneous
  abdomen and the breast sites. Our study reported that the difference in the fatty
  acid composition between sites had no relationship to breast cancer.31 Finally,
  in an animal system of chemically-induced mammary tumors, we reported a lack of
  an association of 18:3 n-3 levels in mammary adipose tissue and tumor growth.32
  This set of data suggests that a low level of n-3 PUFA as a consequence of interactions
  between carcinoma and breast adipose tissue is very unlikely.\n\nBecause samples
  of subcutaneous fat taken from different parts of the body did not show substantial
  differences within the same subject, the choice of where to take the sample may
  be based on practical consideration.24 In breast cancer patients, samples of fat
  are easily taken from the breast during surgery, allowing to avoid practical and
  ethical difficulties to obtain aspirates of subcutaneous fat from the buttocks during
  the hospitalization. The necessity of obtaining breast fat requires that the control
  group be chosen from women undergoing breast surgery, and the more practical solution
  is to consider patients with benign breast disease as hospital controls. The interpretation
  of our results might be hampered by the difficulty of considering women with benign
  breast disease as representative of the general population. Circumstantially, one
  study conducted in Finland reported that the composition of the diet in subjects
  with benign breast disease was similar to that reported for the general female population
  in some other Finnish studies.33\n\nOur case-control study has several limitations.
  As in any case-control study, the possibility of patients selection bias should
  be considered. We believe that the choice of hospitalized control patients referred
  within a healthcare network identical to that of case patients should minimize this
  bias. The main limitation is represented by the difference of age between cases
  and controls, because long-chain n-3 PUFA levels increase with age. This bias should
  not influence the results because it was taken into account as a confounder in the
  regression models used. In contrast, the potential confounding effect of several
  covariates, including education, contraceptive use, alcohol consumption and tobacco
  smoking, was not controlled for in our study population and cannot be excluded.
  Finally, the possibility that cases display adipose tissue fatty acid changes as
  a consequence of breast cancer is very unlikely as discussed above.\n\nConsidered
  alpha-linolenic acid in isolation, we interpret our results as only a weak protective
  effect on the risk of breast cancer, which was limited to the highest levels in
  adipose tissue. The strongest associations that we found were observed for DHA,
  and for the ratios 18:3 n-3/18:2 n-6 or long-chain n-3/total n-6 PUFA. In contrast
  to our findings, 2 case-control studies conducted in North America found no consistent
  association between adipose tissue n-3 fatty acid levels and breast cancer risk.31,
  34 In 1 case-control study conducted in Finland, DHA level in breast adipose tissue,
  along with its dietary intake, were significantly lower in breast cancer patients
  compared to control patients, suggesting a protective effect of DHA in the risk
  of breast cancer.33 In agreement with our findings, a case-control study conducted
  across 5 European countries found a decrease risk of breast cancer with an elevated
  ratio of long-chain n-3 PUFA to total n-6 PUFA in 4 of 5 centers.35 In our study,
  the ratio of alpha-linolenic acid to linoleic acid showed an inverse association
  with disease in one center and a positive association in three centers. These associations
  were weak  in all but one center. This set of data supports the idea that the protective
  effect of n-3 fatty acids depends on background levels of n-6 PUFA and that inhibition
  of eicosanoid production from n-6 PUFA precursors may be involved in the inhibitory
  effect of n-3 PUFA.\n\nThe reason for the discrepancy between the North American
  and European studies remains unresolved. One hypothesis is that the inconsistencies
  may be due in part to interactions between n-3 fatty acids and antioxidant compounds
  in diet, affecting their role in breast cancer risk.36, 37 Several experimental
  studies showed that the anti-oxidant vitamin E suppressed the inhibitory effect
  of n-3 PUFA  on tumor growth in different models of mammary carcinogenesis in rats38,
  39 or on the proliferation of mammary tumor cells in vitro.40 In contrast, administration
  of oxidative compounds to diets high in alpha-linolenic acid led to an inhibition
  of tumor growth in chemically-induced mammary carcinogenesis.39 These data suggest
  that the inhibitory effect of n-3 PUFA on tumor growth is mediated, at least in
  part, by increased formation of lipid peroxidation products and emphasize on the
  potential importance of the interaction of anti-and pro-oxidants compounds with
  n-3 PUFA. These recent findings may explain the lack of an association between n-3
  PUFA and breast cancer risk in the studies conducted in the United States,14, 15,
  31, 34 a country in which supplementation with anti-oxidant vitamins is a common
  practice.41\n\nAlthough we focused on the relation of n-3 fatty acids to estimated
  breast cancer risk, we also found inverse associations between the monounsaturated
  oleic acid and breast cancer. Adipose tissue levels of non-essential saturated and
  monounsaturated fatty acids are determined both by their intake from numerous dietary
  sources and by de novo endogenous synthesis and metabolism through desaturation
  and elongation pathways. Because metabolic factors influence levels of non-essential
  fatty acids in tissues, no association, or only weak association, has been reported
  between levels of saturated or monounsaturated fatty acids in adipose tissue and
  dietary intake levels.25 Epidemiological data on the association between estimated
  dietary intakes of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids and the risk of breast
  cancer are inconsistent. Results from a combined analysis of case-control studies
  reported an increased risk of breast cancer with increased dietary intake of saturated
  and monounsaturated fat in post-menopausal women42 whereas a pooled analysis of
  cohort studies showed no significant associations between saturated or monounsaturated
  fatty acids and the risk of breast cancer.43 The EURAMIC case-control study found
  a strong inverse association for adipose tissue oleic acid level, which was largely
  confined to the Spanish population.35 Thus, the significance of the relation of
  non-essential fatty acids in adipose fat to breast cancer risk remains difficult
  to evaluate.\n\nWe examined the association of the saturated fatty acids 15:0 and
  17:0 to breast cancer risk, because recent data indicated that the content of these
  fatty acids in adipose tissue might be a valid biological marker of long-term milk
  fat intake in free-living individuals in populations with high consumption of dairy
  products.44 Epidemiological data suggested a protective effect of a high consumption
  of milk in breast cancer risk,45 although other studies reported inconsistent results.46,
  47 In our population study, we found only a significant positive association between
  17:0 level in breast adipose tissue and breast cancer, which is limited to the highest
  levels in adipose tissue.\n\nWe found a positive association  between linoleic acid
  level in adipose tissue and breast cancer, suggesting an increased risk of breast
  cancer with increased dietary intake of linoleic acid. This finding, in line with
  experimental data obtained among animal models of mammary carcinogenesis,11, 48,
  49 appears to be somewhat inconsistent with recent conclusions on the role of linoleic
  acid in breast cancer risk. Although it has been suggested that long-term consumption
  of large amounts of linoleic acid might increase breast cancer risk, results from
  a meta-analysis of risk estimates from case-control and prospective cohort studies
  indicated no increased risk of breast cancer with high intakes of linoleic acid.50\n\nIn
  conclusion, our data based on fatty acid levels in breast adipose tissue suggest
  a protective effect of n-3 PUFA, somewhat moderate for alpha-linolenic acid, on
  breast cancer risk and support the hypothesis that the balance between n-3 and n-6
  fatty acids plays a role in breast cancer. Further epidemiological and experimental
  studies are needed to evaluate the potential role of the interaction of n-3 fatty
  acids with anti- and pro-oxidative vitamins and n-6 PUFA in the development of breast
  cancer.\n\nWe warmly thank N. Simonsen for criticism and helpful comments; we acknowledge
