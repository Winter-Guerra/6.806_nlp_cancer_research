  Based on the importance of early-life events in breast cancer risk, we have investigated
  the effects of high-fat diets on maturation, mammary gland development, and its
  susceptibility to transformation. Female Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a lowfat,
  high corn oil, or high extra-virgin olive oil  diet from weaning and gavaged with
  7,12-dimethylbenzanthracene. Body weight and mass increased in the HCO group compared
  to the LF group. The vaginal opening was advanced in both high-fat groups, especially
  in the HCO group. This HCO group also had increased body weight around puberty,
  more corpora lutea at post-puberty, and tended to have higher kisspeptin levels
  in the hypothalamus. Both high-fat diets induced subtle modifications in the morphology
  of the mammary gland, with no changes on -casein or hormone receptors expression
  in the gland. The HCO diet had a clearly stimulating effect of carcinogenesis, inducing
  the earliest appearance of tumors and the highest tumor incidence and yield, whereas
  the HOO diet seemed to have a weak enhancing effect, increasing tumor yield. Our
  data suggest a strong influence of the HCO diet in sexual maturation and mammary
  cancer risk, while rats fed the HOO diet were more similar to the controls.'
