  decreases breast cancer cell viability and glucose metabolism by inhibiting 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase.md
text: '


  Cancer cells are highly dependent on glycolysis to supply the energy and intermediates
  required for cell growth and proliferation. The enzyme 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase  is
  critical for glycolysis, and its activity is directly correlated with cellular glucose
  consumption. Resveratrol is a potential anti-tumoral drug that decreases glucose
  metabolism and viability in cancer cells. However, the mechanism involved in resveratrol-mediated
  anti-tumor activity is not entirely clear. In this work, it is demonstrated that
  resveratrol decreases viability, glucose consumption and ATP content in the human
  breast cancer cell line MCF-7. These effects are directly correlated with PFK inhibition
  by resveratrol in these cells. Moreover, resveratrol directly inhibits purified
  PFK, promoting the dissociation of the enzyme from fully active tetramers into less
  active dimers. This effect is exacerbated by known negative regulators of the enzyme,
  such as ATP and citrate. On the other hand, positive modulators that stabilize the
  tetrameric form of the enzyme, such as fructose-2,6-bisphosphate and ADP, prevent
  the inhibition of PFK activity by resveratrol, an effect not observed with increased
  pH. In summary, our results provide evidence that resveratrol directly inhibits
  PFK activity, therefore disrupting glucose metabolism and reducing viability in
  cancer cells.'
