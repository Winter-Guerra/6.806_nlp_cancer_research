  countries. This study was performed to evaluate the phenolic content and antioxidant
  activity of vegetables commonly consumed in Brazil using five different methods,
  namely DPPH and ABTS free radical, β-carotene bleaching, reduction of Fe3+, oxidative
  stability in Rancimat, and the chemical composition using gas chromatography-mass
  spectrometry. The content of phenolic compounds ranged from 1.2 mg GA/g to 16.9
  mg GA/g. Vegetables presenting the highest antioxidant activity were lettuce, turmeric,
  watercress and broccoli. Artichoke, spinach, broccoli, and asparagus also showed
  considerable antioxidant activity. The most frequent phenolic compounds identified
  by GC-MS were ferulic, caffeic, p-coumaric, 2-dihydroxybenzoic, 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic
  acids, and quercetin. We observed antioxidant activity in several vegetables and
  our results point out their importance in the diet. \n\n\n\n\n\nVegetables are widely
  produced in Brazil both for local consumption and export to several countries. Brazil
  is a country that presents great agro-ecological diversity and a large production
  of vegetables. Recent studies have shown the importance of vegetables in a healthy
  diet and to prevent degenerative diseases caused by oxidative stress . Vitamins
  and phytochemicals, such as ascorbic acid, carotenoids, polyphenols, and fiber have
  been regarded as the bioactive substances responsible for these effects .\n\nPhenolic
  compounds are secondary metabolites commonly found in plants, useful in the defensive
  function against pathogens and radiation, and are directly involved in the antioxidant
  activity .\n\nAntioxidants can be defined as any substance that, present in low
  concentration compared to an oxidized substrate, effectively delays or inhibits
  oxidation of the substrate . For the food industry, it is also highly interesting
  to find new and safe antioxidants from natural sources. Although synthetic antioxidants
  are very effective and stable, they have limited use in many countries due to the
  possibility of causing adverse effects on human health .\n\nSeveral techniques have
  been used to determine the in vitro antioxidant activity in order to allow rapid
  screening of promising substances and/or mixtures. In the last few years, evaluation
  of the antioxidant potential of food, as well as natural, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic
  products has been increasing. The interest on this field began to expand in the
  1990s based on the observation that many natural products have beneficial effects
  on human health. Furthermore, the research and validation of methodologies for evaluating
  the antioxidant activity in complex matrices such as food, natural products, and
  biological fluids have also been improved . Although many methods have been developed
  and tested in the literature, their advantages and limitations are still under discussion
  and no consensus has been reached to define a unique standard method capable of
  encompassing all the peculiarities exhibited by the different classes of antioxidants
  . Many methods are available for analyzing antioxidant activity, with different
  concepts, mechanisms of action, ways of expressing results, and applications . On
  the one hand, indirect methods, involving electron transfer reactions, such as ABTS•+,
  DPPH•, and FRAP, are easier to apply, but present some limitations. In this case,
  the methods evaluate the free radical scavenging ability of antioxidant compounds,
  and this does not necessarily correspond to the real oxidative degradation, although,
  in some circumstances, the donation of hydrogen atoms correlates with the antioxidant
  activity. On the other hand, according to Becker et al. , direct methods, such as
  β-carotene and Rancimat, are characterized by their ability to inhibit or halt lipid
  oxidation in model systems, based on measuring changes in the concentration of compounds
  being oxidized, on oxygen depletion, or on formation of oxidation products. Therefore,
  since these chemically distinct methods are based on different reaction mechanisms,
  it is important to use different methods in order to obtain a more thorough assessment
  of the antioxidant potential of a sample . Several analytical methods have been
  used to evaluate antioxidant activity by free radical scavenging, but besides being
  one of the fastest, ABTS•+ method also provides good solubility, which allows the
  analyses of both lipophilic and hydrophilic compounds .\n\nThis study evaluates
  the antioxidant activity properties of the main vegetables produced and consumed
  in Brazil. Antioxidant properties are determined in various test systems with different
  mechanisms of action, including antioxidant activity by scavenging abilities on
  DPPH and ABTS, reducing power test, β-carotene bleaching and oxidative stability
  by the Rancimat method. Content and profile of potential antioxidant in these vegetables
  are also examined.\n\n\n\nPhenolic compounds are responsible for the antioxidant
  activity of vegetables. Although in recent years the antioxidant analysis of vegetables
  has been extensively researched worldwide , very few studies have been carried out
  to assess vegetables grown in Brazil and consumed locally or exported to several
  countries.\n\nThe content of phenolic compounds found in our samples ranged from
  1.2 to 16.9 mg GA/g sample, in carrot and lettuce, respectively. These results were
  different from the findings reported by Chu et al. , since in their study lettuce
  was one of the vegetables that presented the lowest total phenolic content, using
  the same method. Llorach et al.  found higher levels of phenolic compounds in red-leafed
  varieties of lettuce compared to green ones. According to Gobbo-Neto and Lopes ,
  several factors such as seasonality, temperature, water availability, UV radiation,
  soil nutrients, pollution, and pathogen attack can affect the content of secondary
  metabolites in vegetables, such as phenolic compounds.\n\nAccording to the literature,
  phenolic compounds found in plants have antioxidant and anticancer activities. In
  this regard, some authors highlighted the antioxidant activity of curcumin, a naturally
  occurring phenolic compound of turmeric that is responsible for its peculiar color
  and important antioxidant and anticancer activities .\n\nThe results presented in
  Table 1 show that using the ABTS•+ method, turmeric had the highest antioxidant
  activity, followed by watercress and lettuce.\n\nThe analysis of the antioxidant
  activity of commonly consumed vegetables grown in Colorado using the ABTS•+ method
  showed that spinach and broccoli presented antioxidant activity of approximately
  50 μmol Trolox/g and 40 μmol Trolox/g, respectively, a result similar to our findings,
  of 41.2 μmol Trolox/g and 43.0 μmol Trolox/g, respectively .\n\nTurmeric and lettuce
  showed the highest antioxidant activity by the β-carotene bleaching method, while
  turnip presented the lowest result. One factor that may influence this analysis
  is the medium where the reaction occurs, characterized as an emulsion, with polar
  and non-polar regions simultaneously. Therefore, depending on the polarity of the
  sample, it can interact more or less intensely with the emulsion.\n\nThe highest
  ability to reduce Fe3+ to Fe2+ was found in lettuce, watercress, and spinach. Studying
  wild artichoke from Slovakia, Kukić et al.  reported 350 μmol Fe2+/g in dry basis
  for ethanol extracts, and 340 μmol Fe2+/g for aqueous extracts. In contrast, in
  the present study, Brazilian artichoke showed much lower ability to reduce Fe3+.\n\nThe
  Rancimat method is widely used for the determination of the oxidative stability
  of natural fats and oils. The induction period is characterized by change in conductivity
  of deionized water due to oxidation-generated products. The process is carried out
  under high temperatures and constant aeration. All vegetables tested, except the
  escarole, had a longer induction period compared to the control, with a protection
  factor and consequent antioxidant activity. The vegetables that showed the highest
  protection factors were watercress, broccoli and chives, while escarole showed no
  protection against lipid oxidation. It could be inferred that, except for escarole,
  soybean oil added to vegetable extracts required a longer time to form free radicals,
  reactive molecules that trigger the initiation phase of the oxidation process, thus
  delaying the propagation phase and, consequently, the termination phase.\n\nThe
  highest antioxidant activities by the DPPH• method were found in lettuce, artichoke,
  turmeric, spinach, escarole, and watercress.\n\nBased on the highest results using
  the DPPH• method, the IC50 of lettuce, artichoke, turmeric, spinach, and escarole
  were calculated and are shown in Figure 2. The vegetable that showed the lowest
  extract concentration to reduce the initial amount of DPPH radical by 50% was lettuce,
  followed by artichoke, turmeric, spinach, and escarole. Vegetables presenting the
  lowest IC50 values can be considered better in terms of antioxidant activity, since
  a lower concentration to reduce the DPPH free radical by 50% is required.\n\nAll
  vegetables except for escarole have considerable amounts of total phenolic compounds
  and consequent significant antioxidant activity. The correlation between them becomes
  important and is presented in Table 2.\n\nThe amount of phenolic compounds found
  in the vegetables evaluated in this study showed no direct relationship with their
  antioxidant activity using some methods. The lowest correlation between phenolic
  compound content and antioxidant activity was observed for the Rancimat method,
  whereas the DPPH• and FRAP methods showed the highest correlations.\n\nTable 3 shows
  the correlation between the methodologies used in this study to evaluate antioxidant
  activity in vegetables. The results reveal lack of consistency among these methodologies.
  This fact could be explained by the different characteristics and mechanisms of
  action of the bioactive compounds present in the samples as well as the different
  principles used to detect antioxidant properties in each method.\n\nThe best correlations
  were found for DPPH• vs. FRAP and ABTS•+ vs. FRAP, while the Rancimat vs. FRAP did
  not show a good correlation. The method that best correlated with Rancimat was β-caroten,
  both considered direct methods.\n\nTherefore, despite the difficulty to choose the
  most appropriate method for the evaluation of antioxidant activity, the most commonly
  accepted, validated, and standardized methods, with more information available should
  be chosen.\n\nThe results of the phenolic composition obtained using GC-MS are presented
  in Table 4. Several compounds derived from benzoic acid and from cinnamic acid were
  found. The most abundant phenolic compound derived from cinnamic acid present in
  the samples assessed in this study was caffeic acid, and spinach showed the greatest
  amount of this compound.\n\nRegarding flavonoids, quercetin was found in lettuce,
  chicory, asparagus chives and snap beans and kaempferol in chives, snap beans, and
  escarole, already known for its high antioxidant activity. Llorach et al.  detected
  luteolin and quercetin derivatives in lettuce, in amounts that varied according
  to the cultivar. DuPont et al.  analyzed the flavonoids of Cichorium endivia in
  the United Kingdom, and also identified the presence of kaempferol, corroborating
  the results found in this work.\n\nThe ascorbic acid identified in some of our samples
  may have contributed to the antioxidant activity of vegetables, such as in the cases
  of broccoli, cabbage, chives, parsley, rocket, and watercress, since this is a compound
  with high electron donation capacity.\n\n\n\n\n\nGallic acid, 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazine,
  2,2′-azinobis-3-ethylbenzotiazoline-6-sulfonic acid, β-carotene, linoleic acid,
  ferric chloride, ferrous sulfate, tripyridyltriazine, N-methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide,
  and standards for GC-MS were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The other reagents were
  purchased from local sources. The cartridges used for SPE-LC18 chromatographic analysis
  were obtained from Supelco.\n\n\n\nAll the vegetables used were produced in the
  São Paulo State, in Southeastern Brazil, wet tropical climate, 22°43′31″ S and 47°38′57″
  W, from January to October. The following vegetable species were assessed: artichoke;
  asparagus; broccoli; cabbage; carrot; celery; chicory; chives; cucumber; escarole;
  leek; lettuce; parsley Nym.); pumpkin; radish; red beet; rocket; snap beans; spinach;
  Swiss chard; turmeric; turnip; watercress.\n\nThe extraction of the compounds of
  interest from the vegetable samples was performed according to the method described
  by Kähkönen et al.  with some modifications. Samples were first frozen at −18 °C
  and then lyophilised. After that, the material was ground and 1 g of each vegetable
  powder was placed in Falcon tubes, mixed with 20 mL of 80% ethanol, and shaken thoroughly.
  Subsequently, the tubes were sonicated for 5 min, centrifuged for 15 min at 5000×
  g, and the supernatant collected for analysis. All samples were extracted in triplicate.\n\n\n\nTotal
  phenolic content analysis was performed using the Folin Ciocalteau spectrophotometric
  method described by Singleton et al. . The vegetable extracts were diluted in ethanol
  80% and 0.5 mL of the solution obtained was transferred to a tube with 2.5 mL of
  Folin Ciocalteau reagent diluted in water at 1:10. The mixture was allowed to sit
  for 3–8 min, then 2 mL of sodium carbonate 4% was added, and the tubes were kept
  in the dark for 2 h. Afterwards, the absorbance was measured at 740 nm using a UV-mini
  1240 spectrophotometer. A blank test was also performed under the same conditions
  and the results of total phenolic compounds were expressed as gallic acid equivalent,
  based on a calibration curve of gallic acid in the concentration range of 5 to 80
  μg/mL.\n\n\n\nThe reaction mixture consisted of 0.5 mL of standards or vegetable
  extracts, 3.0 mL of pure ethanol, and 0.3 mL of DPPH radical in ethanol solution
  0.5 mM, which was incubated at room temperature for 45 min, and the activity was
  expressed in μmol Trolox/g of sample DW . The calibration curve was constructed
  with the standard Trolox in the concentration range of 0 to 200 μM Trolox.\n\nSeveral
  vegetable extract concentrations were used, and readings were monitored at 517 nm,
  using a UV-mini 1240 spectrophotometer, every 20 min for 140 or 160 min, depending
  on the sample, until a constant reading was obtained. The antioxidant activity measured
  by DPPH free radical method can be expressed as IC50, i.e., the antioxidant concentration
  required to reduce the initial DPPH radical by 50%. The concentration of vegetable
  samples required to reduce the initial DPPH radical by 50% is expressed in mg/mL.\n\n\n\nThe
  antioxidant activity assessment was performed according to the method described
  by Emmons et al.  with some modifications. An emulsion was prepared by dissolving
  10 mg of β-carotene in 100 mL of chloroform PA and aliquots of 3 mL were added to
  40 mg of linoleic acid and 400 mg of Tween 40. The chloroform was removed using
  a stream of nitrogen and the residue obtained was redissolved in 100 mL of water
  aerated for 30 min. Aliquots of 3 mL of the resultant β-carotene/linoleic acid emulsion
  were mixed with 50 μL of the vegetable extracts and incubated in a water bath at
  50 °C. The emulsion oxidation was monitored using a UV-mini 1240 spectrophotometer
  at 470 nm, at baseline and at 20-min intervals for 2 h. Control samples contained
  only solvent in place of the vegetable extracts. BHT and α-tocopherol were used
  as reference standards. The antioxidant activity was expressed as percentage of
  relative inhibition compared to control samples after 120 min and calculated as:\n\n\nwhere
  AA = antioxidant activity; DRc = control degradation rate/120); DRs = degradation
  rate in the presence of standard or vegetable extract/120); a = absorbance at initial
  time; b = absorbance at final time.\n\n\n\nThe antioxidant activity by the ABTS•+
  method was assessed according to the method described by Re et al.  with modifications.
  The ABTS radical was formed through the reaction of ABTS•+ solution 7 mM with potassium
  persulfate solution 140 mM, incubated at 25 °C in the dark for 12–16 h. Once formed,
  the radical was diluted with ethanol P.A. to an absorbance of 0.700 ± 0.020 at 734
  nm. Three different dilutions of each vegetable extract were prepared in triplicate.
  After that, 30 μL of each vegetable extract dilution were transferred to test tubes
  with 3.0 mL of ABTS radical in the dark. The absorbance was read at 734 nm after
  6 min of the reaction using ethanol as a blank. Trolox, a synthetic water-soluble
  antioxidant analogue of vitamin E, was used as reference at concentrations ranging
  from 100 to 2000 μM and the results were expressed as μM Trolox/g sample.\n\n\n\nTo
  determine the antioxidant activity by iron reduction, using the ferric reducing
  antioxidant power assay, we followed the methodology described by Benzie and Strain
  \ with some modifications. FRAP measures the ferric reducing ability of the samples,
  in acidic medium, forming an intense blue color as the ferric tripyridyltriazine
  complex is reduced to the ferrous form. FRAP reagent was prepared immediately before
  analysis by mixing 25 mL of acetate buffer, 2.5 mL of TPTZ solution, and 2.5 mL
  of FeCl3 in aqueous solution. An aliquot of 100 μL of the vegetable extracts was
  added to 3 mL of FRAP reagent and incubated in a water bath at 37 °C for 30 min.
  After this time, the absorbance was measured using a UV-mini 1240 spectrophotometer
  that was reset with FRAP solution. The calibration curve was constructed using ferrous
  sulfate and the results were expressed in μmol Fe2+/mg.\n\n\n\nSamples of 5 g of
  pure soybean oil were mixed with the vegetable extracts at a concentration of 100
  ppm, based on the content of phenolic compounds. The oxidative stability index of
  this mixture was measured by the Rancimat method according to AOCS Cd 12b-92  at
  110 ± 1 °C and a flow rate of 9 L/h of dry air, using 743 Rancimat. The conductivity
  increase due to the accumulation of oxidized compounds plotted as a function of
  the reaction time allowed the construction of the curve and the calculation of the
  induction period. A control was prepared with pure soybean oil without added antioxidants
  and samples containing synthetic antioxidant BHT were also submitted to this analysis.\n\n\n\nwhere
  PF = protection factor; PIa = IP of the oil with the vegetable extracts or standards;
  Plc = IP of the control.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Solid Phase Extraction technique was employed
  for the removal of sugars, which could mask the compounds of interest. This technique
  has been increasingly used because it is quick, efficient, and requires very small
  volumes of samples and solvents. LC-18 SPE cartridges were conditioned with methanol
  and acidic water. Subsequently, 4 mL of each vegetable ethanol extract once again
  evaporated and redissolved in 4 mL of water were added to their respective cartridges.
  After the vegetable extract completely passed through, the column was washed with
  sufficient acidic water to remove the sugars. Compounds of interest were eluted
  with methanol into coded glass vials and their bands were identified under UV light.\n\n\n\nPrior
  to the GC-MS analysis, the samples were submitted to a crucial stage called derivatization.
  GC-MS is only useful for the analysis of gases, volatile, and thermally stable substances.
  Samples not showing this profile, presenting high molecular weight compounds and/or
  strongly polar functional groups, require a derivatization procedure, a reaction
  which transforms a substance of interest into a product of similar chemical structure,
  called a derivative, presenting characteristics suitable for analysis . Chemical
  derivatization is widely used to reduce the polarity of functional groups and facilitate
  their separation during GC-MS analysis.\n\nThe fractions obtained after purification
  were added to 100 μL of derivatizing reagent MSTFA. The reaction mixture was homogenized
  and incubated at 70 °C for 10 min. The reagent was evaporated under a stream of
  nitrogen and trimethylsilyl derivatives were rediluted in hexane. After homogenization,
  the supernatant was transferred to a vial and injected into the GC-MS system.\n\n\n\nGC-MS
  analyses of the vegetable extracts were performed on a gas chromatograph GC 2010
  coupled to a mass spectrometer QP 2010 Plus. Derivatized samples were separated
  using a capillary column. The temperature program started at 80 °C, increasing at
  20 °C/min to 250 °C, remaining at 250 °C for 1 min, increasing at 6 °C/min to 300
  °C, remaining at 300 °C for 5 min, increasing at 15 °C/min to 310 °C, remaining
  at 310 °C for 5 min, increasing at 20 °C/min to the final temperature of 320 °C,
  remaining at 320 °C for 10 min, totaling 40 min of analysis. Helium was used as
  the carrier gas, the injector temperature was 280 °C, and the injection volume was
  0.5 μL in splitless mode. The interface was maintained at 280 °C and the detector
  was operated in the scanning mode. Data integration was performed using the LabSolutions-GCMS
  software. Flavonoids, phenolic acids, and derivatives were identified by comparing
  their retention time and ion fragmentation with coded and authentic standards eluted
  under the same conditions as well as with the Wiley Version 8 library.\n\n\n\nThe
  results obtained were statistically analyzed using the SAS software  and the analysis
  of variance using the general linear models procedure. The Tukey test at 5% probability
  was used for mean comparison.\n\n\n\nThe amount of phenolic compounds present in
  the vegetables analyzed showed no direct relationship with the antioxidant activity
  in a large number of samples. Based on this finding, it is possible to affirm that
  different phenolic compounds and some non-phenolic substances present different
  antioxidant activities, and that the presence of high levels of certain classes
  of compounds in vegetables does not always guarantee higher antioxidant power. The
  highest correlation of the amount of phenolic compounds was found using the DPPH•
  method. Lettuce, turmeric, watercress, and broccoli presented the highest antioxidant
  activity among the Brazilian vegetables analyzed.\n\nThe samples did not present
  the same results in all methodologies and no defined order of antioxidant activity
  could be found. One possible explanation for this could be the difference in the
  chemical composition of vegetables and different mediums and principles of analyses.
  Due to the great chemical diversity of the compounds found in this study, the use
  of more than one method is more suitable for the analysis of in vitro antioxidant
  activity of these vegetables.\n\nSeveral phenolic compounds with high antioxidant
  activity could be identified using GC-MS in vegetables, mainly phenolic acids, some
  of them present in high concentrations, such as caffeic acid in spinach, chicory,
  and escarole.\n\n\n\nThe authors thank Solange G. C. Brazaca for her assistance
