  Although soil characteristics modulate metal mobility and bioavailability to organisms,
  they are often ignored in the risk assessment of metal transfer. This paper aims
  to determine the ability of chemical methods to assess and predict cadmium, lead  and
  zinc  environmental bioavailability to the land snail Cantareus aspersus. Snails
  were exposed in the laboratory for 28 days to 17 soils from around a former smelter.
  The soils were selected for their range of pH, organic matter, clay content, and
  Cd, Pb and Zn concentrations. The influence of soil properties on environmental
  availability, EDTA, CaCl, NHNO, NaNO, free ion activity and total dissolved metal
  concentration in soil solution) and on environmental bioavailability  was identified.
  Among the seven chemical methods, only the EDTA and the total soil concentration
  can be used to assess Cd and Pb environmental bioavailability to snails =0.67 and
  0.77, respectively). For Zn, none of the chemical methods were suitable. Taking
  into account the influence of the soil characteristics  allows a better prediction
  of Cd and Pb environmental bioavailability =0.82 and 0.83, respectively). Even though
  alone none of the chemical methods tested could assess Zn environmental bioavailability
  to snails, the addition of pH, iron and aluminium oxides allowed the variation of
  assimilation fluxes to be predicted. A conceptual and practical method to use soil
  characteristics for risk assessment is proposed based on these results. We conclude
  that as yet there is no universal chemical method to predict metal environmental
  bioavailability to snails, and that the soil factors having the greatest impact
  depend on the metal considered.'
