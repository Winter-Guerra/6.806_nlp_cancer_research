  The objectives of this research were to systematically assess the functional values
  of germinated soybean and mung bean, and to determine the optimal germination time
  for yielding functional substances. Changes in phenolics, ascorbic acid, isoflavone,
  as well as antioxidant capacities of soybean and mung bean during germination were
  investigated. Results showed that germination had positive enhancement effects on
  bioactive compounds in beans. Both compositions and contents of isoflavones in soybean
  were influenced by germination, three-day germination was optimal time for production
  of germinated soybean with the highest total isoflavone content, the contents of
  genistein, daidzein, total aglycone in germinated soybean were increased 3, 2.4,
  and 2.5 folds, respectively, as compared to non-germinated soybean. Current results
  indicate that germinated beans are better raw materials than non-germinated beans
  for gaining health beneficial substances.'
