  study used in vitro and in vivo experimental models to investigate the anti-inflammatory
  potential of the butanol fraction of red bean ethanol extract, which contains the
  biologically active molecule catechin-7- β-D-glucopyranoside. Treatment with BF-RBEE
  inhibited nitric oxide production in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated macrophages through
  suppression of extracellular signal- regulated kinase and IκBα activation. In an
  in vivo murine sepsis model, oral administration of BF-RBEE improved mouse survival.
  Specifically, the survival rate of mice injected with LPS was 0 and 40% in ICR and
  BALB/c mice, respectively, whereas the survival of mice co-treated with BF-RBEE
  was 100% in both mouse types. This increase in survival with the BF-RBEE administration
  was correlated with decreased tumor-necrosis factor-α and interferon-γ and increased
  interleukin-10. Oral administration of BF-RBEE also inhibited total and ovalbumin-specific
  IgE production in experimental mice. These results suggest the possible usefulness
  of red beans in the treatment of inflammatory diseases. Keywords: red bean, sepsis,
  lipopolysaccharide, ovalbumin, IgE Introduction Inflammation is a naturally occurring
  immune process by which bacterial and viral infections trigger the activation of
  a cascade of immune cells. Among these cells, macrophages play a critical role in
  the production of various inflammatory mediators, including nitric oxide, prostaglandins,
  and pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interferon- γ, interleukin-6, IL-1β, and
  tumor necrosis factor-α. Lipopolysaccharide signals macrophages to produce a variety
  of inflammatory mediators through the activation of intracellular kinases such as
  mitogen-activated protein kinases and phosphoinositide 3-kinases. Of the various
  MAPKs, extracellular signal-regulated kinase and p38 are related to NO production
  by the enzymatic reaction of inducible nitric oxide synthase in LPS-stimulated macrophages.
  MAPKs also induce the activation of nuclear factor-κB and activator protein-1, which
  are involved in the expression of pro-inflammatory genes such as iNOS and cyclo-
  oxygenase-2. Many pathologic conditions including cancer, septic shock, rheumatoid
  arthritis, and autoimmune diabetes involve the over-production of inflammatory mediators
  in macrophages. For this reason, many therapies target the modulation of abnormal
  inflammatory responses. Recently, researchers have aimed to develop novel anti-
  inflammatory materials from natural resources. In Korea, the seeds of Phaseolus
  calcaratus cv. Roxburgh, known as ‘red beans’, are both a common food and a traditional
  anti-inflammatory medicine. It was recently reported that an ethanol red bean extract
  as well as its ethyl acetate fraction inhibited NO production and iNOS and COX-2
  expression in LPS-treated macrophages. The authors found that this inhibition was

  a blockade of LPS-stimulated activation of MAPK and NF-κB. This and other studies
  identified catechin-7-β- D-glucopyranoside as the main active component of the red
  bean extract. Similarly, a b utanol f raction from the r ed b ean e thanol e xtract,
  abbreviated BF-RBEE, showed an inhibitory activity on LPS-mediated NO production.
  In contrast, n-hexane or water fraction did not show a significant inhibition on
  NO production. The yields after fractionation with the organic solvents from the
  ethanol extract were approximately 5-fold higher in butanol fraction than ethyl
  acetate fraction. The BF-RBEE also contained 1.54% of catechin-7-β-D-glucopyranoside.
  However, the anti-inflammatory mechanisms as well as the immune modulating effects
  in vivo of the BF-RBEE were not explored. This study investigated the anti-inflammatory
  activities of BF-RBEE using various experimental systems. Initially, the anti-inflammatory
  properties of the BF-RBEE in vitro were explored and compared to those of sinapic
  acid and mesalamine. The in vivo anti-inflammatory potential of BF-RBEE was also
  determined using a murine sepsis model. In addition, the effects of BF-RBEE on ovalbumin
  sensitization and challenge in mice were examined. Materials and Methods Chemicals
  and laboratory wares Unless otherwise specified, chemicals and laboratory wares
  were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and Falcon Labware, respectively. Plant materials
  A voucher specimen of red beans was deposited at the Center for Health Care and
  Technology Development, HanPoong Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.. The center prepared the
  BF-RBEE and quantified its catechin-7-β-D-glucopyranoside content as described previously.
  Briefly, ethanol red bean extract prepared from the dried red bean was partitioned
  with 2,000 mL distilled water and then extracted with the same volume of the following
  solvents stepwise; n-hexane, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol. The butanol fraction
  was concentrated and lyophilized to yield 86 g of BF-RBEE. The active component,
  catechin-7-β-D- glucopyranoside, was isolated from BF-RBEE using Amberlite XAD-4
  resin and Sephadex LH-20 column, and its content was determined by applying sub-fractions
  of BF-RBEE to a HPLC. In the experiments using in vitro systems, BF-RBEE was dissolved
  in ethanol, and the final concentration of ethanol did not exceed 0.5% in the culture
  medium through all experiments. However, the BF-RBEE was resuspended in distilled
  water when it was orally administered to mice. Cell culture and treatment RAW 264.7
  macrophages were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with
  10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, and antibiotics. Cells in 2 mL or 200
  µL media were seeded in 6- or 96-well flat-bottomed plates, respectively. When the
  cells had reached 70-80% confluence, they were exposed to various concentrations
  of BF-RBEE in the presence or absence of MAPK inhibitors immediately before stimulating
  the cells with 1 µg/mL LPS. Measurements of NO production and cell viability As
  described elsewhere, the nitrite concentration in the culture medium was measured
  as an indicator of NO production using the Griess reagent. In addition, MTT was
  used to determine cell viability and the resulting absorbance was read at 570 nm
  using a SpectraCount TM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader. Measurement of
  cytokines To determine the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the culture supernatants
  of cells stimulated with 1 µg/mL LPS in the presence of BF-RBEE, the specific OptEIA™
  ELISA kit was used. In the murine sepsis model, the serum levels of TNF-α, IFN-γ,
  and IL-10 were measured. Western blot analysis This study used 12% SDS-PAGE to separate
  equal protein amounts for each sample and blotted them onto polyvinylidene difluoride
  membranes. The blots were probed with primary and secondary antibodies, which were
  then developed with enhanced chemiluminescence prior to exposure to X-ray film.
  All mono- or poly-clonal antibodies used in this study were obtained from Santa
  Cruz Biotechnology. Animals Female ICR, C57BL/6, and BALB/c mice were housed in
  automatically controlled conditions with a 12-h light/dark cycle at 22±1 oC with
  45-55% relative humidity. All mice had free access to standard rodent food pellet
  and water. This study was approved by the Laboratory Animal Center, and all experiments
  were carried out according to the guidelines of the Animal Care and Use Committee
  of Chonbuk National University. Survival study Female ICR and C57BL/6 mice were
  randomly divided into several groups of 5 mice each and Anti-sepsis Potential of
  Red Bean 1127 caged separately before treatment with the BF-RBEE and/ or LPS. Mice
  were orally administered either 200 µL phosphate-buffered saline alone or 200 mL
  PBS with BF-RBEE every other day for 10 days. Mice received an intraperitoneal injection
  of LPS 1 day after the last administration of BF- RBEE, and their survival was recorded
  every 6 h after the LPS injection for 4 days. Other groups of mice were also administrated
  with BF-RBEE and/or LPS as described above. Blood was collected from the animals
  at several time points after LPS injection and used for the determination of pro-
  and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Allergen sensitization and challenge Mice were
  treated with ovalbumin according to a protocol described elsewhere with slight modifications.
  In brief, unsensitized BALB/c mice received intraperitoneal injections of aluminum
  hydroxide in PBS. Mice in group II were sensitized on day 1 and 7 by intraperitoneal
  injection of 50 µg ovalbumin adsorbed with 2 mg aluminium hydroxide in PBS, and
  challenged on day 17 and 19 by intraperitoneal injection with the same dose of ovalbumin.
  Mice in group III received oral administration of 2.5 mg of BF-RBEE 24 h before
  administration of ovalbumin for sensitization. Mice in group IV received oral administration
  of 2.5 mg of BF-RBEE 24 h prior to the allergen challenge. Blood from the mice was
  collected after 24 h of the challenge. Evaluation of ovalbumin-specific IgE level
  After 24 h of the last challenge, mice were anesthetized by inhalation of diethyl
  ether and whole blood was then collected by cardiac puncture with a syringe. Blood
  samples were centrifuged at 10,000×g for 10 min at 4 oC and the supernatant were
  used to measure serum IgE level. The levels of total and ovalbumin-specific IgE
  in mice serum were determined by ELISA at the Bank for Cytokine Research. Total
  serum IgE concentrations were calculated from a standard curve of mouse IgE. Sample
  levels of ovalbumin- specific IgE are expressed as arbitrary units. Statistical
  analyses All data are expressed as mean± standard deviation. One-way analysis of
  variance followed by Scheffe’s test or Student’s t-text was applied to determine
  differences between groups. A p-value ;0.05 was considered significant. Results
  and Discussion Inhibitory effects of BF-RBEE on NO production, pro- inflammatory
  cytokines, and MAPK and IκBα phosphorylation in LPS-stimulated macrophages This
  study initially evaluated the effects of BF-RBEE on LPS- stimulated NO production
  in RAW 264.7 cells due to the pathologic consequences of NO over-production by macrophages.
  The present study showed that after exposure to 1 µg/mL LPS for 48 h, the nitrite
  concentration in the culture medium increased approximately 11-fold compared to
  the control value. Treatment of cells with BF-RBEE attenuated NO production in a
  dose-dependent manner. Fig. 1. Anti-inflammatory potential of BF-RBEE in LPS-stimulated

  of BF-RBEE and/or LPS. Conditioned media from the culture supernatants were assayed
  for NO production after 48 h of incubation; Cells exposed to BF-RBEE and/or LPS
  for 24 h were harvested to measure iNOS expression by Western blot. Cells were also
  exposed to 100 µg/mL BF-RBEE or 10 µM each of MAPK inhibitors 30 min before exposure
  to LPS; NO production and viability were measured after 48 h of exposure; Phospho-MAPK

  LPS for 1 h. Cells were then processed for the analysis of IκB degradation by immunoblot
  analysis. p&lt;0.05, p&lt;0.01, and p&lt;0.001 vs. untreated control cells Treatment
  with BF-RBEE caused dose-dependent inhibition of the LPS-stimulated increase of
  iNOS proteins in RAW 264.7 cells, in which treatment with 50 µg/mL BF-RBEE decreased
  iNOS to the basal level. Consistent with the activity of BF-RBEE, LPS-induced NO
  production was inhibited by treatment with inhibitors of ERK and p38 MAPK or BF-
  RBEE. JNK inhibitor did not affect the level of NO in LPS-stimulated cells, whereas
  it protected cells from LPS-mediated cytotoxicity. In particular, BF-RBEE largely
  prevented the decreased viability of LPS-exposed cells. Furthermore, treatment with
  BF-RBEE inhibited p-ERK and p-JNK, whereas mesalamine attenuated p-p38 and p-JNK.
  These results are partially consistent with previous findings that red beans have
  anti- inflammatory effects in LPS-stimulated macrophages, and that ERK1/2 and p38
  MAPK are related to LPS- induced NO production. The current findings also suggest
  that BF-RBEE reduces NO levels by inhibiting ERK activation, while increasing viability
  by preventing JNK phosphorylation in LPS-stimulated macrophages. NF-κB activation
  is required for macrophage production of cytokines, including TNF-α, IL-1β, and
  IL-6. In addition, NF-κB activation followed by IκB phosphorylation and degradation
  is a crucial event in the inflammatory response. For these reasons, the effects
  of the BF- RBEE on IκBα and its phosphorylated form were evaluated in LPS-stimulated
  cells. While LPS stimulation increased p-IκBα and its subsequent degradation, administration
  of BF-RBEE caused a dose-dependent inhibition of these changes. Mesalamine also
  prevented LPS- mediated changes in p-IκBα and IκBα levels. Further, addition of
  BF-RBEE attenuated the levels of all measured cytokines; the reductions in IL-6
  and IL-1β were more prominent than those in TNF-α. In contrast, treatment with 100
  µg/mL mesalamine or sinapic acid did not inhibit the LPS-stimulated increase in
  IL-6. The LPS- mediated production of TNF-α and IL-1β was slightly inhibited by
  sinapic acid, but not by mesalamine. These results suggest that red beans decrease
  the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in LPS-stimulated cells and this is
  closely associated with the inhibition of NF-κB activation. BF-RBEE improves survival
  in a sepsis model and decreases pro-inflammatory cytokines Approximately 900,000
  cases of sepsis per year are reported in the United States, 20% of which result
  in mortality. Many investigators have focused their efforts on the development of
  bioactive materials to combat the acute, severe Fig. 3. Inhibitory effects of BF-RBEE
  on the production of IL- 6, IL-1β, and TNF-α in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells.
  Cells were stimulated with 1 µg/mL LPS in the presence of various concentrations
  of BF-RBEE or 100 µg/mL mesalamine or sinapic acid. After 48 h of co- incubation,
  the levels of these cytokines in the culture supernatants were measured by ELISA.

  model. inflammation that occurs during sepsis. The in vivo results suggest that
  BF-RBEE may exert a beneficial effect in sepsis. As shown in Fig. 4, the survival
  rate over 2 days of mice injected intraperitoneally with LPS was 0% in ICR mice
  and 40% in BALB/c mice. In contrast, the survival of mice pretreated with BF-RBEE
  was 100% in both types. Oral administration of mesalamine under the same conditions
  improved mouse survival to approximately 80%. In light of the pathogenic mechanism
  of sepsis, which involves intravascular inflammation mediated by various cytokines
  and chemokines, the effects of BF-RBEE on TNF-α, IFN-γ, and IL-10 concentrations
  were investigated in a murine sepsis model. The serum cytokine levels of mice injected
  with LPS differed significantly according to the time after LPS injection. TNF-α
  increased rapidly and transiently in the LPS-injected mice, to levels of 8 and 4.5
  ng/mL measured at 1 and 2 h after LPS injection. In contrast, such increases were
  not observed in mice co-treated with the BF-RBEE. The concentration of IFN-γ was
  also increased significantly in the mice injected with LPS alone compared to those
  co-treated with BF- RBEE. Unlike TNF-α, the LPS- mediated increase in IFN-γ peaked
  8 h after LPS injection. In contrast, IL-10 levels in mice treated with LPS alone
  were significantly lower between 1 and 4 h after LPS injection in comparison with
  mice co-treated with BF- RBEE. Another report on a murine model of LPS-induced sepsis
  found rapidly increasing serum TNF-α levels, consistent with the present findings.
  In addition, it has been reported that in patients with sepsis, IFN-γ level is correlated
  with poor outcomes. The role of IFN-γ has been further elucidated by a study in
  which IFN-γ-specific antibodies attenuate the in vivo effects in animal models of
  sepsis. While TNF-α and IFN-γ increase the inflammatory response during the process
  of sepsis, IL-10 is involved in the inhibition of TNF-α and IFN-γ production. In
  addition, the IL-10-mediated decrease of these pro-inflammatory cytokines in the
  blood is correlated with increased survival. Although further research is needed
  to clarify the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms, the improved survival in
  septic animals treated with BF-RBEE is correlated with increased serum IL-10. BF-RBEE
  inhibits IgE production in ovalbumin- exposed mice This study also examined the
  potential of BF-RBEE to modulate the allergic response using experimental animals.
  It was found that serum IgE increased approximately 18-fold in ovalbumin-sensitized
  and challenged mice compared to unsensitized mice. In mice sensitized to and challenged
  with ovalbumin that orally received 2.5 mg BF- RBEE during allergen sensitization,
  this IgE Fig. 5. Modulation of serum cytokine concentrations by ora l treatment

  differences between the experiments. 1130 Park et al. increase was significantly
  attenuated. Mice in group IV also had significantly lower serum IgE compared to
  control mice. Similarly, ovalbumin-immunized mice had higher levels of ovalbumin-specific
  IgE, which was diminished in mice co-administered with BF-RBEE during antigen sensitization
  or challenge. These results suggest that co-administration of red beans down-regulates
  total and ovalbumin-specific IgE production. In summary, this study demonstrates
  that BF-RBEE exerts anti-inflammatory effects on LPS-activated macrophages as well
  as in LPS-mediated sepsis. The present results also suggest a role for BF-RBEE in
  the treatment of allergic diseases. Collectively, these findings support the potential
  of red bean to favorably modulate the immune response in vivo. Future research is
  warranted to determine the clinical utility of BF-RBEE in inflammatory disorders
  and to elucidate the cellular mechanisms involved. Furthermore, additional experiments
  to indentify other compounds responsible for the anti-inflammatory action will be
  needed because catechin-7-β-D-glucopyranoside content in the fraction is only 1.54%.
