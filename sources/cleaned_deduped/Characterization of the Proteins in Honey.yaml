  This study focused on the extraction and identification of honey proteins from selected
  samples  from Malaysia. The extraction methods, dialysis, ammonium sulfate, and
  sodium tungstate precipitation methods, were used to obtain the proteins from the
  honey. The method of membrane dialysis provided the highest yield of proteins based
  on the Bradford assay. This method also provided the highest number of protein bands
  and the clearest protein bands on a 12% polyacrylamide gel compared with the other
  two precipitation methods. The results revealed that the precipitation methods may
  degrade the proteins because of the use of strong chemicals and losses after repeated
  transfers. Mass spectrometric data showed that the honey contained major royal jelly
  proteins  such as MRJP-1, MRJP-2, MRJP-5, and MRJP-7, as well as a few uncharacterized
  proteins from Apis mellifera. MRJP-1 was the most abundant protein, particularly
  in Acacia samples. Honey proteins were also shown to possess significant antioxidant
  activity as free radical scavengers and reducing agents.'
