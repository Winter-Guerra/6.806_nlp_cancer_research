  defensin from Hokkaido large .md
text: "\n\nLectins  are defined as sugar-binding proteins or glycoproteins with various
  biological activities. A 60 kDa dimeric hemagglutinin with a blocked N-terminus
  was isolated in large yield  from the common edible bean Phaseolus vulgaris cv.
  Hokkaido large pinto bean. Its hemagglutinating, antifungal, and antitumor activities
  as well as the effects of carbohydrate and metal ions on its hemagglutinating activity
  were examined. It inhibited the proliferation of nasopharyngeal carcinoma, human
  breast cancer, and hepatoma  cells. The IC50 values toward HepG2, MCF7, and CNE2
  cells after treatment for 48 h were 8.1, 6.07, and 7.49 M, respectively, which were
  relatively low among lectins of different P. vulgaris cultivars. From the pinto
  beans, a 10888 Da antifungal peptide with similarity to plant defensins as revealed
  by mass spectroscopic analysis was also isolated with a yield of 3.2 mg of proteins
  from 60 g of beans. The large defensin was capable of inhibiting mycelial growth
  in Mycosphaerella arachidicola, Setosphaeria turcica, Bipolaris maydis, and Fusarium
  oxysporum but not in Valsa mali.\n\nFrom ancient times to the present, pathogen
  invasion is a health hazard to most of living organisms. During the process of evolution,
  organisms have developed various defense mechanisms to eliminate these potential
  life-threatening risks. Lectins and defensins are two types of defense proteins
  that plants secrete for self-protection.\n\nLectins  are sugar-binding proteins
  with high carbohydrate selectivity, which exist ubiquitously in diverse species
  of plants, animals, viruses, bacteria, and fungi. Along with a defensive nature,
  some of them, such as lectins from edible plants, demonstrate a strong capability
  of inhibiting cancer cell proliferation. For example, concanavalin A, a mannose-
  and glucose-binding lectin isolated from jack bean, was found to have considerable
  potential in anticancer applications. However, apart from it, currently available
  lectins may have their own limitations for further development and application.
  Thus, the discovery of more potential targets is of great significance and a worthwhile
  undertaking.\n\nPhaseolus vulgaris is a leguminous species that produces common
  edible beans. Different P. vulgaris cultivars share the same characteristic; that
  is, most of them contain a lectin or a phytohemagglutinin as a storage protein.
  Even though lectins from various cultivars have similar molecular sizes, they may
  possess different biological activities and vary in the potency of a particular
  activity. Antifungal proteins such as defensin may or may not be present in a cultivar.
  Hence, we set out to isolate a lectin and an antifungal protein from P. vulgaris
  cultivar Hokkaido large pinto bean.\n\nHokkaido large pinto beans were purchased
  from a Japanese food supermarket in Hong Kong. After soaking in distilled water
  overnight, 60 g of beans was homogenized in a Waring blender in 500 mL of 20 mM
  Tris-HCl buffer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 16000 rpm for 30 min at 4 C.
  The supernatant was filtered by using a piece of filter paper before loading onto
  an Affi-gel blue gel  column  that had been pre-equilibrated with 20 mM Tris-HCl
  buffer. Then, the column was washed with 1 M NaCl in 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer  to elute
  the adsorbed proteins. The adsorbed fraction was dialyzed against double-distilled
  water overnight at 4 C and lyophilized into powder form. The powder was resuspended
  \ in 20 mM NH4HCO3 buffer  before FPLC-anion exchange chromatography on a Mono Q
  column  using an AKTA Purifier. Adsorbed proteins were eluted using a 01 M NaCl
  gradient in 20 mM NH4HCO3 buffer. The first peak containing adsorbed materials was
  collected, dialyzed, lyophilized, resuspended in 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer, and then
  subjected to FPLC-gel filtration on a Superdex 75 HR 10/300 column. The first major
  absorbance peak contained purified Hokkaido large pinto bean lectin.\n\nThe three
  chromatographic steps used for purifying defensin from Hokkaido large pinto beans
  were the same as described above for the purification of hemagglutinin. In the Mono
  Q purification step, the unbound fraction was collected and dialyzed against double-distilled
  water, and buffer was added, resulting in a protein solution in 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer.
  Then the sample was subjected to FPLC-gel filtration on a Superdex 75 HR 10/300
  column. The last major absorbance peak contained purified Hokkaido large pinto bean
  defensin.\n\nSodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  was carried
  out using a 15% separating gel and a 5% stacking gel. The protein sample was diluted
  with loading buffer containing -mercaptoethanol  to reduce disulfide bonds in the
  proteins. The samples were boiled in water for 5 min. Then, electrophoresis was
  performed at a constant current of 10 mA and a constant voltage of 120 V for about
  75 min. After electrophoresis, the gel was stained with Coomassie brilliant blue,
  and it was put on a shaker to shake for 1 h and then destained with 10% acetic acid
  overnight.\n\nN-Terminal amino acid sequence analysis was carried out using an HP
  1000A Edman degradation unit and an HP 1000 HPLC system.\n\nThe molecular mass of
  the antifungal protein was verified by performing matrix-assisted laser desorption
  ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, using an Applied Biosystems 4700 Proteomics
  Analyzer.\n\nMatrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight time-of-flight
  tandem mass spectrometry  was utilized to fragment sample proteins by MS/MS, and
  the fragments were identified by top-down proteomic analysis. The defense protein
  was identified by analysis of MS and MS/MS data using NCBInr and SwissProt databases.\n\nA
  50 L test sample was subjected to a 2-fold serial dilution with phosphate-buffered
  saline   in a 96-well microtiter U-plate. Afterward, 50 L of a rabbit red blood
  cell suspension  in PBS was added to each diluted sample. PBS  mixed with 50 L rabbit
  red blood cell was used as a negative control. The plate was incubated at room temperature
  until the red blood cells in the negative control formed a red dot at the bottom
  of the well, which means it had fully sedimented. The hemagglutinating activity
  of each of the test samples was then recorded. One hemagglutination unit or hemagglutination
  titer is defined as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of the lectin sample
  that induces hemagglutination. Specific hemagglutinating activity is the number
  of hemagglutination units per milligram of protein.\n\nDetermination of pH Stability
  and Temperature Stability of Hemagglutinating Activity\n\nTo ascertain the effect
  of pH, solutions/buffers with different pH values from 0 to 14 were prepared as
  follows: pH 01, HCl; pH 25, NH4OAc; pH 610, Tris-HCl; pH 1112, NaHCO3; and pH 1314,
  NaOH. The protein sample was mixed with an equal volume  of a solution at a specified
  pH and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Then, the mixtures were neutralized
  and assay of hemagglutinating activity was carried out. The hemagglutinating activity
  remaining was determined.\n\nTo test the effect of temperature, the protein sample
  was heated at different temperatures from 20 to 100 C, at 10 C intervals for 30
  min. The sample was immediately cooled on ice for another 30 min to terminate the
  incubation and then warmed up to room temperature. The assay of hemagglutinating
  assay was carried out as described above. The hemagglutinating activity of the lectin
  following incubation at room temperature was considered as 100% activity.\n\nTo
  investigate the carbohydrate specificity of the purified sample, 200 mM solutions
  of various kinds of sugars including N-acetyl-glucosamine, l-arabinose, d-fructose,
  d-fucose, d-galactose, d-glucose, lactose, maltose, d-mannose, raffinose, l-rhamnose,
  and d-xylose were used to dissolve the lyophilized sample to 0.1 mg/mL. Assay of
  hemagglutinating activity was carried out using the carbohydrate solutions at their
  particular concentrations for 2-fold serial dilution instead of PBS. The percentage
  of hemagglutinating activity remaining was calculated.\n\nOn the other hand, the
  effects of metallic chlorides encompassing calcium chloride, manganese chloride,
  ferrous chloride, magnesium chloride, copper chloride, and zinc chloride on the
  hemagglutinating activity of Hokkaido large pinto bean hemagglutinin were also tested.
  First, the hemagglutinating activity of the original hemagglutinin solution was
  assessed and the fold number of 2-fold serial dilution that caused the test sample
  solution to begin to lose its hemagglutining activity was recorded. Then the sample
  solution was diluted with the recorded fold. Then, 25 L of a 200 mM solution of
  a specified metallic salt  was subjected to a 2-fold serial dilution with 0.9% NaCl
  in a 96-well plate. Afterward, 25 L of diluted sample solution was added to each
  well, and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 1 h. In the control
  group, 25 L of NaCl was used for 2-fold serial dilution instead of the metallic
  salt. Fifty microliters of a 2% rabbit erythrocyte suspension were then added to
  each well for another 2 h incubation at room temperature. Hemagglutination was estimated
  afterward. A second control experiment containing only the metal salt and red blood
  cells was run concurrently to ascertain the effect of each metal salt on the red
  blood cells in the assay.\n\nAntifungal activity assay was carried out for investigating
  the antifungal potential of Hokkaido large pinto bean hemagglutinin. Different phytopathogenic
  fungi including Mycosphaerella arachidicola, Setosphaeria turcica, Bipolaris maydis,
  Fusarium oxysporum, and Valsa mali were grown in Petri dishes  containing 10 mL
  of potato dextrose agar. A small amount of each fungal species was planted in the
  middle of the dish and then incubated at room temperature for a few days until it
  developed into a mycelial colony. Test samples  were added onto sterile blank round
  paper disks, which were placed 0.5 cm away from the edge of the mycelial colony.
  Sterile buffer was added as control. After that the plates were incubated at room
  temperature until the mycelia had grown near the disk of the control group. If the
  mycelium could not grow near the disk and a clear invagination without mycelium
  was developed, it indicated that the test sample possessed antifungal activity.\n\nFor
  testing the antifungal activity of the purified proteins against Candida albicans,
  1  107 cells were treated with 2 mg of protein and incubated in Sabouraud dextrose
  broth. In the control, the protein sample was replaced by autoclaved broth. All
  eppendorf tubes were placed in an orbital shaker at 37 C with shaking at a speed
  of 200 rpm and incubated for 6 h. Ten-fold serial dilution of 50 L of the mixture
  containing the test protein and cells was performed in broth. Fifty microliters
  of the fourth and fifth 10-fold diluted solution were spread on agar plates. Cell
  counting was implemented after incubation of the plates at 37 C for 24 h.\n\nThe
  method for testing the antifungal activity of Hokkaido large pinto bean defensin
  was as previously described. Six species of fungi were tested including M. arachidicola,
  S. turcica, B. maydis, F. oxysporum, V. mali, and C. albicans. For the assay of
  antifungal activity toward C. albicans, the concentration of defensin used was 0.1
  mg/mL.\n\nNasopharyngeal carcinoma, human breast cancer, hepatoma  cells, and an
  immortalized normal nasopharyngeal epithelial cell line NP 69 and human embryo liver
  \ cells, from American Type Culture Collection, were suspended in RPMI medium at
  a cell density of 5  104 cells/mL. A 100 L aliquot of these cell suspensions was
  seeded and incubated in the 96-well plates overnight. Then, the protein samples
  at concentrations of 0.49125 M  in 100 L of RPMI medium were added to the wells,
  followed by incubation in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 C. After incubation
  for 24 and 48 h, the medium was discarded, and the wells were washed with PBS. Then,
  25 L of a 5 mg/mL solution of 3--2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide  in PBS was added
  into each well, and the plates were incubated at 37 C for 4 h. After incubation,
  the plates were centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant was carefully
  removed, and 150 L of dimethyl sulfoxide  was added into the wells to dissolve the
  MTT. OD 590 nm was measured within 10 min by using a microplate reader. Percentage
  inhibition of the MCF7, HepG2, and CNE2 cells was calculated by using the following
  formula:   100%.\n\nResults were expressed as means  standard deviation. The median
  inhibition concentration  was determined using SPSS 11.0.1 statistical software.
  For between-group comparisons, one-way ANOVA was used. Differences with p values
  of 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.\n\nThree chromatographic
  steps were utilized for the purification of hemagglutinin from Hokkaido large pinto
  bean. Hemagglutinins possess at least one noncatalytic domain that reversibly binds
  to specific carbohydrate structure. This property enables them to aggregate red
  blood cells. By using the test for hemagglutinating activity to monitor all of the
  chromatographic fractions, the target chromatographic fraction possessing hemagglutinating
  activity was identified and selected for further purification\n\nThe first chromatographic
  step on Affi-gel blue gel separated proteins into an unbound fraction that contained
  most of the proteins of Hokkaido large pinto bean, as shown in Figures 1A and 2A,
  and a bound fraction, which appeared as a sharper peak. The bound fraction I was
  obtained by elution with 1 M NaCl solution in the starting buffer. Both unbound
  and bound fractions were tested by using the test for hemagglutinating activity.
  The bound fraction I was identified as the target chromatographic fraction containing
  hemagglutinating activity. From the SDS-PAGE gel photo shown in Figure 2A, proteins
  with a size of 30 kDa constituted the bulk of the adsorbed fraction. The second
  step was FPLC-cation exchange chromatography of bound fraction I from the Affi-gel
  blue gel column on Mono Q, which yielded one unadsorbed fraction and two major adsorbed
  peaks. Hemagglutinating activity was enriched in fraction II. In the third step,
  fraction II was loaded to an FPLC-gel filtration Superdex 75 column for the purpose
  of further purification. A major peak was obtained including fractions A and B,
  which were collected at 9 and 9.5 mL, respectively. Totally a yield of 190 mg of
  protein from fractions A and B was obtained from 60 g of Hokkaido large pinto bean.\n\nFigure

  regions framed with dotted lines signify target fractions with hemagglutinating
  activity, which were collected and selected for the next step of purification. Peaks

  16th mL.  Fractions A and B eluted from Superdex 75 eluted at the 9th and 9.5th
  mL, which were labeled in Figure 1C.\n\nFrom the SDS-PAGE gel photo shown in Figure
  2C, a single band with a molecular weight around 30 kDa was observed in fractions
  A and B, indicating that the target hemagglutinin was eluted in the ninth milliliter.
  On the basis of the standard calibration curve for the Superdex 75 column, the molecular
  mass of Hokkaido large pinto bean hemagglutinin was about 60 kDa. This indicated
  that the hemagglutinin is a protein with a molecular mass of about 60 kDa and composed
  of two subunits.\n\nDetermination of Temperature Stability, pH Stability, Carbohydrate
  Selectivity, and Metal Ion Effect\n\nHokkaido large pinto bean hemagglutinin exhibited
  moderate thermostability. Its hemagglutinating activity was maintained at temperatures
  up to 60 C but dropped dramatically at 70 C, when only half of the hemagglutinating
  activity remained. At 80 C only 0.39% residual activity was detected, and the activity
  was completely abolished at 90 C. Testing for pH stability revealed that it retained
  full activity in the pH range of pH 212, indicating fairly high pH stability. The
  hemagglutinating activity was halved at both pH 1 and 13 and vanished at pH 0 and
  14. For investigation of carbohydrate selectivity, none of the carbohydrates at
  200 mM concentration interacted with Hokkaido large pinto bean hemagglutinin including
  d-galactose, d-fructose, d-xylose, d-glucose, d-mannose, l-rhamnose, l-fucose, l-arabinose,
  xylitol, glucosamine, glucuronic acid, galactonic acid, maltose, -lactose, and raffinose,
  as the hemagglutining activity was not attenuated after the addition of various
  kinds of carbohydrates.\n\nTesting the effect of metal ions on the hemagglutinating
  activity of Hokkaido large pinto bean hemagglutinin disclosed that 48.8 M Cu2+ or
  Fe2+ ions, 97.7 M Mn2+ ions, 195.3 M Zn2+ ions, and 781.1 M Ca2+ ions enabled the
  diluted protein sample solution to regain its hemagglutinating activity, indicating
  an augmenting effect.\n\nThe mycelia of different phytopathogenic fungi all successfully
  grew near the disks in the presence of Hokkaido large pinto bean hemagglutinin,
  as in the case of the negative control, and there was no difference in the cell
  number of C. albicans between the hemagglutinin-treated group and the control group.
  The data suggest that Hokkaido large pinto bean hemagglutinin had no antifungal
  effect.\n\nThe antiproliferative activity of Hokkaido large pinto bean hemagglutinin
  against HepG2, MDA-MB-231, MCF7, and CNE2 cancer cells was assessed by MTT assay.
  Results of the assay disclosed that treatment with Hokkaido large pinto bean hemagglutinin
  for 24 h did not achieve its maximum inhibitory effect. At concentrations up to
  125 M, the hemagglutinin did not achieve 50% inhibition of each type of cancer cells
  after 24 h of treatment. The inhibitory effect against MDA-MB 231 metastatic breast
  cancer cells was minimal. The lectin achieved only 21% inhibition at the highest
  tested concentration, compared with 43, 45, and 47% inhibition of proliferation
  of HepG2, MCF7, and CNE2 cancer cells, respectively. However, after uninterrupted
  incubation with Hokkaido large pinto bean hemagglutinin for 48 h, the inhibitory
  effect against each type of cancer cells was stronger than that observed after 24
  h of treatment, with IC50 values of 8.135, 6.067, and 7.492 M toward HepG2, MCF7,
  and CNE2 cancer cells, respectively. The IC50 value for MCF7 cells was smaller than
  that for CNE2 cancer cells. A further decline in proliferation rate was obtained
  in CNE2 cells after treatment with 125 M hemagglutinin, which was 74% compared to
  67%. At 125 M concentration, Hokkaido large pinto bean hemagglutinin inhibited the
  growth of MDA-MB-231 cancer cells by 28%. The hemagglutinin did not affect the viability
  of normal liver cell line WRL68 at 24 h, but caused inhibition when the treatment
  was lengthened to 48 h, and gave rise to an IC50 value of 45 M after treatment for
  72 h. Yet the effect was much weaker compared with the aforementioned tumor cell
  lines. A comparison of the characteristics of lectins/hemagglutinins from various
  P. vulgaris cultivars is presented in Table 4.\n\nFigure 3. Results of MTT assay
  for Hokkaido large pinto bean hemagglutinin: MTT assay results after treatment of
  HepG2, MDA-MB-231, MCF7, and CNE2 cancer cells with different concentrations of
  Hokkaido large pinto bean hemagglutinin for  24 h and  48 h. Results represent the
  mean  SD.\n\nHokkaido large pinto bean defensin was discovered during the purification
  of Hokkaido pinto bean hemagglutinin. By monitoring the antifungal activity of chromatographic
  fraction obtained at each purification step with the assay of antifungal activity,
  it was observed that the crude extract and sample obtained after purification on
  Affi-gel blue gel  contained antifungal protein, as they both exerted antifungal
  effect toward M. arachidicola. In the second chromatographic step using FPLC-cation
  exchange on Mono Q, the unadsorbed fraction referred to as fraction II in Figure
  4B exhibited antifungal activity. The proteins in this fraction  were checked by
  SDS-PAGE, as shown in Figure 5B. After further purification of Mono Q fraction II
  by FPLC-gel filtration on a Superdex 75 column, several main peaks were obtained.
  Fractions a, b, c, and d were collected at elution volumes of 10.5th, 12.5th, 17th,
  and 17.5th mL, respectively. The molecular size and purity of the proteins in the
  fractions are shown in Figure 5C. After assay of antifungal activity of each fraction,
  both fractions c and d were found to be effective. Collection of fractions c and
  d resulted in totally a yield of only 3.2 mg of protein from 60 g of Hokkaido large
  pinto beans.\n\nFigure 4. Purification of Hokkaido large pinto bean defensin:  affinity
  chromatography on Affi-gel blue gel;  FPLC of Affi-gel blue gel fraction I on Mono

  c, and d were collected at elution volumes of 10.5, 12.5, 17, and 17.5 mL, respectively.
  Regions encircled with dotted lines signify target fractions with antifungal activity,
  which were collected and selected for the next step of purification.\n\nFigure 5.

  volumes of 10.5, 12.5, and 17 mL, respectively, during gel filtration on Superdex
  75. Antifungal activity was detected only in fraction c.\n\nTable 3. Percentage
  Reduction of Viability of WRL68 Normal Liver Cells  Caused by Hemagglutinin from
  Hokkaido Large Pinto Beana  \n\nDifferent letters  next to the data indicate statistically
  significant difference. The same letter represents no statistically significant
  difference.\n\nThe molecular weight of the protein was confirmed by MALDI-TOF MS
  to be 10888 Da. An analysis of MS and MS/MS data using NCBInr and SwissProt databases
  revealed 40% similarity with defensin D1 of P. vulgaris protein accession gi|312982410.
  Hence, the defense protein from fraction c can be regarded as a member of the defensin
  group.\n\nFive fungal species were utilized in the assay of antifungal activity,
  comprising M. arachidicola, S. turcica, B. maydis, F. oxysporum, and V. mali. Distilled
  water was used instead of protein sample as negative control. The antifungal activity
  of fractions a, b, and c was tested. It was found that fraction b had no antifungal
  effect on all five types of fungal species, as the mycelial growth extended to the
  paper disks. Fraction a had only a weak antifungal effect on M. arachidicola. Fraction
  c was capable of inhibiting the growth of M. arachidicola, S. turcica, B. maydis,
  and F. oxysporum, as distinct crescent-like invaginations could be seen around the
  paper disks. Yet it could not inhibit the growth of the pathogenic fungus V. mali.
  Protein in fraction d had a molecular size identical to that of the protein in fraction
  c, and it also possessed antifungal activity toward the same types of fungi, suggesting
  they are the same protein. Hokkaido large pinto bean defensin exerted strong activities
  toward M. arachidicola and B.maydis and a weaker activity toward S. turcica and
  F. oxysporum. The defensin had no antifungal effect on C. albicans at the concentration
  of 0.1 mg/mL.\n\nNowadays, many lectins from edible plants with potent antitumor
  activity have been discovered. For instance, legume lectin Con A induced apoptosis
  in human melanoma A375 cells. Momordica charantia lectin exerted an inhibitory action
  on nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells. Banana lectin demonstrated a suppressive effect
  on leukemia  and HepG2 cells. Broccolini lectin and taro lectin, etc., are all potential
  candidates as anticancer agents. P. vulgaris merits research efforts because of
  its relatively inexpensive price, multiple cultivar sources, and high potential
  in anticancer activity. As Hokkaido large pinto bean has not been investigated before,
  we selected it for the present study.\n\nBy applying affinity chromatography on
  Affi-gel blue gel and Blue Sepharose, ion exchange chromatography on SP-Sepharose,
  Mono Q, and Q Sepharose, and FPLC-gel filtration on Superdex 75 and Superdex 200,
  etc., a variety of lectins with protential were successfully purified from different
  organisms, such as lectins from jelly fish Nemopilema nomurai, bighead carp Aristichthys
  nobilis, coral Acropora millepora, Annona muricata seeds, and various P. vulgaris
  cultivars including French bean Indian cultivar, Blue Tiger King, jade bean, northeast
  red bean, and so on. The purification methods adopted in the present study can be
  used to obtain the target proteins in a fast and simple way. By using fewer purification
  steps, the loss of the target protein could be minimized. The purification efficiency
  and the percentage recovery of lectin, which is calculated using the formula percentage
  recovery =   100%, showed the yield of Hokkaido large pinto bean hemagglutinin was
  noteworthy in that 190 mg of hemagglutinin could be purified from 60 g of beans
  with 17% recovery. It may be due to the abundant occurrence of this storage protein
  in Hokkaido large pinto beans and the few steps of purification employed. Many lectins
  isolated from other cultivars of P. vulgaris may not have the same advantages. For
  instance, the yield of lectin from 100 g of French bean cultivar no. 12 was only
  4.8 mg with 18.1% recovery; the corresponding values for Anasazi beans were 26 mg
  and 14% recovery; and the values for French beans  were 96.25 mg and 18.73% recovery.
  Although larger amounts of lectin from other cultivars have been reported, for example,
  428 mg of brown kidney bean lectin from 100 g of beans with about 57% recovery,
  other advantages such as performance in assays of various biological activities
  should also be taken into consideration when assessing the utility/value of a protein.\n\nWith
  respect to structure and molecular size, Hokkaido large pinto bean hemagglutinin
  shared common characteristics with many lectins of P. vulgaris, which are dimeric
  proteins with a molecular mass of about 60 kDa. Yet there are exceptions, for example,
  a 94 kDa tetrameric lectin purified from the seeds of the Cacahuate cultivar of
  P. vulgaris. Despite these similar characteristics, hemagglutinins or lectins from
  different cultivars may perform distinctively regarding many biological activities,
  which may be due to the differences in their sequences. The N-terminal sequence
  is important for identifying a protein. By examining the N-terminal sequence, a
  number of P. vulgaris lectins have been identified. However, in this study no peaks
  were detected after seven sequencing cycles, indicating that the hemagglutinin most
  likely possessed a blocked N-terminus. This is not a unique case, as lectins of
  Castanea crenata, Schizophyllum commune, and Sclerotium rolfsii also had a blocked
  N-terminus.\n\nLectins or hemagglutinins from P. vulgaris possess different thermal
  and pH stabilities. For instance, lectin from jade bean had modest pH and heat stability:
  it was stable only at pH 4.59.4 and 3070 C, whereas lectins purified from Anasazi
  bean and the Indian cultivar of French bean manifested high pH and heat stability.
  They were stable at 80 and 90 C, respectively, and retained their hemagglutinating
  activity after treatment with solutions at pH 114 and 113, respectively. The high
  thermal stability may be due to the absence of disulfide linkages, which become
  unstable at elevated temperatures or attributed to the absence of heat-sensitive
  tryptophan residues. Some lectins had poor thermostability and pH stability, such
  as French bean cultivar no. 35, which retained its hemagglutinating activity at
  an ambient temperature below 50 C or at a pH within the range of 68. Hemagglutinin
  purified from Hokkaido large pinto bean was characterized by a modest thermostability
  and pH stability; it was stable at 3060 C and at pH values from 2 to 12. Considering
  its potential for application, it may be utilized as an agent for injection as it
  is stable at physiological temperature and pH in plasma. As the pH of gastric fluid
  ranges from 1 to 3, it still has a potential to be employed as a drug for oral administration
  even though its activity would be halved at pH 1.\n\nWith regard to carbohydrate
  selectivity, selected simple saccharides did not exert any inhibitory effect on
  the hemagglutinating activity of Hokkaido large pinto bean hemagglutinin. A number
  of lectins isolated from other P. vulgaris cultivars including cultivar 12, cultivar
  35, Indian cultivar of French beans, Hokkaido red bean, northeast red bean, etc.,
  also exhibited this common phenomenon. On the other hand, the sugar-binding ability
  of lectins of some other P. vulgaris cultivars has been discovered. For instance,
  lectin from cultivar no. 1 of French beans bound specifically to glucuronic acid,
  and lectins from both pinto beans and Extralong Autumn purple beans were galactose-specific.
  In addition, polysaccharides can also be the binding target of some lectins. For
  example, lectin isolated from Blue Tiger King bean was polygalacturonic acid-binding
  specific; meanwhile, the hemagglutinating activity of lectin from red kidney bean
  was reduced by several glycoproteins.\n\nLectins are found to be divalent cation-dependent
  proteins. During purification, they may lose ions or become desaturated with ions,
  which provides a rationale to the assay of the effect of metal ions in this study.
  Results displayed that metal ions including Ca2+, Zn2+, Mn2+, Cu2+, or Fe2+ ions
  enhanced the hemagglutinating activity of Hokkaido large pinto bean hemagglutinin
  at different concentrations, whereas Mg2+ ions failed to strengthen the diluted
  hemagglutinin to regain its hemagglutining capacity. Cu2+ or Fe2+ ions had the most
  obvious effect at the minimum concentration, followed by Mn2+ and Zn2+ ions, whereas
  Ca2+ ions were the least effective. It should be remembered that the effect of metal
  ion was uncertain. It was demonstrated that Ca2+, Zn2+, Mn2+, and Mg2+ had no effect
  on the hemagglutinating activity of Grifola frondosa lectin, whereas they restrained
  the lectin of Schizophyllum commune. This may be due to the change of protein structure
  in the presence of metal ions. For the P. vulgaris species, the effect on lectins
  varies among different cultivars. The activity of Con A, which is a well-known lectin
  isolated from jack beans, could be enhanced in the presence of Ca2+, Mg2+, and Mn2+
  ions. The potentiating effect of Ca2+ ions was not very commonly found and has been
  reported only for a few Phaseolus lectins, including P. coccineus lectin, P. lunatus
  lectin, and P. acutifolius lectin, which was probably because Ca2+ ions enable the
  lectins to resist tryptic proteolysis.\n\nFor antifungal activity, Hokkaido large
  pinto bean hemagglutinin did not affect the growth of the tested fungi. To date,
  it has been found that some lectins possess antifungal activity. For example, Aleuria
  aurantia lectin inhibited the growth of Mucor racemosus. French bean no. 35 lectin
  exhibited antifungal activity against V. mali, F. oxysporum, and Rhizoctonia solani.
  However, a number of lectins without antifungal effect have been reported, such
  as lectin from jade bean, Extralong Autumn purple bean, and ground bean etc.\n\nThe
  proliferation of several kinds of cancer cells encompassing hepatoma  cells, breast
  cancer  cells, and nasopharyngeal cancer  cells was reduced by Hokkaido large pinto
  bean hemagglutinin in a time- and dose-dependent manner, whereas its antiproliferative
  effect on MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell was only meager. The range of tumors cells
  found to be sensitive to Hokkaido large pinto bean hemagglutinin was large, compared
  to that of lectin purified from Blue Tiger King bean, which was specific toward
  HepG2 cells, as well as lectin from French bean cultivar no. 35, which was active
  toward MCF7 cells but not toward HepG2 cancer cells.\n\nThe anticancer effect of
  Hokkaido large pinto bean hemagglutinin in vitro was potent among many lectins that
  have been discovered to date. For instance, its IC50 values for HepG2, MCF7, and
  CNE2 cells after a 48 h exposure were 8.14, 6.07, and 7.49 M, respectively, which
  were much smaller in magnitude than that of acaconin from seeds of Acacia confusa
  ; jade bean lectin ; and Chinook salmon roe lectin, etc. Some lectins showed a similar
  antitumor activity, such as lectin from Lactarius flavidulus ; Nagaimo lectin significantly
  reduced the growth of MCF7, HepG2, and CNE2 cells after 24 h of treatment, with
  IC50 values of 3.17, 7.12, and 19.79 M, respectively. With the advantages of pH
  stability and strong anticancer acitivity, Hokkaido large pinto bean hemagglutinin
  has the potential to be developed as an antineoplastic agent.\n\nA summary of the
  properties of some P. vulgaris lectins  revealed that Hokkaido large pinto bean
  hemagglutinin manifested the advantageous features of a potent antiproliferative
  effect toward different types of cancer cells, a wider pH range over which it was
  stable, and a considerably higher yield, which demonstrate its potential as an anticancer
  candidate.\n\nThree types of chromatography including affinity chromatography, ion
  exchange chromatography, and FLPC-gel filtration were utilized for purification
  of defensin from Hokkaido large pinto beans. The protocol resembles purification
  procedures for some other defensins. It has been reported that plant defensins have
  been discovered to possess an isoelectric point around 89. This facilitates isolation
  of plant defensins by means of ion exchange chromatography: adsorption on cation
  exchangers and lack of binding to anion exchangers in neutral buffers  or acidic
  buffers.\n\nThe yield of the 10888 Da Hokkaido large pinto bean defensin was only
  3.2 mg from 60 g of beans. In other studies on purification of defensin, such as
  the purification of northeast red bean antifungal peptide, 8 mg of antifungal peptide
  was extracted from 100 g of beans. Higher yields were observed in the purification
  of defensin from Legumi secchi bean and ground bean, which were 43 and 14 mg from
  100 g of beans, respectively. However, a lower yield was also encountered in the
  purification of cloud bean defensin, which was 1.12 mg per 100 g of seeds.\n\nWith
  regard to its biological activity, Hokkaido large bean defensin displayed antifungal
  activity on different types of fungi including M. arachidicola, S. turcica, F. oxysporum,
  and B. maydis. However, fungi such as V. mali and C. albicans were resistant to
  Hokkaido large pinto bean defensin. In addition, most of the previously reported
  plant defensins were small proteins with a molecular size ranging from 5 to 9 kDa.
  With a molecular size of 10.888 kDa, Hokkaido large pinto bean defensin is a big
  defensin. Defensins with a large size also exist in animals. For instance, a 79-residue
  defensin, which is responsible for host defense, was found in the Japanese horseshoe
  crab.\n\nTo recapitulate, the pinto bean is an edible bean common in the United
  States and the Far East. The pH-stable and thermostable hemagglutinin, isolated
  with a remarkable yield, has potent antiproliferative activity toward various tumor
  cells including nasopharyngeal carcinoma, human breast cancer, and hepatoma  cells
  and thus noteworthy health-promoting activity. Currently there are not many publications
  reporting the action of lectins against nasopharyngeal cancer cells. The isolated
  defensin has a larger molecular weight than previously reported defensins and antifungal
  activity toward various phytopathogenic fungi and could be used in the biological
  control of agriculturally important fungi. It deserves mention that by comparison
  some antifungal proteins have activity against only one or two fungal species.\n\nSupplementary
