  down-regulation plays a key role in silibinin-induced autophagy and apoptosis in
  human breast cancer MCF-7 cells.md
text: '


  The estrogen receptor alpha  has been proven to be one of the most important therapeutic
  targets in breast cancer over the last 30 years. Previous studies pointed out that
  a natural flavonoid, silibinin, induced apoptosis in human breast cancer MCF-7 cells.
  In the present study we report that exposure of MCF-7 cells to silibinin led to
  cell death through the down-regulation of ER expression. Silibinin-induced apoptosis
  of MCF-7 cells through up-regulation of caspase 6 due to ER signalling repression
  was further boosted by ER antagonist. Moreover, up-regulation of autophagy induced
  by silibinin accounted for apoptotic exacerbation, being further enhanced by ER
  inhibition. Upon ER activation, series of downstream signalling pathways can be
  activated. We found that silibinin reduced the expressions of Akt/mTOR and extracellular-signal-related
  kinase, which respectively accounted for the induction of autophagy and apoptosis.
  These effects were further augmented by co-treatment with ER inhibitor. We conclude
  that the treatment with silibinin of ER-positive MCF-7 cells down-regulates the
  expression of ER, and subsequently mTOR and ERK signaling pathways, ER downstream,
  finally resulting in induction of autophagy and apoptosis.'
