  olive oil and corn oil differentially affect experimental breast cancer through
  distinct modulation of the p21Ra.md
text: '


  Extra-virgin olive oil  has been hypothesized to have chemopreventive effects on
  breast cancer, unlike high corn oil  diets that stimulate it. We have investigated
  mechanisms of these differential modulatory actions on experimental mammary cancer.
  In 7,12-dimethylbenzanthracene adenocarcinomas of rats fed a high EVOO, HCO and
  control diets, we have analyzed the expression and activity of ErbB receptors, p21Ras
  and its extracellular signal-regulated kinase  1/2, Akt and RalA/B effectors by
  immunoblotting analyses. We explored the Ha-ras1 mutation status by Southern blot,
  mismatch amplification mutation assay and sequencing, and the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme
  A reductase and squalene synthase messenger RNA expression by real-time polymerase
  chain reaction. We analyzed the tumor mitotic index, proliferating cell nuclear
  antigen  levels, and apoptosis through Caspase-3 analysis and terminal deoxynucleotidyl
  transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end labeling assays. Finally,
  we measured the 8-oxo-2-deoxyguanosine levels. Non-parametrical statistics were
  used. The EVOO diet decreased Ras activation, downregulated the Ras/phosphatidyl
  inositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway and upregulated the Raf/Erk pathway, compared with
  the control. In contrast, the HCO diet did not modify Ras activity but rather enhanced
  the Raf/Erk pathway. The EVOO diet decreased the cleaved ErbB4 levels, compared
  with the HCO diet, increased apoptosis and diminished the mono-ubiquitylated PCNA
  levels, which is related to DNA damage. Tumors from rats fed the EVOO diet displayed
  a more benign phenotype, whereas those from rats fed the HCO diet were biologically
  more aggressive. In conclusion, high EVOO and corn oil diets exert their modulatory
  effects on breast cancer through a different combination of Ras signaling pathways,
  a different proliferationapoptosis balance and probably distinct levels of DNA damage. '
