  Dietary Canola Oil Suppresses Growth of Mammary Carcinogenesis in Female Rat Offspring.md
text: '


  As suggested by rodent studies and studies using human breast cancer cells, dietary
  canola oil is linked with lower breast cancer risk. Here, we investigated the effect
  of maternal  dietary canola oil on the susceptibility of female Sprague-Dawley rat
  offspring to mammary carcinogenesis. Although the control diet had 10% soybean oil,
  the treatment diet was formulated to contain 10% canola oil as a fat source. N-nitroso-N-methylurea
  was injected to induce mammary cancer in offspring. The offspring of canola-fed
  dams showed significantly decreased tumor multiplicity  and tumor volume, along
  with increased survival rate. In addition, the mRNA expression of development-related
  gamma-glutamyltransferase 1 was significantly higher in the lactating mammary tissues
  of the canola group dams and mammary tumor tissues of the offspring. These results
  suggest a potential anticancer effect of maternal dietary canola oil and may be
  useful in devising prenatal nutritional strategies to reduce breast cancer risk
  in humans.'
