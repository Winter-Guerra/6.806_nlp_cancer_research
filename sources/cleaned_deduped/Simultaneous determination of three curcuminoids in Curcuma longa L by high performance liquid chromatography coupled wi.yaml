text: '


  A novel method for analysis of three active components curcumin, demethoxycurcumin
  and bisdemethoxycurcumin in Curcuma longa L. was developed by HPLC coupled with
  electrochemical detection. Three curcuminoids were well separated on a C18 column
  and detected with high sensitivity. A mobile phase containing acetonitrile and 10
  mM Na2HPO4-H3PO4   was used. Good linearity was obtained in the range of 0.208-41.6,
  0.197-39.4, and 0.227-114 M for curcumin, demethoxycurcumin and bisdemethoxycurcumin
  respectively. The limit of detection reached up to 108 M, which was lower than that
  by UV detection. The relative standard deviations  ranged from 1.06% to 1.88% for
  intra-day precision and from 4.30% to 5.79% for inter-day precision, respectively.
  The proposed method has been applied in real herb sample and recoveries ranging
  from 86.3% to 111% were obtained.'
