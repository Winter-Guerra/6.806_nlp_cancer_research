  to demonstrate chemoprevention by the monoterpene perillyl alcohol during early
  rat hepatocarcinogenesis a cauti.md

  The monoterpene perillyl alcohol  is being considered as a useful chemopreventive
  and therapeutic agent against human cancers. However, no data are available on the
  effects of PA in the first stages of hepatocarcinogenesis. To study such effects,
  putatively initiated cells and preneoplastic foci in hepatocarcinogenesis were used
  as a model. Male Wistar rats were treated with a single dose of N-nitrosomorpholine.
  Between days 4 and 91 after NNM, subgroups of rats received either PA  or phenobarbital   in
  the diet. Since PA treatment reduced food intake, one control group was fed ad libitum,
  while a second control was pair fed between days 4 and 91. In order to enhance any
  treatment effects, all groups, including the controls, were treated with the potent
  tumor promoter PB after day 91 until the end of the experiment at day 266. Rats
  were killed at multiple time points and putatively initiated cells and preneoplastic
  foci were identified by staining positively for placental glutathione S-transferase.
  The following results were obtained.  A few days after NNM treatment single G+ cells
  emerged; a considerable portion of which developed into foci.  Treatment with PB
  resulted in an increase in number and size of G+ foci.  PA treatment failed to reduce
  the number of G+ cells; it somewhat lowered rates of apoptosis in G+ foci and clearly
  increased their average size.  Eighty-seven days of PA revealed no protective effect
  on day 266, but, similar to PB treatment, increased the growth of foci. In conclusion,
  PA exerted no detectable chemopreventive effect in the early stages of rat hepatocarcinogenesis.
  It rather exerted a PB-like tumor promoting activity. These data argue against a
  recommendation of PA as a chemopreventive agent for healthy humans. '
