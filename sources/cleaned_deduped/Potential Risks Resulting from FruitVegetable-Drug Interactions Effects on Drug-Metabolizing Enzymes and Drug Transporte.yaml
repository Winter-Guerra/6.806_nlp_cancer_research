  Risks Resulting from FruitVegetable-Drug Interactions Effects on Drug-Metabolizing
  Enzymes and Drug Transporte.md
text: "\n\nAbstract:  It has been well established that complex mixtures of phytochemicals
  in fruits and vegetables can be beneficial for human health. Moreover, it is becoming
  increasingly apparent that phytochemicals can influence the pharmacological activity
  of drugs by modifying their absorption characteristics through interactions with
  drug transporters as well as drug-metabolizing enzyme systems. Such effects are
  more likely to occur in the intestine and liver, where high concentrations of phytochemicals
  may occur. Alterations in cytochrome P450 and other enzyme activities may influence
  the fate of drugs subject to extensive first-pass metabolism. Although numerous
  studies of nutrient-drug interactions have been published and systematic reviews
  and meta-analyses of these studies are available, no generalizations on the effect
  of nutrient-drug interactions on drug bioavailability are currently available. Several
  publications have highlighted the unintended consequences of the combined use of
  nutrients and drugs. Many phytochemicals have been shown to have pharmacokinetic
  interactions with drugs. The present review is limited to commonly consumed fruits
  and vegetables with significant beneficial effects as nutrients and components in
  folk medicine. Here, we discuss the phytochemistry and pharmacokinetic interactions
  of the following fruit and vegetables: grapefruit, orange, tangerine, grapes, cranberry,
  pomegranate, mango, guava, black raspberry, black mulberry, apple, broccoli, cauliflower,
  watercress, spinach, tomato, carrot, and avocado. We conclude that our knowledge
  of the potential risk of nutrient-drug interactions is still limited. Therefore,
  efforts to elucidate potential risks resulting from food-drug interactions should
  be intensified in order to prevent undesired and harmful clinical consequences.\n\nDietary
  habits are an important modifiable environmental factor influencing human health
  and disease. Epidemiologic evidence suggests that regular consumption of fruits
  and vegetables may reduce risk of some diseases, including cancer. These properties
  have been attributed to foods that are rich sources of numerous bioactive compounds
  such as phytochemicals. Modifying the intake of specific foods and/or their bioactive
  components seems to be a prudent, noninvasive, and cost-effective strategy for preventing
  some diseases in people who appear to be healthy. As will be discussed in this article,
  potential problems occur when patients taking medicines regularly also consume certain
  fruits or vegetables.\n\nThousands of drugs are commercially available and a great
  percentage of the population takes at least one pharmacologically active agent on
  a regular basis. Given this magnitude of use and variability in individual nutritional
  status, dietary habits, and food composition, there is a high potential for drug-nutrient
  interactions. However, there is a relatively short list of documented fruit/vegetable-drug
  interactions, necessitating further, and extensive clinical evaluation. Healthcare
  providers, such as physicians, pharmacists, nurses, and dietitians, have to be aware
  of important food-drug interactions in order to optimize the therapeutic efficacy
  of prescribed and over-the-counter drugs. Here, we review some of the most widely
  consumed fruits and vegetables to inform healthcare providers of possible nutrient-drug
  interactions and their potential clinical significance.\n\nThere are numerous patients
  who encounter increased risks of adverse events associated with drug-nutrient interactions.
  These include elderly patients, patients with cancer and/or malnutrition, gastrointestinal
  tract dysfunctions, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, and chronic diseases that
  require the use of multiple drugs, as well as those receiving enteral nutrition
  or transplants. Therefore, the main reason for devoting a major review to nutrient-drug
  interactions is the enormous importance of fruits and vegetables used for their
  beneficial effects as nutrients and as components in folk medicine. There are currently
  few studies that combine a nutrient-based and detailed pharmacological approach,
  or studies that systematically explore the risk and benefits of fruit and vegetables.\n\nA
  drug-nutrient interaction is defined as the result of a physical, chemical, physiological,
  or pathophysiological relationship between a drug and a nutrient. An interaction
  is considered significant from a clinical perspective if it alters the therapeutic
  response. Food-drug interactions can result in 2 main clinical effects: the decreased
  bioavailability of a drug, which predisposes to treatment failure, or an increased
  bioavailability, which increases the risk of adverse events and may even precipitate
  toxicities.\n\nFigure 1-.  Drug-fruit/vegetable interaction and effects on bioavailability
  of drugs. During the consumption of drugs with fruits or vegetables, the ADME properties
  of drug  can be modified by drug-phytochemical interaction. As a result of this,
  interaction can be increased or decreased plasma concentrations of a drug that can
  lead to the presence of adverse events or treatment failure.\n\nNutritional status
  and diet can affect drug action by altering metabolism and function. In addition,
  various dietary components can have pharmacological activity under certain circumstances.
  For healthy-treatment intervention, it is necessary to understand how these drug-food
  interactions can induce a beneficial result or lead to detrimental therapeutic conditions.
  Drug-drug interactions are widely recognized and evaluated as part of the drug-approval
  process, whether pharmaceutical, pharmacokinetic, or pharmacodynamic in nature.
  Equal attention must be paid to food-drug interactions.\n\nThere are 4 types of
  accepted drug-food interactions based on their nature and mechanisms.\n\nType I
  is ex vivo bioinactivations, which refer to interactions between the drug and the
  nutritional element or formulation through biochemical or physical reactions, such
  as hydrolysis, oxidation, neutralization, precipitation, or complexation. These
  interactions usually occur in the delivery device.\n\nType II interactions affect
  absorption. They cause either an increase or decrease in the oral bioavailability
  of a drug. The precipitant agent may modify the function of enzymes or transport
  mechanisms that are responsible for biotransformation.\n\nType III interactions
  affect the systemic or physiologic disposition and occur after the drug or the nutritional
  element has been absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and entered the systemic
  circulation. Changes in the cellular or tissue distribution, systemic transport,
  or penetration to specific organs or tissues can occur.\n\nType IV interactions
  refer to the elimination or clearance of drugs or nutrients, which may involve the
  antagonism, impairment, or modulation of renal and/or enterohepatic elimination.\n\nDrug-metabolizing
  enzymes and drug transporters play important roles in modulating drug absorption,
  distribution, metabolism, and elimination. Acting alone or in concert with each
  other, they can affect the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a drug. The
  interplay between drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters is one of the confounding
  factors that have been recently shown to contribute to potential complex drug interactions.\n\nThe
  oral administration of drugs to patients is convenient, practical, and preferred
  for many reasons. Oral administration of drugs, however, may lead to limited and
  variable oral bioavailability because of absorption across the intestinal barrier.
  Drug absorption across the gastrointestinal tract is highly dependent on affinity
  for membrane transporters as well as lipophilicity. On the other hand, the liver
  plays a key role in the clearance and excretion of many drugs. Hepatic transporters
  are membrane proteins that primarily facilitate nutrient and endogenous substrate
  transport into the cell via uptake transporters, or protect the cell by pumping
  out toxic chemicals via canalicular transporters. Consequently, drug transporters
  in both the gut and the liver are important in determining oral drug disposition
  by controlling absorption and bioavailability.\n\nThe major uptake transporters
  responsible for nutrient and xenobiotic transport, both uptake and efflux transporters,
  belong to the 2 solute carrier  superfamilies. The SLC superfamily encompasses a
  variety of transporters, including the organic anion transporters, the organic cation
  transporters, the electroneutral organic cation transporters, the equilibrative
  nucleoside transporters, the concentrative nucleoside transporters, the apical Na+-dependent
  bile salt transporter, the monocarboxylate transporters, and the peptide transporters.
  The SLCO family is made up of the organic anion transporting polypeptides. Efflux
  transporters expressed in the intestine and liver include P-glycoprotein, bile salt
  export pump, multidrug resistance proteins, and breast cancer resistance protein,
  all members of the ATP-binding cassette superfamily. Members of this superfamily
  use ATP as an energy source, allowing them to pump substrates against a concentration
  gradient. In the liver, uptake transporters are mainly expressed in the sinusoid,
  and excretion transporters are mainly expressed on the lateral and canalicular membranes.
  There are transporters on the lateral membrane the primary function of which is
  pumping drugs back into the blood circulation from the hepatocytes. Nowadays, a
  large amount of work has identified and characterized intestinal and hepatic transporters
  in regards to tissue expression profiles, regulation, mechanisms of transport, substrate
  and inhibitor profiles, species differences, and genetic polymorphisms. Given the
  circumstances outlined above, there is no doubt of the overall relevance of drug
  transport for clinical pharmacokinetics.\n\nUntil recently, little regard was given
  to the possibility that food and food components could cause significant changes
  to the extent of drug absorption via effects on intestinal and liver transporters.
  It is now well known that drug-food interactions might affect the pharmacokinetics
  of prescribed drugs when coadministered with food. Common foods, such as fruits
  and vegetables, contain a large variety of secondary metabolites known as phytochemicals,
  many of which have been associated with health benefits. However, we know little
  about the processes through which these phytochemicals  are absorbed into the body,
  reach their biological target, and are eliminated. Recent studies show that some
  of these phytochemicals are substrates and modulators of specific members of the
  superfamily of ABC transporting proteins. Indeed, in vitro and preclinical data
  in rats suggest that a variety of foodstuffs, including herbal teas  and vegetables
  and herbs, can modulate the activity of drug transporters. It is not yet known whether
  these effects are predictive of what will be observed clinically.\n\nFigure 3-.
  \ Chemical structures of the major phytochemicals present in fruit and vegetables.\n\nIt
  has been shown that, before reaching the systemic circulation, the metabolism of
  orally ingested drugs  has clinically relevant influences on the potency and efficacy
  of drugs. Both the intestine and liver account for the presystemic metabolism in
  humans. Drug metabolism reactions are generally grouped into 2 phases. Phase I reactions
  involve changes such as oxidation, reduction, and hydrolysis and are primarily mediated
  by the cytochrome P450  family of enzymes. Phase II reactions use an endogenous
  compound such as glucuronic acid, glutathione, or sulfate, to conjugate with the
  drug or its phase I-derived metabolite to produce a more polar end product that
  can be more readily excreted.\n\nThe CYP enzymes involved in drug metabolism in
  humans are expressed predominantly in the liver. However, they are also present
  in the large and small intestine, lungs, and brain. CYP proteins are categorized
  into families and subfamilies and can metabolize almost any organic xenobiotic.
  CYP enzymes combined with drug transport proteins constitute the first-pass effect
  of orally administered drugs. On the other hand, the phase II drug-metabolizing
  or conjugating enzymes consist of many enzyme superfamilies, including sulfotransferases,
  UDP-glucuronosyltransferases, DT-diaphorase or NADH:quinone oxidoreductase  or NADH:
  menadione reductase, epoxide hydrolases, glutathione S-transferases, and N-acetyltransferases.
  The conjugation reactions by phase II drug-metabolizing enzymes increase hydrophilicity
  and thereby enhance excretion in the bile and/or the urine and consequently affect
  detoxification.\n\nThe metabolism of a drug can be altered by foreign chemicals
  and such interactions can often be clinically significant. The most common form
  of drug interactions entail a foreign chemical acting either as an inhibitor or
  an inducer of the CYP enzyme isoform responsible for metabolizing an administered
  medicinal drug, subsequently leading to an unusually slow or fast clearance of said
  drug. Inhibition of drug metabolism will result in a concentration elevation in
  tissues, leading to various adverse reactions, particularly for drugs with a low
  therapeutic index.\n\nOften, influence on drug metabolism by compounds that occur
  in the environment, most remarkably foodstuffs, is bypassed. Dietary changes can
  alter the expression and activity of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes. Although
  this can lead to alterations in the systemic elimination kinetics of drugs metabolized
  by these enzymes, the magnitude of the change is generally small. Metabolic food-drug
  interactions occur when a certain food alters the activity of a drug-metabolizing
  enzyme, leading to a modulation of the pharmacokinetics of drugs metabolized by
  the enzyme. Foods, such as fruits, vegetables, alcoholic beverages, teas, and herbs,
  which consist of complex chemical mixtures, can inhibit or induce the activity of
  drug-metabolizing enzymes.\n\nThe observed induction and inhibition of CYP enzymes
  by natural products in the presence of a prescribed drug has  led to the general
  acceptance that natural therapies can have adverse effects, contrary to popular
  beliefs in countries with active ethnomedicinal practices. Herbal medicines, such
  as St. Johns wort, garlic, piperine, ginseng, and gingko, which are freely available
  over the counter, have given rise to serious clinical interactions when coadministered
  with prescription medicines. Such adversities have spurred various preclinical and
  in vitro investigations on a series of other herbal remedies, with their clinical
  relevance yet to be established. The CYP3A4-related interaction based on food component
  is the best known; it might be related to the high level of expression of CYP3A4
  in the small intestine, as well as its broad substrate specificity. If we consider
  that CYP3A4 is responsible for the metabolism of more than 50% of clinical pharmaceuticals,
  all nutrient-drug interactions should be considered clinically relevant, in which
  case all clinical studies of drugs should include a food-drug interaction screening.\n\nFruits
  and vegetables are known to be important components in a healthy diet, since they
  have low energy density and are sources of micronutrients, fiber, and other components
  with functional properties, called phytochemicals. Increased fruit and vegetable
  consumption can also help displace food high in saturated fats, sugar, or salt.
  Low fruit and vegetable intake is among the top 10 risk factors contributing to
  mortality. According to the World Health Organization, increased daily fruit and
  vegetable intake could help prevent major chronic noncommunicable diseases. Evidence
  is emerging that specific combinations of phytochemicals may be far more effective
  in protecting against some diseases than isolated compounds. Observed drug-phytochemical
  interactions, in addition to interactions among dietary micronutrients, indicate
  possibilities for improved therapeutic strategies. However, several reports have
  examined the effects of plant foods and herbal medicines on drug bioavailability.
  As shown in Table 3 and 4 and as discussed below, we have surveyed the literature
  to identify reports suggesting important food and phytochemical modulation of drug-metabolizing
  enzymes and drug transporters leading to potential important nutrient-drug interactions.
  \ \n\nThe interaction of grapefruit with certain drugs was unintentionally discovered
  2 decades ago. Since then, there have been numerous reports on the effects of grapefruit
  and its components on CYP450 drug oxidation and transportation. Several findings
  showed that grapefruit juice had a major effect on the intestinal CYP system with
  a minor effect at the hepatic level. The predominant mechanism for this interaction
  is the inhibition of cytochrome P450 3A4 in the small intestine, which results in
  a significant reduction of drug presystemic metabolism. Grapefruit juice intake
  has been found to decrease CYP3A4 mRNA activity through a post transcriptional activity,
  possibly by facilitating degradation of the enzyme. An additional mechanism may
  be the inhibition of Pgp- and MRP2-mediated drug efflux, transporters that carry
  drugs from enterocytes back to the gut lumen, all of which results in a further
  increase in the fraction of drug absorbed and increased systemic drug bioavailability.
  It has also been reported that the major constituents of grapefruit significantly
  inhibit the OATP-B function in vitro.\n\nThe interaction between grapefruit juice
  and drugs has been potentially ascribed to a number of constituents. It has been
  suggested that flavonoids, such as naringin, naringenin, quercetin, and kaempferol,
  major components in grapefruit, are responsible for drug interaction. Some of these
  chemicals are also found in other fruit juices. Pomegranate, for example, shares
  certain properties with grapefruit, suggesting that both could modify the bioavailability
  of drugs. Another group of compounds that have been detected in grapefruit juice
  are the furanocoumarins, which are known to be mechanism-based inactivators of CYP450.
  The major furanocoumarin present in grapefruit is bergamottin, which demonstrated
  a time- and concentration-dependent inactivation of CYP enzymes in vitro. One interesting
  characteristic of this interaction is that grapefruit juice does not need to be
  taken simultaneously with the medication in order to produce the interaction. The
  bioavailability of drugs has been reported to be doubled by grapefruit juice, even
  when taken 12 h after ingestion. Colored grapefruit juice and white grapefruit juice
  are equally effective in producing drug interactions.\n\nThis inhibitory interaction
  should be kept in mind when prescribing drugs metabolized by CYP3A4. Examples of
  drugs affected by grapefruit or its components include calcium-channel antagonists
  such as felodipine, nisoldipine, amlodipines, verapamil, and diltiazem ; central
  nervous system modulators including diazepam, triazolam, midazolam, alprazolam,
  carbamazepine, buspurone, and sertraline ; HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors such as
  simvastatin, lovastatin, atorvastatin, and pravastatin ; immunosuppressants such
  as cyclosporine ; antivirals such as saquinavir ; a phosphodiesterases-5 inhibitor
  such as sildenafil ; antihistamines including as terfenadine and fexofenadine ;
  antiarhythmics such as amiodarone ; and antibiotics such as eritromicine.\n\nEpidemiologic
  studies reveal that approximately 2% of the population in the United States consumes
  at least one glass of regular strength grapefruit juice per day. This becomes pertinent
  if we consider that many people suffer from chronic metabolic diseases  and receive
  calcium-channel antagonis therapy and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. Patients with
  mental disorders also chronically receive central nervous system modulators. In
  the case of many drugs, an increase in serum drug concentration has been associated
  with increased frequency of dose-dependent adverse effects. In light of the wide
  ranging effects of grapefruit juice on the pharmacokinetics of various drugs, physicians
  need to be aware of these interactions and should make an attempt to warn and educate
  patients regarding the potential consequences of concomitant ingestion of these
  agents.\n\nConsumption of most types of orange juice does not appear to alter CYP3A4
  activity in vivo. However, orange juice made from Seville oranges appears to be
  somewhat similar to grapefruit juice and can affect the pharmacokinetics of CYP3A4
  substrates. It has been previously shown that consumption of a single 240-mL serving
  of Sevilla orange juice resulted in a 76% increase in felodipine exposure, comparable
  to what is observed after grapefruit juice consumption. Presumably, the mechanism
  of this effect is similar to that of grapefruit juice-mediated interactions, because
  Sevilla orange contains significant concentrations of flavonoids, mainly bergamottin
  and 6,7-dihydroxybergamottin. Orange juice has also been shown to exert inhibitory
  effects on Pgp-mediated drug efflux. Takanaga and others showed that 3,3,4,5,6,7,8-heptamethoxyflavon
  and tangeretin were the major Pgp inhibitors present in orange juice and showed
  that another component, nobiletin, was also a Pgp inhibitor. Therefore, the intake
  of orange juice might inhibit the efflux transporters by Pgp, which could enhance
  the bioavailability of drugs and thus lead to an increase in the risk of adverse
  events.\n\nIt has also been observed that components of orange juice--naringin in
  particular--are in vitro inhibitors of OATP transport activity. Dresser and others
  have previously reported that orange juice inhibits the function of human OATP-A
  \ in vitro. OATP-A, however, is predominantly expressed in the brain, but not in
  the intestine. On the other hand, Satoh and others reported that OATP-B-mediated
  uptake of glibenclamide as well as estrone-3-sulfate was significantly inhibited
  by 5% orange juice. Orange juice might reduce the intestinal absorption of substrates
  of OATP-B, resulting in a decrease in concentration in the blood.\n\nPrevious studies
  in humans using fexofenadine as a probe showed that oral coadministration with orange
  juice decreased the oral bioavailability of fexofenadine. Orange juice and its constituents
  were shown to interact with members of the OATP transporter family by reducing their
  activities. The functional consequences of such an interaction are reflected in
  a significant reduction in the oral bioavailability of fexofenadine, possibly by
  preferential direct inhibition of intestinal OATP activity. Other reports indicate
  that orange juice slightly reduced the absorption of ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin,
  and celiprolol. A study of an interaction between orange juice and pravastatin showed
  an increase in area under curve. Orange juice also moderately reduces the bioavailability
  of atenolol, which may necessitate a dose adjustment.\n\nEarly studies demonstrated
  the influence of tangeretin, a flavonoid found in high levels in tangerine juice,
  on drug-metabolizing liver enzymes. It was demonstrated that tangeretin inhibits
  P450 1A2 and P450 3A4 activity in human liver microsomes. Tangeretin is a potent
  regioselective stimulator of midazolam 1-hydroxylation by human liver microsomes
  CYP3A4. Although clinical studies have shown no influence on midazolam pharmacokinetics
  in vivo, further studies are needed to evaluate its effects on other drugs. Diosmin
  is one of the main components of citrus fruits, such as tangerine. Diosmin may increase
  the absorption or bioavailability of coadministered drugs able to serve as Pgp substrates.
  As a result, some caution may be required with its clinical use.\n\nGrapes are one
  of the most valued conventional fruits worldwide. The grape is considered a source
  of unique and potentially useful medicinal natural products; they are also used
  in the manufacturing of various industrial products. The main biologically active
  and well-characterized constituent from the grape is resveratrol, which is known
  for various medicinal properties in treating human diseases. Resveratrol was shown
  to be an irreversible  inhibitor of CYP3A4 and a noncompetitive reversible inhibitor
  for CYP2E1 in microsomes from rat liver and human liver cells containing cDNA-expressed
  CYPs. Resveratrol is an electron-rich molecule with 2 aromatic benzene rings linked
  by an ethylene bridge. CYP3A-mediated aromatic hydroxylation and epoxidation of
  resveratrol are possible, resulting in a reactive p-benzoquinone methide metabolite
  that is capable of binding covalently to CYP3A4, leading to inactivation, and potential
  drug interactions.\n\nAmerican cranberry is a fruit used as a prophylactic agent
  against urinary tract infections. Drug interactions with cranberry juice might be
  related to the fact that the juice is rich in flavonol glycosides, anthocyanins,
  proanthocyanidins, and organic and phenolic acids. Izzo  described a total of 8
  cases of interaction between cranberry juice and warfarin, leading to changes in
  international normalized ratio  values, and bleeding. The mechanism behind this
  interaction might be the inhibition by cranberry flavonoids of CYP3A4 and/or CYP2C9
  enzymes, which are responsible for warfarin metabolism.\n\nIt has also been shown
  that cranberry juice inhibits diclofenac metabolism in human liver microsomes, but
  this has not been demonstrated clinically in human subjects. Cranberry juice may
  increase the bioavailability of CYP3A4 substrates  as discussed by Van den Bout-Van
  den Beukel and others. Uesawa and Mohri have demonstrated that nifedipine metabolism
  in rat intestinal and human hepatic microsomes are inhibited by preincubation with
  cranberry juice. Furthermore, cranberry juice increased the nifedipine concentration
  in rat plasma. These findings suggest that cranberry juice might affect the plasma
  concentration of nifedipine in humans as well.\n\nPomegranate is commonly eaten
  around the world and has been used in folk medicine for a wide variety of therapeutic
  purposes. Pomegranate is a rich source of several chemicals such as pectin, tannins,
  flavonoids, and anthocyanins. Hidaka and others  have reported that pomegranate
  juice influenced the pharmacokinetics of carbamazepine in rats by inhibiting enteric
  CYP3A activity. Such inhibition of the enteric CYP3A activity by a single exposure
  to pomegranate juice appears to last for approximately 3 d. Nagata and others  found
  that pomegranate juice inhibited human CYP2C9 activity and increased tolbutamide
  bioavailability in rats. Recently, pomegranate juice was shown to potently inhibit
  the sulfoconjugation of 1-naphthol in Caco-2 cells. Saruwatari and others have suggested
  that some constituents of pomegranate juice, most probably punicalagin, may impair
  the metabolic functions of the intestine  and therefore might have effects upon
  the bioavailability of drugs.\n\nThe beneficial effects of mango include anti-inflammatory
  and antimicrobial activities. Preliminary phytochemical screening revealed the presence
  of flavonoids, including quercetin and glycosylated xanthones such as mangiferin.
  Quercetin has been shown to possess antioxidant, antimicrobial, antitumor, antihypertensive,
  antiatherosclerosis, and anti-inflammatory properties. In a series of studies, Rodeiro
  and others have shown the effects of mango on drug-metabolizing enzymes and drug
  transporters. They found that exposure of hepatocytes to mango extract produced
  a significant reduction  in 7-methoxyresorufin-O-demethylase  activity and an increase
  \ in 7-penthoxyresorufin-O-depentylase  activity. This group also studied the effect
  of mangiferin on CYP enzymes and found that mangiferin reduced the activities of
  5 P450s: POD, midazolam 1-hydroxylation, diclofenac 4-hydroxylation, S-mephenytoin
  4-hydroxylation, and chlorzoxazone 6-hydroxyaltion. Recently, mango and mango-derived
  polyphenols have been shown to potentially affect the activity of the multidrug
  transporter Pgp ABCB1. These findings suggest that mango and its components inhibit
  the major human P450 enzymes involved in drug metabolism and some transporters.
  The potential for drug interactions with mango fruit should therefore be considered.\n\nGuava
  is an important food crop and medicinal plant in tropical and subtropical countries;
  it is widely used as food and in folk medicine around the world. A number of metabolites,
  such as phenolics, flavonoid, carotenoid, terpenoid, and triterpene, have been found
  in this fruit. Extracts and metabolites of this plant, particularly those from the
  leaves and fruit, possess useful pharmacological activities. There is only one report
  about the effect of guava extracts on drug transport: guava extract showed a potent
  inhibitory effect on Pgp-mediated efflux in Caco-2 cells. It was also found to inhibit
  efflux transport from serosal to mucosal surfaces in the rat ileum. This means that
  guava could interact with Pgp substrates, such as digoxin, fexofenadine, indinavir,
  vincristine, colchicine, topotecan, and paclitaxel, in the small intestine. For
  this reason, this fruit should be consumed with caution by patients taking medicines.\n\nBerries
  have been shown to have a positive impact on several chronic conditions including
  obesity, cancer, and cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. Like other fruits,
  raspberries contain micro- and macronutrients such as vitamins, minerals, and fiber.
  Their biological properties, however, have been largely attributed to high levels
  of various phenolic compounds, as well as the interactive synergies among their
  natural phytochemical components. Raspberry or raspberry constituents have antioxidant
  and anti-inflammatory properties and inhibit cancer cell growth. Black raspberries
  \ have been called the king of berries for their superior health benefits, whereas
  black mulberry  is most commonly used for its antioxidants properties and for its
  high bioactive content of phenolics, anthocyanins, and gallic acid. It has been
  shown that black raspberry and black mulberry are able to inhibit the human CYP3A-catalyzed
  midazolam 1-hydroxylation activity in liver microsomes, and the inhibitory effects
  are somewhat greater than those of pomegranate. It has also been reported that black
  mulberry extract potently inhibits OATP-B function at concentrations that seem to
  be physiologically relevant in vitro. These results suggest that black raspberry
  and black mulberry may decrease the plasma concentrations of concomitantly ingested
  OATP-B substrate drugs or increase the plasma concentration levels of concomitantly
  ingested CYP3A-substrate drugs. In vivo studies on the interaction between black
  mulberry and black raspberry and CYP3A substrates are needed to determine whether
  inhibition of CYP3A activity by fruit juices is clinically relevant.\n\nApple and
  its products contain high amounts of polyphenols, which show diverse biological
  activities and may contribute to beneficial health effects such as protecting the
  intestine against inflammation due to chronic inflammatory bowel diseases. Pohl
  and others  found that apple juice extract inhibits CYP1A1 at levels of CYP1A1 mRNA,
  protein, and enzymatic activity. On the other hand, it has also been reported that
  apple juice and its constituents can interact with members of the OATP transporter
  family  by reducing their activities in vitro. The functional consequence of such
  an interaction was a significant reduction in the oral bioavailability of fexofenadine
  in human plasma levels, possibly by preferential direct inhibition of intestinal
  OATP activity. These findings suggest that apple might interact with OATP substrates.\n\nBroccoli
  \ and cauliflower  are unique among the common cruciferous vegetables that contain
  high levels of the aliphatics glucosinolate and glucoraphanin. Upon hydrolysis,
  glucoraphanin produces several products that include the bioactive isothiocyanate
  sulforaphane. The percentage of isothiocyanate sulforaphane present in these vegetables
  may vary depending on conditions of hydrolysis, food handling, and preparation procedures.
  In animal studies, dietary freeze-dried broccoli was found to offer protection against
  several cancers. However, broccoli, cauliflower, and their glucosinolate hydrolysis
  products have been shown to induce phase I and phase II drug-metabolizing enzymes
  in intact liver cells from both rats and humans. The isothiocyanate sulforaphane
  decreased the enzyme activities hepatocytes associated with CYP1A1 and 2B1/2, namely
  ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase and pentoxyresorufin-O-dealkylase, respectively, in
  a dose-dependent manner. An increase in hGSTA1/2 mRNA has been observed in isothiocyanate
  sulforaphane-treated human hepatocytes, whereas the expression of CYP3A4, the major
  CYP in the human liver, markedly decreased at both mRNA and activity levels. Conversely,
  it was recently shown that sulforaphane induces mRNA levels of MRP1 and MRP2 in
  primary hepatocytes and Caco-2 cells. It has been additionally reported that broccoli
  is able to induce the activity of phenolsulfotransferases. These results suggest
  that other vegetables with a high content of isothiocyanates, such as those of the
  family Cruciferae  and the genus Raphanus  may have pharmacological and toxicological
  implications in humans.\n\nWatercress is another important member of the cruciferous
  vegetables, an excellent source for glucosinolates, and other bioactive phytochemicals.
  Watercress  is an exceptionally rich dietary source of beta-phenylethyl isothiocyanate.
  Previous studies by Leclercq and others  have shown that a single ingestion of watercress
  inhibits the hydroxylation of chlorzoxazone, an in vivo probe for CYP2E1, in healthy
  volunteers. It has also been shown that watercress is a bifunctional agent with
  the ability to induce both phase I  and II enzymes. Adding watercress juice to human
  liver cells induced the activity of CYP4501A and ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase and
  NADH-quinone reductase. According to reports, PEITC also has several anticarcinogenic
  effects given that it can inhibit phase I enzymes and/or activate phase II enzymes.
  Watercress juice can increase the enzymes SOD and GPX in blood cells in vitro and
  in vivo. Isothiocyanates also interact with ABC efflux transporters such as Ppg,
  MRP1, MRP2, and BCRP and may influence the pharmacokinetics of substrates of these
  transporters. According to current data, watercress and isothiocyanate may have
  clinical repercussions by inducing changes in the bioavailability of some drugs.\n\nSpinach
  \ is an important antioxidant vegetable usually consumed after boiling the fresh
  or frozen leaves. Freshly cut spinach leaves contain approximately 1000 mg of total
  flavonoids per kilogram, and the occurrence of at least 10 flavonoid glycosides
  has been reported. These are glucuronides and acylated di-and triglycosides of methylated
  and methylene dioxide derivatives of 6-oxygenated flavonols. While epidemiological
  and preclinical data support the nutritional benefits of spinach and the safety
  of its consumption, there are no publications about its effects on drug-metabolizing
  enzymes and drug transporters. Little is currently known about the in vivo effects
  these compounds have on the bioavailability of xenobiotics the clearance and/or
  tissue distribution of which is determined by active transport and biotransformation.
  Platt and others  reported the protective effect of spinach against the genotoxic
  effects of 2-amino-3-methylimidazoquinoline  by interaction with CYP1A2 as a mechanism
  of antigenotoxicity. Its high isothiocyanate and flavonoid content demands additional
  research to evaluate possible nutrient-drug interactions.\n\nTomatoes  and tomato-based
  products are a source of important nutrients and contain numerous phytochemicals,
  such as carotenoids, that may influence health. Tomatoes are also a source of a
  vast array of flavonols, phytosterols, and phenylpropanoids. Lycopene is the most
  important carotenoid present in tomatoes and tomato products, and their dietary
  intake has been linked to a decreased risk of chronic illnesses such as cancer and
  cardiovascular disease. Studies performed on human recombinant CYP1 showed that
  lycopene inhibits CYP1A1 and CYP1B1. Lycopene has also been shown to slightly reduce
  the induction of ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase activity by 20% by dimethylbenzanthracene
  in MCF-7 cells. It appears to inhibit bioactivation enzymes and induce detoxifying
  enzymes. It has been suggested that lycopene might have a potential advantage over
  other phytochemicals by facilitating the elimination of genotoxic chemicals and
  their metabolites. Recent in vitro evidence suggests that high-dose lycopene supplementation
  increases hepatic cytochrome P4502E1 protein and inflammation in alcohol-fed rats.\n\nCarrots
  \ are widely consumed as food. The active components of carrots, which include beta-carotene
  and panaxynol, have been studied by many researchers. Carrots induce PST activity
  \ and decrease CYP1A2 activity. Bradfield and others have reported that a carrot
  diet increased the activity of ethoxycoumarin O-deethylase  activity in a mouse
  model.\n\nAvocado  is a good source of bioactive compounds such as monounsaturated
  fatty acids and sterols. Growing evidence on the health benefits of avocadoes has
  led to increased consumption and research on potential health benefits. Phytochemicals
  extracted from avocado can selectively induce several biological functions. Two
  articles published in the 1990s reported avocados interact with warfarin, stating
  that the fruit inhibited the effect of warfarin. They, however, did not establish
  the cause of such inhibition.\n\nYeh and Yen have reported that asparagus, cauliflower,
  celery, and eggplant induced significant PST-P activity, whereas asparagus, eggplant,
  and potato induced PST-M activity. Harris and Jeffery  have also reported that a
  diet supplemented with apiaceous vegetables  resulted in a 13% to 15% decrease in
  CYP1A2 activity. The authors speculate that furanocumarins present in the apiaceous
  vegetables were responsible for the inhibitory effects on CYP1A2.\n\nVegetables,
  such as cabbage, celery, onion, and parsley, are known to have a high content of
  polyphenols. It has been reported that polyphenols can potentially affect phase
  I metabolism either by direct inhibition of phase I enzymes or by regulating the
  expression of enzyme levels via their interactions with regulatory cascades. Several
  studies have directly and indirectly shown that dietary polyphenols can modulate
  phase II metabolism. In addition, polyphenols have been shown to interact with ABC
  drug transporters involved in drug resistance and drug absorption, distribution,
  and excretion.\n\nWHO and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations
  \ recommend a daily intake of at least 400 g or 5 servings of fruits and vegetables
  to aid in the prevention of chronic illnesses such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes,
  and obesity. As a consequence, there is an increased global consumer demand for
  fruits and vegetables, and some consumers purchase organic foods with the understanding
  that they are healthy. The use of natural products for improving human health has
  evolved independently in different regions of the world and production, use, attitudes,
  and regulatory aspects vary globally. Although modern medicine may be available
  in most countries for the treatment of many chronic degenerative diseases, folk
  medicine  has remained popular for historical and cultural reasons. Although the
  significance of interactions between drugs is widely appreciated, little attention
  has been given to interactions between drugs and nutrients. Most of the documented
  information about the effects of fruit and vegetables on metabolizing enzymes and
  drug transporters comes from preclinical studies. However, the possibility that
  these effects could occur in humans should not be ignored. Several clinical studies
  on the interactions of grapefruit juice and drugs have been conducted with impressive
  results. Most of the fruits and vegetables examined in this review contain a similar
  phytochemical mix to that of grapefruit juice. In vitro models and animal models
  have shown that many of these agents influence drug-metabolizing enzymes and drug
  transporters. It is possible that other fruits and vegetables could have the same
  potential for fruit and drug interactions, and this should be taken into account.
  This review shows evidence of the influence of fruit, vegetables, or their components
  \ on the CYP3A4 enzyme, which metabolizes most drugs used by the human population.
  A more consistent approach to the evaluation of nutrient-drug interactions in human
  beings is therefore needed. Said approach must be systematic in order to  assess
  the influence of nutritional status, foodstuffs, or specific nutrients on a drugs
  pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, and  evaluate the influence of a drug on
  overall nutritional status or the status of a specific nutrient. In addition to
  all this, we must account for the fact that we live in an era of very varied lifestyles.
  Some people are vegetarians, others take high doses of flavonoids or antioxidants
  as supplements, some ingest large amounts of bottled water from plastic bottles,
  or use chlorinated disinfectants. In industrialized countries, fruits and vegetables
  tend have been subjected to some sort of processing  that might have an effect on
  the bioactive compound. All of these factors could have an impact on the metabolism
  or transport of drugs in a individual, potentially altering pharmacological responses.
  Our knowledge regarding the potential risk of nutrient-drug interactions is still
  limited. Therefore, efforts to elucidate potential risk of food-drug interactions
  should be intensified in order to prevent undesired and harmful clinical consequences.\n"
