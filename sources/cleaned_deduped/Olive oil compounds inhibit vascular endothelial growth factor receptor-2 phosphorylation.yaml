  oil compounds inhibit vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 phosphorylation.md
text: '


  Vascular endothelial growth factor  triggers crucial signaling processes that regulate
  tumor angiogenesis and, therefore, represents an attractive target for the development
  of novel anticancer therapeutics. Several epidemiological studies have confirmed
  that abundant consumption of foods from plant origin is associated with reduced
  risk of developing cancers. In the Mediterranean basin, the consumption of extra
  virgin olive oil is an important constituent of the diet. Compared to other vegetable
  oils, the presence of several phenolic antioxidants in olive oil is believed to
  prevent the occurrence of a variety of pathological processes, such as cancer. While
  the strong antioxidant potential of these molecules is well characterized, their
  antiangiogenic activities remain unknown. The aim of this study is to investigate
  whether tyrosol, hydroxytyrosol, taxifolin, oleuropein  and oleic acid, five compounds
  contained in extra virgin olive oil, can affect in vitro angiogenesis. We found
  that HT, Tax and OA were the most potent angiogenesis inhibitors through their inhibitory
  effect on specific autophosphorylation sites of VEGFR-2  leading to the inhibition
  of endothelial cell  signaling. Inhibition of VEGFR-2 by these olive oil compounds
  significantly reduced VEGF-induced EC proliferation and migration as well as their
  morphogenic differentiation into capillary-like tubular structures in Matrigel.
  Our study demonstrates that HT, Tax and OA are novel and potent inhibitors of the
  VEGFR-2 signaling pathway. These findings emphasize the chemopreventive properties
  of olive oil and highlight the importance of nutrition in cancer prevention.'
