  of selenium compounds on proliferation and epigenetic marks of breast cancer cells.md
text: '


  Breast cancer is a global public health problem and the most frequent cause of cancer
  death among women. Mammary carcinogenesis is driven not only by genetic alterations
  but also by epigenetic disturbances. Because epigenetic marks are potentially reversible
  they represent promising molecular targets for breast cancer prevention interventions.
  Selenium is a promising anti-breast cancer trace element that has shown the modulation
  of DNA methylation and histone post-translational modifications in other malignancies.
  This study aimed to evaluate the effects of selenium compounds  on cell proliferation
  and death, expression of the tumor suppressor gene RASSF1A and epigenetic marks
  in MCF-7 human breast adenocarcinoma cells. Treatment with MSA or selenite markedly
  inhibited  in a dose-dependent manner the proliferation of MCF-7 cells. MSA induced  G2/M
  cell arrest while selenite presented the opposite effect. Regarding cell death induction,
  MSA acted mainly by inducing apoptosis, while selenite only induced necrosis. Furthermore
  selenite, but not MSA, markedly induced  cytotoxicity and increased  RASSF1A expression.
  Both selenium compounds inhibited  DNMT1 expression. MSA decreased  H3K9me3 and
  increased  H4K16ac, while selenite decreased  this latter histone mark. To the best
  of our knowledge this is the first report showing that selenite and MSA modulate
  epigenetic marks specifically in breast cancer cells. Our data reinforce the anti-breast
  cancer potential of selenium that is dependent on its chemical form. Furthermore
  the data show that epigenetic mechanisms represent relevant molecular targets involved
  in selenium inhibitory effects in breast cancer cells.'
