  role of polycomb group protein Bmi-1 and Notch4 in breast cancer stem cell inhibition
  by benzyl isothiocyanate.md
text: '


  We showed previously that garden cress constituent benzyl isothiocyanate  inhibits
  self-renewal of breast cancer stem cells  in vitro and in vivo. The present study
  offers novel insights into the mechanism by which BITC inhibits bCSC. Flow cytometry
  and mammosphere assay were performed to quantify bCSC fraction. Protein expression
  was determined by western blotting. Apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry using
  Annexin V-propidium iodide method. Cell migration was determined by Boyden chamber
  assay. BITC treatment resulted in a marked decrease in protein level of polycomb
  group protein B-lymphoma Moloney murine leukemia virus insertion region-1  in cultured
  human breast cancer cells  and MDA-MB-231 xenografts in vivo. Overexpression  or
  knockdown  of Bmi-1 protein had no meaningful impact on the BITCs ability to inhibit
  cell viability and cell migration and/or induce apoptosis. On the other hand, inhibition
  of bCSC markers  resulting from BITC exposure was significantly altered by Bmi-1
  overexpression and knockdown. BITC was previously shown to cause activation of Notch1,
  Notch2, and Notch4 in association with induction of -secretase complex component
  Nicastrin, which are also implicated in maintenance of cancer stemness. BITC-mediated
  inhibition of bCSC was augmented by knockdown of Notch4 and Nicastrin, but not by
  RNA interference of Notch1 or Notch2. The present study highlights important roles
  for Bmi-1 and Notch4 in BITC-mediated suppression of bCSC.


  Search for non-toxic interventions to delay onset and/or progression of breast cancer
  continues mainly because most of the risk factors associated with this neoplasm
  are not easily modifiable and the currently available clinical options  target only
  a subset of the disease. Despite a comprehensive understanding of the genomic landscape
  and the biology of the breast cancer  this malignancy still accounts for &gt;40,000
  deaths each year in the United States alone. An emerging paradigm suggests that
  elimination of tumor-initiating cells  as well as the transformed cells constituting
  bulk of the tumor mass may be necessary for successful prevention and treatment
  of breast cancer. The bCSC are implicated in initiation, maintenance, and metastatic
  spread of breast cancers.


  Phytochemicals present in our daily diet as well as in certain medicinal plants
  are attractive for cancer prevention. Benzyl isothiocyanate, an electrophilic compound
  in edible cruciferous vegetables, is one such phytochemical with compelling preclinical
  evidence for its efficacy against breast cancer. Higher intake of broccoli, a member
  of the cruciferous vegetable family, is suggested to decrease the risk of breast
  cancer in premenopausal women. BITC administration was associated with inhibition
  of chemically induced breast cancer in experimental animals. BITC has the ability
  to retard in vivo growth of mammary tumor xenografts in mice. For example, the primary
  tumor growth and pulmonary metastasis of 4T1 mammary carcinoma cells implanted into
  the mammary fat pads of female syngeneic BALB/c mice was significantly retarded
  by oral administration of 5 and 10 mg BITC/kg body weight/day for 32 days. Moreover,
  the inhibitory effect was relatively more pronounced on lung metastasis than on
  primary tumors. Work from our own laboratory has established mammary cancer chemopreventive
  efficacy of BITC  in mouse mammary tumor virus-neu transgenic mice. More recent
  work from our laboratory has demonstrated in vitro and in vivo suppression of bCSC
  fraction upon treatment with BITC. However, the molecular mechanism underlying BITC-mediated
  inhibition of bCSC is still not fully understood.


  The present study was designed to determine the role of B-lymphoma Moloney murine
  leukemia virus insertion region-1  and the Notch receptors, which have emerged as
  regulators of bCSC self-renewal and maintenance, in bCSC inhibition by BITC. For
  instance, the Notch4 activity was shown to be eight-fold higher in bCSC-enriched
  populations compared with differentiated breast cancer cells. A role for Notch1
  in expansion of bCSC was also suggested very recently. The effect of BITC on Bmi-1
  expression is not known, but this compound was previously shown to cause activation
  of Notch1, Notch2, and Notch4 in a panel of human breast cancer cells.


  Fresh-frozen MDA-MB-231 tumor xenograft specimens from control and BITC-treated
  mice from our previous study  were used to determine the in vivo effect of BITC
  administration on expression of Bmi-1 protein. Use of mice and their care was in
  accordance with the University of Pittsburgh Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
  guidelines.


  BITC  was purchased from LKT laboratories  and dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide.
  Regents for cell culture were from Invitrogen-Life Technologies. Antibodies against
  Bmi-1, cleaved Notch1, and Nicastrin were from Cell Signaling Technology ; anti--actin
  and anti-Notch4 antibodies were from Sigma-Aldrich ; and anti-cleaved Notch 2 antibody
  was from EMD Millipore. Small interfering RNA  targeted against Bmi-1, Notch1, Notch2,
  Notch4, and Nicastrin, were acquired from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, whereas a nonspecific
  control siRNA was purchased from Qiagen. Annexin V-FITC apoptosis detection kit
  was purchased from BD Biosciences. The Bmi-1-targeted small hairpin RNA  and control
  shRNA were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, and MDA-MB-361
  cells were purchased from the American Type Culture collection. SUM159 cell line
  was purchased from Asterand. MCF-7 cells were stably transfected with empty pcDNA3.1
  vector or the same vector encoding for Bmi-1 using FuGENE6. The pcDNA3.1-Bmi-1 plasmid
  was a generous gift form Dr. M. H. Yang. Cells stably overexpressing Bmi-1 were
  generated by 8-week culture in medium containing 1 mg/mL of G418. SUM159 cells were
  stably transfected with 2 g of control shRNA or Bmi-1-targeted shRNA using transfection
  medium and reagents from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. SUM159 clone with stable knockdown
  of Bmi-1 was selected with 1.5 g/mL of Puromycin over a 4-week period.


  Preparation of cell lysates and xenograft supernatants and the details of western
  blotting have been described by us previously.


  The effect of BITC on cell viability was ascertained after 72 h treatment by MTS
  method using reagents from Promega  according to the suppliers instructions or trypan
  blue dye exclusion assay as described previously.


  Apoptotic fraction was quantified by flow cytometry after staining with Annexin
  V/propidium iodide as described by us previously.


  Cell migration was determined as described by us previously  using Transwell Boyden
  chambers from Corning  containing 8-m polycarbonate filter.


  The ALDH1 activity was determined using ALDEFLUORTM assay kit from STEMCELL Technologies.
  Suppliers protocol was followed for ALDH1 activity assay.


  Mammosphere formation assay was performed as described by us previously  with the
  exception that the culture medium was supplemented with 0.9 % methylcellulose to
  reduce cell aggregation. Briefly, one thousand cells were plated in ultralow attachment
  plates from Corning in medium containing penicillin/streptomycin, B27, insulin,
  hydrocortisone, epidermal growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor, 2-mercaptoethanol,
  and methylcellulose. Desired concentrations of BITC or DMSO  were then added to
  the plates. After a 5-day  or 7-day  incubation, the mammospheres were scored under
  an inverted microscope.


  Cells were transfected at 5060 % confluence with control  or desired siRNA  for
  24 h. The cells were then treated with DMSO or BITC and used for various assays.


  For each experiment, statistical comparisons were performed to answer two specific
  questions:  whether overexpression or knockdown of a desired protein itself affected
  cellular phenotype, and  if BITC-mediated inhibition of a given phenotype was affected
  by overexpression or knockdown of the desired protein. Statistically significant
  differences addressing only these questions are shown in figures.


  We used a panel of human breast cancer cells  representing major subtypes and pharmacologically
  relevant BITC concentrations  to study its effect treatment on Bmi-1 protein level.
  The western blots shown in Fig. 1a revealed downregulation of Bmi-1 protein level
  after treatment with BITC in each cell line, although cell line-specific differences
  were also discernible. For example, BITC-mediated suppression of Bmi-1 protein level
  was clearly evident at all three time points and at both drug concentrations in
  MCF-7 cells. In contrast, downregulation of Bmi-1 protein expression post-BITC treatment
  was observed only at 48 h  and 72 h-time points  in MDA-MB-231 cells.

  with respective DMSO-treated control, and #between empty vector-transfected and
  Bmi-1-overexpressing MCF-7 cells by one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferronis multiple
  comparison test. Each experiment was repeated twice, and representative data from
  one such experiment are shown


  Consistent with cellular results, inhibition of MDA-MB-231 xenograft growth in vivo
  after BITC administration  was accompanied by a decrease in Bmi-1 protein level.
  Bmi-1 expression was visually obvious in 4 of 5 MDA-MB-231 xenografts from the control
  group. The reason for variability in Bmi-1 protein level in control xenografts is
  unclear, but its expression was barely detectable in each MDA-MB-231 xenograft from
  the BITC treatment group. Collectively, these results indicated that the BITC-mediated
  downregulation of Bmi-1 protein was neither cell line-specific nor restricted to
  cultured breast cancer cells.


  In agreement with published data, overexpression of Bmi-1 protein  led to a significant  increase
  in MCF-7 cell viability. In addition, Bmi-1-overexpressing MCF-7 cells exhibited
  a modest but statistically significant resistance to cell viability inhibition by
  BITC. In sharp contrast to MCF-7 cells, viability of SUM159 cells was not affected
  by stable knockdown of Bmi-1 protein. Furthermore, SUM159 cells stably transfected
  with the control shRNA and the Bmi-1-targeted shRNA were equally sensitive to BITC-mediated
  inhibition of cell viability. Consistent with these results, cell viability inhibition
  by BITC was not affected by knockdown of Bmi-1 protein  by transient transfection
  with siRNA in either SUM159 or MDA-MB-231 cells. Similarly, cell viability inhibition
  by BITC, determined by trypan blue dye exclusion assay, was not affected by RNA
  interference of Bmi-1 at least in SUM159 cells. These results indicated cell line-specific
  role for Bmi-1 in regulation of cell viability.


  Breast cancer growth retardation upon treatment with BITC is accompanied by apoptosis
  induction in vitro and in vivo. Even though the published literature on the role
  of Bmi-1 in regulation of apoptosis is ambiguous, we were tempted to test if the
  proapoptotic response to BITC was affected by overexpression or knockdown of Bmi-1
  protein. Figure 2a shows early  and late apoptotic fraction  in MCF-7 and SUM159
  cells after 24 h treatment with DMSO or BITC. The basal apoptosis was not affected
  by stable overexpression  or stable knockdown  of the Bmi-1 protein. With the exception
  of a modest attenuation of cell death induction at the higher BITC dose in MCF-7
  cells, the proapoptotic effect of this agent was generally not affected by alteration
  of Bmi-1 expression. Our interpretation of these results is that Bmi-1 is largely
  dispensable for apoptosis induction by BITC.

  Overexpression of Bmi-1 protein in immortalized human mammary epithelial cells was
  previously shown to increase cell migration, whereas a decrease in propensity for
  migration of MDA-MB-435S cancerous breast cells was discernible after its knockdown.
  Even though stable knockdown of Bmi-1 protein resulted in a modest decrease in SUM159
  cell migration, the difference was insignificant. Nevertheless, the extent of cell
  migration inhibition by BITC was comparable in sh-control and sh-Bmi-1 cells.


  Because of incomplete knockdown of the protein using Bmi-1-targeted shRNA, we carried
  out experiments using a Bmi-1-targeted siRNA. BITC-mediated inhibition of MDA-MB-231  and
  SUM159  cell migration was not affected even after 90 % knockdown of Bmi-1 protein
  with transient RNA interference. Similar results were observed in cells transfected
  with control and Bmi-1 siRNA even at lower  BITC concentration. These results indicated
  that Bmi-1 knockdown did not affect cell migration inhibition by BITC.

  Two independent assays, including ALDH1 activity determination and mammosphere formation,
  were performed to explore potential involvement of Bmi-1 in BITC-mediated suppression
  of bCSC activity. Figure 4a shows flow histograms for ALDH1 activity with or without
  treatment with BITC or ALDH1 inhibitor diethylaminobenzaldehyde. The ALDH1 activity
  was increased by about 2.3-fold upon overexpression of Bmi-1 itself in MCF-7 cells.
  Treatment of empty vector-transfected MCF-7 cells with 1 M BITC for 72 h led to
  a 37 % decrease in ALDH1 activity compared with DMSO control, but the difference
  was not significant. A decrease of only about 10 %  in ALDH1 activity was observed
  by a similar treatment in MCF-7 cell stably overexpressing Bmi-1 in comparison with
  DMSO control. The difference in ALDH1 activity between BITC-treated empty vector
  and BITC-treated Bmi-1-overexpressing cells was significant. The ALDH1 activity
  was decreased by about 56 % after knockdown of Bmi-1 protein  in SUM159 cells. BITC
  treatment resulted in a 38 % decrease in ALDH1 activity in SUM159 cells stably transfected
  with control shRNA. In addition, the BITC-mediated inhibition of ALDH1 activity
  was augmented by Bmi-1 knockdown in SUM159 cells. Similar results were seen in MDA-MB-231
  cells transiently transfected with Bmi-1-targeted siRNA.

  with BITC or DMSO. Quantitation of mammospheres revealed 1.9-fold enrichment in
  MCF-7 cells after Bmi-1 overexpression. Mammosphere number was decreased by 47 %  after
  BITC treatment in empty vector-transfected MCF-7 cells. Overexpression of Bmi-1
  in MCF-7 cells conferred significant protection against mammosphere inhibition by
  BITC. Mammosphere frequency was reduced by 42 %  in Bmi-1 knockdown SUM159 cells.
  BITC-mediated inhibition of mammosphere number was augmented after stable knockdown
  of Bmi-1 in SUM159 cells. The general conclusions from the mammosphere formation
  assays were consistent with those of ALDH1 activity data.

  The transcription factors belonging to the Notch family, especially Notch1 and Notch4
  have emerged as critical mediators of stemness in breast cancer. At the same time,
  a tumor suppressor role for Notch2 has also been suggested in breast cancer cells.
  Our own previous work has revealed that BITC treatment increases levels of cleaved
  Notch1, Notch2, and Notch4 leading to transcriptional activation of Notch in a panel
  of human breast cancer cells, including MCF-7 and SUM159 cell lines. Furthermore,
  the BITC-mediated activation of Notch was accompanied by induction of -secretase
  complex component Nicastrin. Therefore, it was of interest to test whether anti-bCSC
  effect of BITC was compromised due to Notch activation. A series of RNA interference
  studies were conducted using MCF-7 cells to explore this possibility. RNA interference
  of Notch2  decreased ALDH1 activity, but BITC elicited more or less similar response
  in cells transfected with control siRNA and Notch1 or Notch2 siRNA. RNA interference
  of Notch4 resulted in 6090 % decrease in its protein level in MCF-7 and SUM159 cells.
  In MCF-7 cells, the ALDH1 activity was statistically significantly inhibited by
  BITC treatment  as well as by Notch4 knockdown alone. The overall pattern was the
  same in SUM159 cells, but the difference did not reach significance for Notch4 knockdown
  alone compared with cells transfected with control siRNA. In both cells, however,
  BITC-mediated inhibition of ALDH1 activity was statistically significantly augmented
  by Notch4 knockdown. We next explored whether activation of Notch4 was affected
  by Bmi-1 status. As can be seen in Fig. 7d, Notch4 activation was marginally affected
  by overexpression  and knockdown of Bmi-1.

  experiments are shown


  Transient knockdown of Nicastrin protein  resulted in potentiation of ALDH1 activity
  inhibition by BITC in MCF-7 cells. Consistent with the published literature, Nicastrin
  knockdown alone was inhibitory against MCF-7 stemness. These results indicated that  Notch1
  and Notch2 are largely dispensable for bCSC inhibition by BITC, and  Notch4 activation
  by BITC, likely due to induction of Nicastrin, impeded its inhibitory effect on
  ALDH1 activity.

  The role of the polycomb group protein Bmi-1 in regulation of cell viability or
  apoptosis is not fully understood. One study showed a decrease in cell viability
  in MCF-7 cells after knockdown of the Bmi-1 protein. The present study reveals that
  while Bmi-1 expression affects MCF-7 cell viability, this relationship is not obvious
  in SUM159 or MDA-MB-231 cells. Thus, the association of Bmi-1 expression level with
  cell viability seems unique to MCF-7 cells. This scenario is partially supported
  by the literature data showing no effect of Bmi-1 knockdown on viability of MDA-MB-435S
  cells. Nevertheless, the present study reveals that the Bmi-1 expression has marginal
  impact on BITCs ability to inhibit viability or induce apoptotic cell death in cells
  other than MCF-7. We also found no meaningful impact of Bmi-1 knockdown on SUM159
  cell migration.


  The present study shows that overexpression of Bmi-1 confers protection against
  bCSC inhibition by BITC in MCF-7 cells. In agreement with these results, bCSC inhibition
  by BITC is augmented by Bmi-1 knockdown in SUM159 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Bmi-1 can
  cause mammary epithelial cells to evade senescence leading to immortalization. High
  Bmi-1 expression in human breast cancer specimens correlates with clinical and pathologic
  classification. Immunohistochemical analysis of Bmi-1 in breast tumors suggests
  that its expression is an independent prognostic factor associated with basal-like
  phenotype and poor survival. Even though examples also exist arguing against the
  association of high Bmi-1 expression with unfavorable prognosis in breast cancer,
  the results shown herein indicate, for the first time, that Bmi-1 is a novel target
  of bCSC inhibition by BITC. We also propose that Bmi-1 suppression may represent
  a viable pharmacodynamic biomarker of BITC exposure because the expression of Bmi-1
  is decreased after BITC treatment both in vitro and in vivo.


  The present study building upon our previous findings  highlights that the activation
  of Notch4 by BITC attenuates its inhibitory effect on bCSC activity. Knockdown of
  -secretase complex component Nicastrin also augments bCSC inhibition by BITC. However,
  a similar relationship is not observed for Notch1 and Notch2 despite their activation
  by BITC. The mechanism by which Notch4 regulates bCSC activity is not fully understood,
  but interaction with peptidyl-prolyl isomerase Pin1 leading to escape from proteasomal
  degradation has been observed in human breast cancer cells. We are tempted to speculate
  that mammary cancer prevention by BITC is likely augmented by a combination regimen
  involving Notch4 inhibitor, but validation of this hypothesis requires investigation.


  In summary, data shown herein indicate that  BITC decreases expression of Bmi-1
  protein in vitro;  expression of Bmi-1 protein is decreased in vivo after BITC administration
  to MDA-MB-231 xenograft bearing athymic mice;  Bmi-1 is largely dispensable for
  BITC-mediated inhibition of cell viability and migration;  BITCs ability to induce
  apoptosis in human breast cancer cells is not altered by Bmi-1 expression level;  Bmi-1
  plays an important role in bCSC inhibition by BITC; and  Notch4 activation by BITC
  hinders its inhibitory effect on bCSC.
