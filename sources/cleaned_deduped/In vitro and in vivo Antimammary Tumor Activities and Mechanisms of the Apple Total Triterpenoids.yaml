  chronic diseases, including tumors and cardiovascular diseases. The apple total
  triterpenoid content was extracted and concentrated from apple peels. The in vitro
  and in vivo antitumor activities, related antitumor mechanisms, were investigated.
  In vitro, ATT showed potent antiproliferative activities against human breast cancer,
  human colon cancer, and human liver cancer cell lines. In vivo antitumor experiments
  showed that ATT could substantially reduce the occurrence and growth of mammary
  tumor with a good dose-dependent manner in a rat model. During the apoptosis in
  MDA-MB-231 cells induced by ATT, the caspase-independent pathway was involved in
  the process of apoptosis, and the mitochondrial transmembrane potential was markedly
  reduced. Also the PI3K/Akt/NF-κB pathway was activated. These results indicated
  that ATT-induced apoptosis of MDA-MB-231 cells may involve a mitochondrial-related
  pathway.\n\n\n\napple; total triterpenoids; mammary tumor; antitumor activities;
  antitumor mechanisms; MDA-MB-231 cells\n\n\n\nApples play a very significant part
  in the diet of humans. Consumption of apples has been linked to the prevention of
  various chronic diseases.(1) Apple intake can reduce mammary tumor incidence and
  growth,(2) lung cancer incidence,(3, 4)cardiovascular disease,(5) symptoms of chronic
  obstructive pulmonary disease,(6) and the risk of thrombotic stroke.(7) Meanwhile,
  apple extracts have been shown to have potent antioxidant and antiproliferative
  activity against human tumor cells.(8) Apple peels exhibited lipase-inhibitory activity,
  which may be linked to the ursenoic acid content. Furthermore, both triterpenoid
  content and lipase-inhibitory activity varied by cultivar.(9)\n\nIn our previous
  study, the bioactive compounds of apple peels were investigated, and it was found
  that the triterpenoids may be responsible for apple’s anticancer activity.(10, 11)
  There were 22 triterpenoids isolated and identified from the peels of red delicious
  apple. Ursanes and oleananes were the two classes of triterpenoids found in apple.
  Ursolic acid was the main and active constituent among the total triterpenoids.(10)\n\nApoptosis
  is a form of programmed cell death involving a biochemical cascade. It is also necessary
  for the destruction of cells considered a threat such as cells infected with viruses,
  cells with DNA damage, and cancerous cells. Impaired regulation of apoptosis leads
  to a variety of diseases. The progress of apoptosis is regulated by a series of
  signal cascades under certain circumstances: internal and external signals. Internal
  damage to a cell, such as oxidative damage, causes Bcl-2 to activate Bax, which
  creates holes in the mitochondrial membrane. These holes allow the entry of cytochrome
  c into the cytoplasm. Cytochrome c binds to Apaf-1 forming complexes that aggregate
  to form apoptosomes. The apoptosomes activate caspases. These executioner caspases
  activate a cascade of proteolytic activity that leads to the digestion of structural
  proteins, DNA degradation. For external signals, FasL and TNF-alpha/beta can bind
  to the cell membrane receptors Fas and TNF, respectively. Binding of the Fas or
  TNF ligands results in the activation of caspase-8, which unleashes a proteolytic
  cascade similar to that activated by caspase-9. Fas ligand has been well characterized
  as a death factor. The death domain of Fas, FADD, and caspase-8 were required for
  NF-κB activation by FasL.(12) FasL is a critical downstream effector of p53-dependent
  apoptosis.(13, 14) This cascade results in phagocytosis of the cell. However, recent
  evidence for FasL-independent activation of Fas suggests that the death receptor
  can also be activated intracellularly, in the absence of its ligand.(15) The caspase-cascade
  system plays vital roles in the induction, transduction and amplification of intracellular
  apoptotic signals.(16, 17)\n\nSIRT1 is an NAD+-dependent protein deacetylase with
  over two dozen known substrates that affect a wide variety of cellular processes,
  including metabolism, cell cycle, growth and differentiation, inflammation, senescence,
  apoptosis, stress response, and aging.(18) PI3K/Akt constitutes an important pathway
  regulating the signaling of multiple biological processes such as apoptosis, metabolism,
  cell proliferation, and cell growth.(19, 20)\n\nThe family of NF-κB transcription
  factors play a key role in diverse biological processes, such as cell survival and
  tumor development. Members of the NF-κB family of dimeric transcription factors
  regulate expression of a large number of genes involved in immune responses, inflammation,
  cell survival, and cancer.(21)\n\nIn the present work, the total triterpenoids of
  apple were extracted and concentrated from apple peels and its antitumor activities
  were investigated in vitro and in vivo. The related mechanisms of ATT-induced MDA-MB-231
  cell apoptosis were investigated through caspase-independent mitochondria pathway
  and PI3K/Akt/NF-κB pathway.\n\n\n\n\nApples of red Fuji variety were purchased from
  Wuhan Shahu Fruits Market. They were harvested in October 2009.\n\n\nAll analytical
  and HPLC grade reagents were purchased from Mallinckrodt Chemicals. 7,12-Dimethylbenzanthracene
  was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co.. D101 macroporus resin was product
  of Xi’an Lanxiao Resin Corporation Ltd..\n\nFetal bovine serum and cell culture
  medium were purchased from Gibco Life Technologies. Ac-YVAD-CMK, Z-IETD-FMK, and
  Z-LEHD-FMK were purchased from ICN. Z-DEVD-FMK and Z-VAD-FMK were purchased from
  Calbiochem. Akt inhibitor, staurosporine, wortmannin, PDTC, MG132, H-7, Hoechst
  33258, propidium iodide, RNase A, proteinase K, and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5
  -diphenyltetrazolium bromide were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co..\n\nExtraction
  and Concentration of the Total Apple Triterpenoids from Apple Peels\n\nFresh apples
  of red Fuji variety were peeled by an apple peeler. The fresh apple peels were dried
  under 60 °C and then crushed into small pieces, which were extracted twice using
  10 volumes of 95% ethanol for 2 h at reflux. The 95% ethanol extract was evaporated
  under vacuum at 45 °C to remove ethanol. The residue was then resuspended in 1000
  mL of water and subjected to a D101 macroporus resin column. The resin column was
  eluted with 3000 mL of 60% ethanol and then with 3000 mL of 95% ethanol, respectively.
  The 95% ethanol elution was concentrated in vacuum, yielding a white powder.\n\n\nThe
  total triterpenoid content in ATT was determined by colorimetric methods using the
  reported protocol.(22) Briefly, UA standards were prepared fresh in methanol before
  use. 1 mL of sample or UA standard solution was added into each test tube and then
  taken to dryness under nitrogen gas. To each tube was added 0.3 mL of 5% vanillin–glacial
  acetic acid solution and 1.0 mL of perchloric acid, which was reacted in a 60 °C
  water bath for 20 min. Then, 5 mL of glacial acetic acid was added and mixed well.
  The absorbance was measured at 550 nm using a Microplate Reader. Total triterpenoid
  content was expressed as mg of UA equivalent per gram of sample. Data were reported
  as mean ± SD for at least three replicates.\n\nUrsolic acid and oleanolic acid were
  determined by HPLC using a Waters 600 instrument equipped with a PDA detector. The
  chromatographic conditions were as follows: column, LiChrospher 100 RP-100e 5 μm;
  detection wavelength, 210 nm; mobile phase, CH3CN–H2O–CF3COOH; flow rate, 0.8 mL/min;
  column temperature, 40 °C.\n\n\nHuman breast cancer, human colon cancer, and human
  liver cancer cell lines were purchased from American Type Culture Collection. They
  were used for bioactivity evaluation of ATT, UA, and OA based on the established
  protocols.(10) Briefly, cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagles medium
  supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 mM HEPES, 50 units/mL penicillin, 50
  μg/mL streptomycin, and 100 μg/mL gentamicin and were maintained at 37 °C in 5%
  CO2. A total of 2.5 × 104 cells in growth medium were placed in each well of a 96-well
  flat-bottom plate. After 12 h of incubation, the growth medium was replaced by medium
  containing different concentrations of the test samples. After 48 h of incubation,
  cell proliferation was determined by colorimetric MTT assay. Cell proliferation
  was determined at 48 h from the MTT absorbance reading for each concentration compared
  to the control. At least three replications for each sample were used to determine
  the cell proliferation.\n\n\nAll protocols involving animal experiments were approved
  by the ethics committee of Wuhan University, China. The DMBA was dissolved in olive
  oil at a concentration of 25 mg/mL. Female Sprague–Dawley rats at the age of 50
  days weighing 160–180 g were gavaged with 60 mg of DMBA/kg body weight, a dose sufficient
  to cause 100% tumor incidence over the course of study.(23)\n\nAfter 12 weeks of
  DMBA administration, the mammary carcinomas of rats were confirmed by histological
  examination and breast palpation for continuing experiments. The tumor bearing rats
  were divided initially into five groups, namely, control group, ATT groups, and
  cisplatin group. Each group had 10 rats. ATT was dissolved in glycerin. Cisplatin
  was dissolved in normal saline for injection at 2.0 mg/mL. The control group received
  normal saline. The ATT groups were gavaged with ATT at 25, 50, and 100 mg/kg, respectively.
  The cisplatin group was treated with 10 mg/kg cisplatin by intraperitoneal injection.
  The rats of all groups were treated with the corresponding samples for 2 weeks.\n\nThe
  body weights were measured before the rats were sacrificed at the 20th day. The
  total weight of all observable tumors in each rat was calculated for analysis.\n\n\nMDA-MB-231
  cells were treated with ATT in culture medium as described above for different time
  intervals. The cells were then harvested, washed with cold phosphate buffered saline,
  and processed for cell cycle analysis.(24) Briefly, the cells were centrifuged,
  washed in PBS, and fixed in cold 70% ethanol for at least 24 h, and then they were
  stained with a PI solution. The sample was read on a Coulter Epics XL flow cytometer.\n\n\nExternalization
  of phosphatidylserine on the plasma membrane of apoptotic cells was detected using
  Annexin V-FITC.(25) Briefly, cells were collected by trypsinization and allowed
  to recover for 30 min in growth medium. Cells were washed twice with cold PBS and
  then resuspended in 1 time binding buffer at a cell density of 1 × 106 cells/mL.
  100 μL of the solution was transferred to a 5 mL culture tube, and 5 μL of Annexin
  V-FITC and 5 μL of PI were added. The cells were gently vortexed and incubated for
  15 min at rt in the dark. 400 μL of 1× binding buffer was added to each tube. The
  cells were analyzed by flow cytometry within one hour.\n\n\nTo measure the mitochondrial
  transmembrane potential, the MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with 5 mg·L–1 ATT at
  the indicated time, washed with PBS, and then incubated with PBS containing 1 μg/mL
  rhodamine 123 at room temperature for 30 min. After two washes and final resuspension
  in PBS, the fluorescence of cells was measured by flow cytometry.(26)\n\n\nExperimental
  values are expressed as mean ± SD. Comparison of mean values between various groups
  was performed by one-way analysis of variance followed by multiple comparisons using
  the Tukey test. P value ;0.05 is considered to be significant.\n\n\n\n\nAfter concentration
  using a D101 macroporus resin column, the total triterpenoid content in ATT was
  93.0 ± 4.2% as measured by the colorimetric method. In ATT, the contents of ursolic
  acid and oleanolic acid were 43.5 ± 1.3% and 6.5 ± 1.5%, respectively, determined
  by HPLC. The apple total triterpenoids was used for bioactivity study.\n\n\n\nThe
  antiproliferative activity of apple peel 95% ethanol extract, apple total triterpenoids,
  ursolic acid, and oleanolic acid was evaluated by MTT assay. Their antiproliferative
  activities are given in Table 1. AP, ATT, UA, and OA showed potent antiproliferative
  activities against all four cancer cells, especially to human breast cancer cell
  lines. ATT showed the highest antiproliferative activity toward MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231
  cells, for which the IC50 values were 5.3 ± 0.8 and 4.7 ± 0.6 mg/L, respectively.
  Generally, ATT showed the highest antiproliferative activity against the four cells,
  compared to AP and its two main active constituents, UA and OA.\n\nTable 1. IC50
  Values for the Inhibition of Human Tumor Cells of AP, ATT, UA, and OA  \n\n\n\nATT
  was evaluated for in vivo antimammary tumor activity, since it showed significant
  antiproliferative activity against breast tumor cell lines in vitro. The in vivo
  antimammary tumor results are given in Figure 2. It is shown that ATT could reduce
  mammary tumor in a rat model. The total cumulative weight of observable mammary
  tumors in the group of ATT was substantially lower compared to control group, which
  also showed a strong dose–response trend. Meanwhile, the body weights of rats had
  a slight change after the treatment with ATT, which was quite different from the
  cisplatin group.\n\nFigure 2. The total cumulative weight of observable mammary
  tumors of each group at the 20th day of the first treatment.\n\nTable 2. Change
  in Body Weight of Rats after Different Treatments between the 1st and 20th Days
  of Treatment  \n\n\n\n\nEffect of ATT on Cell Cycle Kinetics and Quantitative Percentage
  of Apoptotic Cells on MDA-MB-231 Cell\n\nBased on morphologic observation, it was
  suggested that ATT induced MDA-MB-231 cell death involved in a mechanism of apoptosis.
  The cell cycle distributions of MDA-MB-231 cells were investigated by flow cytometry
  after treatment with ATT. The results showed that subdiploid peak was increased
  in a time-dependent manner, which suggested that ATT induced a classical apoptosis.
  To further confirm and quantify apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells triggered by ATT,
  cells were stained with Annexin V-FITC/PI and subsequently analyzed by flow cytometry.
  The percentage of apoptotic cells expressed as Annexin V positive cells investigated.
  After treatment with ATT at different time intervals, apoptosis increased from 12.5%
  to 32.0%. All the results above suggested that ATT could promote MDA-MB-231 cell
  apoptosis. Therefore, the apoptotic mechanisms were further investigated.\n\nFigure
  3. Effect of the ATT on cell cycle kinetics and quantitative percentage of apoptotic
  cells toward MDA-MB-231 cells. After MDA-MB-231 cells triggered by 5 mg·L–1 ATT
  at the indicated times, the cells were stained with Annexin V-FITC/PI and subsequently
  analyzed by flow cytometry. Percentage of apoptosis.\n\n\nCaspases are a family
  of 14 cysteine proteases that specifically cleave proteins at the C-terminal position
  of an aspartate residue, which can be activated by different apoptotic signaling
  to trigger apoptosis. To determine whether caspases contribute to the progress,
  the different caspase inhibitors were tested. The z-VAD-fmk, the z-DEVD-fmk, and
  the z-AEVD-fmk substantially promote the cell death, and the z-IETD-fmk effectively
  enhanced cell viability induced by ATT, but the z-LEHD-fmk had almost no effect
  on MDA-MB-231 cell viability. In order to further confirm the characteristic cell
  death impacted by caspase inhibitors, MDA-MB-231 cells treated by caspase inhibitors
  were assessed by LDH activity-based assays second. As shown in Figure 4B, both apoptosis
  and necrosis were increased in z-VAD and z-DEVD-fmk treated cells compared with
  ATT treated cells, and the morphological changes give similar results.\n\nFigure
  4. Effects of caspases on ATT induced MDA-MB-231 cell death. Effects of caspase
  inhibitors on 5 mg·L–1 ATT induced MDA-MB-231 cell death. The cells were cultured
  in the absence or presence of z-VAD-fmk(20 μmol·L–1), Ac-YVAD-cmk(20 μmol·L–1),
  z-DEVD-fmk(20 μmol·L–1), z-IETD-fmk(20 μmol·L–1), z-LEHD-fmk(20 μmol·L–1), and z-AEVD-fmk(10
  μmol·L–1), 1 h prior to the addition of ATT, and then incubated for 24 h. n = 5.
  Mean ± SD. p &lt; 0.05, p &lt; 0.01 vs 5 mg·L–1 ATT group. The characteristics of
  cell death were determined by LDH activity-based assays. MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured
  in the absence or presence of z-VAD-fmk(20 μmol·L–1), z-DEVD-fmk(20 μmol·L–1), z-IETD-fmk(20
  μmol·L–1), and z-LEHD-fmk(20 μmol·L–1), 1 h prior to the addition of ATT, and then
  incubated for 24 h. n = 3, mean ± SD.\n\n\nThe loss of mitochondrial transmembrane
  potential is a hallmark for apoptosis. It is an early event preceding phosphatidylserine
  externalization and coinciding with caspase activation.(27) Kinetic data indicate
  that mitochondria undergo major changes in membrane integrity before classical signs
  of apoptosis become manifest. These changes concern both the inner and the outer
  mitochondrial membranes, leading to a disruption of the inner transmembrane potential
  and the release of intermembrane proteins through the outer membrane. In this study,
  mitochondrial transmembrane potential was further assessed using rhodamine 123,
  a specific fluorescent probe for the analysis of mitochondrial transmembrane potential.
  The mitochondrial transmembrane potential decreased in a time-dependent manner,
  with the major decrease occurring at 36 h, suggesting that ATT induced MDA-MB-231
  cell apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway.\n\nFigure 5. Effect of ATT on
  the loss mitochondrial membrane potential in MDA-MB-231 cells. The cells were incubated
  with 5 mg·L–1 ATT at indicated times and then were stained with rhodamine 123 and
  analyzed by FCM.\n\n\nGenerally the PI3K/Akt pathway exerts its action in cell proliferation.
  Whether or not it is involved in ATT-treated MDA-MB-231 cells remains unknown, therefore
  the different inhibitors were tested. The PI3K family inhibitor, Akt inhibitor,
  PKC inhibitor, and PKCα inhibitor significantly promoted cell death. As shown in
  Figure 6B, both NF-κB inhibitor and the proteasome inhibitor promoted cell death.\n\nFigure
  6. The effect s of PI3K/Akt and NF-κB on ATT-treated MDA-MB-231 cells. The cells
  were cultured in the absence or presence of Akt inhibitor, staurosporine, H7, or
  wortmannin separately, 1 h prior to the addition of ATT, and then incubated for
  24 h. n = 5. Mean ± SD. p &lt; 0.05, p &lt; 0.01 vs 5 mg·L–1 ATT group. The cells
  were cultured in the absence or presence of PDTC or MG132 separately, 1 h prior
  to the addition of ATT, and then incubated for 24 h. n = 5. Mean ± SD. p &lt; 0.05,
  p &lt; 0.01 vs 5 mg·L–1 ATT group.\n\nThe total triterpenoids of apple were extracted
  and concentrated from apple peels. UA and OA were the main bioactive constituents
  of ATT. The extracts of apple peels and flesh demonstrated significant bioactivities,
  such as antioxidant and antimammary tumors.(2) These provide solid evidence that
  consuming apple has many health benefits. In the in vitro antiproliferative assay,
  AP, ATT, UA, and OA exhibited potent inhibitory action against the tested cell lines,
  especially to human breast tumor cell lines. Among them, ATT exhibited the strongest
  antiproliferative activity.\n\nThe ability of cancer cells to avert the apoptotic
  program has been identified as one of the major mechanisms for the development of
  cancers. The present studies demonstrated that ATT inhibited the proliferation of
  MDA-MB-231 cells dramatically. Based on morphologic observation, it is suggested
  that ATT induced MDA-MB-231 cell death involved in a mechanism of apoptosis. DNA
  histograms used for cell cycle analysis consistently showed the presence of apoptotic
  populations among cells treated with ATT. To ascertain that the mode of cell death
  was by apoptosis, Annexin V-FITC/PI-flow cytometry analysis was carried out. Apoptosis
  is characterized by distinct biochemical features, in which activation of catabolic
  processes and enzymes occurs before cytolysis, thereby facilitating cell morphological
  changes, such as PS externalization to the cell surface, mitochondrial alterations,
  etc. Early apoptotic cells tend to exhibit PS on the outer cell membrane, which
  is normally positioned across the inner membrane,(28) and it has a strong binding
  affinity to Annexin V.(29) Accordingly, early apoptotic and some late apoptotic
  cells can be quantified by flow cytometry assay with fluoresceinated Annexin V and
  DNA-binding fluorochrome.(30) The percentage of apoptotic cells expressed as Annexin
  V positive cells increased in a time-dependent manner.\n\nCaspases are a family
  of cysteine proteases, which cleave protein substrates after their Asp residues.
  They appear to be involved in regulating the activation of apoptotic signal transmission,
  but it has become apparent that cells frequently die even when caspase function
  is blocked.(31) The result of this study showed that pretreatment with the caspase
  inhibitors z-VAD-fmk, z-DEVD-fmk, and z-AEVD-fmk significantly enhanced ATT-induced
  cell death, the z-IETD-fmk reduced the cell death, but the z-LEAD-fmk had almost
  no effect on MDA-MB-231 cell viability, therefore it implied that caspase-independent
  apoptosis happened. In order to further confirm the characteristic cell death affected
  by caspase inhibitors, MDA-MB-231 cells treated by caspase inhibitors were assessed
  by LDH activity-based assays. Both apoptosis and necrosis were increased in the
  Z-VAD and Z-DEVD treated group compared with the ATT treated group, and the morphological
  changes gave similar results. It has been reported that reactive oxygen species
  are involved in caspase-independent cell death,(32) but ROS generation was not detected
  in ATT treated MDA-MB-231 cell, coinciding with Kengo’s result.(33) All these results
  suggest that the caspase-independent cascade happened in ATT-mediated MDA-MB-231
  cell apoptosis.\n\nActivation of the PI3K/Akt pathway is associated with tumorigenesis
  and resistance to apoptosis. Akt activation protects cells from a variety of apoptotic
  stimuli, including UV radiation and different classes of chemotherapeutic drugs
  and DNA damaging agents. Akt can also signal through to p53 by phosphorylating MDM2,
  resulting in its transport to the nucleus where it binds to p53 and promotes its
  degradation. Moreover, Akt inhibits apoptosis through the inhibition of Bcl-XL by
  the activation of NF-κB,(34) and NF-κB thus appears to be a target of the antiapoptotic
  Ras/PI3K/Akt pathway.(35, 36)\n\nThese results indicate that ATT-induced apoptosis
  of MDA-MB-231 cells may involve a mitochondrial-related pathway. Furthermore, other
  pathways regulating apoptosis should be further investigated.\n\nThis study demonstrated
  that the total apple triterpenoids could effectively inhibit tumor growth in vitro
  and in vivo. Also, apple peels contains much higher triterpenoids than apple flesh.(10,
  37) Therefore, consumption of whole apples may be an effective strategy for cancer
  protection.\n\n"
