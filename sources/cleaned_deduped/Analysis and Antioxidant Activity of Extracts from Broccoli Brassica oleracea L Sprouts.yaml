  Samples prepared from fresh broccoli sprouts by water distillation or freeze-drying
  were examined for antioxidant activity using three assays. All samples exhibited
  dose-dependent antioxidant activity. The antioxidant activity ranged from 74.48
  ± 0.46% to 93.2 ± 0.2% at the level of 500 μg/mL. Both dichloromethane extract samples
  from a water distillate of broccoli sprouts and freeze-dried broccoli sprouts showed
  potent antioxidant activity, which was comparable to that of BHT. Among the 43 compounds
  positively identified by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry, 5-methylthiopentylnitrile
  was found in the greatest concentration, followed by 4-methylthiobutylisothiocyanate,
  4-methylthiobutylnitrile, 3-methylthiopropylisothiocyanate, and 4-methylpentylisothiocyanate.
  These isothiocyanates are known to possess antioxidant properties. Possible phenolic
  antioxidants found are 4-(1-methylpropyl)phenol, 4-methylphenol, and 2-methoxy-4-vinylphenol.
  The present study demonstrates that broccoli sprouts are a good source of natural
  antioxidants.







  Broccoli is one of the most widely consumed vegetables in the United States. It
  contains various nutrients, including vitamins A, C, and K, as well as high levels
  of soluble fiber.(1) Recently, broccoli sprouts have received a great deal of attention
  because their bioactive constituents are somewhat different from those of mature
  broccoli and are reportedly even more effective than broccoli in the prevention
  of diseases caused by reactive oxygen species.(2, 3) In addition, sprouts have a
  much shorter cultivation period than mature plants, suggesting that they can be
  harvested before being damaged by diseases.


  The production and consumption of broccoli sprouts are steadily increasing. Even
  though there are many papers focusing on the antioxidant activity of fully developed
  broccoli, only a little information on the antioxidant activities of broccoli sprouts
  is available today. Moreover, reports on the antioxidant activity of the volatile
  compounds from broccoli sprouts are not yet available. Previous studies on broccoli
  have demonstrated that it contains antioxidants, including carotenoids, α-tocopherols,
  ascorbic acid, and phenolic compounds.(4-6) These antioxidants are known to scavenge
  reactive oxygen species and protect cells from oxidative damage.(7, 8) Recently,
  natural plants have received a great deal of attention as a source of natural antioxidants
  because some synthetic antioxidants, such as butylated hydroxytoluene, exhibit toxic
  effects.(9) If antioxidants can be found in broccoli sprouts, it would be possible
  to offer a speedier and more economical way to derive the health benefits already
  known to be associated with the consumption of broccoli.


  Over the past three decades, investigations into the antioxidants found in foods
  and natural plants have mainly focused on less volatile compounds or unextractable
  components, such as polyphenols(10) and flavonoids.(11) However, ever since the
  antioxidant activity of volatile heterocyclic compounds was reported in the late
  1990s,(12) volatile antioxidants have begun to receive much more attention. Accordingly,
  many volatile antioxidants, such as monoterpenoids,(13-16) have been found in foods
  and natural plants.(17) Therefore, searching for volatile chemicals that may be
  present in foods and plants is an important part of identifying health-beneficial
  foods and beverages. Moreover, natural medicinal plant essences containing volatile
  aroma chemicals have been used in medicinal aromatherapy since ancient times, suggesting
  that they offer beneficial health effects in addition to their pleasant odors.


  In the present study, volatile samples prepared from broccoli sprouts were examined
  for antioxidant activity and analyzed by gas chromatography and gas chromatography–mass
  spectrometry.





  N-Methylhydrazine, 1-methylpyrazole, 2-methylpyrazine, 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl,
  sodium dodecyl sulfate, and ferrous chloride were purchased from Sigma Chemical
  Co.. Cod liver oil, BHT, trizma hydrochloride, and trizma base were bought from
  Sigma Chemical Co.. Authentic chemicals were donated by Takata Koryo Co., Ltd..
  All other chemicals and solvents were obtained from reliable commercial sources.


  5-(Methylthio)pentylnitile, 3-(methylthio)propylisothiocyanate, and 4-(methylthio)butylisothiocyanate
  were synthesized according to a previously reported method.(18)


  Broccoli sprout seeds were provided by Cosmo Salad Co., Ltd. as a gift and cultivated
  according to a previously reported method.(19) Sprouts were harvested 7 days after
  germination.



  The entire scheme of the experimental procedures in the present study is shown in
  Figure 1.




  Fresh broccoli sprouts were placed in a 3 L round-bottom flask with 1 L of deionized
  water. The aqueous solution was water-distilled at 50 °C for 5 h under reduced pressure.
  The distillate was extracted with 250 mL dichloromethane using a liquid–liquid continuous
  extractor for 6 h. After the extract was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, the
  solvent was removed by a rotary flash evaporator and then placed under a purified
  nitrogen stream to yield brown viscous material. This material, labeled the volatile
  sample, was set aside to be used further for the antioxidant tests and GC-MS analysis.


  The residual broccoli sprouts in the distillation flask were mixed with 200 mL of
  methanol by stirring for 2 h and then filtered. The solvent of the filtrate was
  removed by rotary flash evaporator, and residual materials were freeze-dried and
  stored at 4 °C until used in the antioxidant tests.



  The volatile sample was placed in a glass column packed with 5 g of silica gel and
  eluted sequentially with the following 100 mL pentane/ethyl acetate solvent fractions:
  100/0, 95/5, 80/20, 50/50, 20/80, 0/100; finally, elution with 200 mL of acetone
  yielded fraction VII. The solvent of each fraction was removed by a rotary flash
  evaporator and then by a purified nitrogen stream to 1 mL in volume. The seven fractions
  prepared were stored at 4 °C until used for the antioxidant tests and GC-MS analysis.



  Fresh broccoli sprouts were freeze-dried at −48 °C for 48 h. The freeze-dried broccoli
  sprouts were extracted sequentially with 1 L each of hexane, dichloromethane, and
  acetone using a Soxhlet extractor. The extracts were dried over anhydrous sodium
  sulfate. After the solvent of each extract was removed by rotary flash evaporator,
  they were stored at −5 °C until used for the antioxidant tests.



  Components in the volatile sample were isolated and identified by GC and GC-MS.
  Identification was conducted by comparing the Kovats index(20) and MS fragmentation
  pattern of a GC component with those of an authentic chemical.


  The concentration of each compound in broccoli sprouts was calculated according
  to a previously reported method.(15)



  Three assays were used to examine the antioxidant activity of the samples. Details
  of the assays used in the present study were described in a previous paper.(21)
  A standard antioxidant, BHT, was used to validate the assays used.




  An aqueous assay solution containing 30 μL of cod liver oil, 0.25 mmol of trizma
  buffer, 1 μmol of ferrous chloride, 2 μmol of hydrogen peroxide, 0.75 mmol of potassium
  chloride, and 1% surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate was prepared. Various amounts
  of broccoli sprout samples were added to this assay solution and incubated for 17
  h at 37 °C in a 20 mL test tube. After incubation, 50 μL of 4% BHT solution was
  added to terminate the oxidation of the samples. After MA formed from cod liver
  oil in the test tube, it was derivatized to 1-methylpyrazole with N-methylhydrazine.
  The 1-methylpyrazole formed was eluted with 10 mL of ethyl acetate through an SPE
  cartridge. After 20 μL of GC internal standard was added, 2-methylpyrazine was added
  to the eluate, and the volume of the eluate was adjusted to exactly 10 mL with ethyl
  acetate. The eluate solution was analyzed for 1-methylpyrazole by GC. All experiments
  were carried out in triplicate.



  The DPPH solution was prepared in ethanol. DPPH solution and 0.5 mL of test sample
  were mixed using a vortex and stored in the dark for 20 min. After the reaction
  ran to completion, the absorption activity was measured at 517 nm using a UV–visible
  spectrophotometer. A solution without the testing sample was used as the control.
  All experiments were conducted in triplicate.



  This method is useful to test the long-term antioxidant activity, which is important
  for determining the shelf life of a product.(21)


  Various amounts of the volatile sample were added to a 2 mL dichloromethane solution
  of hexanal containing 0.2 mg/mL undecane as a GC internal standard. Standard antioxidant
  BHT was used to validate the method. Oxidation of the sample solution was initiated
  by heating at 60 °C for 10 min in a sealed vial and then stored at room temperature.
  The oxidation of hexanal to hexanoic acid was monitored at 5 day intervals by measuring
  the amount of hexanal using GC. All experiments were performed in triplicate.



  An Agilent model 6890 GC equipped with a 60 m × 0.32 mm i.d. DB-WAX bonded-phase
  fused-silica capillary column and an FID were used for obtaining a Kovats index
  of components in the volatile sample and its fractions. The linear velocity of the
  helium carrier gas was 28 cm/s at a split ratio of 10:1. The injector and detector
  temperatures were 260 and 300 °C, respectively. The oven temperature was programmed
  to increase from 50 to 210 °C at 2 °C/min and held for 30 min. An Agilent model
  6890 GC interfaced to a 5973 mass selective detector was used for mass spectral
  identification of the GC components at an MS ionization voltage of 70 eV. GC column
  conditions were exactly the same as the ones used for GC-FID.


  The quantitative analysis of 1-methylpyrazole for the MA/GC assay was performed
  using an Agilent model 6890 GC equipped with a 30 m × 0.32 mm i.d. DB-WAX bonded-phase
  fused silica capillary column and an NPD. The injector and detector temperatures
  were 250 °C. The oven temperature was programmed to increase from 60 to 160 °C at
  4 °C/min and held for 2 min. The linear velocity of the helium carrier gas was 28
  cm/s at a split ratio of 20:1.


  The quantitative analysis of hexanal for the aldehyde/carboxylic acid assay was
  conducted by using an Agilent model 6890 GC equipped with a 30 m × 0.25 mm i.d.
  DB-1 bonded-phase fused-silica capillary column and a FID. The linear velocity of
  the helium carrier gas was 30 cm/s at a split ratio of 20:1. The injector and detector
  temperatures were 300 and 280 °C, respectively. The oven temperature was programmed
  to rise from 40 to 180 °C at 5 °C/min and then held for 10 min.



  The data obtained from the present study were treated with an ANOVA analysis based
  on the SAS system, and the level of significance was determined using Duncan’s multiple-range
  test at α = 0.05.




  Antioxidant Activities of Samples Prepared by Freeze-Drying and Water Distillation


  Whereas spectrophotometric methods, such as DPPH assay, cause some difficulties
  because the absorption of color materials overlaps with that of the target chemical,
  the MA/GC assay can be applied to samples with dark colors because it measures MA
  specifically by GC. Therefore, the MA/GC method was used for the preliminary examination
  of the samples prepared from broccoli sprouts.


  Figure 2 shows the antioxidant activity of the samples examined by the MA/GC assay.
  The values are the mean ± SD. BHT showed antioxidant activities of 95.3 ± 0.2% at
  the level of 500 μg/mL, 92.2 ± 0.4% at the level of 100 μg/mL, and 87.2 ± 3.1% at
  the level of 20 μg/mL, confirming that the method used was valid. All samples exhibited
  dose-dependent antioxidant activity. The antioxidant activity ranged from 74.48
  ± 0.46% to 93.2 ± 0.2% at the level of 500 μg/mL, indicating that all samples contain
  strong antioxidants. The volatile sample showed 82.1 ± 2.4% at the level of 500
  μg/mL. Among the samples tested in this experiment, the sample prepared by Soxhlet
  extraction with dichloromethane solvent from the freeze-dried sample exhibited the
  most potent antioxidant activity. Its antioxidant activities were comparable to
  that of BHT.


  Figure 2. Results of MA/GC assay on the samples prepared from broccoli sprouts by
  freeze-drying and water distillation.


  Figure 3 shows the results of the DPPH assay. Values are the mean ± SD. The results
  are consistent with those of the MA/GC assay. The volatile sample was not tested
  in this experiment because it was tested by the aldehyde/carboxylic acid assay.
  BHT exhibited clear antioxidant activities with dose response effects: 85.0 ± 1.0%
  at the level of 500 μg/mL, 47.3 ± 3.9% at the level of 100 μg/mL, and 10.8 ± 0.2%
  at the level of 20 μg/mL, confirming that this assay is valid. Less volatile samples
  and acetone samples showed slight dose-dependent antioxidant activities: 30.42 ±
  0.17 and 31.7 ± 0.8% at the level of 500 mg/mL, respectively. Dichloromethane samples
  showed the most potent antioxidant activity among the samples tested in this experiment,
  which was the same as the results obtained by the MA/GC assay. The antioxidant activity
  of a dichloromethane sample was comparable to that of BHT at the level of 500 μg/mL.
  Also, dichloromethane and hexane samples exhibited moderate antioxidant activities
  at the level of 100 μg/mL, which were 39.1 ± 1.2 and 51.8 ± 0.6%, respectively.
  The less volatile and acetone samples showed only slight antioxidant activities.


  Figure 3. Results of DPPH assay on the samples prepared from broccoli sprouts by
  freeze-drying and water distillation.


  These results from two antioxidant assays suggest that potent antioxidants are present
  in the dichloromethane and hexane samples and that the amounts of water-soluble
  antioxidants are less than those of organic solvent extractable antioxidants in
  broccoli sprouts.


  Figure 4 shows the antioxidant activity of the volatile sample examined by the aldehyde/carboxylic
  acid assay over 30 days. This assay is useful in discovering the long-term antioxidant
  activities of a chemical or a group of chemicals.(21) The values are the mean ±
  standard deviation. SD ranged from 0.88 to 34.64. SDs lower than 1.0 do not appear
  in the figure. BHT showed &gt;99% antioxidant activity throughout the experiment.
  The volatile sample exhibited dose-dependent antioxidant activity. The control sample
  was completely oxidized after 30 days. By the 30th day, the antioxidant activity
  of the samples was 8% by 1 μg/mL, 29% by 5 μg/mL, 70% by 10 μg/mL, 98% by 50 μg/mL,
  and 99% by 100 and 500 μg/mL. The 50 and 100 μg/mL samples exhibited antioxidant
  activity comparable to that of BHT. The results suggest that broccoli sprouts contain
  antioxidants, the activity of which is maintained for prolonged periods.



  Figure 5 shows the antioxidant activity of the fractions obtained from the volatile
  sample tested by the aldehyde/carboxylic acid assay after 30 days. Values are the
  mean ± SD. BHT exhibited 99.84 ± 2.49% at the level of 10 μg/mL. Fractions I, II,
  and III exhibited potent dose-dependent antioxidant activity. In particular, fraction
  II showed activity comparable with that of BHT at the level of 10 μg/mL. On the
  other hand, fractions IV, V, VI, and VII exhibited only slight antioxidant activities
  at the levels tested in this experiment. These results suggest the presence of volatile
  nonpolar antioxidants in broccoli sprouts.


  Figure 5. Results of aldehyde/carboxylic acid assay after 30 days on fractions obtained
  from the volatile sample.


  According to the results obtained in the present study, samples prepared with dichloromethane
  seem to contain potent antioxidants. Therefore, the volatile sample was analyzed
  to determine the principal antioxidants in the sprouts.



  Table 1 shows the compounds identified in the volatile sample from broccoli sprouts,
  along with their calculated concentrations and Kovats index. Among the over 88 GC
  peaks observed in the gas chromatogram, 43 compounds were positively identified.
  The major compounds are 4-methylpentylisothiocyanate, 4-(methylthio)butylnitrile,
  5-(methylthio)pentylnitrile, 3-(methylthio)propylisothiocyanate, and 4-(methylthio)butylisothiocyanate.
  One recent study reported that these compounds possess strong anti-Helicobacter
  activity.(18)






  Dimethyl disulfide, 1-penten-3-ol, 2,4,5-trimethylthiazole, 3-(methylthio)propanal,
  allylisothiocyanate, 2-ethyl-1-hexanol, phenylethyl alcohol, 2-methoxy-4-vinylphenol,
  and 2-isothiocyanatoethylbenzene have also been reported as volatile components
  in various vegetables and fruits, including soybeans, mung beans, onions/sprouts,
  horseradish, cumin, kale sprouts, and persimmon, and some organic solvent extracts
  of these plants showed certain antioxidant activities.(22-24) When a headspace of
  raw and cooked broccoli was analyzed, dimethyl sulfide, dimethyl trisulfide, hexanal,
  and nonanal, which contribute to the characteristic aroma of broccoli, were identified.(25)
  4-(Methylthio)butylisothiocyanate, 2-phenylethylisothiocyanate, 5-(methylthio)pentylnitrile,
  and 1,2-dimethoxybenzene were also reported in raw broccoli in a previous study.(26)
  In broccoli stored under low-oxygen conditions, 3-hydroxybutan-2-one, 2-pentenol,
  hexanal, hexanol,-2,4-heptadienal, and phenylpropanenitrile were identified.(27)


  In this study, 4-methylpentylisothiocyanate, 3-(methylthio)propylisothiocyanate,
  and 4-(methylthio)butylnitrile were found as the major compounds found in broccoli
  sprouts but not in mature broccoli. The functional group −N═C═S in isothiocyanate
  compounds has been known to possess antioxidant activity, which induces phase II
  enzymes associated with detoxification of chemical carcinogens.(28)


  It is well-known that phenolic compounds found in plants possess antioxidant activity.(29)
  Possible phenolic antioxidants found in the present study are 4-(1-methylpropyl)phenol,
  4-methylphenol, and 2-methoxy-4-vinylphenol. A potent antioxidant activity of 2-methoxy-4-vinylphenol
  isolated and identified from a persimmon peel was previously reported.(30) Moreover,
  2-methoxy-4-vinylphenol found in brewed coffee possessed potent antioxidant activity
  at the level of 200 μg/mL tested by MA/GC assay.(31)


  Fraction I contained isobutylisothiocyanate, allylisothiocyanate, and 2-phenylethylisothiocyanate.
  A previous study has demonstrated that allylisothiocyanate was found as a volatile
  compound in Emeraude cauliflower and possessed strong antioxidant activity.(32)
  Fraction II contained 4-methylpentylisothiocyanate, 4-(methylthio)butylnitrile,
  5-(methylthio)pentylnitrile, 3-(methylthio)propylisothiocyanate, and 4-(methylthio)butylisothiocyanate.
  4-(Methylthio)butylisothiocyanate has direct antioxidant activity in addition to
  inducing phase II enzymes. It also oxidizes to sulforaphane, which has anticancer,
  anti-Helicobacter, and antioxidant activities.(18, 33) 4-Methylpentylisothiocyanate
  found in Raphanus sativus root induced apoptotic cell death in human cancer cell
  lines.(34) 4-(Methylthio)butylnitrile, 5-(methylthio)pentylnitrile, and 3-(methylthio)propylisothiocyanate
  were also reported in Emeraude and Magnifico cauliflower as major volatile compounds.(32)
  Fraction III also contained high levels of 4-(methylthio)butylnitrile and 5-(methylthio)pentylnitrile,
  which may have contributed to the antioxidant activity of this fraction. These nitrogen/sulfur-containing
  compounds comprised &gt;90% of the volatile sample and may significantly contribute
  to the antioxidant activity of broccoli sprouts.


  The less volatile sample also showed relatively moderate antioxidant activity with
  dose response effects as shown in Figures 2 and 3, suggesting the presence of water-soluble
  antioxidants. Therefore, the total antioxidant activity of the samples prepared
  from broccoli sprouts may be comparable to those of known antioxidants such as α-tocopherol
  and BHT. The present study demonstrated that broccoli sprouts have a strong potential
  to be a valuable source of antioxidants. Moreover, broccoli sprouts have a short
  harvest time and are relatively easy to produce. Therefore, broccoli sprouts could
  be a good source for natural antioxidants.
