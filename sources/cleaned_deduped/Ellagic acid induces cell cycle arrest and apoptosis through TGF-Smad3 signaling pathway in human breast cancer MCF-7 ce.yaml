  acid induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis through TGF-Smad3 signaling pathway
  in human breast cancer MCF-7 ce.md
text: '


  Breast cancer represents the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths among
  women worldwide and preventive therapy could reverse or delay the devastating impact
  of this disease. Ellagic acid, a dietary flavonoid polyphenol which is present in
  abundance in pomegranate, muscadine grapes, walnuts and strawberries, has been shown
  to inhibit cancer cells proliferation and induce apoptosis. Here, we investigated
  the growth inhibitory effects of EA on MCF-7 breast cancer cells. In the present
  study, we first found that EA inhibits the proliferation of MCF-7 breast cancer
  cells mainly mediated by arresting cell cycle in the G0/G1 phase. Moreover, gene
  expression profiling of MCF-7 breast cancer cell line treated with EA for 6, 12
  and 24 h was performed using cDNA microarray. A total of 4,738 genes were found
  with a &gt;2.0-fold change after 24 h of EA treatment. Among these genes, 2,547
  were downregulated and 2,191 were upregulated. Furthermore, the changes of 16 genes,
  which belong to TGF-/Smads signaling pathway, were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR
  and/or western blot analysis. TGF-/Smads signaling pathway was found as the potential
  molecular mechanism of EA to regulate breast cancer cell cycle arrest in vitro.
  Therefore, the regulation of TGF-/Smads pathway in breast cancer cells could be
  a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of patients with breast cancer. Further
  studies with in vitro models, as well as an analysis of additional human samples,
  are still needed to confirm the molecular mechanisms of EA in inhibition or prevention
  of breast cancer growth.'
