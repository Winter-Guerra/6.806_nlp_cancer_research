  Endogenous catecholamines such as adrenaline and noradrenaline are released from
  the adrenal gland and sympathetic nervous system during exposure to stress. The
  adrenergic system plays a central role in stress signaling, and excessive stress
  was found to be associated with increased production of reactive oxygen species.
  Overproduction of ROS induces oxidative damage in tissues and causes the development
  of diseases such as cancer. In this study, we investigated the effects of quercetin-3-O-glucuronide,
  a circulating metabolite of quercetin, which is a type of natural flavonoid, on
  the catecholamine-induced Î²2-adrenergic receptor-mediated response in MDA-MB-231
  human breast cancer cells expressing Î²2-AR. Treatment with A or NA at concentrations
  above 1 Î¼M generated significant levels of ROS, and NA treatment induced the gene
  expression of heme oxygenase-1, and matrix metalloproteinase-2 and -9. Inhibitors
  of p38 MAP kinase, cAMP-dependent protein kinase, activator protein-1 transcription
  factor, and NF-ÎºB and AP-1 decreased MMP2 and MMP9 gene expression. NA also enhanced
  cAMP induction, RAS activation and phosphorylation of ERK1/2. These results suggested
  that the cAMP-PKA, MAPK, and ROS-NF-ÎºB pathways are involved in Î²2-AR signaling.
  Treatment with 0.1 Î¼M Q3G suppressed ROS generation, cAMP and RAS activation, phosphorylation
  of ERK1/2 and the expression of HMOX1, MMP2, and MMP9 genes. Furthermore, Q3G suppressed
  invasion of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and MMP-9 induction, and inhibited the
  binding of -NA to Î²2-AR. These results suggest that Q3G may function to suppress
  invasion of breast cancer cells by controlling Î²2-adrenergic signaling, and may
  be a dietary chemopreventive factor for stress-related breast cancer.'
