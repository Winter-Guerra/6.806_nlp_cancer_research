  aberrant activity of mitogenic pathways. In breast cancers, pro-survival PI3K-AktmTOR-S6K1
  signaling pathway is often hyperactive due to overexpression of genes coding for
  growth factors or estrogen receptors, constitutive activation of PI3K or Akt and
  loss of PTEN, a negative regulator of the pathway. Since epidemiologic as well as
  rodent tumor studies indicate that sulforaphane, a constituent of many edible cruciferous
  vegetables, might be a potent inhibitor of mammary carcinogenesis, we analyzed the
  response of four breast cancer cell lines representing different abnormalities in
  ErbB2/ER-PI3K-AktmTOR-S6K1 signaling pathway to this compound.\n\n\n\nFour different
  breast cancer cell lines were used: MDA MB 231, MCF-7, SKBR-3 and MDA MB 468. Cell
  viability and ultrastructure, protein synthesis, autophagy induction and phosphorylation
  status of Akt and S6K1 kinases upon SFN treatment were determined.\n\n\n\nWe observed
  that all four cell lines are similarly sensitive to SFN. SFN decreased phosphorylation
  of Akt and S6K1 kinases and at higher concentrations induced autophagy in all studied
  cell lines. Moreover, global protein synthesis was inhibited by SFN in investigated
  cell lines in a dose-dependent manner.\n\n\n\nThese results indicate that SFN is
  a potent inhibitor of the viability of breast cancer cells representing different
  activity of the ErbB2/ER-PI3K-AktmTOR-S6K1 pro-survival pathway and suggest that
  it targets downstream elements of the pathway.\n\n\n\n\nAn erratum to this article
  can be found at http://​dx.​doi.​org/​10.​1007/​s00394-013-0513-y.\n\n\n\nHuman
  cancers frequently display abnormalities in signaling pathways that regulate cell
  proliferation and survival. In breast cancer, there is an increasing recognition
  of the pivotal role played by the growth factor receptors-PI3K-Akt-mTOR-S6K1 pathway.
  The ErbB2 receptor is overproduced in approximately one-third of breast tumors,
  and it correlates with poor clinical prognosis . Breast cancer therapies targeted
  against ErbB2, although very specific, do not apply to all patients as some cells
  become resistant. It often correlates with hyperactivation of PI3K, Akt and S6K1
  kinases or mutations in suppressor gene coding for PTEN phosphatase . Reduced PTEN
  protein expression was seen in 38 % of invasive cancers and in 11 % of in situ breast
  cancers . Moreover, estrogen receptor activation can directly drive the PI3K-Akt
  pathway. Constitutive activation of Akt is associated with the resistance to either
  tamoxifen treatment or estrogen deprivation in hormone-dependent cancers . Thus,
  targeting the critical downstream members of the pathways that cells remained dependent
  upon might be the way to overcome their resistance. Indeed, preclinical studies
  have shown that the mTOR antagonists can restore endocrine sensitivity in breast
  cancer cells .\n\nCruciferous plants are a rich source of bioactive isothiocyanates,
  including sulforaphane. It has been demonstrated that SFN or its precursor, glucoraphanin,
  reduced the number, size and rate of development of mammary tumors in rats treated
  with dimethylbenzanthracene . SFN decreased the DNA-adduct formation in normal mammary
  cells exposed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons . Chemopreventive activity of
  SFN is related to induction of enzymes responsible for mutagens elimination  and
  inhibition of phase I enzymes, which activate pro-carcinogens . SFN also induces
  cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of neoplastic cells . Among reported mechanisms
  underlying anticancer activity of SFN, there are oxidative stress induction , DNA
  damage checkpoint activation , inhibition of histone deacetylases  or direct binding
  to cellular proteins, such as tubulins . It has been shown that SFN-induced block
  in mitosis of human MCF-7 and murine F3II mammary cancer cells correlated with cdk1
  activation, cyclin B1 accumulation and disruption of mitotic microtubules polymerization
  . G2/M cell cycle arrest as well as apoptosis induction have been observed in a
  panel of different breast cancer cell lines treated with SFN . Interestingly, pathways
  leading to apoptosis were cell line specific with induction of Fas ligand and caspase
  8 in MDA MB 231 cells and activation of mitochondrial pathway in MDA MB 468, T47D
  and MCF-7 cell lines .\n\nIn our study, we addressed the question whether SFN affects
  pro-survival PI3K-Akt-mTOR-S6K1 signaling pathway. Thus, we tested sensitivity to
  SFN of four established breast cancer cell lines which have distinct characteristics
  regarding the status of the pathway elements: MDA MB 231 is estrogen-independent
  cell line with low level of ErbB2 and EGFR1 receptors, MCF-7 is estrogen receptor
  positive cell line with low level of ErbB2 and EGFR1 receptors, MDA MB 468 cells
  are devoid of PTEN repressor and possess high EGFR1 level and SKBR-3 cells overproduce
  receptor kinase ErbB2 . Our results indicate that, despite distinct signaling at
  the level of receptors, SFN decreases survival of all tested cell lines in a similar
  rate. Drop in phosphorylation of Akt and S6K1 kinases, inhibition of protein synthesis
  and autophagy induction strongly indicate that SFN targets elements of the pathway
  being downstream of receptors.\n\n\nPhenotypic characteristics and sensitivity to
  SFN of breast cancer cell lines  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nD,L-SFN4-NCS, purity 99 %) was purchased
  from LKT Laboratories. Tissue culture media, penicillin/streptomycin antibiotic
  mixture and fetal bovine serum were from GIBCO. DMSO, sodium pyruvate, thiazolyl
  blue tetrazolium bromide, the anti-β-actin, anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies
  conjugated with HRP were from Sigma. The antibodies against p-Akt and p-S6K1 were
  from Cell Signaling Technology.\n\n\n\nMonolayer cultures of MCF-7 cells were maintained
  in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. SKBR-3
  and MDA MB 468 cells were cultured in MEM containing 10 or 5 % FBS, respectively,
  and antibiotics. MDA MB 231 cells were maintained in MEM supplemented with 10 %
  FBS, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, non-essential amino acids and antibiotics. Each cell
  line was maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5 % CO2. D,L-sulforaphane
  was prepared in DMSO and stored at a stock concentration of 10 mM at −20 °C.\n\n\n\nCell
  viability was determined by MTT method. Cells were seeded at a density of 4 × 103
  per well of 96-well plate and allowed to attach overnight. The medium was replaced
  with fresh medium supplemented with DMSO, 5, 10, 20 or 30 μM SFN for 24 h. Before
  the end of treatment, 25 μl of MTT solution was added to each well. After 3 h of
  incubation, medium was removed and formazan crystals were dissolved in 100 μl of
  DMSO. Absorbance was measured at 570 nm in Victor3 microplate reader. Data were
  obtained from at least three independent experiments, each treatment condition assayed
  in triplicate.\n\n\n\nCells were grown on coverslips and allowed to attach overnight.
  The cells were transfected with pGFP-LC3 plasmid DNA, kindly provided by Dr. Tamotsu
  Yoshimori, using FuGene 6 according to manufacturer recommendations. After 24 h,
  cells were exposed to 40 μM SFN or equal volume of Me2SO for 6 h at 37 °C. After
  this time, cells were washed with PBS and fixed at 37 °C for 0.5 h using 2 % paraformaldehyde.
  Slides were mounted and analyzed under a Nicon Eclipse E800 fluorescence microscope.\n\n\n\nTo
  determine the effect of SFN treatment on autophagy induction, transmission electron
  microscopy was performed, as described previously  with some modifications. Briefly,
  cells were plated in 12-well plates and allowed to attach overnight. The cells were
  then treated with either 40 μM SFN or equal volume of vehicle, Me2SO for 6 h at
  37 °C. The cells were fixed in ice-cold 2.5 % electron microscopy grade glutaraldehyde
  in 0.1 M PBS. The specimens were rinsed with PBS, post-fixed in 1 % osmium tetroxide
  with 1 % potassium ferricyanide, dehydrated through a graded series of ethanol and
  embedded in Epon, Fluka. Semi-thin sections were cut using a RMC Power Tome XL ultramicrotome,
  stained with 0.5 % toluidine blue and examined under a light microscope. Ultrathin
  sections were stained with 2 % uranyl acetate and Reynold’s lead citrate and examined
  on a Philips CM100 transmission electron microscope.\n\n\n\nCells were treated with
  SFN as described above and lysed using a solution containing 50 mM Tris, 1 % Triton
  X-100, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails. The
  lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 15 min. Lysate proteins
  were resolved by SDS–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto PVDF
  membrane. The membrane was blocked with a solution containing 10 mM Tris, 150 mM
  NaCl, 0.1 % Tween-20 and 5 % non-fat dry milk and incubated with the desired primary
  antibody over night at 4 °C. The membrane was treated with appropriate secondary
  antibody for 1 h at room temperature. The immunoreactive bands were visualized by
  enhanced chemiluminescence reagent. The blots were stripped and reprobed with anti-β-actin
  antibody to normalize for differences in protein loading. The change in protein
  level was determined by densitometric analysis of the immunoreactive bands by Quantity
  One software followed by correction for the respective loading control. The immunoblotting
  for each protein was performed at least twice using independently prepared lysates.\n\n\n\nCells
  were cultured in 12-well plates and treated with 10, 20, 40 μM SFN for 3 h and 2
  μCi/well L--leucine. Both, floating and attached cells were collected, fixed in
  5 % TCA at room temperature for 30 min and washed with 5 % TCA for 15 min. The acid-insoluble
  material was dissolved in 0.1 mol/L KOH overnight at 4 °C, and aliquots were used
  to determine the radioactivity using liquid scintillation counter. Radioactivity
  of samples was normalized to cell number.\n\n\n\nData were analyzed using GraphPad
  Prism software. One-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s multiple comparison test was
  used to determine statistical significance of difference in measured variables between
  control and treated groups. Difference was considered significant at P ; 0.05.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe
  examined the effects of SFN on viability of four breast cancer cell lines: MDA MB
  231, MCF-7, MDA MB 468 and SKBR-3. These cell lines have been chosen as they represent
  examples of different abnormalities in PI3K-Akt-mTOR-S6K1 signaling pathway. MTT
  assay revealed that SFN inhibited viability of all cell lines in a dose-dependent
  manner. Moreover, anti-proliferative activity of SFN was similar in the case of
  all four cell lines, regardless of their PI3K-Akt-mTOR-S6K1 status, with IC50 ranging
  from 19 μM to 25 μM after 24 h of treatment.\n\n\nSulforaphane decreases viability
  of phenotypically different cells in a dose-dependent manner. MDA MB 231, MCF-7,
  MDA MB 468 and SKBR-3 cells were treated with DMSO or different concentrations of
  SFN for 24 h. Their viability was assayed by MTT method as described in “Materials
  and methods”. Each point is mean of three experiments done in triplicate\n\n\n\nIt
  has been previously shown that SFN induces autophagy in prostate cancer cells, which
  precedes and delays apoptotic cell death . Autophagy is an evolutionary conserved,
  lysosome-mediated process for degradation and turnover of long-lived proteins and
  whole organelles. The process begins with the formation of double-membrane vacuoles
  that engulf cytoplasmic material. Autophagosomes fuse with lysosomes where the inner
  membrane as well as the content is degraded. We sought to determine whether SFN
  induces autophagy in phenotypically different breast cancer cells. We examined the
  ultrastructures of control and SFN-treated cells by transmission electron microscopy.
  As can be seen in Fig. 2, SFN treatment promotes the formation of vacuoles filled
  with cytoplasmic material or showing different stages of its degradation in all
  four breast cancer cell lines. The number of membranous vacuoles is the highest
  in SKBR-3 cell line. To confirm that SFN-induced vacuolization is due to autophagy,
  we examined localization of LC3 protein in cells transiently transfected with plasmid
  encoding GFP-LC3 and treated or not with SFN. LC3 exists in two forms: as a cytosolic
  protein which is evenly distributed in cytoplasm and as a processed form bound to
  autophagosomal membranes. Fluorescent microscopy of cells expressing GFP-LC3 revealed
  diffuse localization of the fusion protein in the case of cells treated with DMSO.
  However, treatment with SFN induced punctuate pattern of GFP-LC3 fluorescence indicating
  recruitment of LC3-II to autophagosomes.\n\n\nUltrastructure of breast cancer cells
  in transmission electron microscopy treated or not with 40 μM SFN for 6 h. Arrows
  indicate autophagosomal vacuoles. Magnification ×1,650\n\n\nAutophagy induction
  by SFN in breast cancer cells revealed as punctuate localization of GFP-LC3, marker
  of autophagy. Cells were treated with DMSO or 40 μM SFN for 6 h. Magnification ×1,000;
  on the right panel, enlarged respective cell is shown\n\n\n\nExperimental evidence
  exists that mTOR is a negative regulator of autophagy . Given the ability of SFN
  to induce autophagy in breast cancer cell lines, we hypothesized that it can negatively
  influence activity of mTOR. Thus, we analyzed the phosphorylation level of mTOR
  substrate, p70S6K1 at Thr389, in four breast cancer cell lines treated with different
  concentrations of SFN. Immunoblotting experiments revealed that SFN inhibits phosphorylation
  of S6K1 even at the lowest used concentration. In case of MDA MB 231 and MCF-7 cells,
  SFN decreased p-Thr389-S6K1 level by 75 % at 10 μM concentration and by 80 % at
  higher concentrations of the compound. In MDA MB 468 cells, 10 μM SFN inhibited
  phosphorylation of S6K1 by only 10 % but 20 and 40 μM SFN—by 80–90 %. In SKBR-3
  cells, phosphorylation of S6K1 was inhibited by about 50 % in case of all studied
  concentrations of SFN.\n\n\nSFN decreases phosphorylation level of Akt and S6K1
  kinases in all studied cell lines. Immunoblotting for p-S6K1 and p-Akt using lysates
  from MDA MB 231, MCF-7, MDA MB 468 and SKBR-3 cells treated with different concentrations
  of SFN for 3 h. The blots were stripped and reprobed with anti-β-actin antibody
  to ensure equal protein loading\n\nThe mTOR is negatively regulated by TSC1/TSC2
  complex. Signal about growth factors availability activates mTOR through PI3K-Akt-mTOR
  pathway, where Akt kinase phosphorylates TSC2 resulting in TSC1/TSC2 inactivation
  . We sought to determine whether SFN affects phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473, position
  crucial for activation of this kinase. Western blotting using lysates from breast
  cancer cells treated with DMSO or different concentrations of SFN shows that the
  level of p-Ser473-Akt decreased gradually with increasing concentration of SFN in
  MDA MB 231, MDA MB 468 and SKBR-3 cells. In MCF-7 cells, SFN at all used concentrations
  inhibited Akt phosphorylation only by about 10–20 % compared with untreated controls.\n\n\n\nRecently,
  we reported that SFN inhibited mTOR-S6K1 signaling and translation process in PC-3
  prostate and SKBR-3 breast cancer cell lines . Results presented in previous subsections
  of this work suggest that SFN inhibits mTOR signaling in other breast cancer cells.
  As mTOR is a master activator of mRNA translation, we investigated the impact of
  SFN on protein synthesis in MDA MB 231, MCF-7 and MDA MB 468 cells. We measured
  -leucine incorporation in control, DMSO-treated cells and cells exposed to 10, 20
  or 40 μM SFN for 3 h. As demonstrated in Fig. 5, SFN inhibited -leucine incorporation
  in a dose-dependent manner. Protein synthesis in MDA MB 231 cells measured after
  3-h exposure to 10, 20 or 40 μM SFN dropped to about 75, 67 and 44 % of the level
  seen in control cells, respectively. Similarly, in MCF-7 translation decreased to
  about 60, 40 and 20 % and in MDA MB 468 to 78, 40 and 20 % of control cells level
  upon treatment with 10, 20 or 40 μM SFN, respectively.\n\n\nSFN inhibits protein
  synthesis in human breast cancer cells. MDA MB 231, MCF-7, MDA MB 468 were treated
  with various concentrations of SFN for 3 h in the presence of a protein precursor,
  \ –leucine. Cells were harvested, and radioactivity of TCA-precipitable material
  was estimated as described in “Materials and methods”. Results shown are mean ±
  SE of two independent experiments performed in duplicate or in triplicate, significantly
  different compared with DMSO-treated control by one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s
  multiple comparison test\n\n\n\nIn this work, we found that sulforaphane efficiently
  decreases survival of phenotypically distinct breast cancer cell lines which differ
  in the expression pattern of growth factor or estrogen receptors and PTEN suppressor.
  Although anti-proliferative activity of SFN against different breast cancer cell
  lines has already been reported, this is the first study exploring the effect of
  SFN on AktmTOR-S6K1 pro-survival pathway.\n\nPreviously, it has been reported that
  SFN at 15 μM concentration caused accumulation of MCF-7 and MDA MB 231 cells in
  G2/M phase of the cell cycle after 24 h treatment and longer incubation time resulted
  in apoptosis initiated by mitochondrial or death receptor pathway, respectively.
  Moreover, global HDAC activity, as determined with an in vitro activity assay, was
  inhibited by SFN in MCF-7, MDA MB 231 and, to a lesser extend, in MDA MB 468 and
  T47D cell lines . Authors also reported that IC50 of SFN did not differ significantly
  between these cell lines when treated for 48 h . Increased tubulin acetylation and
  suppression of microtubules dynamic instability was observed in MCF-7 exposed to
  15, 25 or 50 μM SFN . G2/M cell cycle arrest of MDA MB 231 cells was associated
  with increased p21 and p27 cdk-cyclin inhibitors and decreased levels of cyclin
  A, B1 and cdc2, and apoptosis was accompanied by decreased Bcl-2 and increased caspase-3
  level . The same authors showed that SFN induced autophagy in MDA MB 231 cells and
  this process played a protective role as its inhibition by bafilomycin A1 significantly
  enhanced SFN-induced apoptosis . It was also reported that sensitivity of breast
  cancer cells to SFN is connected with upregulation of p38 MAP kinase and caspase
  -7 activation in MCF-7 cells , global changes in gene expression  or downregulation
  of ER, EGFR or HER2 mRNAs . Other studies indicate that SFN-induced apoptosis of
  MCF-7 and MDA MB 231 cells is initiated by reactive oxygen species due to p66Shc
  translocation to mitochondria and collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential .
  Interestingly, non-tumorigenic human mammary epithelial MCF-10A cells were resistant
  to SFN-induced oxidative stress and cell death . Thus, it seems that cytotoxic effect
  of SFN is specific for cancer cells. Other reports confirm it. For instance, human
  mammary epithelial cell line, MCF-12A, was significantly more resistant to 48-h
  treatment with SFN comparing to cancer cells, MCF-7 wt and MCF-7/Adr . Moreover,
  30 μM SFN inhibited MCF-7 and ZR75-1 cancer cells proliferation by 80 % after 48-h
  exposure, while proliferation of non-tumorigenic mammary cells, MCF-10F, was inhibited
  by about 50 % as compared to the respective controls . Dose- and time-dependent
  growth inhibition with SFN was observed in MCF-7 and MDA 231 cells, while MCF-10A
  epithelial cells were more resistant, even to higher SFN concentrations. Interestingly,
  authors found that SFN-induced apoptosis in breast cancer cells was mediated by
  epigenetic regulation of telomerase gene expression . None of the above mentioned
  research explored connection of SFN activity with AktmTOR-S6K1 pathway in breast
  cancer cells.\n\nSignaling at the AktmTOR-S6K1 level is aberrantly activated in
  most human cancers. It is not surprising taking into account that all these kinases
  stimulate pro-survival processes. mTOR is a crucial regulator of translation and
  together with associated proteins, raptor, GβL, PRAS40 and DEPTOR, phosphorylates
  the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1, an inhibitor of cap-dependent
  translation, and the S6 kinase 1 which positively regulates different stages of
  protein synthesis . In addition to the role in translation, mTOR regulates the mRNA
  stability of some crucial cell cycle regulators, such as D cyclins or p27 cyclin-dependent
  kinase inhibitor as well as increases production of HIF1α, a transcription factor
  promoting expression of glycolytic genes .\n\nS6K1 plays a pleiotropic role in translation.
  It participates in ribosomal biogenesis, initiation of mRNA translation through
  phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4B and regulates translation
  elongation through phosphorylation of eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase . Besides,
  S6K1 plays crucial role in cell growth, progression of cell cycle and cell survival
  inactivating pro-apoptotic proteins and stimulating synthesis of anti-apoptotic
  survivin . S6K1 gene is amplified in 9 % of primary breast cancers which is associated
  with aggressive disease and poor prognosis of patients . Moreover, S6K1 phosphorylates
  ERα leading to its transcriptional activation, which may contribute to breast cancer
  progression .\n\nBoth mTOR and S6K1 activities may be stimulated by Akt kinase.
  It inactivates the tuberous sclerosis TSC1/2 inhibitors of mTOR. Importantly, Akt
  activates other pro-survival pathways. For instance, it inhibits pro-apoptotic proteins
  such as Bad or transcription factors of FOXO family, promotes p53 degradation and
  indirectly activates pro-survival NF-κβ transcription factor . AktmTOR-S6K1 are
  located downstream of PI3K, which is activated by membrane receptors, including
  the family of EGF receptors and the estrogen receptor. Hyperactivation of Akt due
  to activating mutations, gene amplification or enhanced signaling from receptors
  seems to be genetically selected during tumorigenesis and was found in many human
  cancers including carcinomas, glioblastoma multiforme and various hematological
  malignancies. Akt not only stimulates cancer cell growth and viability but also
  leads to resistance to chemotherapeutics, particularly these targeting only one
  element of the pathway. For instance, drugs targeting mTOR-S6K1 at the same time
  may stimulate Akt due to inhibition of negative feedback loop where active S6K1
  blocks growth factor-PI3K-Akt signaling . Moreover, cancer cells treated with inhibitors
  of growth factor or estrogen receptors often become resistant to therapy which is
  caused by changes in downstream signaling components, such as activating mutations
  of PI3K or Akt genes and loss of suppressors, such as PTEN. Thus, agents targeting
  this pathway at multiple levels might be a promising alternative. Indeed, preclinical
  studies have shown that the mTOR antagonists can restore endocrine sensitivity in
  breast cancer cells .\n\nHere, we show that SFN, isothiocyanate present in edible
  plants, targets the pro-survival pathway in breast cancer cells in at least two
  levels: Akt activation, determined as a drop in phosphorylation in the position
  crucial for the kinase activity, and mTOR-S6K1 signaling, determined as a decrease
  in S6K1 phosphorylation in the position recognized by mTOR. Inhibition of protein
  synthesis and induction of autophagy, both controlled by mTOR, confirm that SFN
  inhibits this pathway. We did not explore here the role of autophagy in the response
  of breast cancer cells to SFN. Even if it plays protective role such as in MDA MB
  231  or prostate PC-3 cells , it delays but not suppresses cell death.\n\nThe argument
  for parallel, rather than linear inhibition of Akt and mTOR by SFN, is different
  dephosphorylation pattern of Akt and S6K1 kinases upon SFN treatment shown on immunoblotting.
  Moreover, Akt activation is initiated by translocation to the plasma membrane mediated
  by docking of the PH domain in the N-terminal region of AKT to PI(3,4,5) P3 on the
  membrane, which results in a conformational change in Akt, exposing two critical
  amino acid residues for phosphorylation . On the other hand, generation of PI(3,4,5)
  P3 by PI3K is inhibited by mTOR-S6K1 signaling . Thus, drop in p-S6K1 should rather
  stimulate Akt activation if SFN targets only one signal transducer. Interestingly,
  previous studies on sensitivity of the panel of breast cancer cell lines to mTOR
  inhibitor, CCI-779, revealed that cells sensitive to CCI-779 were estrogen receptor
  positive, overexpressed ErbB2 and/or had lost the tumor suppressor gene product
  PTEN. On the other hand, resistant cell lines shared none of these properties .
  In our model, SFN inhibits viability of all tested cell lines, including MDA MB
  231, which also might indicate that it acts in at least two levels.\n\nTaken together,
  our data indicate that SFN might be a good therapeutics for breast cancers with
  different alterations of the PI3K-Ak-tmTOR-S6K1 pathway as it targets downstream
  elements of this pathway.\n\n\n\nWe are grateful to Dr. Tamotsu Yoshimori for generous
