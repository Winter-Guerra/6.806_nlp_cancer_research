text: '


  This work analyses the mutagenicity of seawater from mussel farms using the Vibrio
  harveyi mutagenicity test and its relationship with the accumulated pollutants and
  the development of gonadal neoplasia in mussels. Histological disorders identified
  as germinoma were observed in the gonad of Mytilus galloprovincialis during the
  period of study. The prevalence of this pathology is significantly correlated with
  certain levels of pollutants accumulated in mussels, mainly of PAHs and PCBs, whose
  toxic equivalents were calculated as EROD induction equivalency. The mutagenicity
  and toxicity of the water surrounding mussels farms is clearly correlated with the
  pollutants accumulated and with the neoplasia prevalence in mussels. Such correlations
  are corroborated by a multivariate analysis. Our results conclude with the utility
  of V. harveyi test as an optimal and rapid method in the monitoring of the quality
  of the water from mussel farms and as a tool to control the risks of pollution on
  mussel production and its safety for human food.'
