  Polyacetylenes of the falcarinol type are present in vegetables such as carrots
  and parsley. They display interesting bioactivities and hold potential as health-promoting
  and therapeutic agents. In this study, falcarinol, falcarindiol, falcarindiol 3-acetate
  and falcarindiol 3,8-diacetate were examined for their modulation on breast cancer
  resistance protein, an efflux transporter important for xenobiotic absorption and
  disposition, and multidrug resistance in cancer. Falcarinol, falcarindiol, and falcarindiol
  3-acetate were extracted from carrots and falcarindiol 3,8-diacetate prepared from
  falcarindiol. Their modulatory effects on ABCG2 were studied using three methods--mitoxantrone
  accumulation, vesicular transport, and ATPase assay. The polyacetylenes inhibited
  mitoxantrone efflux in ABCG2-overexpressing HEK293 cells. The inhibitory effect
  was confirmed in the vesicular transport assay, in which concentration-dependent
  inhibition of methotrexate uptake into ABCG2-overexpressing Sf9 membrane vesicles
  was observed. The polyacetylenes also inhibited baseline and sulfasalazine-stimulated
  vanadate-sensitive ATPase activities in ABCG2-overexpressing Sf9 membrane vesicles.
  This is the first report of an inhibitory effect of polyacetylenes on ABCG2. These
  results indicate a prospective use of polyacetylenes as multidrug resistance reversal
  agents, a possible role of ABCG2 in the absorption and disposition of polyacetylenes,
  and potential food-drug interactions between polyacetylene-rich foods and ABCG2
  substrate drugs.'
