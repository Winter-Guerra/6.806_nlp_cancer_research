  antiproliferative bioactivity of black raspberry fruits were extracted in ethyl
  acetate and isolated by semipreparative and analytical HPLC and analyzed by NMR,
  HPLC-ESI-MS, and ESI-MS/MS techniques. Here we present complete and partial structures
  of a variety of the chemical entities such as quercetin 3-glucoside, quercetin 3-rutinoside,
  myricetin glucoside, dihydrokaempferol glucoside, benzoic acid β-d-glucopyranosyl
  ester, 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid, epicatechin, caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid, p-coumaryl
  glucoside, p-coumaryl sugar ester, ellagic acid, methyl ellagic acid acetylpentose,
  methyl ellagic acid valerylpentose, trans-piceid, phloretin glucoside, dihydrosinapic
  acid, salicylic acid β-d-glucopyranosyl ester, a salicylic acid derivative without
  attached sugar, p-alkylphenyl glucoside, and a citric acid derivative. To our knowledge,
  15 of these compounds were not previously reported in black raspberry fruits.\n\n\n\nnonanthocyanin
  metabolites; bioactive compounds; NMR; HPLC-DAD; HPLC-ESI-MS; ESI-MS/MS; black raspberry;
  Rubus occidentalis L.\n\n\n\nStudies using animal and human subjects have indicated
  that freeze-dried black raspberry fruits have health benefits, most notably with
  regard to aero-digestive cancers.(1, 2) Anthocyanins such as cyanidin 3-rutinoside,
  cyanidin 3-xylosylrutinoside, cyanidin 3-glucoside, and cyanidin 3-sambubioside
  are major phenolic constituents of BR fruits, with 80% or more anthocyanin content
  being ascribed to Cy 3-rut, and Cy 3-xylrut.(3, 4) Many of the chemopreventive properties
  of BRs have been attributed to these main constituents, including reduced levels
  of oxidative stress, inflammation, mutagenesis, and cell proliferation and increased
  activity of inherent enzymatic defense mechanisms including pro-apoptotic activators.(5)\n\nHowever,
  anthocyanins alone do not account for all of the carcinostatic properties of BR
  fruits.(5, 6) For example, Wang and coauthors(6) reported that rat diets formulated
  with lyophilized BR powder, aqueous ethanol extracts of the powder, residue from
  these extracts and anthocyanin-rich extract fractions affect the development of
  esophageal cancer in a similar manner. These authors and others(5, 7-9) have considered
  several nonanthocyanin metabolites like ellagic acid, ellagitannins, urolithins,
  protocatechuic acid, ferulic acid, chlorogenic acid, gallic acid, p-coumaric acid,
  quercetin, flavonols, flavan 3-ols, and their derivatives and β-carotene as being
  important constituents for controlling the onset and progression of cancer.\n\nRecently,
  we reported the proliferation of HT-29 colon cancer cells to be differentially inhibited
  by 75 methanolic extracts of BR fruit obtained from different cultivars, produced
  on different farms or harvested at different stages of development.(10) Similar
  to previous reports,(5-9) the dissimilarity in cell assay results among extract
  treatments in this study could not be attributed solely to variable anthocyanin
  content of the fruit or the extracts as measured by the total monomeric anthocyanin
  technique.(11) Analysis by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy indicated the
  75 BR methanolic extracts to possess highly variable secondary metabolite profiles.
  As in our earlier study of similar BR extracts(4) resonances associated with the
  five predominant BR anthocyanins were clearly visible in these spectra. Defining
  1H resonances of nonanthocyanin BR metabolites in the extracts were also evident,
  but full structure determination of these constituents was achieved only after additional
  experimentation described herein.\n\nHere we report the qualitative study of the
  isolation of BR nonanthocyanin constituents, their fractionation by preparative
  and analytical HPLC, and their identification by 1H NMR, high performance liquid
  chromatography-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and electrospray ionization
  mass spectrometry-mass spectrometry methods. For fractions where sufficient materials
  could be isolated, we also employed a variety of advanced 1D and 2D NMR techniques.
  This approach has allowed the identification of several new compounds and new derivatives
  of known compounds that have the potential to play important roles in control of
  cancer cell proliferation.\n\n\n\n\nHPLC-grade methanol was purchased from Fisher
  Scientific. HPLC-grade water and deionized–distilled water were purchased from Lonza
  Walkersville, Inc.. Acetone, concentrated acetic acid, anhydrous sodium acetate,
  acetonitrile, ethyl acetate, trifluoroacetic acid-d, methanol-d4, tetramethylsilane,
  and standard samples of citric acid, trimethyl citrate, salicylic acid, 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic
  acid, p-coumaric acid, caffeic acid, ellagic acid, quercetin, quercetin 3-glucoside,
  quercetin 3-rutinoside, kaempferol, resveratrol, trans-piceid, myricetin, and epicatechin
  were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.\n\n\nAs described previously in detail by Johnson
  and co-workers,(10) methanol extracts were obtained from the juices of commercially
  ripe BR fruit samples varying in source, cultivar and maturity by solid phase extraction.
  Briefly, juices acidified with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid were loaded onto prewashed,
  H2O-equilibrated Strata C18-E, 5 g/20 mL SPE cartridges to isolate secondary metabolites
  of interest from other fruit constituents. The absorbed compounds were washed with
  acidified H2O to remove residual sugars, organic acids and other hydrophilic substances
  present in the juice. Secondary metabolites were then eluted from the column with
  acidified methanol, brought to dryness under a nitrogen stream delivered by an N-Evap
  system equipped with a water bath at 35 °C, lyophilized to remove residual moisture
  and stored at −80 °C until samples were prepared for 1H NMR analysis. Methanol samples
  are referred to by sample number.\n\n\nThe ethyl acetate extraction procedure described
  by Maatta-Riihinen et al.(12) was adapted for the HPLC collection of nonanthocyanin-rich
  metabolite fractions. Intact BR fruits resourced similarly to those described above
  were flash-frozen in liquid N2, stored at −80 °C, weighed and lyophilized. The freeze-dried
  BR fruits were manually crushed leaving seeds intact; the crushed drupelet tissue
  was then sieved to −80 mesh providing a fine powder for extraction. To obtain an
  array of secondary metabolites, powders were initially extracted with a phenolic
  extraction solvent comprised of acetone, HPLC-grade water and acetic acid solution
  using a method described by Singleton et al.(13) Initial extracts were concentrated
  by rotary evaporation under partial vacuum at 35 °C until concentrates were essentially
  free of acetone and acetic acid as determined by olfactory inspection. This extraction
  protocol solubilized simple phenolic aglycones and more polar conjugates but did
  not extract many of the more complex tannins.\n\nA subsequent extraction of the
  concentrate into ethyl acetate was employed to isolate simple phenolics, flavonols
  and other compounds of intermediate polarity from anthocyanins. For this procedure,
  each concentrate, was treated with an equal volume of 0.2 M aqueous sodium acetate
  and then this aqueous solution was partitioned against three to four sequential
  aliquots of ethyl acetate. The ethyl acetate aliquots were combined and then the
  solvent was evaporated under N2 to obtain a dried, yellow-red colored, phenolic-rich
  solid. Solids were stored at −20 °C for chromatographic fractionation.\n\n\nIndividual
  phenolic components or groups of constituents contained in the phenolic-rich solids
  were separated using semipreparative and/or analytical high performance liquid chromatography.
  Prior to injection, solids were redissolved in 1.0 mL of 30% acidic acetonitrile,
  then filtered through a 0.45 μm nylon filter.\n\nThe nonanthocyanin rich fractions
  were initially separated using semipreparative HPLC equipped with a Phenomenex Gemini
  C6-phenyl column. The column was held at 30 °C. Compounds were eluted using a programmed
  gradient of solvent consisting of Solvent A = acidified water; Solvent B = 100%
  CH3CN. The solvent composition ramp followed the gradient program: hold at 9% B
  from 0 to 10 min; transition to 22% B from 10 to 20 min; transition to 30% B from
  20 to 35 min; transition to 60% B from 35 to 40 min; hold at 60% B from 40 to 45
  min; transition 9% B from 45 to 50 min; hold at 9% B from 50 to 55 min. The solvent
  flow was maintained at a constant rate; the injection volume for each collection
  run was 50 μL. Column eluate fractions were collected from 19 to 54 min at 20 s
  intervals using a ProteomeLab FC fraction collector. Several series of collections
  were made. To obtain enough material for subsequent compound identification, injections
  were repeated as many as 49 times during a series and corresponding eluate fractions
  from all collection runs within the series were combined. Acetonitrile levels in
  fractions were reduced under an N2 stream, and the remaining aqueous fractions were
  frozen at −20 °C, lyophilized, and stored at −20 °C until analyzed by 1H NMR, HPLC-ESI-MS,
  and/or ESI-MS/MS.\n\nSubsequent series of fractionations were conducted for individual
  fractions if samples with higher purity were desired. These fractionations were
  conducted using an analytical HPLC system equipped with a Phenomenex Gemini C6-phenyl
  column. All other chromatographic parameters were identical to those described above
  except that the flow rate was reduced to 0.7 mL/min and eluate fractions were collected
  at 15 s intervals. Prior to NMR and LC-MS and/or MS/MS analyses, analytical chromatogram,
  and UV–vis absorption profiles of each of the individual fractions were recorded
  in the similar manner. Compounds isolated in chromatographic fractions are referred
  to by peak number.\n\n\nAll NMR investigations of methanolic BR extractions and
  of ethyl acetate extracted fractions of BR were conducted at 25 °C on a Varian INOVA
  750 MHz NMR spectrometer using a Varian triple-resonance 1H{13C/15N} pulsed field
  gradient cryoprobe and operating with VNMRJ 3.2a software unless otherwise specified.
  Solid materials from the column eluate of methanolic BR extractions were diluted
  with appropriate amounts of methanol-d4/trifluoroacetic acid-d and 5 mM DSS in methanol-d4
  to give 800 μL aliquots that contained 20 mg of dried berry extract and 0.5 mM DSS.
  The samples were filtered through glass wool then placed in 5 mm NMR tubes. Samples
  for NMR analyses of each nonanthocyanin fraction were prepared as follows: solid
  material was solubilized in an appropriate volume of a mixture of methanol-d4/trifluoroacetic
  acid-d, and tetramethylsilane was added as an internal chemical-shift reference
  standard. The solution was transferred to a 5 mm micro NMR tube tapered to a 2.5
  mm sample holding stem. Prior to running NMR experiments, all samples were stored
  at 4 °C.\n\n1H 1D NMR spectra of all samples were collected with a 90° pulse width
  of ca. 8 μs, a spectral width of 8609.6 Hz and a relaxation delay of 3.0 s. The
  data were acquired for an acquisition time of 2.7 s and 128 transients were averaged
  with presaturation of the HDO resonance at ca. 5.0 ppm. Data were processed with
  0.5 Hz exponential line broadening, zero filled to 128k points and Fourier transformed.
  The spectra of the methanolic BR extracts were referenced to DSS, and the spectra
  of the nonanthocyanin extracts were referenced relative to the CH3 resonance of
  TMS set to −0.016 ppm . For the nonanthocyanin samples, 1D selective excitation
  total correlation spectroscopy(14, 15) spectra were collected in the same manner
  using clean-MLEV17(14) spin locking pulse cycle with varying mixing time in the
  range 20–200 ms and spin locking field of ca. 8 kHz. For the gradient assisted double
  quantum filtered correlation spectroscopy homonuclear 2D experimental data collection,
  the acquisition time of 0.238 s and a 1H window of 8609.6 Hz, each for f2 and f1
  dimension was used. The coherence selection gradients of −0.09 and 0.18 T/m, each
  for duration of 1 ms, were used; 8 transients were averaged for each of 2 × 256
  free induction decays in which t1 was incremented to provide the spectral window
  of 8609.6 in the f1 dimension using the States(16) method of phase sensitive detection.
  Linear prediction was used in the f1 dimension to forward extend the data three
  times its original length; the data were zero filled to a 4096 × 4096 matrix, and
  weighted with a sinebell function before Fourier transformation. For some of the
  fractions, 2D rotating frame nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy, nuclear Overhauser
  effect spectroscopy, and 1D NOE difference experiments were also collected using
  mixing times in the range 100–500 ms. In addition, 2D heteronuclear NMR experiments
  were conducted which used Varian’s multiplicity-edited broad band selective adiabatic
  gHSQC sequence and Varian’s absolute value mode gradient assisted HMBC sequence.
  Additional information on the methodology for these 2D experiments can be found
  in Part 1 of the Supporting Information.\n\n\nSamples for LC-MS or MS/MS analyses
  were prepared by dissolving dry solid material from each of the BR fractions in
  an appropriate volume of 30% acidic acetonitrile so as to obtain solutions in the
  range 0.5–1.0 mg/mL. The sample solutions were vortexed for a few minutes and left
  at room temperature for 30–60 min. Prior to analyses, the insoluble materials in
  the samples were removed by filtering through a 0.2 μm Whatman Syringe filter.\n\nMost
  of the LC-MS and MS/MS experiments were conducted using an Esquire-LC quadrupole
  ion trap equipped with electrospray ionization source unless otherwise mentioned.
  For direct injection MS and MS/MS measurements, the sample solution was delivered
  using a syringe pump at a rate of 250 μL/min. The ESI source was operated at atmospheric
  pressure and was equipped with a grounded spray needle. The capillary voltage was
  set to ca. 4 kV, the offset potential between the plate electrode and capillary
  entrance was 0.5 kV, and the nebulizing nitrogen gas pressure was 10 psi. The drying
  gas used was also nitrogen, which was delivered at 8 L/min and the temperature of
  the drying gas was maintained to 250 °C. For LC-MS, the ESI source of the QIT instrument
  was interfaced with an Agilent HP 1100 HPLC system. The HPLC separation was conducted
  in the same manner as described above, except that the injection volume was 20 μL
  and the solvent flow was maintained at constant rate. To maintain the flow rate
  compatible with mass spectrometry, the column eluates were passed to the ESI source
  of the mass spectrometry system through a split flow controller. All LC-MS data
  collection was conducted in negative ion mode, unless otherwise mentioned.\n\n\n\nIn
  our previous research,(10) we demonstrated that 75 BR methanol extracts supplied
  in culture media to HT-29 colon cancer cells at high or low doses resulted in antiproliferative
  activity ranging from 33 to 118%. Concomitantly, the 1H NMR spectra of these extracts,
  some of which are illustrated herein, suggested potential bioactive compound concentrations
  to vary substantially among cell bioassay treatments. Resonances associated with
  cyanidin glycosides are prominent in these spectra because these compounds are present
  in fruits at levels that are two to 3 orders of magnitude greater than other BR
  secondary metabolites.(2) Among other chemoprotective functions, anthocyanins are
  well-known drivers of antiproliferation via their inhibition of cell-cycle mediators
  and promotion of caspase-induced apoptosis.(17) Specifically, BR anthocyanins have
  been reported to play a significant chemopreventive role in reducing tumor growth
  as well as in a number of other metabolic processes associated with cancer development.(1,
  2, 5, 6) However, the lack of a significant correlation between extract anthocyanin
  concentrations and their performance in our HT-29 colon cancer cell bioassay(10)
  and the reports of others(5-9) suggested the potential of additional extract components,
  the nonanthocyanin metabolites, as important cell cycle inhibitors or apoptosis
  promoters. Herein we have identified a cadre of these nonanthocyanin metabolites
  also evident in the 1H NMR spectra of the 75 BR extracts.\n\nFigure 1. 1H NMR spectra
  of two representative BR fruit extracts showing 1H spectral regions for anthocyanins
  and resonances from identified nonanthocyanin components of BR fruits.\n\nOverlapping
  signals in the NMR spectra can be a hurdle in the identification of individual metabolites.
  An even more challenging task is to identify the nonanthocyanin components in our
  extracts in which free phenolics contribute only a fraction of the total content
  of the fruits. J-correlated 1H 1D and 1H–1H homonuclear 2D NMR such as gDQCOSY can
  be used to ascertain some of the structural information from these complex signals.
  More difficult structural assignments can be assessed when additional information
  from 1H–13C heteronuclear 2D NMR such as HSQC and HMBC are combined. However, these
  studies using whole fruit extracts cannot provide sufficient information about the
  structures of minor components. To resolve these problems, we collected ethyl acetate-soluble
  BR fractions rich in one or more of the nonanthocyanin phenolic components by semipreparative
  and analytical HPLC. Collection of these individual fractions enormously reduced
  spectral overlap problems and allowed the identification of a number of nonanthocyanin
  metabolites in the BR extracts using 1H and 2D NMR, together with HPLC-ESI-MS, and
  MS/MS analyses. These metabolites included flavonoids, benzoic acid derivatives,
  cinnamic acid derivatives, ellagic acid and its derivatives, and other classes of
  compounds such as citric acid, phloretin, and resveratrol derivatives.\n\n\nFigure
  3 shows HPLC-DAD typical chromatographic profiles of ethyl acetate soluble fractions
  of nonanthocyanin secondary metabolites of BR fruits, where identifiable chromatographic
  signals associated with peaks P-1 to P-23 subjected to identification are labeled.
  The traces at 256 nm emphasize the detection of flavonol glycosides and ellagic
  acid derivatives whereas those at 306 nm show trans-piceid, phloretin glucoside,
  and hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives with greater sensitivity.\n\nFigure 3. C6-phenyl
  HPLC-DAD complete and detail chromatographic profiles of ethyl acetate soluble compounds
  from black raspberry fruits at two wavelengths 256 nm and 306 nm.\n\n\n1H NMR spectra
  of all fractions were obtained and the chemical shifts of the resonances and their
  spectral patterns are reported in Table 1. In addition, 1H 1D NMR spectra, and J-correlated
  and NOE/ROE based 1H–1H homonuclear, 2D NMR experiments were used as well as heteronuclear
  2D NMR techniques to determine connectivities and compound structures present in
  the fractions.\n\nTable 1. 1H and 13C Chemical Shifts of Resolved Resonances from
  Nonanthocyanin Constituents of Black Raspberry Fruits from 1H 1D and 1H–13C Heteronuclear
  2D NMR  \n\n\nIn MS analyses, the molecular ions were determined by full scan HPLC-ESI-MS
  or direct injection ESI-MS. ESI of nonanthocyanin-rich fractions often produced
  pseudo molecular ions of the form− or+/(M+Na)+. The negative ion mode MS was found
  to be more sensitive, and therefore the method of choice. Further structure verification
  was accomplished by tandem mass spectrometry, where fragment ions and loss of neutral
  species were important sources of structural information. For example, the neutral
  loss of hexose, deoxyhexose, pentose and acetylpentose were indicated by the loss
  of 162, 146, 132, and 174 Da respectively.\n\nWhenever possible, the HPLC-DAD, NMR,
  and MS data were also compared with literature values(18-31) and those of authentic
  standards. Examples of the application of these various methods to characterize
  specific compounds are described below.\n\n\nThe 1H NMR spectrum of a fraction containing
  P-22 shows resonances at 7.883 and 7.696 ppm, each integrating to one proton, were
  consistent with the asymmetrically substituted ellagic acid moiety of methyl ellagic
  acid acetylpentose . Based on 1H NMR resonances, their integrated areas, 2D NMR,
  and mass spectrometry data, the 1H resonances at 4.050 and 2.159 were attributed
  to methoxy and acetyl groups. The resonance at 3.784 ppm from a methoxy group, and
  two aromatic resonances at 7.878 and 7.858 ppm could be from an additional methyl
  ellagic acid derivative. HMBC 2D NMR spectra of P-22 showed multiple bond correlations
  from H-5 to C-7 and C-3 and H-5′ to C-7′, and C-1′, consistent with the ellagic
  acid moiety. Protons from OCH3 with a chemical shift of 4.050 ppm are also correlated
  to another carbon in the HMBC spectrum at δ13C = 152.1 ppm indicating a methoxy
  group attached to an aromatic carbon. Likewise, the multiple bond correlation from
  CH3 protons at 2.159 ppm to a carbon at 172.8 ppm indicated its attachment to the
  carbonyl carbon. The attachment of the acetyl group to the sugar was confirmed on
  the basis of mass spectrometry.\n\nFigure 4. 1H NMR spectrum and its expansions
  from a fraction containing P-22 showing the assignments of resonances from methyl
  ellagic acid acetylpentose.\n\nFigure 5. Selective regions from gHSQCAD and gHMBC
  spectra from the fraction containing P-22 showing single bond and multiple bond
  correlations from methyl ellagic acid acetylpentose.\n\nFigure 6. Negative ion mode

  MS of P-22.\n\nFigure 7. Negative ion mode MS2 spectra of anions obtained from P-22
  at m/z 489 and m/z 315.\n\nNegative ion mode HPLC-ESI-MS total ion mode chromatogram
  shows a peak that elutes between 39.0 and 40.8 min. The full scan MS of P-22 shows
  two significant anions at m/z 489 , and m/z 315. The MS2 spectrum of the anion at
  m/z 489 shows a daughter anion at m/z 315 produced by the loss of an acetylpentose
  group. The additional daughter anion at m/z 300, corresponding to the loss of CH3
  group from methyl ellagic acid, is confirmed from its own MS2 spectrum. These data
  are consistent with MEAAP in which an OCH3 group is attached to ellagic acid and
  an acetyl group is attached to a pentose sugar.\n\nThe presence of methyl ellagic
  acid valerylpentose was confirmed by mass spectrometry. Negative ion mode HPLC-ESI-MS
  TIC shows a main peak between 45.2 and 47.1 min. The full scan MS spectrum of P-23
  shows three significant anions at m/z 531, 315, and 300. The MS2 spectrum of the
  anion at 531 is very similar to the full scan MS of P-23; close inspection also
  shows a daughter anion at m/z 489 corresponding to methyl ellagic acid acetyl pentose,
  which is formed by the loss of 42 Da. Therefore, it is hypothesized that the anion
  at 531 m/z is methyl ellagic acid valerylpentose with a chain of three additional
  carbon atoms.\n\nFigure 8. Negative ion mode MS: HPLC-ESI-MS total ion chromatogram
  of a BR fraction containing P-23, full scan MS of P-23, and MS/MS spectrum of the
  P-23 anion at 531 m/z.\n\n\nThe rest of the nonanthocyanin constituents were identified
  in a similar manner. The structures identified are shown in Figure 2, and the results
  of the HPLC-ESI-MS, ESI-MS/MS and NMR analyses of all compounds in this research
  are summarized in Tables 1 and 2. Within this set, quercetin 3-rutinoside [(3),
  Q 3-rut),(32) caffeic acid,(9) 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid,(7, 9) epicatechin,(8)
  ellagic acid,(2, 7, 9, 32) and p-coumaric acid(32) have been previously reported
  in BR fruit. Casto and colleagues,(7) Khanal and colleagues,(8) Wu and colleagues,(9)
  and Stoner and colleagues(2) also reported the phenolic metabolites, catechin, ferulic
  acid, chlorogenic acid, and quercetin aglycone to be present in freeze-dried whole
  fruit powders.\n\nTable 2. Characterization of Nonanthocyanin Constituents of Black

  based on pseudomolecular ions —/ —/+/ +, and fragmentation pattern.\n\nIdentified
  compounds not previously reported as nonanthocyanin metabolites of BR fruit include:
  quercetin 3-glucoside, myricetin 3-glucoside, dihydrokaempferol glucoside, benzoic
  acid glucosyl ester , p-coumaryl glucoside, p-coumaryl sugar ester, MEAAP and methyl
  ellagic acid valerylpentose, phloretin glucoside, dihydrosinapic acid, salicylic
  acid glucosyl ester , and salicylic acid derivative . However, in their review,
  Lee and colleagues(33) cited studies reporting the presence of Q 3-glc, p-coumaryl
  sugar esters, kaempferol glycosides and other derivatives, sinapic acid, salicylic
  acid, methyl ellagic acid pentoses in other Rubus species. Also, Milivojevic and
  colleagues(34) reported myricetin to be present in a wild strain and two cultivars
  of red raspberry and Humpf and Schreier(35) identified free benzoic acid and benzyl
  alcohol in evergreen blackberry. Cho and colleagues(36) found phloretin glucoside
  in fruits of Korean black raspberry and Wu and colleagues(9) detected phloretic
  acid in the gastrointestinal tract of pigs fed freeze-dried BR fruit powder, but
  not in the powder itself.\n\nTo our knowledge, p-alkylphenyl β-d-glucopyranoside,
  trans-piceid and citric acid derivative have yet to be reported as constituents
  of Rubus fruits. The identities of the R-groups associated with the citric acid
  derivative are currently under investigation. However, to verify that this compound
  was not an artifact of extraction, additional LC-MS/MS analyses ascertained that
  neither free citric acid nor methyl citrate were present in SPE-isolated, methanolic
  extracts of BR juice .\n\nAlthough anthocyanins are major berry constituents that
  effectively impede multiple cancer developmental processes and promote apoptosis,(5)
  they likely act with other secondary metabolites to orchestrate these effects.(37)
  Nonanthocyanin secondary compounds such as flavonols(38), flavan-3-ols(39), flavanonols(40),
  hydroxybenzoic acids(41, 42), hydroxycinnamic acids(43), ellagic acid and its derivatives
  and metabolites,(44) stilbenes(45), dihydrochalcones(46) and citrate(47) have demonstrated
  definitive chemopreventive activity against various forms of cancer. In this study
  we found a wide variety of nonanthocyanin secondary metabolites with potential bioactivity
  present in BR fruits; fifteen of these compounds have not been reported previously
  to be BR fruit constituents. Since these metabolites are present at concentrations
  approximately 10–2 to 10–3 less than those of the major anthocyanins,(2) their structural
  characterization required the separation of components into individual or groups
  of compounds via HPLC followed by 1H NMR, additional 1D and 2D NMR, HPLC-ESI-MS,
  and MS/MS analyses of compounds within fractions. Structures were resolved by combining
  complementary information from these analyses. Investigations similar to our BR
  study that identify the minor components in complex bioactive mixtures derived from
  fruits and vegetables are fundamental to metabolomic approaches exploring the potential
  synergistic mechanisms that underlie the health-beneficial dietary effects of fresh
  and processed produce.\n\n\nPart 1: 1H selective TOCSY spectra of BR methanolic
