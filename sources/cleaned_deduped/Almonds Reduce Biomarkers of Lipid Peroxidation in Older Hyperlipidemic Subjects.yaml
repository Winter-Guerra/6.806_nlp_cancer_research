  Nut consumption has been associated with reduced coronary heart disease risk. In
  addition to cholesterol-lowering properties, almonds have been shown to lower oxidized
  LDL concentrations. However, little is known regarding their effects on other markers
  of oxidative stress. The dose-response effects of whole almonds, taken as snacks,
  were compared with low-saturated fat whole-wheat muffins in the therapeutic diets
  of hyperlipidemic subjects. In a randomized crossover study, 27 hyperlipidemic men
  and women consumed 3 isoenergetic supplements each for 1 mo. Supplements consisted
  of full-dose almonds, half-dose almonds plus half-dose muffins, and full-dose muffins.
  Subjects were assessed at wk 0, 2 and 4. Mean body weights differed ; or = 300 g
  between treatments, although the weight loss on the half-dose almond treatment was
  greater than on the control. At 4 wk, the full-dose almonds reduced serum concentrations
  of malondialdehyde and creatinine-adjusted urinary isoprostane output compared with
  the control. Serum concentrations of alpha- or gamma-tocopherol, adjusted or unadjusted
  for total cholesterol, were not affected by the treatments. Almond antioxidant activity
  was demonstrated by their effect on 2 biomarkers of lipid peroxidation, serum MDA
  and urinary isoprostanes, and supports the previous finding that almonds reduced
  oxidation of LDL-C. Antioxidant activity provides an additional possible mechanism,
  in addition to lowering cholesterol, that may account for the reduction in CHD risk
  with nut consumption.'
