  Tree nuts contain an array of phytochemicals including carotenoids, phenolic acids,
  phytosterols and polyphenolic compounds such as flavonoids, proanthocyanidins and
  stilbenes, all of which are included in nutrient databases, as well as phytates,
  sphingolipids, alkylphenols and lignans, which are not. The phytochemical content
  of tree nuts can vary considerably by nut type, genotype, pre- and post-harvest
  conditions, as well as storage conditions. Genotype affects phenolic acids, flavonoids,
  stilbenes and phytosterols, but data are lacking for many other phytochemical classes.
  During the roasting process, tree nut isoflavones, flavanols and flavonols were
  found to be more resistant to heat than the anthocyanins, PAC and trans-resveratrol.
  The choice of solvents used for extracting polyphenols and phytosterols significantly
  affects their quantification, and studies validating these methods for tree nut
  phytochemicals are lacking. The phytochemicals found in tree nuts have been associated
  with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-proliferative, antiviral, chemopreventive
  and hypocholesterolaemic actions, all of which are known to affect the initiation
  and progression of several pathogenic processes. While tree nut phytochemicals are
  bioaccessible and bioavailable in humans, the number of intervention trials conducted
  to date is limited. The objectives of the present review are to summarise tree nut:
  phytochemicals; phytochemical content included in nutrient databases and current
  publications; phytochemicals affected by pre- and post-harvest conditions and analytical
  methodology; and bioactivity and health benefits in humans.'
