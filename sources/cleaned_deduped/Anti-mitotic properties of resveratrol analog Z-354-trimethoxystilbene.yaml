  properties of resveratrol analog Z-354-trimethoxystilbene.md
text: '


  -3,5,4-Trimethoxystilbene is a natural polyphenol present in five different plants,
  Virola cuspidata, Virola elongata, Centipeda minima, Schoenus nigricans and Rheum
  undulatum. This molecule was prepared in a three-step sequence in good overall yield.
  The isomerisation from the - to -isomer is performed using UV irradiation. Biological
  investigations were conducted on a human colon cancer cell line  with anti-mitotic
  activities. Growth was completely arrested at an added 0.4 microM level of -3,5,4-trimethoxystilbene.
  This agent is 100-fold more active than resveratrol or -3,5,4-trihydroxystilbene,
  and the mechanism of this process involves an inhibition of tubulin polymerisation
  in a dose dependent manner.'
