  Luteolin is a flavonoid that has been identified in many plant tissues and exhibits
  chemopreventive or chemosensitising properties against human breast cancer. However,
  the oncogenic molecules in human breast cancer cells that are inhibited by luteolin
  treatment have not been identified. This study found that the level of cyclin E2
  mRNA was higher in tumour cells than in normal paired tissue samples as assessed
  using real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis. Further,
  relatively high levels of CCNE2 protein expression were detected in tamoxifen-resistant
  MCF-7 cells. These results showed that the level of CCNE2 protein expression was
  specifically inhibited in luteolin-treated TAM-R cells, either in the presence or
  absence of 4-OH-TAM. Combined treatment with 4-OH-TAM and luteolin synergistically
  sensitised the TAM-R cells to 4-OH-TAM. The results of this study suggest that luteolin
  can be used as a chemosensitiser to target the expression level of CCNE2 and that
  it could be a novel strategy to overcome TAM resistance in breast cancer patients.'
