  Twelve highly pigmented vegetables were investigated for their total anthocyanin
  contents and compositions of the individual anthocyanins and anthocyanidins by UPLC
  and LC-DAD-ESI-MS, and their antioxidant activities by DPPH, FRAP and ORAC assays.
  While a total of 26 anthocyanins were identified, the main aglycones were only found
  to be limited to 4 anthocyanidins. The TAC ranged from 0.08 to 2.01 mg Cyanidin-3-glucoside/g
  DW and the total phenolic contents was from 1.30 to 2.19 mg GAE/g DW suggesting
  that anthocyanins were the main phenolics in certain vegetables but not others.
  DPPH radical scavenging activities were 54.91-81.94%, FRAP values 10.00-70.07 Î¼mol
  AAE/g DW and ORAC values were 3.74-189.32 Î¼mol TE/g DW. The two cruciferous vegetables
  showed the highest TPC, TAC, DPPH and FRAP values, and the onions the lowest. The
  antioxidant activities in the DPPH and FRAP assays correlated well with the TPC
  and TAC, but ORAC did not. Results of this study are comparable and provide a rapid
  and effective method for the identification and quantification of all major anthocyanidins
  and their glycosides, and how they might contribute to the antioxidant activity,
  therefore important information in developing anthocyanin-rich nutraceuticals and
  functional foods.'
