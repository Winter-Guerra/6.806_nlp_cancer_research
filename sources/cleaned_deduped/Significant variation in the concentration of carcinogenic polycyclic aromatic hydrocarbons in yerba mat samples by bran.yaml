  of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. In 2006, we found high but variable polycyclic
  aromatic hydrocarbon content in commercial yerba maté samples from eight Brazilian
  brands. The PAH content of new samples from the same brands, purchased in 2008,
  and four brands from a single manufacturer processed in different ways, obtained
  in 2010, were quantified to determine whether PAH concentration was still high,
  whether PAH content variation was brand specific, and whether processing method
  affects PAH content of commercial yerba maté. Concentrations of individual PAHs
  were quantified using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry with deuterated PAHs
  as internal standards. Median total PAH concentration was 1500 ng/g and 1090 ng/g
  in 2008 and 2010 samples, respectively. Comparing 2006 and 2008 samples, some brands
  had high PAH concentrations in both years, while PAH concentration changed considerably
  in others. Benzopyrene concentrations ranged from 11.9 to 99.3 ng/g and 5.11 to
  21.0 ng/g in 2008 and 2010 samples, respectively. The 2010 sample processed without
  touching smoke had the lowest benzopyrene content. These results support previous
  findings of very high total and carcinogenic PAH concentrations in yerba maté, perhaps
  contributing to the high incidence of ESCC in southern South America. The large
  PAH content variation by brand, batch, and processing method suggests it may be
  possible to reduce the content of carcinogenic PAHs in commercial yerba maté, making
  it a healthier beverage.\n\n\n\nEsophageal cancer, the sixth most common cause of
  cancer death in the world, has a striking geographical variation in both incidence
  and mortality.(1) Southern South America, including Uruguay, Paraguay, southern
  Brazil, and northern Argentina, is one of the areas with high incidence rates of
  EC.(1, 2) This geographic clustering suggests that some environmental factors and/or
  habits specific to this area are risk factors for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma,
  the dominant histological type of EC in South America.\n\nPrevious research has
  shown that in addition to alcohol consumption and tobacco smoking, which are known
  to cause ESCC in many parts of the world, drinking maté, a habit common to southern
  South America, may also increase risk of ESCC.(3-5)Maté is a drink prepared from
  dried leaves of the plant yerba maté, and it is consumed in high quantities by many
  people in this region.(3) The average per capita annual consumption of processed
  yerba maté leaves in this region has been estimated to be between 5 and 8 kg.(6)
  While a causal link between maté drinking and ESCC is not yet certain, it is highly
  probable. A number of studies have shown a consistent association between amount,
  duration, and temperature of maté consumption and risk of ESCC.(3, 5, 7) Two plausible
  mechanisms proposed for the carcinogenecity of maté are chronic mucosal irritation
  due to repeated thermal injury after drinking hot maté, and exposure to carcinogenic
  components of the drink, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.(3, 5, 7) We focus
  on the latter mechanism in this paper.\n\nPAHs are compounds produced during incomplete
  combustion of organic materials, including tobacco and coal. PAH exposure has been
  shown to be high in a number of areas with very high rates of ESCC.(8-11) Humans
  may be exposed to PAHs in many ways, including inhalation of tobacco smoke, exposure
  to air pollution, eating foods cooked at high temperature, jobs such as coal mining,
  and therapeutic use of coal tar.(12) Of these, smoking tobacco is the most common
  major source of PAH exposure. Recent evidence shows that maté drinking may also
  be a major source of PAH exposure, possibly causing as much exposure as smoking
  tobacco.(8, 13)Yerba maté leaves undergo several processing steps before they are
  sold commercially, including slow drying using wood smoke. The drying process, which
  takes approximately 8–24 h, can result in high concentrations of PAHs in commercial
  yerba maté.(14, 15)\n\nA study by our group in Brazil showed that consuming maté
  led to a strong dose-dependent increase in the urine concentration of 1-hydroxypyrene
  glucuronide, a stable metabolite of PAHs.(8) In a second study, we measured the
  concentrations of 21 PAHs in the leaves of 8 commercial yerba maté brands and in
  hot and cold maté extracted from two of these brands, and we found very high PAH
  concentrations in all of the leaf and beverage samples. Of special interest, we
  found up to a 4-fold variation among brands in the PAH content of the yerba maté
  leaves.(13) This variation may be of public health importance, because if PAHs are
  responsible for the increased risk of ESCC associated with maté drinking, then it
  may be possible to reduce the cancer risk by processing yerba maté in ways that
  result in a lower PAH content. As a follow-up to this second study, we purchased
  new samples of the same brands of yerba maté and repeated the PAH measurements to
  substantiate our previous findings of high concentrations and variation of PAHs
  in yerba maté and to learn whether the differences in PAH content were brand-specific
  or they simply reflected batch-to-batch variation within each brand. In addition,
  we obtained four different brands of yerba maté that were made by the same company
  but processed in different ways, including one brand that was never exposed to smoke
  during the processing of the yerba maté leaves, to see if such different processing
  methods might affect the PAH content of the commercial product.\n\n\n\nIn our previous
  study in 2006, we purchased eight packaged commercial brands of yerba maté in Santa
  Maria, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, and measured 21 individual PAHs in the dry yerba
  maté leaves.(13) In 2008 we purchased new loose samples of the same 8 yerba maté
  brands from a market in Porto Alegre, RS, and quantified the concentrations of 26
  individual PAHs. In 2010 we obtained four additional packaged commercial brands
  of yerba maté leaves from one of the major yerba maté manufacturers, with a request
  to test these brands for PAH content. Three of these brands were processed in the
  traditional way and one was processed in an alternative way in which the leaves
  were never exposed to smoke. In these four brands, we quantified the concentrations
  of 22 individual PAHs. Of the individual PAHs measured in the 2006, 2008, and 2010
  samples, 20 were the same among the three studies, and the rest were study specific.
  All measurements were performed in the Analytical Chemistry Division of the National
  Institute of Standards and Technology using the same validated methods used for
  the 2006 samples.(13) Standard Reference Materials 2260a Aromatic Hydrocarbons in
  Toluene, SRM 2269 Perdeuterated PAH-I, SRM 2270 Perdeuterated PAH-II, and SRM 1649a
  Urban Dust were obtained from the Standard Reference Materials Group, NIST. One
  subsample from each brand of yerba maté from the 2008 samples or 3 subsamples from
  the 2010 yerba maté samples and one subsample from one bottle of SRM 1649a were
  put into pressurized fluid extraction cells containing hydromatrix and mixed with
  the hydromatrix. Hydromatrix was then used to fill the void space of the cells.
  A solution prepared from diluting SRM 2269 and SRM 2270 was added to each extraction
  vessel for use as the internal standard solution. The fact that only one subsample
  was tested from each of the 2008 samples was a limitation of the study, but this
  was unlikely to have affected our overall findings.\n\nBecause some fine yerba maté
  particles came through with the extract, the entire extract was eluted through a
  silica plus Sep Pak column that was preconditioned with 20% dichloromethane in hexane
  for the 2008 samples or 10% for the 2010 samples. The yerba maté extract was then
  eluted from the Sep Pak using 20 mL of the same solvent mixture. The eluents from
  the Sep Pak were concentrated to approximately 0.5 mL using an automated evaporation
  system prior to gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis.\n\nThe column used
  for the GC/MS analysis was a 0.25 mm × 60 m fused silica capillary column containing
  a 50% phenyl methyl-substituted polysiloxane phase, 0.25 μm film thickness. All
  injections were done on-column with helium as a carrier gas at a constant flow rate
  of 1.2 mL/min.\n\nA calibration curve bracketing the concentrations in the yerba
  maté samples was determined for each analyte of interest by linear regression of
  response data from gravimetrically diluted solutions of SRM 2260a mixed with the
  internal standard solution. These calibration solutions, as well as the blank extract,
  were taken through the entire procedure.\n\n\nAll PAH concentrations were rounded
  to three significant figures. For each of the measured PAHs, median concentrations
  were calculated separately for the samples purchased in 2008 and for the samples
  obtained in 2010. Pairwise Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated to
  compare the distribution of PAH concentrations in different brands. This analysis
  was done to examine whether there was a consistent pattern in the PAH concentrations
  of processed yerba maté. All analyses were done using Stata, version 11. Two-sided
  p-values less than 0.05 were considered as statistically significant.\n\n\n\nThe
  concentrations of the 20 PAHs analyzed in both the 2008 and 2010 samples are shown
  in Table 1. The median concentration of these 20 PAHs in the yerba maté samples
  purchased in 2008 was 1500 ng/g, with a range from 625 to 3710 ng/g. In the 2010
  samples, the median concentration was 1090 ng/g, and the range was from 621 to 1990
  ng/g. The concentration of the carcinogenic PAH benzopyrene ranged from 11.9 to
  99.3 ng/g in the 2008 samples and from 5.11 to 21.0 ng/g in the 2010 samples. The
  lowest concentration of benzopyrene was found in the “Brand A” brand of the 2010
  samples. The concentrations of total PAHs in the Brand C and Brand D brands of the
  2010 samples were in the same range as most of the brands in 2006 and 2008, while
  the Brand A and Brand B brands appeared to be similar to the low-PAH brands in the
  previous series.\n\nTable 1. Concentrations of the 20 PAHs in All Samples of the
  Commercial Brands of Yerba Maté Leaves Purchased in 2008 and 2010a  \n\n\n\nThe
  concentrations of the 20 PAHs are given in 16 rows because the concentrations of
  phenanthrene and anthracene were reported together, the concentrations of triphenylene
  and chrysene were reported together, and the concentrations of benzofluoranthene,
  benzofluoranthene, and benzofluoranthene were reported together as benzofluoranthene.
  ND, not detected.\n\nFigure 1. Total PAH concentrations in the 2006, 2008, and 2010
  yerba maté samples.\n\nThere was a strong and statistically significant positive
  pairwise correlation in the distribution of individual PAH concentrations between
  each two of the twelve brands purchased in 2008 and 2010. This indicates that the
  relative content of the individual PAHs in different maté brands was similar. For
  example, in the 2008 samples, benzopyrene made up approximately 2%, fluoranthene
  14%, and phenanthrene 27% of the overall PAH content in all brands. These results
  suggest that we can measure a limited number of PAHs, e.g., 2 or 3, rather than
  20, to obtain a good measure of the total PAH content of maté; and the PAH content
  of maté may have one main source, which produces a similar distribution of PAHs.\n\nTable

  Maté Samplesa  \n\n\n\nThe P-value for all the Spearman correlations was less than
  0.01 except for the correlation between brand D and brand 6 and 7.\n\nTo evaluate
  batch-to-batch variation of the same eight yerba maté brands in 2006 and 2008, we
  compared the absolute values of the total PAH concentrations of the 20 PAHs that
  were measured in both years. Some brands had high or low total PAH concentrations
  in both years. For example, Brand 6 had the second highest concentration of PAHs
  in both 2006 and 2008. Brand 8 had relatively low concentrations and ranked seventh
  in both years. However, some brands changed considerably in their rank. For example,
  Brand 1, which had the highest concentration of PAHs in 2006, ranked sixth in 2008.
  Conversely, Brand 5, which had the lowest concentration of PAHs in 2006, had one
  of the higher concentrations of PAHs in the 2008 samples. Examining individual PAHs,
  we also found high batch-to-batch variation in six of the eight brands, with some
  having higher and some having lower concentrations in the new samples. For example,
  benzopyrene concentrations in the 2006 and 2008 samples were 50.0 and 18.9 ng/g
  for Brand 1, and 52.5 and 99.3 ng/g for Brand 4.\n\nFigure 2. Benzopyrene concentration
  in the 2006, 2008, and 2010 yerba maté samples. The dashed line shows the benzopyrene
  content of the yerba maté brand that never touched smoke.\n\nThe lowest concentration
  of benzopyrene in any of the yerba maté samples, 5.11 ng/g, was found in the 2010
  brand which was processed without ever touching smoke. Figure 2 shows the concentrations
  of benzopyrene in the 2006, 2008, and 2010 yerba maté samples, with the horizontal
  line denoting the benzopyrene concentration of the brand prepared without touching
  smoke.\n\nOur analysis of the commercial yerba maté samples purchased in 2008 and
  2010 supports our previous findings of very high total and carcinogenic PAH concentrations
  in most commercial yerba maté, and shows again that there is a consistent pattern
  to the distribution of the PAHs present in the leaves. Comparing the 2006 and 2008
  samples, we observed relatively large batch-to-batch differences in most brands.
  And in the 2010 samples, we saw differences in PAH concentrations made by the same
  company but processed in different ways.\n\nPAH contamination of yerba maté may
  come from several sources, including environmental pollution, but probably the most
  important source is the traditional way of drying the leaves, during which the leaves
  are smoked.(14, 15) PAH contamination of other foods can happen during preparation,(16-18)
  and it has been shown that yerba maté leaves acquire PAHs during the drying process.(15)
  Of all of the yerba maté samples tested in all three years, the concentration of
  benzopyrene was the lowest in the 2010 brand that had never touched smoke during
  the drying process, suggesting that this method of processing may be a promising
  one for reducing the PAH content of commercial yerba maté.\n\nThe high PAH content
  found in yerba maté leaves in this study and in our previous study supports a role
  for PAHs in the etiology of ESCC. The IARC working group on the evaluation of carcinogenic
  risks to humans has classified benzopyrene as “carcinogenic to humans”,(12) and
  exposure to this carcinogenic PAH has been shown to be high in several high-risk
  areas for ESCC.(8, 10, 11, 19) Furthermore, we have previously shown that the usual
  practice of repeated infusions of the same yerba maté leaves can elute more than
  50% of the benzopyrene content of the leaves into either hot or cold maté drinks.(13)\n\nIn
  southern Brazil, maté is traditionally prepared and drunk in gourds called “cuias”.
  These cuias usually hold 100–200 mL of liquid, and are filled with yerba maté leaves
  up to two-thirds of their volume, about 50–100 g of leaves.(20) The 16 traditional
  yerba maté brands that we analyzed in 2006 and 2008 had a median benzopyrene concentration
  of 40.1 ng/g of leaves. If we round this to 40 ng/g and assume an average use of
  50 g of leaves per cuia and a 50% elution of the benzopyrene from the leaves into
  the fluid, then drinking an average cuia of maté in the traditional way would expose
  the consumer to 40 ng/g × 50 g × 0.5 elution = 1000 ng of benzopyrene, equivalent
  to the benzopyrene content of the smoke from 100 cigarettes.(21) In contrast, if
  the benzopyrene concentration of the yerba maté leaves was equal to that of the
  2010 brand that never touched smoke, approximately 5 ng/g of leaves, then drinking
  the same cuia in the same way would expose the consumer to 5 ng/g × 50 g × 0.5 elution
  = 125 ng of benzopyrene, equivalent to the benzopyrene content of the smoke from
  12.5 cigarettes.\n\nOne must be cautious, however, in implying similar biological
  effects from similar amounts of external PAH exposure from maté drinking and cigarette
  smoking, since the internal exposure of this intake may differ by the route of administration.(12)
  It is possible that gastric absorption may be less efficient, and thus the biological
  effect per ng of gastric exposure may be less. This possibility is supported by
  the fact that in the same population, urinary 1-OHPG, a valid short-term marker
  of total internal PAH exposure, has been shown to be almost equal between cigarette
  smokers who do not drink maté and maté drinkers who do not smoke cigarettes.(8)
  But whatever the exact equivalency, a substantial reduction in external PAH exposure
  from any source will most likely be beneficial to individual and public health.\n\nGiven
  the high prevalence of maté consumption in certain areas of South America,(6, 22,
  23) the population-attributable fraction of ESCC due to maté drinking has been estimated
  to range from 10% to 79%,(3, 5, 24) which implies that reducing consumption or reducing
  the carcinogens in it could potentially lead to a substantial decrease in the burden
  of ESCC. While implementing strategies to eliminate maté drinking in this region
  may not be feasible, diminishing the carcinogenic content of this common exposure
  would be a plausible preventive approach. Diminishing the PAH content of maté could
  also reduce other adverse effects of PAH exposure, including its effects on cardiovascular
  diseases.(25)\n\nWe observed large differences in PAH concentrations between brands
  and within each brand of yerba maté over time. This is not surprising, since it
  is difficult to control the exact amount of smoke to which the yerba maté leaves
  are exposed during the traditional drying process. But these differences by brand
  and batch suggest that very high PAH content is probably not essential for marketing
  yerba maté, so it may be possible to reduce the PAH content of processed yerba maté
  without significantly affecting its quality or marketability. The lower levels of
  total PAH and carcinogenic benzopyrene in the commercial yerba maté brand that had
  not been exposed to smoke are consistent with this hypothesis.\n\nIt is probable
  that most commercial maté producers, along with the general public, have not been
  aware that maté drinking currently has health risks as well as health benefits,
  and that at least some of these risks might be avoided if the drying methods were
  changed. It is also possible that there may be a difference in taste after different
  processing methods, which may make long-time maté drinkers not want to switch to
  a “smokeless” brand, but this has not yet been evaluated. The best solution would
  be to find processing methods that could significantly reduce PAH exposure and still
  keep optimal taste.\n\nIn summary, the results of this study confirm high concentrations
  of total and carcinogenic PAHs in most commercial yerba maté leaves, and suggest
  that these concentrations may possibly be reduced by altering the processing of
  the leaves. Reducing the PAH content of commercial yerba maté is a sensible precaution
  which will probably make maté a healthier beverage. Given the popular use of maté,
  the public health impact of such a reduction could be significant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis
  study was supported in part by funds from the intramural program of the National
  Cancer Institute, NIH and in part by an interagency agreement between the NIH and
  the National Institute of Standards and Technology.\n"
