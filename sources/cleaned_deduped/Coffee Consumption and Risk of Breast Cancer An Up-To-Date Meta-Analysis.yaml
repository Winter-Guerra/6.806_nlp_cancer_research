  Consumption and Risk of Breast Cancer An Up-To-Date Meta-Analysis.md
text: "\n\nThis updated meta-analysis was conducted to assess the association between
  coffee consumption and breast cancer risk.\n\nWe conducted a systematic search updated
  July 2012 to identify observational studies providing quantitative estimates for
  breast cancer risk in relation to coffee consumption. Pooled relative risks  with
  95% confidence intervals  were calculated using a random-effects model, and generalized
  least square trend estimation was used to assess doseresponse relationships.\n\nA
  total of 26 studies  on coffee intake with 49497 breast cancer cases were included
  in the meta-analysis. The pooled RR showed a borderline significant influence of
  highest coffee consumption, low-to moderate coffee consumption, or an increment
  of 2 cups/day of coffee consumption  on the risk of breast cancer. In stratified
  analysis, a significant inverse association was observed in ER-negative subgroup.
  However, no significant association was noted in the others.\n\nOur findings suggest
  that increased coffee intake is not associated with a significantly reduced risk
  of breast cancer, but we observe an inverse association in ER-negative subgroup
  analysis. More large studies are needed to determine subgroups to obtain more valuable
  data on coffee drinking and breast cancer risk.\n\nCitation: Li XJ, Ren ZJ, Qin

  interests:  The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.\n\nBreast
  cancer is the most common type of female malignancy all over the world. Coffee,
  one of most known risk factors, may be crucial in the etiology of breast cancer.
  The association between coffee intake and breast cancer risk is biologically plausible
  because of its complex make-up of chemicals, e.g., caffeine and polyphenolic compounds
  such as flavonoids and lignans . Coffee can play a dual role as both a carcinogen,
  in which it enhances cell proliferation, and a chemo-preventive agent with anti-oxidative
  and weakly estrogenic properties,. A number of previous epidemiologic studies have
  estimated the association between coffee consumption and breast cancer risk. However,
  the results were inconsistent. An earlier meta-analysis relating the consumption
  of coffee to cancer of various sites by Arab  reported a null association with breast
  cancer risk. But another meta-analysis published in 2009 suggested that high coffee
  consumption was associated with a borderline reduction of breast cancer risk. Since
  the meta-analysis, several large prospective cohort studies have estimated the association
  between coffee consumption and breast cancer risk . Therefore, to provide an updated
  results on this topic, we systematically conducted a meta-analysis by combining
  all available data of both casecontrol and cohort studies.\n\nWe searched the databases
  MEDLINE and EMBASE to identify relevant studies published in English through July
  2012. The following keywords were used in searching: caffeine, coffee, or dietary
  factors, combined with breast cancer, breast carcinoma, or breast neoplasm. We also
  reviewed references cited in the selected articles. The eligible studies had to
  meet the following criteria:  They had a casecontrol or cohort study design;  The
  outcome of interest was primary breast cancer;  The exposure of interest was coffee
  consumption.  Relative risk  and their 95% confidence intervals  could be extracted
  or calculated from relevant articles.\n\nThe following information was extracted
  from each included study: first authors last name, study design, country of origin,
  study period, number of cases and subjects, adjustment for potential confounders,
  the exposure to coffee consumption, RR and corresponding 95% CIs for every category
  of coffee intake. For each study, low coffee consumption was defined as the reference
  category, high coffee consumption as the greatest degree of control, and moderate
  coffee consumption fell in between. All the data were extracted independently by
  two authors, and the disagreement was solved by discussion.\n\nStudy-specific RRs/odds
  ratios  and 95% CIs for low to moderate consumption and high consumption level were
  extracted from each study, and then we pooled the overall RR/OR using the inverse
  of the corresponding variances as weights. Because breast cancer is rare, ORs in
  casecontrol studies yield similar estimates of RR. Heterogeneity of effect size
  across studies was tested by I2 statistics. We calculated summary estimates of the
  RR using random-effects models, which consider both within- and between-study variation.
  Sensitivity analyses were also conducted, in which one study at a time was removed
  to analyze the influence of a single study on the pooled RR.\n\nTo obtain the information
  on a doseresponse relationship, we considered the increment of 2 cup per day,. For
  each study, we calculated the median cups of coffee consumption for each category
  by assigning the midpoint of upper and lower boundaries in each category as the
  average consumption. If the upper bound was not provided, we assumed that it had
  the same amplitude as the preceding category. Because this method requires the risk
  estimates with their variances for at least 3 quantitative exposure categories,
  we excluded studies showing two categories of exposure only . And the summary RR
  for breast cancer risk with 2 cups/day increment of coffee consumption was obtained
  by pooling the corresponding study-specific RRs with random-effects models.\n\nStudies
  were not eligible if the required data were not reported or could not be estimated.
  If coffee consumption was indicated by milliliter, we defined 125 ml of coffee equal
  to 1 cup.\n\nThe subgroup analyses according to geographic region, ER status, and
  menopausal status were performed to assess the potential effect of these variables
  on outcomes. The funnel plots with Beggs rank correlation and Egger regression tests
  were performed to detect publication bias. All statistical analyses were performed
  with STATA.\n\nWe initially identified 186 potentially eligible studies. Most were
  excluded because the exposure or endpoint was not relevant to our analysis. After
  assessing the full-text of the 36 potentially relevant articles, we identified 26
  eligible studies , , . The main reasons for exclusion were as follows: 5 studies
  \ did not provide a 95% CI. We tried to contact with authors for original data,
  but we got no reply. Because of relative small sample and poor study design, these
  original data was not necessary for meta-analysis; 2 studies,  were conducted among
  male subjects. We further excluded the other 3 studies, because they evaluated the
  association in BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation carriers . Finally, 16 cohort studies ,,
  \ and 10 case-control studies,,,  were included in the meta-analysis. A flow chart
  showing the study selection process is presented in Figure 1.\n\nFigure 1.  Flow
  chart of the selection of publications included in the meta-analysis.\n\nWe identified
  26 studies including 49497 incident cases of breast cancer and 863067 participants
  that were eligible for meta-analysis , , . The characteristics of the included studies
  are summarized in Table S1. By study design, 10 casecontrol studies,,,  and 16 prospective
  cohort studies ,, . By geographic region, 12 studies were conducted in Europe,,,,,,,,,
  , 11 in the United States,,,,,,,,,,  and 3 in Asia,,. One study  only adjusted for
  age, whereas the other 25 studies adjusted for a wide range of potential confounders
  for breast cancer, including age, BMI, family history of breast cancer, smoking,
  alcohol, geographic area, parity, age at first birth, age at menarche and menopause,
  oral contraceptive and other female hormone use.\n\nThe multivariable-adjusted RRs
  in each study and the pooled RR of breast cancer for the highest versus lowest categories
  of coffee intake are presented in Figure 2 and Table 1. The pooled RR of breast
  cancer for the highest versus lowest categories of coffee intake was 0.96. Stratifying
  by study design, the pooled RRs for casecontrol studies and cohort studies were
  0.93  and 0.98, respectively. Stratifying by geographic region, the summary RRs
  were 0.96  for studies performed in Europe, 0.97  for studies performed in the United
  States, and 0.92  for studies performed in Asia. Stratifying by estrogen receptor
  status, the pooled RRs for ER-negative studies and ER-positive studies were 0.81
  \ and 1.01, respectively. According to menopausal status, the pooled RR for premenopausal
  cancers was 1.00, and the pooled RR for postmenopausal cancers was 0.92. Figure
  3 and Table 1 present the estimated RRs for low to moderate versus lowest coffee
  consumption, according to selected covariates. The summary RR was 0.99  for low
  to moderate versus lowest coffee consumption. In the subgroup analysis by study
  design, no increased risk was found for either cohort studies  or casecontrol studies.
  Stratified analyses were also performed according to geographic region. The RR was
  1.00  when considering 11 studies conducted in Europe, 0.78  for 9 studies from
  United States and 1.00  for 3 Asian studies. In addition, No significant differences
  by Menopause status were found.\n\nFigure 2.  Forest plot of casecontrol and cohort
  studies of the risk of breast cancer for the highest versus lowest coffee drinking
  categories.\n\nThe combined Relatives risks  and 95% confidence intervals  were
  calculated using the random-effects model.\n\nFigure 3.  Forest plot of casecontrol
  and cohort studies of the risk of breast cancer for the low-to-moderate versus the
  lowest coffee drinking categories.\n\nThe combined Relatives risks  and 95% confidence
  intervals  were calculated using the random-effects model.\n\n23 studies were included
  for the doseresponse analysis of coffee intake and risk of breast cancer , . The
  pooled RR for a 2 cups per day increment in coffee intake was 0.98, similarly for
  cohort studies  and casecontrol studies. The summary RRs were 0.98  for studies
  conducted in Europe, 0.98  for studies conducted in the United States, and 0.98
  \  for studies conducted in Asia. When grouped by menopausal status, the pooled
  RR for premenopausal cancers was 0.91, and the pooled RR for postmenopausal cancers
  was 0.93.\n\nFigure 4.  Forest plot of casecontrol and cohort studies of the risk
  of breast cancer for the increment of two cups of coffee per day.\n\nThe combined
  Relatives risks  and 95% confidence intervals  were calculated using the random-effects
  model.\n\nThere was no indication of publication bias from either visualization
  of the funnel plot, Beggs test, or Eggers test. The sensitivity analysis confirmed
  the stability of our results.\n\nThis meta-analysis showed a borderline significant
  association between coffee consumption and decreased risk of breast cancer. The
  results of our meta-analysis were consistent with those in the earlier meta-analysis
  which contained 25250 cases. Moreover, in the subgroup analysis by estrogen receptor
  status, we observed a significant inverse association between high coffee consumption
  and breast cancer risk. There was, however, relevant heterogeneity across studies,
  particularly according to study population and menopausal status. The relatively
  small sample size in Asia and the difference in the definition of menopausal status
  might contribute to the result.\n\nThe mechanisms by which coffee may affect breast
  carcinogenesis are complex and remain unclear. Coffee can both stimulate and suppress
  the development of mammary tumors in vitro,. Coffee might contain compounds that
  differentially affect breast cancer of different ER subtypes. For example, coffee
  has been shown to significantly contribute to levels of plasma enterolactone, a
  phytoestrogen reported to be associated with a significant decrease in ER-negative
  breast cancer risk. The presence of such compounds that specifically attenuates
  the risk of ER-negative breast cancer may contribute to our result in ER-negative
  subgroup analysis.\n\nThere were 5 studies,,,,  in our subgroup analysis by ER status,
  but a population-based case-control study reported by Li et al, accounted for our
  result of an inverse association between coffee intake and the risk of ER-negative
  breast cancer. In this multivariate-adjusted Swedish study, the pooled RR of ER-negative
  breast cancer for postmenopausal women who drank more than five cups of coffee per
  day was 0.43. However, in a large cohort study reported by Ishitani et al, there
  was a significant positive association between caffeine consumption and risk of
  developing estrogen receptor-negative and progesterone receptor-negative  breast
  cancer according to hormone receptor status. Another cohort study, found no significant
  association between caffeine consumption and breast cancer risk according to hormone
  receptor status. Bageman et al, investigated the potential effect of CYP1A2 genotype
  on the relationship between coffee consumption and breast cancer risk among ER-negative
  patients. Although the CYP1A2 genotype alone did not affect breast cancer risk,
  the authors noted that, coffee consumption  combined with the CYP1A21F A/A genotype
  is associated with a greater proportion of ER tumors among patients with breast
  cancer in a population-based study. Although the results appear inconsistent, it
  could be because of the different coffee-related variables measured. For instance,
  caffeine is only one out of the many different compounds contained in coffee, and
  thus caffeine intake is perhaps not a valid substitute for measuring the total effects
  of coffee consumption. In addition, the discrepancy might be attributed to other
  factors related to coffee drinking, such as brewing method, bean type, and caffeine
  content. Concerning relative small sample size, we cannot exclude the possibility
  that our findings in some subgroups may be a result of chance. More studies are
  needed to refute or confirm the associations that we observed in some subgroups.\n\nThe
  current meta-analysis had some advantages. First, the number of total cases included
  in the meta-analysis was substantial. The pooled RRs of breast cancer for coffee
  intake were consistent with those in the previous meta-analysis which contained
  25250 cases. Second, we observed an inverse association between coffee intake and
  risk of ER-negative breast cancer. Breast cancer is characterized by genetic heterogeneity,
  encompassing different tumor types with distinct biologic features and clinical
  behaviors. So it indicated that researchers need to detail the clinical pathological
  parameters in future studies. Third, we found little evidence of publication bias
  in this meta-analysis.\n\nDespite these advantages, some limitations of our meta-analysis
  should be acknowledged. First, misclassification of coffee intake and thus misclassified
  coffee components are inevitable due to self-reported intake. Second, a meta-analysis
  is unable to solve problems with confounding factors that could be inherent in the
  included studies. Third, although many of studies had adjusted for important risk
  factors for breast cancer, unmeasured variables may also have influenced results
  of individual studies. Fourth, not all studies were included for the doseresponse
  analysis due to lack of data. Fifth, studies included in this meta-analysis were
  mostly conducted in Europe, the United States, and Asia. Therefore, additional research
  in other populations is warranted to generalize the findings. Sixth, potential publication
  bias might influence the findings, yet little evidence of publication bias was observed.
  Finally, the results of meta-analysis in some subgroups  need further to be investigated,
  because of limited data.\n\nIn conclusion, our meta-analysis suggests that coffee
  consumption is not related to overall risk of breast cancer. However, our data suggest
  that high coffee consumption may decrease risk of ERnegative breast cancer, but
  these findings may be due to chance and warrant further study.\n\nConceived and
