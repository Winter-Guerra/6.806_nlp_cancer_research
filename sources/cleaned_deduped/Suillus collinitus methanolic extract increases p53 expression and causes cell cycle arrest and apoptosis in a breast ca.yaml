  In the present work, methanolic, ethanolic and boiled water extracts of Suillus
  collinitus were chemically characterised and submitted to an evaluation of their
  bioactive properties. Phenolic acids and sugars were identified chromatographically
  and quantified in the methanolic and boiled water extracts, respectively. S. collinitus
  ethanolic extract had the highest antioxidant activity. Nevertheless, with respect
  to cell growth inhibition, the methanolic extract was the most potent extract, particularly
  in MCF-7 cells. Moreover, the GI50 concentration of this extract induced a G1 cell
  cycle arrest, with a concomitant decrease in the percentage of cells in the S phase.
  Furthermore, it caused an increase in the percentage of apoptotic cells, from 6.0
  ± 0.2% in untreated cells, to 15.3 ± 2.0% in cells treated with the GI50 concentration
  and to 16.3 ± 2.0% in cells treated with 2 × GI50 concentration. In addition, 48
  h treatment with the GI50 concentration caused a strong increase in the levels of
  p53, p21, and cleaved PARP, together with a decrease in Bcl-2 and XIAP. Results
  indicate that S. collinitus may be a promising source of bioactive compounds. Particularly,
  its methanolic extract appears to have a p53-mediated effect on the normal cell
  cycle distribution and apoptosis induction in a human breast tumor cell line.'
