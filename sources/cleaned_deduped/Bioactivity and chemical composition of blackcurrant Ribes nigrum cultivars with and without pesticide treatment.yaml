  Eleven blackcurrant cultivars grown with pesticide and without pesticide treatment
  were evaluated to compare the differences in plant growth and physical condition,
  total anthocyanin content, ascorbic acid content, total antioxidant capacity, effect
  on prostaglandin E2 production and anticancer cell proliferation activities. Results
  showed that the yield and growth of PT blackcurrants were higher. However, PF blackcurrants
  contained a higher amount of ascorbic acid, and displayed an increased inhibition
  against cancer cells compared to PT blackcurrants, indicating that PF blackcurrants
  have an increased potential to deliver health-promoting benefit for consumers. Significant
  differences were observed between blackcurrant cultivars in relation to plant growth
  and physical condition, total anthocyanin content and PGE2 assay, highlighting the
  importance of cultivar selection.'
