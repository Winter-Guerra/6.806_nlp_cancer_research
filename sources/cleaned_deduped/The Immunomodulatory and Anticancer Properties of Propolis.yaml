  Immunomodulatory and Anticancer Properties of Propolis.md
text: '


  Propolis, a waxy substance produced by the honeybee, has been adopted as a form
  of folk medicine since ancient times. It has a wide spectrum of alleged applications
  including potential anti-infection and anticancer effects. Many of the therapeutic
  effects can be attributed to its immunomodulatory functions. The composition of
  propolis can vary according to the geographic locations from where the bees obtained
  the ingredients. Two main immunopotent chemicals have been identified as caffeic
  acid phenethyl ester  and artepillin C. Propolis, CAPE, and artepillin C have been
  shown to exert summative immunosuppressive function on T lymphocyte subsets but
  paradoxically activate macrophage function. On the other hand, they also have potential
  antitumor properties by different postulated mechanisms such as suppressing cancer
  cells proliferation via its anti-inflammatory effects; decreasing the cancer stem
  cell populations; blocking specific oncogene signaling pathways; exerting antiangiogenic
  effects; and modulating the tumor microenvironment. The good bioavailability by
  the oral route and good historical safety profile makes propolis an ideal adjuvant
  agent for future immunomodulatory or anticancer regimens. However, standardized
  quality controls and good design clinical trials are essential before either propolis
  or its active ingredients can be adopted routinely in our future therapeutic armamentarium.


  Propolis is a resinous product collected by honeybees from plants, and its use as
  a folk medicine can be traced back to more than 2,000 years ago. Propolis was mainly
  used by bees for building their hives and for protection against intruders. Therefore,
  the original Greek word Propolis means defense of the city. The basic composition
  of propolis consists mainly of extracts collected from plant exudates mixed with
  the metabolites from bees. Therefore, the constituents of propolis from different
  sources also differ from each other depending on the species of the plants and flowers
  from which they are derived.


  Propolis has been adopted by a wide range of ethnic groups since ancient times.
  Egyptian used propolis to embalm cadavers; Greek and Roman physicians employed propolis
  as an antiseptic; and Incas used propolis as an antipyretic. In Chinese culture,
  propolis has been used as an anti-infection and anticancer remedy. In the modern
  era, propolis has been purported to exert antiviral, antibacterial, antifungal,
  anti-inflammatory, and hepatoprotective properties. It has been proposed that such
  diverse effects are in part due to its immunomodulating properties.


  Propolis is one of the most popular forms of alternative medicine. In 1997, the
  annual global consumption of propolis was estimated to be about 700800 tons/year.
  Propolis has been used as an ingredient for toothpaste, mouthwash, and cosmetic
  products such as face cream and lotions. Propolis is marketed in many different
  forms such as capsules, hydroalcoholic extract, creams, powder, or chewing gum and
  is available over the counter. It has also been applied as varnishing material for
  musical instruments  and as a chemical preservative for meat products.


  There have been more than 300 compounds identified from propolis so far. The compounds
  identified in propolis are mainly polyphenols. The major polyphenols found in propolis
  are flavonoids, accompanied by phenolic acid and aldehydes, phenolic aldehydes,
  ketones, etc. Other compounds are volatile oils and aromatic acids  and waxes, and
  the rest are minor miscellaneous chemicals. Some essential elements like magnesium,
  calcium, iron, nickel, and zinc as well as vitamins have also been found in propolis.
  Recently, new compounds have been isolated from propolis, such as 3,5-diprenyl-4-hydroxycinnammic
  acid  from Brazilian green propolis, and it may be one of the key immunomodulatory
  components.


  The chemical composition of propolis can be highly variable depending on the geographic
  location. For example, Brazilian propolis, which is a form of tropical propolis,
  is significantly different from propolis found in the temperate zone because of
  the differences in the vegetal sources. Furthermore, the propolis from different
  regions of Brazil still displays significant variation in their chemical compositions.
  Among the Brazilian propolis, the green propolis in southern Brazil, which has Baccharis
  dracunculifolia as its major plant source, is the most popular and well studied.
  The other famous type is the Brazilian red propolis which is collected in northern
  Brazil.


  Propolis has been found to have a wide spectrum of biological and pharmaceutical
  properties and has been demonstrated to have direct antimicrobial effects in vitro,
  without the presence of an immunological response. Aga et al. found in 1994 that
  Brazilian propolis is effective against microbes such as Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter
  erogenous, and Arthroderma benhamiae. However, some recent studies suggested that
  Brazilian green propolis also has immune-enhancing effects both in vitro and in
  vivo. Propolis has been found to exert cytotoxic effects on malignant cancer cell
  lines indirectly through activation of macrophages. Its anti-inflammatory role and
  wound healing-promoting properties have also been reported. In general, recent studies
  suggested that the immunological properties of different propolis are mostly mediated
  via direct immunosuppression and result in a decrease in the release of immunostimulatory
  cytokines. Due to the difference in study design, the exact underlying mechanisms
  of these actions remain uncertain at this time. Propolis is relatively safe for
  human use, except for inducing allergic dermatitis in some individuals.


  Variations in the biological effects of propolis obtained from different geographic
  locations have been reported and it was suggested that they have different constituents
  depending upon the plant species and the local climate and environment. We compared
  the immunological effect of propolis ethanol extracts obtained from four different
  locations, namely, Brazil, New Zealand, China, and Tasmania on resting human peripheral
  blood mononuclear cells. We studied the proliferation by using XTT colorimetric
  assay -2 H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide). This is similar to MTT assay but with a
  higher sensitivity and dynamic range. We then confirmed our findings by trypan blue
  assay. Of the four types of propolis studied, there were no significant proliferative
  effects on peripheral blood mononuclear cells, with the exception of Brazilian green
  propolis. Interestingly, we found that the modest stimulatory effect of Brazilian
  green propolis was not because of an increase in cell proliferation but rather an
  increase in cellular mitochondrial activities. The inhibitory effect of propolis
  from New Zealand, China, and Tasmania were due to their cytotoxic effect on human
  peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and all of them induced cell death in a dose-
  and time-dependent manner. These findings highlight that propolis from various origins
  have different biological effects and the use of a single biological assay can be
  misleading in the interpretation of the results.


  This unique difference between Brazilian green propolis and the other three extracts
  could be explained by the variation in their composition, since Brazilian green
  propolis is the only propolis collected from a tropical region. The similar cytotoxic
  effect of propolis from New Zealand, China, and Tasmania might be due to their similar
  chemical profile, as a previous report suggested that the constituents of propolis
  from temperate regions are more or less the same. The extraction method for the
  preparation of extract is another factor that can influence the effect of propolis.
  Therefore, future standardization of the extraction methods and appropriate selection
  of specific propolis will be vital for comparison of the results in the literature.
  In addition, whether other fractions of propolis such as the water fraction can
  exert different immune effects deserve further investigation.


  Among the large number of chemical compounds identified from propolis, caffeic acid
  phenethyl ester  is mainly found in propolis from the temperate regions but has
  only trace amounts in most tropical propolis such as Brazilian green propolis. CAPE
  is a caffeic acid derivative  and is one of the most potent bioactive ingredients
  of propolis that can be synthesized in the laboratory. The anti-inflammatory and
  antitumor properties of CAPE have been investigated by many scientists. CAPE exerts
  its antitumor effect through the inhibition of DNA synthesis ; interruption of growth
  signal transduction ; induction of apoptosis via the intrinsic apoptotic pathway
  ; and promotion of antiangiogenic effects.


  The chemical structure and physical and chemical properties of CAPE and artepillin
  C


  CAPE is a potent inhibitor of T cell receptor-mediated T cell proliferation. This
  inhibition is via suppression of both IL-2 gene transcription and IL-2 synthesis
  in stimulated T cells. CAPE inhibits the binding and DNA transcriptional activity
  of NFB and NFAT which are two key transcription factors for T cell activation. CAPE
  can also inhibit dendritic cell maturation after in vitro lipopolysaccharide  stimulation.


  Another important and specific component of propolis is artepillin C, which is a
  low-molecular-weight phenolic compound. It is uniquely found in Brazilian green
  propolis and is one of its main constituents. Artepillin C can also be synthesized
  in the laboratory. It was first isolated by a Japanese group  and was found to have
  anticancer properties. In contrast, artepillin C can protect the nontumorigenic
  liver cell line, HepG2, from oxidative damage. The bioavailability of artepillin
  C has been studied in vivo using mouse models. So far, no significant toxicity has
  been observed.


  The in vitro and in vivo antitumor effects of artepillin C on different types of
  cancer have been studied by different groups. Artepillin C can induce apoptosis
  of leukemic cells in vitro and in vivo  and it can also suppress human colonic cell
  growth by inducing G0/G1 cell cycle arrest through upregulating Cip1/p21, a cyclin-dependent
  kinase inhibitor. In addition, it blocks the PAK1 signaling so as to inhibit the
  growth of neurofibromatosis-associated tumor. Oral administration of artepillin
  C has also been reported to prevent the development of adenoma into adenocarcinoma
  in a mouse model.


  However, studies on the immunological role of artepillin C have been far less than
  that of CAPE, probably due to its lower prevalence in Brazilian green propolis alone.
  Artepillin C can indirectly kill cancer cells by increasing the T cell-mediated
  cytotoxicity by increasing the CD4/CD8 ratio and the total number of T cells in
  vivo. It can also inhibit NFB activity in macrophages so as to inhibit the exacerbation
  of carrageenan-induced paw edema in a mouse model. Artepillin C can inhibit the
  neutrophil mobilization into the inflammatory area. Therefore, artepillin C can
  serve as antiallergic agent. A summary of recent findings on the immunological properties
  of both CAPE and artepillin C are listed in Table 2.


  Peripheral blood mononuclear cells include different cell populations, mainly monocytes,
  T cells, B cells, and natural killer cells. Among these cell populations, we found
  that Brazilian green propolis mainly acted on stimulated CD14+ monocytes. The percentage
  of CD3 + CD4+ T cells was also increased; however, the effect of propolis on the
  proliferation of these cell types was quite variable. This may be due to individual
  variation depending on the existing immune status of the donors. Our findings related
  to the stimulatory effect of Brazilian green propolis on human monocytes were consistent
  with previous in vitro and in vivo studies which suggested that propolis activates
  resting macrophages, a cell type derived from monocytes. Table 3 summarized some
  of the previous findings about the effect of different propolis on macrophages.


  Brazilian green propolis exerted a stimulatory effect on CD14+ monocytes and also
  enhanced the survival of these monocytes. In our previous experiments, only a negligible
  amount of LPS was detected in our samples of Brazilian green propolis. Therefore,
  we can rule out the possibility of contamination by LPS, since it has been reported
  that LPS can stimulate monocyte proliferation and survival in vitro. Artepillin
  C, which is a major and unique component of Brazilian green propolis, does not account
  for the property of Brazilian green propolis on monocytes.


  Propolis but not artepillin C can induce monocyte and macrophage activation and
  differentiation into proinflammatory phenotypes


  The antiapoptotic effect of Brazilian green propolis raised the question as to what
  happens to monocytes after they are stimulated by Brazilian green propolis. Surprisingly,
  we found that Brazilian green propolis induced monocytes to differentiate into CD14lowHLA-DRhigh
  monocytes. The effect of Brazilian green propolis might be also due to its summative
  effects on a panel of cytokines. But this proposal remains controversial. We found
  that TNF, a monocyte-stimulating factor, was not involved in the antiapoptotic property
  of Brazilian green propolis. However, more studies are required to further delineate
  the mechanism behind the antiapoptotic effect of Brazilian green propolis on monocytes.


  Brazilian green propolis alone does not induce TNF production by monocytes. However,
  TNF production was significantly upregulated by Brazilian green propolis-primed
  monocytes after LPS stimulation. This implies that the immunomodulatory effect of
  Brazilian green propolis is indirectly induced by priming monocytes to become more
  sensitive to bacterial endotoxin challenges. Further studies are required to confirm
  whether the increase in TNF production in Brazilian green propolis-primed monocytes
  after LPS stimulation is due to the enhanced survival or differentiation of proinflammatory
  monocytes. However, the limitation of all current studies is that they have not
  been done on human subjects. There are almost no reports about which factors can
  affect the differentiation of proinflammatory monocytes in vivo. Further studies
  addressing the effect of Brazilian green propolis on proinflammatory monocyte differentiation
  might help us understand the immunomodulatory properties of Brazilian green propolis
  on monocytic lineage. It will provide us with new insights on identifying novel
  immune enhancement therapy for such diseases of severe infections or cancers.


  T cells are another major cell population of peripheral blood mononuclear cells
  and play an important role in immune defense. The immune system plays a pivotal
  role in the human bodys defense against infection. There is a delicate balance in
  the immune system so that the immune defense will not target self-antigens. However,
  a defect in such immune tolerance towards self-antigens will lead to deleterious
  autoimmune diseases. The ability for immune cells to distinguish self from nonself
  allows an individual to clear exogenous antigens. However, this self-preservation
  characteristic becomes a barrier during allogeneic bone marrow transplantations.
  Undesired recipients T cell activation can lead to graft rejection.


  The immunomodulatory effect of Brazilian green propolis in resting human peripheral
  blood mononuclear cells is mainly due to their action on CD14+ monocytes. However,
  T cells are another major component of peripheral blood mononuclear cells that may
  be affected. Surprisingly, we found that Brazilian green propolis suppressed T cell
  proliferation and activation in our mixed leukocyte reaction model. We further identified
  that artepillin C, which is reported to be a unique compound present in Brazilian
  green propolis, can be an active ingredient responsible for the immune effect of
  Brazilian green propolis on activated T cells.


  We did not observe any significant immunostimulatory effects on T cells by Brazilian
  green propolis. However, on the contrary, we found that it could suppress peripheral
  blood lymphocyte proliferation in a dose-dependent manner in our mixed leukocytes
  reaction model. This observation demonstrated the possible differential role of
  Brazilian green propolis on resting T cells and activated T cells. In addition,
  the immunosuppressive property of Brazilian green propolis on T cells suggests a
  new potential anti-inflammatory property.


  CD4+ T cell activation orchestrates the immune responses and is responsible for
  initiating T cell proliferation. By using the same mixed leukocytes reaction model,
  Brazilian green propolis was not only found to suppress the initiation of CD4 T
  cell proliferation, but could also inhibit activated T cells. The inhibitory effect
  of Brazilian green propolis on CD4 T cells was partly due to selectively inducing
  apoptosis in the proliferating T cells and not by the induction of regulatory T
  cells. However, the suppressive effect of Brazilian green propolis was reversible,
  after either restimulation by the same irradiated stimulator cells or by IL-2. T
  cell activation and cytokine production were also inhibited in the presence of Brazilian
  green propolis.


  Despite the promising results of the suppressive effect of Brazilian green propolis
  on T cells, it may be difficult to apply it clinically to patients. Propolis is
  a mixture of chemicals and their constituents vary with many different environmental
  factors such as climate and plant sources. Standardization for propolis is difficult
  even for Brazilian green propolis, which has relatively stable chemical components
  when using standard extraction protocols. In addition, the clinical outcome of using
  Brazilian green propolis as an immunosuppressant for treatment of graft versus host
  disease  remains to be shown clinically.


  On the other hand, artepillin C is uniquely found in Brazilian green propolis and
  has not been found to cause allergy. Artepillin C is also one of the active ingredients
  responsible for the immunosuppressive property of Brazilian green propolis. We measured
  its effect on peripheral blood lymphocytes and CD4 T cells using the mixed leukocytes
  reaction model. As expected, artepillin C suppressed T cell proliferation and activation
  by the same mechanisms as that of Brazilian green propolis. The major difference
  found between artepillin C and Brazilian green propolis was related to the inhibitory
  effect on cytokines produced by artepillin C which did not last as long as that
  exerted by Brazilian green propolis. The suppressive effects of artepillin C were
  mediated through direct cytotoxic effects on the early stage of responder T cell
  activation. Although we do not know whether artepillin C can activate other immune
  cells, the findings of Paulino et al. in 2008 supported ours by demonstrating that
  artepillin C suppressed macrophage activation.


  Graft versus leukemia is an important response to help eradicate leukemia after
  hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. However, this response is always inhibited
  by the immunosuppressants targeted at treating GVHD. Hence, a good immunosuppressant
  for the treatment of GVHD should be able to inhibit T cell activation and at the
  same time suppress the cancer cells. Artepillin C at concentrations that can suppress
  T cell proliferation showed a significant inhibitory effect on leukemic cell growth,
  especially for T lineage leukemia. On the other hand, it had no effect on other
  normal blood cells. Thus, we postulate that artepillin C can serve as a novel immunosuppressive
  drug for the treatment of GVHD.


  In fact, mixed leukocytes reaction has provided a functional read out for the immunosuppressive
  effect of artepillin C. The actual cellcell interaction of GVHD is extremely complicated
  in vivo. The most optimal routes of delivery and the pharmacokinetics of artepillin
  C for effective therapy remain undetermined. Further studies on the effects of artepillin
  C on T cell activation, differentiation, and effector functions in GVHD clinical
  setting is mandatory. We are currently studying a murine in vivo bone marrow transplantation
  GVHD model, and hopefully, this will verify our in vitro findings. The mechanisms
  of how artepillin C suppresses T cell expansion and function should be further explored.
  It would be interesting to explore the effect of artepillin C on T cell leukemia
  in vivo and whether or not artepillin C can reverse common leukemic drug-resistant
  mechanisms.


  After analyzing the current knowledge on the immunological effects of propolis,
  we explored another common clinical application of propolisas an anticancer therapeutic
  agent. As we elaborated in the immune effect section, we also found that some of
  the crude or fractionated propolis obtained from different countries exerted modest
  cytotoxic effects on a panel of leukemia or solid tumor cell lines. However, the
  in vitro model may not reflect the bioavailability issue correctly, and the effects
  of intermediate active chemical metabolites after liver enzymatic modifications
  may also be missed. We, therefore, reviewed the currently available in vivo data
  including results from both animal studies and human clinical trials. There is much
  more available information on the in vivo anticancer effect of propolis when compared
  to that of immune effects. Collectively, the potential anticancer effects of propolis
  can be summarized into the following possible mechanisms:  suppressing cancer/precancerous
  cells proliferation via its immunomodulatory effect;  decreasing the cancer stem
  cell populations;  blocking specific oncogene signaling pathways;  exerting antiangiogenic
  effects;  modulating the tumor microenvironment; and lastly,  as an adjunct or complementary
  treatment to existing mainstream anticancer therapies.


  Propolis has been studied as a cancer preventive medication in the setting of chronic
  skin inflammation. By using a UV-induced inflammatory hairless mouse model with
  an increased risk of photocarcinogenesis, ethanol crude extract from Australian
  propolis could minimize the skin inflammation by exerting its immunosuppressive
  effect and reducing lipid peroxidation. It could also protect against sunburn edema
  and contact hypersensitivity in a dose-dependent manner. Propolis could suppress
  the typical photoimmune response by suppressing the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6
  and IL-12 but overexpressing the immune-tolerant cytokine IL-10.


  However, for solid organ precancerous conditions, the protective effect of propolis
  remains controversial. Brazilian propolis was unable to render any hepatoprotective
  effect in rats exposed to diethylnitrosamine, a liver cancer initiation agent. However,
  studies on the effect of oral chrysin, a bioflavonoid found in propolis that has
  potent aromatase inhibitory effect on similar DEN-initiated hepatocarcinoma in a
  rat model, found that the number and size of cancer nodules formed were significantly
  reduced. This hepatoprotective effect was also reflected in the reduction of serum
  levels of liver parenchymal and ductal enzymes. Summing up these studies together,
  it is possible that propolis has a mixture of compounds and their summative effects
  do not have any hepatoprotective effect. However, the individual compound may behave
  differently from that of the mixture. We should, therefore, interpret the results
  cautiously before jumping to premature conclusions.


  In 2011, Badr et al. reported on the ability of water-soluble Egyptian propolis
  derivatives to inhibit the proliferation of Ehrlich ascites carcinoma  cells transplanted
  intraperitoneally in mice. Mice were given propolis by the enteral route through
  gastric gavaging prior to intraperitoneal injection of EAC cells. Then the mice
  were given daily propolis for 11 successive days. It was found that the volume of
  ascites fluid and the total number of EAC cells were reduced in the propolis-treated
  group. There was increased phagocytic activity and increased lymphocyte transformation
  rate and granulocytosis/monocytosis found in the mice treated with propolis suggestive
  of a possible immunostimulatory effect exerted by propolis. However, there was no
  appropriate control group in this study and it would be difficult to conclude whether
  or not the beneficial effects were derived solely from propolis administration.


  Other than using propolis to target cancer or precancerous cell populations, there
  are reports that propolis may be useful in targeting cancer stem cells. Using the
  putative breast cancer stem cells with the characteristic CD44/CD24 phenotype and
  the capability to generate mammospheres from single cells, it was found that CAPE,
  a propolis derivative, caused a dose-dependent inhibition of all three properties
  of cancer stem cells including self-renewal, progenitor formation, and clonal growth.
  The cancer stem cells population also dropped significantly.


  Our laboratory has also previously reported that Brazilian propolis that contains
  only minute amounts of CAPE could also reduce the number of putative cancer stem
  cells. Using the bioprospecting concept for novel drug discovery, we incubated a
  myeloma cell line  with crude Brazilian propolis extracts for 24 h. Half a million
  multiple myeloma cells were then incubated with Hoechst 33342 at 5 g/mL in a 37
  C water bath for 90 min and examined with flow cytometry using UV excitation to
  determine the proportion of side population, which is one way to identify putative
  cancer stem cells. Propidium iodide  was added to detect viable cells. Solvent,
  PI, and culture medium were separately used as negative controls. We found that
  propolis crude extracts used at concentrations that killed half of the myeloma populations  demonstrated
  a significant reduction in the SP of myeloma cells. The percentage of SP in the
  Brazilian propolis-treated group was decreased dramatically to 0.14 %, while the
  percentage of SP in the negative controls remained at around 17 %. The live cell
  populations in the three negative controls were similar. However, both our and Omenes
  studies were in vitro laboratory studies and further in vivo animal studies are
  needed before we can draw any definite conclusions.


  It was reported that artepillin C, a major component in Brazilian green propolis
  extract, can completely suppress the growth of human neurofibromatosis-associated
  tumor xenografts in mice through the blocking of oncogenic PAK1 signaling. Interestingly,
  a similar inhibitory effect can be induced by CAPE as well. It is known that propolis
  with CAPE are different from those with artepillin C. It was reported that using
  CAPE-rich water-miscible extract Bio-30 of New Zealand propolis  could completely
  suppress the growth of a human NF1 cancer known as malignant peripheral nerve sheath
  tumor in mice. Bio-30 also induced nearly complete regression of human NF2 tumor  in
  mice. It was noted that the poor bioavailability and water solubility of CAPE rendered
  it unusable clinically. An attempt to make CAPE soluble was done by using Bio-30
  that contained high amounts of lipids that could dissolve CAPE. The good animal
  results seen may also be due to the synergistic interactions of other propolis ingredients
  with CAPE. Interestingly, CAPE was also found to be a potential selective estrogen
  receptor modulator by its actions as a selective agonist to hERbeta, but it does
  not show any estrogenic effect on estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cells.


  Since cancer tissues require the support of both oxygen and nutrients to sustain
  rapid uncontrolled proliferation, it was interesting to find out that propolis has
  antiangiogenic effects. It was found that the ethanol extract of Brazilian propolis
  could significantly reduce the number of newly formed vessels in in vitro tube formation
  assays. Such an effect was mainly mediated through inducing apoptosis in tube-forming
  endothelial cells through the inactivation of the survival signal ERK1/2. Furthermore,
  the author demonstrated that it was the artepillin C in the propolis which accounted
  for such action.


  Another group focused on the effects of propolis and its related products on vascular
  endothelial growth factor -induced human umbilical vein endothelial cells  proliferation
  and migration. They found that, while royal jelly and Chinese red propolis suppressed
  both VEGF-induced HUVEC proliferation and migration, bee pollen and CAPE suppressed
  only proliferation. The order of suppression of VEGF-induced in vitro tube formation
  was, in descending order, CAPE &gt; Chinese red propolis &gt; bee pollen &gt; royal
  jelly. The effect of CAPE on angiogenesis was not mentioned in the previous studies,
  but it is possible that a different form of propolis was studied. It is known that
  Brazilian propolis contains more artepillin C but not CAPE.


  It has been known that the cancer microenvironment consists of stromal, endothelial,
  immune, and cancer cells. This environment is an integral part of the life cycle
  of a tumor. Clinically, intervening in the symbiosis of cancer microenvironments
  can be achieved by using thalidomide in multiple myeloma  or vincristine in leukemia.
  Interestingly, both thalidomide and vincristine are both potent immunomodulator
  and antiangiogenesis agents. They modulate the tumor microenvironment as one of
  the multidirectional activities. Other than directly inducing cancer cells apoptosis,
  they also act via their antiangiogenesis and immunomodulation effects. It was found
  that CAPE from propolis could effectively suppress the adhesion and invasion potential
  of human hepatocellular carcinoma cells  by totally abolishing the expression of
  MMP-2 and MMP-9. It was postulated that such action was related to the inhibition
  of the NFB pathway.


  Recently, a Japanese group used an array of laboratory technologies to examine various
  compounds derived from Brazilian green propolis and found that some compounds significantly
  inhibited the expression of the HIF-1 protein and HIF-1 downstream target genes
  such as glucose transporter 1, hexokinase 2, and VEGF-A. This study demonstrates
  to us that cancers and their tumor microenvironment can be tackled via novel approaches
  such as combining modern technology and knowledge of traditional herbal medicine.


  Both Western and traditional Chinese medicine treat cancers with a combination of
  agents. Therefore, it is natural to find that there is an emerging trend of research
  exploring the potential of propolis extracts as an adjunct or complementary therapy
  to mainstream anticancer chemotherapies or radiotherapies.


  A few studies investigated the additive or synergistic effects of propolis extracts
  in mainstream anticancer chemotherapies by using an in vivo murine model. Padmavathi
  et al. studied the synergistic effects of propolis ethanol extract with paclitaxel
  by using a DMBA-induced breast cancer model in the rat. They found that the group
  with combined usage of paclitaxel and propolis achieved the lowest tumor weight
  compared to those with paclitaxel alone, propolis alone, or untreated controls.


  Aside from potentiating the anticancer effect, propolis can also help to reduce
  therapy-induced toxicity of some cytotoxic agents. Water-soluble Croatian or Brazilian
  propolis extracts and related flavonoids were found to decrease irinotecan-induced
  toxic effects on normal blood, liver, and kidney cells without affecting the irinotecan
  cytotoxicity in the Ehrlich ascites tumors cell in vivo model. A similar protective
  effect of propolis can be found in tamoxifen-induced hepatotoxicity in another rat
  cancer model. Pretreatment with CAPE starting 10 days before tamoxifen injection
  significantly prevented the tamoxifen-induced liver toxicity as shown by the reduction
  in the elevation of hepatic parenchymal enzymes.


  In another in vivo murine study evaluating the rate of induced lung metastases by
  infusing transplantable mammary carcinoma cells intravenously, water-soluble Croatian
  or Brazilian propolis extracts were given either intraperitoneally or orally  in
  combination with the chemotherapeutic agent epirubicin or radiotherapy. Cancer cells
  were injected intravenously and then the numbers of metastases to the lung were
  assessed. The propolis plus chemotherapy regimen significantly reduced the lung
  metastatic rate compared to the treatment arms containing either epirubicin or propolis
  alone. Moreover, the life span in propolis-treated mice was significantly longer
  after radiotherapy with gamma rays compared to those without propolis.


  These in vivo animal studies support the use of propolis in human clinical trials
  in future precancerous or cancer scenarios. Indeed, there have been some preliminary
  human clinical trials using propolis mainly as an anti-infection agent. A Brazilian
  study investigated the efficacy of orally administered Brazilian propolis in treating
  Helicobacter pylori infection. H. pylori infection is a known predisposing factor
  for gastric cancer development. The treatment regimen used 20 drops of Brazilian
  green propolis ethanol extract three times daily for 7 days. Except for two participants
  who suffered from mild nausea and one participant who complained of epigastric pain,
  no other adverse effects were noted. There was a 20 % decline in the observed values
  of Urease Breath Test, which is a surrogate marker for intragastric bacterial load,
  in half of the 18 participants.


  The current in vitro and some preliminary in vivo data suggest that propolis has
  immunomodulatory, antitumor, and antimicrobial properties. Propolis from different
  geographic locations may have different active ingredients. Artepillin C is one
  of the major compounds uniquely found in Brazilian green propolis, and CAPE is one
  of the major components of many propolis found in the temperate zones. This wide
  spectrum of therapeutic effects makes propolis a potential candidate in several
  clinical scenarios. Propolis and its active ingredients artepillin C or CAPE have
  all been shown to have immunomodulatory effects on a wide spectrum of immune cells
  including those of lymphoid or monocytic lineages. We found that both propolis and
  artepillin C can kill leukemic cells and at the same time induce immunosuppression
  on T cells; therefore, it is an ideal compound for future clinical trials in this
  setting. Propolis and its active ingredients artepillin C and CAPE also have potential
  antitumor properties and they exert such action by different mechanisms including
  suppressing cancer cells proliferation via its immunomodulatory effects; decreasing
  the cancer stem cell populations; blocking specific oncogene signaling pathways;
  exerting antiangiogenic effects; and modulating the tumor microenvironment. The
  relatively easy administration by the oral route and good safety profile as reflected
  by its long history of usage since ancient times makes propolis an ideal adjuvant
  agent for future anticancer regimen. However, robust manufacturing processes, standardized
  quality controls, and good design clinical trials are all critical steps in verifying
  these claims.


  Propolis is still a treatment with unknown efficacy and safety for many diseases.
  While it has been extensively studied in cancer, potential uses may include treatment
  of immunological diseases such as allergy, asthma, or atopic dermatitis, as indicated
  by its immune effects. Herbal medications  and dietary manipulation and supplements  have
  been used for centuries for the treatment of autoimmune and allergic diseases and
  are now just beginning to be studied in a scientific manner. Along with propolis,
  many of these therapies may be used more prominently as more information about their
  components and mechanism of action is elucidated.
