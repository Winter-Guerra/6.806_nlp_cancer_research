  Consumption and Breast Cancer Risk in Puerto Rico The Atabey Study.md
text: '


  Objective: There is evidence that lignans, high in phytoestrogens, are associated
  with decreased breast cancer  risk. We assessed dietary intake of legumes around
  the time of menarche  and in adulthood  in relation to risk in a Puerto Rican  population
  with high intake of legumes. Methods: In the Atabey Study, a population based, case-control
  study of women 30-79y residing in the San Juan, PR, Metropolitan Area, we conducted
  in-person interviews among 317 cases and 348 controls, including assessment of dietary
  intake of legumes, using a culturally-specific, semi-quantitative food frequency
  questionnaire.  Results: Intake of legumes was not significantly associated with
  breast cancer risk. For adult intakes, there was a non-significant increase in risk
  for lower legume consumption  for the lowest tertile compared to the highest tertile.
  Results were similar for analyses of adult intakes stratified on menopausal status.
  For reported adolescent legume intake, the adjusted OR  was 1.24  for intake below
  the median compared to above. Conclusion: Higher legume intake during adulthood
  or at 12-13y old was not significantly associated with BrCa risk in this population
  with high legume intake. Further analyses are needed to better describe potential
  roles of fiber, total lignan and other food components in relation to BrCa prevention
  in this Hispanic population. Funded in part by DOD CDMRP, BC060131 '
