  protects against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity in vivo and in vitro.md
text: '


  The long-term clinical usefulness of doxorubicin, an anthracycline with potent antitumor
  activity, is limited by DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. Kaempferol, one of the most
  common dietary flavonoids, is known to have anti-apoptotic, anti-oxidative, and
  anti-inflammatory properties. The current study aimed to investigate the possible
  protective effect of kaempferol against DOX-induced cardiotoxicity and the underlying
  mechanisms. Rats were intraperitoneally  treated with DOX  every other day for a
  cumulative dose of 9 mg/kg. After 28 days, DOX caused retarded body and heart growth,
  oxidative stress, apoptotic damage, mitochondrial dysfunction, and Bcl-2 expression
  disturbance. In contrast, kaempferol pretreatment  attenuated the DOX-induced apoptotic
  damage in heart tissues. In vitro studies also indicated that kaempferol may have
  used the mitochondrion-dependent pathway to counteract the DOX-induced cardiotoxicity.
  This counteraction was achieved by inhibiting p53 expression and its binding to
  the promoter region of the Bax proapoptotic gene, but not to the Bcl-2 antiapoptotic
  gene. Kaempferol also effectively suppressed DOX-induced extracellular signal-regulated
  kinase  1/2 activation, but had no effect on p38 and JNK. Therefore, kaempferol
  protected against DOX-induced cardiotoxicity, at least, partially, by inhibiting
  the activation of p53-mediated, mitochondrion-dependent apoptotic signaling, and
  by being involved in an ERK-dependent mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway.
  These findings elucidated the potential of kaempferol as a promising reagent for
  treating DOX-induced cardiotoxicity, and may have implications in the long-term
  clinical usefulness of DOX.'
