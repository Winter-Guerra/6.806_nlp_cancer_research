  of trans fatty acids from partially hydrogenated vegetable and fish oils and ruminant
  fat in relation to cancer r.md
text: "\n\nIntake of trans fatty acids  may influence systemic inflammation, insulin
  resistance and adiposity, but whether TFA intake influences cancer risk is insufficiently
  studied. We examined the association between TFA intake from partially hydrogenated
  vegetable oils, partially hydrogenated fish oils, and ruminant fat  and cancer risk
  in the Norwegian counties study, a large cohort study with a participation rate
  &gt;80%. TFA intake was assessed three times in 1974-1988 by questionnaire. A total
  of 77,568 men and women were followed up through 2007, during which time 12,004
  cancer cases occurred. Hazard ratios  and confidence intervals  were estimated with
  Cox regression for cancer sites with 150 cases during follow-up. Significantly increased
  or decreased risks were found when comparing the highest and lowest intake categories
  \ for PHVO-TFA and pancreatic cancer in men  and non-Hodgkin lymphoma  in both genders
  ; PHFO-TFA and rectal cancer, prostate cancer, and multiple myeloma ; and rTFA and
  all cancers, cancer of the mouth/pharynx, NHL  and multiple myeloma. Furthermore,
  positive trends were found for PHFO-TFA and stomach cancer  and rTFA and postmenopausal
  breast cancer. Inverse trends were found for PHVO-TFA and all cancers  and cancer
  of the central nervous system in women. PHFO-TFA, but not PHVO-TFA, seemed to increase
  cancer risk. The increased risks observed for rTFA may be linked to saturated fat.\n\nObservational
  studies and randomized trials have found that intake of trans fatty acids  has unfavorable
  effects on multiple risk factors for cardiovascular diseases, including blood lipids,
  lipoproteins and endothelial function.1 For this reason the association between
  TFA intake and cardiovascular disease risk has been extensively studied.2 TFA intake
  may also influence factors related to cancer risk such as systemic inflammation,
  insulin resistance, and adiposity,1, 3 but the association between TFA intake and
  cancer risk has not been sufficiently studied.4 A few studies on colon/colorectal,
  breast and prostate cancer have rendered inconclusive results,5, 6 and the number
  of studies on other cancer sites is limited.\n\nDietary TFA derive from three main
  sources; partially hydrogenated vegetable oils, partially hydrogenated fish oils,
  and ruminant fat. TFA from PHVO  and PHFO  are industrially produced and used in
  the production of margarines and fats used for baking and deep frying. Intake of
  PHFO-TFA was high in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Germany, Eastern Europe
  and Norway.7 TFA from ruminant fat  occur naturally in small amounts in dairy products
  and meat from ruminant animals. TFA from these three sources differ in terms of
  carbon chain length, position, and number of trans bonds. Thus, the health effects
  may also be different.8, 9 Most previous studies on TFA intake and cancer risk have
  not distinguished between different sources of TFA, and to our knowledge, no previous
  study has specifically evaluated the effect of PHFO-TFA on cancer risk.\n\nThe Norwegian
  counties study is a large population-based cohort study of both men and women. The
  study has a very high participation rate, repeated exposure assessment, including
  detailed information on TFA intake from different sources,7 and 30 years of complete
  follow-up. This gives us the unique possibility to investigate the associations
  between PHVO-TFA, PHFO-TFA and rTFA intake and the risk of several cancers.\n\nBMI:

  Norwegian Counties Study was carried out between 1974 and 1988 in the three counties
  in Norway: Finnmark, Oppland and Sogn og Fjordane. The study consisted of three
  health screenings, which were conducted every 5 years in Oppland and Sogn og Fjordane,
  whereas in Finnmark, screenings II and III were carried out 3 and 13 years, respectively,
  after screening I. In all three counties, residents aged 35-49 years, and a random
  sample aged 20-34 years were invited to screening I, in total 34,115 men and 31,509
  women.10 All residents were reinvited to screening II if they had been invited to
  screening I. Previously invited residents were also reinvited to screening III,
  except that among residents of Oppland and Sogn og Fjordane aged 55 years or older
  only a random sample was reinvited. In addition, samples of younger residents not
  previously invited were invited to screening II  and screening III. The attendance
  rate was 88% at screenings I and II, and 84% at screening III. In total, 92,234
  persons attended at least one health screening.\n\nAt each health screening, a team
  of specially trained nurses examined and interviewed the participants. Height, weight
  and blood pressure were measured, and a nonfasting blood sample was collected and
  analyzed for triglycerides and total cholesterol. Information on smoking habits
  and recreational and occupational physical activity was obtained by questionnaire.
  During the interview, the questionnaire was checked for inconsistencies, and women
  were asked about menopausal status. The participants education level was obtained
  from Statistics Norway.7\n\nThe present study was approved by the Norwegian Data
  Inspectorate and the Regional Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics,
  Southeast Norway.\n\nA semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire  was handed
  out at screenings II and III. As it was not distributed in all municipalities, only
  59% of the participants received the FFQ at screening I. A detailed description
  of the FFQ, its reproducibility and validity has been published elsewhere.11 The
  FFQ was primarily designed to detect the main sources of fat in the Norwegian diet
  and included 80 food items.\n\nThe nutrient composition of the food items in the
  FFQ was obtained from the Norwegian food composition table most relevant for the
  period of data collection. Food items that contributed to the calculation of nutrient
  intake included bread, fats on bread, spreads, cheese, milk, cakes, eggs, meat and
  fish dishes, potatoes and cod liver oil supplement. Standard portion sizes were
  used for most of the food items. TFA intake was calculated using the fatty acid
  composition of the food items, margarines and fats used by the baking industry at
  the time of the screenings. During the study period, PHVO was derived from soybean
  oil and PHFO from different fish oils. A more detailed description of the production
  procedures have been published previously.7 We calculated PHFO-TFA intake and PHVO-TFA
  intake based on the amount consumed of baking fat and different types of margarine.
  Food items that contributed to intake of baking fat were store-brought bread and
  cake. Margarine intake included margarine used on bread, for frying fish, and on
  meat and fish dishes. We did not have information on deep-fried food items or snacks
  that may contain industrial TFA. However, these foods represented only a small proportion
  of industrial TFA intake.12 Calculation of rTFA intake was based on consumption
  of dairy products and ruminant meat products. If more than 10 questions on any FFQ
  were unanswered, we did not calculate that participants nutrient intake for the
  corresponding health screening. Of participants who received the FFQ, nutrient intakes
  were estimated for 93% at screening I, 82% at screening II, and 84% at screening
  III. At each health screening, we eliminated nutrient intakes if the ratio of energy
  intake to basal metabolic rate13 was in the screening-specific top and bottom 1%,
  leaving 79,227 participants with nutrient intakes from at least one screening.\n\nInformation
  on cancer incidence, and death or emigration was obtained through linkages to the
  Cancer Registry of Norway and Statistics Norway, using the unique identification
  number assigned to all Norwegian citizens. The Cancer Registry of Norway was used
  to obtain information on cancer site and histology.\n\nThe baseline screening represented
  the start of follow-up, and was defined as the first health screening a participant
  attended when  they were aged 18 years or above,  fat intake could be estimated,
  \ questions about smoking and physical activity were answered, and  weight and height
  were measured. We excluded participants whose screenings did not fulfill the criteria
  for a baseline screening, as well as those without information on education level,
  those who emigrated or were diagnosed with cancer before start of follow up, and
  participants who died, emigrated, or were diagnosed with cancer during the first
  year of follow-up. After these exclusions, 77,568 participants  were included in
  the analyses. Of these, 37,439 had one measurement of TFA intake, 24,095 had two
  measurements and 16,034 had three measurements.\n\nParticipants were then followed
  up until the date of cancer diagnosis, death, emigration or December 31, 2007, whichever
  occurred first. Participants with cancer at multiple sites with the same date of
  diagnosis were included as events in analyses of all cancers, but were censored
  at diagnosis in site-specific analyses. Cancers were categorized using the international
  classification of diseases, tenth edition, as in Cancer in Norway.14 In the present
  study we considered only cancer sites with 150 events or more during follow-up.
  Breast cancers were defined as premenopausal if at the date of diagnosis, menopause
  had not yet been reported at a health screening, and the woman was younger than
  55 years of age; otherwise they were defined as postmenopausal breast cancers.15
  Histological grade was available for 920  prostate cancers, which were classified
  as low-grade  or high-grade. For all the sites we studied, &gt;90% of the cancer
  cases were morphologically verified, except pancreas and central nervous system,
  for which 86.9 and 78.9% of cases, respectively, were morphologically verified.
  \ \n\nTFA intake was measured as percent of energy intake. At each health screening,
  TFA intake was classified into five categories: ; 0.15, 0.15-0.649, 0.65-1.149,
  1.15-1.649 or  1.65 E% for PHVO-TFA; &lt; 0.85, 0.85-1.349, 1.35-1.849, 1.85-2.349
  or  2.35 E% for PHFO-TFA and &lt; 0.4, 0.4-0.549, 0.55-0.699, 0.7-0.849 or  0.85
  E% for rTFA. These categories were chosen to establish intake cut-off points at
  regular intervals and to define categories with a sufficient number of events. We
  did not use percentiles to define intake categories because of the changes in intake
  that occurred between health screenings. Level of physical activity was classified
  as sedentary, moderately active or active at each health screening by combining
  the categories of occupational and recreational physical activity.16 Participants
  were classified as never, former or current smokers, and were classified as former
  instead of never-smokers at a given screening if they had been previously classified
  as former or current smoker. Education level was categorized as primary schooling,
  secondary education  or university level education, according to the most recent
  information available from Statistics Norway.\n\nHazard ratios  and 95% confidence
  intervals  for the association between TFA intake and cancer risk were estimated
  with Cox regression. We used a stratified Cox model with year of birth in 5-year
  intervals as the strata  and attained age as the time variable. All analyses were
  adjusted for gender, except analyses of breast, cervical, endometrial and ovarian
  cancer, in which only women were included; and analyses of prostate cancer, in which
  only men were included. The model also included energy intake, level of physical
  activity, smoking, body mass index, and education level. These covariates are established
  risk factors for cancer. All variables, except gender and education level, were
  modeled as time-dependent. Values for participants were updated at each subsequent
  screening that fulfilled the same criteria as the baseline screening. For TFA and
  energy intake, we used the mean of intakes from all preceding attended screenings
  since start of follow-up.7, 17 For level of physical activity, smoking, and BMI,
  we used values from the most recent preceding attended screening.7 For cancers of
  the breast, cervix, endometrium and ovary, additional adjustment for age at first
  birth  did not change the results, and this was not included in the final model.
  In analyses of premenopausal breast cancer, women were censored at onset of menopause.
  In analyses of postmenopausal breast cancer, onset of menopause was considered the
  start of follow-up. Analyses of prostate cancer included cases without information
  on histological grade, but these were censored at diagnosis in analyses of low-grade
  and high-grade prostate cancer. For cancers of the mouth and pharynx, pancreas and
  lung, for which smoking is an important risk factor, we performed subanalyses restricted
  to never-smokers to explore residual confounding due to potentially insufficient
  adjustment for smoking. We also performed additional analyses including only morphologically
  verified cancer cases of the pancreas and central nervous system. The results were
  similar to the results for morphologically verified and unverified cases combined
  and are therefore not presented.\n\nTo test for linear trends, TFA intake was modeled
  continuously. We tested for interaction between TFA intake and gender. For the events
  where the interaction test was significant, interaction terms between intake and
  gender were added to the model. We also tested for interaction between TFA intake
  and follow-up time. Because the interaction test lacks power,18 it was done only
  for events with at least 150 cases in each follow-up time period, namely all cancers,
  colon, rectal, lung, cutaneous malignant melanoma, postmenopausal breast, endometrial
  and prostate cancers. We used a likelihood ratio test to test for interaction, with
  TFA intake modeled continuously. Linear trend was tested with a likelihood ratio
  test in models without interaction and a Wald test in models with interaction between
  TFA intake and gender.\n\nAll tests were two-sided and p &lt; 0.05 was considered
  statistically significant. The analyses were performed using SAS version 9.2.\n\nA
  total of 12,004 men and women were diagnosed with cancer during a mean follow-up
  of 24.8 years.\n\nBaseline mean PHVO-TFA intake was 0.9 E%. In the highest intake
  category, 70.5% were men. PHVO-TFA intake was inversely related to rTFA intake and
  positively related to polyunsaturated cis fatty acid intake. The Spearman correlation
  coefficient between PHVO-TFA intake and polyunsaturated cis fatty acid intake was
  0.65. The proportion of current smokers was highest in the highest PHVO-TFA intake
  category.  \n\nFor PHVO-TFA, we found significant, inverse trends for all cancers,
  pancreatic cancer in men, CMM in men, nonmelanoma skin cancer, cancer of the CNS
  in women  and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Significantly decreased risks in the highest
  compared to the lowest intake category were observed only for pancreatic cancer
  and NHL. Moreover, for CMM and nonmelanoma skin cancer, we did not find significantly
  decreased risks in any intake category, and in fact men in intake category 2  were
  at significantly increased risk of CMM. We found significant interactions between
  PHVO-TFA intake and gender for pancreatic cancer, CMM  and cancer of the CNS. Results
  for low-grade and high-grade prostate cancer  were similar to results for all prostate
  cancers. For cancers of the mouth and pharynx, pancreas and lung, results for never-smokers
  were similar to results for all participants, but the inverse association found
  for pancreatic cancers in men was no longer significant. The associations between
  intake and cancer risk did not differ by follow-up time.  \n\nBaseline PHFO-TFA
  intake was considerably higher than PHVO-TFA intake, mean 1.6 E%. In the lowest
  intake category, 64.4% were men. The lowest proportion of participants with university
  level education was found in the highest intake category. With increasing PHFO-TFA
  intake, PHVO-TFA and rTFA intakes decreased, total fat intake increased and monounsaturated
  cis fatty acid and carbohydrate intake decreased. Total serum cholesterol increased
  with increasing PHFO-TFA intake. The proportion of current smokers was highest in
  the lowest intake category.\n\nSignificant positive trends were found for stomach
  cancer  and multiple myeloma. Furthermore, participants in all intake categories
  except category 4  were at significantly increased risk of rectal cancer compared
  to participants in the lowest intake category. Participants in the highest intake
  category were also at increased risk of pancreatic cancer, but this was not significant.
  Significant inverse trends were found for lung cancer in women  and prostate cancer.
  Moreover, inverse associations were found in analyses of both low-grade and high-grade
  prostate cancer, but the association was significant for low-grade prostate cancer
  only.  \n\nWe found a significant interaction between PHFO-TFA intake and gender
  for lung cancer only. No significant interactions were found between PHFO-TFA intake
  and follow-up time, except for all cancers, in which HRs per 0.5 E% increase in
  intake were 1.02  for follow-up &lt; 10 years after last measurement and 0.99  for
  follow-up  10 years after last measurement of nutrient intake. When restricting
  the analyses of lung cancer to never-smokers, we found a significant, positive association
  between PHFO-TFA intake and risk in men  and a weak, nonsignificant, positive association
  in women. For cancers of the mouth and pharynx and pancreas, results in never-smokers
  were similar to results in all participants.\n\nBaseline mean intake of rTFA was
  0.6 E%, considerably lower than PHVO-TFA and PHFO-TFA intake. The proportion of
  participants with university level education decreased with increasing rTFA intake.
  rTFA intake was inversely related to both PHVO-TFA and PHFO-TFA intake. Furthermore,
  rTFA intake was positively related to total fat, saturated fat and monounsaturated
  cis fatty acid intakes; and inversely related to polyunsaturated cis fatty acid
  intake. The Spearman correlation coefficient between rTFA and saturated fat intakes
  was 0.86. Mean total serum cholesterol and serum triglycerides were highest in the
  highest rTFA intake category. The proportion of current smokers increased, while
  the proportion of sedentary participants decreased with increasing rTFA intake.\n\nWe
  found significant, positive trends for all cancers,, cancer of the mouth and pharynx,
  nonmelanoma skin cancer, postmenopausal breast cancer  and NHL, with a significantly
  increased risk in the highest compared to the lowest intake category, except for
  postmenopausal breast cancer, for which we found a significantly increased risk
  in intake category 3, but not in the highest intake category. We also found an indication
  of a positive trend for cancer of the CNS. Significant inverse trends were found
  for multiple myeloma  and for CMM in women, but risk was significantly lower in
  the highest compared to the lowest intake category only for multiple myeloma. Intake
  was not associated with either low-grade or high-grade prostate cancer. Significant
  interaction between rTFA intake and gender was only found for CMM. Furthermore,
  significant interactions between intake and follow-up were observed for all cancers
  \ and CMM. For all cancers, HRs and 95% CIs per 0.5 E% increase were 0.96  for follow-up
  &lt; 10 years and 1.10  for follow-up  10 years after last measurement of nutrient
  intake. For CMM, corresponding HRs and 95% CIs were 0.89  and 1.39  for men, and
  0.53  and 0.82  for women. Intake of rTFA was associated with increased risk of
  cancer of the mouth and pharynx in never-smokers also, but not significantly. We
  found no association between rTFA intake and risk of cancers of the pancreas and
  lung in never-smokers.  \n\nTFA from different sources showed different associations
  with cancer risk. More unfavorable risks were found for PHFO-TFA and rTFA intake
  than for PHVO-TFA intake. For PHFO-TFA, we observed significant positive trends
  for stomach cancer and multiple myeloma, with significantly increased risk of multiple
  myeloma in the highest compared to lowest intake category. Furthermore, we found
  significantly increased risk of rectal cancer in the highest compared to lowest
  intake category. Significant inverse trends were observed for prostate cancer and
  lung cancer in women. However, for lung cancer, we found a significant positive
  association in men and a nonsignificant positive association in women when restricting
  the analysis to never-smokers. For PHVO-TFA, we observed significant inverse trends
  for all cancers, pancreatic cancer in men, CMM in men, nonmelanoma skin cancer,
  cancer of the CNS in women and NHL, with significantly decreased risks in the highest
  compared to the lowest intake category for pancreatic cancer and NHL. For rTFA,
  we found significant positive trends with increased risks in the highest compared
  to the lowest intake category for all cancers, cancer of the mouth and pharynx,
  nonmelanoma skin cancer and NHL. Furthermore, we found a significant positive trend
  for postmenopausal breast cancer. Significant inverse trends were found for multiple
  myeloma and for CMM in women, with significantly decreased risk in the highest compared
  to the lowest intake category for multiple myeloma.\n\nTo our knowledge, no previous
  studies have evaluated the effect of TFA from different sources on cancer risk.
  The different associations between cancer risk and TFA from the three sources in
  this report may be related to the different chemical structures of each TFA, which
  may lead to a different site-specific carcinogenic effect. rTFA and PHVO-TFA contain
  isomers with 18 carbon atoms and almost exclusively trans monoenes. The spectra
  of isomers are, however, quite different. The main isomer in PHVO is elaidic acid
  \ while in ruminant fat it is trans vaccenic acid  in addition to conjugated linoleic
  acid. PHFO-TFA is a complex mixture of fatty acids of different chain lengths, mainly
  varying between 14 and 24 carbon atoms, with different number of trans bonds and
  with different locations in the molecule. It is conceivable that such different
  chemical structures have different metabolic effects.\n\nWe found no associations
  between PHVO-TFA intake and premenopausal or postmenopausal breast cancer risk or
  prostate cancer risk. A few nested case-control studies have examined the effects
  of elaidic acid on breast and prostate cancer risk using biomarkers to assess TFA.
  The studies on breast cancer are in accordance with our results, indicating no association
  between elaidic acid and either premenopausal19 or postmenopausal breast cancer
  risk.19-22 In contrast to our results on prostate cancer, elaidic acid was associated
  with a significantly increased risk of nonaggressive and total prostate cancer in
  one study,23 while another study found a nonsignificant positive association between
  elaidic acid and overall prostate cancer risk.24\n\nWe observed inverse associations
  between PHVO-TFA intake and risk of pancreatic cancer in men, cancer of the CNS
  in women, NHL and all cancers. Total TFA intake, assessed by FFQ, was not associated
  with pancreatic cancer risk in three prospective studies,25-27 but a nonsignificant
  positive association was found in one case-control study.28 Two studies, both using
  FFQ, examined the association between total TFA intake and NHL risk and found positive
  associations, but they were significant in only one of the studies.28, 29 None of
  the previous studies on pancreatic cancer and NHL have differentiated between sources
  of TFA, and their results are therefore not directly comparable with ours. Until
  1997 in Norway, PHVO was used in vegetable oil-based soft margarines, which have
  a high content of cis monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids. We observed
  a positive association between PHVO-TFA intake and polyunsaturated cis fatty acid
  intake. Polyunsaturated fatty acid intake has been associated with significantly
  reduced NHL risk in previous studies,30, 31 but not with reduced pancreatic cancer
  risk.25-27\n\nWe found no association between TFA intakes and risk of either colon
  or rectal cancer. The results from previous studies on colon or colorectal cancer
  are inconsistent. A few case-control studies have found positive associations between
  total TFA intake and risk of colon28, 32 or colorectal cancer,33-35 but some of
  these positive associations were limited to subgroups of participants.32-35 Two
  case-control studies36, 37 and three cohort studies38-40 found no association between
  total TFA intake and risk of colon or colorectal cancer. The relation between risk
  colorectal cancer and specific TFA or TFA from specific sources has not been studied
  previously.\n\nTo our knowledge, no previous studies have examined PHFO-TFA intake
  alone in relation to cancer risk. We found an inverse association between PHFO-TFA
  intake and lung cancer risk in women. The proportion of current smokers was highest
  in the lowest category of PHFO-TFA intake, and a possible explanation could be that
  our adjustment for smoking was insufficient when studying lung cancer. In never-smokers,
  we found a significant, positive association between PHFO-TFA intake and lung cancer
  risk in men and a positive, nonsignificant association in women. Thus, a protective
  effect of PHFO-TFA intake on lung cancer risk seems unlikely. A previous case-control
  study reported no association between total TFA intake and lung cancer risk.28\n\nWe
  found inverse associations between PHFO-TFA intake and prostate cancer risk that
  was significant for low-grade, but not for high-grade prostate cancer. Previous
  findings on TFA intake and prostate cancer are conflicting and illustrate the complexity
  of the matter. Brasky et al. reported that serum levels of 18:1 TFA and 18:2 TFA
  were associated with significantly decreased risk of high-grade prostate cancer,
  but not low-grade prostate cancer.41 In contrast, Chavarro et al. found no association
  between serum levels of TFA and risk of aggressive prostate cancer, but 18:1 TFA
  and 18:2 TFA were associated with a significantly increased risk of non-aggressive
  prostate cancer.23 A study where low-grade prostate cancers were excluded found
  no association for either 16:1 TFA, 18:1 TFA or 18:2 n-6 TFA.42 A Dutch study found
  no association between total TFA intake and risk of either localized or advanced
  prostate cancer.43 Moreover, one study found that the association between TFA and
  prostate cancer risk was modified by a genetic polymorphism.44 We did not have information
  about family history or genetic polymorphisms in the present study.\n\nFor rTFA,
  we found no associations with premenopausal breast cancer or prostate cancer risk,
  but a significant, positive association with postmenopausal breast cancer risk.
  Trans vaccenic acid has been reported to be associated with a non-significant increased
  risk of premenopausal breast cancer45 and with both significantly increased45, 46
  and decreased risk47 of postmenopausal breast cancer. One study examined trans vaccenic
  acid and prostate cancer risk, and found a significant, positive association.24
  Trans vaccenic acid can be desaturated to C18:2 cis-9, trans-11 conjugated linoleic
  acid  in humans.48 Also, preformed CLA is found in small amounts in ruminant fat.
  Animal models have suggested that CLA may have anticancer properties.48 However,
  results from epidemiological studies in humans on CLA and cancer risk are inconsistent.
  A significant inverse association was found in one study on colorectal cancer49
  and one study on breast cancer.47 Other studies on breast cancer have found no association45,
  50, 51 or a significant, positive association.46\n\nIntakes of rTFA and saturated
  fat will always be highly correlated because the sources of rTFA are also important
  sources of saturated fat. In the present study, the Spearman correlation coefficient
  between these two intakes at baseline screening was 0.86. Because of the high correlation,
  we could not include saturated fat and rTFA intakes in the same model, as it would
  have caused serious colinearity problems, making the results impossible to interpret.
  Because we cannot distinguish between the effects of rTFA and saturated fat, it
  is possible that the positive associations observed between rTFA intake and cancer
  risk are caused by saturated fat, and not rTFA.\n\nWe found significant trends for
  PHVO-TFA intake and risk of CMM and nonmelanoma skin cancer, but the results from
  categorical analyses were not consistent with these trend tests. Moreover, rTFA
  intake was significantly inversely associated with CMM risk and positively associated
  with nonmelanoma skin cancer risk. However, this cohort is not ideal for studying
  risk factors for skin cancer, as we lack information on ultraviolet exposure, the
  main risk factor for skin cancer and residual confounding may be a problem.52 We
  are not aware of any other studies on skin cancer and TFA intake.\n\nThe mechanisms
  by which TFA may produce carcinogenic effects are poorly understood.1 However, TFA
  intake may promote chronic low-grade inflammation, a risk factor for the development
  of several cancers.4 Positive associations between TFA intake and biomarkers of
  inflammation have been found in both clinical trials53, 54 and observational studies.55,
  56 Furthermore, fatty acids may exert immunomodulatory effects on immune cells.57,
  58 A possible link between fatty acids, inflammation and immunity are the eicosanoids,
  which are generated from polyunsaturated fatty acids with 20 carbon atoms57 and
  are involved in both inflammatory and immune responses. PHFO contain a complex mixture
  of modified, very long-chain fatty acids, in addition to trans monoenes, trans dienes
  and trans trienes.59 It is thus likely that PHFO-TFA intake results in adversely
  modified eicosanoids that have adverse effects on inflammatory and immune responses.
  This may explain why we observed positive associations between cancer risk and PHFO-TFA
  intake, but not PHVO-TFA intake.\n\nStrengths of our study include the prospective
  design, participation rates above 80%, and practically complete follow-up through
  linkage with high-quality national registries. Indeed, reporting of definite malignant
  neoplasms to the Cancer Registry of Norway is required by law, and for the period
  2001-2005, the overall completeness of the Norwegian Cancer Registry was 98.84%.60
  For the sites included in the present report, completeness ranges from 93.81% for
  cancers of the CNS to 99.98% for endometrial cancer.60 Even though most of our cases
  were morphologically verified, we cannot rule out the possibility that some cancer
  cases may have been misclassified. The proportion of cases that was verified was
  somewhat lower for cancers of the pancreas and CNS than for the other sites. However,
  limiting the analyses of these cancers to verified cases gave similar results, thus
  misclassification does not seem to have influenced the results. Furthermore, the
  FFQ was designed specifically to measure fat intake in the Norwegian diet, and we
  have accurate information from the margarine industry on the compositions of the
  different types of margarine that were produced at the time the screenings took
  place. Intake of industrially produced TFA has decreased substantially in Norway,
  and because we have up to three measurements of intake for each participant, we
  have been able to take at least some of the changes that have occurred into account.
  Although intake was not measured after 1988, it does not seem to have influenced
  the results. Indeed, the associations between PHVO-TFA intake and cancer risk did
  not differ by follow-up time, and for PHFO-TFA intake the associations did not differ
  for any individual cancer site, but did differ for all cancers combined. Measurement
  error in the exposure variables is inevitable in epidemiological studies on diet
  and cancer. Intakes of fat and energy measured with the FFQ have been compared to
  a 24-hr recall interview in a sample of participants,11 but a limitation of our
  study is that this was not done for TFA intake. Moreover, we have not measured biomarkers
  of TFA intake. Another limitation is that for some sites we have not been able to
  control for important potential confounding variables, e.g., alcohol intake for
  cancer of the mouth and pharynx and ultraviolet exposure for CMM and nonmelanoma
  skin cancer.\n\nBecause we have studied several end points and three different exposures,
  we have performed a large number of statistical tests. Even if all our null hypotheses
  are true, i.e., there is no association between TFA intake and risk of any cancer,
  we would expect to wrongly reject the null hypothesis for one in twenty tests. In
  conclusion, our results indicate that PHFO-TFA have more adverse effects on cancer
  risk than PHVO-TFA. The high correlation between rTFA and saturated fat raises the
  possibility that the increased risk observed for rTFA is linked to saturated fat.\n\nThe
