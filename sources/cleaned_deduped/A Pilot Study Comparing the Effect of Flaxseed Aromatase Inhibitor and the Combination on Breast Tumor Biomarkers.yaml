  Use of complementary approaches is common among breast cancer survivors. Potential
  interactions between aromatase inhibitors and high phytoestrogen foods, such as
  flaxseed, are not often described. We conducted a pilot 2 × 2 factorial, randomized
  intervention study between tumor biopsy and resection, in 24 postmenopausal women
  with estrogen receptor positive breast cancer, to assess the effects of FS and anastrozole,
  and possible interactions between them, on serum steroid hormone and tumor-related
  characteristics associated with long-term survival. The effect of each treatment
  vs. placebo on outcomes was determined by linear regression adjusting for pretreatment
  measure, stage, and grade. Although not statistically significant, mean ERβ expression
  was approximately 40% lower from pre- to postintervention in the FS + AI group only.
  We observed a statistically significant negative association for androstenedione
  in the FS + AI group vs. placebo and for DHEA with AI treatment. Enterolactone excretion
  was much lower in the FS + AI group compared to the FS group. Our results do not
  support strong effects of FS on AI activity for selected breast tumor characteristics
  or serum steroid hormone levels but suggest AI therapy might reduce the production
  of circulating mammalian lignans from FS.'
