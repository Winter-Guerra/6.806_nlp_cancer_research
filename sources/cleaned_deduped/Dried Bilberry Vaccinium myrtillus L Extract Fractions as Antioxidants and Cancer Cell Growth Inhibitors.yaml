  Three antioxidant fractions were separated by solid phase extraction from dried
  bilberry and tested for antioxidant and antiproliferative activity. Vitamin C was
  identified in Fr1, six flavonoids in Fr2 and eight phenolic acids in Fr3. The most
  abundant compounds in Fr2 and Fr3 were quercetin and p-  coumaric acid, respectively.
  The best free radical scavenging activity on hydroxyl radicals was expressed by
  Fr3, and on 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrihydrazyl radicals by Fr2. Considering the kinetic
  behaviour, tested by spectrophotometrical DPPH method, the highest antiradical efficiency
  was demonstrated by Fr2. Fr2 and Fr3 significantly inhibited the growth of cervix
  epitheloid carcinoma, breast adenocarcinoma and colon adenocarcinoma cell lines,
  with IC50 ranging from 125.80 to 300.48 Î¼g/ml. Dried bilberry possesses beneficial
  effects in prevention of cancer and diseases which have been attributed to free
  radical production.'
