  Grapes are rich in phytochemicals with many proven health benefits. Phenolic profiles,
  antioxidant and antiproliferative activities of twenty-four selected Vitis vinifera
  grape cultivars were investigated in this study. Large ranges of variation were
  found in these cultivars for the contents of total phenolics and flavonoids and
  antioxidant activities, cellular antioxidant activities and antiproliferative activities.The
  total antioxidant activities were significantly correlated with the total phenolics
  and flavonoids. However, no significant correlations were found between antiproliferative
  activities and total phenolics or total flavonoids content. Wine grapes and color
  grapes showed much higher levels of phytochemicals and antioxidant activities than
  table grapes and green/yellow grapes. Several germplasm accessions with much high
  contents of phenolics and flavonoids, and total antioxidant activity were identified.
  These germplasm can be valuable sources of genes for breeding grape cultivars with
  better nutritional qualities of wine and table grapes in the future.

  Fruits, as an important part of diet, are beneficial for human health.The Dietary
  Guidelines for Americans provide three reasons to eat more fruits and vegetables
  . First, most fruits and vegetables are major contributors of a number of nutrients
  that are under-consumed in the United States, including folate, magnesium, potassium,
  dietary fiber, and vitamins A and C. Second, consumption of fruits and vegetables
  is associated with reduced risk of many chronic diseases. Specifically, moderate
  evidence indicates that intake of at least 2.5 cups of vegetables and fruits perday
  is associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, including heart attack
  and stroke. Some fruits and vegetables may be protective against certain types of
  cancer. Third, most fruits and vegetables, when prepared without added fats or sugars,
  are relatively low in calories. Consumption of fruits and vegetables instead of
  higher calorie foods can help adults and children achieve and maintain healthy weight.
  Currently, very few Americans consume diets that meet Dietary Guideline recommendations
  of fruits and vegetables. In fact, most Americans only consume about 42% of goal
  intake for fruits. For improving public health and reducing the risk of developing
  chronic diseases, the Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend that most people
  should eat at least 9 servings of fruits and vegetables per day based on a 2000
  kcal diet .


  Grapes are one of the most important fruit crops worldwide. They are consumed as
  fresh fruits as well as wine, juice and other processed products. There are about
  60 grape species in the genus of Vitis, and the species V. vinifera, or European
  grapes, is most widely cultivated. There are thousands of V. vinifera cultivars
  extant in the world. To obtain an assessment of the full range of phytochemicals
  in grapes, we recently analyzed 36 phenolic compounds in the berry samples of 344
  representative V. vinifera cultivars  and supported previous findings that grapes
  are rich in phytochemicals , . Demonstration of health benefits of these phytochemicals
  in grapes has been actively pursued. It has been reported that grape extracts exhibited
  antioxidant activities, including scavenging of free radicals, inhibition of lipid
  oxidation, and reduction of hydroperoxide formation , , and inhibit cardiovascular
  diseases and certain types of cancers, reducing plasma oxidative stress, and slowing
  aging , , .While there were many reports on the assessment of phytochemical compounds
  and their antioxidant activities of grapes, these studies were limited to only a
  few cultivars –.


  In this study, we determined the phytochemical profiles of 24 V. vinifera grape
  cultivars and analyzed their total antioxidant and antiproliferative activities.
  These 24 cultivars were selected on the basis of a previous study in which we demonstrated
  that these cultivars contained a wide range of the composition and content of phenolic
  compounds . The contribution of flavonoids to total phenolics and correlative relationships
  among phenolics, flavonoids, antioxidant activities and antiproliferative activities
  were also investigated.

  Berry samples of 24 V. vinifera grape cultivars were collected from the United States
  Department of Agriculture-Agricultural Research Service Vitis clonal repository
  in Davis, California. The grape berries were harvested upon ripening from the 2010
  vintages. All the vines received standard fertilization, irrigation, pruning, and
  insect and disease control. About 100 of representative berries were collected from
  each individual cultivar. Berry color was scored as green-yellow, pink, red, dark-red
  violet, blue black or red-black and compared with those recorded in the Germplasm
  Resources Information Network  when a cultivar was introduced. The number of berries
  was counted and the berry weight was recorded for each sample before being frozen
  and stored at −80°C for further processing. The frozen berries were then crushed
  using a mortar and pestle. After removing all the seeds, flesh and peel tissues
  were ground in an IKA A11 mill into powder while frozen using liquid nitrogen. All
  data collected for each grape cultivar were reported as mean ± SD with at least
  three replications.






  Table 1.  Description of V. vinifera grape samples used in the study and total phenolics
  and flavonoids content, ratio of total flavonoids to total phenolics, ORAC and PSC
  values, CAA with PBS washing and no PBS washing values.





  Total phenolics were extracted from ground berry samples using the method previously
  reported from our laboratory . Briefly, 10 g of grape powder was homogenized with
  30 mL of 80% chilled acetone/water using a Virtis High Speed Homogenizer for 3 min
  on the ice. After centrifugation at 3000 g for10 min at 4°C, the supernatant was
  collected, and 30 mL of fresh extraction solution were added and the extraction
  was repeated twice. All extracts were transferred into a round bottom flask, and
  were evaporated using a rotary evaporator at 45°C until the weight of the evaporated
  filtrate was less than10% of the weight of the original filtrate. The extracts were
  brought to a final volume of 10 mL with 70% methanol. All extracts were stored at
  −40°C until use. All extractions were analyzed in triplicates.




  Total phenolic content was determined using the Folin-Ciocalteu colorimetric method
  , which was modified by our laboratory . Briefly, all extracts were diluted 1:20
  with distilled water to obtain readings within the standard curve ranges of 0.0–600.0
  µg of gallic acid/mL. The grape extracts were oxidized by the Folin-Ciocalteu reagent
  and the reaction was acted in sodium carbonate. The absorbance was measured at 760
  nm, after 90 min at room temperature by a MRX II Dynex plate reader. The absorbance
  values were then compared with those of standards with known gallic acid concentrations.
  All values were expressed as the mean ± SD of three replications.




  The total flavonoid content was determined using the sodium borohydride/chloranil-based
  assay developed by our laboratory  with modifications . Briefly, 0.2 mL extracts
  of tested samples were added into test tubes, dried under nitrogen gas, and reconstituted
  in 1 mL of terahydrofuran/ethanol. Catechin standards were prepared fresh before
  use in 1 mL of THF/EtOH. Then 1 mL of 50 mM NaBH4 solution and 0.5 mL of 74.6 mM
  AlCl3 solution were added into each test tube with 1 mL of sample solution or 1
  mL of catechin standard solution. The test tubes were shaken in an orbital shaker
  at room temperature for 30 min. An additional 0.5 mL of 50.0 mM NaBH4 solution was
  added into each test tube with shaking continued for another 30 min at room temperature.
  Two millilitersof cold 0.8 M acetic acid solution was added into each test tube,
  and the solution was kept in the dark for 15 min after a thorough mix. One milliliter
  of 20.0 mM chloranil was added into each tube, which was heated at 95 °C with shaking
  for 60 min. The reaction solution was cooled using tap water, and the final volume
  was brought to 4 mL using methanol. One milliliter of 1052 mM vanillin was added
  into each tube and mixed. Then 2 mL of 12 M HCl was added to each tube, and the
  reaction solution was kept in the dark for 15 min after a thorough mix. Aliquots
  of final reaction solutions were added into each well of a 96-well plate, and the
  absorbance was measured at 490 nm using a MRX Microplate Reader with Revelation
  workstation. Total flavonoid content was expressed as milligrams of catechin equivalents
  per 100 g of fresh weight of sample. Data were reported as mean ± SD with at least
  triplicates.




  The antioxidant activity was determined using oxygen radical absorbance capacity
  assay  and modified in our laboratory . Phenolic extract dilutions were prepared
  with 75 mM phosphate buffer. The assay was performed in black-walled 96-well plates.
  The outside wells of the plate were not used as there was much more variation from
  them than from the inner wells. Each well contained 20 µL extracts or 20 µLTrolox
  standard, and 200 µL fluoroscein, which were incubated at 37°C for 20 min. After
  incubation, 20 µL of 119 mM ABAP was added to each well. Fluorescence intensity
  was measured using Fluoroskan Ascent FL plate-reader at excitation of 485 nm and
  emission of 520 nm for 35 cycles every 5 min. ORAC values were expressed as milligrams
  of TE/100 g FW. Data were reported as mean ± SD with triplicates.




  The antioxidant activity of extracts was determined by using a PSC assay developed
  in our lab  with modifications . Just prior to use in the reaction, 107 µL of 2.48
  mM dichlorofluorescein diacetate was hydrolyzed to dichlorofluorescein with 893
  µL of 1.0 mM KOH for 5 min in a vial to remove the diacetate moiety and then diluted
  with 7 mL of 75 mM phosphate buffer. ABAP was prepared fresh in the buffer and was
  kept at 4°C between runs. In an assay, 100 µL of extracts was diluted in 75 mM phosphate
  buffer and then transferred into reaction cells on a 96-well plate, and 100 µL of
  dichlorofluorescein was added. The 96-well plate was loaded into a Fluoroskan Ascent
  fluorescence spectrophotometer, and the solution in each cell was mixed by shaking
  at 1200 rpm for 20 s. The reaction was then initiated by adding 50 µL of ABAP from
  the autodispenser on the equipment. Each set of dilutions for a replicate and control
  was analyzed three times in adjacent columns. The reaction was carried out at 37°C,
  and fluorescence was monitored at 485 nm excitation and 538 nm emission with the
  fluorescence spectrophotometer. The buffer was used for control reactions. Data
  were acquired with Ascent software, version 2.6. Data were reported as mean ± SD
  with three replicates.




  HepG2 cells were grown in growth medium and were maintained at 37°C and 5% CO2 as
  described previously , . Cells used in this study were between passages or generations18
  and 28 at which the cells were at the most stable physiological status.




  Cytotoxicity was measured using the methylene blue assay developed by our laboratory
  with modifications . Briefly, HepG2 cells were seeded at 4×104/well on a 96-well
  plate in 100 µL of growth medium and incubated for 24 h at 37°C. The medium was
  removed, and the cells were washed with PBS. Treatments of fruit extracts or antioxidant
  compounds in 100 µL of treatment medium were applied to the cells, and the plates
  were incubated at 37°C for 24 h. The treatment medium was removed, and the cells
  were washed with PBS. A volume of 50 µL/well methylene blue staining solution was
  applied to each well, and the plate was incubated at 37°C for 1 h. The dye was removed,
  and the plate was immersed in fresh deionized water six times, or until the water
  became clear. The water was tapped out of the wells, and the plate was allowed to
  air-dry briefly before 100 µL of elution solution was added to each well. The microplate
  was placed on a bench-top shaker for 20 min to allow uniform elution. The absorbance
  was read at 570 nm with blank subtraction using the MRX II DYNEX spectrophotometer.
  Concentrations of fruit extracts that decreased the absorbance by &gt;10% when compared
  to the control were considered to be cytotoxic.




  The CAA was determined using the method previously developed in our laboratory .
  Briefly, HepG2 cells were seeded at a density of 6×104/well on a 96-well microplate
  in 100 µL of growth medium/well. Twenty-four hours after seeding, the growth medium
  was removed, and the wells were washed with PBS. Wells were then treated in triplicate
  for 1 h with 100 µL of treatment medium containing tested fruit extracts plus 25
  µM DCFH-DA. When a PBS wash was utilized, wells were washed with 100 µL of PBS.
  When no PBS wash was done between treatments, the activity may have been higher,
  but the CV also tended to be higher. This was likely due to the interaction of the
  samples and oxidants with other factors in the residual medium on the cells. Washing
  the cells with PBS removed most of the interfering medium components and increased
  the consistency of the results. Then 600 µM ABAP was applied to the cells in 100
  µL of HBSS, and the 96- well microplate was placed into a Fluoroskan Ascent FL plate
  reader at 37°C. Emission at 538 nm was measured after excitation at 485 nm every
  5 min for 1 h.


  After blank subtraction and subtraction of initial fluorescence values, the area
  under the curve for fluorescence versus time was integrated to calculate the CAA
  value at each concentration of fruit as Where ∫SA is the integrated area under the
  sample fluorescence versus time curve and ∫CA is the integrated area from the control
  curve. The median effective dose was determined for the fruits from the median effect
  plot of log(fa/fu) versus log(dose), where fa is the fraction affected and fu is
  the fraction unaffected by the treatment. The EC50 values were stated as mean ±
  SD for triplicate sets of data obtained from the same experiment. EC50 values were
  converted to CAA values, expressed as micromoles of quercetin equivalents per 100
  g of grape, using the mean EC50 value for quercetin from five separate experiments.




  The antiproliferative activity of different grape extracts was assessed by measurement
  of the inhibition of HepG2 human cancer cell proliferation. Antiproliferative activities
  were determined by the colorimetric methylene blue method developed by our laboratory  with
  modifications , . Human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells were seeded at a density
  of 2.5×104/well on a 96-well microplate in 100 µL of growth medium/well. The outside
  wells of the plate were not used as there was much more variation from them than
  those from the inner wells. After 4 h of incubation, the growth medium was removed
  and media containing various concentrations of grape extracts were added to the
  cells. Control cultures received the extraction solution minus the grape extracts,
  and blank wells contained 100 µL of growth medium without cells. Cell proliferation
  was determined at 96 h from the absorbance reading at 570 nm for each concentration
  when compared to the control, using at least three replications for each sample.
  The effective median dose was determined and expressed as milligrams of grape extracts
  per milliliter ± SD.




  Data from this study were reported as mean ± SD with at least three replicates for
  each sample extract.All graphical representations were performed using Sigmaplot
  10.0 for Windows, and all data were analyzed using SPSS 13.0 for Windows. Results
  were subjected to ANOVA, and differences between means were located using Tukey
  B multiple comparison test. Correlations between various parameters were also investigated.
  Significance was determined at P;0.05.






  Table 1shows the total phenolic contents of 24 V. vinifera grape cultivars. Among
  all the grape cultivars analyzed, Royalty and Mermark had the highest total phenolic
  content, and were significantly higher than other grape cultivars. Agwam and Muscat
  of Alexandria had the lowest total phenolic contents. There were 7-fold differences
  in the total phenolic contents between the highest and lowest ranked cultivars.
  Most green-yellow grape cultivars had lower total phenolic contents with no more
  than 300 mg of gallic acid equivalents/100 g FW except for Melon and Robola. On
  the contrary, colored grape cultivars had higher total phenolic contents and were
  more than 300 mg of gallic acid equivalents/100 g FW except for Ribier and two red
  cultivars of Mathilde and Agwam. All wine grape cultivars had higher total phenolic
  contents with more than 347.9 mg of gallic acid equivalents/100 g FW, but Agwam
  was an exception. All table grape cultivars had low phenolic contents except for
  Yourutico and Dornfelder.




  Total flavonoid contents of the 24 grape cultivars are presented in Table 1. The
  Royalty grape presented the highest flavonoid content and was significantly higher
  than other cultivars. Compared to most other cultivars, Pearl of Zola, Pirobelle,
  Coudsi, Thompson Seedless, Mathilde, Madam Matijas, and Agwam had relatively lower
  levels of total flavonoid contents. Muscat of Alexandria had the lowest flavonoid
  content. There were almost 11-fold differences in total flavonoid contents between
  the highest and lowest ranked cultivars. Melon and Robola had higher total flavonoid
  contents than other green-yellow cultivars in which no significant differences were
  detected. In general, colored cultivars had higher total flavonoid contents than
  green-yellow cultivars. Compared to wine grape cultivars, all table grape cultivars
  had lower flavonoid contents except for Yourutico, Dornfelder and Demir Kara. Total
  flavonoid contents of wine grape cultivars were higher than 300 mg of catechin equivalents/100
  g FW except for Agwam.




  The contributions of total flavonoids to total phenolics, calculated on the basis
  of micromoles of the total flavonoids and total phenolics, are presented in Table
  1. The contributions of total flavonoids to the total phenolicsin the 24 grape cultivars
  ranged from 40.3 to 91.3% with a mean 65.5%. The contributionsof flavonoids to total
  phenolics in Ruby Cabernet and Royalty were the highest among all cultivars. In
  contrast, the total flavonoid contents were no more than 50% of the total phenolic
  contents in Mathilde, Saint Macaire, Pearl of Zola, Madam Matijas and Touriga.




  The ORAC values for the 24 cultivars, expressed as mg of Trolox equivalents per
  100 g of fresh grape, are shown in Table 1.Variation of ORAC values ranged from
  378.7 to 3386.3 mg of Trolox equivalents/100 g FW, and the mean was 1339 mg. Royalty
  had the highest ORAC values, significantly higher than other cultivars. The other
  red flesh cultivars Salvador, Mermark and Corbeau also had relatively high ORAC
  values. Most green yellow cultivars had ORAC value no more than 733.0 mg of TE/100
  g FW except for Melon and Robola. Most colored cultivars had ORAC values more than
  909.0 mg of TE/100 g FW except for one blue-black cultivar and two red cultivars.
  All table grape cultivars had lower ORAC values except for Dornfelder, Demir Kara
  and Yourutico. All ORAC values of wine grape cultivars were higher than 1170.0 mg
  of TE/100 g FW except for Agwam.




  Total antioxidant activities measured by peroxyl radical scavenging capacity for
  the 24 cultivars are presented in Table 1with the PSC values expressed as mg of
  vitamin C equivalents/100 g FW. Royalty had the highest PSC values, and was significantly
  higher than other cultivars. Corbeau, Dornfelder and the other red flesh cultivar
  Salvador also had high PSC values. PSC values of all green yellow cultivars were
  lower than 100 mg of vitamin C equivalents/100 g FW except for Melon. In addition,
  most PSC values of colored cultivars were higher than 109 mg of vitamin C equivalents/100
  g FW except for a red cultivar and a blue black cultivar. Dornfelder had the highest
  PSC value in all table grapes, followed by Demir Kara, Yourutico, Pirobelle and
  Mathidle. The other PSC values of table grapes were no more than 73 mg of vitamin
  C equivalents/100 g FW. Most wine grapes had high PSC values except for Agwam, Robola
  and Melon.




  CAA values for 24 grape cultivars using the no PBS wash protocol are shown in Table
  1. CAA values ranged from 3.9 to 139.9 µmol of QE/100 g of grape, and the mean was
  41.5 µmol of QE/100 g of grape. Royalty had the highest CAA value, followed by Salvador
  and Ruby Cabernet. Demir Kara, Dornfelder, Touriga, Saint Macaire, Mermark, Robola,
  Corbeau and Yourutico, Cabernet Sauvignon, Melon had intermediate high CAA activities,
  but were not significantly different from each other. Then the rankings of CAA activities
  were followed by Plavac Mali, Araclinos, Pearl of Zola, Pirobelle, Ribier and Coudsi.
  Madam Matijas, Thompson Seedless, Mathilde, Agwam and Muscat Alexandria had the
  lowest CAA values among the 24 grape cultivars tested.


  In using the PBS wash protocol, CAA values ranged from 1.4to 95.8 µmol of QE/100
  g of grape, and the mean was 25.7 µmol of QE/100 g of grape. Royalty had the greatest
  cellular antioxidant activity among the cultivars tested. Salvador ranked second,
  and Ruby Cabernet and Dornfelder were third and fourth in CAA activities, respectively.
  Plavac Mali and Corbeau and other cultivars were in descending order in their CAA
  activities. Muscat of Alexandria and Agwam had the lowest CAA values. In both PBS
  wash and no PBS wash protocols, the CAA values were significantly higher in wine
  grapes than in table grapes. This was also true in colored grapes when compared
  with green-yellow grapes.






  Table 2.  Mean contents of total phenolics, total flavonoids, ORAC and PSC values
  among different types of grapes.





  Correlations among the total phenolics, total flavonoids, ORAC values and PSC values
  were analyzed. Significantly positive correlations were found between total phenolics
  and total flavonoids, and between ORAC and PSC values. The ORAC values had significantly
  positive correlations with total phenolics and total flavonoids. In comparison,
  the PSC values also had significantly positive correlations with total phenolics
  and total flavonoids, but the correlation coefficients were lower than those observed
  for the ORAC values.






  Table 3.  The relationship among total phenolics, total flavonoids, ORAC, PSC and
  CAA values.



  The relationships of total phenolics content, total flavonoids content, ORAC values,
  and PSC values with CAA values were also determined. CAA values were significantly
  positively correlated with total phenolics, total flavonoids, ORAC values and PSC
  values when no PBS wash protocol was used. While significantly positive correlation
  relationships were also found between CAA values and total phenolics, total flavonoids,
  ORAC values and PSC values using the PBS wash protocol,the coefficients of correlation
  were lower than those with no PBS wash.




  The effects of extracts from the 24 grape cultivars against the growth of HepG2
  human liver cancer cells in vitro are presented in Figure 1. Overall, grape extracts
  had potent antiproliferative activities against HepG2 human liver cancer cell growth
  in dose-dependent manners. The inhibition of cancer cell proliferation by the 24
  grape extracts ranged from 25 to 82% at the concentration of 100 mg/mL extract applied.
  Robola, Plavac Mali, Royalty, Saint Macaire, Touriga, Coudsi, Ruby Cabernet,and
  Demir Kara exhibited relatively higher antiproliferative activities towards HepG2
  cells. The EC25 and EC50of the antiproliferative activities of different grape cultivars
  are presented in Table 4. Lower EC25 and EC50values represent higher antiproliferative
  activities. There were no significant differences in antiproliferative activities
  between wine and table grapes, but in general, the antiproliferative activities
  of red grapes were higher than those of yellow-green grapes. There were no detected
  cytotoxicities towards HepG2 cells in vitro at the concentration of 150 mg/mL of
  grape extracts in all 24 grape cultivars tested, indicating that antiproliferative
  activities were not caused by cytoxicity .

  human HepG2 liver cancer cells.





  Regular consumption of fruits and vegetables has been linked to reduced risk of
  developing chronic diseases , . Grapes and their products are rich in phytochemicals,
  which are proven to possess many health benefits. Grape phytochemicals include anthocyanins,
  flavanols, flavonols, stilbenes and phenolic acids and their contents and profiles
  can vary significantly among different V. vinifera cultivars , .There have been
  studies attempting to link phytochemical profiles with their total antioxidant activities
  in V. vinifera, but these studies were limited to just a few cultivars . Here we
  reported phytochemical profiles of 24 V. vinifera cultivars and studied the relationships
  among total phenolics, total flavonoids, total antioxidant activities, cellular
  antioxidant activities, and antiproliferative activities in these cultivars. These
  24 V. vinifera cultivars were a part of the core collection of V. vinifera germplasm
  preserved at the USDA-ARS Vitis clonal repository in Davis, California and they
  were selected for this study on the basis of their compositions and contents of
  polyphenolic compounds reported in a previous study .


  The present study, using a different, more accurate detection method for the total
  phenolic compounds, confirmed our previous result that the 24 cultivars selected
  for this study had a wide range of variation in their total phenolic contents. The
  mean total phenolic content ranged from 95.3 to 686.5 mg of gallic acid equivalents/100
  g FW. In contrast, Yang et al.  reported that the total phenolic contents of 14
  wine grapes ranged from 201.1 to 424.6 mg of gallic acid equivalent/100 g of fruits.
  The difference in these observations, to a large extent, was certainly attributed
  to different cultivars used in the studies. It should be pointed out that there
  could be some other factors which may contribute to these differences. For example,
  samples collected from different vineyards or vintages could have significant influence
  on the total phenolic content as reported by Arnous et al  and Kallithraka et al.
  . The wide range of variation of total phenolic contents among the grape cultivars
  in this study offered us a unique opportunity to investigate the correlative relationships
  of phenolic compounds with some health benefit measurements such as antioxidant
  and antiproliferative activities. In consistence with our earlier study , the total
  phenolic contents of wine grapes were significantly higher than those of table grapes;
  and total phenolics of colored grape cultivars were higher than those of green yellow
  grape cultivars.


  This study was the first to determine total flavonoid content in grapes using a
  new method developed . Determination of total flavonoids in foods is challenging.
  The most common methods for determining the content of total flavonoids include
  Aluminum Chloride colorimetric assay ,  and high performance liquid chromatography.
  However, these two methods each have certain limitations. AlCl3 colorimetric assay
  only measures partial flavonoids and therefore cannot be used accurately to determine
  total flavonoids , . HPLC is an excellent method to determine individual flavonoids,
  but cannot be used to determine the total flavonoids because the method is limited
  by the availability of flavonoid standards and many un-identified flavonoids are
  present in foods , . The SBC assay developed by our lab can detect all types of
  flavonoids, including flavones, flavonols, flavonones, flavononols, isoflavonoids
  and anthocyanins . The total flavonoid contents in the 24 grape cultivars, measured
  by SBC assay varied from 94.7 to 1055 mg of catechin equivalents/100 g FW. Anthocyanins
  were the dominant in total flavonoids in colored grape cultivars according to our
  previous study . The total flavonoid contents of wine grapes were significantly
  higher than those of table grapes; and total flavonoids of colored grape cultivars
  were higher than those of green yellow grape cultivars because colored grape cultivars
  had high anthocyanins content and most wine grape cultivars were colored grapes.
  These results were consistent with those reported as the sum of individual flavonoids
  using HPLC .


  The contribution of total flavonoids to total phenolics, calculated on the micromole
  basis, ranged from 40.3 to 91.3%. Further analysis found no significant differences
  in the contributions of total flavonoids to total phenolics between table and wine
  grapes, or between colored and green yellow grapes. These results suggested that
  flavonoids are one of the major phytochemicals in grapes and their relative contributions
  to the total phenolics are not dependent on the types of grape cultivars.


  The mean ORAC values of wine grapes were 1769±206.1 mg of Trolox equivalents/100
  g FW and significantly higher than those in table grapes. In addition, the ORAC
  values of colored grapes were significantly higher than those of green yellow grapes.


  The PSC values for the 24 grape cultivars ranged from14.2 to 557 mg of vitamin C
  equivalents/100 g FW, indicating that there was a wide-range of variation across
  all 24 grape cultivars. Adom and Liu  reported the PSC value of red grapes was 371
  mg of vitamin C equivalents/100 g FW, which was in the range of the results we reported
  here. The mean of PSC values of wine grapes was significantly higher than that of
  table grapes. Similarly, the PSC values of colored grape cultivars were higher than
  those of green yellow grape cultivars.


  The 24 cultivars were also evaluated for their antioxidant activity in the CAA assay.
  The CAA values of Royalty, Salvador, Ruby Cabernet, Demir Kara, Dornfelder and Corbeauwere
  higher than other cultivars. These cultivars also had higher total phenolics and
  total flavonoids, and higher ORAC and PSC values. Among these cultivars, Royalty,
  Salvador and Corbeau are red flesh grape cultivars and tend to be rich in anthocyanins.
  The mean CAA values were 32.0 µmol of QE/100 g of grape for colored grape cultivars
  and 10.3 µmol for green yellow grape cultivars using the PBS wash protocol. But
  higher CAA values were observed when no PBS wash protocol was used. We also observed
  that the CAA values in wine grapes were significantly higher than these in table
  grapes. The general trends of these results were in agreement with those of Wolfe
  et al. , , but this study covered a much larger range of cultivar variation in terms
  of both color and end-product types.


  The inhibition of HepG2 liver cancer cell proliferation by extracts from the 24
  grape cultivars ranged from 25 to 82% at the concentration of 100 mg/mL extracts
  applied. Yang et al.  reported that the phytochemical extracts of Pinot Noir and
  Chardonnay varieties exhibited strong antiproliferative activity towards HepG2 cells
  with the lowest EC50values of 17.0±0.8 mg/mL and 18.1±0.1 mg/mL, respectively. On
  the other hand, the phytochemical extracts of Vidal Blanc and DeChaunac showed a
  relatively weak antiproliferative activity with higher EC50values of 52.1±2.1 and
  52.2±3.0 mg/mL, respectively . Our results in this study were similar to the results
  of Vidal Blanc and DeChaunacas reported by Yang et al. . In consistent with other
  results, the colored grape cultivars had higher antiproliferative activities than
  those of green yellow grape cultivars.


  Correlations among total phenolics, total flavonoids, total antioxidant activity,
  cell proliferation, and cellular antiocxdant activities were analyzed. There were
  significantly correlative relationship among total phenolics, total flavonoids and
  antioxidant activities, which were in agreement with what was reported by Arnous
  et al  and Kallithraka et al. . No significantly correlative relationships were
  found between total antioxidant and antiproliferative activities against HepG2 liver
  cancer cells. Additionally, the total phenolic and flavonoid contents of grapes
  did not correlate with the antiproliferative activities. These results were consistent
  with what were previously reported in literature , , suggesting that specific phytochemicals,
  rather than the total phytochemicals, might be responsible for the antiproliferative
  activities. Different phytochemicals might act additively and/or synergistically
  to contribute to the total antiproliferative activities in grapes. The CAA values
  for fruits were significantly positively related to total phenolic content and total
  flavonoids when log-transformed data were analyzedin this study. The correlation
  coefficients for CAA values and total phenolics, total flavonoids, ORAC and PSC
  values were higher for the no PBS wash protocol than these for the PBS wash protocol
  in this study. These results were consistent with what Wolfe et al. reported previously
  . This is in contrast to a study involving vegetable extracts, in which prevention
  of DCFH oxidation in HepG2 cells by vegetable extracts was not correlated to ORAC
  or total phenolics . Our current study suggested that total phenolic content might
  be a better predictor for the cellular antioxidant activity of grapes than the ORAC
  value, despite the commonality of measuring peroxyl radical scavenging abilities
  in both of the antioxidant activity assays.


  Among the 24 cultivars evaluated, Royalty grape showed highest total phenolic content,
  total flavonoid content, ORAC, PSC and CAA values. It was the one which had consistent
  and high correlations among these measurements. Several other cultivars such as
  Corbeau, Salvador and Mermark also had high levels of phytochemicals, and antioxidant
  activities. On the other hand, Cabernet Sauvignon, a well-known wine grape cultivar,
  had relative high levels of total phenolic and flavonoid contents, but its ORAC
  and PSC values were about average. Some of the differences are certainly due to
  varietal genetic background. For example, Royalty is a red flesh cultivar with abundant
  anthocyanins produced in whole fruits, while many other cultivars including Cabernet
  Sauvignon are not.


  In summary, grapes are rich in phenolics and flavonoids. Although viticulture practices,
  environmental conditions, and post-harvest processing can affect the content of
  total phenolics, total flavonoids, or individual bioactive compounds in grapes and
  grape products, varietal or genetic difference is one of the most important factors.
  Here we observed tremendous variation in total phenolic and total flavonoid contents,
  and ORAC, PSC and CAA values among the24 grape cultivars tested. The total antioxidant
  activities of grapes were significantly correlated with the total phenolics and
  flavonoids. However, no significant correlations were found between total phenolic
  content, total flavonoid content, ORAC, PSC values, or CAA values with the antiproliferative
  activities in this study. Lack of such correlations provides both challenges and
  opportunities in future studies. Total phenolics, total flavonoids, ORAC, PSC and
  CAA values of wine grapes and colored grapes were significantly higher than those
  of table grapes and green-yellow grapes. Another important finding from this study
  was the identification of several germplasm accessions with much high contents of
  phenolics and flavonoids, and total antioxidant activity. This information is important
  for breeding grape cultivars with better nutritional qualities of wine and table
  grapes in the future.
