  Breast cancer is the most common cancer and the leading cause of cancer death in
  women. Although tamoxifen therapy is successful for some patients, it does not provide
  adequate benefit for those who have estrogen receptor-negative cancers. Therefore,
  we approached novel treatment strategies by combining two potential bioactive dietary
  supplements for the reactivation of ERα expression for effective treatment of ERα-negative
  breast cancer with tamoxifen. Bioactive dietary supplements such as green tea polyphenols
  and sulforaphane inhibit DNA methyltransferases and histone deacetylases, respectively,
  which are of central importance to cancer prevention. In the present study, we have
  observed that treatment of ERα-negative breast cancer cells with GTPs and SFN alone
  or in combination leads to the reactivation of ERα expression. The combination of
  20 µg/mL GTPs and 5 µM SFN was found to be the optimal dose of ERα-reactivation
  at 3 days in MDA-MB-231 cells. The reactivation of ERα expression was consistently
  correlated with ERα promoter hypomethylation and hyperacetylation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation
  analysis of the ERα promoter revealed that GTPs and SFN altered the binding of ERα-transcriptional
  co-repressor complex thereby contributing to ERα-reactivation. In addition, treatment
  with tamoxifen in combination with GTPs and SFN significantly increased both cell
  death and inhibition of cellular proliferation in MDA-MB-231 cells in comparison
  to treatment with tamoxifen alone. Collectively, our findings suggest that a novel
  combination of bioactive-HDAC inhibitors with bioactive-demethylating agents is
  a promising strategy for the effective treatment of hormonal refractory breast cancer
  with available anti-estrogens.

  Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer
  death among women, accounting for 23% of the total cancer cases and 14% of the cancer
  deaths . One of the important classifications of breast tumors is based on the presence
  or absence of the estrogen receptor. While the majority of breast cancers are ER-positive,
  approximately 25–30% are ER-negative , . Patients with ER-positive breast cancer
  receive hormonal therapy using either selective estrogen receptor modulators such
  as tamoxifen, raloxifene and lasofoxifene, or with aromatase inhibitors such as
  anastrozole, letrozole, and exemestene, and have a better prognosis. However, treatment
  of patients with ER-negative tumor is challenging due to the poor response to hormonal
  therapies in the absence ER expression. Therefore alternative targeted therapies
  are aimed to prevent and treat hormonal refractory breast cancers.


  Recently, many studies have addressed the possibilities of reactivation of ER expression
  in ER-negative breast cancer cells for the effective treatment with available SERMs.
  Further, the absence of ERα gene expression in ER-negative breast cancer is largely
  due to epigenetic silencing instead of DNA mutation or deletion of the ERα gene
  , . Previous studies have shown that epigenetic silencing of ER is associated with
  DNA hypermethylation at the ER-promoter in ER-negative breast cancer cells , . In
  addition, histone modifications, specifically histone acetylation/deactylations
  have also been implicated as common mechanisms underlying ER silencing in human
  malignant mammary cells , . Hence, treatment of ER-negative breast cancer cells
  with DNA methyltransferase inhibitors such as 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine and/or histone
  deacetylase inhibitors such as trichostatin A leads to the reactivation of ER expression,
  underscoring the importance of DNMTs and HDACs in maintaining the repressive environment
  at the ERα gene , , . However, the use of synthetic small molecules as the DNMT
  and HDAC inhibitors for the ER-reactivation in ER-negative breast tumor would be
  expected to result in too many adverse side-effects to warrant practical application
  to chemoprevention and therapy.


  Many studies have demonstrated the chemopreventive properties of green tea polyphenols
  and sulforaphane against various types of carcinoma through multiple mechanisms
  such as anti-oxidant, induction of apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, inhibition
  of angiogenesis and metastasis , . Further,-epigallocatechin-3-gallate, a major
  constituent of GTPs, is known to complex with the DNA methyltransferases which reduces
  methylating activity of many genes in cancer cells as well as in mouse models ,
  . The hypomethylation induced by EGCG has been shown to be associated with reactivation
  of methylation-silenced tumor suppressor genes such as p16INK4a, p21CIP/WAF and
  the DNA mismatch repair gene, human mutL homologue 1, which eventually leads to
  tumor suppression , . Further, SFN is a bioactive dietary supplement found in cruciferous
  vegetables, that has an established histone deactylation inhibition activity , .
  The HDAC inhibition activity of SFN has been shown to lead to an increase in the
  global and local histone acetylation status of a number of genes including tumor
  promoter genes such as human telomerase reverse transcriptase in breast cancer .
  Both DNA methylation and histone acetylations have been the focus of considerable
  attention in cancer prevention and therapy.


  In addition to histone acetylation and promoter methylation, histone modifications-mediated
  transcriptional regulation of ERα expression has emerged. The ERα promoter is mostly
  hypermethylated in ER-negative breast cancer cells , . Hypermethylation of CpG-islands
  may inhibit transcription by recruiting the methyl-CpG binding domain proteins or
  by interfering with the recruitment and function of basal transcription factors
  or transcriptional coactivators , . Similarly, ER-negative breast cancer cells also
  display a relative depletion of acetyl-H3 and acetyl-H4 which provide transcriptional
  repressive environment at the ERα gene  Therefore, in the present study, we tested
  our hypothesis that a combination of dietary DNMT and HDAC inhibitors may lead to
  transcriptional activation of ERα expression in ER-negative breast cancer cells.
  Our study demonstrates that treatment of ER-negative breast cancer cells with GTPs
  and SFN synergistically reactivates ERα expression through epigenetic alteration
  of CpG methylation and histone acetylation-mediated release of transcriptional inhibitor
  complex at the ERα promoter. Furthermore, our findings suggest a novel dietary combination
  of DNA methyltransferase and histone deacetylase inhibitors contribute to ER re-expression
  in ER-negative breast cancer for the effective treatment of hormonal refractory
  breast cancers with available SERMs.






  GTPs and R, S-sulforaphane were purchased from LKT laboratories. GTPs was freshly
  prepared at a stock concentration of 1 mg/mL in sterile PBS just before cellular
  treatment. SFN was prepared in DMSO and stored at a stock concentration of 10 mmol/L
  at −20°C.




  The human breast cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection.
  Breast cancer MCF-7 , MDA-MB-453  and MDA-MB-231  cells were cultured as a monolayer
  in phenol-red–free Dulbeccos modified Eagles medium supplemented with 10% dextran-charcoal–stripped
  fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin as described previously , . Control
  MCF10A cells were also procured from ATCC and maintained as described previously
  . MCF10A is a non-tumorigenic human breast epithelial cell line and frequently used
  as a human breast cell control , , . Cells were treated with GTPs or SFN and a combination
  of both at the indicated concentrations. The medium with GTPs and SFN was replaced
  every 24 h for the duration of the experiments. The maximum concentration of DMSO
  in the culture medium was 0.1%. MTT assay was performed for assessing cellular proliferation.
  Briefly, cells were plated at a density of 1×104 cells per well in 200 µL of complete
  medium containing different concentrations of GTPs or SFN and combination of both
  in a 96-well microtiter plate. Each treatment was repeated in 8 wells. The cells
  were incubated for 96 h at 37°C in a humidified chamber at the end of which MTT
  solution was added to each well and incubated for 2 h. The microtiter plate containing
  the cells was centrifuged at 600 g for 5 min at 4°C. The MTT solution was removed
  from the wells by aspiration and the MTT-formazan crystals were dissolved in DMSO.
  Absorbance was recorded at 540 nm wavelength. To observe the effects of 17β-estradiol
  and tamoxifen on cellular apoptosis, MDA-MB-231 cells were treated from the second
  day after treatments with GTPs and SFN.




  Total RNA isolation and real-time quantification of ERα expression were followed
  as described previously . Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy kit according
  to the manufacturers instructions. Total RNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA using
  the iScript cDNA synthesis kit. The primers specific for ERα and glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate
  dehydrogenase were obtained from Inventorial Gene Assay Products. The reaction was
  performed in a Bio-Rad MyiQ thermocycler using platinum SYBR Green detection system.
  Thermal cycling was initiated at 94°C for 4 min followed by 35 cycles of PCR. The
  calculations for determining the relative level of gene expression were made using
  the cycle threshold method. The mean Ct values from duplicate measurements were
  used to calculate the expression of the target gene using the formula: fold change
  in gene expression, 2−ΔΔCt = 2−{ΔCt−ΔCt}, where ΔCt = Ct−Ct.




  Protein was extracted from cultured cells using the RIPA-lysis buffer following
  the manufacturers protocol. For immunoblot analysis, 100 µg of protein was resolved
  on a 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. After incubation
  in blocking buffer for 1 h, the membranes were incubated with the primary antibodies
  specific for ERα, DNMT1, DNMT3a, DNMT3b, SUV39H1, HDAC antibody sampler kit and
  β-actin. The blot was then washed with TBS and 0.05% Tween-20 and incubated with
  specific secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. Protein bands
  were then visualized using the ECL-detection system following the protocol of the
  manufacturer. The bands were analyzed by using Kodak 1D 3.6.1 image software for
  the intensity and normalized with respective β-actin.




  Cells were grown on the sterile cover slips and treated with GTPs and SFN for 3
  days. After the treatment period, cells were fixed with cold-ethanol, permeabilized
  with 0.1% Triton- X100 in phosphate buffered saline, and washed with PBS for 10
  min. The cells were then blocked with 5% goat serum in PBS for 30 min, followed
  by incubation with 3% H2O2 for 20 min to quench endogenous peroxidase. After washing
  the cells with PBS, cells were incubated with 5- mC specific antibody for 1 h, followed
  by sequential incubation of cells with biotinylated secondary antibody, and HRP-conjugated
  streptavidin, and finally with diaminobenzidine substrate for 5-mC positive staining.
  Nuclei were counterstained with methyl green.




  Cells were treated with GTP and SFN for 3 days as described above. Genomic DNA was
  isolated using the DNA Isolation Kit according to the manufacturers instructions,
  and dot-blot analysis was performed as described previously . Briefly, 1 µg of genomic
  DNA was transferred onto Hybond-ECL nitrocellulose membranes using Bio-Dot Microfiltration
  Apparatus, and fixed by baking the membrane for 30 min at 80°C. After blocking the
  non-specific-binding sites, the membrane was incubated with the antibody specific
  to 5-mC followed by incubation with a HRP-conjugated secondary antibody. The bands
  were then visualized using the ECL-detection system following the protocol of the
  manufacturer. The bands were analyzed by using Kodak 1D 3.6.1 image software for
  the intensity and equal DNA loading was verified by staining the membranes with
  0.2% methylene blue.




  DNMTs activity was determined using a colorimetric DNMTs activity assay kit according
  to the manufacturers instruction. The reaction was initiated by adding 20 µg of
  nuclear extracts, containing active DNMTs, to the unique cytosine-rich DNA substrate-coated
  ELISA plate and incubated for 60 min at 37°C. The methylated DNA can be recognized
  with anti-5-methylcytosine antibody. The amount of methylated DNA, which is proportional
  to enzyme activity, is calorimetrically quantified at 450 nm.




  Cultured MDA-MB-231 cells were harvested at the indicated time points and nuclear
  extracts were prepared using the nuclear extraction reagent. The activities of HDACs
  and HATs were performed using the colorimetric kit according to the manufacturers
  instruction as described previously . The enzymatic activities of HDACs and HATs
  were detected by a microplate reader at 450 nm.




  Chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed using the EZ-ChIP kit according to the
  manufacturers instructions as described previously . MCF-7 cells were used as a
  positive control. Cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde at 37°C for 10 min,
  washed twice with ice-cold PBS, re-suspended in SDS-lysis buffer, and then sonicated
  to an average length of sheered genomic DNA of approximately 400–1000 bp. The antibodies
  used in the ChIP assays were ChIP-validated acetyl-histone H3, acetyl-histone H3K9,
  acetyl-histone H4, trimethyl-histone H3K9, HDAC1, MeCP2, MBD1, SUV39H1 and DNMT1.
  A “no antibody” control was also used to evaluate-ChIP efficiency. ChIP-purified
  DNA was quantified by using quantitative-PCR using the Platinum SYBR Green detection
  system and q-PCR specific ERα primer as described earlier , . The binding of various
  transcription factors to the ERα promoter was analyzed by standard PCR conditions
  as described previously . Briefly, the ERα promoter primers were forward-5′-GAA
  CCG TCC GCA GCT CAA GAT C-3′, reverse-5′-GTC TGA CCG TAG ACC TGC GCG TTG-3′, with
  a total of 30 cycles at 94°C for 30 s, 56°C for 30 s, 72°C for 1 min and final extension
  was extended at 72°C for 5 min. After amplification, PCR products were separated
  on 1.5% agarose gels and visualized by ethidium bromide staining using Kodak 1D
  3.6.1 image software and quantified. Quantitative data were analyzed by optical
  densitometry using ImageJ Software version 1.36b.




  The DNA methylation status of the ERα promoter was assayed by sodium bisulfite methylation
  sequencing using the EpiTect-Bisulfite modification kit following the manufactures
  protocol. Approximately 2 µg of genomic DNA was used for bisulfite modification
  and then amplified by PCR using Go Taq mix. Primers and PCR-conditions were followed
  as described previously . PCR amplified DNA was purified using the QIAquick PCR
  purification kit and sequenced using the 3730 DNA Sequencer. Percent methylation
  was calculated using the following formula: Number of methylated CpG×100/total number
  of CpGs assessed.




  Approximately 2.2×105 cells per well were placed in a 6-well plate and allowed to
  incubate overnight. The ERα siRNA was made into 10 µM stock using nuclease free
  water and 9 nM siRNA was delivered to the cells using the Silencer siRNA Transfection
  kit according to the manufacturers instructions. siCONTROL Non-Targeting siRNA was
  used as a negative control. Treatments incorporating GTPs and SFN with or without
  TAM were performed for an additional 72 h. Cells were harvested and checked for
  ERα knockdown after 3 days using western blot analysis.




  Breast cancer cells transfected with ERα and control siRNA transfected cells were
  treated with the indicated concentrations of GTPs and SFN with or without TAM for
  72 h. The cells were then lysed with nuclei lysis buffer provided for apoptosis
  assays using the Cell Death Detection ELISA Kit as described previously . Briefly,
  the cytoplasmic histone/DNA fragments were extracted and incubated in microtiter
  plate modules coated with anti-histone antibody. Subsequently, the peroxidase-conjugated
  anti-DNA antibody was used for the detection of immobilized histone/DNA fragments,
  followed by color development with 2,2′-azinobis(3-ethylbenzo-thiazoline-6-​sulfonicacid)
  substrate for peroxidase. The spectrophotometric absorbance of the samples was recorded
  using Microplate Reader at 405 nm. Percent apoptosis was calculated using the formula:−100.




  The statistical significance of differences between the values of treated samples
  and controls were determined with Kruskal-Wallis with Dunns post test using GraphPad
  Prism version 4.00 for Windows, GraphPad Software, San Diego, California, USA. In
  each case, P;0.05 was considered statistically significant.






  First to examine whether GTPs and SFN have any synergistic cellular proliferation
  inhibitory activity on human breast cancer cells, we performed cell viability assay
  with GTP and SFN alone or in combination treatments for 3 days. We intended to determine
  the optimal dose that will induce ERα transcriptional activation without causing
  cellular toxicity, thereby studying possible mechanisms involved in the ERα-reactivation
  in ERα-negative MDA-MB-231 cells. The MTT-cell viability assay was performed with
  the MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-453 cells treated with various concentrations of GTPs
  and SFN alone or in combinations as shown in Fig. 1A. We observed a dose-dependent
  cell growth inhibition with GTPs and SFN treatments in both ER-negative MDA-MB-453
  and MDA-MB-231 cells, which became significant at 80 µg/ml and 40 µM, respectively.
  However, the combination of GTPs and SFN synergistically induced cell growth inhibition
  at 20 µg/ml GTPs and 10 µM SFN in these ERα-negative cells. The synergistic cell
  growth inhibitory effects were well pronounced at higher doses of GTPs and SFN.
  Further, MDA-MB-231 showed less cellular viability inhibitory effect than MDA-MB-453
  at indicated GTPs and SFN doses, which might be due to the triple-negative in nature.
  Therefore, for further studies we chose MDA-MB-231 cells with minimum effect and
  triple-negative in nature; thereby we can study the mechanisms without toxicity.
  Control MCF10A cells were slightly inhibited in cell growth with combination of
  40 µg/ml GTPs and 20 µM SFN after 3 days of treatment, indicating that higher combination
  doses might be toxic to the normal breast cells. These results indicate that lower
  doses of combined GTPs and SFN selectively inhibit ERα-negative breast cancer cells;
  however, the optimal doses required for the transcriptional activation of ERα remained
  to be determined in our subsequent studies.






  Figure 1.  Combined GTPs and SFN synergistically inhibit cellular proliferation
  of ERα-negative breast cancer cells but has negligible effect on control MCF10A
  cells.


  Human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-453 cells, and control MCF10A cells were
  treated with varying concentrations of GTPs and SFN as well as a combination of
  both the compounds for 3 days. Percent cell viability was obtained using MTT assay
  as described under Materials and Methods. Results were obtained from three independent
  experiments, mean ± SD. Statistical significance, P&lt;0.05.





  To determine the optimal dose of GTPs and SFN for the ERα reactivation, MDA-MB-231
  cells were treated with increasing concentrations of GTPs and SFN for 3 days as
  shown in Fig. 2A. GTPs induced ERα mRNA expression at a concentration as low as
  10 µg/ml, but the maximum significant effect was observed at 20 µg/ml. Similarly,
  SFN induced significant ERα expression starting from 5 µM and the maximum ERα reactivation
  was observed at 10 µM doses. Furthermore, in combination treatments, 20 µg/ml GTPs
  and 5 µM SFN were shown to induce optimal significant synergistic reactivation of
  ERα mRNA in ERα-negative MDA-MB-231 cells after 24 h of post-treatment compared
  to non-treated control. However, although SFN at 10 µM alone achieved the maximum
  significant ERα reactivation in MDA-MB-231 cells, in combination with GTPs the optimal
  doses of SFN was found to be 5 µM. Further, the combination of 20 µg/ml GTPs and
  5 µM SFN at 72 h post-treatment with MDA-MB-231 cells induced a significant ERα
  reactivation compared to the respective individual doses of GTPs and SFN at 72 h.
  Western blot analysis showed that the combination of GTPs and SFN significantly
  reactivated ERα protein expression in ERα-negative MDA-MB-231 cells after 24 h of
  post-treatment. The ERα reactivation was considerably higher at 72 h of post-combinational
  doses of 20 µg/ml GTPs and 5 µM SFN in MDA-MB-231 cells. These results indicated
  that the low concentrations of GTPs and SFN did not induce significant cellular
  toxicity, but induced transcriptional and translational reactivation of ERα expression
  in the ERα-negative human breast cancer cells. Based on these results, we therefore
  chose to use the concentrations of GTPs and SFN as optimized in Fig. 2 for subsequent
  experiments.






  Figure 2.  GTPs and SFN synergistically reactivated ERα expression in ERα-negative
  human breast cancer cells.


  A) GTPs and SFN at indicated doses induced ERα re-expression in ERα-negative MDA-MB-231
  human breast cancer cells after 72 h of post-treatments. B) Treatment with GTPs
  or SFN and a combination of both of the compounds at indicated doses induced ERα
  re-expression in ERα-negative human breast cancer cells. Relative mRNA levels of
  ERα in GTPs and SFN treated cells were quantified at 12, 24, 48 and 72 h using real-time
  PCR. Data are in triplicates from three independent experiments and were normalized
  to GAPDH. The values were plotted against control as relative fold induction ± SD.
  Significance against nontreated control, P&lt;0.05, P&lt;0.001; aP&lt;0.05 against
  individual GTPs and SFN doses at the same time interval. C) ERα protein expression
  with the treatment of GTPs or SFN alone or in combination at 12, 24, 48 and 72 h
  in MDA-MB-231 cells. ERα-positive MCF-7 cells served as a positive control. Actin
  was used as an equal loading control.





  Previous studies have shown that ERα activation is associated with DNA methylation
  and histone modifications; we therefore assessed epigenetic-modulating enzymatic
  activity of the DNMTs, HDACs, HATs and DNMTs as well as HDACs expression in ERα-negative
  MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, using GTPs and SFN treatments. Interestingly, GTPs
  and SFN significantly reduced HATs and HDACs activities, respectively, at the optimal
  doses used as shown in Fig. 3B. This is in accordance with previous studies that
  EGCG has a HAT inhibitory activity, and SFN poses a HDACs inhibitory activity ,
  , . However, the combination of GTPs with SFN additively enhanced HDACs inhibitory
  activity of SFN in MDA-MB-231 cells but not HATs inhibitory activity. Further, HDAC
  expression analysis showed that the combination of GTPs with SFN considerably inhibits
  HDAC1, HDAC4 and HDAC6 expression in MDA-MB-231 cells, in accordance with HDAC inhibitory
  activity observed in Fig. 3B. It is known that EGCG, an active compound present
  in GTPs, is a DNMTs inhibitor; similarly we have also observed that GTPs treatment
  considerably inhibited DNMTs activity and expression in MDA-MB-231 cells. Interestingly,
  we found that SFN, a HDACs inhibitor, also inhibits DNMTs activity significantly
  in MDA-MB-231 cells. The combinations of GTPs and SFN have more pronounced DNMTs
  inhibitory effects than when administrated separately. The combination doses mediated
  inhibition of DNMTs expression could be an important contributing factor in altering
  the binding of MBD-proteins at the ERα promoter. To our surprise, not only DNMTs
  but also histone methyltransferase, SUV39H1, is also inhibited by GTPs and SFN.
  The GTPs- and SFN-mediated inhibition of DNMTs and SUV39H1 expressions could be
  an important contributing factor in facilitating demethylation of the ERα promoter,
  which leads to transcriptional activation of ERα expression , .






  Figure 3.  GTPs and SFN altered epigenetic enzymes expression and their activity
  in ERα-negative breast cancer cells.


  Breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with the indicated concentration of
  GTPs and SFN alone or in combinations of both for 3 days. Nuclear extracts were
  prepared and 20 µg of protein was used to estimate DNMTs, HDAC and HATs activities
  using the colorimetric assay kit as described under Materials and Methods. Non-treated
  MCF-7 cells were used as a positive control. Values are representative of three
  independent experiments and represented as percent control ± SD; statistical significance

  at the indicated doses followed by western blotting to analyze DNMTs, HDACs and
  SUV39H1 expression. Non-treated MCF-7 cells were used as a positive control. Actin
  was used as an equal loading control. D) Graphical representations are indicative
  of relative band intensity of DNMTs expression in MDA-MB-231 cells, normalized with
  β-actin. Values are mean band intensity of three independent blot ± SD.





  It is well known that histone modifications and DNA methylation play important roles
  in gene expression and regulation, especially in ERα activation in breast cancer
  cells , . Our studies have shown that treatment with the GTPs and SFN significantly
  altered the activity as well as expression of epigenetic modulating enzymes in ERα-negative
  MDA-MB-231 cells, suggesting a potential role of histone modifications and DNA methylation
  in ERα regulations. Therefore, we sought to determine changes in histone modifications
  of the ERα promoter by GTPs and SFN treatment by different time intervals in MDA-MB-231
  cells. We found that GTPs and SFN treatment can increase considerable enrichment
  of three histone acetylation chromatin markers, acetyl H3, acetyl-H3 at lysine 9
  and ac-H4 in MDA-MB-231 cells after 48 h of post-treatment. We also found a decrease
  in the methylation status of inactive histone markers such as trimethyl-H3 lysine
  9 in MDA-MB-231 cells with GTPs and SFN treatments. Further, a significantly enriched
  level of histone acetylation and decreased tri-me-H3K9 was more pronounced in the
  combination treatments of GTPs and SFN at 48 h and 72 h, suggesting the importance
  of dietary combination-induced ERα-reactivation in ERα-negative breast cancer cells
  through histone modifications. These changes of histone acetylation and deacetylation
  allow transcriptional factors binding into the ER regulatory region by maintaining
  a repressive environment , .






  Figure 4.  GTPs and SFN altered ERα promoter methylation and histone acetylations
  in MDA-MB-231 cells.


  A) MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with GTPs and SFN alone, and in combinations as
  indicated for 24, 48 and 72 h. Histone modifications were analyzed by ChIP-qPCR
  using chromatin markers including acetyl-H3, trimethyl-H3K9, acetyl-H3K9 and acetyl-H4
  in the promoter region of ERα. Mouse IgG antibody controls were assessed to verify
  the ChIP efficiency. The x-axis represents the different treatment groups, and the
  y-axis represents the relative enrichment of individual binding factors . The experiment
  was repeated 3 times with triplicates in real-time PCR, and each point indicates
  the mean ± SD. Significance against nontreated MDA-MB-231 control, P&lt;0.05. B)
  GTPs and SFN altered ERα promoter DNA methylation in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells
  as assayed by bisulfite sequencing. MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with the indicated
  concentration of GTPs and SFN for 24 h, 48 h and 72 h. Percent methylation was obtained
  by dividing the number of methylated CpGs by the total number of CpGs in the indicated
  ERα promoter region assessed. Values are representative of three independent experiments
  and are represented as percent control ± SD; statistical significance, P&lt;0.05.
  C) The ERα promoter region used for bisulfite sequencing is shown with PCR primer
  sequences, number of CpGs and the total amplification lengths.



  Since the ERα promoter is mostly hypermethylated in ERα-negative breast cancer cells,
  we assessed the methylation status of the ERa promoter region from −66 to +356 covering
  29 CpG dinucleotides and various overlapping transcription factor binding sites
  for 24 h, 48 h and 72 h. We used bisulfite-sequencing to detect the ERa methylation
  patterns of GTPs and SFN treated MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells. Untreated
  MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells served as controls. As shown in Fig. 4B, control MDA-MB-231
  breast cancer cells maintain a high level of methylation at promoter sites at 54.02±2.36%.
  Although we found considerable inhibition in DNMTs expression levels with GTPs and
  SFN treatments, we did not find any significant changes in methylation status of
  the ERα promoter with GTPs and SFN treated MDA-MB-231 compared with untreated MDA-MB-231
  cells. This is in accordance with our previous study that EGCG treatment does not
  induce significant methylation changes in the CpG islands of the ERα promoter in
  MDA-MB-231 cells . In contrast, combination treatments of GTPs with SFN significantly
  reduced ERα promoter methylation after 48 h post-treatment as we observed previously
  in combination of EGCG with Trichostatin A, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, in
  MDA-MB-231 cells . Our results indicated that only combined treatments of GTPs and
  SFN can induce significant DNA hypomethylation at the ERα promoter. In summary,
  these results suggest that histone modifications and DNA methylation contribute
  a major role in GTPs and SFN induced ERα reactivation in ERα-negative human breast
  cancer cells.




  Given the strong link between histone modification and DNA methylation, we asked
  whether GTP- and SFN-induced ERα re-expression is associated with reorganization
  of heterochromatin structure at the epigenetically regulated ERα promoter in MDA-MB-231
  cells. Studies have shown that HDAC repressor complex, HDAC1 and DNMT1 involves
  gene silencing by recruiting co-repressor complexes to the methylated ERα promoter
  . Studies have also shown that disruption of transcriptional repressor multi-molecular
  complex, HDAC1/DNMT1/SUV39H1, is associated with ERα transcriptional activation
  in ERα-negative breast cancer cells . Therefore, ChIP-assays were performed to examine
  GTPs- and SFN-mediated changes in these transcriptional repressor complexes binding
  on the ERα promoter. As shown in Fig. 5A–B, GTPs and SFN can considerably lower
  the binding of these transcriptional repressor multi-molecular complexes to the
  ERα promoter and this effect was significant when treated with GTPs and SFN in combinations.
  Further, GTPs and SFN combination treatment also significantly disrupted binding
  of methyl-CpG binding domain proteins, MeCP2 and MBD1, to the ERα promoter, might
  be due to the hypomethylation induced by GTPs and SFN at the ERα promoter. Collectively,
  these data suggest that the binding alterations of transcriptional repressor complex
  to the ERα promoter contributed to the reactivation of ERα by the combination of
  dietary DNMT and HDAC inhibitors, GTPs and SFN, respectively.

  A) MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with GTPs or SFN and a combination of both of the
  compounds as indicated for 3 days. Samples were prepared for ChIP-assay and analyzed
  for the binding of ERα transcription repressor proteins including HDAC1, DNMT1,
  MeCP2, MBD1 and SUV39H1 together with mouse IgG control. MCF-7 served as a positive
  control. PCR primers and conditions were used as described in Materials and Methods.
  Photographs are representative of an experiment that was repeated in triplicates.
  B) ChIP data were calculated from the corresponding DNA fragments amplified by PCR
  using Kodak 1D 3.6.1 image software; columns, mean; bars, SD; statistical significance,
  P&lt;0.05. The relative binding ratio was calculated as the ratio between the net
  intensity of each bound sample divided by the input and the untreated control sample
  divided by the input/(control/input).





  Studies have shown that EGCG can induce hypomethylation in various cell lines either
  by direct or indirect inhibition of DNA methyltransferases , , . We previously discovered
  that SFN can also induce hypomethylation at the regulatory region of hTERT through
  inhibition of DNMTs expressions . Therefore, we sought to determine the cause of
  GTPs and SFN treatment on global methylation status in ERα-negative MDA-MB-231 cells.
  We performed 5-methyl-cytosine immunostaining and dot-blot analysis to examine GTPs
  and SFN altered global methylation in MDA-MB-231 cells. As shown in Fig. 6A, GTPs-treatment
  considerably reduced 5-mC positive staining compared with control cells. The effect
  of demethylation was predominant in combination treatment of GTPs with SFN in MDA-MB-231
  cells. The results were further semi-quantitatively analyzed by dot-blot analysis.
  Treatment of GTPs resulted in a significant reduction in 5-mC levels in MDA-MB-231
  cells compared with untreated MDA-MB-231 cells. However, combined treatment of GTPs
  with SFN significantly reduced 5-mC expression in MDA-MB-231 cells, resulting in
  a synergistic global hypomethylation in CpG dinuclotides. These results suggest
  that GTPs may have a broad effect on DNA demethylation and this might be further
  accelerated by combination with SFN as observed in this study.

  Collectively our aforementioned observations conclude that the combination of dietary
  DNMT and HDAC inhibitors, GTPs and SFN, respectively, epigenetically reactivates
  ERα expression in ERα-negative MDA-MB-231 cells. Furthermore, we sought to determine
  whether the ERα-reactivation could be used along with available SERMs such as tamoxifen
  therapy in hormonal refractory breast cancer. We therefore investigated the changes
  in cellular viability and apoptosis in ERα-negative MDA-MB-231 cells treated with
  GTPs and SFN alone or in combinations along with tamoxifen. As shown in Fig. 7A,
  untreated MDA-MB-231 cells showed an increased cellular proliferation with 17β-estradiol,
  an ERα-ligand activator. Treatments with GTPs and 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine, a DNMT
  inhibitor, alone or in combinations with TAM did not inhibit significant cellular
  proliferation in MDA-MB-231 cells, which is likely due to the limited ERα reactivations.
  However, MDA-MB-231 cells treated with SFN and TSA combined with TAM had significantly
  reduced cellular proliferation, likely due to the pronounced effect of histone modifications
  as well as DNA demethylation-mediated ERα activation in MDA-MB-231 cells. Furthermore,
  combined treatment of GTP and SFN with TAM showed a significantly greater effect
  in reducing cellular proliferation in ERα-negative MDA-MB-231 cells. GTPs and SFN
  combined with TAM had pronounced cellular proliferation inhibitory effect than the
  combination of synthetic DNMT inhibitor, AZC, and HDAC inhibitor, TSA, along with
  TAM. It was found that MDA-MB-231 cells treated with 20 µg/mL GTPs and 10 µM SFN
  induced a considerable level of cellular apoptosis in both control as well as ERα-knockdown
  cells. Furthermore, combined treatment with GTP and SFN showed a significantly higher
  apoptosis in both control siRNA as well as ERα-knockdown siRNA cells. MDA-MB-231
  cells treated with GTPs and SFN combined with TAM had significantly higher cellular
  apoptosis. Conversely, ERα knockdown MDA-MB-231 cells treated with GTPs and SFN
  combined with TAM induced a significantly lesser apoptosis than control siRNA treated
  MDA-MB-231 cells. This might be the fact that GTPs and SFN induced cellular apoptosis
  in MDA-MB-231 cells in both ERα-dependent as well as ERα-independent mechanisms.
  However, TAM required ERα-reactivation to induce significant level of apoptosis
  in ERα-negative MDA-MB-231 cells at the low dose used. Collectively, these results
  indicated that the combination of GTPs and SFN can induce functional ERα re-expression
  and re-sensitize ERα-negative breast cancer cells to available SERM, TAM, which
  could provide an extremely important clinical implication in potential application
  of combination of bioactive dietary supplements as a therapeutic strategy for hormonal
  refractory breast cancer.

  three separate experiments.





  Epigenetic regulation has attracted considerable interest as a molecular target
  for cancer prevention and therapy as well as a target of many bioactive dietary
  components. Growing evidence suggests that bioactive dietary components impact epigenetic
  processes often involved with silencing of tumor suppressor genes, activation of
  cell survival proteins and induction of cellular apoptosis in many types of cancer
  , , , . GTPs and SFN have been found to have anti-cancer properties in various cancers
  through genetic and epigenetic mechanisms , , , . The most abundant bioactive compound
  present in GTPs is catechins, which include-epicatechin,-epicatechin-3-gallate,-epigallocatechin
  and-epigallocatechin-3-gallate , . Of these, EGCG accounts for more than 50% of
  the total polyphenol and effective content in green tea . EGCG, a well studied green
  tea polyphenol, has DNMTs inhibitory activity, however, other catechins in GTPs
  such as-epicatechin,-epicatechin-3-gallate and-epigallocatechin have also been found
  to share similar properties although they are less efficient than EGCG , . Therefore,
  the use of GTPs as a whole not only mimics the natural environment but also enhances
  its synergistic epigenetic activity against various cancers including breast cancer.
  Another bioactive dietary supplement used in this study is sulforaphane, an isothiocyanate
  naturally abundant in widely consumed cruciferous vegetables, found to have HDACs
  inhibitory activity , . Therefore the focus of the current study is the use of combined
  dietary DNMT and HDAC inhibitors for the prevention and therapeutics of hormonal
  refractory breast cancer.


  The epigenetics of ERα re-expression in ERα-negative breast cancer cells has been
  studied in many laboratories, including our laboratory, and has been of intense
  interest as a novel strategy for the treatment of hormonal refractory breast cancer
  , , . Since ERα-negative tumors are difficult to treat with available SERMs due
  to the lack of hormonal receptor, it is very crucial to formulate a new treatment
  strategy for this type of hormonal refractory breast cancer. Many studies have advanced
  our knowledge that treatment with AZC, a DNMT inhibitor, and TSA, a HDAC inhibitor,
  can reactivate ER expression in ER-negative breast cancer cells, suggesting that
  epigenetic mechanisms play an important role in ERα transcriptional regulations
  , , . However, the use of synthetic molecules might induce potential adverse side
  effects and higher cost. Therefore, the use of bioactive dietary supplements as
  DNMT and HDAC inhibitors for the reactivation of ER-expression in ER-negative breast
  cancer could greatly mimic more natural dietary milieu, reduced treatment cost and
  most importantly minimum adverse effects.


  In the present study, we provided evidences that the combination of GTPs and SFN
  can induce re-expression of endogenous ERα in ERα-negative MDA-MB-231 human breast
  cancer cells. For the first time, our results demonstrate that the reactivation
  of ERα by GTPs and SFN is mediated, at least partly, through the epigenetic alterations
  in DNA methylation and chromatin remodeling in ERα gene promoter. Recent evidences
  suggest that epigenetic regulation is one of the most important molecular events
  associated with ERα silencing in ERα-negative breast cancers , , . Recently, extensive
  studies have focused on EGCG, a major component in GTPs, mediated DNMTs and HAT
  inhibitory activity in various cancer cells, including breast cancer cells , , .
  Besides direct inhibition of DNMT by EGCG, it was also reported that consumption
  of GTPs could lead to a decrease in available S-adenosyl-L-methionine and an increase
  in S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine and homocysteine levels, thereby providing evidence
  of an indirect inhibition of DNA methylation by EGCG/GTPs . This conjecture is supported
  by animal studies demonstrating that GTPs consumption through drinking water can
  moderately decrease the level of SAM in the intestine . Beside HDAC inhibitory activity
  of SFN, we also observed DNMTs inhibitory activity in human breast cancer cells.
  This is in accordance with earlier findings that SFN-treatment significantly inhibited
  HDAC activity and DNMTs expression in breast cancer cells; however, we did not find
  any significant alteration in HAT activity .


  Several studies have reported that DNA methylation and histone acetylation play
  important roles in ER transcriptional regulation –, . Together, our results suggest
  that GTPs and SFN-induced down-regulation of DNMTs expression and histone modifications
  is not only causing a repressive environment at the ERα promoter but also altered
  the binding of transcriptional repressor complex at the ERα promoter. This is confirmed
  further with our ChIP-analysis that GTPs- and SFN-induced enrichment of transcriptional
  active chromatin markers such as acetylated histone H3, H3K9 and acetyl-H4 in ER-negative
  MDA-MB-231 cells, whereas chromatin inactive markers such as trimethyl-H3K9 was
  decreased. Importantly, we found that the histone H3K9 methyltransferase, SUV39H1,
  was released from the ER-promoter since presence of SUV39H1 has been shown to be
  crucial for maintenance of the H3-methylation and epigenetic control of heterochromatin
  assembly in cancer cells , . In accordance, we found that GTPs- and SFN-mediated
  release of SUV39H1 protein from ER promoter leads to suppression of trimethyl-H3K9
  methylation in ER-negative MDA-MB-231 cells.


  Studies have shown that CpG methylation of the ERα promoter results in transcriptional
  ER silencing . We found that bioactive dietary DNA demethylating and histone deacetylating
  agents such as GTPs and SFN can alter the binding of methyl-CpG binding proteins,
  DNMT and HDAC, which are actively involved in ERα transcriptional regulations ,
  . Further our results demonstrate that combinations of GTPs and SFN induced the
  release of co-repressor complexes to the demethylated ERα promoter and the disruption
  of transcriptional repressor multi-molecular complex, HDAC1/DNMT1/SUV39H1, is actively
  associated with ERα transcriptional activation in ERα-negative breast cancer cells
  . Further, it is also reported that release of co-repressor complex leads to concomitant
  enrichment of ac-H3, ac-H3K9 and ac-H4 . Besides gene specific DNA demethylations,
  we also observed a global DNA hypomethylation by GTPs and SFN in MDA-MB-231 cells.
  This might be due to the GTPs- and SFN-mediated DNMTs inhibition in these human
  breast cancer cells , , . Taken together, it is apparent that DNMTs-induced promoter
  demethylation and HDAC-associated chromatin remodelling altered binding of transcriptional
  repressor multi-molecular complex, which is closely, linked to the ERα re-activation
  by GTPs and SFN in ERα-negative human breast cancer cells.


  In our potential application study, we have clearly demonstrated that GTPs and SFN-mediated
  ERα-reactivation can be utilized for the treatment with available SERMs, tamoxifen
  in ERα-negative breast cancer cells. For the first time we demonstrated that the
  combination of bioactive dietary supplements, GTPs and SFN can reactivate ERα-expression
  in ERα-negative breast cancer cells through DNA demethylation and histone modifications
  associated epigenetic alterations. These findings are of importance not only for
  understanding epigenetic regulation of the ERα gene but also to provide evidence
  for the combined anticancer mechanism of bioactive dietary DNMT and HDAC inhibitors
  in cancer prevention and therapy.


  In conclusion, our results suggest that the combination of dietary bioactive supplements
  GTPs and SFN could enhance the possible novel treatment strategy for hormonal refractory
  breast tumors. Further, epigenetic regulation of ERα re-activation by combination
  of GTPs and SFN could help in designing novel therapeutic strategies. However, further
  studies with in vivo transgenic models such as C3(1)/SV40 and Her2/neu are necessary
  to validate our observations during different stages of breast cancer progression.
  These in vivo mouse models can produce ER-negative breast tumors which closely resemble
  the development, progression and morphology of human breast tumors , . These in
  vivo models can be manipulated to use for ER-reactivation studies by potential bioactive
  dietary supplements with more close resemblance to humans for the treatment of hormonal
  refractory breast cancer in combination with available SERMs.
