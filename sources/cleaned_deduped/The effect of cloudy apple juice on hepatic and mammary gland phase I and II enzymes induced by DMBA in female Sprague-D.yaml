  Apples abundant in phenolic compounds show a variety of biological activities that
  may contribute to health beneficial effects against cardiovascular diseases, diabetes,
  obesity and cancer. We investigated the effect of cloudy apple juice on the hepatic
  and mammary gland carcinogen metabolizing enzymes, DNA damage and liver injury,
  altered by 7,12-dimethylbenzanthracene. Sprague-Dawley female rats were gavaged
  with CAJ for 28 consecutive days. DMBA was administered i.p. on the 27th and the
  28th days. In the liver, feeding with CAJ decreased the activities of CYP1A1 and
  1A2 and increased phase II enzymes. The activities of all enzymes tested were enhanced
  in the animals treated with DMBA alone and in combination with CAJ. The most significant
  changes in the level of the hepatic enzymes tested were observed for GST alpha and
  NQO1. In mammary gland CAJ induced an increase in the level of GST mu and GST pi,
  while DMBA and CAJ combined administration elevated GST pi only. This may be beneficial
  as GST pi is involved in the DMBA detoxification. Additionally, pretreatment with
  CAJ reduced the level of most of the blood biochemical liver and kidney markers
  elevated as a result of DMBA treatment. These findings indicate that CAJ may interfere
  with enzyme system involved in carcinogen metabolism. However, this effect seems
  to be dependent on tissue and carcinogen and is moderately effective in the case
  of DMBA. Moreover, CAJ can also provide some protection against the liver and kidney
  damage.'
