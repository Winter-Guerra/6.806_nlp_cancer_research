  This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of dietary genistein on broiler
  immune system. A corn-soybean meal basal diet was supplemented with five genistein
  levels in a completely randomised design with 5 replicates of 10 birds. Dietary
  control treatments were included the negative control diet with no feed additive
  supplementation and two positive control groups supplemented with either virginiamycin
  or zinc bacitracin. Three hundred and fifty day-old male broiler chicks were fed
  with the experimental diets from 1 to 42 days of age. On days 13 and 23, chicks
  were vaccinated against Newcastle disease virus and infectious bronchitis virus
  disease, respectively. The 10 chicks from each dietary treatment were bled on day
  6 and 12 after vaccinations. Sera samples were use in hemagglutination inhibition
  test for NDV and ELISA test for IBV. Dietary supplementation with 20 mg/kg Gn caused
  increases in antibody titres against Newcastle and infectious bronchitis diseases
  viruses at day 12 after vaccine administration. However, diet modifications had
  no significant effect on blood leukocyte sub-populations and heterophil to lymphocyte
  ratio. The present results suggest that dietary supplementation with genistein especially
  at the levels of 20 and 40 mg/kg can improve immunological responses of broiler
  chicks.'
