  buckwheat water-soluble extracts. The objective of this paper was to investigate
  the anti-proliferative effects of TBWSP31 on breast cancer Bcap37cells and to explore
  its possible mechanism. After treatment of Bcap37 cells with TBWSP31, typical apoptotic
  morphological changes were observed by inverted microscopy and scanning electron
  microscopy, such as detachment from the culture plate, change to a round shape,
  cell shrinkage, the absence of obvious microvilli, plasma membrane blebbing, and
  formation of apoptotic bodies. Cell-cycle analysis revealed that treatment with
  TBWSP31 resulted in a G0/G1 arrest and prevented the cells from growing from G0/G1
  phase to S phase, which was most prominent at 48 h. The expression of bcl-2 and
  Fas were detected quantitatively by FCM, which showed that TBWSP31 induced-apoptosis
  may be involved with the participation of Fas and bcl-2. These results suggest that
  TBWSP31 is a potential antitumor compound and that apoptosis induced by TBWSP31
  is a key antitumor mechanism. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe genus Fagopyrum has about 15 species
  distributed in different parts of the world . Among these species, only two types
  of buckwheat are used as food around the world: common buckwheat and tartary buckwheat
  .\n\nTartary buckwheat grain, as an important functional food material, is commonly
  taken in the diet in eastern Asian countries . It is well known that tartary buckwheat
  contains higher rutin and vitamins B1, B2, and B6 content than common buckwheat
  . In China, tartary buckwheat is mainly grown in some mountainous regions, such
  as Liang Shan Yi Autonomous region in Sichuan province and Jing Zhou in Gui Zhou
  province .\n\nBuckwheat protein has high biological value due to a well-balanced
  amino acid pattern and is rich in lysine and arginine. Recently, the physiological
  properties of buckwheat protein have also been studied. In rat feeding experiments,
  studies have proven that buckwheat protein extract has hypocholesterolemic , anticonstipation
  \ and antiobesity activities . In addition, Liu et al.  reported that buckwheat
  protein product had a protective effect against 1,2-dimethyhydrazine-induced colon
  carcinogenesis in rats by reducing cell proliferation. Kayashita et al. reported
  that consumption of the buckwheat protein extract retarded 7,12-dimetylbenz anthracene-induced
  mammary carcinogenesis in rats .\n\nA tumor is a disease state characterized by
  uncontrolled proliferation and a loss of apoptosis. Cell proliferation and death
  are involved in the maintenance of homeostasis in normal tissues, and cell death
  is often inhibited in tumors with a higher cell proliferation rate . Apoptosis is
  the process of programmed cell death through a tightly controlled program that plays
  important roles in many normal processes, ranging from fetal development to adult
  tissue homeostasis . Thus, modulating apoptosis may be useful in the management
  and therapy or prevention of cancer. Apoptotic induction has been a new target for
  innovative mechanism based drug discovery. Compounds that block or suppress the
  proliferation of tumor cells by inducing apoptosis are considered to have potential
  as antitumor agents . Apoptosis and necrosis are two different types of cell death
  via distinct morphological and biochemical processes .\n\nBreast cancer is the most
  common cancer affecting women worldwide. It accounts for approximately 25% of all
  female malignancies with a higher prevalence in developed countries. Incidence rates
  continue to increase especially in the USA, Canada, the Nordic countries, Singapore
  and Japan, with over one million new cases reported each year worldwide . An attractive
  method for breast carcinoma chemotherapy is the use of pharmaceutical agents that
  induce death of breast tumor cells to overcome proliferation. It is important to
  screen apoptotic inducers from plants, either in the form of crude extracts or as
  components isolated from them.\n\nIn our previous study, the effective antitumor
  protein was isolated and purified from Chinese tartary buckwheat water-soluble extracts,
  and the antitumor mechanism of TBWSP31 was not clearly elucidated . The antitumor
  effect of TBWSP31 was determined by MTT assay and we tested a number of different
  cell lines, such as Bel-7402, SGC-7901, MDA-MB-231, Bcap37, MCF-7 and KB. Of the
  cancer cells tested, the most sensitive tumor cell to TBWSP31 was the human mammary
  cancer cell. The main objective of this study was to investigate the mechanism underlying
  the anti-tumor effect of TBWSP31 on the human breast cancer cell line Bcap37 and
  to explore whether the effect is mediated via an apoptotic mechanism. In this paper,
  morphological changes of Bcap37 cells were observed by inverted microscopy and scanning
  electron microscopy. Furthermore, the cell cycle and the expression of bcl-2 and
  Fas were analyzed using flow cytometry.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1 shows the effect of
  TBWSP31 treatment on Bcap37 cells as a growth curve. The dynamic change of Bcap37
  cell proliferation in the presence of TBWSP31 is reflected by the cells’ growth
  curve. The effect of TBWSP31 treatment on Bcap37 cell growth was determined using
  the trypan blue exclusion test after 96 h of incubation. As shown in Figure 1, the
  number of living untreated Bcap37 cells increased linearly with the increase of
  incubation time. However, when Bcap37 cells were treated with 200 μg/mL of TBWSP31,
  the living cell number scarcely increased over the length of the experiment. The
  cells treated with 100 μg/mL of TBWSP31 showed slow growth and the cell growth curve
  reached a plateau before the incubation time reached 72 h. Furthermore, the number
  of living Bcap37 cells treated with 50 μg/mL increased until the incubation time
  of 72 h had been reached, and then decreased, which indicated that the inhibitory
  effect of TBWSP31 on Bcap37 cell proliferation was not due to direct killing of
  Bcap37 cells. In this part, we only investigated the effect of higher doses of TBWSP31
  on the growth of Bcap37 cells. The inhibition effect of lower concentrations of
  TBWSP31 on the proliferation of Bcap37 cells was assessed by colorimetric MTT-assay
  in our previous study. For the rest of the current paper, lower concentrations of
  TBWSP31 were used because Flow cytometry analysis needed a minimum amount of cells
  per experimental condition.\n\n\n\nFigure 2 shows the morphology changes of Bcap37
  cells after treatment with TBWSP31 as observed by inverted microscopy. Bcap37 cells
  were cultured with 0 or 10 μg/mL of TBWSP31 for 24 h. Under an inverted microscope,
  cell shape and changes can be clearly observed. As shown in Figure 2A, cells in
  the control group showed adherent growth and a regular polygon shape, with very
  few round cells. The growth speed of the control Bcap37 cells was higher than that
  of the TBWSP31-treated cells, indicating that TBWSP31 inhibited Bcap37 cell proliferation.
  Compared to the control, marked morphological changes were observed in the cells
  treated with 10 μg/mL of TBWSP31 for 24 h. The adherent ability of Bcap37 cells
  became worse and the shape became round. Additionally, only few cells remained attached
  and the number of floating smaller cells increased in the medium after 24 h incubation
  with 10 μg/mL of TBWSP31, indicating the possibility of apoptosis occurrence .\n\n\n\nTo
  further investigate whether TBWSP31 mediated cell death of Bcap37 cells is due to
  an apoptotic mechanism, the surface morphological changes that occurred with 20
  μg/mL of TBWSP31 treatment for 48 h were observed under SEM. Figure 3 shows the
  morphological changes of Bcap37 cells observed by SEM.\n\nThe control group showed
  untreated cells with numerous microvilli over the surface of the cells and intact
  cells. In contrast, cells treated with TBWSP31 exhibited a significant decrease
  in the number of microvilli and an apparent deformation. The surface of Bcap37 cells
  became relatively smooth with no obvious microvilli, and some irregular blebs and
  apoptotic bodies were seen in cell membranes after treatment. Membrane blebbing
  is one of a series of distinctive morphological events during apoptosis. It has
  been reported to be associated with cytoplasmic and nuclear manifestations of apoptosis
  . Highly conserved morphological changes, including membrane blebbing and cell shrinkage,
  have been used as morphological criteria to identify apoptotic cell death . Cell
  shrinkage and plasma membrane blebbing could be observed after incubation of Bcap37
  cells with TBWSP31. Treatment of Bcap37 cells with TBWSP31 resulted in significant
  morphological alterations, which are typical characteristics of apoptosis.\n\n\n\nTable
  1 shows the effect of TBWSP31 on the percentage of Bcap37cells present in each cell
  cycle phase. After 24 h incubation with 0, 5 and 10 μg/mL of TBWSP31, the cell population
  in the G0/G1 phase was 53.6%, 57.3% and 68.4%, the cell population in S phase was
  33.5%, 31.4% and 28.9%, and the cell population in G2/M phase was 12.9%, 11.3% and
  2.7%, respectively. After 48 h incubation with 5 and 10 μg/mL of TBWSP31, the cell
  population in the G0/G1 phase increased to 70.9% and 77.6%, and the cell population
  in S phase decreased to 28.5% and 21.8%, respectively. These results showed that
  TBWSP31 could inhibit the growth of Bcap37 cells through a cell cycle arrest in
  the G0/G1 phase, and prevent the cells growing from G0/G1 phase to S phase. In addition,
  the inhibition effect of TBWSP31 on the proliferation of Bcap37 cells existed in
  a dose- and time-dependent manner.\n\n\n\nThe effect of TBWSP31 on the levels of
  bcl-2 and Fas proteins in Bcap37 cells is shown in Figure 4. The level of bcl-2
  decreased dramatically from 71.5% to 46.7% and 32.3% when Bcap37 cells were treated
  with 5 μg/mL and 10 μg/mL of TBWSP31, respectively. In contrast, the levels of Fas
  protein increased significantly after TBWSP31 treatment: from 2.83% to 13.3% and
  27.0%. These results showed that TBWSP31 treatment induced a significant decrease
  of bcl-2 expression and increase of Fas expression after 48 h in a dose-dependent
  manner. Cell apoptosis is regulated by anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic effectors,
  involving a large number of biomolecules. Bcl-2 is known to be an upstream effector
  molecule in the apoptotic pathway and is identified as a potent suppressor of apoptosis
  . Fas protein, a glycosylated 45-kD transmembrane receptor, belongs to the tumor
  necrosis factor receptor family and induces apoptosis . In the present study, the
  expression of bcl-2 was down-regulated and the expression of Fas was up-regulated.
  The changes of these proteins-correlated apoptosis expressions suggested that TBWSP31
  induced-apoptosis may be involved with the participation of Fas and Bcl-2.\n\n\n\n\n\nTartary
  buckwheat flour was obtained from the milling factory for minor crops in Liang Shan
  region in Sichuan province. Flour was defatted for 24 h with n-hexane under continuous
  stirring, air-dried at room temperature, and stored at 4 °C until used.\n\n\n\nTBWSP31
  was isolated from tartary buckwheat water-soluble extracts and purified by DEAE-Sepharose
  FF anion exchange, Sephadex G-100 gel filtration and Sephacryl S-200 gel filtration
  column chromatography.\n\n\n\nHuman breast cancer cell culture was maintained in
  RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in maximal humidity
  atmosphere containing 5% CO2.\n\n\n\nThe effect of TBWSP31 treatment on Bcap37 cells
  growth was determined by the trypan blue exclusion test . Bcap37 cells were plated
  in 24-well culture plates at 5 × 104 cells/well and were treated with serial dilutions
  of TBWSP31 in quadruplicate. Wells containing different dilutions were selected
  to be counted every 24 h and cells that excluded trypan blue were counted in a Neubauer
  chamber. The growth curve of Bcap37 cells was drawn according to their average value.\n\n\n\nBcap37
  cells were seeded in RPMI-1640 containing 10% FBS and treated with 0 and 10 μg/mL
  of TBWSP31 for 24 h. The cellular morphology was directly observed using an inverted
  microscope at the indicated times.\n\n\n\nBcap37 cells were seeded in RPMI-1640
  containing 10% FBS and treated with 0 and 20 μg/mL of TBWSP31 for 48 h. After incubation,
  cells were collected and fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde at 4 °C for SEM analysis .
  Fixed cells were rinsed in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.2 and post-fixed with 1%
  osmium tetroxide. Cells were rinsed in phosphate buffer and dehydrated in a graded
  ethanol series of 30, 50, 70, 90, 100% for 20 min. Cells were then critical point-dried
  from CO2 in a critical point dryer. The dried cells were affixed to an aluminum
  stub with double-stick tape, coated with gold in an ionic sputter coater. They were
  viewed and photographed by scanning electronic microscopy.\n\n\n\nBcap37 cells were
  seeded in RPMI-1640 containing 10% FBS and treated with 0, 5 and 10 μg/mL of TBWSP31
  for 24 h and 48 h. Cell cycle analysis was performed using a hypotonic solution
  of propidium iodide. Approximate 1 × 106 cells per experimental condition were harvested,
  washed with cold PBS twice and fixed with 70% ice-cold ethanol at −20 °C. After
  fixation, cells were washed twice with PBS, then incubated with 100 μg/mL RNase
  A for 30 min at 37 °C and stained with 100 μg/mL propidium iodide for 30 min at
  room temperature. DNA fluorescence was measured in a Becton Dickinson flow cytometer,
  and the percentages of cells in G0/G1, S, and G2/M phases of the cell cycle were
  determined using the CellFIT software.\n\n\n\nBcap37 cells were seeded in RPMI-1640
  containing 10% FBS and treated with 0, 5 and 10 μg/mL of TBWSP31 for 48 h. After
  incubation, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 30
  min, washed with PBS, and then permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100. The cells were
  then incubated in PBS with either bcl-2 or Fas for 30 min at 37 °C. After two washes,
  the cells were incubated in PBS with the secondary FITC-conjugated goat anti-rat
  IgG for an additional 30 min at 4 °C in the dark. Subsequently, the cells were washed
  twice with PBS and analyzed by flow cytometry.\n\n\n\nStatistical analyses were
  performed using the SAS 8.1 software package. Statistical significance was determined
  by analysis of variance.\n\n\n\nIn this work we investigated the antitumor mechanism
  of TBWSP31 on the human breast cancer cell line Bcap37 by inverted microscopy, scanning
  electron microscopy and flow cytometry. Typical apoptotic morphological changes
  were observed after incubation of Bcap37 cells with TBWSP31, such as detachment
  from the culture plate, no obvious microvilli, plasma membrane blebbing, and formation
  of apoptotic bodies. Cell-cycle analysis revealed that treatment with TBWSP31 resulted
  in G0/G1 arrest and prevented the cells from growing from G0/G1 phase to S phase.
  The expression of bcl-2 and Fas were detected quantitatively by FCM, which showed
  that TBWSP31 induced-apoptosis may be involved with up-regulation of Fas expression
  and down-regulation of bcl-2 expression. From the above facts, we conclude that
  TBWSP31 could inhibit the growth of Bcap37 cells via induction of apoptosis.\n\nThis
