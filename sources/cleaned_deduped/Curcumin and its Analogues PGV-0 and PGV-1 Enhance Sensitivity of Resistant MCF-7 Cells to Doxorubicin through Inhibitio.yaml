  Chemoresistance of breast cancer to doxorubicin is mediated mainly through activation
  of NF-kB and over expression of HER2. Curcumin and its analogues exert cytotoxic
  effects on T47D breast cancer cells. Suppression of NF-kB activation is suggested
  to contribute to this activity. The present study aimed to explore the effects of
  curcumin, PGV-0, and PGV-1 singly and in combination with doxorubicin on MCF-7/Dox
  cells featuring over-expression of HER2. In MTT assays, curcumin, PGV-0, and PGV-1
  showed cytotoxicity effects against MCF-7/Dox with IC50 values of 80 μM, 21 μM,
  and 82 μM respectively. These compounds increased MCF-7/Dox sensitivity to doxorubicin.
  Cell cycle distribution analysis exhibited that the combination of curcumin and
  its analogues with Dox increased sub G-1 cell populations. Curcumin and PGV-1 but
  not PGV-0 decreased localization of p65 into the nucleus induced by Dox, indicating
  that activation of NF- kB was inhibited. Molecular docking of curcumin, PGV-0, and
  PGV-1 demonstrated high affinity to HER2 at ATP binding site. This interaction were
  directly comparable with those of ATP and lapatinib. These findings suggested that
  curcumin, PGV-0 and PGV-1 enhance the Dox cytotoxicity to MCF-7 cells through inhibition
  of HER2 activity and NF-kB activation. '
