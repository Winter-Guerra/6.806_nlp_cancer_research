  activities. Explants of young black carrot shoots were cultured in Murashige and
  Skoog medium for callus initiation and were transferred to new MS medium supplemented
  with four different combinations of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and kinetin.
  Subsequently, the lyophilized calli and black carrot harvested from fields were
  subjected to ultrasound extraction with ethanol at a ratio of 1:15. Obtained extracts
  were applied to various human cancer cell lines including MCF-7 SK-BR-3 and MDA-MB-231,
  HT-29, PC-3, Neuro 2A cancer cell lines and VERO normal cell line by MTT assay.
  The highest cytotoxic activity was achieved against Neuro-2A cell lines exhibiting
  viability of 38–46 % at 6.25 μg/ml concentration for all calli and natural extracts.
  However, a significantly high IC50 value of 170.13 μg/ml was attained in normal
  cell line VERO indicating that its natural counterpart is an ideal candidate for
  treatment of brain cancer without causing negative effects to normal healthy cells.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAntioxidants
  provide protection to human against infections and degenerative diseases by inhibiting
  and scavenging free radicals . The natural occurrence of antioxidants is directly
  related to phenolic contents of fruits and vegetables. Thus, extensive research
  efforts are directed towards natural antioxidants originated from plants due to
  safe therapeutics .\n\nBlack carrots originating from Turkey, Middle and Far East,
  have very high anthocyanin contents  which are the most abundant group of pigments
  responsible for the red, blue, and purple colors of vegetables and fruits  and are
  of prime importance to human well-being as they are well distinguished for their
  role in health promotion and aging-related diseases including cancer, cardio- and
  cerebrovascular diseases . Additionally, extracts of black carrots gain importance
  alternatives to synthetic colorants being less toxic, more heat and pH stable food
  colorant .\n\nIt is reported that black carrots have high anthocyanin content up
  to 1750 mg/kg fresh weight  and mainly consist of acylated cyanidin-based anthocyanins
  namely cyanidin 3-sinapoyl-xylosyl-glucosyl-galactoside and cyanidin 3-feruloyl-xylosyl-glucosyl-galactoside
  . The anthocyanin derivatives in black carrots proved to exhibit antioxidant and
  anti-inflammatory activities . Especially, acylated cyanidin-based anthocyanins
  reduce NF-κB activation in endothelial cells and decrease nitric oxide production
  in macrophages . Anthocyanin-rich extract from black carrot significantly inhibited
  the growth of HT-29 colorectal adenocarcinoma and HL-60 promyelocytic leukaemia
  cells in vitro . Since carrots constitute one of the main components of human nutrition
  and attract attention to be used as functional food due to their high anthocyanin
  content , carrot callus cultures were also reported to possess antioxidant activity
  .\n\nIn this study, different medium compositions were investigated in order to
  increase the anthocyanin content of black carrot callus cultures. Thereafter, extracts
  of black carrot obtained by cell culture and harvested from fields were screened
  and compared in terms of antioxidant and cytotoxic activities against MCF-7, SK-BR-3,
  MDA-MB-231, HT-29, PC-3, Neuro 2A cancer cell lines, and VERO normal cell line.\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack
  carrot specimens were purchased from a local market in Kutahya. The specimens were
  dried at 30 °C and stored in the cold room.\n\n\n\nMurashige Skog basal salt mixture,
  MS vitamin power, kinetin, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, MTT  and etoposide were
  purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Folin-Ciocalteu’s reagent, 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazylhydrate,
  and sodium carbonate were obtained from Sigma, whereas gallic acid was from Fluka.
  The HPLC grade organic solvents, ethanol and methanol, were purchased from Merck.
  All other chemicals were of analytical grade purity. Nanopure water was prepared
  by using in-house nanopure water system.\n\n\n\nBlack carrot seeds were soaked in
  an ethanol solution 70 % for 5 min, then surface-sterilized in a 0.5 % sodium hypochlorite
  solution for 7 min and subsequently, washed with sterile water three times and then
  allowed to germinate for 2 weeks at 25 ± 2 °C on MS solid medium with 8 g/L of agar
  and 30 g/L sucrose. Hypocotyl explants without apical meristems were removed from
  the seedlings, cut into 0.5 cm segments and placed on MS solid medium with 0.1–0.5-1
  mg/L of 2,4-D, 30 g/L of sucrose and 8 g/L of agar for callus initiation. Finally,
  the explants were incubated at 25 ± 2 °C under continuous light of 2000 lux.\n\n\n\nAfter
  four weeks of inoculation explants were swelled and induction of callus started.
  Calli were transferred to new MS medium supplemented with 1 mg/L 2,4 D + 0.1 mg/L
  kinetin, 1 mg/L 2,4 D + 0.5 mg/L kinetin, 0.5 mg/L 2,4 D + 0.1 mg/L kinetin and
  0.5 mg/L 2,4 D + 0.5 mg/L kinetin. They were subcultured on the same medium four
  times with intervals of two weeks. The calli collected from each vessel were gently
  pressed on filter paper to remove excess water and their fresh weights were recorded.\n\n\n\nDried
  samples weighing 1 g were extracted ultrasonically with 15 ml ethanol for 15 min.
  The extraction was performed for five times, subsequently filtered and the filtrates
  were evaporated to dryness under vacuum at 50 °C and the extracts were stored at
  −20 °C before use.\n\n\n\nThe cancer cells MCF7, SK-BR-3, MDA-MB-231, HT-29, PC-3,
  Neuro 2A cancer cell lines and VERO normal cell line were obtained from American
  Cell Culture Collection. The cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 or DMEM-Ham’s F12
  supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum, L-glutamine,, penicillin and streptomycin
  and maintained at 37 °C with 5 % CO2 in a humidified atmosphere.\n\n\n\nThe cytotoxic
  activities of the extracts and doxorubicin on various cancer cells were measured
  by MTT assay. Cells in exponential growth phase were placed in 96-well plates to
  make 6000 cells/wells and sample solutions were added at concentrations ranging
  from 100 to 6.25 μg/ml in each well, subsequently incubated for 48 h. Negative control
  was treated with 0.1 % methanol. Quantities of blue formazan product were measured
  as triplicates at 570–690 nm using a microplate reader. Cytotoxicity was determined
  according to percent cell viability.\n\n\n\nThe total phenols in the extracts were
  determined by Folin-Ciocalteu method as described in Akay et al.  and given as gallic
  acid equivalent per gram of extract.\n\n\n\nRadical scavenging activities of the
  extracts were determined by using 1 mM methanolic solution of DPPH• as described
  in Yesil-Celiktas et al. .\n\n\n\nStatistical analyses of the data were performed
  by Student’s t-test. A probability value of P ≤ 0.05 was considered to denote a
  statistically significant difference, and P ≤ 0.01 was also used to show the power
  of the significance. Data are presented as mean values ± S.E.M.\n\n\n\nCalli of
  black carrot induced from stem explants on a nutrient medium supplemented with two
  different concentrations of 2,4-D which is a synthetic auxin and kinetin, a type
  of cytokinin, a class of plant hormone that promotes cell division were tested in
  terms of antioxidant and cytotoxic activities. With respect to biomass production,
  MS1 and MS3 accumulated the lowest amount of biomass, whereas MS2 and MS4 accumulated
  the highest amounts among the callus samples.\n\nCytotoxic activities of the black
  carrot extracts, together with doxorubicin as positive control were analyzed by
  MTT assay and IC50 values are provided in Table 1. All investigated extracts displayed
  dose dependent inhibition profile in terms of cell viability in MCF-7 cells. MS1,
  MS3 and MS2, MS4 were evaluated jointly in order to develop an understanding of
  the possible effects of kinetin addition to plant cell culture medium on cell viability.
  This might have two facets; possible differences in terms of secondary metabolite
  profiles of the callus biomass due to hormone usage and in chemical composition
  due to extraction methods employed and type of solvents used. At a concentration
  of 25 μg/ml, MS1 and MS3 exhibited the same cell viability value of 46 %, whereas
  MS2 and MS4 showed values of 55 and 57 %, respectively. The results suggest that
  the increase in kinetin concentration in plant cell culture medium did not have
  an effect on cytotoxicity considering 5-fold higher kinetin concentration in MS3
  and MS4 in comparison to MS1 and MS2. Therefore, it can be concluded that increasing
  kinetin concentration might not be responsible for the cytotoxic activity. IC50
  values of MS1 and MS3 were similar, whereas values of MS2 and MS4 were significantly
  higher than the other samples implying a poorer inhibiting capability containing
  lower concentrations of 2,4-D. Consequently, a 2-fold increase in concentration
  of 2,4-D resulted in more than 3-fold decrease in IC50 values suggesting that 2,4-D
  might have enhanced cytotoxicity.\n\n\nIC50 values, total phenol content, and radical
  scavenging activities of extracts obtained from plant cell culture, fields and doxorubicin
  as positive control  \n\n\n\nDose-dependent cytotoxic activity of extracts obtained
  from black carrot callus cultures and natural black carrot on MCF7, MDA-MB-231 and
  SK-BR-3 tumor cells treated with 6.25, 12.5, 25 and 50, 100 μg/mL doses of the extracts.
  “NC” denotes negative control, whereas “PC” to positive control\n\nExtracts showed
  dose dependent activity in MDA-MB-231. At a concentration of 100 μg/ml, MS1 and
  MS3 exhibited cell viability values of 56 and 43 %, whereas MS2 and MS4 showed values
  of 60 and 52 %, respectively. IC50 values of MS1 and MS4 were similar, whereas values
  of MS2 and MS3 were significantly different probably due to the 2-fold higher concentration
  of 2,4-D which is in accordance with the results of other breast cancer cell lines.\n\nExtracts
  showed dose dependent activity in SK-BR-3. At a concentration of 25 μg/ml, MS1 and
  MS3 exhibited cell viability values of 54 and 49 %, whereas MS2 and MS4 showed values
  of 74 and 133 %, respectively. IC50 values of MS1 and MS3 were similar, whereas
  values of MS2 and MS4 were significantly higher than the other samples confirming
  the enhancement capability of 2,4-D.\n\nAmong the breast cancer cell lines, MCF-7
  and SK-BR-3 turned out to be the most susceptible cell lines inhibited by MS1 and
  MS3. It is reported that lack of estrogen receptor and presence of vimentin is associated
  with poor prognosis in human breast cancer . Especially MS1 and MS3 showed significant
  IC50 values against the ER+/VIM- and ER-/VIM- cell lines of MCF-7 and SK-BR-3, whereas
  were not that effective against MDA-MB-231 being a ER-/VIM + cell line for which
  new therapeutics urgently need to be developed.\n\nExtracts showed a similar dose
  dependent inhibition profile in terms of cell viability in HT-29 cells. All four
  samples exhibited similar cell viability values between 43 and 54 % at a concentration
  of 100 μg/ml. IC50 values of MS1 and MS2 were similar, whereas values of MS3 and
  MS4 were significantly different. Jing et al  reported a GI50 value of 68.5 μg/ml
  for purple carrot extract which is in accordance with our findings. In particular,
  IC50 values of MS1 and MS3 in HT-29 cells were comparatively higher than the values
  recorded for MCF-7 cells.\n\n\nDose-dependent cytotoxic activity of black carrot
  callus extracts and natural black carrot on HT-29, PC-3, Neuro-2A tumor cells and
  VERO cells treated with 6.25, 12.5, 25 and 50, 100 μg/mL doses of the extracts\n\nExtracts
  showed dose dependent activity in PC-3 cell lines. Cell viabilities were between
  58 and 77 % at a concentration of 100 μg/ml. Although IC50 values of the samples
  were quite high, a similar trend was observed in terms of the capability of 2,4-D
  contributing to the inhibitory effect of the extracts.\n\nBlack carrot extracts
  displayed the highest cytotoxic activities against Neuro-2A cell lines which are
  associated with brain cancer. Cell viability values ranged between 38 and 46 % at
  a concentration of 6.25 μg/ml. The cell viability of extract obtained from black
  carrot harvested from fields was also in the same range. However, a significantly
  high IC50 value of 170.13 μg/ml was attained in normal cell line VERO indicating
  that its natural counterpart is an ideal candidate for treatment of neuroblastoma
  without causing negative effects to normal healthy cells. In a recent study, pretreatment
  with soybean seed anthocyanins reduced the cytotoxicity of H2O2 and inactivated
  apoptosis signal-regulating kinase proteins suggesting that anthocyanins have brain
  neuroprotective effects against oxidative stress by inhibiting the activation of
  ASK1–JNK/p38 pathways and scavenging intracellular ROS . Considering that delphinidin
  and cyanidin or their derivatives are the major compounds in both black soybean
  seed and black carrot, a similar ROS mechanism might be responsible for the high
  inhibition effect observed in Neuro-2A cell line. On the other hand, MS1, MS3 and
  MS4 were cytotoxic toward normal cell line VERO as were in the case of cancer cell
  lines.\n\nDry extracts were also used to determine total phenol content and radical
  scavenging activities. Although all samples were found to have higher TPC in comparison
  to natural black carrot extract, significantly higher TPC was observed in MS3 samples
  which contained 1 mg/L 2,4 D and 0.5 mg/L kinetin in culture medium. To investigate
  the effect of 2,4 D on TPC there was no significant differences observed even as
  TPC values were higher at lower concentrations of 2,4-D. This negative effect have
  been observed when compared with biomass production, whereas at the lowest concentration
  of 2,4 D the highest amounts accumulated among the callus samples. These results
  are in agreement with those of Moneruzzaman and coworkers  where the effect of 2,4-D
  treatment on phenol and flavonoid content was the highest with lower concentrations
  of 2,4-D.\n\nSignificant changes in the phenol contents of callus samples were also
  observed with kinetin treatments. The highest TPC values were attained with the
  highest concentrations of kinetin. Among the callus samples MS1 containing low concentrations
  of kinetin at culture medium, produced the lowest amount of TPC, while MS3 containing
  high concentrations of kinetin at culture medium exhibited the highest amount. These
  findings confirmed the results of another study  where the effect of kinetin on
  TPC was investigated.\n\nThe highest antioxidant activities were achieved with MS3
  and MS1 containing same concentrations of 2,4 D and 5-fold higher kinetin. However,
  at low concentrations of 2,4 D, samples exhibited comparatively lower radical scavenging
  capacities. It is also worth to mention that RSA values were lower at high concentrations
  of kinetin. The lowest RSA were observed in MS4 containing a low concentration of
  2,4 D and high concentration of kinetin. Consequently, high concentrations of 2,4
  D in the medium enhanced antioxidant activities of plant cell culture extracts.\n\n\n\nThe
  findings confirm the superiority of black carrot extracts possessing high antiproliferative
  effects in particular to certain cancer cell lines and antioxidant activity. With
  a holistic evaluation, MS1 and MS3 were the most potent cytotoxic extracts against
  MCF-7, SK-BR-3 and Neuro-2A cancer cell lines, together with normal cell line VERO.
  In order to overcome the negative effects against the normal cell line, studies
  can be conducted to improve therapeutic index. Considering our results along with
  the preliminary studies, we suggest that black carrot extract alone or in combination
  with the anticancer drugs may offer a good strategy for the treatment of a variety
  of human cancers that are resistant to chemotherapy and worthwhile for further studies.\n\n\n\nAccess
  to the facilities of Animal Cell Culture and Supercritical Fluid Technology Laboratories
  of Bioengineering Department at Ege University is highly appreciated.\n\n\n\n"
