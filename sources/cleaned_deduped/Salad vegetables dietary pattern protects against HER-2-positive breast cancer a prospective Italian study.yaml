  vegetables dietary pattern protects against HER-2-positive breast cancer a prospective
  Italian study.md
text: '


  Studies investigating the relation of diet to breast cancer have produced conflicting
  results. We hypothesized that dietary factors associated with breast cancer risk
  might differentially influence the HER-2 status of the cancers that develop, and
  investigated this hypothesis by analyzing the data of the ORDET prospective study.
  We analyzed 8,861 volunteer women residents of the Varese Province, Italy, for whom
  we had full data. By December 31, 2001, 238 cases had occurred in which HER-2 status
  was known. Four dietary patterns had been identified previously by factor analysis:
  salad vegetables, prudent, western, and canteen. In our study, relative risks  of
  developing HER-2-positive and HER-2-negative breast cancers by tertiles of dietary
  pattern factor scores were assessed by multinomial logistic regression. The salad
  vegetables dietary pattern had a protective effect against HER-2-positive cancers  =
  0.001), much stronger than for HER-2-negative cancers  = 0.039). This important
  finding that a salad vegetables dietary pattern protects mainly against a specific
  breast cancer subtype indicates that future studies on environmental/dietary risk
  factors should explicitly take account of the heterogeneity of breast cancer phenotypes.'
