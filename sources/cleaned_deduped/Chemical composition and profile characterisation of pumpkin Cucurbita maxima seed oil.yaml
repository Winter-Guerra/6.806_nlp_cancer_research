  composition and profile characterisation of pumpkin Cucurbita maxima seed oil.md
text: '


  Seeds of a Tunisian variety  of pumpkin  were analysed for their main chemical composition
  and for their oil properties. Expressed on dry weight basis, seed moisture was 8.46%,
  whereas contents of proteins, fibre, ash, fat, and total sugars established at 33.92%,
  3.97%, 21.97%, 31.57%, and 0.11% respectively. Gas chromatography revealed that
  the major fatty acids were oleic, linoleic, and palmitic acids. Seed oil was also
  found to be rich in tocopherols with a predominance of -tocopherol. The sterol marker
  -sisosterol accounted for 39.6% of total sterols contained in seed oil of this variety.
  Six phenolic acids  were detected, the syringic acid being predominant. As a whole,
  based on its seed oil features, pumpkin may be considered as a valuable source for
  new multi-purpose products for industrial, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical utilisation.'
