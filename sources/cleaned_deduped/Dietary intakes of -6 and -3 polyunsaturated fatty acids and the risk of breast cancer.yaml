  intakes of -6 and -3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and the risk of breast cancer.md
text: "\n\nExperimental studies suggest detrimental effects of -6 polyunsaturated
  fatty acids, and beneficial effects of -3 PUFAs on mammary carcinogenesis, possibly
  in interaction with antioxidants. However, PUFA food sources are diverse in human
  diets and few epidemiologic studies have examined whether associations between dietary
  PUFAs and breast cancer risk vary according to food sources or antioxidant intakes.
  The relationship between individual PUFA intakes estimated from diet history questionnaires
  and breast cancer risk was examined among 56,007 French women. During 8 years of
  follow-up, 1,650 women developed invasive breast cancer. Breast cancer risk was
  not related to any dietary PUFA overall; however, opposite associations were seen
  according to food sources, suggesting other potential effects than PUFA per se.
  Breast cancer risk was inversely associated with -linolenic acid  intake from fruit
  and vegetables, and from vegetable oils. Conversely, breast cancer risk was positively
  related to ALA intake from nut mixes  and processed foods, as was total ALA intake
  among women in the highest quintile of dietary vitamin E. A significant interaction
  was also found between -6 and long-chain -3 PUFAs, with breast cancer risk inversely
  related to long-chain -3 PUFAs in women belonging to the highest quintile of -6
  PUFAs. These results emphasize the need to consider food sources, as well as interactions
  between fatty acids and with antioxidants, when evaluating associations between
  PUFA intakes and breast cancer risk.  2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.\n\nBreast cancer is
  the most frequent malignancy among women in Western Europe, North America1 and more
  recently in Japan.2 In France, about 50,000 incident cases were observed and 11,200
  deaths  were due to breast cancer in 2005.3 It has been estimated that as many as
  half of breast cancer deaths could be avoided through dietary modifications,4 although
  the available evidence is far from convincing for most dietary factors.5 The role
  of fat intake in breast cancer etiology has been investigated for long6 but still
  remains controversial.7 A meta-analysis of epidemiologic studies8 observed a significant
  increase in breast cancer risk with high saturated fat intake but no association
  with monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acid  intakes. A recent prospective
  study9 reported varying associations of breast cancer with dietary fat depending
  on its food sources, hence suggesting a possible explanation for the discrepant
  results across epidemiologic studies. Moreover, in a meta-analysis covering 97 studies
  in rodents, Fay et al.10 underlined the need to distinguish between the effects
  of -6 and -3 PUFAs, with -6 PUFAs showing strong tumor-enhancing effects and -3
  PUFAs nonsignificant protective effects. Additional experimental studies suggest
  that high intakes of -3 PUFAs could exert inhibitory effects on mammary tumorigenesis
  through competition with -6 PUFAs11 or formation of oxidation products12 that may
  in turn depend on the antioxidant status.13-15 So far, such interactions have hardly
  been examined in epidemiologic studies.\n\nWe analyzed the relationship of breast
  cancer risk to PUFA intake, overall and by food sources, in a large prospective
  cohort of French women with a high diversity of dietary habits across the national
  territory.16 The analysis focused on dietary -3 PUFA intakes which have been hypothesized
  to encompass a potential for preventive strategies. Nowadays, a number of dietary
  fish oil supplements and foods enriched with -3 PUFAs are available on the market,
  although their benefit on cancer prevention has not yet been ascertained.17 As a
  secondary analysis, we investigated potential interactions of -3 PUFA intakes with
  intakes of -6 PUFAs and vitamin E, a liposoluble antioxidant, in relation to breast
  cancer risk.\n\nALA, -linolenic acid; BMI, body mass index; CI, confidence interval;

  is a prospective cohort study on cancer risk factors conducted in France among women
  insured with the Mutuelle Generale de lEducation Nationale, a national health insurance
  scheme covering teachers, teacher spouses and employees of the National Education
  System.18 Overall, 98,995 women volunteers aged 40-65 years were enrolled in 1989-1991
  after replying to a baseline questionnaire and giving their informed consent. The
  study was approved by the French National Commission for Data Protection and Privacy.\n\nIn
  1993, a diet history questionnaire19 was sent to participants who had previously
  answered both the baseline questionnaire and a second questionnaire on reproductive
  history and hormonal treatments. After two reminders for nonrespondents, 77,613
  dietary questionnaires were collected between June 1993 and July 1997. Of these,
  2,104 were excluded because of miscoding, duplicate answers  or empty questionnaire.
  In addition, we excluded 985 respondents who did not give their consent to follow-up
  by the health insurer  in case of dropout. The remaining 74,524 subjects with available
  dietary measurements constituted the French component of the European Prospective
  Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition.20\n\nInformation on educational level,
  reproductive history, history of benign breast diseases, familial history of breast
  cancer and hormonal treatments was obtained from the questionnaires preceding the
  dietary questionnaire and from a follow-up questionnaire accompanying the dietary
  questionnaire. Anthropometric measurements and smoking history were updated using
  all available follow-up questionnaires at the time of the analysis. Menopausal status
  and age at menopause were determined using information on last menstruation, hot
  flushes, hysterectomy, oophorectomy and use of hormonal treatments recorded in each
  follow-up questionnaire.\n\nWe excluded participants in the top and bottom 1% of
  the ratio of reported energy intake to basal metabolic rate, computed on the basis
  of age, height and weight at the time of the dietary survey.21 Of the remaining
  73,034 subjects, 4,500 who had reported cancer diagnosis  before responding to the
  dietary questionnaire and 901 with unavailable follow-up information after this
  questionnaire were excluded. Finally, to focus on dietary intakes, we excluded 11,626
  women who reported use of vitamin E, C or -carotene supplements in 1995, 2000 or
  2002, leaving 56,007 subjects for the analysis.\n\nThe diet history questionnaire19
  was designed to assess usual dietary intake during the past year and consisted of
  2 parts. In the first part, divided into 8 meals or food occasions, subjects were
  asked about the frequency of consumption  of a given list of foods and food groups
  \ and the amounts usually consumed, using either natural units  or portion sizes
  as illustrated in a booklet of colored photos.22 The second part of the questionnaire
  inquired the relative frequency of consumption of individual foods within food groups
  of the first part. It also included specific questions on the usual types of fat
  used as a spread on bread, used for cooking, added after cooking and used in salad
  dressings. Overall, the questionnaire covered the daily consumption of 208 food
  items, beverages and recipes.\n\nThe food composition table was initially derived
  from the French national database.23 Moreover, specific analyses were performed
  to determine the fatty acid content of a number of food items, including sunflower,
  olive and peanut oils, margarine, vegetables and processed meat. For the remaining
  foods, missing information on PUFA content  was completed using the food composition
  table that had been developed for another French study, based on a compilation of
  published data.24 Dietary intake of long-chain -3 PUFAs was computed as the sum
  of EPA, DPA and DHA intakes. We also considered the ratio of total -6 PUFA intake
  over total -3 PUFA intake. Other nutrients assessed included ethanol, vitamins C
  and E, and carotenoids expressed as -carotene equivalents.\n\nThe reproducibility
  and relative validity of the diet history questionnaire was assessed in 1990-1991
  using an independent sample of 115 women with an educational level comparable with
  that of the E3N-EPIC participants.19 The reference method for dietary assessment
  was based on the average of 12 24-hr dietary recalls completed monthly on varying
  days of the week during the year after completion of the diet history questionnaire.
  Spearmans correlation coefficient between the diet history questionnaire and the
  average of the 12 recalls was 0.49 for total fat intake, 0.48 for total PUFA intake,
  0.46 for -6 PUFA intake and 0.35 for -3 PUFA intake.\n\nCases were ascertained through
  active follow-up, with questionnaires sent in December 1994, April 1997, June 2000
  and July 2002. All follow-up questionnaires asked participants whether any cancer
  had been diagnosed, requesting the address of their physician for confirmation.
  Deaths in the cohort were detected from reports by family members or the postal
  service, and by searching the health insurance company  database, which contains
  updated information on vital status. Information on cause of death was obtained
  from the National Service on Causes of Deaths.\n\nA total of 1,864 incident breast
  cancer cases were identified in the study subjects between their response to the
  dietary questionnaire and the mailing date of the last follow-up questionnaire in
  2002. Of these, 63 were only self-reported cases, the remainder being confirmed
  by a pathology report. These cases were included, as self-reporting proved to be
  extremely accurate in this cohort. After exclusion of 214 cases of carcinoma in
  situ, 1,650 cases of invasive breast cancer were available for analysis.\n\nA total
  of 448,439 person-years  accumulated from the date of return of the dietary questionnaire
  to the date of cancer diagnosis for all cancer cases, to the date of the last questionnaire
  returned for nonrespondents  and deceased subjects, or to the mailing date of the
  last follow-up questionnaire in 2002 for replies received after this date. Subjects
  diagnosed with in situ breast cancer  or cancer of another site  were censored at
  their date of diagnosis.\n\nThe relationship between nutrient intakes and breast
  cancer risk was investigated using Cox proportional hazards regression models with
  age as the time scale.25 The estimated hazard ratio  and the corresponding 95% confidence
  interval  were computed after stratifying on 5-year interval birth cohorts,26 and
  adjusting for the following confounders: alcohol consumption, smoking history, history
  of breast cancer in mother or sister, personal history of benign breast disease,
  age at menarche, parity, physical activity at baseline, menopausal status  and body
  mass index. For postmenopausal women, analyses were further adjusted for age at
  menopause  and current use of menopausal hormones. We tested for an interaction
  between menopausal status  and PUFA intake. Missing ages at menopause were imputed
  to 47 years if menopause was artificial, or 51 years if menopause was natural, ages
  which corresponded to the medians observed among postmenopausal women with available
  age at menopause who reported artificial or natural menopause, respectively. For
  each remaining adjustment factor, missing data were imputed to the mode among the
  subjects with complete data, since the proportion of cases having missing data did
  not exceed 5%. We verified that HR estimates hardly changed after additional adjustment
  for educational level; however, educational level was not associated with breast
  cancer risk in the E3N-EPIC population that is rather homogenous with respect to
  this variable.\n\nWe calculated PUFA intake from the 208 food items grouped into
  food groups such as added fat, meat, marine sources  and processed foods. In all
  models, PUFA intakes were expressed as percentages of nonalcohol energy  and adjusted
  for nonalcohol energy intake.27 Alternatively, we expressed PUFA intakes as the
  exponentiated residuals of the linear regression of log-transformed PUFA intake
  on log-transformed energy intake.27 We also evaluated the addition effect of PUFA
  intake on breast cancer risk  by fitting crude PUFA intake along with energy intake
  from other sources.28 In both instances, we generally found similar results. Nutrient
  intakes were categorized into quintiles according to the distribution observed in
  the entire cohort. Tests for trend across quintiles were performed by fitting the
  median value for each quintile of nutrient intake as a continuous variable and assessing
  whether its coefficient equaled 0 using the Wald chi-square statistic.\n\nTo investigate
  interactions between -3 and -6 PUFA and vitamin E intakes, HRs of breast cancer
  associated with increasing -3 PUFA intake were calculated per quintile of -6 PUFA
  \ or vitamin E intakes. As they showed similar results, the second to fourth quintiles
  of dietary vitamin E intakes were grouped together. We performed tests for interaction
  by applying the likelihood ratio test to PUFA trend variable. As there was no clear
  evidence for an interaction between PUFA and carotenoid intakes  with respect to
  breast cancer, results are not included here. We verified that the proportional
  hazards assumption was not violated for our main exposure and other fixed covariates
  by testing interactions between these and functions of age. Moreover, we conducted
  a lag analysis by excluding the first year of follow-up for all subjects and 168
  cases of invasive breast cancer among them. All p values were 2-sided. Statistical
  analyses were performed using SAS statistical software.\n\nAt baseline, total fat
  intake contributed an average 38.3% of nonalcohol energy intake, including 6.7%
  from PUFA intake. Linoleic acid was the predominantly consumed PUFA, followed by
  ALA. Among long-chain -3 PUFAs, DHA was the major fatty acid. The main food sources
  for linoleic acid intake were added fat  including sunflower oil, processed foods
  \ including nut mixes, and meat. Arachidonic acid originated mostly from meat, followed
  by marine sources  and processed foods, whereas long-chain -3 PUFAs originated mostly
  from marine sources, followed by meat. In contrast, a variety of foods contributed
  to ALA intake: processed foods  including nut mixes, fruit and vegetables, cheese,
  butter and margarine, meat  and vegetable oils. Table I shows the characteristics
  of subjects at inclusion according to quintiles of ALA and long-chain -3 PUFA intake.
  Increasing quintiles of ALA intake were associated with increasing total and saturated
  fat intakes as percentages of nonalcohol energy, increasing alcohol consumption,
  a greater likelihood of smoking and increasing BMI. The same held for long-chain
  -3 PUFAs, except for the absence of a trend with saturated fat intake.  \n\nOverall,
  breast cancer risk was not related to -6  or -3  PUFA intake, or the ratio of -6
  to -3 PUFAs. Interaction tests with menopausal status or hormone treatment use among
  postmenopausal women were not statistically significant. When we stratified on total
  -6 PUFA intake, we found a decreased risk of breast cancer associated with high
  long-chain -3 PUFA intake confined to the highest quintile of -6 PUFA intakes. Breast
  cancer risk was not related to long-chain -3 PUFA intake in any but the highest
  quintile of dietary -6 PUFAs, and remained unrelated to total -3 or ALA intake regardless
  of -6 PUFA consumption.  \n\nAnalyzing the relationship between breast cancer risk
  and individual PUFA intake from their main food sources, we found decreased breast
  cancer risk associated with high linoleic acid or ALA intake from vegetable oils,
  as well as with high ALA intake from fruit and vegetables. Conversely, an increase
  in breast cancer risk was associated with high linoleic acid or ALA intake from
  processed foods, including nut mixes. Breast cancer risk was related to neither
  ALA intake from other food sources  nor longer chain -6  and -3 PUFA intake from
  any source. No test for interaction with menopausal status was statistically significant.
  \ \n\nAnalyses stratified by vitamin E intake are presented in Table IV; results
  are not shown for intermediate quintiles of dietary vitamin E where null associations
  were observed. A significant trend of increasing breast cancer risk with increasing
  ALA intake was found in women in the top quintile of dietary vitamin E ; however,
  the test for interaction was not statistically significant. When we considered ALA
  intake from various food sources, the positive associations with processed foods
  and nut mixes and the inverse associations with vegetable oils, fruit and vegetables
  were independent of dietary vitamin E intake. There was no association with longer
  chain PUFAs, neither arachidonic acid nor -3 PUFAs, regardless of dietary vitamin
  E intake.  \n\nThe statistically significant associations of breast cancer risk
  with linoleic acid and ALA intakes from vegetable oils, ALA intake from fruit and
  vegetables, and linoleic acid and ALA intakes from nut mixes remained when we excluded
  the first year of follow-up. The inverse association between long-chain -3 PUFA
  intake and breast cancer risk among women in the highest quintile of -6 PUFA intake
  also remained statistically significant ; however, the test for interaction became
  borderline significant.\n\nThis prospective cohort study showed no evidence of an
  association between estimated -6 or -3 PUFA intakes and breast cancer risk, in agreement
  with former meta-analyses of prospective studies for linoleic acid29 and total -3
  PUFA17 intakes. However, our study provided some indication that dietary PUFA may
  play opposite roles in breast cancer risk depending on their food sources and that
  -6 and -3 PUFA intakes may interact in their association with breast cancer. Whether
  dietary vitamin E further affects dietary PUFA and breast cancer association was
  not clearly demonstrated from our study.\n\nThe epidemiologic evidence regarding
  ALA and breast cancer relationship is conflicting. Only one case-control study in
  Uruguay30 found a positive association between ALA intake and breast cancer risk.
  In contrast, the Netherlands Cohort Study,31 a case-control study in Italy32 and
  a case-control study using adipose breast tissue33 showed decreased breast cancer
  risks associated with high ALA levels. Other case-control studies reported no association
  of breast cancer risk with dietary ALA intakes,34 or plasma35, 36 and erythrocyte
  membrane37 levels. The discrepancy across studies seems unlikely to be explained
  by different levels of consumption: for instance, median ALA intake in the E3N-EPIC
  cohort was 0.9 g/d, compared with 1.0 g/d in the Uruguayan controls.30\n\nInstead,
  another possible explanation for the lack of consistency among studies may be the
  different dietary sources of ALA. In the Uruguayan study,30 meat was its major dietary
  source, whereas oils and raw vegetables were the main contributors in the Italian
  study finding an inverse association.32 The diversity of food sources that we observed
  for ALA intake in our study is consistent with another French study.24 In line with
  previous studies, we found decreased breast cancer risk associated with high consumption
  of ALA from fruit and vegetables, and vegetable oils, and increased breast cancer
  risk associated with high consumption of nut mixes and processed meat. Because nut
  mixes were proposed as a single item eaten with aperitifs, we cannot exclude residual
  confounding by alcohol consumption; we note, however, that another French study
  reported a positive association between breast cancer risk and ALA intake originating
  mainly from nuts.38 Moreover, the stronger association that we observed between
  ALA intake and breast cancer risk in the highest quintile of dietary vitamin E intake
  favors a direct association with nuts, a major dietary source for both these nutrients.
  Altogether, these results suggest that ALA intake may not have a direct biological
  effect on breast cancer occurrence but may reflect different food patterns involving
  other nutrients that could affect breast cancer risk. Thus, the inverse association
  of breast cancer risk with ALA intake from vegetables and vegetable oils, as with
  linoleic acid, may indeed result from other compounds, such as folate or lignan
  that have been related to a reduced risk in this cohort.39, 40\n\nAlternatively,
  whether all cis vs. cis/trans-ALA isomers originating from different food sources
  may exert different effects on carcinogenesis remains to be determined. It is of
  interest that linoleic acid intake also showed opposite associations with breast
  cancer depending on whether it came from  vegetable oils or from processed foods.
  Partially hydrogenated vegetable oils used in the preparation of margarines and
  a number of industrial foods are a source of trans fatty acids including isomers
  of ALA and linoleic acid41, 42 that have been associated with an increased risk
  of breast cancer in biomarker studies,43, 44 including the present cohort.45\n\nOverall,
  we found no association between long-chain -3 PUFA intake and breast cancer risk,
  in agreement with most epidemiologic cohort studies.17, 46-48 As exceptions, inverse
  associations have been reported in Chinese and Japanese women having intakes up
  to 40 times greater than Western ones.49-51 We note that, like in other Western
  populations,24, 52 meat consumption sensibly contributed to long-chain -3 PUFA intake
  in this cohort, in addition to marine sources. Although null associations persisted
  regardless of food sources, we did observe a statistically significant interaction
  with -6 PUFAs, suggesting that women with lowest long-chain -3 PUFA intake but highest
  -6 PUFA intake  could benefit from increasing their long-chain -3 PUFA intake. Similarly,
  some epidemiologic studies have shown decreased breast cancer risks associated with
  high ratios of  -3 to -6 PUFA intake, based on dietary questionnaires53, 54 or biomarkers.33,
  55, 56 In the same line, a Chinese prospective study49 found a direct association
  between -6 PUFA intakes and breast cancer risk confined to women having the lowest
  intakes of long-chain -3 PUFAs. Such observation is consistent with the competition
  between -6 and -3 PUFAs for eicosanoid production as an underlying mechanism.11,
  57\n\nWe did not find any evidence of an interaction between long-chain -6 or -3
  PUFA and dietary vitamin E with respect to breast cancer risk. Long-chain PUFA contribute
  to the production of peroxides57 which have been hypothesized to play a role in
  breast cancer etiology.58 Although peroxides have a proven genotoxic and cytotoxic
  action on normal cells, they might favor apoptosis in tumor cells.59 Experimental
  evidence indicates that antioxidants, notably the lipid-soluble vitamin E, may interact
  with the effect of long-chain PUFAs on tumor growth by preventing the formation
  of peroxides.12, 13, 60 So far, a limited number of epidemiologic studies have been
  published, and their results were divergent: whereas 2 prospective studies suggested
  an inverse association of breast cancer risk with combined high intakes of vitamin
  E and PUFA,61, 62 a case-control study reported a decreased risk of breast cancer
  associated with high arachidonic acid intakes among women with low vitamin E intakes,
  but an increased risk among women with both high arachidonic acid and vitamin E
  intakes.34\n\nOur prospective analysis of the relationship between dietary PUFA
  intake and breast cancer risk had several strengths and limitations. The strengths
  of our study included the minimal loss to follow-up, the high degree of reliability
  of the dietary questionnaire comparable to other studies,19 its detailed list of
  foods including 14 types of fish, allowing the distinction between leaner and fattier
  fishes and an accurate estimation of long-chain -3 PUFA intake,57 high variability
  of dietary patterns across France16 and of ALA food sources24 and a sufficient sample
  size to allow stratified analyses. In contrast, our study was limited by a single
  dietary measurement, and the inability to assess other liposoluble antioxidants
  \ or to distinguish between vitamin E compounds. Changes in dietary habits or food
  composition may have occurred before the onset of breast cancer, further enhancing
  measurement error inherent to the use of dietary questionnaire.63, 64 Moreover,
  we could not assess consumption of -3 supplements during the study period although
  it was likely to be marginal.24 How resulting misclassification between categories
  of fatty acid or vitamin E consumption65 may affect estimated associations between
  PUFA intakes and breast cancer risk is unclear. At least, misclassification is likely
  to be nondifferential with respect to breast cancer due to the prospective design.
  Finally, we cannot exclude results due to chance alone owing to the high number
  of tests performed.\n\nIn conclusion, findings from this large French cohort indicate
  that the association of breast cancer risk with -6 and -3 PUFA intake may differ
  according to food sources, either reflecting different food patterns or geometrical
  isomers. The study also provided further support to the hypothesis of an interaction
  between -6 and -3 PUFAs with respect to breast cancer risk. Altogether, these results
  emphasize the need to distinguish among food sources of PUFAs, e.g., fish, vegetables,
  vegetable oils vs. processed foods and to consider interactions between -6 and -3
  PUFAs when evaluating potential beneficial effects of high -3 PUFA intakes for breast
  cancer prevention. The hypothesis of an effectmodification by antioxidant intakes
  deserves further consideration.\n\nDr. Anne Thiebaut is grateful to Fondation de
