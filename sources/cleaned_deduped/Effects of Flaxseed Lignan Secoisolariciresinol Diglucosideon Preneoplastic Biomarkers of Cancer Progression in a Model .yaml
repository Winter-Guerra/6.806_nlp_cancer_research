  Breast cancer prevention efforts are focused increasingly on potentially beneficial
  dietary modifications due to their ease of implementation and wide acceptance. Secoisolariciresinol
  diglucoside  is a lignan found in high concentration in flaxseed that may have selective
  estrogen receptor modulator-like effects resulting in antiestrogenic activity in
  a high estrogen environment. In parallel with a human phase II prevention trial,
  female ACI rats  received 0, 10, or 100 ppm SDG in the feed. The 100 ppm SDG treatment
  produced similar blood lignan levels as those observed in our human pilot study.
  Mammary and ovarian cancer progression were induced using local ovarian DMBA treatment
  and subcutaneous sustained release 17-estradiol administered starting at 7 weeks
  of age. Mammary gland and ovarian tissues were collected at 3 mo after initiation
  of treatment and examined for changes in epithelial cell proliferation, histopathology,
  and dysplasia scores, as well as expression of selected genes involved in proliferation,
  estrogen signaling, and cell adhesion. Treatment with SDG normalized several biomarkers
  in mammary gland tissue  that had been altered by carcinogen. There is no indication
  that SDG promotes preneoplastic progression in the ovarian epithelium.'
