  pharmacodynamics, since it effluxes many cytotoxic hydrophobic anticancer drugs
  from gastrointestinal tract, brain, liver and kidney. Piperine is known to enhance
  the bioavailability of curcumin, as a substrate of P-gp by at least 2000 %. Besides
  these at least 50 other substrates and inhibitors of P-gp have been reported so
  far. All P-gp inhibitors have diverse structures. Although little is known about
  binding of some flavonoids and steroids at the NBD of P-gp in the vicinity of ATP
  binding site inhibiting its hydrolysis, a valid explanation of how P-gp accommodates
  such a diverse set of inhibitors is still awaited. In the present study, piperine
  up to 100 μM has not shown observable cytotoxic effect on MDCK cell line, and it
  has been shown to accumulate rhodamine by fluorescence microscopy and fluorescent
  activated cell sorter in MDCK cells. Computational simulation for piperine and some
  first and second generation P-gp inhibitors has shown that these dock at the NBD
  site of P-gp. A comparative simulation study has been carried out regarding their
  docking and binding energies. Binding conformation of P-gp co-crystallized complexes
  with ADP, AMP-PNP, and ATP were compared with piperine. The receptor based E-pharmacophore
  of docked piperine has been simulated to find common features amongst P-gp inhibitors.
  Finally it has been concluded that piperine could be utilized as base molecule for
  design and development of safe non-toxic inhibitor of P-gp in order to enhance the
  bioavailability of most of its substrates.\n\n\nPiperine binds between the consensus
  sequence of Walker A/P loop and Walker C loop at the nucleotide binding domain which
  is crucial for ATP coupled efflux through P-gp. ATP binding competes with piperine.
  This explains why piperine enhances the bioavailability of its substrate like curcumin
  by 2000 %\n\n\n\nThe online version of this article contains supplementary material,
  which is available to authorized users.\n\n\n\nDocking E-pharmacophores Homology
  modeling Immunofluorscence P-glycoprotein P-gp inhibitors Piperine\n\n\n\nLarge
  number of hydrophobic drugs have poor bioavailability due to efflux through MDR
  proteins. Major reasons contributing to the low plasma and tissue levels of P-gp
  substrates appear to be due to rapid systemic elimination. However, in the presence
  of the P-gp inhibitors numerous substrates have shown enhanced bioavailability.
  Piperine is an alkaloid present in black pepper. Piperine enhances bioavailability
  of curcumin , phenytoin, propanol, theophylline  and rifampicin . Influence of Trikatu
  on rifampicin bioavailability was studied by Dhanukar et al. .\n\nP-gp is organized
  in two homologous halves, each half begins with a TMD containing six TM segments
  followed by a hydrophilic nucleotide-binding domain . ATP cassettes/domain of P-gp
  is composed of ATP binding site, ABC transporter and Walker A/P loop. Linker peptide
  is thought to be involved in ATP hydrolysis as a γ- phosphate center and/or as a
  signal to membrane spanning domains. Walker A/P loop having consensus sequence GxxGxGKST
  forms a loop which binds to alpha and β-phosphates or di and trinucleotides. The
  two ATP molecules bind at the interface between the Walker A sites and Walker C
  motif or linker peptide sequences of NBDs .\n\n\n\nThe cavity of NBDs shares binding
  sites for both ATP as well as inhibitors; as steroids and flavonoids do  whereas
  substrates have different binding sites. Numerous P-gp substrates are effluxed through
  P-gp as summarized by Vishal et al. .\n\nIn the present work a plausible explanation
  has been given for the enhanced bioavailability of P-gp substrates in presence of
  piperine. Attempt has been made to utilize the available data to correlate development
  of 1st, 2nd and 3rd generation of inhibitors with their docking scores at NBD domain.
  3D structure of P-gp complexed with ADP , AMP-PNP  and ATP  has been used for comparative
  study of binding with docked complex of P- gp- piperine.\n\n\n\n\n\nMDCK cells were
  obtained from NCCS and grown in MEM media, supplemented with 10 % FCS, 2 % sodium
  pyruvate, 1 % pencillin, and 1 % streptomycin. Cells were grown in T-25 flasks to
  80 % confluency at 370 C humidified atmosphere of 5 % CO2 and humidified air. Cells
  were routinely trypsinized and subcultured.\n\n\n\nStock solution of piperine was
  prepared in DMSO and stored at −200 C. Stock was diluted in the range of 10 μm to
  100 μM concentrations. Exponentially growing cells were seeded at the densities
  that allowed untreated cells to reach 75–80 % confluent state. Cells were treated
  with piperine in fresh media after 24 h of plating.\n\n\n\nCytotoxic effect of piperine
  on MDCK cell line was determined by the trypan blue staining, counting the viable
  cells on hemocytometer. MDCK cells were seeded in 12 well plates. After 24 h of
  plating the cells were exposed to increasing concentrations of piperine ranging
  from 10 μM to 100 μM in serum free media, both attached and non attached cells were
  collected and resuspended in phosphate buffered saline. The IC50 concentrations
  were determined from concentration response curve.\n\n\n\nThe cells were seeded
  on coverslips in six well plates for 24 h following treatment with piperine and
  1 μg/ml of rhodamine, after 1 h of incubation at 37 0 C, cells were washed twice
  with PBS, mounted and inspected by fluorescence microscopy \n\n\n\nRhodamine, a
  fluorescent dye was used to monitor the piperine induced accumulation of rhodamine
  in cells described previously . MDCK cells were seeded at density 4 × 104cell/well
  in six well plates for 24 h. After approaching 90 % confluency, cells were co-treated
  with rhodamine and piperine for 30 min at 370 C. The supenatant was removed, and
  the cells were harvested and suspended in PBS. Measurement of accumulated rhodamine
  due to piperine in each sample was analyzed by FACS and 10,000 cells were counted.\n\n\n\nHuman
  P-gp amino acids reference sequence  was taken from NCBI protein ref sequence database.
  Homology modeling module Prime was used for modeling as follows:Query sequence was
  imported into the structure prediction window. HAMMER/Pfam program was used to search
  for sequence patterns in-build in prime. It generates hidden Markov model from a
  multiple sequence alignment and is used to identify the query family and provides
  information about which residues are conserved in the consensus sequence. Finding
  sequence homologs: To find sequence homologue PDB BLAST was performed and as template
  2HYD was selected along with ADP. Structure of human P-gp is available but none
  of the structure is complexed with ATP/ADP at NBD, therefore 2HYD was selected for
  study. PDB BLAST has shown total score e-value, maximum identity 501, 2e-76 and
  34 % respectively. However the maximum identity, e value, and positives at NBD domain,
  i.e., from 392 to 629 was 120/234, 1e-62, 142/234 is quite well to produce a reliable
  model. Build structure steps: It closes gaps, and predicts side-chain conformations
  of non-conserved residues to produce a model of local energy minima conformation
  with no clashes. The structure produced in the previous step is representing only
  local energy minima not the global minima. Therefore, regions with gaps in the alignment
  were refined in the next step. Refinement step: In the first refinement phase, default
  sampling method was used for loop size of less than five residues and for refinement
  of more than five residues, extended sampling method was used. Obtained model was
  validated.\n\n\n\nCanvas module of Schrodinger was used to simulate fingerprints
  or molecular properties using hierarchical clustering algorithm. All inhibitors,
  tacrolimus, tamoxifen, terfenadine, tetrabenazine, valinomycin, verapamil, vinblastine
  and 3rd generation inhibitors Biricodar, LY335979, GF120918, OC144-093, R101933,
  Valspodar, XR9051) published in pharmacotherapy journal  were clustered using linear
  finger print and Tanimoto similarity to cluster in seven classes based on the similarities.\n\n\n\nThe
  2D structures of P-gp inhibitors were generated by drawing on ChemSketch and 3-D
  structures from CORINA server and further optimized. Ligprep module of Schrödinger
  was used to generate energy minimized 3D structures using OPLS-2005. To correct
  Lewis structure and tautomeric and ionization states default settings were used.\n\n\n\n3D
  structure of modeled P-gp was prepared using protein preparation wizard. Bond order
  and formal charges were assigned and hydrogen was added. His tautomers and ionization
  states were predicted, hydroxyl and thiol hydrogens were sampled. For structures
  with missing side chain atoms the refinement module prime, was used to predict their
  conformation. Further to refine the structure OPLS-2005 force field parameter was
  used to alleviate steric clashes and the minimization was terminated when RMSD reached
  maximum cutoff value of 0.30 Å. Binding site was defined by centroid of ADP, midpoint
  of grid box and dimensions were set to 15 Å. Hydroxyl rotatable groups enclosed
  in the grid were sampled. For grid preparation and docking at TMD domain centroid
  of complexed ligand was taken.\n\n\n\nDocking was performed at the nucleotide binding
  site of NB domain where inhibitor binding shared with ATP binding site using Glide
  module of Schrödinger and also docked at the TMD of human P-gp complexed with a
  inhibitor. All inhibitors were set for docking with stranded docking precision,
  further it was used to refine the docked poses with option to output Glide XP descriptor
  information.\n\n\n\nE-pharmacophore was generated using default chemical features:
  hydrogen bond acceptor, hydrogen bond donor, hydrophobe, negative ionizable, positive
  ionizable, and aromatic ring. Hydrogen bond acceptor and donor sites were represented
  as vectors. Each pharmacophore feature site is first assigned an energetic value
  equal to the sum of the Glide XP contributions of the atoms comprising the site
  to be quantified and ranked on the basis of these energetic terms used in Glide
  XP descriptors.\n\n\n\nDocking was also performed with AutoDock which efficiently
  docks macro-cyclic ligand with a large number of flexible bonds while Glide docking
  module is more efficient for molecules with fewer number of rotatable bonds. These
  inhibitors were docked at the nucleotide binding domain using AutoDock 3.0 . Grid
  size was set to include significant portions of the surrounding surface of nucleotide
  binding domain in each simulation. The dimensions of the grids for nucleotide binding
  site were set to 72 Å in each dimension, with a spacing of 0.375 Å between the grid
  points and the center of grid was taken form crystal structure. The default AutoDock
  run parameters were as follows: the maximum number of energy evaluations, the maximum
  number of generation in the genetic algorithm and the number of GA per run were
  2,500,000, 2,700,000 and 50 respectively. All other run parameters were maintained
  at their default settings. As far as the search methods are concerned, genetic algorithm
  was used .\n\n\n\nLigplot  and HBPLUS  were used to generate 2D plot of the docked
  conformations to find out hydrogen bond and hydrophobic interactions.\n\n\n\nPiperine
  has been tested for its cytoxicity/cell viability in MDCK cell line which overexpresses
  P-gp. Piperine treated MDCK cells survive for a longer time than piperine untreated
  cells, i.e., this molecule has survival advantage when cells are deprived of nutrition.\n\n\nSurvival
  benefit of piperine over MDCK cell line. Untreated cells have shown decrease in
  percent cell viability after 90 h while piperine exposed cells have not only shown
  non-cyotoxic effect but also manage to survive for longer time\n\nTo quantify the
  enhancement of bioavailability by piperine, cells were treated with rhodamine and
  monitored by FACS. At higher concentration of piperine, rhodamine accumulation increased
  by two fold, confirming that piperine is an inhibitor of P-gp. In order to assess
  drug accumulation on treatment with piperine, the cells were analyzed by fluorescence
  microscopy. Rhodamine accumulation in mitochondria and cytosol was found to be higher
  comparable to control at higher concentrations of piperine.\n\n\nAccumulation of
  rhodamine dye on treatment of piperine measured by FACS. Bar diagram showing increased
  accumulation of rhodamine on treatment with 20–140 μg of piperine. Overlay picture
  of FACS at 120–140 μg of piperine treatment\n\n\nRhodamine accumulations on treatment
  of piperine cells were treated only with rhodamine and rhodamine and piperine. Rhodamine
  accumulation is clearly observed in the surrounding of nuclear membrane as well
  as in cytosol. All pictures were taken at 40X on inverted microscope\n\n\n\nPDB
  Blast of the human P-gp reference sequence with bacterial ABC transporter from Staphylococcus
  aureus sequence having 3 Å resolution has given BLAST score, expect 7e-77, identities
  171/497, positives 263/497, gaps 10/497. S. aureus was used as template for human
  P-gp protein modeling. Obtained model has shown overall quality factor of 92.032.
  Ramachandran plots of model has shown that core regions, additionally allowed regions,
  generously allowed regions and disallowed regions were 91.6 %, 7.5 %, 0.9 %, 0.0
  % respectively.\n\n\n\nCavity of P-gp nucleotide binding site was simulated by molegro
  software . The two nucleotide binding sites have shown cavity size of 427.008 Å3
  and 338.944 Å3. NBD domain where ADP is complexed was selected for docking.\n\n\nModeled
  human P-gp along with ADP and amino acids close ADP. Cavity of NBD domain of P-gp
  was simulated by molegro shown in green mesh\n\n\n\nIn order to find out whether
  piperine also binds at NBD domain of P-gp, it was docked and amino acid residues
  lying 3Ǻ close to NBD were compared with ADP, ATP, AMP-PNP from their X-ray crystallographic
  complexes and with docked P-glycoprotein-piperine complex. Docking simulation has
  shown that all conformers of piperine bind in single mode at the nucleotide binding
  site. 2D plot of X-ray crystallographic structure of co-crystallized ATP, ADP &amp;
  AMP-PNP with P-gp have shown that they share common residues Y349B, I356B, G377B,
  G379B, K380B, S381B, K477A as piperine does. It indicates that binding of piperine
  is similar to ATP, ADP and AMP-PNP bindings.\n\n\n2D plot of AMP-PNP, ATP and ADP
  complexed with NBD of multidrug transporter and docked complex of piperine at NBD
  of PDB ID-2HYD. Amino acids which are in close contact to ligand are shown 2D plot

  site. 2D plot human multidrug resistance protein 1 complexed with ATP, Mg and HOH

  of 2HYD showing binding mode of the molecule and amino acid stablizing the complexs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nP-gp
  inhibitors were docked at the NBD of P-gp which have hydrophobic cavity where small
  steroid like molecules bind whereas flavonoids binding is shared with ATP binding
  site as well as steroid binding site . Docking energies of piperine and its conformation
  indicate how it docked at the NBD site. Docking conformation of all inhibitors is
  shown with E-pharmacophore features in Fig. 2S.\n\nIn our docking study with Glide,
  docking energy of ATP is nearly −12.18 kcal mol−1. Most of the new generation inhibitors
  have docking energies closer to −11 kcal mol−1 except R101933. LY335979, GF120918,
  Biricodar having docking energies −11.42, −11.37, −11.26 kcal mol−1 respectively.
  Third generation inhibitor biricodar is a clinically important molecule which has
  docking score −11.26 equal to AMP-PNP and higher to AMP.\n\n\nGlide dock score of
  1st and 2nd/3rd generation inhibitors at NBD site  \n\n\nAll scores are given in
  kcal mol−1; 3rd generation inhibitors are marked with star\n\nDocking was also performed
  at the TMD domain of P-gp where it is complexed with ligand OJZ:-4,11,18-tris(1-methylethyl)-6,13,20-triselena-3,10,17,22,23,24-hexaazatetracyclo
  tetracosa-1(21),7,14-triene-2,9,16-trione. Similar SP/XP-Glide docking protocol
  was followed except, center for grid generation was set to the centroid of complex
  ligand OJZ, i.e., X, Y and Z: coordinates were 19.091, 52.349 and −0.277 respectively.
  The glide docking results are summarized in Table 3.\n\n\nDocking score of 1st and
  2nd/3rd generation inhibitors at TMD of pg-P  \n\n\nHowever docking score obtained
  with AutoDock favors clinical developmental progress made in the direction of 2nd
  and 3rd generation of inhibitors. Descending orders of their docking energies are
  Biricodar-vx-710, R101933, XR9576, OC144-093, GF120918 and LY335979. To summarize,
  inhibitors of P-gp were docked and docked conformations of highest priority were
  plotted by ligplot software. Presence of these residues at binding site could be
  used as reference for docking and virtual screening for next generation of P-gp
  inhibitors.\n\n\n\n\n\nSince P-gp inhibitors are diverse set of active molecules
  therefore we prepared hierarchical cluster into seven classes. These clusters are
  cluster1: ADP, ATP and AMP-PNP cluster2: itraconazole, ketaconazole and chloropromazine
  cluster3: ritonavir, nicardpine, terfenadine, tetrabenzene, tamoxifen and bepridil
  cluster4: LY335979, quanidine, vinblastine and quinine cluster5: cortisol, progestreron,
  clarithromycin, sirolimus, tacrolimus and erthromycin cluster6: XR9576, GF120918,
  R101933, biricodar, reserpine, aestimizole and amiodarone cluster7: OC144-093 and
  piperine. Disulfiram and dipridamole have unique structure these do not belong to
  any cluster. All these clusters were docked with SP glide and refined with XP glide
  scoring function using energy based descriptors. Energy based pharmacophore shown
  in Fig. 3S(a–f) and Table 4. The most favorable interaction shown by inhibitors
  of clusters 2,3,4,6 and 7 are their aromatic regions R35, R42, R58, R87, R18 of
  the NBD where purine ring of ATP/ADP binds. These aromatic regions shown by orange
  ring have spatial distance in range of 11–13 Å with negative ionizable center.\n\n\nE-pharmacophore
  features of P-gp inhibitors and scores  \n\n\n\nE-pharmacophore feature of the inhibitors
  of highest docking score, i.e., LY335979, GF120918 and Biricodar-Vx-710 suggest
  that R41 and R49/R45 is a must match site with spatial distance of 11 Å. E-pharmacophores
  of all active inhibitors have been given in Fig. 5S.\n\n\n\nDocked conformaton of
  piperine and ADP and docked conformation of ADP AMP-PNP and ATP showing that either
  of the two conformations could be achived by aromatic ring of purine separated by
  distance of 11.026 Å. This explains piperine might be competiting with the ADP/ATP
  during efflux process.\n\n\n(a) E-pharmacophore and binding mode of piperine aligned
  with ADP; E-pharmacophore and binding mode of ATP, ADP and AMP-PNP, showing conformation
  of purine moiety which could take either of two conformations\n\n\n\nP-gp plays
  a significant role in the bioavailability of several drugs mainly cytotoxic hydrophobic
  and anticancerous drugs. Cell viability/cell cytotoxicity assay in the presence
  of piperine in MDCK cell line has shown that piperine treated cells are more viable
  than untreated cells. It indicates that piperine is not toxic even at higher doses
  and has survival benefits in loss of growth media. Effect of piperine was also studied
  in MCF-7, U87/U373, where it has not shown any undesirable effect upto 100 μM. Piperine
  treatment causes accumulation of fluorescent dye rhodamine as shown by fluorescence
  microscopy and fluorescent activated cell sorter. These finding indicate that piperine
  might be competing with ATP or binding in close vicinity of ATP binding site like
  steroids and flavonoids .\n\nPDB BLAST for human P-gp reference sequence  was performed.
  PDB ID 3G60 and 3G5U has shown query coverage of 99 % and zero e-value but these
  structures do not get complexed with nucleotide. Thereby available human X-ray crystallographic
  P-gp structures are unable to provide actual conformation of NBD domain, its cavity
  and binding mode of ATP/ADP. Hence to obtain a 3D structure of human P-gp complexed
  with nucleotide it was modeled, using 2HYD as template. It was modeled with an overall
  quality factor of 92.032. However identity of human and bacterial efflux protein
  is 34 %, but have very high positive 53 % score. This is why the obtained modeled
  structure has very high accuracy.\n\nModeling of nucleotide binding site has shown
  a huge cavity of  which can accommodate inhibitors of high molecular weight along
  with ATP. Steroids and flavonoids like molecule have affinity to the vicinal site
  of ATP binding sites reported by Di Pietro et al. and Conseil et al. . Docking with
  glide and AutoDock has shown that most of the 3rd generation inhibitors and P-gp
  inhibitor of clinical use, i.e., biricodar dock well with higher scores than most
  of the 1st and 2nd generation inhibitors at NBD domain. It indicates that these
  inhibitors do bind at ATP binding site of NBD of P-gp and inhibit efflux. In order
  to find out whether piperine also binds at NBD domain of P-gp, it was docked and
  it was found that amino acid residues lying 3-4Ǻ close to NBD are comparable with
  ADP, ATP, ADP-PNP complexed with P-gp protein. Significant amino acids residues
  in docked conformations at the nucleotide binding site indicate that molecules have
  effective interaction with NBD. Higher docking score suggests that the molecule
  could be considered as lead molecule and this active entity could be used for development
  of the inhibitors of next generations.\n\nDocking simulation with glide-SP/XP module
  has shown that ligands do not dock at NBD site. AutoDock also does not show docking
  at NBD for these ligands except clarithromycin tacrolimus with very poor docking
  and binding energies. These molecules, having macrocylic rings with high molecular
  weight, might be possibly binding to the channel of cytosolic transmembrane domain
  of P-gp; thereby plugging the efflux passage of P-gp substrates. Docking study of
  P-gp inhibitors close to the ATP binding site has shown that these share common
  residue at the binding site as indicated by the residues in the X-ray crystallographic
  structure. Some 1st generation inhibitors have shown single mode of binding, i.e.,
  all the conformers bind in a single mode.\n\nHowever, there are several reports
  and co-crystallized structure PDB ID indicates that inhibition of efflux through
  P-gp is due to binding of the P-gp inhibitor at TMD domain of protein. Hence these
  inhibitors were docked at the TMD domain of P-gp at the centeroid of ligand complexed
  in TMD domain via Glide module(SP and XP) of Schrodinger. The docking scores are
  not in favor of 3rd generation inhibitors. Docking study indicates that NBD is a
  site of inhibitor binding while TMD domains, which make passage/channel for the
  efflux of P-gp substrates. Clarithromycin, Tacrolimus, Valinomycin, and Erthromycin
  do not dock at NBD or have very poor docking scores of these ligands which indicates
  that these molecules do not bind at NBD domain and higher docking score at TMD domain
  indicates that these molecules might be occluded somewhere in the TMD passage thereby
  inhibiting efflux of P-gp substrates.\n\nDocked conformation of piperine has shown
  that it binds with the consensus sequence, i.e., residues of walker A/P loops which
  also participate in the binding of α and β-phosphates or di and tri-nucleotides
  of ADP/ATP. Loop contains invariant Gln stabilizes P-gp ATP complex, which is thought
  to be attacking at ATP nucleotide. Histidine-1232 residue participating in binding
  of piperine might be interfering with the polarization of water molecule. Piperine
  docked at the NBD2 site binds with consensus sequence and its opposite linker region.
  Docked conformation of piperine has shown that it binds with Walker A and Walker
  C consensus sequences. Binding of piperine might be competing with ATP which is
  required for energy coupled efflux of its substrate.\n\nE-pharmacophore feature
  of the cluster-1 suggests that one negative and an aromatic feature with the spatial
  distance of 11–13 Å is needed to be a class of absolute Pg-p inhibitors that could
  be analogs of ADP/ATP. Negative feature is a center where γ and β phosphate groups
  of ATP bind to the receptor and get hydrolyzed to ADP for efflux of P-gp substrate.
  The aromatic features are a must match site occupied by all cluster groups) and.
  E-pharmacophore of verpamil and ADP has shown negative center N37 = −1.45 and N38
  = −5.48; Donor: D20 = −1.60 and D19 = −1.59, Aromatic: R49 = −0.89, R46 = −0.79
  two each and one acceptor site A18 = −0.51. Among these sites two aromatic features
  are common for all inhibitors. Based on the docking score at NBD as well as TMD
  and E-pharmacophore it could be concluded that verapamil binds to the NBD domain.
  E-pharmacophore feature of the inhibitors of highest docking score, i.e., LY335979,
  GF120918 and Biricodar-Vx-710 suggest that R41 and R49/R45 are a must match site
  with spatial distance of 11 Å\n\nE-pharmacophores of all inhibitors have been shown
  in Fig. 5S. The scores of features R177, R155, R164, R118, R162, are −2.40, −145,
  −1.25, −1.77, −0.79, and −0.73 respectively and represent all the clusters. If a
  molecule satisfies the R177 and either of the R155 or R164 feature it could be a
  potential inhibitor. The R177 and R164 are also pharmacophoric features of Bircodar,
  a 3rd generation inhibitor preferred by clinicians to enhance the bioavailability
  of several substrates. R177 and R164 are a most preferred site for purine ring of
  ATP/ADP which could bind at either R177 or R164 site of NBD domain. This is also
  the case of other 3rd generation of inhibitors GF120918 and LY335979 and several
  other first generations of inhibitors nicardpine, amidarone, reserpine, verapamil,
  OC- OC144-093 and ketaconazole.\n\nE-pharmacophores have shown that ATP/ADP and
  piperine have a similar mode of binding. Binding of piperine to the NBD site share
  common residues like other P-gp inhibitors and the entire docked conformers bind
  in a single mode given by both docking methods used in this study. These findings
  explain the observation of Shoba et al., i.e., why piperine enhances bioavailability
  of curcumin by 2000 %.\n\n\n\nPiperine has shown survival benefits over untreated
  MDCK cell line and also induces accumulation of P-gp’s substrate rhodamine. Higher
  docking and binding scores of 2nd/3rd generation inhibitors in comparison to 1st
  generation inhibitors suggest that nucleotide binding domain is the only site for
  P-gp inhibitors except macrocyclic inhibitors. Higher scores of 3rd generation inhibitors
  justify why these are so called 3rd generation inhibitors. Therefore it was concluded
  that P-gp inhibitors could be classified as first; inhibitors that bind at NBD domain
  second; inhibitors which probably bind in the transmembrane domain blocking the
  passage of efflux channel. Crystallized complex of P-gp with ADP, ATP, and AMP-PNP
  and docked-complex of piperine share common amino acids at the binding site confirming
  that piperine also binds in close proximity to nucleotide binding domain. All these
  findings suggest that P-gp inhibitors bind in the vicinity of ATP binding site.
  Considering the E-pharmacophore and structural features of piperine and active entity
  of other inhibitors, which have shown better or equivalent docking scores, could
  be taken for the development for next generation of P-gp inhibitors. As a conclusion
  most potent P-gp inhibitors can be developed based on piperine as a base molecule.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
