  A major part of the wineries wastes is composed of grape stems which are discarded
  mainly in open fields and cause environmental problems due mainly to their high
  polyphenolic content. The grape stem extracts use as a source of high added value
  polyphenols presents great interest because this combines a profitable venture with
  environmental protection close to wine-producing zones. In the present study, at
  first, the Total Polyphenolic Content and the polyphenolic composition of grape
  stem extracts from four different Greek Vitis vinifera varieties were determined
  by HPLC methods. Afterwards, the grape stem extracts were examined for their ability
  to inhibit growth of colon, breast, renal and thyroid cancer cells. The cancer cells
  were exposed to the extracts for 72 h and the effects on cell growth were evaluated
  using the SRB assay. The results indicated that all extracts inhibited cell proliferation,
  with IC50 values of 121-230 Î¼g/ml, 121-184 Î¼g/ml, 175-309 Î¼g/ml, 159-314 Î¼g/ml,
  180-225 Î¼g/ml and 134-&gt;400 Î¼g/ml. This is the first study presenting the inhibitory
  activity of grape stem extracts against growth of colon, breast, renal and thyroid
  cancer cells.'
