  Based on observational studies, it appears that soy food consumption provides protection
  against breast cancer primarily in Asian but not in Western populations. Given the
  problems in examining the effects of isoflavones directly in the human mammary gland,
  this review describes epidemiologic studies that investigated the association with
  biomarkers reflecting hormonal activity of isoflavones, in particular sex steroid
  levels, mammographic densities, nipple aspirate fluid, and tissue specimens from
  biopsies or surgeries. Three possible mechanisms that may be responsible for ethnic-specific
  health effects from these compounds are discussed: genetic variation in metabolic
  enzymes, timing of exposure, and intestinal metabolism by microbiota. Only a limited
  number of comparative studies and even fewer nutritional interventions have examined
  effects and addressed differences in biomarkers between Asian and Western populations.
  Investigations that looked at estrogens and mammographic densities as endpoints
  observed some associations in Asian women that were not seen in Caucasians. On the
  other hand, the low rate of nipple aspirate fluid production and a lack of breast
  tissue studies make it impossible to evaluate effects of isoflavones on these biomarkers
  in Asian women. Based on the current evidence, it appears likely that the timing
  of exposure is the most important determinant of beneficial health effects from
  soy foods. This may be the result of gut microbiota, which colonize the intestine
  during childhood and facilitates the hydrolysis of glycosides and the formation
  of equol from dadzein, a pathway that may result in beneficial health effects. The
  current evidence is insufficient to answer the question whether women of diverse
  ethnic groups experience distinct effects from soy isoflavones in breast tissue,
  but as knowledge about the role of early life nutrition and the development of gut
  microbiota increases, the potential for diverse metabolic pathways of isoflavones
  in individuals with different ethnic backgrounds and dietary exposures may be clarified.'
