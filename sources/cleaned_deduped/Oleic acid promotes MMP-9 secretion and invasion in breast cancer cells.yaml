  Epidemiological and animal studies suggest an association between dietary fatty
  acids and an increase risk of developing breast cancer. Obesity, which is characterized
  by hyperlipidemia and an elevation of circulating free fatty acids, is also associated
  with enhanced cancer risk. In breast cancer cells, the FFA oleic acid induces migration,
  proliferation, prolong survival, invasion, an increase in cellular Ca2+ concentration,
  MEK1/2, ERK1/2, FAK and Src activation. However, the role of OA on MMP-9 secretion
  and invasion has not been studied in detail. We demonstrate here that stimulation
  of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells with 200 μM OA induces an increase on MMP-9 secretion
  through a PKC, Src, and EGFR-dependent pathway, as revealed by gelatin zymography
  assays. Furthermore, microtubule network mediates MMP-9 secretion induced by OA.
  In contrast, OA does not induce an increase on MMP-9 secretion in MCF10A cells,
  whereas it does not induce MMP-9 secretion in MCF12A mammary non-tumorigenic epithelial
  cells. In addition, OA induces invasion through an EGFR, Gi/Go proteins, MMPs, PKC
  and Src-dependent pathway, but it is not able to promote invasion in non-invasive
  MCF-7 breast cancer cells. In summary, our findings demonstrate that OA promotes
  an increase on MMP-9 secretion and invasion through a PKC, Src, and EGFR-dependent
  pathway in breast cancer cells.

  Epidemiological and animal studies suggest an association between dietary fatty
  acids and an increased risk of developing breast cancer . Obesity, which is characterized
  by hyperlipidemia and an elevation of circulating free fatty acids, has been also
  associated with enhanced cancer risk . FFAs are energy source for the body, act
  as signaling molecules, and they bind to nuclear peroxisomal proliferated-activated
  receptors, mediating expression of genes involved in glucose and lipid metabolism.
  However, FFAs also mediate biological effects independent of PPARs, such as proliferation
  and migration .


  GPR40, GPR41, GPR43 and GPR120 are G protein-coupled receptors activated by FFAs.
  GPR40 and GPR120 are receptors for medium and long chain FFAs, whereas GPR41 and
  GPR43 are receptors for short chain FFAs . GPR40 and GPR120 are expressed in MDA-MB-231
  and MCF-7 breast cancer cells and in the mammary non-tumorigenic epithelial cells
  MCF10A . In breast cancer cells, oleic acid induces migration, proliferation, prolong
  survival, invasion, an increase in cellular Ca2+ concentration, MEK1/2, ERK1/2,
  FAK and Src activation . Moreover, arachidonic acid promotes FAK activation and
  cell migration in breast cancer cells and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in
  mammary epithelial cells MCF10A .


  Matrix metalloproteinases are a family of zinc-dependent endopeptidases that collectively
  are capable of degrading all extracellular matrix components, and have been implicated
  in several aspects of tumor progression, including angiogenesis, tumor cell growth
  and invasion through basement membranes and interstitial matrices . MMPs gene family
  consists of at least 20 members and is subgrouped into different types based on
  sequence characteristic and substrate specificity . MMPs are synthesized and secreted
  as zymogens that require activation to become proteolytically active. Thus, activation
  is a critical step in the regulation of MMP-dependent proteolytic activity. In particular,
  MMP-2 and MMP-9 are associated with tumor progression and metastasis due to their
  ability to degrade type IV collagen, the main component of BM, and their elevated
  expression in malignant tumors. In breast cancer, both gelatinases are highly expressed,
  and is suggested that play an important role in breast cancer invasion, metastasis
  and tumor angiogenesis .


  In the present study, we demonstrate that OA promotes MMP-9 secretion through a
  PKC, Src and EGFR-dependent pathway, whereas it induces invasion via an EGFR, Gi/Go
  proteins, MMPs, PKC and Src-dependent pathway in breast cancer cells. In contrast,
  OA does not induce an increase on MMP-9 secretion in MCF10A cells, and it does not
  induce MMP-9 secretion in mammary non-tumorigenic epithelial cells MCF12A.






  OA sodium salt, epidermal growth factor, phorbol 12,13-dibutirate, GF109203X, SU6656
  and Pertussis toxin were obtained from Sigma. Fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin
  was obtained from Research Organics. AG1478, PP2 and GM6001 were obtained from Calbiochem.
  MMP-9 monoclonal antibody H-129 was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Actin
  monoclonal Ab was kindly provided for Dr. Manuel Hernandez. Basement membrane matrix
  was obtained from BD Biosciences. Free fatty acid quantification kit was obtained
  from BioVision. ECL reagent was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. All other reagents
  used were of the highest grade available.




  The human breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 were cultured in Dulbecco’s
  modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 3.7 g/L sodium bicarbonate, 5% fetal bovine
  serum and antibiotics, in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 and 95% air
  at 37°C.


  The non-tumorigenic epithelial cell lines MCF12A and MCF10A were cultured in DMEM/F12
  medium supplemented with 5% FBS, 0.4 μg/ml hydrocortisone, 4.18 μg/ml insulin, 10
  ng/ml recombinant EGF and antibiotics, in a humidified atmosphere containing 5%
  CO2 and 95% air at 37°C.


  For experimental purposes, breast cancer cells were serum-starved for 12 h before
  treatment with inhibitors and/or OA, whereas MCF12A and MCF10A cells were starved
  for 4 h in DMEM without FBS, EGF, insulin and hydrocortisone before treatment with
  inhibitors and/or OA.




  Confluent cultures were washed twice with DMEM without FBS, equilibrated in the
  same medium at 37°C for at least 30 min, and then treated with PDB, inhibitors and/or
  OA bound to FAF-BSA for the times or concentrations indicated. BSA-OA was prepared
  by stirring OA sodium salt at 37°C with 5% FAF-BSA as described before . After being
  adjusted to pH 7.4, the solution was filtered through a 0.22 µm filter and the fatty
  acid concentration was measured using a fatty acid assay kit. When BSA-OA was added
  to serum-free culture medium, the final concentration of BSA was adjusted to 0.005%.




  Cells were stimulated and conditioned medium was collected and concentrated using
  chemicom tubes. Moreover, cells were lysed and cell lysates were analyzed by western
  blotting with anti-actin Ab as loading control. Proteolytic activity was assayed
  on conditioned medium using gelatin-substrate gels as described previously . Briefly,
  same volume of non-heated samples were mixed with sample buffer, without reducing
  agent and applied to 8% acrylamide gels copolymerized with gelatin at 1 mg/ml. After
  electrophoresis at 72 V for 2 h, the gels were rinsed twice in 2.5% Triton X-100
  to remove SDS and then incubated in 50 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.4 and 5 mM CaCl2 assay buffer
  at 37°C for 24 h. Gels were fixed and stained with 0.25% Coomassie Brilliant Blue
  G-250 in 10% acetic acid and 30% methanol. Proteolytic activity was detected as
  clear bands against the background stain of undigested substrate in the gel.




  Equal amounts of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE using 8% separating gels followed
  by transfer to nitrocellulose membranes. After transfer, membranes were blocked
  using 5% non-fat dried milk in phosphate buffered saline pH 7.2, and incubated overnight
  at 4°C with the primary Ab as indicated. The membranes were washed three times with
  PBS/0.1% Tween 20, and then incubated with secondary Abs for 2 h at 22°C. After
  washing three times with PBS/0.1% Tween 20, the immunoreactive bands were visualized
  using ECL detection reagents. Autoradiograms were scanned and the labeled bands
  were quantified using the Sigma-Gel software.




  Matrigel invasion assays were performed by the modified Boyden chamber method in
  24-well plates containing 12 cell culture inserts with 8 μm pore size. Briefly,
  30 μl BD Matrigel was added into culture inserts and kept overnight at 37°C to form
  a semisolid matrix. Untreated or treated cells with inhibitors were plated at 1
  × 105 cells per insert in serum-free medium on the top chamber. The lower chamber
  of transwells contained 600 μl DMEM without or with 200 μM OA. Cells were incubated
  for 48 h at 37°C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Following incubation, cells and matrigel
  on the upper surface of membrane were removed with cotton swabs, and cells on the
  lower surface of membrane were washed and fixed with methanol for 5 min. The number
  of invaded cells was estimated by staining with 0.1% crystal violet in PBS. The
  dye was eluted with 500 μl 10% acetic acid, and the absorbance at 600 nm was measured.
  Background value was obtained from wells without cells.




  Results are expressed as means ± SD. Data were statistically analyzed using one-way
  ANOVA and the pairwise comparisons were performed using Newman-Keuls multiple comparison
  test. Statistical probability of P ; 0.05 was considered significant.






  Since, OA promotes proliferation of breast cancer cells and that MMP-9 is proposal
  to play an important role in breast cancer invasion, metastasis and tumor angiogenesis
  , we decided to examine whether OA induces MMP-9 secretion in breast cancer cells.
  First, to determine whether OA induces MMP-9 secretion, MDA-MB-231 cells were treated
  with 200 μM OA for various times and subsequently, conditioned medium was harvested.
  The medium was subjected to gelatin zymography and Western-blotting using an Ab
  against MMP-9. Moreover, cells were lysed and cell lysates were analyzed by western
  blotting with anti-actin Ab as loading control. As shown in Fig. 1a, treatment of
  cells with OA induced a marked increase on MMP-9 secretion that reached a maximum
  at 20 h of treatment. In contrast, MDA-MB-231 cells have a constitutive secretion
  of MMP-2 and treatment with OA did not induce an increase on its secretion. It has
  been described that PKC strongly stimulates MMP-9 expression and secretion . Then,
  a positive control of MMP-9 secretion was prepared by treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells
  with 100 ng/ml PDB, a strong activator of PKC, for 24 h. Moreover, OA also induced
  MMP-9 secretion in a concentration-dependent manner. Western blotting with anti-actin
  Ab of cell lysates confirmed that similar number of cells was present in the absence
  or presence of OA.



  Oleic acid induces MMP-9 secretion in breast cancer cells. a MDA-MB-231 cells were
  treated without or with 200 μM oleic acid for various times as indicated. b MDA-MB-231
  cells were treated for 20 h without or with various concentrations of OA as indicated.
  Conditioned medium was obtained, and MMP-9 secretion was analyzed on conditioned
  medium using gelatin-substrate gels and western blotting using anti-MMP-9 Ab. c
  MCF-7 cells were treated without or with 200 μM OA for various times as indicated.
  d, e MCF10A and MCF12A cells were treated without or with 200 μM OA for various
  times as indicated. Conditioned medium was obtained, and MMP-9 secretion was analyzed
  on conditioned medium using gelatin-substrate gels. Cell lysates were obtained,
  and equal volumes were analyzed by western blotting using anti-actin Ab as loading
  control. A positive control of MMP-9 secretion was included, which was prepared
  by treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with 100 ng/ml PDB for 24 h. The results shown
  are representative of at least three independent experiments


  In order to substantiate further our results, we examined whether OA promotes MMP-9
  secretion in MCF-7 breast cancer cells and in the non-tumorigenic epithelial cells
  MCF10A and MCF12A. Cultures of MCF-7, MCF10A and MCF12A cells were stimulated with
  200 μM OA for various times and subsequently, conditioned medium was harvested.
  The medium was subjected to gelatin zymography. In agreement with our previous results,
  our findings showed that stimulation of MCF-7 cells with OA induced MMP-9 secretion
  in a time-dependent manner. In contrast, in the non-tumorigenic epithelial cell
  line MCF10A, untreated cells showed a little bit of MMP-9 secretion and treatment
  with OA did not induce an increase on MMP-9 secretion, whereas in MCF12A cells,
  treatment with OA also did not induce MMP-9 secretion.




  Oleic acid promotes Src activation in MDA-MB-231 cells, and it induces EGFR activation
  in endothelial cells . In breast cancer cells, type IV collagen promotes MMP-9 secretion
  via an Src-dependent pathway, fibroblast growth factor and heregulin-beta-1 mediate
  MMP-9 secretion through a PKC-dependent pathway, and EGF induces MMP-9 expression
  in SKBR3 breast cancer cells . To examine the involvement of Src, PKC and EGFR activity
  on MMP-9 secretion induced by OA, we studied the effect of SU6656, GF-I and AG1478,
  which are selective inhibitors that have been used previously to inhibit the activity
  of Src, PKC and EGFR, respectively, in MDA-MB-231 cells . MDA-MB-231 cells were
  treated for 30 min with 10 μM SU6656, 300 nM AG1478 or 3.4 μM GF-I and then stimulated
  with 200 μM OA for another 20 h. Conditioned medium was harvested and subjected
  to gelatin-zymography. Our results showed that treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with
  Src, PKC and EGFR inhibitors completely prevented MMP-9 secretion.



  Oleic acid induces MMP-9 secretion through an EGFR, Src, PKC and Gi/Go proteins-dependent
  pathway. a, b MDA-MB-231 cells were treated for 30 min in the absence or presence
  of 10 μM SU6656, 3.4 μM GF-I or 300 nM AG1478 as indicated and then stimulated without
  or with 200 μM OA for 20 h. c MDA-MB-231 cells were treated for 12 h in the absence
  or presence of 100 ng/ml PTX as indicated and then stimulated without or with 200
  μM OA for 20 h. d MDA-MB-231 cells were treated for 1 h in the absence or presence
  of 30 µg/ml cycloheximide as indicated and then stimulated without or with 200 μM
  OA for 20 h. Conditioned medium was obtained, and MMP-9 secretion was analyzed on
  conditioned medium using gelatin-substrate gels. Cell lysates were obtained and
  equal volumes were analyzed by western blotting using anti-actin Ab as loading control.
  A positive control of MMP-9 secretion was included, which was prepared by treatment
  of MDA-MB-231 cells with 100 ng/ml PDB for 24 h. The results shown are representative
  of at least three independent experiments


  Since, OA is known to act via GPCRs and that GPR40 is coupled with both the Gi/Go
  and Gq families in MCF-7 cells , we studied the effect of PTX, an inhibitor of Gi/Go
  proteins , on MMP-9 secretion. MDA-MB-231 cells were treated for 12 h in the absence
  or presence of 100 ng/ml PTX and then stimulated with 200 μM OA for another 20 h.
  Conditioned medium was harvested and subjected to gelatin-zymography. As shown in
  Fig. 2c, treatment with PTX did not inhibit MMP-9 secretion induced by OA.


  In order to determine whether OA induces MMP-9 secretion through a protein synthesis-dependent
  pathway, we studied the effect of cycloheximide, an antibiotic that its main biological
  activity is translation inhibition in eukaryotes resulting in inhibition of proteins
  synthesis , on MMP-9 secretion. Confluent cultures of MDA-MB-231 cells were treated
  for 1 h with 30 µg/ml cycloheximide and then stimulated with 200 μM OA for another
  20 h. Conditioned medium was harvested and subjected to gelatin-zymography. Our
  results showed that treatment with cycloheximide inhibit MMP-9 secretion induced
  by OA.




  In order to determine the contribution of cytoskeleton on MMP-9 secretion, we determined
  the effect of cytochalasin D and colchicine on MMP-9 secretion induced by OA. Cytochalasin
  D promotes depolymerization of actin fibers, whereas colchicine is a selective inhibitor
  of tubulin polymerization . MDA-MB-231 cells were treated for 2 h in the absence
  or presence of 2.4 μM cytochalasin D or 10 μM colchicine and then stimulated with
  200 μM OA for another 20 h. Conditioned medium was harvested and subjected to gelatin-zymography.
  Our results showed that treatment with colchicine completely prevented MMP-9 secretion,
  and cytochalasin D did not inhibit MMP-9 secretion induced by OA.



  Role of cytoskeleton on MMP-9 secretion. a MDA-MB-231 cells were treated for 2 h
  in the absence or presence of 10 µM colchicine, as indicated and then stimulated
  without or with 200 μM OA for 20 h. b MDA-MB-231 cells were treated for 2 h in the
  absence or presence of 2.4 µM cytochalasin D, as indicated and then stimulated without
  or with 200 μM OA for 20 h. Conditioned medium was obtained, and MMP-9 secretion
  was analyzed on conditioned medium using gelatin-substrate gels. Cell lysates were
  obtained and equal volumes were analyzed by western blotting using anti-actin Ab
  as loading control. A positive control of MMP-9 secretion was included, which was
  prepared by treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with 100 ng/ml PDB for 24 h. The results
  shown are representative of at least three independent experiments




  Since, Src modulates migration and invasion and that OA induces Src activation in
  breast cancer cells , we examined whether OA promotes invasion and the role of Src
  kinase activity in MDA-MB-231 cells. MDA-MB-231 cells were untreated or treated
  for 30 min with PP2 and SU6656, which are selective inhibitors of Src family kinases
  and have been used previously to inhibit Src kinase family members activity in MDA-MB-231
  cells , and then cells were loaded onto the upper chamber and stimulated with 200
  μM OA for 48 h. Cells that penetrated the membranes were fixed and stained. As shown
  in Fig. 4a, b, MDA-MB-231 cells showed a clear invasion, whereas cells treated with
  PP2 and SU6656 were not able to produce invasion. In contrast, OA did not induce
  invasion on non-invasive MCF-7 breast cancer cells.



  Oleic acid induces invasiveness through an EGFR and Src-dependent pathway. a–c MDA-MB-231
  cells held in suspension were treated for 30 min in the absence or presence of 10
  μM PP2, 10 μM SU6656 or 300 nM AG1478, as indicated and then cells were plated on
  the top of matrigel and treated with 200 μM OA for 48 h. d MCF-7 cells held in suspension
  were plated on the top of matrigel and treated with 200 μM OA for 48 h. Cell invasion
  was evaluated after 48 h of incubation. The graphs represent the mean ± SD of at
  least three independent experiments and are expressed as the percentage of maximum
  invaded cells. Asterisks denote comparisons made to control cultures.  P &lt; 0.05
  and  P &lt; 0.005 by one-way ANOVA


  Since, EGFR and αvβ3 integrin promote carcinoma cell invasion and metastasis and
  that OA promotes proliferation through an EGFR-dependent pathway in breast cancer
  cells , we studied the role of EGFR on invasiveness induced by OA in MDA-MB-231
  cells. MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with 300 nM AG1478, and then cells were loaded
  onto the upper chamber and stimulated with 200 μM OA for 48 h. As shown in Fig.
  4c, inhibition of EGFR activity prevented cell invasion induced by OA.




  MMPs are implicated in tumor progression, including invasion through BM and interstitial
  matrices , FGF-2 and TPA induces MMP-9 secretion through a PKC activation pathway
  . We studied the role of MMPs and PKC activity on invasiveness induced by OA in
  MDA-MB-231 cells. MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with 10 µM GM6001 or 3.4 μM GF-I,
  which are selective inhibitors of MMPs and PKC activity, respectively, and have
  been used previously to inhibit MMPs and PKC activity in MDA-MB-231 cells , and
  then cells were loaded onto the upper chamber and stimulated with 200 μM OA for
  48 h. Cells that penetrated the membranes were fixed and stained. Our results showed
  that inhibition of MMPs activity prevented invasion, whereas treatment with PKC
  inhibitor partly prevented invasion induced by OA.

  a, b MDA-MB-231 cells held in suspension were treated for 30 min in the absence
  or presence of 10 μM GM6001 or 3.4 μM GF-I as indicated and then cells were plated
  on the top of matrigel and treated with 200 μM OA for 48 h. c MDA-MB-231 cells held
  in suspension were treated for 12 h in the absence or presence of 100 ng/ml PTX
  and then cells were plated on the top of matrigel, and treated with 200 μM OA for
  48 h. Cell invasion was evaluated after 48 h of incubation. The graphs represent
  the mean ± SD of at least three independent experiments and are expressed as the
  percentage of maximum invaded cells. Asterisks denote comparisons made to control
  cultures.  P &lt; 0.05 and  P &lt; 0.005 by one-way ANOVA


  OA acts via GPR40 pathway, and it is coupled with both Gi/Go and Gq in MCF-7 cells
  , whereas AA induces cell migration through a Gi/Go-dependent pathway in MDA-MB-231
  cells . We studied the role of Gi/Go proteins on invasiveness induced by OA in MDA-MB-231
  cells. MDA-MB-231 cells were treated for 12 h with 100 ng/ml PTX, an inhibitor of
  Gi/Go proteins , and then cells were loaded onto the upper chamber and stimulated
  with 200 μM OA for 48 h. As illustrated in Fig. 5c, treatment with PTX inhibited
  invasion in MDA-MB-231 cells stimulated with OA.




  Numerous studies in women suggest that certain dietary factors such as higher intake
  of fat and meat increase the risk of breast cancer, whereas obesity has been associated
  with enhanced cancer risk . However, the role of FFAs, such as OA, in tumor progression
  through regulation of cell migration, MMPs secretion, invasion, epithelial to mesenchymal
  transition and angiogenesis has not been studied in detail.


  Type IV collagen is the main component of BM and is the first protein that must
  be degraded in order to produce invasion and metastasis. BM is degraded mostly by
  MMP-2 and MMP-9, and it has been proposed that these MMPs play a critical a role
  in the conversion of in situ cancer to invasive lesions . Furthermore, OA induces
  proliferation through a MMPs-dependent pathway and invasion in breast cancer cells
  . Consequently, we considered the possibility that OA regulates MMP-9 secretion
  and therefore invasion through a MMPs-dependent pathway in breast cancer cells.
  In the present study, we determined that OA promotes MMP-9 secretion through a PKC,
  Src and EGFR-dependent pathway in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Our findings also
  show that Gi/Go proteins do not participate on MMP-9 secretion induced by OA, because
  treatment with PTX does not prevent MMP-9 secretion. Since OA promotes proliferation
  in the breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 and it is mediated at least
  in part through GPR40 and that GPR40 is coupled with Gi/Go and Gq , our findings
  suggest that OA induces MMP-9 secretion via GPR40 activation coupled with Gq or
  that OA induces GPR120 activation, because GPR120 is the receptor for medium and
  long chain FFAs, such as OA . In addition, our results show that protein synthesis
  is required for MMP-9 secretion induced by OA. It suggests that OA induces up-regulation
  of MMP-9 expression and/or that OA induces synthesis of proteins involved on MMP-9
  secretion.


  Human non-tumorigenic mammary epithelial cells MCF10A have a constitutive secretion
  of MMP-9 and treatment with OA does not promote an increase on its secretion. Previously,
  it has been reported that untreated MCF10A cells constitutively secrete MMP-9 .
  It is in agreement with the constitutive secretion that we detected. In addition,
  OA does not induce MMP-9 secretion on non-tumorigenic mammary epithelial cells MCF12A.
  Since GPR40 and GPR120 are expressed in MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 and MCF10A cells , we
  propose that these receptors are activated by treatment with OA in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231
  breast cancer cells, but they are not activated in the human breast epithelial cells
  MCF10A and MCF12A cells. Furthermore, our findings also suggest that OA may contribute
  to invasiveness and therefore metastasis process in breast cancer, because it has
  been suggested that MMP-2 and MMP-9 play a pivotal role in metastasis and invasion
  in breast cancer . In contrast to these results, previous reports show that OA induces
  inhibition of MMP-2 activity in human bronchial epithelial cells, and a reduction
  on MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity in mice bearing implants of metastatic colon carcinoma
  cells . We propose that OA mediates different signal transduction pathways and cellular
  responses on the diverse types of human cancers.


  MT-MMP-1 plays a pivotal role in tumor cell invasion and it associate with p27RF-Rho,
  which enhances Rho activation and therefore regulates actin structures . In gastric
  tumor cells, phospholipase C delta 1 expression inhibit their clonogenicity and
  migration through regulation of cytoskeleton organization . We therefore hypothesize
  that an intact cytoskeleton is required for MMP-9 secretion. Supporting our hypothesis,
  this study demonstrates that integrity of microtubule network is required for MMP-9
  secretion induced by OA. In contrast, actin cytoskeleton is not necessary for MMP-9
  secretion. These results suggest that cytoskeleton play an important role in cell
  invasion by regulation of MMPs secretion, such as MMP-9. In support to our proposal,
  it has been reported that regulation of cytoskeleton is a prerequisite for processes
  like endocytosis, cell motility and cancer cell invasion .


  Previous reports demonstrate that OA induces proliferation, migration and invasion
  in breast cancer cells . We demonstrated here that OA induces invasion through an
  EGFR, PKC, Src, Gi/Go proteins and MMPs-dependent pathway in MDA-MB-231 cells. In
  contrast, OA is not able to induce invasion on the non-invasive MCF-7 breast cancer
  cells. These results strongly suggest that invasion induced by OA is restricted
  to invasive breast cancer cells and they support our proposal that OA may contribute
  to invasiveness and therefore metastasis process in breast cancer.


  Src kinase family members are implicated in adhesion, migration, invasion and survival
  in cancer cells . In human neutrophils, tumor necrosis factor mediates MMP-9 release
  through a PKC and Src-dependent pathway . Our findings show that OA promotes MMP-9
  secretion an invasion via an Src-dependent pathway in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells.
  In agreement with our findings, previous reports show that type IV collagen promotes
  an increase on MMP-9 secretion through an Src-dependent pathway in breast cancer
  cells .


  Increased levels of PKC have been associated with malignant transformation in breast
  cancer cell lines, while a positive correlation between elevated PKC levels and
  invasive potential of breast cancer cells lines is suggested . Moreover, OA induces
  glucagon-like-peptide-1 secretion via PCK zeta-dependent pathway on intestinal endocrine
  L cells . In line with this notion, our results demonstrated that OA promotes MMP-9
  secretion and invasion through a PKC-dependent pathway in MDA-MB-231 cells. In agreement
  with our results, 12-O-tretradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, an activator of PKC, induces
  expression and secretion of MMP-9 in MCF-7 cells , whereas PKC epsilon mediates
  cell invasion in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 breast cancer cells .


  EGFR and Her-2 overexpression correlates with a reduction on survival and induction
  of invasion and metastasis in malignant breast cancer. In particular, EGF induces
  MMP-9 secretion in ovarian and lung cancer . We demonstrated that OA promotes MMP-9
  secretion and invasion through an EGFR-dependent pathway. Supporting our results,
  we previously demonstrate that OA promotes proliferation through an EGFR-dependent
  pathway in breast cancer cells . Since, Src family kinases are mediators of GPCR-induced
  EGFR transactivation , and that OA promotes Src activation in MCF-7 cells , we propose
  that OA mediates MMP-9 secretion an invasion through an EGFR transactivation-dependent
  pathway. Our findings also show that OA mediates invasion through a pathway coupled
  with Gi/Go proteins, because inhibition of Gi/Go proteins by treatment with PTX
  inhibit invasion. It is in agreement with previous reports showing that OA promotes
  proliferation and an increase in cellular Ca2+ concentration through GPR40 activation
  via Gi/Go proteins in breast cancer cells . We propose that OA induces invasion
  via GPR40 coupled with Gi/Go and/or OA induces GPR120 activation. In addition, during
  invasion process, cells induce the formation of invadipodia protrutions, which are
  actin microdomains rich in associated-actin proteins and MMPs . In line with this
  notion, we demonstrated that OA induces invasion through a MMPs-dependent pathway.


  In conclusion, our findings demonstrated that OA induces MMP-9 secretion through
  a PKC, Src and EGFR-dependent pathway, whereas it induces invasion via an EGFR,
  Gi/Go proteins, MMPs, PKC and Src-dependent pathway in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer
  cells. These findings strongly suggest that OA may have an important role in the
  invasion process and metastasis in breast cancer.
