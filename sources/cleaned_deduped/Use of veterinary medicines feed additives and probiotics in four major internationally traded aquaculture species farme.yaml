  Antimicrobials, parasiticides, feed additives and probiotics are used in Asian aquaculture
  to improve the health status of the cultured organisms and to prevent or treat disease
  outbreaks. Detailed information on the use of such chemicals in Asian aquaculture
  is limited, but of crucial importance for the evaluation of their potential human
  health and environmental risks. This study reports the outcomes of a survey on the
  use of chemical and biological products in 252 grow-out aquaculture farms and 56
  farm supply shops in four countries in Asia. The survey was conducted between 2011
  and 2012, and included nine aquaculture farm groups: Penaeid shrimp farms in Bangladesh,
  China, Thailand and Vietnam; Macrobrachium prawn farms, and farms producing both
  Penaeid shrimps and Macrobrachium prawns in Bangladesh; tilapia farms in China and
  Thailand; and Pangasius catfish farms in Vietnam. Results were analysed with regard
  to the frequencies of use of active ingredients and chemical classes, reported dosages,
  and calculated applied mass relative to production. A range of farm management and
  farm characteristics were used as independent variables to explain observed chemical
  use patterns reported by farmers within each group. Sixty different veterinary medicinal
  ingredients were recorded. The use of antibiotic treatments was found to be significantly
  higher in the Vietnamese Pangasius farms. However, total quantities of antibiotics,
  relative to production, applied by the Pangasius farmers were comparable or even
  lower than those reported for other animal production commodities. Semi-intensive
  and intensive shrimp farms in China, Thailand and Vietnam showed a decrease in the
  use of antibiotic treatments. These farm groups utilised the largest amount of chemicals
  relative to production, with feed additives and plant extracts, probiotics, and
  disinfectants, being the most used chemical classes, mainly for disease prevention.
  The surveyed farmers generally did not exceed recommended dosages of veterinary
  medicines, and nationally or internationally banned compounds were  reported neither
  by the surveyed farmers, nor by the surveyed chemical sellers. Factors underlying
  the observed differences in chemical use patterns differed widely amongst farm groups,
  and geographical location was found to be the only factor influencing chemical ingredient
  application patterns in the majority of the studied farm groups.'
