  Meat from Holstein and crossbred organic and conventional dairy steers were evaluated
  and compared for fatty acid profiles, meat quality, sensory attributes, and consumer
  acceptance. Bull calves were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 replicated groups: conventional,
  organic, or grass-fed organic and were born at the University of Minnesota West
  Central Research and Outreach Center between March and May 2011. The CONV steers
  were fed a diet that contained 80% concentrate and 20% forage, and ORG steers were
  fed a diet of organic corn, organic corn silage, and organic protein supplement.
  Furthermore, ORG steers consumed at least 30% of diet dry matter of high-quality
  organic pasture during the grazing season. The GRS steers consumed 100% forage from
  pasture during the grazing season and high-quality hay or hay silage during the
  nongrazing season. The ORG steers had fat that was greater in oleic acid than the
  GRS and CONV steers. The GRS steers were lower for monounsaturated fat than the
  ORG and CONV steers. Furthermore, the GRS steers tended to have greater n-3 fat
  and had lower n-6 fat than the ORG and CONV steers. Consequently, the GRS steers
  had a lower n-6-to-n-3 fat ratio than the ORG and CONV steers. The GRS steers had
  steaks that were not different for Warner-Bratzler shear force than ORG steaks;
  however, the GRS steaks tended to have greater shear force than the CONV steaks.
  The 3 steer group had steaks that were not different for color brightness and yellowness/blueness
  values; however, the GRS steaks had lower redness/greenness values than CONV steaks.
  For sensory attributes, no differences were observed for ORG and CONV steers for
  overall consumer liking of the beef; however, the GRS steers had the lowest overall
  liking among beef consumers. The ORG steers had greater flavor liking than the GRS
  and CONV steers. Conversely, the GRS steers had the highest scores for off-flavor
  compared with the ORG and CONV steers. The results of the current study suggest
  that a potential market may exist for organic grass-fed dairy steers in the United
  States, but quality and consistency of the beef needs to be improved.'
