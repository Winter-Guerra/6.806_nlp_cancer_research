  controls TPA-induced MMP-9 expression through the NF-B signaling pathway but not
  AP-1 in MCF-7 breast cance.md
text: '


  Sulforaphane  is an isothiocyanate found in some cruciferous vegetables, especially
  broccoli. Sulforaphane has been shown to display anti-cancer properties against
  various cancer cell lines. Matrix metalloproteinase-9, which degrades the extracellular
  matrix, plays an important role in cancer cell invasion. In this study, we investigated
  the effect of sulforaphane on 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate -induced MMP-9
  expression and cell invasion in MCF-7 cells. TPA-induced MMP-9 expression and cell
  invasion were decreased by sulforaphane treatment. TPA substantially increased NF-B
  and AP-1 DNA binding activity. Pre-treatment with sulforaphane inhibited TPA-stimulated
  NF-B binding activity, but not AP-1 binding activity. In addition, we found that
  sulforaphane suppressed NF-B activation, by inhibiting phosphorylation of IB in
  TPA-treated MCF-7 cells. In this study, we demonstrated that the inhibition of TPA-induced
  MMP-9 expression and cell invasion by sulforaphane was mediated by the suppression
  of the NF-B pathway in MCF-7 cells.'
