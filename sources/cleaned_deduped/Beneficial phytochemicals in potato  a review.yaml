  Potato contains several phytochemicals such as phenolics, flavonoids, polyamines,
  and carotenoids, which are highly desirable in diet because of their beneficial
  effects on human health. The concentration and stability of these constituents are
  affected by several factors such as genotype, agronomic factors, postharvest storage,
  cooking and processing conditions. The advances in analytical techniques have made
  possible the identification and understanding the functions of phytochemicals, particularly
  their antioxidant properties. The potatoes are stored and processed into a variety
  of products before consumption. In the present review, phytochemicals present in
  potatoes, factors affecting their content, stability and health benefits are discussed.

  the health of a large segment of population in the countries where potatoes form
  a substantial part of daily diet.'
