  This study assessed the flesh proximate and lipid composition of two year classes
  and sizes of non-transgenic and transgenic coho salmon that were grown to market
  size in the same rearing environment and on similar commercial feeds. The data also
  assessed land-based commercially raised farmed coho salmon, as well as two other
  species of ocean-raised farmed salmonids, and four species of wild Pacific salmon.
  The largest differences in nutritional content were seen between wild and farmed
  salmon. Farmed salmon contained higher muscle lipid levels and had higher levels
  of eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid relative to wild counterparts.
  Moreover, the farmed fish also contained higher levels of n-6 poly-unsaturated fatty
  acids and a lower omega-3 to omega-6 ratios. There were small differences in nutritional
  content between NT and T coho salmon, but most of these differences were due to
  the lower body weight and consequently lower lipid content in the small T coho salmon
  group. The larger NT coho salmon were very similar in nutritional content to their
  T counterparts. Overall, fish diet composition and rearing location had a much larger
  influence on the flesh nutritional content than did effects of the transgene, and
  all salmon, regardless of source, were found to be rich sources of EPA and DHA.'
