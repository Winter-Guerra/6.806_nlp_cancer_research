  Cherry is still one of the most popular preserve in Turkish cuisine. Cherry has
  been traditionally used for the treatment of inflammatory-related symptoms. Recent
  researches have proved that cherry is a valuable natural source of some important
  bioactive compounds in human health preservation. Evidence suggests that, cherry
  consumption may decrease the risk of chronic diseases and cancer. The aim of the
  present study was to determine the effects of cherry on breast cancer cells lines,
  asymmetric dimethylarginine level and certain multidrug-resistant bacteria. The
  cancer cell proliferation activity and analysis of apoptotic-necrotic cells was
  evaluated by using the 3--2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide and scoring of apoptotic
  cell nuclei. Measurement of ADMA and the minimum inhibitory concentration was accomplished
  by HPLC and the micro dilution broth method. The results showed that, extracts of
  cherry exhibit anti-proliferative activity in mammary adenocarcinoma &amp; mouse
  mammary tumor cell breast cancer cells lines as well as induction of apoptosis,
  lower ADMA concentrations in cell cultures treated with cherry extract and antibacterial
  effects against certain multidrug-resistant bacteria in vitro. These findings may
  open new horizons for traditional anti-inflammatory product as prophylactic-therapeutic
  agent from cancer, cardiovascular diseases and multidrug-resistant infections. '
