  Maté, a hot infusion of Ilex paraguayensis, is a beverage largely consumed in Southeast
  Latin America, including during pregnancy. To assess the effect of maté drinking
  during pregnancy on preterm and small for gestational age birth, a cross-sectional
  study was done. From January 1st to December 31st, 1993, in the first 24 h after
  delivery, all 5304 mothers giving birth at the hospitals in Pelotas, Southern Brazil,
  were interviewed and several of their characteristics were gathered. Birthweight
  was recorded and gestational age at birth assessed using the Dubowitz score. All
  5189 single births were analyzed. The prevalence of SGA and preterm birth was 8.0
  and 9.1%, respectively. Maté intake at least once a week during the entire pregnancy
  period was reported by ∼68% of the mothers. Crude analyses showed a 30% increase
  in the risk of SGA among daily maté drinkers compared with nonconsumers, whereas
  no statistical association was detected with preterm births. After controlling for
  confounders, the significance of the association with SGA birth no longer held and
  the lack of association with prematurity remained unchanged. In conclusion, prevalence
  of daily maté drinking was high among pregnant women and, contrary to the hypothesis,
  no harmful effect on intrauterine growth or duration of pregnancy was detected. '
