  It is known that cadmium is able to regulate gene expression, drastically affecting
  the pattern of transcriptional activity and intracellular signalization in normal
  and pathological human cells. We have already shown that Cd exerts a cytotoxic effect
  on neoplastic MDA-MB231 cells from the human breast, which is characterized by the
  onset of a "non-classical" apoptotic kind of death, impairment of mitochondrial
  activity and drastic changes in gene expression pattern. In the present study, employing
  a combination of conventional and differential display-PCR techniques, immunocytochemical,
  ELISA and Western analyses, we extended the knowledge on the transcriptional modulation
  exerted by the metal demonstrating that in MDA-MB231 cells 5 Î¼M CdCl2 treatment
  for 96 h selectively down-regulates astrocyte-elevated gene-1 and reduces the accumulation
  of its protein product which appears to be associated with the internal cytomembranes
  and also present in the nucleoplasm. In addition, due to the acknowledged role of
  AEG-1 in the intranuclear shuttling of NF-ÎºB p65 subunit, we also showed that CdCl2
  treatment determines the decrease of p65 amount in nuclear extracts and the down-regulation
  of the NF-ÎºB downstream genes c-fos and c-jun, thus providing a new contribution
  to the comprehension of the intracellular molecular mechanisms implicated in Cd-breast
  cancer cell interactions.'
