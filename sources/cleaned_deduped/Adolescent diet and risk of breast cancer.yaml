  etiology of breast cancer. \n\n\n\nA nested case-control study was conducted among
  participants in the Nurses Health Study who completed a 24-item questionnaire about
  diet during high school. There were 843 eligible cases diagnosed between onset of
  study and before the return of the high school diet questionnaire, who were matched
  10:1 with controls on the basis of age. \n\n\n\nWomen who had, during adolescence,
  a higher consumption of eggs, vegetable fat and fiber had a lower risk of breast
  cancer, whereas risk of breast cancer was increased among women who consumed more
  butter. \n\n\n\nA possible association of elements of adolescent diet with risk
  of breast cancer is reported, but the findings require confirmation in prospective
  study. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe evidence that adolescent diet may affect the risk of breast
  cancer derives from several lines of evidence . Rates of breast cancer among Asian
  immigrants to the United States do not approach those of US white women until the
  second or third generation, suggesting that exposures during childhood and adolescence
  are important in establishing a higher risk of breast cancer . Norwegian women who
  were adolescents during World War II, when average caloric intake decreased by 22%,
  have a reduced incidence of breast cancer, suggesting that energy restriction might
  affect risk . Similarly, in animal models, energy restriction in the peripubertal
  period inhibits mammary tissue proliferation and reduces the subsequent risk of
  mammary tumors . Exposure of rats to carcinogens before first pregnancy increases
  the incidence of mammary tumors compared with exposure after first pregnancy . After
  differentiation of the mammary gland at the time of first full-term pregnancy of
  the rat, the rate of cell division decreases and length of the cell cycle increases,
  allowing more time for DNA repair . This biologic phenomenon might explain the apparent
  vulnerability of the adolescent breast tissue to carcinogenic exposures. Among atomic
  bomb survivors and women exposed to ionizing radiation as part of their treatment
  for Hodgkins disease, the risk of breast cancer increases with younger age at exposure
  . \n\nAlthough this analysis was principally an exploratory analysis to guide prospective
  studies, the authors had previously proposed that certain elements of adolescent
  diet might be protective against future risk of breast cancer . For instance, we
  and others have proposed that fiber might be protective by lowering endogenous estrogen
  levels and that folate might be protective owing to its role in DNA methylation.
  \n\n\n\n\n\nThis study was conducted among the participants of the Nurses Health
  Study, a prospective cohort of 121,700 women who have completed biennial questionnaires
  on medical events and lifestyle factors since the initiation of the study in 1976,
  when the women were 30–55 years of age . The study has been approved by the institutional
  review board at the Brigham and Womens Hospital, Boston. \n\n\n\nIn 1986, when participants
  were 40–65 years of age, they completed a 24-item food-frequency questionnaire about
  diet between the ages of 12 and 18 years. The FFQ was designed to include foods
  that account for major sources of fat, antioxidant vitamins, and carotenoids. For
  each food item on the FFQ, a unit or portion size was specified. Subjects were asked
  how often, on average, they had consumed the specified amount of each item. Nine
  possible responses were provided ranging from never to six or more per day. \n\nNutrient
  intakes were computed for each subject by assigning a weight proportional to the
  frequency of use of each food, multiplying this weighting by the nutrient value
  for the specified portion size, and summing the contributions of all foods. The
  nutrient database used in this study was derived from the US Department of Agricultures
  handbook  with additional information from McCance and Widdowson  and also from
  data obtained from food manufacturers. The database incorporates research on the
  historical trends in the enrichment of the food supply, such as the addition of
  vitamin D to milk and vitamin A to margarine. For vitamin A, women born before 1942
  were assigned unenriched values; women born after 1942 were assigned enriched values.
  The questionnaire has been shown to be highly reproducible and not significantly
  correlated with current diet as an adult . \n\nParticipants who had completed the
  high school diet assessment section of the 1986 follow-up questionnaire and who
  also had reported current diet in 1980 were eligible for the study. Incident cases
  of breast cancer, confirmed by medical record review, diagnosed after the report
  of current diet in 1980 and before the return of the 1986 questionnaire on which
  high school diet was reported, were eligible for inclusion in the study. The analysis
  included both in situ and invasive cases of breast cancer. One hundred and thirty-six
  cases died before the mailing of the 1986 questionnaire, 69 cases did not return
  the 1986 questionnaire, and 175 cases did not fill out the high school diet section
  of the 1986 questionnaire. Cases were excluded from the analysis if the total calories
  reported on high school diet were implausible, i.e. less than 500 or greater than
  4500, if the reported age at menarche was greater than 21 years, or if they had
  previously been diagnosed with cancer other than breast cancer. The final case pool
  included 64% of the cases diagnosed between 1980 and 1986. Included cases had a
  later age at menarche, were more likely to be premenopausal, and were more likely
  to report a family history of breast cancer than cases excluded from the analysis.
  Controls were matched to cases by month and year of birth in a 10:1 ratio. The exclusion
  criteria for controls were the same as for cases. \n\n\n\nControls were assigned
  the date of diagnosis of their matched case. The risk factor status of both cases
  and controls was updated from the questionnaire most recently completed before date
  of diagnosis. Risk factors that were updated included menopausal status, family
  history, diagnosis of benign breast disease, and postmenopausal hormone use. All
  tests of significance were two-sided. Differences in risk factor status between
  cases and controls were tested with χ2 or t-tests. \n\nFoods were analyzed as continuous
  variables based on the number of servings per day. Nutrients were analyzed using
  quintiles of nutrient intake, according to the distribution in the control population.
  Multiple logistic regression was used to estimate relative risks as odds ratios
  while controlling simultaneously for potentially confounding variables. Trends across
  quintiles were tested with the use of the logistic model. Relative risks were estimated
  as odds ratios while controlling simultaneously for potentially confounding variables.
  Trends across quintiles were tested with the use of the logistic model. Relative
  risks were calculated by comparing the highest and lowest quintiles of nutrient
  intake. Multivariate models included age at diagnosis, family history of breast
  cancer in mother or sister, diagnosis of benign breast disease, age at menarche,
  body mass index at age 18, adult height, reproductive history, and vitamin A intake
  in 1980 . Current vitamin A intake was included in the model because we have previously
  shown in this cohort of women that lower intake of vitamin A is positively associated
  with an increased risk of breast cancer. Reproductive history was represented by
  dummy variables, indicating whether the subject had children, and, if so, the number
  of children and the age at which the first child was born. \n\n\n\nBreast cancer
  cases had later age at first birth, lower parity, increased adult height, and higher
  incidence of BBD, and were more likely than controls to have a family history of
  breast cancer. Cases also reported lower vitamin A intake and higher alcohol intake
  in 1980 than did controls. \n\nIncreased consumption of eggs was associated with
  decreased risk of breast cancer. Consumption of butter was positively associated
  with increased risk of breast cancer. RR values for individual foods were generally
  similar for premenopausal and postmenopausal women. Foods were grouped according
  to type, but none of the groupings was significantly related to risk of breast cancer.
  \n\nTable 1. Relative risk of breast cancer for foods consumed during adolescence
  among women born between 1922 and 1946 \n\nNutrient analysis, controlling for other
  established risk factors, showed that greater consumption of vegetable fat and dietary
  fiber were related to a reduced risk of breast cancer. No other associations between
  nutrient intake and risk of breast cancer were observed. Inclusion versus exclusion
  of adult height, which might be on the causal pathway between adolescent diet and
  adult health, did not substantially alter the results reported. \n\nTable 2. Relative
  risk of breast cancer according to quintiles of nutrient intake during high school
  among women born between 1922 and 1946 \n\n\n\nIn this nested case-control study,
  the relation of adolescent diet to risk of breast cancer was evaluated among participants
  in the Nurses Health Study who had completed a 24-item FFQ about diet during high
  school. Increased consumption of eggs was inversely associated with risk of breast
  cancer. Eggs are rich sources of essential amino acids, minerals and vitamins. For
  instance, one egg contains 11.5% of the recommended daily allowance for folate and
  6.5% of that for vitamin D . Conversely, increased consumption of butter was associated
  with a slight increase in risk. Neither animal fat, total fat, nor unsaturated fat
  was associated with increased risk on nutrient analysis; however, another nutrient
  in butter might confer increased risk, or the consumption of butter might be a proxy
  for another risk factor. \n\nWhen specific nutrients were examined, increased consumption
  of both vegetable fat and dietary fiber was associated with a decreased risk of
  breast cancer. Fiber might affect the risk of breast cancer by decreasing estrogen
  levels; fiber binds estrogen excreted into the gastrointestinal tract and reduces
  enterohepatic circulation . In addition, higher dietary fiber intake has been associated
  with higher plasma levels of sex-hormone-binding globulin, which can reduce the
  bioavailability of estrogens . The potential mechanism of a protective effect of
  vegetable fat is more speculative: vegetable fat is a composite of multiple forms
  of fatty acids, some of which have been proposed to increase risk whereas other
  specific fatty acids have been proposed to decrease risk . More detail on the type
  and composition of the vegetable oil used is necessary to pursue this relation with
  greater precision. \n\nSeveral limitations to the study exist. First, the validity
  of diet data recalled from 22 to 47 years in the past is unknown. Although we have
  shown that this recall is reproducible and is not highly correlated with current
  diet , we can only infer validity. Potischman et al.  have shown that there is a
  strong degree of concordance between the report of mother and the report of daughter
  about foods consumed during this age period, although others have shown that recall
  of diet from the distant past is imprecise . However, in the absence of dietary
  data actually collected during adolescence, recall of high school diet provides
  the best estimate of possible relationships between diet during adolescence and
  the risk of breast cancer. \n\nSecond, the 24-item FFQ is too short for complete
  assessment of total energy intake or specific nutrients. For instance, the intake
  of folate calculated from high school FFQ is much lower than the range seen in adult
  women ; median intake group in the top quintile of intake during high school was
  only 238 μg per day. Given the restricted list of foods from which the nutrients
  were derived, more emphasis should be placed on the analysis of foods than of nutrients
  when interpreting these data. \n\nA third limitation of the current study is the
  possibility of recall bias because high school diet history was obtained after diagnosis
  of breast cancer. The most prevalent, although apparently incorrect, dietary hypothesis
  among the general population in 1986 was the notion that increased fat consumption
  significantly increased risk. Nevertheless, in this study the lack of association
  of fat intake suggests that recall bias was probably not a major factor. However,
  the brevity of this questionnaire might not have permitted complete recording of
  all sources of fat. \n\nA further limitation is the possibility of survivor bias.
  Only cases alive in 1986 who had completed the high school diet portion of the questionnaire
  were included in the analysis. If adolescent diet in any way increases the risk
  of mortality from breast cancer, women with these adverse dietary patterns would
  not be included in analysis, and the relation would be distorted. Finally, there
  remains the possibility of residual confounding by unmeasured factors, for instance
  socioeconomic status during childhood and its impact on dietary composition. \n\nFour
  other studies of the relation between childhood diet and breast cancer have been
  reported previously. Pryor et al.  conducted a case–control study of adolescent
  diet and breast cancer in Utah. Recall of diet was assessed by a modification of
  the Block questionnaire, selecting for foods higher in fat and fiber. No data were
  presented on the foods themselves; only possible relations between fat and fiber,
  stratified by menopausal status, were reported. Higher intake of fat from dairy
  sources was associated with a decreased risk of breast cancer for both premenopausal
  and postmenopausal women. This conclusion contrasts with the finding of our study
  in which a higher intake of butter was associated with a small increase in risk.
  A higher intake of fiber decreased risk in premenopausal women, whereas a higher
  intake of fiber was associated with an increased risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal
  women, analogous to a finding of the present study. \n\nHislop et al.  conducted
  a case-control study in British Columbia among 846 incident cases of breast cancer
  between 1980 and 1982. Women were asked to recall their dietary intake of 31 foods
  during early childhood. In premenopausal women, consumption of meat with visible
  fat during childhood was associated with an increased risk of breast cancer Consumption
  of vegetable oils was associated with a reduced risk in premenopausal women. We
  also observed an inverse relationship between the intake of vegetable fat and the
  risk of breast cancer. \n\nPotischman et al.  conducted a case-control study among
  1647 cases who had been diagnosed with breast cancer at less than 45 years of age.
  Participants were asked during a telephone interview to quantify their intake of
  29 foods at ages 12–13 years. The mothers of the participants were also asked to
  recall their daughters intake of foods at ages 12–13 years. The response of each
  mother was highly correlated with the daughters report. The authors reported that
  increased consumption of high-fat meats was associated with an increased risk of
  breast cancer, whereas increased consumption of fruits and vegetables was associated
  with a non-significant but consistent decrease in risk of breast cancer. \n\n\n\nThe
  present study revealed that increased consumption of eggs was associated with a
  decreased risk of breast cancer, whereas increased consumption of butter was associated
  with a slight increase in risk. In addition, increased intake of vegetable oils
  and dietary fiber seemed to be inversely related to risk of breast cancer. Future
  studies of the relation between adolescent diet and risk of breast cancer are warranted
  and should include a more complete assessment of diet. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBBD = benign
