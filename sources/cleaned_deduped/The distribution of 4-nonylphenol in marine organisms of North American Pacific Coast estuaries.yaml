  One of the chemical breakdown products of nonylphenol ethoxylates, 4-nonylphenol,
  accumulates in organisms and is of concern as an environmental pollutant due to
  its endocrine disrupting effects. We measured 4-NP levels in the seawater, sediment,
  and twelve organisms within the California estuary, Morro Bay, and examined biomagnification
  of 4-NP using stable isotope abundances  to quantify trophic position. 4-NP concentrations
  in organisms from Morro Bay included 25000  8600 ng g1 lw in liver of California
  sea lion, 14000  5600 ng g1 lw in liver of harbor porpoise, 138000  55000 ng g1
  lw in liver of sea otters, 15700  3600 ng g1 lw in liver of seabirds, 36100  6100
  ng g1 lw in arrow goby fish, 62800  28400 ng g1 lw in oysters, and 12700  1300 ng
  g1 lw in mussels. 4-NP levels generally showed a pattern of trophic dilution among
  organisms in Morro Bay, with exceptions of biomagnification observed between three
  trophic links: mussel to sea otter, oyster to sea otter, and arrow goby to staghorn
  sculpin. Our examination of other west coast estuaries of USA and Canada revealed
  that mean 4-NP concentrations in gobies and mussels from Morro Bay were significantly
  higher than those from a more urbanized estuary, San Francisco Bay  and from a remote
  estuary, Bamfield Inlet, Canada. Relative to other estuaries worldwide, 4-NP levels
  in seawater  and sediment  of Morro Bay are low, but gobies and oysters have higher
  4-NP levels than comparable fauna.'
