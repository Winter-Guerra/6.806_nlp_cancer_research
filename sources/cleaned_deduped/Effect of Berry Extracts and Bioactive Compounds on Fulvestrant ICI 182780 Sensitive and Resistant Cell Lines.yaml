  cancer that is unresponsive to other endocrine therapies. Berries are frequently
  consumed for their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer potential. In
  this study, we tested the efficacy of two berry extracts and their bioactive compounds
  to inhibit cell proliferation with or without a sublethal dose of ICI in various
  breast cancer cell lines. ICI-sensitive and -resistant cells were subjected to treatment
  with berry extracts alone or with a sub-lethal dose of ICI. Extracts and Del enhanced
  the effect of ICI in sensitive ZR75-1 and BT474 cells primarily in an additive fashion~1).
  In ZR75-1R cells, both EJAE and RRE synergistically enhanced the effects of ICI.
  EA, in doses tested, did not have any significant effects on any of the cell lines.
  Finally, we found that the extracts were more effective at lower, physiologically
  relevant concentrations than at higher experimental doses.\n\n\n\nIt is estimated
  that 28% of new cancer cases are breast cancer incidences . Of these newly diagnosed
  breast tumors, 65-70% will express the estrogen receptor alpha . Estrogen activation
  of the ER is required in the development of a healthy mammary gland. However, it
  also can be involved in the development of both primary and secondary breast cancers
  due to altered ER signaling . Activation of ER by estrogen promotes cell growth
  and survival of tumor cells . Primary ERα-positive breast cancer can be effectively
  treated with antiestrogens. AE drugs can be used in the metastatic, adjuvant, and
  chemopreventive settings and responses are typically seen in about 70% of ER+ patients
  selected for such treatment . Currently, Tamoxifen is the most widely used AE for
  ER+ breast cancer. TAM is an example of a selective estrogen receptor modulator
  which acts as an antagonist to ERα in the breast, leading to a reduction in the
  proliferation of tumor cells . However approximately 1/3 of tumors treated with
  TAM either possess de novo or acquire resistance to TAM, leading to breast cancer
  recurrence . Further, TAM acts as an ER agonist in the endometrium and in certain
  cases in the breast epithelium .\n\nFulvestrant is a steroidal AE designed to have
  no agonist activity with the ER . ICI acts by degrading, and downregulating the
  ERα in the tumor cells . Currently, ICI is used for the treatment of advanced breast
  cancer that is resistant to other endocrine therapies. It is effective in tumors
  and cell lines that are resistant to TAM yet still express ER . However, in the
  clinic the duration of response and time to progression on ICI is only 19 and 5.5
  months, respectively . Finding strategies to increase the sensitivity of the breast
  cancer cells to ICI may result in increased efficacy of drug therapy. \n\nThere
  is evidence to show that healthy changes in diet can prevent up to 40% of breast
  cancers . Further, data is beginning to show that an increased intake of fruits
  and vegetables in patients recently diagnosed with breast cancer may reduce the
  risk of recurrent breast cancer . This preventive effect can largely be attributed
  to the various phytochemicals present in fruits and vegetables. These bioactive
  compounds have been shown to affect the development of both primary and secondary
  breast cancer by affecting cell proliferation, survival, and death .\n\nRed raspberry
  is a readily available fruit that is part of our diets and is a rich source of phytochemicals.
  It is composed of compounds that inhibit the proliferation of many types of cancer
  cells, including breast cancer . RRB contains high levels of anthocyanins such as
  cyanidin-3-sophoroside, cyanidin-3-glucoside, pelargonidin-3-glucoside, and ellagic
  acid . In vivo studies in mice show that red raspberry diet increases DNA repair
  enzymes and reduces oxidative DNA damage. Ellagic acid, a phenolic component in
  RRB, also shows similar effects . Further, the polyphenols present in RRB can inhibit
  nuclear receptors, growth factors, and kinase signaling leading to cell-cycle arrest,
  apoptosis, or autophagy-associated cell death . The red raspberry extract used in
  the study has been previously standardized and inhibits the growth of several cancer
  cell lines, including breast cancer, in a dose-dependent manner .\n\nThe Java Plum,
  also called the Jamun fruit, is the fruit of Eugenia jambolana Lam., a tree that
  can be found in Florida and Hawaii in the United States and other various tropical
  zones in the world. The Jamun fruit extract used in this study has been previously
  standardized . EJAE is rich in anthocyanidins including petunidin, malvidin, delphinidin,
  cyanidin, and peonidin . EJAE reduces the proliferation of MCF7-aro and MDA-MB-231
  breast cancer cell lines . Neither EJAE nor RRE has been previously tested in ER+,
  ICI-resistant cell lines. \n\nClarke and coworkers have developed a series of cell
  lines as an in vitro model of AE resistance . These cell lines have been used extensively
  to study the mechanisms of AE resistance. The LCC series were initially derived
  from MCF7 cells and consists of LCC1 and LCC9 . More recently we have derived another
  ICI-resistant variant of the ZR75-1 cells, that was developed by culturing ZR75-1
  in sequentially increasing concentrations of ICI for more than one year. These cell
  lines serve as in vitro models that represent some phenotypes of ICI-resistant breast
  cancer.\n\nIn this study, we tested the effects of Jamun and red raspberry extracts
  and the individual phenolics ellagic acid and delphinidin on ICI-sensitive and resistant
  cells. We hypothesized that in sensitive cells, berry extracts and their compounds
  would have a synergistic effect with ICI, increasing the inhibition of cell proliferation
  by a sublethal dose of ICI, and in resistant cells, the extracts would resensitize
  the cells to ICI making them more susceptible to ICI-induced growth inhibition.
  Cell proliferation was measured in the presence of extracts/compounds with or without
  ICI. In addition, molecular markers of apoptosis, autophagy, and ER signaling were
  also analyzed to understand the mechanism by which EJAE, RRE, and their compounds
  reduced the growth of these cells. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe LCC1 and LCC9 cells were cultured
  in modified IMEM containing 5% charcoal-stripped calf serum The ZR75-1, ZR75-1R,
  and BT474 cells were cultured in modified IMEM containing 5% fetal bovine serum
  Establishment of LCC1 cells has been previously described . LCC9 and ZR75-1R cells
  were derived by the long-term selection of LCC1 and ZR75-1 cells, respectively,
  in sequentially increasing concentrations of ICI as described . All cells were grown
  in a humidified incubator at 37°C with 5% CO2. Cells were then harvested at 70%
  confluence for use in cell proliferation and biomarker analysis. All cell lines
  tested negative for Mycoplasma sp. contamination. \n\n\n\nBerry extracts were obtained
  from Dr. Navindra P. Seeram and have been previously described . Briefly, EJAE was
  obtained by sequential extraction of freeze-dried Jamun fruit in cold hexanes, ethyl
  acetate, and acidified methanol . It contains 3.6% anthocyanins measured as cyanidin-3-glucoside
  equivalents. EJAE is the same acidified methanol extract referred to as the Jamun
  fruit extract, in a previous publication . RRE was extracted from red raspberry
  using acidified methanol as described . Ellagic acid was purchased from Sigma Chemicals
  and delphinidin from Chromadex Inc.\n\n\n\nCells were plated in 48-well plates and
  incubated overnight for attachment. RRE, EJAE, EA, and Del were dissolved in DMSO
  and ICI was dissolved in ethanol. DMSO and ethanol were used as appropriate vehicle
  controls either alone or in combination. All cells were treated with 1-100 μg/mL
  RRE, 0.1-100 μg/mL EJAE, or 0.1-10 μM EA or Del with or without ICI. For sensitive
  cell lines, cells were treated with 1 nm ICI, which is a sublethal dose and well
  below the IC50 of ICI for LCC1. For resistant cell lines, ICI was used at a concentration
  of 1 nM and 1 μM. All groups were treated after 24 h for the first time and the
  treatment was repeated at 72 h for all 6 d time points. Cells were stained with
  0.5% crystal violet in 25% methanol, dried, and the stain dissolved in 100 mM sodium
  citrate in 50% ethanol. Absorbance was measured at 550 nm.\n\n\n\nCells were plated
  in 6-well plates and incubated overnight for attachment. One concentration of each
  phytochemical was used for biomarker analysis. The concentration of phytochemical
  with the most significant reduction in cell proliferation for that respective cell
  line was used for treatment of cells for molecular marker analysis. Same vehicle
  control as described above was used. After 3 d, cells were suspended in radioimmunoprecipitation
  assay buffer; 1 mM sodium orthovanadate; 1X Roche complete miniprotease inhibitor
  cocktail). Twenty-forty μg of protein was fractionated using an SDS-PAGE gel, transferred
  to a nitrocellulose membrane, and blocked with 5% Milk in TBS-T. These membranes
  were incubated with primary followed by an appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary
  antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Reactive products were visualized by chemiluminescence
  and quantified by densitometry using the Quantity One software. Membranes were stripped
  and reprobed for β-actin as the loading control. Treatment was replicated independently
  three times for statistical analysis.\n\n\n\nThe data is represented as mean  standard
  error. Cell proliferation data is derived from three to four independent experiments
  performed in triplicate for each cell line. All treatments were normalized to the
  vehicle control and fold change was calculated. A  -test was used to calculate the
  differences in mean using Microsoft Excel and a  value ≤ 0.05 was considered significant.
  The relative index was also calculated using the formula RI =/ = , where  and  are
  extracts/compounds and ICI, respectively . An RI = 1 is considered additive, ;1
  antagonism or absence of synergism, and &gt;1 presence of synergism. \n\n\n\n\n\nIn
  this study we have used three models of endocrine resistance to test the effect
  of berry extracts and compounds. The LCC1 cells, originally derived from MCF7 cells,
  are ER+, E independent, and sensitive to both TAM and ICI. This can also be considered
  as a model of aromatase inhibitor resistance . LCC9 cells were derived by further
  culturing LCC1 in sequentially increasing doses of ICI . These cells are ER+, E
  independent and are TAM and ICI cross-resistant. Previous studies have shown the
  effect of both RRE and Del in MCF7 cells . We also used ZR75-1 cells, initially
  derived from a tumor that was unresponsive to TAM . These cells are ER+, PGR+, TAM,
  and ICI sensitive and express a low level of p53 . ZR75-1R cells were derived from
  ZR75-1 cells by a similar procedure as for LCC9 cells. They also are cross-resistant
  to TAM and ICI. The BT-474 cells belong to the Luminal B molecular classification
  along with the ZR75-1 cells . These cells are ER+, PGR+ and overexpress Her 2 .
  To our knowledge, this is the first study to assess the effects of berry extracts
  in LCC1, LCC9, ZR75-1, ZR75-1R, and BT-474 cells. This is also the first study to
  evaluate the effect of berry extracts and phytochemicals on ICI-resistant cell lines.
  \n\nAll ICI-sensitive cells were slightly growth inhibited by 1 nM ICI. This effect
  was most prominent after 6 d. In LCC1 cells, 6 d ICI treatment resulted in a 30%
  decrease in cell proliferation compared to vehicle treatment. In ZR75-1 cells, 1
  nM ICI did not cause a significant reduction in cell proliferation at 3 d, but caused
  a 20% reduction at 6 d. In BT474 cells, ICI treatment alone caused a 13% and 25%
  reduction in cell proliferation after 3 and 6 d, respectively. Since the growth
  inhibitory effect was less than 50%, we considered 1 nM ICI to be sublethal dose
  in sensitive cells. On the other hand, resistant cells were not growth inhibited
  by ICI concentrations of up to 1 μM. Thus, we tested the effects of extracts and
  compounds to resensitize LCC9 and ZR75-1R at two different concentrations of ICI.\n\n\n\n\n\nLCC1
  cells are ER+ and respond to estrogenic stimuli with increased growth. We found
  that all berry extracts and compounds had an estrogenic effect on LCC1 cells indicated
  by the moderate to significant, dose-dependent, increase in cell proliferation after
  6 d treatment-1(d)). Further, this effect was found to be ER-mediated since cotreatment
  of LCC1 cells with ICI abrogated the effects of extracts/compounds-1(d)). These
  effects were more prominent after 6 d rather than a 3 d treatment. Of note, Del
  has a significant proliferative effect on LCC1 at 0.1 μM, 1 μM, and 10 μM with a
  fold change of 1.26, 1.33, and 2.04, respectively). After 6 d treatment, concentrations
  of 0.1 μM and 1 μM of EA showed a nonsignificant proliferative effect, but 10 μM
  of EA showed no change in cell proliferation). This shows that there is a specific
  range of concentrations at which EA may have estrogenic properties.\n\nFigure 1:
  Effect of berry extracts and polyphenols on proliferation of ICI-sensitive cell
  lines. Cell proliferation results from 6 d treatment of various cell lines with
  respective berry extract or polyphenol. Yellow bars represent extract/polyphenol
  only and blue bars represent extract/polyphenol + 1 nM ICI. Each extract or polyphenol
  used for treatment was diluted 1000-fold from stock concentration. Vehicle treatment
  contained 0.01% EtOH and 0.1% DMSO. All treatments were normalized to the appropriate
  vehicle treatment. Data represented is mean  standard error of three individual
  experiments performed in triplicate for each treatment. The means were tested for
  difference using a  -test and a  considered significant. The significantly different
  means compared to vehicle control or ICI-only treatment are indicated.\n\n\n\nWhile
  berry extracts and compounds had significant growth promoting effects on E-independent
  LCC1 cells, they showed a dose-dependent but moderate growth inhibitory effects
  of ZR75-1 and BT474 cells grown in E-sufficient medium-1(l)). EJAE alone, dose dependently
  inhibited the proliferation of ZR75-1 cells after 6 d treatment). This effect was
  enhanced by cotreatment with ICI but significant only at 100 μg/mL of EJAE. In BT474
  cells, a variable response was observed with EJAE treatment alone). There were no
  synergistic or additive effects seen after addition of 1 nM ICI). However, it must
  be noted that the lower dose had a greater effect when combined with ICI suggesting
  that doses in physiologically achievable ranges may achieve an additive effect with
  drug therapy.\n\nA lower dose of RRE was more effective than the higher dose in
  ZR75-1 cells after 3 d. However, at 6 d, only the 100 μg/mL RRE showed a 20% reduction
  in cell proliferation). This effect was slightly modified to 26% by the addition
  of 1 nM ICI. In BT474 cells, both 1 and 100 μg/mL RRE showed ≥ 15% reduction in
  cell proliferation without ICI after 3 d treatment. However, after 6 d, RRE alone
  showed a dose-dependent 15-28% reduction). The addition of ICI slightly enhanced
  this effect). However, an RI of 0.86 in ZR75-1 and of 0.89 in BT474 suggests that
  at higher doses RRE and ICI may trend toward antagonizing the action of each other.\n\nIn
  ZR75-1 cells, we observed only 28% and 20% antiproliferative effect at the highest
  dose of Del at 3 and 6 d, respectively). However, a linear dose response and a synergistic
  effect were observed when ICI was added). In BT474 cells, after 3 d, the lowest
  dose of Del was the most effective in curbing proliferation. An additive effect
  was also evident with 1 nM ICI. After 6 d, all doses of Del achieved  % reduction
  in the presence of ICI showing an RI. = 1.0, suggesting that the effects were additive).
  EA treatment did not significantly alter the proliferation of either cell line at
  doses tested with or without ICI after 6 d treatment and 1(m)).\n\n\n\n\n\nIn LCC9
  cells, EJAE alone caused a modest, but significant, reduction in cell proliferation
  after 3 d. However this effect was not present at 6 d). EJAE did not significantly
  resensitize LCC9 cells to either 1 nM) or 1 μM ICI at any concentration tested.
  At 6 d, RRE increased the inhibitory response of LCC9 cells to 1 nM ICI). However,
  we did not observe this synergistic effect at 1 μM ICI, suggesting that specific
  cellular responses are elicited at specific doses of the drug and the extract. Del
  alone had no effect on cell proliferation at 3 or 6 d. In the presence of 1 nM ICI
  and 0.1 μM Del, there was a 35% induction of cell proliferation at 3 d. However,
  this effect was not seen at 6 d). RRE alone caused a 28% and 18% nonsignificant
  reduction at 3 and 6 d, respectively. This effect was not altered by ICI after 3
  d or 6 d. EA neither had a significant growth inhibiting effect on LCC9 cells after
  3 d or 6 d treatment, nor showed an ability to resensitize LCC9 cells to 1 nM ICI).\n\nFigure
  2: Effect of berry extracts and polyphenols on proliferation of ICI-resistant cell
  lines. Cell proliferation results from 6 d treatment of various cell lines with
  respective berry extract or polyphenol. Yellow bars represent extract/polyphenol
  only and blue bars represent extract/polyphenol + 1 nM ICI. Each extract or polyphenol
  used for treatment was diluted 1000-fold from stock concentration. Vehicle treatment
  contained 0.01% EtOH and 0.1% DMSO. All treatments were normalized to the appropriate
  vehicle treatment. Data represented is mean  standard error of three individual
  experiments performed in triplicate for each treatment. The means were tested for
  difference using a  -test and a  considered significant. \n\n\n\nZR75-1R cells were
  overall more susceptible to the effects of both EJAE and RRE than LCC9 cells. After
  3 d, EJAE alone at 100 μg/mL and 0.01 μg/mL showed a reduction in cell proliferation
  by 20% and 35%, respectively. This suggests a biphasic response with highest and
  lowest dose eliciting similar effects. However, after 6 d treatment, the reduction
  was sustained only at the highest dose). In the presence of 1 nM ICI, EJAE showed
  a reduction in cell proliferation. This effect is slightly greater than that seen
  for EJAE alone). However, in the presence of 1 μM ICI, we observed a linear dose
  response with 1, 10, and 100 μg/mL of EJAE reducing cell proliferation by 15%, 15%,
  and 40%, respectively). \n\nFigure 3: Effect of berry extracts proliferation on
  ICI-resistant cell line without and with ICI. Cell proliferation results from 6
  d treatment of RRE on ZR75-1R. Vehicle treatment contained 0.01% EtOH and 0.1% DMSO.
  All treatments were normalized to the appropriate vehicle treatment. Data represented
  is mean  standard error of three individual experiments performed in triplicate
  for each treatment. The means were tested for difference using a  -test and a  considered
  significant. The significantly different means compared to vehicle control or ICI-only
  treatment are indicated. The relative index was calculated using the formula RI
  =/ = , where  and  , are extract and ICI, respectively . An RI = 1 was considered
  additive, &lt;1 antagonism or absence of synergism, and &gt;1 presence of synergism.\n\nAn
  interesting RRE dose response with an inverted-U curve was observed in ZR75-1R cells.
  At 6 d, lower doses showed a proliferative effect, whereas higher dose showed a
  22% reduction in cell proliferation). Addition of 1 nm ICI does not change this
  effect). However, in the presence of 1 μM ICI, RRE significantly and dose-dependently
  inhibited ZR75-1R growth by 25-50%). Both 1 μg/mL and 10 μg/mL RRE had a highly
  synergistic effect in the presence of 1 μM ICI with RI values of 1.98 and 1.71,
  respectively). \n\nDel treatment of ZR75-1R did not show any significant change
  in cell proliferation after 3 or 6 d treatment with or without 1 nM ICI). EA treatment
  of ZR75-1R did not show a change in cell proliferation). However, EA treatment with
  1 nM ICI showed a synergistic dose response after 3 d as 1 μM and 10 μM displayed
  a 15% and 20% reduction in cell proliferation, respectively. This shows that EA
  could resensitize the cells to ICI at 3 d. However, this response was not seen after
  6 d EA treatment). \n\n\n\nIn order to understand the molecular mechanisms by which
  berry extracts and its constituents cause the observed effects in LCC1 and LCC9
  cells, we assessed the levels of various molecular markers in these cells after
  treatment with berry extract/compound alone or in the presence of ICI. Since the
  antiproliferative effects of the compounds were evident at 3 d, we chose this time
  point to study molecular mechanisms. Also, we specifically chose those concentrations
  of extracts/compounds that produced the greatest reduction in cell proliferation
  at 6 d-1(h)). As expected in LCC1 cells, EJAE and Del alone showed an estrogenic
  response with an observed increase of 3- and 2.5-fold, respectively, in progesterone
  receptor expression). RRE and EA also increase PGR expression by greater than 2-fold.
  This increase was completely reversed by cotreatment with ICI). Interestingly, EA
  and Del alone also raised ERα levels). We also assessed molecular markers of cell
  death, autophagy), and the levels of the antiapoptotic B-cell lymphoma family members.
  It has been previously shown that combined knockdown of BCL2 and BCLw leads to resensitization
  of LCC9 cells to TAM and ICI . BCL2 also interacts with Beclin 1 to inhibit autophagy
  . \n\nFigure 4: Effect of berry extracts and polyphenols on the expression of nuclear
  receptors and cell-death markers in ICI-sensitive Cell Lines. Biomarker analysis
  results from 3 d treatment of berry extracts and polyphenols. Data represented as
  fold change over the vehicle. Extract only treatment was normalized to nontreated
  cells. Extract +ICI was normalized to the appropriate vehicle treatment. Vehicle
  treatment contained 0.01% EtOH and 0.1% DMSO. Concentrations of treatments were
  as follows: ICI = 1 nM; EJAE = 0.1 μg/mL; RRE = 1 μg/mL; EA = 1 μM; DEL = 1 μM.
  Concentration of extract used showed the most significant reduction in cell proliferation
  of LCC1 cells after 6 d treatment. Each extract or polyphenol used for treatment
  was diluted 1000-fold from stock concentration. designates a significance of  compared
  to vehicle control. \n\nAlthough we observed a clear increase in PARP expression
  by EA alone and a reduction in levels after ICI treatment across all extracts, we
  did not see cleavage of PARP in any of the treatments). EJAE, RRE, and Del caused
  a 2-fold induction in LC3II levels, which was reversed by the addition of ICI, except
  for EJAE). EJAE + ICI caused a 3.3-fold induction of LC3II in LCC1 cells). On the
  other hand, EJAE, Del, and EA increased the levels of p62 to various extents). As
  expected, ICI treatment reduced p62 levels by 60%, suggesting active autophagy.
  EJAE did not alter this response; however, RRE, EA, and DEL all reversed this reduction.
  RRE and EA treatments significantly increased the levels on Beclin-1). EJAE induced
  Beclin-1 levels by 5-fold in the presence of ICI). The effect of extracts/compounds
  on the BCL2-family members was neither uniform nor significant-4(j)). EA increased
  the expression of BCL-2 &gt; 1.5-fold without or with ICI). BCLw and BCLxL expression
  was induced by EA and Del alone and EJAE + ICI and 4(j)). \n\nIn LCC9 cells, EJAE
  induced PGR levels without altering ERα levels). EJAE also induced Beclin-1 levels,
  both in the presence and absence of ICI. EJAE + ICI treatment increased LC3II levels
  by 13.7-fold over vehicle or ICI-only treatment, suggesting that EJAE may increase
  autophagosome formation in LCC9 cells. However, we failed to see a baseline increase
  in LC3II with ICI-only treatment. We did not observe PARP cleavage or a significant
  change in BCL2 levels. On the other hand, RRE + ICI, Del alone, and Del + ICI showed
  an across-the-board increase in the expression of all BCL2-family proteins, as well
  as Beclin-1. RRE + ICI treatment and Del increased p62 expression 2-2.5 fold suggesting
  an inhibition of autophagy.\n\nFigure 5: and Effect of EJAE and RRE on the expression

  represented as fold change over the vehicle. All treatments were normalized to vehicle
  treatment. Vehicle treatment contained 0.01% EtOH and 0.1% DMSO. Concentrations
  of treatments were as follows: TAM = 100 nM; ICI = 1 nM; EJAE = 100 μg/mL; RRE =
  10 μg/mL; and DEL = 1 μM. Concentration of extract used showed the most significant
  reduction in cell proliferation of LCC9 cells after 6 d treatment. Each extract
  or polyphenol used for treatment was diluted 1000-fold from stock concentration.
  designates a significance of  compared to vehicle control. \n\n\n\nIn this study,
  we tested whether berry extracts/compounds synergize with a sublethal dose of ICI
  and increase drug response in ICI-sensitive cell lines. We also tested whether cotreatment
  of berry extracts reverses the resistant phenotype in ICI-resistant cells, thereby
  leading to an increased cell death in the presence of ICI. \n\nWe used multiple
  cell lines with different molecular characteristics that are representative of the
  ER+ tumors commonly seen in the patient population. The ICI-sensitive cells used
  can be divided into Luminal A and B subtypes  and the resistant cells derived from
  the same subtypes. Further, these cells were also cultured in different media with
  LCC1 and LCC9 in E-deficient medium and all other cell lines in an E-sufficient
  medium. In addition to this, we tested two berry extracts and their representative
  compounds. This complex design was purposely selected to mimic the complex nature
  of breast cancer as it presents in the clinic. In the clinic, we are likely to see
  patients, both pre- and postmenopausal, with ER+ tumors of either subtypes that
  will be treated with ICI. Furthermore, dietary recommendations will involve whole
  fruits and not pure components. So we chose whole berry extracts from two different
  varieties of berries. Finally, we included individual components from each berry
  extract to determine the contribution of the food matrix. \n\nThe results from the
  cell proliferation studies are straightforward and answer many of these questions.
  Both berry extracts and compounds synergize with a sublethal dose of ICI to cause
  an inhibition of cell proliferation in ICI-sensitive cell lines. The berry extracts/compounds
  are most effective in BT-474 cells and least effective in LCC1 cells. The effects
  of the extract/compounds alone vary greatly with the doses used and the type of
  cell-line. We observed that both extracts and compounds had an estrogenic effect
  on LCC1 cells grown in an E-deficient medium-1(d)). This effect was significant
  and dose dependent for EJAE and Del and 1(c)). However, the same extracts/compounds
  showed a dose-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation in ZR75-1 and BT-474 cells
  grown in E-sufficient medium-1(l)). This effect is similar to that observed with
  TAM, which stimulates MCF-7 cell growth under E-deficient, and inhibits proliferation
  under E-sufficient conditions. The SERM activity of TAM reported in literature also
  suggests such effects . Many polyphenolic compounds including those present in berries
  have been reported to show SERM-like effects . Further, they also show a dose-dependent
  selective recruitment of coactivators and repressors to the ER, which dictates whether
  these compounds will act as estrogens or antiestrogens . There are indications toward
  such effects in our study. For example, RRE shows a slight estrogenic effect at
  1 μg/mL, whereas inhibits growth at 10 and 100 μg/mL). Regardless of their effects
  alone, all extracts/compounds tested show varying degrees of either additive or
  synergistic response with ICI in sensitive cells. \n\nAnother important difference
  between the cell lines selected is the HER2 status. Both BT-474 and ZR-75 cells
  are HER2+, whereas LCC1 cells are not . Although all cell lines possess ER, the
  constitutive levels of this receptor vary greatly among these cell lines at baseline.
  Thus, the differential effect of berry extracts/compounds seen among various cell
  lines could be partially explained by these differences. Many berry compounds have
  been shown to deactivate tyrosine kinase signaling and can inhibit HER2-mediated
  effects on cell proliferation. It is clear that in LCC1 cells, the proliferative
  responses seen are ERα-mediated. There is an extract-induced increase in PGR levels),
  which suggests a classic genomic response due to ER activation . Additionally, treatment
  with extracts seems to stabilize ERα levels and antagonize the ICI-mediated degradation
  of ERα in LCC1 cells). The implications of such effects on long-term ICI-treatment
  and resistance development must be explored further.\n\nIn ICI-resistant cells,
  neither extracts nor pure compounds resensitized the cells to lower dose of ICI-2(h)).
  The resistant cells continue to grow in the presence of ICI up to 1 μM and hence
  may be resistant to many chemopreventive agents tested at lower doses. However,
  both EJAE and RRE at all concentrations tested synergize with 1 μM ICI to cause
  a significant reduction in resistant cell growth. A limitation of this study is
  the lack of clear mechanistic detail regarding how berry extracts and compounds
  reduce cell growth. We studied the induction of autophagy using p62, LC3II, and
  Beclin 1 as surrogate markers. Many compounds present in berries have been shown
  to induce autophagy-associated cell death . However, in terms of endocrine resistance,
  autophagy is possibly a survival mechanism and inhibition of autophagy alone, or
  in combination with BCL2+BCLw coinhibition, resensitizes the resistant cells to
  AEs . There is some evidence to suggest that RRE, Del, and EA may interfere with
  autophagy in LCC1 cells. They reverse the ICI-induced degradation of p62 to various
  extent). However, the changes seen in LC3II and Beclin 1 levels contradict this
  argument. It is clear that EJAE ± ICI consistently increases autophagy in both LCC1
  and LCC9 cells. Since we have not directly counted LC3 punctae formation, the data
  is inconclusive as to whether berry extracts/compounds inhibit autophagy and the
  exact mechanisms by which they do so. However, we only analyzed these markers in
  LCC1 and LCC9 cells, where the effects of the extracts/compounds were minimal. The
  assessment of the markers in other cell lines is currently underway and should provide
  a clearer understanding of the various mechanisms by which berry extracts/compounds
  increase cell-line responsiveness to ICI.\n\nOther research into berry extracts
  and compounds have shown similar results, although specific mechanisms vary. Previous
  studies show that the IC50 of RRE in MCF7 cells grown in E-sufficient medium is
  190 μg/mL at 48 h . This is comparable to the effect seen in the ZR75-1 and BT474
  cells, grown under similar conditions, in this study. EJAE has been tested in breast
  cancer cell lines such as MCF7-aro and MDA-MB-231 with an IC50 of 27 and 40 μg/mL,
  respectively, at 72 h . Aqil et al.  have shown that hydrolyzed extract of the Jamun
  fruit pulp was effective in reducing the growth of the non-small cell lung cancer
  cell-line A549 with an IC50 of 59 μg/mL at 72 h. Such studies have typically reported
  the cytotoxic effects of extracts/compounds within 72 h. By contrast, our data presents
  the effect at both 72 h and at 6 d. It is seen that many of the effects at 3 d are
  not carried over at 6 d. This could be due to the clonogenic expansion of the cells
  that were initially unresponsive to the chemopreventive agent. Since effects of
  dietary bioactive compounds on cancer cells are a chronic process, 2 or 3 d cell
  proliferation studies, as is typically performed for a majority of these agents,
  may lead to the overrepresentation of the effectiveness of such compounds. \n\nIn
  conclusion, using a clonogenic assay, we have shown that berry extracts and compounds
  can increase the cell-death response of ICI-sensitive breast cancer lines to a sublethal
  dose of ICI. Further, we also show that this response is largely additive rather
  than synergistic. Additionally, berry extracts resensitize ICI-resistant cells to
  ICI treatment showing a synergistic response, especially at the higher dose. Finally,
  we found that extracts were more effective at lower, physiologically relevant doses
  than at higher experimental doses in some cell lines. These results indicate that
  berry extracts and compounds can potentially interact with ICI in breast epithelial
  cells to alter drug-response. Further in vivo research is warranted regarding the
  implications of such food-drug interactions in response to ICI treatment and the
  development of drug resistance. \n\n\n\nD. R. Woode and H. S. Aiyer contributed
