  Alpha-solanine, a naturally steroidal glycoalkaloid, is found in leaves and fruits
  of plants as a defensive agent against fungi, bacteria and insects. Herein, we investigated
  solanine toxicity in vitro and in vivo, and assessed its protective and the therapeutic
  effects on a typical animal model of breast cancer. The study conducted in three
  series of experiments to obtain  solanine effects on cell viability of mammary carcinoma
  cells,  in vivo toxicity of solanine, and  the protective and therapeutic effects
  of solanine on animal model of breast cancer. Alpha-solanine significantly suppressed
  proliferation of mouse mammary carcinoma cells both in vitro and in vivo. Under
  the dosing procedure, 5 mg/kg solanine has been chosen for assessing its protective
  and therapeutic effects in mice breast cancer. Tumor take rate in the solanine-treated
  group was zero compared with a 75% rate in its respective control group. The average
  tumor size and weight were significantly lower in solanine-treated animals than
  its respective control ones. Proapoptotic Bax protein expression increased in breast
  tumor by solanine compared with its respective control group. Antiapoptotic Bcl-2
  protein expression found to be lower in solanine-treated animals. Proliferative
  and angiogenic parameters greatly decreased in solanine-treated mice. Data provide
  evidence that solanine exerts a significant chemoprotective and chemotherapeutic
  effects on an animal model of breast cancer through apoptosis induction, cell proliferation
  and angiogenesis inhibition. These findings reveal a new therapeutic potential for
  solanine in cancer.'
