  and processed meat intake and risk of breast cancer a meta-analysis of prospective
  studies.md
text: "\n\nEpidemiological studies regarding the association between red and processed
  meat intake and the risk of breast cancer have yielded inconsistent results. Therefore,
  we conducted an updated and comprehensive meta-analysis which included 14 prospective
  studies to evaluate the association of red and processed meat intake with breast
  cancer risk. Relevant prospective cohort studies were identified by searching PubMed
  through October 31, 2014, and by reviewing the reference lists of retrieved articles.
  Study-specific relative risk  estimates were pooled using a random-effects model.
  Fourteen prospective studies on red meat  and 12 prospective studies on processed
  meat were included in the meta-analysis. The summary RRs  of breast cancer for the
  highest versus the lowest categories were 1.10  for red meat, and 1.08  for processed
  meat. The estimated summary RRs  were 1.11  for an increase of 120 g/day of red
  meat, and 1.09  for an increase of 50 g/day of processed meat. Our findings indicate
  that increased intake of red and processed meat is associated with an increased
  risk of breast cancer. Further research with well-designed cohort or interventional
  studies is needed to confirm the association.\n\nBreast cancer is the most common
  cancer in women worldwide. It is also the major cause of death from cancer among
  women globally. It is reported that one in eight U.S. women  will be diagnosed with
  breast cancer in her lifetime. In 2014, about 232,340 new cases of invasive breast
  cancer will be diagnosed in women, and 39,620 women will die from breast cancer
  in the United States. Thus, to facilitate disease prevention, it is of great importance
  to identify potential risk factors for breast cancer, especially the modifiable
  life-style factors including diet. Recently, an increasing number of studies have
  been carried out to explore the associations between red and/or processed meat intake
  and the risk of breast cancer, but the results have been inconsistent.\n\nAn early
  quantitative review done in 2010 demonstrated that red meat and processed meat intake
  does not appear to be independently associated with increased risk of breast cancer.
  Since then, five more epidemiologic studies evaluating the association of red and
  processed meat intake with breast cancer risk have yielded inconsistent results.
  Of these five studies, two prospective cohort studies in 2014 by Farvid et al.  found
  a positive association between red meat intake and breast cancer risk. Another study
  using data from the SU.VI.MAX study observed that processed meat intake was prospectively
  associated with increased breast cancer risk. However, the other two studies reported
  null associations. Therefore, we conducted an updated and comprehensive meta-analysis
  of prospective studies to better characterize this issue.\n\nA computerized literature
  search was conducted in PubMed  from its inception through October 2014, by two
  independent researchers. We searched the relevant studies with the following medical
  subject-heading terms and/or text words:  breast cancer OR breast neoplasm;  meat
  OR red meat OR processed meat OR preserved meat OR pork OR beef OR veal OR mutton
  OR lamb OR ham OR sausage OR bacon;  cohort OR prospective OR nested casecontrol,
  following the meta-analysis of observation studies in epidemiology guidelines. Furthermore,
  we carried out a broader search on diet or foods and breast cancer and reviewed
  lists of the relevant articles to identify additional studies. No language restriction
  was imposed.\n\nStudies were included in the meta-analysis if the studies met the
  following criteria:  peer-reviewed publications of prospective cohort studies or
  nested casecontrol studies;  the exposure studied was red meat or processed meat,
  and the outcome of interest was incidence of or mortality from breast cancer; and
  \ relative risk  with corresponding 95 % CI was presented. If the articles were
  duplicated or from the same study population, the more recent or complete study
  was included. Casecontrol studies, ecological assessments, correlation studies,
  experimental animal studies, and mechanistic studies were excluded. We finally identified
  14 prospective studies that reported results for red meat or processed meat consumption
  in relation to risk of breast cancer according to the criteria listed above.\n\nTwo
  independent researchers extracted the following data from each study: the first
  authors last name, year of publication, country where the study was conducted, number
  of cases, cohort size, years of follow-up, type of meat, RR with corresponding 95
  % CIs for the highest versus the lowest level, and adjusted variables. Attempts
  were also made to contact investigators if the data of interested were not directly
  presented in the publications. When several risk estimates were present, the estimates
  adjusted for the greatest number of potential confounders were extracted. The NewcastleOttawa
  scale was used to assess the study quality.\n\nA random-effects model was used to
  calculate the summary relative risks and 95 % CIs for the highest versus the lowest
  level of red and processed meat intake. This model was developed by DerSimonian
  and Laird, which accounts for heterogeneity among studies. For the dose-response
  meta-analysis, we used generalized least squares trend estimation analysis based
  on the methods proposed by Greenland and Longnecker  and Orsini. This method requires
  the number of cases and non-cases  and the RR with its variance estimate for at
  least three quantitative exposure categories. When studies did not provide this
  information, we estimated the slopes using variance-weighted least squares regression.
  When the included studies used different units, we converted them into grams per
  day using 120 or 50 g as the average portion size for red meat or processed meat,
  respectively.\n\nStatistical heterogeneity among studies was evaluated using the
  Cochrans Q and I 2 statistics. Heterogeneity was considered present for P ; 0.05
  or I 2  50 %. Sources of heterogeneity were explored in stratified analysis by study
  location, menopausal status, and adjusted confounders. We also conducted sensitivity
  analysis to estimate the influence of each individual study on the summary results
  by repeating the random-effects meta-analysis after omitting one study at a time.
  Publication bias was assessed using funnel plots, and the further evaluated by Eggers
  linear regression and Beggs rank correlation test. A two-tailed P value &lt; 0.05
  was considered representative of significant statistical publication bias. All statistical
  analyses were performed using STATA, version 11.0.\n\nThe flowchart of the identification
  of relevant studies is shown in Fig. 1. A total of 172 articles were identified
  by searching of the database, and 16 of these articles were retrieved for full-text
  review. After excluding 2 publications that represented the same population, 14
  cohort/nest casecontrol studies were selected for use in our meta-analysis. Characteristics
  of the included studies are shown in Table 1. The 14 cohort studies  comprised a
  total of 1588,890 participants and 31,552 breast cancer cases, and 3 studies were
  secondary analyses of randomized controlled trial data. Among the 14 studies evaluated,
  6 were conducted in the United States, 6 in Europe, 1 in North America and Western
  Europe, and 1 in Asia.\n\nCharacteristics of prospective studies of red meat and

  red meat intake and the risk of breast cancer were included in the meta-analysis.
  The summary RR of breast cancer was 1.10  for subjects in the highest category of
  red meat intake compared with those in the lowest category. Statistically significant
  heterogeneity was detected. No publication bias was observed by Beggs test  or by
  Eggers test. Eleven studies  were eligible to have required data for dose-response
  analysis, and the estimated summary RR of breast cancer of an increase in red meat
  intake of 120 g/day was 1.11 ; no significant heterogeneity was observed.\n\nIn
  stratified analysis by menopausal status, the summary RR of breast cancer for subjects
  in the highest category of red meat intake compared with those in the lowest category
  was 1.08  for premenopausal women, and 1.20  for postmenopausal women. Furthermore,
  in stratified analysis by geographic region, the summary RR was similar for studies
  conducted in the United States  and Europe.\n\nRelative risks of breast cancer comparing

  size were calculated by removing one study at a time, we confirmed the stability
  of the positive association between red meat intake and breast cancer risk.\n\nTwelve
  cohort studies  that examined the association between processed meat intake and
  the risk of breast cancer were included in the meta-analysis. The summary RR of
  breast cancer was 1.08  for subjects in the highest category of processed meat intake
  compared with those in the lowest category. Statistically significant heterogeneity
  was detected, and publication bias was not evidenced by Beggs test, but was observed
  by Eggers test. Seven studies  were eligible to have required data for dose-response
  analysis, and the estimated summary RR of breast cancer of an increase in processed
  meat intake of 50 g/day was 1.09 ; no significant heterogeneity was observed.\n\nRelative

  cancer for subjects in the highest category of processed meat intake compared with
  those in the lowest category was 1.03  for premenopausal women, and 1.23  for postmenopausal
  women. Furthermore, in stratified analysis by geographic region, the summary RR
  was 1.04   for studies conducted in the United States, and 1.16   for studies conducted
  in the Europe.\n\nFunnel plot for prospective studies of red meat and breast cancer.
  \n\nIn this comprehensive updated meta-analysis, higher red and processed meat intake
  was found to be associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. The summary
  risk of breast cancer for the highest versus the lowest categories increased by
  10 % for red meat, and 8 % for processed meat. The results were consistent when
  using dose-response analysis.\n\nA previous meta-analysis of red and processed meat
  consumption and breast cancer was conducted by Alexander et al. in 2009. That study
  found weak positive summary associations across all meta-analysis models, with the
  majority being non-statistically significant. Moreover, only 11 studies were included
  in the previous meta-analysis. However, since then, a number of large-scale prospective
  epidemiologic studies have evaluated the association between red and processed meat
  intake and breast cancer risk. For example, one study with 20 years of follow-up
  among 88,803 premenopausal women from the Nurses Health Study II found that greater
  intake of total red meat was associated with an increased risk of breast cancer.
  Another study with 13-year follow-up by Farvid MS et al.  also observed that higher
  consumption of total red meat in adolescence was significantly associated with increased
  premenopausal breast cancer risk. Using the data from the SU.VI.MAX study, Pouchieu
  C et al. demonstrated that processed meat intake was prospectively associated with
  increased breast cancer risk. In the current updated meta-analysis, after excluding
  the studies from the same study population, we finally included 14 prospective studies
  and found statistically significant relationship between red and processed meat
  consumption and breast cancer risk.\n\nSeveral suggested biological mechanisms might
  explain the positive association between red meat or processed meat intake and breast
  cancer risk. The first mechanism concerns the heme iron and non-heme iron. Iron,
  which has a pro-oxidant activity, has been suggested as a risk factor for many types
  of cancers. However, epidemiological studies have yielded mixed and contentious
  results regarding the relationship between iron and breast cancer. Moreover, a cohort
  study included in our meta-analysis revealed that adjusting for heme iron did not
  appreciably change the association between red meat intake and breast cancer risk,
  indicating that heme iron might not be a major causal fact for the association between
  red meat intake and breast cancer risk. Another important mechanism that may explain
  the positive association relates to the presence of some carcinogenic compounds
  like the heterocyclic amines  and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, by-products
  that are produced in the process of high-temperature cooking of red meat. Several
  human studies have demonstrated a positive association between HCA and PAH intake
  and overall breast cancer risks. In addition, hormone residues of the exogenous
  hormones used to treat beef cattle also are recognized as possible sources of the
  positive association between red meat intake and breast cancer risk. Recently, a
  new study published on PNAS has revealed that the animal sugar molecule N-glycolylneuraminic
  acid, which is highly enriched in red meat, would be absorbed and accumulated in
  human tissues, and eventually lead to chronic inflammation and tumor formation.\n\nOur
  meta-analysis has several strengths. Firstly, the assessment was based on prospective
  studies, which tend to be less likely to have recall and selection bias than retrospective
  casecontrol studies. Moreover, our studies included a large sample size  which would
  have a much greater possibility of reaching detecting smaller associations and performing
  subgroup analysis. However, there were also some limitations in this meta-analysis.
  First, the inherent problems of residual confounders in the included studies are
  of concern in the meta-analysis of observational studies. Most of the studies included
  in our meta-analysis controlled for a wide range of confounders, and some of these
  studies even had controlled for postmenopausal hormone treatment and Hormone replacement
  therapy. However, we still cannot exclude the possibility that other inadequately
  measured factors such as environmental pollution  and sleep quality, which might
  confound the association, should be included in the future studies. Second, our
  findings are likely to be affected by the misclassification of meat. In the studies
  included in our meta-analysis, the term red meat referred to total red meat, corresponding
  to processed red meat in some studies and to unprocessed red meat in other studies.
  However, misclassification is generally non-differential in cohort studies, which
  would most likely attenuate the association. Third, the intake quantity and consumption
  levels in the highest and lowest categories varied across studies, which might contribute
  the heterogeneity among studies in the analysis of the highest versus the lowest
  intake categories. To account for these differences, we also estimated the relative
  risks of breast cancer for an increase intake of red meat of 120 g/day and of processed
  meat of 50 g/day, and similar results were observed. Finally, as with any meta-analysis,
  publication bias could be of concern, because studies with null results or small
  sample sizes tend not to be published. Thus, the summary results may overestimate
  the relative risk of breast cancer with red and/or processed meat intake.\n\nIn
  conclusion, the overall results of the present study suggest that high intake of
  red and/or processed meat is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer.
  However, additional well-designed cohort or interventional studies will be needed
  to confirm the association.\n\nThe study was supported by grants from the Ministry
