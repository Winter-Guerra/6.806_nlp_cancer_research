  breast cancers by interacting with the estrogen signaling pathways. Paracrine interactions
  between malignant epithelial cells and proximal stromal cells are responsible for
  local estrogen biosynthesis. In human breast cancer cells and peritumoral adipose
  tissue, melatonin downregulates aromatase, which transforms androgens into estrogens.
  The presence of aromatase on endothelial cells indicates that endothelial cells
  may contribute to tumor growth by producing estrogens. Since human umbilical vein
  endothelial cells express both aromatase and melatonin receptors, the aim of the
  present study was to evaluate the ability of melatonin to regulate the activity
  and expression of aromatase on endothelial cells, thus, modulating local estrogen
  biosynthesis. In the present study, we demonstrated that melatonin inhibits the
  growth of HUVECs and reduces the local biosynthesis of estrogens through the downregulation
  of aromatase. These results are supported by three lines of evidence. Firstly, 1
  mM of melatonin counteracted the testosterone-induced cell proliferation of HUVECs,
  which is dependent on the local biosynthesis of estrogens from testosterone by the
  aromatase activity of the cells. Secondly, we found that 1 mM of melatonin reduced
  the aromatase activity of HUVECs. Finally, by real‑time RT-PCR, we demonstrated
  that melatonin significantly downregulated the expression of aromatase as well as
  its endothelial-specific aromatase promoter region I.7. We conclude that melatonin
  inhibits aromatase activity and expression in HUVECs by regulating gene expression
  of specific aromatase promoter regions, thereby reducing the local production of
  estrogens.\n\n\n\nThe pathogenesis and growth of breast cancer are linked to estrogens.
  High levels of estradiol found in some breast tumors occur due to the uptake from
  the circulation or from in situ biosynthesis. One of the main pathways involved
  in the synthesis of estrogens in breast tumors is the aromatase pathway, which is
  responsible for the conversion of androgens into estrogens in extragonadal sites.
  The importance of the local biosynthesis of estrogens is highlighted by the high
  incidence of hormone-dependent breast cancer in postmenopausal women and, consequently,
  aromatase inhibitors have become a successful treatment in this disease.\n\nMelatonin,
  the main secretory product of the pineal gland, is widely known to reduce the growth
  and development of estrogen-responsive breast cancers. Melatonin exerts its oncostatic
  properties in hormone-dependent breast cancer by interfering at different levels
  with estrogen signaling pathways. One of the mechanisms through which this occurs
  is based on the regulation by melatonin of both expression and activity of several
  enzymes, particularly aromatase which is involved in the biosynthesis of estrogens
  in the peripheral tissues; thus, melatonin behaves as a selective estrogen enzyme
  modulator. In breast cancer cells which express aromatase and the MT1 melatonin
  receptor, melatonin inhibits aromatase activity and also downregulates aromatase
  expression at the transcriptional level. In vivo evidence of the modulator effect
  of melatonin on the enzyme aromatase has also been described in rats bearing dimethylbenzanthracene-induced
  mammary tumors.\n\nSeveral lines of evidence highlight the contribution of the tumor
  microenvironment to tumor growth and maintenance. Adjacent adipose fibroblasts and
  vascular endothelial cells provide structural and biochemical support for tumor
  growth, mainly by increasing their estrogen biosynthesis in response to paracrine
  signals which are secreted by malignant breast epithelial cells in a phenomenon
  known as the desmoplastic reaction. Recently, our group demonstrated that melatonin
  interferes in the desmoplastic reaction by inhibiting adipocyte differentiation
  and decreasing both the aromatase activity and expression in adipose fibroblasts,
  thereby reducing the number of cells contributing to estrogen production in the
  tumor adjacent tissue. Adjacent adipose tissue surrounding malignant cells seems
  to account for the majority of aromatase expression in breast tumors. Endothelial
  cells surrounding tumor cells, may provide another source of estrogens since they
  also express aromatase. A single gene encodes aromatase and its expression is directed
  by alternative promoter use in a complex and tissue-specific manner. Normal breast
  adipose tissue maintains low levels of aromatase expression, primarily via promoter
  I.4. However, in mammary cancer, aromatase levels are increased by the activation
  of promoters II and I.3, both in malignant epithelial cells and adjacent adipose
  fibroblasts. Recent studies have led to the identification and characterization
  of the novel aromatase promoter I.7 which is upregulated in breast cancer tissue.
  This promoter contains endothelial cell-specific cis-acting elements and its activity
  has been demonstrated in an endothelial cell line.\n\nIn human breast cancer cells,
  melatonin inhibits aromatase expression by decreasing the activity of promoters
  I.3 and II. The binding of melatonin to the MT1 receptor present in MCF-7 cells
  has been described as a first step in the antiaromatase action of melatonin. Since
  vascular endothelial cells express aromatase and melatonin receptors and given the
  antiaromatase properties of melatonin, in the present study we explored the role
  of melatonin on the regulation of aromatase in the human umbilical vein endothelial
  cell line and its contribution to local estrogen biosynthesis in the tumor microenvironment.\n\n\n\n\n\nHuman
  umbilical vein endothelial cells were purchased from the American Tissue Culture
  Collection. They were maintained as monolayer cultures in 75-cm2 plastic culture
  flasks in Vascular Cell Basal Medium supplemented with Endothelial Cell Growth Kit-BBE
  which consists of 2% fetal bovine serum, 0.2% bovine brain extract, 5 ng/ml rhEGF,
  10 mM L-glutamine, 0.75 U/ml heparin sulfate, 1 μg/ml hydrocortisone hemisuccinate,
  50 μg/ml ascorbic acid, penicillin and streptomycin at 37°C in a humid atmosphere
  containing 5% CO2. To avoid genetic mutation and low viability, no more than six
  passages of HUVECs were used for the following experiments.\n\n\n\nHUVECs were seeded
  into 96-multi-well plates at a density of 7×103 cells/well in VCBM supplemented
  with 2% FBS and incubated at 37°C. After 24 h of incubation, media were aspirated
  and replaced by fresh media supplemented with 5% charcoal-stripped FBS and containing
  either 1 mM, 10 μM, 100 nM, 1 nM melatonin and/or 10 nM estradiol and/or vehicle.
  Cells were cultured for 3 days. Cell proliferation was measured by the MTT  method,
  reading the absorbance at 570 nm in a microplate reader. MTT was obtained from Molecular
  Probes Inc..\n\n\n\nIndirect measurement of aromatase activity of HUVECs was obtained
  by evaluating cell proliferation in estrogen-free media in the presence of testosterone.
  Under these conditions, cell growth depends on the transformation of androgens to
  estrogens via the aromatase activity of the cells. To test this, HUVECs were seeded
  in 96-multi-well culture plates at a density of 7×103 cells/well in VCBM supplemented
  with 2% FBS and incubated at 37°C. After 24 h of incubation, media were replaced
  by others supplemented with 2% sFBS containing either testosterone, melatonin, the
  aromatase inhibitor aminoglutethimide or vehicle. Cell proliferation was assessed
  after 3 days of culture by using the MTT method.\n\n\n\nAromatase activity in HUVECs
  was measured by the tritiated water release assay which is based on the formation
  of tritiated water during aromatization of a labeled androgenic substrate such as
  androst-4-ene-3,17-dione . HUVECs were seeded onto 75-cm2 plastic culture flasks
  in VCBM supplemented with 2% FBS. When a homogenous monolayer of preconfluent HUVECs
  was reached, media were aspirated and replaced with serum-free media containing
  300 nM of the labeled substrate androst-4-ene-3,17-dione  in the presence of melatonin
  or the diluent. After 24 h of incubation, culture flasks were placed on ice for
  15 min to condense any water vapor, and media were transferred to tubes containing
  0.25 ml ice-cold 30% tricholoroacetic acid, vortexed and centrifuged at 1700 × g
  for 20 min. The supernatants were extracted with chloroform, vortexed and centrifuged
  at 1700 × g for 20 min. The resulting aqueous supernatants were adsorbed with 10%
  dextran-coated charcoal, vortexed, centrifuged at 1700 × g for 20 min. and the supernatants
  were added to vials with scintillation cocktail and counted in a beta counter. The
  amount of radioactivity measured in -water was corrected by substracting the blank
  values from each sample, obtained by incubating dishes containing medium with the
  tritiated androgen but no cells. The values were also corrected by taking into account
  the fractional retention of tritium in medium water throughout the processing, utilizing
  parallel dishes containing medium plus known amounts of -water through incubation
  and assay. The fractional retention of tritium in medium water throughout the incubation
  and processing of samples was consistently &gt;85%.\n\n\n\nAnalysis of the aromatase
  and aromatase promoter I.7 mRNA expression in HUVECs was carried out by real-time
  reverse transcription RT-PCR after incubation of cells with melatonin or vehicle
  for 4 h. The total cellular RNA was isolated from HUVECs and purified with the NucleoSpin
  RNA II kit following the manufacturers instructions. Integrity of RNA was assessed
  by electrophoresis in ethidium bromide-stained 1% agarose-Tris-borate EDTA gels.
  The absorbance ratio A260 nm/A280 nm was &gt;1.8. For cDNA synthesis, 1 μg of total
  RNA was denatured at 65°C for 10 min and reverse transcribed for 50 min at 45°C
  with a cDNA synthesis kit in a final volume of 20 μl in the presence of 500 ng of
  oligo(dT)12–18 primers. Primers used for amplification of aromatase and aromatase
  promoter I.7, using the housekeeping gene s14, are listed in Table I. Real-time
  PCRs were performed in an MX3000 using Brilliant® SYBR® Green PCR Master Mix, following
  the manufacturers instructions. Amplifications were performed for 40 cycles using
  the following temperature profile: 55°C for 45 sec; 72°C for 30 sec and 95°C for
  30 sec.  \n\n\n\n\nPrimers used for amplification of mRNA transcripts of human aromatase,
  aromatase promoter region pI.7 and s14.  \n\n\n\n\n\nThe data are expressed as the
  means ± standard errors of the mean of six independent experiments. Statistical
  differences between groups were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance, followed
  by the Student-Newman-Keuls test. Results were considered as statistically significant
  at P;0.05.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo investigate the effect of melatonin on HUVEC growth, cells
  were cultured in VCBM supplemented with 5% sFBS in the presence of different concentrations
  of melatonin. Proliferation of HUVECs in the presence of melatonin was significantly
  decreased while other concentrations of melatonin had no effects. The addition of
  17β-estradiol into the media stimulated cell proliferation. This stimulatory effect
  of estradiol on cell proliferation was significantly counteracted by melatonin.
  \ \n\n\n\n\nIndirect evidence of aromatase activity in HUVECs was obtained by evaluating
  cell proliferation in estrogen-free media in the presence of testosterone. Testosterone
  significantly increased HUVEC proliferation following culture for 3 days in media
  with sFBS. This stimulatory effect of testosterone was reduced by the aromatase
  inhibitor aminoglutethimide, thus, indicating that, at least in part, cell proliferation
  was dependent on the formation of estrogens from testosterone by the aromatase activity
  of the cells. Melatonin was also able to counteract the stimulatory effect of testosterone
  to values below those obtained by aminoglutethimide, which is indicative of an inhibitory
  effect on aromatase exerted by melatonin.  \n\n\n\n\nThe aromatase activity of HUVECs
  incubated for 24 h with tritiated androstenedione was estimated by the formation
  of tritiated water. Melatonin at pharmacological concentrations significantly decreased
  the aromatase activity of HUVECs. Melatonin induced a significant 60% inhibition
  of the aromatase activity of the HUVECs.  \n\n\n\n\nWith the aim of determining
  whether the inhibitory effect of melatonin on aromatase activity is due to the downregulation
  of aromatase expression, we incubated HUVECs with either melatonin or vehicle for
  4 h, and total RNA was isolated to perform real-time quantitative PCR with specific
  primers for human aromatase. As a control, the same samples were subjected to real-time
  quantitative PCR with specific primers for the housekeeping gene s14, a ribosomal
  protein component of the 40S subunit. Melatonin treatment exhibited a significant
  and potent inhibition in aromatase mRNA expression in HUVECs.  \n\n\nTo determine
  whether aromatase promoter I.7, an aromatase promoter mainly active in vascular
  endothelial cells in breast cancer, is involved in the melatonin regulation of aromatase
  expression, we used real-time quantitative PCR to amplify the aromatase endothelial-specific
  promoter I.7 transcripts from RNA extracted from HUVECs. As shown in Fig. 4B, melatonin
  significantly downregulated the gene expression of the aromatase promoter I.7.\n\n\n\nThe
  relevance of estrogens in the growth and pathogenesis of hormone-dependent breast
  cancer is supported by extensive experimental and epidemiological evidence. In premenopausal
  non-pregnant women, estrogen synthesis occurs mainly in the ovary. However, in postmenopausal
  women local estrogen biosynthesis in extraovarian sites has great relevance. Extraovarian
  estrogen biosynthesis is directed by different enzymes which transform androgens
  into estrogens as well as compounds of weak estrogenic activity into more active
  forms. All of these locally produced steroid hormones contribute to the genesis
  and development of breast tumors as well as other types of tumors such as endometrial
  and ovary carcinoma. Targeting aromatase has proven beneficial in treating breast
  cancer, and aromatase inhibitors are being used clinically as chemotherapeutic agents
  for hormone-dependent breast cancer.\n\nMelatonin, the main pineal hormone, is well
  known for its oncostatic properties. This indoleamine exerts its oncostatic effects
  on estrogen-dependent breast tumors mainly by two mechanisms: interfering with the
  estrogen signaling pathways at the estrogen receptor level and regulating both the
  activity and expression of the enzymes involved in local estrogen biosynthesis.
  In relation with the modulator effect of melatonin on the aromatase enzyme, it is
  known that melatonin inhibits aromatase activity and expression in vitro in human
  breast cancer cells, as well as in vivo in rats bearing DMBA-induced mammary tumors.
  Since in breast cancer tissue aromatase expression in stromal cells adjacent to
  tumor cells seems to account for the majority of aromatase expression in breast
  tumors, and because it is known that melatonin decreases the aromatase activity
  and expression in adipose fibroblasts surrounding malignant cells, in this study,
  we investigated whether melatonin is able to regulate the production of estrogens
  in endothelial cells. To accomplish this, we used HUVECs which are known to express
  aromatase and melatonin receptors.\n\nAccording to previous findings, melatonin
  added to the culture decreased HUVEC growth. This melatonin concentration reduced
  HUVEC proliferation by 50% after 3 days of culture. Interestingly, the addition
  of estradiol significantly increased HUVEC growth and melatonin counteracted this
  stimulatory effect. This finding is consistent with the proangiogenic effects of
  estradiol that have been described by other authors both in vivo and in vitro(43)
  and is a consequence of the presence of estrogen receptors in endothelial cells,
  which enables the response to this hormone. The present study demonstrated that
  melatonin at a 1-mM concentration reduced the synthesis of estrogens in HUVECs through
  the inhibition of aromatase, the enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting step in
  the conversion of androgens to estrogens. These results are supported by three types
  of experiments. In the first experimental series, we demonstrated that melatonin
  counteracted the stimulatory effects of testosterone on HUVEC growth cultured in
  estrogen-free media. Under these conditions, the proliferative effects of testosterone
  depend on the local biosynthesis of estrogens from testosterone carried out by the
  aromatase activity of the cells. Thus, the inhibitory effects of melatonin could
  be due to its antiaromatase activity. In a second series of experiments, we directly
  measured the aromatase activity of HUVECs by the tritiated water release assay,
  finding that this was reduced by melatonin at a 1-mM concentration, which is the
  same concentration that gives the highest antiproliferative effects in HUVECs. Finally,
  we evaluated the possible role of melatonin on the modulation of aromatase at the
  transcriptional level in HUVECs and we demonstrated that 1 mM of melatonin induced
  a marked decrease in the expression of mRNA aromatase in the HUVECs.\n\nTo our knowledge,
  this is the first time that the effects of melatonin on aromatase activity and expression
  in endothelial cells have been established. However, the antiaromatase properties
  of melatonin have been solidly described in several other cell lines. Melatonin
  modulates the transformation of androgens to estrogens in breast cancer cells and
  adjacent adipose fibroblasts as well as in glioma cells through the inhibition of
  aromatase activity and expression. The aromatase enzyme is encoded by one single
  gene and its tissue-specific expression is regulated by alternative splicing mechanisms.
  In the disease-free breast, aromatase is expressed in the mammary adipose tissue
  mainly by the relatively weak promoter I.4. However, in breast cancer tissue, both
  in malignant epithelial cells and surrounding fibroblasts, aromatase expression
  is mainly driven by the activation of promoters I.3 and II. In human breast cancer
  cells, melatonin inhibits aromatase expression by decreasing the activity of promoters
  I.3 and II. In vascular endothelial cells of breast cancer, promoter I.7 has been
  identified, which is a novel breast cancer-associated aromatase promoter mainly
  active in vascular endothelial cells in breast cancer. Promoter I.7 contains a crucial
  GATA-binding site characteristic of a promoter of endothelial cell origin even though
  it is also present in adipose tissue adjacent to breast tumors. Excessive aromatase
  expression via promoters I.3, II and I.7 and the consequent increase in estrogen
  biosynthesis in malignant epithelial cells, undifferentiated adipose fibroblasts
  and adjacent endothelial cells contribute to the development and progression of
  breast cancer. This study shows that melatonin-dependent regulation of aromatase
  gene expression occurs mainly through downregulation of gene expression of the specific
  aromatase promoter region I.7 in HUVECs. Extensive angiogenesis, which consists
  of the formation of new blood vessels from existing endothelium, is a hallmark of
  aggressive tumor growth. The ability of estrogens to stimulate angiogenesis has
  been well-established. Overexpression of aromatase from aromatase promoter I.7 in
  vascular endothelial tissue surrounding breast tumors may contribute to the growth
  of breast cancer by two mechanisms. Firstly, the elevated in situ aromatase activity
  may increase the local estrogen concentration thus directly affecting tumoral growth.
  Secondly, the high estrogen concentration would presumably promote angiogenesis.\n\nThe
  effects of melatonin on cancer cells are dependent on melatonin concentrations,
  duration of exposure and the characteristics of cells being tested. In the present
  study, only pharmacological concentrations of melatonin were effective. In previous
  studies, a strong inhibitory effect induced by nanomolar concentrations of melatonin
  on human breast cancer cells was described. However, high concentrations of melatonin
  are necessary to obtain oncostatic actions in other types of normal and cancer cells.
  Melatonin is a highly lipid-soluble indolamine which may easily cross the blood-brain
  barrier, and there is evidence that the melatonin concentration in the cerebrospinal
  fluid is higher than that in blood. Melatonin is also 3-fold more concentrated in
  neoplastic and adipose tissue of the breast. These high concentrations of melatonin
  in certain tissues may contribute towards the explanation of why high levels of
  melatonin are necessary to obtain various oncostatic actions of melatonin.\n\nThe
  findings present herein point to a role of melatonin in mediating the aromatase
  activity and expression in human endothelial cells by regulating the gene expression
  of specific aromatase promoter regions. Since the enzymes responsible for estrogen
  biosynthesis in tumoral tissue constitute a pharmacological target by which to selectively
  reduce the effects of estrogens in hormone-dependent cancers, the development of
  drugs that inhibit these enzymes is currently a major strategy for treating and
  preventing carcinogenesis. Antiaromatase properties of the pineal hormone make melatonin
  an attractive compound to be tested for its possible therapeutic value in breast
  cancer.\n\n\n\n"
