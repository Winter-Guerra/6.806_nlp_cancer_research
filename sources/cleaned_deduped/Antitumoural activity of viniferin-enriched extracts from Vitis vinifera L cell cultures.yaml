  activity of viniferin-enriched extracts from Vitis vinifera L cell cultures.md
text: '


  The aim of this work was to evaluate the effect of stilbenes from different cultivars
  of Vitis vinifera on tumour proliferation. Extracts were obtained from elicited
  V. vinifera cell cultures and characterised by HPLC/DAD/MS. Cell growth was evaluated
  in four human cancer cell lines and in normal human fibroblasts. The cells were
  exposed to the extracts or to trans-resveratrol, used as reference molecule, for
  48 h, at 110 M concentrations of total stilbenoids. All the extracts exhibited antiproliferative
  activity, mediated by modulation of the cell cycle and induction of cytotoxicity
  in cancer but not in normal cell lines, and positively correlated with the content
  in dimeric stilbenoids. The Alphonse Lavalle extract was the most active, and the
  obtained stilbenoid fraction resulted 810 times more active than trans-resveratrol.
  Extracts from V. vinifera cell cultures could represent new sources of active stilbenoid
  compounds to be further assayed in in vivo studies for their antitumoural properties.'
