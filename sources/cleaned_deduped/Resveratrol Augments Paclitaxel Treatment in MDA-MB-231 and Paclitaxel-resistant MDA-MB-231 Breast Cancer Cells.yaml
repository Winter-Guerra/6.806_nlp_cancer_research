  Background: Resveratrol inhibits cell growth, induces apoptosis and augments chemotherapeutics
  in multiple cancer types, although its effects on drug-resistant cancer cells are
  unknown. Materials and Methods: To study the effects of resveratrol in triple-negative
  breast cancer cells that are resistant to the common cancer drug, paclitaxel, a
  novel paclitaxel-resistant cell line was generated from the MDA-MB-231 cell line.
  Results: The resistant MDA-MB-231/PacR cells exhibited a 12-fold increased resistance
  to paclitaxel. RES treatment reduced cell proliferation and colony formation and
  increased senescence and apoptosis in both parental and resistant cells. Importantly,
  RES augmented the effects of paclitaxel in both cell lines. Up-regulation of the
  MDR1 and CYP2C8 genes were shown to be potential mechanisms of paclitaxel resistance
  in the resistant cells. Conclusion: RES, both alone and in combination with paclitaxel,
  may be useful in the treatment of paclitaxel-sensitive and paclitaxel-resistant
  triple-negative breast cancer cells. '
