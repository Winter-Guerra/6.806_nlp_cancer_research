  Background This study investigated the effect of a broad range of dietary ratios
  of n-3:n-6 fatty acids on mammary gland density and mammary cancer risk. Methods
  Cancer was induced in female rats by N-methyl-N-nitrosourea. Purified diet that
  provided 30% of dietary kcal from fat was formulated to contain ratios of n-3:n-6
  fatty acids from 25:1 to 1:25. MD was determined by digital analysis, fatty acids
  by gas chromatography/flame ionization detection and other plasma analytes via ELISA.
  Results MD was reduced dose dependently at n-3:n-6 ratios from 1:1 to 25:1, with
  a 20.3% decrease of MD between n-3:n-6 of 1:1 versus 25:1, P;0.001. Mammary carcinogenesis
  was inhibited in the absence or presence of tamoxifen in a manner predicted by MD.
  Plasma n-3 fatty acid concentrations failed to increase above an n-3:n-6 ratio of
  5:1, and changes in specific plasma n-3 or n-6 fatty acids were not predictive of
  MD or cancer inhibitory activity. A strong reciprocal effect of the n-3:n-6 ratio
  on plasma leptin and adiponectin was observed indicating adipose tissue function
  was modulated. However, neither cytokine was predictive of MD. Plasma IGF-1 decreased
  with increasing dietary n-3:n-6 ratio and was predictive of the changes in MD. Conclusions
  These findings indicate that 1) MD predicted the carcinogenic response, 2) the n-3:n-6
  ratio exerts effects in the presence or absence of hormonal regulation of carcinogenesis
  and 3) signaling pathways regulated by IGF-1 are potential targets for further mechanistic
  investigation. '
