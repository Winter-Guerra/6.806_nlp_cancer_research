  Chemotherapy resistance represents a major problem for the treatment of patients
  with breast cancer and greatly restricts the use of first-line chemotherapeutics
  paclitaxel. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of transgelin
  2 in human breast cancer paclitaxel resistance cell line and the reversal mechanism
  of salvianolic acid A, a phenolic active compound extracted from Salvia miltiorrhiza.
  Western blotting and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction indicated
  that transgelin 2 may mediate paclitaxel resistance by activating the phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway to suppress MCF-7/PTX cells apoptosis. The reversal
  ability of SAA was confirmed by MTT assay and flow cytometry, with a superior 9.1-fold
  reversal index and enhancement of the apoptotic cytotoxicity induced by paclitaxel.
  In addition, SAA effectively prevented transgelin 2 and adenosine-triphosphate binding
  cassette transporter including P-glycoprotein, multidrug resistance associated protein
  1, and breast cancer resistance protein up-regulation and exhibited inhibitory effect
  on PI3 K/Akt signaling pathway in MCF-7/PTX cells. Taken together, SAA can reverse
  paclitaxel resistance through suppressing transgelin 2 expression by mechanisms
  involving attenuation of PI3 K/Akt pathway activation and ABC transporter up-regulation.
  These results not only provide insight into the potential application of SAA in
  reversing paclitaxel resistance, thus facilitating the sensitivity of breast cancer
  chemotherapy, but also highlight a potential role of transgelin 2 in the development
  of paclitaxel resistance in breast cancer.'
