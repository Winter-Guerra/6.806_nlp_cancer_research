  The mustard family – Brassicaceae – is well known as family of plants, metallophytes,
  which are able to accumulate wide range of heavy metals and metalloids, especially
  zinc and cadmium, but also nickel, thallium, chromium and selenium. Ecological importance
  of this process consists partially in plants themselves to survive negative environmental
  conditions. There are two basic different strategies, how to survive these conditions
  – accumulation of heavy metals in plants tissues with different intensity in individual
  cell types, but also organs, which is partially given by chemical composition of
  cell walls, and ability to synthesize special defensive – detoxification compounds
  rich on thiol groups – glutathione and phytochelatins, which are able to bind heavy
  metals and transport them to the “secure” cell compartment – vacuole. The second
  principle is based on ability to exclude heavy metals. Role of secondary metabolites
  rich on sulphur in detoxification of heavy metals is still discussed with unclear
  conclusions. Members of Brassicaceae family, especially genera Thlaspi and Brassica,
  are well-known hyperaccumulators of heavy metals with possible utilization in phytoremediation
  technologies. In this review chapter, mechanisms of cadmium uptake and transport
  and its deposition in various plant cells and tissues are discussed with respect
  with possible utilization in phytoremediation. In addition, role of special sulphur
  metabolites, which are typical for plants of Brassicaceae family – glucosinolates
  – in detoxification of heavy metals is discussed.







































  The mustard family – Brassicaceae – is together with next 15 families classified
  in order Brassicales. Other important families are Capparaceae, which is sometimes
  included in Brassicaceae as subfamily Capparoideae, Tropaeolaceae and Caricaceae,
  which is well known for edible fruits – papaya – with interesting pharmacological
  properties. Brassicaceae consists of usually hermaphroditic herbs, sometimes shrubs,
  with simple lobbed or divided, spiral, exstipulate leaves. Flowers are arranged
  in inflorescence represented usually by a raceme. Flowers are bisexual, usually
  actinomorphic, perianth is dichlamydeous, cruciate. Androecium consists of six stamens,
  Gynoecium is syncarpous, consisting of two carpels. The fruit is a silique or silicle.
  Classification of Brassicaceae family is very complicated, still under the discussion,
  see Table 3.1.

  halleri, Arabidopsis thaliana, Brassica juncea, Thlaspi caerulescens, Thlaspi praecox







  Family has a worldwide distribution. There are many species of economical value,
  for example vegetable plants, plants used for obtaining of dyes, oil, etc. There
  are also many ornamental plants. The best known member of family is Arabidopsis
  thaliana, plant noted as a model for molecular biology. The Brassicaceae contains
  high number of species that are able of hyperaccumulation of heavy metals, especially
  nickel, cadmium and zinc. About 25% of all known hyperaccumulators are members of
  this family.




  Cadmium is soft, bluish-white metal that is chemically similar to zinc and mercury.
  It occurs as a minor component in zinc ores, no cadmium-containing ores are known.
  There is only one exception – greenockite is closely associated with zinc ore sphalerite.
  Cadmium has many industrial applications. It is used in batteries, in electroplating,
  as a barrier to control nuclear fission, for manufacturing of pigments, as stabilizers
  of plastics, etc. Cadmium is in laboratories used for preparation of cadmium-selenide
  quantum dots, which emit luminescence after excitation. Cadmium has no biological
  role in the living organisms. However, marine diatoms contain cadmium-dependent
  enzyme carbonic anhydrase CDCA1, enzyme that catalyses the reversible hydration
  of carbon dioxide. Cadmium performs the same function as zinc in this enzyme. It
  seems that cadmium is involved in function of this enzyme instead zinc ions, which
  may be replaced by cadmium ions. Cadmium is one of the most important contaminants
  of the environment. The steel industry and waste incineration followed by volcanic
  action and zinc production are estimated to account the largest emissions of atmospheric
  cadmium. The main source of soil and water cadmium contamination are especially
  fertilizers, but also pesticides, fungicides, and sewage. Contamination of soil
  and water by cadmium is connected with its uptake by plants – crops and vegetables
  – cultivated for human consumption. Smoking represents one of the most important
  sources of humans’ exposure to cadmium. Numerous studies are focused on the formation
  of organic cadmium compounds by organisms, which are more toxic in comparison with
  inorganic forms, especially dimethyl derivatives. Toxicity of cadmium is known for
  many years. Chronic prolonged oral cadmium indigestion is known in Japan as Itai-Itai
  disease. Human toxic exposure causes damage of kidneys based on kidney tubular damage.
  Cadmium can also damage bones via direct effect on bone tissue and indirect effect
  associated with kidney dysfunction. Just itai-itai disease is connected with damage
  of bones and is characterized by multiple fractures of the long bones in the skeleton.
  Carcinogenicity of cadmium is widely discussed. It has been proposed as a prostate
  and renal carcinogen, however, available data are still controversial. Generation
  of reactive oxygen species, interactions with proteins, and induction of apoptosis
  by cadmium ions have been described in many in vitro studies. Toxicity of cadmium
  on plants includes inhibition of many enzymes involving in disruption of physiological
  processes including photosynthesis and growth alterations.




  Family Brassicaceae contains some members, in which metabolism of heavy metals is
  intensely investigated. Arabidopsis thaliana represents the most important member
  of family and model plant in molecular biology. Cadmium is rapidly absorbed, translocated
  and accumulated in the aerial parts of many plants. Tolerance of heavy metals is
  closely connected to regulation of sulphur uptake. Sulphate transporters are proteins
  involved in sulphate transport across a membrane. Two classes of sulphate transporters
  have been established – low -affinity and high-affinity. They differ not only in
  condition, under they work and in selectivity. Some of them are responsible for
  uptake of not only sulphate, but also chemically similar, but toxic analogues, such
  as selenate. High-affinity sulphate transporters are the best known and characterized
  sulphate transporters. They have been identified especially in model plant Arabidopsis
  thaliana with tissue specificity. Recent works describe newly discovered sulphate
  transporters in different plants. For example, low-affinity sulphate transporter
  BnSultr2;2 together with high-affinity sulphate transporter BnSultr1;1 has been
  identified in Brassica napus. Increased tolerance to cadmium ions based on the efficient
  sulphate uptake and assimilation has been identified. Some genes involved in cadmium
  uptake have been identified. BjCdR15 expression was detected mainly in the epidermis
  and vascular system of cadmium-treated Brassica juncea plants. Further transport
  of cadmium into aerial parts is significantly affected by: interactions with cell
  walls, chelation by thiols, compartmentation into vacuoles. Transport of cadmium
  ions is via cells is closely connected with transporters. In addition, a plenty
  of transporters associated with transport of next heavy metals has been described.
  Cadmium is usually compartmented in vacuoles. However, interaction and deposition
  in cell walls have been described. These findings are in agreement with next published
  data. Cadmium accumulators Arabidopsis halleri, Arabidopsis thaliana, Thlaspi caerulescens,
  Thlaspi praecox and Brassica juncea are intensely studied due to their abilities
  to accumulate cadmium ions. Individual questions are discussed in independent chapters.



  Molecular mechanisms proposed to be involved in transition metal accumulation by
  plants. Metal ions are mobilized by secretion of chelators and by acidification
  of the rhizosphere. Uptake of hydrated metal ions or metal-chelate complexes is
  mediated by various uptake systems residing in the plasma membrane. Inside the cell,
  metals are chelated and excess metal is sequestered by transport into the vacuole.
  From the roots, transition metals are transported to the shoot via the xylem. Presumably,
  the larger portion reaches the xylem via the root symplast. Apoplastic passage might
  occur at the root tip. Inside the xylem, metals are present as hydrated ions or
  as metal-chelate complexes. After reaching the apoplast of the leaf, metals are
  differentially captured by different leaf cell types and move cell-to-cell through
  plasmodesmata. Storage appears to occur preferentially in trichomes. Uptake into
  the leaf cells again is catalysed by various transporters . Intracellular distribution
  of essential transition metals is mediated by specific metallochaperones and transporters
  localized in endomembranes. Abbreviations and symbols: CW cell wall, M metal, filled
  circles chelators, filled ovals transporters, bean-shaped structures metallochaperones




  Arabidopsis thaliana tolerates cadmium concentration of 1 μM in substrate without
  visible signs of the toxicity. However, higher concentrations leads to the visible
  morphological changes including shortening the elongation zone of roots, premature
  xylogenesis, changes in rhizines formation and their premature elimination, and
  changes in formation of lateral roots. Changes in root system are closely connected
  with reduction of aerial parts growth as well as total biomass. However, there are
  significant differences between individual studied members of the Brassicaceae as
  well as between individual ecotypes. Especially reduction of biomass production
  under Cd supplementation represents one of the most important restriction of their
  usage in phytoremediation technologies.


  Cadmium exposure induces expression of about 80–100 genes, which encode especially
  proteinkinases, transcriptional factors, calmodulin-associated proteins, chaperones,
  and protective compounds, such as thiols and antioxidant enzymes, such as catalases,
  ascorbate peroxidases, superoxide dismutases, which are closely connected with cadmium
  detoxification and elimination of reactive oxygen species.


  Arabidopsis thaliana is cadmium excluder. Roots of experimental plants can contain
  up to 89% of cadmium in dependence on experimental conditions. Only a minority of
  cadmium is transported into aerial parts – shoots. Similar results have been obtained
  in related species – Arabidopsis halleri. In this species, roots represent the main
  organs of cadmium accumulation in hyperaccumulating ecotypes. This fact is connected
  with the binding of cadmium ions into cell walls, especially in the lower concentrations.
  The negatively charged carboxyl group of the cell walls provides sites for cation
  exchange leading to the accumulation of positively charged divalent or polyvalent
  cations. Experimental conditions play crucial point in these experiments. Hydroponically
  cultivated Thlaspi coerulescens demonstrate the highest cadmium content in roots,
  however, in soil cultivated plants has only 20% of cadmium in roots, rest of cadmium
  ions is transported into aerial parts. Precipitation of cadmium ions especially
  with phosphorus under formation of insoluble compounds has been demonstrated. Cadmium
  ions at concentration about 5 μM are transported into cortex, where form granular
  deposits in cell walls and intercellular spaces in Arabidopsis thaliana. Granular
  deposits in the cytoplasm are well evident at high concentrations. Deposition of
  cadmium in cell walls and intercellular spaces is connected with disruption of water
  transport within roots. Casparian strips present in endodermis contain significantly
  higher amount of cadmium compared to cell walls of other cells. In addition, granular
  deposits as a result of cadmium treatment are well evident also in vacuoles. Radial
  transport of cadmium ions is connected with formation of granular deposits in pericycle
  and xylem. Higher cadmium content was detected in passage cells, especially in the
  form of cytoplasmic granular deposits.


  In A. thaliana, cadmium is transported from roots in the complexes with phytochelatins.
  On the other hand, transport of cadmium in A. thaliana is bidirectional. High content
  of cadmium in phloem, respectively in cytoplasm of sieve elements and companion
  cells, is a result of translocation of cadmium from aerial parts – shoots. Xylem
  sap of A. hallerii contains cadmium ions in the free form, or in the complexes with
  citrate. In the aerial plant parts, the highest content of cadmium has been found
  in trichomes in A. thaliana. This fact is probably connected with the protection
  of photosynthetically active tissues – leave mesophyll – against toxic effect of
  cadmium ions. In comparison with trichomes, epidermis and leaf mesophyll contain
  undetectable cadmium amount. Only minimal cadmium levels have been detected in vascular
  bundles of leaves, especially in vessel elements. Different situation has been observed
  in A. halleri, whose populations in France may be considered as hyperaccumulators.
  The highest cadmium concentration was detected in the bases of trichomes. Nevertheless,
  treatment of experimental plants by high cadmium concentrations leads to its transport
  into leaf mesophyll vacuoles. Due to fact, that epidermal cells are only weakly
  vacuolated, they contain only minimal Cd concentrations. Different mechanism of
  cadmium accumulation is presented in T. coerulescens, species lacking trichomes,
  which are usual place of this process. The highest cadmium content was detected
  in the big epidermal cells followed by leaf mesophyll. Thirty-five percent of cadmium
  ions is bound in cell walls of epidermal/mesophyll cells. The youngest leaves demonstrate
  the highest accumulation capabilities. Colenchyma cells, which serve as mechanical
  tissue, contain the highest cadmium content in T. praecox leaves.


  Whereas cadmium in roots of experimental A. thaliana plants predominates in insoluble
  form due to formation of precipitates with phosphates under formation of Cd3(PO4)2,
  about 58% of total cadmium in shoots is in water-soluble form. Phosphate precipitates
  represent the main Cd form also in A. halleri. On the other hand, there are significant
  differences between individual members of the Brassicaceae. There are also differences
  between tissues of various onthogenetical ages. However, there is one fundamental
  question – isn’t formation of these precipitates a result of hydroponic cultivation
  of experimental plants? Granular deposits in symplast are formed by cadmium coordinated
  to sulphur, which suppose reaction between cadmium ions and sulphur-containing molecules,
  especially Cd-phytochelatins, Cd-phytochelatins-sulphide and/or Cd-sulphide. High-molecular
  ligands are responsible for cadmium depositions in shoots. 75% of total cadmium
  is in trichomes bound with O and N, probably in pectins and cuticle of cell wall,
  only 25% of cadmium is bound with sulphur, probably with GSH. This fact corresponds
  to increased levels of GSH in trichomes.




  Exposition of A. thaliana to cadmium ions leads to the increased expression of the
  genes for O-acetylserine(thiol)lyase, γ-glutamyl cysteine synthetase and glutathione
  synthetase. All these findings support importance of sulphur compounds in cadmium
  detoxification. Expressions of GS and GCS are increased in the first step after
  cadmium exposition. Product of GCS-γ-glutamylcysteine – represents substrate for
  GSH biosynthesis. These connections have been verified using buthionine sulphoximine.
  Application of this inhibitor of GCS biosynthesis leads to the enhancement of sensitivity
  of Arabidopsis thaliana plants to cadmium ions. Similar results were obtained using
  cad2-1 mutant with altered genes for GCS, which produce only 30–45% of GCS in comparison
  with wild types. External application of GSH does not lead to the increased tolerance
  to cadmium, but it is toxic also for plants without Cd exposition. This fact indicates
  the role of GSH in biosynthesis of phytochelatins. Application of GSH may lead to
  the disruption of oxidation reduction balance in cells due to reduction of GSSG,
  which is formed from GSH in cultivation medium. Role of phytochelatins has been
  investigated using Arabidopsis thaliana cad1-3 mutant with mutation in AtPCS1 gene
  for phytochelatin synthase. Expression of TaPCS1 from Triticum aestivum in roots
  of cad1-3 A. thaliana mutants led to the reduction of Cd accumulation in roots and
  enhancement of Cd transport from roots into shoots. Expression of AtPCS1 is twofold
  increased after Cd application, but only in first 5 days. Activity of AtPCS1 is
  after it regulated only on the enzymatic level. Presence of GSH-Cd is limiting factor
  for PC biosynthesis. However, there are still unanswered questions in the regulation
  of PCs biosynthesis under Cd exposition. On the other hand, overexpression of AtPCS1
  does not increase production of PCs and leads to the increased sensitivity of experimental
  plants to Cd. This fact may be connected with disruption of metals homeostasis,
  toxicity of PCs excess or depletion of GSH. Enhanced expression of AtMT2a and AtMT3
  for metallothioneins like proteins after Cd exposition is connected with increased
  tolerance of plants to Cd. Expression of these genes in stomatal cells of Vicia
  faba increased their tolerance to Cd under reduction of ROS formation. MTLs are
  localised in cytoplasm, they are not translocated into vacuoles after Cd exposition
  in comparison with PCs. In addition, protective effect of MTLs is based on their
  antioxidant properties. This fact has been confirmed in experiments with hydrogen
  peroxide as a generator of ROS. Transporters of metals of the transport ATPase group
  – AtHMA2, AtHMA3 and AtHMA4 plays important role in complexation of heavy metals
  in cells. Heterological expression of AtHMA3 in ycf1 yeast mutants has confirmed
  role of this transporter in vacuolar sequestration of cadmium ions. Differences
  in the expression of AtHMA2, AtHMA3 and AtHMA4 are indicative to their different
  roles. AtHMA2 and AtHMA4 are localised in plasmalemma, whereas AtHMA3 in tonoplast,
  so, it is well evident that AtHMA3 is involved in sequestration of toxic heavy metal
  ions into vacuoles. Highest AtHMA2, AtHMA4 and AtHMA3 expression was detected in
  the cells of root stele and in root vascular tissue as well as in stomatal cells
  and cells of hydatodes. All these cells are in the first contact with heavy metals
  ions – roots with soil/water and stomata and hydatodes with air polluted by heavy
  metals. In addition, these tissues are essential for maintenance of physiological
  functions, so, detoxification of heavy metals in these tissues is fundamental. AtHMA2
  and AtHMA4, which main functions consist in transport of zinc ions to the xylem,
  have significant affinity to cadmium ions and are able to execute their translocation
  from roots to shoots. These fact have been confirmed using mutants hma4, and hma2
  hma4. HMA2 and HMA4 represent the main mechanism of Cd transport to the xylem. However,
  in comparison of hma2 hma4 and cad1 mutants, sensitivity of cad1 mutant to cadmium
  ions is 10–20-fold higher.


  AtNRAMP1, AtNRAMP3 and AtNRAMP4 are the next transporters associated with cadmium
  transport. AtNRAMP1, AtNRAMP3 and AtNRAMP4 are expressed in both roots and shoots.
  Expression of AtNRAMP3 and AtNRAMP4 is induced by iron deficiency; it means that
  their primary function consists in Fe transport. AtNRAMP3 knock-out does not lead
  to the reduction of iron absorption, but to the increase of tolerance of mutants
  to cadmium ions. Its overexpression is connected with increased sensitivity of plants
  to the Cd. In conclusion, AtNRAMP3 is able to transport both Fe and Cd ions, which
  means that its function consists in iron absorption under presence of Cd, which
  inhibits other Fe transporters. A. thaliana genome contains ten AtPCR genes, which
  are connected with cadmium resistance. AtPCR1 and AtPCR2 expression is induced by
  Cd exposition. Their expression is not connected with GSH. This fact has been verified
  by BSO application.


  PDR transporters play important role in host-pathogen interactions, enhanced expression
  of some PDR has been recorded under different stress conditions. AtPDR8 is up-regulated
  at Cd and Pb exposition. Knockout or silencing of AtPDR8 increases sensitivity of
  experimental plants to Cd, on the other hand, its overexpression reduces amount
  of accumulated Cd in plants and reduce rate of Cd absorption by individual protoplasts.
  AtPDR8 serves as a pump for transport of Cd ions out of cells. Mutation of gene
  CDR3 – cdr3-1D – leads to the enhancement of tolerance of mutants to Cd, Pb, Cu,
  H2O2, and to the reduction of Cd and Pb accumulation. Cdr3-1D mutant has increased
  expression of AtPDR8/AtPDR12, AtPCR1 and GSH1 and increased levels of GSH. CDR3
  is responsible for regulation of above-mentioned genes. All transporters found in
  A. thaliana are summarized in Table 3.2. In addition, their comparison with next
  Brassicaceae species is presented.





  Nitric oxide, important signal molecule, plays crucial role in Cd metabolism in
  plants. Exposition of plants to cadmium ions leads to the enhancement of NO production
  in both roots and leaves. On the other hand, supplementation of plants by NO scavengers
  cPITO and/or l-NAME causes reduction of Cd accumulation in roots under reduction
  of inhibition of root growth. Nevertheless, cadmium accumulation in aerial parts
  – shoots – is not altered. All these facts mean that NO is responsible for inhibition
  of root growth. In addition, NO modulates functions of calcium channels and pumps,
  because application of NO scavengers does not lead to the reduction of calcium content
  in roots after cadmium exposition in comparison with NO-scavengers untreated plants.




  Sulphur belongs to the group of the most important essential nutrients in organisms.
  In plants, sulphur is taken up especially in the form of inorganic sulphate. After
  reduction, sulphur is incorporated into cysteine in the processes of primary sulphate
  assimilation. Cysteine serves as a sulphur donor for biosynthesis of both methionine,
  the major sulphur containing amino acid in plants and precursor of glucosinolates
  biosynthesis, and glutathione, the most important protective non-protein thiol compound.
  Glucosinolates, mustard oil glycosides, represent one of the bioactive sulphur-containing
  secondary metabolites in plants, which occur almost only in members of order Brassicales.
  However, these compounds have been identified in some plants of Euphorbiaceae family.
  More than 120 glucosinolated have been identified in the Brassicaceae. Some of them
  and their degradation products, such as sulphoraphane, crambene and indole-3-carbinol,
  are in the centre of interest due to their chemoprotective effect, especially in
  connection with malignant diseases. Their structure is based on ά-D-glucopyranose
  residue, which is linked via a sulphur atom to a-N-hydroximinosulphate ester. Basic
  structure is modified by variable R group, which is derived from some amino acids.
  In addition, it seems that sulphur in the glucosinolate structure may be replaced
  by similar selenium under selenoglucosinolates formation. However, these compounds
  are still discussed. Glucosinolates are derived from a limited group of amino acids,
  including alanine, leucine, methionine, phenylalanine and tryptophan. Their biosynthesis
  may be divided into three phases: elongation of amino acid chain, in which methylene
  groups are inserted into the side chain, conversion of the amino acid moiety to
  the glucosinolate structure, and modification of the side chain – oxidation, hydroxylation,
  or esterification. However, their biosynthesis is still under the discussion Glucosinolates
  are stored in the vacuoles. After damage of plant tissue and consecutive exposure
  to myrosinases, ά-thioglucoside glucosidases, they are hydrolysed to isothiocyanates
  and other products of toxicological importance, such as nitriles and thiocyanates.
  Formation of next product is connected with protein factors called specifier proteins,
  which are able to promote formation of alternative products on the dependence on
  the glucosinolate side chain structure. Glucosinolates as well as the products of
  their hydrolysis are connected with the protection against herbivores and pathogens.
  Glucosinolates as well as product of their hydrolysis induce GST activity in some
  insect, such as Myzus persicae feeding Brassica napus and next members of the Brassicaceae.
  Defensive role for indole glucosinolates is suggested by the observation that atr1D
  mutant A. thaliana plants, which overproduce indole glucosinolates, are more resistant
  to M. persicae, whereas cyp79B2/cyp79B3 A. thaliana double mutants that lack indole
  glucosinolates, succumb to M. persicae more rapidly. Indole glucosinolate breakdown
  products, including conjugates formed with ascorbate, glutathione and amino acids,
  are elevated in the honeydew of M. persicae feeding from atr1D mutant plants, but
  are absent when the aphids are feeding on cyp79B2 cyp79B3 double mutants.



  Biosynthesis of thiols and glucosinolates. APS adenosine 5′-phosphosulfate, ATP
  adenosine triphosphate


  On the other hand, response of A. thaliana to herbivore includes activation of genes
  involved in oxidative stress, calcium-dependent signalling and pathogenesis-related
  responses. Glutathione S-transferases are mainly cytosolic enzymes that catalyse
  the conjugation of electrophile molecules with reduced glutathione under formation
  of less toxic products. Enhanced GST activity was demonstrated in Episyrphus balteatus,
  and Brevicoryne brassicae. Isothiocyanates as degradation product of glucosinolates
  were detected in cabbage aphid. Nevertheless, this chapter is not focused on biochemistry
  of glucosinolates and characterization of their breakdown product. For additional
  information, see published articles.


  In plants, toxic substances become more water soluble and they can subsequently
  be stored in vacuoles. Compartmentation in vacuoles plays important role in detoxification
  of many compounds. Tripeptide glutathione as well as phytochelatins as glutathione
  oligomers play crucial role in detoxification of heavy metal ions and xenobiotics
  in plants. Cysteine moiety/moieties with sulfhydryl groups, which serves as a proton
  donor, plays essential role in their function.


  Glutathione is synthesized from the amino acids L-cysteine, L-glutamic acid and
  L-glycine. In the first step, γ-glutamylcysteine is synthesized from L-glutamine
  and L-cysteine via the enzyme γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase, in the second step,
  glycine is added to the C-terminal of γ-glutamylcysteine under glutathione formation.
  This reaction is catalysed by glutathione synthetase. Phytochelatins are synthesized
  via phytochelatin synthases activity. There are many questions in the connection
  between glutathione and phytochelatins and glucosinolates. However, this relationship
  can be expected. Treatment of A. thaliana by cadmium ions led to the decrease of
  a content of total glucosinolates, especially indole glucosinolates. Similar results
  have been obtained in Thlaspi praecox and T. arvense. In the case of cadmium-sensitive
  T. arvense, its application led to the shift from alkenyl glucosinolates to indolyl
  glucosinolates. Treatment of the second species, T. praecox, by cadmium led to the
  increase of total glucosinolates, especially benzyl glucosinolate sinalbin. Connection
  between glucosinolates biosynthesis, zinc accumulation and organ specificity was
  demonstrated on T. coerulescens in the study of Tolra et al.. Whereas zinc treatment
  led to the decrease of glucosinolate sinalbin in shoots, its concentrations increased
  with zinc accumulation. Changes in sinalbin were the most significant, other glucosinolates
  remained almost unaltered. Only week decrease of indolyl glucosinolates in both
  shoots and roots and 3-butenylglucosinolate in the roots was observed. There are
  two fundamental questions. Where is a source of sulphur in glucosinolate biosynthesis?
  Firstly, differences have been observed in the processes of sulphur assimilation.
  Adenosine 5′-phosphosulphate kinase limits the availability of sulphur for biosynthesis
  of sulphur-containing secondary metabolites. Reduction of its activity leads to
  the reduction of glucosinolates biosynthesis and increase of thiol compounds formation
  in A. thaliana. Overexpression of enzyme APS reductase has no effect on glucosinolates
  production, but increases production of thiol compounds. However, the source of
  reduced sulphur atom in the core glucosinolate structure remains unknown. Recent
  evidences show the possible role of glutathione in this process. Work of Geu-Flores
  shows role of GSH as a sulphur donor in glucosinolates biosynthesis. The A. thaliana
  pad2-1 mutant is connected with reduced levels of glucosinolates, respectively camalexin.
  PAD2 gene encodes a g-glutamylcysteine synthetase that is involved in glutathione
  biosynthesis, so, pad2-1 mutant contains only 20% of the GSH in comparison with
  wild plants. Reduced GSH levels correlate with reduction of accumulation of the
  two major glucosinolates in A. thaliana – indolyl-3-methyl-glucosinolate and 4-methylsulfinylbutyl-glucosinolate.
  All these data suggest participation of GSH in glucosinolate biosynthesis and close
  connection between metabolism of thiol compounds and glucosinolates. The second
  question consists in involvement of enzymes connected with thiol biosynthesis in
  the biosynthesis of glucosinolates. Experiments with A. thaliana mutants impaired
  in the production of the γ-glutamyl peptidases GGP1 and GGP3 have demonstrated altered
  biosynthesis of glucosinolates. GGPs catalyse transfer of γ-glutamyl functional
  groups of glutathione to acceptors. These peptidases have been found in many plant
  species and are connected with many physiological processes in plants, including
  ripening of seeds/fruits and degradation of some biomolecules. Function of known
  cytosolic γ-glutamyl peptidases in the processes of formation of GSH conjugates
  has been demonstrated in A. thaliana plants. Role of GG1 was investigated in benzylglucosinolate-producing
  non-cruciferous plant Nicotiana benthamiana. In this study, increased levels of
  benzylglucosinolate in the presence of GGP1 were accompanied by the high accumulation
  of the last intermediate desulfobenzylglucosinolate. This fact suggest role of sufotransferase
  AtSOT16 in the formation of terminal product – benzylglucosinolate. Role of PCS
  in glucosinolate biosynthesis is widely discussed. It seems that PCS serve as a
  peptidase in indole glucosinolate biosynthesis in A. thaliana. Glucosinolate-derived
  molecules seem to be the most likely candidates as PCS substrates in A. thaliana.
  All these data suggest role of PCS not only in homeostasis of heavy metals, but
  also their regulatory role in glucosinolates biosynthesis.






  There are different strategies in enhancement of accumulation properties of members
  of the Brassicaceae. The first approach consists in supplementation of soil by additives,
  compounds that are able to increase uptake of heavy metals including cadmium. There
  are many compounds, which were tested of possible chelators of heavy metals. However,
  their usage has many disadvantages including potential toxicity with reduction of
  biomass production and hazard for the environment due to mobilization of heavy metals.
  On the other hand, heavy-metals accumulating plants may represent potential risk
  because of their possible entry the food chain. All these questions must be carefully
  considered. Chelators in the phytoremediation by the Brassicaceae are summarized
  in Table 3.3.





  In the Brassicaceae, effect of two different compounds on cadmium uptake – nitrilotriacetate
  and citric acid – by Indian mustard were investigated in the study of Quartacci
  et al.. NTA-treated plants demonstrated twofold increase of cadmium accumulation
  compared to control plants. EDTA, EDDS and histidine as potential chelators of Cu,
  Pb, Fe and Zn for Brassica juncea uptake were used in experiments of Karczewska
  et al.. Synthetic aminopolycarboxylic acids ethylenediamine tetracarboxylic acid
  and diethylenetriamin pentaacetate together with low-molecular organic acids oxalic
  acid and citric acid were used in experiments with Brassica juncea cultivated in
  serpentine-mine tailings contaminated by Cr and Ni. Authors declare advantages of
  the use of low-molecular organic acids as chelators due to reduction of environmental
  risk in phytoremediation. However, further data are still missing.


  The second approach is based on construction of transgenic plants. This method is
  based on an introducing of foreign genes, which are connected with uptake, transport
  and accumulation of heavy metal/metals. A yeast cadmium factor 1, a member of the
  ATP-binding cassette transporters, is localised at the vacuolar membrane in Saccharomyces
  cerevisiae. YCF1 gene introduced to the transgenic Brassica juncea plants showed
  1.3- to 1.6-fold tolerance to cadmium ions compared to wild plants. Overexpression
  of BjCdR15 in transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana and Nicotiana tabacum led to the enhancement
  of cadmium tolerance. Arabidopsis tga3-2 mutants demonstrated high cadmium accumulation
  in roots and inhibition of its transport into aerial parts. Possibilities of different
  approaches including genetic manipulations for improvement of heavy metals tolerance
  and accumulation are summarized in reviews.




  An ideal plant for phytoremediation should meet several criteria: to grow rapidly
  and to produce large quantities of biomass, to deeply root and to have an easily
  harvested shoots, and to accumulate high concentrations of contaminants in the shoots.
  Presently known hyperaccumulators of metals, in other words plants capable of over-accumulation
  metals in their tissues, meet the third criterion of an ideal plant for phytoremediation
  as Brassicaceae. In contrast, there other plants as crops meet the first two criteria
  of an ideal plant for phytoremediation. The combination of these properties by some
  genetic manipulation could be very promising for the future of remediation of polluted
