  and the antioxidant properties of watercress produced under organic production system.
  Fresh baby-leaf watercress samples were collected from local organic farms. High
  performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection and high performance
  liquid chromatography with diode array detection mass spectrometry were used to
  assess the phytochemical composition, and spectrophotometric methods were used to
  assess the antioxidant capacity. Two major classes of healthier secondary plant
  metabolites were identified: phenolics and glucosinolates. The major phenolics determined
  were chlorogenic acid, quercetin-3-O-rutinoside, dicaffeoyltartaric acid, and isorhamnetin.
  The glucosinolates were composed exclusively of gluconasturtiin, the precursor of
  the anticarcinogenic, and antimicrobial compound 2-phenylethyl isothiocyanate. The
  extracts of organic young baby-leaf watercress presented high antioxidant capacity
  and this property was highly related with caffeic acid, quercetin-3-O-rutinoside,
  isorhamnetin, and glucosnastrutiin. The results achieved showed that baby-leaf watercress
  can provide high contents of antioxidant compounds at levels even superior to similar
  adult plant material.\n\nEl objetivo de este estudio fue evaluar la composición
  fitoquímica y propiedades antioxidantes de berros producidos bajo el sistema de
  producción ecológico. Muestras frescas de hojas tiernas de berros se recolectaron
  en granjas ecológicas locales. HPLC-DAD y HPLC-MS fueron utilizados para evaluar
  la composición fitoquímica y métodos espectrofotométricos se utilizaron para evaluar
  la capacidad antioxidante. Se identificaron dos clases principales de metabolitos
  secundarios saludables de las plantas, compuestos fenólicos y glucosinolatos. Los
  principales compuestos fenólicos determinadas fueron: ácido clorogénico, quercetina-3-O-rutinósido,
  ácido dicafeoil tartárico y isoramnetina. Los glucosinolatos fueron compuestas exclusivamente
  por gluconasturtina, el precursor del compuesto anti-cancerígenos y antimicrobiana
  isotiocianato de 2-feniletilo. Los extractos de brotes jóvenes de berros ecológicos
  presentaron una alta capacidad antioxidante y esta propiedad fue muy relacionadas
  con el ácido cafeico, la quercetina-3-O-rutinósido, isorhamnetina y glucosnastrutiina.
  Los resultados obtenidos mostraron que los brotes de berro puede proporcionar un
  alto contenido de compuestos antioxidantes a niveles aún superiores del material
  similar de la planta adulta.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe aim of this

  Watercress belongs to the family of Brassicaceae and is regarded in some regions
  as a weed or aquatic vegetable. It is a hardy perennial native to Europe and America,
  sold as fresh and consumed in salads and soups. Like other Brassicacea vegetables,
  the watercress is rich in glucosinolates, a class of sulfur and nitrogen organic
  compounds, which are enzymatically broken down via myrosinase after tissue disruption
  into numerous biologically active products such as isothiocyanates, nitriles, and
  thiocyanates (Bones &amp; Rossiter, 20063\\.  Bones , A. M. and Rossiter , J. T.
  2006. The enzymatic and chemically induced decomposition of glucosinolates. Phytochemistry,
  67: 1053–1067.   \nView all references). The breakdown products of certain GSs,
  particularly the ITCs, have been shown to protect against lung, colon, liver, stomach
  cancers, and redox stress (Lam et al., 200919\\.  Lam , T. K. , Gallicchio , L.
  , Lindsley , K. , Shiels , M. , Hammond , E. , Tao , X. G. , Chen , L. , Robinson
  , K. A. , Caulfield , L. E. and Herman , J. G. 2009. Cruciferous vegetable consumption
  and lung cancer risk: A systematic review. Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers &amp;
  Prevention, 18: 184–195.   \nView all references). Over the past 20 years, it has
  been shown that many classes of phytochemicals are important in the diet and could
  be used as potential therapeutic tools (Johnson, 200716\\.  Johnson , I. T. 2007.
  Phytochemicals and cancer. Proceedings of the Nutrition Society, 66: 207–215.   \nView
  all references). However, the scientific investigation on the therapeutic use of
  watercress and other brassicas is often limited to primary nutrients, GSs, ITCs,
  and their role as antimutagenic, antigenotoxic, antiproliferative, and antitumoral
  agents (Boyd et al., 20064\\.  Boyd , L. A. , McCann , M. J. , Hashim , Y. , Bennett
  , R. N. , Gill , C. I. R. and Rowland , I. R. 2006. Assessment of the anti-genotoxic,
  anti-proliferative, and anti-metastatic potential of crude watercress extract in
  human colon cancer cells. Nutrition and Cancer, 55: 232–241.   \nView all references).
  Fewer reports have been published about their richness on phenolic acids, flavonoids,
  and antioxidant activity.\n\nThe studies of antioxidant activity are frequently
  limited to the total phenolics and total flavonoids, and the influence of individual
  phenolics on antioxidant activity if often forgotten in most studies of chemical
  composition and antioxidant activity. Also, the majority of the studies are about
  plants produced under conventional farming, fewer about low input production, and
  less about organic production, particularly of baby-leaf salads.\n\nThe preference
  for organic products is increasing all over Europe, due to the supposed absence
  of chemical contaminants within this mode of production. Despite this growing interest
  in organic production, there is insufficient information to state categorically
  that organic produce is better than conventional one. Among consumers, doubts still
  persist. Thus, studies that can evaluate the growing conditions on levels of nutrients
  and secondary metabolites are urgently required.\n\nIn view of the foregoing and
  importance of phenolics and GSs as antioxidants in baby-leaf watercress, the present
  study has been undertaken to identify the phytochemical composition and the antioxidant
  properties of fresh baby-leaf watercress produced under organic practices. We intend
  to increment the knowledge and discuss the chemical composition on secondary metabolites
  of organic baby-leaf watercress and discuss its potential as a source of bioactive
  compounds with beneficial effects in human health.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSamples of young
  baby-leaf watercress were acquired directly from organic local farmers in Northern
  Region of Portugal. After purchase, the samples were transported to the Phytochemicals
  Laboratory of the University of Trás-os-Montes e Alto Douro and freeze-dried, ground
  to a fine powder using a blender, and weighed. The dry matter was determined. Then
  0.5 g of powdered sample was then extracted with 10 mL of 700 mL L−1 methanol:water
  and heated at 70°C for 30 minutes, agitated every 5 minutes. All extracts were centrifuged
  at 4000 rpm for 10 minutes, filtered, and dried in a rotary evaporator at 40°C until
  completely dried and kept in –20°C until use in biological assays. Methanolic extracts
  were used to quantify the total and individual phenolics and total flavonoids, and
  to evaluate the antioxidant activity. For individual and total GSs, the extraction
  procedure was different.\n\n\n\nThe quantification of individual phenolics was performed
  by high performance liquid chromatography analysis, using a HPLC-mass spectrometry
  system equipped with diode array detector and reverse phase column. After sample
  preparation, 200 µL of each diluted extracts were added to HCl in 500 mL L−1 methanol,
  and tert-butylhydroquinone were placed in heater at 80°C for 2 hours and then centrifuged
  at 15,493 g for 20 minutes. After this, the supernatant was removed and stored at
  –80°C until its introduction in HPLC system. The eluent was constituted by water
  with 1 mL L−1(v/v) of trifluoroacetic acid and acetonitrile with 100 mL L−1 TFA.
  The TFA sharpens peaks and improves resolution. The TFA has low absorption within
  detection wavelengths, allows sensitive, nondestructive compounds detection at low
  UV wavelengths in HPLC separation systems. Elution was performed at a flow rate
  of solvent of 1 mL min−1, with a gradient starting with 100% of solvent A, and the
  injection volume of 10 μL. The identification was made comparing external standards,
  their retention times, and UV spectra. The LC-MS was used to confirm the results.
  The chromatograms were recorded at 270, 280, 320, and 370 nm for phenolics in general
  and more specifically 520 nm for anthocyanins.\n\n\n\nTotal phenolic content was
  determined using Folin–Ciocalteu reagent and gallic acid as standard (Hakala, Lapvetelainen,
  Huopalahti, Kallio, &amp; Tahvonen, 20039\\.  Hakala , M. , Lapvetelainen , A. ,
  Huopalahti , R. , Kallio , H. and Tahvonen , R. 2003. Effects of varieties and cultivation
  conditions on the composition of strawberries. Journal of Food Composition and Analysis,
  16: 67–80.   \nView all references) with some modifications. In brief, 50 µL of
  extract or commercial standard were mixed with 2.5 mL of Folin &amp; Ciocalteus
  solution and 2 mL of Na2CO3 solution 75 mL L−1. After 15 minutes in the dark at
  45°C temperature, absorbance was measured at 765 nm. Standard gallic solutions were
  also assayed and calibration curve was obtained from the equation: y = 5.703x \\+
  0.089; R 2 = 0.996. A blank assay was also prepared. The phenolic contents were
  expressed as mg gallic acid equivalent kg−1 dry weight.\n\n\n\nTotal flavonoid determinations
  were made using colorimetric assays (Javanmardi, Stushnoff, Locke, &amp; Vivanco,
  200315\\.  Javanmardi , J. , Stushnoff , C. , Locke , E. and Vivanco , J. M. 2003.

  Chemistry, 83: 547–550.   \nView all references) with small modifications. It was
  prepared a mixture of 1 mL of diluted extracts, 4 mL of bi-distilled water, and
  0.3 mL of NaNO2 solution 5%. After shaking and 5 minutes at room temperature, 0.3
  mL of AlCl3 solution 10 mg/100 mL was added and allowed to stand for 6 minutes.
  After this, 2 mL of 1 M NaOH was added. Finally, volume was complete to 10 mL with
  bi-distilled water and thoroughly mixed. The absorbance of the pink mixture was
  measured at 510 nm. Standard catechin solutions were also assayed and calibration
  curve was obtained from the equation: y = 0.029x \\+ 0.188; R 2 = 0.993. A blank
  assay was also prepared. Total flavonoid contents were expressed as mg catechin
  equivalent kg−1 dw. TFC determinations were made in triplicate.\n\n\n\nFor individual
  and total GSs, the extraction procedure was made using the following methodology.
  Briefly, 0.2 g dw sample was extracted with boiling methanol, 3 mL) for 2 minutes.
  A solution of benzyl GLS 50 mg/100 mL L−1 was used as internal standard. After re-extraction
  with boiling 700 mL L−1 methanol:water, the supernatant were combined to a final
  volume of 10 mL. An aliquot was evaporated to dry completely and re-suspended in
  water, and 2 mL L−1 was applied to a small column of DEAE Sephadex A25. The desulpho-GSs
  were obtained using commercial aryl sulfatase Type H1 from Helix pomatia at 14.6
  units · g−1. The desulpho-GSs were eluted with water and analyzed using HPLC. The
  procedure adopted corresponds to the ISO 9167–1 method.\n\nThe quantification of
  individual GSs was also performed by HPLC analysis. GSs peak identification and
  quantitative estimations were made using pure standard GSs as internal standard.
  GSs concentrations were expressed in μmol g−1 dw. All reagents were analytical or
  HPLC grade. The mobile phase consisted of two solvents A and B, being solvent A
  composed of ultra-pure water and solvent B by acetonitrile at 200 mL L−1 acetonitril:water.
  Elution was performed with a flow rate of 1.5 mL minutes−1. The chromatograms were
  recorded at 229 nm and used to identify GSs. The GSs were quantified with the following
  formula: μmol of GS/100 g dw = AG/Api × FR × Cpi × 100 DW. GSs were expressed as
  μmol 100 g−1 dw, in which GS refers to GSs, AG refers to peak area of each GS to
  quantify, Api refers to peak area of the internal standard, FR refers to response
  factor of each GSs identified, Cpi refers to the concentration of the internal standard,
  and DW refers to dw of sample used in the extraction.\n\n\n\n2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl
  free radical scavenging activity was determined using a spectrophotometer according
  to the method described previously leaves. Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry,
  51: 2144–2155.   \nView all references) with small modifications. Briefly, stock
  solutions of crude extracts were prepared as 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 1.25, 2.5, 5.0, and
  10 mg mL−1. Antioxidant activity was measured using 300 µL of each hydrophilic extract
  and 2.7 mL of DPPH solution, 950 mL L−1 in ethanol: water, followed by agitation
  and reaction in dark at room temperature for 60 minutes. Absorbance values were
  measured at 517 nm. A blank assay, using 700 mL L−1 methanol:water, was also prepared.
  A positive control was made with standard solution Trolox in same concentrations
  than hydrophilic extract. The EC50, half maximal effective concentration, values
  were calculated based on a dose–response curve, where abscissa was concentration
  of plant sample extracts and ordinate was the average inhibition percentage. The
  experiment was carried out in triplicate.\n\n\nThe Absblank is the control reaction
  absorbance and Abssample is the absorbance with the extract or standard solution.\n\n\n\nThe
  reducing power of plant extracts was determined using the method described by Hinneburg,
  Dorman, and Hiltunen (200612\\.  Hinneburg , I. , Dorman , H. J. D. and Hiltunen
  , R. 2006. Antioxidant activities of extracts from selected culinary herbs and spices.
  Food Chemistry, 97: 122–129.   \nView all references) with several modifications.
  Serial dilution of the extract was performed in 2.5 mL of 0.2 M sodium phosphate
  buffer containing 2.5 mL 1% aqueous hexacyanoferrate  solution. The mixture was
  incubated at 50°C for 30 minutes. After, 2.5 mL of 100 mL L−1% trichloroacetic acid:water
  was added, and the mixture was mixed thoroughly in a vortex and centrifuged at 3000
  rpm for 10 minutes. The supernatant was collected, mixed with distilled water and
  0.5 mL of 10 mL L−1 ferric chloride was added. The absorbance of this mixture was
  measured at 700 nm. The intensity in absorbance is the measurement of antioxidant
  activity of the extract.\n\n\n\nFerric ion reducing antioxidant power is based on
  the ability of antioxidants to reduce Fe3+ to Fe2+ in the presence of 2,4,6-tri(2-pyridyl)-s-triazine,
  forming an intense blue Fe2+-TPTZ complex with an absorption maximum at 593 nm.
  The FRAP method used was based on a previous study (Stratil, Klejdus, &amp; Kubán,
  200625\\.  Stratil , P. , Klejdus , B. and Kubán , V. 2006. Determination of total
  content of phenolic compounds and their antioxidant activity in vegetables-evaluation
  of spectrophotometric methods. Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, 54: 607–616.
  \  \nView all references) with small modifications. Briefly, the FRAP reagent was
  prepared from sodium acetate buffer, 10 mM TPTZ solution, and 20 mM iron chloride
  solution in a volume ratio of 10:1:1, respectively. The FRAP reagent was prepared
  freshly and warmed at 37 °C in a water bath before use. One hundred microliters
  of the diluted extracts was added to 3 mL of the FRAP reagent. The absorbance of
  the reaction mixture was then detected at 593 nm after 4 minutes in room temperature.
  The standard curve was constructed using FeSO4 solution, and the results were expressed
  as μmol Fe(II) g−1 dw of plant material. Also, the EC50 values were calculated based
  on a dose–response curve. The experiment was carried out in triplicate.\n\n\n\nSPPS
  for windows version 17.0 was used for statistical analysis. All experiments were
  performed in triplicate and the results were presented as the mean ± SEM. The data
  were analyzed using one-way ANOVA. The differences between the mean values were
  separated using Duncan test, at significance level of P ; 0.05. Also a primary component
  analysis and a Pearson correlation between phytochemicals content and antioxidant
  activity of organic baby-leaf watercress extracts were carried out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe
  phytochemical composition of organic baby-leaf watercress was measured and results

  \  \nView all references), the organic baby-leaf watercress presented high average
  levels of TPC and TFC representing between 1 and 2 times more than the values obtained
  by theses authors. The TFC represented 40% of the TPC. The major individual phenolics
  identified by HPLC were gallic acid, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, quercetin-3-O-rutinoside,
  dicaffeoyltartaric acid, and isorhamnetin. The phenolics quercetin-3-O-rutinoside
  and isorhamnetin represented 79% of the total individual phenolics identified, which
  is important since these two flavonoids are often associated with the decrease of
  imflammatory and cardiovascular risk and frequently reported as antagonizing agents

  watercress presented higher diversity and levels of phytochemicals, which means
  that this type of plant material is a good natural source of antioxidants compounds,
  particularly quercetin-3-O-rutinoside, a potent antioxidant compound. Thus, there
  is an advantage in consuming watercress as fresh and in a young physiological stage
  of development.\n\nFor the GSs, these were exclusively composed of the GS 2-phenylethyl,
  normally known as gluconasturtiin, the most typical GS of this type of Cruciferae

  as a source of gluconasturtiin.\n\nBased on these results, it seems that organic
  baby-leaf watercress is a biological sample with an important richness in phytochemicals,
  with potential positives effect on human health. Thus, their consumption must be
  increased either in salads or in soups.\n\n\n\nIn Table 2, our results showed an
  effective antioxidant and antiradical activity which varied with concentration tested.
  The percentage of scavenging radicals of DPPH from 1 mg mL−1 showed high antiradical
  activity compared to the positive control. The scavenging effect of organic baby-leaf
  watercress and commercial standards on the DPPH radical increased with concentration.
  The effect of antioxidants on DPPH radical scavenging is thought to be due to their
  hydrogen donating ability. DPPH is a stable free radical and accepts an electron
  or hydrogen radical to become a stable diamagnetic molecule. The model of scavenging
  the stable DPPH is a widely used method to evaluate antioxidant activities compared
  to other methods (Gülçin, 20128\\.  Gülçin , I. 2012. Antioxidant activity of food
  constituents: An overview. Archives of Toxicology, 86: 345–391.   \nView all references).
  These results show that watercress is a free radical inhibitor, as well as an antioxidant
  that reacts with free radicals. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2. HPLC chromatogram

  of organic baby-leaf watercress have strong antioxidant activity in reducing power
  method. The reducing power capacities of samples of watercress compared to Trolox
  are presented in Table 2 and Figure 4. As the same for percentage of scavenging
  radicals of DPPH by watercress hydrophilic extracts, the antioxidant activity measured
  by reducing power method was similar to positive control. Both varied with concentration
  tested. With the FRAP method, the antioxidant activity detected at 1 mg mL−1 of
  watercress extracts was very different and was much lower than the antioxidant activity
  detected for the positive control.We think that this method is not the most adequate
  to measure the antioxidant activity in this type of plant matrixes. Initially designed
  to determine the antioxidant activity of plasma, it was also been applied to other
  substrates; however, it seems not to have the same sensitivity, as we noted in the
  current study. Nevertheless, the same tendency was noted, e.g., the antioxidant
  activity increased with the extract concentration. From the results obtained here
  and from results reported recently by other authors for adult watercress samples
  and other vegetables from conventional agricultural system including other baby-leaf
  vegetables (Gülçin, I., 20128\\.  Gülçin , I. 2012. Antioxidant activity of food

  that organic baby-leaf watercress extracts have higher in vitro antiradical and
  antioxidant capacity, which seems to be related with higher levels of phytochemicals.\n\n\n\nThe
  antioxidant activity of fruits and vegetables has been related with the presence
  of bioactive compounds such as vitamins, polyphenolic compounds, and other compounds
  such β-carotene, tocopherol, and pigments, which have been considered to be a major
  dietary factor responsible for such protective effects (Shahidi, Liyana-Pathirana,

  2006. Antioxidant activity of white and black sesame seeds and their hull fractions.
  Food Chemistry, 99: 478–483.   \n\nTo analyze this potential relation, a correlation
  analysis and a PCA were carried out between phytochemicals content and antioxidant
  activity of organic baby-leaf watercress extracts. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure

  Pearson correlation showed positive and significant correlation between antioxidant
  activity and the individual phytochemicals caffeic acid, quercetin-3-O-rutinoside,
  isorhamnetin, and gluconasturtiin. Similar results were achieved with the PCA. The
  PCA analysis reveals that the antioxidant activity of watercress measured by three
  different methods was always explained by the presence of certain phytochemicals.
  The Figure 6 shows the graphic representation of the relation between the antioxidant
  activity, measured by the three methods and the concentration of phytochemicals.
  For DPPH method, the antioxidant activity was explained by the presence of caffeic
  acid, quercetin-3-O-rutinoside, gluconasturtiin, and isorhamnetin. Whilst for reducing
  power assay and FRAP method, the values for antioxidant activity were explained
  by the presence of caffeic acid, quercetin-3-O-rutinoside, and gluconasturtiin.
  These three methods had in common the presence of caffeic acid, quercetin-3-O-rutinoside,
  and gluconasturtiin as the phytochemicals with higher relations with antioxidant
  activity. Thus, organic baby-leaf watercress seems to have high antioxidant activity
  due to the presence of caffeic acid, quercetin-3-O-rutinoside, and gluconasturtiin.\n\nThese
  results confirms the role of caffeic acid, quercetin-3-O-rutinoside, and gluconasturtiin
  as antioxidant compounds in watercress. The direct association between the levels
  of caffeic acid, querctin-3-O-rutinoside and antioxidant activity is not a surprise
  since other authors had reported it but for other food matrices. However this is
  the first report for gluconasturtiin, to our knowledge. No correlations between
  TPC and TFC were found, probably due to the nonselective effect of analytical methods
  used for their determination. The spectrophotometric methods used could extract
  other components than phenolics and flavonoids which can interfere with the measurement
  of antioxidant activity. Thus, the HPLC methods are always preferable to determine
  the accurate levels of phenolics, GSs, and other phytochemicals than the spectrophotometric
  methods.\n\nBased on our results, it seems that watercress could be an important
  source of phytochemicals with antioxidant properties which are important to human
  health, such as chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, quercetin-3-O-rutinoside, and isorhamnetin
  frequently associated with antioxidant and anti-inflamatory properties (Valko et
  al., 200728\\.  Valko , M. , Leibfritz , D. , Moncol , J. , Cronin , M. T. , Mazur
  , M. and Telser , J. 2007. Free radicals and antioxidants in normal physiological
  functions and human disease. International Journal of Biochemistry &amp; Cell Biology,
  39: 44–84.   \nView all references). The gluconasturtiin, largely present in this
  type of plant material (Fahey et al., 20017\\.  Fahey , J. W. , Zalcmann , A. T.
  and Talalay , P. 2001. The chemical diversity and distribution of glucosinolates
  and isothiocyanates among plants. Phytochemistry, 56: 5–51.   \nView all references),
  as we detected in baby-leaf watercress, is the precursor of the one of the most
  important ITCs, the PEITC (Fahey et al., 20017\\.  Fahey , J. W. , Zalcmann , A.
  T. and Talalay , P. 2001. The chemical diversity and distribution of glucosinolates
  and isothiocyanates among plants. Phytochemistry, 56: 5–51.   \nView all references).
  This compound inhibits phase I enzymes, which are responsible for the activation
  of many carcinogens in animals and induces phase II enzymes, which are associated
  with enhanced excretion of carcinogens (Rose, Faulkner, Williamson, &amp; Mithen,
  200021\\.  Rose , P. , Faulkner , K. , Williamson , G. and Mithen , R. 2000. 7-Methylsulfinilheptyl
  and 8-methylsulfinilloctyl isothiocyanates from watercress are potent inducers of
  phase II enzymes. Carcinogenesis, 21: 1983–1988.   \nView all references). Thus,
  watercress may have exceptionally good antioxidant properties and anticarcinogenic
  potential. Therefore, the consumption of watercress, particularly the baby-leafs,
  must be incremented due to their beneficial properties for human health.\n\n\n\n\n\nMajority
  of health-promoting phenolics and GSs are present in organic baby-leaf watercress
  at higher levels. From antioxidant point of view, it was showed that organic baby-leaf
  watercress possesses a substantial antioxidant capacity. The above results allows
  us to conclude that fresh and organic baby-leaf watercress can be used easily as
  natural source of bioactive compounds due to the presence of flavonoids and GSs,
  more precisely caffeic acid, quercetin-3-O-rutinoside, isorhamnetin, and gluconasturtiin.
  Further studies in order to identify new compounds and to compare samples from different
  production systems are under progress in our laboratory.\n\n\n\nThe authors acknowledge
