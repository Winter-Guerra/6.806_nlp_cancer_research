  epidemiological studies proposed that lignans may protect against breast cancer
  by exerting anticarcinogenic activity. Levels of enterolactone were determined in
  serum samples of 1,250 cases and 2,164 controls from a large population-based case-control
  study. We assessed the association between serum enterolactone and postmenopausal
  breast cancer risk using conditional logistic regression accounting for potential
  risk and confounding factors. Fractional polynomials were used to determine the
  function that best fitted the data. Moreover, we assessed heterogeneity by estrogen/progesterone/herceptin
  status of the tumor. Additionally, a meta-analysis with seven further studies addressing
  enterolactone concentrations and breast cancer risk was performed. Postmenopausal
  breast cancer risk decreased with increasing serum enterolactone levels . A significant
  inverse association for ER+/PR+ as well as ER−/PR− tumors was observed, with a significantly
  stronger association for ER−/PR− tumors. The association for ER−/PR− tumors did
  not differ by expression of HER2. The meta-analysis yielded a significant reduced
  pooled risk estimate of: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.55-0.77) comparing the highest to the lowest
  quantiles of enterolactone levels. We found strong evidence for a significant inverse
  association between serum enterolactone and postmenopausal breast cancer risk, which
  was stronger for ER−PR− than for ER+PR+ tumors but not differential by further expression
  of HER2. The overall evidence together with other studies supports an inverse association
  between higher serum enterolactone levels and postmenopausal breast cancer risk.\n\nPhytoestrogens
  are a group of biologically active compounds that have been shown to protect against
  hormone-dependent cancers, in particular, breast cancer.1-4 Their protective inverse
  association with breast cancer may be due to either estrogenic or antiestrogenic
  properties.5-8 Because of their chemical structure, phytoestrogens can compete with
  endogenous estrogen for binding to the estrogen receptor of the tumor, thereby plausibly
  reducing the hormonal effect of the endogenous estrogens.9 In addition to this,
  phytoestrogens also have antioxidative and antiproliferative properties and thereby
  may also reduce cancer risk.10 The two main groups of phytoestrogens are the isoflavones
  and the lignans. Isoflavones, in particular, genistein, are mostly found in soy
  products. Only a few nonsoy plants contain isoflavones; but, at lower concentration,
  isoflavones do not importantly contribute to phytoestrogen intake in Western diets.11,
  12 Plant lignans are widely present in whole grain, berries, vegetables, fruits,
  flaxseeds and other types of seeds and are the main source of phytoestrogens in
  Western populations.13 Plant lignans are metabolized into mammalian lignans in the
  human gut. Serum or urinary levels of enterolignans can serve as an alternative
  indicator of individual dietary lignan intake. The advantage of these biomarkers
  is that they do not rely on self-reported dietary intake or on dietary databases
  for lignan quantification.\n\nSeveral studies in Western populations have investigated
  the association of either dietary lignan intake or lignan biomarkers with pre- or
  postmenopausal breast cancer risk, with inconsistent results.14-21 Two recently
  published meta-analyses showed that high serum or urinary enterolactone levels were
  associated with a nonsignificant reduced postmenopausal breast cancer risk, whereas
  high consumption of dietary lignans was associated with a significant reduced postmenopausal
  breast cancer risk.22, 23\n\nThe objective of our study was to examine the association
  of the major serum enterolignan with the risk of postmenopausal breast cancer in
  a large German study population with Western dietary habits. Additionally, we investigated
  whether this association differs by ER, progesterone receptor or herceptin receptor
  status of the tumor.\n\n\nBMI: body mass index; CI: confidence interval; ER: estrogen
  receptor; FFQ: Food Frequency Questionnaire; HER2: herceptin receptor; HRT: hormone
  replacement therapy; OR: odds ratio; PR: progesterone receptor; TR-FIA: time-resolved
  fluoroimmunoassays; RE: risk estimates\n\n\n\n\n\nA population-based case-control
  study Mammary carcinoma Risk factor Investigation was carried out in two study regions
  in Germany. German-speaking women aged 50-74 years, diagnosed with histologically
  confirmed primary invasive or in situ breast cancer between January 1, 2001 and
  September 30, 2005 in Hamburg and between August 1, 2002 and July 31, 2005 in the
  Rhine-Neckar-Karlsruhe region, were identified through participating clinics and
  the Hamburg Cancer Registry.\n\nFor each patient, two controls matched for birth
  year and study center were randomly selected using resident registries. In total,
  3,464 postmenopausal cases and 6,657 postmenopausal controls were participated in
  this study. Women were defined as postmenopausal if they reported their last natural
  menstrual bleeding at least 12 months before the reference date, or a bilateral
  oophorectomy, or cessation of menses due to treatment of disease other than breast
  cancer by either radiation or chemotherapy. Those above age 55 years whose menopausal
  status was unclear because of hysterectomy or hormone use were also considered postmenopausal
  but assigned an unknown age at menopause. More detailed information on the study
  population can be found elsewhere.24 Face-to-face interviews were carried out by
  trained interviewers using a standardized questionnaire to collect information on
  sociodemographic characteristics as well as putative risk factors for breast cancer,
  including reproductive history, use of hormone replacement therapy, family history
  of breast cancer, physical activity, smoking and alcohol consumption.\n\nFurthermore,
  a self-administered Food Frequency Questionnaire was applied to collect information
  on nutritional habits in the year before diagnosis of breast cancer or the year
  before FFQ completion for controls.\n\nAll participants gave written confirmed consent.
  The study was approved by the ethics committees of both the University of Heidelberg
  and the University of Hamburg and conducted in agreement with the Helsinki declaration.\n\n\n\nNonfasting
  serum samples were obtained from participants in the Rhine-Neckar-Karlsruhe region
  and stored at −80°C. Hemolytic samples were excluded from the measurements, resulting
  in 1,250 cases and 2,164 controls. For cases, median time between diagnosis and
  blood collection was about 3 months. The range for blood collection was 0-37 months
  after diagnosis; nevertheless, for 98.6% of participants, blood collection was within
  1 year of diagnosis.\n\n\n\nEnterolactone was measured by time-resolved fluoroimmunoassays
  according to the methods developed and validated by Adlercreutz et al. and Wang
  et al.25, 26 The measurements were conducted using the enterolactone kit as described
  by the manufacturer Labmaster Laboratory in Turku Finland. In brief, 150 μl of serum
  was incubated overnight at 37°C with 150 μl of 100 mM acetate buffer, mixed with
  150 μl aliquot of serum and incubated overnight at 37°C. Diethyl-ether was used
  to extract unconjugated phytoestrogen after hydrolysis. Two diethyl-ether phases
  were combined and evaporated to dryness using a water bath. Finally, the dried residues
  were dissolved in assay buffer and measured using TR-FIA. All batches were mixed
  and measured blinded with respect to case-control status and included two quality
  controls at varying positions on the assay plate. Single measurements were performed
  for all samples. For the quality controls for enterolactone in 33.1 nmol sample
  volume, the mean intra- and interassay coefficient of variation were 10.8 and 19.2%,
  respectively.\n\n\n\nClinical and pathologic tumor characteristics were abstracted
  from hospital records and pathology reports. Hormone receptor status was ascertained
  using immunohistochemical testing, with immunoreactive scoring according to Remmele
  and Stegner.27 The Remmele scoring system combines both the intensity of staining
  and the percentage of positive cells. The staining intensity is categorized into
  four groups, 1 = weak staining, 2 = moderate staining and 3 = strong staining).
  The percentage of positive cells was categorized into five groups. A cut-off point
  of 0-2 was interpreted as negative tumors, and ≥3 was interpreted as positive tumors.
  HER2 was assessed using standardized immunohistochemical testing, followed by a
  fluorescent in situ hybridization test in the case of weak positive reaction. The
  scoring is either FISH-negative when normal levels of the gene are present or FISH-positive
  when excessive amounts of the gene are present.27, 28\n\n\n\nThe association between
  serum enterolactone and risk of postmenopausal breast cancer was assessed using
  conditional logistic regression. Odds ratios and their corresponding 95% confidence
  intervals were calculated using the PROC LOGISTIC procedure of the SAS statistical
  software package, version 9.2.\n\nFractional polynomials were used to determine
  the function that best fitted the data.29 The continuous variable for enterolactone
  concentration was entered into the multivariate logistic regression models via a
  set of defined transformations , allowing for a maximum of two terms in the model.
  Using fractional polynomials, we found that the log-transformed model best fitted
  our data, indicating a nonlinear relationship between serum enterolactone concentrations
  and postmenopausal breast cancer risk. Based on this, serum enterolactone levels
  were logarithmically transformed to achieve normality. The value 0.001 was assigned
  to phytoestrogen levels that were below detection limit, and the value 300 nmol/l
  was assigned to values that were above quantification level.\n\nQuintiles were calculated
  using the distribution of serum concentrations in the controls. Crude and multivariate
  analyses were stratified by year of birth. For multivariate analyses, participants
  with missing information on any of the covariates were excluded from the analyses.
  All multivariate analyses were adjusted for breast cancer risk factors and potential
  confounding factors that changed the risk estimate by ≥10%. The adjustment factors
  were given as follows: menopausal induction, body mass index, occupational level,
  first-degree family history of breast cancer, history of benign breast disease,
  number of pregnancies, age at menarche, breastfeeding history, total number of mammograms,
  smoking habit, alcohol consumption and use of phytoestrogen supplements. Physical
  activity, fruit, vegetable and fiber intake did not substantially change the REs
  and were therefore excluded from the adjusted model. To test for trend, the log-transformed
  continuous serum concentration of enterolactone was used in the logistic regression
  model. The significance level for the trend analyses was 0.05.\n\nPolytomous logistic
  regression analysis was used to assess the association of serum enterolactone with
  postmenopausal breast cancer risk by ER and PR status of the tumor. We further examined
  the association between serum enterolactone and the risk of breast cancer according
  to the combined ER/PR status of the tumor. Moreover, we assessed the association
  of serum enterolactone by combined ER/PR/HER2 status.\n\nBecause adjuvant chemotherapy
  might have an effect on the levels of phytoestrogen biomarkers, we performed a sensitivity
  analysis by dividing our study population into two groups; the first group had blood
  collection before start of chemotherapy or did not undergo chemotherapy, and the
  second group had blood collection after start of chemotherapy. Additionally, we
  performed a sensitivity analysis to investigate if the association was different
  according to timing of blood collection before or after median time between diagnosis
  and blood collection. Tests for heterogeneity were performed using the Q statistic
  with a significance level of 0.05.\n\nMeta-analysis of epidemiologic studies addressing
  enterolactone concentrations and breast cancer risk, including the present study,
  was carried out using the \"meta\" and \"rmeta\" packages of the statistical software
  environment R. To select epidemiological studies that reported on the association
  of serum/urinary lignans on breast cancer risk, a systematic Medline search was
  performed for publications between 1997 and December 2010. We used a combination
  of key words such as breast, phytoestrogens, lignans, enterolactone, serum, plasma,
  urine and epidemiological studies. Moreover, cited references in the retrieved articles
  were carefully reviewed to identify possible additional articles that might have
  been missed in the initial search. Suitable publications were assessed by three
  authors independently. The most fully adjusted REs and CIs for the highest quantile
  compared to the reference quantile from each study were used for the meta-analyses.
  The statistical analyses included a test of heterogeneity to determine whether the
  study results were significantly heterogeneous. Fixed-effect models were used when
  heterogeneity was low. Otherwise, random effects models were used.30 The individual
  study results and combined pooled estimates were illustrated in forest plots. Analyses
  were conducted for all women combined and for postmenopausal women separately. Moreover,
  analyses were stratified by study design for studies on postmenopausal breast cancer
  risk.\n\n\n\nThe mean age of the cases and controls was 63 years. Cases were more
  likely than controls to have an earlier age at menarche, a lower number of pregnancies,
  no breast feeding history, a history of benign breast disease, a higher number of
  mammograms, a first degree family history of breast cancer and to have never smoked
  and were less likely to use phytoestrogen supplements. There was no difference between
  cases and controls with respect to menopausal induction, BMI, occupational class
  and alcohol consumption. The median serum enterolactone concentration was 19.5 nmol/l
  in cases and 22.8 nmol/l in controls.  \n\n\nThe crude OR for the highest versus
  lowest quintile of serum enterolactone in relation to postmenopausal breast cancer
  risk was 0.66. After adjustment for breast cancer risk factors and potential confounding
  factors, the estimates did not change substantially. Significantly reduced ORs were
  also observed for the second, third and fourth quintile compared to the lowest quintile.
  Restriction to invasive cases also did not change results substantially.  \n\n\nWe
  investigated the association of serum enterolactone with postmenopausal breast cancer
  risk by ER and PR status of the tumor. Enterolactone levels were associated with
  both ER+ tumors and ER-tumors. However, the association was stronger for ER-tumors.
  We also observed a significant inverse association in both PR+ tumors and PR− tumors,
  but without significant effect heterogeneity.  \n\n\nAnalyses by combined ER/PR
  status of the tumor yielded the strongest inverse association for the ER−/PR− tumors,
  with an OR for the highest compared to the lowest quintile of 0.36, with significant
  heterogeneity between ER−/PR− and ER+/PR+ tumors.\n\nThe additional consideration
  of HER2 expression for tumor subtypes did not indicate effect heterogeneity. There
  was a significant inverse association of enterolactone levels with breast cancer
  for ER−/PR−/HER2+ as well as ER−/PR−/HER2− tumors. For ER+/PR+/HER− tumors, a significant
  association was observed only for the highest quintile. There was no association
  with ER+/PR+/HER+ tumors. However, results by HER2 expression should be interpreted
  with caution due to the relatively small sample size in these subgroups.\n\nMedian
  enterolactone levels were 22.0 and 21.5 nmol/l for blood donation before and after
  chemotherapy, respectively. The association between serum enterolactone and postmenopausal
  breast cancer risk did not differ by blood collection before or after start of chemotherapy
  nor by blood collection within or after the median time between diagnosis and blood
  collection.\n\nThe breast cancer REs of studies included in the meta-analysis are
  shown in. Overall, a significant association with breast cancer risk was observed,
  with a pooled RE of 0.72 comparing the highest quantile to the reference quantile
  of enterolactone. For postmenopausal women, the highest quantile was associated
  with a significantly reduced pooled RE of 0.66. When stratifying the analysis for
  studies on postmenopausal breast cancer risk by study design, we observed a significantly
  reduced postmenopausal breast cancer risk both in prospective cohort/nested case-control
  studies and in case-control studies with pooled RE of 0.70 and pooled RE of 0.64,
  respectively.\n\nFigure 1\\. Association between serum, plasma and urine enterolactone

  and case-control studies are shown.\n\n\n\n\nWe found that circulating enterolactone
  concentrations in the highest compared to the lowest quintile were associated with
  statistically significantly reduced risk of postmenopausal breast cancer. Moreover,
  the relationship between serum enterolactone and postmenopausal breast cancer risk
  was nonlinear. The inverse associations with serum enterolactone were significantly
  stronger for ER− compared to ER+ tumors but did not differ by PR status of the tumor.
  The risk reduction associated with high enterolactone levels was also significantly
  stronger for ER−/PR− compared to ER+/PR+ tumors and did not further differ by HER2
  expression.\n\nOur findings of a significant inverse association of serum enterolactone
  with postmenopausal breast cancer risk corroborate the results of a relatively large
  Danish prospective cohort study.31 Several previous studies on serum, plasma and
  urine enterolactone concentrations in postmenopausal women found inverse but not
  statistically significant associations with breast cancer risk3, 32 or no association.17,
  33-35 This could have been in part due to small sample sizes of each of these studies
  and corresponding limited statistical power to detect a possible inverse association
  of enterolactone. Our previous meta-analysis including seven published studies showed
  that high serum or urinary levels of enterolactone are negatively but not significantly
  associated with postmenopausal breast cancer risk.22 Inclusion of the present study
  yielded a significantly increased pooled RE for an association of higher enterolactone
  levels with reduced postmenopausal breast cancer risk. This change in the pooled
  RE emphasizes the need for large studies to provide substantive evidence for an
  inverse association of lignan exposure with postmenopausal breast cancer risk.\n\nTo
  assess whether study design had an effect on the association of serum enterolactone
  on postmenopausal breast cancer risk, we also performed a meta-analysis by study
  type. Although not all prospective studies reported inverse associations, the pooled
  REs did not indicate differential effects by study type. Therefore, the overall
  evidence up to date supports an inverse association between serum enterolactone
  levels and postmenopausal breast cancer risk. Overall, the association was weaker
  in the prospective-cohort studies than in the case-control studies. Because blood
  withdrawal is before diagnosis in prospective cohort studies and generally after
  diagnosis of breast cancer in case-control studies, it is possible that serum concentrations
  are influenced by the diagnosis and therapy of breast cancer and therefore bias
  results in case-control studies. In addition, the potential for selection bias and
  residual confounding in case-control studies could also lead to bias. Nevertheless,
  no heterogeneity was observed in the pooled REs of postmenopausal breast cancer
  risk when stratified by study design.\n\nOur study was conducted in a large German
  study population, with a diet relatively high in whole-grain products, berries and
  vegetables that are rich sources of lignans. In addition, participants were mostly
  nonsmokers, and their alcohol consumption was moderate. It is known that smoking
  is inversely correlated with serum enterolactone levels and that moderate alcohol
  consumption is positively correlated with serum enterolactone levels.36, 37 This
  may partially explain the relatively high median serum enterolactone levels in our
  study population compared to other studies.3, 33, 34, 38, 39 In our study population,
  a reduction in OR for breast cancer was already apparent in the second quintile
  although the ORs decreased further with higher enterolactone concentrations. The
  median or range of our lowest quintile is comparable to several studies that also
  reported a negative yet nonsignificant association with postmenopausal breast cancer
  risk.3, 33, 34 Moreover, significant inverse association was observed in two studies
  with generally high-serum enterolactone levels comparable to our study but only
  when considering the second quantile as reference group.31, 40 Compared to the higher
  quintiles, there were more participants with BMI above 30 and more smokers in the
  lowest quintile in our study. These variables were accounted for in the multivariable
  logistic models; however, we cannot entirely exclude residual confounding. Lignans
  are present in high amounts in fiber rich food, fruits and vegetables. We assessed
  potential confounding by these food groups in multivariable logistic models but
  observed no substantial change in the REs and therefore did not include them in
  the final models. In addition, adjustment for energy intake did not influence the
  REs.\n\nOur observation of an inverse association with circulating enterolactone
  concentrations independent of ER and PR status is in line with postulated antiproliferative
  and anticarcinogenic properties of enterolactone, in addition to antiestrogenic
  properties.7, 41 The effect was stronger among ER- tumors that could be attributable
  to anticarcinogenic properties of lignans that do not involve ERs, such as their
  influence on enzymes, proteins, angiogenesis and cell differentiation.10, 42\n\nThe
  literature regarding the association of serum enterolignans with postmenopausal
  breast cancer risk by ER or PR status of the tumor is limited. A prospective study
  conducted in the United Kingdom reported no difference by ER status of the tumor
  in a population of predominantly postmenopausal women.43 However, an association
  of plasma enterolactone with a decreased risk of ER− but not ER+ postmenopausal
  breast cancer was observed in a Danish study.31 A Swedish study among postmenopausal
  women observed an inverse association of plasma enterolactone for ERα and ERβ tumors,
  with significantly different REs for ERβ and ERβ tumors.40 When combining our findings
  by ER status with those of the first two published studies31, 43 included in our
  recently published meta-analysis,22 the pooled estimates for ER+ tumors and ER−
  tumors were 0.72 and 0.47, respectively, nevertheless, without significant heterogeneity
  between the estimates. Therefore, further large studies will be required to confirm
  whether the association is differential by ER status.\n\nThe association between
  measured enterolignans and breast cancer risk by PR status has not been investigated
  previously. A large prospective study investigated the effect of dietary enterolignans,
  by ER and PR status of the tumor and reported an inverse association of dietary
  enterolactone for both ER− and PR+ tumors.44\n\nWe observed an inverse association
  of enterolactone for both ER+/PR+ and ER−/PR− tumors, but the association was stronger
  in ER−/PR−. To our knowledge, the effect of serum enterolignans has not been previously
  assessed according to combined ER/PR tumor status. Only one study investigated association
  of calculated enterolignans with breast cancer risk by combined ER/PR status and
  reported an inverse association for ER+/PR+ but not for ER−/PR− tumors.44\n\nThis
  is the first study to consider heterogeneity of the risk association of serum enterolactone
  also by HER2 expression. Our data, suggesting no differential risk by HER2 status,
  are corroborated by the absence of other lines of evidence for an effect of enterolactone
  on HER2 expression. Sample sizes in these subgroups were limited, and further studies
  with larger number of participants are needed to confirm these results.\n\nOur study
  has several methodological advantages. To our knowledge, it is the largest study
  with sufficient power to investigate the association of serum enterolactone with
  postmenopausal breast cancer risk. We restricted our analyses to postmenopausal
  women and investigated risk associations by ER and PR status and, additionally,
  by HER2 status. We used fractional polynomials to identify the best-fitted model
  for the data. Moreover, two sensitivity analyses were performed to investigate whether
  time of blood collection or chemotherapy influence the association with serum enterolactone
  levels, and no heterogeneity was observed.\n\nSimilar to most epidemiological studies,
  only one measure of enterolactone in nonfasting serum samples was performed, which
  might not reflect long-term exposure to lignan-rich diets. Nevertheless, feeding
  studies showed that serum enterolactone levels do not decrease rapidly.13 In addition,
  another study showed that the reliability coefficient of a single measurement of
  enterolactone was relatively high, i.e., 0.6 for three repeated measurements during
  2 years.45 Antibiotic use was not recorded that might have influenced the bioavailability
  of phytoestrogens.18 Moreover, biomarker measurements provide more precise data
  than dietary information, reflecting the bioavailable amount of ingested lignans.
  Furthermore, serum levels may have been also influenced by the disease status as
  blood samples were collected after breast cancer diagnosis, thereby not representing
  prediagnosis levels.\n\nIn conclusion, results of our study suggest that high enterolactone
  levels are inversely associated with postmenopausal breast cancer risk in this Western
  population. The inverse association was stronger for ER−/PR− than for ER+/PR+ tumors,
  but did not appear to be different from further stratification according to expression
  of HER2. These findings may have important health implications for women in Western
  populations with very low phytoestrogen consumption. Further prospective studies
  in large populations with large range in intake levels of lignans are needed to
  define the association between circulating enterolactone levels and the subsequent
  risk of breast cancer according to menopausal status and ER/PR status of the tumor.\n\n\n\nWe
