  The aim of this study was to review studies that evaluated the effects of cooking
  techniques on carotenoids and anthocyanins in vegetables and to release a meta-analysis
  of the findings. A literature search was conducted to identify studies that evaluated
  the effects of cooking techniques on the levels of carotenoids and anthocyanins
  in vegetables. The database search found 404 results, and an additional 18 articles
  from 1992 to 2013 were selected that met the inclusion criteria. A meta-analysis
  with a random effect model was conducted using the weighted response ratios calculated
  for each experiment. Significant reductions of carotenoid levels after microwaving
  and frying and an increase after stewing were reported; for anthocyanins, reduction
  was observed after moist-heat techniques such as pressure boiling and pressure steaming,
  and steaming tended to reduce their concentration. Increases of anthocyanin levels
  were observed in dry-heat cooking techniques such as microwaving and baking. Cooking
  techniques influence the levels of natural pigments in vegetables, and depending
  on the technique, their levels may increase or decrease. Carotenoids were most degraded
  in frying and most increased during the stewing technique, while anthocyanins were
  most degraded in pressure steaming and most increased in the microwaving technique.'
