  Trans Fats Enhance Doxorubicin-Induced Cardiotoxicity in Mice.md
text: "\n\nThis study investigated the combined effects of trans fat diet  and doxorubicin
  upon cardiac oxidative, inflammatory, and coagulatory stress. TFD increased trans
  fatty acid deposit in heart, and decreased protein C and antithrombin-III activities
  in circulation. TFD plus doxorubicin treatment elevated activities of plasminogen
  activator inhibitor-1, lactate dehydrogenase, and creatine phosphokinase. This combination
  also raised xanthine oxidase activity, and enhanced cardiac levels of reactive oxygen
  species, interleukin -6, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and monocyte chemoattractant
  protein-1 than TFD or doxorubicin treatment alone. TFD alone increased cardiac nuclear
  factor kappa B  activity, but failed to affect expression of NF-B and mitogen-activated
  protein kinase. Doxorubicin treatment alone augmented cardiac activity, mRNA expression,
  and protein production of NF-B and MAPK. TFD plus doxorubicin treatment further
  upregulated cardiac expression of NF-B p65, p-p38, and p-ERK1/2. These findings
  suggest that TFD exacerbates doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity.\n\nIt has been
  documented that the intake of trans fat  rich diet increased the risk of coronary
  insufficiency, myocardial infarction, atherosclerosis, and metabolic disorders.
  Harvey and others  reported that TF activated inflammatory responses and led to
  endothelial dysfunctions. Iwata and others  indicated that elaidic acid  and linoelaidic
  acid  induced superoxide production in endothelial cells. Those studies suggest
  that TF could promote oxidative and inflammatory progression, and cause cardiovascular
  injury. Our previous study found that TF diet changed hepatic fatty acid profile,
  and increased hepatic inflammatory cytokines including interleukin -6 and monocyte
  chemoattractant protein -1 in mice. Thus, it is possible that dietary TF alters
  cardiac fatty acid composition, and enhanced cardiac oxidative and inflammatory
  stress.\n\nDoxorubicin  is a widely used chemotherapeutic agent for a variety of
  cancers. Its practical therapeutic use is limited because of its acute and chronic
  cardiotoxicities. It is reported that doxorubicin evokes oxidative reactions in
  NADPH microsomal systems, and stimulates superoxide formation in heart, especially
  submitochondrial particles, which leads to overproduction of reactive oxygen species
  \ and causes cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Furthermore, it has been indicated that nuclear
  factor kappa B  and mitogen-activated protein kinase  are involved in doxorubicin-induced
  cardiotoxicity, and the activation of these pathways facilitates the production
  of inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis -alpha. Since TF and doxorubicin
  have adverse effects upon cardiac health, it is hypothesized that their interaction
  may exacerbate cardiac injury. In addition, Swystun and others  reported that doxorubicin
  augmented thrombin-antithrombin complex formation, and favored coagulation or thrombosis.
  It seems hemostatic disorder also warrants attention when doxorubicin is used. Thus,
  our present study was designed to investigate the effects of TF and/or doxorubicin
  upon the variation of coagulation factors such as fibrinogen and anticoagulation
  factors such as protein C in order to understand their impact upon hemostatic balance.\n\nThe
  major purpose of this present study was to examine the combined effects of TF-rich
  diet plus doxorubicin upon cardiac oxidative, inflammatory, and coagulatory stress.
  The influence of TF and/or doxorubicin on cardiac expression of NF-B and MAPK was
  also evaluated.\n\nShortening was purchased from Tai-Yi Co.. Doxorubicin hydrochloride
  was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co.. All chemicals used in these measurements were
  the highest purity commercially available.\n\nThree-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were
  obtained from Natl. Laboratory Animal Center. Use of the mice was reviewed and approved
  by China Medical Univ. animal care committee. Mice were housed on a 12-h light-12-h
  dark schedule, and fed with mouse standard diet for 1-wk acclimation. Mice were
  then divided into 2 groups, one continuously consumed normal diet, and the other
  was switched to a diet prepared by a commercial shortening, which was rich in trans
  fatty acids, and defined as TF diet. Diet composition is presented in Table 1.  \n\nAfter
  8-wk feeding, ND or TFD groups were further divided into 2 subgroups, in which doxorubicin
  \ or saline was given via one single i.p. injection. Each group had 10 mice. After
  48 h, mice were killed with carbon dioxide. Blood was collected, and plasma was
  separated from erythrocytes immediately. Heart from each mouse was collected and
  weighted. Then, 0.1 g cardiac tissue was homogenized in 2 mL phosphate buffered
  saline  on ice, and the homogenate was collected. The protein concentration of homogenate
  was determined by the method of Lowry and others  using bovine serum albumin as
  a standard. Sample was diluted to 1 mg protein/mL, and used for measurements.\n\nTotal
  lipids were extracted from cardiac tissue; triglyceride concentration  was quantified
  by a triglyceride kit. Fatty acid composition of shortening, diet, or heart was
  analyzed by a HP5890 gas chromatography equipped with FID and 30-m Omegawax capillary
  column. Fatty acids were quantified by measuring areas under identified peaks, and
  heptadecanoic acid was used as an internal control. Results are reported as mg/g
  diet or tissue. The fatty acid compositions of shortening, ND, and TFD are shown
  in Table 2 and 3.  \n\nPlasma lactate dehydrogenase  and creatine phosphokinase
  \ activities were assayed using commercial kits. C-reactive protein  level  was
  determined by a commercial ELISA kit. For hemostatic analyses, blood samples were
  anticoagulated using sodium citrate. Plasma fibrinogen level  was measured using
  a commercial kit. Plasminogen activator inhibitor -1 activity  was assayed by a
  commercial kit. The activities of antithrombin -III and protein C in plasma were
  determined by chromogenic AT-III and protein C kits, and were shown as percentage
  of those in normal human plasma.\n\nMalondialdehyde  and glutathione  levels in
  cardiac tissue were measured by using commercial kits. The method described in Privratsky
  and others  was used to analyze the production of ROS in cardiac tissue. Briefly,
  10 mg tissue was homogenized in 1 mL of ice cold 40 mM Tris-HCl buffer. After filtrating
  through a whatman Nr. 1 filter paper to remove tissue debris, the homogenate was
  further diluted to 0.25% with the same buffer. Then, samples were loaded with 40
  L 1.25 mM nonfluorescent dye 2, 7-dichlorofluorescin in methanol, and incubated
  at 37 C for 30 min in the dark. The fluorescence intensity of sample was measured
  using a fluorescent microplate reader  with excitation wavelength at 488 nm and
  emission wavelength at 535 nm. Results are expressed as relative fluorescence unit
  \ per mg protein. Cardiac activities of glutathione peroxidase  and superoxide dismutase
  \ were determined by commercial assay kits. Xanthine oxidase  activity was measured
  spectrophotometrically by monitoring the formation of uric acid from xanthine through
  the increase in absorbance at 293 nm.\n\nCardiac tissue was homogenized in 10 mM
  Tris-HCl buffered solution  containing 2 M NaCl, 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic
  acid, 0.01% Tween 80, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and centrifuged at 9000
  \ g for 30 min at 4 C. The resultant supernatant was used for cytokine determination.
  The levels of IL-6, IL-10, TNF-alpha, and MCP-1 were assayed by cytoscreen immunoassay
  kits.\n\nNF-B p50/65 DNA binding activity in nuclear extract of heart was determined
  by a commercial kit. The binding of activated NF-B was examined by adding a primary
  polyclonal anti-NF-B p50/p65 antibody, and a secondary antibody conjugated with
  horseradish peroxidase, and the 3,3,5,5-tetramethylbenzidine substrate. The absorbance
  at 450 nm was read. Values are expressed as relative optical density  per mg protein.\n\nTotal
  RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent. One g RNA was used to generate cDNA, which
  was amplified using Taq DNA polymerase. PCR was carried out in 50 L reaction mixture
  containing Taq DNA polymerase buffer  and 2.5 U Taq DNA polymerase. The specific
  oligonucleotide primers of targets are as follow: NF-B p50, forward, 5-GGA GGC ATG
  TTC GGT AGT GG-3, reverse, 5-CCC TGC GTT GGA TTT CGT G-3; NF-B p65, 5-GCG TAC ACA
  TTC TGG GGA GT-3, reverse, 5-CCG AAG CAG GAG CTA TCA AC-3; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
  dehydrogenase, forward, 5-TGA TGA CAT CAA GAA GGT GGT GAA G-3, revere, 5-CCT TGG
  AGG CCA TGT AGG CCA T-3. The cDNA was amplified under the following reaction conditions:
  95 C for 1 min, 55 C for 1 min, and 72 C for 1 min. Twenty-eight cycles were performed
  for GAPDH and 35 cycles were performed for others. Generated fluorescence from each
  cycle was quantitatively analyzed by using the Taqman system based on real-time
  sequence detection system. In this study, mRNA level was calculated as percentage
  of the ND group with saline treatment.\n\nCardiac tissue was homogenized in buffer
  containing 0.5% Triton X-100, and protease-inhibitor cocktail. This homogenate was
  further mixed with buffer, and boiled for 5 min. Sample at 40 g protein was applied
  to 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred to a nitrocellulose
  membrane  for 1 h. After blocking with a solution containing 5% nonfat milk for
  1 h to prevent nonspecific binding of antibody, membrane was incubated with mouse
  anti-NF-B p50, anti-NF-B p65, anti-p38, anti-phospho-p38, anti-JNK, anti-phospho-JNK,
  anti-ERK1/2, anti-phospho-ERK1/2  monoclonal antibody  at 4 C overnight, and followed
  by reacting with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody 3.5 h at room temperature.
  The detected bands were quantified by an image analyzer  and GAPDH was used as a
  loading control. The blot was quantified by densitometric analysis. Results were
  normalized to GAPDH, and given as arbitrary units.\n\nThe effect of each treatment
  was analyzed from 10 mice  in each group. All data were expressed as mean  standard
  deviation. Statistical analysis was done using one-way analysis of variance, and
  post hoc comparisons were carried out using Dunnets t-test. Differences with P ;
  0.05 were considered statistically significant.\n\nIn current study, shortening
  rich in trans fatty acids  was used to prepare TFD, which led to 71.93-fold increase
  in trans fatty acids when compared with ND. After 8-wk TFD intake, cardiac triglyceride
  content increased 40%; and cardiac levels of saturated and trans fatty acids also
  raised 1.52-fold and 32.5-fold, respectively. As shown in Table 5, doxorubicin treatment
  alone caused 6.05- and 4.11-fold elevation in LDH and CPK activities; and TFD treatment
  alone lowered 15% protein C and 31% AT-III activities. However, TFD plus doxorubicin
  further raised 1.32-fold LDH, 1.26-fold CPK, and 1.16-fold PAI-1 activities when
  compared with doxorubicin treatment alone.  \n\nDoxorubicin treatment alone decreased
  GSH content, increased ROS and MDA levels, declined GPX and SOD activities, and
  enhanced XO activity in heart. TFD intake alone decreased GSH level and raised XO
  activity. Compared with doxorubicin alone, the combination of TFD and doxorubicin
  enhanced 33% ROS production and 42% XO activity, and reduced 16% GSH content. As
  shown in Table 7, doxorubicin treatment alone increased circulating CRP level, and
  cardiac IL-10 and MCP-1 levels, but TFD did not affect test inflammatory factors.
  Compared with doxorubicin alone, TFD plus doxorubicin led to 2.61-, 2.04-, 2.92-,
  and 1.63-fold elevation in cardiac IL-6, IL-10, TNF-alpha, and MCP-1 levels.  \n\nDoxorubicin
  treatment alone augmented cardiac activity, mRNA expression, and protein production
  of NF-B. TFD elevated NF-B activity, but failed to affect mRNA expression and protein
  production. Compared with doxourbicin alone, TFD plus doxorubicin led to 53%, 55%,
  and 81% increase in NF-B activity, NF-B mRNA expression, and NF-B p65 protein production.
  Doxorubicin treatment alone upregulated p-p38, p-ERK 1/2, and p-JNK, but TFD did
  not affect MAPK. Compared with doxourbicin alone, TFD plus doxorubicin led to 52%
  and 43% elevation in p-p38 and p-ERK1/2 production.\n\nFigure 1\\. NF-B p50/65 DNA

  did not affect procoagulant and fibrinolytic markers such as fibrinogen and PAI-1
  in young healthy men. Our data revealed that 8-wk TFD intake did not change these
  factors in circulation of mice. However, we found this diet diminished the activities
  of AT-III and protein C, 2 anticoagulatory factors. AT-III inhibits the activities
  of several proteases in the coagulation cascade, and protein C inactivates coagulation
  factors such as factors Va and VIIIa. Since dietary TF decreased anticoagulatory
  protection, it is highly possible that long-term TF intake promotes coagulatory
  progression and favors the development of thrombosis.\n\nIn our present study, TF
  intake increased cardiac deposit of trans fatty acids; and markedly lowered GSH
  level, raised XO activity, and enhanced NF-B activity in heart, which in turn enhanced
  cardiac oxidative responses. Moreover, we notified that TF intake increased cardiac
  levels of arachidonic acid  and saturated fatty acids such as stearic acid. It is
  known that these fatty acids promote lipotoxicity to cardiovascular system, in which
  arachidonic acid is a precursor for several key inflammatory mediators including
  prostaglandins  and stearic acid could induce Toll-like receptor 4/2-independent
  inflammation. Although TFD alone did not affect cardiac levels of test inflammatory
  factors, the increased C18:0 and C20:4 in heart contributed to raise inflammatory
  potential. These findings support that TF intake alters cardiac fatty acid profile
  and impairs cardiovascular functions.\n\nAs reported by others, our results agreed
  that doxorubicin activated both NF-B and MAPK pathways, and caused severe cardiac
  oxidative stress via declining enzymatic antioxidant defense and increasing ROS
  and MDA formation. Morris and others  reported that elevated CRP was an early biomarker
  of doxorubicin induced cardiotoxicity. Besides CRP, our present study further found
  that this drug augmented cardiac formation of MCP-1 and IL-10, 2 inflammatory biomarkers.
  MCP-1, a chemotactic factor for activating monocytes and macrophages, could recruit
  monocytes to the sites of injury. The increased MCP-1 release from doxorubicin treatment
  indicated that cardiac tissue was injured and local immune response was activated.
  Teng and others  reported that doxorubicin raised serum IL-10 level, and contributed
  to myocardial inflammation. However, IL-10 is an anti-inflammatory cytokine. Thus,
  the overproduced cardiac IL-10 in our present study not only revealed cardiac ongoing
  inflammatory status, but also highly implied that this tissue might intend to suppress
  inflammatory response via self-protective action.\n\nTFD plus doxorubicin substantially
  raised the activity of PAI-1, the primary physiologic inhibitor of fibrinolysis,
  which subsequently suppressed fibrinolysis and favored thrombosis and atherogenesis.
  Thus, our findings suggest that TFD plus doxorubicin disturbs hemostatic balance,
  promoted coagulation, and deteriorated cardiovascular functions. In addition, this
  combined treatment led to less GSH content, lower GPX and SOD activities, greater
  ROS, IL-6, TNF-alpha and MCP-1 production in heart than either TFD or doxorubicin
  treatment alone. These findings indicated that this combination synergistically
  enhanced cardiac oxidative and inflammatory injury. It is interesting to find that
  this combination effectively raised XO activity. XO is a powerful oxygen radical-generating
  source, and inhibition of XO activity could improve some biomarkers in patients
  with cardiovascular diseases. The raised cardiac XO activity from this combined
  treatment definitely facilitated ROS generation and diminished cardiac antioxidative
  defense. Our data regarding increased LDH and CPK activities, 2 cardiac injury markers,
  also agreed that this combination caused severe cardiotoxicity. Furthermore, our
  data indicated that this combination aggravated the activation of NF-B p65, p-p38,
  and p-ERK1/2. Apparently, TFD plus doxorubicin more efficiently activated NF-B and
  MAPK, upstream regulatory pathways responsible for the production of oxidative and
  inflammatory factors such as ROS and TNF-alpha. These findings suggest that cardio-toxicity
  from TFD plus doxorubicin could be ascribed to the upregulation of both NF-B and
  MAPK pathways.\n\nAfter calculated and justified, the daily TF consumed by mice
  in our present study was equal to 4 g/d for a 70-kg human male. Our results revealed
  that TFD alone at this dose did not cause severe cardiovascular disorder, and was
  not an effective activator for NF-B and MAPK pathways. It is highly possible that
  TF intake altered cardiac fatty acid composition, and abated antioxidative and anti-inflammatory
  defense in this tissue. Thus, the following use of doxorubicin easily destroyed
  cardiovascular protective system and caused damage. These results suggest that TF
  should be eliminated for patients with doxorubicin therapy in order to avoid additively
  or synergistically oxidative and/or inflammatory injury in heart.\n\nIn conclusion,
  the combination of diet rich in trans fats and doxorubicin enhanced cardiac oxidative
  and inflammatory stress via activating NF-B and MAPK pathways, as well as increasing
  cardiac generation of ROS, TNF-alpha, and MCP-1. This combination also caused hemostatic
  imbalance. These findings support that dietary trans fat promotes doxorubicin-induced
  cardiotoxicity.\n\n"
