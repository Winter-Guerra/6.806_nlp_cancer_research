  breast cancers and in women who are at an increased risk of breast cancer. Acquired
  resistance to this drug and its toxicity still pose a clinically significant problem,
  especially in the prevention setting. Isothiocyanates present in cruciferous plants,
  such as sulforaphane or erucin, have been shown to reduce growth of breast cancer
  cells in vivo and in vitro. In this study, we explored their ability to sensitize
  cancer cells to 4-hydroxytamoxifen.\n\n\n\nWe used three ER-positive breast cancer
  cell lines, T47D, MCF-7 and BT-474, as well as the drug-resistant T47D and MCF-7
  derivatives. We examined the effect of 4-hydroxytamoxifen, isothiocyanates and their
  combinations on cell viability by MTT and clonogenic assays. Impact of treatments
  on the levels of proteins engaged in apoptosis and autophagy was determined by Western
  blotting.\n\n\n\nIsothiocyanates act in a synergistic way with 4-hydroxytamoxifen,
  and co-treatment reduces breast cancer cell viability and clonogenic potential more
  effectively than treatment with any single agent. This is connected with a drop
  in the Bcl-2/Bax ratio and the level of survivin as well as increased PARP cleavage,
  and elevation in ADRP, the mitochondrial stress marker. Moreover, isothiocyanates
  sensitize 4-hydroxytamoxifen-resistant T47D and MCF-7 cells to the drug.\n\n\n\nIsothiocyanates
  enhance response to 4-hydroxytamoxifen, which allows for reduction of the effective
  drug concentration. Combinatorial strategy may hold promise in development of therapies
  and chemoprevention strategies against ER-positive breast tumors, even those with
  acquired resistance to the drug.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBreast cancer is the leading cause
  of cancer-related deaths in women . Estrogen receptor-positive breast tumors comprise
  approximately 75 % of the breast cancer cases . Tamoxifen is a drug conventionally
  used in prevention and treatment of advanced estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer
  in pre- and postmenopausal women . Tamoxifen and its active metabolite, 4-hydroxytamoxifen,
  act as an estrogen antagonist or agonist, depending on tissue and organ type. The
  ER, a regulator of expression of genes involved in the ER-positive tumor progression,
  is able to stimulate cancer growth in two different ways: a classical way by binding
  to its responsive elements in a given gene’s promoter, and nongenomic through activation
  of growth factor receptors and cellular pro-survival kinases . 4-Hydroxytamoxifen
  demonstrates estrogen antagonist activity in breast cells. All ER antagonists display
  the same crucial mechanism of action: They bind ER and block its activity . However,
  many breast cancer cells show a primary or secondary endocrine resistance. Statistics
  indicates that in 30–50 % of women with ER-positive breast cancer, de novo or intrinsic
  resistance to tamoxifen occurs and in many patients tumor recurrence is observed
  after drug therapy. Different molecular mechanisms may lead to a development of
  cellular resistance to the hormone therapy and protect cancer cells from death induced
  by drugs. Among them, the loss of ER or alteration in its structure and function,
  overactivation of serine/threonine protein kinase B, alteration in the ER signal
  transduction, and crosstalk between the ER and growth factor receptors have been
  reported . Moreover, long-term administration of the selective ER modulator may
  lead to serious side effects, such as menopausal symptoms, venous thromboembolic
  events, endometrial hyperplasia, polyps and cancer or ovarian cysts .\n\nIsothiocyanates
  are naturally occurring phytochemicals present in cruciferous plants. Sulforaphane
  \ and its reduced analog, erucin , exhibit chemopreventive and antitumor activities
  against different types of cancers. The molecular mechanisms of SFN action include
  inhibition of phase I carcinogen-activating enzymes, induction of phase II carcinogen
  detoxification enzymes, and induction of the cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Preventive
  activity of SFN has been reported in numerous in vivo models. Administration of
  SFN by oral gavage inhibited development of mammary tumors in female Sprague–Dawley
  rats treated with the 9,10-dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene carcinogen  or prostate carcinogenesis
  and pulmonary metastasis in TRAMP mice . Feeding A/J mice with SFN and its N-acetylcysteine
  conjugate resulted in an inhibition of malignant progression of lung adenomas induced
  by the tobacco carcinogens . Sulforaphane protected male Syrian hamsters treated
  with the pancreatic carcinogen, N-nitroso-bis(2-oxopropyl)amine, against the development
  of a pancreatic tumor . These observations were supported by in vitro studies, showing
  that SFN induces apoptosis, for instance, in PC-3 prostate cancer cells , MDA-MB-231,
  MDA-MB-468, MCF-7 and T47D human breast cancer cell lines , UM-UC-3 bladder tumor
  cells , A549 nonsmall lung cancer cells  and HT29 colon cancer cell lines . SFN
  has been also shown to inhibit cell cycle progression of different cancer cells,
  including PC-3 prostate cancer cells , HT29 human colon cancer cells , PaCa-2 and
  PANC-1 pancreatic cancer cells  or MCF-7 breast cancer cells . In addition, it has
  been shown that SFN induces autophagy . In the case of cells with the defective
  apoptosis, autophagy may lead to the type II programmed cell death. In some conditions,
  however, it may suppress or delay cell death, such as in the case of prostate or
  breast cancer cells treated with SFN .\n\nErucin is abundant in salad rocket and
  can be generated by interconversion of SFN. It has been reported that erucin also
  modulates phase I enzymes  and phase II enzymes , induces pro-apoptotic signals
  and influences cell cycle progression, for instance, in human leukemia cells , HepG2
  human hepatocellular carcinoma cells , human lung carcinoma A549 cells , bladder
  J82, UM-UC-3 cancer cells  and more recently—in MCF-7 breast cancer cells .\n\nOn
  the basis of the data described above as well as recently reported results showing
  that SFN inhibits pro-survival Akt-mTOR-S6K pathway in phenotypically different
  breast cancer cells , we hypothesize that application of ITC may enhance anti-proliferative
  activity of 4-hydroxytamoxifen. In the present study, we used three ER-positive
  breast cancer cell lines, T47D, MCF-7 and BT-474, as well as drug-resistant derivatives
  of T47D and MCF-7 cells, to compare their sensitivity to structurally related ITC
  as well as 4-hydroxytamoxifen, and test whether these naturally occurring phytochemicals
  sensitize ER-positive breast cancer cells to the drug.\n\n\n\n\n\nR,S-sulforaphane
  and erucin were obtained from LKT Laboratories. They were prepared in DMSO and stored
  at a stock concentration of 10 mM at −20 °C. RPMI-1640 medium, fetal bovine serum
  was purchased from Life Technologies.-4-hydroxytamoxifen, penicillin–streptomycin
  solution, DMSO, sulforhodamine B, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
  bromide, anti-rabbit and anti-β-actin antibodies conjugated with HPR were from Sigma-Aldrich.-4-hydroxytamoxifen
  was dissolved in ethanol at a concentration of 10 mM and stored at 4 °C. Antibodies
  against Bcl-2, Bax, survivin and ADRP were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, antibody
  against PARP was from Cell Signaling Technology and anti-LC3 antibody was purchased
  from Medical and Biological Laboratories Co., Ltd..\n\n\n\nER-positive breast cancer
  cell lines, MCF-7, T47D and BT-474, were cultured in RPMI-1640 supplemented with
  10 % fetal bovine serum and 1 % penicillin/streptomycin solution. Tamoxifen-resistant
  derivatives of MCF-7 and T47D cells were obtained by continuous exposure of parental
  cell lines to increasing concentrations of 4-hydroxytamoxifen for over 15 months.
  Cells were cultured in RPMI medium without phenol red, with 10 % charcoal stripped-fetal
  bovine serum. For the first 3 months, parental cells were continuously treated with
  100 nM 4-hydroxytamoxifen. After this time, the concentration of the drug was increased
  to 500 nM. The medium with the appropriate concentration of 4-hydroxytamoxifen was
  changed every 4 days. ER-negative breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231, was maintained
  in MEM supplemented with 10 % FBS, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, nonessential amino acids
  and antibiotics. Each cell line was incubated at 37 °C in 5 % CO2. Twenty four hours
  after plating, cells were treated with the desired concentration of isothiocyanate
  with or without-4-hydroxytamoxifen or an equivalent volume of ethanol and/or DMSO
  for 96 h with medium replacement after 48 h.\n\n\n\nCells were seeded at density
  2 × 103 cells per well in 96-well plate and allowed to grow for 24 h. After that
  time cells were treated with increasing concentrations of ITC, increasing concentrations
  of 4-hydroxytamoxifen or combinations of both. Control samples were treated with
  DMSO, ethanol or DMSO and ethanol at appropriate concentrations. After 48 h, medium
  was replaced with the fresh medium containing the same supplements. After 96 h of
  treatment, 25 μl of MTT-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) stock solution was added
  to each well for 4 h. Next, the formazan crystals were dissolved in 100 % DMSO,
  and absorbance was measured at 570 nm with a reference filter of 660 nm in Victor3
  microplate reader. To inhibit autophagy induction, cells were pretreated with 50
  nM wortmannin and then treated with ITC and 4-hydroxytamoxifen as described above.
  After 96 h, 100 μl of 10 % aqueous solution of ice-cold trichloroacetic acid was
  added for 1 h. Plates were washed with water, allowed to air-dry and stained with
  100 μl of 0.4 % sulforhodamine B solution in 1 % acetic acid for 15 min. Cells were
  washed 5 times with 1 % acetic acid and dried. After addition of 10 mM Tris base,
  the absorbance was measured at 570 nm using Victor3 microplate reader. Data were
  obtained from at least three independent experiments, and each treatment condition
  assayed in triplicate.\n\n\n\nCells were plated at density 5 × 104 per 100 mm plate.
  After 24 h, cells were treated with 0.5 μM 4-hydroxytamoxifen, ITC or combinations
  of these chemicals. Control samples were treated with ethanol and/or DMSO at appropriate
  concentration for 8 days, and every 2 days the medium was changed to the fresh one
  with the same supplements. After 8 days of treatment, cells were trypsinized and
  plated at 800 per 100 mm plate in duplicate. Colonies were stained with crystal
  violet and counted 2 weeks or 4 weeks after plating. The experiment was repeated
  twice.\n\n\n\nMCF-7 and T47D cells were plated at density 2.5 × 105 and BT-474 at
  density 5 × 105 per 100 mm plate. Cells were treated as described in the “Cell culture
  and treatment” section. Control samples were treated with ethanol and/or DMSO at
  appropriate concentrations. After 48 h, medium was changed to fresh one and the
  compounds were added again. After 96 h, cells were lysed in a solution containing
  50 mM Tris, 1 % Triton X-100, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, protease and phosphatase
  inhibitor cocktails and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm at 4 °C for 30 min. Immunoblots
  were performed as previously described .\n\n\n\nData were analyzed using GraphPad
  Prism software. One-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni’s multiple comparison test
  was used to determine statistical significance of differences in the measured variables.
  Differences were considered significant at p ; 0.05.\n\nData from MTT viability
  assay were analyzed using the method of Chou and Talalay  and CompuSyn software
  to determine the dose that gives the median effect, linear correlation coefficient
  in case of treatment with a single compound, and combination index for samples treated
  with two compounds. The CI is a quantitative measure of the degree of interaction
  between drugs. CI &lt; 1, CI = 1 and CI &gt; 1 denote synergism, additivity and
  antagonism, respectively. Variable ratios of ITC and 4-hydroxytamoxifen were used.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe
  investigated the effect of sulforaphane, erucin and 4-hydroxytamoxifen alone or
  in combinations on viability of three ER-positive breast cancer cell lines: MCF-7,
  T47D and BT-474. Both ITC inhibited cell growth in a dose-dependent manner. T47D
  and MCF-7 cells were similarly sensitive to sulforaphane and to erucin. Interestingly,
  marked differences in sensitivity of BT-474 cell line to sulforaphane and erucin
  were observed with IC50 values of 15 or 19.7 μM, respectively. Sensitivity of T47D,
  MCF-7 and BT-474 cell lines to 4-hydroxytamoxifen was dependent of its dose, and
  IC50 values after 96 h of treatment were 4.2, 3.2 and 5.7 μM, respectively.\n\n\nDose-dependent
  effect of SFN, ERN or 4-hydroxytamoxifen on survival of T47D, MCF-7 and BT-474 cell
  lines after 96 h of treatment. Control samples were treated with appropriate concentrations
  of DMSO. Viability was assayed by MTT method as described in “Materials and methods”.
  Results shown are mean ± SE of three independent experiments performed in triplicate\n\nNext,
  we assessed viability of three breast cancer cell lines after co-treatment with
  ITC at concentrations equal or lower than their respective IC50 value and 4-hydroxytamoxifen
  at a concentration close to its IC20. The results obtained showed that combination
  of ITC and 4-hydroxytamoxifen inhibited cell viability more efficiently than either
  compound used alone: It was about 20 % lower upon combined treatment than viability
  of cells treated with ITC and about 30–50 % lower than viability of cells treated
  with 4-hydroxytamoxifen only. To elucidate whether the greater effect of combined
  treatment than mono-treatment is due to synergistic action of the used compounds,
  we calculated a combination index for the nonconstant ratio combinations using the
  method of Chou and Talaly and data from the MTT viability assays. As shown in Table
  1, CI values for tested drug combinations were below 1, which indicates synergism.\n\n\nEffect
  of 96-h treatment with sulforaphane, 4-hydroxytamoxifen or both compounds on viability
  of T47D, MCF-7 and BT-474 cells. Viability was assayed by MTT method as described
  in “Materials and methods”. Results shown are mean ± SE of three independent experiments
  performed in triplicate. p values were calculated by one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni’s
  multiple comparison test\n\n\nEffect of 96-h treatment with erucin, 4-hydroxytamoxifen
  or both compounds on viability of T47D, MCF-7 and BT-474 cells. Results shown are
  mean ± SE of three independent experiments performed in triplicate. p values were
  calculated by one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni’s multiple comparison test\n\n\nCombination
  indexes of sulforaphane or erucin and 4-hydroxytamoxifen in breast cancer cells.
  CI &lt; 1 indicates synergism  \n\n\n\n\nTo elucidate whether decreased viability
  of breast cancer cells treated with the combination of ITC and 4-hydroxytamoxifen
  results from an apoptosis induction, we compared caspase-dependent cleavage of PARP
  in control cells as well as in cells treated with ITC and/or the drug. The immunoblotting
  analysis showed that 4-hydroxytamoxifen at 0.5 μM in T47D cells had no effect on
  PARP status while at 0.5 μM in MCF-7 cells and at 1 μM concentration in BT-474 cell
  line had a minimal effect on apoptosis induction as assessed by PARP cleavage. Sulforaphane
  and erucin at 5 μM concentrations induced PARP cleavage with intensity dependent
  on the cell line. However, combined treatment with SFN or ERN and 4-hydroxytamoxifen
  further elevated PARP cleavage.\n\n\nEffect of co-treatment of breast cancer cell
  lines with 4-hydroxytamoxifen and sulforaphane on PARP cleavage and levels of Bcl-2,
  Bax, survivin and ADRP. T47D and MCF-7 cells were treated with 5 μM sulforaphane,
  and/or 0.5 μM 4-hydroxytamoxifen. BT-474 cells were treated with 5 μM sulforaphane
  and/or 1 μM 4-hydroxytamoxifen. Blots were stripped and reprobed with anti-β-actin
  antibody to ensure equal protein loading. Results are plotted as mean ± SE from
  three independent experiments, significantly different compared with single agent-treated
  samples or significantly different compared with one of the single agent-treated
  samples by one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni’s multiple comparison test. Data
  for PARP refer to the faster migrating band marked as  and are given relative to
  samples treated with SFN alone. Blots shown are representative of at least three
  independent experiments\n\n\nEffect of co-treatment of breast cancer cell lines
  with 4-hydroxytamoxifen and erucin on PARP cleavage, levels of Bcl-2, Bax, survivin
  and ADRP. T47D and MCF-7 cells were treated with 5 μM erucin and/or 0.5 μM 4-hydroxytamoxifen.
  BT-474 cells were treated with 5 μM erucin and/or 1 μM 4-hydroxytamoxifen. Blots
  were stripped and reprobed with anti-β-actin antibody to ensure equal protein loading.
  Results are plotted as mean ± SE from 3 independent experiments, significantly different
  compared with single agent-treated samples or significantly different compared with
  one of the single agent-treated samples by one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni’s
  multiple comparison test. Data for PARP refer to the faster migrating band marked
  as  and are given relative to samples treated with ERN alone. Blots shown are representative
  of at least three independent experiments\n\nIt has been previously reported that
  ITC induce apoptosis mainly through the mitochondrial pathway; thus, we determined
  the level of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and pro-apoptotic Bax upon treatment with ITC
  and/or the drug. As shown in Figs. 4, 5, combinations of SFN or ERN with 4-hydroxytamoxifen
  decreased the Bcl-2 level most efficiently, while the Bax level was elevated. Thus,
  reduction of Bcl-2/Bax ratio in cells treated with combinations of compounds might
  lead to mitochondria-mediated induction of apoptosis. As mitochondrial dysfunction
  may trigger formation of lipid droplets, we determined the level of adipocyte differentiation-related
  protein which decorates membranes of these organelles. As can be seen in Figs. 4
  and 5, the ADRP level was elevated in cells treated with SFN or ERN and 4-hydroxytamoxifen
  when compared with cells treated with a single compound. Finally, the level of survivin,
  which is an inhibitor of caspase 3, 7 and 9, and is a mitosis promoter, was efficiently
  reduced by combined treatment as compared to controls and a single compound treatment,
  excluding BT-474 cells, where ERN alone increased survivin level about 100 % above
  control, and although combination with 4-hydroxytamoxifen lowered its amount, it
  was still higher than in the drug-only-treated cells.\n\n\n\nNumerous studies have
  shown that MCF-7 and T47D cells undergo autophagy under adverse conditions, such
  as tamoxifen treatment. We investigated whether ITC induce autophagy in these cells
  and whether co-treatment with 4-hydroxytamoxifen and ITC potentiates this process.
  We analyzed conversion of soluble LC3-I to the lipid-bound LC3-II form which is
  an established marker of autophagy. As can be seen in Fig. 6a, c, clear intensification
  of LC3 processing was observed in T47D and MCF-7 cells treated with combination
  of compounds. In BT-474 cells, combination of ITC and 4-hydroxytamoxifen slightly
  increased LC3-II, while the LC3-I form was still abundant as compared with control
  cells or cells treated with either drug alone. To reconcile if autophagy induced
  by the investigated compounds plays pro-survival or pro-death role, we applied wortmannin
  which inhibits first stages of this process and determined viability of cells. As
  shown in Fig. 6b, d, inhibition of autophagy induced by combination of SFN or ERN
  and 4-hydroxytamoxifen in T47D and MCF-7 cells reduced their viability, which suggests
  that in these cell lines, autophagy plays a protective role. On the contrary, BT-474
  cells revealed increased survival upon treatment with combinations when autophagy
  was inhibited, which suggests that in this case, autophagy contributes to cell death.\n\n\nAutophagy
  process in T47D, MCF-7 and BT-474 cells treated with sulforaphane, erucin, 4-hydroxytamoxifen
  or combinations. T47D and MCF-7 cells were treated with 5 μM sulforaphane, 5 μM
  erucin and/or 0.5 μM 4-hydroxytamoxifen, and BT-474 cells were treated with 5 μM
  SFN, 5 μM ERN and/or 1 μM 4-OH-T. a, c, e LC3 processing was determined by immunoblotting.
  The blots were stripped and reprobed with anti-β-actin antibody to ensure equal
  protein loading. Results are plotted as mean ± SE from 3 independent experiments,
  significantly different compared with both single agent-treated samples or significantly
  different compared with one of the single agent-treated samples by one-way ANOVA
  followed by Bonferroni’s multiple comparison test. b, d, f Impact of autophagy on
  viability of cells treated with indicated compounds was assessed by SRB method upon
  autophagy inhibition by 5 nM wortmannin. p &lt; 0.001\n\n\n\nAs one of the main
  problems in anticancer therapies is recurrence of the disease, effective treatment
  should irreversibly eliminate cancer cells. Thus, we assessed the clonogenic potential
  of breast cancer cells treated with 4-hydroxytamoxifen and/or ITC for 8 days and
  allowed for their recovery in a drug-free medium for 2–4 weeks. Results presented
  in Fig. 7 clearly show that clonogenic potential of cells treated with combination
  of 4-hydroxytamoxifen and SFN is significantly lower than in the case of cells treated
  with each agent alone. Moreover, combined treatment reduces clonogenicity compared
  to controls by about 60 % or 70 %. Erucin per se is a highly cytotoxic agent. Its
  combination with 4-hydroxytamoxifen potentiates cytotoxicity in MCF-7 and T47D cell
  lines by about twofold, while has no further effect on clonogenicity of BT-474 cells.\n\n\nEffect
  of treatment with sulforaphane, erucin, 4-hydroxytamoxifen or combination of isothiocyanate
  and the drug on clonogenic potential of T47D, MCF-7 and BT-474 cells. Cells were
  exposed to 5 μM SFN, 5 μM ERN and/or 0.5 μM or 1 μM 4-hydroxytamoxifen for 8 days.
  After that time, cells were replated at lower confluences and allowed to growth
  for 2 or 4 weeks in drug-free medium. Colonies arisen from cells retaining proliferative
  potential were counted, and results are shown as mean ± SE of two independent experiments
  performed in duplicate. Statistical significance of difference was determined by
  one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni’s multiple comparison test, and p &lt; 0.001
  as compared to ITC and 4-OH-T alone, p &lt; 0.001 as compared to 4-OH-T only and
  p &lt; 0.05 as compared to erucin only, p &lt; 0.001 as compared to 4-OH-T only
  and p &gt; 0.05 as compared to erucin only\n\n\n\nAs acquired resistance to tamoxifen
  occurs frequently, we decided to verify whether ITC affect sensitivity of tamoxifen-resistant
  cells to this drug. Thus, we established T47D and MCF-7 derivatives, which were
  able to grow in media containing 500 nM of 4-hydroxytamoxifen and retained ER expression.
  T47D tamR cell line also appeared to be less sensitive to sulforaphane or erucin
  than parental cell line. Importantly, ITC sensitized tamoxifen-resistant cells to
  the drug: Combination of SFN or ERN with 500 nM of 4-hydroxytamoxifen caused a statistically
  significant drop in viability of the cells tested as compared to the treatment with
  any single compound.\n\n\nIsotiocyanates sensitize to 4-hydroxytamoxifen drug-resistant
  cells. Tamoxifen-resistant T47D and MCF-7 derivatives were obtain as described in
  “Materials and methods”. Viability of T47D tamR or MCF-7 tam R after 96-h treatment
  with sulforaphane, erucin or/and 4-hydroxytamoxifen was assessed by MTT assay. e–g
  Viability of ER-negative MDA-MB-231 cells was determined after treatment with increasing
  concentrations of 4-hydroxytamoxifen, SFN and/or 4-OH-T, ERN and/or 4-OH-T. Results
  shown are mean ± SE of three independent experiments performed in triplicate. Significantly
  different compared with both single agent-treated samples or significantly different
  compared with SFN-only-treated samples by one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni’s
  multiple comparison test\n\nIt has been shown that sulforaphane effectively lowers
  viability of both ER-positive and ER-negative breast cancer cells . To determine
  whether SFN or ERN sensitize cells to 4-hydroxytamoxifen in an ER-independent manner,
  we used ER-negative MDA-MB-231 cell line, which appeared resistant to the drug at
  concentrations used by us for ER-positive cells. Combination of 5 μM sulforaphane
  or erucin with 500 nM of 4-hydroxytamoxifen did not potentiate sensitivity of MDA-MB-231
  cells to any single agent. However, we observed enhanced activity of the combination
  of ITC and 4-hydroxytamoxifen toward ER-negative cells when 4-hydroxytamoxifen was
  applied at higher, cytotoxic concentration. Combination of ERN with 5 μM 4-hydroxytamoxifen
  reduced viability of MDA-MB-231 more efficiently than any compound used alone.\n\n\n\nEpidemiological
  studies indicate that frequent intake of cruciferous vegetables rich in ITC may
  reduce the risk for developing cancers . Studies performed with laboratory animals
  and cancer cell lines confirmed this notion and gave insight into molecular mechanism
  of not only chemopreventive but also anticancer activities of these phytochemicals.
  It has been previously documented for different breast cancer cell lines that sulforapahane
  downregulates ER-α, EGFR and HER2 proteins  as well as PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway
  \ whose overactivity may contribute to resistance of ER-positive cancers to endocrine
  therapy. It has been also shown that sulforaphane at 10 μM concentration potentiated
  anti-proliferative activity of tamoxifen used at 1 μM concentration in the ER-negative
  MDA-MB-231 cells, which was further enhanced by green tea polyphenols due to chromatin
  modification and reactivation of the ER expression . The purpose of our study was
  to experimentally test the hypothesis that ITC at relatively low concentration may
  intensify the anti-proliferative effect of 4-hydroxytamoxifen on ER-positive breast
  cancer cell lines. We used two structurally related ITC and breast cancer cell lines
  which differ in the amount of ER and HER2 receptors as well as generation times.\n\nWe
  demonstrate that combinations of 4-hydroxytamoxifen at a low inhibitory concentration
  and any isothiocyanate at concentrations lower than their IC50 values inhibit cell
  proliferation of ER-positive human breast cancer cells more efficiently than any
  compound used alone. The results of the MTT tests show that BT-474 cell line was
  the least sensitive to the drug or ITC. It could be related to a slower growth rate
  of BT-474 cells. Their doubling time exceeds 100 h, while doubling rate for MCF-7
  cells is about 29 and T47D—about 32 h. Moreover, these cell lines differ in the
  expression levels of growth factor receptor genes. BT-474 cell line is characterized
  by comparable level of ER but much higher level of HER2/neu when compared to MCF-7
  cells or T47D . Preclinical research and clinical trials have revealed that magnitude
  of the response to treatment with tamoxifen correlated with the ER level and its
  crosstalk with other growth factor receptors, such as HER2  which may explain higher
  resistance of BT-474 cells to treatment with 4-hydroxytamoxifen or ITC. However,
  despite this, viability of BT-474 cells was significantly decreased in experimental
  variants treated with a combination of phytochemicals and 4-hydroxytamoxifen compared
  to cells treated with any compound alone. Moreover, combinations of 4-hydroxytamoxifen
  at a low concentration with SFN or ERN efficiently inhibited clonogenic potential
  of the breast cancer cells. It is worth noting that ability of cells to proliferate
  was significantly reduced after only 8 days of treatment with combinations and subsequent
  cessation of therapy. Longer therapy might have a more pronounced effect.\n\nSeveral
  studies have shown that high concentrations of erucin and sulforaphane induce apoptosis-associated
  proteolytic cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase in different cancer cell lines
  . Here we demonstrate that combinations of sulforaphane or erucin with 4-hydroxytamoxifen
  at low concentrations induce apoptosis of breast cancer cell lines more efficiently
  than any compound used alone. Substantial drop in Bcl-2/Bax ratio upon combined
  treatment, as well as an increased level of ADRP, the marker of mitochondrial stress-mediated
  lipid droplet formation, points toward involvement of mitochondrial pathway in apoptosis
  induction in each cell line; however, death receptor pathway cannot be excluded.\n\nWe
  also determined the effect of single as well as combined treatment with ITC and
  4-hydroxytamoksifen on survivin level in all three cell lines. Survivin inhibits
  apoptosis and promotes cell proliferation and angiogenesis. This protein is undetectable
  in majority of normal adult tissues; however, it is often overexpressed in tumors,
  including breast cancers . High level of survivin correlates with progression of
  cancer and resistance to therapies ; thus, its targeting might improve efficacy
  of chemo- or radiotherapies . We observed that SFN, ERN or 4-hydroxytamoxifen downregulates
  survivin to a similar extent in T47D and MCF-7 cells and combinations of the drug
  and ITC potentiate this effect. Interestingly, in BT-474 cells, ITC alone elevated
  the survivin level when compared with controls, which might explain lower sensitivity
  of this cell line to SFN or ERN. However, their combination with the 4-hydroxytamoxifen
  decreased the survivin level. Here, the net result of combined treatment on cell
  viability might be caused not only through survivin but also by Bcl-2 level modulation.
  The Bcl-2 level changed in an opposite manner to that of survivin: It was elevated
  by 4-hydroxytamoxifen and reduced by ITC and their combinations with the drug. Levels
  of anti-apoptotic proteins are regulated by multiple pathways; thus, the impact
  of chemicals used by us on Bcl-2 or survivin expression might be related to the
  genetic background of the cells used.\n\nWe also observed that ITC and 4-hydroxytamoxifen
  induce processing of the LC3 protein, a specific marker of autophagosomes , especially
  when used in combinations. Autophagy is one of the most important strategies for
  protein degradation and protein/organelle quality control mechanism, and during
  cellular stress, it provides nutrients to support metabolism . Accumulated evidence
  suggests that a basal or slightly increased level of autophagy can protect cells
  against apoptosis; however, prolonged or intensive autophagy can lead to cell death
  . For instance, SFN-induced autophagy in prostate as well as breast cancer cells
  played a protective role  but benzyl isothiocyanate-induced autophagy in breast
  cancer cells contributed to their death . The role of autophagy induced by tamoxifen
  or its metabolites in breast cancer cells is controversial. Initial studies documented
  that tamoxifen and 4-hydroxytamoxifen caused an autophagic death of MCF-7 cells
  . However, more recent data indicate that in response to 4-hydroxytamoxifen, only
  a small part of cell population dies, while majority of cells are arrested in growth
  and viable. Interestingly, elevation of autophagy in living cells decreased drug-induced
  death, while autophagy inhibition resulted in a more robust caspase-dependent death
  of MCF-7 cells . Moreover, the authors have shown that in tamoxifen-resistant MCF-7
  cells, autophagy inhibition sensitized these cells to the antiestrogen . In our
  study, the combined treatment with ITC and 4-hydroxytamoxifen also induced protective
  autophagy in MCF-7 and T47D cell lines, while in BT-474 cells contributed to their
  lower survival. The reason for the observed differences is not known at this moment;
  however, it was previously reported that BT-474 cells contain a high basal level
  of autophagosomes , which is in agreement with our observation showing an increased
  LC3-II level even in nontreated cells. Thus, it is possible that upon treatment
  with ITC and 4-hydroxytamoxifen autophagy reaches the threshold necessary for cell
  death.\n\nFinally, we show that SFN or ERN efficiently sensitized tamoxifen-resistant
  variants of MCF-7 and T47D cells to 4-hydroxytamoxifen. It seems that synergistic
  activity of ITC and the drug used at a low concentration is ER dependent, which
  is evidenced by the fact that our T47D tamR and MCF-7 tamR cells retained this receptor
  and are sensitive to the combined treatment, while in the MDA-MB-231 cells, which
  are devoid of ER, ITC do not abrogate resistance to 0.5 μM 4-hydroxytamoxifen. On
  the other hand, ITC, especially erucin, might potentiate the cytotoxic activity
  of the drug used at 5 μM concentration. However, high concentrations of tamoxifen
  have been shown to have an ER-independent nongenomic effect in ER-negative breast
  and other cancer cells . Thus, it is possible that the mechanism of sensitization
  to 4-hydroxytamoxifen by ICT might be related to the drug dose.\n\nImportant question
  arises when coming to in vivo use of combined therapy: whether micromolar concentrations
  of ITC are achievable in humans. In case of SFN, it has been shown that in human
  subjects who ingested 100 g of broccoli as a soup, its peak plasma concentrations
  reached 2.2 μM . A more recent study shows that 3 h after consumption of broccoli
  sprouts providing 200 μmol SFN, plasma levels of total SFN metabolites reached about
  2 μM concentration . In rats, after an oral dose of 50 μmol of SFN was delivered,
  its plasma concentration peaked around 20 μM at 4 h after dosing . The bioavailability
  of erucin is not known at this time. However, SFN and ERN are structurally similar
  and reveal similar pharmacokinetics. Moreover, interconversion of SFN to ERN has
  been reported in rats and humans . Concentration of these ITC in plasma or tissue
  after multiple dosing of pure compounds can be higher than after one dose of plant
  extract; however, it has not been investigated so far. In case of the drug, it has
  been shown that clinically relevant steady-state plasma concentrations of tamoxifen
  and its biologically active metabolites can be as high as 5 μM in patient sera .\n\nIn
  conclusion, our data indicate that sulforaphane or erucin, used at relatively low
  concentrations, potentiate anticancer activity of 4-hydroxytamoxifen. This effect
  is mediated by downregulation of anti-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2 and survivin
  and in consequence by induction of cell death. This strategy allows for using tamoxifen
  at lower doses, hence decreasing the level of its toxicity and improving the risk–benefit
  profile of this agent. Moreover, it might protect against acquisition by cancer
  cells the drug-resistant phenotypes during therapy.\n\n\n\nWe are grateful to Dr.
