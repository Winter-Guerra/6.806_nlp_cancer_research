text: '


  Tumor metastasis is the main cause of cancer-related deaths of patients. Breast
  cancer is highly malignant with considerable metastatic potential, which urges the
  necessity for developing novel potential drug candidate to prevent tumor metastasis.
  Here, we report our finding with Cucurbitacin E, a tetracyclic triterpenes compound
  isolated from Cucurbitaceae. The potency of CuE on breast cancer metastasis inhibition
  was assessed in vivo and in vitro. In our animal experiments, intraperitoneal administrations
  of CuE significantly inhibited breast tumor metastasis to the lung without affecting
  apoptosis or proliferation of inoculated 4T1 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells.
  Treatment of metastatic breast tumor cells with CuE markedly blocked tumor cell
  migration and invasion in vitro. Subsequent studies showed that CuE impaired Arp2/3-dependent
  actin polymerization and suppressed Src/FAK/Rac1/MMP involved pathway. Overall,
  our data demonstrate that CuE blocks breast cancer metastasis by suppressing tumor
  cell migration and invasion. We provide first evidence of a novel role for CuE as
  a potential candidate for treating breast cancer metastasis.

  According to statistics, breast cancer accounts for 30 % of all the cancer cases
  and ranks the second leading cause of cancer death among women. In these women,
  breast cancer metastasis poses a predominant threat to cancer-related mortality.
  Cancer metastasis is a complex cascade, which starts when a primary tumor forms
  and tumor cells break through the basement membrane. These tumor cells then circulate
  through the blood, adhere to the capillary wall, escape from the blood vessel, and
  proliferate to form metastasis. Failure in any of these steps may impair the entire
  metastatic process.


  One of the key steps in successful cancer metastasis is tumor cell migration and
  invasion, which is responsible for tumor cells enter into blood vessels as well
  as the extravasation into the secondary organs. Sustained organization of actin
  system is essential for cell migration. The Arp2/3 complex greatly accelerates actin
  polymerization, which is thought to play a vital role in actin-based cell migration
  by inducing formation of a dendritic actin network and membrane protrusions. In
  addition, the ability of tumor cells to migrate, invade and metastasize has been
  found to be related with increased Focal Adhesion Kinase  expression, phosphorylation,
  and catalytic activity. Among downstream genes of FAK, matrix metalloproteinases  have
  been identified as the major molecules in cancer metastasis. Previous study revealed
  that Src-FAK complex on MMP regulation is associated with signaling from Rac1 to
  Jun N-terminal kinase, which mediated extracellular matrix proteolysis and cell
  invasion.


  Cucurbitacins are tetracyclic triterpenes derived from Cucurbitaceae  that contain
  circa 800 species in 130 genera and are among the economically most important families
  of plants. Previous reports showed cucurbitacins exhibited pharmacological effects,
  such as anti-inflammatory, anti-fertility, anti-virus, anti-cancer and so on. Cucurbitacin
  E, one of cucurbitacins, could disrupt cell actin filaments and inhibit cell adhesion.
  Recent research indicated that CuE exerts its anti-angiogenesis biological effect
  mainly through the Jak/STAT3 pathway. However, the function of CuE on tumor metastasis
  and its related molecular mechanism have not yet been investigated.


  In the current study, the inhibition of breast cancer metastasis in spontaneous
  and experimental mouse models by CuE is reported. CuE also suppressed breast cancer
  cell migration, invasion, and Arp2/3-dependent actin polymerization in vitro. Moreover,
  CuE blocked Src/FAK/Rac1/MMP signaling pathway and down-regulated Arp3 expression
  in breast cancer cells. In conclusion, our data showed CuE impairs breast tumor
  metastasis via targeting tumor cell migration and invasion.


  Mouse breast tumor cell line 4T1 and human breast tumor cell line MDA-MB-231 were
  obtained from American Type Culture Collection. MDA-MB-231 cells that stably transfected
  with firefly luciferase  were kindly provided by Dr. Qian Zhao at School of Medicine
  in Shanghai Jiaotong University. All cells were incubated at 37 C under a humidified
  5 % CO2. Purified CuE  was purchased from Shanghai Zhan Shu Chemical Technology
  Co. Ltd.. Matrigel was purchased from BD Bioscience. Antibodies of FAK/FAK, c-Src/c-Src,
  JNK/JNK, c-Jun/c-Jun, and cleaved caspase-3 were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology,
  and antibodies of PCNA, MMP-2, MMP-9, TIMP-1, and TIMP-2 were purchased from Abcam.
  -Actin and GAPDH were purchased from Sigma. BALB/c and nude mice were bred and maintained
  at the animal center in East China Normal University. The Animal Investigation Committee
  of the Institute of Biomedical Sciences and School of Life Sciences of East China
  Normal University approved all experimental protocols.


  This assay was performed as described previously. Briefly, 1  105 4T1 cells in 0.1
  mL PBS were injected subcutaneously into the 4th abdominal mammary fat pad  of BALB/c
  mice. On day 7, CuE  or DMSO was given via intraperitoneal injection. When the primary
  tumor became macroscopic, tumor size was measured with a caliper, and tumor volume
  was calculated according to the formula: V = L  W 2  0.52, where L and W refers
  to length and width, respectively. Mouse body weight was measured every 3 days.
  After a 25-day treatment, all the mice were killed. Lung metastases were manually
  counted using a dissecting microscope by three individuals who do not have personal
  biases with the current experiment. The lungs were fixed and prepared for H&amp;E
  staining and immunohistochemistry. The primary tumors were removed and prepared
  for immunohistochemistry, western blotting and Gelatin zymography assay.


  The experiment was performed as described previously. In brief, 1  106 MDA-MB231-Luciferase
  cells  in 0.1 mL PBS were injected into the tail vein of nude mice. Based on initial
  Luminal Imager, all mice were divided into two groups. CuE  or DMSO was given via
  intraperitoneal injection on day 0. Mouse body weight was measured every 3 days.
  After 30 days treatment of CuE, images of xenograft mice were obtained using a Xenogen
  IVIS 2000 Luminal Imager. All the mice were euthanized; the lungs were extracted
  for immunohistochemistry assay.


  Immunohistochemistry was performed as reported previously. In spontaneous and experimental
  breast tumor metastasis model, primary tumors and lungs were excised, fixed, and
  embedded in paraffin. Sections  were stained with anti-proliferating cell nuclear
  antigen  and cleaved caspase-3. H&amp;E staining was performed according to standard
  protocol. Images were taken with Leica microscope. The results were analyzed using
  Image-Pro Plus 6.0 software.


  Wound-healing migration assay was performed as described previously. When tumor
  cells grew to 8090 % confluence, cell monolayer was scraped by sterile 0.1 mL pipette
  tips, and fresh medium was added containing different concentrations of CuE. After
  12-h incubation, cells were fixed and photographed. The migrated cells were manually
  quantified. The percentage inhibition of migrated cells was expressed using 100
  % as the value assigned for untreated group.


  Modified Boyden chamber  migration assay was conducted as previously described.
  Briefly, a total of 5  104 cells  or 105  cells in 100 L serum-free medium were
  added in the upper chamber, and 600 L of medium with 10 % fetal bovine serum  was
  added at the bottom. Different concentrations of CuE were added in both chambers.
  Cells were allowed to migrate for approximately 10 h. Non-migrated cells in the
  upper chamber were removed using a cotton swab. The migrated cells were fixed in
  paraformaldehyde and stained with 0.1 % crystal violet. Migrated cells in 67 randomly
  selected fields were counted under an inverted microscope. Invasion assay was performed
  according to previous study. Briefly, the upper surface of the transwell membrane
  were coated with 20 L Matrigel  and the lower compartment of the chambers were filled
  with 500 L medium containing 10 % FBS. 5  104 cells  or 105  cells in 100 L serum-free
  medium were placed in the upper part of each transwell and treated with different
  concentrations of CuE. After incubation for 12 h, cells on the upper side of the
  filter were removed. Cells located on the underside of the filter were fixed with
  4 % paraformaldehyde and stained and counted under a light microscope. Percentage
  inhibition of migratory cells was quantified.


  MTS proliferation assay was performed as described previously. 4T1 and MDA-MB231
  cells were seeded at a density of 5  103 in 96-well plates, and treated with indicated
  concentrations of CuE. After incubation for 12, 24, and 48 h, Aqueous One Solution  was
  added, and the absorption was measured at 490 nm.


  A 1.3 kb cDNA fragment of human Arp3 was cloned into vector pcDNCA3.1 to generated
  Arp3 expression plasmids. MDA-MB231 cell was transiently transfected with the above
  plasmid using Lipofectamine 2000 according to manufacturers instruction. Briefly,
  cells were seeded on 6 cm cell culture. When cells grew to 95 % confluence, 8 g
  of plasmid DNA and 10 L Lipofectamine 2000, diluted with antibiotic/serum-free L15
  medium, were mixed gently and incubated with cells. Medium was changed 6 h after
  transfection and cells were incubated for a further 24 h. The control cells received
  blank vector and Lipofectamine 2000. To produce stably transfected cells for following
  experiments, cells were trypsinized and repalted in L15 medium containing 10 % FBS
  and 1 g/ml puromycin.


  Immunofluorescence assay was performed according to the method previously described.
  MDA-MB231 cells were plated on gelatin-coated glass coverslips. After treatment
  for indicated times, cells were fixed with 4 % PFA in PBS for 30 min, permeabilized
  for 5 min with 0.5 % Triton X-100 in PBS, and blocked with 1 % BSA in PBS for 20
  min. Coverslips were incubated with anti-Paxillin and anti-Arp3 antibodies at 4
  C overnight and then washed with PBS and incubated for 1 h with Alexa 488-conjugated
  secondary antibody. FITC-phalloidin and 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole  were further
  used to stain F-actin and nucleus, respectively. Photographs were obtained with
  Confocal microscope.


  Actin polymerization was determined by measuring the change in fluorescence intensity
  of pyrene-labeled muscle actin as described previously. Pyrene-labeled actin stock  was
  left on ice for 1 h and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm at 4 C for 30 min; supernatant
  was then transferred to a new ice bath. Arp2/3 complex  and VCA domain of WASP  were
  incubated with CuE  for 15 min on ice. Polymerization was initiated by adding actin,
  which served as control. Fluorescence was read immediately after the addition of
  actin using spectrofluorometer  to read every 1 min for the duration of the assay
  with excitation at 350 nm and emission at 410 nm.


  Cell lysates prepared: cells were treated with different concentrations of CuE  or
  different times and lysed with radioimmuno-precipitation  buffer. Tissue lysates
  prepared: in spontaneous breast tumor metastasis model, primary tumors were removed,
  well minced, and lysed with RIPA buffer. Samples were resolved on 812 % SDS-PAGE
  and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes
  were incubated in 5 %  bovine serum albumin  and stored overnight at 4 C on a shaker
  with specific primary antibodies. Membranes were washed with TBST and incubated
  for 1 h with secondary antibody  at room temperature. After several washes, the
  signals were visualized via chemiluminescence Western blot detection reagent  and
  auto-radiographic film.


  Rac1 activation assay was performed as described previously. In brief, MDA-MB231
  cells were washed with PBS and treated with different concentrations of CuE for
  6 h. Cells were then washed with PBS and lysed with lysis buffer. A total of 500
  mg of GTP-PBD  attached to glutathione beads were added to the cell lysates. The
  mixture was incubated at 4 C for 3 h, and beads were washed in lysis buffer. SDS
  loading buffer was added to the beads. Fusion protein was run on 12 % SDS-PAGE gel,
  and target protein was detected using anti-Rac1 antibody.


  Gelatin zymography assay was performed as described previously. Cell sample prepared:
  MDA-MB-231 cells were plated into 6 cm-well plates. When grew to 80 % confluence,
  serum-free medium containing different concentrations of CuE was added to replace
  with culture medium. 24 h post-medium replacement, the resultant supernatant was
  concentrated. Tissue lysates prepared: primary tumors were lysed with RIPA buffer.
  The supernatant or tissue lysates was collected and subjected to SDS-PAGE on 8 %
  gels copolymerized with 1 mg/mL of gelatin. The gels were washed in renaturing buffer  for
  an hour and then incubated overnight at 37 C in developing buffer. Bands were visualized
  by staining with 0.5 % Coomassie R-250.


  Results were statistically analyzed using the Students t test with Microsoft Excel.
  All experiments were repeated at least three times. A value of P ; 0.05 was considered
  significant.


  The 4T1 mouse breast cancer cells were obtained from BALB/c mice and easily transplanted
  into the mammary fat pad, which ensures that the primary tumor grows in the proper
  anatomical site. 4T1 cells spontaneously metastasize to secondary foci  from the
  primary sites. The anti-metastatic function of CuE was tested in vivo by implanting
  4T1 cells into 4th mammary fat pad of 7-week-old female BALB/c mice. Remarkably,
  the number of metastasized 4T1 nodules in the lungs of mice treated with CuE  reduced
  to 40 % compared with the control group. However, primary tumor size showed no evident
  difference between the treatment and control groups. These results indicated that
  CuE inhibited breast cancer metastasis in spontaneous animal tumor model but did
  not interfere with the primary tumor growth. Moreover, CuE did not cause obvious
  side effects because no indication of weight loss of mice  and morphology change
  of major organs.


  Anti-metastasis effects of CuE on spontaneous experiment. 4T1 cells  were injected
  into the fat pads of female BALB/c mice. After 7 days, the mice were administrated
  with DMSO  or CuE  via intraperitoneal injection. On day 32, the mice were killed.

  volume and mice body weight were measured using a digital caliper every 3 days.

  To further investigate the inhibitory function of CuE on human tumor metastasis,
  MDA-MB231-Luciferase  tumor cells were injected into nude mice through tail vein.
  MDA-MB231-Luciferase was tracked by an in vivo imaging system to monitor tumor metastasis.
  After 30 days, images of xenograft tumors were obtained using a Xenogen IVIS 2000
  Biophotonic Imager. The lung metastases in the treatment group significantly decreased
  by 70 % compared with those in the control group. Quantification of bioluminescence
  signal was shown in Fig. 2b. In addition, body weight in control and treatment group
  remained relatively constant. This result demonstrated that CuE was a potential
  agent for inhibiting human breast tumor metastasis.


  CuE inhibits breast tumor metastasis to the lungs. After tail vein injection of
  MDA-MB-231-luciferase cells, the mice were divided into two groups based on the
  initial bioluminescence images. On day 30, final bioluminescence images were obtained
  using a Xenogen IVIS 2000 Biophotonic Imager. a Representative bioluminescence images

  To evaluate the possible effect of CuE on proliferation and apoptosis of inoculated
  4T1 and MDA-MB231 cells in vivo, we tested the expression of proliferating cell
  nuclear antigen  and cleaved caspase-3 by immunohistochemistry analysis. Both two
  proteins were widely considered as proliferation and apoptosis biomarker, respectively.
  Our result showed CuE had little effect on cell proliferation and apoptosis of the
  4T1 primary tumor. This may explain why the volume of the primary tumors has no
  significant decrease in treated group. We next investigated whether CuE has an activity
  against proliferation and apoptosis of already disseminated breast tumor cells in
  the lung. Intriguingly, immunohistochemical analysis of PCNA and cleaved caspase-3
  in lung sections  showed no significant difference between control and treated group.
  These results imply that CuE specifically target the process of dissemination of
  breast cancer cells from the primary tumor, but not the outgrowth of established
  micrometastases in target organs.


  CuE has no effects on apoptosis or proliferation of tumor cells in vivo. a, b To
  detect the inhibitory effect of CuE on tumor cell proliferation and apoptosis in
  spontaneous experiment of 4T1, primary tumors and lungs were sectioned and probed
  with anti-PCNA and anti-cleaved caspase-3 antibody. Representative images are shown,
  Brown color indicates positive cells. c In experimental metastasis model, lung sections
  were stained with anti-PCNA and anti- cleaved caspase-3 antibody. Representative
  images are shown. Brown color indicates strong positive cells


  Our abovementioned in vivo data suggested CuE inhibit breast tumor metastasis by
  targeting tumor cell migration and invasion and we queried the effect of CuE on
  breast tumor cells in vitro. We performed wound healing and transwell migration
  assays on 4T1 and MDA-MB231 cell lines, and CuE-treated group showed reduced migrated
  cell numbers in both two cell lines. Similar results were obtained in Matrigel-coated
  transwell invasion assay. We then studied cellular proliferation inhibitory potency
  of CuE using MTS assay. Neither 4T1 nor MDA-MB231 cells showed a marked decrease
  in proliferation under different concentration ranges as well as treatment time
  frames. Western blotting assay of PARP, PCNA reinforced that CuE did not affect
  the apoptosis in breast cancer cell. Altogether, our results showed that CuE possessed
  a stronger ability on tumor cell migration and invasion than on tumor cell proliferation
  and apoptosis, which further confirmed CuE suppresses tumor metastasis by targeting
  tumor cell migration and invasion.


  CuE inhibits breast cancer cell 4T1 and MDA-MB231 migration and invasion. a CuE
  inhibits 4T1 and MDA-MB231 migration. Tumor cells were seeded in six-well plates.
  A wound was created after the cells grew into 8090 % confluence. After incubation
  for 12 h, all the groups were fixed and photographed. Dotted lines indicate the
  area occupied by the initial scraping and migrated cells were quantified by manual
  counting. b Tumor cells were seeded in the upper chamber of transwell with serum-free
  medium, and then various concentrations of CuE were added to both chambers. After
  about 10 h, migrated cells were fixed, stained, and photographed. Migrated cells
  were quantified by manual counting. c CuE inhibits 4T1 and MDA-MB231 invasion. Tumor
  cells were treated with different concentrations of CuE and allowed to invade through
  Matrigel. Invaded cell number was counted.  P &lt; 0.05,  P &lt; 0.01,  P &lt; 0.001
  versus control


  Our data of CuE inhibiting breast cell migration and invasion raised the question
  of whether CuE affect cell cytoskeleton and lamellipodia which are key cellular
  events involved in cell motility and tumor metastasis. To explain the inhibitory
  effect of CuE on tumor cell migration and invasion, immunofluorescence assay in
  breast cancer cell was performed. We observed that focal adhesion  at the leading
  edge of migrated cells and polymerized actin  were reduced in CuE-treated cells.
  The driver of lamellipodia formation, Arp2/3 complex, is also one of the most important
  regulators of actin polymerization, and to be a control center for actin-based cell
  motility. In Arp2/3 complex, Arp3 is an actin-like subunit mediating polymerization
  of the daughter filament. To further investigate the detail of CuE on breast cancer
  migration, we conducted Arp2/3-regulated actin polymerization assay in vitro. Our
  result showed, according to the manufacturers instruction, that addition of the
  CuE modestly inhibited Arp2/3-mediated actin nucleation activity in 10-min point,
  suggesting that CuE had some actin polymerization inhibitory activity. Additionally,
  our data of western blot first indicated that CuE reduced the Arp3 expression of
  MDA-MB231 breast cancer cell in a dose- and time-dependent manner. To further confirm
  these results, MDA-MB231 cells stably overexpressed Arp3 were produced. Arp3-overexpressed
  MDA-MB231 cells were less responsive to CuE in disturbing actin polymerization compared
  with its mock counterpart. All above results suggested that CuE inhibits breast
  cancer cell migration and invasion by regulating the activity and expression of
  Arp2/3 complex.


  CuE disturbs tumor cell Arp2/3-dependent actin polymerization. a MDA-MB231 cells
  were seeded on gelatin-coated coverslips. After the indicated times, cells were
  fixed in PBS containing 4 % paraformaldehyde, permeabilized using PBS containing
  0.1 % Triton X-100, and stained for F-actin  and Paxillin. b CuE has some effect
  on Arp2/3 activity. a Time course of the actin polymerization reaction performed
  in the presence of GST-N-WASP VCA domain fusion protein  and CuE. Relative fluorescence
  units at the 10 min time point of a representative experiment were plotted to quantify
  the effects of CuE. Actin alone served as control. c Arp3 expression in MDA-MB231
  was detected after incubation with CuE for the time frames indicated  and with different
  concentrations of CuE. GAPDH was used as loading control. The expression of -actin
  decreased in a dose/time-dependent manner


  Previous reports have demonstrated a role for Src/FAK signaling in tumor cell invasion
  involving proteolytic degradation of the extracellular matrix by matrix-degrading
  metalloproteinase. Recent studies have suggested that that inhibition of Src/FAK/Rac1
  signal down-regulated MMP2 and MMP9 expression, and the positive correlation between
  the level of MMPs and tumor cell migration and invasion has been established. To
  evade primary tumor, tumor cells must interact with a broad range of factors, especially
  MMPs and TIMPs. Inhibition of MMPs by synthetic and natural inhibitors  can decrease
  tumor cell migration and invasion. To investigate whether CuE could suppress Src/FAK/Rac1/MMP
  signal pathway in tumor metastasis, we tested the phosphorylation or activation
  of proteins involved in this pathways. Our data showed that CuE robustly inhibited
  activated FAK, Src, Rac1, JNK, and c-jun in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally,
  we detected the expression of MMP2, MMP9, TIMP1, and TIMP2 in both cell lysates
  and primary tumor tissues. Furthermore, we checked the activity of MMPs in tumor
  cell conditioned medium and tissue lysates. Results showed that MMP2, MMP9 expression
  and activity decreased, whereas TIMP1 and TIMP2 increased after CuE treatment. Based
  on all the results obtained, the Src/FAK/Rac1/MMP pathway may also be the potential
  pathway involved in the anti-tumor activation of CuE.


  CuE inhibits FAK/MMP-involved pathway. a MDA-MB231 cells were treated with different
  concentrations of CuE. After 6 h, cell lysates were blotted with specific antibodies.
  Active Rac1 was pulled down using the GST-PBD fusion protein on glutathione beads
  and detected with anti-Rac1 antibody. GAPDH was the loading control. b MDA-MB231
  cells were treated with different concentrations of CuE. After 24 h, cells were
  harvested, and western blot assay was performed to test the expression of MMP2,
  MMP9, TIMP1, and TIMP2. GAPDH served as loading control. MMP2 and MMP9 activity
  were detected using gelatin zymography analysis. c Western blotting and gelatin
  zymography analysis of MMP and TIMP in primary tumor tissues. Primary tumors were
  removed and then lysed in RIPA buffer. MMP2, MMP9, TIMP1, and TIMP2 were detected
  using western blot. GAPDH served as loading control. The activity of MMP2, MMP9
  were checked using gelatin zymography analysis


  The current project was conducted to investigate the effect of CuE on breast cancer
  metastasis and elucidate its underlying mechanism. Our data showed that CuE blocked
  breast cancer metastasis in vivo and suppressed tumor cell migration and invasion
  in vitro. CuE functioned as a tumor metastasis inhibitor by disturbing Arp2/3-dependent
  actin polymerization and blocking Src/FAK/Rac1/JNK/MMP signaling pathway.


  In animal models, using the safe dosage, CuE was shown to remarkably inhibit both
  human and mouse breast cancer metastasis to the lungs. Interestingly, primary tumor
  growth was not inhibited by CuE during the therapy in spontaneous animal model.
  Meanwhile, immunohistochemistry assay results showed CuE did not affect tumor cell
  proliferation and apoptosis in vivo. These results suggested CuE does not prevent
  the outgrowth of established micrometastases. Altogether, our data implied CuE suppresses
  breast tumor metastasis through blocking tumor cell migration and invasion.


  Tumor cell migration and invasion is a critical step during tumor metastasis, and
  inhibition of this step is a practical approach to antitumor treatment. Although
  we have no quantitatively assay to detect tumor cell migration and invasion in vivo,
  we took assays in vitro to support the anti-metastasis ability of CuE by targeting
  tumor cell migration and invasion. CuE was shown to inhibit MDA-MB231 and 4T1 cell
  migration and invasion under low concentration. Additionally, CuE did not inhibit
  both two tumor cell lines proliferation and apoptosis under the same treatment time
  and concentrations as migration and invasion assay. These results consist with in
  vivo experiment, suggesting breast tumor metastasis inhibition by CuE can be mainly
  ascribed to the impediments of tumor cell migration and invasion. Previous studies
  showed that CuE suppressed pancreatic tumor growth through cell cycle progression,
  apoptosis and proliferation inhibition. CuE also showed anti-prostate cancer activity
  by disrupting the actin and vimentin cytoskeleton. The potential reasons may be
  the different molecular mechanism in different cancer.


  An important finding of our study is that CuE inhibits tumor cell migration by impairing
  Arp2/3-dependent actin polymerization in breast cancer. Previous studies reported
  that CuE disturbed cytoskeleton in prostate cancer. Our immunofluorescence results
  showed that tumor cell branched actin polymerization and lamellipodia were impaired
  after CuE treatment. Arp3, a subunit of the Arp2/3 complex, is involved in actin
  polymerization and the formation of lamellipodia. We first showed, in present study,
  CuE decreased Arp3 and actin expression under low concentration. Previous studies
  revealed activated Rac1 stimulates actin polymerization through Arp2/3 complex.
  Our results demonstrated Rac1 activity was down-regulated by CuE. These findings
  suggested that CuE disturbed actin polymerization, cell migration and invasion through
  Arp2/3-dependent actin polymerization and further in vivo rescue studies in depth
  will be conducted later.


  FAK/MMP-involved pathway is essential for cancer invasion and metastasis. Tumor
  cell invasion is a multistep process, of which the key cascades include increased
  migration and increased protease secretion to allow dissemination from primary tumor
  sites. CuE was found to inhibit FAK and c-Src phosphorylation activity and decrease
  the expression of FAK/c-Src downstream proteins including Rac1, JNK, and c-Jun,
  which are key components of cell migration and invasion. MMP2 and MMP9 up-regulation
  can particularly enhance tumor cell metastatic potential in breast cancer. MMP-2
  and MMP-9 have been related to invasive behavior of tumors. On the other hand, TIMP-1
  and TIMP-2 inhibit their activity and are therefore considered to have inhibitory
  effect on tumor metastasis. In this study, CuE not only down-regulated MMP2, MMP9
  expression and decreased their activity but also up-regulated the expression of
  TIMP1 and TIMP2 in cell lysates and primary tumors. The results suggested the efficacy
  of Src/FAK/Rac1/MMP signaling pathway blockade by CuE for the inhibition tumor cell
  invasion and metastasis.


  In conclusion, our results implied CuE is a potential agent in inhibiting breast
  cancer metastasis by targeting tumor cell migration and invasion.
