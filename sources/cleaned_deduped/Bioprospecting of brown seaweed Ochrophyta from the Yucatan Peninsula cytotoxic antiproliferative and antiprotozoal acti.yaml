  In the Yucatan Peninsula coast, a large diversity of seaweed species are found,
  and recent studies have reported the presence of metabolites with pharmaceutical
  importance. In this study, a biological screening of brown seaweed extracts from
  Dictyota ciliolata, Padina sanctae-crucis, Sargassum fluitans, and Turbinaria tricostata
  was carried out. Their cytotoxicity and antiproliferative activities were evaluated
  by the sulforhodamine B assay on human embryonic kidney, human breast cancer, human
  prostate cancer, and human hepatic cancer cell lines. Seaweed extracts were also
  tested for their anti-trichomonal and anti-giardicidal properties. Fucan fractions
  were extracted using successive maceration with ethanol/water and freeze-dried.
  Organics extracts were obtained from ethanol residue from liquid–liquid fractionation.
  A total of four ethanol extracts, four fucan-rich fractions, four ethanolic extracts,
  and 12 organic fractions were obtained. Only the ethanolic extracts from Turbinaria
  tricostata and D. ciliolata were active against LNCaP. Interestingly, the activity
  found in the extracts from D. ciliolata and Turbinaria tricostata was maintained
  when both extracts were subjected to a liquid–liquid fractionation with hexane on
  the LNCaP cell line. The antiproliferative assays showed that both dichloromethane
  and ethanolic fractions from P. sanctae-crucis were active against MCF-7, with IC50
  of 26.1 and 29.8 μg mL−1, respectively. These species have been selected for further
  bio-guided fractionation and isolation of active compounds.







  The search for marine natural products has generated great interest for the pharmaceutical
  industry, which regards them as a new source of bioactive compounds with medicinal
  potential. In this context, seaweeds have attracted the attention of the pharmaceutical
  industry, due to the great diversity of species that are available, the ability
  to produce secondary metabolites with various pharmacological activities, and the
  ease of obtaining industrial crops. To date, more than 2,400 natural products with
  a wide diversity of chemical structures have been isolated mostly from tropical
  seaweeds. In particular, brown seaweeds have been also characterized for their secondary
  metabolites, terpene type, and phlorotannin pigments, and some of them have been
  reported to possess cytotoxic activity, antiproliferative, antimicrobial, antiparasitic,
  and/or antioxidant activities. Moreover, brown seaweed fucoidans, a family of sulfated
  polysaccharides containing fucose, sulfate, and uronic acids, have attracted attention
  due to their high bioactive properties as antibacterial, anticoagulant, antiviral,
  and anti-tumoral agents. Most recently, several patents on the extraction of high-value
  biologically active materials from seaweed have been published, but generally, the
  active components have not been fully characterized and they have not been produced
  using a whole plant approach. Therefore, the determination of whether such bioactive
  compounds can be isolated as co-products in a process yielding hydrocolloids, lipids,
  or other components from them is necessary as a possible feedstock for biorefinery.


  Extraction technology is critical for the complete use of seaweed raw materials
  with low consumption of solvents, reducing time, and with high yields at low costs.
  On this regard, extraction methods for fucans involve treatments with acid or base
  solutions, which leads to a possible degradation of other organic compounds, which
  may have potential applications in the pharmaceutical industry. However, in recent
  years, some authors established a methodology extraction of fucans using water and
  ethanol alone, without the previous use of acids or bases. Likewise, for the extraction
  of organic extracts, the used mixtures of dichloromethane/methanol or direct maceration
  give low yields and are not selective for particular compounds polarity. Currently,
  there is no methodology for extracting fucans and the organic extracts from the
  same plant material. This would bring advantages in screening studies and a more
  comprehensive use of brown seaweed products.


  In previous studies on brown seaweed from the Yucatan Peninsula, biological activity
  in the genus Dictyota, Sargassum, Padina, and Turbinaria has been reported. In this
  study, we evaluated cytotoxic, antiproliferative, and antiprotozoal activities of
  fucans and organic fractions from Dictyota ciliolata, Padina sanctae-crucis, Sargassum
  fluitans, and Turbinaria tricostata as part of our search for compounds with biological
  activity and to the integral use of seaweed from the Yucatan Peninsula. The objective
  of this work is to extract native fucans using a soft chemically modified technique,
  thus obtaining extracts and organic fractions of the same seaweed sample evaluating
  its activities with different biological assays. This kind of approach could be
  implemented in the extraction process to use the waste from one process as a feedstock
  in the next.






  The material collected consisted of two species from the Dictyotaceae: Dictyota
  ciliolata Sonder ex Kützing and Padina sanctae-crucis Børgesen and two species of
  Fucaceae: Sargassum fluitans Børgesen and Turbinaria tricostata E.S. Barton. All
  specimens were collected at the Caribbean coast of the Yucatan peninsula in Puerto
  Morelos during the winter of 2012. The seaweeds were centrifuged on site to remove
  excess seawater using a commercial portable centrifuge and stored in plastic bags
  on ice during transport to the laboratory. Once in the laboratory, samples were
  washed thoroughly with fresh water to remove salts, sand, and epiphytes and stored
  at −20 °C. Voucher specimens for all species were identified according to Wynne
  at the MEXU Herbarium.




  Native fucans were extracted with selective solvents by constant mechanical stirring
  at different temperature ranges according to the method described by Foley et al..
  Seaweeds previously stored were milled using a commercial blender. Subsequently,
  milled algae were mixed using ethanol extraction at room temperature for 12 h. After
  this time, another extraction was performed for another 12 h at 70 °C. The EtOH
  supernatants were kept at −4 °C for further use. Successive extraction of the solid
  residue with Milli-Q H2O was done, first at room temperature for 7 h, then at 70
  °C for 7 h, and later at 70 °C for 4 h. The resultant water fractions were treated
  with CaCl2 in order to precipitate alginates; after alginate removal, the resulting
  extract was rich in fucoidan. Dialysis was carried out over a 48-h period to decrease
  salinity using Milli-Q H2O changes every 12 h. Resultant fucans were freeze-dried
  and stored until required.

  2Cytotoxic activity by D. ciliolata and T. tricostata. 3Antiproliferative activity
  by P. sanctae-crucis. Preliminary fractionation was performed polar fractions by
  liquid–liquid chromatography: 4using a separating funnel and solvents of increasing
  polarity




  Liquid–liquid chromatography fractionation was carried out by means of a separating
  funnel. This is a standardized method widely used in chemistry for the separation
  of molecules making use of the partition coefficient of each molecule. Briefly,
  the ethanol supernatants were filtered and evaporated under vacuum by means of a
  rotary evaporator to obtain a dried extract. The ethanol extract was suspended in
  150 mL methanol–H2O and extracted by funnel separation using 300 mL and with 150
  mL of solvents of increasing polarity: hexane, dichloromethane, and ethyl acetate.




  Samples of each organic fraction were solubilized in dimethyl sulfoxide, or H2O/DMSO
  in the case of fucans, prior to be added to the appropriate culture medium and were
  stocked at a concentration of 10 mg mL−1.




  Giardia intestinalis strain IMSS:0696:1 was cultured in TYI-S-33 modified medium,
  supplemented with 10 % calf serum and bovine bile. Trichomonas vaginalis strain
  GT3 was cultured in TYI-S-33 medium, supplemented with 10 % bovine serum. In vitro
  growth susceptibility assays were performed using a method previously described.
  Briefly, stock solutions from each extract were added to microtubes containing 1.5
  mL of medium in order to reach concentrations of 0.5, 1, 5, and 10 μg mL−1. Subsequently,
  4 × 104 trophozoites mL−1 of Giardia lamblia or Trichomonas vaginalis were added
  to microtubes and incubated for 48 h at 37 ºC. At the end of this period, trophozoites
  were counted with a hemocytometer, and the inhibitory concentration was calculated
  by nonlinear fit. Experiments were carried out in triplicate and repeated at least
  twice. As the negative control, we used DMSO and metronidazole as positive control.




  The cell lines used were hepatocellular carcinoma-HB-8065), breast adenocarcinoma,
  prostate carcinoma, and a human cell embryonic kidney cell line from the ATCC. The
  cells were cultured in sterile Costar T75 flasks containing D-MEM medium or RPMI-1640,
  supplemented with fetal bovine serum, 100 U mL−1 penicillin G, and 100 μg mL−1 streptomycin
  at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5 % CO2.




  At 70–80 % confluence, cells were detached from the cultured flask by treatment
  with 0.05 % trypsin–EDTA, and a suspension of 1.5 × 104 cells mL−1 of viable cells
  was seeded in a 96-well microtiter plate and incubated for 24 h. When cells reached
  80–90 % confluence, the medium was replaced and cells were incubated with stock
  solutions of extracts serially diluted to reach concentrations of 50.0, 25.0, 12.5,
  and 6.25 μg mL−1. After 48 h of incubation, viability of the cell lines was evaluated
  by the sulforhodamine B method. The concentration of the extract that killed 50
  % of the cells was calculated by nonlinear fit. All concentrations were evaluated
  in duplicate, and each experiment was performed in triplicate. The selectivity index
  of each extract was calculated as the ratio of cytotoxicity on normal cells to cancer
  cells. It is generally considered that biological efficacy is not due to general
  toxicity when SI ≥ 10.




  In order to elucidate if the effect of extracts were directly correlated to suppression
  of cell proliferation, we evaluate the growth inhibition of extracts and fraction
  from the brown seaweed studied. Cells were cultured in 96-well plates at a concentration
  of 5 × 104 cells per well, after cultured at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5 % CO2.
  Once the cells reached 70 % confluence, the medium was replaced using same conditions
  as the cytotoxic assays, except that the medium was replaced with DMEM 10 % SFB
  to induce cellular proliferation. The growth inhibition of the cell lines was evaluated
  by the SRB method. The IG50 value, defined as the extract concentration that resulted
  in 50 % of cell growth inhibition, was calculated. All concentrations were evaluated
  in duplicate, and each experiment was performed in triplicate. In both assays, docetaxel
  was used as a positive control, while cells incubated only with 0.05 % of DMSO were
  used as a negative control. The optical density of the developed plates with SRB
  was read in a GloMax multi-detection system spectrophotometer at 450 nm.




  The chromatographic separation and analysis was carried out in a gas chromatography–mass
  spectrometry coupled to a mass selective detector model 5975B. Compounds were separated
  on an Ultra-1 capillary column. One microliter of the sample was injected into GC–MS
  using split mode. The injector temperature was 250 °C. The column temperature was
  programmed as follows: initial temperature at 100 °C for 4 min, 10 °C min−1 to 300
  °C, and 300 °C for 20 min. Mass detector conditions were electronic impact mode
  at 70 eV, source temperature 230 °C, scanning rate 1 scan s−1, mass acquisition
  range 20–600 am, and solvent delay 4 min. Carrier gas was helium at 1 mL min−1.
  Volatile components present in the seaweed fractions were identified by comparing
  their mass spectra using NIST Standard Reference Database.






  Yield of extracts and fractions obtained from the brown seaweed studied are shown
  in Table 1. In general, low polarity fraction yields were higher in all four seaweeds.
  The alga D. ciliolata produced the highest yield for the ethanol extract while T.
  tricostata yield higher fucans.





  The CC50 value is the concentration of the extract that killed 50 % of the cells
  during the assay. Extract activity was considered as: high, medium, and low as previously
  established by Moo-Puc et al.





  The cytotoxic activities of extracts and fractions from the brown seaweed against
  four cancer cell lines examined in this study are shown in Table 1. Our results
  suggest that only ethanolic extracts from D. ciliolata and T. tricostata had a high
  cytotoxic activity in the LNCaP cell line, while the ethanolic extracts from S.
  fluitans and P. sanctae-crucis showed moderate and low activity on the same line.
  Moderate activity was observed on cell line MCF-7 with D. ciliolata ethanol extract
  and in T. tricostata methanol extract, whereas low activity was found in P. sanctae-crucis
  and S. fluitans ethanolic extracts. Additionally, the hepatoma cell line Hep-G2
  showed a high resistance to all extracts tested, with reduced activity in D. ciliolata
  and T. tricostata extracts.


  Liquid–liquid fractionation of the ethanol extracts using hexane, dichloromethane,
  and ethyl acetate was performed in order to know the nature of the compounds responsible
  for the biological activity. When D. ciliolata ethanol extract was fractionated,
  we observed that the cytotoxic activity of the original extract remained in the
  nonpolar hexane fraction and to a lesser extent in the low polar dichloromethane
  fraction. The hexane fraction of D. ciliolata showed cytotoxic activity toward LNCaP
  cell line and moderate activity on Hep-G2 and MCF-7 cell lines. Turbinaria tricostata
  extracts maintained its cytotoxic activity only in the hexane and ethyl acetate
  fractions toward LNCaP and MCF-7 cell lines. None of the fractions of P. sanctae-crucis
  and S. fluitans showed cytotoxic activity in the human cancer cell lines tested.
  Overall, a moderate selectivity of the ethanol extracts and organic fractions from
  the four brown seaweed studied was found. None of the fucan fractions from the four
  brown seaweed studied showed cytotoxic activity to a concentration of 500 μg mL–1.




  The antiproliferative activity from four ethanolic extracts is summarized in Table
  2. Ethanolic extract from P. sanctae-crucis had high antiproliferative activity
  against MCF-7 and low activity on LNCaP cell lines, while moderate activity was
  found in the ethanolic extract of D. ciliolata on LNCaP cell line. The extract from
  S. fluitans showed low activity toward cell lines MCF-7 and LNCaP. None of the extract
  or fractions of T. tricostata showed antiproliferative activity in the cell lines
  studied at a concentration ;100 μg mL–1. When the fractions obtained from the four
  extracts were subjected to the antiproliferative assay, only the dichloromethane
  fraction of P. sanctae-crucis kept its antiproliferative activity for breast cancer
  lines. Hexane and ethyl acetate fractions from the same species show low activity
  toward MCF-7 and LNCaP. Moderate antiproliferative activity was also observed in
  the hexane fraction of D. ciliolata extract toward prostate cancer line. Fucan fractions
  from the brown seaweed studied did not show significant antiproliferative activity.





  The IG50 value is the extract concentration that resulted in 50 % of cell growth
  inhibition during the assay. Extract activity was considered as: high, medium, and
  low as previously established by Moo-Puc et al.





  The activity was tested in two clinically important human parasites, but results
  show that none of the extracts or fractions had significant activity as low as 13
  μg mL−1.




  The constituent compounds from the three most active fractions were analyzed by
  means of gas chromatography. Figure 2 illustrates the fingerprint of the three fractions
  with higher activity: cytotoxic and antiproliferative. The chromatograms show that
  D. ciliolata has five compounds, followed by P. sanctae-crucis with eight compounds,
  and finally T. tricostata with nine compounds. From the 22 peaks present in the
  three chromatograms, only four compounds were identified by comparison of their
  mass spectra with the NIST5 database: Hexadecanoic acid ethyl ester was present
  in all three fractions and in greater proportion in P. sanctae-crucis fraction;
  pentadecanoic acid methyl ester and ethyl ester of-9-octadecenoic were detected
  in P. sanctae-crucis; while the compound 6, 10, 14-trimethyl-2-pentadecanone was
  only identified in the D. ciliolata fraction. Two common unknown peaks were detected
  in both P. sanctae-crucis and T. tricostata.



  Chromatograms obtained from A hexane active fraction from D. ciliolata, B hexane
  active fraction from Turbinaria tricostata, and C dichloromethane active fraction
  from P. sanctae-crucis. GC–MS: ultra-1 capillary column. The injector temperature
  was 250 °C. The column temperature was programmed as follows: initial temperature
  at 100 °C for 4 min, 10 °C min−1 to 300 °C, 300 °C for 20 min. Hexadecanoic acid
  ethyl ester was present in all three fractions; pentadecanoic acid methyl ester
  and ethyl ester of-9-octadecenoic were detected in P. sanctae-crucis; 6, 10, 14-trimethyl-2-pentadecanone
  was only identified in the D. ciliolata fraction. Two common unknown peaks were
  detected in both P. sanctae-crucis and T. tricostata




  Most of the published literatures on the screening compounds from seaweeds evaluate
  organic or aqueous extracts separately, focusing basically toward a main type of
  compounds and mainly using extraction by maceration. In this paper, our proposal
  evaluated a simple protocol for extraction of both polysaccharide-rich extracts
  and other usable organic extracts. The yields for organic extracts reported in the
  literature are ∼8 % in Dictyota, ∼2.5 % in Padina, ∼2 % in Sargassum, and ∼2 % in
  Turbinaria. Fucan yields are quite variable depending on the species from which
  they were extracted and the method used for extraction. Nevertheless, previous studies
  suggest that generally fucans have a yield ranging between 3 and 12 %. In this study,
  comparable yields were obtained for both organic extracts and fucans.


  On the other hand, ethanol extracts from D. ciliolata and T. tricostata showed high
  cytotoxic activity, whereas ethanolic extract of P. sanctae-crucis had high antiproliferative
  activity, demonstrating that cytotoxic and antiproliferative assays are not directly
  related. These results could suggest that the main pharmacological mechanism of
  each extract is different; thus, D. ciliolata and T. tricostata compounds may be
  related to necrosis or apoptosis, while P. sanctae-crucis compounds may be responsible
  for the antiproliferative activity by inhibiting cell cycle.


  Liquid–liquid chromatography led us to identify the polarity of the active compounds
  present in the crude extracts of the brown seaweed studied. The hexane fractions
  of D. ciliolata and T. tricostata had an effect for prostate cancer, whereas dichloromethane
  fraction from P. sanctae-crucis was the most active toward breast cancer. These
  data demonstrate the nonpolar nature of the active compounds in all the three fractions.


  Isolated diterpenes from the genus Dictyota have been reported to exert cytotoxic
  and protective DNA damage activities. This genus has been extensively investigated
  from a chemical viewpoint and is regarded as a rich source of these compounds. Moreover,
  from D. ciliolata, prenylated guaiane and xenicane like-type diterpenes have been
  isolated. However, there is no information indicating cytotoxic activity of these
  compounds from this species. We are currently isolating and elucidating the compounds
  present in the hexane fraction of D. ciliolata. Although we do not know at the moment
  the chemical compounds responsible for the observed activity of the species from
  which we isolated some of the bioactive chemical compounds, these are related to
  the same genera that have been previously studied. In particular for the genus Dictyota,
  diterpenes with cytotoxic properties have been described. Nevertheless, the pharmacological
  mechanism by which guaiane and xenicane like-type diterpenes exert their cytotoxic
  effect is not known; therefore, pharmacological studies on cell lines using these
  compounds are needed.


  Previous studies with the genus Turbinaria have isolated compounds with potent cytotoxic
  activity such as turbinaric acid and oxygenated sterols that can be responsible
  for the cytocidal effect observed in this study. To our knowledge, there are not
  reports in the literature on biological and/or phytochemistry of T. tricostata.


  In relation to the genus Padina, very few studies have been published regarding
  biological activity and chemical composition. Two previous studies with Padina pavonica
  indicate the presence of oxygenated sterols and diterpenes with cytotoxic active
  compounds. The compound 24(R)-hydroproxy-24-vinylcholesterol is an oxygenated sterol
  previously isolated from other species of Turbinaria and Padina. This is a potent
  cytotoxic compound, which main pharmacological mechanism is the induction of apoptosis
  and it has been described for the brown algae Nizamuddinia zanardinii. The biological
  activity observed in T. tricostata and P. sanctae-crucis extracts could be related
  to the presence of this compound; however, these should be studied further.


  In our results, we showed antiproliferative activity of the dichloromethane fraction;
  therefore, it is important to isolate compounds from this fraction to identify the
  main compound responsible for such activity. As to the chemical composition of the
  three most active fractions, we observed similarities from the GC–MS spectra, especially
  in the presence of fatty acid esters. It is well-known that seaweed produce mostly
  saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons. However, the chromatograms and mass data
  fragmentation studies indicate that other type of compounds may also be present
  in these species. In fact, from the chemotaxonomical point of view, it is known
  from the literature that the genus Dictyota produces mainly diterpenes, Turbinaria
  oxygenated sterols and sterols, and Padina contains both types of compounds. In
  this study, we performed a preliminary fingerprint on the chemical composition of
  the three most active fractions of D. ciliolata, T. tricostata, and P. sanctae-crucis,
  in order to learn more on the chemical compounds present in these species and lay
  the groundwork for further studies and biotechnological applications.


  In conclusion, these results confirm that the methodology proposed is a simple,
  selective, and a suitable alternative for obtaining both fucans and organic fractions
  from same plant material. The versatility and assurance to fully utilize biomass
  to screening and biological testing of organic extracts and fucans must be studied
  in detail in order to optimize the recovery of other useful products for possible
  application. Therefore, further studies are needed in order to evaluate the possibility
  of using up to 100 % of the biomass available of these or other abundant brown seaweeds
  in tropical coastal areas. Additionally, we propose a bio-guided isolation of the
  compounds responsible for the biological activity present, with the purpose of being
  used as pharmaceutical entities or for the standardization of herbal medicines.
