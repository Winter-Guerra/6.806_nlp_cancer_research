  Overexpression of cyclooxygenase 2 and uncontrolled wingless and Int-signaling pathway
  have long been suggested to play crucial roles in colorectal cancer. Studies show
  that selective COX2 inhibitors possess great potential as chemopreventive agents
  for colon cancer. Recent studies suggest that targeting COX2 and epidermal growth
  factor receptor may provide better therapeutic strategy than inhibiting either single
  target and that this may alleviate the problem of COX2 inhibitor-associated side
  effects. Therefore, there have been intensive efforts to develop novel dietary substances
  that target COX2 and EGFR activation. Fisetin is a naturally occurring flavonoid
  commonly found in various vegetables and fruits. We found that the treatment of
  COX2-overexpressing HT29 human colon cancer cells with fisetin resulted in induction
  of apoptosis, downregulation of COX2 protein expression without affecting COX1 and
  inhibited the secretion of prostaglandin E2. Treatment of cells with fisetin also
  inhibited Wnt-signaling activity through downregulation of β-catenin and T cell
  factor 4 and decreased the expression of target genes such as cyclin D1 and matrix
  metalloproteinase 7. Fisetin treatment of cells also inhibited the activation of
  EGFR and nuclear factor-kappa B. Finally, the formation of colonies in soft agar
  was suppressed by fisetin treatment. Taken together, we provide evidence that the
  plant flavonoid fisetin can induce apoptosis and suppress the growth of colon cancer
  cells by inhibition of COX2- and Wnt/EGFR/NF-κB-signaling pathways. We suggest that
  fisetin could be a useful agent for prevention and treatment of colon cancer. '
