  Salvia officinalis L. can be found worldwide and its leaves are commonly used as
  ingredient in food industry. Sage essential oil is applied in the treatment of a
  range of diseases and has been shown to possess different biological activities.
  The objectives of our research were to study the effects of environment on crop,
  chemical composition and anticancer activity on S. officinalis essential oil. Sage
  was cultivated at eighteen experimental sites in south-central Italy in different
  growing environments. The essential oils, extracted by hydrodistillation, were analyzed
  by GC and CG/MS. Results show that the main components were Î±-thujone, camphor,
  borneol, Î³-muurolene and sclareol for all the samples, but the percentages of these
  compounds varied depending on environmental factors such as altitude, water availability
  and pedo-climatic conditions. The growth-inhibitory and proapoptotic effects of
  the eighteen sage essential oils were evaluated in three human melanoma cell lines,
  A375, M14, and A2058.'
