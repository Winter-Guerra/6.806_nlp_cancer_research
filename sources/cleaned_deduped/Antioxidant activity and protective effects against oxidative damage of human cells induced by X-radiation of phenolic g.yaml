text: '


  The antioxidant and radioprotective effects of the phenolic glycosides from Capsicum
  annuum L. were examined. There were: sinapoyl-E-glucoside, quercetin-3-O-rhamnoside-7-O-glucoside,
  quercetin-3-O-rhamnoside and luteolin-7-O--glucoside. To the best of our knowledge,
  this is the first study to assay these compounds for their radioprotective effect
  on human cell lymphocytes in response to oxidative damage induced by X radiation
  and their antioxidant abilities. Investigated compounds showed weaker antiradical
  activities, but their radioprotective potentials were higher than those of their
  aglycones. Quercetin-3-O-rhamnoside showed the highest radioprotective activity.
  Furthermore, quercetin and luteolin derivatives, in contrast to free aglycones,
  were not cytotoxic against human lymphocytes for all concentrations tested. The
  best correlation between radioprotective and antiradical activities of the investigated
  compounds was observed in the relationship to O2 generated using the NADH/PMS method.
  Thus, we propose that superoxide radical scavenging activity is a useful method
  for screening for compounds with promising radioprotective potential.'
