  Fruit and vegetable consumption is associated at the population level with a protective
  effect against colorectal cancer. Phenolic compounds, especially abundant in berries,
  are of interest due to their putative anticancer activity. After consumption, however,
  phenolic compounds are subject to digestive conditions within the gastrointestinal
  tract that alter their structures and potentially their function. However, the majority
  of phenolic compounds are not efficiently absorbed in the small intestine and a
  substantial portion pass into the colon. We characterized berry extracts produced
  by in vitro-simulated upper intestinal tract digestion and subsequent fecal fermentation.
  These extracts and selected individual colonic metabolites were then evaluated for
  their putative anticancer activities using in vitro models of colorectal cancer,
  representing the key stages of initiation, promotion and invasion. Over a physiologically-relevant
  dose range, the digested and fermented extracts demonstrated significant anti-genotoxic,
  anti-mutagenic and anti-invasive activity on colonocytes. This work indicates that
  phenolic compounds from berries undergo considerable structural modifications during
  their passage through the gastrointestinal tract but their breakdown products and
  metabolites retain biological activity and can modulate cellular processes associated
  with colon cancer.

  The etiology of colorectal cancer, the fourth most common cause of cancer related
  mortality globally, has strong associations with diet , . Given the inverse correlation
  of fruit and vegetable consumption with colorectal cancer incidence it is unsurprising
  that bioactive phytochemicals within these foods are of interest with regard to
  their anticancer properties , . Phenolic compounds are abundant in soft fruit such
  as berries, and include anthocyanins, flavonols, flavan-3-ols, ellagitannins, proanthocyanidins,
  hydroxycinnamates and phenolic acids . These isolated phytochemicals or whole berry
  extracts have been reported to exert putative anticancer effects in colonocytes
  both in vitro and in vivo , , . For example, commercial bilberry extracts decreased
  proliferation of HT29 adenocarcinoma cells in vitro , in tumor cells in F344 rats
  treated with azoxymethane  and in tumor cells from biopsies in colorectal cancer
  patients .


  Berry phenolic compounds typically occur as glycosides with, for example, anthocyanins
  comprising a diversity of conjugates including glucosides, galactosides, rutinosides,
  xylorutinosides and sambubiosides. Such conjugated glycosides are, for the main
  part, not absorbed in the small intestine but those with a glucose moiety may be
  subject to deconjugation, catalysed by membrane-bound lactase phlorizin hydrolase
  in the intestinal epithelium and/or soluble β-glucosidases, producing aglycones
  which are more lipophilic and therefore absorbed by passive diffusion , . However,
  the majority of phenolic compounds are not efficiently absorbed in the small intestine  and
  a substantial portion pass into the colon . Once in the large intestine, these components
  are subject to degradation by the colonic microflora forming catabolites including
  simple phenolic and aromatic acids , . Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that
  the colonic epithelium is in direct contact with both the parent phenolic compounds
  and their degradation products .


  Generally, studies on putative anticancer activity have used in vitro colonocyte
  cell models with extracts rich in phenolic compounds or purified components from
  berries and have not considered the effects of their in vivo metabolites. The initial
  aim of this study was to produce and characterize extracts derived from raspberries
  strawberries and blackcurrants that were more representative of the components to
  which the colonic epithelium is exposed in vivo. This involved a combination of
  in vitro digestion and subsequent fecal fermentation of berry extracts to mimic
  the physiological changes encountered during passage through the gastrointestinal
  tract. The resultant extracts were then evaluated for biological activity using
  in vitro models representing key stages in colorectal cancer, namely, initiation,
  promotion and invasion.






  DMEM and fetal bovine serum were obtained from Gibco Life Technologies Ltd. All
  other chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Company Ltd unless otherwise specified.




  Raspberries and strawberries were obtained from local farmers, around Dundee, UK,
  while blackcurrants were acquired from Bradenham Hall, Norfolk, UK. No specific
  permits were required for the described field studies as these berries were part
  of a larger crop grown by a farmer under contract to the James Hutton Institute
  and therefore not a field study, no permissions were required. The location was
  not protected in any way and no endangered or protected species were involved. Phenolic-rich
  extracts of the berries were obtained using the method of McDougall et al. . In
  vitro digestion of the berries was modified from the method by Gil-Izquierdo et
  al.  as described previously . Briefly, extract was obtained from the different
  berry species by homogenising berries with an equal volume of solvent glacial acetic
  acid in acetonitrile) in a Waring blender, the homogenate filtered through muslin,
  and the filtrate subjected to rotary evaporation to remove the solvent. This extract
  then underwent an in vitro procedure that simulates the digestive process. Two sequential
  steps were performed; an initial pepsin/HCl step to simulate gastric conditions,
  and bile salts/pancreatin digestion to simulate conditions of the small intestine.
  This ‘colon-available’ extract underwent solid phase extraction to remove phenolics
  from bile salts present in the samples. Total anthocyanins were measured using a
  pH differential technique. The extract was then diluted in distilled water to a
  concentration of 500 µg gallic acid equivalents as measured using the Folin-Ciocalteau
  method and dried in a speed-vac. Berry extract was stored at −20°C until use.




  The in vitro digested berry extracts were subjected to in vitro fermentation with
  human fecal samples to produce a sample representative of what may be present in
  the colon  Basal medium was prepared to sustain the fecal inoculum, L-cysteine HCl
  ). A further 1500 mL of water was added with stirring. Once all components had dissolved
  completely the medium was dispensed in 135 mL aliquots into glass bottles and autoclaved.


  The fermentation vessels were maintained at 37°C, sterile medium added and nitrogen
  gas was pumped through the vessels to maintain anaerobic conditions. The pH was
  maintained at ~6.6 using the inserted pH electrodes and addition of acid and base
  solutions.


  IVD berry extract was added to the basal medium in separate fermentation vessels
  and a control vessel constructed without berry extract. Fecal samples were collected
  with the prior approval of the ethics committee of the University of Reading. This
  experiment was carried out using fecal samples from three different volunteers.
  After obtaining verbal informed consent, a standard questionnaire to collect information
  regarding the health status, drugs use, clinical anamnesis, and lifestyle was administrated
  before the donor was asked to provide a fecal sample. The University of Reading
  ethics committee exempted this study from review because no donors were involved
  in any intervention and waived the need for written consent due to the fact the
  samples received were not collected by means of intervention. Fresh fecal samples
  were provided by 3 apparently healthy individuals. Within 2 hours of collection,
  the samples were combined and 10% fecal slurry prepared using sterile PBS. Fecal
  slurry, 15 mL, was added to each of the fermentation vessels and allowed to mix
  thoroughly with the medium for 5 min and the pH adjusted accordingly. At time T
  = 0 h, 6 mL of fecal slurry/basal medium was removed from each vessel, ultracentrifuged
  for 2×10 min at 10,000 g and the supernatant filtered through 0.22 µm filters before
  being aliquoted into Eppendorf tubes. Sampling was repeated at T = 24 hours and
  all aliquots stored at −80°C.




  Berry extracts corresponding to 40 µg of gallic acid equivalents were analyzed on
  a LCQ-DECA system comprised of Surveyor autosampler, pump, a photodiode array detector
  and a Thermo-Finnigan ion trap mass spectrometer as outlined by Coates et al. .
  Phenolic components were identified on the basis of a combination of co-chromatography
  with reference compounds, retention times, and absorbance and mass spectra. Classes
  of polyphenols were quantified against relevant standards: hydroxycinnamates as
  5-O-caffeoylquinic acid equivalents; flavonols as quercetin-3-O-glucoside equivalents,
  anthocyanins as cyanidin-3-O-glucoside equivalents; ellagitannins and ellagic acids
  as ellagic acid equivalents and others as catechin equivalents. Parent compounds
  in the berry IVD extracts were analysed by LC-MS as described by Borges et al.  and
  phenolic acids in fermentates by GC-MS according to procedures of Roowi et al. .




  Bermudez-Soto et al.  estimated that consumption of approximately 640 mg of phenolic
  compounds would result in colonic concentrations in the region of 160 mg/l. The
  dose range in this study equated maximally to 50 mg/l and as such is physiologically
  relevant. For experimentation, the IVD extracts were reconstituted in growth medium
  to a concentration of 500 µg/mL GAE, and subsequently diluted to produce the dose
  range of 50, 25, 12.5, 6.25, and 3.125 µg/mL GAE. During experimentation cells were
  pre-incubated with each concentration of berry extract for 24 hours at 37°C, 5%
  CO2, 95% humidity. Fermented berry extracts were diluted 1/10 v/v with PBS prior
  to testing. Individual phenolic acids were used at a similar concentrations to those
  phenolic acids detected in the fermented berry extracts by LC-MS analysis, a common
  range was selected for comparison purposes namely, 1 and 5 or 5 and 10 µg/mL depending
  on the concentration of the individual phenolic acid in the fermented extract. Twenty
  four hours was selected as the exposure time for all in vitro studies as it is generally
  considered to reflect the average colonic transit time, after pre-incubation with
  treatments the cells were washed and harvested with trypsin prior to use in the
  various assays.










  Given that the colonic epithelium maybe in direct contact with both parent phenolic
  compounds and their degradation products  the bioactivity of berry extracts was
  assessed using colonocyte cell-based assays that represent early and late stage
  events in carcinogenesis, namely initiation ,  and invasion , . Cell lines were
  used as models for colorectal cancer, namely HT29 human colorectal adenocarcinoma
  cell line for anti-genotoxicity/genotoxicity, mutagenicity studies and HT115 a human
  colon carcinoma cell line for matrigel invasion studies. The HT29, HT115 and MRC5
  human lung fibroblast-like cells were obtained from the European Collection of Cell
  Cultures, Salisbury, UK and were cultured as described by Coates et al. . HT29 cells
  were a gift from Professor Bill Kauffman, University of North Carolina, USA and
  were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS.






  Cytotoxicity of the berry extracts on HT29 cells treated for 24 hours was determined
  using the MTT-2,5-diphen​yltetrazoliumbromide) colorimetric assay to assess cell
  viability in accordance with the method described by Coates et al. . The experiment
  was repeated independently three times for each treatment and the mean results expressed
  as % cell survival normalized to biological control.




  The effect of the IVD berry extracts and fermented berry extract on colonocyte DNA
  damage was determined using the Comet assay according to the method described previously
  . HT29 cells were pre-incubated with the various berry extracts for 24 h. The anti-genotoxic
  potential of the extract was assessed by treating pre-incubated HT29 cells with
  hydrogen peroxide. To determine any genotoxic effects of the berry extract, pre-incubated
  cells were treated with PBS instead of H2O2. Each experiment was performed independently
  3 times and presented as mean % tail DNA normalised to control.




  Invasion of tumour cells through the basement membrane is an important step in the
  metastasis process. Invasion itself involves multiple stages including degradation
  of the extracellular matrix, adhesion to and migration through the basement membrane.
  The invasion assay was conducted as described previously . Briefly, HT115 cells
  were incubated with medium containing the various extracts tested for 24 h prior
  to experimentation and then seeded on to Matrigel™ coated Boyden chambers and allowed
  to invade for 24 h in response to chemo-attractant factor secreted by MRC 5 cells
  grown in the basolateral compartment of the boyden chamber. Growth medium was removed
  from the insert and cells were fixed in 70% v/v ethanol for 30 min prior to staining
  with haematoxylin. The number of invasive and non-invasive cells were counted in
  5 random fields of view at x 20 magnification using the Kromascan Meteor 2 software,
  and the percentage invasion calculated. Each experiment was repeated independently
  3 times for each treatment and expressed as % invasion normalised to control.




  This assay used HT29 cells, which are HT29 cells transfected with a construct of
  17 G-bases inside the coding sequence for the neo gene, which codes for resistance
  to the antibiotic neomycin. This insertion deactivates the gene and the cells become
  susceptible to neomycin, which can be reversed if a frameshift mutation occurs.
  The antibiotic geneticin, an analogue of neomycin, prevents cells that lack resistance
  from replicating, and thus from forming colonies. Fecal water, the aqueous phase
  of the fecal stream, has been shown to cause a 2–3 fold increase in frameshift mutations
  in HT29 cells. In this assay, fecal water is used as a biological control to induce
  a frameshift mutation, reverting cells to G418 resistance. The acridine mutagen
  ICR 191 induces frameshift mutations specifically at guanine bases and was used
  in this assay as a positive control . The protective effect of berry extracts against
  fecal water-induced mutations was assessed. Fecal water was prepared as described
  by Boyd et al.  from a single male donor after written informed consent had been
  obtained and prior to provision of the stool sample, with the approval of the University
  of Ulster ethical committee.


  HT29 cells were seeded into 6-well tissue culture plates at 1.5×104 cells/well and
  incubated for 24 h at 37°C with 5% CO2 and 95% humidity. Growth medium was removed
  from all wells, IVD berry extracts and fermented berry extracts added to the test
  plates; growth medium was replenished in the control plate then incubated for 24
  h. Medium was removed from all wells and the following treatments were added. Serum-free
  growth medium was used as a negative control, ICR 191 at 1 µg/mL in serum-free growth
  medium and fecal water were used as positive controls. Fecal water was added to
  each well in the test plate, and both plates were incubated for 1 h at 37°C with
  5% CO2 and 95% humidity. Fecal water and controls were removed and the cells harvested
  using 0.25% trypsin-EDTA. Cells were disaggregated by needle aspiration in growth
  medium and counted using a Vi-CELL counter. Cells were seeded into Petri dishes
  and 8 mL growth medium was added. Four dishes per treatment were seeded to be grown
  with/without G418 in duplicate. Cells were incubated for 24 h and G418 was added
  to half the plates. The medium was refreshed every 3 days. Whereas cells grown without
  G418 were stained after 7–10 days, cells grown with G418 were grown for up to 3
  weeks. Cells were washed with PBS and fixed in 100% methanol for 5 min, the methanol
  removed and left to dry. The cells were stained with Giemsa stain for 15 min. The
  stain was gently rinsed off and the dishes were left to dry overnight. Colonies
  were counted and the mutation frequency was calculated for each plate using: Colony
  forming efficiency, mutation frequency and relative mutation frequency:


  Each experiment was performed in duplicate for each treatment, and repeated three
  times independently and the results expressed as mean RMF.




  The mean of each data set was used for statistical analysis. The Shapiro-Wilk test
  was used to test for normality. Analysis of variance was applied to test for significant
  differences between means using ANOVA, Dunnett T and T3 tests. Four-way comparisons
  were performed between berry types to test for significance using Bonferroni. Significance
  was accepted at p;0.05. Analysis was carried out using SPSS.






  The levels of individual phenolic compounds in the berry extracts pre- and post-IVD
  samples were analysed by LC-MS and the data obtained is summarized in Tables S1,
  S2, and S3 and Figure S1. The most abundant components in raspberry extracts were
  the ellagitannins, sanguiin H-10 and lambertianin C and the anthocyanin cyanidin-3-O-sophoroside.
  The strawberry extracts contained mainly anthocyanins and ellagitannins with smaller
  amounts of hydroxycinnamate derivatives and flavonols, whereas blackcurrant was
  dominated by four main anthocyanins which made up ~70% of the total phenol content.


  The recovery of phenolic components after IVD followed patterns which have been
  outlined previously . Anthocyanins were generally less stable and the total anthocyanin
  content decreased in all three berry extracts post-IVD. However, there was no clear
  relationship between either the structure of the anthocyanidin aglycone or the glycosyl
  group and the stability of the anthocyanin to IVD. The stability of individual components
  also differed between berry extracts and stability appears to be dependent on the
  overall phenolic composition of each extract as suggested previously .


  Overall, the pattern of recovery of ellagitannins suggested breakdown. Ellagitannins
  in strawberry and raspberry showed differential stability with larger components
  being reduced in content whereas the levels of smaller components were either increased
  or maintained. This most likely reflects the well-documented breakdown of larger
  ellagitannins in slightly alkaline conditions through loss of ellagic acid after
  lactonization of a hexahydroxydiphenoyl group  yielding smaller ellagitannins .
  Flavonol components were generally more stable to IVD and actually increased in
  relative yield presumably due to reductions in other components. Hydroxycinnamate
  derivatives were also more stable to IVD with e.g. a feruloyl-O-hexoside in strawberry
  increasing substantially.




  LC-MS analysis established that phenolic compounds present at the start of the fermentation
  were absent after a 24 h fecal incubation while the levels of simpler aromatic components
  increased in the fermented extracts. The main catabolites that increased significantly
  in most of the extracts were phenylacetic acid, 3-(phenyl)propionic acid, 4-hydroxybenzoic
  acid and 4′-hydroxyphenylacetic acid. There were some suggestions of berry-specific
  products as, for example, 3, 4-dihydroxybenzoic acid was only identified in the
  fermentates from black currant.




  No cytotoxic activity was observed for any of the IVD berry extracts compared to
  media control. Further no anti-proliferative effects were observed as determined
  by growth curve and cell cycle analysis in accordance with methods described by
  McCann et al. . All the fermented berry extracts were cytotoxic when used neat but
  notably were 25–50% less cytotoxic than the control fermentate. A 1:10 dilution
  was selected for all experiments as it represented the lowest dilution tested at
  which berry fermentates and control fermentate had no significant difference in
  cytotoxicity. The individual phenolics identified in IVD fermentate exerted no cytotoxicity
  when tested at physiologically relevant concentrations compared to the media control.

  When measured by the Comet assay all IVD berry extracts above 6.25 µg/mL GAE exerted
  significant dose dependent anti-genotoxic effects on H2O2–challenged HT29 cells
  with no evidence of genotoxicity when compared to the media control. Overall, strawberry
  and blackcurrant IVD extracts reduced DNA damage more effectively than raspberry.
  Raspberry extract at maximal concentration decreased the % tail DNA from around
  50% in H2O2–challenged HT29 cells to about 15%, whereas strawberry and blackcurrant
  treatment reduced levels to approximately half that value.


  All berry fermentates exhibited significant anti-genotoxic activity decreasing %
  tail DNA to ~30% compared to the control fermentate with no berry extract. The total
  phenol levels for the berry fermentates ranged from 12–16 µg/mL GAE and the observed
  reduction in tail DNA was comparable in magnitude to that reported for IVD berry
  extracts at 12.5 µg GAE/mL. Figure 3C indicates that the individual phenolic compounds
  tested had no genotoxicity activity and decreased H2O2 – induced DNA damage by ~30%
  but only tyrosol and 4′-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, reached significance.






  Figure 3.  The anti-mutagenic effects of various types of berry extracts against
  fecal water-induced frameshift mutations in HT29 cells.


  (A) Effects of IVD berry extracts, berry fermentates. Data presented as mean relative
  mutation frequency of 3 independent experiments + SD. One-way ANOVA and Dunnett
  T test,  p&lt;0.05, significance is compared to fecal water control for A and against
  control fermentate FW in B. Phenol levels for berry fermentates were raspberry 15.5,
  strawberry 13.9 and blackcurrant 12.4 µg/mL GAE.





  IVD berry extracts and fermented berry extracts did not display any mutagenic activity.
  ICR 191 and fecal water challenge both induced frameshift mutations in HT29 resulting
  in an increase in relative mutation frequency of ~80%. Given the biological relevance
  of fecal water , it was selected in preference to the chemical mutagen ICR 191 as
  the challenge agent for use in the study.


  All IVD berry extracts exhibited significant anti-mutagenic activity at all concentrations
  tested compared to fecal water, but there was no significant difference between
  the efficacy of the individual IVD berry extracts. The berry fermentates also induced
  significant reductions in RMF post-fecal water challenge, compared to untreated
  fermentate. A maximum reduction in RMF of 46% was observed with the fermented raspberry
  extract and, as observed for the IVD extracts, there was no significant difference
  in the efficacy of different fermentates.




  Twenty four hour pre-incubation with IVD berry extracts inhibited invasion of HT115
  cells in the matrigel invasion assay. A significant dose-dependent anti-invasive
  effect was observed for blackcurrant, strawberry and raspberry when compared to
  the media control. All invasion data for IVD berry extracts was normalized to the
  invasion rate of the relevant media control and were comparable to previously reported
  values . Similarly all berry fermentates exhibited significant anti-invasive effects
  reducing invasion to 40% of their respective untreated control. Again there were
  no significant differences in the magnitude of effect observed between the berry
  fermentates. Furthermore, it is interesting to note that the reduction in the invasion
  of HT115 cells for both the IVD berry extracts and berry fermentates occurred with
  no change to the basal level of migration for the HT115 cells indicating that the
  anti-invasive effect was unlikely to be related to cell motility, but rather adhesion
  or membrane degradation.

  cells.

  + SD, One-way ANOVA and Dunnett T test,  p&lt;0.05, significance is compared to
  media control for A and against control fermentate in B. Values are expressed as
  % cell invasion normalised to control. Berry extracts had no effect on migration
  of HT115 cells. Phenol levels for berry fermentates were raspberry 15.5, strawberry
  13.9, blackcurrant 12.4 µg/mL GAE.





  Phenolic compounds in the diet undergo extensive modification by mammalian enzymes
  and the gut microbiota during their transit through the human body . The implication
  of such metabolism on the bioactivity of berry polyphenols has not been systematically
  investigated. Consequently we subjected berry extracts to in vitro digestive and
  fermentative processes and used a physiologically-relevant dose range with a 24
  hour exposure to test bioactivity using in vitro models representing key stages
  in colon carcinogenesis. Where significant effects were observed for the IVD extracts,
  the correspondent berry fermentates also exhibited chemoprotective activity, as
  did some of the individual phenolic compounds. Furthermore, digested and fermented
  extracts of equivalent phenolic content exerted an effect of similar magnitude in
  the bioassays, suggesting that products generated from in vitro digestion and fermentation
  of whole berries showed similar chemoprotective properties.


  The three berry extracts used in this study contained distinct and characteristic
  phenolic profiles. After IVD, certain components were depleted. In general, anthocyanins
  were depleted during the IVD process and this is in agreement with previous studies
  on pomegranate, raspberry, chokeberry and blackberry juices , , , . The effect of
  in vitro digestion on flavonols is less well studied: generally they were more stable
  during the digestive process with the recoveries of flavonols in strawberry and
  blackberry extracts either increasing or remaining constant. Recoveries of the ellagitannins,
  sanguiin H-6, sanguiin H-10, and lambertinian C were similar to those previously
  reported . Nevertheless, the recoveries of phenolic compounds after IVD were dependent
  on the type and composition of the individual berry extract and no general model
  for phenolic stability after IVD can be proposed. This makes it all the more relevant
  that digestion studies are carried out.


  It is clear that both the digestive and fermentation processes altered the polyphenol
  composition relative to the original extract and thus reinforces the importance
  of testing physiologically-relevant polyphenol breakdown products rather than isolated
  parent compounds. The phenolic metabolites derived from colonic fermentation of
  berry components may accumulate to sufficient levels to play important roles in
  the colon but can be reabsorbed into general circulation and affect other processes
  . For example, the urolithins being microbiota-derived catabolites of ellagitannins
  and ellagic acid are more effective than the parent compounds with respect to inhibition
  of the Wnt signaling pathway  and Nf-κB mediated anti-inflammatory activity . It
  is, therefore, of interest to note that both the digested and fermented berry extracts
  were effective in protecting against DNA damage and frame-shift mutations caused
  by exogenous challenge agents indicating that activity was retained after bacterial
  fermentation. Furthermore, individual pure phenolic compounds representing bacterial
  fermentation catabolites, namely tyrosol and 4′-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, exhibited
  significant anti-genotoxic activity. Similar to the trends observed for reduction
  of DNA damage, all the digested and fermented berry extracts exerted a significant
  anti-mutagenic activity against a relevant biological challenge , again demonstrating
  the preservation of bioactivity following digestion and fermentation. While anti-mutagenic
  activity has been reported for some phenolics  and fruit/vegetable extracts ,  none
  considered the effects of digestion or fermentation on bioactivity.


  Beyond activity related to the inhibition of the initiation of carcinogenesis, namely
  DNA damage and mutation, the berry phytochemicals also exhibited activity related
  to metastasis. In the present study, IVD berry extracts reduced invasiveness in
  a dose dependent manner similar to our previously reported data for an IVD raspberry
  extract . Again, the berry extracts retained their activity following fermentation
  and significantly inhibited invasion of HT115 cells. Migration of HT115 cells was
  unaffected by the addition of any of the berry extracts which suggests that the
  berry extracts may act upon surface adhesion or enzymatic degradation rather than
  on cell on motility. While a few studies have shown that fruit extracts including
  mulberry have decreased invasion in a range of cell lines including HT29 , HCT116
  , A549  and MDA-MB-231  they did not consider the role of digestion and fermentation
  on the bioactivity of the extracts. Similar consideration should also be given to
  activity related to cell proliferation as various berry extracts exhibit anti-proliferative
  activity in a range of colonocyte cell lines . While it is currently beyond the
  scope of this paper, it would no doubt be of interest to investigate the impact
  of digestion and fermentation on such effects.


  In conclusion, it would appear that berry extracts retain their biological activity
  after digestion and fermentation despite considerable structural modification and
  this strongly suggests that breakdown products and individual colonic metabolites,
  including, tyrosol and 4′–hydroxyphenylacetic acid, can modulate cellular processes
  associated with colon cancer. One can envisage that depending on their position
  in the colon, epithelial cells are likely to be exposed to varying concentrations
  of a mixture of phenolic components that have survived digestion in the upper gastrointestinal
  tract and their fermentation products and this study suggests that both sets of
  phenolic components can beneficially influence events relevant to the development
  of colon cancer.
