  effect of resveratrol and melatonin on hormonal positive breast cancer cells co-cultured

text: '


  Targeting the estrogen pathway has been proven effective in the treatment for estrogen
  receptor positive breast cancer. There are currently two common groups of anti-estrogenic
  compounds used in the clinic; Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators  and Selective
  Estrogen Enzyme Modulators. Among various naturally occurring, biologically active
  compounds, resveratrol and melatonin have been suggested to act as aromatase inhibitors,
  which make them potential candidates in hormonal treatment of breast cancer. Here
  we used a co-culture model in which we previously demonstrated that primary human
  breast adipose fibroblasts  can convert testosterone to estradiol, which subsequently
  results in estrogen receptor-mediated breast cancer T47D cell proliferation. In
  the presence of testosterone in this model, we examined the effect of letrozole,
  resveratrol and melatonin on cell proliferation, estradiol  production and gene
  expression of CYP19A1, pS2 and Ki-67. Both melatonin and resveratrol were found
  to be aromatase inhibitors in this co-culture system, albeit at different concentrations.
  Our co-culture model did not provide any indications that melatonin is also a selective
  estrogen receptor modulator. In the T47D-BAF co-culture, a melatonin concentration
  of 20 nM and resveratrol concentration of 20 M have an aromatase inhibitory effect
  as potent as 20 nM letrozole, which is a clinically used anti-aromatase drug in
  breast cancer treatment. The SEEM mechanism of action of especially melatonin clearly
  offers potential advantages for breast cancer treatment.'
