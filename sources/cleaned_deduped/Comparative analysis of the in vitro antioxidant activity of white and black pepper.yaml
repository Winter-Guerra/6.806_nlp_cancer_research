  As a result of normal metabolic processes, the human body produces reactive oxygen
  species capable of oxidizing biomolecules that can damage DNA, cells, and contribute
  to chronic disease. This process can be attenuated or perhaps reversed by diets
  containing spices that have the ability to scavenge reactive oxygen species. The
  present study measured the concentration of polyphenols in peppercorn using the
  Folin-Ciocalteu method and investigated the radical scavenging activities of hydrolyzed
  and nonhydrolyzed pepper extracts using 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl, the superoxide
  radical, and the hydroxyl radical as substrates. The hydrolyzed and nonhydrolyzed
  extracts of black pepper contained significantly more polyphenols compared with
  those of white pepper. For either of these peppercorns, the hydrolyzed extract contained
  significantly more polyphenols compared with the nonhydrolyzed extract. A dose-dependent
  effect was observed in the free radical and reactive oxygen species scavenging activities
  of all the extracts, with the black pepper extracts being the most effective. Peppercorns
  especially black pepper, which constitutes an important component in the diet of
  many sub-Saharan and oriental countries, can therefore be promoted for their nutritional
  importance as antioxidants and radical scavengers.'
