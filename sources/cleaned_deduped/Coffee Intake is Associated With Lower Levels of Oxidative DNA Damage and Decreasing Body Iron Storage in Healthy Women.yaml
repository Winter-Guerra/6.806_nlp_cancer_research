  Habitual coffee drinking has been linked to a lower risk for some forms of cancer,
  but the mechanism remains elusive. Coffee may decrease oxidative DNA damage, an
  important pathway to carcinogenesis. We examined the association between coffee
  consumption and urinary 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine concentrations, a biomarker of systemic
  oxidative DNA damage and repair, in 507 healthy subjects while adjusting for age,
  sex, smoking status, body mass index, job type, and fasting blood glucose in multivariable
  regression models. The association with green tea consumption was also assessed.
  Urinary 8-OHdG concentrations tended to decrease with coffee consumption in women,
  with women drinking 2â€“3 cups of coffee per day showing the lowest mean of urinary
  8-OHdG concentrations. This association was largely attenuated after further adjustment
  for serum ferritin concentrations, a marker of body iron storage. Green tea consumption
  was not associated with urinary 8-OHdG concentrations. Coffee drinking may be associated
  with decreased systemic oxidative DNA damage through decreasing body iron storage
  in women.'
