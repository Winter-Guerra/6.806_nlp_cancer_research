  regarding the role of dietary fat in breast cancer etiology. We investigated the
  association of dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids and the ratio of n-6 PUFAs to
  marine-derived n-3 PUFAs with breast cancer risk in the Shanghai Womens Health Study,
  a prospective cohort study including 72,571 cancer-free participants at baseline.
  Dietary fatty acid intake was determined using food frequency questionnaires. We
  used Cox proportional hazards analysis to estimate the relative risks and 95% confidence
  intervals for the association of breast cancer risk with dietary fatty acids consumption.
  In 583,998 person-years of follow-up, we identified 712 breast cancer cases. We
  found no association of breast cancer risk to dietary intake of linoleic acid, arachidonic
  acid, α-linolenic acid or marine-derived n-3 PUFA. We found a statistically significant
  interaction between n-6 PUFA intake, marine-derived n-3 PUFA intake and breast cancer
  risk. Women with lower intake of marine-derived n-3 PUFA and higher intake of n-6
  PUFA had an increase risk for breast cancer compared to women with higher intake
  of marine-derived n-3 PUFAs and lower intake of n-6 PUFAs after adjusting for potential
  confounders. The relative amounts of n-6 PUFA to marine-derived n-3 PUFAs may be
  more important for breast cancer risk than individual dietary amounts of these fatty
  acids.\n\nThe role of dietary fat in the etiology of breast cancer remains controversial.1-3
  Part of the uncertainty is due to the complex composition of dietary fat. Dietary
  fat represents a heterogenous group of lipids and fatty acids that can vary by carbon
  chain length, number of double bonds, position of double bonds and spatial configuration.
  If individual fatty acids have conflicting effects on breast cancer risk, then analytic
  approaches incorporating composite dietary fat measurements might be misleading.
  This concern is plausible, as animal models have demonstrated that long-chain polyunsaturated
  fatty acids have differential effects on mammary tumorigenesis based on double-bond
  position.4-7\n\nMeta-analyses of mouse mammary tumor models have suggested that
  n-6 PUFAs such as linoleic acid and arachidonic acid have a tumor-promoting effect.4,
  6 A potential mechanisms behind the cancer-promoting effects of n-6 PUFAs are through
  the production of proinflammatory eicosanoids such as prostaglandin E2, which promotes
  angiogenesis and hinders apoptosis. Alternatively, marine-derived n-3 PUFAs such
  as eicosapentanoic acid and docosahexanoic acid are the precursor molecules to eicosanoids
  that are less inflammatory when compared to ARA-derived prostanoids.8, 9 As such
  the substitution of n-3 PUFA for n-6 PUFAs within the diet could have a chemopreventive
  effect.10 Animal models have not consistently demonstrated that n-3 PUFAs reduce
  the risk of mammary carcinogenesis5, 7; however, background diet, specifically intake
  of n-6 PUFA may mitigate the protective effect on n-3 PUFAs.11\n\nWe used data collected
  as part of the Shanghai Womens Health Study, a prospective cohort study, to investigate
  the association of breast cancer risk to dietary PUFA intake. We also evaluated
  the impact of marine-derived n-3 PUFAs on breast cancer risk in individuals reporting
  different dietary intakes of n-6 PUFAs.\n\n\nALA: α-linolenic acid; ARA: arachidonic
  acid; DHA: docosahexanoic acid; DPA: docosapentanoic acid; EPA: eicosapentanoic
  acid; LA: linoleic acid; PUFA: polyunsaturated fatty acid\n\n\n\nThe SWHS is a population-based
  prospective cohort study that enrolled 74,942 women aged 40-70 years from seven
  urban communities in Shanghai from 1996 to 2000. A detailed study rationale and
  design has been published previously.12 Briefly, study participants completed a
  baseline survey including information on dietary habits, reproductive history, hormone
  use, physical activity, personal medical history, smoking and alcohol history, occupational
  history and family cancer history. The overall study participation rate was 92.7%.
  In our study, we excluded participants with a prior history of cancer at baseline
  or with a missing date of cancer diagnosis. In addition, we excluded subjects with
  missing values for body mass index on the baseline survey and subjects reporting
  implausible total energy intakes.\n\nThe cohort has been followed with a combination
  of biennial in-home interviews and annual record linkage with the Shanghai Cancer
  Registry and Shanghai Vital Statistics database. The in-home interviews collect
  interim health history details. The follow-up rates for the first, second and the
  third follow-up surveys were 99.8, 98.7 and 96.7%, respectively. Follow-up rates
  have been optimized as almost the entire cohort has continued to live in Shanghai
  with 80% remaining in the same neighborhood over the course of the study.12 All
  breast cancer cases identified through cancer registry matches are verified by medical
  charts from the diagnostic hospital. For our study, we included all incident breast
  cancer cases diagnosed from baseline enrollment to December 2007.\n\nAt baseline,
  participants completed a comprehensive dietary assessment questionnaire. A second
  dietary assessment was completed during the first dietary follow-up survey from
  2000 to 2004. Data were obtained regarding usual dietary intake over the past 12
  months. Individual nutrient intakes for specific fatty acids and other nutrients
  were calculated by the product of the amount of each food consumed by the nutrient
  content of the specific food based on the Chinese Food Composition Table.13 This
  food frequency questionnaire has been validated through comparisons of dietary intake
  derived from the FFQ to 24-hr dietary recalls in a dietary calibration study among
  200 SWHS participants.14 Although our study did not investigate specific PUFAs,
  it did determine Pearsons correlation coefficients for intakes of fish and red meat.
  For fish and red meat, the agreement of FFQ surveys and the average of multiple
  24-hr dietary recalls was moderate to good.\n\nTo reduce error in assessing usual
  dietary intake, we calculate the mean reported dietary intake for specific nutrients
  based on the baseline and first follow-up dietary questionnaires. This mean value
  was used for all subsequent analyses. For participants who were diagnosed with any
  cancer type or diabetes mellitus during the period between the baseline FFQ and
  the second follow-up FFQ, only the baseline-reported fatty acid intake was used
  for the data analysis given the concern that some women may have changed their dietary
  habits after the diagnosis of these diseases. We calculated dietary n-6 PUFA intake
  by combining LA and ARA. Dietary n-3 PUFA intake was calculated by combining α-linolenic
  acid, EPA and DHA. Dietary marine-derived n-3 PUFA intake was calculated by combining
  EPA and DHA.\n\nBaseline characteristics between breast cancer cases and noncases
  were compared using the chi-squared statistics for categorical variables and Students
  t-test for continuous variables. The levels of correlation between continuous baseline
  characteristics and dietary n-6 PUFA and marine-derived n-3 PUFA intake was determined
  using Spearman rank correlation as these variables were not normally distributed.
  We compared dietary median intake of n-6 and marine-derived n-3 PUFA by categorical
  baseline variables using Wilcoxon rank-order sum test.\n\nCox proportional hazards
  analysis was used to estimate the relative risks and 95% confidence intervals for
  the association of breast cancer risk with dietary fatty acids consumption. Entry
  time into the model was age at enrollment and exit time was age at censoring due
  to death or loss to follow-up. Age was used as the time scale in all models. Dietary
  intake of fatty acids was adjusted for energy intake using the residual method.15
  Dietary PUFAs were categorized into quintiles based on the overall distribution
  of the energy-adjusted nutrient intakes of the cohort. A priori covariates included
  for adjustment were age at cohort entry, body mass index, family history of breast
  cancer, highest obtained educational level, smoking status, alcohol use, regular
  physical activity in past 5 years, use of hormone replacement therapy, personal
  diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, total red meat consumption, total fish consumption,
  total vitamin E intake, age at menopause, age at first pregnancy and parity. Fish
  intake was included within the models as these food sources represent the major
  contributors to marine-derived n-3 PUFAs but might contain other potential confounding
  factors such as methylmercury or dioxins.16, 17 To determine whether the inclusion
  of fish intake might result in overadjustment of our models because of its strong
  correlation to marine-derived n-3 PUFAs, we constructed models including fish intake
  as both a continuous variable and as a mean-centered variable. Our results were
  not appreciably changed, and all data presented include fish intake as a continuous
  variable. Because vitamin E intake may influence the effects of marine-derived fatty
  acids by modifying lipid peroxidation, we included this nutrient in all models as
  a potential confounder.18, 19 Menopausal status was included within the model as
  a time-dependant covariate. Models were stratified by birth cohort in 5-year intervals.
  Test for linear trend was conducted by including the median intake within each PUFA
  quintile within the model.\n\nTo test for a possible interaction between n-6 PUFA
  and marine-derived n-3 PUFA, we stratified energy-adjusted intake of both fatty
  acid types into tertiles. We used the likelihood ratio test to evaluate potential
  multiplicative interactions of the two variables by comparing the models with and
  without the cross product term of these variables. All statistical analyses were
  conducted using SAS version 9.1. All p values were two sided, and significant level
  was set at 0.05.\n\n\n\nWomen who developed breast cancer were more likely to have
  a family history of breast cancer, have a higher educational level, a younger age
  at menarche, an older age at menopause, be nulliparous and older at first pregnancy
  compared to noncases. There were no differences between cases and noncases with
  regards to age, alcohol use, tobacco use, hormone replacement therapy use, body
  mass index, waist-to-hip ratio or consumption of red meat, fish or vitamin E.  \n\n\nConsumption
  of n-6 PUFA was moderately correlated to red meat intake and fish intake. Intake
  of marine-derived n-3 PUFA was strongly correlated with fish intake and weakly correlated
  red meat intake.  \n\n\nIn multivariate models, we found no association between
  intake of dietary LA, ARA, ALA and marine-derived n-3 PUFA and breast cancer risk.
  We found no association between ratios of n-6 to n-3 PUFA or n-6 to marine-derived
  n-3 PUFAs and breast cancer risk. There was a nonsignificant trend for an increased
  risk of breast cancer with increasing ratio of n-6 PUFA to marine-derived n-3 PUFA.
  \ \n\n\nWe evaluated the joint effect of n-6 PUFA consumption and marine-derived
  n-3 PUFA consumption on breast cancer risk. In general, the risk of breast cancer
  was increased with decreasing intake of n-3 PUFA and increasing intake of n-6 PUFA.
  Women who had the highest intake of n-6 PUFAs and the lowest intake of marine-derived
  n-3 PUFAs were at the highest risk of breast cancer compared to women in the lowest
  tertile of n-6 PUFA and highest tertile of marine-derived n-3 PUFA intake. For women
  with the highest intake of marine-derived n-3 PUFA, women in the highest tertile
  of n-6 PUFA had an increased risk of breast cancer compared to women in the lowest
  tertile of n-6 PUFA intake. There was a statistically significant interaction between
  total n-6 PUFA intake, marine-derived n-3 PUFA intake and breast cancer risk.  \n\n\n\n\nIn
  this large prospective study, we found no significant main effects for an association
  between dietary PUFAs intake and breast cancer risk; however, we did find a significant
  interaction between n-6 and marine-derived n-3 PUFAs. Women who reported consuming
  high levels of n-6 PUFAs concomitantly with low levels of marine-derived n-3 PUFAs
  were at a twofold increased risk for breast cancer compared to women consuming high
  levels of marine-derived n-3 PUFA and lower levels of n-6 PUFA.\n\nWe found no main
  effects for any individual n-6 PUFA or marine-derived n-3 PUFA, which is consistent
  with most prior prospective studies.20-27 Nevertheless, some prospective cohort
  studies have described both increased28 and decreased29 risks of breast cancer associated
  with n-6 PUFA intake. Three prospective studies have found a reduced risk of breast
  cancer associated with dietary n-3 PUFA intake, which appears predominately in postmenopausal
  women.30-32 We found no significant differences in individual PUFAs effect estimates
  between pre- and postmenopausal women.\n\nBecause of the competition between n-6
  PUFA and n-3 PUFAs as enzyme substrates and within membrane phospholipids, it has
  been suggested that an analytic approach focusing on a single fatty acid at a time
  may be insufficient.33 Several studies have tried to address these limitations by
  investigated the ratio of n-6 PUFAs to n-3 PUFA. The findings have been mixed with
  some studies finding an increased ratio of n-6 PUFA to n-3 PUFA to be associated
  with an increased breast cancer risk,23, 30, 33-37 while other studies being largely
  null.26, 28, 31, 38, 39 Similar to Thiebaut et al., we found a significant interaction
  between n-6 and n-3 PUFAs.23\n\nPart of the reasons for the discrepant finding between
  studies with regard to the ratio of n-6 PUFAs to n-3 PUFAs likely results from the
  choice of fatty acids to include within this summary measure. In prior studies,
  total n-3 PUFAs has been calculated as:,25, 37,23, 3336 and.30 We did not include
  ALA within our summary measure as it is poorly converted to EPA in humans,40, 41
  and antineoplastic effects have mainly been described with marine-derived fatty
  acids.7 We did not include docosapentanoic acid within our summary n-3 PUFA measure
  as it can be derived from either ARA or EPA.42 In addition, most dietary DPA is
  in the n-6 PUFA form and found in red meat as opposed to the n-3 PUFA form that
  is found predominately in seal oil.43, 44\n\nOur study has several strengths. The
  study is a prospective cohort that has eliminated potential for recall biases. In
  addition, follow-up for the SWHS has been excellent. Our study has a large sample
  size with almost 600,000 person-years of follow-up and has the power to detect even
  a weak association. The most important limitation of our study is related to the
  calculation of marine fatty acid dietary content. We have not examined the correlation
  between fatty acid biomarkers of n-3 PUFAs and FFQ in this population; however,
  in other studies, these correlations have ranged from 0.20 to 31.45, 46 These poor
  correlations are partially the result of the lack of specificity regarding fish
  species consumed and other factors which might impact n-3 PUFA content of fish.
  Nondifferential misclassification errors could have attenuated our results. To try
  to reduce dietary fatty acid intake reporting errors, we averaged the dietary reports
  over two questionnaires.\n\nIn conclusion, we found a trend toward increased breast
  cancer risk with increasing dietary ratio of total n-6 PUFA to marine-derived n-3
  PUFAs. The relative amounts of n-6 PUFA to marine-derived n-3 PUFAs may influence
  breast cancer risk, with low intake of marine-derived n-3 PUFAs associated with
  an increased risk for breast cancer in the setting of high n-6 PUFA intake.\n\n\n\n"
