  cell migration and invasion. Herein, we investigated the effects of silibinin on
  12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-induced cell migration and MMP-9 expression
  in thyroid and breast cancer cells. Our results revealed that the levels of MMP-9
  mRNA and protein expression were significantly increased by TPA but not MMP-2 in
  TPC-1 and MCF7 cells. To verify the regulatory mechanism of TPA-induced MMP-9 expression,
  we treated TPC-1 and MCF7 cells with the MEK1/2 inhibitor, UO126, and TPA-induced
  MMP-9 expression was significantly decreased. We also found that TPA-induced cell
  migration and MMP-9 expression was significantly decreased by silibinin. In addition,
  TPA-induced phosphorylation of MEK and ERK was also inhibited by silibinin. Taken
  together, we suggest that silibinin suppresses TPA-induced cell migration and MMP-9
  expression through the MEK/ERK-dependent pathway in thyroid and breast cancer cells.\n\n\n\nSilibinin
  is the main component of the silymarin complex and is isolated from the seeds of
  Silybum marianum, also known as milk thistle. Silibinin has a wide range of pharmacologic
  effects including the induction of apoptosis, and the inhibition of cell proliferation,
  cell invasion and angiogenesis. Recently, Kim et al reported that silibinin triggers
  cell cycle arrest through the downregulation of cyclin B1 and cdc2 and upregulation
  of p21 expression in triple-negative breast cancer cells. In addition, silibinin
  was found to effectively delay the development of spontaneous mammary tumors and
  decrease the tumor mass in Her2/neu transgenic mice.\n\nMigration of cells is a
  dynamic process that occurs in tissue remodeling, inflammation and wound repair
  and is regulated by a variety of extracellular factors, including extracellular
  matrix proteins. Tumor cell migration is associated with the early stages of metastasis.
  Metastasis is considered responsible for more than 90% of cancer-related deaths.
  During metastasis, cancer cells are involved in numerous interactions with various
  factors such as the ECM, growth factors, cytokines and basement membranes. Consequently,
  cancer cells acquire motility and local invasive capability. In addition, cancer
  cell-mediated tissue remodeling is observed to have a strong positive correlation
  with matrix metalloproteinase levels.\n\nMMPs are major critical molecules that
  assist tumor cells during metastasis. They play an important role in ECM degradation
  and cancer cell invasion. Overexpression of MMPs contributes to tumorigenesis and
  tumor progression through multiple pathways. MMP-9 is one of two gelatinases and
  is able to degrade type IV collagen, which is abundant in basement membranes. High
  serum levels of MMP-9 are associated with a higher tumor grade, poor overall survival
  and secondary metastasis in melanoma and breast cancer tissue.\n\nIn the present
  study, we investigated the relationship between silibinin and cell migration in
  thyroid and breast cancer cells. Here, our results revealed that 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-induced
  MMP-9 expression and cell migration were suppressed by silibinin in both thyroid
  and breast cancer cells.\n\n\n\n\n\nDulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium, antibiotics
  and 10% zymogram gel were purchased from Life Technologies. Fetal bovine serum was
  purchased from Hyclone. Silibinin was purchased from Sigma. Mouse recombinant MMP-9
  was purchased from R&amp;D Systems. TPA was purchased from Tocris. The secondary
  peroxidase-conjugated antibodies and ECL Prime reagents were purchased from Amersham.\n\nPapillary
  thyroid cancer TPC-1 and breast cancer MCF7 cells were grown in a humidified atmosphere
  of 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37°C in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM glutamine,
  100 IU/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Each cell line was maintained in
  culture medium supplemented without FBS for 24 h.\n\n\n\nCells were maintained in
  culture medium without FBS for 24 h, and then the culture medium was replaced with
  fresh medium without FBS, and the cells were further incubated with the indicated
  concentrations of silibinin for 24 h. In the experiments involving silibinin, the
  cells were pretreated with 50 μM silibinin for 60 min prior to treatment with 20
  nM TPA for 24 h.\n\n\n\nZymography was performed on 10% polyacrylamide gels that
  had been cast in the presence of gelatin as previously described. Briefly, samples
  were resuspended in a loading buffer and run on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel containing 0.5
  mg/ml gelatin without prior denaturation. After electrophoresis, the gels were washed
  to remove SDS and incubated for 30 min at room temperature in a renaturing buffer.
  Next, the gels were incubated for 48 h at 37°C in a developing buffer . The gels
  were subsequently stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250, destained in 30%
  methanol, and flooded with 10% acetic acid to detect gelatinase secretion.\n\n\n\nTotal
  RNA was extracted from cells using the TRIzol reagent, according to the manufacturer’s
  protocol. Isolated RNA samples were then used for RT-PCR. Samples were reverse-transcribed
  into cDNA in 20-μl reaction volumes using a first-strand cDNA synthesis kit for
  RT-PCR, according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\n\nGene expression was quantified
  by real-time PCR using the SensiMix SYBR kit and 100 ng of cDNA per reaction. The
  sequences of the primer sets used for this analysis were: human MMP-9, MMP-2, and
  β-actin as an internal control. An annealing temperature of 60°C was used for all
  of the primers. PCRs were performed in a standard 384-well plate format with an
  ABI 7900HT real-time PCR detection system. For data analysis, the raw threshold
  cycle value was first normalized to the housekeeping gene for each sample to obtain
  ΔCT. The normalized ΔCT was then calibrated to control cell samples to obtain ΔΔCT.\n\n\n\nTotal
  cell numbers following treatment with silibinin were evaluated by Quick Cell Proliferation
  Assay Kit II according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, TPC-1 human papillary
  thyroid cancer cells were grown in a 96-well plate in 100 μl/well of culture media
  in the absence or presence of the indicated concentrations of silibinin. After incubating
  the cells for 24 h, 10 μl WST reagent was added to each well. Viable cells were
  quantified photometrically at 480 nm.\n\n\n\nTPC-1 thyroid cancer cells were seeded
  in 6-well plates and were cultured for 24 h. A monolayer of cells was scratched
  with a 200-μl pipette tip to create a wound, and then this was washed twice in PBS
  to remove any suspended cells. The cells were pretreated with silibinin for 60 min
  prior to treatment with TPA; the monolayer of cells was then treated with 20 nM
  TPA for 24 h in serum-free media. The cells migrating from the leading edge were
  photographed at 0 and 24 h using a CK40 inverted microscope.\n\n\n\nStatistical
  significance was determined using the Student’s t-test. The results are presented
  as the means ± SEM. All p-values were two-tailed and significance was set at a p-value
  ;0.05.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe levels of MMP-9 and MMP-2 mRNA and protein expression in the
  TPC-1 and MCF7 cells were determined following treatment with TPA at the indicated
  concentrations for 24 h. We analyzed the levels of MMP-9 and MMP-2 mRNA and protein
  expression using real-time PCR and zymography, respectively. Our results revealed
  that the levels of MMP-9 protein expression were significantly increased in the
  TPC-1 thyroid and MCF7 breast cancer cells. However, MMP-2 protein expression was
  not altered following TPA treatment in the TPC-1 cells, although MMP-2 expression
  was not detected in the MCF7 cells following TPA treatment. In addition, the levels
  of MMP-9 mRNA were also increased following TPA treatment. MMP-9 mRNA expression
  was increased by 28.8±6.6- and 30.6±2.5-fold in the TPC-1 thyroid and MCF7 breast
  cancer cells, respectively, following treatment with 20 nM TPA when compared with
  the control level.  \n\n\n\n\nTo verify the regulatory mechanism of TPA-induced
  MMP-9 expression, we examined the effect of the MEK1/2 inhibitor, UO126, on TPA-induced
  MMP-9 expression. After pretreatment of TPC-1 and MCF7 cells with 10 μM UO126 for
  30 min, we treated the cells with 20 nM TPA for 24 h. The levels of TPA-induced
  MMP-9 protein expression were significantly decreased by UO126 in the TPC-1 thyroid
  and MCF7 breast cancer cells. In addition, TPA-induced MMP-9 mRNA expression was
  also decreased following pretreatment with UO126. MMP-9 mRNA expression was increased
  by 29.4±2.4- and 41.8±0.6-fold, respectively, in the TPC-1 thyroid and MCF7 breast
  cancer cells, following treatment with 20 nM TPA when compared with control levels.
  In contrast, TPA-induced MMP-9 expression was significantly decreased by 7.5±1.9
  and 4.5±1.3-fold in the TPC-1 thyroid and MCF7 breast cancer cells, respectively,
  following treatment with 10 μM UO126 when compared with the control levels.  \n\n\nNext,
  we confirmed the effect of UO126 on TPA-induced phosphorylation of MEK and ERK in
  TPC-1 thyroid cancer cells. As expected, the phosphorylation of MEK and ERK was
  increased following TPA treatment. In contrast, TPA-induced phosphorylation of MEK
  and ERK was significantly decreased by UO126.\n\n\n\nThe chemical structure of silibinin
  is represented in Fig. 3A. Our results revealed that the cell viability was significantly
  decreased following treatment with 100 μM silibinin. Therefore, we treated cells
  with 50 μM silibinin in the subsequent studies.  \n\n\nTo investigate the effect
  of silibinin on TPA-induced MMP-9 expression, we pretreated cells with 50 μM silibinin
  for 60 min prior to treatment with 20 nM TPA. We found that TPA-induced MMP-9 protein
  expression was significantly decreased by silibinin treatment. In addition, the
  levels of expression of MMP-9 mRNA increased significantly in the TPC-1 thyroid
  and MCF7 breast cancer cells, respectively, following treatment with a concentration
  of 20 nM TPA when compared to control levels. In contrast, TPA-induced MMP-9 mRNA
  expression was decreased to 5.7±0.6-fold in TPC-1 thyroid cancer cells by 50 μM
  silibinin. MCF7 breast cancer cells also showed similar results following treatment
  with 50 μM silibinin when compared with the control level.  \n\n\n\n\nIn the next
  experiment, we examined the effect of silibinin on TPA-induced cell migration in
  TPC-1 thyroid cancer cells. As shown in Fig. 5A, TPA-induced cell migration was
  completely blocked by 50 μM silibinin treatment.  \n\n\nNext, we investigated the
  effect of silibinin on TPA-induced phosphorylation of MEK and ERK in TPC-1 thyroid
  cancer cells. As expected, the phosphorylation of MEK and ERK was increased following
  TPA treatment. In contrast, TPA-induced phosphorylation of MEK and ERK was decreased
  by silibinin. Therefore, we demonstrated that silibinin suppressed TPA-induced cell
  migration as well as inhibited MMP-9 expression.\n\n\n\nPhorbol esters, such as
  TPA, are natural molecules that are recognized as potent tumor promoters and can
  potently trigger multiple cellular events such as protein kinase C. TPA was found
  to significantly enhance cell migration abilities of human cancer cells including
  hepatoma and breast cancer cells. In addition, TPA-induced migration and invasion
  of glioblastoma cells were prevented by blocking PKCα-dependent pathways. Consistent
  with these reports, we found that TPA increased cell migration in thyroid and breast
  cancer cells. Herein, we investigated the inhibitory effect of silibinin on TPA-induced
  cancer cell migration.\n\nMMPs are positively associated with tumor progression
  including tumor differentiation, metastasis and poor prognosis. In addition, inhibition
  of MMPs decreases cell invasion while the activation of MMPs yields increased tumor
  cell invasion. MMP-9 is one of the gelatinases and is expressed in a large number
  of cell types, including epithelial and inflammatory cells. MMP-9 has been associated
  with the development and extent of metastases in lymph nodes. Although we did not
  present the data, TPA-induced cell migration was significantly suppressed by a broad-spectrum
  MMP inhibitor, PD166793, in both TPC-1 and MCF7 cells. Therefore, we demonstrated
  that a broad-spectrum MMP inhibitor, PD166793, directly or indirectly affects TPA-induced
  cell migration through the regulation of MMP activity.\n\nThe region of the MMP-9
  promoter contains cis-acting regulatory elements for transcription factors, including
  two AP-1 sites and an NF-κB site. The DNA binding activity of a variety of transcription
  factors such as NF-kB and AP-1 is regulated by ERK activity. Recently, we reported
  that TPA-induced transcriptional activity of AP-1 is mediated through the Raf/MEK/ERK-dependent
  pathway. In addition, the transcriptional expression of MMP-9 was found to be directly
  regulated by AP-1 DNA binding activity and was completely suppressed by the MEK1/2
  inhibitor, UO126. In accordance with these studies, TPA-induced MMP-9 expression
  was significantly decreased by silibinin. TPA-induced phosphorylation of MEK and
  ERK was also suppressed.\n\nConclusively, we found that silibinin suppresses the
  TPA-induced phosphorylation of MEK and ERK in thyroid cancer cells. In addition,
  cell migration and MMP-9 expression were completely inhibited by silibinin. Therefore,
  silibinin may be a promising drug for the treatment of thyroid and breast cancer.\n\n\n\nThis
  study was supported by a Korea Research Foundation Grant funded by the Korean government.\n"
