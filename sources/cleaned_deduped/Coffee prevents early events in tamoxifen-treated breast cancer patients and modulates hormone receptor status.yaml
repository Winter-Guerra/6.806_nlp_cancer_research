  prevents early events in tamoxifen-treated breast cancer patients and modulates
  hormone receptor status.md
text: "\n\nWhether coffee modulates response to endocrine therapy in breast cancer
  patients is currently unknown. The CYP1A2 and CYP2C8 enzymes contribute to tamoxifen
  and caffeine metabolism. The purpose was to investigate the impact of coffee consumption
  on tumor characteristics and risk for early events in relation to breast cancer
  treatment and CYP1A2 and CYP2C8 genotypes.\n\nQuestionnaires regarding lifestyle
  were completed preoperatively by 634 patients in southern Sweden. CYP1A21F and CYP2C83
  were genotyped. Clinical data and tumor characteristics were obtained from patients
  charts, population registries, and pathology reports. Coffee consumption was categorized
  as low, moderate, or high.\n\nThe proportion of estrogen receptor negative  tumors
  increased with increasing coffee consumption. Moderate to high consumption was associated
  with lower frequency of discordant receptor status  OR 0.38  compared to low consumption.
  Median follow-up time was 4.92  years. Tamoxifen-treated patients with ER+ tumors
  \ who consumed two or more cups/day had significantly decreased risk for early events
  compared to patients with low consumption, adjusted HR 0.40. Low consumption combined
  with at least one CYP1A21F C-allele  or CYP2C83  was associated with a high risk
  for early events in tamoxifen-treated patients compared to other tamoxifen-treated
  patients, adjusted HRs 3.49  and 6.15, respectively.\n\nModerate to high coffee
  consumption was associated with significantly decreased risk for early events in
  tamoxifen-treated patients and modified hormone receptor status. If confirmed, new
  recommendations regarding coffee consumption during tamoxifen treatment may be warranted.\n\nIn
  2010, 7,917 women were diagnosed with breast cancer in Sweden, making breast cancer
  the most common cancer to affect women in Sweden. Here, the reported frequency of
  breast cancers expressing estrogen receptors  ranges from 66.0 to 86.1 %. Patients
  with ER + tumors are usually treated with endocrine therapy to reduce the proliferation
  of tumor cells. However, 4050 % of the tumors expressing estrogen and progesterone
  receptors  are insensitive to endocrine therapy. Treatment effect may be influenced
  by host and tumor genetic factors, and medications, as well as environmental factors,
  including lifestyle factors such as coffee consumption. A recent study reported
  that coffee reduced the risk for aggressive ER tumors in a Swedish cohort. However,
  whether coffee consumption is associated with modulated ER/PgR status and the response
  to endocrine therapy is currently unknown. More knowledge about the interaction
  between lifestyle factors and different breast cancer treatment is needed.\n\nAccording
  to the European Coffee Report 2009, Swedes are the third largest coffee consumers
  in Europe, with an average individual consumption of 3.4 cups/day. Less than 1 %
  of the coffee consumed in Sweden is decaffeinated. Coffee contains several bioactive
  ingredients such as the phenolics caffeic acid and chlorogenic acid, caffeine, and
  phytoestrogens. The different ingredients in coffee have both carcinogenic and anti-carcinogenic
  effects, which may influence the prognosis of breast cancer. For example, caffeine
  has been shown to inhibit mitosis and induce cell differentiation. Daily coffee
  consumption in 173,141 women who were 5071 year old at baseline was strongly associated
  with lower total mortality, but not for death due to any type of cancer. However,
  breast cancer-specific mortality was not investigated.\n\nIn premenopausal women,
  selective estrogen receptor modifiers such as tamoxifen are mainly used as endocrine
  treatment. Tamoxifen deactivates the ER and inhibits the proliferation of tumor
  cells. CYP2D6 is the key enzyme metabolizing the pro-drug tamoxifen into its metabolites
  4-hydroxy tamoxifen, 4-desmethyl tamoxifen, and its most active metabolite, endoxifen.
  The CYP1A2 and CYP2C8 enzymes also contribute to tamoxifen metabolism  as well as
  the metabolism of caffeine, while SULT1A1 has been proposed to be involved in sulfation
  of 4-hydroxytamoxifen and may also play a role in endoxifen clearance. In a subset
  of the present study cohort, it has previously been shown that moderate to high
  coffee intake modulates ER status in women with the CYP1A21F A/A genotype, but not
  in those with the CYP1A21F C-allele. The CYP1A2 enzyme is more inducible by coffee
  in CYP1A21F A/A carriers. It is therefore plausible that tamoxifen response is influenced
  by the CYP1A21F genotype and coffee intake and that any effect of coffee may be
  dependent on the CYP1A21F genotype. Similarly, CYP2C83 genotypes have previously
  been shown to be associated with an increased risk for early events in a subset
  of tamoxifen-treated patients from the present cohort. Tamoxifen response may therefore
  also be influenced by CYP2C8 genotype and coffee intake.\n\nThe aims of this study
  were to investigate the impact of coffee consumption on tumor and patient characteristics
  and risk for early events in relation to breast cancer treatment and different genotypes
  of CYP1A2 and CYP2C8.\n\nAs of October 2002, women diagnosed with a first breast
  cancer at the Lund University Hospital in Sweden were invited preoperatively to
  participate in an ongoing cohort. The overall aims are to study factors that may
  be of prognostic or predictive value. Patients with a prior history of breast cancer
  or another cancer diagnosis within the last 10 years were not invited to participate.
  There was no question on ethnicity, but the vast majority was ethnic Swedes. This
  paper is based on data collected from 634 patients between October 2002 and October
  2008. The patients were asked to fill out questionnaires preoperatively, on clinical
  follow-up visits after 36 months, 1, 2, and 3 years, and then at home at 5, 7, and
  9 years postoperatively. The follow-up rates of the patients without preoperative
  treatment included in the study and who were alive and breast cancer-free were as
  follows for the 9, 7, 5, and 3 year: 80.0, 86.3, 92.6, and 93.5 %, respectively.
  Patients who had received preoperative treatment  were excluded from analyses regarding
  tumor characteristics and risk for early events. A flowchart of patients included
  in the different analyses is presented in Fig. 1. Written informed consents were
  obtained from all patients. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the
  Lund University.\n\nDuring the preoperative visit, body weight, height, waist and
  hip circumferences, and breast volumes were measured. The measurement of the breast
  volume has previously been described. Body mass index  was calculated as weight
  in kilograms divided with height in meters squared. Waist to hip ratio  was calculated
  as waist circumference divided with hip circumference. The questionnaires included
  questions regarding birth date, date of surgery, reproductive history, and use of
  exogenous hormones. Lifestyle factors included smoking, alcohol, and coffee consumption.
  Alcohol consumption was reported in terms of frequency and the number of drinks
  consumed during the past week. In regard to coffee intake, the questionnaire provided
  nine consumption levels ranging from 0 to 8+ cups of coffee a day. The definition
  of a cup was not specified.\n\nInformation regarding type of adjuvant treatment,
  sentinel node biopsy, axillary node dissection, and type of surgery was collected
  from each patients chart. Treatment was registered up to the last recurrence-free
  follow-up. Data on tumor size, histological type and grade, and involved axillary
  lymph nodes were obtained from each patients pathology report. ER and PgR statuses
  were determined by means of immunohistochemistry using the Dako LSAB kit system.
  Tumors with &gt;10 % positive nuclear staining were considered ER+ or PgR+. The
  tumors were analyzed at the Department of Pathology at Lund University Hospital.\n\nInformation
  concerning breast cancer events, including local or regional recurrence, new breast
  cancer, or distant metastases, was obtained from patient charts, pathology reports,
  and the Regional Tumor Registry. Date of death was obtained from the Population
  Registry.\n\nGenomic deoxyribonucleic acid  was extracted from the leukocyte portion
  of the whole blood using the Wizard Genomic DNA Purification Kit. The genotyping
  was performed at the Region Skne Competence Centre, Malm University Hospital, Malm,
  Sweden. The two CYP2C83 SNPs  were analyzed with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization
  time-of-flight mass spectrometry on a Sequenom MassARRAY platform, using iPLEX reagents
  according to the manufacturers protocol. The Sequenom MassARRAY software was used
  for multiplex SNP analysis design. The concordance was 100 % between the two CYP2C83
  SNPs. The CYP1A21F  SNP was genotyped using a Taqman SNP allelic discrimination
  assay in 384-well format on ABI PRISM 7,900 Sequence Detection System. Nineteen
  patients were not successfully genotyped for the CYP1A21F  SNP using TaqMan. For
  16 of these patients, rs762551 genotypes were available from DNA sequencing from
  the previous study. The concordance rate between the two methods was 99.8 %.\n\nThe
  statistical analyses were performed with IBM SPSS Statistics 19.0. The patients
  who considered themselves smokers or party smokers were grouped as current smokers.
  Patient characteristics such as age at diagnosis, BMI, and WHR were analyzed in
  relation to daily coffee intake at the preoperative visit. As there were few patients
  with 0 cups/day and 1 cup/day, these groups were combined. The consumption was categorized
  as low, moderate, or high. KruskalWallis tests were used since these variables were
  not normally distributed. The moderate and high coffee consumers were combined into
  a group called moderate to high and analyzed with MannWhitney U test. The chi-square
  analyses were used to investigate the relationship between the categorical variables
  coffee  and parous, ever use of oral contraceptives, ever use of hormone replacement
  therapy, current smoking, alcohol abstaining, pT, histological grade, axillary node
  involvement, and hormone receptor status  as well as.\n\nFor the analyses of risk
  for early events, patients were followed from inclusion to last follow-up, any breast
  cancer event or death from non-breast cancer-related causes prior to 1 January 2012,
  whichever came first. Patients with carcinoma in situ  and patients with metastases
  detected earlier than 3 months after study inclusion  were excluded from the survival
  analyses. After exclusion, 73 patients were diagnosed with some type of breast cancer
  event during the 9-year follow-up, out of whom 46 patients had distant metastases.\n\nKaplanMeier
  LogRank was used to compare risk for early events in relation to coffee consumption
  in different treatment groups. Patients were stratified according to whether or
  not they had been treated with chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or endocrine therapy
  prior to the first breast cancer event, last follow-up, or death. Treatment after
  any breast cancer event was not considered. Since few of the patients had invasive
  tumor sizes pT3 or pT4, these patients were combined with pT2 group in the survival
  analyses. Cox regression was used to analyze risk for early events in relation to
  coffee, adjusting for age above median age at diagnosis, invasive tumor size, axillary
  lymph node involvement, histological grade III, and ER status.\n\nIn the survival
  analyses, CYP genotypes and different levels of coffee consumption were first analyzed
  as independent variables. Secondly, two interaction variables were created to analyze
  whether there were any geneenvironment interaction between having at least one minor
  allele and a low coffee consumption on the risk for early events.\n\nA p value ;0.05
  was considered significant. All p values were two-tailed. Nominal p values were
  presented without adjustments for multiple testing.\n\nThe preoperative patient
  characteristics are presented in Table 1. Age ranged from 25 to 99 years. The median
  age at diagnosis among the 634 patients was 59.6 years. Patients with moderate coffee
  consumption were older than patients with low or high coffee consumption. Current
  smoking was significantly associated with increasing coffee consumption, and the
  proportion of alcohol abstainers decreased with increasing coffee intake.\n\nPatient
  characteristics of the 634 patients in relation to daily coffee consumption, cups
  per daya  \n\nbPatients with prior breast surgery were excluded. Breast volume was
  missing for 7 patients\n\nThe tumor characteristics in relation to coffee intake
  are listed in Table 2. Moderate to high consumption was associated with smaller
  tumors. The proportion of ER+ tumors decreased with increasing consumption, while
  the proportion of PgR+ tumors was higher in patients with moderate to high consumption
  compared to patients with low consumption. The proportion of tumors with discordant
  receptor status was less than half in patients with moderate to high consumption
  compared to patients with low consumption. Other tumor characteristics were not
  significantly associated with coffee consumption.\n\nTumor characteristics of the
  patients in relation to daily coffee consumption, cups per daya  \n\naInformation
  on coffee consumption was missing for two patients in the following groups: pT1
  and pT2, axillary lymph node 0 and 13, histological grades II and III, ER+ PgR+,
  ER+ and PgR+\n\nCoffee consumption at the preoperative visit correlated strongly
  with the consumption at the follow-up visits. Compared to the preoperative coffee
  consumption, the frequency of patients who still consumed 2+ cups/day ranged from
  88.8 to 92.0 % at the follow-up visits.\n\nAmong the 574 patients with invasive
  tumors who had not received any preoperative treatment, who had no early distant
  metastases, and for whom data on preoperative coffee consumption were available,
  the median follow-up time was 4.92  years. Coffee intake was not associated with
  median duration of either tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitor  use.\n\nOverall, moderate
  to high coffee consumption was non-significantly associated with lower risk for
  early events, adjusted HR 0.65, adjusted for invasive tumor size, axillary lymph
  node involvement, histological grade, age, and ER status. Moderate to high coffee
  consumption was also associated with a lower risk for early events in chemotherapy-treated
  patients, adjusted HR 0.36, and a non-significantly decreased risk for early events
  in radiation therapy-treated patients compared to patients with low coffee consumption,
  adjusted HR 0.57.\n\nAfter stratification according to ER status, moderate to high
  coffee consumption was non-significantly associated with a lower risk for early
  events compared to low coffee consumption in patients with ER tumors, adjusted HR
  0.39  and in patients with ER+ tumors, adjusted HR 0.73.\n\nAfter stratification
  according to type of endocrine treatment, moderate to high coffee consumption was
  non-significantly associated with an increased risk for early events among patients
  with ER+ tumors who did not receive tamoxifen, Fig. 2a. Coffee consumption was not
  associated with risk for early events, neither in patients with ER+ tumors who did
  not receive any endocrine treatment  nor in patients who had been treated with AIs
  with or without tamoxifen. In patients who had only received AIs, all nine events
  appeared in the 54 patients with moderate to high coffee intake, while no events
  appeared in the 10 patients with low coffee consumption. However, the association
  between early events and coffee intake was not significant.\n\na Coffee consumption
  was not significantly associated with risk for early events among patients who did
  not receive tamoxifen treatment. b Tamoxifen-treated patients with ER+ tumors and
  moderate to high coffee consumption had a significantly lower risk for early events,
  compared to patients with low coffee consumption, adjusted HR 0.40. As this is an
  ongoing cohort, there are fewer patients with longer follow-up times\n\nFor the
  310 patients with invasive ER+ tumors who had been treated with tamoxifen and for
  whom data on coffee consumption were available, moderate to high coffee consumption
  at the preoperative visit was significantly associated with a lower risk for early
  events, Fig. 2b. In the multivariate model including the tamoxifen-treated patients,
  moderate to high coffee consumption was significantly associated with less than
  half the risk for early events compared to patients with low consumption, adjusted
  HR 0.40. In this model, coffee consumption was the strongest factor for early events.
  Adjustments were also made for BMI, HRT, smoking, and alcohol abstinence. None of
  these variables materially changed the association between coffee consumption and
  early breast cancer events. Similarly, after stratification according to PgR status,
  the association remained significant in both groups. After excluding patients who
  had been treated with both AI and tamoxifen, the association also remained significant.\n\nModerate
  to high coffee consumption was also associated with a lower risk for early distant
  metastases compared to low coffee consumption in tamoxifen-treated patients with
  ER + tumors, adjusted HR 0.41.\n\nThe CYP1A21F genotype distribution in the 631
  patients where this information was available was as follows: A/A, A/C, and C/C.
  The CYP1A21F A/A genotype was not associated with risk for early events in the tamoxifen-treated
  patients with ER + tumors. The combined effect of the CYP1A21F genotype and coffee
  consumption on the risk for early events was assessed in the following four groups:
  CYP1A21F A/A with low coffee intake, CYP1A21F any C-allele with low coffee intake,
  CYP1A21F A/A with moderate to high coffee intake, and CYP1A21F any C-allele with
  moderate to high coffee intake. There was no significant difference in risk for
  early events between the following three groups: CYP1A21F A/A with low coffee consumption,
  CYP1A21F A/A with moderate to high coffee consumption, and CYP1A21F any C-allele
  with moderate to high coffee consumption. However, in the 35 patients with at least
  one CYP1A21F C-allele and low coffee consumption, a significantly higher risk for
  early events compared with the other tamoxifen-treated patients with ER + tumors
  was observed, Fig. 3, adjusted HR 3.49.\n\nIn the 35 patients with at least one
  CYP1A21F C-allele and low coffee consumption, a significantly higher risk for early
  events compared with the other tamoxifen-treated patients with ER+ tumors was observed,
  adjusted HR 3.49. As this is an ongoing cohort, there are fewer patients with longer
  follow-up times\n\nThe CYP2C83 genotype distribution in the 634 patients where this
  information was available was as follows: 1/1, 1/3, and 3/3. Increasing number of
  CYP2C83 alleles was associated with increased risk of early events in the 310 tamoxifen-treated
  patients with ER+ tumors, adjusted HR 2.24  per allele. Again, the combined effect
  of CYP2C8 genotypes and coffee consumption was assessed in four groups. There were
  no differences in the risk for early events between the following three groups:
  CYP2C81/1 and low coffee intake, CYP2C81/1 and moderate to high coffee intake, and
  patients with any CYP2C83 allele and moderate to high coffee intake. However, in
  the 13 patients with any CYP2C83 allele and low coffee consumption, the risk for
  an early event was significantly higher compared to the other tamoxifen-treated
  patients, Fig. 4, adjusted HR 6.15.\n\nIn the 13 patients with any CYP2C83 allele
  and low coffee consumption, the risk for an early event was significantly higher
  compared to the other tamoxifen-treated patients, adjusted HR 6.15. As this is an
  ongoing cohort, there are fewer patients with longer follow-up times\n\nThe main
  finding of this study was that coffee consumption was associated with a significantly
  decreased risk for early breast cancer events in tamoxifen-treated patients with
  ER+ tumors. However, the long-term effects of coffee consumption are unknown since
  patients with ER+ breast cancer tend to experience later events than patients with
  ER tumors. Moreover, coffee consumption was significantly associated with modulated
  hormone receptor status including a higher frequency of ER and a lower frequency
  of ER+PgR tumors. ER+PgR breast cancers respond less well to tamoxifen than ER+PgR+
  tumors. However, coffee consumption was associated with a lower frequency of early
  events in tamoxifen-treated patients with ER+PgR as well as ER+PgR+ tumors.\n\nCaffeine
  has been shown to inhibit Akt phosphorylation. Phosphorylated Akt  downregulates
  PgR levels and activity and, in addition, induces ER ligand-independent activity.
  These results are consistent with the lower frequency of tumors with discordant
  ER and PgR status we found among patients with a moderate to high coffee consumption.
  The reduced clinical response to tamoxifen among patients with lower coffee consumption
  may result from a higher level of pAkt and thus a higher level of ligand-independent
  ER activity. However, a recent study showed that MCF-7 cells that were treated with
  caffeine showed a fourfold increase in the PgR mRNA expression. Further mechanistic
  studies are needed to investigate how coffee influences hormone receptor expression
  and activity in breast cancer.\n\nA higher frequency of ER tumors was associated
  with increasing coffee consumption in the present study. In contrast, a recent Swedish
  casecontrol study by Li et al.  found that postmenopausal patients with a consumption
  of five or more cups/day had a lower frequency of ER tumors compared to patients
  with a lower coffee consumption. One reason for the difference between the results
  of the present study and the Li et al. study may be that the present study also
  included premenopausal and postmenopausal patients. ER tumors are more common among
  premenopausal women. However, the association between a moderate to high coffee
  consumption and a higher frequency of ER tumors in the present study became even
  stronger after adjustment for age. Hormone receptor status was only available for
  65.4 % of the patients in the study by Li et al., versus 97.9 % in the present study.
  Coffee may be associated with smaller tumor size, and lack of tumor material for
  receptor analyses may have biased the association between coffee intake and ER status
  in the study by Li et al..\n\nAnother mechanism for the decreased risk of early
  events among coffee drinkers may be that coffee induces an increase in the plasma
  ratio of 2OHE/16OHE, which was also found among tamoxifen-treated patients in a
  pilot study of the present cohort. Tamoxifen metabolites deactivate the ER, but
  it is possible that tamoxifen is unable to deactivate all tumor ERs. A higher plasma
  ratio of 2OHE/16OHE may thus be favorable since 2OHE is a weak estrogen or may even
  act as an anti-estrogenic substance, while 16OHE is a potent estrogen with procarcinogenic
  effects and high affinity for the ER. A decreased level of 16OHE, mediated by coffee,
  may thus lead to a better effect of tamoxifen. Thibodeau found in 1998 that methotrexate
  resistance in MCF-7 breast cancer cells was inducted 88-fold by 16OHE and 33-fold
  by 2OHE. The effect of coffee on the response to chemotherapy may similarly be mediated
  through alternation in the 2OHE/16OHE ratio.\n\nMoreover, CYP1A2 is a key enzyme
  in the 2-hydroxylation of estrone and estradiol, in the metabolism of caffeine,
  and it contributes to tamoxifen metabolism. CYP2C8/9 also contributes to the metabolism
  of caffeine  and tamoxifen. CYP2C83 genotypes, which may influence CYP2C8 enzyme
  metabolic activity, have previously been associated with a higher risk for early
  breast cancer events in tamoxifen-treated patients, in a subset of the present cohort.
  Intake of caffeinated coffee may thus result in increased activation of tamoxifen
  via CYP1A2 or CYP2C8/9, a hypothesis consistent with our finding of fewer early
  events in tamoxifen-treated patients with ER+ tumors and moderate to high coffee
  consumption. Moreover, others have reported that carriers of the CYP1A21F A/A genotype
  but not the CYP1A21F C-allele who consume 3+ cups/day have a higher inducibility
  of CYP1A2 compared to non-consumers. This may explain the finding of an association
  between low coffee consumption in combination with at least one CYP1A2IF C-allele
  or CYP2C83 allele with an over threefold risk for early breast cancer events in
  tamoxifen-treated patients with ER+ tumors.\n\nCoffee consumption was associated
  with several potential confounders. Coffee intake and smoking have been shown to
  be associated. In the present study, current smoking was significantly associated
  with increasing coffee consumption, but not associated with early events. Increasing
  coffee consumption in the study population was also significantly associated with
  a decreasing frequency of alcohol abstainers. After adjustments for alcohol and
  smoking in the multivariate models, the association between coffee and risk for
  early events remained essentially the same. Use of HRT prior to diagnosis in this
  population was not significantly associated with either coffee consumption or risk
  for early events. Some studies have previously reported that HRT increases disease-free
  survival, while others have reported a higher mortality rate. None of these potential
  confounders could explain the results of this study. A recent publication based
  on this cohort reported that poor adherence was associated with early events. However,
  coffee intake was not associated with duration of endocrine therapy and could thus
  not explain the results.\n\nThe coffee variable and other potential risk factors
  were self-reported and may thus constitute an error in measurement. The definition
  of cup size was not further described, but the lack of precision regarding the actual
  coffee intake cannot explain the findings, since imprecision would bias the results
  toward the null hypothesis. However, the median coffee consumption in the study
  population was similar to the average coffee consumption in Sweden. The questionnaire
  did not include a question as to whether the coffee was caffeinated or decaffeinated.
  However, only a minority  of the coffee consumed in Sweden is decaffeinated. When
  reported coffee intake at the follow-up visits was used as the exposure variable,
  the association between coffee intake and risk for early events in tamoxifen-treated
  patients remained significant. Since the correlation between coffee consumption
  during the preoperative and follow-up visits was high, preoperative coffee intake
  reliably predicted postoperative coffee consumption. As there were few patients
  with no coffee consumption, zero cups/day group would have been a suboptimal reference
  group, especially for subgroup analyses. Instead, a 01 cup/day coffee consumption
  group was used as reference. The results for the groups with no coffee consumption
  and 1 cup/day were overlapping. Similarly, the survival rates for the 24 cups/day
  and 5+ cups/day were completely overlapping in the survival analyses.\n\nThe Skne
  University Hospital in Lund serves almost 300,000 inhabitants. Since patients are
  not referred to other hospitals for surgery, the study is population-based. During
  the time the cohort was compiled, 1,090 patients went through breast cancer surgery.
  Approximately 58 % of these patients were included in the study. Patients were mostly
  missed due to lack of available research nurses. However, included patients were
  similar to non-included patients regarding age and hormone receptor status. The
  follow-up rates were high. The overall response rate among patients who were alive
  and event-free was somewhat lower in patients with moderate to high coffee intake
  compared to low coffee intake. Since data on recurrences, new cancers, and deaths
  were retrieved from clinical charts and Swedish Registries, this means that there
  was a proportionally larger loss of patients that were still in remission in the
  group with moderate to high coffee intake. The difference in follow-up rates may
  therefore have biased the results toward the null. Clinical data and date of death
  were obtained from patients charts and the population registry and thus reliable.
  Therefore, the findings of this study are considered generalizable to breast cancer
  patients in Sweden. However, the follow-up time was approximately 5 years, and long-term
  effects of coffee consumption in breast cancer patients could not be evaluated.\n\nThe
  main finding of this study was that tamoxifen treatment combined with moderate to
  high coffee consumption was associated with less than half the risk of an early
  breast cancer event compared with low consumption. Furthermore, low coffee consumption
  combined with any CYP1A21F C-allele or CYP2C83 was associated with an over threefold
  risk for an early breast cancer event in tamoxifen-treated patients. These patients
  may benefit from more personalized treatment. We also found a strong association
  between moderate to high coffee consumption and hormone receptor status, which suggests
  that coffee may influence the expression of both ER and PgR and modulate the relationship
  between the two. If the main finding of this study is confirmed in an independent
  cohort, patients should be informed of the potential benefits of combining coffee
  consumption with tamoxifen treatment.\n\nThis work was supported by grants from
