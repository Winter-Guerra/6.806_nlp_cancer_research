  The present study aimed to investigate the dose response chemopreventive potential
  of allyl isothiocyanate against 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene induced mammary carcinogenesis
  in female Sprague-Dawley rats. Mammary tumor was induced by a single dose of DMBA
  injected subcutaneously near mammary gland. We observed reduced body weight and
  increased in total number of tumors, tumor incidence and tumor volume in DMBA-induced
  rats. We also observed decreased antioxidant status and increased lipid peroxidation
  in plasma and mammary tissues. Increased levels of CYP450, Cyt-b5 and decreased
  levels of phase II biotransformation enzymes noticed in liver and mammary tissues
  of DMBA-induced rats. Further, increased levels of lipid profile and lipoprotein
  were noticed. Whereas, decreased level of HDL in plasma and decreased levels of
  PL and FFA in mammary tissue. Oral administration of AITC different doses inhibited
  the tumor incidence and restored levels of biochemical markers. Biochemical findings
  are supported by histopathological studies. These results suggested that AITC at
  a dose of 20 mg/kg bw significantly exert chemopreventive potential against DMBA-induced
  mammary carcinogenesis.'
