# Diallyl Disulfide Suppresses SRC/Ras/ERK Signaling-Mediated Proliferation and Metastasis in Human Breast Cancer by Up-Regulating miR-34a

## Abstract

Diallyl disulfide (DADS) is one of the major volatile components of garlic oil. DADS has various biological properties, including anticancer, antiangiogenic, and antioxidant effects. However, the anticancer mechanisms of DADS in human breast cancer have not been elucidated, particularly in vivo. In this study, we demonstrated that the expression of miR-34a was up-regulated in DADS-treated MDA-MB-231 cells. miR-34a not only inhibited breast cancer growth but also enhanced the antitumor effect of DADS, both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, Src was identified as a target of miR-34a, with miR-34a inhibiting SRC expression and consequently triggering the suppression of the SRC/Ras/ERK pathway. These results suggest that DADS could be a promising anticancer agent for breast cancer. miR-34a may also demonstrate a potential gene therapy agent that could enhance the antitumor effects of DADS.

## Introduction

Breast cancer is the most common malignancy with the highest incidence rates among women worldwide. Poor response to chemotherapy remains a major clinical obstacle to the successful treatment of breast cancer [1]. Therefore, the research community must acquire a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of breast cancer to identify more effective drugs leading to better treatment for breast cancer patients.

Diallyl disulfide (DADS), one of the major organosulfur compounds in garlic, is recognized as part of a group of potential chemopreventive compounds [2]. In the last few years, more and more studies have demonstrated that DADS has anti-tumor activity in many types of tumor cells, including neuroblastoma [3], breast cancer [4]–[6], colon cancer [7], lung cancer [8] and gastric cancer cell lines [9], [10]. The mechanisms underlying this anticancer action of DADS include the activation of metabolizing enzymes that detoxify carcinogens, the suppression of DNA adduct formation, the inhibition of reactive oxygen species production, the regulation of cell cycle arrest and the induction of apoptosis [11]. However, the mechanism of the anti-tumor effect of DADS in breast cancer is not yet well understood.

MicroRNAs are a class of small non-coding RNAs (18~22 nt) that play vital roles in gene expression by binding to the 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) of target mRNAs, leading to mRNA cleavage or translational repression [12]. MicroRNAs regulate the expression of a wide variety of target genes and are therefore involved in a broad range of biological processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis [13], [14]. Mounting evidence has shown that miRNAs are dysregulated in breast cancer and might serve as oncogenes or tumor suppressors during tumorigenesis [15], [16]. Here we focus on miR-34a, which represents a promising topic in cancer research [17]. Previous studies have shown that the transcription of miR-34a is under the control of the tumor suppressor gene product p53 and that it acts as a tumor suppressor, inducing cell cycle arrest in G1 phase [18]–[20], senescence and apoptosis [21], [22] in several types of cancer, including breast cancer. The miR-34a expression level is closely related to the occurrence and progression of breast cancer [23]. In our previous study, we found that the level of miR-34a in MGC-803 cells was up-regulated more than 2-fold after DADS treatment compared with the DMSO control [9]. Therefore, we suggest that miR-34a may play a vital role in the anticancer action of DADS.

The aim of this study was to explore the mechanisms underlying the antitumor effect of DADS in breast cancer. miR-34a may indeed enhance the antitumor effects of diallyl disulfide. Furthermore, SRC was shown to be a target of miR-34a. Thus, we demonstrated that DADS suppresses SRC/Ras/ERK signaling-mediated proliferation and metastasis in human breast cancer through the up-regulation of miR-34a.

## Results

### DADS inhibits the proliferation and invasion of breast cancer cells in vitro

To examine whether DADS affects breast cancer cells, duration and dose-effect experiments were performed on human breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231) and a normal mammary epithelial cell line (MCF-10A). The results showed that DADS inhibited the proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells in a duration- and dose-concentration manner compared with the control (Fig. 1A). DADS did not inhibit the proliferation of MCF-10A cells (Fig. 1B). Wound-healing and Transwell assays were used to assess the impact of DADS on MDA-MB-231 cell migration and invasion. Both migration (Fig. 1C) and invasion (Fig. 1D) were significantly inhibited upon exposure to different concentrations of DADS.

The cells were counted in triplicate at the indicated time points, and the average growth rates were calculated. p&lt;0.05 vs. mock, p&lt;0.01 vs. mock.

### DADS inhibits growth and invasion by up-regulating miR-34a in breast cancer cells

In a previous study, we confirmed microarray expression data showing up-regulation of miR-34a by DADS treatment in gastric cancer cell lines [9]. Here, qRT-PCR was used to measure the expression of miR-34a in MDA-MB-231 cells exposed to 0, 25, 50, 100, 200 or 400 µM DADS for 48 h. miR-34a expression was up-regulated with increasing doses of DADS (Fig. 2A). Next, MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with a scramble miRNA control, miR-34a mimics or miR-34a plus 200 µM DADS and counted after 48 h. The results of this assay suggested that miR-34a mimics could inhibit MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation. The anti-proliferation effect was more obvious when the MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with miR-34a and treated with 200 µM DADS (Fig. 2B). The Transwell assay results showed that the combined treatment of miR-34a mimics with DADS synergistically inhibited breast cancer cell invasion (Fig. 2C).

### miR-34a enhanced the antitumor effect of DADS in a mouse xenograft model

Based on the in vitro studies, we hypothesized that miR-34a might repress breast cancer growth and enhance the antitumor effect of DADS in vivo. To address this critical question, we used an in vivo xenograft model. First, to determine whether DADS has therapeutic effects, MDA-MB-231 cells were subcutaneously injected into nude mice, and the tumors thereby generated were treated with DADS or mock. Tumor volumes were measured every 4 days. After 28 days, the mice were euthanized, and the xenografts were removed. The mean volume and weight of the tumors generated from the DADS group were significantly lower compared with the control group (Fig. 3A, 3B). Next, to explore whether miR-34a can enhance the effect of DADS, the mice were sorted into four different treatment groups (described in the methods section): scramble, miR-34a, mock, and DADS plus miR-34a. Compared with the scramble negative control-treated mice, treatment with miR-34a led to a reduced tumor volume. Furthermore, mice treated with DADS plus miR-34a had lower tumor volumes compared with the mock treatment group (Fig. 3C). The same differences were observed for tumor weight (Fig. 3D). These results collectively suggest that miR-34a may enhance the antitumor effect of DADS.

When the tumors were established, the effects of mock (an intraperitoneal injection of 100 µl PBS) and DADS (an intraperitoneal injection of 100 mg·kg−1 DADS in PBS) treatment on tumor volume were examined every 4 days. Average tumor volumes are represented (n = 5 for each experimental group) starting from the first injection and continuing until sacrifice 28 days later.

Average tumor volumes (n = 5 for each experimental group) are represented starting from the first injection and continuing until sacrifice 28 days later.

### miR-34a inhibits the SRC/Ras/ERK signaling pathway by targeting SRC

Bioinformatic analyses found that the SRC gene, among a number of others, may be a potential miR-34a target (Fig. 4A). We chose SRC for further analysis because it was predicted by online software and also previously implicated in promoting breast cancer progression [24]–[26]. Damiano [27] reported that SRC regulates the proliferation and motility of cancer cells by affecting the Ras/ERK signaling pathway. To confirm that miR-34a directly targets SRC, we performed luciferase reporter assays. The full-length SRC 3′UTR was cloned downstream of the firefly luciferase gene and co-transfected with miR-34a mimics or scrambled oligonucleotides. Luciferase activity was measured 48 h after transfection. We found that co-transfection of miR-34a and the wild-type SRC 3′UTR caused a significant decrease in luciferase expression compared with controls. However, co-transfection of miR-34a with the mutant SRC 3′UTR did not cause a decrease in luciferase expression (Fig. 4B). These results suggest that miR-34a can directly target SRC. To determine the level at which miR-34a influences SRC expression, we examined the expression of SRC mRNA after transfection with miR-34a mimics or scrambled oligonucleotides. As shown in Fig. 4C, after transfection with miR-34a mimics, the expression of SRC mRNA was significantly lower than in the controls.

(B) Luciferase reporter assays were performed after transfection with the indicated pMIR-Report plasmids and a renilla transfection control plasmid and upon co-transfection with miR-34a or the relevant scramble controls.

(C) SRC expression at both the protein and mRNA levels was much lower in MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with miR-34a mimics compared to scramble control cells.

Next, we performed Western blot analyses to determine whether miR-34a mediates its anti-tumorigenic effects on breast cancer through the SRC/Ras/ERK signaling pathway. First, we validated the effect of SRC activity on the Ras/ERK pathway in MDA-MB-231 cells. Based on previous reports [27], knockdown of SRC by siRNA-mediated RNA interference resulted in decreased SRC mRNA and protein levels, which led to decreased Ras-GTP and phosphorylated-ERK1/2 (Fig. 4D). Overexpression of SRC resulted in increased SRC mRNA and protein levels, leading to increased Ras-GTP and phosphorylated-ERK1/2 (Fig. 4D). We next investigated whether miR-34a induction would mimic the SRC reduction in suppressing the Ras/ERK signaling pathway. As anticipated, overexpression of miR-34a in MDA-MB-231 cells down-regulated SRC protein levels and resulted in less active Ras-GTP, leading to less phosphorylated ERK1/2 (Fig. 4D). The same changes were observed in the DADS group. These results suggest that Ras/ERK, as the signaling pathway downstream of SRC, may be tightly controlled by the miR-34a/SRC regulatory pathway.

## Discussion

Breast cancer is a group of heterogeneous diseases that show substantial variation in their molecular and clinical characteristics [28]. The use of traditional chemotherapeutic agents for breast cancer management often suffers from toxicity and resistance concerns. This emphasizes the need for the development of safer, natural, non-toxic compounds as chemotherapeutic/chemopreventive agents. In this study, we focused on DADS, the major organosulfur compound in garlic oil, which is known to lower the development of various cancers both in vitro and in vivo [29]–[31]. Over the past decade, the field of miRNA biology and their involvement in cancer have seen tremendous advances. miRNAs represent potential disease biomarkers and novel therapeutic targets. In breast cancer, several large-scale profiling studies have described altered miRNA expression patterns [32], [33] that vary with tumor type and the molecular pathways involved. In our previous report, we found that the anti-cancer effects of DADS may be related to miRNAs. In MGC-803 gastric cancer cells, seven miRNAs (miR-200b, miR-22, miR-143, miR-138, miR-34a, miR-7 and miR-150) were up-regulated, and five miRNAs (miR-222, miR-21, miR-15b, miR-182 and miR-18a) were down-regulated after DADS treatment compared with the DMSO control [9].

In this report, we show for the first time that DADS directly induces a tumor-suppressive miRNA, miR-34a, in breast cancer cells. miR-34a has been reported to act as a tumor-suppressive miRNA in many cancer types [22], [34], and miR-34a expression is down-regulated in various cancer cell lines. DADS inhibited the proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells in a time- and concentration-dependent manner compared with controls. Furthermore, migration and invasion were both significantly inhibited after exposure of MDA-MB-231 cells to different concentrations of DADS. We then used an in vivo mouse xenograft model to further test these important in vitro findings. As shown in Fig. 3A-D, DADS inhibited breast cancer growth by up-regulating miR-34a expression. To determine the molecular mechanisms underlying these actions, we further investigated the possible signaling pathways regulated by miR-34a. We performed an online search of miR-34a targets using Targetscan. Among the hundreds of putative miRNA targets, we focused on Src, which regulates key cellular processes, including proliferation, survival, adhesion and motility. Our hypothesis that miR-34a regulates Src was confirmed by luciferase reporter assays. SRC mRNA and protein levels were much lower in MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with miR-34a mimics relative to controls. In previous reports, Src was shown to channel signals through Ras/Raf/extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (Erk1/2). Elevated Src kinase activity has been reported in a wide range of human tumors, with Src activity increasing with disease progression [35], [36]. We further performed Western blot analysis of the protein levels of SRC, Ras-GTP, total Ras, phosphorylated ERK1/2, and ERK1/2 in MDA-MB-231 cells mock-treated or exposed to DADS and transfected with control or SRC siRNA, a control or SRC vector, or scramble or miR-34a mimics. The results demonstrated that Ras/ERK signaling is also regulated by miR-34a/SRC and show that altering miR-34a levels may represent a new possible target for regulating Ras/ERK activity in breast cancer. Inhibition of the SRC/Ras/ERK signaling pathway via miR-34a targeting SRC might enhance the anti-cancer effects of DADS in breast cancer cells.

Taken together, this study demonstrates that miR-34a may be required for the anti-cancer effects of DADS, both in human breast cancer cell lines and in xenograft models. Furthermore, SRC may be a critical target of miR-34a. DADS may therefore suppress proliferation and invasion in human breast cancer cells by up-regulating miR-34a and consequently reducing SRC/Ras/ERK signaling, indicating that miR-34a may serve as a potential gene therapy target for enhancing the antitumor effects of DADS in breast cancer therapy.

## Materials and Methods

### Cell lines and transfection

The following cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA) and were passaged in our laboratory for less than six months after thawing frozen aliquots: MDA-MB-231 and the normal mammary epithelial cell line MCF-10A. All cells were maintained according to the supplier's instructions. Before use, all cell lines were authenticated by short tandem repeat DNA profiling and were found to be free of mycoplasma infection. Plasmids, miRNAs, and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) were transfected into cells at the indicated concentrations using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

### Chemicals

DADS (purity 80%, the remaining 20% being diallyl trisulfide and diallyl sulfide) was purchased from Fluka Co. (Milwaukee, WI, USA), dissolved in Tween-80 at 1 M and stored at −20°C. Sodium butyrate (SB) was purchased from Sigma Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA), dissolved in PBS at 100 mM and stored at −20°C. This compound was used as the positive control.

### Cell proliferation assay

Cells treated with DADS or transfected with scramble or miR-34a mimics (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) were plated in 12-well plates at the desired cell concentrations. Cell counts were estimated by trypsinizing the cells at the indicated time points and counting triplicate samples with a Coulter Counter (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA, USA).

### Cell invasion and migration assays

Cell migration was examined by wound-healing assays. An artificial “wound” was created on a confluent cell monolayer. The scratch assay included treatment with 10 µg/ml mitomycin C for 2 h, and photographs were taken using an inverted microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) after 12, 24 and 48 h.

The cell invasion assay was conducted as described previously. Briefly, cells were seeded onto the basement membrane matrix present on the insert of a 24-well culture plate (EC matrix, Chemicon, Temecula, CA, USA). Fetal bovine serum was added to the lower chamber as a chemoattractant. After 48 h, the non-invading cells and the EC matrix were gently removed with a cotton swab. Invasive cells located on the lower side of the chamber were stained with crystal violet, counted and imaged.

### Plasmid construction and siRNA interference assay

An siRNA sequence targeting the human SRC cDNA was designed and synthesized by GenePharma (Shanghai, China). The siRNA sequence was 5′-CACUACAAGAUCCGGAAAC-3′. A scrambled siRNA was included as a negative control. A mammalian expression plasmid encoding the human SRC open reading frame (pReceiver-M02-SRC) was purchased from GeneCopoeia (Germantown, MD, USA). An empty plasmid served as the negative control. The SRC expression vector and SRC siRNA were transfected into MDA-MB-231 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA and protein were isolated 48 h post-transfection.

### Western blot and immunohistochemistry

Protein was extracted from gastric cancer cell lines using RIPA lysis buffer containing proteinase inhibitor. The protein concentration of the lysates was measured with the Protein BCA Assay Kit (Bio-Rad, USA). For the Western blot assay, 20 µg of protein mixed with 2×SDS loading buffer was loaded per lane, separated by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, USA). To block nonspecific binding, membranes were incubated at room temperature for 1 h with 5% skim milk powder, followed by a 12-h incubation at 4°C with antiserum containing antibodies against c-Src (B-12) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc-8056, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), p44/42 MAPK (Erk1/2; Thr202/Tyr204), total ERK, AKT, pRaf, and β-actin (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA, USA). Ras activity was detected using the Ras Activation Assay Kit from Upstate-Millipore (17–218). A peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:5000 dilution) and ECL Western blotting detection reagents (New England Biolabs, USA) were used to visualize the target proteins, which were quantified with a Bio Image Intelligent Quantifier 1-D (Version 2.2.1, Nihon-BioImage Ltd., Japan). An anti-β-actin antibody (Boster, Wuhan, China) was used as a protein loading control.

### Dual-luciferase reporter assay and 3′UTR binding site mutagenesis

MDA-MB-231 cells (6×104) were seeded in 24-well plates immediately prior to transfection. pMIR-Mcl1 and pMIR-Mcl1-mut were transfected into the MDA-MB-231 cells using Lipo2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. The miR-34a mimic was co-transfected where indicated. Cells were assayed for both firefly and renilla luciferase using the dual luciferase glow assay (Promega) 48 h post-transfection. Transfection experiments were performed in duplicate and repeated at least thrice in independent experiments.

### In vivo tumorigenicity study

MDA-MB-231 cells were subcutaneously injected into 4-week-old male Balb/c nude mice. The mice were then treated with intratumoral injections of scramble miRNA (40 µl of the negative control miRNA) or miR-34a (40 µl of the miR-34a mimics) in PBS or with mock (an intraperitoneal injection of 100 µl PBS plus an intratumoral injection of 40 µl negative control miRNA), DADS (an intraperitoneal injection of 100 mg·kg−1 DADS plus an intratumoral injection of 40 µl of the negative control miRNA) or DADS+34a (an intraperitoneal injection of 100 mg·kg−1 DADS plus an intratumoral injection of 40 µl of the miR-34a mimics) in PBS. Tumor volumes were examined every 4 days. Average tumor volumes are represented (n = 5 for both experimental groups) starting from the first injection and continuing until sacrifice 28 days later. The xenografts were removed, and tumor diameters and weights were measured and documented at 28 days. Tumor volume (mm3) was estimated by measuring the longest and shortest diameters of the tumor and calculating as follows: volume = (shortest diameter)2 × (longest diameter) ×0.5. The animal handling and all experimental procedures were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of the University of South China.

### Statistical analysis

Differences between groups were tested by Student's _t_-test or one-way ANOVA using the SPSS 16.0 program. A _p_-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
