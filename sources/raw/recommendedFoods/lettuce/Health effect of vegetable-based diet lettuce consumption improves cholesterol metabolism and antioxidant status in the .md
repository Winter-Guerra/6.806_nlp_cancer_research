# Health effect of vegetable-based diet: lettuce consumption improves cholesterol metabolism and antioxidant status in the rat

## Abstract

_Background &amp; aims_: It is often assumed that fruits and vegetables contribute to protect against degenerative pathologies such as cardiovascular diseases. Besides epidemiological observations, scientific evidences for their mechanism of action are scarce. In the present study, we investigated the mean term and post-prandial effects of lettuce ingestion on lipid metabolism and antioxidant protection in the rat.
