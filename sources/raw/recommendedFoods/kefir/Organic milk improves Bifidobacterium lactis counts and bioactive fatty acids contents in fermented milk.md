# Organic milk improves Bifidobacterium lactis counts and bioactive fatty acids contents in fermented milk

## Abstract

In functional dairy products, polyunsaturated fatty acids such as, conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) and Î±-linolenic acid (ALA) have been highlighted for their benefits related to prevention of some chronic diseases. In order to study the effect of type of milk (conventional _vs._ organic, characterized by a specific fatty acid composition), _Bifidobacterium animalis_ subsp. _lactis_ (BB12, B94, BL04 and HN019) counts, acidification activity and chemical composition (pH, lactose, lactic acid contents and fatty acids profile) were investigated before fermentation and after 24 h of products stored at 4 °C. Organic and conventional milk influenced acidification performance and bacteria counts, which was strain-dependent. Higher counts of BB12 were observed in organic milk, whereas superior counts of BL04 were found in conventional milk. Organic fermented milk showed lower levels in saturated fatty acids (FA) and higher in monounsaturated FA contents. Similarly, among bioactive FA, organic fermented milks have higher amounts of _trans_ vaccenic acid (TVA-C18:1t), conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) and slightly higher contents of Î±-linoleic acid (ALA).
