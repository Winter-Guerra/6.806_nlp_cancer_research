# Concentrated green tea extract induces severe acute hepatitis in a 63-year-old woman - A case report with pharmaceutical analysis

## Abstract

_Etnopharmacological Relevance:_ The popularity of concentrated green tea extracts as dietary supplements for a wide range of applications is increasing due to their health-promoting effects attributed to the high amounts of catechins they contain. The most important of the green tea catechins is (−)-epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate (EGCG). While their beneficiary effects have been studied extensively, a small number of adverse events have been reported in the medical literature. Here we present a typical reversible course of severe hepatitis after green tea consumption.
