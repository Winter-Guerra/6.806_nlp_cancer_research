#  Cranberries are recommended for breast cancer 

Cranberries contain among the highest concentration of antioxidants per serving size of all fruits. They are a good source of phytochemicals that include flavonol glycosides, anthocyanins, proanthocyanidins, resveratrol, and organic and phenolic acids. Cranberries are also a good dietary source of the lignan enterolactone.

## Breast cancer-related effects of eating cranberries 

Cranberries have been shown to have antiproliferative activity against cancer in vitro and in vivo and to induce apoptosis. When fed to mice bearing human breast cancer cells, cranberry presscake (the material remaining after squeezing juice from the berries) has been shown to decrease the growth and metastasis of the tumors.

Cranberries are a good source of resveratrol, which has been shown to increase the effects of radiation treatment, aromatase inhibitors and the chemotherapy drug Taxol (paclitaxel) against breast cancer.
