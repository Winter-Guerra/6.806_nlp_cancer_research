#  Artichokes are recommended for breast cancer 

Artichokes (Cynara scolymus), otherwise known as globe artichokes, are a member of the thistle family. Artichokes are a good dietary source of phosphorus, magnesium, iron, niacin, vitamin B1 and vitamin B2, and also include some folate, manganese, and zinc. Artichokes also contain apigenin, luteolin, silibinin, chlorogenic acid, cynarin, caffeic acid, ferulic acid, several anthocyanins, and oligofructose compounds such as inulin, most of which have been reported to have anti-cancer properties. Artichokes have been shown to have antioxidant, antifungal, antigenotoxic, liver-protective and hypoglycemic activities, as well as reducing cholesterol and ameliorating indigestion and irritable bowel syndrome.

## Breast cancer-related effects of eating artichokes 

Artichoke extract has been shown to inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis (programmed cell death) in triple negative (ER-/PR-/HER2-) breast cancer cells in the laboratory. Flavone components of artichoke (apigenin and luteolin) have been shown to induce apoptosis across a variety of breast cancer cell lines. Silibinin has been shown to induce apoptosis in both triple negative and hormone receptor positive (ER+/PR+) breast cancer cells. Silibinin has also been shown to reduce the degree of stem cell-like properties of clusters of triple negative cells. In addition, silibinin has been shown to suppress ER+/PR+ breast cancer cell migration.

An Italian population study found that the risk of breast cancer was reduced for increasing intake of apigenin and luteolin, among other flavones. However, no population studies have specifically evaluated the impact of consuming artichokes on the risk of breast cancer.

## Additional comments

### Milk thistle

Milk thistle (Silybum marianum), a herb related to the artichoke, traditionally has been used for its liver-protective properties, but increasingly is being used by cancer patients. Milk thistle is the best known source of the compound flavonoid silymarin, which contains silibinin, silybin, silicristin, silidianin and related compounds. Silibinin is the most biologically active component of silymarin. However, silybin has also been shown to inhibit growth and induce apoptosis in human breast cancer cells and HER2/neu overexpressing mammary tumors in a mouse model. Silymarin has been shown to have a synergistic effect with Adriamycin (doxorubicin), increasing its treatment effects.

However, one study found that treatment of human breast cancer tumor grafts in rodents with silymarin isolated from milk thistle stimulated tumor growth. Therefore, we caution breast cancer patients, survivors and those at high risk against taking concentrated milk thistle, artichoke or silymarin supplements.

### Other artichokes

Cardoon (Cynara cardunculus), also known as artichoke thistle or wild artichoke, is an edible thistle-like plant native to the Mediterranean. Jerusalem artichokes (Helianthus tuberosus) are part of the sunflower family and are not related to artichokes.
