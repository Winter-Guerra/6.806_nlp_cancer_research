#  Broccoli is highly recommended for breast cancer 

Broccoli and broccoli sprouts have been shown to suppress inflammation and to be cardioprotective. In addition, broccoli can inhibit urinary bladder carcinogenesis, and reduce the risk of occurrence of multiple myeloma and lung, gallbladder, ovarian, cervical, stomach, prostate, small intestine and colorectal cancer.

## Breast cancer-related effects of eating broccoli 

Broccoli contains numerous substances with suspected or demonstrated cancer fighting properties, including sulforaphane, quercetin, sinigrin, enterolactone, kaempferol glycosides, beta-carotene, indole-3-carbinol (I3C), 3,3'-diindolylmethane (DIM), and several other glucosinolates. Broccoli has been found to promote apoptosis, suppress cell cycle progression and inhibit angiogenesis of human breast cancer cells. Consumption of broccoli has been shown to reduce the estrogen metabolite 16alpha-hydroxyestrone, which is a breast cancer promoter, and to be marginally inversely associated with breast cancer risk in a population of premenopausal women. Broccoli components quercetin, I3C and sulforaphane have all been shown increase the anti-cancer effects of the chemotherapy drug Taxol (paclitaxel). Broccoli sprouts are particularly rich in anticancer nutrients.

## Additional comments

Broccoli sprouts generally are safer to eat compared to some other sprouts (for example, alfalfa sprouts, which have been linked to a number of food-borne disease outbreaks due to salmonella and E. coli). Stir frying preserves most of the presumed cancer-fighting chemicals in broccoli whereas after boiling only 14-28% of the individual glucosides are retained in the cooked tissue (most of the remainder being leached into the water). Similarly, if broccoli is microwaved, it should be done for the shortest period of time and with the least amount of water possible to minimize leaching of phenolic compounds and glucosinolates into water. Even the light blanching used in making frozen broccoli substantially reduces the bioavailability of sulforaphane.

We recommend consuming broccoli as food and against consuming broccoli pills that have been enhanced to boost the proportion of the presumed key anti-cancer chemicals in broccoli. There is some evidence that concentrated cruciferous vegetable extracts can act as estrogen agonists and promote breast cancer cell proliferation. Also, the anticancer properties of broccoli are likely to be the result of synergistic interaction of its various chemical components - isolated components have successfully inhibited proliferation in the laboratory, but their efficacy and safety in humans needs to be evaluated in large scale clinical trials.

Cruciferous vegetables contain thioglucoside compounds that can interfere with the formation of thyroid hormone.
