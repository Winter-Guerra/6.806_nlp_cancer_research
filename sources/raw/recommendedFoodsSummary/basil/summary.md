Basil contains numerous volatile compounds and other substances that have powerful antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and antifungal properties. Basil may help alleviate type 2 diabetes by improving insulin activity in the body. Carnosol, a component of basil, has been shown to inhibit carcinogenesis of human prostate cancer cells. While the evidence is mixed as to whether basil can retard liver tumor formation in experimental mice, it has been shown to inhibit liver cancer metastasis. Basil leaf extract has been found to be highly effective in inhibiting carcinogen-induced lung tumor incidence in experimental mice. Basil oil and its components have been shown to have significant anti-proliferative activity in the mouse leukemia and kidney cells. In addition, basil oil has been found to significantly inhibit carcinogen-induced squamous cell carcinoma in the stomachs of experimental mice.

## Breast cancer-related effects of eating basil 

Basil extract has been shown to induce apoptosis (programmed cell death) in both hormone receptor positive (ER+/PR+) and triple negative (ER-/PR-/HER2-) breast cancer cells. Linalool, a component of basil, has been found to increase Adriamycin (doxorubicin) induced cytotoxicity and pro-apoptotic effects in chemotherapy-resistant breast cancer cell lines.

## Additional comments

While they are closely related, basil (Ocimum basilicum), otherwise known as sweet basil, is not exactly the same plant as holy basil (Ocimum sanctum). Fresh or dried basil typically is used as a food ingredient, whereas holy basil normally is consumed as a herb in the U.S. When basil is used as a food ingredient, it is safe, but an essential oil from basil might cause cancer in extremely large quantities since it contains estragole. Estragole is an organic compound that acts as a rodent carcinogen in large doses. The percentage content of estragole in basil oil can be significant. Pesto sauce, which has basil as the primary ingredient, can also have a significant estragole component. Therefore, we recommend against consuming all but small amounts of basil essential oil or pesto.
