#  Raspberries are highly recommended for breast cancer 

Raspberries are rich in phenolic phytochemicals, including ellagitannin and anthocyanins, which have been shown to have anti-inflammatory, chemopreventive, antiproliferative and proapoptic effects. Raspberries are also a good dietary source of the lignan enterolactone.

## Breast cancer-related effects of eating raspberries 

Raspberry powder has been shown to have antiproliferative effects when fed to female rats prone to mammary tumors. Black raspberries appear to have more cancer-preventative chemicals than the closely-related red raspberries. Studies that have compared blueberry and black raspberry diets in rats have found that while blueberries result in lower tumor volume than black raspberries, black raspberries are more effective in delaying the first appearance of tumors in rats implanted with estradiol.

Ellagic acid, found in raspberries, has been shown to inhibit breast cancer in cell and animal studies, in part by inhibiting angiogenesis. Cancer cells induce angiogenesis during the early stages of tumor development Â— this is a crucial step that separates preinvasive and dormant forms of cancer from invasive and metastatic malignant growth.

## Additional comments

Non-organic raspberries must be washed very thoroughly to remove pesticide residue. Loganberries are a hybrid cross between between a blackberry and a raspberry.
