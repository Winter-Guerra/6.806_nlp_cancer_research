Like kale, broccoli, and horseradish, watercress (Nasturtium officinale) is a brassica vegetable. Watercress is a good dietary source of vitamin C, vitamin A, vitamin K, calcium, and various other minerals. Watercress has been shown to have antioxidant, antigenotoxic, and anti-inflammatory properties, and to improve cholesterol profile. Watercress contains beta-carotene, lutein, zeaxanthin, kaempferol, nasturtiin (the precursor of phenethyl isothiocyanate), phenylethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC) and various other isothiocyanates, all of which have been reported to have anti-cancer properties. Brassica vegetables have been shown to inhibit the growth of human pancreatic cancer cells and to reduce the risk of occurrence of lung, gallbladder, bladder, prostate, ovarian and colorectal cancer.

## Breast cancer-related effects of eating watercress 

Various isothiocyanates derived from watercress have been found to have chemopreventive activity against a variety of breast cancer cell lines in the laboratory and in epidemiologic studies. A Chinese study which measured urinary isothiocyanate levels as a marker of brassica vegetable intake found that higher levels were protective against breast cancer in both premenopausal and postmenopausal women.

Watercress is the most abundant dietary source of PEITC, which has been found to reduce the growth of human breast cancer cells, decrease angiogenesis (the process by which tumors send out signals to induce surrounding normal tissues to grow new blood vessels into the tumor), inhibit the growth of HER2 overexpressing (HER2+) mammary tumors in mice, and inhibit metastasis to the brain in a mouse model of breast cancer.

## Additional comments

Watercress can take the place of lettuce in salads or sandwiches. It should be eaten raw rather than cooked to obtain the most powerful anti-cancer effects.

Watercress can reduce the bioavailability of iodine in the diet. Cruciferous vegetables contain thioglucoside compounds that can interfere with the formation of thyroid hormone.
