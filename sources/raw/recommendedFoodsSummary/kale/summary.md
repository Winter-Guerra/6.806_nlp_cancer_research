Kale has the highest levels of vitamins of all cruciferous vegetables (a vegetable group that also includes broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, collard greens and brussels sprouts). Kale contains significant levels of vitamin C, vitamin A, vitamin B6, vitamin K, calcium, iron and various other minerals. Kale is also a good dietary source of the lignan enterolactone. Kale has been shown to have antioxidant, antigenotoxic, anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties, and to be cardioprotective. Kale contains beta-carotene, lutein and other carotenoids, quercetin, ferulic acid, caffeic acid, selenium, kaempferol, indole-3-carbinol (I3C), 3,3'-diindolylmethane (DIM) and several other isothiocyanates, sinigrin and other glucosinolate hydrolysis products, most of which have been reported to have anti-cancer properties. Kale and cruciferous vegetables more generally have been shown to inhibit the growth of human pancreatic cancer cells and to reduce the risk of occurrence of lung, gallbladder, bladder, prostate, ovarian and colorectal cancer.

## Breast cancer-related effects of eating kale 

Components of kale have been found to down-regulate hormone receptor expression, promote apoptosis, suppress cell cycle progression and inhibit angiogenesis of human breast cancer cells. Consumption of brassica vegetables has been shown to reduce the estrogen metabolite 16alpha-hydroxyestrone, which is a breast cancer promoter, and to be marginally inversely associated with breast cancer risk in population studies. A Korean study found an association between kale consumption and lower incidence of breast cancer. Kale components quercetin and I3C have been shown increase the anti-cancer effects of the chemotherapy drug Taxol (paclitaxel).

## Additional comments

Kale is healthiest when prepared by steaming and not by stir-frying. Non-organic kale must be washed very thoroughly to remove pesticide residue. Kale can reduce the bioavailability of iodine in the diet.

We recommend consuming kale and other cruciferous vegetables as food and against consuming components of them as pills (e.g. DIM pills). There is some evidence that concentrated cruciferous vegetable extracts can act as estrogen agonists and promote breast cancer cell proliferation. Also, the anticancer properties of kale are likely to be the result of synergistic interaction of its various chemical components - isolated components have successfully inhibited proliferation in the laboratory, but their efficacy and safety in humans needs to be evaluated in large scale clinical trials.

Cruciferous vegetables contain thioglucoside compounds that can interfere with the formation of thyroid hormone.
