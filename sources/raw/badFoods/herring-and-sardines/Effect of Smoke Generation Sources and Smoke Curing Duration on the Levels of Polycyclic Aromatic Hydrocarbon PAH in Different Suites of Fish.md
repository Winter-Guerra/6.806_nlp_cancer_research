# Effect of Smoke Generation Sources and Smoke Curing Duration on the Levels of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH) in Different Suites of Fish

## Abstract

The research studied the impact of smoke generation sources on PAH contamination in four different smoke-cured fish (mackerel, sardine, tuna and Cigar minnows). The smoke sources used included acacia, sugarcane bagasse and mangrove. PAHs in the smoke-cured fish were analysed using Varian GC/MS (3800-GC) system. The mean total PAH concentrations in the smoked fish (_n_ = 108) ranged from 250.59-1376.09 Î¼g/kg in tuna, cigar minnows, sardine and mackerel smoke-cured with sugarcane bagasse, mangrove and acacia for between 2 and 8 h. The mean BaP levels for most fish cured with smoke from acacia and mangrove for between 2 and 8 h were all above the European Commission set limit of 5.0 Î¼g/kg. Positive correlations (at _P_ = 0.01, 2-tailed) were observed between PAH levels in smoked fish and lignin contents of wood type used for the smoke generation, the fat content and the smoke-curing duration. Risk assessment conducted using benzo[a]pyrene carcinogenic and mutagenic toxicity equivalency factors (TEF and MEF respectively) showed high risk associated with consuming fish smoke-cured with hard woods (acacia and mangroves). Sugarcane bagasse was found to be relatively the best and safest smoke-generating source for smoke-curing of fish among the three wood types when using the traditional kiln.
