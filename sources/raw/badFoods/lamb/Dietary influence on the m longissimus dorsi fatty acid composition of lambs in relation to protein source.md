# Dietary influence on the m. longissimus dorsi fatty acid composition of lambs in relation to protein source

## Abstract

Dietary lipid effect, as a consequence of protein supplement, on lamb m. _longissimus dorsi_ fatty acid composition was investigated, with emphasis on biohydrogenation intermediates. Crossbred lambs (White Swedish Landrace Ã— Texel) were fed a barley-based diet without (CON) or with protein supplements including peas (PEA), rapeseed cake (RC) or hempseed cake (HC). The HC diet resulted in the highest muscle 22:6n-3 proportion, with the RC diet being similar (P &lt; 0.05). Protein supplement did not affect the _c_9,_t_11 conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) proportion, however the HC diet increased some minor CLA isomers, including _t_10,_c_12 CLA (P &lt; 0.05). The _t_10-18:1 and total _trans_-18:1 were lowest for the RC diet (P &lt; 0.05), likely relating to rumen conditions and precursor availability. The saturated, monounsaturated and branched-chain fatty acids were largely unaffected by protein supplement. In conclusion, feeding the RC diet lowered the _t_10-18:1 and total _trans_-18:1 in meat, and modestly increased 22:6n-3 content. The direction of these changes would be beneficial, making the RC diet the preferred protein supplement; however the magnitude of the changes in the present experiment may not be sufficient to have an impact on human health.
