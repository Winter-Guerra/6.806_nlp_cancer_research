- Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), the major polyphenolic constituent of green tea,
  is a potent antioxidant and free radical scavenger that may have therapeutic applications
  for the treatment of many disorders.
- Radiation therapy is widely used for the treatment of various types of cancers;
  however, radiation-induced skin injury remains a serious concern.
- EGCG has not yet been reported as protecting skin cells against ionizing radiation.
- In the present study, we investigated whether EGCG confers cytoprotection against
  ionizing radiation.
- We found that, compared with the control, pretreatment with EGCG significantly enhanced
  the viability of human skin cells that were irradiated with X-rays, and decreased
  apoptosis induced by X-ray irradiation.
- Mito-Tracker assay showed that EGCG suppressed the damage to mitochondria induced
  by ionizing radiation via upregulation of SOD2.
- Reactive oxygen species (ROS) in HaCaT cells were significantly reduced when pretreated
  with EGCG before irradiation.
- Radiation-induced Î³H2AX foci, which are representative of DNA double-strand breaks,
  were decreased by pretreatment with EGCG.
- Furthermore, EGCG induced the expression of the cytoprotective molecule heme oxygenase-1
  (HO-1) in a dose-dependent manner via transcriptional activation.
- HO-1 knockdown or treatment with the HO-1 inhibitor tin protoporphyrin (SnPPIX)
  reversed the protective role of EGCG, indicating an important role for HO-1.
- These results suggest that EGCG offers a new strategy for protecting skin against
  ionizing radiation.
