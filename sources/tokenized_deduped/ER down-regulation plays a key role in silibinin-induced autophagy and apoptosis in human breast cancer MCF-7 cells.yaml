- The estrogen receptor alpha (ERÎ±) has been proven to be one of the most important
  therapeutic targets in breast cancer over the last 30 years.
- Previous studies pointed out that a natural flavonoid, silibinin, induced apoptosis
  in human breast cancer MCF-7 cells.
- In the present study we report that exposure of MCF-7 cells to silibinin led to
  cell death through the down-regulation of ERÎ± expression.
- Silibinin-induced apoptosis of MCF-7 cells through up-regulation of caspase 6 due
  to ERÎ± signalling repression was further boosted by ERÎ± antagonist.
- Moreover, up-regulation of autophagy induced by silibinin accounted for apoptotic
  exacerbation, being further enhanced by ERÎ± inhibition.
- Upon ERÎ± activation, series of downstream signalling pathways can be activated.
- We found that silibinin reduced the expressions of Akt/mTOR and extracellular-signal-related
  kinase (ERK), which respectively accounted for the induction of autophagy and apoptosis.
- These effects were further augmented by co-treatment with ERÎ± inhibitor.
- We conclude that the treatment with silibinin of ERÎ±-positive MCF-7 cells down-regulates
  the expression of ERÎ±, and subsequently mTOR and ERK signaling pathways, ERÎ± downstream,
  finally resulting in induction of autophagy and apoptosis.
