- In this work the antiproliferative activity of pectic substances obtained by different
  extraction methods from defatted rapeseed cake was assessed on cancer cell lines.
- The process consisted of sequential treatment with alkalized water (pH ∼ 8), EDTA
  (0.01 M), alkaline protease (Alkalase 2.4L) and a commercial pectinase preparation
  (Viscozyme L or Pectinex Ultra SP-L).
- Pectic extracts identification was performed using spectroscopy and chromatography
  techniques.
- FT-IR and HPLC-IR results suggest that the neutral pectic extracts produced would
  be arabinogalactans and Î²-galactans.
- All the pectic substances extracted (acid and neutral) from RSC exhibited antiproliferative
  activity, being more effective on MCF-7 cells than Caco-2.
- The most effective pectic extract was obtained by Alkalase 2.4 L which killed over
  80% of MCF-7 cells and 60% of Caco-2 cells.
- At less than 10 mg/mL pectic extracts enriched in neutral sugars also exhibited
  antiproliferative activity (50 and 40%, respectively), which was superior to the
  modified citric pectins activity at the same concentration for the breast cancer
  cell line (61.6% for MCF-7 and 49.9% for Caco-2 cells).
- These results show that the antiproliferative activity depends on both the type
  of pectin (acid or neutral) and the extraction procedure.
