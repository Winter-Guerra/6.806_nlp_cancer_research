- Green tea (_Camellia sinensis_) is an extremely popular beverage worldwide.
- Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) is one of the major catechins isolated from green
  tea and contributes to its beneficial therapeutic functions including antioxidant,
  anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer effects.
- However, the effect of EGCG on mastitis is not yet known.
- This study was to investigate the protective potential of EGCG against mastitis
  in rats.
- The rat mastitis model was induced by injecting lipopolysaccharide (LPS) into the
  duct of mammary gland.
- The mammary gland was collected after the experimental period.
- The levels of mammary oxidative stress and inflammatory responses were assessed
  by measuring the local activities of antioxidant enzymes and the levels of inflammatory
  cytokines.
- The mammary expressions of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), nuclear factor
  ÎºB-p65 (NFÎºB-p65) and hypoxia-inducible factor-1Î± (HIF-1Î±) were evaluated by
  western blot analysis.
- It was found that EGCG obviously normalized LPS-induced low activities of antioxidant
  enzymes as well as decreased the high levels of inflammatory cytokines.
- Additionally, EGCG inhibited the mammary over-expression of MAPKs, NFÎºB-p65 and
  HIF-1Î±.
- These results indicated that EGCG was able to attenuate LPS-induced mastitis in
  rats by suppressing MAPK related oxidative stress and inflammatory responses.
