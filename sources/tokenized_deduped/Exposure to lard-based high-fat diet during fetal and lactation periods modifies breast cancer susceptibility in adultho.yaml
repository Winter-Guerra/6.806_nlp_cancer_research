- The present study investigated whether early life exposure to high levels of animal
  fat increases breast cancer risk in adulthood in rats.
- Dams consumed a lard-based high-fat (HF) diet (60% fat-derived energy) or an AIN93G
  control diet (16% fat-derived energy) during gestation or gestation and lactation.
- Their 7-week-old female offspring were exposed to 7,12-dimethyl-benzo[_a_]anthracene
  to induce mammary tumors.
- Pregnant dams consuming an HF diet had higher circulating leptin levels than pregnant
  control dams.
- However, compared to the control offspring, significantly lower susceptibility to
  mammary cancer development was observed in the offspring of dams fed an HF diet
  during pregnancy (lower tumor incidence, multiplicity and weight), or pregnancy
  and lactation (lower tumor multiplicity only).
- Mammary epithelial elongation, cell proliferation (Ki67) and expression of NFÎºB
  p65 were significantly lower and p21 expression and global H3K9me3 levels were higher
  in the mammary glands of rats exposed to an HF lard diet _in utero._ They also tended
  to have lower _Rank_/_Rankl_ ratios (_P_=.09) and serum progesterone levels (_P_=.07)
  than control offspring.
- In the mammary glands of offspring of dams consuming an HF diet during both pregnancy
  and lactation, the number of terminal end buds, epithelial elongation and the BCL-2/BAX
  ratio were significantly lower and serum leptin levels were higher than in the controls.
- Our data confirm that the breast cancer risk of offspring can be programmed by maternal
  dietary intake.
- However, contrary to our expectation, exposure to high levels of lard during early
  life decreased later susceptibility to breast cancer.
