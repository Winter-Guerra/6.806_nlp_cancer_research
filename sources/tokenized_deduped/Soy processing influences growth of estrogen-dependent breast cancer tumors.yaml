- Soy-based products consumed in Asian countries are minimally processed whereas in
  the USA many of the soy foods and soy ingredients are highly processed.
- Soy foods contain complex mixtures of bioactive compounds, which may interact with
  one another.
- The objective of this study was to evaluate the ability of various soy products
  containing genistin, the glycoside form of genistein, to affect growth of MCF-7
  cells transplanted into ovariectomized athymic mice.
- Products investigated included soy flour, two crude extracts of soy (soy molasses
  and Novasoy®), a mixture of isoflavones and genistin in pure form.
- Each of the soy flour-processed products was added to the diet to provide equivalent
  amounts of genistein aglycone equivalents (750 p.p.m.).
- Tumors in the negative control animals regressed throughout the study while the
  tumors in the soy flour-fed animals remained basically the same size (neither grew
  nor regressed).
- In animals consuming soy molasses, Novasoy®, mixed isoflavones or genistin alone,
  tumor growth was stimulated when compared with animals consuming a control diet
  devoid of soy.
- These same dietary treatments resulted in increased cellular proliferation.
- Changes in mRNA expression of gene targets (estrogen responsiveness, cell cycle
  progression, apoptosis and aromatase activity) in tumors induced by the different
  diets were evaluated.
- The relative expression of pS2, progesterone receptor and cyclin D1 was increased
  in animals consuming the Novasoy®, mixed isoflavones and genistin.
- Bcl2 mRNA expression was low in most of the dietary treatment groups compared with
  positive (estradiol implant) controls.
- Aromatase expression was not affected in any of the treatment groups.
- The degree of soy flour processing affects the estrogenicity of products containing
  a constant amount of genistein.
- Collectively, these findings suggest that for postmenopausal women with estrogen-dependent
  breast cancer, the consumption of foods containing soy flour is more advisable than
  consuming isoflavones in more purified forms.
