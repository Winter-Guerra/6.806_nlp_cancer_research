- Three antioxidant fractions (Fr1, Fr2 and Fr3) were separated by solid phase extraction
  from dried bilberry (_Vaccinium myrtillus_ L.) and tested for antioxidant and antiproliferative
  activity.
- Vitamin C (1.02 mg/100 g) was identified in Fr1, six flavonoids in Fr2 and eight
  phenolic acids in Fr3.
- The most abundant compounds in Fr2 and Fr3 were quercetin (243.3 mg/100 g dried
  bilberry) and _p-  _coumaric acid (57.87 mg/100 g dried bilberry), respectively.
- The best free radical scavenging activity on hydroxyl radicals was expressed by
  Fr3 (EC50⋅OH = 0.117 mg/ml), and on 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrihydrazyl (DPPH) radicals
  by Fr2 (EC50DPPH⋅ = 0.025 mg/ml).
- Considering the kinetic behaviour, tested by spectrophotometrical DPPH method, the
  highest antiradical efficiency (AE = 19.82 ml/mg × min) was demonstrated by Fr2.
- Fr2 and Fr3 significantly inhibited the growth of cervix epitheloid carcinoma, breast
  adenocarcinoma and colon adenocarcinoma cell lines, with IC50 ranging from 125.80
  to 300.48 Î¼g/ml.
- Dried bilberry possesses beneficial effects in prevention of cancer and diseases
  which have been attributed to free radical production.
