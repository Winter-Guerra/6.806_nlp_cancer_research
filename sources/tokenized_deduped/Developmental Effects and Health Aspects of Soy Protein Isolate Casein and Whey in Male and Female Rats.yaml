- Dietary factors other than the traditional nutrients are found in the so-called
  functional foods.
- They are becoming increasingly recognized as potentially important for maintaining
  good health.
- Soybeans are rich in such factors thought to help prevent certain chronic diseases.
- Soy protein isolate (SPI) is one of the three major proteins used in infant formulas
  sold in the United States, with casein (CAS) and whey (WPH) proteins being the others.
- We have been studying the health effects of these proteins.
- Safety concerns have developed over the consumption of soy-based infant formula,
  partly because of the high circulating levels of the total isoflavones (phytoestrogens)
  during “critical periods of infant development.” There is a paucity of data on developmental,
  physiological, neurophysiological, behavioral, metabolic, or molecular effects of
  soy phytochemicals in humans, especially during pregnancy and infancy.
- We have studied the effects of CAS, SPI, and WPH in short-term, long-term, and multigenerational
  studies in rats.
- Aside from minor differences in body weight gain profiles, CAS-, SPI-or WPH-fed
  rats did not differ in development, organ weights, in vitro hepatic metabolism of
  testosterone (T), or reproductive performance.
- However, some endocrine-related functions differed between rats fed these proteins.
- We found that SPI accelerated puberty in female rats (_p_ &lt;.05) and WPH delayed
  puberty in males and females, as compared with CAS (_p_ &lt;.05).
- Gender differences were also found in gonadectomy-induced steroid responses.
- Male rats had normal serum T levels, but female rats fed SPI had reduced serum 17β-estradiol
  concentrations and a blunted 17β-estradiol response to ovariectomy, as compared
  to rats fed CAS or WHP (_p_ &lt;.05).
- Female rats fed SPI or WHP or treated with genistein had reduced incidence of chemically
  induced mammary cancers (_p_ &lt;.05) compared to CAS controls, with WHP reducing
  tumor incidence by as much as 50%, findings that replicate previous results from
  our laboratory.
- Together, these results suggest gender-specific differences in development and certain
  endocrine responses among rats fed diets composed of a single protein source such
  as those used in infant formulas.
- Whether similar developmental effects occur in human infants is unknown, but unlikely
  because (1) most infants do not consume such diets throughout life as these rats
  did, and (2) no such effects have been reported in millions of American infants
  fed infant formula containing these proteins.
- The long-term health consequence implications of early diet exposure to SPI and
  WPH, such as reduced breast cancer incidence, are likely to be very positive.
