- Cell migration plays an important role in angiogenesis and wound repair.
- Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is an endothelial cell-specific mitogen
  that is essential for endothelial cell survival, proliferation, and migration.
- Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid, shows both anti-inflammatory
  and antioxidant activities in vitro and in vivo.
- This study investigated the molecular mechanism by which DHA down-regulates VEGF-induced
  cell migration.
- HUVECs were used as the study model, and the MTT assay, Western blot, wound-healing
  assay, and phosphatase activity assay were used to explore the effects of DHA on
  cell migration.
- GPR120 is the putative receptor for DHA action.
- The results showed that DHA, PD98059 (an ERK1/2 inhibitor), and GW9508 (a GPR120
  agonist) inhibited VEGF-induced cell migration.
- In contrast, pretreatment with okadaic acid (OA, a PP2A inhibitor) and _S_-nitroso-_N_-acetyl-dl-penicillamine
  (an NO donor) reversed the inhibition of cell migration by DHA.
- VEGF-induced cell migration was accompanied by phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and eNOS.
- Treatment of HUVECs with DHA increased PP2A enzyme activity and decreased VEGF-induced
  phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and eNOS.
- However, pretreatment with OA significantly decreased DHA-induced PP2A enzyme activity
  and reversed the DHA inhibition of VEGF-induced ERK1/2 and eNOS phosphorylation.
- These results suggest that stimulation of PP2A activity and inhibition of the VEGF-induced
  ERK1/2/eNOS signaling pathway may be involved in the DHA suppression of VEGF-induced
  cell migration.
- Thus, the effect of DHA on angiogenesis and wound repair is at least partly by virtue
  of its attenuation of cell migration.
- 'cell migration; docosahexaenoic acid (DHA); human umbilical vein endothelial cells
  (HUVECs); nitric oxide (NO); vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)




  Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6, n-3) is enriched in fatty fish and fish oil supplements
  and is well-known for its anti-inflammatory,(1) immunomodulatory,(2) and anticancer(3)
  properties.'
- Cancer is among the leading causes of death in both economically developed countries
  and developing countries.
- (4) Epidemiological studies show that a diet rich in n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids
  (PUFAs) is correlated with reduced risk of angiogenic diseases such as cancers.
- (5, 6) DHA has been shown to inhibit vascular sprout formation in retinal microvascular
  endothelial cells.
- (7) However, the mechanism underlying the inhibition of cell migration by DHA, which
  is critical for angiogenesis and wound repair, is not fully understood.
- G protein-coupled receptors (GPRs) are important signaling molecules involved in
  many cellular functions.
- Specific ligand binding to GPRs stimulates and induces a variety of cellular responses
  via several second messenger pathways, for example, regulation of cAMP generation,
  the phospholipase C pathway, ion channels, and mitogen-activated protein kinases.
- (8-10) In a previous study, Oh et al.
- (11) found that DHA exerted potent anti-inflammatory effects through GPR120.
- Angiogenesis, the process of the formation of new blood vessels by sprouting of
  the preexisting microvascular network, is involved in numerous physiological processes
  including embryogenesis, tissue remodeling, wound healing,(12) and disease development
  such as diabetic retinopathy, rheumatoid arthritis, tumor growth, and growth of
  atherosclerotic plaques.
- (13) Angiogenesis is controlled by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a
  pro-angiogenic factor.
- (14) VEGF-induced signal transduction involves binding to tyrosine kinase receptors,
  which leads to endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and new vessel formation.
- (15) VEGF was reported to induce a wide variety of signaling pathways, including
  protein kinase C, phospholipase C-γ, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK),
  p38 MAPK, phospholipase C, and phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt.
- (16) Hence, it is critical to understand the VEGF-activated signaling pathways that
  play an important role in VEGF-mediated cell processes.
- Nitric oxide (NO), which is synthesized from the amino acid l-arginine by the NOS
  family of enzymes, is a gaseous molecule with a wide range of physiological and
  pathophysiological activities, including the regulation of angiogenesis.
- '(17) The NOS family is composed of three members: neuronal NOS (nNOS), endothelial
  NOS (eNOS), and inducible NOS (iNOS).'
- eNOS is constitutively expressed in endothelial cells, but various physical and
  chemical stimuli affect eNOS levels in vivo and in vitro.
- (18) Moreover, eNOS is activated upon exposure to fluid shear stress and numerous
  agonists via cellular events such as protein phosphorylation.
- Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a heterotrimeric complex composed of three subunits
  including a structural subunit (PP2A-A), a regulatory subunit (PP2A-B), and a catalytic
  subunit (PP2A-C).
- (19) PP2A is a crucial intracellular serine/threonine phosphatase.
- (20) In addition, PP2A plays a significant role in the regulation of specific signal
  transduction cascades including ERK1/2,(21) JNK,(22) and p38 MAPK.
- (23) In recent years, PP2A was shown to have tumor suppressor activity in myeloid
  CML-BC patient-derived mononuclear marrow cells.
- (24) Thus, enhancement of PP2A tumor suppressor activity may represent a potential
  therapeutic strategy for malignancy.
- The antitumor effect of DHA has been studied in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells
  by induction of heme oxygenase 1 and inhibition of TPA-induced matrix metalloproteinase
  9 (MMP-9) expression.
- (3) Moreover, DHA was reported to have a potent anti-angiogenic effect.
- (25) The pro-angiogenic effect of VEGF and NO has also been demonstrated.
- (15) In this study, therefore, we investigated whether DHA has an opposing effect
  on cell migration that is associated with angiogenesis and wound repair and the
  possible mechanisms involved.
- Medium 199 (M199), Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium, 0.25% trypsin–EDTA, and penicillin–streptomycin–amphotericin
  solution were from GIBCO-BRL (Grand Island, NY, USA); endothelial cell growth supplement
  (ECGS) was from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY, USA); fetal bovine serum

  MI); 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, sodium bicarbonate,
  heparin, gelatin, _S_-nitroso-_N_-acetyl-dl-penicillamine (SNAP, NO donor), LY294002

  inhibitor) was from TOCRIS (Ellisville, MO, USA); and antibodies against ERK1/2,
  phospho-ERK1/2, eNOS, and phospho-eNOS were from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers,
  MA, USA).
- The human umbilical vein endothelial cell line (HUVEC; CC-2517) was obtained from
  Clonetics (San Diego, CA, USA) and was cultured on gelatin-coated cell culture dishes
  in M199 supplemented with 2.2 g/L sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3), 0.1 g/L heparin,
  37.5 mg/L ECGS, 20% FBS, 100,000 units/L penicillin, 0.25 mg/mL amphotericin, and
  100 mg/L streptomycin at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator.
- Cell viability was assessed by the MTT assay.
- The MTT assay measures the ability of viable cells to reduce a yellow 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
  bromide to a purple formazan by mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase.
- HUVECs were grown to 80–90% confluence and then treated with various concentrations
  of DHA (0–200 μM) and GW9508 (1–10 μM) with or without VEGF (50 ng/mL) for 8 h in
  M199 containing 2% FBS.
- Finally, the medium was removed, and the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered
  saline (PBS).
- The cells were then incubated with MTT (0.5 mg/mL) in M199 medium at 37 °C for an
  additional 3 h. The medium was removed, and 2-propanol was added to dissolve the
  formazan.
- After centrifugation at 10000_g_ for 5 min, the supernatant of each sample was transferred
  to 96-well plates, and absorbance was read at 595 nm in an ELISA reader.
- The absorbance in the control group was regarded as 100% cell viability.
- After each experiment, cells were washed twice with PBS and were harvested with
  150 μL of lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1% Triton X-100, 320 mM sucrose,
  5 mM EDTA, 1 mM PMSF, 1 mg/L leupeptin, 1 mg/L aprotinin, and 2 mM DTT).
- Cell homogenates were centrifuged at 14000_g_ for 20 min at 4 °C.
- The resulting supernatant was used as a cellular protein for Western blotting analysis.
- The total protein was analyzed by use of the Coomassie Plus protein assay reagent
  kit (Pierce Biotechnology Inc., Rockford, IL, USA).
- Equal amounts of cellular proteins were electrophoresed in a sodium dodecyl sulfate
  (SDS)–polyacrylamide gel, and proteins were then transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride
  membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA, USA).
- Nonspecific binding sites on the membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in 15
  mM Tris/150 mM NaCl buffer (pH 7.4) at room temperature for 2 h. Membranes were
  probed with anti-ERK1/2, antiphospho-ERK1/2, anti-eNOS, antiphospho-eNOS, and anti-β-actin.
- The membranes were then probed with the secondary antibody labeled with horseradish
  peroxidase.
- The bands were visualized by using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (PerkinElmer
  Life Science, Boston, MA, USA) and were scanned by use of a luminescence image analyzer
  (LAS-4000, FUJIFILM, Japan).
- The bands were quantitated with ImageGauge software (FUJIFILM).
- An in vitro wound-healing assay was used to measure directional endothelial cell
  migration.
- HUVECs were seeded onto gelatin-coated 6-well plates and allowed to form a confluent
  monolayer.
- Monolayers were wounded by using a sterile 200 μL pipet tip, washed with PBS to
  remove floating cells, and photographed (time 0).
- Cells were then cultured in M199 medium containing 2% FBS and 50 ng/mL VEGF.
- Meanwhile, the cells were treated with various concentrations of DHA (0–100 μM)
  with or without SNAP (20 μM) or OA (10 nM) for 8 h. In addition, the cells were
  treated with GW9508 (10 μM) for 8 h. Cells were then photographed (100× magnification)
  to monitor cell migration into the wounded area, and the width of the cell-free
  zone (distance between the edges of the injured monolayer) was calculated.
- PP2A activity was determined by use of a Ser/Thr phosphatase assay kit according
  to the instructions of the manufacturer (Upstate, Darmstadt, Germany).
- After treatment, cells were scraped with lysis buffer (10 mM tris/Triton X-100,
  0.32 M sucrose, 5 mM EDTA) and protease inhibitors, sonicated for 10 s, and centrifuged
  at 2000_g_ for 5 min.
- Thereafter, phosphopeptide (K-R-pT-I-R-R) was added to the cell lysate, followed
  by incubation at room temperature for 15 min, and then Malachite Green phosphate
  was added and the reaction was allowed to proceed at room temperature for another
  15 min for color development.
- The relative absorbance was measured at 650 nm in a microplate reader (Bio-Rad).
- Data were analyzed by using analysis of variance (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).
- The significance of the difference between mean values was determined by one-way
  analysis of variance followed by Tukey’s test.
- _p_ values &lt;0.05 were taken to be statistically significant.
- As measured by the MTT assay, the cell viabilities of HUVECs treated with VEGF alone;
  50, 100, or 200 μM DHA; or VEGF and 50, 100, or 200 μM DHA were 110.5 ± 6.6, 92.9
  ± 1.2, 92.4 ± 2.7, 12.1 ± 2.5, 103.6 ± 7.4, 98.5 ± 7.8, and 11.8 ± 0.8%, respectively,
  compared with the unstimulated controls (100%).
- Thus, there were no adverse effects on the growth of cells up to a concentration
  of 100 μM DHA in the presence or absence of 50 ng/mL VEGF, which was used to induce
  cell migration.
- The highest concentration of DHA used in the present study was 100 μM.
- The cell viabilities of HUVECs treated with VEGF alone, 1 or 10 μM GW9508, or VEGF
  and 1 or 10 μM GW9508 were 116.3 ± 5.8, 97.6 ± 3.5, 99.1 ± 2.5, 107.6 ± 4.5, and
  107.0 ± 7.3%, respectively, compared with the unstimulated controls (100%).
- Thus, there were no adverse effects on the growth of cells up to a concentration
  of 10 μM GW9508 in the presence or absence of 50 ng/mL VEGF.
- Endothelial cell migration is necessary to angiogenesis and wound repair.
- In addition to activation by chemotactic, hepatotactic, and mechanotactic stimuli,
  angiogenesis involves degradation of the extracellular matrix by matrix metalloproteinases
  (MMPs) to enable progression of the migrating cells.
- (26) Moreover, at least 10 MMPs are up-regulated during wound healing by epidermal,
  dermal, fibroblast, and blood cells in mammals.
- (27) To determine the effect of DHA on endothelial cell migration in vitro, confluent
  monolayers of HUVECs were scratched and cultured with M199 medium containing 2%
  FBS plus 50 ng/mL VEGF alone or in addition to 100 μM DHA.
- As shown in Figure 1, VEGF significantly induced cell migration, whereas coculture
  with DHA inhibited the VEGF-induced cell migration (_p_ &lt; 0.05).
- Figure 1.
- DHA inhibits VEGF-induced migration of HUVECs.
- Cells were scratched and then stimulated with 50 ng/mL VEGF in the presence or absence
  of 100 μM DHA for 8 h. Migration was observed by using a phase-contrast microscope,
  at 100× magnification.
- Values are the mean ± SD, _n_ = 3.
- Values not sharing the same letter are significantly different (_p_ &lt; 0.05).
- VEGF has been shown to induce a wide variety of signaling pathways that transduce
  the physiological or pathophysiological activities of VEGF.
- ERK1/2 is one such pathway.
- It has been shown that there is a relationship between ERK1/2 phosphorylation and
  eNOS activation in rat sinusoidal endothelial cells.
- (28) Thus, we determined the effect of VEGF on both ERK1/2 and eNOS phosphorylation.
- As shown in Figure 2A, VEGF stimulated the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and eNOS, and
  this activation was abolished by the ERK1/2 inhibitor PD98059.
- However, VEGF showed no effect on Akt phosphorylation (data not shown).
- VEGF stimulated cell migration, and this effect was dependent on ERK1/2 (Figure
  2B).
- These results suggested that VEGF stimulation of cell migration is mediated by the
  ERK1/2/eNOS pathway.
- Figure 2.
- Phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and eNOS is involved in VEGF-induced migration of HUVECs.
- (A) Cells were starved in M199 containing 2% FBS for 7 h and then pretreated with
  20 μM of the ERK1/2 inhibitor PD98059 for 1 h followed by incubation with 50 ng/mL
  VEGF for another 15 min.
- (B) Cells were scratched and were cotreated with 20 μM PD98059 and 50 ng/mL VEGF
  or treated with 50 ng/mL VEGF for 8 h. Values are the mean ± SD, _n_ = 3.
- Values not sharing the same letter are significantly different (_p_ &lt; 0.05).
- 'Inhibition of VEGF-Induced Cell Migration by DHA Is Associated with the Induction
  of PP2A Enzyme Activity and the Inhibition of ERK1/2 and eNOS Phosphorylation


  Tumor metastasis, the spreading of the primary tumor to distant organs, is recognized
  to be one of the major causes of failure in the treatment of cancer.'
- (29) Thus, intervention in a key step in the metastatic process, such as angiogenesis,
  is an effective mechanism for cancer therapy.
- VEGF plays a critical role in tumor angiogenesis and has been shown to phosphorylate
  eNOS on Ser1177 in glomerular endothelial cells.
- (30) NO produced by activation of eNOS regulates angiogenesis.
- Dephosphorylation of phosphorylated eNOS is mediated by protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A).
- (31) In the present study, the role of DHA in VEGF-induced cell migration was studied
  by using a wound-healing assay.
- As shown in Figure 3A, DHA inhibited VEGF-induced cell migration, and this inhibition
  was abolished by treatment with the PP2A inhibitor, OA.
- These results suggested that DHA inhibition of VEGF-induced cell migration is likely
  associated with activation of PP2A enzyme activity.
- Figure 3.
- Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is involved in DHA inhibition of VEGF-induced phosphorylation
  of ERK1/2 and eNOS and cell migration.
- (A) HUVECs were scratched and pretreated with or without 10 nM of the PP2A inhibitor
  okadaic acid (OA) for 1 h and were then treated with 100 μM DHA along with 50 ng/mL
  VEGF or with 50 ng/mL VEGF for another 8 h. (B) HUVECs were pretreated with or without
  10 nM OA for 1 h and were then treated with 100 μM DHA for another 4 h. (C) HUVECs
  were pretreated with 10 nM OA for 1 h and were then treated with 100 μM DHA for
  8 h before being challenged with 50 ng/mL VEGF for another 15 min.
- Values are the mean ± SD, _n_ = 3.
- Values not sharing the same letter are significantly different (_p_ &lt; 0.05).
- Recently, it was shown that PP2A has tumor suppressor activity in myeloid CML-BC
  patient-derived mononuclear marrow cells.
- (24) We used the Ser/Thr phosphatase assay to measure PP2A enzyme activity.
- As shown in Figure 3B, DHA significantly stimulated PP2A enzyme activity compared
  with that in the control group, and this activation was attenuated by treatment
  with OA.
- We next examined whether OA reversed the DHA inhibition of VEGF-induced ERK1/2 and
  eNOS phosphorylation.
- As shown in Figure 3C, VEGF induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and eNOS, and pretreatment
  with DHA attenuated this induction.
- Nevertheless, pretreatment with OA reversed the inhibition of eNOS phosphorylation
  by DHA.
- OA also reversed the attenuation of VEGF-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation by DHA,
  although this effect was not significant.
- 'Effect of GPR120 Agonist on VEGF-Induced Phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and eNOS as
  well as Cell Migration


  GPR120 is a physiological receptor for long-chain fatty acids, in particular n-3
  fatty acids, such as α-linolenic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and DHA.'
- (11, 32) To determine the role of GPR120 in DHA’s inhibition of cell migration,
  we used the GPR120 agonist GW9508.
- As shown in Figure 4A, GW9508 had an effect similar to that of DHA on the VEGF-induced
  phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and eNOS.
- Moreover, the inhibitory effect of DHA on VEGF-induced cell migration was replicated
  by GW9508 (Figure 4B).
- These results suggested that the effects of DHA were highly associated with binding
  to GPR120.
- Figure 4.
- Effect of GPR120 agonist on phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and eNOS and cell migration
  induced by VEGF in HUVECs.
- (A) Cells were pretreated with 100 μM DHA or 10 μM GW9508 for 8 h followed by incubation
  with 50 ng/mL VEGF for another 15 min.
- (B) Cells were scratched and were cotreated with 100 μM DHA or 10 μM GW9508 along
  with 50 ng/mL VEGF for 8 h. Values are the mean ± SD, _n_ = 3.
- Values not sharing the same letter are significantly different (_p_ &lt; 0.05).
- VEGF activates eNOS and stimulates the release of NO from HUVECs.
- (33) Endothelium-derived NO is critical regulator of endothelial cell migration,
  survival, and angiogenesis.
- (34) To determine the effect of the NO donor SNAP on endothelial cell migration
  in vitro, confluent monolayers of HUVECs were scratched and cultured in M199 medium
  containing 2% FBS plus vehicle, 50 ng/mL VEGF, 100 μM DHA and 50 ng/mL VEGF, or
  100 μM DHA, 20 μM SNAP, and 50 ng/mL VEGF, respectively.
- As shown in Figure 5, SNAP reversed DHA inhibition of VEGF-induced cell migration.
- Figure 5.
- SNAP reverses DHA inhibition of VEGF-induced migration in HUVECs.
- Cells were scratched and were treated with 50 ng/mL VEGF alone, cotreated with 100
  μM DHA and 50 ng/mL VEGF, or cotreated with 20 μM SNAP, 100 μM DHA, and 50 ng/mL
  VEGF for 8 h. Values are the mean ± SD, _n_ = 3.
- Values not sharing the same letter are significantly different (_p_ &lt; 0.05).
- Cancer has attracted considerable attention in the past decades because it is among
  the leading causes of death globally.
- (4) Protection against cancer by DHA is attributed to the anti-angiogenic activity
  of DHA.
- (35) However, the mechanisms by which DHA inhibits angiogenesis are still not fully
  clarified.
- In this study, we explored the inhibition of HUVEC cell migration by DHA and the
  possible mechanisms involved.
- We demonstrated that DHA inhibits VEGF-induced HUVEC cell migration and that this
  suppression is likely associated with binding to GPR120, activation of PP2A enzyme
  activity, and inhibition of the ERK1/2/eNOS signaling pathway.
- Several mechanisms have been proposed to demonstrate the inhibitory role of DHA
  in angiogenesis, including induction of apoptosis and reduction of cell proliferation.
- (36-38) Rose and Connolly(36) proposed that the inhibition of breast cancer cell
  proliferation by DHA was related to the reduced production of series 2 eicosanoids.
- Although DHA may prevent the occurrence of angiogenic diseases, it has potential
  side effects on subjects receiving revascularization therapy because of its inhibition
  of cell migration.
- (39) In recent years, EPA and DHA have been shown to inhibit angiogenesis, possibly
  by regulating the production or activation of various pro-angiogenic factors such
  as eNOS, VEGF, cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2)-derived prostanoids, and MMP-9.
- (7, 40, 41) Moreover, EPA and DHA dose-dependently inhibit ERK1/2 phosphorylation,
  and this is likely associated with reduced PGE2 and VEGF production by EPA and DHA
  in HT-29 human colorectal cells.
- '(40)


  VEGF has been shown to induce eNOS phosphorylation and cell migration in HUVECs,
  and this activation is abolished by DHA.'
- (42) Moreover, DHA has been demonstrated to inhibit TPA-induced MMP-9 expression
  and cell migration and invasion in MCF-7 breast cancer cells.
- (3) Consistent with the results of these previous studies, our data showed that
  DHA exerted an inhibitory effect on VEGF-induced cell migration in HUVECs (Figure
  1).
- Cell migration is essential for angiogenesis.
- Thus, the results of the present study suggest that DHA is a potential anti-angiogenic
  agent.
- ERK1/2 is known to play an important role in cell proliferation, and protein phosphatases
  are generally identified as inhibitors of cell proliferation via dephosphorylation
  of ERK1/2.
- (21) Activation of the Akt/eNOS(43) or ERK1/2/eNOS(30) pathways is reported to be
  involved in VEGF-induced NO release.
- In the present study, VEGF activated phosphorylation of ERK1/2 but not of Akt (data
  not shown).
- Pretreatment with the ERK1/2 inhibitor PD98059 abolished VEGF-induced phosphorylation
  of ERK1/2 and eNOS in HUVECs (Figure 2A).
- These results suggest that eNOS is the downstream target of ERK1/2.
- Moreover, DHA was shown to inhibit VEGF-induced cell migration via suppression of
  the ERK1/2/eNOS signaling pathway (Figure 3A,C).
- Similar to DHA treatment, the ERK1/2 inhibitor PD98059 abolished cell migration
  (Figure 2B).
- Furthermore, as shown in Figure 5, SNAP reversed the DHA inhibition of VEGF-induced
  cell migration.
- These results strongly suggest that the DHA inhibition of VEGF-induced cell migration
  is through the ERK1/2/eNOS-mediated signaling pathway.
- Reversible protein phosphorylation plays an important role in many cellular processes.
- (20) In general, cells use protein phosphorylation to alter enzyme properties such
  as activity and cell distribution of key regulatory proteins involved in specific
  pathways.
- Through the use of specific PP2A inhibitors and gene silencing technique, PP2A has
  been shown to play a key role in the regulation of cell cycle, cell morphology,
  and development.
- In addition, PP2A was demonstrated to be a tumor suppressor and can be a target
  for cancer therapy.
- (44) For example, it is reported that conjugated linoleic acid inhibits the proliferation
  of MCF-7 human breast cancer cells and that the working mechanisms include activation
  of PP2A and inhibition of ERK1/2 activation.
- (21) Pretreatment with the PP2A inhibitor OA reverses the effect of conjugated linoleic
  acid on both increased PP2A expression level and dephosphorylation of ERK1/2.
- This result strongly suggests that dephosphorylation of ERK1/2 is mediated by PP2A.
- Phosphorylated eNOS is also a substrate of PP2A.
- (31) It is reported that endostatin inhibits endothelial cell migration and angiogenesis
  by down-regulating the phosphorylation of eNOS at Ser1177 via PP2A, which results
  in a decrease in NO synthesis.
- (45, 46) In the present study, we demonstrated that DHA activated PP2A enzyme activity,
  which was inhibited by OA pretreatment (Figure 3B).
- Pretreatment with OA reversed the inhibitory effect of DHA on VEGF-induced cell
  migration and phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and eNOS (Figure 3A,C).
- These results indicate that PP2A participates in the DHA inhibition of VEGF-induced
  ERK1/2/eNOS phosphorylation and cell migration.
- Activation of PP2A by DHA is by an as yet unidentified signaling pathway.
- DHA exerts anti-inflammatory effects, but the mechanisms of these effects are not
  fully understood.
- It has been shown that GPR120 functions as an n-3 PUFA receptor.
- (11) In an in vitro study using RAW 264.7 cells and primary intraperitoneal macrophages,
  stimulation of GPR120 with n-3 PUFAs or the chemical agonist GW9508 causes a wide
  range of anti-inflammatory effects.
- All of these effects are abolished by GPR120 knockdown.
- Therefore, we hypothesize that DHA inhibits VEGF-induced cell migration through
  binding with GPR120.
- We used the GPR120 agonist GW9508 to simulate the activation of GPR120 by DHA in
  the suppression of VEGF-induced cell migration.
- The results showed that GW9508 significantly inhibited VEGF-induced cell migration,
  and the inhibitory effect was similar to that of DHA (Figure 4B).
- In addition, GW9508 significantly suppressed VEGF-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2
  and eNOS (Figure 4A), which is critical to cell migration.
- Our findings in the present study are presented schematically in Figure 6.
- In conclusion, DHA significantly inhibits VEGF-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2
  and eNOS and cell migration via binding to GPR120 and induction of PP2A enzyme activity
  in HUVECs.
- Treatment with the NO donor SNAP reverses the DHA inhibition of VEGF-induced cell
  migration.
- Taken together, these results support an opposing role of DHA in cell migration,
  which is implicated in its anticancer and anti-wound-repair properties.
- Figure 6.
- Model showing the pathways that mediate DHA inhibition of VEGF-induced cell migration
