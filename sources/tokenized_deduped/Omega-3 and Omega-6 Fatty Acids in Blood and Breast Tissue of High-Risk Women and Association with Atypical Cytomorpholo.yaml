- The ratio of omega-3 to omega-6 fatty acids, especially the long-chain eicosapentaenoic
  acid (EPA) + docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) to arachidonic acid (AA) ratio, is inversely
  associated with breast cancer risk.
- We measured the association between cytologic atypia, a biomarker for short-term
  risk of breast cancer development, and omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acid intake and
  levels in blood and breast tissue.
- Blood and benign breast tissue, sampled by random periareolar fine-needle aspiration
  (RPFNA), was obtained from 70 women at elevated risk for breast cancer.
- Self-reported dietary intake was assessed by the NCI's Food Frequency Questionnaire.
- The fatty acid composition of five lipid compartments, red blood cell, plasma and
  breast phospholipids, and plasma and breast triaclyglycerides (TAG), was analyzed
  by gas chromatography as weight percent.
- Median daily intakes of EPA+DHA and total omega-3 fatty acids were 80 mg and 1.1
  g, respectively.
- The median total omega-3:6 intake ratio was 1:10.
- Compared with women without atypia, those with cytologic atypia had lower total
  omega-3 fatty acids in red blood cell and plasma phospholipids and lower omega-3:6
  ratios in plasma TAGs and breast TAGs (_P_ &lt; 0.05).
- The EPA+DHA:AA ratio in plasma TAGs was also lower among women with atypia.
- This is the first report of associations between tissue levels of omega-3 and omega-6
  fatty acids and a reversible tissue biomarker of breast cancer risk.
- RPFNA cytomorphology could serve as a surrogate endpoint for breast cancer prevention
  trials of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation.
