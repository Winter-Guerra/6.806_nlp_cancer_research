- This work analyses the mutagenicity of seawater from mussel farms using the _Vibrio
  harveyi_ mutagenicity test and its relationship with the accumulated pollutants
  and the development of gonadal neoplasia in mussels.
- Histological disorders identified as germinoma were observed in the gonad of _Mytilus
  galloprovincialis_ during the period of study.
- The prevalence of this pathology is significantly correlated with certain levels
  of pollutants accumulated in mussels, mainly of PAHs and PCBs, whose toxic equivalents
  were calculated as EROD induction equivalency.
- The mutagenicity and toxicity of the water surrounding mussel's farms is clearly
  correlated with the pollutants accumulated and with the neoplasia prevalence in
  mussels.
- Such correlations are corroborated by a multivariate analysis.
- Our results conclude with the utility of _V.
- harveyi_ test as an optimal and rapid method in the monitoring of the quality of
  the water from mussel farms and as a tool to control the risks of pollution on mussel
  production and its safety for human food.
