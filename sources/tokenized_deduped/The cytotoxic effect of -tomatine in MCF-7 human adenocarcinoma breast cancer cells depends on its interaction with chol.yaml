- In recent years, α-tomatine has been studied for its anticancer activity.
- In the present study, we focused on the cytotoxic effect of α-tomatine in the MCF-7
  human breast adenocarcinoma cell line, its mechanism of action, biotransformation
  and stability in the culture medium.
- We observed an inhibition of cell proliferation and viability at concentrations
  of 6 and 9 µM but then a recovery of cells occurred.
- The recovery was not caused by the biotransformation of α-tomatine in MCF-7 cells,
  but by a substantial decrease in the concentration of α-tomatine in the culture
  medium due to its binding with cholesterol.
- Regarding the mechanism of action of α-tomatine, we observed no DNA damage, no changes
  in the levels of the proteins p53 and p21WAF1/Cip1, and no apoptosis (neither activated
  caspase-8 and -9, nor sub-G1 peak, or morphological signs).
- We found a loss of ATP in α-tomatine-treated cells.
- These results support the conclusion that α-tomatine does not induce apoptosis in
  the MCF-7 cell line.
- α-Tomatine is a natural steroidal glycoalkaloid, occurring mainly in stems, leaves
  and roots of tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicon L.) and other Solanum species.
- Its content is high in immature green tomatoes and decreases during ripening.
- α-Tomatine is composed of the 6-ring steroidal aglycone tomatidine by which a tetrasaccharide
  moiety (containing xylose, galactose and 2 glucose units) is bound to the 3-OH group
  of the aglycone.
- Its partial hydrolysis leads to the loss of different sugar parts of α-tomatine
  and to the formation of β1-(β2-) tomatine (containing a trisaccharide moiety), γ-tomatine
  (with a disaccharide) and δ-tomatine (with a monosaccharide) (1,2).
- α-Tomatine is a biologically active compound that possesses numerous health-related
  properties.
- It exhibits antiviral, antibiotic and anti-inflammatory activity (3–5), stimulates
  antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune response (6), inhibits acetylcholinesterase
  activity (7) and has cardiotonic effects (8).
- Its other effects are connected to its ability to form an insoluble complex with
  cholesterol in a 1:1 molar ratio (2,9).
- Since such complex with dietary cholesterol is not able to pass through the intestinal
  wall, the p.o.
- administration of α-tomatine decreases the plasma cholesterol level (10).
- Moreover, α-tomatine disrupts cholesterol containing mammalian biomembranes which
  could lead to various symptoms of intoxication (gastrointestinal disturbances, haemolysis)
  (11).
- In recent years, the anticancer effect of α-tomatine and its mechanism of action
  have been studied.
- In tumor-bearing mice, α-tomatine inhibited tumor growth at doses of approximately
  1 mg/kg (12–14).
- In vitro, α-tomatine inhibits the growth of human colon HT29 and liver HepG2 cancer
  cell lines more than classical anticancer agents (doxorubicin, camptothecin) (15).
- Furthermore, it is cytotoxic to different human lung cancer cells (A549, NCI-H460)
  (16,17), human prostatic adenocarcinoma PC3 cells (18), mouse EL4 lymphoma cells
  (19), several leukemia cell lines (14,20) and breast adenocarcinoma MCF-7 cells
  (21).
- Previous studies demonstrated the caspase-independent cell death in α-tomatine-treated
  human leukemic cell lines (14,20).
- In the PC-3 cell line, α-tomatine induced apoptosis (18).
- Furthermore, it inhibited the migration and invasion of cancer cells by inactivating
  FAK/PI3K/Akt and Erk signaling pathways with a decrease in the binding activity
  of NF-κB (16,17,21).
- In the present study, we examined the dose- and time-dependent inhibition of the
  growth of the human breast adenocarcinoma MCF-7 cell line after α-tomatine treatment.
- Due to conflicting reports in the literature regarding the induction of apoptosis
  by α-tomatine, we also focused on the mechanism of action and DNA damage in MCF-7
  cells.
- The stability of α-tomatine in culture medium and its biotransformation were also
  studied.
- Human breast adenocarcinoma cell line MCF-7 was obtained from the American Type
  Culture Collection (ATCC; Manassas, VA, USA) and maintained in Dulbecco’s Modified
  Eagle’s Medium (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) supplemented with a 10% fetal
  calf serum, L-glutamine, penicillin, streptomycin and non-essential amino acids.
- Cell cultures were maintained at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and the
  culture medium was renewed every 2–3 days.
- Cells were detached by incubation with trypsin.
- Cell lines in a maximal range of up to 20 passages were used for this study.
- Appropriate amounts of stock solution of α-tomatine (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.,
  Santa Cruz, CA, USA) dissolved in DMSO were added to the culture medium to achieve
  the final concentration of 1–9 μM.
- The control group was treated with DMSO at the concentration of 0.6% in every assay.
- For irradiation treatment, the cells were irradiated in culture flasks at room temperature
  using a 60Co γ-ray source (Chisotron, Chirana, Ostrava, Czech Republic) at a distance
  of 1 m from the source, at the photon dose rate of 1 Gy/min.
- For assessing the cytotoxic effect of α-tomatine on cell viability, WST-1 (Roche,
  Basel, Switzerland) reagent was used.
- MCF-7 cells were seeded in 96-well microtiter plates at a concentration of 5×103
  cells/well in 200 μl of culture medium.
- The cells were allowed to settle overnight at 37°C and in 5% CO2.
- Next, cultures were exposed to different concentrations (1, 3, 6, 9 μM) of α-tomatine
  for differing time intervals.
- At the end of each interval, cells were rinsed with PBS and 100 μl of WST-1 was
  added.
- Absorbance was measured after 2 h of incubation with WST-1 at 450 nm and a reference
  wavelength of 650 nm in a Tecan SpectraFluor Plus spectrometer (Tecan Austria GmbH,
  Grödig, Austria).
- MCF-7 cells were seeded into plastic tissue-culture dishes with glass bottoms and
  left for 24 h in an incubator with 5% CO2 at 37°C.
- The next day, the growth medium was replaced with a medium containing different
  concentrations of α-tomatine (3 and 9 μM).
- The tissue-culture dishes were transferred into a time-lapse imaging system BioStation
  IM (Nikon, Prague, Czech Republic) combining an incubator, a motorized microscope
  and a cooled CCD camera.
- Recording was carried out in a multipoint and multichannel manner employing various
  time-lapse modes and upon small as well as high magnifications to allow global as
  well as detailed view of changes in the behavior of the treated cell populations.
- Recorded sequences were subsequently semi-automatically analyzed with the software
  NIS-Elements AR 3.20 (Nikon).
- Growth of MCF-7 cells was continuously monitored for at least 90 h using the xCELLigence
  RTCA MP instrument (Roche).
- The background impedance signal was measured with 50 μl of cell culture medium/well.
- The final volume in a single well was adjusted to 100 μl of cell culture medium
  by adding an additional 50 μl of medium containing MCF-7 cells.
- The impedance was recorded in 15 min intervals.
- Twenty-four hours after seeding, α-tomatine was added to the culture.
- All incubations were performed at a volume of 150 μl.
- α-Tomatine was analyzed at 4 different concentrations (1, 3, 6 and 9 μM), each one
  with 4 replicates.
- 'The impedance signal was analyzed by normalizing data of each single well to the
  first measurement after starting the treatment: CI(normalized) = CItime x/CInorm
  time (termed here ‘normalized cell index’).'
- This normalized cell index was used for representing the results graphically and
  exported for further processing using Microsoft Office Excel (Microsoft Inc., Redmond,
  WA, USA).
- ATP content in MCF-7 cells exposed to α-tomatine at 4 different concentrations (1,
  3, 6 and 9 μM) was measured by an ATP bioluminescent assay kit (Sigma-Aldrich).
- ATP content was calculated from a standard curve derived from known concentrations
  of ATP and was expressed as a percentage of the control.
- LDH activity was determined at individual time points in the medium of α-tomatine
  exposed MCF-7 cells.
- An aliquot (0.1 ml) of each sample was added to a cuvette with 0.2 ml of 2.5 mg/ml
  NADH solution and 0.2 ml of sodium pyruvate solution (1 mg/ml).
- The total LDH activity was determined after sonication of cells.
- The enzyme activity was determined spectrophotometrically and the rate of enzyme
  leakage/min was expressed as percentage of the total LDH activity compared to untreated
  control cells.
- This method is used to assess the single-strand breaks (SSBs) and double-strand
  breaks (DSBs) present in the DNA.
- The alkaline and neutral version of the comet assay was used as previously described
  (22,23).
- Cells were embedded in 1% agarose (Sigma-Aldrich) on microscope slides and lysed
  in 10 mM of Tris-buffered 2.5 M NaCl (pH 10.0; Penta, Prague, Czech Republic) with
  1% Triton X-100 (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany), and 100 mM EDTA (Penta) at 4°C
  for 1 h. The alkaline comet assay (NaOH, EDTA) was carried out at 40 V, 300 mA,
  for 30 min at 4°C after 40 min of alkaline unwinding.
- The neutral comet assay (90 mM Tris, 90 mM boric acid, 2 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) was performed
  at 29 V, 6 mA, for 40 min, at 4°C.
- Comets were scored by the Lucia 6.20 image analysis comet module (Laboratory Imaging,
  Prague, Czech Republic) after staining of cells with ethidium bromide (Sigma-Aldrich).
- The percentage of DNA in the comet tail was assessed in at least 50 cells/slide
  and the median DNA damage score for each gel was calculated.
- Generally, 4–6 gels for each treatment group were scored, and the means ± SD (standard
  deviation) of medians of these gels are presented.
- The cells treated with α-tomatine were harvested for the preparation of whole-cell
  lysates (Cell Lysis Buffer; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Boston, MA, USA) and
  the protein content was quantified using BCA assay (Sigma-Aldrich).
- Lysates with an equal amount of protein (10 μg) were loaded on 12% SDS-PAGE gels.
- After electrophoresis, the separated proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane
  (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).
- The membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween-20 and
  10% non-fat dry milk and incubated with primary antibody (p53; Exbio, Prague, Czech
  Republic; p53_serine15; Calbiochem-Merck Co., USA; Chk1, Chk1_serine345; Chk2, Chk2_threonine68;
  Cell Signaling Technology; β-actin, p21WAF1/Cip1; Sigma-Aldrich) at 4°C overnight.
- Then, the membranes were incubated with polyclonal anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary
  antibody (DakoCytomation, Glostrup, Denmark).
- For band detection, a chemiluminescence detection kit (Roche) was used.
- In order to detect caspase-8 and -9 activity, Caspase-Glo® Assays (Promega Corporations,
  Madison, WI, USA) were used according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
- Briefly, the cells (1×104) treated with the different concentrations of α-tomatine
  were seeded per well using a 96-well plate format (Sigma-Aldrich) and incubated
  with 50 μl of Caspase-Glo® Assays reagent for 30 min before the luminescence was
  measured using a Tecan Infinite M200 spectrometer (Tecan Group, Männedorf, Switzerland).
- After 24 and 72 h of incubation with α-tomatine, cells were harvested, washed twice
  with ice-cold PBS buffer, fixed and permeabilized with 70% ethanol.
- For detecting low-molecular-weight fragments of DNA, the cells were incubated for
  5 min at room temperature in a buffer (192 ml 0.2 M Na2HPO4 \+ 8 ml 0.1 M citric
  acid, pH 7.8) and then stained with propidium iodide in Vindelov’s solution for
  60 min at 37°C (all reagents from Sigma-Aldrich).
- The DNA content was determined by flow cytometer Dako CyAn (Beckman Coulter, Brea,
  CA, USA) with an excitation wave length of 488 nm; the total emission above 560
  nm was recorded.
- List mode data were analyzed using Multicycle AV software (Phoenix Flow Systems,
  San Diego, CA, USA) and the percentage of cycling cells was determined.
- MCF-7 cells were treated with 6 μM of α-tomatine for 4 h. The cells were fixed in
  2% paraformaldehyde and 1% glutaraldehyde in phosphate buffer for 4 h at 4°C.
- The cells were then post-fixed in 2% OsO4 in phosphate buffer for 2 h at room temperature.
- The dehydration was carried out in graded ethanol and propylene glycol and embedding
  in Epon-Durcupan (Sigma-Aldrich).
- Ultra-thin sections (60 nm) were prepared and placed on grids, stained with 2% uranyl
  acetate solution and 0.2% lead citrate in 0.1 M NaOH, and examined in a Tesla BS-500
  transmission electron microscope (Tesla, Brno, Czech Republic).
- The calibration of magnification was carried out using the calibrator 02902-AB (SPI,
  West Chester, PA, USA).
- Separation was performed on a 1200 series liquid chromatography system (Agilent
  Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA) consisting of degasser, quaternary pump, autosampler
  and thermostated column compartment.
- The HPLC column used was Accucore C18 (100×2.1 mm, 2.6 μm) (Thermo Scientific, San
  Jose, CA, USA) held at 40°C.
- The mobile phase flowing at a rate of 0.6 ml/min consisted of ammonium formate (5
  mM, pH=3.8) (solvent A) and acetonitrile (solvent B).
- 'The gradient elution program was: from 20 to 27% (v/v) of solvent B in 4.5 min,
  for 1 min at 50% solvent B and equilibration at 20% (v/v) of solvent B for 2 min.'
- Column output was coupled with a 3D ion trap LCQ Fleet mass spectrometer with electrospray
  interface (Thermo Scientific).
- 'All mass scans were operated in positive SIM mode at m/z 1033.5–1035.5 for α-tomatine
  and 883.5–885.5 for solasonine (IS) (Research Plus Inc., Bayonne, NJ, USA) with
  the following optimized settings for the ion source: spray voltage 4 kV, sheath
  gas 40 AU, auxiliary gas 10 AU, capillary voltage 20 V, capillary temperature 260°C,
  tube lens voltage 92 V.




  For metabolite screening, the same chromatographic system and mass spectrometer
  was used as in the case of α-tomatine analysis.'
- Chromatography was carried out on HPLC column Kinetex C18 (150×3 mm, 2.6 μm) (Phenomenex,
  Torrance, CA, USA) held at 45°C.
- The mobile phase flowing at a rate of 0.6 ml/min consisted of ammonium formate (5
  mM, pH=3.8) (solvent A) and acetonitrile (solvent B).
- 'The gradient elution program was: from 20 to 60% (v/v) of solvent B in 30 min,
  equilibration at 20% (v/v) of solvent B for 5 min.'
- Mass spectrometric conditions were the same as in the analysis of α-tomatine, data
  were scanned in full scan mode (150–2,000 m/z).
- Putative α-tomatine metabolites arising from deglycosidation were prepared by acid
  hydrolysis of α-tomatine standard.
- The hydrolysis proceeded in a solution of 0.25 M hydrochloric acid prepared in methanol.
- α-Tomatine was dissolved at a final concentration of 10 μM in the above-mentioned
  solution and left 1 h at 60°C.
- After hydrolysis, 5 μl was injected directly onto the column.
- Ten microliters of the internal standard (solasonine, 50 μM) and 100 μl of acetonitrile
  were added to a 100 μl sample aliquot.
- The sample was vortex mixed, centrifuged (12,700 × g, 10 min, 4°C) and the supernatant
  transferred to a vial with a glass insert.
- Five microliters of the sample were injected onto the column.
- Frozen samples (−80°C) of incubation media and MCF-7 cell pellet reconstituted in
  100 μl of water were thawed at room temperature.
- Two hundred microliters of 10% (v/v) formic acid in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF)
  were added to a 100 μl sample aliquot.
- The sample was vortex mixed, centrifuged (12,700 × g, 10 min, 4°C) and transferred
  to a vial with a glass insert.
- Five microliters of the sample were injected onto the column.
- The 10% (v/v) formic acid in DMF was able to solubilize serum proteins, including
  albumin and to dissociate the cholesterol/α-tomatine complex.
- In contrast to the precipitation with acetonitrile, the putative metabolites could
  neither be retained by protein precipitate nor in complexes with cholesterol when
  10% (v/v) formic acid in DMF was used for the sample treatment.
- The statistical data for caspase-8 and -9 assays, flow cytometry and comet assay
  were evaluated with descriptive statistics using Microsoft Office Excel (Microsoft
  Inc.).
- Data are expressed as an arithmetic means ± SD of at least 3 independent experiments
  and statistical analysis was performed using a Student’s t-test.
- Significant differences were established at p≤0.001.
- The statistical data for WST-1, xCELLigence, ATP and LDH assays were evaluated with
  GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software version 4.0, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) software.
- Data are expressed as an arithmetic means ± SD of at least 3 independent experiments
  and statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA test and Dunnett’s post-hoc
  test for multiple comparisons.
- Significant differences were established at p≤0.05.
- We studied the effect of α-tomatine at various concentrations (0, 1, 3, 6 and 9
  μM) on cell viability and proliferation of the MCF-7 cell line at different times
  of exposure (24, 48 and 72 h).
- A WST-1 assay was used for viability measurement and an xCELLigence system was used
  to measure proliferation.
- As shown in Fig.
- 1A, α-tomatine exerted a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on the viability of MCF-7
  cells.
- Treatment with α-tomatine at concentrations of 1 and 3 μM did not significantly
  alter the viability of the MCF-7 cell line (compared with the untreated control)
  after 24, 48 and 72 h. Treatment with 6 and 9 μM caused a significant decrease in
  the cell viability after 24, 48 and 72 h. Similarly, the proliferation of MCF-7
  cells after α-tomatine treatment decreased in a dose-dependent manner and the EC50
  value after 72 h was 7.17 μM as determined by the xCELLigence system (Fig.
- 1B).
- The inhibition of proliferation and viability of MCF-7 cells was the most pronounced
  after 24 h of α-tomatine action.
- Furthermore, we studied the cytotoxic effect on MCF-7 cells using the measurement
  of LDH release from damaged cells.
- Again, the concentrations of 6 μM (after 4–72 h) and 9 μM (after 2–72 h) of α-tomatine
  caused significant damage (Fig.
- 1C) to treated cells, with the highest effect occurring after 24 h. The release
  of LDH is a result of membrane destabilization.
- The inhibition of proliferation corresponds with the finding of check-point kinase
  1 (Chk1) activation.
- In MCF-7 cells treated with α-tomatine at concentrations of 1, 3 and 6 μM after
  4 h, the amount of Chk1 increased.
- This increase was accompanied by phosphorylation of Chk1 on serine 345 after the
  same incubation time (Fig.
- 1D).
- After 24 h, the changes in Chk1 and its phosphorylated form disappeared (data not
  shown).
- The morphology and behavior of MCF-7 cells after treatment with 3 and 9 μM of α-tomatine
  were recorded over a 72-h period using time-lapse videomicroscopy.
- Control cultures showed a time-dependent increase in the number of cells culminating
  at 72 h, when full confluence was reached.
- Similar timing and dynamics were also observed upon 3 μM of α-tomatine treatment
  with no morphological or behavioral alterations.
- Conversely, 9 μM of α-tomatine significantly reduced proliferation of MCF-7 cells
  over a 24-h period.
- Cells did not divide, their membranes demonstrated reduced undulations and many
  detached from the substratum and rapidly collapsed, releasing their content into
  the medium.
- On the other hand, no specific apoptotic morphologies (i.e.
- blebbing) were observed.
- In subsequent time intervals (24–72 h of treatment), a number of thus affected cells
  decreased and the remaining cells started to behave actively including mitoses.
- At the end of the experiment (72 h), the treated culture clearly recovered and continued
  in proliferation (Fig.
- 1E).
- These results indicated the significant cytotoxic effects of α-tomatine at concentrations
  of 6 and 9 μM after 4, 6, 12 and 24 h of treatment.
- After 48 and 72 h of treatment, the cytotoxic effects persisted, but the cells started
  to proliferate again and their viability increased.
- Since DNA is the main target of most cytotoxic anticancer drugs, we focused on the
  induction of DNA damage in MCF-7 cells after α-tomatine treatment.
- To assess DNA damage in MCF-7 cells, we used the alkaline and neutral version of
  the comet assay.
- The alkaline version is employed for the quantification of SSBs of DNA.
- The concentrations of α-tomatine used (1–9 μM) did not cause any significant SSBs
  after 4 h compared with H2O2-treated MCF-7 cells (Fig.
- 2A–C and G).
- The neutral version specifically determines DSBs of DNA.
- The same concentrations of α-tomatine, as they were used in the alkaline version
  of the comet assay, did not cause any significant DSBs after 4 h of treatment in
  comparison with irradiated cells (20 Gy after 0.5 h).
- These results indicated that α-tomatine caused no DNA damage in MCF-7 cells (Fig.
- 2D–F and H).
- In the next step, we confirmed no DSBs of DNA by determining check-point kinase
  2 (Chk2) non-activation.
- After 4 h of α-tomatine treatment (1, 3 and 6 μM), no phosphorylation on threonine
  68 of Chk2 occurred in comparison with the positive control group (10 Gy irradiation
  after 24 h) (Fig.
- 2I).
- Although our results indicate no α-tomatine-induced DNA damage in MCF-7 cells, we
  elucidated whether apoptosis is induced in the cells exposed to α-tomatine by another
  triggering mechanism.
- Initially, we evaluated changes in the levels of proteins p53, p53 phosphorylated
  on serine 15 and p21WAF1/CIP1 in α-tomatine-treated (1, 3 and 6 μM) MCF-7 cells
  after 4 and 24 h of incubation.
- No changes in the levels of these proteins were observed (Fig.
- 3A).
- Then, we measured the caspase-8 and -9 activity after 24 and 72 h of incubation
  with α-tomatine (1, 3 and 6 μM).
- No significant increase in the activity of these caspases was observed after α-tomatine
  treatment (Fig.
- 3B).
- We used cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry to assess possible apoptosis after
  α-tomatine treatment (1, 3 and 6 μM) for 24 and 72 h. As shown in Fig.
- 3C, the concentrations of α-tomatine used caused no specific apoptotic sub-G1 peak
  after 24 and 72 h of treatment.
- To confirm our theory that α-tomatine did not cause apoptosis in MCF-7 cells, we
  measured the loss of ATP in α-tomatine-treated cells (3, 6 and 9 μM) after 2, 4,
  6, 12, 24, 48 and 72 h. Fig.
- 3D demonstrates a significant decrease, in comparison to untreated cells, in the
  content of ATP in cells treated with 9 μM of α-tomatine at all treatment intervals
  between 4 and 72 h and with 6 μM of α-tomatine at all treatment intervals between
  6 and 72 h. Moreover, to gain further insight into the mechanism of cell death caused
  by α-tomatine, transmission electron microscopy of MCF-7 cells treated with 6 μM
  of α-tomatine was carried out (Fig.
- 4).
- The treated cells showed swelling and disintegration of both nuclear and plasma
  membranes, characteristic of a rapid necrosis, but no typical morphologic signs
  of apoptosis, such as cell shrinkage, nuclear fragmentation, chromatin condensation,
  nuclear and cytoplasmic blebbing and the formation of apoptotic bodies.
- Previous results indicated that α-tomatine at concentrations of 6 and 9 μM caused
  a cytotoxic effect in MCF-7 cells during the first 24 h, but after 48 and 72 h of
  incubation cell proliferation and viability began to increase.
- Thus, we monitored the concentration of α-tomatine in the medium during the incubation
  with cells in order to determine whether it changes with time.
- 'We detected a decrease in the level of α-tomatine from the initial value of 2.49
  to 1.56 μM after 4 h, to 0.90 μM after 24 h, to 0.73 μM after 48 h, and to 0.75
  μM after 72 h.


  As cholesterol is known to form an insoluble precipitate with α-tomatine, its effect
  in the incubation media was evaluated.'
- Initially, the stability of 3 μM of α-tomatine in PBS buffer (pH 7.4) during the
  72 h of incubation was confirmed (Fig.
- 5A).
- Subsequently, the effect of cholesterol was tested.
- Since cholesterol is insoluble in aqueous solutions, albumin was used as a carrier.
- When fetal calf serum was replaced by pure albumin in the standard incubation medium,
  a decrease in α-tomatine in the cell-free medium was not observed during the incubation
  time.
- By contrast, &gt;50% of α-tomatine was lost during the first 4 h of incubation when
  albumin containing the same concentration of cholesterol as the fetal calf serum
  (100 μM) was used.
- Therefore, interaction of α-tomatine with cholesterol appears to be the main reason
  for the decrease in α-tomatine in the medium during incubation, at least in the
  absence of cells.
- To support this hypothesis, we also carried out tests to exclude the possible metabolism
  of α-tomatine caused by MCF-7 cells or enzymes present in the fetal calf serum added
  to an incubation medium.
- The incubation of 3 μM of α-tomatine in the standard incubation medium with and
  without MCF-7 cells led to a 60–70% loss of α-tomatine during the first 24 h. A
  comparable decrease in α-tomatine was observed when inactivated serum was added
  to the medium.
- Thus, the decrease is not due to biotransformation by plasma enzymes.
- To screen the potential biotransformation by MCF-7 cells, a standard incubation
  medium with native fetal calf serum was used.
- Based on the α-tomatine structure, we anticipated that its biotransformation can
  proceed by deglycosidation or by oxidation (hydroxylation or N-oxidation) (24) of
  the aglycone.
- As these deglycosidated derivatives, with the exception of tomatidine, are not available
  on the market, acid hydrolysis of α-tomatine was carried out in order to get a reaction
  mixture containing compounds derived from α-tomatine by consecutive loss of sugar
  units.
- Hydrolysis products found in the reaction mixture are presented in Fig.
- 5B.
- Representative chromatograms for each compound were extracted from full scan data
  (Fig.
- 5B) and the retention times and masses (m/z) are presented in Table I.
- Retention times and m/z of pseudomolecular ions [M+H]+ of α-tomatine hydrolysis
  products.
- Subsequently, samples of the incubation media and MCF-7 cell pellets after 4, 24,
  48 and 72 h of incubation with 3 μM of α-tomatine were obtained and targeted metabolic
  screening for deglycosidated metabolites was carried out.
- Representative chromatograms (Fig.
- 5C) for metabolites possibly arising from deglycosidation were extracted from mass
  spectrometric data and compared with chromatograms of derivatives obtained by hydrolysis.
- Target metabolites were not found either in the incubation media or in the cell
  pellet.
- With this experiment, we proved that during incubation with an MCF-7 cell line,
  α-tomatine is not subjected to deglycosidation by biotransformation or by chemical
  decomposition.
- Samples were also tested for the presence of oxidative biotransformation products
  (hydroxylation, N-oxidation) of α-tomatine and tomatidine.
- Since chemical standards of these metabolites are not available and chemical synthesis
  is problematic, the mass spectrometric data obtained was only inspected for masses
  of suspected mono-hydroxy (Δ m/z 16), di-hydroxy (Δ m/z 32) or N-oxide derivatives
  (Δ m/z 16).
- None of these suspected metabolites were found in the samples.
- The mechanism of the cytotoxic action of α-tomatine has been studied intensively;
  nevertheless, the existing results differ significantly.
- In mouse EL4 lymphoma cells, α-tomatine at the concentration of 8 μM induces apoptosis
  with changes in the cell cycle distribution of these cells (53.8% sub-G1 peak) (19).
- In human prostatic adenocarcinoma PC-3 cells, a marked increase of apoptotic cells
  in sub-G1 phase (95%) was observed after treatment with 2 μM of α-tomatine for 24
  h (18).
- The induction of apoptosis is closely related to the activation of cysteine proteases
  called caspases (25).
- In PC-3 cells, the activation of caspase-3, -8 and -9 in 2 μM of α-tomatine-treated
  cells was demonstrated (18).
- Contrary to these results, the induction of programmed cell death with no changes
  in caspase-3, -6, -7, -8 and -9 activity and with no changes in cell cycle distribution
  was demonstrated in α-tomatine-treated human leukemic cells HL60 and K562 (14) as
  well as MOLT-4 (20).
- Similarly, we demonstrated that caspase-8 and -9 are not activated.
- Our results indicate no changes in cell cycle distribution, no apoptotic sub-G1
  peak in MCF-7 cells and no morphological signs of apoptosis after treatment with
  α-tomatine.
- α-Tomatine at the concentrations of 1–9 μM after 4 h induced neither SSBs nor DSBs
  detectable by comet assay in MCF-7 cells.
- Moreover, the activation of Chk2 related to DNA damage (26) was not detected.
- The tumor-suppressor phosphoprotein p53 plays a significant role in preventing inappropriate
  cell proliferation and maintaining genome integrity in response to genotoxic stress,
  resulting in cell-cycle arrest, DNA repair, apoptosis or senescence (27).
- Our experimental data show no changes in the level of p53 and p53 phosphorylated
  on serine 15 in MCF-7 cells after 4 and 24 h of α-tomatine treatment (1–6 μM).
- The levels of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21WAF1/CIP1 also remained unchanged.
- Apoptosis is a process highly dependent on the content of intracellular ATP; there
  is an evident physiological difference in cells undergoing apoptosis or necrosis
  (28).
- We demonstrated a loss of ATP in α-tomatine-treated cells (6 and 9 μM) after 72
  h, which supports the results of this study discussed above.
- A possible explanation of the cytotoxic mechanism could be the fact that cholesterol
  in biological membranes serves as a target for α-tomatine (see below).
- A number of studies have indicated that α-tomatine inhibits the growth of various
  human cancer cell lines at low μM concentrations within 1–48 h of treatment (14–18,20,21).
- Our results showed a cytotoxic effect of α-tomatine at slightly higher concentrations
  than in the previous studies.
- We demonstrated that 6 and 9 μM of α-tomatine caused an inhibition of proliferation
  and a decrease in viability after 24 h in MCF-7 cells.
- However, after 48 and 72 h of α-tomatine treatment, a recovery of these cells occurred.
- Our study also revealed a transient increase and activation of check-point kinase
  1 (Chk1) 4 h after α-tomatine application, which corresponds with the inhibition
  of proliferation.
- These changes in the levels of proteins disappeared after 24 h of incubation - an
  effect that corresponds with cell recovery.
- Chk1 is essential for cell viability and proliferation and for maintaining DNA integrity.
- Although it is active even in unperturbed cell cycles, it is further activated in
  response to DNA damage or stalled replication fork (26,29,30).
- We investigated why the cells recovered after 24 h of incubation.
- In the course of that, we observed a decrease in the levels of α-tomatine solved
  in the media throughout the incubation.
- As this phenomenon occurred only when cholesterol was present in the media, the
  formation of an insoluble α-tomatine cholesterol complex (2) should be the main
  reason.
- It was reported (31,32) that α-tomatine is, in contrast to the related saponins,
  not interface seeking.
- The accumulation of α-tomatine at the water-air interface should therefore not be
  the cause of its potential disappearing from the solution.
- Regarding biotransformation, fungal pathogens of tomato produce tomatinase enzymes
  which hydrolyze α-tomatine by removing the complete sugar moiety (β-lycotetraose)
  or partial sugars (9,24,33).
- Only aglycone (tomatidine) released is susceptible to hydroxylation by cytochrome
  P-450.
- Since the removal of even a single monosaccharide from the sugar moiety reduces
  the membranolytic activity of α-tomatine substantially (34), deglycosylation serves
  as a resistance mechanism of fungal pathogens.
- Our findings of no putative metabolites of α-tomatine, neither in the medium nor
  in cell pellets, are consistent with the current knowledge which suggests that mammalian
  cells do not metabolize α-tomatine.
- Cholesterol in the membranes of MCF-7 cells probably served as a target for α-tomatine
  as well.
- The release of the cytosolic enzyme LDH which occurred especially at concentrations
  of α-tomatine 6 and 9 μM, is a marker of membrane integrity loss typical for early
  necrosis and only the late stage of apoptosis (35).
- The absence of any characteristic features of apoptosis, the morphological signs
  as well as the ATP depletion observed, rather indicate necrotic cell death.
- Although the rupture of membranes occurs in necrosis mediated by different mechanisms
  (36), the binding of α-tomatine to membrane cholesterol and the consequent membrane
  disruption may have had a triggering effect in the present study (37,38).
- Membrane disintegration by several other agents was shown to induce necrosis (35,39).
- Steroidal glycoalkaloids form complexes with free 3β-hydroxy sterols, such as cholesterol,
  present in the outer leaflet of the plasma and outer mitochondrial membranes of
  animal cells.
- A network of these complexes undergoes a lateral aggregation through sugar-sugar
  interactions between the sugar moieties, causing a rearrangement and subsequent
  loss of the barrier function.
- α-Tomatine has the strongest membrane-disruptive effect of all Solanum glycoalkaloids
  studied thus far (34,38).
- In conclusion, our results show that a single application of α-tomatine has an antiproliferative
  effect on cancer cells within 24 h of incubation, but then the cells recover.
- Since α-tomatine is not biotransformed in the MCF-7 cell line via deglycosidation
  or oxidation during 72 h but the concentration of α-tomatine significantly decreases
  in solutions and media containing cholesterol, this effect is most probably related
  to the ability of α-tomatine to bind with cholesterol present in the culture medium.
- Our study is the first to describe this phenomenon, which should be taken into consideration
  when interpreting results from an in vitro assay with α-tomatine.
- α-Tomatine does not induce DNA damage or the activation of caspases; it does not
  change the levels of proteins p53 and p21 in the MCF-7 cell line but rather causes
  a decrease in the cellular ATP.
- These facts, along with the morphological changes observed, suggest that the decrease
  in viability of MCF-7 cells by α-tomatine is not due to apoptosis induction.
- A probable mechanism involved in the cytotoxicity is the membrane-disruptive effect
  due to its binding with membrane cholesterol.
