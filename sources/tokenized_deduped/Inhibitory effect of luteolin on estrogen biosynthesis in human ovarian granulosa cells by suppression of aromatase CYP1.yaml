- Inhibition of aromatase, the key enzyme in estrogen biosynthesis, is an important
  strategy in the treatment of breast cancer.
- Several dietary flavonoids show aromatase inhibitory activity, but their tissue
  specificity and mechanism remain unclear.
- This study found that the dietary flavonoid luteolin potently inhibited estrogen
  biosynthesis in a dose- and time-dependent manner in KGN cells derived from human
  ovarian granulosa cells, the major source of estrogens in premenopausal women.
- Luteolin decreased aromatase mRNA and protein expression in KGN cells.
- Luteolin also promoted aromatase protein degradation and inhibited estrogen biosynthesis
  in aromatase-expressing HEK293A cells, but had no effect on recombinant expressed
  aromatase.
- 'Estrogen biosynthesis in KGN cells was inhibited with differing potencies by extracts
  of onion and bird chili and by four other dietary flavonoids: kaempferol, quercetin,
  myricetin, and isorhamnetin.'
- The present study suggests that luteolin inhibits estrogen biosynthesis by decreasing
  aromatase expression and destabilizing aromatase protein, and it warrants further
  investigation as a potential treatment for estrogen-dependent cancers.
- Estrogen is a sex steroid hormone and plays a pivotal role in the regulation of
  many biological processes.
- Estrogen is known to induce physiological responses in the reproductive tract, mammary
  tissue, and the pituitary gland and to affect nonreproductive processes such as
  bone formation and cardiovascular health.
- (1) The biological actions of estrogen are mediated through nuclear and membrane
  estrogen receptors (ERs), which are expressed in a variety of cell types and mediate
  the genomic and nongenomic effects of estrogen.
- (1) Numerous factors have been implicated in the increased incidence of breast cancer
  in humans, including the Western-style diet and environmental endocrine-disrupting
  chemicals, which are thought to alter the production, metabolism, and action of
  estrogen.
- (2, 3) Some ER antagonists such as tamoxifen and fulvestrant have been widely used
  to treat hormone-responsive breast cancer, but their clinical use is often limited
  by side effects including vaginal bleeding, thromboembolism, and increased risk
  of endometrial cancer.
- (4) Fruits and vegetables are rich in flavonoids such as genistein.
- These compounds are structurally similar to estrogen and are well-known for their
  cancer-preventive effects, which are partly mediated through competitive inhibition
  of the ER.
- However, flavonoids also exhibit estrogenic activity that can enhance cell proliferation
  in the uterus and the mammary gland.
- (5, 6) Thus, reduction of estrogen levels by means of inhibition of endogenous estrogen
  biosynthesis becomes another option in the prevention and treatment of estrogen-mediated
  carcinogenesis.

  In humans, estrogen biosynthesis occurs at a number of different sites, with the
  major sites being the granulosa cells of the ovary in premenopausal women and stromal
  cells of the adipose tissue in postmenopausal women.'
- (8) In women, estrogen is also produced locally at other sites, including the brain,
  bone, and breast.
- Estrogen biosynthesis is catalyzed by aromatase (cytochrome P450 19; CYP19), which
  binds the C19 androgenic steroid substrate and catalyzes successive reactions to
  form the phenolic A ring characteristic of estrogens.
- (9) In humans, aromatase expression at various sites is regulated by tissue-specific
  promoters by alternative splicing mechanisms.
- (10) In the ovary and testes, aromatase expression is controlled by promoter II,
  which binds the transcription factors cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB)
  and steroidogenic factor-1.
- Aromatase expression in the gonads is thus regulated by gonadotropins through stimulation
  of cAMP generation.
- (11) Aromatase inhibitors such as anastrozole, letrozole, and exemestane have been
  developed for the treatment of hormone-dependent breast cancer in postmenopausal
  women, and they show superior efficacy to conventional antiestrogen receptor drugs
  such as tamoxifen.
- (12) However, the estrogen deprivation that results from inhibition of aromatase
  activity leads to side effects such as increased risk for osteoporosis and cardiovascular
  disease.
- (13) Thus, there remains a need to discover and develop novel aromatase inhibitors
  that offer greater clinical efficacy and fewer side effects than the currently available
  drugs.
- Several natural flavonoids are known to be potent aromatase inhibitors; this activity
  partly contributes to the importance of certain vegetables and fruits in the daily
  diet to decrease the risk of chronic diseases.
- (14-16) Luteolin (3′,4′,5,7-tetrahydroxyflavone) is one of the most common flavonoids
  present in edible and medicinal plants.
- Preclinical studies have shown that this compound possesses a variety of pharmacological
  activities, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and anticancer
  activities.
- (17) Accumulating evidence suggests that luteolin could be developed as an anticancer
  agent to sensitize some tumor cells, such as tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing
  ligand-sensitive or -resistant cancer cells and hepatoma cells, for apoptosis.
- (18, 19) Luteolin has also been proposed to be a promising adjuvant for multiple
  sclerosis therapy due to its additive effects with interferon-β in modulating the
  immune responses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from multiple sclerosis
  patients.
- (20) Dietary sources of luteolin include celery, green peppers, bird chili, onion,
  parsley, cabbages, and apple skin.
- Although luteolin is found to inhibit estrogen biosynthesis in breast cancer MCF-7
  cells, preadipocyte cells and placental choriocarcinoma JEG-3 cells, its tissue
  specificity and mechanism of action remain poorly understood.

  units/mL), and streptomycin (0.1 mg/mL).
- For the transient transfections, subconfluent HEK293A cells grown in 24-well plates
  were cotransfected with 0.5 μg of pCMV6-aromatase plasmid and 0.3 μg of pSV-β-galactosidase
  plasmid using Trans-EZ transfection reagent according to the the manufacturer’s
  protocol (Sunbio Medical Biotechnology, Shanghai, China).

  24 h. Alamar Blue reagent (10 μL/well) was added, and the fluorescence intensities
  were measured using a Verioskan Flash Multimode Reader with excitation at 544 nm
  and emission at 590 nm.
- Cytotoxicity was defined as the ratio of the fluorescence intensity in test wells
  to that in solvent control wells (0.1% DMSO).
- The assay was conducted three times in triplicate.
- The IC50 value was obtained by fitting dose–response data to a four-parametric logistic
  nonlinear regression model using GraphPad Prism 5.0 software (GraphPad, La Jolla,
  CA, USA).
- KGN cells or transiently transfected HEK293A cells were seeded in 24-well plates
  and cultured overnight.
- The next day, the medium was replaced with serum-free medium, and the cells were
  pretreated for 24 h with the test chemicals.
- Testosterone (10 nM) was then added to each well, and the cells were incubated for
  a further 24 h. At the end of this incubation, the culture supernatants were collected
  and stored at −20 °C.
- Levels of 17β-estradiol in the supernatants were quantified using a magnetic particle-based
  enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions
  (Bio-Ekon Biotechnology, Beijing, China).
- Optical densities (OD) were measured at 550 nm using a Verioskan Flash Multimode

  as percentage 17β-estradiol production compared with the control samples.
- Protein determination was carried out with a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay
  kit (Bestbio, Shanghai, China).
- For the calculation of the IC50 value of luteolin in inhibiting estrogen biosynthesis,
  various concentrations of luteolin (1 nM, 5 nM, 10 nM, 50 nM, 1 μM, 5 μM, 10 μM,
  35 μM) were used to treat KGN cells for 24 h. Testosterone (10 nM) was then added
  to each well, and the cells were incubated for a further 24 h. The IC50 value was
  obtained by fitting dose–response data to a four-parametric logistic nonlinear regression
  model using GraphPad Prism 5.0 software.
- An in vitro recombinant expressed aromatase activity assay was conducted as described
  previously with minor modifications.
- (24, 25) In brief, the test compounds (5 μL) were preincubated with an NADPH regenerating
  system (45 μL of 2.6 mM NADP+, 7.6 mM glucose-6-phosphate, 0.8 U/mL glucose-6-phosphate
  dehydrogenase, and 1 mg/mL albumin, in 50 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.4) for 10
  min at 37 °C before 50 μL of the enzyme and substrate mixture (40 pM recombinant
  aromatase and 0.4 μM dibenzylfluorescein in 50 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.4) was
  added.
- The reaction mixture was then incubated for 2 h at 37 °C to allow the aromatase
  to generate the product and then quenched with 37.5 μL of 2 N NaOH.
- The mixture was then shaken for 5 min and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C to enhance
  the noise/background ratio.
- The fluorescence intensity was measured at 485 nm (excitation) and 530 nm (emission).
- Three independent experiments were performed in duplicate.
- Cells cultured in 60 mm dishes were lysed with RIPA lysis buffer (Beyotime, Haimen,
  China) supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma).
- The protein concentration was determined by using a BCA protein assay kit (Bestbio).
- Aliquots of total cell lysates (40 μg protein) were mixed in loading buffer, boiled
  for 5 min, and subjected to SDS-PAGE (10%).
- Proteins were blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes.
- The membranes were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin and then incubated at 4
  °C overnight with rabbit anti-human aromatase monoclonal antibody (1:500 dilution)
  or rabbit anti-human GAPDH monoclonal antibody (1:5000 dilution) (Epitomics, Burlingame,
  CA, USA).
- Membranes were then incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit
  secondary antibody (1:5000 dilution, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA)
  and developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Bioscience,
  Piscataway, NJ, USA).
- The intensity of each signal was determined by a computer image analysis system
  (Quantity One, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).
- Total cellular RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent according to the manufacturer’s
  instructions (Invitrogen).
- The purity of extracted RNA was determined by examining the ratio of the absorbance
  at 260 and 280 nm using a Verioskan Flash Multimode Reader (Thermo Scientific).
- The value of 1.8–2.0 for A260/A280 indicates that the RNA is pure.
- The concentration of extracted RNA was determined by examining the absorbance at
  260 nm.
- An A260 reading of 1.0 is univalent to 40 μg/mL of RNA.
- Total RNA (2 μg) was reverse-transcribed using SuperScript III rReverse Transcriptase
  (Invitrogen) with oligo(dT)18 primers.
- Equal amounts of cDNA were subjected to real-time quantitative PCR with the fluorescent
  dye SYBR Green I using a Chromo4 detection system (Bio-Rad).
- Reaction mixtures contained 12.5 μL of 2× TransStart Top Green qPCR SuperMix (TransGen
  Biotech), 0.5 μL of each primer (0.2 μM), and 1 μL of template cDNA.
- Sterile distilled water was added to a final volume of 25 μL.
- The primer pair for aromatase was 5′-ACCCTTCTGCGTCGTGTC-3′ (sense) and 5′-TCTGTGGAAATCCTGCGTCTT-3′
  (antisense), and that for GAPDH was 5′-CCACCCATGGCAAATTCCATGGCA-3′ (sense) and 5′-GGTGGACCTGACCTGCCGTCTAGA-3′

  10 s, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 5 s, 54 °C for 15 s, and 72 °C for 15 s.
  Standard curves were established for each primer set, and both reference and target
  gene reactions were performed for each sample.
- The relative quantity (_n_-fold) of aromatase mRNA was calculated by the Δ (Δ_C_t)
  method by using GAPDH amplified from the same sample as a reference.
- Samples of bird chili and onion were extracted and hydrolyzed to aglycons using
  a method modified from that of Miean et al.

- 'Effect of Luteolin on Estrogen Biosynthesis in Human Ovarian Granulosa-like KGN
  Cells


  We screened a chemical library consisting of 1431 natural products for small molecule
  modulators of estrogen biosynthesis(27) and identified luteolin, a natural flavone,
  as a potent inhibitor of estrogen biosynthesis in human granulosa-like KGN cells.'
- The chemical structure of luteolin is given in Figure 1A.
- To examine the effect of luteolin on 17β-estradiol synthesis, KGN cells were incubated
  for 24 h with various concentrations of the test compounds followed by a further
  24 h incubation with testosterone.
- As shown in Figure 1B, forskolin (FSK), which is an adenylate cyclase agonist and
  up-regulates aromatase expression by increasing intracellular cAMP levels and activating
  the protein kinase A (PKA)/CREB pathway,(28) significantly increased the production
  of 17β-estradiol, whereas formestane (FOR), an aromatase inhibitor in clinical use
  for the treatment of breast cancer,(29) significantly inhibited 17β-estradiol biosynthesis.
- These results indicated that the established assay is suitable for examining the
  effect of bioactive compounds on estrogen biosynthesis.
- At 10 μM, luteolin (LUT) significantly inhibited 17β-estradiol biosynthesis and
  had a more potent effect than 50 μM formestane.
- Luteolin at 10 μM also potently inhibited forskolin-induced 17β-estradiol biosynthesis.
- Figure 1.
- 'Effect of luteolin on estrogen biosynthesis in KGN cells: (A) presents the chemical
  structure of luteolin.'
- (B) KGN cells seeded in 24-well plates overnight were pretreated with the test compounds

- Concentrations of 17β-estradiol in the culture supernatants were quantified by ELISA.
- (C) presents the concentration–response curve of luteolin (1 nM, 5 nM, 10 nM, 50

- To examine the effect of luteolin on estrogen biosynthesis in more detail, KGN cells
  were treated with luteolin at concentrations between 1 nM and 50 μM.
- As shown in Figure 1C, luteolin inhibited 17β-estradiol biosynthesis in a concentration-dependent
  manner, with a calculated IC50 value of 1.17 μM.
- Inhibition of 17β-estradiol biosynthesis by luteolin also exhibited a time-dependence
  manner (Figure 1D).
- Inhibition of estrogen secretion was first evident at 12 h and was sustained until
  96 h, when 17β-estradiol biosynthesis was inhibited by approximately 80% compared
  with the control (Figure 1D).
- The tested concentrations of luteolin were not cytotoxic to KGN cells (see Figure
  S1 in the Supporting Information).
- These results indicate that luteolin could potently inhibit the biosynthesis of
  estrogen in human ovarian granulosa cells.
- KGN cells lack endogenous 17α-hydroxylase and cannot synthesize androgens or estrogens
  de novo.
- (30) Therefore, the 17β-estradiol measured in the culture supernatants was likely
  synthesized from the exogenously added testosterone through the action of aromatase—the
  only enzyme able to convert testosterone to 17β-estradiol.
- To determine whether luteolin inhibits 17β-estradiol biosynthesis through an effect
  on aromatase, we examined aromatase mRNA and protein levels in KGN cells treated
  with luteolin.
- As previously reported,(28, 31) we found that aromatase mRNA levels were significantly
  increased in cells treated by forskolin and significantly inhibited by formestane
  (Figure 2A).
- Luteolin inhibited aromatase transcript levels by about 50% compared with the DMSO-treated
  control cells.
- Aromatase protein expression was also examined by Western blotting of KGN cell lysates
  following treatment with luteolin.
- Consistent with their effects on aromatase transcription, luteolin and formestane
  treatmenta of KGN cells reduced the expression of aromatase protein, whereas forskolin
  treatment increased the expression (Figure 2B).
- These results indicate that luteolin inhibits estrogen biosynthesis in KGN cells
  by decreasing the expression of aromatase.
- Figure 2.
- Luteolin inhibits aromatase expression in KGN cells.
- KGN cells were pretreated for 24 h with 10 μM luteolin, 10 μM forskolin, or 50 μM
  formestane.
- (A) Aromatase mRNA was measured in total cellular RNA by using real-time qPCR.
- The results are expressed as fold increase relative to levels in untreated cells.
- GAPDH was used as an internal control.
- (B) Cell lysates were immunoblotted with anti-aromatase or anti-GAPDH antibodies.

- 'Effect of Luteolin on Estrogen Biosynthesis in Aromatase-Expressing HEK293A Cells


  To further confirm that luteolin exerts it inhibitory effect on estrogen biosynthesis
  by suppression of aromatase, HEK293A cells, which do not express aromatase, were
  transiently transfected with an aromatase expression vector and then treated with
  luteolin before the addition of testosterone.'
- As shown in Figure 3A, 17β-estradiol biosynthesis by HEK293A cells was decreased
  by formestane and by luteolin in a concentration-dependent manner, consistent with
  the results in KGN cells.
- Furthermore, luteolin at 50 μM was found to significantly decrease aromatase protein
  expression in HEK293A cells compared with the DMSO- or formestane-treated cells
  (Figure 3B).
- These results indicate that luteolin exerts it inhibitory effect on estrogen biosynthesis
  by promoting aromatase protein degradation.
- Figure 3.
- Effect of luteolin on estrogen biosynthesis in aromatase-expressing HEK293A cells.
- HEK293A cells were cotransfected with pCMV6-aromatase and pSV-β-galactosidase expression

  24 h, and then testosterone was added for a further 24 h. (A) 17β-Estradiol concentrations

- Flavonoids have long been found to act directly on aromatase to inhibit its catalytic
  activity.
- (14) To examine whether luteolin can directly inhibit aromatase activity, we conducted
  an in vitro assay by using recombinant expressed aromatase.
- As shown in Figure 4, formestane inhibited aromatase activity in a concentration-dependent
  manner, as reported.
- (24) Compared with that, luteolin had no effect on aromatase activity.
- These results indicate that luteolin does not directly inhibit aromatase activity
  as other active flavonoids generally do.
- Figure 4.
- Effect of luteolin on aromatase activity in vitro.
- An in vitro aromatase assay using recombinant expressed aromatase and dibenzylfluorescein
  as a substrate was conducted as described under Materials and Methods.
- Various concentrations of formestane and luteolin were added into the mixtures containing
  recombinant expressed aromatase and NADPH regenerating system, and fluorescence
  intensity induced by the aromatase-catalyzed dibenzylfluorescein hydrolysis was
  detected.
- Cont., DMSO control; FOR, formestane; LUT, luteolin.
- (∗∗∗) _p_ &lt; 0.001 compared with the control (_n_ = 3).
- We next examined the effects of several flavonoids found in commonly consumed vegetables
  and fruits on estrogen biosynthesis.
- First, KGN cells were treated with various concentrations of kaempferol, quercetin,
  myricetin, or isorhamnetin to test their effects on cell viability and to determine
  the optimal concentrations for estrogen biosynthesis assays (see Figure S2 in the
  Supporting Information).
- The chemical structures of these flavonoids are given in Figure 5A.
- As shown in Figure 5B, kaempferol inhibited 17β-estradiol biosynthesis by KGN cells
  in a concentration-dependent manner, with approximately 30 and 50% inhibition following
  treatment with 10 and 50 μM kaempferol, respectively.
- Quercetin inhibited 17β-estradiol biosynthesis by up to 75% at a high concentration
  (50 μM) but increased 17β-estradiol biosynthesis slightly when added at low concentrations
  (1–10 μM).
- Myricetin inhibited 17β-estradiol biosynthesis at a low concentration (0.1 μM) but
  had no effect at higher concentrations (1–10 μM).
- In contrast, isorhamnetin had no effect on 17β-estradiol biosynthesis at any concentration
  examined (1–50 μM).
- These results indicate that kaempferol and quercetin potently inhibit estrogen biosynthesis
  in KGN cells, whereas myricetin and isorhamnetin show only weak or no effects.
- Figure 5.

- Onion and bird chili are commonly consumed vegetables that are natural sources of
  luteolin; therefore, we next investigated whether extracts of onion or bird chili
  could affect estrogen biosynthesis.
- Quantification of quercetin and luteolin in the extracts indicated that onion contained
  high amounts of both quercetin and luteolin, whereas bird chili contained relatively
  low levels of both compounds (Table 1).
- KGN cells were treated with various noncytotoxic concentrations of the extracts
  (see Figure S3 in the Supporting Information).
- As shown in Figure 6A, a high concentration (500 μg/mL) of onion extract potently
  inhibited 17β-estradiol biosynthesis, whereas the bird chili extract had no such
  effect.
- We then examined the effect of onion extracts on aromatase expression in KGN cells.
- As shown in Figure 6B, onion extracts (100–500 μg/mL) could significantly decrease
  aromatase protein expression.
- We also examined the effect of the vegetable extracts on estrogen biosynthesis in
  aromatase-expressing HEK293A cells.
- In contrast to the effects on KGN cells, both onion and bird chili extracts significantly
  inhibited 17β-estradiol biosynthesis in HEK293A cells in a concentration-dependent
  manner (1–100 μg/mL) (Figure 6C).
- These results indicate the onion and bird chili extracts can inhibit estrogen biosynthesis,
  and the inhibitory potency is concentration- and cell type-dependent.
- Figure 6.
- Effects of onion and bird chili extracts on estrogen biosynthesis.
- (A) KGN cells were seeded in 24-well plates overnight and pretreated with the plant

  in the culture supernatants were quantified by ELISA.

- "Quantification of Quercetin and Luteolin in Onion and Bird Chili Extracts  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn
  the ovary, a major tissue for estrogen biosynthesis in premenopausal women, aromatase
  expression is regulated through a follicle-stimulating hormone-mediated cAMP pathway."
- (28) In the present study, we found luteolin could significantly decrease aromatase
  mRNA expression in KGN cells derived from the ovary.
- This is consistent with an observation in MCF-7 breast cancer cells that luteolin
  inhibits AP-1 binding in the I.3/II promoter region of aromatase and reduces aromatase
  mRNA expression.
- (21) In KGN cells, aromatase expression is mainly controlled by promoter II; thus,
  it is possible that luteolin inhibits aromatase expression in these cells by similar
  mechanism a to that in MCF-7 cells.
- Luteolin has been shown to decrease intracellular cAMP levels and inhibit melanin
  production in B16 melanoma cells treated with α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone,(32)
  further indicating that luteolin may modulate the cAMP pathway to decrease aromatase
  transcription in KGN cells.
- Exemestane, an aromatase inhibitor used clinically, has been shown to promote aromatase
  degradation through the ubiquitin/26S proteasome pathway in aromatase-overexpressing
  MCF-7 cells without effect on the aromatase mRNA expression.
- (33) Similar to this, we found that luteolin significantly promoted aromatase degradation
  in aromatase-transfected HEK293A cells, in which the expression of aromatase was
  driven by a constitutive CMV promoter.
- Luteolin is not a general gene expression inhibitor and has no effect on CMV promoter-driven
  gene transcription,(19, 34) so it may directly change the aromatase stability at
  the protein level.
- Luteolin promotes the X-linked inhibitor of apopotosis protein ubiquitination and
  proteasomal degradation by inhibition of protein kinase C (PKC).
- (18) Thus, it will be of great interest to investigate whether luteolin and exemestane
  promote aromatase degradation by the same mechanism and whether PKC is a novel regulator
  for aromatase ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation.
- No direct inhibitory effect of luteolin on recombinant expressed aromatase was observed,
  which was inconsistent with the observation that luteolin can inhibit aromatase
  activity by using partially purified aromatase prepared from human placenta.
- (35) This discrepancy is possible due to the different in vitro assay methods used.
- However, we found that luteolin exhibited the aromatase inhibitory effect only beginning
  at 12 h, indicating it may not directly inhibit the enzyme catalytic activity.
- Thus, whether luteolin can directly modulate the catalytic activity of aromatase
  needs to be further studied.
- Taken together with previous observations that some flavonoids such as apigenin
  and kaempferol can directly inhibit the catalytic activity of aromatase in placental
  microsomes or purified aromatase,(14) our results indicate that inhibition of aromatase
  by flavonoids may result from inhibition of aromatase expression, aromatase catalytic
  activity, and/or destabilization of aromatase protein.
- Aromatase inhibitors derived from food sources or traditional medicines are preferred
  for more tissue specificity and less toxicity than those currently in clinical use.
- (14) We compared five widely consumed food-derived flavonoids—luteolin, isorhamnetin,
  quercetin, kaempferol, and myricetin—for their ability to inhibit aromatase activity.
- All except isorhamnetin could inhibit aromatase activity, albeit with differing
  potencies.
- Luteolin, one of the potent naturally occurring aromatase inhibitors, is present
  in many vegetables and fruits known to have multiple health benefits.
- (17) One of the prominent side effects of clinically used aromatase inhibitors is
  the increased risk for osteoporosis due to whole-body depletion of estrogen.
- However, luteolin has been found to have antiosteoporotic effects in vitro and in
  vivo through stimulation of osteoblast function and inhibition of osteoclast function.
- (36, 37) Luteolin appears to be a safe natural flavonoid because long-term administration
  to rats (30 mg/kg orally for 20 days) did not reveal any obvious toxicity.
- (38) Thus, it will be important to examine whether luteolin can inhibit estrogen
  biosynthesis in vivo.
- A maximal plasma concentration of 3 μM luteolin was measured following oral dosing
  of rats with 15 mg/kg luteolin.
- (39) In the present study, we found that luteolin inhibited estrogen biosynthesis
  at a concentration as low as 1 μM.
- Thus, oral dosing with luteolin could achieve physiologically relevant plasma concentrations
  to inhibit aromatase enzyme activity and expression, making it one of the most promising
  flavonoids for therapeutic targeting of aromatase.
- Flavonoids with potent aromatase inhibitory activities, such as chrysin, naringenin,
  and apigenin, failed to inhibit uterine growth via aromatase in vivo.
- (40) The contradiction was possibly due to the negative feedback effect of estrogen
  depletion by increased secretion of follicle-stimulating hormone from the hypothalamus
  in rats with functional ovaries.
- (41) Thus, the ovariectomized rats with the aromatase-overexpressing MCF-7 breast
  tumor should be used to evaluate the efficacy of these flavonoids, including luteolin,
  in the inhibition of aromatase-mediated breast tumorigenesis in vivo to obviate
  such negative feedback effect.
- Overexposure to environmental estrogenic compounds and the Western-style diet have
  contributed to the increased incidence of breast cancer.
- (2, 3) In contrast, consumption of large quantities of fruits and vegetables conveys
  protection against a variety of cancers, including breast cancer.
- (16) It has been found that red wine, grape seed, white button mushroom, and beer
  can inhibit aromatase activity and modulate estrogen biosynthesis.
- (42-46) Despite this, the role of fruits and vegetables in endogenous estrogen biosynthesis
  is still largely unknown.
- In this study, we compared two luteolin-containing vegetables—onion and bird chili—for
  their effects on estrogen biosynthesis.
- Interestingly, onion extracts significantly inhibited estrogen biosynthesis in both
  KGN cells and aromatase-expressing HEK293A cells, whereas bird chili extracts inhibited
  estrogen biosynthesis only in the HEK293A cells.
- The difference is possibly due to the cell permeability of the compounds, their
  composition, or concentration range of flavonoids contained in the food source.
- Different combinations of flavonoids may also change the solubility and/or accessibility
  of the compounds to intracellular aromatase or may act on aromatase through different
  mechanisms.
- As an example, some dietary flavonoids such as hesperetin can increase aromatase
  expression.
- (21) Thus, the composition and concentrations of flavonoids and the cell type being
  tested should be considered when fruits and vegetables are compared for their effects
  on estrogen biosynthesis.
- In conclusion, we identified luteolin, distributed widely in consumed fruits and
  vegetables, as a potent inhibitor of estrogen biosynthesis in human ovarian granulosa-like
  KGN cells by decreasing aromatase expression and promoting its degradation.
- We also showed that other daily consumed flavonoids, including isorhamnetin, quercetin,
  kaempferol, and myricetin, inhibited estrogen biosynthesis with differing potencies.
- Two widely consumed vegetables, onion and bird chili, also differed in their ability
  to inhibit estrogen biosynthesis in KGN cells and in aromatase-expressing HEK293A
  cells.
- The present study suggests that luteolin may exert its estrogen biosynthesis inhibitory
  effect through suppression of aromatase expression and promotion of aromatase degradation,
  and it warrants further investigation as a potential agent for the treatment of
  breast cancer.
- Consumption of fruits and vegetables rich in flavonoids will be helpful for reducing
  endogenous estrogen levels in the prevention of estrogen-dependent disease, such
  as breast cancer.
