- In order to determine the metal concentrations in cultured oysters from four coastal
  lagoons from SE Gulf of California, several individuals of _Crassostrea gigas_ and
  _C.
- corteziensis_ were collected and their cadmium, copper, lead and zinc levels were
  measured by atomic absorption spectrometry after acid digestion.
- The concentration of metals in oyster soft tissue was Zn &gt; Cu &gt; Cd &gt; Pb.
- In two lagoons, Cd concentrations (10.1–13.5 μg g−1 dw) exceeded the maximum level
  allowed according to the Official Mexican Standard (NOM-031-SSA1-1993), which is
  equivalent to the WHO recommended Cd levels in organisms used for human consumption.
- Cadmium, copper, lead and zinc, accumulate in the tissues of aquatic organisms at
  concentrations higher than in water, may be biomagnified in the food chain and cause
  physiological impairment at higher trophic levels and in human consumers.
- For the purposes of assessing coastal water quality, oysters of _Crassostrea_ genus
  have already been proposed as sentinel organisms for marine ecotoxicological tests,
  because they are very sensitive to pollutants and provide a rapid response (Zhou
  et al.
- 2008).
- The Pacific and the mangrove oysters (_C.
- gigas_ and _C.
- corteziensis_, respectively), are cultivated inside coastal lagoons, hence the oysters
  are susceptible to contamination by metals and other chemicals (Osuna-Martínez et
  al.
- 2010).
- Therefore, this study was conducted to determine and compare the concentration of
  Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn in the soft tissue of _C.
- gigas_ and _C.
- corteziensis_ specimens from four coastal lagoons (SE Gulf of California, Mexico).
- 'This study was performed at four oyster farms located in four coastal lagoons from
  Sinaloa state, SE Gulf of California, Mexico: El Colorado (EC), Santa María-La Reforma
  (SMLR), Altata (ALT) and Ceuta (CEU) (Fig.'
- 1).
- A total of six samples of cultured oysters _C.
- gigas_ and two samples of _C.
- corteziensis_ (species restricted to only one farm) were collected during the dry
  and rainy season in duplicate.
- Once cleaned, the oyster shells were measured (mm) and weighed (total and soft tissue,
  g).
- 'The condition index (CI) was determined by: CI = [soft tissue dry wt (g) × 1,000]/shell
  dry wt (g).'
- The soft tissue of the groups (each batch of 25 oysters) was extracted, homogenized,
  freeze-dried over 72 h (−49°C and 133 × 10−3 mbar) and then ground in an automatic
  agate mortar.
- Finally, they were kept frozen until their digestion (&lt;3 months) (Osuna-Martínez
  et al.
- 2010).
- Analyses were carried out by atomic absorption spectrometry with flame detection
  (Cd, Cu and Zn) and grafite furnace (Pb) (Jara-Marini et al.
- 2008).
- For metal quality control purposes, certified mussel material (Standard Reference
  Material® 2976, from NIST) was analyzed (recoveries from 113.9 to 119.6%).
- The limits of detection were 0.06, 3.6, 0.44 and 11.3 μg g−1, for Cd, Cu, Pb and
  Zn, respectively.
- Additionally, one blank was included per each set of 14 samples.
- One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed, which showed significant differences
  between the mean concentrations, and correlation analysis (bivariate correlations)
  were used in order to find the relationships among the concentrations of these metals
  in the oysters.
- 'Location of the study area: coastal lagoons from Sinaloa, where cultured oysters
  were collected.'
- 'The point (_filled circle_) indicates the approximate position of the farms




  In spite that organisms had similar sizes, the mean weights were different from
  one season to another, therefore, the soft tissue weight was higher in samples from
  the dry season, when the condition index is greater (Table 1 from Osuna-Martínez
  et al.'
- 2010).
- The concentration of metals in oyster soft tissues were Zn &gt; Cu &gt; Cd &gt;
  Pb, and their global mean concentrations for _C.
- gigas_ for the rainy and dry season were 8.05 ± 2.60 and 11.30 ± 2.70 μg g−1 (dw)
  for Cd, 35.1 ± 16.1 and 16.0 ± 10.3 for Cu, 1.52 ± 0.43 and 0.92 ± 0.45 for Pb,
  and 342 ± 116 and 156 ± 41 for Zn, respectively.
- For this species, higher mean concentrations of Cd were found during the dry season,
  as well as for _C.
- corteziensis_ in CEU lagoon.
- This increase on the bioavailability of Cd during dry season could be explained
  by the presence of upwelling regime during this season, since the Gulf of California
  is characterized by the upwellings events along its eastern coast, normally from
  February to April (Staines-Urías et al.
- 2009).
- The average Cd concentration trend for the _C.
- gigas_ specimens were SMLR &gt; CEU &gt; EC and SMLR &gt; ALT &gt; CEU, during the
  rainy and dry seasons, respectively.
- At both cases, the oysters from SMLR had the highest concentrations.
- This could be related to the extension of the lagoon mouth at SMLR (which has two
  big mouths) and its closer distance from the farm location.
- For Cu, Pb and Zn, the highest concentrations were found during the rainy season
  in all the lagoons, for both species, which is in agreement with Frías-Espericueta
  et al_._ (1999), who found the highest concentrations of Cu, Pb and Zn in autumn,
  when the oysters were in resting phase.
- Besides, this pattern implies a higher input of these metals from the watershed.
- 'These three metals showed the same trend among the concentration levels of the
  different lagoons at both seasons (Rainy: EC &gt; CEU &gt; SMLR; Dry: ALT &gt; CEU
  &gt; SMLR), except for Zn during rainy season (CEU &gt; EC &gt; SMLR).'
- However; in all cases SMLR had the lowest concentrations in contrast to the Cd results.
- Again, its position farthest from the inlet could be playing an important role in
  the availability of these three metals (Fig.
- 2).

- The maximum tolerable values are indicated by _dashed lines_, rainy and dry season
  data are represented by _filled_ and _unfilled bars_, respectively.
- 'Different _letters_ for a particular metal show significant differences (_p_ &lt;
  0.05) among sites


  A linear model was applied in which the Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn concentrations in the
  tissues of _C.'
- gigas_ were plotted as a function of the CI; the results showed only a good correlation
  coefficient for Zn, which was negatively correlated to the CI (_r_ = −0.86; _p_
  &lt; 0.05); which is in agreement with the analyses made in mussels (_Mytilus edulis_)
  by Mubiana et al.
- (2006) and in the same oysters for Hg (Osuna-Martínez et al.
- 2010).
- Bivariate correlation analyses (with Pearson correlation coefficient) among these
  four metals were made; the results showed a significant correlation just for Cu-Pb
  (_r_ = 0.93; _p_ &lt; 0.05), while Pb showed to be closely related to Zn, but it
  did not reached a significant correlation (_r_ = 0.80; _p_ &gt; 0.05).
- These results differ from the ones found for _C.
- iridescens_ (Frías-Espericueta et al.
- 1999), which show no correlation for Cu-Pb and a negative correlation for Pb–Zn.
- Nevertheless, they are in agreement to the correlations found for the mussels _Mytilus
  galloprovincialis_ (Szefer et al.
- 2004).
- Such correlations indicate that the metals involved have similar physical/chemical
  properties of the involved elements (Szefer et al.
- 1994).
- According to the WHO (1982) and the Official Mexican Standard (NOM-031-SSA1-1993),
  the maximum permissible levels for these metals are equivalent to 10, 50, 5 and
  500 μg g−1, dry wt (ca_._ 80% humidity) for Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn, respectively.
- Cd levels exceeded the permitted levels in ALT during the dry season and in SMLR
  during both seasons; Cu concentration was higher than the permitted level in EC
  only during dry season; while Pb and Zn showed levels lower than the permitted limit
  (Fig.
- 2).
- The Expert Committee on Food Additives (WHO, 2003) has established regulatory guidelines
  regarding the dietary intake of metals, it recommends for Cd (a metal of concern),
  a provisional tolerable weekly intake (PTWI) of 7 μg kg−1 body weight.
- Such concentration is equivalent to 490 μg Cd/week for a 70 kg person.
- According to the results of this study, during the dry season, the mean concentration
  of Cd in both cultured species was 8.5 μg g−1 dry wt, equivalent to 42.5 μg g−1
  wet wt.
- Therefore, ca.
- 11.53 g wet wt is the total weekly maximum amount of oysters harvested from this
  region that could be consumed by a 70 kg person without exceeding a body cadmium
  concentration of 7 μg kg−1 on a weekly basis.
- Normally, the persons consume 6 or until 12 oysters, consequently, such PTWI may
  be easily reached.
- From these results is evident the risk of Cd by consumption of these oysters and
  the need of more research in this context is justified.
- In the case of the CEU samples, both species were collected from the same farm (site
  and depth); therefore, they were exposed under the same water conditions and levels
  of metals.
- 'Although there were a limited number of samples collected (n = 8), the analysis
  of correlation of metal content between the two species: _C.'
- corteziensis_ (x) and _C.
- gigas_ (y) revealed a significant correlation (_p_ &lt; 0.05) for Cu, y = 0.484,
  x + 2.514 (_r_ = 0.97); Pb, y = 0.348, x + 0.079 (_r_ = 0.98); and Zn, y = 0.349,
  x + 62.213 (_r_ = 0.99).
- These equations may be useful in the intercomparison of metals levels among different
  sites involving these two species in monitoring programs.
- In the case of Cd, although was obtained a _r_ = 0.89, it was not statistically
  significant (_p_ &gt; 0.05).
- Clearly a higher number of samples are required to examine reliably such correlations.
- Table 1 shows a comparison between metal concentrations in _C.
- gigas_ and _C.
- corteziensis_ from different sites around the world and the values found in this
  study.
- In the case of Cd for both species, the determined concentrations in this study
  are higher than the registered for other sites of the world.
- But for _C.
- corteziensis_ they are comparable with the results of studies done in the same region
  (Páez-Osuna et al.
- 2002; Frías-Espericueta et al_._ 2009).
- The Cu and Pb concentrations are comparable (for _C.
- gigas_) or less (for _C.
- corteziensis_) and the Zn levels are less, for both species, than the levels found
  in other regions.
- From this work, emerge the need of research the mechanisms and sources of metals
  associated with the enrichment of such metals in cultured oysters in both seasons;
  which apparently for Cu, Pb and Zn is connected in rainy months with transported
  material from the watershed, while in dry season the higher availability of Cd is
  related to upwellings in the Gulf of California.
