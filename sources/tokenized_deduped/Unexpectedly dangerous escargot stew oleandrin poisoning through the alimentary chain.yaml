- A female, aged 43 and a male, aged 66, experienced gastrointestinal and cardiovascular
  symptoms after a meal including snail stew.
- Twelve hours after the ingestion, they presented with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
  and cardiovascular symptoms typical of acute toxic digoxin ingestion and were hospitalized.
- The man's electrocardiogram was altered, and the woman's was normal.
- Serum digoxin levels, measured on a Roche COBAS Integra 800 with the Roche On-Line
  Digoxin reagent, were 1.14 and 1.00 nmol/L, respectively.
- Potassium levels were normal in both patients.
- The serum digoxin concentration decreased on the second day, and symptoms resolved
  on the third day with patients fully recovered (i.e., reversion to a normal sinus
  rhythm).
- Cardiac-glycoside-like intoxication symptoms follow the ingestion of leaves or flowers
  of Nerium oleander.
- The consumed snails were suspected to be responsible for the intoxication.
- In the homogenized snail tissue, the concentration expressed in digoxin equivalents
  was 0.282 nmol/g.
- The presence of oleandrin and oleandrigenin in the snails was confirmed by liquid
  chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis, which was performed on a ionic-trap
  Finnigan LXQ instrument using an electrospray ionization interface.
- High-pressure liquid chromatographic separation was performed on a C18 column with
  a gradient of methanol/water.
- An extract of oleander leaves was used as reference.
