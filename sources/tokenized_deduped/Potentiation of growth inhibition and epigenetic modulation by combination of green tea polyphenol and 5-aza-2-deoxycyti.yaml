- Epigenetic therapy by DNA demethylating agent 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (5-aza 2′dC)
  is clinically effective in acute myeloid leukemia; however, it has shown limited
  results in treatment of breast cancer and has significant toxicity to normal cells.
- Green tea polyphenol (−)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) has anti-cancer and DNA
  demethylating properties with no significant toxicity toward normal cells.
- Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy
  of a combination of non-toxic, low dose of 5-aza 2′ dC with EGCG, on growth inhibition
  of breast cancer cells.
- Human breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7, MDA-MB 231) and non-tumorigenic MCF-10A breast
  epithelial cells were treated with either 5-aza 2′ dC, EGCG, or their combination
  for 7 days.
- Cell growth inhibition was determined by cell count, cell viability, cell cycle,
  and soft agar assay, whereas genes expression changes were determined by quantitative
  real-time PCR and/or Western blot analysis.
- Histone modifications and global DNA methylation changes were determined by Western
  blot and RAPD-PCR, respectively.
- The results revealed significantly greater inhibition of growth of breast cancer
  cells by co-treatment with 5-aza 2′ dC and EGCG compared to individual treatments,
  whereas it has no significant toxicity to MCF-10A cells.
- This was further confirmed by gene expression analysis.
- Changes in DNA methylation and histone modifications were also greater in cells
  with combination treatment.
- Findings of this study suggest that potentiation of growth inhibition of breast
  cancer cells by 5-aza 2′ dC and EGCG combination treatment, at least in part, is
  mediated by epigenetic mechanism.
- Breast cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer among women in the United
  States [1].
- Although tremendous progress has been made in breast cancer treatment, it is often
  hindered by de novo or acquired drug resistance [2, 3].
- Current chemotherapeutic drugs used in breast cancer mainly encompass anthracyclines,
  taxanes, and platinum-based drugs.
- However, in addition to cancerous cells, these drugs can also kill normal cells
  and have adverse side effects like cardio-toxicity, neutropenia, neurotoxicity,
  muscle fatigue, and abnormal blood clotting [4–6].
- The inadequate clinical response and toxicity of anti-cancer drugs to normal cells
  [7] suggest a need for alternate targets and treatment strategies for breast cancer.
- Accumulating evidence suggests that in addition to the genetic alterations, the
  epigenetic changes play an important role in breast cancer development.
- Global DNA methylation, concurrent with loci-specific hypermethylation is a common
  hallmark of breast cancer [8].
- Global hypomethylation is linked to chromosomal instability and activation of oncogenes,
  whereas loci-specific hypermethylation leads to transcriptional silencing of tumor
  suppressor genes.
- For example, genes involved in pathways including cell cycle regulation (_cyclin
  D2_, _p16INK4a_, _14_-_3_-_3σ_), DNA repair (_MGMT_, _hMLH1_, _BRCA1_), growth inhibitory
  signaling (_RARß_, _RASSF1A_, _HIN1_, _SFRP1_), cell adhesion (_CDH1_), angiogenesis
  (_maspin_), carcinogen detoxification (_GSTP1_), hormone regulation (_ERα_, _PR_),
  and apoptosis (_TWIST_, _HOXA5_, _DAPK1_) are silenced by promoter hypermethylation
  in breast cancer [9, 10].
- In contrast to genetic changes like mutations that are non-reversible, epigenetic
  changes can be reversed and therefore epigenetically silenced genes in cancer can
  be reactivated.
- It is because of this reversible nature of epigenetic alterations in target molecules,
  a new strategy known as “epigenetic therapy” has recently emerged for cancer therapy
  [11].
- Epigenetic alterations can also serve as biomarkers of cancer risk.
- A recent study has associated methylation of ATM gene in white blood cells with
  breast cancer risk [12].
- Decitabine or 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (5-aza 2′ dC) is a nucleoside analog and well-established
  DNA demethylating agent.
- Evidence suggests that 5-aza 2′dC demethylates DNA by various mechanisms, such as
  inhibiting the activity of DNA methyltransferase enzyme [13] and degradation of
  DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) by ubiquitination-dependent proteasomal pathway
  [14].
- Pharmacological action of 5-aza 2′ dC is mediated by its incorporation into DNA,
  leading to formation of irresolvable DNA-5-aza 2′ dC complex.
- Interestingly, 5-aza 2′ dC acts as demethylating agent only at low doses, and higher
  doses of this drug cause cell death due to cytotoxicity [15].
- Doses of 5-aza 2′ dC that are currently used in the clinic have shown limited results
  in solid tumors when given as a single agent, and higher doses cause cytotoxicity
  to normal cells [16].
- To overcome this limitation of 5aza-2′dC for its clinical use as a chemotherapeutic
  agent, it has been suggested that combination of epigenetic modifiers may be more
  successful in DNA demethylation-mediated re-expression of silenced genes in breast
  cancer [15].
- (−)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) is the major catechin among the polyphenols
  in green tea (_Camellia sinensis_) [17].
- Evidence suggests that EGCG can inhibit the growth of breast cancer cells in vitro
  and breast tumor in vivo [18].
- It has been reported that EGCG can induce cancer cell-specific apoptosis and cell
  cycle arrest and has no or minimal toxicity toward normal cells [19].
- Mechanistically, EGCG inhibits breast cancer growth by interfering with multiple
  signaling pathways including NF-κB, MAPK, and EGFR [20].
- Additionally, EGCG is an epigenetic modifier, which can re-express epigenetically
  silenced tumor suppressor genes such as _RARß_, _hMLH1_, _GSTP1_, and _p16_ _INK4a_
  by downregulation of DNA methyltransferase and histone deacetylase activity in cancer
  cells [21–24].
- Treatment of human prostate cancer LNCaP cells with green tea polyphenols causes
  time-dependent inhibition of HDACs 1, 2, and 3 expressions and upregulation of histone
  acetylation [25].
- As EGCG selectively kills cancer cells and has shown great promise in growth inhibition
  of cancer cells, it presents a high potential for development as an effective and
  minimally cytotoxic cancer therapeutic.
- However, the concentrations of EGCG used in vitro studies for growth inhibition
  are unachievable through daily intake of tea in patients [26], thus limiting its
  potential as a monotherapeutic agent in cancer.
- While chemotherapeutic or epigenetic drugs have been used in combination with EGCG
  or 5-aza 2′ dC so as to synergize tumor suppression or sensitize cancer cells, the
  potential of combination treatment of 5-aza 2′ dC and EGCG on growth inhibition
  of breast cancer cells is not known.
- Both compounds are established DNA methyltransferase inhibitors, therefore their
  combination may have greater effect on re-expression of genes that are silenced
  by promoter hypermethylation in breast cancer.
- In addition to the tumor growth suppression by restoration of epigenetically silenced
  tumor suppressor genes, EGCG-mediated cell cycle arrest and apoptosis through targeting
  cell signaling pathways can further add to inhibition of breast cancer growth.
- This suggests that extended co-treatment with non-toxic, low doses of 5-aza 2′ dC
  and EGCG may potentiate growth inhibition of breast cancer through synergistically
  reactivating tumor suppressors as well as drug-specific mechanisms, while minimizing
  cytotoxicity to normal cells.
- Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of 5-aza 2′
  dC and EGCG co-treatment, at low concentrations as compared to their individual
  treatment on growth inhibition of breast cancer cells in vitro.
- 5-Aza-2′-deoxycytidine (5-aza 2′ dC), (−)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), and
  dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO).
- TRizol for RNA isolation was purchased from Invitrogen, Inc. (Carlsbad, CA).
- Human breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 [ER positive] and MDA-MB 231 [ER negative]
  as well as the human normal breast epithelial cell line MCF 10A were obtained from
  American Type Culture Collection (ATCC).
- MCF 10A is a non-tumorigenic human breast epithelial cell line and has been a widely
  accepted model for normal breast epithelium [27, 28].
- MCF 10A cells were maintained in MEBM mammary epithelial cell growth media.
- MCF-7 and MDA-MB 231 cells were propagated in Dulbecco’s modified eagle minimal
  medium (DMEM F12) supplemented with 5 % fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1 % antibiotic–antimycotic
  solution.
- Cell culture of all the three cell lines were maintained at 37 °C in a 5 % CO2-containing
  humidified incubator.
- Cells were treated with either 5-aza 2′ dC (5 µM), EGCG (50 µM), combination of
  EGCG and 5-aza 2′ dC or DMSO (0.001 %) as vehicle control for 7 days.
- Stock solutions for treatment were made in DMSO and diluted prior to use.
- Treatments were given in cell culture media specific for each cell line.
- Media were changed, and fresh treatment was given after every 48 h. All the three
  cell lines were used to evaluate the effect of treatments on cell growth.
- Since the observed effects of treatment on growth were greater in MCF-7 cells than
  MDA-MB231, only MCF-7 cells were used for subsequent molecular and mechanistic analysis.
- Cell count analysis was performed to assess the effects of 5-aza 2′ dC, EGCG, and
  their combination on the growth inhibition of MCF10A, MCF-7, and MDA-MB 231 cells.
- Briefly, 100,000 cells were seeded in 6-well plates.
- After 24 h of seeding, cells were treated with either 5-aza 2′ dC (5 µM), EGCG (50
  µM), combination of EGCG and 5-aza 2′ dC or DMSO (vehicle control) for 7 days.
- Treatments were given in cell culture media specific for each cell lines.
- Media were changed, and fresh treatment was given after every 48 h. At day 7, cells
  were detached by trypsinization and suspended in cell culture media, and viable
  cells were counted with a Nexcelom Cellometer cell counter.
- Each treatment was run in triplicates and the experiment was repeated twice.
- Methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay was performed to determine the effects
  of EGCG and 5-aza2′dC treatments on cell viability.
- Cells were seeded in triplicates in 96-well plates at a density of 2,500 cells per
  well.
- After 24 h of seeding, cells were treated with 5-aza2′dC, EGCG, and their combination
  as mentioned above.
- Media were changed, and fresh treatment was given after every 48 h. MTT assay was
  performed at day 7 of the treatment.
- Briefly, media were removed, cells were washed with 1X PBS, fresh culture media
  with MTT (1 mg/mL final concentration in media) were added to each well, and the
  plate was incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. Media were removed, and formazan was solubilized
  by adding 200 μL of DMSO in each well.
- The optical density (OD) was measured at 570 and 650 nm (as background).
- Each treatment was run in triplicates and the experiment was repeated twice.
- Cell viability was converted into percentage with respect to control as 100 %.
- Cells were seeded in 25-cm2 flasks and treated as mentioned earlier.
- The optimum cell seeding density was chosen so as to maintain sub-confluency at
  the time of cell fixation.
- After 7 days of treatment, cells were fixed in 70 % cold ethanol and stored at 4
  °C for 24 h. Fixed cells were stained with Guava® Cell Cycle Reagent (Millipore,
  CA, USA), and cell cycle analysis was performed using Guava EasyCyteTM flow cytometer
  (Millipore, CA,USA) as per manufacturer’s instructions.
- A total of 5,000 gated events were counted and data were acquired for each sample
  by Guava Incyte software (Millipore, CA).
- Each treatment was run in triplicates and the experiment was repeated twice.
- Anchorage-independent growth of MCF-7 cells was determined by soft agar assay.
- Briefly, a base layer of agar (0.5 %) in cell culture media was plated in six-well
  plates.
- MCF-7 cells were treated as mentioned earlier for 72 h, mixed in top layer agar
  solution (0.35 %) and then plated at a density of 5,000 cells per well.
- Each treatment group was plated in triplicates.
- Plates were incubated at 37 °C in a 5 % CO2-containing humidified incubator.
- After plating, cells were treated with different drug regimes as mentioned previously
  after every 48 h. After 7 days of colony growth, cells were stained with 0.001 %
  crystal violet dye, and colonies were visualized and counted under a microscope.
- Total RNA was isolated from control and treated MCF-7 cells by TRIzol method and
  one-step real-time PCR kit with SYBR green dye (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules,
  CA) was used for amplification of total RNA (50 ng) as per manufacturer’s instructions.
- 'Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) amplifications were performed in 96-well reaction
  plates using MyiQ2 real-time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules,
  CA) with the following PCR amplification conditions: Reverse transcription at 50
  °C for 10 min, RT enzyme inactivation at 95 °C for 5 min, followed by 40 cycles
  each of 10 s denaturation at 95 °C and 30 s annealing and extension at 60 °C.'
- Specificity of the PCR products was verified by melt curve analysis.
- Threshold cycle number (Ct value) was determined using iCycler IQ2 optical system
  software (Bio-Rad version 3.0a).
- The Ct value of each gene of interest was normalized to Ct value of GAPDH, and fold
  change in the gene expression was calculated using the delta–delta Ct method [29].
- Amplification reaction for each treatment was performed in triplicates, and the
  experiment was repeated twice.
- A non-template control was included in each experiment.
- Primer sequences used for qRT-PCR are given in Table 1.
- "Sequences of forward and reverse primers used in analysis of gene expression by
  real-time PCR  \n\n\n\n\nMethylation-sensitive random amplification of polymorphic
  DNA was carried out to study the effect of treatment on DNA methylation patterns
  [30]."
- MS-RAPD is based on digestion of DNA by isoschizomeric restriction enzymes, methylation
  sensitive (MspI) and methylation insensitive (HpaII).
- Both the enzymes recognize CCGG; however, Hpa II is unable to cut when internal
  cytosine residue is methylated, whereas MspI can cleave with internal cytosine methylated,
  and therefore can discriminate between methylated and unmethylated cytosine.
- Total DNA was extracted from treated and control MCF-7 cells by SDS/proteinase K
  digestion and phenol–chloroform extraction method as described before [31].
- DNA was quantified spectrophotometrically, and quality was verified by agarose gel
  electrophoresis.
- 2.5 µg of DNA was used for single digestion with HpaII and MspI at 37 °C overnight.
- RAPD-PCR was performed using digested and undigested DNA with random 10-mer primers.
- Reaction was carried out in a 25-µL reaction mixture containing 100 µM dNTPs (Applied
  Biosystems, Foster City, CA), 100 nM primer, 0.5 U AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (Applied
  Biosystems, Foster City, CA), 2.5 µL enzyme assay buffer, 2.5 mM MgCl2, and 75 ng
  DNA.
- 'The PCR amplifications were performed in a DNA thermal cycler (GeneAmp PCR System
  2700) programmed for 45 cycles as follows: one cycle of 3.5 min at 92 °C, 1 min
  at 34 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C followed by 44 cycles of 1 min at 92 °C, 1 min at 34
  °C and 2 min at 72 °C, followed by a final extension cycle of 15 min at 72 °C.'
- PCR products were resolved on 1.5 % agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide
  staining.
- Protein lysates were prepared from 7-day treated and control MCF-7 cells and resolved
  by SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis.
- After electrophoretic separation, the protein bands were transferred to a nitrocellulose
  membrane.
- The membrane was blocked with 5 % non-fat milk solution (non-fat dried milk in 1X
  TBS) for an hour at room temperature and then incubated with primary antibody overnight
  at 4 °C.
- 'Dilutions of antibodies used are as follows: _GAPDH_ 1:200 (Santa Cruz, Cat# sc-25778),
  _DNMT1_ 1:100 (Santa Cruz, Cat# 10219), _H3K27me3_ 1:200 (Millipore, Cat#17-622),
  _MBD4_ 1:100 (Santa Cruz, Cat# sc-10754), _HDAC1_ 1:100 (Santa Cruz, Cat# sc-6298),
  _p_-_Ac_-_H3 (Ser11/K15)_ 1:200 (Santa Cruz, Cat#33361).'
- After incubation, membranes were given three washes, each of 10 min with 1X TBST
  washing buffer (1X TBS containing 0.05 % tween 20) and then incubated with appropriate
  horseradish peroxidase conjugated secondary antibodies at 1:1,000 (anti-rabbit),
  1:500 (anti-goat and anti-mouse) dilutions for an hour at room temperature.
- Membranes were washed three times, each for 10 min with 1X TBST buffer.
- Protein bands were visualized with chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham,
  NJ).
- Band intensity was quantified with ImageJ software.
- Intensity value for protein of interest was normalized to GAPDH and plotted as histogram.
- Student’s _t_ test (independent-two sample, unequal variance) was performed to determine
  the significant difference between treatments.
- Values with _p_ &lt; 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.
- To determine the effect of 5-aza 2′ dC, EGCG, and their co-treatment on breast cancer
  cell growth in vitro, cell count analysis and MTT assay were performed after treating
  cells for 7 days.
- The results of cell count analysis and MTT assay are given in Fig.
- 1
- Treatment with 5-aza 2′ dC alone resulted in statistically significant (_p_ &lt;
  0.05) growth inhibition of both MCF-7 and MDA-MB231 cells by 22.7 and 23.4 percent,
  respectively, as compared to vehicle-treated control cells (Fig.
- 1a).
- Treatment with EGCG alone significantly inhibited the growth of MCF-7 cells by 23.5
  percent, whereas growth inhibition of MDA-MB 231 cells by 18.5 % was statistically
  not significant.
- The combination of 5-aza 2′ dC and EGCG, however, significantly inhibited the growth
  of both MCF-7 and MDA-MB 231 cells by 46.5 and 39.5 percent, respectively, thereby
  suggesting a synergistic effect of co-treatment on growth inhibition of these breast
  cancer cells.
- There was no significant growth inhibition of MCF-10A cells after treatment with
  5-aza 2′ dC and EGCG both alone and in combination.
- _Bar graph_ representation of the effect of 5-aza 2′ dC (5 µM), EGCG (50 µM), and

  231 cells as measured by cell count analysis (Fig.
- 1a) and cell viability by MTT assay (Fig.
- 1b).
- Cells were treated with 5-aza 2′ dC (5 µM), EGCG (50 µM), 5-aza 2′ dC, and EGCG
  combination or vehicle (DMSO) control for 7 days, and cell count analysis and MTT
  assay were performed as described in Materials and Methods.
- Average value of cell counts and MTT assay from each treatment group was converted
  into percentage with vehicle control as 100 % and bar graph was plotted.
- An _asterisk_ indicates statistically significant difference as compared to vehicle
  control (DMSO).
- Symbol _hash_ indicates significant difference as compared to corresponding concentration
  of 5-aza 2′ dC.
- 'Symbol _infinity_ indicates significant difference as compared to corresponding
  concentration of EGCG


  To further validate the result of cell count, MTT assay for cell viability was also
  performed.'
- The result of MTT assay revealed that treatment of MCF-7 cells with 5-aza 2′ dC
  and EGCG alone for 7 days caused significant decrease in their viability by 23.57
  and 27.08 %, respectively, as compared to the vehicle-treated control cells (Fig.
- 1b).
- The combination of 5-aza 2′ dC and EGCG, however, resulted in greater decrease in
  MCF-7 cell viability by 45.12 % as compared to cells treated with either 5-aza 2′
  dC or EGCG alone.
- Similarly, treatment with 5-aza 2′ dC and EGCG both alone resulted in 42.01 and
  37.26 % decrease in viability of MDA-MB 231 cells, whereas their combination resulted
  in even greater decrease by 51.4 % in this cell line (Fig.
- 1b).
- Decreases in viability of MCF-7 and MDA-MB231 cells treated with 5-aza 2′ dC and
  EGCG combination were statistically significant as compared to both vehicle-treated
  control cells and cells treated individually with either of these two compounds.
- There was no significant change in the viability of MCF-10A cells treated with either
  5-aza 2′ dC or EGCG alone as well as their combination.
- Therefore, the MTT data further confirmed the potentiation of growth inhibition
  in these two breast cancer cell lines by combination of 5-aza 2′ dC and EGCG as
  compared to cells treated alone with either of these two compounds.
- Cell cycle analysis was performed to determine whether EGCG and 5-aza 2′ dC decrease
  the growth of MCF-7 and MDA-MB 231 cells by induction of apoptosis and/or delayed
  cell cycle progression.
- The flow cytometry histograms are given in Fig.
- 2a, and the percentage of cells in pre-G1 is given as bar graph in Fig.
- 2b.
- As compared to vehicle control, an increase in pre-G1 sub-population (apoptotic
  cells) was observed in all the treated groups of both MCF-7 and MDA-MB 231 cells
  (Fig.
- 2a, b).
- Interestingly, the percentage of pre-G1 cell population was significantly higher
  in cells treated with the combination of EGCG and 5-aza 2′ dC than cells treated
  individually with either EGCG or 5-aza 2′ dC.
- For example, treatment of MCF-7 cells with 5-aza 2′ dC and EGCG alone resulted in
  15.8 and 21.2 percent cells, respectively, in pre-G1, whereas cells co-treated with
  5-aza 2′ dC and EGCG had 30.5 percent cells in pre-G1.
- Similarly, MDA-MB 231 cells treated with 5-aza 2′ dC and EGCG alone had 7.3 and
  16.9 percent cells, respectively, in pre-G1, whereas their combination resulted
  in 24.2 percent cells in pre-G1.
- As compared to MCF-7 and MDA-MB 231 cells, the percentage of pre-G1 cells in MCF-10A
  was extremely low in both 5-aza 2′ dC and EGCG alone and their combination treatment
  groups.
- Treatment of MCF-10A cells with 5-aza 2′ dC and EGCG alone resulted in 0.1 and 0.6
  percent cells, respectively, in pre-G1, whereas cells co-treated with 5-aza 2′ dC
  and EGCG had 1.5 percent cells in pre-G1.
- Therefore, the cell cycle data suggest that apoptosis may be one of the mechanisms
  through which co-treatment of 5-aza 2′ dC and EGCG potentiates the growth inhibition
  of breast cancer cells but had no adverse effect on the growth of normal breast
  epithelial cells.

  Soft agar colony formation assay was performed in order to determine the effect
  of 5-aza 2′ dC and EGCG on the colony formation of MCF-7 cells.'
- The result of soft agar assay showed that both, 5-aza 2′ dC and EGCG, as well as
  their combination significantly reduced the anchorage-independent growth of MCF-7
  cells (Fig.
- 3).
- As compared to control, there was a significant reduction in the number of soft
  agar grown colonies by 47.5, 58.4, and 90.5 % in 5-aza 2′ dC, EGCG, and combination
  treatment, respectively.
- In addition to the decreased number of colonies, decrease in the size of colonies
  was also observed in all the treatment groups as compared to vehicle control.
- The combination treatment resulted in the maximum reduction in number as well as
  in size of colonies.
- Thus, the data of soft agar assay suggest that co-treatment resulted not only in
  greater reduction of breast cancer cell growth but also anchorage-independent growth,
  an indicator of cell tumorigenic potential, of MCF-7 cells as compared to control
  and individual treatments.

  7 days.

  methods section.

  To further understand the growth inhibitory effect of 5-aza 2′ dC, EGCG, and their
  co-treatment at molecular level, the expression of genes involved in cell cycle,
  apoptosis, tumor suppression, and proliferation of breast cancer cells was analyzed
  at transcript level by quantitative real-time PCR.'
- 'The changes in the expression of each category of genes are as follows:




  The representative genes for cell cycle (_CCND1_, _CCNE2_, _CCNA1_, _CCNG1_, _CCNG2_),
  cell survival (_Bcl2_, _Bax_ and _survivin_), and growth signaling (_Wnt1_, _RASSF1A_)
  were analyzed (Fig.'
- 4).
- Among the cell cycle-related genes, the expression of _CCNE2_ and _CCNA1_ was significantly
  downregulated in all the treatment groups as compared to control.
- Although there was no significant change in the G1 cyclin _CCND1_ in 5-aza 2′ dC-treated
  cells, its expression was significantly downregulated in EGCG-treated cells.
- Co-treatment of 5-aza 2′ dC and EGCG leads to significantly greater downregulation
  in _CCND1_ expression (0.108-fold change) as compared to individual treatments.
- Similarly, co-treatment leads to significantly greater downregulation of another
  G1 cyclin, _CCNE2_ (0.09-fold change) as compared to the treatment with 5-aza 2′
  dC (0.279-fold change) and EGCG (0.52-fold change) alone.
- Decreased expression of _CCNA1_ was also observed in all the treated groups, however,
  co-treatment did not lead to greater decrease as compared to individual treatments.
- The expression of _CCNG1_ was significantly downregulated in 5-aza 2′ dC-treated
  cells (0.689-fold change) as well as cells co-treated with 5-aza 2′ dC and EGCG
  (0.71-fold change), but not in those treated with EGCG (1.27-fold change) alone.
- The expression of another negative cell cycle regulatory gene, cyclin _CCNG2_ was
  significantly upregulated in EGCG-treated (2.99-fold change) and co-treated cells
  (1.65-fold change).
- However, no significant difference was observed in the expression of _CCNG2_ in
  5-aza 2′ dC-treated cells (1.19-fold change) as compared to control.
- The expression of pro-apoptotic gene, _Bax_ was significantly increased in all the
  treated cells as compared to control, however, the expression of _Bax_ in co-treated
  cells (2.69-fold change) was significantly increased as compared to 5-aza 2′ dC
  (2.12-fold change) but not EGCG (2.59-fold change).
- The expression of anti-apoptotic gene, _Bcl2_ was significantly downregulated in
  5-aza 2′ dC and EGCG-treated cells.
- Co-treated cells had significantly more downregulation in _Bcl2_ (0.179-fold change)
  as compared to cells treated with either 5-aza 2′ dC (0.488-fold change) or EGCG
  (0.248-fold change).
- Maximum alteration of _Bax:_ _Bcl2_ ratio, in favor of apoptosis (_Bax:Bcl2_ &gt;

  cells treated with either 5-aza 2′ dC(_Bax:Bcl2_ = 4.34) and EGCG (_Bax:Bcl2_ =
  10.44).
- Similar trend of downregulation of pro-survival genes, _Survivin_ and _Wnt1_, was
  also observed.
- Significantly greater downregulation of _Wnt1_ was observed in co-treated cells

  change) or EGCG (0.546-fold change).
- Expression of _RASSF1A_ gene, known to have tumor suppressor properties was significantly

  To evaluate the role of epigenetic mechanism on the growth inhibitory effect of
  5-aza 2′ dC and EGCG, the expression of genes involved in DNA methylation (_DNMT1_,
  _DNMT3a_, and _DNMT3b_), histone deacetylation (_HDAC1_), and methylated DNA recognition
  (_MBD4_) was analyzed by real-time PCR (Fig.'
- 5).
- The expression of the three DNMTs (_DNMT1_, _DNMT3a_, and _DNMT3b_) analyzed in
  this study was decreased in all treatments.
- Cells co-treated with EGCG and 5-aza 2′ dC had significantly greater downregulation
  in _DNMT1_ and _DNMT3b_ transcripts expression as compared to that in cells treated
  with either 5-aza 2′ dC or EGCG.
- A similar trend of maximum decrease in co-treated cells was not observed for _DNMT3a_.
- Expression of methyl-binding domain protein _MBD4_ was significantly downregulated
  by both EGCG and co-treatment, though no significant difference was seen between
  the two.
- No significant change in _MBD4_ was observed in 5-aza 2′ dC-treated cells.
- Although there was a decrease in expression of _HDAC1_ in co-treated and EGCG-treated
  cells, it was statistically not significant.

  Western blot analysis was performed to further confirm the changes in the expression
  of some of the epigenetic regulatory genes (DNMT1, HDAC1, and MBD4) at protein level.'
- The level of histone H3 modifications (H3K27me3 and p-Ac-H3 (S11/K15)) was also
  measured at protein level.
- The result (Fig.
- 6) revealed that the expression of HDAC1, DNMT1, and MBD4 was significantly downregulated
  in cells treated with either 5-aza 2′ dC, EGCG, or their co-treatment.
- As compared to cells treated with either 5-aza 2′ dC or EGCG, co-treated cells had
  significantly greater downregulation of HDAC1 and MBD4.
- Interestingly, the expression of DNMT1 was undetectable in 5-aza 2′ dC-treated cells,
  and co-treatment of 5-aza 2′ dC and EGCG leads to significantly greater downregulation
  of DNMT1 as compared to EGCG alone.
- Co-treated cells had significantly greater decrease in methylated H3 (H3K27me3)
  when compared to 5-aza 2′ dC and vehicle control-treated cells, but not in EGCG-treated
  cells.
- The level of histone H3 acetylation (p-Ac-H3 (S11/K15)) was significantly decreased
  in co-treated cells as compared to vehicle control and cells treated with either
  5-aza 2′ dC or EGCG.

  The effect of 5-aza 2′ dC and EGCG treatments on genome-wide methylation pattern
  was evaluated by methylation-sensitive RAPD-PCR.'
- As compared to control, there was no change in the RAPD fingerprint generated from
  undigested DNA (Fig.
- 7).
- This indicates the absence of mutational changes due to 5-aza 2′ dC and EGCG treatment.
- As compared to undigested DNA, the methylation-sensitive (MS) RAPD-PCR from restriction-digested
  DNA revealed several changes in RAPD fingerprint.
- Comparison of DNA fingerprint generated from MspI-digested DNA revealed the presence
  of 500 and 300 bp bands in treated cells, whereas the intensity of these two bands
  was faint/hardly detectable in vehicle control, thereby suggesting that hypomethylation
  was induced at these loci by 5-aza 2′ dC and EGCG.
- This was further confirmed by the presence of these bands in control and their loss
  in intensity in the treated group of cells from Hpa II-digested RAPD fingerprint.
- Similar pattern of 5-aza 2′ dC- and EGCG-induced hypomethylation was observed in
  RAPD fingerprint generated from additional set of primers (data not shown).
- Representative MS-RAPD fingerprint generated using the total DNA from cells treated
  with 5-aza 2′ dC (5 µM), EGCG (50 µM), EGCG, and 5-aza 2′ dC combination and DMSO
  as vehicle control for 7 days.
- Total DNA was digested with MspI and Hpa II restriction enzymes, and MS-RAPD-PCR
  was performed as described in Materials and Methods.
- Random primer sequence used to generate the RAPD fingerprint is 5′-AAAGCTGCGG- 3′.
- 'Treatments are represented as follows: _M_ Marker; _1_ DMSO; _2_ 5-aza 2′ dC (5
  µM); _3_ EGCG (50 µM); _4_ EGCG (50 µM) and 5-aza 2′ dC (5 µM).'

  The major finding of this study is that co-treatment with non-toxic, low concentrations
  of 5-aza 2′ dC and EGCG is more efficient in inhibiting growth of breast cancer
  cells as compared to individual treatments.'
- Additionally, for the first time our data revealed that this potentiation of growth
  inhibition by co-treatment is, at least in part, mediated by their synergistic action
  on epigenetic modulators in breast cancer cells.
- Both 5-aza 2′ dC and EGCG inhibit growth of cancer cells by several mechanisms including
  apoptosis and cell cycle arrest.
- 5-aza 2′ dC induces G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis by altering expression
  of cyclins and aberrantly methylated apoptotic genes [32–37].
- Similarly, EGCG can regulate the expression of cell cycle regulatory and apoptotic
  genes to decrease cancer cell growth and proliferation by inducing cell cycle arrest
  and apoptosis [38–41].
- EGCG has been shown to inhibit the growth of cancer cells by regulating the cell
  surface growth factor receptors, such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR),
  vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), insulin-like growth factor
  receptor (IGFR) involved in receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)-dependent signaling pathways
  for cell proliferation, survival, and angiogenesis [42–44].
- Another mechanism for EGCG—mediated growth inhibition of cancer cells involve inhibition
  of various transcription factors that are frequently upregulated in cancer cells,
  such as STAT1, STAT3, AP-1, NF-kB, Sp1, and FOXO1 [45–48].
- These reports suggest that both EGCG and 5-aza′dC have potential to inhibit growth
  of cancer cells by these two agent-specific mechanisms as described above.
- However, the efficacy of 5-aza′dC and EGCG is limited in solid tumors when given
  as single agent [26, 49].
- It has been suggested that these compounds can be combined with other chemotherapeutic
  drugs or HDAC inhibitors to augment their effects [15, 50].
- Therefore, in this study, we further investigated the mechanisms through which co-treatment
  of 5-aza 2′ dC and EGCG resulted in greater growth inhibition of breast cancer cells.
- Significantly, greater downregulation of _cyclin D1_, _cyclin E2_, and _Bcl2_ mRNA
  in MCF-7 cells co-treated with EGCG and 5-aza 2′ dC as compared to those treated
  with either compound alone suggests that these genes are the common target for these
  two compounds.
- Additionally, we also observed drug-specific changes in the expression of certain
  genes, such as _cyclin G1_, _cyclin G2_, and _cyclin A1_, thereby suggesting that
  these genes are uniquely targeted by either 5-aza′dC or EGCG.
- Therefore, the observed potentiation in growth inhibition by co-treatment may be
  due to alteration of common as well as drug-specific targets, which otherwise may
  not be possible to achieve by single-agent treatment.
- In addition to these above-mentioned genetic targets, studies have shown that both
  5-aza 2′ dC and EGCG are epigenetic modifiers and inhibit DNMTs [13, 22].
- Additionally, EGCG has HDAC inhibitory activity [24].
- Elevated levels of class 1 HDAC enzymes in breast cancer tissue suggest their role
  in breast cancer development [51].
- EGCG reduces the expression of HDAC 3 not only at transcript level but also by targeting
  this protein for degradation in HCT 116 cancer cells [52].
- These reports suggest that both EGCG and 5-aza 2′ dC can synergistically act through
  epigenetic mechanism.
- Consistent with this theory, many genes including _RASSF1A_, _Wnt1, CCND1, CCNA1,
  Bax_, and _survivin_, that were synergistically either up or downregulated by co-treatment
  in our study, are known to be regulated by epigenetic mechanisms [34, 53, 54].
- Therefore, the epigenetic effect of EGCG and 5-aza 2′ dC was also examined in this
  study.
- Our data indicate that co-treatment of EGCG and 5-aza 2′ dC can synergistically
  target several epigenetic regulatory genes.
- For example, significantly greater downregulation of _DNMT1_, _DNMT 3b_ transcripts,
  and HDAC1 and MBD4 proteins was observed in co-treated cells as compared to individually
  treated cells.
- Besides the change in expression of epigenetic regulatory genes, co-treatment also
  resulted in greater effects on DNA methylation and histone modifications as compared
  to the individual treatments.
- For example, methylation-sensitive RAPD results revealed increase in DNA hypomethylation
  in co-treated MCF-7 cells.
- Similarly, co-treatment resulted in decrease in histone H3K27 trimethylation and
  histone H3 acetylation (p-Ac-H3 (S11/K15)).
- The antibody used in this study for histone acetylation detects both phosphorylation
  of serine 11 and acetylation at lysine 15.
- Phosphorylation of serine 11 facilitates acetylation of H3 and is associated with
  mitogen-activated c-fos oncogene expression in a MAP kinase-dependent manner [55,
  56].
- The observed decrease in p-Ac-H3 (S11/K15) by co-treatment of EGCG and 5-aza 2′
  dC suggests that these two compounds mediate growth inhibition by p-Ac-H3 (S11/K15)-dependent
  inactivation of oncogenes in MCF-7 breast cancer cells.
- Given the role of these epigenetic regulatory proteins and histone modifications
  in repression of critical genes such as tumor suppressors and DNA repair genes in
  cancer [57–61], the data of this study suggest that the observed potentiation of
  growth inhibition by co-treatment is, at least in part, mediated by epigenetic mechanisms,
  such as epigenetic reactivation of tumor suppressors and apoptotic pathways in breast
  cancer cells.
- An important aspect of this study was the dose of 5-aza 2′ dC and EGCG selected
  for treatment.
- 5-aza 2′ dC has a dual dose-dependent mechanism of action.
- High dose of 5-aza 2′ dC leads to formation of cytotoxic DNA adducts, whereas low
  dose induces gene expression changes that favor reduced proliferation and apoptosis
  [15].
- EGCG has been reported to induce apoptosis in several cancer cell lines without
  affecting the normal cells [62–64].
- The result of this study from cell count, MTT assay for cell viability, and cell
  cycle analysis further confirmed that low dose 5-aza 2′ dC and EGCG alone or their
  combination has no cytotoxic effect on MCF-10A normal breast epithelial cells, whereas
  these two compounds induce significant cytotoxicity to MCF-7 and MDA-MB 231 breast
  cancer cells.
- While the exact mechanism for this differential action is not known, pro-oxidative
  effect of EGCG has been attributed for its cancer cell-specific apoptosis.
- Studies have shown that, in general, normal cells have a better anti-oxidant system
  as compared to cancer cells, where the anti-oxidant system integrity is compromised
  [65, 66], therefore normal cells are better suited to scavenge H2O2 produced by
  EGCG than cancer cells [19, 67–69].
- This may be a potential reason for the cancer cell specificity of EGCG for inducing
  apoptosis.
- It is interesting to note that EGCG can induce apoptosis or necrosis based on its
  dose.
- Lower concentrations (10–50) µM of EGCG have been reported to favor apoptosis, whereas
  higher concentrations (100–400 µM) are associated with necrosis in MCF-7 cells.
- This dose-dependent effect has been attributed to apoptosis favoring changes in
  intracellular ROS, mitochondrial membrane potential, and ATP levels, which are induced
  by lower dose of EGCG [70].
- These previous reports and the result of this study suggests that cancer cell-specific
  cytotoxicity can be achieved by a combination of these two compounds at concentrations
  low enough to be safe for normal cells.
- Recent evidence suggests that combination of chemotherapeutic or naturally occurring
  compounds has advantages over single-agent treatments.
- For example, combination of EGCG with chemotherapeutic drugs such as tamoxifen or
  dietary phytochemicals like resveratrol can synergistically inhibit proliferation
  of breast cancer cells [71, 72].
- Similarly, 5-aza 2′ dC can be combined with HDAC inhibitors to synergistically decrease
  cancer cell proliferation and growth [73, 74].
- Due to the reversible nature of epigenetic targets and the minimal toxicity of bioactive
  dietary compounds toward normal cells unlike conventional chemotherapeutic drugs,
  combination of EGCG and 5-aza 2′ dC has great promise for clinical applications
  in breast cancer treatment.
- Therefore, these previous reports and the findings of this study further highlight
  the importance of combination treatment for efficient inhibition of cancer growth.
- In summary, our data suggest that combination of 5-aza′dC and EGCG is more effective
  in terms of breast cancer cell growth inhibition as compared to individual treatments.
- Our study indicates that the combination of 5-aza 2′ dC with green tea polyphenol
  EGCG can target cancer growth and proliferation by multiple mechanisms including
  modification of epigenetic machinery.
