- Vitamin D and calcium have been shown to have protective effects against breast
  cancer development in animal studies.
- Vitamin D and calcium play important anticarcinogenic roles in animal studies.
- Exposures between menarche and first birth may be important in breast development
  and future breast cancer risk.
- However, the relations between adolescent vitamin D and calcium intake and the risk
  of proliferative benign breast disease (BBD), a marker of increased breast cancer
  risk, have not yet been evaluated.
- We examined these associations in the Nurses’ Health Study II.
- Among the 29,480 women who completed an adolescent diet questionnaire in 1998, 682
  proliferative BBD cases were identified and confirmed by centralized pathology review
  between 1991 and 2001.
- Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated by Cox proportional
  hazards regression and adjusted for potential confounders.
- A suggestive inverse association was observed between adolescent total vitamin D
  intake and proliferative BBD.
- 'Women in the highest quintile of vitamin D intake during adolescence had a 21 %
  lower risk (multivariate HR (95 % CI): 0.79 (0.61, 1.01), _p_-trend = 0.07) of proliferative
  BBD than women in the lowest quintile.'
- Results were essentially the same when the analysis was restricted to prospective
  cases (_n_ = 142) diagnosed after return of the adolescent diet questionnaire and
  independent of adult vitamin D intake.
- 'Adolescent total milk intake was positively associated with proliferative BBD (≥3
  servings/day vs. &lt;1 serving/day HR (95 % CI): 1.41 (0.91, 2.17), _p_-trend =
  0.03), after additional adjustment for total vitamin D. Calcium intake during adolescence
  was not associated with proliferative BBD (_p_-trend = 0.91).'
- Vitamin D intake during adolescence may be important in the earlier stage of breast
  carcinogenesis.
- These findings, if corroborated, may suggest new pathways and strategies for breast
  cancer prevention.
- Vitamin D and calcium play important anticarcinogenic roles in cell proliferation,
  differentiation, and apoptosis in animal studies [1, 2].
- A meta-analysis of epidemiological studies reported significant inverse associations
  between intakes of vitamin D and calcium and breast cancer among premenopausal,
  but not postmenopausal women [3].
- Exposures during childhood and adolescence can be more important than adult exposures
  in breast cancer development [4–8] due to rapid proliferation of cells and lack
  of terminal differentiation.
- Whereas adolescent vitamin D intake was not associated with breast cancer risk in
  the Nurses’ Health Study (NHS) [9] or Nurses’ Health Study II (NHSII) [10], inverse
  associations were observed in a case–control study [11].
- Benign breast disease (BBD) includes various histologic subtypes, among which proliferative
  BBD is a marker of subsequent breast cancer risk [12].
- Studies of diet and BBD could provide insights into the role of diet in the earlier
  stage of breast carcinogenesis.
- A non-significant inverse association was found between adult calcium and BBD [13,
  14].
- Calcium plus vitamin D supplementation was not associated with breast cancer [15]
  or BBD in the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) [16].
- To our knowledge, the associations between adolescent intakes of vitamin D and calcium
  and proliferative BBD have not been examined in previous studies.
- We evaluated these associations and dairy consumption in relation to proliferative
  BBD in the NHSII, because dairy products are the main sources of dietary calcium
  and vitamin D. We further conducted analysis prospectively by restricting to cases
  diagnosed after the return of the adolescent diet questionnaire.
- The NHSII cohort was established in 1989 when 116,671 U.S. female registered nurses
  aged 25–42 years returned a self-administered questionnaire on health-related exposures
  and diseases.
- Biennial follow-up has been conducted since 1989.
- The current study included 45,948 women who completed a supplemental food-frequency
  questionnaire (FFQ) in 1998 with plausible energy intake values (600–5,000 kcal/day).
- The semi-quantitative 124-item HS-FFQ asked about the nurses’ usual dietary intake
  during adolescence, further defined as ages 13–18 years.
- The development of the HS-FFQ has been described in detail in another report [17].
- Briefly, it was modified from the well-validated adult diet FFQ of the NHS and NHSII
  and specifically designed to include commonly consumed food items (e.g.
- milkshakes, peanut butter, French fries, and other snack foods) when this cohort
  of women would have been in high school, i.e., from 1960 to 1982.
- There were eight categories including main dishes, bread/cereal/grains, fruits,
  vegetables, condiments, snack foods/desserts, dairy products, and beverages.
- Participants were asked how often, on average, they had consumed a specified portion
  size of each item during adolescence.
- Historical trends in the food supply enrichment with certain key vitamins, for instance,
  the vitamin D fortification of milk were incorporated in nutrient intake derivation.
- We used each participant’s year of birth and food composition data from the relevant
  time period (1960s and 1970s), whenever available, to assign different nutrient
  profiles for specific foods.
- In a reproducibility study among randomly selected 333 women who completed the HS-FFQ,
  the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) between two HS-FFQs administered in
  1998 and 2002 was 0.71 for total vitamin D, 0.68 for vitamin D without supplements,
  and 0.73 for calcium, and the Spearman correlation for dairy foods was 0.64 [17].
- 'The recalled adolescent diet was weakly correlated with the 1995 diet, the last
  adult dietary assessment before the 1998 HS-FFQ (total vitamin D: 0.16; vitamin
  D without supplements: 0.22; calcium: 0.13).'
- Correlations remained low using diet reported in 1999 [17].
- A validation study using data collected during adolescence from the participants
  who returned the HS-FFQ in 1998 is not possible because these women were 34–51 years
  at the time of HS-FFQ completion.
- However, 272 nurses’ mothers reported their daughters’ adolescent diet and adequate
  validity was found.
- The Pearson correlation was 0.48 for total vitamin D, 0.46 for vitamin D without
  supplements, and 0.47 for calcium [17].
- These findings indicate that the HS-FFQ provides a reasonable record of adolescent
  dietary intake.
- Details about BBD case identification, confirmation, and exclusion criteria have
  been published previously [18].
- Briefly, women who reported a biopsy-confirmed BBD diagnosis between the 1993 through
  2001 questionnaires were contacted for permission to obtain pathology specimens.
- Three pathologists (LCC, SJS, and JLC) blinded to participants’ adolescent diet
  information independently classified benign breast lesions as nonproliferative,
  proliferative without atypia, and atypical hyperplasia (AH, ductal, and lobular)
  following Dupont and Page’s criteria [19].
- The same three pathologists reviewed all benign biopsy slides throughout the study,
  and any biopsy specimens that showed atypia or questionable atypia were jointly
  reviewed by two pathologists.
- Pathology-confirmed proliferative BBD with or without atypia was the outcome of
  interest because this histological subtype is associated with increased breast cancer
  risk.
- The total number of proliferative BBD cases included was 682, among which 142 were
  prospective cases whose biopsy date was after their return of the HS-FFQ.
- Atypical hyperplasia (AH, ductal, and lobular) was not examined as a separate outcome
  due to the small numbers of cases (_n_ = 61 total AH cases; _n_ = 14 prospective
  AH cases).
- 'We conducted two main analyses: combined analysis including all proliferative BBD
  cases diagnosed before and after the return of the HS-FFQ and prospective analysis
  to assess the possibility of recall bias by restricting to cases diagnosed after
  completion of the HS-FFQ.'
- The combined analysis is the primary analysis because these results are consistent
  with those of the prospective analysis and have increased study power.
- Details of the two analyses have been published previously [18].
- The combined analysis included 29,480 participants with 259,828 person years of
  follow-up and the prospective analysis had 23,946 women (69,008 person years).
- The study was approved by human research committees at the Harvard School of Public
  Health and Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Boston, MA.
- 'The main exposures were adolescent total vitamin D (percent making-up: dairy vitamin
  D: 59.8 %, non-dairy vitamin D: 28.2 %, and vitamin D from supplements: 12.1 %)
  and calcium (81.4 % dairy calcium and 18.6 % non-dairy calcium).'
- Nutrients were energy-adjusted using the residuals from the linear regression of
  nutrient intake on total caloric intake [20].
- We also evaluated sources of vitamin D and calcium, including vitamin D without
  supplements, vitamin D supplements, dairy and non-dairy vitamin D, dairy and non-dairy
  calcium, and dairy protein.
- 'Raw nutrient values were derived for vitamin D supplements by subtracting vitamin
  D without supplements from total vitamin D and total energy included in the model
  for adjustment, due to very little correlation between vitamin D supplementation
  and total energy (Spearman correlation coefficient: 0.06).'
- Non-dairy vitamin D (calcium) was derived by subtracting dairy vitamin D (calcium)
  from vitamin D without supplements (total calcium) and energy-adjusted nutrient
  residuals calculated.
- 'Because milk was the major contributing food to vitamin D (making-up 41.6 % of
  total vitamin D, 47.3 % of vitamin D without supplements, and 72.9 % of dairy vitamin
  D) and calcium (making-up 40.6 % of total calcium and 56.1 % of dairy calcium) and
  dark fish the major contributing food to non-dairy vitamin D (total vitamin D: 8.7
  %; vitamin D without supplements: 9.9 %), we further examined the associations between
  consumption of these foods and proliferative BBD.'
- Quintiles of energy-adjusted nutrient residuals and categories of food servings
  were determined by the distributions among all eligible women.
- Cox proportional hazards regression was used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and
  95 % confidence intervals (CIs) with the lowest quintile or category as the reference
  group and follow-up time as the time variable.
- The multivariate Cox models were adjusted for age, total energy, age at menarche,
  menopausal status, childhood body size, family history of breast cancer, alcohol
  intake between ages 18 and 22, adolescent multivitamin use, recency and duration
  of oral contraceptive (OC) use, and parity and age at first birth.
- Models with total vitamin D, vitamin D supplements, and calcium as exposures were
  not adjusted for multivitamin use due to the consideration of colinearity.
- Adolescent multivitamin use was asked and energy intake calculated from the HS-FFQ.
- Age at menarche, alcohol intake between ages 18 and 22, and childhood body size
  were assessed in 1989.
- The body size measurement asked women to choose one of nine pictorial diagrams (somatotypes)
  that best depicted their body outline at ages 5 and 10, where level 1 represents
  the most lean and level 9 represents the most overweight [21].
- The childhood body size was obtained by averaging the figures at ages 5 and 10.
- Age, menopausal status, OC use, and parity and age at first birth were updated every
  2 years.
- Family history of breast cancer was initially assessed in 1989 and updated in 1997.
- To test for trend, the Wald statistic was calculated by including the median value
  of each quintile or category as a continuous variable.
- All statistical tests were two sided.
- Women with high intake of total vitamin D and calcium were more likely to be older
  at first birth, have smaller childhood body size, and have used multivitamins during
  adolescence, but less likely to have ever used OC than women with lower intake (Table
  1).
- The Spearman correlation coefficient was 0.69 for vitamin D and calcium, 0.95 for
  dairy vitamin D and dairy calcium, and 0.25 for non-dairy vitamin D and non-dairy
  calcium (all _p_ &lt; 0.0001).

- 'Adjustment for adult vitamin D intake did not change the estimates (multivariate

- Higher intake of vitamin D without supplements and from supplements was also associated
  with lower proliferative BBD risk, although no significant trend was observed.
- No association was observed for dairy vitamin D (_p_-trend = 0.67).
- 'For non-dairy vitamin D, reduction of proliferative BBD risk was observed in the

  To our knowledge, this is the first study to comprehensively examine the associations
  between adolescent intakes of various sources of vitamin D and calcium and the risk
  of proliferative BBD.'
- We observed a suggestive inverse association between adolescent intake of total
  vitamin D and proliferative BBD.
- Total milk intake was associated with an increased risk of proliferative BBD, after
  additional adjustment for total vitamin D. The highest intake level of non-dairy
  vitamin D was associated with a reduced risk, whereas no association was found between
  dairy vitamin D and proliferative BBD.
- Our study may have limited power to detect a significant association for vitamin
  D from supplements, because only 16 % of women used multivitamin during adolescence.
- Dark fish, the major source of adolescent non-dairy vitamin D in our study, was
  marginally associated with proliferative BBD.
- One possible explanation could be that the inverse association attributed to vitamin
  D is due to dark fish.
- Alternatively, this difference could be an artifact of differential recall for different
  foods and the recall of fish intake may be better than that of other foods and hence
  less measurement error.
- Nonetheless, recall of milk was highly reproducible and in general dairy foods had
  higher correlations between the first and second administration than main dishes
  [17].
- Finally, it may be not differences in the vitamin D in dairy and non-dairy products
  that affect BBD risk, but that other nutrients in milk or dairy products might be
  linked to increased risk and mask the effect of vitamin D in these products.
- More research on adolescent diet and breast disease may provide further insights
  into these issues.
- The reduction in risk for non-dairy vitamin D was only found in the 5th quintile.
- Future studies need to ascertain the optimal vitamin D intake from different sources
  during adolescence.
- It is hypothesized that Vitamin D exerts protective effects on breast carcinogenesis
  mainly through its metabolites.
- Animal studies have shown that 1,25(OH)2D, the biologically active vitamin D metabolite,
  can inhibit cellular proliferation and angiogenesis and induce differentiation and
  apoptosis [1].
- Higher levels of circulating 25(OH)D, the precursor of 1,25(OH)2D and best indicator
  of endogenous vitamin D status, have been related to lower breast cancer risk [3].
- A statistically significant inverse association between vitamin D intake and breast
  cancer has been observed among premenopausal but not postmenopausal women [3].
- A possible explanation to the difference by menopausal status could be due to biologic
  interactions between vitamin D metabolites, the vitamin D receptor, and the higher
  circulating estrogen and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) [1] among premenopausal
  than postmenopausal women [22, 23].
- Vitamin D could suppress 17β-estradiol and IGF-I-stimulated cellular growth, inhibit
  the antiapoptotic effect of IGF-I, and decrease expression levels of receptors of
  estrogen and IGF-I [1].
- Meanwhile, the expression of VDR can be upregulated by estrogen and IGF-I in breast
  cancer cells [1].
- Because a majority of participants (&gt;95 %) in our study were premenopausal at
  the time of their BBD, it is possible that vitamin D may interact with other hormones
  to reduce proliferative BBD risk.
- Adolescent vitamin D intake was, however, not associated with breast cancer risk
  in the NHS or NHSII cohorts [9, 10].
- One possible explanation is that vitamin D may be more important in the earlier
  breast carcinogenic process.
- Conversely, inverse associations were observed between adolescent vitamin D exposures
  and breast cancer in a case–control study [11].
- Future studies, particularly studies focusing on the late stage from BBD to breast
  cancer development, will further illuminate the role of vitamin D in breast carcinogenesis.
- No association has been observed between adolescent [24] or adult dairy intake and
  BBD [25–27].
- Results on the associations between adolescent [11, 28, 29] or adult dairy intake
  and breast cancer [30] have been inconsistent.
- Few studies, however, have taken vitamin D or calcium into account when examining
  dairy consumption and breast disease risk.
- Previous studies have linked higher milk intake with more rapid child growth [31,
  32].
- Childhood and adolescent vitamin D and dairy intake may influence hormone levels
  and/or growth during this critical period and set endocrine profiles in adulthood,
  thus affecting subsequent breast disease and/or cancer risk.
- Considering the varying practices of vitamin D fortification in different countries
  and the high correlation between various nutrients in dairy products, it will be
  important to understand the relation between milk and dairy consumption, circulating
  hormone levels, and breast disease risk across the life course.
- Adolescent calcium intake was not associated with proliferative BBD in our study.
- Adjustment for calcium intake, however, strengthened the vitamin D-BBD association.
- Given the much stronger correlation between dairy vitamin D and dairy calcium (0.95)
  than that between vitamin D and calcium from non-dairy sources (0.25), one possible
  explanation could be that the adjustment for calcium is basically adjusting for
  dairy intake, leaving mostly the non-dairy vitamin D. Alternatively, these results
  may suggest that the association observed for vitamin D is independent of calcium.
- This is the first study to comprehensively assess the associations between adolescent
  intakes of various sources of vitamin D and calcium and the subsequent BBD.
- The centralized pathology review and confirmation minimized misclassification of
  BBD cases.
- We included a large number of cases and had sufficient power to detect significant
  associations.
- The consistent results obtained from the combined and prospective analyses, suggesting
  that any possible recall bias due to BBD diagnosis or changes in diet after diagnosis
  should be minimal.
- The essentially equivalent results of the age- and multivariate-adjusted analyses
  suggest that uncontrolled confounding is unlikely to entirely account for the observed
  associations.
- One limitation of this study is the measurement of adolescent diet.
- In our study, women recalled their adolescent dietary intake 16–38 years later.
- Although comparison with maternal reports provides some reassurance, the validity
  of recall after so many years has not been established.
- However, the observed association was independent of current intake.
- Another limitation for vitamin D is the assessment of diet only.
- Since a high percentage of vitamin D exposure comes from ultraviolet B radiation
  via sunlight to skin, the measurement of vitamin D dietary intake is only a weak
  indicator of vitamin D status.
- Nonetheless, information on adolescent sunlight exposure or geographical residential
  region as a proxy of sunlight exposure was not available in NHSII.
- In the absence of dietary data actually collected during adolescence and given that
  collecting blood samples and measuring adolescent circulating 25(OH)D would not
  be feasible in this sort of cohort study, our results provide the best estimate
  currently available of relationships between adolescent vitamin D intake and proliferative
  BBD.
- In summary, we observed suggestive inverse associations between adolescent intake
  of total vitamin D and non-dairy vitamin D and proliferative BBD.
- Our results support the hypothesis that early life exposures are important in breast
  carcinogenesis.
- As diet is a modifiable risk factor, these findings, if substantiated, may open
  new pathways and strategies for breast cancer prevention.
