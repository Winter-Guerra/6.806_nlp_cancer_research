- In the present study, we addressed the question whether cyanidin-3-glucoside (C3G)
  or complex C3G-rich blackberry extracts affect human topoisomerases with special
  emphasis on the contribution of the potential degradation products phloroglucinol
  aldehyde (PGA) and protocatechuic acid (PCA).
- In HT29 colon carcinoma cells a C3G-rich blackberry extract suppressed camptothecin-
  (CPT-) or doxorubicin- (DOX-) induced stabilization of the covalent DNA–topoisomerase
  intermediate, thus antagonizing the effects of these classical topoisomerase poisons
  on DNA integrity.
- As a single compound, C3G (100 μM) decreased the DNA-damaging effects of CPT as
  well, but did not significantly affect those induced by DOX.
- At the highest applied concentration (100 μM), cyanidin protected DNA from CPT-
  and DOX-induced damage.
- Earlier reports on DNA-damaging properties of cyanidin were found to result most
  likely from the formation of hydrogen peroxide as an artifact in the cell culture
  medium when the incubation was performed in the absence of catalase.
- The suppression of hydrogen peroxide accumulation, achieved by the addition of catalase,
  demonstrated that cyanidin does not exhibit DNA-damaging properties in HT29 cells
  (up to 100 μM).
- The observed effects on topoisomerase interference and DNA protection against CPT
  or DOX were clearly limited to the parent compound and were not observed for the
  potential cyanidin degradation products PGA and PCA.
- Epidemiological studies emphasize that a diet rich in fruits and vegetables is associated
  with a lower incidence of cancer.
- (1, 2) Anthocyanins represent a class of colored plant constituents comprising a
  color spectrum from red to blue that occur in many fruits and vegetables of the
  daily diet.
- In the United States, the consumption of anthocyanins has been estimated to be higher
  than that of other flavonoids such as quercetin.
- (3) In addition, based on their proposed health benefits, anthocyanins are widely
  consumed with functional foods and food supplements.
- '(4)


  Berry anthocyanins have been reported to exhibit anticancer properties in vivo.'
- (5-8) In vitro studies have demonstrated that several overlapping mechanisms of
  action might contribute to their biological effects, including the inhibition of
  receptor tyrosine kinases,(9-11) the induction of apoptosis,(12-14) and the interference
  with human topoisomerases.
- (15-17) We previously reported that the free aglycone delphinidin, a so-called anthocyanidin,
  acts as a catalytic topoisomerase inhibitor in human colon carcinoma cells and diminishes
  the DNA-damaging properties of classical topoisomerase poisons.
- '(17)


  The bioavailability of anthocyanins is reported to be quite limited depending on
  the structure of the aglycone and the sugar moieties.'
- (18, 19) Under in vitro conditions, limited chemical stability of the nonglycosylated
  anthocyanidins has been repeatedly reported.
- (6, 20-22) Several authors have confirmed that protocatechuic acid (PCA) is the
  dominant degradation product of cyanidin in cell culture.
- (20-22) In addition, anthocyanins as well as their respective aglycones, have been
  discussed to represent substrates for microbial degradation by human intestinal
  bacteria, also resulting in the formation of the respective benzoic acids and phloroglucinol
  aldehyde (PGA(23-25)).
- So far, the cellular effects of the free aglycons, the anthocyanidins, have been
  part of numerous studies, whereas knowledge on the biological relevance of the glycosylated
  anthocyanins, as well as the formed degradation products, which have a higher chemical
  and microbial stabilities, is quite limited.
- Furthermore, several reports have discussed the question of whether the formation
  of hydrogen peroxide under cell culture conditions, resulting from the reaction
  of polyphenols with yet-unknown culture medium constituents, leads to in vitro artifacts,
  thereby interfering with the cellular effectiveness of the respective polyphenols.
- '(26-30)


  In the present study, we addressed the question whether interference with topoisomerases
  is limited to the free anthocyanidins or whether the respective glycosides, exemplified
  for cyanidin-3-glucoside (C3G), or even complex C3G-rich blackberry extracts also
  affect human topoisomerases.'
- The aim of the study was to elucidate whether C3G-rich blackberry extracts, already
  available as food supplements, are likely to suppress the DNA-damaging properties
  of topoisomerase poisons used clinically for cancer treatment with special emphasis
  on the potential contribution of C3G and its corresponding degradation products.
- For comparison, the aglycone cyanidin, which is not present in native blackberry
  extracts but might be liberated after bacterial deglycosylation, was included in
  the testing.
- Cyanidin was purchased from Extrasynthèse (Genay, France), whereas camptothecin
  (CPT), doxorubicine (DOX), protocatechuic acid (PCA), phloroglucinol aldehyde (PGA),
  and catalase were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Gmbh (Munich, Germany).
- Cyanidin-3-glucoside (C3G) was obtained from Carl Roth GmbH (Karlsruhe, Germany).
- For all assays, the compound solutions were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)
  before the beginning of the experiment, without use of stored stock solutions.
- The blackberry extract was an XAD-7-purified extract and was obtained from Prof.
  P. Winterhalter, University of Braunschweig (Braunschweig, Germany).
- Anthocyanin measurements were carried out by high-performance liquid chromatography
  (HPLC)/diode array detector (DAD)/tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS).
- Analysis was performed on an HP 1200 series instrument (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn,
  Germany) equipped with a degaser, a binary HPLC pump, a DAD, an autoinjector, and
  a column oven.
- For HPLC conditions, please see ref 31.
- The eluent was recorded with diode array detection at 520 nm for quantification
  of the anthocyanins.
- For identification, the HPLC system was directly coupled to a hybrid triple-quadrupole
  linear ion-trap mass spectrometer (3200 QTrap; AB Sciex, Darmstadt, Germany), equipped
  with a TurboIonSpray source.
- The analytes were detected in positive-ion mode at a vaporizer temperature of 650
  °C and an ion-spray voltage of 5.5 kV.
- Nitrogen was used for both curtain gas and collision gas, at 10 psi and medium,
  respectively.
- The collision energy and declustering potential were set to 10 V. Data acquisition
  was performed in full scan mode (enhanced mass spectrometry mode).
- Identification and quantification of further polyphenols (flavonoids, phenolic acids)
  was performed as described previously.
- (32, 33) Quantification of all compounds (anthocyanins, flavonoids, phenolic acids)
  was performed by external calibration using commercially available reference compounds.
- Calibration curves for the different polyphenols were constructed in the range of
  0.05–100 μM in which the response was linear.
- The quantification of those polyphenols that are not commercial available was based
  on a representative standard of the same polyphenol class.
- The limits of detection ranged between 200 fmol and 6 pmol.
- The anthocyanin content in the blackberry extract was 100 mg/(g of extract).
- C3G, cyanidin-3-dioxalyl glucoside, cyanidin-3-rutinoside, cyanidin pentoside, and
  two further cyanidin derivatives were identified, with C3G [76 mg/(g of extract)]
  as the major compound (Table 1).
- The human colon carcinoma cell line HT29 was cultivated in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
  medium (DMEM with 4500 mg/L glucose, without sodium pyruvate).
- Cell culture medium was supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin
  (PS).
- DMEM and the supplements were obtained from Invitrogen Life Technologies (Karlsruhe,
  Germany).
- Briefly, 5000 HT29 cells were seeded per well into 24-well plates and allowed to
  grow for 48 h before treatment.
- Thereafter, cells were incubated with the respective drug in the absence or presence
  of catalase (100 U/mL) for 72 h in serum-containing medium.
- Effects on cell growth were determined according to the method of Skehan et al.
- (34) previously described by Kern et al.

  Briefly, 40000 HT29 cells were seeded per well into 24-well plates and allowed to
  grow for 48 h before treatment.'
- The incubation conditions were adjusted according to the SRB assay, with incubation
  in the presence of catalase (100 U/mL) in serum-containing medium.
- The formation of hydrogen peroxide was measured after several time points (15 min,
  45 min, 24 h, and 72 h) using the Amplex Red hydrogen peroxide assay kit from Sigma
  (Taufkirchen, Germany) following the manufacturer's protocol.
- HT29 cells (3 × 105 in 5 mL of serum-containing medium) were spread into Petri dishes
  (_d_ = 5 cm) and allowed to grow for 48 h prior to treatment with drugs.
- In the experiments with single compounds, HT29 cells were treated for 1 h with the
  solvent control [1% (v/v) DMSO] or the test compounds in serum-free medium in the
  presence of catalase (100 U/mL).
- For the coincubation experiments, HT29 cells were preincubated for 30 min with the
  solvent control [0.2% (v/v) DMSO] or the respective test compound and were then
  coincubated for 1 h with 100 μM CPT or 10 μM doxorubicin.
- The comet assay was performed according to the method of Gedik et al.
- (35) previously reported by Esselen et al.
- '(17)



  The ICE bioassay was performed with slight modifications as described previously
  by Esselen et al.'
- (17) According to this method, 1.2 × 106 HT29 cells were spread into Petri dishes
  (two Petri dishes for one concentration) and allowed to grow for 48 h. Thereafter,
  the cells were incubated with the solvent control [1% (v/v) DMSO], CPT, DOX, or
  blackberry extract under serum-free conditions.
- For the coincubation experiments, HT29 cells were treated for 30 min with the solvent
  control [0.2% (v/v) DMSO; 1% (v/v) DMSO in the case of C3G] or blackberry extract
  and then coincubated for 1 h with 10 μM CPT or 10 μM DOX.
- The medium was removed, and the cells were abraded at room temperature in 3 mL of
  TE buffer [10 mM tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (Tris), pH 8.0, 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic
  acid (EDTA), 1% (w/v) _N_-laurylsarcosyl sodium salt].
- Cell lysates were layered onto a cesium chloride gradient in polyallomer tubes (14
  mL, SW40, Beckman Coulter GmbH, Krefeld, Germany).
- One gradient consisted of four layers (2 mL/layer) of cesium chloride with a decreasing
  density from the bottom to the top.
- The tubes were centrifuged at 100,000_g_ for 24 h at 20 °C.
- The gradients were fractionated (300 μL/fraction) from the bottom of the tubes.
- The DNA content in the single fractions was determined by measuring the absorbency
  at 260 nm using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (PeqLab Biotechnologie GmbH, Erlangen,
  Germany), and all fractions were blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane using a
  slot blot apparatus (Minifold II, Whatman/Schleicher &amp; Schuell, Dassel, Germany).
- Topoisomerase was detected using a rabbit polyclonal antibody against topoisomerase
  I (1:250 dilution), topoisomerase IIα (1:500 dilution), or topoisomerase IIβ (1:500
  dilution).
- An antimouse IgG peroxidase conjugate (1:2000) or an antirabbit IgG peroxidase conjugate
  (1:2000) was used as secondary antibodies.
- All antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Heidelberg, Germany).
- The respective chemoluminescent signals (LumiGLO, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers,
  MA) were analyzed using the LAS 3000 with the AIDA Image Analyzer 3.52 software
  for quantification (Raytest, Straubenhardt, Germany).
- Arbitrary light units were plotted as the ratio of test to control (%).
- The effects of blackberry extract, the major anthocyanin C3G, and the potential
  degradation products PCA and PGA on the growth of HT29 cells were determined using
  the SRB assay.
- The blackberry extract potently inhibited the growth of HT29 cells with a half-maximal
  inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 120 ± 30 μg/mL (Table 2).
- The presence of catalase significantly diminished its growth inhibitory properties
  (IC50 ≥ 200 μg/mL).
- In the absence of catalase, C3G exhibited marginal growth inhibitory properties
  without reaching an IC50 value of up to 300 μM in the cell culture medium.
- In the presence of catalase, no effect on tumor cell growth was observed (Table
  2).
- We reported previously that the aglycone cyanidin suppresses the growth of HT29
  cells in micromolar concentrations,(36) yet the present study revealed that the
  addition of catalase to the cell culture medium is associated with a complete loss
  of growth inhibitory properties in concentrations up to 300 μM (Table 2).
- Among the degradation products, PGA potently diminished the growth of HT29 cells
  (IC50 = 175 ± 67 μM).
- Of note, the presence of catalase did not affect its growth inhibitory properties
  (Table 2).
- In contrast, growth inhibition mediated by PCA as previously described in ref 20
  was slightly diminished in the presence of catalase (Table 2).
- Table 2.
- "Effects of the Test Compounds on the Growth of Human Colon Carcinoma Cells Using
  the Sulforhodamine B Assaya)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo assess whether cyanidin
  leads to increased extracellular hydrogen peroxide formation in DMEM media, HT29
  cells were incubated with cyanidin for 72 h. The hydrogen peroxide concentration
  in the cell culture medium was measured after 15 min, 45 min, 24 h, and 72 h. The
  short-time incubation of cyanidin (15 min) determined the concentration-dependent
  formation of hydrogen peroxide in the micromolar range (Figure 1A), which was slightly
  enhanced after 45 min (Figure 1A)."
- Coincubation with catalase reduced the hydrogen peroxide concentration in the cell
  culture medium to the level of the solvent control (Figure 1A).
- After both 24 and 72 h, no hydrogen peroxide accumulation in the medium of HT29
  cells was detected (data not shown).
- Figure 1.

  experiments, each performed in duplicate.
- (B) Single-cell gel electrophoresis (comet assay) with HT29 cells.
- Cells were treated under serum-free conditions with cyanidin in the presence or

- The data presented are the means ± standard deviations of at least three independent
  experiments, each performed in duplicate.
- Significances indicated refer to the significance level as compared to the respective
  control (Student’s _t_-test  = _p_ &lt; 0.05,  = _p_ &lt; 0.01).
- The impact of hydrogen peroxide formation on the DNA-damaging properties of cyanidin
  was investigated in the comet assay.
- To determine a possible contribution of hydrogen peroxide to the DNA-damaging properties
  of cyanidin, HT29 cells were incubated with cyanidin in either the absence or the
  presence of catalase (100 U/mL).
- In line with earlier results,(16) in the absence of catalase, cyanidin increased
  the amount of DNA strand breaks in HT29 cells in a concentration-dependent fashion
  (Figure 1B).
- At concentrations of ≥50 μM cyanidin, a significant increase of DNA strand breakage
  was observed.
- In contrast, in the presence of catalase (Figure 1B), cyanidin did not induce DNA
  damage in HT29 cells up to 100 μM.
- Furthermore, the DNA-strand-breaking properties of the anthocyanin C3G (up to 100
  μM) and the degradation products PGA and PCA (up to 100 μM) were investigated in
  the comet assay.
- In the presence of catalase, none of the test compounds induced DNA strand breakage
  in HT29 cells after 1 h of incubation (data not shown).
- We reported previously that hydroxylated anthocyanidins such as delphinidin act
  as a catalytic topoisomerase inhibitor, suppressing the stabilizing effect of the
  topoisomerase poisons CPT,(16) etoposide, and DOX(17) on the covalent topoisomerase–DNA
  intermediate, thus decreasing the DNA-damaging potential of these antineoplastic
  agents in human colon carcinoma cells.
- In the present study, we addressed the question whether these effects are limited
  to the free aglycon (cyanidin) or whether a respective glycoside (C3G) or even a
  C3G-rich complex extract (blackberry) affects the rate of topoisomerase poison-induced
  DNA strand breaks as well.
- Furthermore, we also addressed the question whether putative anthocyanin degradation
  products (PGA, PCA) contribute to the potential DNA-protective effect of the extract.
- HT29 cells were pretreated for 30 min with the respective test compound and then
  coincubated with CPT (100 μM) or DOX (10 μM) for 1 h. As expected, treatment of
  HT29 cells with CPT or DOX as single compounds resulted in a significant increase
  of DNA strand breaks (Figure 2A-C).
- Figure 2.

  (CPT) or doxorubicin (DOX) in HT29 cells in the presence of catalase (100 U/mL)
  tested in the comet assay.
- For the coincubation experiments, HT29 cells were preincubated for 30 min with the
  solvent control (0.2% DMSO) or the respective test compound and then coincubated
  for 1 h with 100 μM CPT or 10 μM DOX.
- DMSO [0.2% (v/v)] was included in the testing as the solvent control.
- All incubations were performed in the presence of catalase (100 U/mL).
- The data presented are the means ± standard deviations of at least three independent
  experiments, each performed in duplicate.
- 'Significances indicated refer the significance level compared to the respective
  control (Student’s _t_-test  = _p_ &lt; 0.001) or to the respective topoisomerase
  poison (CPT or DOX; Student’s _t_-test # = _p_ &lt; 0.05, ### = _p_ &lt; 0.001).'
- In the presence of blackberry extract (≥1 μg/mL), the DNA-damaging effects of CPT
  and DOX were diminished to a significant extent and in a concentration-dependent
  fashion (Figure 2A).
- The major anthocyanin of the blackberry extract, C3G, significantly reduced the
  rate of DNA strand breaks induced by CPT at a concentration of 100 μM.
- In the case of DOX (in combination with C3G), a slight but not significant decrease
  of DNA damage was observed (Figure 2B).
- The treatment with the aglycone cyanidin resulted in a concentration-dependent decrease
  of the amount of CPT- and DOX-induced DNA strand breaks, with a significant effectiveness
  at 100 μM cyanidin (Figure 2C).
- In contrast, the potential degradation products PCA and PGA did not affect the DNA-strand-breaking
  properties of the topoisomerase poisons CPT and DOX (data not shown).
- 'Blackberry Extract Diminishes Cleavable Complex Stabilization by Topoisomerase
  Poisons


  Delphinidin was characterized as a pure catalytic topoisomerase inhibitor within
  intact human colon carcinoma cells.'
- (17) However, so far, little is known about the impact of glycosylated anthocyanins
  and their degradation products on topoisomerase inhibition within intact tumor cells.
- In this study, we used the ICE bioassay(17) to directly determine the amount of
  topoisomerase covalently linked to the DNA (see Materials and Methods).
- After 1 h of incubation, CPT (10 μM) potently enhanced the amount of topoisomerase
  I in the DNA-containing fractions, indicative of a cleavable complex (covalent DNA–topoisomerase
  intermediate) stabilization (Figure 3A).
- The topoisomerase II poison DOX (10 μM) highly elevated the level of topoisomerase
  IIα (Figure 3A) and IIβ (data not shown) bound to DNA.
- In contrast, treatment of HT29 cells with the anthocyanin-rich blackberry extract
  (50 μg/mL) did not result in a stabilization of the topoisomerase/DNA intermediate,
  presented for topoisomerase I and IIα as examples in Figure 3A.
- Figure 3.
- (A) Detection of the covalent topoisomerase I and topoisomerase IIα/DNA intermediate

- A representative immunoblot of three independent experiments is shown.
- Impacts of (B) blackberry extract and (C) C3G and protocatechuic acid on the camptothecin-
  or doxorubicin-stabilized enzyme/DNA complexes in the ICE assay.
- HT29 cells were pretreated with blackberry extract, C3G, or protocatechuic acid
  for 30 min and then coincubated with blackberry extract, C3G, or protocatechuic
  acid and CPT (10 μM) or DOX (10 μM) for 1 h. The treatment was performed in the
  presence of catalase (100 U/mL).
- A representative immunoblot is shown.
- The level of topoisomerase/DNA intermediate was calculated as the ratio of coincubated
  cells to control cells (treated with the respective topoisomerase poison) with respect
  to DNA content × 100% (T/C, %).
- The data presented are the means ± standard deviations of three independent experiments.
- Significances indicated refer the significance level compared to the respective
  topoisomerase poison CPT or DOX (Student’s _t_-test  = _p_ &lt; 0.01,  = _p_ &lt;
  0.001).
- The above-mentioned results indicate that blackberry anthocyanins target topoisomerases
  prior to their binding to the DNA.
- To extend this hypothesis, the ICE assay was used for competition studies in cultured
  HT29 cells (Figure 3B).
- HT29 cells were pretreated with the blackberry extract, C3G, or the degradation
  product PCA for 30 min and then coincubated with the extract, C3G or PCA, and CPT
  or DOX in combination for 1 h. Blackberry extract at a concentration of 10 μg/mL
  significantly reduced the amount of topoisomerase I covalently bound to DNA stabilized
  by 10 μM CPT (Figure 3B).
- At a concentration of 50 μg/mL blackberry extract, the DNA–topoisomerase I binding
  was diminished by up to 20% in comparison to the respective CPT-treated control
  cells.
- The levels of topoisomerase IIα and IIβ in the DNA peak fractions stabilized by
  DOX (10 μM) were significantly decreased after pre- and coincubation with 50 μg/mL
  blackberry extract (Figure 3B), with a slightly more pronounced effect on the topoisomerase
  IIα isoform.
- In contrast, C3G in concentrations up to 250 μM and the tested degradation product
  PCA at a concentration of 250 μM did not modulate the amount of topoisomerase I/IIα
  covalently bound to DNA (Figure 3C).
- We reported previously that the anthocyanidin delphinidin acts as a catalytic topoisomerase
  inhibitor in human colon carcinoma cells and diminishes the DNA-damaging properties
  of classical topoisomerase poisons,(17) indicating an additional molecular mechanism
  to be considered in the spectrum of bioactive features of this food constituent.
- These results raised the question whether high consumption of anthocyanidins in
  humans might compromise the outcome of respective cancer therapy.
- However, with respect to the potential relevance of these findings, it has to be
  taken into account that free anthocyanidins are rare in natural food items and rather
  are consumed predominantly in their glycosylated form within complex polyphenol
  mixtures.
- Further, it must be taken into account that intensive degradation might occur within
  the gastrointestinal tract, probably contributing to the bioactivity of these products.
- Thus, in the present study, we compared the effects of the free aglycon (cyanidin)
  with those of a respective glycoside (C3G), a complex blackberry extract containing
  C3G as the major anthocyanidin (Table 1), and the potential cyanidin degradation
  products PCA and PGA.
- The effects on tumor cell growth were determined.
- The blackberry extract was found to diminish cell growth of HT29 cells, although
  the presence of catalase significantly attenuated this effect (Table 2).
- In accordance with earlier reports,(36) the free aglycone cyanidin was found to
  exhibit potent growth inhibitory properties.
- The addition of catalase resulted in a loss of any growth inhibitory properties
  of cyanidin as well as the respective glycoside (C3G) (Table 2), suggesting that
  the formation of hydrogen peroxide acts as a major contributor to the observed growth
  inhibitory effects, thus generating experimental artifacts that are presumably limited
  to the conditions of the cell culture medium.
- Different authors have reported substantial hydrogen peroxide formation under cell
  culture conditions.
- (26-30) Short-time incubation of HT29 cells with cyanidin (15 min) indeed demonstrated
  the concentration-dependent formation of hydrogen peroxide in the cell culture medium
  in the micromolar range, even being slightly enhanced after 45 min (Figure 1).
- Addition of catalase effectively diminished the hydrogen peroxide concentration
  in the cell culture medium down to the level of the solvent control.
- Yet, after long-time incubation (24 and 72 h), no enhanced hydrogen peroxide level
  was detected (data not shown).
- The observation that hydrogen peroxide accumulation seems to be an early event,
  yet changing cell signaling constantly, is in line with earlier findings.
- (20) Furthermore, the contribution of hydrogen peroxide to the detected growth inhibition
  of the test compounds in the absence of catalase can be assumed.
- Taken together, the data enforce the necessity of adding a H2O2-scavenging system
  to in vitro cell culture assays when effects of polyphenol structures are applied
  for testing.
- Several publications have discussed the possibility that biological effects might
  be mediated not by anthocyanins themselves(7, 37, 38) but rather by the released
  aglycons or even respective degradation products such as PGA and PCA.
- (20, 21) Of note, only PGA displayed growth inhibition properties (Table 2).
- In 2009, Woodward et al.
- investigated the degradation of C3G to PGA and PCA.
- (39) In accordance with our results, concentrations where growth inhibitory effects
  of PGA were achieved were nearly 100-fold higher than the maximum concentrations
  that might arise from the degradation of C3G in the blackberry extract concentrations
  applied in the present study.
- Thus, the detected effects of PGA on cell growth appear not to be of relevance for
  the influence of the overall extract.
- To investigate whether generated hydrogen peroxide might also contribute to the
  DNA-damaging properties of cyanidin, a comet assay was performed in both the presence
  and the absence of catalase.
- In line with earlier results,(16) in the absence of catalase, cyanidin did increase
  the amount of DNA strand breaks in HT29 in a concentration-dependent fashion (Figure
  1B).
- Yet, the addition of catalase reduced this effect to the level of the solvent control.
- Furthermore, neither the blackberry extract nor the isolated constituent C3G nor
  the degradation products PGA and PCA induced DNA strand breaks in HT29 cells in
  the presence of catalase (data not shown).
- In contrast, the blackberry extract (Figure 2A), C3G (Figure 2B), and cyanidin (in
  the presence of catalase, Figure 2C) were identified as protectors against DNA-damaging
  topoisomerase poisons.
- Because 76% of the blackberry anthocyanins within the tested extract represents
  C3G, the contribution of C3G to the detected DNA-protective properties of the blackberry
  extract from topoisomerase I poisons (CPT) can be assumed.
- Hence, the more potent protection from topoisomerase I poison-caused damage by C3G
  might also explain the stronger protective effects of the C3G-rich extract from
  DNA damage caused by CPT (Figure 2A).
- The high DNA-protective properties of cyanidin are in line with previously reported
  data, where we demonstrated that the anthocyanidin delphinidin acts as a catalytic
  topoisomerase inhibitor suppressing the DNA-strand-breaking effects of different
  topoisomerase poisons (CPT,(16) etoposide, and DOX(17)).
- Of note, the cyanidin degradation products PCA and PGA did not protect HT29 cells
  from the DNA-strand-breaking properties of the two topoisomerase poisons (data not
  shown).
- Therefore, the potent DNA-protecting properties can be attributed to the parent
  compound, implying that degradation is expected to result in a loss of DNA-protective
  properties.
- Interestingly, the complex blackberry extract turned out to be more potent than
  expected based on the anthocyanin content, indicating the presence of further constituents
  with DNA-protective qualities.
- To gain further information on the mode of action, the amount of topoisomerase covalently
  linked to the DNA in HT29 cells was determined by the use of the ICE bioassay.
- (17) Different authors have reported that flavonoids suppress the activity of human
  topoisomerases and thereby alter DNA integrity.
- (16, 40, 41) Anthocyanidins bearing vicinal hydroxyl groups at the B-ring, such
  as cyanidin or delphinidin, could be identified as pure catalytic topoisomerase
  inhibitors, lacking stabilizing effects on the covalent enzyme/DNA intermediate,
  whereas polyphenols such as genistein or (−)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate seem to
  act as topoisomerase poisons thereby forming a covalent complex with the DNA–topoisomerase
  intermediate.
- (15, 17, 40, 41) In a recent study berry extracts (bilberry, grape), rich in glycosylated
  anthocyanins, potently diminish topoisomerase I and topoisomerase II activity with
  a preference to topoisomerase II.
- '(42)


  In contrast to CPT, which induced cleavable complex stabilization of topoisomerase
  I (Figure 3A), or DOX, which strongly elevated the levels of topoisomerase IIα (Figure
  3A) and IIβ bound to DNA, the anthocyanin-rich blackberry extract (50 μg/mL) did
  not result in a stabilization of the topoisomerase–DNA intermediate (up to 50 μg/mL;
  Figure 3A) and thus appears not to act as a topoisomerase poison.'
- To evaluate whether the blackberry anthocyanins, C3G, or the cyanidin degradation
  product PCA might target topoisomerases prior to their binding to DNA, as reported
  previously for the free aglycone delphinidin, the ICE assay was used for competition
  studies.
- Pretreatment of HT29 cells with the blackberry extract (50 μg/mL) for 30 min before
  coincubation with CPT resulted in a significantly reduced amount of topoisomerase
  I covalently bound to DNA, already at low extract concentrations (Figure 3B).
- Furthermore, the level of DOX- (10 μM) stabilized topoisomerase IIα and IIβ in the
  DNA peak fractions was significantly decreased by coincubation with blackberry extract,
  with a slightly more pronounced effect on the topoisomerase IIα isoform (Figure
  3B).
- Thus, the blackberry extract again exhibited a slightly more potent capacity to
  prevent from topoisomerase I poison- (CPT-) induced DNA damage, supporting the results
  detected in the comet assay.
- In contrast to the blackberry extract, C3G (250 μM) and the degradation product
  PCA (250 μM) did not modulate the stability of the DNA/topoisomerase complex I and
  IIα (Figure 3C).
- Thus, a contribution of C3G or its degradation product PCA to the effects of the
  blackberry extract seems to be unlikely.
- Taken together, our data show that pretreatment of cells with blackberry extract
  diminishes the cleavable complex stabilizing effect of topoisomerase I and II poisons.
- In cell-free test systems, cyanidin was already identified as a potent inhibitor
  of topoisomerase activity.
- (16) Taking into account the DNA-protective effects of C3G seen in the comet assay,
  a contribution of C3G to the DNA-protective properties of the blackberry extract
  seems to be conceivable, also presumably not mediated by decreasing the levels of
  covalent DNA–topoisomerase intermediates.
- Yet, earlier studies also identified complex polyphenolic extracts as even more
  potent modulators of topoisomerase activity than isolated constituents.
- Hence, synergistic effects and/or a contribution of yet-unknown constituents might
  have to be considered.
- Oligomeric and polymeric procyanidins, also present in berries and grapes, have
  already been identified as topoisomerase inhibitors;(15, 43, 44) thus, a contribution
  of such structures to the effects seen here might also be of relevance.
- In summary, our data identified a C3G-rich blackberry extract as a potent suppressor
  of topoisomerase activity in vitro, interfering with classical topoisomerase poisons
  thus leading to the protection of DNA.
- Furthermore, the blackberry extract suppresses DNA complex formation by topoisomerase
  poisons in HT29 cells.
- To estimate a possible relevance of the detected DNA-protecting properties of the
  C3G-rich blackberry under in vivo conditions, their bioavailability must be taken
  into account.
- Studies in 2006 by Kahle et al.
- on the bioavailability of a blueberry extract for ileostomy patients indicated that,
  depending on the sugar moiety of the anthocyanins, up to 85% could be determined
  in the ileostomy bags and, therefore, could reach the colon.
- (45) Assuming a consumption of 200 g of blackberries with an anthocyanin content
  of ∼50 mg of total anthocyanins in 100 g (fresh weight),(46) a local concentration
  in the gastrointestinal tract comparable to the bioactive concentrations applied
  here is achievable.
- Thus, a relevance of the biological activity of the blackberry extract detected
  here under in vivo conditions seems to be reasonable.
- In the case of coapplication with therapeutically applied topoisomerase poisons,
  as prescribed in several chemotherapeutic schemes, this could lead to a reduced
  effectiveness of the chemotherapeutics, at least locally in the gastrointestinal
  tract.
