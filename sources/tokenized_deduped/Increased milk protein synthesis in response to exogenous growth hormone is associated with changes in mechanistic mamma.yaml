- The objective of this study was to determine if increased milk protein synthesis
  observed in lactating dairy cows treated with growth hormone (GH) was associated
  with mechanistic (or mammalian) target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) regulation
  of downstream factors controlling nucleocytoplasmic export and translation of mRNA.
- To address this objective, biochemical indices of mammary growth and secretory activity
  and the abundance and phosphorylation status of mTORC1 pathway factors were measured
  in mammary tissues harvested from nonpregnant lactating dairy cows 6 d after treatment
  with a slow-release formulation of GH or saline (n = 4/group).
- Treatment with GH increased mammary parenchymal weight and total protein content
  and tended to increase ribosome number and cell size, whereas protein synthetic
  efficiency, capacity, and cell number were unchanged.
- Cellular abundance of the mTORC1 components mTOR and (phosphorylated) mTORSer2448
  increased, as did complex eukaryotic initiation factor 4E:eukaryotic initiation
  factor 4E binding protein 1 (eIF4E:4EBP1), whereas no change was observed for mTORC1-downstream
  targets 4EBP1, 4EBP1Ser65, p70/p85S6K and p70S6KThre389/p85S6KThre412.
- Changes in activation were not observed for any of the targets measured.
- These results indicate that GH treatment influences signaling to mTORC1 but not
  downstream targets involved in the nucleocytoplasmic export and translation of mRNA.
- Increased eIF4E:4EBP1 complex formation indicates involvement of the mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK) pathway.
- Abundance of MAPK pathway components eIF4E, eIF4ESer209, eIF4E:eIF4G complex, MAP
  kinase-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 (MKNK1), MKNK1Thr197202, and
  ribosomal protein S6 kinase, 90kDa, polypeptide 1 (RPS6KA1) increased significantly
  in response to GH, whereas relative activation of the proteins was unchanged.
- Expression of IGFBP3 and IGFBP5 increased, that of IGF1R decreased, and that of
  IGF1 remained unchanged in response to GH.
- PatSearch analysis of the milk caseins Î±S1-casein, Î±S2-casein, and Î²-casein,
  MAPK signaling target RPS6KA1, and proliferation gene IGFBP3 mRNA indicated that
  all contained putative eIF4E-sensitivity elements.
- In response to GH, these genes were all upregulated, suggesting that increased abundance
  of eIF4E and eIF4ESer209 plays a role in mediating their nucleocytoplasmic export.
- We propose that, in response to GH, the IGF1-IGF1R-MAPK signaling cascade regulates
  eIF4E-mediated nucleocytoplasmic export and translation of mRNA, whereas mTOR controls
  cell renewal, cell turnover, and rRNA transcription through an alternative signaling
  cascade.
