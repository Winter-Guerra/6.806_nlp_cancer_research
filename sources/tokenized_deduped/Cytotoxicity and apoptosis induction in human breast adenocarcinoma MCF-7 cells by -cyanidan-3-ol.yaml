- The objective of this study was to evaluate the cytotoxicity and possible signalling
  pathway implicated in (+)-cyanidan-3-ol (CD-3) induced apoptosis in the human breast
  adenocarcinoma cell line (MCF-7).
- The effects of CD-3 on cell proliferation of MCF-7 cells were evaluated by 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium
  bromide (MTT), sulforhodamine B (SRB) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assays.
- Cell apoptosis was detected by Hoechst 33258 (HO) and acridine orange/ethylene dibromide
  (AO/EB) staining and DNA fragmentation analysis.
- The expressions of apoptosis-related genes were assessed by RT-PCR and ELISA.
- Our data revealed that CD-3 induced MCF-7 cell death in a dose-dependent manner.
- Marked changes in apoptotic morphology was clearly observed after CD-3 treatment.
- CD-3 induced cell death was considered to be apoptotic by observing the typical
  apoptotic morphological change under fluorescent microscopy and DNA fragmentation
  assays.
- The induction of apoptosis is correlated with the increased mRNA expressions of
  p53, Bax, and caspase-3, -7, -8 and -9 and decreased mRNA expressions of bcl-2.
- Subsequently, CD-3 decreased the mRNA expressions of mdm2, p65, c-jun, c-fos in
  MCF-7 cells.
- The protein levels of p53, Bax, and caspase-3 were increased, whereas, that of p65,
  c-jun and Bcl-2 were decreased in MCF-7 cells on CD-3 treatment.
- These results clearly demonstrated that CD-3 effectively induced growth inhibition
  and apoptosis in MCF-7 cells.
