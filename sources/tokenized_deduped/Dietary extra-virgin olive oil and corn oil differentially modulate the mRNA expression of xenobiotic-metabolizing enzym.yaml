- High extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO) and corn oil diets differentially modulate experimental
  mammary carcinogenesis.
- We have investigated their influence on the initiation stage through the modulation
  of the expression of xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes (XMEs) in the liver and the
  mammary gland.
- Female Spragueâ€“Dawley rats were fed a low-fat (LF), high corn oil (HCO), or high
  EVOO (HOO) diet from weaning and gavaged with 7,12-dimethylbenz(_a_)anthracene (DMBA).
- The HCO diet increased the mRNA levels of the phase I enzymes CYP1A1, CYP1A2 and,
  to a lesser extent, CYP1B1, in the liver.
- The Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) seemed to be involved in this upregulated CYP1
  expression.
- However, a slight trend toward an increase in the mRNA levels of the phase II enzymes
  GSTP1 and NQO1 was observed with the HOO diet.
- At least in the case of GSTP1, this effect was linked to an increased Nrf2 transactivation
  activity.
- This different regulation of the XMEs expression led, in the case of the HCO diet,
  to a balance between the production of active carcinogenic compounds and their inactivation
  tilted toward phase I, which would stimulate DMBA-induced cancer initiation, whereas
  the HOO diet was associated with a slower phase I metabolism accompanied by a faster
  phase II detoxification, thus reducing the output of the active compounds to the
  target tissues.
- In the mammary gland, the differential effects of diets may be conditioned by the
  state of cell differentiation, sexual maturity, and hormone metabolism.
