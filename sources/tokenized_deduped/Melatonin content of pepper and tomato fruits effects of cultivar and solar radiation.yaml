- We evaluated the effect of cultivar and solar radiation on the melatonin content
  of _Capsicum annuum_ (pepper) and _Solanum lycopersicum_ (tomato) fruits.
- The melatonin content of red pepper fruits ranged from 31 to 93 ng g−1 (dry weight).
- The melatonin content of tomato ranged from 7.5 to 250 ng g−1 (dry weight).
- We also studied the effect of ripeness on melatonin content and identified one group
  of pepper cultivars in which the melatonin content increased as the fruit ripened
  and another in which it decreased as the fruit ripened.
- Under shade conditions, the melatonin content in most of tomato cultivars tended
  to increase (up to 135%), whereas that of most pepper cultivars decreased (to 64%).
- Overall, the results also demonstrated that the melatonin content of the fruits
  was not related to carbon fluxes from leaves.
