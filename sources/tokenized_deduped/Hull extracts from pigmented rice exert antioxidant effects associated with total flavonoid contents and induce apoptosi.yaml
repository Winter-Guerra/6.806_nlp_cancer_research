- 'Keywords: rice, flavonoid, antioxidant, chemoprevention, apoptosis Introduction
  Considerable interest exists for development of bioactive materials capable of preventing
  cancer.'
- Naturally occurring phenolic compounds are an attractive material for cancer chemoprevention.
- Agricultural residues have become the focus of an increasing number of studies aimed
  at identification of natural sources of bioactive phenolic compounds (1).
- The bran and hull of rice (Oryza sativa L.) are considered as especially promising
  sources of phenolic antioxidants (2).
- Phenolic compounds present in rice bran and hull have been shown to protect cells
  against oxidative injury (3), inhibit lipid peroxidation (4), and have both anti-
  inflammatory and anti-tumor properties (5,6).
- While it is believed that rice bran and hull may serve as sources of chemopreventive
  compounds for human health, efficiencies of contained compounds differ by rice variety
  and color.
- Pigmented rice has a greater antioxidant activity than white and brown rice (7,8).
- However, little information is available regarding the variability of pigmented
  rice residues for anti-cancer activities.
- Herein, bran and hull methanol extracts from 4 rice varieties with different seed
  coat colors were obtained and compared for antioxidant and anti-cancer activities.
- Possible mechanisms by which rice extracts induce apoptosis in cancer cells were
  also examined.
- Materials and Methods Chemicals and plastics z-VAD-fmk (FK009) and antibodies specific
  to cytochrome c, Bax, Bcl-2, HSP60, and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) were purchased
  from MP Biomedicals (Santa Ana, CA, USA) and Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz,
  CA, USA), respectively.

- otherwise specified, all other chemicals and culture plastics were purchased from
  Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA) and Becton-Dickinson (Franklin Lakes, NJ,
  USA), respectively.
- Plant materials Rice bran and hull extracts were prepared from three Korean japonica
  bred cultivars including Ilpum- bye (ILB, light brown rice), Heugjinju-bye (HEB,
  black rice), and Jeogjinju-bye (JEB, red rice), and one japonica weedy rice, WD-3
  (purple rice).
- Rice was cultivated in an experimental field located at Chonbuk National University
  in June of 2012 and collected at the fully ripe grain stage to obtain fresh seeds.
- Preparation of rice bran and hull methanol extracts Bran and hull were manually
  separated from grains of each variety and ground in a mill using roll mill (Single
  type stainless roller; Shinpoong Eng., Ltd., Gwangju, Korea) to pass through a 150-mech
  sieve.
- Next, rice bran or hull (20 g per sample) was mixed with 200 mL of absolute methanol
  and shaken at 150×g for 24 h in an incubator (LSI-3016R; Daihan Labtech India Pvt.,
  Ltd., Namyangju, Korea) at 50 oC.
- Collected extracts were concentrated with a rotary evaporator (B465; Buchi, Switzerland)
  and lyophilized using a freezing drier (FDS8508; ilShinBioBase, Yangju, Korea) to
  dryness.
- Extraction yields of bran and hull are shown in Table 1.
- Determination of total phenolic contents (TPC) and total flavonoidic contents (TFC)
  TPC values were determined based on the Folin-Ciocalteu reaction using gallic acid
  as a standard (9) and expressed as gallic acid equivalents (GAE) in mg/g of bran
  or hull (dry weight, DW).
- TFC values were quantified using the spectrophoto- metric method as previously described
  (10).
- TFC values were expressed as catechin equivalents (CE) in mg/g of bran or hull extracts
  (DW).
- Measurement of the reducing power and the DPPH radical scavenging activity The reducing
  power of rice extracts was measured according to previous methods (11).
- Rice samples (200 µg of each extract) were mixed with 2.5 mL of a 0.2 M Na 2HPO
  4 buffer (pH 6.6) followed by serial addition of 2.5 mL of 1% K 2Fe(CN) 6.
- Mixtures were incubated at 50 oC for 20 min and centrifuged (Combi-408; Hanil Science
  Ins., Incheon, Korea) at 3,500×g for 10 min after addition of 2.5 mL of 10% TCA.
- The supernatant (2.5 mL) was mixed with 5 mL of H 2O and 0.5 mL of 0.1% FeCl 3 and
  the absorbance was read at 700 nm using a spectrophotometer (DU530; Beckman, Germany).
- The reducing power of rice samples was expressed as an activity (%) relative to
  the activity of 100 µg of ascorbic acid.
- The DPPH radical scavenging activity was analyzed as previously described (12).
- Briefly, 200 µg of each extract was mixed with 2 mL of a 0.1 mM DPPH-ethanol solution
  and 1 mL of a 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4).
- After 30 min of incubation at 25 oC, the absorbance was measured at 517 nm.
- Cell cultures and treatment This study used the human breast cancer cell line MCF-7,
  the mouse and human originated-melanoma cell lines B16F10 and M-3, and the human
  oral cancer cell line YD-38.
- Cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 100 IU/mL of penicillin
  G and 100 µg/mL of streptomycin.
- Cells were treated with each of the extracts at concentrations of 0-200 µg/mL for
  0-48 h in the presence and absence of 50 µM z- VAD-fmk or 2 mM 4-phenylbutyric acid
  (PBA).
- Cells were treated with quercetin (0-200 µM) under the same conditions for comparison
  because quercetin is a ubiquitous bioactive flavonoid exhibiting antioxidant and
  anti-cancer activities (13,14).
- Rice extracts and quercetin were dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) before use
  and the final DMSO concentration did not exceed 0.5% (v/v) in any experiment.
- Control cells in all experiments contained 0.5% DMSO, which did not affect the cell
  viability.
- Measurement of the cell viability To evaluate the viability of cells exposed to
  rice extracts, water-soluble MTT was used as previously described (13).
- The absorbance was measured at 560 nm using a SpectraCount ELISA reader (Packard
  Instrument Co., Downers Glove, IL, USA) and results were recorded as % viability.
- Detection of apoptosis All experiments to detect apoptotic death were performed
  as previously described (13).
- Agarose gel electrophoresis was first used to detect formation of DNA ladders in
  cells treated with hull extracts.
- Next, flow cytometric analysis was used after staining cells with propidium iodide
  (PI) to determine the population of cells in the sub-G 1 phase, which was interpreted
  as indicative of apoptosis.
- Induction of DNA fragmentation was detected using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated
  dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assays followed by observation under a fluorescence
  microscope (Axioskop 2; Carl Zeiss, Göttingen, Germany).
- In addition, some cells were stained with annexin V-FITC and 0.5 µg/mL of 4'-6-diamidino-2-
  phenylindole (DAPI) to detect apoptotic and necrotic cells.
- Measurement of the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) Cells (2×10 6 cells/mL)
  were stained with 50 nM 3,3'-dihexyloxa-carbocyanine iodide (DiOC 6) for 20 min
  at 37 oC.
- The fluorescence related to MMP was measured using a FACSCalibur system and analyzed
  using WinMDI 2.9 software.

  blot analysis Cytosolic and mitochondrial pellets from rice extract-exposed cells
  were prepared as previously described (15).
- Equal amounts (20 µg) of protein from each sample were analyzed using 12-15% SDS-PAGE
  and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes.
- After reaction with primary and secondary antibodies, blots were developed using
  enhanced chemiluminescence followed by exposure to X-ray film.
- Data from triplicate experiments were quantified by densitometry (Universal Hood
  II; Bio- Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) after normalization of bands to β-actin (for cytosolic
  lysates) or HSP60 (for mitochondrial fractions).
- Statistical analysis All data were expressed as the mean ±standard deviation (SD)
  of three independent experiments.
- Unless otherwise specified, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA; SPSS, version 12.0;
  IBM, Armonk, NY, USA) followed by Scheffe’s test were used for multiple comparisons.
- A Student’s t-test was used for a simple two- group comparison.
- A value of p&lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant.
- Results and Discussion Antioxidant activity, TPC, and TFC values were mostly higher
  in pigmented rice than in light-brown rice Extraction yields, TPC and TFC values,
  and antioxidant activities of rice bran and hull extracts are shown in Table 1.
- Extraction yields of rice bran were approximately 5 times greater than for hulls.
- The pigmented rice varieties HEB and WD-3 showed higher TPC and TFC values than
  ILB.
- Both bran and hull extracts from HEB had the highest TFC values, followed by JEB,
  WD-3, and ILB.
- The TFC value was closely associated with the reducing power of these rice extracts.
- HEB also exhibited a potent reducing power.
- Pigmented rice extracts scavenged DPPH radicals more than ILB extracts.
- Pigmented rice bran has been reported to have a higher antioxidant activity than
  rice bran of brown color (7).
- The antioxidant and chemopreventive potentials of extracts from natural sources
  can be correlated with phenolic contents (6,8).
- Extracts from pigmented rice showed significantly (p&lt;0.05) higher TPC and TFC
  values and DPPH radical scavenging activities and reducing powers than ILB extracts.
- Isovitexin, catechin derivatives, and cinnamic and benzoic acid derivatives were
  probably responsible for the antioxidant activities of rice bran and hull, based
  on previous findings for bioactive compounds present in rice bran and hull extracts
  (16).
- Rice hull extracts mediate cytotoxicity of cancer cells more than bran extracts
  via induction of apoptosis All tested hull extracts reduced cell viability in both
  a dose and time-dependent manner (data not shown).
- The concentration needed to achieve a 50% decrease in the viability (IC 50) of MCF-7
  cells revealed that HEB was the most potent extract (103 µg/mL), followed by ILB,
  JEB, and WD-3 (Fig.
- 1A).
- Treatment with quercetin for 48 h also decreased cell viability with an IC 50 value
  of 71 µM.

- than bran extracts.
- HEB hull extracts suppressed the viability of B16F10, M-3, and YD-38 cancer cells
  (Fig.
- 1B).
- Other hull extracts also reduced the viability of melanoma and oral cancer cells,
  although the effects were not as effective as for HEB (data not shown).
- Cell death is commonly classified as apoptosis, pyknosis, or necrosis based on morphological
  characteristics (17).
- The mode of cell death after treatment with hull extracts at a concentration of
  200 µg/mL was determined.
- Evidence of morphological changes in MCF-7 cells with the appearance of cell shrinkage
  and nuclear condensation induced by all hull extracts is shown in Fig.
- 2A.
- These changes were more prominent in the presence of HEB and ILB extracts than for
  JEB and WD-3 extracts.
- The sub-G 1 population of cells was also significantly (p&lt;0.01) higher following
  treatment with the HEB extract than for JEB and WD-3 extracts (Fig.
- 2B).
- Agarose gel electrophoresis showed a dose-dependent increase in DNA ladders in cells
  after treatment with the HEB extract for 48 h (Fig.
- 2C).
- Treatment with 200 µg/mL of the HEB extract for 24 h increased the proportion of
  positively TUNEL stained M-3 cells (Fig.
- 2D, 2E).
- Further, the HEB extract induced apoptotic death in B16F10 cells based on nuclear
  condensation and an increase in the number of annexin-V stained cells (Fig.
- 2F).
- Thus, hull extract-mediated cell death was probably due to apoptosis.

  (F) in the presence of 2 mM PBA before an MTT assay and TUNEL staining.
- In all experiments, the percentage in the groups treated with rice extracts was
  significantly (p&lt;0.05) different from the percentage of untreated control cells.
- '#p&lt;0.05 and ##p&lt;0.01 indicate significant differences between experiments.'
- NS, not significant Caspase-dependent and mitochondrial-mediated pathways were associated
  with hull extract-mediated apoptosis in MCF-7 cells The mechanisms involved in apoptosis
  can be distinguished as caspase-dependent or independent (18).
- z-VAD-fmk (50 µM) significantly (p&lt;0.05) restored the decrease in cell viability
  due to treatment with 200 µg/mL of ILB, HEB, or JEB extracts, but not with the WD-3
  extract (Fig.
- 3A).
- Similarly, hull extract and quercetin- mediated increases in numbers of TUNEL positive
  cells were diminished by the pan-caspase inhibitor (Fig.
- 3B, 3C), suggesting an association with caspase-dependent apoptosis.
- However, treatment of MCF-7 cells with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress inhibitor
  PBA (2 mM) did not suppress the reduction in cell viability induced by the HEB extract
  (Fig.
- 3D), whereas PBA significantly (p&lt;0.05) rescued the cell viability and DNA fragmentation
  induced by the WD-3 extract (Fig.
- 3E).
- The quercetin- induced cell viability reduction in MCF-7 cells was also significantly
  (p&lt;0.01) inhibited by treatment with PBA (Fig.
- 3F).
- Mechanisms by which hull extracts induced apoptosis in MCF-7 cells differed according
  to rice variety and color.
- WD-3-mediated apoptosis was associated with ER stress more than with caspase activation.
- Mitochondria play a key role in induction of apoptosis and are involved in caspase-dependent
  and/or ER stress- mediated apoptosis (18,19).
- The effects of hull extracts on loss of MMP, a classic apoptotic event, in MCF-7
  cells were examined.
- In addition to quercetin, all extracts caused a loss of MMP from cells, with the
  HEB extract exhibiting the most potent effect (Fig.
- 4A).
- Loss of MMP showing an HEB-mediated left-shift of the DiOC 6 signal is shown in
  Fig.
- 4B.
- Hull extracts also reduced levels of mitochondrial Bcl-2 and increased levels of
  Bax in MCF-7 cells (Fig.
- 4C).
- Decreases in mitochondrial cytochrome c and AIF levels and increases in the cytosol
  were observed after treatment with each hull extract at 200 µg/mL for 24 h (Fig.
- 4C, 4D).
- In addition, HEB extract treatment led to a significant (p&lt;0.001) change in levels
  of mitochondrial pro-apoptotic proteins, compared with controls (Fig.
- 4E, 4F).
- Consequently, hull extract-mediated apoptosis in MCF-7 cells was closely associated
  with mitochondria- mediated caspase activation.
- TPC and TFC values in rice bran and hull extracts were apparently related to antioxidant
  activities.
- However, the anti-cancer activities of extracts were not directly correlated with
  TPC or TFC values.
- Despite having significantly (p&lt;0.05) lower TPC and TFC values, compared with
  controls, the ILB extract had an activity similar to the HEB extract, the most potent
  inducer of apoptotic death of the tested extracts.
- Thus, it is likely that the biological activities of 246 Baek et al.

- Pigmented rice extracts exhibited higher antioxidant activities than light-brown
  rice, whereas hull extracts exerted greater anti-cancer activities than bran extracts.
- Pigmented rice bran and hulls are attractive agricultural residues due to antioxidant
  and anti-cancer activities.
