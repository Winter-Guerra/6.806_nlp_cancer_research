- The stability of the saponifiable and unsaponifiable fractions of avocado oil, under
  a drastic heating treatment, was studied and compared to that of olive oil.
- Avocado and olive oil were characterised and compared at time 0 h and after different
  times of heating process (180 °C).
- "PUFA/SFA (0.61 at _t_ = 0) and Ï\x89-6/Ï\x89-3 (14.05 at _t_ = 0) were higher in
  avocado oil than in olive oil during the whole experiment."
- Avocado oil was richer than olive oil in total phytosterols at time 0 h (339.64;
  228.27 mg/100 g) and at 9 h (270.44; 210.30 mg/100 g) of heating.
- TBARs was higher in olive oil after 3 h, reaching the maximum values in both oils
  at 6 h of heating treatment.
- Vitamin E was higher in olive oil (35.52 vs. 24.5 mg/100 g) and it disappeared earlier
  in avocado oil (at 4 vs. 5 h).
- The stability of avocado oil was similar to that of olive oil.
