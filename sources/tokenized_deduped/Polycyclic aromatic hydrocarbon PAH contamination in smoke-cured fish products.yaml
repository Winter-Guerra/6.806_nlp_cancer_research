- In this study, 108 fish samples of smoke cured fish _Sardinella aurita_ (sardines/herrings)
  collected from 12 major fishing communities along the coastal belt of Ghana were
  extracted with Soxhlet apparatus using dichloromethane (DCM), and analyzed for sixteen
  polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) using the GC/MS (Varian 3800 GC system with
  8400 auto-sampler) to determine levels, distribution and the characterization of
  their sources.
- The mean total PAHs in the smoked sardines from the various communities ranged from
  510.59 Î¼g/kg to 1461.79 Î¼g/kg for all seasons with a mean value of 716.84 Î¼g/kg.
- The benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) had a maximum mean level of 73.78 Î¼g/kg.
- The unit risk of carcinogenic PAHs for benzo[a]pyrene, chrysene, dibenz[a,h]anthracene,
  benzo[a]anthracene, benzo[k]fluoranthene, benzo[b]fluoranthene, and indenol[1,2,3-cd]pyrene
  associated with oral ingestion of smoked sardine was calculated to be 6.1 × 10−7
  for adults and 1.6 × 10−7 for children.
- There is a significant correlation between the fish lipid content and the total
  PAH levels.
- The average lipid content of the smoked sardine samples collected varied among the
  various fishing seasons (3 seasons) in Ghana.
- A significantly high accumulation of PAHs was found in the smoke-cured fish as compared
  to the non-smoke-cured fish control samples, which showed PAH levels that were below
  detection (0.10-2.0 Î¼g/kg).
- This study highlights the increased danger of consuming smoke-cured fish in Ghana
  as some of the PAHs are known to be carcinogenic.
- These results indicate that there is a need to find alternative ways of curing fish
  other than the traditional smoking process.
