- Recent studies suggest health benefits including protection from cancer after eating
  fermented foods such as probiotic yogurt, though the mechanisms are not well understood.
- 'Here we tested mechanistic hypotheses using two different animal models: the first
  model studied development of mammary cancer when eating a Westernized diet, and
  the second studied animals with a genetic predilection to breast cancer.'
- For the first model, outbred Swiss mice were fed a Westernized chow putting them
  at increased risk for development of mammary tumors.
- In this Westernized diet model, mammary carcinogenesis was inhibited by routine
  exposure to _Lactobacillus reuteri_ ATCC-PTA-6475 in drinking water.
- The second model was FVB strain erbB2 (HER2) mutant mice, genetically susceptible
  to mammary tumors mimicking breast cancers in humans, being fed a regular (non-Westernized)
  chow diet.
- We found that oral supplement with these purified lactic acid bacteria alone was
  sufficient to inhibit features of mammary neoplasia in both models.
- The protective mechanism was determined to be microbially-triggered CD4+CD25+ lymphocytes.
- When isolated and transplanted into other subjects, these _L.
- reuteri_-stimulated lymphocytes were sufficient to convey transplantable anti-cancer
  protection in the cell recipient animals.
- These data demonstrate that host immune responses to environmental microbes significantly
  impact and inhibit cancer progression in distal tissues such as mammary glands,
  even in genetically susceptible mice.
- This leads us to conclude that consuming fermentative microbes such as _L.
- reuteri_ may offer a tractable public health approach to help counteract the accumulated
  dietary and genetic carcinogenic events integral in the Westernized diet and lifestyle.
- Breast cancer is the most prevalent type of cancer in women worldwide and a leading
  cause of neoplasia-associated mortality.
- '[1] Although genetic predisposition plays a role, accumulating epidemiological
  and experimental data also link an unhealthy diet and obesity with postmenopausal
  mammary cancer occurrence and growth.'
- '[1-6] The mechanisms explaining this connection are largely unknown.'
- Several lines of evidence, however, suggest that inter-related metabolic and inflammatory
  pathways may be involved.
- Specifically, altered hormonal pathways involving estrogens, insulin and insulin
  growth factor, imbalances in the expression of adipokines such as leptin and adiponectin
  and obesity-associated proinflammatory signaling have all been shown to promote
  mammary tumorigenesis.
- '[1, 4-10] Interestingly, data from several elegant experiments using high-fat diet-fed
  mice indicate that obesity-associated inflammation could promote mammary cancer
  independently from ovarian hormones,[8, 10] insulin[6] and adipokine effects.'
- '[9] Taken together these data suggest that immune system-related events may hold
  the key trigger role in the complex interplay between growth factors, hormones and
  adipokine signaling, which connects diet and obesity with mammary carcinogenesis.'
- '[11] Despite the progress made in identifying the mechanisms underlying the obesity-mammary
  cancer associations, the question "how do we block the adverse effects of obesity
  on postmenopausal breast cancer?"'
- has been recently characterized as urgent.
- '[11]


  In an earlier series of experiments we have shown that inflammatory signals from
  bacteria colonizing the gut can trigger mammary carcinogenesis in mice.'
- '[12-14] Specifically, anti-inflammatory therapies including anti-tumor necrosis
  factor (TNF)-alpha treatments, and adoptive cell transfer using gut-bacteria-activated
  regulatory T (Treg) cells are able to block tumor-promoting effects in both ApcMin/+
  and MMTV-HER2/neu mouse model.'
- '[12-14] Murine models exhibiting mutations in the erbB2 gene are widely used to
  mimic neoplastic processes seen in ∼30% of patients with breast cancer.'
- '[15] Interestingly, recent evidence from women with estrogen-receptor-negative
  breast cancer shows that tumor-infiltrating Treg are associated with a more favorable
  clinical outcome.'
- '[16]


  In a more recent series of experiments we discovered that feeding mice with the
  edible probiotic bacterium _Lactobacillus reuteri (L. reuteri)_ exerts unexpected
  effects in the integument, namely that _L.'
- reuteri-_fed mice have radiant fur with increased anagenic hair follicles.
- '[17] In these studies _L.'
- reuteri_ was chosen due to broad relevancy by colonizing many mammalian species,
  the precedent for _L.
- reuteri_ to treat or prevent human diseases such as diarrhea in children, the well-established
  precedent in scientific literature using _L.
- reuteri_ as a model probiotic organism, that _L.
- reuteri_ ATCC-PTA-6475 was originally isolated from human milk, previously demonstrated
  efficacy in inflammatory diseases in mouse models, in particular this "anti-inflammatory"
  isolate suited our immune system study goals, and _L.
- reuteri_ is very easy to cultivate and dose to animals.
- In a separate line of experiments we find that _L.
- reuteri_ rescues mice from diet-induced obesity and fat pathology _via_ CD4+Foxp3+CD25+
  regulatory T (Treg) cell-associated immunomodulatory effects.
- '[18] Our recent findings regarding the effects of _L.'
- reuteri_ upon Treg cells are in line with previous studies showing that _L.
- reuteri_ stimulates the development of host protective regulatory-T cells _in vitro_
  as well as _in vivo_.
- '[19-21] These data taken together with previous evidence that dietary lactic acid
  bacteria could lower the risk of breast cancer in women,[22, 23] and also suppress
  mammary cancer development in mice through immune-system regulatory events,[24-26]
  led us to test the effects of _L.'
- reuteri_ consumption in mouse models of mammary cancer.
- In the present study, using first a high-fat diet-associated outbred mouse, and
  then a classical, diet-unrelated genetically engineered MMTV-HER2/neu mouse model
  of mammary cancer, we found that eating purified lactic acid bacteria alone was
  sufficient to delay onset of preneoplastic or neoplastic features in both models.
- The protective mechanism involved microbially triggered antigen activated CD4+CD25+
  cells that were sufficient to bestow transplantable anti-cancer protection to recipient
  host MMTV-HER2/neu mice.
- These data demonstrate that host immune responses to environmental microbes significantly
  impact cancer progression in distal nonintestinal tissues.
- In these studies, modulation of the tumor micro-environment by regulating systemic
  immune cell responses at the whole organism level was found to counteract dietary
  or genetic predisposition to cancer.
- Outbred CD-1 mice (Charles River; Wilmington, MA), and inbred _MMTV-neu (HER2)_
  FVB strain mice (Jackson Labs, Bar Harbor, ME), were housed and handled in Association
  for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC)-accredited facilities
  with diets, experimental methods, and housing as specifically approved by the Institutional
  Animal Care and Use Committee.
- The MIT CAC (IACUC) specifically approved the studies as well as the housing and
  handling of these animals.
- For studies using outbred mice, the experimental design was to expose mice to diets
  starting at age = 8 weeks, and then continue the treatment for 12 weeks until euthanasia
  using carbon dioxide overdose at 5 months of age, unless otherwise specified.
- Each experiment included 5-15 animals per group with one replicate experiment.
- Mammary tissues were collected upon necropsy and then examined histologically.
- For experiments using HER2 mice, age-matched female HER2/neu mutant mice were either
  untreated or had their water continuously supplemented with _L.
- reuteri_ beginning at 8 weeks of age.
- Mice were euthanized when animals reached 1 year of age, or earlier if the total
  cumulative tumor burden on the animal reached 2 cm in diameter.
- In studies using adoptive cell transfer, otherwise untreated 6-month-old female
  HER2 mice with pre-existing tumor burden where randomly subdivided into treatment
  groups that received cell transplant injections as described in detail below.
- 'Outbred Swiss mice were placed on experimental diets starting at 8 weeks of age:
  control AIN-76A (Harlan-Teklad Madison WI), and a Westernized diet with high fat
  and low fiber with substandard levels of Vitamin D (TD.96096; Harlan-Teklad), consumed
  until euthanasia at 20 weeks of age.'
- In a separate set of studies, FVB strain HER2 transgenic mice and FVB strain wt
  cell donor animals received a standard animal facility mouse chow (Pro Lab RMH 3000;
  Purina, Richmond IN).
- Subsets of these Swiss or FVB mice received in their drinking water an anti-inflammatory
  strain of _Lactobacillus reuteri_ ATCC-PTA-6475 cultivated as described elsewhere,[17,
  27] with live organisms supplied at a starting dosage of 3.5 × 105 organisms/mouse/day
  in drinking water.
- Live bacterial counts in water bottles were calculated to be 1.4 × 106 colony forming
  units (CFU) per mouse after 24 hr, 4.1 × 105 CFU at 48 hr, and 1.1 × 105 CFU at
  72 hr, when quantified as described in detail below.
- Control mice received regular drinking water.
- Fresh drinking water for both groups of animals was replaced twice weekly throughout
  the experiments.
- Levels of _L.
- reuteri_ were undetectably low in untreated animals using PCR as described below.
- _Lactobacillus reuteri_ was cultivated as described in previous studies.
- '[17, 27] To ascertain counts of live organisms in drinking water per day, log phase
  cultures were diluted to 0.05 OD and 100 µL plated for overnight growth on blood
  agar plates (BAP).'
- Overnight cultures were collected into sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and
  the optical density (OD) was measured.
- The OD of the preparation was adjusted to 1.0 and measured once again for confirmation.
- Then 1 mL of suspension was added to five separate bottles containing 480 mL of
  sterile water each and allowed to incubate overnight.
- The following morning the contents were mixed by gentle inversion and 1 mL was diluted
  100-fold in sterile water; 50 µL of this dilution were plated at a frequency of
  3 BAP per bottle.
- Again bottles were allowed to stand overnight and another 1 mL sample taken from
  them each, then diluted 100-fold and plated.
- This process was repeated over 4 days.
- Colonies were counted 48 hr after plating due to small colony size.
- Counts were averaged across and between bottles per day and number of total CFU
  in drinking water was extrapolated based on dilution fold and total water volume.
- Feces were collected from animals prior to _L.
- reuteri_ treatment as well as at time of necropsy to gauge its presence post-treatment
  in comparison with baseline levels of the bacteria.
- DNA was extracted using the QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit from Qiagen.
- The extraction was performed as per the manufacturer's specifications with the exemption
  of an added fecal dissociation step during the resuspension where sterile beads
  were added to the samples and subsequently placed in a Bullet Blender (New England
  Biogroup) for more efficient sample homogenization.
- _L.
- reuteri_ specific quantitative PCRs were performed utilizing primers reported by
  Dommels _et al_.
- '[28] on an Applied Biosystems 7500 real-time PCR machine at a final concentration
  of 0.4 µM each.'
- Assays were conducted in 25 µL volumes containing 12.5 µL SYBR Select Master Mix
  (Applied Biosystems).
- DNA concentrations were measured utilizing a Thermo Science Nanodrop 2000C and 100
  ng of DNA were loaded per reaction.
- Amplification was performed verbatim as previously specified[28] and absolute quantifications
  were performed by comparison to a dilution series (data not shown).
- Mice were treated with anti-CD25 antibody (clone PC-61; Bio- Express, West Lebanon,
  NH) at 150 μg per mouse intraperitoneally 3× weekly for 12 weeks starting a 8-weeks-of-age.
- Treated mice were compared to mice receiving sham isotype antibody alone.
- Depletion of CD25+ cells was confirmed by undetectably low fractions of CD25+ cells
  in spleens of mice treated with anti-CD25 antibody compared to sham-treated controls
  using flow cytometry.
- Depletion was confirmed by absence of Foxp3+ cells in spleen.
- CD4+ lymphocytes isolated from _wild type_ FVB strain female mice using magnetic
  beads (Dynal/Invitrogen; Carlsbad CA) are sorted by hi-speed flow cytometry (MoFlow2)
  to first obtain purified populations of CD4+ lymphocytes and determined to be ∼96%
  pure as previously described elsewhere.
- '[14] Syngeneic FVB strain MMTV-neu transgenic recipient mice were then injected
  intraperitoneally with 3 × 105 CD4+ CD45RBloCD25+ cells determined to be ∼96% pure
  as previously described elsewhere.'
- '[14]




  For histologic evaluation, formalin-fixed tissues were embedded in paraffin, cut
  at 5 μm, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin.'
- Lesions were analyzed and quantified by a pathologist blinded to sample identity.
- 'Hyperplastic and preneoplastic lesions in the mammary gland of aged Swiss mice
  were scored on a 0-6 scale according to the following scheme: 0: normal; 1: Focal,
  multifocal or diffuse hyperplasia, low grade without atypia; 2: Focal, multifocal
  or diffuse hyperplasia, intermediate grade without atypia; 3: Focal, multifocal
  or diffuse hyperplasia, high grade without atypia; 4: Focal, multifocal or diffuse
  hyperplasia with mild atypia; 5: Focal, multifocal or diffuse hyperplasia with marked
  atypia; 6: Carcinoma _in situ_.'
- Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and morphometric assessment were as previously described.
- '[14] IHC-positive immune cells or pixels and toluidine-stained mast cells were
  counted in 20× or 40× images and results were recorded as number of cells or pixels
  per image.'
- Primary antibodies for IHC included rabbit polyclonal antibodies for β-catenin (ThermoFisher
  Scientific/Lab Vision, Fremont, CA), cleaved caspase-3, NFκ-B-p65 and c-Jun (Cell
  Signaling, Beverly, MA), Ki-67 (Cell Marque, Rocklin, CA), and a rat monoclonal
  antibody for Foxp3 (eBioscience, San Diego, CA) detection.
- Primary antibody binding was detected with goat anti-rabbit polymer HRP (ZytoChem
  Plus, Berlin, Germany) or biotinylated goat anti-rat IgG (Serotec, Oxford, UK).
- Heat-induced antigen retrieval was performed with citrate buffer, pH 6, for β-catenin,
  cleaved caspase-3, NFκ-B-p65 and c-Jun or with EDTA buffer, pH 8, for ki-67 and
  Foxp-3.
- The ImageJ image processing and analysis program (NIH, Bethesda, MD) was used for
  all quantitative histomorphometry assessments.
- The Mann-Whitney U test was used for body weight, and histomorphometry.
- Mammary tumor volume and multiplicity was evaluated using unpaired student _T_ test.
- A _p_ value &lt; 0.05 was statistically significant.
- Obesity-inducing diets promote mammary cancer in both humans and mice.
- '[1-6] To recapitulate these observations we fed genetically outbred Swiss female
  mice an _ad libitum_ diet of New Westernized diet (NWD) chow mimicking typical human
  "fast food"-style diets that are high in fat and sugar, and low in fiber and vitamins
  B and D. We examined the mammary tissues of the 5-month-old mice when fed continuously
  on Western (_N_ = 10 animals) and control (_N_ = 10 animals) diets starting at age
  = 8 weeks, in order to determine the frequency and spectrum of diet-induced mammary
  pathology.'
- We found that the mammary ducts and terminal duct lobular units of Westernized chow-fed
  mice had increased focal, multifocal, or diffuse hyperplastic lesions of varying
  severity.
- Hyperplastic glands often showed lateral budding, epithelial cell atypia, increased
  mitotic figures and intra-epithelial neoplasia (carcinoma _in situ_).
- Foci of hyperplastic alveoli resembling hyperplastic alveolar nodules (HAN) were
  also evident (Fig.
- 1).
- The evidence of proliferating cells with ki-67-specific immunohistochemistry confirmed
  the hyperproliferation of mammary glands in mice eating Western chow (Fig.
- 1).
- Using a semi-quantitative scoring system (as shown in Fig.
- 2_a_), we found that the mammary pathology score of Westernized chow-fed mice differed
  significantly (_p_ &lt; 0.001) from that of mice consuming control diet (Figs.
- 1 and 2_b_).
- Figure 1\.
- Effect of diet and _L.
- reuteri_ supplementation on mammary gland pathology of Swiss mice.
- Ducts (upper row) and the terminal duct lobular units (middle row) of westernized
  diet-fed mice have precancerous epithelial lesions.
- The mammary intraepithelial neoplasia cells fill the lumen of the duct and show
  increased mitoses, and marked pleomorphism.
- The lesion in mammary alveoli is an atypical lobule showing histological features
  of the "hyperplastic alveolar nodules" such as atypical cells, an intermediate grade
  of anisokaryosis and light-brown stained lipid pigments.
- Compare with normal histology of mammary glands from mice consuming control diet
  or westernized-diet+_L.
- reuteri_.
- The westernized diet-induced hyperproliferative state of mammary gland epithelium
  can be better appreciated with ki-67 specific immunohistochemistry.
- Ki-67+ proliferating cell nuclei are numerous in contrast to control-diet or westernized-diet+L.

- (_e_) The mammary tumors show immunohistochemical evidence of abnormal β-catenin

- To examine the malignant potential of diet-associated mammary preneoplasia and early
  neoplasia found at Swiss mice at 5 months of age, we assessed the frequency of mammary
  tumors arising in these mice with the progression of age.
- We discovered 2-cm diameter mammary tumors (Fig.
- 2_c_) arising in two (2/6; 33%) of 1-year-old Swiss mice on Westernized chow, but
  none in their age-matched female Swiss mice consuming a control diet (0/20).
- Overt mammary tumors in these mice eating Western chow exhibited typical histopathology
  of high-grade glandular adenocarcinoma (Fig.
- 2_d_).
- In addition to traditional criteria of high mitotic index and cellular atypia, malignant
  phenotype of these tumors was further confirmed by immunohistochemistry profiles
  consistent with carcinoma (Fig.
- 2_e_).
- The neoplastic cells had an abnormal β-catenin staining pattern with diffuse cytoplasmic
  and occasional nuclear stabilization, indicative of dysregulation in the _wnt_ gene
  signaling pathway.
- Proliferating ki-67+ neoplastic cells were numerous throughout mammary tissue (Fig.
- 2_e_).
- It is widely known that intestinal microbes modulate host health through activities
  of CD4+ immune cells, at least in part through interleukin (Il)-6-dependent reciprocal
  functions of anti-inflammatory Foxp3+ regulatory (Treg) cells and proinflammatory
  T helper (Th) 17 cells.
- Based upon our previous observations involving inflammatory cells and cytokines
  in mouse models of cancer,[12-14] we examined critical cellular components of the
  immune system of the 5-month-old Westernized "fast food"-style Westernized diet-fed
  Swiss female mice.
- At this time-point of neoplastic initiation, we found that the mammary lymph nodes
  of NWD-fed mice had significantly fewer Foxp3+ cells compared to the mammary lymph
  nodes of mice consuming the control diet (Fig.
- 3).
- This result matches our previous findings regarding the effect of NWD on the mesenteric
  lymph node Treg cell population.
- In the NWD-fed female Swiss mice, a topographical association of Foxp3+ cells with
  abnormal mammary glands was not observed.
- Abnormal glands, however, were surrounded by significantly (_p_ &lt; 0.0002) increased
  numbers of mast cells, as previously shown in mammary carcinoma of humans and rodent
  models.
- '[29] Consequently, the number of mast cells in the abnormal mammary epithelium
  of Westernized chow-eating mice was significantly higher from that of control diet
  mice, accompanied by sparse Foxp3+ Treg cells (Fig.'
- 3).
- Figure 3\.
- The _L.
- reuteri_ anti-neoplastic effect correlates with restoration of control-level Treg
  and mast cell populations.
- Western-type diet induced lesions in the mammary gland correlate with a morphometrically
  assessed significant decrease of Foxp3+ in the mammary lymph nodes and significant
  increase of peri-glandular Toluidine Blue-stained mast cells.
- Dietary supplementation with _L.
- reuteri_ restores the immune cell populations along with mammary gland histology
  at the base-line control diet-matched levels.
- 'Foxp3-specific IHC: DAB chromogen, Hematoxylin counterstain.'
- 'Mast cells: Toluidine Blue stain.'
- Bars = 50 μm.
- Previous studies have shown that routine dietary intake of lactic acid bacteria
  may lower the risk of breast cancer in women,[22, 23] and also suppress mammary
  cancer development in mice.
- '[24-26] This led us to test the effects of _L.'
- reuteri_ consumption in this mouse model of mammary malignancy (_N_ = 12-15 animals
  per group).
- We found that hyperplastic and pre-neoplastic features were observed in significantly
  (_p_ &lt; 0.005) lower frequency in animals receiving purified _L.
- reuteri_ ATCC-PTA-6475[17, 27] when adding 3.5 × 105 organisms/mouse/day to their
  regular drinking water (Figs.
- 1 and 2_b_).
- _L.
- reuteri_-induced restoration of glandular epithelium coincided with a significant
  increase of mammary lymph node Foxp3+ cells and a significant reduction of mammary
  tissue mast cells to the base-line control-diet levels (Fig.
- 3).
- We next examined whether consumption of _L.
- reuteri_ may inhibit Western diet-induced obesity.
- Accumulating data specifically link Westernized diet-induced obesity with mammary
  cancer occurrence and growth.
- '[1-6] Existing data suggest that immune system-related events may hold the key
  trigger role in the complex interplay between growth factors, hormones and adipokine
  signaling, which connects high fat diet and obesity with mammary carcinogenesis.'
- '[11] We found that 5-month-old mice eating NWD and also consuming _L.'
- reuteri_ in drinking water were significantly leaner than those mice fed NWD alone
  (Supporting Information Fig.
- S1).
- We had previously found that while Swiss mice eating _L.
- reuteri_ were uniformly slender, their age-matched counterparts eating _L.
- reuteri_ and simultaneously treated with anti-CD25 antibody instead rapidly developed
  morbid obesity and profound abdominal fat pathology during the ensuing 3 months.
- '[18] Swiss mice eating _L.'
- reuteri_ also exhibited significantly increased anti-inflammatory Foxp3+ Treg cells
  and lower levels of IL-17 protein within lymph tissues draining the intestinal tract,
  along with higher levels of IL-10 protein and lower levels of IL-17 protein in serum,
  when compared with matched control mice.
- '[18] This suggested that host ability to recruit properly functioning anti-inflammatory
  Treg cells and resulting immune homeostasis is essential for protection from obesity.'
- Following this reasoning, we postulated that intestinal microbe-activated CD4+CD25+
  Treg cells may serve to connect obesity with risk for development of cancer in tissues
  such as mammary gland.
- Based upon our earlier work linking intestinal bacteria with mammary glands _via_
  recruitment of CD4+CD25+ immune cells,[13, 30] plus other studies showing dietary
  lactic acid bacteria suppress mammary cancer through immune-system regulatory events,[24-26]
  we hypothesized that lactic acid organisms such as _L.
- reuteri_ may protect from cancer by favorably biasing the immune system through
  induction of anti-inflammatory CD4+CD25+ Treg cells.
- We tested this using depletion of CD4+CD25+ cells _via_ systemic anti-CD25 antibody
  administration in _L.
- reuteri_-treated mice (_N_ = 6 animals).
- We found that anti-CD25 systemic treatment negated the beneficial effect of _L.
- reuteri,_ and resulted instead in increased mammary hyperplastic and preneoplastic
  lesions (Figs.
- 2_b_ and 4) with an abnormal mammary gland-associated accumulation (_p_ &lt; 0.002)
  of mast cells (Fig.
- 4).
- The latter mast cell accumulation effect was also observed in untreated Westernized
  diet-fed mice depleted of CD25+ cells and without _L.
- reuteri_ (Supporting Information Fig.
- S2).
- This result further supports the conclusion that the systemic CD25+ cell population
  inversely correlates with the mast cell accumulations in the mammary gland.
- In sum, the female mice fed Westernized chow were susceptible to obesity and mast
  cell-associated mammary carcinoma that were inhibited by feeding _L.
- reuteri_.
- The protective effect of consuming _L.
- reuteri_ occurred in a CD25 cell-dependent manner.
- Figure 4\.
- The protective effect of _L.
- reuteri_ depends upon CD25+ cells.
- The depletion of CD25+ cells negated the protective effect offered by _L.
- reuteri_ in mice consuming the western-type diet.
- Compare the mammary gland from a CD25 cell-depleted mouse with carcinoma _in situ_
  with the mammary gland from a sham antibody-treated mouse showing only low grade
  hyperplasia without atypia.
- The mammary epithelium of sham antibody-treated control mice had occasional Ki-67+
  proliferating cells (Ki-67+ cells in the lymphoid follicle germinal center of the
  mammary lymph node serves as a stain internal positive control).
- In contrast, CD25 cell-depleted mice had a hyperproliferative mammary gland epithelium.
- Mammary gland pathology after CD25+ cell depletion co-existed with a significant
  increase of mast cells.
- 'Histopathology: Hematoxylin and eosin.'
- 'Ki-67: DAB chromogen, Hematoxylin counterstain.'
- 'Mast cells: Toluidine Blue stain.'
- 'Bars: Histopathology = 25 μm; Ki-67 = 100 μm; Mast cells = 50 μm.'
- To test whether an obesity component is specifically required for cancer-protective
  benefits of _L.
- reuteri,_ we next tested _L.
- 'reuteri_ efficacy in mice that do not typically develop age-associated obesity:
  an FVB strain erbB2 mutant mouse genetically predisposed to mammary tumors mimicking
  30% of breast cancers diagnosed in women.'
- For these studies, age-matched HER2/neu mutant mice, that develop tumors without
  obesity when eating regular chow, were either untreated or had their drinking water
  supplemented with _L.
- reuteri_.
- The study duration allowed mice to reach 1 year of age, unless these animals were
  humanely euthanized prematurely due to a total cumulative mammary tumor burden exceeding
  2 cm in diameter.
- The HER2 transgenic mouse model, unlike the outbred Swiss mice which were obese,
  did not require age-associated obesity in order to spontaneously develop numerous
  and large-sized mammary tumors (Fig.
- 5 and Supporting Information Fig.
- S3).
- Figure 5\.
- Tumor-free survival was increased in HER2 transgenic mice after eating purified
  _L.
- reuteri_.
- Mice exhibited a delayed onset of mammary tumor burden (_a_).
- This anti-cancer protection effect was transplantable using highly purified CD4+CD45RBloCD25+
  immune cells into HER2 transgenic recipient mice (b).
- Knowing that dietary intake of certain lactic acid organisms was previously shown
  to lower the risk of breast cancer in women,[22, 23] and mammary cancer in mice,[24-26]
  led us to test the effects of _L.
- reuteri_ consumption in mouse models of mammary malignancy.
- Age-matched HER2/neu mutant mice were either untreated or had their water supplemented
  with _L.
- reuteri_ ATCC-PTA-6475[22, 33] with live organisms supplied at a starting dosage
  of 3.5 × 105 organisms/mouse/day in drinking water.
- Mice were euthanized when the total cumulative tumor burden on the animal reached
  2 cm in diameter or when animals reached 1 year of age.
- We found that treating with _L.
- reuteri_ in water delayed or completely prevented tumor onset when compared with
  untreated mice (Fig.
- 5_a_).
- This showed that consumption of lactic acid bacteria alone was sufficient to inhibit
  mammary tumorigenesis and improve tumor-free longevity, even in mice genetically
  predisposed to cancer, with consumption of lactic acid microbes counteracting genetic
  risks.
- In addition, we found that key indicators of malignancy were significantly altered
  in transgenic animals receiving regular chow in combination with purified _L.
- reuteri_ in their drinking water (Fig.
- 6 and Supporting Information Fig.
- S4).
- Mammary tumors of untreated MMTV-neu HER2 mice (_N_ = 10 animals) eating regular
  diets displayed the typical histopathological features for this mouse model.
- Tumors were primarily solid (Supporting Information Fig.
- S4) but often had areas displaying a papillary growth pattern (not shown).
- In contrast to spontaneous tumors of aged Swiss mice on westernized diet, HER2/neu
  tumors showed no abnormal β-catenin staining pattern (Supporting Information Fig.
- S5).
- Dietary _L.
- reuteri_ in HER2 mice (_N_ = 8 animals) did not alter the histopathological pattern
  of tumor growth or the proliferating capacity of tumor cells.
- However, tumors from probiotic-fed mice had increased areas of intra-tumoral necrosis
  and increased features of histopathologically discernible apoptosis.
- To quantify apoptosis more accurately we utilized caspase-3 specific immunostaining.
- Morphometric counts of apoptosis showed that tumors from _L.
- reuteri-_treated mice had significantly (_p_ &lt; 0.0021) more apoptosis compared
  to tumors from their nontreated counterparts.
- To further elaborate on this result, we examined the tumors for the expression of
  two pleiotropic factors with known anti-apoptotic effects on tumors, including those
  originating from mammary epithelium.
- Utilizing NFκ-B p65- and c-Jun-specific immunohistochemistry and morphometric counts
  of positively-stained cells in comparable (non-necrotic) tumor areas, we found that
  _L.
- reuteri_ induced a significant decrease of nuclear NFκ-B (_p_ &lt; 0.0002) and of
  c-Jun (_p_ &lt; 0.0025) in neoplastic cells (Fig.
- 6).
- Interestingly, tumor cells neighboring to necrotic areas in tumors from _L.
- reuteri-_fed mice had increased c-Jun expression (Supporting Information Fig.
- S6).
- These data, when combined, suggested that consuming _L.
- reuteri_ served to upregulate apoptosis in the tumor prone mammary tissue.
- Figure 6\.
- Feeding of _L.
- reuteri_ increases apoptosis and suppresses anti-apoptotic signals in HER2/neu mammary
  tumors.
- Morphometric counts of immunohistochemically labeled tumors suggest that _L.
- reuteri_ consumption associates with a significant increase in neoplastic cell apoptosis
  (Caspase-3+ cells) and a significantly decrease in NFκ-B- and c-Jun-derived tumor
  cell-originating anti-apoptotic signals.

- To identify a cellular mechanism of the benefits of the probiotic, and having previously
  shown a protective role for CD25+ cells in Swiss mice, we purified CD4+CD45RBloCD25+
  cells from syngeneic FVB wild-type mice that were either untreated or supplemented
  with oral administration of _L.
- reuteri_ in the drinking water, as above.
- Afterward, 3 × 105 purified CD4+CD45RBloCD25+ lymphocytes were injected intraperitoneally
  into randomly untreated recipient HER2/neu mutant animals with some pre-existing
  tumor burden at 6 months of age.
- All recipient animals were euthanized at 3-4 weeks after adoptive cell transfer.
- We found that transfer of _L.
- reuteri_ treated CD4+CD45RBloCD25+ cells alone was sufficient to inhibit or suppress
  mammary tumors when compared with untreated animals or with animals that received
  cells from untreated FVB donor mice.
- Mice that received _L.
- reuteri_ treated CD4+CD45RBloCD25+ cells had a significantly (_p_ &lt; 0.016) smaller
  tumor burden and fewer tumors (_p_ &lt; 0.011) compared with the other treatment
  groups (Fig.
- 5_b_).
- Taken together, this was in line with earlier work showing that intestinal bacteria
  impact systemic carcinogenic events _via_ recruitment of bacteria-triggered CD4+CD25+
  immune cells,[13, 30] and supported our hypothesis that lactic acid organisms such
  as _L.
- reuteri_ may protect from cancer by favorably biasing the immune system through
  induction of anti-inflammatory CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells.
- Here we used two etiologically divergent animal models to investigate mechanisms
  of lactic acid microbes previously shown to impact breast cancer outcomes in women.
- '[22, 23] In both mouse models we found that exposure to _L.'
- reuteri_ in their drinking water ultimately lowered risk of mammary carcinogenesis
  in an immune cell-dependent manner.
- Importantly, we show that (_i_) lower cancer risk outcomes were achievable in both
  models using purified _L.
- reuteri_ organisms alone, regardless of the baseline diet, (_ii_) an environmental
  microbial exposure such as _L.
- reuteri_ was sufficient to inhibit carcinogenesis, even with a pre-existing genetic
  predilection to cancer, and (_iii_) _L.
- reuteri_ cancer-protective outcomes required microbe-triggered CD25+ cells.
- We concluded that microbes such as _L.
- reuteri_ may ultimately offer a tractable public health approach to foster protective
  immunity and help counteract the accumulated dietary and genetic carcinogenic events
  integral in the Westernized diet and lifestyle.
- Outbred Swiss mice consuming a Westernized "fast food" (NWD) chow mimicked adiposity
  patterns and associated breast cancer risk in people,[1-6] with lower risk of carcinogenesis
  after consuming _L.
- reuteri_.
- For an outbred strain, the Swiss mice had a remarkably increased diet-associated
  risk to develop pre-neoplastic and neoplastic mammary lesions in the present study.
- This risk may not exclusively be related to the diet.
- Although control-diet-fed Swiss mice had significantly less hyperplasia from westernized-diet
  fed mice, several mice of the control group did have some degree of focal or multifocal
  mammary gland hyperplasia.
- These changes, although mild, are rather unusual based on our empiric observations
  in virgin mice of other strains.
- This matches previously reported observations in mammary tissue of untreated FVB
  mice, an inbred strain closely related to the white Swiss mouse.
- '[31, 32] Unlike FVB mice, the aged outbred Swiss mouse we examined showed no spontaneous
  mammary tumors when fed with a normal diet.'
- Nonetheless, the possibility that mouse strain-related factors may contribute to
  some extent in the westernized diet-induced mammary tumorigenesis we report here
  cannot be excluded.
- Hyperproliferative and preneoplastic mammary glands in NWD-fed mice were surrounded
  by particularly increased numbers of mast cells.
- This is highly suggestive for a cross-talk between these cells and the proliferating
  epithelium, and reminiscent of their accumulation in the expanding terminal end
  bud of the mammary ductal system at puberty.
- '[33] Mast cells facilitate abnormal gland growth by extracellular matrix degradation
  and the remodeling of adjacent tissues.'
- They also produce growth factors and cytokines.
- Studies in both humans and mice describe significant contributions of mast cells
  into tumor evolution and development.
- '[33-35]


  Mast cell accumulations were inversely related to the _L.'
- reuteri_-induced restoration of the Foxp3+ cell population within mammary lymph
  nodes.
- In addition, mast cells were robustly increased after depletion of CD25+ cells.
- This result suggests that gut bacteria-triggered CD25+Foxp3+ Treg cells can not
  only inhibit systemic mast cell-associated pathologies, such as allergy and autoimmune
  reactions,[29] but also early stage carcinogenesis, as well.
- Consequently, it supports the concept that exposures to lactic acid microbiota stimulate
  Treg cell-orchestrated immune networks capable of inhibiting inflammatory diseases,
  including early stage malignant transformation.
- '[35, 36]


  These observations associated with a Western diet in aging Swiss female mice support
  a mechanistic model whereby lactic acid microbes impact host immunity, which in
  turn affects obesity and carcinogenesis that subsequently alters host immunity,
  and so forth.'
- Once initiated, these processes may become self-sustaining.
- We postulate that oral dosing of _L.
- reuteri_ imparts immune homeostasis that then maintains systemic immune balance
  relying upon sustained immune tolerance.
- Diet and microbe-induced failure of tolerance unifies these data with prior work
  involving inflammation, obesity, and cancer.
- '[18, 37] Diverse disorders such as asthma and autoimmune diseases associated with
  Westernized living are widely believed to result from insufficient immune tolerance
  that is essential for sustained systemic health.'
- Westernized diets are also low in vitamin D, a nutrient that normally works together
  with IL-10 to enforce immune tolerance and protect against inflammatory disorders[38]
  and some types of cancer.
- '[39]


  To overcome diet and obesity-associated biases in understanding carcinogenesis,
  we separately tested roles of _L.'
- reuteri_ and candidate immune cells in slender erbB2 mutant mice, with a genetic
  predisposition to mammary tumors mimicking 30% of breast cancers diagnosed in women.
- '[15] Our finding that mammary tumors from HER2/neu mice consuming _L.'
- reuteri_ have increased intratumoral necrosis and apoptosis is similar to our previous
  findings in _ApcMin/+_ mice after adoptive transfer of microbe-induced Treg cells.
- Regressive intestinal adenomas in these _ApcMin/+_ mice after Treg cell transfer
  were characterized by umbilicated necrotic centers and increased tumor cell apoptosis.
- '[37] NFκ-B and c-Jun expression of tumor cells have both been associated with increased
  tumor malignancy in humans[40, 41] and mouse models of mammary cancer, including
  the HER2/neu mice.'
- '[42] An important aspect of the tumor-promoting effect of these pleiotropic proteins
  lies in their tumor cell survival and anti-apoptotic effects.'
- '[43] We found that dietary _L.'
- reuteri_ blocked NFκ-B-p65 nuclear translocation and c-jun expression in mammary
  tumor cells.
- This effect may have rendered HER2/neu tumor cells less resistant to apoptosis,
  and thus explain, at least in part, the probiotic microbe-induced anti-neoplastic
  effect.
- It is not entirely clear how host hormones triggered by microbial symbionts such
  as _L.
- reuteri_ may impact the carcinogenic processes.
- We have recently discovered that consumption of _L.
- reuteri_ up-regulates plasma levels of the neuropeptide hormone oxytocin[17, 18,
  44] that also benefits damaged tissue repairs,[44] a concept that may extrapolate
  from wound healing to breast cancer.
- '[45] It has also been shown that oxytocin may counteract some of the immune suppressive
  effects of estrogen.'
- '[46] These observations, if translatable to humans, may be particularly important
  given the proposed roles of oxytocin in protection from breast cancer.'
- '[47] In addition, emerging data relate oxytocin with metabolism and the immune
  system[46, 48] connecting microbial symbionts such as _L.'
- reuteri_ with immune fitness in evolutionary success.
- '[46]


  Our previous work and that of many others has revealed that CD4+CD25+ cells are
  a basic cellular carrier of gut microbially triggered signals that shape the immune
  system to restore homeostasis in inflammatory-associated pathologies, cancer, and
  reproductive health.'
- '[13, 49, 50] We discovered that the _L.'
- reuteri_ benefit was transferable to other recipient animals using CD4+CD45RBloCD25+
  cells alone, as long as those cells were from immune-competent donor animals.
- In our previous studies we have shown that homeostatic properties reside predominantly
  in this sub-population of Treg cells.
- '[14] In the present study transplanted CD4+CD45RBloCD25+ immune cells from _L.'
- reuteri_-primed donor animals were sufficient to completely recapitulate the _L.
- reuteri_-induced phenomenon in HER2 transgenic recipient host animals.
- In conclusion, we found that ingested microbes impact the systemic immune system
  at the whole organism level and serve to counteract a genetic predisposition to
  cancer, even within the tumor micro-environment.
- Beneficial microbes may ultimately offer tractable population-based approaches to
  target cancer.
