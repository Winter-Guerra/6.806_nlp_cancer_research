- To study the association between consumption of dairy products and calcium intake
  and risk of breast cancer risk according to menopausal status.
- In a population-based prospective cohort study of 64,904 Norwegian women followed
  from 1996/1999 through 2006, we examined total dairy consumption and consumption
  of various dairy products in relation to pre- and postmenopausal breast cancer risk.
- We also examined breast cancer in relation to calcium intake and to milk consumption
  during childhood and performed additional analyses corrected for measurement errors
  in the dietary data.
- In total, 218 premenopausal and 1,189 postmenopausal incident breast cancer cases
  were diagnosed during follow-up.
- Total dairy, adult, and childhood milk consumption was not associated with either
  pre- or postmenopausal breast cancer risk.
- Premenopausal women with the highest consumption of white cheese had half the risk
  of breast cancer compared to those with the lowest consumption (hazard rate ratio
  in the 4th quartile vs. the 1st quartile 0.50, 95% confidence interval 0.29–0.87).
- Total calcium intake tended to be inversely related to premenopausal (hazard rate
  ratio in the 4th quartile vs. the 1st quartile 0.65, 95% confidence interval 0.39–1.08)
  and postmenopausal breast cancer (hazard rate ratio in the 4th quartile vs. the
  1st quartile 0.85, 95% confidence interval 0.70–1.04).
- Correcting for measurement errors did not alter the results substantially, nor did
  exclusion of early cancer cases.
- Dairy consumption is not strongly related to breast cancer risk in this prospective
  study.
- A non-significant negative association between calcium intake and breast cancer
  risk was seen, particularly among premenopausal women.
- A high consumption of dairy products is common in many Western populations [1].
- The food group often contributes a substantial part of individual’s intake of saturated
  fat and calcium, and also vitamin D in areas with widespread vitamin D fortification
  of dairy products.
- Whereas saturated fat has been suggested to increase the risk of breast cancer [2],
  calcium and vitamin D—whether supplied through the diet or synthesized in the skin
  during sun exposure—have been hypothesized to decrease the risk [3].
- Also other components of dairy products have been proposed to influence the risk
  of breast cancer, e.g., an increased risk by environmental contaminants and insulin-like
  growth factors [4–6], and a decreased risk by conjugated linoleic acids [7, 8].
- The fact that dairy products contain a mixture of components that possibly influences
  breast cancer risk in opposite directions makes the net effect of dairy consumption
  difficult to settle.
- Reviews of epidemiological studies [4, 6], a meta-analysis [9] and a pooled analysis
  of cohort studies [10] have concluded that there is no evidence for a strong association
  between dairy consumption and breast cancer risk.
- Positive [11], negative [12–14], and null findings [15–20] have been reported in
  cohort studies.
- Moreover, the findings may vary according to menopausal status [21–23] and between
  various dairy products [11, 12, 15].
- Also for calcium intake the association with breast cancer is inconsistent and may
  differ with menopausal status [3, 20, 21, 23, 24].
- In an earlier study of premenopausal breast cancer in the Norwegian Women and Cancer
  study (NOWAC), we found an inverse association between milk consumption and breast
  cancer risk [25].
- The age-adjusted incidence rate of breast cancer in Norway is high (72.8 per 100,000
  person-years in 2008) [26] and so is the consumption of milk and other dairy products
  (per capita supply in 2008 was 178 kg) [27].
- In the present study, we wanted to examine breast cancer risk and dairy consumption
  more thoroughly using more detailed dietary data from NOWAC (comprising intake of
  several dairy products and calcium), a higher number of breast cancer cases, and
  performing analyses for both pre- and postmenopausal women.
- Furthermore, as dietary data are prone to measurement errors we also perform corrections
  for such errors in our risk analyses by applying validation data from a sub-sample
  of NOWAC [28].
- NOWAC is a nationwide cohort study set up at the University of Tromsø, Norway in
  1991.
- It currently comprises more than 165,700 women born 1927–65 randomly drawn from
  the National Central Person Register [29, 30].
- There is a small oversampling from the three most northern counties (_n_ = 13,674).
- Due to practical workload, financial restraints and methodological sub-studies [31]
  the baseline enrollment was separated into a number of different sub-series and
  carried out from 1991 to 1997, and from 2003 to 2006.
- As the follow-up time for the women in the last inclusion period is very short,
  only women enrolled from 1991 to 1997 are included in the current paper.
- The women received a mailed letter of invitation requesting informed consent and
  a self-instructive questionnaire focusing on certain topics (e.g., diet or sun exposure),
  and also containing a number of core questions.
- Detailed dietary questions have been included in the questionnaires since 1996.
- To expand and update the exposure information, a second questionnaire was from 1998
  to 2002 sent to the responders of the baseline mailing conducted in 1991–1997.
- After one or two reminders, the response rate for the first (baseline) questionnaire
  (1991–1997) was 57% (102,540/179,387), and 81% (80,835/99,541) for the second questionnaire
  (1998–2002).
- The present analyses are restricted to women who gave detailed dietary information
  in the period 1996–1999, either in their first questionnaire (_n_ = 30,333) or in
  their second questionnaire (_n_ = 38,184).
- The Regional Committee for Medical Research Ethics and the Norwegian Data Inspection
  Board approved the study.
- Dietary information was collected by means of a semi-quantitative food frequency
  section in the questionnaire, described in details previously [28, 32].
- In short, the participants were asked to record their average consumption of various
  food items during the last year ticking off fixed boxes.
- 'Consumption of the following dairy items was asked for: glasses of whole milk,
  low-fat milk and skimmed milk drunk per week or day, packages of yoghurt eaten per
  week or day, slices of bread with whole fat brown cheese, low-fat/skimmed brown
  cheese, whole fat white cheese and low-fat/skimmed white cheese eaten per week,
  and frequency and amount of ice cream eaten per month or week during the summer
  and during the rest of the year.'
- In addition, the participants were asked to record what kind of fat (butter or margarine)
  they usually used on bread, and how often and how much melted or solid fat, full
  fat sour cream, and fat-reduced sour cream they used for fish meals.
- Number of glasses of milk consumed per day during childhood was recorded in most
  of the sub-series.
- Alcohol intake was calculated from three questions on beer, wine, and spirit consumption.
- Daily intake of foods, energy and nutrients was computed using a computation program
  developed at the Institute of Community Medicine, University of Tromsø, for SAS
  software.
- Missing frequencies were treated as null intake and missing portion sizes as the
  smallest portion unit in the questionnaire, giving a conservative intake estimate
  [33].
- For the women included in the analytic cohort, mode for missing frequencies on the
  10 relevant dairy questions was zero; the median was two.
- The recorded frequency was multiplied with the recorded portion size or a standard
  portion [34], and transformed into daily food intake in grams.
- Total dairy consumption was calculated by summing up the consumption of all the
  items listed above (Table 1), except brown cheese and fat on bread and for fish
  meals due to the dissimilar nutrient content of these items.
- Nutrient intake was calculated by multiplying the daily food intake (in grams) of
  each item with the nutrient content of the item as given in the official Norwegian
  food composition table [35].
- Calcium intake was calculated from all food items in the questionnaire (about 80
  questions), excluding supplements.
- Vitamin D intake was calculated from all food items in the questionnaire including
  cod liver oil (commonly used in Norway), but no other supplements.
- "At the time of the data collection, margarine and butter were the only foods in
  Norway fortified with vitamin D.\n\n\nConsumption of dairy products (g/day) in the
  Norwegian Women and Cancer study (_n_ = 64,904)  \n\n\nThe intake of dairy foods
  and calcium was energy-adjusted by using the residual method [36]."
- That is, we added the residuals of the regression of the intake of dairy foods and
  calcium on total energy intake, to the predicted intake at mean level of energy
  intake.
- The reproducibility of the questionnaire has been examined in a sub-sample of 1,370
  NOWAC participants [37].
- Spearman’s correlation coefficient between consumption of milk, yoghurt and cheese
  in the test (February/March 2002) and in the retest (May/June 2002) questionnaire
  was 0.74.
- The relative validity of the questionnaire has been evaluated against four repeated
  24-h dietary recalls in a sub-sample of 238 NOWAC women [28].
- Compared to the registrations by the 24-h recalls, the questionnaire slightly underestimated
  the consumption of milk and yoghurt, whereas no significant differences were seen
  for consumption of cheese and ice cream.
- Spearman’s correlation coefficient between consumption registered by the questionnaire
  and by the 24-h recalls was 0.74 (95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.68–0.79) for milk
  and yoghurt, 0.42 (95% CI 0.31–0.52) for cheese and 0.35 (95% CI 0.23–0.46) for
  ice cream.
- As for calcium, the questionnaire underestimated the intake compared to the 24-h
  recalls (619 vs. 724 mg/day), Spearman’s correlation coefficient between the registrations
  made by the two methods was 0.50 (95% CI 0.39–0.59), 68% of the subjects were classified
  into the same or adjacent calcium quintile by the two methods, and 2% were classified
  in the extreme quintile.
- Parts of the questionnaire have also been evaluated against fatty acid composition
  in serum phospholipids [32].
- Information on age at invitation was obtained from National Central Person Register.
- 'To handle the effect of potential confounding factors and effect modifying factors
  the following information was derived from the questionnaire: body weight and height,
  weight change since age 18, level of physical activity, smoking status, years of
  education, maternal history of breast cancer, mammography practice, age at menarche,
  number of children and age at first birth, use of oral contraceptives, menopausal
  status, and use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) if postmenopausal.'
- As only one single recording of menopausal status was available for the present
  analyses, we assigned all women who were premenopausal when filling out the questionnaire
  to be postmenopausal when they reached the age of 50 during follow-up.
- This procedure was followed for women reporting hysterectomy, whereas women reporting
  bilateral oophorectomy were considered postmenopausal throughout.
- The age of 50 as a dividing line for menopausal status was chosen based on data
  from an older sub-sample of NOWAC [38].
- Information on self-reported menopausal status and use of HRT has be evaluated against
  plasma levels of sex hormones and found valid [39].
- When checking for interactions between menopausal status and dairy consumption,
  we examined both the effect of menopausal status at the time of data recording and
  the effect of menopausal status at end of follow-up.
- No significant interaction was seen in either of the analyses.
- Information from the questionnaire was linked to the Cancer Registry of Norway to
  identify incident breast cancer cases.
- In Norway, it is mandatory by law to report all incident cancer cases to the cancer
  registry, and the registry has an almost complete record of all cancer cases [40–42].
- More than 98% of the breast cancers were histologically verified.
- In situ breast cancers were not regarded as breast cancer.
- A corresponding linkage to records at Statistics Norway provided information on
  death and emigration.
- All linkages were done by means of the unique individual national identification
  number present in the cohort data set and in the national registers, and ensured
  complete follow-up.
- Of the 68,517 women initially in the present cohort, we excluded 2,900 women with
  a prior cancer diagnosis (any type), one woman with uncertain breast cancer diagnosis,
  seven women who died and three women who emigrated before the start of the follow-up.
- We also excluded 104 women who did not answer any of the dairy questions, 585 women
  for whom the calculated daily energy intake was below 2,500 kJ (_n_ = 516) or above
  15,000 kJ (_n_ = 69), and 13 women with implausible age at menopause.
- Thus, 64,904 women were included in the main analyses.
- In addition, we performed analyses excluding women who were diagnosed with any kind
  of cancer (_n_ = 364) or died (_n_ = 41) during the first year of follow-up in order
  to avoid the possibility that undiagnosed cancer or other severe illness influenced
  the self-reported data.
- Person-years of follow-up were calculated as the time elapsed from the date of the
  returned questionnaire (defined as 3 months after mailing of the invitation letter)
  to the time of cancer (any type), to time of death or emigration, or to the end
  of follow-up (31 December 2006), whichever occurred first.
- Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were carried out to investigate the
  simultaneous effect of dairy consumption and covariates on breast cancer incidence
  rate, and hazard rate ratios (HRR) and 95% CI were calculated.
- Various categorizations (e.g., quartiles, users–non-users) were applied for the
  dairy variables.
- 'The combined effect of childhood milk consumption and adult dairy consumption was
  examined by constructing a three-level variable: ‘low consumption,’ defined as no
  milk consumption as a child or 1st quartile of dairy consumption as adult and not
  more than next-lowest consumption (1–3 glasses/day)/2nd quartile on the other occasion;
  ‘high consumption,’ defined as the highest milk consumption as a child (7 or more
  glasses/day) or 4th quartile of dairy consumption as adult and not less than the
  next-highest consumption (4–6 glasses/day)/3rd quartile on the other occasions;
  and ‘moderate consumption,’ defined as all other combinations.'
- The low consumption group was used as the reference category.
- Calcium intake was examined in quartiles.
- 'Different combinations of the covariates reported at cohort enrollment were employed
  in multivariable analyses: age at cohort enrollment (5-year categories), height
  (quartiles: &lt;163, 163–165, 166–169, &gt;169 cm), body mass index (BMI = (wt(kg))/(ht(m)2))
  (quartiles: &lt;22.0, 22.0–23.9, 24.0–26.4, &gt;26.4), BMI at age 18 (quartiles:
  &lt;19.2, 19.2–20.5, 20.6–22.2, &gt;22.2), weight increase since age 18 years (quartiles:
  &lt;4, 4–9, 10–15, &gt;15 kg), level of physical activity (inactive, moderately
  active, active), smoking status (current, former, never), education (&lt;11, 11–13,
  &gt;13 years), maternal history of breast cancer (yes, no), mammography practice
  (no, every 2nd year or more often, every 2nd year or more seldom), age at menarche
  (quartiles: &lt;13, 13, 14, &gt;14 years), number of children and age at first birth
  (nulliparous, 1 child/birth before age 21, 2 or more children/first birth before
  age 21, 1 child/birth at age 21 or older, 2 or more children/first birth at age
  21 or older), use of oral contraceptives (ever, never), and alcohol consumption
  (0 and tertiles: 0.1–1.52, 1.53–4.13, &gt;4.13 g/day).'
- To assess the influence of HRT (ever, never), we conducted analysis restricted to
  women who were postmenopausal when completing the questionnaire.
- Further, we examined any possible confounding effect of intake of fruit, vegetables
  and potatoes, fat, and vitamin D (all in quartiles).
- To adjust for energy intake, we categorized the women according to their energy-adjusted
  intake of each dairy variable (except childhood milk consumption and the combined
  child/adult consumption variable) and also added total energy intake (in quartiles)
  to the model.
- To test for linear trend in risk, we created a continuous variable by assigning
  ordinal numbers to each level of exposure and including the continuous variable
  in the regression models.
- Interaction effects were tested using the likelihood ratio test.
- The assumptions of proportional hazards for the exposures of interest were examined
  by log–log plots and cumulative hazard plots.
- To get an idea about the effect of measurement error in the dietary data, we used
  the 24-h dietary recalls from the validation study to perform a measurement error
  correction based on the regression calibration method [43, 44].
- Using the energy-adjusted dairy variables and alcohol on its original continuous
  scale, we constructed multivariate calibration models by regressing the individual
  means of the recall values of the dairy variables and alcohol on the questionnaire
  values.
- Information about total energy intake, age, height, weight increase since age 18,
  level of physical activity, years of education, maternal history of breast cancer,
  mammography practice, and use of oral contraceptives were also included in this
  model.
- This was done separately for each of the six dairy exposure variables.
- The calibration models are slightly smaller than the full models used in the main
  analyses due to the lower number of women included in the calibration.
- We excluded variables assumed not to be associated with intake of dairy products
  or alcohol.
- Data from 180 women were included in the calibration.
- This is a somewhat lower number than what was originally included in the validation
  study (_n_ = 238).
- The 180 women included here are those among the 238 who are also included in the
  main analysis, so that we were able to collect background information to be used
  in the calibration.
- Using the publicly available SAS-macro _blinplus_ (http://​www.​hsph.​harvard.​edu/​faculty/​spiegelman/​blinplus.​html),
  we then performed a measurement error correction based on this calibration model.
- All reported _p_ values are two-sided, and a significance criterion of _p_ &lt;
  0.05 was used to consider an association as statistically significant.
- The number of subjects included in the separate analyses varies somewhat due to
  item non-response.
- Statistical analyses were done by means of the SAS software package, version 9.1.
- During 557,753 person-years of follow-up (average 8.6 years), 1,407 of the 64,904
  women were diagnosed with breast cancer.
- Two hundred eighteen of the diagnosed breast cancers were regarded as premenopausal
  cancer, and 1,189 were regarded as postmenopausal cancer.
- The mean age at diagnosis was 56.8 years (range 41.1–78.9).
- Median daily consumption of dairy products was 174 g, with low-fat milk and skimmed
  milk as the largest contributors (Table 1).
- Less than 0.5% of the women did not consume any dairy products at all.
- Some characteristics of the cohort according to total dairy consumption are given
  in Table 2.
- Most of the known breast cancer risk factors did not vary noticeably across quartiles
  of dairy consumption.
- Women in the 3rd quartile of dairy consumption (174–369 g/day) tended to have more
  years of education and a smaller fraction of them were smokers compared to women
  in the other quartiles.
- Both energy intake and daily intake of fat, calcium and vitamin D increased with
  increasing intake of dairy products.
- Dairy products were not fortified with vitamin D in Norway at the time of data collection,
  and the positive association between intake of vitamin D and dairy consumption can
  largely be ascribed to a higher proportion taking cod liver oil, an item very rich
  in vitamin D, in the higher quartiles.
- "Characteristics according to total dairy consumption (g/day) in the Norwegian Women
  and Cancer study (_n_ = 64,904)  \n\n\n\nThe majority of the women (64%) reported
  drinking 1–3 glasses of milk per day during childhood, 27% reported drinking 4–6
  glasses per day and nearly 2% reported drinking 7 glasses or more."
- Some 6% did not drink milk as a child.
- 'Both total dairy consumption and total milk consumption as an adult increased by
  increasing milk consumption as a child (both: _p_ for trend &lt; 0.001) (data not
  shown).'
- For instance, women who reported drinking 7 or more glasses of milk as a child had
  an adult median daily intake of milk of 150 g compared to 118 g for women who drank
  1–3 glasses and 0 g for women who did not drink milk as a child.
- Total dairy consumption was not associated with risk of premenopausal or postmenopausal
  breast cancer either in age-adjusted analysis or after adjusting for age, energy
  intake, alcohol intake, height, weight increase since age 18, level of physical
  activity, years of education, maternal history of breast cancer, mammography practice,
  age at menarche, number of children and age at first birth, and use of oral contraceptives
  (Table 3).
- Additional adjustment for use of HRT among postmenopausal women reduced the number
  of subjects in the model as this variable was recorded only for women who were postmenopausal
  when filling in the questionnaire (and not for those who became postmenopausal during
  follow-up) and reduced the risk estimates marginally (data not shown).
- Further adjustment for BMI when filling in the questionnaire and at age 18 did not
  contribute significantly to either the pre- or the postmenopausal model, nor did
  adjustment for smoking status (data not shown).
- We also performed analyses adjusting for consumption of fruit, vegetables and potatoes,
  total intake of fat, and vitamin D intake; the risk estimates for pre- and postmenopausal
  breast cancer changed negligible (data not shown).
- Rerunning the multivariate models presented in Table 3 after excluding women who
  died or got a cancer diagnosis during their first year of follow-up reduced the
  number of premenopausal breast cancer cases to _n_ = 121 and the number of postmenopausal
  breast cancer cases to _n_ = 733; the risk estimates were practically identical
  to those given in Table 3 (data not shown).
- Hazard rate ratios (HRR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of invasive breast cancer
  according to total dairy consumption and calcium intake.
- "The Norwegian Women and Cancer study  \n\n\naAdjusted for age, energy intake, alcohol
  intake, height, weight increase since age 18, level of physical activity, years
  of education, maternal history of breast cancer, mammography practice, age at menarche,
  number of children and age at first birth, and use of oral contraceptives\n\nOverall,
  intake of calcium tended to be inversely related to breast cancer risk, but the
  risk estimates and trends were not statistically significant."
- Excluding those who died or got a cancer diagnosis during their 1st year of follow-up
  and rerunning the multivariate model in Table 3 had no effect on the inverse trend
  for premenopausal breast cancer (_p_ for trend = 0.08), but weakened the trend for
  postmenopausal breast cancer (_p_ for trend = 0.23).
- Like total dairy consumption, total milk consumption (whole, low-fat and skimmed
  milk) was not associated with neither premenopausal nor postmenopausal breast cancer
  (Table 4).
- No noteworthy changes in risk were seen when excluding cancer cases and deaths emerging
  during the 1st year of follow-up (data not shown).
- When expressing total milk consumption in terms of fat from milk (median intake
  0.8 g/day) there tended to be an increasing risk for premenopausal breast cancer
  with increasing intake of fat from milk, whereas no association was seen for postmenopausal
  breast cancer (Table 4).
- Rerunning the multivariate model in Table 4 excluding those who died or got a cancer
  diagnosis during their 1st year of follow-up slightly reduced the trend for premenopausal
  breast cancer (_p_ for trend = 0.10), otherwise there were no changes (data not
  shown).
- Hazard rate ratios (HRR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of invasive breast cancer
  according to dairy food intakes.
- "The Norwegian Women and Cancer study  \n\n\naAdjusted for age, energy intake, alcohol
  intake, height, weight increase since age 18, level of physical activity, years
  of education, maternal history of breast cancer, mammography practice, age at menarche,
  number of children and age at first birth, and use of oral contraceptives\n\nbThe
  total number of cases is reduced to 147 and 746 for pre- and postmenopausal women,
  respectively, as not all study participants were asked about milk consumption as
  a child\n\nYoghurt consumption was not associated with breast cancer (Table 4)."
- Consumption of white cheese showed a statistically significant inverse association
  with both premenopausal and postmenopausal breast cancer.
- Premenopausal women consuming at least 25 g cheese per day (4th quartile) had a
  50% reduced risk of breast cancer compared to women consuming &lt;6 g/day (1st quartile)
  (HRR 0.50, 95% CI 0.29–0.87); for postmenopausal women the risk was reduced by approximately
  20% (HRR 0.81, 95% CI 0.66–0.99) (Table 4).
- 'The inverse associations were somewhat weakened when early cancer cases and deaths
  were excluded (both: _p_ for trend = 0.11).'
- Milk consumption as a child was not related to either pre- or postmenopausal breast
  cancer (data not shown).
- Also, when combining milk consumption as a child and adult dairy consumption we
  did not observe any association with breast cancer risk (Table 4).
- As described in the “Materials and methods” section, we also performed a correction
  for measurement error based on the regression calibration method, on the models
  presented in Tables 3 and 4, except for the analysis of consumption as a child and
  as adult.
- The results from this correction are given in Table 5.
- Notice that these analyses are based on intake measured on continuous scale.
- The general trend is that the correction does not alter the initial findings much.
- The most substantial alteration takes place in the estimated effect of white cheese,
  where the measurement error corrected analysis shows a non-significant protective
  effect.
- It should be noted, however, that the uncertainty associated with the calibration
  is quite large, leading to wide confidence intervals for the error corrected estimates.
- Hazard rate ratios (HRR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of invasive breast cancer
  according to calcium and dairy food intakes with and without correction for measurement
  error.
- "The Norwegian Women and Cancer study  \n\n\naAdjusted for age, energy intake, alcohol
  intake, height, weight increase since age 18, level of physical activity, years
  of education, maternal history of breast cancer, mammography practice, and use of
  oral contraceptives\n\n\n\nIn this prospective cohort study, we did not find any
  significant association between total dairy consumption and risk of pre- or postmenopausal
  breast cancer."
- However, there was a tendency of an inverse association for some dairy products,
  particularly for premenopausal breast cancer.
- Total calcium intake was inversely related to breast cancer, whereas no association
  was seen for fat from milk.
- Previous studies on dairy consumption and risk of breast cancer have been inconclusive;
  overall there does not seem to be a strong association either for total dairy consumption
  or for specific dairy items [4, 6].
- In the present study, we saw a 50% decreased risk for premenopausal breast cancer
  among women consuming 25 g of white cheese per day compared to women consuming less
  than 6 g/day.
- However, we found no dose–response relationship.
- In the analysis corrected for measurement errors an increase of 5 g cheese decreased
  the risk with 24%.
- Four previous cohort studies [12, 19, 21, 22] and a pooled analysis of eight cohort
  studies [10] did not find any significant association between cheese consumption
  and breast cancer risk (pre and post), whereas in a study of Seventh-day Adventists
  there was a positive trend with increasing frequency of cheese consumption [15].
- Also, the results from case–control studies have been conflicting [4].
- White cheese can be a good source for calcium.
- The most used white cheeses in Norway typically contain about 800 mg calcium/100
  g, and cheese contributes 28% of the calcium intake [27].
- In the present study we saw a negative association between pre- and postmenopausal
  breast cancer risk and calcium intake.
- Calcium intake has been inversely related to risk of breast cancer in some prospective
  studies [12, 14], although not in all [20, 24].
- In two prospective studies among US women and in a small French study, calcium intake
  was inversely related to premenopausal breast cancer, but not to postmenopausal
  breast cancer [21–23].
- In a Swedish prospective study, pre-diagnostic calcium serum levels were inversely
  related to premenopausal breast cancer in a dose–response manner, whereas a high
  level of calcium indicated an increased risk among overweight peri/postmenopausal
  women [45].
- Further, the Women’s Health Initiative randomized trial did not find any reduced
  incidence of breast cancer among postmenopausal women who had been given calcium
  and vitamin D supplementation for 7 years [46].
- The possibility that any beneficial effect of calcium is modified by menopausal
  status is in accordance with our finding of a somewhat stronger association for
  premenopausal than for postmenopausal breast cancer.
- Calcium may exercise its anticarcinogenic properties through several mechanisms.
- In experimental studies increased concentration of calcium decreases cell proliferation
  and induces differentiation of mammary cells [3].
- It may bind and neutralize fatty acids and mutagenic bile acids [6] and may also
  decrease fat-induced epithelial hyperproliferation in rodent mammary glands [47].
- Metabolically calcium is closely related to vitamin D, which also has been shown
  to influence breast carcinogenesis, and it has been hypothesized that some of the
  anticarcinogenic effect of calcium may be mediated through vitamin D [3].
- For instance, calcium may play an important role in 1,25(OH)2D3 induced apoptosis
  [48].
- In Norway, dairy products were not fortified with vitamin D at the time of data
  collection, and the correlation between calcium intake and vitamin D intake in the
  present cohort was not very strong (Pearson’s _r_ = 0.18).
- In our previous analysis of milk consumption and premenopausal breast cancer, we
  found an inverse association between the combined consumption of milk as a child
  and as an adult and breast cancer [25].
- No such association was seen in the present study.
- Also, our previous analysis showed a significant inverse trend between milk consumption
  as a child and breast cancer incidence restricted to women younger than 40 years
  at baseline.
- In the present study, the youngest women were 41 years at baseline.
- Childhood dairy intake was not associated with development of breast cancer in a
  65-year follow-up of the British Boyd Orr cohort [49], nor was childhood or adolescent
  consumption of milk or dairy products consistently significantly associated with
  breast cancer in several studies from North America [21, 50–53].
- However, indications of a negative association have been reported in two case–control
  studies [54, 55].
- Our finding that any weak protective effect of some dairy products and of calcium
  may be stronger or limited to premenopausal breast cancer is in accordance with
  previous studies [21–23].
- The mechanism for this difference is not clear.
- One hypothesis is that it may be due to the decreased level of insulin growth factors
  with increasing age, which interact with calcium in promoting growth inhibition
  in breast cancer cells [5, 23].
- Another suggestion points to calcium’s potential as a regulator in estrogen-driven
  cell proliferation [56].
- The strengths of our study are the population-based and prospective design, the
  large size of the cohort, the complete follow-up with regard to incidence of cancer,
  death, and emigration, the almost complete histological verification of breast cancer
  cases, and the opportunity to adjust for all established risk factors for breast
  cancer.
- Several questions were asked about dairy consumption and calcium intake was calculated
  from about 80 semi-quantitative food frequency questions.
- As dietary data are prone to measurement errors we performed additional analyses
  correcting the risk estimates for errors by using data from a validation study performed
  in a subsample of the cohort subjects [28].
- As mentioned, the measurement error corrections did not alter the initial findings
  much.
- This may be taken as an indication of robustness toward effects of measurement errors.
- Possible limitations of our study should also be considered.
- We did not have access to repeated exposure measures and to information on calcium
  supplement use, and most non-dietary exposure variables were self-reported for which
  we do not know the validity, except for menopausal status and use of HRT [39].
- We used the linear regression calibration method to adjust for measurement error.
- This method relies on some assumptions about the structure of possible errors in
  the reference instrument (the recalls).
- These errors should be random and independent of both true values and of the errors
  in the questionnaire.
- These assumptions may or may not be met in our case.
- In particular, studies have shown that this last assumption may be doubtful [57,
  58].
- This means that our method may not be able to fully correct for measurement error.
- However, we believe that using this instrument and method is our best option to
  at least gain some insight into the effects of measurement error in these studies.
- In summary, in this prospective, population-based study, we found a non-significant
  inverse association between calcium consumption and risk of breast cancer.
- Total dairy, adult and childhood milk consumption was not associated with breast
  cancer risk, whereas a reduced risk was seen for women with the highest consumption
  of white cheese.
- The results seem to be robust against effects of measurement error.
- To confirm any potential protective effect of calcium and/or specific dairy products,
  more well-designed prospective studies are needed.
- The protective potential may be largest for premenopausal breast cancer.
- Part of the work was supported by an EXTRA grant from the Norwegian Foundation for
  Health and Rehabilitation.
