- The flavonoid, luteolin, has been shown to have anticancer activity in various cancer
  cells; however, the precise molecular mechanism of its action is not completely
  understood, and studies were conducted to find out how it induces apoptosis in breast
  cancer cells.
- Luteolin induced a reduction of viability in a dose- and time-dependent manner.
- The pro-apoptotic effect of luteolin was demonstrated by cell cycle measurement
  and Hoechst 3325 staining.
- Western blot analysis showed that luteolin activates ERK (extracellular-signal-regulated
  kinase) and p38.
- Pharmacological inhibition or knockdown of ERK and p38 protected against luteolin-induced
  cell death; however, the caspase-3-specific inhibitor had no effect.
- Immunocytochemical examination indicated that luteolin induced nuclear translocation
  of AIF (apoptosis-inducing factor), which was mediated by activation of ERK and
  p38.
- Transfection of a vector expressing the miRNA (microRNA) of AIF prevented luteolin-induced
  apoptosis.
- The data suggest that luteolin induces a caspase-dependent and -independent apoptosis
  involving AIF nuclear translocation mediated by activation of ERK and p38 in breast
  cancer cells.
