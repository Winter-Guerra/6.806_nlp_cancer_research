- Allicin, one of the major components of garlic, has wide-ranging health properties.
- However, the effects of allicin on migration and invasion of breast cancer cells
  remain unknown.
- Allicin (0.1-10 ng/ml) inhibited TNF-Î±-induced VCAM-1 protein expression in MCF-7,
  but not in MDA-MB-231.
- Additionally, allicin significantly reduced tumor cell migration and invasion only
  in MCF-7 cells.
- Our results also demonstrated that protein interaction between ER-Î± and p65 was
  down-regulated by TNF-Î± treatment, and this effect was reversed by allicin.
- Moreover, the inhibition of ER-Î± expression markedly enhanced TNF-Î±-induced migration
  and invasion of MCF-7 cells.
- Allicin strongly suppressed TNF-Î±-induced activation of ERK1/2.
- Collectively, these results suggest that allicin inhibited the TNF-Î±-mediated induction
  of VCAM-1 through blocking ERK1/2 and NF-ÎºB signaling pathways and enhancing interaction
  between ER-Î± and p65, leading to the suppression of invasion and metastasis of
  MCF-7 cells.
- Therefore, allicin could be useful for preventing the advancement of breast cancer.
