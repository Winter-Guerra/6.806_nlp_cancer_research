  Cucurbitacin B (Cuc B) (Fig.'
- 1a) is a natural tetracyclic triterpene compound widely distributed in the plant
  kingdom originally as an antiinflammatory drug [1].
- Accumulated data demonstrates that Cuc B possesses a variety of bioactivities, such
  as anti-inflammatory, hepatoprotective, and anticancer activities.
- In particular, the anticancer properties of Cuc B have drawn attention of many researchers
  in recent years [1, 2].
- Cuc B inhibits proliferation of a series of cancer cell lines, such as laryngeal
  squamous cell carcinoma [3], pancreatic cancer [4], hepatocellular carcinoma [5,
  6], melanoma [7], lung cancer [8], among others.
- 'Furthermore, it enhances the anticancer effects of clinical chemotherapeutic drugs:
  cisplatin, gemcitabine, methotrexate, docetaxel, and gemcitabine [9–12].'
- Documented results also demonstrate that Cuc B potently inhibits the proliferation
  of breast cancer cell lines both in vitro and in vivo [13–17].
- Cuc B suppressed breast cancer cell growth by HER2/integrin signaling, which further
  led to inhibiting integrin-mediated cell survival through ILK1 and paxillin [14],
  by disruption of microtubule polymerization and disturbance of nucleophosmin/B23
  translocation [15], and by inhibiting Wnt signaling [18].

  G2/M-cell -phase arrest, and apoptosis in human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial A549
  cells and K562 leukemia cells [23, 24].

  It has been demonstrated that Cuc B suppressed proliferation of various human breast
  cancer cell lines such as MDA-MB-231, ZR-75-1, MCF-7, T47D, BT474, MDA-MB-453 [13],
  but its underlying mechanism was unclear.'
- In our study, the antiproliferative effect of Cuc B on MCF-7 was confirmed by MTT
  assay and colony-forming assay.
- Both results showed that Cuc B was a potent cytotoxic compound to MCF-7 cells.
- Our previous report found that Cuc B can induce the DNA damage that causes G2/M
  cell-cycle arrest in human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial A549 cells and leukemia
  K562 cells [23, 24].
- Here, using comet assay, we found that Cuc B also induced DNA damage in MCF-7 cells.
- This was further confirmed by increased expression and nuclear translocation of
  γH2AX, a valid biomarker for DNA damage [27, 28].
- ATM and ATR, two large phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase-like kinase family (PIKKs)
  members, are the central regulators of the DNA damage network [29].
- Both are activated by DNA damage and DNA replication stress but with distinct specificities
  and functions, though there are cross-talks in their signaling pathways.
- It was found that ATM-Chk2 and ATR-Chk1 pathways were activated by DSBs and DNA
  single-strand breaks, respectively [29, 30].
- Cuc B treatment induced phosphorylation of both ATM and ATR at Ser1981 and Ser428,
  respectively, suggesting that both pathways were activated.
- This finding was consist with findings of our previous study in K562 [24] and A549
  cells [23].
- Thus, induction of DNA damage might be a common mechanism of Cuc B cytotoxicity.
- Autophagy, a highly regulated process, is an important type of nonapoptotic cell
  death and is implicated in cancer treatment [31, 32].
- Recent reports showed that several cucurbitacins induced autophagy in HeLa [33],
  RAW264.7 [34], Jurkat [35].
- and glioblastoma [36] cells.
- When autophagy is induced, the cytosolic form of LC3 is processed to the lipidated
  and autophagosome-associated form LC3II [37, 38].
- MDC, an autofluorescent probe, is used to the identify the autophagic vesicles and
  assess autophagy induction through measuring the accumulation of MDC-labeled vacuoles
  [39].
- Here, we found that Cuc B induced accumulation of LC3 II and MDC fluorescence, suggesting
  that it induced autophagy.
- AKT/mTOR, ULK1, Beclin1, and p62 are among the key regulators of the autophagic
  process.
- Autophagy induction by mTOR inhibition, resulting from starvation or rapamycin treatment,
  is conserved from yeast to mammals and acts upstream of the_ ULK1_ complex [40].
- Beclin1 interacts with several cofactors to regulate the lipid kin mase Vps34 protein
  and promote formation of Beclin 1-Vps34-Vps15 core complexes, thus inducing autophagy
  [41].
- P62/SQSTM1, as a scaffold protein, associates with proteasomes and that autophagy
  degrades p62/SQSTM1 [42].
- AKT/mTOR and p62 inhibition and ULK1 and Beclin1 activation by Cuc B suggested that
  Cuc B induced autophagy by modulating these molecules.
- In glioblastoma, Cuc I up-regulated Beclin 1 and activated the AMP-activated protein
  kinase/mTOR/p70S6K pathway, but not the PI3K/AKT pathway [36].
- In Jurkat cells, Cuc-B-induced autophagy was associated with G-actin reduction and
  persistent activation of cofilin [35].
- Thus, detailing the pathways of Cuc B in autophagy need further study.
- ROS has been implicated in both the induction of DNA damage and autophagy in several
  types of cancer cells [43–45].
- Previous data suggest that Cuc B increased intracellular ROS levels in SW480, HeLa,
  A549, and K562 cells [23, 24, 33, 46].
- In the study we report here, this effect was confirmed in MCF-7 cells.
- The role of ROS in Cuc-B-induced DNA damage and autophagy was examined by NAC pretreatment.
- NAC not only reversed Cuc-B-induced ROS formation but also reversed DNA damage and
  autophagy.
- Furthermore, it inhibited activation of ATM/ATR and reversed protein expressions
  of AKT/mTOR, Beclin1, p62, and ULK1.
- Taken together, these data indicate that Cuc-B-induced DNA damage and autophagy
  in MCF-7 cells is mediated by ROS generation.
- In conclusion, this study showes that Cuc B induced ROS-mediated DNA damage and
  autophagy in breast cancer MCF-7 cells, thus providing new insight into the anticancer
  effect of Cuc B.
