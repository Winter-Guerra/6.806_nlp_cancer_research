- The isoflavone genistein on the contrary to its well-established health-beneficial
  effects is not a major component of the Western diet, since soy consumption, considered
  as the main dietary source of genistein, in these populations is low.
- Genistein compounds in twelve commercial sour cherry (_Prunus cerasus_ L.) cultivars
  grown in Hungary were studied.
- High performance liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionisation quadrupole/time-of-flight
  mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-qToF-MS) was used for screening and confirmatory analyses.
- "Genistin and genistein were found in 'Pipacs1', 'Kantorjanosi', 'Debreceni bÅ\x91termÅ\x91'
  and 'Éva', which are native cultivars to Hungary."
- Genistein content of the latter three were in the range of 0.4-0.6, while in 'Pipacs1'
  in total 4.4 mg genistein compounds were measured expressed as aglycone equivalents
  per 100 g of fresh fruit flesh.
- These cultivars may play important role as complementary genistein sources in the
  Western diet.
- Especially 'Pipacs 1', may be best utilised in functional food products.
