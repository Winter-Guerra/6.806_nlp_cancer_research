- There is little published information on the prevalence of Salmonella in edible
  nut kernels.
- A study in early 2008 of edible roasted nut kernels on retail sale in England was
  undertaken to assess the microbiological safety of this product.
- A total of 727 nut kernel samples of different varieties were examined.
- Overall, Salmonella and Escherichia coli were detected from 0.2 and 0.4% of edible
  roasted nut kernels.
- Of the nut varieties examined, Salmonella Havana was detected from 1 (4.0%) sample
  of pistachio nuts, indicating a risk to health.
- The United Kingdom Food Standards Agency was immediately informed, and full investigations
  were undertaken.
- Further examination established the contamination to be associated with the pistachio
  kernels and not the partly opened shells.
- Salmonella was not detected in other varieties tested (almonds, Brazils, cashews,
  hazelnuts, macadamia, peanuts, pecans, pine nuts, and walnuts).
- E. coli was found at low levels (range of 3.6 to 4/g) in walnuts (1.4%), almonds
  (1.2%), and Brazils (0.5%).
- The presence of Salmonella is unacceptable in edible nut kernels.
- Prevention of microbial contamination in these products lies in the application
  of good agricultural, manufacturing, and storage practices together with a hazard
  analysis and critical control points system that encompass all stages of production,
  processing, and distribution.
