- Epidemiological studies regarding the association between red and processed meat
  intake and the risk of breast cancer have yielded inconsistent results.
- Therefore, we conducted an updated and comprehensive meta-analysis which included
  14 prospective studies to evaluate the association of red and processed meat intake
  with breast cancer risk.
- Relevant prospective cohort studies were identified by searching PubMed through
  October 31, 2014, and by reviewing the reference lists of retrieved articles.
- Study-specific relative risk (RR) estimates were pooled using a random-effects model.
- Fourteen prospective studies on red meat (involving 31,552 cases) and 12 prospective
  studies on processed meat were included in the meta-analysis.
- The summary RRs (95 % CI) of breast cancer for the highest versus the lowest categories
  were 1.10 (1.02, 1.19) for red meat, and 1.08 (1.01, 1.15) for processed meat.
- The estimated summary RRs (95 % CI) were 1.11 (1.05, 1.16) for an increase of 120
  g/day of red meat, and 1.09 (1.03, 1.16) for an increase of 50 g/day of processed
  meat.
- Our findings indicate that increased intake of red and processed meat is associated
  with an increased risk of breast cancer.
- Further research with well-designed cohort or interventional studies is needed to
  confirm the association.
- Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide.
- It is also the major cause of death from cancer among women globally [1].
- It is reported that one in eight U.S. women (about 12.5 %) will be diagnosed with
  breast cancer in her lifetime [2].
- In 2014, about 232,340 new cases of invasive breast cancer will be diagnosed in
  women, and 39,620 women will die from breast cancer in the United States [2].
- Thus, to facilitate disease prevention, it is of great importance to identify potential
  risk factors for breast cancer, especially the modifiable life-style factors including
  diet [3].
- Recently, an increasing number of studies have been carried out to explore the associations
  between red and/or processed meat intake and the risk of breast cancer, but the
  results have been inconsistent [4–9].
- An early quantitative review done in 2010 demonstrated that red meat and processed
  meat intake does not appear to be independently associated with increased risk of
  breast cancer [9].
- Since then, five more epidemiologic studies evaluating the association of red and
  processed meat intake with breast cancer risk have yielded inconsistent results
  [4–8].
- Of these five studies, two prospective cohort studies in 2014 by Farvid et al.
- (including 88,803 and 44,231 women, respectively) found a positive association between
  red meat intake and breast cancer risk [4, 5].
- Another study using data from the SU.VI.MAX study observed that processed meat intake
  was prospectively associated with increased breast cancer risk [6].
- However, the other two studies reported null associations [7, 8].
- Therefore, we conducted an updated and comprehensive meta-analysis of prospective
  studies to better characterize this issue.
- A computerized literature search was conducted in PubMed (http://​www.​ncbi.​nlm.​nih.​gov/​pubmed)
  from its inception through October 2014, by two independent researchers.
- 'We searched the relevant studies with the following medical subject-heading terms
  and/or text words: (1) breast cancer OR breast neoplasm; (2) meat OR red meat OR
  processed meat OR preserved meat OR pork OR beef OR veal OR mutton OR lamb OR ham
  OR sausage OR bacon; (3) cohort OR prospective OR nested case–control, following
  the meta-analysis of observation studies in epidemiology guidelines [10].'
- Furthermore, we carried out a broader search on diet or foods and breast cancer
  and reviewed lists of the relevant articles to identify additional studies.
- No language restriction was imposed.
- 'Studies were included in the meta-analysis if the studies met the following criteria:
  (1) peer-reviewed publications of prospective cohort studies or nested case–control
  studies; (2) the exposure studied was red meat or processed meat, and the outcome
  of interest was incidence of or mortality from breast cancer; and (3) relative risk
  (RR) with corresponding 95 % CI was presented.'
- If the articles were duplicated or from the same study population, the more recent
  or complete study was included.
- Case–control studies, ecological assessments, correlation studies, experimental
  animal studies, and mechanistic studies were excluded.
- We finally identified 14 prospective studies that reported results for red meat
  or processed meat consumption in relation to risk of breast cancer according to
  the criteria listed above.
- 'Two independent researchers extracted the following data from each study: the first
  author’s last name, year of publication, country where the study was conducted,
  number of cases, cohort size, years of follow-up, type of meat, RR with corresponding
  95 % CIs for the highest versus the lowest level, and adjusted variables.'
- Attempts were also made to contact investigators if the data of interested were
  not directly presented in the publications.
- When several risk estimates were present, the estimates adjusted for the greatest
  number of potential confounders were extracted.
- The Newcastle–Ottawa scale was used to assess the study quality [22].
- A random-effects model was used to calculate the summary relative risks and 95 %
  CIs for the highest _versus_ the lowest level of red and processed meat intake.
- This model was developed by DerSimonian and Laird, which accounts for heterogeneity
  among studies [23].
- For the dose-response meta-analysis, we used generalized least squares trend estimation
  analysis based on the methods proposed by Greenland and Longnecker [24] and Orsini
  [25].
- This method requires the number of cases and non-cases (or person-time) and the
  RR with its variance estimate for at least three quantitative exposure categories.
- When studies did not provide this information, we estimated the slopes using variance-weighted
  least squares regression.
- When the included studies used different units (such as servings and times), we
  converted them into grams per day using 120 or 50 g as the average portion size
  for red meat or processed meat, respectively [26].
- Statistical heterogeneity among studies was evaluated using the Cochran’s Q and
  _I_ 2 statistics [27].
- Heterogeneity was considered present for _P_ &lt; 0.05 or _I_ 2 ≥ 50 %.
- Sources of heterogeneity were explored in stratified analysis by study location,
  menopausal status, and adjusted confounders.
- We also conducted sensitivity analysis to estimate the influence of each individual
  study on the summary results by repeating the random-effects meta-analysis after
  omitting one study at a time.
- Publication bias was assessed using funnel plots, and the further evaluated by Egger’s
  linear regression and Begg’s rank correlation test [28, 29].
- A two-tailed _P_ value &lt; 0.05 was considered representative of significant statistical
  publication bias.
- All statistical analyses were performed using STATA, version 11.0 (STATA, College
  Station, TX).
- The flowchart of the identification of relevant studies is shown in Fig.
- 1
- A total of 172 articles were identified by searching of the database, and 16 of
  these articles were retrieved for full-text review.
- After excluding 2 publications that represented the same population, 14 cohort/nest
  case–control studies were selected for use in our meta-analysis.
- Characteristics of the included studies are shown in Table 1.
- The 14 cohort studies [4, 6, 7, 11–21] comprised a total of 1588,890 participants
  and 31,552 breast cancer cases, and 3 studies were secondary analyses of randomized
  controlled trial data [6, 14, 20].
- Among the 14 studies evaluated, 6 were conducted in the United States, 6 in Europe,
  1 in North America and Western Europe, and 1 in Asia.

- The summary RR of breast cancer was 1.10 (95 % CI, 1.02–1.19) for subjects in the
  highest category of red meat intake compared with those in the lowest category.
- Statistically significant heterogeneity was detected (_P_ = 0.001, _I_ 2 = 62.2
  %).
- No publication bias was observed by Begg’s test (_P_ = 0.44) or by Egger’s test
  (_P_ = 0.08).
- Eleven studies [4, 7, 13–21] were eligible to have required data for dose-response
  analysis, and the estimated summary RR of breast cancer of an increase in red meat
  intake of 120 g/day was 1.11 (95 % CI, 1.05, 1.16); no significant heterogeneity
  was observed (_P_ heterogeneity &gt; 0.1).
- In stratified analysis by menopausal status, the summary RR of breast cancer for
  subjects in the highest category of red meat intake compared with those in the lowest
  category was 1.08 (95 % CI, 0.95–1.22; _n_ = 5, _P_ heterogeneity = 0.22, _I_ 2

  When the overall homogeneity and effect size were calculated by removing one study
  at a time, we confirmed the stability of the positive association between red meat
  intake and breast cancer risk (data not shown).'
- Twelve cohort studies [6, 7, 12–21] that examined the association between processed
  meat intake and the risk of breast cancer were included in the meta-analysis.
- The summary RR of breast cancer was 1.08 (95 % CI, 1.01–1.15) for subjects in the
  highest category of processed meat intake compared with those in the lowest category.
- Statistically significant heterogeneity was detected (_P_ = 0.006, _I_ 2 = 58.3
  %), and publication bias was not evidenced by Begg’s test (_P_ = 0.
- 30), but was observed by Egger’s test (_P_ &lt; 0.01).
- Seven studies [7, 13, 16–20] were eligible to have required data for dose-response
  analysis, and the estimated summary RR of breast cancer of an increase in processed
  meat intake of 50 g/day was 1.09 (95 % CI, 1.03, 1.16); no significant heterogeneity
  was observed (_P_ heterogeneity &gt; 0.1) (Fig.

  In stratified analysis by menopausal status, the summary RR of breast cancer for
  subjects in the highest category of processed meat intake compared with those in
  the lowest category was 1.03 (95 % CI, 0.89–1.18; _n_ = 3, _P_ heterogeneity = 0.29,
  _I_ 2 = 20.4 %) for premenopausal women, and 1.23 (95 % CI, 0.98–1.55; n = 4, _P_
  heterogeneity = 0.06, _I_ 2 = 60.4 %) for postmenopausal women.'
- Furthermore, in stratified analysis by geographic region, the summary RR was 1.04
  (95 % CI, 0.97–1.12) (_n_ = 4, _P_ heterogeneity = 0.8, _I_ 2 = 0.0 %) for studies
  conducted in the United States, and 1.16 (95 % CI, 1.05–1.28) (_n_ = 6, _P_ heterogeneity
  = 0.21, _I_ 2 = 30.4 %) for studies conducted in the Europe (Fig.

- (_SE_ standard error, _rr_/_RR_ relative risk.)
- In this comprehensive updated meta-analysis, higher red and processed meat intake
  was found to be associated with an increased risk of breast cancer.
- The summary risk of breast cancer for the highest _versus_ the lowest categories
  increased by 10 % for red meat, and 8 % for processed meat.
- The results were consistent when using dose-response analysis.
- A previous meta-analysis of red and processed meat consumption and breast cancer
  was conducted by Alexander et al.
- in 2009 [9].
- That study found weak positive summary associations across all meta-analysis models,
  with the majority being non-statistically significant.
- Moreover, only 11 studies were included in the previous meta-analysis.
- However, since then, a number of large-scale prospective epidemiologic studies have
  evaluated the association between red and processed meat intake and breast cancer
  risk.
- For example, one study with 20 years of follow-up among 88,803 premenopausal women
  from the Nurses’ Health Study II found that greater intake of total red meat was
  associated with an increased risk of breast cancer (highest vs. lowest quintiles,
  RR, 1.22; 95 % CI, 1.06–1.40; _P_ trend = 0.01) [4].
- Another study with 13-year follow-up by Farvid MS et al.
- (including 44,231 women) also observed that higher consumption of total red meat
  in adolescence was significantly associated with increased premenopausal breast
  cancer risk (highest vs. lowest quintiles, RR, 1.43; 95 % CI, 1.05–1.94; _P_ trend
  = 0.007) [5].
- Using the data from the SU.VI.MAX study, Pouchieu C et al.
- demonstrated that processed meat intake was prospectively associated with increased
  breast cancer risk (highest vs. lowest quartiles, RR, 1.45; 95 % CI, 0.92–2.27,
  _P_ trend = 0.03) [6].
- In the current updated meta-analysis, after excluding the studies from the same
  study population, we finally included 14 prospective studies and found statistically
  significant relationship between red and processed meat consumption and breast cancer
  risk (highest vs. lowest categories, summary RR, 1.10; 95 % CI, 1.02–1.19 for red
  meat, and summary RR, 1.08; 95 % CI, 1.01–1.15 for processed meat).
- Several suggested biological mechanisms might explain the positive association between
  red meat or processed meat intake and breast cancer risk.
- The first mechanism concerns the heme iron and non-heme iron.
- Iron, which has a pro-oxidant activity, has been suggested as a risk factor for
  many types of cancers [30].
- However, epidemiological studies have yielded mixed and contentious results regarding
  the relationship between iron and breast cancer [20].
- Moreover, a cohort study included in our meta-analysis revealed that adjusting for
  heme iron did not appreciably change the association between red meat intake and
  breast cancer risk [4], indicating that heme iron might not be a major causal fact
  for the association between red meat intake and breast cancer risk.
- Another important mechanism that may explain the positive association relates to
  the presence of some carcinogenic compounds like the heterocyclic amines (HCAs)
  and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), by-products that are produced in the
  process of high-temperature cooking of red meat [31, 32].
- Several human studies have demonstrated a positive association between HCA and PAH
  intake and overall breast cancer risks [31, 33–38].
- In addition, hormone residues of the exogenous hormones used to treat beef cattle
  also are recognized as possible sources of the positive association between red
  meat intake and breast cancer risk [39, 40].
- Recently, a new study published on PNAS has revealed that the animal sugar molecule
  _N_-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc), which is highly enriched in red meat, would
  be absorbed and accumulated in human tissues, and eventually lead to chronic inflammation
  and tumor formation [41].
- Our meta-analysis has several strengths.
- Firstly, the assessment was based on prospective studies, which tend to be less
  likely to have recall and selection bias than retrospective case–control studies.
- Moreover, our studies included a large sample size (1588,890 participants and 31,552
  breast cancer cases) which would have a much greater possibility of reaching detecting
  smaller associations and performing subgroup analysis.
- However, there were also some limitations in this meta-analysis.
- First, the inherent problems of residual confounders in the included studies are
  of concern in the meta-analysis of observational studies.
- Most of the studies included in our meta-analysis controlled for a wide range of
  confounders (such as age, BMI, and total energy intake), and some of these studies
  even had controlled for postmenopausal hormone treatment and Hormone replacement
  therapy (of note, adjustment for all possible confounders might result in over-adjustment.).
- However, we still cannot exclude the possibility that other inadequately measured
  factors such as environmental pollution [42, 43] and sleep quality [44], which might
  confound the association, should be included in the future studies.
- Second, our findings are likely to be affected by the misclassification of meat.
- In the studies included in our meta-analysis, the term “red meat” referred to total
  red meat, corresponding to processed red meat in some studies and to unprocessed
  red meat in other studies.
- However, misclassification is generally non-differential in cohort studies, which
  would most likely attenuate the association.
- Third, the intake quantity and consumption levels in the highest and lowest categories
  varied across studies, which might contribute the heterogeneity among studies in
  the analysis of the highest _versus_ the lowest intake categories.
- To account for these differences, we also estimated the relative risks of breast
  cancer for an increase intake of red meat of 120 g/day and of processed meat of
  50 g/day, and similar results were observed.
- Finally, as with any meta-analysis, publication bias could be of concern, because
  studies with null results or small sample sizes tend not to be published.
- Thus, the summary results may overestimate the relative risk of breast cancer with
  red and/or processed meat intake.
- In conclusion, the overall results of the present study suggest that high intake
  of red and/or processed meat is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer.
- However, additional well-designed cohort or interventional studies will be needed
  to confirm the association.
