- Resveratrol and pterostilbene exhibit numerous biological effects, including antiproliferative
  and proapoptotic activities, in various experimental settings.
- Mammalian Mediator subunit MED28 is highly expressed in several types of tumor including
  breast cancer.
- Recently, we have reported that MED28 regulates cellular migration and invasion
  in human breast cancer cells, whereas resveratrol can inhibit the effect.
- In the current study we investigated the effect of resveratrol and pterostilbene
  on MED28 expression and cell growth in human breast cancer cells.
- MED28 suppression delayed cell cycle progression, and reduced the expression of
  cyclin D1 and p-RelA/p65 as well as the transcriptional activity of NFÎºB, but increased
  the levels of p27 and FOXO3a.
- Overexpression of MED28 enhanced S phase entry and increased p-p65 expression.
- Resveratrol and pterostilbene reduced the expression of MED28 and cyclin D1, and
  mediated the transcriptional activity of NFÎºB, thereby suppressing the growth-promoting
  role of MED28.
