- Several epidemiologic studies have reported a positive association between breast
  cancer risk and high intake of sweets, which may be due to an insulin-related mechanism.
- We investigated this association in a population-based case–control study of 1,434
  cases and 1,440 controls from Long Island, NY.
- Shortly after diagnosis, subjects were interviewed in-person to assess potential
  breast cancer risk factors, and self-completed a modified Block food frequency questionnaire,
  which included 11 items pertaining to consumption of sweets (sweet beverages, added
  sugars, and various desserts) in the previous year.
- Using unconditional logistic regression models, we estimated the association between
  consumption of sweets and breast cancer.
- 'Consumption of a food grouping that included dessert foods, sweet beverages, and
  added sugars was positively associated with breast cancer risk [adjusted odds ratio
  (OR) comparing the highest to the lowest quartile: 1.27, 95% confidence interval
  (CI): 1.00–1.61].'
- 'The OR was slightly higher when only dessert foods were considered (OR: 1.55, 95%
  CI: 1.23–1.96).'
- 'The association with desserts was stronger among pre-menopausal women (OR: 2.00,
  95% CI: 1.32–3.04) than post-menopausal women (OR: 1.40, 95% CI: 1.07–1.83), although
  the interaction with menopause was not statistically significant.'
- Our study indicates that frequent consumption of sweets, particularly desserts,
  may be associated with an increased risk of breast cancer.
- These results are consistent with other studies that implicate insulin-related factors
  in breast carcinogenesis.
- Research suggests that diets high in refined sugars, sweets, and desserts may increase
  a woman’s risk for breast cancer [1–6], although several null findings [7–9] have
  resulted in a lack of consensus on the issue.
- Dietary behaviors that result in elevated blood glucose levels, such as frequent
  consumption of refined carbohydrates, consequently increase plasma insulin.
- Hyperinsulinemia may be a risk factor for breast cancer as insulin is mitogenic,
  thereby encouraging cellular proliferation and promoting tumor growth; excess insulin
  is also indirectly related to increased levels of free estrogen through inhibition
  of the production of sex-hormone binding globulin [10].
- Chronically elevated insulin may be one of the pathways involved in the observed
  associations between energy balance and breast carcinogenesis as evidenced by the
  results from a recent meta-analysis on C-peptide and insulin levels and breast cancer
  risk [11], although the positive association was limited to case–control studies.
- Thus recent research has focused on evaluating lifestyle factors, such as dietary
  behaviors, that may influence insulin exposure.
- We evaluated the association between increasing consumption of sweet foods and breast
  cancer risk in a large, population-based case–control study of breast cancer among
  women residing in Long Island, NY.
- We also examined the potential for effect modification by exposures known to be
  associated with hyperinsulinemia or related hormonal pathways.
- The Long Island Breast Cancer Study Project (LIBCSP) is a population-based case–control
  study of breast cancer conducted in Nassau and Suffolk counties in New York [12].
- The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of participating institutions.
- Cases were English-speaking adult women with a first primary in situ or invasive
  breast cancer diagnosed between 1996 and 1997.
- Potentially eligible women were identified through pathology departments of participating
  hospitals and their physicians were contacted to confirm the diagnosis and obtain
  permission to contact the patients for participation in the study.
- Controls were frequency matched to the expected distribution of cases in 5-year
  age groups in 1996–1997; potentially eligible controls under the age of 65 were
  identified by random digit dialing, while those over age 65 were identified from
  the Health Care Finance Administration rosters.
- A total of 1,508 eligible cases (82.1%) and 1,556 eligible controls (62.7%) agreed
  to participate in the study.
- Participants ranged in age from 20 to 98 years, and 94% were white and 4% were African
  American.
- Signed informed consent was obtained for all subjects prior to data collection.
- Risk factor information was assessed by structured questionnaire, which was administered
  by trained interviewers during in-home visits.
- Information collected included menstrual and reproductive history, exogenous hormone
  use, cigarette smoking, alcohol use, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) use,
  anthropometric measures, and physical activity (http://​epi.​grants.​cancer.​gov/​LIBCSP/​projects/​Questionnaire.​html).
- Factors found to increase breast cancer risk in this study population have been
  previously published [12].
- For case women who signed a medical record release form (97.7%), tumor stage and
  hormone receptor status were ascertained from the medical records.
- Approximately 98% of the respondents completed a self-administered modified Block
  food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) that took an average of approximately 30 minutes
  to complete [12].
- The FFQ assessed frequency and relative portion size for 101 food items in the year
  prior to the interview, with line items for sweet foods including desserts (ice
  cream, low-fat ice cream/frozen yogurt/frozen tofu/sherbet, pies, doughnuts, and
  pastry, chocolate cake/brownies/cookies, chocolate candy), sweetened beverages (fruit
  drinks, regular sweetened soft drinks), and added sweeteners (sugar added to cereal,
  sugar added to coffee or tea).
- Food groupings were developed to be consistent with previous studies [2, 3] and
  to help distinguish the effect of desserts, which are more calorie and sugar rich,
  from total intake of sweets.
- For each line item, we created a variable representing the number of average sized
  servings per week by multiplying the relative portion size (less then average =
  0.5, average = 1.0, larger than average = 2.0) by the number of servings per week
  reported.
- We summed these variables to define number of servings per week of food groups corresponding
  to total sweets (all items) as well as dessert foods only.
- To eliminate the influence of outliers, we excluded those subjects where the log-transformed
  total energy intake was more than three standard deviations of the log-transformed
  mean (45 cases and 56 controls).
- We also eliminated those subjects with missing data on menopausal status (30 cases
  and 63 controls) yielding a final sample of 1,434 cases and 1,440 controls.
- Unconditional logistic regression [13], adjusting for age at reference date (date
  of diagnosis for cases, date of interview for controls) in 5-year categories, was
  used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the association
  between sweets and breast cancer.
- Intake of total sweets and desserts were categorized according to quartiles of intake
  among all controls.
- 'Potential confounders included total energy (kcal, continuous), family history
  of breast cancer (yes/no), parity (nulliparous/parous), oral contraceptive use (ever/never),
  body mass index 1 year prior to reference date (BMI, kg/m2: &lt;25, 25–29, &gt;30),
  physical activity from menarche to reference date (0, 0.01–7.55, &gt;7.55 METS),
  weight change since age 20 (categorized as &lt;3 kg increase, 3–14.4 kg increase,
  &gt;14.4 kg increase), fruit and vegetable intake (0–14, &gt;14 servings per week),
  meat intake (grams per day, continuous), alcohol use (ever/never), and smoking (ever/never).'
- Only total energy intake notably altered the effect estimates (&gt;10% change),
  therefore our final models are adjusted for age and energy intake.
- Tests for linear trend were conducted using the continuous variable in the model
  and examining the _p_-value for the corresponding beta coefficient from the logistic
  regression model [14].
- We used multinomial logistic regression to examine if the effects differed by in
  situ (_n_ = 235) or invasive (_n_ = 1,270) cancers by estimating multinomial models
  allowing the effect to vary by in situ or invasive type and separate models restricting
  the effect to be the same for both types.
- These models were then compared using a likelihood ratio test.
- All statistical analyses were conducted using Stata version 9.2 (College Station,
  TX).
- Multiplicative interaction [14] between sweets consumption and select variables
  was assessed using the likelihood ratio test to compare models with and without
  interaction terms; these interactions were deemed significant for _p_-values &lt;0.10.
- 'Potential effect modifiers included factors thought to directly or indirectly affect
  endogenous insulin exposure: menopausal status, body mass index, weight change since
  age 20, physical activity, and alcohol intake.'
- 'As shown in Table 1, we observed a modest increase in the risk of breast cancer
  with increasing frequency of consumption of total sweets among all women (OR comparing
  the highest to the lowest quartile: 1.27, 95% CI: 1.00–1.61).'
- 'We noted a slightly higher effect among pre-menopausal women (OR: 1.43, 95% CI:
  0.95–2.14) when compared with post-menopausal women (OR: 1.24, 95% CI: 0.94–1.64),
  although the test for interaction was not statistically significant.'
- The observed association was stronger when only dessert foods were considered.
- 'Among all women, those in the highest quartile of dessert consumption showed a
  55% increase in risk of breast cancer compared to those with the lowest quartile
  of intake (OR: 1.55, 95% CI: 1.23–1.96).'
- 'We again found a stronger association among pre-menopausal women (OR: 2.00, 95%
  CI: 1.32–3.04) when compared with post-menopausal women (OR: 1.40, 95% CI: 1.07–1.83),
  however, effect modification by menopausal status was not significant.'
- The observed patterns generally suggest that risk increases monotonically with increasing
  consumption although tests for linear trend were not statistically significant.
- In analyses that considered individual food items, no single sweet item appeared
  to be responsible for the associations noted with total sweets or desserts (data
  not shown).
- The multinomial logistic regression models comparing the effects between in situ
  and invasive cancers showed no significant difference in effect of total sweets
  (likelihood ratio _p_-value = 0.66) or desserts only (likelihood ratio _p_-value
  = 0.71).
- "Age and energy adjusted OR for association between sweets consumption and breast
  cancer, for all women and separately by menopausal status, Long Island Breast Cancer

  by BMI, weight change since age 20, physical activity, and alcohol consumption are
  presented in Table 2."
- 'For total sweets intake, only physical activity was observed to modify the association
  with breast cancer risk (_p_ for interaction: 0.01), with more active women apparently
  more susceptible to the negative effect of frequent sweets consumption (lowest strata
  of physical activity, OR: 0.71, 95% CI: 0.46–1.09; highest strata of physical activity,
  OR: 1.85, 95% CI: 1.25–2.74).'

  per week among all controls\n\n\nFor dessert consumption, heterogeneity across strata
  of other factors that could potentially impact endogenous insulin levels was evident
  not only for physical activity, but also body size, adult weight gain, and alcohol."
- 'For example, the association with breast cancer risk was essentially null across
  all levels of intake among inactive women, whereas among the most active women,
  we observed a nearly doubling of risk comparing the highest to the lowest quartile
  of dessert intake (OR: 1.91, 95% CI: 1.30–2.82).'
- 'For body size, women with lower BMI exhibited a stronger association with dessert
  consumption compared to those with higher BMI (low BMI stratum, OR: 1.85, 95% CI:
  1.32–2.57; high BMI stratum, OR: 1.39, 95% CI: 1.03–1.87; _p_ for interaction: 0.06).'
- 'Greater adult weight gain appears to somewhat attenuate the effect of increasing
  dessert consumption (among those with less than 3 kg gain, OR: 1.70, 95% CI: 1.02–2.81;
  among those with &gt;14.4 kg gain, OR: 1.30, 95% CI: 0.92–1.83; _p_ for interaction:
  0.099) which is not observed when all sweet foods are considered.'
- 'For alcohol, ever drinkers showed a significantly greater risk of breast cancer
  across all levels of dessert intake compared to those women who reported never drinking
  alcohol (_p_ for interaction: 0.01).'
- In a large, population-based case–control study of breast cancer, we found a positive
  association between consumption of sweet foods, especially desserts and breast cancer
  risk among both pre- and post-menopausal women.
- The adverse effects may be stronger among women who are more physically active;
  for desserts, high risk subgroups may also include women who are leaner and those
  who reported ever having consumed alcohol.
- Our results are consistent with other recent epidemiologic research [1–5].
- In a population-based case–control study of breast cancer among American women under
  age 45, Potischman [2] observed a 32% increase in risk of breast cancer among those
  who consumed the most sweets, when compared with the least.
- A 2005 report of an Italian hospital-based case–control study [3] also showed a
  19% increase among those in the highest tertile of intake of dessert foods.
- 'In a Canadian case–control study, Lubin [5] reported a positive association with
  sweet desserts of a magnitude similar to what we observe in our data (OR the highest
  to the lowest tertile: 1.50).'
- Some authors have postulated that these results could be due to other characteristics
  of these foods, such as fat content, however, the associations for lower-fat foods,
  such as sweetened beverages and sugar intake [1, 4] would be more consistent with
  an insulin-related pathway.
- There may also be a synergistic effect of high-sugar and high-calorie foods on breast
  cancer development, which could explain the stronger effects for desserts.
- Inconsistent findings between consumption of sweets and breast cancer in the epidemiologic
  literature may be due to differences in exposure definitions, which have included
  intake of sugars [1, 6], sweets and desserts [2–5], individual foods [3] or an overall
  dietary pattern that included high intake of sweets [7–9].
- The studies of individual foods [1, 3] or food groups [1–5] tended to show positive
  associations between sweets consumption and breast cancer incidence, while a similar
  association was not seen in those studies that evaluated overall dietary patterns
  that reflected frequent sweets consumption [7–9].
- Variations in exposure definitions used across studies may correspond to differences
  in underlying biologic effects.
- Case–control studies that examined overall measures of dietary glycemic burden,
  such as total carbohydrate intake, glycemic index (GI), and glycemic load (GL),
  have generally shown a positive association with breast cancer risk [1, 8, 15].
- In contrast, many cohort studies [16–22], with a few exceptions [23–26], report
  null associations between total carbohydrate intake, GI, GL and breast cancer risk
  [27].
- It is possible that differential recall in case–control studies or the fact that
  prospective observation may alter usual behavior in cohort studies could explain
  some of these discrepancies.
- Alternatively, the inconsistent associations with cancer incidence in the epidemiologic
  literature may be explained by the use of the GI and/or the GL themselves, which
  is a controversial practice.
- Because these measures pertain only to individual foods and not combinations of
  foods (as they are typically eaten in a mixed meal), some researchers believe that
  they may not accurately reflect the glycemic burden of an individual diet [28].
- Further, the postprandial glycemic response to foods explains only about 23% of
  the variation in insulin levels [29], as noted by other authors [30].
- Analyses that account for food groupings and dietary patterns may identify exposures
  that affect a multitude of factors that affect disease risk more than when nutrients
  or characteristics of the foods are considered individually [31].
- Notably, a recent analysis that combined dietary pattern analysis with GI and GL
  showed that the dietary patterns identified (where sweet foods contributed the most
  to the factor loadings) were associated with increased breast cancer risk among
  pre-menopausal women more so than when the simple GI and GL were considered [8].
- Our findings for effect modification by body size and physical activity are somewhat
  unexpected, given that a recent case–control study did not find similar patterns
  [3], although the discrepancy may be due to differences in study design.
- The previous study [3] was hospital-based whereas our study was population-based.
- Given that body size and physical activity are known to contribute to multiple chronic
  diseases, the distribution of these factors among a control sample that is population-based,
  rather than hospital-based, is likely to better represent the underlying distribution
  of the source population from which the cases are drawn [14].
- However, although the potential interactions between sweets intake and body size
  and/or physical activity appear plausible, our results on more pronounced effects
  among special subgroups of women need confirmation by other investigations.
- In addition to functioning as a tumor promoter by itself, insulin increases the
  activity of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), which also functions as a tumor
  promoter [10] and has been associated with breast cancer in several epidemiologic
  studies [32, 33].
- Our results for insulin-related dietary exposures are also consistent with other
  findings from the LIBCSP, which found an increased risk of breast cancer among pre-menopausal
  women with polymorphisms for IGF-I [34], which is in agreement with evidence for
  IGF-I in most other studies [33, 35].
- Our analysis benefits from a large, population-based sample that includes both pre-
  and post-menopausal women and comprehensive assessment of anthropometric, lifestyle,
  and dietary factors.
- One limitation is the potential for measurement error through use of a FFQ to ascertain
  usual diet.
- Although this is a concern, FFQs adequately rank dietary intakes [36], which is
  the approach we used for our analysis.
- In case–control studies the potential for bias due to differential recall is always
  present, where subjects with disease may recall unhealthy behaviors with greater
  frequency when compared with controls.
- Additionally, although the completion of the self-administered FFQ was over 98%
  among both case and control respondents, the response rate to the main questionnaire
  among controls was lower than expected, primarily among older women [12].
- Thus, there may be selection bias due to non-response in our data, but its potential
  influence would primarily affect our results among women 65 years of age of older.
- Selection bias among controls has the potential to induce a spurious association
  [37], yet our observed effects were more pronounced among pre-menopausal women,
  the group for whom response rates were about 80% and thus control selection was
  not an issue.
- Therefore, we believe it unlikely that our findings, particularly among younger
  women, are the result of selection bias.
- In summary, our results suggest that high consumption of sweet foods, particularly
  desserts, may be positively associated with breast cancer risk, and the effect may
  be most pronounced among leaner and more physically active women.
- The implications of these findings may be that the greatest reduction in breast
  cancer risk involves regular physical activity [38] and maintenance of a healthy
  weight [39] combined with a diet low in sweets and desserts.
- These results lend additional evidence to the role of insulin in breast carcinogenesis
  and may highlight an area for potential intervention.
