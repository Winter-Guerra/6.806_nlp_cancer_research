- Studies of dietary fat intake and breast cancer have been inconsistent and few have
  examined specific fatty acids.
- We examined the association between specific monounsaturated (MUFA), polyunsaturated
  (PUFA), saturated (SFA), and trans-fatty acids (TFA) and breast cancer risk.
- Participants, 50–76 yr, were female members of the VITamins And Lifestyle (VITAL)
  Cohort, who were postmenopausal at baseline.
- In 2000–2002, participants completed a food frequency questionnaire.
- Seven hundred seventy-two incident, primary breast cancer cases were identified
  using a population-based cancer registry.
- Cox proportional hazard models estimated hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals
  (95% CI) for the association between fatty acid intake and breast cancer risk.
- 'Intake of total MUFAs (highest vs. lowest quintile: HR = 1.61, 95% CI: 1.08–2.38,
  _P_ trend = 0.02), particularly myristoleic and erucic acids, was associated with
  increased breast cancer risk.'
- 'Whereas total SFA was suggestive of an increased risk (HR = 1.47, 95% CI: 1.00–2.15,
  _P_ trend = 0.09), strong associations were observed for palmitic, margaric, and
  stearic acids.'
- Total TFA and PUFA intake were not associated with breast cancer.
- However, among TFAs, linolelaidic acid was positively associated with risk; among
  PUFAs, intake of eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids were inversely associated
  with risk.
- Our findings show that fatty acids are heterogeneous in their association with postmenopausal
  breast cancer risk.

- Because of the scarcity of prospective studies that have looked at breast cancer
  in relation to intake of specific fatty acids, we conducted an investigation of
  these associations within the prospective VITamins And Lifestyle (VITAL) cohort
  study.
- The FFQ used in our study yields nutrients based on an updated nutrient composition
  database that contains data for a large number of fatty acids.
- In addition, the FFQ was formulated to ask participants about their fat consumption
  and food preparation to provide more information on the quantity and types of fat
  consumed.
- Participants in this study were female members of the VITAL cohort, a study of men
  and women, which was designed to investigate prospectively the association between
  supplement use and cancer risk.
- Study methods have been detailed previously (3333\.

- Women, who were 50–76 years of age and living in the 13-county area covered by the
  Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) cancer registry, were eligible
  to participate.
- Between October 2000 and December 2002 we mailed baseline questionnaires and post-card
  reminders 2 wk later to 168,953 women, using names identified from a commercial
  mailing list.
- Of these, 40,337 (23.9%) were returned and deemed eligible.
- Women were excluded if they had a history of breast cancer at baseline (_n_ = 3,078)
  or if this information was missing (_n_ = 86), if they were premenopausal (_n_ =
  1,347), perimenopausal (_n_ = 1,009), or were missing menopausal status (_n_ = 564).
- Women were considered postmenopausal if they had experienced a natural menopause
  with no menstruation in the year prior to the study, received hormone therapy, had
  undergone bilateral oophorectomy, or were ≥60 yr at baseline.
- A woman who had experienced a hysterectomy without an oophorectomy was characterized
  as postmenopausal if she had ever received hormone therapy or if she was ≥55 yr
  at baseline.
- In addition, we excluded women if they failed to successfully complete the baseline
  FFQ (_n_ = 3,755).
- All participants gave informed consent and study procedures were approved by the
  Institutional Review Board at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.
- Additional exclusions were made for women with postbaseline diagnoses of atypical
  breast cancer histologies, including sarcoma, phyllodes, or lymphoma (_n_ = 6),
  and women diagnosed with incident in situ breast cancer (_n_ = 240).
- After these exclusions, 30,252 women were available for study.
- Dietary intakes were assessed using a semiquantitative FFQ, adapted from instruments
  developed for the WHI and other studies (3434\.

- View all references).
- Participants reported their usual frequency and portion size (small, medium, or
  large relative to a given portion size and to photographs of portion sizes) of 120
  foods and beverages consumed during the year prior to baseline.
- The questionnaire was formulated to improve measurement of fatty acid intake.
- This was accomplished in part by use of questions to delineate the amount of fats
  consumed (e.g., how often participants ate the skin when eating chicken), food preparation
  (e.g., fried fish vs. not fried) and types of fat added in cooking or at the table
  (e.g., 9 options for type of fat used in cooking).
- Also for 13 types of food, we used adjustment questions or multiple food items to
  differentiate the use of lower-fat from regular fat products (e.g., salad dressings,
  lunch meats, frozen desserts).
- The average daily intake of specific fatty acids was calculated by multiplying the
  adjusted serving size of each specific food by its fatty acid content.
- The fatty acid and nutrient composition of each food was determined by using the
  Minnesota Nutrient Data System for Research (3737\.
- Schakel , SF , Buzzard , IM and Gebhardt , SE .
- 1997
- Procedures for estimating nutrient values for food composition databases.
- '_J Food Composition Anal_, 10: 102–114.'
- View all references).
- The sum of fat intake within a category of fats [SFA, MUFA, PUFA, trans (TFA)] was
  determined by adding up the fatty acids specific to each category.
- Because fish oil supplements contain high doses of the ω-3 PUFAs eicosapentaenoic
  acid (EPA; PUFA 20:5) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; PUFA 22:6), we added supplemental
  intake to dietary intake to yield total EPA intake and total DHA intake.
- Participants were asked to report the frequency (days per wk) and duration (yr)
  of fish oil supplement use in the past 10 yr. Because data on supplement dose was
  not available, we estimated doses of EPA and DHA based on the average suggested
  daily dose among the most popular brands of fish oil supplements (0.64 g/day and
  0.35 g/day, respectively).
- Participants also reported on personal characteristics, including known or suspected
  breast cancer risk factors.
- Participants answered questions on height and weight at baseline; from these data,
  body mass index (BMI, kg/m2) was computed.
- Participants additionally responded to questions on their medical history, including
  breast cancer screening, having had a benign breast biopsy, hormone therapy use,
  reproductive history, and family history of breast cancer.
- Participants reported on their physical activity over the past 10 yr, including
  type of activity in minutes/day, days/week, and years in duration.
- From these data, average MET hr/wk over the 10 yr prior to baseline was computed.
- Use of any nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID), including low-dose and regular-strength
  aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, or COX-2 inhibitors, such as celecoxib (Celebrex),
  for ≥4 days/wk for ≥4 yr was considered regular use.
- Cohort members were followed for incident breast cancer diagnoses from baseline
  to December 31, 2007, with a mean follow-up time of 6 yr.
- Incident, primary, invasive breast cancers were ascertained by linking the study
  cohort to the western Washington region of the SEER cancer registry, maintained
  by the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.
- This registry covers all incident cancer cases except nonmelanoma skin cancer diagnosed
  within the 13-county area of western Washington State.
- Cases were ascertained through all area hospitals, offices of pathologists, oncologists,
  and radiotherapists, and from state death certificates.
- Extensive quality-control procedures ensure that registry data are accurate and
  complete.
- Linkage of participants in the VITAL and SEER databases is mostly automated and
  based on information such as name, social security number, and date of birth.
- In the instance of a partial match, records were visually inspected.
- Between November 2000 and December 2007, 772 eligible cases of invasive breast cancer
  were ascertained.
- 'Other than the 2.5% of the cohort that developed breast cancer, the study participants
  were censored on the earliest of the following dates: requested removal from the
  study (0.04%), died (4.5%), moved out of the SEER catchment area (5.3%), or the
  date of complete endpoint ascertainment, December 31, 2007 (87.8%).'
- Deaths were determined by linking VITAL data to the Washington State death files.
- Individuals who moved out of the area were identified by linkage to the National
  Change of Address System and follow-up telephone calls.
- Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate breast cancer HR and 95% CI
  associated with participant characteristics and fatty acids from diet.
- Age was used as the survival time metric, with participants entering regression
  models at the age they completed the baseline questionnaire and exiting at the age
  of a censoring event.
- Statistical analyses were performed using SAS v.9.1 (SAS, Cary, NC).
- Dietary intake of specific fatty acids was categorized into quintiles.
- We selected for a priori potential confounding factors, including known and suspected
  risk factors for breast cancer.
- Models were adjusted for age (yr), race (white, nonwhite), education (&lt;college
  graduate, ≥college graduate), height (&lt;1.60,.60 ≤ 1.65, 1.65 ≤ 1.67, &gt;1.67
  m), BMI (&lt;25, 25 ≤ 30, ≥30 kg/m2), age at menarche (≤11, 12, 13, 14+ yr), age
  at first birth (≤19, 20–24, 25–34, ≥35 yr, nulligravid), age at menopause (≤44,
  45–49, ≥50 yr), history of hysterectomy (none, simple hysterectomy, oophorectomy,
  or total hysterectomy), combined hormonal therapy (never, 1 ≤ 5, 5–10, &gt;10 yr),
  estrogen-only hormonal therapy (never, 1 ≤ 5, 5–10, &gt;10 yr), number of first-degree
  relatives with a history of breast cancer (none, 1, ≥2), history of mammography
  (yes/no), history of benign biopsy (yes/no), use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory
  drugs (irregular/regular), physical activity (0, 0 ≤ 2.39, 2.39–6.13, 6.13 ≤ 14.10,
  &gt;14.10 MET-hr/wk), alcohol consumption (0 ≤ 0.5, 0.5 ≤ 1.5, 1.5 ≤ 5, 5 ≤ 10,
  ≥10 g/day), total energy intake (&lt;1015, 1015 ≤ 1284, 1284 ≤ 1552, 1552 ≤ 1910
  calories per day), vegetable intake (&lt;1.08, 1.08 ≤ 1.62, 1.62 ≤ 2.23, 2.23 ≤
  3.26, &gt;3.26 servings per day), and fruit intake (&lt;0.70, 0.70 ≤ 1.20, 1.20
  ≤ 1.91, 1.91 ≤ 2.87, &gt;2.87 servings per day).
- All reported _P_ values are 2-sided.
- _P_-values for trend (_P_ trend) were calculated by treating categorical variables
  as ordinal in the regression models.
- Selected characteristics of VITAL participants and age-adjusted HRs and 95% CI for
  the association between these characteristics and breast cancer risk are given in
  Table 1.
- Consistent with the literature, increasing age, white race, older age at first birth
  (or nulliparity), increasing numbers of first-degree relatives with breast cancer,
  increasing body mass and alcohol intake were all associated with elevated risks
  of breast cancer.
- 'Anna K. Sczanieckaae, Theodore M. Braskyab, Johanna W. Lampeac, Ruth E. Pattersond
  &amp; Emily Whiteac











  The associations between dietary fats and breast cancer risk are presented in Table
  2.'
- None of the hazard ratios adjusted only for age were significant, but most became
  stronger after multivariable adjustment, primarily because of inclusion of energy
  intake in the model.
- 'After full adjustment, total fat intake was not associated with breast cancer risk
  (Quintile 5 vs. Quintile 1: HR = 1.43, 95% CI: 0.95–2.14, _P_ trend = 0.10).'
- 'Anna K. Sczanieckaae, Theodore M. Braskyab, Johanna W. Lampeac, Ruth E. Pattersond
  &amp; Emily Whiteac











  We further examined the association of the four main groups of fatty acids and specific
  fatty acids, listed in footnotes c, d, e, and f of Table 2 with breast cancer risk.'
- Only the fatty acids that are the main dietary contributors to each category are
  given, with the exception of PUFAs EPA, DHA, and arachidonic acid, which are of
  particular interest in breast cancer research.
- 'Dietary intake of total MUFAs was significantly associated with an increased risk
  of breast cancer; comparing the highest vs. the lowest quintile of intake, the HR
  was 1.61 (95% CI: 1.08–2.38, _P_ trend 0.02; Table 2).'
- Intake of the most abundant MUFA, oleic acid (MUFA 18:1) was suggestive of an increased
  risk of breast cancer, but the _P_ for trend was not significant (_P_ trend = 0.08).
- 'Among the MUFAs consumed in smaller quantities (data not shown), myristoleic acid
  (MUFA 14:1) was associated with an increased breast cancer risk (Quintile 5 vs.
  Quintile 1: HR = 1.54, 95% CI: 1.16–2.05, _P_ trend &lt; 0.01) and erucic acid (MUFA
  22:1) was associated with a reduction in risk (Quintile 5 vs. Quintile 1: HR = 0.67,
  95% CI: 0.52–0.87, _P_ trend &lt; 0.01).'
- Intake of other MUFAs was not significantly associated with breast cancer risk.
- 'In addition, none of the 10 foods highest in total MUFAs in the food database were
  associated with breast cancer (Supplemental Table), with the exception of fried
  chicken (Quintile 5 vs. Quintile 1: HR = 1.28, 95% CI: 0.95–1.73, _P_ trend = 0.02).'
- For total SFA and TFA intake, some point estimates were elevated (Table 2), but
  the _P_ values for trend did not reach statistical significance (_P_ trend = 0.09

- 'The 2 fatty acids that contribute the most to SFA intake (mean g/day in VITAL women),
  palmitic acid (SFA 16:0) and stearic acid (SFA 18:0), were each significantly and

- 'Of the SFAs consumed in smaller quantities, only margaric acid (SFA 17:0) was associated
  with risk (HR = 1.36, 95% CI: 1.03–1.80, _P_ trend = 0.01) (data not shown).'
- 'Among TFAs, only dietary intake of TFA 18:2 (trans-octadecadienoic acid, also known
  as linolelaidic acid) was significantly associated with breast cancer risk (HR =
  1.53, 95% CI: 1.07–2.19, _P_ trend = 0.02).'
- 'We observed no association between total PUFA intake and breast cancer risk (Table
  2); however, dietary plus supplemental intake of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; PUFA
  20:5) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; PUFA 22:6) were inversely associated with breast
  cancer risk (Quintile 5 vs. Quintile 1: HR = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.54–0.90; and HR = 0.67,

- The short-chain ω-3 α-linolenic acid (PUFA 18:3) and ω-6 PUFAs linoleic acid (PUFA
  18:2) and arachidonic acid (PUFA 20:4) were not associated with breast cancer risk
  (Table 2).
- Finally, the ratio of long-chain ω-3 PUFA intake (EPA + DHA, from diet + supplement)
  to ω-6 PUFA intake (linoleic + arachidonic acid) was not associated with breast
  cancer risk.
- In this prospective study of postmenopausal women, we found associations between
  the intake of fatty acids within all 4 major categories of fats and breast cancer
  incidence.
- Specifically, intakes of total MUFA, the main contributors to SFA intake palmitic
  acid (SFA 16:0) and stearic acid (SFA 18:0), and the 18:2 trans fat, linolelaidic
  acid, were associated with increased risks of breast cancer.
- Dietary plus supplemental intakes of EPA (PUFA 20:5) and DHA (PUFA 22:6) were inversely
  associated with breast cancer risk.
- We also examined fatty acids consumed in only small amounts, which have not been
  examined in prior research.
- Among these, myristoleic (MUFA 14:1) and margaric (SFA 17:0) acids were associated
  with increased risks of breast cancer, whereas erucic acid (MUFA 22:1) was associated
  with decreased risk.

  fish intake areas or high supplement use) or when biomarkers of ω-3 PUFA are used.
- Dietary fat intake could affect the progression of breast cancer through several
  potential mechanisms (5454\.

- Higher fat intake is associated with adiposity, which can increase de novo estrogen
  synthesis leading to increased cell proliferation and breast cancer risk (5656\.

- However, our results were adjusted for BMI, to estimate the association of fat intake
  to breast cancer independent of body mass.
- It is also possible that a low-fat diet per se modifies blood hormone concentrations.
- Some randomized trials of a low-fat diet, including the large WHI dietary modification
  trial, reported reductions in estradiol and other hormones (5858\.

- However many low-fat interventions also included increased intake of fruits, vegetables,
  and/or fiber and most led to some weight loss, so the direct effect of fat intake
  on circulating hormones remains uncertain.
- An alternative hypothesis more related to types of fat consumed is that fatty acid
  intake could shift the balance of saturated to unsaturated fatty acids in the breast
  cell membrane, thereby altering the fluidity of the cell membrane.
- This in turn could alter the composition of proteins in the cell membrane or their
  behavior, perhaps by affecting a cell's response to growth factors or its ability
  to adhere to neighboring cells (6161\.

- In addition, it is well known that myristoylation or palmitoylation of specific
  proteins can cause them to be preferentially localized and anchored to the membrane.
- Thus, it is possible that increased dietary intake of specific fatty acids may be
  causing key changes in the localization and function of proteins important for tumor
  suppression.
- Dietary fats may also affect breast cancer risk by altering the membranes of the
  cells of the immune system (5555\.

  in blood concentrations of several inflammatory markers including C-reactive protein

- "author reply 444–445  \n\nThe strengths of this study are the relatively large
  size of the cohort, the prospective design that minimizes selection bias and differential
  measurement error, and the detailed FFQ, which was designed for more complete ascertainment
  of amounts and types of fat consumed over prior versions."
- In addition, we were able to ascertain fish oil supplement data to include in our
  assessment of intake of ω-3 PUFAs.
- One of the main limitations of this study is the measurement error due to self-reported
  food consumption.
- However, any error would be nondifferential in relation to disease status and would
  have led to attenuation of results.
- Another limitation in the interpretation of our results is that although we found
  associations between intake of several fatty acids and breast cancer risk, it is
  possible that other constituents of the foods high in the fatty acids of interest,
  including other fatty acids, could be responsible for the increased risk.
- Foods that are highest in total MUFAs per serving include fried chicken, beef/pork/ham/lamb
  eaten with the fat, peanut butter and nuts, fried fish, doughnuts/pies/pastries,
  regular (not low-fat) hot dogs and sausage, pizza, olive oil, and ground meat.
- MUFAs, as well as PUFAs, are inherently more sensitive to oxidation at high heat
  during frying because of their double bonds.
- Thus any harmful effect may be due to chemical alterations to MUFAs during cooking.
- 'This is supported by our analysis of the foods highest in MUFAs: Only fried chicken
  was associated with breast cancer risk (Supplemental Table).'
- It is possible that our findings reflect associations with other constituents of
  these foods.
- In addition, although the individual SFAs that were associated with breast cancer
  risk in this study are found in a large number of foods, they tend to occur together
  in the same foods, so one cannot separate their independent effects.
- However, it is unlikely that all SFAs have the same association with breast cancer
  risk because the 2 most abundant SFAs (palmitic and stearic acids) only accounted
  for about one-half of intake of total SFAs, and the other SFAs (except for margaric
  acid) were not associated with breast cancer risk.
- Another concern is residual confounding due to mismeasured or missing covariates
  in our analyses of fatty acids and foods.
- Also, our significant results only appeared after multivariate adjustment, primarily
  because of adjustment for energy intake.
- 'Adjustment for energy intake serves 2 purposes: 1) it “calibrates” intake based
  on the amount of energy consumed (which in turn would be correlated with body mass),
  which may be more biologically relevant than absolute intake, and 2) it corrects
  for 1 component of measurement error in a FFQ (i.e., the tendency of some people
  to overreport and others to underreport intake across most foods on a FFQ).'
- Thus the difference between the age-adjusted and fully adjusted results reflects
  these 2 types of corrections.
- In summary, in this cohort study of postmenopausal women, we found total MUFA intake
  and intake of specific MUFAs, SFAs, and TFAs to be associated with an increased
  risk of breast cancer, and long-chain ω-3 PUFAs associated with reduced risks of
  breast cancer.
- Although further study of specific fatty acids is needed, this study provides further
  support for the hypothesis that fat consumption is associated with breast cancer
  risk and suggests that risk varies by type of fatty acid.
