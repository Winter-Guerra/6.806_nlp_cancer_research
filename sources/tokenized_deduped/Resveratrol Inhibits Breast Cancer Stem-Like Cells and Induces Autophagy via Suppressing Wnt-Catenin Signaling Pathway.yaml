- Resveratrol, a natural polyphenolic compound, is abundantly found in plant foods
  and has been extensively studied for its anti-cancer properties.
- Given the important role of CSCs (Cancer Stem Cells) in breast tumorigenesis and
  progression, it is worth investigating the effects of resveratrol on CSCs.
- The article is an attempt to investigate the effects of resveratrol on breast CSCs.
- Resveratrol significantly inhibits the proliferation of BCSCs (breast cancer stem-like
  cells) isolated from MCF-7 and SUM159, and decreased the percentage of BCSCs population,
  consequently reduced the size and number of mammospheres in non-adherent spherical
  clusters.
- Accordingly, the injection of resveratrol (100 mg/kg/d) in NOD/SCID (nonobese diabetic/severe
  combined immunodeficient) mice effectively inhibited the growth of xenograft tumors
  and reduced BCSC population in tumor cells.
- After the reimplantation of primary tumor cells into the secondary mice for 30 d,
  all 6 control inoculations produced tumors, while tumor cells derived from resveratrol-treated
  mice only caused 1 tumor of 6 inoculations.
- Further studies by TEM (Transmission electron microscopy) analysis, GFP-LC3-II puncta
  formation assay and western blot for LC3-II, Beclin1 and Atg 7, showed that resveratrol
  induces autophagy in BCSCs.
- Moreover, resveratrol suppresses Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in BCSCs; over-expression
  of β-catenin by transfecting the plasmid markedly reduced resveratrol-induced cytotoxicity
  and autophagy in BCSCs.
- Our findings indicated that resveratrol inhibits BCSCs and induces autophagy via
  suppressing Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.

- Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women worldwide, with approximately
  70,000 new cases diagnosed each year.
- Despite advances in the detection and treatment of breast cancer, mortality from
  this disease remains high.
- The National Cancer Institute (NCI) has recognized that prevention is a critical
  component in minimizing the number of individuals that are afflicted with breast
  cancer [1], [2].
- The cancer stem cell hypothesis suggested that cancers be driven by a small subpopulation
  of stem cells.
- The CSCs possess such capacities as self-renewal and tumor generation [3].
- The concept of CSCs has profound clinical implications for cancer prevention and
  therapeutic strategies.
- With the identification of cancer-initiating cells and the assay of nonobese diabetic/severe
  combined immunodeficient (NOD/SCID) mouse xenotransplants, this hypothesis is well
  established [4].
- The initial discovery of breast CSCs revealed a cellular subpopulation from human
  breast cancer tumors characterized by the cell-surface markers ESA+/CD44+/CD24−/low
  [5], [6].
- This subpopulation of cells in tumors was highly tumorigenic [7].
- As few as 200 ESA+/CD44+/CD24−/low cells or 1000 CD44+/CD24−/low cells, could produce
  tumors when xenotransplanted into NOD/SCID mice.
- While more than 50,000 unsorted cells were required to generate tumors [8].
- Subsequent studies found that the aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity could also
  be used to enrich for breast CSCs and normal mammary stem cells [9], [10].
- The convenient isolation of CSCs has allowed the investigation of the molecular
  mechanisms involved in their origin, self-renewal, differentiation into cancer cells,
  resistance to radiation therapy and chemotherapy, and invasiveness and metastatic
  ability [11].
- Clinical analyses of CSCs in breast tumors have found a correlation between the
  proportion of CSCs and poor prognosis [12].
- Therefore, chemoprevention and therapy strategies that specifically target CSCs
  are an urgent need [13].
- Because a diet rich in plant foods reduced the risks of cancer, there were more
  and more interest in isolating and characterizing the nutritive and non-nutritive
  components in fruits and vegetables for potential chemo-preventive agents [14],
  [15], [16].
- Resveratrol (3,4′,5-trihydroxy-trans-stilbene) is a polyphenol compound which is
  abundantly found in plant foods including grapes, red wine, berries, and peanuts.
- Studies revealed a wide spectrum of pharmacological bioactivities of resveratrol,
  such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor and anti-atherosclerotic properties
  [17], [18], [19].
- The anti-cancer effect of resveratrol has been shown to modulate various steps of
  carcinogenesis and development such as initiation, progression, and metastasis [20],
  [21].
- However, the underlying molecular mechanism of anti-cancer effect has not been clearly
  defined.
- Given the important role of CSCs in breast tumorigenesis and development, it is
  worth investigating the effects of resveratrol on breast CSCs and exploring the
  potential mechanisms.
- The purpose of this work was to develop an understanding of the effects of resveratrol
  on breast CSCs to determine its therapeutic value in preventing or treating this
  disease.

  instructions.
- Briefly, cells were seeded in a 96-well microplate at a density of 5×104/ml.
- After 24h, cells were treated with resveratrol.
- Subsequently, CCK-8 solution (20 µl/well) was added and the plate was incubated

  ALDH substrate, bodipy-aminoacetaldehyde (1 µM per 1×106 cells), for 40 to 50 minutes
  at 37°C.
- As a negative control, a fraction of cells from each sample was incubated under
  identical condition in the presence of the ALDH inhibitor diethylaminobenzaldehyde.
- Flow cytometry was used to measure and isolate the ALDH-positive cell population.
- NOD/SCID mice were obtained from the Medical Experimental Animal Center of the Third
  Military Medical University [SCXK-(army)-2007-015].
- They were bred and maintained in accordance with our institutional guidelines for
  the use of laboratory animals.
- Animal rooms were maintained at 25°C with 50% relative humidity and a 12-h light/12-h
  dark cycle.
- All animal procedures were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of the Third
  Military Medical University.
- SUM159 cells (5×106) mixed with Matrigel(BD Biosciences) were injected to the mammary
  fat pads of 5-week-old female NOD/SCID mice.
- Tumors were measured with a caliper and the volume was calculated using V = (width2
  × length)/2.
- 'Two weeks after the cell injection, mice were randomly separated into two groups:
  one group was injected (i.v.)'
- with control (0.9% NaCl solution) and the other group was injected with 100 mg/kg
  resveratrol (dissolved in 0.9% NaCl solution) daily for 2 weeks.
- Mice were humanely euthanized and tumors were harvested.
- Tumor tissues were dissociated mechanically and enzymatically to obtain a single-cell
  suspension.
- Briefly, tumors were minced by scalpel and incubated in medium 199 mixed with collagenase/hyaluronidase
  at 37°C for 15 to 20 minutes.
- The tissues were further dissociated by pipette trituration and then passed through
  a 40- µm nylon mesh to produce a single-cell suspension.
- Living cells from the dissociated tumors were sorted out by fluorescence-activated
  cell sorting.
- Mice were implanted with tumor cells separately.
- Each secondary NOD/SCID mouse was inoculated with 5×104 cells from control mouse
  tumors in one side of inguinal mammary fat pad and another 5×104 cells from resveratrol-treated
  tumors in the contralateral mammary fat pad.
- Cells were collected and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% glutaraldehyde in
  0.1 M sodium cacodylate for 2 h, post-fixed with 1% OsO4 for 1.5 h, washed, and
  stained for 1 h in 3% aqueous uranyl acetate.
- The samples were then washed again, dehydrated with graded alcohol, and embedded
  in Epon-Araldite resin (Canemco &amp; Marivac, Lakefield, Quebec, Canada).
- Ultrathin sections were cut on an ultramicrotome (Reichert-Jung, Inc., Cambridge,
  UK), counterstained with 0.3% lead citrate, and examined on a transmission electron
  microscope (EM420; Koninklijke Philips Electronics N.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands).
- Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 in Opti-Mem, according to the manufacturer's
  protocol.
- The medium was replaced 8 h later and cells were collected for the next experiments
  48 h post-transfection.
- Cells were transfected with a plasmid expressing GFP- LC3-II using Lipofectamine
  2000 for 24 h and then incubated for 6 h at 37°C.
- Following fixation, cells were immediately visualized by confocal microscopy.
- The number of GFP-LC3-II -positive puncta in each cell was counted.
- A cell including more than 20 puncta dots is considered to an autophagic cell.
- At least 100 cells were analysed per sample.
- Briefly, 30~50 µg of protein were resolved by 15% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide
  gel electrophoresis and then electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes
  for western blot analysis.
- Blots were probed with 1:1,000-diluted primary antibodies overnight at 4°C, followed
  by the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies.
- Then, the proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence exposure to X-ray
  film.
- Finally, the blots were scanned, and densitometric analysis was performed on the
  scanning images using Scion Image-Release Beta 4.02 software.
- Quantitative data are presented as means ± standard deviation (SD) of three experiments.
- The statistical analysis was conducted with the t-test and one-way analysis of variance
  using SPSS 13.0 statistical software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
- A p-value &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant.
- We first evaluated the cytotoxic effects of resveratrol on breast epithelial cells
  MCF10A and breast cancer cells SUM159, MCF-7.
- Results (Fig 1A) indicated that resveratrol significantly decreased the cells viability
  of SUM159 and MCF-7, while showed no apparent cytotoxicity on MCF10A cells.
- (A) The cytotoxic effects of resveratrol treatment (0, 10, 20 and 40 µM) for 24
  h on breast epithelial cells MCF10A and breast cancer cells SUM159, MCF-7, detected
  by CCK-8 assay.
- (B) The cytotoxic effects of resveratrol treatment for 24 h on BCSCs isolated from
  SUM159 and MCF-7 cells.
- (C) Treatment with resveratrol for 24 h significantly decreased the percentage of
  ALDH-positive population in SUM159 cells.
- The changing situations in MCF-7 were alike.
- (D) The effect of resveratrol treatment for 7 days on the formation of mammospheres
  in BCSCs.
- Data are presented as mean ± SD (_n_ = 3).
- _P_&lt;0.05, _P_&lt;0.01 compared with the control (0 µM).
- Then, we evaluated the inhibitory effects of resveratrol on BCSCs.
- As shown in Fig 1C, resveratrol treatment significantly decreased the percentage
  of ALDH-positive population in SUM159 cells, suggesting that resveratrol effectively
  reduced breast CSCs population _in vitro_.
- Next, cells viability assay (Fig 1B) showed that resveratrol treatment significantly
  inhibits BCSCs proliferation.
- Furthermore, we observed the effect of resveratrol on the formation of mammospheres
  in BCSCs, because mammary stem/progenitor cells are enriched in non-adherent spherical
  clusters.
- Results (Fig 1D) indicated that in cells treated with resveratrol compared with
  the control, the number of spheres declined and the size of the spheres was reduced.
- Taken together, these findings demonstrated that resveratrol inhibits breast CSCs
  _in vitro_.
- We evaluated the inhibitory effect of resveratrol targeting breast CSCs _in vivo_,
  using a xenograft model of SUM159 cells in NOD/SCID mice.
- After cell inoculation for 2 weeks, the mice were injected with resveratrol (100
  mg/kg/d) or saline for another 2 weeks.
- In two weeks of treatment, resveratrol displayed no apparent toxicity as determined
  by body weight; yet the tumor volume in resveratrol-treated mice was significantly
  smaller than that in the control (Fig 2A), indicating that resveratrol could effectively
  inhibit the growth of breast cancer cells _in vivo_.
- (A) Resveratrol injection (100 mg/kg/d, i.v.)
- effectively inhibits the growth of xenografted tumors of SUM159 cells in NOD/SCID
  mice.
- (B) Resveratrol administration significantly reduced the ALDH-positive populations
  in tumor cells dissociated from xenograft in NOD/SCID mice.
- Data are presented as mean ± SD (_n_ = 6).
- _P_&lt;0.05, _P_&lt;0.01 compared with the control.
- Then, the tumors were isolated from mice and the tumor cells were analyzed.
- The analysis revealed that resveratrol significantly reduced the ALDH-positive populations
  in tumor cells compared with those in the control mice (Fig 2B).
- Furthermore, we examined the ability of residual cancer cells to initiate tumors
  in NOD/SCID mice inoculated with primary tumor cells obtained from the primary xenografts.
- After inoculation for 30 d, all 6 control inoculations produced tumors, while tumor
  cells derived from resveratrol-treated mice only caused 1 tumor of 6 inoculations.
- These findings indicated that resveratrol could eliminate breast CSCs in primary
  xenografts, and consequently abrogate the regrowth of tumors in secondary mice.
- We tested the effects of resveratrol on autophagy in breast CSCs.
- First, by TEM analysis, we determined that resveratrol treatment increased the number
  of autophagosomes in BCSCs from SUM159 and MCF-7 (Fig 3A).
- Then we performed western blot analysis because LC3-II, Beclin1 and Atg 7 are indicators
  of autophagy and they are required for autophagosome formation.
- As shown in Fig 3B, LC3-II, Beclin1 and Atg 7 were significantly up-regulated by
  resveratrol in breast CSCs in a dose-dependent manner.
- Furthermore, GFP-LC3-II puncta formation assay confirmed that resveratrol-treated
  breast CSCs displayed a significant increase in the percentage of cells with autophagosomes
  (GFP-LC3-II dots) compared with the control (Fig 3C).
- In all, these findings indicated that resveratrol induces autophagy in breast CSCs.
- (A) Resveratrol treatment (40 µM) for 24 h increased the number of autophagosomes
  in BCSCs from SUM159 and MCF-7, determined by TEM analysis.
- (B) Western blotting detection of LC3-II, Beclin1 and Atg 7 in BCSCs treated with
  different dose of resveratrol for 24 h. (C) GFP-LC3-II puncta formation assay in
  BCSCs treated with resveratrol for 24 h. Data are presented as mean ± SD (_n_ =
  3).
- _P_&lt;0.05, _P_&lt;0.01 compared with the control (0 µM).
- The Wnt/β-catenin pathway is an important regulator of stem cell self-renewal, proliferation
  as well as autophagy.
- We then studied the effects of resveratrol on Wnt/β-catenin pathway in BCSCs to
  explore the potential anticancer mechanisms.
- Western blotting detections showed that resveratrol treatment decreased the expression
  of β-catenin and cyclin D1 in breast CSCs _in vitro_ (Fig 4A).
- Accordingly, the immunohistochemistry detection indicated that resveratrol administration
  could significantly reduce the expression of β-catenin and cyclin D1 in xenograft
  breast tumors _in vivo_ (Fig 4B).
- Figure 4.
- Inhibition of autophagy or over-expression of β-catenin attenuates the effects of
  resveratrol on BCSCs.
- (A) Western blot analysis of β-catenin and cyclin D1 in BCSCs treated with different
  dose of resveratrol for 24 h. (B) Immunohistochemistry detection of β-catenin and

- '_P_&lt;0.05, _P_&lt;0.01 compared with the control (0 µM); #_P_&lt;0.05, ##_P_&lt;0.01
  compared with corresponding group in CSCs.'
- We investigated the effects of autophagy inhibitor CQ on resveratrol-induced reduction
  of BCSCs population in SUM159 cells.
- As shown in Fig 4C, CQ co-treatment significantly compromises resveratrol-induced
  reduction of ALDH-positive populations in breast cancer cells.
- Then further study indicated that CQ co-treatment blocked autophagic induction of
  resveratrol in BCSCs, and simultaneously attenuated the anti-proliferation effect
  of resveratrol on BCSCs (Fig 4D and E).
- These data addressed the important role of autophagy in the anticancer mechanism
  of resveratrol on BCSCs.
- To explore the role of Wnt/β-catenin pathway in the anti-proliferation and pro-autophagy
  effects of resveratrol, we transfected plasmid of pcDNA3-S33Y β-catenin.
- Transient transfection of the plasmid led to substantial production of β-catenin
  in BCSCs and abrogated the inhibitory effect of resveratrol on Wnt/β-catenin signal
  (Fig 4F).
- In transfected cells, over-expressed β-catenin markedly reduced resveratrol-induced
  cytotoxicity and autophagy, indicating that resveratrol inhibits breast CSCs and
  induces autophagy, at least partially, via suppressing Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.
- Resveratrol is a phytoalexin that protects plants against pathogens.
- Specific anticancer effects of resveratrol have also been shown [22], [23], [24].
- The most persuasive evidence indicates that resveratrol affects the early steps
  in the process of carcinogenesis [25].
- The chemo-preventive as well as chemo-therapeutic effect of resveratrol against
  various types of cancers in pre-clinical testing has been well documented [14].
- However, underlining molecular mechanism of its anti-cancer activity is yet to be
  defined.
- Increasing evidences support the CSC theory and demonstrate that CSCs have the capacity
  to drive tumor initiation, resistance and relapse/recurrence.
- Current chemopreventions and chemotherapies are not efficacious in the treatment
  of advanced and metastatic disease, so novel approaches are required to specifically
  target CSC populations.
- Thus, therapies that are directed against both differentiated cancer cells and CSCs
  may improve the treatment of these diseases.
- Studies have found that several dietary compounds, including curcumin and sulforaphane,
  are promising chemo-preventive agents against CSCs [26], [27].
- Therefore, based on the chemo-preventive activity of resveratrol and the implications
  of the CSC theory [28], we used both _in vitro_ and _in vivo_ systems to determine
  whether resveratrol acts against breast CSCs.
- Our findings showed that resveratrol could significantly inhibit breast CSCs _in
  vitro_ and _in vivo_, effectively reducing breast CSCs population, inhibiting the
  proliferation and the formation of mammospheres in breast CSCs.
- Nevertheless, it should be noted that the dose of resveratrol treatment in cellular
  experiments may be far higher than that in _in vivo_ study; so more studies are
  warranted to confirm the results.
- Furthermore, we examined the ability of residual cancer cells to initiate tumors
  in NOD/SCID mice inoculated with primary tumor cells obtained from the primary xenografts.
- Results indicated that resveratrol administration eliminated breast CSCs in primary
  xenografts, and consequently abrogate the regrowth of tumors in secondary mice.
- Autophagy is a catabolic process involving physiological turnover of long-lived
  proteins and damaged organelles in autophagosome [29].
- Proper autophagy is an important response to the extrinsic and intrinsic cellular
  environments, and positively regulates cellular processes for survival.
- However, excessive autophagy will result in autophagic cell death [30], [31].
- Autophagy is emerging as new target for cancer therapy and chemoprevention, yet
  the role of autophagy in cancer is complex, because whether autophagy causes survival
  or death in cancer cells is complicated and depends on specific context [32], [33].
- Previous studies indicated that treatment of ovarian cancer cells and glioma cells
  with resveratrol and curcumin, respectively, induced autophagic cell death [34],
  [35].
- The effect of resveratrol on autophagy in breast CSCs is unclear.
- Our study showed that resveratrol induces autophagy in breast CSCs, which may play
  an important role in the anticancer mechanism.
- Previous study indicated that autophagy positively regulates the CD44+CD24-/low
  breast cancer stem-like phenotype [7]; however in the present study our data showed
  that resveratrol-induced autophagy plays a negative mechanism for BCSCs maintenance.
- The different observations may be attributed to that resveratrol induces excessive
  autophagy to cause autophagic cell death in BCSCs.
- More careful studies are needed to confirm the hypothesis.
- CSCs have the ability to self-renew and a potential to differentiate, generating
  cells with a variety of phenotypes within tumors.
- Three signaling pathways play crucial role in the regulation of breast CSCs self-renewal,
  including Wnt, Notch and Hedgehog [36].
- The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway maintains normal intestinal homeostasis and
  is aberrantly activated in many cancers, especially in breast cancer.
- β-Catenin is an essential transcriptional co-regulator in the canonical Wnt signaling
  pathway, forming complexes with the TCF/LEF (T cell-specific transcription factor/lymphoid
  enhancer-binding factor 1) family of transcription factors to control target gene
  expression.
- Recent study revealed that Wnt/β-catenin signal path also acts as a negative regulator
  of both basal and stress-induced autophagy [37], [38], [39].
- Our study found that resveratrol suppresses Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in breast
  CSCs _in vitro_ and _in vivo_.
- Furthermore, we explored the role of Wnt/β-catenin pathway in the anti-proliferation
  and pro-autophagy effects of resveratrol, results showed that over expression of
  β-catenin reduced autophagy rate and compromised the effects of resveratrol, indicating
  that resveratrol inhibits breast CSCs and induces autophagy, at least partially,
  via suppressing Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.
