- Breast carcinoma is one of the most common neoplasia and the first cause of women
  cancer related deaths worldwide.
- In the past few years with diagnostic increment, the number of patients diagnosed
  with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) increased considerably and opened up new ways
  in research and new dilemmas in diagnostic and clinical practice.
- This work aimed to evaluate differences in Galectin-1 and Galectin-3 expression
  and lectins ligands profile on DCIS cells in hypoxic microenvironment.
- Lectin histochemistry and immunohistochemistry were performed with Concanavalin
  A, Wheat Germ Agglutinin, Peanut Agglutinin and _Ulex_ _europaeus_ Agglutinin lectins
  and with anti-Galectin-1 and anti-Galectin-3 antibodies.
- Lectin ligands were more recognized in hypoxic lesions by Concanavalin A (_p_ =
  0.0019), Wheat Germ Agglutinin (_p_ &lt; 0.001) and _Ulex_ _europaeus_ Agglutinin
  (_p_ = 0.0014), but not by Peanut Agglutinin (_p_ = 0.5779) when compared to non-hypoxic.
- Galectin-1 was not observed in all cases analyzed on both groups, differing from
  Galectin-3 that was overexpressed on cytoplasm of DCIS hypoxic group in relation
  to control group (_p_ = 0.031).
- As far as we are concerned, this is the first paper that describes glycobiological
  alterations in breast cancer hypoxic environment in vivo that could be used to validate
  in vitro models on this aspect.
- Moreover, comedogenic/necrotic carcinomas were usually associated with poor-prognostic
  than others, and our results show that glycosylation may play an important role
  in this event.
- Breast carcinoma is one of the most common neoplasias and the first cause of women
  cancer related deaths worldwide [1].
- In the past few years with diagnostic increment, the number of patients diagnosed
  with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) increased considerably and opened up new ways
  in research and new dilemmas in diagnostic and clinical practice [2].
- Ducts in DCIS are markedly enlarged in the range of 360 μm in diameter, but since
  the diffusion of oxygen from peri-ductal vessels is limited to 100–180 μm, cells
  in the center of DCIS are poorly oxygenated and become either necrotic or remain
  hypoxic but viable [3, 4].
- Because of this, DCIS represents a great injury to study hypoxia events so that
  Bussolati and coworkers [4] proposed a new DCIS classification system based on their
  necrotic and hypoxia areas.
- This classification was shown highly reproducible in many different European cancer
  centers.
- The hypoxic response via hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) is recognized as one of
  the most important microenvironmental modulator, altering tumor behavior and influencing
  all tumors hallmarks, enabling tumors cells to acquire an aggressive phenotype and
  become resistant to chemotherapy and radiotherapy [5, 6].
- Hypoxia switches not only energetic metabolism to anaerobic pathway but also changes
  glucose destination, synthesis of sugar nucleotide transporters, and glycosyltransferase
  activity [7].
- These alterations in glycan cycle alters glycosylation pattern of tumor cells, changing
  the neoplastic cells behavior [8].
- Such glycosylation changes might be recognized by endogenous galectins [9], modulators
  of biological events, and by exogenous lectins capable of correlating these events
  with information concerning prognosis, diagnosis, and therapy response [10].
- In this sense, ConA—Concanavalin A, UEA-I—_Ulex_ _europaeus_ Agglutinin, WGA—Wheat
  Germ Agglutinin, and PNA—Peanut Agglutinin lectins receive highlights in the literature,
  since their ligands, glucose/mannose, l-fucose, sialic acid/_N_-acetyl-glucosamine,
  and d-galactose, respectively, present different expression profiles in cells under
  carcinogenic process.
- Some studies have shown that other glycobiological aspects are changed in tumor
  hypoxia such as Galectin-3 (Gal-3) overexpression in melanoma cells on hypoxic environment
  [11] and Galectin-1 (Gal-1) that represents a link between tumor immune privilege
  and hypoxia in Squamous-cells carcinoma [12].
- In this context, this work aimed to evaluate differences in Gal-1 and Gal-3 expression
  and ConA, WGA, UEA-I, and PNA ligands’ profile in hypoxic and non-hypoxic DCIS lesions.
- This retrospective study was performed with archival tissue biopsies from patients
  diagnosed with breast DCIS (_n_ = 66), between years 2002 and 2009, obtained at
  the University Hospital of Federal University of Pernambuco after approval by Health
  Sciences Centre Ethics Board.
- Clinical and pathological data from patients were obtained from medical file at
  Medical Assistance and Statistic Service of this institution.
- Lesions were considered hypoxic if presenting necrotic nuclei or more than 360 μm
  diameter [4] and small lesions without necrotic areas was considered non-hypoxic.
- Considering that one biopsy frequently presents more than one lesion, the media
  of lesions analyzed were 80.
- Four-micrometer-thick sections of specimens were deparaffinized in xylene and dehydrated
  in graded alcohol (100–70 %).
- Slices were treated with 0.1 % (w/v) trypsin solution for 2 min at 37 °C followed
  by a 0.3 % (v/v) methanol-H2O2 solution for 30 min at 25 °C and then incubated separately
  with 80 μg/mL of Con A, PNA, WGA, and UEA-I lectins conjugated to horseradish peroxidase
  (Sigma, USA) for 2 h at 4 °C.
- All solutions and washings were carried out using a 10 mM phosphate buffer solution
  pH 7.2 containing 150 mM NaCl.
- Lectin binding inhibition assays were developed incubating the lectin with its corresponding
  specific sugars, sialic acid/_N_-acetyl-glucosamine for WGA, methyl-α-d-mannoside
  for Con A, l-fucose for UEA-I and d-galactose for PNA (20–500 mM) prior to tissue
  incubation.
- Negative controls were performed replacing the lectin for PBS and positive controls
  with tissues previously known as positive for these lectins.
- Four-micrometer-thick sections of specimens, after xylene deparaffinization and
  graded alcohol hydration (100–70 %), were incubated in methanol-H2O2 solution (1:1,
  v/v) and with 10 % (w/v) non-fat milk solution.
- Antigenic sites were thermally recovered in steamer with 10 mM citrate buffer pH
  6.0.
- Primary antibodies (anti-Gal-3 and anti-Gal-1, both at 1:150) were incubated for
  2 h at 25 °C, and immune detected with biotin-free polymer (DAKO, USA) was reveled
  with diaminobenzidine (DAB) and counterstained with Mayer’s haematoxylene.
- Negative controls were obtained replacing the primary antibody by non-immune serum,
  and positive controls were performed according to antibody manufacturer (Santa Cruz
  Biotecnology, USA).
- All statistical analyzes were performed in GraphPad Prism version 4.0.
- Non-parametric data were evaluated by the Chi-square (χ2).
- Differences were considered statistically significant at _p_ &lt; 0.05.
- All experiments were repeated at least three times to results consideration.
- Con A ligands (d-mannose/d-glucose) were more recognized in hypoxic group than non-hypoxic
  (_p_ = 0.0019).
- Forty out 44 hypoxic lesions were stained by ConA (Fig.
- 1a), and in non-hypoxic group this lectin was positive only in 25 lesions and negative
  in 15.
- The subcellular location of lectin staining was cytoplasmatic only or cytoplasmatic
  plus membrane in both groups.
- WGA recognized its ligands in 41 lesions of hypoxic group (Fig.
- 1b) and did not in three samples.
- On the other hand, the non-hypoxic group was positive only in 19 cases and negative
  in 21 lesions, revealing a higher recognition of its ligands in the hypoxic group
  (_p_ &lt; 0.001).
- It was observed a difference in WGA cellular staining pattern; in hypoxic lesions
  this staining was mainly cytoplasmatic, differing from non-hypoxic group that shows
  membrane staining too (Fig.
- 1c).
- Lectins staining pattern in hypoxic breast DCIS.
- a ConA cytoplasmatic, 100×.
- b WGA cytoplasmatic, 100×.
- c WGA membrane staining in non-hypoxic lesion, 400× d UEA-I, 100×, staining hypoxic
  DCIS but not no-hypoxic below (_arrow_).
- e PNA staining in perinecrotic cell of hypoxic DCIS, 100×.
- 'f. Gal-3 expression in hypoxic group, _arrow_ indicates absence of staining in
  a no-hypoxic lesion area


  UEA-I recognized l-fucose residues mainly in hypoxic group (22 of 40 sample) (Fig.'
- 1d), while in non-hypoxic group only 6 of 40 lesions were positive (_p_ = 0.0014).
- PNA did not recognize differentially the two groups being positive in 21 lesions
  in hypoxic group (Fig.
- 1e) and 18 in non-hypoxic group (_p_ = 0.5779).
- PNA and UEA-I staining pattern was cytoplasmatic, predominantly, in both groups.
- It was also observed that PNA negative lesions were all positive for WGA in hypoxic
  group, and this was not observed in non-hypoxic.
- After neuraminidase treatment, PNA negative samples of hypoxic group became positive
  in 60 % of them.
- Lectin histochemistry results were summarized on Fig.
- 2
- Gal-1 expression was not detected in neoplastic cells of all cases analyzed on both
  groups, but tumor associated stromal cells were recognized by anti-gal-1(data not
  shown).
- Trying to draw a difference between the groups hypoxic and non-hypoxic positive
  stromal cells were counted in six different random fields in the 40× objective,
  but no difference was found.
- On the other hand, Gal-3 was overexpressed (Fig.
- 1f) on cytoplasm of DCIS hypoxic group in relation to non-hypoxic (_p_ &lt; 0.031).
- Quantitative and qualitative changes in cell glycoconjugates are highly significant
  in the development and progression of many neoplastic processes [13].
- In tumor cells, the content, accessibility, and/or expression of surface carbohydrates
  have been evaluated by lectin histochemistry[14].
- These processes are affected, directly or indirectly, by _N_\- and/or _O_-glycosylation
  of functional proteins or lipids [15].
- The characterization of this glycocode is, therefore, indispensable for the understanding
  of many biological processes [16].
- A few years ago, the role of hypoxia in glycan cycle started to be elucidated showing
  a different pattern of glycosylation [9].
- Our results reveal an overexpression of Con A ligands in DCIS hypoxic group (_p_
  = 0.0019).
- One hypothesis for this increase is the gain of mannose rich structures in some
  proteins selectively expressed in hypoxic environment such as carbonic anhydrase
  [17].
- In our results, we observed a positive relation between UEA-I ligands in DCIS and
  hypoxic areas in these lesions (_p_ = 0.0014), and this could be related to the
  increased expression of difucosylated Lewis antigens by fucosyltransferase VII increased
  expression [18].
- Our results also showed that negative lesions to PNA were positive to WGA, since
  galactose (recognized by PNA) is usually a terminal residue which is frequently
  sialylated on cancer being hidden by this later sugar [19].
- This result was confirmed when negative sample became positive after neuraminidase
  treatment.
- These data are in agreement with Yin et al.
- '[20] that showed an increased expression of sialic acid transporters accompanied
  with an enhanced incorporation of _N_-glycolylneuraminic acid as well as _N_-acetyl
  sialic acid in colon cancer cells under hypoxic conditions.'
- In hypoxic group, WGA staining was more cytoplasmic and less membrane related; this
  change on sub-cell ligands expression provides important information, since membrane
  staining is usually more associated with _N_-glycosylation and cytoplasmic with
  _O_-glycosylation [21] suggesting a saccharide pattern change in this group of neoplastic
  cells.
- Knowing that Gal-1 is not commonly expressed in neoplastic cells of breast cancer
  [22], we hypothesized that this protein could be required by these cells or overexpressed
  in stromal cells in hypoxia environment.
- Our hypotheses were not validated by our experiments.
- Differently, Le et al.
- '[12] observed Gal-1 positivity in samples of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma
  which was correlated to the immune privilege struck by the absence of CD3 antigen
  on stromal cells coupled with its on overexpression in neoplastic cells.'
- We could not form such correlation since none of DCIS lesion was positive to Gal-1.
- We also try to observe an increase in stromal cells expression of Gal-1 on hypoxic
  microenvironment; however, this association also did not proved true.
- Gal-3 was overexpressed on hypoxic group like that observed on melanoma cell in
  a vitro hypoxic model.
- As Galectin-3 is frequently involved with protection against cell death [23], this
  molecule may play an important role in cancer survival and resistance to many therapy
  approaches on hypoxia microenvironment.
- In this sense, inhibition of Gal-3 represents a promising strategy to sensitize
  these cells to death.
- Our study shows that Gal-3 and ConA, UEA-I, and WGA ligands are overexpressed in
  hypoxic environment, and Gal-1 and PNA ligands are not.
- As far as we are concerned, this is the first paper to describe glycobiological
  alterations in breast cancer hypoxic environment in vivo that could be used to validate
  in vitro models that tries to modulate Gal-3 and others glycobiological aspects
  of breast cancer.
- Moreover, open new ways to use this data to correlate with patient prognostic, since
  comedogenic carcinomas, usually hypoxic because of central necrosis, were associated
  with poor-prognostic than others.
