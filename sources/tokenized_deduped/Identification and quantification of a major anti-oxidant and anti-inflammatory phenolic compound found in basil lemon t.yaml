- Major phenolic compounds from basil, lemon thyme, mint, oregano, rosemary, sage,
  and thyme were investigated using a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)
  profiling technique in combination with DPPH-radical scavenging, xanthine oxidase
  and cyclooxygenase assays.
- For the present study, 15 plant-derived phenolic compounds (gallic, protocatechuic,
  vanillic, syringic, chlorogenic, rosmarinic, caffeic, ferulic, and sinapic acids,
  protocatechualdehyde, vanillin, N-coumaroyltyramine, N-caffeoyltyramine, N-feruloyltyramine,
  and N-sinapoyltyramine) were selected and their DPPH-radical scavenging activities
  were first determined.
- Then, a standard HPLC profiling of these phenolics was constructed using an HPLC
  method to isolate anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory phenolic compounds from MeOH
  extracts of the plants.
- Rosmarinic acid was identified as a major anti-oxidant compound (0.22-0.97%) in
  all seven herbs, confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance.
- Rosmarinic acid from the plants quenched superoxide radicals from xanthine oxidase
  and inhibited cyclooxygenase I and II enzymes.
- In this study, the rosmarinic acid content of perilla was also determined and compared
  with those of the seven herbs.
