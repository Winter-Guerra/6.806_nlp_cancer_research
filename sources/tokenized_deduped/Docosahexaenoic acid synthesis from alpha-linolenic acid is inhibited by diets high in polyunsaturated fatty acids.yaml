- The conversion of the plant-derived omega-3 (n-3) Î±-linolenic acid (ALA, 18:3n-3)
  to the long-chain eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid
  (DHA, 22:6n-3) can be increased by ALA sufficient diets compared to ALA deficient
  diets.
- Diets containing ALA above an optimal level result in no further increase in DHA
  levels in animals and humans.
- The present study evaluates means of maximizing plasma DHA accumulation by systematically
  varying both linoleic acid (LA, 18:2n-6) and ALA dietary level.
- Weanling rats were fed one of 54 diets for three weeks.
- The diets varied in the percentage of energy (en%) of LA (0.07-17.1 en%) and ALA
  (0.02-12.1 en%) by manipulating both the fat content and the balance of vegetable
  oils.
- The peak of plasma phospholipid DHA (&gt;8% total fatty acids) was attained as a
  result of feeding a narrow dietary range of 1-3 en% ALA and 1-2 en% LA but was suppressed
  to basal levels (∼2% total fatty acids) at dietary intakes of total polyunsaturated
  fatty acids (PUFA) above 3 en%.
- We conclude it is possible to enhance the DHA status of rats fed diets containing
  ALA as the only source of n-3 fatty acids but only when the level of dietary PUFA
  is low (&lt;3 en%).
