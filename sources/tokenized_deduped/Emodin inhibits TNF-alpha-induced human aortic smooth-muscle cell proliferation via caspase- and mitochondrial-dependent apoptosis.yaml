- Vascular smooth-muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation plays a vital role in hypertension,
  atherosclerosis and restenosis.
- It has been reported that emodin, an active component extracted from rhubarb, can
  stop the growth of cancer cells; however, it is not known if emodin exerts similar
  anti-atherogenic effects in TNF-α treated human aortic smooth-muscle cells (HASMC).
- In this study, emodin treatment showed potent inhibitory effects in TNF-α-induced
  HASMC proliferation that were associated with induced apoptosis, including the cleavage
  of poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP).
- Moreover, inhibitors of caspase-3, -8 and -9 (Ac-DEVD-CHO, Z-IETD-FMK and Z-LEHD-FMK)
  efficiently blocked emodin-induced apoptosis in TNF-α treated HASMC.
- Therefore, emodin-induced cell death occurred via caspase-dependent apoptosis.
- Emodin treatment resulted in the release of cytochrome _c_ into cytosol and a loss
  of mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), as well as a decrease in the expression
  of an anti-apoptotic protein (Bcl-2) and an increase in the expression of an a pro-apoptotic
  protein (Bax).
- Emodin-mediated apoptosis was also blocked by a mitochondrial membrane depolarization
  inhibitor, which indicates that emodin-induced apoptosis occurred via a mitochondrial
  pathway.
- Taken together, the results of this study showed that emodin inhibits TNF-α-induced
  HASMC proliferation via caspase- and a mitochondrial-dependent apoptotic pathway.
- In addition, these results indicate that emodin has potential as an anti-atherosclerosis
  agent.
