- The present study assayed the antimutagenic potential of _Salvia officinalis_ (sage)
  in the form of tea infusion, by the somatic mutation and recombination test (SMART)
  on _Drosophila melanogaster_.
- The use of herbal infusions is much common in the human diet, so the aim of the
  present study was to estimate the antimutagenic effects of the _S.
- officinalis_ tea rather than essential oils.
- Methyl methanesulphonate (MMS) was used as the mutagen and positive control.
- 'Several types of treatment were performed: short acute treatment with sage infusion
  or MMS, longer (chronic) treatment with sage solution or MMS, and two combined treatments,
  i.e.'
- short treatment with sage followed by a longer treatment with MMS and _vice versa_.
- Sage infusion used in our experiments showed a clear antimutagenic effect, reducing
  the frequency of mutations induced by MMS.
- The inhibition effect of sage tea is obtained and confirmed when pre- or post-treatments
  with mutagen were used.
- The results indicate that although sage in this regime decreases the number of mutation
  events, it is not efficient enough in case of the 2 h sage pre-treatment.
- Antioxidant activity, suppression of metabolic activation, could be mechanisms through
  which sage or some of its components act as desmutagen.
