- Four new meroterpenoids, terreumols A–D (1–4), with a rare 10-membered ring system,
  were isolated from the fruiting bodies of _Tricholoma terreum_.
- Their structures with absolute stereochemistry were determined by comprehensive
  spectroscopic methods, as well as single-crystal X-ray diffractions.
- Compounds 1, 3, and 4 were evaluated for their cytotoxicities against five human
  cancer cell lines; all of them exhibited inhibitory effects, with IC50 values comparable
  to those of cisplatin.
- Meroterpenoids are broadly defined as compounds of mixed biosynthetic origin (polyketide-terpenoid)
  containing either a phenolic, a quinine, or a closely related subunit linked to
  a terpenoid moiety by at least one C–C bond,(1) which have been found in plants,
  marine organisms, and higher fungi.
- More significantly, the family has the reputation for displaying potent biological
  activities, and members have been reported to be anti-inflammatory,(2) antimalarial,(2a)
  antioxidants,(2b, 3) antitumor,(2d, 4) antibacterials,(1e, 4c, 5) and _ras_ farnesyl-protein
  transferase inhibitors(6) and to show severe ichthyotoxic effects.
- (7) Besides their interesting pharmacological properties, they have complicated
  biosynthetic origins and arouse interest from synthetic chemists.

  The wild mushroom _Tricholoma equestre_ (or _T.'
- flavovirens_) has caused poisoning in southwestern France.
- Twelve people were hospitalized for severe weakness and muscle loss after eating
  the mushrooms, and three of them died.
- (9) Despite the highly toxic nature of _T.
- equestre_, the poison in this mushroom has not been characterized.
- This inspired us to investigate the toxic constituents of _T.
- equestre_ and related species.
- When we collected _T.
- equestre_, the mushroom _Tricholoma terreum_, another species of the same genus,
  was harvested from the same environment.
- Since _T.
- equestre_ could be mistaken for other members of the _Tricholoma_ genus or similar
  myotoxic effects could be caused by other related fungus, _T.
- terreum_ was tested and investigated for the suspected myotoxicity.
- In this paper, we report four rare meroterpenoids, terreumols A–D (1–4), from the
  basidiomycete _T.
- terreum_.
- Notably, terreumols A–D (1–4) contain two C–C bonds between a benzene ring and the
  terpenoid moieties, building a rare 10-membered carbon ring that has been previously
  reported in wigandol from leaves and flowers of _Wigandia kunthii_,(10) flavidulols
  from the mushroom _Lactarius flavidulus_,(11) and globiferin from _Cordia globifera_.
- (12) The absolute configuration of terreumols A–D (1–4) was determined by X-ray
  diffraction.
- These compounds showed cytotoxic activity.
- Terreumol A (1) was isolated as yellow crystals.
- The molecular formula C17H20O6 was determined by HREIMS at _m_/_z_ 320.1258 (calcd
  for C17H20O6+, 320.1260), corresponding to eight degrees of unsaturation.
- The IR data at 3440 cm–1 revealed the presence of hydroxy groups, while the UV absorptions
  at 372 and 291 nm suggested the presence of a multiconjugated moiety.
- The 1D NMR spectra, as well as the HSQC spectrum, revealed 17 carbon resonances,
  which were ascribed to three methyls (including one methoxy), three methylenes,
  three methines (including one olefinic carbon), and eight quaternary carbons (Table
  1).
- Overall consideration of the NMR data suggested that compound 1 was a meroterpenoid
  similar to wigandol,(10) but highly oxygenated.
- In detail, one olefinic proton at δH 6.52 (1H, s, H-2), together with six olefinic
  carbons at δC 159.2 (s, C-1), 99.7 (d, C-2), 155.0 (s, C-3), 139.7 (s, C-4), 115.2
  (s, C-13), and 123.6 (s, C-14), indicated the presence of one five-substituted benzene
  ring.
- One downfield signal of a hydroxy proton at δH 11.97 (1H, s, OH-1) indicated the
  existence of one intramolecular hydrogen bond.
- In addition the proton (δH 11.97, s, OH-1) showed HMBC correlations to C-1, C-2,
  C-13 and δC 199.6 (s, C-12), indicating the carbonyl carbon (C-12) to be connected
  with the benzene ring at C-13, which was also supported by the UV absorptions at
  372 and 291 nm.
- In the HMBC spectrum (Figure 1), the correlations from another hydroxy proton at
  δH 7.85 (1H, s, OH-4) to δC 139.7 (s, C-4), 155.0 (s, C-3), and 123.6 (s, C-14),
  from δH 3.96 (3H, s, OCH3) to C-3, and from H-2 to C-3 allowed the hydroxy and the
  methoxy to be assigned at C-4 and C-3, respectively.
- The remaining 10 carbons (except for the above seven carbons consumed by the benzene
  and the methoxy group) were readily assigned to a monoterpenoid moiety, showing
  similarities to that of wigandol,(10) which formed a 10-membered ring system.
- The four oxygenated carbons at δC 60.4 (s, C-6), 66.1 (d, C-7), 64.7 (s, C-10),
  and 64.4 (d, C-11) suggested that the 1,5-diene in wigandol was replaced with two
  epoxy moieties in 1, as well as by the MS data; this was confirmed by analysis of
  the HMBC and 1H–1H COSY correlations (Figure 1).
- Detailed analysis of 2D NMR data identified the planar structure of 1.
- The ROESY spectrum could not completely determine the stereochemistry of 1 because
  of the 10-membered ring in the structure.
- Fortunately, an X-ray diffraction not only confirmed the planar structure of 1 but
  also determined the absolute configuration as shown in Figure 3.
- Figure 2.
- Key ROESY correlations and Chem3D structures showing stereoconfiguration of C-8
  in 2.
- Terreumol B (2) was isolated as a yellow powder.
- The HREIMS displayed an [M]+ peak at _m_/_z_ 336.1216 (calcd 336.1209), which analyzed
  for C17H20O7, 16 mass units more than that of 1.
- The UV absorptions at 362 and 286 nm together with the 13C NMR (Table 1) data were
  quite similar to those of compound 1, except that the methylene at δC 25.5 (C-8)
  was oxidized into a methine at δC 69.0, resulting in a downfield shift of C-7 (Δδ
  4.1 ppm) and C-9 (Δδ 8.5 ppm) in compound 2, consistent with the 1H–1H COSY correlations
  of H-7/H-8/H-9.
- Detailed analysis of 1D and 2D NMR data (HSQC, HMBC, 1H–1H COSY) suggested that
  the remainder of 2 was identical to that of 1.
- Biogenetically, the absolute configurations of C-6, C-7, C-10, and C-11 in 2 would
  be expected to be the same as those of 1.
- In the ROESY spectrum, the correlations among H-5b, H-8, and H3-16 were observed
  (Figure 2), which allowed H-8 to be placed on the same side as H3-16.
- In addition only the _S_ form can satisfy the ROESY correlations mentioned above,
  as shown by 3D structure models (Figure 2).
- Therefore, compound 2 was established as terreumol B, as shown.
- Terreum C (3), isolated as yellow needle crystals from acetone, had the molecular
  formula C17H20O5, according to its HREIMS at _m_/_z_ 304.1327 ([M]+, calcd 304.1311),
  16 mass units less than that of 1.
- The UV absorptions at 371 and 291 nm indicated that the multiconjugated moiety remained.
- By intensive comparison of the 1H and 13C NMR data (Table 1) with those of 1, the
  significant differences were the absence of two oxygenated carbon signals in 3 and
  the presence of a trisubstituted carbon double bond (δC 136.9, s; δC 125.0, d, δH
  5.43, t, _J_ = 8.3 Hz).
- In the 1H–1H COSY spectrum, the correlations of H-7/H-8 located the double bond
  between C-6 and C-7, which was further supported by the HMBC correlations from H-7
  (δH 5.43, t, _J_ = 8.3 Hz) to C-5 (δC 30.2, t), C-8 (δC 23.2, t), and C-9 (δC 38.1,
  t).
- Finally, the X-ray diffraction determined the absolute structure of 3 as shown in
  Figure 3.
- Terreum D (4) had an [M]+ peak at _m_/_z_ 320.1258 (C17H20O6) in the HREIMS, 16
  mass units more than that of 3.
- Compound 4 was readily identified as the 8-OH derivative of 3 from 1H and 13C NMR
  data at δC 66.1 (d, C-8) and δH 4.73 (1H, t, _J_ = 9.6 Hz, H-8) (Table 1), which
  was confirmed by the HMBC correlations from H-8 to C-6 (δC 135.5, s), C-7 (δC 130.2,
  d), C-9 (δC 46.6, t), and C-10 (62.0, s).
- Detailed analysis of the 2D NMR (HSQC, HMBC, and ROESY) data confirmed that the
  other parts were the same as those of 3.
- Finally, C-8 was determined to be _S_ configured, the same as that of 2.
- Thus, the structure of compound 4 was elucidated as terreum D, as shown.
- Compounds 1, 3, and 4 were evaluated for cytotoxicity against five human cancer
  cell lines using the MTT method as reported previously.
- (13) All three compounds showed comparable cytotoxicities with those of cisplatin,
  and their IC50 values are presented in Table 2.
- Melting points were obtained on a Yuhua X-4 digital microdisplaying melting point
  apparatus.
- Optical rotations were recorded on a JASCO P-1020 digital polarimeter.
- UV and the IR spectra were obtained on a Shimadzu UV2401PC and a Bruker Tensor 27
  FT-IR spectrometer with KBr pellets.
- Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were obtained on a Bruker Avance III 600
  MHz spectrometer with tetramethylsilane (TMS) as an internal standard at room temperature.
- High-resolution (HR) EIMS were recorded on a Waters AutoSpec Premier P776.
- X-ray diffractions were performed on an APEX DUO spectrophotometer.
- Silica gel (200–300 mesh, Qingdao Marine Chemical Ltd., People’s Republic of China)
  and reverse-phase C18 (RP-18) gel (20–45 μm, Fuji Silysia Chemical Ltd., Japan)
  were used for open column chromatography (CC).
- Preparative HPLC was performed on an Agilent 1100 liquid chromatography system equipped
  with a Zorbax SB-C18 column (9.4 mm × 150 mm).
- Fractions were monitored by TLC.
- Spots were visualized by heating silica gel plates immersed in vanillin–H2SO4 in
  ethanol.
- The mushroom _Tricholoma terreum_ was collected from southwestern France in 2011
  and identified by Prof. Zhu-Liang Yang, Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy
  of Sciences.
- A specimen (No.
- kib20111212) was deposited at Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences.
- The collection was permitted by the local forest authority.
- The dried fruiting bodies of _T.
- terreum_ (1.0 kg) were extracted with CHCl3–MeOH (1:1).
- The extract was separated by solvent partition between EtOAc and water.
- The EtOAc layer was concentrated under reduced pressure to give a crude extract
  (23 g), and this residue was subjected to silica gel CC, eluted with a gradient
  of CHCl3–MeOH (1:0 → 0:1), to obtain seven fractions (A–G).
- Fraction C was separated by RP-18 (MeOH–H2O, 50–100%) to give 14 subfractions (C1–C14).
- Fraction C6 was subjected to silica gel CC (petroleum ether–EtOAc, 4:1) and further
  purified by semipreparatiive HPLC (15–40%, MeCN–H2O, 10 mL/min, 30 min) to yield
  2 (0.8 mg) and 4 (1.0 mg).
- Fraction C7 was purified by silica gel CC (petroleum ether–EtOAc, 6:1) to obtain
