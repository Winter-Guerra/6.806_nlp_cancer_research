- The aim of this study was to determine the nutritional quality and protein value
  of the baru almond, pequi almond, and cerrado cashew nut compared to the peanut.
- We determined the proximate chemical composition, mineral content, and amino acid
  profile.
- A biological assay was carried out to assess the protein value, by net protein ratio
  (NPR), relative net protein ratio (RNPR), and protein digestibility-corrected amino
  acid score (PDCAAS) indexes.
- We found that the exotic almonds and the nut are rich in proteins (22.7-29.9 g/100
  g), lipids (41.9-50.0 g/100 g), fibres (baru and pequi almonds, around 10.0 g/100
  g), iron and zinc (4.3-7.4 mg/100 g).
- Baru almond's protein did not show deficiency in essential amino acids and lysine
  was the first limiting amino acid in the proteins of the pequi almond and cerrado
  cashew nut.
- The baru almond showed a RNPR of 86%, similar to that of the cerrado cashew nut
  (78%), but higher than that of the peanut (72%) and of the pequi almond (54%).
- The PDCAAS value of the baru almond (91%) was the highest and cerrado cashew nut
  and peanut presented similar values of this index (82%), which were higher than
  that of the pequi almond (55%).
- The baru almond has the highest protein quality, but the cerrado cashew nut and
  peanut are sources of good quality protein, too.
- We recommend the inclusion of these exotic foods in healthy diets and in food industry,
  and the baru almond and cerrado cashew nut as sources of complementary protein.
