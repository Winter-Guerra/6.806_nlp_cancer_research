- Ethyl carbamate has been associated with cancer for several decades.
- It is mainly found in fermented foods and beverages.
- In view of the importance of fermented foods in the Korean diet and the significant
  level of ethyl carbamate expected, we determined ethyl carbamate concentrations
  in some of the staple food items and estimated the daily intake for the Korean population.
- Ethyl carbamate in commercial samples of kimchi, soy sauce, vinegar, soybean paste,
  and alcoholic beverages were determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry/selective
  ion monitoring (GC-MS/SIM).
- Homemade soy sauce and kimchi were also analysed.
- The maximum ethyl carbamate concentrations observed were 73 micrograms/kg in soy
  sauce, 7.9 micrograms/kg in soybean paste, 2.5 micrograms/l in vinegar, 16.2 micrograms/kg
  in kimchi and 15.4 mu/l in Korean traditional alcoholic beverages.
- Combining these values with the average daily food intake data, we estimated that
  the maximum daily exposure of Korean population to ethyl carbamate is 2.8 micrograms/day,
  which is not a negligible amount considering the 'virtually safe dose' derived by
  animal experiment ranges between 1.2 and 4.8 micrograms/day.
- It would be desirable to closely monitor ethyl carbamate levels in Korean foods
  and to find ways to reduce the daily intake.
