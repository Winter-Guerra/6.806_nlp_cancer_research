- In breast cancer cells, overexpression of human epidermal growth factor receptor
  2 (HER2) increases the translation of fatty acid synthase (FASN) by altering the
  activity of PI3K/Akt signaling pathways.
- Cancer chemotherapy causes major side effects and is not effective enough in slowing
  down the progression of the disease.
- Earlier studies showed a role for resveratrol in the inhibition of FASN, but the
  molecular mechanisms of resveratrol-induced inhibition are not known.
- In the present study, we examined the novel mechanism of resveratrol on Her2-overexpressed
  breast cancer cells.
