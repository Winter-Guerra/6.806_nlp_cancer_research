- This study was conducted to quantitatively determine the fatty acid contents of
  20 species of marine fish and four species of shellfish from Straits of Malacca.
- Most samples contained fairly high amounts of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs),
  especially alpha-linolenic acid (ALA, C18:3 n3), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, C20:5
  n3), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, C22:6 n3).
- Longtail shad, yellowstripe scad, and moonfish contained significantly higher ()
  amounts of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and alpha-linolenic
  acid (ALA), respectively.
- Meanwhile, fringescale sardinella, malabar red snapper, black pomfret, Japanese
  threadfin bream, giant seaperch, and sixbar grouper showed considerably high content
  (537.2–944.1 mg/100g wet sample) of desirable omega-3 fatty acids.
- The polyunsaturated-fatty-acids/saturated-fatty-acids (P/S) ratios for most samples
  were higher than that of Menhaden oil (), a recommended PUFA supplement which may
  help to lower blood pressure.
- Yellowstripe scad (highest DHA, , ), moonfish (highest ALA, , ), and longtail shad
  (highest EPA, , ) were the samples with an outstandingly desirable overall composition
  of fatty acids.
- Overall, the marine fish and shellfish from the area contained good composition
  of fatty acids which offer health benefits and may be used for nutraceutical purposes
  in the future.
- Fish and shellfish are widely accepted as highly nutritious and healthy foods.
- However, people usually think that different types of fish are of similar nutritional
  value, and fish selections are made only based on availability, freshness, flavor,
  and other physical factors [1].
- Based on the Malaysian Adult Nutrition Survey (2002-2003), the prevalence of daily
  consumption of marine fish among rural and urban adults were quite high at 51% and
  34%, respectively [2].
- Therefore, it is crucial to increase the awareness of different nutrient contents
  of fish and shellfish species by providing complete nutritional value information,
  especially for fatty acid content, which is associated with various health-related
  effects.
- Nutritional analysis of fatty acids can be classified as qualitative and quantitative.
- Qualitative analysis of fatty acid produces data regarding the fatty acid composition
  in the form of percentages of total fatty acids (% of total fatty acids).
- Meanwhile, quantitative analysis is able to quantify the actual amount (weight)
  of each fatty acid that is present in the food.
- Quantitative data are often presented in the form of weight of the fatty acid per
  weight of food or fat (e.g., mg/g oil).
- Currently, there are limited qualitative fatty acid data on marine fish and shellfish
  from warm water area; meanwhile, no quantitative data are available especially as
  a mean to utilize source of natural product for nutraceutical purposes.
- Reliable analytical data are prerequisite for correct interpretation of findings
  in nutritional content analysis, since unreliable results may lead to over- or underestimations,
  false interpretations, and unwarranted conclusions [3].
- Thus, validation procedures of analytical methods were also performed to provide
  reliable quantitative data on the fatty acid contents of various species of local
  marine fish and shellfish.
- All chemicals and reagents used for analysis were of analytical and gas chromatography
  (GC) grade.
- Menhaden oil, 37 components FAME mix 47885-U (Supelco, Germany), and tridecanoic
  acid (C13, internal standard, Sigma, USA) were used as standards in the fatty acid
  content analysis.
- A stratified random sampling procedure was used as it was the most suitable method
  in database work [4].
- To ensure representativeness, ten fish landing areas along the Straits of Malacca
  were identified with the help of Malaysian Fisheries Development Authority (LKIM).
- The locations are marked as L1 through L10, respectively (Figure 1).
- At each of the collection sites, available samples were collected randomly according
  to species.
- All samples were from free-roaming fish and shellfish; and they were collected fresh
  (caught within a period of 0 to 36 hours).
- All samples were immediately placed on ice, kept cold, and transported in polystyrene
  boxes to maintain freshness.
- Upon arrival at Universiti Putra Malaysia, the temperature of ice boxes was checked
  to ensure samples were still within the range of −4°C to 0°C.
- Then, samples for nutrient determination were individually measured for total body
  weight and length.
- Only samples of a weight within the narrow range for each species were included
  as primary samples (Table 1).
- Then, the samples were beheaded, gutted, washed, and filleted.
- These primary samples were placed in sealed plastic bags and frozen at −20°C.
- The actual degree of freshness of samples during transportation and time of analysis
  may not be assured as there was no analysis of freshness or quality index of samples
  was done.
- However, appropriate precautions were performed to sustain freshness of samples
  and minimize oxidation throughout the study by performing procedures in chillers’
  room (4°C) and under minimal light exposures.
- A small-scale experiment performed independently showed insignificant differences
  in nutrient contents of samples from different locations.
- This observation justified that units of primary samples can be combined or composited
  by geographical locations to minimize the number of analytical measurements and
  yet represent the contribution of the unit to the estimate of central tendency [4].
- Thus, before analysis, three composite samples were prepared by mixing individual
  samples (–12, whole fillets) of the same weight for each species.
- Individual samples from L1, L2, L3, and L4 constituted as Composite 1; individual
  samples from L5, L6, and L7 constituted as Composite 2; while individual samples
  from L8, L9, and L10 constituted as Composite 3 (Figure 1).
- All composite samples were analyzed separately and data presented are the mean values
  of each of the species.
- Extraction of fat was done following Bligh and Dyer [6], with slight modifications
  by Kinsella et al.
- '[7].'
- Representative samples of fish filets (30 g) were homogenized in a Waring blender
  for 2 min with a mixture of methanol (60 mL) and chloroform (30 mL).
- One volume of chloroform (30 mL) was added to the mixture and after blending for
  additional 30 seconds, distilled water (30 mL) was added.
- The homogenate was stirred with a glass rod and filtered through Whatman No.
- 1 filter paper on a Buchner funnel with slight suction.
- The filtrate was transferred to a separatory funnel.
- The lower clear phase was drained into a 250 mL round-bottom flask and concentrated
  with a rotary evaporator at 40°C.
- To minimize oxidation, the extracted lipids were kept in solvents containing 0.05%
  butylated hydroxytoluene (B.H.T.
- ), in glass bottles, flushed with nitrogen, and wrapped with aluminium foils to
  avoid any light exposure.
- Then, the bottles were stored immediately at −20°C and only being taken out from
  freezer just before analysis.
- Lipid samples were converted to their constituent FAMEs following the method used
  in previous study [8].
- Approximately 25 mg (±0.1 mg) of oil was weighed and added with 1.5 mL of NaOH 0.50
  M in methanol in a 15 mL capped centrifuge tube.
- The mixture was heated in a water bath at 100°C for 5 min and then cooled at room
  temperature.
- The mixture was added with 2.0 mL of boron trifluoride (BF3, 12%) in methanol and
  heated again in a water bath at 100°C for 30 minutes.
- Next, the tube was cooled in running water at room temperature before adding 1 mL
  of isooctane.
- It was vigorously stirred for 30 seconds before adding 5.0 mL of a saturated sodium
  chloride solution to facilitate the phase separation.
- The esterified sample was placed in a refrigerator and left to rest for better phase
  separation.
- After collecting the supernatant, another 1.0 mL of isooctane (containing 0.05%
  B.H.T.
- as antioxidant) was added into the tube and stirred.
- The supernatant was collected and added to the previous fraction.
- The sample was concentrated to a final volume of 1.0 mL for later injection into
  the gas chromatograph.
- As precautions, amber vials were used in order to minimize oxidation during analysis.
- _Analysis of Gas Chromatography (GC)_.
- Analysis of methyl esters was performed by a capillary gas chromatograph model Agilent
  6890 (USA Agilent Technology) equipped with a split-splitless injector, flame ionization
  detection (FID) system used to separate and quantify each FAME component.
- FAMEs were separated using a highly polar HP88 column (Agilent, USA) column (100
  m length  0.25 mm I.D.
- 0.2 m D.F.).
- Carrier gas was helium at a linear velocity of 30.0 mL/min.
- 'Split injection with a split ratio (volume of gas passing to waste: volume of gas
  passing down the capillary column) of 10 : 1 and 99.9 mL/min split flow was used.'
- The operating conditions were 250°C injection port, 250°C flame ionization detector,
  and 200°C column temperature.
- Compounds were identified by comparison of the retention times of 37 components
  FAME mix 47885-U (Supelco, Germany) and Menhaden oil standards (Supelco, Germany).
- _Quantification of Fatty Acids_.
- The concentration of fatty acids in mg/g of total lipids was measured against tridecanoic
  acid methyl ester (C13:0, Sigma, USA) as an internal standard.
- This followed procedures described in a previous study [6] with slight modifications;
  in which the Empirical Response Factor () of FID (flame ionization detector) was
  calculated and used instead of theoretical response factor ().
- Calculation of the empirical response factor () was done as described in the literature
  [9].
- 'The following formulae were used in the quantification of fatty acids: (i)where
  Psi: peak area of individual fatty acids in mixed FAME standard solution, PsIS:
  peak area of fatty acid internal standard in mixed FAME standard solution, WISm:
  weight of fatty acid internal standard in mixed FAME standard solution, and Wi:
  weight of individual FAME in mixed FAME standard solution;(ii) where AX: peak area
  of fatty acid, AIS: peak area of internal standard (IS) WIS: weight (mg) of IS added
  to the sample (mg), WX: sample weight (mg), Ri: empirical response factor, and 1.04:
  conversion factor necessary to express results in mg fatty acid/g oil (rather than
  as methyl ester).'
- _Linearity Test_.
- 'Three fatty acid standards, myristic acid, heptadecanoic acid, and linoleic acid
  were prepared at different concentrations: myristic acid (0.4, 2.0, and 4.0 mg/mL),
  heptadecanoicacid (0.4, 2.0, and 4.0 mg/mL), linoleic acid (0.5, 1.0, and 5.0 mg/mL).'
- These fatty acid standards were used as they represent both saturated and unsaturated
  fatty acids present in samples.
- Calibration curves were formed for each of the compounds.
- The linearity parameters, which included linear regression () and the correlation
  coefficient () were obtained from the linear relationship between the peak area
  and the concentrations of the fatty acid standards.
- _Precision Test_.
- Two precision tests of repeatability (within-day) and reproducibility (between-day)
  were performed.
- Two fatty acid standards were quantified in three randomly selected samples in both
  tests.
- For repeatability (within-day precision), four replicates of each sample were analyzed
  in a single day using the same procedures as in the fatty acid analysis.
- Data are reported as relative standard deviations (RSD) of four replicates, with
  minimum and maximum values of both palmitic and linolenic acids quantified in each
  sample.
- For reproducibility (between-day precision), samples were analyzed using the same
  procedures as in the fatty acid analysis on three different days, representing three
  replicates of each sample.
- Palmitic acid and linolenic acids were quantified and presented as relative standard
  deviations (RSD) of three replicates, with minimum and maximum values of each fatty
  acid.
- _Recovery Test_.
- The recovery of the method was determined using three different concentrations (0.4,
  2.0, 4.0 mg/mL) of myristic acid, heptadecanoic acid, and stearic acid standards.
- Two samples were randomly selected and used for the recovery analysis of each of
  the fatty acid standards.
- During the sample preparation, each standard was added together with lipid extract
  and internal standards and prepared following the same procedures used in normal
  sample preparation.
- Recoveries of different standards were performed separately to avoid overlapping
  of peaks in chromatograms which could lead to biased results.
- Recoveries of fatty acid standards at different concentrations were determined by
  comparing the content of the fatty acids in samples with and without the addition
  of the standard.
- Data are presented as the percentage of recovery.
- _Statistical Analysis_.
- Data were analyzed using SPSS (Scientific Package of Social Science) version 17.0.
- The mean, standard deviation (SD), and one-way ANOVA test followed by Tukey post-hoc
  analysis were performed to compare differences in the mean fatty acid contents of
  different species of fish and shellfish.
- Bivariate correlation (Pearson’s ) was performed to explore the relationships between
  different fatty acid classes in samples.
- Data from this study are reported in the form of milligrams per 100 grams of wet
  muscle.
- Tables 2, 3, and 4 show the sample content of saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated
  fatty acids, respectively.
- Based on the previous findings, the studied fish samples can be categorized into
  lean-, low-, medium-, and high-fat fish based on the fat content [5].
- Among the lean-fish, hardtail scad was high in saturated fatty acids (SFAs), with
  palmitic acid as the highest (531.7 mg/100 g wet sample) (Table 2).
- The monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) of the fish was 121.2 mg/100 g wet sample;
  with fairly high oleic acid (C18:1n9c) and heptadecenoic acid (C17:1), at 63.9 and
  45.7 mg/100 g wet sample, respectively (Table 3).
- For PUFA, hardtail scad contained quite high amounts of DHA (C22:6n3), at 196.0
  mg/100 g wet sample, followed by ALA (C18:3n3) at 117.3 mg/100 g wet sample (Table
  4).
- Meanwhile, malabar red snapper was higher in PUFA, characterized by high DHA (C22:6n3)
  at 209.9 mg/100 g wet sample, followed by ALA (C18:3n3) at 335.0 mg/100 g wet sample
  (Table 4).
- For SFA, palmitic acid was the dominant fatty acid (373.7 mg/100 g wet sample),
  followed by caprylic acid at 112.8 mg/100 g wet sample (Table 2).
- The MUFA content was 141.8 mg/100 g wet sample, with fairly high oleic acid (C18:1
  n9c) at 119.5 mg/100 g wet sample (Table 3).
- Among the low-fat fish, yellowstripe scad contained a very high PUFA content, with
  significantly higher () levels of DHA (782.1 mg/100 g wet sample) compared to other
  samples (Table 4).
- The DHA amount was about 2.7 times higher than Japanese threadfin bream (2nd highest
  DHA, 293.0 mg/100 g wet sample); and about 86.6 times higher than long-tailed butterfly
  ray (lowest DHA, 9.0 mg/100 g wet sample).
- Additionally, yellowstripe scad also had a high ALA (C18:3n3) level at 338.1 mg/100
  g wet sample.
- For SFA and MUFA, the most dominant fatty acids were palmitic acid (560.8 mg/100
  g wet sample) and oleic acid (188.8 mg/100 g wet sample), respectively (Tables 2
  and 3).
- The medium-fat fish, moonfish, showed palmitic acid as the most prominent fatty
  acid (1308.0 mg/100 g wet sample) (Table 2).
- This was followed by _α_-linolenic acid (C18:3n3) at 1046.8 mg/100 g wet sample,
  which was significantly higher () compared to the others (Table 4).
- Other  fatty acids, such as eicosatrienoic acid (C20:3n3), EPA (C20:5n3), and DHA
  (C22:6n3) were at 257.6, 176.7, and 122.6 mg/100 g wet sample, respectively.
- Its  fatty acid content, linolelaidic acid (C18:2n6t, 637.7 mg/100 g wet sample)
  and linoleic acid (C18:2n6c, 215.3 mg/100 g wet sample), were the second highest
  after level in longtail shad (linolelaidic acid at 2254.1 mg/100 g and linoleic
  acid at 1327.4 mg/100 g wet sample), respectively.
- Meanwhile, for MUFA, the most dominant fatty acid was oleic acid (C18:1n9c), at
  398.5 mg/100 g wet sample.
- Moonfish also contained significantly higher (Tukey post-hoc test, ) of heptadecenoic
  acid (C17:1, 81.5 mg/100 g wet sample) compared to others (Table 3).
- The high-fat fish, longtail shad also showed palmitic acid (C16:0) as the dominant
  fatty acid (12542.6 mg/100 g wet muscle, Table 2).
- For MUFA, longtail shad contained significantly higher (Tukey post-hoc test, ) of
  palmitoleic acid (C16:1, 458.1 mg/100 g wet sample) and oleic acid (C18:1n9c, 2554.4
  mg/100 g wet sample) compared to others (Table 3).
- While for PUFA, the fish contained significantly higher (Tukey post-hoc test, )
  of EPA (C20:5 n3, 2041.8 mg/100 g wet sample) and eicosatrienoicacid (C20:3n3, 437.5
  mg/100 g wet sample) compared to others (Table 4).
- Besides, longtail shad was also high in  fatty acids; with linolelaidic acid (C18:2n6t)
  at 2254.1 mg/100 g wet muscle, and linoleic acid (C18:2n6c) at 1327.4 mg/100 g wet
  muscle.
- As in most of fish samples, shellfish including cuttlefish, cockles, and oyster
  also showed palmitic acid (C16:0) as the most prominent fatty acid (Table 2).
- Meanwhile, prawn showed caprylic acid (C8:0) as the highest fatty acid (139.9 mg/100
  g wet sample), followed by palmitic acid (C16:0) at 125.3 mg/100 g wet sample.
- For MUFA, cockles contained higher oleic acid (C18:1n9c, 303.8 mg/100 g wet sample)
  compared to other shellfish (Table 3).
- While for PUFA, cockles were found to be higher in both EPA (C20:5n3, 343.0 mg/100
  g wet sample) and DHA (C22:6n3, 123.4 mg/100 g wet sample), compared to other shellfish
  (Table 4).
- However, the content of alpha-linolenic acid (C18:3n3) in cockles (18.6 mg/100 g
  wet sample) was the lowest among all samples; with cuttlefish (251.1 mg/100 g wet
  sample), prawn (320.4 mg/100 g wet sample), and oysterr (100.7 mg/100 g wet sample).
- Most of previous local studies have focused on qualitative aspects of fat content
  in various samples of marine and freshwater origin samples [10–15].
- A previous study found very high percentage of PUFA; with omega-3 PUFA (29.7–48.4%),
  other PUFA (27.7–40.0%), and omega-6 PUFA (11.0–20.0%) in ten common fish species
  with the current study [9].
- Meanwhile, percentages of SFA and MUFA were quite low; at 3.63–11.4% and 1.37–9.12%,
  respectively.
- This study found hexadecadienoic acid as the most prominent fatty acid (18.1–24.9%)
  in six samples, hexadecatrienoic acid (C16:3n4) in two samples, and hexadecadienoic
  acid (C16:2) in other two samples [10].
- Another local study reported PUFA as the dominant group of fatty acid in seven species,
  and SFA as the dominant fatty acid group in another six species of their fish samples
  [11].
- Palmitic acid (C16:0) was the most prominent fatty acid (17.6–32.1%) in eight samples;
  meanwhile, DHA (C22:6n3) was the highest fatty acid (19.3–24.0%) in another five
  samples [11].
- Same findings were reported by other study of 16 species of local pelagic fish;
  with palmitic acid (C16:0) as the most prominent fatty acid (20.9–34.5%) in nine
  species, meanwhile, DHA (C22:6n3) was the highest fatty acid (26.0–29.8%) in another
  seven species [12].
- The current study, however, focuses on the quantitative aspect of samples fat thus
  allow limited comparison be made with these previous local data.
- However, there were a few studies focused on the quantitative aspects of fatty acids
  in other cold water species of marine and freshwater fish and shellfish performed
  in other countries.
- The comparisons made with the previous findings would be useful in giving better
  overview of the content of fatty acids in local marine fish and shellfish.
- One of the previous quantitative studies of fatty acids had reported the  and  fatty
  acids content in different types (wild, farmed, supermarket, and feed) of salmon
  from North America and Europe [16].
- Linoleic acid (C18:2n6) were at 67, 647, 604, and 1719 mg/100 g muscles for wild
  salmon, farmed salmon, supermarket salmon, and salmon feed [16]; which were higher
  than most of the samples (4.3–215.3 mg/100 g wet sample) in current study (Table
  4).
- However, longtail shad is comparable in linoleic acid content with salmon feed,
  at 1327.4 mg/100 g wet sample [16].
- This previous study also reported low _γ_-linolenic acid (C18:3n6) at 3 mg/100 g
  (wild salmon), 14 mg/100 g (farmed salmon), 13 mg/100 g (supermarket salmon), and
  40 mg/100 g (salmon feed) [16].
- Only three samples in current study were found to contain this fatty acid; hard
  tail scad (1.6 mg/100 g), silver pomfret (10.9 mg/100 g), and black pomfret (29.1
  mg/100 g), which were comparable with their findings [16].
- For _α_-linolenic acid (C18:3n3), most samples in current study contained about
  100–300 mg/100 g of this fatty acid; which were higher than wild salmon (50 mg/100
  g), comparable with farmed salmon (181 mg/100 g) and supermarket salmon (168 mg/100
  g), meanwhile were lower when compared to salmon feed (505 mg/100 g) [16].
- Most samples in current study contained lower EPA (C20:5n3, 2.7–343.0 mg/100 g wet
  sample) compared to wild salmon (414 mg/100 g), farmed salmon (1079 mg/100 g), supermarket
  salmon (969 mg/100 g), and salmon feed (2638 mg/100 g) [16].
- Only longtail shad was found to contain comparable amount of EPA with salmon feed;
  at 2638 mg/100 g wet sample [16].
- It is really interesting to find such a high level of EPA in longtail shad, as high
  intake of this fatty acid had been related with protective effects to the occurrence
  of asthma, coronary heart problems and many other diseases [17–19].
- Meanwhile, compared to DHA values (629–2633 mg/100 g) reported by the previous study
  [16], the content of this fatty acid in most samples of the current study were lower
  (9.0–277.1 mg/100 g wet sample).
- However, yellowstripe scad (782.1 mg/100 g wet sample) was found to contain slightly
  higher DHA content compared to wild salmon (629 mg/100 g) [16].
- Data from National Nutrient Data by United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)
  showed Greenland halibut, farmed catfish, wild catfish, farmed salmon, and wild
  salmon contained  at 1177.6, 177.6, 236.5, 2147.1, and 1840 mg/100 g muscles [20].
- Generally, most samples in the current study contained  amounts (11.8–551.7 mg/100
  g wet sample); which were lower compared to Greenland halibut, farmed salmon, and
  wild salmon; but comparable with farmed and wild catfish.
- However, longtail shad (2210 mg/100 g wet sample) was found to contain  at comparable
  amount with farmed and wild salmon [20].
- This could be due to the high fat content of the fish (23.2% fat) [5].
- The current study is novel as it provides new quantitative findings for warm water
  species of fish and shellfish.
- Moreover, the findings are of necessary representativeness, which resulted from
  systematic sampling procedures performed.
- Data from the current study is also highly important as it represents samples from
  the Straits of Malacca, which aligns the west coast of Peninsular Malaysia, the
  main contributor of marine landings production in the country which produced 50.16%
  of the total marine landings production of Malaysia and 67.34% of the marine landings
  production of peninsular areas (Department of Fisheries Malaysia, 2007).
- Overall, seventeen species of samples contained SFA as the dominant group of fatty
  acid (Table 5), with palmitic acid (C16:0) as the highest fatty acid quantified
  in most of samples (Table 2).
- The high amount of palmitic acid is due to its function as a key metabolite in fish,
  and the level is not influenced by the diet [21].
- Meanwhile, seven of the samples (golden snapper, Indian threadfin, malabar red snapper,
  long-tailed butterfly ray, large-scale tongue sole, yellowstripe scad, and prawn)
  contained PUFA as the dominant group of fatty acid.
- Generally, the PUFA to SFA (P/S) ratios of most of the samples of this study (Table
  5) were above the value for Menhaden oil (0.58); as suggested by Food and Drug Association
  (FDA) as PUFA supplement [22].
- Besides, ratios exceeding 0.50 have also been shown to lower blood cholesterol level
  [23].
- Among the lean fish, hardtail scad and Indian mackerel contained fairly high SFA
  but fairly low PUFA; which resulted in low P/S ratio of 0.6 and 0.3, respectively.
- Meanwhile, other lean fish showed higher P/S ratios, between 0.6 and 1.4.
- For low-fat fish, four-finger threadfin showed low P/S ratio of 0.5.
- Other low-fat fish showed P/S ratio between 0.6 and 1.7.
- While for the medium fat fish, moonfish contained quite high P/S ratio of 1.0.
- The high-fat fish, longtail shad contained higher SFA content compared to PUFA that
  resulted in low P/S ratio of 0.4.
- Overall, most of samples contained favorable ratio of fatty acids, which was beneficial
  for PUFA intake and lowering blood cholesterol [22, 23].
- There is no specific trend in levels of saturation or unsaturation relative to the
  fat content of samples.
- On the other hand, a very high positive correlation was found between fat content
  of samples with all three classes of fatty acids; SFA (Pearson’s , ), MUFA (Pearson’s
  , ), and PUFA (Pearson’s , ).
- 'This suggested that increment in fat content is followed by increment in the content
  of all forms of fatty acids: SFA, MUFA, and PUFA in the samples.'
- 'The −3 :  ratio has been suggested as a useful indicator for comparing relative
  nutritional values of fish oils.'
- The ratio is also expressed in the form of /.
- 'It has been suggested that an −3 :  ratio of 1 : 1 to 1 : 5 (or / between 0.2 and
  1.0) would constitute a healthy human diet [22].'
- 'High  :  ratio is preferred, as excess  fatty acids can counteract the health benefits
  of  fatty acid intake [24].'
- Overall, long-tailed butterfly ray and cuttlefish had very high ratios of /, at
  13.3 and 15.3, respectively (Table 5).
- However, the high ratio was not contributed to by high  fatty acids, but by the
  low content of  fatty acids.
- These fish contained 349.3 and 472.9 mg/100 g wet samples of  fatty acids, respectively,
  which were within the common range of other samples.
- Meanwhile, their  fatty acids contents were only 26.3 mg/100 g wet sample for long-tailed
  butterfly ray, and 30.9 mg/100 g wet sample for cuttlefish.
- The same reason applied to the fairly high ratio of / at 9.8, 8.7, 7.8, and 7.3
  for another four samples; namely, Indian threadfin, prawn, large-scale tongue sole,
  and Spanish mackerel.
- These samples contained  fatty acids between 235.9 and 414.3 mg/100 g wet samples;
  meanwhile their  fatty acids were below than 40 mg/100 g wet sample.
- While for yellowstripe scad, the high ratio of / was contributed by its high content
  of  fatty acids (1224.8 mg/100 g wet sample) compared to  fatty acids (192.2 mg/100
  g wet sample).
- 'In contrast, longtail shad contained high content of  fatty, resulted in fairly
  low ratio of −3 :  (0.8), which was the lowest among all samples.'
- A few validation analyses were performed to ensure the reliability of the method
  used for fatty acid analysis in this study; these measures included linearity, precision
  (repeatability and reproducibility), and recovery tests.
- 'Linear relationships were observed for myristic acid (C14:0) standard (linearity
  parameters: ; ), heptadecanoic acid (C17:0) standard (linearity parameters: ; ),
  and linoleic acid (C18:2n6) standard (linearity parameters: ; ).'
- The precision test assessed both repeatability (within-day) and reproducibility
  (between-day) tests.
- Table 6 shows the RSD values for the repeatability test of fatty acids; these values
  ranged between 1.4–3.6% for palmitic acid and 0.2–1.9% for linolenic acid.
- Meanwhile, Table 7 shows the RSD values for the reproducibility test, which ranged
  between 0.9–2.4% for palmitic acid, and 0.16–1.86% for linolenic acid.
- The RSD values in this study were lower compared to most RSD values (3.1–13.3%)
  as reported previously [25], but were higher when compared with excellent RSD values
  (&lt;2.0%) reported by another study [26].
- However, from overall, the RSD values in all repeatability and reproducibility tests
  were satisfactory and showed that the methods used were reliable to produce precise
  data for multiple determinations of fatty acids (saturated and unsaturated) in fish
  and shellfish samples, both in a single-day and multiple-day determinations.
- Meanwhile, the percentages of recoveries for different concentrations of myristic
  acid were between 90.3–105.6% in golden snapper and 106.8–119.4% in cockles (Table
  8).
- Meanwhile for heptadecanoic acid, the percentages of recoveries were between 87.1–111.9%
  in golden snapper and 112.8–115.9% in cockles.
- For stearic acid, the range of 93.4−108.8% in cockles.
- Overall, the recovery percentages were satisfactory, at about 90–120%, which is
  comparable to the values (most showed 80–120%) reported by previous studies [25,
  27].
- This shows that the methods used in the analysis are highly accurate for determinations
  of fatty acid contents at various concentrations in fish and shellfish samples.
- Overall, most of the marine fish and shellfish samples contained desirable compositions
  of fatty acids with a fairly high amount of  fatty acids, a suitable ratio of /
  fatty acids, and preferable P/S ratios which were higher than the level in the recommended
  PUFA supplement, Menhaden oil.
- 'Three samples were identified as being outstanding in their desirable overall composition
  of fatty acids: yellowstripe scad (highest DHA, , P/S = 1.7), moonfish (highest
  ALA, , P/S = 1.0), and longtail shad (highest EPA, , P/S = 0.4).'
- These findings showed that marine fish and shellfish from warm water area contain
  a good composition of fatty acids and could provide many health benefits if consumed
  regularly.
- These reliable and representative data are very useful to develop a nutritional
  database of marine fish and shellfish from warm water area and as reference to people
  for intake locally and globally.
- Additionally, the findings also showed that some identified species of fish and
  shellfish from this area may have possible value in terms of future manipulation
  for various nutraceutical purposes.
- However, further studies should be developed on this matter.
