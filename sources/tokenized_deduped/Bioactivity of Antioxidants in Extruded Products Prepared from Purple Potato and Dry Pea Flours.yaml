- Measuring antioxidant activity using a biologically relevant assay adds important
  evidence to aid in understanding the role of phytochemicals based on data from in
  vivo and chemical assays of extrusion processed purple potato and pea flours.
- A cellular antioxidant activity assay could provide biologically relevant information
  on bioactive compounds in raw as well as processed food products.
- The objective of this study was to investigate the complete phytochemical profiles,
  antioxidant activity, cellular antioxidant activity, and their contribution to bioactivity
  in purple potato flour, dry pea flour, raw formulations, and extrusion cooked products
  prepared with the above ingredients.
- The free fraction of extracts contributed 68, 64, and 88% to total phenolics, total
  antioxidant activity (ORAC value), and total flavonoids, respectively, in purple
  potato flour (PPF).
- Similarly, extracts in the free fraction contributed 87, 86, and 64% to total phenolics,
  total antioxidant activity (ORAC value), and total flavonoids, respectively, in
  dry pea flour (DPF).
- The amount of total phenolics and total flavonoids in purple potato flour and the
  antioxidant activity of PPF and DPF were comparable to published data.
- However, a higher amount in the total flavonoids and lower in the total phenolics
  of DPF were observed.
- Caffeic, _p_-coumaric, and ferulic acids were mostly observed in the bound extracts
  of raw formulations as in the extrudates, whereas chlorogenic acid was predominant
  in the free extracts.
- The extruded products had significantly higher (_p_ &lt; 0.05) content of total
  phenolics, ORAC antioxidant activity, and flavonoids, compared to the raw formulations.
- Extrusion processing increased the cellular antioxidant activity of the extrudates
  prepared from 35:65 and 50:50 PPF/DPF (w/w) of ingredients compared with control
  raw formulations in a dose-dependent manner.
- Increase of PPF significantly increased (_p_ &lt; 0.05) the cellular antioxidant
  activity of 35–50% PPF formulations.

  Processed fruits and vegetables are generally believed to have less naturally occurring
  antioxidants than fresh products, resulting in reduced health benefits.'
- One of the major reasons for this belief has been the measurement of antioxidant
  activity focused solely on vitamin C levels in foods as an indicator for health
  benefits of processed products.
- (1-4) However, Eberhardt et al.
- (5) observed that vitamin C contributed &lt;0.4% to the total antioxidant activity
  in apples, indicating the importance of other phytochemicals toward total antioxidant
  activity in foods.
- Antioxidant compounds derived from fruits and vegetables act to prevent the formation
  of reactive oxygen, nitrogen, hydroxyl, and lipid species either by scavenging free
  radicals or by repairing or removing damaged molecules.
- (6) Bioactive phytochemicals are proposed to prevent chronic diseases such as cardiovascular
  disease, diabetes, and certain forms of cancers.
- (7-10) Bioactive phytochemicals exist in free, soluble-conjugated, and bound forms.
- (11) Bound phytochemicals, mostly in cell wall materials, are difficult to digest
  in the upper gastrointestine and may be digested by bacteria in the colon to provide
  health benefits and reduce the risk of colon cancer.
- (12) Only a small portion of flavonoids absorbed across the intestinal membrane
  are partly transformed to glucuronides and sulfates; however, the majority of the
  flavonoids are degraded by intestinal microflora.
- Several phenolic acids are produced by bacterial enzymes utilizing hydrolysis, dehydroxylation,
  cleavage of the heterocyclic oxygen-containing ring, and decarboxylation of flavonoids.
- Reabsorption of these phenolic acids increases the antioxidant protection with their
  radical scavenging ability.

  Many researchers have reviewed and documented the contributions of phenolic compounds
  including anthocyanins, individual phenolic acids, and carotenoids present in white
  and colored potato skin and flesh to antioxidant activity.'
- (14-16) Wounding, boiling, baking, drum-drying, freeze-drying, and microwave cooking
  of white and colored potatoes had different effects on the total phenolic content.
- (17-19) Potato protein hydrolysate inhibited lipid oxidation of beef patties by
  scavenging free radicals,(20) and potato peel extracts retarded oxidation in radiation-processed
  lamb meat.
- '(21)


  Legumes such as dry peas are rich sources of protein and dietary fiber.'
- Consumption of legumes helps prevent osteoporosis(22) and certain cancers(23) and
  reduces body lipid accumulation.
- (24) Various effects of thermally processed legumes on antioxidant activity, phenolic
  content, and potential health benefits were reported.
- (25, 26) The combination of purple potato and dry pea may produce healthy snack
  foods incorporating natural color along with positive effects on human health.
- Limited studies have been done on the effect of processing on formulations of potatoes
  and legumes or to characterize the phytochemical profiles of their mixes, and their
  contributions to antioxidant activities.
- Metabolism, absorption, and bioactivity of health-beneficial phytochemicals could
  be improved by combining protein and individual phytochemicals.
- Liu(9) reported that the additive and synergistic effects of biologically active
  compounds from fruits, vegetables, and whole grains are responsible for health benefits.
- The objective of this study was to investigate the complete phytochemical profiles
  that exist in free and bound forms, and their contribution to the total antioxidant
  activity in the raw ingredients (purple potato flour and dry pea flour), raw formulations,
  and extrusion cooked products prepared with the above ingredients.
- The bioactivity of phytochemicals in the raw and processed samples was also determined
  using the cellular antioxidant activity assay.
- (37) The cellular antioxidant activity assay has been used to assess antioxidants,
  foods, and dietary supplements due to its capability to consider cell uptake, distribution,
  and efficiency of protection against peroxyl radicals under physiological conditions.

- (30) and modified in our laboratory.
- (31, 32) Briefly, 400 μL of deionized water and 100 μL of a known dilution of the
  extract or standard solution were added to a test tube.
- Folin–Ciocalteu reagents (100 μL) was added to the solution and allowed to react
  for 6 min.
- Then, 1 mL of 7% sodium carbonate solution and 800 μL of deionized water were added
  to the test tubes, and the mixture was mixed well.
- The color developed for 90 min at room temperature, and absorbance was read at 760
  nm using a MRX II DYNEX spectrophotometer (Dynex Technologies, Inc., Chantilly,
  VA).
- The measurements for free, bound, and total phenolics were compared with a standard
  curve of prepared gallic acid solutions and expressed as micrograms of gallic acid
  equivalents (GAE) per gram dry weight (DW) sample ± SD for triplicate extracts.
- Chlorogenic, caffeic, _p_-coumaric, and ferulic acids in sample extracts were quantified
  using a reverse phase HPLC procedure employing a Supelcosil LC-18-DB, 150 mm × 4.6
  mm, 3 mm, column as reported previously.
- (33) Briefly, isocratic elution was conducted with 20% acetonitrile in water adjusted
  to pH 2 with trifluoroacetic acid, at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min, delivered using
  a Waters 515 HPLC pump (Waters Corp., Milford, MA).
- A Waters 2487 dual-wavelength absorbance detector was used for UV detection of analytes
  at 280 nm.
- Data signals were acquired and processed on a PC running Waters Millennium software,
  version 3.2 (1999).
- The retention times of the standards, chlorogenic, caffeic, _p_-coumaric, and ferulic
  acids, were 3.3, 4.7, 7.4, and 8.4 min, respectively.
- The phenolic acid concentrations of sample extracts were extrapolated from the pure
  phenolic acid standard curves (chlorogenic acid, _r_2 = 0.99; caffeic acid, _r_2
  = 0.99; _p_-coumaric acid, _r_2 = 0.99; and ferulic acid, _r_2 = 0.99).
- Twenty microliter injections were made in each run, and areas were used for all
  calculations.
- The selected individual peaks were identified by the retention times and co-injection
  of the pure standards.
- The method was validated by the recovery of chlorogenic acid.
- The percentage recovery for chlorogenic acid was 96.5 ± 6.22 (_n_ = 3).
- The total flavonoid contents of the samples were determined using the method of
  sodium borohydride/chloronil (SBC) total flavonoid assay with modifications.
- (34) The stored sample extracts for total phenolic analysis were thawed and added
  to test tubes (15 × 150 mm), then dried at 45 °C under nitrogen gas, and reconstituted
  in 1 mL of THF/EtOH (1:1, v/v).
- Catechin standards (0.3–10.0 mM) were prepared fresh each day before use in 1 mL
  of THF/EtOH (1:1, v/v).
- Each test tube with 1 mL of sample solution or 1 mL of catechin standard solution
  had 0.5 mL of 50 mM NaBH4 solution and 0.5 mL of 74.56 mM AlCl3 solution added and
  was then shaken in an orbital shaker (Laboratory-Line Instruments, Inc., Melrose
  Park, IL) for 30 min at room temperature.
- Then an additional 0.5 mL of NaBH4 solution was added to each test tube with continual
  shaking for another 30 min at room temperature.
- Cold acetic acid solution (2.0 mL of 0.8 M, 4 °C) was added to each test tube, and
  the solutions were shaken in an orbital shaker in the dark for 15 min after thorough
  mixing.
- Then, 1 mL of 20 mM chloranil was added to each tube, which was heated at 95 °C
  under shaking for 60 min in a reciprocal shaking bath (Precision Scientific Inc.,
  Chicago, IL).
- The temperature in the reciprocal shaking bath was maintained using glycerin.
- The reaction solutions were cooled using tap water, and the final volume was brought
  to 4 mL using methanol.
- Then, 1 mL of 1052 mM vanillin was added to each tube, followed by mixing.
- Concentrated HCl (2 mL of 12 M) was added to each tube, and the reaction solutions
  were kept in the dark for 15 min after thorough mixing.
- Aliquots of the final reaction solutions (200 μL) were added to each well of a 96-well
  plate after centrifuging for 3 min at 2500_g_, and absorbances were measured at
  490 nm using a MRX Microplate Reader with Revelation workstation (Dynex Technologies).
- Total flavonoids were expressed as micrograms of catechin equivalents per gram of
  dry weight sample.
- Data were reported as the mean ± SD for three replicates.
- The antioxidant activity of the samples (ingredients, raw formulations, and extruded
  products) were determined using the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) assay
  described by Prior et al.
- (35) and modified in our laboratory.
- (36) Briefly, 20 μL of blank, Trolox standard, or sample extracts in 75 mM potassium
  phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 (working buffer), was added to triplicate wells in a black,
  clear-bottom, 96-well microplate.
- The triplicate samples were distributed throughout the microplate and were not placed
  side-by-side, to avoid any effect on readings due to location.
- In addition, no outside wells were used, as use of those wells results in greater
  variation.
- A volume of 200 μL of 0.96 μM fluorescein in working buffer was added to each well
  and incubated at 37 °C for 20 min, with intermittent shaking, before addition of
  20 μL of freshly prepared 119 mM ABAP in working buffer using a 12-channel pipetter.
- The microplate was immediately inserted into a Fluoroskan Ascent FL plate reader
  (ThermoLabsystems) at 37 °C.
- The decay of fluorescence at 538 nm was measured with excitation at 485 nm every
  4.5 min for 2.5 h. The area under the fluorescence versus time curve for the samples
  minus the area under the curve for the blank were calculated and compared to a standard
  curve of the area under the curve for 6.25, 12.5, 25, and 50 μM Trolox standards
  minus the area under the curve for blank.
- ORAC values were expressed as mean micromoles of Trolox equivalents (TE) per gram
  of dry weight sample ± SD for triplicate data.
- The assay for CAA was performed following the procedures of Wolfe and Liu.
- (37) Briefly, HepG2 liver cancer cells from the passages of 5 and 7 were seeded
  at a density of 6 × 104 in 100 μL of complete growth medium per well on a 96-well
  microplate in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C.
- The wells on the boundary of the microplate were filled with 200 μL of PBS.
- Twenty-four hours after seeding, the growth medium was removed and the wells were
  washed with PBS.
- The wells were treated in triplicate with 100 μL of solutions containing different
  concentrations of antioxidant extracts plus 25 μM DCFH-DA dissolved in antioxidant
  treatment media for 1 h at 37 °C.
- Then treatment media were removed, and wells were washed with 100 μL of PBS to remove
  extracellular residues.
- One hundred microliters of 600 μM ABAP in oxidant treatment medium (HBSS) was applied
  to all of the cells, and the microplate was immediately placed into a Fluoroskan
  Ascent FL plate reader (ThermoLabsystems, Franklin, MA) at 37 °C.
- Emission was measured every 5 min for 1 h at 538 nm after excitement at 485 nm.
- The blank wells contained cells treated with DCFH-DA, HBSS, and antioxidant extracts
  without ABAP, whereas the control wells contained cells treated with DCFH-DA, HBSS,
  and ABAP without antioxidant extracts.
- The area under the curve for fluorescence (after subtraction of blank and initial
  fluorescence values) versus time was integrated to calculate the CAA value at each
  concentration of the sample extracts aswhere ∫SA is the integrated area under the
  sample fluorescence versus time curve and ∫CA is the integrated area from the control
  curve.
- The median effective dose (EC50), that is, the dose required to give a 50% inhibition
  for sample extract, was determined from the median effective plot of log(_f_a/_f_u)
  versus log(dose), where _f_a is the fraction affected (CAA unit) and _f_u is the
  fraction unaffected (1 – CAA unit) by the treatment.
- In the experiments, quercetin was used as a standard.
- All results were reported as the mean ± SD for at least three analyses for each
  type of extraction, and each extract was analyzed in triplicate.
- Results were subjected to ANOVA, and significance differences between means were
  determined using Tukey’s multiple-comparison test run on SAS (version 9.1, SAS Institute
  Inc., Cary, NC).
- Correlations among various parameters were also evaluated using Pearson’s correlation
  coefficient.

  of their raw formulations (424.2 ± 344 and 195.8 ± 10 mg/mL, respectively).
- However, no significant difference in the EC50 values was observed between the raw
  (77.8 ± 19 mg/mL) and extruded products (70.3 ± 4.4 mg/mL) prepared from 65% PPF.
- Similarly, the CAA values of 35, 50, and 65% PPF raw formulations (0.017 ± 0.018,
  0.025 ± 0.001, and 0.06 ± 0.015 μmol QE/g DW sample, respectively) and extruded
  products (0.56 ± 0.008, 0.128 ± 0.023, and 0.063 ± 0.004 μmol QE/g DW sample, respectively)
  followed the same trend as their EC50 values.
- The EC50 values of quercetin standard in all of the replicates were in the range
  of 3.35–4.5 mg/mL, which were similar to those reported by Wolfe and Liu.

- Cellular antioxidant activity (CAA) and EC50 value of ingredients, raw formulations,
  and extruded products prepared from purple potato flour (PPF) and dry pea flour
  (DPF) formulations.
- The selected formulations for preparing extrudates contained _x_% of PPF and (100
  – _x_)% of DPF.
- Bars with different lower case letters are significantly different (_p_ &lt; 0.05)
  for CAA, whereas different upper case letters are significantly different (_p_ &lt;
  0.05) for EC50.
- Relationships among total phenolics, total ORAC values, and CAA with individual
  phenolic acids and flavonoids in free and bound forms were determined using Pearson’s
  correlation coefficient (Table 3).
- The free phenolic content was significantly correlated (_p_ &lt; 0.05) to total
  ORAC values (_r_2 = 0.98) and CAA values (_r_2 = 0.66).
- Similar correlation patterns were observed between total phenolics and total ORAC
  values and CAA values.
- The free and total flavonoids were significantly correlated (_p_ &lt; 0.05) to total
  phenolics, ORAC, and CAA values.
- Among individual phenolic acids, free and total chlorogenic acid contents were significantly
  correlated (_p_ &lt; 0.05) to the total phenolics, ORAC, and CAA values.
- _p_-Coumaric and ferulic acids in the bound and total extracts significantly correlated
  (_p_ &lt; 0.05) to the total phenolics, ORAC, and CAA values.
- However, caffeic acid did not show any positive correlation with the total phenolics,
  ORAC, or CAA values.
- The total ORAC values were significantly correlated (_p_ &lt; 0.05) with CAA values
  (_r_2 = 0.69).
- Table 3.
- "Correlation Analysis of Phenolics, Antioxidant Activity (ORAC), and Cellular Antioxidant
  Activity (CAA) of Ingredients (Purple Potato Flour and Dry Pea Flour), Raw Formulations,a
  and Extruded Productb  \n\n\n\nThe formulations contain _x_% of purple potato flour
  (PPF) and (100 – _x_)% of dry pea flour (DPF)."
- Extruded products prepared from PPF and DPF formulations.
- Correlation coefficients were calculated as _r_2.
- Significant levels are given in the parentheses.
- Phytochemicals in food samples are present in both free and bound forms.
- (11, 12) Without accounting for bound phytochemicals, the total phytochemical content
  will be underestimated.
- (11) Therefore, studying free and bound phytochemicals provides a more accurate
  information on total phytochemicals and the contributions of free, soluble-conjugated,
  and bound to the total phenolics and their total antioxidant activity.
- The cellular antioxidant activity assay, used in this study, is a biologically relevant
  means to quantify the bioactivity of antioxidants in food products as it takes into
  consideration the cellular uptake, metabolism, and distribution of bioactive compounds
  in the cell.
- (37, 38) The values of cellular antioxidant activities of the samples were also
  evaluated using ORAC.
- This study was designed to determine the phytochemicals, their relationships, and
  contributions to total antioxidant activity in potato and dry pea flours, raw formulations,
  and extrusion cooked snack foods made from the raw formulations.
- Our study showed that majority of the phenolics in PPF and DPF were present in free
  rather than in bound form (Table 1).
- The quantity of total phenolics in whole potato cultivars grown in the Andes Mountains
  of South America was in the range of 1120 − 12370 μg GAE/g DW sample, which is within
  the range of our study determined on flesh potato flour.
- (39) Results from a Colorado potato breeding program have shown that there was no
  difference in the total phenolic content between whole ‘Purple Majesty’ potato processed
  thru microwave cooking, boiling or baking compared to the unprocessed potatoes.
- In our study (Figure 1) we determined that the extrudates obtained from flesh potato
  flour had higher concentration in total phenolics than raw formulations.
- This indicates that the type of cooking/processing have a significant effect on
  the phenolic content in the final product.
- Additionally, the type of potato cultivar may had also an effect on the reported
  result.
- (19) The percentage contribution of free phenolics to the total was 68%, whereas
  bound phenolics contributed 32% in potato flour (Table 1).
- This is similar to the results of Chu et al.,(40) who reported the contributions
  of 60 and 40% by free and bound phenolics, respectively, to the total phenolics
  in white potatoes with skin.
- (40) Therefore, the total phenolic contents reported in the previous literature
  may have been underestimated by not including the bound phenolics in the results
  of their study.
- Bound phenolics might be associated with the plant cell walls that survive upper
  gastrointestinal digestion and reach the colon, where most of them are released
  by intestinal microflora.
- (11, 12) The total phenolic content in DPF in the present study (Figure 1) was 3–5-fold
  lower than in the reported literature.
- (25, 26) This could be due to (i) use of previously milled flours compared to whole
  raw legumes by other researchers or (ii) different solvents for extraction of phenolic
  compounds.
- (41) Free phenolics in DPF contributed more (87%) to the total phenolics than bound
  ones (13%).
- The raw formulations from potato and dry pea flours in selected concentrations had
  69–84% free phenolics.
- Extrusion cooking of raw formulations increased the percentage contributions of
  free phenolics to the total and decreased the contributions from bound phenolics
  (Table 1).
- Increase in the total phenolics in the extruded food products (50–60%) rather than
  the raw formulations could be due to (i) breaking of conjugated phenolics into free
  phenolics and (ii) leaching of soluble fibers, proteins, and other nonphenolic soluble
  components such as mono-, di-, and oligosaccharides.
- (26) Han and Baik(26) reported a similar increase in the total phenolics of cooked
  and soaked chickpeas, yellow peas, green peas, and soybeans.
- However, in another paper, the total phenolics of cooked legumes were significantly
  reduced (_p_ &lt; 0.05) when compared to uncooked samples.
- '(25)


  Free and bound phytochemicals in potato flour contributed 64 and 36%, respectively,
  to the total ORAC antioxidant activity, similar to their contributions to the total
  phenolics.'
- The total ORAC value in potato flour was in the range of hydrophilic ORAC values
  (28.25–250.67 μmol TE/g DW) of Andean potato cultivars.
- (39) The individual ORAC values of free and bound phytochemicals could not be compared
  due to limited information in the literature.
- The total ORAC value in DPF was comparable to that of reported in the literature(42)
  and had similar contributions from free (86%) and bound (14%) phytochemicals as
  was the case for total phenolics (Table 1).
- Han and Baik(26) reported that free and bound phytochemicals contributed 68 and
  32%, respectively, to the total TEAC antioxidant activity of yellow peas.
- Processing of the all raw formulations using extrusion cooking significantly increased
  (_p_ &lt; 0.05) the total ORAC values of the extruded products.
- Increase in the total ORAC values followed the same pattern as in total phenolics
  of the extruded products.
- It was also observed that the ORAC values of bound phytochemicals significantly
  decreased (_p_ &lt; 0.05) and ORAC values of free phytochemicals increased in the
  extruded products.
- This phenomenon could be attributed to (i) breaking of conjugated phytochemicals
  to release free phytochemicals,(31) (ii) prevention of enzymatic oxidation, and
  (iii) darker colors of the extruded products indicating formation of Maillard reaction
  products having antioxidant properties.
- (43) The ORAC values of processed green peas, yellow peas, and chickpeas were significantly
  increased (_p_ &lt; 0.05) (27–114, 12–67, and 25–40%, respectively) after pressure
  boiling as compared to the raw legumes.
- (42) However, the FRAP values and DPPH antioxidant activity of legumes were decreased
  significantly (_p_ &lt; 0.05) by conventional and pressure boiling.
- (25, 42) Increases in the antioxidant activities of sweet corn, teas, and tomatoes
  with thermal processing were also reported.
- '(4, 31, 44)


  Quantities of free flavonoids in potato and dry pea flours were significantly higher
  (_p_ &lt; 0.05) when compared to their bound flavonoids.'
- The total flavonoids of both flours followed a similar pattern as free flavonoids,
  because of the larger contribution from free flavonoids (Table 1).
- As we previously stated, other authors have also indicated that there is limited
  literature available to compare free, bound, and total flavonoids in colored potatoes.
- (45) The total flavonoids of DPF in our study were higher when compared to the reported
  total flavonoid contents of whole(41, 46) and dehulled yellow peas.
- (47) Quantities of free flavonoids increased after extrusion cooking of all the
  raw formulations.
- Interestingly, the contents of bound flavonoids were also significantly increased
  (_p_ &lt; 0.05) in the extruded products when compared to their raw formulations.
- Choi et al.
- (48) reported a significant increase of free flavonoids in shiitake mushrooms after
  heat treatment at 100 and 121 °C when compared to raw mushrooms.
- However, the investigators observed decreases in bound flavonoids after heat treatment.
- Increase in the flavonoid contents of the extrudates could be attributed to (i)
  disruption of plant cell walls providing better extractability, (ii) breaking of
  chemical bonds of higher molecular weight polyphenols and forming soluble low molecular
  weight polyphenol compounds, and (iii) interconversion of flavonoids in different
  forms.
- (49) Variyar et al.
- (50) reported an increase in antioxidant potential of soybeans with the dose of
  γ-irradiation due to increased levels of genistin (an isoflavone) and degradation
  products of diadzein.
- Phenolic acids are sources of dietary phenols, which are linked to cellulose, lignin,
  and proteins through ester bonds.
- For example, chlorogenic acid has strong antioxidant activity and is already demonstrated
  to have several desirable effects on biochemical processes involved in carcinogenesis.
- (51)_p_-Coumaric acid was the major phenolic acid observed in potato flour, followed
  by chlorogenic, caffeic, and ferulic acids (Table 2).
- Most of the _p_-coumaric and caffeic acids were observed in bound phenolic fraction,
  whereas chlorogenic acid was higher in free phenolics.
- Ferulic acid was observed only in bound phenolics.
- Adom and Liu reported that &gt;93% of ferulic acids were present in the bound form
  in corn, wheat, oats, and rice.
- (11) The content of free chlorogenic acid we reported in this study was similar
  to the total chlorogenic content in ‘Purple Majesty’ potatoes found in a Colorado
  potato breeding program.
- (19) Interestingly, our results demonstrated that bound phenolics contributed additional
  ∼20% of total chlorogenic acid, which was commonly underestimated in published literature.
- Lewis et al.
- (52) and Lachman et al.
- (53) reported in detail the presence of chlorogenic, caffeic, _p_-coumaric, ferulic,
  and other phenolic acids in colored potatoes.
- Chlorogenic acid, followed by ferulic and caffeic acids, was detected mostly in
  bound phenolics of DPF, whereas _p_-coumaric acid was not detected.
- Dry pea flour contained only chlorogenic acid in free phenolic fraction.
- The content of total chlorogenic acid in this study was higher when compared to
  the reported content of whole yellow peas.
- (25) The investigators, however, reported having _p_-coumaric acid along with chlorogenic
  and gallic acids in yellow peas.
- A multifold increase in chlorogenic acid in free and bound phenolic fractions of
  the formulations rather than raw ingredients could be due to the binding of an _o_-hydroxy
  phenolic group in chlorogenic acid to protein via the bidentate hydrogen bond.
- (54) The mechanism for binding of chlorogenic acid to sunflower proteins involved
  both hydrogen bonding and covalent linkages between oxidized phenolics and nucleophilic
  amino acid side chains, such as lysine and cysteine.
- (55) The behavior of caffeic acid in the raw formulations could also be due to the
  same mechanism of protein-bound phenolic interactions as chlorogenic acid.
- Quantities of chlorogenic acids in free and bound phenolics in all the extruded
  products were significantly higher (_p_ &lt; 0.05) when compared to their raw formulations
  (Table 2).
- A similar pattern was observed in total chlorogenic acid contents of the extruded
  products.
- Xu and Chang(25) reported significant increases in gallic, chlorogenic, and total
  phenolic acids in yellow peas after pressure boiling.
- Significant decreases in caffeic acid in bound fraction and total phenolics were
  observed in the extruded products when compared to their raw formulations, whereas
  those decreases were not detected in free phenolics.
- A decrease in caffeic acid contents with exposure of potato strips to home processing
  conditions was reported.
- (56) Total _p_-coumaric and ferulic acid contents were increased in the extruded
  products compared to their raw formulations, mostly due to increases in their bound
  phenolics.
- However, caffeic, _p_-coumaric, and ferulic acids were not detected in free phenolic
  extractions of the extruded products.
- The undetected phenolic acids in the extrudates may be due to alkaline hydrolysis
  that partly or completely broke down original phenolic acids.
- Increases in the total chlorogenic, _p_-coumaric, and ferulic contents in the extruded
  products could be attributed to the alkaline hydrolysis of caffeic acid present
  in conjugated phenolics.
- The reasons for change in the individual phenolic acids during extrusion cooking
  could be explained according to Fleuriet and Macheix(57) as (i) oxidative degradation
  of phenolic acids, (ii) breakdown of conjugated phenolics and release of free phenolic
  acids, and (iii) formation of complex phenolic acids.
- Increases in the contents of chlorogenic, _p_-coumaric, and ferulic acids and low
  molecular phenolic acids from the breakdown of caffeic acid could have increased
  the total phenolics in the extruded products.
- Thermal decomposition of caffeic acid generated compounds such as tetraoxygenated
  phenylinadan isomers with higher antioxidant activity than caffeic acid.
- (58) Analysis of individual phenolic acids suggested that the breakdown of higher
  polyphenols and formation of novel compounds after processing could have increased
  the total phenolics as well as antioxidant activity.
- Significant positive correlations among individual phenolic acids except caffeic
  acid to the total phenolics and total ORAC antioxidant activity justify these assumptions.
- Increases in the total phenolics after processing and a strong correlation (_r_2
  = 0.9847) with ORAC antioxidant activity showed that phenolics were mostly responsible
  for the chemical antioxidant activity in the extruded products.
- The bioactivity of phytochemicals in free phytochemical extracts in the ingredients,
  raw formulations, and extruded products was studied using the CAA assay.
- Potato flour showed potent CAA with an EC50 of 52 mg/mL.
- Lower EC50 values indicate higher CAA.
- Dry pea flour had no measurable CAA.
- CAA were observed in all of the raw formulations and their extruded products (Figure
  4).
- The extruded products prepared from 50% PPF had higher CAA and lower EC50 value
  among the extrudates (_p_ &lt; 0.05) and also had much higher CAA (_p_ &lt; 0.05)
  and lower EC50 value (_p_ &lt; 0.05) than its raw formulation.
- The effect of extrusion on the products prepared from 65% PPF was not significantly
  different (_p_ &gt; 0.05) in EC50 or CAA values.
- Similar results were observed in the 35% PPF raw formulation; CAA values were increased
  in the extrudates when compared to its raw formulation (Figure 4).
- There was no specific pattern observed in EC50 values of the extruded products.
- It could be possible that products extruded from a 50% PPF raw formulation had a
  better composition of potato and dry pea flour for possible additive and synergistic
  effects of phytochemicals responsible for the higher CAA as suggested by Liu.
- (9) The CAA value of the extruded product from 50% PPF formulation was comparable
  with those of plums and red grapes and higher than those of cherries, kiwifruit,
  mangoes, peaches, and pears.
- (36) The extruded products had higher CAA when compared to the raw formulations,
  which may be due to extrusion processing increasing the amount of bioaccessible
  phytochemicals as well as increased cellular uptake of those phytochemicals.
- In summary, a comprehensive study on the contributions of free and bound phytochemicals
  to the total phenolics, flavonoids, ORAC antioxidant activity, and CAA in ‘Purple
  Majesty’ potato and dry pea flours is presented in this study.
- Raw formulations of PPF and DPF and their extrudates were analyzed in detail with
  regard to changes in individual phenolic acids, bound and free phytochemicals, and
  their contributions to ORAC antioxidant activities after extrusion processing.
- In most of the extruded products, the total phenolics, flavonoids, and ORAC values
  increased after processing.
- The CAA were observed in potato flour, raw formulations, and extruded products.
- Extrusion processing improved CAA of 50% PPF raw formulation.
- Measuring the antioxidant activity using the CAA assay in the extruded food products
  is important for assessing the bioactivity of processed foods, because it is more
  biologically relevant than chemical antioxidant assays.
- (37) Further studies on the antioxidant activities of individual phytochemicals
  and changes during processing are needed to understand the detailed mechanism of
  the breakage and formation of total phytochemicals and their contribution to bioactivity.
