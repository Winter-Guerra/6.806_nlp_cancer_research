- Later menopause is a risk factor for breast and endometrial cancer, yet few studies
  have investigated dietary predictors of this potentially modifiable event.
- In particular, dairy contains hormones and growth factors that could potentially
  impact menopausal timing.
- We therefore assessed the association between regular consumption of dairy foods
  and related nutrients and age at natural menopause.
- We conducted a prospective analysis with up to 20 y of follow-up in 46,059 participants
  in the Nurses’ Health Study who were premenopausal in 1980.
- We observed 30,816 events of natural menopause over 401,754 person-years.
- In the total population, the estimated mean age at natural menopause was 51.5 y
  for women who consumed no low-fat dairy and 51.5, 51.6, 51.7, and 51.8 y for women
  who consumed 0.1–1.0, 1.1–2.0, 2.1–3.0, and &gt;3 servings of low-fat dairy daily,
  respectively.
- 'Premenopausal women &lt;51 y of age consuming &gt;3 servings of low-fat dairy per
  day were 14% less likely (HR: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.77, 0.96; _P_-trend &lt; 0.0001) to
  report natural menopause in the next month relative to those consuming 0.1–1 servings/d.'
- 'Similar results were obtained for skim milk (for &gt;6 servings/wk vs. 0–1 servings/mo:
  HR: 0.93; 95% CI: 0.89, 0.97; _P_-trend &lt; 0.0001) but not for total high-fat
  dairy or whole milk.'
- Dairy foods were not associated with age at menopause among women ≥51 y of age.
- These findings support the growing body of literature on the hormonally active nature
  of milk and dairy foods.
