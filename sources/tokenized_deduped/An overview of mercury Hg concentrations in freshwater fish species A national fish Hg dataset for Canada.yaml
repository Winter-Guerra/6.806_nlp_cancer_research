- Fish mercury (Hg) concentrations have been measured over the last 30â€“40 years in
  all regions of Canada as part of various monitoring and research programs.
- Despite this large amount of data, only regional assessments of fish Hg trends and
  patterns have previously been attempted.
- The objective of this study was to assemble available freshwater fish Hg concentration
  data from all provinces and territories and identify national patterns.
- The Canadian Fish Mercury Database includes over 330 000 records representing 104
  species of freshwater fish collected from over 5000 locations across Canada between
  1967 and 2010.
- Analysis of the 28 most frequently occurring species (&gt;1000 records) showed that
  the majority of variation in Hg concentrations (when normalized to a standard size)
  was accounted for by geographic location.
- Median Hg concentrations increased with trophic level (_r_ = 0.40, _p_ &lt; 0.05),
  with the highest Hg concentrations found in piscivorous species such as walleye
  (_Sander vitreus_), northern pike (_Esox lucius_), and lake trout (_Salvelinus namaycush_).
- The Canadian Fish Mercury Database provides the most comprehensive summary of fish
  Hg measurements in Canada, and the results indicate that several regionally observed
  trends in fish Hg concentrations (e.g., Hg biomagnification and geographic variation)
  are observed at a national scale.
- Implications for the effective assessment of changes in fish Hg concentrations in
  relation to changes in Hg emission regulations are discussed.
