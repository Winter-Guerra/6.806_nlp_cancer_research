- Aberrant glycosylation occurs in essentially all types of human cancers.
- A difference in glycopattern of proteins will result in a change of function of
  the proteins.
- The lectin from _Helix pomatia_ (HPA) recognizes N-acetylgalactosaminylated glycoproteins
  and very consistent results over the increased binding of HPA in tissue sections
  are associated with metastasis progression and poor patient prognosis in a range
  of human adenocarcinomas.
- The induced modification of protein function after changed glycosylation is unknown,
  and as a part in characterizing the glycoproteins carrying the specific carbohydrates,
  we analyzed the major HPA binding proteins in sera from healthy women, women with
  primary breast cancer with no metastasis (bcmet−), and women with metastasizing
  breast cancer (bcmet+) using lectin affinity chromatography and lectin blotting.
- The binding ligands were further identified using mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS)
  to confirm the captured glycoproteins.
- The major HPA binding proteins in serum were found to be IgA1, complement factor
  C3, von Willebrand factor (vWF), alpha-2-macroglobulin and IgM.
- This set of antigens is a panel of candidates for useful HPA related biomarkers
  in sera, but our results also emphasize the fact that the blood group phenotypes
  are of most importance when using the lectin HPA in recognition of cancer biomarkers
  in sera and plasma.
- The results emphasize that interpretation of an individual change in the glycosylation
  pattern of a specific tumor marker always needs to be analyzed in its right context.
- This study shows that the blood group phenotypes can have a major impact on the
  results when analyzing HPA lectin binding.

  Glycosylation is one of the most common post-translational modifications of proteins
  and approximately 50% of all plasma proteins are glycosylated.'
- (1) The modification affects the folding, stability and biological function of the
  proteins.
- (2) It has even been suggested that glycosylation could block phosphorylation and
  thus be directly involved in activation and regulation of signaling pathways.
- (3) The lectin from _Helix pomatia_ (HPA) recognizes N- acetylgalactosaminylated
  glycoproteins and has on several occasions been reported to be associated with metastasis
  behavior and bad prognosis of breast cancer, melanoma and other carcinomas.

  For several years, oncologists have sought to identify serum markers that would
  reveal the presence of specific cancers to be used for prognosis, monitoring drug
  effects and defining treatment options.'
- In consequence of the high complexity and the high dynamic range in sera, efforts
  are made to remove high-abundance proteins like albumin and immunoglobulins, which
  are 10 orders of magnitude greater than the low-abundance proteins.
- The depletion of high-abundance proteins can be made using adsorption of immobilized
  dyes,(6) immunoaffinity extraction (7) or with commercial antibody based kits.
- Another approach has been the enrichment of certain glycoproteins using lectin affinity
  chromatography.
- '(8-12)


  In this study, serum from healthy women, women with breast cancer, bcmet− and bcmet+,
  were characterized by the lectin HPA.'
- Glycoproteins were detected either by using lectin-blotting or enriching by using
  lectin affinity chromatography and separated using one-dimensional gel electrophoresis
  (1D-PAGE) followed by identification using MALDI-TOF MS.
- The HPA recognizes a heterogeneous range of glycoconjugates, including, among others,
  glycoproteins bearing the Tn epitope (_N_-acetylgalactosamine-O-Ser/Thr) and blood
  group A antigens.
- Therefore, sera from most of the individuals with A and AB phenotype revealed a
  more intense staining pattern than individuals with O and B phenotype.
- As expected, the procedure showed differences between patients with different blood
  groups, stressing the facts that both secretor status and blood group is essential
  in the background information when screening for biomarkers.
- Far Western blot analysis of 1D-PAGE separated sera indicated differences between
  individual sera that were not possible to detect in the affinity purified material
  indicating a difference in sensitivity and/or specificity between the different
  methods.
- The intensity of staining between individual bands in far Western blot also indicated
  far Western blot to be more of a quantitative method for determination of HPA binding
  compared to the affinity procedure.
- The HPA affinity chromatography combined with 1D-PAGE followed by matrix-assisted
  laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) increased
  the sensitivity of the screening, avoiding the presence of major serum proteins
  and easily identifying known glycoproteins in sera.
- Major bands in sera after HPA affinity chromatography appear to be IgA1, C3, alpha
  2 macroglobulin, vWF and IgM.
- A total of 47 serum samples were collected from postmenopausal women under controlled
  conditions at the University Hospital in Lund.
- All samples were processed after collection for a maximum of 2 h prior to freezing
  at −80 °C.
- The study was based on samples from 16 healthy women (median age of 55.7, range
  47−60), 16 patients with bcmet− (median age of 60.7, range 53−67), and 15 patient
  with bcmet+ (median age of 60.4, range 52−74).
- The blood group phenotypes were known for all the women with breast cancer, but
  some of the healthy women did not know their blood group phenotype.
- The study was approved by the Lund University research ethics committee.
- The HPA-agarose (EY Laboratories, Inc., San Mateo, CA), 100 μL gel, was loaded into
  a Spin Filter column 0.22 μM Cellulose Acetate (Agilent Technologies) and equilibrated
  with 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 150 mM NaCl.
- Serum, 100 μL, was loaded to the column in a total volume of 0.5 mL for 2 h in 10

- The beads were washed 10 times with 0.5 mL of 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl,
  and 0.1% NP40.
- The beads were then mixed with 100 μL of 0.1 M _N_-acetyl galactosamine in 10 mM
  Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 150 mM for 30 min to release glycoproteins adsorbed onto the
  beads.
- This step was repeated once.
- The eluted fractions were subjected to acetone precipitation; 800 μL of ice-cold
  100% acetone was added to the 200 μL fraction, incubated on ice for 15 min, and
  centrifuged at 10 000_g_ for 30 min.
- The supernatant was removed and the pellets were allowed to air-dry.
- The pellets were dissolved in 40 μL of SDS-sample buffer pH 8.5 (247 mM Tris, 2%
  SDS, 0.51 mM EDTA, 16.5 mM DTT, 10% glycerol, 0.025% (w/v) bromophenol blue).
- Whole sera was diluted 1/10 in distilled water and 5 μL was mixed with 5 μL 2× SDS-sample
  buffer and heated at 60 °C for 10 min.
- The samples were allowed to cool and 5 μL of 0.5 M iodoacetamide was added.
- The samples were applied onto Criterion XT Precast Gel 4−12% Bis-Tris (13.3 × 8.7
  × 0.1 cm, BioRad) and the separation was carried out using Criterion gel-apparatus
  (BioRad) at 200 V for 60 min using MOPS as running buffer.
- Twenty-five microliters of the enriched glycoprotein from sera were heated and iodoacetamide
  was added as above.
- The gel electrophoresis was performed using precasted 4−12% NuPAGE (8 × 8 cm × 0.1
  cm, Invitrogen).
- Electrophoresis was carried out in an XCell Mini-cell apparatus (Invitrogen) at
  200 V for 40 min using MOPS as running buffer.
- The gels were either stained with silver(13) or transferred to PVDF membrane.
- After electrophoresis, the gel was soaked in blotting buffer (25 mM Tris-Base, 193
  mM glycine and 20% ethanol) for 15 min and then transferred onto PVDF membrane (Invitrogen)
  for 1 h at constant voltage of 30 V. The membrane was either stained with 0.1% R-350
  Coomassie Brilliant Blue in 50% methanol for 5 min and destained with 50% methanol,
  10% acetic acid or incubated with biotin conjugated lectin.
- The membrane was blocked in 1% bovine serum albumin in TTBS (20 mM Tris, 150 mM
  NaCl, 0.2% Tween 20, pH 7.5) overnight at 4 °C.
- The membrane was incubated with biotinylated HPA (5 μg/mL) in 1% BSA in TTBS for
  3 h at room temperature.
- The membrane was then washed briefly twice and followed by 3 × 5 min washes in TTBS.
- The membrane was incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated streptavidin
  (GE HealthCare) diluted 1:2000 in 1% BSA in TTBS for 1 h followed by two brief washes
  and 3 × 5 min washes.
- The membrane was developed using autoradiography film and the enhanced chemiluminescence
  (ECL) system (Amersham Bioscience).
- The bands of interest were cut out from the PVDF membrane which had been stained
  with Coomassie.
- The membrane pieces were washed with 0.5 mL of Milli-Q water for 30 min followed
  by four washes of 0.5 mL of 40% acetonitrile (ACN) in 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate
  for 20 min each until the Coomassie stain was removed.
- Then, the membranes were washed with 0.5 mL of Milli-Q water for 30 min and blocked
  with 0.5% PVP-40 in 100 mM acetic acid for 30 min at 37 °C.
- The membranes were washed 5 × 0.5 mL Milli-Q followed by two washes with 50 mM ammonium
  bicarbonate.
- Proteins were degraded into characteristic fragments with trypsin (sequencing grade,
  Promega) in 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate overnight at 37 °C.
- Digestion was terminated by addition of 20 μL of 2% trifluoroacetic acid, which
  also extracted the peptides from the membrane.
- After 2 h at room temperature, the peptides were purified from the digestion buffer
  using C18 Ziptips (Millipore).
- Briefly, the solid phase was conditioned using 2 × 10 μL 50% ACN, 0.1% TFA in Milli-Q
  water.
- The organic solvent was washed away by two washes of 10 μL of 0.1% TFA.
- The samples were aspirated and dispensed 30 times followed by two washes of 0.1%
  TFA to remove salts and unbound material.
- The purified peptides were eluted directly onto the sample target (Anchorchip target,
  Bruker Daltonik) where 0.7 μL of matrix, 2.5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (3 mg/mL in 30%
  ACN) had been added.
- The MALDI-TOF MS instrument was a Bruker Reflex III instrument (Bruker Daltonik,
  Bremen).
- The instrument was equipped with a delayed extraction ion source, utilizing a nitrogen
  laser at 337 nm and was operated in reflector mode at an accelerating voltage of
  20 kV.
- A total of 160−210 single shot spectra were accumulated from each sample.

  1; peptide mass tolerance, ±0.1 Da; fixed modification, carbamidomethyl (C); variable
  modification, none.
- Sera, 0.5 μL, from 16 healthy women, 16 bcmet+ and 15 bcmet− were separated using
  1D-PAGE followed by far Western blot.
- The sera from different women with breast cancer and healthy women displayed marked
  differences in HPA-binding characteristics (Figure 1).
- Individual patterns seemed to correlate with patient ABO blood group, but individual
  differences were also seen for example H5, H9 and H10.
- Figure 1.
- Whole sera (0.5 μL), from healthy women (H1−16), bcmet+ (M1−14, 16) and bcmet− (N1−16),

- Phenotypes of blood group listed above the figure.
- Glycoproteins were enriched using lectin affinity chromatography from different
  blood groups phenotypes.
- The proteins were separated using 1D-PAGE and then transferred to PVDF membrane.
- The membrane was stained with Coomassie.
- The enriched glycoproteins pattern (Figure 2) showed high similarities between individuals
  with the same ABO blood group regardless of disease status.
- Blood group 0 and B had equal pattern which differed from the pattern of AB.
- Figure 2.
- Affinity chromatography enriched glycoproteins, separated by 1D-PAGE and transferred

- The protein pattern was visualized using Coomassie staining.
- Lanes 1−3, healthy women; lanes 4−5, bcmet+; and lanes 7−9, bcmet−.
- Phenotypes of blood group listed above the figure.
- According to the blood group phenotypes, a selection was made using only women with
  blood group 0+ to reduce the pattern inconsequently of the blood group phenotype.
- Three serum samples from each group, healthy women, bcmet+ and bcmet−, were applied
  to lectin affinity chromatography for enrichment of glycoproteins.
- After enrichment, proteins were separated using 1D-PAGE and stained with silver
  (Figure 3A).
- A small fraction of the enriched glycoproteins equivalent to 5 μL of serum were
  subjected to far Western blot staining with biotinylated-HPA (Figure 3B).
- No remarkably differences were seen between women with breast cancer and healthy
  women neither in the protein pattern nor in the HPA-staining pattern.
- Figure 3.
- Affinity chromatography enriched glycoproteins separated by 1D-PAGE from sera of
  blood group O phenotype.
- The protein pattern was visualized by silver staining (A) and the glycoprotein pattern
  with HPA-staining (B).
- Lanes 1−3, healthy women; lanes 4 and 5, bcmet+; and lanes 7−9, bcmet−.
- The same experiment was also performed using only women with blood group A.
- The separated proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes and stained with Coomassie
  (Figure 4A) and with biotinylated-HPA (Figure 4B).
- Both the protein and the HPA-binding pattern were almost the same with minor differences
  seen; however, there was no discrepancy between the three groups.
- Figure 4.
- Affinity chromatography enriched glycoproteins, separated by 1D-PAGE and transferred
  to PVDF membrane, from sera of blood group A phenotype.
- The protein pattern was visualized using Coomassie staining (A) and the glycoprotein
  pattern with HPA-staining (B).
- Lanes 1−3, healthy women; lanes 4 and 5, bcmet+; and lanes 7−9, bcmet−.
- Affinity chromatography enriched glycoproteins from women with blood group A were
  identified from the Coomassie stained PVDF membrane.
- Some of the sera (M4, N1, N4, N7, H12, H14, H15, M10, N11, N13 and N14) had an intense
  low molecular double band in the 50 kDa region (Figure 1).
- All those samples were from women with blood group A or AB.
- These bands could not be observed in the affinity enriched samples from the same
  women (H14, H15 and M4) (Figure 4).
- In all sera tested in Figure 2, there is an increase in the number of bands compared
  to the far Western blot experiment, (all O, B or AB sera) indicating a larger sensitivity
  of the affinity technique compared to far Western blot.
- In a similar way, Figures 3 and 4 also show an increase in the number of HPA binding
  proteins with molecular weight above the IgA1 heavy chain (apparent MW of 55 kDa).
- The weak stain of M1 in Figure 1 is partly repeated in Figure 4, but the variation
  in intensity of the far Western blot pattern in Figure 1 is partly lost in the pattern
  of the affinity purified glycoproteins.
- HPA has been extensively used in cancer research as an indication of poor patient
  prognosis.
- There are convincing data showing the correlation between the formation of lymph
  node metastasis and the binding of HPA in breast cancer.
- (14, 15) High binding of HPA reflects the increased expression of a heterogeneous
  range of O-linked _N_-acetylglucosamine (GalNAc) proteins including among others
  also the blood group A antigen and the Tn antigen, and is a consequence of changes
  in the expression range of glycotransferases(16) or an elevated increase Golgi pH
  leading to a redistribution of the glycotransferases in the Golgi apparatus.

  In this study, we investigated the expression of HPA-binding proteins in sera from
  healthy women, bcmet− and bcmet+.'
- When whole sera were analyzed for HPA-binding by protein separation using 1D-PAGE
  followed by far Western blot, marked differences in HPA-binding pattern were obtained
  (Figure 1).
- The HPA-binding seemed to correlate with the ABO blood groups.
- The HPA-binding was more intensive for individuals with blood group A and AB, which
  reflects the fact that HPA apart from binding GalNAc also binds to the blood group
  A antigen.
- There were also interindividual differences for individuals belonging to the same
  blood group in the HPA-binding, irrespective of disease state.
- However, suppose that we at this stage had pooled our samples (pooling H1−8, M1−8
  and N1−8, from Figure 1).
- Pooling of samples is a common procedure for reducing the time and costs of analysis.
- In this special case, the result would have been totally misleading, showing that
  women with breast cancer had a more intensive HPA-binding pattern compared to healthy
  women, as a consequence of the fact that HPA recognizes the blood group A antigen
  and the majority of the healthy group belonged to blood group O and the majority
  of the cases belonged to A and AB in the disease groups.
- The interindividual differences from sera from women with the same blood group were
  less pronounced after the glycoproteins had been enriched using HPA-affinity chromatography.
- Minor differences in the patterns were seen between the women, but no evident differences
  between the disease state and healthy women (Figures 2−4).
- This could be a consequence of the limited resolving power of protein separation
  using 1D-PAGE.
- However, a major difference was observed comparing the whole sera stained by biotinylated-HPA
  (Figure 1) and the enriched glycoproteins (Figure 2−4).
- The whole sera showed a larger variation in the HPA-staining between the different
  blood group phenotypes than the enriched glycoproteins did.
- An explanation could be that the affinity chromatography steps drastically reduce
  albumin level in the sample and that the more diluted glycoproteins are concentrated
  and the glycoproteins become more apparent on the 1D-PAGE.
- Some protein bands are seen on the blots with whole sera in the mass range of 37−50
  kDa (Figure 1) but are missing after the enrichment (Figure 2−4).
- This phenomenon could be explained by low binding to these antigens in solution
  or to a different binding specificity for the reagents, biotinylated-HPA versus
  HPA-agarose.
- The lectin has also more than one binding site and the avidity gain in multiple
  binding points to a narrow concentrated antigen band in the blot is advantageous
  compared to affinity for the antigen in solution.
- In this study, HPA-binding glycoproteins in sera were identified as IgA1, Alpha-2-macroglobulin,
  complement C3, ig mu heavy chain disease protein (MUCB), Ig mu chain C region (MUC),
  von Willebrand factor, and serrotransferrin.
- IgA1 has been found to bind to HPA in breast cancer tissue.
- (12) IgA has also been reported to be increased in breast carcinoma patients and
  the presence in tumor could be the result of local production(18) or increased uptake.
- (19) IgA1 was one of the dominating proteins found in the far Western blot, present
  in all sera of different ABO blood groups.
- In our experiment, there was no clear difference in the expression pattern of IgA1
  HPA binding in sera from healthy women, bcmet−, and bcmet+.
- However, there was a large individual difference in the far Western blot experiment
  of whole sera indicating quantitative differences.
- Since the bottom line is to find functional differences originating from differences
  in glycosylating pattern, it is not only important to hunt for differences, but
  also to map the Glycome.
- Our main task is to analyze proteins from the sera binding HPA and correlating the
  degree of metastasis and outcome of disease.
- There is a great potential of lectin affinity chromatography for the reduction of
  the complexity in sera.
- The lectin capture simultaneously concentrates classes of glycoproteins and eliminates
  some of the major blood protein, such as albumin.
- The resolution of 1D-PAGE is still too low to be able to detect enough differences
  in sera and a second dimension of separation is probably necessary to reveal suitable
  biomarkers.
- Our results emphasize the fact that the blood group phenotypes are of most importance
  when using the lectin HPA or the use of other blood group-recognizing lectins (e.g.,
  _Dolichos biflorus_ (DBA), _Vicia villosa_ (VVA), _Phaseolus lunatus_ (LBA) and
  _Glycine max_ (SBA) recognizing blood group A-antigen, and _Griffonia simplicifolia_
  I agglutinin B4 (GS-I B4) and _Ulex europaeus_ I (UEA-I) recognizing blood group
  B- and O-antigens, respectively) in the recognition of cancer biomarkers in sera
  and plasma.
- This is especially true when samples from different individuals are pooled and analyzed
  using the blood group-recognizing lectins.
- We believe that a more detailed mapping of all HPA binding proteins have a potential
  to reveal useful biomarkers for human adenocarcinomas.
