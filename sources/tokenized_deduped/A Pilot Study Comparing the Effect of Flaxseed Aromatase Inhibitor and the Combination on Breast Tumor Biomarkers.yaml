- Use of complementary approaches is common among breast cancer survivors.
- Potential interactions between aromatase inhibitors (AI) and high phytoestrogen
  foods, such as flaxseed (FS), are not often described.
- We conducted a pilot 2 × 2 factorial, randomized intervention study between tumor
  biopsy and resection, in 24 postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor positive
  (ER+) breast cancer, to assess the effects of FS and anastrozole, and possible interactions
  between them, on serum steroid hormone and tumor-related characteristics associated
  with long-term survival (Roswell Park Cancer Institute, 2007–2010).
- The effect of each treatment vs. placebo on outcomes was determined by linear regression
  adjusting for pretreatment measure, stage, and grade.
- Although not statistically significant, mean ERβ expression was approximately 40%
  lower from pre- to postintervention in the FS + AI group only.
- We observed a statistically significant negative association (β ± SE −0.3 ± 0.1;
  _P_ = 0.03) for androstenedione in the FS + AI group vs. placebo and for DHEA with
  AI treatment (β ± SE −1.6 ± 0.6; _P_ = 0.009).
- Enterolactone excretion was much lower in the FS + AI group compared to the FS group.
- Our results do not support strong effects of FS on AI activity for selected breast
  tumor characteristics or serum steroid hormone levels but suggest AI therapy might
  reduce the production of circulating mammalian lignans from FS.
