- Phytoestrogens are structurally similar to estrogens and may affect breast cancer
  risk by mimicking estrogenic/antiestrogenic properties.
- In Western societies, whole grains and possibly soy foods are rich sources of phytoestrogens.
- A population-based case-control study in German postmenopausal women was used to
  evaluate the association of phytoestrogen-rich foods and dietary lignans with breast
  cancer risk.
- Dietary data were collected from 2,884 cases and 5,509 controls using a validated
  food-frequency questionnaire, which included additional questions phytoestrogen-rich
  foods.
- Associations were assessed using conditional logistic regression.
- All analyses were adjusted for relevant risk and confounding factors.
- Polytomous logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the associations
  by estrogen receptor (ER) status.
- High and low consumption of soybeans as well as of sunflower and pumpkin seeds were
  associated with significantly reduced breast cancer risk compared to no consumption
  (OR = 0.83, 95% CI = 0.70–0.97; and OR = 0.66, 95% CI = 0.77–0.97, respectively).
- The observed associations were not differential by ER status.
- No statistically significant associations were found for dietary intake of plant
  lignans, fiber, or the calculated enterolignans.
- Our results provide evidence for a reduced postmenopausal breast cancer risk associated
  with increased consumption of sunflower and pumpkin seeds and soybeans.

- The availability of soy food products on the market in Western countries has increased
  over the last decade, along with a health-promoting image of these foods.
- According to data from the latest National Food Consumption Survey, NVS II, conducted
  between March 2005 and November 2006, on average, 2 to 3 g/day of soy foods are
  being consumed by adults in Germany.
- Thus, an assessment of the role of soy food in relation to breast cancer risk seems
  meaningful.
- In this study, we investigated the association of consumption of phytoestrogen-rich
  foods (soy milk, soybeans, soy spreads, tofu, sunflower or pumpkin seeds, sesame
  seeds or flaxseed, as well as, fruits, vegetables, and bread intake) and the estimated
  intake of different classes of lignans (secoisolariciresinol, matairesinol, enterolactone,
  and enterodiol) with the postmenopausal breast cancer risk in a German case-control
  study.
- We also tested the association between dietary fiber intake and postmenopausal breast
  cancer risk.
- Additionally, we examined whether this association is modified by estrogen receptor
  (ER), or progesterone receptor (PR) status of the tumor.
- A population-based case-control study MARIE (Mammary Carcinoma Risk Factor Investigation)
  was carried out in 2 study regions in Germany (Hamburg and Rhine-Neckar-Karlsruhe).
- German-speaking women aged 50 to 74 yr and diagnosed with histologically confirmed
  primary invasive or in situ breast cancer between January 1, 2001, and September
  30, 2005, in Hamburg and between August 1, 2002, and July 31, 2005, in the Rhine-Neckar-Karlsruhe
  region were identified through participating clinics and the Hamburg cancer registry.
- For each patient, 2 controls matched for birth year and study center were randomly
  selected using local residents’ registries.
- In total, 3,919 cases and 7,521 controls participated in the study (participation
  rates of 64% and 43.3%, respectively) (2020\.

- Women were considered postmenopausal if their last menstrual bleeding was at least
  12 mo prior to age at diagnosis for cases, and at least 12 mo prior to age at recruitment
  for controls.
- Furthermore, women who reported having a bilateral oophorectomy or cessation of
  menses due to radiation or chemotherapy, women with unclear menopausal status due
  to a hysterectomy or hormone use, and women older than 55 yr were considered postmenopausal.
- All participants were interviewed using a standardized questionnaire, to obtain
  information on sociodemographic factors and possible breast cancer risk factors
  such as menstrual history, reproductive history, family history of breast cancer,
  breast feeding, smoking, and alcohol consumption.
- All participants gave written confirmed consent.
- The study was approved by the ethics committee of both the University of Heidelberg
  and the University of Hamburg and conducted in agreement with the Helsinki declaration.
- A self-administered validated 176-item food-frequency questionnaire (FFQ) similar
  to the FFQ that was used in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and
  Nutrition (EPIC) Germany was applied.
- Six phytoestrogen-rich food items (soybeans, soy milk, tofu, soy spread, sunflower/pumpkin
  seed, and sesame/flaxseed) were added to the FFQ, which was not designed for quantification
  of phytoestrogens.
- However, these food items have not been validated and were therefore not included
  in the calculation of dietary lignan intake.
- Mean daily intake in g/day was estimated for each food item.
- The FFQ referred to nutritional habits in the year prior to diagnosis of breast
  cancer or prior to questionnaire completion.
- For cases, the median time interval between breast cancer diagnosis and completion
  of the FFQ was 5.9 mo.
- For each food item in the FFQ, the information about portion size and consumption
  frequency was used to calculate intakes in g/day.
- The nutrients were estimated using the German food composition table BLS II.3 (Bundesinstitut
  für Gesundheitlichen Verbraucherschutz und Veterinärmedizin).
- The questionnaire was validated for food groups, energy, and nutrient intake (2121\.

- After restriction to postmenopausal women and excluding participants with missing
  data on the FFQ, and exclusion of the top and bottom 1% of the energy intake range,
  2,884 cases and 5,509 controls were included in the statistical analyses.
- Median intake of phytoestrogen-rich food items and lignans in cases and controls
  was compared using the Wilcoxon rank test.
- Low and high consumers of the 6 phytoestrogen-rich food items were defined by the
  50th percentile of consumption among controls.
- Conditional logistic regression analysis (used for stratified logistic models) was
  used to assess the association of phytoestrogen-rich foods as well as of the different
  classes of lignans with postmenopausal breast cancer risk.
- Stratified logistic regression was applied to account for possible bias introduced
  by the matching variables, age, and study center.
- For the phytoestrogen-rich foods, high consumers and low consumers were compared
  to nonconsumers.
- Dietary lignan and fiber intake was divided into quintiles based on the distribution
  of the controls, and the lowest quintile of intake was used as the reference group.
- Total bread, vegetable, and fruit intake was categorized into tertiles, using the
  lowest tertile as reference group.
- Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using the PROC
  LOGISTIC procedure of the SAS statistical software package, v. 9.2 (SAS Institute,
  Cary, NC).
- All analyses were stratified by birth year and study center.
- Multivariate analyses were adjusted for menopausal induction (natural with/without
  hormonal replacement therapy, bilateral oophorectomy (chemical or by radiation),
  hysterectomy, start of hormonal replacement therapy, other), body mass index (BMI)
  (&lt;22.5, 22.5–25, 25–30, ≥30 kg/m2), occupational level (blue collar worker, simple
  employee, medium employee, higher employee, leading position), first-degree family
  history of breast cancer (yes, no, unknown), history of benign breast disease (yes,
  no), number of pregnancies (≥28th wk) (0, 1, 2, ≥3), age at menarche (&lt;12, 12–14,
  ≥15), breastfeeding history (ever, never), total number of screening mammograms
  (0, 1–4, 5–9, ≥10, unknown), smoking habit (never, past, current), alcohol consumption
  (g/day) (0, 0–18.9, ≥19), consumption of phytoestrogen supplements (yes, no), and
  energy intake (kcal/day).
- Possible confounding by fiber intake (mg/day) was assessed by including fiber intake
  as a continuous variable in the regression models of phytoestrogen-rich foods and
  estimated dietary lignans.
- Additionally, subgroup analyses by low and high dietary fiber intake (&lt;median
  vs. ≥median, where median = 19.7 g) were performed.
- Tests for trend were performed using continuous values of the variables.
- Polytomous logistic regression analysis (used for modeling multilevel outcome variable)
  was used to assess the association of the phytoestrogen-rich foods and lignans with
  postmenopausal breast cancer risk by estrogen receptor (ER+, ER−) and progesterone
  receptor (PR+, PR−) status of the tumor.
- Sensitivity analysis of the effect of time until FFQ completion was performed by
  analyses in subgroups according to median time between diagnosis and FFQ completion
  of the cases, which comprised 5.6 mo.
- The Q statistic was used to test for heterogeneity.
- For all analyses, 2-sided _P_ values below 0.05 were considered significant.
- Cases and controls were, on average, 63.3 ± 5.5 and 63.2 ± 5.4 yr old, respectively.
- A description of the sociodemographic variables and several breast cancer risk factors
  for cases and controls is presented in Table 1.
- Cases were more likely than controls to have a lower number of pregnancies, a history
  of benign breast disease, a higher number of screening mammograms, a first-degree
  family history of breast cancer, and to have taken phytoestrogen supplements; cases
  were less likely to have had a natural menopause and a history of breastfeeding.
- Energy intake was significantly higher for cases than for controls (_P_ = 0.0004)
  (mean energy intake of 1,737 kcal/day and 1,703 kcal/day for cases and controls,
  respectively).
- 'Aida Karina Zaineddina, Katharina Bucka, Alina Vrielinga, Judith Heinzb, Dieter

  Median intake of the 6 phytoestrogen-rich food items and of estimated dietary plant
  lignans and enterolignans is presented for cases and controls, separately (Table
  2).'
- Sunflower and pumpkin seeds were most frequently consumed by both cases and controls
  (56% and 58%, respectively).
- Soy milk showed the highest average consumption level among these food items (median
  intake of 12.3 g/day for both cases and controls).
- Cases had significantly higher bread and fruit intake.
- Moreover, cases had a slightly but significantly higher fiber intake when compared
  to controls.
- No significant differences were observed between cases and controls regarding intake
  of individual lignans.
- 'Aida Karina Zaineddina, Katharina Bucka, Alina Vrielinga, Judith Heinzb, Dieter
  Flesch-Janysbc, Jakob Linseisend &amp; Jenny Chang-Claudea











  High consumption of sunflower or pumpkin seeds was associated with a reduced postmenopausal
  breast cancer risk compared to no consumption (OR = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.77–0.97, _P_
  trend = 0.02).'
- Similarly, high consumption of soybeans (vs. nonconsumers) was inversely associated
  with postmenopausal breast cancer risk (OR = 0.83, 95% CI = 0.70–0.97, _P_-trend
  = 0.02) (Table 3).
- 'Aida Karina Zaineddina, Katharina Bucka, Alina Vrielinga, Judith Heinzb, Dieter
  Flesch-Janysbc, Jakob Linseisend &amp; Jenny Chang-Claudea











  Other phytoestrogen-rich foods, such as soy milk, tofu, soy spread, sesame seeds,
  or flaxseed, were inversely but not significantly associated with postmenopausal
  breast cancer risk.'
- No associations were observed for bread, vegetable, and fruit intake (Table 3).
- A sensitivity analysis of the timing of FFQ completion showed that the associations
  found for soybeans and sunflower and pumpkin seeds were statistically significant
  only in the subgroup that completed the FFQ within 6 mo after diagnosis.
- However, the test for heterogeneity was not significant (_P_ heterogeneity = 0.10).
- None of the individual plant lignans and enterolignans or overall fiber intake was
  statistically significantly associated with postmenopausal breast cancer risk (Table
  4).
- There was also no association between plant lignans and enterolignans with postmenopausal
  breast cancer in the subgroups of women with high and with low dietary fiber intake
  (Supplemental Table 1).
- 'Aida Karina Zaineddina, Katharina Bucka, Alina Vrielinga, Judith Heinzb, Dieter
  Flesch-Janysbc, Jakob Linseisend &amp; Jenny Chang-Claudea











  When considering postmenopausal breast cancer risk by ER status, we found that plant
  lignans, enterolignans, and fiber intake were not differentially associated with
  ER+ and ER− tumors (Table 5).'
- High consumption of sunflower and pumpkin seeds was associated with a decreased
  risk, which was statistically significant for ER+ tumors (OR = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.77–0.99,
  _P_ trend = 0.02) and not for ER− tumors (OR = 0.90, 95% CI = 0.72–1.12, _P_ trend
  = 0.30), but there was no significant heterogeneity by ER status (_P_ heterogeneity
  = 0.7).
- The inverse association observed for high soybean consumers was significant only
  for ER− tumors (OR = 0.66, 95% CI = 0.46–0.94, _P_ trend = 0.02), although the risk
  for ER+ tumors was also reduced (OR = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.74–1.05) and not significantly
  different from that for ER− tumors (_P_ heterogeneity = 0.2).
- No statistically significant associations by ER status were found for any of the
  other phytoestrogen-rich foods (Table 6).
- Associations between phytoestrogen-rich foods or dietary plant lignans/enterolignans
  and breast cancer risk were not statistically significantly different by progesterone
  receptor (PR) status of the tumor (data not shown).

  In this large case-control study, we found that high consumption of both soybeans
  and of sunflower or pumpkin seeds was associated with a significantly reduced postmenopausal
  breast cancer risk.'
- We did not observe any association between dietary lignans and estimated enterolignans
  and postmenopausal breast cancer risk.
- The observed associations were not differential by estrogen receptor status of the
  tumor.
- Soybeans were the most frequently consumed soy product in our study population and
  are the main source of isoflavones (2828\.

- Also, soy foods available in Western countries might have different isoflavone content
  when compared to traditional soy foods due to diverse methods of processing.
- Using studies selected for comprehensive assessment of soy intake, Wu and colleagues
  concluded in a meta-analysis of 8 studies in high soy-consuming Asian populations
  (isoflavone intake levels from 5 to 20 mg/day) and 11 studies in low soy-consuming
  Western populations (isoflavone levels from 0.15 to 0.8 mg/day) that soy intake
  was related to breast cancer risk in Asian but not Western populations (1515\.

- One study found a protective association between high consumption of soy milk and

- We also observed nonsignificant associations of high consumption of tofu and soy
  spread with lower postmenopausal breast cancer risk.
- Our significant finding solely for high consumption of soybeans might be attributed
  to its greater prevalence in the study population.
- It has been hypothesized that isoflavones protect against breast cancer through
  competitive binding to estrogen receptors.
- Two Asian studies that investigated the association between soy consumption and
  breast cancer by ER status reported a protective effect in ER+ tumors but not ER−
  tumors (3434\.

- Our data showed a nonsignificant stronger inverse association with consumption of
  soybeans for ER− tumors than for ER+ tumors in postmenopausal women.
- This may be a chance finding.
- On the other hand, although the estrogenic properties of isoflavones are well established,
  there is also evidence for hormone receptor-independent anticarcinogenic mechanisms
  of isoflavones, such as inhibition of angiogenesis and cell proliferation, as well
  as stimulation of apoptosis (1111\.

- We did not observe an association for dietary lignan intake and estimated enterolignans
  with postmenopausal breast cancer risk.
- Yet two recently published meta-analyses reported evidence for a significantly reduced
  postmenopausal breast cancer risk associated with high plant lignan exposure based
  on data from 6 studies assessing dietary intake of plant lignans in postmenopausal
  women (1919\.

- '_Br J Cancer_, 100: 1492–1498.'
- View all references).
- The diverging results between our study and the meta-analyses may be due, in part,
  to substantial imprecision in the exposure data, especially the underestimation
  of dietary lignan intake, as there are several further plant lignans (e.g., pinoresinol
  and lariciresinol) (3939\.

- View all references) that were not included in our database for the estimation of
  lignan contents and therefore not specifically estimated in our study.
- This food composition database was constructed using the available analytic data
  from the literature and may therefore also be incomplete for several food sources
  of lignans.
- However, some studies included in the meta-analyses also did not include pinoresinol
  and lariciresinol intake data.
- According to a Dutch study, secoisolariciresinol and matairesinol contributed to
  25% of total plant lignan intake whereas pinoresinol and lariciresinol contributed
  to about 75% (4040\.

- Although it is difficult to generalize these percentages across populations, dietary
  habits in Germany and the Netherlands are likely to be comparable.
- We observed an inverse association between high consumption of sunflower/pumpkin
  seeds, rich sources of lariciresinol and pinoresinol, and postmenopausal breast
  cancer risk.
- To our knowledge, no previous study has reported on the association of different
  types of seeds, which are rich sources of lignans in the Western diet, with postmenopausal
  breast cancer risk.
- Sunflower and pumpkin seeds are often included as ingredients to breads and buns,
  which are consumed regularly at meals in Germany.
- There may be less misclassification in the reporting of consumption of these food
  items as compared to incomplete/imprecise quantification of food components, which
  generally facilitates detection of differences in exposure between cases and controls.
- The inverse association of sunflower or pumpkin seeds and breast cancer risk was
  not differential by receptor status.
- Lignans have been shown to act through both hormone-dependent and hormone-independent
  mechanisms against breast cancer risk.
- Moreover, seeds contain additional constituents beside lignans, such as α-linoleic
  acids, that also exert anticarcinogenic properties, so that the association observed
  with seed consumption may not be solely attributed to its lignan content (4141\.

- Also seeds are rich in fiber (4343\.

- 1990
- 'Western diet and Western diseases: some hormonal and biochemical mechanisms and
  associations.'
- '_Scand J Clin Lab Invest Suppl_, 201: 3–23.'
- View all references); therefore, we adjusted the analyses for sunflower and pumpkin
  seeds by fiber intake, but the results did not change substantially, indicating
  that the protective effect of sunflower and pumpkin seeds cannot be due entirely
  to the fiber content.
- Dietary lignans are present in fiber-rich foods and both substances were correlated
  within this study population (4444\.
- Adlercreutz , H .
- 2007
- Lignans and human health.
- '_Crit Rev Clin Lab Sci_, 44: 483–525.'
- View all references).
- Therefore, overall fiber intake could have an effect on postmenopausal breast cancer
  risk.
- In our data, fiber intake was not found to be significantly associated with breast
  cancer risk and was also not a relevant confounder for the associations assessed
  of dietary lignans and lignan-rich foods in relation to breast cancer risk.
- The main advantages of this study are the large sample size, the completeness of
  the risk factor data, and the detailed dietary assessment of nutritional habits
  using a validated FFQ that assesses diet over the year prior to diagnosis.
- The additional questions on dietary intake of soy foods (tofu, soy milk, soybeans,
  soy spread) and lignan-rich plant foods (sunflower/pumpkin seed, sesame/flaxseed)
  supplemented the FFQ that was not designed for quantification of phytoestrogens;
  however, they have not been validated, and these food items were not included in
  the calculation of dietary lignan intake.
- Misclassification of some exposures therefore cannot be excluded.
- The enterolignan levels in our study were estimated by means of data derived from
  in vitro fermentation of foods with human faeces (2424\.

- Intra- and interindividual variation in gut bacteria and thus metabolism of plants
  into enterolignans may cause differences in the amounts of bioavailable enterolignans,
  which cannot be individually quantified using FFQ data.
- In conclusion, the present study provides some evidence for a reduced postmenopausal
  breast cancer risk when consuming a diet rich in sunflower or pumpkin seeds and
  soybeans.
- However, not many studies investigated the association between soy foods and postmenopausal
  breast cancer risk in a Western population.
- Further studies using biomarkers of phytoestrogen intake will contribute to a better
  understanding of this subject.
- Large epidemiological studies are warranted to elucidate the association of the
  different classes of phytoestrogens with postmenopausal breast cancer risk, as well
  as experimental studies to unravel the underlying mechanisms.
