- Phenolic compounds were determined in artichoke (_Cynara scolymus_), garlic (_Allium
  sativium_) and spinach (_Spinacia oleracea_) using a single method based on simple
  extraction and ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to triple quadrupole
  tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QqQ-MS/MS).
- Several compounds belonging to different families, such as phenolic acids, isoflavones,
  flavones and flavonols, were determined.
- The analytical procedure was validated in all the matrices, obtaining recoveries
  ranging from 60 to 120 % with reproducibility values (expressed as relative standard
  deviations (RSDs)) lower than 26 %.
- Limits of quantification (LOQs) were always equal to or lower than 50 μg/kg, except
  to kaempferol and its glucosides in spinach (LOQs = 75 μg/kg).
- Artichoke showed higher concentration of phenolic compounds (837.2 mg/kg dry weight
  (DW)) than garlic (26.5 mg/kg DW) or spinach (64.5 mg/kg DW).
- Apigenin 7-_O_-glucoside (from 147.0 to 722.7 mg/kg DW) was found to be the major
  flavonoid in all samples of artichoke investigated, while chlorogenic acid, whose
  concentration ranged from 37.8 to 734.7 mg/kg DW, is the major phenolic acid in
  this matrix.
- Regarding garlic, caffeic acid (from 1.7 to 28.3 mg/kg DW) and quercetin (from 9.0
  to 18.9 mg/kg DW) were the compounds detected at higher concentrations, although
  in general the total content was very low in relation to other matrices.
- In relation to spinach, ferulic acid was the major phenolic compound, and its concentration
  ranged from 18.0 to 41.4 mg/kg DW.
- Recent evidence from the PREDIMED (acronym of a long-term nutritional intervention
  study aimed to assess the efficacy of the Mediterranean diet) study confirms the
  relationship between Mediterranean diet and health (Estruch et al.
- 2013).
- The health-promoting effects of this diet have been mainly attributed to a high
  intake of fruit, vegetables, olive oil, nuts, and cereals; a moderate intake of
  fish, poultry and wine; and a low intake of dairy products, meat and sweets (Vallverdú-Queralt
  et al.
- 2013).
- Some vegetables, such as artichoke _(Cynara scolymus)_, spinach (_Spinacia oleracea_)
  and garlic (_Allium sativium_), are important because their composition and high
  consumption and their worldwide production are 1.5, 20 and 23 million tonnes in
  2013 respectively (FAO statistics 2013).
- These vegetables are highly valued among consumers due to their flavour and health-promoting
  effects.
- Recent studies have demonstrated that artichoke, garlic and spinach have high medicinal
  benefits, such as antioxidant (Cao et al.
- 1998; Chung 2006; Rezazadeh et al.
- 2012), anticarcinogenic (Akasaka et al.
- 2013; Mileo et al.
- 2012; Shukla and Kalra 2007), cholesterol-lowering (Bundy et al.
- 2008; Durak et al.
- 2004), hepatoprotective (Gebhardt 1997; Obioha et al.
- 2009), antidiabetic (Fantini et al.
- 2011; Mann and Aune 2010; Padiya et al.
- 2011) and anti-inflammatory properties (Zapolska-Downar et al.
- 2002), which have been mainly attributed to the presence of phenolic compounds in
  these matrices (Kopeć et al.
- 2013; Lattanzio et al.
- 2009; Lomnitski et al.
- 2003).
- Phenolic compounds, such as chlorogenic acid (up to 2,877 mg/kg dry weight (DW))
  and luteolin glycosides (up to 2,700 mg/kg DW), have been reported as the bioactive
  compounds detected at the highest concentrations in artichoke (Pandino et al.
- 2013).
- In relation to garlic, myricetin, apigenin or quercetin were detected in Malaysian
  garlic at high concentrations (693, 217 and 47 mg/kg DW respectively) (Miean and
  Mohamed 2001), whereas in other studies, only quercetin was detected at 80.6 mg/kg
  DW in Polish garlic (Gorinstein et al.
- 2008), or they were not detected (Beato et al.
- 2011; Sultana and Anwar 2008).
- Regarding the presence of phenolic acids in garlic, caffeic acid (ranged from not
  detected to 13.6 mg/kg DW) (Beato et al.
- 2011; Gorinstein et al.
- 2008; Mattila and Hellström 2007) and ferulic acid (ranged from 0.3 to 15.2 mg/kg
  DW) (Beato et al.
- 2011; Gorinstein et al.
- 2008) were detected at the highest concentrations.
- In relation to spinach, kaempferol (from 71 to 3,667 mg/kg DW) and quercetin (from
  not detected to 766 mg/kg DW) (Cao et al.
- 2010; Nuutila et al.
- 2002) were the predominant flavonoids, although some quercetin glycosides were also
  detected (Khanama et al.
- 2012).
- Moreover, several phenolic acids were determined in spinach, such as chlorogenic
  acid, caffeic acid and ferulic acid, among others (Khanama et al.
- 2012).
- It can be observed that several families of phenolic compounds could be determined
  in these types of vegetables, and therefore, suitable analytical methods that allow
  the simultaneous determination of these compounds should be developed.
- In this sense, different methods were applied for the extraction of phenolic compounds
  from the matrices cited above.
- Ultrasound-assisted extraction was used for the extraction of phenolic compounds
  from artichoke (Abu-Reidah et al.
- 2013), garlic (Taskeen et al.
- 2010) and spinach (Bottino et al.
- 2009), using methanol/water as an extraction solvent but in different proportions,
  80:20 _v_/_v_ (Abu-Reidah et al.
- 2013; Taskeen et al.
- 2010) and 70:30 _v_/_v_ (Bottino et al.
- 2009).
- For the extraction of phenolic compounds from spinach, pressurized liquid extraction
  (PLE) was also used, utilizing a mixture of methanol/water, 70:30 _v_/_v_ (Santos
  et al.
- 2014).
- Phenolic compounds were also extracted from garlic (Bozin et al.
- 2008) and artichoke (Negro et al.
- 2012) using maceration, utilizing as extraction solvent an aqueous solution of methanol
  (80 %) or a mixture of acetone/ethanol/methanol (70:15:15 _v_/_v_/_v_) respectively.
- In both cases, after maceration, the extract was evaporated to dryness under vacuum.
- For the extraction of phenolic compounds in garlic, quick, easy, cheap, effective,
  rugged and safe (QuEChERS) procedure, using a clean-up step with primary secondary
  amine (PSA), C18 and magnesium sulphate, was also applied (Silva et al.
- 2012).
- In some cases, an acid treatment was used to hydrolyze the glycosides, and the content
  of free and conjugated flavonoids such as aglycones is determined.
- For instance, this procedure was applied in spinach and garlic, using 1.2 M hydrochloric
  acid (HCl) in methanol/water (50:50 _v_/_v_) (Gorinstein et al.
- 2008; Nuutila et al.
- 2002), or a mixture of ethanol/water/HCl (80:10:10 _v_/_v_/_v_) and butylated hydroxytoluene
  (BHT) (Cao et al.
- 2010; Gorinstein et al.
- 2008; Nuutila et al.
- 2002).
- Several analytical methods have been reported for the separation and determination
  of phenolic compounds in vegetables.
- The most commonly used technique is high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)
  coupled to ultraviolet (UV) (Miean and Mohamed 2001), photodiode array detection
  (DAD) (Pandino et al.
- 2013; Howard et al.
- 2002), mass spectrometry (MS) (Bunea et al.
- 2008), or tandem MS (MS/MS) (Bottino et al.
- 2009; Konar et al.
- 2012).
- MS/MS has become one of the main techniques for determination and quantification
  purposes, since this offers unambiguous identification and quantification of phenolic
  compounds and adequate sensitivity.
- Recently, ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) has emerged as a
  good alternative to HPLC insomuch as UHPLC offers other advantages such as shorter
  running time, better resolution and higher sensitivity.
- Besides, UHPLC can be coupled to MS/MS allowing a rapid and effective detection
  of a wide range of compounds such as antibiotics, pesticides, mycotoxins, phenolic
  compounds or biogenic amines among others in different food matrices (Núnez et al.
- 2012).
- Although there are several studies determining phenolic compounds in different matrices,
  there are few studies that fully validated the proposed methodologies (Konar et
  al.
- 2012; Santos et al.
- 2014; Silva et al.
- 2012).
- Therefore, the aim of the present work has been the determination of the phenolic
  composition in different types of vegetables, such as artichoke, garlic and spinach,
  applying a single method based on solid-liquid extraction (SLE) and UHPLC-MS/MS.
- For that purpose, a method previously performed has been fully validated in these
  matrices, checking its suitability as well as its application to several samples
  of each type of matrix, contributing to increase the knowledge about the presence
  of phenolic compounds in these types of vegetables.
- Commercial phenolic compound standards such as apigenin-7-_O-_glucoside, apigenin-6-_C-_glucoside,
  apigenin-8-_C-_glucoside, apigenin-7-_O-_rutinoside, apigenin-7-_O-_neohesperoside,
  daidzein, isorhamnetin, isorhamnetin-3-_O-_glucoside, isorhamnetin-3-_O-_rutinoside,
  kaempferol, kaempferol-3-_O-_glucoside, kaempferol-3-_O-_rutinoside, glycitein,
  luteolin, luteolin-6-_C-_glucoside, luteolin-8-_C-_glucoside, luteolin-4-_O-_glucoside,
  luteolin-7-_O-_glucoside, quercetin-3-_O-_galactoside, quercetin-3-_O-_rhamnoside,
  quercetin-3-_O-_rutinoside and tamarixetin were purchased from Extrasynthese (Genay,
  France).
- Other standards such as apigenin, baicalein, caffeic acid, ferulic acid, gallic
  acid, genistein, quercetin and quercetin 3-_O-_glucoside were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
  (Steinheim, Germany).
- Stock standard solutions of individual compounds (with concentrations between 200
  and 300 mg/L) were prepared by precise weighing of the powdered compounds in a calibration
  flask of 10 mL.
- Then, HPLC grade methanol or a mixture of methanol/water (50:50 _v_/_v_) was added
  to dissolve the standards.
- Then, the mixture was stored at −20 °C in dark bottles.
- A multicompound working standard solution at a concentration of 5 mg/L of each compound
  was prepared by appropriate dilution of the stock solutions with methanol and stored
  in screw-capped glass tubes at −20 °C.
- The solutions were prepared every 6 months.
- Formic acid (purity &gt;98 %) was provided by Sigma-Aldrich.
- Ultrapure water was obtained from a Milli-Q Gradient water system (Millipore, Bedford,
  MA, USA).
- Ammonium acetate and anhydrous magnesium sulphate were purchased from Panreac (Barcelona,
  Spain).
- Chromatographic analysis was carried out using an Agilent series 1290 RRLC instrument
  equipped with a binary pump (G4220A), a high-performance autosampler (G4226A), an
  autosampler thermostat (G1330B) and a column compartment thermostat (G1316C).
- The system was coupled to an Agilent triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (6460A)
  with a Jet Stream ESI ion source (G1958-65138), using positive and negative acquisition
  modes.
- For the chromatographic separation of the extracts, a Zorbax Eclipse Plus C18 column
  (100 mm × 2.1 mm, 1.8-μm particle size) from Agilent was used.
- The chromatographic conditions were optimized previously (Alarcón-Flores et al.
- 2013).
- Briefly, chromatographic separation was carried out using a gradient elution with
  methanol as eluent A and an aqueous solution of ammonium acetate (30 mM), adjusted
  to pH 5 with formic acid as eluent B.
- The analysis started with 5 % of eluent A.
- This composition was kept constant during 1.5 min, and then, it was linearly increased
  up to 30 % for 2.5 min.
- Next, it was increased to 100 % for 4 min.
- This composition was held for further 2 min before being returned to the initial
  conditions of 30 s, followed by a re-equilibration time of 30 s, giving a total
  run time of 11 min.
- The flow rate was set at 0.2 mL/min, and column temperature was set at 30 °C.
- An Agilent MassHunter Quantitative analysis (Agilent Technologies, Inc.) was used
  for data acquisition and quantification of samples.
- A Reax-2 rotary agitator from Heidolph (Schwabach, Germany), an ultrasonic from
  Elma (Singen, Germany), lyophilizer Alpha from Martin Christ (Osterode, Germany),
  vacuum pump from Vacuubrand (Wertheim, Germany) and analytical balance CPA-225-D
  from Sartorius (Goettingen, Germany) were also utilized.
- Samples were homogenized, transferred to a petri dish, weighed and cooled to −18
  °C.
- All samples were processed according to a simple SLE, developed previously (Alarcón-Flores
  et al.
- 2013).
- Briefly, 150 mg of lyophilized sample was weighed in a 15-mL polypropylene centrifuge
  tube, and 3 mL of methanol/water (80:20 _v_/_v_) was added.
- The mixture was agitated for 30 min using a rotary shaker.
- After that, the extract was filtered, and 300 μL was transferred into a vial containing
  200 μL of mobile phase (50:50 _v_/_v_ of eluents A and B), and 5 μL was injected
  into the UHPLC system.
- Twelve samples of each matrix (artichoke, spinach and garlic) were collected from
  supermarkets located in the province of Almería.
- Samples were chopped and homogenized at room temperature.
- All samples were kept frozen at −18 °C until lyophilization.
- A validation protocol of the optimized method was carried out in order to establish
  the suitable characteristics of the method.
- Several parameters such as matrix effect, linearity, limits of detection (LODs),
  limits of quantification (LOQs) trueness (expressed as recovery), intra-day precision
  and inter-day precision were studied.
- Matrix effect was studied to ensure bias-free analytical results.
- Because the samples were not standard reference materials and no blank samples were
  available, one sample of artichoke, garlic and spinach was spiked after extraction
  with the phenolic compounds at different concentrations (from 0.05 to 2 mg/L), and
  the slopes of the calibration plots were compared with the results obtained when
  standard solutions of the phenolic compounds were analyzed.
- The linearity of the method was also studied, using a sample extract to prepare
  the calibration curve (0.05 to 2 mg/L).
- In all the cases, determination coefficient was higher than 0.98.
- LODs and LOQs were determined as the lowest concentration level that yielded a signal-to-noise
  (S/N) ratio of 3 and 10 (when the quantification ion was monitored) respectively.
- Bearing in mind the presence of matrix effect and no “blank” matrices were available,
  LODs and LOQs were estimated by extrapolation of the S/N of the extract with known
  amount of analytes, and they were expressed as microgram per kilogram in matrix.
- Trueness was estimated through recovery studies.
- Before extraction, different aliquots of each matrix (artichoke, garlic and spinach)
  (_n_ = 5) were spiked with the target compounds at two concentration levels, 2.5
  and 5.0 mg/kg.
- Then, they were extracted using the method previously commented (S1).
- 'Other aliquots of each matrix (artichoke, garlic and spinach) (_n_ = 5) were extracted
  without spiking (S0), and recovery was calculated as follows: _R_ = 100 × (S1 −
  S0) / spiked concentration.'
- Precision of the overall method was estimated by performing both repeatability and
  reproducibility (inter-day precision) studies.
- Repeatability was evaluated at 2.5 and 5.0 mg/kg of the recovery studies, performing
  five replicates at each level.
- Inter-day precision was evaluated at 2.5 and 5 mg/kg in five different days, injecting
  three replicates each day.
- A validation protocol of the optimized procedure was carried out in order to establish
  the performance characteristics of the method, ensuring the adequate identification,
  confirmation and quantification of the target compounds.
- First matrix effect was studied, and slope ratios of matrix/solvent for each compound
  in the matrices evaluated are shown in Fig.
- 1
- A tolerable signal suppression or enhancement effect was considered if the slope
  ratio ranged between 0.8 and 1.2 (Kmellár et al.
- 2008).
- Values lower than 0.8 or higher than 1.2 imply a signal suppression or enhancement,
  respectively.
- It can be observed that matrix significantly suppresses or enhances the response
  for all phenolic compounds depending on the type of matrix, except for apigenin.
- For this compound, no matrix effect was observed in any of the matrices tested.
- In spinach, signal suppression was mainly observed, although for some compounds
  such as luteolin-_C_-glucoside, chlorogenic acid, isorhamnetin and tamarixetin,
  signal enhancement was noted.
- In this matrix, there were also some compounds that did not present matrix effect
  such as apigenin, luteolin-_C_-glucoside, genistein, kaempferol and quercetin.
- On the other hand, no strong matrix effect was observed for most of the compounds
  in garlic, although for those compounds with significant matrix effect, signal enhancement
  was mainly observed, except for apigenin-_C_-glucoside, daidzein and glycitein,
  which had signal suppression.
- When matrix effect was evaluated in artichoke, both signal suppression and enhancement
  were observed, although there were several compounds that did not present matrix
  effect.
- For this matrix, it is important to highlight that the matrix effect for chlorogenic
  acid was almost 10, suggesting that matrix compounds significantly enhance the signal
  of this compound during the ionization process.
- Therefore, in order to compensate this effect, standard addition calibration was
  used for quantification purposes, and one calibration curve was prepared per sample.
- Slope ratios between matrix-matched and solvent calibrations.
- Compliance interval covering the range between 0.8 and 1.2 for tolerable matrix
  effect has been plotted.
- 'Code: _1_ apigenin, _2_ apigenin-_C_-glucoside, _3_ apigenin-_O_-derivate, _4_
  apigenin-7-_O_-glucoside, _5_ baicalein, _6_ luteolin, _7_ luteolin-_C_-glucoside,
  _8_ luteolin-_O_-glucoside, _9_ caffeic acid, _10_ chlorogenic acid, _11_ ferulic
  acid, _12_ gallic acid, _13_ daidzein, _14_ genistein, _15_ glycitein, _16_ isorhamnetin,

  Table 1 shows the LODs and LOQs obtained for the three matrices studied.'
- It can be observed that LODs ranged from 5 to 25 μg/kg, whereas LOQs ranged from
  10 to 50 μg/kg for artichoke and garlic, whereas for spinach, LODs ranged from 1
  to 50 μg/kg and LOQs ranged from 5 to 75 μg/kg (see Table 1).
- When these values were compared to those published in bibliography, it can be noted
  that they were lower than those provided by Mattila and Hellström (2007) in artichoke
  and garlic or Silva et al.
- (2012) in garlic, where LOQs ranged from 20 to 540 μg/kg.
- However, the proposed values are higher than those obtained by Konar et al.
- (2012) in artichoke, although the sensitivity is enough for the suitable determination
  of the target compounds.
- "Limits of detection (LODs) and quantification (LOQs) in artichoke, garlic and spinach
  \ \n\n\nIn relation to trueness study, Table 2 shows the obtained results."
- It can be observed that recoveries ranged from 61 (apigenin-7-_O_-glucoside, luteolin-_C_-glucoside,
  baicalein, caffeic acid and kaempferol-3-_O_-rutinoside) to 108 % (kaempferol) for
  the selected compounds at 2.5 mg/kg and from 66 (luteolin) to 99 % (isorhamnetin)
  at 5 mg/kg for artichoke.
- In artichoke, gallic acid was not recovered.
- This compound was identified by Sánchez-Rabaneda et al.
- (2003) in artichoke waste but not in the raw material.
- For garlic, recoveries ranged from 60 (tamarixetin) to 107 % (caffeic acid) at 2.5
  mg/kg and from 72 (baicalein) to 120 % (apigenin-7-_O_-glucoside) at 5 mg/kg.
- Regarding spinach, the recoveries ranged from 60 (isorhamnetin) to 118 % (ferulic
  acid and isorhamnetin-3-_O_-glucoside) at 2.5 mg/kg and from 61 (luteolin-_C_-glucoside)
  to 118 % (ferulic acid) at 5 mg/kg.
- It can be noted that repeatability values (expressed as relative standard deviation
  (RSD)) were always lower than 22 % in all matrices.
- For inter-day precision, RSD values lower than 26 % were obtained in all the matrices
  (see Table 2).
- Bearing in mind the different physico-chemical properties of the compounds included
  in this study and that they were extracted from several types of vegetables using
  the same procedure, trueness and precision can be considered suitable for reliable
  quantification of target compounds.
- Although some recoveries are not close to 100 %, they are acceptable since they
  are repetitive and reproducible.
- "Validation parameters of the optimized UHPLC-MS/MS method in artichoke, garlic
  and spinach  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce the analytical methodology was validated, it was
  applied to evaluate the concentration of phenolic compounds in artichoke, garlic
  and spinach."
- The samples were analyzed in triplicate, showing the obtained results in Tables
  3, 4 and 5, expressing the results as milligram per kilogram DW.
- Furthermore, the total content as well as the content of different families of phenolic
  compounds in artichoke, garlic and spinach is shown in Fig.
- 2, where it can be observed that artichoke (837.2 mg/kg DW) was the matrix with
  the highest content of phenolic compounds, followed by spinach (64.1 mg/kg DW) and
  garlic (26.5 mg/kg DW).

  In this matrix, flavone is an important family, detecting apigenin-7_-O_-glucoside
  at the highest concentration (from 147.0 to 483.4 mg/kg DW) followed by luteolin-_O_-glucoside
  (30.1 to 276.5 mg/kg DW), apigenin-_O_-derivate (48.8 to 255.7 mg/kg DW), luteolin
  (7.7 to 37.3 mg/kg DW) and apigenin (17.3 to 225.2 mg/kg DW), as it can be observed
  in Table 3.'
- In the literature, the concentrations of apigenin and luteolin glycosides ranged
  from not detected (for both compounds) to 700 and 6,500 mg/kg DW respectively, depending
  on the artichoke genotype analyzed (Pandino et al.
- 2013).
- Regarding the concentration of their aglycones found in previous studies, the concentration
  ranged from not detected to 1,500 mg/kg for apigenin and from 100 to 900 mg/kg DW
  (higher than that in our work) for luteolin (Pandino et al.
- 2013).
- On the other hand, phenolic acids also had an important role in the total content
  of phenolic compounds in artichoke.
- Thus, chlorogenic acid was detected at concentrations ranging from 37.8 to 734.7
  mg/kg DW (Table 3).
- The found concentration is similar to those detected in the other studies, where
  the concentration fluctuated from not detected to 2,100 mg/kg DW (Pandino et al.
- 2013).
- Other phenolic acids such as caffeic acid (from 3.4 to 21.7 mg/kg DW) and ferulic
  acid (from 1 to 2.9 mg/kg DW) were detected in artichoke, although at lower concentrations.
- In the literature, ferulic acid was not detected in Brazilian artichoke (Tiveron
  et al.
- 2012), although Anouar et al.
- (2009) commented that ferulic acid is widely distributed in artichoke.
- Regarding the content of caffeic acid in artichoke, it ranges from 80 to 800 mg/kg
  DW.
- In all the cases, the concentrations of this phenolic acid were higher in the previous
  studies than those in this one.
- In relation to flavonols, isorhamnetin-3-_O_-glucoside (up to 28.3 mg/kg DW) and
  isorhamnetin-3-_O_-rutinoside (up to 23.7 mg/kg DW) were the flavonols detected
  at higher concentrations in the analyzed samples.
- Up to our knowledge, this is the first study that detects the presence of these
  flavonols (isorhamnetin-3-_O_-glucoside and isorhamnetin-3-_O_-rutinoside) in artichoke.
- Finally, isoflavones were also found in artichoke, although only glycitein was detected
  (from 0.1 to 2.7 mg/kg DW).
- However, previous studies did not evaluate the content of isoflavones in artichoke.
- In general, a wide variability in the content of some phenolic compounds such as
  chlorogenic acid, luteolin-_O_-glucoside, apigenin and apigenin glycosides was noted
  among artichoke samples as it can be observed in Table 3.
- This can be explained bearing in mind that several factors such as variety, crop
  type, environmental conditions and maturation could affect the final concentration
  of phenolic compounds.
- Table 4 shows the obtained concentrations of phenolic compounds in garlic.
- The content of the studied phenolic compounds in garlic was lower than in artichoke.
- Flavonols and phenolic acids were the families predominant in this matrix.
- Quercetin was the only flavonol detected in garlic (from 9.0 to 18.9 mg/kg DW).
- This result is in accordance to those obtained previously, where the concentration
  found in garlic ranged from not detected (Beato et al.
- 2011; Sultana and Anwar 2008) to 80 mg/kg (Gorinstein et al.
- 2008).
- Regarding phenolic acids, caffeic acid was the predominant phenolic acid, and its
  mean concentration was 7.2 mg/kg DW, ranging from 1.7 to 28.3 mg/kg DW, followed
  by ferulic acid, whose mean concentration was 3.5 mg/kg DW.
- In previous studies, the concentration found for caffeic and ferulic acids in garlic
  ranged from 0.1 to 13.6 mg/kg (Beato et al.
- 2011) and from 0.3 to 15.2 mg/kg (Gorinstein et al.
- 2008; Mattila and Hellström 2007) respectively.
- It can highlight the high variability observed for the content of caffeic acid in
  the samples analyzed, which can be explained considering the factors cited previously.
- In relation to flavones, apigenin was the only compound detected in the analyzed
  samples, and it was determined at low concentrations (up to 2.1 mg/kg DW).
- In previous studies, the concentration of this compound was 217 mg/kg DW (Lanzotti
  2006) in garlic, although in other studies, this compound was not detected (Beato
  et al.
- 2011; Nuutila et al.
- 2002).
- As it can be observed in Fig.
- 2, phenolic acid was the predominant family in spinach.
- Ferulic acid was detected at the highest concentration, ranging from 18.0 to 41.4
  mg/kg DW, followed by chlorogenic acid (up to 8.6 mg/kg DW) and caffeic acid (up
  to 3.7 mg/kg DW), as it can be indicated in Table 5.
- In previous studies, chlorogenic acid and caffeic acid had been reported up to 13
  mg/kg (Khanama et al.
- 2012), whereas the concentration of ferulic acid ranged from not detected (Khanama
  et al.
- 2012) to 296 mg/kg DW (Bunea et al.
- 2008).
- The content of flavones was also important.
- Thus, apigenin (up to 11.5 mg/kg DW) and luteolin (from 1.6 to 11.7 mg/kg DW) were
  the compounds detected at higher concentrations.
- It is important to indicate that these compounds were not detected previously in
  this matrix (Cao et al.
- 2010).
- In relation to flavonols, quercetin and isorhamnetin were detected.
- The concentration of isorhamnetin (from 3.1 to 11.8 mg/kg DW) was higher than quercetin
  concentration (up to 4.5 mg/kg DW) in spinach samples.
- In previous studies, the concentration of quercetin fluctuated from not detected
  (Cao et al.
- 2010) to 766 mg/kg DW (Nuutila et al.
- 2002), whereas isorhamnetin was not detected previously (Cao et al.
- 2010).
- Regarding isoflavones, glycitein was the only detected compound, and its concentration
  ranged from 2.2 to 5.4 mg/kg DW.
- Up to our knowledge, this is the first study that detects the presence of isoflavones
  in spinach.
- This work presents a suitable method for the extraction, detection and quantification
  of phenolic compounds in artichoke, garlic and spinach by SLE and UHPLC-QqQ-MS/MS.
- Extraction method, previously performed in other matrices, was checked for the suitable
  extraction of these compounds from the aforementioned matrices.
- This methodology was validated in these matrices, obtaining suitable results.
- The reliability of the method was performed by checking its suitability in different
  matrices.
- Moreover, the content of phenolic compounds in different matrices was compared,
  and the main results indicated that artichoke contains higher levels of phenolic
  compounds than garlic and spinach.
- Flavone family was the predominant family in artichoke, while in garlic and spinach,
  flavonols and phenolic acids were the most significant respectively.
- Finally, some compounds which were not previously detected in these samples were
  detected, although at low concentrations.
