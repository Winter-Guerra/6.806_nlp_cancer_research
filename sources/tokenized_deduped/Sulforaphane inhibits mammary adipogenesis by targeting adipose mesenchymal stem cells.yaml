- It is now well accepted that tumor cells actively communicate with the tumor microenvironment
  (e.g., adipocytes) leading to the progression of breast cancer and other malignancies.
- It is also known that adipose mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have the ability to
  differentiate into mature adipocytes and initiate cytokine signaling within the
  tumor microenvironment.
- Here, we examine the role of MSC-differentiated adipocytes on breast cancer cell
  migration, and test the effects of sulforaphane (SFN, a dietary chemoprevention
  agent) on adipocyte–breast cancer cell interaction.
- Our results demonstrate that SFN promotes MSC self-renewal and inhibits adipogenic
  differentiation.
- Subsequently, SFN treatment of adipocytes considerably hinders cytokine communication
  with breast cancer cells, thereby decreasing breast cancer cell migration and tumor
  formation.

  Adipocytes function to store reserves of nourishment in times of abundance, and
  to release these reserves in times of need.'
- This ability of adipose tissue to maintain the necessary amount of energy for use
  in metabolism is essential for the survival of any organism [1].
- Adipocytes differentiate from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in a process known as
  adipogenesis, and normally surround themselves with a network of other cell types
  that include fibroblasts, preadipocytic cells, endothelial cells, and immune cells
  [2].
- 'During adipogenesis, MSCs from adipose tissue proliferate and differentiate into
  lipid-assimilating cells in a two-stage process: the first stage being the commitment
  stage, in which MSCs commit to becoming preadipocytes, and the second stage being
  the terminal differentiation stage [2, 3].'
- During adipogenic competency and commitment, extracellular matrix (ECM) and cell
  shape remodeling play a role in coordinating various signaling cascades.
- Adipogenic commitment involves many key regulators that are modulated during the
  transition between MSCs and preadipocytes.
- These include OCT4, KLF4, and SOX family members, the latter of which are known
  to inhibit adipogenesis through SOX-mediated self-renewal signaling cascades [3,
  4].
- Terminal differentiation begins with the expression of two families of genes that
  encode the regulatory proteins CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) and the adipogenic
  key regulator, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) [5, 6].
- Adipogenic stimuli promote the downregulation of SOX9 and the increased expression
  of C/EBPß and C/EBPδ [7].
- Differentiated adipocytes can secrete a number of chemokines and cytokines that
  exert paracrine signaling in order to interact with the surrounding environment.
- Such communication between adipocytes and mammary epithelial cells promotes breast
  cancer progression [8, 9].
- Sulforaphane (SFN), a bioactive component found in broccoli, displays anti-inflammatory
  characteristics along with antioxidant activity and activation of apoptotic signaling
  pathways [10, 11].
- As such, the consumption of broccoli and other cruciferous vegetables provides the
  potential to lower cancer risk and incidence due to their antitumor effects.
- Although recent studies have shown that SFN can mediate lipolysis in adipocytes
  [12], not much is known about the role of SFN in the adipogenic differentiation
  of MSCs.
- We show here that the dietary compound, SFN can inhibit adipogenesis and suppress
  the interaction between adipocytes and breast cancer cells both in vitro and in
  vivo.
- Human adipose-derived MSCs (PCS-500-011) were obtained from American Type Culture
  Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA) and from the lipoaspirate of healthy humans following
  MSC enrichment [13].
- Cells were maintained in basal medium (PCS-500-030, ATCC) plus supplements (PCS-500-040,
  ATCC).
- Human mammary preadipocytes (mammary adipocyte precursor cells) were purchased from
  ZenBio (Research Triangle Park, NC).
- After confluence, the cells were placed in Adipocyte Differentiation Medium (#DM-2,
  ZenBio) to begin differentiation.
- After 7 days, the differentiated adipocytes were replaced with Adipocyte Maintenance
  Medium (#AM-1, ZenBio).
- Murine 3T3 L1 preadipocytes (ATCC) were cultured in high-glucose Dulbecco’s modified
  Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10 % bovine serum (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
  CA), penicillin, and streptomycin.
- The confluent 3T3 L1 preadipocytes were induced to differentiate using medium supplemented
  with 1 μg/ml bovine insulin, 1 μM dexamethasone, 0.5 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine
  (IBMX), 8 μg/ml biotin, and 10 % fetal bovine serum (FBS).

  prior to the staining, and then incubated with cells for 30 min at room temperature.
- Stained cells were washed two times with distilled water.
- Oil Red O-stained cells were visualized by Nikon Eclipse Ti-U microscope.
- To quantify the amount of Oil Red O-stained lipid droplets, stained cells were eluted
  with 100 % isopropyl alcohol for 10 min and the OD of the solution was measured
  at 500 nm in a microplate reader (Bio-Rad laboratories, Los Angeles, CA).
- Total RNA was extracted with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen).
- cDNA was synthesized from 2 μg of total RNA using moloney murine leukemia virus
  reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen).
- Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was carried out using a Light Cycler 480II
  (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN).
- Adipose-derived mescenchymal stem cells were separated using dissociation buffer
  (Millipore; Billerica, MA) and then seeded in six-well plates (5,000 cells/ml) coated
  with 2 % poly-hema (#P3932, Sigma).
- Spheres (&gt;50 μm) were counted as we previously described [14].
- After stimulation with adipocyte differentiation cocktail, human mammary preadipocytes
  differentiated into adipocytes.
- These adipocytes were cocultured with breast cancer cells (DCIS and PT) for 3 days.
- DCIS and PT cells were harvested for cell migration assays.
- In vitro migration assays were carried out in duplicate using transwell migration
  chambers (8 μm pore size, Costar, Cambridge, MA).
- DCIS and PT cells were seeded in the upper chamber, and the lower chamber was incubated
  with medium plus 10 % FBS.
- Migrated cells were stained with 1 % crystal violet in 40 % methanol/PBS and counted
  using microscopy.
- Screening for cytokines secreted from human adipocytes was performed by hybridizing
  conditioned medium with antibody-coated membranes (Cytokine Human Membrane Antibody
  Array kits, Abcam, Cambridge, MA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
- Briefly, human adipocytes were cultured with or without DCIS cells for 3 days.
- The culture supernatants were collected by centrifugation and then hybridized to
  the array membrane.
- A biotin-conjugated second antibody was used and cytokines were detected by HRP-conjugated
  streptavidin.
- Signals were quantified by UN-SCAN-IT gel 6.1 software (Silk Scientific, Orem, UT).
- DCIS cells (5 × 104) were seeded in the top chamber of the Transwell (0.4 μm pore
  size; Costar, Cambridge, MA).
- To evaluate the interaction of DCIS cells with adipocytes, DCIS cells were cocultured
  with human adipocytes (in the bottom chamber).
- After 3 days, DCIS cells were collected, washed twice with cold PBS, and then injected
  into mammary gland in 6–7 weeks old immunodeficient Nu/Nu female mice (Charles River
  Laboratories, Frederick, MD).
- Tumor growth was monitored weekly by caliper measurements (tumor size = (_L_ × _W_
  2) × 0.5)), where _L_ is the length and _W_ is the width of each tumor.
- Studies were conducted under animal protocols approved by the University of Maryland
  School of Medicine/Animal Care and Usage Committee (ACUC).
- Statistical analysis was performed with GraphPad Prism 6.0 software (GraphPad Software,
  Lo Jolla, CA).
- Data were assessed by Student’s_ t_ test with _P_ values of &lt;0.05 considered
  significant, unless stated otherwise.
- Adipocyte-rich microenvironment plays a vital role in tumor progression [15].
- It is known that adipocytes may function as endocrine cells by producing hormones,
  cytokines, and other growth factors, thus altering tumor cell behavior and promoting
  tumor progression [16].
- Since adipocytes differentiate from MSCs, we examined the impact of SFN on MSCs.
- MSCs were isolated from human adipose tissue and were allowed to differentiate into
  adipocytes [13].
- First, we employed a specific colony assay—a method relying on the formation of
  spheroids during suspension culture—to determine their in vitro capability of “self-renewal.”
  Sphere formation is a surrogate for stem cell growth and expansion, so we examined
  the impact of SFN treatment on sphere formation in MSCs.
- SFN treatment resulted in a statistically significant increase in sphere formation
  (Fig.
- 1A).
- It is now well accepted that expression levels of OCT4, KLF4, and SOX2 tightly control
  stem cell self-renewal and differentiation.
- MSCs were found to express these regulators whereas differentiated adipocyte cells
  express very low levels of these regulators [3, 4].
- OCT4, KLF4, and SOX2 were detectable by qRT-PCR in MSCs, whereas SFN-treated MSCs
  demonstrated remarkable OCT4, KLF4, and SOX2 over-expression (Fig.
- 1B).
- These data indicate that OCT4, KLF4, and SOX2 are important stem cell regulators
  in MSCs and that SFN treatment increases these regulators that control stem cell
  self-renewal pathways.
- SFN treatment increases self-renewal in adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells.
- A Adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were seeded on attachment-free 6-well
  plates.

  Having demonstrated a link between SFN treatment and regulation of stem cell regulators
  in MSCs, we next examined the impact of SFN modulation on stem cell differentiation
  properties.'
- We used human mammary preadipocytes to determine how SFN treatment alters adipocyte
  differentiation in vitro.
- In the presence of adipocyte differentiation cocktail for 14 days, these cells differentiated
  into mature adipocytes (Fig.
- 2A) associated with lipid accumulation (evidenced by Oil Red O staining), indicating
  that these stem cells (preadipocytes) can differentiate into mature human adipocytes
  in vitro.
- We then investigated if SFN may contribute to alterations of adipocyte differentiation.
- Preadipocytes were grown to confluence and then differentiated by adding hormone
  cocktail in the presence or absence of SFN.
- As shown in Fig.
- 2B, Oil Red O-stained cells were remarkably reduced in the presence of SFN treatment.
- Expression of adipocyte differentiation genes was examined by qRT-PCR analyses in
  SFN-treated and SFN-untreated cells.
- C/EBPα transcript levels were reduced in SFN-treated cells as compared with SFN-untreated
  cells, confirming that SFN inhibits preadipocyte differentiation to mature adipocytes.
- SFN treatment inhibits preadipocyte differentiation.

  Adipocytes have demonstrated the ability to stimulate tumor cell survival and invasiveness
  in vitro and in vivo [8, 9].'
- Since we observed that SFN treatment reduces MSC-directed differentiation, we next
  examined how SFN impacts a cross talk between adipocytes and tumor cells.
- Breast cancer cells (DCIS) were cocultured with human adipocytes.
- After 3 days, DCIS cells were trypsinized and migration assays were conducted in
  a medium containing 10 % FBS.
- As shown in Fig.
- 3A, DCIS cells previously cocultured with adipocytes showed an increase in cell
  migration as compared with uncocultured DCIS cells.
- This effect was not observed when DCIS cells were cocultured with undifferentiated
  preadipocytes (data not shown).
- Similar results were obtained with the SUM102PT(PT) cells.
- Therefore, these results indicate that mature adipocytes are able to stimulate the
  cell migration capacities of human breast cancer cells.
- When DCIS or PT cells were cocultured with adipocytes in the presence of SFN treatment,
  these tumor cell migration capacities were significantly decreased (Fig.
- 3A, B).
- These results highlight that a cross talk between the two cell populations is necessary
  to obtain this effect.
- Our results demonstrate that SFN treatment can reduce breast cancer cell migration
  in a cocultured adipocyte environment.
- Cocultures of breast cancer cells with human adipocytes enhances breast cancer cell
  migration capabilities.
- DCIS (A) or PT (B) cells were cultured with or without adipocytes.
- These cells were treated with or without 10 μM SFN.
- After 3 days of SFN treatment, DCIS or PT cells were trypsinized and collected for
  the cell migration assay.
- Migrated DCIS or PT cells were stained by crystal violet (_Left_, A and B).
- Cell migration was quantified (_Right_, A and B).
- Data were from three independent experiments (mean ± SEM).
- Scale bars are 100 μm.

  Our coculture experiments show that adipocytes stimulate breast cancer cell migration
  in vitro.'
- To identify factors responsible for promoting breast cancer cell migration, we searched
  for the growth factors/cytokines secreted by mature adipocytes, which exert critical
  functions in the formation of the tumor microenvironment.
- To define cytokines in human adipocytes, we performed human cytokine antibody arrays
  to examine the differential cytokine expression in conditioned media prepared from
  adipocytes alone or adipocytes cocultured with DCIS cells.
- The medium from adipocytes and adipocytes cocultured with DCIS cells were collected
  and the cytokine antibody arrays were used to detect the expression of 42 key cytokines
  simultaneously (Fig.
- 4A).
- Among 42 cytokines tested, the six cytokines most abundantly secreted by adipocytes
  cocultured with DCIS cells were GRO-α, ENA-78, IL-6, GRO, MCP-1, and IL-8 (2-fold
  cutoff, Fig.
- 4A, bottom).
- These cytokines have been known to exhibit both inflammatory and growth regulatory
  functions [17–19].
- These data suggest that the observed increase in pro-inflammatory molecules may
  contribute to changes in tumor cell migration in vitro.
- Adipocyte-DCIS cell coculture stimulates cytokine release and promotes tumor formation
  in vivo.
- A Cytokine expression was detected by a human cytokine antibody array.
- Conditioned medium was collected from human adipocytes alone or from DCIS cells
  cocultured with human adipocytes.
- Cytokines in conditioned medium were detected by a human cytokine antibody array.
- Signals were quantified and the cytokines most abundantly secreted by DCIS cells
  cocultured with human adipocytes were listed (2-fold cut off).
- _GRO and GROα_ growth-related cytokine superfamily, _ENA_78 epithelial neutrophil-activating
  protein 78, _IL-6 and IL-8_ interleukin 6 and 8, _MCP-1_ monocyte chemoattractant
  protein 1.
- B mRNA was collected from DCIS cocultured human adipocytes in the presence or absence
  of 10 μM SFN or SAHA treatment for 3 days.
- Levels of IL-6 mRNA were measured by qRT-PCR.
- Data were from three independent experiments (mean ± S.E.M).
- _P_ &lt; 0.05.
- C DCIS cells cocultured with human adipocytes were treated with or without 10 μM
  SFN.
- After 3 days of SFN treatment, DCIS cells were collected and then were injected
  into mammary glands.
- Tumor volume was measured weekly.
- The tumor volume results are presented as mean ± S.E.M.
- '_N_ = 5 mice/group


  Since IL-6 is of particular importance due to its inflammatory stimulation [20],
  we, therefore, quantified the mRNA expression levels of IL-6 in DCIS cells cocultured
  with human adipocytes.'
- We compared the effects of treatment with SFN (a dietary histone deacetylase (HDAC)
  inhibitor) or SAHA (a pharmacological HDAC inhibitor) on levels of IL-6 mRNA (Fig.
- 4B).
- We observed a significant reduction of IL-6 mRNA with both treatments, although
  the effect of SAHA treatment was even more intensive.
- Since DCIS cocultured with adipocytes showed more aggressive phenotypes in regards
  to migration (Fig.
- 3A), we decided to determine if coculture of breast cancer cells with adipocytes
  will promote tumor growth in vivo.
- After 3 days of coculture of DCIS cells with human dipocytes, DCIS cells were collected
  and then injected into mammary gland in 6–7-week-old immunodeficient Nu/Nu female
  mice.
- DCIS cells cocultured with adipocytes remarkably increased the tumor volume compared
  with uncocultured DCIS cells after injection into mice (Fig.
- 4C).
- In addition, although the tumors were still present when cocultured DCIS cells were
  treated with SFN, the volumes of tumors were much lower than those from untreated
  DCIS cells at each time point under examination.
- In particular, tumor growth was halted after 4 weeks with SFN interference.
- Therefore, our results strongly support that SFN treatment can suppress adipocyte-associated
  breast cancer growth in vivo.
- The results of these experiments provide insight into the mechanisms underlying
  the SFN chemoprevention in breast cancer.
- We examined the impact of SFN on the self-renewing properties of adipose-derived
  MSCs by studying spheroid formation, which is a surrogate for stem cell growth and
  expansion.
- We also compared the mRNA transcript levels of genes involved in MSC self-renewal
  (i.e., OCT4, KLF4, and SOX2) between control and SFN-treated cells.
- We found that SFN treatment results in a significantly increase in spheroid formation
  of MSCs and remarkable over-expression of OCT4, KLF4, and SOX2 mRNA levels when
  compared to untreated cells.
- These results indicate that SFN treatment increases stem cell self-renewal through
  the upregulation of self-renewing genes.
- Next, we examined the effects of SFN treatment on the differentiation potential
  of preadipocytes.
- We compared lipid droplet formation between SFN-treated and SFN-untreated cells
  using Oil Red O staining, and assessed the mRNA transcript levels of genes (i.e.,
  C/EBPα) involved in the differentiation process of both SFN-treated and SFN-untreated
  cells.
- From these experiments, we observed a significant reduction of Oil Red O staining
  as well as a decrease in C/EBPα transcript levels in SFN-treated cells compared
  to untreated cells.
- These results confirm that SFN inhibits MSC differentiation to mature adipocytes.
- We performed coculture of adipocytes with breast cancer cells (DCIS and PT) to determine
  if adipocytes impact tumor cell migration in vitro.
- In our coculture experiments without SFN treatment, we found that adipocytes can
  increase DCIS and PT cell migration.
- Both DCIS and PT cells exhibited a remarkable reduction of cell migration capacities
  in the presence of SFN treatment.
- These findings highlight a mechanism of cross talking between the two cell populations
  that is sensitive to SFN intervention.
- We further explored this cell-to-cell communication between breast cancer cells
  and adipocytes through specific growth factors/cytokines that may be responsible
  for signaling within the tumor microenvironment.
- Using cytokine antibody arrays, we found a remarkable increase in the expression
  of several cytokines (including IL-6 and IL-8) in DCIS cells cocultured with adipocytes.
- mRNA levels of IL-6 in cocultured DCIS were remarkably reduced in the presence of
  SFN or SAHA.
- After confirming that SFN treatment inhibits breast cancer cell migration and IL-6
  mRNA in cocultured experiments, we examined the impact of SFN treatment on breast
  cancer formation in a mouse model.
- After injection of DCIS cells cocultured with adipocytes into mice, we observed
  that adipocyte–DCIS cell coculture leads to a dramatic increase in tumor formation.
- Finally, when adipocyte–DCIS cell coculture was treated with SFN, we observed a
  reduction of tumor volume and inhibition of tumor growth after 4 weeks of SFN intervention.
- These results demonstrate the antitumor activity of SFN in vivo.
- SFN represents a prime example of a cancer-preventive compound that can significantly
  hinder tumor development through intervention of the tumor microenvironment.
- Considering its low toxicity, SFN represents a very ideal candidate for the prevention
  of the early-stage breast cancer.
- Indeed, further studies are required to determine the subtype and stage of breast
  cancer to target.
