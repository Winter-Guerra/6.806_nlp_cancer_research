- Many studies have found links between diet and cancer.
- The summary estimates of the association between dietary factors and cancer risk
  were investigated using previously reported studies of the Korean population.
- 'Gastric cancer risk was inversely associated with the high intake of soy foods
  [OR (95% CI): 0.32 (0.25-0.40) for soybean, 0.56 (0.45-0.71) for soybean curd, and
  0.67 (0.46-0.98) for soymilk], allium vegetables [OR (95% CI): 0.37 (0.26-0.53)
  for green onion, 0.54 (0.40-0.73) for garlic, and 0.54 (0.35-0.85) for onion], fruits
  [OR (95% CI): 0.61 (0.42-0.88)], and mushrooms [OR (95% CI): 0.43 (0.21-0.88)].'
- 'Salt and Kimchi were associated with an increased gastric cancer risk [OR (95%
  CI): 1.92 (1.52-2.43) and 2.21 (1.29-3.77), respectively].'
- 'Colorectal cancer risk was positively associated with meat intake [OR (95% CI):
  1.25 (1.15-1.36)].'
- 'Total soy products, soybean curd, and soymilk showed an inverse association with
  breast cancer risk [OR (95% CI): 0.61 (0.38-0.99), 0.47 (0.34-0.66), and 0.75 (0.57-0.98),
  respectively].'
- 'Green/yellow and light colored vegetables were associated with a reduced risk of
  breast cancer [OR (95% CI): 0.34 (0.23-0.49) and 0.44 (0.21-0.90), respectively].'
- 'Mushroom intake was inversely associated in pre-menopausal women only [OR (95%
  CI): 0.47 (0.26-0.86)].'
- In conclusion, soy foods, fruits and vegetables might reduce cancer risk in the
  Korean population.
- High salt food might be risk factor for gastric cancer, and intake of high amount
  of meat might cause colorectal cancer.
