- Some studies suggest a favorable role of antioxidants on breast cancer risk but
  this is still inconclusive.
- The aim of this study was to assess whether overall dietary antioxidant capacity,
  as assessed by dietary ferric reducing antioxidant potential (FRAP), and individual
  dietary antioxidant intake were associated with breast cancer risk.
- Data was used from women participating in the Rotterdam Study, a prospective cohort
  study among subjects aged 55 years and older (_N_ = 3,209).
- FRAP scores and antioxidant intake (_i.e_., vitamin A, C, E, selenium, flavonoids
  and carotenoids) was assessed at baseline by a food frequency questionnaire.
- Incident cases of breast cancer were confirmed through medical reports.
- During a median follow-up of 17 years, 199 cases with breast cancer were identified.
- 'High dietary FRAP score was associated with a lower risk of breast cancer [hazard
  ratio (HR): 0.68; 95% confidence intervals (CI): 0.49, 0.96].'
- No overall association between individual antioxidant intake and breast cancer risk
  was found.
- 'However, low intake of alpha carotene and beta carotene was associated with a higher
  risk of breast cancer among smokers (HR: 2.48; 95% CI: 1.21, 5.12 and HR: 2.31;
  95% CI: 1.12, 4.76 for alpha and beta carotene, respectively) and low intake of
  flavonoids was associated with breast cancer risk in women over the age of 70 (HR:
  1.80; 95% CI: 1.09, 2.99).'
- These results suggest that high overall dietary antioxidant capacity is associated
  with a lower risk of breast cancer.
- Individual effects of dietary carotenoids and dietary flavonoids may be restricted
  to subgroups such as smokers and elderly.
- The incidence of breast cancer cases is increasing worldwide; predominantly in high-income
  countries.
- '[1, 2] Worldwide, it has been estimated that 1.38 million new cases were diagnosed
  in 2008 which accounts for 23% of all diagnosed cancers among women.'
- '[3]


  Several risk factors for breast cancer have been identified such as family history
  of breast cancer, reproductive history, the absence of breastfeeding, weight gain,
  moderate alcohol consumption and postmenopausal hormone therapy.'
- '[1, 2, 4]


  Dietary factors might also contribute to breast cancer prevention.'
- For instance, experimental studies _in vitro_ suggest that high antioxidant intake
  may reduce the risk of developing cancer.
- '[5] However, observational studies on antioxidant status and the risk of breast
  cancer show inconsistent results.'
- '[6, 7] In addition, case control studies have found that fruits and vegetable intake
  are associated with a reduced breast cancer risk which may be due to high intake
  of antioxidants.'
- '[8, 9] However, the European Prospective Investigation on Cancer (EPIC cohort)
  did not find any prospective association between fruit and vegetable intake and
  breast cancer risk across Europe.'
- '[10] In addition, the World Cancer Research Fund/American Institute for Cancer
  Research has concluded that the overall evidence for fruit, vegetables and antioxidants
  and breast cancer risk is still too limited.'
- '[1, 2]


  So far, studies mainly focused on evaluating the contribution of individual factors
  to breast cancer risk and did not take into account the overall diet or the contribution
  of multiple elements to an overall antioxidant effect which may have contributed
  to the contradictory results.'
- Measuring the "total antioxidant capacity of the diet" is a challenge and different
  alternatives have been explored which show similar ranking of foods according to
  their antioxidant capacity.
- '[11] The ferric reducing antioxidant potential (FRAP) measures the antioxidant
  capacity of the diet by measuring the reduction of ferric ion to ferrous ion which
  can be a useful marker to capture overall effects of antioxidants according to dietary
  components[12] instead of individual effects of foods or antioxidants.'
- In addition, previous studies have suggested that iron can induce oxidative stress
  that may influence mammary carcinogenesis[13] but whether a more complete measurement
  of the antioxidant capacity of the diet, as assessed by FRAP, would provide a more
  relevant effect in terms of prevention of breast cancer remains unclear.
- Therefore, the primary objective of our study was to assess whether FRAP was associated
  with the risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal women.
- A second aim was to assess whether individual dietary antioxidant intake was associated
  with breast cancer risk.
- The present analyses were performed in the Rotterdam Study, a population-based prospective
  cohort study which has been described in detail previously.
- '[14] We used data from the first cohort of the Rotterdam Study which consists of
  7,983 persons living in the Ommoord district in Rotterdam, The Netherlands.'
- All subjects were above the age of 55 years and have been recruited between July
  1989 and September 1993.
- '[14] The participants first underwent an interview at home and an extensive physical
  examination in the research center.'
- These examinations were repeated every 3-4 years.
- Dietary intake was evaluated at baseline examination by using a two step-protocol,
  in order to minimize the loss of information in dietary reporting in an older population.
- During the home interview, subjects were provided with a meal-based checklist to
  indicate the foods they had consumed at least twice per month in the previous year.
- Subsequently, a dietary interview was performed at the research center by using
  a validated semiquantitative food-frequency questionnaire (SFFQ).
- '[15] The SFFQ was designed to measure ''typical'' diet by asking questions about
  the frequency and amount of food consumption.'
- It consisted of 170 food items.
- Frequency of food intake was recorded in times per day, week or month, and serving
  sizes were specified in standardized units, household measures, or grams.
- Data from the SFFQ were then analysed and transformed into macronutrient and antioxidant
  intake using the Dutch Food Composition Table.
- '[16]


  Nutrient intake from the SFFQ was validated against a 15 days food diary of food
  recording over a 1-year period.'
- '[15] Pearson correlation after adjustment for age, sex, energy and within-person
  variation were between 0.44 and 0.85 for macro and micronutrients as described in
  detail previously.'
- '[15]




  To assess dietary antioxidant capacity from the SFFQ, each food''s contribution
  to FRAP was calculated on the basis of the Antioxidant Food Table published by the
  Institute of Nutrition Research, University of Oslo, which includes measurements
  of &gt;3,000 foods.'
- '[17] Based on a modified version of the FRAP assay to assess the antioxidant capacity
  of individual food items by measuring the ability of antioxidants in food items
  to reduce ferric iron (Fe3+) to ferrous iron (Fe2+).'
- '[12] Since this food table consisted of foods from several manufacturers, we consulted
  nutritional experts at Wageningen University (the Netherlands) to determine linkage
  of foods from several manufacturers that were the closest to the Dutch food products.'
- For each participant, we multiplied the consumption frequency of each food by the
  corresponding FRAP value (in mmol/100g), and summed these values across all dietary
  sources.
- Detailed data on vitamin supplementation was not available, and, therefore, not
  included in the FRAP assessment.
- Most variation in dietary FRAP scores was explained by intakes of coffee (65%) and
  tea (21%).
- 'As it had been suggested that this FRAP table is best suited for ranking individuals
  than using the exact values,[17] FRAP was analyzed after stratification into tertiles
  of the total population of analysis (Tertile 1: ≤ 18.00 mmol/day, tertile 2: 18.01-22.25
  mmol/day and tertile 3: ≥22.26 mmol/day).'
- 'Additionally, we assessed the dietary intake of the following individual antioxidants:
  vitamin A, C, E, selenium, flavonoids, alpha and beta carotene, lutein, zeaxanthine,
  beta cryptoxanthin and lycopene.'
- These have been suggested to be potentially related to cancer risk.
- '[1]




  The diagnoses of breast cancer were obtained through the general practitioners and
  by linkage with a nationwide registry of histo and cytopathology in the Netherlands
  (PALGA).'
- Two research physicians independently assessed the first date and diagnosis of breast
  cancer.
- All events were coded according to the International Classification of Diseases
  (ICD-10 code C50).
- In case of discrepancy, consensus was sought, or a cancer epidemiologist decided.
- Data on breast cancer incidence was available until December 2010.
- At baseline of the Rotterdam Study, during the home interview the participants provided
  information about socioeconomic background, demographics and lifestyle habits.
- Weight and height were measured at first visit at the study center.
- 'Household income was categorized into two categories: low to intermediate (net
  income less than 1,090 euro per month) and intermediate to high income (net income
  more than 1,090 euro per month).'
- 'Educational level was categorized into two categories: lower education (primary
  school) and higher education (secondary education and higher).'
- 'Smoking status was categorized into three categories: (_i_) never smoked, (_ii_)
  former smoker, (_iii_) current smoker.'
- 'Alcohol consumption was categorized into four categories: (_i_) less than one drink
  per week, (_ii_) one drink per week, (_iii_) two drinks per week and (_iv_) three
  or more drinks per week.'
- Family history of breast cancer, menopausal hormone therapy and multivitamin use
  were categorized into dichotomous variables (yes _vs_.
- no).
- Reproductive history was categorized into three categories as having no children,
  having one to four children and having more than four children.
- 'Body mass index (BMI) (kg/m2) was categorized into four categories: underweight
  (&lt;18.5), normal BMI (18.5-24.9), overweight (25-29.9) and obese (≥30).'
- Comorbidities at baseline were defined as any history of cardiometabolic diseases
  such as diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular outcomes.
- The characteristics of the population within the Rotterdam Study have been described
  previously.
- '[14] For our analysis, we used a population of 7,983 participants (_n_ = 7,983)
  and excluded men (_n_ = 3,105, 38.9%) and women with a history of breast cancer
  (_n_ = 1).'
- The remaining population were 4,877 women over the age of 55 years old.
- In addition to this, we excluded 1,668 (38.1%) women without dietary data.
- 'Dietary data was missing when: (_i_) Individuals were included during the pilot
  phase of the study (between 1989 and 1990), (_ii_) Individuals were institutionalized
  and (_iii_) The research dietician considered the dietary data unreliable when subjects
  had difficulties with recall of their food intake or when dementia was suspected.'
- The final population that was analyzed consisted of 3,209 women of whom 199 (6.3%)
  developed breast cancer during follow-up (Fig.
- 1).
- First, we used Chi-square-test for the categorical variables to study whether there
  were any differences in characteristics between subjects with different FRAP intake.
- Continuous variables were analyzed by using one-way ANOVA test.
- Subsequently, crude and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models were performed
  to evaluate the association between dietary FRAP score, dietary antioxidant intake
  (per individual item) and breast cancer risk.
- 'Dietary FRAP score was analyzed as continuous variable and as categorical variable
  after stratification into tertiles (low: ≤ 18.00 mmol/day, medium: 18.01-22.25 mmol/day
  and high: ≥22.26 mmol/day).'
- Dietary FRAP and dietary antioxidant intake were adjusted for total energy intake
  by using the residual method.
- '[18] The crude model was adjusted for age.'
- 'Subsequently, in the multivariate model we adjusted for the following potential
  confounders: BMI, educational level, household income, family history of breast
  cancer, smoking status, alcohol consumption, dietary fat intake, dietary fiber intake,
  reproductive history, comorbidities to baseline and hormone and multivitamin use.'
- To evaluate potential confounding, these variables were stepwise added to the crude
  model.
- When the effect estimate changed by more than 10%, the variable was kept in the
  final multivariate model.
- '[19] To evaluate potential effect modification, interaction was tested by smoking
  status, alcohol intake, BMI and age in the final multivariate model.'
- Stratified analyses by median values were performed when _p_-value for interaction
  was less than 0.10.
- To reduce potential bias associated with missing data, a multiple imputation procedure
  of missing data was performed[20] (_N_ = 5 imputations; Supporting Information Tables
  1 and 2).
- To prevent potential reverse causality, sensitivity analysis was performed by excluding
  all breast cancer cases that occurred in the first 24 months of the follow up time.
- Also, sensitivity analysis was performed after excluding subjects with any use of
  supplementation.
- Results are presented as hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).
- A _p-_value of 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.
- Analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics 21 (SPSS, version 21.0; SPSS,
  Chicago, IL).
- A total of 199 breast cancer cases were diagnosed in the total population during
  a median (range; minimum, maximum) follow-up time of 17 (0-22) years.
- Baseline characteristics of the population are presented in Table 1.
- Age was significantly lower when dietary FRAP was higher and subjects with high
  dietary FRAP were more often no alcohol drinker or no smoker and had less often
  comorbidities at baseline (Table 1).
- 'Subjects with moderate and high dietary FRAP at baseline (≥18.01 mmol/day) had
  a lower risk of developing breast cancer during follow-up when compared to subjects
  with low dietary FRAP (≤18.00 mmol/day) after adjustment for potential confounders
  (HRhigh _vs._ low: 0.68; 95% CI: 0.49, 0.96) (HRmedium _vs._ low: 0.71; 95% CI:
  0.51, 0.99) (Table 2).'
- Additional adjustment for hormone use, reproductive history and dietary fat and
  fiber intake did not alter these effect estimates.
- High selenium intake was associated with a higher risk of breast cancer but this
  was mainly explained by confounders (Table 3).
- Other individual dietary antioxidant intake were not significantly associated with
  the risk of breast cancer (Table 3).
- No effect modification by smoking status, alcohol intake, BMI or age was found for
  the association between dietary FRAP and breast cancer.
- (_p_-interaction &gt; 0.10; stratified analyses not shown).
- However, a statistically significant interaction between carotenoids intake and
  smoking status on breast cancer risk was found (_p_-interaction = 0.04).
- 'Low intake of alpha carotene and beta carotene (below the median) was associated
  with a higher risk of breast cancer among smokers (HRalpha-carotene: 2.48; 95% CI:
  1.21, 5.12) (HRbeta-carotene: 2.31; 95% CI: 1.12, 4.76) (Table 4).'
- Also, significant interaction between flavonoids intake and age was found _(p_-interaction
  = 0.02_)_.
- 'Subjects of 70 years and older who had a low intake of flavonoids (below the median)
  had a higher risk of breast cancer (HR: 1.80; 95% CI: 1.09, 2.99) (Table 4).'
- Additional sensitivity analysis showed similar effect estimates for all other analyses
  after excluding breast cancer cases that occurred within 24 first months of follow-up
  and after excluding subjects that used any supplementation (data not shown).
- Also, results after the multiple imputation procedure did not differ from the original
  data (data not shown).
- In this study, we found that high dietary antioxidant capacity, as assessed by FRAP,
  was associated with a decreased risk of breast cancer.
- Individual antioxidants were not significantly associated with the risk of breast
  cancer with the exception of the association in specific subgroups.
- These results suggest that the association between dietary antioxidants and breast
  cancer risk may be restricted to the overall antioxidant capacity of a diet to which
  multiple individual antioxidant components contribute.
- To our knowledge, few studies focused on the influence of overall antioxidant capacity
  as measured by FRAP rather than individual contributions of food items and the risk
  of breast cancer.
- Nevertheless, the concept that overall dietary antioxidant capacity may play a role
  in cancer development has been suggested earlier.
- In addition, a case control study assessed the association between the urine levels
  of advanced oxidative protein products, hydrogen peroxide, malondialdehyde and FRAP
  with breast cancer.
- The authors found that FRAP was statistically significantly lower in breast cancer
  cases.
- '[21] However, another case control study could not confirm this.'
- '[13] Laboratory-based experimental studies also have suggested that a complex mixture
  of antioxidants present in whole foods may be more effective than isolated antioxidants
  in cancer development.'
- For example, Faria _et al_.
- '[22] showed that antioxidant capacity inhibits growth of breast cancer cells.'
- Wang _et al_.
- '[23] showed that plant-based foods (_i.e_., fruits, vegetables and legumes) can
  be strong inhibitors of human breast cancer cells (MCF-7) and evidence was found
  for synergistic and antagonistic antioxidant capacity of multiple foods.'
- '[23] However, the authors did not find evidence that the interactive antioxidant
  capacity had antiproliferative effects on breast cancer cells.'
- '[23]


  Oxidative DNA damage is one of the most commonly proposed pathway leading to carcinogenesis[24,
  25] which is strongly determined by body iron storage.'
- '[25] In our population, coffee and tea were the major contributors of dietary FRAP.'
- Coffee and tea may inhibit iron absorption in the small intestine and thereby decreasing
  oxidative stress through reducing body iron storage.
- '[26] In line with this, it has been recently confirmed that coffee but not tea
  was associated with lower levels of oxidative DNA damage and decreased body iron
  storage in women.'
- '[27] However, results on coffee and tea consumption on breast cancer risk are still
  inconsistent.'
- '[28-31] Hence, further study on how dietary FRAP influence breast cancer development
  is required.'
- Our results on the individual antioxidants are in line with some previous large
  scale studies on breast cancer and dietary antioxidant intake.
- The EPIC study found no overall association between dietary beta carotene, flavonoids,
  vitamin C and vitamin E intake and breast cancer risk, but it was suggested that
  there may be an inverse trend between antioxidant compounds (lignans) and ER negative
  tumors.
- '[32, 33] Also, the Swedish Mammography Screening Cohort found no association between
  beta carotene, retinol, vitamin C and E intake and breast cancer risk but results
  indicated a protective role of vitamin C in women who were overweight.'
- '[34] However, we could not confirm this in our study (_p-_value for interaction
  by BMI &gt;0.10).'
- Interestingly, the Nurses' Health Study found an inverse association between dietary
  beta carotene, lutein, zeaxanthine, vitamin A and breast cancer risk in post and
  premenopausal women[35] but this was not confirmed by the Iowa Women's Health Study.
- '[36]


  Our results on dietary carotenoids intake and breast cancer risk among smokers are
  in line with results from the Swedish Mammography Screening Cohort who found no
  overall association with dietary carotenoids intake and breast cancer risk but they
  found a decreased risk of breast cancer in smokers with high intake of alpha carotene
  and beta carotene.'
- '[37] Additionally, a meta-analysis of eight prospective studies found the same
  trend for total carotenoids serum levels in current smokers.'
- '[38] Similarly, the Nurses'' Health Study reported that there was no association
  between dietary intake of carotenoids and other antioxidants and breast cancer but
  they also suggested that high intake of vitamin A may be related to reduced risk
  of breast cancer among smokers.'
- '[39] Low intake of carotenoids in smokers may increase the risk of breast cancer
  due to increased oxidative stress by both risk factors as the interplay between
  carotenoids and smoking has been described earlier.'
- '[40] In addition, it has been suggested that cigarette smoke can alter carotenoids
  status in both blood and tissues by increased metabolic turnover of the carotenoids
  and modification of carotenoid compounds.'
- '[40] Nevertheless, in a large scale case control study conducted among Hispanic
  and non-Hispanic women no effect modification was found by smoking on breast cancer
  risk.'
- '[41] Hence, the relationship between smoking, dietary carotenoids intake and breast
  cancer risk needs further clarification.'
- Finally, we found that low dietary flavonoids intake was associated with breast
  cancer risk in people over 70 years old.
- This has not been found in earlier studies but may be explained by an additive or
  synergistic effect of low flavonoid intake and age.
- These mechanisms, which are proposed from animal studies, may be related to DNA
  damaging through oxidative stress or by altering cell signal transduction.
- '[42] Flavonoids have been shown to have a variety of both anticancer and antiageing
  effects including reducing oxidative stress by regulating redox state, regulating
  cell growth and protein homeostasis through the target-of-rapamycin (TOR) pathway
  and insulin/IGF-1-like signaling.'
- '[42] We speculate that the aging process combined with low dietary flavonoids intake
  may alter these latter biological processes that may increase breast cancer risk
  especially in elderly subjects.'
- A strength of this study is the prospective study design minimizing recall bias
  associated with breast cancer diagnosis and the large study population drawn from
  the _general population enhancing the external validity of the results_.
- Also, the use of FRAP enables us to assess the overall effect of antioxidant power
  instead of individual effects of antioxidants and is a novel approach in studying
  the relationship between dietary antioxidants and breast cancer.
- However, to appreciate the results some limitations of this study need to be considered.
- We used a SFFQ to assess dietary antioxidant intake.
- As a result, measurement error in dietary intake may still be present.
- Although adjustment for total energy can reduce the magnitude of measurement errors,
  random error may have diluted our results on individual dietary antioxidant intake.
- In addition, a meta-analysis showed that there may be a protective effect of high
  levels of beta carotene when assessed from blood levels but not when assessed from
  diet.
- '[6] Unfortunately, no biomarker data on antioxidant status was available in our
  study to strengthen our conclusions.'
- Also, we did not have detailed data on vitamin supplementation which may contribute
  to overall FRAP.
- Nevertheless, only when supplement use would be related to breast cancer risk our
  HR may be underestimated.
- Although we adjusted our analyses for any supplement use, a very recent study has
  shown that supplement use is unrelated to breast cancer risk among 32,665 middle-aged
  women in the UK Women's Cohort Study.
- '[43] In addition, excluding subjects using any supplementation did not alter our
  results.'
- Hence, it may be unlikely that an underestimation of FRAP by excluding supplements
  in the assessment have led to invalid conclusions in our study population.
- It has been discussed that methods assessing antioxidant capacity of plasma are
  of limited use for identifying antioxidant mechanisms as there is not a direct relationship
  between the antioxidant content of a food and the subsequent cellular antioxidant
  activity.
- '[44] The scope of this study, however, was to assess whether ranking of the overall
  dietary antioxidant capacity on the basis of FRAP is associated with breast cancer
  risk and not to identify specific antioxidant mechanisms that may play a role in
  the development of breast cancer.'
- Additionally, physical activity levels were not measured at baseline and physical
  activity might be associated with a decreased risk of breast cancer[45] which may
  lead to residual confounding.
- Also, data expression of estrogen receptors and progesterone receptors in tumors
  were not available, whereas it has been reported that effects of diet may be different
  according to these tumor properties.
- '[46]


  In conclusion, the results of this study indicate that high overall dietary antioxidant
  capacity is associated with a decreased risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal
  women.'
- Individual antioxidants are not associated with overall breast cancer risk emphasizing
  the need of appraising antioxidant dietary levels and contribution as a whole rather
  than evaluating individual effects.
- Additional studies are needed to gain further insight into the influence of antioxidant
  capacity and dietary antioxidants and the risk of breast cancer in specific subgroups
  such as smokers and elderly aged 70 years and older.
- All funding sources had no role in design and conduct of this manuscript; collection,
  management, analysis, and interpretation of the data; and preparation, review or
  approval of this manuscript.
