- Resistance to endocrine therapy is a major impediment to successful treatment of
  breast cancer.
- Preclinical and clinical evidence links resistance to antiestrogen drugs in breast
  cancer cells with the overexpression and/or activation of various pro-oncogenic
  tyrosine kinases.
- Disruption of circadian rhythms by night shift work or disturbed sleep-wake cycles
  may lead to an increased risk of breast cancer and other diseases.
- Moreover, light exposure at night (LEN) suppresses the nocturnal production of melatonin
  that inhibits breast cancer growth.
- In this study, we used a rat model of estrogen receptor (ERα+) MCF-7 tumor xenografts
  to demonstrate how altering light/dark cycles with dim LEN (dLEN) speed the development
  of breast tumors, increasing their metabolism and growth and conferring an intrinsic
  resistance to tamoxifen therapy.
- These characteristics were not observed in animals in which the circadian melatonin
  rhythm was not disrupted, or in animals subjected to dLEN if they received nocturnal
  melatonin replacement.
- Strikingly, our results also showed that melatonin acted both as a tumor metabolic
  inhibitor and a circadian-regulated kinase inhibitor to reestablish the sensitivity
  of breast tumors to tamoxifen and tumor regression.
- Together, our findings show how dLEN-mediated disturbances in nocturnal melatonin
  production can render tumors insensitive to tamoxifen.
