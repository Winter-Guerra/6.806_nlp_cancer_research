- Consumption of apples has been linked to the prevention of various chronic diseases,
  including tumors and cardiovascular diseases.
- The apple total triterpenoid content (ATT) was extracted and concentrated from apple
  peels.
- The in vitro and in vivo antitumor activities, related antitumor mechanisms, were
  investigated.
- In vitro, ATT showed potent antiproliferative activities against human breast cancer
  (MCF-7, MDA-MB-231), human colon cancer (Caco-2), and human liver cancer (HepG2)
  cell lines.
- In vivo antitumor experiments showed that ATT could substantially reduce the occurrence
  and growth of mammary tumor with a good dose-dependent manner in a rat model.
- During the apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells induced by ATT, the caspase-independent
  pathway was involved in the process of apoptosis, and the mitochondrial transmembrane
  potential was markedly reduced.
- Also the PI3K/Akt/NF-κB pathway was activated.
- These results indicated that ATT-induced apoptosis of MDA-MB-231 cells may involve
  a mitochondrial-related pathway.

  Apples (_Malus pumila_) play a very significant part in the diet of humans.'
- Consumption of apples has been linked to the prevention of various chronic diseases.
- (1) Apple intake can reduce mammary tumor incidence and growth,(2) lung cancer incidence,(3,
  4)cardiovascular disease,(5) symptoms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,(6)
  and the risk of thrombotic stroke.
- (7) Meanwhile, apple extracts have been shown to have potent antioxidant and antiproliferative
  activity against human tumor cells.
- (8) Apple peels exhibited lipase-inhibitory activity, which may be linked to the
  ursenoic acid content.
- Furthermore, both triterpenoid content and lipase-inhibitory activity varied by
  cultivar.
- '(9)


  In our previous study, the bioactive compounds of apple peels were investigated,
  and it was found that the triterpenoids may be responsible for apple’s anticancer
  activity.'
- (10, 11) There were 22 triterpenoids isolated and identified from the peels of red
  delicious apple.
- Ursanes and oleananes were the two classes of triterpenoids found in apple.
- Ursolic acid (UA) was the main and active constituent among the total triterpenoids.

  Apoptosis is a form of programmed cell death involving a biochemical cascade.'
- It is also necessary for the destruction of cells considered a threat such as cells
  infected with viruses, cells with DNA damage, and cancerous cells.
- Impaired regulation of apoptosis leads to a variety of diseases.
- 'The progress of apoptosis is regulated by a series of signal cascades under certain
  circumstances: internal and external signals.'
- Internal damage to a cell, such as oxidative damage, causes Bcl-2 to activate Bax,
  which creates holes in the mitochondrial membrane.
- These holes allow the entry of cytochrome _c_ into the cytoplasm.
- Cytochrome _c_ binds to Apaf-1 forming complexes that aggregate to form apoptosomes.
- The apoptosomes activate caspases.
- These executioner caspases activate a cascade of proteolytic activity that leads
  to the digestion of structural proteins, DNA degradation.
- For external signals, FasL and TNF-alpha/beta can bind to the cell membrane receptors
  Fas and TNF, respectively.
- Binding of the Fas or TNF ligands results in the activation of caspase-8, which
  unleashes a proteolytic cascade similar to that activated by caspase-9.
- Fas ligand (FasL) has been well characterized as a death factor.
- The death domain of Fas, FADD, and caspase-8 were required for NF-κB activation
  by FasL.
- (12) FasL is a critical downstream effector of p53-dependent apoptosis.
- (13, 14) This cascade results in phagocytosis of the cell.
- However, recent evidence for FasL-independent activation of Fas suggests that the
  death receptor can also be activated intracellularly, in the absence of its ligand.
- (15) The caspase-cascade system plays vital roles in the induction, transduction
  and amplification of intracellular apoptotic signals.

- (18) PI3K/Akt constitutes an important pathway regulating the signaling of multiple
  biological processes such as apoptosis, metabolism, cell proliferation, and cell
  growth.

  over the course of study.
- '(23)


  After 12 weeks of DMBA administration, the mammary carcinomas of rats were confirmed
  by histological examination and breast palpation for continuing experiments.'
- The tumor bearing rats were divided initially into five groups, namely, control
  group, ATT groups (25, 50, 100 mg/kg), and cisplatin group (10 mg/kg).
- Each group had 10 rats.
- ATT was dissolved in glycerin (5.0 mg/mL).

- The cells were then harvested, washed with cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS),
  and processed for cell cycle analysis.
- (24) Briefly, the cells were centrifuged, washed in PBS, and fixed in cold 70% ethanol
  for at least 24 h, and then they were stained with a PI solution (20 mg/L propidium

  Experimental values are expressed as mean ± SD.'
- Comparison of mean values between various groups was performed by one-way analysis
  of variance followed by multiple comparisons using the Tukey test.
- _P_ value &lt;0.05 is considered to be significant.
- After concentration using a D101 macroporus resin column, the total triterpenoid
  content in ATT was 93.0 ± 4.2% as measured by the colorimetric method.
- In ATT, the contents of ursolic acid (UA) and oleanolic acid (OA) were 43.5 ± 1.3%
  and 6.5 ± 1.5%, respectively, determined by HPLC (the HPLC profile was shown in
  Figure 1).
- The apple total triterpenoids (ATT) was used for bioactivity study.
- The antiproliferative activity of apple peel 95% ethanol extract (AP), apple total
  triterpenoids (ATT), ursolic acid (UA), and oleanolic acid (OA) was evaluated by
  MTT assay.
- Their antiproliferative activities are given in Table 1.
- AP, ATT, UA, and OA showed potent antiproliferative activities against all four
  cancer cells, especially to human breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231).
- ATT showed the highest antiproliferative activity toward MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells,
  for which the IC50 values were 5.3 ± 0.8 and 4.7 ± 0.6 mg/L, respectively.
- Generally, ATT showed the highest antiproliferative activity against the four cells,
  compared to AP and its two main active constituents, UA and OA.
- Table 1.
- "IC50 Values for the Inhibition of Human Tumor Cells of AP, ATT, UA, and OA (Mean
  ± SD, _n_ = 8)  \n\n\n\nATT was evaluated for in vivo antimammary tumor activity,
  since it showed significant antiproliferative activity against breast tumor cell
  lines (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) in vitro."
- The in vivo antimammary tumor results are given in Figure 2.
- It is shown that ATT could reduce mammary tumor in a rat model.
- The total cumulative weight of observable mammary tumors in the group of ATT was
  substantially lower compared to control group (_p_ &lt; 0.001), which also showed
  a strong dose–response trend.
- Meanwhile, the body weights of rats had a slight change after the treatment with
  ATT, which was quite different from the cisplatin group (Table 2).
- Figure 2.
- The total cumulative weight of observable mammary tumors of each group at the 20th
  day of the first treatment (mean ± SD, _n_ = 10).

- "Change in Body Weight of Rats after Different Treatments between the 1st and 20th
  Days of Treatment (Mean ± SD, _n_ = 10)  \n\n\n\n\nEffect of ATT on Cell Cycle Kinetics
  and Quantitative Percentage of Apoptotic Cells on MDA-MB-231 Cell\n\nBased on morphologic
  observation, it was suggested that ATT induced MDA-MB-231 cell death involved in
  a mechanism of apoptosis."
- The cell cycle distributions of MDA-MB-231 cells were investigated by flow cytometry
  after treatment with ATT.
- The results showed that subdiploid peak was increased in a time-dependent manner,
  which suggested that ATT induced a classical apoptosis.
- To further confirm and quantify apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells triggered by ATT,
  cells were stained with Annexin V-FITC/PI and subsequently analyzed by flow cytometry.
- The percentage of apoptotic cells expressed as Annexin V positive cells investigated.
- After treatment with ATT at different time intervals, apoptosis increased from 12.5%
  (_t_ = 0 h) to 32.0% (_t_ = 48 h) (Figure 3A, Figure 3B).
- All the results above suggested that ATT could promote MDA-MB-231 cell apoptosis.
- Therefore, the apoptotic mechanisms were further investigated.
- Figure 3.
- Effect of the ATT on cell cycle kinetics and quantitative percentage of apoptotic
  cells toward MDA-MB-231 cells.
- (A) After MDA-MB-231 cells triggered by 5 mg·L–1 ATT at the indicated times, the
  cells were stained with Annexin V-FITC/PI and subsequently analyzed by flow cytometry.
- (B) Percentage of apoptosis.
- Caspases are a family of 14 cysteine proteases that specifically cleave proteins
  at the C-terminal position of an aspartate residue, which can be activated by different
  apoptotic signaling to trigger apoptosis.
- To determine whether caspases contribute to the progress, the different caspase
  inhibitors were tested.
- The z-VAD-fmk, the z-DEVD-fmk, and the z-AEVD-fmk substantially promote the cell
  death, and the z-IETD-fmk effectively enhanced cell viability induced by ATT, but
  the z-LEHD-fmk had almost no effect on MDA-MB-231 cell viability (Figure 4A).
- In order to further confirm the characteristic cell death impacted by caspase inhibitors,
  MDA-MB-231 cells treated by caspase inhibitors were assessed by LDH activity-based
  assays second.
- As shown in Figure 4B, both apoptosis and necrosis were increased in z-VAD and z-DEVD-fmk
  treated cells compared with ATT treated cells, and the morphological changes give
  similar results.
- Figure 4.
- Effects of caspases on ATT induced MDA-MB-231 cell death.

- The cells were cultured in the absence or presence of z-VAD-fmk(20 μmol·L–1), Ac-YVAD-cmk(20
  μmol·L–1), z-DEVD-fmk(20 μmol·L–1), z-IETD-fmk(20 μmol·L–1), z-LEHD-fmk(20 μmol·L–1),
  and z-AEVD-fmk(10 μmol·L–1), 1 h prior to the addition of ATT, and then incubated
  for 24 h. _n_ = 5.

  z-DEVD-fmk(20 μmol·L–1), z-IETD-fmk(20 μmol·L–1), and z-LEHD-fmk(20 μmol·L–1), 1
  h prior to the addition of ATT, and then incubated for 24 h. _n_ = 3, mean ± SD.
- The loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential is a hallmark for apoptosis.
- It is an early event preceding phosphatidylserine externalization and coinciding
  with caspase activation.
- (27) Kinetic data indicate that mitochondria undergo major changes in membrane integrity
  before classical signs of apoptosis become manifest.
- These changes concern both the inner and the outer mitochondrial membranes, leading
  to a disruption of the inner transmembrane potential (ΔΨm) and the release of intermembrane
  proteins through the outer membrane.
- In this study, mitochondrial transmembrane potential (ΔΨm) was further assessed
  using rhodamine 123, a specific fluorescent probe for the analysis of mitochondrial
  transmembrane potential.
- The mitochondrial transmembrane potential decreased in a time-dependent manner,
  with the major decrease occurring at 36 h (Figure 5), suggesting that ATT induced
  MDA-MB-231 cell apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway.
- Figure 5.
- Effect of ATT on the loss mitochondrial membrane potential in MDA-MB-231 cells.
- The cells were incubated with 5 mg·L–1 ATT at indicated times and then were stained
  with rhodamine 123 and analyzed by FCM.
- Generally the PI3K/Akt pathway exerts its action in cell proliferation.
- Whether or not it is involved in ATT-treated MDA-MB-231 cells remains unknown, therefore
  the different inhibitors were tested.
- The PI3K family inhibitor (wortmannin), Akt inhibitor, PKC inhibitor (staurosporine),
  and PKCα inhibitor (H7) significantly promoted cell death (Figure 6A).
- As shown in Figure 6B, both NF-κB inhibitor (PDTC) and the proteasome inhibitor
  (MG-132) promoted cell death.
- Figure 6.
- The effect s of PI3K/Akt and NF-κB on ATT-treated MDA-MB-231 cells.
- (A) The cells were cultured in the absence or presence of Akt inhibitor, staurosporine,

- The total triterpenoids of apple (ATT) were extracted and concentrated from apple
  peels.
- UA and OA were the main bioactive constituents of ATT.
- The extracts of apple peels and flesh demonstrated significant bioactivities, such
  as antioxidant and antimammary tumors.
- (2) These provide solid evidence that consuming apple has many health benefits.
- In the in vitro antiproliferative assay, AP, ATT, UA, and OA exhibited potent inhibitory
  action against the tested cell lines, especially to human breast tumor cell lines.
- Among them, ATT exhibited the strongest antiproliferative activity.
- The ability of cancer cells to avert the apoptotic program has been identified as
  one of the major mechanisms for the development of cancers.
- The present studies demonstrated that ATT inhibited the proliferation of MDA-MB-231
  cells dramatically.
- Based on morphologic observation, it is suggested that ATT induced MDA-MB-231 cell
  death involved in a mechanism of apoptosis.
- DNA histograms used for cell cycle analysis consistently showed the presence of
  apoptotic populations among cells treated with ATT.
- To ascertain that the mode of cell death was by apoptosis, Annexin V-FITC/PI-flow
  cytometry analysis was carried out.
- Apoptosis is characterized by distinct biochemical features, in which activation
  of catabolic processes and enzymes occurs before cytolysis, thereby facilitating
  cell morphological changes, such as PS externalization to the cell surface, mitochondrial
  alterations, etc.
- Early apoptotic cells tend to exhibit PS on the outer cell membrane, which is normally
  positioned across the inner membrane,(28) and it has a strong binding affinity to
  Annexin V.(29) Accordingly, early apoptotic and some late apoptotic cells (commonly
  known as secondary necrotic cells) can be quantified by flow cytometry assay with
  fluoresceinated Annexin V (Annexin V-FITC) and DNA-binding fluorochrome (PI).
- (30) The percentage of apoptotic cells expressed as Annexin V positive cells increased
  in a time-dependent manner.
- Caspases are a family of cysteine proteases, which cleave protein substrates after
  their Asp residues.
- They appear to be involved in regulating the activation of apoptotic signal transmission,
  but it has become apparent that cells frequently die even when caspase function
  is blocked.
- (31) The result of this study showed that pretreatment with the caspase inhibitors
  z-VAD-fmk, z-DEVD-fmk, and z-AEVD-fmk significantly enhanced ATT-induced cell death,
  the z-IETD-fmk reduced the cell death, but the z-LEAD-fmk had almost no effect on
  MDA-MB-231 cell viability, therefore it implied that caspase-independent apoptosis
  happened.
- In order to further confirm the characteristic cell death affected by caspase inhibitors,
  MDA-MB-231 cells treated by caspase inhibitors were assessed by LDH activity-based
  assays.
- Both apoptosis and necrosis were increased in the Z-VAD and Z-DEVD treated group
  compared with the ATT treated group, and the morphological changes gave similar
  results.
- It has been reported that reactive oxygen species are involved in caspase-independent
  cell death,(32) but ROS generation was not detected in ATT treated MDA-MB-231 cell,
  coinciding with Kengo’s result.
- (33) All these results suggest that the caspase-independent cascade happened in
  ATT-mediated MDA-MB-231 cell apoptosis.
- Activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway is associated with tumorigenesis and resistance
  to apoptosis.
- Akt activation protects cells from a variety of apoptotic stimuli, including UV
  radiation and different classes of chemotherapeutic drugs and DNA damaging agents.
- Akt can also signal through to p53 by phosphorylating MDM2, resulting in its transport
  to the nucleus where it binds to p53 and promotes its degradation.
- Moreover, Akt inhibits apoptosis through the inhibition of Bcl-XL by the activation
  of NF-κB,(34) and NF-κB thus appears to be a target of the antiapoptotic Ras/PI3K/Akt
  pathway.
- '(35, 36)


  These results indicate that ATT-induced apoptosis of MDA-MB-231 cells may involve
  a mitochondrial-related pathway.'
- Furthermore, other pathways regulating apoptosis should be further investigated.
- This study demonstrated that the total apple triterpenoids (ATT) could effectively
  inhibit tumor growth in vitro and in vivo.
- Also, apple peels contains much higher triterpenoids (including UA and OA) than
  apple flesh.
- (10, 37) Therefore, consumption of whole apples may be an effective strategy for
  cancer protection.
