- 'Objective: This research quantified the phytochemical profile, antioxidant activities
  and cytotoxicity of Thai pigmented rice.'
- 'Method: Acidified ethanol extracts from seeds of twelve Thai pigmented rice cultivars
  (six black and six red rice) were investigated for their content of bioactive compounds
  (phenolics, anthocyanins, and procyanidins), antioxidant activities (FRAP, DPPH,
  and TBARS assays), and cytotoxicity on human promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60) cells.'
- 'Results: Black rice cultivars (0.05 – 0.54 mg GAE/mL extract) and red rice cultivars
  showed total phenolic content (0.21 – 0.99 mg GAE/mL extract).'
- The predominant phenolic pigments were anthocyanins (1.51±1.70 mg C3GE/L extract)
  for black rice and procyanidins (0.35±0.23 mg EPE/mL) for red rice.
- Antioxidant activity ranged within 0.06 – 1.36 mg AAE/mL for FRAP, IC50 0.10 – 1.12
  mg/mL for DPPH and 7.57 – 40.48 % for TBARS.
- Red rice tended to exhibit higher antioxidant activities than black rice in the
  FRAP assay, but there were no significant differences between rice colors in the
  DPPH and TBARS assays.
- Pigmented rice extracts containing the highest total phenolic content were selected
  to assess their cytotoxicity on human promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60) cells.
- Black rice showed higher cytotoxicity, corresponding with the lower IC50 compared
  to red rice.
- 'Conclusion: The results revealed that Thai pigmented rice is a natural antioxidant
  source with potential for use as an active ingredient in cosmetics, functional food
  and pharmaceuticals.'
