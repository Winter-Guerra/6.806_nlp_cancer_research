- The role of fruit and vegetables in breast cancer (BC) development has long been
  debated.
- A large variety of vegetables and fruit are consumed by Mediterranean populations,
  a favourable setting for evaluating the effects of these foods.
- The association between vegetables and fruit consumption, overall and by specific
  types, and BC risk was studied in the Italian section of the European Prospective
  Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition study.
- Over 31,000 women, aged 36-64 years, recruited in five Italian centers between 1993
  and 1998, were available for analyses with dietary and lifestyle information and
  anthropometric measurements.
- After a median follow-up of 11.25 years, 1,072 invasive and in situ incident BC
  cases were identified.
- Cox proportional hazard models (adjusted for education, anthropometry, reproductive
  history, hormone replacement therapy, physical activity, alcohol consumption and
  smoking habits) showed an inverse association between consumption of all vegetables
  and BC risk (highest vs. lowest quintile HR 0.65; 95% CI 0.53-0.81, P for trend
  = 0.003).
- According to subtypes of vegetables, an inverse association emerged for increasing
  consumption of leafy vegetables (highest vs. lowest quintile HR 0.70; 95% CI 0.57-0.86,
  P for trend = 0.0001) and fruiting vegetables (highest vs. lowest quintile HR 0.75;
  95% CI 0.60-0.94, P for trend = 0.01).
- An inverse association also emerged with increasing consumption of raw tomatoes
  (P for trend = 0.03).
- In contrast, no association of fruit, overall or by subtypes, with BC risk was found.
- In this Mediterranean population, a clear protective role of increasing vegetables
  consumption, mainly leafy and fruiting vegetables, on BC risk emerged.
