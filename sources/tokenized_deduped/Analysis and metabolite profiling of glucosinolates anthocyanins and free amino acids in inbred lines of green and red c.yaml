- We profiled and quantified glucosinolates (GSLs), anthocyanins and free amino acids
  in thirty-seven inbred lines green and red cabbage.
- Analysis of these distinct cabbages revealed the presence of 8 GSLs, 13 anthocyanins
  and 12 free amino acids.
- GSL contents were varied among the different lines of cabbage.
- The maximum levels of glucoraphanin (14.91 Î¼mol/g DW) and glucobrassicin (12.37)
  were found in FX 1-28 and FX 1-32 lines, respectively.
- Total GSLs in red cabbage lines were 50% higher than those of green cabbage.
- Anthocyanin contents in red cabbage were ranged from 4.11 to 6.81 mg/g DW in FX
  2-3 and FX 1-34 lines, respectively.
- Among the 13 anthocyanins, both cyanidin 3-(feruloyl) (sinapoyl)diglucoside-5-glucoside
  and cyanidin 3-(sinapoyl) (sinapoyl)diglucoside-5-glucoside levels were the highest
  amounts.
- The amounts of total free amino acids were ranged from 523.5 to 1308 mg/100 g fresh
  weight (FW) in green cabbage and 484.8 to 1271 in red cabbage, respectively.
- In red cabbage lines, 9.4% of the total free amino acids accounted essential amino
  acids such as valine, threonine, isoleucine, leucine and lysine.
- Thus, the amounts of GSLs, anthocyanins, and amino acids varied widely, and the
  variations in these compounds between the lines of cabbage were significant.
