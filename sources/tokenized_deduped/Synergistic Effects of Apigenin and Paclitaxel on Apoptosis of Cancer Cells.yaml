- It was well known that the clinical use of chemotherapeutic drugs is restricted
  by severe adverse reactions and drug resistances.
- Thus it is necessary to figure out a strategy to increase the specific anti-tumor
  efficiency of chemotherapeutic drugs.
- Apigenin, a kind of flavonoids, has been reported to possess anticancer activities
  with very low cytotoxicity to normal tissue.
- Our results from cell viability assay, western-blots and TdT-mediated dUTP-biotin
  nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay demonstrated the synergistic pro-apoptotic effects
  of a low dose of apigenin and paclitaxel in human cancer cell lines.
- To analyze the underlying mechanism, we examined reactive oxygen species (ROS) staining
  after cells were treated with a combination of apigenin and paclitaxel, or each
  of them alone.
- Data from flow-cytometry showed that superoxides but not reduction of peroxides
  accumulated in HeLa cells treated with apigenin or a combination of apigenin and
  paclitaxel.
- Apigenin and paclitaxel-induced HeLa cell apoptosis was related to the level of
  ROS in cells.
- We further evaluated activity and protein level of superoxide dismutase (SOD).
- Apigenin significantly inhibited SOD activity but did not alter the SOD protein
  level suggesting that apigenin promoted ROS accumulation through suppressing enzyme
  activity of SOD.
- Addition of Zn2+, Cu2+ and Mn2+ to cell lysates inhibited apigenin's effects on
  SOD activity.
- At the same time, data from caspase-2 over-expression and knocked-down experiments
  demonstrated that caspase-2 participated in apigenin and paclitaxel-induced HeLa
  cell apoptosis.
- Taken together, our study demonstrated that apigenin can sensitize cancer cells
  to paclitaxel induced apoptosis through suppressing SOD activity, which then led
  to accumulation of ROS and cleavage of caspase-2, suggesting that the combined use
  of apigenin and paclitaxel was an effective way to decrease the dose of paclitaxel
  taken.

- Chemotherapy is one of the most widely employed treatments for cancer.
- However many chemotherapeutic drugs can produce unpleasant side effects,especially
  when taken in high doses.
- One of the chemotherapeutic drugs, paclitaxel, a mitotic inhibitor, may lead to
  hypersensitivity reactions [1], neutropenia [2], neurotoxicity [3], cardiac rhythm
  disorder [4] and other miscellaneous toxic effects [5], which seriously worsens
  the quality of life of cancer patients and results in dosage reduction and discontinuation
  of treatment.
- It is therefore important to decrease the adverse side effects of chemotherapeutic
  agents in clinical treatment of cancer.
- In addition, drug resistance in clinical therapy often interferes with the efficiency
  of chemotherapeutic agents.
- Reactive oxygen species (ROS) including superoxide radical, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2),
  hydroxyl radical, nitric oxide, and various nitric oxide-derived reactive nitro
  species (RNS) are formed as natural byproducts of normal metabolism of oxygen in
  human cells and tissues.
- Because of their highly reactive character, they tend to become involved in unwanted
  reactions that cause damage to cells and ultimately lead to diseases.
- Cancer cells exhibit increased glycolysis in combination with a reduced rate of
  respiration and these alterations in metabolism have been shown to be associated
  with enhanced oxidative stress [6]–[8].
- A high cell redox status could stimulate tumor formation through creating an enhanced
  cell-proliferative environment, inducing DNA damage, and turning off tumor suppression
  functions [9], [10].
- Tumor growth and migration could be inhibited _in vitro_ by alteration of the environment
  around tumor cells to a more reducing one.
- In opposition to this, a high cell redox state would also support increased apoptosis,
  which would inhibit tumor formation.
- Thus, in cancer cells, the high redox state could enhance their tolerance to environmental
  stresses and chemotherapeutic drugs.
- Tumor cells expressed a higher level of MnSOD indicate a poor prognosis [11], [12].
- It has been shown that ROS have potential ability to process caspase-2 [13], [14]
  which is an initiator caspase led to mitochondrial membrane permeabilization [15]
  and is also an important member in apoptosis signal amplification loop [16].
- Besides, previous studies in caspase-2 knocked-out mice have shown that caspase-2
  activation was related with ROS accumulation [17].
- Reduced apoptosis rate was also detected in _caspase-2−/−_ oocytes [18].
- Apigenin (4′, 5, 7-trihydroxyflavone) is widely contained in many fruits and vegetables.
- Recently, it was reported that apigenin had a potential anti-tumor effects on several
  human cancer cell lines with low cytotoxicity and no mutagenic activity.
- '[19]–[21].'
- Apigenin could enhance the intracellular accumulation of ROS and had the pro-oxidant
  potential [22], [23] and decrease SOD activity in lung cancer cells [24].
- In the present work, we demonstrated that apigenin could sensitize cancer cells
  to paclitaxel induced apoptosis through suppressing SOD activity and leading to
  accumulation of ROS and cleavage of caspase-2, suggesting the combined use of apigenin
  and paclitaxel was effective for cancer therapy.

- The drug combination was determined by Chou-Talalay method.
- The CI was calculated by the Chou-Talalay equation, which takes into account both
  the potency (IC50 or Dm) and the sharp of the dose-effect curve (m value) [28],
  [29].
- 'The classic isobolgram (CI = 1) is given by:(A)


  In the denominators, (Dx)1 and (Dx)2 are the concentrations for D1 (apigenin) and
  D2 (paclitaxel) used alone that give x% inhibition, whereas in the numerators, (D)1
  and (D)2 are the doses of apigenin and paclitaxel used in combination that isoeffectively
  inhibit x%.'
- CI&lt;1, CI = 1, and CI&gt;1 suggest synergism, additive and antagonism, respectively.
- From the median-effect equation of Chou and Chou et al.
- '[29], [30], the (Dx)1 and (Dx)2 can be readily calculated.'
- '(B)


  Here Dm is the median-effect dose which obtained from the anti-log of the X-intercept
  of the median-effect plot, X-log (D) versus Y = log [fa/(1−fa)] or Dm = 10−(Y−intercept)/m,
  and m is the slope of the median-effect plot.'
- Automated calculation of m, Dm, Dx, and CI values are also allowed with computer
  software.
- Data was represented as mean±SD.
- Student's t-test was applied to analyze the statistical significance of variance
  pair-wise comparison.
- In all analyses, P&lt;0.05 was considered as statistically significant.
- Since toxicity of paclitaxel is coupled to its antitumor activity and apigenin has
  been reported to have antitumor activity with low toxicity, we first observed the
  co-effects of comcination paclitaxel with apigenin.
- HeLa cells were treated with various doses of apigenin, paclitaxel or both of them
  and then the cell viabilities were detected.
- As shown in Fig.
- 1A and B, both apigenin and paclitaxel dose dependently induced cytotoxicity with
  approximately 29% reduction of cell viability induced by apigenin at the dose of
  25 µM (Fig.
- 1A) and 24% reduction induced by paclitaxel at the dose of 10 nM (Fig.
- 1B) respectively.
- When we treated HeLa cells with 15 µM apigenin and 4 nM paclitaxel, over 50% decrease
  of cell viability was detected, nevertheless, less than 20% decrease of cell viability
  was observed in cells treated with apigenin or paclitaxel respectively (Fig.
- 1C).
- We carried out Chou-Talalay calculation to confirm the synergistic effects of apigenin
  and paclitaxel on HeLa cells.
- The combination index (CI) was 0.3918±0.0436 at the dose of 15 µM apigenin and 4
  nM paclitaxel indicating synergistic effects of apigenin and paclitaxel.
- These results indicated a significantly increased cytotoxicity when apigenin and
  paclitaxel were administrated to HeLa cells simultaneously.
- Also shown in Fig.
- 1C, combination of apigenin with paclitaxel induced the similar results in the cancer
  cells other than Hela cells including Hep3B and A549 cells.
- However, 15 µM apigenin, 4 nM paclitaxel or combination of them did not result in
  cytotoxicity to HEK293A cells respectively (Fig.
- 1C).
- 'These data suggested there were synergistic effects of apigenin and paclitaxel
  for specifically killing cancer cells






  Figure 1.'
- Apigenin and paclitaxel enhance cytotoxicity to cancer cells compared with paclitaxel.
- A, HeLa cells were treated with increased concentrations of apigenin (0–100 µM)
  for 24 hours.
- Cell vitality was measured.
- The experiment was independently repeated for three times and data were shown as
  mean ± SD.
- B, HeLa cells were treated with increased concentrations of paclitaxel (0–50 nM)
  for 24 hours.
- Cell vitality was detected and analyzed as described in A.
- C, HeLa, A549, Hep3B and HEK293A cells were subjected to treatment with apigenin
  (15 µM) combination with paclitaxel (4 nM) for 24 hours.
- Cell vitality was detected as described in A.
- D, HeLa cells were treated with apigenin or paclitaxel respectively, besides, in
  other groups, apigenin was added to HeLa cells 2 hours before or after paclitaxel
  treatment, or apigenin and paclitaxel were added to HeLa cells at the same time.
- TUNEL staining was performed and detected with a Guava® TUNEL Kit.
- Numbers depicted the percentage of TUNEL-positive cells.
- E, Cells were either left untreated or treated as previously described in D. At
  the indicated time, cells were stained with annexin V/PI dye.
- Analyses were conducted on 5,000 cells in each trail.
- F, HeLa cells were treated with increased concentrations of apigenin or paclitaxel
  respectively, or both of them for 24 hours.
- Then the cell lysates were subjected to Western blot to determine protein level
  of caspase-3 and PARP.
- V represents vehicle (dimethyl sulfoxide).
- p&lt;0.05 compared with untreated group; p&lt;0.01 compared with untreated group.
- It has been reported that both paclitaxel [31], [32] and apigenin [21] can induce
  cell apoptosis.
- We next verify whether combination use of apigenin and paclitaxel could induce more
  acute apoptosis in HeLa cells.
- Compared to those groups treated with apigenin or paclitaxel individually, apigenin
  and paclitaxel co-treated groups showed more TUNEL positive staining cells.
- The rates of TUNEL positive staining cells were notably increased from 17.95% in
  paclitacel treated group and 19.65% of apigenin treated group to around 40% in the
  groups treated by combination of them (Fig.
- 1D).
- To quantify apoptosis, FACS analysis was carried out after staining cells with FITC-annexin-V
  plus propidium iodide (PI).
- Data shown in Fig.
- 1E indicated that the number of surviving cells decreased gradually after co-treatment
  with apigenin and paclitaxel and only less than 60% were survived 24 hours after
  apigenin and paclitaxel treatment.
- Since activation of caspases is an important reason for apoptosis, we further detected
  the cleavages of caspase-3 and PARP using western blot analysis.
- As shown in Fig.
- 1F, both the cleavages of caspase-3 and PARP were significantly enhanced by apigenin/paclitaxel
  co-treatment compared with apigenin or paclitaxel treatment alone.
- These results confirmed that apigenin/paclitaxel co-treatment induced a significant
  apoptotic death of HeLa cells suggesting that combination use of apigenin and paclitaxel
  would produce a better anti-tumor effect than use of apigenin or paclitaxel alone.
- Meanwhile flavonoids including apigenin were widely recognized as the antioxidants,
  their pro-oxidant properties have also been reported [33].
- We speculated the anticancer effects of combination apigenin/paclitaxel might be
  related with production of ROS in HeLa cells induced by apigenin.
- Therefore we observed the levels in HeLa cells treated with with apigenin, paclitaxel
  or both of them.
- Two ROS-specific dyes, DHE and CM-H2DCFDA displayed superoxide species and H2O2
  in target cells respectively [24].
- CM-H2DCFDA is mainly oxidized by hydrogen peroxides (H2O2) and hydroxyl radical,
  DHE is oxidized by superoxide anions (O2−).
- HeLa cells were stained with DHE and CM-H2DCFDA followed by flow cytometry.
- As shown in Fig.
- 2, DHE-specific ROS increased (Fig.
- 2A) whereas CM-H2DCFDA-specific ROS reduced (Fig.
- 2B) in HeLa cells treated with apigenin within the 30 minutes.
- No change was detected in the cells treated with paclitaxel alone.
- A similar trend and a more significant change in ROS' status were observed in those
  cells treated with combination of apigenin and paclitaxel compared with cells treated
  with apigenin alone (Fig.
- 2).
- DHE staining observed in these experiments resulted from the oxidation by superoxide
  species suggesting that apigenin increased superoxide specie related ROS in HeLa
  cells.
- A, HeLa cells were treated with apigenin (15 µM) alone or together with paclitaxel
  (4 nM), for indicated periods.
- DHE (5 µM) was added into cell cultures 30 minutes before the treatment.
- DHE staining in cells were detected and analyzed by Guava EasyCyte™ System.
- DHE staining in untreated cells were used as the negative control.
- B, CM-H2DCFDA (5 µM) staining was performed and analyzed as described in A.
- Next we evaluated whether apigenin/paclitaxel-induced apoptosis was dependent on
  ROS accumulation.
- N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), a well approved ROS scavenger, has been used to antagonize
  the effect of ROS.
- Pretreatment of HeLa cells with 100 µM NAC effectively suppressed the generation
  of superoxide species (Fig.
- 3A) and significantly inhibited the cell apoptosis induced by apigenin and paclitaxel
  co-treatment (Fig.
- 3B).
- The above data suggested that ROS were essential for apigenin/paclitaxel-induced
  HeLa cell apoptosis.
- Figure 3.
- ROS accumulation is required for apigenin/paclitaxel-triggered apoptosis A, HeLa
  cells were treated with ROS scavenger NAC (100 µM) for 2 hours or not, then stained
  with DHE (5 µM), followed by the treatment with apigenin (15 µM) and paclitaxel
  (4 nM) for 60 minutes.
- Cells were then collected and detected by Guava EasyCyte™ System as described in
  Fig.
- 2A.
- B, HeLa cells were treated with NAC (100 µM) for 2 hours and then incubated with
  apigenin (15 µM) and paclitaxel (4 nM) for 24 hours.
- Cell apoptosis was measured by TUNEL assay as described in Fig.
- 1
- We observed that after HeLa cells were treated with apigenin, the abundance of superoxide
  species increased whereas H2O2 decreased.
- Considering SOD was a cellular enzyme which can convert superoxide to H2O2, we speculated
  that apigenin might reduce the activity of SOD and consequently led to the accumulation
  of superoxide species.
- We then investigated the effect of apigenin on protein level as well as the enzyme
  activity of SOD.
- A significant suppression of both CuZnSOD (SOD1) and MnSOD (SOD2) activity was observed
  in HeLa cells within 30 minutes after apigenin or apigenin/paclitaxel but not paclitaxel
  treatment (Fig.
- 4A).
- However, there was no apparent change observed in the protein level of CuZnSOD and
  MnSOD after apigenin administration (Fig.
- 4B).
- Accordingly, it was evidential that apigenin suppressed SOD activity and thus induced
  the accumulation of ROS.
- Figure 4.
- Suppression of SOD activity by apigenin is associated with metal ions in HeLa cells.
- A, HeLa cells were treated with apigenin (15 µM), paclitaxel (4 nM), or both of
  them for 30 minutes.
- SOD activity was measured with Cayman SOD detection kit.
- The experiment was independently repeated for three times and data were shown with
  mean±S.D.
- p&lt;0.05 compared with control group; p&lt;0.01 compared with control group.
- B, HeLa cells were treated with apigenin (15 µM) and paclitaxel (4 nM) for 30 minutes.
- Cell lysates were subjected to Western-blot Protein to determine levels of SOD1
  and SOD2.
- C, HeLa cells were treated with apigenin (15 µM) for 30 minutes and lysed by sonication.
- Cell lysates were then incubated with CuCl2 (8 µM), ZnCl2 (8 µM) and MnCl2 (8 µM)
  for 30 minutes on ice.
- The SOD activity were measured and analyzed as described in A.
- D, HeLa cells were lysed by sonication and cell lysates were then incubated with
  above mentioned metal ions for 30 minutes on ice.
- SOD activity was measured as mentioned above.
- p&lt;0.05 compared with apigenin-treated group; p&lt;0.01 compared with apigenin-treated
  group.
- As above results showed that apigenin suppressed SOD activity, and it had been reported
  that apigenin could form stable complexation with metal ions _in vitro_ [34], we
  thus determined if apigenin could form complexation with metal ions and suppress
  SOD activity through preventing SOD from assemble with its cofactors.
- HeLa cells were treated with 15 µM apigenin for 30 minutes and the lysates of cells
  were incubated with 8 µM of ZnCl2 (aq), CuCl2 (aq) or MnCl2 (aq) respectively on
  ice for another 30 minutes.
- The activity of SOD was measured using the Cayman Superoxide Dismutase Assay Kit
  as described in Material and Methods.
- As expected, apigenin significantly suppressed the activities of both CuZnSOD and
  MnSOD, but the activity CuZnSOD increased after Cu2+, Zn2+, and Mn2+ exposure and
  the activity of MnSOD also increased obviously after Mn2+ exposure (Fig.
- 4C).
- Additionally, no significant change of SOD activity was found when cell lysates
  were directly exposed to Cu2+, Zn2+ or Mn2+ without apigenin treatment (Fig.
- 4D), indicating that these metal ions did not enhance basal SOD activity.These results
  suggested that apigenin suppressed SOD activity probably through forming a stable
  complexation with those metals in cells [34], and apigenin might have higher binding
  affinity to Mn2+.
- Apigenin inhibited the activity of SOD and combination of apigenin/paclitaxel was
  more effective in inducing apoptosis of cancer cells than each of them alone.
- In order to confirm that apigenin-induced decrease of activity of SOD was critical
  in the apoptosis triggered by apigenin/paclitaxel co-treatment, we observed paclitaxel-induced
  apoptosis after blocking SOD enzyme activity.
- DETC (diethylthiocarbamate), a well approved inhibitor of both CuZnSOD and MnSOD
  was applied in our present study [35].
- As similar as apigenin, DETC suppressed the activity of SOD and enhanced paclitaxel
  induced apoptosis as well (Fig.
- 5A).
- These data strongly suggested that reduction of SOD activity by apigenin is critical
  in the enhancement of paclitaxel-induced apoptosis.
- Figure 5.
- Apigenin-induced ROS are required for cleavage of caspase-2, MMP and cell apoptosis.
- A, HeLa cells were incubated with apigenin (15 µM)/paclitaxel (4 nM), or paclitaxel
  (4 nM) together with or without 1 mM DETC (an inhibitor of SOD) for 24 hours and
  then cells were subjected to TUNEL assay as described previously.
- B, HeLa cells were pretreated with NAC (100 µM) for 2 hours, followed by the treatment
  with apigenin (15 µM) and paclitaxel (4 nM) for 24 hours.
- Cleavage of caspase-2 was detected by Western-blot analysis with the control of
  β-actin.
- C, HeLa cells were pretreated with z-VDVAD-fmk (25 µM), a specific inhibitor of
  caspase-2, and then were treated with apigenin (15 µM) and paclitaxel (4 nM) for
  24 hours.
- Protein levels of cleaved PARP and procaspase-3 were detected by Western-blot analysis.
- D, HeLa cells were pretreated with z-VDVAD-fmk (25 µM) for 30 minutes and then were
  treated with apigenin (15 µM) and paclitaxel (4 nM) for 8 hours.
- Cells were then harvested and mitochondrial membrane potential was detected using
  a Guava EasyCyte™ MitoPotential Kit and analyzed by Guava EasyCyte™ System.
- MMP was showed as the count of depolarized cells.
- The experiment was independently repeated for three times and data were shown as
  mean±SD.
- p&lt;0.01 compared with untreated group.
- E, HeLa cells were incubated with apigenin (15 µM) and paclitaxel (4 nM) for 24
  hours, and then cells were subjected to RT-PCR analysis.
- GAPDH mRNA was used as house keeper gene.
- Mitochondrial pathway plays an important role in ROS triggered apoptosis [36], [37]
  and caspase-2 has been considered as the apical caspase in mitochondrial death signal
  amplification loop [38], [39].
- ROS-induced caspase-2 cleavage and feedback amplification of the apoptotic signal
  have also been investigated [40].
- To examine the effect of apigenin on mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis, caspase-2
  precursor cleavage was detected in apigenin-treated HeLa cells by western-blot analysis.
- Co-treatment of HeLa cells with apigenin and paclitaxel showed very low level of
  caspase-2 precursor.
- When HeLa cells were pretreated with NAC, the caspase-2 precursor level recovered
  (Fig.
- 5B).
- The caspase-2 inhibitor z-VDVAD-fmk significantly reduced the cleavage of caspase-3
  and PARP in HeLa cells treated with apigenin combined with paclitaxel (Fig.
- 5C).
- MMP may be a causal event in precipitating apoptosis.
- The data in Fig.
- 5D indicated that apigenin but not paclitaxel induced an increase of depolarization
  of MMP suggesting the importance of apigenin in apigenin/paclitaxel induced cancer
  cell apoptosis.
- As expected, z-VDVAD-fmk inhibited the increase of MMP in apigenin and apigenin/paclitaxel
  treated groups (Fig.
- 5D).
- Fig.
- 5E showed that treatment of apigenin, paclitaxel or apigenin/paclitaxel did not
  alter the mRNA level of caspase-2 indicating apigenin/paclitaxel co-treatment only
  increased activation of caspase-2.
- To confirm the importance of caspase-2 in apigenin/paclitaxel-triggered mitochondrial
  membrane permeabilization and apoptosis, we perform caspase-2 over-expression and
  knock-down experiments and measured AIF, Endo G and cytochrome c releasing from
  mitochondrion in HeLa cells.
- Over-expression of caspase-2 significantly enhanced apigenin or apigenin/paclitaxel-induced
  increase of AIF, Endo G and cytochrome c in cytoplasma fraction and decrease of
  AIF, Endo G and cytochrome c in mitochondrial fraction (Fig.
- 6A).
- As expected, caspase-2 knock-down resulted in the opposite on apigenin or apigenin/paclitaxel
  induced changes of AIF, Endo G and cytochrome c in HeLa cells (Fig.
- 6A).
- Furthermore, as shown in Fig.
- 6B, over-expression of caspase-2 apparently increased apigenin/paclitaxel-induced
  cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP and knock-down of caspase-2 inhibited such effect
  of apigenin/paclitaxel.
- We next detected cell vitality to evaluate mediated effect of caspase-2 on apigenin/paclitaxel
  triggered HeLa cell apoptosis.
- Over-expression of caspase-2 caused about 10% decrease of cell vitality both in
  apigenin and co-treatment groups, and caspase-2 silence significantly increased
  cell vitality.
- However, there was no significant change in paclitaxel treated groups no matter
  whether caspase-2 was over-expressed or down-expressed.
- Combined, the above data suggested that caspase-2 did play an important role in
  apigenin/paclitaxel induced apoptosis of HeLa cells.
- Figure 6.
- Caspase-2 cleavage is important for apigenin/paclitaxel-induced apoptosis.
- A, HeLa cells were transfected with flag-caspase2 or RNAi-caspase2.
- Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were treated with apigenin (15 µM),
  paclitaxel (4 nM) or both of them for 24 hours.
- The mitochondrial fraction was separated from cytosolic fraction.
- The protein levels of AIF, Endo G and cytochrome c in both fractions were measured.
- β-actin and COX-IV were probed as the cytosolic and mitochondrial control respectively.
- Cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions were displayed as C and M respectively.
- B, Cells were treated as same as described in A.
- Protein levels of PARP, cleaved PARP, procaspase-2 and procaspase-3 were determined
  by Western blot analysis.
- C, Flag-caspase2 or RNAi-caspase2 was transfected to HeLa cells, and 48 hours after
  tranfection, cells were treated with apigenin (15 µM), paclitaxel (4 nM) or both
  of them for 24 hours.
- Cell vitality was measured with a cytotoxicity detection kit from Promega.
- The experiment was independently repeated for three times and data were shown as
  mean±S.D.
- p&lt;0.05 compared with empty-plasmid transfected group.
- It has been well recognized that apigenin and many other flavonoids act as anti-oxidants.
- Their ability to scavenge ROS was believed to be related with their effects on anti-cancer,
  chemoprevention [41] and anti-inflammation [42].
- However, up until now, only a few attentions have been paid to the pro-oxidant effect
  of apigenin [22].
- The reason for why flavonoids possess both pro-oxidant and anti-oxidant capability
  is unclear.
- Some studies suggested that it depended on the dose of flavonoids and the type of
  cells [24].
- Cancer cells are frequently under persistent oxidative stress because of oncogenic
  stimulation, increased metabolic activity, and mitochondrial malfunction [43], [44].
- In the present study, we demonstrated that apigenin potentiated ROS accumulation
  in HeLa cells, which correlated closely with its inhibitory effect on SOD activity.
- SODs are the only enzymes dismuting superoxide radicals.
- We noticed that Zn2+, Cu2+ and Mn2+ could reverse apigenin-induced suppression of
  SOD activity whereas these metal ions did not affect the basal SOD activity.
- It was probably that apigenin formed a stable complex with metal ions and acted
  as a competitive inhibitor of SOD.
- More detailed studies are needed in the future.
- In fact, two stable coordination geometries of the aluminum complex of apigenin
  have been identified [34].
- Our study indicated that apigenin/paclitaxel-induced the cleavage of caspase-2 in
  a ROS dependent manner and consequently led to MMP which resulted in leakage of
  pro-apoptotic proteins from mitochondrion, such as SMAC/DIABLO [45], [46], Htr2A/Omi
  [47] and cytochrome c [46].
- These data was consistent with previous studies in neuron stem cells [48], leukemia
  cells [49], and MCF-7 cells (Fig.
- S1), which suggested ROS as a precipitating factor in caspase-2 cleavage in these
  cell lines.
- Numerous _in vivo_ studies have showed that SOD could highly express in aggressive
  human solid tumors [50].
- It has also been reported that MnSOD can be induced by cytotoxic drugs and this
  may be related with development of drug resistance and a poor prognosis after chemotherapy
  in cancer cells [51], [52].
- In our current study, apigenin treatment caused the suppression of SOD, particularly
  the suppression of MnSOD.
- On the other hand, DETC, a well approved inhibitor of both CuZnSOD and MnSOD enhanced
  paclitaxel induced apoptosis.
- These results strongly suggested that SOD activity was a critical factor in paclitaxel
  induced apoptosis and apigenin enhanced paclitaxel-induced apoptosis through suppressing
  SOD activity.
- Though it have been addressed that apigenin was a potential inducer of intracellular
  oxidative stress, and apigenin-induced production of ROS play a vital role in apoptosis
  signal [22], very limited data was presented on setting apigenin as a candidate
  to be used in combination with traditional anti-neoplastic agents.
- Paclitaxel, a potent traditional anti-cancer drug, can cause both mitotic arrest
  and apoptotic cell death [53].
- However, a high dose of paclitaxel applied clinically shows serious side effects
  and drug resistance [1]–[5].
- Our results demonstrated the synergistic effects of apigenin and paclitaxel on promoting
  HeLa cell apoptosis.
- Apigenin sensitized HeLa cells to paclitaxel-induced apoptosis through suppressing
  MnSOD and cooperated with paclitaxel to stimulate caspase-2 activation.
- The results that AIF, EndoG and cytochrome c were releasing from mitochondrion indicates
  both caspase dependent and caspase independent machineries are working in the apigenin
  enhanced paclitaxel induced apoptosis.
- Apigenin, as a potent natural anti-cancer compound, showed little cytotoxicity toward
  non-transformed cells and possessed non-mutagenic nature.
- The combination use of apigenin and paclitaxel will greatly improve the efficiency
  of paclitaxel as a chemotherapeutic drug.
- Reduction of the dose of paclitaxel in cancer therapy will decrease its adverse
  reactions.
- In conclusion, our study demonstrates that combination of apigenin and paclitaxel
  possesses a more apparent anti-cancer activity _in vitro_ compared with each of
  them alone.
- Mechanically, apigenin suppresses the activity of SOD to lead cancer cells sensitive
  to cytotoxity of paclitaxel.
- Furthermore, ROS-induced activation of caspase-2 and depolarization of MMP participate
  in apigenin and paclitaxel induced cancer cell apoptosis.
- Therefore, this study indicates the synergistic anti-cancer effects of apigenin
  and paclitaxel in tumor chemotherapy.
