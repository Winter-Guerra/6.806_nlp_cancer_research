- Breast cancer is the most common cancer and the leading cause of cancer death in
  women.
- Although tamoxifen therapy is successful for some patients, it does not provide
  adequate benefit for those who have estrogen receptor (ER)-negative cancers.
- Therefore, we approached novel treatment strategies by combining two potential bioactive
  dietary supplements for the reactivation of ERα expression for effective treatment
  of ERα-negative breast cancer with tamoxifen.
- Bioactive dietary supplements such as green tea polyphenols (GTPs) and sulforaphane
  (SFN) inhibit DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs), respectively,
  which are of central importance to cancer prevention.
- In the present study, we have observed that treatment of ERα-negative breast cancer
  cells with GTPs and SFN alone or in combination leads to the reactivation of ERα
  expression.
- The combination of 20 µg/mL GTPs and 5 µM SFN was found to be the optimal dose of
  ERα-reactivation at 3 days in MDA-MB-231 cells.
- The reactivation of ERα expression was consistently correlated with _ERα_ promoter
  hypomethylation and hyperacetylation.
- Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis of the _ER_α promoter revealed that
  GTPs and SFN altered the binding of ERα-transcriptional co-repressor complex thereby
  contributing to _ERα_-reactivation.
- In addition, treatment with tamoxifen in combination with GTPs and SFN significantly
  increased both cell death and inhibition of cellular proliferation in MDA-MB-231
  cells in comparison to treatment with tamoxifen alone.
- Collectively, our findings suggest that a novel combination of bioactive-HDAC inhibitors
  with bioactive-demethylating agents is a promising strategy for the effective treatment
  of hormonal refractory breast cancer with available anti-estrogens.

- Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer
  death among women, accounting for 23% of the total cancer cases and 14% of the cancer
  deaths [1].
- One of the important classifications of breast tumors is based on the presence or
  absence of the estrogen receptor (ER).
- While the majority of breast cancers are ER-positive, approximately 25–30% are ER-negative
  [2], [3].
- Patients with ER-positive breast cancer receive hormonal therapy using either selective
  estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) such as tamoxifen, raloxifene and lasofoxifene,
  or with aromatase inhibitors (AIs) such as anastrozole, letrozole, and exemestene,
  and have a better prognosis.
- However, treatment of patients with ER-negative tumor is challenging due to the
  poor response to hormonal therapies in the absence ER expression.
- Therefore alternative targeted therapies are aimed to prevent and treat hormonal
  refractory breast cancers.
- Recently, many studies have addressed the possibilities of reactivation of ER expression
  in ER-negative breast cancer cells for the effective treatment with available SERMs.
- Further, the absence of _ERα_ gene expression in ER-negative breast cancer is largely
  due to epigenetic silencing instead of DNA mutation or deletion of the _ERα_ gene
  [4], [5].
- Previous studies have shown that epigenetic silencing of _ER_ is associated with
  DNA hypermethylation at the _ER_-promoter in ER-negative breast cancer cells [6],
  [7].
- In addition, histone modifications, specifically histone acetylation/deactylations
  have also been implicated as common mechanisms underlying ER silencing in human
  malignant mammary cells [7], [8].
- Hence, treatment of ER-negative breast cancer cells with DNA methyltransferase (DNMT)
  inhibitors such as 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine and/or histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors
  such as trichostatin A (TSA) leads to the reactivation of ER expression, underscoring
  the importance of DNMTs and HDACs in maintaining the repressive environment at the
  _ER_α gene [2], [9], [10].
- However, the use of synthetic small molecules as the DNMT and HDAC inhibitors for
  the ER-reactivation in ER-negative breast tumor would be expected to result in too
  many adverse side-effects to warrant practical application to chemoprevention and
  therapy.
- Many studies have demonstrated the chemopreventive properties of green tea polyphenols
  (GTPs) and sulforaphane (SFN) against various types of carcinoma through multiple
  mechanisms such as anti-oxidant, induction of apoptosis, cell cycle regulation,
  inhibition of angiogenesis and metastasis [11], [12].
- Further, (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a major constituent of GTPs, is
  known to complex with the DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) which reduces methylating
  activity of many genes in cancer cells as well as in mouse models [13], [14].
- The hypomethylation induced by EGCG has been shown to be associated with reactivation
  of methylation-silenced tumor suppressor genes such as _p16INK4a_, _p21CIP/WAF_
  and the DNA mismatch repair gene, _human mutL homologue 1_ (_hMLH1_), which eventually
  leads to tumor suppression [13], [15].
- Further, SFN is a bioactive dietary supplement found in cruciferous vegetables,
  that has an established histone deactylation (HDAC) inhibition activity [16], [17].
- The HDAC inhibition activity of SFN has been shown to lead to an increase in the
  global and local histone acetylation status of a number of genes including tumor
  promoter genes such as human telomerase reverse transcriptase (_hTERT_) in breast
  cancer [18].
- Both DNA methylation and histone acetylations have been the focus of considerable
  attention in cancer prevention and therapy.
- In addition to histone acetylation and promoter methylation, histone modifications-mediated
  transcriptional regulation of _ERα_ expression has emerged.
- The _ERα_ promoter is mostly hypermethylated in ER-negative breast cancer cells
  [6], [7].
- Hypermethylation of CpG-islands may inhibit transcription by recruiting the methyl-CpG
  binding domain (MBD) proteins or by interfering with the recruitment and function
  of basal transcription factors or transcriptional coactivators [2], [7].
- Similarly, ER-negative breast cancer cells also display a relative depletion of
  acetyl-H3 and acetyl-H4 which provide transcriptional repressive environment at
  the _ERα_ gene [8] Therefore, in the present study, we tested our hypothesis that
  a combination of dietary DNMT and HDAC inhibitors may lead to transcriptional activation
  of _ERα_ expression in ER-negative breast cancer cells.
- Our study demonstrates that treatment of ER-negative breast cancer cells with GTPs
  and SFN synergistically reactivates ERα expression through epigenetic alteration
  of CpG methylation and histone acetylation-mediated release of transcriptional inhibitor
  complex at the _ER_α promoter.
- Furthermore, our findings suggest a novel dietary combination of DNA methyltransferase
  and histone deacetylase inhibitors contribute to ER re-expression in ER-negative
  breast cancer for the effective treatment of hormonal refractory breast cancers
  (HRBCs) with available SERMs.
- GTPs and R, S-sulforaphane were purchased from LKT laboratories (Minneapolis, MN).

  (DMEM) (Mediatech Inc, Manassas, VA) supplemented with 10% dextran-charcoal–stripped
  fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals, Lawrenceville, GA) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin
  (Mediatech, Herndon, VA) as described previously [4], [18].
- Control MCF10A cells were also procured from ATCC and maintained as described previously

  for 2 h. The microtiter plate containing the cells was centrifuged at 600 g for
  5 min at 4°C.
- The MTT solution was removed from the wells by aspiration and the MTT-formazan crystals
  were dissolved in DMSO (150 µL).
- Absorbance was recorded at 540 nm wavelength.
- To observe the effects of 17β-estradiol (E2) (Sigma) and tamoxifen (Sigma) on cellular

- The primers specific for _ERα_ (Hs01046818_ml) and _glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate
  dehydrogenase_ (_GAPDH_) (Hs99999905_ml) were obtained from Inventorial Gene Assay
  Products (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).

- Thermal cycling was initiated at 94°C for 4 min followed by 35 cycles of PCR (94°C,
  15 s; 60°C, 30 s).
- The calculations for determining the relative level of gene expression were made
  using the cycle threshold (_C_t) method.
- 'The mean _C_t values from duplicate measurements were used to calculate the expression
  of the target gene using the formula: fold change in gene expression, 2−ΔΔCt = 2−{ΔCt
  (treated samples)−ΔC_t_ (untreated control)}, where ΔC_t_ = C_t_ (ERα)−C_t_ (GAPDH).'
- Protein was extracted from cultured cells using the RIPA-lysis buffer (Upstate Biotechnology,
  Lake Placid, NY) following the manufacturer's protocol.
- For immunoblot analysis, 100 µg of protein was resolved on a 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred
  onto nitrocellulose membrane.

  0.1% Triton- X100 in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), and washed with PBS for 10
  min.
- The cells were then blocked with 5% goat serum in PBS for 30 min, followed by incubation
  with 3% H2O2 for 20 min to quench endogenous peroxidase.
- After washing the cells with PBS, cells were incubated with 5- mC specific antibody
  (1:500, v/v, Calbiochem, Gibbstown, NJ) for 1 h, followed by sequential incubation
  of cells with biotinylated secondary antibody, and HRP-conjugated streptavidin,
  and finally with diaminobenzidine (DAB) substrate for 5-mC positive staining.
- Nuclei were counterstained with methyl green (Sigma).
- Cells were treated with GTP and SFN for 3 days as described above.
- Genomic DNA was isolated using the DNA Isolation Kit (Qiagen, Maryland, MD) according
  to the manufacturer's instructions, and dot-blot analysis was performed as described
  previously [22].
- Briefly, 1 µg of genomic DNA was transferred onto Hybond-ECL nitrocellulose membranes
  (Amersham Biosciences, UK) using Bio-Dot Microfiltration Apparatus (Bio-Rad Laboratories,
  Inc. Hercules, CA), and fixed by baking the membrane for 30 min at 80°C.
- After blocking the non-specific-binding sites, the membrane was incubated with the
  antibody specific to 5-mC (1:500, v/v) followed by incubation with a HRP-conjugated
  secondary antibody.
- The bands were then visualized using the ECL-detection system following the protocol
  of the manufacturer (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).

  and equal DNA loading was verified by staining the membranes with 0.2% methylene
  blue.
- DNMTs activity was determined using a colorimetric DNMTs activity assay kit (Epigentek,
  Brooklyn, NY) according to the manufacturer's instruction.
- The reaction was initiated by adding 20 µg of nuclear extracts, containing active
  DNMTs, to the unique cytosine-rich DNA substrate-coated ELISA plate and incubated
  for 60 min at 37°C.
- The methylated DNA can be recognized with anti-5-methylcytosine antibody.
- The amount of methylated DNA, which is proportional to enzyme activity, is calorimetrically
  quantified at 450 nm.
- Cultured MDA-MB-231 cells were harvested at the indicated time points and nuclear
  extracts were prepared using the nuclear extraction reagent (Pierce, Rockford, IL).

  ice-cold PBS, re-suspended in SDS-lysis buffer (1% SDS, 50 mM Tris-HCL, pH 8.0,
  10 mM EDTA and protease inhibitor cocktail), and then sonicated to an average length
  of sheered genomic DNA of approximately 400–1000 bp.
- The antibodies used in the ChIP assays were ChIP-validated acetyl-histone H3, acetyl-histone
  H3K9, acetyl-histone H4, trimethyl-histone H3K9 (Upstate Biotechnology), HDAC1,
  MeCP2, MBD1, SUV39H1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and DNMT1 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA).
- A “no antibody” control was also used to evaluate-ChIP efficiency.
- ChIP-purified DNA was quantified by using quantitative-PCR (qPCR) using the Platinum
  SYBR Green detection system and q-PCR specific _ERα_ primer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
  CA) as described earlier [18], [21].
- The binding of various transcription factors to the _ERα_ promoter was analyzed
  by standard PCR conditions as described previously [4].
- Briefly, the _ERα_ promoter primers were forward-5′-GAA CCG TCC GCA GCT CAA GAT
  C-3′, reverse-5′-GTC TGA CCG TAG ACC TGC GCG TTG-3′, with a total of 30 cycles at
  94°C for 30 s, 56°C for 30 s, 72°C for 1 min and final extension was extended at
  72°C for 5 min.
- After amplification, PCR products were separated on 1.5% agarose gels and visualized
  by ethidium bromide staining using Kodak 1D 3.6.1 image software and quantified.
- Quantitative data were analyzed by optical densitometry using ImageJ Software version
  1.36b (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/).
- The DNA methylation status of the _ERα_ promoter was assayed by sodium bisulfite
  methylation sequencing using the EpiTect-Bisulfite modification kit following the
  manufacture's protocol (Qiagen, Valencia, CA).
- Approximately 2 µg of genomic DNA was used for bisulfite modification and then amplified

- Approximately 2.2×105 cells per well were placed in a 6-well plate and allowed to
  incubate overnight.
- The ERα siRNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was made into 10 µM stock using nuclease
  free water and 9 nM siRNA was delivered to the cells using the Silencer siRNA Transfection
  kit (Ambion/Applied Biosystems, TX, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
- siCONTROL Non-Targeting siRNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used as a negative
  control.
- Treatments incorporating GTPs and SFN with or without TAM were performed for an
  additional 72 h. Cells were harvested and checked for ERα knockdown after 3 days
  using western blot analysis.
- Breast cancer cells transfected with ERα and control siRNA transfected cells were
  treated with the indicated concentrations of GTPs and SFN with or without TAM for
  72 h. The cells were then lysed with nuclei lysis buffer provided for apoptosis
  assays using the Cell Death Detection ELISA Kit (Roche, Palo Alto, CA) as described
  previously [23].
- Briefly, the cytoplasmic histone/DNA fragments were extracted and incubated in microtiter
  plate modules coated with anti-histone antibody.
- Subsequently, the peroxidase-conjugated anti-DNA antibody was used for the detection
  of immobilized histone/DNA fragments, followed by color development with 2,2′-azinobis(3-ethylbenzo-thiazoline-6-​sulfonicacid)
  substrate for peroxidase.
- The spectrophotometric absorbance of the samples was recorded using Microplate Reader
  (Bio-Rad Model 680, Hercules, CA) at 405 nm.
- 'Percent apoptosis was calculated using the formula: (100×treatment cell absorbance/control
  cell absorbance)−100.'
- The statistical significance of differences between the values of treated samples
  and controls were determined with Kruskal-Wallis with Dunn's post test using GraphPad
  Prism version 4.00 for Windows, GraphPad Software, San Diego, California, USA (www.graphpad.com).
- In each case, _P_&lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant.
- First to examine whether GTPs and SFN have any synergistic cellular proliferation
  inhibitory activity on human breast cancer cells, we performed cell viability assay
  with GTP and SFN alone or in combination treatments for 3 days.
- We intended to determine the optimal dose that will induce ERα transcriptional activation
  without causing cellular toxicity, thereby studying possible mechanisms involved
  in the ERα-reactivation in ERα-negative MDA-MB-231 cells.
- The MTT-cell viability assay was performed with the MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-453 cells
  treated with various concentrations of GTPs and SFN alone or in combinations as
  shown in Fig.
- 1_A_.
- We observed a dose-dependent cell growth inhibition with GTPs and SFN treatments
  in both ER-negative MDA-MB-453 and MDA-MB-231 cells, which became significant at
  80 µg/ml and 40 µM, respectively.
- However, the combination of GTPs and SFN synergistically induced cell growth inhibition
  at 20 µg/ml GTPs and 10 µM SFN in these ERα-negative cells.
- The synergistic cell growth inhibitory effects were well pronounced at higher doses
  of GTPs and SFN.
- Further, MDA-MB-231 showed less cellular viability inhibitory effect than MDA-MB-453
  at indicated GTPs and SFN doses, which might be due to the triple-negative in nature.
- Therefore, for further studies we chose MDA-MB-231 cells with minimum effect and
  triple-negative in nature; thereby we can study the mechanisms without toxicity.
- Control MCF10A cells were slightly inhibited in cell growth with combination of
  40 µg/ml GTPs and 20 µM SFN after 3 days of treatment, indicating that higher combination
  doses might be toxic to the normal breast cells (Fig.
- 1_B_).
- These results indicate that lower doses of combined GTPs and SFN selectively inhibit
  ERα-negative breast cancer cells; however, the optimal doses required for the transcriptional
  activation of ERα remained to be determined in our subsequent studies.
- Figure 1.
- Combined GTPs and SFN synergistically inhibit cellular proliferation of ERα-negative
  breast cancer cells but has negligible effect on control MCF10A cells.
- Human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-453 cells (panel _A_), and control MCF10A
  (_panel B_) cells were treated with varying concentrations of GTPs (0–80 µg/mL)
  and SFN (0–40 µM) as well as a combination of both the compounds for 3 days.
- Percent cell viability was obtained using MTT assay as described under _Materials
  and Methods_.
- Results were obtained from three independent experiments, mean ± SD.
- Statistical significance, P&lt;0.05.
- To determine the optimal dose of GTPs and SFN for the ERα reactivation, MDA-MB-231
  cells were treated with increasing concentrations of GTPs and SFN for 3 days as
  shown in Fig.
- 2_A_.
- GTPs induced _ERα_ mRNA expression at a concentration as low as 10 µg/ml, but the
  maximum significant effect was observed at 20 µg/ml.
- Similarly, SFN induced significant _ERα_ expression starting from 5 µM and the maximum
  _ERα_ reactivation was observed at 10 µM doses.
- Furthermore, in combination treatments, 20 µg/ml GTPs and 5 µM SFN were shown to
  induce optimal significant synergistic reactivation of _ERα_ mRNA in ERα-negative
  MDA-MB-231 cells after 24 h of post-treatment compared to non-treated control (Fig.
- 2_B_).
- However, although SFN at 10 µM alone achieved the maximum significant _ERα_ reactivation
  in MDA-MB-231 cells, in combination with GTPs the optimal doses of SFN was found
  to be 5 µM (Fig.
- 2_B_).
- Further, the combination of 20 µg/ml GTPs and 5 µM SFN at 72 h post-treatment with
  MDA-MB-231 cells induced a significant (P&lt;0.001) _ERα_ reactivation compared
  to the respective individual doses of GTPs and SFN at 72 h (Fig.
- 2_B_).
- Western blot analysis showed that the combination of GTPs and SFN significantly
  reactivated ERα protein expression in ERα-negative MDA-MB-231 cells after 24 h of
  post-treatment (Fig.
- 2_C_).
- The ERα reactivation was considerably higher at 72 h of post-combinational doses
  of 20 µg/ml GTPs and 5 µM SFN in MDA-MB-231 cells.
- These results indicated that the low concentrations of GTPs and SFN did not induce
  significant cellular toxicity, but induced transcriptional and translational reactivation
  of ERα expression in the ERα-negative human breast cancer cells.
- Based on these results, we therefore chose to use the concentrations of GTPs and
  SFN as optimized in Fig.
- 2 for subsequent experiments.
- Figure 2.
- GTPs and SFN synergistically reactivated ERα expression in ERα-negative human breast
  cancer cells.
- _A)_ GTPs and SFN at indicated doses induced ERα re-expression in ERα-negative MDA-MB-231
  human breast cancer cells after 72 h of post-treatments.
- _B)_ Treatment with GTPs or SFN and a combination of both of the compounds at indicated
  doses induced ERα re-expression in ERα-negative human breast cancer cells.
- Relative mRNA levels of _ERα_ in GTPs and SFN treated cells were quantified at 12,
  24, 48 and 72 h using real-time PCR.
- Data are in triplicates from three independent experiments and were normalized to
  _GAPDH_.
- The values were plotted against control as relative fold induction ± SD.
- Significance against nontreated control, P&lt;0.05, P&lt;0.001; aP&lt;0.05 against
  individual GTPs and SFN doses at the same time interval.
- _C)_ ERα protein expression with the treatment of GTPs or SFN alone or in combination
  at 12, 24, 48 and 72 h in MDA-MB-231 cells.
- ERα-positive MCF-7 cells served as a positive control.
- Actin was used as an equal loading control.
- Previous studies have shown that ERα activation is associated with DNA methylation
  and histone modifications; we therefore assessed epigenetic-modulating enzymatic
  activity of the DNMTs (Fig.
- 3_A_), HDACs (Fig.
- 3_B_), HATs (Fig.
- 3_B_) and DNMTs as well as HDACs expression (Fig.
- 3_C_) in ERα-negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, using GTPs and SFN treatments.
- Interestingly, GTPs and SFN significantly reduced HATs and HDACs activities, respectively,
  at the optimal doses used as shown in Fig.
- 3_B_.
- This is in accordance with previous studies that EGCG has a HAT inhibitory activity,
  and SFN poses a HDACs inhibitory activity [16], [18], [24].
- However, the combination of GTPs with SFN additively enhanced HDACs inhibitory activity
  of SFN in MDA-MB-231 cells but not HATs inhibitory activity.
- Further, HDAC expression analysis showed that the combination of GTPs with SFN considerably
  inhibits HDAC1, HDAC4 and HDAC6 expression in MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig.
- 3_C_), in accordance with HDAC inhibitory activity observed in Fig.
- 3_B_.
- It is known that EGCG, an active compound present in GTPs, is a DNMTs inhibitor;
  similarly we have also observed that GTPs treatment considerably inhibited DNMTs
  activity and expression in MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig.
- 3_A and 3D_).
- Interestingly, we found that SFN, a HDACs inhibitor, also inhibits DNMTs activity
  significantly in MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig.
- 3_A_).
- The combinations of GTPs and SFN have more pronounced DNMTs inhibitory effects than
  when administrated separately.
- The combination doses mediated inhibition of DNMTs expression could be an important
  contributing factor in altering the binding of MBD-proteins at the _ERα_ promoter.
- To our surprise, not only DNMTs but also histone methyltransferase, SUV39H1, is
  also inhibited by GTPs and SFN (Fig.
- 3_C_).
- The GTPs- and SFN-mediated inhibition of DNMTs and SUV39H1 expressions could be
  an important contributing factor in facilitating demethylation of the _ERα_ promoter,
  which leads to transcriptional activation of ERα expression [8], [25].
- Figure 3.
- GTPs and SFN altered epigenetic enzymes expression and their activity in ERα-negative
  breast cancer cells.
- Breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with the indicated concentration of
  GTPs and SFN alone or in combinations of both for 3 days.
- Nuclear extracts were prepared and 20 µg of protein was used to estimate DNMTs (_panel
  A_), HDAC and HATs (_panel B_) activities using the colorimetric assay kit as described
  under _Materials and Methods_.
- Non-treated MCF-7 cells were used as a positive control.
- Values are representative of three independent experiments and represented as percent
  control ± SD; statistical significance against nontreated MDA-MB-231 control, P&lt;0.05.

  by western blotting to analyze DNMTs (DNMT1, DNMT3a and DNMT3b), HDACs (HDAC1, HDAC4
  and HDAC6) and SUV39H1 expression.
- Non-treated MCF-7 cells were used as a positive control.

- Values are mean band intensity of three independent blot ± SD.
- It is well known that histone modifications and DNA methylation play important roles
  in gene expression and regulation, especially in ERα activation in breast cancer
  cells [4], [25].
- Our studies have shown that treatment with the GTPs and SFN significantly altered
  the activity as well as expression of epigenetic modulating enzymes in ERα-negative
  MDA-MB-231 cells, suggesting a potential role of histone modifications and DNA methylation
  in ERα regulations.
- Therefore, we sought to determine changes in histone modifications of the _ER_α
  promoter by GTPs and SFN treatment by different time intervals in MDA-MB-231 cells.
- We found that GTPs and SFN treatment can increase considerable enrichment of three
  histone acetylation chromatin markers, acetyl H3 (ac-H3), acetyl-H3 at lysine 9
  (ac-H3K9) and ac-H4 in MDA-MB-231 cells after 48 h of post-treatment (Fig.
- 4_A_).
- We also found a decrease in the methylation status of inactive histone markers such
  as trimethyl-H3 lysine 9 (tri-me-H3K9) in MDA-MB-231 cells with GTPs and SFN treatments
  (Fig.
- 4_A_).
- Further, a significantly enriched level of histone acetylation and decreased tri-me-H3K9
  was more pronounced in the combination treatments of GTPs and SFN at 48 h and 72
  h, suggesting the importance of dietary combination-induced ERα-reactivation in
  ERα-negative breast cancer cells through histone modifications (Fig.
- 4_A_).
- These changes of histone acetylation and deacetylation allow transcriptional factors
  binding into the _ER_ regulatory region by maintaining a repressive environment
  [2], [7].
- Figure 4.
- GTPs and SFN altered _ERα_ promoter methylation and histone acetylations in MDA-MB-231
  cells.
- _A)_ MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with GTPs and SFN alone, and in combinations
  as indicated for 24, 48 and 72 h. Histone modifications were analyzed by ChIP-qPCR
  using chromatin markers including acetyl-H3, trimethyl-H3K9, acetyl-H3K9 and acetyl-H4
  in the promoter region of _ERα_.
- Mouse IgG antibody controls were assessed to verify the ChIP efficiency.
- The x-axis represents the different treatment groups, and the y-axis represents
  the relative enrichment of individual binding factors [the percentage of immunoprecipitates
  compared with the corresponding input samples (defined as 100)].
- The experiment was repeated 3 times with triplicates in real-time PCR, and each
  point indicates the mean ± SD.
- Significance against nontreated MDA-MB-231 control, P&lt;0.05.
- _B)_ GTPs and SFN altered _ERα_ promoter DNA methylation in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer
  cells as assayed by bisulfite sequencing.
- MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with the indicated concentration of GTPs and SFN for
  24 h, 48 h and 72 h. Percent methylation was obtained by dividing the number of
  methylated CpGs by the total number of CpGs (29) in the indicated _ERα_ promoter
  region assessed.
- Values are representative of three independent experiments and are represented as
  percent control ± SD; statistical significance, P&lt;0.05.
- _C)_ The _ERα_ promoter region used for bisulfite sequencing is shown with PCR primer
  sequences, number of CpGs and the total amplification lengths.
- Since the _ERα_ promoter is mostly hypermethylated in ERα-negative breast cancer
  cells, we assessed the methylation status of the _ERa_ promoter region from −66
  to +356 covering 29 CpG dinucleotides and various overlapping transcription factor
  binding sites for 24 h, 48 h and 72 h (Fig.
- 4_B_).
- We used bisulfite-sequencing to detect the _ERa_ methylation patterns of GTPs and
  SFN treated MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells.
- Untreated MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells served as controls.
- As shown in Fig.
- 4_B_, control MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells maintain a high level of methylation
  at promoter sites at 54.02±2.36%.
- Although we found considerable inhibition in DNMTs expression levels with GTPs and
  SFN treatments, we did not find any significant changes in methylation status of
  the _ERα_ promoter with GTPs and SFN treated MDA-MB-231 compared with untreated
  MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig.
- _4B_).
- This is in accordance with our previous study that EGCG treatment does not induce
  significant methylation changes in the CpG islands of the _ERα_ promoter in MDA-MB-231
  cells [4].
- In contrast, combination treatments of GTPs with SFN significantly reduced _ERα_
  promoter methylation after 48 h post-treatment as we observed previously in combination
  of EGCG with Trichostatin A (TSA), a histone deacetylase inhibitor, in MDA-MB-231
  cells [4].
- Our results indicated that only combined treatments of GTPs and SFN can induce significant
  DNA hypomethylation at the _ERα_ promoter.
- In summary, these results suggest that histone modifications and DNA methylation
  contribute a major role in GTPs and SFN induced _ERα_ reactivation in ERα-negative
  human breast cancer cells.
- Given the strong link between histone modification and DNA methylation, we asked
  whether GTP- and SFN-induced ERα re-expression is associated with reorganization
  of heterochromatin structure at the epigenetically regulated _ERα_ promoter in MDA-MB-231
  cells.
- Studies have shown that HDAC repressor complex, HDAC1 and DNMT1 involves gene silencing
  by recruiting co-repressor complexes to the methylated _ERα_ promoter [26].
- Studies have also shown that disruption of transcriptional repressor multi-molecular
  complex, HDAC1/DNMT1/SUV39H1, is associated with ERα transcriptional activation
  in ERα-negative breast cancer cells [8].
- Therefore, ChIP-assays were performed to examine GTPs- and SFN-mediated changes
  in these transcriptional repressor complexes binding on the _ERα_ promoter.
- As shown in Fig.
- 5_A–B_, GTPs and SFN can considerably lower the binding of these transcriptional
  repressor multi-molecular complexes to the _ERα_ promoter and this effect was significant
  when treated with GTPs and SFN in combinations.
- Further, GTPs and SFN combination treatment also significantly disrupted binding
  of methyl-CpG binding domain (MBD) proteins, MeCP2 and MBD1, to the _ERα_ promoter,
  might be due to the hypomethylation induced by GTPs and SFN at the _ERα_ promoter
  (Fig.
- 5_A–B_).
- Collectively, these data suggest that the binding alterations of transcriptional
  repressor complex to the _ERα_ promoter contributed to the reactivation of ERα by
  the combination of dietary DNMT and HDAC inhibitors, GTPs and SFN, respectively.
- Figure 5.
- GTPs and SFN altered binding of transcriptional factors to the _ERα_ promoter in
  ERα-negative breast cancer cells.
- _A)_ MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with GTPs or SFN and a combination of both of
  the compounds as indicated for 3 days.
- Samples were prepared for ChIP-assay and analyzed for the binding of ERα transcription
  repressor proteins including HDAC1, DNMT1, MeCP2, MBD1 and SUV39H1 together with
  mouse IgG control.
- MCF-7 served as a positive control.
- PCR primers and conditions were used as described in _Materials and Methods_.
- Photographs are representative of an experiment that was repeated in triplicates.
- _B)_ ChIP data were calculated from the corresponding DNA fragments amplified by
  PCR using Kodak 1D 3.6.1 image software; columns, mean; bars, SD; statistical significance,
  P&lt;0.05.
- The relative binding ratio was calculated as the ratio between the net intensity
  of each bound sample divided by the input and the untreated control sample divided
  by the input (bound/input)/(control/input).
- Studies have shown that EGCG can induce hypomethylation in various cell lines either
  by direct or indirect inhibition of DNA methyltransferases [13], [14], [27].
- We previously discovered that SFN can also induce hypomethylation at the regulatory
  region of _hTERT_ through inhibition of DNMTs expressions [18].
- Therefore, we sought to determine the cause of GTPs and SFN treatment on global
  methylation status in ERα-negative MDA-MB-231 cells.
- We performed 5-methyl-cytosine (5-mC) immunostaining and dot-blot analysis to examine
  GTPs and SFN altered global methylation in MDA-MB-231 cells.
- As shown in Fig.
- 6_A_, GTPs-treatment considerably reduced 5-mC positive staining compared with control
  cells.
- The effect of demethylation was predominant in combination treatment of GTPs with
  SFN in MDA-MB-231 cells.
- The results were further semi-quantitatively analyzed by dot-blot analysis (Fig.
- 6_B_).
- Treatment of GTPs resulted in a significant reduction in 5-mC levels in MDA-MB-231
  cells compared with untreated MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig.
- 6_C_).
- However, combined treatment of GTPs with SFN significantly reduced 5-mC expression
  in MDA-MB-231 cells, resulting in a synergistic global hypomethylation in CpG dinuclotides.
- These results suggest that GTPs may have a broad effect on DNA demethylation and
  this might be further accelerated by combination with SFN as observed in this study.
- Figure 6.
- GTPs and SFN induced global hypomethylation in ERα-negative breast cancer cells.
- MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with GTPs or SFN and combination of both the compounds
  as indicated for 3 days and analyzed for 5-methycytosine (5-mC).
- _A)_ Immunocytochemical detection of DNA methylation using a 5-mC-specific antibody
  and counterstained with methyl green.
- 5-mC-positive staining is shown as dark brown.
- Magnification ×400.
- Photomicrographs are representative of three independent experiments.
- _B)_ Cellular DNA was extracted and dot-blot analysis was performed for the presence
  of 5-mC.
- MCF-7 cells were used as a positive control and a no-DNA sample was used as a negative
  control.
- _C)_ Graphical representations are indicative of relative band intensity of 5-mC
  expression in breast cancer cells as shown.
- Values are mean band intensity of three independent blot ± SD; statistical significance,
  P&lt;0.05.
- Collectively our aforementioned observations conclude that the combination of dietary
  DNMT and HDAC inhibitors, GTPs and SFN, respectively, epigenetically reactivates
  ERα expression in ERα-negative MDA-MB-231 cells.
- Furthermore, we sought to determine whether the ERα-reactivation could be used along
  with available SERMs such as tamoxifen therapy in hormonal refractory breast cancer.
- We therefore investigated the changes in cellular viability and apoptosis in ERα-negative
  MDA-MB-231 cells treated with GTPs and SFN alone or in combinations along with tamoxifen
  (TAM).
- As shown in Fig.
- 7_A_, untreated MDA-MB-231 cells showed an increased cellular proliferation with
  17β-estradiol (E2), an ERα-ligand activator.
- Treatments with GTPs and 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (AZC), a DNMT inhibitor, alone or
  in combinations with TAM did not inhibit significant cellular proliferation in MDA-MB-231
  cells, which is likely due to the limited ERα reactivations.
- However, MDA-MB-231 cells treated with SFN and TSA combined with TAM had significantly
  reduced cellular proliferation, likely due to the pronounced effect of histone modifications
  as well as DNA demethylation-mediated _ERα_ activation in MDA-MB-231 cells.
- Furthermore, combined treatment of GTP and SFN with TAM showed a significantly greater
  effect in reducing cellular proliferation in ERα-negative MDA-MB-231 cells.
- GTPs and SFN combined with TAM had pronounced cellular proliferation inhibitory
  effect than the combination of synthetic DNMT inhibitor, AZC, and HDAC inhibitor,
  TSA, along with TAM (Fig.
- 7_A_).
- It was found that MDA-MB-231 cells treated with 20 µg/mL GTPs and 10 µM SFN induced
  a considerable level of cellular apoptosis in both control as well as ERα-knockdown
  cells.
- Furthermore, combined treatment with GTP and SFN showed a significantly higher apoptosis
  in both control siRNA as well as ERα-knockdown siRNA cells (P&lt;0.05) (Fig.
- 7_B_).
- MDA-MB-231 cells treated with GTPs and SFN combined with TAM had significantly higher
  cellular apoptosis (P&lt;0.01).
- Conversely, ERα knockdown MDA-MB-231 cells treated with GTPs and SFN combined with
  TAM induced a significantly lesser apoptosis than control siRNA treated MDA-MB-231
  cells (P&lt;0.05).
- This might be the fact that GTPs and SFN induced cellular apoptosis in MDA-MB-231
  cells in both ERα-dependent as well as ERα-independent mechanisms.
- However, TAM required ERα-reactivation to induce significant level of apoptosis
  in ERα-negative MDA-MB-231 cells at the low dose used.
- Collectively, these results indicated that the combination of GTPs and SFN can induce
  functional ERα re-expression and re-sensitize ERα-negative breast cancer cells to
  available SERM, TAM, which could provide an extremely important clinical implication
  in potential application of combination of bioactive dietary supplements as a therapeutic
  strategy for hormonal refractory breast cancer.
- Figure 7.
- Combined treatments of GTPs and SFN sensitize ERα-negative breast cancer cells for

- MDA-MB-231 cells treated with GTPs and SFN together with tamoxifen induced cellular
  apoptosis and inhibited cellular proliferation.
- _A)_ ERα-negative MDA-MB-231 cellular viability in response to estradiol (10 nM)
  or tamoxifen (1 µM) alone, or in combination with GTP and SFN for 3 days.
- For a comparison, DNMTs inhibitor, AZC (2.5 µM), and HDAC inhibitor, TSA (100 ng),
  also administrated to MDA-MB-231 cells.
- Cell viability was determined and plotted against percent control.
- Data were obtained from three independent experiments, mean ± SD.
- Statistical significance, P&lt;0.05; P&lt;0.01.
- _B)_ Knockdown of ERα decreases GTPs- and SFN-sensitized, TAM-induced apoptosis
  in ERα-negative MDA-MB-231 cells.
- MDA-MB-231 cells were subjected to treatment with 9 nM ERα-siRNA or control-siRNA.
- Cells were further treated with GTPs and SFN in combinations with or without TAM
  as indicated for 72 h. The cells were lysed with nuclear lysis buffer and analyzed
  for apoptosis as described in _Materials and Methods_.
- Values are representative of three independent experiments.
- Significance, P&lt;0.05; P&lt;0.01.
- _C)_ Effect of siRNA interference with _ERα_ gene expression was assayed after 72
  h using specific antibodies to ERα and β-actin by western blot analysis.
- For ERα reactivation, 20 µg/mL GTPs and 5 µM SFN were used for 72 hrs.
- Data shown are representative of the three separate experiments.
- Epigenetic regulation has attracted considerable interest as a molecular target
  for cancer prevention and therapy as well as a target of many bioactive dietary
  components.
- Growing evidence suggests that bioactive dietary components impact epigenetic processes
  often involved with silencing of tumor suppressor genes, activation of cell survival
  proteins and induction of cellular apoptosis in many types of cancer [4], [15],
  [28], [29].
- GTPs and SFN have been found to have anti-cancer properties in various cancers through
  genetic and epigenetic mechanisms [11], [12], [14], [16].
- The most abundant bioactive compound present in GTPs is catechins, which include
  (–)-epicatechin (EC), (–)-epicatechin-3-gallate (ECG), (–)-epigallocatechin (EGC)
  and (–)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) [12], [30].
- Of these, EGCG accounts for more than 50% of the total polyphenol and effective
  content in green tea [31].
- EGCG, a well studied green tea polyphenol, has DNMTs inhibitory activity, however,
  other catechins in GTPs such as (–)-epicatechin (EC), (–)-epicatechin-3-gallate
  (ECG) and (–)-epigallocatechin (EGC) have also been found to share similar properties
  although they are less efficient than EGCG [13], [32].
- Therefore, the use of GTPs as a whole not only mimics the natural environment but
  also enhances its synergistic epigenetic activity against various cancers including
  breast cancer.
- Another bioactive dietary supplement used in this study is sulforaphane (SFN), an
  isothiocyanate naturally abundant in widely consumed cruciferous vegetables, found
  to have HDACs inhibitory activity [16], [17].
- Therefore the focus of the current study is the use of combined dietary DNMT and
  HDAC inhibitors for the prevention and therapeutics of hormonal refractory breast
  cancer.
- The epigenetics of ERα re-expression in ERα-negative breast cancer cells has been
  studied in many laboratories, including our laboratory, and has been of intense
  interest as a novel strategy for the treatment of hormonal refractory breast cancer
  [4], [7], [25].
- Since ERα-negative tumors are difficult to treat with available SERMs due to the
  lack of hormonal receptor, it is very crucial to formulate a new treatment strategy
  for this type of hormonal refractory breast cancer.
- Many studies have advanced our knowledge that treatment with AZC, a DNMT inhibitor,
  and TSA, a HDAC inhibitor, can reactivate ER expression in ER-negative breast cancer
  cells, suggesting that epigenetic mechanisms play an important role in _ERα_ transcriptional
  regulations [7], [9], [25].
- However, the use of synthetic molecules might induce potential adverse side effects
  and higher cost.
- Therefore, the use of bioactive dietary supplements as DNMT and HDAC inhibitors
  for the reactivation of ER-expression in ER-negative breast cancer could greatly
  mimic more natural dietary milieu, reduced treatment cost and most importantly minimum
  adverse effects.
- In the present study, we provided evidences that the combination of GTPs and SFN
  can induce re-expression of endogenous ERα in ERα-negative MDA-MB-231 human breast
  cancer cells.
- For the first time, our results demonstrate that the reactivation of ERα by GTPs
  and SFN is mediated, at least partly, through the epigenetic alterations in DNA
  methylation and chromatin remodeling in _ERα_ gene promoter.
- Recent evidences suggest that epigenetic regulation is one of the most important
  molecular events associated with _ERα_ silencing in ERα-negative breast cancers
  [2], [7], [9].
- Recently, extensive studies have focused on EGCG, a major component in GTPs, mediated
  DNMTs and HAT inhibitory activity in various cancer cells, including breast cancer
  cells [13], [21], [24].
- Besides direct inhibition of DNMT by EGCG, it was also reported that consumption
  of GTPs could lead to a decrease in available S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) and
  an increase in _S_-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (SAH) and homocysteine levels, thereby
  providing evidence of an indirect inhibition of DNA methylation by EGCG/GTPs [27].
- This conjecture is supported by animal studies demonstrating that GTPs consumption
  through drinking water can moderately decrease the level of SAM in the intestine
  [14].
- Beside HDAC inhibitory activity of SFN, we also observed DNMTs inhibitory activity
  in human breast cancer cells.
- This is in accordance with earlier findings that SFN-treatment significantly inhibited
  HDAC activity and DNMTs expression in breast cancer cells; however, we did not find
  any significant alteration in HAT activity [18].
- Several studies have reported that DNA methylation and histone acetylation play
  important roles in _ER_ transcriptional regulation [7]–[9], [25].
- Together, our results suggest that GTPs and SFN-induced down-regulation of DNMTs
  expression and histone modifications is not only causing a repressive environment
  at the _ERα_ promoter but also altered the binding of transcriptional repressor
  complex at the _ERα_ promoter.
- This is confirmed further with our ChIP-analysis that GTPs- and SFN-induced enrichment
  of transcriptional active chromatin markers such as acetylated histone H3, H3K9
  and acetyl-H4 in ER-negative MDA-MB-231 cells, whereas chromatin inactive markers
  such as trimethyl-H3K9 was decreased.
- Importantly, we found that the histone H3K9 methyltransferase, SUV39H1, was released
  from the _ER_-promoter since presence of SUV39H1 has been shown to be crucial for
  maintenance of the H3-methylation and epigenetic control of heterochromatin assembly
  in cancer cells [33], [34].
- In accordance, we found that GTPs- and SFN-mediated release of SUV39H1 protein from
  _ER_ promoter leads to suppression of trimethyl-H3K9 methylation in ER-negative
  MDA-MB-231 cells.
- Studies have shown that CpG methylation of the _ERα_ promoter results in transcriptional
  _ER_ silencing [26].
- We found that bioactive dietary DNA demethylating and histone deacetylating agents
  such as GTPs and SFN can alter the binding of methyl-CpG binding proteins, DNMT
  and HDAC, which are actively involved in _ERα_ transcriptional regulations [2],
  [7].
- Further our results demonstrate that combinations of GTPs and SFN induced the release
  of co-repressor complexes to the demethylated _ERα_ promoter and the disruption
  of transcriptional repressor multi-molecular complex, HDAC1/DNMT1/SUV39H1, is actively
  associated with ERα transcriptional activation in ERα-negative breast cancer cells
  [8].
- Further, it is also reported that release of co-repressor complex leads to concomitant
  enrichment of ac-H3, ac-H3K9 and ac-H4 [7].
- Besides gene specific DNA demethylations, we also observed a global DNA hypomethylation
  by GTPs and SFN in MDA-MB-231 cells.
- This might be due to the GTPs- and SFN-mediated DNMTs inhibition in these human
  breast cancer cells [15], [18], [21].
- Taken together, it is apparent that DNMTs-induced promoter demethylation and HDAC-associated
  chromatin remodelling altered binding of transcriptional repressor multi-molecular
  complex, which is closely, linked to the ERα re-activation by GTPs and SFN in ERα-negative
  human breast cancer cells.
- In our potential application study, we have clearly demonstrated that GTPs and SFN-mediated
  ERα-reactivation can be utilized for the treatment with available SERMs, tamoxifen
  in ERα-negative breast cancer cells.
- For the first time we demonstrated that the combination of bioactive dietary supplements,
  GTPs and SFN can reactivate ERα-expression in ERα-negative breast cancer cells through
  DNA demethylation and histone modifications associated epigenetic alterations.
- These findings are of importance not only for understanding epigenetic regulation
  of the _ERα_ gene but also to provide evidence for the combined anticancer mechanism
  of bioactive dietary DNMT and HDAC inhibitors in cancer prevention and therapy.
- In conclusion, our results suggest that the combination of dietary bioactive supplements
  GTPs and SFN could enhance the possible novel treatment strategy for hormonal refractory
  breast tumors.
- Further, epigenetic regulation of ERα re-activation by combination of GTPs and SFN
  could help in designing novel therapeutic strategies.
- However, further studies with _in vivo_ transgenic models such as C3(1)/SV40 and
  Her2/neu are necessary to validate our observations during different stages of breast
  cancer progression.
- These _in vivo_ mouse models can produce ER-negative breast tumors which closely
  resemble the development, progression and morphology of human breast tumors [35],
  [36].
- These _in vivo_ models can be manipulated to use for ER-reactivation studies by
  potential bioactive dietary supplements with more close resemblance to humans for
  the treatment of hormonal refractory breast cancer in combination with available
  SERMs.
