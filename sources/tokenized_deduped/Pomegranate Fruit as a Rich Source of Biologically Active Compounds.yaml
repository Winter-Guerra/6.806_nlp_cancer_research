- Pomegranate is a widely used plant having medicinal properties.
- In this review, we have mainly focused on the already published data from our laboratory
  pertaining to the effect of methanol extract of pericarp of pomegranate (PME) and
  have compared it with other relevant literatures on _Punica_.
- Earlier, we had shown its antiproliferative effect using human breast (MCF-7, MDA
  MB-231), and endometrial (HEC-1A), cervical (SiHa, HeLa), and ovarian (SKOV3) cancer
  cell lines, and normal breast fibroblasts (MCF-10A) at concentration of 20–320 _μ_g/mL.
- The expressions of selected estrogen responsive genes (PR, pS2, and C-Myc) were
  downregulated by PME.
- Unlike estradiol, PME did not increase the uterine weight and proliferation in bilaterally
  ovariectomized Swiss-Albino mice models and its cardioprotective effects were comparable
  to that of 17_β_-estradiol.
- We had further assessed the protective role of PME on skeletal system, using MC3T3-E1
  cells.
- The results indicated that PME (80 _μ_g/mL) significantly increased ALP (Alkaline
  Phosphatase) activity, supporting its suggested role in modulating osteoblastic
  cell differentiation.
- The antiosteoporotic potential of PME was also evaluated in ovariectomized (OVX)
  rodent model.
- The results from our studies and from various other studies support the fact that
  pomegranate fruit is indeed a source of biologically active compounds.
- _Punica granatum _L.
- (Punicaceae) is a nutrient dense fruit rich in phytochemical compounds [1].
- Plants produce low molecular weight compounds which are broadly called phytochemicals,
  usually as a mechanism of defence.
- Some plants contain distinct families of phytocompounds, which are structurally
  similar to steroid hormone, 17_β_-estradiol (E2) and compete with the endogenous
  hormone for binding to estrogen receptor (ER), thus reducing the hormonal effect
  of endogenous estrogens [2–4].
- These compounds are termed as phytoestrogens.
- Most of these phytoestrogens present in the diet are inactive compounds, which,
  on consumption, go through series of enzymatic changes in the gastrointestinal tract,
  resulting in the formation of compounds having structure similar to that of estrogens
  [5].
- Phytoestrogens have captured major research and clinical attention due to its effectiveness
  in the prevention and treatment of perimenopausal and menopausal symptoms, over
  hormone replacement therapy (HRT) [6].
- They may act both as agonists and/or antagonists in a site-specific manner, similar
  to the hormonal action of selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) [7–9].
- It can also function as antioxidants and protect DNA from oxidant-induced damage
  [10].
- Research on pomegranate is gaining momentum due to its tremendous nutritional values
  and medicinal uses.
- The current review focuses on the use of pomegranate as a phytoestrogen rich and
  nutraceutical fruit with emphasis to the work done in our laboratory using methanolic
  extract of pericarp of pomegranate (PME).
- The chemical composition of the fruits differs depending on the cultivar, growing
  region, maturity, cultivation practice, climate, and storage circumstances [11].
- About 50% of the total fruit weight corresponds to the peel, which is an important
  source of bioactive compounds such as phenolics, flavonoids, ellagitannins, and
  proanthocyanidin compounds, minerals, mainly potassium, nitrogen, calcium, phosphorus,
  magnesium, and sodium, and complex polysaccharides.
- The edible part of the pomegranate fruit (50%) consists of 40% arils and 10% seeds.
- Arils contain 85% water, 10% total sugars, mainly fructose and glucose, and 1.5%
  pectin, organic acid, such as ascorbic acid, citric acid, and malic acid, and bioactive
  compounds such as phenolics and flavonoids, principally anthocyanins [12].
- The seed cover of the fruit contains delphinidin-3-glucoside, cyanidin-3-glucoside,
  delphinidin-3,5-diglucoside, cyanidin-3,5-diglucoside, pelargonidin-3,5-diglucoside,
  and pelargonidin-3-glucoside with delphinidin-3,5-diglucoside being the main anthocyanin
  in pomegranate juice [13].
- 12–20% of total seed weight of pomegranate comprises seed oil and is self-possessed
  with more than 70% of the conjugated linolenic acids.
- The fatty acid component of pomegranate seed oil comprises over 95% of the oil,
  of which 99% is triacylglycerols.
- Minor components of the oil include sterols, steroids, and a key component of mammalian
  myelin sheaths, cerebroside [14, 15].
- Interestingly, punicic acid, which is a conjugated isomer unique to pomegranate
  oil, constitutes 70–76% of the seed oil [16].
- Phenolic compounds, together with flavonoids, anthocyanins, and tannins, are the
  main group of antioxidant phytochemicals that are important due to their biological
  and free radical scavenging activities [17].
- Phenolic acids, flavonoids, and tannins are present in different parts of pomegranate
  fruit and this may be one of the reasons why many of the studies demonstrated that
  combinations of pomegranate extracts from different parts of the fruit were more
  effective than a single extract [18].
- In a comparative analysis, anthocyanins from pomegranate fruit were found to possess
  higher antioxidant activity than vitamin-E (_α_-tocopherol), _β_-carotene, and ascorbic
  acid [19].
- Table 1 represents the key constituents of pomegranate fruit and tree [20–41].
- 'Table 1: Principal constituents of different parts of pomegranate tree and fruit.'
- The different parts of pomegranate plant like peel, root, bark, flower, leaves,
  and so forth exhibit different phytochemicals.
- Extracts of all parts of the pomegranate fruit exhibit therapeutic properties [15]
  and target a range of diseases including cancer, cardiovascular disorders, diabetes,
  male infertility, Alzheimer’s disease [42], aging, and AIDS [43] (Figure 1).
- Although pomegranate’s extensive therapeutic benefits may be attributed to a number
  of mechanisms, most researchers have determined its antioxidant, anticarcinogenic,
  and anti-inflammatory properties.
- Various therapeutic applications of_ Punica granatum_ are discussed here.
- 'Figure 1: Therapeutically beneficial uses of_ Punica_ fruit.'
- Pomegranate fruit has been proven to act against various diseases like cancer, cardiovascular
  disorders, diabetes, AIDS, and Alzheimer’s disease.
- Research on breast cancer cell lines demonstrated that pomegranate constituents
  efficiently inhibited angiogenesis [44], invasiveness [40], growth [45], and induced
  apoptosis [46].
- Its anti-invasive, antiproliferative, and antimetastatic effects were attributed
  to the modulation of Bcl-2 proteins, upregulation of p27 and p21, and downregulation
  of cyclin-cdk network [47].
- Pomegranate constituents inhibit angiogenesis via downregulation of vascular endothelial
  growth factor (VEGF) in human umbilical vein endothelial and MCF-7 breast cancer
  cell lines [44], thereby hampering the tumor growth.
- Prostate cancer cells, when treated with pomegranate juice, increased adhesion and
  decreased the migration.
- Molecular analyses revealed that pomegranate juice increased the expression of cell-adhesion
  related genes and inhibited the expression of genes involved in cytoskeletal function
  and cellular migration.
- It would possibly affect prostate cancer because of its apoptotic, antioxidant,
  antiproliferative, and anti-inflammatory properties, suggesting that it may be beneficial
  in slowing down or preventing cancer cell metastasis [48].
- The application of pomegranate extract to the skin of mice before they were exposed
  to a carcinogenic agent was shown to inhibit the appearance of erythemas and hyperplasia
  and the activity of epithelial ornithine decarboxylase [49].
- An_ in vivo_ study in TRAMP mice model suggested that oral supplementation of pomegranate
  fruit extract inhibited metastasis and increased overall survival [50].
- Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are good markers of tumor cell invasion and migration
  [51].
- Phytochemicals have been shown to target the activity and secretion of MMPs in estrogen
  responsive cancers [52].
- Constituents of pomegranate minimize tumor cell invasion into normal tissue and
  metastasis to distant sites and these actions develop due to the inhibition of selected
  metalloproteinase activity, decreased focal adhesion kinase activity, and reduced
  VEGF expression [15].
- With semiquantitative RT-PCR, we had found out that PME downregulated the transcription
  of MMP-9 suggesting its possible role in the inhibition of tumor invasion (Figure
  2) whereas E2 (10 nM) did not significantly affect the transcription of MMP-9 [53]
  which correlated with earlier studies suggesting that estrogen stimulated MMP-9
  secretion without increasing its gene transcription [54].
- 'Figure 2: Effect of PME on MMP-9 transcription in MCF7 cells.'
- (a) MCF7 cells were incubated with PME (40, 80, and 160 _μ_g/mL) and E2 (10 nM)
  for 24 hrs and semiquantitative RT-PCR was done.
- (b) shows the ratio of density of MMP-9 gene expression to that of endogenous control
  GAPDH and it represents mean ± SE of 3 replicates ( ).
- We had assessed the estrogenicity/antiestrogenicity of PME in a panel of_ in vitro_
  biological assays and the expression of endogenous estrogen sensitive markers (pS2
  and PR) in breast carcinoma cell lines were analyzed [53].
- When MCF-7 cells pretreated with PME were treated with estrogen, the c-Myc expression
  was not induced as much as when treated with estrogen alone, demonstrating the effect
  of PME in estrogen regulated mechanism (Figure 3).
- ER positive cells treated with PPT (4,4′,4′′-(4-Propyl-(1_H_)-pyrazole-1,3,5-triyl)_tris_phenol)
  (ER_α_ selective agonist) and DPN (Diarylpropionitrile) (ER_β_ selective agonist)
  clearly showed that PPT increased the pS2 protein levels, whereas DPN did not produce
  any significant effect.
- When given in combination with PPT, PME reduced the pS2 protein levels indicating
  the role of ER_α_ in mediating the effects of PME on pS2 expression (Figure 4).
- Thus the effect of PME on expression of pS2 was mediated by ER_α_ and not by ER_β_
  [53].
- 'Figure 3: Effect of PME pretreatment on E2 induced expression of c-Myc.'
- (a) MCF7 cells were pretreated with 100 nM E2 for 4 hrs, with or without PME pretreatment
  (80 _μ_g/mL) for 12 hrs and RT-PCR was done.
- (b) shows the ratio of density of c-Myc gene expression to that of endogenous control
  GAPDH and it represents mean ± SE of 3 replicates ( ).
- 'Figure 4: Effect of PME on pS2 protein expression in MCF7 cells.'
- (a) Immunoblot result of MCF7 cells treated with 10 nM E2, PME (80 _μ_g/mL), 10
  nM PPT, 10 nM DPN, and PME (80 _μ_g/mL) with 10 nM PPT or 10 nM DPN for 48 hrs.
- (b) Data are presented as densitometric ratio relative to nontreated control (CON)
  cells.
- The values are mean ± SE of 3 separate experiments ( ).
- Pomegranate fruit extract was revealed to inhibit UV-B-mediated phosphorylation
  of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor NF-_κ_B activation
  [55].
- Pomegranate juice almost downregulated the TNF_α_ induced Akt (protein kinase B)
  activation required for NF-_κ_B activity [56].
- Koyama et al.
- '[57] examined the effects of pomegranate extract (POMx) on the IGF system and found
  out cell growth inhibition and apoptosis.'
- Their findings suggested that POMx treatment reduced mTOR phosphorylation at Ser2448
  and Ser2481, whereas IGFBP-3 increased phosphorylation at those sites.
- These results suggested that POMx decreased prostate cancer cell survival by inhibiting
  IGF1 expression.
- To conclude, pomegranate fruit has anticancer properties that can be attributed
  to different mechanisms.
- _In vitro_,_ in vivo_ and human trials had examined the effects of a range of pomegranate
  constituents on the prevention and reduction of atherosclerosis and LDL oxidation
  [58].
- Evidence suggested that polyphenolic antioxidants contained in pomegranate juice
  can cause reduction of oxidative stress and atherogenesis through the activation
  of redox-sensitive genes ELK-1 and p-JUN and increased eNOS expression.
- Their results indicated that proatherogenic effects induced by disturbed shear stress
  can be reversed by constant administration of pomegranate juice [59].
- Pomegranate juice consumption for 3 years by patients with carotid artery stenosis
  reduced common blood pressure, LDL oxidation, and carotid intima-media thickness
  [60].
- Azadzoi et al.
- demonstrated that 8-week administration of pomegranate juice concentrate daily in
  a rabbit model of arteriogenic erectile dysfunction significantly increased intracavernous
  blood flow and smooth muscle relaxation, probably via its antioxidant effect on
  enhanced nitric oxide preservation and bioavailability [61].
- A pilot study in type 2 diabetic patients with hyperlipidemia found that concentrated
  pomegranate juice decreased cholesterol absorption, increased faecal excretion of
  cholesterol, had a favourable effect on enzymes concerned in cholesterol metabolism,
  drastically reduced LDL cholesterol, and improved LDL/HDL cholesterol and total/HDL
  ratios [62].
- Aviram et al.
- analyzed atherosclerotic lesion size, antioxidant activity, blood sugar, peritoneal
  macrophages, oxidative status, and lipid profiles for 3 months after giving 6 different
  pomegranate preparations with varying amounts of total polyphenols and gallic acid
  content in atherosclerotic apolipoprotein-E deficient mice and found that pomegranate
  phenolics and pomegranate unique complexed sugars could mimic the antiatherogenic
  effects of pomegranate extracts [63].
- All these evidences suggest the potential cardioprotective effect of pomegranate
  fruit.
- Tissue selective estrogen agonist/antagonists are currently being investigated as
  alternatives to estrogen in the prevention and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis
  [64–66].
- Bone loss after ovariectomy is associated with high bone turnover where bone resorption
  rate exceeds the bone formation rate [67].
- To assess the protective role of_ Punica_ on skeletal system, we had examined the
  effect of PME on a well-characterized osteoblastic cell population (osteoblastic
  MC3T3-E1 cells) and examined its effect on Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP), which is
  a commonly used bone remodelling marker.
- The results (Figure 5) indicated that PME significantly increased ALP activity,
  supporting its suggested role in modulating osteoblastic cell differentiation [68].
- 'Figure 5: PME increased ALP activity in MC3T3-E1 osteoblast without affecting cell
  proliferation.'
- (a) Dose-dependent effect of PME on cell proliferation.
- MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts were treated with 0 (control), 20, 40, 80, 160, and 320 _μ_g/mL
  of PME for 48 hrs and the cell proliferation was determined by MTT assay.
- The cell proliferation was expressed as percentage cell viability over the untreated
  control.
- (b) Cells were treated with E2 (10 nM), PME (40, 80, and 160 _μ_g/mL), ICI (1 _μ_M)
  with or without PME (80 _μ_g/mL) for 48 hrs.
- ALP activity was then measured and results are expressed as percentage over the
  untreated control.
- Results are expressed as mean values ± SE of five replicates.
- when compared to untreated control.
- Ovariectomized rodent model is a well-established system for estrogen deficiency
  induced bone loss and used by researchers previously [69, 70].
- We had evaluated the antiosteoporotic potential of the extract in estrogen deficiency
  induced osteoporosis in young adult mice of 6–8 weeks of age by assessing the bone
  turnover by serum ALP.
- In comparison to the sham surgery (SS) control, ovariectomized (Ovx) control animals
  showed an increase in ALP activity indicating an increase in bone turn-over rate
  in these animals.
- PME in higher concentration was found to be effective in decreasing this bone turnover,
  though E2 was better in controlling the accelerated bone turnover (Table 2).
- The experimental model differed from aged Ovx mice wherein the osteoporosis is induced
  only by estrogen deficiency and not by a combination of natural bone loss due to
  age and ovarian hormone deficiency.
- An increase in bone turn-over rate was indicated by higher serum ALP level in the
  Ovx group compared to the SS control group.
- Therefore, high rate of bone turnover was well corrected by PME suggesting that
  it might play a protective role against ovarian hormone insufficiency related bone
  resorption.
- But E2 as well as PME was able to significantly decrease ALP levels in Ovx mice
  (Table 2).
- Serum calcium and phosphorous levels in Ovx control, PME treated, and tamoxifen
  treated animals were similar to that of SS control animals.
- Significant decrease in calcium levels was observed in E2 treated animals in comparison
  to SS control (Table 2).
- Our findings clearly indicated that the possible bone preserving effect of PME is
  almost comparable with E2 [53].
- Earlier studies had shown that an acute or chronic exposure to xenoestrogens or
  dietary phytoestrogens alters uterine expression of estrogen sensitive genes in
  mice [71].
- So in order to check whether PME has any effect, a semiquantitative RT-PCR was done
  to analyze uterine mRNA levels of lactoferrin in ovariectomized mice fed with PME
  for 7 days.
- Lactoferrin is a well-known estrogen target gene and a biologically active molecule
  for bone regeneration [72].
- The positive control E2 increased the uterine accumulation of lactoferrin mRNA in
  Ovx animals compared to the vehicle treated Ovx control (Figure 6).
- Lactoferrin expression did not differ significantly between the groups that received
  PME (50, 100 mg/kg bwt) and the vehicle (0.1% ethanol) treated Ovx control group,
  indicating the lack of estrogenicity of PME on uterine endometrium in the doses
  tested in our study.
- Tamoxifen (10 mg/kg bwt) was found to increase the expression of lactoferrin, though
  not significantly [68].
- As there are promising results from both_ in vitro_ and_ in vivo_ studies, we suggest
  evaluating the antiosteoporotic potential by clinical trials with pomegranate fruit
  extract that has no side effects on uterine endometrium alongside a significant
  decrease in bone turn-over rate.
- 'Table 2: Effect of E2, PME, and tamoxifen on chosen markers of bone metabolism
  of ovariectomized mice.'
- Serum calcium, phosphorus, and Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP) levels of sham control
  (SS Con) and Ovx mice exposed to 0.1% ethanol (vehicle control), E2 (1 mg/kg bwt),
  PME (50, 100 mg/kg bwt), and tamoxifen (TAM, 10 mg/kg bwt) for 7 days (bwt = body
  weight).
- Data are expressed as mean ± SE ( ).
- 'Figure 6: PME did not alter lactoferrin expression in murine uterus.'
- (a) RT-PCR detection of Lactoferrin m-RNA in sham control (SS CON) and ovariectomized
  mice exposed to 0.1% ethanol (vehicle control, Ovx CON), E2 (1 mg/kg bwt), PME (50,
  100 mg/kg bwt), and tamoxifen (TAM, 10 mg/kg bwt) for 7 days.
- (b) shows the ratio of density of target gene expression to that of endogenous control
  beta-actin and it represents mean ± SE of three replicates.
- _In vitro _assay showed that fermented pomegranate juice extract is better than
  red wine and comparable to green tea [37].
- There were also reports that pomegranate juice possessed considerably greater antioxidant
  capacity at much lower concentrations (&gt;1000-fold dilutions) than either grape
  or blueberry juice [73]._ Punica granatum _peel extract decreased lipid peroxidation
  in hepatic, cardiac, and renal tissues and at the same time it had a facilitatory
  effect on the scavenging capability of superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide [74].
- Formerly, it was shown that pomegranate peel extract supplementation alleviated
  oxidative damage of the liver and enhanced the hepatic structure and function in
  rats exposed to bile duct ligation [75].
- Pretreatment of carbon tetrachloride-induced liver damage in rats with pomegranate
  peel extract resulted in the reduction of lipid peroxidation and at the same time,
  the free-radical scavenging activity of catalase, superoxide dismutase, and peroxidase
  were considerably enhanced [76].
- Many studies had keenly explored the anti-inflammatory properties of pomegranate
  fruit [15, 77–79].
- Studies indicated that pomegranate extract inhibited PMACI-induced proinflammatory
  cytokines assembly by inhibiting the gene expression.
- This is achieved by blocking JNK and ERK-MAPK activation and NF-_κ_B activation
  in human KU812 cells [80].
- Larrosa et al.
- showed that pomegranate extract supplementations led to reduced prostaglandin E2
  (PGE2) levels in the colon mucosa by downregulating the overexpressed COX-2 and
  prostaglandin E synthase (PTGES) levels owing to the action of ellagic acid [78]._
  Punica granatum _extract had been found to be particularly effective for controlling
  oral inflammation, dental plaque, and bacterial and fungal counts in periodontal
  disease and Candida-associated denture stomatitis [81, 82].
- Another study proposed that inhibition of number of signal transduction pathways
  and the downstream pathogenic cellular response by pomegranate extract or compounds
  may be a useful approach for the prevention of the onset and severity of inflammatory
  arthritis [77].
- The dynamism of pomegranate fruit in newer areas of pharmacological effects might
  be delivered in the future.
- Due to the possible adverse side effects of estrogenic stimulation (such as increase
  in tumor risk), many women have turned to phytoestrogens as an alternative for HRT
  [83].
- The features that facilitate the chemicals to bind with ER are the steric and hydrophobic
  properties of a compound, as well as the hydrogen bonding between the phenolic hydroxyl
  group and the ER binding site [84].
- Phytoestrogens bind to both forms of ER and showed a lower binding affinity than
  E2.
- Some of them exhibit a higher binding affinity to ER_β_ than to ER_α_ which may
  indicate that they have different pathways for their actions and explains tissue
  specific changeability in phytoestrogenic action [85].
- Both genomic and nongenomic mechanisms have been projected to explain phytoestrogenic
  effects on human health [86].
- The best move towards the avoidance and handling of estrogen-dependent breast cancer
  is to selectively hold estrogen activity in the affected tissues without compromising
  its beneficial effects [87].
- Regrettably, at this time, available antiestrogen such as tamoxifen used in the
  treatment of ER-positive breast cancer has side effects and agonism in the uterine
  endometrium, leading to an uncertain connection to endometrial carcinoma [88–90].
- A competitive radioactive binding study was done to ascertain whether PME interacts
  with ER and had shown that PME binds to ER and inhibited the binding of labelled
  estrogen to ER in a dose-dependent manner [53, 91].
- According to De Felice, who coined the term nutraceutical, it can be defined as,
  “a food (or part of a food) that provides medical or health benefits, including
  the prevention and/or treatment of a disease” [92].
- It may range from isolated nutrients, herbal products, dietary supplements, and
  diets to genetically engineered “designer” foods and processed products such as
  cereals, soups, and beverages [93, 94].
- Anthocyanidins (delphinidin, cyanidin, and pelargonidin) and hydrolysable tannins
  (such as punicalagin, pedunculagin, punicalin, gallagic, and ellagic acid esters
  of glucose), account for the major antioxidant activity of whole fruit [22, 95].
- The peel, which is also a major part of the fruit, is an imperative source of bioactive
  compounds such as phenolics, flavonoids, ellagitannins, proanthocyanidin compounds
  [96], minerals, [97], and complex polysaccharides [98].
- Aviram and others reported that systolic blood pressure was reduced, after 1 year
  of pomegranate juice consumption.
- This was believed to be related to the potent antioxidant properties of pomegranate
  polyphenols [60].
- Hong et al.
- confirmed that pomegranate juice and pomegranate extracts were more potent inhibitors
  of cell growth than isolated individual polyphenols in cell lines, influential synergistic
  and/or additive effects of several phytochemicals including proanthocyanidins, anthocyanins,
  and flavonoid glycosides [99].
- Pomegranate contains agents, particularly polyphenolic flavonoids, which exert actions
  that could be well conducive to good oral health, particularly in relation to gingivitis
  development [100].
- Pomegranate juice had the greatest antioxidant potency composite index among beverages
  like black cherry juice, cranberry juice, grape juice, apple juice, orange juice,
  red wines, blueberry juice, and iced tea; and the antioxidant activity was at least
  20% superior to any of the other beverages tested [101–103].
- Each and every part of pomegranate provides health benefits, that is, a nutraceutical
  food.
- The discovery that plants generate hormonally active phytochemicals has altered
  our understanding of the connection between diet and human health.
- It is well established that fruit or plant extracts are a complex mixture of various
  constituents and, in most of the instances, it is not clear whether a single compound
  or a mixture of compounds is responsible for the reported effects [104].
- The thought of the whole herb or multiherb preparation not only addresses multiple
  targets, but possibly will alleviate the toxicity and side effects of a single,
  isolated compound from the plant.
- Many_ in vitro_ and_ in vivo_ studies pointed out high nutritional and potential
  tissue specific action of extract of_ Punica granatum_.
- Proofs are accumulating that compounds present in a fruit or herb extract augment
  each other’s biological effect.
- For example, it has been reported that quercetin and ellagic acid (both are also
  present in pomegranate) together make use of a more prominent inhibitory effect
  against cancer cell growth than either compound alone [105].
- We had found that PME has antiestrogenic effect in the mammary gland, without compromising
  the beneficial effects of estrogen in the cardiovascular and skeletal system and
  had no estrogenicity in the uterus [53].
- PME could possibly be considered as an ideal SERM and further studies might demonstrate
  its suitability and possible application in estrogen dependent breast cancers with
  beneficial effects in other hormone dependent tissues.
- Figure 7 describes the biological effects of PME, as observed in our studies.
- Furthermore, it would be valuable to investigate the long-term effects of PME in
  the_ in vivo_ models of estrogen deprivation to demonstrate its suitability in HRT.
- To achieve this goal, a better understanding is needed regarding the orchestrated
  action of SERM, receptor and coregulators that contribute to distinct patterns of
  gene expression.
- Although scientific research is being carried out to study the biological activity
  of a lot of food phytochemicals, the health claims attributed to the final marketed
  nutraceutical products have normally little or doubtful scientific foundation.
- This is owing to the fact that a great deal of scientific conclusion is derived
  from animal testing and_ in vitro_ assays, while human clinical trials are limited.
- Some key issues such as metabolism, bioavailability, toxicity, and dose/response
  of these food bioactive compounds or nutraceuticals themselves have not been well
  recognized yet.
- Currently, numerous clinical trials are in progress exploring the therapeutic potential
  of pomegranate extracts.
- Its potential use as a nutraceutical needs to be investigated.
- We may thus anticipate that many of the open issues about the biological effect
  of extract of_ Punica granatum_ will be answered in the near future.
- 'Figure 7: Biological effects of PME.'
- PME was found to be antiestrogenic in breast, exhibited cardioprotective and osteoprotective
  effects, and had no estrogenicity in uterus.
- It did not induce DNA adduct formation or oxidative DNA damage and suppressed TNF
  _α_-mediated endothelial cell apoptosis.
