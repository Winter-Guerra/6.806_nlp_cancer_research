- Cisplatin is one of the mostly used antineoplastic drugs in the treatment of cancer,
  but its clastogenic potential has become of great interest.
- In patients treated with long-term cisplatin, genetic damage can be observed during
  chemotherapy or many years later.
- The aim of this study was to investigate the possible anticlastogenic effect of
  pretreatment with olive, extra virgin olive, canola or corn oils on cisplatin-induced
  chromosomal aberrations in Wistar rat bone marrow cells.
- The animals received pretreatment with a single dose of vegetable oils (5 ml/kg
  b.w.)
- by gavage before cisplatin i.p.
- (5 mg/kg b.w.
- ), and were sacrificed 24 h after cisplatin injection.
- The pretreatment with a single dose of olive, extra virgin olive and canola oils
  caused a statistically significant decrease in the total of chromosomal aberrations
  and abnormal metaphases induced by cisplatin when compared with the groups treated
  with cisplatin alone.
- The possible explanation for the anticlastogenic effects observed in the pretreatment
  with olive, extra virgin olive and canola oils is ascribed to the oil contents.
- In conclusion, from the findings we suggest that these oils have some antioxidant
  effect, and the anticlastogenesis mechanisms of these oils need to be explored further
  before their use during cisplatin chemotherapy.
