- Gastric cancer and breast cancer have a clear tendency toward metastasis and invasion
  to the microenvironment predominantly composed of adipocytes.
- Oleic acid is an abundant monounsaturated fatty acid that releases from adipocytes
  and impinges on different energy metabolism responses.
- The effect and underlying mechanisms of oleic acid on highly metastatic cancer cells
  are not completely understood.
- We reported that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) was obviously activated in
  highly aggressive carcinoma cell lines treated by oleic acid, including gastric
  carcinoma HGC-27 and breast carcinoma MDA-MB-231 cell lines.
- AMPK enhanced the rates of fatty acid oxidation and ATP production and thus significantly
  promoted cancer growth and migration under serum deprivation.
- Inactivation of AMPK attenuated these activities of oleic acid.
- Oleic acid inhibited cancer cell growth and survival in low metastatic carcinoma
  cells, such as gastric carcinoma SGC7901 and breast carcinoma MCF-7 cell lines.
- Pharmacological activation of AMPK rescued the cell viability by maintained ATP
  levels by increasing fatty acid β-oxidation.
- These results indicate that highly metastatic carcinoma cells could consume oleic
  acid to maintain malignancy in an AMPK-dependent manner.
- Our findings demonstrate the important contribution of fatty acid oxidation to cancer
  cell function.

- Epidemiological and animal studies have demonstrated an association between fatty
  acids (FA) or obesity and the cancer tumourigenesis and metastasis [1], [2].
- Advanced gastric cancer and breast cancer have a clear tendency towards metastasis
  and invasion to the microenvironment, which is predominantly composed of adipocytes
  [3], [4].
- Oleic acid is the most common monounsaturated FA in human adipocytes and other tissues
  [5]–[7].
- Relatively little is known regarding whether highly metastatic gastric and breast
  cancer cells could adapt to the highly fatty acid culture and gain a survival/growth
  advantage by metabolic transformation to utilise oleic acid as an energy source.
- Studies from recent decades have reported accumulating evidence of metabolic reorganisation
  during cancer development in various tumour types [8].
- One of the first biochemical hallmarks of cancer cells to be identified were the
  marked changes in metabolism [9].
- Tumour cells gain a survival/growth advantage by adapting their metabolism to respond
  to environmental stress, a process known as metabolic transformation.
- The best-known aspect of metabolic transformation is the Warburg effect [10].
- Recently, several lines of evidence implicate fatty acid oxidation (FAO) as an important
  contributor to metabolic transformation [11]–[15], indicating that fatty acid metabolism
  might contribute to cancer cell function.
- With most cancer researchers focusing on glycolysis, glutaminolysis and fatty acid
  synthesis, the relevance of fatty acid oxidation (FAO) to cancer cell function has
  not been carefully examined.
- In particular, little is known regarding the biochemical pathways by which oleic
  acid influences tumour progression.
- One of the fundamental requirements of all cells is the balancing of ATP consumption
  and generation [16].
- Tumour cells typically undergo metabolic transformation modulated by AMPK [17]–[20].
- AMPK is a highly conserved sensor of cellular energy status that exists in the form
  of heterotrimeric complexes containing a catalytic α-subunit combined with regulatory
  β and γ-subunits [21], [22].
- In response to energy depletion, AMPK activation promotes metabolic changes to maintain
  cell proliferation and survival by directly phosphorylating rate-limiting enzymes
  in metabolic pathways, modifying the signal transduction cascades and gene expression
  [23].
- FAO induction downstream from AMPK activation might be a survival or growth strategy
  employed by some cancer cells subjected to metabolic stress [20].
- It has been reported recently that omental adipocytes promote homing, migration
  and invasion of ovarian cancer cells [24].
- Adipocyte-ovarian cancer cell coculture led to the direct transfer of lipids from
  adipocytes to ovarian cancer cells and promoted tumour growth, suggesting that there
  is a link in cancer cells between the adaptation to consume exogenous energy and
  the ability to migrate.
- It is unknown whether oleic acid provides an energy source for other highly metastatic
  carcinoma cells; if so, there is a question regarding the basis of molecular mechanism.
- It is essential to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which oleic acid regulates
  the malignant behaviour of high metastatic cancer cells.
- To clarify the unknown problems, we based our work on the premise that assessing
  the influence and mechanism of oleic acid on cancer cells would provide a better
  understanding of fatty acid metabolism and the molecular mechanisms present in gastric
  and breast cancer cells.
- Fatty acid-free BSA was obtained from Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., and oleic
  acid, AICAR and Compound C were purchased from Sigma.

  foetal calf serum (FCS), and the HGC-27, AGS, SGC7901 and BGC823 cells were maintained
  in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FCS.
- The cells were grown in monolayer cultures at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of
  95% air and 5% CO2.
- When BSA-bound fatty acids were added to the serum-free culture medium, the final

  with 10-uM BrdU.
- The cells were incubated for 30 min with a diluted, peroxidase-conjugated anti-BrdU
  antibody.
- The absorbance values were measured at 450 nm using an ELISA reader (Bio-Rad iMark).

  BSA or 400 µM BSA-bound oleic acid and allowed to migrate from the upper compartment
  to the lower compartment toward a 15% FBS gradient for the indicated time period.
- After the migration, the non-migratory cells on the upper membrane surface were
  removed by scrubbing, and the membrane was fixed in buffered 4% paraformaldehyde
  and stained with 0.1% crystal violet at room temperature.
- The migrated cells were then enumerated.

- The cells were washed with PBS, and images were obtained under a light contrast
  microscope.
- The intracellular triglycerides were assayed using a triglyceride assay kit (GPO-POD;
  Applygen Technologies, Inc., Beijing, China) according to the manufacturer’s recommended
  protocol.
- Five million cells were resuspended in 1 ml of fresh warm medium pre-equilibrated
  with 21% oxygen and placed in a sealed respiration chamber equipped with a thermostat
  control, micro stirring device and Clark-type oxygen electrode disc (Oxytherm, Hansatech
  Instrument, Cambridge, UK).
- The oxygen content in the cell suspension medium was constantly monitored for 10
  min, and the oxygen consumption rate was recorded.
- The intracellular level of ATP was measured with an ATPlite assay kit (Beyotime
  Biotech).
- The cells were incubated in a serum-free medium with or without 400 µM of OA for
  48 h, washed with PBS three times, lysed in ATP extraction buffer and centrifuged
  in 4°C.
- ATP was measured by luminometric methods using commercially available luciferin/luciferase
  reagents on a luminometer (TD-20/20; Turner Designs) according to the manufacturer’s
  instructions.
- The data were normalised to total protein.
- The data are presented as the means ± SD.
- SPSS 13.0 software was used for the statistical evaluation using one-way ANOVA for
  comparison of more than two groups, and LSD-t test, Dunnett’s T3 or Tamhane’s T2
  were used for the multiple comparisons.
- Student’s t test was used for the comparison of the two groups.
- P values of less than 0.05 were considered significant.
- To better clarify the role of oleic acid in tumour growth, we examined the effects
  of oleic acid on the cell viability of human gastric carcinoma cell lines and breast
  cancer cell lines, respectively.
- As shown in Fig.
- 1A, 400 µM of BSA-bound oleic acid stimulated obvious cell viability in HGC-27 cells
  after 24, 48, and 72 hours of exposure.
- A decrease in cell viability was observed in the AGS, SGC7901 and BGC823 cells treated
  with OA.
- In the MDA-MB-231 cells, OA had an effect on cell viability similar to that of the
  HGC-27 cells, more profoundly with the 72-hours treatment.
- We observed an inhibitory effect of OA on cell viability in the MCF-7 cells (Fig.
- 1B).
- Figure 1.
- Effects of oleic acid on cell survival in various human cancer cell lines.
- Human gastric cancer cell lines (A) and breast cancer cell lines (B) were starved
  for 12 hours and then incubated with 0.5% BSA as the control or 400 µM BSA-bound
  oleic acid for the indicated time period (hours).
- The cell viability was determined by an MTT assay and expressed as a percentage
  of the control cells.
- The values are the mean ± SD, n = 3; p&lt;0.01 vs. BSA at the indicated time points.
- Student’s t test.
- (C) The cells were incubated with 0.5% BSA or 400-µM BSA-bound oleic acid for the
  indicated time points, and the cell proliferation was examined using BrdU ELISA.
- The values are the mean ± SD, n = 3; p&lt;0.05 and p&lt;0.01 for OA compared with
  BSA.Student’s t test.
- For a better assessment of the reason for the cell viability change induced by OA,
  we first determined the cell proliferation using BrdU ELISA.
- The assessment shows that cell proliferation was significantly higher in the OA
  groups compared with the control group in the HGC-27 and MDA-MB-231 cells; OA exhibited
  a slight inhibition of cell proliferation in the SGC7901 and MCF-7 cells (Fig.
- 1C).
- The Hoechst staining and flow cytometry analysis indicated that OA afforded protection
  against apoptosis in the HGC-27 and MDA-MB-231 cells whereas it induced apoptosis
  in the SGC7901 cells and MCF-7 cells.
- Mechanically, the level of cleaved caspase3 and cleaved caspase9 were changed in
  the OA-treated cells compared to that in the control group, suggesting that mitochondrial
  apoptotic pathway might be involved in this progress (Figure S1).
- To further determine the action of OA on cell migration, we used Transwell chamber
  assays to gauge the migratory ability of the cells treated with OA.
- The cells were plated into the insert in a serum-free medium containing BSA or 400
  µM of BSA-bound oleic acid and allowed to migrate from the upper compartment to
  the lower compartment toward a 15% FBS gradient.
- OA prompted an obvious increase in the migration of the HGC-27 and MDA-MB-231 cells,
  whereas this process was reduced in the SGC7901 cells (Figure 2).
- Figure 2.
- Effects of oleic acid on cell migration of gastric carcinoma cells and breast cancer
  cells.
- Cells treated with 0.5% BSA or 400 µM BSA-bound oleic acid were allowed to migrate
  from upper compartment to lower compartment toward a 15% FBS gradient for 12 hours
  in HGC-27 and SGC7901 cells and 6 hours in MDA-MB-231 cells.
- '(A) After then the migrated cells were fixed, stained, and photographed (magnification
  100 x) and (B) the migrated cells were then enumerated and normalised to the control,
  #p&lt;0.05 for OA compared with BSA.Student’s t test.'
- Exogenous OA transported into the cells is converted into acyl-CoA, which is esterified
  with glycerol to yield inert triacylglycerols (TGs) or β-oxidation [25], [26].
- Based on these findings, we hypothesised that the disparity in the cellular biological
  function treated by OA between the high metastatic cancer cells (HGC-27, and MDA-MB-231)
  and low metastatic cancer cells (SGC7901, MCF-7) is ascribed to the difference in
  the ability of intracellular TG lipolysis.
- We detected the expression of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), which catalyses
  the initial step of lipolysis, converting TGs to diacylglycerols (DGs).
- ATGL was completely stimulated in all the cells treated by OA compared to the control
  cells (Fig.
- 3A), demonstrating that lipolysis was not the distinction separating the high metastatic
  cancer cells from the low metastatic cancer cells.
- Figure 3.
- The AMPK pathway was selectively activated in various human cancer cells treated
  with oleic acid.
- (A) The cells were incubated with 0.5% BSA or 400 µM of BSA-bound oleic acid for
  48 hours.
- The levels of phosphorylated AMPK (Thr172), the total AMPK, pACC (Ser79), the total
  ACC, CPT1α and ATGL were determined by western blot analysis using 50 µg of the
  total proteins from each sample.
- (B) The Quantification of Protein expression by densitometry from three independent
  experiments normalised to GAPDH.
- The values are expressed as the percent of control cells, given as the mean ± SD,
  n = 3; p&lt;0.01 for OA compared with BSA.Student’s t test.
- AMPK, a fuel sensor, plays an important role in regulating fatty acid β-oxidation
  and is involved in the different effects OA has on cell function.
- We performed a comprehensive analysis of the expression of AMPK and a downstream
  gene by western blotting in various cancer cells.
- Phosphorylation of AMPKα was selectively up regulated by OA in the HGC-27 and MDA-MB-231
  cells, and there was no obvious change in the SGC7901 and MCF-7 cells (Fig.
- 3A &amp; B).
- Carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1(CPT1α), which catalyses the transport of long-chain
  fatty acids (LCFAs) into mitochondria for β-oxidation, is highly inhibited by the
  malonyl CoA that is catalysed in mitochondria by acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC).
- AMPK could phosphorylate and inactivate ACC, thus the ACC-dependent malonyl CoA
  levels fall, releasing the inhibition of CPT1α, which facilitates the mitochondrial
  entry of the LCFAs for β-oxidation [21], [27].
- As shown in Fig.
- 3A, OA significantly increased the phosphorylation of ACC in the HGC-27 cells and
  mildly affected the ACC in the MDA-MB-231 cells.
- The expression of CPT1α was up regulated consistently by OA in those two cell lines
  (Fig.
- 3A &amp; B).
- Consistently, the oxygen consumption rate of the MDA-MB-231 cells in the medium
  containing OA was significantly higher compared to that of the cells grown in the
  control medium.
- The oxygen consumption rate of the MCF-7 cells grown in the medium containing OA
  did not differ significantly from that of the control cells (Figure S2).
- These results suggested that AMPK activation participated in the utilisation of
  OA through β-oxidation and maintained a metabolic advantage.
- To further confirm that AMPK activation was involved in the utilisation of OA for
  growth, survival and migration in the cancer cell lines, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-D-rib​ofuranoside(AICAR)
  and Compound C were used.
- As shown in Figure 4A, the addition of Compound C to the HGC-27 and MDA-MB-231 cells
  suppressed the facilitation of growth by OA.
- The treatment with AICAR restrained the growth inhibition by OA in the SGC7901 and
  MCF-7 cells.
- Figure 4.
- AMPK activation facilitates cancer cell growth and survival in the presence of oleic
  acid.
- (A) The cells were cultured with 0.5% BSA or 400 µM of BSA-bound oleic acid with
  5 µM of Compound C or with 100 µM of AICAR for 24, 48, of 72 hours.
- The cell viability was determined using a MTT assayat the indicated time points.
- The values are the mean ± SD, n = 3; p&lt;0.05 and p&lt;0.01 for OA+Compound C or
  OA+AICAR compared with OA.one-way ANOVA followed by Fisher’s LSD test.
- (B) The cells transfected with control-siRNA or AMPKα1-siRNA were treated with 0.5%
  BSA or 400 µM of BSA-bound oleic acid for 24, 48, 72, of 96 hours.
- The cell viability was determined using an MTT assay and expressed as the percentage
  of the control cells at the indicated time points.
- The values are the mean ± SD, n = 3; p&lt;0.05 for OA+ AMPKα1-siRNA compared with
  OA+control-siRNA.one-way ANOVA followed by Fisher’s LSD test.
- (C) The cells were cultured with 0.5% BSA or 400 µM of BSA-bound oleic acid with
  5 µM of Compound C or with 100 µM of AICAR for 48 or 72 hours.
- The cell proliferation was examined using BrdU ELISA at the indicated time points.
- 'The values are the mean ± SD, n = 3; # p&lt;0.05 for OA+Compound C or OA+AICAR
  compared with OA.'
- one-way ANOVA followed by LSD test.
- (D) The statistical comparison of the percentage of the control cells in the cell-migration
  ability (the cells treated with 0.5% BSA or 400 µM of BSA-bound oleic acid with
  5 µM of Compound C or with 100 µM of AICAR were allowed to migrate for 12 hours
  in the HGC-27 and SGC7901 cells and for 6 hours in the MDA-MB-231 cells.).
- 'All of the statistical analysis values represent the mean of three experiments
  (the means ± SD, n = 3, p&lt;0.05 and p&lt;0.01 for OA compared with BSA; #p&lt;0.05
  and ##p&lt;0.01 for OA+Compound C or OA+AICAR compared with OA.'
- one-way ANOVA followed by LSD test.
- We designed siRNA specific to the AMPK catalytic α1-subunit to reduce the protein
  levels because AMPK is activated by phosphorylation of Thr172 on the catalytic α-subunit.
- The western blot assay confirmed an obvious reduction in the protein level in the
  MAD-MB-231 cells (Figure S3).
- As depicted in Figure 4B, consistent with the exposure to Compound C, silencing
  of the AMPK catalytic α-subunit by treatment with OA caused a reduction of cell
  viability after 72 hours.
- There was a question regarding whether the alteration of cell proliferation and
  migration relied on AMPK activation in the cells treated by OA.
- As shown in Figures 4 C&amp;D, Compound C elicited a 1.0 to 1.5-fold decrease in
  cell proliferation and migration in the OA-treated HGC-27 and MAD-MB-231 cells,
  whereas the reduction of cell proliferation and migration in the OA-treated SGC7901
  and MCF-7 cells was compensated for by AICAR.
- Collectively, these data suggested that AMPK activation is critical for the cancer
  cell survival and growth induced by OA.
- We assessed whether AMPK has a function in regulating the lipid accumulation induced
  by OA.
- Consistent with other observations [28], the lipid droplet material stained by Oil
  red O increased in the OA-treated MDA-MB-231 (Fig.
- 5A), HGC-27 and SGC7901 cells compared to the control cells (Figure S4), suggesting
  that cancer cells are able to esterify oleate for storage as TG.
- The lipid droplets in the OA-treated MDA-MB-231 cells were diffused with small granules,
  indicating that the TG stored in lipid droplets was simultaneously hydrolysed and
  provided with energy.
- Consistent with the Oil red O staining, the cellular triglyceride content assay
  indicated that OA induced TG accumulation significantly for the initial 6 hours,
  which was consumed during the next 30 hours in incubation with fresh medium in the
  absence of OA (OA+Con).
- Compound C attenuated the TG consumption compared to the control group (OA+Con),
  as shown in Figure 5B.
- This finding demonstrated that the inhibition of AMPK signalling impeded the utilisation
  of OA and fatty acid metabolism in an obvious manner.
- Figure 5.
- AMPK is pivotal to utilise OA and provide ATP for cancer cell growth and survival.
- (A) The MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured with 0.5% BSA or 400 µM of BSA-bound oleic
  acid with 5 µM of Compound C or with 100 µM of AICAR for 48 h. The cells were stained
  with Oil red O with 400× magnification.
- (B-D) The MDA-MB-231 cells were pretreated with 400 µM of oleic acid for 6 h and
  refreshed with medium containing 5 µM of Compound C or with 100 µM of AICAR for
  another 30 h. (B) The cells were digested, and the intracellular triglycerides were
  assayed using a triglyceride assay kit, normalised to the protein content.The data
  are presented as the mean ± SD, n = 3, p&lt;0.05, p&lt;0.01.
- (C) The oxygen content in the cell suspension medium was constantly monitored for
  10 min in the different groups.
- (D) The oxygen consumption was normalised against the number of viable cells being
  measured.
- The data are presented as the mean ± SD, n = 3, p&lt;0.05, p&lt;0.01.
- (E) Various cancer cells were cultured with 0.5% BSA or 400 µM of BSA-bound oleic
  acid with 5 µM of Compound C or with 100 µM of AICAR for 48 h. The ATP level was
  determined with a commercial assay and normalised to the protein content.
- 'The data are presented as the mean ± SD, n = 3, p&lt;0.05 for OA compared with
  BSA; #p&lt;0.05 for OA+Compound C or OA+AICAR compared with OA.'
- Multiple groups were compared using one-way ANOVA followed by Fisher’s LSD test.
- To further elucidate the mitochondrial respiratory chain activity, we measured the
  oxygen consumption rate in the cells with different treatments.
- This result indicated that OA stimulated the oxygen consumption whereas Compound
  C reduced the oxygen consumption in the MDA-MB-231 cells, suggesting that AMPK might
  participate in the intracellular fatty acids flux into mitochondria for β-oxidation
  (Fig.
- 5 C&amp;D).
- We determined whether AMPK activation is directly attributable to the ATP production
  influenced by the OA stress in our cell models.
- The intracellular levels of ATP in the various treated groups of different cell
  lines were measured (Fig.
- 5E).
- As shown in figure 5E, the inhibition of the AMPK signalling by Compound C attenuated
  the increase of ATP production in the HGC-27 and MDA-MB-231 cells treated with OA,
  whereas the AICAR compensated for the ATP level by activating the AMPK signalling
  in the SGC7901 and MCF-7 cells.
- These data support our hypothesis that the activation state of AMPK is a switch
  in the cells to respond to OA by mediating fatty acid metabolism.
- To understand the accurate molecular mechanism by which AMPK activation determined
  the effects of OA on cellular function, we examined the status of AMPK activation
  and the expression of related enzymes regarding the FFA metabolism.
- It was parallel to the data shown in Figure 3 and demonstrated that OA activated
  the AMPK signalling by up-regulating the phosphorylation of AMPKα and ACC.
- This up regulation is accompanied by an increase in the expression of CPT1α, whereas
  this induction was obviously attenuated by Compound C in the HGC-27 and MDA-MB-231
  cells.
- Apparently, AMPK was not stimulated in the MCF-7 or SGC7901 cells in the presence
  of OA.
- When AICAR was added to the medium, the level of the phosphorylated AMPKα and ACCwas
  increased, as well as the CPT1α and MCAD levels, which catalysed crucial steps in
  the mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation (Fig.
- 6A).
- To confirm further the implication of the AMPK signalling in the OA action, we transfected
  the AMPKα1-siRNA in the HGC-27 and MAD-MB-231 cells, and then treated the cells
  with OA or BSA, as the control.
- As shown in Figure 6B, silencing the AMPKα caused a reduction in the expression
  of phosphorylated AMPKα and ACC with CPT1α and MCAD.
- Figure 6.
- AMPK is involved in the OA-mediated protein expressions of fatty acid metabolism
  enzymes.
- The gastric carcinoma cells and breast cancer cells were cultured with 0.5% BSA
  or 400 µM of BSA-bound oleic acid with 5 µM of Compound C or with 100 µM of AICAR
  for 48 h. The levels of pAMPKα (Thr172), the total AMPKα, pACC (Ser79), the total
  ACC, CPT1α, MCAD and ATGL were determined by western blot analysis using 50 µg of
  the total proteins from each sample.
- A representative blot is shown.
- (B) The cells transfected with control-siRNA or AMPKα1-siRNA (24 hours) were treated
  with 0.5% BSA or 400 µM of BSA-bound oleic acid for another 48 hours.
- The expressions of pAMPKα (Thr172), the total AMPKα, pACC (Ser79), the total ACC,
  CPT1α, MCAD and ATGL were determined by western blot analysis.
- Although the expression of ATGL was completely stimulated in all the cells treated
  by OA compared to the control cells (Fig.
- 3A), it was not influenced by the AMPK status (Fig.
- 6A, 6B), suggesting that ATGL, at least at the protein level, was not regulated
  by AMPK in the conditions of the OA treatment.
- These data suggested that AMPK is critical for OA stimulation of cancer cell survival
  and growth through the promotion of fatty acid oxidation.
- The data presented in this study demonstrated that oleic acid selectively promotes
  cell proliferation and migration in high metastatic cancer cells whereas it has
  inhibitory effects in low metastatic cancer cells.
- Although for decades it has been well accepted that AMPK activation suppresses cell
  growth and proliferation [29], [30], new evidence that AMPK activation promotes
  certain human cancer cell growth and survival emerged recently in such as prostate
  and ovarian cancer and in glioma cells [23], [30], [31].
- Our data reinforced this new concept with additional information elucidated the
  unique characteristics of energy metabolism in high metastatic cancer cells encountering
  metabolic stress from oleic acid exposure, which was mediated by AMPK activation
  that resulted in enhanced fatty acid oxidation.
- The physiological roles of oleic acid in health and disease in humans are minimally
  investigated and understood.
- High-metastatic cancer cells and low metastatic cancer cells had opposite responses
  to oleic acid treatment with respect to cell survival and migration.
- As shown, the HGC-27 and MDA-MB-231 cells grew faster in the presence of oleic acid
  (Fig.
- 1&amp;2).
- There is increasing evidence that cancer cells show specific alterations in different
  aspects of lipid metabolism.
- The changes in lipid metabolism affect numerous cellular processes, including cell
  growth, proliferation and motility [32].
- Metabolically, the high metastastic cancer cells setting from low metastastic cancer
  cells are endowed with rapid growth and high migration ability, which are because
  of the distinct metabolism trait.
- We concluded that high metastatic cancer cells with high-level consumption for energy
  utilise OA more efficiently than their counterpart cells.
- The molecular differences induced by OA in these two cell groups are unclear.
- AMPK is a key regulator of energy homeostasis within cells.
- On activation, AMPK switches off the ATP-consuming biosynthetic pathways (e.g.,
  fatty acid synthesis) and activates the ATP-generating metabolic pathways (e.g.,
  fatty acid oxidation) to preserve the ATP levels for cell survival [33].
- This study was the first to unmask AMPK activation as a possible mechanism for the
  intrinsic correlation between OA and different cell fates.
- Mechanically, we found increased AMPK activation, based on Thr172 phosphorylation,
  in the high metastatic cancer cells exposed to OA, which exhibited the promotion
  of cell proliferation and migration.
- As shown, the total and phosphorylated AMPKα and ACC amounts as well as CPT1α were
  remarkably high in the HGC-27 and MDA-MB-231 cells, although the ATGL level was
  up-regulated in these two cell groups (Fig.
- 3).
- The role of fatty acid oxidation in the altered energy metabolism of cancer cells
  is less clear and might have been influenced by the culture conditions to which
  the cells were exposed.
- Our data suggested that β-oxidation rather than lipolysis is the main change in
  the microenvironment with OA; the data support a possible functional link between
  AMPK and the altered energy metabolism in cancer cells.
- The selective AMPK activation in high metastatic cancer cells results in energy
  metabolism plasticity or adaptation.
- This assumption was further sustained by the data obtained by inhibition or stimulation
  of AMPK activity.
- As shown in Figure 4, in the HGC-27 and MDA-MB-231 cells with AMPK activation induced
  by OA, the inhibition of AMPK by Compound C or AMPKα1 siRNA attenuated the increase
  of cell growth and migration, and the artificial activation of AMPK by AICAR in
  the SGC7901 and MCF7 cells compensated these inhibitory effects induced by OA.
- AMPK contributes to the maintenance of high ATP levels, which might remain remarkably
  stable for high energy-dependent molecular activities.
- Consistently, we found elevated levels of cellular ATP with AMPK activation and
  reduced ATP levels with inhibition of AMPK by Compound C in the OA-treated HGC-27
  and MDA-MB-231 cells, whereas AIACR activated AMPK, subsequently leading to the
  ATP production in the SGC7901 and MCF7 cells (Fig.
- 5E).
- The significant increase in oxygen consumption induced by oleic acid could be reduced
  by AMPK inhibition (Fig.
- 5C&amp;D).
- ATP production apparently results from the activation of AMPK and downstream enzymes.
- To support this mechanism, the study interpreted the intrinsic link between AMPK
  activation and the cellular behaviours.
- As shown in Figure 6, Compound C or AMPKα1 siRNA reduced the total and phosphorylated
  AMPKα and ACC as well as the subsequent CPT1α and MCAD levels, and AIACR compensated
  for these corresponding changes.
- One possible explanation for the difference between high and low malignancy cells
  would be the inability of the low malignancy cells to increase AMPKα and ACC gene
  expression in response to OA.Thus, it is possible that the long-term effects promoted
  by the constitutive AMPK activation support the adaptation of metastatic cells to
  the energy pathways that are predominant in specific metabolic stress and that contribute
  to the growth advantage of tumour cells.
- The two AMPKα variants (AMPK-α1 and AMPK-α2) have a differential localisation pattern
  in mammalian cells, with the AMPK-α1 subunit being localised in the cytoplasm whereas
  the AMPK-α2 subunit is localised in the nucleus [34].
- The transfection of cells with AMPK-α1 siRNA, and not AMPK-α2siRNA, abolished the
  effects of OA on the cell viability and protein expressions of phosphorylated ACC,
  CPT1α and MCAD.
- The downstream genes of AMPK, including ACC, that are localised in the cytoplasm
  suggest that at least some of the effects that were observed in the study are primarily
  because of the alpha-1 activity.
- The AMPK system is activated by a large variety of cellular stresses that deplete
  ATP, such as glucose deprivation, ischemia, hypoxia, oxidative stress and hyperosmotic
  stress.It has been demonstrated in cultured adipocytes that agents that increase
  intracellular cAMP increase the activity of AMPK [35].
- Wu has reported that treatment of bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs) with OA-NO2
  induced a significant increase in AMPKThr172 phosphorylation and AMPK activity [36].
- Recent reports have shown that oncogenic Ras, MYC and _Pten_ deletion activates
  AMPK and that this activation stimulates cell proliferation [31], [37].
- We hypothesise that the intracellular stresses or the oncogene induced by OA treatment
  in high metastatic cancer cells contribute to the activation of AMPK.
- The accurate mechanisms involved inthe regulation of AMPK in response to OA warrant
  further investigation.
- Oleic acid prompted cell proliferation and migration in high metastatic cancer cells
  via enhanced β-oxidation mediated by AMPK activation.
- Provided that these observations might be extended to the in vivo situation, it
  could be postulated that a microenvironment rich in oleic acid might favour tumour
  progression.
- We reported for the first time that activated AMPK is involved in OA-induced cell
  proliferation and migration in terms of energy metabolism, which offers novel potential
  targets for the chemoprevention of human cancer.
