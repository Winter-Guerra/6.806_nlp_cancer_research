- Piperine is a bioactive component of black pepper, _Piper nigrum_ Linn, commonly
  used for daily consumption and in traditional medicine.
- Here, the molecular mechanisms by which piperine exerts antitumor effects in HER2-overexpressing
  breast cancer cells was investigated.
- The results showed that piperine strongly inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis
  through caspase-3 activation and PARP cleavage.
- Furthermore, piperine inhibited _HER2_ gene expression at the transcriptional level.
- Blockade of ERK1/2 signaling by piperine significantly reduced SREBP-1 and FAS expression.
- Piperine strongly suppressed EGF-induced MMP-9 expression through inhibition of
  AP-1 and NF-ÎºB activation by interfering with ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, and Akt signaling
  pathways resulting in a reduction in migration.
- Finally, piperine pretreatment enhanced sensitization to paclitaxel killing in HER2-overexpressing
  breast cancer cells.
- Our findings suggest that piperine may be a potential agent for the prevention and
  treatment of human breast cancer with HER2 overexpression.
