- As suggested by rodent studies and studies using human breast cancer cells, dietary
  canola oil is linked with lower breast cancer risk.
- Here, we investigated the effect of maternal (pregnancy plus lactation) dietary
  canola oil on the susceptibility of female Sprague-Dawley rat offspring to mammary
  carcinogenesis.
- Although the control diet had 10% soybean oil, the treatment diet was formulated
  to contain 10% canola oil as a fat source.
- _N_-nitroso-_N_-methylurea was injected to induce mammary cancer in offspring.
- The offspring of canola-fed dams showed significantly decreased tumor multiplicity
  (1.0 ± 0.3 vs. 1.9 ± 0.3, respectively; _P_ = 0.04) and tumor volume (1232.5 ± 771.0
  mm3 vs. 6,302.5 ± 1,747.4 mm3, respectively; _P =_ 0.01), along with increased survival
  rate (87% vs. 47%, respectively; _P_ = 0.01).
- In addition, the mRNA expression of development-related gamma-glutamyltransferase
  1 was significantly higher in the lactating mammary tissues of the canola group
  dams and mammary tumor tissues of the offspring [2.5 ± 0.6 vs. 0.5 ± 0.2, respectively
  (_P_ = 0.01) and 0.98 ± 0.03 vs. 0.56 ± 0.15, respectively (_P_ = 0.05)].
- These results suggest a potential anticancer effect of maternal dietary canola oil
  and may be useful in devising prenatal nutritional strategies to reduce breast cancer
  risk in humans.
