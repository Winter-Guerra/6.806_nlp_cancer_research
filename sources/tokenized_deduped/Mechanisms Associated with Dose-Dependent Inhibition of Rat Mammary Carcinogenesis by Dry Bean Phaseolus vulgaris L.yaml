- The purpose of this study was to determine whether a dry bean (_Phaseolus vulgaris,_
  L.) containing diet exerts an inhibitory effect on mammary carcinogenesis in a well-characterized
  rodent model for breast cancer.
- Twenty-one-d-old female Sprague Dawley rats were given an intraperitoneal injection
  of 1-methyl-1-nitrosourea and 7 d after carcinogen injection were randomized to
  1 of 5 groups fed a modification of the AIN-93G diet formulation containing 0, 7.5,
  15, 30, or 60% (wt:wt) small red dry bean incorporated as cooked, freeze-dried,
  and milled powder.
- All experimental diets had the same macronutrient content based on proximate analysis.
- Compared with the control group, dry bean consumption resulted in dose-dependent
  reductions in mammary cancer incidence (_P_ = 0.046), cancer multiplicity (_P_ =
  0.001), and tumor burden (_P_ = 0.01).
- Dry bean consumption was associated with dose-dependent reductions in plasma concentrations
  of glucose, insulin, insulin-like growth factor-1, C-reactive protein, and interleukin-6
  in food-deprived rats.
- Analysis of mammary adenocarcinomas indicated that a dominant mechanism accounting
  for reduced tumor burden was the induction of apoptosis.
- B cell lymphoma 2 and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein levels decreased and
  BCL-2â€“associated X protein increased with increasing dry bean consumption, findings
  consistent with the induction of apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway.
- These data demonstrate that a legume without noteworthy content of isoflavones inhibits
  the development of mammary carcinogenesis and are consistent with a recent report
  from the Nurses Health Study that bean or lentil intake is associated with a lower
  risk for breast cancer.
