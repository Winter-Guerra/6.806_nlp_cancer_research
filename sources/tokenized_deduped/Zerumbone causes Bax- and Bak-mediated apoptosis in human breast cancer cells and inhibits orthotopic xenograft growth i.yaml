- The present study was undertaken to determine the anticancer efficacy of zerumbone
  (ZER), a sesquiterpene from subtropical ginger, against human breast cancer cells
  in vitro and in vivo.
- ZER treatment caused a dose-dependent decrease in viability of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231
  human breast cancer cells in association with G2/M phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis
  induction.
- ZER-mediated cell cycle arrest was associated with downregulation of cyclin B1,
  cyclin-dependent kinase 1, Cdc25C, and Cdc25B.
- Even though ZER treatment caused stabilization of p53 and induction of PUMA, these
  proteins were dispensable for ZER-induced cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis.
- Exposure of MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells to ZER resulted in downregulation of Bcl-2
  but its ectopic expression failed to confer protection against ZER-induced apoptosis.
- On the other hand, the SV40 immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts derived from
  Bax and Bak double knockout mice were significantly more resistant to ZER-induced
  apoptosis.
- ZER-treated MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells exhibited a robust activation of both Bax
  and Bak.
- In vivo growth of orthotopic MDA-MB-231 xenografts was significantly retarded by
  ZER administration in association with apoptosis induction and suppression of cell
  proliferation (Ki-67 expression).
- These results indicate that ZER causes G2/M phase cell cycle arrest and Bax/Bak-mediated
  apoptosis in human breast cancer cells, and retards growth of MDA-MB-231 xenografts
  in vivo.
- Breast cancer is a major health problem for women worldwide [1] necessitating identification
  of novel anticancer strategies.
- Merit of this objective is further enforced as many of the known risk factors associated
  with breast cancer are not easily modifiable (e.g., genetic predisposition) [2,
  3].
- Dietary compounds owing to their safety have drawn considerable attention in recent
  years for the discovery of novel cancer preventive and therapeutic agents [4].
- Bioactive compounds with preventive efficacy against cancer in preclinical rodent
  models have now been identified from many edible vegetables, including cruciferous
  vegetables (e.g., watercress and broccoli) and garlic [4–8].
- Moreover, population-based case–control studies continue to support the notion that
  dietary intake of certain fruits and vegetables may reduce the risk of cancer [9–11].
- Zerumbone (2,6,9,9-tetramethylcycloundeca-2,6,10-trien-1-one; hereafter abbreviated
  as ZER), a monocyclic sesquiterpene derived from tropical ginger _Zingiber zerumbet_,
  is one such phytochemical with preventive efficacy in preclinical rodent models
  of cancer and pancreatitis [12–17].
- For example, dietary administration of ZER for 5 weeks caused reduction in the frequency
  of aberrant crypt foci in association with suppression of cyclooxygenase-2 [12].
- Oral feeding of ZER inhibited dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis in female ICR
  mice [13].
- ZER treatment was also reported to suppress skin tumor initiation and promotion
  in ICR mice [14].
- ZER administration caused regression of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia in female
  Balb/c mice prenatally exposed to diethylstilboestrol [18].
- Diethylnitrosamine-initiated and 2-acetylaminofluorene-promoted liver carcinogenesis
  was inhibited by treatment with ZER [19].
- Cell culture models have also been used to study anticancer effects of ZER [20–26].
- For example, ZER inhibited proliferation of human colonic adenocarcinoma cell lines
  in association with dysfunction of mitochondria transmembrane leading to apoptotic
  cell death [20].
- Cytotoxic effect of ZER on leukemia cells was found to be mediated through cell
  cycle arrest and Fas- and mitochondria-mediated apoptosis [21].
- In liver cancer HepG2 cells, ZER-induced apoptosis was shown to be independent of
  p53 but associated with modulation of Bax/Bcl-2 ratio [22].
- Despite these advances, however, the mechanisms underlying growth inhibitory and
  proapoptotic effect of ZER are not fully understood.
- In the present study, we have addressed this mechanistic gap using MDA-MB-231 (an
  estrogen-independent cell line with mutant p53) and MCF-7 (an estrogen responsive
  cell line with wild-type p53) human breast cancer cells as a model.

  (Manassas, VA) and maintained, as described by us previously [28].
- Wild-type HCT-116 cell line and its isogenic PUMA knockout (KO) variant were generously
  provided by Dr. Bert Vogelstein (Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD) and cultured
  in McCoy’s 5A modified medium supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum and antibiotics.
- Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) derived from wild-type (WT) and Bax and Bak double
  knockout (DKO) mice and immortalized by transfection with a plasmid containing SV40
  genomic DNA were generously provided by the late Dr. Stanley J. Korsmeyer (Dana-Farber
  Cancer Institute, Boston, MA) and maintained, as described previously [29].
- Stock solution of ZER was prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and diluted with
  complete media before use.
- An equal volume of DMSO (final concentration 0.1 %) was added to controls.
- Effect of ZER treatment on cell survival was determined by trypan blue dye exclusion
  assay, as described by us previously [30] or cell proliferation assay using a Cell
  Proliferation Assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
- Effect of ZER treatment on cell cycle distribution was determined by flow cytometry
  after staining the cells with PI, as described by us previously [31].
- Control and ZER-treated cells were processed for immunoblotting, as described by
  us previously [28–32].
- Densitometric quantitation was done using UN-SCAN-IT software version 5.1 (Silk
  Scientific Corporation, Orem, UT).
- Apoptosis induction was assessed by quantitation of histone-associated DNA fragment
  release into the cytosol using an ELISA kit from Roche Applied Sciences (Indianapolis,
  IN) or flow cytometry using Annexin V-FITC/PI Apoptosis Detection kit.
- MCF-7 (1.5 × 105) cells were seeded in six-well plates and transfected at ~50 %
  confluency with 100 nM of p53-targeted siRNA or control siRNA using oligofectamine.
- Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were treated with DMSO (control)
  or ZER (20 μM) for 24 h. Cells were collected and processed for western blotting
  and determination of cell cycle distribution.
- MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells were transiently transfected at ~50–60 % confluency with
  the empty pSFFV-neo vector or pSFFV vector encoding for Bcl-2 using FuGENE6 transfection
  reagent.
- Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were treated with DMSO or ZER and
  processed for immunoblotting and measurement of apoptosis and cell viability.
- Effect of ZER on mitochondrial membrane potential was measured using potential-sensitive
  dye JC-1 (5,5′,6,6′-tetrachloro-1,1′,3,3′-tetraethylbenzimidazolylcarbocyanine iodide;
  Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) according to the manufacturer’s instructions
  [33].
- MDA-MB-231 or MCF-7 cells (2.5 × 104 cells/mL) were cultured on coverslips, allowed
  to attach, and then exposed to DMSO (control) or 20 μM ZER for 8 h. Immunocytochemical
  analysis for active Bak and active Bax was performed as described by us previously
  [29].
- The cells were examined under a Leica DC300F microscope at 100× magnification.
- Female severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice (6-8 weeks old) were purchased
  from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA) and acclimated for 1 week prior
  to the start of the experiment.
- Following 1 week feeding of irradiated AIN-76A diet (Harlan Teklad, Madison, WI),
  exponentially growing MDA-MB231-luc-D3H1 cells (Caliper Life Sciences, Hopkinton,
  MA) were suspended in media and mixed in a 1:1 ratio with Matrigel.
- A 0.03 mL suspension containing 2.5 × 106 cells was injected orthotopically in both
  inguinal mammary fat pads.
- On the same day, the mice began intraperitoneal administration of either PBS (100
  μL) or ZER (0.18 or 0.35 mg ZER/mouse; equates to about 7.5 and 15.7 mg ZER/kg body
  weight, respectively, in 100 μL PBS) five times/week (Monday through Friday).
- At the onset of the study, there were 10 mice in each group.
- Number of effective mice at the conclusion of the study was _n_ = 6 for the control
  group and 0.18 mg ZER/mouse groups and _n_ = 7 for the 0.35 mg ZER/mouse group because
  of premature deaths unrelated to treatment and/or failure of tumor take.
- In the 0.35 mg ZER/mouse group, tumor grew only on one flank in two mice.
- Body weights of the mice were recorded weekly.
- A portion of the tumor tissue was fixed in 10 % neutral-buffered formalin, dehydrated,
  embedded in paraffin, and sectioned at 4–5 μm thickness.
- TUNEL staining and immunohistochemical analysis for Ki-67 expression was performed
  as described by us previously [5–8].
- Structure of ZER is shown in Fig.
- 1a.
- Viability of MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells was decreased significantly upon treatment
  with ZER in a concentration- and time-dependent manner as evidenced by trypan blue
  dye exclusion assay (Fig.
- 1b) and cell proliferation assay (results not shown).
- For example, the IC50 for ZER in MDA-MB-231 cells after 24 and 48 h exposure was
  9.9 ± 4.9 μM and 4.2 ± 1.2 μM (_n_ = 3), respectively.
- The IC50 for ZER in MCF-7 cells after 24 and 48 h treatment was 10.1 ± 5.3 and 2.9
  ± 0.8 μM (_n_ = 3), respectively.
- Exposure of MDA-MB-231 (Fig.
- 1c) and MCF-7 cells (results not shown) to ZER resulted in an increase in sub-diploid
  (indicative of apoptosis) and G2/M fraction that was accompanied by a reduction
  in G0G1 phase and S phase cells compared with DMSO-treated control.
- The G2/M phase cell cycle arrest resulting from ZER treatment was maintained when
  the cells were cultured for an additional 24 h in the absence of the drug (results
  not shown).
- The ZER-induced G2/M phase cell cycle arrest was associated with a marked decrease
  in protein levels of cyclin B1, Cdk1, Cdc25C, and Cdc25B in both MDA-MB-231 and
  MCF-7 cells (Fig.
- 1d).

  Figure 2a shows representative flow histograms for Annexin V-FITC-positive and PI-negative
  (early apoptotic cells) and Annexin V-FITC-positive and PI-positive (late apoptotic
  cells) fraction in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cultures treated for 48 h with DMSO or ZER.'
- Fraction of apoptotic cells was increased markedly upon treatment with ZER (Fig.
- 2b).
- Consistent with these results, the ZER-treated MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells (24 h
  treatment) exhibited a dose-dependent and statistically significant increase in
  histone-associated DNA fragment release into the cytosol compared with corresponding
  DMSO-treated controls (Fig.
- 2c).
- Finally, apoptosis induction by ZER in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells was confirmed
  by immunoblotting for cleaved PARP (Fig.
- 2d).
- In contrast to MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells, ZER treatment (5–50 μM for 24 h) failed
  to induce histone-associated DNA fragment release into the cytosol in MCF-10A cells
  (data not shown).
- Collectively, these results indicated that breast cancer cells were more sensitive
  to ZER-mediated apoptosis compared with normal cells.
- Zerumbone (ZER) treatment caused apoptotic cell death in cultured human breast cancer
  cells.

  PUMA is a BH3-only member of the Bcl-2 family of proapoptotic proteins that facilitates
  apoptosis by different stimuli [34].'
- There was a marked increase in the levels of PUMA protein after treatment with ZER
  in both MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells (Fig.
- 3a).
- Because PUMA is a p53-regulated protein, these results indicated that PUMA induction
  resulting from ZER treatment involved p53-independent mechanism(s).
- However, PUMA was dispensable for ZER-mediated apoptosis induction (Fig.
- 3b) as well as inhibition of cell proliferation (Fig.
- 3c) as evidenced by analysis in wild-type and PUMA KO variants of HCT-116 cells.
- Likewise, even though ZER treatment resulted in stabilization of p53 protein in
  MCF-7 cells (Fig.
- 3d), the ZER-induced enrichment of sub-diploid apoptotic fraction (Fig.
- 3e) as well as G2/M fraction (Fig.
- 3f) was sustained even after knockdown of the p53 protein by 60 %.
- Based on these observations, we conclude that both p53 and PUMA proteins are dispensable
  for cellular responses to ZER.
- p53 and PUMA are dispensable for zerumbone (ZER)-induced apoptosis.
- a Immunoblotting for PUMA (p53-upregulated mediator of apoptosis) using lysates

  Because ZER was previously shown to modulate levels of Bcl-2 protein in liver cancer
  cells [22], we determined its role in breast cancer cell apoptosis by ZER.'
- As can be seen in Fig.
- 4a, ZER treatment (20 or 40 μM for 24 and 36 h) resulted in a decrease in protein
  levels of Bcl-2 in both MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells.
- Transient transfection of MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells with Bcl-2 plasmid resulted
  in 25- and 2.2-fold increase in its protein level, respectively, compared with corresponding
  empty vector-transfected control cells (Fig.
- 4b).
- However, ectopic expression of Bcl-2 failed to abolish ZER-mediated cleavage of
  PARP (Fig.
- 4b), histone-associated DNA fragment release into the cytosol (Fig.
- 4c) or inhibition of cell survival (Fig.
- 4d).
- Even though % survival upon treatment with ZER in vector-transfected control MDA-MB-231
  cells appeared different from that in Bcl-2 overexpressing cells, the difference
  was not significant in any of the 3 independent experiments (Fig.
- 3d).
- Bcl-2 overexpression failed to confer protection against zerumbone (ZER)-induced
  apoptosis.
- Immunoblotting for a Bcl-2 in control and ZER-treated MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells
  and b Bcl-2 and cleaved PARP in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells transiently transfected

- Quantitation relative to DMSO-treated empty vector-transfected cells is shown.
- Significantly different (_P_ &lt; 0.05) compared with a respective DMSO-treated

  We next studied potential involvement of multidomain proapoptotic proteins Bax and
  Bak in ZER-induced apoptosis.'
- The protein levels of Bax and Bak were only modestly increased upon treatment of
  MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells with ZER (Fig.
- 5a).
- Many apoptogenic signals promote conformational change (activation) of Bax and Bak
  which in turn causes their oligomerization to induce pores in the outer membrane
  resulting in a loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential followed by cell death
  [35, 36].
- As shown in Fig.
- 5b, ZER treatment caused collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential as evidenced
  by accumulation of monomeric JC-1 (green fluorescence).
- We performed immunocytochemistry to determine activation of Bax and Bak in cells
  treated with 20 μM of ZER (8 h) using antibodies specific for detection of active
  Bax (6A7; BD Biosciences) and active Bak (AM03; Calbiochem).
- The ZER treatment caused activation of Bax and Bak in both MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7
  cells as evidenced by merging of the Bax- or Bak-associated red fluorescence and
  MitoTracker Green-associated fluorescence leading to appearance of yellow-orange
  color, which was rare in DMSO-treated control cells (Fig.
- 6a).
- The ZER-treated MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells also showed change in the appearance
  of mitochondrial network, as mitochondria that normally have an elongated structure
  acquired a rounded shape with closely packed stacks (Fig.
- 6a).
- Zerumbone (ZER) causes collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential in breast cancer
  cells.
- a Immunoblotting for Bak and Bax using lysates from MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells after

  Critical role for Bax and Bak in zerumbone (ZER)-induced apoptosis.'
- a Fluorescence microscopy for analysis of active Bax and Bak in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7
  cells after 8 h treatment with DMSO or 20 μM of ZER.

  Contribution of Bax and Bak in apoptotic response to ZER was confirmed by comparing
  sensitivities of SV40 immortalized MEF derived from WT and DKO (Bax and Bak double
  knockout) mice.'
- The ZER treatment (20 or 40 μM for 24 or 48 h) caused a dose-dependent increase
  in the apoptotic cells in both WT and DKO MEF, but the apoptosis was significantly
  more pronounced in the WT MEF than in the DKO (Fig.
- 6b,c).
- 'Collectively, these results indicated that: (a) ZER treatment caused activation
  of both Bax and Bak, and (b) Bax and Bak deficiency conferred significant protection
  against ZER-induced apoptosis in immortalized MEF.'
- The WT and DKO MEF is a better cellular model to test the role of Bax and Bak over
  RNA interference which often fails to produce complete knockdown if simultaneously
  attempted for more than one protein.
- We determined the effect of ZER administration on growth of MDA-MB-231 cells implanted
  orthotopically in mammary fat pads of female SCID mice.
- The ZER concentrations used in the present study were within the range utilized
  in previous animal studies [18, 19].
- The initial and final body weights of the control and ZER-treated mice did not differ
  significantly (Fig.
- 7a).
- In this experiment, luciferase expressing MDA-MB-231 (clone Luc D3H1) cells were
  used with the intention to image the mice as well as to quantify bioluminescence.
- However, this was not possible because the number of effective mice was smaller
  than initially planned and due to variability inherent to bioluminescence (results
  not shown).
- Nevertheless, the average wet weight of the tumor after sacrifice of the animals
  was significantly lower in the 0.18 mg ZER/mouse group compared with control group
  (Fig.
- 7b).
- The difference between the control group and the 0.35 mg ZER/mouse group did not
  reach statistical significance due to large data scatter in the later.
- Nevertheless, these results demonstrated in vivo efficacy of ZER against MDA-MB-231
  xenografts.
- Zerumbone (ZER) administration inhibits growth of MDA-MB-231-luc-D3H1 cells in vivo.

  ZER administration resulted in a statistically significant increase in number of
  apoptotic bodies in the tumor as visualized by TUNEL assay (Fig.'
- 7c).
- In addition, expression of proliferation marker Ki-67 [37] was significantly lower
  in the tumors of ZER-treated mice compared with those of control mice, and the difference
  was significant at the 0.35 mg ZER/mouse group (Fig.
- 7d).
- Results presented herein indicate that ZER treatment inhibits survival of human
  breast cancer cells regardless of the estrogen responsiveness or the p53 status.
- Growth inhibitory effect of ZER is associated with cell cycle arrest and apoptosis
  induction.
- Activity of ZER against breast cancer is not restricted to cultured cells as growth
  of MDA-MB-231 xenografts in vivo is significantly retarded by ZER administration.
- Consistent with cellular data, antitumor effect of ZER in vivo is accompanied by
  reduced cell proliferation as evidenced by Ki-67 expression and increased apoptosis.
- Moreover, ZER administration is well tolerated by the mice and does not cause weight
  loss or any other side effects.
- Prevention of induced cancers in rodents by ZER has been documented previously [12,
  14, 16], but the present study is the first published report showing in vivo efficacy
  of this compound against transplanted breast cancer cells.
- These observations provide impetus for future in vivo evaluation of ZER for prevention
  of mammary cancer in preclinical models to justify its clinical investigation as
  a chemopreventive agent.
- In this context, it is important to mention that addition of a different variety
  of ginger (_Z officinale_) (1.5 g/d in three divided doses every 8 h) to standard
  antiemetic therapy (granisetron plus dexamethasone) in patients with advanced breast
  cancer effectively reduces the prevalence of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting
  [38].
- In a phase II study, ginger root extract decreased eicosanoids in colon mucosa in
  people at normal risk for colorectal cancer [39].
- The present study shows that breast cancer cells are arrested in G2/M phase of the
  cell cycle after treatment with ZER.
- While these observations are consistent with the literature data showing G2/M phase
  cell cycle arrest in ZER-treated leukemia, ovarian and cervical cancer cells [15,
  25], our data also indicates that the cell cycle arrest resulting from ZER exposure
  is irreversible.
- The G2/M progression is regulated by a kinase complex consisting of cyclin B1 and
  Cdk1 [40] and ZER treatment down regulates both these proteins.
- Downregulation of cyclin B1 and Cdk1 upon treatment with ZER has also been observed
  in leukemia cells [15].
- The Cdc25 family phosphatases play an important role in activation of the cyclin
  B1/Cdk1 complex.
- The ZER-treated cells exhibit a decrease in protein levels of both Cdc25B and Cdc25C
  (present study).
- However, the cell cycle arrest resulting from ZER treatment is not dependent on
  p53, which is a therapeutic advantage because this tumor suppressor is often mutated
  in human cancers including breast cancer [41].
- The present study indicates that PUMA protein, which is involved in regulation of
  apoptosis by different stimuli including some natural products [34, 42], is dispensable
  for apoptosis induction by ZER.
- Likewise, unlike certain other proapoptotic agents [30], Bcl-2 overexpression has
  no meaningful impact on ZER-induced apoptosis.
- We also demonstrate that ZER causes activation of Bax and Bak but has only modest
  effect on their protein levels.
- Effect of ZER on Bak level or activation has not been examined previously to the
  best of our knowledge, but in leukemia cells ZER treatment had no effect on Bax
  protein expression [21].
- A critical role for Bax in apoptosis induction by ZER has been reported in human
  colon cancer cells [24].
- The ZER-induced apoptosis in colon cancer cells is associated with reactive oxygen
  species production [24].
- Interestingly, examples exist to illustrate critical role of reactive oxygen species
  in Bax activation and apoptosis induction by some stimuli, including natural products
  phenethyl isothiocyanate (a constituent of watercress) and Withaferin A (a small
  molecule derived from a medicinal plant used in India) [43–45].
- It is possible that Bax and Bak activation by ZER in breast cancer cells is linked
  to production of reactive oxygen species.
- Further work is needed to experimentally verify this possibility.
