- Epidemiologic studies repeatedly have shown chemopreventive effects of cruciferous
  vegetables.
- Indole-3-carbinol (I3C) and its metabolite diindolylmethane (DIM) were identified
  in these plants as active ingredients and theirs anti-tumor activities were confirmed
  in multiple _in vitro_ and _in vivo_ experiments.
- Here, we demonstrate that DIM is a selective and potent inhibitor of cancer stem
  cells (CSCs).
- In several cancer cell lines, DIM inhibited tumor sphere formation at the concentrations
  30-300 times lower than concentrations required for growth inhibition of parental
  cells cultured as adherent culture.
- We also found that treatment with DIM overcomes chemoresistance of CSCs to cytotoxics,
  such as paclitaxel, doxorubicin, and SN-38.
- Pre-treatment of tumor spheres with DIM before implantation to mice significantly
  retarded the growth of primary tumors compared to tumors formed by untreated tumor
  spheres.
- The concentrations of DIM required to suppress CSCs formation are in the close range
  to those achievable in human plasma after oral dosing of the compound.
- Therefore, DIM can potentially be used in cancer patients, either alone, or in combinations
  with existing drugs.
