- Almonds are known to have a number of nutritional benefits, including cholesterol-lowering
  effects and protection against diabetes.
- They are also a good source of minerals and vitamin E, associated with promoting
  health and reducing the risk for chronic disease.
- For this study we investigated the potential prebiotic effect of almond seeds in
  vitro by using mixed fecal bacterial cultures.
- Two almond products, finely ground almonds (FG) and defatted finely ground almonds
  (DG), were subjected to a combined model of the gastrointestinal tract which included
  in vitro gastric and duodenal digestion, and the resulting fractions were subsequently
  used as substrates for the colonic model to assess their influence on the composition
  and metabolic activity of gut bacteria populations.
- FG significantly increased the populations of bifidobacteria and _Eubacterium rectale_,
  resulting in a higher prebiotic index (4.43) than was found for the commercial prebiotic
  fructooligosaccharides (4.08) at 24 h of incubation.
- No significant differences in the proportions of gut bacteria groups were detected
  in response to DG.
- The increase in the numbers of _Eubacterium rectale_ during fermentation of FG correlated
  with increased butyrate production.
- In conclusion, we have shown that the addition of FG altered the composition of
  gut bacteria by stimulating the growth of bifidobacteria and _Eubacterium rectale_.
