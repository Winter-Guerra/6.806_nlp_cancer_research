- 'Abstract:  It has been well established that complex mixtures of phytochemicals
  in fruits and vegetables can be beneficial for human health.'
- Moreover, it is becoming increasingly apparent that phytochemicals can influence
  the pharmacological activity of drugs by modifying their absorption characteristics
  through interactions with drug transporters as well as drug-metabolizing enzyme
  systems.
- Such effects are more likely to occur in the intestine and liver, where high concentrations
  of phytochemicals may occur.
- Alterations in cytochrome P450 and other enzyme activities may influence the fate
  of drugs subject to extensive first-pass metabolism.
- Although numerous studies of nutrient-drug interactions have been published and
  systematic reviews and meta-analyses of these studies are available, no generalizations
  on the effect of nutrient-drug interactions on drug bioavailability are currently
  available.
- Several publications have highlighted the unintended consequences of the combined
  use of nutrients and drugs.
- Many phytochemicals have been shown to have pharmacokinetic interactions with drugs.
- The present review is limited to commonly consumed fruits and vegetables with significant
  beneficial effects as nutrients and components in folk medicine.
- 'Here, we discuss the phytochemistry and pharmacokinetic interactions of the following
  fruit and vegetables: grapefruit, orange, tangerine, grapes, cranberry, pomegranate,
  mango, guava, black raspberry, black mulberry, apple, broccoli, cauliflower, watercress,
  spinach, tomato, carrot, and avocado.'
- We conclude that our knowledge of the potential risk of nutrient-drug interactions
  is still limited.
- Therefore, efforts to elucidate potential risks resulting from food-drug interactions
  should be intensified in order to prevent undesired and harmful clinical consequences.
- Dietary habits are an important modifiable environmental factor influencing human
  health and disease.
- Epidemiologic evidence suggests that regular consumption of fruits and vegetables
  may reduce risk of some diseases, including cancer (Liu 2004).
- These properties have been attributed to foods that are rich sources of numerous
  bioactive compounds such as phytochemicals (Milner 2004).
- Modifying the intake of specific foods and/or their bioactive components seems to
  be a prudent, noninvasive, and cost-effective strategy for preventing some diseases
  in people who appear to be "healthy" (Liu 2003).
- As will be discussed in this article, potential problems occur when patients taking
  medicines regularly also consume certain fruits or vegetables.
- Thousands of drugs are commercially available and a great percentage of the population
  takes at least one pharmacologically active agent on a regular basis.
- Given this magnitude of use and variability in individual nutritional status, dietary
  habits, and food composition, there is a high potential for drug-nutrient interactions.
- However, there is a relatively short list of documented fruit/vegetable-drug interactions,
  necessitating further, and extensive clinical evaluation.
- Healthcare providers, such as physicians, pharmacists, nurses, and dietitians, have
  to be aware of important food-drug interactions in order to optimize the therapeutic
  efficacy of prescribed and over-the-counter drugs.
- Here, we review some of the most widely consumed fruits and vegetables to inform
  healthcare providers of possible nutrient-drug interactions and their potential
  clinical significance.
- There are numerous patients who encounter increased risks of adverse events associated
  with drug-nutrient interactions.
- These include elderly patients, patients with cancer and/or malnutrition, gastrointestinal
  tract dysfunctions, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, and chronic diseases that
  require the use of multiple drugs, as well as those receiving enteral nutrition
  or transplants.
- Therefore, the main reason for devoting a major review to nutrient-drug interactions
  is the enormous importance of fruits and vegetables used for their beneficial effects
  as nutrients and as components in folk medicine.
- There are currently few studies that combine a nutrient-based and detailed pharmacological
  approach (Custodio and others 2008), or studies that systematically explore the
  risk and benefits of fruit and vegetables (Franco and others 2004; Ortega 2006;
  Dangour and others 2010).
- A drug-nutrient interaction is defined as the result of a physical, chemical, physiological,
  or pathophysiological relationship between a drug and a nutrient (Santos and Boullata
  2005; Genser 2008).
- An interaction is considered significant from a clinical perspective if it alters
  the therapeutic response.
- 'Food-drug interactions can result in 2 main clinical effects: the decreased bioavailability
  of a drug, which predisposes to treatment failure, or an increased bioavailability,
  which increases the risk of adverse events and may even precipitate toxicities (see
  Figure 1) (Singh 1999; Singh and Malhotra 2004; Custodio and others 2008).'
- Figure 1-.
- Drug-fruit/vegetable interaction and effects on bioavailability of drugs.
- During the consumption of drugs with fruits or vegetables, the ADME properties of
  drug (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) can be modified by drug-phytochemical
  interaction.
- As a result of this, interaction can be increased or decreased plasma concentrations
  of a drug that can lead to the presence of adverse events or treatment failure.
- Nutritional status and diet can affect drug action by altering metabolism and function.
- In addition, various dietary components can have pharmacological activity under
  certain circumstances (Schmidt and Dalhoff 2002).
- For healthy-treatment intervention, it is necessary to understand how these drug-food
  interactions can induce a beneficial result or lead to detrimental therapeutic conditions
  (less therapeutic action or more toxicity).
- Drug-drug interactions are widely recognized and evaluated as part of the drug-approval
  process, whether pharmaceutical, pharmacokinetic, or pharmacodynamic in nature.
- Equal attention must be paid to food-drug interactions (Figure 2).
- There are 4 types of accepted drug-food interactions based on their nature and mechanisms.
- Type I is _ex vivo_ bioinactivations, which refer to interactions between the drug
  and the nutritional element or formulation through biochemical or physical reactions,
  such as hydrolysis, oxidation, neutralization, precipitation, or complexation.
- These interactions usually occur in the delivery device.
- Type II interactions affect absorption.
- They cause either an increase or decrease in the oral bioavailability of a drug.
- The precipitant agent may modify the function of enzymes or transport mechanisms
  that are responsible for biotransformation.
- Type III interactions affect the systemic or physiologic disposition and occur after
  the drug or the nutritional element has been absorbed from the gastrointestinal
  tract and entered the systemic circulation.
- Changes in the cellular or tissue distribution, systemic transport, or penetration
  to specific organs or tissues can occur.
- Type IV interactions refer to the elimination or clearance of drugs or nutrients,
  which may involve the antagonism, impairment, or modulation of renal and/or enterohepatic
  elimination (Chan 2006).
- Drug-metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters play important roles in modulating
  drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination.
- Acting alone or in concert with each other, they can affect the pharmacokinetics
  and pharmacodynamics of a drug.
- The interplay between drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters is one of the confounding
  factors that have been recently shown to contribute to potential complex drug interactions
  (Muntane 2009).
- The oral administration of drugs to patients is convenient, practical, and preferred
  for many reasons.
- Oral administration of drugs, however, may lead to limited and variable oral bioavailability
  because of absorption across the intestinal barrier (Sai 2005).
- Drug absorption across the gastrointestinal tract is highly dependent on affinity
  for membrane transporters as well as lipophilicity (Ayrton and Morgan 2001).
- On the other hand, the liver plays a key role in the clearance and excretion of
  many drugs.
- Hepatic transporters are membrane proteins that primarily facilitate nutrient and
  endogenous substrate transport into the cell via uptake transporters, or protect
  the cell by pumping out toxic chemicals via canalicular transporters (Li and others
  2009).
- Consequently, drug transporters in both the gut and the liver are important in determining
  oral drug disposition by controlling absorption and bioavailability (Kohl 2009).
- The major uptake transporters responsible for nutrient and xenobiotic transport,
  both uptake and efflux transporters, belong to the 2 solute carrier (SLC and SLCO)
  superfamilies (The International Transporter Consortium 2010).
- The SLC superfamily encompasses a variety of transporters, including the organic
  anion transporters (OAT, SLC22A), the organic cation transporters (OCT, SLC22A),
  the electroneutral organic cation transporters (OCTN, SLC22A), the equilibrative
  nucleoside transporters (ENT, SLC29), the concentrative nucleoside transporters
  (CNT, SLC28), the apical Na+-dependent bile salt transporter (ASBT, SLC10), the
  monocarboxylate transporters (MCT, SLC16), and the peptide transporters (PEPT, SLC15)
  (VanWert and others 2010).
- The SLCO family is made up of the organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATP)
  (Hagenbuch and Gui 2008).
- Efflux transporters expressed in the intestine and liver include P-glycoprotein
  (Pgp, ABCB1), bile salt export pump (BSEP, ABCB11), multidrug resistance proteins
  (MRP1- 6, ABCC1-6), and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP, ABCG2), all members
  of the ATP-binding cassette superfamily (ABC transporters) (Schinkel and Jonker
  2003).
- Members of this superfamily use ATP as an energy source, allowing them to pump substrates
  against a concentration gradient.
- In the liver, uptake transporters are mainly expressed in the sinusoid, and excretion
  transporters are mainly expressed on the lateral and canalicular membranes.
- There are transporters on the lateral membrane the primary function of which is
  pumping drugs back into the blood circulation from the hepatocytes.
- Nowadays, a large amount of work has identified and characterized intestinal and
  hepatic transporters in regards to tissue expression profiles, regulation, mechanisms
  of transport, substrate and inhibitor profiles, species differences, and genetic
  polymorphisms.
- Given the circumstances outlined above, there is no doubt of the overall relevance
  of drug transport for clinical pharmacokinetics.
- Until recently, little regard was given to the possibility that food and food components
  could cause significant changes to the extent of drug absorption via effects on
  intestinal and liver transporters.
- It is now well known that drug-food interactions might affect the pharmacokinetics
  of prescribed drugs when coadministered with food (Huang and others 2008).
- Common foods, such as fruits and vegetables, contain a large variety of secondary
  metabolites known as phytochemicals (Figure 3), many of which have been associated
  with health benefits (Wink 2008).
- However, we know little about the processes through which these phytochemicals (and/or
  their metabolites) are absorbed into the body, reach their biological target, and
  are eliminated.
- Recent studies show that some of these phytochemicals are substrates and modulators
  of specific members of the superfamily of ABC transporting proteins (Telang and
  others 2009).
- Indeed, _in vitro_ and preclinical data in rats suggest that a variety of foodstuffs
  (Huang and others 2008; Tomlinson and others 2008), including herbal teas (Dresser
  and others 2002; Meijerman and others 2006) and vegetables and herbs (Zhou and others
  2004; Alvarez and others 2010), can modulate the activity of drug transporters.
- It is not yet known whether these effects are predictive of what will be observed
  clinically.
- Figure 3-.
- Chemical structures of the major phytochemicals present in fruit and vegetables.
- It has been shown that, before reaching the systemic circulation, the metabolism
  of orally ingested drugs ("first-pass metabolism" or "presystemic clearance") has
  clinically relevant influences on the potency and efficacy of drugs.
- Both the intestine and liver account for the presystemic metabolism in humans.
- Drug metabolism reactions are generally grouped into 2 phases.
- Phase I reactions involve changes such as oxidation, reduction, and hydrolysis and
  are primarily mediated by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) family of enzymes.
- Phase II reactions use an endogenous compound such as glucuronic acid, glutathione,
  or sulfate, to conjugate with the drug or its phase I-derived metabolite to produce
  a more polar end product that can be more readily excreted (Rushmore and Kong 2002).
- The CYP enzymes involved in drug metabolism in humans are expressed predominantly
  in the liver.
- However, they are also present in the large and small intestine, lungs, and brain
  (Watkins 1992).
- CYP proteins are categorized into families and subfamilies and can metabolize almost
  any organic xenobiotic (Rendic 2002).
- CYP enzymes combined with drug transport proteins constitute the first-pass effect
  of orally administered drugs (Rushmore and Kong 2002).
- 'On the other hand, the phase II drug-metabolizing or conjugating enzymes consist
  of many enzyme superfamilies, including sulfotransferases (SULT), UDP-glucuronosyltransferases
  (UGT), DT-diaphorase or NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase (NQO) or NAD(P)H: menadione
  reductase (NMO), epoxide hydrolases (EPH), glutathione S-transferases (GST), and
  _N_-acetyltransferases (NAT).'
- The conjugation reactions by phase II drug-metabolizing enzymes increase hydrophilicity
  and thereby enhance excretion in the bile and/or the urine and consequently affect
  detoxification (Iyanagi 2007).
- The metabolism of a drug can be altered by foreign chemicals and such interactions
  can often be clinically significant (Xu and others 2005).
- The most common form of drug interactions entail a foreign chemical acting either
  as an inhibitor or an inducer of the CYP enzyme isoform responsible for metabolizing
  an administered medicinal drug, subsequently leading to an unusually slow or fast
  clearance of said drug (Saxena and others 2008; Foti and others 2010).
- Inhibition of drug metabolism will result in a concentration elevation in tissues,
  leading to various adverse reactions, particularly for drugs with a low therapeutic
  index.
- Often, influence on drug metabolism by compounds that occur in the environment,
  most remarkably foodstuffs, is bypassed.
- Dietary changes can alter the expression and activity of hepatic drug-metabolizing
  enzymes.
- Although this can lead to alterations in the systemic elimination kinetics of drugs
  metabolized by these enzymes, the magnitude of the change is generally small (Walter-Sack
  and Klotz 1996; Santos and Boullata 2005).
- Metabolic food-drug interactions occur when a certain food alters the activity of
  a drug-metabolizing enzyme, leading to a modulation of the pharmacokinetics of drugs
  metabolized by the enzyme (Schmidt and Dalhoff 2002).
- Foods, such as fruits, vegetables, alcoholic beverages, teas, and herbs, which consist
  of complex chemical mixtures, can inhibit or induce the activity of drug-metabolizing
  enzymes (Mandlekar and others 2006).
- The observed induction and inhibition of CYP enzymes by natural products in the
  presence of a prescribed drug has (among other reasons) led to the general acceptance
  that natural therapies can have adverse effects, contrary to popular beliefs in
  countries with active ethnomedicinal practices.
- Herbal medicines, such as St. John's wort, garlic, piperine, ginseng, and gingko,
  which are freely available over the counter, have given rise to serious clinical
  interactions when coadministered with prescription medicines (Nahrstedt and Butterweck
  2010).
- Such adversities have spurred various preclinical and _in vitro_ investigations
  on a series of other herbal remedies, with their clinical relevance yet to be established.
- The CYP3A4-related interaction based on food component is the best known; it might
  be related to the high level of expression of CYP3A4 in the small intestine, as
  well as its broad substrate specificity.
- If we consider that CYP3A4 is responsible for the metabolism of more than 50% of
  clinical pharmaceuticals, all nutrient-drug interactions should be considered clinically
  relevant, in which case all clinical studies of drugs should include a food-drug
  interaction screening (Kimura and others 2010).
- Fruits and vegetables are known to be important components in a healthy diet, since
  they have low energy density and are sources of micronutrients, fiber, and other
  components with functional properties, called phytochemicals (see Figure 2).
- Increased fruit and vegetable consumption can also help displace food high in saturated
  fats, sugar, or salt.
- Low fruit and vegetable intake is among the top 10 risk factors contributing to
  mortality.
- According to the World Health Organization (WHO), increased daily fruit and vegetable
  intake could help prevent major chronic noncommunicable diseases (WHO 2003).
- Evidence is emerging that specific combinations of phytochemicals may be far more
  effective in protecting against some diseases than isolated compounds (Table 1 and
  2).
- Observed drug-phytochemical interactions, in addition to interactions among dietary
  micronutrients, indicate possibilities for improved therapeutic strategies.
- However, several reports have examined the effects of plant foods and herbal medicines
  on drug bioavailability.
- As shown in Table 3 and 4 and as discussed below, we have surveyed the literature
  to identify reports suggesting important food and phytochemical modulation of drug-metabolizing
  enzymes and drug transporters leading to potential important nutrient-drug interactions.
- The interaction of grapefruit with certain drugs was unintentionally discovered
  2 decades ago (Flanagan 2005).
- Since then, there have been numerous reports on the effects of grapefruit and its
  components on CYP450 drug oxidation and transportation (Cuciureanu and others 2010;
  Hanley and others 2011).
- Several findings showed that grapefruit juice had a major effect on the intestinal
  CYP system with a minor effect at the hepatic level (Bressler 2006).
- The predominant mechanism for this interaction is the inhibition of cytochrome P450
  3A4 in the small intestine, which results in a significant reduction of drug presystemic
  metabolism.
- Grapefruit juice intake has been found to decrease CYP3A4 mRNA activity through
  a post transcriptional activity, possibly by facilitating degradation of the enzyme
  (Kim and others 2006).
- An additional mechanism may be the inhibition of Pgp- and MRP2-mediated drug efflux,
  transporters that carry drugs from enterocytes back to the gut lumen, all of which
  results in a further increase in the fraction of drug absorbed and increased systemic
  drug bioavailability (Honda and others 2004; Konishi and others 2004; Yoo and others
  2007).
- It has also been reported that the major constituents of grapefruit significantly
  inhibit the OATP-B function _in vitro_ (Satoh and others 2005; Greenblatt 2009).
- The interaction between grapefruit juice and drugs has been potentially ascribed
  to a number of constituents (Huang and others 2004).
- It has been suggested that flavonoids, such as naringin, naringenin, quercetin,
  and kaempferol, major components in grapefruit, are responsible for drug interaction.
- Some of these chemicals are also found in other fruit juices.
- Pomegranate, for example, shares certain properties with grapefruit, suggesting
  that both could modify the bioavailability of drugs (Takanaga and others 2000; Hidaka
  and others 2005).
- Another group of compounds that have been detected in grapefruit juice are the furanocoumarins
  (psoralens), which are known to be mechanism-based inactivators of CYP450.
- The major furanocoumarin present in grapefruit is bergamottin, which demonstrated
  a time- and concentration-dependent inactivation of CYP enzymes _in vitro_ (Kim
  and others 2006).
- One interesting characteristic of this interaction is that grapefruit juice does
  not need to be taken simultaneously with the medication in order to produce the
  interaction.
- The bioavailability of drugs has been reported to be doubled by grapefruit juice,
  even when taken 12 h after ingestion.
- Colored grapefruit juice and white grapefruit juice are equally effective in producing
  drug interactions.
- This inhibitory interaction should be kept in mind when prescribing drugs metabolized
  by CYP3A4.
- Examples of drugs affected by grapefruit or its components include calcium-channel
  antagonists such as felodipine, nisoldipine, amlodipines, verapamil, and diltiazem
  (Sica 2006); central nervous system modulators including diazepam, triazolam, midazolam,
  alprazolam, carbamazepine, buspurone, and sertraline (Pawełczyk and Kłoszewska 2008);
  HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors such as simvastatin, lovastatin, atorvastatin, and
  pravastatin (Reamy and Stephens 2007); immunosuppressants such as cyclosporine (Paine
  and others 2008); antivirals such as saquinavir (Van den Bout-van den Beukel and
  others 2006); a phosphodiesterases-5 inhibitor such as sildenafil (Bailey and Dresser
  2004); antihistamines including as terfenadine and fexofenadine (Dresser and others
  2005); antiarhythmics such as amiodarone (Bailey and Dresser 2004); and antibiotics
  such as eritromicine (Amory and Amory 2005).
- Epidemiologic studies reveal that approximately 2% of the population in the United
  States consumes at least one glass of regular strength grapefruit juice per day.
- This becomes pertinent if we consider that many people suffer from chronic metabolic
  diseases (including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and cardiovascular diseases) and
  receive calcium-channel antagonis therapy and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors.
- Patients with mental disorders also chronically receive central nervous system modulators.
- In the case of many drugs, an increase in serum drug concentration has been associated
  with increased frequency of dose-dependent adverse effects (Saito and others 2005;
  Kiani and Imam 2007; Pillai and others 2009).
- In light of the wide ranging effects of grapefruit juice on the pharmacokinetics
  of various drugs, physicians need to be aware of these interactions and should make
  an attempt to warn and educate patients regarding the potential consequences of
  concomitant ingestion of these agents.
- Consumption of most types of orange juice does not appear to alter CYP3A4 activity
  _in vivo_ (Takanaga and others 2000).
- However, orange juice made from Seville oranges appears to be somewhat similar to
  grapefruit juice and can affect the pharmacokinetics of CYP3A4 substrates (Ho and
  others 2000).
- It has been previously shown that consumption of a single 240-mL serving of Sevilla
  orange juice resulted in a 76% increase in felodipine exposure, comparable to what
  is observed after grapefruit juice consumption (Malhotra and others 2001).
- Presumably, the mechanism of this effect is similar to that of grapefruit juice-mediated
  interactions, because Sevilla orange contains significant concentrations of flavonoids,
  mainly bergamottin and 6′,7′-dihydroxybergamottin (Kamath and others 2005).
- Orange juice has also been shown to exert inhibitory effects on Pgp-mediated drug
  efflux.
- Takanaga and others showed that 3,3′,4′,5,6,7,8-heptamethoxyflavon and tangeretin
  were the major Pgp inhibitors present in orange juice and showed that another component,
  nobiletin, was also a Pgp inhibitor (Takanaga and others 2000).
- Therefore, the intake of orange juice might inhibit the efflux transporters by Pgp,
  which could enhance the bioavailability of drugs and thus lead to an increase in
  the risk of adverse events (Yoo and others 2007).
- It has also been observed that components of orange juice--naringin in particular--are
  _in vitro_ inhibitors of OATP transport activity (Farkas and Greenblatt 2008).
- Dresser and others have previously reported that orange juice inhibits the function
  of human OATP-A (OATP1A2, gene symbol _SLC21A3/SLCO1A2_) _in vitro_ (Dresser and
  others 2002).
- OATP-A, however, is predominantly expressed in the brain, but not in the intestine.
- On the other hand, Satoh and others reported that OATP-B-mediated uptake of glibenclamide
  as well as estrone-3-sulfate was significantly inhibited by 5% orange juice (Satoh
  and others 2005).
- Orange juice might reduce the intestinal absorption of substrates of OATP-B (for
  example, digoxin, benzylpenicillin, and hormone conjugates), resulting in a decrease
  in concentration in the blood.
- Previous studies in humans using fexofenadine as a probe showed that oral coadministration
  with orange juice decreased the oral bioavailability of fexofenadine (Dresser and
  others 2005).
- Orange juice and its constituents were shown to interact with members of the OATP
  transporter family by reducing their activities.
- The functional consequences of such an interaction are reflected in a significant
  reduction in the oral bioavailability of fexofenadine, possibly by preferential
  direct inhibition of intestinal OATP activity.
- Other reports indicate that orange juice slightly reduced the absorption of ciprofloxacin,
  levofloxacin, and celiprolol (Saito and others 2005).
- A study of an interaction between orange juice and pravastatin showed an increase
  in area under curve (Greenblatt 2009).
- Orange juice also moderately reduces the bioavailability of atenolol, which may
  necessitate a dose adjustment (Lilja and others 2004, 2005).
- Early studies demonstrated the influence of tangeretin, a flavonoid found in high
  levels in tangerine juice, on drug-metabolizing liver enzymes.
- It was demonstrated that tangeretin inhibits P450 1A2 and P450 3A4 activity in human
  liver microsomes (Obermeier and others 1995).
- Tangeretin is a potent regioselective stimulator of midazolam 1′-hydroxylation by
  human liver microsomes CYP3A4.
- Although clinical studies have shown no influence on midazolam pharmacokinetics
  _in vivo_, further studies are needed to evaluate its effects on other drugs (Backman
  and others 2000).
- Diosmin is one of the main components of citrus fruits, such as tangerine.
- Diosmin may increase the absorption or bioavailability of coadministered drugs able
  to serve as Pgp substrates.
- As a result, some caution may be required with its clinical use (Yoo and others
  2007).
- Grapes are one of the most valued conventional fruits worldwide.
- The grape is considered a source of unique and potentially useful medicinal natural
  products; they are also used in the manufacturing of various industrial products
  (Yadav and others 2009; Vislocky and Fernandez 2010).
- The main biologically active and well-characterized constituent from the grape is
  resveratrol, which is known for various medicinal properties in treating human diseases
  (Yadav and others 2009).
- Resveratrol was shown to be an irreversible (mechanism-based) inhibitor of CYP3A4
  and a noncompetitive reversible inhibitor for CYP2E1 in microsomes from rat liver
  and human liver cells containing cDNA-expressed CYPs (Chan and Delucchi 2000; Piver
  and others 2001).
- Resveratrol is an electron-rich molecule with 2 aromatic benzene rings linked by
  an ethylene bridge.
- CYP3A-mediated aromatic hydroxylation and epoxidation of resveratrol are possible,
  resulting in a reactive p-benzoquinone methide metabolite that is capable of binding
  covalently to CYP3A4, leading to inactivation, and potential drug interactions.
- American cranberry is a fruit used as a prophylactic agent against urinary tract
  infections (Rossi and others 2010).
- Drug interactions with cranberry juice might be related to the fact that the juice
  is rich in flavonol glycosides, anthocyanins, proanthocyanidins, and organic and
  phenolic acids (Cote and others 2010).
- Izzo (2005) described a total of 8 cases of interaction between cranberry juice
  and warfarin, leading to changes in international normalized ratio (INR) values,
  and bleeding.
- The mechanism behind this interaction might be the inhibition by cranberry flavonoids
  of CYP3A4 and/or CYP2C9 enzymes, which are responsible for warfarin metabolism (Zhou
  and others 2004; Izzo 2005; Pham and Pham 2007).
- It has also been shown that cranberry juice inhibits diclofenac metabolism in human
  liver microsomes, but this has not been demonstrated clinically in human subjects
  (Ushijima and others 2009).
- Cranberry juice may increase the bioavailability of CYP3A4 substrates (for example,
  calcium antagonists or calcineurin inhibitors) as discussed by Van den Bout-Van
  den Beukel and others (2006).
- Uesawa and Mohri have demonstrated that nifedipine metabolism in rat intestinal
  and human hepatic microsomes are inhibited by preincubation with cranberry juice.
- Furthermore, cranberry juice increased the nifedipine concentration in rat plasma.
- These findings suggest that cranberry juice might affect the plasma concentration
  of nifedipine in humans as well (Uesawa and Mohri 2006).
- Pomegranate is commonly eaten around the world and has been used in folk medicine
  for a wide variety of therapeutic purposes (Shabtay and others 2008; Ross 2009;
  Oliveira and others 2010).
- Pomegranate is a rich source of several chemicals such as pectin, tannins, flavonoids,
  and anthocyanins.
- Hidaka and others (2005) have reported that pomegranate juice influenced the pharmacokinetics
  of carbamazepine in rats by inhibiting enteric CYP3A activity.
- Such inhibition of the enteric CYP3A activity by a single exposure to pomegranate
  juice appears to last for approximately 3 d. Nagata and others (2007) found that
  pomegranate juice inhibited human CYP2C9 activity and increased tolbutamide bioavailability
  in rats.
- Recently, pomegranate juice was shown to potently inhibit the sulfoconjugation of
  1-naphthol in Caco-2 cells.
- Saruwatari and others have suggested that some constituents of pomegranate juice,
  most probably punicalagin, may impair the metabolic functions of the intestine (specifically
  sulfoconjugation) and therefore might have effects upon the bioavailability of drugs
  (Saruwatari and others 2008).
- The beneficial effects of mango include anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial activities
  (Knodler and others 2008; Engels and others 2009).
- Preliminary phytochemical screening revealed the presence of flavonoids, including
  quercetin and glycosylated xanthones such as mangiferin (Schieber and others 2003;
  Berardini and others 2005).
- Quercetin has been shown to possess antioxidant, antimicrobial, antitumor, antihypertensive,
  antiatherosclerosis, and anti-inflammatory properties (Bischoff 2008).
- In a series of studies, Rodeiro and others have shown the effects of mango on drug-metabolizing
  enzymes and drug transporters (Rodeiro and others 2008, 2009).
- They found that exposure of hepatocytes to mango extract produced a significant
  reduction (60%) in 7-methoxyresorufin-O-demethylase (MROD; CYP1A2) activity and
  an increase (50%) in 7-penthoxyresorufin-O-depentylase (PROD; CYP2B1) activity.
- 'This group also studied the effect of mangiferin on CYP enzymes and found that
  mangiferin reduced the activities of 5 P450s: POD (CYP1A2), midazolam 1′-hydroxylation
  (M1OH; CYP3A1), diclofenac 4′-hydroxylation (D4OH; CYP2C6), S-mephenytoin 4′-hydroxylation
  (SM4OH), and chlorzoxazone 6-hydroxyaltion (C6OH; CYP2E1).'
- Recently, mango and mango-derived polyphenols have been shown to potentially affect
  the activity of the multidrug transporter Pgp ABCB1 (Chieli and others 2009).
- These findings suggest that mango and its components inhibit the major human P450
  enzymes involved in drug metabolism and some transporters.
- The potential for drug interactions with mango fruit should therefore be considered.
- Guava is an important food crop and medicinal plant in tropical and subtropical
  countries; it is widely used as food and in folk medicine around the world (Jouad
  and others 2001; de Wet and others 2010).
- A number of metabolites, such as phenolics, flavonoid, carotenoid, terpenoid, and
  triterpene, have been found in this fruit.
- Extracts and metabolites of this plant, particularly those from the leaves and fruit,
  possess useful pharmacological activities (Qian and Nihorimbere 2004).
- 'There is only one report about the effect of guava extracts on drug transport:
  guava extract showed a potent inhibitory effect on Pgp-mediated efflux in Caco-2
  cells.'
- It was also found to inhibit efflux transport from serosal to mucosal surfaces in
  the rat ileum (Junyaprasert and others 2006).
- This means that guava could interact with Pgp substrates, such as digoxin, fexofenadine,
  indinavir, vincristine, colchicine, topotecan, and paclitaxel, in the small intestine.
- For this reason, this fruit should be consumed with caution by patients taking medicines.
- Berries have been shown to have a positive impact on several chronic conditions
  including obesity, cancer, and cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases (Patel
  and others 2004; Zafra-Stone and others 2007; Del Rio and others 2010).
- Like other fruits, raspberries contain micro- and macronutrients such as vitamins,
  minerals, and fiber.
- Their biological properties, however, have been largely attributed to high levels
  of various phenolic compounds, as well as the interactive synergies among their
  natural phytochemical components (for example, ellagic acid, quercetin, gallic acid,
  anthocyanins, cyanidins, pelargonidins, catechins, kaempferol, and salicylic acid).
- Raspberry or raspberry constituents have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties
  and inhibit cancer cell growth (Wang and Lin 2000; Juranic and Zixack 2005; Seeram
  and others 2006; Seeram 2008).
- Black raspberries (_Rubus coreanus)_ have been called the "king of berries" for
  their superior health benefits, whereas black mulberry (_Morus nigra)_ is most commonly
  used for its antioxidants properties and for its high bioactive content of phenolics,
  anthocyanins, and gallic acid.
- It has been shown that black raspberry and black mulberry are able to inhibit the
  human CYP3A-catalyzed midazolam 1-hydroxylation activity in liver microsomes, and
  the inhibitory effects are somewhat greater than those of pomegranate (Hidaka and
  others 2005; Kim and others 2006).
- It has also been reported that black mulberry extract potently inhibits OATP-B function
  at concentrations that seem to be physiologically relevant _in vitro_ (Satoh and
  others 2005).
- These results suggest that black raspberry and black mulberry may decrease the plasma
  concentrations of concomitantly ingested OATP-B substrate drugs or increase the
  plasma concentration levels of concomitantly ingested CYP3A-substrate drugs.
- _In vivo_ studies on the interaction between black mulberry and black raspberry
  and CYP3A substrates are needed to determine whether inhibition of CYP3A activity
  by fruit juices is clinically relevant.
- Apple and its products contain high amounts of polyphenols, which show diverse biological
  activities and may contribute to beneficial health effects such as protecting the
  intestine against inflammation due to chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (Lewis
  and Ruud 2004; Gerhauser 2008).
- Pohl and others (2006) found that apple juice extract inhibits CYP1A1 at levels
  of CYP1A1 mRNA, protein, and enzymatic activity.
- On the other hand, it has also been reported that apple juice and its constituents
  can interact with members of the OATP transporter family (OATP-1, OATP-3, and NTCP)
  by reducing their activities _in vitro_.
- The functional consequence of such an interaction was a significant reduction in
  the oral bioavailability of fexofenadine in human plasma levels, possibly by preferential
  direct inhibition of intestinal OATP activity (Dresser and others 2002).
- These findings suggest that apple might interact with OATP substrates (for example,
  estrone-3-sulfate, deltorphin II, fexofenadine, vasopressin, and rosuvastatin).
- Broccoli (_Brassica oleracea var.
- italica)_ and cauliflower (_B.
- oleracea var.
- botrytis)_ are unique among the common cruciferous vegetables that contain high
  levels of the aliphatics glucosinolate and glucoraphanin (Cartea and others 2010).
- Upon hydrolysis, glucoraphanin produces several products that include the bioactive
  isothiocyanate sulforaphane.
- The percentage of isothiocyanate sulforaphane present in these vegetables may vary
  depending on conditions of hydrolysis, food handling, and preparation procedures
  (Tian and others 2005; Velasco and others 2011).
- In animal studies, dietary freeze-dried broccoli was found to offer protection against
  several cancers (Vasanthi and others 2009).
- However, broccoli, cauliflower, and their glucosinolate hydrolysis products have
  been shown to induce phase I and phase II drug-metabolizing enzymes in intact liver
  cells from both rats and humans.
- The isothiocyanate sulforaphane decreased the enzyme activities hepatocytes associated
  with CYP1A1 and 2B1/2, namely ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase and pentoxyresorufin-O-dealkylase,
  respectively, in a dose-dependent manner (Anwar-Mohamed and El-Kadi 2009).
- An increase in hGSTA1/2 mRNA has been observed in isothiocyanate sulforaphane-treated
  human hepatocytes, whereas the expression of CYP3A4, the major CYP in the human
  liver, markedly decreased at both mRNA and activity levels (Fimognari and others
  2008).
- Conversely, it was recently shown that sulforaphane induces mRNA levels of MRP1
  and MRP2 in primary hepatocytes and Caco-2 cells (Harris and Jeffery 2008).
- It has been additionally reported that broccoli is able to induce the activity of
  phenolsulfotransferases (PST) (Yeh and Yen 2005).
- These results suggest that other vegetables with a high content of isothiocyanates,
  such as those of the family _Cruciferae_ (for example, cabbage, cauliflower, Brussels
  sprouts, watercress, broccoli, and kale) and the genus _Raphanus_ (radishes and
  daikons) may have pharmacological and toxicological implications in humans.
- Watercress is another important member of the cruciferous vegetables, an excellent
  source for glucosinolates, and other bioactive phytochemicals (Getahun and Chung
  1999).
- Watercress (_Nasturtium officinale)_ is an exceptionally rich dietary source of
  beta-phenylethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC) (Palaniswamy and others 2003).
- Previous studies by Leclercq and others (1998) have shown that a single ingestion
  of watercress inhibits the hydroxylation of chlorzoxazone, an _in vivo_ probe for
  CYP2E1, in healthy volunteers.
- It has also been shown that watercress is a bifunctional agent with the ability
  to induce both phase I (CYP450) and II enzymes.
- Adding watercress juice to human liver cells induced the activity of CYP4501A and
  ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase and NAD(P)H-quinone reductase (Lhoste and others 2004).
- According to reports, PEITC also has several anticarcinogenic effects given that
  it can inhibit phase I enzymes and/or activate phase II enzymes.
- Watercress juice can increase the enzymes _SOD_ and _GPX_ in blood cells _in vitro_
  and _in vivo_ (Hofmann and others 2009).
- Isothiocyanates also interact with ABC efflux transporters such as Ppg, MRP1, MRP2,
  and BCRP and may influence the pharmacokinetics of substrates of these transporters
  (Telang and others 2009).
- According to current data, watercress and isothiocyanate may have clinical repercussions
  by inducing changes in the bioavailability of some drugs.
- Spinach (_Spinacia oleracea)_ is an important antioxidant vegetable usually consumed
  after boiling the fresh or frozen leaves (Schirrmacher and others 2010).
- Freshly cut spinach leaves contain approximately 1000 mg of total flavonoids per
  kilogram, and the occurrence of at least 10 flavonoid glycosides has been reported
  (Bergquist and others 2005).
- These are glucuronides and acylated di-and triglycosides of methylated and methylene
  dioxide derivatives of 6-oxygenated flavonols (Lomnitski and others 2003).
- While epidemiological and preclinical data support the nutritional benefits of spinach
  and the safety of its consumption (Lomnitski and others 2003), there are no publications
  about its effects on drug-metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters.
- Little is currently known about the _in vivo_ effects these compounds have on the
  bioavailability of xenobiotics the clearance and/or tissue distribution of which
  is determined by active transport and biotransformation.
- Platt and others (2010) reported the protective effect of spinach against the genotoxic
  effects of 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ) by interaction with CYP1A2
  as a mechanism of antigenotoxicity.
- Its high isothiocyanate and flavonoid content demands additional research to evaluate
  possible nutrient-drug interactions.
- Tomatoes (_Lycopersicon esculentum)_ and tomato-based products are a source of important
  nutrients and contain numerous phytochemicals, such as carotenoids, that may influence
  health (carotenoids such as phytofluene, phytoene, neurosporene, γ-carotene, and
  ζ-carotene) (Heber 2004; Tan and others 2010).
- Tomatoes are also a source of a vast array of flavonols (for example, quercetin
  and kaempferol), phytosterols, and phenylpropanoids (Ellinger and others 2006).
- Lycopene is the most important carotenoid present in tomatoes and tomato products,
  and their dietary intake has been linked to a decreased risk of chronic illnesses
  such as cancer and cardiovascular disease (Rao and Rao 2007; Riccioni and others
  2008; Waliszewski and Blasco 2010).
- Studies performed on human recombinant CYP1 showed that lycopene inhibits CYP1A1
  and CYP1B1.
- Lycopene has also been shown to slightly reduce the induction of ethoxyresorufin-_O_-deethylase
  activity by 20% by dimethylbenz[a]anthracene in MCF-7 cells (Wang and Leung 2010).
- It appears to inhibit bioactivation enzymes and induce detoxifying enzymes.
- It has been suggested that lycopene might have a potential advantage over other
  phytochemicals by facilitating the elimination of genotoxic chemicals and their
  metabolites (Wang and Leung 2010).
- Recent _in vitro_ evidence suggests that high-dose lycopene supplementation increases
  hepatic cytochrome P4502E1 protein and inflammation in alcohol-fed rats (Veeramachaneni
  and others 2008).
- Carrots (_Daucus carrota)_ are widely consumed as food.
- The active components of carrots, which include beta-carotene and panaxynol, have
  been studied by many researchers (Surles and others 2004; Sikora and others 2009;
  Sun and others 2009).
- Carrots induce PST activity (Yeh and Yen 2005) and decrease CYP1A2 activity (Harris
  and Jeffery 2008).
- Bradfield and others have reported that a carrot diet increased the activity of
  ethoxycoumarin O-deethylase (ECD) activity in a mouse model (Bradfield and others
  1985).
- Avocado (_Persea americana_) is a good source of bioactive compounds such as monounsaturated
  fatty acids and sterols (Duester 2001).
- Growing evidence on the health benefits of avocadoes has led to increased consumption
  and research on potential health benefits (Whiley and Schaffer 2002; Ernst 2003).
- Phytochemicals extracted from avocado can selectively induce several biological
  functions (Lu and others 2005; Plaza and others 2009).
- Two articles published in the 1990s reported avocados interact with warfarin, stating
  that the fruit inhibited the effect of warfarin.
- They, however, did not establish the cause of such inhibition (Blickstein and others
  1991; Wells and others 1994).
- Yeh and Yen have reported that asparagus, cauliflower, celery, and eggplant induced
  significant PST-P activity, whereas asparagus, eggplant, and potato induced PST-M
  activity (Yeh and Yen 2005).
- Harris and Jeffery (2008) have also reported that a diet supplemented with apiaceous
  vegetables (dill weed, celery, parsley, parsnip) resulted in a 13% to 15% decrease
  in CYP1A2 activity.
- The authors speculate that furanocumarins present in the apiaceous vegetables were
  responsible for the inhibitory effects on CYP1A2 (Lampe and others 2000; Harris
  and Jeffery 2008).
- Vegetables, such as cabbage, celery, onion, and parsley, are known to have a high
  content of polyphenols.
- It has been reported that polyphenols can potentially affect phase I metabolism
  either by direct inhibition of phase I enzymes or by regulating the expression of
  enzyme levels via their interactions with regulatory cascades.
- Several studies have directly and indirectly shown that dietary polyphenols can
  modulate phase II metabolism (Lambert and others 2007).
- In addition, polyphenols have been shown to interact with ABC drug transporters
  involved in drug resistance and drug absorption, distribution, and excretion (Alvarez
  and others 2010).
- WHO and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) recommend
  a daily intake of at least 400 g or 5 servings of fruits and vegetables to aid in
  the prevention of chronic illnesses such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and
  obesity.
- As a consequence, there is an increased global consumer demand for fruits and vegetables,
  and some consumers purchase organic foods with the understanding that they are healthy.
- The use of natural products for improving human health has evolved independently
  in different regions of the world and production, use, attitudes, and regulatory
  aspects vary globally.
- Although modern medicine may be available in most countries for the treatment of
  many chronic degenerative diseases, folk medicine (phytomedicine) has remained popular
  for historical and cultural reasons.
- Although the significance of interactions between drugs is widely appreciated, little
  attention has been given to interactions between drugs and nutrients.
- Most of the documented information about the effects of fruit and vegetables on
  metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters comes from preclinical studies.
- However, the possibility that these effects could occur in humans should not be
  ignored.
- Several clinical studies on the interactions of grapefruit juice and drugs have
  been conducted with impressive results.
- Most of the fruits and vegetables examined in this review contain a similar phytochemical
  mix to that of grapefruit juice.
- _In vitro_ models and animal models have shown that many of these agents influence
  drug-metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters.
- It is possible that other fruits and vegetables could have the same potential for
  fruit and drug interactions, and this should be taken into account.
- This review shows evidence of the influence of fruit, vegetables, or their components
  (phytochemicals) on the CYP3A4 enzyme, which metabolizes most drugs used by the
  human population.
- A more consistent approach to the evaluation of nutrient-drug interactions in human
  beings is therefore needed.
- Said approach must be systematic in order to (1) assess the influence of nutritional
  status, foodstuffs, or specific nutrients on a drug's pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics,
  and (2) evaluate the influence of a drug on overall nutritional status or the status
  of a specific nutrient.
- In addition to all this, we must account for the fact that we live in an era of
  very varied lifestyles.
- Some people are vegetarians, others take high doses of flavonoids or antioxidants
  as supplements, some ingest large amounts of bottled water from plastic bottles,
  or use chlorinated disinfectants.
- In industrialized countries, fruits and vegetables tend have been subjected to some
  sort of processing (for example, refrigeration, acidification, fermentation, and
  thermal, high pressure, chemical, or physical processing) that might have an effect
  on the bioactive compound.
- All of these factors could have an impact on the metabolism or transport of drugs
  in a individual, potentially altering pharmacological responses.
- Our knowledge regarding the potential risk of nutrient-drug interactions is still
  limited.
- Therefore, efforts to elucidate potential risk of food-drug interactions should
  be intensified in order to prevent undesired and harmful clinical consequences.
