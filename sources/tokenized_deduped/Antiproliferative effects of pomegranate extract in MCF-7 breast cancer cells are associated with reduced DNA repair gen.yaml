- Pomegranate extract (PE) inhibits the proliferation of breast cancer cells and stimulates
  apoptosis in MCF-7 breast cancer cells.
- While PE is a potent antioxidant, the present studies were conducted to examine
  the mechanisms of action of PE beyond antioxidation by studying cellular and molecular
  mechanisms underlying breast tumorigenesis.
- PE inhibited cell growth by inducing cell cycle arrest in G2/M followed by the induction
  of apoptosis.
- In contrast, antioxidants _N_-acetylcysteine and Trolox did not affect cell growth
  at doses containing equivalent antioxidant capacity as PE, suggesting that growth
  inhibition by PE cannot solely be attributed to its high antioxidant potential.
- DNA microarray analysis revealed that PE downregulated genes associated with mitosis,
  chromosome organization, RNA processing, DNA replication and DNA repair, and upregulated
  genes involved in regulation of apoptosis and cell proliferation.
- Both microarray and quantitative RT-PCR indicated that PE downregulated important
  genes involved in DNA double strand break (DSB) repair by homologous recombination
  (HR), such as _MRE11_, _RAD50_, _NBS1_, _RAD51_, _BRCA1_, _BRCA2_, and _BRCC3_.
- Downregulation of HR genes correlated with increased levels of their predicted microRNAs
  (miRNAs), miR-183 (predicted target RAD50) and miR-24 (predicted target BRCA1),
  suggesting that PE may regulate miRNAs involved in DNA repair processes.
- Further, PE treatment increased the frequency of DSBs.
- These data suggest that PE downregulates HR which sensitizes cells to DSBs, growth
  inhibition and apoptosis.
- Because HR represents a novel target for cancer therapy, downregulation of HR by
  PE may be exploited for sensitization of tumors to anticancer drugs.

  Pomegranate is consumed as whole fruit and also widely available commercially as
  fruit juice, wine, or sauce [1].'
- 'The fruit can be divided into three parts: the seeds, the juice, and the peel.'
- Extracts of all parts of the fruit appear to have therapeutic properties.
- Pomegranate fruit is a rich source of many phenolic compounds including flavonoids
  (anthocyanins, catechins, and other complex flavonoids) and hydrolyzable tannins
  called ellagitannins (punicalin, pedunculagin, punicalagin, gallagic, and ellagic
  acid esters of glucose) [2].
- The concentration of total polyphenols in pomegranate juice (3.8 mg/mL gallic acid
  equivalents) is higher than other fruit juices (grape, blueberry, black cherry,
  cranberry, orange, apple, which contain only 0.4-2.6 mg/mL of gallic acid equivalents)
  [3].
- In turn, pomegranate juice has the highest antioxidant capacity as compared to other
  polyphenol-rich beverages, such as red wine, grape juice, blueberry juice, and green
  tea [3].
- The potent antioxidant properties of pomegranate juice have been thought to be responsible
  for various health benefits.
- However, it has not been established whether antioxidant effects per se can explain
  the actions of pomegranate juice in inhibiting tumor cell growth in vitro.
- The effects of pomegranate extract (PE) containing primarily ellagitannins have
  been evaluated in vitro in terms of antiproliferative, antiinvasive, and proapoptotic
  properties in several different cancer cell lines [4-7].
- Pomegranate juice as a whole has been found to be more effective as compared to
  isolated phytochemicals given individually [8].
- Although the main focus of research has been on prostate cancer, the anticancer
  potential of pomegranate has also been examined in breast cancer albeit only in
  in vitro studies [9-12].
- Different PE preparations reduced growth of both estrogen-receptor positive as well
  as estrogen-receptor negative breast cancer cell lines [10], mammary organ culture
  [9], MMTV-Wnt-1 mouse mammary cancer stem cells [13] and reduced the motility and
  invasion of MDA-231 and SUM 149 cell lines derived from aggressive tumors [12].
- The observed effects were associated with inhibition of NF-κB expression [12] and/or
  inhibition of 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (aromatase), the enzyme that catalyzes
  conversion of estrone to estradiol [11].
- Estradiol has been suggested to increase the risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal
  women leading to recommendations that dietary interventions that reduce estrogen
  synthesis may be beneficial for cancer prevention [14].
- In summary, these studies suggested that pomegranate intake can modulate tumor behavior
  by reducing growth and/or invasiveness as well as suppressing hormonal carcinogenesis
  through reduction of estrogen levels and/or activity.
- While the beneficial properties of pomegranate are being investigated, the studies
  of its adverse effects have not been neglected either.
- Subchronic toxicity study in rats showed that oral administration of PE at 600 mg/kg/d,
  the highest dose tested, for 90 d is devoid of any significant adverse effects based
  on clinical observations, ophthalmic examination, body weights, body weight gains,
  feed consumption, clinical pathology evaluations, organ weights, hematological and
  serum chemistry parameters and gross and histopathology analysis after terminal
  necropsy [15].
- The antioxidant capacity of pomegranate ellagitannins has been proposed to account
  for their pharmacological actions, although the link between antioxidant capacity
  and tumor growth inhibition has not been established.
- The genome-wide transcriptome analysis of PE effects in breast cancer cells has
  not been reported to date.
- In the present study, an integrative approach was applied using Affymetrix gene
  arrays to identify changes in gene expression following treatment with PE in MCF-7
  breast cancer cells and then validating relative mRNA expression by quantitative
  RT-PCR (qRT-PCR).
- In addition, further analysis of the expression of predicted microRNAs (miRNAs)
  for significantly modulated genes was carried out.
- To assess whether the antioxidant effects of PE could explain the observed growth
  inhibition of breast cancer cells, cells were exposed to typical antioxidants, _N_-acetylcysteine
  (NAC) and Trolox.
- PE is a standardized extract (POMX, POM Wonderful, Los Angeles, CA) of pomegranate
  fruit grown in California (_Punica granatum L_., Wonderful variety; Paramount Farms,
  Lost Hills, CA).
- PE is made from fruit skins and consists of 95% glycone ellagitannins (mono and
  oligomeric) standardized to punicalagins (37-40%) and free ellagic acid (3.4%) as
  determined by high-performance liquid chromatography using previously described
  methods [16].
- MCF-7 cells (a gift from Dr. Welsh lab, Cancer Research Center, University at Albany,
  State University of New York) were grown and maintained in Minimum Essential Medium
  Eagle (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) supplemented with 25 mM HEPES (Fisher Scientific,
  Fair Lawn, NJ), 20 mM D-(+)glucose, 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 µg/mL streptomycin
  and 5% fetal bovine serum (Sigma-Aldrich).
- Cells were maintained at 37.0°C in a humidified atmosphere of 95.0% air and 5.0%
  CO2.
- Stock solution of PE (1 mg/mL) was prepared in ddH2O.
- Stock solution of Trolox (Sigma-Aldrich) (0.5 mM) was prepared by dissolving 6.26
  mg Trolox in 50 mL Na/K buffer and slightly warming the solution further (30°C in
  water bath).
- Three hundred micromolar working stock solution of NAC (Sigma-Aldrich) was prepared
  by serial dilution from a 30 mM stock in ddH2O.
- These stock solutions were then used to prepare various concentrations of drug-supplemented
  treatment media.
- MCF-7 cells were initially plated at a density of 2 × 104 cells/well (3 wells/group)
  in a volume of 1 mL/well of culture medium in 24-well plates.
- Cells were allowed to adhere for 24 h. The following day, cells were divided into
  different treatment groups.
- Media was removed and replaced with fresh control or treatment media.
- Cells were treated with increasing doses of PE (0-100 µg/mL), NAC (0-40 µg/mL),
  or Trolox (0-75 µg/mL) for a period of 72 or 96 h. For 96 h treatments, cells in
  their respective treatment groups were fed fresh control or treatment media after
  48 h. For 72 h treatments groups, control or treatment media were not changed.
- 'To assess the sustainability of growth inhibition cells were treated with 50 µg/mL
  of PE for 72 h followed by cell culturing in PE-free medium for additional 96 h.




  The determination of cell viability was first tested by MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl
  tetrazolium bromide) assay.'
- However, polyphenols have been shown to interfere with the redox chemistry of MTT
  assay system leading to false positive responses [17].
- Consistent with these observations, PE itself was found to generate colorimetric
  responses in the absence of cells, possibly due to interference with PE polyphenols.
- Hence, the effects of PE on MCF-7 cells were assessed by two alternative independent
  cell viability assays, crystal violet assay and acid phosphatase assay.
- Crystal violet assay gives quantitative information about the relative density of
  adhering cells [18], whereas acid phosphatase assay measures viable cell numbers
  by quantification of cytosolic acid phosphatase activity [19].
- In crystal violet assays, culture medium was removed from each well at the end of
  treatment period and cells were washed with 500 µL PBS.
- Cells were fixed with 0.1% glutaraldehyde (Fisher Scientific) in PBS for 20 min
  followed by staining with 0.1% crystal violet for 30 min.
- The crystal violet stain (Sigma-Aldrich) was solubilized in 1% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich)
  in ddH2O for 30 min and the absorbance was read with Victor3V 1420 Multi-Label Counter
  (PerkinElmer, Inc., Waltham, MA) at 590 nm.
- Three independent biological replicates were analyzed each in triplicate.
- In acid phosphatase assays, the culture medium was removed at the end of the treatment
  period and each well was washed once with 200 µL PBS.
- Buffer containing 0.1 M sodium acetate (pH 5.0), 0.1% Triton X-100 and 5 mM _p_-nitrophenyl
  phosphate (Sigma-Aldrich) was added and plates were incubated at 37.0°C for 2 h.
  The reaction was stopped with the addition of 100 µL of 1 N NaOH.
- The absorbance was read with Victor3V 1420 Multi-Label Counter (PerkinElmer, Inc.)
  at 405 nm.
- Three independent biological replicates were analyzed each in triplicate.
- Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) assay measures antioxidant strength
  based on Trolox (6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchroman-2-carboxylic acid) (Sigma-Aldrich)
  antioxidant capacity and is measured in units called Trolox equivalents (TEs).
- Trolox is a hydrophilic vitamin E analog that lacks the phytyl tail and has enhanced
  antioxidant capacity due to its increased cell permeability.
- Due to the difficulties in measuring individual antioxidant components of a complex
  mixture, Trolox equivalency is used as a benchmark for the antioxidant capacity
  of such a mixture [20].
- The TEAC assay is based on the suppression of the absorbance of radical cations
  of 2,2′-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline 6-sulfonate) (ABTS) (Sigma-Aldrich) by antioxidants
  in the test sample when ABTS incubates with a peroxidase (metmyoglobin) and H2O2.
- The assay was performed as previously described [21].
- Briefly, ABTS radical cations were prepared by adding 80 mg of manganese dioxide
  to 20 mL of 5 mM aqueous stock solution of ABTS in 75 mM Na/K buffer, pH 7.
- Trolox was used as an antioxidant standard.
- A standard calibration curve was constructed for Trolox at 0, 50, 100, 150, 200,
  250, and 300 µM concentrations.
- Samples of PE and NAC were serially diluted in Na/K buffer, added in triplicates
  in a 96-well plate and mixed with 200 µL of ABTS+ radical cation solution.
- Absorbance was read at 750 nm after 5 min in a Labsystems Multiscan MCC/340 microplate
  reader (Fisher Scientific).
- TEAC values were calculated from the Trolox standard curve and expressed as TEs
  (mM).
- Based on the assay results, doses of PE, Trolox and NAC that were equivalent in
  terms of TEs were used to treat MCF-7 cells to assess the comparative growth inhibition
  at 72 h. Three independent biological replicates were analyzed each in triplicate.
- For flow cytometry studies, MCF-7 cells were initially plated at a density of 2
  × 104 cells/well in triplicates in a volume of 1 mL/well of culture medium in 24-well
  plates.
- Cells were allowed to adhere for 24 h. The following day, media was removed and
  replaced with PE-supplemented or PE-free medium.
- At the end of 24, 48, and 72 h incubation, cells were harvested by trypsinization,
  3 wells were pooled together and prepared for flow cytometric analysis of Apo-BrDU
  and PI staining as per the protocol (Phoenix Flow Systems, San Diego, CA).
- Following trypsinization, cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 30 min
  on ice followed by 70% ethanol permeabilization overnight at −20°C.
- Samples were enzymatically labeled with bromodeoxyuridine triphosphate (BrdU) in
  TdT reaction buffer (2.5 mM cobalt chloride and 24 000 U terminal transferase) for
  1 h at 37°C to label the 3′-OH ends of fragmented DNA (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis,
  IN).
- DNA strand breaks were counterlabeled with FITC-conjugated anti-BrdU monoclonal
  antibody according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Phoenix Flow Systems).
- Cells were counterstained with 5 µg/mL propidium iodide (Sigma-Aldrich) in the presence
  of 0.015 U/mL RNase (Roche Applied Science) in PBS for 30 min at room temperature.
- Samples were analyzed on BD™ LSR II Flow Cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA)
  within 1 h of labeling and a minimum of 10 000 events were analyzed for each experimental
  condition.
- Three independent biological replicates for each treatment group were analyzed.
- Cells were propagated in 4-well Lab-Tek®II Chamber slides™ (NUNC A/S, Roskilde,
  Denmark) and treated with different doses of PE.
- At the end of each treatment period, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde,
  semi-permeabilized with 0.5% Triton-X 100 and washed with PBS as previously described
  [22].
- Briefly, cells were incubated with 1:400 dilution of mouse monoclonal antibody to
  γ-H2AX (phosphorylated histone 2AX) (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA), followed by
  1:200 dilution of goat antimouse antibody to immunoglobulin labeled with fluorescein
  isothiocyanate (FITC) (Jackson Immunochemicals, West Grove, PA) in PBS containing
  10% FBS for 1.5 and 1 h, respectively, and mounted with Vectashield with 4′,6′-diamino-2-phenylindol
  (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA).
- Cells were visualized at 100× using Nikon Eclipse TS100 microscope and analyzed
  for distinct nuclear foci.
- DAPI (1 µg/mL) in the mounting media was used as a counterstain.
- At least 100 cells were counted and cells with more than four distinct foci in the
  nucleus were considered positive for γ-H2AX.
- Three independent biological replicates were analyzed.
- Total RNA was extracted by Trizol method according to the manufacturer instructions
  (Life Technologies, Ambion, Carlsbad, CA) from cells treated with 50 µg/mL of PE
  for 72 h and their respective controls, collected from three independent biological
  replicates at three different passage numbers.
- The quality of the RNA samples was assessed by NanoDrop 1000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo
  Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and samples having 260/280 ratio ≈2.0 and 260/230
  ratio ≈2.0 were selected.
- RNA integrity number (RIN) was measured for the treatment and control samples using
  Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) and good quality samples (RIN
  &gt; 8) were further processed for hybridization into whole human genome Affymetrix
  Human Gene-1.0 ST array platform at the Center for Functional Genomics (Rensselaer,
  NY).
- All data were baseline transformed to the median of the control data.
- The data were filed to remove probesets with expression levels in the bottom 20th
  percentile across all samples.
- The entities were further processed through 1.5-fold filter settings to include
  those entities that were differentially expressed between PE treatments and controls.
- Differentially expressed entities were then passed to a _t_-test (_P_ &lt; 0.05)
  with a Benjamini-Hochberg False discovery rate correction to obtain the statistically
  significant and differentially expressed genes.
- DAVID functional annotation analysis was performed to highlight the most relevant
  gene ontology (GO)-term enrichment associated within the gene list.
- The downregulated/upregulated gene entities were then filtered by the default settings
  of EASE score threshold (Max.
- Prob ≤ 0.1 and Min.
- Count ≥ 2) to calculate the Fisher exact _P_-value for gene enrichment analysis
  (smaller the _P_-value, the stronger the enrichment in annotation categories).
- In addition, we performed Ingenuity Pathway Analysis to identify molecular relationships
  among the genes that were differentially expressed in both microarrays and qRT-PCR.
- Validation of the microarray data of selected genes was performed in MCF-7 cells
  treated with 50 µg/mL of PE for 24, 48, and 72 h on samples from biological experiments
  independent from those used for microarray analysis.
- Total RNA was isolated using Trizol and purified using NucleoSpin kit (Qiagen, Germantown,
  MD).
- The purity of the RNA was assessed by NanoDrop 1000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher
  Scientific).
- cDNA was synthesized from 1 µg of total RNA using Multiscribe reverse transcriptase
  enzyme (Applied Biosciences, Foster City, CA) and qRT-PCR was performed using SYBR
  green (Applied Biosciences) assays in ABI7900 real-time PCR system.
- GAPDH was used as housekeeping gene for normalizations.
- Relative quantification of expression was calculated using the 2−ΔΔCT method [23].
- Three independent biological replicates were analyzed in duplicate.
- All primers were subjected to a quality control to assure that each primer set (forward
  and reverse) generates a specific PCR product.
- Primer information is provided in Supplementary Table 1.
- Three different bioinformatics algorithms, miRanda, TargetScan, and PicTar, were
  used to identify miRNAs predicted to target a set of genes that were significantly
  downregulated by PE (Suppl.
- Table 2).
- The application of a single miRNA target prediction program results in high levels
  of false positive and false negative discovery rates [24].
- However, a combination of two or more programs increases the rate of known target
  prediction up to 72.6% or 100% for evolutionary conserved targets [24].
- The miRanda program predicts miRNA targets by taking into consideration maximum
  weightage of sequence complementarity to the bases comprising of seed region [25,
  26].
- It also calculates hybridization energy between miRNA-mRNA using RNAFold.
- The TargetScan program finds the simple 7-nucleotide perfect seed sequence match
  between the mRNA target region and 5′ end of miRNA [27].
- TargetScan further extends the sequence match by allowing G:U wobble pairing and
  uses hybridization energy (RNAFold) to calculate thermodynamic free energy for binding
  the remaining base pairing portion.
- The PicTar program matches perfect 7-mer starting at position 1 or 2 at the 5′ end
  of the miRNA calculates hybridization energy and discards unstable duplexes [28].
- Total RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent according to the manufacturer's recommendations
  (Life Technologies, Ambion).
- The total RNA preparations that include miRNAs were analyzed for purity using NanoDrop
  1000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
- miRNA cDNA was synthesized from 1 µg of purified total RNA using qScript miRNA cDNA
  synthesis kit (Quanta Biosciences, Gaithersburg, MD) and qRT-PCR was performed in
  20 µL reaction volume containing 4 µL template cDNA and 16 µL of reaction mix containing
  PerfeCTa SYBR green master mix, 10 µM PerfeCTa Universal PCR primer and 10 µM PerfeCTa
  miRNA assay primer in ABI7900 real-time PCR system.
- The samples were initially heated at 95°C for 2 min followed by 40 cycles of 95°C
  for 5 s and 60°C for 30 s. The results were normalized to RNU6B expression and quantified
  using 2−ΔΔCT method.
- Three independent biological replicates were analyzed in duplicate.
- Primer information is provided in Supplementary Table 3.
- Results were expressed as a mean ± standard error of the mean.
- Two-way ANOVA was used to estimate the overall significance using Student's _t_-test,
  _P_ values below 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
- The effects of various doses of PE treatment on MCF-7 cell growth are shown in Figure
  1.
- Treatment with 0-100 µg/mL of PE significantly inhibited MCF-7 cell growth in a
  dose- and time-dependent manner as measured by acid phosphatase assay (Figure 1A)
  and crystal violet assay (Figure 1B).
- Both assay measurements showed similar effects at all the doses and time points.
- A dose of 20 µg/mL inhibited cell growth by approximately 30% and 35% at 72 and
  96 h, respectively, whereas 50 µg/mL of PE inhibited cell growth by about 50% and
  80% at 72 and 96 h, respectively, compared to untreated controls.
- Cell numbers remained similar throughout the treatment period at an exposure dose
  of 50 µg/mL, indicating the significant inhibition of cell growth.
- Given that PE is standardized to ∼40% punicalagin and 3.4% free ellagic acid, 50
  µg/mL of PE is equivalent to ∼18.44 µM punicalagin and ∼5.62 µM free ellagic acid,
  whereas the relative proportions of other ellagitannins are unknown.
- Figure 1\.
- Treatment effects on MCF-7 cell growth.
- Effect of PE treatment assessed by (A) acid phosphatase assay and (B) crystal violet
  assay.
- (C) Effect of PE pretreatment.
- Cells were pretreated with 50 µg/mL of PE for 72 h followed by incubation in PE-free
  growth medium.
- Cell growth was assessed by acid phosphatase assay.
- (D) Effect of PE, NAC, and Trolox.
- Solid black, hatched, and gray triplet bars represent doses of PE (P), NAC (N),
  and Trolox (T) equivalent in terms of TEs.
- Cell growth was assessed by acid phosphatase assay after 72 h of treatment.
- _P_ &lt; 0.05, compared to control or equivalent dose of NAC or Trolox.
- We also examined the effect of PE pretreatment.
- Cells maintained in PE-free medium after PE pretreatment showed about threefold
  reduction or 48 h delay in cell growth in comparison to their respective controls
  (Figure 1C).
- This suggested that PE-gene interactions established during treatment were responsible
  for the sustained growth arrest.
- We determined whether cell growth inhibition by PE is due to its antioxidant actions.
- We used TEAC assay to compare antioxidant capacity of PE, NAC, and Trolox in terms
  of TEs.
- For example, antioxidant capacity of 50 µg/mL of PE was found to be equivalent to
  40 µg/mL (220 µM) of NAC and 75 µg/mL (280 µM) of Trolox.
- Growth inhibition of equivalent doses of PE, NAC, and Trolox is shown in Figure
  1D.
- In agreement with the results in Figure 1A, PE inhibited cell growth in a dose-dependent
  manner.
- However, NAC or Trolox at doses containing equivalent antioxidant capacity as PE
  did not inhibit cell growth.
- This indicated that the growth-inhibitory action of PE cannot solely be attributed
  to its antioxidant capacity.
- NAC is known to inhibit cancer cell growth but at concentrations that are three
  orders of magnitude higher (tens of mM) than used in our study [29-31] while cytostatic
  doses of Trolox have not been established.
- Consistent with the cell viability assay results flow cytometric analysis showed
  continuous cell growth inhibition with 50 µg/mL of PE throughout the 72 h treatment
  period.
- Figure 2 shows flow cytometry results for 0 and 50 µg/mL of PE treatment for 48
  h. PE treated cells accumulated in G2 phase possibly due to G2/M cell cycle arrest
  and also underwent apoptosis (Figure 2).
- The degree of cell cycle inhibition was similar at 24 and 72 h (data not shown).
- These results indicate that interference with cell cycle regulation pathways may
  be one of the mechanisms of cell growth inhibition by PE.
- Figure 2\.
- Flow cytometric analysis of PE treatment in MCF-7 cells.
- (A) Scatter plots of flow cytometric analysis.
- Live cells are shown in bottom right quadrant (Q3) and apoptotic cells are shown
  in upper right quadrant (Q2).
- Numbers at the corner of Q2 indicates the percentage of apoptotic cells.
- (B) Cell cycle phase distribution.
- One representative experiment of three is shown.
- A total of 903 differentially expressed gene entities (1.5-fold cutoff, _P_ &lt;
  0.05) were identified in cells treated with 50 µg/mL of PE for 72 h, where 398 genes
  were downregulated and 505 genes were upregulated (Figure 3).
- DAVID functional annotation analysis, performed to highlight the most relevant GO-term
  enrichment, showed 134 enriched terms associated with downregulated genes and 264
  enriched terms associated with upregulated genes.
- Top over-represented cellular processes sorted by Score, −log(_P_-value), are shown
  in Figure 3B and C. Twenty-four differentially expressed genes (13 downregulated
  and 11 upregulated) were selected for qRT-PCR validation based on genes classified
  for cancer-related enriched GO-terms (mitosis, DNA replication, DNA repair, chromosomal
  organization, chromosomal segregation, regulation of apoptosis, regulation of cell
  proliferation) and those that displayed the greatest extreme in differential expression
  (independent of the GO-term, based on lowest _P_-values).
- The differential gene expression of most of these genes was confirmed by qRT-PCR
  (Figure 4).
- We focused on cellular processes that may explain growth inhibitory and proapoptotic
  effects of PE, such as DNA damage response, DNA repair and cell cycle control.
- DNA damage response and repair genes including _MRE11_, _RAD50_, _NBS1_, _RAD51_,
  _BRCA1_, _BRCA2_, _BRCC3_, and _MSH6_ that were downregulated in microarrays, showed
  a reduction in mRNA levels over a period of 72 h, where the greatest reduction was
  observed at 72 h (Figure 4A).
- The importance of these genes is underscored by the fact that the proteins encoded
  by _RAD50_, _NBS_, and _MRE11_ form the MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 (MRN) complex, which acts
  as double strand break (DSB) sensor, maintains genome stability during replication,
  promotes homologous recombination (HR) repair, activates ATM for recruitment to
  damaged DNA and is essential for cell viability [32].
- RAD51 is a central player in most HR repair events [33].
- BRCA1 has a pleotropic function in DNA damage signaling and repair [34].
- Importantly, most of downregulated DNA repair genes including _MRE11_, _RAD50_,
  _NBS1_, _RAD51_, _BRCA1_, _BRCA2_, and _BRCC3_ are involved HR-mediated repair,
  suggesting that PE specifically targets HR and thereby sensitizes cells to DSBs,
  cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.

- Relative fold-change was determined by qRT-PCR, _P_ &lt; 0.05, _P_ &lt; 0.01, _P_
  &lt; 0.001, compared to respective control.
- Figure 4B shows qRT-PCR validation of the genes that play a role in cell cycle control
  in addition to other processes and include _MCM6_, _SLK_, _PLK1_, _GADD45A_, _CDKN1A_,
  _E2F2_, and _CCNA2_.
- All the genes with the exception of p53 downstream targets _GADD45A_ (growth arrest
  and DNA-damage-inducible) and _CDKN1A_ (p21) exhibited the pattern observed in microarrays.
- _GADD45A_ and _CDKN1A_ were found to be upregulated in microarrays (by threefold)
  but did not show significant upregulation in qRT-PCR after 24, 48, and/or 72 h suggesting
  that the PE-induced cell cycle arrest is independent of GADD45A and CDKN1A and perhaps
  p53.
- In addition, we performed qRT-PCR for some of the known PE targets, such as JNK-2,
  AKT, and PI3K genes (Figure 4C), which did not appear to be significantly altered
  in our microarray analysis, but were indicated as potential upstream players of
  DNA repair and cell cycle control by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA).
- The observed fold-change reduction in mRNA levels of these genes is consistent with
  the reduction in their protein levels and/or activity reported in other studies
  [35, 36].
- IPA identified a highly significant network associated with DNA repair and M-phase
  GO-terms.
- The network involves the genes that were differentially expressed by PE treatment
  and thus provides a valuable model for understanding the complex mechanism of PE
  mediated growth inhibition (Figure 5).
- Figure 5\.
- Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of significantly downregulated genes after PE treatment.
- Interactions between cell cycle control and DNA repair genes and possible upstream
  regulators are shown.
- Because PE downregulated important DSB response and repair genes, we determined
  the frequency of DSBs by immunofluorescence of γ-H2AX (Figure 6A).
- γ-H2AX foci form rapidly after DSB formation and resolve following repair and thus
  represent a sensitive measure of DSB formation and repair [37].
- PE treatment resulted in an elevated frequency of γ-H2AX foci with the highest increase
  (∼2-fold) at 72 h (Figure 6B).

- Binding of short noncoding RNA, miRNA, to the target mRNA can lead to mRNA degradation
  or translational repression.
- Dietary compounds were shown to modify miRNAs involved in a variety of biological
  processes but whether PE can regulate miRNAs involved in DNA repair is unknown [38].
- We used three different bioinformatics algorithms, miRanda, TargetScan, and PicTar,
  to identify miRNAs predicted to target the mRNA of _MRE11A_, _RAD50_, _NBS1_, _RAD51_,
  _BRCA1_, and _BRCA2_ genes (Suppl.
- Table 2) and performed qRT-PCR on miRNAs that were common in two or three algorithms
  and showed the highest prediction score.
- Screening for common miRNAs in two or more bioinformatics programs increases the
  rate of known target prediction to 72.6% and up to 100% for evolutionary conserved
  targets [24].
- Comparative analysis predicted miR-183 to have a seed binding site in the 3′Untranlated
  Region (3′UTR) of _RAD50_ (predicted by all three algorithms) and miR-132 to have
  seed binding sites in the 3′UTR of _BRCA1_ (predicted by two of three algorithms).
- The 3′UTR of _RAD50_ contains only a single seed binding site for miR-183 that is
  conserved across ten vertebrate species (TargetScan PCT score 0.37), which strongly
  increases the probability that _RAD50_ is a target of miR-183.
- We also chose to examine miR-24, which has seedless binding sites in the 3′UTR of
  genes downregulated in our microarray including _BRCA1_, _E2F2_, and _CCNA2_.
- Importantly, _BRCA1_, _E2F2_, and _CCNA2_ genes have been validated experimentally
  by luciferase assay as being direct targets of miR-24 [39].
- PE treatment resulted in a significant upregulation of miR-183 and miR-24 but not
  miR-132 (Figure 7).
- Increased miR-183 levels correlated inversely with mRNA levels of _RAD50_ (refer
  to Figure 4A) suggesting a possible communication between miR-183 and _RAD50_.
- Similarly, there was an inverse correlation between miR-24 and mRNA levels of _BRCA1_,
  _E2F2_, and _CCNA2_ (Figure 4A and B).
- In summary, these data are suggestive that PE may upregulate miRNAs involved in
  DNA repair and cell cycle control but further experimentation is needed.

- Changes in miRNA expression levels after PE treatment.
- Relative fold-change was determined by qRT-PCR, _P_ &lt; 0.05, compared to respective
  control.
- miR-24 targets _BRCA1_, _E2F2_, and _CCNA2_, miR-183 is predicted to target _RAD50_
  and miR-132 is predicted to target _BRCA1_.
- The observations in the present study demonstrate cellular and molecular actions
  of PE beyond antioxidation in MCF-7 cells including evidence of downregulation of
  DNA repair.
- While earlier studies have reported growth inhibitory, proapoptotic, and antiinvasive
  properties of PE in different cancer cell lines [4, 5, 7, 9, 12], this is the first
  study to demonstrate that PE may affect DNA repair pathway required for the survival
  of cancer cells.
- Consistent with earlier reports, our study confirmed that PE treatment inhibited
  cancer cell growth in a dose- and time-dependent manner, as assessed by two independent
  cell growth and viability assays.
- Growth inhibition was associated with the G2/M cell cycle arrest and the induction
  of apoptosis.
- Secondly, PE pretreatment significantly delayed cell growth.
- This finding may be of clinical relevance and suggests that intermittent exposure
  to PE dietary supplements might be effective without compromising anticancer activities,
  which may be deemed as a more feasible dietary approach.
- Thirdly, comparative growth inhibition assessment of PE, NAC, and Trolox suggests
  that the growth inhibition by PE is not solely attributed to its high antioxidant
  potential.
- This was a strong rationale for investigation of other possible mechanisms of action,
  for which we employed Affymetrix microarrays.
- Microarray analysis showed that PE treatment significantly modulated over 900 genes.
- The most enriched GO-terms among downregulated genes included mitosis, chromosomal
  organization, RNA processing, DNA replication, DNA damage response, and DNA repair,
  whereas the most enriched GO-terms among upregulated genes included regulation of
  apoptosis and regulation of cell proliferation.
- Although many of these cellular processes may control cell growth and death, this
  study links for the first time PE exposure and downregulation of DNA repair genes.
- Of particular interest, most of the DNA repair genes that were downregulated by
  PE are involved in HR-mediated repair [33, 40, 41].
- For example, the MRN complex together with CtIP facilitates 5′-3′ resection of DSB
  ends required for initiation of HR.
- BRCA1 interacts with both MRN and CtIP and may be involved in end resection, although
  BRCA1 has pleiotropic functions and its exact role in HR is difficult to dissect.
- On the contrary, BRCA2 is predominantly involved in HR.
- The 3′-single-stranded DNA overhang generated during end resection is bound to replication
  protein A (RPA), which is required for subsequent recruitment of RAD51.
- BRCA2 displaces RPA and facilitates loading of RAD51 onto single-stranded DNA.
- RAD51 forms the nucleoprotein filament that catalyzes strand exchange during which
  single-stranded DNA invades homologous duplex DNA forming a displacement loop (D-loop),
  required for subsequent HR reactions.
- BRCA2 binds RAD51 through interactions with a series of eight short conserved repeats
  stimulating nucleoprotein filament formation.
- Also, BRCA2 itself binds to single-stranded DNA.
- Both BRCA1 and BRCA2 deficient cells are defective for HR.
- The role of BRCC3 in HR is uncertain.
- However, it directly interacts with BRCA1 and is required for ionizing radiation-induced
  BRCA1 phosphorylation and nuclear foci formation [42].
- Importantly, BRCC3 is aberrantly expressed in the majority of breast cancer cell
  lines and in invasive ductal carcinomas, suggesting a potential role in breast cancer
  [43].
- MSH6, a mismatch repair protein, has also been linked to HR.
- MSH6 has been shown to co-localize with BLM, p53, and RAD51 in hydroxyurea-induced
  RAD51 nuclear foci that may correspond to the sites of presumed stalled DNA replication
  forks, which are subject to HR repair [44].
- Altogether, this illustrates that PE may influence multiple steps of the HR reaction.
- HR pathway is only active during the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle since the
  sister chromatid, a preferential substrate for HR, is present only after DNA replication
  [33, 40, 45].
- It is possible that HR could use homologous chromosomes for DSB repair in the G1
  phase but this would result in genome rearrangements.
- To avert this scenario, HR is controlled not only by DNA damage response signaling
  pathways but also cell cycle regulators as well as chromatin remodeling factors
  [45].
- In our study, PE-treated cells were arrested in G2/M, which provides a time and
  substrate for HR to occur.
- However, we also found that important chromatin remodeling genes (RUVBL1/Tip49,
  RSF1, and RNF20) were downregulated by PE.
- As noted above, HR occurs predominantly in replicating cells, while an alternative
  DSB repair pathway, nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ), prevails in quiescent and
  postmitotic cells.
- Thus, it is reasonable to assume that HR is essential for the maintenance and viability
  of cancer cells but not normal quiescent cells.
- To support this notion, a study using _Rad50_ conditional knock-out mice showed
  that depletion of Rad50 in cultured cells caused extensive DNA damage and death
  within 3-5 d. On the contrary, Rad50 was dispensable for viability of quiescent
  and postmitotic tissues [46].
- These findings support the idea that HR is not essential in nondividing cells.
- In agreement with this, HR was found to be spontaneously increased in breast cancer
  cells while NHEJ was not, as shown by plasmid reporter assays measuring DSB repair
  by HR and/or NHEJ [47].
- In addition to DSB repair, HR also repairs stalled and collapsed replication forks
  (i.e., replication-associated lesions).
- There is experimental evidence suggesting that DSBs are not the primary substrate
  for HR in mitotic cells, whereas most spontaneous HR in mitotic cells is induced
  by stalled replication forks [45].
- Both unrepaired DSBs and replication-associated lesions will ultimately culminate
  in cell death.
- Our findings that PE downregulated the MRN complex subunits, _MRE11_, _RAD50_, _NBS1_,
  and _RAD51_, _BRCA1_, _BRCA2_, _BRCC3_, and _MSH6_, and increased DSBs, suggest
  that these may be the possible causes for reduced cancer cell survival following
  PE treatment.
- The mechanism of downregulation of DNA repair genes by PE is currently unclear.
- Our study suggests that miRNAs may be among the possible regulators.
- We found that PE treatment upregulated miR-183 and miR-24 that are predicted to
  target RAD50 and BRCA1, respectively.
- Experimental validation will confirm whether RAD50 is a direct target of miR-183,
  while BRCA1 has already been validated as miR-24 target [29].
- In addition to spontaneous damage, HR is involved in the repair of DNA damage induced
  by cancer drugs [45, 48].
- Inhibition of HR amplifies toxic replication-associated DNA lesions that directly
  result in cell death.
- HR inhibitors are therefore predicted to be highly efficient at killing tumors.
- Some newly developed drugs that enhance tumor chemosensitivity and radiosensitivity
  were shown to target HR (i.e., imatinib, proteasome inhibitors, and histone deacetylase
  inhibitors) [45, 49].
- Also, downregulation of HR genes, _BRCA2_ and _RAD51_, by interference RNA approach
  sensitizes cancer cells to chemotherapeutics [50].
- Whether PE exclusively downregulates DNA repair genes in cancer cells is unknown.
- Irrespective of this, because the MRN complex is dispensable for the maintenance
  and viability of postmitotic tissues and HR is only active in replicating cells,
  it is likely that downregulation of HR in normal tissues would have only a minor
  effect, provided the NHEJ pathway is intact [46].
- Thus, our study showing that PE downregulates HR genes warrants further investigations
  regarding the use of PE as a nontoxic HR inhibitor available in the form of a whole
  fruit, fruit juice, or a dietary supplement pill.
- At present, it is unknown whether PE downregulates HR in vivo.
- Likewise, it is unclear whether equivalent concentrations of PE ellagitannins (i.e.,
  18.4 µM punicalagins and 5.6 µM ellagic acid) can be achieved in humans, compounded
  by the occurrence of different PE metabolites in cultured cells and human tissues.
- In humans, ellagitannins are hydrolyzed to ellagic acid and further converted by
  gut microflora to bioavailable urolithins [16, 51, 52].
- Ellagic acid and urolithins undergo conjugation with methyl, glucuronyl, and sulfate
  groups and are found in plasma and excreted in the urine [16, 51-53].
- Ellagitannin metabolism, which may be dependent on the intestinal flora or bowel
  transit time, shows considerable inter-individual variability [16, 51, 53].
- Punicalagin, which is the major ellagitannin present in pomegranate juice and occurs
  as isomers, was not detected in plasma or urine in humans after consumption of pomegranate
  juice [51].
- Ellagic acid, although poorly absorbed and rapidly metabolized, was detected in
  human plasma after consumption of a single dose of 8 ounces of pomegranate juice
  or 1000 mg of PE dietary supplement with a maximum concentration of 0.06 µM at 1
  h postingestion [16, 53].
- In contrast, Cerda et al.
- '[51] reported that ellagic acid was not detected in plasma or urine after daily
  intake of 1 L of pomegranate juice containing 4.37 g punicalagins over 5 d, but
  found three ellagitannin metabolites in plasma.'
- The highest concentration of the sum of the three metabolites reached 18.6 µM [51].
- Also, Seeram et al.
- '[16] detected increasing concentrations of glucuronyl and sulfate conjugates of
  urolithin A and urolithin B in plasma samples between 0.5 and 6 h postingestion,
  with the highest concentration of urolithin A and urolithin B of 0.11 and 0.05 µM,
  respectively.'
- In the current study, we used 50 µg/mL of PE that is equivalent to 18.4 µM of punicalagins.
- Because gut flora metabolites are not formed in cell culture, extrapolation of PE
  concentration in growth medium to human plasma is inaccurate per se.
- Yet, the fact that ellagitannin metabolites were measured at micromolar concentrations
  in human plasma after ingestion of pomegranate juice [51] suggests that PE concentration
  used in this study is a physiologically relevant dose.
- However, the use of only one cancer cell line is a limitation of this study, which
  will be addressed in future studies.
- In summary, our study suggests that PE targets a specific DNA repair pathway that
  is critical for cancer cell survival both spontaneously and after drug challenge.
- This provides a strong rationale for further testing of PE as a nontoxic adjunct
  to the prevention of breast cancer recurrence through its actions on breast cancer
  cells.
- However, further research is needed to demonstrate these effects in animal studies
  and in tissue samples from women with breast cancer.
