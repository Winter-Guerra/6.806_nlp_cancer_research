- In the present work, methanolic, ethanolic and boiled water extracts of _Suillus
  collinitus_ were chemically characterised and submitted to an evaluation of their
  bioactive properties (antioxidant potential and cytotoxic activity in tumor cell
  lines).
- Phenolic acids and sugars were identified chromatographically and quantified in
  the methanolic and boiled water extracts, respectively.
- _S.
- collinitus_ ethanolic extract had the highest antioxidant activity.
- Nevertheless, with respect to cell growth inhibition, the methanolic extract was
  the most potent extract, particularly in MCF-7 cells (GI50 25.2 ± 0.2 Î¼g/ml).
- Moreover, the GI50 concentration of this extract induced a G1 cell cycle arrest,
  with a concomitant decrease in the percentage of cells in the S phase.
- Furthermore, it caused an increase in the percentage of apoptotic cells, from 6.0
  ± 0.2% in untreated cells, to 15.3 ± 2.0% in cells treated with the GI50 concentration
  and to 16.3 ± 2.0% in cells treated with 2 × GI50 concentration.
- In addition, 48 h treatment with the GI50 concentration caused a strong increase
  in the levels of p53, p21, and cleaved PARP, together with a decrease in Bcl-2 and
  XIAP.
- Results indicate that _S.
- collinitus_ may be a promising source of bioactive compounds.
- Particularly, its methanolic extract appears to have a p53-mediated effect on the
  normal cell cycle distribution and apoptosis induction in a human breast tumor cell
  line.
