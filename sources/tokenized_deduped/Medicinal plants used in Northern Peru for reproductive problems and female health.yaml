- Infections of the reproductive tract, complications after childbirth, and reproductive
  problems continue to be a major health challenge worldwide.
- An impressive number of plant species is traditionally used to remedy such afflictions,
  and some have been investigated for their efficacy with positive results.
- A total of 105 plant species belonging to 91 genera and 62 families were documented
  and identified as herbal remedies for reproductive problems in Northern Peru.
- Most species used were Asteraceae (9.52%), followed by Lamiaceae and Fabaceae (8.57%
  and 6.67%).
- The most important families are clearly represented very similarly to their overall
  importance in the local pharmacopoeia.
- The majority of herbal preparations for reproductive afflictions were prepared from
  the leaves of plants (22.72%), the whole plant (21.97%), and stems (21.21%), while
  other plant parts were used less frequently.
- More than 60% of the cases fresh plant material was used to prepare remedies.
- Over 70% of the remedies were applied orally, while the remaining ones were applied
  topically.
- Many remedies were prepared as mixtures of multiple ingredients.
- Little scientific evidence exists to prove the efficacy of the species employed
  as reproductive disorder remedies in Northern Peru.
- Only 34% of the plants found or their congeners have been studied at all for their
  medicinal properties.
- The information gained on frequently used traditional remedies might give some leads
  for future targets for further analysis in order to develop new drugs.
- According to 1999 WHO estimates reproductive problems, including, 340 million new
  cases of curable Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STIs; syphilis, gonorrhoea, chlamydia
  and trichomoniasis) occur annually throughout the world in adults aged 15-49 years.
- In developing countries, STIs and their complications rank in the top five disease
  categories for which adults seek health care.
- Infection with STIs can lead to acute symptoms, chronic infection and serious delayed
  consequences such as infertility, ectopic pregnancy, cervical cancer and the untimely
  death of infants and adults [1].
- Traditional Medicine (TM) is used globally and is rapidly growing in economic importance.
- In developing countries, TM is often the only accessible and affordable treatment
  available.
- The WHO reports that TM is the primary health care system for 80% of the population
  in developing countries.
- In Latin America, the WHO Regional Office for the Americas (AMRO/PAHO) reports that
  71% of the population in Chile and 40% of the population in Colombia have used TM.
- The WHO indicates that in many Asian countries TM is widely used, even though Western
  medicine is often readily available, and in Japan, 60-70% of allopathic doctors
  prescribe TMs for their patients [2].
- Complementary Alternative Medicine (CAM) is gaining popularity in many developed
  countries.
- Forty-two percent of the population in the US have used CAM at least once [3], and
  the use of at least one of 16 alternative therapies increased from 34% in 1990 to
  42% in 1997 [4].
- The number of visits to providers of CAM now exceeds by far the number of visits
  to all primary care physicians in the US [5,6].
- The expenses for the use of TM and CAM are exponentially growing in many parts of
  the world.
- The 1997 out-of-pocket CAM expenditure was estimated at US$ 2,7 billion in the USA,
  and the world market for herbal medicines based on traditional knowledge is now
  estimated at US$ 60 billion [7].
- Northern Peru is believed to be the center of the Central Andean Health Axis [8],
  and traditional medicinal practices in this region remain an important component
  of everyday life [9-13].
- TM is also gaining acceptance by national governments and health providers.
- Peru's National Program in Complementary Medicine and the Pan American Health Organization
  recently compared Complementary Medicine to allopathic medicine in clinics and hospitals
  operating within the Peruvian Social Security System.
- The results showed that the cost of using Traditional Medicine was less than the
  cost of Western therapy.
- In addition, for each of the criteria evaluated -- clinical efficacy, user satisfaction,
  and future risk reduction -- Traditional Medicine 's efficacy was higher than that
  of conventional treatments, including fewer side effects, higher perception of efficacy
  by both the patients and the clinics, and a 53-63% higher cost efficiency of Traditional
  Medicine over that of conventional treatments for the selected conditions [14].
- According to [6], the sustainable cultivation and harvesting of medicinal species
  is one of the most important challenges for the next few years.
- The present study attempts to give an overview on medicinal plant species employed
  in Northern Peru in traditional remedies for reproductive problems and female health,
  and compare this use to the western scientific evidence regarding their efficacy.
- Plants for the present study were collected in the field, in markets, and at the
  homes of traditional healers (_curanderos_) in Northern Peru in 10 2-3 months long
  field visits between 2001 and 2009, as a larger scale project following initial
  collections in southern Ecuador (Figure 1).
- The same 116 informants (healers and market vendors) in the Trujillo and Chiclayo
  area were repeatedly interviewed during this time, using structured questionnaires.
- The informants were always provided with fresh (non-dried) plant material, either
  collected with them, by them, or available at their market stands.
- The questionnaires did not include any reference as to disease concepts, plant parts
  or preparations.
- In contrast, the participants were asked simple questions along the lines "What
  is this plant used for, which part, which quantity, how is it prepared, are any
  other plants added to the mixture."
- All questions were asked in the same order.
- All informants were of Mestizo origin, and spoke only Spanish as their native language,
  and all interviews were conducted in Spanish.
- The study covered the four existing medicinal plant markets of the region, and included
  all vendors present.
- All interviews were conducted with the same set of participants.
- The specimens are registered under the collection series "RBU/PL," "ISA," "GER,"
  "JULS," "EHCHL," "VFCHL," "TRUBH," and "TRUVANERICA," depending on the year of fieldwork
  and collection location.
- Surveys were conducted in Spanish by fluent speakers.
- Surveyors would approach healers, collectors and market vendors and explain the
  premise for the study, including the goal of conservation of medicinal plants in
  the area.
- Vouchers of all specimens were deposited at the Herbario Truxillensis (HUT, Universidad
  Nacional de Trujillo), and Herbario Antenor Orrego (HAO, Universidad Privada Antenor
  Orrego Trujillo).
- In order to recognize Peru's rights under the Convention on Biological Diversity,
  most notably with regard to the conservation of genetic resources in the framework
  of a study treating medicinal plants, the identification of the plant material was
  conducted entirely in Peru.
- No plant material collected either in this study in Northern Peru, or the previous
  study in Southern Ecuador was exported in any form whatsoever.
- The nomenclature of plant families, genera, and species follows the _Catalogue of
  the Flowering Plants and Gymnosperms of Peru _[15] and the _Catalogue of Vascular
  Plants of Ecuador _[16].
- The nomenclature was compared to the TROPICOS database.
- Species were identified using the available volumes of the _Flora of Peru _[17],
  as well as [18-20], and the available volumes of the _Flora of Ecuador _[21].
- A total of 105 plant species belonging to 91 genera and 62 families were documented
  and identified as herbal remedies for reproductive problems in Northern Peru.
- Most species used were Asteraceae (9.52%), followed by Lamiaceae and Fabaceae (8.57%
  and 6.67%).
- Other families were less important, and 44 contributed only one species each to
  the pharmacopoeia (Table 1).
- The most important families are clearly represented very similarly to their overall
  importance in the local pharmacopoeia (Table 1) [9].
- Table 1.
- "Plants used for reproductive issues in Northern Peru and Comparison of reproductive
  treatments to the ten most important plant families of the medicinal flora of Northern
  Peru (after Bussmann &amp; Sharon 2006) \n\nThe majority of herbal preparations
  for reproductive issues were prepared from the leaves of plants (22.72%), the whole
  plant (21.97%), and stems (21.21%), while other plant parts were used much less
  frequently (Table 2)."
- This indicates that the local healers count on a very well developed knowledge about
  the properties of different plant parts.
- In almost 62% of the cases fresh plant material was used to prepare remedies, which
  differs little from the average herbal preparation mode in Northern Peru.
- Over 70% of the remedies were applied orally, while the remaining ones were applied
  topically.
- Many remedies were prepared as mixtures of multiple ingredients by boiling plant
  material either in water or in sugarcane spirit.
- Table 3.
- "Species encountered and used in Northern Peru for reproductive problems \n\n\n\nLittle
  scientific evidence exists to prove the efficacy of the species employed as reproductive
  disorder remedies in Northern Peru."
- Only 34% of the plants found or their congeners have been studied at all for their
  medicinal properties.
- _Aloe _spp.
- are known to have oestrogenic activity [22,23].
- '[24] reported that _Artemisia _spp.'
- had effects on female health amongst the Cumash.
- 'A variety of other Asteraceae has been shown to be used against menopausal symptoms
  (_Clibadium_: [25]; _Matricaria_: [26-28]; _Taraxacum_: [29,30].'
- '[23] found hormonal effects in _Cordia _sp., while [31-35] reported on anti-fertility
  effects of _Dioscorea _sp.'
- _Cupressus _sp.
- are well known abortifacients (e.g.
- '[36]), while pumpkin seed oil showed testosterone-inhibitory effects (e.g.'
- '[23,37-39]).'
- _Chamaesyce _sp.
- showed promise in the treatment of male infertility, while _Mimosa _sp.
- on the contrary are used to reduce spermal fertility [23,40].
- A wide range of Lamiaceae have been shown to exhibit contraceptive efficacy, and
  the same species are used in Peru for similar purposes (_Mentha _spp.
- ': [41-44]; _Ocimum _spp.'
- ': [45-48]; _Origanum majorana_: [44,49,50]; _Rosmarinus officinalis_: [40]).'
- Similar efficacy has been shown for _Sanguisorba officinalis _[51], and _Ruta graveolens
  _[23,52-55].
- Various species of _Passiflora _have aphrodisiac activity [56-60], and _Myristica
  fragrans _as well as _Syzygium aromaticum _[61,62], and extracts of _Lantana camara
  _[63,64] and _Pilea _spp.
- '[23] fulfil the same purpose, while _Portulaca oleracea _showed efficacy in relieving
  uterine bleeding [65,66].'
- Infections of the reproductive tract, complications after childbirth, and reproductive
  problems continue to be a major health challenge worldwide.
- An impressive number of plant species is traditionally used to remedy such afflictions,
  and some have been investigated for their efficacy with positive results.
- An often-limiting factor to these investigations is lack of comprehensive ethnobotanical
  data to help choose plant candidates for potency/efficacy tests.
- Since the plant parts utilized in preparation of the remedies are reported in this
  survey, it serves as an indication of species that may need further ecological assessment
  on their regeneration status.
- The results of this study show that both indigenous and introduced species are used
  for the treatment of reproductive system problems.
- The information gained on frequently used traditional remedies might give some leads
  for future targets for further analysis in order to develop new drugs.
- However, more detailed scientific studies are desperately needed to evaluate the
  efficacy and safety of the remedies employed traditionally.
- RB collected/identified plant material analysis of the data as well as writing the
  manuscript.
- AG conducted fieldwork, data analysis and manuscript composition.
- "Both authors have read and approved the final manuscript \n\n\n\nThe presented
  study was financed through MIRT/MHIRT (Minority Health Disparity International Research
  and Training) a grant from the National Institutes of Health (Fund: 54112B MHIRT
  Program, Grant: G0000613)."
- Fieldwork for this project was supported through the assistance of a large number
  of MIRT/MHIRT students and volunteers.
- Thanks to all of them.
- None of the work would have been possible without the invaluable collaboration of
  Douglas Sharon and our Peruvian colleagues, especially _curanderas _Julia Calderón,
  Isabel Chinguel, and Olinda Pintado, _curanderos _Germán Santisteban and Leoncio
  Carrión, and herbalists Manuel Bejarano, Elmer Cruz, and Iván Cruz.
- Thanks also go to Eric Rodriguez (Herbarium Truxillense, HUT) and Abundio Sagastegui,
  Segundo Leiva, and Mario Zapata (Herbario Antenor Orrego, HAO) for the use of their
  facilities and their assistance in plant identification.
