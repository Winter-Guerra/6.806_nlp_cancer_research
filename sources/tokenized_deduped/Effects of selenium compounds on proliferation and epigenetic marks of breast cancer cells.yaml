- Breast cancer is a global public health problem and the most frequent cause of cancer
  death among women.
- Mammary carcinogenesis is driven not only by genetic alterations but also by epigenetic
  disturbances.
- Because epigenetic marks are potentially reversible they represent promising molecular
  targets for breast cancer prevention interventions.
- Selenium is a promising anti-breast cancer trace element that has shown the modulation
  of DNA methylation and histone post-translational modifications in other malignancies.
- This study aimed to evaluate the effects of selenium compounds [methylseleninic
  acid (MSA) and selenite] on cell proliferation and death, expression of the tumor
  suppressor gene RASSF1A and epigenetic marks in MCF-7 human breast adenocarcinoma
  cells.
- Treatment with MSA or selenite markedly inhibited (_P_ &lt; 0.05) in a dose-dependent
  manner the proliferation of MCF-7 cells.
- MSA induced (_P_ &lt; 0.05) G2/M cell arrest while selenite presented the opposite
  effect.
- Regarding cell death induction, MSA acted mainly by inducing apoptosis (_P_ &lt;
  0.05), while selenite only induced necrosis (_P_ &lt; 0.05).
- Furthermore selenite, but not MSA, markedly induced (_P_ &lt; 0.05) cytotoxicity
  and increased (_P_ &lt; 0.05) RASSF1A expression.
- Both selenium compounds inhibited (_P_ &lt; 0.05) DNMT1 expression.
- MSA decreased (_P_ &lt; 0.05) H3K9me3 and increased (_P_ &lt; 0.05) H4K16ac, while
  selenite decreased (_P_ &lt; 0.05) this latter histone mark.
- To the best of our knowledge this is the first report showing that selenite and
  MSA modulate epigenetic marks specifically in breast cancer cells.
- Our data reinforce the anti-breast cancer potential of selenium that is dependent
  on its chemical form.
- Furthermore the data show that epigenetic mechanisms represent relevant molecular
  targets involved in selenium inhibitory effects in breast cancer cells.
