- Many anti-tumor drugs function by intercalating into DNA.
- The xanthine alkaloid caffeine can also intercalate into DNA as well as form π-π
  molecular complexes with other planar alkaloids and anti-tumor drugs.
- The presence of caffeine could interfere with the intercalating anti-tumor drug
  by forming π-π molecular complexes with the drug, thereby blocking the planar aromatic
  drugs from intercalating into the DNA and ultimately lowering the toxicity of the
  drug to the cancer cells.
- The cytotoxic activities of several known DNA intercalators (berberine, camptothecin,
  chelerythrine, doxorubicin, ellipticine, and sanguinar-ine) on MCF-7 breast cancer
  cells, both with and without caffeine present (200 μg/mL) were determined.
- Significant attenuation of the cytotoxicities by caffeine was found.
- Computational molecular modeling studies involving the intercalating anti-tumor
  drugs with caffeine were also carried out using density functional theory (DFT)
  and the recently developed M06 functional.
- Relatively strong π-π interaction energies between caffeine and the intercalators
  were found, suggesting an "interceptor" role of caffeine protecting the DNA from
  intercalation .
