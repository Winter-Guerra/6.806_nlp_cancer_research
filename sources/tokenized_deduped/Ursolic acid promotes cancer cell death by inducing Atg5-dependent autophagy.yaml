- Ursolic acid (UA) has been reported to possess anticancer activities.
- Although some of the anticancer activities of UA have been explained by its apoptosis-inducing
  properties, the mechanisms underlying its anticancer actions are largely unknown.
- We have found that UA-activated autophagy induced cytotoxicity and reduced tumor
  growth of cervical cancer cells TC-1 in a concentration-dependent manner.
- UA did not induce apoptosis of TC-1 cells _in vitro_ as determined by annexin V/propidium
  iodide staining, DNA fragmentation, and Western blot analysis of the apoptosis-related
  proteins.
- We found that UA increased punctate staining of light chain 3 (LC3), which is an
  autophagy marker.
- LC3II, the processed form of LC3I which is formed during the formation of double
  membranes, was induced by UA treatment.
- These results were further confirmed by transmission electron microscopy.
- Wortmannin, an inhibitor of autophagy, and a small interfering RNA (siRNA) for autophagy-related
  genes (Atg5) reduced LC3II and simultaneously increased the survival of TC-1 cells
  treated with UA.
- We also found that LC3II was significantly reduced and that survival was increased
  in Atg5−/− mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells compared to Atg5+/+ MEF cells
  under UA treatment.
- However, silencing BECN1 by siRNA affected neither the expression of LC3II nor the
  survival of TC-1 cells under UA treatment.
- These results suggest that autophagy is a major mechanism by which UA kills TC-1
  cells.
- It is Atg5 rather than BECN1 that plays a crucial role in UA-induced autophagic
  cell death in TC-1 cells.
- The activation of autophagy by UA may become a potential cancer therapeutic strategy
  complementing the apoptosis-based therapies.
- Furthermore, regulation of Atg5 may improve the efficacy of UA in cancer treatment.
- Autophagy is a phenomenon that occurs in all eukaryotic cells ranging from yeast
  to mammals.
- Like apoptosis, autophagy has been suggested to be an important mechanism in maintaining
  cellular homeostasis in response to a variety of stimuli such as nutrient deprivation,
  high temperatures, and hypoxia.
- Autophagy begins with the formation of a double-membrane structure called autophagosome
  which contains subcellular structures.
- These autophagosomes fuse with lysosomes to become autolysosomes where their contents
  are degraded into parts that can be reused elsewhere in the cell.
- '[1] The molecular mechanism of autophagy was initially studied in yeast.'
- In total, more than 20 different autophagy-related genes (Atgs) have been identified.
- Among them, BECN1 (the mammalian ortholog of yeast Atg 6) acts during the nucleation
  and expansion of the autophagosomal membrane.
- '[2] The microtubule-associated protein light chain 3, LC3 (Atg8 in yeast), is associated
  with the double membranes of autophagosomes.'
- The recruitment of LC3 to the membrane occurs _via_ an Atg5-dependent mechanism,
  and thus Atg5 is essential for autophagosome formation.
- '[3, 4]


  Increasing evidence has shown that autophagy is involved in tumorigenesis.'
- '[5] It has been reported that when organelles and portions of the cytoplasm are
  degraded beyond a certain threshold, autophagic cell death is induced.'
- '[6, 7] It is also possible that autophagy can kill the cells by selective degradation
  of essential proteins.'
- Autophagic cell death is regulated by a molecular mechanism distinct from that of
  apoptosis although BECN1 and Bcl-2 can cooperate with Atg5 to regulate both autophagy
  and apoptosis.
- '[8] This cell death may prevent neoplasia and thus the activation of the nonapoptotic
  autophagic cell death program is emerging as a potential cancer therapy complementing
  apoptosis-based therapies.'
- '[9]


  Ursolic acid (UA), a natural pentacyclic triterpenoid carboxylic acid, is a potent
  anticancer agent.'
- It has been shown to prevent tumorigenesis, inhibit tumor growth[10, 11] and suppress
  angiogenesis.
- '[12] UA was shown to sensitize cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agents, to induce
  cancer cell apoptosis and to inhibit the growth of DU145 cells in nude mice.'
- '[13-15] UA was found to trigger apoptosis in MCF-7 breast cancer cells,[16] inhibit
  the proliferation of mutated human colorectal cancer cells[17] and induce apoptosis
  in cervical carcinoma cells.'
- '[18] Although the anticancer activities of UA may partially be attributable to
  its apoptosis-inducing properties, the exact mechanisms of its anticancer actions
  are largely unknown.'
- Efficacy of anticancer chemotherapeutic drugs relies on their ability to trigger
  cell death.
- Some anticancer drugs such as tamoxifen, arsenic trioxide, resveratrol and soybean
  B-group have been recently reported to induce autophagic cell death.
- '[19-22] In our study, we tested the hypothesis that UA also induces autophagic
  cell death under certain conditions.'
- We demonstrated that UA promotes tumor cell autophagy, resulting in nonapoptotic
  cell death and a delay of tumor growth _in vivo_.
- We further showed that Atg5 plays a crucial role in UA-induced autophagic cell death
  while BECN1 makes little contribution.
- UA (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide, and stored
  at −20°C.
- 'Empirical formula: C30H48O3; molecular weight: 456.70.'

- Both media were supplemented with 10% v/v fetal bovine serum and 1% v/v penicillin/streptomycin.
- Cells were grown at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere consisting of 5% CO2.
- In some experiments, cells were exposed to various inhibitors for 1 hr prior to
  UA treatment, such as 10 mM 3-methyladenine (3-MA), 400 nM Wortmannin and 50 mM
  LY294002 to inhibit phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K); 10 mM U0126 to inhibit MEK1/2;
  20 μM SB203580 to inhibit the activation of MAPK; 20 μM SP600125 to inhibit the
  activation of JUN; or 100 nM Bafilomycin, 2 μg/mL E64d and Pepstatin to inhibit
  degradation of LC3 II.
- All of these inhibitors were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO).
- Female C57BL/6J mice (age, 6-8 weeks) were purchased from the Laboratory Animal
  Services Center, Sun Yat-sen University, and fed a standard animal diet and water
  _ad libitum_.
- Tumor cells were harvested by trypsinization, washed twice with 1× phosphate-buffered
  saline (PBS) and finally resuspended in PBS to the designated concentration for
  injection.
- Viable cells (1 × 106 in 100 μL of PBS) were inoculated in the left legs of mice.
- The mice were randomly grouped (six mice _per_ group) and subcutaneously injected
  with various doses of UA (0, 25 and 50 mg/kg) for 10 weeks.
- About 2 weeks after inoculation with TC-1 tumor cells, tumors were visible in the
  left legs of the mice.
- Tumor growth was monitored by visual inspection and palpation twice a week.

- Cell proliferation was assessed by methylthiazolyltetrazolium (MTT) assays.
- Cells (1 × 104) were cultured in 96-well plates in the presence (10, 20 and 30 μM)
  or absence of UA in a final volume of 200 μL for 5 days.
- At the end of the treatment, 10 μL of MTT (5 mg/mL in PBS) was added to each well.
- After 2 hr of incubation, MTT formazan precipitate was dissolved in 100 μL of dimethyl
  sulfoxide.
- We allowed the plates to stand for 10 min at room temperature and recorded the absorbance
  at 560 nm.
- Tests were performed at least three times.
- Cell viability was tested by first plating wild-type Atg5+/+ MEFs, Atg5−/− MEFs
  or TC-1 cells at 2 × 105 cells/well in six-well plates.
- 'On the following day, UA (final concentration: 0, 10, 20 or 30 μM) was added and
  the cells were further cultured for 24 hr at 37°C.'
- Viability was measured by trypan blue exclusion assay.
- Each data point was the average of three different experiments in duplicates.
- Apoptosis rates were determined by flow cytometry using an annexin V/propidium iodide
  (PI) kit (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO).
- Staining was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions.
- The percentages of cells staining annexin V positive but PI negative were calculated
  as early apoptosis rate, whereas those of cells staining annexin V and PI double
  positive were calculated as percentages of total dead cells.
- DNA fragmentation, which is an indicator of apoptosis, was measured by DNA fragmentation
  assay using spectrophotometry.
- The procedures were according to the instructions of Apoptotic DNA Ladder Kit (Roche,
  Indianapolis, Indiana).
- Cell extracts were prepared from TC-1 cells (1 × 106 cells) treated with UA at concentrations
  of 0, 10, 20 or 30 μM for 48 hr.
- After electrophoresis in a 1.8% agarose gel, the gel was stained with ethidium bromide
  and the DNA ladder was visualized under UV light.
- Cells grown in 10-cm dishes were treated with UA for 48 hr and then analyzed _via_
  Western blotting.
- Protein samples (total protein/sample, 50 μg) were loaded to 12% SDS-PAGE gels.
- After separation, the protein bands were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes.
- The membranes were blocked with TBST buffer containing 5% nonfat milk, incubated
  with a primary antibody (1:1,000, Sigma) for the detection of caspase-3, PARP, caspase-9,
  Bcl-2 and Bax proteins at 4°C overnight, followed by the addition of horseradish
  peroxidase-linked antirabbit antibody (1:200) and enhanced chemiluminescence visualization
  of the bands.
- All Western blot experiments were repeated at least three times and the representative
  images were shown.
- Cells were initially fixed in 0.1 M of sodium phosphate buffer containing 2.5% glutaraldehyde,
  pH 7.4, and then fixed in the same buffer containing 1% osmium tetroxide, pH 7.2.
- Cells were next embedded into Ultracut (Leica, Germany) and sliced into 60-nm sections.
- Ultrathin sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and examined
  with a JEM-1230 transmission electron microscope.
- TC-1 cells (2 × 105 cells/well) cultured in a six-well tissue plate were transiently
  transfected with 100 nM of Atg5 small interfering RNA (siRNA), BECN1 siRNA or Control
  siRNA (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
- Seventy-two hours after transfection, cells were subjected to the indicated further
  treatments.
- All data were expressed as mean ± SD.
- Statistical Package for Social Sciences software (SPSS 13.5) was used for one-way
  ANOVA to compare the experimental groups.
- Differences were considered significant if _p_ &lt; 0.05.
- To assess the effects of UA on TC-1 cell proliferation _in vitro_, we treated the
  cells with increasing concentrations of UA for 5 days and assayed the cell growth
  by MTT assays.
- Dose-response curves were plotted and showed that UA strongly inhibited TC-1 cell
  proliferation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.
- 1_a_).
- Figure 1\.

- (_f_) Representative images of H&amp;E-stained tumor sections.
- White arrows indicate areas of necrosis.
- '[Color figure can be viewed in the online issue, which is available at wileyonlinelibrary.com.]'
- To evaluate the effects of UA on tumor growth _in vivo_, we used a well-established
  TC-1 xenograft mouse model.
- Tumor growth was significantly inhibited in the UA-treated groups compared to the
  control group; the decrease in tumor growth was UA dose dependent (Figs.
- 1_b_ and 1_c_).
- After the mice were treated with UA for 10 weeks, only small tumors were macroscopically
  visible near the left leg; in contrast, much larger tumors are visible in the control
  mice (Figs.
- 1_d_ and 1_e_).
- Histological examination of tumor sections showed the presence of a significant
  amount of necrosis in the tumors of UA-treated mice as indicated by the arrows in
  Figure 1_f_.
- Taken together, these results suggested that UA strongly inhibited the proliferation
  of TC-1 cells _in vitro_ and significantly reduced tumor growth _in vivo_.
- To explore the mechanism underlying tumor growth inhibition caused by UA, we first
  examined the effect of UA on apoptotic death of TC-1 by FACS analysis using annexin
  V/PI staining.
- As shown in Figure 2_a_, the total percentage of dead cells gradually increased
  in a UA dose-dependent manner.
- However, the percentage of the early apoptotic cells (annexin positive but PI negative)
  did not significantly increase.
- The result revealed that the strong cytotoxic effect of UA may not involve apoptosis
  of TC-1 cells.
- Figure 2\.
- UA did not induce apoptosis in TC-1 cells.

- (_d_) The Western blot analysis of total TC-1 cells lysates for caspase-3, caspase-8,
  PARP, Bcl-2 and Bax.
- GAPDH was used to normalize protein loading.
- '[Color figure can be viewed in the online issue, which is available at wileyonlinelibrary.com.]'
- We then performed DNA fragmentation assays.
- The result showed that UA did not induce any DNA fragmentation under the concentration
  range used.
- However, the DNA ladder, typically indicative of apoptosis, became apparent in HeLa
  cells treated with UA (Fig.
- 2_b_).
- Apoptosis is a highly regulated process that involves activation of a series of
  molecular events leading to cell death.
- Regulation of the apoptotic pathway is controlled by apoptosis-related proteins.
- Therefore, we assessed the expression of apoptosis-related proteins, including caspase-3,
  caspase-9, PARP, Bcl-2 and Bax, by Western blot analysis.
- No significant differences in these proteins were observed in TC-1 cells treated
  with UA at different concentrations (Fig.
- 2_c_).
- Taken together, these results suggest that the _in vitro_ proliferation suppressing
  activity and the _in vivo_ tumor growth inhibitory effect of UA are not primarily
  owing to the induction of apoptosis, rather owing to the induction of nonapoptotic
  death in TC-1 cells.
- Transmission electron microscopy was used to monitor autophagy of TC-1 cells in
  response to UA (Fig.
- 3).
- After exposure to 30 μM of UA for 24 hr, there were a large number of autophagic
  vacuoles presented in UA-treated cells, but not in untreated cells.
- The presence of double-membrane containing cellular organelles was observed in TC-1-treated
  cells at higher magnification.
- UA-treated HeLa cells exhibited typical apoptosis characteristics in nucleus change.

- '[Color figure can be viewed in the online issue, which is available at wileyonlinelibrary.com.]'
- We observed that TC-1 cells treated with UA accumulated vacuoles in cytoplasm and
  displayed punctuated staining of LC3, a marker of autophagosome (Fig.
- 4_a_).
- Induction of autophagy was confirmed by Western blotting for LC3.
- LC3 II, a processed form of LC3I formed during the formation of the double membrane,
  was increased by UA treatment in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.
- 4_b_).
- Figure 4\.

  by Western blotting.

- '[Color figure can be viewed in the online issue, which is available at wileyonlinelibrary.com.]'
- TC-1 cells treated with UA in the presence or absence of inhibitors were used to
  assess both the induction of autophagy and the autophagic flux caused by UA.
- Figure 4_c_ shows that the increased expression of LC3II was abrogated by Wortmannin
  and LY294002, two PI3K inhibitors.
- Although 3-MA did not have a significant effect, the results indicated that PI3K
  signaling may be involved in UA-induced autophagy.
- In contrast, Bafilomycin, E64d and Pepstatin decreased the degradation of LC3 in
  lysosomes, which in turn, caused both LC3I and LC3II accumulation in TC-1 cells.
- The MEK inhibitor U0126, the p38 inhibitor SB203580 and the JUN inhibitor SP600125
  had little effects on autophagy induced by UA, indicating that MAPK signaling is
  not involved in UA-induced autophagy in TC-1 cells (Supporting Information Fig.
- S1A).
- To determine whether autophagy induced by UA was responsible for the reduced viability
  of TC-1 cells, we measured the viability after 24 hr of UA treatment.
- The viability of TC-1 cells was significantly restored by Wortmannin, but not by
  LY294002 or 3-MA.
- Moreover, the increase in autophagy induced by Bafilomycin A, E64d and Pepstatin
  was accompanied by a decrease in TC-1 viability (Fig.
- 4_d_ and Supporting Information Fig.
- S2).
- This data pointed out a previously unseen role of UA in inducing autophagy that
  leads to cell death in TC-1 cells.
- We hypothesized that if autophagy was important in UA cytotoxicity to tumor cells,
  Atg5−/− cells would be less sensitive to UA.
- In our study, we found significantly more cell viability during UA treatment in
  Atg5−/− cells as compared to Atg5+/+ cells (Figs.
- 5_a_ and 5_b_).
- This effect correlates with the LC3 II processing that was observed only in Atg5+/+
  cells in response to UA and was concentration dependent (Fig.
- 5_c_).
- Silencing of Atg5 in TC-1 tumor cells by siRNA decreased the expression of LC3 II
  (Figs.
- 5_d_-5_f_) and reduced the UA cytotoxicity in TC-1 cells (Fig.
- 6_a_).
- BECN1, an essential mediator of autophagy, plays pivotal role during the nucleation
  and expansion of the autophagosomal membrane, we explored whether BECN1 is required
  in autophagosome formation in UA-treated cells.
- However, reduction of BECN1 levels by siRNA affected neither the expression of LC3II
  nor the survival of TC-1 cells during UA treatment (Figs.
- 6_b_ and 6_c_).
- Taken together, our results suggested that cell death of TC-1 cells induced by UA
  is dependent on Atg5, but not BECN1.
- The results indicated that Atg5, but not BECN1, is involved in UA-induced autophagy
  and toxicity in TC-1 tumor cells.
- Figure 5\.

- (_d_) Schematic diagram shows the mechanism by which UA induces cell death in TC-1

- '[Color figure can be viewed in the online issue, which is available at wileyonlinelibrary.com.]'
- The results of our study have shown that UA is highly effective in inducing death
  of TC-1 cells and inhibiting tumor growth in a TC-1 xenograft mouse model (Fig.
- 1).
- Mechanistic study showed that the apoptotic pathway was not activated by UA in TC-1
  cells (Fig.
- 2).
- Instead, autophagy may be a major mechanism for TC-1 cell death induced by UA and
  UA-induced autophagy was dependent on Atg5, but not on BECN1.
- TC-1 cells were derived from primary lung epithelial cells and immortalized by HPV
  16 E6/E7 and then transformed with an activated ras oncogene.
- This transformation process imitates the natural tumor progression of cervical cancer.
- '[23] We found that UA did not change the level of HPV 16 E6 gene and Ras expression
  (Supporting Information Fig.'
- S2).
- But UA decreased the expression of HPV18 E6/E7 gene in HeLa cells,[24] suggesting
  that UA exerts effects on TC-1 cells and HeLa cells by different mechanisms.
- UA has been reported to possess anticancer activities through inducing apoptosis
  of tumor cells, such as gastric cancer cell line BGC-803, hepatocellular cancer
  cell HepG2 and MCF-7 breast cancer cells.
- '[25-27] However, TC-1 cell death induced by UA lacked the features of apoptosis,
  such as nuclear fragmentation, apoptotic body formation and chromatin condensation
  (Fig.'
- 2).
- In the absence of these characteristics of apoptosis, mitochondrial swelling (data
  not shown) and autophagic vacuoles were observed instead (Fig.
- 4_a_).
- Transmission electron microscopy showed a marked activity of autophagy with accumulation
  of autophagosomes (Fig.
- 3_b_).
- The formation of autophagosomes was confirmed by using autophagy marker LC3.
- Immunofluorescence studies revealed a clear accumulation of LC3 in the autophagosomes
  of UA-treated cells (Fig.
- 4_a_).
- LC3 is a microtubule-associated protein that is associated with the formation of
  autophagosomes through the conversion of LC3I (cytosolic) to LC3II (membrane bound).
- Our studies showed that LC3II was increased by the treatment of UA in a concentration-dependent
  manner (Fig.
- 4_b_), indicating that autophagic process is tightly linked to UA cytotoxicity.
- Several signaling transduction pathways have been reported to be involved in autophagy,
  such as the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway and the Ras/MEK/ERK pathway.
- '[28-30] It appears that upstream signals to induce autophagy are stimulus dependent.'
- In our study, the increase in expression of LC3II was abrogated by Wortmannin and
  LY294002, two PI3K inhibitors (Fig.
- 4_c_).
- The results indicate that PI3K is required as an initial signal in UA-induced autophagy.
- However, 3-MA, another PI3K inhibitor, did not significantly decrease the expression
  of LC3II.
- The reason may be that 3-MA can inhibit both Class I PI3K activity (which inhibits
  autophagy) and Class III PI3K activity (which is required for autophagy), and thus
  the overall effect of 3-MA may not be apparent.
- '[31] Interestingly, the viability of TC-1 cells was significantly restored by Wortmannin.'
- However, similar results were not observed by using LY294002.
- LY294002 may have some additional effects on cell survival by targeting its ATP-binding
  site.
- '[32] Autophagic flux can be measured by inferring degradation of LC3II in autolysosomes.'
- Inhibiting the degradation can be achieved by using bafilomycin, which blocks the
  fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes, and protease inhibitors (_e.g_., E64d and
  pepstatin).
- '[33, 34] Bafilomycin, E64d and pepstatin resulted in accumulation of both LC3I
  and LC3II in the TC-1 cells, and hence increased the total LC3 level induced by
  UA while simultaneously decreasing the viability of TC-1 cells (Fig.'
- 4_d_ and Supporting Information Fig.
- S1B).
- This is owing to the fact that when LC3 levels are beyond a certain threshold autophagic
  cell death may be enhanced.
- Taken together, these data revealed a previously unseen role for UA in inducing
  autophagy-mediated death of TC-1 cells.
- 'We test the effect of UA on other two gynecological tumor cell lines: ID8 and 4T1.'
- ID8, a cell line derived from spontaneous _in vitro_ malignant transformation of
  C57BL/6 mouse ovarian surface epithelial cells.
- 4T1 cells were the mouse breast cancer cell line.
- '[35, 36] We also found that UA increased the level of autophagy in both 4T1 and
  ID8 with dose-dependent manner, meanwhile significantly decreased the viability
  of the two cell lines (Supporting Information Fig.'
- S3).
- Autophagy and autophagic cell death may share common machinery utilizing Atg5.
- Atg5 plays a crucial role in IFN-γ-induced autophagic cell death by interacting
  with FADD as a necessary step leading to cell death,[37] whereas upregulation of
  Atg5 is necessary for the oncogenic H-ras-induced autophagic cell death.
- '[38] Our study showed that Atg5 was required for LC3-II expression in UA-treated
  cells, and was thus involved in autophagic cell death in response to UA.'
- These findings implicate a role for Atg5 in promoting UA-mediated autophagic cell
  death.
- BECN1 acts as a tumor suppressor gene in mice and is frequently deleted in human
  cancers.
- '[39-41] BECN1 is involved in some autophagic cell deaths but not in others.'
- The BECN1-independent autophagic death is attracting increasing interests in the
  development of new strategies for cancer treatment.
- '[42, 43] Pathological stimulation of BECN1-independent autophagy is associated
  with neuronal cell death.'
- '[44] Arsenic trioxide induced a BECN1-independent autophagic pathway in ovarian
  carcinoma cells.'
- '[45, 46] In our study, inhibition of BECN1 by siRNA did not change the expression
  of LC3II and cell death in response to UA, suggesting that UA induced a BECN1-independent
  autophagic pathway in TC-1 cells.'
- Therefore, for those human cancer cells that are resistant to drugs that induce
  caspase-dependent apoptotic cell death owing to the deletion of BECN1, UA may still
  be effective.
- Furthermore, the regulation of autophagy _via_ Atg5 can increase the levels of cell
  death and enhance the efficiency of UA.
- Thus, the combination of drugs that induces apoptotic cell death and UA may yield
  synergistic clinical benefit in cancer treatment.
- These results also suggest that UA may be a potent complementary therapy for cancers
  that are resistant to caspase-dependent apoptotic cell death.
- In summary, our study demonstrated for the first time that UA induced autophagy
  in TC-1 cervical cancer cells through PI3-K signaling pathways that have been previously
  implicated in the control of the induction of autophagy.
- The autophagy induction is a major mechanism for UA-induced TC-1 cell death, and
  UA-induced autophagy is dependent on Atg5, but not BECN1.
- This new anticancer mechanism of UA suggests that UA may be a potent complementary
  drug for cancer treatment when patients are unresponsive to drugs that induce caspase-dependent
  apoptotic cell death.
