- While epidemiologic studies suggest that soy intake early in life may reduce breast
  cancer risk, there are also concerns that exposure to soy isoflavones during childhood
  may alter pubertal development and hormonal profiles.
- Here, we assessed the effect of a high-soy diet on pubertal breast development,
  sex hormones, and growth in a nonhuman primate model.
- 'Pubertal female cynomolgus monkeys were randomized to receive a diet modeled on
  a typical North American diet with one of two protein sources for approximately
  4.5 years: (i) casein/lactalbumin (CL, _n_ = 12, as control) or (ii) soy protein
  isolate with a human equivalent dose of 120 mg/d isoflavones (SOY, _n_ = 17), which
  is comparable to approximately four servings of soy foods.'
- Pubertal exposure to the SOY diet did not alter onset of menarche, indicators of
  growth and pubertal progression, or circulating estradiol and progesterone concentrations.
- Greater endometrial area was seen in the SOY group on the first of four postmenarchal
  ultrasound measurements (_P_ &lt; 0.05).
- There was a subtle effect of diet on breast differentiation whereby the SOY group
  showed higher numbers of differentiated large-sized lobular units and a lower proportion
  with immature ducts following menarche (_P_ &lt; 0.05).
- Numbers of small lobules and terminal end buds and mammary epithelial cell proliferation
  did not differ by diet.
- Expression of progesterone receptor was lower in immature lobules of soy-fed animals
  (_P_ &lt; 0.05).
- Our findings suggest that consumption of soy starting before menarche may result
  in modest effects consistent with a more differentiated breast phenotype in adulthood.
