- Selenium is an important cofactor in the production of antioxidant enzymes that
  may influence cancer progression.
- Selenium intake and cancer survival has not been extensively studied; however, selenium
  supplementation has been demonstrated to reduce cancer mortality in nutritional
  intervention trials.
- We investigated whether dietary selenium intake was associated with survival among
  3,146 women diagnosed with invasive breast cancer in the population-based Swedish
  Mammography Cohort.
- Selenium intake before breast cancer diagnosis was estimated using a food frequency
  questionnaire completed in 1987.
- Cox proportional hazard models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95
  % confidence intervals (95 % CIs) for death from breast cancer, non-breast cancer
  death, and death from any cause.
- During 28,172 person-years of follow-up from 1987 to 2009, there were 416 breast
  cancer–specific deaths and 964 total deaths.
- Dietary selenium intake was inversely associated with breast cancer–specific mortality
  and overall mortality.
- Women in the highest quartile of selenium intake had a multivariable HR (95 % CI)
  of death from breast cancer of 0.69 (0.52–0.92) compared with those in the lowest
  quartile (_P_ trend = 0.009).
- The inverse association between dietary selenium intake and breast cancer death
  appeared strongest among women who had ever smoked (HR = 0.34; 95 % CI 0.14–0.83;
  _P_ trend = 0.01) comparing the highest to lowest quartile.
- Our findings suggest that selenium intake before breast cancer diagnosis may improve
  breast cancer–specific survival and overall survival.
- However, these results may be limited to populations with low intakes of selenium.
- Selenium is an essential trace element that is an important cofactor in the production
  of antioxidant enzymes that may influence cancer initiation and progression.
- Animal models support a preventive role of selenium in carcinogenesis [1], while
  observational epidemiologic studies primarily provide some evidence for a role of
  selenium in prostate cancer prevention with less convincing evidence for other cancers
  [2].
- Selenium intake and survival following cancer diagnosis has been less extensively
  studied; however, selenium supplementation has been demonstrated to reduce all-cause
  and cancer mortality in some randomized nutritional intervention trials [3, 4],
  while in the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT), selenium supplementation
  had no influence on all-cause mortality [5].
- To our knowledge, only two studies have examined the association between selenium
  intake and mortality among women with breast cancer.
- Holmes et al.
- reported a non-significant inverse association between selenium intake and all-cause
  mortality among women in the Nurses’ Health Study [6].
- Conversely, Saquib et al.
- observed a non-significant increase in all-cause mortality for selenium levels exceeding
  the U.S. dietary reference upper tolerable limit (400 μg) compared with women with
  adequate intake [7].
- In this study, we investigated whether pre-diagnosis selenium intake was associated
  with breast cancer survival among women diagnosed with invasive breast cancer in
  the population-based Swedish Mammography Cohort, a population with low selenium
  intake.
- We also examined whether the association between selenium intake and survival differed
  by hormone receptor status, disease stage at diagnosis, by oxidative stress related
  factors (smoking status, age, and body mass index), and other antioxidant micronutrients.
- This study included 3,146 participants in the Swedish Mammography Cohort (SMC) with
  invasive breast cancer diagnosed from 1987 to 2008.
- Recruitment and characteristics of this cohort have been previously described [8].
- In brief, the SMC is a population-based cohort of 66,651 women born between 1914
  and 1948 that were recruited between 1987 and 1990 in Västmanland and Uppsala counties
  in central Sweden.
- Participants completed a baseline questionnaire with questions regarding diet, reproductive,
  and other factors.
- In 1997, a second questionnaire was extended to include dietary supplements, physical
  activity, and smoking status and was sent to participants who were still alive and
  residing in the study area; 39,227 (70 %) women returned this questionnaire.
- Those with an incorrect or missing national registration number, previous cancer
  diagnosis (except non-melanoma skin cancer), and implausible total energy intake
  (3 standard deviations [SD] from the mean value for loge-transformed energy intake)
  were excluded from the baseline cohort.
- Completion and return of the self-administered questionnaire was treated as informed
  consent of study participants.
- The study was approved by the ethics committee at the Karolinska Institutet.
- Histologically confirmed incident invasive breast cancer cases were ascertained
  by linkage of the study cohort with the Swedish Cancer Registry.
- This registry has been estimated to provide almost 100 % complete case ascertainment
  [9].
- Estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) status and other clinical
  characteristics were obtained by reviewing pathology laboratory works logs from
  Uppsala University Hospital and by linkage with the clinical database at the Regional
  Oncology Centre in Uppsala.
- ER and PR status, menopausal status at diagnosis, tumor size, grade, lymph node
  involvement, and type of treatment were available for approximately 77 % of the
  cases.
- More detailed information on the evaluation of hormone receptor status in this cohort
  has been described previously [10].
- Diet was assessed using a 67-item food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) at baseline
  and a 96-item FFQ in 1997.
- Participants were asked how often, on average, they had consumed each food item
  or beverage during the previous 6 months (1987) or year (1997).
- Eight responses were possible ranging from never or seldom to four or more times
  per day.
- Information on dietary supplement use was not obtained at baseline.
- Selenium intake was calculated as the frequency of consumption of each food item
  multiplied by its selenium content per age-specific serving using food composition
  values obtained from the Swedish National Food Administration Database [11].
- The baseline FFQ has been previously validated for foods that were the main sources
  of dietary selenium in our population.
- Among 129 participants randomly chosen from the study population, correlation coefficients
  between the questionnaire and the mean of four 1-week dietary records ranged 0.4–0.5
  for fish [8], 0.3–0.6 for milk [12], 0.3–0.7 for meat products [10], and 0.5 for
  eggs [13].
- Nutrient intakes were adjusted for energy using the residual method [14].
- Date of death was identified through linkage to the Swedish National Death Registry.
- Cause of death was determined by International Classification of Diseases (ICD)
  codes (ICD9 and ICD10) through linkage to the Cause of Death Registry at the National
  Bureau of Health and Welfare.
- Cox proportional hazard models with time since diagnosis in months as the time scale
  were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CIs)
  for death from breast cancer.
- Participants contributed person-time from the date of breast cancer diagnosis until
  death from breast cancer (primary endpoint), death from another cause or end of
  follow-up on December 31, 2009.
- Baseline diet (1987) was considered the exposure in all analyses except when dietary
  change was examined.
- Selenium intake was categorized in quartiles with the lowest quartile as the reference
  group.
- Total caloric intake and age at diagnosis were included in all models.
- Education level, marital status, menopausal status at diagnosis, body mass index
  (BMI), and calendar year of diagnosis were considered potential confounders in all
  multivariable models.
- Parity, age at first birth, oral contraceptive use, postmenopausal hormone use,
  height, and family history of breast cancer were not observed to be confounders
  and were not included in the final models.
- 'Multivariable models were adjusted for the following clinical characteristics:
  stage, grade of tumor, radiation treatment, and chemotherapy/hormonal therapy.'
- We also adjusted for physical activity among women who completed the 1997 questionnaire.
- Tests for linear trend were performed by assigning the median value of each quartile
  to each participant in that group.
- We conducted sensitivity analyses excluding women with stage IV cancer and excluding
  those who reported taking a supplement containing selenium on the 1997 FFQ.
- We examined whether the association between selenium and breast cancer survival
  differed by hormone receptor status, disease stage at diagnosis, smoking status,
  age, BMI, and other antioxidant micronutrients (α-tocopherol, beta-carotene, or
  vitamin C) with a likelihood ratio test comparing the model with the cross-product
  term between selenium and each potential effect modifier to the model with main
  effects only.
- All tests of statistical significance were two-sided and statistical analyses were
  performed using SAS Version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).
- During 28,172 person-years of follow-up contributed by 3,146 breast cancer cases,
  there were 964 deaths with 416 deaths from breast cancer.
- The mean (±SD) age at diagnosis was 65 years (±10.2) and the median follow-up time
  was 9.0 years (range 1 month to 22 years).
- Dietary assessment occurred a median of 10.6 years before breast cancer diagnosis
  (range 1 month to 19.3 years).
- Mean selenium intake was 24.7 μg/day (±6.8).
- The main sources of dietary selenium in the study population were fish (27.1 %),
  dairy products (20.6 %), meat (11.0 %), eggs (6.6 %), and hard bread (4.8 %).
- Women in the highest quartile of selenium intake were more likely to have a post-secondary
  education, to use postmenopausal hormones, consumed more alcohol than women in the
  lowest quartile of selenium intake, and were less likely to have been diagnosed
  with stage III or IV breast cancer (Table 1).
- "Characteristics of 3,146 women with invasive breast cancer in the Swedish Mammography
  Cohort by quartiles of dietary selenium intakea  \n\n\n\n\n\nSelenium intake was
  inversely associated with breast cancer mortality (Table 2)."
- Women in the highest quartile of selenium intake had a covariate-adjusted HR (95
  % CI) of death from breast cancer of 0.64 (0.48–0.84) compared with those in the
  lowest quartile (_P_ trend = 0.001).
- Adjustment for clinical characteristics and treatment did not materially alter the
  results (HR for top to bottom quartile = 0.69; 95 % CI 0.52–0.92; _P_ trend = 0.009).
- In a sensitivity analysis that excluded women with stage IV breast cancer, results
  were not materially different than the main analysis (corresponding covariate and
  clinical characteristics–adjusted HR = 0.70; 95 % CI 0.53–0.94; _P_ trend = 0.02).
- We also adjusted for physical activity among women who completed the 1997 questionnaire
  and saw no change in the effect estimates.
- Results were similar but slightly attenuated when death from any cause was the outcome,
  and when death from a cause other than breast cancer was considered the outcome,
  the covariate and clinical adjusted trend was borderline significant (_P_ trend
  = 0.06; Table 2).
- The association between selenium intake and non-breast deaths appeared to be driven
  by deaths from other cancers as when these deaths were excluded the association
  was attenuated and the trend was not significant (_P_ trend = 0.16).

  and chemotherapy)\n\nWe evaluated the association of foods that were the main sources
  of dietary selenium in our population to explore if any of these foods could explain
  the association between selenium and breast cancer–specific mortality."
- There was a non-significant inverse association between fish consumption and breast
  cancer–specific mortality.
- Women consuming five or more servings of fish per week had a covariate and clinical
  characteristics–adjusted HR of 0.57 (95 % CI 0.27–1.23) compared with those consuming
  less than one serving per week; however, adjustment for selenium attenuated these
  results (corresponding HR = 0.93; 95 % CI 0.40–2.12) while selenium remained significantly
  inversely associated with breast cancer mortality in this model (HR for highest
  quartile = 0.57; 95 % CI 0.39–0.81).
- In addition, adjustment for dietary marine ω-3 fatty acids did not alter the association.
- Other sources of selenium, including milk, cheese, meat, eggs, and hard bread, as
  well as protein, were not significantly associated with breast cancer–specific mortality
  and selenium was still significantly associated with mortality following adjustment
  for these foods and nutrients (data not shown).
- No heterogeneity in the associations between selenium and breast cancer–specific
  mortality was observed by the hormone receptor status of the tumor (all _P_ heterogeneity
  ≥ 0.62; Table 3) or by disease stage at diagnosis (data not shown).
- The association between selenium and breast cancer death did not vary according
  to intake of other antioxidants (α-tocopherol, beta-carotene, or vitamin C).

  by the oxidative stress–related factors of smoking status, age, and BMI."
- In the subset of 1,761 women who reported their smoking habits on the 1997 questionnaire,
  there was the suggestion of a stronger inverse association between selenium intake
  and breast cancer mortality among women who had ever smoked.
- Among ever smokers (_N_ = 703), those in the highest quartile of selenium intake
  had a covariate-adjusted HR of 0.31 (95 % CI 0.13–0.74; _P_ trend = 0.005) and a
  covariate and clinical characteristics–adjusted HR of 0.34 (95 % CI 0.14–0.83; _P_
  trend = 0.01) compared with women in the lowest quartile.
- The corresponding covariate-adjusted HR for women who had never smoked (_N_ = 1,058)
  was 0.72 (95 % CI = 0.37–1.40; _P_ trend = 0.29).
- However, the _P_ value for heterogeneity was not significant (_P_ heterogeneity
  = 0.08).
- There was no evidence of heterogeneity by age or BMI (all _P_ heterogeneity ≥ 0.72).
- We compared dietary selenium intake among women who completed both the 1987 and
  1997 FFQs (_N_ = 1,996).
- Up to 84.3 % of women completing the 1997 FFQ remained in the same or adjacent quartile
  of selenium intake compared with the 1987 FFQ.
- Among the subset of women who were diagnosed with breast cancer from 1987 to 1996
  and completed a FFQ in 1997 following breast cancer diagnosis (_N_ = 717), up to
  85.3 % of these women remained in the same or adjacent quartile of selenium intake
  following breast cancer diagnosis.
- However, numbers were too small to examine the association between post-diagnosis
  selenium intake and survival in this group.
- In addition, 10.0 % of these 717 women reported the use of a supplement containing
  selenium in 1997 compared with 11.2 % among all women who completed both FFQs.
- In a sensitivity analysis that excluded women who reported taking a supplement containing
  selenium in 1997 results were not materially different than the main analysis (data
  not shown).
- In this prospective study among 3,146 women with invasive breast cancer, dietary
  selenium intake was inversely associated with breast cancer–specific and overall
  mortality.
- This association persisted after adjustment for intake of foods with high selenium
  content indicating that selenium intake itself was the most likely explanation for
  the observed inverse association.
- In addition, there was the suggestion that the inverse association was stronger
  among women who were ever smokers and thus exposed to higher levels of oxidative
  stress.
- The epidemiologic data regarding the relation between selenium and survival among
  women with breast cancer are sparse.
- To our knowledge, only two studies have examined the association between selenium
  intake and mortality following breast cancer diagnosis.
- Holmes et al.
- examined post-diagnosis intake of selenium among 1,982 women with invasive breast
  cancer in the Nurses’ Health Study (NHS) and reported a non-significant inverse
  association with all-cause mortality (total deaths = 378) [6].
- Hazard ratios &lt;1.0 were observed for the second through fifth quintiles compared
  with the first quintile with the lowest point estimate for the third quintile (HR
  for third quintile = 0.68, 95 % CI 0.44–1.05; HR for highest quintile = 0.86, 95
  % CI 0.62–1.19; _P_ trend = 0.20).
- In contrast, among 2,939 women with breast cancer enrolled in the Women’s Healthy
  Eating and Living (WHEL) Study (total deaths = 388), a u-shaped association was
  observed with a non-significant positive association reported between selenium intakes
  &gt;400 μg and all-cause mortality (HR = 1.5, 95 % CI 0.78–2.96) and a non-significant
  positive association with selenium intake &lt;55 μg (HR = 1.2, 95 % CI 0.55–2.50),
  using women with adequate intake as the reference group [7].
- In Sweden, selenium levels in soil are naturally low and our population had much
  lower selenium intake than these two American study populations.
- The highest selenium quartile in our population had selenium levels of 27.7 μg/day
  or higher (median intake in highest quartile = 31.6 μg/day) corresponding to the
  lowest category in the WHEL Study.
- Holmes et al.
- did not report the range of selenium intake among their breast cancer cases, but
  previous analyses in the NHS using toenail selenium levels have implied that the
  difference in selenium levels between the highest and lowest quintiles was at least
  100 μg/day [15], which is higher than the range of values observed in our population.
- Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) in the U.S.
  have reported mean serum selenium levels of 134.7 μg/L among women ≥40 years[16],
  whereas among a population of Swedish women with a median age of 38 years, median
  serum selenium levels were 70 μg/L [17].
- It is possible that in populations with adequately high levels of selenium intake,
  the protective effect of selenium may not be apparent [2].
- Previous investigations of intake of antioxidants and cancer prevention have resulted
  in discordant results between observational studies and randomized nutritional interventional
  trials.
- Some observational data suggest that higher intake of antioxidants reduces risk
  of certain cancers [2, 18–22], while intervention trials have observed an increased
  risk of lung cancer with beta-carotene supplement intake [23] and with a combination
  of beta-carotene and vitamin A [24], and an increased risk of prostate cancer with
  vitamin E supplement intake [5].
- Our results are consistent with two of three intervention trials that have examined
  selenium supplementation.
- The Nutritional Prevention of Cancer (NPC) trial randomized patients with a history
  of basal cell or squamous cell carcinomas who were living in low selenium areas
  of the U.S. to 200 μg/day of selenium or placebo.
- While selenium supplementation did not reduce the risk of basal cell or squamous
  cell carcinomas (the primary endpoints of the study), a significant reduction in
  total cancer mortality and a non-significant reduction in all-cause mortality were
  observed [4].
- In the Nutritional Intervention Trial in Linxian, China, where intake of several
  micronutrients is low, adults were randomized to four different combinations of
  nutrients including a supplement containing beta-carotene, vitamin E, and selenium
  (50 μg/day).
- A reduction in total mortality was observed in those receiving the beta-carotene,
  vitamin E, and selenium supplement but not among those receiving the other supplements
  or placebo [3].
- In contrast, the SELECT trial, which randomized U.S. and Canadian men to four groups
  (selenium [200 μg/day], vitamin E, selenium + vitamin E, and placebo), reported
  no association between selenium supplementation either alone or with vitamin E and
  all-cause deaths, a secondary study endpoint [5].
- Differences in baseline selenium plasma levels may potentially explain the differing
  results between the NPC and Linxian trial and SELECT.
- Participants in the NPC trial were recruited from low selenium areas in the Eastern
  U.S., and baseline mean plasma selenium level of participants was 115.1 ng/mL [25].
- Baseline mean serum selenium concentration in a subset of the Linxian cohort was
  73 μg/L [26], while median baseline serum selenium levels ranged from 135.0 to 137.6
  μg/L for the four groups in SELECT [27].
- In addition, in a follow-up report on the NPC trial, selenium supplementation reduced
  prostate cancer incidence only among participants in the bottom two tertiles of
  baseline plasma selenium further supporting a threshold effect for the benefits
  of selenium [25].
- The mechanisms through which selenium might influence cancer development and progression
  are not clear but may involve its incorporation into selenoproteins.
- The selenoprotein glutathione peroxidase (GPx) has antioxidant activities that may
  help prevent cellular damage from free radicals.
- Baliga et al.
- reported that GPx-1 attenuated UV-induced micronuclei formation most likely through
  either the prevention or repair of DNA damage [28].
- Mouse models have also demonstrated that higher selenium intake may increase survival
  time and age at tumor onset as well as decrease tumor incidence [29].
- The optimal activity of GPx is suggested to be reached at selenium intakes of 55–75
  μg/day [30, 31] which is consistent with a threshold effect above which intake of
  selenium may not appear to influence mortality or disease risk.
- In contrast, at low levels of selenium intake such as those observed in our population,
  the effect of selenium through its antioxidant activities may be most evident.
- We observed a stronger inverse association between selenium intake and breast cancer
  mortality among women who were current or former smokers.
- Cigarette smokers are subject to higher levels of oxidative stress as smoking is
  associated with reactive oxygen species production (ROS) [32].
- Although the mechanisms underlying the interaction between selenium and smoking
  are not known, GPx activity has been shown to be lower among smokers [33] and thus
  increased selenium intake may have a stronger influence on smokers reaching optimal
  GPx activity levels than non-smokers.
- Selenium has also been found to decrease ROS generation [34] which may also explain
  the stronger effect observed among smokers.
- Selenium levels in foods may vary between geographic regions because of the selenium
  content of the soil where the food was produced.
- Thus, epidemiologic studies often prefer to use toenail or plasma selenium levels
  to reflect body selenium status [35].
- A potential limitation of our study is the use of FFQ to assess selenium intake
  including the lack of validation data specifically for selenium intake estimated
  from the FFQ.
- However, a previous study in a population of Swedish women reported a significant
  association between serum selenium levels and fish consumption (the largest dietary
  contributory to selenium intake in our population) measured from a FFQ (_r_ = 0.35;
  _P_ = 0.002) [17].
- The FFQ has been previously validated with diet records for most foods that were
  the main contributors to selenium intake [8, 10, 12, 13].
- We expect that the errors in dietary assessment of selenium would be random and
  likely cause an attenuation of the true effect not create an artificial effect when
  none existed.
- In addition, the lower levels of selenium in foods in Sweden may limit the generalizability
  of our results as other populations are naturally exposed to higher levels of selenium
  through the food supply.
- Furthermore, while dietary supplement use, including selenium supplementation, was
  not common among our population in 1987, current supplement use in other populations
  is likely higher which may also limit the generalizability of our results.
- Another limitation of our study was for the majority of our participants, we only
  had a pre-diagnosis assessment of diet and thus could not examine diet post-diagnosis
  during the follow-up period.
- While studies among women with breast cancer have indicated that 30–40 % report
  dietary change following diagnosis, the main changes reported were an increase in
  fruit and vegetable consumption and a decrease in meat consumption [36, 37].
- However, fruit and vegetables were not primary contributors to selenium intake in
  our population while meat consumption contributed to approximately 11 % of dietary
  selenium intake.
- In addition, among a cohort of breast cancer patients in the U.K., no change in
  selenium intake pre- to post-diagnosis was observed [38].
- In our study, up to 85 % of women who completed a FFQ post-diagnosis remained in
  the same or adjacent quartile of selenium intake following diagnosis.
- Residual or unmeasured confounding by healthy lifestyle characteristics such as
  physical activity or other dietary factors is a possibility.
- However, we adjusted for a variety of potential confounders with minimal change
  in our effect estimates.
- We also adjusted for physical activity in the subset of breast cancer cases with
  this information and the association did not materially change.
- Additional adjustment for the foods that were the highest contributors to selenium
  did not materially change the effect estimates.
- Finally, we cannot rule out that the results may be because of chance.
- To our knowledge, this is the largest study to examine the association between dietary
  selenium intake and mortality with 964 total deaths including 416 breast cancer
  deaths which allowed us the power to not only evaluate breast cancer–specific mortality
  but also whether the association differed by tumor hormone receptor status or other
  potential effect modifiers.
- Strengths also include a prospective population-based cohort design, complete follow-up
  of all cases, long follow-up period, detailed information on diet, and data on many
  important covariates, including clinical and lifestyle characteristics.
- In conclusion, we observed that selenium intake before breast cancer diagnosis may
  improve breast cancer–specific survival and overall survival.
- These findings may be limited to populations with low intakes of selenium.
