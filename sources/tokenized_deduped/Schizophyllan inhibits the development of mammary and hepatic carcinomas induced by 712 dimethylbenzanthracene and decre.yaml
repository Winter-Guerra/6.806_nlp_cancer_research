- Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer mortality among women.
- Some anticancer compounds have been isolated from mushrooms.
- The aim of the present work was to study the anticancer effects of schizophyllan
  (SCH), a β-d-glucan extracted from the mushroom _Schizophyllum commune_ alone or
  in combination with tamoxifen (TAM) on 7, 12 Dimethylbenz(α)anthracene (DMBA)-induced
  carcinomas in mice.
- We isolated SCH from _S.
- commune_.
- Female mice received DMBA, SCH, DMBA+SCH, DMBA+TAM or DMBA+TAM+SCH or vehicles.
- We studied mice survival, tumour incidence, histopathology, oestrogen receptor (ER)
  expression, cell proliferation by immunohistochemical detection of proliferating
  cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), apoptosis by TUNEL assay, as well as caspase-3 expression.
- DMBA treatment resulted in mammary and hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC).
- Both SCH and TAM reduced the incidence of DMBA-induced mammary tumours by 85 and
  75 %, respectively, and equally decreased the PCNA labelling index relative to DMBA.
- TAM treatment increased the incidence of- and PCNA index in HCCs relative to DMBA,
  while SCH suppressed these effects.
- TAM was more effective than SCH in the induction of apoptosis in both mammary and
  hepatic carcinomas.
- Caspase-3 levels correlated with the apoptotic index in most experimental groups.
- Only one dose of SCH had similar therapeutic effects against DMBA-induced mammary
  carcinomas as 4 weeks of TAM treatment.
- This coupled with the ability of SCH to suppress hepatic lesions associated with
  TAM treatment provides the rationale for further investigating the combined therapeutic
  effects of TAM+SCH in preclinical models of ER-positive breast cancer, as well as
  in liver cancer.

  Breast cancer is the most common malignancy among women and is still today one of
  the leading causes of cancer mortality despite the development of improved diagnostic
  tools and novel therapeutic modalities.'
- Treatment options for breast cancer patients include surgery, radiation therapy,
  chemotherapy and targeting therapies, such as drugs targeting the oestrogen receptor
  (ER), epidermal growth factor signalling pathway and a number of other kinases (Di
  Cosimo and Baselga 2008).
- Tamoxifen (TAM) is widely used as a first-line endocrine therapy for breast cancer
  patients with positive ER and as a chemoprophylactic agent for women at high risk
  of developing this disease (Fisher et al.
- 1998).
- Besides the significant benefit, long-term administration of TAM has serious adverse
  effects; including endometrial cancer in women (Killackey et al.
- 1985; Bernstein et al.
- 1999).
- Therefore, alternative therapies with minimal side effects are required.
- Several anticancer compounds have been isolated from herbs or fungi such as mushrooms.
- In general, medicinal mushrooms have been shown to improve cardiovascular health,
  stimulate immune function and contribute to glucose homoeostasis and to modulate
  detoxification, as well as exert antiallergic, antiviral, antibacterial, antifungal
  and anti-inflammatory activities (Martin and Brophy 2010).
- In addition, polysaccharides from mushrooms have exhibited anticancer activities.
- The bioactive polysaccharides isolated from mushroom fruit bodies, submerged cultured
  fungal biomass, or liquid culture fermentation broths are either β-d-glucans or
  β-d-glucan–protein complexes (proteoglycans) (Bohn and BeMiller 1995).
- A small number have progressed to clinical trials mainly in Japan and China such
  as lentinan (_Lentinus edodes_), schizophyllan (SCH) (_Schizophyllum commune_),
  PSK and PSP (_Trametes versicolor_) and Grifron-D (_Grifora frondosa_) (Sullivan
  et al.
- 2006).
- In almost all cases, the polysaccharides are used as adjuvant treatments with conventional
  chemotherapy/radiotherapy with many forms of cancer.
- Their incorporation into treatment regimens significantly reduced the side effects
  so often encountered by patients.
- Although the exact molecular mechanism of their antitumour action is still not fully
  known, these polysaccharides are suggested to enhance the immune responses in vivo
  and act as biological response modifiers (Ooi and Liu 2000).
- SCH from the inedible mushroom _S.
- commune_ (Mwt ~450 kD), known as split-gill mushroom, is a highly potent antitumour
  polysaccharide that inhibits solid Sarcoma 180 tumour when injected by intraperitoneal
  or intravenous route, but has low antitumour activity by subcutaneous route (Komatsu
  et al.
- 1969).
- In humans, it was found ineffective against gastric cancer, but extended survival
  in patients with head and neck cancer (Kimura et al.
- 1994; Borchers et al.
- 1999).
- To our knowledge, the efficacy of SCH in the treatment for breast cancer has not
  been studied before; hence, the present work was conducted to study the potential
  anticancer effect of SCH alone or in combination with TAM on 7, 12 Dimethylbenz(α)anthracene
  (DMBA)-induced carcinogenesis in mice.
- DMBA-treated mice developed both mammary- and hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC).
- An imbalance between proliferation and apoptosis may lead to tumourigenesis.
- Therefore, in the present study, we investigated the effect of SCH on the incidence
  of both mammary and hepatic tumours, on the levels of proliferating cell nuclear
  antigen (PCNA) as a marker of cell proliferation, on apoptosis, as well as on the
  expression of caspase-3, a central protein in the execution of apoptosis.
- In the current study, both SCH and TAM alone or in combination decreased mammary
  tumour incidence through reducing cell proliferation; however, TAM was more effective
  than SCH in the induction of apoptosis, which was coupled with an increase in caspase-3
  levels.
- Interestingly, TAM increased the HCC incidence in DMBA+TAM-treated mice in comparison
  with DMBA-treated mice and this was associated with an increase in PCNA labelling
  index in HCCs.
- In contrast, SCH reduced the incidence of HCCs in DMBA+SCH- and DMBA+TAM+SCH-treated
  mice, which was accompanied by a reduction in cellular proliferation.
- In addition, SCH increased the percentage of apoptotic cells and the levels of caspase-3
  expression in HCCs from DMBA- or DMBA+TAM-treated mice but not in normal liver.
- _Schizophyllum commune_ was collected from a local forest in La Crosse, Wisconsin,
  USA, and maintained in culture.
- Slants were incubated at 28 °C for 4 days and stored at 5 °C.
- Petri dishes were inoculated with 1 cm² of mycelia from slants at room temperature
  (RT).
- The culture was grown on potato dextrose agar slants at 28 ± 2 °C for 7 days.
- A 1 cm2 of mycelia along with agar from such slants were used to inoculate 50 ml
  of sterile seed culture medium, which was incubated at 28 ± 2 °C for 3 days on a
  rotary shaker.
- Polysaccharides were extracted by fermentation.
- _S.
- commune_ was screened for SCH production using the media reported by (Rau et al.
- 1992).
- Based on the initial screening, _S.
- commune_ was selected for further studies.
- The extraction and purification of polysaccharides from mushroom fruit bodies and
  mycelia were carried out according to the method of (Chihara et al.
- 1970).
- Briefly, fresh mushroom fruit bodies or mycelia (1 kg) were washed with water and
  boiled in 5 L of distilled water for 8–15 h. The suspension was then centrifuged
  to remove the insoluble matter.
- The aqueous extract was concentrated under reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator
  to the point where a slight turbidity was observed.
- The polysaccharide was obtained by precipitation with an equal volume of absolute
  ethanol.
- The fibrous like precipitate was left overnight at 4 °C, collected by centrifugation,
  washed with absolute ethanol, freeze-dried and then weighed.
- Ultraviolet and infrared absorptions were determined according to the methods described
  by (Fujii et al.
- 1978) (data not shown).
- The ¹H and ¹³C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was performed according
  to the method described by (Abraham and Loftus 1978) in which the polysaccharide
  sample (50 mg) was dissolved in one millilitre of concentrated dimethylsulfoxide
  (DMSO) by ultrasonication for 10–15 min.
- The solution was then introduced into a precision ground tube (5 mm diameter, depth
  2–3 cm) and measured.
- NMR spectra were obtained using a 500 MHz JEOL spectrometer (Japan).
- Female adult swiss albino mice (_Mus musculus_) with a mean weight of 25 g at the
  beginning of the experiment were obtained from the animal house at the Faculty of
  Medicine (Alexandria University, Egypt).
- Principles of laboratory animal care “NIH publication Np.
- 85-23, revised 1985” were followed, as well as the guidelines of animal experiments
  of Alexandria University’s research ethics committee.
- Five animals were housed per cage and kept on standard diet (mouse chow) and water
  ad libitum_,_ 22 °C RT, 50 ± 10 % humidity and 12-h light/dark cycle.
- The animals were divided into six groups, each containing 20 mice.
- Neoplastic mammary lesions were induced in mice by administering DMBA (Sigma-Aldrich,
  St. Louis, USA) (40 mg/kg) once/week for 4 weeks in 0.1 mL of sesame oil using oral
  gavage.
- Mice were divided into the following groups as shown in Fig.
- '1: Group 1 received only DMBA and group 2 received only SCH (4 mg/kg, intraperitoneal
  [i.p.])'
- in saline once at the beginning of the experiment.
- 'Group 3 was divided into two subgroups: group 3a received both DMBA and SCH at
  the beginning of the experiment and group 3b was treated first with DMBA as in group
  1; then, after the appearance of palpable tumours, they received one dose of SCH
  (4 mg/kg, i.p.).'
- Group 4 received TAM (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA) (8 mg/kg/day) in 0.1 mL sesame
  oil per oral (p.o.)
- for 4 weeks after the appearance of tumours (DMBA+TAM).
- Group 5 received both TAM+SCH after the appearance of tumours (DMBA+TAM+SCH).
- Group 6 was divided into two subgroups, which received vehicles (saline and sesame
  oil) to serve as negative controls for SCH (saline) and DMBA or TAM (oil), respectively
  (Fig.
- 1).
- 'Experimental groups mice were divided into six groups: _group 1_ was treated with
  DMBA at a dose of 40 mg/kg once/week for 4 weeks in 0.1 mL of sesame oil using oral
  gavage, _group 2_ was injected intraperitoneal with SCH at a dose of 4 mg/kg only
  once at the beginning of the experiment.'
- '_Group 3_ was divided into two subgroups: _group 3a_ received both DMBA and SCH
  at the beginning of the experiment and _group 3b_ was treated first with DMBA as
  in _group 1_ then after the appearance of palpable tumours mice received one dose
  of SCH (4 mg/kg).'
- _Group 4_ received both DMBA as in _group 1_ and TAM at a dose of 8 mg/kg/day in
  0.1 mL sesame oil per oral for 4 weeks, _group 5_ received DMBA+TAM+SCH, while_
  group 6_ was divided into two subgroups, which received saline (_6a_) and sesame
  oil (_6b_).
- 'All the animals were killed after 20 weeks from the first DMBA dose




  Upon necroscopy, mammary and liver tissues and tumours were removed and immediately
  sliced and fixed in 10 % neutral buffered formalin.'
- The tissues were processed, embedded in paraffin and sectioned at 5 μm thickness.
- The sections were mounted on glass slides and stained with haematoxylin and eosin
  (H&amp;E) for histopathological evaluation.
- Detection of apoptotic cells in tissue sections was performed using the Terminal
  deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated d-UTP Nick End Labelling (TUNEL) assay
  (Apoptosis TUNEL assay IHC kit, AbD Serotec, MorphoSys, Oxford, UK, cat.no.
- APO002) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
- The number of apoptotic cells was measured according to the number of positive cells
  as well as by morphologic assessment (Garrity et al.
- 2003).
- The apoptotic index was calculated as the number of positive cells/total number
  of positive and negative cells 100× in five different fields per section.
- For immunohistochemical analysis, formalin-fixed tissue sections were mounted onto
  coated slides and rehydrated.
- Antigen retrieval was performed by boiling the slides in 2 mg/L citrate buffer.
- The slides were then left to cool to RT, and sections were washed in phosphate-buffered
  saline (PBS) and left to equilibrate.
- Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by incubating the sections in 3 % solution
  of H2O2 in PBS for 10 min.
- After washing 3 times in PBS, nonspecific reactivity was blocked by incubation with
  protein blocker for 5 min.
- 'The sections were then incubated with the following monoclonal antibodies: against
  PCNA (PC10, AM252-5ME, Biogenex Life Sciences, USA), against caspase-3 (CPP32) Ab-3
  (clone 3CSP 03) (Thermo scientific, Fremont, CA, USA) and against ERα (RM-9101-S0)
  (clone SP1) overnight at 4 °C.'
- Sections were then left at RT for 1 h after which they were incubated with the secondary
  antibody for 30 min at RT.
- The UltraVision ONE detection system with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) Polymer and
  DAB Plus Chromogen (Thermo Scientific, Fremont, CA, USA) was used, and sections
  were counterstained with haematoxylin, mounted and examined.
- For the verification of the specificity of the immunostaining, the primary antibodies
  were substituted with their diluting solution on some sections to serve as negative
  controls.
- Scoring was performed according to (Allred et al.
- 1998).
- 'For quantitative analysis of the PCNA or caspase-3 positivity, we measured PCNA
  or caspase-3/Labelling index (LI) as follows: at least 6 fields per section were
  photographed (400×).'
- Positive and negative cells were counted in each field.
- We calculated PCNA/LI or caspase-3/LI as the number of positive cells/total number
  of positive and negative cells.
- Data were analysed and expressed as means ± SD.
- Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS statistical package version 16.00
  (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois, USA).
- The differences between groups were analysed using one-way analysis of variance
  (ANOVA) followed by Fisher Least Significant Difference (LSD) test.
- The Kruskal–Wallis test was used for nonparametric data, and the Mann–Whitney test
  was then used for intergroup comparisons.
- A _p_ value ≤ 0.05 was considered significant.
- In the present study, polysaccharides (Schizophyllan) were extracted and purified
  from _S.
- commune_.
- The primary structure of the extracted substance identified using different spectroscopic
  techniques was found to be β-glucan.
- The 1H NMR spectra exhibited signals at different resonance, which represented the
  β-anomeric proton and protons of the different hydroxyl groups (Supplementary Fig.
- 1a, c).
- The 13C NMR spectrum revealed signals that are characteristic to glucan; the presence
  of 6 carbon atoms (Supplementary Fig.
- 1b).
- In the present study, while SCH was found to significantly increase mice’s survival
  in comparison with control mice receiving vehicle (oil or saline) (_p_ &lt; 0.002,
  0.003; respectively), it did not significantly alter the survival of mice, which
  received DMBA or DMBA and TAM, that is, those harbouring tumours.
- On the other hand, DMBA alone or DMBA+TAM or DMBA+TAM+SCH decreased the survival
  of mice significantly in comparison with control mice receiving vehicle (saline
  or oil) at _p_ &lt; 0.000 (Fig.
- 2).
- Effect of schizophyllan on mice survival SCH significantly increased mice’s survival
  in comparison with control mice receiving vehicle (_oil_ or _saline_) (_p_ &lt;
  0.002, 0.003; respectively); however, it did not significantly alter the survival
  of mice receiving DMBA or DMBA and TAM.
- 'Treatment of mice either with DMBA alone, DMBA+SCH, DMBA+TAM or DMBA+TAM+SCH decreased
  animals’ survival significantly in comparison with control and SCH-treated animals._

  To evaluate the anticancer potential of SCH in vivo, we first induced mammary tumours
  in female mice using DMBA.'
- Beginning 4 weeks after the last DMBA dose, mice began to develop palpable tumours.
- We euthanized mice whenever they showed signs of morbidity or when found dead.
- After 20 weeks from the beginning of DMBA treatment, we euthanized the remaining
  mice for analysis.
- While 75 % of DMBA-treated mice developed mammary tumours (group 1), administration
  of SCH alone before (group 3a) or after (group 3b) the induction of mammary tumours
  by DMBA resulted in substantial reduction in tumour incidence (from 75 to 15 %).
- Since SCH had the same effect on tumour incidence whether administered before or
  after the appearance of tumours, we, herewith, refer to subgroups 3a and 3b collectively
  as (DMBA+SCH).
- Treatment with TAM alone was found to reduce the tumour incidence to 25 % (group
  4).
- Combining SCH with TAM was found to further decrease the mammary tumour incidence
  to 15 % (group 5) in comparison with TAM alone (25 %).
- SCH-treated mice (group 2) did not develop any tumours similar to the control mice,
  which received vehicle only (group 6a, b) (Fig.
- 3a).
- Mammary tumour incidence and histopathology (a) neither the control nor the SCH-treated
  mice developed any mammary tumours, whereas 75 % of DMBA-treated mice developed
  mammary tumours.
- TAM alone reduced the mammary tumour incidence in DMBA-treated mice to 25 %, while
  TAM in combination with SCH or SCH alone further decreased the mammary tumour incidence
  to 15 %.

  ERα




  In the present study, no pathological changes were detected either in mammary tissue
  of control or in SCH-treated mice (Fig.'
- 3b, c).
- Treatment with DMBA resulted in varying degrees of epithelial hyperplastic changes
  ranging from mild to atypical changes including ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)
  (Fig.
- 3d), lobular carcinoma in situ (Fig.
- 3e) and infiltrating ductal carcinoma (IDC).
- Mammary glands from mice treated with DMBA+SCH or with DMBA+TAM+SCH still showed
  epithelial hyperplastic changes such as atypical ductal hyperplasia (Fig.
- 3f) and DCIS.
- In the DMBA+TAM-treated group, similar pathological changes to those induced by
  DMBA including IDC (Fig.
- 3g) were detected.
- All mammary tumours induced by DMBA were ERα-positive.
- A representative section of DMBA-treated mouse mammary gland immunostained with
  ERα and its negative control are shown in (Fig.
- 3h, i), respectively.
- We next studied the effect of SCH and TAM on cellular proliferation by immunostaining
  of PCNA in the mammary glands of control and treated mice.
- In control and SCH-treated mice, PCNA was localized in the ductal epithelial cell
  nuclei (Fig.
- 4a, b).
- The localization and intensity of the signal were similar in both control and SCH-treated
  mice.
- The mammary tumours from all the DMBA-treated groups showed a significant increase
  in the number of PCNA-positive cells.
- Representative sections from the mammary tumours induced in DMBA+TAM and DMBA+TAM+SCH-treated
  mice are shown in (Fig.
- 4c, d).
- The PCNA signal was localized in the tumour cells in addition to the ductal epithelial
  cells as shown in a section of the high-grade ductal carcinoma from a DMBA+TAM+SCH-treated
  mouse shown in (Fig.
- 4d).
- The number of PCNA-positive cells was counted in the mammary glands of all groups
  in six different fields, and the PCNA labelling index (LI) was calculated as described
  in the “Materials and methods”.
- The results are presented in (Table 1 and Fig.
- 4e).
- Treatment with DMBA significantly increased the PCNA/L1 score to about 8.4-fold
  of that of control animals (Fig.
- 4e).
- In contrast, SCH did not have a significant effect on the PCNA signal in comparison
  with control mice.
- However, treatment with either SCH alone or TAM alone or in combination significantly
  reduced the PCNA/L1 values by approximately 60 % in all treated groups (DMBA+SCH,
  DMBA+TAM, DMBA+TAM+SCH) in comparison with the DMBA-treated group (Table 1; Fig.
- 4e).

  In the present work, we studied apoptosis in the mammary glands in situ using TUNEL
  assay (Table 2 and Fig.'
- 5).
- The percentage of apoptotic cells was equal in the mammary glands from both normal
  and SCH-treated mice (0.5 %) (Table 2; Fig.
- 5a, b, g).
- Treatment of mice with DMBA alone increased the apoptotic index significantly by
  11.5-fold in comparison with control (Table 2; Fig.
- 5c, g).
- Treatment with either DMBA+SCH, DMBA+TAM or DMBA+TAM+SCH also significantly increased
  the apoptotic index by 7.5-, 31-, and 40-fold that of control mice (Table 2; Fig.
- 5d, e, f, g).
- This indicated that in DMBA+TAM-treated mice, TAM increased the apoptotic index
  significantly by 2.7-fold that induced by DMBA.
- Interestingly, combined treatment of SCH and TAM further increased the apoptotic
  index by 3.5-fold that induced by DMBA.
- Furthermore, the increase in apoptosis was associated with an increase in caspase-3
  expression levels in most experimental groups in comparison with control (Supplementary
  Fig.
- 2a).

  In the present study, liver sections from control or SCH-treated mice showed no
  pathological changes (Fig.'
- 6a, b).
- Mice treated with DMBA developed HCC in addition to the mammary tumours.
- Forty-five per cent of the analysed mice developed HCC (Fig.
- 6i) that were well (Fig.
- 6c) or poorly differentiated.
- The remaining mice showed varying degrees of pathological changes such as foci of
  small cell dysplastic lesions that were more evident in the periportal acinar zone
  1.
- Ductular reaction was also observed.
- (Fig.
- 6d).
- The administration of TAM to DMBA-treated mice increased the severity of hepatic
  lesions.
- Fifty-five per cent of DMBA+TAM-treated mice developed HCC (Fig.
- 6i), mostly were well developed with a trabecular pattern and evidence of bile production.
- Other hepatic lesions induced by TAM included centrilobular canalicular cholestasis
  (Fig.
- 6e), steatohepatitis, which was observed in about 30 % of mice (Fig.
- 6f), as well as increasing fibrosis.
- The mice receiving DMBA+TAM+SCH displayed similar histopathological changes as in
  the DMBA+TAM group such as steatohepatitis, small cell dysplastic lesions, cirrhosis
  (Fig.
- 6g) and HCCs; however, these lesions appeared less severe and less numerous.
- HCC was detected in 35 % of the mice in this group (Fig.
- 6i).
- Group 3 that received SCH either before or after the appearance of mammary tumours
  still developed HCC and dysplastic foci, but were less numerous than those in the
  DMBA, DMBA+TAM and DMBA+TAM+SCH groups.
- Dysplastic foci detected in the liver of these mice are shown in (Fig.
- 6h).
- HCC was detected in about 30 % of the DMBA+SCH mice.
- The percentage of mice harbouring HCC in the different experimental groups is shown

- 'TAM alone increased the HCC incidence in DMBA-treated mice to 55 %, while SCH alone
  or in combination with TAM decreased the HCC incidence to 30, and 35 %, respectively




  In the present study, PCNA-positive cells were detected in the liver from all control
  and treated mice (Fig.'
- 7).
- PCNA was localized in the nuclei of hepatocytes in normal and SCH-treated mice (Fig.
- 7a, b) and in malignant cells in DMBA-induced HCC (Fig.
- 7c, d).
- The PCNA-positive cells were counted, and the PCNA/LI was determined as described
  in materials and methods and the results are presented in (Table 3, Fig.
- 7e).
- As in the mammary glands, SCH did not induce any changes in the PCNA/LI in comparison
  with control (Table 3, Fig.
- 7b, e).
- In contrast, the DMBA-induced HCC displayed a 3.1-fold increase in the number of
  PCNA/Ll in comparison with control liver.
- Interestingly, TAM had a synergistic effect with DMBA, and tumour cells from DMBA+TAM-treated
  mice had a 5.2-fold increase in PCNA/LI relative to the normal cells (170 % increase
  in comparison with the PCNA/LI value in HCCs from DMBA-treated mice) (Table 3, Fig.
- 7e).
- HCCs from DMBA+TAM+SCH-treated mice showed a significant reduction in the PCNA/LI
  by 52 % in comparison with the value in DMBA+TAM-treated mice (Table 3, Fig.
- 7e).
- Similarly, when SCH was administered to DMBA-treated mice either before or after
  the appearance of tumours the PCNA/LI decreased significantly by 42 % (Table 3,
  Fig.
- 7e).
- The timing of SCH administration did not have a statistically significant effect
  on the PCNA/LI.
- These results clearly indicate that while DMBA and TAM increased cell proliferation,
  administration of SCH significantly reduced this effect.

  In the liver, treatment of mice with SCH did not have a significant effect on the
  percentage of apoptotic cells detected by TUNEL assay in comparison with normal
  cells (Table 4; Fig.'
- 8a, b, g).
- However, DMBA increased the apoptotic index by 1.2-fold the value in normal liver
  (Table 4; Fig.
- 8c, g).
- Administration of SCH to DMBA-treated mice increased the apoptotic index by 1.2-fold
  in comparison with that induced by DMBA alone (Table 4; Fig.
- 8d, g).
- The apoptotic index was further significantly increased in HCCs from DMBA+TAM- or
  DMBA+TAM+SCH-treated mice almost equally (about twofold), in comparison with that
  induced by DMBA (Table 4; Fig.
- 8 e, f, g).
- This indicates that the administration of SCH alone or TAM alone or in combination
  into DMBA-treated mice significantly increased the percentage of apoptotic cells
  in HCCs.
- Caspase-3 levels were also increased in HCCs from DMBA- and DMBA+TAM-treated mice
  by 1.3-fold the value of control and in HCCs from DMBA+SCH or DMBA+TAM+SCH by 2.5-fold
  the value of control (Supplementary Fig.

  Dietary mushroom and extracts from medicinal mushrooms have been shown to possess
  antitumour activities in vitro and in vivo (Yu et al.'
- 1993; Wu et al.
- 2007; Zhang et al.
- 2009; Shin et al.
- 2010).
- The effect of the inedible mushroom _S.
- commune_ on mammary cancer in experimental animals has not been published before
  but a study by (Zhang et al.
- 2009) reported that dietary intake of fresh mushrooms or dried mushroom powder significantly
  decreased breast cancer in pre- and postmenopausal women.
- In another study, 69 % of breast cancer patients consuming whole maitake mushroom
  powder showed significant cancer regression (Kodama et al.
- 2002).
- In the present study, we demonstrated that schizophyllan (SCH), a β-d-glucan extracted
  from _S.
- commune_, markedly reduced the incidence of mammary and hepatic carcinomas and decreased
  cell proliferation in a mouse model of DMBA-induced carcinogenesis.
- We also compared the antitumour effects of SCH to those of tamoxifen (TAM).
- In the present study, DMBA induced ER-positive mammary tumours.
- This is in agreement with previous studies showing that DMBA-induced mammary tumours
  in the rat are essentially similar in morphology, pathogenesis and ER status to
  human breast cancer and show oestrogen-dependent growth (Russo et al.
- 1990).
- In the current work, although mice received only one dose of SCH, it was sufficient
  to reduce the mammary tumour incidence from 75 % in DMBA-treated mice to 15 % in
  the groups that received SCH (DMBA+SCH and DMBA+TAM+SCH).
- The timing of SHC administration whether before or after the appearance of tumours
  did not differ significantly regarding its effect on tumour incidence or any other
  biological effect.
- In comparison, administration of TAM alone (8 mg/kg/day) for 4 weeks into DMBA-treated
  mice reduced the mammary tumour incidence to 25 %.
- This result indicates that one dose of SCH was more effective in reducing the mammary
  tumour incidence in this experimental model than daily administration of TAM for
  4 weeks.
- In the present study, DMBA induced varying degrees of epithelial hyperplastic changes
  in mammary tissue including both infiltrating ductal and lobular carcinoma and ductal
  carcinoma in situ (DCIS).
- Similar mammary lesions were detected in mice, which received DMBA+TAM, albeit with
  lower incidence.
- In contrast, DMBA-treated mice receiving SCH showed no infiltrating carcinomas;
  however, DCIS was detected in these mice.
- This may indicate that SCH slowed the progression of mammary carcinoma as it is
  known that in more than 50 % of cases, DCIS may progress to infiltrating carcinoma
  (Axelrod et al.
- 2006).
- Consistent with these findings, the polysaccharide fraction from maitake mushroom
  was found to hinder metastatic progression, reduce the expression of tumour markers
  and to increase natural killer cell activity in all breast cancer patients as reported
  by (Kodama et al.
- 2003).
- The powerful anticancer effect of one dose of SCH may be attributed to a long biological
  half-life of the compound.
- Consistent with this explanation, (Tokuyasu et al.
- 2010) reported high plasma concentration of β-d-glucan in a 69-year-old woman 18
  years after she was treated with SCH (also known as SPG) for cervical cancer.
- SPG has been used in combination with radiotherapy to improve the local response
  to radiation treatment for cervical cancer (Noda et al.
- 1992).
- In rats, SPG in the liver is degraded over a period of 6 months to SPG-like substances
  and it is metabolized in the spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes at a much slower
  rate, before it is finally excreted in the urine (Tanji et al.
- 1990).
- In humans, SPG could be detected in the body after almost 4 years from the last
  intramuscular injection (a total dose of 280 mg) (Ishizuka et al.
- 2004).
- Although the biological half-life of β-d-glucan remains unknown in humans, these
  reports suggest a long half-life for SCH.
- In the present study, SCH did not affect the survival of DMBA-treated mice but it
  significantly improved the survival of mice, which received SCH alone in comparison
  with control mice receiving vehicle, and it did not induce any pathological alterations
  in the mammary gland or liver.
- This is in agreement with a phase I study for the assessment of safety and tolerability
  of a soluble form of oral β-glucans (Lehne et al.
- 2006).
- β-glucans were given in different doses for 4 consecutive days, and no drug-related
  adverse effects were observed.
- In agreement with our finding, (Fujimoto et al.
- 1991) reported that the median survival time of 130 patients with resectable gastric
  cancer after 5 years of surgical removal of the whole tumour tissue in addition
  to the application of SCH, mitomycin and futraful was 72.2 % in comparison with
  61.9 % for 134 patients who received chemotherapy alone without SCH.
- However, SCH had no effect on the survival time when the tumour tissue could not
  be totally removed.
- In cervical cancer, SCH prolonged survival and time to recurrence for stage II but
  not stage III cases (Okamura et al.
- 1989; Miyazaki et al.
- 1995) and showed added effectiveness when injected directly into the tumour mass
  (Nakano et al.
- 1996).
- In a randomized trial, SPG combined with conventional chemotherapy improved the
  long-term survival rate of patients with ovarian cancer (Inoue et al.
- 1993).
- In the present study, although TAM reduced the incidence of DMBA-induced mammary
  tumours, mice receiving DMBA+TAM developed a higher percentage of HCC in comparison
  with those which received DMBA only.
- Our results are in agreement with previous findings that presented TAM as a potent
  hepatocarcinogen in rats (Greaves et al.
- 1993; Hard et al.
- 1993) with both tumour-initiating (Williams et al.
- 1997) and promoting properties (Dragan et al.
- 1996).
- Furthermore, TAM was found to promote mammary cancer development in a mouse model
  of Brca 1-mutation-related breast cancer (Jones et al.
- 2005).
- In humans, several side effects of TAM have been reported.
- In a Swedish trial using adjuvant TAM 40 mg/day for 2–5 years, 3 cases of liver
  cancer have been reported and one case was reported in the Breast Cancer Prevention
  Trial (BCPT, NSABP P-1).
- The NSABP P-1 was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled 5 years of Tamoxifen
  citrate therapy (20 mg/day) (Tamoxifen official FDA information, side effects and
  uses, http://​www.​drug.​com/​pro/​tamoxifen.​html).
- In the present study, TAM induced additional liver lesions such as steatohepatitis,
  cholestasis and cirrhosis.
- These results are consistent with previous studies in humans reporting the incidence
  of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis in female patients who received TAM (20 mg/day)
  (Akhondi-Meybodi et al.
- 2011) or 40 mg/day as postoperative endocrine treatment (Nemoto et al.
- 2002).
- In the current study, SCH could reduce the incidence of HCC in DMBA-treated mice
  from 45 to 30 % and in DMBA+TAM-treated mice from 55 to 35 %.
- As discussed below, the reduction in HCC incidence was associated with a significant
  reduction in PCNA labelling index and a slight but statistically significant increase
  in the apoptotic index coupled with an increase in the levels of caspase-3 protein.
- Therefore, the protective effect of SCH against “TAM-induced or promoted” liver
  lesions warrants further investigation.
- Our results demonstrated that both TAM and SCH equally decreased cell proliferation
  in mammary tumours.
- In agreement with our results, (Martin and Brophy 2010) reported that maitake, crimini,
  portabella, oyster and white button mushrooms significantly suppressed cellular
  proliferation with only maitake further inducing apoptosis in MCF-7 breast cancer
  cells.
- The inhibition of proliferation of ER-positive cells by TAM is already known and
  is attributed to the antagonism of ER by TAM and the subsequent inhibition of oestrogen-dependent
  proliferative events leading to growth arrest of ER-positive cells (Mandlekar et
  al.
- 2000).
- Our findings are, therefore, consistent with several previous reports.
- For example, de Sousa et al.
- (2006) demonstrated that TAM reduced the proliferation marker Ki-67 positivity in
  the breast epithelium of carcinoma patients treated with 10 mg TAM for 14 days (de
  Sousa et al.
- 2006).
- Earlier studies on cell lines revealed that TAM inhibits proliferation of MCF-7
  human breast cancer cells through a delay in G1 phase (Osborne et al.
- 1983).
- Furthermore, in the present study, while SCH decreased cell proliferation in HCCs,
  TAM increased it significantly in DMBA+TAM-treated mice in comparison with DMBA
  and combined treatment with SCH and TAM reduced the PCNA/LI by 50 % in comparison
  with that in mice treated with only TAM.
- Similar to our results, polysaccharides from _Lentinus edodes_ suppressed liver
  tumour growth in mice (Fu et al.
- 2011).
- The increase in cell proliferation by TAM may be attributed to the potential increase
  in gene expression of cell cycle genes such as _Ccnd1_ as was previously reported
  to be induced by TAM in early stages of liver carcinogenesis (Pogribny et al.
- 2007).
- Another study reported that the increase in cell proliferation in liver cells by
  TAM could be attributed to epigenetic reprogramming and prominent increase in the
  expression of the _c_-_myc_ proto-oncogene in female rats exposed to TAM (Tryndyak
  et al.
- 2007).
- In the same study, the authors also reported that TAM induced apoptosis in hepatocytes
  as indicated by a doubling of the number of TUNEL-positive cells (Tryndyak et al.
- 2007).
- This is consistent with our results.
- In the present study, DMBA induced apoptosis in both mammary and liver tumours,
  but more significantly in mammary tumours.
- DMBA-induced apoptosis was associated with an increase in caspase-3 positivity.
- Similar to our findings, Tsai-turton et al.
- (2007) showed that DMBA induced apoptosis in preovulatory follicles, which was mediated
  by reactive oxygen species and involved Bax and caspase-3 (Tsai-Turton et al.
- 2007).
- In further agreement with our results, earlier studies showed that DMBA induced
  apoptosis in the A20.1 murine B cell lymphoma (Burchiel et al.
- 1993), and in the adrenal cortex of female Sprague–Dawley rats, which was also associated
  with activation of caspase-3 (Fu et al.
- 2005).
- In the present study, TAM was generally more effective than SCH in the induction
  of apoptosis in both mammary and liver carcinomas, but combined treatment with DMBA+TAM+SCH
  increased the percentage of apoptotic cells in mammary carcinomas in comparison
  with that induced by DMBA+TAM alone.
- This may explain the reduced mammary tumour incidence in DMBA+TAM+SCH-treated mice
  (15 %) versus that in DMBA+TAM-treated mice (25 %).
- In the present study, the caspase-3 labelling index correlated with the apoptosis
  index in both mammary and liver tissues in the control, DMBA-, SCH- and DMBA+SCH-treated
  mice.
- Previous studies demonstrated that the water extract of Chaga mushroom (_Inonotus
  obliquus_) induced apoptosis associated with an upregulation of caspase-3 in HT-29
  colon cancer cells (Lee et al.
- 2009), and in melanoma cells in vitro and in vivo (Youn et al.
- 2009).
- In the mammary but not the liver tumours, caspase-3 positivity also correlated with
  the increase in apoptosis by DMBA+TAM.
- In partial agreement with our results, TAM has been shown before to induce apoptosis
  in breast cancer cells (Frankfurt et al.
- 1995), which was through the downregulation of bcl-2 without alterations in p53
  levels (Zhang et al.
- 1999).
- TAM has also been reported to induce apoptosis in HepG2, Hep1B, Hepa1-6 and MH1C1
  hepatoma cells, which was accompanied with an upregulation of caspase 3 and 8 activity,
  and increased p27, bax, caspase 3 expression (Herold et al.
- 2002).
- In the present study, TAM did not increase caspase-3 expression in HCCs but it did
  in mammary tumours.
- This may be attributed to the fact that there are two pathways that are responsible
  for TAM-induced apoptosis, one is ER-dependent, caspase-independent and resembles
  necrosis-like programmed cell death and the other is ER-independent and caspase-dependent
  (Obrero et al.
- 2002).
- In our experimental setting, the exact mechanism of TAM-induced apoptosis in liver
  versus mammary tumours requires further investigation.
- In spite of the use of mushrooms in clinical trials for cancer patients, particularly
  in the Far East, the molecular mechanism of their anticancer activity is still not
  fully understood.
- Two mechanisms have been proposed to be responsible for the anticancer action of
  herbs including mushroom; one via direct cytotoxic effect and the other is indirectly
  through immunomodulatory action (Borchers et al.
- 2004).
- It has been reported that polysaccharides from mushrooms are able to stimulate the
  nonspecific immune system and to exert antitumour activity through the stimulation
  of the host’s defence mechanism (Chihara et al.
- 1969).
- The drugs activate effector cells like macrophages, T lymphocytes and NK cells to
  secrete cytokines like TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-1β, which are antiproliferative and induce
  apoptosis and differentiation in tumour cells (Lindequist et al.
- 2005).
- It remains to be elucidated whether the inhibition of mammary tumour development
  by SCH is associated with a hormone effect.
- In conclusion, given the safety level of schizophyllan and its relative low cost,
  as well as its ability to inhibit mammary carcinomas similar to tamoxifen, and to
  suppress liver lesions associated with tamoxifen treatment, the present study provides
  the rationale for the use of schizophyllan in combination with tamoxifen in preclinical
  models and probably in clinical trials for oestrogen receptor-positive breast cancer
  therapy.
- The potential therapeutic value and mechanism of action of SCH deserve further investigation
  into other types of cancer including liver cancer.
