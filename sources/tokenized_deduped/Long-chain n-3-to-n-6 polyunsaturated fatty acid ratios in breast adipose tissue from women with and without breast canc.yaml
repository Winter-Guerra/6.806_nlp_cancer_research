- Animal studies suggest that dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) of the n-6
  class, found in corn and safflower oils, may be precursors of intermediates involved
  in the development of mammary tumors, whereas long-chain (LC) n-3 PUFAs, found in
  fish oil, can inhibit these effects.
- This case-control study was designed to examine the relationship between the PUFA
  composition of breast adipose tissue and the risk of breast cancer.
- Using fatty acid levels in breast adipose tissue as a biomarker of past qualitative
  dietary intake of fatty acids, we examined the hypothesis that breast cancer risk
  is negatively associated with specific LC n-3 PUFAs (eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic
  acid) and positively associated with n-6 PUFAs (linoleic acid and arachidonic acid).
- Breast adipose tissue was collected from 73 breast cancer patients and 74 controls
  with macromastia.
- The fatty acid levels were determined by gas-liquid chromatography.
- A logistic regression model was used to obtain odds ratio estimates while adjusting
  for age.
- The age-adjusted n-6 PUFA (linoleic acid and arachidonic acid) content was significantly
  higher in cases than in controls (P = 0.02).
- There was a trend in the age-adjusted data suggesting that, at a given level of
  n-6 PUFA, LC n-3 PUFAs (eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid) may have
  a protective effect (P = 0.06).
- A similar inverse relationship was observed with LC n-3-to-n-6 ratio when the data
  were adjusted for age (P = 0.09).
- We conclude that total n-6 PUFAs may be contributing to the high risk of breast
  cancer in the United States and that LC n-3 PUFAs, derived from fish oils, may have
  a protective effect.
