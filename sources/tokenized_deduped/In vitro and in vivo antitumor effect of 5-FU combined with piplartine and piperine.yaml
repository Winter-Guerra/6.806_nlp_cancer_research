- It has been reported that piplartine and piperine, alkaloid/amide compounds from
  _Piper_ species, show antitumor activities.
- In the present paper, the effects of the combination of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) with
  piplartine or piperine was determined using _in vitro_ and _in vivo_ experimental
  models.
- Hematological and biochemical analyses, as well as histopathological and morphological
  analyses of the tumor and the organs, including liver, spleen and kidney, were performed
  in order to evaluate the toxicological aspects associated with different treatments.
- The incubation of tumor cell lines with 5-FU in the presence of piplartine or piperine
  produced an increase in growth inhibition, as observed by lower IC50 values for
  5-FU.
- These effects were also observed _in vivo_, where the combination with piplartine
  but not piperine with 5-FU led to a higher tumor growth inhibition.
- The results indicated that either piplartine- or 5-FU-treated animals showed a low
  inhibition rate when they were used individually at low doses of 28.67% and 47.71%,
  respectively, but when they were combined at the same dose, the inhibition rate
  increased significantly to 68.04%.
- The histopathological analysis showed that the livers and the kidneys of treated
  animals were only slightly and reversibly affected.
- Neither the enzymatic activity of transaminases nor the urea levels were significantly
  modified when compared with the control group.
- Hematological analysis showed leukopenia after 5-FU treatment, which was reversed
  by the combined use of piplartine and piperine.
- These findings indicate that piplartine may enhance the therapeutic effectiveness
  of chemotherapeutic drugs, and moreover, this combination could improve immunocompetence
  hampered by 5-FU.
