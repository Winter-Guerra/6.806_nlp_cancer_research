- The long-term clinical usefulness of doxorubicin (DOX), an anthracycline with potent
  antitumor activity, is limited by DOX-induced cardiotoxicity.
- Kaempferol, one of the most common dietary flavonoids, is known to have anti-apoptotic,
  anti-oxidative, and anti-inflammatory properties.
- The current study aimed to investigate the possible protective effect of kaempferol
  against DOX-induced cardiotoxicity and the underlying mechanisms.
- Rats were intraperitoneally (i.p.)
- treated with DOX (3 mg/kg) every other day for a cumulative dose of 9 mg/kg.
- After 28 days, DOX caused retarded body and heart growth, oxidative stress, apoptotic
  damage, mitochondrial dysfunction, and Bcl-2 expression disturbance.
- In contrast, kaempferol pretreatment (10 mg/kg i.p.
- before DOX administration) attenuated the DOX-induced apoptotic damage in heart
  tissues.
- _In vitro_ studies also indicated that kaempferol may have used the mitochondrion-dependent
  pathway to counteract the DOX-induced cardiotoxicity.
- This counteraction was achieved by inhibiting p53 expression and its binding to
  the promoter region of the Bax proapoptotic gene, but not to the Bcl-2 antiapoptotic
  gene.
- Kaempferol also effectively suppressed DOX-induced extracellular signal-regulated
  kinase (ERK) 1/2 activation, but had no effect on p38 and JNK.
- Therefore, kaempferol protected against DOX-induced cardiotoxicity, at least, partially,
  by inhibiting the activation of p53-mediated, mitochondrion-dependent apoptotic
  signaling, and by being involved in an ERK-dependent mitogen-activated protein kinase
  pathway.
- These findings elucidated the potential of kaempferol as a promising reagent for
  treating DOX-induced cardiotoxicity, and may have implications in the long-term
  clinical usefulness of DOX.
