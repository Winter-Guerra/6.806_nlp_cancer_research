- In previous studies we observed that rhein lysinate (RHL), a salt of rhein and lysine
  that is easily dissolved in water, inhibited the growth of tumor cells in breast
  cancer, ovarian cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma and cervical cancer.
- The present study aimed to investigate the effects of RHL on H460 and A549 non‑small
  cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells using a combination of RHL and Taxol.
- A 3‑(4,5‑dimethylthiazol‑2‑yl)‑2,5‑diphenyl‑tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was
  used to determine the growth inhibition effect of the drugs in the H460 and A549
  cells.
- Cell apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry combined with fluorescein‑isothiocyanate‑Annexin
  Ⅴ/propidium iodide (PI) staining.
- The expression levels of proteins were detected by western blotting.
- There was a significant reduction in the proliferation of the NSCLC cell lines treated
  with a combination of Taxol and RHL.
- The overall growth inhibition was directly correlated with apoptotic cell death.
- RHL potentiated Taxol‑induced cell killing by reducing extracellular signal‑regulated
  kinase (ERK) activity and increasing the levels of cleaved poly(ADP‑ribose) polymerase
  (PARP) and caspase‑3.
- Notably, the results for the Bcl‑2 and NF‑κB proteins also showed downregulation
  in the combined treatment group compared with the single‑agent treatment and the
  untreated control groups.
- The present results showed that RHL potentiates the growth inhibition induced by
  Taxol in NSCLC cells and shoes that this synergy may be associated with the downregulation
  of ERK activation.
- Lung cancer is one of the most harmful malignant tumors to human health and life
  and its incidence is increasing every year, ranking first in large- and medium-sized
  cities in the incidence of malignant tumors (1,2).
- Two-thirds of patients are in the advanced stage when diagnosed with lung cancer
  and lose the opportunity for surgical treatment.
- Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) comprises 80% of all lung cancers.
- Chemotherapy is primarily used for the treatment of advanced lung cancer.
- Although new anticancer drugs and chemotherapies have been introduced, the outcomes
  for certain patients are not always satisfactory and patients become less able to
  tolerate treatment as the chemotherapy extends (3).
- Therefore, targeted therapy for lung cancer has become a research hotspot in recent
  years.
- Erlotinib and gefitinib are widely used in lung cancer therapy, although they are
  only effective for specific pathological situations and patients; the outcomes for
  the rest of the patients remain unsatisfactory.
- The issue of subsequent resistance to chemotherapy and the mechanisms involved have
  yet to be elucidated.
- Novel treatment strategies targeting this aggressive disease are expected to offer
  long-term disease control or possibly even a cure.
- Rhein, one of the major bioactive constituents of the rhizome of rhubarb (4,5),
  inhibits the proliferation of various human cancer cells (6–10).
- Our previous studies showed that rhein lysinate (RHL), a salt of rhein and lysine
  that is easily dissolved in water, exhibits anticancer activity in breast cancer,
  ovarian cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma and cervical cancer in vivo and in vitro
  (11–14).
- We previously showed that RHL was highly active in targeting the MEK/extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signal pathway and induced apoptosis and cell cycle
  arrest in human ovarian cancer cells (12).
- The present study aimed to determine whether RHL has additive or synergistic effects
  with Taxol and to determine the molecular mechanisms by which RHL enhances Taxol-induced
  cytotoxicity and apoptosis.

- The human lung carcinoma cell lines, H460 and A549, were obtained from the Cell
  Center of the Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences
  and Peking Union Medical College (Beijing, China).
- The cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Gibco BRL, Grand Island, NY, USA) supplemented
  with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO,
  USA), 2 mM glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37°C in
  a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2.
- Cell proliferation assays were performed using the MTT method, according to the
  manufacturer’s instructions.
- The cells were seeded in 96-well plates (Costar, Cambridge, MA, USA) with 2,500
  cells/well.
- Subsequent to overnight incubation, triplicate wells were treated with various concentrations
  of RHL for 48 h. Next, 20 μl MTT solutions (5 mg/ml in PBS) were added to each well
  and incubated for 4 h at 37°C.
- The MTT formazan was dissolved in 150 μl DMSO and the absorbance was measured with
  a microplate reader (Multiskan MK3; Thermo Labsystem, Waltham, MA USA) at a wavelength
  of 570 nm.
- The cells were collected and resuspended in 200 μl binding buffer, then 10 μl FITC-labeled
  enhanced Annexin V (Baosai Biotechnology Ltd., Beijing, China) and 100 ng propidium
  iodide (PI) were added.
- Upon incubation in the dark for 15 min at room temperature or 30 min at 4°C, the
  samples were diluted with 300 μl binding buffer.
- Flow cytometry was performed on a FACScan instrument (Becton-Dickinson, Franklin
  Lakes, NJ, USA) and the data were processed using WinMDI/PC-software.
- The cells were harvested and washed with PBS solution.
- The whole cellular extracts were prepared by incubating the cells on ice in lysis
  buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 2 mM EGTA, 1
  mM dithiothreitol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, protease inhibitors (1 mMPMSF, 5 μg/ml
  aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin and 5 μg/ml pepstatin) and phosphatase inhibitors (20
  mM β-glycerophosphate, 50 mM NaF and 1 mM Na3VO4).
- The supernatant was collected through centrifugation at 12,000 x g for 12 min.
- Protein concentrations were determined with the Bradford protein assay.
- Equal amounts of lysate (40 μg) were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene
  difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA, USA).
- The membranes were blocked in TBST containing 5% skim med milk at room temperature
  for 2 h and probed with primary antibodies overnight at 4°C.
- The membranes were then blotted with an appropriate horseradish peroxidase-linked
  secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.).
- Proteins were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence western blotting detection
  reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Inc., Piscataway, NJ, USA).
- The growth of the H460 and A549 cells treated with RHL (100 μmol/l), Taxol (1 μmol/l)
  or a combination of the two was determined via MTT assays.
- The dose used in the present study was selected based upon a preliminary dose escalation
  study.
- A significant reduction in growth was observed in the cells treated with RHL and
  Taxol in combination compared with treatment with RHL or Taxol alone (Fig.
- 1).
- The combined drug intoxication (CDI) value was &lt;0.7, indicating that the two
  drugs have a synergistic effect.
- The induction of apoptosis was observed in the lung cancer cells treated with either
  Taxol, RHL or a combination of the two.
- Relative to the single agents, the combined treatment induced more apoptosis in
  the two cell lines, as shown by flow cytometry combined with FITC-Annexin V/PI staining
  (Fig.
- 2).
- The ratios of apoptosis were 52.31 and 52.51% in the combined treatment groups,
  whereas the ratios of the Taxol groups were 18.98 and 18.86% in the H460 and A549
  cells, respectively.
- These results were consistent with the cell growth inhibition experiments using
  MTT, suggesting that the loss of viable cells due to RHL and Taxol treatment is
  partly due to the induction of an apoptotic cell death mechanism.
- In an attempt to investigate the mechanism of the enhanced apoptotic process induced
  by the treatment of the cells with RHL and Taxol, the levels of caspase-3 and PARP
  were assessed in the H460 and A549 cells.
- The results showed that the combined treatment was able to increase the levels of
  cleaved PARP and caspase-3 significantly.
- The results for the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and NF-κB proteins also showed downregulation
  in the combination group relative to the single-agent treatments and untreated control
  (Fig.
- 3).
- In the present study, it was observed that Taxol treatment enhanced the activation
  of ERK in the H460 and A5449 cells.
- However, Taxol in combination with RHL prevented the Taxol-induced ERK activation
  through the inhibition of MEK phosphorylation (Fig.
- 4).
- Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide despite
  advances in the field of cancer therapeutics (2).
- Traditional treatment with empirically selected cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents
  has provided small, but real survival benefits (2).
- Moreover, cancer recurrence and subsequent resistance to chemotherapy remain problematic
  and the mechanisms are not clear.
- New agents are required to offer long-term disease control or even possibly a cure.
- Advances and insights into the molecular pathogenesis of lung cancers have provided
  certain novel molecular targets, offering new strategies and agents that are tumor
  specific.
- Certain studies have demonstrated that tumor cells are able to produce resistance
  to Taxol by activating the MEK/ERK signal pathway.
- The activation of ERK was demonstrated to be important in mediating proliferation
  in cancer cells (15–18).
- Inhibiting MEK/ERK signaling may therefore enhance Taxol-induced cytotoxicity in
  lung cancer cells.
- Rhein, one of the major bioactive constituents of the rhizome of rhubarb (4,5),
  inhibits the proliferation of various human cancer cells (6–10).
- We previously demonstrated that RHL, a salt of rhein and lysine that is easily dissolved
  in water, has anticancer activity in breast cancer, ovarian cancer, cervical cancer
  and hepatocellular carcinoma in vivo and in vitro (11–14).
- We also showed that RHL was highly active in targeting the MEK/ERK signal pathway
  and that it induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in human ovarian cancer cells
  (12).
- In the present study, it was observed that RHL improved the anti-tumor activity
  of Taxol in lung cancer.
- Mechanically, RHL potentiated Taxol-induced cell killing by reducing the phosphorylation
  of ERK and increasing the levels of cleaved caspase-3 and PARP.
- These caspases belong to a family of cysteine proteases whose activation induces
  cellular apoptosis.
- Specifically, proteolytically cleaved caspase-3 and caspase-7, the active forms
  of pro-caspase-3 and pro-caspase-7, are key molecules for identifying the activation
  of apoptosis (19–21).
- In addition, PARP is one of the main substrates of activated caspase pathways and
  a well-established indicator of apoptotic cell death.
- The results for the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and NF-κB proteins also showed downregulation
  in the combined treatment group compared with the signal-agent treatment and untreated
  control groups.
- It is known that members of the Bcl-2 protein family act as key regulators of cellular
  apoptosis and are important determinants of cellular sensitivity or resistance to
  chemotherapy drugs (22–24).
- The overexpression of Bcl-2, an anti-apoptosis member of this family, is commonly
  observed in human lung cancer and Bcl-2 overexpression correlates with chemoresistance
  in this disease.
- In addition, NF-κB has been shown to inhibit apoptosis in response to chemotherapeutic
  agents.
- Compounds targeting the NF-κB pathway are able to sensitize lung tumor cells by
  counteracting resistance mechanisms, and therefore, deserve further evaluation with
  regard to chemotherapy and the possible chemoprevention of lung cancer (25–27).
- In conclusion, the present findings showed a synergistic effect between RHL and
  Taxol in certain lung cancer cell lines.
- This synergy is likely to be associated with the downregulation of ERK activation.
- Accordingly, further mechanistic studies may be useful in the treatment of patients
  with lung carcinoma.
- This study was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation
  of China (81001439) and the General Program of Natural Science Foundation of Hebei
  Province of China (H2012401030).
