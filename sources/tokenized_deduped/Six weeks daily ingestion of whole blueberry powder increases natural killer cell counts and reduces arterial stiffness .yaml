- Evidence suggests that berries contain bioactive compounds, which reduce certain
  cancers and hypertension.
- Our hypothesis was that daily blueberry (BB) consumption would increase natural
  killer (NK) cells and plasma redox capacity and reduce blood pressure, augmentation
  index (AIx), central pulse wave velocity, and aortic systolic pressures (ASPs).
- Twenty-five men and postmenopausal women aged 18 to 50 years were recruited and
  randomized to BB (n, 13) or placebo groups (n, 12).
- Participants were provided with BB (equivalent to 250 g berries) or placebo powders
  each day for 6 weeks.
- Blood pressure, vascular performance testing, and blood samples were taken at baseline
  (presupplementation).
- Participants returned after 6 weeks and repeated all procedures.
- Presupplementation to postsupplementation comparisons for the main effects of treatment,
  time, and treatment-time interaction were made using a 2 (treatment) × 2 (times)
  repeated-measures analysis of variance for all vascular measures, redox status,
  and NK cell counts.
- Anthropometric measures were compared using _t_ tests.
- Body mass, composition, and overall blood pressures were not affected in either
  group.
- Overall, AIx and ASPs were decreased in BB (treatment effect, _P_ = .024 and _P_
  = .046, respectively).
- Plasma redox was not affected.
- Absolute NK cells were increased in BB (time, _P_ = .001 and interaction, _P_ =
  .012).
- Subjects (n, 9) with prehypertensive pressures (≥120/80 mm Hg, respectively) were
  examined as a subset using _t_ tests and exhibited significant reductions in diastolic
  pressure (_P_ = .038) from presupplementation to postsupplementation in BB.
- We conclude that BB ingestion for 6 weeks increases NK cells and reduces AIx, ASP,
  and diastolic pressures in sedentary males and females.
