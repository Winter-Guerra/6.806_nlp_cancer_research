- ': Phenolic acids have been identified in a variety of legumes including lima bean,
  broad bean, common bean, pea, jack bean, goa bean, adzuki bean, hyacinth bean, chicking
  vetch, garbanzo bean, dral, cow bean, rice bean, mung bean and soybean.'
- 'The present study was carried out with the following aims: (1) to identify and
  quantify the individual phenolic acid and determine the total phenolic content (TPC);
  (2) to assess their antioxidant activity, inhibition activities of α-glucosidase,
  tyrosinase, and formation of advanced glycation endproducts; and (3) to investigate
  correlations among the phytochemicals and biological activity.'
- Common bean possesses the highest antioxidant activity and advanced glycation endproducts
  formation inhibition activity.
- Adzuki bean has the highest α-glucosidase inhibition activity, and mung bean has
  the highest tyrosinase inhibition activity.
- There are significant differences in phytochemical content and functional activities
  among the bean species investigated.
- Selecting beans can help treat diseases such as dermatological hyperpigmentation
  illness, type 2 diabetes and associated cardiovascular diseases.
- "legumes; antioxidant; α-glucosidase inhibition; advanced glycation endproducts;
  tyrosinase inhibition \n\n\n\nLegumes as a functional food ingredient have gained
  a lot of interest [1,2]."
- Proteins [3], saponins [4] and phenolic compounds [5] present in beans are active
  ingredients responsible for benefits associated with the consumption of beans.
- Phenolic compounds have been reported to reduce the risk of cancer, heart disease,
  and diabetes, as well as have antibacterial, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and anti-allergenic
  activities.
- Many of these benefits result from the antioxidant characteristics [6].
- Antioxidants refer to compounds possessing free radical-scavenging activity, transition
  metal-chelating activity, and/or singlet oxygen-quenching capacity [7,8].
- Several studies have suggested that the cells of diabetic patients are under oxidative
  stress with an imbalance between free radical-generating and radical-scavenging
  capacities.
- The increased free radical production and reduced antioxidant defense may partially
  mediate the initiation and progression of diabetes-associated complications [9,10].
- Acting as a key enzyme for carbohydrate digestion, intestinal α-glucosidase is one
  of the glucosidases located at the epithelium of the small intestine.
- α-Glucosidase has been recognized as a therapeutic target for modulation of postprandial
  hyperglycaemia, which is the earliest metabolic abnormality to occur in type 2 diabetes
  mellitus [11].
- Inhibition of intestinal α-glucosidases delays the digestion and absorption of carbohydrates,
  thereby suppressing postprandial hyperglycaemia [12].
- Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are part of a major pathogenic process in
  diabetic complications including neuropathy, nephropathy, retinopathy, atherosclerosis
  and cataracts [13].
- Thus, the discovery and investigation of AGE inhibitors would offer a potential
  therapeutic approach for the prevention of diabetic complications.
- Free radicals can up-regulate the mRNA level for tyrosinase, and amplify the production
  of melanin that correlates directly with serious problems in human skin [14].
- 'Acting as a key enzyme for synthesis of melanin pigments, tyrosinase catalyzes
  two distinct reactions in melanin synthesis: the hydroxylation of l-tyrosine to
  l-dopa and the oxidation of l-dopa to dopaquinone, after further series of conversions
  to the melanin produced [15].'
- The inhibitors of tyrosinase have been used to treat some dermatological hyperpigmentation
  illness connected with overproduction of melanin, which also play a significant
  role in the cosmetic business as a skin whitening agent [16].
- Phenolic acids have been reported in some legumes, however, there is still a lack
  of systematic study of diverse species beans on the relative abundance of total
  phenolic content (TPC), and their antioxidant, α-glucosidase inhibition, advanced
  glycation endproducts formation inhibition, and tyrosinase inhibition activities.
- Fifteen edible beans were grown in China in 2009.

  Inc., Torrance, CA).
- The wavelength of the UV detector was set at 280 nm.
- 'The mobile phase was a mixture of solvent A (HPLC water containing 0.05% TFA) and
  solvent B (acetonitrile: MeOH: TFA = 30:10:0.05).'
- 'The gradient elution was programmed as follows: from 10% to 12% B in 16 min; from
  12% to 25% B in 9 min; from 25% to 50% B in 25 min; from 50% to 75% B in 18 min;

  varying concentrations incubated with 100 μL of 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.0)
  in 96-well plates at 37 °C for 10 min.
- After preincubation, 50 μL of 5 mM p-nitrophenyl-α-d-glucopyranoside in a 0.1 M

- 'The results were expressed as a percent of α-glucosidase inhibition, and the inhibition
  activity was calculated according to the following equation: (Acontrol – Asample)/Acontrol
  × 100%.'
- BSA-glucose and BSA-MGO models were used for the evaluation of the inhibition effect
  of the extracts on the formation of advanced glycation end products.
- The BSA-glucose assay was carried out according the method reported by Peng and
  others [13].
- Briefly, 5 g of BSA and 14.4 g of d-glucose were dissolved in 1.5 M phosphate buffer
  (pH 7.4) to obtain the control solution with 50 mg/mL BSA and 0.8 M d-glucose.
- Two milliliters of the control solution was incubated at 37 °C for 7 days in the
  presence or absence of 1 mL of bean extracts in a 1.5 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4).
- After 7 days of incubation, fluorescent intensity (excitation at 330 nm and emission
  at 410 nm) was measured.
- 'Percent inhibition of AGE formation by each extract was calculated using the following
  equation: (1-(fluorescence of the solution with inhibitors/fluorescence of the solution
  without inhibitors)) × 100%.'
- The BSA-MGO assay was carried out according to the method reported by Yao and others
  [20].
- Briefly, 40 mg of BSA was mixed with 31 μL of MGO in a 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH
  7.4) to obtain the control solution with 1 mg/mL BSA and 5 mM MGO.
- Two milliliters of the control solution was incubated at 37 °C for 6 days with or
  without 1 mL of the bean extracts in phosphate buffer.
- The percent inhibition was calculated based on the equation applied in the BSA-glucose
  assay as described above (excitation at 340 nm and emission at 420 nm).
- The tyrosinase activity was determined as described previously [21].
- Assays were conducted in a 96-well microtiter plate and a plate reader was used

- Each well contained 40 μL of sample with 80 μL of phosphate buffer (0.1 M, pH 6.8),
  40 μL of tyrosinase (31 units/mL) and 40 μL of l-DOPA (2.5 mM), the samples were
  incubated for 30 min at 37 °C.
- Control had all the components except tyrosinase.
- 'The percentage tyrosinase inhibition was calculated as follows: (Acontrol – Asample)/Acontrol
  × 100%




  All values were expressed as mean ± SD.'
- Data were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey-Kramer
  test (Matlab version 7.6).
- Five phenolic acids (caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, p-coumaric acid, ferulic acid
  and sinapic acid) were found in those beans, the contents of individual phenolic
  acid in the different bean samples are shown in Table 2.
- It was found that ferulic acid was the dominant phenolic acid in all beans, the
  highest content was 26.06 ± 2.19 mg/100 g in common bean and the lowest one was
  9.10 ± 1.29 mg/100 g in garbanzo bean.
- The highest p-coumaric acid was found in common bean, 10.3 times higher than that
  in goa bean, which was the lowest among all the bean samples investigated in this
  study.
- It was also found that TPC as measured by Folin-Ciocalteu method varied widely in
  legumes.
- Phenolic compounds are considered as the major compounds that contribute to the
  total antioxidant activities of the grains [19].
- In the present study, common bean, with an average of 8.59 ± 0.11 mg GAE/g, was
  found to possess the highest TPC among all of the studied legumes and had 8.3 times
  greater than that of garbanzo bean (1.04 ± 0.24 mg GAE/g).
- Mung bean (8.14 mg GAE/g) had a high level of phenolics, this observation is in
  agreement with that of Peng et al [13]; they found that mung bean extract had the
  highest TPC among mung bean, black bean, soybean and cow bean.
- The antioxidant activities of legume extracts were evaluated by measuring their
  DPPH radical scavenging activities.
- All of the extracts exhibited strong antioxidant activities (Table 3), DPPH showed
  the same trends as did in TPC.
- Among the tested samples, common bean had the highest DPPH free radical scavenging
  activity (46.83 μM TE/g), whereas garbanzo bean had the lowest DPPH free radical
  scavenging activity (1.28 μM TE/g).
- Our results on DPPH in soybean (15.17 μM TE/g) were in agreement with that (18.44
  μM TE/g) reported previously [22], the results from garbanzo bean (1.28 μM TE/g)
  were in agreement with that (1.05–1.24 μM TE/g) of the previous report [23], while
  the other results from pea (31.92 μM TE/g), and common bean (46.83 μM were higher
  than respective values (2.25, 18.95 μM TE/g) in a previous report based on dry weight
  [22].
- Differences between our results and previous reports may be attributed partly to
  the differences in the sources of materials and in expressions based on dry weight
  or fresh basis calculation.
- It is difficult to compare our data to that reported by Amarowicz and Ronaldsince
  [24] as they were expressed in a different unit.
- It was found that TPC were highly correlated with their antioxidant activity (p
  &lt; 0.01).
- Similar effect was found in the study by Yao et al.
- '[19] who investigated seven color grains and found the antioxidant activity showed
  a positive correlation with their TPC.'
- Antioxidant activity of phenolics depends on the structure and substitution pattern
  of hydroxyl groups.
- p-Coumaric can exhibit competitive antioxidant activity because of the 4-position
  of hydroxylation on the phenolic ring and the additional conjugation in the propenoic
  side chain, which might facilitate the electron delocalization, by resonance, between
  the aromatic ring and propenoic group gives high antioxidant activity [25].
- Table 3 shows that adzuki bean had the highest α-glucosidase inhibition activity
  (64.33%), followed by the Goa bean (60.42%).
- Itoh et al.
- '[26] investigated the antidiabetic effects of azuki beans on streptozotocin (STZ)-induced
  diabetic rats, and they suggested that the active fraction of azuki beans suppresses
  the postprandial blood glucose by inhibiting α-glucosidase.'
- The inhibition in common bean, cow bean and rice bean was higher than 50%.
- α-Glucosidase inhibition was not statistically correlated with their phenolic acids
  and antioxidant activities of the extracts (Table 4).
- Mccue and others [27] investigated fifteen Asian beans, fruits and vegetables, and
  they concluded that a high phenolic content does not always confer a high inhibition
  of α-glucosidase activity of a food extract, which may be due to the nonphenolic
  compounds in the samples.
- The inhibition measured by BSA-glucose varied significantly among different beans
  (Table 3).
- Common bean had the highest inhibition (86.67%), followed by mung bean (74.84%).
- The inhibition measured by BSA-MGO showed the same trends as did BSA-glucose method.
- Common bean exhibited the highest inhibition (74.06%), followed by mung bean (72.67%).
- Beans have been recommended as suitable foods for diabetic patients in the past
  mainly based on their high fiber and protein contents [28].
- Recently, it has been reported that beans contained considerable bioactive phytochemicals,
  including phenolic compounds, which offer extra benefits for amelioration of diabetes
  and alleviating diabetic complications [29].
- The results (Table 4) obtained in our study showed that BSA-MGO and BSA-gluocose
  significantly correlate with TPC assay (p &lt; 0.05).
- Similar results have been observed by Peng and others [12] who investigated the
  correlation of the total phenolic content and inhibition effect of the phenolics
  on the formation of advanced glycation end products of mung bean, black bean, soybean
  and cowpea, and they demonstrated that phenolic compounds inhibit the formation
  of advanced glycation end products by inhibition of free radical generation in the
  glycation process and subsequent inhibition of protein modifications.
- In present study, mung bean with an average inhibition of 81.24%, had the highest
  tyrosinase inhibition activities among all the legumes and was 3.5 times higher
  than that of garbanzo bean (21.35%).
- Common bean (75.89%) also had a high level of inhibition.
- To our knowledge, this is the first report that edible beans have tyrosinase inhibition
  activities.
- The results showed that tyrosinase inhibition activity significantly correlates
  with TPC and DPPH assays (p &lt; 0.01) (Table 4).
- Gomez-Cordoves and others [30] reported phenolic fractions inhibit melanogenic activity
  in melanocytes and decrease colony forming of melanoma cells, which support their
  potential as therapeutic agents in the treatments of human melanoma.
- Melanogenesis is activated by oxidation related processes such as UV radiation.
- Melanogenesis requires tyrosinase activity and reactive species such as reactive
  oxygen and nitrogen species cause oxidative stress to the skin resulting in skin
  pigmentation and ageing [31].
- Hence, controlling oxidative stress is important for the regulation of melanogenesis,
  since the antioxidant may be closely related to anti-melanogenic actions and regulation
  of melanin synthesis [32].
- This was recently confirmed by Abdillahi [33] and Wu [34], where the anti-melanogenic
  activity of both Podocarpus and Taiwanese were attributed to their antioxidative
  actions.
- In summary, there are significant differences in phytochemical content and functional
  activities among the bean species investigated.
- Common bean appeared to possess the highest antioxidant activity, adzuki bean has
  the highest α-glucosidase inhibition and advanced glycation endproducts formation,
  and mung bean has the highest tyrosinase inhibition activity among all the beans
  tested.
- These results provide useful information when selecting bean species for better
  design of potential functional food that can treat diseases such as dermatological
  hyperpigmentation illness, type 2 diabetes and associated cardiovascular diseases.
- The present study was supported by the Institute Fund from The Ministry of Sciences
  and Technology, China (Yang Yao) and the earmarked fund for Modern Agro-industry
  Technology Research System (nycytx-018; Guixing Ren).
