  Lectins are proteins or glycoproteins of nonimmune origin that agglutinate cells
  and precipitate complex carbohydrates.'
- Lectins of both plant and animal origin have been widely used to map cell surface
  carbohydrates (glycoproteins) and to observe changes occurring during malignant
  transformation and development (Sharon and Lis 1989).
- An array of biological functions is attributed to the binding of lectins to the
  cell surface sugars.
- The lectins are thus reckoned with the functions such as tumor cell recognition,
  cell adhesion, localization, signal transduction across the membrane, mitogenic
  stimulation, potentiation of host immune defense, cytotoxicity, and apoptosis (Mody
  et al.
- 1995).
- Lectins derived from _Helix_ sp., _Limax_ sp., _Achatina_ sp., and their binding
  to different groups of carbohydrates and their prognostic properties to bind the
  metastatic cells preferentially have been demonstrated in recent studies (Miller
  1982; Iggchi et al.
- 1985; Sukhikh et al.
- 1985; Fenlon et al.
- 1987; Schumacher et al.
- 1995).
- Lectins or lectin-like proteins endowed with the ability to bind sialoglycoconjugates
  have been used as recognition molecules to predict changes in the pattern of sialylation
  and the degree of O-acetylation during malignant transformation (Cheresh et al.
- 1984; Basu et al.
- 1986; Crocker et al.
- 1991; Fragkiadakis and Stratakis 1997).
- It is very crucial to identify the reliable markers of metastatic potentials in
  the development of cancer therapeutics.
- Several screening protocols may help evaluate the prognostic properties of lectins.
- In the present study, the cytotoxic effects of hemolymph derived achatininH (lectin)
  from _Achatina fulica_ and its binding properties to the breast cancer cell line
  MCF7 have been delineated using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
  bromide (MTT) assay, immunocytochemistry, and flowcytometry.
- It is known that MTT is an established technique to estimate the in vitro cellular
  viability in the disease-oriented screening protocols in cancer research (Twentyman
  and Luscombe 1987; Pieters et al.
- 1990).
- The MTT assay is based on the fact that only viable cells reduce tetrazolium salts
  to colored formazan, which can be quantitated spectrophotometrically.
- Besides measuring viability, activation, and proliferation, the MTT assay has also
  been recently adopted to measure the clonogenesity of cancer cells in culture system
  (Van-de-Loosdrecht et al.
- 1994).
- The specific binding of achatininH to MCF7 cells observed in our study would provide
  a viable prognostic marker in tumor cell detection.
- We have also observed that the increased expression of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)
  by tumor cells (Langgut et al.
- 1993; Reisser et al.
- 1994) could be suppressed by achatininH treatment.
- The cytotoxic potential of achatininH was evaluated at the cellular level in terms
  of DNA damage, alterations in cellular morphology, and cell cycle profile.
- The sialic acid binding achatininH from hemolymph of land snail _A.
- fulica_ was purified by affinity chromatography on sheep submaxillary mucin coupled
  to Sepharose 4B as described previously (Indra et al.
- 2000).
- Human mammary carcinoma cell line (MCF7) was procured from the National Centre for
  Cell Sciences, Pune, India, and was adapted to grow in minimum essential medium
  (MEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 100 mg/ml streptomycin and 100
  IU/ml penicillin.
- Cell culture was performed in 24 well plates (1 × 105 cells/well) in a humidified
  atmosphere at 37° C with 5% CO2.
- MTT assay was carried out to evaluate the cell-mediated cytotoxicity as previously
  described (Mosmann 1983).
- MCF7 cells were detached from the culture flask by treatment with 0.05% trypsin–EDTA
  and cell viability was determined by trypan blue.
- Cells were seeded in 24-well plates (1 × 105 cells ml−1 well−1) and incubated for
  48 h. The medium was then withdrawn and fresh medium (1 ml) with different concentrations
  of achatininH (6–16 μg/ml) in lectin buffer Tris-buffered saline (TBS) (50 mM Tris–HCl
  pH 7.6 with 1 mM CaCl2 and MgCl2) was added and incubated for different time intervals
  (24 and 48 h).
- Appropriate controls without the addition of achatininH were kept.
- The plates were observed under a phase-contrast microscope for morphological changes
  after the specified time intervals.
- Photomicrographs were taken using a Leica (Wetzlar, Mannheim, Germany) DMIRB microscope
  at 10× magnification.
- The medium was withdrawn after specified time intervals and fresh medium (200 μl)
  was added to each well.
- Then, 50 μl of MTT solution at a concentration of 5 mg/ml [5 mg of MTT/ml of phosphate-buffered
  saline (PBS) was filter sterilized and kept for not more than 2 wk at 4° C] was
  added into each well and kept for 4 h at 37° C. The assay is based on cleavage of
  the tetrazolium salt MTT by mitochondrial dehydrogenase to form a purple-colored
  formazan complex soluble in DMSO, which was quantified spectrophotometrically at
  540 nm with reference filter at 690 nm using a Perkin-Elmer (Waltham, MA) Lambda
  35UV-visible spectrophotometer.
- Duplicates for each time period were kept in each assay and repeated three times.
- The viability results are shown as a graph with absorption on the Y axis and achatininH
  concentration on the X axis.
- "The percent proliferation and the percent cytotoxicity were calculated by the following
  equation: \n\n$$\\begin{array}{{20}c} {{\\% {\\text{Proliferation}} = \\frac{{{\\left(
  {{\\text{Test}}\\;{\\text{cell}}\\;{\\text{OD - Control}}\\;{\\text{cell}}\\;{\\text{OD}}
  } \\right)} \\times 100}}{{{\\text{Control}}\\;{\\text{cell}}\\;{\\text{OD}}}}}}
  \\\\\\ {{\\% {\\text{Cytotoxicity}} = \\frac{{{\\left( {{\\text{Control}}\\;{\\text{cell}}\\;{\\text{OD

  \\\\\\ \\end{array} $$\n\nIC50 values are defined as the drug concentration needed
  to inhibit cell growth to 50% of controls."
- To evaluate the cell proliferation, 1 × 105 cells/well were seeded in triplicates
  in a 24-well plate (Greiner, Frickenhausen, Germany).
- The plate was incubated at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 air for 2 d
  to form a complete monolayer.
- Then, the medium was removed and fresh maintenance medium MEM with 2% FCS was added.
- AchatininH at two different concentrations (8 and 10 μg/ml) was added to each well
  and the plate was incubated at 37° C for 24 and 48 h. The cells were detached from
  the plate using trypsin–EDTA.
- Cell suspension 0.2 ml and trypan blue 0.2 ml were mixed well and counted using
  Neubar counting chamber.
- Rabbits were immunized by intramuscular injection of achatininH (protein 1 mg/ml)
  mixed with complete Freund’s adjuvant and, after 1 wk, again immunized by intramuscular
  injection of achatininH (1 mg/ml) mixed with incomplete Freund’s adjuvant.
- Finally, a booster injection was given with achatininH without adjuvant and blood
  was collected after 7 d of the last injection and the antiserum was tested by immunodiffusion.

  St. Louis, MO.
- Western blot analysis was performed according to the method of Towbin et al.
- (1979) using transblot apparatus (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA).
- After separation by SDS-PAGE, the protein (achatininH) was transferred onto nitrocellulose
  (0.45 μm, Hybond-C Super, Amersham, Buckinghamshire, UK).
- Skimmed milk powder (5%) supplemented with 0.1% Tween 20 was used as blocking buffer.
- The blots were incubated for 1 h with primary anti-achatininH antibody (1:500) in
  PBS Tween and then with anti-rabbit secondary antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase
  (Sigma) (1:500) for visualization of the achatininH transblotted onto the nitrocellulose.
- Exponentially growing cells were treated with 8 μg/ml achatininH for 48 h. The medium
  was aspirated and the cells (treated and control) were rinsed with cold PBS.
- 'The cells were scraped and homogenized in 1× lysis buffer [10× lysis buffer: 200
  mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.5), 1.5 M NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, 10% Triton, 25 mM sodium pyrophosphate,
  10 mM beta-glycerophosphate, 10 mM Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml leupeptin and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl
  fluoride] and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4° C. The supernatant was
  aliquoted into a new eppendorf tube and stored at −80° C. The cell lysate was used
  for the following analysis.'
- LDH activity was determined by the procedure adopted by King (1965a).
- Acid and alkaline phosphatases were determined by the method of Moog (1946) and
  the transaminases viz., alanine transaminase and aspartate transminase were estimated

- Appropriate controls without achatininH were kept.
- The results were analyzed using one-way ANOVA (SPSS package student’s version, SPSS,
  Chicago, IL).
- The level of lipid peroxidase (LPO) was assayed by the method of Ohkawa et al.
- (1979), in which malondialdehyde released served as an index for LPO.
- The activity of catalase (CAT) was assayed by the method of Sinha (1972).
- In this method, dichromate in acetic acid was reduced to chromic acetate when heated
  in the presence of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), with the formation of perchloric acid
  as an unstable intermediate.
- Chromic acetate thus produced was measured colorimetrically at 610 nm.
- The activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) was determined by the method of Marklund
  and Marklund (1974).
- The unit of enzyme activity is defined as the enzyme required for 50% inhibition
  of pyrogallol auto-oxidation.
- The glutathione peroxidase activity was assayed by the method of Rotruck et al.
- (1973) based on the reaction between glutathione and 5,5′-dithio bis-(2-nitrobenzoic
  acid) to form a complex that showed absorbance maximally at 412 nm.
- The antioxidant activities were expressed as units per minute per milligram of protein.
- The values between the control and test were analyzed using one-way ANOVA (SPSS
  package student’s version).
- MCF7 cells were seeded on slides (1 × 105 cells/ml) and cultured for 48 h. The slides
  were incubated with achatininH (8 μg/ml) for 48 h and rinsed with PBS [50 mM PBS
  pH 7.4, 2% (V/V) FCS and 0.1% (W/V) sodium azide] and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde
  in 0.1 M PBS.
- The slides were washed three times in lectin buffer (TBS), and anti-achatininH antibody
  (1:500) was added and incubated for 1 h at room temperature.
- Slides were washed three times with PBS; cells were incubated with goat anti-rabbit
  flourescein isothiocyanate (FITC) conjugate (1:500) for 1 h at room temperature.
- The slides were washed three times with PBS and analyzed by fluorescence microscope
  (LEICA DMIRB with fluorescence filter).
- Images were captured with a SPOT digital camera.
- Flow cytometry was carried out on a fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) caliber
  instrument (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) with argon laser excitation at
  488 nm as described previously (Yu et al.
- 2003).
- In PBS, 1 × 105 cells (control and achatininH-treated cells) were washed once and
  fixed in 70% ethanol at −20° C overnight.
- Fixed cells were washed and resuspended in a buffer containing 50 μg/ml propidium
  Iodide and 1% Triton X-100.
- PI-stained cells were analyzed in the cytometer and the total DNA content in each
  phase of the cell cycle was quantified.
- For 20 min, 2 × 106 cells were lysed in STE buffer (0.9% sodium chloride, 10 mM
  Tris–HCl, 10 mM EDTA, and 0.2% Triton X-100, pH 7.5) and the lysate was incubated
  with proteinase K overnight at 37° C. DNA was extracted as described previously.
- Equal amounts of DNA from the control and achatininH-treated cells was loaded in
  each lane on a 2% agarose gel and DNA bands were visualized by ethidium bromide
  staining after electrophoresis (Azmi et al.
- 2000).
- The values are expressed as mean ± SE.
- The results were computed statistically (SPSS software package, version 10.1, SPSS)
  using one-way analysis of variance.
- The differences were regarded as statistically significant at _P_ &lt; 0.05.
- The cytotoxicity assay by MTT exhibits toxicity in a dose- and time-dependent manner
  (Fig.

- In contrast, a significant proliferation was observed with the untreated cells.
- The reduction in cell proliferation was observed at a concentration of 6 μg, while
  55% of cell death was observed with a concentration of 8 μg/ml.

  The purified achatininH gave a single band on the native gel, and its molecular
  weight was estimated as 24.2 kDa.'
- In the presence of SDS and β-mercaptoethanol, the protein resolved into identical
  subunits with molecular weight 15,000 Da (Fig.

  were reduced to nearly 50% in the treated cells compared to that of untreated control
  cells.
- The activities of LDH, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase
  were also significantly decreased in the treated cells.
- On the other hand, activities of glutathione peroxidase and CAT slightly increased

- Binding of achatininH to MCF7 cells is demonstrated in Fig.
- 5
- The fluorescence intensity on the membrane of MCF7 cells was visualized by the antilectin
  antibody (1:500) conjugated to FITC secondary antibody.
- Almost all the MCF7 cells treated with achatininH fluoresced and demonstrated a
  moderate to strong staining (Fig.
- 5), indicating the presence of the achatininH binding sites on MCF7 cells.
- AchatininH binding to MCF7 breast cancer cell line detected by immunofluorescence
  assay.
- (_a_) Control, (_b_) MCF7 cells treated with achatininH for 48 h (magnification
  20×), and (_c_) cells treated with achatininH for 48 h (magnification 60×).
- The flowcytometry-based assay exhibited the changes in cell cycle on treatment with
  achatininH.
- The percentage of cells in S phase after exposure to IC50 (8 μg/ml) of achatininH
  was 12%, while it was 36% in untreated (absence of achatininH) cells (Fig.
- 6).
- However, after 48 h, the G2/M peak declined in the treated MCF7 cells conspicuously.
- In the untreated cells, the percentage of cells in G2/M phase (mitosis) was 18%.
- The process of cell division has been halted, as indicated by the presence of only
  9% cells in G2/M phase.
- It is also observed that 32% of the cells have entered the apoptotic phase, while
  it was 6% in untreated cells, indicating DNA damage.
- FACs analysis of DNA (_a_) control MCF7 cells and (_b_) achatininH-treated MCF7
  cells.
- DNA isolated from the achatininH-treated cells was electrophoresed on a 2% agarose
  gel to quantify DNA damage.
- Figure 7 is the electrophoretic profile of DNA, as evidenced by ethidium bromide
  staining.
- Lane 1 is the DNA ladder (100 bp), lane 2 is the DNA sample from 24-h achatininH-treated
  cells, lane 3 is the DNA sample from 48-h achatininH-treated cells, and lane 4 is
  the control MCF7 cells.
- The DNA damage in lanes 2 and 3 is nearly the same thus signifying that 24 h is
  sufficient for achatininH to bring about damage of cellular DNA.
- Agarose gel electrophoresis of DNA isolated from MCF7 treated with achatininH for
  24 h (_lane 2_), MCF7 treated with achatininH for 48 h (_lane 3_), and control (_lane
  4_).
- DNA ladder (100 bp).
- In this study, achatininH-mediated cytotoxicity is described with respect to human
  mammary carcinoma cell line MCF7.
- Excellent linearity could be observed in the MTT assay between cell number and absorbance
  (OD) up to 3 × 105 cells/well.
- Reduction in cell proliferation was observed at a concentration of 6 μg of achatininH.
- At 8 μg/ml concentration, the MTT assay showed 55% cell death, whereas by cell count
  method the cell death observed was 62%.
- This small difference may be due to a reduced sensitivity by MTT.
- The MTT assay depends both on the number of cells present and on the mitochondrial
  activity per cell.
- Earlier studies by Baker et al.
- (1979) demonstrated that concanavalinA-activated T-cells produced much less formazan
  than EL4, and in our study, achatininH (lectin)-bound cells produced less formazan.
- The viability of MCF7 cells was affected in the presence of achatininH, as it induced
  cytotoxicity in these cells.
- The cytotoxic action of achatininH on MCF7 cells is of interest, due to the selective
  killing of only transformed cells.
- AchatininH had no effect on normal human fibroblasts even at high doses (data not
  shown).
- Similarly, the cytotoxicity of lectins derived from other molluscan species has
  been demonstrated with other types of cancer cell lines.
- (Schumacher et al.
- 1992; Thomas et al.
- 1993; Chitra et al.
- 1997).
- In the present study, the effect of achatininH on MCF7 cells showed increase in
  LPO indicating activation of the free radical scavenging enzymes such as SOD and
  CAT.
- The increase in CAT activity in achatininH-treated MCF7 cells indicates that the
  treatment may help to lower H2O2 concentration by its decomposition and, hence,
  reduce oxidative stress.
- The SOD activity decreased with achatininH treatment.
- It may be construed that the altered antioxidants and enzyme activity may lower
  the cAMP concentration and decrease subsequent reduction of deoxyribonucleotides
  for DNA synthesis, which is a crucial step in neoplastic growth and tumorigenesis
  (Albert et al.
- 1990).
- In the present study, the LDH, acid and alkaline phosphatase, and alanine aminotransferase
  activities also significantly (_p_ &lt; 0.05) decreased in the treated MCF7 cells
  compared to control (Fig.
- 4 _b_).
- LDH is a tetrameric enzyme and is recognized as a potential tumor marker in assessing
  the progression of the proliferating malignant cells.
- The elevated activity of LDH may be due to its overproduction by tumor cells (Mirmomeni
  et al.
- 1979), or it may be due to the release of isoenzymes from destroyed tissues (Engan
  and Hannisdal 1990).
- Recent studies also showed that LDH activity in the serum of DLA mice was elevated
  about 14-fold, and treatment with queuine decreased the activity significantly up
  to fourfold (Pathak and Manjula 2005).
- The achatininH-caused antimitotic effect on cancer cells is evident in the cell
  cycle studies with MCF7 cells.
- Flow cytometry is one of the most powerful and specific methods for the integrated
  study of molecular and morphological events occurring during cell death and cell
  proliferation and measures the total amount of DNA in cells (Darz et al.
- 1997).
- FACS analysis of DNA from untreated cells and DNA from achatininH-treated cells
  was carried out, and Fig.
- 6 _a_ and _b_ exhibit similar results.
- MCF7 cells were blocked at S-phase after lectin treatment, and the percentage of
  cells in S-phase was 12%, whereas in untreated cells it was 36% after exposure for
  48 h. A previous report indicated that 2-methoxyestradiol treatment of the estrogen-dependent
  cell line (MCF7) caused G2/M arrest associated with the depolymerization of tubulin
  (Tishler et al.
- 1995; Attalla et al.
- 1996).
- A lower percentage of MCF7 cells in S-phase and a lower percentage in G2/M (metaphase)
  than the controls is depicted in Fig.
- 6
- In S-phase, cell death was observed after 48 h of achatininH exposure, which produces
  a low cell count in G2/M phase (mitotic phase).
- It may be inferred from the above results that, although lectin binds to the receptor
  domains on the cell’s surface, the signal transduction occurs even in S-phase.
- One of the major significant observations is the arrest in G2–M phase, which is
  considered to be the major checkpoint of the cell cycle.
- Appearance of the sub-G1 peak is characteristic of apoptotic cells.
- The extent of apoptosis is quantified by the formation of the typical DNA ladder
  (Khodarer et al.
- 1998).
- Figure 7 is an electrophoretogram of DNA isolated from control and achatininH-treated
  MCF7 cells.
- Lanes 2 and 3 represent DNA isolated from cells treated with achatininH for different
  time periods.
- Some cells are known to show apparent morphological induction of apoptosis in the
  absence of oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation as a late event in the apoptotic process.
- There are some reports of MCF7 cells producing a DNA ladder but others have demonstrated
  that MCF7 cells do not undergo apoptotic DNA fragmentation.
- In an attempt to clarify this conflicting information, Gooch and Yee (1999) demonstrated
  that the ability of MCF7 cells to undergo DNA laddering appears to be strain-specific.
- Taking cue from the above observations and reports, the present scenario signifies
  that achatininH is very potent in inducing cellular damage as reflected by variation
  in total DNA content.
- The finding also suggests that achatininH may offer therapeutic utility as a new
  type of anticancer agent as it selectively inhibited mitosis in the fast-growing
  malignant cells.
- The ligand-binding function of achatininH as a homing molecule and molecular probe
  and the complement-mediated cell lysis of lectins have already been established
  (Chitra et al.
- 1997; Indra et al.
- 2000; Ramalingam et al.
- 2005).
