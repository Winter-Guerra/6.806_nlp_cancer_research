- Hydroxytyrosol (HTyr), an important phenol present in olives, stands out as a compound
  of high value due to its excellent antioxidant, antimicrobial and anticarcinogenic
  activities.
- Hydroxytyrosol (HTyr, 4-(2-(hydroxyethyl)-1,2-benzendiol)) is one of the main phenolic
  compounds in olives, virgin oil and waste water obtained during the production of
  olive oil.
- HTyr has been confirmed as the antioxidant with the highest free radical scavenging
  capacity, and is more active than antioxidant vitamins (C and E) as well as the
  synthetic antioxidants.
- Studies (human, animal, _in vivo_ and _in vitro_) have shown many beneficial attributes
  of this ortho-diphenol compound, e.g.
- anti-inflammatory activity and inhibition of platelet aggregation.
- Similar to other polyphenols, HTyr was shown to prevent atherosclerosis through
  the inhibition of LDL oxidation.
- Furthermore, polyphenols extracted from the virgin olive oil containing mainly HTyr
  were also shown to inhibit different kinds of cancer, e.g.
- proliferation of human leukemia cells and colon carcinogenesis.
- This work summarizes current knowledge on the bioavailability, biological activities
  (e.g.
- anticancer activity, anti-inflammatory activity) and major active components of
  olive oil (containing mainly HTyr).
