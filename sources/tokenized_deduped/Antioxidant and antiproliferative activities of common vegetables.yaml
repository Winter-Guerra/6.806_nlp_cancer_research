- Epidemiological studies have shown that consumption of fruits and vegetables is
  associated with reduced risk of chronic diseases.
- Increased consumption of fruits and vegetables containing high levels of phytochemicals
  has been recommended to prevent chronic diseases related to oxidative stress in
  the human body.
- In this study, 10 common vegetables were selected on the basis of consumption per
  capita data in the United States.
- A more complete profile of phenolic distributions, including both free and bound
  phenolics in these vegetables, is reported here using new and modified methods.
- Broccoli possessed the highest total phenolic content, followed by spinach, yellow
  onion, red pepper, carrot, cabbage, potato, lettuce, celery, and cucumber.
- Red pepper had the highest total antioxidant activity, followed by broccoli, carrot,
  spinach, cabbage, yellow onion, celery, potato, lettuce, and cucumber.
- The phenolics antioxidant index (PAI) was proposed to evaluate the quality/quantity
  of phenolic contents in these vegetables and was calculated from the corrected total
  antioxidant activities by eliminating vitamin C contributions.
- Antiproliferative activities were also studied in vitro using HepG2 human liver
  cancer cells.
- Spinach showed the highest inhibitory effect, followed by cabbage, red pepper, onion,
  and broccoli.
- On the basis of these results, the bioactivity index (BI) for dietary cancer prevention
  is proposed to provide a simple reference for consumers to choose vegetables in
  accordance with their beneficial activities.
- The BI could be a new alternative biomarker for future epidemiological studies in
  dietary cancer prevention and health promotion.
