- Isothiocyanates (ITCs) are molecules naturally present in many cruciferous vegetables
  (broccoli, black radish, daikon radish, and cauliflowers).
- Several studies suggest that cruciferous vegetable consumption may reduce cancer
  risk and slow the aging process.
- To investigate the effect of ITCs on cellular DNA damage, we evaluated the effects
  of two different ITCs [sulforaphane (SFN) and raphasatin (RPS)] on the biology of
  human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which, in addition to their ability to differentiate
  into mesenchymal tissues, contribute to the homeostatic maintenance of many organs.
- 'The choice of SFN and RPS relies on two considerations: they are among the most
  popular cruciferous vegetables in the diet of western and eastern countries, respectively,
  and their bioactive properties may differ since they possess specific molecular
  moiety.'
- Our investigation evidenced that MSCs incubated with low doses of SFN and RPS show
  reduced in vitro oxidative stress.
- Moreover, these cells are protected from oxidative damages induced by hydrogen peroxide,
  while no protection was evident following treatment with the UV ray of a double
  strand DNA damaging drug, such as doxorubicin.
- High concentrations of both ITCs induced cytotoxic effects in MSC cultures and further
  increased DNA damage induced by peroxides.
- In summary, our study suggests that ITCs, at low doses, may contribute to slowing
  the aging process related to oxidative DNA damage.
- Moreover, in cancer treatment, low doses of ITCs may be used as an adjuvant to reduce
  chemotherapy-induced oxidative stress, while high doses may synergize with anticancer
  drugs to promote cell DNA damage.

  material, which is available to authorized users.
- The biological activity of cruciferous vegetables (broccoli, black radish, daikon
  radish, and cauliflowers) is hypothesized to be due to the presence of defensive
  secondary metabolites called glucosinolates (GLs) as well as the enzyme myrosinase.
- When these vegetables are crushed by chopping or chewing, myrosinase catalyzes the
  rapid conversion of GLs into isothiocyanates (ITCs) [1].
- ITCs are a heterogeneous family of molecules with the –N=C=S group as their common
  moiety.
- Several ITCs have an additional sulfur atom in their molecular chain at different
  oxidation states.
- This may confer different biological properties [1].
- A number of studies have documented the chemopreventive properties of ITCs.
- In particular, many studies have addressed the biological properties of sulforaphane
  (SFN) and raphasatin (RPS).
- This is because SFN and RPS are present in the most popular cruciferous vegetables
  in the diet of western and eastern countries, respectively, and their bioactive
  properties may differ since they possess specific molecular moiety (supplemental
  file 1) [1–3].
- It has been demonstrated that these compounds could protect against the onset or
  reduce the severity of cancer, retinal disease, and skin damage resulting from exogenous
  agents or genetic predisposition and may slow the aging processes [1, 3–10].
- Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the effects of ITCs.
- Most researchers suggest that ITCs have an indirect antioxidant activity, which
  involves the activation of Phase-II detoxification enzymes (glutathione _S_-transferase,
  quinone reductase, and glucuronosyltransferase) and the inhibition of Phase-I enzymes
  that activate toxic chemical compounds.
- In this way, ITCs contributes to elevating the cell’s defenses against oxidative
  damage and promotes the removal of carcinogens [1].
- Some ITCs (RPS for example) may also involve a direct anti-oxidant activity due
  to the presence of reduced sulphur in the side chain.
- Indeed, RPS was found to effectively quench hydrogen peroxide and organic hydroperoxides
  even if it did not show any activity capable of impairing a “radical chain reaction”,
  as occurs for effective direct anti-oxidant molecules [1].
- The initial view of ITCs as selective monofunctional inducers of Phase-II antioxidant/detoxifying
  enzymes has lately given way to a more realistic consideration of their very complex
  oxidative stress modulation.
- Indeed, several findings clearly demonstrate that ITCs have to be considered hormetic
  molecules.
- The term hormesis has long been used to describe the phenomenon in which a specific
  chemical is able to induce biologically opposite effects at different doses; most
  commonly, there is a stimulatory or beneficial effect at low doses and an inhibitory
  or toxic effect at high doses [11].
- Toxic effects of ITCs may be associated with their pro-oxidant activities.
- High concentrations of ITCs rapidly accumulate into cells and can react and inactivate
  –SH groups, such as that of glutathione, which is a potent reactive oxygen scavenger
  [1].
- Nevertheless, studies on the biological effects of ITCs have often overlooked the
  hormetic behavior of such compounds and have mainly analyzed the biological and
  molecular mechanisms of their anti-cancer activity.
- Furthermore, few studies have addressed the possible beneficial effects of ITCs
  on the body’s ability to reproduce healthy cells and protect against DNA damage.
- As an antioxidant, ITCs should protect cells from free radical damage, which is
  the primary (but not sole) cause of aging.
- Moreover, little is known about the effect of ITCs on stem cells, whose longevity
  is implicated in human aging.
- In our previous work [10], we evaluated the effects of SFN on the biology of human
  mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which, in addition to their ability to differentiate
  into mesenchymal tissues, support hematopoiesis and contribute to the homeostatic
  maintenance of many organs and tissues [12–14].
- Our investigation found evidence that low doses of SFN promote MSC proliferation
  and protect them from apoptosis and senescence, while higher doses have a cytotoxic
  effect leading to the induction of cell cycle arrest, programmed cell death, and
  senescence.
- The beneficial effects of SFN may be ascribed to its antioxidant properties, which
  were observed when MSC cultures were incubated with low doses of SFN.
- Indeed, low doses of SFN reduced the production of reactive oxygen species both
  in the basal state and under oxidative stress conditions (300 μM H2O2).
- As expected for a hormetic compound, the protective action of SFN on MSCs was lost
  during high concentration treatment [10].
- Extensive research has revealed how the DNA damage-sensing and -signaling pathways,
  referred to as the DNA-damage response network, are tied to cellular senescence
  and apoptosis [15, 16].
- Following DNA damage, a cell responds by activating the cell cycle checkpoint and
  repair mechanisms.
- If DNA damage cannot be properly repaired, damaged cells can be eliminated either
  by apoptosis or senescence.
- Changes in apoptosis and senescence rates in MSCs treated with different SFN concentration
  prompted us to investigate the degree of DNA damage in our cell system.
- To this end we evaluated the effect of two different ITCs (SFN and RPS) on DNA damage
  of human MSCs.
- We evaluated the degree of DNA damage following the treatment of MSCs with different
  DNA damaging agents in the presence of different concentrations of ITCs.
- Our investigation found evidence that MSCs incubated with low doses of SFN and RPS
  show reduced in vitro oxidative stress, while high ITCs concentrations exacerbate
  DNA damage events.

- Statistical significance was evaluated by ANOVA analysis followed by a Student’s
  _t_ test and Bonferroni’s test.
- MSCs were incubated with different amounts of ITCs.
- Several findings evidenced that pharmacokinetic behavior of different ITCs are quite
  similar.
- The concentrations of ITCs we used ranged from 0.25 μM, the bioavailable concentration
  in serum following dietary supplementation, to 20 μM, the minimal bioactive concentration
  used as an anticancer drug [3, 17, 21–25].
- In our previous study, we found that low doses of SFN promoted MSC proliferation
  and protected them from apoptosis and senescence, while higher doses had a cytotoxic
  effect leading to the induction of cell cycle arrest, programmed cell death, and
  senescence [10].
- Considering that ITCs are a very heterogeneous class of compounds, we decided to
  evaluate if another ITC, like the RPS, may have the same effect on the biology of
  MSCs.
- MSC cultures were treated for 3 days with RPS and then analyzed for cell cycle progression.
- The flow cytometry assay and BrdU incorporation evidenced an increase in cells that
  are duplicating DNA in the samples that were treated with 0.25, 1 and 5 μM RPS compared
  to the controls.
- Conversely, after treatment with 20 μM RPS, we observed a significant percentage
  of cells in G2/M (Fig.
- 1a, b).
- We were unable to carry out the BrdU assay for cells treated with 20 μM SFN, suggesting
  that cells accumulated in G2/M and did not proliferate (Fig.
- 1b).
- The data obtained for RPS overlapped that obtained with SFN treatment [10].

- f Differentiation potential of MSCs cultivated in the presence of ITCs.
- Cells were induced to differentiate into adipocytes, osteocytes, and chondrocytes
  as described in the “Materials and methods” section.
- The _picture on the left_ shows adipocytes stained wit with oil red.
- In the _middle_, differentiated chondrocytes were revealed by staining with safranin
  O.
- On the right, differentiated osteocytes were revealed by staining with alizarin

- 'The pictures show an example of differentiation processes in the presence of 1

  Low concentrations of RPS reduced the percentage of apoptotic cells in MSC cultures,
  whereas incubation with 20 μM induced a significant increase in the number of apoptotic
  cells (Fig.'
- 1c).
- These results are also in agreement with the SFN data [10].
- A hormetic behavior of RPS was also observed when looking at the senescence phenomena.
- Treatment with 5 and 20 μM RPS resulted in a significant increase in senescent cells,
  as detected by the acid-β-galactosidase assay.
- On the contrary, low doses of RPS provide a beneficial effect for MSCs by reducing
  the number of senescent cells (Fig.
- 1d).
- This finding was in agreement with the effect induced by SFN treatment.
- The control of the stem cell properties (self-renewal, multipotentiality) may be
  affected by apoptosis and senescence phenomena; hence it is reasonable to have perturbation
  in the stem cell status of MSCs cultivated in presence of ITCs.
- In MSC cultures incubated with different concentrations of RPS, we carried out CFU
  assay to test the clonogenicity, i.e.
- the ability to expand at a single cell level, which is an important feature of self-renewing
  stem cells.
- Low concentrations of RPS did not modify the number of clones observed in 100 mm
  plates seeded at a low density (Fig.
- 1e).
- At the opposite end, in cultures treated with 5 and 20 μM SFN or RPS we observed
  a significant reduction (_p_ &lt; 0.05) of clones (Fig.
- 1e).
- This result is in good agreement with the data on cell death and senescence.
- Experiments carried out with SFN gave similar results (data not shown).
- The differentiation of MSCs into mesenchymal derivatives occurs over a protracted
  period and appears to be accompanied by a progressive restriction in the range of
  fates available to individual cells.
- The modification of cell biology induced by ITC treatment could also affect the
  cell commitment and differentiation process.
- We assessed the multipotentiality of MSCs.
- To this end, we evaluated their osteo–chondro–adipogenic (OCA) in the presence of
  different concentrations of RPS (Fig.
- 1f).
- Differentiation was not significantly affected by low doses of ITCs.
- Nevertheless, osteogenesis and chondrogenesis were severely impaired in cultures
  incubated with 20 μM RPS (Fig.
- 1f).
- Experiments carried out with SFN gave similar results (data not shown).
- Taken together, this data and our previous investigation [10] suggest that the two
  ITCs under investigation, which are present in the most popular cruciferous vegetables
  in the diet of western and eastern countries, have similar effects on stem cell
  biology.
- They may be considered hormetic molecules; at low doses, they may exert protective
  effects on stem cells (at least in vitro), while at higher doses, they show cytostatic
  or cytotoxic effects.
- Senescence and apoptosis are tied to DNA damage pathways.
- Cells with damaged DNA activate the cell cycle checkpoint and repair mechanisms.
- If DNA damage cannot be properly repaired, damaged cells can be eliminated either
  by apoptosis or senescence.
- ITC treatment of MSCs may also affect the level of apoptosis and senescence through
  the modulation of DNA damage.
- For this reason, we decided to evaluate the effect of ITCs on the degree of damaged
  DNA in basal conditions and the following treatment of MSCs with different DNA damaging
  agents.
- We detected cells with damaged DNA by H2AX (gamma isoform) immunostaining.
- H2AX histone is a key regulator of the cellular responses to DNA damage and is considered
  a hallmark of damaged DNA nuclear foci.
- In these experiments we treated cells with low doses (0.25 and 1 μM) of ITCs, since
  only these concentrations were protective for cells.
- In MSC cultures incubated with low concentrations (0.25 μM) of RPS, which reduce
  the degree of senescence and apoptosis, we observed a diminution in the number of
  cells labeled with anti H2AX compared to control (Fig.
- 2a, left table).
- No significant reduction of H2AX staining was observed for SFN treated cells (Fig.
- 2a, left table).
- These results show that RPN was very efficient in lowering the basal level of endogenous
  DNA damage, while SFN was not.

  Following analysis of DNA damage in basal condition, we determined protective effect
  of ITCs in presence of damaging agents.'
- As expected, H2O2 treatment of MSCs induced an increase of H2AX-positive cells (Fig.
- 2a, left table, compare no treatment CRTL vs. H2O2 CTRL).
- In H2O2 treated cultures, the percentage of H2AX-positive cells was lower in presence
  of 0.25 μM RPS and SFN compared with CTRL.
- Nevertheless, a closer analysis showed that RPS treatment did not protect from H2O2
  damage since the percentage of H2AX-positive cells increased following peroxide
  treatment in cultures incubated with RPS (in the table of Fig.
- 2a compare the level of H2AX-positive cells in presence of RPS in basal conditions
  vs. H2O2 treatment).
- On the opposite, SFN that did not reduce significantly the basal level H2AX cells
  evidenced a protective effect against peroxide damage (compare the level of H2AX-positive
  cells in presence of SFN in basal conditions vs. H2O2 treatment).
- H2O2 produces multiple modifications in DNA.
- Oxidative attack by OH radicals on the deoxyribose moiety leads to the release of
  free bases from DNA, generating strand breaks with various sugar modifications and
  simple abasic (AP) sites.
- H2O2 also induces the modification of bases, such as in the formation of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine
  (8oxodG).
- We analyzed the effects of hydrogen peroxide on the MSC by determining the percentage
  of oxo8dG-positive cells.
- H2O2 treatment of MSCs induced an increase of 8oxodG-positive cells (Fig.
- 2a, right table, compare no treatment CRTL vs. H2O2 CTRL).
- In H2O2 treated cultures, the percentage of 8oxodG-positive cells was lower in presence
  of RPS and SFN compared with CTRL.
- Also in this case, a closer analysis showed that RPS treatment did not protect from
  H2O2 damage since the percentage of 8oxodG-positive cells increased following peroxide
  treatment in cultures incubated with RPS (in the table of Fig.
- 2a compare the level of 8oxodG-positive cells in presence of RPS in basal conditions
  vs. H2O2 treatment).
- SFN showed a certain degree of protection against peroxide damage (compare the level
  of 8oxodG-positive cells in presence of SFN in basal conditions vs. H2O2 treatment).
- Overall, these results reveal that exogenously-induced DNA damage is different from
  endogenous DNA damage, and while the latter appears to be sensitive to RPS, the
  former is not.
- In this context, SFN appears to have a somewhat opposite effect, whereby it has
  very modest effect in reducing basal H2AX and 8-oxo-G, it has a respectable ability
  to attenuate the rise of these two markers of DNA damage when cells were treated
  with H2O2.
- In cells treated with UV ray, the presence of low doses of ITCs did not protect
  the cells from DNA damage as detected by H2AX staining (Fig.
- 2b, right table).
- UV radiation induces crosslinking between adjacent thymine bases, creating pyrimidine
  dimers.
- As such, the outcome of UV treatment was investigated by digesting genomic DNA with
  T4 endonuclease V in order to evaluate the level of pyrimidine dimers.
- This enzyme locates and binds to pyrimidine dimers in DNA, then cleaves the _N_-glycosylic
  bond of the 5′ pyrimidine portion of the dimer and breaks the 3′ phosphodiester
  bond to the resulting abasic site.
- This induces the fragmentation of DNA-containing dimers that can be easily analyzed.
- UV radiation induced the degradation of DNA in MSC cultures.
- Interestingly, treating cells with ITCs did not modify the fragmentation of DNA,
  as detected by agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig.
- 2b).
- Doxorubicin is a topoisomerase II-stabilizing drug that mainly induces DNA double
  strand breaks [26].
- In cells treated with doxorubicin, the presence of low doses of ITCs did not protect
  the cells from DNA damage as detected by H2AX staining (Fig.
- 2c, right table).
- We determined the effect of doxorubicin also by detecting DNA breaks using COMET
  assay.
- Doxorubicin induced DNA fragmentation in MSC cultures.
- Interestingly, treating cells with ITCs showed an augment in the fragmentation of
  DNA, as detected by agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig.
- 2c, left table).
- This result is in contrast with H2AX data, which showed neither protective nor exacerbating
  effect of ITC on doxorubicin induced DNA damage.
- Doxorubicin treated cells undergo apoptosis and then in the late stage of this process
  they detach from culture dishes.
- It may be hypothesized that the presence of ITCs, while not protecting from DNA
  damaging effects of doxorubicin, may slow apoptosis progression resulting in the
  presence of a higher number of cells with fragmented DNA that are still attached
  on the culture plate.
- Based on the observation that low concentrations (0.25 and 1 μM) of ITCs trigger
  a positive DNA damage response in MSCs incubated with peroxide hydrogen, we investigated
  whether the ITC treatment of MSCs was accompanied by changes in expression of genes
  involved in different types of DNA repair.
- We selected a variety of genes involved in the regulation of base and nucleotide
  excision repair (BER and NER, respectively), mismatch repair (MER), and double strand
  break repair (DSBR) [27–29].
- A complex expression pattern was observed following incubation with SFN or RPS (Table
  1).
- "Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of mRNA expression from MSCs incubated (A) with or
  without SFN or RPS and (B) with H2O2 in presence or absence of SFN or RPS  \n\n\nThe
  mRNA levels were normalized with respect to GAPDH, which was selected as an internal
  control."
- Each experiment was repeated at least three times.
- Table shows mRNA expression levels at 72 h post-treatment.

  In basal conditions we observed a general upregulation of DNA repair genes in cells
  incubated with 0.25 μM SFN, 1 μM SFN and 0.25 μM RPS compared with control (Table
  1a).'
- In H2O2 treated cells some DNA repair genes were upregulated and some other showed
  decreased expression compared with control (see CTRL + H2O2 versus CTRL in Table
  1a, b).
- This may suggest that cell machinery is trying to counteract exogenous DNA damage
  event.
- The H2O2 treatment in presence of ITCs gave interesting results.
- In detail, cells incubated with 0.25 μM SFN and treated with peroxide hydrogen showed
  a general increase in the expression of DNA repair genes compared with cells incubated
  with H2O2 without SFN (see 0.25 μM SFN + H2O2 versus CTRL + H2O2 in Table 1b).
- Incubation with 0.25 μM RPS produced the upregulation of a lesser number of DNA
  repair genes, while, in all other conditions (1 μM SFN and 1 μM RPS) we detected
  a decrease in the expression of many DNA repair genes.
- In this context, the observation that 0.25 μM SFN has the ability to exert an effect
  on exogenous H2O2-derived source of DNA damage (Fig.
- 2) is in line with the upregulation of DNA repair genes.
- On the other hand, higher concentration of ITCs may exacerbate DNA damage also through
  downregulation of DNA repair gene activity.
- Many researchers are committed to showing that curative properties of foods have
  gone beyond mere folklore.
- Nutraceutic studies are indeed devoted to demonstrate that a product isolated or
  purified from foods, which is generally sold in medicinal forms not usually associated
  with food, may have a physiological benefit on human health.
- Among hundreds of nutraceutic products, many scientist are focusing their attention
  on Brassica vegetables because of their content in ITC metabolites and because these
  vegetables are broadly present in the diet of western and eastern countries.
- Several studies have suggested that ITCs may slow aging and prevent cancer due to
  their anti-oxidant properties.
- Nevertheless, these compounds are hormetic molecules, which may induce biologically
  opposite effects at different doses; most commonly, there is a stimulatory or beneficial
  effect at low doses and an inhibitory or toxic effect at high doses [11].
- Toxic effects of ITCs may be associated with their pro-oxidant activities.
- To gain an in depth view on the physiological effects of ITCs, we decided to investigate
  their role in stem cell biology.
- We chose this because several studies have demonstrated that aging is partly the
  result of an age-associated decline in stem cell self-renewal, replication, and
  lineage commitment [30].
- Moreover, mutations in the stem cell reservoir may give rise to transformed stem
  cells that sustain the onset of cancer [31].
- We focused our interest on the effect of ITCs on DNA damage pathways since the modulation
  of reactive oxygen levels is strictly associated with macromolecule damages.
- In the current study, and in our previous research [10], we found that low doses
  of SFN and RPS promote MSC proliferation and protect cells from apoptosis and senescence
  (Fig.
- 1), while higher doses had a cytotoxic effect leading to the induction of cell cycle
  arrest, programmed cell death, and senescence (Fig.
- 1).
- Of interest is that no significant differences were detected in the biological effects
  of two compounds even if RPS has a reduced sulphur atom in the side chain that is
  absent in SFN (supplemental file 1).
- It could be deduced that this reduced atom did not cause further anti-oxidant activity,
  as it was hypothesized [1].
- Our data suggests that both SFN and RPS may induce biologically opposite effects
  at different doses.
- The effect of SFN and RPS on the level of cellular DNA damage was investigated under
  the basal condition and under different stress conditions (oxidative stress, UV
  ray exposure, and doxorubicin treatment).
- Low doses of SFN and RPS reduced the degree of DNA damage in the basal state (Fig.
- 2a–c).
- This is in agreement with the reduced percentage of apoptosis and senescence observed
  (Fig.
- 1) [10].
- In addition, at a 5 and 20 μM concentration, the protective action of ITCs was lost
  (Fig.
- 2a–c).
- This finding may be related to the observation that high doses of ITC may have pro-oxidant
  properties due to their ability to cause glutathione depletion and superoxide production
  in cells.
- We then evaluated the effects of ITCs under stress conditions.
- UV rays and doxorubicin treatments of MSCs augmented the percentage of H2AX-positive
  cells.
- This was associated with an increased presence of pyrimidine dimers and DNA double
  strand breaks in cells treated with UV rays and doxorubicin, respectively (Fig.
- 2a, c).
- The presence of ITCs in the culture medium did not modify the degree of observed
  damage.
- Of interest is that following the oxidative damage of DNA, ITCs showed a hormetic
  behavior.
- Low concentrations of ITCs reduced the percentage of oxidized DNA bases, whereas
  at high doses they boost DNA damage (Fig.
- 2a).
- This ability in modulating the level of oxidative DNA damage is also related to
  the function of genes involved in DNA repair.
- Following oxidative damage, we observed the activation of several genes involved
  in DNA repair pathways (Table 1).
- The presence of low concentration of ITCs in culture media attenuated the “activation”
  of DNA repair genes (Table 1).
- This may be explained considering that ITCs exert a protective effect against peroxide
  damage by reducing the level of damaged DNA and the need of a strong cellular counteraction.
- Our study suggests that both SFN and RPS may have a beneficial role on human health
  by fighting aging and cancer.
- Low doses of ITCs, as they can be taken with dietary amounts of Brassica vegetables,
  reduce cellular stress that is associated with DNA damage.
- This, in turn, decreases the rate of senescence in the stem cell compartment.
- Dietary consumption of Brassica vegetables may hence be valuable in slowing the
  aging process.
- In this respect, Brassica vegetables could be considered a functional food, i.e.,
  a conventional food that is consumed as part of a usual diet, and it has physiological
  benefits and/or reduces the risk of chronic disease beyond basic nutritional functions
  [32].
- A different consideration has to be made about ITCs and cancer.
- These compounds could be used as true nutraceutics and not only as bioactive compounds
  present in functional food.
- Several adverse effects of chemotherapy treatments have been described, and most
  of these effects are associated with the cellular oxidative stress of antineoplastic
  drugs [33].
- As a result, there is significant interest in developing adjuvant chemotherapies
  to augment the currently available treatment protocols, which may allow for decreased
  side effects and toxicity without compromising therapeutic efficacy.
- ITCs at low concentrations, with their anti-oxidant effects, may be potential candidates.
- On the other hand, the treatment of cancer patients with high concentrations of
  ITCs may potentiate the effects of other neoplastic drugs by promoting the senescence
  and apoptosis of cancer cells.
