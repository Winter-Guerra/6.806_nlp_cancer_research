- Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are chaperones for several client proteins involved in
  transcriptional regulation, signal transduction, and cell cycle control.
- HSPs (27, 70, and 90) are abundantly expressed in a wide range of cancers and are
  transcriptionally regulated by heat shock factor (HSF1).
- Most of the synthetic HSP inhibitors exhibit toxicity, therefore, searching for
  inhibitors with limited or no toxicity will be of help.
- The objective of the present study was to determine the effect of natural isothiocyanate
  (phenethyl isothiocyanate; PEITC) on different HSPs (27, 70, and 90) and HSF1 in
  2 breast cancer cell lines, namely breast adenocarcinoma MCF-7 (with wild type p53)
  and highly metastatic breast cancer cell MDA-MB-231 (with mutated p53).
- PEITC significantly inhibited the expression of HSPs (particularly HSP 90) and HSF1.
- Molecular consequences due to HSP inhibition were downregulation of cell-cycle regulatory
  proteins like Cyclin B1, CDK1, Cdc25C, PLK-1, and upregulation of p21 irrespective
  of p53 status.
- These modulations were accompanied by cell-cycle arrest at G2/M phase and apoptosis
  by activation of caspases 3 and 9.
- PEITC therefore may be regarded as a potent HSP inhibitor and an antitumor agent
  in the treatment of breast cancer.
