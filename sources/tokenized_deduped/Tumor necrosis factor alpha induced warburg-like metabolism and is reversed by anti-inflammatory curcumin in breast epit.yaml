- The reprogramming of cellular metabolism in cancer cells is a well-documented effect.
- It has previously been shown that common oncogene expression can induce aerobic
  glycolysis in cancer cells.
- However, the direct effect of an inflammatory microenvironment on cancer cell metabolism
  is not known.
- Here, we illustrate that treatment of nonmalignant (MCF-10a) and malignant (MCF-7)
  breast epithelial cells with low-level (10 ng/ml) tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α)
  significantly increased glycolytic reliance, lactate export and expression of the
  glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1).
- TNF-α decreased total mitochondrial content; however, oxygen consumption rate was
  not significantly altered, suggesting that overall mitochondrial function was increased.
- Upon glucose starvation, MCF7 cells treated with TNF-α demonstrated significantly
  lower viability than nontreated cells.
- Interestingly, these properties can be partially reversed by coincubation with the
  anti-inflammatory agent curcumin in a dose-dependent manner.
- This work demonstrates that aerobic glycolysis can be directly induced by an inflammatory
  microenvironment independent of additional genetic mutations and signals from adjacent
  cells.
- Furthermore, we have identified that a natural dietary compound can reverse this
  effect.
- An emerging hallmark of cancer is the reprogramming of cellular energetic pathways.
- '[1] Virtually all cancers have been shown to upregulate glycolysis and lactate
  production, even in the presence of oxygen, a phenomenon referred to as aerobic
  glycolysis or the Warburg effect.'
- It has been shown that expression of the oncogenes c-Myc[2] and Akt[3] can induce
  aerobic glycolysis.
- '[4] In addition, aerobic glycolysis can be induced by inflammatory gene expression
  in adjacent cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which affect cancer cell metabolism
  by shuttling lactate, ketones and glutamine to the cancer cells.'
- '[5] However, the direct effect of an inflammatory microenvironment on reprogramming
  of energetic pathways is less understood.'
- Although several mechanisms for inflammation-induced tumorigenesis have been studied,
  there are relatively few reports on the role of chronic inflammation in the reprogramming
  of cancer cell metabolism.
- Indirect evidence supports that this may be an important mechanism of inflammation-induced
  tumorigenesis.
- It has recently been shown that nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB), a central regulator
  of the inflammatory response, is also a key regulator of energy homeostasis and
  aerobic glycolysis in mouse embryonic fibroblasts.
- '[6] Chronic inflammation has also been associated with alterations in mitochondrial
  metabolism.'
- '[7] Together, these data suggest that chronic inflammation may cause tumorigenesis
  in part, through alteration of the balance between aerobic glycolysis and oxidative
  mitochondrial metabolism.'
- Many natural compounds have been investigated as anticancer agents because of their
  anti-inflammatory properties.
- Curcumin (diferuloylmethane), the bioactive component of the spice, tumeric, is
  a nontoxic compound that has been shown to inhibit the growth of human breast cancer
  cells _in vitro,_[8, 9] mammary carcinogenesis _in vivo_[10, 11] and breast metastases
  to the lung in immunodeficient mice.
- '[12, 13] Curcumin is thought to inhibit phosphorylation of the inhibitor of kappa
  B, thereby preventing nuclear translocation of inflammation-related transcription
  factor, NFκB.'
- '[14, 15]


  Together, these studies suggest that aerobic glycolysis in cancer cells could be
  partly controlled by the balance of inflammatory and anti-inflammatory agents.'
- In this study, we investigated the effect of low levels of the inflammatory cytokine,
  TNF-α, along with the anti-inflammatory agent curcumin on aerobic glycolysis and
  mitochondrial metabolism, in the breast epithelial cell lines, MCF-10A and MCF 7.
- Nonmalignant (MCF-10a) and malignant (MCF-7) breast epithelial cells from ATCC (Manassas,
  VA) were maintained under standard cell-culture technique (Supporting Information
  Table 1).
- Cells were treated with either DMSO (control) or 10 ng/ml TNF-α (R and D Systems,
  Minneapolis, MN) with or without curcumin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) at 5 or 10 μM and
  incubated at 37°C in 5% CO2 for 96 hr.
- Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA).
- cDNA was synthesized using the Retroscript™ RT kit (Ambion, Austin, TX).
- Glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) was normalized to TATA-binding protein using primers
  from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA; Supporting Information Table 2).
- qRT-PCR was performed in triplicate using SYBR Green measured by the LightCycler
  480 real-time PCR system (Roche, Indianapolis, IN).
- Relative expression levels were determined by the ΔΔ_C_p method.
- '[16]




  Cells were incubated with either an anti-PGC-1α (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies), cytochrome
  C (also Santa Cruz) or GLUT1 (Abcam) antibody at 1:200 dilution overnight.'
- Secondary AlexaFluor633 or AlexaFluor488 antibodies (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) were
  applied in 1:200 dilution.
- Confocal microscopy was performed using ZEN (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY).
- To verify increased mitochondrial content, cells were treated and stained with Mitotracker
  200 nM (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and imaged as described earlier.
- Fluorescence was quantified using seven cells per treatment using ImageJ software
  (http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/).
- Cells were seeded overnight in 24-well culture plate at density 5 × 105 cells/well.
- Following treatment, culture media were removed and replaced with XF Assay Media
  from SeaHorse Bioscience (Billerica, MA) containing 4500 mg/l glucose and incubated
  at 37°C.
- Per manufactures' protocol, SeaHorse injection ports were loaded with oligomycin,
  an inhibitor of oxidative metabolism that maximizes glycolytic metabolism (final
  concentration 1.0 μM), carbonyl cyanide _p_-[trifluoromethoxy]-phenyl-hydrazone
  (FCCP), an uncoupler of electron transport that maximizes oxygen consumption (final
  concentration 1.25 μM) and rotenone in 1.0 μM final concentration.
- Extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) and oxygen consumption rate (OCR) were measured
  using the SeaHorse XF24 Extracellular Analyzer from SeaHorse Bioscience (Billerica,
  MA).
- ECAR and OCAR were measured over a 96-min time period.

- 'Notes: _p_ &lt; 0.05, _p_ &lt; 0.01 and _p_ &lt; 0.001.'
- Following treatment described earlier, either oligomycin or 2-deoxyglucose was added
  to the cells to measure either glycolytic ATP production (oligomycin) or oxidative
  ATP content (2-deoxyglucose).
- The cells were lysed, and the ATP-containing supernatant was recovered.
- ATP was measured using the ATP bioluminescence reagent from Sigma (St. Louis, MO)
  per manufacturer's protocol.
- Cell density was determined by staining cells with trypan blue from Sigma (St Louis,
  MO) with cell density estimated using a Countess™ cell quantification system from
  Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA).
- Following treatment as described earlier, culture media was removed and replaced
  with buffer-free DMEM from SeaHorse Bioscience (Billerica, MA) and allowed to incubate
  for 2 hr.
- Media were collected, and lactate was measured in triplicate using the Lactate Assay
  Kit II from Sigma (St. Louis, MO) using Wallac Victor3V 1420 Multilabel Counter
  from PerkinElmer (Waltham, MA).
- Cells were transfected with an NFκB GFP-linked reporter system from Qiagen (Valencia,
  CA) before treatment as described earlier.
- NFκB activity was measured by quantifying the fluorescence via microscopy using
  five replicates per treatment.
- Media and treatment were replaced with media containing 10% WST1 and incubated for
  1 hr.
- Fluorescence was measured using Wallac Victor3V 1420 Multilabel Counter (PerkinElmer,
  Waltham, MA).
- To assess sensitivity to glucose deprivation, media were replaced with glucose-free
  DMEM.
- Viability was assessed every 24 hr for 7 days total.
- Cell metabolism, RNA expression, microscopy and cell viability were analyzed using
  ANOVA and Tukey's multiple comparisons test using Prism Software from GraphPad (La
  Jolla, CA).
- Values of _p &lt;_ 0.05 indicated statistical significance in all tests used.
- To test if low-level inflammation induces aerobic glycolysis, we treated MCF-10a
  or MCF-7 cells with either TNF-α at 10 ng/ml with or without curcumin at 5 or 10
  μM.
- We measured glycolysis by monitoring the ECAR of cells in culture over 96 min (normalized
  to 50,000 cells).
- Baseline glycolysis measurements were taken for the initial 24 min followed by the
  addition of oligomycin, FCCP and rotenone at various time points.
- Oligomycin is a mitochondrial ATPase inhibitor; therefore, this drug forces cells
  to maximize glycolytic capacity to sustain ATP production.
- FCCP is a disruptor of mitochondrial membrane potential that forces cells into a
  state of maximum respiration.
- Rotenone inhibits NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, which completely stops mitochondrial
  respiration.
- The ECAR and OCR were measured during these treatments.
- Treatment of MCF-10a and MCF-7 cells with 10 ng/ml TNF-α significantly increased
  both baseline glycolysis (preoligomycin injection) and peak glycolytic capacity
  (postoligomycin injection; Figs.
- 1_a_ and 1_b_).
- Treatment of MCF-10a with TNF-α plus 5 or 10 μM curcumin restored both basal and
  peak glycolysis to normal levels (Fig.
- 1_a_).
- Treatment of MCF-7 cells with TNF-α plus 5 μM curcumin partially restored glycolysis
  to normal basal levels; however, 10 μM curcumin did not.
- TNF-α treatment significantly increased ECAR following treatment with FCCP, which
  was partially rescued by curcumin.
- OCR did not vary between any treatment in either cell model (data not shown).
- To further validate the induction of Warburg-like metabolism by TNF-α, we measured
  lactate export following treatment.
- Cells treated with TNF-α exhibited significantly greater lactate export compared
  to control, which was completely rescued in both cell models by curcumin (Fig.
- 1_c_).
- Interestingly, both glycolytic and oxidative ATP production were elevated in MCF-7
  cells treated with TNF-α, but ATP production was unaltered in MCF-10a cells (Fig.
- 1_d_).
- TNF-α-induced aerobic glycolysis led us to measure changes in GLUT1 RNA and protein
  expression.
- Treatment with TNF-α significantly increased the expression levels of GLUT1 RNA
  and protein in both MCF-10a and MCF-7 (Figs.
- 2_a_ and 2_b,_ respectively), with TNF-α leading to appreciable membrane localization
  in MCF-10a cells (Fig.
- 2_c_).
- MCF-10a cells treated with TNF-α plus 5 μM curcumin and 10 μM curcumin significantly
  reduced GLUT1 RNA levels compared to TNF-α-treated cells (Fig.
- 2).
- Treatment of MCF-7 cells with TNF-α plus 5 μM curcumin significantly reduced GLUT1
  RNA levels compared to TNF-α treatment.
- Concurrent treatment of MCF-7 cells with TNF-α and curcumin at 5 or 10 μM completely
  rescued TNF-α-induced GLUT1 protein expression to control levels.
- Figure 2\.
- GLUT1 expression (green) and DAPI (blue).
- (_a_) Relative RNA and protein expression from MCF-10a cells is treated for 96 hr
  with DMSO (Control), TNF-α 10 ng/ml with or without curcumin at 5 or 10 μM.
- (_b_) Relative RNA and protein expression of MCF-7 cells following treatment as
  described.
- (_c_) Confocal microscopy of GLUT1 protein expression from MCF-10a cells (top row)
  and MCF-7 cells (bottom row) is treated as described earlier.
- 'Notes: _p_ &lt; 0.05, _p_ &lt; 0.01 and _p_ &lt; 0.001.'
- Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 (PGC1) is a major
  controller of mitochondrial biosynthesis, warranting our investigation of its expression
  in TNF-α-treated cells.
- Treatment of MCF-10a cells with TNF-α significantly decreased PGC1 levels, which
  were partially rescued by concurrent treatment with curcumin (Fig.
- 3_a_).
- These observations were also seen in MCF-7 cells, which showed complete rescuing
  with curcumin 5 μM (Fig.
- 3_a_).
- To measure the effects of TNF-α on mitochondrial content, we stained cells with
  either cytochrome C or Mitotracker Green, which revealed a significant decrease
  in mitochondrial content in both cell models following TNF-α treatment compared
  to control (Figs.
- 3_b_ and 3_c_).
- The addition of curcumin at 5 or 10 μM with concurrent TNF-α treatment partially
  rescued the diminished mitochondrial content in MCF-10a cells in a significant and
  dose-dependent manner (Fig.
- 3_c_).
- Treatment of MCF-7 cells with 5 or 10 μM curcumin exhibited either total or partial
  rescuing of TNFα suppression of mitochondrial content (Figs.
- 3_b_ and 3_c_).

- 'Notes: _p_ &lt; 0.05, _p_ &lt; 0.01 and _p_ &lt; 0.001.'
- To evaluate the effects of TNF-α on viability, we measured proliferative viability
  via WST-1 assay.
- WST-1 end-point assay showed no statistical difference in cell viability following
  treatment with 10 ng/ml TNFα with or without curcumin at 5 or 10 μM in standard
  media for 24, 48, 72 or 96 hr (Supporting Information Figs.
- 1 and 2).
- To assess effects of TNF-α on glucose deprivation, cells were treated as described
  earlier for 96 hr, followed by respective treatment of cells in either glucose supplemented
  or in glucose-free media.
- Cell viability was measured using the Trypan blue dye exclusion assay.
- MCF-7 cells treated with TNF-α had a significant reduction in viability at 120,
  144 and 168 hr in glucose-free media (Supporting Information Fig.
- 1).
- Both 5 and 10 μM curcumin partially rescued the drop in viability after 48 hr (Supporting
  Information Fig.
- 1).
- Neither treatment significantly altered viability when cells were grown in glucose-supplemented
  media at 120, 144 and 168 hr.
- To verify the effects of TNFα on NFκB activation, we used an NFκB-GFP reporter system
  measured by microscopy and quantified using ImageJ.
- MCF-10a cells exhibited a low sensitivity to TNF-α, while TNF-α-treated MCF-7 cells
  showed significant NFκB activation, which was partially rescued by curcumin at 24-hr
  posttreatment (Supporting Information Fig.
- 3).
- Aerobic glycolysis is a phenomenon that has been demonstrated in nearly all cancer
  types.
- '[1] Previous studies have shown that expression of common oncogenes can induce
  aerobic glycolysis.'
- '[4] Inflammatory gene expression signature in CAFs has also been shown to have
  an effect on cancer cell metabolism[5]; however, the direct effect of an inflammatory
  microenvironment on the metabolism of cancer cells is not known.'
- Our study identified a microenvironmental factor (low-level TNF-α, a mediator of
  inflammation) as a direct inducer of aerobic glycolysis (and resulting lactate export)
  and inhibitor of mitochondrial biosynthesis in malignant and nonmalignant breast
  epithelial cell lines.
- It is striking that a tumor-like metabolism can be activated in nonmalignant (MCF-10a)
  cells by an extracellular signal in the absence of oncogene expression.
- This suggests that this emerging Hallmark of Cancer may be activated early in tumorigenesis,
  possibly before the occurrence of mutations.
- Further investigations are needed to determine if this metabolic switch occurs early
  in tumorigenesis _in vivo,_ because this may have implications for the detection
  of premalignant tissue through increased uptake of F18FDG.
- The results generated in premalignant breast cells might also have implications
  for breast cancer prevention.
- We demonstrated that curcumin can return elevated glycolytic levels induced by TNF-α
  to those in control MCF-10a cells.
- We also demonstrated that curcumin can prevent the TNF-α-induced drop in mitochondrial
  content, while combination omega 3 fatty acids do not have the ability of such rescue
  (data not shown).
- Certainly, the use of curcumin as a therapeutic agent is confounded by its vast
  biological activity, much of which remains unelucidated.
- Further studies are needed to determine if curcumin affects inflammation-induced
  aerobic glycolysis _in vivo_.
- The effects of TNF-α on the metabolism of malignant cells (MCF-7) also have significant
  implications.
- Our study demonstrates that microenvironmental factors such as inflammation can
  exacerbate aerobic glycolysis in malignant cells.
- Furthermore, this effect can be reversed with the natural dietary compound, curcumin.
- These observations are noteworthy, because they demonstrate that the phenomenon
  of aerobic glycolysis may be more plastic than previously recognized.
- The Warburg effect in cancer metabolism primarily focuses on the increase in aerobic
  glycolysis.
- Because of this focus, it is a common misconception that cancer cells upregulate
  aerobic glycolysis at the expense of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation.
- '[17] The current study demonstrates that TNF-α increases glucose uptake and aerobic
  glycolysis, yet oxygen consumption remains the same.'
- Interestingly, mitochondrial content is significantly decreased, indicating that
  the remaining mitochondria are functioning at a higher capacity to compensate for
  the loss of mitochondrial content.
- This observation is interesting in light of other reports that demonstrate that
  c-Myc can induce aerobic glycolysis and increase mitochondrial function, independent
  of mitochondrial mass.
- '[4] These observations suggest that induction of aerobic glycolysis, whether it
  occurs by oncogene expression or microenvironmental factors, may increase overall
  mitochondrial function.'
- This work uniquely identifies a microenvironmental factor, low-level inflammation,
  as a modulator of energy homeostasis in malignant and nonmalignant breast cells.
- Interestingly, many of the alterations of energy homeostasis can be reversed by
  the addition of curcumin but not other anti-inflammatory agents such as omega 3
  fatty acids (EPA/DHA; data not shown).
- Although treatment with curcumin at 5 or 10 μM reversed much of the TNF-α-induced
  effects, 5 μM curcumin was the most consistent rescuing treatment.
- This demonstration that energy metabolism can be modified through a balance of inflammatory
  and anti-inflammatory agents provides evidence of a more adaptable model of energy
  homeostasis in cancer.
