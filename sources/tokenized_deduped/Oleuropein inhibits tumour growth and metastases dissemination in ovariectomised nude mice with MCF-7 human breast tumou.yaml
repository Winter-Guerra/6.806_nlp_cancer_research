- Oleuropein (OL), the precursor of olive oil secoiridoids, has been shown to possess
  a strong _in vitro_ anti-cancer activity.
- The _in vivo_ effect of OL on a BC animal model consisting of MCF-7 cells xenograft
  growth in ovariectomised nude mice was investigated.
- After subcutaneous implantation of 17-Î² E2 pellet, BC xenografts were established
  by injection of MCF-7 cells into the mouse mammary fat pads.
- Animals, divided into two groups, were fed a basal diet (BD) and an OL enriched
  diet (OLD, 125 mg OL/kg of diet).
- Animals in the BD group lost weight more consistent than those of the OLD group
  while the MCF-7 xenograft growth was faster in the BD group compared to the OLD
  group.
- Tumour volume reached about 1300 mm3 28 and 35 days after MCF-7 cells injection
  in the BD and OLD groups, respectively.
- At these times the animals were sacrificed for the evaluation of pulmonary metastases.
- OL prevented both peripulmonary and parenchyma lung metastases in a highly significant
  manner.
- These data demonstrate for the first time a strong _in vivo_ chemopreventive activity
  of OL on BC.
