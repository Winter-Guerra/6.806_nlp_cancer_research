- (Z)-3,5,4'-Trimethoxystilbene is a natural polyphenol present in five different
  plants, Virola cuspidata, Virola elongata, Centipeda minima, Schoenus nigricans
  and Rheum undulatum.
- This molecule was prepared in a three-step sequence in good overall yield.
- The isomerisation from the (E)- to (Z)-isomer is performed using UV irradiation.
- Biological investigations were conducted on a human colon cancer cell line (Caco-2)
  with anti-mitotic activities.
- Growth was completely arrested at an added 0.4 microM level of (Z)-3,5,4'-trimethoxystilbene.
- This agent is 100-fold more active than resveratrol or (E)-3,5,4'-trihydroxystilbene,
  and the mechanism of this process involves an inhibition of tubulin polymerisation
  in a dose dependent manner.
