- This study investigated dietary fiber intake in association with serum estrogen
  levels in naturally postmenopausal Latina women with a wide range of fiber intake.
- Estrone (E1), estradiol (E2), and sex-hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) were measured
  in 242 women.
- Associations between estrogen levels and intake of dietary fiber, including insoluble
  and soluble fractions, quantified from a food frequency questionnaire, were examined.
- The biomarker enterolactone was also measured.
- After adjustment for age, weight, and other nondietary factors, dietary fiber intake
  was inversely associated with E1 and E2; there was a 22% and 17% decrease (2Ptrend=0.023
  and 0.045) among subjects in the highest quintile of intake compared with the lowest.
- Fitting dietary fiber together with soluble and insoluble nonstarch polysaccharides
  (NSP) showed a much greater decrease in E1 and E2 (47% and 41%, respectively) while
  increased soluble NSP intake showed increases in E1 and E2 (64% and 69%, respectively).
- Two foods, avocado and grapefruit, showed significant positive associations with
  E1 (2Ptrend=0.029 and 0.015, respectively).
- This study suggests that different components of dietary fiber may have very significant
  different effects on serum estrogen levels.
- The suggestive findings relating increased estrogen levels to avocado and grapefruit
  intakes need confirmation.
