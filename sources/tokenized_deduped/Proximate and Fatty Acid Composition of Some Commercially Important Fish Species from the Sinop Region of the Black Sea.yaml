- The proximate and fatty acid compositions of the commercially important fish species
  (_Engraulis encrasicolus_, _Alosa alosa_, _Belone belone_, _Scorpaena porcus_, _Pomatomus
  saltatrix_, _Mullus barbatus_) from the Sinop region of the Black Sea were examined.
- The fat contents ranged from 1.26% (for scorpion fish) to 18.12% (for shad).
- The protein contents were min 14.54% (for red mullet) and maximum 20.26% (for belone).
- The fatty acid compositions of the fish ranged from 27.83 to 35.91% for saturated
  fatty acids, 19.50–33.80% for monounsaturated fatty acids and 15.25–40.02% for polyunsaturated
  fatty acids.
- Among the saturated fatty acids, palmitic acid (16:0) (17.75–22.20%) was the dominant
  fatty acid for all the fish species.
- As a second saturated fatty acid, myristic acid (14:0) was observed in four of the
  fish species and its content ranged from 4.72 to 7.31%.
- Whereas, for the other two fish species, the second saturated fatty acid was stearic
  acid (18:0) ranging between 4.54 and 10.64%.
- Among the monounsaturated fatty acids, those occurring in the highest proportions
  were oleic acid (18:1n-9c) (11.67–22.45%) and palmitoleic acid (16:1) (4.50–9.40%).
- Docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3) (5.41–28.52%), eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5n-3) (4.68–11.06)
  and linoleic acid (18:2n-6) (1.38–3.49%) were dominant polyunsaturated fatty acids,
  respectively.
- All the species, in particular the belone, the anchovy and the shad had high levels
  of the n-3 series.
- Fatty acids serve a wide variety of metabolic functions, critical to all forms of
  life.
- Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), particularly the n-3 and n-6 series, play an
  important role in non-energy-producing biological functions.
- n-3 PUFA, namely eicosapentaenoic acid, 20:5n-3 (EPA) docosapentaenoic acid, 22:5n-3
  (DPA) and docosahexaenoic acid, 22:6n-3 (DHA) plays numerous roles within the human
  body [1].
- The health benefits of the long-chain n-3 PUFA such as 20:5n-3 and 22:6n-3 have
  been well observed in scientific studies such as the prevention or reduction of
  human coronary artery disease [2–7], a significant decrease in total cholesterol
  and high density lipoprotein levels [8], in peripheral arterial disease, improvement
  in endothelial functions [9] improvement in depressive symptoms in parkinsonian
  patients [10], a reduction in the risk of breast cancer [11, 12] and a reduction
  in the risk of prostate cancer [13].
- Long-chain n-3 PUFA cannot be easily synthesized by humans and must be ingested
  in the diet [14].
- Most of the PUFA of fish lipids occur as the n-3 type.
- The contents of different fatty acids in fish lipids depend on numerous factors,
  such as diet, the geographic location, the environmental temperature, the time of
  year, the body length, the lipid content, etc.
- '[15].'
- Sinop is one of the important port cities on the Black Sea.
- In particular, anchovy is of utmost importance for commercial fishing in this area.
- Additionally, the other commercial fish species in this region are bonito, shad,
  belone, turbot, scorpion fish, horse mackerel, blue fish, red mullet and whiting.
- Knowledge of the fatty acid composition and nutritional value of commercially important
  fish species is needed.
- Therefore, this paper presents the fatty acid compositions and other nutritional
  values of a variety of commercial fish species found in the Sinop region of the
  Black Sea.
- For this research, 2 kg each of six different species of commercially important
  fish were chosen and purchased from the local fish market in January 2011.
- These were anchovy (_Engraulis encrasicolus_), shad (_Alosa alosa_), belone (_Belone
  belone_), scorpion fish (_Scorpaena porcus_), bluefish (_Pomatomus saltatrix_),
  and red mullet (_Mullus barbatus_).
- The average weights of the fish were 6.18 ± 0.3 g for anchovy, 229.60 ± 10.83 g
  for shad, 73.31 ± 4.75 g for belone, 87.82 ± 9.91 g for scorpion fish, 110.37 ±
  8.17 g for bluefish, and 10.29 ± 0.56 g for red mullet.
- A minimum of nine fish from each individual species were gutted, filleted and minced
  for analysis.
- The moisture and ash contents were determined as described by AOAC [16], and the
  protein content was determined by the Kjeldahl method [16].
- The crude lipid content was performed by acid digestion prior to petroleum ether
  extraction (boiling point 40–60 °C) in a Soxtec system [17].
- These analyses were performed in triplicate.
- After the fish carbohydrate value was calculated [carbohydrate value = 100 − (water
  + lipid + protein + ash)] the energy value was calculated according to the Atwater
  method [18].
- The fatty acid content was determined using the IUPAC II.D.19 method [19].
- The fatty acids were analyzed using a Perkin Elmer Auto System XL gas chromatograph
  (Perkin-Elmer, Beaconsfield, UK) equipped with a SP–2330 column and a flame ionization
  detector.
- The separation of the fatty acids methyl esters was achieved using a fused silica
  capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.20 μm film thickness).
- The oven temperature was set at 120 °C for 2 min, then increased to 220 °C with
  a ramp rate of 5 °C/min, and then held for 15 min.
- The injector and detector temperatures were maintained at 240 and 250 °C, respectively.
- The carrier gas was helium at 10 psi with a split ratio of 1/50.
- The air and hydrogen pressures were 338 and 45 ml/min, respectively.
- The results were determined by the percentage of each fatty acid with respect to
  the total fatty acids.
- The fatty acid analyses were conducted in two replicates and the results were expressed
  in GC area % as mean values ± standard error.
- For identification of the fatty acids, their retention times were compared to those
  of the standard methyl esters (Supelco 37-Component FAME Mix).
- For conversion of the percentile values to units of weight, the formula recommended
  originally by Weihrauch et al.
- '[20] and then Paul and Southgate [21] and Soriguer et al.'
- '[22] was employed.'
- 'The formula for fish is as follows: Factor (fish) = 0.933 − (0.143/total fat).'
- The conversion factor (CF) for the n-3 FA of _E.
- 'encrasicolus_: CF = 0.933 − (0.143/13.90) = 0.92; (0.92 × 28.40)/100 = 0.26 g/100
  g of n-3 (Table 3).'
- The results of the analyses were presented as means ± standard errors.
- Statistical analysis was conducted with the Minitab Statistical Software package
  (Minitab Release, 13).
- A one-way analysis of the variance (ANOVA) was used to verify the differences between
  the species and significance of those differences were tested with the Tukey Test.
- The significance level was _P_ &lt; 0.05.
- "Proximate composition of six fish species (expressed on a wet weight basis (%))
  \ \n\n\n\nWithin a column values with different superscript letters are significantly
  different (_P_ &lt; 0.05)\n\n\nThe main chemical components of fish meat are water,
  crude protein, and lipids."
- Together they make up approximately 98% of the total mass of flesh.
- The other constituents, i.e., carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals, are present
  in minor quantities.
- The contents of the main components in the fish body depend primarily on the species,
  the stage of maturity, the sex, the spawning cycle, the environment, the season,
  and the nutritional condition of the animal [15, 23, 24].
- Flesh from healthy fish contains 60–84% water, 15–24% protein and 0.1–22% fat; minerals
  usually constitute 1–2%.
- The proportions of the constituents are species-specific and the main variations
  between species are in the fat content.
- Fish are often classified according to fat content.
- Lean fish have &lt;0.5% fat, semi-fat fish contain 0.5–2% and fatty fish have more
  than 2% [25].
- In this study, the lipid content ranged from 1.26% for scorpion fish to 18.12% for
  shad.
- The scorpion fish could be classified as a semi-fat fish.
- All the remaining fish could be classified as fatty fish.
- However, between the fatty fish, the highest fat content was determined in the shad
  flesh (_P_ &lt; 0.05).
- The fat contents were shad &gt; anchovy &gt; blue fish &gt; red mullet &gt; belone
  &gt; scorpion fish (_P_ &lt; 0.05).
- Sorting by the moisture content was scorpion fish &gt; red mullet ≥ belone &gt;
  blue fish &gt; anchovy &gt; shad (_P_ &lt; 0.05).
- In general, there is an inverse relationship between the amount of fat and moisture
  in the flesh.
- As shown in Table 1, the moisture content in deep water species (scorpion fish and
  red mullet) was more than in the pelagic species.
- The protein content tends to vary much less widely from one species to another.
- Most fish contain approximately 20% protein [25].
- Also, in this research, the protein content of the fish varied from 14.54 to 20.26%.
- The ash content ranged from 0.76% for the blue fish to 1.25% for the belone.
- The major carbohydrate in fish muscle is glycogen, which is a polymer of glucose.
- A typical muscle in a live fish may contain between 0.1 and 1% glycogen [25].
- In this research, the lowest carbohydrate content was obtained from the red mullet
  (0.66%) however, it was similar to the carbohydrate value of the other fish except
  for the anchovy (_P_ &lt; 0.05).
- The energy value of the fish ranged from 82.84 to 243.74 cal (_P_ &lt; 0.05), and
  the fat content together with the energy value, was determined as a linearly relationship
  (_r_ = 0.99).
- Similar food compositions for the fish observed in this research have been determined
  by several other researchers [26–30].
- "Fatty acid composition of fish species (% fatty acids methyl ester/total of the
  methyl esters)  \n\n\n\n\nWithin a row values with different superscript letters
  are significantly different (_P_ &lt; 0.05)\n\nThe fatty acids composition of the
  fish species ranged from 27.83 to 35.91% saturated fatty acid (SFA), 19.50–33.80%
  monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) and 15.25–40.02% PUFA."
- It was observed that the proportion of these fatty acids changed significantly between
  the six fish species (_P_ &lt; 0.05).
- Among them, those occurring in the highest proportions were myristic acid (14:0),
  palmitic acid (16:0) (PAM), stearic acid (18:0) (STA), palmitoleic acid (16:1),
  oleic acid (18:1n-9) (OLA), linoleic acid (18:2n-6) (LNA), alpha-linolenic acid
  (18:3n-3) (ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5n-3) (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid
  (22:6n-3) (DHA).
- These results are in line with previous studies on the fatty acids of other species
  [27–29, 31–38].
- It was also observed that the proportion of these fatty acids vary among the species.
- The SFA values were significantly different (_P_ &lt; 0.05) for the six fish species.
- The highest SFA value was obtained from the scorpion fish (35.91%) whose fat content
  was the lowest in all fish.
- This was followed by anchovy (35.07%), blue fish (32.86%) and red mullet (30.46%),
  belone (29.56%) and shad (27.83%).
- Güner et al.
- '[27] reported SFA ratios 40.77% for anchovy, 38.16% for red mullet, 35.87% for
  belone, 31.77% for shad.'
- SFA ratios of anchovy by Kaya and Turan [28] were declared as 38.62, 35.20, and
  33.57% in November, December and January, respectively.
- Öksüz and Özyılmaz [29] reported that SFA ratios of anchovy ranged from 37.91 to
  34.04% (from October to April).
- Tanakol et al.
- '[31] determined SFA ratios 42.2% for anchovy, 34.4% for bluefish and 34.7% for
  belone.'
- Bayır et al.
- '[32] found SFA ratios in bluefish, anchovy and belone of 38.35, 37.81, and 28.89%,
  respectively.'
- Palmitic acid was the primary SFA, contributing to 57–66% of the total SFA content
  of lipids for all the fish species.
- These result is in line with previous studies on the fatty acids of other species
  [27–29, 31, 32].
- The highest 16:0 content was detected in the scorpion fish, whereas the lowest value
  was found in the shad.
- The palmitic acid content in the anchovy and red mullet; belone and the blue fish
  were similar (_P_ &gt; 0.05).
- Myristic acid was the secondary fatty acid for the pelagic fish species (anchovy
  &gt; blue fish &gt; belone &gt; shad, _P_ &lt; 0.05), whereas 18:0 was the secondary
  fatty acid for the deep water species (10.64% for scorpion fish, 4.54% for red mullet).
- The MUFA values were significantly different (_P_ &lt; 0.05) for all six fish species.
- The highest MUFA value was obtained from the red mullet (33.80%), followed by the
  blue fish (30.50%), belone (30.34%) and then the shad (30.26%) (_P_ &gt; 0.05),
  whereas the lowest value was found in the anchovy (19.50%) (_P_ &lt; 0.05).
- This result is in accordance with Güner et al.
- '[27] who found that anchovy showed the lowest percentage (24.80%) of MUFA in other
  fish (red mullet, belone and shad).'
- Öksüz and Özyılmaz [29] reported monthly changes (25.91–31.51%) in the levels of
  the MUFA component throughout the catching season of anchovy.
- Oleic acid was the most represented of the MUFA, accounting for 60–74% of the total
  MUFA for all the fish.
- The highest 18:1n-9 contents were obtained from the blue fish (22.45%) and the shad
  (22.08%) (_P_ &gt; 0.05), followed by belone (20.68%), the scorpion fish (17.32%)
  and the red mullet (20.49%) (_P_ &gt; 0.05), whereas the lowest value was found
  in the anchovy (11.67%) (_P_ &lt; 0.05).
- While the highest 16:1 value was obtained from the red mullet (9.40%), the lowest
  value was found for the shad (4.50), and its contents were similar to the anchovy
  and the blue fish (_P_ &gt; 0.05).
- This two fatty acid (18:1n-9 and 16:1) were determined as the major fatty acids
  in MUFA in also other studies [27–29, 31, 32].
- The PUFA values were significantly different (_P_ &lt; 0.05) for the six fish species.
- The highest PUFA value was obtained from the belone (40.02%), followed by anchovy
  (32.43%), shad (27.67%), scorpion fish (26.38%), and blue fish (20.15%), whereas
  the lowest value was found in the red mullet (15.25%).
- This result is in accordance with Güner et al.
- '[27] who found that red mullet showed the lowest percentage (16.72%) of PUFA in
  other fish (belone, shad, and anchovy).'
- The major fatty acids, identified as PUFA, were 22:6n-3 and 20:5n-3, respectively.
- The highest proportion of 22:6n-3 in the total PUFA was obtained from the belone
  (71%), followed by shad (62%), blue fish (53%) and anchovy (49%), whereas, the scorpion
  fish (34%) and red mullet (35%) contained lower 22:6n-3 contents.
- Güner et al.
- '[27] also determined a lower 22:6n-3 content in red mullet than anchovy, belone
  and shad.'
- It was observed that the proportion of 22:6n-3 in the pelagic fish (belone, shad,
  blue fish and anchovy) was higher than those in the deep water fish (scorpion fish
  and red mullet).
- Similarly, the high proportion of 20:5n-3 was detected in the red mullet (36% of
  total PUFA) and anchovy (34%), followed by the scorpion fish (23%), blue fish (23%),
  shad (21%), whereas the belone (12%) contained lower 20:5n-3 than the other fish.
- However, the 20:5n-3 values were anchovy &gt; scorpion fish &gt; shad &gt; red mullet
  &gt; blue fish ≥ belone.
- The 20:5n-3 values in the fish (anchovy, red mullet, belone and shad) studied here
  were higher than those in the fish (anchovy, red mullet, belone and shad) studied
  by Güner et al.
- '[27].'
- Also, the 22:6n-3 values in red mullet, belone and shad except for anchovy were
  higher than those in the fish studied by Güner et al.
- '[27].'
- In the PUFA, the 18:2n-6 contents ranged from 1.38% (for red mullet) to 3.49% (for
  belone).
- The linoleic acid contents were similar to that of the anchovy (2.52%) with the
  scorpion fish at (2.41%), shad (2.16%) with blue fish (2.15%), (_P_ &gt; 0.05),
  whereas the 18:3n-3 contents were significantly different in all the fish species,
  with a content range from 0.41% (for red mullet) to 3.95% (for scorpion fish).
- The British Nutrition Foundation [39] recommended that people who have a balanced
  and healthy diet consume 0.2 g of EPA and DHA daily.
- The American Heart Association (AHA) recommends that all adults should include fish
  in their diet at least twice a week, especially oily fish [40–42], and for patients
  with documented coronary heart disease, the AHA recommends ≈ 1 g of EPA + DHA (combined)
  per day [40, 41].
- This may be obtained from the consumption of oily fish or from n-3 fatty acid capsules,
  although the decision to use the latter should be made in consultation with a physician
  [40, 41].
- As shown in Table 3, the highest EPA + DHA value was obtained from the belone (0.29),
  followed by anchovy (0.25) and shad (0.21), whereas the lowest values were found
  for the scorpion fish (0.12), blue fish (0.14) and red mullet (0.15).
- To meet the EPA and DHA recommendations according to the British Nutrition Foundation,
  100 g of belone, anchovy and shad is enough but scorpion fish, blue fish and red
  mullet should be consumed in amounts higher than 100 g. This research indicates
  that very oily fish such as anchovy and shad have more EPA + DHA than semi-fat fish
  such as scorpion fish.
- However, belone is shown to be a very good source of EPA + DHA, despite the low
  amount of fat (Table 3).
- In the present study, it was observed that all the species had high levels of the
  n-3 series, ranging from 11.60% for red mullet and 34.89% for belone (_P_ &lt; 0.05)
  (Table 2).
- However, the level of the n-6 series was detected as being low; ranging from 1.49%
  for the red mullet and 3.49% for belone.
- The level of the n-6 series of the shad, scorpion fish and blue fish were similar
  (_P_ &gt; 0.05).
- Excessive amounts of n-6 PUFA and a very high n-6/n-3 ratio, as is found in today’s
  Western diets, promote the pathogenesis of many diseases; including cardiovascular
  disease, hypertension, depression, cancer, and inflammatory and autoimmune diseases,
  whereas increased levels of n-3 PUFA (a low n-6/n-3 ratio) exert suppressive effects
  [1, 43–47].
- Because of the low content of n-6 fatty acids in marine fish, the ratio of the total
  n-3–n-6 fatty acids (essential fatty acid ratio) is high, varying from about 5,
  and reaching a ratio of more than 10 [48].
- In this research, the highest value of n-3/n-6 ratio was obtained from the shad
  (10.77), followed by belone (10.01) and anchovy (9.91), whereas the lowest values
  were detected in the scorpion fish (7.87), red mullet (7.79) and blue fish (7.27)
  (Table 2).
- In conclusion, this research indicated that the belone, anchovy and shad in particular,
  are excellent food sources for EPA + DHA.
- In addition, the red mullet, blue fish and scorpion fish are also good sources of
  EPA + DHA.
