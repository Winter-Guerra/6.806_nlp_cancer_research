- 'Background/Aim: We evaluated whether low doses of the natural carotenoid fucoxanthin
  and/or of its metabolite fucoxanthinol are effective against proliferation of estrogen-sensitive
  MCF-7 and estrogen-resistant MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines.'
- 'Materials and Methods: These cell lines were stimulated with 10 to 20 μM fucoxanthin
  and/or fucoxanthinol, followed by cell viability assays, Annexin V immunofluorescence
  to evaluate apoptosis, as well as mRNA and protein extractions for changes in nuclear
  factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) members'' expressions
  and nuclear translocations.'
- 'Results: Fucoxanthin and fucoxanthinol reduced the viability of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231
  cells in a time-dependent manner as a result of increased apoptosis.'
- In both cell lines, modulatory actions of fucoxanthinol on members of the NF-κB
  pathway were more pronounced than that of fucoxanthin.
- 'Conclusion: In MDA-MB-231 cells, fucoxanthinol reduced nuclear levels of NF-κB
  members'' p65, p52 and RelB.'
- Fucoxanthinol and fucoxanthin could be effective for the treatment and/or prevention
  of breast cancer.
