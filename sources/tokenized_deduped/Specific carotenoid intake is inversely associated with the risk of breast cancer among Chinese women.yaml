- The protective effect of dietary carotenoid intake on the risk of breast cancer
  is inconclusive.
- Moreover, data on dietary carotenoids in relation to breast cancer in non-Western
  populations are scarce.
- The aim of the present study was to examine the association between dietary carotenoid
  intake and the risk of breast cancer among Chinese women.
- A total of 561 cases and 561 controls who were frequency matched by age (5-year
  interval) and residence were recruited in the present case-control study.
- Dietary intake information was collected by a face-to-face interview using a validated
  FFQ.
- The OR and 95 % CI were assessed by multivariate logistic regression after adjusting
  for various potential confounders.
- An inverse association was observed between the consumption of α-carotene, β-carotene,
  β-cryptoxanthin and lutein/zeaxanthin and the risk of breast cancer.
- The multivariate-adjusted OR for the highest quartile of intake compared with the
  lowest quartile of intake were 0·61 (95 % CI 0·43, 0·88) for α-carotene, 0·54 (95
  % CI 0·38, 0·78) for β-carotene, 0·38 (95 % CI 0·26, 0·52) for β-cryptoxanthin and
  0·49 (95 % CI 0·34, 0·71) for lutein/zeaxanthin.
- Lycopene intake was not found to be associated with the risk of breast cancer, with
  the adjusted OR of 0·89 (95 % CI 0·61, 1·30).
- These inverse associations were more evident among pre-menopausal women and women
  who were exposed to second-hand smoke.
- The protective effect of specific carotenoid intake was observed for all subtypes
  of hormone receptor status of breast cancer.
- The present study indicated that a greater intake of specific carotenoids was associated
  with a decreased risk of breast cancer among Chinese women residing in Guangdong.
