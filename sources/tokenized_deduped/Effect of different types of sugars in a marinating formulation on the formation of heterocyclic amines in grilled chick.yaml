- The aim of the study was to determine the effect of different types of sugar on
  the formation of heterocyclic amines (HCA) in marinated grilled chicken.
- Chicken breast samples were marinated with table sugar, brown sugar, and honey for
  24 h at 4 °C.
- The internal temperature, weight loss, free amino acids, sugars, and HCA were determined.
- The concentrations of all types of HCA (except IQx) in samples that were marinated
  with table sugar were significantly higher (_p &lt; _0.006) than brown sugar; whereas
  those were marinated with honey had the lowest HCA concentrations.
- A substantial reduction in the concentration of MeIQ, PhIP, DiMeIQx, IQ, IQx, and
  norharman was achieved in chicken marinated with honey.
- A correlation study indicated that adding honey into the recipe retarded the formation
  of most HCA (MeIQ, DiMeIQx, IQ, IQx, norharman, and harman), whereas table sugars
  enhanced the formation of all HCA except norharman, harman, and AÎ±C.
