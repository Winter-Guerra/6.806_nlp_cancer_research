- Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) can induce cell damage by generating reactive oxygen species
  (ROS), resulting in DNA damage and cell death.
- The aim of this study is to elucidate the protective effects of fisetin (3,7,3′,4′,-tetrahydroxy
  flavone) against H2O2-induced cell damage.
- Fisetin reduced the level of superoxide anion, hydroxyl radical in cell free system,
  and intracellular ROS generated by H2O2.
- Moreover, fisetin protected against H2O2-induced membrane lipid peroxidation, cellular
  DNA damage, and protein carbonylation, which are the primary cellular outcomes of
  H2O2 treatment.
- Furthermore, fisetin increased the level of reduced glutathione (GSH) and expression
  of glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit, which is decreased by H2O2.
- Conversely, a GSH inhibitor abolished the cytoprotective effect of fisetin against
  H2O2-induced cells damage.
- Taken together, our results suggest that fisetin protects against H2O2-induced cell
  damage by inhibiting ROS generation, thereby maintaining the protective role of
  the cellular GSH system.
- Flavonoids are a group of low-molecular weight polyphenolic compounds synthesized
  by plants.
- Many of these compounds exhibit a wide range of biological activities, including
  antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-tumor effects (Middleton et al.
- 2000; Beecher 2003; Guajardo-Flores et al.
- 2013).
- Fisetin (3,7,3′,4′,-tetrahydroxy flavone) is widely distributed among fruits and
  vegetables and is found in plant tissues at concentrations of 2–160 μg/g (Arai et
  al.
- 2000).
- Fisetin exhibits a wide variety of activities, including anti-cancer (Sung et al.
- 2007), anti-angiogenic (Fotsis et al.
- 1998), neuroprotective (Zbarsky et al.
- 2005), neurotrophic (Maher et al.
- 2006), radioprotective (Piao et al.
- 2013), and antioxidant (Hanneken et al.
- 2006) effects.
- Reactive oxygen species (ROS) cause oxidative modifications to DNA, proteins, lipids,
  and small intracellular molecules.
- Lipids, including pulmonary surfactants, react with ROS to produce lipid peroxides,
  which cause increased membrane permeability and inactivation of surfactants (Yang
  et al.
- 2007).
- In turn, reaction of ROS with cellular proteins leads to decreased protein synthesis
  due to the modification of proteins involved in translation and translocation, ultimately
  resulting in impaired cellular metabolism (Tuder et al.
- 2003).
- In addition, ROS damage nucleic acids by modifying purine and pyrimidine bases and
  by causing DNA strand breakage (Dizdaroglu et al.
- 2002).
- The oxidative stress induced by the overproduction of ROS has been associated with
  many clinical conditions including cancer, asthma, cystic fibrosis, ischemia-reperfusion
  injury, drug-induced toxicity, and aging (Nguyen et al.
- 2003; Di Pietro et al.
- 2013; Jezierska-Drutel et al.
- 2013; Wang et al.
- 2013).
- Glutathione is the most prevalent low-molecular weight antioxidant in cells.
- Reduced glutathione (GSH) protects cellular constituents from oxidative damage,
  either by reacting directly with oxidants or acting as a substrate for radical scavenging
  by glutathione peroxidase (Beutler 1989).
- Notably, decreased GSH concentrations are associated with cell damage (Zhou et al.
- 2013), depressed immunity (Morris et al.
- 2013), and cataracts (Chevez-Barrios et al.
- 2000; Chamberlain et al.
- 2009).
- Moreover, GSH depletion increases the susceptibility of cells to stress-induced
  cell death (Guaiquil et al.
- 2001; Liu et al.
- 2001; Dukhande et al.
- 2013).
- Our results demonstrate that fisetin protects cells from H2O2-induced damage by
  scavenging ROS and inducing cellular GSH systems.

  mM Na-EDTA, 10 mM Tris, 1% Trion X-100, and 10% DMSO; pH 10) for 1 h at 4°C.
- The slides were then placed in a gel electrophoresis apparatus containing 300 mM
  NaOH and 10 mM Na-EDTA (pH 13) for 40 min to allow for DNA unwinding and expression
  of alkali-labile damage.
- Next, an electrical field was applied (300 mA, 25 V) for 20 min at 4°C to draw the
  negatively charged DNA toward the anode.
- After electrophoresis, the slides were washed three times for 5 min at 4°C in a

- We recently reported that fisetin exhibited cytotoxicity at concentrations higher
  than 2.5 μg/ml in V79-4 cells (Piao et al.

- Therefore, 2.5 μg/ml was chosen as the optimal dose of fisetin for further study.
- First, we investigated the effect of fisetin on scavenging of superoxide anion and
  hydroxyl radical.
- It was used ESR spectrometry to detect the superoxide anion generated by xanthine
  and xanthine oxidase in a cell-free system.
- No signal was observed for the control and fisetin at 2.5 μg/ml; however, the signal
  of the superoxide anion increased to 3858 in the xanthine and xanthine oxidase systems.
- Fisetin treatment decreased this signal to 2949 Fig.
- 1_A_ .
- Next, hydroxyl radical generated by the Fenton reaction (FeSO4 \+ H2O2) in a cell-free
  system were detected by ESR spectrometry.
- No signal was observed for the control and fisetin at 2.5 μg/ml; however, the signal
  of the hydroxyl radical increased to 3791 in the FeSO4 \+ H2O2 system.

- H2O2-induced damage to multiple cellular components is responsible for loss of cell
  viability.
- Therefore, we investigated the effect of fisetin on damage to membrane lipids, DNA,
  and proteins in H2O2-treated cells.
- The level of lipid peroxidation was increased in H2O2-treated cells, as revealed
  by visualization of the fluorescent probe DPPP by microscopy Fig.
- 2_A_ .
- However, fisetin prevented the H2O2-induced peroxidation of lipids.
- Likewise, the cellular concentration of 8-isoprostane significantly increased after
  H2O2 treatment, but this increase was prevented by fisetin Fig.
- 2_B_ .
- Next, we measured H2O2-induced DNA damage using an alkaline comet assay.

  by visualization of the fluorescent probe CMAC by microscopy Fig.
- 3_A_ ; however, this decrease was prevented by fisetin.
- Likewise, H2O2 treatment reduced the intracellular GSH concentration, but fisetin
  prevented this decrease Fig.
- 3_B_ .
- Glutamate cysteine ligase, the rate-controlling enzyme in GSH synthesis (Krzywanski
  et al.
- 2004), is a heterodimer that can dissociate under non-denaturing conditions into
  catalytic (GCLC, 73 kDa) and modulatory (GCLM, 29 kDa) subunits, which are encoded
  by separate genes (Huang et al.
- 1993).
- GCLC contains the entire catalytic activity, which is regulated by its association
  with GCLM (Krzywanski et al.
- 2004).
- Western blotting analysis was performed to confirm the effect of fisetin on GSH
  at the level of a protein involved in GSH synthesis.
- Fisetin treatment increased GCLC expression in H2O2-treated cells Fig.
- 3_C_ .
- To determine the effect of GSH on fisetin-induced cytoprotection from H2O2-induced
  damage, cells were pre-treated with BSO, a specific inhibitor of GSH.

  which cells were incubated for a further 24 h. Levels of GSH were detected by using
  confocal microscopy after staining with the fluorescent probe CMAC (_A_) and by
  the GSH content assay (_B_).
- '_p_ &lt; 0.05, significantly different from control cells, and # _p_ &lt; 0.05,
  significantly different from H2O2-treated cells.'
- Cell lysates were subjected to Western blotting using a specific antibody against
  γ-GCLC (_C_).
- After treatment with BSO, fisetin, and/or H2O2, cell viability was determined by
  the MTT assay (_D_).
- '_p_ &lt; 0.05, significantly different from control cells, # _p_ &lt; 0.05, significantly
  different from H2O2-treated cells, and ♦ _p_ &lt; 0.05, significantly different
  from fisetin + H2O2-treated cells.'
- Fisetin, a flavonoid compound with high trolox-equivalent antioxidant capacity,
  is hydrophobic, readily passes through cell membranes, and accumulates intracellularly,
  resulting in high antioxidant activity (Ishige et al.
- 2001).
- A previous study reported that low concentrations of flavonoids are protective in
  cells, whereas high concentrations cause DNA damage and apoptosis (Wätjen et al.
- 2005).
- In that report, treatment with 50–250 μM (about 15–70 μg/ml) fisetin induced cytotoxicity,
  DNA strand breaks, oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation, and caspase-3 activation,
  whereas treatment with fisetin at a concentration less than 50 μM significantly
  protected against the large number of DNA strand breaks caused by 500 μM H2O2 (Wätjen
  et al.
- 2005).
- However, in our study, fisetin exhibited cytotoxicity in V79-4 cells at concentrations
  higher than 2.5 μg/ml (Piao et al.
- 2013).
- This discrepancy of concentration may be due to cell type and/or culture condition.
- GSH systems play an important role in protecting cells against oxidative stress-induced
  cell death (von Montfort et al.
- 2012).
- Therefore, we investigated whether fisetin protects against cell damage by activating
  GSH systems.
- Fisetin decreased ROS levels and prevented the depletion of GSH induced by H2O2-induced
  cell damage.
- Fisetin increased the level of GSH and expression of γ-GCLC, which is reduced by
  H2O2.
- Conversely, a GSH inhibitor abolished the cytoprotective effect of fisetin against
  H2O2-induced cell damage.
- H2O2 is one of the major ROS related to oxidative stress.
- It easily penetrates cells and proceeds to react with intracellular ions such as
  iron and copper, thereby generating highly reactive hydroxyl radical that subsequently
  attack cellular components including lipids, proteins, and DNA to cause various
  types of oxidative damage (Denisova et al.
- 2001; Mary et al.
- 2012).
- H2O2-induced membrane lipid peroxidation is one of the most important lesions responsible
  for the loss of cell viability.
- There are many reports that flavonoids have cytoprotective effects by antioxidant
  effect against oxidative stress.
- Flavonoids morin (Zhang et al.
- 2011a), myricetin (Wang et al.
- 2010), and butin (Zhang et al.
- 2011b) showed similar cytoprotective effect against oxidative stress compared to
  fisetin.
- Ahlenstiel et al.
- (2003) demonstrated that cytoprotective effects of fisetin and other flavonoids
  may be due to the integration of flavonoids into membrane lipid bilayers.
- Due to its almost complete three-dimensional planarity, flavonoid can easily interact
  with the ordered structure of lipid bilayers (van Acker et al.
- 1996).
- The hydroxyl group in the B ring in flavones with the 2,3-double bond and 4-keto
  group in C ring allow to exhibiting the cytoprotective activity (Nakayama et al.
- 1993).
- Therefore, this structure-containing fisetin can contribute to the cytoprotective
  activity against oxidative stress.
- The oxidative damage of DNA, which involves base modification and DNA strand breakage,
  may ultimately lead to genetic alterations (Gordon-Thomson et al.
- 2012).
- In addition, oxidative damage to amino acid residues in proteins results in the
  formation of carbonyl derivatives (Hamilton et al.
- 2013).
- In this study, considerable amounts of lipid, DNA, and protein damage were produced
  in V79-4 cells after H2O2 exposure; however, fisetin pre-treatment significantly
  reduced all types of damage and consequently protected against cell death.
- In summary, our data demonstrate that fisetin plays an important role in the protective
  effect against H2O2-induced cell damage via direct effect of ROS scavenging and
  indirect effect of ROS scavenging via enhancing of GSH antioxidant capacity.
