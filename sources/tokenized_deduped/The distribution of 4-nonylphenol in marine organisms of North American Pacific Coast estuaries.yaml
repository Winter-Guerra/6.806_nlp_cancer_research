- One of the chemical breakdown products of nonylphenol ethoxylates, 4-nonylphenol
  (4-NP), accumulates in organisms and is of concern as an environmental pollutant
  due to its endocrine disrupting effects.
- We measured 4-NP levels in the seawater, sediment, and twelve organisms within the
  California estuary, Morro Bay, and examined biomagnification of 4-NP using stable
  isotope abundances (_Î´_15N and _Î´_13C) to quantify trophic position.
- 4-NP concentrations in organisms from Morro Bay included 25000 ± 8600 ng g−1 lw
  in liver of California sea lion, 14000 ± 5600 ng g−1 lw in liver of harbor porpoise,
  138000 ± 55000 ng g−1 lw in liver of sea otters, 15700 ± 3600 ng g−1 lw in liver
  of seabirds, 36100 ± 6100 ng g−1 lw in arrow goby fish, 62800 ± 28400 ng g−1 lw
  in oysters, and 12700 ± 1300 ng g−1 lw in mussels.
- '4-NP levels generally showed a pattern of trophic dilution among organisms in Morro
  Bay, with exceptions of biomagnification observed between three trophic links: mussel
  to sea otter (BMF 10.9), oyster to sea otter (BMF 2.2), and arrow goby to staghorn
  sculpin (BMF 2.7).'
- 'Our examination of other west coast estuaries of USA and Canada revealed that mean
  4-NP concentrations in gobies and mussels from Morro Bay were significantly higher
  than those from a more urbanized estuary, San Francisco Bay (goby: 11100 ± 3800
  ng g−1 lw) and from a remote estuary, Bamfield Inlet, Canada (goby: 9000 ± 900 ng
  g−1 lw, mussel: 6100 ± 700 ng g−1 lw).'
- Relative to other estuaries worldwide, 4-NP levels in seawater (0.42 ± 0.16 Î¼g
  L−1) and sediment (53 ± 14 ng g−1 dw) of Morro Bay are low, but gobies and oysters
  have higher 4-NP levels than comparable fauna.
