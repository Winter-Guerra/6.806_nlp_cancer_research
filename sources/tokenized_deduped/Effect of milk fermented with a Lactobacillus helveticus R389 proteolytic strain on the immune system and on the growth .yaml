- Previous studies on a murine model have demonstrated that the administration of
  _Lactobacillus helveticus_ and _Lactobacillus casei_ inhibits the development of
  fibrosarcoma and colon carcinoma, respectively.
- The aim of this work was to study the beneficial effects of the consumption of milk
  fermented by _L.
- helveticus_ on a murine model for mammary carcinoma.
- Female BALB/c mice were challenged by a single subcutaneous injection of tumoral
  cells (American Type Culture Collection 4T1) in the left mammary gland.
- Prior to tumour injection, mice were fed for two, five or seven consecutive days
  with fermented milk.
- 'The following factors were monitored for 2 months: rate of tumour development,
  histological studies, apoptosis, phagocytic index, peritoneal macrophages, determination
  of β-glucuronidase enzyme in peritoneal macrophages, determination of γ-interferon
  (INFγ) and tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in blood serum, determination of CD4+,
  CD8+, interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-10, TNF-α and INFγ by immunoperoxidase, and measurement
  of β-glucuronidase activity in intestinal fluid.'
- The administration of _L.
- helveticus_ delayed the development of the tumour in all cases, a 2- or 7-day feeding
  period being most effective.
- This work demonstrates that milk fermented with _L.
- helveticus_ decreases the growth rate of mammary tumours.
- The effect was mediated by increased apoptosis and decreased production of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines, in particular IL-6, implicated in oestrogen synthesis.
