- A high intake of brassica vegetables may be associated with a decreased chronic
  disease risk.
- Health promoting effects of Brassicaceae have been partly attributed to glucosinolates
  and in particular to their hydrolyzation products including isothiocyanates.
- _In vitro_ and _in vivo_ studies suggest a chemopreventive activity of isothiocyanates
  through the redox-sensitive transcription factor Nrf2.
- Furthermore, studies in cultured cells, in laboratory rodents, and also in humans
  support an anti-inflammatory effect of brassica-derived phytochemicals.
- However, the underlying mechanisms of how these compounds mediate their health promoting
  effects are yet not fully understood.
- Recent findings suggest that brassica-derived compounds are regulators of epigenetic
  mechanisms.
- It has been shown that isothiocyanates may inhibit histone deacetylase transferases
  and DNA-methyltransferases in cultured cells.
- Only a few papers have dealt with the effect of brassica-derived compounds on epigenetic
  mechanisms in laboratory animals, whereas data in humans are currently lacking.
- The present review aims to summarize the current knowledge regarding the biological
  activities of brassica-derived phytochemicals regarding chemopreventive, anti-inflammatory,
  and epigenetic pathways.
- Epidemiological studies link a high intake of brassica vegetables with a lower incidence
  for different kinds of cancers [1-3].
- Health promoting effects of brassica vegetables have been attributed to glucosinolates,
  sulfur containing compounds almost exclusively present in plants of the family Brassicaceae.
- However, these chemopreventive effects are not mediated by glucosinolates _per se_
  but mainly through isothiocyanates, one of the major hydrolysis products resulting
  from myrosinase cleavage [4-9].
- Myrosinase is a thioglucohydrolase located apart from glucosinolates in so-called
  myrosin cells.
- Upon plant cell disruption enzyme and glucosinolate get in contact and hydrolization
  is initiated.
- Based on reaction conditions (e.g., pH, temperature) either isothiocyanates, thiocyanates,
  or nitriles are formed (Figure 1) [10, 11].
- 'Figure 1: Myrosinase-mediated hydrolysis of glucosinolates with main break-down
  products (modified according to [114]).'
- Several _in vitro _and _in vivo_ studies suggest that brassica derived phytochemicals
  may counteract inflammatory pathways and exhibit chemopreventive activity.
- Furthermore, impact of glucosinolates and/or their corresponding hydrolyzation products
  on epigenetic mechanisms including DNA-methylation, histone modification, and microRNAs
  has been recently described and is in the focus of the present paper.
- Chemical structures of selected brassica-derived phytochemicals are presented in
  Figure 2.
- 'Figure 2: Chemical structures of selected aliphatic and aromatic brassica-derived
  phytochemicals.'
- Several studies suggest anti-inflammatory properties of brassica-derived phytochemicals
  [12].
- Besides others, these beneficial effects may be mediated through an induction of
  antioxidant and phase 1/2 genes and the inhibition of proinflammatory signaling
  pathways via regulation of various transcription factors which may be further controlled
  by epigenetic modifications and miRNAs [11, 13-15].
- Additionally, it has been shown that brassica derived phytochemicals exhibit anti-infective
  and antiviral activity (e.g.
- inhibiting _Helicobacter pylori_) [16-18].
- In this context the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF_κ_B) is a central
  player in inflammatory processes.
- In general, NF_κ_B resides inactively in the cytosol as a heterodimer consisting
  of two subunits, for example, p50 and p65, bound to its inhibitory protein I_κ_B_α_
  [19].
- NF_κ_B can be activated by a wide variety of proinflammatory stimuli including cytokines
  and reactive oxygen species resulting in the activation of upstream kinases, phosphorylation,
  ubiquitination, and consequently the degradation of I_κ_B_α_ [20].
- Once p50 and p65 have been released, they translocate to the nucleus and bind to
  the _κ_B site located in the promoter regions of the DNA of target genes thereby
  driving gene expression [21, 22].
- NF_κ_B target genes include, for example, cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), inducible nitric
  oxide synthase (iNOS) (inflammatory function), Bcl-Xl, Bcl-2, Bcl-3 (anti-apoptotic
  function), MYC (cell division), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP), and vascular endothelial
  growth factor (VEGF) (angiogenesis) [23-25].
- Due to NF_κ_Bs central role in inflammation the transcription factor seems to be
  an attractive target to treat inflammation related diseases.
- A variety of naturally occurring NF_κ_B inhibitors have been described including
  brassica derived phytochemicals like sulforaphane (SFN), phenethyl-isothiocyanate
  (PEITC), 8-methylsulphinyloctyl isothiocyanate (MSO), and indole-3-carbinol (I3C).
- They downregulate lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced activation of NF_κ_B and suppress
  COX-2, iNOS, and prostaglandin (PG) expression in cultured mouse macrophages, possibly
  via inactivating NF_κ_B [26-31].
- Furthermore, 3,3′-diindolylmethane (DIM) significantly reduced PGE(2), NO, proinflammatory
  cytokines, and the number of colon tumors in BALB/c mice suffering from colitis
  associated colon cancer [32].
- In C57BL/6 mice we observed that a 7-day pretreatment with SFN resulted in less
  severe symptoms of DSS-induced colitis as compared to PBS-pretreated controls [33].
- Interestingly, Prawan et al.
- (2009) have observed that synthetic ITCs show an even stronger anti-inflammatory
  activity than that of their natural counterparts [30].
- However, the underlying mechanisms of how brassica derived phytochemicals modulate
  the NF_κ_B pathway are only partly understood.
- Most studies indicate that ITCs inhibit DNA binding of NF_κ_B, suppress its translocation,
  or stabilize I_κ_B_α_ through a decreased phosphorylation of _Ι__κ_B kinase complexes
  (IKKs) [26, 30, 34-36].
- This in turn suggests that ITCs target upstream factors like MAPK pathways (e.g.,
  ERK, JNK, or p38) resulting in NF_κ_B inhibition [30].
- A study conducted by Yang and coworkers (2010) confirmed this hypothesis by demonstrating
  that PEITC inhibits ERK1/2, MAPK kinase 7 (MAPKK7), and MAPK kinase kinase 3 (MAPKK3)
  [37].
- ITCs may also act anti-inflammatorily through lowering ROS-induced NF_κ_B activity
  [34].
- Heiss and coworkers observed that SFN impairs DNA-binding of NF_κ_B which was not
  accompanied by I_κ_B degradation and nuclear translocation of NF__κ__B [26].
- It is supposed that SFN interacts with thiol groups, forms dithiocarbamates, and
  binds directly to redox-regulated cystein residues (Cys62 and Cys38) of the p50
  and p65 subunits which prevent DNA binding [38].
- A modification of these cystein residues may provide an alternative strategy for
  phytochemical mediated chemoprevention [20].
- Brassica derived phytochemicals may also mediate anti-inflammatory effects through
  an interaction with reduced redox regulators like glutathione, thioredoxin, or redox
  factor 1 (ref-1), leading to changes of the reducing milieu required for correct
  DNA binding [39].
- Nrf2 is a transcription factor playing a crucial role in regulating inflammation
  and chemoprevention.
- Under basal conditions Nrf2 is bound to its cytosolic inhibitor, the Kelch like
  ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) [40].
- In the presence of activating agents including isothiocyanates and other electrophiles
  Nrf2 may be activated through two distinct cellular signaling pathways resulting
  in the liberation of Nrf2 from its inhibitor Keap1.
- Nrf2 can either be phosphorylated through an activation of upstream protein kinases
  which causes the destruction of the Nrf2-Keap1 complex or in the presence of pro-oxidants
  the cysteine thiols of Keap1 may be modified which promotes dissociation of Nrf2
  from Keap1.
- Liberated Nrf2 translocates to the nucleus where it binds together with several
  cofactors including small Maf proteins (MafF, MafG, and MafK), c-Jun, and cAMP response
  element-binding (CREB) protein (CBP) to the antioxidant response elements (AREs)
  in the promoter regions of genes encoding antioxidant and detoxifying phase II enzymes
  like NADPH quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), hemeoxygenase-1 (HO-1), superoxide dismutase
  (SOD), glutamyl cysteine ligase (GCL), and GST [20, 41].
- Khor et al.
- (2006) have reported that Nrf2-deficient mice suffer under a more severe dextran-sulfate-sodium-
  (DSS-)induced colitis than Nrf2+ mice which was accompanied by a decreased expression
  of antioxidant and phase II enzymes and an increased level of proinflammatory mediators
  like COX-2, iNOS, interleukin 1_β_ (IL-1_β_), and tumor necrosis factor _α_ (TNF_α_)
  [42].
- Different phytochemicals can lead to nuclear accumulation of Nrf2 [43, 44].
- In particular, the effect of SFN on Nrf2 pathways has been intensively investigated,
  showing that SFN _in vitro _and in animal studies successfully activates phase 2
  and antioxidant enzymes via induction of Nrf2 [45-48].
- Also other ITCs such as allyl-isothiocyanate (AITC), butyl-isothiocyanate (BITC),
  and PEITC have been shown to exhibit similar Nrf2 inducing activity _in vitro _[48,
  49].
- PEITC has been proven to be an even stronger inducer of Nrf2-ARE mediated signaling
  pathways than SFN [50].
- There is evidence that overexpression of Nrf2 can modulate NF_κ_B expression, since
  NF_κ_B competes with Nrf2 for binding to the transcriptional coactivator CREB-binding
  protein [51, 52].
- Accordingly, Surh and Na described a cross-talk between NF_κ_B and Nrf2 signaling
  supported by the fact that most of the phytochemicals exhibit both, anti-inflammatory
  and anti-oxidant properties [20].
- Epigenetics describe a heritable change in gene expression that is not mediated
  through a change of DNA-sequence [53].
- Epigenetic changes comprise DNA-methylation, histone modifications, and microRNA
  expressions [53-55].
- Several studies suggest that brassica derived phytochemicals affect epigenetic mechanisms.
- Epigenetic aberrations take place in the early stages of carcinogenesis and partly
  represent an initiating process of cancer development.
- Phytochemicals may intervene in this process and incarnate potential targets for
  cancer prevention [56].
- Posttranslational modifications at the N-terminal tail of histones are one epigenetic
  mechanism that plays a role in gene regulation and carcinogenesis [56, 57].
- Histones can be post-translationally modified by acetylation, deacetylation, phosphorylation,
  ubiquitinylation, sumoylation, and ADP ribosylation [58, 59].
- Biotinylation has also been suggested to mediate histone modification.
- However, recent studies conducted by Li and coworkers as well as by Xue and colleagues
  discovered that it is not a biotinylation _per se_ but an assembly of different
  proteins including biotin ligase and holocarboxylase synthetase interceding histone
  modification [60, 61].
- Histone acetylation and deacetylation are the most analysed modifications mediated
  through a coaction of histone acetyl transferases (HAT) and histone deacetylases
  (HDAC) [56] resulting in gene activation and inhibition of gene activity, respectively
  [57, 62].
- HATs transfer acetyl groups from acetyl-CoA onto lysine residues at the histone
  [63] while HDACs detach histone acetyl group transferring them onto CoA [56].
- Chromatin acetylation by HATs opens the chromatin structure providing a possibility
  for transcription factors to approach the DNA which may lead to gene activation
  [57].
- HATs are divided into four families on the basis of their structure homologues.
- At present, however, there is no literature data available presenting effects of
  brassica derived phytochemicals on HAT activity.
- Several studies suggest an effect of these phytochemicals on HDACs.
- HDACs are also divided into four groups according to their structure homology to
  yeast deacetylases [64, 65].
- Both, _in vitro _and _in vivo _studies present ITCs as potent HDAC inhibitors [66].
- Recent investigations by Rajendran and coworkers [67, 68] revealed a dose-dependent
  inhibition of HDAC activity and an increase of HDAC protein turnover following ITC
  incubation of HCT116 colon cancer cells that was proportionally dependent on their
  alkyl chain length.
- Besides colon cancer cells, HDAC inhibitory effects of SFN have been shown in various
  prostate epithelial cells--normal prostate epithelial cells (PrEC), benign hyperplasia
  (BPH1), and cancerous (LnCaP, PC-3) prostate epithelial cells [69, 70] as well as
  in different breast cancer cells [71].
- The HDAC inhibitory effect of SFN has also been confirmed in an _in vivo_ model
  [72, 73].
- Also other ITCs, including PEITC [74], the synthetic phenylhexyl-ITC (PHI) [75-77]
  and benzyl-ITC (BITC) [78], inhibit HDAC activity in different cell lines.
- The indole DIM, a known brassica derived plant bioactive, has been reported to decrease
  HDAC activity in the prostate cancer cell lines PC-3 and LnCaP.
- Interestingly, the monomer of the compound I3C had only a weak effect on LnCaP cells,
  which are androgen sensitive, and non on PC-3 cells being androgen-insensitive [79].
- In a clinical trial it turned out that SFN-rich broccoli sprouts consumed by healthy
  human subjects exhibit HDAC inhibitory effects [73, 80].
- DNA methylation is regulated by various DNA-methyltransferases (DNMT 1, 3a, 3b)
  that transfer methyl groups from the methyl precursor S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM)
  to the C5-position of certain cytosines and influence gene transcription [81, 82].
- Gene promoter regions rich in CpG sequences--so called CpG islands--are generally
  unmethylated in normal cells [56], whereas transformed cells often show hypermethylated
  promoters and/or genome wide hypomethylation [57].
- Predicted CpG islands in the promoters of Nrf2 and Keap1 are shown in Figure 3.
- Besides carcinogenesis changes in DNA methylation patterns are also associated with
  ageing and the development of chronic degenerative diseases [56, 83].
- Currently only little information regarding DNMT inhibition by ITCs is available
  in the literature.
- The main investigated ITC regarding its DNMT inhibiting activity is SFN.
- Studies conducted by Meeran and colleagues [84] in the human breast cancer cell
  lines, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231, revealed an inhibiting effect of SFN on DNMT1 and DNMT3a.
- SFN has been reported to inhibit DNMT-expression in the human colorectal cancer
  cell line CaCo-2 [85], in LnCaP human prostate cancer cells [86], and in porcine
  satellite cells [87].
- Furthermore, effects of the naturally occuring ITC iberin [85] and the synthetic
  ITC PHI on DNMT inhibition in colorectal cancer cells and in the acute lymphoid
  leukemia cell line Molt-4 [88] have been described.
- However, _in vivo_ data for DNMT inhibition by brassica derived phytochemicals is
  lacking and needs further investigation.
- 'Figure 3: CpG islands in the promoter of Nrf2 (a) and Keap1 (b) identified by using
  the database _dbcat_ (http://dbcat.cgm.ntu.edu.tw/).'
- MicroRNAs (miRNA) represent a class of evolutionary conserved small noncoding RNAs
  with a length of ~22 nucleotides that control gene expression at the posttranscriptional
  level [89-91].
- MicroRNAs bind to the 3′ untranslated region (3′UTR) of target mRNAs and lead, depending
  on the base pair complementarity between microRNA and target mRNA, to a decreased
  translation and mRNA degradation, respectively [92, 93].
- MicroRNAs are involved in a number of several cellular processes in the organism
  including development, cell-proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis [91, 94,
  95].
- There are some data pointing to the notion that Brassica derived phytochemicals
  modulate miRNA expression suggesting that this is one mechanism of how these compounds
  may mediate health promoting activity.
- Slaby and coworkers [96] treated the colonic epithelial cell lines NCM460 and NCM356
  with the isothiocyanates iberin and SFN which resulted in the regulation of three
  common microRNAs--miR-155, miR-23b, and miR-27b.
- Interestingly, it has been found that PEITC affects miR-141 in LnCaP cells, a microRNA
  which has been closely linked to the development of prostate cancer [97].
- Also Basu and colleagues [98] observed microRNA-modulating effects according to
  isothiocyanate treatment of mice suffering from pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia.
- The authors identified an inhibition of miR-221 and miR-375 following benzyl-ITC
  treatment changing hyperproliferative into hypoproliferative pancreatic cancer cells.
- Our own studies revealed an inhibitory effect of allyl-isothiocyanate (AITC) and
  SFN on the proinflammatory and oncogenic miR-155 in RAW264.7 murine macrophages
  [99].
- In the lungs of mice exposed to environmental cigarette smoke microRNA expression
  has been altered which could be counteracted by PEITC treatment.
- However, some side effects of PEITC, including dysregulation of hepatic microRNAs,
  have been observed which should be investigated in more detail [100, 101].
- Furthermore, the brassica derived phytochemical I3C has been shown to reverse vinyl-carbamate
  induced de-regulation of microRNAs and the I3C dimer DIM increased miR-146a expression
  which in turn resulted in a decrease of cell invasion [102, 103].
- To predict microRNA binding sites in the 3′UTR of different genes internet based
  prediction tools, including http://www.microrna.org/microrna/home.do, are available.
- According to http://www.microrna.org/microrna/home.do more than 40 conserved microRNAs
  may bind to Nrf2 (Figure 4(a)).
- However, only a small number of microRNAs, including miR-28, miR-93, miR-144, miR-153,
  miR-27a, miR-132, and miR142-5p, have been confirmed experimentally to directly
  bind to the 3′UTR of Nrf2 and consequently downregulate gene expression [104-108].
- Most of the microRNAs discussed in the literature to impact Nrf2 are affecting the
  expression of the transcription factor indirectly.
- Eades and coworkers [109] observed that miR-200a degrades Keap1 mRNA which in turn
  causes an increase of Nrf2 levels in breast cancer cells.
- A recent study conducted by Petrelli and colleagues [110] confirmed the effect of
  miR-200a in preneoplastic lesions, where miR-200a also lowered Keap1 expression
  resulting in an Nrf2 increase.
- Also miR-141 binds to Keap1 which results in increased Nrf2 levels [111].
- http://www.microrna.org/microrna/home.do suggests five conserved microRNAs to bind
  to Keap1 from which already two have been confirmed to effectively target the 3′UTR
  of Keap1 (Figure 4(b)).
- 'Figure 4: Predicted binding sites of conserved microRNAs of Nrf2 (a) and Keap1
  (b) as identified by http://www.microrna.org/microrna/home.do.'
- The expression of Nrf2 regulating microRNAs is modulated by several environmental
  insults including diesel exhaust [112] and the mycotoxin ochratoxin A [108].
- Interestingly, a study conducted by Singh and coworkers suggests that Nrf2 itself
  targets microRNAs.
- The authors observed an increase of miR-1 and miR-206 levels while Nrf2 is simultaneously
  upregulated [113].
- Figure 5 gives an overview of how microRNAs are involved in Nrf2/Keap1 signaling.
- Table 1 lists confirmed microRNAs that target the promoter region of Nrf2 and Keap1.
- 'Table 1: MicroRNAs inhibiting transcription factor Nrf2 and its inhibitor protein
  Keap1.'
- ITCs are one of the major degradation products of glucosinolates derived from brassica
  vegetables and are partly held to be responsible for the health promoting effects
  observed in populations with a high consumption of Brassicaceae.
- The health promoting effects of a diet rich in Brassica vegetables have been known
  for several decades and seem to be a promising starting point for, for example,
  the development of chemopreventive and anti-inflammatory functional foods, dietary
  supplements, and drugs.
- Figure 6 gives an overview of how brassica-derived phytochemicals may mediate their
  health-promoting activity.
- An increasing number of studies deal with ITC effects on the chemopreventive transcription
  factor Nrf2 and its corresponding target genes including antioxidant and phase 2
  enzymes.
- In addition to studies in cultured cells beneficial effects of ITC have also been
  confirmed _in vivo_ in laboratory rodents and humans.
- Also the anti-inflammatory effects of ITCs are well documented in both cell culture
  and _in vivo_ studies.
- The applied concentrations of brassica derived phytochemicals range between 0.25
  and 100 _μ_mol/L in _in vitro _studies and up to 90 mg/kg BW in mouse studies.
- However, with regard to ITC effects on epigenetic mechanisms including histone modifications,
  DNA methylation, and microRNAs only a limited number of studies are currently available.
- In this context several studies have been performed in cultured cells and have revealed
  an increase in epigenetic targets connected with an inhibition of HDAC and DNMT
  as well as on microRNA expression.
- However, data concerning the modulation of epigenetic targets by ITCs especially
  in humans are, by and large, lacking even though epigenetic targets seem to play
  an essential role in the development of different kinds of cancer and may depict
  a promising target to prevent and/or treat chronic diseases.
