- Pomegranate fruit and pomegranate juices have recently received great attention
  for their health benefits, mainly due to their high polyphenols content and the
  related antioxidant capacity.
- Nevertheless, the pomegranate processing and its effects on juice composition has
  been only little investigated.
- In this paper two important steps of pomegranate juice production, the separation
  of arils from peels (cleaning) and the enzymatic clarification of the juice, were
  considered, and the characterization (pH, acidity, total soluble solids, protein,
  polyphenols and antioxidant activity) of pomegranate juices obtained in different
  cleaning and clarification conditions was reported.
- Results showed that the cleaning procedures largely affect the juice composition
  and its organoleptic properties, and a significant positive correlation was found
  among peels content before pressing, total polyphenols, antioxidant capacity and
  perceived bitterness of the juice.
- Juice with endocarp and mesocarp content of 2 and 10 g/100 g and only mesocarp of
  10 g/100 g showed a TEAC value of 14.1 and 13.1 mmol/L, respectively, significantly
  higher compared to juice with no peels (9.5 mmol/L).
- Treatment with pectolytic enzymes resulted in a better extraction of all the fruit
  components, as polyphenols (about 2-fold) and a decrease of turbidity (âˆ’40%).
