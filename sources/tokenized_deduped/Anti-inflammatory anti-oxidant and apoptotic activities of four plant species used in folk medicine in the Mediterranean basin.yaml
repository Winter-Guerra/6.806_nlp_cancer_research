- The aim of this research was to study the potential anti-inflammatory activity of
  myrtle (Myrtus communis), sarsaparilla (Smilax aspera), Arabian or French lavender
  (Lavandula stoechas), and calamint (Calamintha nepeta) along with their apoptotic
  effects on the pro-inflammatory cells, and the correlation of these effects with
  the plants' potential anti-oxidant activity.
- Myrtle extract exhibited the highest inhibitory activity in the paw oedema induced
  by carrageenan (60% at 3 h), whereas calamint, lavender, and sarsaparilla produced
  inhibitions of 49%, 38%, and 47%, respectively.
- None of them had an effect on the TPA-induced ear oedema.
- Moreover, all the extracts except sarsaparilla showed different degrees of anti-oxidant
  activity.
- Lavender and myrtle at 200 Î¼g/mL decreased cell viability by 63% and 59%, respectively,
  after 3 h of incubation.
- Neutrophil elimination through apoptosis could be implicated in the resolution of
  acute inflammation in the case of lavender, whereas the reduction of reactive oxygen
  species produced by neutrophils, such as the superoxide anion and the hydroxyl radical,
  could be implicated in the overall reduction of inflammation.
- These results may support the traditional use of these plants.
