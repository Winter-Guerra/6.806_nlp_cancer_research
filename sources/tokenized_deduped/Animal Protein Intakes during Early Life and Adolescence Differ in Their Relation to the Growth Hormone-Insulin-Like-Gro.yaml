- Recent studies provide evidence that insulin-like-growth-factor I (IGF-I) and its
  binding proteins (IGFBP) IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-3 are related to the risk of several
  common cancers.
- It remains to be clarified whether their concentrations can be programmed by protein
  intake from different sources during growth.
- This study addressed the hypothesis that animal protein intakes during infancy,
  mid-childhood, and adolescence differ in their relevance for the growth-hormone
  (GH)-IGF-I axis in young adulthood.
- 'Data from the Dortmund Nutritional and Anthropometric Longitudinally Designed Study
  participants with at least 2 plausible 3-d weighed dietary records during adolescence
  (age: girls, 9-14 y; boys, 10-15 y; n = 213), around the adiposity rebound (age
  4-6 y; n = 179) or early life (age 0.5-2 y; n = 130), and one blood sample in young
  adulthood were included in the study.'
- Mean serum concentrations of IGF-I, IGFBP-1, IGFBP-2, and IGFBP-3 were compared
  between tertiles of habitual animal protein intake using multivariable regression
  analysis.
- Habitually higher animal protein intakes in females during puberty were related
  to higher IGF-I (P-trend = 0.005) and IGFBP-3 (P-trend = 0.01) and lower IGFBP-2
  (P-trend = 0.04), but not to IGFBP-1 in young adulthood.
- In turn, IGF-I concentrations in young adulthood were inversely related to animal
  protein intakes in early life among males only (P-trend = 0.03), but not to animal
  protein intake around adiposity rebound (P-trend &gt; 0.5).
- Our data suggest that, among females, a habitually higher animal protein intake
  during puberty may precipitate an upregulation of the GH-IGF-I axis, which is still
  discernible in young adulthood.
- By contrast, among males, higher animal protein intakes in early life may exert
  a long-term programming of the GH-IGF-I axis.
