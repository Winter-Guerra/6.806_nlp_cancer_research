---
- Lignans are a group of estrogenic compounds present in plants.
- Several epidemiological studies proposed that lignans may protect against breast
  cancer by exerting anticarcinogenic activity.
- Levels of enterolactone were determined in serum samples of 1,250 cases and 2,164
  controls from a large population-based case-control study.
- We assessed the association between serum enterolactone and postmenopausal breast
  cancer risk using conditional logistic regression accounting for potential risk
  and confounding factors.
- Fractional polynomials were used to determine the function that best fitted the
  data.
- Moreover, we assessed heterogeneity by estrogen/progesterone/herceptin (ER/PR/HER2)
  status of the tumor.
- Additionally, a meta-analysis with seven further studies addressing enterolactone
  concentrations and breast cancer risk was performed.
- 'Postmenopausal breast cancer risk decreased with increasing serum enterolactone
  levels [highest compared to lowest quintile: [odds ratio = 0.65; 95% confidence
  interval (CI) 0.52-0.83, _p_trend = &lt;0.0001].'
- A significant inverse association for ER+/PR+ as well as ER−/PR− tumors was observed,
  with a significantly stronger association for ER−/PR− tumors (_p_heterogeneity =
  0.03).
- The association for ER−/PR− tumors did not differ by expression of HER2 (_p_heterogeneity
  = 0.3).
- 'The meta-analysis yielded a significant reduced pooled risk estimate of: 0.66;
  95% CI: 0.55-0.77) comparing the highest to the lowest quantiles of enterolactone
  levels.'
- We found strong evidence for a significant inverse association between serum enterolactone
  and postmenopausal breast cancer risk, which was stronger for ER−PR− than for ER+PR+
  tumors but not differential by further expression of HER2.
- The overall evidence together with other studies supports an inverse association
  between higher serum enterolactone levels and postmenopausal breast cancer risk.
- Phytoestrogens are a group of biologically active compounds that have been shown
  to protect against hormone-dependent cancers, in particular, breast cancer.1-4 Their
  protective inverse association with breast cancer may be due to either estrogenic
  or antiestrogenic properties.5-8 Because of their chemical structure, phytoestrogens
  can compete with endogenous estrogen for binding to the estrogen receptor (ER) of
  the tumor, thereby plausibly reducing the hormonal effect of the endogenous estrogens.9
  In addition to this, phytoestrogens also have antioxidative and antiproliferative
  properties and thereby may also reduce cancer risk.10 The two main groups of phytoestrogens
  are the isoflavones and the lignans.
- Isoflavones, in particular, genistein, are mostly found in soy products.
- 'Only a few nonsoy plants contain isoflavones (_e.g_., legumes, grapefruit and raisins);
  but, at lower concentration, isoflavones do not importantly contribute to phytoestrogen
  intake in Western diets.11, 12 Plant lignans are widely present in whole grain,
  berries, vegetables, fruits, flaxseeds and other types of seeds and are the main
  source of phytoestrogens in Western populations.13 Plant lignans (lariciresinol,
  pinoresinol, secoisolariciresinol and matairesinol) are metabolized into mammalian
  lignans (enterolignans: enterolactone, enterodiol) in the human gut.'
- Serum or urinary levels of enterolignans can serve as an alternative indicator of
  individual dietary lignan intake.
- The advantage of these biomarkers is that they do not rely on self-reported dietary
  intake or on dietary databases for lignan quantification.
- 'Several studies in Western populations have investigated the association of either
  dietary lignan intake or lignan biomarkers with pre- or postmenopausal breast cancer
  risk, with inconsistent results.14-21 Two recently published meta-analyses (including
  our own) showed that high serum or urinary enterolactone levels were associated
  with a nonsignificant reduced postmenopausal breast cancer risk, whereas high consumption
  of dietary lignans was associated with a significant reduced postmenopausal breast
  cancer risk.22, 23


  The objective of our study was to examine the association of the major serum enterolignan
  (enterolactone) with the risk of postmenopausal breast cancer in a large German
  study population with Western dietary habits.'
- Additionally, we investigated whether this association differs by ER, progesterone
  receptor (PR) or herceptin receptor (HER2) status of the tumor.
- 'BMI: body mass index; CI: confidence interval; ER: estrogen receptor; FFQ: Food
  Frequency Questionnaire; HER2: herceptin receptor; HRT: hormone replacement therapy;
  OR: odds ratio; PR: progesterone receptor; TR-FIA: time-resolved fluoroimmunoassays;
  RE: risk estimates






  A population-based case-control study Mammary carcinoma Risk factor Investigation
  was carried out in two study regions in Germany (Hamburg and Rhine-Neckar-Karlsruhe).'
- German-speaking women aged 50-74 years, diagnosed with histologically confirmed
  primary invasive or _in situ_ breast cancer between January 1, 2001 and September
  30, 2005 in Hamburg and between August 1, 2002 and July 31, 2005 in the Rhine-Neckar-Karlsruhe
  region, were identified through participating clinics and the Hamburg Cancer Registry.
- For each patient, two controls matched for birth year and study center were randomly
  selected using resident registries.
- In total, 3,464 postmenopausal cases and 6,657 postmenopausal controls were participated
  in this study.
- Women were defined as postmenopausal if they reported their last natural menstrual
  bleeding at least 12 months before the reference date, or a bilateral oophorectomy,
  or cessation of menses due to treatment of disease other than breast cancer by either
  radiation or chemotherapy.
- Those above age 55 years whose menopausal status was unclear because of hysterectomy
  or hormone use were also considered postmenopausal but assigned an unknown age at
  menopause.
- More detailed information on the study population can be found elsewhere.24 Face-to-face
  interviews were carried out by trained interviewers using a standardized questionnaire
  to collect information on sociodemographic characteristics as well as putative risk
  factors for breast cancer, including reproductive history, use of hormone replacement
  therapy (HRT), family history of breast cancer, physical activity, smoking and alcohol
  consumption.
- Furthermore, a self-administered Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) was applied
  to collect information on nutritional habits in the year before diagnosis of breast
  cancer or the year before FFQ completion for controls.
- All participants gave written confirmed consent.
- The study was approved by the ethics committees of both the University of Heidelberg
  and the University of Hamburg and conducted in agreement with the Helsinki declaration.
- Nonfasting serum samples were obtained from participants in the Rhine-Neckar-Karlsruhe
  region and stored at −80°C.
- Hemolytic samples were excluded from the measurements (143 cases and 236 controls),
  resulting in 1,250 cases (including 78 _in situ_ cancers) and 2,164 controls.
- For cases, median time between diagnosis and blood collection was about 3 months.
- The range for blood collection was 0-37 months after diagnosis; nevertheless, for
  98.6% of participants, blood collection was within 1 year of diagnosis.
- Enterolactone was measured by time-resolved fluoroimmunoassays (TR-FIA) according
  to the methods developed and validated by Adlercreutz _et al_.
- and Wang _et al_.25, 26 The measurements were conducted using the enterolactone
  kit as described by the manufacturer _Labmaster_ Laboratory in Turku Finland.
- In brief, 150 μl of serum was incubated overnight at 37°C with 150 μl of 100 mM
  acetate buffer (pH 5.0, containing 0.2 U/ml of β-glucuronidase and 2 U/ml of sulfatase),
  mixed with 150 μl aliquot of serum and incubated overnight at 37°C.
- Diethyl-ether was used to extract unconjugated phytoestrogen after hydrolysis.
- Two diethyl-ether phases were combined and evaporated to dryness using a water bath.
- Finally, the dried residues were dissolved in assay buffer and measured using (europium-labeled)
  TR-FIA.
- All batches were mixed and measured blinded with respect to case-control status
  and included two quality controls at varying positions on the assay plate.
- Single measurements were performed for all samples.
- For the quality controls for enterolactone in 33.1 nmol sample volume, the mean
  intra- and interassay coefficient of variation were 10.8 and 19.2%, respectively.
- Clinical and pathologic tumor characteristics were abstracted from hospital records
  and pathology reports.
- Hormone receptor status was ascertained using immunohistochemical testing, with
  immunoreactive scoring according to Remmele and Stegner.27 The Remmele scoring system
  combines both the intensity of staining and the percentage of positive cells.
- The staining intensity is categorized into four groups (0 = no staining (negative),
  1 = weak staining, 2 = moderate staining and 3 = strong staining).
- The percentage of positive cells was categorized into five groups (0% = 0, &lt;10%
  = 1, 10-50% = 2, 51-80% = 3 and &gt;80% = 4).
- A cut-off point of 0-2 was interpreted as negative tumors, and ≥3 was interpreted
  as positive tumors.
- HER2 was assessed using standardized immunohistochemical testing (graded from 0
  to 3, 0-1 means that a normal amount of the HER2 protein is present and the result
  is HER2-negative, 2 means that a moderate amount of the HER2 protein is present,
  3 means that there is a higher than normal level of HER2 protein and the result
  is HER2-positive), followed by a fluorescent _in situ_ hybridization test (FISH)
  in the case of weak positive reaction.
- 'The scoring is either FISH-negative when normal levels of the gene are present
  or FISH-positive when excessive amounts of the gene are present.27, 28




  The association between serum enterolactone and risk of postmenopausal breast cancer
  was assessed using conditional logistic regression.'
- Odds ratios (ORs) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were
  calculated using the PROC LOGISTIC procedure of the SAS statistical software package,
  version 9.2 (SAS institute, Cary, NC).
- Fractional polynomials were used to determine the function that best fitted the
  data.29 The continuous variable for enterolactone concentration was entered into
  the multivariate logistic regression models _via_ a set of defined transformations
  [_x_−2, _x_−1, _x_−0.5, _x_0.5, _x_1, _x_2, _x_3 and log(_x_)], allowing for a maximum
  of two terms in the model.
- Using fractional polynomials, we found that the log-transformed model best fitted
  our data, indicating a nonlinear relationship between serum enterolactone concentrations
  and postmenopausal breast cancer risk (_p_nonlinearity = 0.01; Supporting Information
  Fig.
- 1).
- Based on this, serum enterolactone levels were logarithmically transformed to achieve
  normality.
- The value 0.001 was assigned to phytoestrogen levels that were below detection limit
  (26 cases and 28 controls), and the value 300 nmol/l was assigned to values that
  were above quantification level (4 cases and 11 controls).
- Quintiles were calculated using the distribution of serum concentrations in the
  controls.
- Crude and multivariate analyses were stratified by year of birth.
- For multivariate analyses, participants with missing information on any of the covariates
  were excluded from the analyses (5 cases and 18 controls).
- All multivariate analyses were adjusted for breast cancer risk factors and potential
  confounding factors that changed the risk estimate (RE) by ≥10%.
- 'The adjustment factors were given as follows: menopausal induction (natural with/without
  HRT, induced menopause, hysterectomy, start of HRT and other), body mass index (BMI)
  (&lt;22.5, 22.5-25, 25-30 and ≥30 kg/m2), occupational level (blue collar worker,
  simple employee, medium employee, higher employee and leading position), first-degree
  family history of breast cancer (yes, no and unknown), history of benign breast
  disease (yes and no), number of pregnancies (≥28th week) (0, 1, 2 and ≥3), age at
  menarche (&lt;12, 12-14 and ≥15), breastfeeding history (ever and never), total
  number of mammograms (0, 1-4, 5-9 and ≥10, unknown), smoking habit (never, past
  and current), alcohol consumption (g/day) (0, 0-18.9 and ≥19) and use of phytoestrogen
  supplements (yes or no).'
- Physical activity, fruit, vegetable and fiber intake did not substantially change
  the REs and were therefore excluded from the adjusted model.
- To test for trend, the log-transformed continuous serum concentration of enterolactone
  was used in the logistic regression model.
- The significance level for the trend analyses was 0.05.
- Polytomous logistic regression analysis was used to assess the association of serum
  enterolactone with postmenopausal breast cancer risk by ER and PR status of the
  tumor.
- We further examined the association between serum enterolactone and the risk of
  breast cancer according to the combined ER/PR status of the tumor.
- Moreover, we assessed the association of serum enterolactone by combined ER/PR/HER2
  status.
- Because adjuvant chemotherapy might have an effect on the levels of phytoestrogen
  biomarkers, we performed a sensitivity analysis by dividing our study population
  into two groups; the first group had blood collection before start of chemotherapy
  or did not undergo chemotherapy, and the second group had blood collection after
  start of chemotherapy.
- Additionally, we performed a sensitivity analysis to investigate if the association
  was different according to timing of blood collection before or after median time
  between diagnosis and blood collection (3 months).
- Tests for heterogeneity were performed using the Q statistic with a significance
  level of 0.05.
- Meta-analysis of epidemiologic studies addressing enterolactone concentrations and
  breast cancer risk, including the present study, was carried out using the "meta"
  and "rmeta" packages of the statistical software environment R (version 2.9.2).
- To select epidemiological studies that reported on the association of serum/urinary
  lignans on breast cancer risk, a systematic Medline search was performed for publications
  between 1997 and December 2010.
- We used a combination of key words such as breast, phytoestrogens, lignans, enterolactone,
  serum, plasma, urine and epidemiological studies.
- Moreover, cited references in the retrieved articles were carefully reviewed to
  identify possible additional articles that might have been missed in the initial
  search.
- Suitable publications were assessed by three authors independently (AKZ, KB and
  AV).
- The most fully adjusted REs and CIs for the highest quantile compared to the reference
  quantile (the lowest quantile) from each study were used for the meta-analyses.
- The statistical analyses included a test of heterogeneity to determine whether the
  study results (of groups) were significantly heterogeneous.
- Fixed-effect models were used when heterogeneity was low (_p_ &gt; 0.1).
- Otherwise, random effects models were used.30 The individual study results and combined
  pooled estimates were illustrated in forest plots.
- Analyses were conducted for all women combined (pre and postmenopausal) and for
  postmenopausal women separately.
- Moreover, analyses were stratified by study design for studies on postmenopausal
  breast cancer risk.
- The mean age of the cases and controls was 63 years.
- Cases were more likely than controls to have an earlier age at menarche, a lower
  number of pregnancies, no breast feeding history, a history of benign breast disease,
  a higher number of mammograms, a first degree family history of breast cancer and
  to have never smoked and were less likely to use phytoestrogen supplements (Table
  1).
- There was no difference between cases and controls with respect to menopausal induction,
  BMI, occupational class and alcohol consumption.
- The median serum enterolactone concentration was 19.5 nmol/l in cases and 22.8 nmol/l
  in controls (_p_-value = 0.005).
- 'The crude OR for the highest _versus_ lowest quintile of serum enterolactone in
  relation to postmenopausal breast cancer risk was 0.66 (95% CI: 0.53-0.87; _p_ for
  trend = 0.001; Table 2).'
- 'After adjustment for breast cancer risk factors and potential confounding factors,
  the estimates did not change substantially (OR = 0.65; 95% CI: 0.52-0.83; _p_ for
  trend ≤ 0.0001).'
- Significantly reduced ORs were also observed for the second, third and fourth quintile
  compared to the lowest quintile (Table 2).
- 'Restriction to invasive cases also did not change results substantially (for highest
  quintile OR = 0.61; 95% CI: 0.47-0.78; _p_ for trend ≤ 0.0002).'
- We investigated the association of serum enterolactone with postmenopausal breast
  cancer risk by ER and PR status of the tumor (Table 3).
- Enterolactone levels were associated with both ER+ tumors (highest _vs_.
- 'lowest quintile: OR = 0.73; 95% CI: 0.56-0.95; _p_ for trend = 0.01) and ER-tumors
  (highest _vs_.'
- 'lowest quintile: OR = 0.39; 95% CI: 0.25-0.59; _p_ for trend ≤ 0.0001).'
- However, the association was stronger for ER-tumors (_p_ for heterogeneity = 0.01).
- We also observed a significant inverse association in both PR+ tumors (highest _vs_.
- 'lowest quintile: OR = 0.68; 95% CI: 0.52-0.90; _p_ for trend = 0.001) and PR− tumors
  (highest _vs_.'
- 'lowest quintile: OR = 0.51; 95% CI: 0.33-0.73; _p_ for trend = 0.0004), but without
  significant effect heterogeneity (_p_ for heterogeneity = 0.2).'
- 'Analyses by combined ER/PR status of the tumor yielded the strongest inverse association
  for the ER−/PR− tumors, with an OR for the highest compared to the lowest quintile
  of 0.36 (95% CI: 0.22-0.60; _p_ for trend 0.003), with significant heterogeneity
  between ER−/PR− and ER+/PR+ tumors (_p_ for heterogeneity = 0.03).'
- The additional consideration of HER2 expression for tumor subtypes did not indicate
  effect heterogeneity.
- There was a significant inverse association of enterolactone levels with breast
  cancer for ER−/PR−/HER2+ (71 cases, _p_ for trend = 0.05) as well as ER−/PR−/HER2−
  (triple negative) tumors (130 cases and _p_ for trend = 0.004).
- 'For ER+/PR+/HER− tumors (540 cases), a significant association was observed only
  for the highest quintile (OR = 0.68; 95% CI: 0.50-0.94, _p_ for trend = 0.003).'
- There was no association with ER+/PR+/HER+ tumors (87 cases and _p_ for trend =
  0.5).
- However, results by HER2 expression should be interpreted with caution due to the
  relatively small sample size in these subgroups.
- Median enterolactone levels were 22.0 and 21.5 nmol/l for blood donation before
  and after chemotherapy, respectively.
- The association between serum enterolactone and postmenopausal breast cancer risk
  did not differ by blood collection before or after start of chemotherapy (_p_ for
  heterogeneity = 0.5) nor by blood collection within or after the median time between
  diagnosis and blood collection (_p_ for heterogeneity = 0.7).
- The breast cancer REs of studies included in the meta-analysis are shown in (Fig.
- 1).
- 'Overall, a significant association with breast cancer risk was observed, with a
  pooled RE of 0.72 (95% CI: 0.55-0.88) comparing the highest quantile to the reference
  (lowest) quantile of enterolactone.'
- 'For postmenopausal women, the highest quantile was associated with a significantly
  reduced pooled RE of 0.66 (95% CI: 0.55-0.77).'
- 'When stratifying the analysis for studies on postmenopausal breast cancer risk
  by study design, we observed a significantly reduced postmenopausal breast cancer
  risk both in prospective cohort/nested case-control studies and in case-control
  studies with pooled RE of 0.70 (95% CI: 0.52-0.88) and pooled RE of 0.64 (95% CI:
  0.49-0.78), respectively (Fig.'
- 2).

- Horizontal lines indicate 95% CIs for the respective RE.
- Prospective cohorts/ nested case-control studies (cohorts) and case-control studies
  (c/c) are shown.
- We found that circulating enterolactone concentrations in the highest compared to
  the lowest quintile were associated with statistically significantly reduced risk
  of postmenopausal breast cancer.
- Moreover, the relationship between serum enterolactone and postmenopausal breast
  cancer risk was nonlinear.
- The inverse associations with serum enterolactone were significantly stronger for
  ER− compared to ER+ tumors but did not differ by PR status of the tumor.
- The risk reduction associated with high enterolactone levels was also significantly
  stronger for ER−/PR− compared to ER+/PR+ tumors and did not further differ by HER2
  expression.
- Our findings of a significant inverse association of serum enterolactone with postmenopausal
  breast cancer risk corroborate the results of a relatively large Danish prospective
  cohort study (381 cases and 381 controls).31 Several previous studies on serum,
  plasma and urine enterolactone concentrations in postmenopausal women found inverse
  but not statistically significant associations with breast cancer risk3, 32 or no
  association.17, 33-35 This could have been in part due to small sample sizes of
  each of these studies and corresponding limited statistical power to detect a possible
  inverse association of enterolactone.
- Our previous meta-analysis including seven published studies showed that high serum
  or urinary levels of enterolactone are negatively but not significantly associated
  with postmenopausal breast cancer risk.22 Inclusion of the present study yielded
  a significantly increased pooled RE for an association of higher enterolactone levels
  with reduced postmenopausal breast cancer risk.
- This change in the pooled RE emphasizes the need for large studies to provide substantive
  evidence for an inverse association of lignan exposure with postmenopausal breast
  cancer risk.
- To assess whether study design had an effect on the association of serum enterolactone
  on postmenopausal breast cancer risk, we also performed a meta-analysis by study
  type.
- Although not all prospective studies reported (nonsignificant) inverse associations,
  the pooled REs did not indicate differential effects by study type.
- Therefore, the overall evidence up to date supports an inverse association between
  serum enterolactone levels and postmenopausal breast cancer risk.
- Overall, the association was weaker in the prospective-cohort studies than in the
  case-control studies.
- Because blood withdrawal is before diagnosis in prospective cohort studies and generally
  after diagnosis of breast cancer in case-control studies, it is possible that serum
  concentrations are influenced by the diagnosis and therapy of breast cancer and
  therefore bias results in case-control studies.
- In addition, the potential for selection bias and residual confounding in case-control
  studies could also lead to bias.
- Nevertheless, no heterogeneity was observed in the pooled REs of postmenopausal
  breast cancer risk when stratified by study design.
- Our study was conducted in a large German study population, with a diet relatively
  high in whole-grain products, berries and vegetables that are rich sources of lignans.
- In addition, participants were mostly nonsmokers, and their alcohol consumption
  was moderate.
- It is known that smoking is inversely correlated with serum enterolactone levels
  and that moderate alcohol consumption is positively correlated with serum enterolactone
  levels.36, 37 This may partially explain the relatively high median serum enterolactone
  levels in our study population compared to other studies.3, 33, 34, 38, 39 In our
  study population, a reduction in OR for breast cancer was already apparent in the
  second quintile although the ORs decreased further with higher enterolactone concentrations.
- The median or range of our lowest quintile is comparable to several studies that
  also reported a negative yet nonsignificant association with postmenopausal breast
  cancer risk.3, 33, 34 Moreover, significant inverse association was observed in
  two studies with generally high-serum enterolactone levels comparable to our study
  but only when considering the second quantile as reference group.31, 40 Compared
  to the higher quintiles, there were more participants with BMI above 30 and more
  smokers in the lowest quintile in our study.
- These variables were accounted for in the multivariable logistic models; however,
  we cannot entirely exclude residual confounding.
- Lignans are present in high amounts in fiber rich food (whole grain), fruits and
  vegetables.
- We assessed potential confounding by these food groups in multivariable logistic
  models but observed no substantial change in the REs and therefore did not include
  them in the final models.
- In addition, adjustment for energy intake did not influence the REs.
- 'Our observation of an inverse association with circulating enterolactone concentrations
  independent of ER and PR status is in line with postulated antiproliferative and
  anticarcinogenic properties of enterolactone, in addition to antiestrogenic properties.7,
  41 The effect was stronger among ER- tumors that could be attributable to anticarcinogenic
  properties of lignans that do not involve ERs, such as their influence on enzymes,
  proteins, angiogenesis and cell differentiation.10, 42


  The literature regarding the association of serum enterolignans with postmenopausal
  breast cancer risk by ER or PR status of the tumor is limited.'
- A prospective study conducted in the United Kingdom reported no difference by ER
  status of the tumor in a population of predominantly postmenopausal women.43 However,
  an association of plasma enterolactone with a decreased risk of ER− but not ER+
  postmenopausal breast cancer was observed in a Danish study.31 A Swedish study among
  postmenopausal women observed an inverse association of plasma enterolactone for
  ERα (positive) and ERβ (negative) tumors, with significantly different REs for ERβ
  (negative) and ERβ (positive) tumors.40 When combining our findings by ER status
  with those of the first two published studies31, 43 included in our recently published
  meta-analysis,22 the pooled estimates for ER+ tumors and ER− tumors were 0.72 (0.65-0.80)
  and 0.47 (0.21-0.73), respectively, nevertheless, without significant heterogeneity
  between the estimates (_p_ for heterogeneity 0.07).
- Therefore, further large studies will be required to confirm whether the association
  is differential by ER status.
- The association between measured enterolignans and breast cancer risk by PR status
  has not been investigated previously.
- 'A large prospective study investigated the effect of dietary enterolignans (estimated
  from FFQs), by ER and PR status of the tumor and reported an inverse association
  of dietary enterolactone for both ER− and PR+ tumors.44


  We observed an inverse association of enterolactone for both ER+/PR+ and ER−/PR−
  tumors, but the association was stronger in ER−/PR−.'
- To our knowledge, the effect of serum enterolignans has not been previously assessed
  according to combined ER/PR tumor status.
- 'Only one study investigated association of calculated enterolignans with breast
  cancer risk by combined ER/PR status and reported an inverse association for ER+/PR+
  but not for ER−/PR− tumors.44


  This is the first study to consider heterogeneity of the risk association of serum
  enterolactone also by HER2 expression.'
- Our data, suggesting no differential risk by HER2 status, are corroborated by the
  absence of other lines of evidence for an effect of enterolactone on HER2 expression.
- Sample sizes in these subgroups were limited, and further studies with larger number
  of participants are needed to confirm these results.
- Our study has several methodological advantages.
- To our knowledge, it is the largest study with sufficient power to investigate the
  association of serum enterolactone with postmenopausal breast cancer risk.
- We restricted our analyses to postmenopausal women and investigated risk associations
  by ER and PR status and, additionally, by HER2 status.
- We used fractional polynomials to identify the best-fitted model for the data.
- Moreover, two sensitivity analyses were performed to investigate whether time of
  blood collection (prior or after median time of diagnosis) or chemotherapy (prior
  of after start of chemotherapy) influence the association with serum enterolactone
  levels, and no heterogeneity was observed.
- Similar to most epidemiological studies, only one measure of enterolactone in nonfasting
  serum samples was performed, which might not reflect long-term exposure to lignan-rich
  diets.
- Nevertheless, feeding studies showed that serum enterolactone levels do not decrease
  rapidly.13 In addition, another study showed that the reliability coefficient of
  a single measurement of enterolactone was relatively high, _i.e_., 0.6 for three
  repeated measurements during 2 years.45 Antibiotic use was not recorded that might
  have influenced the bioavailability of phytoestrogens.18 Moreover, biomarker measurements
  provide more precise data than dietary information, reflecting the bioavailable
  amount of ingested lignans.
- Furthermore, serum levels may have been also influenced by the disease status as
  blood samples were collected after breast cancer diagnosis, thereby not representing
  prediagnosis levels.
- In conclusion, results of our study suggest that high enterolactone levels are inversely
  associated with postmenopausal breast cancer risk in this Western population.
- The inverse association was stronger for ER−/PR− than for ER+/PR+ tumors, but did
  not appear to be different from further stratification according to expression of
  HER2.
- These findings may have important health implications for women in Western populations
  with very low phytoestrogen consumption.
- Further prospective studies in large populations with large range in intake levels
  of lignans are needed to define the association between circulating enterolactone
  levels and the subsequent risk of breast cancer according to menopausal status and
