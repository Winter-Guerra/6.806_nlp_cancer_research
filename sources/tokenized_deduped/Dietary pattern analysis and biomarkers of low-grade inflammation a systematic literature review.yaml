- The purpose of the present literature review was to investigate and summarize the
  current evidence on associations between dietary patterns and biomarkers of inflammation,
  as derived from epidemiological studies.
- A systematic literature search was conducted using PubMed, Web of Science, and EMBASE,
  and a total of 46 studies were included in the review.
- These studies predominantly applied principal component analysis, factor analysis,
  reduced rank regression analysis, the Healthy Eating Index, or the Mediterranean
  Diet Score.
- No prospective observational study was found.
- Patterns identified by reduced rank regression as being statistically significantly
  associated with biomarkers of inflammation were almost all meat-based or “Western”
  patterns.
- Studies using principal component analysis or _a priori_-defined diet scores found
  that meat-based or “Western-like” patterns tended to be positively associated with
  biomarkers of inflammation, predominantly C-reactive protein, while vegetable- and
  fruit-based or “healthy” patterns tended to be inversely associated.
- While results of the studies were inconsistent, interventions with presumed healthy
  diets resulted in reductions of almost all investigated inflammatory biomarkers.
- In conclusion, prospective studies are warranted to confirm the reported findings
  and further analyze associations, particularly by investigating dietary patterns
  as risk factors for changes in inflammatory markers over time.
