- The aim of this study was to review studies that evaluated the effects of cooking
  techniques on carotenoids and anthocyanins in vegetables and to release a meta-analysis
  of the findings.
- A literature search was conducted to identify studies that evaluated the effects
  of cooking techniques on the levels of carotenoids and anthocyanins in vegetables.
- The database search found 404 results, and an additional 18 articles from 1992 to
  2013 were selected that met the inclusion criteria.
- A meta-analysis with a random effect model was conducted using the weighted response
  ratios (_R_) calculated for each experiment.
- Significant reductions of carotenoid levels after microwaving (_R_ = 0.79) and frying
  (_R_ = 0.59) and an increase after stewing (_R_ = 1.33) were reported; for anthocyanins,
  reduction was observed after moist-heat techniques such as pressure boiling (_R_
  = 0.11) and pressure steaming (_R_ = 0.01), and steaming tended to reduce their
  concentration (_R_ = 0.34; _p_ = 0.054).
- Increases of anthocyanin levels were observed in dry-heat cooking techniques such
  as microwaving (_R_ = 3.51) and baking (_R_ = 2.95).
- Cooking techniques influence the levels of natural pigments in vegetables, and depending
  on the technique, their levels may increase or decrease.
- Carotenoids were most degraded in frying and most increased during the stewing technique,
  while anthocyanins were most degraded in pressure steaming and most increased in
  the microwaving technique.
