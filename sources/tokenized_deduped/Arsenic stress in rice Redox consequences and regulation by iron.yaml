- Arsenic (As) contamination is a serious hazard to human health and agriculture.
- It has emerged as an important threat for rice cultivation mainly in South Asian
  countries.
- In this study, we investigated the effect of iron (Fe) supplementation on arsenic
  (AsV) induced oxidative stress responses in rice (_Oryza sativa_ L.).
- Rice seedlings treated with AsV for 24 and 48 h in presence or absence of 2.5 mM
  Fe after which the root and shoot tissues were harvested for analysis.
- The results indicate significant (_p_ ≤ 0.05) reduction in root and shoot length/dry
  biomass.
- Supplementation of Fe showed improved growth responses under stress as compared
  to AsV alone.
- The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis of roots under AsV treatment for
  48 h showed major alterations in root structure and integrity, although no noticeable
  changes were observed in Fe - supplemented seedlings.
- Significantly high (_p_ ≤ 0.05) accumulation of AsV was observed in root and shoot
  after 24 and 48 h of stress.
- However, under Fe - supplementation As accumulation in root and shoot were considerably
  low after 24 and 48 h of AsV treatment.
- The hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and malondialdehyde (MDA) content in both root and
  shoot increased significantly (_p_ ≤ 0.05) after 24 and 48 h of AsV treatment.
- In Fe - supplemented seedlings, the levels of H2O2 and MDA were considerably low
  as compared to AsV alone.
- Ascorbate (AsA) and glutathione (GSH) levels also increased significantly (_p_ ≤
  0.05) under AsV stress as compared to control and Fe-supplemented seedlings.
- Activities of catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were significantly (_p_
  ≤ 0.05) high after 24 and 48 h of AsV treatment as compared to Fe-supplemented seedlings.
- The gene expression analysis revealed up-regulation of metallothionein (_MT1_, _MT2_)
  and nodulin 26-like intrinsic protein (_NIP2;1_) genes after 5d of As treatment,
  while their expressions were repressed under Fe-supplementation.
- Our results indicate that Fe regulates oxidative stress and promotes growth under
  As stress.
