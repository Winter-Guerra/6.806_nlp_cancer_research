- The vast majority of the tomato crop is harvested at mature green stage and ripened
  off of the plant for fresh market consumption.
- The other large amount of crop is harvested when the fruit has reached to fully
  mature red stage which is called “vine-ripened”.
- Here we attempt to answer and clarify if there is any difference between the antioxidant
  capacity of postharvest ripened and vine ripe tomatoes.
- Greenhouse grown tomatoes (cv.
- Newton) were harvested at four different ripening stages of unripe and vine ripe.
- Total phenolic (TP) contents and antioxidant capacity by the FRAP (ferric reducing
  antioxidant power) and TEAC (trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity) assays were
  performed on all ripening stages.
- Results of the present study demonstrated that tomato peel has significantly higher
  TP content and antioxidant capacity than the pulp tissues in all maturity stages
  tested.
- TP and antioxidant capacity of tomato fruits were affected during postharvest ripening
  process.
- If only pulp tissue considered, TAC of vine-ripened and postharvest ripened pink
  tomatoes has similar amount, but significantly higher content than mature green,
  breaker and turning maturity stages.
- If peel tissue measured, the mean separations identified three groups.
- Postharvest ripened mature green stage has the most TAC, followed by vine-ripened
  and pink stage.
- Postharvest breaker and turning stages have the least amount of TAC.
