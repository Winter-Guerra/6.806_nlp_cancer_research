- The n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid 5-lipoxygenase pathway has been shown to play
  a role in the carcinogenesis of breast cancer.
- We conducted a population-based case-control study among Latina, African-American,
  and White women from the San Francisco Bay area to examine the association of the
  5-lipoxygenase gene (_ALOX5_) and 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein gene (_ALOX5AP_)
  with breast cancer risk.
- Three _ALOX5AP_ polymorphisms [poly(A) microsatellite, −4900 A&gt;G (rs4076128),
  and −3472 A&gt;G (rs4073259)] and three _ALOX5_ polymorphisms [Sp1-binding site
  (-GGGCGG-) variable number of tandem repeat polymorphism, −1279 G&gt;T (rs6593482),
  and 760 G&gt;A (rs2228065)] were genotyped in 802 cases and 888 controls.
- We did not find significant main effects of _ALOX5_ and _ALOX5AP_ genotypes on breast
  cancer risk that were consistent across race or ethnicity; however, there was a
  significant interaction between the _ALOX5AP_ −4900 A&gt;G polymorphism and dietary
  linoleic acid intake (_P_ = 0.03).
- Among women consuming a diet high in linoleic acid (top quartile of intake, &gt;17.4
  g/d), carrying the AA genotype was associated with higher breast cancer risk (age-
  and race-adjusted odds ratio, 1.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-2.9) compared with
  carrying genotypes AG or GG.
- Among women consuming ≤17.4 g/d of linoleic acid, _ALOX5AP_ −4900 genotype was not
  associated with breast cancer risk (age- and race-adjusted odds ratio, 0.9; 95%
  confidence interval, 0.7-1.2).
- These results support a role for n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids in breast carcinogenesis
  and suggest that epidemiologic studies on dietary fat and breast cancer should take
  into account genetic predisposition related to n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid metabolism.
