- Intake of _trans_ fatty acids (TFA) may influence systemic inflammation, insulin
  resistance and adiposity, but whether TFA intake influences cancer risk is insufficiently
  studied.
- We examined the association between TFA intake from partially hydrogenated vegetable
  oils (PHVO-TFA), partially hydrogenated fish oils (PHFO-TFA), and ruminant fat (rTFA)
  and cancer risk in the Norwegian counties study, a large cohort study with a participation
  rate &gt;80%.
- TFA intake was assessed three times in 1974-1988 by questionnaire.
- A total of 77,568 men and women were followed up through 2007, during which time
  12,004 cancer cases occurred.
- Hazard ratios (HRs) and confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated with Cox regression
  for cancer sites with â‰¥150 cases during follow-up.
- Significantly increased or decreased risks were found when comparing the highest
  and lowest intake categories (HRs, 95% CIs) for PHVO-TFA and pancreatic cancer in
  men (0.52, 0.31-0.87) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in both genders (0.70, 0.50-0.98);
  PHFO-TFA and rectal cancer (1.43, 1.09-1.88), prostate cancer (0.82, 0.69-0.96),
  and multiple myeloma (2.02, 1.24-3.28); and rTFA and all cancers (1.09, 1.02-1.16),
  cancer of the mouth/pharynx (1.59, 1.08-2.35), NHL (1.47, 1.06-2.04) and multiple
  myeloma (0.45, 0.24-0.84).
- Furthermore, positive trends were found for PHFO-TFA and stomach cancer (_p_trend
  = 0.01) and rTFA and postmenopausal breast cancer (_p_trend = 0.03).
- Inverse trends were found for PHVO-TFA and all cancers (_p_trend = 0.006) and cancer
  of the central nervous system in women (_p_trend = 0.005).
- PHFO-TFA, but not PHVO-TFA, seemed to increase cancer risk.
- The increased risks observed for rTFA may be linked to saturated fat.
- Observational studies and randomized trials have found that intake of _trans_ fatty
  acids (TFA) has unfavorable effects on multiple risk factors for cardiovascular
  diseases, including blood lipids, lipoproteins and endothelial function.1 For this
  reason the association between TFA intake and cardiovascular disease risk has been
  extensively studied.2 TFA intake may also influence factors related to cancer risk
  such as systemic inflammation, insulin resistance, and adiposity,1, 3 but the association
  between TFA intake and cancer risk has not been sufficiently studied.4 A few studies
  on colon/colorectal, breast and prostate cancer have rendered inconclusive results,5,
  6 and the number of studies on other cancer sites is limited.
- Dietary TFA derive from three main sources; partially hydrogenated vegetable oils
  (PHVO), partially hydrogenated fish oils (PHFO), and ruminant fat.
- TFA from PHVO (PHVO-TFA) and PHFO (PHFO-TFA) are industrially produced and used
  in the production of margarines and fats used for baking and deep frying.
- Intake of PHFO-TFA was high in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Germany, Eastern
  Europe and Norway.7 TFA from ruminant fat (rTFA) occur naturally in small amounts
  in dairy products and meat from ruminant animals.
- TFA from these three sources differ in terms of carbon chain length, position, and
  number of _trans_ bonds.
- Thus, the health effects may also be different.8, 9 Most previous studies on TFA
  intake and cancer risk have not distinguished between different sources of TFA,
  and to our knowledge, no previous study has specifically evaluated the effect of
  PHFO-TFA on cancer risk.
- The Norwegian counties study is a large population-based cohort study of both men
  and women.
- The study has a very high participation rate, repeated exposure assessment, including
  detailed information on TFA intake from different sources,7 and 30 years of complete
  follow-up.
- This gives us the unique possibility to investigate the associations between PHVO-TFA,
  PHFO-TFA and rTFA intake and the risk of several cancers.

  The Norwegian Counties Study was carried out between 1974 and 1988 in the three
  counties in Norway: Finnmark, Oppland and Sogn og Fjordane.'
- The study consisted of three health screenings, which were conducted every 5 years
  in Oppland and Sogn og Fjordane, whereas in Finnmark, screenings II and III were
  carried out 3 and 13 years, respectively, after screening I.
- In all three counties, residents aged 35-49 years, and a random sample aged 20-34
  years were invited to screening I, in total 34,115 men and 31,509 women.10 All residents
  were reinvited to screening II if they had been invited to screening I.
- Previously invited residents were also reinvited to screening III, except that among
  residents of Oppland and Sogn og Fjordane aged 55 years or older only a random sample
  was reinvited.
- In addition, samples of younger residents not previously invited were invited to
  screening II (ages 17-39 years) and screening III (ages 20-39 years).
- The attendance rate was 88% at screenings I and II, and 84% at screening III.
- In total, 92,234 persons attended at least one health screening.
- At each health screening, a team of specially trained nurses examined and interviewed
  the participants.
- Height, weight and blood pressure were measured, and a nonfasting blood sample was
  collected and analyzed for triglycerides and total cholesterol.
- Information on smoking habits and recreational and occupational physical activity
  was obtained by questionnaire.
- During the interview, the questionnaire was checked for inconsistencies, and women
  were asked about menopausal status.
- 'The participants'' education level was obtained from Statistics Norway.7


  The present study was approved by the Norwegian Data Inspectorate and the Regional
  Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics, Southeast Norway.'
- A semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was handed out at screenings
  II and III.
- As it was not distributed in all municipalities, only 59% of the participants received
  the FFQ at screening I.
- A detailed description of the FFQ, its reproducibility and validity has been published
  elsewhere.11 The FFQ was primarily designed to detect the main sources of fat in
  the Norwegian diet and included 80 food items.
- The nutrient composition of the food items in the FFQ was obtained from the Norwegian
  food composition table most relevant for the period of data collection.
- Food items that contributed to the calculation of nutrient intake included bread,
  fats on bread, spreads, cheese, milk, cakes, eggs, meat and fish dishes, potatoes
  and cod liver oil supplement.
- Standard portion sizes were used for most of the food items.
- TFA intake was calculated using the fatty acid composition of the food items, margarines
  and fats used by the baking industry at the time of the screenings.
- During the study period, PHVO was derived from soybean oil and PHFO from different
  fish oils.
- A more detailed description of the production procedures have been published previously.7
  We calculated PHFO-TFA intake and PHVO-TFA intake based on the amount consumed of
  baking fat and different types of margarine.
- Food items that contributed to intake of baking fat were store-brought bread and
  cake.
- Margarine intake included margarine used on bread, for frying fish, and on meat
  and fish dishes.
- We did not have information on deep-fried food items or snacks that may contain
  industrial TFA.
- However, these foods represented only a small proportion of industrial TFA intake.12
  Calculation of rTFA intake was based on consumption of dairy products and ruminant
  meat products.
- If more than 10 questions on any FFQ were unanswered, we did not calculate that
  participant's nutrient intake for the corresponding health screening.
- Of participants who received the FFQ, nutrient intakes were estimated for 93% at
  screening I, 82% at screening II, and 84% at screening III.
- At each health screening, we eliminated nutrient intakes if the ratio of energy
  intake to basal metabolic rate13 was in the screening-specific top and bottom 1%,
  leaving 79,227 participants with nutrient intakes from at least one screening (Fig.
- 1).
- Information on cancer incidence, and death or emigration was obtained through linkages
  to the Cancer Registry of Norway and Statistics Norway, using the unique identification
  number assigned to all Norwegian citizens.
- The Cancer Registry of Norway was used to obtain information on cancer site and
  histology.
- The baseline screening represented the start of follow-up, and was defined as the
  first health screening a participant attended when (_i_) they were aged 18 years
  or above, (_ii_) fat intake could be estimated, (_iii_) questions about smoking
  and physical activity were answered, and (_iv_) weight and height were measured.
- We excluded participants whose screenings did not fulfill the criteria for a baseline
  screening, as well as those without information on education level, those who emigrated
  or were diagnosed with cancer before start of follow up, and participants who died,
  emigrated, or were diagnosed with cancer during the first year of follow-up.
- After these exclusions, 77,568 participants (50.4% men) were included in the analyses
  (Fig.
- 1).
- Of these, 37,439 had one measurement of TFA intake, 24,095 had two measurements
  and 16,034 had three measurements.
- Participants were then followed up until the date of cancer diagnosis, death, emigration
  or December 31, 2007, whichever occurred first.
- Participants with cancer at multiple sites with the same date of diagnosis were
  included as events in analyses of all cancers, but were censored at diagnosis in
  site-specific analyses.
- Cancers were categorized using the international classification of diseases, tenth
  edition, as in "Cancer in Norway.
- '"14 In the present study we considered only cancer sites with 150 events or more
  during follow-up (Table 1).'
- Breast cancers were defined as premenopausal if at the date of diagnosis, menopause
  had not yet been reported at a health screening, and the woman was younger than
  55 years of age; otherwise they were defined as postmenopausal breast cancers.15
  Histological grade was available for 920 (49.8%) prostate cancers, which were classified
  as low-grade (high or intermediate differentiation, _n_ = 709) or high-grade (low
  or no differentiation, _n_ = 211).
- For all the sites we studied, &gt;90% of the cancer cases were morphologically verified,
  except pancreas and central nervous system (CNS), for which 86.9 and 78.9% of cases,
  respectively, were morphologically verified.
- TFA intake was measured as percent of energy intake (% of kJ dayâˆ’1 = _E_%).
- 'At each health screening, TFA intake was classified into five categories: &lt;
  0.15, 0.15-0.649, 0.65-1.149, 1.15-1.649 or â‰¥ 1.65 _E_% for PHVO-TFA; &lt; 0.85,
  0.85-1.349, 1.35-1.849, 1.85-2.349 or â‰¥ 2.35 _E_% for PHFO-TFA and &lt; 0.4, 0.4-0.549,
  0.55-0.699, 0.7-0.849 or â‰¥ 0.85 _E_% for rTFA.'
- These categories were chosen to establish intake cut-off points at regular intervals
  and to define categories with a sufficient number of events.
- We did not use percentiles to define intake categories because of the changes in
  intake that occurred between health screenings.
- Level of physical activity was classified as sedentary, moderately active or active
  at each health screening by combining the categories of occupational and recreational
  physical activity.16 Participants were classified as never, former or current smokers,
  and were classified as former instead of never-smokers at a given screening if they
  had been previously classified as former or current smoker.
- Education level was categorized as primary schooling (â‰¤9 years), secondary education
  (10-12 years) or university level education (â‰¥13 years), according to the most recent
  information available from Statistics Norway.
- Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between
  TFA intake and cancer risk were estimated with Cox regression.
- We used a stratified Cox model with year of birth in 5-year intervals as the strata
  (&lt;1930, 1930-34, 1935-39, 1940-44 and â‰¥ 1945) and attained age as the time variable.
- All analyses were adjusted for gender, except analyses of breast, cervical, endometrial
  and ovarian cancer, in which only women were included; and analyses of prostate
  cancer, in which only men were included.
- The model also included energy intake (kJ dayâˆ’1, as a continuous variable), level
  of physical activity, smoking, body mass index (BMI) (kg mâˆ’2, as a continuous variable),
  and education level.
- These covariates are established risk factors for cancer.
- All variables, except gender and education level, were modeled as time-dependent.
- Values for participants were updated at each subsequent screening that fulfilled
  the same criteria as the baseline screening (see above).
- For TFA and energy intake, we used the mean of intakes from all preceding attended
  screenings since start of follow-up.7, 17 For level of physical activity, smoking,
  and BMI, we used values from the most recent preceding attended screening.7 For
  cancers of the breast, cervix, endometrium and ovary, additional adjustment for
  age at first birth (=20, 21-25, 26-30, &gt;30 years, or no children) did not change
  the results, and this was not included in the final model.
- In analyses of premenopausal breast cancer, women were censored at onset of menopause.
- In analyses of postmenopausal breast cancer, onset of menopause was considered the
  start of follow-up.
- Analyses of prostate cancer included cases without information on histological grade,
  but these were censored at diagnosis in analyses of low-grade and high-grade prostate
  cancer.
- For cancers of the mouth and pharynx, pancreas and lung, for which smoking is an
  important risk factor, we performed subanalyses restricted to never-smokers to explore
  residual confounding due to potentially insufficient adjustment for smoking.
- We also performed additional analyses including only morphologically verified cancer
  cases of the pancreas and central nervous system.
- The results were similar to the results for morphologically verified and unverified
  cases combined and are therefore not presented.
- To test for linear trends, TFA intake was modeled continuously.
- We tested for interaction between TFA intake and gender.
- For the events where the interaction test was significant, interaction terms between
  intake and gender were added to the model.
- We also tested for interaction between TFA intake and follow-up time (&lt; 10 years
  or â‰¥ 10 years after last measurement of nutrient intake).
- Because the interaction test lacks power,18 it was done only for events with at
  least 150 cases in each follow-up time period, namely all cancers, colon, rectal,
  lung, cutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM), postmenopausal breast, endometrial and
  prostate cancers.
- We used a likelihood ratio test to test for interaction, with TFA intake modeled
  continuously.
- Linear trend was tested with a likelihood ratio test in models without interaction
  and a Wald test in models with interaction between TFA intake and gender.
- All tests were two-sided and _p_ &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
- The analyses were performed using SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
- A total of 12,004 men and women were diagnosed with cancer during a mean follow-up
  of 24.8 years (Table 1).
- Baseline mean PHVO-TFA intake was 0.9 _E_% (median 0.7 _E_%, range 0.0-6.2 _E_%).
- In the highest intake category, 70.5% were men (Table 2).
- PHVO-TFA intake was inversely related to rTFA intake and positively related to polyunsaturated
  _cis_ fatty acid intake.
- The Spearman correlation coefficient between PHVO-TFA intake and polyunsaturated
  _cis_ fatty acid intake was 0.65.
- The proportion of current smokers was highest in the highest PHVO-TFA intake category.
- For PHVO-TFA, we found significant, inverse trends for all cancers (_p_trend = 0.006),
  pancreatic cancer in men (_p_trend = 0.007), CMM in men (_p_trend = 0.03), nonmelanoma
  skin cancer (_p_trend = 0.03), cancer of the CNS in women (_p_trend = 0.005) and
  non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) (_p_trend = 0.04).
- Significantly decreased risks in the highest compared to the lowest intake category
  were observed only for pancreatic cancer and NHL (Table 3).
- Moreover, for CMM and nonmelanoma skin cancer, we did not find significantly decreased
  risks in any intake category, and in fact men in intake category 2 (0.15-0.649 _E_%)
  were at significantly increased risk of CMM.
- We found significant interactions between PHVO-TFA intake and gender for pancreatic
  cancer (_p_interaction = 0.02), CMM (_p_interaction = 0.04) and cancer of the CNS
  (_p_interaction = 0.02).
- Results for low-grade and high-grade prostate cancer (data not shown) were similar
  to results for all prostate cancers.
- For cancers of the mouth and pharynx, pancreas and lung, results for never-smokers
  were similar to results for all participants, but the inverse association found
  for pancreatic cancers in men was no longer significant (data not shown).
- The associations between intake and cancer risk did not differ by follow-up time
  (&lt; 10 years or â‰¥ 10 years after last measurement).
- Baseline PHFO-TFA intake was considerably higher than PHVO-TFA intake, mean 1.6
  _E_% (median 1.3 _E_%, range 0.0-11.7 _E_%).
- In the lowest intake category, 64.4% were men (Table 2).
- The lowest proportion of participants with university level education was found
  in the highest intake category.
- With increasing PHFO-TFA intake, PHVO-TFA and rTFA intakes decreased, total fat
  intake increased and monounsaturated _cis_ fatty acid and carbohydrate intake decreased.
- Total serum cholesterol increased with increasing PHFO-TFA intake.
- The proportion of current smokers was highest in the lowest intake category.
- Significant positive trends were found for stomach cancer (_p_trend = 0.01) and
  multiple myeloma (_p_trend = 0.003, Table 4).
- Furthermore, participants in all intake categories except category 4 (1.85-2.349
  _E_%) were at significantly increased risk of rectal cancer compared to participants
  in the lowest intake category.
- Participants in the highest intake category were also at increased risk of pancreatic
  cancer, but this was not significant.
- Significant inverse trends were found for lung cancer in women (_p_trend = 0.0003)
  and prostate cancer (_p_trend = 0.002).
- Moreover, inverse associations were found in analyses of both low-grade and high-grade
  prostate cancer, but the association was significant for low-grade prostate cancer
  only (data not shown).
- We found a significant interaction between PHFO-TFA intake and gender for lung cancer
  only (_p_interaction = 0.001).
- No significant interactions were found between PHFO-TFA intake and follow-up time,
  except for all cancers (_p_interaction = 0.004), in which HRs per 0.5 _E_% increase
  in intake were 1.02 (95% CI 1.01, 1.04) for follow-up &lt; 10 years after last measurement
  and 0.99 (95% CI 0.98, 1.00) for follow-up â‰¥ 10 years after last measurement of
  nutrient intake.
- When restricting the analyses of lung cancer to never-smokers, we found a significant,
  positive association between PHFO-TFA intake and risk in men (HR per 0.5 _E_% increase
  in intake was 1.33, 95% CI 1.08, 1.63) and a weak, nonsignificant, positive association
  in women (HR per 0.5 _E_% increase in intake was 1.11, 95% CI 0.88, 1.40).
- For cancers of the mouth and pharynx and pancreas, results in never-smokers were
  similar to results in all participants (data not shown).
- Baseline mean intake of rTFA was 0.6 _E_% (median 0.5 _E_%, range 0-2.0 _E_%), considerably
  lower than PHVO-TFA and PHFO-TFA intake.
- The proportion of participants with university level education decreased with increasing
  rTFA intake (Table 2).
- rTFA intake was inversely related to both PHVO-TFA and PHFO-TFA intake.
- Furthermore, rTFA intake was positively related to total fat, saturated fat and
  monounsaturated _cis_ fatty acid intakes; and inversely related to polyunsaturated
  _cis_ fatty acid intake.
- The Spearman correlation coefficient between rTFA and saturated fat intakes was
  0.86.
- Mean total serum cholesterol and serum triglycerides were highest in the highest
  rTFA intake category.
- The proportion of current smokers increased, while the proportion of sedentary participants
  decreased with increasing rTFA intake.
- We found significant, positive trends for all cancers, (_p_trend = 0.002), cancer
  of the mouth and pharynx (_p_trend = 0.006), nonmelanoma skin cancer (_p_trend =
  0.04), postmenopausal breast cancer (_p_trend = 0.03) and NHL (_p_trend = 0.01),
  with a significantly increased risk in the highest compared to the lowest intake
  category, except for postmenopausal breast cancer, for which we found a significantly
  increased risk in intake category 3 (0.55-0.699 _E_%), but not in the highest intake
  category (Table 5).
- We also found an indication of a positive trend for cancer of the CNS (_p_trend
  = 0.05).
- Significant inverse trends were found for multiple myeloma (_p_trend = 0.01) and
  for CMM in women (_p_trend = 0.04), but risk was significantly lower in the highest
  compared to the lowest intake category only for multiple myeloma.
- Intake was not associated with either low-grade or high-grade prostate cancer (data
  not shown).
- Significant interaction between rTFA intake and gender was only found for CMM (_p_interaction
  = 0.01).
- Furthermore, significant interactions between intake and follow-up were observed
  for all cancers (_p_interaction = 0.0007) and CMM (_p_interaction = 0.03).
- For all cancers, HRs and 95% CIs per 0.5 _E_% increase were 0.96 (0.89, 1.03) for
  follow-up &lt; 10 years and 1.10 (1.06, 1.15) for follow-up â‰¥ 10 years after last
  measurement of nutrient intake.
- For CMM, corresponding HRs and 95% CIs were 0.89 (0.63, 1.27) and 1.39 (1.06, 1.82)
  for men, and 0.53 (0.34, 0.81) and 0.82 (0.56, 1.20) for women.
- Intake of rTFA was associated with increased risk of cancer of the mouth and pharynx
  in never-smokers also, but not significantly.
- We found no association between rTFA intake and risk of cancers of the pancreas
  and lung in never-smokers (data not shown).
- TFA from different sources showed different associations with cancer risk.
- More unfavorable risks were found for PHFO-TFA and rTFA intake than for PHVO-TFA
  intake.
- For PHFO-TFA, we observed significant positive trends for stomach cancer and multiple
  myeloma, with significantly increased risk of multiple myeloma in the highest compared
  to lowest intake category.
- Furthermore, we found significantly increased risk of rectal cancer in the highest
  compared to lowest intake category.
- Significant inverse trends were observed for prostate cancer and lung cancer in
  women.
- However, for lung cancer, we found a significant positive association in men and
  a nonsignificant positive association in women when restricting the analysis to
  never-smokers.
- For PHVO-TFA, we observed significant inverse trends for all cancers, pancreatic
  cancer in men, CMM in men, nonmelanoma skin cancer, cancer of the CNS in women and
  NHL, with significantly decreased risks in the highest compared to the lowest intake
  category for pancreatic cancer and NHL.
- For rTFA, we found significant positive trends with increased risks in the highest
  compared to the lowest intake category for all cancers, cancer of the mouth and
  pharynx, nonmelanoma skin cancer and NHL.
- Furthermore, we found a significant positive trend for postmenopausal breast cancer.
- Significant inverse trends were found for multiple myeloma and for CMM in women,
  with significantly decreased risk in the highest compared to the lowest intake category
  for multiple myeloma.
- To our knowledge, no previous studies have evaluated the effect of TFA from different
  sources on cancer risk.
- The different associations between cancer risk and TFA from the three sources in
  this report may be related to the different chemical structures of each TFA, which
  may lead to a different site-specific carcinogenic effect.
- rTFA and PHVO-TFA contain isomers with 18 carbon atoms and almost exclusively _trans_
  monoenes (a small amount of _trans_ dienes in PHVO).
- The spectra of isomers are, however, quite different.
- The main isomer in PHVO is elaidic acid (18:1_trans_9) while in ruminant fat it
  is _trans_ vaccenic acid (18:1_trans_11) in addition to conjugated linoleic acid
  (_cis_9, _trans_11CLA).
- PHFO-TFA is a complex mixture of fatty acids of different chain lengths, mainly
  varying between 14 and 24 carbon atoms, with different number of _trans_ bonds and
  with different locations in the molecule.
- It is conceivable that such different chemical structures have different metabolic
  effects.
- We found no associations between PHVO-TFA intake and premenopausal or postmenopausal
  breast cancer risk or prostate cancer risk.
- A few nested case-control studies have examined the effects of elaidic acid on breast
  and prostate cancer risk using biomarkers to assess TFA.
- 'The studies on breast cancer are in accordance with our results, indicating no
  association between elaidic acid and either premenopausal19 or postmenopausal breast
  cancer risk.19-22 In contrast to our results on prostate cancer, elaidic acid was
  associated with a significantly increased risk of nonaggressive and total prostate
  cancer in one study,23 while another study found a nonsignificant positive association
  between elaidic acid and overall prostate cancer risk.24


  We observed inverse associations between PHVO-TFA intake and risk of pancreatic
  cancer in men, cancer of the CNS in women, NHL and all cancers.'
- Total TFA intake, assessed by FFQ, was not associated with pancreatic cancer risk
  in three prospective studies,25-27 but a nonsignificant positive association was
  found in one case-control study.28 Two studies, both using FFQ, examined the association
  between total TFA intake and NHL risk and found positive associations, but they
  were significant in only one of the studies.28, 29 None of the previous studies
  on pancreatic cancer and NHL have differentiated between sources of TFA, and their
  results are therefore not directly comparable with ours.
- Until 1997 in Norway, PHVO was used in vegetable oil-based soft margarines, which
  have a high content of _cis_ monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids.
- We observed a positive association between PHVO-TFA intake and polyunsaturated _cis_
  fatty acid intake.
- 'Polyunsaturated fatty acid intake has been associated with significantly reduced
  NHL risk in previous studies,30, 31 but not with reduced pancreatic cancer risk.25-27


  We found no association between TFA intakes and risk of either colon or rectal cancer.'
- The results from previous studies on colon or colorectal cancer are inconsistent.
- A few case-control studies have found positive associations between total TFA intake
  and risk of colon28, 32 or colorectal cancer,33-35 but some of these positive associations
  were limited to subgroups of participants.32-35 Two case-control studies36, 37 and
  three cohort studies38-40 found no association between total TFA intake and risk
  of colon or colorectal cancer.
- The relation between risk colorectal cancer and specific TFA or TFA from specific
  sources has not been studied previously.
- To our knowledge, no previous studies have examined PHFO-TFA intake alone in relation
  to cancer risk.
- We found an inverse association between PHFO-TFA intake and lung cancer risk in
  women.
- The proportion of current smokers was highest in the lowest category of PHFO-TFA
  intake, and a possible explanation could be that our adjustment for smoking was
  insufficient when studying lung cancer.
- In never-smokers, we found a significant, positive association between PHFO-TFA
  intake and lung cancer risk in men and a positive, nonsignificant association in
  women.
- Thus, a protective effect of PHFO-TFA intake on lung cancer risk seems unlikely.
- 'A previous case-control study reported no association between total TFA intake
  and lung cancer risk.28


  We found inverse associations between PHFO-TFA intake and prostate cancer risk that
  was significant for low-grade, but not for high-grade prostate cancer.'
- Previous findings on TFA intake and prostate cancer are conflicting and illustrate
  the complexity of the matter.
- Brasky et al.
- reported that serum levels of 18:1 TFA and 18:2 TFA were associated with significantly
  decreased risk of high-grade prostate cancer, but not low-grade prostate cancer.41
  In contrast, Chavarro et al.
- found no association between serum levels of TFA and risk of aggressive prostate
  cancer, but 18:1 TFA and 18:2 TFA were associated with a significantly increased
  risk of non-aggressive prostate cancer.23 A study where low-grade prostate cancers
  were excluded found no association for either 16:1 TFA, 18:1 TFA or 18:2 n-6 TFA.42
  A Dutch study found no association between total TFA intake and risk of either localized
  or advanced prostate cancer.43 Moreover, one study found that the association between
  TFA and prostate cancer risk was modified by a genetic polymorphism.44 We did not
  have information about family history or genetic polymorphisms in the present study.
- For rTFA, we found no associations with premenopausal breast cancer or prostate
  cancer risk, but a significant, positive association with postmenopausal breast
  cancer risk.
- _Trans_ vaccenic acid has been reported to be associated with a non-significant
  increased risk of premenopausal breast cancer45 and with both significantly increased45,
  46 and decreased risk47 of postmenopausal breast cancer.
- One study examined _trans_ vaccenic acid and prostate cancer risk, and found a significant,
  positive association.24 _Trans_ vaccenic acid can be desaturated to C18:2 _cis_-9,
  _trans_-11 conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) in humans.48 Also, preformed CLA is found
  in small amounts in ruminant fat.
- Animal models have suggested that CLA may have anticancer properties.48 However,
  results from epidemiological studies in humans on CLA and cancer risk are inconsistent.
- 'A significant inverse association was found in one study on colorectal cancer49
  and one study on breast cancer.47 Other studies on breast cancer have found no association45,
  50, 51 or a significant, positive association.46


  Intakes of rTFA and saturated fat will always be highly correlated because the sources
  of rTFA are also important sources of saturated fat.'
- In the present study, the Spearman correlation coefficient between these two intakes
  at baseline screening was 0.86.
- Because of the high correlation, we could not include saturated fat and rTFA intakes
  in the same model, as it would have caused serious colinearity problems, making
  the results impossible to interpret.
- Because we cannot distinguish between the effects of rTFA and saturated fat, it
  is possible that the positive associations observed between rTFA intake and cancer
  risk are caused by saturated fat, and not rTFA.
- We found significant trends for PHVO-TFA intake and risk of CMM and nonmelanoma
  skin cancer, but the results from categorical analyses were not consistent with
  these trend tests.
- Moreover, rTFA intake was significantly inversely associated with CMM risk and positively
  associated with nonmelanoma skin cancer risk.
- However, this cohort is not ideal for studying risk factors for skin cancer, as
  we lack information on ultraviolet exposure, the main risk factor for skin cancer
  and residual confounding may be a problem.52 We are not aware of any other studies
  on skin cancer and TFA intake.
- The mechanisms by which TFA may produce carcinogenic effects are poorly understood.1
  However, TFA intake may promote chronic low-grade inflammation, a risk factor for
  the development of several cancers.4 Positive associations between TFA intake and
  biomarkers of inflammation have been found in both clinical trials53, 54 and observational
  studies.55, 56 Furthermore, fatty acids may exert immunomodulatory effects on immune
  cells.57, 58 A possible link between fatty acids, inflammation and immunity are
  the eicosanoids, which are generated from polyunsaturated fatty acids with 20 carbon
  atoms57 and are involved in both inflammatory and immune responses.
- PHFO contain a complex mixture of modified, very long-chain fatty acids, in addition
  to _trans_ monoenes, _trans_ dienes and _trans_ trienes.59 It is thus likely that
  PHFO-TFA intake results in adversely modified eicosanoids that have adverse effects
  on inflammatory and immune responses.
- This may explain why we observed positive associations between cancer risk and PHFO-TFA
  intake, but not PHVO-TFA intake.
- Strengths of our study include the prospective design, participation rates above
  80%, and practically complete follow-up through linkage with high-quality national
  registries.
- Indeed, reporting of definite malignant neoplasms to the Cancer Registry of Norway
  is required by law, and for the period 2001-2005, the overall completeness of the
  Norwegian Cancer Registry was 98.84%.60 For the sites included in the present report,
  completeness ranges from 93.81% for cancers of the CNS to 99.98% for endometrial
  cancer.60 Even though most of our cases were morphologically verified, we cannot
  rule out the possibility that some cancer cases may have been misclassified.
- The proportion of cases that was verified was somewhat lower for cancers of the
  pancreas and CNS than for the other sites.
- However, limiting the analyses of these cancers to verified cases gave similar results,
  thus misclassification does not seem to have influenced the results.
- Furthermore, the FFQ was designed specifically to measure fat intake in the Norwegian
  diet, and we have accurate information from the margarine industry on the compositions
  of the different types of margarine that were produced at the time the screenings
  took place.
- Intake of industrially produced TFA has decreased substantially in Norway, and because
  we have up to three measurements of intake for each participant, we have been able
  to take at least some of the changes that have occurred into account.
- Although intake was not measured after 1988, it does not seem to have influenced
  the results.
- Indeed, the associations between PHVO-TFA intake and cancer risk did not differ
  by follow-up time (&lt;10 years and â‰¥10 years after last measurement of nutrient
  intake), and for PHFO-TFA intake the associations did not differ for any individual
  cancer site, but did differ for all cancers combined.
- Measurement error in the exposure variables is inevitable in epidemiological studies
  on diet and cancer.
- Intakes of fat and energy measured with the FFQ have been compared to a 24-hr recall
  interview in a sample of participants,11 but a limitation of our study is that this
  was not done for TFA intake.
- Moreover, we have not measured biomarkers of TFA intake.
- Another limitation is that for some sites we have not been able to control for important
  potential confounding variables, _e.g_., alcohol intake for cancer of the mouth
  and pharynx and ultraviolet exposure for CMM and nonmelanoma skin cancer.
- Because we have studied several end points and three different exposures, we have
  performed a large number of statistical tests.
- Even if all our null hypotheses are true, _i.e_., there is no association between
  TFA intake and risk of any cancer, we would expect to wrongly reject the null hypothesis
  for one in twenty tests.
- In conclusion, our results indicate that PHFO-TFA have more adverse effects on cancer
  risk than PHVO-TFA.
- The high correlation between rTFA and saturated fat raises the possibility that
  the increased risk observed for rTFA is linked to saturated fat.
- The authors thank all the participants in the Norwegian Counties Study and the professional
  staff who made this study possible, including the former Norwegian Health Screening
  Service (now part of the Norwegian Institute of Public Health), which initiated
  the Norwegian Counties Study in 1974 and continued data collection throughout the
  following years.
