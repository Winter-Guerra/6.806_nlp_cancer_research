- _Tualang_ honey (TH) is rich in flavonoids and phenolic acids and has significant
  anticancer activity against breast cancer cells comparable to the effect of tamoxifen
  (TAM), _in vitro_.
- The current study evaluated the effects of TH when used in combination with TAM
  on MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells.
- We observed that TH promoted the anticancer activity of TAM in both the estrogen
  receptor-(ER-)responsive and ER-nonresponsive human breast cancer cell lines.
- Flow cytometric analyses indicated accelerated apoptosis especially in MDA-MB-231
  cells and with the involvement of caspase-3/7, -8 and -9 activation as shown by
  fluorescence microscopy.
- Depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane was also increased in both cell lines
  when TH was used in combination with TAM compared to TAM treatment alone.
- TH may therefore be a potential adjuvant to be used with TAM for reducing the dose
  of TAM, hence, reducing TAM-induced adverse effects.
- Chemotherapy is an important component of adjuvant treatment for breast cancer.
- However, the efficacy of chemotherapeutic drugs in cancer treatment is hampered
  by the development of drug resistance in cancer cells, contributed by various factors.
- These include individual metabolic variations, genetic and epigenetic heterogeneity
  in tumor cells, and acquired resistance due to expression of drug transporters which
  limit accumulation of drugs within cells [1].
- Administration of chemotherapeutic drugs to cancer patients also produces undesired
  side effects due to indiscriminate effects on normal and tumor cells in the patient's
  body.
- It is reported that more than 70% of breast cancers are estrogen receptor (ER) positive
  [2, 3].
- Tamoxifen (TAM) is a widely used antiestrogen since 1973 as an adjuvant therapy
  for treatment of early stage, estrogen-sensitive breast cancer [4] and as a chemopreventive
  agent in high risk women [5, 6].
- However, TAM is reported to increase the patients' risk of developing endometrial
  cancer [7] due to genotoxic DNA damage [8].
- TAM-DNA adduct formation has been observed in leukocytes [9] and endometrial samples
  of breast cancer patients [10, 11].
- In addition, growth of some tumours may initially be attenuated by TAM but become
  resistant to continued treatment and continue to grow [12].
- According to the report of Early Breast Cancer Triallists' Collaborative Group [13],
  one-third of breast cancer patients treated with TAM for 5 years will have recurrent
  disease within 15 years.
- The drawbacks of current chemotherapeutic drugs have further promoted the search
  for alternative drugs or adjuvants that confer maximum effect and are less harmful
  for cancer treatment.
- Natural products serve as an important source of therapeutic agents as they may
  contain potential lead compounds that are suitable for drug development.
- Compounds isolated from plants that have their long-term history of human use are
  likely to be safer than those with no prior history [14].
- Examples of natural product-based drugs used as a chemotherapy for breast cancer
  include the microbe-derived anthracycline doxorubicin isolated from _Streptomyces
  peucetius_ [15] and the plant-derived microtubule stabilizing agent, paclitaxel
  [16], which was isolated from the bark of the Pacific yew tree, _Taxus brevifolia_
  [17].
- Unfortunately, cellular resistance also develops with the use of anthracyclines
  and taxanes [18].
- We have previously demonstrated the potential of the Malaysian _Tualang_ honey (TH)
  as an anticancer agent against breast and cervical cancer cells _in vitro_ [19].
- TH was found to cause depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane and induce caspase-dependent
  apoptosis of these cells.
- In this paper we demonstrate the potential of TH in modulating the anticancer activities
  of TAM in ER -dependent MCF-7 and ER -independent MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell
  lines and to further understand the mechanism of the cell death involved.
- All media and supplements for cell culture were purchased from Gibco, Invitrogen
  (USA).
- Tamoxifen citrate was purchased from Sigma (USA).
- 5',6,6'-tetrachloro-1,1',3,3'tetraethylbenzimidazolyl-carbocyanine iodide (JC-1)
  dye was obtained from Invitrogen.
- Annexin V Fluorescence kit was purchased from Roche (Germany).
- Fluorochrome Inhibitor of caspases (FLICA) Apoptosis Detection kits for caspase-3/7
  (FAM-DEVD-FMK), caspase-8 (FAM-VAD-FMK), and caspase-9 (FAM-LEHD-FMK) were purchased
  from ImmunoChemistry Technologies, LLC (USA).
- Human breast adenocarcinoma cell lines, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231, were obtained from
  the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC).
- MCF-7 &amp; MDA-MB-231 cells were propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium
  (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1 unit/mL penicillin/streptomycin.
- The cell lines were maintained at 37°C in 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere.
- For analysis, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded in appropriate culture vessels
  at a density of  cells/mL and allowed to adhere overnight.
- The medium was then replaced with fresh assay medium supplemented with 2 % fetal
  bovine serum containing TH, TAM, or their combination.
- TH (Agromas) which was collected from the hives of the Asian giant bee (_Apis dorsata_)
  on the _Tualang_ tree (_Koompassia excelsa_) in the Malaysian jungle was supplied
  by the Federal Agricultural Marketing Authority (FAMA), Malaysia.
- TH was initially dissolved in serum-free culture medium at a concentration of 10%
  (v/v) and filter sterilized using 0.22 µm syringe filter unit (Millipore, USA).
- The honey mixture was freshly prepared before being added to cell cultures.
- Cells cultured in 25 cm2 flasks were treated with 1% TH or in combination with TAM
  at various concentrations (2.5 µM-15 µM) or TAM alone.
- Cells were harvested at 6, 24, 48, and 72 h after treatment by trypsinization, washed
  with phosphate buffered saline (PBS), and incubated with annexin V fluorescent antibody
  and propidium iodide (PI) for 15 min at room temperature.
- A minimum of 10,000 events were collected and analyzed using flow cytometry (FACSCalibur,
  Beckton Dickinson, USA).
- For evaluation of Δ_ψ__m_, cells were cultured in 6-well plates in fresh assay medium
  containing TH (1%), TAM (5 µM), or TH + TAM for 24 h. Cells were then trypsinized,
  washed with PBS, and incubated with JC-1 dye at a final concentration of 10 µg/mL
  for 15-20 min.
- The cells were then washed with PBS, centrifuged to remove the supernatant, and
  resuspended with fresh medium for flow cytometric analysis.
- JC-1 dye accumulates within intact mitochondria to form multimer J-aggregates (red
  colour) while the colour of the dye changes from red to green in response to reduction
  in the mitochondrial membrane potential.
- The percentage of green fluorescence from JC-1 monomers was measured as mitochondrial
  depolarized (Δ_ψ__m_) cells.
- Cells cultured in 2-well multichamber slides were treated with TH (1%), TAM (5 µM),
  or TH + TAM for 6 h. After treatment, the culture medium was discarded, and the
  cells were washed with PBS followed by incubation with 10 µL of either caspase-3/7
  FLICA, caspase-8 FLICA, or caspase-9 FLICA for 1 h in 300 _μ_L of fresh culture
  medium.
- The green fluorescent labeled FLICA probe binds covalently to the reactive cysteine
  residue on the large subunit of active caspase.
- Cells were also counterstained with Hoechst (blue) dye.
- The fluorescence images were then analysed using the fluorescence microscope (Nikon
  TE2000-U, USA).
- Data were obtained from at least three independent experiments.
- The values were expressed as mean ± standard deviation.
- Statistical evaluations were performed using Mann-Whitney _U_ test, and  was considered
  significant.
- Flow cytometric analyses of cells stained with annexin V fluorescent antibody and
  PI showed that TH significantly increased the percentage of apoptotic cells in both
  the ER -positive and ER -negative breast cancer cells in a time-dependent manner
  compared to the untreated cells (Figures 1(a) and 1(b)).
- Interestingly, the combination of TH and TAM significantly increased the percentage
  of apoptotic cells compared to single treatments.
- In MCF-7 cells, the combination of TH with the lowest concentration of TAM (2.5
  µM) showed significantly higher induction of total apoptosis (42.8%) compared to
  TAM alone (31.2%) after 24 h posttreatment (Figure 1(a)).
- However, the percentages of apoptosis obtained were not significantly different
  from the MCF-7 cells treated with TH alone.
- Similarly, the combined TH and 15 µM TAM resulted in significant increase in apoptotic
  cell death at 24 h (50.2%) and 48 h (72.2%).
- The effect of the combination treatments is more prominent in the ER -negative cells
  with more pronounced increases in apoptotic cell death observed with all four combinations
  compared to TH or TAM treatment alone (Figure 1(b)).
- The increase is mainly attributed to the promotion of late-stage apoptosis in both
  ER -positive and ER -negative cells compared to cells treated with TH or TAM alone
  (Figures 2(a) and 2(b)).
- 'Figure 1: Total apoptosis induced by TH, TAM, and  in MCF-7 (a) and MDA-MB-231
  (b) cells.'
- Cells were treated with TH (1%), TAM (2.5, 5, 10, 15 µM), or their combination for
  up to 72 h. Apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry using annexin-V-Fluos antibody
  and propidium iodide.
- Data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation from three independent experiments.
- significantly different from TH alone.
- significantly different from TAM alone.
- 'Figure 2: Early-and late-stage apoptosis induced by TH, TAM, and  in MCF-7 (a)
  and MDA-MB-231 (b) cells.'
- Cells were treated with TH (1%), TAM (2.5, 5, 10, 15 µM), or their combinations
  for 24 and 48 h. Apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry using annexin-V-Fluos
  antibody and propidium iodide.
- Data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation from three independent experiments.
- significantly different from TH alone.
- significantly different from TAM alone.
- To explore the cell death mechanism involved, changes in the Δ_ψ__m_ were first
  analysed.
- Figure 3(a) shows high levels of green fluorescence staining following treatments
  with TH alone and in combination with 5 µM TAM indicating strong depolarization
  of the mitochondrial membrane of MCF-7 cells with significant difference to TAM
  treatment alone (Figure 3(b)).
- Similarly, TH and TH + TAM produced more reduction in Δ_ψ__m_ in MDA-MB-231 cells
  compared to TAM alone (Figures 4(a) and 4(b)).
- 'Figure 3: Effect of TH, TAM, and TH + TAM on the mitochondrial membrane potential
  of MCF-7 cells.'
- Cells treated with TH alone or in combination with TH (5 _μ_M) for 24 h were stained
  with mitochondrial-selective JC-1 dye and analyzed by flow cytometry.
- (a) The dot plots represent the population of mitochondrial membrane-depolarized
  cells on the lower right (LR) and mitochondrial membrane-polarized cells on the
  upper right (UR).
- (b) Bar graphs represent the percentages of polarized and depolarized cells.
- Data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation from three independent experiments.
- significantly different from untreated control.
- significantly different from TAM alone.
- 'Figure 4: Effect of TH, TAM, and TH + TAM on the mitochondrial membrane potential
  of MDA-MB-231 cells.'
- Cells treated with TH alone or in combination with TH  for 24 h were stained with
  mitochondrial-selective JC-1 dye and analyzed by flow cytometry.
- (a) The dot plots represent the population of mitochondrial membrane-depolarized
  cells on the lower right (LR) and mitochondrial membrane-polarized cells on the
  upper right (UR).
- (b) Bar graphs represen the percentages of polarized and depolarized cells.
- Data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation from three independent experiments.
- significantly different from untreated control.
- Activation of caspase-3/7, -8, and -9 was then determined, in both cells.
- Results indicate that TAM strongly activated caspase-7 but caused no or very minimal
  activation of caspase-8 and-9 in ER -positive MCF-7 cells (Figure 5).
- Activation of all three caspases was induced by TAM in ER -negative MDA-MB-231 cells
  (Figure 6).
- We have previously reported that TH activated caspase-3/7 and -9 in these cells
  [19].
- In the current study, significant activation of these caspases as well as caspase-8
  was observed in both ER -positive and ER -negative cells.
- The combination of TH and TAM produced effects similar to those observed with TH
  alone in both types of cells.
- 'Figure 5: Effect of TH, TAM, and TH + TAM on caspase activation in MCF-7 cells.'
- Treated (6 h) and untreated cells were stained for caspase-3/7 FLICA (FAM-DEVD-FMK),
  caspase-8 FLICA (FAM-LETD-FMK), and caspase-9 FLICA (FAM-LEHD-FMK) which is indicated
  by green fluorescence.
- Cell nuclei are stained blue (Hoechst dye).
- 'Figure 6: Effect of TH, TAM, and TH + TAM on caspase activation in MDA-MB-231 cells.'
- Treated (6 h) and untreated cells were stained for caspase-3/7 FLICA (FAM-DEVD-FMK),
  caspase-8 FLICA (FAM-LETD-FMK), and caspase-9 FLICA (FAM-LEHD-FMK) which is indicated
  by green fluorescence.
- Cell nuclei are stained blue (Hoechst dye).
- Antiproliferative effect of methanolic extracts of the Malaysian TH has been demonstrated
  on keloid fibroblasts, which has been suggested to be due to the presence of fatty
  acids such as palmitic acid, oleic acid, and linoleic acid [20].
- Other studies have also indicated that TH has high antioxidant capacity and free
  radical scavenging activity due to its high content of phenolic compounds, flavonoids,
  and ascorbic acids [21-23].
- We have previously shown that TH induced apoptosis of MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, and HeLa
  cells via a caspase-dependent pathway involving depolarization of the Δ_ψ__m_ [19].
- We further show in this paper that TH is more potent in inducing mitochondrial membrane
  depolarization than TAM.
- Apoptosis is an important mode of action of many anticancer agents including TAM.
- The antiestrogenic effects of TAM are thought to be responsible for its anticancer
  activities.
- This is accomplished via competitive inhibition of estrogen binding to ER, resulting
  in cellular apoptosis [24].
- However, the dosage of TAM needed to induce cytotoxicity and growth inhibition would
  depend on the types of cells studied.
- Petinari et al.
- '[25] showed that various IC50 values (drugs concentration eliciting 50% inhibition)
  of TAM were obtained from different cell lines (e.g., 4.7 µM in PC-3, 12.6 µM in
  MCF-7, and 9.3 µM in HT-29).'
- Low concentrations of TAM (nanomolar) would result in only growth arrest, but induction
  of cell death would be observed at high concentrations (micromolar) [26].
- In this present study, different doses of TAM starting from 2.5 µM to 15 µM were
  tested, and apoptotic cell death induced by TAM was found to be concentration dependent
  in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells.
- The problem of drug resistance, low efficacy, and adverse effects of chemotherapeutic
  agents such as TAM has necessitated studies into the effectiveness of drug combinations
  with the hope of producing more beneficial therapeutic outcomes and overcoming the
  associated problems of single drug treatments [27-29].
- As such, TAM or its active metabolite, 4-hydroxy TAM, has been studied in combination
  with other drugs such as trastuzumab [30], mTOR inhibitor RAD001 [31], troglitazone
  [32], nelfinavir [33], and IGF1R antagonists [34].
- Studies by Yu et al.
- '[32] demonstrated that the combination of troglitazone with TAM led to higher induction
  of growth inhibition in MCF-7 cells compared to either troglitazone or TAM alone.'
- The combination of IGF1R antagonists with TAM also induced high levels of apoptosis
  in BT474 and MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines [34].
- Nelfinavir, an HIV protease inhibitor, displayed antitumoral effects on breast cancer
  cells which were also enhanced by combined treatment with TAM [33].
- There is evidence that the combination of natural products with chemotherapeutic
  agents results in additive or synergistic effects on cancer cells.
- Wang et al.
- '[35] reported on the synergistic effect of gambogic acid (from _Garcinia hanburyi_
  tree in Southeast Asia) and 5-fluororacil in inhibiting proliferation and inducing
  apoptosis of the gastric carcinoma cell line, BGC-823.'
- Recently, the synergistic activity of a Chinese herbal product, Celastrol, with
  trastuzumab or lapatinib in inhibiting the growth of Erb2-overexpressing human breast
  cancer cells in a mouse xenograft model was reported [36].
- In the current study, we observed that combination treatments of TH and TAM at concentrations
  of 2.5 µM-10 µM conferred a good apoptotic effect with minimal necrosis (&lt;8%).
- Potentiation of the anticancer effects of TAM by TH was observed in both ER -positive
  MCF-7 cells and ER -negative MDA-MB-231 cells which were reflected mainly by the
  increase in total and late-stage cellular apoptosis.
- Similarly, a previous study demonstrated that the combination of TAM and green tea
  extract produced a synergistic inhibition of cellular proliferation of ER-positive
  breast cancer cells including MCF-7 [37].
- Green tea was proven to inhibit breast cancer growth by direct antiproliferative
  effect on the tumor cells as well as by indirect suppressive effects on the tumor-associated
  endothelial cells.
- Reduction of Δ_ψ__m_ is identified as an early event in the apoptosis pathway [38].
- Proapoptotic proteins from the mitochondrial intermembrane space are released following
  the opening of the permeability transition pore leading to apoptotic cell death.
- Induction of mitochondrial membrane permeabilization by therapeutic drugs can restore
  apoptosis in cancer cells [39].
- Lobaton and collegues [40] reported that 10 µM TAM inhibited mitochondrial Ca2+
  uptake in HeLa cells without significant changes in the Δ_ψ__m_.
- In contrast, our findings showed that treatment of 5 µM TAM alone or in combination
  with TH in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 caused a significant reduction in the Δ_ψ__m_
  compared to untreated cells.
- As previously reported [19], TH itself potently depolarized the mitochondrial membrane.
- This is in agreement with the reported loss of mitochondrial membrane potential
  following treatment of colon cancer cells with an Indian honey [41].
- Although mitochondrial membrane depolarization was higher with TH + TAM compared
  to the effect of the antiestrogen alone, this seems to be attributed to the potent
  effect of TH itself.
- Proteins released following mitochondrial membrane depolarization include cytochrome
  c which subsequently activates caspases leading to rapid loss of mitochondrial functions
  in apototic cell death, but cell death can also occur independent of caspases [39].
- We further found that TH activated initiator caspases-8 and -9 with subsequent activation
  of executioner caspase-3 or -7 in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells.
- The results therefore indicate the involvement of both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways
  of apoptosis.
- This mechanism also holds true for the combination effect of TH with TAM.
- In the instrinsic (classic) apoptotic pathway, cytosolic cytochrome c will bind
  with procaspase-9 and Apaf-1 to form a complex known as apoptosome, which triggers
  the cleavage of procaspase-9 to an active caspase-9, the initiator caspase in mitochondrial
  apoptosis [42, 43].
- Caspase-8 is activated via the extrinsic pathway, and it causes truncation of the
  proapoptotic protein, BID, to form tBID which induces mitochondrial membrane permeabilization,
  allowing the release of cytochrome c [43].
- Activation of caspase-9 or caspase-8 results in activation of downstream executioner
  caspases, such as caspase-3.
- Recently, the effect of TAM on another ER-positive breast cancer cells, T47D, was
  found to be potentiated by the presence of a substituted quinoline which acts as
  a gap junctional activator [44].
- The authors demonstrated that the combination treatment increased the number of
  apoptotic cells, BAX expression, DNA fragmentation, and caspase-3 activation compared
  with individual treatments.
- To our knowledge, this is the first study that provides evidence of modulation of
  TAM activity by honey and that the combination of TH and TAM is more potent than
  either agent alone in inhibiting cell growth of both ER -positive and ER -negative
  breast cancer cells via direct induction of caspase-dependent apoptosis.
- Potentiation of TAM effect by TH may reduce the required effective dose of TAM with
  a resultant reduction in adverse effects of TAM.
- This would be an interesting research to further support the medicinal value of
  honey.
- The current findings offer a new approach in designing future preclinical and human
  trials againts breast cancer.
