- The concentrations of Cd, Cu and Zn in both the whole soft tissue and separate organs
  (gills, mantle, muscle and digestive gland) of wild bivalves (_Mytilus galloprovincialis_,
  _Pinctada radiata_, _Venus verrucosa_ and _Callista chione_) from three different
  coastal microenvironments of Greece were monitored from 2003 to 2004.
- In parallel, by employing appropriate analytical protocols for metal partitioning,
  the labile fraction of the metals was determined in the dissolved phase, suspended
  particulate matter and sediments.
- Differences in the metal levels were detected both among the study areas as well
  as among the bivalves examined.
- Significant bioaccumulation was demonstrated regarding Zn in _M.
- galloprovincialis_ specimens from the highly industrialized Gulf of Elefsis and
  Cd in _P.
- radiata_ and _V.
- verrucosa_ from the Maliakos Gulf, which is influenced by extended agricultural
  activity occurring at the neighbouring area and a river outflow.
- Data of the metal levels in the various environmental phases were correlated with
  their concentrations in bivalves’ tissues.
- The clear relationships obtained in many cases among the labile metal concentrations
  and the bioaccumulated concentrations in bivalves point out that the labile fraction
  of a metal is the most bioavailable.
- The lack of positive correlation for _C.
- chione_ confirms the occurrence of effective mechanisms of internal regulation of
  metal concentrations.
- Although their impact has no visible influence compared to other pollutants, heavy
  metals can cause long-term effects on ecosystems (Kucuksezgin et al.
- 2010).
- The usefulness of bivalves as sentinel organisms in metal biomonitoring studies
  is widely recognized (e.g.
- Goldberg et al.
- 1983; Luten et al.
- 1986; De Kock and Kramer 1994) as it is well known that they can accumulate ambient
  metals from the dissolved phase, their food and the ingestion of inorganic particulate
  material (Phillips 1976; Struck et al.
- 1997).
- In biomonitoring programmes, the primary objective is to relate the metal body contents
  of bivalves to the bioavailable levels found in the surrounding environment.
- Despite the numerous studies on bivalves, quantitative extrapolation of environmental
  exposures from body metal concentrations or vice versa still remains with lots of
  uncertainty (Rainbow 2002).
- This is mainly due to several biological (body size, sex, reproductive status, physiological
  condition) and environmental factors (salinity, season, organic matter and tidal
  height) that influence the accumulation and concentrations of metals in bivalves’
  tissues.
- Spatial heterogeneity with regard to the hydrogeochemical conditions and ecological
  factors precludes the generalization of metal uptake by organisms inhabiting even
  the neighbouring sites, permitting only few generalizations related to the studied
  element, the overall pollution of the location and the season (Riget et al.
- 1996; Wang and Fisher 1999; Rainbow 2002).
- Although the total trace metal concentrations in the dissolved phase, the suspended
  particulate phase and the sediments provide a convenient measure of metal pollution,
  such measures do not necessarily predict the toxicity of these pollutants to aquatic
  animals (Luoma 1989, 1995; Di Toro et al.
- 1990).
- Within each phase, the organism is exposed to a variety of the physicochemical forms
  of each metal differing in their accessibility to the organism (Luoma 1983).
- Predicting the bioavailability of dissolved metals as a function of their speciation
  in the environment still remains an important goal in aquatic ecotoxicology (Chen
  et al.
- 2010).
- A key role is maintained by sediments which act as scavenging agents and an adsorptive
  sink for metals in aquatic environments.
- Bivalves exist either in direct contact with sediments or on rocks, exposed to fine
  sediments resuspended by wave action (Giarratano and Amin 2010).
- The accumulation of metals in specific organs of marine bivalves has been proposed
  as a sensitive and specific indicator of environmental contamination (Kavun and
  Podgurskaya 2009).
- The metal concentrations in specific organs of marine bivalves related to environmental
  exposure have only been examined in a few cases and rarely in native populations
  (Tarique et al.
- 2012).
- Hence, the aim of this paper was the simultaneous study of Cd, Cu and Zn concentrations
  in the tissues of four bivalves and of the partitioning of these metals in the dissolved
  phase, suspended particulate matter (SPM) and sediments in order to seek out main
  patterns from the overall data set and specifically evaluate which species exhibits
  an association with environmental exposure.
- The metal content was measured in both the whole soft tissue and separate organs
  (gills, mantle, muscle and digestive gland) of wild specimens of the mussel _Mytilus
  galloprovincialis_, the oyster _Pinctada radiata_ and the clams _Venus verrucosa_
  and _Callista chione_, for the latest of which no data were found in the literature.
- The bivalves selected are among the most commonly marketed and frequently consumed
  in Greece and other Mediterranean countries.
- The work was carried out in three Mediterranean coastal systems constituting different
  typical microenvironments.
- 'Specimens of the bivalves studied were obtained from five coastal sites located
  in three semi-enclosed gulfs of the Aegean Sea, selected to represent different
  physicochemical and geomorphological features and degrees of pollution: (1) The
  Gulf of Elefsis, which is an almost enclosed ‘polluted’ area near Athens receiving
  industrial, commercial, transport and urban inputs.'
- Two stations were sampled therein at the Loutropyrgos and Blue lagoon sites.
- These sites still sustain rich biodiversity and were selected to be far from direct
  discharges.
- (2) The Evoikos Gulf, which is an embayment influenced by strong tidal currents,
  a rare phenomenon in the Mediterranean.
- The two stations selected (Kalamos and Artaki sites) are affected by the overall
  industrialization and urbanization of the northern (Artaki) and the southern (Kalamos)
  sections of the gulf.
- (3) The Maliakos Gulf (Molos site), which is an area receiving the runoff of an
  influenced agricultural area and the outflow of river Sperchios (Fig.
- 1).
- Among the studied bivalves, specimens of _M.
- galloprovincialis_ were not found at N. Artaki, of _P.
- radiata_ at the Kalamos and Nea Artaki sites, of _V.
- verrucosa_ at Blue lagoon and Kalamos, and of _C.
- chione_ at the Blue lagoon and Molos sites.
- Bivalves and seawater samplings were performed by scuba diving in a total of four
  consecutive samplings (July 2003 and 2004, January 2004 and 2005).
- Sediment samples were collected in two samplings carried out in the winter and summer
  of 2004.
- Seawater and sediment samplings are described in detail by Scoullos et al.
- (2006) and Sakellari et al.
- (2011), respectively.
- The bivalves (50 specimens per site and sampling for mussels and oysters and 25
  for clams), with the size of mussels and clams being approximately 5 cm and that
  of oysters approximately 7 cm, were immediately transferred to the laboratory in
  plastic containers within a portable refrigerator.
- The bivalves were kept for 24 h in seawater taken from the same area in order to
  eliminate pseudofaeces (Besada et al.
- 2002).
- Soft tissues of five individuals of each species (giving ten replicates for mussels
  and oysters and five replicates for clams) were dissected, pooled, lyophilized,
  homogenized and stored in acid-washed glass vials at room temperature inside a desiccator
  until analysis.
- The length of each bivalve shell was measured to the nearest millimetre with Vernier
  calipers.
- The shells were dried for 48 h until constant weight was reached.
- Flesh condition index was calculated according to Lobel and Wright (1982) as the
  dry flesh weight (in milligrams)/dry shell weight (in milligrams).
- For the determination of metals in four separate vital organs (gills, mantle, muscle
  and digestive gland), 20 specimens per site and sampling were collected, with the
  size of mussels and clams being approximately 5 cm and that of oysters approximately
  7 cm.
- Dissection was performed directly after sampling in order to avoid redistribution
  of the metal content among individual organs.
- Pooled samples of soft tissues consisting of five individuals of each species (giving
  four replicates) were treated as mentioned above.
- Approximately 0.5 g of the dry sample accurately weighed was placed in Teflon holders
  especially designed for airtight sealing.
- A volume of 8–10 mL of nitric acid 65 % supra pure (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) was
  added and the samples digested overnight on a hot plate at 120 °C and diluted with
  water of 18.2 MΩ cm (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA) to a final volume of 25 mL.
- Determinations of the concentrations of both Cd and Cu were carried out using graphite
  furnace atomic absorption spectrometry (GFAAS) with Zeeman background correction
  (SpectrAA 640Z, Varian, Mulgrave, Victoria, Australia).
- Solutions of ammonium dihydrogen phosphate (H2NH4PO4, 0.4 %, _w_/_v_; Merck) and
  magnesium nitrate (Mg(NO3)2⋅6H2O, 0.02 %, _w_/_v_; Merck) were used as matrix modifiers
  for cadmium, whereas palladium nitrate (Pd(NO3)2, 0.03 %, _w_/_v_; Merck) and magnesium
  nitrate (Mg(NO3)2⋅6H2O, 0.02 %, _w_/_v_) were used for copper.
- 'The furnace operating conditions [temperature (in degree Celsius)/ramp time (in
  seconds)/hold time (in seconds)] employed were: for cadmium determinations—drying:
  85 °C/5 s/0 s, 110 °C/10 s/30 s, 130 °C/5 s/5 s; pyrolysis: 900 °C/5 s/7 s; atomization:
  1,800 °C/0.8 s/4 s; cleaning: 2,200 °C/2 s/2 s; for copper determinations—drying:
  85 °C/5 s/0 s, 95 °C/40 s/0 s, 120 °C/10 s/0 s; pyrolysis: 800 °C/5 s/6 s; atomization:
  2,300 °C/1.1 s/2.1 s; cleaning: 2,600 °C/1 s/4 s. Zn determinations were performed
  using flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS; SpectrAA 200, Varian).'
- Quality control measures included the use of laboratory reagent blanks, sample duplicates
  and the certified reference material BCR No.
- 278R (mussel tissue), which was analysed for the evaluation of measurement accuracies
  (certified value/value detected/%recovery/%RSD), which were 348 ± 7/347 ± 14/99.7/4.0
  for Cd (in nanograms per gram), 9.45 ± 0.13/9.43 ± 0.28/99.8/3.0 for Cu (in micrograms
  per gram) and 83.1 ± 1.7/83.9 ± 2.6/101/3.1 for Zn (in micrograms per gram).
- For every batch of ten samples, a reagent blank and a certified reference material
  sample were run.
- In case metal concentrations in the reagent blank were detectable, the procedure
  for the whole batch was repeated.
- The calculation of the method limits of detection (MLD) was made by multiplying
  the standard deviation of seven replicate spikes, prepared at an appropriate low
  concentration, by 3.14 (US EPA 1997).
- The MLD values obtained were 2.6 ng/g for Cd, 0.1 μg/g for Cu and 1 μg/g for Zn.
- Total dissolved metals were determined using the solvent extraction technique described
  by Danielsson et al.
- (1982), whereas the diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT) labile metals were measured
  in situ using the DGT assemblies proposed by Davison and Zhang (1994).
- Cd and Cu concentrations were determined using GFAAS and Zn using FAAS.
- Total metal concentrations in SPM were determined following filtration of 4 L of
  seawater through previously weighed 0.45-μm filters of nitric cellulose (Millipore)
  and further digestion of the filters with the addition of HNO3 65 % supra pure,
  6 N HCl (Merck) and HF 38–40 % (Merck); heating for 6 h at 100 °C; and dilution
  to a final volume of 25 mL (Wen et al.
- 1997).
- The metal concentrations in the solutions obtained were determined using AAS as
  described above.
- In order to characterize the solid-state fractionation of trace metals in SPM among
  a number of operationally defined host fractions, the dry filters containing particulate
  material (another 4 L of seawater was filtrated as described previously) were leached
  or digested using a three-step procedure proposed by Lewis and Landing (1992), slightly
  modified by Wen et al.
- (1997).
- 'Leaching agents included: (a) 4.5 N CH3COOH (for weakly adsorbed trace metals and
  carbonates); (b) 2 N HCl and 1 N HNO3 (for trace metals associated with organics,
  iron–manganese oxyhydroxides and some sulphidic phases, such as FeS); and (c) HNO3
  65 %, 6 N HCl and HF 38–40 % (for trace metals associated with refractory phases
  such as silicates and FeS2).'
- The metal concentrations in particulate matter leachates were determined using AAS
  as described above.
- Determination of the total metal content and of the weakly bound fraction of the
  sediments extracted with HCl 0.5 N is described analytically by Sakellari et al.
- (2011).
- Cd concentrations were measured using GFAAS, and Cu and Zn using FAAS.
- The metal/shell weight index (micrograms of metal per gram dry shell weight or the
  metal content per unit of shell weight) was calculated according to Fischer (1984).
- According to Soto et al.
- (1995), the metal/shell weight index provides a reliable tool for the assessment
  of metal bioavailability to sentinel mollusks in coastal waters.
- It is useful in eliminating part of the variability due to the inherent biology
  of sentinel mussels (Bartolomé et al.
- 2010).
- The statistical techniques used were one-way/two-way factorial ANOVA and Pearson’s
  correlation test.
- Statistical analyses were performed using the software package PASW Statistics (SPSS)
  18.0.
- A value of _p_ &lt; 0.05 (95 % confidence level) was considered to indicate a significant
  difference (ANOVA) or a significant correlation (Pearson’s correlation coefficient,
  _r_) in the statistical analysis of the data.
- The concentrations of metals in the dissolved phase, the suspended particulate matter
  and the sediments are presented in Table 1.
- The labile forms of metals in the various phases are of particular importance, as
  being more bioavailable.
- Dissolved Zn was determined to be DGT labile to a great extent since its mean DGT
  labile fraction was found to represent 83–94 % of its mean total dissolved concentration,
  whereas in the cases of Cd and Cu, the corresponding percentages were determined
  to vary from 34 to 52 % and from 24 to 38 %, respectively.
- Many researchers have shown that in marine systems, dissolved Cu is almost fully
  complexed by organic ligands, followed by Cd and Zn which demonstrate more labile
  behaviour considering their complexation with organic ligands (Donat and Bruland
  1990; Kozelka and Bruland 1998; Ellwood and van den Berg 2000; Eriksen et al.
- 2001; Cobelo-Garcia and Prego 2004).
- It is now widely recognized that organic complexation decreases the toxicity of
  the metal (Moffett and Brand 1996; Gledhill et al.
- 1999) by reducing the levels of free ions.
- The high percentage of Cu complexation with organic matter in seawater is attributed
  to its biogenic character since it is a required constituent in many enzyme systems,
  the most notable of which are the enzyme of cytochrome oxidase and the electron
  carrier plastocyanin (Coale and Bruland 1988; Yang and van den Berg 2009).
- "Mean metal concentrations and standard deviations in the dissolved phase (DGT labile
  and total), SPM and sediments (weakly bound and total, mean concentrations of the
  upper 8 cm of sediment cores in the silt and clay fractions)  \n\n\nMean metal concentrations:
  four samplings for the dissolved phase and SPM; two samplings for sediments\n\n\n\nIn
  the Elefsis Gulf, the highest DGT labile and total dissolved Cu and Zn concentrations
  were detected and, at Molos, the highest concentration of DGT labile Cd, showing
  a statistically significant difference from the rest of the areas studied."
- The highest concentrations of all the metals studied in the total SPM were detected
  at Molos site (Table 1), attributed to the particularly fine-grained sediment of
  the specific site and its resuspension to overlying seawater.
- Regarding metal fractionation in SPM, the distributions of Cd, Cu and Zn in the
  three fractions examined demonstrate relatively small differences, excluding the
  Molos site (Fig.
- 2).
- Cd is found mainly in the first fraction of the leaching procedure, which is the
  most labile, obtained with 4.5 N CH3COOH, with its concentration varying from 54
  to 73 % of the total SPM metal (Fig.
- 2).
- The corresponding values of the first fraction for Cu and Zn range between 30 and
  68 % and between 42 and 91 %, respectively.
- On the contrary, at the Molos area, the more inert forms of both Cu and Zn (fractions
  obtained at the second and third steps of the leaching procedure) seem to prevail
  (Fig.
- 2).
- The highest mean concentration of total metals in sediment was recorded at the Loutropyrgos
  site, with the single exception of Cu, the highest concentration of which was determined
  at the Molos area (Table 1).
- The variation of the mean total metal concentrations in sediment greatly follows
  the same pattern as the weakly bound fraction of metals, obtained by extraction
  with 0.5 N HCl.
- Considering metal lability in sediment, the highest values of the weakly bound fraction
  of Zn are determined in the silt and clay fractions of sediments from the Loutropyrgos
  site (representing 85 % of the total metal; Table 1), whereas for the rest of the
  locations investigated, the corresponding values range from 24 to 57 %.
- The study of metals in different environmental phases points out that in all cases
  examined, Zn appears to be more labile compared to Cd and Cu.
- Examination of the relationship among the metal concentrations in the dissolved
  phase, the suspended particulate matter and the sediments indicates a positive correlation
  of DGT labile Cu with the total dissolved Cu (_r_ = 0.88, _n_ = 20).
- Regarding Zn, a positive correlation was found between DGT labile Zn and both total
  dissolved Zn (_r_ = 1.00, _n_ = 20) and weakly bound Zn in the sediment (_r_ = 0.88,
  _n_ = 10).
- For both total dissolved Cu and Zn, there is a correlation with the weakly bound
  Cu and Zn in sediments (_r_ = 0.86 and 0.62, respectively, _n_ = 10).
- No significant correlation was shown for Cd in the various phases.
- Of particular interest is the correlation of Zn between the dissolved phase and
  its labile fraction in the sediment, which seems to be independent of SPM.
- The range of metal concentrations measured in the whole soft tissues of the bivalves
  examined demonstrated that all the samples analysed were enriched with heavy metals
  at different levels.
- The metal concentrations (in micrograms per gram dry weight, min value/max value/mean
  value) in _M.
- galloprovincialis_ were determined as equal to 0.262/5.43/1.03 for Cd, 0.9/11/3.7
  for Cu and 33/804/173 for Zn; in _P.
- radiata_ as equal to 1.41/17.7/6.46 for Cd, 2.8/18/6.3 for Cu and 1930/13716/4687
  for Zn; in _V.
- verrucosa_ as equal to 0.330/11.2/2.26 for Cd, 3.4/29/11 for Cu and 49/180/84 for
  Zn; and in _C.
- chione_ as equal to 0.120/3.78/0.486 for Cd, 3.0/22/8.3 for Cu and 38/67/50 for
  Zn.
- 'According to the US National Status and Trends ‘Mussel Watch’ Program (US National
  Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA) following two decades of pollution
  monitoring in the US coastal zone, in order to assess the different degrees of pollution,
  three levels of concentration ranges of contaminants were assigned in milligrams
  per kilogram dry weight of mussel: low/medium/high (Cd, 0–3/4–9/10–20; Cu, 5–16/17–39/40–857;
  Zn, 48–139/140–320/321–11,500; Kimbrough et al.'
- 2008).
- Based on the aforementioned levels of concentration ranges, the Elefsis Gulf appears
  particularly enriched in zinc since 11 mussel samples from the area of Loutropyrgos
  and 13 from the Blue lagoon were found in the class of high concentrations regarding
  Zn, whereas regarding Cd and Cu, all of the samples at all sampling stations are
  found in the class of low metal concentrations.
- The significantly higher Cd, Cu and Zn levels detected in oysters in comparison
  to mussels (_p_ &lt; 0.001), also recorded by other researchers (Franco et al.
- 2002; Shulkin et al.
- 2003), reflect their widely differentiated ability to accumulate metals (O’Connor
  1994).
- Metal/shell weight indices were used to characterize each site and season depending
  on metal bioavailability.
- It is evident that the bioaccumulated Zn in _M.
- galloprovincialis_ specimens from the Gulf of Elefsis (Loutropyrgos, Blue lagoon,
  _p_ &lt; 0.001) and Cd in _P.
- radiata_ and _V.
- verrucosa_ species from the Maliakos Gulf (Molos, _p_ &lt; 0.001 in the two bivalves),
  during both winter and summer, demonstrated the highest values among the total samples
  analysed (Fig.
- 3).
- 'Mean metal/shell weight indices (micrograms of metal per gram dry shell weight)
  of bivalves (_bars_ represent the standard deviation; _n_ = 20 for mussels and oysters,
  _n_ = 10 for clams)


  According to Soto et al.'
- (1995), the metal/shell weight index does not exhibit seasonal fluctuations in non-polluted
  sites, as could be expected by the absence of local inputs.
- On the contrary, at a polluted site, the metal/shell weight index changed seasonally
  in relation to the intensity of the industrial activity, indicating fluctuations
  in the metal bioavailability.
- Consequently, the metal/shell weight indices provide a method to detect differences
  and changes in the overall availability of cumulative metals, as Fischer (1988)
  concluded from laboratory studies and Regoli and Orlando (1993) as applied to the
  particular case of Pb-exposed mussels.
- Data of the present study showed higher mean Cd, Cu and Zn/shell weight indices
  in mussels in winter in comparison to summer (excluding the area of Molos, _p_ Cd/Cu/Zn
  &lt; 0.001/&lt;0.001/0.005).
- In oysters, higher mean Cd/shell weight indices were found in summer in all the
  examined areas (_p_ &lt; 0.001), whereas no significant seasonal variation was observed
  regarding Cu and Zn (_p_ Cu/Zn = 0.153/0.051).
- Concerning _V.
- verrucosa_ and _C.
- chione_ species, no specific seasonal trends were recorded (Fig.
- 3).
- In oysters, the tendency characterizing Cd is different from that shown by the rest
  of the bivalves examined in the present study.
- This might be related to biological factors such as the increment of the feed rate
  of oysters due to the elevation of seawater temperature (Riedel et al.
- 1998).
- Another factor which may possibly contribute to the increased values of metal/shell
  weight indices obtained during winter is the intense stratification observed, particularly
  in the Elefsis Gulf, during summer, followed by an abrupt vertical mixing of seawater
  layers towards the end of summer/autumn and the subsequent homogenization of the
  water column during winter (Scoullos 1979).
- The area under the thermocline, where particles are scavenged during the summer
  period and hypoxic or anoxic conditions prevail, constitutes a secondary metal source
  through the remobilization of metals due to a series of complex mechanisms (Cotté-Krief
  et al.
- 2002).
- The metal/shell weight indices of the bivalves examined were found to correlate
  with the metal concentrations in the dissolved phase, the suspended particulate
  matter and the sediment (Table 2).
- Regarding the mussel _M.
- galloprovincialis_, its Zn/shell weight indices are associated with Zn concentrations
  in the dissolved phase and in the weakly bound fraction of sediment (Table 2).
- Since mussels live at some, even small, distance from the sea bottom, the impact
  of sediment to dissolved Zn levels seems indirect, through an intense resupply of
  zinc in pore water from sediment at the Loutropyrgos area, correlating with the
  highest value of the weakly bound fraction of Zn at this area, as shown by Sakellari
  et al.
- (2011).
- The comparatively high Zn concentrations measured in the pore waters (394 nM) exceed
  considerably those in the overlying seawater, resulting in the formation of a strong
  concentration gradient in the sediment–water interface, and the potential Zn flux
  at the sediment–water interface at Loutropyrgos was calculated as 0.8 mmol m−2 day−1
  (Sakellari et al.
- 2011).
- The correlation found between Zn/shell weight indices of _M.
- galloprovincialis_ and the Zn concentrations in the dissolved phase is in accordance
  with Chong and Wang (2001) who have observed that mussels uptake from the dissolved
  phase constitutes the determining factor in total Zn accumulation, whereas Fisher
  et al.
- (1996) and Wang and Fisher (1999) demonstrated that the uptake from the dissolved
  phase is important for metals such as Zn, which tend to be transported through a
  relatively simple procedure (e.g.
- following binding to a ligand prior to intracellular transport).
- "Pearson correlation coefficients (_p_ &lt; 0.05) between metal levels in the dissolved
  phase (DGT labile and total: MedissDGT, MedissTotal); in suspended particulate matter
  (MeSPM) in sediments (weakly bound and total: MeSEDHCl, MeSEDTotal); and metal/shell
  weight indices in the bivalves studied  \n\n\n\n\nIn the oyster _P."
- radiatα_, Zn was shown to correlate with the total quantity of Zn in the sediment.
- Cu correlated with its weakly bound fraction in sediment and Cd with DGT labile
  Cd and its quantity in total SPM (Table 2).
- The correlation found among all metals in the oyster _P.
- radiata_ with their concentrations in suspended particulate matter, which notably
  are not particularly low, is in accordance with Ke and Wang (2001) who suggest that
  dissolved uptake contributes significantly to metal accumulation only when the metal
  concentration factor (CF) in the particles is in the lower end of the range typically
  found in nature; otherwise, sediments become a significant source of metals.
- Sensitivity analysis indicates that the metal CF is a critical parameter in determining
  the exposure pathways of metals in oysters.
- The intense correlation of Zn and Cu/shell weight indices in _V.
- verrucosa_ species with their corresponding concentrations in the weakly bound fraction
  of sediment (Table 2) confirms the impact of sediment to the specific organism living
  within the sediment, under the sea bottom surface, since in its filter-feeding mode
  it is exposed to the dissolved metals of its burrow water, which is a mixture of
  hypoxic/anoxic pore water and overlying (oxygenated) water (Griscom and Fisher 2002).
- No significant correlations were observed for any of the studied metals in the case
  of _C.
- chione_.
- In Fig.
- 4, the concentrations of Cd, Cu and Zn distributed among the different organs of
  the organisms studied are presented.
- In _M.
- galloprovincialis_, the highest Zn concentrations were detected in gills (_p_ &lt;
  0.001), whereas Cd and Cu accumulated at similar levels in both the gills and the
  digestive gland of mussels and at higher levels compared to muscle and mantle (_p_
  &lt; 0.001).
- According to Dimitriadis et al.
- (2003), gills and the digestive gland constitute mussels’ most important target
  organs.
- In the case of _P.
- radiate_, Cu and Zn are mainly accumulated in the digestive gland (_p_ &lt; 0.001)
  whilst Cd in the muscle tissue (_p_ &lt; 0.001).
- The gills of _V.
- verrucosa_ specimens demonstrated significantly higher Cd concentrations in comparison
  to the rest of the soft tissues examined (_p_ &lt; 0.001), whereas significantly
  higher values of Cu and Zn were found in its digestive gland and mantle compared
  to gills and muscle, respectively (_p_ &lt; 0.001).
- Romeo and Gnassia-Barelli (1988) support that the high Cd content of _V.
- verrucosa_ compared to other species appears to be of natural origin.
- Regarding metal distribution among the soft tissues of _C.
- chione_ specimens examined, the highest concentrations of Cd and Cu were detected
  in the gills and the digestive gland respectively, whilst Zn was almost evenly distributed
  among the gills, digestive gland and muscle.
- This pattern of Zn in _C.
- chione_ species, which differs from the rest of the bivalves examined, constitutes
  an indication of an effective regulation of Zn concentrations within this organism.
- 'Mean metal concentrations (micrograms of metal per gram dry weight; _bars_ represent
  the standard deviation; _n_ = 16) among the different tissues of bivalves




  The highest concentrations of Zn and Cu in the dissolved phase and sediments were
  determined in the Gulf of Elefsis, whereas those of all metals in SPM were at the
  area of Molos.'
- Among the examined metals, Zn was more DGT labile in the dissolved phase (83–94
  %), followed by Cd (34–52 %) and Cu (24–38 %).
- A significant percentage (85 %) of the weakly bound Zn in sediment was detected
  at the Loutropyrgos site, where an important flux of Zn in the sediment–water interface
  occurs.
- In mussels, a correlation of Zn/shell weight indices to the concentrations of dissolved
  Zn and the weakly bound Zn in sediments was shown.
- The highest values of bioaccumulated Zn determined at Loutropyrgos in comparison
  to the rest of the study areas, in combination with the highest Zn concentrations
  detected in mussel gills, enhance the view that at the specific area, Zn uptake
  by mussels is significantly affected by the continuous supply in Zn of overlying
  water by sediment.
- In _P.
- radiata_ and _V.
- verrucosa_, the high values of Cd/shell weight indices are correlated with the high
  concentrations of DGT labile Cd in the dissolved phase and Cd in the total SPM.
- These findings, combined with Cd accumulation mainly in the muscle tissue of _P.
- radiata_ and in the gills of _V.
- verrucosa_, demonstrate the difference in Cd bioaccumulation mechanisms between
  these species.
- The lack of positive correlation for _C.
- chione_ confirms the occurrence of effective mechanisms of internal regulation of
  metal concentrations; consequently, this bivalve is not appropriate to be used as
  a bioindicator of the examined metals.
