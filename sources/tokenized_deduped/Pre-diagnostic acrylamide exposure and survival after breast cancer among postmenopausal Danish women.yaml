- Acrylamide is a probable human carcinogen, with industrial contact, tobacco smoking
  and foods processed at high temperatures as the main routes of exposure.
- In animal studies oral intake of acrylamide has been related to cancer development,
  with indications that the increased cancer occurrence especially regards endocrine
  related tumors.
- In human epidemiological studies, dietary exposure to acrylamide has also been suggested
  related to higher risk of endocrine related tumors, like estrogen sensitive breast
  cancer.
- The aim of the present study was to evaluate if pre-diagnostic acrylamide exposure,
  measured by acrylamide and glycidamide hemoglobin adducts (AA-Hb and GA-Hb), were
  associated to mortality in breast cancer cases.
- Among 24,697 postmenopausal women included into a Danish cohort between 1993 and
  1997, 420 developed breast cancer before 2001 and 110 died before 2009.
- AA-Hb and GA-Hb concentrations measured in blood samples were related to mortality
  by Cox proportional hazard models.
- Estimates are given per 25 pmol/g globin higher levels.
