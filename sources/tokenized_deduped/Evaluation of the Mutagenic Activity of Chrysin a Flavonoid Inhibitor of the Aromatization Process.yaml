- Chrysin is one of the natural flavonoids present in plants, and large amounts are
  present in honey and propolis.
- In addition to anticancer, antioxidation, and anti-inflammatory activities, chrysin
  has also been reported to be an inhibitor of aromatase, an enzyme converting testosterone
  into estrogen.
- The present study evaluated the mutagenicity of this flavonoid using micronucleus
  (MN) with HepG2 cells and _Salmonella_.
- Cell survival after exposure to different concentrations of chrysin was also determined
  using sulforhodamine B (SRB) colorimetric assay in HepG2 cells and the influence
  of this flavonoid on growth of cells in relation to the cell cycle and apoptosis.
- The MN test showed that from 1 to 15 μ_M_ of this flavonoid mutagenic activity was
  noted in HepG2 cells.
- The _Salmonella_ assay demonstrated a positive response to the TA100 _Salmonella_
  strain in the presence or absence of S9, suggesting that this compound acted on
  DNA, inducing base pair substitution before or after metabolism via cytochrome P-450.
- The SRB assay illustrated that chrysin promoted growth inhibition of HepG2 cells
  in both periods studied (24 and 48 h).
- After 24 h of exposure it was noted that the most significant results were obtained
  with a concentration of 50 μ_M_, resulting in 83% inhibition and SubG0 percentage
  of 12%.
- After 48 h of incubation cell proliferation inhibition rates (97% at 50 μ_M_) were
  significantly higher.
- Our results showed that chrysin is a mutagenic and cytotoxic compound in cultured
  human HepG2 cells and _Salmonella typhimurium_.
- Although it is widely accepted that flavonoids are substances beneficial to health,
  one must evaluate the risk versus benefit relationship and concentrations of these
  substances to which an individual may be exposed.
