- Mammographic density is one of the strongest predictors of breast cancer risk.
- Recently, it has been suggested that reactive oxygen species may influence breast
  cancer risk through its influence on mammographic density.
- In the current study, we addressed this hypothesis and also assessed if the association
  between carotenoids and breast cancer risk varies by mammographic density.
- We conducted a nested case-control study consisting of 604 breast cancer cases and
  626 controls with prospectively measured circulating carotenoid levels and mammographic
  density in the Nurses' Health Study.
- Circulating levels of α-carotene, β-carotene, β-cryptoxanthin, lycopene, and lutein/zeaxanthin
  were measured.
- We used a computer-assisted thresholding method to measure percent mammographic
  density.
- We found no evidence that circulating carotenoids are inversely associated with
  mammographic density.
- However, mammographic density significantly modified the association between total
  circulating carotenoids and breast cancer (_P_ heterogeneity = 0.008).
- Overall, circulating total carotenoids were inversely associated with breast cancer
  risk (_P_ trend = 0.01).
- Among women in the highest tertile of mammographic density, total carotenoids were
  associated with a 50% reduction in breast cancer risk (odds ratio, 0.5; 95% confidence
  interval, 0.3–0.8).
- In contrast, there was no inverse association between carotenoids and breast cancer
  risk among women with low mammographic density.
- Similarly, among women in the highest tertile of mammographic density, high levels
  of circulating α-carotene, β-cryptoxanthin, lycopene, and lutein/zeaxanthin were
  associated with a significant 40% to 50% reduction in breast cancer risk (_P_ trend
  &lt; 0.05).
- Our results suggest that plasma levels of carotenoids may play a role in reducing
  breast cancer risk, particularly among women with high mammographic density.
