- Although many in vitro and animal studies have suggested a protective effect of
  green tea against breast cancer, only a few epidemiological studies have examined
  this association, and findings have been inconsistent.
- We examined the association between green tea consumption and breast cancer risk
  in consideration of the hormone receptor status of tumors and investigated whether
  the association was modified by dietary and genetic factors based on a hospital-based
  case-control study in Nagano, Japan.
- A total of 369 pairs completed a validated food frequency questionnaire and provided
  blood samples.
- 'Four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped: _CYP19A1_ (rs10046),
  _COMT_ (rs4680), _MTHFR_ C677T (rs1801133), and _MTHFR_ A1298C (rs1801131).'
- We found no inverse association between green tea consumption and breast cancer
  risk.
- Compared with women who drank less than 120 ml of green tea per day, the adjusted
  odds ratio for women who drank more than 600 ml was 1.27 (95% confidence interval
  = 0.75â€“2.14; _P_ for trend = 0.20).
- We also found no inverse association for either tumor subtype.
- No substantial effect modification was observed for menopausal status, 4 SNPs, or
  dietary intake of folate or isoflavone.
- This study provides additional evidence that green tea consumption is not associated
  with a decreased risk.
