- _Extracted lipids from adzuki beans (_Vigna angularis_) were determined by high-performance
  liquid chromatography for tocopherol homologues.
- Fatty acid distributions of triacylglycerols (TAGs) and major phospholipids (PLs)
  were analyzed by gas chromatography, and their tocopherol contents were determined.
- δ-Tocopherol was present in highest concentration (77.6%), and γ-tocopherol in small
  amounts (22.4%).
- However, α\- and β-tocopherols were not detected in adzuki beans.
- The major lipid components were PL (63.5%) and TAG (27.1%), while other components
  were also present in minor proportions (0.2-5.1%).
- The major PL components were phosphatidylcholine (45.3%), phosphatidylethanolamine
  (25.8%) and phosphatidylinositol (21.5%).
- 'The positional distribution of fatty acids in these PLs was evident in the beans:
  unsaturated fatty acids were predominantly located in the sn-2 position, while saturated
  fatty acids primary occupied the sn-1 position in these lipids._




  This study describes the characteristics of lipid components, positional distribution
  of fatty acids in the major phospholipids as well as the tocopherol profiles of
  adzuki beans.'
- These results were not similar to the positional fatty acid distributions in the
  oilseeds such as peanuts, soybeans and sesame seeds.
- The data obtained would be useful to both consumers and producers for manufacturing
  traditional adzuki confectionaries (_wagashi_) in Japan and elsewhere.
- Adzuki or small red beans (_Vigna angularis_) are a popular ingredient in many confections
  in the orient.
- The consumption of adzuki is concentrated in Japan, where the bean has an important
  economic value.
- The predominant use of adzuki in traditional Japanese confections is _wagashi_ such
  as _youkan_, _manju_ and _amanatoo_ (Sperbeck 1981; Hoshikawa 1985; Shi 1988).
- Adzuki beans serve as a rich source of carbohydrates, protein, fiber, vitamins and
  minerals (Tjahjadi _et al._ 1988).
- When adzuki beans are used for confectionaries, they are boiled in a cooker and
  yield a hot water extract as a by-product, which is known to contain active ingredients,
  but is washed.
- It has been reported that the 40% ethanol fraction of hot water extract from adzuki
  beans suppresses not only the proliferation of human stomach cancer cells in culture
  but also benzo (α) pyrene-induced tumorigenesis in the mouse forestomach (Itoh _et
  al._ 2002, 2004).
- Wu _et al._ (2004) have recently shown that a water-soluble extract of the adzuki
  bean could inhibit acetaminophen-induced liver damage.
- Han _et al._ (2004) have reported the protective action of an adzuki extract against
  acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity via a hepatic GSH-mediated antioxidant/detoxification
  system in rat liver after 4 weeks of feeding.
- To the best of our knowledge, however, no data are available on the positional distribution
  of fatty acids in the major phospholipids (PLs) obtained from adzuki beans.
- The objective of the present study was to determine the lipid class compositions,
  the fatty acid profiles of PLs and the tocopherol contents of adzuki beans.
- The data obtained should be useful to both producers and consumers for manufacturing
  traditional adzuki confectionaries (_wagashi_).
- The commercially available mature adzuki beans (_V.
- angularis_ cv.
- Dainagon) used in this study were harvested in Japan (Kyoto Prefecture) during the
  summer of 2006.
- The cultivar (Takii Seed Co., Kyoto, Japan) was selected for uniformity-based seed
  weight of 210-240 mg per bean.
- Beans were divided into groups and stored in separate stainless steel containers
  at 4C prior to the experiment.
- Vitamin E homologues (α, β, γ and δ) were purchased from Eisai Co. (Tokyo, Japan).
- All tocopherols were of the D-form (_RRR_-), and their purities were better than
  98.5% as determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using 2,2,5,7,8-pentamethyl-6-hydroxychroman
  as internal standard, as described in a later section.
- All chemicals and solvents used were of analytical grade (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto,
  Japan).
- However, diethyl ether was further purified to remove peroxides.
- Thin-layer chromatography (TLC)-precoated silica gel 60 plates (10 × 20 cm or 20
  × 20 cm, 0.25 mm layer thickness) were purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany).
- The TLC standard mixture containing monoacylglycerols (MAGs), diacylglycerols (DAGs),
  free fatty acids (FFAs), triacylglycerols (TAGs), steryl esters (SEs) and hydrocarbons
  (HCs) was purchased from Nacalai Tesque.
- A PL kit from Serdary Research Laboratory (Mississauga, ON, Canada) was used as
  PL standard.
- Phospholipase A2 was from a bee (_Apis mellifera_) venom and obtained from Sigma
  Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO).
- Methyl pentadecanoate (15:0, 100 mg, Merck) was dissolved in _n_-hexane (20 mL)
  and used as internal standard.
- Boron trifluoride (BF3) in methanol (14%, Wako Pure Chemical, Inc., Osaka, Japan)
  was used to prepare fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs).
- The AOAC (1997) methods were used to determine the chemical composition of the adzuki
  beans.
- The beans were analyzed in triplicate for fat, protein and moisture contents according
  to the standard methods.
- Fat content was determined by solvent extraction (method 991.36), protein content
  by the Kjeldahl method (method 981.10) and moisture content by oven drying to constant
  weight at 105C (method 925.40).
- The beans (500 seeds) were extracted using a Maxim homogenizer (Nihonseiki Kaisha
  Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) at high speed for 10 min at 0C with 200 mL of chloroform/methanol
  (2:1, v/v) fortified with butylated hydroxytoluene (0.01%), which was added to inhibit
  the oxidative degradation of lipids during analysis.
- The homogenate was vacuum filtered through defatted filter paper (the paper was
  extracted at several times with choroform/methanol [2:1, v/v] before usage) on a
  Buchner funnel, and the filter residue was rehomogenized with a second volume of
  chloroform/methanol.
- The filtrates were combined and dried in a rotary vacuum evaporator at 35C.
- The residue was dissolved in 100 mL of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v); then, 20
  mL aqueous potassium chloride (0.75%) was added (Folch _et al._ 1957), and the phases
  were mixed vigorously.
- After phase separation, the chloroform layer was withdrawn, dried over anhydrous
  sodium sulfate and filtered, and the filtrate was concentrated under vacuum.
- The extracted lipids were weighed to determine the lipid content of the beans and
  then transferred to a 25-mL brown glass volumetric flask with chloroform/methanol
  (2:1, v/v).
- Analysis of tocopherols in the oils was performed by HPLC as described earlier (Yoshida
  _et al._ 2006).
- A mixture of _n_-hexane/1,4-dioxane/ethanol (490:10:1, v/v/v) was used as the mobile
  phase at a flow rate of 2.0 mL/min.
- A 0.2-mL portion of the sample, after removal of the extraction solvents, under
  a stream of nitrogen, was placed in a 5-mL brown volumetric flask and diluted with
  the mobile phase.
- An aliquot (4 µL) from this sample solution was injected using the same method as
  described earlier, and the amount of each tocopherol was monitored with a fluorescence
  detector (Shimadzu RF-10 AXL, Kyoto, Japan) set at 295 nm excitation wavelength
  and 320 nm emission wavelength, and were quantified as previously described (Yoshida
  _et al._ 2006).
- Using previously described methods (Yoshida _et al._ 2004), the total lipids were
  fractionated by TLC into eight fractions.
- Bands corresponding to HC, SE, TAG, FFA, 1,3-DAG, 1,2-DAG, MAG and PL were scraped
  separately into test tubes (105 × 16 mm, polytetrafluoroethylene-coated screw caps).
- Methyl pentadecanoate (C15:0, 10 or 100 µg) from a standard solution (5 mg/mL) was
  added to each tube as internal standard with a microsyringe (Hamilton Co., Reno,
  NV).
- Part of the polar lipids was further separated by TLC into several zones with chloroform/methanol/acetic
  acid/deionized water (170:30:20:7, v/v/v/v) as the mobile phase.
- 'Each band was located by exposure to iodine vapor, and PL classes were identified
  not only by comparison with _R_f values of standard PL similarly chromatographed,
  but also by specific reagents: Dragendorff reagent for choline lipids, 0.25% ninhydrin
  in acetone for amino-containing lipids and molybdate reagent for PL.'
- Bands corresponding to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylcholine (PC) and
  phosphatidylinositol (PI) and others were scraped carefully into test tubes, respectively,
  and methyl pentadecanoate (25 µg) was added as described earlier.
- 'With an exception of HC, FAMEs were prepared from the isolated lipids by heating
  with silica gel for 30 min at 80C in BF3-methanol on an aluminum block bath (AOCS
  1992: method Ce 2-66).'
- After cooling, 5 mL of _n_-hexane was added to each tube and was washed several
  times with deionized water to remove BF3 and silica gel.
- The _n_-hexane layer containing the FAME was recovered and dried over anhydrous
  sodium sulfate.
- The solvent was then vaporized under a gentle stream of nitrogen, and the residue
  was quantified in a gas chromatograph (GC) (Shimadzu model-14B) equipped with a
  hydrogen flame ionization detector and a capillary column (ULBO HE-SS-10 for FAMEs
  fused silica WCOT, cyanopropyl silicone, 30 m × 0.32 mm i.d.
- ; Shinwa Chem.
- Ind., Ltd., Kyoto, Japan) at a column temperature of 180C.
- The injection and detector temperatures were held at 220 and 250C, respectively.
- The initial oven temperature was 180C.
- This temperature was maintained for 5 min and then increased at a rate of 2C/min
  to 200C, which was held for 15 min.
- Helium was used as carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.5 mL/min, and the GC was operated
  under a constant pressure of 180 kPa.
- All samples were dissolved in _n_-hexane for injection.
- The component peaks were identified and calibrated by comparison with those of standard
  FAMEs (F and OR mixtures no.
- 3, Altech Applied Science, State College, PA) using an electronic integrator (Shimadzu
  C-R4A).
- The detection limit was 0.05 wt % of total fatty acids for each FAME in a FAME mixture,
  and the results were expressed as wt % of total FAMEs.
- The positional distribution of fatty acids in each of the PE, PC and PI samples
  isolated by preparative TLC was determined by phospholipase A2 hydrolysis (Yoshida
  _et al._ 2007).
- Briefly, 3-7 mg of each PL was suspended in 0.5 mL of 0.25 M Tris buffer (pH 7.5)
  containing 0.01 M CaCl2 in a 10-mL Erlenmeyer flask.
- To this suspension, 5 mg of phospholipase A2 and 10 mL of diethyl ether were added.
- The reaction mixture was incubated at 28C for up to 10 h with continuous shaking
  under a nitrogen atmosphere.
- The hydrolysis was almost complete (&gt;98%) in this period, as judged from a preliminary
  experiment using a standard PL.
- Diethyl ether was evaporated under nitrogen, and samples were extracted with chloroform/methanol
  (2:1. v/v).
- To obtain the different products after this hydrolysis, the lipid extracts were
  subjected to one-dimensional TLC with chloroform/methanol/deionized water (65:25:4,
  v/v/v).
- The spots were visualized with iodine vapor, and the bands corresponding to the
  FFAs and lysophospholipids were separately scraped into test tubes.
- The constituent fatty acids were analyzed by GC after methylation as described earlier.
- All preparations and measurements were carried out in triplicate, and the data were
  subjected to one-way analysis of variance (Steel _et al._ 1997).
- Duncan's multiple range test was performed to determine any significant differences
  (_P_ &lt; 0.05) among treatments (Duncan 1955).
- The tocopherol contents in the oils prepared from adzuki beans are shown in Fig.
- 1
- The major tocopherol was δ-tocopherol (77.6%), and γ-tocopherol (22.4%) was a minor
  component.
- γ-Tocopherol is a more potent antioxidant in oils than other tocopherols (Grela
  and Gunter 1995).
- However, α\- and β-tocopherols were not detected in adzuki beans.
- This distribution pattern is a very unique one and differs from other plant seeds
  such as sunflower seeds (Yoshida _et al._ 2002) or peanuts (Yoshida _et al._ 2003)
  in which α\- and β-tocopherols are usually detected.
- Figure 1\.
- TOCOPHEROL CONTENTS IN ADZUKI BEANS Each value shows the average of three replicates.
- Horizontal bars depict the standard error of the replicates.
- 'The major chemical components of adzuki beans were: moisture 3.9%, fat 2.5% and
  protein 20.3%.'
- Adzuki beans are high in complex carbohydrates, protein and fiber, yet are extremely
  low in fat (Hsieh _et al._ 1992).
- The compositional analyses carried out in this study included determination of the
  lipid classes and the fatty acid compositions of the oils.
- Profiles of different lipid classes in the beans are shown in Table 1.
- Predominant components were PL (63.5%), followed by TAG (27.1%) and SE (5.1%), accompanied
  by very little amounts of HC (1.6%), FFA (0.9%), 1,3-DAG (0.2%), 1,2-DAG (1.1%)
  and MAG (0.5%).
- Adzuki beans are not oilseeds but typical vegetable seeds (Lee _et al._ 2000).
- Therefore, PL content is quite significant, whereas glycolipids are present only
  in trace amounts, indicating that PLs form the principal components of the cell
  membranes in the beans.
- Adzuki beans contain considerable amounts of phenolic compounds (Duke 1981) that
  possess varying degrees of antioxidant activity.
- Further investigation should be carried out to clarify the interrelation between
  the PL and phenolic compounds in adzuki beans.
- To clarify the distribution of major PL in the beans, further separation of the
  PL fraction into several fractions (PE, PC, PI and others) was carried out using
  TLC in the presence of authentic standards.
- Table 2 shows the profiles of PL components of the beans.
- The original amounts of each PL were approximately 408.1 mg (25.8%), 680.2 mg (45.3%)
  and 340.0 mg (21.5%) per 100 g beans for PE, PC and PI, respectively.
- These PLs form the principal components of the cell membranes in the beans.
- Because membrane lipids are involved in such fundamental cell processes as ion transport,
  energy generation and biological reactions, they are highly conserved in terms of
  both quantity and quality (Alvarez-Ortega _et al._ 1997).
- This may explain why the fatty acid composition in newly differentiated tissue was
  conserved regardless of genotype.
- Fatty acid distributions (expressed in terms of the esters by weight) of total lipids,
  TAG and PL in the beans are shown in Fig.
- 2
- The principal fatty acid components of legumes are generally palmitic (16:0), stearic
  (18:0), oleic (18:1_n_-9), linoleic (18:2_n_-6) and α-linolenic (18:3_n_-3) acids,
  the distribution of which varies according to the three lipid classes.
- Moreover, long-chain saturated fatty acids (22:0 and 24:0) were also detected at
  low percentages (1.8-3.7%) in the TAG.
- The samples had high amounts of total unsaturated fatty acids which consisted mainly
  of linoleic acid (18:2_n_-6), followed by α-linolenic (18:3_n_-3) and oleic (18:1_n_-9)
  acids, representing 71.2, 59.2 and 55.6% of total lipids, TAG and PL, respectively.
- Some differences (_P_ &lt; 0.05) in fatty acid composition existed when comparing
  the three lipid classes.
- With a few exceptions, the percentage of palmitic acid (16:0) was higher (_P_ &lt;
  0.05) in the PL (Fig.
- 2, right), while α-linolenic acid (18:3_n_-3) was higher (_P_ &lt; 0.05) in the
  TAG (Fig.
- 2, center).
- However, the percentage of linoleic acid (18:2_n_-6) was less (_P_ &lt; 0.05) in
  the TAG than that in the total lipids or PL.
- These profiles in the fatty acid distributions are not similar to the results reported
  in typical vegetable seeds such as kidney beans (Yoshida _et al._ 2005) or peas
  (Yoshida _et al._ 2007).

- FATTY ACID DISTRIBUTIONS OF TOTAL LIPIDS, TRIACYLGLYCEROLS AND PHOSPHOLIPIDS PREPARED

- Vertical bars depict the standard error of the replicates.
- Other minor fatty acids include 14:0, 16:1, 20:0, 22:0 and 24:0.
- The compositions of fatty acids in PE, PC and PI were compared (Figs.
- 3-5).
- The major fatty acids in the three PLs were palmitic, stearic, oleic, linoleic and
  α-linolenic acids.
- These distribution patterns were very similar to each other between PE and PC, whereas
  PI was unique in that it had the highest saturated fatty acid contents (&gt;50%)
  among the three PLs (Fig.
- 5).
- 'With a few exceptions, however, the positional distribution of fatty acids in PE,
  PC and PI was observed in these major PLs: saturated fatty acids were mostly located
  in the _sn_-1 position while unsaturated fatty acids predominantly occupied the
  _sn_-2 position of these molecules.'
- The data are not necessarily identical with those of other plant seeds reported
  in the literature (Miyazawa and Fujino 1976; Vichi _et al_.
- 2007).

- Vertical bars depict the standard error of the replicates.
- Other minor fatty acids include 14:0, 16:1, 2:0, 22:0 and 24:0.
- The dominant components in adzuki beans were PL and TAG, whereas other lipid components
  were also present in minor proportions.
- δ-Tocopherol was present in the highest concentration, and γ-tocopherol was present
  in minor amounts.
- PC was detected as the dominant component (45.3%), followed by PE (25.8%) and PI
  (21.5%).
- The principal characteristics of fatty acid distributions were evident in the major
  PL; unsaturated fatty acids, especially linoleic and α-linolenic acids, were more
  concentrated in the _sn_-2 position, while saturated fatty acids, palmitic and stearic
  acids primarily occupied the _sn_-1 position in these lipids.
- These results would be useful to both producers and consumers for manufacturing
  traditional Japanese adzuki confectionaries (_wagashi_ or _an paste_).
