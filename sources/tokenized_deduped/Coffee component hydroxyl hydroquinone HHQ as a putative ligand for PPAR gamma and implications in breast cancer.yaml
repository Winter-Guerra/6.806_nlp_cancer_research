- Coffee contains several compounds that have the potential to influence breast cancer
  risk and survival.
- However, epidemiologic data on the relation between coffee compounds and breast
  cancer survival are sparse and inconsistent.
- We show that coffee component HHQ has significant apoptotic effect on MDA-MB-231
  and MCF-7 cells _in vitro_, and that ROS generation, change in mitochondrial membrane
  permeability, upregulation of Bax and Caspase-8 as well as down regulation of PGK1
  and PKM2 expression may be important apoptosis-inducing mechanisms.
- The results suggest that PPARγ ligands may serve as potential therapeutic agents
  for breast cancer therapy.
- HHQ was also validated as a ligand for PPARγ by docking procedure.
- This is the first report on the anti-breast cancer (_in vitro_) activity of HHQ.
- Breast cancer is the fifth most common cancer globally and accounts for the highest
  morbidity and mortality.
- It is the second highest occurring cancer in women and one of the leading causes
  of death [1].
- Although anti-estrogens have provided an effective endocrine therapy, a significant
  proportion of patients have acquired resistance to these drugs.
- Hence, there is a requirement for alternative therapeutics to treat breast cancer.
- Since, cancer cells modify several pathways to achieve continuous progression and
  survival, and undergo metabolic alterations, it is important that multiple target
  strategies are used to achieve effective treatment.
- Several drugs that inhibit metabolism of cancer cells by targeting a variety of
  molecules (including enzymes) directly or indirectly are currently under clinical
  trials, hence it is important to screen drugs with a potential to target critical
  molecules involved in metabolic transformation [2].
- PPARγ receptor is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily which upon ligand
  activation undergoes heterodimerization with retinoic acid-like receptor (RXR) and
  is translocated to the nucleus where it recognizes a specific sequence - the peroxisome
  proliferator response element (PPRE) located within promoters of target genes, and
  acts as a transcription regulator for genes involved in proliferation, cell differentiation,
  apoptosis, angiogenesis, inflammation, organogenesis, and lipid and carbohydrate
  metabolism and energy homeostasis [3-5].
- Two isoforms of PPARγ have been identified (PPARγ 1 and PPARγ 2), with a wide tissue
  distribution among various animal species [6].
- PPARγ are expressed in a variety of tumor cells and PPARγ agonists e.g Thiazolidinediones
  (TZDs), and tyrosine based agonists show cytostatic and cytotoxic activity against
  tumor cells _in vitro _and _in vivo _brought about by regulating proteins involved
  in growth regulatory pathways and cell cycle [7].
- TZDs are also reported to induce G0/G1 arrest and apoptosis of malignant cells by
  upregulation of the tumor suppressor p53, and control of DNA repair systems and
  apoptosis [8].
- However, the exact mechanism of action and the genes regulated by PPARγ and biological
  functions of this transcription factor are not known and need elucidation.
- Also, due to high levels of toxicity associated with TZDs (e.g.
- '- troglitazone (Rezulin), rosiglitazone (Avandia), and pioglitazone (Actos)), and
  their recent withdrawal in several countries, there is a need to search for newer
  PPAR drugs that exhibit better efficacy but lesser toxicity.'
- Phytochemicals in dietary components are increasingly being used as nutritional
  supplements in treatment of diseases.
- Due to the plant origin of these supplements they are considered safe for human
  consumption [9].
- Present data reveal that healthy dietary molecules have a pleiotropic role and are
  able to change cell metabolism from anabolism to catabolism, modulate energy homeostasis
  and down regulate inflammation by interacting with enzymes, nuclear receptors and
  transcriptional factors [10].
- Towards this end developing and positioning known phytochemicals that bind and activate
  PPARγ with more efficacy and safety, while promoting health benefits has become
  an absolute necessity.
- Also, it is important to identify the dietary molecules able to influence the course
  of the disease, their targets in the cell, and the molecular mechanisms involved.
- Coffee is one of the most widely consumed beverages in the world.
- The health-promoting properties of coffee are often attributed to its rich phytochemistry,
  including caffeine, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, hydroxyl hydroquinone (HHQ),
  etc.
- More recently, coffee consumption has been associated with reductions in the risk
  of several chronic diseases, including type 2 diabetes mellitus, Parkinson's disease
  and hepatocellular disease [11-13].
- The association between coffee intake and breast cancer risk is biologically plausible
  because of its complex make-up of chemicals, e.g., caffeine and polyphenolic compounds
  such as flavonoids and lignans [14-16].
- Among them, the relationship between coffee drinking and breast cancer risk holds
  great interest.
- Recent meta-analyses demonstrate inverse associations between coffee intake and
  the risk of colon, liver, breast, and endometrial cancer [17-20].
- Also, a high daily intake of coffee has recently been reported to be associated
  with a statistically significant decrease in ER-negative breast (ER - Estrogen Responsive)
  cancer among postmenopausal women [21].
- A number of previous epidemiologic studies have estimated the association between
  coffee consumption and breast cancer risk.
- However, the results are inconsistent [22].
- Nevertheless, several reports in literature suggest that coffee consumption reduces
  the risk of cancer, but the molecular mechanisms of its chemopreventive effects
  remain unknown.
- Moreover, the interpretation of these data has often been limited to the role that
  caffeine plays [23,24].
- HHQ is a natural constituent of coffee accounting for main dry matter constituent
  in roasted beans.
- Studies exploring the effects of this bioactive compound on mammalian cells are
  limited.
- HHQ was observed to dock and form hydrogen bonds with PDB ID - 2PRG (PDB 3-D crystal
  structure of the Ligand-binding domain of the human peroxisome proliferator activated
  receptor gamma solved in complexation with Rosiglitazone, the PPAR gamma agonist/ligand).
- The initial purpose of our investigation is to determine whether HHQ alters the
  cell viability in estrogen dependent human breast cancer (MCF-7) and estrogen independent
  (MDA-MB-231) cells as a model system.
- HHQ was observed to decrease cell viability and colony formation in a dose-responsive
  manner and ROS was found to significantly increase in HHQ treated cells in a dose-dependent
  manner in both the cell lines.
- We examined the involvement of ROS signaling components (ROS levels and membrane
  potential) and demonstrated that the selective killing of cancer cells is mediated
  by induction of oxidative stress that leads to apoptosis.
- These findings were complemented by the finding that caspase-8 is upregulated.
- Since glucose utilization provides a constant energy supply, as well as precursors
  for de novo macromolecular biosynthesis, including DNA, RNA, fatty acids and amino
  acids that are essential for cell growth and proliferation, we further investigated
  the effect of HHQ on two key glycolytic genes PGK1 and PKM2 (at the ATP generation
  step) and observed that both the genes are repressed in a dose-dependent manner.
- These data suggest on the apoptotic and anti-cancer properties of HHQ via PPARγ.
- Further investigations on these could possibly help us in understanding the molecular
  mechanisms by which PPARγ regulates disease targets specifically in breast cancer
  and the use of HHQ in breast cancer therapeutics.
- Understanding the molecular pathways that link tumor biology to the staggering array
  of pathologies and genes is of paramount scientific and medical importance.
- Though, the complexity of the underlying biochemical and molecular mechanisms of
  breast cancer make metabolic reprogramming and transformation in breast cancer unclear,
  many dietary compounds have been identified as potential chemopreventive agents.
- PPARγ is an interesting target for cancer therapy as its expression is elevated
  in tumors and also because PPARγ activation is reported to result in decreased cell
  proliferation, decreased G0/G1 to S phase progression, apoptosis and increased terminal
  differentiation [25-27].
- Also, imbalances in expression of target genes forms the core of metabolic syndrome
  and cancer regulation through atherogenic metabolic triad/lipid triad metabolism
  modulation by PPARs [28].
- Concurrently, increased levels of glycolytic proteins are observed in plasmas of
  women with breast cancer as a result of upregulation of glycolysis pathway [29].
- In this paper, we for the first time report on the use of coffee component HHQ as
  a potential ligand for PPARγ and its role in induction of apoptosis in breast cancer
  cells by delineating the glycolytic pathway gene regulation by PPARγ activation.
- The three-dimensional protein structures can be used to understand ligand binding
  and to rationally design novel ligands as prospective drug compounds.
- PPAR agonists typically possess a small polar region and a hydrophobic region that
  form hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions, respectively, within the ligand
  binding domain.
- Several crystal structures of PPARγ in complexation with their ligands are available
  in the protein data bank (PDB).
- Here, we used the PDB crystal structure 2PRG (PPARγ with ligand Rosiglitazone) for
  structure-based identification of HHQ as a potential ligand for PPARγ in breast
  cancer therapeutics.
- We also compared the ligand binding properties of the two compounds Rosiglitazone
  (the known ligand) and HHQ (the proposed novel ligand).
- The rerank scores for the Rosiglitazone and HHQ were found to be -122.433 and -33.3562,
  respectively.
- The hydrogen bond energy values were -5.487 kcal/mol, and -9.460 kcal/mol for Rosiglitazone
  and HHQ.
- Rosiglitazone (the ligand in the crystal structure 2PRG) forms 3 hydrogen bonds
  with the 2PRG (Gln286, His449, Ser289) and HHQ forms 5 hydrogen bonds with 2PRG
  (Gln286, His449, Tyr473, Ser289, His323).
- Hydrogen bonding of the ligand to Tyr473 is reported to be the key to the stabilization
  of the AF-2 region and it has also been shown that [30] agonistic activity of ligands
  disappears when Tyr473 is mutated.
- The importance of His323 and His449 has also been reported [31,32].
- Our results show that both the ligands have hydrogen bond interactions with key
  residues - Tyr473 and His 449, thereby providing specificity of interaction that
  is a fundamental aspect of molecular recognition.
- The active site residues that interact with HHQ are shown in Table 1 and the hydrogen
  bonds between each compound and the 2PRG active site are shown in Figure 1.
- Figure 1.

- To investigate the potential cell growth inhibition of _HHQ_, we first examined
  the effect of HHQ on cell proliferation and clonogenic survival in human breast
  adenocarcinomas.
- For this we chose two breast adenocarcinoma cell lines, MDA-MB-231 (estrogen independent)
  and MCF-7 (estrogen dependent).
- MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 were cultured in the control medium for 24 h, followed by 48
  h treatment with different concentrations of HHQ for cytotoxic and anti-proliferative
  studies.
- HHQ led to decrease in relative density of viable cells as detected by MTT dye reduction
  assay.
- A dose-effect relationship was observed as shown in Figure 2.
- The IC-50 value for MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 were found to be 25 μM and 50 μM, respectively.
- We proceeded with 12.5 μM and 25 μM of HHQ to investigate the comparable effects
  of same concentration on both the cell lines.
- At 12.5 μM the relative viability in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 was 58.2% and 76.3%, respectively,
  whereas at 25 μM the relative viability in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 was 50% and 60.7%,
  respectively.
- As morphological analyses depict the health of a cell, we next examined the cells
  for any altered morphology on treatment with HHQ.
- Cells cultured in the presence of HHQ (12.5 μM and 25 μM) show significant morphological
  changes and were found to be reduced in cell mass as well as number as compared
  to control.
- Also, HHQ treatment induced detachment and rounding in breast cancer cells as shown
  by phase contrast images in both the cell lines (Figure 3 (12.5 μM and 25 μM)).
- Furthermore, to examine the antitumor activity of HHQ on colony forming potential
  in breast cancer cells we performed clonogenic assay.
- This assay is an _in vitro _assay based on the ability of a single cell to proliferate
  and differentiate into colonies in response to various insults.
- HHQ severely affected the colony forming potential of human breast cancer cells
  - MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7.
- As shown in Figure 4A and 4B clonogenicity of both the breast cancer lines were
  found to be significantly reduced in a concentration-dependent manner after exposure
  to HHQ.
- Figure 2.
- Growth curve inhibition as assessed by MTT assay in human breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231
  (blue line) and MCF-7 (grey line)).
- The breast cancer cells were exposed to different doses of HHQ for 48 h at 37 °C.
- The cell viability in breast cancer cells decreased in dose-dependent fashion.
- The IC-50 value for MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 were observed to be 25 μM and 50 μM, respectively.
- Data are representative of three independent experiments done in triplicates and
  expressed as mean ± S.E.M.
- p &lt; 0.005 represents statistical significant difference between control and HHQ
  test groups.
- Figure 3.
- Phase contrast images of human breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7).
- The breast cancer cells were exposed to 12.5 µM and 25 µM concentration of HHQ for
  48 h at 37 °C.
- HHQ treated groups did not retain their normal morphology.
- HHQ induced cell rounding and detachment in breast cancer cells.

  48 h at 37 °C.
- '[A] Representative plates; [B] graph of the number of colonies formed (the result
  of three independent experiments, expressed as mean ± SEM).'
- Decrease in number of colonies in HHQ treated groups were statistically significant
  (P&lt;0.05).
- Reactive oxygen species (ROS) is a universal entity mediating apoptosis [33].
- ROS act as a secondary messenger in cell signaling and are essential for various
  biological processes in normal cells.
- Disturbances in redox balance relate to human pathogenesis including cancers.
- ROS are constantly generated and eliminated in the biological system, and play important
  roles in a variety of normal biochemical functions and abnormal pathological processes.
- Growing evidence suggests that cancer cells exhibit increased intrinsic ROS stress,
  due in part to oncogenic stimulation, increased metabolic activity, and mitochondrial
  malfunction.
- Since ROS are chemically active and can inflict severe cellular damage, the very
  fact that cancer cells are under increased intrinsic ROS stress may also provide
  a unique opportunity to kill the malignant cells based on their vulnerability to
  further ROS insults caused by exogenous agents [34].
- HHQ is earlier reported to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) by autoxidation
  [35].
- Therefore, to get further insights to HHQ induced cytotoxicity in breast cancer
  cells; we examined the intracellular ROS generation.
- As shown in Figure 5, intracellular ROS formation was found to be significantly
  increased in HHQ treated cells as compared to control cells in a dose-dependent
  manner.
- The effective enhancement of ROS production by HHQ correlates to its cytotoxicity
  nature.
- Since the mitochondrial respiratory chain (electron transport chain) is a major
  source of ROS generation in the cells, the vulnerability of the mitochondrial DNA
  to ROS mediated damage has been suggested to be a mechanism to amplify ROS stress
  in cancer cells [36].
- One major effect is to generate increased intracellular ROS causing loss of outer
  mitochondrial membrane permeability and induction of apoptosis [37,38].
- Another possible mechanism by which cancer cells generate increased amounts of ROS
  may involve malfunction of the mitochondrial respiratory chain.
- The fact that cancer cells exhibit an increased dependency on glycolysis to meet
  their ATP need (the Warburg effect) may reflect an inefficient ATP generation in
  mitochondria, or "respiration injury" [39].
- A correlation between mtDNA mutations and increased ROS contents in primary leukemia
  cells isolated from patients has been shown [40].
- Because the mitochondrial respiratory chain is the major site of ROS generation
  due to electron transfer, malfunction of the mitochondrial respiratory chain associated
  with mtDNA mutations is likely to result in more free radical production due to
  increased "leakage" in mitochondrial membrane.
- Figure 5.
- HHQ induced intracellular ROS production in human breast cancer cells, MDA-MB-231
  [A] and MCF-7 [C].
- The breast cancer cells were treated with 12.5 μM and 25 μM of HHQ for 48 h at 37
  °C, intracellular ROS was detected by a fluorescent microscope.
- Quantitation of the ROS signals in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 is shown in [B] and [D],
  respectively.
- Significant increase in ROS level was observed in HHQ treated cells.
- Data are representative of three independent experiments done in triplicates and
  expressed as mean ± S.E.M.
- Increase in ROS generation in HHQ treated groups with 12.5 μM and 25 μM were statistically
  significant (P&lt;0.05).
- Mitochondria are central players in the determination of cell life and death.
- Their main physiological function is energy production by the oxidative phosphorylation
  pathway.
- This process not only involves production of cell energy currency, ATP but also
  increases the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as by-products of aerobic
  metabolism.
- Mitochondria are also the main regulators of apoptotic cell death by mediating extrinsic
  and intrinsic apoptotic pathways.
- Oxidative stress may cause oxidative damage to various cellular components and may
  lead to lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation, mitochondrial DNA mutations, initiation
  of apoptosis cascade by decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential and release
  of apoptogenic factor cytochrome c into the cytosol [41].
- Thus, the oxidative damage and the associated mitochondrial dysfunction may lead
  to energy depletion, accumulation of cytotoxic mediators, apoptosis and ultimately
  cell death.
- Therefore to investigate the effect of HHQ induced oxidative stress on mitochondria
  and apoptosis cascade initiation, we undertook mitochondrial membrane potential
  analysis using potential sensitive, cationic dye JC1.
- This dye exhibits potential-dependent accumulation in mitochondria, indicated by
  a fluorescence emission shift from green (525 nm) to red (590 nm).
- Consequently, live cells have higher red/green intensity ratio as compared to cells
  undergoing apoptosis.
- As shown in Figure 6, we observed that the breast cancer cells when treated with
  HHQ show loss of mitochondria membrane potential (MMP) in a dose-dependent manner.
- This decrease in MMP at 25 μM of HHQ was significant in both the cell lines.
- Furthermore, we found that the level of pro-apoptotic protein Bax, significantly
  increased in a concentration-dependent manner in both the breast cancer cells (Figure
  7).
- The expression levels of Bax correlates with the MMP loss in breast cancer cells
  on treatment with HHQ.
- This protein is involved in the mitochondrial apoptotic signaling pathway.
- The activation of the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bax, induces permeabilization
  of the mitochondrial outer membrane and release of cytochrome c leading to caspase
  dependent apoptosis [42,43].
- Together, these data corroborate with our previous results and demonstrate that
  there is disruption in mitochondrial potential, permeability and functioning upon
  PPARγ activation by HHQ.
- Figure 6.
- HHQ induced loss in mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) in human breast cancer
  cells (MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7).
- The breast cancer cells were treated with 12.5 μM and 25 μM of HHQ for 48 h at 37
  °C and then immunostained for JC1.
- HHQ treated cells showed loss of MMP comparable to that of the control cells.
- Data are representative of three independent experiments done in triplicates and
  expressed as mean ± S.E.M.
- p &lt; 0.005 represents statistical significant difference between control and HHQ
  test groups.
- Figure 7.
- Expression analyses of pro-apoptotic protein Bax in response to HHQ treatment in
  human breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7).
- The breast cancer cells were treated with 12.5 μM and 25 μM of HHQ for 48 h at 37
  °C.
- Representative western blot hybridization signals of Bax for MDA-MB-231 [A] and
  MCF-7 [B] and the quantitation of the signals is shown in [C] and [D], respectively.
- Significant increase in Bax expression was observed in HHQ treated cells.
- Data are presented as mean ± SEM of three independent experiments.
- p&lt; 0.005 represents statistical significant difference between control and HHQ
  test groups.
- Caspase-8 activation is one of the early events leading to apoptosis.
- PPAR synthetic ligands are known to activate intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic cascade
  [44,45].
- In order to understand the mechanism of cell death, we hypothesized that PPARγ ligand
  HHQ may initiate apoptosis cascade via PPARγ dependent pathway.
- To examine the above hypothesis we undertook the expression analysis of apoptotic
  protein, caspase-8.
- Interestingly, we observed that on treatment with HHQ the level of procaspase-8
  decreases significantly in both the cancer cells.
- This demonstrates that caspase-8 proenzyme is being cleaved to active caspase-8
  fragments in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 8).
- Concurrent increase in proapototic protein Bax, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential
  and activation of caspase-8 demonstrate PPARγ dependent apoptotic cascade activation
  by HHQ.
- Figure 8.
- Expression analyses of proenzyme caspase-8 in response to HHQ treatment in human
  breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7).
- The breast cancer cells were treated with 12.5 μM and 25 μM of HHQ for 48 h at 37
  °C.
- Representative western blot hybridization signals for proenzyme caspase-8 for MDA-MB-231
  [A] and MCF-7 [B] and the quantitation of the signals are shown in [C] and [D],
  respectively.
- Significant decrease in expression of proenzyme caspase-8 was observed in HHQ treated
  cells.
- Data are presented as mean ± SEM of three independent experiments.
- p&lt; 0.005 represents statistically difference between control and HHQ test groups.
- In 1930, Otto Warburg discovered the unknown link between highly proliferative nature
  of cancer cells and glycolysis.
- The phenomenon involved was described as the "Warburg Effect" which is characterized
  by increased glucose uptake and dependence on glycolysis for ATP production even
  in the presence of oxygen source.
- The glycolytic rate of rapidly proliferating tumor cells was found to be 200 times
  higher than those of their normal tissues of origin.
- Altenberg and Greulich (2004) found over expression of glycolytic genes in 24 different
  types of cancer including breast cancer.
- Two such glycolytic genes are phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1) and tumor specific
  pyruvate kinase muscle 2 (PKM2) [46,47].
- PGK1 and PKM2 catalyze the sixth and ninth step, respectively, in the glycolysis
  pathway generating two ATPs each.
- PGK1 also functions as a polymerase alpha cofactor protein (primer recognition protein)
  and is involved in DNA synthesis.
- PKM2 on the other hand is also a metabolic regulator and is also reported to be
  involved in channelization of glucose carbons to biosynthetic processes and hence
  control glycolysis.
- Hence, down regulating these enzymes would not only starve the cells for ATP but
  also lead to biosynthetic metabolite starvations, as they are important for tumor
  cell proliferation and survival.
- Earlier, we reported that both phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1) and pyruvate kinase
  M2 (PKM2) are repressed by PPARγ in the same two breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231
  and MCF-7.
- Further analysis suggested that this repression leads to decrease in ATP levels
  and apoptosis [48].
- Here, we hypothesized (based on docking results) that HHQ can modulate the expression
  of PGK1 and PKM2 via PPARγ dependent pathway.
- Therefore, to test this hypothesis, we undertook expression analysis of these metabolic
  enzymes.
- We observed that the expression of glycolytic genes, PGK1 and PKM2 was significantly
  reduced in both the breast cancer cells on treatment with HHQ in dose-dependent
  manner, Figure 9, 10.
- Further, to confirm the repression of glycolytic genes, PGK1 and PKM2 through HHQ
  induced PPARγ activation, we utilized GW9662, an irreversible PPARγ antagonist which
  acts by binding to the human ligand-binding domain (region E/F).
- As shown in Figure 11, no significant repression of PGK1 and PKM2 was seen on pre-treating
  the breast cancer cells with GW9662 (10 μM, 4h at 37 °C) followed by HHQ (12.5 μM
  and 25 μM, 48 h at 37 °C).
- GW9662 showed no effect of HHQ on expression of PGK1 and PKM2, thereby suggesting
  that the activation of PPARγ is required for repression of these enzymes.
- Conversely, these data suggests that HHQ represses the expression of glycolytic
  enzymes via PPARγ dependent pathway.
- Down regulation of PGK1 and PKM2 decreases ATP production in the cytoplasm and mitochondria,
  initiating apoptosis and suppressing cancer metabolism.
- ATP depletion, used in combination with chemotherapy and/or radiation, has a variety
  of effects on cancer cells including inducing apoptosis in multi-drug resistant
  cells and decreasing tumor promotion.
- Cellular ATP level has been reported as an important determinant of cell death [49].
- Though the exact mechanisms of these effects have not been fully elucidated, these
  investigations suggest on the role of HHQ as an anti-cancer agent.
- However, further work is required to establish the exact nature and behavior of
  this molecule in conjunction with other coffee components and to determine its relevance
  to the biological role of PPARγ breast cancer progression and therapeutics.

- The breast cancer cells were pre-treated with a potent PPARγ antagonist, GW9962
  (10 μM) for 4 h at 37 °C, followed by treatment with 12.5 μM and 25 μM of HHQ for

- Representative western blot hybridization signals for PGK1 [A] and PKM2 [B] for

- GW9662 showed no effect of HHQ on expression of PGK1 and PKM2, thereby suggesting
  that the activation of PPARγ is required for repression of these enzymes.
- Data are representative of three independent experiments and expressed as mean ±
  S.E.M.
- Our results have established previously unknown novel cross-link between HHQ, PPARγ,
  ROS and glycolysis; thereby adding a new dimension to therapeutic potential of PPARγ
  ligands.
- Although the exact mechanism remains unclear and further studies are still needed
  to clarify the potential role and molecular basis of action of PPARγ in breast carcinogenesis,
  our investigation open a new direction for development HHQ in breast cancer treatment.
- Further investigations on these could possibly help us in understanding the molecular
  mechanisms by which PPARγ regulates disease targets specifically in breast cancer
  and the use of its ligands in breast cancer therapeutics.
- Despite several advancements that have been made on the subject, there is still
  much to be clarified regarding PPARγ signaling in breast cancer and several important
  questions remain unanswered.
- Many intriguing avenues of PPARγ research have been opened and hold the potential
  to ultimately lead to newer classes of more selective molecules.
- Docking studies were carried out using MolDock™ (Molegro virtual docker) which is
  based on a new heuristic search algorithm that combines differential evolution with
  a cavity prediction algorithm (Thomsen &amp; Christensen, 2006).
- The PDB file for the crystal structure of PPARγ (PDB ID - 2PRG) was downloaded from
  http://www.rcsb.org webcite and transferred into the workspace keeping the orientation
  as a control.
- The energy between the existing ligand and protein was subsequently minimized.
- Both protein and ligands (Rosiglitazone and HHQ) were optimized in the workspace
  for docking by the addition of hydrogens.
- All structural water molecules were removed from the protein molecules using protein
  preparation wizard.
- Binding sites in the electrostatic surface of the protein was identified using the
  grid based cavity prediction algorithm.
- A total of five cavities were detected and the prepositioned ligand in the active
  site cavity was identified and the docking was constrained to the predicted active
  site cavity.
- MolDock™ scoring function is used for evaluating the energy between the ligand and
  the protein target.

- The carcinoma cultures were maintained in Dulbecco's modified eagle's medium supplemented
  with 10% fetal bovine serum and PNS antibiotic mixture 100 ng/ml at 37 °C and 5%
  CO2/95% O2.
- Cultures at about 50% confluency were treated with 12.5 µM and 25 µM of HHQ concentration
  for 48 h at 37 °C and for PPARγ activity inhibition studies, the breast cancer cells
  were pre-treated with GW9662 (10 μM, 4h at 37 °C) followed by HHQ (12.5 μM and 25
  μM, 48 h at 37 °C) and harvested for further use.
- HHQ was tested for its anti-proliferative activity on MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells
  using the 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromides (MTT)
  test (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) following manufacturer's instructions.
- The MTT metabolic activity is a colorimetric cell proliferation assay that identifies
  living cells, and is based on the cellular conversion of a tetrazolium salt into
  insoluble formazan, which can be quantified by spectrophotometry.
- 5 × 103 cells/ well were plated in 96-well plates and grown for 24 h. The cells
  were then exposed to varying concentrations of HHQ for 48 h to find the half maximal
  inhibitory concentration (IC50) values.
- The intensity of the reduced dye that corresponds to the viable cells was measured
  at reference wavelength of 570 nm by Thermo Scientific Varioskan Flash Multimode
  Reader.
- Morphological changes in breast cancer cells treated with 12.5 µM and 25 µM of HHQ
  concentration for 48 h were examined by phase contrast microscopy.
- All experiments were performed in triplicates, and the relative cell viability (%)
  was expressed as a percentage relative to the untreated control cells.
- Colony formation potential of human breast cancer cells on exposure to HHQ was assessed
  by clonogenic assay.
- Clonogenic assay is a cell survival assay based on the ability of a single cell
  to grow into a colony.
- To determine long-term effects, breast cancer cells were treated with 12.5 µM and
  25 µM of HHQ concentration for 48 h. At the end of treatment the breast cancer cells
  were then plated at a concentration of 100 cells/well in a new 6-well plate.
- The cells were allowed to grow for 14 days to form colonies.
- Fresh medium was replaced every third day.
- 'The colonies were washed with PBS and fixed in pre-chilled methanol: acetone mixture
  (1:1) for 10 min at room temperature.'
- The colonies were then stained with crystal violet dye (0.5% in water) at room temperature
  for overnight.
- Cells were washed with water and plates were photographed with image scanner (EPSON
  GT-1500).
- Quantitative analysis of the total number of colonies was performed with Image J
  software (National Institutes of Health).
- The reactive oxygen species were detected by fluorescent staining using the Image-iTTM
  LIVE Green Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) Detection Kit (Molecular Probes Inc, USA).
- The assay is based on a nonfluorescent and cell permeable 5-(and-6)-carboxy-2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein
  diacetate (carboxy-H2DCFDA).
- The carboxy-H2DCFDA permeates the live cells and is deacetylated by intracellular
  esterases.
- The reduced fluorescein compound is oxidized by the cellular ROS and emits bright
  green fluorescence with excitation/ emission maxima of 495/529 nm.
- The cells were grown on glass cover slips placed in 12-well plate and were treated
  with 12.5 µM and 25 µM concentration of HHQ for 48 h. Subsequently, cells were fixed
  and then stained for ROS by following manufacturer's instructions.
- The images were analyzed with AxioVision software (version 4.4, Carl Zeiss).
- Mitochondrial transmembrane potential was investigated using a fluorochrome, JC-1
  dye (Biotium).
- JC-1 (5,5',6,6'-tetrachloro-1,1',3,3' tetra ethyl benzimidazolyl carbo cyanine iodide)
  dye exhibits potential-dependent accumulation of red fluorescent J-aggregates in
  energized mitochondria.
- JC-1 exists as a green fluorescent (535 nm) monomer and also accumulates as J-aggregates
  (595 nm) in the active mitochondria, which stain red.
- Consequently, healthy cells will exhibit high red/green fluorescence intensity ratio.
- In apoptotic cells, mitochondrial depolarization is indicated by a decrease in the
  red/green fluorescence intensity ratio.
- Therefore this fluorescence emission shift from green (~529 nm) to red (~590 nm)
  is indicative of mitochondrial depolarization occurring during apoptosis.
- After 48 h of 12.5 µM and 25 µM of HHQ treatment, the cells were incubated with
  1X JC-1 dye at 37 °C for 15 min followed by washes with assay buffer.
- The red fluorescence (excitation 550 nm, emission 600 nm) and green fluorescence
  (excitation 485 nm, emission 535 nm) were measured using fluorescence Thermo Scientific
  Varioskan Flash Multimode plate reader.
- The ratio of red fluorescence to green fluorescence was determined in JC-1 stained
  cells.
- The relative mitochondrial membrane potential (%) was expressed as a percentage
  relative to the untreated control cells.
- In order to find out the modulation of test proteins by HHQ through PPARγ, the test
  protein were immunostained.
- For immunostaining, cells were plated on glass coverslips in a 12-well plate (104
  cells/coverslip).
- 'The cells were allowed to attach for 24 h and then exposed to 12.5 µM and 25 µM
  of HHQ for 48 h. At the end of treatment cells were washed with cold PBS three times
  and then fixed with pre-chilled methanol: acetone mixture (1:1) for 10 min at room
  temperature.'
- Fixed cells were washed twice with PBS, permeabilized with 0.32% Triton X-100 in
  PBS (PBST) for 10 min and blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS for
  30 min.
- The cells were then probed with anti-PGK1 (1:250; Abcam, Cambridge, UK), anti-PKM2
  (1:250; Abcam, Cambridge, UK), antibodies for overnight at 4°C.
- After primary antibody incubation the cells were washed thrice with 0.1% PBST, and
  then incubated with secondary antibodies (Alexa-594-conjugated goat anti-rabbit
  and Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse, (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 1 h
  at room temperature followed by 3 times washing with 0.1% PBST and then once with
  PBS.
- The coverslips were then mounted with ProLong+® Gold antifade reagent (Molecular
  Probes, Inc.) and observed under a microscope (Axiovert 200M; Carl Zeiss, Thornwood,
  NY).

  E. Sussex, UK.)
- semi-dry electroblotter for 30 min at 20 V. Subsequently, the membranes were blocked
  for 45 min at room temperature with 2% bovine serum albumin in 0.1% PBST.
- The membranes were then probed with anti-PGK1 (1:1000; Abcam, Cambridge, UK), anti-PKM2
  (1:500, Abcam), anti-caspase-8 (1:1000; Cell Signaling, Boston, MA, USA), Anti-Bax
  (1:1000; Cell Signaling) and anti-β-actin (1:20,000; Abcam) at 4°C overnight followed
  by three washes for 5 min each with 0.1% PBST.
- The membranes were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase conjugated secondary
  antibody (1:20,000; Abcam) for 45 min at RT and washed thrice for 5 min each with
  0.1% PBST followed by chemiluminescent detection using Luminescent Image Analyzer
  equipped with charge-coupled device camera (LAS-4000 Ver.
- 2.1; Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan).
