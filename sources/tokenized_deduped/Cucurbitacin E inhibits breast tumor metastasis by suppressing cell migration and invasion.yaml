- Tumor metastasis is the main cause of cancer-related deaths of patients.
- Breast cancer is highly malignant with considerable metastatic potential, which
  urges the necessity for developing novel potential drug candidate to prevent tumor
  metastasis.
- Here, we report our finding with Cucurbitacin E (CuE, α-elaterin), a tetracyclic
  triterpenes compound isolated from Cucurbitaceae.
- The potency of CuE on breast cancer metastasis inhibition was assessed in vivo and
  in vitro.
- In our animal experiments, intraperitoneal administrations of CuE significantly
  inhibited breast tumor metastasis to the lung without affecting apoptosis or proliferation
  of inoculated 4T1 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells.
- Treatment of metastatic breast tumor cells with CuE markedly blocked tumor cell
  migration and invasion in vitro.
- Subsequent studies showed that CuE impaired Arp2/3-dependent actin polymerization
  and suppressed Src/FAK/Rac1/MMP involved pathway.
- Overall, our data demonstrate that CuE blocks breast cancer metastasis by suppressing
  tumor cell migration and invasion.
- We provide first evidence of a novel role for CuE as a potential candidate for treating
  breast cancer metastasis.

  material, which is available to authorized users.
- According to statistics, breast cancer accounts for 30 % of all the cancer cases
  and ranks the second leading cause of cancer death among women [1].
- In these women, breast cancer metastasis poses a predominant threat to cancer-related
  mortality [2].
- Cancer metastasis is a complex cascade, which starts when a primary tumor forms
  and tumor cells break through the basement membrane (intravasation).
- These tumor cells then circulate through the blood, adhere to the capillary wall,
  escape from the blood vessel (extravasation), and proliferate to form metastasis
  [3].
- Failure in any of these steps may impair the entire metastatic process.
- One of the key steps in successful cancer metastasis is tumor cell migration and
  invasion, which is responsible for tumor cells enter into blood vessels as well
  as the extravasation into the secondary organs [4].
- Sustained organization of actin system is essential for cell migration.
- The Arp2/3 complex greatly accelerates actin polymerization, which is thought to
  play a vital role in actin-based cell migration by inducing formation of a dendritic
  actin network and membrane protrusions [5–7].
- In addition, the ability of tumor cells to migrate, invade and metastasize has been
  found to be related with increased Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK) expression, phosphorylation,
  and catalytic activity [8].
- Among downstream genes of FAK, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have been identified
  as the major molecules in cancer metastasis [9, 10].
- Previous study revealed that Src-FAK complex on MMP regulation is associated with
  signaling from Rac1 to Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which mediated extracellular
  matrix proteolysis and cell invasion [11, 12].
- Cucurbitacins are tetracyclic triterpenes derived from Cucurbitaceae [13] that contain
  circa 800 species in 130 genera and are among the economically most important families
  of plants [14].
- Previous reports showed cucurbitacins exhibited pharmacological effects, such as
  anti-inflammatory, anti-fertility, anti-virus, anti-cancer and so on [15–17].
- Cucurbitacin E (CuE, α-elaterin), one of cucurbitacins, could disrupt cell actin
  filaments and inhibit cell adhesion [15, 18].
- Recent research indicated that CuE exerts its anti-angiogenesis biological effect
  mainly through the Jak/STAT3 pathway [19].
- However, the function of CuE on tumor metastasis and its related molecular mechanism
  have not yet been investigated.
- In the current study, the inhibition of breast cancer metastasis in spontaneous
  and experimental mouse models by CuE is reported.
- CuE also suppressed breast cancer cell migration, invasion, and Arp2/3-dependent
  actin polymerization in vitro.
- Moreover, CuE blocked Src/FAK/Rac1/MMP signaling pathway and down-regulated Arp3
  expression in breast cancer cells.
- In conclusion, our data showed CuE impairs breast tumor metastasis via targeting
  tumor cell migration and invasion.

- The 4T1 mouse breast cancer cells were obtained from BALB/c mice and easily transplanted
  into the mammary fat pad, which ensures that the primary tumor grows in the proper
  anatomical site [30].
- 4T1 cells spontaneously metastasize to secondary foci (lymph node, lung, and liver)
  from the primary sites [31].
- The anti-metastatic function of CuE was tested in vivo by implanting 4T1 cells into
  4th mammary fat pad of 7-week-old female BALB/c mice.
- Remarkably, the number of metastasized 4T1 nodules in the lungs of mice treated
  with CuE (0.25 mg/kg per 2 days) reduced to 40 % compared with the control group
  (Fig.
- 1a).
- However, primary tumor size showed no evident difference between the treatment and
  control groups (Fig.
- 1b).
- These results indicated that CuE inhibited breast cancer metastasis in spontaneous
  animal tumor model but did not interfere with the primary tumor growth.
- Moreover, CuE did not cause obvious side effects because no indication of weight
  loss of mice (Fig.
- 1b) and morphology change of major organs (data not shown).
- Anti-metastasis effects of CuE on spontaneous experiment.
- 4T1 cells (105) were injected into the fat pads of female BALB/c mice.

  To further investigate the inhibitory function of CuE on human tumor metastasis,
  MDA-MB231-Luciferase (encodes Luciferase) tumor cells were injected into nude mice
  through tail vein.'
- MDA-MB231-Luciferase was tracked by an in vivo imaging system to monitor tumor metastasis.
- After 30 days, images of xenograft tumors were obtained using a Xenogen IVIS 2000
  Biophotonic Imager.
- The lung metastases in the treatment group significantly decreased by 70 % compared
  with those in the control group (Fig.

- In addition, body weight in control and treatment group remained relatively constant
  (Fig.

- This result demonstrated that CuE was a potential agent for inhibiting human breast
  tumor metastasis.
- CuE inhibits breast tumor metastasis to the lungs.

  To evaluate the possible effect of CuE on proliferation and apoptosis of inoculated
  4T1 and MDA-MB231 cells in vivo, we tested the expression of proliferating cell
  nuclear antigen (PCNA) and cleaved caspase-3 by immunohistochemistry analysis.'
- Both two proteins were widely considered as proliferation and apoptosis biomarker,
  respectively [32, 33].
- Our result showed CuE had little effect on cell proliferation and apoptosis of the
  4T1 primary tumor (Fig.
- 3a).
- This may explain why the volume of the primary tumors has no significant decrease
  in treated group.
- We next investigated whether CuE has an activity against proliferation and apoptosis
  of already disseminated breast tumor cells in the lung.
- Intriguingly, immunohistochemical analysis of PCNA and cleaved caspase-3 in lung
  sections (from spontaneous and experimental animal experiment) showed no significant
  difference between control and treated group (Fig.
- 3b, c).
- These results imply that CuE specifically target the process of dissemination of
  breast cancer cells from the primary tumor (tumor cell migration and invasion),
  but not the outgrowth of established micrometastases in target organs (lung, liver,
  etc.).
- CuE has no effects on apoptosis or proliferation of tumor cells in vivo.
- a, b To detect the inhibitory effect of CuE on tumor cell proliferation and apoptosis
  in spontaneous experiment of 4T1, primary tumors and lungs were sectioned and probed
  with anti-PCNA and anti-cleaved caspase-3 antibody.
- Representative images are shown (left panel), Brown color indicates positive cells.
- c In experimental metastasis model, lung sections were stained with anti-PCNA and
  anti- cleaved caspase-3 antibody.
- Representative images are shown (_left column_).
- '_Brown color_ indicates strong positive cells




  Our abovementioned in vivo data suggested CuE inhibit breast tumor metastasis by
  targeting tumor cell migration and invasion and we queried the effect of CuE on
  breast tumor cells in vitro.'
- We performed wound healing and transwell migration assays on 4T1 and MDA-MB231 cell
  lines, and CuE-treated group showed reduced migrated cell numbers in both two cell
  lines (Fig.
- 4a, b).
- Similar results were obtained in Matrigel-coated transwell invasion assay (Fig.
- 4c).
- We then studied cellular proliferation inhibitory potency of CuE using MTS assay.
- Neither 4T1 nor MDA-MB231 cells showed a marked decrease in proliferation under
  different concentration ranges as well as treatment time frames (Supplementary Fig.
- 1a).
- Western blotting assay of PARP, PCNA reinforced that CuE did not affect the apoptosis
  in breast cancer cell (Supplementary Fig.
- 1b).
- Altogether, our results showed that CuE possessed a stronger ability on tumor cell
  migration and invasion than on tumor cell proliferation and apoptosis, which further
  confirmed CuE suppresses tumor metastasis by targeting tumor cell migration and
  invasion.
- CuE inhibits breast cancer cell 4T1 and MDA-MB231 migration and invasion.
- a CuE inhibits 4T1 and MDA-MB231 migration.
- Tumor cells were seeded in six-well plates.

  through Matrigel.

- '_P_ &lt; 0.05,  _P_ &lt; 0.01,  _P_ &lt; 0.001 versus control




  Our data of CuE inhibiting breast cell migration and invasion raised the question
  of whether CuE affect cell cytoskeleton and lamellipodia which are key cellular
  events involved in cell motility and tumor metastasis [34, 35].'
- To explain the inhibitory effect of CuE on tumor cell migration and invasion, immunofluorescence
  assay in breast cancer cell was performed.
- We observed that focal adhesion (Paxillin staining) at the leading edge of migrated
  cells and polymerized actin (phalloidin staining) were reduced in CuE-treated cells
  (Fig.
- 5a).
- The driver of lamellipodia formation, Arp2/3 complex, is also one of the most important
  regulators of actin polymerization, and to be a control center for actin-based cell
  motility [36].
- In Arp2/3 complex, Arp3 is an actin-like subunit mediating polymerization of the
  daughter filament [37, 38].
- To further investigate the detail of CuE on breast cancer migration, we conducted
  Arp2/3-regulated actin polymerization assay in vitro.
- Our result showed, according to the manufacturer’s instruction, that addition of
  the CuE modestly inhibited Arp2/3-mediated actin nucleation activity in 10-min point
  [28], suggesting that CuE had some actin polymerization inhibitory activity (Fig.
- 5b left panel and quantified in the right panel).
- Additionally, our data of western blot first indicated that CuE reduced the Arp3
  expression of MDA-MB231 breast cancer cell in a dose- and time-dependent manner
  (Fig.
- 5c).
- To further confirm these results, MDA-MB231 cells stably overexpressed Arp3 were
  produced.
- Arp3-overexpressed MDA-MB231 cells were less responsive to CuE in disturbing actin
  polymerization compared with its mock counterpart (Supplementary Fig.
- 2).
- All above results suggested that CuE inhibits breast cancer cell migration and invasion
  by regulating the activity and expression of Arp2/3 complex.
- CuE disturbs tumor cell Arp2/3-dependent actin polymerization.
- a MDA-MB231 cells were seeded on gelatin-coated coverslips.
- After the indicated times (0, 1, 6, and 12 h), cells were fixed in PBS containing
  4 % paraformaldehyde, permeabilized using PBS containing 0.1 % Triton X-100, and
  stained for F-actin (lower, red) and Paxillin (_upper_, _green_).
- b CuE has some effect on Arp2/3 activity.
- a Time course of the actin polymerization reaction performed in the presence of
  GST-N-WASP VCA domain fusion protein (50 nM VCA, positive control) and CuE (0.2
  μM).
- Relative fluorescence units at the 10 min time point of a representative experiment
  were plotted to quantify the effects of CuE.
- Actin alone served as control.
- c Arp3 expression in MDA-MB231 was detected after incubation with CuE for the time
  frames indicated (_left panel_) and with different concentrations of CuE (_right
  panel_).
- GAPDH was used as loading control.
- 'The expression of β-actin decreased in a dose/time-dependent manner




  Previous reports have demonstrated a role for Src/FAK signaling in tumor cell invasion
  involving proteolytic degradation of the extracellular matrix by matrix-degrading
  metalloproteinase [26].'
- Recent studies have suggested that that inhibition of Src/FAK/Rac1 signal down-regulated
  MMP2 and MMP9 expression [39], and the positive correlation between the level of
  MMPs and tumor cell migration and invasion has been established [40].
- To evade primary tumor, tumor cells must interact with a broad range of factors,
  especially MMPs and TIMPs.
- Inhibition of MMPs by synthetic and natural inhibitors (TIMPs) can decrease tumor
  cell migration and invasion [41].
- To investigate whether CuE could suppress Src/FAK/Rac1/MMP signal pathway in tumor
  metastasis, we tested the phosphorylation or activation of proteins involved in
  this pathways.
- Our data showed that CuE robustly inhibited activated FAK, Src, Rac1, JNK, and c-jun
  in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.
- 6a).
- Additionally, we detected the expression of MMP2, MMP9, TIMP1, and TIMP2 in both
  cell lysates and primary tumor tissues.
- Furthermore, we checked the activity of MMPs in tumor cell conditioned medium and
  tissue lysates.
- Results showed that MMP2, MMP9 expression and activity decreased, whereas TIMP1
  and TIMP2 increased after CuE treatment (Fig.
- 6b, c).
- Based on all the results obtained, the Src/FAK/Rac1/MMP pathway may also be the
  potential pathway involved in the anti-tumor activation of CuE.
- CuE inhibits FAK/MMP-involved pathway.
- a MDA-MB231 cells were treated with different concentrations of CuE.
- After 6 h, cell lysates were blotted with specific antibodies (anti-phospho-FAK,
  anti-phospho-Src, anti-phospho-JNK, anti-phospho-Jun, FAK, Src, JNK, and c-Jun).
- Active Rac1 was pulled down using the GST-PBD fusion protein on glutathione beads
  and detected with anti-Rac1 antibody.
- GAPDH was the loading control.
- b MDA-MB231 cells were treated with different concentrations of CuE.
- After 24 h, cells were harvested, and western blot assay was performed to test the
  expression of MMP2, MMP9, TIMP1, and TIMP2.
- GAPDH served as loading control.
- MMP2 and MMP9 activity were detected using gelatin zymography analysis.
- c Western blotting and gelatin zymography analysis of MMP and TIMP in primary tumor
  tissues.
- Primary tumors were removed and then lysed in RIPA buffer.
- MMP2, MMP9, TIMP1, and TIMP2 were detected using western blot.
- GAPDH served as loading control.
- 'The activity of MMP2, MMP9 were checked using gelatin zymography analysis




  The current project was conducted to investigate the effect of CuE on breast cancer
  metastasis and elucidate its underlying mechanism.'
- Our data showed that CuE blocked breast cancer metastasis in vivo and suppressed
  tumor cell migration and invasion in vitro.
- CuE functioned as a tumor metastasis inhibitor by disturbing Arp2/3-dependent actin
  polymerization and blocking Src/FAK/Rac1/JNK/MMP signaling pathway.
- In animal models, using the safe dosage [42], CuE was shown to remarkably inhibit
  both human and mouse breast cancer metastasis to the lungs.
- Interestingly, primary tumor growth was not inhibited by CuE during the therapy
  in spontaneous animal model.
- Meanwhile, immunohistochemistry assay results showed CuE did not affect tumor cell
  proliferation and apoptosis in vivo.
- These results suggested CuE does not prevent the outgrowth of established micrometastases.
- Altogether, our data implied CuE suppresses breast tumor metastasis through blocking
  tumor cell migration and invasion (essential for tumor cell intravasation and extravasation).
- Tumor cell migration and invasion is a critical step during tumor metastasis, and
  inhibition of this step is a practical approach to antitumor treatment [43].
- Although we have no quantitatively assay to detect tumor cell migration and invasion
  in vivo, we took assays in vitro to support the anti-metastasis ability of CuE by
  targeting tumor cell migration and invasion.
- CuE was shown to inhibit MDA-MB231 and 4T1 cell migration and invasion under low
  concentration (IC50 &lt; 0.1 μM) (Fig.
- 3).
- Additionally, CuE did not inhibit both two tumor cell lines proliferation and apoptosis
  under the same treatment time and concentrations as migration and invasion assay
  (Supplementary Fig.
- 1).
- These results consist with in vivo experiment, suggesting breast tumor metastasis
  inhibition by CuE can be mainly ascribed to the impediments of tumor cell migration
  and invasion.
- Previous studies showed that CuE suppressed pancreatic tumor growth through cell
  cycle progression, apoptosis and proliferation inhibition [44].
- CuE also showed anti-prostate cancer activity by disrupting the actin and vimentin
  cytoskeleton [15].
- The potential reasons may be the different molecular mechanism in different cancer.
- An important finding of our study is that CuE inhibits tumor cell migration by impairing
  Arp2/3-dependent actin polymerization in breast cancer.
- Previous studies reported that CuE disturbed cytoskeleton in prostate cancer [15].
- Our immunofluorescence results showed that tumor cell branched actin polymerization
  and lamellipodia were impaired after CuE treatment (Fig.
- 5a).
- Arp3, a subunit of the Arp2/3 complex, is involved in actin polymerization and the
  formation of lamellipodia [27].
- We first showed, in present study, CuE decreased Arp3 and actin expression under
  low concentration (0.05 μM) (Fig.
- 5b).
- Previous studies revealed activated Rac1 stimulates actin polymerization through
  Arp2/3 complex [45].
- Our results demonstrated Rac1 activity was down-regulated by CuE.
- These findings suggested that CuE disturbed actin polymerization, cell migration
  and invasion through Arp2/3-dependent actin polymerization and further in vivo rescue
  studies in depth will be conducted later.
- FAK/MMP-involved pathway is essential for cancer invasion and metastasis [46, 47].
- Tumor cell invasion is a multistep process, of which the key cascades include increased
  migration and increased protease secretion to allow dissemination from primary tumor
  sites [48].
- CuE was found to inhibit FAK and c-Src phosphorylation activity and decrease the
  expression of FAK/c-Src downstream proteins including Rac1, JNK, and c-Jun, which
  are key components of cell migration and invasion (Fig.
- 6a).
- MMP2 and MMP9 up-regulation can particularly enhance tumor cell metastatic potential
  in breast cancer [49].
- MMP-2 and MMP-9 have been related to invasive behavior of tumors.
- On the other hand, TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 inhibit their activity and are therefore considered
  to have inhibitory effect on tumor metastasis [50, 51].
- In this study, CuE not only down-regulated MMP2, MMP9 expression and decreased their
  activity but also up-regulated the expression of TIMP1 and TIMP2 in cell lysates
  and primary tumors (Fig.
- 6b, c).
- The results suggested the efficacy of Src/FAK/Rac1/MMP signaling pathway blockade
  by CuE for the inhibition tumor cell invasion and metastasis.
- In conclusion, our results implied CuE is a potential agent in inhibiting breast
  cancer metastasis by targeting tumor cell migration and invasion.
