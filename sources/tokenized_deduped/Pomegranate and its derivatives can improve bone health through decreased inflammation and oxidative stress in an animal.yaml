- Recently, nutritional and pharmaceutical benefits of pomegranate (PG) have raised
  a growing scientific interest.
- Since PG is endowed with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities, we hypothesized
  that it may have beneficial effects on osteoporosis.
- We used ovariectomized (OVX) mice as a well-described model of postmenopausal osteoporosis
  to study the influence of PG consumption on bone health.
- 'Mice were divided into five groups as following: two control groups sham-operated
  and ovariectomized (OVX CT) mice fed a standard diet, versus three treated groups
  OVX mice given a modified diet from the AIN-93G diet, containing 5.7 % of PG lyophilized
  mashed totum (OVX PGt), or 9.6 % of PG fresh juice (OVX PGj) or 2.9 % of PG lyophilized
  mashed peel (OVX PGp).'
- As expected, ovariectomy was associated with a decreased femoral bone mineral density
  (BMD) and impaired bone micro-architecture parameters.
- Consumption of PGj, PGp, or PGt induced bone-sparing effects in those OVX mice,
  both on femoral BMD and bone micro-architecture parameters.
- In addition, PG (whatever the part) up-regulated osteoblast activity and decreased
  the expression of osteoclast markers, when compared to what was observed in OVX
  CT animals.
- Consistent with the data related to bone parameters, PG consumption elicited a lower
  expression of pro-inflammatory makers and of enzymes involved in ROS generation,
  whereas the expression of anti-inflammatory markers and anti-oxidant actors was
  enhanced.
- These results indicate that all PG parts are effective in preventing the development
  of bone loss induced by ovariectomy in mice.
- Such an effect could be partially explained by an improved inflammatory and oxidative
  status.

  Pomegranate (_Punica granatum_ L. Punicaceae), one of the oldest known edible fruits,
  represents a phytochemical reservoir with a high-potential medicinal value.'
- This fruit, grown mainly in the Mediterranean region, has been used for centuries
  to treat many ailments such as parasitic and microbial infections, ulcers, diarrhea,
  hemorrhage, and dysentery [1–3].
- This is why, over the past decade, the evaluation of nutritional and pharmaceutical
  benefits of pomegranate (PG) has raised a great scientific interest with more than
  600 publications now available on the subject.
- Pomegranate composition is very complex, and each part is built up with specific
  components.
- 'Indeed, the fruit can be divided in two parts: (1) the edible one, called the aril,
  comprising 78 % juice and 22 % seeds, which constitutes 52 % of the total fruit
  (w/w), and (2) the peel or pericarp, which is nonedible although it has been traditionally
  used in folk medicine [4].'
- A large array of phytochemicals has been identified in those two parts of PG, including
  polyphenolic compounds such as anthocyanins (cyaniding and delphinidin) in the juice
  and hydrolysable tannins (ellagic acid, punicalagin, gallagic acid) in the peel
  [4].
- Actually, the main benefit of PG has been attributed to its unique polyphenols composition
  [5].
- Indeed, PG polyphenols have been shown to exhibit high anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory
  capacities interesting for the prevention of several age-related diseases [6].
- In this light, the health benefits of PG consumption in preventing cancers [4] and
  cardiovascular diseases [7] have been widely focused.
- However, only a few studies have targeted the eventual benefice of PG consumption
  toward bone health [8–10], although in the present context of longer life expectancy,
  the prevalence of osteoporosis has been considerably increased.
- As a matter of fact, with more than 50 % of women and 20 % of men affected in the
  US population over 50-year old, osteoporosis, the most common bone disease, represents
  a major economic and public health issue [11], and this is true worldwide.
- This condition is characterized by a slow decline of bone mass and impaired micro-architecture
  leading to increased bone susceptibility to fracture [12, 13].
- Pathology establishment involves disruption of formation/resorption balance through
  uncoupling osteoblasts and osteoclasts activities (Gallagher and Sai 2010; Kular,
  Tickner et al.
- 2012).
- Besides, the literature has linked inflammation and oxidative status establishment
  with bone alteration, osteoclast bone resorption being promoted while osteoblast-mediated
  formation is inhibited [14, 15].
- Along with drugs ensuring bone homeostasis strategies, recent nutritional approaches
  have been developed and have revealed major interests for phenolic compounds such
  as flavonoids, anthocyanins, and tannins derived from vegetables and drinks (green
  tea, wine, etc.)
- '[16–18].'
- In this context, we investigated the effect of PG consumption on bone status.
- 'So far, most of the studies targeting PG health benefits have been focused on juice
  or purified peel polyphenol extracts: ellagic acid [19], punicalagin [20], and anthocyanins
  [21].'
- 'In our hand, we investigated the in vivo (in a murine model of postmenopausal osteoporosis)
  potential benefits of PG, in the context of osteoporosis prevention through different
  nutritional approaches: (a) juice, (b) peel, and (c) whole fruit.'
- The objective was to elucidate whether PG should be considered as one or as parts
  of new strategies to better contribute to bone health preservation.
- Pomegranates (the wonderful variety cultured in Israel) were purchased from POMONA
  (Clermont-Ferrand, France).
- Totum sample was prepared from the blended whole fruit (Philips HR2084, France)
  to obtain a homogenous mixture.
- Mashed peel was obtained following the same protocol as for the totum sample, separation
  of peel and arils being performed manually.
- Arils were squeezed, and juice was filtered through filter paper (Whatman filter
  paper Cat no.
- ': 1001–090, Grade 1: 11 μm, GE healthcare).'
- PG totum, juice, and peel used in the present study were analyzed for protein, free
  sugars, insoluble fiber, and polyphenols, see Table 1.
- Totum and mashed peel were dried using a freeze drier (CHRIST, Gamma 1–20, Germany).
- The yield of the lyophilized powder of the PG totum was 21.2 and 25.4 % from PG
  peel.
- All samples were frozen at −20 °C, directly after preparation and until diet formulation.
- 'All the animal procedures were approved by the institution’s animal welfare committee
  (Comité d’Ethique en Matière d’Expérimentation Animale Auvergne: CEMEAA) and were
  conducted in accordance with the European’s guidelines for the care and use of laboratory
  animals (2010-63UE).'
- The animals were housed in the animal facilities of the Human Nutrition Unit at
  INRA Research Center (http://​www1.​clermont.​inra.​fr/​unh/​telechargementin​ternet/​ienplaquette.​pdf)
  (Agreement no.
- C6334514).
- Surgery was performed under anesthesia, and all efforts were made to minimize suffering.
- Fifty-eight-week-old female C57BL/6J mice were purchased from JANVIER (St Berthevin,
  France).
- The animals were housed in a controlled environment (12:12 h light–dark cycle, at
  20–22 °C, with 50–60 % relative humidity), 1 mice per plastic cage fed ad libitum
  and with free access to water.
- After an acclimatization period of 1 week, they were randomly divided into 5 groups
  (_n_ = 10 per group).
- Two groups were surgically ovariectomized (OVX), while the other animals were sham-operated
  (SH), under anesthesia.
- The control mice (SH CT and OVX CT) were fed with a standard diet, modified from
  the AIN-93G powdered diet.
- PG groups were fed with the same standard diet, containing different amounts of
  PG parts.
- As far as the totum group is concerned (OVX PGt), 5.7 % of the PG lyophilized totum
  was added to the standard diet.
- With regards to the juice group (OVX PGj), 9.6 % of the PG fresh juice was added
  and 2.9 % of the PG lyophilized mashed peel was introduced into the diet for the
  peel group (OVX PGp).
- According to the human/mouse conversion principle [22], the experimental dose for
  PG juice (550 μL/mouse/day) in the present study was set equivalent to the corresponding
  nutritional dose of 250 mL for a 70-kg human subject.
- Then, the diet content of totum and peel from PG (nonedible parts) was calculated
  by considering the amount of fruit needed to achieve 550 μL of juice.
- In this light, daily quantity of PG given to the animals represented 1.4 g/mice/day
  of fresh totum (considering that juice = 37.5 % of the whole fruit) or 622 μg/mouse/day
  of fresh peel (based on the fact that peel = 42.4 % of the whole fruit).
- Diets were purchased from SAFE (Scientific Animal Food and Engineering, Augy, France).
- Body weight was measured every 2 days during the study period.
- Besides, body composition was assessed at the beginning and at the end of the study,
  using a QMR EchoMRI-900™ system, without any anesthesia or sedation.
- After the 30-day treatment was completed, blood was withdrawn under anesthesia and
  centrifuged (3,000 rpm for 5 min at room temperature).
- Serum was frozen at −80 °C.
- Then, the mice were killed.
- Liver, spleen, and uterus were weighted.
- Femurs and tibias were harvested and stored at −80 °C prior to investigation.
- After removing soft tissues, left femurs of the 14-week-old mice were placed in
  PBS buffer (Phosphate-Buffer Saline, Gibco) with 10 % formaldehyde at 4 °C for 1
  week.
- Micro-architecture (secondary spongiosa) was analyzed using X-ray radiation micro-CT
  (SkyScan 1072).
- Pictures of 1,024 × 1,024 pixels were obtained at 37 kV and 215 μA.
- Bone morphological analysis was performed using an eXplore CT 120 scanner (GE Healthcare,
  Canada).
- Acquisitions were processed with X-ray tube settings at 100 kV and 50 mA.
- For each experimental group, four sets of extractions were performed with two tibias
  pooled in each.
- Frozen bones were ground in liquid nitrogen to obtain a fine powder.
- Then, total RNA was extracted from either bone powder using TRIzol reagent (Life
  Technology), following the manufacturer’s instructions.
- RNA was converted to cDNA using the high-capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit
  (Applied Biosystems).
- Resulting cDNA was used for TaqMan® low-density arrays (TLDAs) (Applied Biosystems
  7900 HT real-time PCR system).
- Relative expression values were calculated using the comparative threshold cycle
  (2−ΔΔCT) according to Data Assist software (Applied Biosystems); 18 S, GAPDH, and
  actin served as housekeeping genes.
- Results are expressed as means with their standard error (SEM).
- All the data were analyzed using XLSTAT (ExcelStat Pro software—Microsoft Office
  2007) using a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to test for difference among
  groups.
- If the result was found to be significant (_p_ &lt; 0.05), the fisher’s multiple
  comparison test was then used to determine specific difference between means.
- During the experimental period, mean body weight, as well as lean and fat mass,
  increased in all the experimental groups, which reflects the health of the animals
  (Fig.
- 1a).
- Furthermore, no significant difference was observed among groups, which means that
  neither castration (SH CT vs OVX CT) nor the different diets (OVX PG vs. OVX CT)
  have had an impact on weight change.
- Nevertheless, ovariectomy was associated with a significant decrease in uterine
  weight, in all the four OVX groups (Fig.
- 1b).
- 'This atrophy was not prevented by PG consumption (% change compared to the values
  measured in the SH CT group: −72.6 % in OVX CT mice, −80.1 % in OVX PGt mice, −78.1
  % in OVX PGj mice, and −78.6 % in OVX PGp mice, _p_ &lt; 0.001).'
- The fruit is thus devoid of any uterotrophic effect at this physiological level.

- Animals were fed a standard diet AIN-93 (SH and OVX control) or the same standard
  diet modified from AIN-93, containing 5.7 % of PG lyophilized mashed totum (OVX

  The biological effect of ovariectomy and of the test systems has been studied was
  first investigated on bone morphological parameters, using micro-CT analysis.'
- We thus confirmed the deleterious effect of ovariectomy on femoral bone mineral
  density (BMD), the animals in the OVX CT group having a lower BMD (_p_ &lt; 0.001),
  when compared to what was measured in the SH CT mice (−35.6 %) (Fig.

  Pomegranate consumption was able to counter such an osteopenic process induced by

  PGt (+11.4 %), PGj (+27.1 %) (_p_ &lt; 0.001), and PGp (+16.2 %) (_p_ &lt; 0.05)).'
- Significant results were also observed on trabecular bone micro-architecture parameters
  of distal femur, as shown in Fig.
- 2b, c. As expected, ovariectomy significantly impaired bone micro-architecture,
  as shown by a decrease in trabecular number (TbN −25.0 %; _p_ &lt; 0.05), bone volume
  (BV/TV −23.6 %; _p_ &lt; 0.01), bone surface (BS/TV −23.9 %; _p_ &lt; 0.05), and
  connectivity (Conn Dn−19.7 %; _p_ &lt; 0.01) in the OVX CT, as compared with the
  SH CT one.
- Moreover, a significant increase in trabecular separation (TbSP +26.1 %; _p_ &lt;
  0.001) and in total porosity (Po tot +3.5 %; _p_ &lt; 0.01) was observed as well.
- 'Consistently with BMD data, PG was endowed with bone-sparing properties as its
  consumption partially prevented (_p_ &lt; 0.01) all these micro-architectural deteriorations
  induced by OVX: BV/TV (+27.8 %), TbN (+26.7 %), Conn Dn (+24.6 %), BS/TV (+22.4
  %), TbSP (−10.3 %), and Po tot (−3.0 %), when compared to what was measured in the
  OVX CT animals.'
- With regards to PGj and PGp, only a trend toward improved biomarkers was observed,
  without reaching significant values.
- To investigate the potential molecular mechanisms involved in the bone-sparing effect
  of PG, we performed transcriptomic analyses on bone tissue samples harvested from
  treated mice, using Taqman low-density arrays (TLDA).
- Due to the large amount of modulated genes, only results for the most important
  bone markers are presently given.
- Data from the OVX PG totum, juice, and peel groups were compared to those measured
  in the OVX CT animals.
- Consistently with data of bone phenotype, Fig.
- '3a indicates that ovariectomy (OVX CT) was associated with an up-regulation of
  two major osteoclastogenesis markers: the calcitonin receptor (CTR) for mature cells
  and the Fos for proliferating one (1.58-fold _p_ &lt; 0.001 and 1.61-fold, respectively,
  as compared to the SH CT group).'
- 'In this context, PG consumption, regardless of the part of the fruit which was
  given, significantly counteracted this effect, as demonstrated by the decreased
  expression of CTR and Fos in all the groups fed the PG diet (PGt: 0.48-fold; PGj:
  0.49-fold; PGp: 0.31-fold; _p_ &lt; 0.001 and PGt: 0.30-fold; PGj: 0.19-fold; PGp:
  0.20-fold; _p_ &lt; 0.001, respectively, as compared to the OVX CT animals).'
- 'Furthermore, the expression of the major integrin synthesized by mature and active
  osteoclasts (integrin β3; ITG β3) was significantly decreased in all the animals
  (PGt: 0.59-fold; PGj: 0.66-fold; PGp: 0.61-fold; _p_ &lt; 0.001).'
- 'In the same way, the expression of key enzymes for osteoclast activity involved
  in collagen degradation such as metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) was also significantly
  down-regulated in the OVX PG groups (PGt: 0.52-fold; PGj: 0.52-fold; _p_ &lt; 0.05;
  PGp: 0.48-fold; _p_ &lt; 0.001) as well as tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)
  expression was lowered, but only in the OVX PGp group (0.69-fold; _p_ &lt; 0.01),
  thus reflecting the inhibition of both osteoclast maturity and activity by the different
  PG studied parts.'
- Effect of PG consumption on specific bone markers expression in femurs.
- 'a, b Expression profile analysis of bone markers in femurs from OVX mice raised
  either under control conditions (SH CT_ first bar_, OVX CT_ second bar_) or exposed
  to different parts of PG added in the diet : 5.7 % in the diet of PG lyophilized
  mashed totum (OVX PGt_ third bar_) or 9.6 % of PG fresh juice (OVX PGj_ fourth bar_),
  or 2.9 % of PG lyophilized mashed peel (OVX PGp_ fifth bar_) for 30 days.'
- Transcriptomic analysis of bone tissue mRNA levels was determined by Taqman low-density
  arrays.
- Results are presented as fold change compared to what was observed in the OVX CT
  group (fold change = 1) and expressed as mean ± SD (_n_ = 8).

  On another hand, while ovariectomy (OVX CT) decreased the expression of osteoblast
  markers (0.44-fold compared to SH CT group; _p_ &lt; 0.001), as shown in the Fig.'
- '3b, TLDA analysis reveals that consumption of PG as the totum or as juice was associated
  with improved expression of a co-receptor implied in Wnt/β-catenin, one of major
  osteoclast signaling pathway: LRP5 (PGt: 1.86-fold, _p_ &lt; 0.001; PGj: 1.60-fold,
  _p_ &lt; 0.05 PGp: 1.19-fold compared with the OVX CT group).'
- Nevertheless, the other major osteoblast differentiation markers that have presently
  been investigated were not modified by any of the studied diets.
- To further conclude on the bone protective effect of PG linked to its consumption,
  we investigated the impact of PGt, PGj, and PGp on major inflammation and oxidation
  markers known to exacerbate bone resorption.
- Accordingly, a transcriptomic analysis of targeted inflammatory and oxidation markers
  was performed on bone tissue samples using TLDA, as previously described.
- As expected, ovariectomy (OVX CT) enhanced the inflammatory context in bone environment
  when compared to sham-operated animals (SH CT), as demonstrated by the increased
  expression of pro-inflammatory markers such as CCL2 (4.76-fold, _p_ &lt; 0.001),while
  the expression of IL1-R2 and IL1-Rn, 2 anti-inflammatory mediators, was reduced
  (0.62-fold, _p_ &lt; 0.01 and 0.51-fold; _p_ &lt; 0.001, respectively) (Fig.
- 4a).
- In contrast, consumption of each part of PG, and of the entire fruit by OVX mice,
  was able to prevent the establishment of such an inflammatory status measured in
  the OVX CT animals given the control diet.
- 'This protection occurred mainly through a down-regulation of CCL2 (PGt: 0.16-fold;
  PGj: 0.22-fold; PGp: 0.20-fold; _p_ &lt; 0.001) and IL1-R1 (PGt: 0.68-fold; PGj:
  0.68-fold; PGp: 0.56-fold; _p_ &lt; 0.001) and an up-regulation of IL1-R2 (PGt:
  3.40-fold; PGj: 3.76-fold; PGp: 3.31-fold; _p_ &lt; 0.001) and IL1-Rn expression
  (PGt: 1.72-fold, _p_ &lt; 0.05; PGj: 1.89-fold; PGp: 1.77-fold; _p_ &lt; 0.001).'

- Transcriptomic analysis of bone tissue mRNA levels was performed by Taqman low-density

  respectively, in the OVX CT animals compared to what was observed in the SH CT group),
  while expression of glutathione peroxidase: GPx and glutathione reductase: GSR (0.68-fold,
  _p_ &lt; 0.001; 0.41-fold _p_ &lt; 0.05, respectively, versus SH CT) was down-regulated.'
- Interestingly, consumption of PG, whatever the part, was able to enhance those bone
  anti-oxidant defenses in OVX mice.
- 'Indeed, an up-regulation of those antioxidant enzymes expression [GPx (PGt: 1.72-fold,
  _p_ &lt; 0.05; PGj: 1.72-fold; PGp: 1.46-fold; _p_ &lt; 0.001) and GSR (PGt: 4.76-fold;
  PGj: 3.92-fold; PGp: 5.47-fold; _p_ &lt; 0.001)] was measured, while, in contrast,
  the expression of ROS producing enzymes was down-regulated: NOS2 (PGt: 0.24-fold;
  PGj: 0.23-fold; PGp: 0.27-fold; _p_ &lt; 0.001) and NOX4 (PGt: 0.23-fold; PGj: 0.20-fold;
  PGp: 0.16-fold; _p_ &lt; 0.001), further supporting the bone-sparing effect of PG.'
- The present study demonstrates for the first time that PG (as well as its derivatives
  (peel and juice)) consumption may contribute to bone health during aging.
- Actually, all PG parts were able to prevent bone loss in a well-characterized model
  of postmenopausal osteoporosis by modulating bone cells differentiation, as well
  as inflammatory and oxidative status in bone microenvironment.
- First of all, to validate our experimental model, we assessed the effect of ovariecctomy
  on bone health.
- As a matter of fact, in comparison with what was observed in the SH CT group, the
  OVX control animals (i.e., fed the standard diet) exhibited decreased femoral BMD
  values and altered bone micro-architecture, as indicated by a lower number of trabeculae
  (TbN), decreased bone volume (BV/TV), bone surface (BS/TV), and connectivity density
  (ConnDn), in addition to a higher trabecular spacing (TbSp) and increased total
  porosity (Po tot) (Fig.
- 2).
- This is highly relevant to the human situation after menopause and consistent with
  the previous data [23, 24].
- With regards to the dietary intervention with PG and its derivatives, the present
  study carried out in OVX mice showed that consumption of any of the presently studied
  part of PG elicited a protective effect on both bone mass and bone micro-architecture,
  the two parameters mainly altered in osteoporosis.
- Actually, our results evidenced a greater potential of PG juice and peel in preventing
  BMD loss, while when given as a totum (OVX PGt), PG better counteracted bone micro-architecture
  impairment (Fig.
- 2c).
- Accordingly, our data are consistent with those previously published by Mori-Okamoto
  et al.
- '[25] showing that PG extracts from seed and juice exerted estrogen activities and
  improved bone parameters following ovariectomy.'
- Nevertheless, in the present study and in contrast to the previous work, PG consumption
  (whatever the part) exhibited a bone sparing not only by modulating bone histological
  parameters but also through regulation of cellular processes, as well as by improving
  bone inflammatory and oxidative status.
- Actually, PG is known for its large amount of phytochemicals and for the specific
  polyphenolic composition of its different parts, including anthocyanins (cyanidin,
  delphinidin, mainly in the juice) and hydrolyzable tannins in the peel such as ellagic
  acid, punicalagin, and gallagic acid [4].
- Among the great variety of those chemicals, punicalagin and ellagic acid seem to
  be the two important components of PG [5].
- It was raised that such a unique polyphenols composition could explain the potential
  of the PG to prevent various chronic diseases associated with aging, through its
  high anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory capacities [3, 26–28].
- 'In the present experiment, it appears that PG action could imply all its components:
  polyphenols (anthocyanins for the juice and ellagitannins for the peel), proteins,
  sugars, fibers, minerals, etc., although the relationship between the chemical constituents
  of PG and their pharmacologic effects is still not clear [6].'
- Accordingly, it appears crucial to investigate, like in the present study, the benefits
  of the whole fruit, considering the interactions between the various compounds in
  the PG matrix that could be of great importance for the final result [6].
- Nevertheless, we demonstrated here that the juice or the peel exhibited a better
  action on BMD than the totum.
- This could be due to molecules common to both parts such as ellagic acid or punicalagin.
- As a matter of fact, when considering the PG totum, those molecules could be less
  concentrated in the whole fruit, explaining that PG totum did not significantly
  impact BMD, although a trend was observed.
- As BMD mainly depends on hydroxyapatite content [29], such a result would suggest
  a greater calcium apposition rate in the animals given PG either under the peel-enriched
  diet or the juice, leading to a higher BMD.
- This is actually consistent with the recent published work by both [30] showing
  that a PG juice extract could increase calcium bone content during gestation in
  mice, even though a peel extract or a mixture of both were devoid of any significant
  effect.
- Inversely, we demonstrated that the whole fruit had a greater impact on bone micro-architecture
  parameters than the juice or the peel alone.
- This could be explained by the molecules present in PG totum such as seed compounds
  (punicic acid for example) that we do not find in other parts of the fruit.
- As micro-architecture parameters mainly result from better bone remodeling and expansion
  of osteoblast pool (by proliferation, recruitment, and/or increased survival) [29],
  we could suggest that PG totum improved osteoblastogenesis, leading to an improved
  micro-architecture.
- To further investigate cellular mechanism linked to such a bone rescue, the expression
  of the main markers for osteoblast and osteoclast differentiation and activity was
  analyzed.
- As expected, the osteopenia process induced by ovariectomy was associated with a
  down-regulation of osteoblast differentiation markers and an increase in osteoclast
  ones.
- With regards to present dietary interventions, we demonstrated that each part of
  PG was able to counteract such a bone loss in OVX mice (Fig.
- 3).
- Moreover, as inflammation and oxidative stress play a major role in bone remodeling
  by modulating bone resorption [15, 31], the expression of major markers of those
  processes was investigated in bone tissues (Fig.
- 4).
- In this light, our data dealing with the effect of ovariectomy control are consistent
  with previous publications [32].
- Indeed, we confirmed that ovariectomy enhanced inflammation and oxidative stress
  in bones with unbalanced expression of pro- and anti-inflammatory and oxidative
  stress markers [32].
- In this context, PG and its derivates were able to preserve this balance and consequently
  to prevent from excessive bone loss.
- Nevertheless, we must stay aware that this study presents some limitations.
- Biomechanical and histomorphometry analyses could strengthen our data.
- With regards to the expression analysis of major bone, oxidative stress, and inflammation
  markers, proteomic investigation would allow to confirm what was observed on gene
  expression thanks to TLDA assessment.
- In conclusion, those data suggest that PG may be used as an innovative alternative
  agent for the prevention of osteoporosis.
- However, further studies are now required to determine the detailed contribution
  of each nutrients, composing PG in mediating the observed bone-sparing effect, and
  to assess if those data, obtained in an animal model for the disease, can be extrapolated
  to the postmenopausal women.
- Nevertheless, further studies are required to fully determine the contribution of
  each PG parts properties on bone.
