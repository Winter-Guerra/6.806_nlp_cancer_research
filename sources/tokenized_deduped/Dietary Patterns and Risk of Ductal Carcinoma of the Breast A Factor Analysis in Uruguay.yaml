- Breast cancer (BC) shows very high incidence rates in Uruguayan women.
- The present factor analysis of ductal carcinoma of the breast, the most frequent
  histological type of this malignancy both in Uruguay and in the World, was conducted
  at a prepaid hospital of Montevideo, Uruguay.
- We identified 111 cases with ductal BC and 222 controls with normal mammograms.
- A factor analysis was conducted using 39 food groups, allowing retention of six
  factors analyzed through logistic regression in order to obtain odds ratios (OR)
  associated with ductal BC.
- The low fat and non-alcoholic beverage patterns were inversely associated (OR=0.30
  and OR=0.45, respectively) with risk.
- Conversely, the fatty cheese pattern was positively associated (OR=4.17) as well
  as the fried white meat (OR=2.28) and Western patterns (OR 2.13).
- Ductal BC shared similar dietary risk patterns as those identified by studies not
  discriminating between histologic type of breast cancer.
