- p53 has an essential role in preventing cancer development by inducing cell cycle
  arrest and/or apoptosis in response to cellular stress.
- Mutations in the p53 gene are described in over 50% of all human cancers.
- Besides the mutations, cellular aggregation of p53 can also inactivate the protein,
  leading to malignancy.
- Resveratrol, a natural polyphenol found in grapes and red wine, is able to induce
  p53-dependent cell death in a variety of cell lines.
- Although several indirect mechanisms of p53 activation by resveratrol have been
  proposed, there is no evidence that this bioactive compound can interact with p53.
- Thus, we investigated a possible interaction between resveratrol and the p53 core
  domain (p53C).
- In addition, we tested the potential of resveratrol in preventing wild-type and
  mutated p53 aggregation in vitro and in tumor cells.
- Experiments were performed by using fluorescence spectroscopy and fluorescence microscopy
  techniques.
- Our data suggest that an interaction between resveratrol and the wild-type p53C
  does occur.
- We also found that resveratrol has the ability to inhibit the wild-type p53 core
  domain as well as the R248Q p53 mutant to undergo in vitro aggregation.
- Additionally, resveratrol (50 and 100ÂµM) reduces the formation of nuclear p53 aggregates
  in MDA-MB231 human breast cancer cells.
- Our study provides evidence that resveratrol can directly modulate p53 and may pave
  the way for a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in p53 protein aggregation
  as a therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment.
