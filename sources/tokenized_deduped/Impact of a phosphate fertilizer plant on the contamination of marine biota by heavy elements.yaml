- Due to their toxicity, persistence, and bioaccumulation, metals are important marine
  environment pollutants, especially in low renewal rate water such as the Mediterranean
  Sea, receiving a lot of untreated industrial waste.
- The impact of a phosphate fertilizer plant on the marine biota metal contamination
  was studied.
- 'Several types of organisms: crabs, mussels, patella and fish were collected from
  two areas of the Lebanese coast, one subjected to the impact of the plant and another
  away from it; samples were analyzed for Zn, U, Cr, V, Mn, Ni, Co, Cu, As, Cd and
  Pb by ICP-MS. Higher accumulation was in crabs, patella, and mussels.'
- Fish accumulated principally Zn, Cu, and Cd; a difference was observed between species
  and tissues.
- Cytosol metal fractionation using size-exclusion LC-ICP-MS showed principally Pb,
  As, Co, and Mn in the low molecular weight fraction (&lt;1.8 Da); Cd, Zn, and Cu
  in the metallothionein fraction (1.8–-18 k Da), and Ni in high molecular weight
  fraction (&gt;20 kDa).
- The online version of this article (doi:10.​1007/​s11356-015-4691-4) contains supplementary
  material, which is available to authorized users.
- The very low renewal rate makes the Mediterranean Sea extremely sensitive to pollution.
- The decline of the Mediterranean threatens the health of many millions of people
  living on its shore and jeopardizes the long-term development of key economic sectors
  such as fishing and tourism (Haffner and Sommer 2008).
- This fact has led to initiatives to help the countries of the southern and eastern
  Mediterranean reduce the waste released into the sea.
- The key issue is the assessment of the present contamination linked to waste discharges
  from plants located at the seacoast.
- Heavy metals are normal constituents of the marine environment at trace levels,
  but their concentrations have been continually increasing due to domestic, industrial,
  mining, and agricultural activities (Uysal and Emre 2011).
- Discharges of heavy metals into the marine environment can change both aquatic species
  diversity and ecosystems (Funes et al.
- 2006).
- Because of their persistence, toxicity, and bioaccumulation, heavy metals may cause
  a risk to human and global ecosystem (Funes et al.
- 2006; Geeraerts and Belpaire 2009).
- On the other hand, some aquatic organisms such as, in particular, fish but also
  seaweeds and molluscs can be used to assess heavy metal contamination in the marine
  environment, since they accumulate metals to concentrations many times higher than
  those present in water or sediment (Silva et al.
- 2006).
- Studies have shown that metals accumulate in various organs of fish at different
  levels (Fernandes et al.
- 2007; Uluturhan and Kucuksezgin 2007).
- Heavy metals often accumulate to a higher concentration in the active metabolite
  parts such as the liver, gill, and kidney (Canli and Atli 2003).
- In general, the accumulation of heavy metals in a tissue is mainly dependent from
  water pollution level, time of exposure, intrinsic factors (fish age, feeding habits,
  metabolisms), and other environmental factors (salinity, pH, water temperature)
  (Canli and Atli 2003).
- Mussels, crabs, and patella are excellent metal biomonitoring species available
  throughout the year with great affinity to pollution and important accumulation
  capacities (Nesto et al.
- 2007).
- Thus, metal concentration in their tissues reflects environmental levels.
- A further insight into the toxicity, bioavailability, and environmental behavior
  of the metals can be obtained by the identification of the biomolecule targets involved
  in its metabolic pathways (Wallace et al.
- 2003; Vijver et al.
- 2004; Geffard et al.
- 2010).
- Indeed, the total accumulation of a metal in aquatic organisms may be insufficient
  to predict its toxicity since its various accumulated chemical forms are not biologically
  equally active (Vijver et al.
- 2004).
- For the toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics of metals, the cytosolic fraction was
  shown to be the most important (Perceval et al.
- 2006) since it contains both the metal-detoxified compounds (metallothionein-like
  proteins) and the metal proteins (Wallace et al.
- 2003; Perceval et al.
- 2006).
- In the Mediterranean countries, most of the industries are located at the seaside
  due to the need for cooling and transportation (Fakhri et al.
- 2008).
- The Lebanese coastal marine zone is intensely affected by several sources of heavy
  metal contamination, which discharge directly in seawater without any pretreatment.
- The objective of this study was to probe, for the first time, the direct impact
  of a phosphate fertilizer plant on the contamination of edible aquatic resources
  by heavy metals.
- The accumulation of U, Cr, V, Mn, Ni, Co, Cu, As, Cd, and Pb was investigated in
  the gill, liver, and kidney of five common fish species, in crabs, mussels, and
  patella samples, in terms of total metal concentration and molecular mass fractionation.
- Five commonly consumed fish species _Diplodus sargus_, _Oblada melanura_, _Pagellus
  erythrinus_, _Siganus rivulatus,_ and Redcoat squirrelfish (_Nylon_); crabs (_Portunus
  trituberculatus_); mussels (_Mytilus edulis sp._); and patella (_Patella vulgata_)
  were collected from two areas of the Lebanese coastal zone Selaata (34° 16′ 54.9″
  N; 35° 38′ 19.37″ E), an area subjected to the impact of a phosphate fertilizer
  plant and Jbeil (34° 07′ 50.0″ N; 35° 36′ 28.78″ E), away from the direct industrial
  impact.
- The collected samples were transferred to the laboratory in an ice box, rinsed with
  deionized water, and kept frozen until dissection.
- All fish samples were dissected with sterile scissors to separate gills, liver,
  and kidney; muscles of crabs, mussels, and patella were removed for analysis.
- Tissues from individuals of the same species were pooled together, lyophilized,
  and stored (at 4 °C) until analysis.
- All the solutions were prepared with high-purity deionized water (resistivity ≤
  18.2 Ω cm) obtained from a Milli-Q Elix 3 water purification system (Millipore,
  Molsheim, France).
- All chemicals and reagents were of the highest grade available from each supplier.
- The hydrogen peroxide, H2O2 (30 %), used was AnalaR NORMAPUR, HNO3 (70 %, INSTRA-ANALYZED)—from
  Baker (Deventer, The Netherlands)—and the protein standards were purchased from
  Sigma-Aldrich (St. Quentin Fallavier, France).
- A SPEX CertiPrep (Metuchen, NJ) PlasmaCAL mono-element standards of U, Th, Cr, V,
  Mn, Ni, Co, Cu, As, Cd, and Pb were used to prepare standard working solutions by
  diluting the stock solution of 1000 μg.g−1 of each element with 2 % nitric acid.
- 'DORM-2: Dogfish muscle certified reference material from the National Research
  Council of Canada was used.'
- Digestions were performed using a DigiPREP device (SCP Science, Courtaboeuf, France).
- One milliliter of hydrogen peroxide and 3 mL of conc.
- nitric acid were added to the weighed sample (50 mg) in a PE tube of 50 m; the cap
  was tightened and the tube placed in the instrument at 65 °C for 4 h. Digests were
  diluted to obtain a final concentration of 2 % HNO3 prior to total determination.
- Elemental analysis was conducted using an Agilent ICP-MS 7500ce (Agilent, Tokyo,
  Japan), fitted with an octopole reaction-collision cell.
- The operating conditions are given in Table 1.
- Single-element standard stock solutions PlasmaCAL (1000 ppm) were used for the calibration.
- The method has been validated by the analysis of a DORM-2 material.
- The cytosols were prepared from 50 mg of the gill, liver, and kidney tissues of
  the _S.
- rivulatus_ species, diluted in 2 mL of 100 mM ammonium acetate buffer (pH 7.4).
- The samples were sonicated with an ultrasonic probe (Branson Ultrasonics Corporation,
  Danbury, USA).
- Metal determination was performed in the supernatant (cytosolic fraction) after
  centrifugation (Thermo, CR3i multifunction centrifuge) at 32,000_g_ for 45 min at
  4 °C.
- An Agilent 1100 (Agilent, Wilmington, DE) liquid chromatography equipped with a
  binary HPLC pump, an autosampler, and a diode array detector were used.
- Detection was performed by ICP-MS with an Agilent ICP-MS 7500ce (Agilent, Tokyo,
  Japan).
- A Superdex 200 HR size-exclusion column (GE Healthcare, Orsay, France) with a mass
  separation range between 10 and 600 kDa was used at the operating conditions shown
  in Table 1.
- The column was calibrated with commercial solutions of thyroglobulin (670 kDa),
  ferritin (474 kDa), metallothionein (6–7 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), albumin
  (66 kDa), and Vit E/cobalamin (1.3 kDa).
- One hundred microliters of fish cytosol was injected and fractionated isocratically
  at 0.7 mL.min.−1 of 100 mM ammonium acetate (pH 7.4).
- UV absorbance was monitored at 280 nm.
- The Selaata phosphate fertilizer plant is located at the coast 46 km north of Beirut.
- The fertilizers are derived from phosphate ores which—in addition to phosphate minerals—contain
  a wide range of metals such as Hg, Cd, As, Pb, Cu, Ni, Cr, and Zn (Al-Masri et al.
- 2004; Aoun et al.
- 2010).
- 'During the production process, part of the contaminants is transferred from ores
  to finished products: phosphoric acid and fertilizers.'
- However, most of the contaminants are found in the effluents and mainly in the solid
  waste of the phosphate fertilizer industry, known as phosphogypsum (Al-Masri et
  al.
- 2004).
- Due to weathering processes, piles of phosphogypsum disposed without any treatment
  may lead to chemical contamination of the surrounding environment.
- In this study, fish belonging to five commonly consumed species and patella were
  caught all around the industrial area while crabs and mussels were collected from
  both sides (north and south) of the factory.
- 'Trace metal in marine environment can be divided into two classes: (i) those essential
  for effective function of biochemical processes (e.g., cobalt, copper, zinc, manganese)
  but toxic in excess and (2) those with no established biological functions and considered
  as toxic (e.g., cadmium, chromium, lead) (Kennish 2001).'
- The concentration levels of Pb, Ni, Cu, V, Cr, Cd, As, Zn, Mn, Co, and U in the
  liver, gill, and kidney of the investigated species were shown in Fig.
- 1
- Taking into consideration all the collected fish species from the two stations,
  the mean metal concentrations in the gill, liver, and kidney were, respectively,
  2.53, 1.52, and 0.87 mg.kg−1 for V; 0.74, 0.88, and 1.04 mg.kg−1 for Cr; 14.76,
  5.36, and 4.86 mg.kg−1 for Mn; 1.47, 2.76, and 1.77 mg.kg−1 for Ni; 0.88, 1.03,
  and 0.58 mg.kg−1 for Co; 3.32, 35.96, and 4.24 mg.kg−1 for Cu; 60.18, 164.15, and
  109.67 mg.kg−1 for Zn; 4.85, 8.76, and 7.75 mg.kg−1 for As; 3.18, 21.43, and 5.50
  mg.kg−1 for Cd; 3.51, 1.44, and 1.08 mg.kg−1 for Pb; and 0.34, 0.31, and 0.27 mg.kg−1
  for U.
- The overall metal accumulation capability of the studied fish organs decreases in
  the order liver &gt; gill &gt; kidney.
- Several previous studies approved that the liver is a target organ for metal accumulation
  and detoxification and can be considered as an important sample for the water pollution
  monitoring (Kljakovic et al.
- 2002; Canli and Atli 2003).
- 'Accumulation levels of a Zn, b Cu, c Mn, d Ni, e Cr, f Co, g Cd, h V, i As, j Pb,
  and k U in _Diplodus sargus_ (_1_ indicates the gill, _2_ the liver, and _3_ the
  kidney), _Pagellus erythrinus_ (_4_ indicates the gill, _5_ the liver, and _6_ the
  kidney), _Siganus rivulatus_ (_7_ indicates the gill, _8_ the liver, and _9_ the
  kidney), _Oblada melanura_ (_10_ indicates the gill, _11_ the liver, and _12_ the
  kidney), and _Nylon_ (_13_ indicates the gill, _14_ the liver, and 15 the kidney)


  The mean concentrations of essential elements in fish organs follow the sequence:
  Zn &gt; Cu &gt; Mn &gt;&gt; Co and Zn &gt; Cu − Mn &gt; Co &gt; in Selaata and Jbeil,
  respectively.'
- The concentrations of the toxic elements Cd, As, Pb, Ni, Cr, and U varied in a broad
  range between 0.3 mg.kg−1 for U and 92.5 mg.kg−1 for Cd in the fish organs.
- Concentrations of Ni and Cr are higher in fish collected from Selaata than from
  Jbeil showing a contamination of the area by the fertilizer plant.
- Results obtained for the molluscs are presented in Fig.
- 2
- As for fish, the concentrations of the three essential elements Zn, Cu, and, Mn
  in the analyzed crabs, mussels, and patella samples were the highest among those
  in the studied elements.
- There are higher levels of Ni and Cr in the molluscs than in fish organs that were
  observed, especially in mussel samples (Fig.
- 2).
- Related to other toxic elements, the highest levels of Cd obtained in mussels, crabs,
  and patella were 3.2, 9.7, and 5.3 mg.kg−1 in Selaata.
- Similarly, as for fish organs, high accumulation of V and As was observed in both
  regions while the high level of lead 13.5 mg.kg−1 was determined in mussels from
  Jbeil; this region away from the direct impact of the plant is surrounded by several
  other industries.
- 'Accumulation levels of Cu, Mn, Ni, Cr, Co, Cd, V, As, Pb, and U in molluscs; a
  crabs, b mussels, c patella




  It is an essential trace element which becomes toxic in excessive amounts.'
- Its concentrations in the studied fish organs varied between 44 and 360 mg.kg−1
  dry.
- In several studies, high accumulations of Zn were observed in fish organs, which
  is in agreement with our results as Zn was the most abundant metal in the studied
  organs of the fish.
- The lowest levels of Zn were observed in the gills even if for fish seawater is
  the main source of Zn, and some researchers indicated that gills are an important
  organ of its accumulation (Fernandes et al.
- 2007; Yilmaz and Yilmaz 2007).
- The levels found in this study in gills of _D.
- sargus_ and _S.
- rivulatus_ were several times lower than in the previous report of Uysal and Emre
  2011 (Tables 2 and 3), and high levels were observed in the liver organ; in fact,
  it was also reported that when the levels of Zn exceeded the requirement in the
  gills, the excess was excreted by the liver (Birungi et al.
- 2007), which is considered a detoxification organ.
- In this study, high accumulation of Zn was observed in the liver of _S.
- rivulatus_ and _Nylon_ and in the kidney of _D.
- sargus_ collected from Selaata industrial area compared to that from the area of
  Jbeil highlighting the impact of the phosphate industry.
- No effect of the sampling location was observed for organs of _O.
- melanura_ and _P.
- erythrinus_, although the concentrations found in the last species were slightly
  higher than in Turkish coastal water (Uluturhan and Kucuksezgin 2007; Dural et al.
- 2010).
- In fact, in addition to the water pollution level, metal concentrations are strongly
  dependent on fish species and other environmental factors (Canli and Atli 2003).
- Concentrations of Zn measured here in crabs, mussels, and patella were higher than
  those found in other areas (Table 4); Zn in patella samples were higher in our study
  even than in the contaminated area in Cravo studies (Table 4), which is an indicative
  of environmental pollution from industrial sources.
- "Heavy metal concentrations (mg.kg−1) found in the liver of _Pagellus erythrinus_
  \ \n\n\n\nHeavy metal concentrations (mg.kg−1) found in the gill of _Siganus rivulatus_
  and _Diplodus sargus_  \n\n\n\nHeavy metal concentrations (mg.kg−1) in marine organisms
  from different countries  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis essential element assuring healthy
  metabolism and growth of marine organisms becomes highly toxic at concentrations
  higher than the levels required for growth (Eisler 2000)."
- In this study, the concentrations of Cu in liver tissues were significantly higher
  than in the gill and kidney; data obtained by previous studies show that even at
  low levels, Cu show a distinct affinity to the liver organ (Jezierska and Witeska
  2006).
- 'However, the enrichment related to possible industrial contamination was observed
  for one species only: _S.'
- rivulatus_ with Cu values of 179 and 46 mg.kg−1 for Selaata and Jbeil, respectively.
- The values reported for _P.
- erythrinus_ liver were in the same range as those cited by (Uluturhan and Kucuksezgin
  2007; Dural et al.
- 2010) for the species sampled in Turkish coastal water.
- The levels of copper found in the gill were the same or slightly higher than those
  reported by (Uysal and Emre 2011) (Table 3) for _D.
- sargus_ and _S.
- rivulatus_, respectively.
- Cu in crabs and mussels from Selaata were higher than those found in other areas
  such as Kuwait bay, Adriatic Sea, and Venice lagoon (Table 4), which is an indicative
  of environmental pollution from industrial sources.
- The toxicity of this element is considered to be low (Kennish 2001).
- The fish organs contained between 0.7 and 26.6 mg.kg−1 in the kidney of _S.
- rivulatus_ in Selaata and in the gill of _S.
- rivulatus_ in Jbeil, respectively.
- The privileged organ for Mn accumulation in fish was the gill.
- The Mn in crabs and mussels were significantly higher reaching for some locations
  more than 100 mg.kg−1.
- The concentration of Mn found in the gill of _S.
- rivulatus_ and _D.
- sargus_ were slightly higher than those reported by Uysal and Emre 2011 (Table 3).
- The values reported for _P.
- erythrinus_ liver were in the same range as those found for the species sampled
  in Turkish coastal water (Uluturhan and Kucuksezgin 2007; Dural et al.
- 2010), which can be due to the fact that manganese levels in phosphogypsum are between
  3.5 and 20 mg.kg−1, low compared to other metal concentrations (Davister 1998).
- Chronic Ni toxicity to marine organisms was recently evaluated and found to be strongly
  species dependent (DeForest and Schlekat 2013).
- Levels of Ni in fish organs were relatively low in comparison to those of other
  metals studied and ranged from 0.5 to 4.4 in Selaata and 1.1 to 5.1 mg.kg−1 in Selaata
  and Jbeil, respectively.
- Similar levels were observed for crabs, patella, and mussels with the exception
  of mussels sampled in the south from the Selaata plant where the concentration as
  high as 18.4 mg.kg−1 was found.
- Toxicological impact can result both from the action of Cr (VI) itself as an oxidizing
  agent and from Cr (III) which is capable to form complexes with various organic
  compounds and thus may inhibit several metalloenzyme systems.
- In the studied fish organs, concentrations of Cr were at the level of a few mg.kg−1;
  the highest value (4.2 mg.kg−1) was obtained except for the liver of the _Nylon_
  sampled in Selaata.
- The same levels were present in crabs, mussels, and patella with the highest concentrations
  observed in the north of the Selaata plant.
- The content obtained in _P.
- erythrinus_ liver was in agreement with that observed (Dural et al.
- 2010) in Turkish coastal water.
- It is generally considered to present no or very low toxicity.
- 'In this study, no significant differences were observed for Co levels in the Selaata
  and Jbeil sampling sites; the highest concentrations in fish organs and molluscs
  were at the same level: 3.7 mg.kg−1 in the gill of _S.'
- rivulatus_ of Jbeil and 3.4 mg.kg−1 in mussel from Selaata.
- It is capable to produce chronic effects even at low levels (Taylor 1983).
- In the tissues, studied concentrations of Cd were generally below 10 mg.kg−1 for
  both fish and molluscs with the exceptionally high values observed for _S.
- rivulatus_ liver in Selaata (92.5 mg.kg−1) and in Jbeil (29 mg.kg−1).
- It was shown that the liver is the primary target for Cd accumulation; the levels
  in Selaata were generally higher than in Jbeil.
- Cadmium levels observed in the liver of _P.
- erythrinus_ were significantly higher than those reported in previous works on the
  same species sampled in Turkish coastal areas (Uluturhan and Kucuksezgin 2007; Dural
  et al.
- 2010); it was reported in previous studies that cadmium is taken by to the gills
  and distributed throughout the body and accumulates in the liver for detoxification
  (Uluturhan and Kucuksezgin 2007) which may explain this difference, showing a contamination
  of the area by the plant.
- Cd, in patella, were higher in our study than in others studies, even than in contaminated
  area in Cravo studies (Cravo and Bebianno 2005).
- The pH is an important modulator of V toxicity.
- No clear link was established between the sampling location and vanadium levels
  with the exception of the organs of _D.
- sargus_ where the concentrations in Selaata were significantly higher than in Jbeil.
- On the basis of the obtained data, the accumulation of vanadium seems to be strongly
  species dependent for both fish and molluscs.
- Toxicity of this trace element is highly species dependent; however, in marine biota,
  most of arsenic is known to be present in the form of harmless organic species such
  as arsenobetaine.
- Similar to vanadium, the accumulation of As was found strongly species dependent
  with no clear correlation with the sampling location.
- Out of the fish organs studied, the livers contained the highest levels of As up
  to 14.6 mg.kg−1 in the liver of _O.
- melanura_ from Jbeil.
- The concentrations found in molluscs were significantly higher reaching 44.8 mg.kg−1
  for crabs.
- It is a non-essential element which causes toxic effects (Garcia-Leston et al.
- 2010).
- Distribution of Pb was similar between the different organs of both _P.
- erythrinus_ and _O.
- melanura_ species, and a similar accumulation was observed in _D.
- sargus_ species from both regions.
- The highest levels were generally observed in the gills, with the highest concentration
  of 10.2 mg.kg−1 found in the gill of _Nylon_ from Jbeil.
- Lead levels observed in the liver of _P.
- erythrinus_ were at the same level as those reported in the work of Uluturhan and
  Kucuksezgin 2007 and Dural et al.
- 2010 for the same species sampled in Turkish coastal areas.
- Previous studies have reported low levels of Pb in seawater, and fish bioaccumulates
  Pb proportionally to its concentrations in seawater, or Pb concentrations in phosphogypsum
  are low compared to the levels of other metals (0.5–17 mg.kg−1) (Davister 1998),
  which may explain in our study the low levels of Pb compared to those of other metals
  in fish organs.
- Uranium is a non-essential element, with documented chemical and radiological toxicity
  (Al Kaddissi et al.
- 2011).
- The levels observed in both fish and molluscs were generally low (with a maximum
  of 0.6 mg.kg−1 in the gill of _S.
- rivulatus_ from Selaata) with no significant differences in the levels for the different
  organs and species studied.
- Levels of U in marine organisms from Selaata were higher than from Jbeil.
- When compared with other studies, the observed difference in distribution of the
  studied elements between organs of the different species in this study is in agreement
  with that in the previous studies on other fish species (Kljakovic et al.
- 2002; Yilmaz and Yilmaz 2007).
- Metal concentrations were strongly dependent on fish species which is reported to
  may be related to the differences in ecological needs, swimming behaviors, and the
  metabolic activities of the different species (Canli and Atli 2003).
- Few studies exist on metal levels in the chosen fish species; based on the obtained
  data, the _S.
- rivulatus_ species has almost the highest levels of Co, Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb, and U; _D.
- sargus_ had the highest levels of V and Ni; _Nylon_ had the highest levels of Cr;
  and the highest levels of As and Mn were observed in the _O.
- melanura_ and _P.
- erythrinus_ species, respectively.
- 'The concentrations were higher in crabs: levels of 2715, 167, 158, and 52 mg.kg−1
  were observed for Zn, Cu, Mn, and As, respectively.'
- Accumulation in patella samples was lower; the highest concentration found was 841.5
  mg.kg−1 for Zn while U had the lowest level of 0.2 mg.kg−1.
- The comparison of data obtained for fish showed that metal concentrations varied
  between the sampling locations.
- For instance, significant Mn concentration was found in Jbeil, while those of Zn,
  Cu, and Cd were in Selaata.
- The highest metal concentrations in molluscs were generally found in Selaata, except
  for V, Ni, and Mn which were concentrated in Jbeil samples.
- The levels of heavy metals in patella collected from Jbeil and Selaata were comparable.
- In general, the concentrations of metals in fish organs in Selaata were higher than
  those in Jbeil, which may be due to the impact of the phosphate fertilizer industry
  in this area.
- Phosphate loading activities and phosphogypsum storage are considered as the main
  sources of Zn, Cu, and Cd which can be leached to the surrounding environment (Al-Masri
  et al.
- 2004; Aoun et al.
- 2010).
- The high levels of some elements found in the species from Jbeil, such as Cd and
  Mn concentrations, may have anthropogenic origin.
- This area is highly populated with considerable agricultural and metallurgic industry
  activities.
- Pearson test was performed to find the intercorrelation between the organs of the
  collected fish samples.
- The linear correlation between each pairs of organs based on the Pearson correlation
  factor (two-tailed sigma, _p_ = 0.05) (Weiss 2008) showed significant linear relations
  between the gill, liver, and kidney for V and Cd in Selaata sample (_p_ &lt; 0.05),
  also between the liver and kidney for Cu and Cr (_p_ = 0.023, _p_ = 0.0001) and
  between gill–liver for U, As, and Pb (_p_ = 0.04, _p_ = 0.00, _p_ = 0.012).
- Few significant correlations between organs were observed in the fish species collected
  from Jbeil, mainly between the gill, liver, and kidney for As; gill–kidney for U;
  and liver–kidney for Pb (Annexe 2).
- The linear correlation between each pairs of elements based on the Pearson correlation
  factor (two-tailed sigma, _p_ = 0.05) showed strong correlations between many elements
  in the three organs of fish samples collected from Selaata, especially in the liver
  (Annexe 2).
- For instance, Zn correlates positively with Ni, Cu, Cd, and U with Pb while strong
  correlations were observed between Ni, Cu, Co, and Cd.
- These correlations are absent in the case of Jbeil which allows to attribute the
  origin of these metals to the phosphate plant.
- For the assessment of toxicity, mobility, and bioavailability of the studied metals,
  their molecular size fractionation was investigated further to their total determination.
- The experiments were focused on the cytosolic fraction of the liver, gill, and kidney
  of the _S.
- rivulatus_, which contains the highest levels of metals.
- 'The species eluting from the size-exclusion column were divided into three metal–ligand
  pools: (i) high molecular weight fraction (HMW) (245–18 kDa), from 12 to 22 min;
  (ii) metallothionein-like protein fraction (MTLP) (18–1.8 kDa) in the range of 22–30
  min; and (iii) lower molecular fraction (LMW) (&lt;1.8 kDa) after 30 min as shown
  in Fig.'
- 3
- Most of the metals were bound to several species, e.g., Cd binds to different protein
  fractions, mainly to MTLP in the liver and gill and low molecular weight species
  in the kidney (Annexe 3).
- Surprisingly, only a small fraction of the cytosolic Cu was bound to MTLP in the
  liver, kidney, and gill of the _Siganus rivulatus_ from both Jbeil and Selaata.
- As showed in Fig.
- 3, Cu was preferably bound to the LMW fraction, which increased with the concentration
  of Cu in the liver samples of _Siganus rivulatus_ from Selaata.
- This highlights a high contamination and healthy effect.
- Indeed, ecotoxicological studies have shown that MTLP are detoxifier proteins whereas
  HMW and LMW would be biomarkers of harmful effects (Giguère et al.
- 2003).
- Arsenic, cobalt, and lead were found predominantly in the low molecular fraction,
  whereas a significant fraction of nickel (up to 72 % depending on the organ) was
  bound to high molecular proteins.
- Data have shown a heavy contamination of marine biota directly related to the phosphate
  plant activity in Selaata, especially for Zn, Cu, and Cd which are contained in
  the coproduct and industrial waste of the factory.
- The contamination is species dependent.
- The highest metal concentrations were found in the livers (organ of detoxification)
  of the studied fish species.
- The concentrations of Zn in all organs were the highest.
- The metals were relatively homogenously distributed among the pools of biological
  ligands which suggest that the levels of contamination exceed those at which molecular
  mechanisms are still active.
- We would like to thank the Lebanese National Council of Scientific Research for
  their support to achieve this work and the laboratory of Analytic Bio-inorganic
  Chemistry and Environment LCABIE CNRS/UPPA, France.
