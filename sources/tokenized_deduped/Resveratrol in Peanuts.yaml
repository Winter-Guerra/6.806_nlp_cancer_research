- Peanuts are important dietary food source of resveratrol with potent antioxidant
  properties implicated in reducing risk of cancer, cardiovascular and Alzheimer's
  disease, and delaying aging.
- Resveratrol is a naturally occurring stilbene phytoalexin phenolic compound produced
  in response to a variety of biotic and abiotic stresses.
- This paper is a review of trans-resveratrol and related stilbenes from peanutsâ€”their
  chemical structures, mechanisms for their biosynthesis, and concentrations in comparison
  with other major food sources.
- It will also discuss trans-resveratrol's absorption, bioavailability, and major
  health benefits; processes to enhance their biosynthesis in peanuts by biotic and
  abiotic stresses; process optimization for enhanced levels in peanuts and their
  potential food applications; and methods used for its extraction and analysis.
