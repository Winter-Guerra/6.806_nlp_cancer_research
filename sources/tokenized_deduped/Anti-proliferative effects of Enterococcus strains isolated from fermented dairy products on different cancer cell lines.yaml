- Among the lactic acid bacteria, _Enterococcus_ strains can be utilized as probiotic
  and preservative agents.
- _Enterococcus_ strains from traditional Iranian dairy products were isolated, identified
  by sequencing 16s rDNA gene, and biologically characterized in this study.
- Primary assessments, including low pH and high bile salt tolerance tests and experiments
  on antagonistic activity against pathogens and antibiotic susceptibility, verified
  the probiotic property of strains.
- The secreted metabolites from the strains and Taxol, as an anti-cancer drug, were
  analyzed through MTT assay to investigate their cytotoxicity in different cancer
  (MCF-7, HeLa, HT29, and AGS) and normal human (HUVEC) cell lines.
- Results revealed the anticancer characteristics of the secreted metabolites of _E.
- durans_ 39C against all cancer cell lines, similar to Taxol.
- The metabolites did not exhibit cell toxicity in the normal cell line.
- Fluorescent microscopy and flow cytometry confirmed that apoptosis is the main cytotoxic
  mechanism of _E.
- durans_ 39C secretion metabolites.
