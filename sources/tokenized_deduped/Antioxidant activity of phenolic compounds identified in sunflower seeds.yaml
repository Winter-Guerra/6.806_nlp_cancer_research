---
- The antioxidant activity and phenolic compound profiles of six fractions (I–VI)
  obtained from sunflower seed extract were studied.
- HPLC–MS(ESI) analysis was applied for quantitative and qualitative determination
  of phenolic compounds of the fractions.
- The antioxidant activity of the fractions was studied in terms of their ability
  to scavenge DPPH· and ABTS·+ and to reduce Fe3+/ferricyanide complex to the ferrous
  form and was expressed as EC50, TEAC and reducing power values, respectively.
- The results of all antioxidant activity tests showed good correlations among each
  other and with the phenolic contents for the individual fractions.
- The fractions IV–VI were characterized by high antioxidant activity.
- 5-_O_-Caffeoylquinic acid was a predominant compound of fractions IV and V, while
  dicaffeoylquinic acid isomers and caffeoyl-dimethoxycinnamoylquinic acid isomers
  accounted for 76.6 % of phenolic compounds of fraction VI.
- Ferulic acid, _p_-coumaroylquinic acid isomers, ferulic acid dehydrotrimer isomers
  and some quercetin derivatives were also identified.
- The highest content of those compounds was noted in fraction III.

  Antioxidants are applied in food industry as additives limiting oxidation of food
  components, especially lipids.'
- The oxidation leads to losses in food quality and shelf life [1].
- The antioxidants play an important role also in living organisms since they prevent
  excessive free radical formation in cells.
- The extent of free radicals may cause disruption of biologically imported molecules,
  and in consequence the onset of various diseases.
- It is believed that oxidative processes are among the reasons for deficiency of
  immunological system and increased risk of infectious diseases, cancer development,
  diabetes, arthritis, rheumatoid diseases, respiratory diseases, cataracts, atherosclerosis
  and a series of destructive processes due to aging, schizophrenia and Alzheimer’s
  disease [2].
- Fruits and vegetables are important sources of antioxidants.
- Among dietary plant products, sunflower seeds are characterized by high antioxidant
  potential [3, 4].
- Sunflower is an important oleaginous plant grown in many European countries.
- The antioxidant compounds are present in both sunflower oil and oilseed-extracted
  meal [5].
- Extracts with high antioxidant activity may also be obtained from sunflower seed
  shells [6, 7].
- Compared to vegetables oils, sunflower oil is especially rich in α-tocopherol [5].
- The antioxidant potential of defatted sunflower meal and sunflower seed shells is
  determined mainly by the content of phenolic compounds [5, 6].
- However, it has to be mentioned that shells contain only 0.7–5.4 % of sunflower
  seed phenolics, whereas the rest is located in kernels [8].
- It has been estimated that sunflower cake, by-product of oil extraction, contains
  as much as 2–4 % of phenolic compounds [9, 10].
- For this reason, meal prepared from press residues might become a valuable source
  of antioxidants for application in food technology.
- Up to date, sunflower by-product has been primarily used as ruminant feed due to
  its high protein content [11].
- One of the chlorogenic acid isomers—5-_O_-caffeoylquinic acid—is the predominant
  phenolic compound in sunflower kernel [9, 12].
- This compound comprises 43–73 % of phenolic compounds extracted from kernels [8,
  10].
- The attempts to identify the other phenolic compounds present in sunflower seeds
  were made in the 1970s [9]; however, the techniques used at that time did not allow
  the identification of those compounds.
- The most commonly used approach involved liberation of individual compounds from
  ester and glycosidic bonds and then their analysis [13].
- The identification of native forms of phenolic compounds present in sunflower seeds
  became possible in the recent years, especially after popularization of LC/MS methods
  [8, 10, 12].
- Until now, researchers using this technique analyzed sunflower seed phenolic compounds
  directly in aqueous methanolic, aqueous ethanolic or acetonitrile crude extract.
- Our study aimed to obtain fractions of phenolic compounds from the extract of dehulled
  sunflower seeds using Sephadex LH-20 column chromatography, to identify phenolic
  compounds in the fractions and to determine their antioxidant activity.
- Sunflower seeds (_Helianthus annuus_) of non-oil type served as a plant material
  for extraction of phenolic compounds.
- Dehulled sunflower seeds (sunflower kernels) were purchased in a specialized local
  shop in Olsztyn (Poland).
- All chemicals used were of analytical or HPLC grade.
- Sephadex LH-20, 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH), [2,2′-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic
  acid)] diammonium salt (ABTS), 6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethyl-chroman-2-carboxylic
  acid (Trolox) and standards such as (+)-catechin and 5-_O_-caffeoylquinic acid were
  obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Poznań, Poland).
- _trans_-Ferulic acid and quercetin rutinoside were from Extrasynthese (Genay, France),
  and quercetin glucuronide from PhytoLab (Vestenbergsgreuth, Germany).
- The other solvents and reagents, if not otherwise specified, were acquired from
  P.O.Ch.
- (Gliwice, Poland).
- The sunflower kernels were ground in a coffee mill (BSH Bosch &amp; Siemens, Munich,
  Germany) and defatted with hexane using a Soxhlet apparatus.
- A 25-g portion of defatted flour was weighed into dark glass bottles and suspended
  in 200 mL of 80 % (v/v) aqueous methanol and shaken at 60 °C for 15 min in a water
  bath (Elpan, Lubawa, Poland).
- The cooled supernatant was filtered, and the residue was extracted twice more.
- Methanol from the combined filtrates was evaporated under vacuum at 40 °C (Rotavapor
  R-200, Büchi Labortechnik, Flawil, Switzerland), whereas water residue was lyophilized
  for ~48 h at −70 °C and 0.013 mbar (Lyph Lock 6 freeze dry system, Labconco, Kansas
  City, USA).
- The extraction was carried out in triplicate.
- A suspension of the extract (1 g in 8 mL of methanol) was loaded onto a column filled
  with Sephadex LH-20 gel (2 × 60 cm).
- The chromatographic separation was performed using methanol as a mobile phase, which
  was delivered to the column by a LKB 2132 MicroPerpex peristaltic pump (Pharmacia
  LKB, Uppsala, Sweden) at a flow rate of 0.7 mL/min.
- The void volume of the eluate _V_ 0 = 240 mL was discarded, and then 10 mL of fractions
  was collected using a RediFrac fraction collector (Pharmacia LKB).
- The individual fractions were analyzed by absorbance measurement at λ = 320 nm and
  after reaction with Folin–Ciocalteu’s reagent (FCR)—the absorbance of the products
  formed was recorded at λ = 725 nm using a spectrophotometer DU-7500 (Beckman Instruments,
  Fullerton, USA).
- Subsequently, based on the prepared chromatograms of separation, the eluates were
  combined into six main fractions, and methanol was evaporated using a rotary evaporator.
- The TPC of the main fractions was determined using reaction with FCR [14].
- Briefly, to 0.25 mL of methanolic solutions of fractions, 0.25 mL of FCR (diluted
  twofold), 0.5 mL of saturated solution of sodium carbonate and 4 mL of water were
  added.
- After a 25-min quiescent period, the reaction mixture was centrifuged (MPW-210,
  MPW Med.
- Instruments, Warsaw, Poland) for 5 min at 5,000×_g_, and the absorbance of supernatants
  at λ = 725 nm was read using a DU-7500 spectrophotometer.
- (+)-Catechin and 5-_O_-caffeoylquinic acid were used to prepare the standard curves.
- The results were expressed as milligram of standard equivalents (eq) per gram of
  fraction.
- The samples were dissolved in 80:20 (v/v) methanol/water, filtered through a 0.45-μm
  cellulose acetate filter (Millipore, Billerica, USA) and analyzed using a Waters
  HPLC system (Milford, USA) consisting of an autoinjector, a quaternary pump, a 2001
  photodiode array detector (PDA) and Millenium 32 chromatography manager software.
- The samples were injected into a Nova-Pak C18 column (3.9 × 300 mm; particle size,
  4 μm; Waters) and eluted for 110 min in a gradient system consisting of solvent
  A, water/acetic acid (98:2 v/v), and solvent B, water/acetonitrile/acetic acid (78:20:2
  v/v/v).
- 'The gradient profile was the following: 0–55 min, 100–20 % A; 55–70 min, 20–10
  % A; 70–80 min, 10–5 % A; and 80–110 min, 100 % B.'
- The flow rate was 1 mL/min and injection volume 30 μL.
- The column was re-equilibrated between sample injections with 10 mL of acetonitrile
  and 25 mL of mobile phase A.
- The diode array detection was performed by scanning over a wavelength range from
  210 to 400 nm at an acquisition of 1 s. The quantification of individual compounds
  was carried out using a calibration curve of the corresponding standard or, when
  reference compound was not available, of structurally related substances.
- Samples were analyzed in duplicate.
- The mass spectra were obtained using a Hewlett Packard Model 1100 Series LC/MSD
  system (Palo Alto, USA) equipped with an electrospray ionization (ESI) interface.
- The solvent gradient and column employed were identical to those for HPLC-PAD analyses.
- 'The ESI conditions were as follows: N2 was used both as the nebulizing gas at 275
  kPa and as drying gas (flow rate, 10 L/min; temperature, 340 °C); voltage at the
  capillary entrance, 4,000 V; and variable fragmentation voltage, 100 V (_m/z_ 200–1,000)
  and 250 V (_m/z_ 1,000–2,500).'
- Negative-ion mass spectra of the column eluate were recorded from _m/z_ of 100 to
  _m/z_ of 2,500.
- DPPH·-scavenging activity of individual fractions was measured according to the
  method described by Yen and Chen [15].
- From methanolic solutions of fractions at a concentration of 1 mg/mL, 0.1 mL was
  pipetted into the tube containing 0.25 mL of 1 mM methanolic solution of DPPH and
  2 mL of methanol.
- The mixture was vortexed immediately (Vortex Genie2, Scientific Industries INC.,
  Bohemia, USA) and allowed to stand at 20 °C in the darkness for 20 min.
- Then, the absorbance at λ = 517 nm was recorded.
- 'The ability to scavenge the DPPH radical was calculated using the following equation:
  scavenging effect (%) = [(_A_ 0 − _A_ 1)/_A_ 0] × 100, where _A_ 0 is the absorbance
  of the DPPH solution and _A_ 1 is the absorbance in the presence of the sample.'
- Scavenging effect versus concentration of fractions (mg/assay) was plotted.
- The EC50 value, defined as the amount of antioxidant (mg) necessary to inhibit the
  initial DPPH· by 50 %, was read from the plot.
- The TEAC of fractions was determined using the ABTS radical cation decolorization
  assay [16].
- ABTS·+ was prepared by reaction of 192 mg ABTS and 33 mg potassium persulfate in
  50 mL water.
- The mixture was stirred overnight in the darkness at room temperature; afterward,
  the solution was diluted with methanol up to a final absorbance of 0.70 ± 0.02 at
  734 nm.
- Two milliliters portions of ABTS·+ was vortexed with 20 μL of methanolic solution
  of fractions.
- Samples were incubated at 30 °C using a block heater (TH-24, Meditherm, Warsaw,
  Poland), and the absorbance was recorded at λ = 734 nm after 6 min, strictly.
- Trolox was used to obtain the standard curve.
- The results were expressed in mmol of Trolox eq/g of fraction.
- The reducing power was determined according to the method of Oyaizu [17].
- The fraction solutions (1.0 mL, 0.2–1.0 mg/mL) were mixed with 2.5 mL of phosphate
  buffer (0.2 M, pH 6.6) and 2.5 mL of potassium ferricyanide (1 %).
- Then, the mixture was incubated at 50 °C for 20 min (TH-24, Meditherm).
- Following this, a portion of trichloroacetic acid (2.5 mL, 10 %) was added.
- A 2.5 mL of the aliquot was mixed with 2.5 mL of distilled water and 0.5 mL of 0.1
  % ferric chloride.
- The absorbance of the mixture was recorded at λ = 700 nm.
- The absorbance versus concentration of fractions (mg/assay) was plotted.
- The mean values and standard deviations (_n_ = 3) for all conducted analysis were
  calculated using Microsoft Excel 2000 software (Microsoft Office Excel for Windows,
  Microsoft Co., Redmond, USA).
- The linear correlation coefficients between the total phenolic content and antioxidant
  activity were calculated by Pearson test using GraphPad Prism version 5.02 for Windows
  (GraphPad Software, San Diego, USA).
- TPC and TEAC values were analyzed by a one-way ANOVA statistical model with Tukey’s
  post hoc test.
- Differences were considered significant at _P_ &lt; 0.05.
- The phenolic compounds from sunflower seed crude extracts were fractionated into
  six fractions (I–VI) (Fig.
- 1).
- The yield of separated fractions in the extract and the total phenolic content of
  fractions are given in Table 1.
- The maximum optical density determined after reaction with FCR for fraction I was
  higher than for the other fractions.
- In turn, when detection was carried out at 320 nm, the highest optical density value
  was noted for fraction V. Fraction I accounted for 58.4 % of extract; however, it
  was characterized by a very low content of phenolic compounds amounting to 18.2
  mg (+)-catechin eq/g only.
- Since crude extract of sunflower seeds was obtained using aqueous methanol, besides
  phenolic compounds, also soluble sugars might have been extracted.
- The carbohydrates are eluted from Sephadex LH-20 column chromatography with methanol
  at the beginning of separation [18].
- Amarowicz et al.
- '[19, 20] and Arfan et al.'
- '[21] noted low content of phenolic compounds in the first fractions obtained from
  chromatographic separation of crude extracts of legume seeds and _Litsea monopetala_
  bark on Sephadex LH-20.'
- "Separation of sunflower seed crude extract using Sephadex LH-20 column chromatography;
  _FCR_ Folin–Ciocalteu’s reagent\n\n\nYield of sunflower seed fractions and total
  phenolic content of individual fractions  \n\n\n\nMeans with different superscript
  letters (a–f), within a column, are significantly different at _P_ &lt; 0.05\n\nFractions
  II–VI were characterized by high total phenolic content (Table 1)."
- The highest content was noted for fractions IV and V, 470 and 485 mg (+)-catechin
  eq/g, respectively.
- The yields of those fractions were also appreciable.
- They accounted for 8.5 and 8.9 % of the total weight of extract, respectively.
- Generally, the total phenolic content of fractions II–VI was several times higher
  in comparison with fractions obtained from canola [18], everlasting pea, faba bean,
  broad bean [22], pea [19] and lentil seeds [20].
- Since phenolic compounds of sunflower seeds comprise mainly 5-_O_-caffeoylquinic
  acid [8–10], the results of total phenolic content were additionally expressed as
  5-_O_-caffeoylquinic acid eq (Table 1).
- The results obtained in that manner were approximately 1.4 times higher in comparison
  with those expressed as (+)-catechin eq.
- A significant correlation (0.978; _P_ = 0.0007), as determined by the Pearson test,
  was found between the content of phenolic compounds determined by FCR assay and
  sum of individual phenolic compounds quantified by HPLC–MS(ESI) (Table 2).
- "Pearson’s correlation coefficients between total phenolic content (TPC), sum of
  phenolic compounds determined by HPLC–MS(ESI) and data obtained in antioxidant activity
  tests of sunflower seed fractions  \n\n\n\n\n\nIn Table 3, the λmax of UV spectra
  and characteristic ions of phenolic compounds identified in the sunflower seed fractions
  are presented."
- The _trans_-ferulic acid, 5-_O_-caffeoylquinic acid, quercetin rutinoside and quercetin
  glucuronide (compounds 1, 5, 29, 30) were identified by comparison of their retention
  times and UV spectra with respective reference substances.
- The _cis_-ferulic acid (2) was identified in agreement with data from Dueñas et
  al.
- '[23].'
- "λmax of UV spectra and characteristic ions of phenolic compounds detected in fractions
  of sunflower seeds  \n\n\nThe presence of 5-_O_-caffeoylquinic acid (5) was confirmed
  by HPLC–MS(ESI) analysis."
- This compound, present in all analyzed fractions, showed a deprotonated molecular
  ion [M–H]− at a _m/z_ of 353, main fragment ion at a _m/z_ of 191 (quinic acid moiety)
  and a fragment ion at a _m/z_ of 179 (caffeic acid moiety) with low intensity, which
  is in accordance with literature data [24, 25].
- Compounds 3 (fraction VI) and 4 (fractions III–VI) produced similar parent ion at
  a _m/z_ of 353 corresponding to the molecular formula C16H17O9.
- Since main fragment ions of those compounds were at a _m/z_ of 191 and a _m/z_ of
  179 (compounds 3) and a _m/z_ of 173 (compounds 4), they were assigned to 3-_O_-caffeoylquinic
  acid and 4-_O_-caffeoylquinic acid, respectively, taking into account the different
  intensity of the fragment ions [24, 25].
- The parent ion at a _m/z_ of 337 was characteristic of compounds 6, 7, 8.
- They were identified as 3-_O_-_p_-coumaroylquinic acid (fractions II–V), 4-_O_-_p_-coumaroylquinic
  acid (fraction III) and 5-_O_-_p_-coumaroylquinic acid (fraction III), due to the
  presence of the main fragment ions [_p_-coumaric acid—H]− at a _m/z_ of 163, [quinic
  acid—H2O–H]− at a _m/z_ of 173 and [quinic acid—H]− at a _m/z_ of 191, respectively
  [24].
- 'The presence of four monoacyl quinic acids (out of six isomers detected in the
  present study) was noted in sunflower seeds in previous analyses: three isomers
  of caffeoylquinic acid and 5-_O_-_p_-coumaroylquinic acid [8, 10, 12].'
- However, to our knowledge, 3-_O_-_p_-coumaroylquinic acid and 4-_O_-_p_-coumaroylquinic
  acid were identified as sunflower seed phenolic compounds for the first time.
- Six compounds 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14 exhibiting a [M–H]− ion at a _m/z_ of 515
  and fragment ions such as [M–caffeoyl]− at a _m/z_ of 353, [M–2 caffeoyl]− at a
  _m/z_ of 191, [caffeic acid—H]− at a _m/z_ of 179, [quinic acid—H2O–H]− at a _m/z_
  of 173 and [caffeic acid—CO2H]− at a _m/z_ of 135 were assigned to dicaffeoylquinic
  acid isomers [25].
- Aramendia et al.
- '[12] and Weisz et al.'
- '[10] reported the presence of three dicaffeoylquinic acid isomers among phenolic
  compounds of sunflower seeds.'
- They were identified as 3,4-di-_O_-caffeoylquinic, 3,5-di-_O_-caffeoylquinic and
  4,5-di-_O_-caffeoylquinic acids.
- In turn, Pedrosa et al.
- '[8] noted the presence of four dicaffeoylquinic acid isomers in sunflower seeds:
  three aforementioned, and the other was presumably 1,5-di-_O_-caffeoylquinic acid.'
- The fragment ion at a _m/z_ of 335 in the compounds 12 and 13 suggested the presence
  of the isomers 1,3-di-_O_-caffeoylquinic and 1,4-di-_O_-caffeoylquinic, reported
  by Clifford et al.
- '[25].'
- The compound 20 present in fraction II was identified as one of the caffeoylferuloylquinic
  acid isomers on the basis of [M–H]− ion at a _m/z_ of 529 and fragment ion at a
  _m/z_ of 193 (ferulic acid moiety) [24].
- Among diacyl quinic acids, the presence of five caffeoyl-dimethoxycinnamoylquinic
  acid isomers was noted in sunflower seeds.
- Isomers 15 and 16 were detected in fractions II–IV, and isomers 17, 18 and 19 in
  fractions IV–VI.
- The identification was performed on the basis of the occurrence of deprotonated
  molecular ion [M–H]− at a _m/z_ of 543 and fragmentation of the parent ion, which
  was in accordance with literature data [26].
- Heretofore, caffeoyl-dimethoxycinnamoylquinic acid isomers were not recognized as
  phenolic compounds of sunflower seeds.
- Compounds 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 and 26 were tentatively identified as related to ferulic
  acid dehydrotrimers.
- These compounds displayed a UV spectrum characteristic of ferulic acid-related structures,
  a fragment ion at a _m/z_ of 193 (ferulic acid moiety) and an ion [M–H]− at a _m/z_
  of 563 which could correspond to different dehydrotriferulic acids [27].
- In previous study on sunflower seeds phenolic compounds, Pedrosa et al.
- '[8] noted the presence of compound showing a parent ion at a _m/z_ of 563 with
  fragmentation yielded ions at _m/z_ of 353, 191 and 179, but the authors did not
  identify the structure of that compound.'
- 'Among non-esterified phenolic compounds, only _trans_ and _cis_ isomers of ferulic
  acid (compounds 1 and 2, respectively) were identified in the fractions: _trans_-ferulic
  acid in fractions I–III, and _cis_-ferulic acid in IV–VI.'
- Weisz et al.
- '[10] detected two non-esterified phenolic acids such as caffeic and ferulic using
  HPLC–DAD/ESI-MSn analysis, whereas Pedrosa et al.'
- '[8] additionally found trace amounts of _p_-coumaric, _p_-hydroxybenzoic, protocatechuic
  and syringic acids by RP-HPLC analysis.'
- In the fractions from sunflower seeds, a few compounds belonging to flavonoids were
  also identified.
- Compounds 27 and 28 due to the characteristic λmax of UV spectra and fragment ion
  at a _m/z_ of 301 (quercetin moiety) were classified as quercetin derivatives, with
  compound 28 being probably a diglycoside, but no further identifications were possible.
- Fraction IV contained the quercetin rutinoside (29) (_m/z_ 609, 301), and in fractions
  V and VI, one of quercetin glucuronide isomers (30) was identified due to the occurrence
  of deprotonated molecular ion [M–H]− at a _m/z_ of 477 and fragment ion at a _m/z_
  of 301 (quercetin moiety) [28].
- Furthermore, in fraction IV, a flavanone (compound 31) with λmax of UV spectrum
  at 290 and 332 nm was tentatively identified.
- The contents of individual phenolic compounds identified in fractions of sunflower
  seeds are presented in Table 4.
- The 5-_O_-caffeoylquinic acid was the predominant compound in fractions I, II, III,
  IV and V. It accounted for 89.0, 94.9, 85.1, 93.4 and 95.8 % of the sum of phenolic
  compounds identified in individual fraction, respectively.
- However, the content of 5-_O_-caffeoylquinic acid in those fractions varied from
  6.98 to 308.9 mg/g.
- It was calculated that 5-_O_-caffeoylquinic acid present in fraction IV and V amounted
  to 47.6 mg/g of extract, which accounts for 76.1 % of total amount of that compound
  eluted from sunflower seeds extract loaded on Sephadex LH-20 column.
- The other fractions contained from 1.4 to 5.2 mg of 5-_O_-caffeoylquinic acid per
  gram of extract.
- The estimated content of 5-_O_-caffeoylquinic acid is in accordance with the literature.
- Weisz et al.
- '[10] noted that this compound might comprise from 66 to 73 % of phenolic compounds
  extracted from defatted kernels of non-oilseeds and oilseeds of sunflower.'
- Pedrosa et al.
- '[8] obtained more diversified results ranging within 43–71 % for kernels of different
  genotypes.'
- In the present study, 5-_O_-caffeoylquinic acid was not the only predominant compound
  in fraction VI.
- That constituent accounted for 18.2 % of the sum of phenolic compounds of that fraction.
- Diacyl quinic acids dominated in fraction VI.
- They comprised 76.6 % of the sum of phenolic compounds of fraction VI.
- Among them, one of the dicaffeoylquinic acid isomers (79.74 mg/g of fraction) and
  one of the caffeoyl-dimetoxycinnamoylquinic acids (61.69 mg/g of fraction) were
  predominant.
- Weisz et al.
- '[10] showed that the ratio of monocaffeoylquinic acids content to dicaffeoylquinic
  acids content for sunflower kernels ranged from 5.6:1 to 16.9:1.'
- The ratio of those compounds in our study was 17.5:1.
- The majority (75.8 %) of ferulic acid dehydrotrimer isomers was noted in fraction
  III.
- This fraction contained also the highest amount of flavonoids and _p_-coumaroylquinic
  acid isomers.
- "Content of identified phenolic compounds in fractions of sunflower seeds (mg/g
  of fraction)  \n\n\nDPPH·-scavenging activity of sunflower seed fractions is shown
  in Fig."
- 2
- The fractions III–VI at the highest concentration (0.1 mg/assay) inactivated more
  than 90 % of DPPH radicals.
- In turn, fractions I and II were much weaker scavengers of DPPH·.
- The amount of the fraction necessary to inhibit the initial DPPH· by 50 % (EC50
  value) was the lowest for fraction VI and amounted to 0.024 (Table 5).
- Fraction V was characterized by similar EC50 value, whereas fractions III and IV
  by higher values.
- In the assay conditions, fractions I and II inhibited DPPH radicals by less than
  50 %.
- The ABTS cation radical-reducing ability of sunflower seed fractions was expressed
  as TEAC values and compiled in the Table 5.
- 'The TEAC values varied from 0.10 mmol Trolox eq/g for fraction I to 2.21 mmol Trolox
  eq/g for fraction V, and the ABTS·+-reducing capacity was increasing in the following
  order: I &lt; II &lt; III ≤ VI ≤ IV &lt; V (_P_ &lt; 0.05).'
- The highest reducing power, similarly as the capacity to scavenge ABTS·+, was noted
  for fraction V (Fig.
- 3).
- Fractions IV and VI showed comparable ability to reduce Fe3+/ferricyanide complex
  to the ferrous form in the whole range of concentration/assay.
- The reducing power determined for fractions I, II and III was lower in comparison
  with fractions V by 11, 4 and 1.5 times, respectively.
- The results of all applied methods of antioxidant activity testing were significantly
  correlated with the content of phenolic compounds in fractions (Table 2).
- High Pearson’s correlation coefficients were noted also between TEAC, reducing power
  and EC50 values (Table 2).
- "Scavenging effect of sunflower seed fractions on 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl
  radical (DPPH·)\n\n\nABTS·+scavenging activity expressed as Trolox equivalent antioxidant
  capacity (TEAC) and DPPH·-scavenging activity expressed as EC50 values of sunflower
  seed fractions  \n\n\n\nMeans with different superscript letters (a–e), within a
  column, are significantly different at _P_ &lt; 0.05\n\n\n\nSince 5-_O_-caffeoylquinic
  acid is a major phenolic constituent of fractions I–V (Table 4), their antioxidant
  activity (Table 5; Figs."
- 2, 3) can be attributed to this compound.
- It is well known that 5-_O_-caffeoylquinic acid is able to scavenge free radicals
  and inhibit oxidation of various lipid substrates [29].
- Its antioxidant activity is comparable to or only slightly lower (depending on the
  method used) than the activity of caffeic acid and significantly higher than other
  hydroxycinnamic acids [29–32].
- It is determined by the structure of 5-_O_-caffeoylquinic acid, which similarly
  to caffeic acid contains two –OH groups bound to an aromatic ring in the _ortho_
  position.
- It is known that a catechol group in flavonoid and phenolic acid structures is essential
  for their free radical-scavenging and metal chelating activities [33].
- Consequently, it is not surprising that dicaffeoylquinic acids, containing two catechol
  groups in the structure, are characterized by higher antioxidant activity than that
  of chlorogenic acid [31, 34].
- On the other hand, Kim et al.
- '[34] compared antioxidant activity of five various dicaffeoylquinic acid derivatives
  that have non-esterified –OH groups in catechol structures.'
- These compounds were characterized by similar (not statistically significant differences)
  DPPH·-scavenging activity and inhibition of formation of cholesteryl ester hydroperoxide
  during copper ion-induced rat blood plasma oxidation.
- Therefore, the activity of those compounds is not connected with the presence or
  absence of the olefinic double bond or with the binding position of caffeic and
  dihydrocaffeic acids to the quinic acid [34].
- In our study, dicaffeoylquinic acid isomers were present mainly in fraction VI (Table
  4), and it seems that those compounds mainly determined the high antioxidant activity
  and reducing power of this fraction (Table 5; Figs.
- 2, 3).
- The second group of compounds abundant in fraction VI was caffeoyl-dimethoxycinnamoylquinic
  acid isomers (Table 4).
- To the best of our knowledge, the antioxidant activity of those compounds has not
  been studied so far.
- It seems that due to esterification of –OH groups in the catechol structure, they
  might exert lower antioxidant effect than caffeoyl-dimethoxycinnamoylquinic acid
  isomers.
- On the other hand, high correlations between the sum of phenolic compounds in fractions
  and the results of antioxidant tests (Table 2) might be indicative of possible high
  antiradical activity and reducing power of caffeoyl-dimethoxycinnamoylquinic acid
  isomers.
- In the presented study, we fractionated crude extract of sunflower seeds using Sephadex
  LH-20 column chromatography with methanol as a mobile phase.
- This step enabled us to identify and quantify phenolic compounds that were not noted
  before in sunflower seeds.
- Until now, researchers identified non-esterified phenolic acids, isomers of caffeoylquinic
  acid, _p_-coumaroylquinic acid and dicaffeoylquinic acids in sunflower seeds [8–10,
  12, 13].
- In our research, we additionally found new isomers of coumaroylquinic acid (probably
  3-_O_-_p_-coumaroylquinic and 4-_O_-_p_-coumaroylquinic acids) and dicaffeoylquinic
  acids (probably 1,3-di-_O_-caffeoylquinic and 1,4-di-_O_-caffeoylquinic acids).
- Moreover, caffeoyl-dimethoxycinnamoylquinic acid isomers and few compounds belonging
  to flavonoids were tentatively identified.
- The results of ABTS, DPPH and Fe3+/ferricyanide assays showed good correlations
  between each other and with phenolic content of individual fraction of sunflower
  seeds.
- The determination of antiradical activity and reducing power of individual fractions,
  containing different types of phenolic compounds, enables the conclusion that not
  only predominant 5-_O_-caffeoylquinic acid contributes to the high antioxidant activity
  of sunflower seeds, but also isomers of dicaffeoylquinic acid and caffeoyl-dimethoxycinnamoylquinic
  acid.
- It seems that this information can be useful for utilization of sunflower cake,
  by-product of oil extraction, as functional food component or as antioxidant supplement.
