- Although there is some evidence suggesting that olive oil could reduce breast cancer
  (BC) risk, the epidemiological data are still relatively limited, not entirely consistent
  and mainly based on case-control studies.
- Therefore, we prospectively assessed the association between olive oil and BC risk
  in postmenopausal women from the Mediterranean cohorts within the European Prospective
  Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition.
- The analysis included 62,284 postmenopausal women recruited from Spain, Italy and
  Greece who had complete dietary data (collected from validated country-specific
  dietary questionnaires).
- The risk of BC (overall and by hormone receptor subtypes) was assessed using hazards
  ratios (HRs) obtained from Cox proportional hazards regression, while adjusting
  for known BC risk factors.
- After a mean follow-up of 9 years, 1,256 women were diagnosed with a primary incident
  invasive BC.
- The multivariate HRs for BC risk by olive oil intake (highest _vs_.
- lowest tertile of g/day/2,000 kcal) were 1.07 (95% CI = 0.91-1.25) in the adjusted
  model, 1.06 (95% CI = 0.91-1.24) in the model additionally adjusted for reproductive-related
  factors and 1.10 (95% CI = 0.92-1.31) for the model additionally adjusted for dietary
  factors.
- There was no association between olive oil and risk of estrogen or progesterone
  receptor-positive tumors, but a suggestion of a negative association with estrogens
  and progesterone receptor-negative tumors.
- The results from our prospective study showed that olive oil consumption during
  adult life was not associated with the risk of BC.
- However, larger prospective studies are still needed to explore possible differences
  related to hormone receptor status.
- Olive oil is the principal source of lipid within the traditional Mediterranean
  diet,1 and its regular consumption is related to a reduced risk of several chronic
  diseases2 attributed to its high monounsaturated fat content and concentration of
  polyphenolic compounds in virgin and extravirgin olive oil.2 There is some epidemiological
  and experimental evidence suggesting that olive oil might reduce the risk of certain
  cancers, in particular breast cancer (BC).3-5 A recent systematic review pooled
  the results of six case-control studies and reported a significant 38% reduction
  in BC for the highest level of olive oil consumption.4 However, the largest case-control
  study within this review, set in Italy, did not observe a significant association
  for the upper quintile of olive oil intake, although a significant association was
  found for each 30 g/day increment.6 In a study focused on the Mediterranean diet,
  the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Greece cohort7
  reported a negative nonsignificant association.
- As the epidemiological data on olive oil and BC are not entirely consistent and
  mainly based on case-control studies, we prospectively assessed the association
  between olive oil intake during adult life and BC in the Mediterranean countries
  of the EPIC.
- This study included 63,955 postmenopausal women recruited from the Mediterranean
  countries of EPIC (Spain [_n_ = 22,273], Greece [_n_ = 12,642] and Italy [_n_ =
  29,040]), with a high but varied olive oil intake.
- The rational and details of the EPIC design have been described previously.8 Briefly,
  information on sociodemographic characteristics, lifestyle and reproductive factors
  and medical history was collected using lifestyle questionnaires.
- 'Validated country-specific questionnaires were used at recruitment to record the
  usual diet during the previous year.8


  BC cases were identified using population cancer registries in Italy and Spain.'
- In Greece, an active follow-up of study participants and next-of-kin was implemented
  by means of telephone interviews and self-reported information on incident cancer
  was subsequently verified through pathology and medical reports, discharge diagnoses
  or death certificates.
- Cases were defined as women with a primary incident invasive BC (C50 using International
  Classification of Diseases for Oncology).
- Information on participants' receptor status, as well as the available laboratory
  methods and quantification descriptions used to determine receptor status, was collected
  using the same techniques to collect incident BC cases.
- Information on receptor status was not available for two of the five Spanish centers
  (Granada and Murcia).
- 'To standardize the quantification of receptor status received from the different
  centers, the following criteria for a positive receptor status were used: ≥10% cells
  stained, any "plus-system" description, ≥20 fmol/mg, an Allred score of ≥3, an IRS
  ≥2 or an H-score ≥10.9 This information was used to categorize BC cases according
  to hormone receptor status.10 The estrogen receptor status, the progesterone receptor
  status and the combined status of the tumor could be assessed for 69, 67 and 67%
  of the cases, respectively.'
- From the initial cohort, 1,671 women were excluded because of lack of dietary and
  lifestyle data or implausible dietary data (defined as top and bottom 1% of ratio
  of total energy intake to basal metabolic rate).
- Olive oil intake was assessed using tertiles of consumption based on the energy
  density method (g/day/2,000 kcal of energy excluding energy from alcohol).
- The association between BC and olive oil was assessed using Cox proportional hazards
  regression models, with age at recruitment as the entry time and exit time defined
  for cases as age at first BC diagnosis, and for controls as age at death, diagnosis
  of cancer apart from BC or last complete follow-up.
- 'Models were stratified by age and center and adjusted for known potential BC confounders
  (categorized as in Table 1): educational level, BMI, height, physical activity,
  smoking status, alcohol consumption and energy intake.'
- As additional adjustment for reproductive-related factors (age at menarche, first
  full-term birth and menopause and use of hormone replacement therapy [HRT] and oral
  contraceptives) or dietary factors (fruit, vegetables, meat and saturated fat) had
  negligible effect, these variables were not included in subsequent models.
- Separate models were created for estrogen or progesterone receptor-positive tumors
  (ER+/PR+) and estrogen and progesterone receptor-negative tumors (ER− and PR−).
- The Wald statistic was used to assess heterogeneity by hormone receptor subtypes.
- Stratification was used to evaluate possible effect modification by BMI (&lt;25
  kg/m2 _vs_.
- ≥25 kg/m2) or HRT use (yes _vs_.
- no).
- Likelihood ratio tests were used to assess interaction between these subgroups.
- Finally, we explored the association between BC and olive oil as a percentage of
  total fat (expressed as tertiles), while additionally adjusting for energy from
  total fat and from carbohydrates and protein.
- 'BC: breast cancer; BMI: body mass index; CI: confidence interval; EPIC: European
  Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition; ER+/PR+: estrogen receptor-positive
  or progesterone receptor-positive; ER− and PR−: estrogen receptor-negative and progesterone
  receptor-negative; HR: hazards ratios; HRT: hormone replacement therapy




  During a mean follow-up of 9 years, 1,256 primary incident invasive BC cases were
  identified.'
- The mean olive oil intake was 24.7 g/day (SD = 15.8 g/day), the interquartile range
  was 14.2-32.9 g/day and 4.6% were nonconsumers.
- The intake of olive oil by baseline characteristics (Table 1) shows that women with
  a higher intake were more likely to be overweight/obese, less likely to take oral
  contraceptives or to smoke, drank less alcohol, consumed fewer calories and meat,
  but more total fat, vegetables and fruit.
- The multivariate hazards ratios (HRs) for BC risk by olive oil intake (highest _vs_.
- lowest tertile) were 1.07 (95% CI = 0.91-1.25) in the adjusted model and 1.06 (95%
  CI = 0.91-1.24) and 1.10 (95% CI = 0.92-1.31) in the models, respectively, additionally
  adjusted for reproductive-related and dietary factors (Table 2).
- No association was observed between olive oil and ER+/PR+ tumors; however, there
  was a suggestion of a negative association for ER− and PR− tumors, although the
  test of heterogeneity was not significant (_p_ = 0.195).
- There was a positive association between olive oil and BC in HRT users, but no association
  was observed in HRT never users.
- In further analyses (data not shown), there was no association between BC and the
  ratio of olive oil to total fat (HR = 1.10, 95% CI = 0.94-1.28, for upper _vs_.
- lower tertile).
- Consumption of olive oil during adult life was not associated with overall BC in
  this cohort study; however, there was a suggestion of a potentially beneficial effect
  in ER− and PR− tumors.
- This result, although in line with previous research showing that the negative association
  between the entire Mediterranean diet or other dietary factors and BC was more pronounced
  in hormone receptor-negative tumors,11, 12 needs to be interpreted with caution
  as this subgroup analysis was only based on 129 cases.
- Surprisingly, there was an increased BC risk in HRT users; however, a dose response
  was not evident, and there were fewer cases in this subgroup analysis.
- Our overall results conflict with previous findings from case-control studies,4,
  5 which generally show that consuming olive oil relates to an important decrease
  in BC risk.
- However, as case-control studies can be prone to information and selection bias
  and olive oil is an indicator of a healthy Mediterranean diet and possibly other
  favorable lifestyle behaviors,4 study design and residual confounding might explain
  part of the differences observed.
- The biological mechanisms that could explain this relationship also remain unclear.
- However, olive oil's oleic acid may play a role in regulating cancer-related oncogenes,2,
  3 polyphenols such as hydroxytyrosol and oleuropein (abundant in extravirgin olive
  oil) may inhibit BC cell proliferation13 and squalene may protect against oxidative
  DNA damage in mammary cells.14 Nevertheless, these mechanisms might be related to
  specific types of olive oil, such as virgin or extravirgin oils, and a limitation
  of our study is precisely that information on olive oil type was not available for
  all women.
- To our knowledge, this is the first prospective study designed to assess the relationship
  between olive oil and BC.
- Our study strengths include the number of BC cases, information on hormone receptor
  subtypes and comprehensive adjustment for potentially confounding variables.
- In conclusion, our study shows that olive oil intake during adult life does not
  reduce the risk of overall BC; however, it suggests a potentially beneficial effect
  in hormone receptor-negative tumors.
- Further prospective studies need to confirm these findings and to further investigate
  the role of virgin and extravirgin olive oil in reducing BC risk, as well as possible
  differences related to hormone receptor status.
