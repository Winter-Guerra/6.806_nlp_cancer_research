- The present study aimed to investigate the dose response chemopreventive potential
  of allyl isothiocyanate (AITC) against 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) induced
  mammary carcinogenesis in female Sprague-Dawley rats.
- Mammary tumor was induced by a single dose of DMBA (25 mg/rat) injected subcutaneously
  near mammary gland.
- We observed reduced body weight and increased in total number of tumors, tumor incidence
  and tumor volume in DMBA-induced rats.
- We also observed decreased antioxidant status (SOD, CAT, GPX and GSH) and increased
  lipid peroxidation (TBARS and LOOH) in plasma and mammary tissues.
- Increased levels of CYP450, Cyt-b5 and decreased levels of phase II (GST and GR)
  biotransformation enzymes noticed in liver and mammary tissues of DMBA-induced rats.
- Further, increased levels of lipid profile (TC, TG, PL and FFA) and lipoprotein
  (LDL and VLDL) were noticed.
- Whereas, decreased level of HDL in plasma and decreased levels of PL and FFA in
  mammary tissue.
- Oral administration of AITC different doses (10, 20 and 40 mg/kg bw) inhibited the
  tumor incidence and restored levels of biochemical markers.
- Biochemical findings are supported by histopathological studies.
- These results suggested that AITC at a dose of 20 mg/kg bw significantly exert chemopreventive
  potential against DMBA-induced mammary carcinogenesis.
