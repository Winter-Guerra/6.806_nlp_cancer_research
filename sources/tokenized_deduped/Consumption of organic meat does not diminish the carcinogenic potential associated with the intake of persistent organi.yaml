- Numerous studies have shown an epidemiological link between meat consumption and
  the incidence of cancer, and it has been suggested that this relationship may be
  motivated by the presence of carcinogenic contaminants on it.
- Among the most frequently detected contaminants in meat are several types of persistent
  organic pollutants (POPs), and it is well known that many of them are carcinogenic.
- On the other hand, an increasing number of consumers choose to feed on what are
  perceived as healthier foods.
- Thus, the number of consumers of organic food is growing.
- However, environmental contamination by POPs is ubiquitous, and it is therefore
  unlikely that the practices of organic food production are able to prevent this
  contamination.
- To test this hypothesis, we acquired 76 samples of meat (beef, chicken, and lamb)
  of two modes of production (organic and conventional) and quantified their levels
  of 33 carcinogenic POPs.
- On this basis, we determined the human meat-related daily dietary exposure to these
  carcinogens using as a model a population with a high consumption of meat, such
  as the Spanish population.
- The maximum allowable meat consumption for this population and the carcinogenic
  risk quotients associated with the current pattern of consumption were calculated.
- As expected, no sample was completely free of carcinogenic contaminants, and the
  differences between organically and conventionally produced meats were minimal.
- According to these results, the current pattern of meat consumption exceeded the
  maximum limits, which are set according to the levels of contaminations, and this
  is associated with a relevant carcinogenic risk.
- Strikingly, the consumption of organically produced meat does not diminish this
  carcinogenic risk, but on the contrary, it seems to be even higher, especially that
  associated with lamb consumption.

  It is well known that the food is the primary route of exposure to pollutants from
  numerous chemical classes (Vogt et al.'
- 2012).
- Among the multitude of different chemical compounds that food may contain, persistent
  organic pollutants (POPs) are especially worrisome, and during the last decades,
  many POPs have been highlighted as a cause of concern and have been the subject
  of extensive study and international regulation in part because of their carcinogenic
  potential (Boada et al.
- 2012; Casals-Casas and Desvergne 2011; Dickerson et al.
- 2011; Dorgan et al.
- 1999; Knerr and Schrenk 2006; Ribas-Fito et al.
- 2001; Valeron et al.
- 2009).
- Since these compounds are highly resistant to degradation and are highly distributed
  in the environment, their presence in food is very difficult to avoid (Li et al.
- 2006; Rychen et al.
- 2014).
- Thus, it has been established that the ingestion of food contributes more than 90
  % to the total current exposure to these compounds, especially those food from animal
  origin such as fish, dairy products, or meat (Li et al.
- 2006).
- According to the literature, the content of POPs in meat is particularly relevant,
  and several studies have reported high levels of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs)
  (Letta and Attah 2013; Pardio et al.
- 2012; Schecter et al.
- 2010; Wang et al.
- 2011), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) (Costabeber et al.
- 2006; Malisch and Kotz 2014; Schecter et al.
- 2010; Schwarz et al.
- 2014), and especially polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which although they
  are not strictly considered as POPs, they are usually included in this group due
  to their high environmental prevalence and lipophilicity (Helmus et al.
- 2013; Lammel et al.
- 2013; Martorell et al.
- 2012; Veyrand et al.
- 2013).
- It is known that dietary practices may influence exposure to chemical contaminants
  such as POPs, through the food consumption pattern, the forms of cooking or processing
  the food, the production modes, packaging types, etc.
- (Luzardo et al.
- 2013a; Oates and Cohen 2011; Vogt et al.
- 2012).
- For example, a growing number of people choose organic food as a healthier choice,
  although the study of the profile of these consumers has indicated that they are
  also motivated by concern for environmental health, the animal welfare, or by the
  perception that organic food has a higher nutritional value than conventional products
  (Oates et al.
- 2012; Smith-Spangler et al.
- 2012; Vogt et al.
- 2012).
- In fact, in the USA, organic food production increased by 50 % during the last decade,
  and in Europe, this increase has been even higher (in some countries like Spain,
  the land surface devoted to organic production has tripled during this period) (FIBL-IFOAM
  2012).
- Numerous studies have compared organic and conventional food production, both in
  relation to their nutritional value and in relation to its content of chemical residues
  (Smith-Spangler et al.
- 2012).
- With respect to nutrient content, most studies indicate that organic food production
  does not have a higher nutritional value than conventional production (Smith-Spangler
  et al.
- 2012).
- However, studies have shown that organically produced foods have much less risk
  of being contaminated by residues of pesticides or other chemical pollutants than
  conventional foods (Smith-Spangler et al.
- 2012).
- Organic livestock are fed with organically produced feed that is free of pesticides
  and animal by-products (Beane 2013), and therefore it is supposed that there should
  be lower accumulation of chemical residues.
- However, practically, there are no studies on the chemical residues’ content in
  organic meat, although some authors have studied the presence of residues of veterinary
  drugs, heavy metals, microorganisms, and antibiotic resistance in organically and
  conventionally produced pigs (Hoogenboom et al.
- 2008).
- Therefore, the comparison with conventional production meat has also been scarcely
  studied.
- The study of chemical contamination of meat is relevant because the consumption
  of meat has been associated with the increased incidence of different types of cancer
  (Abid et al.
- 2014), and different studies have linked this increased risk of cancer with the
  presence of carcinogenic chemical substances in meat (Trafialek and Kolanowski 2014).
- Meat consumption in Europe is high (51.2 kg/year/person) (Chamorro et al.
- 2012), and according to the Integrated Risk Information System, a variety of the
  most common pollutants in meat, such as PCBs, hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH), dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane
  (DDT) and its metabolites, and some congeners of PAHs, have been classified in group
  B of carcinogenicity (probable human carcinogens) (WHO 2014).
- Although cancer slope factors (CSFs) have been calculated for all these probable
  carcinogens (EPA 2014) and this would allow an estimate of the risk of cancer associated
  with continuous exposure to them through foodstuff, very few studies have attempted
  to estimate the carcinogenic risks that are associated with the current pattern
  of consumption of meat and meat products (Trafialek and Kolanowski 2014).
- To our knowledge no study to date has considered studying whether organic meat production
  could be an option to reduce the carcinogenic potential of meat consumption in relation
  to their content of chemical carcinogens, especially POPs.
- This study was designed to test this hypothesis, where the concentrations of 7 PAHs,
  18 PCBs, and 8 OCPs for which the CSFs have been calculated were determined in samples
  of meats (chicken, beef, and lamb) from organic and conventional production.
- The samples were acquired in large suppliers who serve the entire European territory.
- 'The main objective of this study was to use these data to estimate the carcinogenic
  risk associated with the current level of meat consumption by the European population
  considering two possible scenarios: consumers that choose organic meats and consumers
  that choose conventional meats.'
- The methodology that has been recently used to estimate the carcinogenic risk in
  other food groups, such as fish (Yu et al.
- 2014), was applied, using the data of food consumption of the Spanish population.
- Two purchases of meat samples of the two modes of production (organic and conventional)
  were made in the last quarter of 2013 and the first of 2014.
- These purchases were made in supermarkets belonging to large European retail chains
  located in the Canary Islands (Spain), which have common suppliers, and can therefore
  be considered representative of the products available to consumers throughout the
  continent.
- 'A total of 76 samples of meat were acquired, which were distributed as follows:
  16 samples of lamb (8 from conventional production and 8 from organic production),
  32 samples of chicken (20 conventional and 12 organic), and 28 samples of beef (16
  conventional and 12 organic).'
- The samples were processed immediately after arrival at the laboratory.
- Each meat sample was finely chopped with a knife and milled using a stainless steel
  food processor.
- Then, all the samples were frozen at −18 °C until analysis.
- Dichloromethane, hexane, ethyl acetate, and cyclohexane (purity &gt;99.9 %) were
  purchased from Fisher Scientific (Leicestershire, UK).
- Ultrapure water was produced using a Milli-Q Gradient A10 (Millipore, Molsheim,
  France).
- Diatomaceous earth was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, USA).
- Bio-Beads SX-3 were purchased from BioRad Laboratories (Hercules, USA).
- Standards of OCPs, PCB congeners, and the internal standards (ISs, PCB 202, p,p′-DDE-d8,
  phenanthene-d10, tetrachloro-m-xylene, and heptachloro epoxide cis) were purchased
  from DrEhrenstorfer, Reference Materials (Augsburg, Germany).
- Standards of PAHs were purchased from Absolute Standards, Inc. (CT, USA).
- Stock solutions of each compound at 1 mg/mL were prepared in cyclohexane and stored
  at −20 °C.
- Solutions diluted from 0.05 to 100 ng/mL were used for calibration curves.
- 'The analytes selected for this study were 8 OCPs (p,p′-DDT, p,p′-DDE, p,p′-DDD,
  hexachlorobencene, and the four isomers of hexachlorocyclohexane (α-, β-, γ-, δ-HCH));
  18 PCB congeners, including marker-PCBs (M-PCBs) and dioxin-like PCBs (DL-PCBs)
  (IUPAC numbers # 28, 52, 77, 81, 101, 105, 114, 118, 123, 126, 138, 153, 156, 157,
  167, 169, 180, and 189); and 7 PAHs listed as carcinogens in the Toxics Release
  Inventory Program of the USA and the EPA’s Priority Chemical list (EPA 2001) (benzo(a)anthracene,
  benzo(a)phenanthrene (chrysene), benzo(a)pyrene, benzo(b)fluoranthene, benzo(k)fluoranthene,
  dibenzo(a,h)anthracene, and indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene).'
- All the contaminants included in this study are completely lipid-soluble and therefore
  are found in the lipid fraction of tissues.
- For this reason, the fat from the meat was firstly extracted.
- Thus, the samples (5 g) were homogenized in 5 mL of ultrapure water with a disperser
  (Ultra-turrax, IKA, China).
- This homogenate was spiked with the ISs mix in acetone (10 μg/mL) to yield a final
  concentration of 100 ng/mL and was mixed with 30 g of diatomaceous earth to absorb
  any moisture.
- The extraction and cleanup method followed the procedures recommended by the European
  Standard for the determination of pesticides and PCBs in fatty foods (EN 1996a,
  b), which had been previously validated in our laboratory for different fatty samples
  of animal origin (Almeida-Gonzalez et al.
- 2012; Garcia-Alvarez et al.
- 2014; Luzardo et al.
- 2014).
- This method achieves acceptable recoveries that ranged between 71.5 and 103.2 %.
- Briefly, the fat was extracted using a Soxtec™ 2055 Auto Fat Extraction (Foss® Analytical,
  Hilleroed, Denmark) apparatus, which consisted of an extraction unit, a control
  unit, and a drive unit.
- The samples were placed into the extraction unit, and 20 mL of dichloromethane was
  added to each of the extraction cups in a closed system, and the cups were heated
  using an electric heating plate.
- The three-step extraction consisted of boiling, rinsing, and solvent recovery.
- The solvent was evaporated in a rotary evaporator (Hei-VAP Advantage™, Heidolph
  Instruments®, Schwabach, Germany) at 40 °C to prevent analyte losses.
- Using a precision balance, the fat obtained was carefully weighted into a zeroed
  glass tube to determine the fat content of each meat sample (percentage).
- The weighted fat was dissolved in 2 mL of cyclohexane/ethyl acetate (1:1) and subjected
  to purification by gel permeation chromatography (BioBeads SX-3) using cyclohexane/ethyl
  acetate (1:1) at a constant flow of 2 mL/min as the eluent.
- The first 25-min elution volume, which contained the great majority of lipids (&gt;98
  %), was discarded.
- The 25–85-min elution volume (120 mL), which contained all the analytes that were
  co-extracted with the fat, was collected.
- The sample was concentrated using a rotary evaporator, and finally, the solvent
  was evaporated to dryness under a gentle nitrogen stream.
- The residue was then reconstituted in 1 mL of cyclohexane, and the sample was transferred
  to a GC vial that was used for the chromatographic analysis.
- The amount of pollutants per gram of fat was obtained by multiplying by the corresponding
  correction factor.
- The amount of contaminants in fresh meat was obtained by correcting for the fat
  percentage of each sample.
- All the compounds, plus ISs, were analyzed by gas chromatography-triple quadrupole
  mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) (Quantum XL, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham,
  MA, USA) as previously described (Camacho et al.
- 2013, 2014; Luzardo et al.
- 2013b).
- Briefly, a 30 m × 0.25 mm i.d., 0.25-μm film thickness column (BPX5, SGE Inc., Austin,
  TX, USA) was used as the stationary phase.
- Helium (99.999 %) was used as the carrier gas at a constant flow of 1 mL/min.
- 'The 61-min oven temperature program was as follows: 60 °C held for 1 min, ramped
  to 210 °C at 12 °C/min and then to 320 °C at 8 °C/min and held for 6 min.'
- The injector temperature was set at 270 °C, and the transfer line was heated to
  310 °C.
- The injection volume was 1 μl in the splitless mode.
- A timed selected reaction monitoring (SRM) method for the simultaneous analysis
  of all the compounds in a single run was constructed.
- 'The operation conditions of the mass spectrometer were as follows: electron impact
  ionization (70 eV) in SRM; emission current, 50 μA; ionization source temperature,
  220 °C; electron multiplier voltage, 1500 V; scan width, 0.15; scan time, 0.05 s;
  and peak width, _m_/_z_ 0.7, and Da.'
- 'Argon (99.99 %) was used as the collision gas at 0.2 Pa.




  All the recoveries were above 71 %, and it was thus considered acceptable to use
  this method for all the pollutants.'
- All the individual measurements were corrected by the recovery efficiency for each
  analyte.
- All the samples were injected three times, and the values used for the calculations
  were the mean of the three values.
- 'In each batch of samples, three controls were included for every nine vials (three
  samples): a reagent blank consisting of a vial containing only cyclohexane, a vial
  containing 2 ng/mL of each of the pollutants in cyclohexane, and an internal laboratory
  quality control (QC) consisting of melted meat fat spiked with a mixture of all
  the pesticides (20 μg/kg), and processed using the same method that was used for
  the samples.'
- The results were considered to be acceptable when the quantification of the analytes
  in the QC was within 15 % of the deviation of the theoretical value, which occurred
  in all the injections.
- The limit of quantification (LOQ) was set to 0.1 ng/g for all the analytes.
- A zero value was assigned to all the compounds below the limit of detection (LOD),
  and those compounds below the LOQ were assigned half of the LOQ.
- To estimate the daily intake of pollutants through the consumption of a certain
  type of meat, it is necessary to know the concentration of pollutants in that meat
  (median and mean values expressed in ng/g fresh product) and multiply that value
  by the daily average consumption of that meat in a given population.
- Data on food consumption in Europe are published by the European Food Safety Authority
  (EFSA) from data provided by the Member States of the EU (EFSA 2011).
- However, the data for the whole EU are available by food groups (meat) rather than
  for individual foods (pork, beef, and chicken).
- Given that Spain is one of the EU countries with the highest meat consumption per
  capita (the third after the Czech Republic and Hungary in the adult population,
  and the first in child and adolescent population), the values of consumption of
  individual foods by the Spanish population were used in this study, which have been
  published by the Spanish Agency for Consumer Food Safety and Nutrition (AECOSAN
  2006, 2011).
- While it has been established that regular organic food consumers tend to consume
  less amount of meat (up to 33 %) than non-consumers (Kesse-Guyot et al.
- 2013), in this paper, we have assumed that consumption is identical, for comparison
  purposes.
- 'For the risk assessment, two groups were considered: adults (18 years old and above,
  average weight 70.1 kg) and children (6 to 10 years old, average weight 30.4 kg).'
- 'For calculations of this paper, analytical values have been considered separately
  and grouped as follows: the total value of OCP residues (∑OCPs) as the sum of the
  8 OCPs and metabolites measured; the total value of DDTs (∑DDT) as the sum of the
  measured values of p,p′-DDT, p,p′-DDE, and p,p′-DDD; and the total value of HCH
  residues (∑HCH) as the sum of the 4 HCH isomers measured (α-, β-, δ-, and γ-HCH);
  the total value of PCB residues (∑PCBs) as the sum of the 18 PCB congeners measured;
  the total value of the marker PCB residues (∑M-PCBs) as the sum of the 7 congeners
  considered as markers of environmental contamination by PCBs (#28, 52, 101, 118,
  138, 153, and 180); the total value of dioxin-like PCBs (∑DL-PCBs) considered as
  the sum of the measurements of the 12 individual congeners (#77, 81, 105, 114, 118,
  123, 126, 156, 157, 167, 169, and 189); and the total content of carcinogenic PAHs
  (∑c-PAHs) as the sum of the values of the 7 US-EPA compounds following the EFSA
  recommendations (EFSA 2008).'
- Additionally, for the risk estimation, we calculated the potential toxicity (in
  terms of toxic equivalence to dioxins, TEQs) for the DL-PCBs using the toxic equivalency
  factors (TEFs) as revised by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2005 (Van den
  Berg et al.
- 2006), and the potential toxicity in terms of benzo[a]pyrene toxic equivalents (B[a]Peq)
  using the TEFs, which are established for the carcinogenic PAHs (Nisbet and LaGoy
  1992).
- 'The CFSs of the carcinogens included in this study were taken from the EPA’s IRIS
  (EPA 2014) and were as follows: 1 per mg of substance/kg body weight-day (mg/kg-day)
  for marker PCBs (based on Aroclors 1260, 1254, 1242, and 1061), 1.1 × 105 per mg/kg-day
  for dioxin-like PCBs (based on 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (2,3,7,8,-TCDD)),
  0.34 per mg/kg-day for DDTs, 1.8 per mg/kg-day for HCHs (as there are not CFS values
  listed for total HCHs, the values listed for β- and γ-HCH were used), 1.6 per mg/kg-day
  for hexachlorobencene, and 7.3 per mg/kg-day for PAHs (based on benzo[a]pyrene).'
- To estimate whether chemical contamination by carcinogens of meat endangers the
  consumers, we applied the risk assessment index, known as the risk quotient (RQ),
  using the methodology that has been used for other food groups, such as fish (Yu
  et al.
- 2014).
- 'RQ is defined as the ratio between the current consumption of meat (_R_ meat) and
  the maximum tolerable consumption of these products, which is calculated taking
  into account the concentrations of carcinogens in these foods (_CR_ lim) as follows:


  $$ C{R}_{\lim } = \frac{ARL\cdotp BW}{{\displaystyle {\sum}_{m=1}^X}{C}_{\mathrm{m}}\cdotp
  CS{F}_{\mathrm{m}}} $$


  where _CR_ lim is the maximum allowable consumption rate (kg/day) for a particular
  meat; _ARL_ is the maximum acceptable individual lifetime risk level (dimensionless),
  and a value of 10−5 was used in this study (Yu et al.'
- 2014); _BW_ is the body weight (kg); _C_ m is the median concentration of contaminant
  _m_ in a particular meat (mg/kg) as determined in this study; and _CSF_ m is the
  cancer slope factor of a contaminant _m_ (mg/kg/day) with carcinogenic potential.
- In the case of multiple contaminants with the same CSF, their concentrations in
  a particular type of meat were summed (from _m_ = 1 to _m_ = _x_).
- '$$ \begin{array}{c}\hfill RQ = \frac{R_{\mathrm{meat}}}{C{R}_{\lim }}\ \left(\mathrm{f}\mathrm{o}\mathrm{r}\
  \mathrm{a}\ \mathrm{s}\mathrm{ingle}\ \mathrm{contaminant}\right)\hfill \\\ {}\hfill
  RQ = {R}_{\mathrm{meat}}\cdotp\ {\displaystyle \sum_{m=1}^x}\frac{1}{C{R}_{\lim
  }}\left(\mathrm{f}\mathrm{o}\mathrm{r}\ \mathrm{multiple}\ \mathrm{contaminant}\mathrm{s}\right)\hfill
  \end{array} $$


  Thus, if the value of _RQ_ is equal to or less than 1, there is no carcinogenic
  risk associated with the ingestion of contaminants through the consumption of a
  particular type of meat.'
- Otherwise, the population is considered to be at carcinogenic risk when _RQ_ is
  greater than 1, indicating that the current consumption of that foodstuff is greater
  than its _CR_ lim value.
- The PASW Statistics v 19.0 software package (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used
  to manage the database of the study and to perform the statistical analyses.
- Normality was examined using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.
- The POP distributions in the meat samples lacked normality and homoscedasticity;
  therefore, we used non-parametric tests (the Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests).
- The results are reported as the medians and percentiles 25th–75th ranges.
- Probability levels of less than 0.05 (two-tailed) were considered statistically
  significant.
- The main objective of this paper is to provide an estimate of the level of exposure
  to carcinogenic POPs through consumption of beef, chicken, or lamb, depending on
  their mode of production (conventional production or organic production).
- While the levels of many of these substances have been identified in previous studies
  carried out in different parts of the world, all these works have been performed
  in conventionally produced meat.
- As far as we know, no work has been done specifically on organic meats.
- Also, as one might expect, the levels of carcinogenic POPs in meats published to
  date are highly variable (sometimes very significantly) (Costabeber et al.
- 2006; Letta and Attah 2013; Malisch and Kotz 2014; Pardio et al.
- 2012; Polder et al.
- 2010; Schecter et al.
- 2010; Tornkvist et al.
- 2011; Wang et al.
- 2011), which is logical because it is very common to find regional variations in
  contaminant levels.
- Since the objective of this paper is not to compare our results with previous works
  but to make a comparison of exposure depending on the product chosen by consumers,
  to make a realistic estimate, we preferred to directly quantify the contaminants
  in a representative sample of the main types of meat that any European consumer
  can find in supermarkets of the continent, and directly determine over them carcinogenic
  contaminant levels.
- Table 1 presents a summary of the data obtained directly from these samples, expressed
  as median and percentiles 25th and 75th.
- "Concentrations of contaminants with carcinogenic potential (ng g−1 w.w.) in samples
  of organic and conventional meat available in the European market  \n\n\n\n\nc _P_
  value results from the comparison between the medians (Mann-Whitney test), where:\n\n\n\nAs
  it would be expected in foods of animal origin, none of the samples was free of
  all the contaminants investigated."
- Both, meat samples from organic production and from conventional production, presented
  an average of 19 residues (ranging from 11 to 24 residues out of 33).
- In any case, the levels found in all samples were below the levels legally established
  in Europe (maximum residue levels, MRLs) (EC 2006a, b).
- The highest levels of contaminants found in this study were those of the M-PCBs
  in lamb, both organically and conventionally produced, and those of DDTs, also in
  organic and conventional lamb.
- In fact, these two sets of pollutants, the M-PCBs and DDTs, were the most abundant
  in all types of meat, as shown in Table 1.
- With regard to the PCB content of meats, it is remarkable that these were completely
  dominated by congeners 118, 138, 153, and 180 in all the cases, and thus, the ∑M-PCBs
  contributed with 94.3–99.8 % to the ∑PCBs.
- In fact, DL-PCBs were the contaminants that reached the lowest levels in all meat
  types, and therefore the toxic equivalent quantity (TEQ) levels for dioxin-like
  PCBs in the meat samples analyzed had low median values (range from 0.01 to 0.41
  pg/g w.w.) (Table 1).
- Two facts attracted attention of our results.
- First, the fact that pollution levels are quite different between distinct types
  of meats.
- Thus, lamb is by far the one with the highest levels of all pollutants studied.
- At the other extreme, we find the chicken (skinless) having the lowest levels in
  all cases.
- The beef meat shows intermediate values (Table 1).
- These differences are probably attributable to the very different percentages of
  fat of each type of meat, because when we compare the data expressed as nanograms
  of carcinogen per gram of fat rather than per gram of fresh product, the differences
  are much smaller (data not shown).Second, it is interesting to note that the differences
  between the two modes of production, organic and conventional, can be considered
  minimal, generally speaking.
- Table 1 shows the values of statistical significance found for each of the pollutants
  and meats.
- As seen above, the highest differences were found between organic and conventional
  beef.
- However, contrary to what one might think, not in all cases the values were lower
  in meat from organic production.
- Thus, as it can be observed in Table 1, in the case of hexachlorobenzene (HCB),
  levels found in samples of organic beef and organic chicken were significantly higher
  than those found in the same meats from conventional production.
- Also noteworthy is the case of HCH isomers (∑HCH) since, although not statistically
  significant, a trend is observed that the levels are higher in lamb and beef from
  organic production.
- However, in relation to these contaminants, the trend was reversed in chicken meat
  (in this case with statistical significance, _p_ &gt; 0.05, Table 1).
- 'As the differences were not very relevant when analyzed by pollutants, we also
  performed the comparison by grouping them by chemical classes: OCPs, PCBs, and PAHs.'
- The results are shown in Fig.
- 1
- The only significant differences in the level of pollutants according to the mode
  of production were found for OCPs (in the three types of meat) and PAHs (in beef).
- The most striking results were that organic lamb meat contained much higher levels
  of OCPs than conventionally produced lamb (_p_ &lt; 0.001, Fig.
- 1).
- These higher levels were also found in chicken meat, but the differences were much
  smaller (_p_ &lt; 0.05).
- 'However, for beef meat, the situation was reverse: conventional production beef
  showed higher levels of OCPs than beef from organic production, and the same was
  obtained for the levels of PAHs (_p_ &lt; 0.05 in both cases).'
- Box plots of the levels of ∑OCPs (a), ∑PCBs (b), and ∑c-PAHs (c) in the three types
  of meat studied, and comparison between the two modes of production of these meats
  (conventional vs. organic).
- 'The _line_ inside the _boxes_ represents the median, the _bottom_ and _top_ of
  the _boxes_ are the first and third quartiles of the distribution, and the _lines_
  extending vertically from the _boxes_ indicate the variability outside the upper
  and lower quartiles




  Dietary exposure calculations are performed by combining data on consumption habits
  with the concentrations of contaminants found in food samples.'
- The estimation of food consumption, nutrient intake, and contaminant exposure is
  a topic of growing interest in the field of public health as a means to inform and
  guide the actions on food security and nutrition, and as a predictive method for
  determining the state of health of populations.
- For this reason, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) performs a collection
  of food consumption data from the different Member States (MS), which must develop
  nutritional surveys in their territories.
- On this basis, the Authority prepares an European database of Food Consumption (http://​www.​efsa.​europa.​eu/​en/​datexfoodcdb/​datexfooddb.​htm).
- For the estimates in this paper, the data provided by the authorities on food security
  of our country, Spain (AECOSAN 2006, 2011), were used.
- The reason for this is that Spain overall meat consumption has steadily increased
  over the last few decades (Kanerva 2013; Leon-Munoz et al.
- 2012), and currently, the meat industry is ranked in fifth position in the industrial
  sector of the Spanish economy and is ranked first among the agro-food industries
  (Chamorro et al.
- 2012).
- Thus, meat consumption in Spain increased from one of the lowest ones in the EU
  reaching an average per capita consumption of 52.7 kg/year/person, which is even
  higher than the European average (51.2 kg/year/person) (Chamorro et al.
- 2012).
- In any case, using food consumption data from any EU country, and the concentrations
  of pollutants reported in this paper, daily intake levels of these pollutants for
  the different European populations can be easily obtained.
- It should be noted that in our estimates, we have assumed that all consumers (strict
  consumers of organic products, occasional consumers of organic products, and non-consumers
  of organic products) equally fit the pattern of consumption defined in nutrition
  surveys.
- This assumption has been made for comparison purposes, although it has been recently
  described that those strict consumers of organic products tend to consume up to
  30 % less meat than consumers of conventional products (Kesse-Guyot et al.
- 2013), and therefore their actual exposure would be lower than the estimates presented
  here.
- Table 2 summarizes the dietary intake of all the contaminants included in this study
  arranged by groups (on the basis of their similar carcinogenic potential), for children
  (6–10 years) and adults (&gt;18 years).
- "Median values of dietary intakes of carcinogenic POPs (ng/kg b.w./day) by means
  of the consumption of organic and conventional meats for Spanish adults and children
  \ \n\n\n\nFirst, with regards to the OCPs, our results show that the estimated daily
  intake (EDI) of ∑DDTs through the consumption of these three types of meat for adults
  living in Spain is 55.71 ng/kg body weight (b.w."
- )/day if they choose to consume conventional products, and 86.75 ng/kg b.w./day
  if they choose to consume organic meats, mainly due to the contribution of lamb
  meat in both cases.
- In children, the exposure to ∑DDTs through meat consumption is even higher, being
  91.02 ng/kg b.w./day for consumers of conventionally produced meat, and up to 119.86
  ng/kg b.w./day for consumers of organic meats.
- In any case, it should be noted that these consumptions represent only between 0.5
  and 1.2 % (depending on the consumer and their choice) of the provisional tolerable
  daily intake (TDI) for humans established by the World Health Organization for these
  contaminants (0.01 mg/kg b.w./day)(JECFA 2000).
- With regard to the exposure to ∑HCHs through meat consumption, the EDIs were much
  higher in adults and children consuming organic products (36.8 and 51.59 ng/kg b.w./day,
  respectively) than in consumers of conventionally produced meats (4.08 and 7.67
  ng/kg b.w./day, respectively) (_p_ &lt; 0.005).
- However, it is remarkable that, again, in this case, the exposure to ∑HCHs is also
  far from the established TDIs (5000 ng/kg b.w./day) (JECFA 2000), representing less
  than 1 % of this value even in the worst scenario.
- The main contributors of this exposure to ∑HCHs were organic lamb and organic beef.
- Finally, within the group of OCPs, with regard to the intake of HCB, we found that
  once again the major contributor was by far lamb meat.
- However, in this case, organically and conventionally produced lamb contributed
  almost equally to the exposure to this contaminant.
- Thus, the HCB EDIs for adults and children who consume organic meat were 56.49 and
  76.57 ng/kg b.w./day, respectively, and were 54.49 and 68.62 ng/kg b.w./day for
  those adults and children consuming conventionally produced meats.
- In the case of this contaminant, these EDIs represent between 6.8 and 9.57 % of
  the TDI set by WHO for HCB (JECFA 2000).
- With regard to the group of M-PCBs, the exposure through meat consumption was very
  similar between consumers of organic and conventional meats, as seen in Table 2.
- The main dietary intake of these contaminants is from beef.
- Thus, adult population would be exposed to 37.19 ng/kg b.w./day if they consume
  conventionally produced meat, and to 35.71 ng/kg b.w./day if they consume organic
  meats.
- In children, the PCB EDIs are almost double than in adults (74.27 and 69.49 ng/kg
  b.w./day for conventional and organic meat consumers, respectively).
- As, for the total PCBs, a TDI value has not been established, it is necessary to
  consider the intake of the most toxic compounds, the DL-PCBs, expressed in terms
  of the equivalency to dioxin toxicity, to assess the level and exposure.
- Using this approach, our estimates of ∑TEQDL-PCBs would represent 3.5 to 16 % of
  the TDI of 2 pg/kg b.w./day (SCF 2000).
- In this case, the highest levels of exposure were found for children who consume
  conventionally produced meats.
- Our results are in accordance to other studies where authors have estimated that
  meat is an important source of dioxins and dioxin-like compounds in a high percentage
  of the samples analyzed (Costabeber et al.
- 2006; Malisch and Kotz 2014; Schecter et al.
- 2010; Schwarz et al.
- 2014; Tornkvist et al.
- 2011).
- These results are worrisome because the possibility exists that certain consumers
  may be subject to high dietary exposures to dioxins, even though they choose to
  consume organic food.
- Finally, with regard to the last chemical group studied, the c-PAHs, we found that
  conventionally produced beef meat was the major contributor.
- As shown in Table 2, the EDIs (expressed as equivalents of B[a]P) for the adult
  population is 1.6 ng/kg b.w./day if they consume conventionally produced meat, and
  a little bit lower if they choose to consume organic meats (1.08 ng/kg b.w./day).
- In children, the EDIs are 3.03 and 1.85 ng/kg b.w./day for consumers of conventional
  and organic meats, respectively.
- To date, the WHO has not yet established TDI values for c-PAHs or benzo[a]pyrene
  (JECFA 2000).
- However, other references may be used.
- Thus, using the Contaminated Land Exposure Assessment (CLEA) model of the UK, which
  has established a TDI for B[a]Peq of 20 ng/kg b.w./day (CLEA-UK 2008), the current
  meat consumption in Spain would represent up to 15 % of these values (in children
  consuming conventionally produced meats).
- As shown in the previous section, in all cases, the intake of contaminants through
  the consumption of meat represents a relatively discrete percentage of the TDI established
  for each of them.
- However, the main objective of our research is focused on the study of the carcinogenic
  potential associated with the consumption of carcinogenic POPs with meat.
- It has been established that the RQ evaluation is a good method to estimate the
  risk of a population (in this case the carcinogenic risk), and to establish exposure
  limits to chemicals (USEPA 2000).
- However, the application of this method to multiple chemical contaminants present
  in food has some weaknesses because assumptions must be made.
- Thus, it is well known that chemicals in foods are usually present in mixtures of
  various compounds belonging to different chemical classes, and thus they may exert
  their adverse effects on consumers interacting with each other in synergistic, additive,
  or even in antagonistic manners.
- However, the calculation model of the RQ implies the assumption that all pollutants
  cause similar toxicological effects and that the combined effect is the sum of the
  individual effects (USEPA 2000).
- Nevertheless, as recommended by the USEPA, we have considered that all carcinogens
  studied are similar and, therefore, we have used the additive model for calculating
  the RQs.
- To do this, the _CR_ lim values (which represent the maximum allowable consumption
  of each meat type on the basis of their load of pollutants) were used for both adults
  and children (Table 3).
- According to these results, the current pattern of consumption of meat in the Spanish
  population implies that some of these limits are exceeded.
- Thus, the _CR_ lim of ∑M-PCBs is exceeded by the consumption of all three types
  of meat, either organic or conventional, both in adults and especially in children.
- The _CR_ lim of HCB and ∑DDTs are also exceeded by lamb consumption in both age
  groups, regardless the type of meat production and consumers’ choice.
- Finally, current consumption of conventionally produced beef also implies that the
  _CR_ lim values of ∑DDTs and B[a]Peq are overpassed in children.
- "Values of maximum allowable consumption rate of conventional or organic meat (_CR_
  lim), expressed in g/day  \n\n\nThe current values of consumption of these products
  by the Spanish population (g/day) are included for reference\n\nAccording to the
  _CR_ lim, we calculated _RQs_ associated with the current consumption of each meat
  type for both adults and children (Fig."
- 2).
- From our results, two facts powerfully attract the attention.
- First, the current pattern of consumption of meat implies a carcinogenic risk (_RQ_
  &gt; 1) in all cases.
- The calculated carcinogenic risk ranges between 1.76 and 17.41 in adults, and between
  3.45 and 17.65 in children.
- On the other hand, it is striking that the POP-associated carcinogenic risk tends
  to be higher in organic meats that in those which are conventionally produced.
- This is especially relevant in lamb meat, where the consumption of organic product
  implies a carcinogenic risk up to 1.5 times higher than the consumption of the conventionally
  produced option, both in adults and children.
- Risk quotients of the contaminants for carcinogenic effects in adults (_upper panel_)
  and children (_lower panel_) via consumption of conventionally or organically produced
  meats.
- 'The _discontinuous horizontal line_ indicates the threshold for carcinogenic risk
  (_RQ_ = 1)




  In this research, the concentrations of 33 persistent organic pollutants with carcinogenic
  potential were determined in a large sample of meats available in the European supermarkets
  from two modes of production: conventional and organic.'
- A mean of 19 of these 33 contaminants in all the samples tested (11–24) were found,
  but in no case the established MRLs were exceeded.
- Some significant differences in the levels of pollutants between organically and
  conventionally produced meats were found, but these differences can be considered
  of minor entity.
- As it is well known that continued exposure to carcinogens is not without risk (even
  at very low doses), the daily intake of these contaminants from the meat were estimated,
  taking a high meat consumer population such as the Spanish population as a model
  (adults and children).
- According to these estimates, exposure is similar in children than in adults, and
  also very similar if these consumers choose conventional or organic meats, generally
  speaking.
- The approximation of the risk ratio was used to evaluate the carcinogenic risk of
  the current pattern of consumption of these meats in the studied population, and
  a relevant risk was found in all the cases.
- Surprisingly, the risk seems to be even higher if the consumer chooses to consume
  organic meats (especially lamb).
- This work demonstrates once again that environmental contamination by POPs is ubiquitous
  and human exposure is very difficult to avoid.
- Even those consumers who choose to consume organic food, which is theoretically
  healthier, have exposure rates to these legacy pollutants that can become even higher
  than those of consumers who eat conventional food.
- This shows that efforts to minimize the environmental presence of these toxic pollutants
  should be continued and even strengthened.
