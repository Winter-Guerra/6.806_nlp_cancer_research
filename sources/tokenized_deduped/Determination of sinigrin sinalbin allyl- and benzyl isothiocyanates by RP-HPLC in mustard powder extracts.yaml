- A reversed phase-high performance liquid chromatography method was developed to
  quantify sinigrin, sinalbin, allyl isothiocyanate and benzyl isothiocyanate present
  in aqueous and freeze-dried yellow and Oriental (brown) mustard extract samples
  using two pre-treatment methods (autoclaving, boiling) to prevent degradation by
  myrosinase.
- The lowest detection limits for sinigrin and sinalbin were 0.05 mg/L and for allyl-
  and benzyl isothiocyanate were 2 mg/L.
- The methods developed make it possible to quantify both the glucosinolates (sinigrin,
  and sinalbin) and their hydrolysis products (allyl- and benzyl isothiocyanate) with
  the same mobile phase, and only require adjustment of the wavelength and a change
  in the ratio of the high performance liquid chromatography mobile phase solvents
  (tetrabutylammonium hydrogen sulphate and acetonitrile).
- The use of a single method yielded accurate and rapid results for the four compounds
  (sinigrin, sinalbin, allyl- and benzyl isothiocyanate).
- Autoclaving of both yellow and brown mustard powder before glucosinolate extraction
  did not consistently improve the amount of sinalbin and sinigrin recovered over
  boiling treatments because the thermal stability of myrosinase proved problematic
  in glucosinolate recovery.
- Nonetheless, the highest extract yields found were 4.06 g/100 g for sinigrin and
  2.57 g/100 g for sinalbin, respectively, which represented over 94 g/100 g extract
  yield of sinigrin from the Oriental mustard powder.
