- Skin removal is a generally accepted method to reduce exposure to contaminants through
  fish consumption.
- However, inconsistent results from studies on the effectiveness of this method suggest
  influence of other factors such as characteristics of contaminants and fish species.
- This study investigated the effects of skin removal on the lipid contents and concentrations
  of total mercury, Î±-chlordane, hexachlorobenzene, mirex, octachlorosytrene, polychlorinated
  biphenyls (PCB), dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane
  (DDD), and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE).
- Four fish species namely brown trout (_Salmo trutta_), Chinook salmon (_Oncorhynchus
  tschawytscha_), coho salmon (_Oncorhynchus kisutch_) and rainbow trout (_Oncorhynchus
  mykiss_) sampled from the Credit River, Ontario, Canada were considered.
- Concentrations of all the lipophilic organic contaminants decreased significantly
  (median 17-37%) after removing skins from filets of brown trout, Chinook salmon
  and coho salmon, but not of rainbow trout.
- In contrast, the concentrations of mercury tended to be either similar or marginally
  higher after removing skins from filets of all four species; however, the amount
  of mercury would have likely declined or remained unchanged.
- Overall, removal of skin before consuming a fish filet is recommended to reduce
  exposure to contaminants widely found in Ontario fish.
