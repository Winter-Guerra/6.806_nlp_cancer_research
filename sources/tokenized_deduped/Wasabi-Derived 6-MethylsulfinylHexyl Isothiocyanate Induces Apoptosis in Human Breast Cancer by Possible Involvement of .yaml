- 6-(methylsulfinyl)hexyl isothiocyanate (6-MSITC) is a bioactive ingredient of wasabi
  (_Wasabia japonica_), which is a popular spice in Japan.
- 6-MSITC has been reported to inhibit the proliferation of breast cancer and melanoma
  cell lines.
- We inoculated 30 female Balb-nu/nu mice with MDA-MB-231 or -453 cells, and orally
  administered varying concentrations of 6-MSITC for 12 days following tumor growth.
- The tumor volumes and tumor weights from mice inoculated with MDA-MB-231 cells,
  and the tumor volumes of MDA-MB-453 cells were significantly inhibited by 6-MSITC
  on Days 9 and 11 after drug administration.
- DNA fragmentation, DNA ladder, and caspase 3/7 activity performed in vitro revealed
  that 6-MSITC induced apoptosis of MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-453, and MCF-7 cells.
- Furthermore, nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) expression in the nuclei and phosphorylation
  of inhibitor κBα (IκBα) was downregulated by 6-MSITC in a concentration-dependent
  manner; however, this activity was not observed in MCF-7 cells.
- Moreover, this downregulation of phosphorylated IκBα by 6-MSITC in MDA-MB-231 and
  -453 cells supports its inhibitory effects on NF-κB activity.
- The expression of phosphorylated AKT (pAKT) reduced by 6-MSITC was confirmed in
  MDA-MB-231 cells.
- Thus, we conclude that 6-MITC promotes apoptosis of breast cancer cells by inhibiting
  NF-kB and therefore releasing its control of the PI3K/AKT pathway.
