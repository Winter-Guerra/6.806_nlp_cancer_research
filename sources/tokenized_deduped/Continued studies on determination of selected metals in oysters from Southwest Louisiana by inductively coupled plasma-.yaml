- This work provides results of a continued study of selected metal concentrations
  from oysters from Southwest Louisiana.
- Results were compared to previous studies in 2007 and 2009 and found to be comparable
  for three metals (Cd, Cr, and Pb) lower for two metals (Cu and Zn) and slightly
  higher for one metal (Fe).
- Continued improvement (lower concentrations) was found in this study compared to
  2007 for Pd and Cd indicating that potential high concentrations from 2005 Hurricane
  Rita were significantly reduced.
