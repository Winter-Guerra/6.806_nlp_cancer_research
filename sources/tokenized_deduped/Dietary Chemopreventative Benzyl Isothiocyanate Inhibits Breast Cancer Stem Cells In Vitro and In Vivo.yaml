- A small subset of mammary tumor-initiating cells (also known as breast cancer stem
  cells; bCSC), characterized by expression of different markers [CD44high/CD24low/epithelial-specific
  antigen (ESA)+], aldehyde dehydrogenase-1 (ALDH1) activity, and ability to form
  mammospheres under ultra-low attachment culture conditions, are suspected to evade
  conventional therapies leading to disease recurrence.
- Elimination of both therapy-sensitive epithelial tumor cells and therapy-resistant
  bCSC is therefore necessary for prevention of breast cancer.
- We have shown previously that a nontoxic small-molecule constituent of edible cruciferous
  vegetables (benzyl isothiocyanate; BITC) inhibits mammary cancer development in
  mouse mammary tumor virus-_neu_ (MMTV-_neu_) transgenic mice by causing epithelial
  tumor cell apoptosis.
- The present study shows efficacy of BITC against bCSC _in vitro_ and _in vivo_.
- Mammosphere formation frequency and CD44high/CD24low/ESA+ and/or ALDH1+ populations
  in cultured MCF-7 (estrogen receptor–positive) and SUM159 (triple-negative) human
  breast cancer cells were decreased significantly in the presence of plasma achievable
  concentrations of BITC.
- BITC administration in the diet (3 μmol BITC/g diet for 29 weeks) resulted in a
  marked decrease in bCSCs in the MMTV-_neu_ mice tumors _in vivo_.
- Overexpression of full-length Ron as well as its truncated form (sfRon), but not
  urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor, conferred near complete protection
  against BITC-mediated inhibition of bCSCs in MCF-7 cells.
- The BITC treatment downregulated protein levels of Ron and sfRon in cultured breast
  cancer cells and in tumor xenografts.
- Ron overexpression resulted in upregulation of bCSC-associated genes _Oct-4_, _SOX-2_,
  and _Nanog_.
- In conclusion, the present study indicates that BITC treatment eliminates bCSCs
  _in vitro_ and _in vivo_.
