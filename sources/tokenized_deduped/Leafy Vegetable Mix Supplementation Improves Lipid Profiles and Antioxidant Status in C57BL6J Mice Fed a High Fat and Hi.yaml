- Daily consumption of an antioxidant-rich leafy vegetable mix (LVM) was assessed
  for beneficial effects on plasma lipid profiles, tissue lipid peroxidation, and
  oxidative DNA damage in C57BL/6J mice fed a high fat and high cholesterol diet (20%
  fat and 1% cholesterol, wt/wt) for 4 weeks.
- The LVM contained beet leaf, angelica, red leaf lettuce, dandelion, green cos lettuce,
  lollo rosso, romaine lettuce (12.5%, respectively), scotch kale, and red kale (6.25%,
  respectively).
- The mice (_n_ = 16) were randomly divided into either the control (high fat and
  cholesterol diet without LVM) or the LVM (high fat and cholesterol diet with 8%
  LVM supplement) groups after a 1-week acclimation.
- Lipid peroxidation as measured by thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances in the
  plasma, liver, heart, and kidney was significantly lower.
- Antioxidants (glutathione and _Î²_-carotene) and antioxidant enzyme activities (glutathione
  peroxidase, glutathione reductase, and superoxide dismutase) were improved in mice
  fed LVM diet.
- In the comet assay, tail extent moment, olive tail moment, and tail length were
  significantly less in the hepatocyte and lymphocyte DNA of the LVM group, indicating
  the beneficial effect of LVM on the resistance of hepatocytes and lymphocytes DNA
  to oxidative damage.
- Findings from the present study suggest that dietary supplementation with LVM may
  be useful for protecting cells from lipid peroxidation and oxidative DNA damage.
