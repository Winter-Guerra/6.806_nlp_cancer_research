- We prospectively evaluated fat intake as predictor of developing breast cancer (BC)
  subtypes defined by estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human
  epidermal growth factor 2 receptor (HER2), in a large (n = 337327) heterogeneous
  cohort of women, with 10062 BC case patients after 11.5 years, estimating BC hazard
  ratios (HRs) by Cox proportional hazard modeling.
- High total and saturated fat were associated with greater risk of ER+PR+ disease
  (HR = 1.20, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.00 to 1.45; HR = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.09
  to 1.52; highest vs lowest quintiles) but not ER−PR− disease.
- High saturated fat was statistically significantly associated with greater risk
  of HER2− disease.
- High saturated fat intake particularly increases risk of receptor-positive disease,
  suggesting saturated fat involvement in the etiology of this BC subtype.
