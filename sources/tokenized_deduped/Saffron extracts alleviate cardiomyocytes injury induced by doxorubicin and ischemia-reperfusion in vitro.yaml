- Doxorubicin (DOX), a highly active chemotherapeutic drug, faces limitations in clinical
  application due to severe cardiotoxic effects (mainly through increased oxidative
  stress).
- Therefore, its effect is exacerbated in subjects with ischemic heart disease.
- We have recently reported that saffron extract (SAF), a natural compound mainly
  consisting of safranal and corcins, exerts a protective effect against DOX oxidative
  cytotoxicity in isolated rabbit hearts.
- Here, we aimed to investigate whether SAF exerts cardioprotection against combined
  ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) and DOX toxicity in H9c2 cardiomyocytes.
- H9c2 were subjected to simulated I/R, with or without DOX treatment at reperfusion,
  in the presence or absence of SAF prior to ischemia or at reperfusion.
- We evaluated the effects of these treatments by MTT, LDH and western blot analysis.
- Apoptosis was assessed by Hoechst 33258 staining, tetramethyl rhodamine methyl ester
  fluorescence and caspase activity.
- The results showed that I/R and DOX significantly decreased cardiomyocytes viability,
  inhibited reperfusion injury salvage kinase cardioprotective pathway, reduced contractile
  proteins (α-Actinine, Troponine C and MLC), increased caspase-3 expression and induced
  loss of mitochondrial membrane potential.
- These effects were remarkably inhibited by treatment with SAF (10 μg/mL) at reperfusion.
- SAF activated AKT/P70S6K and ERK1/2, restored contractile proteins expression, inhibited
  mitochondrial permeability transition pore and decreased caspase-3 activity.
- In conclusion, our findings indicate that SAF treatment exerted cardioprotection
  against I/R and DOX toxicity by reducing oxidative stress (LDH assay).
- Thereby, SAF offers a potential novel antioxidant therapeutic strategy to counteract
  I/R and DOX cardiotoxicity, paving the way for future clinical trials.
