- This study investigates the carbohydrate-hydrolyzing inhibitory potential of blueberry
  extract on carbohydrate-hydrolyzing enzymes and evaluates if the inhibitory activity
  is proanthocyanidin (PAC) or lower molecular weight phenolic dependent.
- Freeze-dried blueberry powder was extracted using acetone and subjected to C18 extraction
  (BAE).
- Low-molecular weight phenolics (BAE-LMW) and PACs (BAE-PAC) were separated from
  BAE with gel filtration chromatography using LH-20 column.
- Total phenolic content, PAC content, and phenolic profiles using HPLC, as well as
  rat _α_-glucosidase, sucrase, and maltase inhibitory activities, were determined
  for all samples.
- The rat alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity of BAE (IC50 0.390 mg/mL TP basis)
  was enhanced in BAE-LMW (IC50 0.242 mg/mL TP basis) and reduced in BAE-PAC (IC50
  0.915 mg/mL TP basis).
- Similar trends were observed with maltase and sucrase inhibitory activities.
- Our findings suggest that blueberry acetone extract has inhibitory activity on carbohydrate-hydrolyzing
  enzymes and this effect is dependent on LMWs rather than PAC.

  Type 2 diabetes, once called non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDIM), is
  a metabolic disorder that is characterized by high level of glucose in the blood.'
- The disease is associated with high calorie diets as well as the consumption of
  high calorie sweetened foods.
- Worldwide, 347 million people have diabetes (WHO 2013) resulting in immense health
  care costs (ADA 2013a).
- Type 2 diabetes accounts for 90 % of diabetes cases (WHO 2013).
- In 2011, 79 million people in U.S.A. aged 20 years or older were classified as prediabetic
  (CDC 2013).
- The American Diabetes Association defines prediabetic individual as an individual
  with blood glucose levels higher than normal (impaired fasting glucose between 100
  and 125 mg/dL, impaired glucose tolerance between 140 and 199 mg/dL, and HbA1c between
  5.7 and 6.4 %) but not high enough to be considered diabetic (impaired fasting glucose
  between &gt;126 mg/dL, impaired glucose tolerance between &gt;200 mg/dL, and HbA1c
  between &gt;6.5 %) (ADA 2013b).
- _α_-Glucosidase inhibitors, such as acarbose, are the only oral anti-diabetes agent
  approved for the treatment of pre-diabetes (Hanefeld 2007).
- Briefly, lower doses of acarbose have shown to have beneficial effect toward pre-diabetes
  management by delaying the absorption of carbohydrates from the gut (Hanefeld 2007).
- Taking into consideration that pre-diabetes is not a disease would be more desirable
  to find natural components capable of reducing glucose absorption in the small intestinal
  environment, via inhibition of carbohydrate-hydrolyzing enzymes.
- Dietary carbohydrates are digested by carbohydrate-hydrolyzing enzymes, resulting
  in monosaccharides, which are then absorbed through the small intestine.
- The carbohydrate-hydrolyzing enzymes break down polysaccharides, oligosaccharides,
  and disaccharides to monosaccharides.
- Alpha-glucosidases are expressed in small intestine and are a group of enzymes that
  hydrolyzes disaccharides such as sucrose, maltose, and lactose to monosaccharides.
- Therefore, inhibition of alpha-glucosidases (sucrase and maltase) can be an effective
  strategy to reduce the glucose absorption in the digestive tract (Krentz and Bailey
  2005).
- It has been reported that certain natural products are potentially good inhibitors
  of carbohydrate-hydrolyzing enzymes with their effect being attributed to the unique
  phenolic phytochemicals (Kwon et al.
- 2006, 2007; Apostolidis et al.
- 2012).
- Blueberries are great sources of various phenolic phytochemicals (Castrejón et al.
- 2008).
- Major cities of high-bush blueberry production in USA include California, Mississippi,
  North Carolina, Oregon, and Washington (Strik and Yarborough 2005).
- More than half of all high-bush blueberries are shipped to the fresh market, to
  keep pace with the ever-increasing demand.
- The rest are frozen, pureed, concentrated, canned, or dried to be used in a wide
  range of food products including yogurt, pastries, muffins, cereals, and health
  bars (U.S High Blueberry Council 2012).
- Previous reports evaluated a wide variety of different phenolic-derived blueberry
  health benefits.
- Some of the phenolic-derived health benefits of blueberries include anti-cancer
  activity(Adams et al.
- 2010), heart disease prevention (Basu et al.
- 2010), antioxidant activity (Wang et al.
- 2008), and anti-inflammatory effect (Paul et al.
- 2009).
- In addition, an animal trial using low-bush blueberries demonstrated that the phenolic-enriched
  fraction can enhance insulin sensitivity (Grace et al.
- 2009), which in turn can help manage Type 2 diabetes.
- A recent animal trial using obese and hyperglycemic C57BL/6 mice showed that administration
  of defatted soybean flour fortified with blueberry phenolics for 13 weeks reduces
  weight gain, improves glucose tolerance, and lowers fasting blood glucose levels
  (Roopchard et al.
- 2012).
- Another preliminary study showed that both high-bush and low-bush blueberries have
  a phenolic-dependent alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity (Wang et al.
- 2012).
- Phenolic phytochemicals, secondary metabolites of plant origin, are important components
  of human diet.
- Major phenolic compounds present in blueberries include phenolic acids (such as
  chlorogenic acid) (Gavrilova et al.
- 2011), anthocyanins (Hellstrom et al.
- 2007), and proanthocyanidins (Hellstrom et al.
- 2007).
- Proanthocyanidins (PACs) are condensed tannins which consist of oligomeric and/or
  polymeric flavans and flavan-3-ols.
- PACs can be classified as A-type or B-type depending on two interflavan linkages
  (C–C and C–O).
- Blueberries contain both A- and B-type PACs.
- B-type PACs in blueberry consist of dimers and higher oligomers of flavan-3-ol units
  linked through the C4–C8 bond and/or the C4–C6 bond (Hellstrom et al.
- 2007).
- A-type PACs which are abundant in blueberries are flavan-3-ol units linked by additional
  ether bond between C2 and O7 (Gu et al.
- 2003) with B-type.
- It has been reported that blueberries have potential for type 2 diabetes prevention
  via carbohydrate-hydrolyzing enzyme inhibition (Wang et al.
- 2012).
- However, the source of the responsible bioactivities is not clear.
- Identification of the bioactive fraction for the inhibition of carbohydrate-hydrolyzing
  enzymes will assist in better understanding of blueberries utilization for the prevention
  of type 2 diabetes.
- The aim of this study was (1) to evaluate the inhibitory activity of blueberry extract
  against rat alpha-glucosidase, sucrase, and maltase and (2) to determine the true
  source of the responsible bioactivities between PACs and LMW phenolics.
- Freeze-dried whole blueberry powder was obtained from the U.S. Highbush Blueberry
  Council (Foslom, CA).
- The freeze-dried powder was kept at −4 °C until use.
- All solvents used for research were of either ACS or HPLC grade and were purchased
  from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, Mo, USA).
- Rat intestinal acetone powder and all other reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
  (St. Louis, MO, USA).
- Five grams of blueberry powder were extracted with 100 mL of acetone solution which
  contained acetone, deionized water, and hydrochloric acid in the following volume
  ratio 70:29.9:0.01 for 2 h at room temperature with continuous stirring.
- 'After the extraction with acetone solution, extracts were vacuum filtered through
  a Whatman #2 (Whatman Inc.; Florham, NJ, USA) and evaporated to a final volume of
  25 mL by a rotary evaporator (Fisher Scientific; Hanover Park, IL).The extract was
  stored at −4 °C until further testing.'
- The resulting extract (25 mL) was subjected to solid phase extraction using C18
  cartridge (DSC-18, 3 mL Tube, 500 mg; Supelco, Bellefonte, PA, USA).
- A subsample (2 mL) of the extract was loaded onto each pre-conditioned C18 cartridge,
  followed by rinsing with deionized water to eliminate hydrophilic compounds.
- After washing, the hydrophobic compounds (including phenolic compounds) were eluted
  with 5 mL of 99:1 (v/v) methanol:acetic acid solution.
- The solvent was evaporated from the hydrophobic fraction using a rotary evaporator
  (Fisher Scientific; Hanover Park, IL, USA) at 60 °C to yield a final volume of 25
  mL.
- The evaporated extract was stored at −4 °C until further testing.
- Roto-evaporated acetone extract was subjected to gel filtration chromatography using
  LH-20 (Sigma Lipophilic Sephadex; St. Louis, MO, USA) column extraction to separate
  the low-molecular weight phenolic compounds from the high-molecular weight PACs.
- Five mL each of concentrated extracts was loaded onto 40 mL LH-20 column, which
  has been conditioned by washing with 200 mL of 30 % methanol.
- The column was washed with 500 mL of 30 % methanol to collect low-molecular weight
  phenolic compounds (such as phenolic acids, anthocyanin, and flavonoids) and with
  150 mL of acetone:deionized water:acetic acid (70:29.9:0.01) (v/v), the PAC-containing
  fraction was eluted.
- Both resulting fractions were roto-evaporated by vacuum rotor evaporator (Fisher
  Scientific; Hanover Park, IL, USA) to final volume of 25 mL and then stored at 4
  °C until further testing.
- Total phenolic content of all extracts was determined by Folin–Ciocalteau’s reagent
  (Sigma-Aldrich; St. Louis, MO, USA).
- Briefly, 1 mL of sample or standard was mixed with 1 mL of 95 % ethanol, 5 mL deionized
  water, and 1 mL of 1 N Folin–Ciocalteu reagent (Sigma-Aldrich; St. Louis, MO, USA)
  in test tubes.
- Then the tubes were incubated at room temperature for 5 min.
- After adding 1 mL of 5 % Na2CO3 into mixture, the mixture was stored at room temperature
  for 60 min in the absence of light.
- The absorbance was measured at 725 nm (U 2001 Spectrophotometer; Hitachi, Pleasanton,
  CA, USA) after vortexing.
- Gallic acid standard was prepared (15.625, 31.25, 62.5, 125, 250, and 500 μg/mL
  in ethanol) and used to establish the standard curve.
- Results were expressed as mg of gallic acid equivalents per gram of sample (DW).
- Total PAC contents were determined by the use of 4-dimethylaminocinnamaldehyde (DMAC)
  (Sigma-Aldrich; St. Louis, MO, USA).
- DMAC reagent was prepared with 1:1 6 N H2SO4 and 2 % DMAC (w/v) in methanol.
- 20 μL of samples/standard, 2,380 μL of methanol, and 100 μL of DMAC reagent were
  added in cuvettes.
- The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 20 min.
- The absorbance of the mixture was observed at 640 nm (U 2001 Spectrophtometer; Hitachi,
  Pleasanton, CA, USA).
- The calibration curve was established using PAC type A standards (Chromadex; Irvine,
  CA, USA) at concentrations of 0, 30, 50, 80, and 100 μg/mL in ethanol.
- Results were expressed as mg of PAC type A equivalents per 1 mL of sample.
- All samples were dissolved in water.
- A total of 0.3 g rat intestinal acetone powder was mixed with 9 mL of 0.9 % saline
  and sonicated (1510E-DTH12; Baransonic, Danbury, CT, USA) 12 times for 30 s at 4
  °C.
- After centrifugation (10,000_g_, 20 min, 4 °C) (Accuspin Micro 17R; Fisher Scientific,
  Hanover Park, IL, USA) of the mixture, the supernatant was used as an enzyme mixture.
- 50 μL of sample or buffer and 100 μL of the enzyme mixture were added into a 96
  microplate well.
- After incubation at 37 °C for 10 min, 50 μL of 5 mM _p_-nitrophenyl-_α_-d-glucopyranoside
  (pNPG) in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) was added into each microplate
  well.
- In blank, 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) was added for substrate instead
  of 5 mM pNPG.
- After incubation for 30 min, the absorbance of each mixture was measured at 405
  nm and compared to the control using a microplate reader (Molecular Devices; Thermo
  max, Ramsey, MN, USA).

  All samples were filtered using a 0.45 μm Fisherbrand® syringe filter (Thermo Fisher
  Sci, Pittsburg, PA).'
- An injection volume of 20 μL of each sample was injected and analyzed using a reverse
  phase C-18 column (Agilent ZORBAX Extend C-18 column, 250 × 4.6 mm id.d, 5 µm particle
  size).
- The mobile phase consisted of solvent A (4 % phosphoric acid) and solvent B (acetonitrile).
- Gradient elution was used under linear gradient conditions starting with 95 % A,
  decreasing to 65 % A over a 70-min time period at a flow rate of 0.75 mL/min.
- Phenolic and anthocyanin profiles were observed at 254 and 520 nm, respectively.
- All experiments were performed at least three times in triplicates.
- Analysis at every time point from each experiment was carried out in triplicates.
- Means, standard errors, standard deviations, and IC50 values were calculated using
  Microsoft Excel XP.
- The total phenolic content (Fig.
- 1a) of the resulting blueberry extracts was evaluated using Folin–Ciocalteau’s assay.
- In blueberry extracts, the total phenolic contents of BAE, BAE-LMW and BAE-PAC were
  determined to be 3.88, 1.90, and 1.85 mg/mL, respectively.
- The total phenolic content results indicate that blueberry acetone extract contains
  both low MW phenolic compounds as well as PACs.
- Although the phenolic contents were similar between the BAE-LMW and BAE-PAC, the
  phenolic profiles were considered to be different.
- Demiray et al.
- (2009) previously reported that acetone is an appropriate solvent to extract phenolic
  compounds and that elution solvents used in LH-20 column can affect the profile
  of received fractions.
- 'Total phenolic contents (a) and PAC contents (b) of blueberry extract and resulting
  fractions




  The PAC content was determined in BAE, and the resulting BAE-PAC and BAE-LMW using
  the DMAC assay.'
- Our findings show that the majority of PACs were eluted in the BAE-PAC fraction
  (Fig.
- 1b).
- More specifically, the determined PAC contents were 0.86 mg/mL PAC A2 eq., 0.11
  mg/mL PAC A2 eq.
- and 0.61 mg/mL PAC A2 eq., for BAE, BAE-LMW and BAE-PAC samples, respectively (Fig.
- 1b).
- Previous reports demonstrated that LH-20 column is a suitable method for PAC purification
  (Jarkko and Pirjo 2008; Lee 2013).
- Lee (2013), evaluated five methods for PAC purification, and the results showed
  that size exclusion resins such as Toyopearl 40C and Sephadex LH-20 were the most
  suitable to purify PACs.
- Our findings are in agreement with previous reports, supporting that LH-20 column
  is suitable for PAC purification.
- The dose-dependent rat _α_-glucosidase inhibitory activities of BAE, BAAE-LMW, and
  BAE-PAC were investigated (Figs.
- 2, 3).
- For comparison purposes and to determine whether the observed bioactivity is PAC
  dependent, the inhibitory activities were expressed either based on total phenolic
  or PAC contents.
- Due to the low PAC contents observed in BAE-LMW fraction (Fig.
- 1b), the inhibitory activity of this fraction was not expressed based on PAC content.
- Our observations suggest that at the tested doses, all samples had significant rat
  alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity (Figs.
- 2, 3).
- However, to assess the efficacy of the inhibition and understand whether the observed
  effect is PAC or low-molecular weight phenolic dependent, the IC50 values on both
  total phenolic basis and PAC basis were determined (Table 1).
- It was determined that the IC50 values for BAE were 0.390 mg/mL (TP basis) and 0.090
  mg/mL (PAC basis) (Table 1).
- BAE-LMW fraction had higher inhibitory activity with IC50 value of 0.242 mg/mL (TP
  basis), while the BAE-PAC fraction had reduced inhibitory activity with observed
  IC50 values of 0.915 mg/mL (TP basis) and 0.299 mg/mL (PAC basis) (Table 1).

- "a BAE, b BAE-PAC\n\n\nIC50 values of blueberry extract and fractions against rat
  _α_-glucosidase, maltase, and sucrase (TP and PAC basis)  \n\n\nOur findings suggest
  that the observed rat alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity is not PAC dependent,
  since the PAC basis IC50 value of BAE-PAC is higher when compared to the BAE (Table
  1)."
- The results also indicated that the observed inhibitory activity is dependent on
  lower molecular weight phenolics, based on the lower TP basis IC50 value of BAE-LWM
  fraction than that of BAE (Table 1).
- This is probably because non-bioactive higher MW phenolics have been removed and
  absent in BAE-LMW.
- It is well documented that phenolic phytochemicals have alpha-glucosidase inhibitory
  activity that depends on the phenolic profile (Kwon et al.
- 2006, 2007; Apostolidis et al.
- 2012).
- A recent study reported that cinnamon extract has shown non-PAC-dependent rat alpha-glucosidase
  inhibitory activity (Kang et al.
- 2014).
- Our observations were consistent with cinnamon, showing the inhibitory activity
  of blueberry acetone extract on rat alpha-glucosidase, which is attributed to lower
  molecular weight phenolic phytochemicals with no PAC dependency.
- To further confirm this observation, the specific sucrase and maltase inhibitory
  activities of BAE, BAE-LMW, and BAE-PAC were also investigated.
- The dose-dependent maltase inhibitory activities of BAE, BAE-LWM, and BAE-PAC were
  evaluated as outlined in materials and methods.
- At the tested doses, only BAE and BAE-LMW extracts showed significant inhibitory
  activity (Figs.
- 4, 5).
- The IC50 values were evaluated for tested samples, on both total phenolics and PAC
  basis (Table 1).
- It was determined that the IC50 values for BAE were 0.124 mg/mL (TP basis) and 0.026
  mg/mL (PAC basis) (Table 1).
- As observed with alpha-glucosidase, BAE-LMW fraction had higher inhibitory activity
  with IC50 value of 0.070 mg/mL (TP basis), while the BAE-PAC fraction had very low
  inhibitory activity resulting in IC50 values of &gt;1.853 mg/mL (TP basis) and &gt;0.303
  mg/mL (PAC basis) (Table 1).

- 'a BAE, b BAE-PAC


  These observations of maltase inhibitory activity in blueberry extracts confirm
  the findings from rat _α_-glucosidase inhibitory activity, since BAE-PAC fraction
  has no inhibitory activity at the tested doses.'
- In addition, the BAE-LMW fraction had higher inhibitory activity on TP basis, when
  compared to that of BAE.
- These findings suggest that the observed maltase inhibitory activity of BAE is attributed
  to lower molecular weight phenolics.
- The dose-dependent maltase inhibitory activities of BAE, BAE-LWM, and BAE-PAC were
  evaluated as outlined in materials and methods.
- All evaluated samples showed significant inhibitory activity at the tested doses
  (Figs.
- 6, 7).
- The IC50 values for BAE were 0.027 mg/mL (TP basis) and 0.006 mg/mL (PAC basis)
  (Table 1).
- As observed with alpha-glucosidase, BAE-LMW fraction had higher inhibitory activity
  with an IC50 value of 0.016 mg/mL (TP basis), while the BAE-PAC fraction had reduced
  inhibitory activity with observed IC50 values of 0.889 mg/mL (TP basis) and 0.291
  mg/mL (PAC basis) (Table 1).

- 'a BAE, b BAE-PAC


  These observations confirm our previous findings that the observed inhibitory activity
  of blueberry extract on carbohydrate-hydrolyzing enzymes depends on low-molecular
  weight phenolic compounds.'
- It is also noteworthy that the observed sucrase inhibitory activities with BAE and
  BAE-LMW were significantly higher than those on maltase (Table 1).
- This suggests that the observed carbohydrate-hydrolyzing enzyme inhibitory activity
  of blueberry acetone extract is mainly due to sucrase inhibition.
- The phenolic profiles of BAE, BAE-LMW, and BAE-PAC at different wavelengths (254
  and 520 nm) were determined as described in the materials and methods.
- Our results showed as expected different phenolic profiles between the evaluated
  samples (Figs.
- 8, 9).
- More specifically, we observed that the majority of phenolic compounds present in
  BAE eluted in the BAE-LMW fraction.
- In the BAE-LMW fraction, the major peak was eluted around 17 min and the vast majority
  of other compounds eluted between 20 and 30 min (Fig.
- 8).
- The compound eluted at 17 min had a λmax at 254 nm, suggesting that it is a phenolic
  acid, while the compounds eluted between 20 and 30 min had _λ_max at 520 nm, suggesting
  that they are anthocyanins (Fig.
- 9).
- In the case of BAE-PAC fraction, the observed compounds eluted around 26, 31, 32,
  38, and 39 min (Fig.
- 8).
- All these compounds were absent in the BAE-LMW fraction but present in the BAE phenolic
  profile.
- Based on our in vitro and HPLC observations, we can suggest that the bioactive components
  of blueberry acetone extract are considered to be either phenolic acids or anthocyanins,
  both of which are present in the BAE-LMW fraction.
- Further fractionation of the BAE-LMW is underway to separate and characterize phenolic
  acids and anthocyanins responsible for the observed effect.
- In conclusion, our findings suggest that the inhibitory potential of blueberry extract
  against carbohydrate-hydrolyzing enzymes is shown to be attributed to low-molecular
  weight phenolics rather than PACs.
- Specifically phenolic acids and anthocyanins present in blueberries are considered
  to contribute to the bioactivity.
- Finally, we observed that blueberry extracts have shown higher inhibitory activity
  on sucrase, with much less on maltase.
- Our current findings provide a sound rationale for further fractionation, characterization,
  and evaluation of the low-molecular weight phenolic compounds present in blueberries,
  which will assist in better understanding the potential of blueberry bioactives
  for type 2 diabetes prevention.
- The ultimate goal of this work will be the development of the appropriate extraction
  and standardization procedures for the manufacture of a blueberry extract for type
  2 diabetes prevention, to be used either in dietary supplements or food products.
