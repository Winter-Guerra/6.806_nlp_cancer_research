- Since eradication of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is thought to be a preventive
  measure against stomach cancer, several studies have examined factors associated
  with the infection.
- This paper reports the association of the infection with lifestyle factors observed
  in a hospital-based case-control study.
- Cases were 140 anti-H. pylori IgG antibody-positive outpatients (75 males and 65
  females).
- Controls were 52 antibody-negative outpatients (22 males and 30 females).
- Both groups had undergone gastroscopy at Aichi Cancer Center Hospital between February
  1995 and February 1997, and lifestyle data collected on the first visit were linked
  to calculate odds ratios.
- A strong association was observed with smoking among males; age-adjusted odds ratio
  (OR) = 7.85, 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.03-30.4.
- Rice breakfast (OR = 3.74; 95% CI, 1.30-10.8) and soybean paste soup (every day
  vs. occasionally, OR = 5.24; 95% CI, 1.80-15.2) were also associated with antibody
  positivity in males, but not in females.
- In females, pickled Chinese cabbage (&gt; or = 1/week vs. &lt; or = 3/month, OR
  = 2.82; 95% CI, 1.06-7.48) and lettuce (&gt; or = 1/week vs. &lt; or = 3/month,
  OR = 2.90; 95% CI, 1.09-7.76) were significantly associated with positivity.
- Multivariate analysis gave similar estimates for the above factors.
- Although the association between smoking and H. pylori infection has not been detected
  in past studies of a general population, except one recent one, this study on outpatients
  suggested a possible association.
- Smoking may work as a cofactor disturbing incidental eradication of H. pylori by
  antibacterial agents administered for other reasons.
