- Development of dairy organic probiotic fermented products is of great interest as
  they associate ecological practices and benefits of probiotic bacteria.
- As organic management practices of cow milk production allow modification of the
  fatty acid composition of milk (as compared to conventional milk), we studied the
  influence of the type of milk on some characteristics of fermented milks, such as
  acidification kinetics, bacterial counts and fatty acid content.
- Conventional and organic probiotic fermented milks were produced using _Bifidobacterium
  animalis_ subsp.
- _lactis_ HN019 in co-culture with _Streptococcus thermophilus_ TA040 and _Lactobacillus
  delbrueckii_ subsp.
- _bulgaricus_ LB340.
- The use of organic milk led to a higher acidification rate and cultivability of
  _Lactobacillus bulgaricus_.
- Fatty acids profile of organic fermented milks showed higher amounts of _trans_-octadecenoic
  acid (C18:1, 1.6 times) and polyunsaturated fatty acids, including _cis_-9 _trans_-11,
  C18:2 conjugated linoleic (CLA-1.4 times), and Î±-linolenic acids (ALA-1.6 times),
  as compared to conventional fermented milks.
- These higher levels were the result of both initial percentage in the milk and increase
  during acidification, with no further modification during storage.
- Finally, use of bifidobacteria slightly increased CLA relative content in the conventional
  fermented milks, after 7 days of storage at 4 °C, whereas no difference was seen
  in organic fermented milks.
