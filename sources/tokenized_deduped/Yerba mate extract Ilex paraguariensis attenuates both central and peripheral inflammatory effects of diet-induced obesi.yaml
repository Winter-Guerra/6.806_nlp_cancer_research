- To clarify the effects of natural dietary components on the metabolic consequences
  of obesity, we examined the effects of yerba mate extract _Ilex paraguariensis_
  on both central and peripheral inflammatory effects of diet-induced obesity and
  correlated the hypothalamic tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-Î± level with adipose depot
  weight.
- 'Wistar rats were divided into four groups: a control group (CTL) fed with chow
  diet, a second group fed with chow diet plus yerba mate extract (CTL+E), a third
  group fed with a high-fat diet rich in saturated fatty acids (HFD) and a fourth
  group fed with HFD plus yerba mate extract (HFD+E).'
- Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, Western blotting, colorimetric method and treatment
  by gavage were utilized as materials and methods.
- The HFD groups showed a significant increase in food intake (kcal), body weight,
  adipose tissue and leptin level in comparison to CTL and CTL+E.
- HFD leads to increase of both central and peripheral inflammatory effects, and deregulation
  of insulin pathway.
- In addition, yerba mate extract intake blunted the proinflammatory effects of diet-induced
  obesity in rats by reducing the phosphorylation of hypothalamic IKK and NFÎºBp65
  expression and increasing the protein levels of IÎºB_Î±_, the expression of adiponectin
  receptor-1 and consequently the amount of IRS-2.
- Moreover, the increase in interleukin (IL)-6 levels in the liver and muscle and
  of the IL-10/TNF-Î± ratio in groups that received yerba mate extract showed the
  anti-inflammatory effects of this natural substance.
- Taken together, our data suggest that the use of yerba mate extract may be useful
  for reducing low-grade obesity-associated inflammation.
