- Previous investigations found high dairy intakes in girls associated with rapid
  height growth and excess weight gain, which had opposite relationships with benign
  breast disease (BBD) in young women.
- We use data from the longitudinal Growing Up Today Study (GUTS) to investigate whether
  dairy intakes, in older children/adolescents, are associated with BBD risk in young
  women.
- GUTS includes 9,039 females, ages 9–15 years in 1996, who completed questionnaires
  annually through 2001, then in 2003, 2005, 2007, and 2010.
- Dietary food frequencies (1996–2001) obtained milk, yogurt, and cheese intakes.
- On 2005–2010 surveys, 7,011 females (18–29 years) reported whether a health care
  provider ever diagnosed them with BBD (_n_ = 250) and if confirmed by breast biopsy
  (_n_ = 105).
- Logistic regression models estimated associations between prevalent biopsy-confirmed
  BBD and dairy intakes, adjusted for age and energy.
- Multivariable-adjusted models additionally included menarche age, childhood adiposity,
  adolescent alcohol consumption, and pregnancy.
- Further analyses stratified by family history.
- 'Age-energy–adjusted models of dairy (milk, yogurt, cheese, total dairy servings,
  dairy protein, dairy fat) intakes at 14 yr found no significant associations with
  BBD risk [milk: OR, 0.90/(serving/d); 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.76–1.05; dairy
  protein: OR, 0.98/(10 g/d); 95% CI, 0.82–1.17).'
- Separate analyses of dairy intakes at 10 yr, intakes before the growth spurt, during
  the growth spurt, before menses-onset, and after menses-onset provided no significant
  associations with BBD.
- Multivariable adjustment, and family history stratification, did not alter the above
  findings.
- We conclude that dairy intakes by older girls have no strong relation with BBD risk
  in young women.
- Because of small number of cases, it is important to continue follow-up and re-examine
  later.
