- 3,3′-diindolylmethane (DIM) is an acid-catalyzed dimer of idole-3-carbinol (I3C),
  a phytochemical found in cruciferous vegetables that include broccoli, Brussels
  sprouts and cabbage.
- DIM is an aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) ligand and a potential anticancer agent,
  namely for the treatment of breast cancer.
- It is also advertised as a compound that regulates sex hormone homeostasis.
- Here we make use of RNA expression assays coupled to Chromatin Immunoprecipitation
  (ChIP) in breast cancer cell lines to study the effect of DIM on estrogen signaling.
- We further make use of growth assays, as well as fluorescence-activated cell sorting
  (FACS) assays, to monitor cell growth.
- In this study, we report that ‘physiologically obtainable’ concentrations of DIM
  (10 μM) activate the estrogen receptor α (ERα) signaling pathway in the human breast
  cancer cell lines MCF7 and T47D, in a 17β-estradiol (E2)-independent manner.
- Accordingly, we observe induction of ERα target genes such as _GREB1_ and _TFF1_,
  and an increase in cellular proliferation after treatment with 10 μM DIM in the
  absence of E2.
- By using an ERα specific inhibitor (ICI 182 780), we confirm that the transcriptional
  and proliferative effects of DIM treatment are mediated by ERα.
- We further show that the protein kinase A signaling pathway participates in DIM-mediated
  activation of ERα.
- In contrast, higher concentrations of DIM (e.g.
- 50 μM) have an opposite and expected effect on cells, which is to inhibit proliferation.
- We document an unexpected effect of DIM on cell proliferation, which is to stimulate
  growth by inducing the ERα signaling pathway.
- Importantly, this proliferative effect of DIM happens with potentially physiological
  concentrations that can be provided by the diet or by taking caplet supplements.
- Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of death in industrialized countries
  and estrogens are known to play a role in its promotion [1].
- Initiation of breast cancer by 17β-estradiol (E2) can involve the formation of DNA
  damage via its oxidation products.
- Accordingly, E2 is a substrate for the phase I cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, CYP1A1
  and CYP1B1.
- These two enzymes oxidize E2 into 2-hydroxyestradiol (2-OHE2) and 4-hydroxyestradiol
  (4-OHE2), respectively [2,3].
- The 2-OHE2 metabolites can bind estrogen receptor α (ERα), but do not induce transcriptional
  activity [4].
- On the other hand, 4-OHE2 hydroxylation results in the formation of a carcinogenic
  metabolite that can be further oxidized to highly reactive semiquinones and quinines
  [5].
- These C-4 metabolites are well characterized and known to produce DNA adducts that
  lead to depurination of DNA [6-9].
- CYP1B1 has been found in high concentrations in many types of tumors compared to
  normal tissues [10].
- These observations suggest a function for CYP1B1 in promoting tumor growth.
- To support this hypothesis, the expression of _CYP1B1_ has been observed in mammary
  tissue many weeks prior to the appearance of tumors in DMBA-treated rats [11].
- Furthermore, in normal mammary tissue, 2-OHE2-derived metabolites are the main conversion
  products of E2, while a significant increase of 4-OHE2-derived metabolites is observed
  in cancerous mammary tissue.
- Based on these observations, a model has been put forth wherein the CYP1A1/CYP1B1
  enzyme ratio is essential to control the intracellular level of genotoxic estrogen
  metabolites [12].
- The _CYP1A1_ and _CYP1B1_ genes are expressed primarily in extra-hepatic tissue
  and are regulated by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a ligand-activated transcription
  factor that belongs to the bHLH/PAS family.
- AhR ligands are numerous and belong to several classes of chemicals including halogenated
  aromatic hydrocarbons (HAH) such as 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD),
  polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) such as benzopyrene, and phytochemicals found
  in cruciferous vegetables like 3,3′-diindolylmethane (DIM).
- Female rodents exposed to TCDD for two years showed an increase in liver cancer
  incidence but a decrease in spontaneous mammary tumor formation [13].
- Later studies revealed that TCDD and other AhR ligands inhibit cellular proliferation
  of human breast cancer cell lines, [14,15] as well as DMBA-induced mammary tumors
  in rats [16], and, consequently, these observations highlight a possible functional
  crosstalk between AhR and ERα signaling.
- The potential role of the AhR signaling pathway in mammary carcinogenesis inhibition
  led to the development of selective AhR modulators (SAhRMs) that act as potential
  anticancer agents.
- Even if TCDD possesses chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic proprieties in breast
  cancer development, it also induces acute liver toxicity.
- SAhRMs, like DIM, are reported to have the same inhibitory effects on mammary tumor
  formation in rats without having the deleterious effects of TCDD and other toxic
  AhR ligands.
- DIM is an acid-catalyzed dimer of indol-3-carbonyl (I3C), a compound found in cruciferous
  vegetables such as broccoli, Brussels sprouts and cabbage.
- DIM is one of the most biologically active products examined so far [17], and because
  of its potential chemotherapeutic functions, it has been extensively studied.
- Reports showed that DIM treatment induces a G1 arrest in the cell cycle of breast,
  ovarian, prostate, and colon cancer cell lines [18-23].
- In addition, DIM also induces apoptosis and _p21_ expression in a p53-independent
  manner [24-26], and is a low affinity ligand for AhR.
- However, conflicting reports can be found in the literature as to whether DIM is
  an agonist or an antagonist of AhR in the expression of the _CYP1_ family of genes
  [27-31].
- Furthermore, DIM activates ERα in a ligand-independent manner, which involves the
  protein kinase A (PKA) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways
  under certain conditions [32].
- As a natural compound, DIM can easily be taken as a dietary supplement.
- However, information regarding heavy DIM supplementation is scarce, and whether
  or not DIM use is safe on a long-term basis is not known.
- In this study, we compare the effects of two concentrations of DIM on the expression
  of AhR and ERα target genes, as well as test their impact on AhR-ERα crosstalk.
- We chose a lower concentration of DIM (10 μM; thereafter the ‘low concentration’),
  which can theoretically be reached in the human body by a ‘heavy eater’ of cruciferous
  vegetables, and a higher concentration (50 μM; thereafter the ‘high concentration’),
  which is known to possess strong anti-proliferative effects in cancer cells.
- Our results indicate an opposite dose-dependent effect of DIM in MCF7 and T47D cells
  in the absence of E2.
- At the high concentration, DIM inhibits cell proliferation and induces both _p21_
  and _CYP1A1_ gene expression.
- At the low concentration, in the absence of E2, DIM acts as an estrogen mimetic
  and induces ERα target gene expression and concomitant cellular proliferation.
- Moreover, we find that the estrogenic effects observed following DIM treatment are
  mediated by ERα and the PKA signaling pathway.

- Results are shown as percent of input.
- Cells were seeded in 48-well plates at a density of 1.5 × 104 cells per well in
  estrogen-free media for three days and then treated with either DMSO; 100 nM E2;
  10 μM DIM; 50 μM DIM; 50 μM ICI; 10 μM H89; 10 μM DIM and 50 μM ICI; or 10 μM DIM
  and 10 μM H89.
- Medium was replaced every two days.
- At each time point, cells were collected, fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 15 min,
  and kept in 0.4% formaldehyde/PBS 1X at 4°C until the last end point was reached.
- The cells were then washed once with sterile distilled water and colored with 0.5
  mL of 0.1% crystal violet in 10% ethanol for 20 min.
- The cells were washed three times with sterile distilled water and allowed to air

- The dye was extracted with 0.5 mL of 10% acetic acid for 20 min.
- Absorbance was measured at 590 nm in 96-well plates.
- The values are presented as fold over day 0\.
- Each treated time-point is the average of nine wells from three independent experiments

  HCl pH 7.0, and treated successively with RNase A and proteinase K. Finally, the
  cells were resuspended in Sytox Green (Life Technologies) dye at a final concentration
  of 1 μM in the same buffer.
- Samples were analysed by flow cytometry on a Becton Dickinson FACScalibur cytometer.
- For each sample, ten thousand cells were plotted on a histogram with FL-1 on the
  X-axis and gates were set to distinguish cells in G1, S, G2/M and sub-G1-phases
  of the cell cycle.
- Data in the figure are expressed as a percentage of all gated cells in the sample
  and represent the average and standard error of triplicate experiments.
- _CYP1A1_ expression was first measured in MCF7 breast cancer cells that were grown
  in estrogen-free medium for three days and then treated with either 10 nM TCDD or
  50 μM DIM, alone, or in combination with 100 nM E2 for 24 h. Co-treatment of cells
  with E2 and TCDD typically decreased _CYP1A1_ activation by 60% when compared to
  TCDD alone (Figure 1A; [33]).
- Following DIM treatment, _CYP1A1_ activity reached levels similar to those found
  in TCDD + E2 treated cells.
- Addition of E2 produced no effect on DIM-induced _CYP1A1_ expression (Figure 1A).
- 'Similar results were also obtained in T47D cells, but we observed a more modest
  repression effect by E2, as well as weaker activation of _CYP1A1_ (see Additional
  file 1: Figure S1A).'
- 'We also monitored CYP1A1 protein levels upon TCDD treatment of cells, and, as expected,
  the observed effects on transcription correlated with CYP1A1 protein expression
  levels (Additional file 1: Figure S1B).'
- To further investigate this phenomenon, we sought to verify the recruitment of AhR
  and ERα at the _CYP1A1_ proximal promoter by ChIP experiments.
- As expected from the expression results, co-treatment of cells with TCDD and E2
  impairs AhR binding at the _CYP1A1_ promoter as compared to TCDD alone (Figure 1C).
- For the DIM treated cells, we observed no significant variation of AhR binding when
  E2 was added (Figure 1C).
- ERα recruitment to the _CYP1A1_ promoter is known to occur only when AhR and ERα
  signaling pathways are simultaneously activated [34].
- Our results are consistent with this, since ERα is present at the _CYP1A1_ promoter
  only after treatment with TCDD + E2, but not after addition of TCDD alone (Figure
  1D).
- Treatment of cells with DIM alone, or in combination with E2, resulted in the recruitment
  of both AhR (Figure 1C) and ERα (Figure 1D).
- This is consistent with the finding that DIM activates both AhR and ERα signaling
  pathways [30,35].
- Altogether, these results show that _CYP1A1_ expression and AhR and ERα binding
  at the _CYP1A1_ promoter are differentially regulated by TCDD and DIM.
- Figure 1.

- (B) CYP1A1 protein levels are induced by treating cells with 10 μM DIM.
- Immunoblot of CYP1A1 using an anti-CYP1A1 antibody in T47D cells.
- Conditions are as described in (A) using 10 μM DIM or DMSO-treated cells.
- DIM is documented to be a weak AhR ligand when compared to TCDD and has been described
  as an antagonist of AhR-mediated gene transcription [30].
- Considering the repressive effect of ERα on AhR signaling, the activation of ERα
  by DIM treatment might partly explain the weaker induction of _CYP1A1_.
- This scenario could also explain why co-treatment of cells with both TCDD and DIM
  leads to weaker induction of AhR target genes in ERα positive cells [30,36].
- We next wanted to verify if depletion of ERα would allow an increase in _CYP1A1_
  expression after DIM treatment.
- First, MCF7 cells were grown in E2-depleted media for three days and then treated
  with 50 μM ICI 182 780 (a specific ERα inhibitor also known as Fulvestran) for 24
  h prior to the addition of 50 μM DIM for another 24 h. We observed a two-fold increase
  in _CYP1A1_ induction in cells treated with DIM and ICI compared to DIM alone (Figure
  2A).
- 'A similar experiment was performed using T47D breast cancer cells and the results
  obtained (Additional file 2: Figure S2) were very comparable to those obtained in
  Figure 2A.'
- ChIP experiments performed at the _CYP1A1_ promoter using AhR and ERα antibodies
  show that AhR binding increases when cells are co-treated with DIM and ICI 182 780
  (Figure 2B), and that ICI 182 780 prevents ERα from being recruited to _CYP1A1_
  (Figure 2C).
- The latter result is consistent with a previous study that showed that ICI leads
  to ERα degradation [37].
- Overall, our data indicate a dual role of DIM in the regulation of _CYP1A1_ expression.
- On one hand, DIM binds AhR and promotes _CYP1A1_ induction, while on the other,
  DIM triggers ERα activation and represses _CYP1A1_ expression.
- Figure 2.
- ERα degradation increases_CYP1A1_induction in response to DIM.
- (A) Expression analyses were performed in MCF7 cells grown in estrogen-free media
  for three days and treated with 50 μM ICI 182 780 for 24 h prior to the addition
  of 50 μM DIM for 24 h. ChIPs of AhR (B) and ERα (C) were performed in MCF7 cells,
  grown in estrogen-free media for three days and then treated or not with 50 μM ICI
  182 780 for 24 h prior to the addition of 50 μM DIM for 1 h. Results are shown as%
  of Input and represent the mean of three independent experiments with standard deviation.
- 'Additional file 2: Figure S2.'
- ERα degradation increases _CYP1A1_ induction in response to DIM.
- Expression analysis were performed in T47D cells grown in estrogen free media for
  3 days and treated with 50uM ICI 182 780 for 24 h prior addition of 50uM DIM for
  24 h. Results represent the mean of 3 independent experiments with standard deviation.
- In the experiments described above, we used 50 μM DIM, which is considered to be
  very high (the high concentration).
- For instance, Leong and co-workers proposed that a heavy eater of _Brassica_ vegetables
  could reach, under optimal conditions, a DIM blood concentration of approximately
  10 μM [35].
- Thus, we decided to compare a potential physiological concentration of DIM (low
  concentration = 10 μM) with the high concentration (50 μM).
- We treated MCF7 cells grown in estrogen-free media for three days with the low and
  the high concentrations of DIM and then measured the mRNA levels of two AhR target
  genes (_CYP1A1_ and _CYP1B1_), as well as two ERα target genes (_GREB1_ and _TFF1_).
- We observed an increase in gene expression that is directly proportional to DIM
  concentrations for the AhR target genes (Figure 3A and B).
- Strikingly, the low concentration of DIM strongly induces ERα target gene expression,
  whereas the high concentration has almost no effect on the expression of these genes
  (Figure 3C and D).
- 'GREB1 protein levels were also monitored by immunoblotting using cells treated
  with 10 μM DIM (Additional file 3: Figure S3A).'
- The results parallel the mRNA expression levels and show that _GREB1_ is induced
  by 10 μM DIM.
- Taken together, our results suggest that physiological concentrations of DIM stimulate
  transcriptional activity of ERα-dependent genes in the absence of E2 in MCF7 cells.
- 'We also repeated these same experiments in T47D cells and obtained nearly identical
  results (Additional file 3: Figure S3B), a result that shows that these effects
  are not cell-type specific.'
- Figure 3.
- Effects of different concentrations of DIM on AhR and ERα target gene expression.
- mRNA levels of AhR target genes _CYP1A1_(A) and _CYP1B1_(B) and ERα target genes

  are shown as fold over DMSO and represent the mean of three independent experiments
  with standard deviation.

- Effects of different concentrations of DIM on AhR and ERα target gene expressions.
- Protein levels of GREB1 are monitored by immunoblotting (A), mRNA levels of AhR
  target genes _CYP1A1_(B) and _CYP1B1_(C) and ERα target genes _GREB1_(D) and _TFF1_(E)
  were quantified in T47D cells grown in estrogen free media for 3 days, then treated
  with DMSO, 10uM DIM or 50uM DIM for 24 h. Results are showed as fold over DMSO and
  represent the mean of 3 independent experiments with standard deviation.
- A previous study using reporter assays has shown that the activation of ERα by DIM
  is independent of its binding to ERα and involves the PKA signaling pathway and,
  to a lesser extent, the MAPK pathway [32].
- To test the role of the PKA signaling pathway in ERα activation by DIM, we used
  a specific inhibitor of the PKA pathway, H89.
- We measured mRNA levels of _CYP1A1_, which is negatively regulated by ERα, and _GREB1_,
  which is positively regulated by ERα.
- MCF7 cells grown in E2-depleted media were treated with either 100 nM E2, 10 μM
  DIM, 10 μM DIM + 50 μM ICI, or 10 μM DIM + 10 μM H89 for 24 h. Figure 4A shows that
  both the ICI and H89 treatments of cells abrogate the repression mediated by ERα
  on _CYP1A1_ gene expression.
- Conversely, we observed that ICI and H89 abolish the induction of _GREB1_ by DIM
  (Figure 4B).
- 'As with the previous figures, we performed the same experiments in T47D cells and
  obtained comparable results (Additional file 4: Figure S4).'
- In conclusion, DIM mediates ERα activation, at least in large part, via the action
  of the PKA signaling pathway.
- Figure 4.

  h prior addition of DMSO, 100nM E2, 10 μM DIM, 10 μM DIM + 50 μM ICI or 10 μM DIM
  + 10 μM H89 for 24 h. Results are showed as percent of maximum induction and represent
  the mean of 3 independent experiments with standard deviation.
- It is known that high concentrations of DIM (&gt;50 μM) have antiproliferative and
  antitumor properties in almost all cancer cell lines that have been tested [23,24,26].
- Moreover, some of these properties have been proposed to work via induction of the
  _p21_ gene, a key regulator of the cell cycle associated with G1 arrest and senescence
  [38].
- Conversely, since a low dose of DIM activates ERα, it might also promote cellular
  proliferation.
- We thus decided to compare the effect of both DIM concentrations on cellular proliferation.
- We first verified the effect of high and low-dose DIM treatments on the expression
  of _p21_ by RT-qPCR_._ We observe that only the high concentration of DIM induces
  _p21_ expression in MCF7 cells (Figure 5A).
- We then compared MCF7 cell proliferation using crystal violet staining in E2-depleted
  media following three days of treatment with either E2, 10 μM DIM or 50 μM DIM (Figure
  5B).
- Strikingly, the two concentrations of DIM have opposite effects on cellular proliferation.
- On the one hand, a low concentration of DIM stimulates cell growth almost as much
  as E2 treatment.
- On the other hand, a high concentration of DIM inhibits cell growth (Figure 5B).
- To verify that the observed effects of the low concentration of DIM on cellular
  proliferation were mediated by ERα and the PKA pathway, we treated MCF7 cells with
  either ICI or H89, in addition to DIM (Figures 5C, D).
- Both the degradation of ERα and the inhibition of the PKA signaling pathway abrogated
  the proliferative effect of DIM in the absence of E2.
- Similar experiments were conducted in T47D cells with comparable results (Additional
  file 5).
- Figure 5.

- 'In order to further confirm the effects of DIM on the cell cycle, we performed
  cell cycle assays using flow cytometry (FACS) in T47D cells (Additional file 5:
  Figure S5B).'
- The results show that at low concentrations of DIM (10 μM) the percentage of cells
  in S-phase is significantly increased compared to DMSO-treated cells, indicating
  a higher proliferation rate similar to cells treated with E2 (Additional file 6).
- Cells treated with 50 μM DIM tended to have a lower percentage of S-phase cells
  than untreated cells, although the difference was not statistically significant
  (_p_-value = 0.06).
- Finally, we performed a FACS experiment under the same conditions but with MDAMB-232
  cells, which do not express the ERα.
- As expected, DIM has no significant effect (Additional file 6) on cell growth in
  this cell line, confirming that the proliferative effect of DIM is a result of activating
  the ERα pathway.
- In conclusion, we observed that treatment with the low concentration of DIM induced
  breast cancer cell proliferation in the absence of E2, an effect mediated by ERα
  and the PKA signaling pathway.

- AhR ligands have been shown to carry potentially important chemopreventive properties,
  thus understanding the mechanisms behind these properties is fundamental for developing
  cancer therapies.
- DIM has been intensely studied as a possible therapeutic agent in cancer treatment,
  especially for breast cancer.
- Studies report that DIM treatment promotes cellular growth arrest of cancer cells,
  as well as a decrease in mammary tumor formation in DMBA-treated rats [16,24,30].
- Although the use of DIM as a therapeutic agent in the treatment of breast cancer
  is not yet approved, there are active clinical trials that are testing DIM for the
  treatment of many types of cancers (http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=diindolylmethane
  webcite).
- However, DIM can easily be purchased as a dietary supplement and be self-administered.
- As previously mentioned, DIM is a SAhRM that binds AhR, which is involved in the
  regulation of the expression of phase I and II drug metabolizing enzymes.
- Discrepancies are found in the literature as to whether DIM is an agonist or an
  antagonist of AhR [27-31], thus, clarification of this issue is important, especially
  regarding the potentially toxic effect mediated by AhR agonists in the liver following
  AhR activation.
- In this study, we tested how the use of different concentrations of DIM can lead
  to opposite biological outcomes.
- As previously reported, we confirmed that activation of ERα by E2 represses the
  induction of _CYP1A1_ by approximately 60% after TCDD treatment.
- The simultaneous activation of AhR and ERα when cells are treated with DIM does
  not allow full induction of _CYP1A1_.
- Furthermore, addition of E2 to DIM-treated cells has no repressive effect on _CYP1A1_
  expression, which can be explained by the fact that ERα is already fully recruited
  to the _CYP1A1_ promoter after DIM treatment alone.
- We propose that activation of ERα by DIM can explain, at least in part, some discrepancies
  found in the literature on the role of DIM as an agonist/antagonist of AhR in ERα
  positive cell lines [27-31].
- DIM concentrations found in the human body are dependent on the diet.
- Our first experiments were carried out using a concentration of 50 μM, which is
  probably much higher than what can realistically be reached in the body [35].
- We then compared 50 μM DIM with a more physiological concentration of DIM (10 μM)
  and observed that the high concentration of the compound induces the expression
  of AhR target genes (_CYP1A1_ and _CYP1B1_)_,_ while the low concentration shows
  significant effects on the expression of ERα target genes (_GREB1_ and _TFF1_) in
  the absence of E2.
- These observations indicate that at physiological concentrations, DIM principally
  mediates estrogenic effects.
- It can also explain why oral administration of DIM in rodents has no hepatic toxicity
  due to the weak induction of the _CYP1A1_ gene at this low concentration.
- ERα activation can be mediated by direct binding of its main ligand (E2), but it
  can also be induced by the activation of the PKA signaling pathway.
- The phosphorylation of ERα increases its capacity to interact with the transcription
  machinery and triggers the expression of ERα target genes [41-44].
- Accordingly, we were able to demonstrate that the effect of DIM treatment on _CYP1A1_
  and _GREB1_ expression is mediated by ERα, which, in this case, is activated mostly
  by the PKA signaling pathway.
- The estrogen receptor is highly expressed in almost 70% of breast cancer cases and
  its activation promotes cellular proliferation and tumor development [45].
- Our results demonstrate that DIM, at concentrations likely attainable by a diet
  rich in cruciferous vegetables, induces proliferation of MCF7 and T47D breast cancer
  cells in the absence of E2.
- DIM requires that ERα be activated by the PKA signaling pathway to promote cellular
  growth in the absence of E2.
- Consequently, the abundance of ERα, as well as circulating estrogen levels, will
  influence the local effects of DIM on cell growth.
- Altogether, our findings suggest that the use of DIM as a dietary supplement or
  as a therapeutic agent should be undertaken very cautiously as unexpected adverse
  effects could be encountered.
