- Sulforaphane [1-isothiocyanato-4-(methylsulfinyl)-butane] is an isothiocyanate found
  in some cruciferous vegetables, especially broccoli.
- Sulforaphane has been shown to display anti-cancer properties against various cancer
  cell lines.
- Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), which degrades the extracellular matrix (ECM),
  plays an important role in cancer cell invasion.
- In this study, we investigated the effect of sulforaphane on 12-O-tetradecanoyl
  phorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced MMP-9 expression and cell invasion in MCF-7 cells.
- TPA-induced MMP-9 expression and cell invasion were decreased by sulforaphane treatment.
- TPA substantially increased NF-κB and AP-1 DNA binding activity.
- Pre-treatment with sulforaphane inhibited TPA-stimulated NF-κB binding activity,
  but not AP-1 binding activity.
- In addition, we found that sulforaphane suppressed NF-κB activation, by inhibiting
  phosphorylation of IκB in TPA-treated MCF-7 cells.
- In this study, we demonstrated that the inhibition of TPA-induced MMP-9 expression
  and cell invasion by sulforaphane was mediated by the suppression of the NF-κB pathway
  in MCF-7 cells.
