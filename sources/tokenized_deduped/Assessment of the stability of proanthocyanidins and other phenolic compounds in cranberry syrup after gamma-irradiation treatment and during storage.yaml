- Shelf life of commercial cranberry syrup irradiated with gamma radiation at a rate
  of 5 kGy and stored for 6 months at 25 °C and 60% relative humidity (RH) and under
  accelerated stability conditions was investigated.
- High-performance liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionisation quadrupole-time-of-flight
  mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS) was used to characterise cranberry syrup.
- Afterwards, these compounds were quantified by HPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS and 4-dimethylaminocinnamaldehyde
  (DMAC) assay.
- A significant increase in the content of procyanidin B isomer 1 (from 4.4 to 7.0
  Î¼g/ml) and procyanidin A2 (from 83 to 93 Î¼g/ml) was observed after irradiation
  and compared with the non-irradiated syrup.
- Procyanidin B isomers and prodelphinidin were stable at 25 °C during the first month
  of storage, whereas quercetin and some derivatives remained constant for 3 months
  of storage at this temperature.
- In short, after gamma-irradiation in dose of 5 kGy, most compounds were highly stable
  for a month at 25 °C.
