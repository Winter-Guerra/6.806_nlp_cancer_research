- Cd bioaccumulation pattern was investigated in Mediterranean spider crab (_Maya
  squinado_, Herbst, 1788) collected from the northern Adriatic Sea.
- Specimens were caught in the framework of a monitoring plan in order to quantify
  the Cd distribution into different organs and tissues of crab.
- For this purpose, Cd level was studied in appendages, cephalothorax, abdomen as
  well as gonads.
- Cd concentrations were found largely below the Maximum Level (ML) established at
  the European Union (EU) level for muscle from crab appendages (found mean 0.011
  mg kg−1) and approximately amounted to 2% of the EU ML (0.50 mg kg−1).
- The higher Cd concentrations were found in organs and tissues included in crab body
  such as abdomen, chephalotorax and gonads with respect to appendages.
- Chephalotorax showed the highest metal concentration (mean value of 1.19 mg kg−1).
- The possible differences in Cd bioaccumulation rate among crab organs and tissues
  were also investigated applying a parametric linear regression.
- A major Cd bioaccumulation rate was revealed in chephalotorax with respect to other
  analyzed organs and tissues.
- Furthermore, the evaluation of health risk related to human consumption of the Mediterranean
  spider crab has been studied for median of total population, median and 95th percentile
  of consumers of Italy.
- The observed results highlighted that the consumption of organs and tissues included
  in crab body such as abdomen, gonads and, in particular, chephalotorax substantially
  increased the Cd intake reaching also alarming Estimated Weekly Intake (EWI) values
  especially for median and 95th percentile of Italian consumers.
