- The health effects of a Roundup-tolerant NK603 genetically modified (GM) maize (from
  11% in the diet), cultivated with or without Roundup application and Roundup alone
  (from 0.1 ppb of the full pesticide containing glyphosate and adjuvants) in drinking
  water, were evaluated for 2 years in rats.
- This study constitutes a follow-up investigation of a 90-day feeding study conducted
  by Monsanto in order to obtain commercial release of this GMO, employing the same
  rat strain and analyzing biochemical parameters on the same number of animals per
  group as our investigation.
- Our research represents the first chronic study on these substances, in which all
  observations including tumors are reported chronologically.
- Thus, it was not designed as a carcinogenicity study.
- We report the major findings with 34 organs observed and 56 parameters analyzed
  at 11 time points for most organs.
- Biochemical analyses confirmed very significant chronic kidney deficiencies, for
  all treatments and both sexes; 76% of the altered parameters were kidney-related.
- In treated males, liver congestions and necrosis were 2.5 to 5.5 times higher.
- Marked and severe nephropathies were also generally 1.3 to 2.3 times greater.
- In females, all treatment groups showed a two- to threefold increase in mortality,
  and deaths were earlier.
- This difference was also evident in three male groups fed with GM maize.
- All results were hormone- and sex-dependent, and the pathological profiles were
  comparable.
- Females developed large mammary tumors more frequently and before controls; the
  pituitary was the second most disabled organ; the sex hormonal balance was modified
  by consumption of GM maize and Roundup treatments.
- Males presented up to four times more large palpable tumors starting 600 days earlier
  than in the control group, in which only one tumor was noted.
- These results may be explained by not only the non-linear endocrine-disrupting effects
  of Roundup but also by the overexpression of the EPSPS transgene or other mutational
  effects in the GM maize and their metabolic consequences.
- Our findings imply that long-term (2 year) feeding trials need to be conducted to
  thoroughly evaluate the safety of GM foods and pesticides in their full commercial
  formulations.

  There is an ongoing international debate as to the necessary length of mammalian
  toxicity studies, including metabolic analyses, in relation to the consumption of
  genetically modified (GM) plants [1].'
- Currently, no regulatory authority requires mandatory chronic animal feeding studies
  to be performed for edible genetically modified organisms (GMOs), or even short-term
  studies with blood analyses for the full commercial formulations of pesticides as
  sold and used, but only for the declared active principle alone.
- However, several 90-day rat feeding trials have been conducted by the agricultural
  biotechnology industry.
- These investigations mostly concern GM soy and maize that are engineered either
  to be herbicide-tolerant (to Roundup (R) in 80% of cases), or to produce a modified
  Bt toxin insecticide, or both.
- As a result, these GM crops contain new pesticide residues for which new maximum
  residue levels (MRL) have been established in some countries.
- Though the petitioners conclude in general that no major physiological changes is
  attributable to the consumption of the GMO in subchronic toxicity studies [2-5],
  significant disturbances have been found and may be interpreted differently [6,7].
- A detailed analysis of the data in the subchronic toxicity studies [2-5] has revealed
  statistically significant alterations in kidney and liver function that may constitute
  signs of the early onset of chronic toxicity.
- This may be explained at least in part by pesticide residues in the GM feed [6,7].
- Indeed, it has been demonstrated that R concentrations in the range of 103 times
  below the MRL can induce endocrine disturbances in human cells [8] and toxic effects
  thereafter [9].
- This may explain toxic effects seen in experiments in rats _in vivo_[10] as well
  as in farm animals [11].
- After several months of consumption of an R-tolerant soy, the liver and pancreas
  of mice were affected, as highlighted by disturbances in sub-nuclear structure [12-14].
- Furthermore, this toxic effect was reproduced by the application of R herbicide
  directly to hepatocytes in culture [15].
- More recently, long-term and multi-generational animal feeding trials have been
  performed, with some possibly providing evidence of safety, while others conclude
  on the necessity of further investigation because of metabolic modifications [16].
- However, in contrast with the study we report here, none of these previous investigations
  have included a detailed follow-up of the animals, including multiple (up to 11)
  blood and urine sampling over 2 years, and none has investigated either the GM NK603
  R-tolerant maize or Roundup.
- Furthermore, evaluation of long-term toxicity of herbicides is generally performed
  on mammalian physiology employing only their active principle, rather than the complete
  formulations as used in agriculture.
- This was the case for glyphosate (G) [17], the declared active chemical constituent
  of R. It is important to note that G is only able to efficiently penetrate target
  plant organisms with the help of adjuvants present in the various commercially used
  R formulations [18].
- Even if G has shown to interact directly with the active site of aromatase at high
  levels [19], at low contaminating levels, adjuvants may be better candidates than
  G to explain the toxicity or endocrine disruptive side effects of R on human cells
  [8,20] and also _in vivo_ for acute toxicity [21].
- In this regard, it is noteworthy that the far greater toxicity of full agricultural
  formulations compared to declared supposed active principles alone has recently
  been demonstrated also for six other major pesticides tested _in vitro_[22].
- When G residues are found in tap water, food, or feed, they arise from the total
  herbicide formulation although little data is available as to the levels of the
  R adjuvants in either the environment or food chain.
- Indeed, adjuvants are rarely monitored in the environment, but some widely used
  adjuvants (surfactants) such as nonylphenol ethoxylates, another ethoxylated surfactant
  like POEA present in R, are widely found in rivers in England and are linked with
  disruption of wildlife sexual reproduction [23].
- Adjuvants are found in groundwater [24].
- The half-life of POEA (21 to 42 days) is even longer than for G (7 to 14 days) in
  aquatic environments [25].
- As a result, the necessity of studying the potential toxic effects of total chemical
  mixtures rather than single components has been strongly emphasized [26-28].
- On this basis, the regular measurement of only G or other supposed active ingredients
  of pesticides in the environment constitute at best markers of full formulation
  residues.
- Thus, in the study of health effects, exposure to the diluted whole formulation
  may be more representative of environmental pollution than exposure to G alone.
- With a view to address this lack of information, we performed a 2-year detailed
  rat feeding study.
- Our study was designed as a chronic toxicity study and as a direct follow-up to
  a previous investigation on the same NK603 GM maize conducted by the developer company,
  Monsanto [3].
- A detailed critical analysis of the raw data of this subchronic 90-day rat feeding
  study revealed statistically significant differences in multiple organ function
  parameters, especially pertaining to the liver and kidneys, between the GM and non-GM
  maize-fed group [3,7].
- However, Monsanto's authors dismissed the findings as not ‘biologically meaningful’
  [3], as was also the case with another GM corn [29].
- The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) accepted Monsanto's interpretation on
  NK603 maize [30], like in all other cases.
- Our study is the first and to date the only attempt to follow up Monsanto's investigation
  and to determine whether the differences found in the NK603 GM maize-fed rats, especially
  with respect to liver and kidney function, were not biologically meaningful, as
  claimed, or whether they developed into serious diseases over an extended period
  of time.
- The Monsanto authors adapted Guideline 408 of the Organization for Economic Co-operation
  and Development (OECD) for their experimental design [3].
- Our study design was based on that of the Monsanto investigation in order to make
  the two experiments comparable, but we extended the period of observation from Monsanto's
  90 days to 2 years.
- We also used three doses of GMOs (instead of Monsanto's two) and Roundup to determine
  treatment dose response, including any possible non-linear as well as linear effects.
- This allowed us to follow in detail the potential health effects and their possible
  origins due to the direct or indirect consequences of the genetic modification itself
  in the NK603 GM maize, or due to the R herbicide formulation used on the GM maize
  (and not G alone), or both.
- Because of recent reviews on GM foods indicating no specific risk of cancer [2,16],
  but indicating signs of hepatorenal dysfunction within 3 months [1,7], we had no
  reason to adopt a carcinogenesis protocol using 50 rats per group.
- However, we prolonged to 2 years the biochemical and hematological measurements
  and measurements of disease status, as allowed, for example, in OECD protocols 453
  (combined chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity) and 452 (chronic toxicity).
- Both OECD 452 and 453 specify 20 rats per sex per group but require only 50% (ten
  per sex per group, the same number that we used in total) to be analyzed for biochemical
  and hematological parameters.
- Thus, these protocols yield data from the same number of rats as our experiment.
- This remains the highest number of rats regularly measured in a standard GM diet
  study, as well as for a full formulated pesticide at very low environmentally relevant
  levels.
- We used the Sprague-Dawley strain of rat, as recommended for chronic toxicology
  tests by the National Toxicology Program in the USA [31], and as used by Monsanto
  in its 90-day study [3].
- This choice is also consistent with the recommendation of the OECD that for a chronic
  toxicity test, rats of the same strain should be used as in studies on the same
  substance but of shorter duration [32].
- We then also tested for the first time three doses (rather than the two usually
  employed in 90-day protocols) of the R-tolerant NK603 GM maize alone, the GM maize
  treated with R, and R alone at very low environmentally relevant doses, starting
  below the range of levels permitted by regulatory authorities in drinking water
  and in GM feed.
- Overall, our study is the first in-depth life-long toxicology study on the full
  commercial Roundup formulation and NK603 GM maize, with observations on 34 organs
  and measurement of 56 parameters analyzed at 11 time points for most organs, and
  utilizing 3 doses.
- We report here the major toxicological findings on multiple organ systems.
- As there was no evidence in the literature on GM food safety evaluation to indicate
  anything to the contrary, this initial investigation was designed as a full chronic
  toxicity and not a carcinogenicity study.
- Thus, we monitored in details chronologically all behavioral and anatomical abnormalities
  including tumors.
- A full carcinogenicity study, which usually focuses only on observing incidence
  and type of cancers (not always all tumors), would be a rational follow-up investigation
  to a chronic toxicity study in which there is a serious suspicion of carcinogenicity.
- Such indications had not been previously reported for GM foods.
- Our findings show that the differences in multiple organ functional parameters seen
  from the consumption of NK603 GM maize for 90 days [3,7] escalated over 2 years
  into severe organ damage in all types of test diets.
- This included the lowest dose of R administered (0.1 ppb, 50 ng/L G equivalent)
  of R formulation administered, which is well below permitted MRLs in both the USA
  (0.7 mg/L) [33] and European Union (100 ng/L) [34].
- Surprisingly, there was also a clear trend in increased tumor incidence, especially
  mammary tumors in female animals, in a number of the treatment groups.
- Our data highlight the inadequacy of 90-day feeding studies and the need to conduct
  long-term (2 years) investigations to evaluate the life-long impact of GM food consumption
  and exposure to complete pesticide formulations.
- Standard biochemical compositional analysis revealed no particular differences between
  the different maize types and diets, the GM and non-GM maize being classified as
  substantially equivalent, except for transgene DNA quantification.
- For example, there was no difference in total isoflavones.
- In addition, we also assayed for other specific compounds, which are not always
  requested for establishing substantial equivalence.
- This analysis revealed a consistent and statistically significant (_p &lt;_ 0.01)
  decrease in certain phenolic acids in treatment diets, namely ferulic and caffeic
  acids.
- Ferulic acid was decreased in both GM maize and GM maize \+ R diets by 16% to 30%
  in comparison to the control diet (889 ± 107, 735 ± 89, respectively, vs. control
  1,057 ± 127 mg/kg) and caffeic acid in the same groups by 21% to 53% (17.5 ± 2.1,
  10.3 ± 1.3 vs. control 22.1 ± 2.6 mg/kg).
- All rats were carefully monitored during the experiment for behavior, appearance,
  palpable tumors, and infections.
- At least ten organs per animal were weighed and up to 34 analyzed postmortem, at
  the macroscopic and/or microscopic levels (Table 1).
- Due to the large quantity of data collected, it cannot all be shown in one report,
  but we present here the most important findings.
- There was no rejection by the animals of the diet with or without GM maize, nor
  any major difference in body weight (data not shown).
- Table 1.
- 'Protocol used and comparison to existing assessment and to non-mandatory regulatory
  tests


  The most affected organs in males were the liver, hepatodigestive tract, and kidneys
  (Table 2; Figure 1A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I).'
- Liver abnormalities such as hepatic congestions and macroscopic and microscopic
  necrotic foci were 2.5 to 5.5 times more frequent in all treatments than in control
  groups, where only two rats out of ten were affected with one abnormality each.
- For instance, there were 5 abnormalities in total in the GMO 11% group (2.5 times
  higher than controls) and 11 in the GMO 22% group (5.5 times greater).
- In addition, by the end of the experiment, Gamma GT hepatic activity was increased,
  particularly in the GMO + R groups (up to 5.4 times higher), this probably being
  reflective of liver dysfunction.
- Furthermore, cytochrome P450 activity generally increased in the presence of R (either
  in drinking water or in the GM maize-containing diet) according to the dose and
  up to 5.7 times greater at the highest dose.
- Figure 1.
- Anatomopathological observations in rats fed GMO treated or not by Roundup and effects
  of Roundup alone.
- Macroscopic (A to D) and microscopic (A' and C') photographs show male left kidneys
  and livers (E to I) and female pituitaries (J to M), in accordance to Table 2.
- The number of each animal and its treatment is specified.
- Macroscopic pale spots (I) and microscopic necrotic foci in liver (G clear-cell
  focus, H basophilic focus with atypia), and marked or severe chronic progressive
  nephropathies, are illustrated.
- In females, pituitary adenomas (K to M) are shown and compared to control (J, rat
  number and C for control).
- Apostrophes after letters indicate organs from the same rat.
- Transmission electron microscopic observations of liver samples confirmed changes
  for all treated groups in relation to glycogen dispersion or appearance in lakes,
  increase of residual bodies and enlargement of cristae in mitochondria (Figure 2,
  panels 2 to 4).
- The GM maize-fed groups either with or without R application showed a higher heterochromatin
  content and decreased nucleolar dense fibrillar components, implying a reduced level
  of mRNA and rRNA transcription.
- In the GMO + R group (at the highest dose), the smooth endoplasmic reticulum was
  drastically increased and nucleoli decreased in size, becoming more compact.
- In the R alone treatment groups, similar trends were observed, with a partial resumption
  of nucleolar activity at the highest dose.

- Degenerating kidneys with turgid inflammatory areas demonstrated the increased incidence
  of marked and severe chronic progressive nephropathies, which were up to two fold
  higher in the 33% GM maize or lowest dose R treatment groups (Table 2; Figure 1,
  first line).
- Biochemical measurements of blood and urine were focused on samples taken at the
  15th month time point, as this was the last sampling time when most animals were
  still alive (in treated groups 90% males, 94% females, and 100% controls).
- Statistical analysis of results employed OPLS-DA 2-class models built between each
  treated group per sex and controls.
- Only models with an explained variance R2(Y) ≥ 80%, and a cross-validated predictive
  ability Q2(Y) ≥ 60%, were used for selection of the discriminant variables (Figure
  3), when their regression coefficients were significant at a 99% confidence level.
- Thus, in treated females, kidney failures appeared at the biochemical level (82%
  of the total disrupted parameters).
- Levels of Na and Cl or urea increased in urine with a concomitant decrease of the
  same ions in serum, as did the levels of P, K, and Ca.
- Creatinine and creatinine clearance decreased in urine for all treatment groups
  in comparison to female controls (Table 3).
- In GM maize-treated males (with or without R), 87% of discriminant variables were
  kidney-related, but the disrupted profiles were less obvious because of advanced
  chronic nephropathies and deaths.
- In summary, for all treatments and both sexes, 76% of the discriminant variables
  versus controls were kidney-related.

  Furthermore, in females (Table 3), the androgen/estrogen balance in serum was modified
  by GM maize and R treatments (at least 95% confidence level, Figure 3).'
- For male animals at the highest R treatment dose, levels of estrogens were more
  than doubled.
- Tumors are reported in line with the requirements of OECD chronic toxicity protocols
  452 and 453, which require all ‘lesions’ (which by definition include tumors) to
  be reported.
- These findings are summarized in Figure 4.
- The results are presented in the form of real-time cumulative curves (each step
  corresponds to an additional tumor in the group).
- Only the growing largest palpable growths (above a diameter of 17.5 mm in females
  and 20 mm in males) are presented (for example, see Figure 5A,B,C).
- These were found to be in 95% of cases non-regressive tumors (Figure 5D,E,F,G,H,I,J)
  and were not infectious nodules.
- These arose from time to time; then, most often disappeared and were not different
  from controls after bacterial analyses.
- The real tumors were recorded independently of their grade, but dependent on their
  morbidity, since non-cancerous tumors can be more lethal than those of cancerous
  nature, due to internal hemorrhaging or compression and obstruction of function
  of vital organs, or toxins or hormone secretions.
- These tumors progressively increased in size and number, but not proportionally
  to the treatment dose, over the course of the experiment (Figure 4).
- As in the case of rates of mortality (Figure 6), this suggests that a threshold
  in effect was reached at the lower doses.
- Tumor numbers were rarely equal but almost always more than in controls for all
  treated groups, often with a two- to threefold increase for both sexes.
- Tumors began to reach a large size on average 94 days before controls in treated
  females and up to 600 days earlier in two male groups fed with GM maize (11 and
  22% with or without R).
- Figure 4.
- Largest non-regressive tumors in rats fed GMO treated or not by Roundup and effects
  of Roundup alone.
- Rats were fed with NK603 GM maize (with or without application of Roundup) at three
  different doses (11%, 22%, and 33% in their diet; thin, medium, and bold lines,
  respectively) compared to the substantially equivalent closest isogenic non-GM maize
  (control, dotted line).
- Roundup was administered in drinking water at three increasing doses, same symbols,
  environmental (A), MRL in some agricultural GMOs (B), and half of minimal agricultural
  levels (C), see ‘Methods’).
- The largest tumors were palpable during the experiment and numbered from 20 mm in
  diameter for males and 17.5 mm for females.
- Above this size, 95% of growths were non-regressive tumors.
- 'Summary of all tumors are shown in the bar histograms: black, non-regressive large
  tumors; white, small internal tumors; grey, metastases.'
- Figure 5.
- Examples of female mammary tumors observed.
- Mammary tumors are evidenced (A, D, H, representative adenocarcinoma, from the same
  rat in a GMO group) and in Roundup and GMO + Roundup groups, two representative
  rats (B, C, E, F, I, J fibroadenomas) are compared to controls.
- A normal representative rat in controls is not shown, only a minority of them having
  tumors up to 700 days, in contrast with the majority affected in all treated groups.
- (G) The histological control.
- Figure 6.
- Mortality of rats fed GMO treated or not with Roundup and effects of Roundup alone.
- The symbols of curves and treatments are explained in the caption of Figure 4.
- Lifespan during the experiment for the control group is represented by the vertical
  bar ± SEM (grey area).
- In bar histograms, the causes of mortality before the grey area are detailed in
  comparison to the controls (0).
- In black are the necessary euthanasia because of suffering in accordance with ethical
  rules (tumors over 25% body weight, more than 25% weight loss, hemorrhagic bleeding,
  etc.
- ); and in hatched areas, spontaneous mortality.
- In female animals, the largest tumors were in total five times more frequent than
  in males after 2 years, with 93% of these being mammary tumors.
- Adenomas, fibroadenomas, and carcinomas were deleterious to health due to their
  very large size (Figure 5A,B,C) rather than the grade of the tumor itself.
- Large tumor size caused impediments to either breathing or digestion and nutrition
  because of their thoracic or abdominal location and also resulted in hemorrhaging
  (Figure 5A,B,C).
- In addition, one metastatic ovarian cystadenocarcinoma and two skin tumors were
  identified.
- Metastases were observed in only two cases; one in a group fed with 11% GM maize
  and another in the highest dose of R treatment group.
- Up to 14 months, no animals in the control groups showed any signs of palpable tumors,
  whilst 10% to 30% of treated females per group developed tumors, with the exception
  of one group (33% GMO + R).
- By the beginning of the 24th month, 50% to 80% of female animals had developed tumors
  in all treatment groups, with up to three tumors per animal, whereas only 30% of
  controls were affected.
- A summary of all mammary tumors at the end of the experiment, independent of size,
  is presented in Table 2.
- The same trend was observed in the groups receiving R in their drinking water (Figure
  4, R treatment panels).
- The R treatment groups showed the greatest rates of tumor incidence, with 80% of
  animals affected (with up to three tumors for one female), in each group.
- Using a non-parametric multiple comparison analysis, mammary tumor incidence was
  significantly increased at the lowest dose of R compared to controls (_p_ &lt; 0.05,
  Kruskal-Wallis test with _post hoc_ Dunn's test).
- All females except one (with metastatic ovarian carcinoma) presented in addition
  mammary hypertrophies and in some cases hyperplasia with atypia (Table 2).
- The second most affected organ in females was the pituitary gland, in general around
  two times more than in controls for most treatments (Table 2; Figure 1J,K,L,M).
- Again, at this level of examination, adenomas and/or hyperplasias and hypertrophies
  were noticed.
- For all R treatment groups, 70% to 80% of animals presented 1.4 to 2.4 times more
  abnormalities in this organ than controls.
- The large palpable tumors in males (in kidney and mostly skin) were by the end of
  the experimental period on average twice as frequent as in controls, in which only
  one skin fibroma appeared during the 23rd month.
- At the end of the experiment, internal non-palpable tumors were added, and their
  sums were lower in males than in females.
- They were not significantly different from controls, although slightly increased
  in females (Figure 4, histogram insets).
- The rates of mortality in the various control and treatment groups are shown as
  raw data in Figure 6.
- Control male animals survived on average 624 ± 21 days, whilst females lived for
  701 ± 20 days during the experiment, plus in each case, a 5-week starting age at
  reception of animals and a 3-week housing stabilization period.
- After mean survival time had elapsed, any deaths that occurred were considered to
  be largely due to aging.
- Before this period, 30% control males (three in total) and 20% females (only two)
  died spontaneously, while up to 50% males and 70% females died in some groups on
  diets containing the GM maize (Figure 6, panels GMO, GMO + R).
- However, the rate of mortality was not proportional to the treatment dose, reaching
  a threshold at the lowest (11%) or intermediate (22%) amounts of GM maize in the
  equilibrated diet, with or without the R application on the crop.
- It is noteworthy that the first two male rats that died in both GM maize-treated
  groups had to be euthanized due to Wilms' kidney tumors that had grown by this time
  to over 25% of body weight.
- This was approximately a year before the first control animal died.
- The first female death occurred in the 22% GM maize feeding group and resulted from
  a mammary fibroadenoma 246 days before the first control female death.
- The maximum difference in males was five times more deaths occurring by the 17th
  month in the group consuming 11% GM maize and in females six times greater mortality
  by the 21st month on the 22% GM maize diet with and without R. In the female cohorts,
  there were two to three times more deaths in all treated groups compared with controls
  by the end of the experiment and deaths occurred earlier in general.
- Females were more sensitive to the presence of R in drinking water than males, as
  evidenced by a shorter lifespan (Figure 6, panels R).
- The general causes of death represented in histogram format within each of the panels
  in Figure 6, are linked mostly to mammary tumors in females and to problems in other
  organ systems in males.

- 'List of blood and urine paramaters with sampling and unit detail













  This report describes the first long-term (2-year) rodent (rat) feeding study investigating
  possible toxic effects arising from consumption of an R-tolerant GM maize (NK603)
  and a complete commercial formulation of R herbicide.'
- The aims of this investigation were essentially twofold.
- First, to evaluate whether the signs of toxicity, especially with respect to liver
  and kidney functions, seen after 90 days' consumption of a diet containing NK603
  R-tolerant GM maize [3,7] escalated into serious ill health or dissipated over an
  extended period of time.
- Second, to determine if low doses of full commercial R formulation at permitted
  levels were still toxic, as indicated by our previous _in vitro_ studies [8,9].
- The previous toxicity study with NK603 maize employed only this GM crop that had
  been sprayed with R during cultivation [3].
- However, in our study presented here, in addition to extending the treatment period
  from 90 days to 2 years and in order to better ascertain the source of any ill health
  observed, we included additional test feeding groups.
- These consisted of NK603 maize grown without as well as with R application and R
  alone administered via drinking water.
- Furthermore, we used three levels of dosing in all cases rather than the two previously
  used [3], in order to highlight any dose response effects of a given treatment.
- It is also important to note that our study is the first to conduct blood, urine,
  and organ analyses from animals treated with the complete agricultural formulation
  of R and not just G alone, as measured by the manufacturer [35].
- Our data show that the signs of liver and kidney toxicity seen at 90 days from the
  consumption of NK603 GM maize [3,7] do indeed escalate into severe disease over
  an extended period.
- Furthermore, similar negative health effects were observed in all treatment groups
  (NK603 GM maize with or without R application and R alone).
- What is also evident from our data is that ill effects were not proportional to
  the dose of either the NK603 GM maize ± R or R alone.
- This suggests that the observed disease may result from endocrine disruptive effects,
  which are known to be non-monotonic.
- Similar degrees of pathological symptoms occurred from the lowest to the highest
  doses, suggesting a threshold effect [36].
- This corresponds to levels likely to arise from consumption or environmental exposure,
  such as either 11% GM maize in food, or 50 ng/L G equivalent of R-formulation, a
  level which can be found in some contaminated drinking tap waters and which falls
  within authorized limits.
- Death in male rats was mostly due to the development of severe hepatorenal insufficiencies,
  confirming the first signs of toxicity observed in 90-day feeding trials with NK603
  GM maize [7].
- In females, kidney ion leakage was evident at a biochemical level at month 15, when
  severe nephropathies were observed in dead male animals at postmortem, at the anatomopathological
  level.
- Early signs of toxicity at month 3 in kidney and liver were also observed for 19
  edible GM crops containing pesticide residues [1].
- It is known that only elderly male rats are sensitive to chronic progressive nephropathies
  [37].
- Therefore, the disturbed kidney functional parameters may have been induced by the
  reduced levels of phenolic acids in the GM maize feed used in our study, since caffeic
  and ferulic acids are beneficial to the kidney as they prevent oxidative stress
  [38,39].
- This possibility is consistent with our previous observation that plant extracts
  containing ferulic and caffeic acids were able to promote detoxification of human
  embryonic kidney cells after culture in the presence of R [40].
- It is thus possible that NK603 GM maize consumption, with its reduced levels of
  these compounds, may have provoked the early aging of the kidney physiology, similarly
  to R exposure causing oxidative stress [41].
- Disturbances in global patterns of gene expression leading to disease via epigenetic
  effects cannot be excluded, since it has been demonstrated that numerous pesticides
  can cause changes in DNA methylation and histone modification, thereby altering
  chromatin compaction and thus gene expression profiles [42].
- Disturbances that we found to occur in the male liver are characteristic of chronic
  toxicity, confirmed by alterations in biochemical liver and kidney function parameters.
- The observation that liver function in female animals was less negatively affected
  may be due to the known protection from oxidative stress conferred by estrogen [43].
- Estrogen can induce expression of genes such as superoxide dismutase and glutathione
  peroxidase via the MAP kinase-NF-kB signaling pathway, thus providing an antioxidant
  effect [43].
- Furthermore, liver enzymes have been clearly demonstrated as sex-specific in their
  expression patterns, including in a 90-day rat feeding trial of NK603 GM maize [7].
- However, in a long-term study, evidence of early liver aging was observed in female
  mice fed with R-tolerant GM soy [12].
- In the present investigation, deeper analysis at an ultrastructural level revealed
  evidence of impediments in transcription and other defects in cell nuclear structure
  that were comparable in both sexes and dose-dependent in hepatocytes in all treatments.
- This is consistent with the well-documented toxic effect of very low dilutions of
  R on apoptosis, mitochondrial function, and cell membrane degradation, inducing
  necrosis of hepatocytes, and in other cell lines [8,9,44,45].
- The disruptions of at least the estrogen-related pathways and/or enhancement of
  oxidative stress by all treatments need further confirmation.
- This can be addressed through the application of transcriptomic, proteomic, and
  metabolomic methods to analyze the molecular profile of kidneys and livers, as well
  as the GM NK603 maize [46-48].
- Other possible causes of observed pathogenic effects may be due to disturbed gene
  expression resulting from the transgene insertional, general mutagenic, or metabolic
  effects [49,50] as has been shown for MON810 GM maize [51,52].
- A consequent disruption of general metabolism in the GMO cannot be excluded, which
  could lead, for example, to the production of other potentially active compounds
  such as miRNAs [53] or leukotoxin diols [54].
- The lifespan of the control group of animals corresponded to the mean for the strain
  of rat used (Harlan Sprague-Dawley), but as is frequently the case with most mammals,
  including humans [55], males on average died before females, except for some female
  treatment groups.
- All treatments in both sexes enhanced large tumor incidence by two- to threefold
  in comparison to our controls and also the number of mammary tumors in comparison
  to the Harlan Sprague-Dawley strain [56] and overall around threefold in comparison
  to the largest study with 1,329 Sprague-Dawley female rats [57].
- This indicates that the use of historical data to compare our tumor numbers is not
  relevant, first, since we studied the difference with concurrent controls chronologically
  (and not only at the end of the experiment, as is the case in historical data),
  and second, since the diets of historical reference animals may have been contaminated
  with several non-monitored compounds including GMOs and pesticides at levels used
  in our treatments.
- In our study, the tumors also developed considerably faster than in controls, even
  though the majority of tumors were observed after 18 months.
- The first large detectable tumors occurred at 4 and 7 months into the study in males
  and females, respectively, further underlining the inadequacy of the standard 90-day
  feeding trials for evaluating GM crop and food toxicity [1].
- Future studies employing larger cohorts of animals providing appropriate statistical
  power are required to confirm or refute the clear trend in increased tumor incidence
  and mortality rates seen with some of the treatments tested in this study.
- As already stated, our study was not designed as a carcinogenicity study that would
  have required according to OECD the use of 50 rats per sex per group.
- However, we wish to emphasize that the need for more rats to provide sufficient
  statistical power may be biased by the presence of contaminants in the diets used
  in gathering historical control data, increasing artificially the background of
  tumors, which would inappropriately be called in this case ‘spontaneous’ or due
  to the genetic strain.
- For instance, toxic, hormonal disrupting or carcinogenic levels of pesticides, PCBs,
  plasticizers, dioxins, or heavy metals may contaminate the diets or drinking water
  used for the establishment of ‘spontaneous’ tumors in historical data [58-62].
- In females, induced euthanasia due to suffering and deaths corresponded mostly to
  the development of large mammary tumors.
- This was observed independently of the cancer grade but according to impact on morbidity.
- These appeared to be related to the various treatments when compared to the control
  groups.
- These tumors are generally known to be mostly estrogen-dependent [63].
- We observed a strikingly marked induction of mammary tumors in groups administered
  R alone, even at the very lowest dose (50 ng/L G equivalent dilution in adjuvants).
- At this concentration _in vitro_, G alone is known to induce human breast cancer
  cell growth via estrogen receptors [64].
- In addition, R with adjuvants has been shown to disrupt aromatase, which synthesizes
  estrogen [19], and to interfere with estrogen and androgen receptors in cells [8].
- Furthermore, R appears to be a sex endocrine disruptor _in vivo_ in males [10].
- Sex steroid levels were also modified in treated rats in our study.
- These hormone-dependent phenomena are confirmed by enhanced pituitary dysfunction
  in treated females.
- An estrogen-modified feedback mechanism may act at this level [65,66].
- The similar pathological profiles provoked by the GM maize + R diet may thus be
  explained at least in part by R residues present in this feed.
- In this regard, it is noteworthy that the medium dose of the R treatment tested
  (400 mg/Kg G equivalent) corresponds to acceptable residue levels of this pesticide
  in some edible GMOs.
- Interestingly and perhaps surprisingly, in the groups of animals fed with the NK603
  GM maize without R application, similar effects with respect to enhanced tumor incidence
  and mortality rates were observed.
- For instance, comparing the 11% GMO-treated female group to the controls, the assumption
  that the tumors are equally distributed is rejected with a level of significance
  of 0.54% with the Westlake exceedance test [67].
- The classical tests of Kolmogorov-Smirnov (one-sided) and Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney
  reach α values of significance, which are respectively of 1.40% and 2.62%.
- A possible explanation for this finding is the production of specific compound(s)
  in the GM feed that are either directly toxic and/or cause the inhibition of pathways,
  which in turn generates toxic effects.
- This is despite the fact that the variety of GM maize used in this study was judged
  by industry and regulators as being substantially equivalent to the corresponding
  non-GM closest isogenic line [3,30].
- As the total chemical composition of the GM maize has not been measured in detail,
  the use of substantial equivalence as a concept in risk assessment is insufficient
  to highlight potential unknown toxins and therefore cannot replace long-term animal
  feeding trials for GMOs.
- A cause of the ill effects resulting from NK603 GM maize alone observed in this
  study could be the fact that it is engineered to overexpress a modified version
  of the _Agrobacterium tumefaciens_ 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS-CP4)
  [3], which confers R tolerance.
- The modified EPSPS is not inhibited by G, in contrast to the wild-type enzyme in
  the crop.
- This enzyme is known to drive the first step of aromatic amino acid biosynthesis
  in the plant shikimate pathway.
- In addition, estrogenic isoflavones and their glycosides are also products of this
  pathway [68].
- A limited compositional analysis showed that these biochemical pathways were not
  disturbed in the GM maize used in our study.
- However, our analysis did reveal that the levels of caffeic and ferulic acids in
  the GM diet, which are also secondary metabolites of the plant shikimate pathway,
  but not always measured in regulatory tests, were significantly reduced.
- This may lower their protective effects against carcinogenesis and mammalian tumor
  formation [69,70].
- Moreover, these phenolic acids, and in particular ferulic acid, may modulate estrogen
  receptors or the estrogenic pathway in mammalian cells [71].
- This does not exclude the possibility of the action of other unknown metabolites.
- This explanation also corresponds to the fact that the observed effects of NK603
  GM maize and R were not additive but reached a threshold.
- This implies that both the NK603 maize and R may cause hormonal disturbances in
  the same biochemical and physiological pathways.
- In conclusion, the consumption of NK603 GM maize with or without R application or
  R alone gave similar pathologies in male and female rats fed over a 2-year period.
- It was previously known that G consumption in water above authorized limits may
  provoke hepatic and kidney failure [33].
- The results of the study presented here clearly indicate that lower levels of complete
  agricultural G herbicide formulations, at concentrations well below officially set
  safety limits, can induce severe hormone-dependent mammary, hepatic, and kidney
  disturbances.
- Similarly, disruption of biosynthetic pathways that may result from overexpression
  of the EPSPS transgene in the GM NK603 maize can give rise to comparable pathologies
  that may be linked to abnormal or unbalanced phenolic acid metabolites or related
  compounds.
- Other mutagenic and metabolic effects of the edible GMO cannot be excluded.
- This will be the subject of future studies, including analyses of transgene, G and
  other R residue presence in rat tissues.
- Reproductive and multigenerational studies will also provide novel insight into
  these problems.
- This study represents the first detailed documentation of long-term deleterious
  effects arising from consumption of a GMO, specifically a R-tolerant maize, and
  of R, the most widely used herbicide worldwide.
- Taken together, the significant biochemical disturbances and physiological failures
  documented in this work reveal the pathological effects of these GMO and R treatments
  in both sexes, with different amplitudes.
- They also show that the conclusion of the Monsanto authors [3] that the initial
  indications of organ toxicity found in their 90-day experiment were not ‘biologically
  meaningful’ is not justifiable.
- We propose that agricultural edible GMOs and complete pesticide formulations must
  be evaluated thoroughly in long-term studies to measure their potential toxic effects.
- The experimental protocol was conducted in an animal care unit authorized by the
  French Ministries of Agriculture and Research (Agreement Number A35-288-1).
- Animal experiments were performed according to ethical guidelines of animal experimentations
  (CEE 86/609 regulation), including the necessary observations of all tumors, in
  line with the requirements for a long-term toxicological study [32], up to a size
  where euthanasia on ethical grounds was necessary.
- Concerning the cultivation of the maize used in this study, no specific permits
  were required.
- This is because the maize was grown (MON-00603-6 commonly named NK603) in Canada,
  where it is authorized for unconfined release into the environment and for use as
  a livestock feed by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (Decision Document 2002-35).
- We confirm that the cultivation did not involve endangered or protected species.
- The GM maize was authorized for import and consumption into the European Union (CE
  258/97 regulation).
- The varieties of maize used in this study were the DKC 2678 R-tolerant NK603 (Monsanto
  Corp., USA), and its nearest isogenic non-transgenic control DKC 2675.
- These two types of maize were grown under similar normal conditions, in the same
  location, spaced at sufficient distance to avoid cross-contamination.
- The genetic nature, as well as the purity of the GM seeds and harvested material,
  was confirmed by qPCR analysis of DNA samples.
- One field of NK603 was treated with R at 3 L ha−1 (WeatherMAX, 540 g/L of G, EPA
  Reg.
- 524-537), and another field of NK603 was not treated with R. Corn cobs were harvested
  when the moisture content was less than 30% and were dried at a temperature below
  30°C.
- From these three cultivations of maize, laboratory rat chow was made based on the
  standard diet A04 (Safe, France).
- The dry rat feed was made to contain 11%, 22%, or 33% of GM maize, cultivated either
  with or without R, or 33% of the non-transgenic control line.
- The concentrations of the transgene were confirmed in the three doses of each diet
  by qPCR.
- All feed formulations consisted of balanced diets, chemically measured as substantially
  equivalent except for the transgene, with no contaminating pesticides over standard
  limits.
- All secondary metabolites cannot be known and measured in the composition.
- However, we measured isoflavones and phenolic acids including ferulic acid by standard
  HPLC-UV.
- All reagents used were of analytical grade.
- The herbicide diluted in the drinking water was the commercial formulation of R
  (GT Plus, 450 g/L of G, approval 2020448, Monsanto, Belgium).
- Herbicide levels were assessed by G measurements in the different dilutions by mass
  spectrometry.
- Virgin albino Sprague-Dawley rats at 5 weeks of age were obtained from Harlan (Gannat,
  France).
- All animals were kept in polycarbonate cages (820 cm2, Genestil, France) with two
  animals of the same sex per cage.
- The litter (Toplit classic, Safe, France) was replaced twice weekly.
- The animals were maintained at 22 ± 3°C under controlled humidity (45% to 65%) and
  air purity with a 12 h-light/dark cycle, with free access to food and water.
- The location of each cage within the experimental room was regularly changed.
- This 2-year life-long experiment was conducted in a Good Laboratory Practice (GLP)
  accredited laboratory according to OECD guidelines.
- After 20 days of acclimatization, 100 male and 100 female animals were randomly
  assigned on a weight basis into ten equivalent groups.
- For each sex, one control group had access to plain water and standard diet from
  the closest isogenic non-transgenic maize control; six groups were fed with 11%,
  22%, and 33% of GM NK603 maize either treated or not treated with R. The final three
  groups were fed with the control diet and had access to water supplemented with
  respectively 1.1 × 10−8% of R (0.1 ppb or 50 ng/L of G, the contaminating level
  of some regular tap waters), 0.09% of R (400 mg/kg G, US MRL of 400 ppm G in some
  GM feed), and 0.5% of R (2.25 g/L G, half of the minimal agricultural working dilution).
- This was changed weekly.
- Twice-weekly monitoring allowed careful observation and palpation of animals, recording
  of clinical signs, measurement of any tumors, food and water consumption, and individual
  body weights.
- Animals were sacrificed during the course of the study only if necessary because
  of suffering according to ethical rules (such as 25% body weight loss, tumors over
  25% body weight, hemorrhagic bleeding, or prostration) and at the end of the study
  by exsanguination under isoflurane anesthesia.
- 'In each case, detailed observations and anatomopathology was performed and the
  following organs were collected: brain, colon, heart, kidneys, liver, lungs, ovaries,
  spleen, testes, adrenals, epididymis, prostate, thymus, uterus, aorta, bladder,
  bone, duodenum, esophagus, eyes, ileum, jejunum, lymph nodes, lymphoreticular system,
  mammary glands, pancreas, parathyroid glands, Peyer''s patches, pituitary, salivary
  glands, sciatic nerve, skin, spinal cord, stomach, thyroid, and trachea.'
- The first 14 organs (at least ten per animal depending on the sex, Table 1) were
  weighted, plus any tumors that arose.
- The first nine were divided into two parts and one half was immediately frozen in
  liquid nitrogen/carbonic ice.
- The remaining parts including other organs were rinsed in PBS and stored in 4% formalin
  before anatomopathological study.
- These samples were used for further paraffin-embedding, slides, and HES histological
  staining.
- For transmission electron microscopy, the kidneys, livers, and tumors were cut into
  1 mm3 fragments.
- Samples were fixed in pre-chilled 2% paraformaldehyde/2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1
  M PBS pH 7.4 at 4°C for 3 h and processed as previously described [13].
- 'Blood samples were collected from the tail vein of each rat under short isoflurane
  anesthesia before treatment and after 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, and 24 months:
  11 measurements were obtained for each animal alive at 2 years.'
- It was first demonstrated that anesthesia did not impact animal health.
- Two aliquots of plasma and serum were prepared and stored at −80°C.
- Then, 31 parameters were assessed (Table 1) according to standard methods including
  hematology and coagulation parameters, albumin, globulin, total protein concentration,
  creatinine, urea, calcium, sodium, potassium, chloride, inorganic phosphorus, triglycerides,
  glucose, total cholesterol, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase,
  gamma glutamyl-transferase (GT), estradiol, and testosterone.
- In addition, at months 12 and 24, the C-reactive protein was assayed.
- Urine samples were collected similarly 11 times, over 24 h in individual metabolic
  cages, and 16 parameters were quantified including creatinine, phosphorus, potassium,
  chloride, sodium, calcium, pH, and clearance.
- Liver samples taken at the end made it possible to perform assays of CYP1A1, 1A2,
  3A4, 2C9 activities in S9 fractions, with glutathione S-transferase and gamma-GT.
- In this study, multivariate analyses were more appropriate than pairwise comparisons
  between groups because the parameters were very numerous, with samples of ten individuals.
- Kaplan-Meyer comparisons, for instance, were not used because these are better adapted
  to epidemiological studies.
- Differences in the numbers of mammary tumors were studied by a non-parametric multiple
  comparisons Kruskal-Wallis test, followed by a _post hoc_ Dunn's test with the GraphPad
  Prism 5 software.
- Biochemical data were treated by multivariate analysis with the SIMCA-P (V12) software
  (UMETRICS AB Umea, Sweden).
- The use of chemometrics tools, for example, principal component analysis (PCA),
  partial least squares to latent structures (PLS), and orthogonal PLS (OPLS), are
  robust methods for modeling, analyzing, and interpreting complex chemical and biological
  data.
- OPLS is a recent modification of the PLS method.
- PLS is a regression method used in order to find the relationship between two data
  tables referred to as _X_ and _Y_.
- PLS regression [72] analysis consists in calculating by means of successive iterations,
  linear combinations of the measured _X_-variables (predictor variables).
- These linear combinations of _X_-variables give PLS components (score vectors _t_).
- A PLS component can be thought of as a new variable - a latent variable - reflecting
  the information in the original _X_-variables that is of relevance for modeling
  and predicting the response _Y_-variable by means of the maximization of the square
  of covariance (Max cov2(_X_,_Y_)).
- The number of components is determined by cross validation.
- SIMCA software uses the nonlinear iterative partial least squares algorithm (NIPALS)
  for the PLS regression.
- Orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) was used in this
  study [73,74].
- The purpose of discriminant analysis is to find a model that separates groups of
  observations on the basis of their _X_ variables.
- The _X_ matrix consists of the biochemical data.
- The _Y_ matrix contains dummy variables which describe the group membership of each
  observation.
- Binary variables are used in order to encode a group identity.
- Discriminant analysis finds a discriminant plan in which the projected observations
  are well separated according to each group.
- The objective of OPLS is to divide the systematic variation in the _X_-block into
  two model parts, one linearly related to _Y_ (in the case of a discriminant analysis,
  the group membership), and the other one unrelated (orthogonal) to _Y_.
- Components related to _Y_ are called predictive, and those unrelated to _Y_ are
  called orthogonal.
- This partitioning of the _X_ data results in improved model transparency and interpretability
  [75].
- Prior to analysis, variables were mean-centered and unit variance scaled.

  with regulatory assessments for GMOs and pesticides, they are independent from companies
  developing these products.
