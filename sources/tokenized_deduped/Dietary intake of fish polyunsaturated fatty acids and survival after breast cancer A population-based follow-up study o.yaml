- In laboratory experiments, ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have been found
  to reduce inflammatory eicosanoids resulting from ω-6 PUFA metabolism via competitive
  inhibition, and the ω-3-induced cytotoxic environment increases apoptosis and reduces
  cell growth in breast cancer cells.
- To the authors' knowledge, epidemiologic investigations regarding whether dietary
  ω-3 PUFA intake benefits survival after breast cancer are limited and inconsistent.
- The authors used resources from a population-based follow-up study conducted on
  Long Island, New York, among 1463 women newly diagnosed with first primary breast
  cancer who were interviewed an average of approximately 3 months after diagnosis
  to assess risk and prognostic factors, including dietary intake (using a food frequency
  questionnaire).
- Vital status was determined through 2011, yielding a median follow-up of 14.7 years
  and 485 deaths.
- Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were estimated
  using Cox proportional hazards regression.
- All-cause mortality was reduced among women with breast cancer reporting the highest
  quartile of intake (compared with never) for tuna (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.55-0.92),
  other baked/broiled fish (HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.58-0.97), and the dietary long-chain
  ω-3 PUFAs docosahexaenoic acid (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.55-0.92) and eicosapentaenoic
  acid (HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.58-0.97).
- All-cause mortality was reduced by 16% to 34% among women with breast cancer who
  reported a high intake of fish and long-chain ω-3 PUFAs.
- Long-chain ω-3 PUFA intake from fish and other dietary sources may provide a potential
  strategy to improve survival after breast cancer.

- Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death among women in the United
  States, with approximately 40,000 estimated new deaths in 2013.
- '[1] Clinical and demographic indicators of breast cancer prognosis include large
  tumor size, lymph node involvement, hormone receptor-negative subtype, early age
  at diagnosis, and low socioeconomic status.'
- '[2] Weight maintenance and physical activity may improve survival after breast
  cancer,[3, 4] but because it is a multifactorial disease, it is plausible that additional
  strategies, including intake of specific nutritional factors, would also improve
  survival among women diagnosed with the disease.'
- One potential nutritional risk reduction strategy is polyunsaturated fatty acids
  (PUFAs), of which ω-3 and ω-6 are the 2 primary classes.
- Inflammatory eicosanoids of arachidonic acid (AA), an ω-6 PUFA, have been shown
  in laboratory studies to increase cell proliferation, metastatic potential, aromatase
  activity, and angiogenesis; and reduce apoptosis and cellular differentiation.
- '[5] ω-3 Fatty acids bind to the same enzymes used in AA metabolism and therefore
  potentially lower the levels of inflammatory eicosanoids generated by ω-6 metabolism.'
- '[5] In addition, the cytotoxic environment induced by ω-3 PUFAs has been reported
  to increase apoptosis and reduce cell growth in transformed and malignant breast
  cancer cells.'
- '[5, 6] Long-chain ω-3 PUFAs have demonstrated an ability to chemosensitize breast
  cancer tumors and thus potentially improve treatment efficacy.'
- '[7] Therefore, it is plausible that intake of ω-3 PUFAs, for which fish is the
  major dietary source, could provide an opportunity to improve survival among women
  with breast cancer.'
- Despite this laboratory evidence, to the best of our knowledge few epidemiologic
  studies to date have examined the association between dietary PUFA intake and survival
  after breast cancer.
- '[8-10] Two studies[8, 9] used cross-sectional study designs, thereby limiting inferences
  regarding the potential association between PUFA intake and breast cancer survival.'
- Another study examined the relation between adipose tissue biomarkers of PUFA on
  survival after breast cancer[10] and reported no associations; however, the interpretation
  of the results was limited due to the small number of deaths.
- Thus, the epidemiologic evidence of a potential association between dietary PUFA
  intake and survival among women with breast cancer is limited.
- Previous studies examining fish intake and mortality among breast cancer survivors
  are inconsistent.
- '[11, 12] One Japanese investigation followed cases for 9 to 12 years and reported
  increased breast cancer mortality with high fish consumption[12]; however, the study
  population was based on a small number of deaths.'
- The second study used participants from the Women's Healthy Eating and Living (WHEL)
  study, a low-fat dietary intervention that manipulated total fat intake, and found
  that higher intake of ω-3 fatty acids (eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA] and docosahexaenoic
  acid [DHA]) from fish was associated with reduced breast cancer recurrence and all-cause
  mortality.
- '[11] However, this United States-based study did not assess short-chain ω-3 PUFAs
  (eg, alpha-linolenic acid [ALA]), which are readily obtained in the diet of Western
  populations.'
- For the current study, we examined whether a higher intake of fish, as well as any
  other dietary sources of ω-3 PUFAs, was associated with improved survival among
  women diagnosed with breast cancer on Long Island, New York.
- We also considered associations with ω-6 PUFAs and the balance between ω-3 and ω-6
  intake.
- To the best of our knowledge, the current study is the first to consider multiple
  PUFA interactions with genes in relation to survival.
- This follow-up study used resources from the Long Island Breast Cancer Study Project
  (LIBCSP), a population-based study.
- '[3, 4, 13] Institutional Review Board approval was obtained from all participating
  institutions.'
- Women eligible for the LIBCSP follow-up study were English-speaking residents of
  Long Island, New York (Nassau and Suffolk counties) who were newly diagnosed with
  a first primary in situ (16%) or invasive (84%) breast cancer between August 1,
  1996 and July 31, 1997.
- After obtaining physician approval, study personnel contacted pathology departments
  from participating hospitals (2-3 times per week or daily for those hospitals with
  large numbers of newly diagnosed cases) to identify potentially eligible subjects.
- The final LIBCSP follow-up sample consisted of 1508 women with breast cancer.
- Within approximately 3 months of diagnosis, 98% of the patients (1479 patients)
  completed a validated, self-administered, 101-item modified Block food frequency
  questionnaire (FFQ).
- '[14-16] Subjects with implausible total energy intake (±3 standard deviations [SDs]
  from the mean) were excluded (16 women).'
- Thus, the final analytic cohort for this ancillary study included 1463 women with
  newly diagnosed breast cancer.
- At the time of diagnosis (baseline) with the first primary breast cancer, participants
  ranged in age from 20 to 98 years and 67% were postmenopausal; 94% of the participants
  reported their race as white, 4% as black, and 2% as other, which reflects the underlying
  racial distribution of Nassau and Suffolk counties at the time of data collection.
- '[3, 4, 13]




  Vital status through December 31, 2011 for all LIBCSP participants was determined
  via linkage with the National Death Index, a standard epidemiologic resource for
  ascertaining mortality data in the United States.'
- '[17] We identified women who died from all causes (death from any cause) and those
  whose deaths were related to breast cancer (breast cancer-specific mortality).'
- Breast cancer-related deaths were determined using the _International Classification
  of Diseases_ (codes 174.9 or C-50.9).
- Among the 1463 participants included in the current study, the median follow-up
  time was 14.7 years after breast cancer diagnosis (range, 0.2-15.4 years), and we
  identified 485 total deaths, 210 of which were breast cancer-specific.
- LIBCSP participants self-completed the FFQ and were administered a baseline, structured
  questionnaire by a trained interviewer within an average of 3 months after diagnosis.
- The FFQ assessed dietary intake within the year before the interview.
- Other factors assessed included demographic characteristics; reproductive and menstrual
  history; exogenous hormone use, family history of breast cancer, and other medical
  history; body size, physical activity, and alcohol use; active and passive cigarette
  smoking; and occupational history and other environmental exposures.
- '[13] Medical records were abstracted to determine tumor characteristics of the
  first primary breast cancer and the first course of treatment for the first primary
  breast cancer.'
- Concordance between the medical record and the self-reported treatment data was
  high (kappa &gt;90%) and thus the self-reported data were used in the current study.
- PUFA intake from any dietary source was estimated by linking participant responses
  from the FFQ (ie, g/day for each line item) with average nutrient values for foods
  included in each line item available in the United States Department of Agriculture
  databases for ω-3 and ω-6 PUFAs.
- '[18] The following PUFA subtypes were estimated: 1) ω-3 PUFAs, including ALA, docosapentaenoic
  acid (DPA), DHA, and EPA; and 2) ω-6 PUFAs, including linoleic acid (LA) and AA.'
- An estimated total ω-3 and ω-6 PUFA intake (hereafter referred to as total PUFA
  intake) was calculated by combining all individual PUFA subtypes.
- In addition, an estimate of total ω-3 and ω-6 PUFA intake was obtained by summing
  each individual fatty acid within each category (eg, total ω-3 PUFA intake was ALA
  plus DPA plus DHA plus EPA), representing total ω-3 and ω-6 intakes that are commonly
  consumed among United States populations.
- 'Fish and/or seafood consumption were also assessed by the FFQ as: 1) tuna, tuna
  salad, and tuna casserole; 2) shellfish (shrimp, lobster, crab, oysters, etc); and
  3) other fish (broiled/baked).'
- Kaplan-Meier survival curves were constructed and Cox proportional hazards regression
  models[19] were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals
  (95% CIs) to assess the associations between intake of fish as well as PUFAs from
  any dietary source, and all-cause and breast cancer-specific mortality for the full
  15-years of follow-up.
- As a sensitivity analysis, we also estimated HRs for 5 years of follow-up.
- For regression analyses, the proportional hazards assumption was assessed using
  exposure interactions with time, as well as Martingale residuals.
- '[19] No violations were observed.'
- Quartiles were created for each PUFA exposure (total PUFA, total ω-3, ALA, DPA,
  DHA, EPA, total ω-6, LA, AA, and ratio of ω-3 to ω-6) based on the distributions
  among the 1463 women with breast cancer included in the current study.
- Although other exposure cutpoints were considered (eg, tertiles, quintiles, linear,
  and splines), the shape of the dose response between PUFAs and the log-hazard of
  mortality was best captured with quartiles, balancing both parsimony and nonlinearity
  of the exposure.
- Similarly, quartiles were created for exposures related to fish intake (ie, tuna,
  shellfish, and other fish).
- We conducted linear trend tests by modeling the exposure continuously.
- '[20]


  In the Cox proportional hazards models, we also considered interactions between
  total ω-3 and total ω-6 intakes, and between the ω-3/ω-6 ratio in association with
  mortality.'
- For these interaction analyses, PUFAs were dichotomized at the median.
- Interaction was evaluated on the additive scale and measured using relative excess
  risk due to interaction, with corresponding 95% CIs calculated using the Hosmer
  and Lemeshow method.
- '[21] Multiplicative interactions were also assessed using the likelihood ratio
  test; however, the conclusions did not change (data not shown).'
- Effect modification of the association between PUFA intake and mortality by menopausal
  status (postmenopausal vs premenopausal), hormone receptor status (hormone receptor-positive
  breast cancer vs hormone receptor-negative disease), dietary supplement use (yes/no),
  treatment (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or hormone therapy), and body mass index
  (BMI) (&lt;25 kg/m2 vs ≥25 kg/m2) were also examined in the PUFA regression models.
- However, after stratification, little or no heterogeneity was observed for all but
  BMI (see online Supporting Information).
- In addition, we estimated the direct association between PUFA intake and survival
  while accounting for the potential influence of prediagnostic PUFA intake on tumor
  size using inverse probability weighting (see online Supporting Information).
- '[22]


  Potential confounders for the association between PUFA intake and mortality were
  identified using a directed acyclic graph[20] and included age (5-year age group),
  total energy intake (kcal/day), nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, family history
  of breast cancer, income, BMI, alcohol use, fruit and vegetable intake, physical
  activity, and race.'
- No adjustment was made for potential intermediates of the hypothesized association
  between PUFA intake and mortality.
- However, only age and total energy intake were found to change the HR estimates
  by &gt;10%, and thus all PUFA mortality regression models were adjusted for these
  2 confounders.
- 'We conducted sensitivity analyses to determine whether results varied when restricting
  the cohort to: 1) women with invasive tumors and 2) white individuals.'
- However, the restricted sensitivity results did not vary substantially from those
  based on all women, and therefore only the latter are shown.
- To the best of our knowledge, the current study is the first to explore interactions
  between PUFA intake and putatively functional genetic polymorphisms involved in
  multiple biologically relevant pathways.
- Laboratory and statistical methods for these exploratory analyses are described
  in the online Supporting Information.
- All statistical analyses were conducted using PROC PHREG (Cox proportional hazards
  regression models) and PROC LIFETEST (Kaplan-Meier survival curves) in SAS statistical
  software (version 9.2; SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC).
- As shown in Table 1, among our population-based sample of women with breast cancer
  (1463 women), a baseline intake of total ω-3 fatty acids from any dietary source
  (average total ω-3 intake, 0.99 g/day [SD, 0.69]) was lower compared with ω-6 fatty
  acid intake (average total ω-6 intake, 7.51 g/day [SD, 5.26]).
- ALA intake was found to be the highest contributor to total ω-3 intake, with an
  average intake of 0.85 g/day (SD, 0.67), whereas LA was the highest contributor
  to total ω-6 intake, with an average intake of 7.44 g/day (SD, 5.24).
- Tuna intake was higher (8.13 g/day [SD, 10.61]) compared with shellfish intake (3.30
  g/day [SD, 6.01]).
- As also shown in Table 1, fish was a primary contributor to the high intake of long-chain
  ω-3 PUFAs, including DPA, DHA, and EPA.
- In contrast, foods that contributed to high ALA intake were biscuits/muffins and
  other fried foods.
- In addition, a high AA intake appeared to be driven by eggs and meats, including
  fish, chicken, and ham.
- The Kaplan-Meier curves shown in Figure 1 indicate survival was improved among the
  population-based sample of women with breast cancer reporting a higher intake (quartiles
  3 and 4) of the long-chain ω-3 fatty acids DPA, DHA, and EPA.
- As presented in Table 2, reductions of 16% to 34% in all-cause mortality were observed
  for a higher intake of long-chain ω-3 fatty acids.
- Specifically, lower death rates were observed for the highest 2 quartiles of intake
  (quartile 3 or 4) compared with the lowest quartile (quartile 1) of DHA (HRQ3vs.Q1,
  0.73 [95% CI, 0.56-0.94] and HRQ4vs.Q1, 0.71 [95% CI, 0.55-0.92]), EPA (HRQ3vs.Q1,
  0.70 [95% CI, 0.54-0.91] and HRQ4vs.Q1, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.58-0.97]), and DPA (HRQ3vs.Q1,
  0.66 [95% CI, 0.51-0.86] and HRQ4vs.Q1, 0.84 [95% CI, 0.64-1.10]).
- The corresponding HR for the ω-3/ω-6 ratio was modestly decreased by 15%, but the
  95% CI included the null value.
- As also shown in Table 2, adjusted HRs for all-cause mortality were increased by
  14% to 30% for higher intakes of total ω-6, LA, AA, and ALA but 95% CIs were wide.
- Patterns were similar, but less precise, for PUFA intake from all dietary sources
  in relation to breast cancer-specific mortality after 15 years of follow-up (Table
  3), and when we considered all-cause mortality after 5-years of follow-up (see Supporting
  Information Table S1).
- Figure 1\.

  sample of women with breast cancer in the Long Island Breast Cancer Study Project,
  1996/1997 through 2011 (with an average follow-up of 14.7 years).
- Dotted line indicates quartile 1; dashed line, quartile 2; thin line, quartile 3;
  thick line, quartile 4.
- We also considered an interaction between ω-3 and ω-6 and all-cause mortality; however,
  as shown in Supporting Information Table S2, no interaction on an additive scale
  was observed.
- Although there was statistical evidence of an interaction on a multiplicative scale
  when considering the association between PUFA and all-cause mortality stratified
  by BMI (Supporting Information Tables S3 and S4), there was no consistent pattern
  observed.
- In addition, the inverse probability estimates for the direct association of PUFA
  and survival accounting for tumor size (see Supporting Information Table S5) were
  similar to the estimates that did not account for tumor size.
- Despite our novel biologic hypothesis, we observed little or no association between
  select putatively functional genetic polymorphisms involved in inflammation, oxidative
  stress, and estrogen metabolism and all-cause mortality (see Supporting Information
  Table S6), nor did we observe notable interactions between the ω-3/ω-6 ratio and
  polymorphisms in multiple biologic pathways on overall mortality (see Supporting
  Information Table S7).
- As shown in Table 4, fish intake was associated with a 25% to 34% reduction in all-cause
  mortality.
- Specifically, lower rates of death were observed for those in the highest quartile
  of tuna intake compared with no intake (HRQ4, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.55-0.92) and the highest
  2 quartiles for other fish (broiled/baked) (HRQ3, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.51-0.85] and HRQ4,
  0.75 [95% CI, 0.58-0.97]).
- There was little or no evidence of an association between all-cause mortality and
  shellfish intake.
- Adjusted estimates for breast cancer-specific mortality demonstrated pronounced
  but imprecise reductions when we considered tuna and other fish in relation to 5
  years of follow-up (see Supporting Information Table S1).
- 'However, estimates were closer to the null when we considered 15 years of follow-up
  (tuna: HRQ4, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.54-1.21) and other baked/broiled fish (HRQ4, 1.04;
  95% CI, 0.71-1.52).'
- In this population-based follow-up study of women with breast cancer, we observed
  reduced hazards of 16% to 34% for all-cause mortality after 15 years of follow-up
  with consumption of higher levels compared with the lowest level of long-chain ω-3
  fatty acids (DPA, DHA, and EPA).
- Similarly, a higher intake of tuna and other baked/broiled fish was associated with
  a 25% to 34% decrease in all-cause mortality (and an imprecise 19% reduction in
  breast cancer-specific mortality in association with tuna intake only).
- As shown in the Supporting Information, we found limited evidence of an interaction
  between ω-3 and ω-6, or between PUFAs and most genotypes considered in 3 related
  pathways.
- The results of the current population-based study are consistent with those of a
  previous study regarding PUFA and/or fish intake in relation to survival among women
  with breast cancer that is relatively comparable to our own.
- '[11] Patterson et al[11] examined marine food sources of EPA and DHA in the WHEL
  study, and reported reductions of 28% for disease recurrence and 41% for all-cause
  mortality.'
- The methods for the WHEL study differ from ours in that only marine ω-3 sources
  were assessed using repeated 24-hour recalls after varying lengths of time since
  diagnosis among women recruited for a dietary intervention aimed at reducing breast
  cancer recurrence.
- Whereas we considered marine and other dietary PUFA sources that were assessed using
  a 101-item FFQ administered within 3 months of diagnosis to a population-based sample
  of women who were newly diagnosed with breast cancer.
- The robustness of the results across studies, despite the methodological differences
  between the LIBCSP study and the WHEL study, support the possibility of long-chain
  ω-3 PUFAs as a potential risk reduction strategy for breast cancer survivors, even
  in the presence of potential measurement error.
- Further research is needed to confirm these findings.
- The results reported herein for long-chain ω-3 fatty acids (DPA, DHA, and EPA),
  total ω-6, LA, AA, and the ratio of ω-3/ω-6 are consistent with the biologic mechanism
  of a PUFA-induced cytotoxic environment via lipid peroxidation, and the potential
  benefit of this environment on reducing apoptosis and cell growth in cancer cells.
- '[5, 6] Long-chain ω-3 fatty acids contain more double bonds within the fatty acid
  chain compared with ALA and ω-6 fatty acids.'
- These double bonds provide additional opportunities for lipid peroxidation and thus
  could help to promote a cytotoxic environment within the cell.
- Consequently, this cytotoxic environment could provide a beneficial environment
  for women with breast cancer.
- The results of the current study for ALA intake, which suggest a modest increase
  in the rate of overall death, are not consistent with a biologic hypothesis via
  inflammatory pathways.
- This discrepancy may reflect the foods that are contributing to high ALA intake
  in our Long Island population; namely, we observed that the foods containing butter
  and fried foods are contributing to high ALA intake.
- The similarity in foods contributing to high intake for ALA and ω-6 fatty acid intake
  may explain the potentially spurious increased rate of overall death observed for
  a greater intake of ALA.
- In addition, in vivo conversion of ALA into long-chain ω-3 PUFAs is inefficient
  in populations with high ω-6 intake,[23] which may possibly explain the modest increase
  in the overall rate of death observed in the current study.
- This prospective, population-based study has multiple strengths.
- To the best of our knowledge, the current study is the first to examine the potential
  relation between PUFA intake and breast cancer survival, while simultaneously considering
  both ω-3 and ω-6 PUFAs.
- In addition, we examined multiple ω-3 (eg, ALA, DPA, DHA, and EPA) and ω-6 (eg,
  LA and AA) subtypes in relation to all-cause mortality, and therefore our additional
  assessments complement and move beyond what was examined in WHEL, a low-fat dietary
  intervention for which examination of ω-6 PUFAs was not reported.
- Consideration of nonmarine sources of PUFAs may be critical for some United States
  populations that consume low amounts of fish.
- '[24] Furthermore, to our knowledge the current study is the first to explore PUFA
  interactions with genes in multiple genetic pathways using a population-based design
  (discussed in more detail in the Supporting Information).'
- However, our follow-up study also has limitations.
- Despite the relatively large sample size, estimates for the associations with breast
  cancer-specific mortality were imprecise for both the 5-year and 15-year follow-up
  periods, and were less pronounced compared with all-cause mortality for the entire
  15-year follow-up period only.
- It is possible that long-chain ω-3 intake has the potential to reduce 15-year mortality
  from other outcomes, such as cardiovascular disease mortality, which could potentially
  lead to more pronounced estimates for all-cause compared with breast-cancer specific
  mortality after 15 years of follow-up.
- Nonetheless, during the first 5 years after a breast cancer diagnosis, the majority
  of deaths are due to breast cancer.
- Thus, the results of the current study suggest that ω-3 PUFA intake is associated
  with both all-cause and breast cancer-specific mortality within the first 5 years
  after diagnosis.
- In addition, we were able to capture dietary intake close to the time of diagnosis,
  and thus this exposure window may be more relevant for the 5-year follow period
  given the more pronounced estimates observed for this time period.
- However, the imprecision for all breast cancer-specific estimates, regardless of
  the time period, is likely due to PUFA measurement error.
- For example, it is possible that a one-time baseline FFQ measurement of diet may
  not accurately reflect dietary intake throughout the 15-year period after diagnosis.
- One recent study compared prediagnosis versus postdiagnosis dietary intake, and
  reported dietary increases in oily fish and fish oil consumption after breast cancer
  diagnosis.
- '[25] However, this repeated measure study enrolled women 9 months to 15 months
  after diagnosis, and asked them to concurrently recall dietary intake 1 year before
  diagnosis as well as changes in diet after diagnosis; therefore, the reported changes
  in dietary intake are subject to errors in recall.'
- Nonetheless, it is possible that the estimates of long-chain ω-3 PUFA intake in
  the current study population are conservative.
- Furthermore, long-chain ω-3 PUFA levels differ by fish species, with tuna being
  among the highest.
- '[26] Thus, future, larger studies should consider repeated PUFA measurements (self-reported
  intake of specific fish species, fish oil, and/or biomarkers) throughout follow-up
  to enhance our examination of the potential association between long-chain ω-3 PUFAs
  and survival in patients with breast cancer.'
- In addition, although the current study is population-based and reflects the racial
  distribution of the target population on Long Island, which improves study validity,
  the LIBCSP population includes predominantly white women and therefore examination
  of racial differences was not possible.
- However, the current study results are generalizable to white women, for whom the
  rates of breast cancer remain high.
- '[1] Future studies may consider exploring possible heterogeneity between PUFA and
  survival by race, or by breast cancer tumor subtypes.'
- In the current population-based follow-up study of women with breast cancer on Long
  Island, New York, we observed reductions of 16% to 34% in all-cause mortality after
  15 years of follow-up for a high intake of fish and long-chain ω-3 PUFAs (DPA, DHA,
  and EPA), which is consistent with laboratory evidence and what to the best of our
  knowledge is the one other United States-based epidemiologic study considering this
  issue.
- '[11] Thus, pending additional replication, dietary intake of fish and other sources
  of long-chain ω-3 fatty acids may provide an additional strategy with which to improve
  survival after breast cancer.'
