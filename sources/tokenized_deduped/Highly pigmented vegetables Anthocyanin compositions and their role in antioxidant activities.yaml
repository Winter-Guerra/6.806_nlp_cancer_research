- Twelve highly pigmented (red or purple) vegetables (carrots, cabbage, cauliflower,
  potatoes, onions, asparagus and eggplant) were investigated for their total anthocyanin
  contents (TAC) and compositions of the individual anthocyanins and anthocyanidins
  by UPLC and LC-DAD-ESI-MS, and their antioxidant activities by DPPH, FRAP (ferric
  reducing antioxidant power) and ORAC (oxygen radical absorption capacity) assays.
- While a total of 26 anthocyanins were identified, the main aglycones were only found
  to be limited to 4 anthocyanidins (cyanidin, petunidin, pelargonidin and delphinidin).
- The TAC ranged from 0.08 to 2.01 mg Cyanidin-3-glucoside (C3G)/g DW and the total
  phenolic contents (TPC) was from 1.30 to 2.19 mg GAE/g DW suggesting that anthocyanins
  were the main phenolics in certain vegetables but not others.
- DPPH radical scavenging activities were 54.91-81.94%, FRAP values 10.00-70.07 Î¼mol
  AAE/g DW and ORAC values were 3.74-189.32 Î¼mol TE/g DW.
- The two cruciferous vegetables (purple cauliflower and cabbage) showed the highest
  TPC, TAC, DPPH and FRAP values, and the onions the lowest.
- The antioxidant activities in the DPPH and FRAP assays correlated well with the
  TPC and TAC, but ORAC did not.
- Results of this study are comparable and provide a rapid and effective method for
  the identification and quantification of all major anthocyanidins and their glycosides
  (anthocyanins), and how they might contribute to the antioxidant activity, therefore
  important information in developing anthocyanin-rich nutraceuticals and functional
  foods.
