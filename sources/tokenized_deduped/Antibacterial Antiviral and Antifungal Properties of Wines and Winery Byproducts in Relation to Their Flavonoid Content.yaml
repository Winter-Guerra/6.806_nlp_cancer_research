- Grapes produce organic compounds that may be involved in the defense of the plants
  against invading phytopathogens.
- These metabolites include numerous phenolic compounds that are also active against
  human pathogens.
- Grapes are used to produce a variety of wines, grape juices, and raisins.
- Grape pomace, seeds, and skins, the remains of the grapes that are a byproduct of
  winemaking, also contain numerous bioactive compounds that differ from those found
  in grapes and wines.
- This overview surveys and interprets our present knowledge of the activities of
  wines and winery byproducts and some of their bioactive components against foodborne
  (_Bacillus cereus_, _Campylobacter jejuni_, _Escherichia coli_, _Listeria monocytogenes_,
  _Salmonella enterica_, _Staphylococcus aureus_, _Yersinia enterocolitica_, _Vibrio
  cholerae_, _Vibrio vulnificus_), medical (_Helicobacter pylori_, _Klebsiella pneumoniae_),
  and oral pathogenic bacteria, viruses (adeno, cytomegalo, hepatitis, noro, rota),
  fungi (_Candida albicans_, _Botrytis cinerea_), parasites (_Eimeria tenella_, _Trichomonas
  vaginalis_), and microbial toxins (ochratoxin A, Shiga toxin) in culture, in vivo,
  and in/on food (beef, chicken, frankfurters, hot dogs, lettuce, oysters, peppers,
  pork, sausages, soup, spinach) in relation to composition and sensory properties.
- Also covered are antimicrobial wine marinades, antioxidative and immunostimulating
  aspects, and adverse effects associated with wine consumption.
- The collated information and suggested research needs might facilitate and guide
  further studies needed to optimize the use of wines and byproducts to help improve
  microbial food safety and prevent or treat animal and human infections.

  Grapes are the second largest fruit crop in the world after oranges.'
- According to the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations, &gt;67
  million tons of grapes is produced annually worldwide, with the United States contributing
  about 10% to the total.
- (1) Wines are classified into major groups, table wines with an alcohol content
  &lt;14% and dessert wines produced from grapes high in sugar and low in acid content.
- (2) During the production of wines, up to 40% of the grapes ends up as byproducts.
- (3) Winery byproducts including grape pomace, seeds, skins, stems, and leaves are
  rich sources of inexpensive antioxidative phenolic compounds.
- (4-6) Numerous studies have demonstrated that these compounds exhibit health-promoting
  effects associated with cardioprotective, neuroprotective, and other health benefits.
- (7-13) The present paper seems to be the first review on the antimicrobial properties
  of wines and winery byproducts.
- The literature indicates that the concentrations of the byproducts vary widely among
  the different grape cultivars from which they are derived.
- Because biological activities and health benefits may depend on both the total amounts
  and the specific amounts of highly bioactive phenolic compounds present in the byproducts,
  there is a need to relate the beneficial effects to the composition of the wines
  and byproducts.
- Food safety researchers, regulatory agencies, microbiologists, virologists, epidemiologists,
  nutritionists, pharmacists, physicians, and the general public have been increasingly
  concerned about the growing number of foodborne illnesses caused by some pathogens.
- Antibiotic resistance of some pathogens associated with foodborne illness caused
  by the overconsumption of medicinal antibiotics seems to exacerbate these effects.
- There has been increasing interest in developing novel plant-derived safe antimicrobial
  compounds, including those present in grapes and grape products.
- The main objective of this review is to unify and interpret widely scattered information
  on reported studies on the inhibitory effects of bioactive grape-derived polyphenolic
  compounds against pathogenic bacteria, viruses, and fungi in vitro and in/on food.
- The cited findings and suggested research outlined below may facilitate and guide
  further needed studies to optimize the use of wines and grape-derived products to
  improve microbial food safety and to protect animals and humans against infectious
  diseases.
- In general, the phenolic composition of grapes may be influenced by variety, vineyard,
  micro- and macroclimate, viticultural practice, and winemaking techniques.
- To help provide a scientific rationale for the antibiotic properties, we will first
  provide brief summaries on the composition, sensory properties, and immunostimulating,
  antioxidative, and adverse aspects of wines.
- The extraordinarily large number of structurally different wine flavonoids is illustrated
  in randomly selected recent studies.
- (14-16) Two review papers on structures of wine flavonoids by He et al.
- (17, 18) list 25 free anthocyanin glycosides, 25 anthocyanin diglycosides, and 63
  anthocyanin-derived pigments (pyranoanthocyanins), along with molecular and fragment
  ion mass spectral peaks and UV–vis absorption maxima for most of these compounds.
- Selected compositional aspects described below further demonstrate the presence
  of different classes and amounts of polyphenolic compounds in wines originally synthesized
  in grapes and numerous new ones formed during winemaking.
- 'New Zealand Pinot noir and Pinot Meunier wines contain the following polyphenol
  compounds: (a) anthocyanins—cyanidin-3-glucoside, delphinidin-3-glcoside, malvidin-3-glucoside,
  peonidin-3-glucoside, petunidin-3-glucoside, and vitisin, with total depending on
  extraction solvent and ranging from 6.01 to 17.35 malvidin equivalents/g extracts;
  (b) flavanols—catechin, epicatechin, epicatechin gallate, procyanidin A, and procyanidin
  B; (c) flavonols—quercetin and quercetin methyl-glucoside; and (d) a nonflavonoid—gallic
  acid.'
- (17) The procyanidin content of polymeric phenolic isolates from Pinot noir wine
  during fermentation varied from 27 to 54%.
- '(18, 19)


  The analysis of wines by HPLC and LC-DAD/ESI-MS revealed the presence of the following
  classes of bioactive compounds in wines: (a) phenolic acids—caffeic, gallic, protocatechuic,
  4-hydroxybenzoic, and syringic; (b) flavonoids—(+)-catechin, catechin dimer, (−)-epicatechin,
  epicatechin gallate trimer, procyanidin B1, procyanidin B2, quercetin-3-_O_-rhamnoside,
  _trans_-polydatin, and _trans_-resveratrol; and (c) total phenolic content of 327.6
  gallic acid equivalents (GAE)/g extract.'
- (20) A related study reported a TPC of 628 mg GAE/g in grape seed extracts originating
  from Turkish grapes.
- '(21, 22)


  An Australian study found that the proximity of eucalyptus trees to grapevines can
  directly influence the concentration of the aroma compound 1,8-cineole present in
  the corresponding red wines, and a fermentation study showed that the amount of
  rotundone in red wine can be influenced by grapevine leaves and stems in the ferment.'
- '(23)


  Statistical instruments based on artificial neural networks (ANN) can be used to
  predict relationships between the total phenolic, flavonoid, anthocyanin, and tannin
  levels and antioxidative activity and wine variety and authenticity.'
- '(24)


  Using wine model solutions, Sousa et al.'
- (25) demonstrated interactions between deoxyanthocyanidin (oaklins), catechin–pyrilium
  compounds formed in red wines aged in oak barrels, and copigment molecules that
  form new wine ingredients.
- Related studies reported that (a) postharvest treatment of grapes with ethylene
  before vinification affected wine composition(26) and (b) exposure of grapevine
  cv.
- Tempranillo fruit-bearing cuttings to UV-B radiation induced changes in the profiles
  of flavonoids and amino acids.
- '(27)



  About 20% of the grape remains as pomace—peel (skins), seeds, and stems—after wine
  production.'
- (28) Pomaces that are largely used as soil conditioners or as fertilizers contain
  significant quantities of phenolic compounds that are not extracted into the wines.
- A high-phenolic grape pomace residue that consists of skin and seeds after the winemaking
  fermentation process can be analyzed.
- Several chemical and biological methods have been used to determine antioxidant
  and antimicrobial properties of grape seed and skin extracts, including quantitative
  analysis of phytochemicals by HPLC and GC-MS, measuring antioxidant activities,
  determining total antioxidant capacity, and measuring antimicrobial activity using
  the agar well diffusion method.
- The described approaches could serve as a model for the in vitro evaluation of grape
  products.
- The review by Fontana et al.
- (29) on grape pomace lists 25 reported solid–liquid extraction and 28 HPLC detection
  methods for the characterization of different classes of phenolic compounds in the
  extracts.
- The authors suggest that future studies should focus on simplified extraction methods
  and nontoxic solvents that meet generally accepted as safe (GRAS) requirements.
- The distribution of _p_-coumaric, ellagic, gallic, protocatechuic, syringic, and
  vanillic acids, (−)-epicatechin, myricetin, kaemferol, and quercetin of grape pomace
  extracts (GPE) from a mixture of Chilean grapes depended on the nature of the solvent
  used for the extraction.
- '(30)


  The pomace contains the following antioxidative polyphenolic categories: phenolic
  acids, flavonoids, lignans, and stilbenes.'
- (31) The Brazilian investigators report that GPE also contains chlorogenic acid,
  _trans_-resveratrol, and rutin and that the total phenolic content (TPC) of seeds
  (213–1652 mg/of catechin equivalents (CE)/g is greater than that in the skins (66–184
  CE/g).
- Another detailed LC-MS study of 14 pomace samples originating from red wines showed
  (a) the presence of 13 anthocyanins, 12 phenolic acids, and 15 anthoxanthins and
  stilbenes; (b) the total anthocyanin content of peel separated from five grape pomaces
  from two vintages ranged from 2744 to 131,868 mg/kg DM, or a 48-fold variation from
  lowest to highest value, with malvidin-3-_O_-glucoside being the predominant anthocyanin
  followed by peonidin-3-_O_-glucoside; (c) the content of phenolic acids was much
  lower than that of anthocyanins and varied significantly among samples of different
  vintages, with caftaric acid being the predominant compound in all samples; (d)
  with the exception of the 3-flavan-3-ols in the seeds that ranged up to several
  grams per kilogram of dry matter, anthoxanthins and stilbenes were minor components;
  and (e) aside from lack of anthocyanins,there were no major differences in total,
  but there were differences among individual phenolic compounds among pomaces from
  red and white grapes.
- (28) The TPC of pomace extracts from five Turkish grape cultivars ranged from 6.63
  to 20.1 mg/g.
- (32, 33) Levels of 19 individual phenolic compounds in the extracts ranged from
  0.0031 mg/g for _trans-_ resveratrol to 50.83 mg/g for (+)-catechin.
- An evaluation of Moroccan Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and Syrah red wine fractions
  against four Gram-positive bacteria, nine Gram-negative bacteria, two yeasts, and
  four molds showed that the Cabernet Sauvignon wine, as well as fractions with the
  highest monomeric anthocyanin content, were the most active, suggesting that these
  compounds largely contribute to the antimicrobial effects associated with wine components.
- '(34)


  The high phenolic content of grape pomace is due to the fact that some of these
  bioactive compounds are poorly extracted into the wine during the vinification process.'
- Environmental factors, such as climate and soil, and grape variety also influence
  the composition of the pomaces.
- '(35)


  These results indicate that studies on bioactivities of grape pomace, skins, and
  seeds need to take into account compositional differences among the test substances.'
- For example, juicemaking pomace from Cabernet Sauvignon wine is a better source
  of anthocyanins for use in functional foods than winemaking pomace.
- '(36, 37)



  Grape seed extracts derived from whole grape seeds are a rich source of bioactive
  flavonoids such as resveratrol, oligomeric procyanidins, and linoleic acid.'
- Microencapsulation has the potential to reduce the astringency and bitterness of
  grape seed extracts for use as a functional food.
- '(38) An HPLC analysis of fatfree grape seeds extracted with acetone/water/acetic
  acid (90:9.5:0.5) showed the following contribution of nine procyanidins to the
  total (in %): monomers, 48; dimers, 16.5; trimers, 10.8; tetramers, 8.1; pentamers,
  5.3; hexamers, 3.2; heptamers, 2.7; octamers, 3.0; and nonamers, 1.5.'
- '(39, 40)


  Analysis by HPLC and LC-DAD/ESI-MS revealed the presence of the following classes
  of bioactive compounds in the seeds from pomace: (a) phenolic acids—caffeic, gallic,
  protocatechuic, 4-hydroxybenzoic, and syringic; (b) flavonoids—(+)-catechin, catechin
  dimer, (−)-epicatechin, epicatechin gallate trimer, procyanidin B1, procyanidin
  B2, quercetin-3-_O_-rhamnoside, _trans_-polydatin, and _trans_-resveratrol; and
  (c) total phenolic content of 327.6 gallic acid equivalents (GAE)/g extract.'
- (41) A related study reported a total phenolic content of 628 mg GAE/g in grape
  seed extracts originating from Turkey.
- '(20)


  Analysis of grape seeds and pomaces derived from six French grape varieties showed
  that the highest total phenolic content of 44.5 GAE/g dry wt was present in Alicante
  seeds compared with 31.6 GAE/g dry wt for pomace.'
- (42) Additional studies showed pomaces also contained significant amounts of proanthocyanidins
  and anthocyanin glycosides and that seeds had the highest antioxidant capacity.
- Related studies found that (a) the percentage of prodelphinidins in the seed and
  skin extracts of two Croatian grape cultivars was negatively correlated with the
  bitterness (astringency) intensity of the skins(43) and (b) a grape seed proanthocyanidin
  extract improved the psychological and physical symptoms and reduced blood pressure
  in middle-aged menopausal women.
- '(44)



  The following selected results indicate that grape stems and leaves are additional
  sources of bioactive phenolic compounds.'
- Püssa et al.
- (45) reported that grapevine _Vitis vinifera_ stems contained _trans_-resveratrol
  and derivatives, flavan-3-ols, and phenolic acid glucosides.
- 'A factorial design and response surface method used to assess the extractability
  of phenolic compounds from the stems of three grape varieties followed by GC-MS
  analysis showed the presence of the following compounds: caffeic acid, flavanols,
  and derivatives, dehydroflavanols, and flavonols.'
- (46) An evaluation of byproducts from 10 different grape varieties showed that stems
  from Callet, Syrah, Premsal Blanc, Parellada, and Mano Negro varieties contained
  the highest total phenolic and total proanthocyanidin content and showed the greatest
  antioxidant capacity; that Chardonnay and Merlot stems showed the lowest values;
  that no significant differences were apparent among stems from red or white varieties;
  and that the stems from the Callet variety are an especially rich source of polyphenols.
- (47) Results from a study on copigmentation effects of pomace, skins, seeds, and
  stem extracts suggest the possibility of reusing the byproducts to improve the biological
  value and color properties of red wines.
- (48) Grape stem extracts inhibited the growth of breast, colon, renal, and thyroid
  cancer cells,(49) suggesting that stem phenolics might also inhibit microbial cells.
- Grapevine _V.
- vinifera_ leaves contained flavonols, flavones, and stilbenes.
- (50) Flavonols slow the infection of grapevine leaves by _Plasmopara viticola_ phytopathogens.
- (51) The total phenolic content of leaves from organically and conventionally grown
  _Vitis labrusca_ plants was similar, but the organic leaves contained 10 times more
  resveratrol than did the conventional leaves.
- (52) Whether grapevine leaves can serve as an inexpensive source of bioactive phenolic
  compounds merits study.
- Because sensory properties of wines affect consumption and bioactivity, we present
  here summaries of selected studies on the relationship between composition and sensory
  properties such as astringency, bitterness, bouquet, color, flavor, and taste.
- '(53-57)


  An investigation of the sensory, olfactory, and hedonic properties of Italian wines
  showed that Italian students liked about equally wines prepared from grapes grown
  organically and conventionally and that 61% of respondents were willing to pay more
  for organically produced wines.'
- (58) A study designed to define the relationship between phenolic composition and
  color of wines produced by 55 different grape samples found that the average ratios
  between wine and grape phenolics ranged from 0.25 and 7.9 for the different phenolic
  compounds, that individual wine phenolics correlated with several wine phenolics,
  and that there was a high correlation between predicted and measured total wine
  color (_r_ = 0.958), suggesting that it is possible to predict the color and quality
  of fresh wines from grape measurements.
- (59) Ethyl phenylacetate, phenylacetic acid, and γ-decalactone were found to be
  key aroma compounds in sour rotten wines at levels above those found in controls,
  suggesting that rot infection affects sensory properties of Portuguese wines.
- (60, 61) Measurements of the phenolic composition of grapes and wines from two maturity
  stages and two maturation times showed that (a) grape anthocyanin increased during
  ripening, (b) procyanidin content of wine decreased with extraction and maceration
  time, (c) wine made from riper grapes contained higher tannin levels, and (d) the
  color of the French wines was related to the content of anthocyanins and anthocyanin–tannin
  adducts, suggesting that sensory quality is linked to grape quality at harvest.
- (62, 63) Storage of sweet red wines in the bottle for a year caused degradation
  of monomeric anthocyanins, with most of them being lost between 6 and 9 months,
  the appearance of stable oligomeric and polymeric pyranoanthocyanin and methylmethine-mediated
  condensation products, hydrolysis of glycosylated flavonols to aglycones, and retention
  of antioxidative and sensory properties.
- (55) By contrast, increasing storage temperature seems to reduce the antioxidative
  properties of California wines, especially Cabernet Sauvignon and other Chardonnay
  varieties.
- (64, 65) Analysis of 67 red French wines showed that 3-methyl-2,4-nonadione is a
  good marker for defining quantitative changes in the oxidative potential.
- '(66)


  Related recent studies on the relationship between composition and sensory properties
  include (a) analytical characterization of red wines by aroma wheels;(67, 68) (b)
  apparent relationships between starter cultures, sensory and chemical attributes,
  and consumer acceptance of South African wines;(67, 68) (c) changes in composition
  and organoleptic properties of wines stored in wooden barrels;(43, 69) (d) the sensory
  quality of Cabernet wines related to grape quality at harvest and to anthocyanin,
  proanthocyanidins, and grape volatiles;(54, 63, 70, 71) and (e) the greater impact
  of large-sized, water-soluble tannins on wine astringency and bitterness of Cabernet
  Sauvignon wines relative to smaller-sized hydrophobic, highly pigmented tannins.'
- (72, 73) Additional studies on sensory aspects include those by Vidal et al.,(74)
  Malherbe et al.,(75) Bindon et al.,(53) Schmidtke et al.,(76) Villamor and Ross,(77)
  and Ugliano.
- '(78)


  The cited studies suggest that grape composition, winemaking practices, and storage
  conditions significantly affect sensory and presumably health-promoting properties
  of wines.'
- It is not known to what extent, if any, these complex relationships might also affect
  antimicrobial properties.
- Here, we will briefly highlight some of the biomarkers that have been reported to
  be related to the beneficial effects of wine compounds at the molecular and cellular
  levels that might be related to bioactivities of wines and wine compounds.
- Italian red wine induced the release of nitric oxide and both anti-inflammatory
  and pro-inflammatory cytokines in healthy human blood mononuclear cells, leading
  to the maintenance of the immune host; removal of the polyphenols from red wine
  abrogated these effects.
- (79) Exposure of macrophages stimulated by bacterial lipopolysaccharide to malvidin,
  the most abundant polyphenolic compound in red wine, induced a series of cellular
  and signaling events that protect cells against inflammation-mediated chronic diseases,
  suggesting that malvidin significantly contributes to the anti-inflammatory and
  antioxidant effects of red wine.
- (80, 81) A human study with 67 high cardiovascular risk male volunteers found that
  the phenolic content of red wines may modulate leukocyte adhesion molecules and
  that ethanol polyphenols of red wine may modulate soluble inflammatory mediators
  in high-risk patients, suggesting that both ethanol and nonalcoholic compounds contribute
  to the anti-inflammatory effects.
- (82) On the basis of a review of the literature on the anti-inflammatory properties
  of flavonoids from different sources in humans, Peluso et al.
- (83) suggest the need for placebo-controlled trials to identify bioactive flavonoids
  in the anti-inflammatory effect of plant foods, including wines.
- On the basis of the mechanism that seems to govern the anti-inflammatory action
  of a red wine extract, Nunes et al.
- (84) suggest that the wine extract may represent a simple and inexpensive therapeutic
  strategy against intestinal inflammation.
- This suggestion is supported by the observation that a grape seed extract enhances
  the chemotherapy of colon cancer in rats by the drug 5-fluorouracil by decreasing
  the severity of inflammation-related mucositis of the cancer cells.
- (85) Because macrophage cells associated with the immune system seem to have a strong
  affinity for pathogenic bacteria, and natural compounds protected mice against lethal
  effects of _Salmonella_ via immunostimulation,(86-89) expectations are that wine
  flavonoids might exhibit similar in vivo antibiotic effects.
- As illustrated by the following selected recent studies, the antioxidative properties
  of wine compounds seem to be paramount in neutralizing adverse effects of reactive
  oxygen species (ROS, free radicals) that induce oxidative stress in tissues that
  contributes to the cause of chronic diseases.
- Free radicals are highly reactive, short-lived molecules that can react with and
  damage essential structural proteins, enzymes, and DNA.
- Such damage has the potential to cause cancer, atherosclerosis, and cardiovascular
  and other diseases.
- Wine flavonoids have the potential to reduce such undesirable molecular events because
  the high-energy, highly reactive free electron on DNA is transformed to a less reactive
  and thus less damaging radical.
- Wine antioxidants inhibit the activation of the oxidative stress-related transcription
  nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) that participates in the regulation of inflammatory responses.
- '(90)


  A study of the effect of acute and chronic consumption by 19 obese men of red wine
  or dealcoholized red wine showed that consumption of moderate, but not high, amounts
  of red wine acutely increased plasma total antioxidant capacity (TEAC) and suppressed
  NF-κB activation, whereas chronic red wine, but not dealcoholized red wine, consumption
  increased oxidative lipid damage.'
- (91) Romanian scientists found that mathematical modeling of red wines from different
  grape varieties showed that 57% of the observed variance in antioxidant capacity
  is linearly related to the age of the wines(92) and that neural networks can be
  used to predict antioxidant activities and classification of wines.
- (93) A Canadian study found that red wine intake by 12 healthy human volunteers
  induced a marked increase in salivary radical-scavenging activity within 30 min
  followed by a plateau up to 240 min, suggesting that the wine greatly improved the
  salivary antioxidant status.
- (94) An Australian study found that warmer climate wines had lower in vitro antioxidant
  capacity values but retained good ex vivo bioavailability compared to cool climate
  wines, suggesting the need for further studies of the effect of soil composition
  on the polyphenolic content.
- (95) A Slovakian in vitro interaction study of three red wine polyphenols and their
  mixtures found that the antioxidant activity of individual polyphenols is not a
  constant value in the presence of other polyphenols, suggesting that the antioxidant
  quality of individual polyphenols differs markedly when tested separately and in
  mixtures, presumably because interactions can cause additive, antagonistic, and
  synergistic effects.
- (96) The authors suggest the need for in vivo studies, where interactions among
  compounds always take place in a mixture.
- It is also worth noting that wine antioxidative properties seem to be influenced
  differently by each polyphenolic compound(97) and that the antioxidant potential
  of GSEs is 20- and 50-fold greater than those of vitamins C and E.(98) We do not
  know whether antioxidative properties of wine flavonoids correlate with antibiotic
  effects.
- To balance the largely beneficial properties of wines, here, we briefly mention
  some possible adverse effects of wine components.
- Moderate consumption (one or two glasses per day) of red wines with an alcohol content
  of 12–13% has been associated with numerous health benefits mentioned earlier.
- Both alcohol and polyphenolic compounds of wine seem to contribute to these beneficial
  effects.
- To what extent, if any, excess consumption of wine might adversely affect human
  health merits study.
- Wine contains a class of compounds called biogenic amines naturally present in grapes
  and/or produced by amino acid transaminase induced transamination of aldehydes by
  decarboxylation of amino acids by microbial enzymes.
- Because the biogenic amines are reported to cause various symptoms in susceptible
  humans associated with allergic reaction,(99-101) there is an interest in their
  content in different wine varieties.
- For example, the analysis of 67 Italian wines showed that red wines contained 19.3
  mg/L total biogenic amines, rose wines, 9.2 mg/L, and white wines, 7.67 mg/L, with
  histamine, tyramine, and cadaverine as the most representative amines.
- '(102)



  Bioactive compounds from wines and other foods can occasionally inhibit cytosolic
  sulfotransferases (SULTs) that catalyze the sulfonation (metabolism) of catecholamines
  (dopamine, epinephrine), resulting in increased plasma levels of these bioactive
  compounds that can trigger migraine headache, increased blood pressure, and atrial
  fibrillation.'
- '(103)



  Low levels of d-amino acids (d-Ala, d-Glu, and d-Lys) are produced by _Saccharomyces
  cerevisiae_ and _Oenococcus oeni_ during fermentation of wine.'
- (104) Another study(105) found that the concentrations of d-amino amino acids relative
  to the corresponding l-enantiomers ranged for white wines from 0.4 to 3.9% d-Ala,
  from 0.9 to 8.3% d-Asx, and from 0.5 to 8.9% d-Glx; in red wines, from 2.9 to 10.6%
  d-Ala, from 2.2 to 10.9% d-Asx, and from 3.9 to 7.4% d-Glx.
- Storage times of bottled wines up to 24 years did not correlate with d-amino acid
  content.
- Studies on the nutrition and safety of d-amino acids reported that d-Lys is not
  bioavailable as a source of l-Lys and that certain d-amino amino acids inhibited
  the growth of mice.
- '(106, 107)



  Analysis of 32 different wines showed that the average homocysteine content, an
  amino acid that is linked to cardiovascular disease(106, 108) and to macular edema
  and neuropathy in patients with type 2 diabetes,(109) was 10.31 and 6.11 μM and
  in red and white wines, respectively.'
- '(110)



  The possible human carcinogen ochratoxin A produced by _Aspergillus_ and _Penicillium_
  fungal species(111) was found to be present in about 50% of all evaluated wines
  at levels that are generally lower than the European Union (EU) regulatory level
  of 2 μg/L.'

  Sulfites added to wines as antimicrobial preservatives to extend shelf life may
  aggravate symptoms of allergic asthma.'
- (8, 118, 119) Wine labels suggest that susceptible individuals need to be aware
  of the possible adverse effects of wines.
- With the above brief overview of wine composition, sensory properties, bioactivities,
  and possible adverse effects as background, reported studies on the antimicrobial,
  antiviral, and antifungal potential of wines and wine byproducts, in culture, in
  vivo, and on/in food will now be described.
- This section presents brief overviews of reported studies on the growth inhibition
  of bacteria that can cause human illness.
- The individual pathogens are listed alphabetically followed by studies that cover
  multiple pathogens.
- General comments concerning pathogenicity are based on information listed in a book
  on foodborne pathogens(120) and in _The Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy_.
- '(121)



  This foodborne pathogen causes vomiting and diarrhea.'
- A study on wine-induced inactivation of _B.
- cereus_ found that (a) wine inactivated _B.
- cereus_ cultures to undetectable levels in &lt;10 s, (b) wine diluted with water
  was less effective, (c) _B.
- cereus_ spores were highly resistant to inactivation, (d) wine organic acids strongly
  inhibited vegetative cells, (e) wine phenolic compounds were inactive, and (f) the
  addition of wine to a simulated intestine resulted in a reduction of the total number
  of vegetative cells and spores.
- (122) It can be suggested that these results show that drinking wine with a meal
  or consumption as a marinade might reduce the viable _B.
- cereus_ organisms, thus lowering the toxic potential of this pathogen.
- A related study reported that tea catechins and theaflavins and whole teas exhibited
  exceptionally high activity against _B.
- cereus_.
- '(123)



  This pathogen causes the gastrointestinal infection in humans called campylobacteriosis.'
- A kinetic study on the inactivation of _C.
- jejuni_ showed that (a) a Portuguese red wine rapidly inactivated the foodborne
  pathogen within 30 s, (b) ethanol and organic acid (malic, tartaric) wine fractions
  acted synergistically with an efficacy similar to that of wine itself, and (c) wine
  enhanced the anti-_Campylobacter_ effect of a food- and gastric fluid-containing
  model stomach, suggesting that concurrent ingestion of wine with food might help
  prevent campylobacteriosis.
- (124) Related studies reported that _C.
- jejuni_ was about 100 times more susceptible to inhibition by plant essential oils,
  oil compounds, and phenolic acids than three other foodborne pathogens.

  conditions found that (a) red wine induced a 3–4 log CFU reduction of the initial
  pathogen count in &lt;2 h, (b) the combination of ethanol and malic and tartaric
  acids was less effective than wine, and (c) the kinetics of the bactericidal effect
  of white wine differed from that of red wine, showing that the antimicrobial effects
  of wines depend on composition.
- (127) These results imply that ingestion of wine with food may reduce the _Listeria_
  level in the alimentary tract.
- This phytopathogen, the cause of halo bean blight, was inhibited by Hungarian red
  wines and, to a less extent, by white wines, with the inhibition directly related
  to the phenolic content of the wines.

  Wines are multicomponent solutions.'
- Wine properties and components that have been reported to possess antimicrobial
  properties include acid pH (∼3.00), alcohol (∼12%), sulfur dioxide (sulfite), organic
  acids (caftaric, lactic), and numerous polyphenolic compounds.
- A factorial design study on the susceptibilities of _E.
- coli_ O157:H7 and _S.
- aureus_ to 20 min exposure to four of these factors(129) revealed the importance
  of pH, titratable acidity, and ethanol, but not total sulfur dioxide, in predicting
  inactivation, suggesting that lowering the pH would likely enhance the efficacy
  of the other parameters.
- The paramount role of phenolic compounds in inhibiting bacteria was not evaluated.
- A study of the contribution of polyphenolic content, pH, ethanol content, and other
  components to the observed antimicrobial effects of Croatian wines against _E.
- coli_ and _S.
- 'enterica_ found the following order of activities: wine &gt; phenol-stripped wine
  &gt; dealcoholized wine &gt; ethanol at low pH &gt; low pH &gt; ethanol, suggesting
  the antimicrobial efficacy of wine cannot be attributed to a specific component.'
- (130) The average TPC of these wines (in mg GAE/L) was 3204; flavonoids, 2941; nonflavonoids,
  262.6; catechins, 726.6.
- Anthocyanins were found at 239.7 mg M-3-G/L, and resveratrol was found at 2.00 mg/L.
- A study of three Argentinean wine varieties found that (a) the TPC content of the
  Cabernet Sauvignon wine (2300 mg/L GAE) was lower than those of Malbec (2522 mg/L
  GAE) and Merlot (2704 mg/L GAE) varieties; (b) the relative antimicrobial activities
  against _E.
- coli_ and _L.
- monocytogenes_ in a meat model treated with 100 and 200 mg/L of isolated phenolic
  compounds paralleled the phenolic content of the wines; and (c) the polyphenol effect
  was ethanol-independent, suggesting that phenolic content governs activity and the
  need to produce new wine varieties with high polyphenolic content.
- '(131)



  A study of the antimicrobial effects of three Argentinean wines with different phenolic
  contents against multiple organisms showed that _E.'
- coli_ was the most sensitive bacterium to Merlot wine and that clarified wines,
  prepared by exposure of red wines to charcoal to remove phenolic compounds, were
  inactive.
- '(132)


  A study of the composition and antioxidative and antimicrobial effect of six Serbian
  wines prepared from different grape varieties against nine different pathogenic
  bacteria showed that the contents of two wine flavonoids, quercetin and quercetin-3-glucoside,
  can be used as biochemical markers for antioxidative and antimicrobial bioactivities.'
- '(133)


  An evaluation of Moroccan Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and Syrah red wine fractions
  against four Gram-positive bacteria, nine Gram-negative bacteria, two yeasts, and
  four molds showed that the Cabernet Sauvignon wine, as well as fractions with the
  highest monomeric anthocyanin content, were the most active, suggesting that these
  compounds largely contribute to the antimicrobial effects associated with wine components.'
- '(34)



  An analytical and antimicrobial study of the polyphenolic profile of GSEs from seven
  red and seven white Croatian grape varieties showed that (a) the total phenols,
  flavonoids, catechins, flavanols, and individual polyphenols [(+)-catechin, (−)-epicatechin,
  epicatechin gallate, procyanidins B1 and B2, quercetin glucoside, resveratrol monomers,
  piceid, and astringin] was variety dependent; (b) the TPC (&gt;70 mg/g DM) of red
  skins of red cultivars were much higher in phenolic content than the skins from
  white cultivars (&gt;20 mg); (b) antioxidative properties were related to polyphenolic
  content; (c) the average content of highly bioactive _trans_-resveratrol of 0.29
  mg/kg of fresh berry wt was lower than the corresponding value of 0.59 mg/kg of
  fresh berry wt in the extracts from the red varieties; (d) the corresponding values
  for _cis_-resveratrol were 0.30 and 0.80 mg/kg of fresh berry wt, respectively;
  (e) minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values against multiple organisms (Gram-positive
  _B.'
- cereus_ and _S.

  of white cultivars against _E.
- coli_ and _Salmonella_, the most frequent causes of foodborne infections, were the
  lowest (highest activity).

  Although present in small amounts in wine, resveratrol is probably the most widely
  studied flavonoid.'
- (135-137) This phytoalexin phenolic compound is reported to inhibit the growth of
  microbial species (_S.
- aureus_, _Enterococcus faecalis_, and _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_) as well as several
  pathogenic fungal dermatophytes that cause skin infections,(138) to inhibit biofilm
  formation of _E.
- coli_ O157:H7 and _P.
- aeruginosa_,(139, 140) and _V.
- cholerae_,(141) to reduce the growth rates of numerous animal-associated bacteria
  in culture,(142) and to exhibit cytotoxicity against _T.
- vaginalis_, the cause of the sexually transmitted disease trichomoniasis.
- (143) It seems that resveratrol exhibits antimicrobial, antiparasitic, and anti-inflammatory
  properties that have the potential to benefit microbial food safety and human infections.
- We previously reported that this olive compound inhibited both the growth of foodborne
  pathogens and the biological activity of a bacterial toxin.
- (111, 144, 145) Because 30 Spanish red wines contained an average of 0.074 mg/L
  of 4-hydroxytyrosol,(146, 147) the compound probably contributes to the antimicrobial
  properties of wines.
- A study of the effect of the consumption of Spanish Merlot red and dealcoholized
  red wines by 10 healthy volunteers for 4 weeks showed (a) a significantly increased
  number of native gut bacteria and (b) decreased blood pressure and cholesterol,
  triglyceride, and C-reactive plasma levels.
- The results of this in vivo study suggest that a moderate consumption of red wine
  can inhibit nonbeneficial bacteria from the human microbiota and stimulate the growth
  of probiotic bifidobacteria.
- (148) A related study found large interindividual differences in microbial metabolites
  in human feces following the consumption of red wine and dealcoholized red wine,
  suggesting differences in gut microbial composition among evaluated subjects.
- (149) These investigators also analyzed by HPLC the total and individual polyphenolic
  profile of the two wines.
- Dealcoholized red wine had the same composition of polyphenolic compounds as red
  wine, with respective TPC values of 733 and 798 GAE.
- Individual polyphenolic compounds consisted of six anthocyanins, three flavonols,
  four stilbenes, six flavan-3-ols, two hydroxybenzoic acids, four hydroxycinnamic
  acids, and tyrosol.
- Here, we briefly describe the reported protection of wine marinades against adverse
  effects of foodborne pathogens and spoilage organisms on meat products.

  We developed a series of antimicrobial wine marinade recipes each consisting of
  red or white wine extracts of oregano leaves with added garlic juice and oregano
  oil, against _B.'
- cereus_, _E.
- coli_ O157:H7, _L.
- monocytogenes_, and _S.
- enterica_.
- (157) The results showed that (a) activities increased with incubation temperatures
  in the order 37 °C &gt; 21 °C &gt; 4 °C, (b) storage for up to 2 months did not
  affect activities against _Salmonella_, (c) combinations of antimicrobials in wine
  exhibited additive antimicrobial effects, and (d) polyphenolic compounds isolated
  by chromatography separation from red wine exhibited exceptional activity at nanogram
  levels against two strains of _B.
- cereus_.
- The cited beneficial effects seem to have stimulated interest in defining the efficacy
  of wine marinades against contaminated meat products outlined below.
- The populations of _Carnobacterium maltaromaticum_, _L.
- monocytogenes_, _Brochothrix thermosphacta_, and _C.
- jejuni_ bacteria were reduced by ∼1.5, 2, 3, and 6 log CFU, respectively, on contaminated
  pork meat submerged into Spanish red wine for 15 min followed by storage at 4 °C
  for 3 days.
- (151) Except for _C.
- maltaromaticum_, ultrasound treatment with red wine acted synergistically against
  the pathogens, suggesting that marinating can be used to enhance the taste, texture,
  and safety of pork meat counts (7 log CFU/mL) and low counts (3 logs CFU/mL) of
  _C.
- jejuni_.
- The bacteria were completely inactivated in both white and red wines.
- Immersion of poultry meat contaminated with this pathogen in both wine marinades
  was less effective in reducing the microbial levels.
- '(152)


  Immersion of contaminated beef fillets in Greek red wine or wine supplemented with
  0.3% thyme oil for 12 h significantly reduced the levels of acid-adapted and -nonadapted
  _S.'
- enterica_ Typhimurium compared to nonmarinated control samples by 2.0 and 1.9 log
  CFU/g, respectively, during storage for 19 days at 5 °C.
- (155) The addition of thyme oil to the wine seems to increase the antimicrobial
  effect of marinades, suggesting the marinating can be used to extend the shelf life
  of meats.
- Greek red wine with and without 0.5% oregano oil induced reduced levels of _S.
- enterica_ and _L.
- monocytogenes_ on contaminated beef pieces after storage at 5 °C for 18 h by 2.1
  and 3.4 log CFU/cm2.
- (156) Because the addition of oregano oil enhanced the antimicrobial activity and
  no changes in heat resistance were apparent during storage of the beef samples,
  wine marinating can enhance both safety and shelf life.
- Marinating with soy sauce or red wine marinades can control oxidation and microbial
  spoilage of raw beef, suggesting that marinating can extend the shelf life of meat.

  As described in detail elsewhere, there is a need to reduce both pathogens and heat-induced
  potentially carcinogenic heterocyclic amines in cooked meat products.'
- (160, 161) Wine marinades without and with added herbs used as meat flavoring (garlic,
  ginger, thyme, rosemary, and red chilli peppers) reduced the formation of heterocyclic
  amines in pan-fried beef.
- (162) Additional studies found no correlation between the marinade-induced antioxidant
  activities and individual or total heterocyclic amine formation.
- (162) Related studies on the reduction of amine formation by wine-fried chicken
  breast are described by Brusquest et al.
- (163) The concurrent reduction of both pathogens and heterocyclic amines by wine
  marinades with added herbs merits study.
- Brannan found that 0.1% GSE inhibited the intensity of musty and rancid odor and
  rancid flavor, but caused color darkening, on ground chicken breast and thigh during
  refrigerated storage, suggesting that the seed extract may be an effective antioxidant
  in precooked chicken products.

  This section presents brief overviews of reported studies on the inhibition of growth
  and/or destruction of pathogenic microorganisms by GSEs.'
- GSE incorporated into pea starch films with pork loins infected with the psychotrophic
  spoilage organism _B.
- thermofacta_ reduced the bacterial growth on surface-inoculated pork loins by 1.3
  log CFU/mL after 4 days of incubation at 4 °C.
- '(20) Additional studies showed that GSE films also inhibited the growth of the
  following pathogens: _S.'
- aureus_, _E.
- faecalis_, _E.
- faecium_, and _L.
- monocytogenes_.
- The authors suggest that biodegradable and edible GSE antimicrobial films have the
  potential to improve meat quality and extend shelf life.
- _C.
- sakazakii_ is a Gram-negative, anaerobic bacterium of the family Enterobacteriaceae
  reported to cause infection in adults and children, especially infants.
- (165) Freshly prepared red muscadine grape juices induced a 6 log reduction of _C.
- sakazakii_ after a 2 h incubation at 37 °C, suggesting that red muscadine juice
  could inhibit the pathogen in baby food.
- '(166)



  _E.'
- coli_ O157:H7 is a foodborne, toxin-producing enteropathogen responsible for hemorrhagic
  colitis, bloody diarrhea, and hemolytic uremic syndrome.
- Here, we will briefly review reported activities of grape-derived products against
  this organism.
- A study on the effect of fresh and processed muscadine red grape juices against
  a 5 log cocktail of cells of _E.
- coli_ O157:H7 incubated for 4 h at 37 °C showed that polar fractions containing
  malic, tartaric, and tannic acids showed strong antimicrobial activity and that
  synthetic tannic acid showed the highest activity.
- (167) These results indicate that muscadine juice can be used as an active antimicrobial
  ingredient against these pathogens in nonalcoholic beverages.
- A related study by the same investigators(168) found that water-soluble muscadine
  GSE prepared from the purple cultivar Ison and the bronze cultivar Carlos exhibited
  strong antimicrobial activity against a cocktail of three strains of _E.
- coli_ O157:H7 and that heat treatment of both extracts increased antimicrobial activity,
  possibly because of increased acidity, tartaric acid, and individual and total phenolic
  content.
- These results suggest that water-soluble muscadine seed extracts could serve as
  natural preservatives in beverages.
- Electrostatic spraying of GSE onto contaminated lettuce and spinach samples with
  GSE alone and in combination with lactic, malic, or tartaric acids reduced _E.
- coli_ levels on spinach up to 4.0 log CFU/g and on spinach up 2.8 log CFU/g during
  the 14 day storage, suggesting that electrospraying technology could help lower
  risks due to pathogen contamination of fresh produce.

  Commercial grape seed and grape pomace extracts inhibited antitoxin properties of
  the Shiga toxins Stx1 and Stx2 produced by _E.'
- coli_ O157:H7 bacteria.
- (170) Because red and white wines and phenolic compounds isolated by chromatography
  from red wine exhibited strong antimicrobial activities against _E.
- coli_ and other pathogens,(123) it would be of interest to find out whether the
  wine compounds can concurrently or consecutively inactivate the foodborne pathogens
  and the toxins produced by the pathogens.
- We previously reviewed the inactivation of food-related microbial, fungal, and plant
  toxins by natural compounds.

  _H.'
- pylori_, a Gram-negative organism that has adapted to thrive in the acid conditions
  of the digestive tract, causes gastritis, peptic ulcers, and adenocarcinoma.
- To help overcome multidrug resistance, Brown et al.
- (171) evaluated the efficacy of muscadine grape skin and two polyphenolic constituents
  against _H.
- pylori_.
- They found that (a) grape skin and quercetin inhibited _H.
- pylori_ infection in mice; (b) quercetin and resveratrol reduced the bacterial counts
  of the pathogen with MIC values of 256 and 128 μg/mL, respectively; (c) grape skin
  extracts were more effective than the two constituents; and (d) the inhibitions
  were dose dependent and pH independent.
- (172) The observed anti-_H.
- pylori_ effects suggest that the extracts and components might be used in a diet-based
  approach for the prevention and/or treatment of _H.
- pylori_ infection.
- A related study found that a comparison of the inhibition of _H.
- pylori_ by grape seed, skin, and seed plus skin extracts of two grape varieties
  showed that the highest observed zone of inhibition was with the seed extracts,
  with MIC and minimum bactericidal concentration (BMC) values of 2048 μg/mL of the
  extracts of both varieties.
- '(172, 173)



  _K.'
- pneumoniae_ causes lung and urinary infections that occur mainly in hospital patients
  with diminished resistance.
- Because some isolates are resistant to medical antibiotics, there is a need for
  new antimicrobials to overcome infections associated with this pathogen.
- Ethanol extracts of grape seeds were found to be more effective in inhibiting _K.
- pneumoniae_ than were grape skin extracts, suggesting a potential value for the
  seed extract against human infections.
- (174) These authors also found that the seed extract was also active against _E.
- faecalis_ and _E.

- _L.
- monocytogenes_ is a Gram-positive foodborne bacterial pathogen that causes human
  listeriosis, with symptoms ranging from headaches to bacteremia, septicemia, encephalitis,
  and meningitis and a mortality rate of about 20–30%.
- (175) We now will record efforts to inactivate the pathogen with grape products.
- Grape juice and skin extracts from black table grapes strongly inhibited multiple
  _L.
- monocytogenes_ species but did not inhibit _B.
- cereus_, _Salmonella_ Menston, _E.
- coli_, _S.
- aureus_, or _Y.
- enterocolitica_ pathogens.
- (176) Fractionation of the extracts showed that the antilisterial activity was highest
  in the polymeric phenolic fractions, that activity of the red-pigmented fractions
  was pH dependent, and that the unpigmented polymeric phenolics from the seed showed
  pH-independent activity.
- The observed reduction was striking, from ∼log CFU7 to undetectable levels after
  10 min.
- Evidently, both pigmented and unpigmented phenolic compounds from grapes were bioactive
  against _Listeria_, but apparently not against the other mentioned pathogens.
- Chardonnay and black raspberry seed flour extracts at 165 and 160 μg seed flour
  equivalents/mL inhibited the growth of _L.
- monocytogenes_ and _E.
- coli_ with zero survival rates under the test conditions.
- These results and compositional and antioxidant activities suggest that the seed

  Dipping of surface-inoculated (log 6 CFU/g) turkey frankfurters into soy protein

  IU/mL) resulted in 2.8 log CFU reduction of _L.'
- monocytogenes_ after storage for 28 days at 4 or 10 °C, suggesting that the antilisterial
  activity of the combination was greater than that observed with the individual antimicrobials
  and that the use of antimicrobial films may enhance the microbial safety of meat
  products.
- (178) Because the combination of antimicrobials caused a much higher 9 log cycle
  reduction in culture, it seems that antimicrobial results in the absence of food
  do not predict the efficacy in a meat matrix.
- Dipping contaminated turkey frankfurters with 1% GSE plus nisin (6400 IU/mL) reduced
  the _L.
- monocytogenes_ population from ∼log 7 CFU/g to undetectable levels after storage
  at 4 or 10 °C for 21 days, suggesting that the combination can improve the antimicrobial
  efficacy against this pathogen in refrigerated ready-to-eat (RTE) meat and poultry
  storage.
- (179) A related study(180) found that soy protein edible films containing GSE, nisin,
  and EDTA were more effective in inhibiting the growth of _L.
- monocytogenes_ (reduction of 2.9 log CFU/mL) than _E.
- coli_ (1.8 log reduction) or _Salmonella_ Typhimurium (0.6 log reduction), suggesting
  that the susceptibility of the pathogens to inhibition is not uniform.
- Dipping turkey frankfurters contaminated with _L.

  coating incorporated with GSE (0.5%) and nisin (6000 IU/g) followed by storage for
  28 days at 4 °C reduced the bacterial population by 2.3, 4.6, and 1.0 log cycles,
  respectively, confirming that antimicrobial protein coatings can be used to inhibit
  foodborne pathogens in meat.

  solvent, fraction, and grape variety significantly influence antimicrobial properties.
- A weak but significant relationship was observed between TPC and antimicrobial effects
  (_r_ = 0.58).

- (196) The pomace extracts were more active against the bacteria than the skin extracts.
- All samples lost significant amounts of bioactive compounds during 16 weeks of storage,
  with freeze-dried samples retaining higher amounts of TPC than samples stored at
  ambient temperatures or 40 °C.
- The authors suggest that the two pomaces could be used as functional food ingredients
  that can promote human health.
- An evaluation of the antimicrobial efficacy of grape pomace powder and pomace extracts
  from Turkish grape varieties showed that a 10% concentration of the powder completely
  inhibited _S.

  against the following foodborne pathogens: _E.'
- coli_ O157:H7, _S.
- enterica_, _L.

- (144) The relative activities were evaluated using quantitative bactericidal activity
  (BA50 value, defined as the percentage of the sample in the assay mixture that resulted
  in a 50% decrease in colony-forming units).
- The BA50 values were determined by fitting the data to a sigmoidal curve by regression
  analysis using concentration–antimicrobial response data.
- Antimicrobial activity is indicated by a low BA50 value, meaning less material is
  needed to kill 50% of the bacteria.
- Olive pomace, olive juice powder, and oregano leaves were active against all four
  pathogens, suggesting that they behave as broad-spectrum antimicrobials.
- All powders exhibited strong antimicrobial activity against _S.

  extract (0.002%); olive pomace (0.008%); and GSE (0.016%).'
- _Listeria_ bacteria were also highly susceptible to apple skin extract (0.007%).
- The most active substances provide candidates for the evaluation of antimicrobial
  effectiveness in human foods and animal feeds.
- Several studies describe anticariogenic/cariostatic effects of grape products.
- These include the following observations.
- Phenolic extracts with highly variable anthocyanin and flavan-3-ol contents prepared
  from several red wine grape varieties and their fermented byproduct of winemaking
  (pomace) were highly effective against virulence traits of the dental pathogen _Streptococcus
  mutans_, suggesting their potential value against dental disease.
- (200-204) A study on bacterial adherence to enamel in the oral cavity of six human
  subjects revealed that rinses with red wine and teas induced up to a 66% reduction
  of adherent bacteria compared to controls, suggesting that these beverages might
  contribute to the prevention of biofilm-induced diseases in the oral cavity.

  A red wine GSE reduced plaque area on bovine teeth in an artificial mouth by 40%
  compared to the control.'
- This value was, however, lower than corresponding reductions of 84.0 and 87.5%,
  respectively, observed with _Salvia officinalis_ and _Rosmarinus officinalis_ plant
  extracts.
- (206) An evaluation of the antibacterial activities of wine phenolic compounds and
  GSEs against potential respiratory pathogens present in the oral cavity that contribute
  to the formation of dental plaque showed that (a) gallic acid and ethyl gallate
  had the highest activity, (b) two commercial GSEs were more active than the phenolic
  compounds, and (c) Gram-positive bacteria (_E.
- faecalis_, _S.
- aureus_, and _Streptococcus pneumoniae_) were more susceptible to inactivation than
  Gram-negative bacteria (_Moraxella catarrhalis_ and _P.
- aerations_).
- (207) Red wine alone and with added GSE inhibited oral microbiota in a five-species
  biofilm model of supragingival plaque.
- (208) These observations suggest the need to evaluate the germ-killing efficacy
  of wine compounds in oral rinses and chewing gums.
- Viral contamination of food and infection of animals and humans is a major cause
  of numerous diseases.
- The mechanism of antiviral action of plant polyphenolic compounds is based on their
  abilities to act as antioxidants, to inhibit essential enzymes, to disrupt cell
  membranes, to prevent viral binding and penetration into cells, and to trigger the
  host cell self-defense mechanism.
- (209) Here, we present a brief overview of reported studies on the antiviral activities
  of grape products against pathogenic viruses.
- A polyphenol-based grape extract from Portuguese white-winemaking byproducts and
  resveratrol reduced adenovirus-5 production by 4.5 and 6.5 log (TCID50/mL).
- In contrast to resveratrol, the extract irreversibly inhibited the replication of
  the adenovirus, suggesting its potential value as an antiviral agent.
- '(210)



  The wine polyphenolic compound resveratrol reduced human cytomegalovirus DNA replication
  to undetectable levels by blockage of epidermal growth factor receptor activation
  in human embryonic fibroblasts.'

  A study of the effect of commercial GSE on human enteric virus surrogates and hepatitis
  A virus evaluated the infectivity of the virus exposed to GSE concentrations of
  0.5, 1, and 2 mg/mL for 2 h at room temperature or 37 °C.'
- (212, 213) At high titer (∼log 7 PFU/mL), the infectivity was reduced by up to 4.61
  log PFU in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that GSE has the potential to be
  used by the food industry as an inexpensive novel natural broad-spectrum antiviral
  alternative to reduce viral contamination and enhance food safety and quality.
- The foodborne norovirus causes gastroenteritis and diarrhea in humans.
- An examination of the effect of GSE against the human norovirus by a plaque and
  other bioassays for murine norovirus found that GSE at 0.2 and 2 mg/mL reduced the
  infectivity by &gt;3 log PFU/mL of the murine virus and the binding of the human
  norovirus to salivary human histo-blood group antigen receptors.
- (213-215) The observed 1.5–2 log PFU/mL reduction in the murine virus titer following
  addition of 2 mg of GSE/mL to sanitized water in the washing bath of fresh-cut lettuce
  suggests the potential value of the treatment to reduce the viral burden of leafy
  greens.
- The mechanism of the antiviral effect seems to involve denaturation of the viral
  capsid protein.
- GSE was also effective against these viruses on contaminated produce.
- (215) Thus, treatment of lettuce and jalapeno peppers (25–30 g) inoculated with
  human norovirus surrogates (feline calicivirus and murine norovirus) or hepatitis
  A virus with 0.25, 0.5, 1 mg/mL GSE or water for 30 s–5 min reduced the viral counts
  from ∼7 log PFU/mL to 2.33, 2.58, and 2.71 log PFU on lettuce and to 2.20, 2.74,
  and 3.05 log PFU on peppers after 1 min at all three concentrations, respectively.
- The authors suggest that GSE should be considered for use as part of hurdle approaches
  that combine GSE with other antiviral treatments for foodborne virus reduction on
  produce.
- Exposure of rotaviruses, the most common cause of severe diarrhea in children, to
  grape and cranberry juices and proanthocyanidins resulted in a loss of viral infectivity
  after 5 min via blockage of viral antigenic determinants caused by modification
  of viral integrity at physiological pH, suggesting that the fruit juices may help
  protect against viral-induced diarrheas.
- (216, 217) A related study by Ko et al.
- (218) reported that an orally administered alcohol-free Cabernet Sauvignon red wine
  extract inhibited diarrhea in a neonatal mouse model of rotaviral infection, but
  did not prevent watery stools in the mice administered cholera toxin.
- '(219, 220)


  Nair et al.'
- (221) found that the flavonoid constituents of GSE seem to exert antiviral effects
  by inducing Th1-derived cytokine γ-interferon (IFN-γ) by peripheral mononuclear
  cells, suggesting that the beneficial immunostimulatory effect of GSE may be mediated
  through induction of IFN-γ.

  GPE fractions extracted with methanol or ethanol from a mixture of Chilean grape
  varieties exhibited in vitro antifungal activity against the phytopathogenic fungus
  _B.'
- cinerea_ that damages grapevines, resulting in extensive economic losses, suggesting
  that the pomace can provide a low-cost fungicide to help overcome this problem.
- Related studies reported that pomaces from other grape varieties inhibited the growth
  of _Zygosaccharomyces rouxii_ and _Zygosaccharomyces bailii_(32, 195) and that GPE
  from three Chilean grape varieties showed a large inhibitory effect on mycelia growth
  of _B.
- cinerea_ with an IC50 value of 50 ppm.
- '(30, 35)



  GPE from Brazilian Merlot grapes exhibited moderate activity against three fungal
  species (_C.'
- albicans_, _Candida krusei_, and _Candida parapsilosis_), with MIC values ranging
  from 500 to 1000 μg/mL.
- (41) GSE acted synergistically with the medicinal antibiotic amphotericin B against
  _C.
- albicans_, the most common cause of fungal disease in humans, suggesting that the
  combination with 75% less antibiotic merits use in human fungal infections.
- (223-225) The authors suggest that synergism of natural compounds such as GSE with
  medicinal antibiotics has the potential to benefit the fight against human infectious
  diseases.
- Phenolic red and white wine extracts also inhibit _C.
- albicans_.
- '(226)





  GSE from grapes and other plant extracts significantly decreased adverse effects
  in broiler chickens infected with the parasitic organisms (_E.'
- tenella_, _E.
- maxima_, and _E.
- acervulina_) that cause coccidiosis, a poultry disease that results in large economic
  losses.
- (227, 228) The protection involved decreased mortality and improved feed conversion
  ratio (FCR), suggesting that antioxidant-containing plant extracts may be of benefit
  in the management of coccidiosis.
- A related study reported that a 0.1% GSE inhibited the intensity of musty and rancid
  odor and rancid flavor in chicken breast compared with control patties, suggesting
  that the extract may be an effective antioxidant in precooked chicken breast.
- '(164, 229)



  Pomace flavanols and flavonols (122.75 and 23.11 mg/100 g dry pomace) from Zalema
  grapes seem to be responsible for the increased survival of _C.'
- elegans_ worms exposed to thermally induced oxidative stress.
- '(230)




  In addition to the research needs mentioned earlier, future studies need to address
  the following food and medical aspects of the properties of wines and wine flavonoids.'
- 'In this context the term “flavonoid” represents wines, grape pomace, seed, and
  skin extracts and their flavonoids.•


  Determine whether the antibiotic activities of flavonoids and wines in vitro can
  be duplicated in vivo, especially in humans.'
- Determine the relationship between wine consumption and lower risk of infection
  in humans.
- Will frequent consumption of red wine or flavonoids protect against infection and/or
  ameliorate the severity of infectious disease in humans?
- Determine how bioactivities of flavonoids vary, depending on whether they are tested
  or consumed in the free state or as part of a mixture or a food.
- Determine whether flavonoid metabolites formed after absorption into the circulation
  by animals and humans possess antimicrobial properties.
- Define additive or synergistic effects of mixtures of wine flavonoids with other
  plant antimicrobials, including plant essential oils, apple, and olive compounds,
  and seashell-derived chitosans.
- Combinations of food ingredients that act synergistically will lessen amounts needed
  to design effective antimicrobial food formulations.
- They will be safer and affect flavor and taste less than individual compounds.
- Evaluate the effectiveness of wines and flavonoids against antibiotic resistant
  foodborne and medical pathogens, a largely unexplored area.
- '(231-234)



  Determine whether flavonoids can additively or synergistically enhance antibiotic
  properties of medicinal antibiotics.'
- Determine whether wine flavonoids can protect against bacterial infection through
  stimulation of the immune system.
- '(88, 89, 235)



  Determine antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal, and antitoxin efficacies of wines
  and flavonoids in various contaminated foods including leafy greens, fruits and
  fruit juices, vegetables, dairy, meat, poultry, and seafood products.'
- Develop methods to simultaneously reduce both pathogens and carcinogenic heterocyclic
  amine levels in processed meat products.
- Develop flavonoid-containing edible antimicrobial films and coatings to protect
  food against contamination by pathogens.
- Determine whether flavonoids can prevent biofilm formation by bacteria on contaminated
  food.
- Determine whether the flavonoid content of wines and byproducts can predict antibiotic
  activities.
- Determine whether molecular modeling of flavonoid structure–cell membrane interactions
  can be used to explain the antibiotic mechanisms of structurally different flavonoids.
- '(236-238)




  In summary, because grape phenolic phytonutrients are considered to be generally
  accepted as safe, the cited and proposed studies will provide numerous benefits.'
- The most active compounds could be used to protect liquid and solid foods against
  contamination by pathogenic and spoilage microorganisms and microbial toxins as
  well as therapeutically to treat animal and human infections.
- The grape pomace, seed, and skin extracts have the potential to provide inexpensive
  sources of compounds for use against a broad range of diseases.
- These byproducts will also provide a source of income to grape growers and wine
  producers.
- Growers will be encouraged to produce grapes with high levels of bioactive compounds.
- I am most grateful to Carol E. Levin for assistance with the preparation of the
  manuscript, to colleagues for excellent scientific collaboration, and to journal
