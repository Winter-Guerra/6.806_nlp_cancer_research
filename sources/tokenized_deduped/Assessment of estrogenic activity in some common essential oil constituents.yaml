- Estrogenic responses have not only been associated with endocrine function, but
  also with cognitive function.
- Several studies have indicated that estrogen replacement therapy has favourable
  effects on cognition, and may have potential in the prevention and treatment of
  Alzheimer's disease.
- Thus, ligands for the estrogen receptor, that have a better efficacy and adverse-effect
  profile than drugs currently available, require investigation.
- This study was undertaken to investigate the potential estrogenic activity of a
  number of essential oil constituents.
- Initially, estrogenic activity was determined by a sensitive and specific bioassay
  using recombinant yeast cells expressing the human estrogen receptor.
- At high concentrations, estrogenic activity was detected for citral (geranial and
  neral), geraniol, nerol and trans-anethole, while eugenol showed anti-estrogenic
  activity.
- Molecular graphics studies were undertaken to identify the possible mechanisms for
  the interaction of geranial, neral, geraniol, nerol and eugenol with the ligand-binding
  domain of the estrogen α-receptor, using the computer program HyperChem.
- Citral, geraniol, nerol and eugenol were also able to displace [3H]17β-estradiol
  from isolated α\- and β-human estrogen receptors, but none of these compounds showed
  estrogenic or anti-estrogenic activity in the estrogen-responsive human cell line
  Ishikawa Var I at levels below their cytotoxic concentrations, and none showed activity
  in a yeast screen for androgenic and anti-androgenic activity.
- The potential in-vivo estrogenic effects of citral and geraniol were examined in
  ovariectomized mice, but neither compound showed any ability to stimulate the characteristic
  estrogenic responses of uterine hypertrophy or acute increase in uterine vascular
  permeability.
- These results show that very high concentrations of some commonly used essential
  oil constituents appear to have the potential to interact with estrogen receptors,
  although the biological significance of this is uncertain.
