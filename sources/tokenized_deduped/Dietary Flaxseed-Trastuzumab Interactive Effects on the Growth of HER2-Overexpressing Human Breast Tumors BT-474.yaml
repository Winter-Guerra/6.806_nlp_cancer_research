- Flaxseed (FS) reduces breast tumorigenesis and human epidermal growth factor receptor
  2 (HER2) expression in postmenopausal patients and animal models.
- The primary treatment for HER2-overexpressing tumors is trastuzumab (TRAS).
- FS oil enhances TRAS effectiveness in athymic mice but the FS effect is unknown
  and was therefore determined.
- Athymic mice with established BT-474 tumors were fed the basal diet (control), or
  10% FS diet, with or without TRAS (2.5mg/kg) treatment for 5 wk.
- After 2 wk, TRAS and FS reduced tumor size with a trend for an FS × TRAS interaction;
  however, after 5 wk, only TRAS reduced tumor size and increased tumor apoptosis.
- FS did not further improve TRAS effect but increased overall survival.
- TRAS reduced signaling biomarkers [phosphorylated HER2 and mitogen-activated protein
  kinase (MAPK) proteins; Akt1, Akt2, MAPK, and estrogen receptor-α mRNA], FS reduced
  phosphorylated-Akt1 protein, and FS × TRAS interactions were seen for HER2 mRNA
  and phosphorylated-Akt1 protein.
- FS, with and without TRAS, increased tumor n-3 PUFA levels and serum lignans indicating
  potential roles in the observed effect.
- In conclusion, TRAS reduces tumor growth by influencing HER2 signaling.
- Dietary FS has minimal tumor-reducing effect, does not interfere with TRAS action,
  but improves overall survival in athymic mice.
