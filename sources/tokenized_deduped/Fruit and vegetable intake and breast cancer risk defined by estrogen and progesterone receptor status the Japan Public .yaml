- Epidemiological evidence for the impact of fruit and vegetable intake on breast
  cancer risk among the Japanese populations is scarce.
- The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association between fruit and vegetable
  intake and breast cancer risk among 47,289 Japanese women.
- The study was conducted under a population-based prospective cohort design.
- Dietary assessment was performed using a validated food frequency questionnaire.
- A Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to calculate relative risks
  (RRs) and their corresponding 95 % confidence intervals (CIs).
- During an average of 10.2 years of follow-up, 452 cases of breast cancer were newly
  diagnosed.
- No association with breast cancer risk was seen for intake of total fruits and vegetables,
  cruciferous vegetables, green-leaf vegetables, yellow vegetables, or tomato products
  in overall or postmenopausal women.
- Cruciferous vegetable intake was associated with a statistically significant decrease
  in risk of premenopausal breast cancer [multivariable-RRQ4 vs. Q1 = 0.64 (95 % CI
  = 0.38–1.10; _p_ trend = .046)] and showed a marginally inverse association with
  ER+ PR+ tumors [RRper 100 g increment = 0.64 (95 % CI = 0.41–1.00)].
- In contrast, positive associations were seen between intake of total fruits and
  citrus fruits and breast cancer risk in overall and premenopausal women.
- However, these associations for fruit were all attenuated with additional adjustment
  for vitamin C intake.
- Our results suggest an overall null association between total fruit and vegetable
  intake and breast cancer risk.
- Intake of cruciferous vegetable showed a statistically significant association with
  a decreased risk of breast cancer among premenopausal women.
- In Japan, the incidence of breast cancer has continuously and steeply increased
  over the last three decades, and this cancer is currently the most common female
  cancer, as in Western countries [1].
- During this period, an approximately 20% reduction in the consumption of total fruits
  and vegetables has been reported [2].
- Fruit and vegetables are rich sources of various bioactive compounds and micronutrients,
  such as vitamins, phytoestrogens and carotenoids [3].
- These are potentially anticarcinogenic substances for which preventive effects against
  cancer have been proposed [4].
- A majority of epidemiological evidence does not support an overall preventive association
  [5, 6], however, and the latest report from the World Cancer Research Fund made
  no conclusion due to insufficient evidence [7].
- One explanation for the lack of any firm conclusion on the association of total
  fruits and vegetables on overall breast cancer risk might be the possible heterogeneity
  of impact on risk by sub-type of fruit or vegetable, or sub-type of breast tumor,
  such as estrogens—and/or progesterone receptor (ER/PR) status.
- For instance, mechanisms hypothesized to explain a putative decrease in risk by
  cruciferous vegetables include a hormone-related mechanism [8, 9], inhibition of
  cell growth, and induction of apoptosis [10].
- To date, the impact of consumption of total fruit and vegetables in consideration
  of estrogen and/or progesterone receptor (ER/PR) status has been reported by several
  studies [11, 12, 13, 14], as well as most recently in a large pooled analysis [15]
  of 20 cohort studies with the baseline data of the Japan Public Health Center-based
  Prospective Study (JPHC) [15].
- Although this pooled overall result showed a statistically significant inverse association
  between total vegetable consumption and ER-negative (−) breast cancer risk, the
  study-specific risk estimates in JPHC at the baseline survey suggested the opposite
  direction to that in the overall pooled result for 20 studies [15].
- However, the baseline survey of JPHC asked about information for four fruits and
  three vegetables and did not involve several commonly consumed vegetables in Japan,
  such as Japanese radish, Chinese cabbage, or Komatsuna.
- Further, in general, commonly consumed vegetables in Japan are not the same as those
  in Western countries [16].
- For example, the food supply in 2009 (capita/day) was 5 kcal for tomatoes, 11 for
  onions, and 57 for other vegetables in Japan, versus respective values of 21, 9,
  and 46 kcal.
- Here, we prospectively evaluated the impact of total and subgroup fruit and/or vegetable
  intake on the risk of breast cancer in consideration of ER/PR status among 47,289
  Japanese women using data from the 5-year follow-up survey of the JPHC with detailed
  dietary information.
- We also conducted secondary analyses to assess which specific vegetables contribute
  to the prevention of breast cancer.
- The study population of the JPHC study was defined as Japanese inhabitants of 11
  public health center (PHC) areas and consisted of two cohorts, with Cohort I launched
  in 1990 and Cohort II in 1993.
- Details of the study design have been described previously [17].
- The present study was approved by the institutional review board of the National
  Cancer Center, Tokyo, Japan.
- A total of 140,420 subjects were invited to participate in the baseline survey (1990–1994),
  of whom 71,698 were women.
- Subjects in the Tokyo-Katsushika PHC area (_n_ = 4,178) were excluded because complete
  information on cancer incidence were not available.
- Three self-reported questionnaires were sent, one each at baseline (response rate
  83 %), 5-year follow-up (1995–1998; response rate 79 %) and 10-year follow-up (2000–2003;
  response rate 77 %).
- The present analysis was conducted in 53,600 women who completed the 5-year follow-up
  survey questionnaire, which covered information on diet in greater detail than that
  at baseline.
- We excluded those who moved before the start of follow-up or who could not complete
  follow-up, as well as those with a self-reported history of cancer before the start
  of the follow-up (_n_ = 3,347).
- We also excluded women with missing data on total fruit or total vegetable intake,
  or with extreme total energy intake (±2SD) at the 5-year follow-up survey (_n_ =
  971).
- Consequently, 47,289 women were eligible for inclusion in the present analysis.
- Dietary assessment was done using a validated self-administered food frequency questionnaire
  (FFQ).
- The 5-year follow-up survey inquired about 138 food and beverage items [18, 19],
  including 16 fruits and 30 vegetables.
- We asked about the average frequency and portion size in the past year, with nine
  frequency categories ranging from _almost never_ to _7 or more times per day_.
- Standard portions/units were specified for each food item, with the three amount
  choices of small (50 % smaller than standard), medium (same as standard), and large
  (50 % larger).
- For seasonal fruit and vegetable products, we asked about the frequency of intake
  when in season and calculated the consumption (g/day) by taking account of seasonal
  length and portion size.
- The consumption of fruits and vegetables [grams per day (g/day)] as well as other
  estimated dietary/nutritional information was calculated with reference to the Standard
  Tables of Food Composition in Japan, Fifth Revised Edition [20].
- Items were classified into several sub-groups, including eight cruciferous vegetables
  (cabbage, Japanese radish, Chinese cabbage, Komatsuna, broccoli, leaf mustard, qing-geng-cai,
  and chard), five green vegetables (spinach, Chinese chives, mugwort, green pepper,
  and garland chrysanthemums), four carotenoid-rich yellow vegetables (carrots, pumpkins,
  tomatoes, and tomato juice), three tomato products (tomato, tomato juice, and ketchup)
  and two citrus fruits (mandarin oranges, other oranges).
- Nutritional covariates, except alcohol intake, were adjusted for total caloric intake
  using the residual method [21].
- Validity and reproducibility of the FFQ for dietary assessment has been evaluated
  [22, 23].
- Spearman correlation coefficients between the FFQ and 14- and 28-day dietary records
  as the objective standard were 0.25 for fruits and 0.34 for vegetables among 113
  women [22].
- Reproducibility was evaluated by administering two FFQs one year apart to 108 women,
  and showed Spearman correlation coefficients of 0.50 for fruits and of 0.53 for
  vegetables (energy-adjusted) [23].
- Information on other covariates, such as anthropometric and reproductive characteristics,
  smoking status and menopausal status, was also collected using the self-administered
  questionnaire at 5 years and updated in the analysis whenever reasonable information
  was available from the 10-year follow-up survey.
- Breast cancer cases were identified through active patient notification from major
  local hospitals in the study area and data linkage with population–based registries,
  with permission from the local governments responsible for the registries.
- Breast cancer cases were defined with reference to the Third Edition of the International
  Classification of Diseases for Oncology [24] as codes C500–509.
- Eight cases were identified by information on death certificates (i.e.
- Death Certificate Notification), of which five had no information on diagnosis (i.e.
- Death Certificate Only).
- Diagnosis was microscopically confirmed for 97 % of all cases.
- ER and PR status were evaluated by either immunohistochemical assay or enzyme-linked
  immunoassay.
- The cut-off point for a positive status for ER and PR was defined by clinical estimation
  for medical treatment or was specified by the assay method.
- Subjects were entered into the study on the administration date of the 5-year follow-up
  survey and contributed person-time from the 5-year follow-up survey to the date
  of diagnosis of cancer, date of death, date of migration out of the study area,
  or end of follow-up (31 December 2007), whichever occurred first.
- Dates of death were verified through linkage with the registration of deaths at
  the regional public health centers (PHCs) under the control of the Ministry of Health,
  Labour and Welfare.
- Dates of migration were verified through linkage with residential registries at
  the regional PHCs.
- We used multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models to estimate relative
  risks (RRs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) with age as a time scale [25].
- The proportional hazards assumptions were explored by Kaplan–Meier curves [26].
- Participants were subdivided into quartiles according to consumption of fruits and
  vegetables.
- The multivariable adjusted model included age, height (&lt;148, 148–151.9, 152–154.9,
  ≥155 cm), recent BMI (&lt;18.5, 18.5–23.9, ≥24, missing), BMI at age 20 years (&lt;20,
  20–23.9, ≥24), smoking status (never, ever), leisure-time physical activity (≤3
  days/month, 1–2 days/week, ≥3 days/week), age at menarche (≤13, 14, 15, ≥16 years,
  missing), age at first birth (nulliparous, &lt;26, ≥26 years, missing), parity (nulliparous,
  1–2, 3, ≥4 children, missing), age at menopause (premenopausal, ≤44, 45–54, ≥54
  years), use of exogenous female hormones (EFH) (ever, never), alcohol consumption
  (past drinkers, never-drinkers, occasional drinkers, drinkers ≤150 g ethanol/week,
  drinkers &gt;150 g ethanol/week), energy-adjusted intake of isoflavones (continuous),
  and use of vitamin C supplementation (user, non-user).
- 'We partly performed additional analyses with adjustment for energy-adjusted intake
  of vitamin C.


  We performed an overall analysis as well as stratified analyses by menopausal status
  (pre or post).'
- _p_ values for trend were tested by creating a continuous variable from the median
  value for each intake of exposure category, which was then included in the regression
  model.
- For the sub-analyses of ER/PR tumors, RRs were presented per 100-g increment in
  daily intake of each fruit or vegetable.
- All analyses were performed using the SAS Statistical Package Release 9.1 (SAS Institute,
  Cary, NC).
- All statistical tests were two-sided, and statistical significance was defined as
  _p_ &lt; 0.05.
- After an average of 10.2 years of follow-up, corresponding to 482,944 person-years,
  452 breast cancer cases were newly diagnosed among 47,289 women.
- Information on ER and PR status was available for 224 cases (50 % of total), of
  which 105 were ER+ PR+ (47 % of all ER/PR known cases), 51 were ER+ PR−, and 61
  were ER− PR−.
- The amount of total fruit consumed ranged from a mean value of 83 g/day in the lowest
  quartile to 444 g/day in the highest, while the amount of total vegetable intake
  ranged from a mean of 111 g/day in the lowest quartile to 384 g/day in the highest.
- 'The following food items made a major contribution: mandarin oranges (15.5 %),
  apples (6.2 %), Japanese radish (6.0 %), 100 percent apple juice (5.4 %), onions
  (5.2 %), 100 percent orange juice (5.0 %), carrots (4.7 %), cabbage (3.5 %), and
  100 percent tomato juice (3.2 %).'
- Women with high consumption of total fruits were more likely to be older, and have
  a low recent BMI, early menarche, low prevalence of EFH use, no tobacco use, low
  alcohol consumption, low total energy intake, and high isoflavone intake (Table
  1).
- Women with high consumption of total vegetables were more likely to be older, and
  have a high BMI, late menarche, more children, low tobacco use, low alcohol consumption,
  vitamin C supplementation, low total energy intake and high isoflavone intake compared
  to women with low consumption.
- We observed a modest positive correlation between fruit intake and vegetable intake
  (Spearman’s _r_ = 0.2).
- "Subject's characteristics at the study enrolment according to consumption of fruits

  \ \n\n\n\n\nFor total fruit and vegetable consumption, our results did not provide
  any substantial association with a decreased risk of breast cancer in this cohort
  [multivariable-adjusted RR Q4 vs. Q1 was 1.17 (95 % CI 0.89–1.53; _p_ trend = 0.14;
  Table 2)]."
- The corresponding result for total fruit intake was 1.35 (95 % CI 0.99–1.82; _p_
  trend = 0.051) and that for total vegetable intake was 1.02 (95 % CI 0.77–1.34;
  _p_ trend = 0.77).
- By sub-types of fruits and vegetables, we observed no associations for cruciferous
  vegetables, green-leaf vegetables, yellow vegetables, or tomato products in overall
  analysis.
- In contrast, we observed a positive association between citrus fruits intake and
  breast cancer risk [multivariable-adjusted RR Q4 vs. Q1 was 1.27 (95 % CI 0.95–1.70;
  _p_ trend = 0.044; Table 2)].
- However, the observed association was attenuated by adjustment for vitamin C [1.23(95
  % CI 0.87–1.75; _p_ trend = 0.093; Table 2)].

- However, the observed positive association between citrus fruit intake and breast
  cancer risk was attenuated by adjustment for vitamin C intake.
- Among postmenopausal women, we did not observe any association between any fruit
  or vegetable intake and breast cancer risk.
- In sub-analyses which considered the joint ER and PR status of breast tumors, intake
  of cruciferous vegetables showed a marginal inverse association with the development
  of ER+ PR+ tumors [age-area-adjusted RRper 100 g increment = 0.64 (95 % CI 0.41–1.00;
  _p_ = 0.051 (Table 4)], while intake of citrus fruits was positively associated
  with ER+ PR− tumors [RRper 100 g increment = 1.20 (95 % CI 1.01–1.42); Table 4).
- Total fruits, total vegetables, and all other subgroups of fruits and/or vegetables
  showed no association with a decreased risk of any ER/PR tumor subtype.
- "Age-area adjusted relative risks (RRs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) for

  proportional hazards models were adjusted for age time-scales and area (10)."
- 'Multivariable adjusted model was not applied due to the small number of cases by
  ER/PR tumors subtype


  Additional analyses for specific cruciferous vegetables showed that Japanese radish
  contributed to the inverse association among premenopausal women [age-area adjusted
  RR Q4 vs. Q1 was 0.50 (95 % CI 0.29–0.84; _p_ trend = 0.003; text only)].'
- The corresponding results by ER/PR tumor subtype were 0.28 (95 % CI 0.09–0.89; _p_
  trend = 0.02 for ER+ PR+ (28 cases) and 0.48 (95 % CI 0.09–2.71; _p_ trend = 0.15
  for ER− PR− (14 cases); text only).
- In this large prospective cohort study among Japanese women, our overall results
  suggested no substantial decrease in the risk of breast cancer with increased consumption
  of total fruits and vegetables.
- Our results did suggest a positive association of total fruit intake and citrus
  fruit intake with increased risk of breast cancer, particularly among premenopausal
  women, but these results were attenuated by adjustment for vitamin C intake.
- Further, we also observed a substantial preventive impact of cruciferous vegetables
  against breast cancer among premenopausal women, but no association between either
  total or any subgroup of fruit and vegetable intake and breast cancer risk among
  postmenopausal women.
- With regard to ER/PR breast tumors, intake of cruciferous vegetables, in particular
  Japanese radish, was substantially associated with a decreased risk of ER+ PR+ tumors.
- Our results also suggested a significant positive association between citrus fruit
  intake and the risk of ER+ PR− tumors.
- In contrast, no association with a decreased risk of any ER/PR tumor subtype was
  seen for total fruits, total vegetables, or any other subgroup of fruits and/or
  vegetables.
- Similar to our present results, previous pooled analyses have reported an overall
  null association for total fruit and vegetable consumption [5, 6].
- Median total fruit consumption (220 g/day) in the present study was within the range
  of median intake in one pooled analysis (164–355 g/day) [5], while median total
  vegetable intake (213 g/day) was within the range of median total vegetable intake
  (from 77 to 262 g/day) [5].
- To our knowledge, this study is the first large prospective study to investigate
  the association between the intake of fruits and/or vegetables and breast cancer
  risk with consideration of ER/PR subtype in a Japanese population alone.
- Unlike our present results, total vegetable intake was inversely associated with
  the risk of ER-negative (−) breast cancer risk in the pooled study [15].
- The pooled study did evaluate the intake of total or cruciferous vegetables and
  involved baseline data in the JPHC.
- However, this baseline data took into account only three vegetables and the study-specific
  risk estimates suggested the opposite direction against the pooled result for the
  20 studies [15].
- Further, the observed favorable impact we saw against ER+ PR+ tumors was attributable
  to the intake of cruciferous vegetables, in particular Japanese radish, which was
  not taken into account in the pooled study.
- Further, consistent with previous results [27], our results for a substantial preventive
  impact of cruciferous vegetables against overall and ER+ PR+ breast cancer was confined
  to premenopausal women, who had a higher level of endogenous female hormones than
  postmenopausal women.
- Cruciferous vegetables contain glucosinolates, which are hydrolysed to isothiocyanates
  and indoles.
- Experimental and epidemiological studies suggest their potential to decrease breast
  cancer risk by inhibiting cell growth, inducing apoptosis [10] and affecting hormonal
  level through the hormone- and/or ER-related mechanism [28–30].
- Our present results for ER+ PR+ tumors might support this hormone-related mechanism.
- Further epidemiological and experimental studies should be conducted in consideration
  of ER/PR status.
- With regard to citrus fruits intake, we unexpectedly observed a positive association
  between citrus fruit intake and risk of overall and ER+ PR− tumors.
- Previous studies had reported inverse associations for ER− [11], for ER+ [13], and
  for both ER+ PR+ and ER+ PR− [12].
- The results of sub-analyses for ER/PR tumors might be due to chance, because of
  the relatively small number of cases.
- For the overall results, however, a recent systematic review of five case–control
  studies [31] and a case–control study, the Shanghai Breast Cancer Study [32], also
  reported an inverse association between citrus fruits intake and breast cancer risk.
- Unlike these studies, our results showed a positive association overall.
- The quantity of citrus fruits intake in the highest quartile (Q4) was 188.5 g/day
  (median) in our study, while that in the highest quintile (Q5) of the Shanghai study
  was 30.4 g/day.
- Our data suggest that citrus fruits intake is correlated with vitamin C intake and
  that women taking supplemental vitamin C had a substantially higher risk than women
  who did not.
- Given these results, the association between citrus fruits intake and breast cancer
  risk might be explained by a U- or J- shaped relationship.
- That is, the appropriate amount of citrus fruits intake leads to risk reduction,
  while an extremely high intake might lead to an increased risk of breast cancer
  due to the extremely high dose of vitamin C. The dose-response impact of vitamin
  C on the development of breast cancer requires further research.
- The strength of our study is its large sample size and prospective population-based
  cohort design.
- Exposure information was collected before diagnosis, ruling out the possibility
  of differential recall bias.
- Misclassification of disease was also unlikely due to the low percentages of DCN
  and DCO.
- Given the reasonable validity of fruit and vegetable intake, as measured by Spearman
  correlation coefficients between the FFQ and DR [33], as well as the consistency
  of the null results in the present and previous studies, the overall null association
  for total fruits and vegetables might be factual.
- Several limitations should also be noted.
- One limitation is the small number of cases after stratification by tumor subtype
  and/or menopausal status.
- The lack of statistical power should be considered when interpreting the results.
- Dietary and other epidemiological information were assessed based on self-reported
  questionnaires, and measurement error was accordingly unavoidable.
- Although the FFQ-based fruits/vegetables intake was calculated using a purpose-developed
  database [34], some degree of seasonal, geographical and cultivational variation
  in micronutrient contents in food products might not be completely ruled out [35].
- Our observed null association might be attributable to non-differential misclassification
  of exposure in prospective study design.
- The possibility of uncontrolled confounding and statistical chance finding due to
  multiple testing should also be considered.
- In summary, our results do not support that the risk of breast cancer is decreased
  with increased consumption of total or any other subgroup of fruits and vegetables.
- For premenopausal women, however, our results suggest a substantial preventive association
  between cruciferous vegetable intake and breast cancer risk.
