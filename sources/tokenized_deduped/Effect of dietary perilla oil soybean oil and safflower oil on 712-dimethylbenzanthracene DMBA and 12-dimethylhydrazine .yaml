- The effects of diet supplemented with perilla oil, which contains a large amount
  of n-3 alpha-linolenic acid, and n-6 linoleic acid rich soybean and safflower oil
  supplemented diets on 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA)- and 1,2-dimethylhydrazine
  (DMH)-induced mammary gland and colon carcinogenesis were investigated in female
  SD rats.
- Groups of 23 or 24, 5 week old animals were first given three s.c. injections of
  40 mg/kg body wt DMH followed by a single intragastric administration of 50 mg/kg
  body wt DMBA within 2 weeks of the commencement.
- Starting 1 week after the DMBA treatment, they were administered pellet diet containing
  10% perilla oil, soybean oil or safflower oil for the succeeding 33 weeks.
- Histological examination revealed that the resultant numbers of mammary tumors per
  rat were significantly lower in rats given perilla oil diet (4.4 +/- 2.5) than in
  the soybean oil diet group (6.5 +/- 3.9).
- Furthermore, colon tumor incidence was significantly lower in animals receiving
  the perilla oil supplement (18.2%) than in those given safflower oil diet (47.4%),
  and the numbers of colon tumors per rat tended to be lowest in rats administered
  perilla oil.
- Also the incidence of nephroblastomas in rats receiving perilla oil diet (0%) was
  significantly lower than that for the soybean oil diet group (23.8%).
- The results thus indicate that the alpha-linolenic acid (n-3)-rich perilla oil diet
  inhibits development of mammary gland, colon and kidney tumors as compared to linoleic
  acid (n-6)-rich safflower or soybean oil diet.
