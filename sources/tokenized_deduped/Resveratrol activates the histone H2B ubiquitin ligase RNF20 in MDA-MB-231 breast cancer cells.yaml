- Resveratrol, a polyphenolic compound found in grapes, has been shown to partially
  exert its anti-cancer function through the modulation of epigenetic events.
- However, the epigenetic targets of resveratrol in breast cancer are not yet fully
  understood.
- Here, we identified that the gene encoding the histone H2B ubiquitin ligase RNF20
  (ring finger protein 20), a chromatin modifying enzyme and putative tumour suppressor,
  is up-regulated by resveratrol in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells.
- Up-regulation of _RNF20_ is achieved through an increase of active histone marks
  around its promoter.
- The increase in _RNF20_ in MDA-MB-231 likely contributes to _p21_ regulation and
  the anti-growth effects of resveratrol, as _RNF20_ knockdown diminished these effects.
- Our findings suggest that RNF20 is a novel epigenetic target of resveratrol, and
  increase our understanding of how it contributes to the chemopreventive effect of
  resveratrol in a more aggressive breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231.
