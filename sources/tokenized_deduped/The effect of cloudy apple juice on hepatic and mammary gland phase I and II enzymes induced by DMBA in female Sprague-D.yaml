- Apples abundant in phenolic compounds show a variety of biological activities that
  may contribute to health beneficial effects against cardiovascular diseases, diabetes,
  obesity and cancer.
- We investigated the effect of cloudy apple juice (CAJ) on the hepatic and mammary
  gland carcinogen metabolizing enzymes, DNA damage and liver injury, altered by 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene
  (DMBA).
- Sprague-Dawley female rats were gavaged with CAJ (10 ml/kg b.w.)
- for 28 consecutive days.
- DMBA was administered i.p.
- on the 27th and the 28th days.
- In the liver, feeding with CAJ decreased the activities of CYP1A1 and 1A2 and increased
  phase II enzymes.
- The activities of all enzymes tested were enhanced in the animals treated with DMBA
  alone and in combination with CAJ.
- The most significant changes in the level of the hepatic enzymes tested were observed
  for GST alpha and NQO1.
- In mammary gland CAJ induced an increase in the level of GST mu and GST pi, while
  DMBA and CAJ combined administration elevated GST pi only.
- This may be beneficial as GST pi is involved in the DMBA detoxification.
- Additionally, pretreatment with CAJ reduced the level of most of the blood biochemical
  liver and kidney markers elevated as a result of DMBA treatment.
- These findings indicate that CAJ may interfere with enzyme system involved in carcinogen
  metabolism.
- However, this effect seems to be dependent on tissue and carcinogen and is moderately
  effective in the case of DMBA_._ Moreover, CAJ can also provide some protection
  against the liver and kidney damage.
