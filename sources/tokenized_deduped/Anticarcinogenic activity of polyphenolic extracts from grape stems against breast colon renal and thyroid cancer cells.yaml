- A major part of the wineries' wastes is composed of grape stems which are discarded
  mainly in open fields and cause environmental problems due mainly to their high
  polyphenolic content.
- The grape stem extracts' use as a source of high added value polyphenols presents
  great interest because this combines a profitable venture with environmental protection
  close to wine-producing zones.
- In the present study, at first, the Total Polyphenolic Content (TPC) and the polyphenolic
  composition of grape stem extracts from four different Greek _Vitis vinifera_ varieties
  were determined by HPLC methods.
- Afterwards, the grape stem extracts were examined for their ability to inhibit growth
  of colon (HT29), breast (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-23), renal (786-0 and Caki-1) and thyroid
  (K1) cancer cells.
- The cancer cells were exposed to the extracts for 72 h and the effects on cell growth
  were evaluated using the SRB assay.
- The results indicated that all extracts inhibited cell proliferation, with IC50
  values of 121-230 Î¼g/ml (MCF-7), 121-184 Î¼g/ml (MDA-MD-23), 175-309 Î¼g/ml (HT29),
  159-314 Î¼g/ml (K1), 180-225 Î¼g/ml (786-0) and 134-&gt;400 Î¼g/ml (Caki-1).
- This is the first study presenting the inhibitory activity of grape stem extracts
  against growth of colon, breast, renal and thyroid cancer cells.
