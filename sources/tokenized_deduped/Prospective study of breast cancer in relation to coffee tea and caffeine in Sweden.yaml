- Studies of coffee and tea consumption and caffeine intake as risk factors for breast
  cancer are inconclusive.
- We assessed coffee and tea consumption, caffeine intake, and possible confounding
  factors among 42,099 women from the Swedish Women's Lifestyle and Health study,
  the participants of which were aged 30-49 years at enrollment in 1991-1992\.
- Complete follow-up for breast cancer incidence was performed through 2012 _via_
  linkage to national registries.
- Poisson regression models were used to estimate relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence
  intervals (CIs) for breast cancer.
- During follow-up 1,395 breast cancers were diagnosed.
- The RR was 0.97 (95% CI 0.94-0.99) for a 1-unit increase in cups of coffee/day,
  1.14 (95% CI 1.05-1.24) for a 1-unit increase in cups of tea/day, and 0.97 (95%
  CI 0.95-1.00) for a 100 mg/day increase in caffeine intake.
- 'Although the RR for no consumption (RR = 0.86, 95% CI 0.69-1.08), a group with
  a relatively small number of women, was not statistically significant, women with
  higher consumption had a decreased breast cancer risk (3-4 cups/day: RR = 0.87,
  95% CI 0.76-1.00; ≥5 cups/day: RR = 0.81, 95% CI 0.70-0.94) compared to women consuming
  1-2 cups of coffee/day.'
- Compared to no consumption, women consuming &gt;1 cups tea/day showed an increased
  breast cancer risk (RR = 1.19, 95% CI 1.00-1.42).
- Similar patterns of estimates were observed for breast cancer risk overall, during
  pre- and postmenopausal years, and for ER+ or PR+ breast cancer, but not for ER−
  and PR− breast cancer.
- Our findings suggest that coffee consumption and caffeine intake is negatively associated
  with the risk of overall and ER+/PR− breast cancer, and tea consumption is positively
  associated with the risk of overall and ER+/PR+ breast cancer.
- After water, coffee and tea are the most commonly consumed beverages in the world.
- Coffee consumption is especially high in Northern Europe and North America.
- Black tea consumption is predominant in Northern Europe, North America, and Western
  Asia, while green tea consumption is more popular in Eastern Asia.
- Moreover, a great variety of herbal infusions, such as mate, a traditional hot drink
  in parts of South America, also contain caffeine, a chemical substance present in
  coffee and tea.
- Hence, any causal association between the consumption of these beverages and breast
  cancer could have major public health implications.
- There are several plausible mechanisms by which coffee, tea, and caffeine may affect
  breast cancer risk.
- Coffee and tea contain a wide variety of phytochemicals, many of which are antioxidants,[1]
  and coffee compounds such as caffeine, chlorogenic acid, kahweol, and cafestol have
  known biologic effects.
- '[2] Coffee may inhibit DNA methylation,[3] influence tumor differentiation,[4]
  and alter sex hormone levels.'
- '[5] Theaflavins and thearubigins, the oxidized derivatives of black tea catechins,
  may enhance apoptosis, suppress cell proliferation, and inhibit angiogenesis, although
  black tea polyphenols have low or no bioavailability.'
- '[6] Caffeine is present in both coffee and tea, and has been positively correlated
  with sex hormone binding globulin levels, a direct determinant of bioavailable estradiol
  among both pre- and postmenopausal women.'
- '[5]


  Although a number of epidemiologic studies have analyzed coffee and/or tea consumption
  and the risk of breast cancer, so far the results have been inconclusive.'
- Some studies showed an inverse association,[7-9] particularly for subgroups of estrogen
  receptor (ER)-negative cancers,[10] BRCA1 mutation carriers[11] and postmenopausal
  women,[11] while most cohort studies found no association between the risk of breast
  cancer overall and coffee consumption,[12-20] tea consumption[12-14, 16, 17, 19]
  or caffeine intake.
- '[15-17, 19]


  We investigated whether coffee consumption, tea consumption, and caffeine intake
  is associated with breast cancer overall, by menopausal status, or ER and progesterone
  receptor (PR) status, in the Swedish Women''s Lifestyle and Health (WLH) study.'
- The Swedish WLH study cohort and exposure assessments have been previously described
  in detail.
- '[21] Briefly, the source population of this study was women aged 30-49 years residing
  in the Uppsala Health Care Region in Sweden between 1991 and 1992.'
- A random sample of the source population was asked to complete a postal questionnaire,
  which contained a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ); 49,259 women returned the
  questionnaire and were enrolled in the study.
- 'We excluded 7,160 (15%) women: 2,981 with any cancer before cohort enrollment;
  934 with energy intakes outside the 1st (1,847 kJ/day) and 99th (12,474 kJ/day)
  percentiles; 41 who had emigrated; and 3,204 with missing values on exposure variables.'
- Thus 42,099 women were included in the present analyses.
- The Swedish Data Inspection Board, the Regional Ethical Committee of Uppsala University,
  and the Ethical Committee of the Karolinska Institutet approved the study.
- Consent was assumed by the return of the postal questionnaire.
- Coffee consumption during the preceding year was assessed in an open-ended question
  asking how many cups of coffee per day or per week women consumed on average.
- One cup of coffee was estimated to contain 150 ml.
- Tea consumption during the preceding year was not assessed in cups per day.
- Instead, participants reported the frequency of their consumption using nine pre-specified
  frequencies (ranging from never or seldom, to three times per day), and the portion
  size (small, medium, or large; _i.e.,_ 0.5, 1, or 1.5 cups), with one cup of tea
  estimated to contain 200 ml.
- We then translated this information into cups per day.
- A previous validation study of a similar FFQ was conducted among Swedish women.
- It showed the FFQ to be a valid instrument to measure coffee and tea consumption
  compared with four 7-day dietary records collected during different seasons.
- Moreover, it showed that the FFQ was reproducible at two separate administrations
  conducted at a 1-year interval.
- '[22]


  Caffeine intake (mg/day) was calculated based on the sum of the estimated amounts
  of caffeine in the coffee and tea consumed.'
- The present analyses considered set values of 69 mg of caffeine per 100 ml of coffee
  and 25 mg of caffeine per 100 ml of tea based on a research report published by
  the Nordic Council of Ministers, which comprehensively reviewed studies on caffeine,
  caffeine intake, and health results.
- '[23] In the report, the mean value of caffeine content was 103 mg in a 150 ml cup
  of filtered coffee and 38 mg in a 150 ml cup of tea.'
- We collected no information on other caffeine-containing foods, beverages, or drugs.
- The cohort was followed from 1992 until 31 December 2012 through linkage with the
  Swedish Cancer Registry, Mortality Registry, and Population Registry (which records
  migrations).
- Follow-up time was calculated from the date of entry into the Swedish WLH study
  until the occurrence of breast cancer, death, or the end of the observation period,
  whichever came first.
- Our outcome was defined as a diagnosis of invasive breast cancer (International
  Classification of Diseases, 7th Revision code 170.0).
- Information on hormone receptor status was extracted from the Uppsala Regional Cancer
  Registry, which covers the source population.
- During follow-up, 158 participants had a diagnosis of breast cancer in the Swedish
  Cancer Registry that was not recorded in the Uppsala Regional Cancer Registry, as
  the participant no longer lived in the region at the time of breast cancer diagnosis.
- ER and PR status was evaluated by Abbott immunoassay until 1997 and by an immunohistochemical
  method thereafter.
- Cases with ≥0.1 fmol/µg cytosol DNA by Abbott immunoassay were considered hormone
  receptor-positive.
- By the immunohistochemical method, cases were considered hormone receptor-positive
  when the percentage of positive cells was ≥10%, and hormone receptor-negative when
  the percentage of positive cells was &lt;10%.
- Age at menopause was obtained by combining information from the baseline questionnaire
  and a follow-up questionnaire conducted in 2002-2003 (available for 29,867 women
  only).
- Women without information on age at menopause were considered postmenopausal at
  age 53, which corresponds to the 75th percentile of age at menopause in the study
  sample.
- Using Poisson regression, we estimated relative risks (RRs) and two-sided 95% Wald
  confidence intervals (CIs) of breast cancer according to different exposures.
- We fitted regression models by splitting the follow-up time (attained age between
  cohort entry and cohort exit) into 1-year intervals.
- Poisson regression gives approximately the same parameter estimates and likelihood
  ratios as Cox proportional hazards regression when the length of follow-up is split
  into finer intervals, but allows for greater flexibility in the modeling.
- '[24] The three primary exposures, coffee consumption, tea consumption, and caffeine
  intake, were evaluated separately and were considered both continuously (cups of
  coffee/day, cups of tea/day, and mg caffeine/day) and categorically (0, 1-2, 3-4,
  ≥5 cups of coffee/day; 0, 1, &gt;1 cups of tea/day; and tertiles of mg caffeine/day).'
- Associations between breast cancer incidence and coffee consumption, tea consumption,
  and caffeine intake were examined considering all participants, as well as premenopausal
  and postmenopausal years separately.
- We also examined associations stratified by hormone receptor status.
- 'When estimating the RRs of coffee and tea consumption, and caffeine intake, we
  adjusted for the following confounding factors: age, body mass index (BMI, weight
  in kg divided by height in m2 as a continuous variable and categorized as &lt;18.5,
  18.5-24.9, 25-29.9, ≥30), duration of breastfeeding (months), and alcohol consumption
  (g/day, categorized as 0, 0-24, &gt;24).'
- These confounding factors were selected _a priori_ due to their effect on the risk
  of breast cancer and their potential association with coffee consumption and tea
  consumption.
- We fitted models both with and without adjustment for the confounding factors.
- In a sensitivity analysis we fitted a model that also adjusted for smoking status,
  education, and physical activity.
- The effect of age on breast cancer was modeled with a cubic spline function.
- The SAS software (proc glimmix, SAS Institute, Cary, NC) version 9.4 was used for
  the statistical analyses.
- During the 856,529 person-years of follow-up, 1,395 breast cancer cases (847 ER+/PR+,
  194 ER+/PR−, 26 ER−/PR+, 170 ER−/PR−, and 158 with no information on ER/PR status)
  were diagnosed.
- Table 1 shows coffee consumption, tea consumption, and caffeine intake according
  to the general characteristics of the study sample.
- More than two-thirds (70%) of study women drank ≥3 or more cups of coffee/day, while
  most women (86%) drank ≤1 cup of tea/day.
- The more coffee women consumed, the higher their caffeine intake.
- However, the more tea women drank, the lower their coffee consumption, which thereby
  lowered their caffeine intake.
- General study characteristics were similar among women with different levels of
  coffee consumption, tea consumption, and caffeine intake (Table 1).
- Of all caffeine intake, 7% came from tea consumption, and 93% from coffee consumption
  (data not shown).
- Table 2 shows the RRs of breast cancer according to daily coffee consumption and
  tea consumption based on number of cups, and caffeine intake as a continuous variable.
- The multivariable RRs for a 1-unit increase in cups of coffee/day were 0.97 (95%
  CI 0.94-0.99), 1.14 (95% CI 1.05-1.24) for cups of tea/day, and 0.97 (95% CI 0.95-1.00)
  for a 100 mg increase in caffeine intake.
- Similar estimates were observed during postmenopausal years, but risk estimates
  were not statistically significant during premenopausal years.
- An increased RR of ER+/PR+ breast cancer was observed for a 1-unit increase in cups
  of tea/day (RR 1.21, 95% CI 1.09-1.34), whereas decreased RRs of ER+/PR− breast
  cancer were observed for a 1-unit increase in cups of coffee/day (RR 0.92, 95% CI
  0.85-0.99) and for a 100 mg increase in caffeine intake (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.86-0.98)
  (Table 2).
- The estimated RRs remained unchanged in models that also adjusted for smoking status,
  education, and physical activity (Supporting Information Table 2).
- Table 3 shows the RRs of breast cancer according to daily coffee consumption, tea
  consumption, and caffeine intake overall and by menopausal status.
- When considering statistical power, coffee consumption of 1-2 cups/day, instead
  of no consumption, was used as a reference category.
- Compared to women consuming 1-2 cups of coffee per day, women who consumed ≥3 cups
  of coffee/day had a decreased risk of breast cancer (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.76-1.00 for
  3-4 cups; RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.70-0.94 for ≥5 cups), but this was not observed for
  no consumption (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.69-1.08).
- Compared to no consumption, an increased risk of breast cancer with tea consumption
  was observed for &gt;1 cup of tea/day (RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.00-1.42).
- The RR for the 3rd tertile relative to the 1st tertile of caffeine intake was 0.86
  (95% CI 0.76-0.99).
- A decreased RR for high coffee consumption and an increased RR for tea consumption
  were observed during postmenopausal years but not premenopausal years (Table 3).
- Table 4 shows the RR of breast cancer according to coffee consumption, tea consumption,
  and caffeine intake by hormone receptor status.
- A decreased risk of ER+/PR− breast cancer was observed among women who consumed
  ≥3 cups of coffee/day (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.48-0.94 for 3-4 cups; RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.36-0.76
  for ≥5 cups, compared to 1-2 cups).
- Compared with no consumption, increased risks of ER+/PR+ breast cancer were observed
  with tea consumption (RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.00-1.38 for 1 cup; RR 1.38, 95% CI 1.11-1.71
  for &gt;1 cups).
- A decreased risk of ER+/PR− breast cancer was observed with high caffeine intake
  (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.45-0.92 for the 3rd tertile compared to the 1st tertile) (Table
  4).
- In this large prospective study with a broad variation in coffee consumption, we
  found a statistically significant decreasing trend of breast cancer overall with
  increasing coffee consumption and caffeine intake.
- We also found a positive association between tea consumption and breast cancer overall.
- Our findings were quantitatively similar in pre- and postmenopausal years.
- The mechanisms responsible for the chemopreventive effects of coffee are not fully
  understood.
- Known coffee constituents include caffeine, diterpenes, phenolic acids, melanoidins,
  _N_-methylpyridinium, and acrylamide, which are produced during the roasting of
  coffee beans.
- The major polyphenols in coffee are chlorogenic acids and metabolites, including
  quinic acid, caffeic acid, ferulic acid, and coumaric acid.
- Coffee could reduce reactive oxygen species by a direct antioxidant effect.
- Potential mechanisms for a chemopreventive effect of coffee involve the regulation
  of DNA repair genes and genes involved in the detoxification processes, as well
  as the processes of inflammation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and metastasis.
- '[2] Coffee consumption has been inversely associated with circulating markers of
  inflammation and insulin resistance,[25, 26] both of which may play a role in breast
  cancer.'
- '[27, 28] _In vitro_ studies found that coffee reduced the phase II enzyme, estrogen
  sulfotransferases (SULT1E1) gene expression in Caco-2 cells.'
- Because sulfation is the major pathway involved in the inactivation of estrogens,
  the effect on SULT1E1 may enhance estrogen activity and thereby explain why the
  inverse association between coffee and cancer risk is more evident among subgroups
  of postmenopausal women for some cancers.
- '[29]


  A number of epidemiologic studies have estimated the association between coffee
  consumption and the risk of breast cancer, but the results were inconclusive.'
- Several case-control studies suggested an inverse association between heavy coffee
  consumption (≥5 cups/day) and ER- breast cancer among postmenopausal women[7, 30]
  or premenopausal women.
- '[31] However, most cohort studies found no association between the risk of breast
  cancer and coffee consumption,[12-20, 32] nor in subgroups of hormone receptor-positive
  and -negative breast cancers,[18, 19, 32, 33] pre- and postmenopausal women,[19,
  32] or women drinking caffeinated _versus_ decaffeinated coffee.'
- '[15, 18, 19, 32] A cohort study in Sweden[20] showed a reduced risk of breast cancer
  with boiled coffee consumption, a brewing method now limited primarily to rural
  areas of northern Sweden, but not with filtered coffee consumption, which is the
  most popular type of coffee in Sweden.'
- 'Brewing method has little effect on the caffeine and polyphenol levels in coffee,
  but is a major determinant of the diterpene level: diterpene concentration is high
  in boiled coffee and very low in filtered coffee.'
- '[34] Coffee contains two specific diterpenes, cafestol and kahweol, which produce
  biologic-effects compatible with anticarcinogenic properties, including the induction
  of phase II enzymes involved in carcinogen detoxification,[35, 36] specific inhibition
  of the phase I enzyme activity responsible for carcinogen activation, and stimulation
  of intracellular antioxidant defense mechanisms.'
- '[37] Kahweol is an antitumor compound with inhibitory effects on tumor cell growth
  and survival, especially against MDA-MB231 breast cancer cells.'
- '[38]


  In two meta-analyses, a weak or borderline inverse association was observed between
  coffee consumption and the risk of breast cancer overall.'
- '[8, 9] Two other meta-analyses showed no association between the risk of breast
  cancer overall and coffee consumption, but showed statistically significant inverse
  associations for postmenopausal women, for BRCA1 mutation carriers,[11] and for
  ER− breast cancer.'
- '[10]


  Tea extracts, especially those of green tea, and tea polyphenols have been shown
  to inhibit the formation and development of tumors in different organs in animal
  models.'
- '[6] There is considerable evidence that tea polyphenols, in particular (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate
  (EGCG), inhibit enzyme activities and signal transduction pathways, resulting in
  the suppression of cell proliferation and the enhancement of apoptosis, as well
  as the inhibition of cell invasion, angiogenesis, and metastasis.'
- '[6] Cancer risk reduction is observed more frequently in studies on green tea than
  in those on black tea, which is probably because many polyphenols in black tea are
  poorly bioavailable, or not bioavailable due to fermentation.'
- As a chemical, EGCG can exert its actions in the form of an antioxidant or a pro-oxidant.
- It can also bind to target molecules and trigger cascades of signalling or metabolic
  pathways that lead to the inhibition of carcinogenesis.
- The antioxidative activity of tea polyphenols could decrease oxidative DNA damage,
  which has been shown in both human and animal models.
- '[6, 39]


  Laboratory studies have presented strong evidence for cancer-preventive properties
  in tea constituents,[6, 40] but results from epidemiologic studies are inconclusive.'
- Only one cohort study in Sweden found an association between tea consumption and
  increased risk of breast cancer overall (comparing ≥2 cups/day with no consumption,
  adjusted RR 1.22, 95% CI 1.05-1.42) and in ER+/PR+ tumors (adjusted RR 1.36, 95%
  CI 1.09-1.36),[33] which is similar to the result in the present study, while the
  other case-control[41, 42] and cohort studies[12-17, 19, 32, 43-49] found no association.
- The two most updated meta-analyses,[42, 50] which included up to 25 studies on black
  tea consumption, showed no association between black tea consumption and breast
  cancer overall or in subgroups by study design, geographic- region-, menopausal
  status, hormone receptor status, or BMI, while two other meta-analyses[51, 52] showed
  a modest increase in the risk of breast cancer with black tea consumption.
- Caffeine, a natural purine alkaloid, is one of the main constituents of coffee and
  tea.
- The mechanisms by which caffeine may affect breast carcinogenesis are complex and
  remain unclear.
- Caffeine has been reported to suppress cell cycle and proliferation and to induce
  apoptosis.
- '[53] Caffeine has also been positively associated with blood levels of estrone[54]
  and sex hormone-binding globulin,[54-56] but negatively associated with plasma-free
  estradiol.'
- '[56]


  In a prospective cohort in the United States (_i.e.,_ The Women''s Health Study),
  which assessed caffeine intake from coffee, tea, cola, and chocolate, caffeine intake
  was positively associated with the risk of ER−/PR− breast cancer (RR = 1.68; 95%
  CI 1.01-2.81, for the highest quintile of intake compare to the lowest) and breast
  tumors &gt;2 cm, whereas no significant association was reported between caffeine
  intake and ER+/PR+ or ER+/PR− breast cancer.'
- '[15] In another cohort study in the United States (_i.e.,_ The Nurses'' Health
  Study), which assessed caffeine intake from caffeine-containing beverages and chocolate,
  an inverse association of caffeine intake with breast cancer was observed among
  postmenopausal women (RR = 0.88; 95% CI 0.79-0.97, for the highest quintile of intake
  compared to the lowest).'
- '[13] On the other hand, other cohort studies in Sweden,[16] France,[19] and the
  United States[32, 57] found no association between caffeine and breast cancer according
  to hormone receptor status[19, 32] or BMI.'
- '[16]


  The strengths of our study include the population-based prospective design of the
  Swedish WLH study, and the complete follow-up with regard to breast cancer incidence.'
- We also assessed coffee and tea consumption in great detail and had an unusually
  informative, wide range of exposures to coffee.
- While most other studies analyzed postmenopausal women, we were able to address
  the topic in a large population of premenopausal women (40% of breast cancer cases).
- But our study also has limitations.
- The women in our cohort were aged 30-49 years at enrollment in 1991-1992, thus their
  responses in the questionnaire reflect mainly coffee consumption, tea consumption,
  and caffeine intake at premenopausal ages.
- Moreover, coffee consumption and tea consumption were only assessed at enrollment.
- This may attenuate our associations if women changed their coffee and tea habits
  during follow-up.
- Cumulative coffee/tea consumption was not measurable as duration before enrollment,
  and was not assessed during follow-up.
- However, coffee and tea drinking habits in the Swedish population are often established
  in young adulthood and remain similar at least between 30 and 60 years of age.
- '[23] Based on an analysis of Swedish participants with repeated health surveys
  10 years apart, coffee drinking habits tend to remain stable over a long period
  of time.'
- '[58]


  Misclassification of coffee and tea consumption due to measurement error associated
  with the FFQ certainly occurred in our study, but given the prospective study design
  this misclassification was likely non-differential.'
- Measurement error with FFQs is likely to be greater than that with other methods,
  such as 24-hr recalls and diet diaries, and false-negative results have been suggested
  in studies of diet-disease associations.
- '[59, 60] Even though the substantial limitations of FFQs have been known for some
  time, they remain a standard tool for dietary assessment in large studies, as they
  are relatively simple and inexpensive compared to other instruments; investigators
  who conduct large-scale epidemiological studies find such questionnaires particularly
  attractive.'
- A validation study among Swedish women showed that their FFQ, which was similar
  to that used in the present study, was a valid instrument to measure coffee and
  tea consumption (Pearson correlation coefficients = 0.61 and 0.71 for coffee and
  tea, respectively) when it was compared with four 7-day dietary records collected
  during different seasons.
- 'They also found that results were reproducible (Pearson correlation coefficients:
  0.69 and 0.77 for coffee and tea, respectively) between FFQ1 and FFQ2, which were
  conducted at a 1-year interval.'
- '[22] Studies on reproducibility and validity have concluded that coffee and tea
  are among the more accurately reported foods in FFQs.'
- '[61, 62]


  Total caffeine intake may differ considerably among individuals depending on their
  source of caffeine, caffeine concentration in these sources, and, for coffee and
  tea, brewing time and brewing method.'
- '[23] Caffeine-containing drugs, foods, and beverages other than coffee and tea
  were not included in total caffeine intake in this study, and thus the mean caffeine
  intake might be underestimated.'
- Misclassification of menopausal status due to imputation for women without information
  on age at menopause may also have occurred in our study, but this misclassification
  was likely also non-differential and was of limited concern because we found no
  evidence of heterogeneity by menopausal status.
- Lastly, our study included many statistical tests, each on the 5% level, and therefore
  a few statistically significant findings can be expected by chance alone.
- In conclusion, our findings suggest that coffee consumption and caffeine intake
  is negatively associated with the risk of breast cancer overall and ER+/PR− breast
  cancer, respectively, and tea consumption may be positively associated with risk
  of breast cancer overall and ER+/PR+ breast cancer.
- Our findings provide additional evidence to support the role of coffee in cancer
  prevention.
- More detailed mechanism studies are needed to verify the effects of coffee/tea/caffeine
  in breast cancer.
- The roles and mechanisms of coffee/tea/caffeine in breast cancers with different
  hormone receptor statuses need to be examined in future studies.
