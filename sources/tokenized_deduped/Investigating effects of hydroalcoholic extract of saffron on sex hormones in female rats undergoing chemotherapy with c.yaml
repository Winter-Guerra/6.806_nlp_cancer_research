- Cyclophosphamide is an antineoplastic medicine that causes disorder in functions
  of the body systems.
- Thus, the purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of hydroalcoholic extract
  of saffron on improving the complications of cyclophosphamide on sex hormones.
- Fifty-six adult female Wistar rats were randomly divided into seven groups; control,
  sham (received distilled water, solvent extract, and drug), experimental groups
  1, 2, and 3 (received cyclophosphamide (5 mg/kg/bw) + hydroalcoholic extract of
  saffron (2, 1, and 0.5 g/kg/bw), experimental group 4 (saffron 2 g/kg/bw), and experimental
  group 5 (cyclophosphamide 5 mg/kg/bw).
- Cyclophosphamide was given intraperitoneally, and extract by gavage was prescribed
  for 21 days.
- At the end of the experiment, after blood and preparation of serum, ELISA method
  was used for measuring the estrogen, progesterone, FSH, and LH hormones.
- Data and LSD test were analyzed with SPSS software (version 18).
- Results show that the concurrent use of low-dose cyclophosphamide and saffron extract
  can reduce toxic effect of cyclophosphamide on pituitary-gonadal axis and cause
  estrogen to be produced.
- Cyclophosphamide is a major component of many effective drug compounds (Bokser et
  al.
- 1990).
- Hence, it is widely used as an antineoplastic medicine for treatment of diseases
  such as malignant lymphoma, leukemia, neuroblastoma, and autoimmune diseases (Dollery
  1999).
- Despite the numerous clinical applications, this drug does have adverse effects,
  such as reproductive toxicity in humans and laboratory animals who are exposed to
  it (Anderson et al.
- 1995), as well as the reduction and degeneration of ovarian follicles (Higuchi et
  al.
- 1995; Sampa et al.
- 2001).
- Cyclophosphamide causes delete sperm (Masala et al.
- 1997) as well as biochemical and histological changes in testis and epididymis of
  rats and humans (Reichman and Green 1994).
- The mechanism of drug effect is due to the connection between the two strands of
  DNA molecule, and the break in DNA and RNA also inhibits protein synthesis (Hemminki
  and Kallama 1986).
- Chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide in patients with breast cancer and those who
  have as yet never experienced menstruation may suffer from chemical sterility and,
  in treatment of women with systemic lupus, this drug causes premature menstruation
  (McDermott and Powell 1996).
- Biological compounds with antioxidant properties can protect cells and tissues against
  disturbances caused by reactive oxygen species and free radicals (Das 2002; Ghosh
  et al.
- 2002).
- Due to its various health benefits in traditional medicine, saffron has been the
  focus of much attention as a medicinal herb in the recent decades (EbrahimZade et
  al.
- 2007; Kafi 2003).
- Saffron, with the scientific name (_Crocus sativus_ L.) is from the lily race (Iridaceae),
  the main ingredients of which include crocin, crocetin, and saffranal (Zargari 1997).
- It has also been reported to have anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anticancer
  properties (Abdullaer et al.
- 2004; Ochiai et al.
- 2004).
- Premkumar and colleagues (2006) reported that saffron prevented DNA damage of bone
  marrow cells in laboratory mice due to antitumor drug consumption named sin platinum,
  cyclophosphamide, and mitomycin (Premkumar and Thirunavukkarasu 2006).
- So based on the abovementioned information, the objective of this study is to investigate
  the effect of saffron hydroalcoholic extract on improving complications due to cyclophosphamide
  on sex hormones rate in female rats.
- This is an experimental study.
- In this research, 56 adult female Wistar rats, approximately 10 weeks of age change
  used by experimented.
- Rats were kept at 24 ± 2 °C temperature and in photoperiod of 12 h light and 12
  h dark, with free access to food and water.
- First, the rats were randomly divided into seven groups of eight control (in this
  group, there was no attendance), sham group (in this group the volume of food given
  to animals, distilled water as solvent, and extract were prescribed), experimental
  groups 1, 2, and 3 (cyclophosphamide receptors (5 mg/kg/bw) + saffron hydroalcoholic
  extract with doses (2, 1 and 0.5 g/kg/bw)), experimental group 4 (received saffron
  with dose 2g/kg/bw), and experimental group 5 (received cyclophosphamide with dose
  5 mg/kg/bw).
- Cyclophosphamide was given intraperitoneally, and the extract was prescribed by
  gavage for 21 days.
- At the end of the experiment, the animals were comatosed with ether and, after blooding,
  samples were collected in sterile plastic tubes and held for 20 min at room temperature,
  then centrifuged for 15 min at 3,000 rpm and the serum separated and stored at −30
  °C.
- The ELISA method was then used for the evaluation of the estrogen, progesterone,
  FSH, and LH hormones.
- 'Statistical data analysis: The results were analyzed using SPSS software version
  15 and one-way ANOVA and LSD statistical test (_p_ &lt; 0.05).'
- The average and standard deviations were calculated and graphs were plotted by the
  Excel software.
- The results of this study show that the average concentration of the estrogen, progesterone,
  and LH hormones in the cyclophosphamide-receiving group (Figs.
- 1, 2, and 3), concentration of the progesterone hormone in the experimental group
  1 (cyclophosphamide + minimum saffron dose) (Fig.
- 2), and concentration of the hormone FSH in the experimental group 3 (cyclophosphamide
  + maximum saffron dose) (Fig.
- 3) shows a significant decrease in comparison with the control group.
- However, in the experimental group 3 (cyclophosphamide + maximum saffron dose),
  there is a significant increase in the concentration of the estrogen hormone (Fig.
- 1).
- In the experimental groups 1, 2, 3, and 4 (Fig.
- 4), there is a decrease in serum level LH compared with the control group, which
  is seen just in group 1 (_p_ &lt; 0.05).
- In all graphs asterisk indicates a significant difference between the groups with
  the control group.
- In cyclophosphamide-induced reproductive toxicity via oxidative stress, prescribing
  antioxidant will decrease toxicity.
- The ability of phosphamide in the production of free radicals has been reported
  in rats (Lear et al.
- 1992).
- In this study, concentration of the estrogen, progesterone, and FSH hormones in
  the cyclophosphamide-receiving group has a significant decrease in comparison with
  the control group (Figs.
- 1, 2, and 3); however, no significant difference with the control group is seen
  in concentration of the LH hormone in this group (Fig.
- 4).
- Studies indicate that metabolites of cyclophosphamide can be produced to reduce
  steroid hormones in granulose cells (Ramahi et al.
- 1988).
- However, women who were treated with cyclophosphamide did not experience a decrease
  in estrogen and progesterone plasma (McDermott and Powell 1996).
- In another study, decreased granulosa cell survival in mice treated with cyclophosphamide
  and save progesterone have been reported (Khalid et al.
- 1989).
- Studies show that women who have been treated with cyclophosphamide may have reproductive
  disorders (Wang et al.
- 1995), amenorrhea, and increased number of atretic follicles and decreased plasma
  levels of progesterone and estrogen experience (McDermott and Powell 1996).
- Also, cyclophosphamide can affect DNA, break it, and also have an effect on RNA
  and decrease protein synthesis (Dollery 1999).
- Probably, in the experimental group 5 (Fig.
- 3), the structure of FSH, which is polypeptide (Guyton and Hall 1996) and the effect
  of active metabolites of cyclophosphamide, the phosphorus amide mustard, and acrulyn
  on the anterior pituitary or hypothalamus that regulate folicogenesis, cause the
  decrease in serum FSH level, followed by a reduction of estrogen, which can also
  be explained by the toxic effect of cyclophosphamide on ovaries.
- These findings are in agreement with the results of other researchers (Deleve 2003;
  Khalid et al.
- 1989; Lopez and Luderey 2004).
- It is likely that in the experimental group 3, due to the destructive effects of
  active metabolites of cyclophosphamide on the analysis of the corpus luteum and
  destruction of granulose cells, in addition to the destruction of the harmful effects
  of high doses of saffron (Bisset and Wichtl 2001), ovarian tissue will also be affected
  by cyclophosphamide metabolites and destructive effects of saffron, thus accelerating
  analysis of the corpus luteum and increasing estrogen and progesterone.
- In one study, Mokhtari and colleagues found that saffron hydroalcoholic extract
  causes an increase in estrogen concentration (Mokhtari et al.
- 2010).
- The protective effect of saffron as a result of the chemicals in the antioxidants
  and reaction with free radicals (He sh et al.
- 2005; Abdullaer and Espinosa-Aguirrej 2004; Ochiai et al.
- 2004) can increase the serum concentration of estrogen in the experimental groups
  1, 2, and 4 in comparison with the experimental group 5, and the effects of cyclophosphamide
  metabolites can be partially alleviated.
- Significant decrease in the progesterone serum level in the experimental group 1
  compared with the control group (Fig.
- 1) may be a result of the appropriate dose of saffron.
- Premkumar and his colleagues (2003) reported the effect of saffron on changes in
  lipid peroxidation and antioxidant status in spite of sin platinum, cyclophosphamide,
  mitomycin, and urea in mice to investigate and found that the administration of
  saffron, lipid peroxidation, reduced antioxidant enzyme (such as peroxide dismutase,
  catalase), and enzymatic (GSH) of liver increase, so saffron may be through its
  effect on lipid peroxidation, antioxidants, and detoxification systems of genotoxic
  effects induced by antitumor drugs to prevent (Premkumar et al.
- 2003).
- In the experimental groups 1, 2, 3, and 4, a decrease in serum FSH level is seen
  which, when compared to the control group, is not significant in other groups except
  for the experimental group 3.
- Crocin is probably due to the protective properties against chemical materials,
  which inhibit the reaction of free radicals, induction of apoptosis, and inhibition
  of tumor growth by interfering with DNA structure and function (Abdullaer and Espinosa-Aguirrej
  2004); it could prevent the effects of acrulyn and phosphorus amide mustard and
  increase serum FSH level in the experimental groups 1, 2, and 3 compared to group
  5 (Fig.
- 3).
- Saffron is highly toxic in large quantities (Bisset and Wichtl 2001).
- It is also reported that saffron consumption in high doses can cause miscarriage
  (Bisset and Wichtl 2001; EbrahimZade 2007), so despite the beneficial effects of
  saffron, it should be used in an appropriate dose.
- According to Fig.
- 3 and probably in the experimental group 4 due to high dose, saffron extract did
  not have a protective effect on ovaries, so there is no expected increase in serum
  level in the experimental group 4 (Fig.
- 3).
- Prescribing saffron with an appropriate dose during chemotherapy for reducing stress
  and detoxification due to the prescription of cyclophosphamide, appears to make
  tissue detoxification necessary.
- In other words, concurrent prescription of antioxidants and cyclophosphamide will
  decrease the incidence of reproductive toxicity.
