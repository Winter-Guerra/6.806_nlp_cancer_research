- Breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) constitute a small fraction of the primary tumor
  that can self-renew and become a drug-resistant cell population, thus limiting the
  treatment effects of chemotherapeutic drugs.
- The present study evaluated the cytotoxic effects of five phytochemicals including
  6-gingerol (6-G), 6-shogaol (6-S), 5-hydroxy-3,6,7,8,3′,4′-hexamethoxyflavone (5-HF),
  nobiletin (NOL), and pterostilbene (PTE) on MCF-7 breast cancer cells and BCSCs.
- The results showed that 6-G, 6-S, and PTE selectively killed BCSCs and had high
  sensitivity for BCSCs isolated from MCF-7 cells that expressed the surface antigen
  CD44+/CD24–.
- 6-S and PTE induced cell necrosis phenomena such as membrane injury and bleb formation
  in BCSCs and inhibited mammosphere formation.
- In addition, 6-S and PTE increased the sensitivity of isolated BCSCs to chemotherapeutic
  drugs and significantly increased the anticancer activity of paclitaxel.
- Analysis of the underlying mechanism showed that 6-S and PTE decreased the expression
  of the surface antigen CD44 on BCSCs and promoted β-catenin phosphorylation through
  the inhibition of hedgehog/Akt/GSK3β signaling, thus decreasing the protein expression
  of downstream c-Myc and cyclin D1 and reducing BCSC stemness.
- The fifth most common cause of cancer death in the world, breast cancer is highly
  metastatic, easy to relapse, and difficult to cure, and it has a high mortality
  rate.
- It was first proposed by scholars in 1997 that a small portion of cancer cells could
  replicate in vitro to form colonies; these cells were called cancer stem cells (CSCs).
- CSCs form tumors in immunodeficient mice at a density of 0.0001–0.1% of that required
  for general tumor cells;(1) therefore, they are also known as tumorigenic cells
  or tumor-forming cells.
- (2) Currently, the evolvement of breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) into a drug-resistant
  cell population and their high metastatic capability have been considered the major
  reasons for breast cancer recurrence, which limits the effects of clinical treatment
  for breast cancer.
- The cancer stem cell hypothesis proposes that CSCs are the key factors for the promotion
  of abnormal proliferation, invasion, metastasis, drug resistance, and recurrence
  of tumor cells.
- (3) Using acute myeloid leukemia as an example, leukemia stem cells, which also
  express the CD34+/CD38– surface antigen, similar to hematopoietic stem cells, have
  the feature of self-renewal and highly induce tumor formation in nonobese diabetic/severe
  combined immunodeficiency (NOD/SCID) mice.
- (4) Subsequent studies gradually confirmed the presence of CSCs in many types of
  tumors, such as breast cancer, brain cancer, lung cancer, prostate cancer, colon
  cancer, melanoma, and pancreatic cancer.
- '(5-9)


  A CSC can undergo asymmetric cell division to produce a differentiated daughter
  cell and a CSC; this biological feature can not only preserve the CSC stemness but
  also increase their differentiated cell populations.'
- (3, 10) On this basis, it is known that CSCs can produce cancer cells that have
  gene polymorphisms to form tumors, which are also resistant to chemotherapeutic
  drugs.
- (10) In addition, a branch of the population of CSCs, known as metastatic CSCs (mCSCs),
  can secrete pro-metastasis niche factors in the tumor microenvironment to promote
  the metastatic seeding of mCSCs in blood vessels, which plays important roles in
  the process of tumor metastasis.
- Studies have shown that chemotherapeutic drugs reactivate signals to stimulate cancer
  cell metastasis.
- (11) Previous studies have also shown that the self-renewal ability of CSCs is associated
  with the regulatory pathways of hedgehog, Notch, PI3K/Akt, and Wnt/β-catenin.
- (12) These signaling pathways might also participate in the maintenance of the stemness
  of CD44+/CD24–/low BCSCs.
- '(13)


  In vitro cultured CSCs aggregate into floating clumps to facilitate attachment and
  differentiation; these clumps are called spheroids and are specifically called mammospheres
  with regard to BCSCs.'
- After long-term culture, mammospheres produce a functional mammary tree structure;(14)
  similar findings have also been discovered in neurospheres and prostatospheres.
- (15, 16) Currently, there are many isolation methods for CSCs.
- For example, cell populations can be isolated from tumor tissues,(1) cells can be
  collected after labeling the cell surface antigens CD44+ or CD133+,(17) and CSCs
  that have survived chemotherapeutic drug treatment can be obtained using their drug-resistance
  feature.
- (3, 10) In addition, using the induction of epithelia to mesenchymal transition
  (EMT) in tumor cells, the specific tumor cell population that exhibits stemness
  after dedifferentiation can be obtained.
- '(18)


  Gupta et al.'
- (19) showed that salinomycin selectively kills CSCs and effectively inhibits BCSC
  survival and mammosphere formation.
- These results showed that specific inhibition of mammosphere formation might be
  regarded as an effective measure for breast cancer treatment.
- Because therapeutic drugs, such as paclitaxel, doxorubicin, docetaxel, and cyclophosphamide,
  are already used to target breast cancer, development of an adjuvant therapy to
  target CSCs from natural products that are highly safe, do not have side effects,
  and can strengthen the effect of chemotherapeutic drugs should be a feasible strategy
  for breast cancer treatment.

  6-Gingerol (6-G) is the most abundant polyphenolic compound in ginger (_Zingiber
  officinalis_); after dehydration, 6-G becomes 6-shogaol (6-S), which has higher
  physiological activities.'
- 6-S is the source of the pungent constituent of ginger; it can attenuate neuroinflammation
  and cognitive deficits(20) and induce colon cancer cell apoptosis through the induction
  of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and activation of the caspase pathway.
- (21) Weng et al.
- (22) showed that 6-S and 6-G inhibit the invasive characteristics of liver cancer
  cells.
- Pterostilbene (PTE), which is extensively present in blueberries and grapes, is
  a dimethylated analogue of resveratrol and a natural antibacterial substance.
- (23) Simoni et al.
- (24) confirmed that PTE can effectively induce apoptosis in HL-60 leukemia cells
  and can inhibit the invasion and metastasis functions of HepG2 liver cancer cells
  through the inhibition of the expression of NF-κB and AP-1 transcriptional factors
  and MMP-9.
- (23) Nobiletin (5,6,7,8,3′,4′-hexamethoxyflavone, NOL) and 5-hydroxy-3,6,7,8,3′,4′-hexamethoxyflavone
  (5-HF) are both flavonoids in citrus fruits; previous studies have confirmed that
  they have antitumor potentials, such as the inhibition of tumor cell invasion and
  promotion of apoptosis.
- '(25, 26)


  Modern chemotherapies are designed to prevent the local recurrences of primary tumors
  and the distant metastases of tumor cells.'
- However, the effective doses of many chemotherapeutics cause severe side effects.
- There is considerable interest in the discovery and investigation of more potent
  anticancer stemness compounds to prevent and delay cancer recurrence.
- Important attributes of an ideal inhibitor would be easy obtainment, absorption,
  and excretion, little or none toxicity, and the absence of serious side effects.
- Naturally occurring polyphenols such as 6-G, 6-S, 5-HF, NOL, and PTE should, therefore,
  be ideal candidates for reducing cancer stemness.
- Although previous paper have described the antitumor activities of the above phytochemicals,
  no studies have been made of their selective cytotoxic effects on CSCs and their
  parental cancer cells.
- In the field of CSC studies, BCSCs were discovered early and could be identified
  using cell surface antigens.
- Therefore, there are detailed reports on the isolation and identification of CSCs
  that can be referenced.
- On the basis of these reports, this study aimed to investigate the effects of 6-S,
  6-G, PTE, NOL, and 5-HF on BCSC proliferation and clarify the underlying molecular
  mechanisms.

- The MCF-7 human breast adenocarcinoma cell line was obtained from the Bioresource
  Collection and Research Center (BCRC 60436; Food Industry Research and Development
  Institute) and was cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% v/v FBS in a humidified
  atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2.
- The medium was changed three times per week.
- The MCF-7 cells were estrogen receptor positive and characterized as having a low
  metastatic phenotype.
- MCF-7 cells were detached and resuspended in PBS containing 1% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin
  (106 cells/100 μL).
- Combinations of fluorochrome-conjugated monoclonal antibodies against human CD44

  °C in the dark for 30 min.
- Cells were analyzed and sorted on an FACSAria Cell Sorter unit (Becton Dickinson,

- BCSCs were gated on low side scatter, low-to-moderate forward scatter, and low PI.
- The CD44+/CD24–/low phenotype was used to identify and isolate BCSCs, according
  to a previous study.
- (30) For data acquisition, at least 10000 events were analyzed.
- The purity and viability of isolated cells were routinely &gt;98%, as determined
  by trypan blue dye exclusion.
- The sorted BCSCs were cultured in stem cell medium (SCM, DMEM/F12 medium containing
  B27 supplement, 10 ng/mL EGF, bFGF, and ITSS) without FBS.
- Sorted cells were plated on ultralow attachment plates (Corning, Acton, MA, USA)
  at a density of 20000 viable cells per milliliter and a density of 1000 cells per
  milliliter for subsequent passages.
- Cells were grown in SCM as described above.
- Mammospheres were collected by gentle centrifugation (800 rpm) after 7–10 days and
  were dissociated enzymatically (10 min in 0.05% trypsin) and mechanically, using
  a fire-polished Pasteur pipet.
- The cells obtained from dissociation were passed through a 40 μm sieve and analyzed
  microscopically for single cellularity.
- Cells plated at low densities (1000 cells/mL) were grown in conditioned medium from
  high-density sorted cultures in suspension.
- BCSCs were harvested and seeded in six-well plates (5 × 104 cells/well) coated with
  0.6% agarose.
- Anchorage-independent growth was assessed after incubation for 10–14 days in culture
  medium with or without the tested phytochemicals (0, 25, and 50 μM), which was replaced
  every 2 days.
- The plates were stained with 0.005% crystal violet, and the colonies were counted
  manually under a microscope and imaged.
- BCSCs were treated with 6-S or PTE for 4–24 h. After treatment, the cell lysates
  and nuclear fractions were prepared using a nuclear/cytosol fractionation kit.
- The protein concentrations of the cell lysate and nuclear fractions were estimated
  with the Bio-Rad DC protein assay using BSA as the standard.
- Total proteins (25–50 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE using a 10% polyacrylamide
  gel and then transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane.
- The membrane was blocked with 1% fish gelatin in PBS with 0.05% Tween 20 (pH 7.2)
  for 1 h. The membranes were then incubated with primary antibodies (1:1000) at 4
  °C overnight, followed by incubation with a horseradish peroxide-linked secondary
  antibody (1:10000).
- The protein bands were visualized using the ChemiLucent ECL Detection System (Millipore)
  and the Biospectrum AC Imaging System (UVP, Upland, CA, USA).
- The expression levels of the proteins of interest were normalized to the expression
  of β-actin.
- The intensity of the chemiluminescence signal was quantified using the UVP VisionWorksLS
  Image Acquisition and Analysis software.
- Each experiment was performed in triplicate.
- The results are expressed as the mean ± SD.
- The statistical analyses were performed using SAS software, and the variances were
  assessed using ANOVAs.
- Significant differences (_p_ &lt; 0.05) between the means were identified by Duncan’s
  multiple-range tests.
- This study selected five phytochemicals, 6-G, 6-S, 5-HF, NOL, and PTE (Figure 1A),
  to evaluate with regard to their cytotoxicity on MCF-7 BCSCs (CD44+/CD24– subpopulations
  of MCF-7 cells) and MCF-7 breast cancer cells using the trypan blue assay.
- The results showed that, of the above five phytochemicals tested at doses of 0.1–75
  μM, the IC50 values of 6-G, 6-S, and PTE on BCSCs were 50, 25, and 25 μM, respectively
  (Figure 1B), which was more significant than their effects on MCF-7 parental cells
  (Figure 1C).
- Of note, none of these compounds had a cytotoxic effect on primary cultured rat
  hepatocytes at a concentration of 25 μM for the same time frame (Supporting Information).
- These results indicated that 6-S and PTE had potent selective toxic effects on BCSCs.
- Subsequent experiments evaluated the effects of 6-S and PTE on BCSC characteristics.

- '6-S and PTE Induce Changes in Cell Morphology and Mammosphere-Forming Capacity
  of BCSCs


  The images of cell morphology in Figure 2A show that after a 6 h treatment with
  6-S or PTE, cell necrosis phenomena, such as membrane injury and bleb formation,
  were induced in BCSCs.'
- Mammosphere formation is an important indicator of BCSC differentiation.
- After BCSCs were treated with 6-S or PTE for 72 h, robust mammosphere disruptions
  were induced (Figure 2B, left panel), and the number of mammospheres was effectively
  reduced (Figure 2B, right panel).
- In addition, this study further simulated a nutrient-deficient or -sufficient environment
  using SCM without FBS or RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS, respectively, to investigate
  the effects of 6-S and PTE on mammospheres under different FBS concentrations.
- The results showed that large BCSC mammospheres were easily induced in a nutrient-deficient
  environment, whereas mammospheres were at a dormant status in a nutrient-sufficient
  environment.
- Under culture conditions without FBS, PTE more effectively reduced the volume of
  mammospheres than 6-S and promoted their disintegration; however, in an environment
  containing FBS, neither compound had any influence on mammospheres (Figure 2C).
- Figure 2.
- Effects of 6-G, 6-S, and PTE on BCSC morphology, mammosphere formation, and colony

- 'Effects of 6-S or PTE Combined with Paclitaxel on the Differentiated BCSC Population


  This study cultured BCSCs in RPMI medium containing 10% FBS to promote differentiation
  to observe the effects of the chemotherapeutic drug paclitaxel on the differentiated
  BCSC population when combined with either 6-S or PTE.'
- Figure 3A shows that 10 nM paclitaxel had significant cytotoxic effects on the differentiated
  BCSC populations; however, this cytotoxicity was not increased when the dose was
  increased to 50 nM (Figure 3A, _p_ &gt; 0.05).
- It is worth noting that 6-S and PTE (Figure 3B) already doubled the cytotoxicity
  of chemotherapeutic drugs on the differentiated BCSC populations at low doses (0.5
  and 10 μM; Figure 3C); therefore, they may increase the antitumor effects of chemotherapeutic
  drugs.
- Figure 3.
- Effects of paclitaxel with or without 6-S and PTE on cell morphology and viability
  of differentiated BCSCs.
- BCSCs were first cultured in RPMI medium plus 10% FBS for 7 days to simulate differentiation.
- Cells were then treated with different concentrations of paclitaxel (A) and 10 nM
  paclitaxel plus 6-S or 10 nM paclitaxel plus PTE (B) for 72 h. (C) Quantified cell
  viability in groups A and B.
- The reported values are the mean ± SD (_n_ = 3).
- Bars with different letters are significantly different from each other in individual
  assays (_p_ &lt; 0.05).
- It is known that the degree of breast cancer cell malignancy is closely associated
  with the expression of CD44+/CD24– on stem cells.
- (30) When the CD44 surface antigen is activated, breast cancer cell populations
  evolve into cell populations that have increased invasiveness.
- This study used flow cytometry to observe the effects of 6-S or PTE on stem cell
  surface antigen expression in BCSCs.
- The cell population in the CD44+/CD24– quadrant was the BCSC population, whereas
  the cell population in the CD44–/CD24– quadrant was the cell population that had
  lost stemness.
- Figure 4 shows that after culture of 6-S or PTE (25 μM) with BCSCs for 72 h, the
  number of BCSCs was inhibited, and the number of cells that did not have stemness
  was significantly increased (_p_ &lt; 0.05).
- The maintenance of BCSC stemness was inhibited through a decrease in CD44 expression.
- Figure 4.
- Effects of 6-S and PTE on the expression of the cell surface marker CD44/CD24 in

- The cells were treated with 0–25 μM 6-S and PTE for 72 h. FITC/PE double-stained
  cells were analyzed by flow cytometry.
- Cells that were CD44+/CD24– represent the BCSC population.
- Cells with CD44–/CD24– represent a loss of stemness.
- ∗, _p_ &lt; 0.05, indicates significant differences compared with the control group.
- The hedgehog signal transduction pathway and β-catenin transcription activity can
  regulate the differentiation and self-renewal of CSCs.
- (31) Many studies have regarded the hedgehog pathway as an important indicator for
  the suppression of drug resistance in CSCs and tumor recurrence.
- This study cultured BCSCs in SCM with 6-S or PTE (5 and 25 μM) for 4, 8, and 24
  h and analyzed the changes in the expression levels of hedgehog, phospho-Akt, Akt,
  phospho-GSK3β, and GSK3β.
- The results showed that 6-S (Figure 5A) and PTE (Figure 5B) effectively inhibited
  hedgehog protein expression and Akt and GSK3β phosphorylation (_p_ &lt; 0.05).
- Figure 5.
- Effects of 6-S (A) and PTE (B) on protein expression of hedgehog signaling in BCSCs.
- Cells were treated with 25 μM of tested compounds for 4, 8, and 24 h, respectively.
- The relative density was compared with the control.
- All experiments were performed in duplicate and repeated at least three times.
- Quantitative data are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation.
- Bars with different letters are significantly different from each other in individual
  assays (_p_ &lt; 0.05).
- 'Effects of 6-S and PTE on β-Catenin Phosphorylation and Downstream Protein Expression
  in BCSCs


  The Wnt/β-catenin signaling transduction pathway is very important for the maintenance
  of CSC stemness.'
- Studies have indicated that β-catenin activation is an important target for regulation
  of CSC differentiation and inhibition of tumor recurrence.
- In this study, BCSCs were treated with 6-S or PTE (5 and 25 μM) for 4, 8, and 24
  h to analyze the changes in the expression of phospho-β-catenin, β-catenin, cyclin
  D1, and c-Myc.
- The results showed that 6-S (Figure 6A) and PTE (Figure 6B), at a concentration
  of 25 μM, significantly induced β-catenin phosphorylation to increase its degradation
  and inhibit protein expression of cyclin D1 and c-Myc (_p_ &lt; 0.05).
- Therefore, 6-S and PTE both effectively increased the level of β-catenin phosphorylation
  and inhibited the expression of the downstream cyclin D1 and c-Myc proteins; the
  inhibitory effect of PTE was more significant.
- Figure 6.
- Effect of 6-S (A) and PTE (B) on protein expression of β-catenin, c-Myc, and cyclin

- The cells were treated with 25 μM of tested compounds for 4, 8, and 24 h, respectively.
- The relative density was compared with the control.
- All experiments were performed in duplicate and repeated at least three times.
- Quantitative data are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation.
- Bars with different letters are significantly different from each other in individual
  assays (_p_ &lt; 0.05).
- General stem cells have the ability to differentiate into many different cells.
- However, abnormal stem cells will develop into abnormal cell populations.
- These abnormal stem cells are CSCs.
- Because CSCs can survive in a nutrient- and oxygen-deficient environment and have
  drug resistance, they are considered one reason that cancer cannot be completely
  cured.
- Phytochemicals have been discovered to have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and
  antitumor activities.
- Because their side effects can be milder than those of chemotherapeutic drugs, they
  have been extensively applied and investigated in clinical cancer studies.
- (12) For example, citrus fruits are rich in NOL and 5-HF, which have been discovered
  in previous studies to have anti-invasion activity against cancer cells and can
  inhibit colon cancer proliferation and induce apoptosis.
- (32) The study by Weng et al.
- (22) showed that the active ingredients of ginger, 6-G and 6-S, and the component
  of berries, PTE, inhibit liver cancer cell metastasis.
- Our previous studies showed that 6-S and PTE inhibit invadopodia formation in breast
  cancer cells and inhibit invasive metastasis.
- (33) Therefore, these two phytochemicals, 6-S and PTE, might have excellent antitumor
  potential.
- This study selected the above phytochemicals to investigate their effects on the
  suppression of BCSC survival and mammosphere formation as well as the effects of
  complementary chemotherapeutic drugs on BCSCs.
- The antitumor activity and the molecular mechanism of 6-S and PTE were also clarified.
- A review of the study by Gupta et al.
- (19) and many other papers showed that because BCSCs have the feature of self-renewal
  and might produce drug resistance, during the screening of compounds that can inhibit
  BCSC survival, the culture time should be estimated to at least the third generation.
- Therefore, 72 h was selected as the culture time in this study to investigate the
  effects of these compounds.
- The MCF-7 breast cancer cells and the human BCSCs isolated from MCF-7 cells using
  CD44+/CD24–/low were treated with different concentrations (0–75 μM) of 5-HF, 6-G,
  6-S, NOL, and PTE to evaluate their effects on cell survival.
- 6-S and PTE demonstrated the highest cytotoxicity levels against BCSCs.
- After BCSCs were treated with 25 μM 6-S or PTE for 72 h, the cell survival rate
  was reduced to &lt;50%.
- However, treatment of MCF-7 breast cancer cells with these two chemicals at 25 μM
  (LD50) for 72 h showed that the cell survival rates were both maintained above 80%.
- Next, after BCSCs were treated with 6-G at 50 μM for 72 h, the cell survival rate
  was also reduced to 50%, whereas under the same concentration and time, the survival
  rate of treated MCF-7 cells was maintained at 90% (Figure 1B,C).
- Therefore, these three compounds might have the potential to specifically inhibit
  BCSCs.
- Further treatment of cells with these three compounds at a concentration of 25 or
  100 μM showed that 6-S and PTE promoted bleb formation on the surface of BCSCs within
  3–6 h, whereas 6-G did not cause bleb formation under the same conditions (Figure
  2A).
- Therefore, it was speculated that 6-S and PTE had the most potential to inhibit
  BCSCs.
- Because their influences on the regulation of intracellular signaling proteins might
  start between 3 and 6 h, subsequent experiments selected 4, 8, and 24 h as controls.
- CSCs have self-renewal and high differentiation potentials.
- Their growth does not require serum, their number in cell populations is small,
  and they are present as an unstable suspension.
- In in vitro cultured BCSCs, they aggregate into floating clumps to facilitate attached
  differentiation.
- These clumps are called spheroids and are specifically called mammospheres in breast
  cancer cells.
- Mammospheres form a functional mammary tree after long-term culture.
- Studies have shown that treatment of sulforaphane (5 μM) with BCSC-like cells isolated
  using ALDH for 7 days effectively reduced the size of mammospheres.
- (34) Kakarala et al.
- (35) treated mammospheres with curcumin or piperine and obtained similar results.
- The results of this study in Figure 2B,C confirmed that 6-S and PTE reduced the
  size and number of mammospheres.
- There are already several drugs in clinical use with excellent treatment effects
  on breast cancer such as cyclophosphamide, paclitaxel, doxorubicin, and docetaxel;
  therefore, current treatment strategies that target CSCs might supplement chemodrugs
  to achieve the goal of eliminating breast cancer.
- (3, 12) Therefore, the present study referenced the method of Lee et al.
- (36) to add serum into the BCSC culture to promote cell differentiation to simulate
  the condition of tumor recurrence and growth.
- Next, 6-S, PTE, and paclitaxel were cultured with this cell population for 72 h
  to observe whether these two compounds and paclitaxel had a synergistic effect on
  the suppression of tumor growth.
- The results in Figure 3 show that although paclitaxel (10 and 50 nM) had toxicity
  on the differentiated cell population of BCSCs, the effect was not dose dependent
  (_p_ &gt; 0.05).
- Of note, 6-S and PTE had auxiliary effects on paclitaxel to reduce the survival
  of that cell population.
- Studies have shown that the combination of curcumin (10 μM) and paclitaxel (10 μM)
  significantly reduced tumor size in nude mice, decreased MMP-9 expression in tumor,
  and promoted breast cancer cell apoptosis.
- (37) The study by Aggarwal et al.
- (38) also indicated that curcumin (50 μM), which is a polyphenolic compound similar
  to the samples used in this study, assists paclitaxel (10 μM) in reducing the survival
  rate of breast cancer MDA-MB435 cells by 80%.
- The present study demonstrated that 6-S and PTE inhibit BCSCs from forming mammospheres
  and have synergistic effects with paclitaxel.
- To confirm the mechanism underlying the regulation of BCSC characteristics by these
  two compounds, further investigation was performed on whether the signaling pathway
  of BCSCs to maintain their self-renewal was affected by 6-S and PTE.
- CSCs are identified using different cell surface antigens; for example, BCSCs have
  been isolated using CD44+/CD24–/low expression on the cell surface of MCF-7 cells.
- (5) The decrease of CD44 expression reduced the tumorigenicity of BCSCs in vivo;
  thus, it was speculated that CD44 expression is associated with the maintenance
  of stemness.
- (39) Therefore, this study cultured 6-S or PTE with BCSCs for 72 h to observe their
  influences on CD44 and CD24 cell surface antigens.
- Figure 4 shows that 6-S and PTE effectively decreased the expression of CD44.
- This result was similar to the results of So et al.,(40) who used a novel Gemini
  vitamin D analogue, BXL0124.
- Recent studies also showed that caffeic acid phenethyl ester, a derivative of the
  natural polyphenolic compound caffeic acid, reduces the percentage of CSCs in the
  MDA-MB231 cell line to inhibit CSC proliferation.
- (41) Studies have also shown that acetaminophen induces BCSC differentiation, decreases
  CD44 expression, and causes these cells to lose tumorigenicity in nude mice.

  It is known that hedgehog, Notch, PI3K/Akt, and Wnt/β-catenin are associated with
  self-renewal of cells and stem cell survival in normal organs or embryonic stem
  cells.'
- (12) Studies have indicated that these signaling pathways might also participate
  in the maintenance of the stemness of CD44+/CD24–/low BCSCs.
- (13) CSCs play very important roles in the recurrence and growth of many tumors,
  whereas Wnt/β-catenin is associated with CSC differentiation.
- In many antitumor (such as lung cancer and brain cancer) studies that have targeted
  CSCs, the inhibition of intracellular concentration and the transcription activity
  of β-catenin were used as a target.
- (10, 43) Hope et al.
- (44) used a low dose of resveratrol to regulate β-catenin transcription activities
  and achieved the inhibition of the differentiation of many liver cancer cells to
  prevent the aggravation of liver cancer.
- Therefore, inhibition of the transcription activity of β-catenin might successfully
  inhibit CSCs to produce drug resistance and promote tumor recurrence.

  Studies showed that the EMT pathway can induce tumor cells to produce CSCs with
  stemness; therefore, if EMT activation could be inhibited through the TGF-β or Wnt
  signaling pathways, then CSC proliferation could be reduced.'
- The EMT pathway is induced by the Twist and Snail proteins.
- Twist can inhibit the phosphorylation of the downstream β-catenin and Snail proteins
  through the promotion of phosphorylation of Akt (Ser 473) and GSK3β (Ser 9) to increase
  CD44 expression and achieve the goal of maintaining stemness.
- In addition, Twist can also inhibit E-cadherin activation and its ability to bind
  β-catenin, which further inhibits cell invasion and metastasis.
- (39) The regulation of Akt and GSK3β is also affected by the hedgehog signaling
  pathway.
- Sonic hedgehog interacts with its transmembrane receptor patched to release smoothed
  protein to further activate PI3K and Akt, thus promoting GSK3β phosphorylation and
  reducing its activity.
- When GSK3β activity decreased, β-catenin phosphorylation is reduced, and its degradation
  pathway is suppressed; at the same time, CG44 expression is increased.
- Excess β-catenin translocates into the nucleus to promote cell proliferation and
  differentiation and then interacts with the TCF/LEF complex to transcribe cyclin
  D1 and c-Myc.
- Furthermore, the levels of phosphorylated Akt, phosphorylated GSK3β, and β-catenin
  in mammospheres are all significantly higher than those in general attachment-type
  tumor cells.
- (46) Introduction of the Akt inhibitor perifosine (orally active alkyl-phosphocholine)
  into mammary stem cells or progenitor cells promotes β-catenin phosphorylation.
- Therefore, this study focused on whether 6-S and PTE had inhibitory effects on the
  signaling pathways that maintained the above CSC characteristics.
- Results in this study showed that treatment of BCSCs with 6-S (5 μM) for 8 h significantly
  decreased hedgehog expression and Akt phosphorylation.
- 6-S at a concentration of 25 μM significantly decreased hedgehog expression and
  Akt phosphorylation after 4 h, and this effect was stably maintained for 24 h (Figure
  5A).
- Figure 6A shows that treatment of BCSCs with 6-S (25 μM) for 8 h increased β-catenin
  phosphorylation and caused its degradation.
- Further observation of the expression of downstream cyclin D1 and c-Myc proteins
  also showed that 6-S at a concentration of 25 μM triggered down-regulation of cyclin
  D1 and c-Myc within 4 h. A previous study treated a polyphenolic compound, curcumin
  (50 μM), with MDA-MB435 breast cancer cells and showed that the expression of cyclin
  D1 and c-Myc proteins was inhibited.

  The results in Figure 5B show that PTE cultured with BCSCs significantly inhibited
  hedgehog expression and Akt phosphorylation.'
- In addition, with regard to GSK3β activity, PTE reduced the levels of GSK3β phosphorylation.
- At 25 μM, PTE increased β-catenin phosphorylation and promoted its degradation (Figure
  6B).
- Further observation of the downstream cyclin D1 and c-Myc protein expression showed
  that PTE also effectively reduced the expression of these two proteins.
- The study by Lepourcelet et al.
- (47) also observed that the two natural compounds isolated from fungi, PKF115-584
  and CGF049090 (5 μM), significantly inhibited the intracellular concentrations of
  β-catenin and the expression of cyclin D1 and c-Myc proteins.
- In summary, the increased phosphorylation of β-catenin by 6-S and PTE might be through
  the reduction of hedgehog protein expression and Akt and GSK3β phosphorylation,
  thus reducing the expression of downstream c-Myc and cyclin D1 proteins (Figure
  7).
- Therefore, 6-S and PTE activated β-catenin degradation to reduce CD44 activity and
  affect the maintenance of stemness of CSCs to further induce the loss of tumorigenicity
  of these BCSCs.
- Figure 7.
- Schematic representation of the mechanisms of action by 6-S and PTE in the inhibition
  of BCSC stemness.
- 6-S and PTE mediate CD44 expression through the reduction of hedgehog and β-catenin
  in BCSCs.
- 6-S and PTE lead to reduced expression of hedgehog, inhibit the phosphorylation
  of Akt and GSK3β, and decrease the translocation of β-catenin, followed by the down-regulation
  of CD44, c-Myc, and cyclin D1 expression.
