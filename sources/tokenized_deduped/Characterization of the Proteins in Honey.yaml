- This study focused on the extraction and identification of honey proteins from selected
  samples (Acacia, Tualang, and Gelam) from Malaysia.
- The extraction methods, dialysis, ammonium sulfate, and sodium tungstate precipitation
  methods, were used to obtain the proteins from the honey.
- The method of membrane dialysis provided the highest yield of proteins based on
  the Bradford assay.
- This method also provided the highest number of protein bands and the clearest protein
  bands on a 12% polyacrylamide gel compared with the other two precipitation methods.
- The results revealed that the precipitation methods may degrade the proteins because
  of the use of strong chemicals and losses after repeated transfers.
- Mass spectrometric data showed that the honey contained major royal jelly proteins
  (MRJP) such as MRJP-1, MRJP-2, MRJP-5, and MRJP-7, as well as a few uncharacterized
  proteins from _Apis mellifera_.
- MRJP-1 was the most abundant protein, particularly in Acacia samples.
- Honey proteins were also shown to possess significant antioxidant activity as free
  radical scavengers and reducing agents.
