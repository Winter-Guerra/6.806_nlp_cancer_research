- This study investigated the combined effects of trans fat diet (TFD) and doxorubicin
  upon cardiac oxidative, inflammatory, and coagulatory stress.
- TFD increased trans fatty acid deposit in heart (_P_ &lt; 0.05), and decreased protein
  C and antithrombin-III activities in circulation (_P_ &lt; 0.05).
- TFD plus doxorubicin treatment elevated activities of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1,
  lactate dehydrogenase, and creatine phosphokinase (_P_ &lt; 0.05).
- This combination also raised xanthine oxidase activity, and enhanced cardiac levels
  of reactive oxygen species, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor-alpha,
  and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 than TFD or doxorubicin treatment alone (_P_
  &lt; 0.05).
- TFD alone increased cardiac nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) activity (_P_ &lt; 0.05),
  but failed to affect expression of NF-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
  (_P_ &gt; 0.05).
- Doxorubicin treatment alone augmented cardiac activity, mRNA expression, and protein
  production of NF-κB and MAPK (_P_ &lt; 0.05).
- TFD plus doxorubicin treatment further upregulated cardiac expression of NF-κB p65,
  p-p38, and p-ERK1/2 (_P_ &lt; 0.05).
- These findings suggest that TFD exacerbates doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity.
- It has been documented that the intake of trans fat (TF) rich diet increased the
  risk of coronary insufficiency, myocardial infarction, atherosclerosis, and metabolic
  disorders (Micha and Mozaffarian 2009; Mozaffarian and others 2009; Chen and others
  2011).
- Harvey and others (2008) reported that TF activated inflammatory responses and led
  to endothelial dysfunctions.
- Iwata and others (2011) indicated that elaidic acid (C18:1, trans) and linoelaidic
  acid (C18:2, trans) induced superoxide production in endothelial cells.
- Those studies suggest that TF could promote oxidative and inflammatory progression,
  and cause cardiovascular injury.
- Our previous study found that TF diet changed hepatic fatty acid profile, and increased
  hepatic inflammatory cytokines including interleukin (IL)-6 and monocyte chemoattractant
  protein (MCP)-1 in mice (Liu and others 2010).
- Thus, it is possible that dietary TF alters cardiac fatty acid composition, and
  enhanced cardiac oxidative and inflammatory stress.
- Doxorubicin (also called adriamycin) is a widely used chemotherapeutic agent for
  a variety of cancers.
- Its practical therapeutic use is limited because of its acute and chronic cardiotoxicities
  (Richard and others 2011; Octavia and others 2012).
- It is reported that doxorubicin evokes oxidative reactions in NADPH microsomal systems,
  and stimulates superoxide formation in heart, especially submitochondrial particles
  (Kalivendi and others 2005; Li and Yu 2008), which leads to overproduction of reactive
  oxygen species (ROS) and causes cardiomyocyte apoptosis.
- Furthermore, it has been indicated that nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK) are involved in doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity (Kang and
  others 2000; Kalivendi and others 2005), and the activation of these pathways facilitates
  the production of inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis (TNF)-alpha.
- Since TF and doxorubicin have adverse effects upon cardiac health, it is hypothesized
  that their interaction may exacerbate cardiac injury.
- In addition, Swystun and others (2011) reported that doxorubicin augmented thrombin-antithrombin
  complex formation, and favored coagulation or thrombosis.
- It seems hemostatic disorder also warrants attention when doxorubicin is used.
- Thus, our present study was designed to investigate the effects of TF and/or doxorubicin
  upon the variation of coagulation factors such as fibrinogen and anticoagulation
  factors such as protein C in order to understand their impact upon hemostatic balance.
- The major purpose of this present study was to examine the combined effects of TF-rich
  diet plus doxorubicin upon cardiac oxidative, inflammatory, and coagulatory stress.

  and the other was switched to a diet prepared by a commercial shortening, which
  was rich in trans fatty acids, and defined as TF diet (TFD).
- Diet composition is presented in Table 1.
- After 8-wk feeding, ND or TFD groups were further divided into 2 subgroups, in which
  doxorubicin (25 mg/kg) or saline was given via one single i.p.

- This homogenate was further mixed with buffer (60 mM Tris-HCl, 2% SDS, and 2% β-mercaptoethanol,
  pH 7.2), and boiled for 5 min.
- Sample at 40 _μ_g protein was applied to 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis,
  and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Millipore, Bedford, Mass., U.S.A.)
  for 1 h. After blocking with a solution containing 5% nonfat milk for 1 h to prevent
  nonspecific binding of antibody, membrane was incubated with mouse anti-NF-κB p50
  (1:1000), anti-NF-κB p65 (1:1000), anti-p38, anti-phospho-p38, anti-JNK, anti-phospho-JNK,

- The detected bands were quantified by an image analyzer (ATTO, Tokyo, Japan) and
  GAPDH was used as a loading control.
- The blot was quantified by densitometric analysis.
- Results were normalized to GAPDH, and given as arbitrary units.
- The effect of each treatment was analyzed from 10 mice (_n_ = 10) in each group.
- All data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD).
- Statistical analysis was done using one-way analysis of variance, and _post hoc_
  comparisons were carried out using Dunnet's _t_-test.
- Differences with _P_ &lt; 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
- In current study, shortening rich in trans fatty acids (529 mg/g, Table 2) was used
  to prepare TFD, which led to 71.93-fold increase in trans fatty acids when compared
  with ND (Table 3, _P_ &lt; 0.05).
- After 8-wk TFD intake, cardiac triglyceride content increased 40%; and cardiac levels
  of saturated and trans fatty acids also raised 1.52-fold and 32.5-fold, respectively
  (Table 4, _P_ &lt; 0.05).
- As shown in Table 5, doxorubicin treatment alone caused 6.05- and 4.11-fold elevation
  in LDH and CPK activities; and TFD treatment alone lowered 15% protein C and 31%
  AT-III activities (_P_ &lt; 0.05).
- However, TFD plus doxorubicin further raised 1.32-fold LDH, 1.26-fold CPK, and 1.16-fold
  PAI-1 activities when compared with doxorubicin treatment alone (_P_ &lt; 0.05).
- Doxorubicin treatment alone decreased GSH content, increased ROS and MDA levels,
  declined GPX and SOD activities, and enhanced XO activity in heart (Table 6, _P_
  &lt; 0.05).
- TFD intake alone decreased GSH level and raised XO activity (_P_ &lt; 0.05).
- Compared with doxorubicin alone, the combination of TFD and doxorubicin enhanced
  33% ROS production and 42% XO activity, and reduced 16% GSH content (_P_ &lt; 0.05).
- As shown in Table 7, doxorubicin treatment alone increased circulating CRP level,
  and cardiac IL-10 and MCP-1 levels (_P_ &lt; 0.05), but TFD did not affect test
  inflammatory factors.
- Compared with doxorubicin alone, TFD plus doxorubicin led to 2.61-, 2.04-, 2.92-,
  and 1.63-fold elevation in cardiac IL-6, IL-10, TNF-alpha, and MCP-1 levels (_P_
  &lt; 0.05).
- Doxorubicin treatment alone augmented cardiac activity, mRNA expression, and protein
  production of NF-κB (Figure 1A-1C, _P_ &lt; 0.05).
- TFD elevated NF-κB activity (_P_ &lt; 0.05), but failed to affect mRNA expression
  and protein production (_P_ &gt; 0.05).
- Compared with doxourbicin alone, TFD plus doxorubicin led to 53%, 55%, and 81% increase
  in NF-κB activity, NF-κB mRNA expression, and NF-κB p65 protein production.
- Doxorubicin treatment alone upregulated p-p38, p-ERK 1/2, and p-JNK (Figure 2, _P_
  &lt; 0.05), but TFD did not affect MAPK (_P_ &gt; 0.05).
- Compared with doxourbicin alone, TFD plus doxorubicin led to 52% and 43% elevation
  in p-p38 and p-ERK1/2 production (_P_ &lt; 0.05).

- Sanders and others (2003) reported that 2-wk trans fatty acids intake did not affect
  procoagulant and fibrinolytic markers such as fibrinogen and PAI-1 in young healthy
  men.
- Our data revealed that 8-wk TFD intake did not change these factors in circulation
  of mice.
- However, we found this diet diminished the activities of AT-III and protein C, 2
  anticoagulatory factors.
- AT-III inhibits the activities of several proteases in the coagulation cascade,
  and protein C inactivates coagulation factors such as factors Va and VIIIa (Asakawa
  and others 2000).
- Since dietary TF decreased anticoagulatory protection, it is highly possible that
  long-term TF intake promotes coagulatory progression and favors the development
  of thrombosis.
- In our present study, TF intake increased cardiac deposit of trans fatty acids;
  and markedly lowered GSH level, raised XO activity, and enhanced NF-κB activity
  in heart, which in turn enhanced cardiac oxidative responses.
- Moreover, we notified that TF intake increased cardiac levels of arachidonic acid
  (C20:4) and saturated fatty acids such as stearic acid (C18:0).
- It is known that these fatty acids promote lipotoxicity to cardiovascular system
  (Estadella and others 2013), in which arachidonic acid is a precursor for several
  key inflammatory mediators including prostaglandins (Calder 2009) and stearic acid
  could induce Toll-like receptor 4/2-independent inflammation (Anderson and others
  2012).
- Although TFD alone did not affect cardiac levels of test inflammatory factors, the
  increased C18:0 and C20:4 in heart contributed to raise inflammatory potential.
- These findings support that TF intake alters cardiac fatty acid profile and impairs
  cardiovascular functions.
- As reported by others (Yamamoto and others 2008; Trivedi and others 2011), our results
  agreed that doxorubicin activated both NF-κB and MAPK pathways, and caused severe
  cardiac oxidative stress via declining enzymatic antioxidant defense and increasing
  ROS and MDA formation.
- Morris and others (2011) reported that elevated CRP was an early biomarker of doxorubicin
  induced cardiotoxicity.
- Besides CRP, our present study further found that this drug augmented cardiac formation
  of MCP-1 and IL-10, 2 inflammatory biomarkers.
- MCP-1, a chemotactic factor for activating monocytes and macrophages, could recruit
  monocytes to the sites of injury (Martinovic and others 2005).
- The increased MCP-1 release from doxorubicin treatment indicated that cardiac tissue
  was injured and local immune response was activated.
- Teng and others (2010) reported that doxorubicin raised serum IL-10 level, and contributed
  to myocardial inflammation.
- However, IL-10 is an anti-inflammatory cytokine.
- Thus, the overproduced cardiac IL-10 in our present study not only revealed cardiac
  ongoing inflammatory status, but also highly implied that this tissue might intend
  to suppress inflammatory response via self-protective action.
- TFD plus doxorubicin substantially raised the activity of PAI-1, the primary physiologic
  inhibitor of fibrinolysis (Vaughan 2005), which subsequently suppressed fibrinolysis
  and favored thrombosis and atherogenesis (Urano and others 2000; Coffey and others
  2011).
- Thus, our findings suggest that TFD plus doxorubicin disturbs hemostatic balance,
  promoted coagulation, and deteriorated cardiovascular functions.
- In addition, this combined treatment led to less GSH content, lower GPX and SOD
  activities, greater ROS, IL-6, TNF-alpha and MCP-1 production in heart than either
  TFD or doxorubicin treatment alone.
- These findings indicated that this combination synergistically enhanced cardiac
  oxidative and inflammatory injury.
- It is interesting to find that this combination effectively raised XO activity.
- XO is a powerful oxygen radical-generating source, and inhibition of XO activity
  could improve some biomarkers in patients with cardiovascular diseases (Szasz and
  others 2008; Doehner and Landmesser 2011).
- The raised cardiac XO activity from this combined treatment definitely facilitated
  ROS generation and diminished cardiac antioxidative defense.
- Our data regarding increased LDH and CPK activities, 2 cardiac injury markers, also
  agreed that this combination caused severe cardiotoxicity.
- Furthermore, our data indicated that this combination aggravated the activation
  of NF-κB p65, p-p38, and p-ERK1/2.
- Apparently, TFD plus doxorubicin more efficiently activated NF-κB and MAPK, upstream
  regulatory pathways responsible for the production of oxidative and inflammatory
  factors such as ROS and TNF-alpha.
- These findings suggest that cardio-toxicity from TFD plus doxorubicin could be ascribed
  to the upregulation of both NF-κB and MAPK pathways.
- After calculated and justified, the daily TF consumed by mice in our present study
  was equal to 4 g/d for a 70-kg human male.
- Our results revealed that TFD alone at this dose did not cause severe cardiovascular
  disorder, and was not an effective activator for NF-κB and MAPK pathways.
- It is highly possible that TF intake altered cardiac fatty acid composition, and
  abated antioxidative and anti-inflammatory defense in this tissue.
- Thus, the following use of doxorubicin easily destroyed cardiovascular protective
  system and caused damage.
- These results suggest that TF should be eliminated for patients with doxorubicin
  therapy in order to avoid additively or synergistically oxidative and/or inflammatory
  injury in heart.
- In conclusion, the combination of diet rich in trans fats and doxorubicin enhanced
  cardiac oxidative and inflammatory stress via activating NF-κB and MAPK pathways,
  as well as increasing cardiac generation of ROS, TNF-alpha, and MCP-1.
- This combination also caused hemostatic imbalance.
- These findings support that dietary trans fat promotes doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity.
