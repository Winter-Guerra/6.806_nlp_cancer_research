- Capsaicin has been considered as an alternative template of dichlorodiphenyl trichloroethane
  (DDT) in antifouling paint.
- However, information regarding the estrogenic activity of capsaicin analogues is
  rather limited in comparison to that of DDT analogues and their metabolites.
- We here explore the ER transcription activity of selected capsaicin analogues _via_
  an integrated approach based on _in silico_ prediction and _in vitro_ assays.
- Molecular simulation and the agonist/antagonist differential-docking screening identified
  6-iodonordihydrocapsaicin (6-I-CPS) as a weak ERÎ± agonist, while anti-estrogenicity
  was expected for N-arachidonoyldopamine, capsazepine, dihydrocapsaicin, trichostatin
  A, and capsaicin.
- On the contrary, the large volume of analogues, such as phorbol 12-phenylacetate
  13-acetate 20-homovanillate and phorbol 12,13-dinonanoate 20-homovanillate, cannot
  fit well with the ER cavity.
- The result of MVLN assay was in accord with the _in silico_ prediction.
- 6-I-CPS was demonstrated to induce luciferase gene expression, while the other analogues
  of relatively small molecular volume reduced luciferase gene expression in MVLN
  cells, both in the absence and presence of estradiol.
- This finding suggested that the ER transcription activity of capsaicin analogues
  is generated at least partly through the ERÎ±-mediated pathway.
- Moreover, receptor polymorphism analysis indicated that capsaicin analogues may
  exhibit diverse species selectivity for human beings and marine species.
