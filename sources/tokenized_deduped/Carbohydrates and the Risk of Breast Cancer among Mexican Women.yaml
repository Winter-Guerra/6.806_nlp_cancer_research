- 'OBJECTIVE: High carbohydrate intake has been hypothesized to be a risk factor for
  breast cancer, possibly mediated by elevated levels of free insulin, estrogens,
  and insulin-like growth factor-1.'
- Therefore, we conducted a population-based case-control study among a Mexican population
  characterized by relatively low fat and high carbohydrate intakes.
- 'METHODS: Women ages 20 to 75 years, identified through six hospitals in Mexico
  City (n = 475), were interviewed to obtain data relating to diet (using a food frequency
  questionnaire) and breast cancer risk factors.'
- Controls (n = 1,391) were selected from the Mexico City population using a national
  sampling frame.
- 'RESULTS: Carbohydrate intake was positively associated with breast cancer risk.'
- Compared with women in the lowest quartile of total carbohydrate intake, the relative
  risk of breast cancer for women in the highest quartile was 2.22 [95% confidence
  interval (95% CI) 1.63-3.04], adjusting for total energy and potential confounding
  variables (P for trend &lt; 0.0001).
- This association was present in premenopausal and postmenopausal women (for highest
  versus lowest quartile, odds ratio 2.31, 95% CI 1.36-3.91 in premenopausal women
  and odds ratio 2.22, 95% CI 1.49-3.30 in postmenopausal women).
- Among carbohydrate components, the strongest associations were observed for sucrose
  and fructose.
- No association was observed with total fat intake.
- 'DISCUSSION: In this population, a high percentage of calories from carbohydrate,
  but not from fat, was associated with increased breast cancer risk.'
- This relation deserves to be investigated further, particularly in populations highly
  susceptible to insulin resistance.
