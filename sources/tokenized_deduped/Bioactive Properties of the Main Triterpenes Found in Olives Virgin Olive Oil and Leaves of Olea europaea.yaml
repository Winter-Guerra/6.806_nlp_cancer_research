- Oleanolic acid, maslinic acid, uvaol, and erythrodiol are the main triterpenes present
  in olives, olive tree leaves, and virgin olive oil.
- Their concentration in virgin olive oil depends on the quality of the olive oil
  and the variety of the olive tree.
- These triterpenes are described to present different properties, such as antitumoral
  activity, cardioprotective activity, anti-inflammatory activity, and antioxidant
  protection.
- Olive oil triterpenes are a natural source of antioxidants that could be useful
  compounds for the prevention of multiple diseases related to cell oxidative damage.
- However, special attention has to be paid to the concentrations used, because higher
  concentration may lead to cytotoxic or biphasic effects.
- This work explores all of the bioactive properties so far described for the main
  triterpenes present in virgin olive oil.

  Nowadays there is an increasing interest in healthy eating habits and physical care
  to improve our health and quality of life.'
- In fact, government and educational agencies are trying to re-educate the eating
  habits of the population.
- Mediterranean habits are known to be among the healthiest to improve age-dependent
  vascular activity,(1) and they have proved to be beneficial for several diseases
  such as the metabolic syndrome or coronary heart disease.
- '(2, 3)


  Mediterranean habits include exercising regularly and following the so-called Mediterranean
  diet.'
- This diet consists of bread, cereal, rice, pasta, fruits, and vegetables mainly
  and olive oil as the principal source of fat.
- (4) Virgin olive oil has been described to possess bioactive properties such as
  cardioprotective effects, commonly associated with high levels of monounsaturated
  fatty acids (MUFA),(5) but these effects would not necessarily be promoted by MUFA
  alone.
- Antioxidant and antiatherogenic activities,(6) antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic
  capacities on human cancer cell lines,(7, 8) protection against oxidative DNA damage,(9)
  and anti-inflammatory properties(10) have been described mostly in its minor compounds.
- Virgin olive oil is composed by triacylglycerides and 1–2% of minor components (about
  230 different compounds).
- It can be divided into two fractions, the unsaponifiable fraction, extracted with
  solvents after the saponification of the oil, and the saponifiable fraction.
- In the unsaponifiable fraction of virgin olive oil there are triterpenic alcohols
  and other pentacyclic triterpenes, which together form the main triterpenes of virgin
  olive oil.
- However, very little is known about the activity of this group of compounds, known
  as triterpenes, present in the leaves and skin of olives and in virgin olive oil,
  too.
- (11) In this paper, we summarize the effects of the major triterpenes present in
  virgin olive oil described so far, and the key factors of their action regarding
  their role in the oxidation mechanism of the cell.
- The main triterpenes of virgin olive oil are oleanolic acid, maslinic acid, uvaol,
  and erythrodiol.
- (11) These two hydroxyl pentacyclic triterpene acids (oleanolic and maslinic acid)
  and these two dialcohols (uvaol and erythrodiol) are differentiated according to
  the function present at the C-17 position.
- Maslinic acid has two vicinal hydroxyl groups at the C-2 and C-3 positions, besides
  the carboxyl radical.
- Uvaol and erythrodiol possess two hydroxyl groups in remote positions and are different
  with regard to the methyl group location (Figure 1).
- These triterpenes are found in olive skin and the leaves of olive trees (_Olea europaea_).
- The Picual variety showed the highest content of triterpenes in olives.
- The various types of commercial black and green olives ranged from 460 to 1470 mg/kg
  fruit.
- Natural black olives, not treated with NaOH (which debitters black and green olives
  for commercial treatments), showed concentration &gt;2000 mg/kg in the olive flesh.
- (107) The leaf contains important amounts of oleanolic acid (3.0–3.5% DW), followed
  by maslinic acid and minor levels of erythrodiol and uvaol.
- The content of triterpenoids changes during leaf ontogeny.
- (108) Otherwise, in virgin olive oil, the concentration oscillated between 8.90
  and 112.36 mg/kg.
- (11) Allouche et al.
- concluded that the high variability observed in virgin olive oil triterpenic composition
  was due to genetic factors.
- High triterpenic content was obtained from 4 of the 40 varieties (Lechin de Granada,
  Dolce Agogia, Cornicabra, and Salonenque).
- (11) Other authors point out that the concentration of hydroxyl pentacyclic triterpene
  acids depends on the quality of olive oil.
- (12) Finally, it is recognized that triterpene concentration varies depending on
  the type of cultivation and the handling of olive oil.
- In fact, triterpenes are present in higher concentrations in olive pomace oil than
  in virgin olive oils.
- '(12)


  Figure 1.'
- Chemical structures of oleanolic and maslinic acids and uvaol and erythrodiol dialcohols
  of olive oil.
- Very few papers describe the bioavailability of pentacyclic triterpenes from virgin
  olive oil intake, but some reveal interesting data from bioavailability in humans
  and rats.
- After oral administration of 50 mg/kg to rats, a maximum concentration of 0.29 ±
  0.26 μM was observed at 21 ± 17 min; oleanolic acid was minimally absorbed, with
  an absolute oral bioavailibity of 0.7%.
- (103) In humans, the plasmatic concentrations determined in healthy male volunteers
  after a single oral administration of 40 mg was 26.5 ± 15 nM at 5.2 ± 2.9 h.(104)
  Rada et al.
- (106) show that oleanolic acid and human serum proteins have molecular interactions
  between them, and these serum proteins are known for the important role in the binding
  of basic and neutral drugs.
- These authors demonstrated the formation of complexes between human serum proteins
  and OA.
- Maslinic acid after a single oral administration (50 mg/kg) to rats is absorbed
  in the intestine and reaches the blood, where it is found 10 min after the oral
  administration and can still be detected in plasma after 60 min.
- '(105)



  For uvaol and erythrodiol, we have not found in the literature consulted any reference
  concerning bioavailability.'
- Another important issue is the concentration used by the different authors in all
  of the different studies.
- Sánchez-González et al.
- (109) described an interesting property of maslinic acid, namely, its safety.
- In this paper, authors examined the administration of 50 mg/kg of maslinic acid
  for 28 days and a single oral administration of 1000 mg/kg to mice.
- Their results show that this compound does not produce any adverse effects on the
  variables tested in mice (morbidity, mortality, toxicity, body weight...), suggesting
  its use as a nutraceutical.
- We have to pay attention to the concentrations used with each triterpene because
  Lu et al.
- described another aspect of oleanolic acid, its hepatotoxic effect in mice in a
  dose-dependent manner.
- Oleanolic acid causes body weight loss, inflammation and hepatocellular apoptosis,
  necrosis, and feathery degeneration (indicative of cholestasis)(14) in mice.
- Depending on the concentration used and exposure time, the effect could be contrarily
  adverse or even have a biphasic effect; for example, Allouche et al.
- (6) observed an antithrombotic effect after 10 min of incubation period and a prothrombotic
  effect when the incubation period was prolonged to 20 min, which was attributed
  to alteration of maslinic acid after an extended exposure time with prothrombinase
  complex.
- Marquez-Martin et al.
- showed that the behavior of oleanolic acid and uvaol was suggestive of a biphasic
  response in terms of TNF-α production.
- There was an increase at low concentrations (10 μM) and a decrease at higher ones
  (100 μM).
- (15) Therefore, it seems that depending on the concentration and time used, these
  triterpenes have different effects on body response.
- Consequently, more studies are needed about the bioavailability and metabolism of
  these triterpenes with virgin olive oil and olive ingestion to be able to assess
  the potential effect that they could have with diet intake.
- Future studies should be adapted to the bioavailability concentration found for
  each triterpene; in this way the results obtained could be more reliable.
- In the past years, there have been a growing number of studies focusing on the activity
  of the virgin olive oil triterpenes.
- Antitumoral, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, hepatoprotective, cardioprotective,
  and antimicrobial activities have been recently described.
- (6, 7, 16-19) Here we analyze the different bioactivities of these compounds against
  different diseases and conditions and future possible applications.
- Some of the risk factors of cardiovascular diseases are age, sex, and genetic makeup.
- These are not modifiable, but there are other risk factors that could be altered.
- 'Among the modifiable risk factors the following, among others, should be included:
  levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, levels of low-density lipoprotein
  (LDL) cholesterol, obesity, tobacco, levels of circulating oxidized LDL, hypertension,
  endothelial dysfunction, and oxidative stress, among others.'
- Nowadays, a high number of myocardial heart attacks could be prevented by these
  modifiable factors, which are influenced by the diet.
- (20) The diet followed is responsible, to a greater or lesser extent, for atherosclerosis.
- Atherosclerosis is an oxidative, inflammatory, and thrombotic disease characterized
  by the deposition of lipid and other bloodborne material within the arterial wall
  of almost all vascular territories, which is the prelude to atheroma emergence.
- '(29)


  The connection between high levels of LDL oxidation and the increase in cardiovascular
  disease risk(21-23) and an early event in atherosclerosis has already been described.'
- (24) Several studies interconnect certain foodstuffs and the oxidation process of
  LDL,(25) so that it seems that diet and cardiovascular disease are strongly linked.
- Indeed, at present, diet is considered an important determinant in the prevention
  of cardiovascular diseases.
- (26) In this way, triterpenes may play a key role in decreasing this LDL oxidation
  and, hence, in decreasing cardiovascular disease incidence.
- Oxidation of LDL may play a critical role in the early stages of the disease, whereas
  thrombosis acts at the latest stages, it being one of the fatal clinic consequences
  of this pathology.
- (30) Apart from preventing LDL oxidation, these compounds have been described as
  antiatherogenic, because of the role that the triterpenic diols, uvaol and erythrodiol,
  play in preventing LDL-supporting thrombin generation in vitro.
- (6) Table 1 shows triterpene actions in the different stages of the development
  of cardiovascular disease.
- Table 1.
- 'Bioactive Properties of the Main Triterpenes Found in Olives, Olive Tree Leaves,
  and Virgin Olive Oil in Cardiovascular Disease



  Oleanolic acid was described as playing a protection role against LDL oxidation
  like other triterpenes with the effect of chiosmastic gum (CMG), the most effective
  protecting human LDL oxidation yet known.'
- (27, 28) Thus, oleanolic acid exerts potent antiatherogenic effects independent
  of plasma lipid levels in apolipoprotein E knockout mice.
- (31) Previous studies of isolated oleanolic acid describe its action in preventing
  hypertension and hyperlipidaemia in Dahl salt-sensitive (DSS) rats with genetic
  hypertension.
- In this study, oleanolic acid is described as preventing the development of severe
  hypertension through its potent diuretic–natriuretic–saluretic activity, its direct
  cardiac effect, and its antihyperlipidemic, antioxidant, and hypoglycemic effects
  on DSS rats.
- (37) Other authors show its possible action in inhibiting the progress of fibrosis
  and in decreasing the portal pressure in CCl4-induced portal hypertensive rats,
  which could be related to the increase of eNOS expression and enhancement of nitric
  oxide (NO) level in the liver.
- (38) This prevention of hypertension has also been attributed to the antioxidant
  and nitric oxide releasing action of oleanolic acid.
- (39) Indeed, Rodrı́guez-Rodrı́guez et al.
- showed how oleanolic acid together with erythrodiol was able to promote vasorelaxation
  in aortic rings with endothelium precontracted in rats.
- (40) This effect seemed to be mainly mediated by endothelial production of NO.
- Later, this effect was studied,(41) and oleanolic acid was shown to activate endothelium-dependent
  release of NO and to decrease smooth muscle cell calcium followed by relaxation.
- This oleanolic acid-evoked endothelium-derived NO release was independent of endothelial
  cell calcium and involved phosphoinositide-3-kinase-dependent phosphorylation of
  Akt-Ser(473) followed by phosphorylation of eNOS-Ser(1177).
- Oleanolic acid is also involved in atherosclerosis protection also, with antihyperlipidemic
  effects in Wistar rats, decreasing hepatic expression levels of lipogenic genes,
  and several cytochrome P450 genes.
- '(32)



  Maslinic acid strongly inhibits in vitro LDL oxidation.'
- (6) However, maslinic acid showed both pro- and antithrombotic effects depending
  on the concentration used.
- (6) Thus, special attention has to be paid to the concentration of these compounds
  employed, because depending on that, the effects could change, which has been already
  described above.
- Another cardioprotective activity described for maslinic acid was its effect on
  isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarcted albino Wistar rats; maslinic acid reduced
  the effects of isoproterenol on body weight, heart weight, lipids, lipoproteins,
  lipid peroxidation, cardiac marker enzymes, and paraoxonase,(33) so it that seems
  maslinic acid has cardioprotective effects, influencing more than one pathway.
- Consequently, maslinic acid may act both at the beginning and at the latest stage
  of atherosclerosis.
- Indeed, it has been described that this compound has been shown to be involved in
  atherosclerosis protection, with potential antioxidant and hypoglycemic effects
  by reducing insulin resistance in a mouse model of genetic type-2 diabetes.
- (32) However, more studies are needed to evaluate the precise mechanism of action
  of these compounds in atherosclerosis prevention.
- The action of erythrodiol and uvaol in reducing cardiac hypertrophy and left ventricle
  remodeling induced by angiotensin II in mice, through diminishing fibrosis and myocite
  area, has been recently described.
- They seem to modulate growth and survival of cardiac myofibroblasts, and both of
  them inhibit the angiotensin II-induced proliferation in a PPAR-γ-dependent manner,
  whereas at high doses they activate pathways of programmed cell death that are dependent
  on JNK and PPAR-γ.
- '(42)


  There are several studies on olive pomace oil, which has high triterpenic content,
  and on its improvement of the endothelial function,(34-36) so it seems reasonable
  to conclude that these compounds could have an active role in cardiovascular prevention.'
- In view of the actions described above, virgin olive oil triterpenes could have
  an interesting therapeutic potential as cardiovascular drugs, and furthermore they
  may fulfill a role in preventing, through diet, different kinds of cardiovascular
  disorders.
- Although more evidence will be necessary to identify the mechanism involved and
  their interactions, it will be necessary to determine the most effective dose and
  exposure time for treatments.
- A diversity of studies highlight different aspects of the function that triterpenes
  seem to play in cancer.
- So far, it is clear that triterpenes affect tumorigenesis and key factors for its
  development, such as angiogenesis.
- (43) Apart from this, various studies note the antitumor activities of triterpenes
  in different cancers such as hepatocellular carcinoma, skin cancer, colon cancer,
  lung cancer, breast cancer, myelogenous leukemia, and pancreatic cancer.
- '(7, 13, 44-49)


  In this line, the antiangiogenic effects of oleanolic and maslinic acids in human
  liver cancer cell lines have been studied.'
- In a dose-dependent manner they reduced cell invasion and migration, decreasing
  reactive oxygen species (ROS) and NO levels and decreasing expression of vascular
  endothelial growth factor (VEGF).
- (43) In Table 2 the kinds of action exerted by each triterpene in the different
  types of cancer studied are specified.
- Table 2.
- 'Bioactive Properties of the Main Triterpenes Found in Olives, Olive Tree Leaves,
  and Virgin Olive Oil in Cancer


  Several studies have focused on the antitumoral activity of these triterpenes in
  the synthesis of new molecules derived from them and assessed their roles as anticancer
  drugs.'
- '(50-52)



  The mechanism of action of oleanolic acid has been studied in different types of
  cancer cells.'
- On hepatocellular carcinoma, oleanolic acid exhibited inhibitory effects through
  induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest.
- (44, 53) Apoptosis was induced through the mitochondrial pathway, and this could
  be due to ROS generated by mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation.
- Wei et al.
- also described the arrest of cell cycle and induction of apoptosis in human pancreatic
  cancer cell line (Panc-28) by ROS-mediated mitochondrial depolarization and lysosomal
  membrane permeabilization.
- (54) Apoptosis was also induced in several cancer cell lines, including multidrug
  resistance cancer cells, non-small-cell lung cancer cell lines, lung adenocarcinoma,
  B16F10 melanoma cells, breast cancer, and colon cancer by oleanolic acid.
- This compound activates caspase-3, decreases the expression of Bcl-2 antiapoptotic
  gene, and increases the expression of pro-apoptotic protein Bax.
- Along with this, oleanolic acid is capable of decreasing angiogenic VEGF and decreasing
  the development of melanoma-induced lung metastasis of the B16F10 melanoma model
  in vivo.
- (7, 47, 48, 55-58) In osteosarcoma cells, oleanolic acid inhibits proliferation
  and colony formation, induces G1 arrest, and promotes apoptosis, through mTOR signaling,
  a central regulator of cell growth, proliferation, survival, and metabolism.
- '(59)



  Recent studies report the chemopreventive potential of maslinic acid in colorectal
  cancer in vitro(46) and in vivo.'
- (60) This compound has not been as thoroughly studied as oleanolic acid in cancer,
  but there is increasing interest in the preventive action that it seems to possess.
- Hsum et al.
- studied the chemopreventive action that maslinic acid showed in Raji cells.
- It suppressed COX-2 expression and inhibited NF-κB and AP-1 binding activities.
- (61) Targeting pro-inflammatory pathways by dietary phytochemicals as a strategy
  for cancer prevention is one of the current issues studied, but at a later stage,
  inflammation and triterpene action will also be discussed.
- One aspect of cancer development is the metastatic potential of the tumor.
- Many authors have recently studied the antimetastatic activity of maslinic acid
  in DU145 human prostate cancer cells and its mediation via hypoxia-inducible factor-1α
  signaling (HIF-1α).
- (62) In these cancer cells, maslinic acid acts by inhibiting uPAR, E-cadherin, VEGF,
  and matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) expression and dramatically reduces the levels
  of HIF-1α.
- Consequently, maslinic acid inhibits the migration, invasion, and adhesion of DU145
  prostate cancer cells.
- As oleanolic, this acid induces apoptosis in specific cancer cell lines.
- '(63-67) In some of them, maslinic acid promotes apoptosis by a mechanism similar
  to the one of oleanolic acid: a JNK-p53-dependent mechanism, the mitochondrial apoptotic
  pathway, the increase of expression of Bid and Bax, repression of Bcl-2, release
  of cytochrome _c_, and increase in caspase-9, -3, and -7 expression.'
- Another potential antitumor activity of maslinic acid is its enhancement of the
  antitumor activity of TNF-α by suppressing NF-κB action and downstream gene expression,
  apart from activating the caspase-dependent apoptotic pathway.
- '(68)



  The two dialcohols of olive oil have been targeted for research in recent years.'
- It was in 1976 when uvaol was first described to possess tumor inhibitory effects,
  along with ursolic acid and betulinic acid.
- (69) Until 1994, there were not any additional studies on the effects of any of
  these compounds.
- Then, Es-Saady et al.
- described uvaol, ursolic acid, and oleanolic acid inhibition in leukemic cell line
  proliferation.
- '(70)


  Erythrodiol effects on skin tumor formation in mice were described in 1988,(71)
  and until 2008, no author had described its cytotoxic effect.'
- (72) Since then, several works have described uvaol and erythrodiol antitumoral
  effects in murine and human cancer cell lines.
- '(7, 73-76) The most remarkable effect of both is their pro-apoptotic potential,
  which they exert in two different ways: associated with ROS and by c-Jun N-terminal
  kinase JNK activation.'
- (7, 74, 76) Again, it seems clear that ROS are crucial in the mechanism of action
  of these four compounds.
- Inflammation is related to several diseases, for example, as a prelude for cancer
  development and interrelating different kinds of cells for the development of a
  response to a trauma or strange antigen.
- Virgin olive oil triterpenes have been recently studied for the modulation that
  they exert in the inflammatory response.
- Oleanolic acid has been described as an anti-inflammatory molecule in vivo(77-79)
  and in vitro.
- (80, 81) This compound promotes an anti-inflammatory status inhibiting the activation
  of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and the production of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)
  in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs).
- (82) The suppressive effect of triterpenes in the activation of NF-κB seems to be
  extensive to the four triterpenes in different types of cells.
- (61, 80, 81, 83) It has been described that the efficient activation of NF-κB-dependent
  genes by TNF-α requires a cell to be in an oxidized redox state, suggesting that
  stimuli such as TNF may exert only a limited response if the cell is not in an appropriate
  redox equilibrium;(84) thus, the link between ROS generation and activation of the
  NF-κB pathway seems to be recognizable.
- (85) Most studies focus on the role that triterpenes could play against certain
  diseases, their apoptotic role against tumor cells, or the protective action in
  vascular alteration, but a principal feature of these compounds is their antioxidant
  effect (Figure 2).
- The chemical antioxidant role of the triterpenic fraction of virgin olive oil is
  well documented, although the free radical scavenging activity is almost absent
  in oleanolic acid, uvaol, and erythrodiol.
- Maslinic acid also exhibited a weak antiradical activity up to 800 μM and 2.50 mol
  ratio, but up to 5.00 mol a high DPPH scavenging activity was observed.
- (7) It acts as an efficient peroxyl radical scavenger by the ORAC assay.
- '(6)


  Balanehru et al.'
- described the protection offered by oleanolic acid, isolated from _Eugenia jumbolana_,
  against hepatic microsome lipid peroxidation in rats.
- (86) Maslinic acid was described to prevent hepatocyte membrane from lipid peroxidation
  in rats, induced by the hydroxyl radical (OH).
- (87) According to this, some authors tried to study this prevention of lipid peroxidation
  in hepatic microsomes of rats that were fed, for 3 weeks, high-oleic-acid oils (of
  sunflower oil, olive oil, and olive pomace oil) containing different concentrations
  of the antioxidants α-tocopherol, erythrodiol, and oleanolic acid.
- They concluded that oleanolic acid and erythrodiol protect against, at least partly,
  microsomal lipid peroxidation in rats fed olive pomace oil.
- '(88)


  Oxidative stress and inflammation are closely related, not only because of the NF-κB
  pathway but also on account of other signals such as ROS and reactive nitrogen species
  (RNS) produced by macrophages and other mediated immune cells.'
- With this signal, macrophages activate other immune cells that, with them, will
  try to mediate inflammation and revert to the initial health status.
- In this way, any compound that acts directly or indirectly in oxidative stress will
  act in inflammation and, thereby, in the prelude of several diseases.
- According to this, oleanolic acid has been one of the triterpenes most studied in
  inflammation and oxidative stress.
- This compound is an effective inhibitor of cyclo-oxygenase (COX) and of 5-lipoxygenase
  (5-LOX),(89) both present in the arachidonic acid synthesis pathway.
- The anti-inflammatory effects of suppressing COX-2 action, like the reduction of
  several pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α, are well-known.
- Other studies in PC12 cells show the influence of oleanolic acid in reducing subsequent
  H2O2\- or MMP+-induced cell death and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, which
  leads to alleviated oxidative stress in PC12 cells H2O2\- or MMP+-induced injury.
- It spares GSH, raising the activity of SOD and catalase and reducing the release
  of IL-6 and TNF-α.
- (93, 94) Another antioxidant effect of oleanolic acid was studied by Tsai et al.
- (95) The study was undertaken in mouse brain, where, dose-dependently, oleanolic
  acid diminished ROS and proteins related with oxidative stress, showing neuroprotective
  effects in vivo.
- COX-2 and inducible nitric oxide synthethase (iNOS) expression are suppressed at
  protein and mRNA levels by maslinic acid, and likewise in the translocation of NF-κB
  to the nucleus (and IκBα phosphorylation), in a concentration-dependent manner in
  cultured cortical astrocytes.
- (90) These last actions (reduction of IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α) are produced by maslinic
  acid in mouse macrophages(91) and by the four triterpenic compounds of olive oil
  in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells.
- (15) These authors observed that maslinic acid significantly inhibits the enhanced
  production of NO induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), measured by the nitrite production
  with an IC50 value of 25.4 μM.
- This seems to be in correlation with an action in the iNOS gene expression rather
  than a direct inhibitory effect on the enzyme activity.
- ROS were reduced in a dose-dependent manner (IC50 = 43.6 μM) showing a preventive
  effect in oxidative stress in murine macrophages.
- The inhibition of NO production by oleanolic and maslinic acid was described by
  Yang et al.
- in murine RAW 264.7 cells.
- (92) In breast cancer cells ROS production was decreased by uvaol, oleanolic acid,
  and maslinic acid.
- '(7)


  Interestingly, triterpenes are capable of protecting against H2O2-induced DNA damage
  in several leukemic(96) and human breast cancer cell lines.'
- (7) There are not many studies about antioxidant effects of triterpenes in DNA damage,
  but attending to the effects observed in different types of cells on oxidative stress,
  and with these previous studies in leukemic and breast cancer cell lines, probably
  these triterpenic acids and dialcohols play an important role in the oxidative stress
  mechanism of the cell, even at nucleus level, protecting against oxidative damage
  to DNA.
- Because of that, these olive oil triterpenes could be a good option for preventing
  different diseases related with oxidative stress, such as cardiovascular diseases,(97)
  cancer,(98) or even Parkinson’s disease(99) and Alzheimer’s disease.
- '(100, 101)


  Another potentially interesting role of triterpenes is their predictable antioxidant
  capacity in aging.'
- Aging is associated with the accumulation of inactive or less active forms of numerous
  enzymes.
- The possibility that these age-related changes are due, at least in part, to oxidative
  modification is indicated by Berlett et al.
- (102) There is no scientific evidence of the action of these compounds in the oxidative
  modification of a protein, but they are modulators of the proteic activity in the
  cell and could protect against the loss of their activity or oxidative modification;
  additional studies are required to ensure this.
- Oleanolic acid, maslinic acid, uvaol, and erythrodiol are the main triterpenes found
  in virgin olive oil, but they are not present in other edible oils.
- They appear in olive leaves and olive skin, and their concentrations depend on the
  variety selected and the culture handling.
- These triterpenes possess antioxidant properties per se, and in different cellular
  types, they affect some central proteins of oxidative stress and inflammation (NF-κB
  and COX-2); it is still unknown what actual pathways they affect and how.
- Although the origins of the diseases described above are varied, oxidative stress
  is a common condition in them.
- Compounds that protect against oxidative stress may be useful to prevent these diseases.
- As we have already showed, triterpenes exert a protective role against oxidant environment,
  regulating it or, even more, diminishing it.
- Therefore, the main triterpenes of virgin olive oil could have a critical role in
  preventing a group of several diseases related with oxidative stress, such as cancer
  or cardiovascular disease.
- More bioavailability studies about these triterpenes are needed to obtain reliable
  information about the range in which they are present in the cellular metabolism.
- Taking into account all available scientific evidence, the beneficial effects of
  the major triterpenes present in virgin olive oil could prevent certain diseases.
- For all of these reasons, more studies on the mechanism of action of these triterpenes
  in oxidative stress are required; indeed, these studies could probe the potential
  role of triterpenes in preventing the appearance of different diseases.
- This study was financially supported by the Junta de Andalucı́a (Proyecto de Excelencia
  PI10-AGR-6724) and supported by grants from the University of Jaén (Plan de Apoyo
  a la Investigación-Acción 16).
