- We showed previously that garden cress constituent benzyl isothiocyanate (BITC)
  inhibits self-renewal of breast cancer stem cells (bCSC) in vitro and in vivo.
- The present study offers novel insights into the mechanism by which BITC inhibits
  bCSC.
- Flow cytometry and mammosphere assay were performed to quantify bCSC fraction.
- Protein expression was determined by western blotting.
- Apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry using Annexin V-propidium iodide method.
- Cell migration was determined by Boyden chamber assay.
- BITC treatment resulted in a marked decrease in protein level of polycomb group
  protein B-lymphoma Moloney murine leukemia virus insertion region-1 (Bmi-1) in cultured
  human breast cancer cells (MCF-7, SUM159, MDA-MB-231, and MDA-MB-361) and MDA-MB-231
  xenografts in vivo.
- Overexpression (MCF-7) or knockdown (SUM159, and MDA-MB-231) of Bmi-1 protein had
  no meaningful impact on the BITC’s ability to inhibit cell viability and cell migration
  and/or induce apoptosis.
- On the other hand, inhibition of bCSC markers (aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 activity
  and mammosphere frequency) resulting from BITC exposure was significantly altered
  by Bmi-1 overexpression and knockdown.
- BITC was previously shown to cause activation of Notch1, Notch2, and Notch4 in association
  with induction of γ-secretase complex component Nicastrin, which are also implicated
  in maintenance of cancer stemness.
- BITC-mediated inhibition of bCSC was augmented by knockdown of Notch4 and Nicastrin,
  but not by RNA interference of Notch1 or Notch2.
- The present study highlights important roles for Bmi-1 and Notch4 in BITC-mediated
  suppression of bCSC.
- Search for non-toxic interventions to delay onset and/or progression of breast cancer
  continues mainly because most of the risk factors associated with this neoplasm
  are not easily modifiable and the currently available clinical options [e.g., selective
  estrogen receptor (ER) modulators] target only a subset of the disease [1, 2].
- Despite a comprehensive understanding of the genomic landscape and the biology of
  the breast cancer [3, 4] this malignancy still accounts for &gt;40,000 deaths each
  year in the United States alone [5].
- An emerging paradigm suggests that elimination of tumor-initiating cells (also known
  as breast cancer stem cells; bCSC) as well as the transformed cells constituting
  bulk of the tumor mass may be necessary for successful prevention and treatment
  of breast cancer [6, 7].
- The bCSC are implicated in initiation, maintenance, and metastatic spread of breast
  cancers [6, 7].
- Phytochemicals present in our daily diet as well as in certain medicinal plants
  are attractive for cancer prevention [8, 9].
- Benzyl isothiocyanate (BITC), an electrophilic compound in edible cruciferous vegetables,
  is one such phytochemical with compelling preclinical evidence for its efficacy
  against breast cancer [10].
- Higher intake of broccoli, a member of the cruciferous vegetable family, is suggested
  to decrease the risk of breast cancer in premenopausal women [11].
- BITC administration was associated with inhibition of chemically induced breast
  cancer in experimental animals [12].
- BITC has the ability to retard in vivo growth of mammary tumor xenografts in mice
  [13, 14].
- For example, the primary tumor growth and pulmonary metastasis of 4T1 mammary carcinoma
  cells implanted into the mammary fat pads of female syngeneic BALB/c mice was significantly
  retarded by oral administration of 5 and 10 mg BITC/kg body weight/day for 32 days
  [14].
- Moreover, the inhibitory effect was relatively more pronounced on lung metastasis
  than on primary tumors [14].
- Work from our own laboratory has established mammary cancer chemopreventive efficacy
  of BITC (1 and 3 mmol BITC/kg diet for 25 weeks) in mouse mammary tumor virus-_neu_
  transgenic mice [15].
- More recent work from our laboratory has demonstrated in vitro and in vivo suppression
  of bCSC fraction upon treatment with BITC [16].
- However, the molecular mechanism underlying BITC-mediated inhibition of bCSC is
  still not fully understood.
- The present study was designed to determine the role of B-lymphoma Moloney murine
  leukemia virus insertion region-1 (Bmi-1) and the Notch receptors, which have emerged
  as regulators of bCSC self-renewal and maintenance [17–19], in bCSC inhibition by
  BITC.
- For instance, the Notch4 activity was shown to be eight-fold higher in bCSC-enriched
  populations compared with differentiated breast cancer cells [18].
- A role for Notch1 in expansion of bCSC was also suggested very recently [20].
- The effect of BITC on Bmi-1 expression is not known, but this compound was previously
  shown to cause activation of Notch1, Notch2, and Notch4 in a panel of human breast
  cancer cells [21].
- Fresh-frozen MDA-MB-231 tumor xenograft specimens from control and BITC-treated
  mice from our previous study [13] were used to determine the in vivo effect of BITC
  administration on expression of Bmi-1 protein.
- Use of mice and their care was in accordance with the University of Pittsburgh Institutional
  Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines.
- BITC (purity &gt;98 %) was purchased from LKT laboratories (St. Paul, MN) and dissolved
  in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).
- Regents for cell culture were from Invitrogen-Life Technologies (Grand Island, NY).
- Antibodies against Bmi-1, cleaved Notch1, and Nicastrin were from Cell Signaling
  Technology (Danvers, MA); anti-β-actin and anti-Notch4 antibodies were from Sigma-Aldrich
  (St. Louis, MO); and anti-cleaved Notch 2 antibody was from EMD Millipore (Billerica,
  MA).
- Small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeted against Bmi-1, Notch1, Notch2, Notch4, and
  Nicastrin, were acquired from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Dallas, TX), whereas a nonspecific
  control siRNA was purchased from Qiagen (Germantown, MD).
- Annexin V-FITC apoptosis detection kit was purchased from BD Biosciences (San Jose,
  CA).
- The Bmi-1-targeted small hairpin RNA (shRNA) and control shRNA were from Santa Cruz
  Biotechnology.
- The MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, and MDA-MB-361 cells were purchased from the American Type
  Culture collection (Manassas, VA).
- SUM159 cell line was purchased from Asterand (Detroit, MI).
- MCF-7 cells were stably transfected with empty pcDNA3.1 vector or the same vector
  encoding for Bmi-1 using FuGENE6.
- The pcDNA3.1-Bmi-1 plasmid was a generous gift form Dr. M. H. Yang (National Yang-Ming
  University, Taipei, Taiwan).
- Cells stably overexpressing Bmi-1 were generated by 8-week culture in medium containing
  1 mg/mL of G418.
- SUM159 cells were stably transfected with 2 µg of control shRNA or Bmi-1-targeted
  shRNA using transfection medium and reagents from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.
- SUM159 clone with stable knockdown of Bmi-1 was selected with 1.5 µg/mL of Puromycin
  over a 4-week period.
- Preparation of cell lysates and xenograft supernatants and the details of western
  blotting have been described by us previously [22, 23].
- The effect of BITC on cell viability was ascertained after 72 h treatment by MTS
  method using reagents from Promega (Madison, WI) according to the supplier’s instructions
  or trypan blue dye exclusion assay as described previously [22].
- Apoptotic fraction was quantified by flow cytometry after staining with Annexin
  V/propidium iodide as described by us previously [24].
- Cell migration was determined as described by us previously [21] using Transwell
  Boyden chambers from Corning (New York, NY) containing 8-µm polycarbonate filter.
- The ALDH1 activity was determined using ALDEFLUORTM assay kit from STEMCELL Technologies
  (Vancouver, BC).
- Supplier’s protocol was followed for ALDH1 activity assay.
- Mammosphere formation assay was performed as described by us previously [16] with
  the exception that the culture medium was supplemented with 0.9 % methylcellulose
  to reduce cell aggregation.
- Briefly, one thousand cells were plated in ultralow attachment plates from Corning
  in medium containing penicillin/streptomycin, B27, insulin, hydrocortisone, epidermal
  growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor, 2-mercaptoethanol, and methylcellulose.
- Desired concentrations of BITC or DMSO (control) were then added to the plates.
- After a 5-day (MCF-7) or 7-day (SUM159) incubation, the mammospheres were scored
  under an inverted microscope.
- Cells were transfected at 50–60 % confluence with control (nonspecific siRNA) or
  desired siRNA (100–200 nM) for 24 h. The cells were then treated with DMSO or BITC
  and used for various assays.
- 'For each experiment, statistical comparisons were performed to answer two specific
  questions: (a) whether overexpression or knockdown of a desired protein itself affected
  cellular phenotype (e.g., cell viability, apoptosis, migration, or bCSC fraction),
  and (b) if BITC-mediated inhibition of a given phenotype was affected by overexpression
  or knockdown of the desired protein.'
- Statistically significant differences addressing only these questions are shown
  in figures.
- We used a panel of human breast cancer cells (MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-361, and
  SUM159) representing major subtypes and pharmacologically relevant BITC concentrations
  [25, 26] to study its effect treatment on Bmi-1 protein level.
- The western blots shown in Fig.
- 1a revealed downregulation of Bmi-1 protein level after treatment with BITC in each
  cell line, although cell line-specific differences were also discernible.
- For example, BITC-mediated suppression of Bmi-1 protein level was clearly evident
  at all three time points and at both drug concentrations in MCF-7 cells (Fig.
- 1a).
- In contrast, downregulation of Bmi-1 protein expression post-BITC treatment was
  observed only at 48 h (40–60 % decrease) and 72 h-time points (60–70 % decrease)
  in MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig.
- 1a).

  Consistent with cellular results (Fig.'
- 1a), inhibition of MDA-MB-231 xenograft growth in vivo after BITC administration
  [13] was accompanied by a decrease in Bmi-1 protein level (Fig.
- 1b).
- Bmi-1 expression was visually obvious in 4 of 5 MDA-MB-231 xenografts from the control
  group (Fig.
- 1b).
- The reason for variability in Bmi-1 protein level in control xenografts is unclear,
  but its expression was barely detectable in each MDA-MB-231 xenograft from the BITC
  treatment group.
- Collectively, these results indicated that the BITC-mediated downregulation of Bmi-1
  protein was neither cell line-specific nor restricted to cultured breast cancer
  cells.
- In agreement with published data [27], overexpression of Bmi-1 protein (Fig.
- 1c) led to a significant (1.6-fold) increase in MCF-7 cell viability (Fig.
- 1d).
- In addition, Bmi-1-overexpressing MCF-7 cells exhibited a modest but statistically
  significant resistance to cell viability inhibition by BITC (Fig.
- 1d).
- In sharp contrast to MCF-7 cells [27], viability of SUM159 cells was not affected
  by stable knockdown of Bmi-1 protein (Fig.
- 1c, d).
- Furthermore, SUM159 cells stably transfected with the control shRNA and the Bmi-1-targeted
  shRNA were equally sensitive to BITC-mediated inhibition of cell viability.
- Consistent with these results, cell viability inhibition by BITC was not affected
  by knockdown of Bmi-1 protein (&gt;90 % knockdown) by transient transfection with
  siRNA in either SUM159 or MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig.
- 1e).
- Similarly, cell viability inhibition by BITC, determined by trypan blue dye exclusion
  assay, was not affected by RNA interference of Bmi-1 at least in SUM159 cells (results
  not shown).
- These results indicated cell line-specific role for Bmi-1 in regulation of cell
  viability.
- Breast cancer growth retardation upon treatment with BITC is accompanied by apoptosis
  induction in vitro and in vivo [15, 28].
- Even though the published literature on the role of Bmi-1 in regulation of apoptosis
  is ambiguous [27, 29], we were tempted to test if the proapoptotic response to BITC
  was affected by overexpression or knockdown of Bmi-1 protein.
- Figure 2a shows early (Annexin Vhigh and propidium iodidelow) and late apoptotic
  fraction (Annexin Vhigh and propidium iodidehigh) in MCF-7 and SUM159 cells after
  24 h treatment with DMSO or BITC.
- The basal apoptosis was not affected by stable overexpression (MCF-7) or stable
  knockdown (SUM159) of the Bmi-1 protein (Fig.
- 2a).
- With the exception of a modest attenuation of cell death induction at the higher
  BITC dose in MCF-7 cells, the proapoptotic effect of this agent was generally not
  affected by alteration of Bmi-1 expression (Fig.
- 2b).
- Our interpretation of these results is that Bmi-1 is largely dispensable for apoptosis
  induction by BITC.
- Bmi-1 is largely dispensable for BITC-induced apoptosis or cell migration inhibition.

  Overexpression of Bmi-1 protein in immortalized human mammary epithelial cells was
  previously shown to increase cell migration, whereas a decrease in propensity for
  migration of MDA-MB-435S cancerous breast cells was discernible after its knockdown
  [30].'
- Even though stable knockdown of Bmi-1 protein resulted in a modest decrease in SUM159
  cell migration, the difference was insignificant (Fig.
- 2c, d).
- Nevertheless, the extent of cell migration inhibition by BITC was comparable in
  sh-control and sh-Bmi-1 cells (Fig.
- 2d).
- Because of incomplete knockdown of the protein using Bmi-1-targeted shRNA (Fig.
- 1c), we carried out experiments using a Bmi-1-targeted siRNA (Fig.
- 3).
- BITC-mediated inhibition of MDA-MB-231 (Fig.

  Two independent assays, including ALDH1 activity determination and mammosphere formation,
  were performed to explore potential involvement of Bmi-1 in BITC-mediated suppression
  of bCSC activity.'
- Figure 4a shows flow histograms for ALDH1 activity with or without treatment with
  BITC or ALDH1 inhibitor diethylaminobenzaldehyde (DEAB).
- The ALDH1 activity was increased by about 2.3-fold upon overexpression of Bmi-1
  itself in MCF-7 cells (Fig.
- 4b).
- Treatment of empty vector-transfected MCF-7 cells with 1 μM BITC for 72 h led to
  a 37 % decrease in ALDH1 activity compared with DMSO control, but the difference
  was not significant (Fig.
- 4b).
- A decrease of only about 10 % (non-significant) in ALDH1 activity was observed by
  a similar treatment in MCF-7 cell stably overexpressing Bmi-1 in comparison with
  DMSO control (Fig.
- 4b).
- The difference in ALDH1 activity between BITC-treated empty vector and BITC-treated
  Bmi-1-overexpressing cells was significant (Fig.
- 4b).
- The ALDH1 activity was decreased by about 56 % after knockdown of Bmi-1 protein
  (_P_ &lt; 0.05) in SUM159 cells (Fig.
- 4b).
- BITC treatment resulted in a 38 % decrease in ALDH1 activity in SUM159 cells stably
  transfected with control shRNA (_P_ &lt; 0.05).
- In addition, the BITC-mediated inhibition of ALDH1 activity was augmented by Bmi-1
  knockdown in SUM159 cells (_P_ &lt; 0.05) (Fig.

  Figure 5a depicts primary mammospheres resulting after 5 days (MCF-7) or 7 days

- Quantitation of mammospheres revealed 1.9-fold enrichment in MCF-7 cells after Bmi-1
  overexpression (_P_ &lt; 0.05) (Fig.

- Mammosphere number was decreased by 47 % (_P_ &lt; 0.05) after BITC treatment in

  The transcription factors belonging to the Notch family, especially Notch1 and Notch4
  have emerged as critical mediators of stemness in breast cancer [18, 20].'
- At the same time, a tumor suppressor role for Notch2 has also been suggested in
  breast cancer cells [31].
- Our own previous work has revealed that BITC treatment increases levels of cleaved
  Notch1, Notch2, and Notch4 leading to transcriptional activation of Notch in a panel
  of human breast cancer cells, including MCF-7 and SUM159 cell lines [21].
- Furthermore, the BITC-mediated activation of Notch was accompanied by induction
  of γ-secretase complex component Nicastrin [21].
- Therefore, it was of interest to test whether anti-bCSC effect of BITC was compromised
  due to Notch activation.
- A series of RNA interference studies were conducted using MCF-7 cells to explore
  this possibility.
- RNA interference of Notch2 (Fig.
- 6a) decreased ALDH1 activity (Fig.
- 6b), but BITC elicited more or less similar response in cells transfected with control
  siRNA and Notch1 or Notch2 siRNA (Fig.
- 6c).
- RNA interference of Notch4 resulted in 60–90 % decrease in its protein level in
  MCF-7 and SUM159 cells (Fig.
- 7a).
- In MCF-7 cells, the ALDH1 activity was statistically significantly inhibited by
  BITC treatment (Fig.
- 7b) as well as by Notch4 knockdown alone (Fig.
- 7b, c, left panel).
- The overall pattern was the same in SUM159 cells, but the difference did not reach
  significance for Notch4 knockdown alone compared with cells transfected with control
  siRNA (Fig.
- 7c, right panel).
- In both cells, however, BITC-mediated inhibition of ALDH1 activity was statistically
  significantly augmented by Notch4 knockdown (Fig.
- '7c: compare 2nd and 4th columns).'
- We next explored whether activation of Notch4 was affected by Bmi-1 status.
- As can be seen in Fig.
- 7d, Notch4 activation was marginally affected by overexpression (MCF-7) and knockdown
  of Bmi-1 (SUM159).

  The role of the polycomb group protein Bmi-1 in regulation of cell viability or
  apoptosis is not fully understood.'
- One study showed a decrease in cell viability in MCF-7 cells after knockdown of
  the Bmi-1 protein [27].
- The present study reveals that while Bmi-1 expression affects MCF-7 cell viability
  (Fig.
- 1d), this relationship is not obvious in SUM159 or MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig.
- 1e).
- Thus, the association of Bmi-1 expression level with cell viability seems unique
  to MCF-7 cells.
- This scenario is partially supported by the literature data showing no effect of
  Bmi-1 knockdown on viability of MDA-MB-435S cells [30].
- Nevertheless, the present study reveals that the Bmi-1 expression has marginal impact
  on BITC’s ability to inhibit viability or induce apoptotic cell death in cells other
  than MCF-7.
- We also found no meaningful impact of Bmi-1 knockdown on SUM159 cell migration.
- The present study shows that overexpression of Bmi-1 confers protection against
  bCSC inhibition by BITC in MCF-7 cells.
- In agreement with these results, bCSC inhibition by BITC is augmented by Bmi-1 knockdown
  in SUM159 and MDA-MB-231 cells.
- Bmi-1 can cause mammary epithelial cells to evade senescence leading to immortalization
  [33].
- High Bmi-1 expression in human breast cancer specimens correlates with clinical
  and pathologic classification.
- Immunohistochemical analysis of Bmi-1 in breast tumors suggests that its expression
  is an independent prognostic factor associated with basal-like phenotype and poor
  survival [34].
- Even though examples also exist arguing against the association of high Bmi-1 expression
  with unfavorable prognosis in breast cancer [35], the results shown herein indicate,
  for the first time, that Bmi-1 is a novel target of bCSC inhibition by BITC.
- We also propose that Bmi-1 suppression may represent a viable pharmacodynamic biomarker
  of BITC exposure because the expression of Bmi-1 is decreased after BITC treatment
  both in vitro and in vivo.
- The present study building upon our previous findings [21] highlights that the activation
  of Notch4 by BITC attenuates its inhibitory effect on bCSC activity.
- Knockdown of γ-secretase complex component Nicastrin also augments bCSC inhibition
  by BITC.
- However, a similar relationship is not observed for Notch1 and Notch2 despite their
  activation by BITC [21].
- The mechanism by which Notch4 regulates bCSC activity is not fully understood, but
  interaction with peptidyl-prolyl isomerase Pin1 leading to escape from proteasomal
  degradation has been observed in human breast cancer cells [36].
- We are tempted to speculate that mammary cancer prevention by BITC is likely augmented
  by a combination regimen involving Notch4 inhibitor, but validation of this hypothesis
  requires investigation.
- In summary, data shown herein indicate that (a) BITC decreases expression of Bmi-1
  protein in vitro; (b) expression of Bmi-1 protein is decreased in vivo after BITC
  administration to MDA-MB-231 xenograft bearing athymic mice; (c) Bmi-1 is largely
  dispensable for BITC-mediated inhibition of cell viability and migration; (d) BITC’s
  ability to induce apoptosis in human breast cancer cells is not altered by Bmi-1
  expression level; (e) Bmi-1 plays an important role in bCSC inhibition by BITC;
  and (f) Notch4 activation by BITC hinders its inhibitory effect on bCSC.
