- To explore the antitumor effect of caffeic acid 3,4-dihydroxy-phenethyl ester (CADPE)
  on the breast cancer cell lines and illuminate the related mechanism.
- After treatment with different concentrations of CADPE for 24, 48, and 72 h, cell
  proliferation ability of the breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435
  was analyzed by the MTT.
- Changes of the cell cycles were evaluated by PI staining.
- Cell apoptosis was examined by flow cytometry after Annexin V/7AAD double staining.
- Nuclear morphologic changes were observed under the inverted fluorescence microscope
  after staining with Hoechst 33342.
- Mitochondrial membrane potential and reactive oxygen species (ROS) level were estimated
  by JC-1 and DCFH-DA staining.
- In addition, the expression level of mitochondrial signaling pathway proteins Bcl-2,
  Bax, and caspase-3 were evaluated by Western blot.
- CADPE has the distinct cytotoxic effect to the breast cancer cells, and the effect
  is dose dependent.
- It did not change the cell cycles but induced the cell apoptosis of the breast cancer
  cells.
- At the same time, after CADPE treatment, the expression levels of caspase-3 and
  Bax in the breast cancer cells were upregulated and Bcl-2 expression was declined.
- The ROS level in the breast cancer cells was enhanced, and mitochondrial membrane
  potential of the cells was downregulated.
- CADPE has the antitumor functions.
- It can induce the cell apoptosis through downregulating Bcl-2 expression, enhancing
  Bax and caspase-3 expression levels, upregulating ROS level and reducing the mitochondrial
  membrane potential of the breast cancer cells to trigger the mitochondrial signal
  pathway.
- Breast cancer is the most prevalent tumor and a major cause of morbidity and mortality
  among women [1].
- Each year, more than one million new cases appeared all over the world and brought
  serious harm to women health [2].
- Surgery together with chemotherapy is the main method for breast cancer treatment;
  the chemotherapy cannot only relieve or cure part of the tumor but it can also bring
  serious side effects to the patients, so finding a new therapeutic schedule with
  high efficiency and low toxicity has always been the target of the medical research.
- Caffeic acid 3,4-dihydroxy-phenethyl ester (CADPE), a compound originally isolated
  from medicinal plants _Sarcandra glabra_ and _Teucrium pilosum_ [3], has attracted
  more interests due to its proven pharmacologic safety and its many biologic activities,
  such as suppression of hepatocellular carcinoma growth [4] and gastric carcinoma
  cell migration [5].
- In the present study, we investigated the effects of CADPE on the breast cancer
  cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435 and explored the related mechanism.
- Culture medium RPMI-1640, trypsin-EDTA, penicillin/streptomycin, and fetal calf
  serum were bought from Gibco Company (Grand Island, NY, USA).
- MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435 cell lines were obtained from American Type of Culture
  Collection (ATCC; Manassas, VA, USA).

- The MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435 cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 culture medium supplemented
  with 10 % FBS and antibiotics under a fully humidified atmosphere and 37 °C and
  5 % CO2 condition.
- Cells in the log phase were treated with various concentrations of CADPE synthesized
  in our lab as described before [6].
- Cell proliferation was tested by Cell titer 96 ® AQueous nonradioactive cell proliferation
  assay.
- Briefly, log phase MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435 cells were treated with 0.25 % trypsin
  to make single-cell suspension with RPMI-1640; the cell concentration was adjusted
  to 5 × 107/L, and 100 μl of this single-cell suspension was planted into a 96-well
  plate and incubated at 37 °C with 5 % CO2 for 24 h. The medium was replaced with
  100 μl RPMI-1640 medium containing different concentrations of CADPE (0, 10, 20,
  40, and 80 μmol/l) and 10 % fetal calf serum, and cells were cultured at 37 °C and
  5 % CO2 condition for 0, 24, 48, and 72 h. Then, 20 μl Cell titer 96 ® AQueous nonradioactive
  cell proliferation assay reagent (Promega, USA) was added to each well for 4 h of
  additional incubation.
- The absorption values at 490 nm were determined with an automatic enzyme-linked
  immunosorbent assay plate reader (BMG POLARstar Omega, BMG Labtech, Germany).
- After treated with 0, 20, and 40 μmol/l CADPE for 48 h, MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435
  cells were collected and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).
- DNA of the washed cells (1 × 106) was subjected to incubation with 600 μl PI solution
  (Triton X-100, 0.1 %; PI, 20 μg/ml; RNase, 200 μg/ml) for 20 min, the cell cycles
  were determined with flow cytometry and analyzed utilizing CellQuest software (BD
  company, USA).
- After treatment with series concentrations of CADPE for 24 h, breast cancer cells
  MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435 were fixed with 4 % formaldehyde solution and washed with
  PBS for three times.
- After stained with 10 μmol/l of Hoechst 33342 for 10 min, the cells were washed
  twice with PBS again, and the changes of nucleic morphologies were observed under
  the fluorescence microscopy (MPS60, Leica Microsystems Welzlar GmbH, Bensheim, Germany).
- Apoptosis rates of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435 cells were measured after Annexin V-PE/7-AAD
  (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA, USA) double staining according to the instruction
  of the kit.
- Briefly, MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435 cells were cultured with RPMI-1640 culture medium
  containing 10 % fetal calf serum and different concentrations of CADPE in 6-well
  plates, collected and washed twice with PBS solution, and then rewashed with binding
  buffer (0.01 M HEPES/NaOH (pH 7.4), 0.14 M NaCl, and 2.5 mM CaCl2).
- Subsequently, cells were stained with Annexin V-PE/7-AAD at room temperature and
  dark condition for 15 min.
- The cells were washed with cold PBS for three times and detected with flow cytometry
  (BD Company, USA).
- The cells marked as Annexin V− and 7-AAD− were considered viable cells, Annexin
  V+ and 7-AAD− were counted as early apoptotic cells, Annexin V+ and 7-AAD+ cells
  were late apoptotic cells, and Annexin V− and 7-AAD+ were necrotic cells.
- The mitochondrial membrane potential was determined using the mitochondria-specific
  lipophilic cationic fluorescence dye 5,5′,6,6′-tetrachloro-1,1′,3,3′-tetraethylbenzimi-dazolylcarbocyanine
  iodide (JC-1) detection kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Abnova
  Corporation, Walnut, CA, USA).
- In brief, MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435 cells were treated with 10 or 20 μmol/l CADPE,
  co-cultured with 100 μl JC-1 for 30 min at 37 °C and dark condition, washed twice
  with PBS followed by measurement of the fluorescence intensity by fluorescent microscopy
  (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging GmbH, Goettingen, Germany).
- JC-1 can enter mitochondria selectively.
- In healthy cells with high mitochondrial membrane potential, the dye reagent aggregates
  and emits red fluorescence (normal membrane potential).
- When the mitochondrial membrane potential collapses, JC-1 cannot accumulate in the
  mitochondria, the cells will show only green fluorescence (decline membrane potential).
- The breast cancer MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435 cells at logarithmic phase were planted
  into 24-well flat-bottom plates, 6 × 104 cell/well, in RPMI-1640 culture medium
  containing 10 % fetal calf serum and CADPE (the final concentrations of CADPE are
  0, 10, 20, 40, and 80 μmol/l) under 37 °C and 5 % CO2 condition for 48 h. Then collected
  the cells and examined their ROS level with ROS fluorescence probes 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein
  diacetate (DCFH-DA; Invitrogen, USA).
- Briefly, discarded the supernatant of the cells, added 200 μl DCFH-DA (10 μmol/l)
  diluted with RPMI-1640 culture medium, and cultured the cells under 37 °C and 5
  % CO2 and no-light condition for 1 h. Washed the cells with RPMI-1640 culture medium
  for three times, discarded the supernatant, and analyzed the fluorescence intensity
  with fluorescence microplate (exCitation wavelength was 488 nm, emission wavelength
  was 525 nm).
- The examination was repeated three times.
- MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435 cells were treated with series concentrations of CADPE
  (0, 10, and 20 μmol/l), collected and washed twice with cold PBS.
- Then cells were incubated with RIPA buffer (50 mmol/l Tris–HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mmol/l
  NaCl, 1 % Triton X-100, 1 % sodium deoxycholate, 2 mmol/l EDTA (pH 8.0), and 0.1
  % SDS) at 4 °C for 30 min.
- After 13,000×_g_ centrifugation at 4 °C for 15 min, protein concentrations were
  determined by the bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA) using bovine serum albumin as standard.
- Forty micrograms of total cellular proteins and 10 μl of 2× sample buffer were mixed
  together and subjected to heat treatment at 100 °C for 5 min to denature the proteins.
- The proteins were separated with sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
  (SDS-PAGE; 12 % for caspase-3, Bcl-2, and Bax), transferred onto a polyvinylidene
  difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) using an electrotransfer
  system (0.8 mA/cm) (Ellard Inc., Seattle, WA, USA).
- The nitrocellulose membrane was blocked in the blocking buffer (5 % skim milk) at
  room temperature for 2 h, and incubated with the primary antibodies against Bcl,
  Bax, β-actin, and caspase-3 proteins at room temperature for 2 h (antibodies were
  diluted to 1:500 in Tris-buffered saline (TBS-T) containing Tween-20 (20 mmol/l
  Tris–HCl, pH 7.6, 136 mmol/l NaCl, and 0.1 % Tween-20).
- The membranes were washed three times with TBS-T liquid, before incubated with antimouse
  IgG-conjugated HRP (1:5,000 dilution in TBS-T buffer) at room temperature for at
  least 1 h. Protein bands were visualized by enhanced chemilluminescence kit (Amersham,
  Buckinghamshire, UK) and LAS-4000 imaging system (FUJIFILM, Tokyo, Japan).
- Formation of intracellular active oxygen was determined using a fluorescent probe
  2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCF-DA; Sigma Co.).
- DCF-DA, a nonfluorescent substance, changes into fluorescent green DCF in the presence
  of peroxides associated with intracellular hydrogen peroxides.
- CADPE was administered to MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435 cells and then cultured with
  5 μmol/l DCF-DA at 37 °C for 30 min.
- These cells were harvested after washed with PBS (pH 7.4) three times and 1 % trypsin-EDTA
  treatment.
- Then cells were washed twice with PBS again and fluorescence was measured with flow
  cytometry (FACSCalibur, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) and analyzed with the
  CellQuest software (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA).
- Results were generated more than three times independently.

- To evaluate the cytotoxicity of CADPE on the breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231
  and MDA-MB-435, CADPE was applied to the cells at a series of dosage levels for
  24, 48, and 72 h. Changes of the cell proliferation activity were measured with
  Cell titer 96®AQueous nonradioactive cell proliferation assay.

  To confirm that the grow inhibition induced by CADPE was mediated by cell apoptosis
  mechanisms, nucleic Hoechst33342 staining which allowed observing morphologic characteristics
  of cell apoptosis was carried out after MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435 cells were treated
  with 0, 10, and 20 μmol/l of CADPE for 24 h. Then the cells were observed with phase
  contrast fluorescence microscope.'

  with the control group.
- The nucleus of the 0 μmol/l CADPE-treated cells showed an oval shape with intact
  and homogenous fluorescence after Hoechst33342 staining, while fluorescent fragments
  that were segmented into several pieces were observed in the CADPE-treated groups.
- In addition, reductions in the number of cells as well as morphologic changes were
  concurrent (Fig.

  After breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435 were treated with series
  concentrations of CADPE for 24 h, the ROS level in the cells was upregulated.'
- ROS fluorescence intensities in the MDA-MB-231 cells and MDA-MB-435 cells were 38.38
  ± 0.19, 49.28 ± 0.2, 69.21 ± 0.38, and 80.00 ± 0.22 in 10, 20, 40, and 80 μmol/l

  To determine the mechanism of caspase-3, Bax, and Bcl-2 in modulating breast cancer
  cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435 apoptosis induced by CADPE, we analyzed the
  expression levels of caspase-3, Bax, and Bcl-2 proteins with Western blot after
  treatment with different concentrations of CADPE.'
- The results showed that 10, 20, 40 μmol/l CADPE treatment promoted the expression
  of caspase-3 and Bax and downregulated Bcl-2 expressions in a dose-dependent manner.
- β-actin was the internal control, suggesting that the protein loading amount was
  the same (Fig.
- 5).
- Collectively, these results suggest that CADPE induced apoptosis by activating expression
  of caspase-3, Bax, and inhibiting Bcl-2 in both the breast cancer cell lines (Fig.
- 5).
- Effects of CADPE on the protein expression levels of caspase-3, Bcl-2, and Bax in
  the MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435 cells using Western blot analysis.
- The cells were treated with various concentrations (0, 10, and 20 μmol/l) of CADPE.
- The equal amounts of protein from cell lysate were subjected on 12 % sodium dodecyl
  sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane
  and immunoblotted with anti-Bcl, anti-Bak, anti-caspase-3, and anti-β-actin antibodies.

  To determine whether the growth inhibitory effect of CADPE on the breast cancer
  cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435 is associated with cell apoptosis, Annexin
  V-PE/7-AAD double staining, and flow cytometric analyses were performed.'
- As shown in Fig.
- 6, the number of apoptotic cells increased in a dose-dependent manner after incubation
  with 0, 10, and 20 μmol/l CADPE.
- The upper left quadrant of the cytograms shows the dead cells, which is positive
  to 7-AAD and negative to Annexin V (Annexin V−, 7-AAD+).
- The lower left quadrant of the cytograms shows the viable cells (Annexin V−, 7-AAD−).
- In the upper right quadrant, it shows the late apoptotic and early necrotic cell
  (Annexin V+, 7-AAD +) population.
- The lower right quadrant shows apoptotic cells (Annexin V+, 7-AAD−).
- Compared with the control group, the apoptosis-inducing effects of CADPE on MDA-MB-231
  and MDA-MB-435 cells were 22.4 % (6C) and 11.8 % (6D) in 10 μmol/l CADPE-treated
  groups, 77.3 % (6E) and 66.7 % (6 F) in 20 μmol/l CADPE-treated groups, the apoptosis
  rates in all these groups were significantly higher than the 0-μmol/l CADPE-treated
  groups (6A, 4.0 % and 6B, 3.9 %) and had a tendency of dosage dependent.
- These results demonstrated that the inhibition of cell proliferation activity by
  CADPE was due to the apoptosis induction.

  (Annexin V+, 7-AAD+) population.
- 'The _lower right quadrant_ (Annexin V+, 7-AAD−) shows apoptotic cells




  Depletion of mitochondrial membrane potential is one of the early events that occur
  following induction of cellular apoptosis.'
- To determine the changes of mitochondrial membrane potential in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435
  cells after CADPE treatment, JC-1 staining was carried out.
- The fluorescence microscope observation confirmed that 10 and 20 μmol/l CADEP-treated
  cells showed progressive loss of red JC-aggregate fluorescence and appearance of
  green monomer fluorescence in the cytoplasm, and this decrease occurred in a dose-dependent
  manner (Fig.
- 7).
- These data suggested that the involvement of the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis
  in the mechanism of cell death induced by the CADPE.
- The results of cell mitochondrial membrane potential dissipation induced by CADPE.
- Breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435 were exposed to 0, 10, or 20
  μmol/l CADPE and stained by JC-1 reagent.
- Red fluorescence represents the mitochondrial aggregation form of JC-1 indicating
  intact mitochondrial membrane potential.
- 'Green fluorescence represents the monomeric form of JC-1 indicating a dissipation
  of mitochondrial membrane potential




  Breast cancer is the most common cancer, and accounting for nearly 25 % of all cancers
  in women.'
- In 2010, nearly 1.6 million women all over the world were diagnosed with breast
  cancer and almost occupy 14 % population of the cancer deaths in women [7].
- In recent years, the incidence of breast cancer kept increasing globally and showed
  poor prognosis even if the diagnosis and treatments of cancer had been improved
  greatly, and approximately 70–80 % of the breast cancer patients who were diagnosed
  in the early stage recurrence without any symptoms after surgery.
- Therefore, not only local treatments like surgery but also chemotherapy is very
  important for the breast cancer treatment.
- So, finding useful medicines and exploring their related mechanism is the key to
  achieve the real treatment for breast cancer.
- Apoptosis, the planned cell death, is characterized as cell shrinkage, nuclear collapse,
  membrane blebbing, and DNA fragmentation.
- Apoptosis plays critical roles in a lot of physiologic processes in cell development
  [8].
- Failure in apoptosis will facilitate tumor formation and development [9].
- The evidences proved gradually that many cancer chemotherapeutic medicines killed
  the cancer cells through inducing cell apoptosis.
- One of the important apoptotic pathways is mitochondrial-mediated signal pathway
  [1].
- In this pathway, mitochondria play the key role in mediating cell apoptosis and
  upregulating of the membrane potential is the main mechanism for inducing cell apoptosis
  [2].
- Mitochondrial damage is associated with the high level of caspases and ROS production.
- Decline of mitochondrial membrane potential leads to the caspase-3 activation which
  is an important effector in apoptosis inducing [10].
- Caspase-3 can lead to dismantling of the cell such as disruption of organelle function,
  cytoskeletal and nuclear disassembly through regulating a series of substrates,
  result in the typical hallmark features of apoptosis [6, 7].
- Many pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins, which belong to the Bcl-2 family, were found
  to be upregulated (Bax) and downregulated (Bcl-2) in a lot of cell apoptosis [11–13].
- Many data also confirmed that some chemical therapy medicines could result in the
  DNA damage through upregulating the apoptosis-promoting proteins of Bcl-2 family.
- To explore the apoptosis-inducing function of CADPE on breast cancer cell lines
  MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435 and clarify if this apoptosis-inducing function of CADPE
  is through mitochondrial signal pathway, a series of studies were performed.
- Cell proliferation analysis results revealed that CADPE induced a decrease of cell
  proliferation activity of these breast cancer cells in a time- and dose-dependent
  manner.
- Flow cytometry examination data confirmed the decline of the proliferation capability
  induced by CADPE was not related with cell cycle arrest of these cells.
- Western blot analysis showed that the expression levels of caspase-3, Bcl-2, and
  Bax were influenced by CADPE treatment, CADPE upregulated the expression of caspase-3
  obviously, at the same time, it broke the balance of Bax and Bcl-2, leading to the
  Bax in a dominant position, and the ratio of Bcl-2 and Bax declined remarkably.
- The results of ROS examination also confirmed that CADPE can enhance the ROS level
  of these cells.
- The cell cycle analysis, Hoechst staining, flow cytometry analysis and JC-1 staining
  of the breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435, which were treated with
  CADPE, also indicated that CADPE can downregulate the Mitochondrial Membrane Potential
  and induce cell apoptosis of these cells, and the apoptosis characterized as nucleic
  acid fragmentation, chromatin condensation and morphological changes with the number
  of cells reductions.
- In conclusion, CADPE represented a superior dose- and time-dependent cytotoxicity
  in high metastatic breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435.
- It can inhibit the growth of these cells in dose and time-dependent manner through
  inducing nucleus fragmentation, upregulating the ROS level and the expression of
  apoptosis precursor protein Bax, downregulating anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 expression,
  increasing the ratio of Bax and Bcl-2, decreasing mitochondrial membrane potential,
  triggering the caspase-3 cascade and inducing cell apoptosis of these breast cancer
  cells.
- Thus, results in the study suggest that CADPE could be utilized as a cancer treatment
  against breast cancer.
- This experiment provided a certain reference value for application of CADPE in the
  treatment of high metastatic breast cancer.
- This study was partly supported by Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau Foundation(2008021).
