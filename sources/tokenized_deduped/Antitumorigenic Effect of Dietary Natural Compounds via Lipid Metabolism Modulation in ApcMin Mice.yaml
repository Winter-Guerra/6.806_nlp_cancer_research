- 'Aim: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of a diet supplementation
  with either olive oil, or n-3 or n-6-polyunsaturatedFatty acids (PUFAs) on tumour
  development and gene expression for lipogenic enzymes in ApcMin/+ mice.'
- 'Materials and Methods: In the control group, the mice received a standard diet,
  the OO group was fed on a diet with 12% olive oil, the OM-3 group with 12% salmon
  fish rich in n-3 PUFAs, the OM-6 group with 12% oenothera oil rich in n-6 PUFAs.'
- Gene expression of lipogenic enzymes was evaluated by real-time reverse transcription
  polymerase chain reaction.
- 'Results: All mice in the treated groups presented a reduction in total intestinal
  polyp number and load, which was particularly marked in the OM-3 group.'
- Treated mice showed an induction of low density lipoprotein receptor gene expression
  and a significant reduction of expression of lipogenic gene.
- 'Conclusion: Our data provide new insights into the mechanism of cell growth inhibition
  and apoptotic regulation by dietary olive oil and PUFAs in ApcMin/+ mice.'
