- Epidemiological studies show that fruit- and vegetable-rich diets are associated
  with a reduced risk of developing certain forms of cancer, including breast cancer.
- In this study we demonstrate that a subcytotoxic concentration of apigenin, which
  is a flavone found at high concentrations in parsley, onions, grapefruit, oranges,
  and chamomile tea, inhibited DNA synthesis in a panel of human breast cancer cell
  lines (MDA-MB-231, MBA-MB-468, MCF-7, SK-BR-3).
- Decreased proliferation of MDA-MB-468 cells in the presence of apigenin was associated
  with G2/M phase cell cycle arrest and the production of reactive oxygen species.
- Apigenin-treated MDA-MB-468 cells also showed reduced phosphorylation of Akt (protein
  kinase B), which is an essential effector serine/threonine kinase in the phosphatidylinositide
  3-kinase pathway that promotes tumor growth and progression.
- However, exposure to the antioxidant reduced glutathione failed to reverse apigenin-mediated
  inhibition of Akt phosphorylation and cell proliferation, indicating that these
  effects were not due to oxidative stress.
- Taken together, these findings suggest that low-dose apigenin has the potential
  to slow or prevent breast cancer progression.
