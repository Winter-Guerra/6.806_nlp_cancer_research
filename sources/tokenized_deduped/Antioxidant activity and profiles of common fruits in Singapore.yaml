- Thirty-eight types of fruits commonly consumed in Singapore were systematically
  analysed for their hydrophilic oxygen radical absorbance capacity (H-ORAC), total
  phenolic content (TPC), ascorbic acid (AA) and various lipophilic antioxidants.
- Antioxidant composition and concentration varied widely across different fruits.
- Many of the tropical fruits tested were high in antioxidants.
- Amongst all fruits tested, sapodilla (_Manilkara zapota_) had the highest H-ORAC
  and TPC whilst guava had the highest AA per gram fresh weight.
- Papaya, red watermelon and cantaloupe had the highest Î²-cryptoxanthin, lycopene
  and Î²-carotene per gram fresh weight, respectively.
- On the other hand, durian and mangosteen were high in tocopherols and tocotrienols,
  respectively.
- Based on consumption data, Chinese Singaporeans appear to have a higher intake of
  carotenoids and tocopherols rich fruits compared to the US population.
- As fruits are a rich source of diverse antioxidants, efforts to promote consumption
  of a variety of fruits should be continued for public health benefits.
