- Anthracycline chemotherapy is often used in the treatment of various malignancies.
- Its application, however, encounters several limitations due to development of serious
  side effects, mainly cardiotoxicity and may be ineffective due to multidrug resistance
  (MDR).
- Many different compounds have been evaluated as poorly effective in the protection
  against anthracycline side effects and in the prevention from MDR.
- Thus, continuous investigational efforts are necessary to find valuable protectants
  and the flavonoid quercetin (Q) seems to be a promising candidate.
- It is present in relatively high amounts in a human diet and the lack of its toxicity,
  including genotoxicity has been confirmed.
- The structure of Q favours its high antioxidant activity, the potential to inhibit
  the activity of oxidative enzymes and to interact with membrane transporter proteins
  responsible for development of MDR, e.g.
- P-glycoprotein.
- Furthermore, Q can influence cellular signalling and gene expression, and thus,
  alter response to exogenous genotoxicants and oxidative stress in normal cells.
- It accounts for its chemopreventive and anticancer properties.
- Overall, these properties might indicate the possibility of application of Q as
  cardioprotectant during anthracycline chemotherapy.
- Moreover, numerous biological properties displayed by Q might possibly result in
  the reversal of MDR in tumour cells and improve the efficacy of chemotherapy.
- However, these beneficial effects towards anthracycline-induced complications of
  chemotherapy have to be further explored and confirmed both in animal and clinical
  studies.
- Concurrently, investigations aimed at improvement of the bioavailability of Q and
  further elucidation of its metabolism after application in combination with anthracyclines
  are needed.
