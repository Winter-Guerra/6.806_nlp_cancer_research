- While most invasive breast cancers consist of carcinomas of the ductal type, about
  10% are invasive lobular carcinomas.
- Invasive lobular and ductal carcinomas differ with respect to risk factors.
- Invasive lobular carcinoma is more strongly associated with exposure to female hormones,
  and therefore its incidence is more subject to variation.
- 'This is illustrated by US figures during the 1987 to 2004 period: after 12 years
  of increases, breast cancer incidence declined steadily from 1999 to 2004, reflecting
  among other causes the decreasing use of menopausal hormone therapy, and these variations
  were stronger for invasive lobular than for invasive ductal carcinoma.'
- Similarly, invasive lobular carcinoma is more strongly associated with early menarche,
  late menopause and late age at first birth.
- As for genetic risk factors, four high-penetrance genes are tested in clinical practice
  when genetic susceptibility to breast cancer is suspected, _BRCA1_, _BRCA2_, _TP53_
  and _CDH1._ Germline mutations in _BRCA1_ and _TP53_ are predominantly associated
  with invasive ductal carcinoma, while _BRCA2_ mutations are associated with both
  ductal and lobular cancers.
- _CDH1_, the gene coding for the E-cadherin adhesion protein, is of special interest
  as mutations are associated with invasive lobular carcinoma, but never with ductal
  carcinoma.
- It was initially known as the main susceptibility gene for gastric cancer of the
  diffuse type, but the excess of breast cancers of the lobular type in _CDH1_ families
  led researchers to identify it also as a susceptibility gene for invasive lobular
  carcinoma.
- The risk of invasive lobular carcinoma is high in female mutation carriers, as about
  50% are expected to develop the disease.
- Carriers must therefore undergo intensive breast cancer screening, with, for example,
  yearly magnetic resonance imaging and mammogram starting at age 30 years.
- Invasive breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease of two main histological types,
  invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) and invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC), IDC being
  by far the most common.
- IDC and ILC differ with respect to risk factors, and these differences are often
  overlooked as researchers and clinicians tend to treat breast cancer as a single,
  homogeneous entity, or only explore the potential differences between the two types
  in _post hoc_ analyses.
- In this review, we focus on the specificities of ILC regarding incidence and risk
  factors.
- We show that ILC is more strongly associated with exposure to female hormones than
  IDC and that, as a result, its incidence in the past 25 to 30 years has varied more
  than that of IDC, depending on environmental and lifestyle factors such as menopausal
  hormone therapy (MHT).
- As for genetic risk factors, we show that ILC is often underrepresented in patients
  carrying mutations in the best-known breast cancer susceptibility genes (_BRCA1_,
  _TP53_), but that it is the only invasive histological type associated with _CDH1_,
  the diffuse gastric cancer susceptibility gene.
- ILCs represent about 10% of invasive breast cancer cases [1],[2].
- Patients diagnosed with ILC are, on average, about 3 years older than those with
  IDC [3].
- Compared with patients with IDC, ILCs are generally diagnosed at a more advanced
  stage, with larger tumor sizes and more frequent lymph node invasion, and are more
  often estrogen receptor- and progesterone receptor-positive [3].
- Studies conducted in the US indicated a 65% increase in the incidence of ILC between
  1987 and 1999, while IDC rates increased by only 3% during the same period [1].
- However, after 1999, the age-adjusted incidence rates of both ILC and IDC steadily
  declined [2],[4].
- More specifically, an average annual decrease of 4.6% for ILC was noted between
  1999 and 2004 in 44 American states and the District of Columbia, with the largest
  drop in 2003 when an 8.5% decrease was observed.
- The average annual decrease for IDC was smaller, 3.3% for the same five-year period.
- It is likely that the decreasing use of MHT contributed to this decline, with an
  acceleration in use reduction from 2002 onwards associated with the publication
  of the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) trial results [4],[5].
- Most breast cancers are related to female hormones, and therefore any factor that
  increases exposure to these hormones is a potential risk factor.
- In particular, reproductive factors associated with increased exposure to endogenous
  estrogens produced by the ovaries, such as earlier menarche, late menopause, low
  parity, and late age at first birth, are recognized breast cancer risk factors [6]-[8].
- Similarly, women exposed to exogenous hormones (for example, through MHT or oral
  contraceptives) are often at increased risk [5],[9]-[12].
- Lifestyle factors are also associated with breast cancer.
- There is an estimated 10% increase in risk per 10 g of ethanol consumed every day
  [13].
- Being overweight or obese is also associated with breast cancer risk, but only in
  postmenopausal women, with a gain of 5 kg/m2 in body mass index (BMI) resulting
  in an 8% increase in disease risk [13].
- On the contrary, excess weight is associated with a decrease in risk in premenopausal
  women.
- 'Again, these associations can be explained by hormonal factors: alcohol consumption
  and postmenopausal obesity are related to higher circulating estrogen levels [14].'
- In postmenopause, elevated estrogen levels are most probably due to extraglandular
  production in the adipose tissue, whereas in premenopause, the decrease in female
  hormone synthesis associated with anovulatory cycles in obese women likely explains
  the inverse association with breast cancer [14].
- ILC being more often hormone receptor-positive than IDC, one would expect hormone-related
  risk factors to be more strongly associated with lobular than ductal carcinoma.
- MHT in the form of combined estrogen plus progestin treatment (combined hormone
  therapy or CHT) most likely increases the risk of breast cancer, whereas the effects
  of estrogen-only treatments (estrogen hormone therapy or EHT) are less clear [12],[15]-[17].
- In 2002 the WHI trial demonstrated that CHT use increased breast cancer risk [5].
- In this prospective, randomized primary prevention trial, there was a 26% increase
  in risk of invasive breast cancer in patients taking CHT.
- A subsequent, detailed analysis of tumor characteristics concluded that the percentages
  and distribution of IDC and ILC were similar in the CHT and the placebo group [18].
- In the WHI estrogen-alone trial that included women with a prior hysterectomy, use
  of conjugated equine estrogens was associated with a 20 to 25% decreased risk of
  invasive breast cancer compared with the placebo group, a reduction in risk that
  was observed with IDC (−30%) in subgroup analyses, but not with ILC, perhaps because
  of insufficient statistical power [17],[19].
- This reduction in risk is consistent with preclinical, cellular and animal models
  showing that low-dose estradiol can cause tumor regression and apoptosis after prior
  estrogen deprivation [19]-[21].
- Twenty-five observational studies (15 case control and 10 cohort studies) have evaluated
  the association between MHT and breast cancer risk by histological types [22]-[46].
- Although the heterogeneity between histological subgroups was not always formally
  tested or did not reach statistical significance, a vast majority of these studies
  showed that MHT was more strongly associated with ILC than IDC.
- As for the type of MHT, studies that reported associations separately for CHT and
  EHT are presented in Figure 1.
- For current CHT use, the relative risk (RR) was generally lower than 2.0 for IDC
  (overall RR 1.5, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.5 to 1.6) while it exceeded 2.0
  for ILC in a majority of studies (overall RR 2.0, 95% CI 1.9 to 2.1).
- RR associated with current EHT use varied between 0.7 and 2.0 for IDC (overall RR
  1.1, 95% CI 1.0 to 1.1) and between 1.0 and 2.1 for ILC (overall RR 1.4, 95% CI
  1.3 to 1.5).
- Intriguingly, studies that restricted their analyses to estrogen receptor and progesterone
  receptor tumors still showed a stronger association for ILC than for IDC, suggesting
  that mechanisms independent of the hormone receptors account for the increased sensitivity
  of ILC to MHT [36],[38],[40]-[42],[45],[46].
- Figure 1.
- Relative risks of invasive ductal and lobular breast cancer associated with menopausal
  hormone therapy in 22 observational studies.
- CHT, combined hormone therapy; CI, confidence interval; EHT, estrogen hormone therapy;
  RR, relative risk.
- Oral contraceptives are expected to become less of a risk factor as recent formulations
  contain less hormones than those available decades ago [12].
- To our knowledge, there are no data indicating that oral contraceptives in general
  have a differential effect on breast cancer depending on the histological subtype.
- A recent meta-analysis of individual participant data from 85 studies showed a significantly
  stronger association with age at menarche for ILC than for IDC (RR per year younger
  at menarche 1.073 and 1.035, respectively, _P_ heterogeneity = 0.0001) [7].
- There was also significant heterogeneity between ILC and IDC with respect to the
  association with age at menopause, with a 3.6% increase in risk of ILC per year
  older at menopause, versus 2.6% for IDC (_P_ heterogeneity = 0.006).
- Late age at first birth is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer [8].
- Among the 19 studies that explored the association between breast cancer type and
  age at first birth [32],[33],[35],[42]-[45],[47]-[58], 14 observed higher risk estimates
  for ILC than for IDC [33],[35],[42]-[45],[47],[49],[51],[54]-[58].
- Associations with other reproductive factors, such as parity and breastfeeding,
  were in general not markedly different between ILC and IDC, although a few studies
  reported stronger associations with parity for IDC than for ILC [42],[43],[47],[49],[51].
- Among eight studies (four case control and four cohort studies) that examined the
  association between alcohol consumption and breast cancer by histological subtype
  [33],[35],[42],[45],[59]-[62], two observed a significant heterogeneity between
  ILC and IDC [33],[62].
- RRs were higher for ILC than for IDC [33],[35],[42],[45],[59],[60],[62].
- Four cohort studies [42],[43],[45],[63] and five case–control studies [32],[33],[35],[44],[50]
  examined the associations between anthropometric measures (mostly BMI and height)
  and risk of breast cancer by histogical type.
- Overall, none observed significant heterogeneity between IDC and ILC regarding the
  association with BMI or height.
- The two studies that examined the association with physical activity did not observe
  significant heterogeneity between IDC and ILC [45],[64].
- Along with environment and lifestyle, a woman’s genetic background contributes to
  her risk of having breast cancer.
- Her risk of developing breast cancer increases if she has a family history of the
  disease.
- 'In a re-analysis of 52 studies comparing cancer incidence in relatives of breast
  cancer cases and in controls, RR for breast cancer increased with increasing numbers
  of affected first-degree relatives: compared with women who had no affected relative,
  the RR was 1.80, 2.93, and 3.90, respectively, for women with one, two, and three
  or more affected first-degree relatives [65].'
- RR was greatest at young ages and, for women of a given age, was greater the younger
  the relative was when diagnosed.
- Twin studies provide evidence that genes contribute substantially to this excess
  familial risk of breast cancer.
- Combined data on all twin pairs listed in three North-European registries showed
  that concordance for breast cancer was two times higher among monozygotic twins,
  who share all their genes, than among dizygotic twins, who share half their genes
  [66].
- About 90 genes or genetic loci are involved in breast cancer susceptibility in general,
  through rare, moderate to high penetrance mutations (lifetime risk &gt;20%), the
  penetrance being the risk for a mutation carrier of developing a disease, or through
  common variants associated with risks that are only slightly increased compared
  with the wild-type allele (RR = 1 to 1.5).
- Mutations and variants are germline; that is, they are part of the genetic identity
  of the individual.
- A comprehensive review of genetic susceptibility to breast cancer is beyond the
  scope of this article, as we are focusing here on the specificities of ILC.
- Numerous reviews have been written on the issue, and we invite those interested
  to read two recent and extremely well-written articles [67],[68].
- 'Four high-penetrance genes are tested in clinical practice when genetic susceptibility
  to breast cancer is suspected: _BRCA1_, _BRCA2_, _TP53_ and _CDH1_.'
- Germline mutations in _BRCA1_ and _TP53_ are predominantly associated with IDC,
  _BRCA2_ mutations are associated with both ductal and lobular tumors, while mutations
  in _CDH1_ are exclusively associated with ILC.
- Mutations in _PTEN_ and _STK11_ cause, respectively, Cowden and Peutz-Jaeger syndrome,
  and breast cancer risk is also high in affected females.
- However, the presenting manifestations are usually not related to breast cancer
  (for example, macrocephaly, central nervous system abnormalities, mucocutaneous
  lesions, gastrointestinal hamartomas) and we shall therefore not discuss these two
  syndromes further [69],[70].
- In the 1990s, linkage analyses and positional cloning in breast and breast-ovarian
  cancer families led to the identification of _BRCA1_ and _BRCA2_[71],[72].
- Both have a role in maintaining DNA integrity.
- Mutations confer a high risk of breast and ovarian cancer with estimated breast
  cancer penetrances of 60% for _BRCA1_ and 55% for _BRCA2_ by age 70 years [73].
- However, not all breast and breast-ovarian cancer families carry a mutation in _BRCA1_
  or _BRCA2_[74].
- For example, 41% of families with four or five cases of breast cancer under the
  age of 60 years - but no ovarian cancer - are carriers, but that proportion increases
  to 88% in families with at least four breast cancer cases and one case of ovarian
  cancer.
- Mutations are rare in population-based, unselected breast cancer cases.
- The detection rate was, for example, 2% in a large English series of women diagnosed
  below age 55 years, although it increased to 12% in the subset of women diagnosed
  before age 35 years [75].
- These are likely underestimates, as the sensitivity of gene analysis techniques
  was lower in the late 1990s than it is today.
- Some phenotypic characteristics influence the probability of carrying a mutation
  in _BRCA1_ or _BRCA2_.
- For example, up to 15% of unselected women with triple-negative breast cancer have
  a _BRCA1_ mutation, while there does not seem to be an association with _BRCA2_[76].
- Similarly, the distribution among different breast cancer types varies according
  to the predisposing gene involved.
- The CIMBA Consortium analyzed the pathology of invasive breast cancers in 6,893
  _BRCA1_/_2_ mutation carriers, and found that only 2.2% of tumors associated with
  _BRCA1_ were ILC.
- In contrast, the proportion of ILCs in _BRCA2_ mutation carriers was 8.4%, closer
  to the characteristics of breast cancers from the general population [1],[77].
- Li-Fraumeni syndrome is characterized by early onset of a variety of tumors.
- It is caused by mutations in the tumour-suppressor gene _TP53_.
- Affected individuals are at increased risk of sarcoma, premenopausal breast cancer,
  brain cancer, adrenocortical cancer, leukaemia, lymphoma, germ cell tumor, melanoma,
  lung cancer and cancer of the digestive tract [78].
- Cancer risk by age 45 years is about 41% in males and 84% in females; lifetime risk
  is 73% in males, and approaches 100% in females [79].
- The majority of cancers in females are breast cancers, and most breast cancers are
  diagnosed before age 45 years.
- Little is known regarding the histological characteristics of breast cancers associated
  with germline _TP53_ mutations, but the two studies that have examined the issue
  have only shown tumors of the ductal type - and none of the lobular type - out of
  a total of 48 cancers in mutation carriers [80],[81].
- These data suggest that _TP53_ might predispose exclusively to IDC, and not to ILC.
- Confirmatory studies are nevertheless needed, and it seems premature at this stage
  to exclude ILC from the tumor spectrum associated with Li-Fraumeni syndrome.
- ILCs are therefore very much underrepresented in carriers of _BRCA1_ and _TP53_
  mutations, while their frequency in _BRCA2_ mutation carriers is more similar to
  that in the general population.
- This overall underrepresentation of lobular cancers contrasts with observations
  made in over 40,000 Utah cases with genealogical records showing unusually high
  levels of familial clustering for ILC, and therefore a higher contribution of genetic,
  inherited factors compared with IDC [82].
- The _CDH1_ susceptibility gene likely explains at least some of this excess in familial
  risk, the remainder being accounted for by genes and loci that are yet to be discovered.
- _CDH1_ is located on chromosome 16q22 and codes for the E-cadherin protein.
- E-cadherin maintains tissue integrity as it mediates cell-cell adhesion.
- There is also evidence that forced expression of the protein inhibits the growth
  of breast cancer cells via mechanisms that are yet to be determined, and that the
  protein therefore controls cell proliferation in addition to its anti-invasion properties
  [83],[84].
- Its tumor-suppression role is limited to breast cancer of the lobular type.
- Indeed, loss of expression is observed in the majority of lobular breast carcinomas,
  and, in the few tumors with conserved expression, E-cadherin integrity is impaired
  [85].
- On the contrary, expression is unaffected in ductal breast carcinomas [86].
- First-event somatic mutations, with subsequent loss of heterozygosity or promoter
  methylation, are classically responsible for _CDH1_ inactivation following the two-hit
  loss-of-function model [84].
- Therefore, an individual with an inherited, germline mutation in _CDH1_ is at increased
  risk of ILC as a single somatic event is sufficient to generate tumorigenesis.
- Readers should be reminded here that _CDH1_ was initially known as a susceptibility
  gene for gastric cancer of the diffuse type, following the identification of germline
  mutations in Caucasian, Maori and African-American families with multiple affected
  individuals [87]-[91].
- Like in ILC, E-cadherin inactivation is an early event in diffuse gastric cancer
  development and, as expected in this context, the histopathological characteristics
  of diffuse gastric cancer show similarities with ILC, with neoplastic cells permeating
  the mucosa and wall as scattered individual signet-ring cells or small clusters
  in an infiltrative growth pattern [87],[92],[93].
- In a collaborative study based on 11 _CDH1_ families, the International Gastric
  Cancer Linkage Consortium showed that the clinical penetrance for diffuse gastric
  cancer was high, as the estimated risk for carriers of developing the disease was
  67 to 83% [94].
- Interestingly, that same study observed that, in addition to diffuse gastric cancer,
  female carriers were also at high risk of ILC [94].
- Indeed, there were seven cases of breast cancers in these 11 _CDH1_ families, some
  of them at an early age, and histology, when documented, was systematically of the
  lobular type.
- The estimated risk for ILC was 39% by age 80 years.
- 'Subsequent studies of families with _CDH1_ mutations led to similar conclusions:
  in four families with a total of 22 breast cancers, all invasive tumors for which
  a pathological report was available were lobular [95],[96].'
- As for penetrance, a recent estimate derived from 67 mutation-positive families
  is 56% (P Kaurah and D Huntsman, personal communication).
- There is increasing evidence that a personal history of early-onset bilateral ILC
  or family history of multiple ILC at a young age, in the absence of diffuse gastric
  cancer in the family, can be associated with _CDH1_ germline mutations.
- Masciari and colleagues [97] described the case of a woman carrier with unilateral
  ILC at age 42 years, and whose mother had been diagnosed with the same condition
  at age 28 years.
- We reported three female cases who presented with bilateral ILC below age 50 years
  and turned out to carry mutations in _CDH1_[98].
- In the only systematic study of women with bilateral lobular breast neoplasia before
  age 60 years (ILC and/or lobular carcinoma _in situ_), Petridis and colleagues [99]
  found mutations in 4 out of 50 (8%) women.
- Schrader and colleagues [100] had previously looked into the issue with discrepant
  findings, as they only found mutations or potentially causal variants in 4 out of
  318 (1%) women with ILC either before age 45 years or regardless of age if there
  was a family history of breast cancer.
- However, it was not known how many women actually had a family history of breast
  cancer of the lobular type, as histology in relatives was not specified.
- Furthermore, there was no upper age limit for women with familial ILC, and _BRCA1_/_2_
  mutations had not been excluded in all cases.
- Cancer geneticists should therefore consider prescribing _CDH1_ germline analysis
  in patients with a personal or family history of multiple pathologically proven
  early-onset ILC, but no diffuse gastric cancer, as the identification of a mutation
  would have direct and dramatic clinical implications.
- The patient would be offered risk-reducing gastrectomy (assuming her ILC has been
  successfully treated), given the high risk of diffuse gastric cancer [94],[101].
- Her adult relatives would then undergo targeted genetic analysis to see if they
  carry the mutation, and those who do would also be offered risk-reducing gastrectomy.
- Surveillance with upper endoscopy is a poor alternative to prophylactic surgery,
  except in very specific situations (for example, young athletes wishing to delay
  surgery for professional reasons, and elderly or frail patients), as this screening
  modality frequently misses foci of diffuse carcinoma in mutation carriers even when
  accompanied by multiple random biopsies [102],[103].
- Large, multicenter studies on the prevalence of _CDH1_ mutations in patients and
  families with multiple cases of ILC are needed.
- The high risk of ILC in females carrying a _CDH1_ mutation justifies personalized,
  intensive surveillance.
- The consensus 2010 _CDH1_ paper recommended that breast cancer surveillance be carried
  out within specific research protocols, and suggested annual magnetic resonance
  imaging (MRI) and mammogram starting at age 35 years [101].
- As ILC risk is close to the overall breast cancer risk seen in carriers of _BRCA1_/_BRCA2_
  mutations, it seems reasonable to offer the same type of surveillance as a routine
  procedure, and start screening at age 30 years with annual MRI and mammogram [104],[105].
- Risk-reducing mastectomy could be an alternative.
- Updated international recommendations on the management of _CDH1_ mutation carriers
  that will address the issue are expected soon.
- Over 80 other breast cancer susceptibility genes and loci have been identified in
  the past few years, but again none have entered clinical practice either because
  of the difficulty in interpreting results from sequencing analyses or because the
  RR associated with the mutated alleles is so low that there is at best limited clinical
  relevance [67],[106].
- Only one low-penetrance variant was specifically associated with ILC in a pooled,
  _post hoc_ analysis of 36 case–control studies [106].
- We have reviewed in this article the specificities of ILC regarding disease incidence
  and environmental, lifestyle and genetic risk factors, and have shown that there
  were notable differences with IDC.
- ILC is more strongly related to endogenous and exogenous female hormones and its
  incidence, therefore, is more subject to variation, depending, for example, on key
  reproductive factors such as age at menarche or at first pregnancy, or on MHT use.
- Genetic risk factors vary depending on breast cancer histology, and _CDH1_ proves
  that genes involved in susceptibility to ILC do not have to be involved in IDC susceptibility.
- The type-specific hypothesis is hardly ever explored in breast cancer epidemiology.
- It is essential, therefore, that, in the near future, studies start turning their
  attention specifically to ILC instead of relying on _post hoc_ exploratory analyses,
  or on data extracted from families with mutations predisposing primarily to other
  cancers.
- More epidemiological studies are still needed to establish whether associations
  with other known (physical activity, measures of anthropometry) or still unidentified
  risk factors differ depending on the histological type.
- As for genetic studies, large-scale projects focusing on women with unexplained
  early-onset or familial ILC are urgently needed, as there are certainly many more
  clinically relevant susceptibility genes to discover.
- The identification of specific risk factors would help define high-risk groups that
  could benefit from adapted, personalized screening strategies.
