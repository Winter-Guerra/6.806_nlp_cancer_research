  · 5-fluorouracil Introduction The burden of cancer is increasing worldwide.
- About 14.1 million new cancer cases and 8.2 million cancer deaths are estimated
  to have occurred based on GLOBOCAN 2012, the standard data set produced to estimate
  cancer incidence and mortality worldwide by the International Agency for Research
  on Cancer (IARC) for 2012 (Ferlay et al., 2013).
- In spite of continuous cancer prevention efforts, cancer incidence increases globally
  with the growth of the elderly population.
- IARC also projected that deaths from cancer will substantially increase to over
  19.3 million in 2025 (Ferlay et al., 2013).
- Therefore, it is important to design better strategies for cancer treatment to increase
  the quality of life of growing cancer patients.
- Although local and regional tumors can be effectively treated by surgery and radiation
  therapy, chemotherapy is currently used for most cancer patients, because effective
  treatment requires reaching every organ in the body (Chabner and Roberts, 2005;
  DeVita and Chu, 2008).
- Traditional chemotherapy is a drug treatment that uses chemicals to kill fast-growing
  cells such as cancer cells.
- The first widely used cancer drugs, nitrogen mustards and antifolate drugs, were
  discovered in the 1940s (Chabner and Roberts, 2005).
- It was decade later that the molecular actions of those drugs were identified as
  induction of DNA damage, leading development of many anticancer compounds that use
  the same principle to treat cancer cells (Chabner and Roberts, 2005; DeVita and
  Chu, 2008).
- Those compounds include cisplatin, doxorubicin, and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), which
  are still used as the mainstay treatment of many types of cancer (Chabner and Roberts,
  2005; DeVita and Chu, 2008).
- The development of chemotherapeutic agents made a significant progress in systemic
  treatments - relieving cancer burden and improving quality of life of cancer patients
  (Widakowich et al., 2007; DeVita and Chu, 2008).
- However, these traditional chemotherapeutic drugs often confront the limitation
  in their use.
- A major problem is intrinsic and/or acquired resistance of cancer cells to the drug
  (Sreekanth et al., 2011).
- Another obstacle rises from their adverse effect to normal cells - particularly
  rapidly growing cells (i.e., the cells that line the digestive tract and bone marrow
  cells) (Chabner and Roberts, 2005).
- 'These limitations led to new designs for chemotherapy such as modification of Y.

  (2014) 57(2), 273−280 compounds to be more specific to cancer cells and/or development
  of new type of therapeutic drugs that target the processes of caner development
  specifically at the molecular level, namely molecular targeted therapy (Chabner
  and Roberts, 2005).'
- Therefore, molecular targeted therapies are expected to be more selective than traditional
  chemotherapy and do less harm to normal cells.
- Progress in knowledge of cancer biology gave rise to development of many monoclonal
  antibodies and small molecules that interfere with a specific molecular target involved
  in tumor growth and progression (Arora and Scholar, 2005).
- Transition from traditional chemotherapy to targeted therapy is obviously an important
  advance in cancer treatment.
- However, targeted therapy still faces the same limitation that traditional chemotherapy
  has - resistance to drug and drug- induced toxicity (Widakowich et al., 2007).
- Although these novel targeted therapies are highly selective, molecules that they
  target are also expressed in normal cells and potentially disrupt normal cellular
  function (Widakowich et al., 2007).
- Moreover, cancer is highly heterogeneous disease that displays diverse phenotypes
  and functions among cancer cells within the same tumor (Yardley, 2013).
- This heterogeneity of cancer makes it difficult to be treated with the single targeted
  therapy.
- Therefore, more effective treatment can be achieved by combining existing cancer
  therapeutic drugs (either traditional or targeted therapy) together or using them
  with novel compounds (Yardley, 2013).
- Understanding of molecular action of each compound is critical to designing combination
  therapy that act through synergistic or complementary mechanisms to overcome resistance
  to therapy and reduce toxicity derived from chemotherapy (DeVita and Chu, 2008).
- Many food bioactive compounds have exhibited anticancer activity (Hatcher et al.,
  2008).
- Hence, they can be good candidates for combination therapy with either traditional
  or targeted chemotherapy to enhance efficacy of cancer treatment and reduce drug
  toxicity by lowering the dose of drug.
- However, a major obstacle to using food-derived bioactive compounds in combination
  therapy might be that their anticancer mechanisms are not well-defined.
- Curcumin is a polyphenolic compound that gives the strong yellow color to the spice
  turmeric, powdered rhizome of Curcuma longa.
- It is one of the compounds that have been extensively studied for its anticancer
  activity in many types of cancer (Kwon et al., 2004; Hatcher et al., 2008).
- In addition, it has been extensively used for flavor and color in food preparation
  as well as treatment of inflammatory conditions and other diseases in East Asia
  (Ammon and Wahl, 1991).
- During its long history of usage in diet, almost no toxicity of curcumin yet has
  been reported (Ammon and Wahl, 1991), making it a good candidate for combination
  therapy.
- Many studies also demonstrated effectiveness of combinational use of curcumin to
  improve efficacy of TRAIL- mediated immunotherapy (Shankar et al., 2007; Wahl et
  al., 2007; Park et al., 2013; Reuss et al., 2013) and radiation therapy (Qiao et
  al., 2013).
- This article will focus on curcumin use in combination with traditional chemotherapeutic
  drugs.
- In this article, the molecular mechanisms that are involved in resistance to the
  drug will be introduced, and studies that have evaluated curcumin effect on the
  drug efficacy will be summarized, leading to discussion on potential usefulness
  of combinational treatment of curcumin and traditional chemotherapeutic drugs.
- Cisplatin Cisplatin or cis-diamminedichloridoplatinum(II) is the first platinum-
  based chemotherapeutic drug.
- The best understood mechanism of cisplatin action involves crosslinking of DNA base,
  often with guanine, and this DNA lesion triggers inhibition of DNA replication and
  induction of apoptosis, leading cell death upon unrepairable DNA damage (Bauer et
  al., 1978; Heiger-Bernays et al., 1990).
- Carboplatin and oxaliplatin are also platinum-based analogs that act by forming
  DNA crosslinks as well (Richards and Rodger, 2007).
- Cisplatin was first approved by FDA in 1978 for the treatment of testicular and
  bladder cancers and has been widely used for a broad spectrum of cancers including
  testicular, bladder, ovarian, cervical, lung, and head and neck cancers (Park et
  al., 2012).
- Many tumors are initially responsive to cisplatin treatment; however, the majority
  of cancer patients eventually relapse as disease becomes refractory to cisplatin
  (Martin et al., 2008).
- Therefore, besides the known cytotoxicities of cisplatin in the kidney, ears, and
  peripheral nerves, the high incidence of developing resistance to cisplatin is the
  main challenge to the clinical use of cisplatin as an anticancer drug (Martin et
  al., 2008).
- Many mechanisms of cisplatin resistance have been proposed including alteration
  in cellular uptake and efflux of drug (cellular concentration of drug), increased
  metabolism of the drug (drug inactivation and/or elimination), increased DNA repair
  (elimination of DNA adducts), and inhibition of apoptosis (Stordal et al., 2007).
- Cisplatin resistance also relates with the altered activation of signaling pathways
  that may lead to increase cell survival (Galluzzi et al., 2012).
- Curcumin was treated in combination with cisplatin to reverse the cisplatin resistance
  and/or to enhance the efficacy of cisplatin in different types of cancer.
- Many molecular mechanisms of anticancer effect of curcumin have been reported, and
  they were implicated with chemosensitizing mechanisms of curcumin to cisplatin.
- One of the well-appreciated anticancer mechanisms of curcumin involves inhibition
  of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain- enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) activation
  (Hatcher et al., 2008).
- NF-κB is a transcription factor that activates gene transcripts involving resistance
  to apoptosis (X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein, cellular inhibitor of apoptosis
  protein-1, Bcl-2, and Bcl- xL), and cell cycle regulators (cyclin D1 and c-Myc)
  upon translocation to the nucleus.
- High activation of NF-κB is reported in many cancer types (Dolcet et al., 2005).
- Thus, co-treatment of curcumin with the existing chemotherapeutic drugs becomes
  an attractive strategy to treat tumors with high expression of NF-κB or IκB kinase
  (IKK) that subsequently allows translocation of NF-κB.
- J Korean Soc Appl Biol Chem (2014) 57(2), 273−280 275 Hartojo et al.
- (2010) reported that curcumin effectively reduced NF-κB activity and increased apoptosis
  in esophageal adenocarcinoma cells (Hartojo et al., 2010).
- Curcumin (10 or 20 mM) made “an additive effect” on induction of apoptosis in esophageal
  adenocarcinoma cell treated in combination with cisplatin, suggesting potential
  complementary mechanisms of activating apoptosis pathways by two compounds (Hartojo
  et al., 2010).
- In another study, it was demonstrated that curcumin and cisplatin induced apoptosis
  through different mechanisms - curcumin induced apoptosis through inhibition of
  IKKb expression and subsequent suppression of NF-κB activation, whereas cisplatin
  enhanced apoptosis in p53-dependent pathway in head and squamous cell carcinoma
  (HNSCC) cells (Duarte et al., 2010).
- In agreement with in vitro results, co-treatment of curcumin and subtherapeutic
  dose of cisplatin significantly inhibited tumor growth compared to treatment of
  individual agent alone (Duarte et al., 2010).
- Potentiation of anticancer effect of cisplatin by curcumin could be also mediated
  through inhibition of signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT-3)
  proteins, another important transcription factor that activates genes that increase
  cell survival.
- STAT family proteins are phosphorylated and activated by receptor- associated kinases
  in response to various cytokines and growth factors (Yu et al., 2009).
- Activated STAT proteins translocate to the cell nucleus, where they act as transcription
  activators and mediate the expression of a variety of genes.
- Among known seven STAT family proteins, STAT-3 is the most appreciated in the pathogenesis
  of cancer (Jing and Tweardy, 2005).
- Upon activation, STAT-3 transcriptionally activates genes that inhibit apoptosis
  (Bcl-xL, Mcl-1), regulate cell cycle (cyclin D1, c-Myc), and induces angiogenesis
  (vascular endothelial growth factor) (Jing and Tweardy, 2005).
- In contrast to the transient nature of STAT- 3 activation in normal cells, STAT-3
  is constitutively activated in many cancers and therefore making a good target for
  anticancer agent (Jing and Tweardy, 2005).
- Treatment of curcumin-derived liposomal FLLL32 at IC 50 level (&lt;2 µM) inhibited
  phosphorylation of STAT-3 in HNSCC cells (Abuzeid et al., 2011).
- Combinational treatment of FLLL32 and cisplatin at near IC 50 of individual agent
  enhanced apoptosis compared to treatment of individual drug alone, allowing a similar
  or enhanced anticancer effect at lower dose of cisplatin (&lt;5 µM) (Abuzeid et
  al., 2011).
- Curcumin analogue of HO-3867 also reversed cisplatin resistance through down-regulation
  of STAT-3 signaling pathway in ovarian cancer (Selvendiran et al., 2011).
- Interestingly, STAT-3 was highly activated in cisplatin-resistant cancer cells compared
  to sensitive parent lines (Selvendiran et al., 2011).
- Combinational treatment of cisplatin (&lt;35 µM) and HO-3867 (&lt;10 µM) significantly
  inhibited constitutive activation of STAT-3 compared to cisplatin treatment alone
  in ovarian tumor xenografts (Selvendiran et al., 2011).
- Activation of Akt and Notch is also known to mediate tumorigenesis and resistance
  to therapeutic drugs including platinum-based drugs by enhancing cell survival (Wang
  et al., 2008).
- Some studies also suggested that curcumin may resensitize cisplatin-resistant cells
  through suppression of Akt or Notch signaling (Weir et al., 2007; Howells et al.,
  2011).
- These studies indicated that co-treatment of curcumin may potentiate the effect
  of cisplatin or reverse the drug resistance by modulating transcription factor activities
  that increase cell survival and thereby, result in enhancement of apoptosis induced
  by cisplatin.
- However, these studies did not clearly demonstrate the cause and effect relationship
  between curcumin-induced suppression of cell survival pathways and chemosensitization
  of curcumin to cisplatin.
- Chanvorachote et al.
- (2009) suggested mechanisms that curcumin directly regulates apoptosis rather than
  modulates activation of transcriptional factors.
- In their study, curcumin induced proteasomal degradation of Bcl-2, a major anti-apoptotic
  protein, resulting in down- regulation of Bcl-2 and sensitizing Bcl-2 overexpressing
  non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells to cisplatin-induced apoptosis (Chanvorachote
  et al., 2009).
- This novel mechanism of apoptosis regulation by curcumin may also mediate chemosensitizing
  effect of curcumin.
- Cisplatin-sensitizing effect of curcumin was also achieved by inhibiting DNA repair.
- DNA repair is an important mechanism for prevention of cancer by correcting damaged
  DNA in normal cells.
- However, high activation of DNA repair can interfere with the action of drugs that
  induce DNA damage.
- Therefore, it has been challenged to treat cancer cells with intact DNA damage response
  (DDR) and overexpression of DNA repair enzymes such as excision repair cross-complementary
  1 (ERCC1) (Martin et al., 2008).
- Treatment of curcumin at the range of 5-40 µM down- regulated ERCC1 at mRNA and
  protein levels through inactivation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase1/2
  (MKK1/2), extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) signaling in NSCLC
  (Tsai et al., 2011).
- Ogiwara et al.
- (2013) reported that curcumin suppressed DDR response by inhibition of DNA damage
  checkpoint and DNA double-strand break repair.
- Therefore, curcumin can lower the dose of cisplatin with similar or enhanced cytotoxicity
  perhaps mainly through the ability of curcumin to suppress survival signaling pathways
  and cellular DNA repair, concordantly increasing apoptosis in the cisplatin-treated
  cells.
- Doxorubicin Doxorubicin also termed adriamycin is an anthracycline anticancer drug
  that has been used as first-line therapy for many types of cancer (Fornari et al.,
  1994).
- Doxorubicin acts by interacting with DNA - intercalation between two base pairs
  of the DNA (Fornari et al., 1994).
- Intercalation with DNA prevents the progression of topoisomerase II that relaxes
  supercoiled DNA, resulting in DNA double strand breaks (Fornari et al., 1994).
- In response to double strand breaks, normally DDR is activated to repair the DNA
  damage but failure of repair triggers apoptosis (Forrest et al., 2012).
- Doxorubicin-induced DNA damage more rapidly affects replicating cells such as cancer
  cells than normal cells as is the case with other traditional chemotherapeutic drugs.
- In addition, 276 J Korean Soc Appl Biol Chem (2014) 57(2), 273−280 Pang et al.
- (2013) demonstrated a novel mechanism of doxorubicin action.
- Doxorubicin induces histone eviction from chromatin that contributes to deregulation
  of DDR, making cancer cells more susceptible to DNA-damaging agents (Pang et al.,
  2013).
- Doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity is well recognized, although its mechanism remains
  unclear (Latorre et al., 2012).
- Doxorubicin can produce fatal cardiac toxicity with increasing dose that results
  in dose limitation in the use of doxorubicin (Orhan, 1999).
- In addition, intrinsic and acquired resistance to doxorubicin is common.
- The most common mechanism is overexpression of P- glycoprotein, a membrane pump
  responsible for drug efflux, reducing drug concentration inside the cell (Slovak
  et al., 1988).
- Another member of membrane pump, breast cancer related protein, also contributes
  to resistance against doxorubicin (Calcagno et al., 2008).
- Other mechanisms involved in drug resistance are alterations in DNA damage-sensing,
  repair capability of cancer cells, and alteration in apoptosis signaling (Luqmani,
  2005).
- Reduced topoisomerase II expression is another major factor that attributes to doxorubicin
  resistance (Burgess et al., 2008).
- In addition, HuR, the RNA binding protein, has been suggested to be involved in
  resistance to doxorubicin (Latorre et al., 2012).
- HuR acts as an mRNA stabilizer and/or a translational enhancer that binds to a large
  AU-rich element containing mRNAs (Latorre et al., 2012).
- Upon exposure to doxorubicin, HuR translocates into the cytoplasm, which was necessary
  for the doxorubicin-induced apoptosis in a breast cancer cell line, MCF-7 cells
  (Latorre et al., 2012).
- Doxorubicin-resistant cell presented lower expression of HuR and restoration of
  HuR expression sensitized to the drug (Latorre et al., 2012).
- Cancer cells often exhibit multifactorial nature in drug resistance and this was
  reinforced in the study of AbuHammad and Zihlif (2013).
- Analysis on gene expression change associated with the doxorubicin-resistant phenotype
  in a breast cancer cell line revealed alteration in a broad range of genes involved
  in drug metabolism (especially the CYP1A1 and the CYP1A2), drug efflux, topoisomerase
  II expression, cell cycle, apoptosis, and DNA repair (AbuHammad and Zihlif, 2013).
- High activation of NF-κB was also implicated in resistance to doxorubicin although
  it remains controversial whether NF-κB activation is required for doxorubicin-induced
  apoptosis or oppositely makes resistant to the drug-induced apoptosis.
- However, it seems to be consistent that cells exposed to doxorubicin elevate NF-κB
  activation.
- Doxorubicin treatment induced transcriptional repression and degradation of IκBα
  that resulted in activation of NF-κB and increase of Bcl-2 transcription to impart
  survival advantage to drug-resistant cells (Sen et al., 2011).
- Curcumin was evaluated for doxorubicin sensitizing potential primarily through its
  ability to suppress NF-κB activation.
- Compared to doxorubicin treatment (&lt;4 µM) alone, pretreatment of curcumin (10
  µM) effectively reduced cell viability in doxorubicin-resistant breast cancer cells
  (Sen et al., 2011).
- Curcumin inhibited NF-κB activation in drug- resistant cells and this inhibition
  allowed p53-depenent activation of apoptosis, thereby sensitizing doxorubicin (Sen
  et al., 2011).
- Consistently, NF-κB activation induced by doxorubicin was attenuated by curcumin
  co-treatment in hepatoma cell lines (Notarbartolo et al., 2005).
- In agreement with in vitro findings, curcumin and doxorubicin combinational treatment
  exhibited greater inhibitory effect on the growth of tumor bearing doxorubicin-
  resistant ovarian sarcoma cells compared to single treatment of doxorubicin (Sadzuka
  et al., 2012).
- This study also demonstrated a simultaneous decrease in drug-induced systemic toxicity
  by curcumin, suggesting that reduction of adverse effect by curcumin might also
  contribute to enhancement of doxorubicin efficacy (Sadzuka et al., 2012).
- Hence, previous studies suggested that curcumin may potentiate doxorubicin efficacy
  by altering NF-κB activation and decreasing drug toxicity.
- Unfortunately, these studies did not elucidate cause and effect relationship between
  curcumin-induced suppression of NF-κB activation and the enhancement of doxorubicin
  efficacy by curcumin.
- 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) Antimetabolites represent a class of anticancer drugs that
  mimic normal cellular molecules (i.e., purine and pyrimidine analogs) and consequently
  interfere with DNA replication (Murakami et al., 2000).
- 5-FU is a pyrimidine analog that also includes capecitabine (an oral prodrug of
  5-FU), floxuridine, and gemcitabine (Sikic, 1999).
- The incorporation of purine and pyrimidine analogs into DNA during S-phase of cell
  cycle prevents proper nucleotide addition, causing DNA replication failure (Major
  et al., 1982).
- 5- FU can be incorporated into DNA or RNA in place of thymine or uracil, respectively,
  and prevents the addition of the next nucleotide due to a fluoride atom at the 5-carbon
  position on the ring, resulting in termination of chain elongation and consequently
  induction of apoptosis (Parker and Cheng, 1990).
- 5-FU also initiates apoptosis by targeting thymidylate synthase (TS), a rate- limiting
  enzyme in production of deoxythymidine triphosphate (Ghoshal and Jacob, 1997; Longley
  et al., 2003).
- 5-FU forms a covalent ternary complex with 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate and TS,
  resulting in inhibition of DNA synthesis (Santi et al., 1974).
- However, prolonged exposure to 5-FU appeared to increase the expression of TS, making
  free TS available for DNA synthesis (Vinod et al., 2013).
- Not surprisingly, several studies have demonstrated strong association between increased
  TS expression and development of resistance to 5-FU (Chu et al., 1993; Hu et al.,
  2003).
- Yoo et al (2009) reported that elevation of astrocyte elevated gene-1 (AEG-1) was
  related with 5-FU resistance in hepatocellular carcinoma through its capability
  of inducing LSF transcription factor that regulates TS transcription (Yoo et al.,
  2009).
- In addition, AEG-1 increased dihydrophyrimidine dehydrogenase that inactivates 5-FU
  by catalyzing conversion of 5-FU to inactive fluoro-5,6-dihyrouracil, augmenting
  5-FU resistance (Yoo et al., 2009).
- In contrast, Wang et al.
- (2004) did not observe apparent increase of TS expression in 5-FU-resistant lines
  when they compared expression profiles of pairs of 5-FU resistant and drug-sensitive
  parental cancer cells.
- Cells resistant to J Korean Soc Appl Biol Chem (2014) 57(2), 273−280 277 5-FU exhibited
  phenotypes of slower growth, higher proportion of G 1, and lower proportion of S
  phase that may allow time to repair when 5-FU is incorporated into DNA chain and
  protect cells from death triggered by 5-FU-induced DNA damage (Wang et al., 2004).
- Cells irresponsive to 5-FU consistently exhibited high expression of p65 (NF-κB
  subunit) at both mRNA and protein levels.
- Furthermore, p65 in resistant cells had high DNA binding and transcriptional activities,
  suggesting that high activation of NF-κB signaling pathway plays an important role
  in 5-FU resistance (Wang et al., 2004).
- Possible combinational use of curcumin with 5-FU have been studied in different
  cancers.
- In these studies, NF-κB inhibitory effect of curcumin was implicated as a major
  molecular mechanism underlying chemosensitization of 5-FU by curcumin.
- Relatively high concentration of curcumin (50 µM) effectively suppressed the constitutively
  active NF-κB in esophageal squamous carcinoma cells through the inhibition of IκBα
  phosphorylation, subsequently down-regulating the NF-κB-regulated genes, Bcl-2 and
  cyclin D1 (Tian et al., 2012a).
- The same group also reported that effect of curcumin (50 µM) was comparable or superior
  to p65 siRNA in inhibition of p65 expression and IκBα phosphorylation, leading reduction
  of cell viability and enhancement of apoptosis in esophageal squamous carcinoma
  cells (Tian et al., 2012b).
- Curcumin also effectively sensitized colon cancer cells to 5-FU treatment with more
  physiologically achievable dose.
- Pretreatment of 5 µM curcumin reduced the amount of 5-FU by 5-fold compared to IC
  50 of 5-FU in order to achieve the same cytotoxicity in colon cancer cells (Shakibaei
  et al., 2013).
- This synergistic effect of curcumin and 5-FU was related with collaborative alteration
  of apoptosis- regulatory proteins including caspase-8, caspase-9, caspase-3, Bax,
  and Bcl-xL in both colon cancer cells in vitro and their xenografts (Shakibaei et
  al., 2013).
- Furthermore, this potentiation of anticancer effect of 5-FU in the presence of curcumin
  was associated with curcumin-induced suppression of NF-κB and phosphoinositide 3-kinase
  signaling activated by 5-FU (Shakibaei et al., 2013).
- More comprehensive mechanistic study that involves curcumin- mediated chemosensitization
  to 5-FU was conducted by Vinod et al.
- (2013).
- Curcumin synergized cytotoxicity induced by 5-FU treatment in breast cancer cells
  regardless of their estrogen and progesterone receptor status (Vinod et al., 2013).
- This synergizing effect of curcumin involves the ability of curcumin to inhibit
  NF- κB activation and degradation of IκBα induced by 5-FU, subsequently enhancing
  5-FU-induced apoptosis through caspase- dependent cleavage of poly ADP ribose polymerase
  (PARP) (Vinod et al., 2013).
- Interestingly, TS was upstream regulator of NF- κB activation in breast cancer cells
  exposed to 5-FU (Vinod et al., 2013).
- 5-FU treatment induced TS expression and curcumin pretreatment significantly down-regulated
  5-FU-induced up- regulation of TS (Vinod et al., 2013).
- Therefore, enhancement of 5-FU anticancer effect was also mainly through modulating
  NF- κB activation.
- Gemcitabine Gemcitabine (2'-deoxy-2',2'-difluorocytidine monohydrochloride) is a
  fluorinated analog of deoxycytidine that can be incorporated into DNA during DNA
  replication, causing inhibition of DNA synthesis and apoptosis (Noble and Goa, 1997).
- It also inhibits ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) involved in deoxyribonucleotide
  synthesis required for DNA synthesis; thereby inhibiting RNR by gemcitabine induces
  apoptosis (Artin et al., 2009).
- Gemcitabine has been used as a first-line treatment for patients with advanced or
  metastatic pancreatic cancer; however, the disease develops resistance to the drug
  (Skrypek et al., 2013).
- Cellular mechanisms responsible for resistance to gemcitabine are less understood.
- High activation of ERK appeared to be implicated in gemcitabine resistance, although
  studies did not demonstrate definitive causality (Fryer et al., 2011).
- ERK was highly activated in pancreatic cancer cell lines that exhibit high degree
  of resistance to gemcitabine (Fryer et al., 2011).
- Zheng et al.
- (2013) also suggested that high ERK activity may protect pancreatic cancer cells
  from gemcitabine- induced apoptosis.
- Moreover, Skrypek et al.
- (2013) demonstrated that the MUC4 mucin mediates gemcitabine resistance in pancreatic
  cancer cells, and MUC4 induced gemcitabine resistance by regulating the expression
  of nucleoside transporters (hCNT1) and ratio of apoptosis-related proteins, Bax/Bcl-xL.
- Interestingly, NF-κB was shown to mediate the regulation of hCNT1 expression by
  MUC4.
- NF-κB activation down-regulated the hCNT1 expression, resulting in decreased gemcitabine
  uptake and efficiency (Skrypek et al., 2013).
- In addition, regulation of Bax/Bcl-xL ratio by MUC4 was mediated through the NF-κB
  (Skrypek et al., 2013).
- Furthermore, they reported that decreased expression of NF-κB led to increased sensitivity
  to gemcitabine, suggesting potential improvement of gemcitabine efficacy by targeting
  the NF-κB pathway with natural or chemical inhibitors.
- Curcumin was tested for potential combinational use to enhance the effect of gemcitabine
  or overcome chemoresistance to the drug.
- Curcumin (10 or 50 µM) inhibited constitutive NF-κB activation in pancreatic cancer
  cell lines (Kunnumakkara et al., 2007).
- Co-treatment of curcumin (10 µM) and gemcitabine (50 nM) effectively enhanced cytotoxicity
  and apoptosis at the concentrations of individual compounds that were minimally
  effective (Kunnumakkara et al., 2007).
- The same study also validated potentiation of gemcitabine effect by curcumin in
  orthotopic pancreatic tumor model.
- This synergistic effect of curcumin was related with inhibition of NF-κB activation
  and subsequent down-regulation of NF-κB-regulated proteins including VEGF, cyclooxygenase-2,
  cyclin D1, c-Myc, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and c-IAP-1 (Kunnumakkara et al., 2007).
- Similarly, difluorinated curcumin (CDF), a synthetic analogue of curcumin, synergized
  gemcitabine effect in pancreatic cancer but with lower concentration due to greater
  bioavailability of CDF compared to the parent compound.
- Combinational treatment of CDF (4 mM) and gemcitabine (10 nM) greatly decreased
  cell viability in consistence 278 J Korean Soc Appl Biol Chem (2014) 57(2), 273−280
  with increased apoptosis and suppression of NF-κB activation (Ali et al., 2010).
- They also reported that CDF either by itself or combined with gemcitabine significantly
  down-regulated miR-21 that is overexpressed in gemcitabine-resistant cells.
- Interestingly, down-regulation of miR-21 correlated with reactivation of phosphatase
  and tensin homolog (PTEN) that induces the cell cycle arrest.
- Likewise, CDF restores PTEN expression in colon cancer cells through down-regulation
  of miR-21 (Ali et al., 2010).
- Thus, curcumin increased gemcitabine efficacy by suppression of NF-κB activation
  and reactivation of PTEN.
- Conclusions The development of cancer chemotherapy made a significant progress in
  cancer treatment.
- However, both traditional and targeted chemotherapeutic drugs are challenged by
  drug-induced toxicity and resistance to drug in spite of tremendous effort to improve
  therapy.
- Combination therapy has been suggested as a strategy to avoid therapeutic drug resistance
  while cutting down the drug-derived toxicity by lowering the dose of each drug.
- Many food bioactive compounds have exhibited anticancer activity and can be good
  candidates for combination therapy as well.
- For successful combination therapy, however, it is important to identify molecular
  mechanisms of each compound and combine two or more agents that work together in
  complementary or synergistic ways.
- Main obstacle of using food compounds in combination therapy might be that their
  mechanisms of anticancer actions are less understood, making difficult to establish
  strategies to combine with available therapeutic drugs or other bioactive food compounds.
- Curcumin is one of food compounds that exert anticancer activity in many types of
  cancer and has been extensively studied for its mechanisms of anticancer action.
- In addition, there are efforts to enhance bioavailability of curcumin by modifying
  curcumin structure and liposomal delivery (Ali et al., 2010; Abuzeid et al., 2011).
- Combinational treatment of curcumin enhanced therapeutic efficacy of chemotherapeutic
  drugs, cisplatin, doxorubicin, 5-FU, and gemcitabine.
- NF-κB is a major downstream effector that leads to chemoresistance of many therapeutic
  drugs.
- Down-regulation of NF-κB by curcumin is an effective mechanism to sensitize to the
  drugs.
- Therefore, combinational use of curcumin and available anticancer drugs has great
  potential to enhance chemotherapy efficacy and improve clinical treatment of cancer.
- More studies will be required to elucidate cause effect relationship of curcumin-induced
  suppression of cell survival pathways and enhancement of drug efficacy by curcumin.
