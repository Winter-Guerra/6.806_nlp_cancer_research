text: [Green tea contains catechins and other polyphenols that are thought to be responsible
    for its anti-cancer properties., 'Important green tea polyphenols include epigallocatechin-3-gallate,
    epicatechin, epigallocatechin, and epicatechin-3-gallate.', EGCG has been shown
    to inhibit tumor growth and angiogenesis of estrogen receptor positive  breast
    cancer in mice without affecting normal tissue growth., 'EGCG also has been found
    to inhibit growth and induce apoptosis of HER2/neu overexpressing  breast cancer
    cells, including those resistant to Herceptin.', Green tea polyphenols have been
    found to inhibit the transformation of normal breast cells into breast cancer
    cells in a laboratory model of carcinogenesis induced by long-term exposure to
    low levels of environmental carcinogens., 'In addition, EGCG has been shown to
    reduce the growth and induce apoptosis of the stem-like inflammatory breast cancer  cells.',
  'EGCG has been shown to synergistically enhance the growth inhibition of ER+ cells
    by tamoxifen and Taxol, thereby increasing the effectiveness of such therapy.',
  'In addition, green tea extract has been found to protect against tamoxifen-induced
    liver injury in rats.', Green tea intake has been found to enhance the inhibitory
    effects of Adriamycin  in Ehrlich ascites carcinoma tumor-bearing mice and in
    ovarian cancer cells., Green tea polyphenols have been shown to have potentiating
    effect on cisplatin chemotherapy in a mouse cervical cancer model  breast cancer).,
  The kaempferol content of green tea might help protect against Adriamycin-induced
    heart damage., 'However, green tea might reduce the effectiveness of Adriamycin
    and other anthracycline chemotherapy due to its caffeine content.', Numerous population
    studies have found that heavy green tea consumption is associated with lower risk
    of breast cancer., There is also some evidence that green tea consumption might
    help prevent recurrence in early stage  breast cancers.]
