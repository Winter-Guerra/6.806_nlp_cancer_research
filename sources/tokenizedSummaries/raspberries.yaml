[Raspberry powder has been shown to have antiproliferative effects when fed to female
    rats prone to mammary tumors., Black raspberries appear to have more cancer-preventative
    chemicals than the closely-related red raspberries., 'Studies that have compared
    blueberry and black raspberry diets in rats have found that while blueberries
    result in lower tumor volume than black raspberries, black raspberries are more
    effective in delaying the first appearance of tumors in rats implanted with estradiol.',
  'Ellagic acid, found in raspberries, has been shown to inhibit breast cancer in
    cell and animal studies, in part by inhibiting angiogenesis.', "Cancer cells induce\
    \ angiogenesis during the early stages of tumor development \x97 this is a crucial\
    \ step that separates preinvasive and dormant forms of cancer from invasive and\
    \ metastatic malignant growth."]
