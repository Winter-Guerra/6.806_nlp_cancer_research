['Coffee drinking has been reported to have either a small positive or negative association
    with breast cancer risk, or no association at all, in the general population.',
  'However, the body''s reaction to coffee can vary significantly for different women
    based on genetic differences and other factors.', Large population studies tend
    to mask such individual differences by combining results of subgroups for whom
    coffee drinking may reduce breast cancer risk with subgroups for whom coffee may
    increase risk., 'One study found that, for women with benign breast disease, statistically
    significant positive correlations existed between caffeine consumption and hormone
    receptor negative (ER-/PR-) disease, as well as breast tumors greater than 2 cm
    in size.', The implication is that coffee drinking should be avoided by women
    with fibrocystic breast disease., 'Several studies have found that among women
    with BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutations, heavy coffee consumption is associated with
    significantly reduced breast cancer risk.', 'However, a 2013 study reported that
    increased breast cancer risk was found for BRCA1 mutation carriers who were heavy
    coffee drinkers.', 'The effect of coffee consumption on breast cancer risk depends
    in part on her CYP1A2 genotype, whether or not she is a BRCA carrier.', The CYP1A2
    gene plays a crucial role in the metabolism of both estrogen and coffee., 'Like
    BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, a woman''s CYP1A2 genotype can only be determined through
    genetic testing and this testing is not normally performed.', 'Regular heavy coffee
    consumption increases the expression of the CYP1A2 gene, which encodes a member
    of the cytochrome P450 family of enzymes.', Coffee has been found to protect C-allele
    carriers against breast cancer by reducing breast volume., Coffee consumption
    has also been shown to slow the growth of ER+ tumors in women with the CYP1A21F
    A/A genotype., 'One Swedish study found that coffee consumption was associated
    with a reduction in the risk of breast cancer for lean women, whereas it appeared
    to have the opposite effect in heavy women.', Studies that have attempted to study
    the possible influence of coffee consumption on risk of breast cancer according
    to menopausal status have produced conflicting results., 'Heavy coffee drinking
    has variously been reported to increase, reduce or have no association with breast
    cancer risk among premenopausal women.', Coffee has been linked to reduced breast
    cancer risk or no association with risk in postmenopausal women., Studies that
    have attempted to study the possible influence of coffee consumption on risk of
    breast cancer according to hormone receptor status have also produced inconsistent
    results., Several studies have reported results that are suggestive of a possible
    association between heavy coffee drinking and increased risk of ER- breast cancer
    in premenopausal women., 'However, several studies have reported that coffee drinking
    is associated with reduced risk of ER- breast cancer in postmenopausal women.',
  One Swedish study specifically reported that coffee consumption is associated with
    reduced risk of ER+/PR- disease., 'Regularly consuming at least two cups of coffee
    per day might increase the effectiveness of tamoxifen treatment, according to
    recent research.', 'Acrylamide, a chemical contained in coffee, among other foods,
    is a suspected carcinogen.', 'Numerous studies have examined the association between
    acrylamide and breast cancer, with mostly inconclusive or negative results.',
  'However, a 2012 Danish study reported that pre-diagnostic exposure to acrylamide
    was associated with increased mortality among breast cancer patients with ER+
    breast cancer.', Coffee might reduce the effectiveness of Adriamycin (doxorubicin)
    and other anthracycline chemotherapy because of its caffeine content., There is
    also some preliminary evidence that coffee could reduce the effectiveness of Taxol
    (paclitaxel) and other taxane chemotherapy as a result of its caffeic acid content.]
