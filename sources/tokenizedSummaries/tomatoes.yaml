text: ['Tomatoes are a rich source of the carotenoids lycopene, alpha-carotene, and
    beta-carotene, as well as melatonin, the anthocyanidin delphinidin, and the flavanoids
    quercetin, fisetin and naringenin, all of which have been found to have anti-cancer
    activities.', 'Tomatoes have been shown to have anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory,
    antimutagenic, and cardioprotective properties.', Increased intake of tomatoes
    is associated with decreased cardiovascular disease and reduced risk of heart
    attack., 'Tomato consumption has been found to be associated with reduced risks
    of cancer of the mouth, breast, lung, stomach, pancreas, prostate, colon, ovary,
    and endometrium.', 'However, tomatoes or lycopene have been shown not to have
    significant anticancer effects on renal cell, uterine, ovarian, and bladder cancers.',
  'A number of studies have found an inverse association between breast cancer risk
    and increasing consumption of tomatoes, components of tomatoes, or vegetables
    that have high levels of carotenoids.', 'For example, one study comprising 84,805
    postmenopausal women in the Womens Health Initiative Observational Study found
    that dietary -carotene, -carotene, and lycopene were each found to be inversely
    associated with the risk of ER+/PR+ breast cancer.', 'Another study found that
    dietary carotenoids inhibit the cancer-promoting effects of both estradiol and
    genistein, thereby reducing their harmful effect in hormone-dependent breast cancer.',
  'Studies of naringenin, a tomato flavanone, have shown that it also inhibits ER+
    breast cancer cell growth and migration in the presence of estradiol.', 'Delphinidin,
    an anthocyanin found in tomatoes, has been shown to block epidermal growth factor
    receptor  signaling in breast cancer cells.', 'However, one large study found
    no association between dietary or plasma lycopene levels and the risk of breast
    cancer in middle-aged and older women.', Several studies of early-stage breast
    cancer survivors have found that higher levels of cartenoids in the blood are
    associated with both lower risk of break cancer recurrence and lower risk of a
    new primary breast tumor., Another study found that plasma levels of retinol  also
    are positively associated with breast cancer survival in postmenopausal women.,
  'As noted above, tomatoes are a good dietary source of melatonin.', 'Melatonin protects
    against breast cancer in several ways, including by reducing aromatase activity
    within the breast, thereby reducing estrogen production.', Several studies have
    shown that the cardioprotective effect of tomatoes and lycopene extends to reducing
    the impact of myocardial toxicity from Adriamycin  chemotherapy by ameliorating
    cardiac cell injury., 'Cherry tomatoes rank the highest of all tomatoes in lycopene
    and overall antioxidant content, presumably because of their high ratio of tomato
    skin to tomato flesh and rich color.', 'However, lycopene is absorbed in greater
    quantities from cooked tomatoes than fresh tomatoes.', The best sources of bioavailable
    lycopene are tomato paste and tomato sauce., Frying greatly reduces the lycopene
    content of fresh tomatoes., 'While tomato ketchup has a relatively low overall
    carotenoid content compared to fresh tomatoes or tomato sauce, it is a good source
    of lycopene.', 'However, note that high fructose corn syrup is the second most
    abundant ingredient in regular ketchup and that versions without this ingredient
    are available.', 'Sun dried tomatoes contain relatively high levels of copper,
    which could contribute to angiogenesis and metastasis of breast cancer.', 'Ready-made
    tomato soups can have high levels of sodium nitrite, a known carcinogen.', Check
    the labels of canned or otherwise pre-made soups and avoid those containing sodium
    nitrite., The table salt content of such soups can also be acceptably high for
    those who must limit their sodium intake., 'Beta carotene, vitamin A and lycopene
    should be obtained from food rather than supplements.', 'Generally speaking, synergistic
    interactions between the biologically active components in a given fruit or vegetable
    are important to its potential health-related characteristics.', Supplementation
    by -carotene and lycopene both have been found to be ineffective in reducing the
    risk of breast cancer., 'In addition, -carotene supplementation has been linked
    to increased risk of lung cancer in high-risk persons and high serum -carotene
    concentrations  have been associated with increased risk of aggressive prostate
    cancer.', Below are links to recent studies concerning this food., 'For a more
