text: [Most of the population-based breast cancer studies performed to date that specifically
    included pumpkins were conducted in Japan., 'One Japanese study found that consuming
    vegetables  reduced the risk of gastric, breast, lung and colorectal cancer, regardless
    of the family history of cancer.', Another Japanese study found reductions in
    breast cancer risk associated with high intakes of green-yellow vegetables  among
    both premenopausal and postmenopausal women.]
