text: ['The relationship between salt and cancer is related to two types of salt intake:
    high overall intake and high intake of very salty foods.', 'The relatively high
    overall level of salt in the average U.S. diet contributes to cancer risk indirectly
    by promoting metabolic syndrome and reducing the potassium/sodium ratio in the
    diet, both of which are thought to increase the risks of various cancers.', 'The
    second type of cancer-promoting salt intake occurs when people consume highly
    salted specialty foods, condiments and snacks.', These foods act directly on the
    digestive track and have been shown in numerous studies to cause stomach  cancer.,
  'Implicated foods include dried and salted fish and seafood, fermented/pickled vegetables,
    fish sauce, kimchi, salted preserved vegetables, salted and fermented soybean
    paste, salted fish preserves, salted fish roe, salted meat, salted shrimp paste,
    salty snacks, and salty soups.', 'Many of the foods listed above are Asian; since
    the rate of stomach cancer is relatively high in Asia, there has been great interest
    in investigating the causes.', 'Note however, that European and South American
    studies also have found associations between heavily salted foods and stomach
    cancer.', There is some evidence that breast cancer survivors are at increased
    risk of developing stomach cancer and lobular breast cancer survivors in particular
    are vulnerable to gastric metastases.]
