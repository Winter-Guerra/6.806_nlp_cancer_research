text: [Our conclusion that eating tofu could be beneficial is based on the available
    epidemiological evidence concerning tofu consumption and breast cancer incidence.,
  'Separate web pages cover soybean paste, soybean oil, soy protein isolate and soybeans.',
  We attempt to untangle the conflicting findings concerning soybeans and their component
    phytoestrogens and breast cancer in the genistein and daidzein web page., 'Population
    studies have found that high tofu intake is associated with lower risk of breast
    cancer, especially for pre-menopausal women.', Childhood consumption of tofu appears
    to enhance the protective effect of tofu in premenopausal women., 'Most of the
    studies concerning tofu consumption and risk of breast cancer have been conducted
    among Asian or Asian-American women, raising the possibility that tofu consumption
    is a marker for other protective aspects of Asian diets or lifestyles.', 'However,
    one North American study not focused on soyfoods or Asian cases found tofu consumption
    to be associated with lower risk of premenopausal bilateral breast cancer.']
