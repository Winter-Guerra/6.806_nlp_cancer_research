text: [Higher red meat consumption during adolescence by women in the Nurses Health
    Study II has been found to be associated with increased risk of premenopausal
    breast cancer in adulthood., A French population study found that increasing meat
    consumption was associated with increasing breast cancer risk., A UK study found
    that both pre- and postmenopausal women who consumed the most meat  had the highest
    risk of breast cancer., A German study of women under 51 years of age also found
    that breast cancer risk was increased with higher consumption of red meat; women
    with the highest consumption quartile had an 85% elevated breast cancer risk compared
    to the lowest quartile., 'For premenopausal women, the association of meat  intake
    with breast cancer risk was found to be even stronger in this study.', 'A study
    of tissue removed from healthy women undergoing breast reduction surgery found
    that the levels of DNA adducts  in the breast tissue was correlated with the womens
    consumption of fried meat, beef and processed meat.', 'High intake of animal fats
    has been linked in several studies to increased breast density, a risk factor
    for breast cancer and recurrence.', 'A study that included 52,158 postmenopausal
    women reported that, comparing the fifth to the first quintile, red meat, the
    heterocyclic amine  2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazoquinoxaline, and dietary iron each
    were associated with increased risk of breast cancer.', 'Women in the Iowa Womens
    Health Study who consistently ate their hamburgers, steak, and bacon very well
    done were found to have a 4.62 times higher risk of breast cancer than women who
    consumed the meats rare or medium well done.', 'However, not all studies have
    found an association between meat consumption and breast cancer risk.', "A number
    of different factors and mechanisms have been proposed to account for the findings
    of increased breast cancer risk associated with beef consumption:\n\n   The U.S.
    beef and veal industry uses zeranol, a non-steroidal substance with estrogenic
    activity, as a growth promoter.", Zeranol has been found to stimulate human breast
    cancer cell growth and proliferation., Other growth promoters  that are routinely
    administered to cattle also are suspected to contribute to breast cancer risk.,
  'Irradiation of beef, which is widespread in the U.S., has been found to result
    in the formation of alkylcyclobutanones, which have been shown to have mutagenic
    and tumor promoting activities.', Red meat intake has been shown reduce circulating
    melatonin., 'Melatonin protects against breast cancer in several ways, including
    by reducing aromatase activity within the breast, thereby reducing estrogen production.',
  'Bovine leukemia virus, which estimated to infect at least 14% of U.S. beef herds,
    is thought by some observers to be capable of contributing to human breast cancer.',
  'Many women have antibodies to BLV, indicating exposure to the virus.', 'Some of
    the HCAs formed in very well done beef and steak, and in beef gravy, are known
    human carcinogens.', 'Two of the HCAs, 2-amino-3-methylimidazopyridine and 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazopyridine,
    have also been shown to have potent estrogenic activity, inducing activation of
    estrogen-regulated genes, proliferation of estrogen-dependent cells and up-regulation
    of progesterone receptor.', 'While iron deficiency anemia obviously is to be avoided,
    the contribution of significant heme iron in the diet as a result of regularly
    consuming beef could be detrimental for some women.', Iron depletion has been
    shown to lead to significant inhibition of breast cancer cell growth in the laboratory.,
  Relatively high levels of iron in benign breast tissue was found in one prospective
    study to be associated with an increase in risk of subsequent breast cancer.,
  Other studies have found high levels of iron in the blood to be associated with
    increased breast cancer risk., 'If beef or veal is to be consumed, it makes sense
    to buy organic beef to avoid irradiated and growth hormone-treated meat.']
