['Blackberries contain cyandin-3-glucoside, lignans, ellagic acid, the flavonoid myricetin
    and other potentially beneficial substances.', Cyandin-3-glucoside has been shown
    to possess both chemo preventive and chemotherapeutic activity., Postmenopausal
    women with breast cancer and a high intake of plant lignans have been found to
    be less likely to die from their breast cancer than those with a low intake.,
  Ellagic acid has been shown to inhibit cancer formation., Myricetin has antioxidant
    properties., The combination of chemicals in blackberries may more effectively
    prevent cancer than any one of the component chemicals alone.]
