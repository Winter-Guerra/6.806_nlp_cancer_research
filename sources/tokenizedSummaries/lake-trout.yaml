['Like other fatty fish, lake trout is a significant source of the marine omega-3
    fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA).', These
    fatty acids have been shown to inhibit proliferation of breast cancer cells in
    the laboratory., Fish protein hydrolysates also have been shown to have antiproliferative
    activity against human breast cancer cell lines., 'Most, but not all, epidemiological
    studies have found convincing evidence of a negative association between DHA and
    EPA intake or fatty fish consumption and the risk of breast cancer.', 'In addition,
    several studies have found that higher dietary omega-3 to omega-6 fatty acid intakes
    are associated with reduced risk of breast cancer; consuming lake trout would
    tend to improve this ratio for most women.', Marine fatty acids have also been
    found to enhance the therapeutic effects of tamoxifen and chemotherapy drugs such
    as Adriamycin and Taxol., 'However, note that recent research suggests that lake
    trout and similar fish should not be consumed the day before through the day after
    a chemotherapy treatment and consumed only in moderation during the remaining
    days of each cycle.', 'Fish similar to lake trout have been shown to incorporate
    a fatty acid (hexadeca-4,7,10,13-tetraenoic acid) that can induce resistance to
    a broad spectrum of chemotherapy drugs.']
