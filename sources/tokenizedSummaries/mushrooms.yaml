text: ['A case-control study of 1,009 Chinese breast cancer patients found that mushroom
    consumption was inversely related to breast cancer risk.', A study of Korean breast
    cancer patients also found consumption of mushrooms to be associated with a significantly
    decreased risk of breast cancer., Another Korean study found that both high daily
    intake and high consumption frequency of mushrooms was associated with reduced
    risk of breast cancer among postmenopausal women., Many types of mushroom appear
    to have beneficial effects with respect to breast cancer prevention., "The information
    below concerns mushrooms commonly available in the U.S.\n\n   White button mushrooms
    \ are the most common mushrooms sold in supermarkets.", 'They are also known as
    button mushrooms, white mushrooms, or table mushrooms.', Portobello and crimini
    mushrooms are closely related to white button mushrooms., 'Of the mushrooms studied,
    white button mushrooms have among the most powerful proven breast cancer chemopreventive
    properties, since they have been shown to suppress aromatase activity and estrogen
    biosynthesis, in addition to inhibiting proliferation of estrogen receptor positive  breast
    cancer cells.', 'Several studies have concluded that diets high in white button
    mushrooms may lower the risk of estrogen receptor positive breast cancer, especially
    in postmenopausal women, by reducing aromatase activity.', Maitake mushrooms  are
    sold dried or fresh in upscale supermarkets and specialty markets., 'Maitake mushrooms
    have been shown to reduce growth, inhibit angiogenesis, and induce apoptosis of
    human breast cancer cells in the laboratory.', 'However, a 2009 trial of maitake
    mushroom supplementation in postmenopausal breast cancer survivors found that,
    contrary to expectations, the maitake extract had both immune enhancing and immune
    suppressant effects at various doses.', Shiitake mushrooms  are widely available
    fresh or dried in grocery stores and specialty markets., Shiitake mushrooms have
    been found to inhibit increases in tumor volume of human breast cancer cells implanted
    in mice., 'Reishi mushrooms  usually are sold only in powder form in capsules,
    in liquid extracts and as tea, since they are too bitter and tough to be eaten
    as food.', 'Reishi mushroom extracts have been shown to inhibit proliferation,
    adhesion, angiogenesis, migration, and invasion of several types of breast cancer
    cells.', 'The addition of green tea extract to reishi extract has been shown to
    have a synergistic effect in the inhibiting adhesion, migration and invasion of
    hormone receptor negative  breast cancer cells.', 'Reishi extract has been shown
    to be effective in inhibiting inflammatory breast cancer  progression, one of
    the few foods to have demonstrated beneficial impact on this form of the disease.',
  'While reishi mushroom extracts have been shown to have anti-cancer activities against
    ER+/PR+ breast cancer cells, they have also been shown to have estrogenic properties.',
  'Therefore, we would advise those at high risk for breast cancer and those with
    non-IBC ER+ breast cancer against consuming reishi.', 'Generally speaking, we
    would be very cautious about consuming mushroom supplements because safe and effective
    dosages have not been established.']
