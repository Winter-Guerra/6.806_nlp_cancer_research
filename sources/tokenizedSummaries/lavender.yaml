text: ['English lavender  essential oil has been used for centuries to reduce pain,
    combat infection, reduce anxiety and promote relaxation.', 'Like other essential
    oils, lavender essential oil is very concentrated; at least 60 lbs of lavender
    flowers typically are used to make 16 fluid ounces of the oil.', 'The oil is used
    in detergents, baked goods, candles, cosmetics, body powder, massage oil, shampoo,
    soap, perfume, and tea.', It is also an ingredient in some breast enlargement
    pills and creams., Some cancer patients are receiving aromatherapy massage using
    lavender essential oil., 'Lavender essential oil has been shown to have a high
    antioxidant content and a component of lavender, perillyl alcohol, has been studied
    in cancer prevention.', 'However, lavender essential oil  was reported to cause
    breast enlargement in otherwise healthy and normal boys in one well known 2007
    New England Journal of Medicine article.', 'While there have not been any follow
    up studies that confirmed the estrogenic effects of lavender-containing skin products,
    applying lavender creams or oils to the skin appears unwise.', Use of lavender
    products can trigger allergic contact dermatitis and allergic reactions to lavender
    are not uncommon., 'For example, lavender flower satchels placed inside pillowcases
    have been found to cause facial rashes in some individuals.', Lavender baby products
    probably should be avoided., 'Note that while we are continually searching for
    new evidence specifically concerning lavender, there is not much interest in it
    among breast cancer researchers, so few studies are available.']
