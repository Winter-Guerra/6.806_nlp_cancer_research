text: [One study found that a diet high in avocado oil promoted the formation of mammary
    tumors in rats., Another study of postmenopausal U.S. Latina women found that
    consumption of avocados was associated with higher circulating estrogen levels.,
  'On the other hand, a toxin in avocado leaves has been shown to enhance the cytotoxic
    effects of tamoxifen on human breast cancer cells regardless of their estrogen
    receptor  status.', 'Based on the available evidence, breast cancer patients,
    survivors and those at high risk should limit consumption of avocados until further
    studies clarify these findings.']
