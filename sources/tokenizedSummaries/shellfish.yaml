text: ['By shellfish, we mean edible crustaceans and bivalves, including abalone,
    clams, crab, crayfish, lobster, mussels, oysters, prawns, scampi, scallops and
    shrimp.', 'In nature, smaller crustaceans such as shrimp usually are scavengers,
    feeding on very small shellfish and other zooplankton, as well as plant detritus
    and parts of creatures that have fallen to the ocean floor.', 'Larger crustaceans
    such as lobster are more likely to be active predators, consuming smaller fish
    and shellfish.', Bivalves such as clams generally feed by pumping water across
    their gills and trapping phytoplankton., Shellfish are a rich source of protein
    and they contain some marine omega-3 fatty acids., 'The pink coloration of some
    shellfish is due to astaxanthin, a carotenoid derived from algae and phytoplankton
    that has been shown to have anti-oxidant and anti-atherogenic properties and may
    also have chemopreventive properties.', 'Persistently high colorectal cancer rates
    in the European Union are thought to be the result of shellfish consumption, specifically
    shellfish incorporating diarrhetic shellfish poisoning toxins such as okadaic
    acid.', 'A 2009 report from 73,224-participants in the Shanghai Womens Health
    Study also found high shellfish consumption to be associated with increased risk
    of colorectal cancer.', Environmental pollution was thought to be a possible contributing
    factor., Some but not all studies have found an association between fish and shellfish
    consumption and thyroid cancer., One study of Korean 9 to 12 year old girls found
    that breast development was significantly positively associated with consumption
    of shellfish and processed meat., 'Yessotoxin, an algal toxin that can accumulate
    in edible mollusks, has been shown to interfere with the tumor suppressive functions
    of E-cadherin in breast cancer and other cancer cells.', 'The heavy metal cadmium,
    which is found frequently in shellfish, has been shown to increase the risk of
    breast cancer.', 'Shellfish, particularly oysters and lobster, can also contain
    high levels of copper, which could contribute to angiogenesis and metastasis of
    breast cancer.', 'While individual components of shellfish, such as omega 3 fatty
    acids, have been shown to be preventative against breast cancer, shellfish consumption
    is more likely to increase the risk of breast cancer and other cancers  than to
    be protective.', 'Health risks are derived from a combination of natural toxins
    from algal blooms, infection with pathogenic bacteria, heavy metals and other
    contaminates derived from agricultural and industrial pollution of coastal regions,
    and various unhealthful conditions under which shellfish typically are farmed.',
  'Generally speaking, continuous monitoring of water conditions and shellfish health
    is rare, even in the U.S.', 'When unsafe levels of toxins or other unhealthful
    conditions are suspected, they first must be studied and then, if possible, ameliorated.',
  'This process can take several years, during which time consumers often are not
    aware of any problem.', 'Aquaculture supplies approximately 40% of the worlds
    fish food, including at least 30% of shrimp and most oysters.', 'Leaving aside
    the environmental degradation typical in aquaculture, farmed shellfish usually
    incorporate much higher levels of natural and man-made toxic substances  than
    wild species.', 'Captive shrimp are very susceptible to viral and bacterial infection,
    and farmers use antibiotics and pesticides to deal with this problem.', 'Top non-U.S.
    producers normally use chemicals banned in the U.S. For example, chloramphenicol,
    a potent antibiotic banned in the U.S. in 1986 because of associated adverse health
    effects in humans, is widely used in parts of Asia.', 'Shrimp farm standards imposed
    by the Aquaculture Certification Council, a nonprofit, nongovernmental body established
    to certify safety standards at aquaculture facilities around the world, provides
    an interesting list of banned practices, which, by implication, are commonly used
    overseas.', Some U.S. shrimp farmers have started to use soybean feed instead
    of fish-based feed., 'While this may improve the water quality of the shrimp farm
    and surrounding region, it reduces the level of omega-3 fatty acids in the shrimp.',
  'When researching consumption of shellfish as it relates to cancer risk, we found
    few population studies that assessed this risk, but many studies describing reports
    of shellfish contamination.', 'The following summary list  represents a small
    sample: St. Lawrence maritime estuary, Canada - mussels and clams - cadmium; Central
    California coast - rock crabs - paralytic shellfish toxins from the dinoflagellate
    Alexandrium catenella; Normandy, France - oysters - various pesticides; Moroccan
    Atlantic coast - mussels - untreated chemical wastes from industrial processing
    of phosphates; Bangladesh - dried shrimp - DDT  applied by fishermen and merchants
    to help keep dried shrimp from spoiling; Southwest Louisiana - shrimp, oysters,
    crayfish, crabs - mercury, lead and cadmium from local petrochemical plants; Catalonia,
    Spain - clams, mussels, and shrimp - arsenic, cadmium, mercury, and lead; Malaysian
    coasts and rivers - mollusks and oysters - lead, zinc and cadmium from manufacturing,
    agriculture, sewage and motor vehicle emissions; South Norway - brown crabs and
    mussels - diarrhetic shellfish poisoning from a bloom of the dinoflagellate, Dinophysis
    acuta.', 'For those who want to keep eating shellfish: Of the possible contaminants,
    heavy metals such as cadmium appear to be most directly linked to increased risk
    of breast cancer, followed by some pesticides.', Note that cooking is not effective
    in removing heavy metal from shellfish., 'Avoid shellfish from Louisiana, which
    is known to have high levels of heavy metal contamination.', Shellfish caught
    in the open ocean are not exempt from contamination; excess levels of heavy metals
    have been found in king crabs from the Barents Sea and waters near Australia and
    South America., 'Do not buy shellfish without knowing the country of origin -
    in the case of shrimp, it will likely come from Mexico, Ecuador, Brazil, China,
    India, Thailand, Vietnam, or Bangladesh.', Know your supplier and avoid inexpensive
    restaurant shrimp., 'In August 2008, the FDA advised retail and foodservice operations
    to be aware that raw oysters shipped in containers bearing a For Cooking Only
    label may have a greater likelihood of containing harmful levels of the bacterium
    Vibrio parahaemolyticus.', For Cooking Only labeling had been worked out as a
    compromise to allow the continued sale of oysters when harvesting conditions do
    not meet specific criteria for reduced risk of Vibrio parahaemolyticus contamination.,
  Do not buy oysters with this label., Dried shrimp and salted shrimp paste  imported
    from Asia sometimes incorporate concentrated levels of pesticides., Individuals
    with hepatitis C and others with impaired immunity  should not eat raw shellfish.,
