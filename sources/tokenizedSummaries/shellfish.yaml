text: [One study of Korean 9 to 12 year old girls found that breast development was
    significantly positively associated with consumption of shellfish and processed
    meat., 'Yessotoxin, an algal toxin that can accumulate in edible mollusks, has
    been shown to interfere with the tumor suppressive functions of E-cadherin in
    breast cancer and other cancer cells.', 'The heavy metal cadmium, which is found
    frequently in shellfish, has been shown to increase the risk of breast cancer.',
  'Shellfish, particularly oysters and lobster, can also contain high levels of copper,
    which could contribute to angiogenesis and metastasis of breast cancer.', 'While
    individual components of shellfish, such as omega 3 fatty acids, have been shown
    to be preventative against breast cancer, shellfish consumption is more likely
    to increase the risk of breast cancer and other cancers  than to be protective.',
  'Health risks are derived from a combination of natural toxins from algal blooms,
    infection with pathogenic bacteria, heavy metals and other contaminates derived
    from agricultural and industrial pollution of coastal regions, and various unhealthful
    conditions under which shellfish typically are farmed.', 'Generally speaking,
    continuous monitoring of water conditions and shellfish health is rare, even in
    the U.S.', 'When unsafe levels of toxins or other unhealthful conditions are suspected,
    they first must be studied and then, if possible, ameliorated.', 'This process
    can take several years, during which time consumers often are not aware of any
    problem.']
