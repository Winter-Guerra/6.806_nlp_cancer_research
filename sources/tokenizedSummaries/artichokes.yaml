text: [Artichoke extract has been shown to inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis  in
    triple negative  breast cancer cells in the laboratory., Flavone components of
    artichoke  have been shown to induce apoptosis across a variety of breast cancer
    cell lines., Silibinin has been shown to induce apoptosis in both triple negative
    and hormone receptor positive  breast cancer cells., Silibinin has also been shown
    to reduce the degree of stem cell-like properties of clusters of triple negative
    cells., 'In addition, silibinin has been shown to suppress ER+/PR+ breast cancer
    cell migration.', 'An Italian population study found that the risk of breast cancer
    was reduced for increasing intake of apigenin and luteolin, among other flavones.',
  'However, no population studies have specifically evaluated the impact of consuming
    artichokes on the risk of breast cancer.']
