[Artichoke extract has been shown to inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis (programmed
    cell death) in triple negative (ER-/PR-/HER2-) breast cancer cells in the laboratory.,
  Flavone components of artichoke (apigenin and luteolin) have been shown to induce
    apoptosis across a variety of breast cancer cell lines., Silibinin has been shown
    to induce apoptosis in both triple negative and hormone receptor positive (ER+/PR+)
    breast cancer cells., Silibinin has also been shown to reduce the degree of stem
    cell-like properties of clusters of triple negative cells., 'In addition, silibinin
    has been shown to suppress ER+/PR+ breast cancer cell migration.', 'An Italian
    population study found that the risk of breast cancer was reduced for increasing
    intake of apigenin and luteolin, among other flavones.', 'However, no population
    studies have specifically evaluated the impact of consuming artichokes on the
    risk of breast cancer.']
