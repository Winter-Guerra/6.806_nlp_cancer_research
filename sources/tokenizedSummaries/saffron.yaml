text: [Saffron has been shown to have dose-dependent inhibitory effects on the proliferation
    of hormone receptor positive  and triple negative  breast cancer cells., Saffron
    has also been shown to reduce angiogenesis  in ER+/PR+ breast cancer cells., 'Saffron
    has been found to greatly inhibit cellular DNA damage, including Adriamycin-induced
    heart damage.', 'However, we do not recommend it during Adriamycin-based chemotherapy
    since it might also protect cancer cells from the treatment.', One study reported
    that concurrent use of cyclophosphamide and saffron extract reduced toxic effect
    of cyclophosphamide and caused estrogen to be produced., Another study reported
    that pre-treatment with saffron significantly inhibited cellular DNA damage caused
    by cisplatin., 'On the other hand, extracts of saffron have been shown to considerably
    increase the cytotoxicity in breast cancer cells induced by Taxol.', 'Based on
    the available evidence, saffron should be limited or avoided during chemotherapy.',
  Saffrons radioprotective properties indicate that it should not be used during radiation
    treatment., There is some evidence that saffron could be toxic at very high doses
    and we recommend consuming saffron as a spice and not taking saffron tablets.]
