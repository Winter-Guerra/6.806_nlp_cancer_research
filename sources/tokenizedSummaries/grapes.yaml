text: ['Red grapes and grape seeds are a good source of resveratrol, which has the
    ability to suppress proliferation of breast cancer cells and promote cell death.',
  'Resveratrol also can inhibit aromatase, which is important for reducing growth-stimulatory
    effects in estrogen-dependent breast cancer.', Other grape polyphenols such as
    quercetin and catechin have also been shown to have chemopreventive effects and
    appear to act synergistically with resveratrol in inhibiting breast cancer growth.,
  Several population studies have reported that grape consumption is associated with
    reduced risk of breast cancer., Resveratrol has also been shown to increase the
    effects of radiation treatment and the chemotherapy drug Taxol  against breast
    cancer.]
