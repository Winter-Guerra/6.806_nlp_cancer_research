['Like other fatty fish, salmon contains the marine fatty acids docosahexaenoic acid
    (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), which have chemopreventive properties.',
  These marine fatty acids have been shown to inhibit proliferation of breast cancer
    cells in the laboratory., Relatively high fatty fish intake has been shown to
    be associated with reduced risk of breast cancer and improved survival., 'In one
    experiment, higher omega-3 to omega-6 fatty acid diets reduced mammary gland density
    in mice, which in turn reduced carcinogen-induced mammary tumor development.',
  Fish oil has been shown to inhibit early stages of mammary tumor development in
    a mouse model of HER-2/neu overexpressing (HER2+) breast cancer., DHA has been
    demonstrated to reduce bone metastasis in a mouse model of breast cancer., 'Another
    study found that docosahexaenoic acid increased survial times for almost half
    of a group of stage IV breast cancer patients on FEC (5-FU, epirubicin and cyclophosphamide)
    chemotherapy.', Fish protein hydrolysates also have been shown to have antiproliferative
    activity against human breast cancer cell lines in vitro., 'Many epidemiological
    studies have found convincing evidence of a negative association between DHA and
    EPA intake or fatty fish consumption and the risk of breast cancer, although not
    all are in agreement.', 'In addition, several studies have found that higher omega-3
    to omega-6 fatty acid intakes are associated with reduced risk of breast cancer;
    consuming wild salmon would tend to improve this ratio for most women.']
