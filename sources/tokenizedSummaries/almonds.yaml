    not the bitter almond nut (Prunus amygdalus amara).', 'Almonds are a good dietary
    source of vitamin E, magnesium, copper, chromium, manganese, phosphorus, riboflavin
    and melatonin, as well as soluble fiber and monounsaturated fats.', 'Almonds contain
    numerous phytochemicals, including quercetin, quercitrin, isorhamnetin, naringenin,
    catechin, epicatechin, and morin.', Almond components have been shown to have
    high antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties., 'Consumption of almonds has
    been shown in numerous studies to help lower cholesterol, reduce blood sugar,
