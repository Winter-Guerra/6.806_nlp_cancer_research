text: [A number of studies have found that olive oil consumption  is associated with
    a lower risk of breast cancer., 'For example, a prospective Swedish study found
    a lower risk of breast cancer for women after 50 with a high intake of monounsaturated
    fat compared to consumption of other types of fat.', A study of women in the Canary
    Islands found a lower risk of breast cancer for women in the highest quintile
    of monounsaturated fat consumption and even lower for those consuming mostly olive
    oil., Italian and Greek studies have also found that olive oil consumption is
    associated with a lower risk of breast cancer., A 2011 meta-analysis of data from
    19 previous case-control studies found that the highest level of olive oil consumption
    was associated with approximately half the risk of developing breast cancer compared
    with the lowest intake level of intake., 'On the other hand, a large 2012 prospective
    study among women in Spain, Italy and Greece reported that women in the highest
    third of olive oil consumption had essentially the same risk of breast cancer
    as those in the lowest third.', Numerous studies have found that extra virgin
    olive oil inhibits proliferation of and induces apoptosis of HER2/neu overexpressing  breast
    cancer cells., These effects appear to be due to olive lignans and secoiridoids
    rather than olive phenols and phenolic acids., 'In fact, some observers have concluded
    that the protective effect of olive oil against breast cancer is mostly confined
    to the HER2+ breast cancer subtype, with no significant influence on the occurrence
    of HER2- disease.', Consumption of olive oil reduces the aggressiveness of mammary
    tumors in animal models of breast cancer., One study compared induced tumors in
    rats that were fed high-fat diets  either olive oil or corn oil., 'The high corn
    oil diet clearly stimulated cancer development, resulting in the earliest appearance
    of tumors and the highest tumor incidence and yield, whereas the high extra-virgin
    olive oil diet appeared to have only a weak enhancing effect, primarily by increasing
    tumor yield compared to control animals fed a low-fat diet.', 'Laboratory studies
    have documented specific olive oil-induced molecular changes in cancer cells and
    tumors, including changes in the composition of cell membranes, signaling proteins
    and gene expression.', 'These changes are likely to result in lower proliferation
    and more apoptosis  of breast cancer cells, as well as enhanced protection against
    DNA damage.', Extra-virgin olive oil potentiates the effects of aromatase inhibitors
    in ER+/PR+ breast cancer cells by increasing programmed cell death., Oleic acid
    has been shown to increase the effect of the chemotherapy drug Taxol  against
    breast cancer., Olive oil has also been shown to increase Herceptins effectiveness
    in treating HER2+ breast cancer and may counteract resistance to Herceptin.]
