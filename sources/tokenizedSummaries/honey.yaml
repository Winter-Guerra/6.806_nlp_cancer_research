['Honey has been found to have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimutagenic, antimicrobial,
    antiatherogenic, and antithrombotic effects, as well as wound healing properties.',
  'Honey is composed primarily of the sugars levulose, dextrose, and maltose, with
    a small fraction of sucrose, whereas table sugar consists of sucrose.', 'Honey
    also contains chrysin, galangin, pinobanksin, pinostrobin, pinocembrin, acacetin,
    caffeic acid, caffeic acid phenyl esters, quercetin, kaempferol, and apigenin,
    all of which have known or suspected anticancer activities.', 'In addition to
    its beneficial flavonol content, honey consumption has been shown to have slower
    uptake into the bloodstream (making it less likely to cause an overstimulation
    of insulin production) than sugar, and to result in lower blood glucose and triglyceride
    levels than sugar consumption, all of which may mean that using honey as a sweetener
    instead of table sugar could be beneficial to overall health.']
