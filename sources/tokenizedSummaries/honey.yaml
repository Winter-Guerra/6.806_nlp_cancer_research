text: ['Honey has been found to have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimutagenic,
    antimicrobial, antiatherogenic, and antithrombotic effects, as well as wound healing
    properties.', 'Honey is composed primarily of the sugars levulose, dextrose, and
    maltose, with a small fraction of sucrose, whereas table sugar consists of sucrose.',
  'Honey also contains chrysin, galangin, pinobanksin, pinostrobin, pinocembrin, acacetin,
    caffeic acid, caffeic acid phenyl esters, quercetin, kaempferol, and apigenin,
    all of which have known or suspected anticancer activities.', 'In addition to
    its beneficial flavonol content, honey consumption has been shown to have slower
    uptake into the bloodstream  than sugar, and to result in lower blood glucose
    and triglyceride levels than sugar consumption, all of which may mean that using
    honey as a sweetener instead of table sugar could be beneficial to overall health.']
