text: ['Benzyl isothiocyanate, found in papaya flesh and seeds, has been shown to
    selectively induce apoptosis in human breast cancer cells.', The high carotenoid
    levels found in papayas suggest that consuming the fruit could serve to protect
    against breast cancer., 'However, no population studies have been performed that
    directly assess the effects of papaya on the risk of breast cancer.']
