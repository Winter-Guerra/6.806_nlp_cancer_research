['The interest in escargot snails derives in part from its unique lectin, Helix pomatia
    agglutinin (HPA), that is used as a prognostic indicator for some cancers, including
    breast cancer.', 'Lectins, a group of glycoproteins found in animal as well as
    plant cells, are used as differentiating markers to study cancers and metastatic
    cell lines.', Changes in glycosylation of cell membranes play an important role
    in the metastatic behavior of tumor cells., Carbohydrate residues of the membrane
    glycoproteins can be detected using certain lectins due to the fact that the lectins
    bind specifically to these carbohydrates., "HPA recognizes \u03B1-D-N-acetylgalactosamine-containing\
    \ epitopes (parts of macromolecules recognized by the immune system) which are\
    \ only present in cancer cell lines having a high likelihood to undergo metastasis.",
  HPA fixation on histological preparations of breast cancer tissues is associated
    with an ominous prognosis., A 2015 study reported that HPA itself has the potential
    to promote breast cancer metastasis through increased vascular invasion and lymph
    node involvement., A different lectin from the giant African land snail (Achatina
    fulica) has been found to cause apoptosis (programmed cell death) in human breast
    cancer cells., 'However, evidence concerning the giant African land snail and
    the fact that a component of escargot snails binds specifically to aggressive
    breast cancer cells does not mean that consuming escargot will help prevent breast
    cancer.', No population studies have been performed to test the hypothesis that
    consuming escargot is associated with reduced breast cancer risk.]
