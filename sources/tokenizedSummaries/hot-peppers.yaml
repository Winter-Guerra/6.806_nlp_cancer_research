text: ['Capsaicin has been shown to inhibit growth and induce apoptosis in breast
    cancer cells, including HER2/Neu overexpressing  and epidermal growth factor receptor
    -overexpressing breast cancer.', Several population studies have found an association
    between hot pepper consumption and lower incidence of breast cancer., There is
    some evidence that breast cancer survivors are at increased risk of developing
    stomach cancer., Lobular breast cancer survivors in particular are vulnerable
    to gastric metastases., 'Women with lobular breast cancer and those with gallstones,
    as well as pregnant women, should moderate their hot pepper consumption.', 'On
    the other hand, hot pepper consumption may be beneficial for other women with
    breast cancer or those at risk.', By this we mean modest amounts up to several
    times per week., 'Large or frequent meals that have been made very hot by the
    incorporation of one or more forms of hot peppers are to be avoided, as are capsaicin
    supplements.']
