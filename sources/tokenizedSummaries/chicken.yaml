text: ['Chicken and poultry consumption have been found in numerous studies to be
    associated with lower risk of breast cancer, although not all published research
    is consistent on this point.', 'Consumption of white meat was associated with
    lower breast density, a strong breast cancer risk factor, in one study.', Another
    large prospective study reported that adolescent poultry intake was associated
    with lower risk of breast cancer in adulthood., The associations might be a result
    of food substitution  eating chicken rather than red meat reduces the proportion
    of red meat in the diet., 'For those who eat meat, organic chicken is a much better
    choice than beef, pork or processed meat.', 'The method of preparation appears
    to be important; very well done barbecued chicken, deep fried chicken, grilled
    well done chicken with skin, and pan-fried chicken all have been found to contain
    unacceptably high levels of heterocyclic amines  and benzopyrene, which are known
    carcinogens.', Chicken gravy made with pan drippings is also not recommended.,
  Population studies that examined cooking methods have found consumption of deep
    fried chicken and chicken with skin to be associated with increased breast cancer
    risk., 'Based on the available evidence, organic skinless chicken that has not
    been charred or cooked using a high-heat method may offer some protection against
    breast cancer or at least not increase risk.']
