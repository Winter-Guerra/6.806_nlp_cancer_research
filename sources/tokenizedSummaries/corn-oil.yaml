text: [Numerous studies have shown that a diet high in corn oil stimulates the formation
    of breast tumors in laboratory rats., Several experiments also have shown that
    offspring of rat mothers fed high corn oil diets are more likely to develop mammary
    tumors than offspring of mothers fed canola oil diets., The explanations given
    for these findings are related to corn oils relatively high level of omega-6 fatty
    acids., One study reported that women with a specific genotype  who consumed a
    significant amount of linoleic acid in their diets had an increased risk of breast
    cancer., Another study found increased breast cancer risk among women cooking
    primarily with high linoleic acid vegetable or corn oil compared to women using
    olive or canola oil., Women with breast cancer have been found to have higher
    levels of omega-6 in their breast tissue than similar women without breast cancer.,
  Several studies have found that lower dietary omega-6/omega-3 ratios are associated
    with reduced risk of breast cancer., Consuming corn oil would tend to increase
    the ratio for most women because of its high omega-6 content.]
