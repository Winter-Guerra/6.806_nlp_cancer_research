text: [There are a number of varieties of dry beans  consumed in the United States
    and their chemopreventative potential varies greatly., 'For the purposes of this
    website, dry beans are defined as black beans, kidney beans, navy beans, pinto
    beans, pink beans, red beans and white beans.', 'The following beans are specifically
    excluded from the dry bean category: adzuki beans, black-eyed peas, chickpeas,
    fava beans, lentils, lima beans, and mung beans.', Dry beans have been shown to
    contain potent antioxidant and antiproliferative components., One study found
    six flavonoids in the coats of black beans with potent antiproliferative activities
    against hormone receptor positive  breast cancer cells., Another study found that
    tanins isolated from black beans inhibited angiogenesis., Several studies have
    found that dry bean consumption reduces mammary tumor incidence and number in
    rats., One study that examined the cellular processes by which tumor burden was
    reduced reported that the dominant process was induction of apoptosis., Circuling
    insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1  were also reduced., 'A study of the
    diets of 90,630 women in the Nurses Health Study II found a significant inverse
    relationship between breast cancer and the intake of beans.', Another study found
    that higher intake of dry beans improved survival among postmenopausal women with
    breast cancer., The authors attributed this survival advantage to the lignan content
    of beans., A number of studies have shown that dry beans are antiproliferative
    and proapoptic versus colon cancer cells and that this effect appears to be due
    to both soluble and insoluble components of the beans., Below are links to recent
    studies concerning this food., 'For a more complete list, including less recent
