['Components of greens have been found to down-regulate hormone receptor expression,
    promote apoptosis, suppress cell cycle progression and inhibit angiogenesis of
    human breast cancer cells.', 'Consumption of brassica vegetables has been shown
    to reduce the estrogen metabolite 16alpha-hydroxyestrone, which is a breast cancer
    promoter, and to be marginally inversely associated with breast cancer risk in
    population studies.', A Korean study found an association between kale consumption
    and lower incidence of breast cancer (kale is closely related to greens)., Greens
    components quercetin and I3C have been shown increase the anti-cancer effects
    of the chemotherapy drug Taxol (paclitaxel).]
