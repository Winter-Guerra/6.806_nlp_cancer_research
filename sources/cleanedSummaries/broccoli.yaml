  Broccoli contains numerous substances with suspected or demonstrated cancer fighting
  properties, including sulforaphane, quercetin, sinigrin, enterolactone, kaempferol
  glycosides, beta-carotene, indole-3-carbinol, 3,3-diindolylmethane, and several
  other glucosinolates. Broccoli has been found to promote apoptosis, suppress cell
  cycle progression and inhibit angiogenesis of human breast cancer cells. Consumption
  of broccoli has been shown to reduce the estrogen metabolite 16alpha-hydroxyestrone,
  which is a breast cancer promoter, and to be marginally inversely associated with
  breast cancer risk in a population of premenopausal women. Broccoli components quercetin,
  I3C and sulforaphane have all been shown increase the anti-cancer effects of the
  chemotherapy drug Taxol. Broccoli sprouts are particularly rich in anticancer nutrients.
