  Although not all studies of the relationship between breast cancer and dairy foods
  have found a positive association between butter intake and the risk of breast cancer,
  many have. Women in the Nurses Health Study who consumed more butter during high
  school have been found to have a higher risk of breast cancer in adulthood. Another
  study found that butter consumption was associated with increased risk of recurrence
  of early stage breast cancer, especially among premenopausal breast cancer cases.
  Other U.S, Canadian and European studies have found the use of butter in soups or
  sauces, butter at the dinner table, and butter used for frying food to be associated
  with higher risk of breast cancer. High intake of animal fats has been linked in
  several studies to increased breast density, a risk factor for breast cancer and
  recurrence.
