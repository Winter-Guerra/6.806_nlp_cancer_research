Kefir has been shown to have antiproliferative activity against hormone receptor positive (ER+/PR+) human breast cancer cells and this anticancer effect was observed at much lower concentrations than similar effects of yogurt. Several studies have demonstrated that milk fermented with L. helveticus decreased the growth rate of mammary tumors in experimental rats and that this involved decreased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, which is implicated in estrogen synthesis. Kefir is also a good source of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), which has been shown to inhibit the growth and migration of breast cancer cells.

A Swedish study of the relationship between various fats in the diet and risk of breast cancer for women aged at least 50 found that fat from fermented milk products was negatively associated with breast cancer risk.
