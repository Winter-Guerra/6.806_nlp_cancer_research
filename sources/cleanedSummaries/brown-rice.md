Phytic acid (found in rice bran) has been shown to induce marked growth inhibition in breast cancer cells without harming normal cells. Purple rice bran extract reduced vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced angiogenesis by inhibiting proliferation and migration in one cell study. A study that examined the anti-cancer activity of eight brown rice phenols (protocatechuic acid, p-coumaric acid, caffeic acid, ferulic acid, sinapic acid, vanillic acid, methoxycinnamic acid, and tricin) found that caffeic acid, ferulic acid, and tricin each were effective in reducing the colony-forming ability of triple negative breast cancer cells.

An anthocyanin-rich extract from black rice reduced the viability of several breast cancer cell lines in another study. The same study found that the extract significantly suppressed tumor growth and angiogenesis in mice implanted with HER2/neu overexpressing (HER2+) tumors. Brown rice has been shown to inhibit the growth and proliferation of mouse mammary tumors. One study reported that a compound found in rice bran sensitized metastatic hormone receptor positive breast cancer cells to Taxol (paclitaxel).
