  Although salt is a necessity, U.S. consumers are unlikely ever to be deficient in
  salt. Our diets are heavily loaded with salt, the majority of which is derived from
  processed food, fast food, and restaurant meals. Increasing salt consumption is
  correlated with higher blood pressure in the majority of people, so that high salt
  consumption serves to promote heart disease and stroke. Salt consumption is also
  suspected of contributing to insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome, which themselves
  may be associated with increased risk of breast cancer. High salt consumption has
  been found to be associated with increased risk of pancreatic cancer. Consumption
  of highly salted foods  has also been found to be associated with increased risks
  of ovarian and prostate cancer in China. Consumption of salted fish has been shown
  in several studies to increase the risks of nasopharyngeal and colorectal cancers,
  as well as stomach cancer. One South American study found the risk of esophageal
  cancer to increase with increasing consumption of salt.


  The relationship between salt and cancer is related to two types of salt intake:
  high overall intake and high intake of very salty foods. The relatively high overall
  level of salt in the average U.S. diet contributes to cancer risk indirectly by
  promoting metabolic syndrome and reducing the potassium/sodium ratio in the diet,
  both of which are thought to increase the risks of various cancers.


  The second type of cancer-promoting salt intake occurs when people consume highly
  salted specialty foods, condiments and snacks. These foods act directly on the digestive
  track and have been shown in numerous studies to cause stomach  cancer. Implicated
  foods include dried and salted fish and seafood, fermented/pickled vegetables, fish
  sauce, kimchi, salted preserved vegetables, salted and fermented soybean paste,
  salted fish preserves, salted fish roe, salted meat, salted shrimp paste, salty
  snacks, and salty soups. Many of the foods listed above are Asian; since the rate
  of stomach cancer is relatively high in Asia, there has been great interest in investigating
  the causes. Note however, that European and South American studies also have found
  associations between heavily salted foods and stomach cancer.


  There is some evidence that breast cancer survivors are at increased risk of developing
  stomach cancer and lobular breast cancer survivors in particular are vulnerable
  to gastric metastases.


  Sodium nitrite and related compounds are routinely added to processed meat and some
  other salty foods to preserve their freshness and coloring. Sodium nitrite has been
  shown to react with chemicals in the stomach to produce nitrosamines, which are
  known to be cancer-promoting. However, the cancer-related effects of salt consumption
  are not dependent on the presence of sodium nitrite; this carcinogen simply worsens
  the cancer profile of salty foods that contain it.


  Iodine deficiency is a major cause of preventable mental retardation found worldwide.
  Iodized salt is designed to prevent this deficiency.


  Note that while we are continually searching for new evidence specifically concerning
  this food, there is not much interest in it among breast cancer researchers, so
  few studies are available.
