  the influence of lamb consumption on breast cancer risk and some groups of people
  seldom eat lamb. The following studies specifically included lamb, either as part
  of red meat consumption, or separately:\n\n   A prospective study that was designed
  to investigate the relationship between post-diagnosis diet and survival after breast
  cancer reported that women in the highest compared to the lowest fifth of intake
  of saturated fat intake had a significantly higher risk of dying from any cause.
  Saturated fats are found primarily in meats and dairy foods  and baked and fried
  foods containing palm oil, palm kernel oil or coconut oil. Results were similar
  for risk of dying specifically from breast cancer, however they did not reach statistical
  significance.\n   A Chinese retrospective case-control study designed to investigate
  the relationship between dietary patterns and risk of breast cancer found that a
  diet characterized by high consumption of vegetables, fruit, soy, milk, poultry,
  and fish and low consumption of refined grains, red meat, and pickles was associated
  with reduced risk of breast cancer.\n   A Uruguayan study which analyzed 39 food
  groups to determine association with ductal breast cancer reported that a dietary
  pattern that included lamb was associated with increased breast cancer risk.\n   A
  study that included 52,158 postmenopausal women reported that, comparing the fifth
  to the first quintile, red meat, the heterocyclic amine  2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazoquinoxaline,
  and dietary iron each were associated with increased risk of breast cancer.\n   Higher
  red meat consumption during adolescence by women in the Nurses Health Study II has
  been found to be associated with increased risk of premenopausal breast cancer in
  adulthood.\n   A UK study found that both pre- and postmenopausal women who consumed
  the most meat  had the highest risk of breast cancer.\n\nA number of factors may
  account for the findings of increased breast cancer risk:\n\n   The U.S. lamb industry
  uses zeranol, a non-steroidal substance with estrogenic activity, as a growth promoter.
  Zeranol has been found to stimulate human breast cancer cell growth and proliferation.
  Other growth promoters  that are routinely administered to lamb are also suspected
  to contribute to breast cancer risk.\n   Irradiation of lamb, which is widespread
  in the U.S., has been found to result in the formation of alkylcyclobutanones, which
  have been shown to have mutagenic and tumor promoting activities.\n   Some of the
  HCAs formed in very well done lamb and in lamb drippings are known human carcinogens
  that have been shown to have potent estrogenic activity, inducing activation of
  estrogen-regulated genes, proliferation of estrogen-dependent cells and up-regulation
  of progesterone receptor.\n\nHowever, note that not all studies have found an association
  between red meat consumption and breast cancer risk.\n\n"
