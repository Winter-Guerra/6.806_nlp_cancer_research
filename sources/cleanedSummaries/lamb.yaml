text: "\n\nLamb is a good dietary source of protein, zinc, selenium, B-vitamins and
  iron. Lamb also contains high levels of conjugated linoleic acid  and stearate,
  both of which have been shown to induce breast cancer cell death. However, the potentially
  favorable effects of these components appear to be overwhelmed by lambs high level
  of saturated fat and the carcinogenic effects of naturally-occurring lamb compounds,
  lamb additives and lamb preparation methods. Diets high in red meat or well-done
  red meat have been linked in various population studies to higher risks of non-Hodgkins
  lymphoma and cancers of the oral cavity, throat, esophagus, lung, stomach, pancreas,
  liver, colon, rectum, endometrium and prostate.\n\nMost population studies combine
  lamb with other red meat intake when evaluating the influence of lamb consumption
  on breast cancer risk and some groups of people seldom eat lamb. The following studies
  specifically included lamb, either as part of red meat consumption, or separately:\n\n
  \  A prospective study that was designed to investigate the relationship between
  post-diagnosis diet and survival after breast cancer reported that women in the
  highest compared to the lowest fifth of intake of saturated fat intake had a significantly
  higher risk of dying from any cause. Saturated fats are found primarily in meats
  and dairy foods  and baked and fried foods containing palm oil, palm kernel oil
  or coconut oil. Results were similar for risk of dying specifically from breast
  cancer, however they did not reach statistical significance.\n   A Chinese retrospective
  case-control study designed to investigate the relationship between dietary patterns
  and risk of breast cancer found that a diet characterized by high consumption of
  vegetables, fruit, soy, milk, poultry, and fish and low consumption of refined grains,
  red meat, and pickles was associated with reduced risk of breast cancer.\n   A Uruguayan
  study which analyzed 39 food groups to determine association with ductal breast
  cancer reported that a dietary pattern that included lamb was associated with increased
  breast cancer risk.\n   A study that included 52,158 postmenopausal women reported
  that, comparing the fifth to the first quintile, red meat, the heterocyclic amine
  \ 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazoquinoxaline, and dietary iron each were associated
  with increased risk of breast cancer.\n   Higher red meat consumption during adolescence
  by women in the Nurses Health Study II has been found to be associated with increased
  risk of premenopausal breast cancer in adulthood.\n   A UK study found that both
  pre- and postmenopausal women who consumed the most meat  had the highest risk of
  breast cancer.\n\nA number of factors may account for the findings of increased
  breast cancer risk:\n\n   The U.S. lamb industry uses zeranol, a non-steroidal substance
  with estrogenic activity, as a growth promoter. Zeranol has been found to stimulate
  human breast cancer cell growth and proliferation. Other growth promoters  that
  are routinely administered to lamb are also suspected to contribute to breast cancer
  risk.\n   Irradiation of lamb, which is widespread in the U.S., has been found to
  result in the formation of alkylcyclobutanones, which have been shown to have mutagenic
  and tumor promoting activities.\n   Some of the HCAs formed in very well done lamb
  and in lamb drippings are known human carcinogens that have been shown to have potent
  estrogenic activity, inducing activation of estrogen-regulated genes, proliferation
  of estrogen-dependent cells and up-regulation of progesterone receptor.\n\nHowever,
  note that not all studies have found an association between red meat consumption
  and breast cancer risk.\n\nMost U.S. consumers never eat mutton, which has a strong
  flavor compared to lamb. The majority of lambs consumed in the U.S. are grown in
  Texas, California, Wyoming, Colorado or South Dakota and processed in Colorado,
  Iowa, Michigan or New Jersey. Lambs are normally finished  in feedlots. Colorado
  produces the most organic lambs and sheep. However, over 40 percent of U.S. lamb
  and mutton is imported from Australia and New Zealand.\n\nIf lamb is to be consumed,
  it makes sense to buy grass-fed organic lamb to avoid eating irradiated, growth
  hormone-treated meat from soy- or corn-fed animals. Grass-fed lamb has a more favorable
  fatty acid content, with a higher proportion of omega-3 fatty acids. Note that the
  organic label does not necessarily mean free range or grass fed. The primary requirements
  for lamb to be labeled organic is that the animals are raised without the use of
  antibiotics and growth hormones and that their feed  must be organically grown.
  Although most New Zealand land is grass-fed, lamb grown for export to the U.S. may
  be corn fed.\n\nWell done and flame-broiled lamb is not recommended. Fat drippings
  and grill residue scrapings contain particularly high levels of HCAs and should
  be discarded.\n\nAlthough we do not recommend supplementation with CLA, we wish
  to advise those who do to avoid the t10,c12-CLA isomer. The t10,c12 CLA isomer was
  found to dramatically enhance mammary tumor development in one mouse experiment.
  The time by which 50% of the mice in the group developed a tumor was shortened from
  267 days for mice on a control diet to 169 days for mice fed t10,c12-CLA. Choose
  products with only the c9,t11 isomer.\n\nBelow are links to recent studies concerning
