The black pepper compounds piperine and β-caryophyllene oxide have been shown to reduce breast cancer cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and metastasis in the laboratory. β-caryophyllene oxide interferes with multiple signaling cascades involved in tumorigenesis. Piperine reduces the growth of breast cancer cells without affecting the growth of normal breast cells. Piperine has been shown to inhibit the growth and motility of triple negative breast cancer cells.

Piperine has been shown to enhance breast stem cell sensitivity to curcumin, a component of the spice turmeric. Curcumin may decrease breast cancer risk in part by reducing breast stem cell self-renewal and enhancing differentiation of breast stem cells.

Piperine may enhance the effectiveness of Adriamycin (doxorubicin), Taxol (paclitaxel) and 5-FU chemotherapy.
