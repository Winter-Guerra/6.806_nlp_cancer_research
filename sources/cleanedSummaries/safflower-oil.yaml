  Safflower oil has the highest proportion of linoleic acid of all common cooking
  oils. In addition to cancer cell studies, numerous experiments using either carcinogen-induced
  tumors or transplanted mammary tumors in mice have demonstrated that linoleic acid
  promotes mammary tumor development. Daughter mice of female mice fed a high linoleic
  diet are more prone to develop mammary tumors.


  One study reported that women with a specific genotype  who consumed a significant
  amount of linoleic acid in their diets had an increased risk of breast cancer. Another
  study found increased breast cancer risk among women cooking primarily with high
  linoleic acid vegetable or corn oil compared to women using olive or canola oil.


  Women with breast cancer have been found to have higher levels of omega-6 in their
  breast tissue than similar women without breast cancer. Several studies have found
  that lower dietary omega-6/omega-3 ratios are associated with reduced risk of breast
  cancer. Consuming safflower oil would tend to increase the ratio for most women
  because of its high omega-6 content.
