Brussels sprouts contain numerous substances with suspected or demonstrated cancer fighting properties, including beta-carotene, sulforaphane, indole-3-carbinol (I3C), 3,3'-diindolylmethane (DIM), and several other glucosinolates. Brussels sprouts are also a good source of the lignan enterolactone. Brussels sprouts have been found to be promote apoptosis, suppress cell cycle progression and inhibit angiogenesis of human breast cancer cells. Futhermore, brussels sprouts can protect against cell DNA damage. Consumption of brassica vegetables has been shown to reduce the estrogen metabolite 16alpha-hydroxyestrone, which is a breast cancer promoter, and to be marginally inversely associated with breast cancer risk in a population of premenopausal women. Brussels sprouts components I3C and sulforaphane have both been shown increase the anti-cancer effects of the chemotherapy drug Taxol (paclitaxel). The kaempferol in brussels sprouts might help protect against the cardiotoxicity of Adriamycin chemotherapy.
