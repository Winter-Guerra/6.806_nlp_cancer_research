  Components of cheese, including calcium, vitamin D, stearate, and CLA have been
  found to induce apoptosis of breast cancer cells or reduce mammary tumor size and
  incidence in the laboratory. However, many  population studies have found that cheese
  consumption is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. The factors that
  may contribute to this increased risk include the fact that much of the milk we
  drink today is produced from pregnant cows, as well as the presence of saturated
  fat, recombinant bovine growth hormone, and various environmental contaminants in
  cheese. High intake of animal fats has been linked in several studies to increased
  breast density, a risk factor for breast cancer and recurrence. On the other hand,
  like fermented milk products, consumption of low-fat or non-fat cheese may be protective
  against breast cancer.


  CLA has been found to inhibit breast cancer in the laboratory at concentrations
  close to human consumption levels. Several population studies have been performed
  specifically to evaluate the possible association between consumption of CLA in
  cheese and other dairy products and the risk of breast cancer. The study results
  have been contradictory. A large prospective Netherlands population study found
  a weak positive association between CLA intake and the risk breast cancer  and concluded
  that the apparent anticarcinogenic properties of CLA in animal and tissue culture
  models had not been confirmed in humans. However, an earlier Finnish study of women
  who already had breast cancer found that dietary CLA and levels of CLA in the blood
  were significantly lower in the postmenopausal breast cancer cases than in the postmenopausal
  controls without cancer.


  Recombinant bovine growth hormone, which is administered to cows to increase milk
  production, has been suggested to increase breast cancer risk. The hormone itself
  is thought to be biologically inactive in humans. However, it causes the cow liver
  to produce insulin-like growth factor 1, which enters the blood and milk as well.
  The bovine form of IGF-1 is identical to the human form. IGF-1 is required for mammary
  development at puberty and has been implicated in increased risk of breast cancer.
  Several studies have found a modest positive association between circulating IGF-I
  levels and breast cancer risk among premenopausal women. In fact, substances that
  inhibit IGF-I action in the mammary gland are being developed in the hope that they
  can eventually play a role in breast cancer chemoprevention.
