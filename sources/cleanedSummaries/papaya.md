Benzyl isothiocyanate, found in papaya flesh and seeds, has been shown to selectively induce apoptosis in human breast cancer cells. The high carotenoid levels found in papayas suggest that consuming the fruit could serve to protect against breast cancer. However, no population studies have been performed that directly assess the effects of papaya on the risk of breast cancer.
