Saffron has been shown to have dose-dependent inhibitory effects on the proliferation of hormone receptor positive (ER+/PR+) and triple negative (ER-/PR-/HER2-) breast cancer cells. Saffron has also been shown to reduce angiogenesis (new blood vessel formation) in ER+/PR+ breast cancer cells.

Saffron has been found to greatly inhibit cellular DNA damage, including Adriamycin-induced heart damage. However, we do not recommend it during Adriamycin-based chemotherapy since it might also protect cancer cells from the treatment. One study reported that concurrent use of cyclophosphamide and saffron extract reduced toxic effect of cyclophosphamide and caused estrogen to be produced. Another study reported that pre-treatment with saffron significantly inhibited cellular DNA damage caused by cisplatin. On the other hand, extracts of saffron have been shown to considerably increase the cytotoxicity in breast cancer cells induced by Taxol (paclitaxel). Based on the available evidence, saffron should be limited or avoided during chemotherapy.

Saffron's radioprotective properties indicate that it should not be used during radiation treatment.

There is some evidence that saffron could be toxic at very high doses and we recommend consuming saffron as a spice and not taking saffron tablets.
