  Soybean paste is a type of fermented bean paste widely used in Asian cuisine. Soybean
  paste normally is salty and may also be spicy. The soybeans may be roasted or aged
  before being ground to make the paste and various other ingredients such as wheat
  flour, sugar or hot pepper paste may be incorporated into the paste. The conditions
  of fermentation and microflora used in production also affect the flavor. Soybean
  paste is used as a condiment to flavor dishes such as stir-fries and soups. Miso
  is a fermented soybean paste widely used in Japan as a soup base or for seasoning.
  This web page focuses on soybean paste; tofu, soybean oil, soy protein isolate and
  soybeans are covered in separate web pages. We attempt to untangle the conflicting
  findings regarding breast cancer risk and soybean isoflavones in the genistein and
  daidzein web page.
