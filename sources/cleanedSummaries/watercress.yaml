  Various isothiocyanates derived from watercress have been found to have chemopreventive
  activity against a variety of breast cancer cell lines in the laboratory and in
  epidemiologic studies. A Chinese study which measured urinary isothiocyanate levels
  as a marker of brassica vegetable intake found that higher levels were protective
  against breast cancer in both premenopausal and postmenopausal women.


  Watercress is the most abundant dietary source of PEITC, which has been found to
  reduce the growth of human breast cancer cells, decrease angiogenesis, inhibit the
  growth of HER2 overexpressing  mammary tumors in mice, and inhibit metastasis to
  the brain in a mouse model of breast cancer.
