  By lettuce, we mean iceberg, romaine, red leaf, or butterhead  lettuce. Not included
  in the lettuce category is arugula, which is a cruciferous vegetable. Lettuce is
  a dietary source of vitamin A, vitamin K, vitamin C, folate and manganese. Generally
  speaking, romaine lettuce is far more nutritious than iceberg lettuce, with higher
  levels of all of these vitamins and minerals. Bibb lettuce and red leaf lettuce
  fall in between. Lettuce also contains the flavonoids quercetin and luteolin, both
  of which have been shown to be protective against breast cancer. Lettuce has been
  shown to have antioxidant properties  and to improve cholesterol profile. Lettuce
  consumption has been found to be associated with lower risks of lung, gastric, bladder
  and colorectal cancer.


  A Japanese study found that frequent lettuce consumption was associated with lower
  risk of breast cancer. One Mexican study found that consumption of lettuce was associated
  with lower risk of breast cancer in premenopausal women. A Greek study found that
  women with breast cancer consumed significantly less lettuce than those without
  breast cancer.


  Non-organic lettuce must be washed very thoroughly to remove pesticide residue as
  much as possible. Outbreaks of E. coli, salmonella, and shigellosis infections linked
  to lettuce occur from time to time. Consumers should stay aware of and act upon
  any such reports.
