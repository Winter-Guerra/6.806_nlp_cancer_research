  Many studies have been conducted to try to determine the effects of milk consumption
  on the risk of breast cancer and on breast cancer development, but the results appear
  contradictory, presumably because milk has both beneficial and harmful components.


  Components of milk, including calcium, vitamin D, stearate, lactaptin, conjugated
  linoleic acid, and bovine lactoferricin, have been found to induce apoptosis of
  breast cancer cells or reduce mammary tumor size and incidence in the laboratory.
  In fact, milk has been found to be somewhat protective against breast cancer when
  consumed in infancy and childhood.


  Some population-based studies have found that milk consumption is not associated
  with risk of breast cancer. However, the case against consuming milk in adulthood
  appears to be compelling. One study of rats with carcinogen-induced mammary tumors
  found that while removing the ovaries of rats reduced the number and size of the
  tumors, feeding milk to similar ovariectomized rats led to increases in mammary
  tumor incidence, tumor number and tumor volume. Consumption of both nonfat and whole
  milk also has been found to increase the incidence and volume of tumors in experimental
  rats with carcinogen-induced mammary tumors. Several major population-based studies
  have found that milk consumption is positively associated with the risk of breast
  cancer. High intake of animal fats has been linked in several studies to increased
  breast density, a risk factor for breast cancer and recurrence.


  One study found that bovine leukemia virus, which is prevalent in U.S. dairy herds,
  could contribute to human breast cancer. Some observers have noted that much of
  the milk we drink today is produced from pregnant cows, in which estrogen and progesterone
  levels are markedly elevated. Other components of milk that are suspected to be
  breast cancer promoting include saturated fat, recombinant bovine growth hormone,
  insulin-like growth factor, pesticides, and polychlorinated biphenyls. Since cream
  concentrates some of the potentially harmful substances found in milk, it is also
  to be avoided.
