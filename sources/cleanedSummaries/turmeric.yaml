  Curcumin has been shown in the laboratory to have profound and diverse effects on
  breast cancer carcinogenesis, proliferation and metastasis. Furthermore, these anticancer
  actions have been observed against several types of breast cancer, including estrogen
  receptor positive and progesterone receptor positive, ER negative and PR negative,
  and HER2/neu overexpressing cell lines. Some degree of selectivity for cancer cells
  also has been observed.


  Adding curcumin to chemotherapy regimes that include Taxol, Adriamycin, or 5-Fluorouracil  has
  been shown to enhance their cytotoxicity. Curcumin might also protect the brain
  from chemotherapy, thereby possibly reducing chemo brain. On the other hand, supplementation
  with curcumin has been shown to interfere with the effectiveness of tamoxifen treatment.


  Curcumin has been shown to be an iron chelator, which may be helpful in reducing
  iron for some women, but could negatively impact women with marginal stores of iron,
  especially those undergoing chemotherapy.


  Curcumin has been found in mouse models to effectively protect skin from radiation
  damage, while at the same time sensitizing breast cancer cells to radiation and
  making them more susceptible to its effects. Therefore, it appears that adding turmeric
  to the diet during radiation treatment does not lessen the radiations effectiveness
  and could be beneficial. Also, there is some evidence that turmeric could help protect
  normal breast cells from radiation-induced cancer.


  Curcumin has been shown to inhibit progestin-accelerated mammary tumors in rats.
  Combined hormone therapy containing both estrogen and progestin has been found to
  result in increased risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal women. Treatment with
  curcumin was found to postpone the first appearance of progestin-accelerated tumors,
  decrease overall tumor incidence, and reduce proliferation. These results suggest
  that curcumin might be an effective a dietary chemopreventive agent in women already
  exposed to combined hormone therapy.


  Although turmeric contains up to 5% curcumin, the bioavailability of curcumin in
  turmeric is limited, apparently because of poor absorption and rapid elimination
  from the body. Therefore, the levels of curcumin used in laboratory experiments
  to assess its chemoprotective effects typically are many times higher than that
  which would result from consuming turmeric in the diet. However, we recommend consuming
  turmeric as food rather than taking curcumin supplements, whose safety and effective
  dosages for breast cancer patients and survivors have not been established.


  While the in vitro and in vivo evidence of curcumins anti-cancer activities is remarkable,
  there have been no population studies that specifically address the association
  between turmeric consumption and the risk of breast cancer. India, where turmeric
  is a dietary staple, has lower overall cancer rates and breast cancer rates than
  countries in the West. One 2005 study found that south Asian women  living in California
  were 3.5 times more likely to develop breast cancer than native Asian Indian females.
  However, these results likely are the result of a variety of non-dietary as well
  as various dietary factors.
