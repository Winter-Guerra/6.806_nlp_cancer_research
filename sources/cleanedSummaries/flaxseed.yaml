  Flaxseed and its component have been shown to reduce breast cancer cell growth and
  enhance breast cancer cell apoptosis. These studies have demonstrated that flaxseed
  can reduce the growth and proliferation of both ER- and ER+ breast cancers.


  A meta-analysis combining the results of seven studies found that plant lignan consumption
  was associated with reduced risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal women. A major
  Swedish prospective study found a reduction in risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal
  women for those in the highest quartile of plant lignan intake, especially among
  hormone replacement therapy users. The reduction in risk did not vary by ER or PR
  status of the tumors. Another study reported that high circulating levels of enterolactone
  reduce the risk of breast cancer recurrence and death among postmenopausal women,
  especially those with estrogen receptor negative  breast cancer.


  As noted above, flaxseed is a good source of melatonin. Melatonin protects against
  breast cancer in several ways, including by reducing aromatase activity within the
  breast, thereby reducing estrogen production.


  Flaxseed has been shown to protect the lungs during radiation for lung cancer without
  reducing the efficacy of the treatment. Flaxseed has also been shown to enhance
  the effectiveness of both tamoxifen and Herceptin. Flaxseed has been shown to counteract
  the breast cancer promoting effects of the soy isoflavone genistein on ER+ breast
  cancer in mice.


  One study comparing flax seeds with sesame seeds  came to the conclusion that the
  breast cancer protective qualities of flaxseed were due to its high -linolenic acid
  content as much as its lignan content. Another study concluded that the lignan component
  of flaxseed appears to be most beneficial throughout the promotional phase of carcinogenesis
  whereas the oil component is more effective at the stage when tumors have already
  been established. Both flaxseed and flaxseed oil have been shown to be associated
  with reduced risk of breast cancer. Since flaxseed contains both the lignans and
  the oil, it appears preferable, on balance, to flaxseed oil.
