Parsley contains the flavones apigenin, luteolin, chrysoeriol, the flavonols quercetin, myricetin and isorhamnetin, and the isoflavone genistein. Parsley is a good dietary source of apigenin, which has been shown to induce apoptosis in human skin, thyroid, gastric, liver, colon, cervical, and prostate cancer cells, and to inhibit migration and invasion of ovarian cancer cells. Apigenin has also been shown to exhibit potent growth-inhibitory effects in HER2/neu overexpressing breast cancer cells. The growth-inhibitory effects of apigenin are less powerful for those cells expressing normal levels of HER2/neu. Luteolin has been shown to induce apoptosis in oral cancer calls, to promote cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in colon cancer cells, and to inhibit insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) receptor signaling in prostate cancer cells. Luteolin has also been shown increase the anti-cancer effects of the chemotherapy drug Taxol (paclitaxel). Quercetin has been shown to inhibit proliferation of estrogen receptor negative (ER-) breast cancer cells. A major Italian population study including 2,569 women with breast cancer found that the risk of breast cancer was reduced for increasing intake of flavones and flavonols.
