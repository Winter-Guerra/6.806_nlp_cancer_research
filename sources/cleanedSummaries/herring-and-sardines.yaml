  Like other fatty fish, herring contains the marine fatty acids docosahexaenoic acid  and
  eicosapentaenoic acid, which have chemopreventive properties. These marine fatty
  acids have been shown to inhibit proliferation of breast cancer cells in the laboratory.
  Relatively high fatty fish intake has been shown to be associated with reduced risk
  of breast cancer and improved survival. In one experiment, diets incorporating higher
  omega-3 to omega-6 fatty acid ratios reduced mammary gland density in mice, which
  in turn reduced carcinogen-induced mammary tumor development. Fish oil has been
  shown to inhibit early stages of mammary tumor development in a mouse model of HER-2/neu
  overexpressing  breast cancer. DHA has been demonstrated to reduce bone metastasis
  in a mouse model of breast cancer.


  Many epidemiological studies have found convincing evidence of a negative association
  between DHA and EPA intake or fatty fish consumption and the risk of breast cancer,
  but not all are in agreement. A study of Finnish fishermen and their wives found
  that while their high fish consumption appeared to reduce mortality overall, it
  did not reduce mortality from cancer in the women. A Swedish study comparing the
  breast cancer rates of two large groups of fishermens wives found a lower risk of
  breast cancer for those residing on the west coast of Sweden compared to the east  coast,
  where the fish are known to be contaminated with more organochlorine compounds.


  Several studies have found that higher omega-3/omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid
  ratios are associated with reduced risk of breast cancer and consuming herring or
  similar fish would tend to improve this ratio for most women.


  Marine fatty acids have also been found to enhance the therapeutic effects of tamoxifen
  and chemotherapy drugs such as Adriamycin and Taxol. However, note that recent research
  suggests that herring, sardines and similar fish such as anchovies should not be
  consumed the day before through the day after a chemotherapy treatment and consumed
  only in moderation during the remaining days of each cycle. Herring and similar
  fish contain a fatty acid  that can induce resistance to a broad spectrum of chemotherapy
  drugs.
