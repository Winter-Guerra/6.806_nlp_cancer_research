  Walnuts are a good source of alpha-linolenic acid, as well as numerous phytosterols,
  polyphenols and carotenoids, and soluble fiber. Walnuts are also a dietary source
  of selenium, copper, vitamin E and melatonin. Walnuts have the highest total phenolic
  content, flavonoid content, and antioxidant activity of the nuts commonly consumed
  in the U.S. Walnut consumption is associated with reduced risks of coronary vascular
  disease, type 2 diabetes, and blood clot formation, and has been shown to lower
  cholesterol. Despite the high caloric and fat content of nuts, adding a moderate
  amount of nuts to the diet has been shown not to result in weight gain. Walnut extract
  has been shown to reduce the proliferation of liver cancer and colon cancer cells
  in a dose-dependent manner. Ellagic acid, a major antioxidant component of walnuts,
  has been found to inhibit cell growth and induce apoptosis in cervical cancer cells.


  Consumption of alpha-linolenic acid is associated with reduced breast cancer risk.
  Walnuts are the best source of this plant-derived omega-3 fatty acid. Walnut consumption
  has been shown in several studies to significantly reduce breast tumor incidence
  and size in laboratory mice. For example, one study reported that a diet including
  walnuts reduced the tumor size produced by triple negative  breast cancer cells
  injected into mice.


  The melatonin in walnuts protects against breast cancer in several ways, including
  by reducing aromatase activity within the breast, thereby reducing estrogen production.


  Walnut oil has a high content of essential fatty acids and we would recommend it.
  Unrefined walnut oil is made from nuts that are dried and then cold-pressed, preserving
  its nutrient content. Walnut oil is best used at room temperature  since frying
  with or heating the oil can produce a slight bitterness, as well as destroying some
  of its antioxidant content.
