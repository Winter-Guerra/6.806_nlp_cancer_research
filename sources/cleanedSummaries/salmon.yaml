  Like other fatty fish, salmon contains the marine fatty acids docosahexaenoic acid  and
  eicosapentaenoic acid, which have chemopreventive properties. These marine fatty
  acids have been shown to inhibit proliferation of breast cancer cells in the laboratory.
  Relatively high fatty fish intake has been shown to be associated with reduced risk
  of breast cancer and improved survival. In one experiment, higher omega-3 to omega-6
  fatty acid diets reduced mammary gland density in mice, which in turn reduced carcinogen-induced
  mammary tumor development. Fish oil has been shown to inhibit early stages of mammary
  tumor development in a mouse model of HER-2/neu overexpressing  breast cancer. DHA
  has been demonstrated to reduce bone metastasis in a mouse model of breast cancer.
  Another study found that docosahexaenoic acid increased survial times for almost
  half of a group of stage IV breast cancer patients on FEC  chemotherapy. Fish protein
  hydrolysates also have been shown to have antiproliferative activity against human
  breast cancer cell lines in vitro.


  Many epidemiological studies have found convincing evidence of a negative association
  between DHA and EPA intake or fatty fish consumption and the risk of breast cancer,
  although not all are in agreement. In addition, several studies have found that
  higher omega-3 to omega-6 fatty acid intakes are associated with reduced risk of
  breast cancer; consuming wild salmon would tend to improve this ratio for most women.
