  Rhubarb is a good source of vitamin C, calcium, magnesium and dietary fiber. Rhubarb
  contains the carotenoids lutein and zeaxanthin, which have been shown to have some
  anticancer activities. Rhubarb has also been shown to have anti-inflammatory, anti-atherosclerosis
  and plaque-stabilizing actions in laboratory animals.
