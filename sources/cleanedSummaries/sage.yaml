  Sage refers to the leaves of the plant Salvia officinalis, a member of the mint
  family. Sage has been found to have antiseptic, antimicrobial, astringent, antioxidant,
  anti-inflammatory, antifungal, antiviral, hypoglycemic, antiatherogenic and antimutagenic
  properties. Sage contains numerous biologically active compounds, including caffeic
  acid, camphor, carnosol, carnosic acid, cineol, epirosmanol, galdosol, genistein,
  isorosmanol, limonene, luteolin, rosmanol, rosmarinic acid, thujone, and ursolic
  acid. Sage has been found to have anti-diabetic effects, reducing levels of serum
  glucose, triglycerides, and total cholesterol, and increasing plasma insulin in
  diabetic rats but not in normal rats. Sage has been shown to improve memory retention
  in both Alzheimers patients and college-age subjects, however long-term heavy use
  can cause seizures or other neurological symptoms due to sages thujone content.
