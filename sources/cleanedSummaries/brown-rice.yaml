  While all types of rice  are a good source of energy, white rice  contains a limited
  amount of micronutrients. White rice is a dietary source of potassium, magnesium,
  and calcium, as well as copper, iron, molybdenum, manganese, zinc, geranylgeranoic
  acid and vitamin B6. The positive health-related benefits of consuming rice are
  for the most part limited to brown  rice, not white rice. Brown rice has been shown
  to have antioxidant, hypoglycemic, anti-inflammatory, antimutagenic and cardioprotective
  properties. Brown rice contains numerous biologically active substances, including
  the carotenoids beta-carotene, lutein and zeaxanthin, as well as tricin, -tocopherol,
  -tocotrienol, -oryzanol, caffeic acid, ferulic acid, methoxycinnamic acid, phytic
  acid, and momilactone B. Black, purple and red rice also contain the anthocyanins
  cyanidin 3-glucoside, peonidin 3-glucoside, malvidin, and cyanidin hexoside, as
  well as several cyanidin dihexosides.


  Brown rice or its components have been shown to induce apoptosis and inhibit proliferation
  of human lymphoma, Ehrlich ascites carcinoma, myeloma, colorectal cancer and liver
  cancer cells and carcinogen-induced colon cancer in laboratory rats. Fermented brown
  rice has been shown to inhibit carcinogen-induced development of oral, stomach,
  and colon cancer in rats. Consumption of brown rice has been shown to be associated
  with reduced risk of pancreatic cancer in a San Francisco bay area population.


  Phytic acid  has been shown to induce marked growth inhibition in breast cancer
  cells without harming normal cells. Purple rice bran extract reduced vascular endothelial
  growth factor -induced angiogenesis by inhibiting proliferation and migration in
  one cell study. A study that examined the anti-cancer activity of eight brown rice
  phenols  found that caffeic acid, ferulic acid, and tricin each were effective in
  reducing the colony-forming ability of triple negative breast cancer cells.


  An anthocyanin-rich extract from black rice reduced the viability of several breast
  cancer cell lines in another study. The same study found that the extract significantly
  suppressed tumor growth and angiogenesis in mice implanted with HER2/neu overexpressing  tumors.
  Brown rice has been shown to inhibit the growth and proliferation of mouse mammary
  tumors. One study reported that a compound found in rice bran sensitized metastatic
  hormone receptor positive breast cancer cells to Taxol.


  Rice represents a major path of arsenic exposure for people who depend on a rice
  diet. Generally speaking, rice has more elevated arsenic levels than all other grains,
  with brown rice having higher levels than white rice. Arsenic is contributed both
  by arsenic in the soil and arsenic in rice field water, much of which is naturally
  occurring. A 2008 report found unacceptable arsenic levels in common U.K. brands
  of baby foods. Most of the rice in the baby foods were thought to come from Europe.
  Ten of the 17 samples tested used organically grown rice. Similar concerns have
  been raised concerning rice in U.S. baby foods.


  High levels of arsenic have been reported in rice from areas of the United States
  where former cotton fields have been converted to rice production. Arsenic herbicides
  were used in cotton fields in the early to mid-20th century. In addition, southern
  Louisiana is home to numerous oil refineries and petrochemical plants that have
  introduced cadmium and other carcinogenic contaminants to some of the soil used
  for rice production. Cadmium exposure has been associated with increased risk of
  breast cancer, among other cancers. Although the U.S. is a net rice exporter, it
  imports specialty rice varieties such as jasmine and Basmati rice from countries
  such as Thailand and India. This rice is often grown under conditions and using
  pesticides and fungicides that would be unacceptable inside U.S. borders. Rice grown
  in California is most likely to have low levels of arsenic, cadmium and other contaminants.


  Brown rice syrup, which is not regulated in the U.S. with respect to arsenic and
  other heavy metal content, may be produced from rice sourced from countries with
  high levels of contamination. Brown rice syrup is a sweetener found in some cereal
  and high energy bars and high energy drinks, including those with the organic label.
  Since it is impossible for consumers to evaulate the safety of brown rice syrup,
  foods containing this ingredient should be limited or avoided.


  Chinese red yeast rice  is a food spice and medicinal herb made by fermenting a
  type of yeast  with white rice. It contains a mixture of monacolins, one of which
  is essentially identical to lovastin, a statin used for lowering cholesterol. Chinese
  red yeast rice has been shown to inhibit tumor cell growth and enhance apoptosis
  of breast and colon cancer cells. It also has been found to inhibit both androgen-dependent
  and androgen-independent prostate tumor growth in human prostate cancer xenografts
  in mice. However, note that when nine different commercially available Chinese red
  yeast rice dietary supplements were tested in one study, the total monacolin content
  ranged from 0% to 0.58% w/w and only one of the preparations contained all 10 possible
  monacolins. In addition, measurable concentrations of citrinin, a mycotoxin known
  to cause kidney damage, was found in seven of the nine samples.


  Wild rice  refers to four species of plants, three of which are native to North
  America, that are closely related to rice. The anthocyanins in wild rice, black
  rice and other darkly pigmented rice are degraded least by stovetop cooking. Using
  a pressure cooker results in the most thermal degradation, followed by using a rice
  cooker.


  White rice has been stripped of much of the chemopreventive compounds and fiber
  that make brown rice a healthy food choice. A 2011 study found a link between increased
  starch intake after a diagnosis of early-stage breast cancer and a greater risk
  of recurrence.


  Rice bran oil is used as a cooking oil and salad oil in parts of Asia. It is valued
  for its high smoking point and delicate flavor. While rice bran oil appears to have
  some chemopreventive properties, not enough information is available to make a recommendation
  with respect to its consumption.
