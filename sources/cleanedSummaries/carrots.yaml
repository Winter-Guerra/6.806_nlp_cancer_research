  Consumption of carrots has been found to be associated with reduced risk of breast
  cancer in numerous  population studies. This protective effect appears to be due
  to the interaction of multiple components of carrots, not just the presence of alpha-carotene
  and beta-carotene. Higher levels of carotenoids and vitamin A  in the blood of breast
  cancer survivors have both been found to be associated with greater likelihood of
  breast cancer-free survival.
