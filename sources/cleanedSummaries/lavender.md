Lavender essential oil has been shown to have a high antioxidant content and a component of lavender, perillyl alcohol, has been studied in cancer prevention. However, lavender essential oil (in the concentrations found in commercial hair care and body cream products) was reported to cause breast enlargement in otherwise healthy and normal boys in one well known 2007 New England Journal of Medicine article. While there have not been any follow up studies that confirmed the estrogenic effects of lavender-containing skin products, applying lavender creams or oils to the skin appears unwise.
