Consumption of alpha-linolenic acid is associated with reduced breast cancer risk. Walnuts are the best source of this plant-derived omega-3 fatty acid. Walnut consumption has been shown in several studies to significantly reduce breast tumor incidence and size in laboratory mice. For example, one study reported that a diet including walnuts reduced the tumor size produced by triple negative (ER-/PR-/HER2-) breast cancer cells injected into mice.

The melatonin in walnuts protects against breast cancer in several ways, including by reducing aromatase activity within the breast, thereby reducing estrogen production.
