  Ginger has been found to significantly inhibit mammary tumorigenesis and tumor growth
  in laboratory mice when fed in drinking water. Ginger components 6-Shogaol and -gingerol
  have been shown to inhibit cell adhesion, invasion, and motility in both hormone
  receptor positive  and triple negative  human breast cancer cells in the laboratory.


  Ginger has been found to be effective in treating chemotherapy-induced nausea and
  vomiting, although not all studies agree. The key appears to be to take the ginger
  before undergoing a chemotherapy treatment as well as afterwards. However, it has
  not been determined whether this reduction in gastrointestinal symptoms is accompanied
  by a reduction in the effectiveness of chemotherapy. Until more research establishes
  the safety of using ginger during chemotherapy, we do not recommend it.


  On the other hand, ginger should be avoided during radiation treatment since it
  has been shown to help protect cells against the cytotoxic effects of radiation.
