Potato extract has been shown to suppress proliferation of mouse mammary carcinoma cells. Fried potatoes were found in one study to be associated with increased risk of ER- breast cancer. Various "meat and potatoes" dietary patterns have been found to be associated with increased risks of many cancer types, including breast cancer. However, it is possible that these heightened risks may be due primarily to red meat and fried potato consumption. A 2011 study found a link between increased starch intake after a diagnosis of early-stage breast cancer and a greater risk of recurrence.
