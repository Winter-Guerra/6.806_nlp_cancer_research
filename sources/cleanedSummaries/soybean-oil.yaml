  Soybean oil is mainly comprised of fat. Major fatty acids in soybean oil include
  linoleic acid, oleic acid, palmitic acid, alpha-linolenic acid, and stearic acid.
  Linoleic acid, an omega-6 fatty acid, is the most prevalent polyunsaturated fatty
  acid in the U.S. diet. It is found in most foods we eat, including meats, dairy
  foods, vegetables, vegetable oils, fruits, legumes, nuts, seeds, cereals and breads.
  Since linoleic acid is the metabolic precursor of arachidonic acid, concern has
  been raised that dietary linoleic acid could increase arachidonic acid content and
  eicosanoid formation in the body and thereby promote cancers, cardiovascular disease,
  inflammation, and related disorders. Arachidonic acid also has been shown to increase
  aromatase activity, thus increasing circulating estrogen. Linoleic acid has been
  shown to encourage the growth of mammary tumors in mice.


  Oleic acid is a monounsaturated fatty acid also found in olive oil. The evidence
  is mixed regarding oleic acid and breast cancer: oleic acid has been found both
  to promote and to inhibit breast cancer, depending on the mixture of other fatty
  acids and other components of the foods in which it is found. Alpha-linolenic acid
  is an omega-3 fatty acid. The protective effect on breast cancer risk of omega-3
  fatty acids depends in part on the relative level of omega-6 fatty acids. The ratio
  of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids in soybean oil is 7-to-1, so that consumption
  is likely to increase the ratio in the direction considered harmful.


  Although the fatty acid profile of soybean oil is suggestive of an unfavorable impact
  on breast cancer risk, fatty acid analysis must be combined with more direct evidence
  since different combinations of the same fatty acids can have different effects.
  Studies evaluating the impact of soybean oil on breast cancer are rare since this
  oil is not suspected to have a beneficial effect. Where soybean oil is used, it
  is often compared another, more promising oil. One such study found that, unlike
  fish oil, soybean oil did not inhibit the growth of human breast cancer cells. Another
  study found that the incidence of carcinogen-induced mammary tumors was higher in
  rats on a diet supplemented with 10% soybean oil than those on a 10% perilla oil
  diet.


  Population studies specifically examining the impact of soybean oil on risk of breast
  cancer are also relatively rare. Several Asian studies have focused on the carcinogenic
  effects of the fumes and smoke generated by cooking oils. Soybean oil has been found
  to form 4-hydroxy-2-trans-nonenal, a mutagenic and cytotoxic product of the peroxidation
  of linoleic acid, when heated to 365 degrees Fahrenheit, suggesting that soybean
  oil should not be used for deep frying. Another study found that soybean oil generated
  a greater amount of carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the smoke during
  heating than canola oil or sunflower oil. Breathing fumes and smoke from cooking
  oil has been found to be associated with higher risk of lung cancer in several Chinese
  studies.


  One U.S. study that examined the association between the type of fat used in cooking
  and the risk of breast cancer found that women cooking primarily with vegetable/corn
  oil  had a 30% higher risk of breast cancer than women normally using olive/canola
  oil.
