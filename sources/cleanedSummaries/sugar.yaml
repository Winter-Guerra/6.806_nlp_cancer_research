  Sweetened soda consumption has been shown to increase the level of circulating estradiol,
  a known risk factor for breast cancer, in premenopausal women. High sugar consumption
  is associated with increased breast density, a powerful risk factor for breast cancer.
  One study evaluated carcinogen-induced mammary tumors in rats fed diets containing
  high levels of either sugar  or starch. Rats fed sugar diets were found to develop
  significantly more mammary tumors than those fed starch diets, at both low and high
  levels of dietary fat.


  A U.S. case-control study found that consumption of sweets, particularly desserts,
  was associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. An Italian case-control
  study found that women with the highest intake of desserts  and sugars  had increased
  risk of breast cancer. The results held when adjusted for body mass index and total
  calorie intake. A Mexican case-control study found that carbohydrate intake was
  positively associated with risk of breast cancer for both premenopausal and postmenopausal
  women after adjusting for total calorie intake. The strongest associations were
  observed for sucrose and fructose intake. Another Italian case-control study found
  that breast cancer risk increased with increasing consumption of bread, pasta and
  refined sugar. A Japanese case-control study found that breast cancer risk was positively
  associated with higher intakes of bread, cake, and soft drinks with sugar.


  A Canadian prospective study found higher risk of breast cancer among postmenopausal
  women consuming high glycemic index foods, an association that was not altered when
  adjusted for body mass. On the other hand, a Danish prospective study found no associations
  between intake of glucose, fructose, sucrose, maltose, lactose, or starch and breast
  cancer risk. However, a borderline significant positive association between high
  glycemic index foods and estrogen receptor negative  breast cancer was found in
  this study.
