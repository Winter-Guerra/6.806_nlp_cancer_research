  Adzuki beans  are small, usually red, beans popular in Japan and other parts of
  Asia. Adzuki beans, which are also known as azuki beans, are the principal ingredient
  in the red bean paste found in many Asian dishes and sweets. Adzuki bean phenolics
  include catechin and epicatechin glucosides, procyanidin dimers, myricetin and protocatechuic
  acid. The principal fatty acids in adzuki bean are linoleic acid and oleic acid.
  Adzuki beans have been shown to have antioxidant, hypoglycemic, antitumorigenesis,
  and hepatoprotective actions, as well as lowering cholesterol and triglyceride levels.
  Adzuki bean extracts have been shown to inhibit metastasis of lung cancer and melanoma
  in the laboratory, as well as inhibiting the growth and proliferation of carcinogen-induced
  stomach cancer.


  Ethanol extracts of adzuki beans have been found to increase proliferation of estrogen
  and progesterone responsive  human breast cancer cells. The estrogenic effects of
  adzuki bean appears to have unique characteristics compared to that of other beans
  with significant phytoestrogen content.


  In Asia and Asian cuisine, red beans normally refers to adzuki beans, whereas in
  the Americas red beans  refers to the larger common red dry beans. Mung bean paste
  can be used as a healthier substitute for red bean paste in many dishes.


  Note that while we are continually searching for new evidence concerning this food,
  there is not much interest in it among cancer researchers so few recent studies
  are available.
