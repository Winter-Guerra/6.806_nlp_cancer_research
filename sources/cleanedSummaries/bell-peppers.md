Apigenin, a flavonoid component of bell peppers, has been shown to exhibit potent growth-inhibitory effects in HER2/neu-overexpressing breast cancer cells. Several Korean studies have found an association between bell pepper consumption and lower incidence of breast cancer. On the other hand, no significant inverse association of breast cancer with intake of green peppers was found in a 2004 study based on the Nurses Health Study II cohort.
