  Various isothiocyanates derived from turnips or turnip greens have been found to
  have chemopreventive activity against a variety of breast cancer cell lines in the
  laboratory. A Chinese study which measured urinary isothiocyanate levels as a marker
  of brassica vegetable intake found that higher levels were protective against breast
  cancer in both premenopausal and postmenopausal women. Turnip consumption has been
  found to be associated with lower risk of breast cancer in U.S., Chinese, Japanese,
  and Korean women.
