  Turnips, a type of cruciferous vegetable, are a dietary source of vitamin C, calcium,
  iron and some copper, as well as potassium and magnesium. Turnip greens are an excellent
  source of vitamin C, vitamin K, vitamin E, folate, vitamin B6, beta carotene, lutein
  and zeaxanthin, as well as manganese, calcium, and copper. Turnip greens also contain
  meaningful levels of riboflavin, potassium, magnesium and iron. Turnip greens contain
  kaempferol, -phenylethyl isothiocyanate and various other isothiocyanates, and some
  sulforaphane, all of which have been reported to have anti-cancer properties. Turnips
  and turnip greens have been shown to have antimicrobial, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory
  properties. Turnip consumption has been found to be associated with reduced risks
  of esophageal, lung, gastric, bladder, colorectal and prostate cancer. Turnip green
  consumption has been found to be associated with reduced risks of gastric, bladder,
  and prostate cancer.


  Various isothiocyanates derived from turnips or turnip greens have been found to
  have chemopreventive activity against a variety of breast cancer cell lines in the
  laboratory. A Chinese study which measured urinary isothiocyanate levels as a marker
  of brassica vegetable intake found that higher levels were protective against breast
  cancer in both premenopausal and postmenopausal women. Turnip consumption has been
  found to be associated with lower risk of breast cancer in U.S., Chinese, Japanese,
  and Korean women.


  Cruciferous vegetables contain thioglucoside compounds that can interfere with the
  formation of thyroid hormone.
