  The evidence that blackberries could be beneficial in fighting breast cancer is
  derived in part from studies of other berries, as well as of blackberries in particular.


  Blackberries contain cyandin-3-glucoside, lignans, ellagic acid, the flavonoid myricetin
  and other potentially beneficial substances. Cyandin-3-glucoside has been shown
  to possess both chemo preventive and chemotherapeutic activity. Postmenopausal women
  with breast cancer and a high intake of plant lignans have been found to be less
  likely to die from their breast cancer than those with a low intake. Ellagic acid
  has been shown to inhibit cancer formation. Myricetin has antioxidant properties.
  The combination of chemicals in blackberries may more effectively prevent cancer
  than any one of the component chemicals alone.


  Blackberries contain relatively high levels of phytoestrogens  compared to other
  berries.


  Marionberries are a type of blackberry. Loganberries are a hybrid cross between
  between a blackberry and a raspberry.
