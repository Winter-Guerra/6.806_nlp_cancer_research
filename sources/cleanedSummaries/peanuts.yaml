  Peanuts contain resveratrol and are an excellent source of monounsaturated fat.
  Consumption of peanuts is associated with lower levels of inflammatory markers,
  which may account for the inverse relationship between nut consumption and risk
  of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. Peanuts have also been shown to promote
  weight management when consumed as part of a moderate fat diet because of its satiating
  effect. Frequent peanut consumption is associated with a reduced risk of gallstone
  disease in men. Peanut extracts have been shown to suppress the proliferation of
  human prostate cancer cells.
