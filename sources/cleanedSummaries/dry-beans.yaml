  One study found six flavonoids in the coats of black beans with potent antiproliferative
  activities against hormone receptor positive  breast cancer cells. Another study
  found that tanins isolated from black beans inhibited angiogenesis. Several studies
  have found that dry bean consumption reduces mammary tumor incidence and number
  in rats. One study that examined the cellular processes by which tumor burden was
  reduced reported that the dominant process was induction of apoptosis. Circuling
  insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1  were also reduced.


  A study of the diets of 90,630 women in the Nurses Health Study II found a significant
  inverse relationship between breast cancer and the intake of beans. Another study
  found that higher intake of dry beans improved survival among postmenopausal women
  with breast cancer. The authors attributed this survival advantage to the lignan
  content of beans.
