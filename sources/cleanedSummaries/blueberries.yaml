  Blueberries have been found to inhibit mammary cancer cell proliferation in mice
  and rats, as well as inhibiting cultured cancer cell growth in the laboratory and
  blood vessel tumors in rats. Pterostilbene has been shown to inhibit obesity-related
  breast cancer growth and proliferation in the laboratory and to have additive treatment
  effects when combined with tamoxifen in estrogen receptor positive  breast cancer
  cells. Pterostilbene also has been shown to reduce the formation of breast cancer
  stem cells and inhibit their metastatic activities.


  Blueberries are a good source of resveratrol, which has been shown to increase the
  effects of radiation, aromatase inhibitors and the chemotherapy drug Taxol  against
  breast cancer.


  Blueberry extract has been shown to exhibit antitumor activity against MDA-MB-231
  triple negative breast cancer cells and reduce their metastatic potential. Blueberry
  was found to inhibit cell proliferation in triple negative cells with no effect
  on normal breast cells in one study. Blueberry also reduced the metastatic potential
  of triple negative cells through inhibition of cell motility.


  In animal studies, dietary blueberry has been shown to reduce triple negative tumor
  volume in female mice. Blueberry diets reduced triple negative proliferation  and
  increased cell death. In addition, a blueberry diet inhibited triple negative tumor
  metastasis in another mouse study. Analysis of tumor tissues has demonstrated that
  blueberry-fed mice tumors have significantly altered expression of genes important
  to inflammation, cancer, and metastasis.
