The flavone apigenin has been shown to exhibit potent growth-inhibitory effects in HER2/neu overexpressing breast cancer cells; exposure of HER2+ breast cancer cells to apigenin results in induction of apoptosis by depleting HER2/neu protein. The growth-inhibitory effects of apigenin are less powerful for those cells expressing normal levels of HER2/neu. Perillyl alcohol has been shown to inhibit both ER+ and ER- human breast cancer cell growth and suppress growth and metastasis in a nude mouse model.

Celery has been shown to have a modest ability to inhibit aromatase activity (the synthesis of estrogen from androgens within the body), which is important for reducing growth-stimulatory effects in estrogen-dependent breast cancer. A major Italian population study including 2,569 women with breast cancer found that the risk of breast cancer was reduced for increasing intake of flavones such as apigenin and luteolin in the diet.
