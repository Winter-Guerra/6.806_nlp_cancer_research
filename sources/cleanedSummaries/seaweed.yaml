text: "\n\nThe evidence that seaweed consumption could reduce the risk of breast cancer
  is based primarily on studies of brown seaweeds:\n\n   Consumption of brown seaweeds
  has been shown to favorably alter estrogen metabolism in women. Extract of common
  kelp has been shown to inhibit the binding of estradiol to estrogen receptors and
  progesterone to the progesterone receptor. Bladderwrack  has been found to exert
  anti-estrogenic effects in pre-menopausal women\n   Specific unique components  of
  brown seaweeds have been shown to inhibit cancer cell proliferation. However, red
  seaweeds, which lack these compounds, also inhibit proliferation, suggesting that
  other compounds found in seaweed may also be important\n   Seaweed in the Asian
  diet may enhance intestinal conversion of phytoestrogens, in particular the production
  of equol, which could explain some of the breast cancer protective effects of dietary
  seaweed and soy\n   The brown seaweed wakame  has been shown to contain the omega-3
  fats eicosapentaenoic acid and stearidonic acid, which may favorably increase the
  omega-3/omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid ratio. Some other types of seaweed have
  been found to contain docosahexaenoic acid, another marine omega-3 fat\n   Wakame
  was also found to reduce breast cancer proliferation in rats in one Japanese study\n
  \  Mekabu  extract has been shown to induce cell death in human hormone receptor
  negative  breast cancer cells and to suppress mammary carcinogenesis in rats when
  administered in daily drinking water, without toxicity\n   Various types of red,
  brown and green algae have been found to be good sources of melatonin. Melatonin
  protects against breast cancer in several ways, including by reducing aromatase
  activity within the breast, thereby reducing estrogen production\n   The relatively
  high iodine content of seaweed may contribute to reduction in risk of breast cancer\n
  \  The relatively high levels of calcium found in seaweed are also thought to contribute
  to seaweeds chemopreventive effects, in combination with its other components.\n\nWe
  suggest consuming seaweed as food rather than fucoidan, kelp or other seaweed supplements
  since  as outlined above, various components of seaweed in addition to fucoidan
  or iodine may be responsible for seaweeds apparent anti-carcinogenic effects;  the
  compounds, minerals and fiber found in seaweed may act synergistically to reduce
  cancer risk;  safe and effective levels of fucoidan have not been established;  supplementation
  may result in increased blood thinning, depending on the formulation.\n\n"
