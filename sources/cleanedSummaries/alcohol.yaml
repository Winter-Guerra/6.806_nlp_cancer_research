  Alcohol drinking is a well-established risk factor for breast cancer. Unlike some
  other risk factors which may require decades to result in invasive breast cancer,
  alcohol consumption increases the risk of breast cancer for younger women. Heavy
  alcohol consumption has been found to increase the risk of progression to invasive
  breast cancer among postmenopausal women with benign breast disease or DCIS. Alcohol
  consumption is associated with increased breast density, an important risk factor
  for breast cancer. This association is stronger in women with a family history of
  breast cancer. In fact, alcohol increases breast density most among women who are
  already at high risk of breast cancer due to other factors. Alcohol consumption
  by breast cancer survivors has been found to increase the risk of new breast cancer
  in the other breast, as well as distant recurrence.


  Alcohol consumption has been found to promote premenopausal tumor development in
  a mouse model of HER2 overexpressing breast cancer. Among postmenopausal women,
  alcohol consumption is more strongly associated with lobular breast cancer than
  ductal breast cancer and with ER+ disease than ER- disease.


  Tamoxifen use appears to amplify the alcohol-related risk for postmenopausal breast
  cancer survivors who consume alcohol. Hormone replacement therapy may also amplify
  the breast cancer-related risk of drinking.


  Drinking red wine is on balance harmful despite the presence of chemopreventative
  substances such as resveratrol in red wine. The question of whether wine consumption,
  and red wine in particular, is safer than other types of alcoholic drinks has been
  addressed in several population studies. Almost no studies have found a difference
  in breast cancer risk based type of drink. The increase in breast cancer risk derives
  from the ethanol content of alcoholic drinks. The other compounds found in drinks,
  including the polyphenols in beer and wine, do not appear to reduce the alcohol-associated
  risk. In fact, one 2012 French study reported that high dietary polyphenol intake
  reduced breast cancer risk in non drinkers and light drinkers but increased it in
  moderate to heavy drinkers. Note that alcohol-free red wines are available that
  might be a good substitute for some.


  One 2013 study suggested that consuming alcohol does not influence breast cancer
  survival, however this needs confirmation, especially at the breast cancer subtype
  level. Previous studies reported that as few as three drinks per week  increase
  both the risk of breast cancer and the risk of recurrence. The relationship between
  alcohol and breast cancer risk depends in part on a womans individual genetic makeup;
  for example, fast metabolizers of alcohol have been shown to have a higher risk
  of breast cancer from a given level of alcohol intake than slow metabolizers. Consuming
  several drinks at once may be more risky than limiting consumption to one drink
  per session. Based on the evidence to date, a glass of wine with food every other
  day might be a safe level of consumption.
