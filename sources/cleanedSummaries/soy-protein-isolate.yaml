  Evidence concerning the impact of soy protein isolate on breast cancer risk consists
  of animal studies and human experiments. Population studies concerning any possible
  association between soy protein isolate and risk of breast cancer are not available,
  which is especially unfortunate since experimental studies have produced conflicting
  findings.


  Feeding soy protein isolate to female rats has been shown in several studies to
  decrease carcinogen-induced mammary tumor incidence. The female offspring of the
  rats in one of these studies were found to have smaller mammary fat cells, lower
  abdominal fat mass and lower overall body weight. Another study found that while
  rats fed a soy protein isolate diet had a lower tumor incidence than rats fed a
  control diet, the tumors had more invasive characteristics. The authors ascribed
  the increased invasiveness to a higher ratio of progesterone receptor A to progesterone
  receptor B in the soy protein isolate group, accompanied by increased levels of
  HER-2/neu oncogene. However, note that soy protein isolate also contains relatively
  high levels of copper, which has been shown to increase angiogenesis and metastasis
  of breast cancer.


  Another study found that soy protein isolate stimulated estrogen positive breast
  tumor growth and increased uterus weight in ovariectomized mice. Yet another study
  found that a high soy protein diet increased mitosis  in the mammary glands of rats.
  The change in proliferation was associated with increased estrogen receptor   and
  decreased estrogen receptor   expression.


  A one-year study of the effects of soy protein isolate consumption in women that
  measured changes in nipple aspirate fluid and plasma hormones, cholesterol and triglycerides
  found that prolonged consumption of soy protein isolate with a defined level of
  genistein had little effect on postmenopausal women. However, a stimulatory effect
  on the breasts of the premenopausal women was observed, characterized by increased
  secretion of breast fluid, the appearance of hyperplastic epithelial breast cells,
  and increased levels of plasma estradiol. The authors note that these findings did
  not support their a priori hypothesis that soy protein isolate consumption would
  be protective against breast cancer.
