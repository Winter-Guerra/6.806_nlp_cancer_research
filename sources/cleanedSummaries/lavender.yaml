  Lavender essential oil has been shown to have a high antioxidant content and a component
  of lavender, perillyl alcohol, has been studied in cancer prevention. However, lavender
  essential oil  was reported to cause breast enlargement in otherwise healthy and

  of lavender-containing skin products, applying lavender creams or oils to the skin
  appears unwise.
