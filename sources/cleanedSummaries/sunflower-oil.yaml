  The relationships between oil and fat consumption and breast cancer are complex
  and appear to depend on the specific attributes of the oil or fat in question. It
  was originally thought that consumption of fat promoted breast cancer, regardless
  of the source of the fat. The focus then shifted to saturated versus unsaturated
  fat, with further refinements concerning monounsaturated fatty acids  and polyunsaturated
  fatty acids. More recently, the emphasis has shifted to the balance between omega-6
  and omega-3 fatty acids in the diet. The reason for these changes in emphasis is
  that none of the theories were found to hold consistently in population studies.
  While the theory that cancer is caused in part by an excess of omega-6 fatty acids
  in the Western diet appears to be valid, it is not a global explanation for the
  relationship between oils and fats and breast cancer. For example, it does not explain
  the fact that olive oil, which does not have a high omega-3 content, is protective
  against breast cancer.


  In the case of sunflower oil, there is evidence from experiments using either carcinogen-induced
  or transplanted animal mammary tumor models, as well as in vitro studies, which
  demonstrates that linoleic acid, the primary fatty acid in sunflower oil, promotes
  mammary tumor development.


  One study found that women with a specific genotype  who consumed a significant
  amount of linoleic acid in their diets had an increased risk of breast cancer. Another
  study found increased breast cancer risk among women cooking primarily with vegetable
  or corn oil compared to women using olive or canola oil.


  Women with breast cancer have been found to have higher levels of omega-6 in their
  breast tissue than similar women without breast cancer. Several studies have found
  that lower dietary omega-6/omega-3 ratios are associated with reduced risk of breast
  cancer. Consuming sunflower oil would tend to increase the ratio for most women
  because of its high omega-6 content.
