  By potatoes we mean white potatoes; sweet potatoes and yams are covered in another
  webpage. Consuming whole cooked potatoes with the peel has been shown to improve
  the cholesterol profile of laboratory rats. Potatoes are a good dietary source of
  vitamin C, vitamin B6, potassium, magnesium and zinc. Compounds with known cancer-fighting
  properties found in potatoes include glycoalkaloids such as -chaconine and -solanine,
  as well as gallic acid. Potato extracts have been shown to suppress proliferation
  and induce apoptosis of human lymphoma, liver, stomach, cervical, colon, and prostate
  cancer cells. One study found that overall mortality in older Dutch women was lower
  for women following a healthy modified traditional Dutch diet: the traditional diet
  was made healthier by reducing alcohol and meat consumption and increasing vegetable
  intake without eliminating potatoes. Potato consumption has been found to be associated
  with increased risks of oral and rectal cancer. Pan fried and French fried potatoes
  have also been found to be associated with higher risks of oral, laryngeal and esophageal
  cancers.


  Potato extract has been shown to suppress proliferation of mouse mammary carcinoma
  cells. Fried potatoes were found in one study to be associated with increased risk
  of ER- breast cancer. Various meat and potatoes dietary patterns have been found
  to be associated with increased risks of many cancer types, including breast cancer.
  However, it is possible that these heightened risks may be due primarily to red
  meat and fried potato consumption. A 2011 study found a link between increased starch
  intake after a diagnosis of early-stage breast cancer and a greater risk of recurrence.


  Potatoes typically are grown using a great deal of pesticides and significant levels
  of pesticides are typically present in potatoes whether purchased raw or in precooked
  forms such as hash browns or French fries. Studies have found increased mortality
  from hormone-dependent cancers in traditional potato-growing areas, presumably from
  potato pesticide exposure. Peeling potatoes reduces but does not eliminate pesticide
  exposure from the cooked food and it eliminates the vitamin D and other beneficial
  nutrients found primarily in the skin. Potatoes with red skins incorporate anthocyanins
  that are know to be provide some protection against breast cancer risk. We would
  suggest buying red-skinned organic potatoes and eating them  after steaming or boiling
  them.


  Acrylamide, a chemical contained in potato chips and French fries, among other foods,
  is a suspected carcinogen. Acrylamide intake within the range of U.S. diets has
  not been found to be associated with increased risk of breast cancer, nor does it
  appear to increase the risks of other cancer types. However, a 2012 Danish study
  reported that pre-diagnostic exposure to acrylamide was associated with increased
  mortality among breast cancer patients with ER+ breast cancer.


  The potato components alpha-chaconine and alpha-solanine both have been found to
  inhibit the growth of normal human liver cells in addition to inducing apoptosis
  of liver cancer cells. Medicinal potato extracts containing these compounds are
  to be avoided.
