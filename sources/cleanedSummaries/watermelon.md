Consumption of the watermelon, papaya and cantaloupe (taken together) was found to be associated with a lower risk of breast cancer in one 2009 study of Chinese women. However, a previous 2003 study found no reduction in breast cancer risk associated with watermelon consumption. Cucurbitacins, compounds found in watermelon, have been shown to induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in human breast cancer cells. The high carotenoid levels found in watermelon are also likely to offer protection against breast cancer.
