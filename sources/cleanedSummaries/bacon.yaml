  A large 2007 U.K. study found that both premenopausal and postmenopausal women with
  the highest processed meat intake had the highest risk of breast cancer. Another
  study found that higher red meat consumption during adolescence was associated with
  increased risk of premenopausal breast cancer in adulthood. A study of tissue removed
  from healthy women undergoing breast reduction surgery found that the levels of
  DNA adducts  in the breast tissue was correlated with the womens consumption of
  fried meat, beef and processed meat. High intake of animal fats has been linked
  in several studies to increased breast density, a risk factor for breast cancer
  and recurrence. Another study found that consumption of well done or fried meat  appeared
  to increase the risk of breast cancer in a dose-dependent manner. A study that examined
  the risks of recurrence and death following diagnosis with early-stage breast cancer
  found that both the risk of recurrence and the risk of death were positively correlated
  with the consumption of bacon, especially for premenopausal women.
