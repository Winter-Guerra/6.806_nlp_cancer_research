  Watermelon  is a rich dietary source of vitamin C and glutathione. Watermelon also
  is an excellent source of carotenoids such as lycopene, beta-carotene, and beta-cryptoxanthin,
  as well as L-citrulline  and a small fraction of cucurbitacins, all of which have
  been shown to have chemopreventive properties. Watermelon also has been shown to
  possess anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties, and to reduce cardiovascular
  risk factors by improving glycemic control and ameliorating vascular dysfunction
  in laboratory animals with type 2 diabetes.


  Consumption of the watermelon, papaya and cantaloupe  was found to be associated
  with a lower risk of breast cancer in one 2009 study of Chinese women. However,
  a previous 2003 study found no reduction in breast cancer risk associated with watermelon
  consumption. Cucurbitacins, compounds found in watermelon, have been shown to induce
  cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in human breast cancer cells. The high carotenoid
  levels found in watermelon are also likely to offer protection against breast cancer.


  Watermelons should be washed before cutting to remove pesticide residue. Although
  watermelon seeds and watermelon rind  are eaten by many peoples across the world,
  we have not been able to determine whether this practice is completely safe.


  Colocynth, also known as bitter apple or bitter cucumber, and bitter Hawkesbury
  watermelon  are closely related to watermelon, but with a much higher fraction of
  cucurbitacins. Colocynth and other high-cucurbitacin cucurbits are sometimes sold
  as herbal remedies, including for cancer. However, while chemotherapy based on cucurbitacins
  may eventually be developed, these are toxic chemicals whose safety profiles and
  appropriate dosages have not been determined.
