<p>Taken together, the mode of action of bendamustine includes induction of apoptosis. The specific spectrum of activity and the unexpectedly low clastogenicity support the hypothesis that bendamustine in not a typical alkylating agent but exerts an additional mode of action, possibly as a purine antimetabolite.Citation: Journal:None, Date:None</p>
<p>The presented mechanism-based enzyme induction model where the pharmacokinetics of the inducer and the enzyme pool counterbalance each other successfully described CP autoinduction. It is reasonable to believe that CP affects its own elimination by increasing the enzyme production rate and thereby increasing the amount of enzyme by which CP is eliminated.Citation: Journal:None, Date:None</p>
