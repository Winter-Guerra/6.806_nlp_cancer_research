<p>The results demonstrated that women receiving the Lucentia PeakÂ® multi-nutrient supplement had significant increases in their 2-HE:16alpha-HE ratio, which appears to be mediated primarily by increasing the 2-HE levels. These results suggest further research on phytonutrients that might positively affect estrogen metabolism is warranted.Citation: Journal:None, Date:None</p>
<p>The present study suggests the intake of flavonols and flavones, but not other flavonoid subclasses or total flavonoids, is associated with a decreased risk of breast cancer, especially among post-menopausal women.Citation: Journal:None, Date:None</p>
<p>It is suggested that active compounds of A. ilicifolius flower solved in methanol play a role to inhibit free radical activity and kill Artemia salina nauplii. The substances can be considered as potential antioxidant and cytotoxic agents as well as imminent candidate for cancer therapy.Citation: Journal:None, Date:None</p>
