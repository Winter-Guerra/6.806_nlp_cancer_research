<p>These pilot data suggest that dietary bladderwrack may prolong the length of the menstrual cycle and exert anti-estrogenic effects in pre-menopausal women. Further, these studies also suggest that seaweed may be another important dietary component apart from soy that is responsible for the reduced risk of estrogen-related cancers observed in Japanese populations. However, these studies will need to be performed in well-controlled clinical trials to confirm these preliminary findings.Citation: Journal:None, Date:None</p>
<p>Although there is suggestive evidence for a preventive role for iodine and selenium in breast cancer, rigorous retrospective and prospective studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis.Citation: Journal:None, Date:None</p>
<p>Mekabu extract activates caspases 3, 6, and 8 and contributes to intracellular signaling to induce apoptosis in a human breast cancer cell line. This signaling is not via the mitochondria.Citation: Journal:None, Date:None</p>
<p>These results indicated that fucosterol, the most abundant phytosterol in brown algae, is responsible for cytotoxic effect of this extract against breast and colon carcinoma cell lines.Citation: Journal:None, Date:None</p>
<p>Seamustard and seatangle intake may effectively prevent colon and liver carcinogenesis by decreasing DNA damage and the mechanism of inhibiting carcinogenesis by seaweeds in a long term study are warranted.Citation: Journal:None, Date:None</p>
<p>We propose that the International Council for the Control of Iodine Deficient Disorders recommend that iodine intake be increased to at least 3â€‰mg/day of I2 in specific pathologies to obtain the potential extrathyroidal benefits described in the present review.Citation: Journal:None, Date:None</p>
<p>The present results suggest that seaweed consumption may be inversely associated with the prevalence of depressive symptoms during pregnancy in Japanese women.Citation: Journal:None, Date:None</p>
