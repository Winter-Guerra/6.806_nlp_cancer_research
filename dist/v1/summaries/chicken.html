<p>Versican G3 domain appears to be important in local and systemic tumor invasiveness of human breast cancer. Effects include enhancing cell viability, proliferation, migration and enhancing local tumor growth. Potential effects on angiogenesis include enhancing vascular endothelial proliferation, migration, and vessel formation. The interactions between tumor cells, surrounding stromal components and neo-vascularization in breast cancer may include interactions with VEGF and fibronectin. The propensity of versican G3 to influence tumor invasion to bone and the mechanisms of G3 mediated osteolysis warrants ongoing studies.Citation: Journal:None, Date:None</p>
<p>In this proof-of-principle study, the ESS results were comparable with current intraoperative diagnostic techniques of lymph node assessment.Copyright (c) 2010 British Journal of Surgery Society Ltd. Published by John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.Citation: Journal:None, Date:None</p>
<p>Secretions in breast cancer are seen in a range of lesions that include IDC, mucinous, and secretory carcinomas. The quantity and location of secretions in breast cancer offer clues to differentiating these.Citation: Journal:None, Date:None</p>
<p>Higher consumption of mutagens from meats cooked at higher temperature and longer duration was not associated with increased risk of postmenopausal breast cancer.Citation: Journal:None, Date:None</p>
<p>Overall, associations between breast cancer risk and consumption of red meat and poultry were of different magnitude in AA and Caucasian women, with further differences noted by menopausal and hormone receptor status in Caucasian women. This is the first study to examine racial differences in meat and breast cancer risk, and represents some of the first evidence in AA women.Citation: Journal:None, Date:None</p>
