<p>We document an unexpected effect of DIM on cell proliferation, which is to stimulate growth by inducing the ERα signaling pathway. Importantly, this proliferative effect of DIM happens with potentially physiological concentrations that can be provided by the diet or by taking caplet supplements.Citation: Journal:None, Date:None</p>
<p>Sulforaphane inhibits breast CSCs and down-regulates Wnt/β-catenin self-renewal pathway. These findings support the use of sulforaphane for chemoprevention of breast cancer stem cells and warrant further clinical evaluation.Citation: Journal:None, Date:None</p>
<p>I3C has specific antigrowth effects in human breast cancer cells. The inhibitory effects of I3C may involve selective induction of estradiol metabolism and the related cytochrome P-450 system that may be limited to estrogen-sensitive cells.Citation: Journal:None, Date:None</p>
