<p>These results, particularly that obtained in nontumorigenic/immortalized MCF10A cells, suggest that chemopreventive activity of cabbage against breast cancer observed in epidemiological studies may be partly explained by inhibition of the aromatase expression.Citation: Journal:None, Date:None</p>
<p>We document an unexpected effect of DIM on cell proliferation, which is to stimulate growth by inducing the ERÎ± signaling pathway. Importantly, this proliferative effect of DIM happens with potentially physiological concentrations that can be provided by the diet or by taking caplet supplements.Citation: Journal:None, Date:None</p>
<p>Our results provide the first evidence that a natural anti-cancer compound mediates its cellular and in vivo tumor anti-proliferative responses by selectively stimulating cellular interactions of the stem/progenitor cell marker nucleostemin with MDM2, which frees p53 to trigger its apoptotic response. Furthermore, our study provides a new mechanistic template that can potentially be exploited for the development of therapeutic strategies targeted at cancer stem/progenitor cells.Citation: Journal:None, Date:None</p>
