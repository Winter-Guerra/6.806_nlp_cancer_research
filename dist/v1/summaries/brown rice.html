<p>(1) Cancer is a worldwide problem. (2) A modification of diet and lifestyle could reduce morbidity and mortality. (3) Early detection through screening improves prognosis and reduces mortality.Citation: Journal:None, Date:None</p>
<p>GBR and its bioactives could be a potential alternative in improving reproductive system atrophy, dryness and discomfort during menopause.Citation: Journal:None, Date:None</p>
<p>GBR phenolics moderately regulate the expression of ER-β, HSP70, and IL-4 receptor genes, and gave a positive immunoreaction to ER-β antigen in the uterus. ASG regulates the expression of CaBP9k and IL-4 receptor genes, and ORZ regulates the expression of the CaBP9k gene, while GABA at 100 mg/kg regulates the expression of the HSP70 gene. GBR and its bioactives might have an effect on estrogen-regulated genes in the uterus of rats.Citation: Journal:None, Date:None</p>
<p>Taken together, our data suggested that brewers’ rice can inhibit cell proliferation, induce apoptosis, and suppress COX-2 and β-catenin expression via the Wnt signaling pathway and holds great promise in the field of chemoprevention as a dietary agent.Citation: Journal:None, Date:None</p>
<p>The results from this study show that dietary soluble fiber intake is associated with a significantly reduced risk of ER− breast cancer among pre-menopausal women. Additional studies with larger sample size are needed to confirm these results.Citation: Journal:None, Date:None</p>
