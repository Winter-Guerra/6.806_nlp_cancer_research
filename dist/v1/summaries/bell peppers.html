<p>Oral Capsol-TÂ® is well tolerated and, for ENOX2 presence in serum in the absence of clinical cancer symptoms, is consistently effective in reducing the serum ENOX2 levels to below detectable limits.Citation: Journal:None, Date:None</p>
<p>There are more similarities than differences in the dietary intake of Hispanic and non-Hispanic white breast cancer survivors in the Women's Healthy Eating and Living study. Further analysis is needed to determine if higher lycopene consumption shown among the Hispanic participants will translate to greater protection against breast cancer recurrence or increased survival.In the United States the risk of developing breast cancer differs significantly among women of different ethnicities or racial groups. The risk is highest for non-Hispanic white women, followed in decreasing frequency by African Americans, Asians, Pacific Islanders, Hispanics, American Indians, and Alaskan Natives (1,2). These differences may potentially be explained by culture and environmental factors, such as diet (3-13).Dietary studies have suggested that diets high in fruits and vegetables and low in alcohol and total and saturated fats may reduce the risk of breast cancer (4-8,11) and breast cancer recurrence (14-16). Among women with a high incidence of familial breast cancer, an inverse association between carotenoid-rich foods and breast cancer has been reported (6), and alcohol consumption has been associated with an increased risk of breast cancer (16,17), particularly among women with folate insufficient diets. One study designed to evaluate variations in nutrient intake among breast cancer patients demonstrated statistically significant ethnic variation in dietary intake between African-American, Chinese, Hispanic, Japanese and non-Hispanic white breast cancer female patients (18).To develop effective dietary intervention strategies for breast cancer survivors from different ethnicities or racial backgrounds, researchers must be familiar with the dietary patterns of the population they are targeting. Further, identifying significant differences in dietary patterns across ethnic groups may help to explain ethnic differences in breast cancer and breast cancer recurrence rates. To this end, before the study intervention, we evaluated the baseline reported dietary intake of the Hispanic breast cancer survivors and a subset of non-Hispanic white breast cancer survivors enrolled in a randomized controlled dietary intervention study.Citation: Journal:None, Date:None</p>
<p>Multiplicative, systematic biases are introduced at many stages of microarray experiments. When these are reconciled, raw data can be directly integrated from different gene expression datasets leading to new biological findings with increased statistical power.Citation: Journal:None, Date:None</p>
<p>The study demonstrated the anticancer activity of KLH acting through the induction of NK cells and inhibition of cancer cells. KLH, therefore, may be a good candidate for an anticancer agent alone or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents.Citation: Journal:None, Date:None</p>
<p>Taken together, these data shift our understanding of adjacent benign epithelial cells in the cancer process, from passive, noncontributory cells to an active and tumor-promoting vicinal cell population that may have significant effects early, when benign cells outnumber malignant cells.Citation: Journal:None, Date:None</p>
<p>Our data corroborate epidemiologic data, suggesting that the etiology and pathogenesis of breast cancers vary by ER status, which may have implications for developing prevention strategies for these tumors.Citation: Journal:None, Date:None</p>
<p>In this study we identified a list of food items which capture the variation in antioxidant intake among these women. The major contributors to dietary total antioxidant intake were coffee, tea, red wine, blueberries, walnuts, oranges, cinnamon and broccoli. These items should be assessed in as much detail as possible in studies that wish to capture the variation in antioxidant intake.Citation: Journal:None, Date:None</p>
<p>Human postpartum breast involution is a dominant tissue-remodeling process that returns the total lobular area of the gland to a level essentially indistinguishable from the nulliparous gland. Further research is warranted to determine whether the normal physiologic process of postpartum involution contributes to the poor prognosis of postpartum breast cancer.Citation: Journal:None, Date:None</p>
