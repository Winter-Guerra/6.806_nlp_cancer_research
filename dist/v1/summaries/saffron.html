<p>Results indicate a decrease in the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor in the treated samples with saffron extract compared to control. This reduction in VEGFR2 level induced by synergic treatment of saffron and EMF which reveals induction of inhibitory effects of saffron on angiogenesis and could be also considered as a promising chemotherapeutic agent in breast cancer treatment.Citation: Journal:None, Date:None</p>
<p>This is the first study showing the effect of saffron in HCT116 colorectal cancer cells with different p53 status. Saffron induced DNA-damage and apoptosis in both cell lines. However, autophagy has delayed the induction of apoptosis in HCT116 p53 −/− cells. Considering the fact that most tumors show a functional p53 inactivation, further research is needed to elucidate the long-term effects of saffron in p53 −/− tumors.Citation: Journal:None, Date:None</p>
<p>Our pre-clinical study demonstrated a neuroblastoma cell line to be highly sensitive to safranal-mediated growth inhibition and apoptotic cell death. Although the molecular mechanisms of safranal action are not yet clearly understood, it appears to have potential as a therapeutic agent.Citation: Journal:None, Date:None</p>
<p>Cloves are natural products with excellent cytotoxicity toward MCF-7 cells; thus, they are promising sources for the development of anticancer agents.Citation: Journal:None, Date:None</p>
<p>The DQI-R served as an effective guide and evaluation tool for this diet-related randomized controlled trial. Like many interventions, our effect diminished after the intervention was complete. Future research should consider testing interventions that use the DQI-R, or other global diet-related indexes, as guides and evaluation tools over longer study periods, as well as in other populations.Citation: Journal:None, Date:None</p>
<p>We also showed that even higher concentrations of saffron is safe for L929, but the extract exerts pro-apoptotic effects in a lung cancer-derived cell line and could be considered as a potential chemotherapeutic agent in lung cancer.Citation: Journal:None, Date:None</p>
<p>Ccrocetin is a potential anticancer agent, which may be used as a chemotherapeutic drug or as a chemosensitizer for vincristine.Citation: Journal:None, Date:None</p>
<p>The crab shell extract inhibited the proliferation of MCF7 cells by increasing apoptosis and decreasing NO production.Citation: Journal:None, Date:None</p>
<p>Data from this study demonstrated that Crocus sativus extract and its major constituent, crocin, significantly inhibited the growth of colorectal cancer cells while not affecting normal cells. Crocus sativus extract should be investigated further as a viable option in the treatment of colorectal cancer.Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer related-death and the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in the United States, with approximately 100,000 new cases diagnosed per year [1, 2]. If detected very early in the course of the disease, surgical resection may be adequate, but many patients still need supplemental chemotherapy or radiotherapy. In most cases, commonly used chemotherapies are limited by severe side effects and dose-limiting toxicity. Adding more drugs or increasing the dosages increases the probability of adverse effects. The drug-related adverse events not only worsen patients' quality of life, but can also lead to their refusal to continue the potentially curative chemotherapy [3]. Newer therapies involving targeted chemotherapy of metastatic colorectal cancer are also associated with undesirable adverse effects [4]. Considering these facts, significant improvement in treating patients with colorectal cancer is required.In the last two decades, botanicals with effective anti-cancer activity have been researched. The use of herbal medicines is also on the rise in cancer patients [5, 6]. Long-term consumption of certain botanicals could be associated with reduced cancer incidence and thus has an epidemiological basis for further investigation. Research that explores new botanical candidates with potential anti-cancer effects is imperative, and allows for the development of safe and efficacious anti-cancer therapies [7, 8].Crocus sativus is a plant of the iris family (Iridaceae) and its flower contains various chemical constituents [9]. Stigmas of the flower (saffron) contain crocin, anthocyanin, carotene and lycopene [10], and these constituents have various pharmacological effects on different illness, including anti-tumor effects by inhibition of cell growth [11]. Recently, Crocus sativus extract (CSE) was found to have anti-cancer activities against leukaemia, osteosarcoma, fibrosarcoma and ovarian carcinoma cells [9]. Crocin (Fig. 1) is a main constituent the CSE. However, effects of CSE and crocin on human colorectal cancer have not been evaluated.In this study, using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), we analyzed CSE and its content of crocin. The anti-proliferation effects of CSE and crocin were evaluated in three human colorectal cancer cell lines, i. e., HT-29, SW-480 and HCT-116. The inhibitory effects on colorectal cancer cell growth were also compared to a different cancer, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. Additionally, we also tested if CSE's anti-proliferative effects can bee seen in non-cancer young adult mouse colon (YAMC) cells.Citation: Journal:None, Date:None</p>
