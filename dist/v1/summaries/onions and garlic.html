<p>Our results showed that BMI, history of BBD biopsy, older AOM, SA and menopause were associated with increased risk of breast cancer among Chinese women. The findings derived from the study provided some suggestions for population-based prevention and control of breast cancer in China.Citation: Journal:None, Date:None</p>
<p>Our study established a hyperlipidemia colon tumor model involving subcutaneous colon translocation and orthotopic transplantation, this model was an ideal research model for mutual influence of hyperlipidemia and colorectal cancer. Onion’s extraction could inhibit the proliferation of colorectal cancer; the function of the high-dose of onion’s extraction was fairly to capecitabine, which provided a new direction in protecting and treating colorectal cancer.Citation: Journal:None, Date:None</p>
<p>It is of interest that the extract of this plant has shown much less cytotoxicity against the normal cell line, and, if this also occurs in vivo, the use of this plant clinically for the treatment of cancer patients would have some scientific support. The results of these assays indicated that A. ascalonicum can be a candidate for prevention and treatment of many diseases related to inflammation and malignancy.Citation: Journal:None, Date:None</p>
<p>Our results suggest that high intake of total vegetables, certain fruits, milk, and eggs may reduce the risk of breast cancer, while high consumption of animal-source foods may increase risk. The dietary associations did not appear to vary by ER/PR status.Citation: Journal:None, Date:None</p>
