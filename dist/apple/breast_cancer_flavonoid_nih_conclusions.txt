---
the present study suggests the intake of flavonols and flavones but not other flavonoid subclasses or total flavonoids is associated with a decreased risk of breast cancer especially among postmenopausal women
----
the inverse association of flavan3ol intake with er but not er breast cancer is consistent with other studies that suggest a beneficial role of plantbased diets in er breast cancer risk

----
based on results from the semibayesian model breast cancer risk may be influenced jointly by flavonoid intake and genes involved in dna repair but our findings require confirmation
----
the additive effects of multiple flavonoids for bcrp inhibition suggests that prediction of bcrpmediated food herbal productdrug interactions should also take into consideration the presence of multiple flavonoids and provides a rationale for using flavonoid cocktails as a potential approach for multidrug resistance reversal in cancer treatment
----
we have shown that apigenin is an effective proteasome inhibitor in cultured breast cancer cells and in breast cancer xenografts furthermore apigenin induces apoptotic cell death in human breast cancer cells and exhibits anticancer activities in tumors the results suggest its potential benefits in breast cancer prevention and treatment
----
that several flavonoids may significantly block production of this androgenregulated protein it will be worthwhile to examine these compounds as possible candidates for prostate cancer prevention or management
