----
These results support the accumulating evidence that consumption of meats cooked by methods that promote carcinogen formation may increase risk of postmenopausal breast cancer.
----
Higher consumption of mutagens from meats cooked at higher temperature and longer duration was not associated with increased risk of postmenopausal breast cancer.
----
In this prospective study, red meat, MeIQx, and dietary iron elevated the risk of invasive breast cancer, but there was no linear trend in the association except for dietary iron.
----
Evidence of the role of meat intake in breast cancer is mixed. There are conflicting findings from a pooled analysis of cohort studies (Missmer et al, 2002), and a meta-analysis of cohort and case–control studies (Boyd et al, 2003), yet several recent studies indicate that meat may increase the risk of postmenopausal breast cancer (Shannon et al, 2003; Steck et al, 2007; Taylor et al, 2007; Egeberg et al, 2008; Hu et al, 2008); meat-related exposures potentially involved, however, have not been well studied.
----
Meat mutagens, such as heterocyclic amines (HCAs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), are formed in meat cooked to well done at high temperatures (Sinha et al, 2005). Haem iron, found mainly in red meat, is more bioavailable than non-haem iron and, although iron homoeostasis is tightly controlled, haem iron absorption is less well regulated (Carpenter and Mahoney, 1992). Meat mutagens induce (el-Bayoumy et al, 1995; Snyderwine et al, 2002) and iron promotes (Thompson et al, 1991; Diwan et al, 1997) mammary carcinogenesis in rodent studies. Iron may also be involved in breast cancer through interaction with catechol oestrogen metabolites or production of hydroxyl radicals (Liehr and Jones, 2001; Huang, 2003; Kabat and Rohan, 2007). Limited epidemiological studies of meat mutagens (De Stefani et al, 1997; Delfino et al, 2000; Sinha et al, 2000; Steck et al, 2007; Sonestedt et al, 2008; Kabat et al, 2009; Mignone et al, 2009) and haem iron (Lee et al, 2004; Kabat et al, 2007) are inconsistent.

We used unique databases and a detailed meat questionnaire to comprehensively assess meat intake and potentially carcinogenic meat-related exposures in relation to postmenopausal invasive breast cancer in the prospective Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial.
----
In this prospective study, red meat, MeIQx, and dietary iron elevated the risk of invasive breast cancer, but there was no linear trend in the association except for dietary iron.
----
BaP intake, a PAH in barbecued meat, was positively associated with RCC. These biologically plausible findings advocate further epidemiological investigation into dietary intake of BaP and risk of RCC.
----
Renal cell carcinoma (RCC), the most common kidney neoplasm in adults, originates in the lining of the proximal convoluted tubule, where glucose, amino acids, uric acid, and inorganic salts are reabsorbed into the filtrate (Barjorin, 2007). Renal cell carcinoma is more common in men than women, and the rates remain higher in African Americans (Chow et al, 2010; Jemal et al, 2010). Despite associations with diet-related chronic conditions, such as obesity, hypertension, and diabetes, dietary risk factors for RCC are not well established (World Cancer Research Fund/American Institute for Cancer Research, 2007; Chow et al, 2010). Intake of fruits and vegetables may lower RCC risk (Rashidkhani et al, 2005; Lee et al, 2006), whereas high meat intake may increase risk (Faramawi et al, 2007; Aune et al, 2009; Dolwick Grieb et al, 2009), but the epidemiological evidence for various aspects of diet is largely inconsistent.
----
Cooking of meat at high temperatures may result in the formation and ingestion of carcinogenic compounds, including heterocyclic amines (HCAs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) (Rothman et al, 1993; Phillips, 1999; Sinha and Norat, 2002). Heterocyclic amines, the pyrolysis products of amino acids and creatine/creatinine, are formed in the meat's fatty juices upon direct contact with a high-heat cooking surface, such as during pan-frying (Sinha et al, 1998). Meat cooked above an open flame or embers, as with barbecuing or grilling, contains the highest levels of PAHs in the smoke formed as the meat's fatty juices drip onto the heat source (Kazerouni et al, 2001).
----
Dietary intake of HCAs and benzo(a)pyrene (BaP), a PAH found in the diet (Rothman et al, 1993; Kazerouni et al, 2001), have been linked to tumour formation at multiple organ sites in animal feeding studies (Nagao and Sugimura, 1993; Sinha and Norat, 2002). These compounds have also been associated with cancers of the colorectum (Sinha et al, 2005b; Cross et al, 2010), lung (Lam et al, 2009; Tasevska et al, 2009), pancreas (Anderson et al, 2005; Stolzenberg-Solomon et al, 2007), prostate (Cross et al, 2005), and breast (Sinha et al, 2000) in several large epidemiological investigations; however, results across studies and cancer sites are not consistent (Alaejos et al, 2008; Mignone et al, 2009; Tasevska et al, 2010; Wu et al, 2010). Despite the kidneys' role in metabolism and urinary excretion of these compounds (Turteltaub et al, 1997; Peters et al, 2004), human investigations of meat mutagens and kidney cancer are sparse and limited by small numbers of cases (Lindblad et al, 1997; De Stefani et al, 1998; Augustsson et al, 1999), narrow range of intake (Augustsson et al, 1999), and/or lack of comprehensive assessments of cooking methods and doneness to calculate the levels of potential meat-cooking carcinogens (Wolk et al, 1996; Lindblad et al, 1997). We investigated intake of meat and meat-related mutagens in relation to RCC in a large, population-based case–control study of US men and women who completed a Diet History Questionnaire (DHQ) with a meat-cooking module. We also examined whether these associations varied by race, gender, or smoking status.
----
Overall, associations between breast cancer risk and consumption of red meat and poultry were of different magnitude in AA and Caucasian women, with further differences noted by menopausal and hormone receptor status in Caucasian women. This is the first study to examine racial differences in meat and breast cancer risk, and represents some of the first evidence in AA women.
----
This analysis of African-American women provides little support for associations of dairy and meat intake with breast cancer risk.
