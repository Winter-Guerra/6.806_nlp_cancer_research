    Our results suggest that high intake of total vegetables, certain fruits, milk, and eggs may reduce the risk of breast cancer, while high consumption of animal-source foods may increase risk. The dietary associations did not appear to vary by ER/PR status.

    Our study provides additional support for the hypothesis that a dietary pattern rich in fruit and salad might protect against invasive breast cancer and that the effect might be stronger for ER- and PR-negative tumours. Most of the studies on the risk of breast cancer in relation to individual foods and nutrients have had inconsistent results (Michels et al, 2007). Dietary pattern analysis is an increasingly common alternative approach for examining the relationship between diet and the risk of disease or biomarkers of disease (Newby and Tucker, 2004). Factor analysis applied to dietary data produces a few patterns of dietary intake that represent underlying independent dimensions of food and nutrient consumption. The assessment of dietary patterns in this way overcomes limitations of the single food or nutrient approach (Newby and Tucker, 2004). Two recent systematic literature reviews (Edefonti et al, 2009; Brennan et al, 2010) found consistent evidence that a ‘prudent&#x27;/‘healthy&#x27; dietary pattern was associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer. Breast cancer, similar to most cancers, is heterogeneous in its pathology, natural history and response to treatment. Breast cancer differ, for example, with respect to oestrogen (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) status; hormone receptor-positive cancers exhibiting better differentiated morphological appearance and stronger clinical response to hormonal treatment (Althuis et al, 2004). There is evidence to suggest that risk factors (Colditz et al, 2004), including food items (Olsen et al, 2003; Stripp et al, 2003; Suzuki et al, 2005; Zhang et al, 2005; Cho et al, 2006) and dietary patterns (Fung et al, 2005; Velie et al, 2005; Agurs-Collins et al, 2009) differ in their association by tumour receptor status. Using data from the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study (MCCS), we analyze the effect of dietary patterns on breast cancer risk overall, by attained age during follow-up and by tumour characteristics, including tumour grade and ER and PR status.

    This comprehensive prospective analysis suggests women with higher circulating levels of α-carotene, β-carotene, lutein+zeaxanthin, lycopene, and total carotenoids may be at reduced risk of breast cancer. Carotenoids, natural pigments ranging from yellow to red, are important for photosynthesis in plants. More than 600 carotenoids have been identified (1), approximately 40 are present in the US diet, 20 of which are measurable in tissue and serum. α-Carotene, β-carotene, β-cryptoxanthin, lutein, zeaxanthin, and lycopene are the most prevalent, comprising 90% of circulating carotenoids (1–3). These micronutrients are suspected to be anticarcinogenic, with possible biologic activities including antioxidation, enhanced gap-junction intercellular communication, immunoenhancement, inhibition of tumorigenesis and malignant transformation, and metabolism to retinoids, which, in turn, contribute to cellular differentiation (4–10). Experimental studies suggest carotenoids inhibit tumor progression and reduce proliferation in both estrogen receptor positive (ER+) and ER− breast cancer cells (11). Studies of dietary intake, of fruits and vegetables overall and carotenoids specifically, have had mixed results, although a modest inverse association has been suggested in several studies, as summarized in meta-analyses and pooled analyses (12–14). Several (15–19), but not all (20), studies of dietary patterns that include higher fruit and vegetable intake observed lower risk of ER−, but not ER+, breast tumors. Most recently, in pooled analyses of 18 cohort studies, stronger inverse associations were observed for ER− (vs ER+) tumors with intake of fruits and vegetables (S Y Jung, D Spiegelman, L Baglietto, et al., unpublished data) as well as intake of α-carotene, β-carotene, and lutein+zeaxanthin (21). Examining circulating carotenoid levels overcomes potential weaknesses of dietary data, including recall of past diet (3), inaccuracies of nutrient databases to determine carotenoid content of specific foods (22), influences of cooking and storage on carotenoid content (3,23), geographic and seasonal variation of foods (22), and individual differences in nutrient absorption. As a result of these limitations, the correlations between intake and plasma carotenoid levels are modest (r = 0.2–0.4) (24,25). Over the last 13 years, 10 prospective studies have investigated the associations between circulating carotenoids and breast cancer risk (26–35), eight of which are included in this analysis (26–33). Most studies observed inverse associations, either suggested or statistically significant, with at least one of five carotenoids (α-carotene, β-carotene, β-cryptoxanthin, lutein+zeaxanthin, lycopene), although the specific carotenoid and/or subgroup of importance varied among studies. The collaborating investigators of eight studies conducted a pooled analysis of original data examining associations between circulating carotenoids and breast cancer risk, the results of which are presented here.

    High dietary intakes of plant lignans and high exposure to enterolignans were associated with reduced risks of ER- and PR-positive postmenopausal breast cancer in a Western population that does not consume a diet rich in soy. Phytoestrogens are naturally occurring compounds that are found in plants and in most foods of plant origin. Phytoestrogens consist mainly of isoflavones, which are found in high concentrations in soy and legumes, and lignans, which are found in a variety of fruits, vegetables, and cereal products. Because phytoestrogens have a chemical structure that is similar to that of 17 β-estradiol, they may compete with estrogens for binding to estrogen receptors (ERs) and in so doing, may act as weak estrogen agonists or antagonists (1). Therefore, phytoestrogens have been hypothesized to behave like selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) and to play a role in the chemoprevention of breast cancer (1). However, despite 15 years of epidemiologic research, the possible association between dietary intake of phytoestrogens and the risk of breast cancer remains unclear. Initially, results from international comparisons and studies of migrant populations gave rise to the hypothesis that higher intakes of soy, a primary source of isoflavones, might be associated with a decreased risk of breast cancer (2, 3). Subsequent case–control and cohort studies (4) conducted in Asia generally confirmed that a high consumption of soy-based foods and isoflavones is associated with a lower risk of premenopausal breast cancer, especially if exposure occurs early in life, for instance, during adolescence. However, studies conducted in North America and Europe have been less conclusive than the Asian studies (4). Indeed, they were inconsistent with each other in showing an association between Western intake levels ofisofl avones and breast cancer risk, but they suggested a possibly reduced risk of breast cancer associated with lignan intakes (5, 6). Moreover, limited evidence is available on exposure to the bioactive metabolites of lignans, the enterolignans, which derive from the metabolism of ingested lignans by the gut microflora and are absorbed by the intestinal cells into the circulation (7). To date, 10 biomarker studies (six prospective studies and four case–control studies) have investigated the relationship between circulating or excreted levels of enterolignans and the risk of postmenopausal breast cancer. Among the prospective studies, five (8–12) found no association and one (6) found that a higher plasma level of enterolignans was associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer. The four case–control studies showed a statistically significant inverse association (13–15) or a suggestive trend for an inverse association (16) between higher serum or urinary levels of enterolignans and the risk of postmenopausal breast cancer. Large prospective studies of dietary lignan intake in relation to breast cancer risk are still scarce, and further research is needed to clarify the potential associations of lignans and enterolignans with breast cancer risk.
