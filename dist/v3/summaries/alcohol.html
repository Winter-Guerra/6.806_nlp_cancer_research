<h1>Alcohol and its effects on breast cancer</h1>

<ul id="knowledge-list">

    Alcohol use may be more strongly associated with risk of hormone-sensitive breast cancers than hormone-insensitive subtypes, suggesting distinct etiologic pathways for these two breast cancer subtypes.

    We found that the relative risk of breast cancer in men is comparable to that in women for alcohol intakes below 60 g per day. It continues to increase at high consumption levels not usually studied in women. Copyright 2004 Kluwer Academic Publishers

    Taking account of shortcomings in the study base and methodological concerns, we confirm the alcoholâ€“breast cancer association. We compared our results to those of an individual patient data analysis, with similar findings. We conclude that the association between alcohol and breast cancer may be causal.
