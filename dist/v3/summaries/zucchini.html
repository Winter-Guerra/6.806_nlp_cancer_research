    The results from this study show that dietary soluble fiber intake is associated with a significantly reduced risk of ER− breast cancer among pre-menopausal women. Additional studies with larger sample size are needed to confirm these results.

    The study revealed that the risk factors for breast cancer among women in the Tabriz area of Iran are related to the lifestyle. Therefore, the provision of education to change unhealthy lifestyle choices and periodic check-ups for early breast cancer detection are recommended.

    Exemestane lacks the beneficial effect of tamoxifen on lipids; however, sequential adjuvant treatment with exemestane in postmenopausal breast cancer patients after cessation of 5 to 7 years of tamoxifen does not appear to alter the lipid profile significantly compared with that of an observational arm.

    We provide evidence that Luminal breast cancer cells can be targeted by the PDGF signaling pathway leading to estrogen-independent proliferation and angiogenesis. We speculate that stroma-directed therapies, including anti-PDGFR agents like Imatinib, may be useful in combination with other therapies for treatment of luminal cancers.

    Additional, prospective studies are needed to validate and confirm the changes in cognitive function associated with hormone therapy for breast cancer. Adjuvant therapy regimens for breast cancer that modify hormone action have significantly improved the cure rate for women with early-stage disease, but their use is associated with several negative sequelae, including cognitive impairment.1,2 Results of our work suggest that cognitive impairment is more severe and affects more memory domains in women who receive tamoxifen as part of their therapy regimen compared with women with breast cancer who receive chemotherapy alone or no adjuvant therapy.3 Tamoxifen is a mixed estrogen agonist/antagonist that alters hormone action by binding to estrogen receptors and blocking endogenous estrogen action. The impact of this partial blocking may contribute to cognitive impairment. Agents such as the aromatase inhibitor anastrozole are replacing tamoxifen for the treatment of postmenopausal women with hormone receptor–positive, early-stage breast cancer.4-6 Plasma estrogen levels are significantly lower in women with early-stage disease who receive anastrozole compared with those who receive tamoxifen.7 Because estrogen action has been implicated as a modulator of cognitive function,8 we hypothesized that anastrozole may have a more profound effect on cognitive function than tamoxifen. To test this hypothesis we conducted a pilot study to compare cognitive function in women with early-stage breast cancer who receive tamoxifen with cognitive function in those who receive anastrozole.

    In premenopausal women with hormone-receptor–positive early breast cancer, adjuvant treatment with exemestane plus ovarian suppression, as compared with tamoxifen plus ovarian suppression, significantly reduced recurrence. (Funded by Pfizer and others; TEXT and SOFT ClinicalTrials.gov numbers, NCT00066703 and NCT00066690, respectively.) The most effective adjuvant endocrine therapy for premenopausal women with hormone-receptor (estrogen, progesterone, or both)–positive breast cancer is uncertain. Tamoxifen for at least 5 years is a standard of care.1–3 Adjuvant suppression of ovarian function (hereafter, ovarian suppression) may be recommended in addition. For postmenopausal women, adjuvant therapy with an aromatase inhibitor, as compared with tamoxifen, improves outcomes.2–9 In 2003, the International Breast Cancer Study Group (IBCSG) initiated two randomized, phase 3 trials, the Tamoxifen and Exemestane Trial (TEXT) and the Suppression of Ovarian Function Trial (SOFT), involving premenopausal women with hormone-receptor–positive early breast cancer, through collaboration with the Breast International Group (BIG) and the North American Breast Cancer Group. The trials were designed to determine whether adjuvant therapy with the aromatase inhibitor exemestane improved disease-free survival, as compared with tamoxifen, among pre-menopausal women treated plus ovarian suppression and to determine the value of ovarian suppression in women who were suitable candidates for treatment with adjuvant tamoxifen. Here we report the results of the planned10 primary combined analysis of data from TEXT and SOFT comparing adjuvant exemestane plus ovarian suppression with adjuvant tamoxifen plus ovarian suppression after a median follow-up of 68 months.
