    High folate intake was associated with decreased breast cancer risk. Vitamin B12 intake may modify this association.

    A diet characterized by a low P/S ratio seems to be more important for the development of breast cancer than total fat intake.

    Although RRR may be useful in studies of diet and disease, our results suggest that RRR dietary patterns based on GI and GL provide similar information regarding the association between breast cancer, GI, and GL.

    These results suggest that the manner in which fruits and vegetables are grouped provides different plasma nutrient exposure information, which may be an important consideration when testing and generating hypotheses regarding disease risk in relation to diet. Interview season should be considered when evaluating associations of reported intake and plasma nutrients with disease outcomes.

    The role of vitamin supplements in preventing breast cancer still remains unclear, considering our review. Although biologic mechanisms exist to support the anticancer effects of vitamins, there is no clear evidence for an effect in cancer prevention for vitamin supplements. Further investigations are warranted to elucidate the mechanisms by which vitamin supplementation can modify breast cancer development.

    The lymphedema experiences of breast cancer survivors reveal perceptions of marginalization from healthcare providers who are not well informed about lymphedema management and minimize its impact. Multiple distressing losses confront these patients on a daily basis, including body image disturbances, loss of functionality and control over time, permanent uncertainty, and adverse effects on relationships. The daily challenges of lymphedema often result in cumulative frustration and resentment that contribute to failure to perform self-care. Normalcy has been lost, never to return. These women find solace, encouragement and hope to meet the challenges of lymphedema through support from others and their spiritual beliefs.

    Our study provides additional support for the hypothesis that a dietary pattern rich in fruit and salad might protect against invasive breast cancer and that the effect might be stronger for ER- and PR-negative tumours. Most of the studies on the risk of breast cancer in relation to individual foods and nutrients have had inconsistent results (Michels et al, 2007). Dietary pattern analysis is an increasingly common alternative approach for examining the relationship between diet and the risk of disease or biomarkers of disease (Newby and Tucker, 2004). Factor analysis applied to dietary data produces a few patterns of dietary intake that represent underlying independent dimensions of food and nutrient consumption. The assessment of dietary patterns in this way overcomes limitations of the single food or nutrient approach (Newby and Tucker, 2004). Two recent systematic literature reviews (Edefonti et al, 2009; Brennan et al, 2010) found consistent evidence that a ‘prudent&#x27;/‘healthy&#x27; dietary pattern was associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer. Breast cancer, similar to most cancers, is heterogeneous in its pathology, natural history and response to treatment. Breast cancer differ, for example, with respect to oestrogen (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) status; hormone receptor-positive cancers exhibiting better differentiated morphological appearance and stronger clinical response to hormonal treatment (Althuis et al, 2004). There is evidence to suggest that risk factors (Colditz et al, 2004), including food items (Olsen et al, 2003; Stripp et al, 2003; Suzuki et al, 2005; Zhang et al, 2005; Cho et al, 2006) and dietary patterns (Fung et al, 2005; Velie et al, 2005; Agurs-Collins et al, 2009) differ in their association by tumour receptor status. Using data from the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study (MCCS), we analyze the effect of dietary patterns on breast cancer risk overall, by attained age during follow-up and by tumour characteristics, including tumour grade and ER and PR status.

    Our findings do not support an inverse association between choline intake and risk of colorectal adenoma. The positive association between choline intake and colorectal adenoma that we observed could represent effects of other components in the foods from which choline was derived and should be investigated further. Choline and its oxidation product betaine are nutrients involved in one-carbon metabolism (1,2). Either folate (5-methyltetrahydrofolate) or betaine can donate a methyl group to homocysteine to create methionine. Methylation of homocysteine by betaine is confined to the liver and the kidney, but the pathway involving folate exists in all body cells (3). In addition to being methyl-group donors, choline and betaine have other biologic functions. Choline is a precursor for the cell membrane phospholipids phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin (1,4) and for the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, and it is essential in brain development and normal memory function (5–8). Prolonged reduction in choline intake promotes fatty liver, DNA hypomethylation, and tumor development in the liver (even in the absence of carcinogens) in animals (9–11). Betaine is an osmolyte that regulates cellular hydration and cell volume and, thus, protects the cell from environmental stress (2). Organ meats, eggs, and wheat germ are rich dietary sources of choline (12); wheat germ or bran, spinach, and shellfish are rich dietary sources of betaine. Epidemiologic studies have found that intakes of dietary factors affecting one-carbon metabolism—lower folate, higher alcohol, and lower methionine—are associated with risk of colorectal adenoma (13,14). To our knowledge, however, there has been no epidemiologic study of the association of dietary choline and betaine with the risk of chronic diseases, including colorectal adenoma. The lack of such a study may be due in part to the fact that a food composition database for choline and betaine has not been available until recently (12). A few epidemiologic studies have examined the association of low choline and betaine intakes with risk of birth defects that had previously been associated with variations in one-carbon metabolism (15,16). We recently found that choline and betaine intake predicted plasma homocysteine levels independent of folate intake, confirming a biologic role of choline and betaine as methyl-group donors (17). In light of these findings, we examined the relationships between intakes of choline and betaine and the risk of colorectal adenoma among women in the Nurses&#x27; Health Study (18).
