<h1>Cabbage and its effects on breast cancer</h1>

    These results, particularly that obtained in nontumorigenic/immortalized MCF10A cells, suggest that chemopreventive activity of cabbage against breast cancer observed in epidemiological studies may be partly explained by inhibition of the aromatase expression.

    We document an unexpected effect of DIM on cell proliferation, which is to stimulate
         growth by inducing the ERα signaling pathway. Importantly, this proliferative effect
         of DIM happens with potentially physiological concentrations that can be provided
         by the diet or by taking caplet supplements.

    Our results provide the first evidence that a natural anti-cancer compound mediates
         its cellular and in vivo tumor anti-proliferative responses by selectively stimulating cellular interactions
         of the stem/progenitor cell marker nucleostemin with MDM2, which frees p53 to trigger
         its apoptotic response. Furthermore, our study provides a new mechanistic template
         that can potentially be exploited for the development of therapeutic strategies targeted
         at cancer stem/progenitor cells.
