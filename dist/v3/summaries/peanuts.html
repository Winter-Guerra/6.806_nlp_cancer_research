<h1>Peanuts and its effects on breast cancer</h1>

    Although RRR may be useful in studies of diet and disease, our results suggest that RRR dietary patterns based on GI and GL provide similar information regarding the association between breast cancer, GI, and GL.

    Dietary fiber, vegetable protein, vegetable fat, and nuts consumed during adolescence were associated with reduced breast cancer risk. It is increasingly recognized that early-life exposures can influence a lifetime risk of breast cancer [1–4]. Breast cancer risk accumulates across the life course with the highest rate of increase from menarche to first pregnancy [5–8]. Both human and animal data have demonstrated that environmental exposures during preadolescence, adolescence and early adulthood are more important in breast cancer development than exposures later in life [2, 4, 9–13]. There may be a critical period of increased biologic vulnerability from menarche, when breast tissue undergoes rapid proliferation, until the completion of the first pregnancy, when multiple physiologic changes in the breast occur and render epithelial cells less susceptible to malignant transformation [13–17]. This is well exemplified by the observed higher risk of breast cancer among female atomic bomb survivors in Hiroshima and Nagasaki who were less than 20 years old at the time of bombing [2]. Although the role of adolescent exposures in the etiology of breast cancer is increasingly evident, few epidemiologic studies have assessed the associations between adolescent diet and breast cancer risk. Among women in the Nurses’ Health Study (NHS) and the Nurses’ Health Study II (NHSII), two separate cohorts of US female nurses, adolescent vegetable fat intake was associated with a significant reduction in breast cancer risk, and adolescent dietary fiber intake was related to a non-significant decreased risk [18, 19], though these analyses were controlled for benign breast disease (BBD) which might be on the etiologic pathway [20, 21]. In addition, dietary fiber, vegetable fat, vegetable protein, and nuts consumed during adolescence have been inversely related to risk of proliferative BBD [20–22] among the participants in the NHSII and their daughters. It remains unclear if the results are specific to these populations with similar characteristics or applicable to a diverse population of women. Although adolescent soy food and/or soy protein intake has been associated with significantly reduced risk of breast cancer [4, 10], vegetable protein intake per se during adolescence in relation to adult breast cancer risk has not been evaluated. We, therefore, examined the associations of dietary fiber, vegetable protein, vegetable fat, and nuts consumed in adolescent years with risk of breast cancer in a large, population-based case-control study. We also evaluated the associations by menopausal status, adult body mass index (BMI), and family history of breast cancer at cancer diagnosis.
