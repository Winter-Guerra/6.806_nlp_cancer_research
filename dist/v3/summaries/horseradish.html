<h1>Horseradish and its effects on breast cancer</h1>

    Rapid mER-α-mediated nongenomic signaling cascades generate cAMP and downstream signaling events, which contribute to the regulation of breast cancer cell number.

    Low ATM protein expression in both malignant tumor and stromal compartments likely contributes to the aggressive nature of breast cancer and is an independent prognostic factor associated with worse survival in HNBC patients.

    The method of measuring Ki-67 expression by DAB staining combined with optical enhancement filters and quantification via computer-assisted image analysis techniques produced objective and reproducible results. As such, this method can offer (1) less intraobserver and interobserver variability, (2) a digital archival record, and (3) a baseline for digital exchange of information between studies.

    We have developed a protocol that allows simultaneous visualization of the HER2 IHC
         and HER2 &amp; CEN17 BISH targets. This automated protocol facilitated the determination of HER2
         protein and HER2 gene status in randomly selected breast cancer samples, particularly in cases that
         were equivocal or exhibited tumor heterogeneity. The HER2 gene-protein assay produced
         results virtually equivalent to those of the single FDA-approved HER2 IHC and HER2 &amp; CEN17 BISH assays.
