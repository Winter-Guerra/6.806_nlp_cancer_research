    Increased soy protein intake may lead to small, but significant, increases in IGF-1 and IGFBP-3. Soy consumption also led to a significant decrease in SHBG, which has been hypothesized to promote, rather than prevent, cancer growth. Previous epidemiological studies, however, have confirmed soy’s protective effect on breast cancer. Additional investigation regarding the effect of soy on breast cancer risk and its mechanism of action appears warranted.

    Our findings show the capacity of lycopene to inhibit cell proliferation, arrest cell cycle in different phases and increase apoptosis, mainly in breast, colon and prostate lines after 96 h. These observations suggest that lycopene may alter cell cycle regulatory proteins depending on the type of cancer and the dose of lycopene administration. Taken together, these data indicated that the antiproliferative effect of lycopene was cellular type, time and dose-dependent.

    There are more similarities than differences in the dietary intake of Hispanic and non-Hispanic white breast cancer survivors in the Women&#x27;s Healthy Eating and Living study. Further analysis is needed to determine if higher lycopene consumption shown among the Hispanic participants will translate to greater protection against breast cancer recurrence or increased survival. In the United States the risk of developing breast cancer differs significantly among women of different ethnicities or racial groups. The risk is highest for non-Hispanic white women, followed in decreasing frequency by African Americans, Asians, Pacific Islanders, Hispanics, American Indians, and Alaskan Natives (1,2). These differences may potentially be explained by culture and environmental factors, such as diet (3-13). Dietary studies have suggested that diets high in fruits and vegetables and low in alcohol and total and saturated fats may reduce the risk of breast cancer (4-8,11) and breast cancer recurrence (14-16). Among women with a high incidence of familial breast cancer, an inverse association between carotenoid-rich foods and breast cancer has been reported (6), and alcohol consumption has been associated with an increased risk of breast cancer (16,17), particularly among women with folate insufficient diets. One study designed to evaluate variations in nutrient intake among breast cancer patients demonstrated statistically significant ethnic variation in dietary intake between African-American, Chinese, Hispanic, Japanese and non-Hispanic white breast cancer female patients (18). To develop effective dietary intervention strategies for breast cancer survivors from different ethnicities or racial backgrounds, researchers must be familiar with the dietary patterns of the population they are targeting. Further, identifying significant differences in dietary patterns across ethnic groups may help to explain ethnic differences in breast cancer and breast cancer recurrence rates. To this end, before the study intervention, we evaluated the baseline reported dietary intake of the Hispanic breast cancer survivors and a subset of non-Hispanic white breast cancer survivors enrolled in a randomized controlled dietary intervention study.

    Increasing dietary consumption of tomato-based foods may beneficially increase serum adiponectin concentrations among postmenopausal women at increased breast cancer risk, especially those who are not obese. Additional studies are essential to confirm these effects and to elucidate the specific mechanisms that may make phytonutrients found in tomatoes practical as breast cancer chemopreventive agents. Breast cancer risk among postmenopausal women increases as body mass index (BMI) increases (1,–3). The relationship between obesity and breast cancer may be partially explained by the biological effects of the obesity-related adipokines, adiponectin and leptin, which are produced in and secreted from adipocytes including those in the breast (4). Studies have demonstrated an inverse association between circulating adiponectin and breast cancer risk overall (5,–8) and particularly among postmenopausal women (6, 8). Other studies have demonstrated a positive association between circulating leptin and breast cancer risk among postmenopausal women (5, 9, 10). Currently postmenopausal women, who are all at risk of developing breast cancer, lack practical preventive methods to reduce their risk. One potential strategy could be through dietary modifications. Studies have investigated specific dietary patterns, yet few have examined the effects of tomato- and soy-enriched diets on anthropometrics and circulating adipokine concentrations and if these dietary changes could translate into significant modalities for breast cancer prevention (11, 12). Lycopene, the predominant carotenoid in tomatoes, is a potent antioxidant relative to other carotenoids (13). Experimental and animal studies have shown that lycopene inhibits the growth of breast cancer cells and mammary tumorigenesis (14, 15). Additionally, lycopene has been shown to suppress biomarkers of cellular proliferation, including some proinflammatory cytokines, and alter adipocyte function (16), which may be associated with postmenopausal breast cancer risk. Some epidemiological studies have indicated that higher lycopene consumption is associated with reduced cancer risk (17, 18), but data for breast cancer have been mixed. A meta-analysis (19) of 15 studies examining the association between lycopene and breast cancer demonstrated no association [relative risk (RR) 0.99, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93–1.06]. Although studies have found that lycopene positively modulates cytokine-driven pathways, lycopene may not be able to overcome the effects of certain stressors such as obesity (20). Attention has also turned toward soy-based foods as chemopreventive agents. The typical Asian diet consists of fairly large amounts of soy, which is thought to be related to the lower breast cancer incidence among Asian women compared with their counterparts in the United States (21). It is hypothesized that the high content of isoflavones, particularly daidzein and genistein, contribute to the protective effects of soy. Isoflavones are polyphenolic phytonutrients capable of exerting both estrogenic and antiestrogenic effects (22), possibly contributing to increased and decreased risk of breast cancer, respectively. Results of epidemiological studies of the association between soy consumption and breast cancer have been mixed (23). A meta-analysis (23) of 14 studies examining the association between dietary isoflavone intake and breast cancer incidence demonstrated a modest reduction among high isoflavone consumers compared with those with the lowest consumption. Subgroup analysis revealed that risk reduction was significant in Asian, but not Western, women. This study also demonstrated that isoflavone intake was associated with lower breast cancer risk among postmenopausal but not premenopausal women (23). To our knowledge, no studies have examined the effect of isoflavone intake on adipokine concentrations among postmenopausal women who are at increased breast cancer risk. Although the initial feasibility study was designed to determine whether women at increased breast cancer risk would be willing to adhere to the proposed dietary interventions, we also assessed the effects of these lycopene-rich and/or isoflavone-rich dietary modifications on circulating biomarkers of cell signaling in postmenopausal women at high risk of developing breast cancer (24). For the present study, we sought to examine the effects of these interventions on biomarkers of obesity, specifically serum adiponectin, leptin, and the adiponectin to leptin (A/L) ratio.
