<h1>Basil and its effects on breast cancer</h1>

    The basal cellâ€“like molecular breast cancer subtype is an independent predictor of distant metastasis in African American women.

    These results suggest that risk estimates associated with mammographic density are
         not distinct for separate breast cancer subtypes (basal-like/triple negative vs. luminal
         A breast cancers). Studies with a larger number of basal-like breast cancers are needed
         to confirm our findings.

    Triple-negative tumors are synonymous with basal-like tumors, and can be identified
         by immunohistochemistry. Based on gene-expression profiling, basal-like tumors are
         still heterogeneous and can be subdivided into at least five distinct subgroups. The
         development of distant metastasis in basal-like tumors is associated with the presence
         of central fibrosis and a small amount of lymphocytic infiltrate.
