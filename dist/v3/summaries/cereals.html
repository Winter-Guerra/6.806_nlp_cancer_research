<h1>Cereals and its effects on breast cancer</h1>

    Given the results, improving skills, training and awareness is necessary for women and emphasis on modified diet is recommended as a non-medical option for prevention of breast cancer.

    Consistent with inverse but not statistically significant associations between whole grain intake and breast cancer in case-control studies, both whole and refined grain intakes are unrelated to risk of postmenopausal breast cancer in these Iowa women.

    This study is rather in favour of positive association between obesity, consumption of food rich in fatty matter and breast cancer, which is consistent with data from the literature using the same type of investigation. These results encourage increased cohort studies, case-control and experimentation in order to achieve a genuine code of cancer prevention, to define with precision the positive and negative.

    Rye products made from wholegrain rye flour are likely to contribute to reduced BC risk. Many risk factors for breast cancer (BC) have been identified, one of the more important being diet. However, it has been difficult to identify dietary components involved and mechanisms of action. The results are still controversial. In this short review the possible BC preventive role of wholegrain rye products, commonly consumed in all Nordic countries and the Baltic countries, Poland and Russia, will be discussed.
