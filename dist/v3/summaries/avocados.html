    The cytotoxic effects of persin are CASP-4 dependent and mediated by CHOP-dependent and -independent ERS signalling cascades. Increased ERS signalling contributes to persin-induced reversal of tamoxifen resistance. Breast cancer remains the most common cancer of women and the second most frequent cause of cancer death despite a major decline in breast cancer mortality in the past decade. However, despite the widespread clinical efficacy of endocrine therapies for the treatment of breast cancer, they are ineffective as therapy for oestrogen receptor (ER)-negative disease, and even among those patients with ER-positive disease that do initially respond, intrinsic or acquired therapeutic resistance remains a major obstacle to an effective cure (reviewed in Musgrove and Sutherland, 2009). Thus, there is a clear need for the development of novel therapeutic strategies that can enhance and broaden responsiveness, particularly in hormone refractory disease. There is now accumulating evidence that aberrant apoptosis regulation has an important role in the development of endocrine resistance (Butt et al, 2007; Musgrove and Sutherland, 2009). More specifically, recent studies have highlighted the role of the endoplasmic reticulum in the initiation of a pathologically and therapeutically relevant apoptotic programme (Moenner et al, 2007; Liao et al, 2008) which, when disrupted, can be associated with anti-oestrogen resistance (Gomez et al, 2007). Imbalances in endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis triggered through cellular stresses such as hypoxia, low glucose or through the accumulation of misfolded proteins leads to the generation of an endoplasmic reticulum-mediated stress response and the triggering of an intrinsic apoptotic pathway, mediated, in part, through the generation of ceramide (Liao et al, 2008). The endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) response has also been a recent focus from a cancer therapeutic perspective, given its emerging role as a protective mechanism against chemotherapy-induced cytotoxicity and as a potential initiating step in the development of chemoresistance (reviewed in Schönthal, 2009). Cancer cells often display elevated levels of ERS markers compared with their non-malignant counterparts, leading to the hypothesis that they exist in a state of chronic, low level ERS as an adaptive mechanism to enable growth and survival under adverse conditions, such as hypoxia and low nutrient environments. This differential ERS status of normal and malignant cells also provides an opportunity for therapeutic intervention as it may sensitise cancer cells to inducers of apoptosis. Phytochemicals have provided a particularly abundant source of anti-cancer agents (Nishino et al, 2005), and we have previously described a novel plant toxin, persin, that has unique, in vivo actions in the mammary epithelium and potent apoptotic effects in human breast cancer cells in vitro (Butt et al, 2006). Persin is an avocado acetogenin, derived from the biosynthesis of long-chain fatty acids with close structural homology to the essential n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA), linoleic acid. Interestingly, conjugated linoleic acids (linoleic acid isomers) have anti-carcinogenic properties with particular efficacy against breast cancer (Ip et al, 2002). Furthermore, other PUFAs structurally similar to persin can attenuate steroid hormone receptor sensitivity to circulating oestrogens by direct modulation of receptor levels, and these data have formed the rationale for a promising phase II clinical trial of gamma linoleic acid and the anti-oestrogen, tamoxifen as primary therapy for breast cancer, which demonstrated a significant improvement in the overall clinical response (Kenny et al, 2000). Persin also exhibits potent synergistic cytotoxicity with the active metabolite of tamoxifen, 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) in vitro in both ER-positive and ER-negative breast cancer cells, but not in phenotypically normal, breast epithelial cells (Roberts et al, 2007). This synergy is mediated via enhanced ceramide signalling—more specifically, persin generates de novo ceramide production that is further enhanced by 4-OHT&#x27;s inhibition of ceramide glycosylation (Roberts et al, 2007). Thus, the generation of an ERS response mediated by ceramide signalling could represent an upstream initiating event in persin-induced cytotoxicity, which could, in turn, impact on its ability to modulate tamoxifen responsiveness. Herein, we have further defined the mechanistic basis of persin-induced cytotoxicity and synergy with 4-OHT in human breast cancer cells, by determining its effects on ERS pathways in 4-OHT-sensitive and -resistant cell lines. We demonstrate that persin causes apoptosis in both 4-OHT-sensitive and -resistant cell lines. Persin treatment results in a robust ERS response with evidence that persin&#x27;s ability to augment the pro-apoptotic response to 4-OHT is mediated through enhanced ERS signalling. These data not only define the intracellular pathways mediating persin&#x27;s actions in breast cancer cells, but also highlight potential therapeutic strategies through which 4-OHT resistance may be overcome.
