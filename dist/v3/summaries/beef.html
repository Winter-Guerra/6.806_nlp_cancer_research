    Higher consumption of mutagens from meats cooked at higher temperature and longer duration was not associated with increased risk of postmenopausal breast cancer.

    Dietary fat consumed during adolescence may be associated with an elevated risk of breast cancer. Further studies to assess this relationship among postmenopausal women, and confirm these results in premenopausal women, are needed.

    Our results suggest that high intake of total vegetables, certain fruits, milk, and eggs may reduce the risk of breast cancer, while high consumption of animal-source foods may increase risk. The dietary associations did not appear to vary by ER/PR status.

    Overall, associations between breast cancer risk and consumption of red meat and poultry were of different magnitude in AA and Caucasian women, with further differences noted by menopausal and hormone receptor status in Caucasian women. This is the first study to examine racial differences in meat and breast cancer risk, and represents some of the first evidence in AA women.

    Mongolia’s low breast cancer incidence is of particular interest because of their unusual diet (primarily red meat and dairy) compared with other Asian countries. More intensive study of potential dietary, reproductive and lifestyle factors in Mongolia with comparison to other Asian populations may provide more clarity in what drives the international breast cancer rate differences.

    In this prospective study, red meat, MeIQx, and dietary iron elevated the risk of invasive breast cancer, but there was no linear trend in the association except for dietary iron. Evidence of the role of meat intake in breast cancer is mixed. There are conflicting findings from a pooled analysis of cohort studies (Missmer et al, 2002), and a meta-analysis of cohort and case–control studies (Boyd et al, 2003), yet several recent studies indicate that meat may increase the risk of postmenopausal breast cancer (Shannon et al, 2003; Steck et al, 2007; Taylor et al, 2007; Egeberg et al, 2008; Hu et al, 2008); meat-related exposures potentially involved, however, have not been well studied. Meat mutagens, such as heterocyclic amines (HCAs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), are formed in meat cooked to well done at high temperatures (Sinha et al, 2005). Haem iron, found mainly in red meat, is more bioavailable than non-haem iron and, although iron homoeostasis is tightly controlled, haem iron absorption is less well regulated (Carpenter and Mahoney, 1992). Meat mutagens induce (el-Bayoumy et al, 1995; Snyderwine et al, 2002) and iron promotes (Thompson et al, 1991; Diwan et al, 1997) mammary carcinogenesis in rodent studies. Iron may also be involved in breast cancer through interaction with catechol oestrogen metabolites or production of hydroxyl radicals (Liehr and Jones, 2001; Huang, 2003; Kabat and Rohan, 2007). Limited epidemiological studies of meat mutagens (De Stefani et al, 1997; Delfino et al, 2000; Sinha et al, 2000; Steck et al, 2007; Sonestedt et al, 2008; Kabat et al, 2009; Mignone et al, 2009) and haem iron (Lee et al, 2004; Kabat et al, 2007) are inconsistent. We used unique databases and a detailed meat questionnaire to comprehensively assess meat intake and potentially carcinogenic meat-related exposures in relation to postmenopausal invasive breast cancer in the prospective Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial.
