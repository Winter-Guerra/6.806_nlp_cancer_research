<h1>Omega-3 and its effects on breast cancer</h1>

    Higher intake of long-chain n-3 FA was associated with lower MD, suggesting that increased long-chain n-3 FA intake could be a strategy for breast cancer prevention.

    These results suggest that high consumption of fatty fish is associated with a reduced
         risk for breast cancer, and that the intake of ω-3 fatty acids from fish is inversely
         associated with postmenopausal breast cancer risk.

    This is the first investigation to report that a higher weight adjusted LBM is associated
         with higher estimated aerobic fitness and ability to perform push-ups in breast cancer
         survivors. Potential LCn-3 and physical activity interactions on LBM require further
         exploration.

    The supplementation of fish oil significantly (p &lt; 0.01) increased superoxide dismutases, glutathione reductase and catalase activity
         in red blood cells as well as the total plasma antioxidant status in the patients.
         This approach of using omega-3 fatty acids as an adjuvant treatment for breast cancer
         may help oncologists to manage the side effects of ongoing chemotherapy by improving
         the antioxidant status in patients.

    i) These findings reveal that the omega-3 PUFA ALA suppresses overexpression of HER2 oncogene at the transcriptional level, which, in turn, interacts synergistically with anti-HER2 trastuzumab- based immunotherapy. ii) Our results molecularly support a recent randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial suggesting that ALA may be a potential dietary alternative or adjunct to currently used drugs in the management of HER2-positive breast carcinomas. iii) Considering our previous findings demonstrating the &lt;&lt;HER2 upregulatory actions&gt;&gt; of the omega-6 PUFA linolenic acid (LA; 18:2n-6) and the &lt;&lt;HER2 down-regulatory actions &gt;&gt; of the omega-3 PUFA docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6n-3) and of the omega-9 monounsaturated fatty acid oleic acid (OA; 18:1n-9), it is reasonable to suggest that a low omega-6/omega-3 PUFA ratio and elevated MUFA levels, the two prominent &lt;&lt;fat features&gt;&gt; of the &lt;&lt;Mediterranean diet&gt;&gt;, should be extremely efficient at blocking HER2 expression in breast cancer cells.
