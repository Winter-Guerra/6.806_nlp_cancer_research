<h1>Milk and its effects on breast cancer</h1>

    The current analysis improved the predictability of drug transfer into milk, particularly for BCRP substrates, based on an exhaustive data overhaul followed by focused in vitro transport experimentation.

    The results of this study suggest that various cooking methods during adolescence and possibly in adulthood may be associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. These findings require confirmation.

    Dairy consumption is not strongly related to breast cancer risk in this prospective study. A non-significant negative association between calcium intake and breast cancer risk was seen, particularly among premenopausal women.

    Dietary fat consumed during adolescence may be associated with an elevated risk of breast cancer. Further studies to assess this relationship among postmenopausal women, and confirm these results in premenopausal women, are needed.

    These findings suggest that early life risk factor associations for breast cancer may differ according to breastfeeding status in infancy. The detection of widespread contamination of human breastmilk with environmental pollutants has raised concerns regarding potential adverse health effects.1, 2 A number of exogenous chemicals in breastmilk exhibit carcinogenic or xenoestrogenic activity, including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), chlorinated dioxins, chlorinated furans, polybrominated diphenylethers (PBDEs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and other pesticides.3-6 Due to the persistence and accumulation of these chemicals in the human body, maternal age is an important predictor of contaminant levels in breastmilk.7 Many of these contaminants are poorly metabolized, leaving breastfeeding as the primary means of excretion.2, 8 Parity has been inversely associated with breastmilk contaminant levels; first-born infants generally consume higher levels of contaminants relative to later siblings.7, 9, 10 Breastmilk consumption has been associated with greater levels of PCBs and related organochlorines in adipose tissue samples from children age 1âˆ’2 years.11 Studies among adults have hypothesized that organochlorine levels in adipose tissue may be related to increased breast cancer risk 12, 13, although evidence is currently insufficient to support an association.14 It is unknown whether exposure to contaminants in breastmilk has the potential to increase cancer risk in adulthood. Despite a wealth of epidemiologic research, evidence has been conflicting with modest or null associations with adult breast cancer risk reported for breastmilk consumption in infancy, birth order, and maternal age as primary exposures.15-55 With this background, we explored whether maternal age and birth order associations for breast cancer risk varied according to exposure to breastmilk in infancy. We hypothesized that, due to lesser exposure to environmental contaminants in breastmilk, increasing birth order and younger maternal age would be associated with decreased adult breast cancer risk only among women who were breastfed in infancy. We investigated this relation in a population-based case-control study of women in Wisconsin, USA.
