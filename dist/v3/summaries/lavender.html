    Association studies in a large pancreatic case-control study indicates that SNPs associated with breast cancer may also be associated with pancreatic cancer susceptibility and survival.

    In summary, entropy-based SEN-guided MDR facilitated the logical prioritization and evaluation of apoptotic SNPs in relation to aggressive PCA. The suggestive interaction between AKT3-PRKCQ and aggressive PCA requires further validation using independent observational studies.

    Our findings suggest inheritance of the VEGF
                                −2578C allele could serve as an independent prognostic indicator of BrCA prognosis. The VEGF
                                −2578 marker may have clinical implications among a subset of ER+/PR+ patients with an aggressive phenotype. Because the VEGF
                                −2578C allele is linked to high VEGF expression, this cytokine is a potential prognostic and targeted clinical management tool. LaCreis R. Kidd and Guy N. Brock contributed equally to this work.

    In summary, CCL5 (rs2107538, rs3817655) and CCR5 (rs1799988) sequence variants significantly modified PCA susceptibility among men of African descent, even after adjusting for age and multiple comparisons. Our findings are only suggestive and require further evaluation and validation in relation to prostate cancer risk and ultimately disease progression, biochemical/disease recurrence and mortality in larger high-risk subgroups. Such efforts will help to identify genetic markers capable of explaining disproportionately high prostate cancer incidence, mortality, and morbidity rates among men of African descent.

    Efavirenz-induced gynecomastia may occur in children as well as in adults. With the increasing access to ART, the possibility of efavirenz-exposure and the potential occurrence of its associated side-effects may be high. In resource-poor settings, empirical change from efavirenz to nevirapine may be considered, providing no other known or alarming cause is identified, as efavirenz-induced gynecomastia can resolve quickly after withdrawal of the drug. Timely recognition of gynecomastia as a side-effect of efavirenz is important in order to intervene while the condition may still be reversible, to sustain adherence to ART and to maintain the sociopsychological health of the child.

    Similar to our previous observations in human bladder cancer cells, Boswellia sacra essential oil induces breast cancer cell-specific cytotoxicity. Suppression of cellular
         network formation and disruption of spheroid development of breast cancer cells by
         Boswellia sacra essential oil suggest that the essential oil may be effective for advanced breast
         cancer. Consistently, the essential oil represses signaling pathways and cell cycle
         regulators that have been proposed as therapeutic targets for breast cancer. Future
         pre-clinical and clinical studies are urgently needed to evaluate the safety and efficacy
         of Boswellia sacra essential oil as a therapeutic agent for treating breast cancer.

    This community-based Workbook-Journal may be an effective psychosocial intervention for rural, isolated, and low-income women with breast cancer. Community involvement was essential to the success of this project. Women diagnosed with breast cancer require immediate and continuing educational and emotional support.1 Support groups designed to address these needs have improved knowledge about the disease,2,3 improved coping,4–8 decreased pain,9 reduced psychological distress,2,4,10,11 addressed fears of recurrence,12–15 improved quality of life,6,7,11 and even prolonged life.16 In rural settings, however, distance, education, and cost prohibit many women from participating in support groups. Although many organizations publish educational materials on cancer and treatment, patients must either collect different pamphlets for each question17–25 or wade through textbooks26,27 of information difficult to understand. More importantly, these educational publications do not include one of the most beneficial aspects of support groups: shared personal experiences.28 Rural women with breast cancer need a low-cost psychosocial intervention, appropriate for women with little advanced education, which can be delivered easily over long distances. Developing interventions for underserved populations, however, is fraught with difficulty. Assessing the needs of underserved patients using traditional assessment instruments and procedures often misses key elements of the problem. Developing an intervention that is accepted, culturally appropriate, and locally endorsed is an enormous challenge. Recruitment and retention of study participants are often so low as to make for questionable generalization of findings. In many cases, the only way to accurately assess and meaningfully address the needs of underserved groups is to include community representatives in the development, assessment, delivery, and evaluation of specifically designed and targeted interventions. We report here on a community–research partnership that successfully developed and scientifically evaluated a psychosocial intervention designed for underserved rural women with breast cancer.
