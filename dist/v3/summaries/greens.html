    Given the common use of antioxidant supplements during BC treatment, often at high doses and in conjunction with other complementary therapies, future research should address the effects of antioxidant supplementation on BC outcomes.

    There is a growing body of literature on the use of natural products for cancer prevention. To date, few trials have demonstrated conclusive benefit. Current guidelines recommend against the use of natural products for cancer prevention.

    Our study provides additional support for the hypothesis that a dietary pattern rich in fruit and salad might protect against invasive breast cancer and that the effect might be stronger for ER- and PR-negative tumours. Most of the studies on the risk of breast cancer in relation to individual foods and nutrients have had inconsistent results (Michels et al, 2007). Dietary pattern analysis is an increasingly common alternative approach for examining the relationship between diet and the risk of disease or biomarkers of disease (Newby and Tucker, 2004). Factor analysis applied to dietary data produces a few patterns of dietary intake that represent underlying independent dimensions of food and nutrient consumption. The assessment of dietary patterns in this way overcomes limitations of the single food or nutrient approach (Newby and Tucker, 2004). Two recent systematic literature reviews (Edefonti et al, 2009; Brennan et al, 2010) found consistent evidence that a ‘prudent&#x27;/‘healthy&#x27; dietary pattern was associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer. Breast cancer, similar to most cancers, is heterogeneous in its pathology, natural history and response to treatment. Breast cancer differ, for example, with respect to oestrogen (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) status; hormone receptor-positive cancers exhibiting better differentiated morphological appearance and stronger clinical response to hormonal treatment (Althuis et al, 2004). There is evidence to suggest that risk factors (Colditz et al, 2004), including food items (Olsen et al, 2003; Stripp et al, 2003; Suzuki et al, 2005; Zhang et al, 2005; Cho et al, 2006) and dietary patterns (Fung et al, 2005; Velie et al, 2005; Agurs-Collins et al, 2009) differ in their association by tumour receptor status. Using data from the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study (MCCS), we analyze the effect of dietary patterns on breast cancer risk overall, by attained age during follow-up and by tumour characteristics, including tumour grade and ER and PR status.

    These findings are consistent with a beneficial effect of choline and betaine intakes on carcinogenesis. Although nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a rare neoplasm in most regions of the world (an incidence of &lt;1 per 105 person-years), particularly high incidences have been observed in southern China, especially in the province of Guangdong (20–50 per 105 person-years) (Jia et al, 2006; Bray et al, 2008). According to statistical data reported by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, 33 101 new cases of NPC were diagnosed in China in 2008, accounting for ∼40% of new cases worldwide (Ferlay et al, 2008). Most of these cases occurred in persons 40–59 years of age and thus have the potential for enormous social devastation (Lee et al, 2003). Therefore, preventive strategies would have substantial benefit in this region. Development of NPC depends on the interaction between genetic susceptibility and environmental factors (for example, Epstein–Barr virus infection, exposure to carcinogens, dietary factors) (Lee et al, 2003). With the exception of salted fish (Lee et al, 2003), the role of dietary components is poorly understood. Choline is an essential nutrient widely distributed in animals and plants (Laird and Jaenisch, 1994). Although choline is endogenously synthesised, a choline-deficient diet leads to deficiency in humans (Zeisel et al, 1991). Choline is oxidised to betaine, which is linked to folate and serves as a methyl donor in one-carbon metabolism to affect the DNA methylation level in vivo (Laird and Jaenisch, 1994). DNA methylation is postulated to have an important role in carcinogenesis (Laird and Jaenisch, 1994). Deficiencies in dietary choline and betaine could increase the probability of hypomethylation independent of folate levels (Shin et al, 2010) and predispose an individual to the development of neoplasia. Recent epidemiological studies have revealed an inverse association between choline and/or betaine intake and several types of cancers such as breast cancer (Xu et al, 2009; Zhang et al, 2013), lung cancer (Ying et al, 2013) and oesophageal cancer (Ibiebele et al, 2011). From the results of these studies, it is reasonable to speculate that choline and/or betaine intake affects the risk of NPC. However, to our knowledge, there has been no epidemiological study pertaining to the association between dietary choline and/or betaine intake and the risk of NPC. Therefore, the primary goal of our study was to investigate whether intake of dietary choline and/or betaine has protective effects on the risk of NPC in a Chinese population. We also examined the modification of the effect by some potential risk factors, such as folate intake and alcohol consumption, because these factors might interact with choline to alter methylation levels (Cho et al, 2007b).

    This comprehensive prospective analysis suggests women with higher circulating levels of α-carotene, β-carotene, lutein+zeaxanthin, lycopene, and total carotenoids may be at reduced risk of breast cancer. Carotenoids, natural pigments ranging from yellow to red, are important for photosynthesis in plants. More than 600 carotenoids have been identified (1), approximately 40 are present in the US diet, 20 of which are measurable in tissue and serum. α-Carotene, β-carotene, β-cryptoxanthin, lutein, zeaxanthin, and lycopene are the most prevalent, comprising 90% of circulating carotenoids (1–3). These micronutrients are suspected to be anticarcinogenic, with possible biologic activities including antioxidation, enhanced gap-junction intercellular communication, immunoenhancement, inhibition of tumorigenesis and malignant transformation, and metabolism to retinoids, which, in turn, contribute to cellular differentiation (4–10). Experimental studies suggest carotenoids inhibit tumor progression and reduce proliferation in both estrogen receptor positive (ER+) and ER− breast cancer cells (11). Studies of dietary intake, of fruits and vegetables overall and carotenoids specifically, have had mixed results, although a modest inverse association has been suggested in several studies, as summarized in meta-analyses and pooled analyses (12–14). Several (15–19), but not all (20), studies of dietary patterns that include higher fruit and vegetable intake observed lower risk of ER−, but not ER+, breast tumors. Most recently, in pooled analyses of 18 cohort studies, stronger inverse associations were observed for ER− (vs ER+) tumors with intake of fruits and vegetables (S Y Jung, D Spiegelman, L Baglietto, et al., unpublished data) as well as intake of α-carotene, β-carotene, and lutein+zeaxanthin (21). Examining circulating carotenoid levels overcomes potential weaknesses of dietary data, including recall of past diet (3), inaccuracies of nutrient databases to determine carotenoid content of specific foods (22), influences of cooking and storage on carotenoid content (3,23), geographic and seasonal variation of foods (22), and individual differences in nutrient absorption. As a result of these limitations, the correlations between intake and plasma carotenoid levels are modest (r = 0.2–0.4) (24,25). Over the last 13 years, 10 prospective studies have investigated the associations between circulating carotenoids and breast cancer risk (26–35), eight of which are included in this analysis (26–33). Most studies observed inverse associations, either suggested or statistically significant, with at least one of five carotenoids (α-carotene, β-carotene, β-cryptoxanthin, lutein+zeaxanthin, lycopene), although the specific carotenoid and/or subgroup of importance varied among studies. The collaborating investigators of eight studies conducted a pooled analysis of original data examining associations between circulating carotenoids and breast cancer risk, the results of which are presented here.
