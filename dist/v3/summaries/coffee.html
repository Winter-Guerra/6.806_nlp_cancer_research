    Our findings suggest that intakes of tea, coffee, and caffeine are not associated with the risk of breast cancer among African-American women.

    A high daily intake of coffee was found to be associated with a statistically significant decrease in ER-negative breast cancer among postmenopausal women.

    Our findings suggest that coffee, black tea, and caffeine consumption before breast cancer diagnosis do not influence breast cancer-specific and overall survival.

    Higher caffeinated coffee intake may be associated with lower risk of postmenopausal breast cancer. Decaffeinated coffee intake does not seem to be associated with breast cancer.

    Findings from this prospective study do not support a role of coffee consumption in the development of breast cancer but suggest that black tea consumption may be positively associated with risk of ER+/PR+ tumors.

    Findings from this meta-analysis suggested that coffee/caffeine might be weakly associated with breast cancer risk for postmenopausal women, and the association for BRCA1 mutation carriers deserves further investigation.

    Moderate to high coffee consumption was associated with significantly decreased risk for early events in tamoxifen-treated patients and modified hormone receptor status. If confirmed, new recommendations regarding coffee consumption during tamoxifen treatment may be warranted.

    Our findings suggest that increased coffee intake is not associated with a significantly reduced risk of breast cancer, but we observe an inverse association in ER-negative subgroup analysis. More large studies are needed to determine subgroups to obtain more valuable data on coffee drinking and breast cancer risk.

    Fatigued breast cancer survivors have an abnormal proinflammatory cytokine activity, an average of 5 years after diagnosis, as well as significant serum cortisol derangements compared to other survivors. One possible interpretation of our results suggests that there is an abnormal hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis functioning in breast cancer patients with persistent fatigue, who might be using coffee to self-medicate. In other words, coffee consumption in the present study might be a surrogate marker for fatigue. Because of the paucity of data regarding caffeine intake, poor sleep, fatigue, and breast cancer survival, further studies could be worthwhile.
