<h1>Celery and its effects on breast cancer</h1>

    The present study suggests the intake of flavonols and flavones, but not other flavonoid subclasses or total flavonoids, is associated with a decreased risk of breast cancer, especially among post-menopausal women.

    The results from this study show that dietary soluble fiber intake is associated with a significantly reduced risk of ER− breast cancer among pre-menopausal women. Additional studies with larger sample size are needed to confirm these results.

    Our results demonstrate that the natural compounds, EGCG, genistein, withaferin A, curcumin, resveratrol, and guggulsterone, have the potential to reverse the epigenetic changes. Moreover, their lack of toxicity makes these natural compounds promising candidates for the chemoprevention of the breast cancer. In-depth future mechanistic studies aimed to elucidate how these compounds affect the gene transcription are warranted.

    R. graveolens extract contains bioactive compounds which, independently of known photoactivatable mechanisms, potently inhibit cancer cell proliferation and survival through multiple targets. Plants are important sources of medicinal compounds worldwide. A few examples are: aspirin from willow tree, digitalis from foxglove, artemisinin from wormwood, taxol from the pacific yew tree, vinblastine and vincristine from periwinkle, etoposide from mayapple, etc. More than 60% of cancer therapeutics on the market or in pre-clinical trials are based on natural products (1, 2). Despite the decline of interest by the pharmaceutical industry in research and development of natural compounds, these unrefined compounds from terrestrial and aquatic sources continue to serve as the chemical foundations from which modified or synthetic versions can be derived. Ruta graveolens is a medicinal and culinary plant that is native to the Mediterranean region of southern Europe and northern Africa. Widely grown in different parts of the world, this herb has historically been in use since the ancient times (3). Its documented therapeutic uses include the treatment of inflammatory conditions, eczema, ulcers, arthritis, fibromyalgia, antidote for venoms, insect repellent, and as an abortifacient (4–6). The plant has also been commonly used to season some food items such as soup, cheese, butter, coffee, and tea, and in medicinal preparations such as rue oil and infusions that are used as antispasmodics and emmenagogues (7). Chemical compounds so far known to be present in R. graveolens include furanocumarins, carotenoids, chlorophyll, and furanoquinolones (4, 8). Psoralens, a family of furanocumarins in R. graveolens, have been widely studied for their DNA inter-strand cross-linking activity when exposed to ultra violet (UV) light. This photoactivation property of psoralens has been utilized in the treatment of various skin malignancies including psoriasis, vitiligo and cutaneous lymphoma as a psoralen plus UV-A or UV-B (PUVA or PUVB) regimen (9–11). Although some bioactive components in the herbal extracts and infusions made from the herb R. graveolens plant have been suggested to be responsible for the plant’s beneficial or phototoxic effects, molecular studies that extensively decipher the activities of most of its bioactive ingredients are scarce. While the phytophototoxicity caused by R. graveolens has been known for long time, the bioactivities of R. graveolens extracts or its various preparations against tumor cells or pathogenic microbes have attracted attention only recently (12–17). This study examined the potency of an extract from R. graveolens on cancer cell lines. This study shows that this extract has potent anti-cancer activity, exhibited through strong anti-proliferative and ant-survival effects on cancer cells.
