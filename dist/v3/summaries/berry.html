<h1>Berry and its effects on breast cancer</h1>

    Among patients with node-positive, ER-negative breast cancer, biweekly doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide plus paclitaxel lowers the rate of recurrence and death by more than 50 percent in comparison with low dose CAF as used in the first study. Great strides have been made in the treatment of early-stage breast cancer. In patients with hormone-sensitive tumors, tamoxifen reduces the risk of recurrence and death by more than 30 percent.1 Moreover, treatment with aromatase inhibitors in place of or sequentially with tamoxifen further reduces the risk of recurrence in postmenopausal women with estrogen-receptor (ER)-positive tumors.2–4 In the absence of treatment, ER status is a weak prognostic factor, but it is a strong predictive factor in the sense that it identifies patients who benefit from endocrine therapy. With appropriate endocrine therapy, patients with ER-positive disease have substantially better prognoses as a group than do those with ER-negative disease. Evidence is accumulating that improvements in chemotherapy disproportionately benefit patients with ER-negative tumors. The most recent meta-analysis of randomized trials showed that for patients aged 50 to 69 years with ER-negative tumors not receiving tamoxifen, the reduction in the risk of recurrence due to any kind of polychemotherapy was 33 percent; for mortality it was 26 percent. For patients with ER-positive tumors receiving tamoxifen the respective reductions were 15 and 11 percent.1 The corresponding reductions for patients younger than 50 years were between 32 and 39 percent.1 The apparent lack of an interaction between chemotherapy benefits and estrogen-receptor status in this younger age group may be due to the small sample size, but also could be related to the impact of chemotherapy on ovarian function in younger women. The International Breast Cancer Study Group found that among patients with node-negative disease treated with tamoxifen, those with ER-negative tumors received substantial benefit from a three-cycle regimen of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil, with a 48 percent reduction in the risk of recurrence and a 49 percent reduction in the risk of death from any cause. This substantial benefit is in sharp contrast to those patients with ER-positive tumors for whom both risks were reduced by only 1 percent.5 The neoadjuvant setting provides further supportive evidence: tumors without hormone receptors are more sensitive to chemotherapy than are hormone-sensitive tumors, with markedly higher rates of pathological complete response.6–8 In a retrospective subset analysis, we addressed whether node-positive breast cancer patients with ER-negative disease benefit more from recent improvements in adjuvant chemotherapy than do those with ER-positive tumors treated with tamoxifen. We compared disease-free and overall survival according to ER status among patients enrolled in three consecutive randomized trials of chemotherapy conducted by the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) and the U.S. Breast Cancer Intergroup (including the Eastern Cooperative Group, the Southwest Oncology Group, and the North Central Cancer Treatment Group).
