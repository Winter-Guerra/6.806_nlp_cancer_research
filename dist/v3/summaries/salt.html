    These results suggest that some risk factors not commonly studied may be important for breast cancer and some frequently cited risk factors may be relatively unimportant or secondary.

    ER expression may not increase correspondingly with increasing degree of obesity.
         Highly obese patients are more likely to have tumor subtypes associated with high
         proliferation and poorer prognosis.

    The data reported here implicate mitochondrial and ER stress as a component of C-6’s
         biological activity and provide insight into non-apoptotic cell death mechanisms;
         targeting biological pathways that induce mitochondrial dysfunction and ER stress
         may offer new strategies for the development of therapeutics that are effective against
         chemoresistant breast cancers.

    The HRD scores showed strong correlation with BRCA1/2 deficiency regardless of breast cancer subtype. The frequency of elevated scores
         suggests that a significant proportion of all breast tumor subtypes may carry defects
         in the homologous recombination DNA repair pathway. The HRD scores can be combined
         to produce a more robust predictor of HRD. The combination of a robust score, and
         the FFPE compatible assay described in this study, may facilitate use of agents targeting
         homologous recombination DNA repair in the clinical setting.

    Taste alteration affects breast cancer patients’ lives, and they develop management strategies to deal with the effect. While some self-management strategies can be seen as positively adaptive, the potential for increased caloric consumption and poor eating behaviors associated with some coping strategies may be a cause for concern given the observation of weight gain during breast cancer treatment and association of obesity with poor treatment outcomes in breast cancer patients. Further studies are warranted to determine the overall burden of this symptom and measurement of cancer and non-cancer-related consequences of these behavioral adaptations.
