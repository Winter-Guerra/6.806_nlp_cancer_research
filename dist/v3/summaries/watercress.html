<h1>Watercress and its effects on breast cancer</h1>

    Here we show that when used in combination, these drugs are effective in both slowing cancer cell growth and killing ovarian cancer cells in vitro. Furthermore, the combination of these drugs remains effective in cisplatin resistant cell lines. Novel combinations such as metformin and PEITC show promise in expanding ovarian cancer therapies and overcoming the high incidence of cisplatin resistant cancers.

    GSTT1 and M1 genotypes are not likely to be involved in the rate of excretion of ITCs in watercress. The demonstrated differences in protection among subjects with the two genotypes are not likely due to differences in overall ITC excretion rates, however, excretion rates of ITCs other than PEITC need to be investigated. Other yet to be identified mechanism(s) may underlie the diet and gene interactions between dietary ITCs and GST genotypes in human cancer prevention. Further research is needed to evaluate the protective mechanisms of isothiocyanates against cancer.
