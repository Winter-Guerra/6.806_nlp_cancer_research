<p>In conclusion, ginger extract significantly reduced the elevated expression of NFκB and TNF-α in rats with liver cancer. Ginger may act as an anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory agent by inactivating NFκB through the suppression of the pro-inflammatory TNF-α.Citation: Journal:None, Date:None</p>
<p>The anticancer potential of ginger is well documented and its functional ingredients like gingerols, shogaol, and paradols are the valuable ingredients which can prevent various cancers. This review concludes to favor ginger but some ambiguities necessitate further research before claiming its efficacy.Citation: Journal:None, Date:None</p>
<p>Addition of ginger (1.5 g/d) to standard antiemetic therapy (granisetron plus dexamethasone) in patients with advanced breast cancer effectively reduces the prevalence of nausea 6 to 24 hours postchemotherapy. However, there is no other additional advantage for ginger in reducing prevalence or severity of acute or delayed CINV.Citation: Journal:Integrative Cancer Therapies, Date:09/06/12</p>
<p>Taking ginger capsules (for 6 days since 3 days before chemotherapy) accompanied by the routine antiemetic treatment could relieve chemotherapy-induced vomiting in all phases.Citation: Journal:None, Date:None</p>

<p>These findings suggest that the reduction of cell viability and apoptosis by GL may be a result of ATF3 promoter activation and subsequent increase of ATF3 expression through ERK1/2 activation in human colorectal cancer cells.Citation: Journal:None, Date:None</p>
<p>In conclusion, the combination of ginger and Gelam honey may be an effective chemopreventive and therapeutic strategy for inducing the death of colon cancer cells.Citation: Journal:None, Date:None</p>
<p>At present time, the evidence derived from this study is not sufficiently convincing that inhaled ginger aromatherapy is an effective complementary therapy for CINV. The findings for HRQoL were however encouraging with significant improvement in several domains.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

<p>Our data reveal a role for GLI1 in IBC cell proliferation, survival and migration, which supports the feasibility of targeting GLI1 as a novel therapeutic strategy for IBC patients.Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is one of the most lethal and highly invasive forms of locally advanced breast cancer with a 5-year survival rate of &lt;50%, which is significantly less than patients with non-IBC breast cancer (85%) (Hance et al, 2005; Cristofanilli et al, 2007). It is clear that IBC is phenotypically and molecularly distinct from other forms of locally advanced breast cancer and IBC tumours are particularly resistant to chemotherapeutic agents (Charafe-Jauffret et al, 2004; Lee et al, 2004; Cristofanilli et al, 2007). Gene expression profiling has linked genes such as LIBC (loss in IBC), Rho C, BP1 and E-cadherin to the IBC phenotype (Yamauchi et al, 2009). A gene expression profile that distinguished between IBC and non-IBC tumours identified sonic hedgehog (SHH) as being a part of a three-gene signature that was differentially regulated in IBC patients (Bieche et al, 2004). SHH, one of the three members of the mammalian Hh family of secreted ligands (Pathi et al, 2001), was noteworthy for being higher in patients who relapsed and had the most aggressive form of IBC (Bieche et al, 2004). Gene expression analysis of IBC and non-IBC tumour samples also identified Hh-pathway overexpression in IBC samples and that this was a predictor of the IBC phenotype (Van Laere et al, 2010).Hh signalling in vertebrates is mediated by the downstream zinc-finger transcription factors of the Gli protein family (Kinzler et al, 1988), with GLI-mediated transcription being the final step in the Hh pathway. In the absence of Hh, the receptor patched (PTCH) inhibits Hh-pathway activity through the inhibition of smoothened (SMO), a GPCR-like receptor that transduces the signal for the phosphorylation and proteolysis of GLI3 into a repressor form. GLI3 translocates to the nucleus and represses Hh target genes. When present, Hh binds to PTCH, which releases its inhibition of SMO. SMO is then able to transduce the signalling cascade through the GLI1 transcriptional activator form, which then can regulate the expression of Hh target genes including GLI1 and PTCH, making these genes markers for Hh-pathway activation (Ingham and McMahon, 2001; Kasper et al, 2006). Hh target genes are involved in cell proliferation, survival, differentiation, cell cycle, stem cells and invasion (Katoh and Katoh, 2009).Dysregulation of the Hh-Gli pathway in cancer has been reported and reviewed extensively (Kasper et al, 2006; Scales and de Sauvage, 2008; Yang et al, 2009), with Hh-ligand-dependent autocrine and paracrine (Yauch et al, 2008; Theunissen and de Sauvage, 2009), and Hh-ligand-independent mechanisms of activation observed (Rubin and de Sauvage, 2006). Activation of GLI via gene amplification has been linked to tumourgenesis in a number of tumours, including ovarian (Chen et al, 2007), endometrial (Feng et al, 2007), prostate (Karhadkar et al, 2004) and oesophageal (Mori et al, 2006) cancers. GLI1 contributes to the invasiveness of pancreatic (Nagai et al, 2008; Inaguma et al, 2011), prostate (Karhadkar et al, 2004), melanoma (Das et al, 2009) and glioma (Wang et al, 2010a) cancers. GLI1 is overexpressed in the majority of breast cancers (Xu et al, 2010) and a role for GLI1 in breast cancer invasiveness has been reported (Kameda et al, 2009; Souzaki et al, 2011). GLI1 overexpression has clinical impact and in breast cancer correlates with poor patient prognosis (Ten Haaf et al, 2009). A number of approaches have been taken to block Hh-Gli signalling at different steps in the pathway including natural products (Hosoya et al, 2008), synthetic small molecule inhibitors such as cyclopamine derivatives (Williams et al, 2003), blocking monoclonal antibodies (Ericson et al, 1996) and small interfering RNA (siRNA) (Sanchez et al, 2004). More recently, there is mounting evidence for alternative mechanisms for the activation of Hh-Gli pathway components (Testaz et al, 2001; Riobo and Manning, 2007; Jenkins, 2009; Chinchilla et al, 2010; Teglund and Toftgård, 2010), with upregulation of GLI by non-canonical pathways independent of Hh/SMO signalling reported (Lauth and Toftgard, 2007; Fernandez-Zapico, 2008; Nolan-Stevaux et al, 2009; Rizvi et al, 2010).In this study, we observed that the triple-negative, Basal-like IBC cell line SUM149, a widely used model for IBC (Ignatoski and Ethier, 1999; Hoffmeyer et al, 2005; Dong et al, 2007; Streicher et al, 2007; Aird et al, 2010; Wu et al, 2010; Singh et al, 2010a, 2010b), and rSUM149, an IBC cell line with acquired resistance to ErbB1/2 targeted agents (Aird et al, 2010), had significantly higher GLI1 expression than other cell lines tested and that targeting GLI1 by siRNA reduced cell proliferation and migration and increased apoptosis. We were able to quantify the effects of GLI1 silencing on migration using a high-content imaging assay that tracked multiple motility parameters of H2B-GFP-labelled cells. Our findings suggest that GLI1 has a role in the proliferation, migration and survival of the IBC cell lines.Citation: Journal:None, Date:None</p>
