      <li>
        Dairy consumption is not strongly related to breast cancer risk in this prospective study. A non-significant negative association between calcium intake and breast cancer risk was seen, particularly among premenopausal women.

        The results of this study suggest that various cooking methods during adolescence and possibly in adulthood may be associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. These findings require confirmation.
