<p>Curcumin and piperine separately, and in combination, inhibit breast stem cell self renewal but do not cause toxicity to differentiated cells. These compounds could be potential cancer preventive agents. Mammosphere formation assays may be a quantifiable biomarker to assess cancer preventive agent efficacy and Wnt signaling assessment a mechanistic biomarker for use in human clinical trials.Citation: Journal:None, Date:None</p>
<p>Docetaxel is one of the most widely used cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents and is currently the mainstay treatment for metastatic CRPC. Dietary constituents are important agents modifying drug metabolism and transport. In our studies, dietary consumption of piperine increases the therapeutic efficacy of docetaxel in a xenograft model without inducing more adverse effects on the treated mice.Citation: Journal:None, Date:None</p>
<p>The results indicate that short term use of this piperine-enhanced curcuminoid preparation is unlikely to result in a clinically significant interaction involving CYP3A, CYP2C9 or the paracetamol conjugation enzymes.Citation: Journal:None, Date:None</p>
<p>Conclusion: These results demonstrated that piperine is an effective antitumor compound in vitro and in vivo, and has the potential to be developed as a new anticancer drug.Citation: Journal:None, Date:None</p>
<p>Multiplicative, systematic biases are introduced at many stages of microarray experiments. When these are reconciled, raw data can be directly integrated from different gene expression datasets leading to new biological findings with increased statistical power.Citation: Journal:None, Date:None</p>
<p>Oral Capsol-TÂ® is well tolerated and, for ENOX2 presence in serum in the absence of clinical cancer symptoms, is consistently effective in reducing the serum ENOX2 levels to below detectable limits.Citation: Journal:None, Date:None</p>
