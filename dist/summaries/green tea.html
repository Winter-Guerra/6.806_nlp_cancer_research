<p>To date, the epidemiological data indicates that consumption of 5 or more cups of green tea a day shows a non-statistically significant trend towards the prevention of breast cancer development. Evidence indicates that green tea consumption may possibly help prevent breast cancer recurrence in early stage (I and II) cancers. However, conclusions as to the potential therapeutic application of green tea are currently impossible to make due to the small number of studies conducted, the lack of any clinical trial evidence, the lack of a consistent dose-response relationship, and the potential for interaction with standard care.Citation: Journal:None, Date:None</p>
<p>In this population-based prospective cohort study in Japan we found no association between green tea drinking and risk of breast cancer.Citation: Journal:None, Date:None</p>
