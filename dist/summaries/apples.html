<p>Age (&gt; 45 years), low family income (&lt; $520/month), poor educational level (primary school level or lower) and past regular consumption of pork fat and fatty meat may be factors associated with an increased risk of breast cancer.Citation: Journal:None, Date:None</p>
<p>We observed no association between total fruit and vegetable intake and risk of overallbreast cancer. However, vegetable consumption was inversely associated with risk ofER− breast cancer in our large pooled analyses.Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease. Expression of the estrogen receptor (ER) can beused to explain, in part, some of the differences in etiology, and clinical characteristics ofbreast cancer and survival rates among breast cancer patients (1–3). Breast tumors that express the ER (ER+tumors) are more strongly associated with hormone-related factors than tumors that do notexpress the ER (ER− tumors). Classic risk factors, such as late age at firstbirth and number of births, are more consistently associated with risk ofER+ breast cancer than with risk of ER− breast cancer(1). In addition, few risk factors have beenidentified for ER− breast cancer.Fruit and vegetable intake has been hypothesized to reduce the risk ofbreast cancer, but the current evidence is inconclusive. A recent meta-analysis of 14 cohortstudies reported a statistically significant 11% reduced risk of breast cancer overallcomparing high vs low fruit and vegetable intake; results were not reported for breast cancersubtypes defined by receptor status (4). Threecohort studies (5–7) have recentlyinvestigated the association between fruit and vegetable intake and risk of breast cancer byreceptor status. All three studies found that women who consumed higher levels of fruits andvegetables had a 32% to 50% lower risk of ER− breast cancer compared withwomen who consumed low levels of fruits and vegetables. In another cohort study that evaluatedonly dietary patterns, women consuming a high fruit or salad pattern were observed to have a45% lower risk of ER− breast cancer (8). Because the number of studies examining ER− breast cancer islimited, more evidence is needed to examine the role of diet in ER− breastcancer.One challenge in examining ER− breast cancer inepidemiologic studies is that ER− breast cancer accounts for only 15% to 20%of breast cancers (9). Thus, in most studies, thenumber of ER− breast cancer case patients is relatively low, which affectsthe power to detect modest associations with certainty.Therefore, with the advantage of a large number of case patients, weevaluated the relation between fruit and vegetable consumption and risk of breast cancer by ERstatus in a pooled analysis of 20 prospective cohorts. These analyses expand our prioranalyses of fruit and vegetable consumption and breast cancer risk (10) by including 12 more prospective studies and increasing thefollow-up time for most of the studies in the original analyses. In addition, only two of the20 studies in this pooled analysis have previously examined associations specifically withfruit and vegetable consumption and risk of ER− breast cancer (5, 6). Insecondary analyses, we examined tumors classified by progesterone receptor (PR) status.Citation: Journal:None, Date:None</p>
<p>The results from this study show that dietary soluble fiber intake is associated with a significantly reduced risk of ER− breast cancer among pre-menopausal women. Additional studies with larger sample size are needed to confirm these results.Citation: Journal:None, Date:None</p>
<p>Self-reported size and shape were consistent with anthropometric measures commonly used to assess obesity and fat distribution, respectively. Self-reported body shape may be a useful proxy measure in addition to body size in large-scale surveys.Citation: Journal:None, Date:None</p>
