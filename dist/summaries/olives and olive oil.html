      <li>
        Consumption of EVOO in moderate quantities and throughout the lifetime appears to be a healthy choice and may favourably influence breast cancer risk.

        Olive oil&#x27;s bitter principle (i.e., oleuropein aglycone) is among the first examples of how selected nutrients from an EVOO-rich &quot;Mediterranean diet&quot; directly regulate HER2-driven breast cancer disease.

      <li>
        The ability of EVOO-derived polyphenols to inhibit HER2 activity by promoting the proteasomal degradation of the HER2 protein itself, together with the fact that humans have safely been ingesting secoiridoids and lignans as long as they have been consuming olives and OO, support the notion that the stereochemistry of these phytochemicals might provide an excellent and safe platform for the design of new HER2-targeting agents.

        Olive oil consumption, specifically the extra-virgin variety, is associated with reduced risks of cardiovascular disease and mortality in individuals at high cardiovascular risk.
