        Findings from this meta-analysis suggest that cruciferous vegetables consumption may reduce the risk of breast cancer. Because of the limited number of studies, further prospective studies are needed to explore the protective effect of cruciferous vegetables on breast cancer. Copyright Â© 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

        Cruciferous vegetable intake might be inversely associated with pancreatic cancer risk. Because of the limited number of studies included in this meta-analysis, further well-designed prospective studies are warranted to confirm the inverse association between cruciferous vegetable intake and risk of pancreatic cancer.

        Our results suggest an overall null association between total fruit and vegetable intake and breast cancer risk. Intake of cruciferous vegetable showed a statistically significant association with a decreased risk of breast cancer among premenopausal women.

        Isothiocyanates enhance response to 4-hydroxytamoxifen, which allows for reduction of the effective drug concentration. Combinatorial strategy may hold promise in development of therapies and chemoprevention strategies against ER-positive breast tumors, even those with acquired resistance to the drug.

        These results indicate that SFN is a potent inhibitor of the viability of breast cancer cells representing different activity of the ErbB2/ER-PI3K-AktmTOR-S6K1 pro-survival pathway and suggest that it targets downstream elements of the pathway.
