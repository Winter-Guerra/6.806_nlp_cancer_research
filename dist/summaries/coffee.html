        Findings from this meta-analysis suggested that coffee/caffeine might be weakly associated with breast cancer risk for postmenopausal women, and the association for BRCA1 mutation carriers deserves further investigation. Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

        Higher caffeinated coffee intake may be associated with lower risk of postmenopausal breast cancer. Decaffeinated coffee intake does not seem to be associated with breast cancer.

        In this large cohort of Swedish women, consumption of coffee, tea, and caffeine was not associated with breast cancer incidence.

        Results from this prospective study showed no relationship between coffee, tea or caffeine intake and breast cancer risk overall or by hormone receptor status.

        Our findings suggest a possible influence of high coffee consumption or an increased coffee consumption on the risk of breast cancer.

        Findings from this prospective study do not support a role of coffee consumption in the development of breast cancer but suggest that black tea consumption may be positively associated with risk of ER+/PR+ tumors.

        Moderate to high coffee consumption was associated with significantly decreased risk for early events in tamoxifen-treated patients and modified hormone receptor status. If confirmed, new recommendations regarding coffee consumption during tamoxifen treatment may be warranted.

        Our findings suggest that coffee, black tea, and caffeine consumption before breast cancer diagnosis do not influence breast cancer-specific and overall survival. Coffee and black tea contain a mixture of compounds that have the potential to influence breast cancer risk and survival. Coffee may influence risk and progression through the inhibition of DNA methylation (Lee and Zhu, 2006), influences on tumour differentiation (Pozner et al, 1986), or alterations in sex hormone levels (Ferrini and Barrett-Connor, 1996; Nagata et al, 1998). Black tea has also been shown to alter sex hormone levels (Kuruto-Niwa et al, 2000; Wu et al, 2005), and the flavonoids it contains may have antioxidant effects (Trevisanato and Kim, 2000). Caffeine is found in both coffee and black tea, and in rodents has been shown to increase mammary cell differentiation (VanderPloeg et al, 1992) and decrease tumour incidence (Petrek et al, 1985). Conversely, caffeine has also been associated with increased mammary tumours in animal models (Welsch et al, 1983). Coffee consumption and breast cancer risk have been extensively studied with conflicting results (Ishitani et al, 2008; Bissonauth et al, 2009; Larsson et al, 2009a; Tang et al, 2009; Bhoo Pathy et al, 2010; Boggs et al, 2010; Nilsson et al, 2010; Fagherazzi et al, 2011; Gierach et al, 2011; Li et al, 2011). However, to our knowledge, only one observational study has examined coffee consumption and survival following breast cancer diagnosis (Sugiyama et al, 2010), and no studies have examined black tea or caffeine. In this study, we investigated whether pre-diagnosis coffee, black tea, and caffeine intake were associated with breast cancer survival among women diagnosed with invasive breast cancer in the population-based Swedish Mammography Cohort (SMC). We also examined whether the association between coffee, black tea, or caffeine and survival differed by hormone receptor status, disease stage at diagnosis, or smoking status.

        Our findings suggest that increased coffee intake is not associated with a significantly reduced risk of breast cancer, but we observe an inverse association in ER-negative subgroup analysis. More large studies are needed to determine subgroups to obtain more valuable data on coffee drinking and breast cancer risk.
