        Among patients with node-positive, ER-negative breast cancer, biweekly doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide plus paclitaxel lowers the rate of recurrence and death by more than 50 percent in comparison with low dose CAF as used in the first study. Great strides have been made in the treatment of early-stage breast cancer. In patients with hormone-sensitive tumors, tamoxifen reduces the risk of recurrence and death by more than 30 percent.1 Moreover, treatment with aromatase inhibitors in place of or sequentially with tamoxifen further reduces the risk of recurrence in postmenopausal women with estrogen-receptor (ER)-positive tumors.2–4 In the absence of treatment, ER status is a weak prognostic factor, but it is a strong predictive factor in the sense that it identifies patients who benefit from endocrine therapy. With appropriate endocrine therapy, patients with ER-positive disease have substantially better prognoses as a group than do those with ER-negative disease. Evidence is accumulating that improvements in chemotherapy disproportionately benefit patients with ER-negative tumors. The most recent meta-analysis of randomized trials showed that for patients aged 50 to 69 years with ER-negative tumors not receiving tamoxifen, the reduction in the risk of recurrence due to any kind of polychemotherapy was 33 percent; for mortality it was 26 percent. For patients with ER-positive tumors receiving tamoxifen the respective reductions were 15 and 11 percent.1 The corresponding reductions for patients younger than 50 years were between 32 and 39 percent.1 The apparent lack of an interaction between chemotherapy benefits and estrogen-receptor status in this younger age group may be due to the small sample size, but also could be related to the impact of chemotherapy on ovarian function in younger women. The International Breast Cancer Study Group found that among patients with node-negative disease treated with tamoxifen, those with ER-negative tumors received substantial benefit from a three-cycle regimen of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil, with a 48 percent reduction in the risk of recurrence and a 49 percent reduction in the risk of death from any cause. This substantial benefit is in sharp contrast to those patients with ER-positive tumors for whom both risks were reduced by only 1 percent.5 The neoadjuvant setting provides further supportive evidence: tumors without hormone receptors are more sensitive to chemotherapy than are hormone-sensitive tumors, with markedly higher rates of pathological complete response.6–8 In a retrospective subset analysis, we addressed whether node-positive breast cancer patients with ER-negative disease benefit more from recent improvements in adjuvant chemotherapy than do those with ER-positive tumors treated with tamoxifen. We compared disease-free and overall survival according to ER status among patients enrolled in three consecutive randomized trials of chemotherapy conducted by the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) and the U.S. Breast Cancer Intergroup (including the Eastern Cooperative Group, the Southwest Oncology Group, and the North Central Cancer Treatment Group).

        The transition to digital breast cancer screening in the United States increased total costs for small added health benefits. The value of digital mammography screening among women aged 40 to 49 years depends on women’s preferences regarding false positives. Over the past decade, digital mammography has rapidly replaced plain film mammography for breast cancer screening in the United States, accounting for 90% of the current market (1). This conversion was fueled in part by the 2005 Digital Mammographic Imaging Screening Trial (DMIST) report of superior digital mammography sensitivity compared with film for women aged younger than 50 years and for women with dense breasts (2). Multiple studies and recent reports from community practice show similar results as DMIST, although specificity has been modestly lower for digital mammography than film (3,4). The overall effect of this performance trade-off on population health and economic burden is unclear for several reasons. Dense breast tissue can both mask tumors and increase the risk of breast cancer (5–8). Therefore, higher tumor detection among women with dense breasts by digital mammography could improve screening benefits. However, because breast cancer prevalence is low at any single examination, even small decrements in specificity may be associated with large increases in the number of false positives and any associated harms and costs. In the Medicare population, digital mammography has been associated with a higher rate of early-stage cancers but no change in rates of advanced disease and with higher screening and diagnostic costs compared with film (9,10). An effect on mortality has not been shown. A prior cost-effectiveness analysis of substituting digital for film mammography based on the DMIST trial assumed equivalent specificity and found that, compared with using digital mammography for all women, greater health gains could be achieved at a lower cost by reserving digital for the subgroups for whom higher sensitivity had been found, with film used in other groups (11). However, a strategy involving a mix of film and digital mammography is no longer practical in the United States given the transition to virtually fully digital facilities. To understand the trade-offs involved in this rapid US adoption of new screening technology, we used five established independent models developed within the Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network (http://www.cisnet.cancer.gov) in partnership with the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC; http://www.breastscreening.cancer.gov). We extended our prior collaborative modeling research (12–14) to consider the impact of breast density on both incidence and test performance in evaluating outcomes from digital vs film screening. The results are intended to contribute to policy discussions about resource allocation and how to best integrate new technology into health care.

        Dose density improves clinical outcomes significantly, despite the lower than expected number of events at this time. Sequential chemotherapy is as effective as concurrent chemotherapy.

        Currently, anastrozole and letrozole are associated with the most complete data over the breast cancer care continuum, with efficacy in early-stage, locally advanced, and metastatic disease. In-direct comparisons suggest stronger evidence for the use of letrozole compared with other AIs for breast cancer in postmenopausal women who require estrogen-deprivation therapy. Data from randomized, double-blind comparative studies will help clarify the differences between AIs.

        Adjuvant HDC with AHST prolonged RFS in high-risk primary breast cancer compared with control, but this did not translate into a significant OS benefit. Whether HDC benefits patients in the context of targeted therapies is unknown.

        In this biologically high-risk group, pCR differs by receptor subset. pCR is more highly predictive of RFS within every established receptor subset than overall, demonstrating that the extent of outcome advantage conferred by pCR is specific to tumor biology.

        Standard adjuvant chemotherapy is superior to capecitabine in patients with early-stage breast cancer who are 65 years of age or older. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00024102.) Age is the major risk factor for breast cancer.1 In the United States, the average age at the diagnosis of breast cancer is approximately 63 years, and most deaths from breast cancer occur in women 65 years of age or older. Breast cancer in older women is not always managed according to treatment guidelines,2–4 and such lapses can adversely affect survival.5,6 Although adjuvant chemotherapy has improved survival among women with early-stage breast cancer,7,8 the Oxford Overview analysis of 15-year results included too few patients older than 70 years of age to assess the effect of chemotherapy in that age group accurately.7 Older women with breast cancer who are in good health tolerate chemotherapy about as well as younger patients,9,10 and the more severe toxicity of chemotherapy in older patients11 has not meaningfully affected the benefits of adjuvant chemotherapy.12 We report here the results of the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) 49907 trial, which was designed specifically to compare the efficacy of standard chemotherapy (either cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil [CMF] or doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide) with the oral fluorouracil prodrug, capecitabine, in women with early-stage breast cancer who were 65 years of age or older. Patients often prefer oral to intravenous chemotherapy,13 and an effective oral agent for adjuvant treatment would be important for treating older women with breast cancer. Capecitabine has substantial antitumor activity in metastatic breast cancer, with response rates of approximately 30%.14,15 In small, randomized trials involving women with metastatic breast cancer, the activity of capecitabine was similar to that of paclitaxel16 or CMF,17 making it a potential alternative to standard adjuvant chemotherapy.
