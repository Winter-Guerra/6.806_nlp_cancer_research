<p>Although the OmniHeart protein and unsaturated fat diets were superior to the carbohydrate diet in improving CVD risk, all 3 study diets were consistent with national guidelines to reduce chronic disease risk, which suggests that the guidelines might now be fine-tuned to optimize disease prevention. Popular diets vary in their nutritional adequacy and consistency with guidelines for risk reduction.Citation: Journal:None, Date:None</p>

<p>Total lignin intake was approximately four-fold higher in the Dutch lignin database, which includes the lignin precursors LARI and PINO, compared to estimates based on the Finnish database based only on SECO and MAT. The main sources of lignans according to the Dutch database in the five countries studied were cereals and grain products, vegetables, fruit, berries, and beverages.Plant lignans are plant-derived diphenolic compounds that belong to the group of phytoestrogens that are structurally similar to 17-estradiol. After ingestion, plant lignans are metabolized to the enterolignans enterodiol (END) and enterolactone (ENL) by colonic bacteria before they are absorbed (1, 2). END and ENL are detected in plasma within 8–10 h after intake of plant lignans (3), and their half-lives in plasma are approximately 5 and 13 h, respectively (4, 5). However, a substantial inter-individual variation has been detected in plasma concentrations and urinary excretion of enterolignans, partly due to the complex interaction between colonic environment and external and internal factors (6) which moreover, seems to be more dependent on the dietary lignan source than the absolute lignan intake (7). Reliable methods of exposure measurement are crucial for understanding the possible health benefits of plant lignans and the first step in this process is to establish comprehensive dietary databases to estimate plant lignan exposure in population-based studies (6).Observational studies have examined the association between habitual intake of plant lignans – estimated from the intake of selected food items and their content of two major precursors of enterolignans secoisolariciresinol (SECO) and matairesinol (MAT) – and risk of developing lifestyle-related diseases, such as cardiovascular disease (8, 9), breast cancer (10), and prostate cancer (11). The metabolite responsible is ENL showing an inverse association with postmenopausal breast cancer risk (12) and mortality risk due to coronary heart disease, cardiovascular disease (13), and breast cancer (14) at high ENL serum levels. Furthermore, animal experiments on rats (15) and studies in vitro showed a breast cancer protective effect of END and ENL that is discussed to be imputable to their higher biological activity (16). Dietary lignan intake was also found to decrease the risk of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and gastroesophageal junction on a case-control study (17).As progress has been made in this area, a food database of Dutch plant foods was published (18) with data on the content of SECO and MAT, as well as two more recently identified precursors of mammalian lignans, lariciresinol (LARI) and pinoresinol (PINO) (19). Estimated dietary intakes of lignans in the Dutch diet based on the new food database of Dutch plant foods (20) suggest that plant lignan intakes are much higher than first reported (21–24) and that LARI and PINO contribute approximately 75% to the estimated intake of plant lignans in the Dutch diet with the primary food group sources of lignans being beverages, vegetables, nuts and seeds, bread and fruits (20). A few oilseeds, such as flaxseed and sesame seeds have a high content of plant lignans (18), but the intake of such foods is only used by a small proportion of the population and commonly, the amounts consumed are low (20).In addition to the improved understanding of the importance of total lignan intakes, it has become clear that the contribution of selected food groups to the total plant lignan intake may be different than originally expected due to the contribution from LARI and PINO. Therefore, it is necessary to re-estimate and re-evaluate the total intake of plant lignans and contribution from different food groups to the total intakes in other European countries.The main objective of this study is to estimate the total intake of plant lignans and identify the main food sources of plant lignans in different European countries by using a Finnish lignan database (Fineli®) which includes two enterolignan precursors MAT and SECO and a Dutch lignan database which includes four enterolignan precursors SECO, MAT, LARI, and PINO.Citation: Journal:None, Date:None</p>
