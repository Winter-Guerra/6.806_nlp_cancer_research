        In general, the dietary patterns showed consistent results across the three cohorts except for the possible protective effect of PPP in the NLCS cohort, which could be explained by a difference in that pattern for NLCS. The results supported the suggestion derived from traditional epidemiology that relatively recent diet may not have an important role in the etiology of breast cancer.

        Although the exact mechanism is not clear, replacing two thirds of staple food with yam for 30 days improves the status of sex hormones, lipids, and antioxidants. These effects might reduce the risk of breast cancer and cardiovascular diseases in postmenopausal women.

        Our study provides additional support for the hypothesis that a dietary pattern rich in fruit and salad might protect against invasive breast cancer and that the effect might be stronger for ER- and PR-negative tumours. Most of the studies on the risk of breast cancer in relation to individual foods and nutrients have had inconsistent results (Michels et al, 2007). Dietary pattern analysis is an increasingly common alternative approach for examining the relationship between diet and the risk of disease or biomarkers of disease (Newby and Tucker, 2004). Factor analysis applied to dietary data produces a few patterns of dietary intake that represent underlying independent dimensions of food and nutrient consumption. The assessment of dietary patterns in this way overcomes limitations of the single food or nutrient approach (Newby and Tucker, 2004). Two recent systematic literature reviews (Edefonti et al, 2009; Brennan et al, 2010) found consistent evidence that a ‘prudent&#x27;/‘healthy&#x27; dietary pattern was associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer. Breast cancer, similar to most cancers, is heterogeneous in its pathology, natural history and response to treatment. Breast cancer differ, for example, with respect to oestrogen (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) status; hormone receptor-positive cancers exhibiting better differentiated morphological appearance and stronger clinical response to hormonal treatment (Althuis et al, 2004). There is evidence to suggest that risk factors (Colditz et al, 2004), including food items (Olsen et al, 2003; Stripp et al, 2003; Suzuki et al, 2005; Zhang et al, 2005; Cho et al, 2006) and dietary patterns (Fung et al, 2005; Velie et al, 2005; Agurs-Collins et al, 2009) differ in their association by tumour receptor status. Using data from the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study (MCCS), we analyze the effect of dietary patterns on breast cancer risk overall, by attained age during follow-up and by tumour characteristics, including tumour grade and ER and PR status.

        Our findings suggest that dietary vitamin C intake before breast cancer diagnosis may be associated with breast cancer survival. In addition, post-diagnosis vitamin C supplementation at the level observed in our population was not associated with survival. Vitamin C is a water-soluble nutrient that has been hypothesised to influence cancer initiation and promotion through its antioxidant properties including the neutralization of free radicals (Frei, 1994; Willcox et al, 2004). In addition, in vitro experiments have shown cytotoxic action of vitamin C against cancer cells without subsequent toxicity to normal cells (Chen et al, 2008; Ullah et al, 2011). However, the evidence from observational epidemiologic studies on vitamin C intake and survival following breast cancer diagnosis is not consistent, with dietary vitamin C intake reported to reduce the risk of mortality in some studies (Rohan et al, 1993; Ingram, 1994; Jain et al, 1994; Fleischauer et al, 2003; McEligot et al, 2006) and no association in other studies (Zhang et al, 1995; Hebert et al, 1998; Holmes et al, 1999; Saxe et al, 1999; Saquib et al, 2011). In addition, the safety of oral vitamin C supplements following cancer diagnosis is not clear (Lawenda et al, 2008) and few studies have examined vitamin C supplements in relation to breast cancer survival (Greenlee et al, 2009; Nechuta et al, 2011; Greenlee et al, 2012). The aim of this study was to investigate whether pre-diagnosis dietary vitamin C intake was associated with total and breast cancer-specific mortality among women diagnosed with invasive breast cancer in the Swedish Mammography Cohort (SMC). We also examined whether the association between vitamin C and survival differed by hormone receptor status, disease stage at diagnosis, age, body mass index (BMI) and smoking. In a subset of women, we examined whether vitamin C supplement intake following breast cancer diagnosis was associated with survival.

        In addition to lifestyle and socioeconomic factors, health-related factors like smoking and diabetes were found to influence potato consumption. The high potato consumption group had an especially high consumption of fish and a low consumption of pasta/rice, though the nutrient density in the groups was similar. The potato was introduced in Norway in the mid-1700s. Potato growing had its breakthrough during the war in 1807–1808, and it became an extremely important contributor in terms of food security and poverty alleviation (1). Today boiled potatoes, together with meat or fish, vegetables and gravy, are a central component of a Norwegian supper (2, 3) and are an important source of fibre, niacin, folate, and vitamin C (4, 5). Despite its role as a nutrient-rich staple food, there has been a drastic decline in the consumption of potatoes, particularly boiled potatoes, in Norway over the past 40 years (2, 6). This follows a similar trend that has been taking place in most Northern and Central European countries (2). Potatoes have a high glycaemic index and load (7–9), which might be one reason why they have fallen into disrepute. Due to the dramatic effect potatoes have on blood sugar and insulin secretion, several researchers in nutrition have put potatoes on top of their food pyramid as a food that should be eaten only occasionally (10). Studies have shown that diets with low glycaemic index and/or low glycaemic load are associated with a reduced risk of several chronic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and several cancers (11). Reviews of studies on potato consumption and human health have reported beneficial associations between potatoes and cardiometabolic health (5) and several cancers (12). However, studies on the long-term cancer-related health effects of potato consumption are lacking (12). There is also a lack of clinical trial data on the impact of potatoes on weight management, and the results of several cohort studies carried out on this topic are contradictory (5). Contradictory results have also been reported regarding potato consumption and diabetes (12). Potatoes are usually eaten as part of a meal, and therefore the impact potatoes have on disease risk may depend on the foods they are grouped with in a dietary pattern (5). Previous studies have shown that age, area of residence, income, education and household structure are important determinants of potato consumption (2, 4, 13). The aim of this study is to gain a better understanding of which factors influence potato consumption among women in the Norwegian Women and Cancer (NOWAC) study, and which potential confounders should be considered in future studies of potato consumption and health outcomes.
