<h1>Butter and its effects on breast cancer</h1>

        The results of the study suggest a negative association between consumption of fat used for seasoning (except butter) and breast cancer risk. This may be a direct effect or due to increased consumption of salad-type vegetables by high consumers of these sources of fats. The topic should be addressed in other studies in different populations.

        Analysis of food avoidance by women with breast cancer who participate in diet-intervention studies and by women without breast cancer may provide information about adherence to dietary guidelines and adequate nutrient consumption among these populations.

        A possible association of elements of adolescent diet with risk of breast cancer is reported, but the findings require confirmation in prospective study.

        In general, the dietary patterns showed consistent results across the three cohorts except for the possible protective effect of PPP in the NLCS cohort, which could be explained by a difference in that pattern for NLCS. The results supported the suggestion derived from traditional epidemiology that relatively recent diet may not have an important role in the etiology of breast cancer.

        Adherence to healthy dietary patterns (including whole grains, fruits, and vegetables, olive oil, and fish) seems to be favorable in not having breast cancer, among middle-aged women.

        A diet characterized by a low P/S ratio seems to be more important for the development of breast cancer than total fat intake.
