<p>High folate intake was associated with decreased breast cancer risk. Vitamin B12 intake may modify this association.Citation: Journal:None, Date:None</p>
<p>We observed no association between total fruit and vegetable intake and risk of overallbreast cancer. However, vegetable consumption was inversely associated with risk ofER− breast cancer in our large pooled analyses.Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease. Expression of the estrogen receptor (ER) can beused to explain, in part, some of the differences in etiology, and clinical characteristics ofbreast cancer and survival rates among breast cancer patients (1–3). Breast tumors that express the ER (ER+tumors) are more strongly associated with hormone-related factors than tumors that do notexpress the ER (ER− tumors). Classic risk factors, such as late age at firstbirth and number of births, are more consistently associated with risk ofER+ breast cancer than with risk of ER− breast cancer(1). In addition, few risk factors have beenidentified for ER− breast cancer.Fruit and vegetable intake has been hypothesized to reduce the risk ofbreast cancer, but the current evidence is inconclusive. A recent meta-analysis of 14 cohortstudies reported a statistically significant 11% reduced risk of breast cancer overallcomparing high vs low fruit and vegetable intake; results were not reported for breast cancersubtypes defined by receptor status (4). Threecohort studies (5–7) have recentlyinvestigated the association between fruit and vegetable intake and risk of breast cancer byreceptor status. All three studies found that women who consumed higher levels of fruits andvegetables had a 32% to 50% lower risk of ER− breast cancer compared withwomen who consumed low levels of fruits and vegetables. In another cohort study that evaluatedonly dietary patterns, women consuming a high fruit or salad pattern were observed to have a45% lower risk of ER− breast cancer (8). Because the number of studies examining ER− breast cancer islimited, more evidence is needed to examine the role of diet in ER− breastcancer.One challenge in examining ER− breast cancer inepidemiologic studies is that ER− breast cancer accounts for only 15% to 20%of breast cancers (9). Thus, in most studies, thenumber of ER− breast cancer case patients is relatively low, which affectsthe power to detect modest associations with certainty.Therefore, with the advantage of a large number of case patients, weevaluated the relation between fruit and vegetable consumption and risk of breast cancer by ERstatus in a pooled analysis of 20 prospective cohorts. These analyses expand our prioranalyses of fruit and vegetable consumption and breast cancer risk (10) by including 12 more prospective studies and increasing thefollow-up time for most of the studies in the original analyses. In addition, only two of the20 studies in this pooled analysis have previously examined associations specifically withfruit and vegetable consumption and risk of ER− breast cancer (5, 6). Insecondary analyses, we examined tumors classified by progesterone receptor (PR) status.Citation: Journal:None, Date:None</p>
<p>The study revealed that the risk factors for breast cancer among women in the Tabriz area of Iran are related to the lifestyle. Therefore, the provision of education to change unhealthy lifestyle choices and periodic check-ups for early breast cancer detection are recommended.Citation: Journal:None, Date:None</p>
<p>Regardless of stage, a small proportion of survivors’ self-reported dietary and exercise behaviors match their perceived benefits of diet and exercise. Factors such as access, motivation, and lack of co-morbidities among early stage survivors may prevent them from living healthier post-diagnosis. More thorough dietary and clinical measurements will provide greater certainty. Thus, innovative, sustainable programs must be accessible and provide motivation and social support from family, friends, and other survivors to truly improve quality of life.Citation: Journal:None, Date:None</p>
<p>Higher baseline (post-treatment) physical activity was associated with improved survival. However, change in activity over the following year was not associated with outcomes. These data suggest that long-term physical activity levels are important for breast cancer prognosis.Citation: Journal:None, Date:None</p>
<p>Consumption of fruit and vegetables could be linked directly to carotenoid concentrations in adipose tissue and plasma. Although associations with individual food items are related to their carotenoid contents, the absorption and distribution of carotenoids needs more attention to improve their usefulness as biomarkers of exposure.Citation: Journal:None, Date:None</p>
<p>A minority of breast cancer survivors follow a healthy lifestyle that includes both recommended intakes of vegetables-fruits and moderate levels of physical activity. The strong protective effect observed suggests a need for additional investigation of the effect of the combined influence of diet and physical activity on breast cancer survival.Citation: Journal:None, Date:None</p>
<p>Our array CGH analysis with BAC clones could detect various genomic alterations in ER-positive breast cancers, and Recurrence group samples showed a significantly different pattern of DNA copy number changes than did Non-recurrence group samples.Citation: Journal:None, Date:None</p>
<p>Oral Capsol-T® is well tolerated and, for ENOX2 presence in serum in the absence of clinical cancer symptoms, is consistently effective in reducing the serum ENOX2 levels to below detectable limits.Citation: Journal:None, Date:None</p>
<p>Literature evidence actually demonstrates that the increased adherence to the Mediterranean dietary pattern is beneficial to health across populations and may translate a protective effect with certain cancers.Citation: Journal:None, Date:None</p>
<p>The comparable extent of risedronate absorption when administered either 0.5–1 h before breakfast or 2 h after an evening meal support previous clinical studies where risedronate was found to have similar effectiveness using these dosing regimens. This flexibility in the timing of risedronate administration may provide patients an alternative means to achieve the desired efficacy while maintaining their normal daily routine.Citation: Journal:None, Date:None</p>
