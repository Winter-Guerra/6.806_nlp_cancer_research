        A major novelty of our study was the use of a statistical method that correctly accounts for the intra-SAGE and inter-SAGE library sources of variation. The most useful result of applying this modified t statistics beta binomial test is the identification of genes and gene families commonly deregulated across samples within each specific stage in the transition from normal to preinvasive and invasive stages of breast cancer development. Most of the gene expression abnormalities detected at the in situ stage were related to specific genes in charge of regulating the proper homeostasis between cell death and cell proliferation. The comparison of in situ lesions with fully invasive lesions, a much more heterogeneous group, clearly identified as the most importantly deregulated group of transcripts those encoding for various families of proteins in charge of extracellular matrix remodeling, invasion and cell motility functions.

        The integration of the breast cancer comparative transcriptome analysis based on ERÎ± status coupled to the genome-wide identification of high-affinity EREs and GO over-representation analysis, provide useful information for validation and discovery of signaling networks related to estrogen response in this malignancy.

        Our results suggest that Sclareol, by reducing Treg cells frequency and also tumor size can enhance the effect of cancer therapy as an immuno-stimulant.

        Our analysis leads to the unexpected and remarkable suggestion that ER, PR, and HER2 status, or molecular subtype classification, do not provide additional prognostic value when the values of the FGD3-SUSD3 and attractor metagenes are taken into consideration.

        High-dose chemotherapy and autologous PBSCT is a potentially highly effective treatment of women with metastatic and poor prognosis primary breast cancer. Randomised studies are required to compare this form of therapy to more standard forms of treatment in breast cancer.

        Our study provides evidence indicating that GATA3 is probably a mediator for the transcriptional upregulation of MUC1 expression in some breast cancers.
