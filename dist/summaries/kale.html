<p>These results suggest prominent in vitro anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects of ST in MDA-MB-231 cells. This study provides valuable insight into the chemopreventive efficacy and associated molecular alterations of ST in breast cancer cells whereas it had only moderate efficacy on lung cancer cells and did not show any considerable effect on skin cancer cells. These findings would form the basis for further studies to understand the mechanisms and assess the potential utility of ST as a cancer chemopreventive agent against breast cancer.Citation: Journal:None, Date:None</p>
<p>Insomnia complaints exceed 50% among AI users. Clinically significant insomnia is highly associated with joint pain, hot flashes, anxiety and depression, age, and time since diagnosis.Citation: Journal:None, Date:None</p>
<p>c.29C&gt;T and c.74G&gt;C polymorphisms in the TGF-β1 gene significantly affect breast cancer risk, which correlates with elevated TGF-β1 level in the patients. The c.29C&gt;T locus is polymorphic across ethnically different populations, but c.74G&gt;C locus is monomorphic in Tibeto-Burmans and polymorphic in other Indian populations.Citation: Journal:None, Date:None</p>
<p>These findings suggest that the supplementation of kale juice affected blood pressure, lipid profiles, and blood glucose in subclinical hypertensive patients depending on their GST genetic polymorphisms, and the improvement of lipid profiles was mainly greater in the GSTT1-present genotype and the decrease of blood glucose was greater in the GSTM1-present or GSTT1-null genotypes.Citation: Journal:None, Date:None</p>
