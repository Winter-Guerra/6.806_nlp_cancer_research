<p>Even though all epidemiological studies do not provide a strong positive association between the consumption of certain types of dietary fat and breast cancer risk, at least a moderate association does seem to exist and this has a number of implications in view of the fact that breast cancer is an increasing public health concern.Citation: Journal:None, Date:None</p>
<p>There is a growing body of literature on the use of natural products for cancer prevention. To date, few trials have demonstrated conclusive benefit. Current guidelines recommend against the use of natural products for cancer prevention.Citation: Journal:None, Date:None</p>

<p>Although the results of the 2012 versus the 2009 analysis were encouraging in terms of the accuracy of EPA declared on the supplement labels, the high peroxide levels found in the supplement oils are of concern. High peroxide levels are associated with potential health implications. EE were present in some of the supplements, even though the safety of EE has not been confirmed in vulnerable groups such as pregnant women and children.Scientific research and media exposure as well as raising health and nutritional awareness among consumers have led to a substantial rise in fish oil supplementation over the past five years. It is predicted that sales of omega-3 (n-3) fatty acid products in the United States (US) will increase from $25.4 billion in 2011 to $34.7 billion in 2016 (pers commun).Even though n-3 fatty acid supplements capture only 13% of the US n-3 product market, the highest retail dollar value of the supplements is in the fish oil as opposed to packaged food, beverages and infant formulas where the n-3 content is relatively small. The South African market for fish oil capsules over the past 12 months is estimated to be worth about R65 million (pers commun), however this figure only includes data from large retail store groups and not from privately owned businesses.A whole array of health benefits are attributed to the long-chain polyunsaturated n-3 fatty acids found in fish oil. The n-3 fatty acids of particular interest are eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). These fatty acids are eminent as anti-thrombotic, anti-arrhythmic and anti-aggregatory compounds.1Routine intake of oily fish and fish oil are now widely acknowledged for their role in decreasing the risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) such as fatal coronary heart disease and stroke. N-3 fatty acids are also renowned for their anti-inflammatory properties and may be beneficial in reducing the risk of inflammatory-related conditions including obesity, Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, type 2 diabetes, asthma, psoriasis, multiple sclerosis, cystic fibrosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.2 The significance of EPA and DHA in neural and visual development is also well documented.3In a typical Western diet there are only a few food sources contributing to dietary n-3 fatty acid intake. Research indicates that plant-derived n-3 fatty acids in the form of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) are poorly converted to EPA and DHA,4 while preformed EPA and DHA from fish oil is readily available for metabolism. Several clinical trials have shown that baseline EPA and DHA blood levels can be increased by means of good-quality fish oil supplements.Clinical trial results from our group indicated low dietary EPA and DHA intakes, as reflected in the baseline blood levels of healthy, normo-lipidaemic, non-smoking research participants residing in Cape Town. Typical baseline red blood cell values varied between 3 and 5%.5 According to Harris’s proposed n-3 index,6 these levels position participants in a high- to intermediate- risk zone for the development of CVD. As Cape Town is located on the west coast of South Africa with its cold sea currents, one could expect that cold-water fatty fish consumption will be higher among people residing here compared to residents living in the provinces without a coastline. Consumers further away from the coast may therefore experience even lower n-3 fatty acid levels in their blood.However, canned fatty fish such as pilchards, sardines, salmon and mackerel are rich in n-3 fatty acids. These products are readily available to the majority of consumers and should theoretically help them to obtain their daily n-3 fatty acid intakes. Unfortunately the affordability of the products as well as some consumers’ preferences for red meat as a protein source may prevent them from purchasing these products. It therefore seems that progressively more consumers turn to fish oil supplements to augment their n-3 fatty acid intakes, as it is perceived to be an easy, effective and safe method to rectify poor dietary intakes.Yet controversy exists whether n-3 fatty acids consumed via supplementation is the best way to combat disease. Some reviews investigating the risk of major cardiovascular events reported no association between n-3 fatty acid supplementation and a reduced risk of all-cause mortality, cardiac death, sudden death, myocardial infarction or stroke,7 or for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease.8 On the other hand, other reviews9,10 did indicate associations between risk reduction of cardiovascular disease and n-3 fatty acid dietary supplements. According to Jump et al.,9 conflicting results may be attributed to people at risk for cardiovascular disease who take medications such as statins and fibrates as well as drugs with anti-inflammatory, anti-arrhythmic and anti-thrombotic effects, minimising the detectable effect of supplemental n-3 fatty acids.Dietary recommendations and advice for the intake of n-3 fatty acids have progressed notably during the past five years. No formal dietary reference intakes (DRIs) currently exist for EPA and DHA but intakes that vary from 250 to 600 mg EPA + DHA are recommended; however there are still many gaps in research7.Achieving these amounts through fish intake alone might be problematic without supplementation. To reach a 500-mg/day EPA + DHA as recommended by the International Society for Fatty Acids and Lipids (ISSFAL12) with purified fish oil, about 2 000 mg of oil with a 180-mg EPA to 120-mg DHA content ratio would be required. To consume these amounts of EPA + DHA through diet/non-supplementation, approximately 79 g/day of tuna or 60 g/day of pilchards or 52 g/day of salmon should be consumed. In addition, fish is not the dietary protein of choice for many South Africans.For an n-3 fatty acid supplementation to be effective, good-quality fish oil is essential. The quality of fish oil supplements is highly affected by the storage conditions of the refined oil before encapsulation, the nature of the preservative added to prevent oxidation, the time period of storage and light exposure. The EPA and DHA content of fish oil is also subjective to the fluctuation of long chain n-3 fatty acids even within single fish species and is further dependent on geographic origin, season and preparation of the oil.In a survey13 conducted in 2009 by our research group, where we studied the quality of 45 fish oil supplements available on the South African market, it appeared that supplements varied to a large extent in terms of the measured versus the claimed content of EPA and/or DHA, the level of lipid peroxidation, the EPA-to-DHA ratios as well as the number of capsules and price to meet international dietary recommendations. These findings are of concern since no regulatory structure to monitor the quality of dietary supplements currently exists in South Africa. Consumers therefore depend on self-regulation within the neutraceutical industry for assurance of product quality, consistency, potency and purity of fish oil supplements.Since the survey was conducted in 2009, no new labelling and quality-assurance regulations have been published. It was therefore decided to repeat the survey, this time on 63 supplements, to assess if there were any improvements in the quality of fish oil supplements available to the South African consumer. Specific objectives for the survey included analysis and comparison of the EPA and DHA contents of the supplements with the contents claimed on the product label; number of capsules and price to achieve international n-3 fatty acid intake recommendations; to determine the conjugated diene (CD) and peroxide content of the supplement oils; and to determine whether the long-chain n-3 fatty acids present in the capsules were in the form of triglycerides (TG) or ethyl esters (EE) or a combination of TG and EE.Citation: Journal:None, Date:None</p>
