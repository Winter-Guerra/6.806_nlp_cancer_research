<p>An excess of energy intake, particularly from refined bread and pasta, can be an unfavourable feature of the Mediterranean diet, in the presence of a sedentary lifestyle.Citation: Journal:None, Date:None</p>
<p>Our results suggest that high intake of total vegetables, certain fruits, milk, and eggs may reduce the risk of breast cancer, while high consumption of animal-source foods may increase risk. The dietary associations did not appear to vary by ER/PR status.Citation: Journal:None, Date:None</p>
<p>We observed no association between total fruit and vegetable intake and risk of overallbreast cancer. However, vegetable consumption was inversely associated with risk ofER− breast cancer in our large pooled analyses.Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease. Expression of the estrogen receptor (ER) can beused to explain, in part, some of the differences in etiology, and clinical characteristics ofbreast cancer and survival rates among breast cancer patients (1–3). Breast tumors that express the ER (ER+tumors) are more strongly associated with hormone-related factors than tumors that do notexpress the ER (ER− tumors). Classic risk factors, such as late age at firstbirth and number of births, are more consistently associated with risk ofER+ breast cancer than with risk of ER− breast cancer(1). In addition, few risk factors have beenidentified for ER− breast cancer.Fruit and vegetable intake has been hypothesized to reduce the risk ofbreast cancer, but the current evidence is inconclusive. A recent meta-analysis of 14 cohortstudies reported a statistically significant 11% reduced risk of breast cancer overallcomparing high vs low fruit and vegetable intake; results were not reported for breast cancersubtypes defined by receptor status (4). Threecohort studies (5–7) have recentlyinvestigated the association between fruit and vegetable intake and risk of breast cancer byreceptor status. All three studies found that women who consumed higher levels of fruits andvegetables had a 32% to 50% lower risk of ER− breast cancer compared withwomen who consumed low levels of fruits and vegetables. In another cohort study that evaluatedonly dietary patterns, women consuming a high fruit or salad pattern were observed to have a45% lower risk of ER− breast cancer (8). Because the number of studies examining ER− breast cancer islimited, more evidence is needed to examine the role of diet in ER− breastcancer.One challenge in examining ER− breast cancer inepidemiologic studies is that ER− breast cancer accounts for only 15% to 20%of breast cancers (9). Thus, in most studies, thenumber of ER− breast cancer case patients is relatively low, which affectsthe power to detect modest associations with certainty.Therefore, with the advantage of a large number of case patients, weevaluated the relation between fruit and vegetable consumption and risk of breast cancer by ERstatus in a pooled analysis of 20 prospective cohorts. These analyses expand our prioranalyses of fruit and vegetable consumption and breast cancer risk (10) by including 12 more prospective studies and increasing thefollow-up time for most of the studies in the original analyses. In addition, only two of the20 studies in this pooled analysis have previously examined associations specifically withfruit and vegetable consumption and risk of ER− breast cancer (5, 6). Insecondary analyses, we examined tumors classified by progesterone receptor (PR) status.Citation: Journal:None, Date:None</p>
<p>A diet characterized by a low P/S ratio seems to be more important for the development of breast cancer than total fat intake.Citation: Journal:None, Date:None</p>
<p>The results from this study show that dietary soluble fiber intake is associated with a significantly reduced risk of ER− breast cancer among pre-menopausal women. Additional studies with larger sample size are needed to confirm these results.Citation: Journal:None, Date:None</p>
<p>The role of vitamin supplements in preventing breast cancer still remains unclear, considering our review. Although biologic mechanisms exist to support the anticancer effects of vitamins, there is no clear evidence for an effect in cancer prevention for vitamin supplements. Further investigations are warranted to elucidate the mechanisms by which vitamin supplementation can modify breast cancer development.Citation: Journal:None, Date:None</p>
<p>Overall, this study supports the feasibility of designing dietary interventions for stage II–IV ovarian cancer survivors and provides preliminary evidence that a low fat high fiber diet and a diet supplemented with encapsulated FVJC may increase phytonutrients in ovarian cancer survivors.Citation: Journal:None, Date:None</p>
<p>Ecologic associations between food availability and disease vary considerably on the basis of whether mortality or incidence rates are used in the analysis. Great care is thus necessary when interpreting our results.Citation: Journal:None, Date:None</p>
<p>These results suggest that the pentane-based fractions of DCOE possess potential anti-cancer activity that is mainly mediated through the Erk pathway.Citation: Journal:None, Date:None</p>
<p>The study revealed that the risk factors for breast cancer among women in the Tabriz area of Iran are related to the lifestyle. Therefore, the provision of education to change unhealthy lifestyle choices and periodic check-ups for early breast cancer detection are recommended.Citation: Journal:None, Date:None</p>
