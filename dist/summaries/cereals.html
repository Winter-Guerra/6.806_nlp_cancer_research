        Rye products made from wholegrain rye flour are likely to contribute to reduced BC risk. Many risk factors for breast cancer (BC) have been identified, one of the more important being diet. However, it has been difficult to identify dietary components involved and mechanisms of action. The results are still controversial. In this short review the possible BC preventive role of wholegrain rye products, commonly consumed in all Nordic countries and the Baltic countries, Poland and Russia, will be discussed.

        Given the results, improving skills, training and awareness is necessary for women and emphasis on modified diet is recommended as a non-medical option for prevention of breast cancer.
