        These results suggest that risk estimates associated with mammographic density are not distinct for separate breast cancer subtypes (basal-like/triple negative vs. luminal A breast cancers). Studies with a larger number of basal-like breast cancers are needed to confirm our findings.

        Basal-like breast carcinomas are aggressive tumors with poor prognosis. Lack of targeted therapy makes their treatment a challenging task. Traditional chemotherapy is still associated with a high risk of relapse and death in a high percentage of patients. Platinum-based chemotherapy has been considered as a candidate for the treatment of BLBCs owing to their BRCA1 phenotype. Approximately 22% of patients treated with single-agent cisplatin show pathologic complete response, which is a comparable rate to that seen with nonplatinum agents. Antiangiogenic agents have been promising, but their currently demonstrated limited response is considered disappointing. Additionally, epidermal growth factor receptor was not shown to be a helpful target for BLBC. A recent study has shown that BLBC appears to be especially sensitive to MEK inhibitors, making it a promising therapeutic possibility. The list of new targets is still evolving and the &quot;magic&quot; therapeutic target is yet to be discovered.

        Expression of PD-L1 is rare in breast cancer, markedly enriched in basal-like tumours and is correlated with infiltrating lymphocytes. PD-L1 inhibition may benefit the 19% of patients with basal-like tumours in which the protein is expressed.

        Triple-negative tumors are synonymous with basal-like tumors, and can be identified by immunohistochemistry. Based on gene-expression profiling, basal-like tumors are still heterogeneous and can be subdivided into at least five distinct subgroups. The development of distant metastasis in basal-like tumors is associated with the presence of central fibrosis and a small amount of lymphocytic infiltrate.

        Expression of CK5/6 and HER-1 is frequent in ER-negative breast cancers, in triple negative and in non-triple negative tumours. In a minority of cases, HER-1 overexpression may be caused by HER-1 gene amplification. Further studies are needed to investigate whether such cases might benefit from anti-HER-1 therapy.
