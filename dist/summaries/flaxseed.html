<p>This Canadian study is, to our knowledge, the first to report on the association between flaxseed alone and breast cancer risk and has found that flaxseed intake is associated with a reduction in breast cancer risk. As dietary intake of flaxseed is modifiable, this finding may be of public health importance with respect to breast cancer prevention.Citation: Journal:Cancer Causes Control, Date:03/28/13</p>
<p>IL-1 may be under the control of estrogen in vivo and may be attenuated by antiestrogen therapy and diet modifications. The increased IL-1Î² in breast cancers of women strongly suggests IL-1 as a potential therapeutic target in breast cancer treatment and prevention.Citation: Journal:The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology &amp; Metabolism, Date:12/10/14</p>
