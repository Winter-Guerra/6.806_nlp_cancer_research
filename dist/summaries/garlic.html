        Cloves are natural products with excellent cytotoxicity toward MCF-7 cells; thus, they are promising sources for the development of anticancer agents.

        These results suggest that DADS both inhibits the proliferation of MCF-7 cells and induces apoptosis of MCF-7 cells. The mechanisms may include the inhibition of ERK and the activation of the SAPK/JNK and p38 pathways.

        DATS inhibits MMP2/9 activity and the metastasis of TNBC cells, and emerges as a potential anti-cancer agent. The inhibitory effects are associated with down-regulation of the transcriptional activities of NF-κB and ERK/MAPK signaling pathways.

        The data confirms that protein fractions purified from fresh garlic bulbs
augment CD8+ T-cell infiltration into the tumor site, inhibiting tumor growth more efficiently
than garlic extract. These ﬁndings provide a basis for further investigations
on the purified polypeptide as a useful candidate for immunomodulation and tumor
treatment.

        Our results showed that BMI, history of BBD biopsy, older AOM, SA and menopause were associated with increased risk of breast cancer among Chinese women. The findings derived from the study provided some suggestions for population-based prevention and control of breast cancer in China.
