        We conclude that walnuts in the diet inhibit colorectal cancer growth by suppressing angiogenesis. Further studies are needed to confirm our findings in humans and explore underlying mechanisms.

        The results identify AM as a target for therapeutic intervention against bone metastases. Adrenomedullin potentiates osteolytic responses in bone to metastatic breast cancer cells. Small-molecule antagonists can effectively block bone-mediated responses to tumor-secreted adrenomedullin, and such agents warrant development for testing in vivo.

        Risk for contralateral second primary breast cancers varies substantially by HR status of the first tumor, age, and race and/or ethnicity. Women with HR-negative first tumors have nearly a 10-fold elevated risk of developing HR-negative second tumors, compared with the general population. These findings warrant intensive surveillance for second breast cancers in women with HR-negative tumors.

        Compared to foreign-born, US-born Hispanic women in California had higher prevalence of breast cancer risk factors, suggesting that incidence patterns largely reflects these differences in risk factors.

        These findings suggest that early life risk factor associations for breast cancer may differ according to breastfeeding status in infancy. The detection of widespread contamination of human breastmilk with environmental pollutants has raised concerns regarding potential adverse health effects.1, 2 A number of exogenous chemicals in breastmilk exhibit carcinogenic or xenoestrogenic activity, including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), chlorinated dioxins, chlorinated furans, polybrominated diphenylethers (PBDEs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and other pesticides.3-6 Due to the persistence and accumulation of these chemicals in the human body, maternal age is an important predictor of contaminant levels in breastmilk.7 Many of these contaminants are poorly metabolized, leaving breastfeeding as the primary means of excretion.2, 8 Parity has been inversely associated with breastmilk contaminant levels; first-born infants generally consume higher levels of contaminants relative to later siblings.7, 9, 10 Breastmilk consumption has been associated with greater levels of PCBs and related organochlorines in adipose tissue samples from children age 1−2 years.11 Studies among adults have hypothesized that organochlorine levels in adipose tissue may be related to increased breast cancer risk 12, 13, although evidence is currently insufficient to support an association.14 It is unknown whether exposure to contaminants in breastmilk has the potential to increase cancer risk in adulthood. Despite a wealth of epidemiologic research, evidence has been conflicting with modest or null associations with adult breast cancer risk reported for breastmilk consumption in infancy, birth order, and maternal age as primary exposures.15-55 With this background, we explored whether maternal age and birth order associations for breast cancer risk varied according to exposure to breastmilk in infancy. We hypothesized that, due to lesser exposure to environmental contaminants in breastmilk, increasing birth order and younger maternal age would be associated with decreased adult breast cancer risk only among women who were breastfed in infancy. We investigated this relation in a population-based case-control study of women in Wisconsin, USA.

        The distribution of breast cancer subtypes among AYAs varies from that observed in older women, and varies further by race/ethnicity. Observed subtype distributions may explain the poorer breast cancer survival previously observed among AYAs.

        Following the cessation of HT use, alcohol consumption is not significantly associated with breast cancer risk, although a non-significant increased risk was observed among women who never used HT.

        Recently reported reductions in breast cancer incidence varied considerably by race/ethnicity. These patterns are consistent with documented racial/ethnic differences in the prevalence and discontinuation of hormone therapy (HT) after July 2002 but do not correspond as well to patterns of mammography use in these groups. The data presented in this analysis provide further evidence that population-level HT use is a major influence on population-level rates of particular breast cancer subtypes, especially receptor-positive tumors.

        Ongoing surveillance of breast cancer occurrence patterns in this high-risk population informs breast cancer etiology through comparison of trends with lower-risk populations and by highlighting the importance of examining how broad migration patterns influence the geographic distribution of risk factors.
