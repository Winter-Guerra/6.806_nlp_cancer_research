        Our results suggest a modestly elevated risk of breast cancer after longer periods of rotating night work. Additional studies are warranted to rule out small sample size or uncontrolled sources for confounding as alternative explanations.

        We show for the first time that exposure to diethyl phthalate, the parent compound of MEP, may be associated with increased risk of BC, whereas exposure to the parent phthalates of MBzP and MCPP might be negatively associated. These findings require confirmation. Phthalates are endocrine disruptors that have shown effects on reproductive health and development. Infertility, decreased sperm counts, cryptorchidism, reproductive tract malformations, hypospadias, and testicular tumors, as well as reduction on testosterone levels, anogenital distance, and reproductive organ weights and nipple retention, have been described both in animal and human studies (National Research Council 2008). Exposure to various phthalates in adult men has been associated with altered semen quality, reduced concentration of certain sexual and thyroid hormones, reduced pulmonary function, and increases in certain metabolic syndrome markers (Hauser and Calafat 2005; Swan 2008). In boys, prenatal exposure to some phthalates has been associated with a reduced anogenital distance (Swan et al. 2005). Exposure to phthalates before birth has been related to gestational age, and exposure during childhood has been associated with respiratory problems, asthma, and allergies (Adibi et al. 2009; Hauser and Calafat 2005; Swan 2008; Wolff et al. 2008). Several phthalates, such as diethyl phthalate (DEP) and dibutyl phthalate (DBP), are widely used, especially in cosmetic and personal care products for infants, children, and adults. Other phthalates, including diisobutyl phthalate (DiBP), butylbenzyl phthalate (BBzP), di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), and di-n-octyl phthalate (DOP), can be used as plasticizers in the manufacture of flexible vinyl plastic in consumer products, flooring and wall coverings, food contact applications, and medical devices. Phthalates can also be used as solvents in combination with other plasticizers in floor coverings as well as in some cosmetics and pharmaceutical products (David and Gans 2003; Frederiksen et al. 2007; Meeker et al. 2007). Some phthalates can be absorbed through the skin (Janjua et al. 2007); in addition, they can be ingested, because they can migrate from wrappers and containers to foods (Wormuth et al. 2006). The metabolism of most phthalates in humans occurs first by hydrolysis of one ester bond to form the hydrolytic phthalate monoesters. Some phthalates may undergo a phase I biotransformation in which oxidative metabolites are formed. Both monoester and oxidative metabolites may react with glucuronic acid in a phase II biotransformation to form their respective glucuronide conjugates. The phase II conjugation facilitates urinary excretion of the phthalate metabolites (Silva et al. 2003). The urinary concentrations of phthalate metabolites have been used extensively to assess exposure to phthalates in epidemiologic studies. The metabolism of phthalates was recently reviewed by Frederiksen et al. (2007) and the National Research Council (2008). Women may be at a higher risk than men for potential adverse health effects of phthalates due to phthalate exposure through cosmetics use. However, potential effects of phthalate exposure have been documented primarily in males. Health effects in women have been scarcely characterized, and studies have been limited to endometriosis (Cobellis et al. 2003; Reddy et al. 2006a, 2006b) and thyroid hormone changes (Huang et al. 2007). Breast cancer (BC) is hormone dependent. Less than 25% of patients have a history of early menarche, later age at first childbirth, nulliparity, family history of BC, or history of benign breast biopsy (Rockhill et al. 1998); however, in most cases the causes of breast tumors are unknown, and environmental and genetic factors may play a role. The purpose of this study was to examine the association between exposure to six phthalates, estimated from urinary concentrations of nine selected phthalate metabolites, and the risk of BC among a group of northern Mexican women.

        These results, particularly that obtained in nontumorigenic/immortalized MCF10A cells, suggest that chemopreventive activity of cabbage against breast cancer observed in epidemiological studies may be partly explained by inhibition of the aromatase expression.

        Epidemiologic evidence suggests that cruciferous vegetable intake may be weakly and inversely associated with lung cancer risk. Due to a gene-diet interaction, the strongest inverse association was among those with homozygous deletion for GSTM1 and GSTT1.
