        (1) Cancer is a worldwide problem. (2) A modification of diet and lifestyle could reduce morbidity and mortality. (3) Early detection through screening improves prognosis and reduces mortality.

        Taken together, our data suggested that brewers’ rice can inhibit cell proliferation, induce apoptosis, and suppress COX-2 and β-catenin expression via the Wnt signaling pathway and holds great promise in the field of chemoprevention as a dietary agent.

        GBR phenolics moderately regulate the expression of ER-β, HSP70, and IL-4 receptor genes, and gave a positive immunoreaction to ER-β antigen in the uterus. ASG regulates the expression of CaBP9k and IL-4 receptor genes, and ORZ regulates the expression of the CaBP9k gene, while GABA at 100 mg/kg regulates the expression of the HSP70 gene. GBR and its bioactives might have an effect on estrogen-regulated genes in the uterus of rats.

        The results from this study show that dietary soluble fiber intake is associated with a significantly reduced risk of ER− breast cancer among pre-menopausal women. Additional studies with larger sample size are needed to confirm these results.

        We provide evidence that brewers’ rice can induce apoptosis and inhibit the proliferation of HT-29 cells through regulation of caspase-dependent pathways and inhibit the Wnt/β-catenin downstream signaling pathway in vivo. We suggest that brewers’ rice may be a useful dietary agent for colorectal cancer.
