        Classifying TNBC by 7 subtypes predicts high vs. low pCR rate. We confirm the clinical relevancy of the 7 subtypes of TNBC. We need to prospectively validate whether the pCR rate differences translate into long-term outcome differences. The 7-subtype classification may spur innovative personalized medicine strategies for TNBC patients.

        Missing a mammogram, even in the year before a breast cancer diagnosis, increases the chance of a cancer diagnosis at a later stage. Interventions to encourage use of mammography may be of particular benefit to women most likely to miss mammograms, including those with no family history of breast cancer, fewer encounters with the health care system, and greater travel distance to the mammography center.

        No significant differences were observed in overall and disease-free survival based on blood group. No correlation was noted between HER2eu, ER or PR status, and blood group type. Among this cohort, HER2eu positivity was less than 20% and correlated with a 5-year disease-free survival rate â‰¥75% and overall survival of &gt;80% across all blood groups. The role of glycosylation as a common feature regulating expression of various molecules which undergo change in expression patterns during malignant transformation promotes the possibility that some inter-relationships and/or patterns of expression among these molecules may be discernable as a consequence of altered glycosylation. Further, these patterns may correlate with outcomes. Correlation of blood group, hormone receptor status, and patient outcomes remains largely unexplored. Knowledge of any relational patterns that may exist between blood type and hormone receptor status as a consequence of altered glycosylation patterns occurring during oncogenesis would be important to recognize clinically, especially if such patterns are related to outcomes. The study described herein examined ABO isotype and hormone receptor status and their impact on outcomes in a cohort of patients with breast cancer. This cohort represents a subset of a well-defined, racially and ethnically homogeneous reference population, minimizing confounding related to population-based heterogeneity relative to these factors. Using a retrospective study design of 426 breast cancer patients whose ABO blood type, hormonal status, and clinical outcomes were captured in the electronic medical record (EMR) of Marshfield Clinic and the Regional Cancer Registry Database, the present study evaluated relational patterns among the following elements: status of ABO, HER2eu, estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor (ER/PR), stage, physiological parameters and treatment, clinical outcomes relative to time to recurrence, and 5-year survival in breast cancer patients in a homogeneous population in central Wisconsin.
