        The supplementation of fish oil significantly (p &lt; 0.01) increased superoxide dismutases, glutathione reductase and catalase activity in red blood cells as well as the total plasma antioxidant status in the patients. This approach of using omega-3 fatty acids as an adjuvant treatment for breast cancer may help oncologists to manage the side effects of ongoing chemotherapy by improving the antioxidant status in patients.

        These results suggest that high consumption of fatty fish is associated with a reduced risk for breast cancer, and that the intake of ω-3 fatty acids from fish is inversely associated with postmenopausal breast cancer risk.

        These results indicate that a high-fat diet rich in omega-3 fatty acids can suppress human breast cancer cell growth and metastases in this mouse model system.

        Higher intake of long-chain n-3 FA was associated with lower MD, suggesting that increased long-chain n-3 FA intake could be a strategy for breast cancer prevention.

        The combination of Lovaza and Ral is a feasible strategy that may be recommended in future breast cancer chemoprevention trials.

        i) These findings reveal that the omega-3 PUFA ALA suppresses overexpression of HER2 oncogene at the transcriptional level, which, in turn, interacts synergistically with anti-HER2 trastuzumab- based immunotherapy. ii) Our results molecularly support a recent randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial suggesting that ALA may be a potential dietary alternative or adjunct to currently used drugs in the management of HER2-positive breast carcinomas. iii) Considering our previous findings demonstrating the &lt;&lt;HER2 upregulatory actions&gt;&gt; of the omega-6 PUFA linolenic acid (LA; 18:2n-6) and the &lt;&lt;HER2 down-regulatory actions &gt;&gt; of the omega-3 PUFA docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6n-3) and of the omega-9 monounsaturated fatty acid oleic acid (OA; 18:1n-9), it is reasonable to suggest that a low omega-6/omega-3 PUFA ratio and elevated MUFA levels, the two prominent &lt;&lt;fat features&gt;&gt; of the &lt;&lt;Mediterranean diet&gt;&gt;, should be extremely efficient at blocking HER2 expression in breast cancer cells.

        This is the first investigation to report that a higher weight adjusted LBM is associated with higher estimated aerobic fitness and ability to perform push-ups in breast cancer survivors. Potential LCn-3 and physical activity interactions on LBM require further exploration.
