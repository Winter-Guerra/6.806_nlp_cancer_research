        In this single-arm study, 24 weeks of glucosamine/chondroitin resulted in moderate improvements in AI-induced arthralgias, with minimal side effects, and no changes in estradiol levels. These results suggest a need to evaluate efficacy in a placebo-controlled trial.

        These results suggest that high consumption of fatty fish is associated with a reduced risk for breast cancer, and that the intake of ω-3 fatty acids from fish is inversely associated with postmenopausal breast cancer risk.

        Overall, no association between estimated dietary dioxin exposure and BC risk was found among E3N women. Further studies should include both dietary and environmental exposures to determine whether low-dose dioxin exposure is associated with BC risk.

        This method eliminates the painful preoperative injections of 99mTc colloid, is performed by the surgeon in the operating room, is associated with lower radiation exposures for personnel, and avoids the delays caused by nonoperating room personnel. These observations warrant a more extensive trial of this method using the 1000-μCi dose of 125I methylene blue dye for sentinel lymph node biopsies. Sentinel lymph node biopsy was initially developed as a technique for the detection of regional lymph node metastasis in patients with melanoma by Morton et al.1 The evolution of the procedure as a means to detect the presence of axillary lymph node metastasis in patients with breast cancer developed shortly thereafter. In less than 10 years following the initial reports utilizing this technique, dozens of studies have appeared in the scientific literature validating use of sentinel node biopsy as an accurate means of detecting metastatic disease in the axillary lymph nodes in patients with breast cancer.2–5 Almost simultaneously, reports appeared in the literature documenting the success of sentinel node localization using either isosulfan blue dye alone or using isosulfan blue dye in conjunction with technetium99m labeled sulfur colloid (99mTcSC). While most authors use a combination of blue dye and 99mTcSC, Guiliano et al continue to report excellent results using isosulfan blue dye alone.6 Conversely, Krag et al report similar excellent results using only radiotracer.2,3 Currently, the majority of breast surgeons prefer to use both dye and radiotracer for their evaluation of sentinel nodes. In recent years, others have published studies suggesting that sentinel node accuracy and yield could be duplicated with the use of methylene blue dye as opposed to isosulfan blue dye.7–9 This change in dye preference has found its way into the practice of a significant population of breast surgeons. Injection of small quantities (0.1–0.5 mL) of methylene blue into the breast during needle/wire breast cancer mammographic localization procedures has been done for years and has been associated with no reported adverse effects.10 In a similar fashion, injection of methylene blue in the web space between the toes has been used widely as a method to detect lymphatic channels for their cannulation for lymphangiograms. With the development of the sentinel node biopsy method of evaluating axillary lymph node status in women with breast cancer came some unanticipated consequences for both surgeon and patient alike. Patients must undergo a separate preoperative injection of radiocolloid prior to their surgery. The radiocolloid injection is commonly performed a minimum of 2 hours preoperatively, often the afternoon prior to surgery or more typically the morning of surgery. Patients uniformly note that the radiocolloid injection is very painful. The injection is painful whether it is injected in small quantities intradermally or in larger quantities around the periphery of a tumor.11,12 With the advent of sentinel lymph node biopsy as an alternative standard of care for breast conservation candidates, there has been an increase in patient and referring-physician demand for this less invasive procedure. Surgeons have often been forced to deal with major delays in their surgical schedules based on the requirement for an additional preoperative procedure that is performed at the discretion of nonoperating room personnel, specifically nuclear medicine physicians and technicians.13 A single, simultaneous injection of blue dye and radiocolloid in the operating room at the time of breast cancer surgery would obviate the need for an additional preoperative procedure for the patients and would prevent delays in the surgical schedule. Unfortunately, 99mTc sulfur colloid has high-energy gamma emissions and a significant amount of activity (1–10 mCi) is commonly injected to ensure adequate node uptake. Much of this activity must clear from the injection site before the hand-held gamma probe can effectively discriminate individual nodes in the axilla from the injection site We have devised a simple, economically feasible way to produce a sterile, pyrogen-free 125I-labeled methylene blue dye. Preliminary animal experimentation showed rapid transit to regional nodes and limited systemic biodistribution.14 When absorbed systemically, the radiolabeled dye is rapidly cleared in the urine. We hypothesized that admixing small quantities of the 125I labeled methylene blue dye (0.1–0.5 mL) in a much larger (4.5–4.9 mL) quantity of unlabeled methylene blue dye should offer the surgeon all the specificity of a 2-stage sentinel lymph node biopsy procedure, enhanced intraoperative 2-point discrimination based on the low energy of 125Iodine&#x27;s gamma emissions, and potentially offer increased safety based on 125Iodine&#x27;s low-energy (35 Kev) gamma emissions. More importantly, the use of a 1-step intraoperative procedure would be painless and would obviate the need for a second procedure performed outside of the operating room by nonsurgical personnel.

        Population data raise concerns about the validity of the current safe intake level that uses the kidney as the sole target in assessing the health risk from ingested cadmium. The data also question the validity of incorporating the default 5% absorption rate in the threshold-type risk assessment model, known as the provisional tolerable weekly intake (PTWI), to derive a safe intake level for cadmium. Because of its high rates of soil-to-plant transfer, cadmium is a contaminant found in most human foodstuffs, which renders diet a primary source of exposure among nonsmoking, nonoccupationally exposed populations (Clemens 2006; Franz et al. 2008; McLaughlin et al. 2006). A safe intake limit of 7 μg cadmium/week/kg body weight was set based on the critical renal cadmium concentration of between 100 and 200 μg/g wet weight that corresponds to a urinary threshold limit of 5–10 μg/g creatinine [World Health Organization (WHO) 1989, 1993]. However, numerous studies have revealed adverse kidney effects at urinary cadmium levels &lt; 0.5 μg/g creatinine (Satarug and Moore 2004). Further, accumulating evidence links environmental exposure to cadmium with increased cancer incidence. For example, in prospective studies in Japan and the United States, excess cancer mortality was found to be associated with environmental exposure to cadmium (Arisawa et al. 2007b; Menke et al. 2009; Nishijo et al. 2006). Åkesson et al. (2008) observed increased endometrial cancer risk in a Swedish cohort among participants who consumed &gt; 15 μg/day of cadmium, mainly from cereals and vegetables. These findings suggest a very large health burden associated with exposure to cadmium at levels experienced by many populations worldwide. This review provides an update on cadmium exposure levels and the potential adverse health effects they may elicit in adult populations. We focus first on key issues underpinning health risk assessment of low-level cadmium in the diet, including bioavailability of dietary origin, the 5% default absorption rate, thresholds and safe intake levels, and the kidney as a specific target for cadmium accumulation. Second, we review epidemiologic studies from 2004 to 2009 that link exposure levels to observed effects in classic targets (kidney and bone) along with newly identified potential target organs. We also summarize evidence that links cadmium with diabetes, diabetic nephropathy, hypertension, peripheral artery disease (PAD), myocardial infarction, diminished lung function, periodontal disease, and age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Evidence from prospective studies reveal potential causal relationships of cadmium exposure with life prognosis (all-cause mortality) and excess cancer mortality and suggest that cadmium is at least a comorbidity factor if not a causative factor. Specifically, we summarize cadmium-cancer associations for the lung, pancreas, breast, endometrium, prostate, and urinary bladder.

        Our in silico study has explored the possible chemopreventive mechanism of these phytochemicals against the NF-κB precursor protein p105 and deciphered that quercetin, 1-caffeoylquinic acid and guggulsterone were the potent inhibitors against target molecule. In addition, large scale preclinical and clinical trials are needed to explore the role of these chemotherapeutic molecules against the NF-κB precursor protein p105 in cure and prevention of breast cancer.

        Dietary LC n-3 PUFAs appear protective for aggressive prostate cancer, and this effect is modified by the COX-2 SNP rs4648310. Our findings support the hypothesis that LC n-3 may impact prostate inflammation and carcinogenesis through the COX-2 enzymatic pathway.

        Serum CK levels in cases was significantly lower compared with controls. Notably, our results indicated for the first time that there was a negative correlation between serum CK levels and breast cancer stage. Serum CK level, which may reflect the status of host immunity, may be an important factor in determining breast cancer development and progression.

        Lean fish consumption of 75–100 g/d had a beneficial effect on T2DM. It remains unclear whether lean fish in itself has a protective effect on T2DM or that lean fish consumers have a protective life-style that we were not able to take into account in this study. Unfavorable effects of fatty fish consumption or use of cod liver oil supplements on T2DM were not observed.
