        Our study provides additional support for the hypothesis that a dietary pattern rich in fruit and salad might protect against invasive breast cancer and that the effect might be stronger for ER- and PR-negative tumours. Most of the studies on the risk of breast cancer in relation to individual foods and nutrients have had inconsistent results (Michels et al, 2007). Dietary pattern analysis is an increasingly common alternative approach for examining the relationship between diet and the risk of disease or biomarkers of disease (Newby and Tucker, 2004). Factor analysis applied to dietary data produces a few patterns of dietary intake that represent underlying independent dimensions of food and nutrient consumption. The assessment of dietary patterns in this way overcomes limitations of the single food or nutrient approach (Newby and Tucker, 2004). Two recent systematic literature reviews (Edefonti et al, 2009; Brennan et al, 2010) found consistent evidence that a ‘prudent&#x27;/‘healthy&#x27; dietary pattern was associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer. Breast cancer, similar to most cancers, is heterogeneous in its pathology, natural history and response to treatment. Breast cancer differ, for example, with respect to oestrogen (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) status; hormone receptor-positive cancers exhibiting better differentiated morphological appearance and stronger clinical response to hormonal treatment (Althuis et al, 2004). There is evidence to suggest that risk factors (Colditz et al, 2004), including food items (Olsen et al, 2003; Stripp et al, 2003; Suzuki et al, 2005; Zhang et al, 2005; Cho et al, 2006) and dietary patterns (Fung et al, 2005; Velie et al, 2005; Agurs-Collins et al, 2009) differ in their association by tumour receptor status. Using data from the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study (MCCS), we analyze the effect of dietary patterns on breast cancer risk overall, by attained age during follow-up and by tumour characteristics, including tumour grade and ER and PR status.

        Findings suggest that intake of green tea may modify estrogen metabolism or conjugation and in this way may influence breast cancer risk.

        These findings are consistent with a beneficial effect of choline and betaine intakes on carcinogenesis. Although nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a rare neoplasm in most regions of the world (an incidence of &lt;1 per 105 person-years), particularly high incidences have been observed in southern China, especially in the province of Guangdong (20–50 per 105 person-years) (Jia et al, 2006; Bray et al, 2008). According to statistical data reported by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, 33 101 new cases of NPC were diagnosed in China in 2008, accounting for ∼40% of new cases worldwide (Ferlay et al, 2008). Most of these cases occurred in persons 40–59 years of age and thus have the potential for enormous social devastation (Lee et al, 2003). Therefore, preventive strategies would have substantial benefit in this region. Development of NPC depends on the interaction between genetic susceptibility and environmental factors (for example, Epstein–Barr virus infection, exposure to carcinogens, dietary factors) (Lee et al, 2003). With the exception of salted fish (Lee et al, 2003), the role of dietary components is poorly understood. Choline is an essential nutrient widely distributed in animals and plants (Laird and Jaenisch, 1994). Although choline is endogenously synthesised, a choline-deficient diet leads to deficiency in humans (Zeisel et al, 1991). Choline is oxidised to betaine, which is linked to folate and serves as a methyl donor in one-carbon metabolism to affect the DNA methylation level in vivo (Laird and Jaenisch, 1994). DNA methylation is postulated to have an important role in carcinogenesis (Laird and Jaenisch, 1994). Deficiencies in dietary choline and betaine could increase the probability of hypomethylation independent of folate levels (Shin et al, 2010) and predispose an individual to the development of neoplasia. Recent epidemiological studies have revealed an inverse association between choline and/or betaine intake and several types of cancers such as breast cancer (Xu et al, 2009; Zhang et al, 2013), lung cancer (Ying et al, 2013) and oesophageal cancer (Ibiebele et al, 2011). From the results of these studies, it is reasonable to speculate that choline and/or betaine intake affects the risk of NPC. However, to our knowledge, there has been no epidemiological study pertaining to the association between dietary choline and/or betaine intake and the risk of NPC. Therefore, the primary goal of our study was to investigate whether intake of dietary choline and/or betaine has protective effects on the risk of NPC in a Chinese population. We also examined the modification of the effect by some potential risk factors, such as folate intake and alcohol consumption, because these factors might interact with choline to alter methylation levels (Cho et al, 2007b).
