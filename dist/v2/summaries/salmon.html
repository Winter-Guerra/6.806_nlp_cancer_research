        The addition of 1 year of adjuvant trastuzumab significantly improved disease-free and overall survival among women with HER2-positive breast cancer. The risk–benefit ratio favored the nonanthracycline TCH regimen over AC-T plus trastuzumab, given its similar efficacy, fewer acute toxic effects, and lower risks of cardiotoxicity and leukemia. (Funded by Sanofi-Aventis and Genentech; BCIRG-006 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00021255.) The her2 gene encodes a tyrosine kinase receptor that mediates critical signaling functions in normal and malignant breast epithelial cells.1 An acquired alteration consisting of amplification and overexpression of the gene product occurs in approximately 20 to 25% of human breast cancers.2,3 HER2 overexpression is associated with an aggressive clinical pheno-type that includes high-grade tumors, increased growth rates, early systemic metastasis, and decreased rates of disease-free and overall survival.2,3 Preclinical data indicate that this adverse clinical picture results from fundamental changes in the biologic features of breast-cancer cells containing the alteration, including increased proliferation, suppression of apoptosis, increased motility, greater invasive and metastatic potential, accelerated angiogenesis, and steroid hormone independence.4–11 In previous studies, many of these HER2-mediated adverse characteristics were reversed by the use of monoclonal antibodies directed against the tyrosine kinase receptor,10,12–15 and these data led to phase 1 testing of a murine anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody, 4D5.16 Preliminary efficacy and safety data prompted the development of a humanized monoclonal antibody to produce trastuzumab.17 Alone and in combination with chemotherapy, trastuzumab has been shown to have an acceptable safety record and to be active in advanced HER2-positive disease.18–20 Subsequently, in a large, randomized study, the addition of trastuzumab to chemotherapy yielded significant improvements in rates of objective response, response duration, and time to disease progression (56%, 58%, and 65% improvement, respectively), as well as a 30% improvement in the rate of overall survival among patients with first-line metastatic disease.21 A significant side effect was an increase by a factor of 4 in the rate of cardiac dysfunction, including congestive heart failure, especially when trastuzumab was used in combination with anthracycline-based regimens.21 These data led to the initial regulatory approval of trastuzumab for metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer and resulted in its evaluation in early-stage disease. Five randomized trials (four large and one small) were then launched to evaluate the efficacy and safety of adjuvant therapy with trastuzumab, and findings in three of these trials have been reported.22–24 One report contained results from similar treatment groups in two studies.23 All three large studies used trastuzumab in combination either exclusively or predominantly with anthracycline-based regimens,22,23 and all showed a significant benefit of trastuzumab, with a reduction in the rate of recurrence of approximately 50% and improvement in the rate of survival of approximately 30%.22,23 Again, an increase by a factor of 4 to 5 in the rate of congestive heart failure was noted when adjuvant trastuzumab was used with anthracyclines, and an even larger proportion of patients had subclinical loss of left ventricular function.22,23,25,26 In the fourth large study, the Breast Cancer International Research Group 006 (BCIRG-006) trial, we also evaluated adjuvant therapy with trastuzumab but included a second trastuzumab-containing regimen, which did not have an anthracycline. This new regimen, consisting of docetaxel, carboplatin, and trastuzumab (TCH), is based on preclinical synergies observed between trastuzumab and platinum salts or docetaxel that were not seen with anthracyclines or paclitaxel.14,27,28 It was also anticipated that TCH might circumvent the cardiac toxicity seen with anthracycline-based regimens.21 Phase 2 and 3 trials of TCH in patients with advanced disease showed that this regimen resulted in the longest period of progression-free survival reported to date, with rare cardiac dysfunction.18–20 A trial comparing TCH with docetaxel plus trastuzumab in metastatic disease showed no significant difference in progression-free survival between these two regimens.29 However, the dose of docetaxel was 33% higher in the group receiving docetaxel plus trastuzumab than in the group receiving TCH (100 mg per square meter of body-surface area vs. 75 mg per square meter). The only trial that directly evaluated the added benefit of carboplatin in a dose-equivalent, taxane-containing regimen showed that TCH had a significant advantage with respect to progression-free survival over paclitaxel plus trastuzumab.19 For these reasons, we decided to evaluate TCH in addition to an anthracycline-based regimen in adjuvant treatment of HER2-positive breast cancers. We report efficacy and safety results from this study in an intention-to-treat analysis of data from all 3222 patients.

        Surgeons and patients agreed strikingly about the purposes of information and indicated that giving information is a more complex task than current recommendations imply. We suggest that expert recommendations should catch up with practice rather than the reverse. That is, if recommendations are to reflect patients&#x27; real rather than assumed needs, and be realistic about how surgeons can meet these needs, the recommendations should be informed by knowledge of how patients and surgeons already reconcile these needs in clinical practice.

        Adjuvant liver surgery allowed discontinuation of chemotherapy in 46% of cases and, in this highly selected patient group, allowed good quality prolonged survival. It could be included in multicentre treatment protocols for controlled BCLM, one arm with prolonged chemotherapy, one with adjuvant liver surgery. Copyright 2000 Harcourt Publishers Ltd.

        The discriminatory performance of existing prediction models for de novo metastatic breast cancer in Asia is modest. Development of an Asian-specific prediction model is needed to improve prognostication and guide decision making.

        This survey confirms the prognosis role of obesity on one of the largest cohort by investigating several prognosis events. While independent obesity effect linked to hormonal disorders appeared consistent as obesity&#x27;s mechanism, we stress that obesity prognosis effect was also related to breast cancer presentation at diagnosis time.
