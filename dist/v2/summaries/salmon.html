        Surgeons and patients agreed strikingly about the purposes of information and indicated that giving information is a more complex task than current recommendations imply. We suggest that expert recommendations should catch up with practice rather than the reverse. That is, if recommendations are to reflect patients&#x27; real rather than assumed needs, and be realistic about how surgeons can meet these needs, the recommendations should be informed by knowledge of how patients and surgeons already reconcile these needs in clinical practice.

        Adjuvant liver surgery allowed discontinuation of chemotherapy in 46% of cases and, in this highly selected patient group, allowed good quality prolonged survival. It could be included in multicentre treatment protocols for controlled BCLM, one arm with prolonged chemotherapy, one with adjuvant liver surgery. Copyright 2000 Harcourt Publishers Ltd.

        The discriminatory performance of existing prediction models for de novo metastatic breast cancer in Asia is modest. Development of an Asian-specific prediction model is needed to improve prognostication and guide decision making.

        This survey confirms the prognosis role of obesity on one of the largest cohort by investigating several prognosis events. While independent obesity effect linked to hormonal disorders appeared consistent as obesity&#x27;s mechanism, we stress that obesity prognosis effect was also related to breast cancer presentation at diagnosis time.
