        We observed no association between total fruit and vegetable intake and risk of overall
breast cancer. However, vegetable consumption was inversely associated with risk of
ER− breast cancer in our large pooled analyses. Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease. Expression of the estrogen receptor (ER) can be
used to explain, in part, some of the differences in etiology, and clinical characteristics of
breast cancer and survival rates among breast cancer patients (1–3). Breast tumors that express the ER (ER+
tumors) are more strongly associated with hormone-related factors than tumors that do not
express the ER (ER− tumors). Classic risk factors, such as late age at first
birth and number of births, are more consistently associated with risk of
ER+ breast cancer than with risk of ER− breast cancer
(1). In addition, few risk factors have been
identified for ER− breast cancer. Fruit and vegetable intake has been hypothesized to reduce the risk of
breast cancer, but the current evidence is inconclusive. A recent meta-analysis of 14 cohort
studies reported a statistically significant 11% reduced risk of breast cancer overall
comparing high vs low fruit and vegetable intake; results were not reported for breast cancer
subtypes defined by receptor status (4). Three
cohort studies (5–7) have recently
investigated the association between fruit and vegetable intake and risk of breast cancer by
receptor status. All three studies found that women who consumed higher levels of fruits and
vegetables had a 32% to 50% lower risk of ER− breast cancer compared with
women who consumed low levels of fruits and vegetables. In another cohort study that evaluated
only dietary patterns, women consuming a high fruit or salad pattern were observed to have a
45% lower risk of ER− breast cancer (8). Because the number of studies examining ER− breast cancer is
limited, more evidence is needed to examine the role of diet in ER− breast
cancer. One challenge in examining ER− breast cancer in
epidemiologic studies is that ER− breast cancer accounts for only 15% to 20%
of breast cancers (9). Thus, in most studies, the
number of ER− breast cancer case patients is relatively low, which affects
the power to detect modest associations with certainty. Therefore, with the advantage of a large number of case patients, we
evaluated the relation between fruit and vegetable consumption and risk of breast cancer by ER
status in a pooled analysis of 20 prospective cohorts. These analyses expand our prior
analyses of fruit and vegetable consumption and breast cancer risk (10) by including 12 more prospective studies and increasing the
follow-up time for most of the studies in the original analyses. In addition, only two of the
20 studies in this pooled analysis have previously examined associations specifically with
fruit and vegetable consumption and risk of ER− breast cancer (5, 6). In
secondary analyses, we examined tumors classified by progesterone receptor (PR) status.

        In general, the dietary patterns showed consistent results across the three cohorts except for the possible protective effect of PPP in the NLCS cohort, which could be explained by a difference in that pattern for NLCS. The results supported the suggestion derived from traditional epidemiology that relatively recent diet may not have an important role in the etiology of breast cancer.

        High dietary intakes of plant lignans and high exposure to enterolignans were associated with reduced risks of ER- and PR-positive postmenopausal breast cancer in a Western population that does not consume a diet rich in soy. Phytoestrogens are naturally occurring compounds that are found in plants and in most foods of plant origin. Phytoestrogens consist mainly of isoflavones, which are found in high concentrations in soy and legumes, and lignans, which are found in a variety of fruits, vegetables, and cereal products. Because phytoestrogens have a chemical structure that is similar to that of 17 β-estradiol, they may compete with estrogens for binding to estrogen receptors (ERs) and in so doing, may act as weak estrogen agonists or antagonists (1). Therefore, phytoestrogens have been hypothesized to behave like selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) and to play a role in the chemoprevention of breast cancer (1). However, despite 15 years of epidemiologic research, the possible association between dietary intake of phytoestrogens and the risk of breast cancer remains unclear. Initially, results from international comparisons and studies of migrant populations gave rise to the hypothesis that higher intakes of soy, a primary source of isoflavones, might be associated with a decreased risk of breast cancer (2, 3). Subsequent case–control and cohort studies (4) conducted in Asia generally confirmed that a high consumption of soy-based foods and isoflavones is associated with a lower risk of premenopausal breast cancer, especially if exposure occurs early in life, for instance, during adolescence. However, studies conducted in North America and Europe have been less conclusive than the Asian studies (4). Indeed, they were inconsistent with each other in showing an association between Western intake levels ofisofl avones and breast cancer risk, but they suggested a possibly reduced risk of breast cancer associated with lignan intakes (5, 6). Moreover, limited evidence is available on exposure to the bioactive metabolites of lignans, the enterolignans, which derive from the metabolism of ingested lignans by the gut microflora and are absorbed by the intestinal cells into the circulation (7). To date, 10 biomarker studies (six prospective studies and four case–control studies) have investigated the relationship between circulating or excreted levels of enterolignans and the risk of postmenopausal breast cancer. Among the prospective studies, five (8–12) found no association and one (6) found that a higher plasma level of enterolignans was associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer. The four case–control studies showed a statistically significant inverse association (13–15) or a suggestive trend for an inverse association (16) between higher serum or urinary levels of enterolignans and the risk of postmenopausal breast cancer. Large prospective studies of dietary lignan intake in relation to breast cancer risk are still scarce, and further research is needed to clarify the potential associations of lignans and enterolignans with breast cancer risk.

        Regular consumption of select deep-fried foods is associated with increased PCa risk. Whether this risk is specific to deep-fried foods, or whether it represents risk associated with regular intake of foods exposed to high heat and/or other aspects of the Western lifestyle, such as fast food consumption, remains to be determined.

        Although the exact mechanism is not clear, replacing two thirds of staple food with yam for 30 days improves the status of sex hormones, lipids, and antioxidants. These effects might reduce the risk of breast cancer and cardiovascular diseases in postmenopausal women.

        This study does not support the hypothesis that dietary cadmium intake is a risk factor for breast cancer. However, non-differential measurement error in the estimate of cadmium intake is likely the most important factor that could have obscured an association. Cadmium is a toxic and carcinogenic heavy metal released into the environment as a result of industrial and agricultural activities[1, 2]. Historically, most research on the health effects of cadmium has focused on occupational exposure[3]. However, chronic non-occupational exposure to cadmium is common. Cadmium is taken up from contaminated soil by tobacco, grains, and a variety of vegetables[4–7]. Cadmium inhaled with cigarette smoke is readily absorbed by lung tissue[8]. Although only approximately 5% of cadmium ingested in food is absorbed, cadmium absorption is potentiated by low iron stores, and it may be in part for this reason that women are consistently observed to have higher average urine and blood cadmium concentrations[9, 10]. Cadmium, once absorbed from the environment, is retained throughout the body, including in breast tissue for decades[8, 11–13]. Multiple mechanisms potentially link cadmium to carcinogenesis including oxidative stress and inflammation[14, 15], interference with DNA repair[16, 17], and alterations of DNA methylation[18]. Intriguing laboratory evidence suggests that cadmium may act on estrogenic signaling pathways[19, 20], stimulating proliferation of breast cancer cells in culture[21], and inducing increased uterus and mammary gland weight in rats[22]. Further evidence specifically shows that low level, long term cadmium can malignantly transform breast cells, albeit through pathways independent of estrogen receptor(α)[23]. Cadmium has been linked to lung cancer in occupational settings[24, 25], although uncertainty remains[26]. In non-occupationally exposed populations, cadmium has also been associated with lung cancer incidence and mortality[27, 28]. Because of the laboratory data potentially linking cadmium with estrogen signaling pathways, cadmium has received increasing attention as a risk factor for hormone-related cancers in women. Prospective studies in Sweden observed an association between dietary cadmium and risk of breast cancer[29] and endometrial cancer[30], but not ovarian cancer[31]. In the United States, two case-control studies observed consistent strong associations between urine cadmium and breast cancer risk[32, 33]. This report describes our prospective study of dietary cadmium intake and postmenopausal, invasive breast cancer risk in the VItamins And Lifestyle (VITAL) cohort.

        Our study provides additional support for the hypothesis that a dietary pattern rich in fruit and salad might protect against invasive breast cancer and that the effect might be stronger for ER- and PR-negative tumours. Most of the studies on the risk of breast cancer in relation to individual foods and nutrients have had inconsistent results (Michels et al, 2007). Dietary pattern analysis is an increasingly common alternative approach for examining the relationship between diet and the risk of disease or biomarkers of disease (Newby and Tucker, 2004). Factor analysis applied to dietary data produces a few patterns of dietary intake that represent underlying independent dimensions of food and nutrient consumption. The assessment of dietary patterns in this way overcomes limitations of the single food or nutrient approach (Newby and Tucker, 2004). Two recent systematic literature reviews (Edefonti et al, 2009; Brennan et al, 2010) found consistent evidence that a ‘prudent&#x27;/‘healthy&#x27; dietary pattern was associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer. Breast cancer, similar to most cancers, is heterogeneous in its pathology, natural history and response to treatment. Breast cancer differ, for example, with respect to oestrogen (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) status; hormone receptor-positive cancers exhibiting better differentiated morphological appearance and stronger clinical response to hormonal treatment (Althuis et al, 2004). There is evidence to suggest that risk factors (Colditz et al, 2004), including food items (Olsen et al, 2003; Stripp et al, 2003; Suzuki et al, 2005; Zhang et al, 2005; Cho et al, 2006) and dietary patterns (Fung et al, 2005; Velie et al, 2005; Agurs-Collins et al, 2009) differ in their association by tumour receptor status. Using data from the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study (MCCS), we analyze the effect of dietary patterns on breast cancer risk overall, by attained age during follow-up and by tumour characteristics, including tumour grade and ER and PR status.

        Our findings suggest that dietary vitamin C intake before breast cancer diagnosis may be associated with breast cancer survival. In addition, post-diagnosis vitamin C supplementation at the level observed in our population was not associated with survival. Vitamin C is a water-soluble nutrient that has been hypothesised to influence cancer initiation and promotion through its antioxidant properties including the neutralization of free radicals (Frei, 1994; Willcox et al, 2004). In addition, in vitro experiments have shown cytotoxic action of vitamin C against cancer cells without subsequent toxicity to normal cells (Chen et al, 2008; Ullah et al, 2011). However, the evidence from observational epidemiologic studies on vitamin C intake and survival following breast cancer diagnosis is not consistent, with dietary vitamin C intake reported to reduce the risk of mortality in some studies (Rohan et al, 1993; Ingram, 1994; Jain et al, 1994; Fleischauer et al, 2003; McEligot et al, 2006) and no association in other studies (Zhang et al, 1995; Hebert et al, 1998; Holmes et al, 1999; Saxe et al, 1999; Saquib et al, 2011). In addition, the safety of oral vitamin C supplements following cancer diagnosis is not clear (Lawenda et al, 2008) and few studies have examined vitamin C supplements in relation to breast cancer survival (Greenlee et al, 2009; Nechuta et al, 2011; Greenlee et al, 2012). The aim of this study was to investigate whether pre-diagnosis dietary vitamin C intake was associated with total and breast cancer-specific mortality among women diagnosed with invasive breast cancer in the Swedish Mammography Cohort (SMC). We also examined whether the association between vitamin C and survival differed by hormone receptor status, disease stage at diagnosis, age, body mass index (BMI) and smoking. In a subset of women, we examined whether vitamin C supplement intake following breast cancer diagnosis was associated with survival.

        In addition to lifestyle and socioeconomic factors, health-related factors like smoking and diabetes were found to influence potato consumption. The high potato consumption group had an especially high consumption of fish and a low consumption of pasta/rice, though the nutrient density in the groups was similar. The potato was introduced in Norway in the mid-1700s. Potato growing had its breakthrough during the war in 1807–1808, and it became an extremely important contributor in terms of food security and poverty alleviation (1). Today boiled potatoes, together with meat or fish, vegetables and gravy, are a central component of a Norwegian supper (2, 3) and are an important source of fibre, niacin, folate, and vitamin C (4, 5). Despite its role as a nutrient-rich staple food, there has been a drastic decline in the consumption of potatoes, particularly boiled potatoes, in Norway over the past 40 years (2, 6). This follows a similar trend that has been taking place in most Northern and Central European countries (2). Potatoes have a high glycaemic index and load (7–9), which might be one reason why they have fallen into disrepute. Due to the dramatic effect potatoes have on blood sugar and insulin secretion, several researchers in nutrition have put potatoes on top of their food pyramid as a food that should be eaten only occasionally (10). Studies have shown that diets with low glycaemic index and/or low glycaemic load are associated with a reduced risk of several chronic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and several cancers (11). Reviews of studies on potato consumption and human health have reported beneficial associations between potatoes and cardiometabolic health (5) and several cancers (12). However, studies on the long-term cancer-related health effects of potato consumption are lacking (12). There is also a lack of clinical trial data on the impact of potatoes on weight management, and the results of several cohort studies carried out on this topic are contradictory (5). Contradictory results have also been reported regarding potato consumption and diabetes (12). Potatoes are usually eaten as part of a meal, and therefore the impact potatoes have on disease risk may depend on the foods they are grouped with in a dietary pattern (5). Previous studies have shown that age, area of residence, income, education and household structure are important determinants of potato consumption (2, 4, 13). The aim of this study is to gain a better understanding of which factors influence potato consumption among women in the Norwegian Women and Cancer (NOWAC) study, and which potential confounders should be considered in future studies of potato consumption and health outcomes.
