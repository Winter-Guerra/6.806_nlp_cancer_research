        We meta-analyzed more and newer research results, and separated women according to menopausal status to explore soy isoflavone-breast cancer association. We founded that soy isoflavone intake could lower the risk of breast cancer for both pre- and post-menopausal women in Asian countries. However, for women in Western countries, pre- or post-menopausal, there is no evidence to suggest an association between intake of soy isoflavone and breast cancer.

        This prospective study suggests that consumption of soy food has no protective effects against breast cancer. Further large-scale investigations eliciting genetic factors may clarify different roles of various soybean-ingredient foods on the risk of breast cancer.

        Among women with breast cancer, soy food consumption was significantly associated with decreased risk of death and recurrence.

        These findings contribute to our understanding of the level of soy intake among women at increased risk for breast cancer and highlight potential factors that may influence women&#x27;s decisions regarding soy food consumption. Women, particularly in this vulnerable population, would benefit from clear messages regarding the health effects of soy.
