        Gene expression associated with soy intake and high plasma genistein defines a signature characterized by overexpression of FGFR2 and genes that drive cell cycle and proliferation pathways. These findings raise the concerns that in a subset of women soy could adversely affect gene expression in breast cancer. © The Author 2014. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

        Among women with breast cancer, soy food consumption was significantly associated with decreased risk of death and recurrence.

        The naturally occurring dietary intake of soy food or its components appears safe for women without breast cancer; however, the safety of high supplements of soy or its components is less certain.

        Soy consumption may be associated with reduced risk of breast cancer incidence, recurrence, and mortality. Soy does not have estrogenic effects in humans. Soy intake consistent with a traditional Japanese diet appears safe for breast cancer survivors. While there is no clear evidence of harm, better evidence confirming safety is required before use of high dose (≥100mg) isoflavones can be recommended for breast cancer patients.

        A six-month intervention of mixed soy isoflavones in healthy, high risk adult western women did not reduce breast epithelial proliferation, suggesting a lack of efficacy for breast cancer prevention, and a possible adverse effect in premenopausal women.

        According to the meta-analysis of studies conducted in Asian countries, soy food intake is inversely associated with the risk of breast cancer among Asian women, especially based on the results of meta-analysis of case-control studies.

        We meta-analyzed more and newer research results, and separated women according to menopausal status to explore soy isoflavone-breast cancer association. We founded that soy isoflavone intake could lower the risk of breast cancer for both pre- and post-menopausal women in Asian countries. However, for women in Western countries, pre- or post-menopausal, there is no evidence to suggest an association between intake of soy isoflavone and breast cancer.

        Dietary soy isoflavones promote breast cancer at low oestrogen levels but inhibit breast cancer at high oestrogen levels. This effect may only occur during the initiation stage of breast cancer.

        The use of soy isoflavones to promote health in breast cancer survivors remains controversial because of scant scientific data.

        Genistein and daidzein may stimulate existing breast tumor growth and antagonize the effects of tamoxifen. Women with current or past breast cancer should be aware of the risks of potential tumor growth when taking soy products.

      <li>
        Soy isoflavones consumed at levels comparable to those in Asian populations may reduce the risk of cancer recurrence in women receiving tamoxifen therapy and moreover, appears not to interfere with tamoxifen efficacy. Further confirmation is required in other large prospective studies before recommendations regarding soy intake can be issued to breast cancer survivors.
