        A major novelty of our study was the use of a statistical method that correctly accounts for the intra-SAGE and inter-SAGE library sources of variation. The most useful result of applying this modified t statistics beta binomial test is the identification of genes and gene families commonly deregulated across samples within each specific stage in the transition from normal to preinvasive and invasive stages of breast cancer development. Most of the gene expression abnormalities detected at the in situ stage were related to specific genes in charge of regulating the proper homeostasis between cell death and cell proliferation. The comparison of in situ lesions with fully invasive lesions, a much more heterogeneous group, clearly identified as the most importantly deregulated group of transcripts those encoding for various families of proteins in charge of extracellular matrix remodeling, invasion and cell motility functions.

        The integration of the breast cancer comparative transcriptome analysis based on ERα status coupled to the genome-wide identification of high-affinity EREs and GO over-representation analysis, provide useful information for validation and discovery of signaling networks related to estrogen response in this malignancy.

        Our analysis leads to the unexpected and remarkable suggestion that ER, PR, and HER2 status, or molecular subtype classification, do not provide additional prognostic value when the values of the FGD3-SUSD3 and attractor metagenes are taken into consideration.

        Stereotactic core needle biopsy is the diagnostic procedure of choice for most mammographic abnormalities. However, for patients undergoing lumpectomy without axillary surgery, it is an extra invasive procedure that does not facilitate obtaining negative margins. Stereotactic core needle biopsy (SCNB) has been widely accepted as an alternative to wire localization and surgical excision of nonpalpable breast abnormalities. For the woman with a benign breast lesion, the elimination of a surgical procedure, with its associated complications and cost, is a clear benefit of this approach. For the woman with carcinoma, who will require a surgical procedure for therapy, the benefit of an initial SCNB varies, depending on how accurately the procedure characterizes the malignant lesion and allows definitive therapy with a single surgical procedure. The use of SCNB clearly saves money when only the cost of diagnosis is considered, 1,2 although cost savings vary with the type of lesion being sampled. 2 Few studies have examined the relative benefits of SCNB and surgical biopsy to the completion of local therapy, and studies that have used this end point consist of relatively few, highly selected patients, 3–5 making them unlikely to have the power to identify a subgroup of patients who do not benefit from SCNB. This prospective study was undertaken to determine whether SCNB is the diagnostic procedure of choice for all mammographic abnormalities deemed suspicious enough to require histologic sampling. The number of surgical procedures to the completion of local therapy was the end point chosen because the need for multiple surgical procedures is a cause of physical, cosmetic, and psychological problems for the patient, as well as the major determinant of cost.

        Women vary in the extent to which they define themselves in terms of the breast cancer experience. Survivor centrality in and of itself is not always indicative of adjustment to disease. When women have a more negative view of being a breast cancer survivor, survivor centrality is more likely to signify potential problems. Scientists in the area of psycho-oncology have been studying women’s adjustment to the diagnosis and treatment of cancer for several decades now (1–4). With the improvement in early detection procedures and the development of more effective treatments, the prognosis for breast cancer has improved dramatically. Thus, researchers have begun to examine survivorship issues. Whereas most studies show that survivors, on average, do not show elevated levels of general distress, such as anxiety or depression, compared to healthy controls or population norms (5–7), moderate levels of cancer-specific worries persist (8). General quality of life measures do not capture the subtleties in long-term survivorship (7). With time, stress related to the diagnosis and treatment of cancer diminishes and some of the memories associated with the trauma wane, but other sources of stress persist. Survivorship issues have centered on fears of recurrence, the long-term effects of treatment, concerns about a shortened life span, impact on body image, practical issues of employability and insurance (8–12), and, finally, the consequences of having had cancer for one’s self-concept. It is the impact of cancer on the self-concept that is the subject of the present study. The diagnosis and treatment for cancer leads to the development of a new social role—the role of cancer survivor—and that role persists for the rest of one’s life (13). That is, cancer is not an acute, discrete event with a defined ending, but a process that extends for the rest of the lifespan (14,15). Regardless of the type of cancer, the severity of disease, or the length of survival, cancer survivors need to figure out how cancer changes the self and what its implications are for daily life. According to Zebrack (13), the way that cancer survivors see themselves in relation to the world has consequences for their well-being. However, little is known about how or whether people integrate cancer into their self-concept, distinguish those who do integrate cancer into their self-concept from those who do not, and understand the implications of a cancer self-concept for quality of life (13). The purpose of the present research is to examine the extent to which breast cancer is central to 10-year survivors’ identity (i.e., survivor centrality), to examine the determinants of survivor centrality, and to determine if survivor centrality is associated with positive or negative indices of well-being. There are many dimensions of illness that have been explored by previous research, such as the perception of an illness’s consequences, perceptions of personal control over illness, and attributions for illness (16–18). There also are aspects of illness self-concept that have been assessed, including the extent to which one feels good about the self and the stigma associated with illness (19,20). Researchers often ask one of two questions. First, how does cancer affect one’s self-concept, typically operationalized as self-esteem (21,22)? Second, how do aspects of self-concept affect adjustment to cancer (19,23)? One study examined illness self-concepts by asking women who had undergone bone marrow transplants (BMT) to rate a person who has had a bone marrow transplant on a set of items and then to rate themselves on the same set of items (24). Correspondence between the two sets of descriptors was considered to reflect BMT self-concept. BMT self-concept was related to greater distress, as indicated by more intrusive thoughts about the illness. However, none of these studies seem to address the extent to which an illness is integrated into the self, or survivor centrality. Despite the lack of research on survivor centrality, health care professionals have learned that the integration of an illness, or surviving an illness, into one’s identity is a theme that emerges from discussions with cancer survivors. In a qualitative study of adult survivors of childhood cancer, survivors frequently discussed the extent to which the cancer came to identify themselves (25). In another interview study of adult survivors of childhood cancer, some individuals said that they defined themselves in terms of the cancer and saw the cancer as integral to their self (26). In one study, 15 men and women with a history of cancer were interviewed and issues of identity and changes in identity were explored (27). For some of the people, survivorship was a defining part of their identities (“I am a survivor”). In her research on chronic illness, Charmaz (28) discusses the extent to which people incorporate the illness into their self-concepts, distinguishing between people who define themselves in terms of the illness and people who try to separate the illness from the rest of their lives. Wiebe et al. (29) suggested that the impact of illness centrality on health outcomes would depend on the individual’s attitude toward the illness, that is, whether the individual perceives the illness in positive or negative terms. In a study of children with diabetes, they predicted and found that the centrality of diabetes was related to more depressive symptoms and poor metabolic control only when the illness was perceived in highly negative terms. In another study of adolescents with diabetes, this pattern of findings was replicated—but only for females (30). In the case of breast cancer, will women’s attitude toward having had this disease be positive or negative? Research shows that people without cancer tend to have more negative perceptions of cancer and stigmatize the illness more than people with cancer (31). This is partly due to the negative portrayal of cancer and exaggeration of the consequences of cancer by the media (32). Studies have shown that women without breast cancer perceive cancer as less controllable and overestimate the negative consequences (physical, social, economic) compared to women with breast cancer (33,34). This is one of the reasons that cancer is stigmatized (35). Cancer also is stigmatized because it is an illness that is poorly understood, greatly feared, and evokes images of mortality (35–37). Several studies have shown that people without cancer tend to make more internal attributions and less chance attributions than people with cancer (33,34), most likely because locating the blame within another person removes the threat to the self. Thus, one author concluded that people with cancer end up being stigmatized for having cancer and for causing cancer (34). However, the heightened survivorship from cancer has led to a decrease in the stigma attached to cancer (15). There is a body of research that suggests cancer survivors perceive the illness in positive terms, in part by experiencing positive changes from the illness (38). This literature has come to be known as benefit-finding, stress-related growth, and post-traumatic growth (39). Persons with cancer commonly report an enhanced appreciation of life, closer relationships, increased spirituality, a shift in priorities, and increased personal strength (38). In terms of identities, a study of women under active treatment for cancer showed that many women described themselves in positive terms that they would not have ascribed to themselves prior to the cancer, such as “strong” and “fighter” (40). An emerging controversy in that literature is the extent to which these reported positive experiences are actual or illusory (41,52). What are the implications of defining oneself in terms of an illness or illness survivorship for adjustment to disease? Is it psychologically adaptive to view cancer survivorship as part of the self, or to place having had cancer in the past and separate it from the self? Are the breast cancer survivors who seem to identify themselves with surviving the illness by wearing pink ribbons, openly discussing their illness experience with newly diagnosed women, and participating in breast cancer activities better or worse off for having adopted these attitudes and behaviors? One might believe that these women are successfully adjusting to their disease because they are confronting it rather than denying it. However, one also could suggest that these women have not accepted their disease, are constantly reliving it, and are unable to put it behind them and move on with their lives. To the extent that having had breast cancer is viewed as a stigmatizing condition, the stigma literature predicts that survivor centrality will be related to more psychosocial difficulties (42). However, from the previous literature it is not clear that cancer survivors today view cancer as a stigmatizing condition. There were three goals of the present study. First, we described the extent to which having had breast cancer is integrated into survivors’ self-concept versus segregated from the rest of their lives. The survivors are 10 years post diagnosis, making this study unique as most survivorship studies do not exceed 5 years (7). Second, we determined whether there are certain groups of women who are more or less likely to perceive themselves in terms of cancer survivorship by examining whether demographic or medical variables predict survivor centrality. One might expect that women who were diagnosed with more advanced disease or that women who have suffered a recurrence define themselves more in terms of the breast cancer. Younger women also might be more likely to identify with cancer survivorship because the experience of cancer is more stressful for younger women (8). Among cancer survivors, younger age has been related to worse mental health (7), but better physical health (7) and greater stress-related growth (43). Finally, we examined whether survivor centrality is related to well-being measures, specifically positive and negative affect, quality of life, intrusive and avoidant thoughts, and benefit-finding. We hypothesize that the extent to which women view breast cancer in positive or negative terms will moderate these associations. That is, survivor centrality will only be related to poor outcomes if the illness is perceived in negative terms.

        High-dose chemotherapy and autologous PBSCT is a potentially highly effective treatment of women with metastatic and poor prognosis primary breast cancer. Randomised studies are required to compare this form of therapy to more standard forms of treatment in breast cancer.
