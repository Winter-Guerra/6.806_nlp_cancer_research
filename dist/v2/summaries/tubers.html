        Associations of dietary patterns with breast cancer risk varied by menopausal and body mass index status, but there was little difference in associations between non-Hispanic white and Hispanic women.

        DT-13 has an anti-thrombotic activity due to down-regulation of the increased mRNA expression levels of IL-6 and TF.

        These compounds are isolated from this plant for the first time. All compounds were evaluated against human colon cancer (HCT-8), human hepatoma (Bel7402), human stomach cancer(BGC-823), human lung adenocarcinoma (A549), human breast cancer (MCF-7), and human ovarian cancer (A2780) cell lines, and cirrhopetalanthrin (I) showed non-selective moderate cytotoxicity with IC50 values of 8.4-13.3 micromol x L(-1), and other compounds were inactive.

        The cytotoxic effect of studied proteins toward HeLa cell line cells has been evident and dependent on increasing dose of the protein. The present study, most probably, represents the first investigations on the effect of purified PR proteins from tuber extracts of a pharmacologically active plant on cell lines.

        The results from this study show that dietary soluble fiber intake is associated with a significantly reduced risk of ER− breast cancer among pre-menopausal women. Additional studies with larger sample size are needed to confirm these results.

        A diet characterized by a low P/S ratio seems to be more important for the development of breast cancer than total fat intake.
