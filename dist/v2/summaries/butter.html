        The results of the study suggest a negative association between consumption of fat used for seasoning (except butter) and breast cancer risk. This may be a direct effect or due to increased consumption of salad-type vegetables by high consumers of these sources of fats. The topic should be addressed in other studies in different populations.

        Analysis of food avoidance by women with breast cancer who participate in diet-intervention studies and by women without breast cancer may provide information about adherence to dietary guidelines and adequate nutrient consumption among these populations.

        A possible association of elements of adolescent diet with risk of breast cancer is reported, but the findings require confirmation in prospective study.

        In general, the dietary patterns showed consistent results across the three cohorts except for the possible protective effect of PPP in the NLCS cohort, which could be explained by a difference in that pattern for NLCS. The results supported the suggestion derived from traditional epidemiology that relatively recent diet may not have an important role in the etiology of breast cancer.

        Intake of high-fat dairy, but not low-fat dairy, was related to a higher risk of mortality after breast cancer diagnosis. Many studies (1–14) have evaluated whether dairy intake is related to breast cancer; results are equivocal (15). A recent meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies found a modest inverse association of dairy intake and breast cancer risk, but study heterogeneity was high (16). Individual studies have shown positive (12), inverse (4,6,7,10,11), and null (1,2,9,14,17) associations. One study found that associations varied by levels of fat; greater consumption of high-fat dairy intake was positively related whereas consumption of low-fat dairy intake was inversely related to breast cancer risk (8). Researchers have hypothesized a variety of mechanisms through which dairy might influence breast cancer risk, including calcium, vitamin D, insulin-like growth factors (18,19), conjugated linoleic acid (20), and estrogenic hormones (21). Equivocal findings could be related to the counteracting effects of a multiplicity of factors that may act on breast cancer. However, because estrogens are considered the major etiologic pathway to breast cancer, the influence of dairy intake on estrogens should be strongly considered in understanding how dairy affects breast cancer–specific outcomes. The Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study, which included women from Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Italy, and Greece, found that dairy intake was statistically significantly related to higher levels of estradiol and free estradiol (21). Ganmaa and Sato hypothesized that estrogen and progesterone levels are markedly elevated in dairy products consumed in the Western world compared with those produced in traditional herding societies because most of the milk in the West is produced by pregnant cows, with production enabled both by genetic modification of dairy cows as well as modifications to their feed (22,23). However, because estrogenic hormones reside primarily in fat, levels of female hormones may be substantially lower in skim vs whole milk (24). Insight as to the influence of dairy on breast cancer outcomes may be gained by separately evaluating associations of high- vs low-fat dairy intake and hormonal cancers. Equivocal findings in previous studies could be related to differing patterns of high- and low-fat dairy consumption in different populations and the failure to distinguish high- vs low-fat consumption. Consistent with this hypothesis, a recent study of dairy intake and prostate cancer survival found that greater consumption of whole milk was associated with worse survival but skim milk was associated with improved survival (25). No previous studies have evaluated associations of postdiagnosis high- vs low-fat dairy intake and breast cancer survival. We hypothesized that consumption of high-fat, but not low-fat, dairy foods would be related to a higher risk of recurrence and breast cancer mortality. We examined these associations in 1893 women with invasive breast cancer from the Life After Cancer Epidemiology (LACE) Study.

        Adherence to healthy dietary patterns (including whole grains, fruits, and vegetables, olive oil, and fish) seems to be favorable in not having breast cancer, among middle-aged women.

        A diet characterized by a low P/S ratio seems to be more important for the development of breast cancer than total fat intake.

        Among women whose tumor tissue is positive for the IGF-1 receptor, reducing carbohydrate intake after diagnosis could reduce the risk of breast cancer recurrence. These findings need replication in a larger sample.

        Although RRR may be useful in studies of diet and disease, our results suggest that RRR dietary patterns based on GI and GL provide similar information regarding the association between breast cancer, GI, and GL.
