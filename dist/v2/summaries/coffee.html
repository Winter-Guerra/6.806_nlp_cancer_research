        Findings from this meta-analysis suggested that coffee/caffeine might be weakly associated with breast cancer risk for postmenopausal women, and the association for BRCA1 mutation carriers deserves further investigation. Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

        Higher caffeinated coffee intake may be associated with lower risk of postmenopausal breast cancer. Decaffeinated coffee intake does not seem to be associated with breast cancer.

        Findings from this prospective study do not support a role of coffee consumption in the development of breast cancer but suggest that black tea consumption may be positively associated with risk of ER+/PR+ tumors.

        Moderate to high coffee consumption was associated with significantly decreased risk for early events in tamoxifen-treated patients and modified hormone receptor status. If confirmed, new recommendations regarding coffee consumption during tamoxifen treatment may be warranted.

        Fatigued breast cancer survivors have an abnormal proinflammatory cytokine activity, an average of 5 years after diagnosis, as well as significant serum cortisol derangements compared to other survivors. One possible interpretation of our results suggests that there is an abnormal hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis functioning in breast cancer patients with persistent fatigue, who might be using coffee to self-medicate. In other words, coffee consumption in the present study might be a surrogate marker for fatigue. Because of the paucity of data regarding caffeine intake, poor sleep, fatigue, and breast cancer survival, further studies could be worthwhile.

        Our findings suggest that coffee, black tea, and caffeine consumption before breast cancer diagnosis do not influence breast cancer-specific and overall survival. Coffee and black tea contain a mixture of compounds that have the potential to influence breast cancer risk and survival. Coffee may influence risk and progression through the inhibition of DNA methylation (Lee and Zhu, 2006), influences on tumour differentiation (Pozner et al, 1986), or alterations in sex hormone levels (Ferrini and Barrett-Connor, 1996; Nagata et al, 1998). Black tea has also been shown to alter sex hormone levels (Kuruto-Niwa et al, 2000; Wu et al, 2005), and the flavonoids it contains may have antioxidant effects (Trevisanato and Kim, 2000). Caffeine is found in both coffee and black tea, and in rodents has been shown to increase mammary cell differentiation (VanderPloeg et al, 1992) and decrease tumour incidence (Petrek et al, 1985). Conversely, caffeine has also been associated with increased mammary tumours in animal models (Welsch et al, 1983). Coffee consumption and breast cancer risk have been extensively studied with conflicting results (Ishitani et al, 2008; Bissonauth et al, 2009; Larsson et al, 2009a; Tang et al, 2009; Bhoo Pathy et al, 2010; Boggs et al, 2010; Nilsson et al, 2010; Fagherazzi et al, 2011; Gierach et al, 2011; Li et al, 2011). However, to our knowledge, only one observational study has examined coffee consumption and survival following breast cancer diagnosis (Sugiyama et al, 2010), and no studies have examined black tea or caffeine. In this study, we investigated whether pre-diagnosis coffee, black tea, and caffeine intake were associated with breast cancer survival among women diagnosed with invasive breast cancer in the population-based Swedish Mammography Cohort (SMC). We also examined whether the association between coffee, black tea, or caffeine and survival differed by hormone receptor status, disease stage at diagnosis, or smoking status.

        Our findings suggest that increased coffee intake is not associated with a significantly reduced risk of breast cancer, but we observe an inverse association in ER-negative subgroup analysis. More large studies are needed to determine subgroups to obtain more valuable data on coffee drinking and breast cancer risk.

        Data show no overall association between caffeine consumption and breast cancer risk. The possibility of an increased risk among women with benign breast disease or for tumors that are ER−PR− or greater than 2 cm in size warrants further study. Caffeine (1,3,7-trimethylxanthine), a natural purine alkaloid, is probably the most frequently consumed drug in the world.1, 2 Common beverages (coffee, tea, and soft drinks), cocoa or chocolate-containing food products, and certain medications, including headache or pain remedies, and over-the-counter stimulants, are important sources of caffeine.1, 3 In North America, coffee (60–75%) and tea (15–30%) are the primary sources of caffeine in the adult diet.1 Caffeine was hypothesized to increase risk of breast cancer after a report that women with benign breast disease experienced relief from symptoms after elimination of caffeine from their diet,2, 4 because benign breast disease, particularly atypical hyperplasia, is a marker of increased breast cancer risk.5 However, clinical studies have yielded inconsistent results for the effect on symptoms of benign breast disease when caffeine is eliminated or reduced or for the effect of caffeine on the development of benign breast disease.2, 6 Most case-control investigations reported no association between caffeine and/or caffeinated beverages and foods and breast cancer risk,7–17 but several case-control studies found either an inverse association18–20 or a weak positive association.19, 21–23 In three case-control studies that have evaluated the association according to menopausal status, two studies observed either a positive association or an inverse association only among premenopausal women,23, 24 and another study found an inverse association for coffee only among postmenopausal women and no association for tea regardless of menopausal status.25 Data from prospective studies, which are less prone to methodological bias, are limited and in general do not support an overall association,26–33 except that two studies showed a nonsignificant positive association for black tea34, 35 and one study found a significant inverse association only in postmenopausal women.33 In a few studies that have examined the association according to history of benign breast disease, no significant association was observed among women with benign breast disease.15, 18, 27 A Norwegian cohort reported that coffee reduced risk in lean women, whereas it increased risk in relatively overweight women.31 However, in three other large cohorts,27, 30, 33 and a large population-based case-control study,15 no association was observed in any stratum of body mass index. Breast cancer consists of diverse subtypes with different risk factors and clinical responsiveness to treatments.36 However, only a few studies have evaluated the association according to hormone receptor status of breast tumors.27, 33 To our knowledge, no previous studies have evaluated the association by tumor size, lymph node metastasis, and tumor differentiation, which reflect the stage of the carcinogenic process. With large numbers of cases and detailed information on tumor characteristics, we conducted a comprehensive analysis in the Women’s Health Study, a large prospective cohort.
