        Although the OmniHeart protein and unsaturated fat diets were superior to the carbohydrate diet in improving CVD risk, all 3 study diets were consistent with national guidelines to reduce chronic disease risk, which suggests that the guidelines might now be fine-tuned to optimize disease prevention. Popular diets vary in their nutritional adequacy and consistency with guidelines for risk reduction.

        Clinicians should be aware of patient-generated causal models of asthma and use of CAM in this population. Discussing patients&#x27; desire for an integrated approach to asthma management and involving social networks are 2 strategies that may enhance patient-provider partnerships and treatment fidelity. Asthma, one of the most common of all chronic illnesses, affects about 5% to 8% of the adult U.S. population1 and typifies the growing health disparities gap between ethnic/racial minorities and Caucasians.2 Asthma prevalence, for example, is significantly higher and asthma mortality rates are nearly 3-fold greater in African Americans (AA) compared with Caucasians.1 Individuals living in poverty experience even more profound health inequalities2 and poor AA women have the highest death rate from asthma in Philadelphia.3 Although most people living in poverty have access to a source of asthma care, poor racial/ethnic minorities are less likely to receive high quality, continuity of care, or education essential for asthma control,4,5 and are less often prescribed inhaled corticosteroids (ICS).6,7 Inhaled corticosteroid are the cornerstone of therapy and remain the most effective anti-inflammatory agents available for the treatment of persistent asthma.8 The use of ICS reduces asthma morbidity and mortality9,10 but their acceptance remains poor in all groups, including AAs.11,12 The Institute of Medicine&#x27;s report Unequal Treatment suggests that racial/ethnic minorities may prefer less intensive treatments.2 These preferences may have been shaped by experiences with institutionalized racism, may represent limited expendable incomes or may reflect greater use of culture-bound traditions, such as complementary and alternative medicine (CAM).2,13 The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) defines CAM as practices and products not presently considered part of conventional medicine.14 As a result of this broad definition, CAM can be considered to encompass a large and extremely diverse group of practices including: alternative medical systems (e.g., homeopathy, Traditional Chinese Medicine), mind-body interventions (e.g., prayer, yoga), biologically based treatments (e.g., botanicals), manipulative and body-based therapies (e.g., massage), and energy therapies (e.g., magnets).14 The prevalence of CAM is high;15 4 billion people use alternative medicine and as much of 80% of the world&#x27;s health care are based on these practices.16 Complementary and alternative medicine is commonly used for asthma.15 There are many reasons why patients may choose CAM in addition to, or as a substitute for, conventional care. Commonly, CAM is characterized as a more natural therapeutic approach to manufactured agents17 and some believe that CAM can reduce the need for conventional pharmacologic treatment, such as steroids.18 Complementary and alternative medicine is also seen as providing protection from illness19 or relief of symptoms20 while offering others hope for a cure.21 There is risk associated with CAM use, however. Although patients prefer to integrate CAM into their conventional treatments, providers are infrequently informed of CAM use.22 In addition, patients may hold alternative causal models of illness.23 According to Kleinman and Pachter,23,24 an individual&#x27;s understanding of his or her illness is derived from their unique interpretation of ill-health&#x27;s cause, symptom onset, physiologic response, natural history and individual preferences for providers and treatments. If patients have alternative models for disease causality, or when integrated CAM therapies are preferred but covertly used, then the patient may be at increased risk for poor clinical outcomes due to untoward drug-CAM interactions, unnecessary delays in seeking appropriate medical treatment and insufficient adherence to the medical plan with resulting and unwarranted intensification of conventional therapies. Under these circumstances, CAM use could contribute, in part, to observed health disparities. To address this question, large comparative studies will be needed. However, when little is known about how patients perceive illness and what treatment is preferred, qualitative research is a necessary first step. Qualitative research, a rigorous inductive data collection method, is the appropriate tool to uncover the unrevealed beliefs about a disease and its preferred treatment modalities.
