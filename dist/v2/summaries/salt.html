        Our study supported the assumption that occupational exposure may contribute to the etiology of breast cancer.

        ER expression may not increase correspondingly with increasing degree of obesity. Highly obese patients are more likely to have tumor subtypes associated with high proliferation and poorer prognosis.

        The data reported here implicate mitochondrial and ER stress as a component of C-6’s biological activity and provide insight into non-apoptotic cell death mechanisms; targeting biological pathways that induce mitochondrial dysfunction and ER stress may offer new strategies for the development of therapeutics that are effective against chemoresistant breast cancers.

        Breast cancer prevention might be possible by following the “World Cancer Research Fund” and the “American Institute of Cancer Research” recommendations, even in settings like Spain, where a high percentage of women already comply with many of them.

        In this large early-stage breast cancer cohort, MN risk after radiation and/or adjuvant chemotherapy was low but higher than previously described. Risk continued to increase beyond 5 years. Individual risk of MN must be balanced against the absolute survival benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy. © 2014 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.

        The HRD scores showed strong correlation with BRCA1/2 deficiency regardless of breast cancer subtype. The frequency of elevated scores suggests that a significant proportion of all breast tumor subtypes may carry defects in the homologous recombination DNA repair pathway. The HRD scores can be combined to produce a more robust predictor of HRD. The combination of a robust score, and the FFPE compatible assay described in this study, may facilitate use of agents targeting homologous recombination DNA repair in the clinical setting.

        Significant discordance remains between clinical assay-defined subsets and intrinsic subtype. For identifying basal-like breast cancer, the optimal HR IHC cut point was &lt;1%, matching the American Society of Clinical Oncology and College of American Pathologists guidelines. Tumors with borderline HR staining are molecularly diverse and may require additional assays to clarify underlying biology. ©AlphaMed Press.

        These results suggest that some risk factors not commonly studied may be important for breast cancer and some frequently cited risk factors may be relatively unimportant or secondary.

        Taste alteration affects breast cancer patients&#x27; lives, and they develop management strategies to deal with the effect. While some self-management strategies can be seen as positively adaptive, the potential for increased caloric consumption and poor eating behaviors associated with some coping strategies may be a cause for concern given the observation of weight gain during breast cancer treatment and association of obesity with poor treatment outcomes in breast cancer patients. Further studies are warranted to determine the overall burden of this symptom and measurement of cancer and non-cancer-related consequences of these behavioral adaptations.

        VA patients with breast cancer have higher incidences of most comorbidities than patients in the PS. Differences in complication rates females disappear when adjustment is made for the higher rates of comorbidities in the VA patients.
