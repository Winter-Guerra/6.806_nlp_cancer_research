        Age (&gt; 45 years), low family income (&lt; $520/month), poor educational level (primary school level or lower) and past regular consumption of pork fat and fatty meat may be factors associated with an increased risk of breast cancer.

        We observed no association between total fruit and vegetable intake and risk of overall
breast cancer. However, vegetable consumption was inversely associated with risk of
ER− breast cancer in our large pooled analyses. Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease. Expression of the estrogen receptor (ER) can be
used to explain, in part, some of the differences in etiology, and clinical characteristics of
breast cancer and survival rates among breast cancer patients (1–3). Breast tumors that express the ER (ER+
tumors) are more strongly associated with hormone-related factors than tumors that do not
express the ER (ER− tumors). Classic risk factors, such as late age at first
birth and number of births, are more consistently associated with risk of
ER+ breast cancer than with risk of ER− breast cancer
(1). In addition, few risk factors have been
identified for ER− breast cancer. Fruit and vegetable intake has been hypothesized to reduce the risk of
breast cancer, but the current evidence is inconclusive. A recent meta-analysis of 14 cohort
studies reported a statistically significant 11% reduced risk of breast cancer overall
comparing high vs low fruit and vegetable intake; results were not reported for breast cancer
subtypes defined by receptor status (4). Three
cohort studies (5–7) have recently
investigated the association between fruit and vegetable intake and risk of breast cancer by
receptor status. All three studies found that women who consumed higher levels of fruits and
vegetables had a 32% to 50% lower risk of ER− breast cancer compared with
women who consumed low levels of fruits and vegetables. In another cohort study that evaluated
only dietary patterns, women consuming a high fruit or salad pattern were observed to have a
45% lower risk of ER− breast cancer (8). Because the number of studies examining ER− breast cancer is
limited, more evidence is needed to examine the role of diet in ER− breast
cancer. One challenge in examining ER− breast cancer in
epidemiologic studies is that ER− breast cancer accounts for only 15% to 20%
of breast cancers (9). Thus, in most studies, the
number of ER− breast cancer case patients is relatively low, which affects
the power to detect modest associations with certainty. Therefore, with the advantage of a large number of case patients, we
evaluated the relation between fruit and vegetable consumption and risk of breast cancer by ER
status in a pooled analysis of 20 prospective cohorts. These analyses expand our prior
analyses of fruit and vegetable consumption and breast cancer risk (10) by including 12 more prospective studies and increasing the
follow-up time for most of the studies in the original analyses. In addition, only two of the
20 studies in this pooled analysis have previously examined associations specifically with
fruit and vegetable consumption and risk of ER− breast cancer (5, 6). In
secondary analyses, we examined tumors classified by progesterone receptor (PR) status.

        The results from this study show that dietary soluble fiber intake is associated with a significantly reduced risk of ER− breast cancer among pre-menopausal women. Additional studies with larger sample size are needed to confirm these results.
