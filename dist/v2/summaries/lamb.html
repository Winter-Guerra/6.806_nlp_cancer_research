        Exemestane is effective in postmenopausal patients with tamoxifen-refractory advanced breast cancer, prolonging time to disease progression and treatment failure and improving survival compared with megestrol treatment. Moreover, exemestane has an acceptable tolerability profile and a convenient once daily oral dosage regimen. Available data indicate that exemestane maintains its efficacy in patients with visceral metastases and does not show cross-resistance with nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors. Preliminary data indicate that exemestane is also effective as first-line therapy for advanced breast cancer.

        Letrozole, in common with vorozole and anastrozole, offers greater selectivity and potency of aromatase inhibition than the prototype aromatase inhibitor, aminoglutethimide, and can be administered once daily. Available clinical data suggest that letrozole achieves a significantly longer duration of response than megestrol and aminoglutethimide and longer overall survival than aminoglutethimide. However, direct comparisons are required to distinguish between the newer aromatase inhibitors. For this reason, letrozole should be recommended as a second-line treatment in postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer whose disease has progressed on or failed to respond to antiestrogen therapy.

        To our knowledge, this is the first effort to systematically identify and validate drivers for expression based CNV regions in breast cancer. The framework where the wavelet analysis of copy number alteration based on expression coupled with the gene regulatory network analysis, provides a blueprint for leveraging genomic data to identify key regulatory components and gene targets. This integrative approach can be applied to many other large-scale gene expression studies and other novel types of cancer data such as next-generation sequencing based expression (RNA-Seq) as well as CNV data.

        Collectively, these data highlight differential Wnt signalling in breast cancer subtypes and activity in patient-derived metastatic cancer stem-like cells indicating a potential for Wnt-targeted treatment in breast cancers.

        We demonstrate, for the first time, inhibition of tumor growth in vivo using asPR. Our results provide further evidence for a critical and hierarchical role of the PR pathway in mammary carcinomas.

        Cost-utility analyses, compiled in the absence of direct comparative data, show that docetaxel offers utility gains versus paclitaxel in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. The incremental cost for these gains is within the accepted range for healthcare interventions.
