        Dairy consumption is not strongly related to breast cancer risk in this prospective study. A non-significant negative association between calcium intake and breast cancer risk was seen, particularly among premenopausal women.

        Our study provides additional support for the hypothesis that a dietary pattern rich in fruit and salad might protect against invasive breast cancer and that the effect might be stronger for ER- and PR-negative tumours. Most of the studies on the risk of breast cancer in relation to individual foods and nutrients have had inconsistent results (Michels et al, 2007). Dietary pattern analysis is an increasingly common alternative approach for examining the relationship between diet and the risk of disease or biomarkers of disease (Newby and Tucker, 2004). Factor analysis applied to dietary data produces a few patterns of dietary intake that represent underlying independent dimensions of food and nutrient consumption. The assessment of dietary patterns in this way overcomes limitations of the single food or nutrient approach (Newby and Tucker, 2004). Two recent systematic literature reviews (Edefonti et al, 2009; Brennan et al, 2010) found consistent evidence that a ‘prudent&#x27;/‘healthy&#x27; dietary pattern was associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer. Breast cancer, similar to most cancers, is heterogeneous in its pathology, natural history and response to treatment. Breast cancer differ, for example, with respect to oestrogen (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) status; hormone receptor-positive cancers exhibiting better differentiated morphological appearance and stronger clinical response to hormonal treatment (Althuis et al, 2004). There is evidence to suggest that risk factors (Colditz et al, 2004), including food items (Olsen et al, 2003; Stripp et al, 2003; Suzuki et al, 2005; Zhang et al, 2005; Cho et al, 2006) and dietary patterns (Fung et al, 2005; Velie et al, 2005; Agurs-Collins et al, 2009) differ in their association by tumour receptor status. Using data from the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study (MCCS), we analyze the effect of dietary patterns on breast cancer risk overall, by attained age during follow-up and by tumour characteristics, including tumour grade and ER and PR status.

        Intake of high-fat dairy, but not low-fat dairy, was related to a higher risk of mortality after breast cancer diagnosis. Many studies (1–14) have evaluated whether dairy intake is related to breast cancer; results are equivocal (15). A recent meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies found a modest inverse association of dairy intake and breast cancer risk, but study heterogeneity was high (16). Individual studies have shown positive (12), inverse (4,6,7,10,11), and null (1,2,9,14,17) associations. One study found that associations varied by levels of fat; greater consumption of high-fat dairy intake was positively related whereas consumption of low-fat dairy intake was inversely related to breast cancer risk (8). Researchers have hypothesized a variety of mechanisms through which dairy might influence breast cancer risk, including calcium, vitamin D, insulin-like growth factors (18,19), conjugated linoleic acid (20), and estrogenic hormones (21). Equivocal findings could be related to the counteracting effects of a multiplicity of factors that may act on breast cancer. However, because estrogens are considered the major etiologic pathway to breast cancer, the influence of dairy intake on estrogens should be strongly considered in understanding how dairy affects breast cancer–specific outcomes. The Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study, which included women from Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Italy, and Greece, found that dairy intake was statistically significantly related to higher levels of estradiol and free estradiol (21). Ganmaa and Sato hypothesized that estrogen and progesterone levels are markedly elevated in dairy products consumed in the Western world compared with those produced in traditional herding societies because most of the milk in the West is produced by pregnant cows, with production enabled both by genetic modification of dairy cows as well as modifications to their feed (22,23). However, because estrogenic hormones reside primarily in fat, levels of female hormones may be substantially lower in skim vs whole milk (24). Insight as to the influence of dairy on breast cancer outcomes may be gained by separately evaluating associations of high- vs low-fat dairy intake and hormonal cancers. Equivocal findings in previous studies could be related to differing patterns of high- and low-fat dairy consumption in different populations and the failure to distinguish high- vs low-fat consumption. Consistent with this hypothesis, a recent study of dairy intake and prostate cancer survival found that greater consumption of whole milk was associated with worse survival but skim milk was associated with improved survival (25). No previous studies have evaluated associations of postdiagnosis high- vs low-fat dairy intake and breast cancer survival. We hypothesized that consumption of high-fat, but not low-fat, dairy foods would be related to a higher risk of recurrence and breast cancer mortality. We examined these associations in 1893 women with invasive breast cancer from the Life After Cancer Epidemiology (LACE) Study.

        Beliefs about weight and breast cancer risk were informed by social networks, media reports and personal experiences of significant others diagnosed with breast cancer. Our study has highlighted common doubts, anxieties and questions and the importance of providing a credible rationale for weight control and weight loss which addresses individual concerns. Counselling and health education material should be tailored to facilitate understanding of both genetic and modifiable risk factors and should do more help individuals to visualise the weight and breast cancer link.

        The present study findings revealed a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and osteoporosis in breast cancer patients. Also, the dietary intake of vitamin D and calcium was significantly lower in breast cancer women. © 2012 The Authors International Journal of Rheumatic Diseases © 2012 Asia Pacific League of Associations for Rheumatology and Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.

        We describe a case with yellowish papules on both breasts in a woman that underwent breast augmentation by injection of liquid silicone. Since this unusual presentation of oleomas can be confused with cutaneous xanthomas, a biopsy is essential for diagnosis.
