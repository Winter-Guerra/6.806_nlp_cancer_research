        There is a lack of EB and MPI in the development of current breast apps. Safety concerns highlight the need for regulation, full authorship disclosure and clinical trials. A robust framework for identifying high quality applications is necessary. This will address the current barrier pertaining to a lack of consumer confidence in their use and further aid to promote their widespread implementation within healthcare.

        There are hundreds of cancer-focused apps with the potential to enhance efforts to promote behavior change, to monitor a host of symptoms and physiological indicators of disease, and to provide real-time supportive interventions, conveniently and at low cost. However, there is a lack of evidence on their utility, effectiveness, and safety. Future efforts should focus on improving and consolidating the evidence base into a whitelist for public consumption.

        Efforts to improve cancer care quality by improved treatment reporting must overcome key barriers, especially those involving information exchange and mistrust. Communications between the TR and oncology practices must improve to facilitate better treatment measurement and reporting. In 2007, the American College of Surgeons’ Commission on Cancer, in conjunction with the National Quality Forum, took the bold step of adding measures of adjuvant breast and colon cancer treatments to their accreditation process. The step was bold as it made hospital tumor registrars accountable for reporting care often delivered beyond hospital walls and jurisdictions, and created a particular challenge for hospitals that had significant proportions of community-based physicians providing adjuvant treatments. Although reporting rates of treatment is not yet required, these adjuvant treatment measures will likely serve as a basis for the quality of care ratings, and possibly for reimbursement as pay-for-performance incentive systems extend to include new metrics.1,2 Moreover, given that measurement and reporting are the cornerstones of quality improvement efforts,3 it is imperative that these treatment measurement and reporting processes be both timely and accurate. Adjuvant cancer treatments are often given by different out-of-hospital physicians and few practices, whether hospital based or community based, are able to automatically identify and report treatments. As a result, problems with the accuracy and underreporting of treatments provided in the outpatient setting have been acknowledged and studied.4–6 In practice, the accuracy of treatment reporting has been found to vary with the level of decentralization of care delivery. A study demonstrated better reporting of radiation therapy that was delivered through limited numbers of licensed facilities (as per statistical data from the National Cancer Institute’s Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results program, 80% to 95%) compared with chemotherapy reporting that was more often delivered in oncologists’ individual offices (Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results reports 60% complete chemotherapy data)7; the least accurate reporting was for hormonal therapies that can be written by any physician (36% accuracy).4 Measuring and reporting accurate adjuvant treatment data pose significant challenges to hospital tumor registries as they must obtain data from numerous sites both within the hospital (intraorganizational practice sites) and outside the hospital (interorganizational practice sites with varying affiliations and structures). Hospitals may have varying levels of jurisdiction over independent office practices, thus creating difficulties when trying to ensure comprehensive data reporting from these physicians’ practices. Furthermore, the ability to report adjuvant treatments requires the ability to find that information. Despite the explosive growth in electronic medical record (EMR) systems, only about one quarter of U.S. physician practices use EMRs,8 and only 20% report receiving feedback about clinical performance from their EMR systems.9 In addition, physicians are often concerned about releasing data in the age of the Health Information Portability and Accountability Act.10 These significant challenges thus hinder hospitals’ abilities to obtain, compile, and report adjuvant treatment data. We initiated this study to assess the scope of the problem of physicians’ reporting of adjuvant treatments to a hospital tumor registry (TR), and to improve our understanding of treatment measurement and reporting barriers to inform future efforts aimed to improve breast cancer treatment measurement and reporting.

        C3G blocks ethanol-induced activation of the ErbB2/cSrc/FAK pathway which is necessary for cell migration/invasion. C3G may be beneficial in preventing/reducing ethanol-induced breast cancer metastasis.
