        Findings from this meta-analysis suggest that cruciferous vegetables consumption may reduce the risk of breast cancer. Because of the limited number of studies, further prospective studies are needed to explore the protective effect of cruciferous vegetables on breast cancer. Copyright Â© 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

        Cruciferous vegetable intake might be inversely associated with pancreatic cancer risk. Because of the limited number of studies included in this meta-analysis, further well-designed prospective studies are warranted to confirm the inverse association between cruciferous vegetable intake and risk of pancreatic cancer.

        Our results suggest an overall null association between total fruit and vegetable intake and breast cancer risk. Intake of cruciferous vegetable showed a statistically significant association with a decreased risk of breast cancer among premenopausal women.

        Epidemiologic evidence suggests that cruciferous vegetable intake may be weakly and inversely associated with lung cancer risk. Due to a gene-diet interaction, the strongest inverse association was among those with homozygous deletion for GSTM1 and GSTT1.

        Our study suggests that CV consumption may reduce the risk of lung cancer in women, particularly among never smokers.

        Isothiocyanates enhance response to 4-hydroxytamoxifen, which allows for reduction of the effective drug concentration. Combinatorial strategy may hold promise in development of therapies and chemoprevention strategies against ER-positive breast tumors, even those with acquired resistance to the drug.

        Our results suggest that high intake of total vegetables, certain fruits, milk, and eggs may reduce the risk of breast cancer, while high consumption of animal-source foods may increase risk. The dietary associations did not appear to vary by ER/PR status.

        Our results provide the first evidence that a natural anti-cancer compound mediates its cellular and in vivo tumor anti-proliferative responses by selectively stimulating cellular interactions of the stem/progenitor cell marker nucleostemin with MDM2, which frees p53 to trigger its apoptotic response. Furthermore, our study provides a new mechanistic template that can potentially be exploited for the development of therapeutic strategies targeted at cancer stem/progenitor cells.
