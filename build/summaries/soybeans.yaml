['Soybean intake is increasing in the U.S. diet, but primarily through the consumption
    of soy protein isolate and soy lecithin in processed foods, soybean oil, and soy-based
    animal and fish feed.', This web page is intended to examine the impact of consuming
    less highly processed soy foods on breast cancer risk., 'Such foods include tofu,
    edamame and tempeh.', Most of the population studies concerning the consumption
    of soy foods have been performed in Asian populations., This raises some question
    as to how applicable the results might be to non-Asian populations since Asians
    are more likely to convert soy phytoestrogens to potentially protective metabolites
    in the gut than Caucasians (see the genistein and daidzein webpage)., 'As shown
    in the brief summaries below, studies of the impact of consuming non-highly processed
    soy foods on breast cancer risk are somewhat contradictory, but generally have
    found a protective effect against breast cancer.', Several studies have also found
    that high soy food intake during childhood or adolescence may reduce the risk
    of breast cancer in later life., 'A case-control study designed to examine the
    association between childhood soy intake and breast cancer risk in U.S. women
    of Asian (Chinese, Japanese, and Filipino) descent found inverse associations
    with childhood soy intake in all three groups and women born both in Asia and
    the U.S.', The authors concluded that early-life exposure to soy may influence
    breast cancer incidence., 'A study designed to compare insulin-like growth factor-I
    (IGF-I) levels in Japanese women in Japan and Japanese and Caucasians in Hawaii
    with high and low soy intake found that average IGF-I levels were 11% lower among
    women in the highest tofu consumption category compared with the lowest, but the
    difference in IGF-I levels between tofu consumption levels was only significant
    among women in Japan.', IGF-I is thought to be a link between diet and breast
    cancer risk since high circulating levels of IGF-I appears to increase cell proliferation
    and reduce apoptosis., 'The average IGF-I levels were 213 for Japanese in Japan,
    257 for Japanese in Hawaii, and 255 ng/ml for Caucasians in Hawaii.', Tofu intake
    was higher in Japan than among either Hawaiian groups., 'A case-control study
    designed to investigate the association between isoflavone intake and breast cancer
    risk among Japanese, Japanese Brazilians and non-Japanese Brazilians found an
    inverse association between isoflavone intake and breast cancer risk for Brazilians,
    whether Japanese or non-Japanese, but only a non-significant inverse association
    limited to postmenopausal women in Japan.', A German case-control study of premenopausal
    breast cancer found that the highest vs. lowest intake quartiles of dietary daidzein
    and genistein resulted in significantly reduced breast cancer risk., This protective
    effect was found to be associated with hormone receptor-positive tumors., 'High
    intake of other isoflavonoids such as formononetin and biochanin A, as well as
    total isoflavonoids, were not associated with a decrease in breast cancer risk.',
  No impact on risk was found for total phytoestrogen intake., The authors concluded
    that the dietary intake of daidzein and genistein may have an important role in
    reducing breast cancer risk despite relatively low levels of intake., 'A U.S.
    and Canadian case-control study designed to examine the associations between diet
    and premenopausal bilateral breast cancer found that total fat, monounsaturated
    fat, polyunsaturated fat, oleic acid, and linoleic acid intake each were found
    to be inversely associated with risk of premenopausal bilateral breast cancer.',
  'On the other hand, intake of carbohydrates and sweetened beverages were associated
    with increased risk.', Reductions in risk were also observed for intakes of low-fat
    dairy products and tofu., 'The authors concluded that monounsaturated and polyunsaturated
    fats, as well as soy foods, might reduce the risk of premenopausal bilateral breast
    cancer.', 'An Australian study that measured urinary isoflavones, as well as serum
    and urinary sex steroids in postmenopausal women with recently diagnosed breast
    cancer (before surgery) and disease-free controls found that the breast cancer
    cases had lower 24-hour urinary daidzein compared to controls and somewhat lower
    urinary genistein excretion.', Total testosterone was found to be higher in women
    with breast cancer compared with controls., The authors commented that the findings
    were in keeping with other observational data demonstrating a protective effect
    from phytoestrogens on breast cancer risk., 'A large Japanese prospective study
    found no significant associations between consumption of soy foods (tofu, boiled
    soybeans, miso soup) and the risk of breast cancer, including for postmenopausal
    women as a group.', The authors concluded that consumption of soy food has no
    protective effects against breast cancer., A Japanese case-control study found
    high intake of soybean products to be associated with lower risk of breast cancer
    in premenopausal women., The authors concluded that they had found a statistically
    significant inverse association between tofu or isoflavone intake and risk of
    breast cancer among premenopausal women but not among postmenopausal women., 'A
    Chinese study of 5,042 breast cancer survivors found that soy food intake was
    inversely associated with breast cancer-related death and recurrence.', Risks
    of recurrence and death both were found to be approximately 30% lower for women
    with the highest fourth of soy protein consumption compared to the lowest quartile.,
  The results held for both estrogen receptor positive (ER+) and estrogen receptor
    negative (ER-) breast cancer., A Chinese case-control study found that both premenopausal
    and postmenopausal women in the highest quartile of total isoflavone intake had
    reduced risks of all receptor status subtypes of breast cancer., 'A stronger protective
    effect of high isoflavone intake was found for breast cancer tumors with concordant
    rather than discordant receptor status; i.e., those with ER+/PR+ or ER-/PR- status.',
  A large prospective study of ethnically Chinese women in Singapore found that breast
    cancer risk was significantly reduced in association with high soy intake for
    postmenopausal women (but not for premenopausal women)., The protective effect
    was stronger in women with above median body mass index than in leaner women.,
  'A large Chinese prospective study designed to investigate the impact of soy intake
    on risk of breast cancer found an inverse dose-response relationship for the intake
    of all the individual soy food items evaluated in the study, including tofu, fresh
    soybeans, dried beans, soy products, soy bean sprouts, and soy milk.', The inverse
    association was stronger among pre-menopausal women., 'When adolescent soy consumption
    was considered, pre-menopausal women with the highest soy protein intake during
    both adolescence and adulthood had a more than 50% lower risk compared to women
    with the lowest soy intake in both periods.', 'A Korean case-control study comparing
    the diets of breast cancer patients with a healthy control group found that the
    breast cancer patients consumed significantly fewer eggs and a significantly lower
    quantity of bean curd (tofu), onion, garlic, green pepper, sweet pepper, kale,
    cucumber, seasoned bean sprouts, sesame leaf, zucchini, radish, mushroom, crown
    daisy, red pepper paste, bean paste, spicy bean paste, orange juice, grape juice,
    and tomato juice than the controls.', 'On the other hand, the breast cancer patients
    consumed significantly greater quantities of cooked rice, noodles, deep fried
    chicken, satsuma mandarin, Korean melon, kimchi and coffee than the controls.',
  'Another Korean case-control study designed to examine the relationship between
    fruit, vegetable, and soy intake and the risk of breast cancer found that, in
    premenopausal women, high tomato consumption was associated with lower breast
    cancer risk.', 'In postmenopausal women, high grape, green pepper, and soybean
    consumption were each found to be associated with lower breast cancer risk.',
  'On the other hand, a small Korean study reported that soybean and soy isoflavone
    consumption was found to be associated with increased risk of recurrence among
    women with HER2/neu overexpressing (HER2+) tumors, whereas it reduced risk of
    relapse in women with HER2- disease.', 'On the other hand, soybeans contain relatively
    high levels of copper, which could contribute to angiogenesis and metastasis of
    breast cancer.', 'Soybeans should be avoided during radiation treatment because
    genistein has been shown to protect cells against cell death caused by radiation
    damage, raising the possibility that consuming soybeans will lessen the cytotoxic
    impact of radiation on breast cancer cells.', 'Edamame are immature soybeans,
    typically prepared by boiling them whole in their green pods.', Tempeh is made
    by the controlled fermentation of cooked soybeans., 'Soybeans have relatively
    high levels of phytic acid, which binds to some ingested minerals such as calcium,
    magnesium, iron, and zinc in the intestinal tract, and thereby reduces the amounts
    available in the body.', This can be undesirable for people with a low intake
    of essential minerals (especially infants and young children)., _Below are links
