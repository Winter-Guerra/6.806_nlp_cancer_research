['Parsley has been shown to have potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities,
    as well as moderate antimicrobial, antifungal, antiviral, radioprotective, antispasmodic,
    anti-anxiety, and cholesterol-lowering properties.', 'Because parsley typically
    does not comprise a large portion of the diet of any group of people, there are
    no population-based studies that specifically isolate the association between
    consuming parsley and the risk of cancer.', 'Instead, the epidemiological information
    available comes from studies in which parsley was a vegetable component of the
    diet.', There are numerous studies concerning the anti-cancer components of parsley.,
  'Parsley contains 8-methoxypsoralen, which has been shown to inhibit the development
    of carcinogen-induced lung cancer in laboratory mice.', 'Parsley also is a dietary
    source of imperatorin and isopimpinellin, which have been shown to have chemopreventive
    effects in liver, lung and mammary epithelial cells.', 'Parsley leaf oil and parsley
    seed oil contain myristicin, which has been shown to inhibit the proliferation
    of carcinogen-induced lung cancer in mice.', 'Parsley contains the flavones apigenin,
    luteolin, chrysoeriol, the flavonols quercetin, myricetin and isorhamnetin, and
    the isoflavone genistein.', 'Parsley is a good dietary source of apigenin, which
    has been shown to induce apoptosis in human skin, thyroid, gastric, liver, colon,
    cervical, and prostate cancer cells, and to inhibit migration and invasion of
    ovarian cancer cells.', Apigenin has also been shown to exhibit potent growth-inhibitory
    effects in HER2/neu overexpressing breast cancer cells., The growth-inhibitory
    effects of apigenin are less powerful for those cells expressing normal levels
    of HER2/neu., 'Luteolin has been shown to induce apoptosis in oral cancer calls,
    to promote cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in colon cancer cells, and to inhibit
    insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) receptor signaling in prostate cancer cells.',
  Luteolin has also been shown increase the anti-cancer effects of the chemotherapy
    drug Taxol (paclitaxel)., Quercetin has been shown to inhibit proliferation of
    estrogen receptor negative (ER-) breast cancer cells., 'A major Italian population
    study including 2,569 women with breast cancer found that the risk of breast cancer
    was reduced for increasing intake of flavones and flavonols.', 'Italian, or flat
    leaf parsley is named for its leaves, which are flat compared to the curly leaves
    of common parsley.', 'Cilantro, also called Chinese parsley, consists of the stems
    and leaves of the coriander plant (coriandrum sativum), which is in the parsley
    family.', 'The antioxidant capacity of parsley is enhanced when it is used in
    soups or stews (i.e., when it is boiled) but is reduced when grilled or fried.',
  'Parsley seed oil is an ingredient in some breath freshening products, presumably
    for its antimicrobial and antiseptic properties.', Parsley seed oil contains oleic
    acid (the main fatty acid in olive oil)., 'However, the biologically active components
    of parsley seed oil are very concentrated and it should generally be avoided,
    especially by those who are pregnant (since it can cause miscarriage), have kidney,
    heart, or liver disorders, or are on high blood pressure medications, lithium,
    monoamine oxidase Inhibitors, or opiates.', _Below are links to recent studies
