['Cabbage contains numerous substances with suspected or demonstrated cancer fighting
    properties, including indole-3-carbinol (I3C), 3,3''-diindolylmethane (DIM), sulforaphane,
    lupeol, sinigrin and several other glucosinolates.', Cabbage is also a good dietary
    source of the lignan enterolactone., 'Boy choy, or Chinese cabbage, is a good
    source of apigenin.', 'Cabbage has been shown to suppress inflammation, act as
    an antioxidant and improve diabetes in experimental mice.', 'In addition, cabbage
    has been shown to inhibit urinary bladder and liver carcinogenesis, and reduce
    the risk of occurrence of prostate, lung, gallbladder, stomach, cervical, kidney
    and colorectal cancer.', 'This anticarcinogenic activity has been found in green
    cabbage, red cabbage, bok choy, and to some extent, in sauerkraut.', 'As a result
    of its pigmentation, red cabbage contains numerous anthocyanins, some of which
    have anticarcinogenic activity, however green cabbage may be more chemopreventive
    overall than red cabbage.', 'Cabbage has been found to be promote apoptosis, suppress
    cell cycle progression and inhibit angiogenesis of human breast cancer cells.',
  'Furthermore, cabbage can protect against cell DNA damage.', 'Consumption of cabbage
    has been shown to reduce the estrogen metabolite 16alpha-hydroxyestrone, which
    is a breast cancer promoter.', Cabbage components I3C and sulforaphane have both
    been shown increase the anti-cancer effects of the chemotherapy drug Taxol (paclitaxel).,
  One carefully designed study of Chinese women found that brassica vegetable consumption
    (with Chinese cabbage as a large component of the diet) was associated with significantly
    reduced breast cancer risk., Cabbage loses a significant proportion of its chemopreventive
    properties when cooked., 'Ideally, it should be consumed raw and chopped, steam
    cooked, cooked for a short period of time in a small amount of water, or consumed
    as sauerkraut (however, select low-sodium sauerkraut).', 'Kimchi, a traditional
    Korean food typically consisting primarily of fermented Chinese cabbage, should
    be consumed only in moderation by breast cancer patients, survivors and those
    at high risk for breast cancer.', 'Sauerkraut has a high salt content, which should
    be taken into account by people who need to restrict their sodium intake.', Cabbage
    can reduce the bioavailability of iodine in the diet., We recommend consuming
    cabbage and other cruciferous vegetables as food and against consuming "broccoli
    pills" that have been enhanced to boost the proportion of the presumed key anti-cancer
    chemicals in these vegetables., There is some evidence that concentrated cruciferous
    vegetable extracts can act as estrogen agonists and promote breast cancer cell
    proliferation., 'Also, the anticancer properties of cabbage are likely to be the
    result of synergistic interaction of its various chemical components - isolated
    components have successfully inhibited proliferation in the laboratory, but their
    efficacy and safety in humans needs to be evaluated in large scale clinical trials.',
  Cruciferous vegetables contain thioglucoside compounds that can interfere with the
    formation of thyroid hormone., _Below are links to recent studies concerning this
    food., 'For a list of studies that includes older research, please click on cabbage._']
