['By "almond," we mean the nut of the sweet almond tree (Prunus amygdalus dulcis),
    not the bitter almond nut (Prunus amygdalus amara).', 'Almonds are a good dietary
    source of vitamin E, magnesium, copper, chromium, manganese, phosphorus, riboflavin
    and melatonin, as well as soluble fiber and monounsaturated fats.', 'Almonds contain
    numerous phytochemicals, including quercetin, quercitrin, isorhamnetin, naringenin,
    catechin, epicatechin, and morin.', Almond components have been shown to have
    high antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties., 'Consumption of almonds has
    been shown in numerous studies to help lower cholesterol, reduce blood sugar,
    and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.', Habitual almond consumption does
    not in and of itself appear to lead to weight gain., Almond consumption has been
    associated with lower risk of colon cancer., 'Although almonds share some of the
    favorable characteristics of other tree nuts such as walnuts, there is little
    specific evidence concerning almond consumption and breast cancer risk.', Almonds
    are an excellent source of melatonin., 'Melatonin protects against breast cancer
    in several ways, including by reducing aromatase activity within the breast, thereby
    reducing estrogen production.', 'Ideally, almonds should be eaten unroasted and
    with their skins on.', Almond milk can be a good substitute for milk and almond
    butter is a very good substitute for peanut butter., 'Almond oil (i.e., sweet
    almond oil) has been found to have beneficial effects on cholesterol profile and
    it appears that the favorable effect of almonds is due to components in the oil
    portion of these nuts.', 'Pure almond extract normally is manufactured using a
    small amount of bitter almond oil but it is relatively safe in small quantities,
    especially when used in baking and other forms of cooking involving heat.', 'Marzipan
    can be a relatively healthy confection, as long as it is made with ground sweet
    almonds.', 'Marzipan made with a substantial portion of bitter almonds or peanuts,
    and persipan made with apricot or peach kernels should be avoided.', Almond oil
    can safely be used in the massage of seriously ill patients and patients undergoing
    chemotherapy., 'On the other hand, bitter almond oil, which can cause cyanide
    poisoning, should not be ingested or used on the skin.', 'Laetrile, a synthetic
    form of amygdalin (found in bitter almonds and apricot kernels), has long been
    used as an alternative cancer treatment, although it is less popular now than
    in the 1970s and early 1980s when numerous laetrile clinics in Tijuana, Mexico
    were established to meet the demand from U.S. cancer patients.', The claim that
    laetrile is an effective and benign cancer treatment is not supported by sound
    clinical data., 'Laetrile has been found ineffective in shrinking tumors, increasing
    survival time, and alleviating cancer symptoms.', 'Although sometimes referred
    to as vitamin B17, laetrile is not a vitamin.', 'Some cases of acute accidental
    cyanide poisoning have been reported with the use of laetrile in combination with
    vitamin C. Vitamin C is known to increase the conversion of amygdalin to cyanide
    and reduce body stores of cysteine, which is used to detoxify cyanide.', _Below
