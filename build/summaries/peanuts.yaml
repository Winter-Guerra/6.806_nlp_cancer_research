[Peanuts contain resveratrol and are an excellent source of monounsaturated fat.,
  'Consumption of peanuts is associated with lower levels of inflammatory markers,
    which may account for the inverse relationship between nut consumption and risk
    of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes.', Peanuts have also been shown
    to promote weight management when consumed as part of a moderate fat diet because
    of its satiating effect., Frequent peanut consumption is associated with a reduced
    risk of gallstone disease in men., Peanut extracts have been shown to suppress
    the proliferation of human prostate cancer cells., 'Peanuts contain peanut agglutinin
    (PNA), a protein that binds to a sugar expressed by most human cancers.', A 2014
    study demonstrated that PNA at blood concentrations found after peanut consumption
    promotes the progression of two important steps in metastasis., Peanut consumption
    was also found to increase metastasis in a mouse model of breast cancer., A 2015
    study reported that PNA had the potential to promote breast cancer metastasis
    through increased vascular invasion and lymph node involvement., Note that peanut
    oil also contains a trace amount of PNA., 'Peanuts typically are infected to some
    extent with molds which produce aflatoxins, which are mutagenic, carcinogenic
    and teratogenic and cause immuno-suppression in humans.', 'Aflatoxin B1 has been
    shown to cause liver cancer, especially in hepatitis B-positive individuals.',
  Peanuts have been shown in several studies to stimulate proliferation of colon cancer
    cells., However one large Taiwanese study found that peanut consumption was associated
    with lower colorectal cancer risk., Breathing the fumes of peanut oil used in
    frying has been shown to increase the risk of lung cancer., Breast cancer patients
    have been shown to be at higher risk for other cancers and should avoid known
    mutagens., 'In addition, it is possible to get the potential health benefits of
    peanuts by consuming other nuts and foods.', 'Although the United States is a
    net exporter of peanuts, the U.S. imports some peanuts, mainly from Argentina,
    China and Mexico.', Peanut oil typically contains a small fraction of the aflatoxins
    contained in peanuts and peanut butter., 'Almond butter, found in health food
    stores and some supermarkets, can often be an acceptable substitute for peanut
    butter.', _Below are links to recent studies concerning this food., 'For a more
