['Like broccoli, cabbage, and brussels sprouts, cauliflower is a brassica (cruciferous)
    vegetable.', 'While cauliflower contains fewer vitamins and minerals than most
    other brassica vegetables, it contains numerous substances with suspected or demonstrated
    cancer fighting properties, including iberin, sinigrin, choline, indole-3-carbinol
    (I3C), 3,3''-diindolylmethane (DIM), and several other glucosinolates.', 'Cauliflower
    or its components have been shown to inhibit urinary bladder, small intestine,
    colorectal and liver carcinogenesis, and reduce the risk of occurrence of gallbladder,
    prostate, lung, urothelial, and cervical cancer.', 'Cauliflower and its component
    molecules have been found to be promote apoptosis, suppress cell cycle progression
    and inhibit angiogenesis of human breast cancer cells.', 'Furthermore, cauliflower
    can protect against cell DNA damage.', 'Consumption of brassica vegetables has
    been shown to reduce the estrogen metabolite 16alpha-hydroxyestrone, which is
    a breast cancer promoter, and to be marginally inversely associated with breast
    cancer risk in a population of premenopausal women.', Cauliflower component I3C
    has been shown increase the anti-cancer effects of the chemotherapy drug Taxol
    (paclitaxel)., We recommend consuming the cancer-fighting components of cauliflower
    and other brassica vegetables as food and against consuming them as "broccoli
    pills" that have been enhanced to boost the proportion of the presumed key anti-cancer
    chemicals in these vegetables., There is some evidence that concentrated cruciferous
    vegetable extracts can act as estrogen agonists and promote breast cancer cell
    proliferation., 'Also, the anticancer properties of cauliflower are likely to
    be the result of synergistic interaction of its various chemical components -
    isolated components have successfully inhibited proliferation in the laboratory,
    but their efficacy and safety in humans needs to be evaluated in large scale clinical
    trials.', _Below are links to recent studies concerning this food., 'For a more
