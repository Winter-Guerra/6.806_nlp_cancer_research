['Sage refers to the leaves of the plant Salvia officinalis, a member of the mint
    family.', 'Sage has been found to have antiseptic, antimicrobial, astringent,
    antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antifungal, antiviral, hypoglycemic, antiatherogenic
    and antimutagenic properties.', 'Sage contains numerous biologically active compounds,
    including caffeic acid, camphor, carnosol, carnosic acid, cineol, epirosmanol,
    galdosol, genistein, isorosmanol, limonene, luteolin, rosmanol, rosmarinic acid,
    thujone, and ursolic acid.', 'Sage has been found to have anti-diabetic effects,
    reducing levels of serum glucose, triglycerides, and total cholesterol, and increasing
    plasma insulin in diabetic rats but not in normal rats.', 'Sage has been shown
    to improve memory retention in both Alzheimer''s patients and college-age subjects,
    however long-term heavy use can cause seizures or other neurological symptoms
    due to sage''s thujone content.', 'Carnosol and carnosic acid, both found in sage,
    have been shown to arrest human colon cancer cell development at different phases
    of the cell cycle.', Carnosol also has been shown to inhibit carcinogenesis of
    human prostate cancer cells., 'Beta-ursolic acid, another sage compound, has been
    shown to inhibit lung colonization of mouse melanoma cells.', Sage has been and
    is used in several folk medicine traditions for its hormonal effects., Sage is
    recommended by some health practitioners to relieve milk oversupply and breast
    engorgement during weaning and it is believed to reduce milk supply by acting
    directly on hormone receptors., 'Similarly, sage is recommended for menopausal
    problems, especially hot flashes and night sweats.', 'Sage is thought to stimulate
    the uterus, and is sometimes used during childbirth and to expel the placenta.',
  'Therefore, sage should be avoided by women who are pregnant, trying to become pregnant,
    or nursing.', Sage's reputed ability to suppress lactation has not been thoroughly
    investigated (this action is not normally associated with phytoestrogens)., Until
    this anti-lactation effect has been explained (and it could mean that sage acts
    against breast cancer) we recommend avoiding all but modest amounts of sage and
    would advise against regular consumption of sage tea., Red sage (Salvia officinalis
    var., rubia) refers to the leaves of a variety of common sage and has essentially
    the same properties as sage., 'Red sage root (also known as salvia root or dan
    shen) refers to the root and rhizome of Salvia miltiorrhiza, another plant in
    the Labiatae family.', 'It is used as in Chinese medicine to treat irregular menstruation,
    cardiovascular problems, and inflammation, and as a tranquilizer, among other
    uses.', "Sage essential oil (sage oil) is used as a food preservative (for example\
    \ in liver p\xE2t\xE9s), however it is greatly diluted during food processing.",
  Sage essential oil is too concentrated to be safely swallowed undiluted and can
    be considered a poison., Sage should be avoided by those who suffer from epilepsy
    or other seizure disorders., Drinking sage tea could potentially increase liver
    damage from some prescription medications and should be avoided by those with
    liver disease., 'Sage-drug interactions may occur when taken with drugs designed
    to treat conditions on which sage appears to act, some psychotropic drugs and
    painkillers, and other drugs (e.g., oxytocin, nalbuphine, bromocriptine mesylate,
    ethionamide).', 'Clearly, caution is advised when combining significant amounts
    of sage or regular sage tea drinking with prescription medications.', Sage should
    be avoided during chemotherapy., _Below are links to recent studies concerning
    this food., 'For a more complete list of studies, please click on sage._']
