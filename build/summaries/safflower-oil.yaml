[Safflower (Carthamus tinctorius L.) oil is a polyunsaturated edible seed oil consisting
    primarily (76%-82%) of the omega-6 fatty acid linoleic acid., Linoleic acid is
    converted into arachidonic acid in the body., Safflower oil has been shown to
    have pro-inflammatory properties., Linoleic acid has been shown to enhance the
    invasion and peritoneal metastasis of gastric carcinoma cells., Safflower oil
    has the highest proportion of linoleic acid of all common cooking oils., 'In addition
    to cancer cell studies, numerous experiments using either carcinogen-induced tumors
    or transplanted mammary tumors in mice have demonstrated that linoleic acid promotes
    mammary tumor development.', Daughter mice of female mice fed a high linoleic
    diet are more prone to develop mammary tumors., "One study reported that women\
    \ with a specific genotype (ALOX5AP \u22124900 A>G polymorphism) who consumed\
    \ a significant amount of linoleic acid in their diets had an increased risk of\
    \ breast cancer.", Another study found increased breast cancer risk among women
    cooking primarily with high linoleic acid vegetable or corn oil compared to women
    using olive or canola oil., Women with breast cancer have been found to have higher
    levels of omega-6 in their breast tissue than similar women without breast cancer.,
  Several studies have found that lower dietary omega-6/omega-3 ratios are associated
    with reduced risk of breast cancer., Consuming safflower oil would tend to increase
    the ratio for most women because of its high omega-6 content., 'Note that while
    we are continually searching for new evidence specifically concerning this food,
    there is not much interest in it among breast cancer researchers, so few studies
    are available.', _Below are links to recent studies concerning this food., 'For
