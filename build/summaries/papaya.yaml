['Papayas (Carica papaya) and their seeds contain substances that have been shown
    to have antihypertensive, antioxidant, anti-amoebic, antiparasitic, antiseptic,
    wound and burn healing, contraceptive and neuroprotective properties, as well
    as improving cholesterol profile and assisting with digestion.', Papaya is a good
    dietary source of vitamin C and vitamin A (through its beta-carotene content).,
  The fruit has been selected to raise levels of vitamin A in children in deficiency-prone
    countries such as Cameroon and Sri Lanka., 'Compounds with known cancer-fighting
    properties found in papayas include carotenoids such as lycopene, beta-carotene
    and cryptoxanthin, as well as several isothiocyanates.', 'The benzyl isothiocyanate
    found in papaya has been shown to induce apoptosis in pancreas, prostate, and
    leukemic cancer cells and to inhibit carcinogen-induced bladder cancer.', 'Benzyl
    isothiocyanate, found in papaya flesh and seeds, has been shown to selectively
    induce apoptosis in human breast cancer cells.', The high carotenoid levels found
    in papayas suggest that consuming the fruit could serve to protect against breast
    cancer., 'However, no population studies have been performed that directly assess
    the effects of papaya on the risk of breast cancer.', 'Papayas are sometimes referred
    to as paw paws, but the paw paw (Asiminia triloba) sold in the U.S. is a different
    fruit.', 'Papayas have two possible flesh colors, yellow and red.', The red color
    of red papaya fruit is due to an accumulation of lycopene; the yellow color of
    yellow papaya is the result of conversion of lycopene to beta-carotene and beta-cryptoxanthin.,
  'Papayas should be eaten ripe, without the skin or seeds.', 'Even though the peel
    is not eaten, papayas should be washed thoroughly before being cut up for consumption
    since potent pesticides typically are used in growing them.', 'Both raw and cooked
    green papayas (i.e., unripe papayas) are used in some Asian cuisines.', 'For example,
    atchara, a Filipino condiment or side dish, is made of primarily of pickled raw
    green papaya.', Ground papaya seeds are used in some cuisines similarly to black
    pepper., 'However, we recommend against consuming green papaya (whether raw, cooked
    or dried) or papaya seeds.', 'Unlike ripe papaya, green papaya contains a high
    concentration of a type of latex that has been shown to produce uterine contractions
    in rats; this may be the basis for the belief in parts of Asia that consumption
    of papaya is unsafe during pregnancy.', 'In fact, green papaya is used for female
    contraception and abortion in some traditional medicine systems.', Papaya seeds
    contain a higher proportion of benzyl isothiocyanate than does the flesh and they
    are sometimes used as part of herbal preparations., 'However, one study found
    that rats consuming papaya seed extract exhibited liver cell damage and precancerous
    liver changes in a dose-dependent manner.', Another study found that benzyl isothiocyanate
    promoted urinary bladder carcinogenesis in rats., 'Papaya seed extracts also have
    been shown to have dose-dependent spermicidal effects, causing human sperm immobilization
    and death.', 'Dried papaya typically has been treated with sulfur dioxide to prevent
    the fruit from oxidizing during and after the drying process, thereby preserving
    its color.', 'However, sulfur dioxide and its derivatives have been shown to increase
    the frequencies of chromosomal aberrations in mammalian cells and cause oxidative
    damage in multiple organs of male and female mice.', 'Therefore, we recommend
    obtaining unsulfured dried fruit where possible.', _Below are links to recent
