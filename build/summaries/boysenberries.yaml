[The evidence that boysenberries could be beneficial in fighting breast cancer is
    derived partly from studies of related berries., Boysenberries are a hybrid of
    blackberry and raspberry., The fact that boysenberries contain substances that
    have been shown to be antiproliferative and antioxidant is well established.,
  'However, few studies have been performed that directly address the effect of consuming
    boysenberries on cancer.', 'Boysenberries contain ellagic acid, which has been
    shown to inhibit cancer formation.', 'Boysenberries are also known to have high
    levels of anthocyanins, which are potent antioxidants.', 'Berry anthocyanins have
    been shown to inhibit proliferation, apoptosis, inflammation and angiogenesis.',
  Loganberries are a hybrid cross between between a blackberry and a raspberry., '_Note
    that while we are continually searching for new evidence concerning this food,
    there is not much interest in it among cancer researchers so few recent studies
    are available._']
