['Like beets and Swiss chard, spinach (Spinacia oleracea) belongs to the amaranth
    family.', 'Spinach is a good dietary source of vitamin A, vitamin B6, vitamin
    C, vitamin D, folate, and vitamin K, as well as iron, manganese and magnesium.',
  'Spinach contains various carotenoids such as beta-carotene and lutein, as well
    as flavonoids such as kaempferol, and a variety of lignans, chlorophylls, and
    glycolipids with suspected or demonstrated cancer fighting properties.', 'Spinach
    has been shown to have anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, neuroprotective, and antimutagenic
    properties, and to protect the eyes from macular degeneration and cataracts.',
  Spinach components have been shown to inhibit growth and proliferation of cervical
    cancer cells in the laboratory and carcinogen-induced colon cancer in mice., 'Dietary
    intake of spinach has been found to be associated with lower risks of head and
    neck, lung, gallbladder, stomach, liver, bladder, prostate and ovarian cancer
    in population studies.', Carotenoids and glycolipids isolated from spinach have
    been demonstrated to cause dose-dependent growth inhibition in breast cancer cells.,
  Several population studies have found that spinach consumption is associated with
    lower risk of breast cancer., Spinach consumption may help counteract the cancer-promoting
    effects of the heme iron in red meat., Baby spinach has higher flavonoid concentration
    than mature spinach., Red spinach (Amaranthus gangeticus) is a plant used in South
    Asian cooking that is closely related to common spinach., 'Based on the few studies
    that have been performed, red spinach appears to have anti-cancer activities similar
    to that of common spinach.', 'Spinach contains oxalic acid, which interferes with
    calcium absorption, and therefore spinach should not be eaten at the same time
    as calcium-rich foods by breast cancer patients and others to whom calcium levels
    are important.', Boiling reduces the oxalic acid content of spinach and increases
    iron availability., Non-organic spinach must be washed very thoroughly to remove
    pesticide residue as much as possible., _Below are links to recent studies concerning
    this food., 'For a more complete list, including less recent studies, please click
