['While there are cheeses on the market made from various oils and from the milk of
    goats, sheep, and other animals, the discussion in this webpage refers to cheese
    made from cow''s milk.', 'Also, "cheese" refers to full-fat cheese rather than
    reduced fat or non-fat cheese.', 'Cheese is a rich dietary source of calcium,
    conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), and stearate, all of which have been shown to
    have anticarcinogenic properties.', Numerous studies have found that the consumption
    of cheese and other high-fat dairy foods is related to lower risk of colon cancer.,
  Cheese consumption also appears to reduce the risks of stomach and pancreatic cancer.,
  'On the other hand, studies indicate that the consumption of cheese may increase
    the risks of developing bladder, testicular, ovarian, and thyroid cancers, as
    well as non-Hodgkin lymphoma.', 'Higher intake of cheese has been associated with
    increases in prostate cancer risk in many, but not all, studies that have examined
    the association.', Cheese consumption also has been found to increase the risk
    of new skin cancer (squamous cell carcinoma) among people with previous skin cancer.,
  'Components of cheese, including calcium, vitamin D, stearate, and CLA have been
    found to induce apoptosis of breast cancer cells or reduce mammary tumor size
    and incidence in the laboratory.', 'However, many (but by no means all) population
    studies have found that cheese consumption is associated with an increased risk
    of breast cancer.', 'The factors that may contribute to this increased risk include
    the fact that much of the milk we drink today is produced from pregnant cows (in
    which estrogen and progesterone levels are markedly elevated), as well as the
    presence of saturated fat, recombinant bovine growth hormone, and various environmental
    contaminants in cheese.', 'High intake of animal fats has been linked in several
    studies to increased breast density, a risk factor for breast cancer and recurrence.',
  'On the other hand, like fermented milk products, consumption of low-fat or non-fat
    cheese may be protective against breast cancer.', CLA has been found to inhibit
    breast cancer in the laboratory at concentrations close to human consumption levels.,
  Several population studies have been performed specifically to evaluate the possible
    association between consumption of CLA in cheese and other dairy products and
    the risk of breast cancer., The study results have been contradictory., 'A large
    prospective Netherlands population study found a weak positive association between
    CLA intake and the risk breast cancer (i.e., the association was in the opposite
    direction expected if CLA was protective) and concluded that the apparent anticarcinogenic
    properties of CLA in animal and tissue culture models had not been confirmed in
    humans.', 'However, an earlier Finnish study of women who already had breast cancer
    found that dietary CLA and levels of CLA in the blood were significantly lower
    in the postmenopausal breast cancer cases than in the postmenopausal controls
    without cancer.', 'Recombinant bovine growth hormone (a synthetic version of the
    bovine growth hormone that occurs naturally in cows), which is administered to
    cows to increase milk production, has been suggested to increase breast cancer
    risk.', The hormone itself is thought to be biologically inactive in humans.,
  'However, it causes the cow liver to produce insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1),
    which enters the blood and milk as well.', The bovine form of IGF-1 is identical
    to the human form., IGF-1 is required for mammary development at puberty and has
    been implicated in increased risk of breast cancer., Several studies have found
    a modest positive association between circulating IGF-I levels and breast cancer
    risk among premenopausal women., 'In fact, substances that inhibit IGF-I action
    in the mammary gland are being developed in the hope that they can eventually
    play a role in breast cancer chemoprevention.', 'Since calcium and vitamin D both
    have been shown to be very significant in protecting against several cancers,
    and since cheese is a major source of both in the typical American diet, it is
    important that those who start to decrease their overall consumption of cheese
    add new sources of calcium and vitamin D.


    While consuming low-fat dairy products may reduce breast cancer risk compared
    to full-fat dairy products, it also can increase the risk of infertility in women
    due to lack of ovulation.', High intake of low-fat dairy foods has been found
    to increase the risk of anovulatory infertility whereas intake of high-fat dairy
    foods has been associated with lower risk., _Below are links to recent studies
    concerning this food., 'For a more complete list of studies, please click on cheese._']
