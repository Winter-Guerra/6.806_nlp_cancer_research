['Corn oil has a relatively high omega-6 fatty acid content, in the form of linoleic
    acid.', Linoleic acid is converted into arachidonic acid in the body., 'Increasing
    consumption of corn oil has been shown in animals studies to be associated with
    higher risks of cancer of the stomach, prostate, pancreas, liver and lung.', 'However,
    note that cornmeal appears to be protective against colon cancer, possibly due
    to its fiber content.', 'Exposure to cooking oil fumes, including corn oil fumes,
    has been shown to increase the risk of lung cancer.', 'One study published in
    2008 attributed the documented increase in the incidence of esophageal cancer
    in the U.S. to increasing carbohydrate consumption, including corn.', 'Various
    studies of non-U.S. populations have found that consumption of corn contaminated
    with fusarium fungi accounts for high levels of esophageal cancer in parts of
    Iran, Brazil, South Africa, and China.', Fusarium fungi produce fumonisins that
    reduce to compounds that synthesize carcinogenic nitrosamines., Fumonisins have
    been found to survive most types of baking and frying., Both fumonisin and aflatoxin
    (also found in corn) levels are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration
    in corn meant for human consumption and animal feed., Numerous studies have shown
    that a diet high in corn oil stimulates the formation of breast tumors in laboratory
    rats., Several experiments also have shown that offspring of rat mothers fed high
    corn oil diets are more likely to develop mammary tumors than offspring of mothers
    fed canola oil diets., The explanations given for these findings are related to
    corn oil's relatively high level of omega-6 fatty acids., "One study reported\
    \ that women with a specific genotype (ALOX5AP \u22124900 A>G polymorphism) who\
    \ consumed a significant amount of linoleic acid in their diets had an increased\
    \ risk of breast cancer.", Another study found increased breast cancer risk among
    women cooking primarily with high linoleic acid vegetable or corn oil compared
    to women using olive or canola oil., Women with breast cancer have been found
    to have higher levels of omega-6 in their breast tissue than similar women without
    breast cancer., Several studies have found that lower dietary omega-6/omega-3
    ratios are associated with reduced risk of breast cancer., Consuming corn oil
    would tend to increase the ratio for most women because of its high omega-6 content.,
  'There is little available information concerning the relationship between the consumption
    of fresh corn, cornmeal, cornstarch and grits and breast cancer risk.', Sweet
    corn contains some melatonin., 'Melatonin protects against breast cancer in several
    ways, including by reducing aromatase activity within the breast, thereby reducing
    estrogen production.', 'Sweet corn and yellow cornmeal contain the carotenoids
    lutein and zeaxanthin, which may have chemopreventive properties.', 'Cornmeal,
    cornstarch and grits do not appear to promote breast cancer directly.', 'However,
    one study found a link between increased starch intake after a diagnosis of early-stage
    breast cancer and a greater risk of recurrence.', _Below are links to recent studies
    concerning this food., 'For a more complete list of studies, please click on corn
