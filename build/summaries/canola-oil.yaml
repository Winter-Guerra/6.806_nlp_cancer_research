['The canola plant was developed in Canada during the 1970s using conventional selective
    breeding and hybrid propagation techniques (i.e., not by genetic modification)
    from turnip rapeseed, black mustard, and leaf mustard.', 'Rapeseed is high in
    erucic acid, an unhealthy fatty acid that is associated with increased risk of
    breast cancer, but the canola plant was developed to minimize this component.',
  Canola oil is made from the pressed seed of the canola plant., Canola oil is low
    in saturated fat and has a high monounsaturated fat content., 'It contains oleic
    acid, linoleic acid and alpha-linolenic acid; the oil is a good source of non-marine
    omega-3 fatty acids.', 'Canola oil is also a dietary source of vitamin E and vitamin
    K.


    Canola oil has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.', 'In one study,
    consumption of canola oil was found to lower LDL-cholesterol and improve endothelial
    function in subjects with peripheral arterial occlusive disease, indicating that
    canola oil might provide cardiovascular protection.', Canola oil was shown to
    prevent diabetic renal injury in diabetic rates in another study., Canola meal
    (which is left over from the seeds after the oil has been extracted) has been
    shown to reduce the tumor incidence and volume of both melanoma and colon cancer
    in mice., Canola oil has been shown to inhibit growth and induce apoptosis in
    both estrogen positive (ER+) and estrogen negative (ER-) human breast cancer cells.,
  'Female mammary gland cancer-prone rats consuming canola oil during pregnancy have
    been found to produce offspring with lower tumor numbers, lower tumor volume and
    lower percentage of mice with tumors than the offspring of mothers on a diet with
    equivalent amounts of corn oil.', Several studies have found that higher omega-3/omega-6
    fatty acid ratios are associated with reduced risk of breast cancer; using canola
    oil would tend to improve the ratio for most women., A 2008 San Francisco population
    study found that women cooking mainly with olive/canola oil have a lower risk
    of breast cancer than those cooking with vegetable/corn oil or hydrogenated fats.,
  'Frying with canola oil (especially deep frying or wok frying) has been shown to
    release carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the cooking oil
    smoke and fumes (this is true of soybean oil, corn oil, peanut oil, and sunflower
    oil as well).', Breathing such fumes should be avoided since this has been associated
    with increased risk of lung cancer in several population studies., 'While the
    canola plant was developed using conventional methods, the majority of current
    canola production comes from genetically modified plants developed for their resistance
    to herbicides.', Organic canola oil is available for those concerned about consuming
    genetically modified foods., 'Possibly because of its connection with rapeseed
    oil, canola oil has been the subject of many alarming negative (and false) health-related
    claims, especially on the internet.', 'As mentioned above, rapeseed oil is high
    in erucic acid (30 to 60 percent) and should be avoided (canola oil contains between
    0.3 and 1.2 percent erucic acid, an acceptable amount).', Rapeseed oil normally
    is not sold in U.S. supermarkets but it can be found as an ingredient in some
    processed foods such as commercial peanut butter., 'Be aware that in Europe, canola
    oil is referred to as rape oil or rapeseed oil but it is, in fact, canola oil.',
