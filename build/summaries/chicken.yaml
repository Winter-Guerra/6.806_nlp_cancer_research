['Chicken is an excellent dietary source of niacin, and vitamin B6, and also contains
    vitamin B-12, vitamin D, iron, selenium and zinc.', Chicken is far lower in saturated
    fat and cholesterol than red meat., White chicken and turkey meat contains less
    fat and iron than the dark meat of the legs and thighs., 'Consumption of chicken
    and other poultry have been found to be associated with reduced risks of head
    and neck, pancreatic, bladder, ovarian and colorectal cancer.', 'In some of the
    studies, these inverse associations were found to be stronger for consumption
    of skinless chicken or chicken that had not been grilled or fried.', 'On the other
    hand, chicken and poultry consumption have also been associated with increased
    risks of thyroid cancer.', 'Chicken and poultry consumption have been found in
    numerous studies to be associated with lower risk of breast cancer, although not
    all published research is consistent on this point.', 'Consumption of white meat
    was associated with lower breast density, a strong breast cancer risk factor,
    in one study.', Another large prospective study reported that adolescent poultry
    intake was associated with lower risk of breast cancer in adulthood., "The associations\
    \ might be a result of food substitution \x97 eating chicken rather than red meat\
    \ reduces the proportion of red meat in the diet.", 'For those who eat meat, organic
    chicken is a much better choice than beef, pork or processed meat.', 'The method
    of preparation appears to be important; very well done barbecued chicken, deep
    fried chicken, grilled well done chicken with skin, and pan-fried chicken all
    have been found to contain unacceptably high levels of heterocyclic amines (HCAs)
    and benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), which are known carcinogens.', Chicken gravy made with
    pan drippings is also not recommended., Population studies that examined cooking
    methods have found consumption of deep fried chicken and chicken with skin to
    be associated with increased breast cancer risk., 'Based on the available evidence,
    organic skinless chicken that has not been charred or cooked using a high-heat
    method may offer some protection against breast cancer or at least not increase
    risk.', 'To avoid potential food poisoning from contamination with E. coli or
    salmonella, chicken should always be fully cooked.', 'Processed poultry meat such
    as smoked turkey, turkey bacon, and chicken sausage containing sodium nitrite
    should be avoided (see the discussion of processed meats in bacon).', Other processed
    chicken food products such as chicken nuggets are also not recommended., We recommend
    purchasing certified organic chicken and other poultry., Chickens typically are
    raised in factory farms under extremely confined and unsanitary conditions that
    require use of antibiotics and antimicrobial drugs to maintain the health of the
    birds and maximize their growth., 'For example, some chicken producers use roxarsone,
    an arsenic compound, to control parasites.', 'While the use of hormones to stimulate
    growth is not legal in poultry, nonorganic chicken meat (especially the fat) has
    been found to contain relatively high levels of estrogen, presumably from high
    protein feeds derived from soy.', 'Factory farmed chickens typically are administered
    feed pellets, which are less desirable than organic grain and food that chickens
    obtain themselves when pastured (i.e., the grass, seeds, worms, and beetles that
    chickens find when scratching and pecking).', 'Certified Organic and Humane Raised
    & Handled chicken would be the best choice for consumers who want to purchase
    meat from birds that are humanely raised and free from antibiotics, insecticides,
    and other additives, as well as animal byproducts in the feed.', _Below are links
    to recent studies concerning this food., 'For a list of studies that includes
    less recent research, please click on chicken._']
