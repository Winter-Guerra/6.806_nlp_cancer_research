['Onions, garlic and other members of the allium genus such as leeks, chives, scallions
    and shallots have been shown to have antimicrobial, radioprotective, antithrombotic,
    hypolipidaemic, anti-inflammatory, antiarthritic and hypoglycemic effects, as
    well as improving immune function.', 'Allium vegetables contain various substances
    reported to have anti-cancer effects, including quercetin, apigenin, fisetin,
    myricetin, kaempferol, ajoene, diallyl disulfide and related chemicals, S-allylcysteine,
    dipropyl, and various thiosulfinates.', Garlic is a good dietary source of the
    lignan enterolactone., 'Garlic has been shown to decrease DNA strand breaks induced
    by carcinogens, inhibit DNA and RNA synthesis in human cancer cells, retard the
    growth of cancer cells by causing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, and suppress
    angiogenesis.', 'Epidemiological studies have demonstrated an association between
    increased consumption of allium vegetables and a reduction in many different types
    of cancer, including cancer of the prostate, lung, endometrium, stomach, colon,
    bladder, esophagus, larynx, mouth, ovary, and liver, as well as melanoma, acute
    myeloid leukemia, and childhood acute leukemia.', 'Numerous studies have shown
    that onions, garlic and their components inhibit proliferation, reduces migration
    and invasiveness, and induces apoptosis of cultured human breast cancer cells.',
  One large European study found that eating onions and garlic was associated with
    lower risk of breast cancer., Another large Italian population-based study found
    a relationship between the consumption of increasing intake of flavones and flavonols
    found in allium vegetables and a reduction in the risk of breast cancer., A study
    of women in Mexico City found that consuming more than one slice of onion per
    day was associated with reduced risk of breast cancer., A Korean study found an
    association between onion and garlic consumption and lower incidence of breast
    cancer., 'However, there were no clear associations found between breast cancer
    risk and the consumption of onions or of individual flavonols in a study of premenopausal
    women in the Nurses Health Study II.', 'The anti-carcinogenic effect of allium
    vegetables is attributed in part to organosulfur compounds, which are generated
    upon cutting or chewing of these vegetables.', 'Although some of the anticancer
    benefits of garlic are retained after cooking or processing it, raw garlic appears
    to have the most benefits.', 'Leeks and yellow onions are a very good source of
    quercetin, which has been shown increase the anti-cancer effects of the chemotherapy
    drug Taxol (paclitaxel).', 'Garlic is a good source of apigenin, which also has
    been shown to increase the effectiveness of Taxol.', Garlic has also been shown
    to have protective effects against Adriamycin (doxorubicin)-induced heart damage.,
  'However, garlic supplementation has been shown to reduce the clearance of the chemotherapy
    drug Taxotere (docetaxel) in some (typically, African-American) women, a result
    that might also hold for Taxol.', _Below are links to recent studies concerning
