# Isolation of a Ribonuclease with Antiproliferative and HIV-1 Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitory Activities from Japanese Large Brown Buckwheat Seeds

## Abstract

A ribonuclease, with a molecular mass of 22.5 kDa and an N-terminal sequence exhibiting resemblance to previously isolated buckwheat storage proteins and allergens, was isolated from Japanese large brown buckwheat seeds. The ribonuclease was purified using a simple protocol that comprised ion exchange chromatography on Q-Sepharose and DEAE-cellulose and gel filtration on Superdex 75. The ribonuclease exhibited low activity toward poly U, lower activity toward poly C, and very low activity toward poly A and poly G. The enzyme was activated upon exposure to 10 mM of Fe2+ and Zn2+ ions but was inhibited by Ca2+, Mg2+, and Mn2+ ions at the same concentration. The optimum pH and optimum temperature for the enzyme were pH 9 and 60 °C, respectively. It inhibited proliferation of HepG2 hepatoma and MCF 7 breast cancer cells, with an IC50 value of 79.2 and 63.8 μM, respectively. It potently inhibited HIV-1 reverse transcriptase activity with an IC50 of 48 μM. However, there were no antifungal and mitogenic activities.

## Introduction

Ribonucleases have been isolated from a diversity of organisms including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals. In mammals, ribonuclease is distributed in various organs comprising the brain, liver, kidney, and pancreas and in different secretions comprising semen and milk [6]. The enzyme displays multiple activities such as antiviral [48], anti-HIV reverse transcriptase [40, 50], antifungal [35], and antitumor [31] activities. Plant ribonucleases play an important role in fundamental physiological processes including senescence, phosphate starvation response, and cell death pathways [4].

In view of the fact that different ribonucleases have distinct amino acid sequences and that many of the ribonuscleases reported in the literature were not assayed for biological activities other than ribonucleolytic activity, we undertook the present study to isolate a ribonuclease from Japanese large brown buckwheat seeds. It was assayed for different biological activities, including antiproliferative activity toward HepG2 hepatoma cells and MCF 7 breast cancer cells, mitogenic activity toward mouse splenocytes, antifungal activity, and inhibitory activity toward HIV-1 reverse transcriptase.

## Materials and Methods

### Purification of Ribonuclease

Japanese large brown buckwheat seeds (500 g) were purchased from a Japanese vendor and homogenized in distilled water using a blender. The homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000_g_ for 30 min at 4 °C. Tris–HCl buffer (pH 7.2) was added to the resulting supernatant until the concentration of Tris attained 10 mM. The supernatant was then chromatographed on a 5 cm × 20 cm column of Q-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) in 10 mM Tris–HCl buffer (pH 7.2) with a flow rate of 4.1 ml/min. After the flowthrough fraction Q1 had been removed, the column was eluted stepwise with 0.2 M NaCl, 0.5 M NaCl, and then with 1 M NaCl added to the starting buffer. The fraction (Q2) eluted with 0.5 M NaCl in the starting buffer was dialyzed against 10 mM NH4HCO3 buffer (pH 9.3) at 4 °C overnight before chromatography on a 2.5 cm × 20 cm column of DEAE-cellulose (Sigma) in the same buffer. After the flowthrough fraction (D1) had been eluted, the column was eluted with a linear 0–1 M NaCl gradient in 10 mM NH4HCO3 buffer (pH 9.3) with a flow rate of 3.3 ml/min. Fraction D1 was then dialyzed, lyophilized, and subjected to gel filtration on a Superdex 75 HR 10/30 column (GE Healthcare) in 20 mM NH4HCO3 buffer (pH 9.3) with a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min using an AKTA Purifier (GE Healthcare). The first fraction represented purified ribonuclease.

### Molecular Mass Determination by Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis and by FPLC-gel Filtration

Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was carried out in accordance with the procedure of Laemmli and Favre [19], using a 12 % resolving gel and a 5 % stacking gel. At the end of electrophoresis, the gel was stained with Coomassie brilliant blue. FPLC-gel filtration was carried out using a Superdex 75 HR 10/30 column that had been calibrated with molecular-mass standards (GE Healthcare).

### Analysis of N-Terminal Amino Acid Sequence

Amino acid sequence analysis was carried out using an HP G1000A Edman degradation unit and an HP1000 HPLC system (Hewlett-Packard).

### Assay for Ribonuclease Activity

The activity of purified ribonuclease toward yeast tRNA (Sigma) was assayed by determining the generation of acid-soluble, UV-absorbing species with the method of Wang and Ng [36]. The RNase was incubated with 200 μg tRNA in 150 μl of 100 mM MES buffer (pH 6.0) at 37 °C for 1 h. The reaction was terminated by introduction of 25 μl of ice-cold 3.4 % perchloric acid. After leaving on ice for 15 min, the sample was centrifuged (15,000_g_, 15 min) at 4 °C. The OD260 of the supernatant was read after appropriate dilution. One unit of enzymatic activity is defined as the amount of enzyme that brings about an increase in OD260 of one per minute in the acid-soluble fraction per milliliter of reaction mixture under the specified conditions. Effects of pH and temperature on ribonuclease activity were tested as described in Xia et al. [40].

### Activity of RNase Toward Polyhomoribonucleotides

The ribonucleolytic activity of purified ribonuclease toward polyhomoribonucleotides was determined with a modification of the method of Wang and Ng [36]. Incubation of RNase with 100 μg of poly A, poly C, poly G, or poly U in 250 μl of 100 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0) was carried out at 37 °C for 1 h, prior to addition of 250 μl of ice-cold 1.2 N perchloric acid containing 20 mM lanthanum nitrate to terminate the reaction. After standing on ice for 15 min, the sample was centrifuged at 15,000_g_ for 15 min at 4 °C. The absorbance of the supernatant, after appropriate dilution, was read at 260 nm (in the case of poly A, poly G, and poly U) or at 280 nm (in the case of poly C) [40].

### Assay of Mitogenic Activity Toward Mouse Splenocytes

This assay was carried out with the approval of the Animal Research Ethics Committee, The Chinese University of Hong Kong. It was conducted since it has previously been reported that some ribonucleases exhibit activity toward mouse splenocytes [25]. Four C57BL/6 mice (20–25 g) were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and the spleens were aseptically removed. Splenocytes were isolated by pressing the tissue through a sterilized 100-mesh stainless steel sieve and resuspended to 5 × 106 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 culture medium supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum, 100 U penicillin/ml, and 100 μg streptomycin/ml. The splenocytes (7 × 105 cells/100 μl/well) were seeded into a 96-well culture plate, and serial concentrations of the ribonuclease in 100-μl medium were added. Following incubation of the splenocytes at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5 % CO2 in the presence or absence of the purified ribonuclease for 24 h, 10 μl methyl [3H]-thymidine (0.25 μCi, GE Healthcare) was added, and the splenocytes were incubated for another 6 h under the same conditions. The splenocytes were then harvested with an automated cell harvester onto a glass fiber filter, and the radioactivity was measured with a Beckman model LS 6000SC scintillation counter. All reported values are the means of triplicate samples [40].

### Assay of Antiproliferative Activity on Tumor Cell Lines

This assay was performed since it has been reported that some ribonucleases manifest this activity [25]. The antiproliferative activity of the purified RNase was determined as follows. MCF7 (breast adenocarcinoma) and HepG2 (hepatoma) cells were cultured in RPMI medium supplemented with 10 % (_v_/_v_) fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 mg/l streptomycin, and 100 U/ml penicillin at 37 °C and in a humidified atmosphere of 5 % (_v_/_v_) CO2. Cells were subsequently seeded into 96-well plates with a density of 2 × 103 cells/well and incubated for 24 h. Different concentrations of the RNase in 100 μl complete RPMI medium were then added to the wells and incubated for 72 h. After that, [3-[4,5-dimethythiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] (MTT) quantification assays were carried out to measure viability of the cells. Briefly, 20 μl of a 5 mg/ml MTT in phosphate-buffered saline was spiked into each well, and the plates were incubated for 4 h. The plates were then centrifuged at 2,500 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant was carefully removed, and 150 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide was added in each well to dissolve the MTT formazan formed at the bottom of the wells. After 10 min, absorbance at 590 nm was measured with a microplate reader. As a control, PBS instead of RNase was added into the wells [40].

### Assay for HIV Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitory Activity

This assay was executed out since it has previously been reported that some ribonucleases display this activity [40]. The assay for ability to inhibit HIV-1 reverse transcriptase was carried out by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit from Boehringer Mannheim (Germany) as described by Xia et al. [40].

### Assay of Antifungal Activity

This assay [35] was performed since it has previously been reported that some ribonucleases demonstrate this activity [35]. The fungal species tested were _Fusarium oxysporum_, _Helminthosporium maydis_, and _Mycosphaerella arachidicola_.

## Results

### Purification of Ribonuclease

When the crude extract of Japanese brown buckwheat seeds was fractionated on Q-Sepharose, ribonuclease activity resided in the second adsorbed fraction Q2 (Fig. 1a). Ion exchange chromatography of Q2 on DEAE-cellulose yielded two adsorbed fractions, D1 and D2 (Fig. 1b). Ribonuclease activity was present mainly in fraction D1 (Table 1). Ribonuclease activity was observed in the first peak S1 (Fig. 2a) when fraction D1 was chromatographed on Superdex 75. It constituted purified ribonuclease.

### Molecular Mass and N-Terminal Sequence of Isolated Ribonuclease

The molecular mass as estimated by gel filtration was 22 kDa (Fig. 2a). There was an approximately 10-fold increase in specific activity (Table 1). In SDS-PAGE, it displayed a single band with a molecular mass of 22.5 kDa (Fig. 2b).

The N-terminal sequence of buckwheat RNase resembled a partial sequence at some distance away from the C-terminus of the legumin-like protein (accession No. BAA21758) (80 % identity) and allergenic protein (accession number ABI 32184) (73 % identity) which are much larger in size than buckwheat RNase. However, it was similar in size as well as N-terminal sequence to allergenic protein (accession No. AAK 97787) (73 % identity) and storage protein (accession No. AAF 34634) (73 % identity) (Table 2).

RNases from barley (_Hordeum vulgare_), maize (_Zea mays_), _Ricinus communis_, and _Zinnia elegans_ resembled one another in N-terminal sequence and molecular size. However, they showed only slight similarity (20 % identity) to buckwheat RNase (Table 2).

### Ribonuclease Activity of Isolated Protein

Its activity toward yeast tRNA revealed a steady increase when the pH was varied from 2 to 9, and an abrupt decline when the pH was further elevated above 9 (data not shown). Optimal activity was found at 60 °C, and the activity was relatively stable until 66 °C (data not shown). The purified RNase exhibited ribonucleolytic activity toward poly U, poly G, poly A, and poly C: 86.6, 37.2, 21.4, and 0.2 U/ mg, respectively. The activity of the ribonuclease was stimulated by 10 μM Fe2+ and 10 μM Zn2+ ions but inhibited in the presence of a variety of other divalent cations at micromole concentrations including Ca2+, Mg2+, and Mn2+ ions (data not shown).

### Other Biological Activities of Isolated Ribonuclease

The ribonuclease was devoid of mitogenic activity toward mouse spleen cells and antifungal activity (data not shown). It inhibited the activity of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase and the proliferation of hepatoma HepG2 cells and breast cancer MCF7 cells with IC50 values of 48 μM (Fig. 3a) and 79.2 and 63.8 μM (Fig. 3b), respectively.

## Discussion

Ribonucleases are defense proteins because they hydrolyze RNAs of invading foreign pathogens. In fact, some ribonucleases have antifungal activity [35]. Some antifungal proteins such as thaumatin-like proteins [14, 33] and chitinases [29] are allergens. It is noteworthy that the buckwheat RNase isolated in the present study resembles some allergens and storage proteins [46] previously reported from buckwheat in N-terminal amino acid sequence. It has been shown that other seed proteins such as antifungal proteins [10] and trypsin inhibitors [27] may also be allergens. Hence, it is possible that some RNases may also manifest allergenic activity. A gene FAO2 encoding legumin-like proteins and expressed during seed development in buckwheat is identical to the N-terminal amino acid domain of BW 24 kD, a major buckwheat allergen [34]. However, there are other allergenic proteins from buckwheat such as trypsin inhibitors [27] which are different in sequence from the aforementioned buckwheat RNase and allergenic proteins.

Bufe et al. [5] have demonstrated that the major allergen from timothy grass pollen, Phlp5b (_Phleum pratense_), is a single-stranded, sugar-nonspecific nuclease with topoisomerase activity. Whether the enzymatic activity is responsible for induction of the allergic sensitization and inflammation remains uncertain. Thus, it seems likely that buckwheat RNase is also an allergen.

The RNase activity of barley nuclease is higher toward purine ribonucleotides than pyrimidine ribonucleotides, and the ranking of potency toward polyhomoribonucleotides is poly C &gt; poly U &gt; poly A &gt; poly G [4]. Tobacco (_Nicotiana glutinosa_) RNase shows preference for poly G [15]. Lentil seedling RNase shows the following ranking of potencies toward polyhomoribonucleotides: poly U &gt; poly A &gt; poly C &gt; poly G [16]. Endonuclease from _Agropyron elongatum_ seedlings shows the following ranking of potencies toward polyhomoribonucleotides: poly U &gt; poly A &gt; poly G &gt; polyC [42]. Buckwheat RNase shows similarity in polyhomoribonucleotide specificity (poly C &gt; poly U &gt; poly A &gt; poly G) to barley RNase [4].

The activity of buckwheat RNase is stimulated by Zn2+ ions. On the other hand, _Pleurotus sajor-caju_ RNase is inhibited by Zn2+ ions [25]. Buckwheat RNase (22 kDa) is slightly smaller in molecular mass than the 26 kDa. _Antirrbinum_ RNase [20] has a much smaller size than the 33-kDa barley RNase [4] and the 35-kDa pea RNase [18].

The amphibian RNase onconase promotes activation-induced apoptosis of lymphocytes and thus may be clinically useful as an immunomodulating agent to suppress transplant rejection or treat autoimmune diseases [12]. Angiogenin, one of the ribonucleases in milk, modulates the mitogenic response of nonimmune cells including bovine adrenal capillary endothelial (BACE), rat aortic smooth muscle (RASM), and fibroblast (3T3) cells [13, 32]. In contrast to the RNase from _Pleurotus sajor-caju_ which exhibits antimitogenic activity toward splenocytes [25], buckwheat RNase lacks mitogenic activity. RNase from brown oyster mushroom is also devoid of mitogenic activity [40].

Bovine seminal and pancreatic RNases demonstrate antitumor activity [21]. Onconase and amphinase from leopard frog _Rana pipiens_ also exhibit antitumor activity [1]. Mung bean (_Phaseolus aureus_) sprout nuclease shows antitumor and aspermatogenic activities [31]. RNase from the mushroom _Pleurotus sajor-caju_ exerts antiproliferative activities toward hepatoma HepG2 cells and leukemia L1210 cells with an IC50 of 0.22 and 0.1 μM, respectively [25]. RNases from the mushrooms _Agrocybe cylindracea_ [24], _Hypsizigus marmoreus_ [11], _Russula delica_ [47], _Lyophyllum shimeiji_ [45], _Pleurotus djamor_ [39], _Lactarius flavidulus_ [38], _Tuber indicum_ [41], and _Hohenbuehelia serotina_ [44] also demonstrate antiproliferative activity against tumor cells including leukemia, lymphoma, breast cancer, and hepatoma cells. Most of the plant ribonucleases have not been tested for antitumor activity. However, bitter gourd RNases display antitumor activity against HepG 2 and MCF 7 cancer cells in vitro as well as in vivo [7, 8]. Likewise, buckwheat RNase manifests antiproliferative activity on HepG 2 and MCF 7 cancer cells.

Ribonucleases from Chinese ginseng _Panax ginseng_ [23], American ginseng _Panax quinquefolium_ [35], milk [22] and mushrooms _Ramaria formosa_, _Hohenbuehelia serotina_, and _Hygrophorus russula_ [43, 44] exhibit HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitory activity; Buckwheat RNase also inhibits HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. The mechanism probably involves protein–protein interactions as in the case of inhibition of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase by HIV-1 protease [3] and inhibition of HIV-1 protease by cathelicidin fragments [37].

RNases from tomato, hop, _Arabis brassica_ [28], and wheat leaves [30] manifest anticancer activity. Nevertheless, the bulk of plant ribonucleases isolated earlier, e.g., RNases from Chinese ginseng [23] and American ginseng [35] have not been assayed for antiproliferative activity toward tumor cells. Only some e.g. RNases from Chinese ginseng [23] and American ginseng [35] have been assayed for HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitory activity. Buckwheat RNase exhibits both types of activities. It has a molecular mass similar to that of bitter gourd RNase [9].

Rice pathogen-related protein 10 (PR-10) is a ribonuclease and is induced by biotic and abiotic stresses [17]. The PR-10 proteins exhibiting RNase activity encompass those from birch pollen [5], white lupin [2], cotton [49], and pepper [26]. Buckwheat RNase is an antipathogenic protein by virtue of its antitumor and anti-HIV reverse transcriptase activities.

In summary, an RNase with potentially exploitable activities, including antiproliferative and anti-HIV reverse transcriptase activities, has been isolated from Japanese large buckwheat seeds.
