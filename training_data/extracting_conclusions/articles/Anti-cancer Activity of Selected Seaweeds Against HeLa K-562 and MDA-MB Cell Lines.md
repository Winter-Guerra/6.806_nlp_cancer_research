# Anti-cancer Activity of Selected Seaweeds Against HeLa, K-562 and MDA-MB Cell Lines

## Abstract

Anticancer activity of marine macro algae (seaweeds) _Sargassum wightii, Ulva fasciata_ and _Gracillaria corticata_ against HeLa, K-562 and MDA-MB cell lines was studied. During the present investigation crude extracts of seaweeds were prepared using soxhlet apparatus. Hexane, Butanol and Methanol were used as solvents. Crude extracts were dissolved in DMSO. In vitro anticancer activity of seaweeds at various concentrations (12.5–200 μg/ml) was studied against the chosen cell lines using MTT assay (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, a yellow tetrazole). Butanolic extract of _Gracillaria corticata_ (200 µg/ml) has shown greater anticancer activity than hexane and methanolic extracts of _G. corticata_ and butanol, hexane and methanolic extracts of _Sargassum wightii_ and _Ulva fasciata_.

## 4.1 Introduction

Cancer is one of the most dreaded diseases accounting for death of more than 3,500 people per million population around the world. Although Chemotherapy is the best option available for the treatment of cancer, its severe side effects cannot be ignored. This has necessitated the search for alternative anticancer drugs having better efficacy with minimum side effects. This search turned the focus towards the marine macro algae which are tremendous reserve sources of pharmacologically efficient compounds [1, 2].

Marine macro algae, the seaweeds, constitute significant proportion of plant biomass of the marine ecosystem and reside at the intertidal zone, which is highly dynamic in nature. Till date, more than 2,400 marine bioactive compounds have been isolated from the seaweeds of subtropical and tropical populations [3]. Recent studies reveal that they possess antiviral, antibacterial, antifungal and antitumor activity [4]. Depending on the pigments seaweeds are broadly classified into chlorophyta, pheophyta and rhodophyta. The seaweeds _Sargassum wightii_, _Ulva fasciata_ and _Gracillaria corticata_, belonging to the family pheophyceae, chlorophyceae and rhodophyceae respectively were tested for their anticancer activity. Crude extracts of the above three seaweeds prepared in hexane, butanol and methanol were used against HeLa-2 (cervical Cancer), K-562 (leukemia) and MDA-MB-231 (Breast cancer) cell lines using MTT assay during the investigation.

## 4.2 Materials and Methods

### 4.2.1 Sample Collection and Preparation

Rao and Sreeramulu [5] described the seaweeds of Visakhapatnam coast. Selected sea weeds were procured from the intertidal region of Bay of Bengal at Visakhapatnam, and the samples were identified by following the standard procedure [6, 7]. They were brought to the laboratory in polythene bags and thoroughly cleaned with sea water followed by distilled water to remove sand, salt and epiphytes. Samples were shade dried and coarse powdered.

### 4.2.2 Preparation of Extracts

Sample and the solvents were taken in 1:10 ratio and soxhaltion had been performed by using hexane, butanol and methanol. Crude extracts were concentrated by rotary evaporator at 45–50 °C. The resulting extracts were dissolved in Di Methyl Sulphoxide (DMSO) and kept in freezer for further use.

### 4.2.3 Cell Lines and Culture Condition

HeLa, K-562 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines were purchased from National Council for Cell Sciences (NCCS) Pune. Cell lines were re-suspended in Minimum Essential Medium (MEM) medium and culture flasks were incubated in 5 % CO2 incubator at 37 °C for 2–3 days.

### 4.2.4 MTT (3-(4, 5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-Diphenyltetrazolium Bromide) Assay

Above three cell lines were added into 96 wells plate at a concentration of 2 × 104 cells/ml and to each well 20 µl of MEM was added. The plates were incubated over night in 5 % CO2 incubator at 37 °C. Algal crude extracts of different concentrations of 12.5, 25, 50, 100, 200 µg/ml were prepared in DMSO. The cell lines were treated with 50 µl of the algal crude extracts of above different concentrations. Blank well had only media. Control cell lines were run without addition of crude extracts. All the plates were incubated for 24 h. After incubation 20 µl of freshly prepared MTT solution (5 mg/ml in Phosphate Buffer Saline) was added in each well and incubated for 4 h to allow the MTT to be metabolized. Media was discarded after incubation. Formozan (metabolic product of MTT) that was left in the well was re-suspended in 200 µl DMSO. The plates were placed on a shaking table at 150 rpm for 5 min for thorough mixing of Formozan into DMSO. The amount of MTT-Formozan that is directly proportional to the number of living cells was determined by reading the optical density (OD) at 420 nm.

## 4.3 Results

Results of in vitro anticancer activity of hexane, butanol and methanolic extracts of _S. wightii_, _U. fasciata_ and _G. corticata_ against HeLa, K-562 and MDA-MB Cell Lines, are given in Tables 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3. The same are shown in Figs. 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3. Crude extracts showed increase in inhibition of cell lines (antitumor activity) with increase of concentration. At minimal (12.5 µg/ml) concentration cell inhibition was observed to be below 10 %. At 50–200 µg/ml a 20–50 % greater inhibition was noticed. Maximum inhibition was observed at 200 µg/ml.


Percentage of inhibition against HeLa cell lines by different concentrations of crude extracts of the three seaweeds  



Percentage of inhibition against MDA-MB 231 cell lines by different concentrations of crude extracts of the three seaweeds  



Percentage of inhibition against K-562 cell lines by different concentrations of crude extracts of the three seaweeds  








Butanolic, hexane and methanolic extracts of _G. corticata_ and _U. fasciata_ had shown more than 50 % inhibition against MDA-MB 531. Butanol and hexane extracts of _G. corticata_ have inhibited 50 % of K-562 and 40 % of HeLa cell line growth respectively. Effect of _S. wightii_ and _U. fasciata_ is below 30 %.

## 4.4 Discussion

Marine environment is a source of potential bioactive compound [8–12]. The green algae are known for their antibacterial, antiviral, antioxidative, and antiproliferative properties [13–16]. In our observation also _U. fasciata_ has shown 50 % cell inhibition against K-562 and MDA-MB 531 cell lines where as the inhibitory effect against HeLa cell lines is very low. Our data reveals that butanolic and hexane extracts of _U. fasciata_ are found to be more effective against K-562 while methanolic extract is effective against the MDA-MB 531 cell lines.

Brown algae which possesses sulphated polysaccharides [17, 18] and fucosidian are very good source of anticoagulant, antibacterial and antioxidant as well as antitumourogenic compounds. Different organic and aqueous extracts of _Sargassum_ sp. were reported for their anticancer properties [19]. Present data showed that Butanolic and methanolic extracts of _S. wightii_ are effective against K-562 and MDA-MB 531 cell lines. Hexane extract has shown the minimum cytotoxicity. The compounds which are responsible for biological activity might be moderate polar in nature.

Earlier reports show that _Gracillaria_ sp. ethanolic, chloroform and aqueous extracts inhibited cell viability [20]. In our study _G. corticata_ organic solvent extracts also inhibited more than 50 % of the cell proliferation of HeLa, K-562, and MDA-MB 531 cell lines.

## 4.5 Conclusion

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) may be one of the causative agents of cancer that damages DNA leading to mutagenesis. Antioxidants are the compounds which scavenge ROS [21]. Previous literature suggests the presence of poly phenols [22], carotenoids, sulfated polysaccharides, terpenoids, flavonoids, phycocolloids, alkaloids, sterols [23] in marine algae which act as the potent source of antioxidants. In our studies _Gracillaria corticata_ has been the most effective inhibitor of cancer cell lines. Therefore _Gracillaria corticata_ may be containing the above substances which are nonpolar and moderate polar. Further investigation has to be done to identify, isolate, and evaluate the specific compounds which are responsible for anticancer activity and in vivo studies have to be carried out to check their cytotoxicity on normal cells.
