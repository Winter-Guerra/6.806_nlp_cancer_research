# Polyphenols from blueberries modulate inflammation cytokines in LPS-induced RAW264.7 macrophages

## Abstract

Polyphenols including 3-glucoside/arabinoside/galactoside-based polymers of delphinidins, petunidins, peonidins, malvidins and cyanidins are one type of biological macromolecules, which are extraordinarily rich in blueberries. Anti-inflammatory activity of blueberry polyphenols (BPPs) was investigated by using lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced RAW264.7 macrophages. The results showed that BPPs suppressed the gene expression of IL-1Î² (interleukin-1Î²), IL-6 and IL-12p35. The inhibition effect on IL-1Î² and IL-6 mRNA was most obvious at the concentration of 10-200 Î¼g/mL BPPs. But the inhibition effect on IL-12p35 mRNA was increased with the increasing concentration of BPPs. When fixed at 100 Î¼g/mL BPPs, the most significant inhibition on IL-1Î², IL-6 and IL-12p35 mRNA expression was detected at 12-48 h. In conclusion, BPPs exhibit anti-inflammation activity by mediating and modulating the balances in pro-inflammatory cytokines of IL-1Î², IL-6, and IL-12.
