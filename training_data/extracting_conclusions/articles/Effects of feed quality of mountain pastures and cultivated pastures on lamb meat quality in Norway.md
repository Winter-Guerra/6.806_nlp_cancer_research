# Effects of feed quality of mountain pastures and cultivated pastures on lamb meat quality in Norway

### Abstract

Norwegian lamb meat production is mainly based on free grazing in mountainous pastures during the summer. Prior to slaughter in the autumn, some lambs not big enough for slaughter are finished on, e.g., cultivated pastures. This study looked at the feed quality of different forages, and the effect on lamb meat quality. Lambs grazed on mountain pastures at Kvaløya in Northern Norway (69°N) and Sør-Fron in Mid Norway (58°N) in 2007, and a subgroup at each location was finished on cultivated pastures for 6 weeks prior to slaughter in September. The fibre content was significantly higher in the cultivated pasture in Mid Norway compared to the mountain pasture, while no differences between pastures in Northern Norway were found. In Mid Norway the content of polyunsaturated fatty acid (18:3) was significantly higher in meat from lambs grazing the mountain pasture compared to lamb grazing the cultivated pasture. For Northern Norway, the opposite pattern was observed. The higher 18:3 content may be attributable to lower fibre content at the mountain pasture in Mid Norway. In our study, there appears to be an effect of fibre content on the fatty acid composition in lamb meat.
