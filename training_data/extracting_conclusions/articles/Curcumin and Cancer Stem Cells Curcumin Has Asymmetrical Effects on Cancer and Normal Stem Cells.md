# Curcumin and Cancer Stem Cells: Curcumin Has Asymmetrical Effects on Cancer and Normal Stem Cells

### Abstract

Curcumin has been shown to have numerous cytotoxic effects on cancer stem cells (CSCs). This is due to its suppression of the release of cytokines, particularly interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8 and IL-1, which stimulate CSCs, and also to its effects at multiple sites along CSC pathways, such as Wnt, Notch, Hedgehog and FAK. In spite of its multiple actions targeting CSCs, curcumin has little toxicity against normal stem cells (NSCs). This may be due to curcumin's different effects on CSCs and NSCs.
