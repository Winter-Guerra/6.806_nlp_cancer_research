# Diallyl sulfide inhibits diethylstilbestrol induced DNA damage in human breast epithelial cells (MCF-10A)

## Abstract

Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in women in the United States. Diethylstilbestrol (DES) is a synthetic estrogen that has been shown to cause cancer in animals and humans, altering cell viability as well as inducing DNA damage. Diallyl sulfide (DAS) is a garlic organosulfide that has been shown to inhibit both the initiation and promotion phases of cancer _in vivo_ and _in vitro_, as well as reduce the risk of cancer in epidemiological studies. MCF-10A cells, regarded as a normal breast epithelial cell line, were treated with varying concentrations of DES, DAS or various dose combinations of DES and DAS concomitantly, and assessed for cell viability, DNA strand breaks, and lipid peroxidation. DES (10 Î¼M) in combination with 1, 10, or 100 Î¼M DAS resulted in a 31%, 34%, or 36% respective increase in cell viability compared to the DES treatment alone, after 24 h. At the same time point, 1, 10, and 100 Î¼M DAS were all effective in significantly reducing DES (100 Î¼M)-induced strand breaks to near that of the vehicle control. Additionally, 1 Î¼M DAS was effective in significantly reducing DES (100 Î¼M)-induced lipid peroxidation after 3 h. The results of this research suggest that DAS is effective in recovering cell viability, attenuating DNA strand breaks, and decreasing lipid peroxidation in MCF-10A cells.
