# Carotenoid database of commonly eaten Swiss vegetables and their estimated contribution to carotenoid intake

## Abstract

Carotenoids are plant pigments which are thought to decrease the risk of degenerative diseases via their antioxidant properties. The aim of this work was to create a carotenoid database for clearly identified Swiss vegetables, grown under known conditions and analyzed using a standardized protocol. We determined the six major carotenoids in the vegetables most frequently consumed in Switzerland. Chlorophyll a and b were additionally measured in green leafy vegetables. Lutein and Î²-carotene concentrations in green leafy vegetables ranged from 0.2 to 13 mg and 0.2 to 8 mg/100 g fresh matter, respectively, with the highest total carotenoid contents in _Brassicaceae_. Additionally, we identified strong correlations (_R_2 &gt; 0.9) between the lutein and Î²-carotene concentrations and the total chlorophyll contents in different botanical families. Orange and red vegetables contained a greater diversity of carotenoids, with Î±- and Î²-carotene being the predominant carotenoids in orange carrots and lycopene in tomatoes. Peppers additionally contained zeaxanthin and Î²-cryptoxanthin. Based on these data, and on the estimated consumption of the different vegetables in Switzerland, we estimate that 3.3 mg Î²-carotene, 2.2 mg lycopene and 1.8 mg lutein are consumed daily from fresh vegetables.
